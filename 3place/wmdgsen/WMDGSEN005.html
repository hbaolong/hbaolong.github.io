<h4 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h4>
<p>The Moral Elements of Civilization</p>
<p>S INCE no society can exist without order, and no order without regu-
lation, we may take it as a rule of history that the power of custom</p>
<p>varies inversely as the multiplicity of laws, much as the power of
instinct varies inversely as the multiplicity of thoughts. Some rules
are necessary for the game of life; they may differ in different groups,
but within the group they must be essentially the same. These rules may
be conven- tions, customs, morals, or laws. Conventions are forms of
behavior found expedient by a people; customs are conventions accepted
by successive generations, after natural selection through trial and
error and elimination; morals are such customs as the group considers
vital to its welfare and development. In primitive societies, where
there is no written law, these vital customs or morals regulate every
sphere of human existence, and give stability and continuity to the
social order. Through the slow</p>
<p>magic of time such customs, by long repetition, become a second
nature in the individual; if he violates them he feels a certain fear,
discomfort or shame; this is the origin of that conscience, or moral
sense, which Darwin chose as the most impressive distinction between
animals and men . 1 In its higher development conscience is social
consciousness — the feeling of the individual that he belongs to a
group, and owes it some measure of loyalty and consideration. Morality
is the cooperation of the part with the whole, and of each group with
some larger whole. Civilization, of course, would be impossible without
it.</p>
<p>I. MARRIAGE</p>
<p>The meaning of marriage — Its biological origins — Sexual com-</p>
<p>munism — Trial marriage — Group marriage-individual mar-</p>
<p>riage — Polygamy — Its eugenic value — Exogamy — Mar-</p>
<p>riage by service — By capture — By purchase — Primi-</p>
<p>tive love — The economic function of marriage</p>
<p>The first task of those customs that constitute the moral code of a
group is to regulate the relations of the sexes, for these are a
perennial source of discord, violence, and possible degeneration. The
basic form of this</p>
<p>3&lt;S</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 37</p>
<p>sexual regulation is marriage, which may be defined as the
association of mates for the care of offspring. It is a variable and
fluctuating institution, which has passed through almost every
conceivable form and experiment in the course of its history, from the
primitive care of offspring without the association of mates to the
modem association of mates without the care of offspring.</p>
<p>Our animal forefathers invented it. Some birds seem to live as repro-
ducing mates in a divorceless monogamy. Among gorillas and orang- utans
the association of the parents continues to the end of the breeding
season, and has many human features. Any approach to loose behavior on
the part of the female is severely punished by the male . 2 The orangs
of Borneo, says De Crespigny, “live in families: the male, the female,
and a young one”; and Dr. Savage reports of the gorillas that “it is not
unusual to see the ‘old folks’ sitting under a tree regaling themselves
with fruit and friendly chat, while their children are leaping around
them and swing- ing from branch to branch in boisterous merriment .” 3
Marriage is ol der than man.</p>
<p>Societies without marriage are rare, but the sedulous inquirer can
find enough of them to form a respectable transition from the
promiscuity of the lower mammals to the marriages of primitive men. In
Futuna and Hawaii the majority of the people did not marry at all;* the
Lubus mated freely and indiscriminately, and had no conception of
marriage; certain tribes of Borneo lived in marriageless association,
freer than the birds; and among some peoples of primitive Russia “the
men utilize d the women without distinction, so that no woman had her
appointed husband.” African pygmies have been described as having no
marriage institutions, but as following “their animal instincts wholly
without restraint .” 5 This primitive “nationalization of women,”
corresponding to primitive com - munism in land and food, passed away at
so early a stage that few traces of it remain. Some memory of it,
however, lingered on in divers forms: in the feeling of many nature
peoples that monogamy — which they would define as the monopoly of a
woman by one man — is unnatural and immoral ; 3 in periodic festivals of
license (still surviving faintly in our Mardi Gras), when sexual
restraints were temporarily abandoned; in the demand that a woman should
give herself — as at the Temple of Mylitta in Babylon — to any man that
solicited her, before she would be allowed to marry;* in</p>
<p>Cf. below, p. 245.</p>
<p>38 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>the custom of wife-lending, so essential to many primitive codes of
hos- pitality; and in the jus prima noctis, or right of the first night,
by which, in early feudal Europe, the lord of the manor, perhaps
representing the ancient rights of the tribe, occasionally deflowered
the bride before the bridegroom was allowed to consummate the marriage .
68</p>
<p>A variety of tentative unions gradually took the place of
indiscriminate relations. Among the Orang Sakai of Malacca a girl
remained for a time with each man of the tribe, passing from one to
another until she had made the rounds; then she began again . 7 Among
the Yakuts of Siberia, the Botocudos of South Africa, the lower classes
of Tibet, and many other peoples, marriage was quite experimental, and
could be ended at the will of either party, with no reasons given or
required. Among the Bushmen “any disagreement sufficed to end a union,
and new connections could immediately be found for both.” Among the
Damaras, according to Sir Francis Galton, “the spouse was changed almost
weekly, and I seldom knew without inquiry who the pro tempore husband of
each lady was at any particular time.” Among the Baila “women are
bandied about from man to man, and of their own accord leave one husband
for another. Young women scarcely out of their teens often have had four
or five husbands, all still living .” 8 The original word for marriage,
in Hawaii, meant to try.“ Among the Tahitians, a century ago, unions
were free and dissoluble at will, so long as there were no children; if
a child came the parents might destroy it without social reproach, or
the couple might rear the child and enter into a more permanent
relation; the man pledged his support to the woman in return for the
burden of parental care that she now assumed . 10</p>
<p>Marco Polo writes of a Central Asiatic tribe, inhabiting Peyn
(now</p>
<p>Keriya) in the thirteenth century: “If a married man goes to a
distance from home to be absent twenty days, his wife has a right, if
she is so inclined, to take another husband; and the men, on the same
principle, marry wherever t hey happen to reside .” 11 So old are the
latest innovations in marriage and morals.</p>
<p>Letourneau said of marriage that “every possible experiment
compatible with the duration of savage or barbarian societies has been
tried, or is still practised, amongst various races, without the least
thought of the moral ideas generally prevailing in Europe .” 13 In
addition to experiments in perma - nence there were experiments in
relationship. In a few cases we find “group</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 39</p>
<p>marriage,” by which a number of men belonging to one group married
collectively a number of women belonging to another group.” In Tibet,
for example, it was the custom for a group of brothers to marry a group
of sisters, and for the two groups to practise sexual communism between
them, each of the men cohabiting with each of the women. 1 * Caesar
reported a similar custom in ancient Britain.” Survivals of it appear in
the “levirate,” a custom existing among the early Jews and other ancient
peoples, by which a man was obligated to marry his brother’s widow ; 10
this was the rule that so irked Onan.</p>
<p>What was it that led men to replace the semi-promiscuity of primitive
society with individual marriage? Since, in. a great majority of nature
peoples, there are few, if any, restraints on premarital relations, it
is obvious that physical desire does not give rise to the institution of
marriage. For marriage, with its restrictions and psychological
irritations, could not possibly compete with sexual communism as a mode
of satisfying the erotic propensities of men. Nor could the individual
establishment offer at the outset any mode of rearing children that
would be obviously</p>
<p>superior to their rearing by the mother, her family, and the clan.
Some powerful economic motives must have favored the evolution of
marriage. In all probability (for again we must remind ourselves how
little we really know of origins) these motives were connected with the
rising institution of property.</p>
<p>Individual marriage came through the desire of the male to have cheap
slaves, and to avoid bequeathing his property to other men’s children.
Polygamy, or the marriage of one person to several mates, appears here
and there in the form of polyandry — the marriage of one woman to
several men — as among the Todas and some tribes of Tibet;” the custom
may still be found where males outnumber females considerably . 18 But
this custom soon falls prey to the conquering male, and polygamy has
come to mean for us, usually, what would more strictly be called
polygyny — the possession of several wives by one man. Medieval
theologians thought that Mohammed had invented polygamy, but it
antedated Islam by some years, being the prevailing mode of marriage in
the primitive world .” Many causes conspired to make it general. In
early society, because of hunting and war, the life of the male is more
violent and dangerous, and the death rate of men is higher, than that of
women. The consequent excess of women compels a choice between polygamy
and the barren</p>
<p>40 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>celibacy of a minority of women; but such celibacy is intolerable to
peoples who require a high birth rate to make up for a high death rate,
and who therefore scorn the mateless and childless woman. Again, men
like variety; as the Negroes of Angola expressed it, they were “not able
to eat always of the same dish.” Also, men like youth in their mates,
and women age rapidly in primitive communities. The women themselves
often favored polygamy; it permitted them to nurse their children
longer, and therefore to reduce the frequency of motherhood without
interfering with the erotic and philoprogenitive inclinations of the
male. Sometimes the first wife, burdened with toil, helped her husband
to secure an additional wife, so that her burden might be shared, and
additional children might raise the productive power and the wealth of
the family.” Children were economic assets, and men invested in wives in
order to draw children from them like interest. In the patriarchal
system wives and children were in effect the slaves of the man; the more
a man had of them, the richer he was. The poor man practised monogamy,
but he looked upon it as a shameful condi- tion, from which some day he
would rise to the respected position of a polygamous male.”</p>
<p>Doubtless polygamy was well adapted to the marital needs of a</p>
<p>primitive society in which women outnumbered men. It had a eu-</p>
<p>genic value superior to that of contemporary monogamy; for whereas in
modern society the most able and prudent men marry latest and have least
children, under polygamy the most able men, presumably, secured the
bests mates and had most children. Hence polygamy has survived among
practically all nature peoples, even among the majority of civil- ized
mankind; only in our day has it begun to die in the Orient. Certain
conditions, however, militated against it. The decrease in danger and
vio- lence, consequent upon a settled agricultural life, brought the
sexes towards an approximate numerical equality; and under these
circumstances open polygamy, even in primitive societies, became the
privilege of the pros- perous minority.” The mass of the people
practised a monogamy tempered</p>
<p>4 *</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>matter, which only the cleverest could manage. As property accumu-
lated, and men were loath to scatter it in small bequests, it became
desir- able to differentiate wives into “chief wife” and concubines, so
that only the children of the former should share the legacy; this
remained the status of marriage in Asia until our own generation.
Gradually the chief wife became the only wife, the concubines became
kept women in secret and apart, or they disappeared; and as Christianity
entered upon the scene, monogamy, in Europe, took the place of polygamy
as the lawful and out- ward form of sexual association. But monogamy,
like letters and the state, is artificial, and belongs to the history,
not to the origins, of civilization.</p>
<p>Whatever form the union might take, marriage was obligatory among
nearly all primitive peoples. The unmarried male had no standing in the
community, or was considered only half a man . 23 Exogamy, too, was com-
pulsory: that is to say, a man was expected to secure his wife from
another clan than his own. Whether this custom arose because the
primitive mind suspected the evil effects of close inbreeding, or
because such intergroup marriages created or cemented useful political
alliances, promoted social organization, and lessened the danger of war,
or because the capture of a wife from another tribe had become a
fashionable mark of male maturity, or because familiarity breeds
contempt and distance lends enchantment to the view — we do not know. In
any case the restriction was well-nigh uni- versal in early society; and
though it was successfully violated by the Pharaohs, the Ptolemies and
the Incas, who all favored the marriage of brother and sister, it
survived into Roman and modern law and consciously or unconsciously
moulds our behavior to this day.</p>
<p>How did the male secure his wife from another tribe? Where the matri-
archal organization was strong he was often required to go and live with
the clan of the girl whom he sought. As the patriarchal system
developed, the suitor was allowed, after a term of service to the
father, to take his bride back to his own clan; so Jacob served Laban
for Leah and Rachel. 2 * Sometimes the suitor shortened the matter with
plain, blunt force. It was an advantage as well as a distinction to have
stolen a wife; not only would she be a cheap slave, but new slaves could
be begotten of her, and these children would chain her to her slavery.
Such marriage by capture, though not the rule, occurred sporadically in
the primitive world. Among the North American Indians the women were
included in the spoils of war, and this happened so frequently that in
some tribes the husbands and their</p>
<p>42 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>wives spoke mutually unintelligible languages. The Slavs of Russia
and Serbia practised occasional marriage by capture until the last
century .* 25 Vestiges of it remain in the custom of simulating the
capture of the bride by the groom in certain wedding ceremonies.*’ All
in all it was a logical aspect of the almost incessant war of the
tribes, and a logical starting-point for that eternal war of the sexes
whose only truces are brief nocturnes and dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>As wealth grew it became more convenient to offer the father a sub-
stantial present — or a sum of money — for his daughter, rather than
serve for her in an alien clan, or risk the violence and feuds that
might come of marriage by capture. Consequently marriage by purchase and
parental arrangement was the rule in early societies . 28 Transition
forms occur; the Melanesians sometimes stole their wives, but made the
theft legal by a later payment to her family. Among some natives of New
Guinea the man abducted the girl, and then, while he and she were in
hiding, commissioned his friends to bargain with her father over a
purchase price .” The ease with which moral indignation in these matters
might be financially appeased is illuminating. A Maori mother, wailing
loudly, bitterly cursed the youth who had eloped with her daughter,
until he presented her with a blanket. “That was all I wanted,” she
said; “I only wanted to get a blanket, and therefore made this noise.”“
Usually the bride cost more than a blanket: among the Hottentots her
price was an ox or a cow; among the Croo three cows and a sheep; among
the Kaffirs six to thirty head of cattle, depend- ing upon the rank of
the girl’s family; and among the Togos sixteen dollars cash and six
dollars in goods . 81</p>
<p>Marriage by purchase prevails throughout primitive Africa, and is
still a normal institution in China and Japan; it flourished in ancient
India and Judea, and in pre-Columbian Central America and Peru;
instances of it occur in Europe today . 82 It is a natural development
of patriarchal institutions; the father owns the daughter, and may
dispose of her, within broad limits, as he sees fit. The Orinoco Indians
expressed the matter by saying that the suitor should pay the father for
rearing the girl for his use . 83 Sometimes the girl was exhibited to
potential suitors in a bride-show; so among the Somalis the bride,
richly caparisoned, was led about on horseback or on</p>
<ul>
<li>Briffault thinks that marriage by capture was a transition from
matrilocal to patri- archal marriage: the male, refusing to go and live
with the tribe or family of his wife, forced her to come to his . 36
Lippert believed that exogamy arose as a peaceable substitute for
capture ; 366 theft again graduated into trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, rv) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 43</p>
<p>foot, in an atmosphere heavily perfumed to stir the suitors to a
handsome price.“ There is no record of women objecting to marriage by
purchase; on the contrary, they took keen pride in the sums paid for
them, and scorned the woman who gave herself in marriage without a
price;“ they believed that in a “love - match” the villainous male was
getting too much for nothing.“ On the other hand, it was usual for the
father to acknowledge the bride- groom’s payment with a return gift
which, as time went on, approximated more and more in value to the sum
offered for the bride.“ Rich fathers, anxious to smooth the way for
their daughters, gradually enlarged these gifts until the institution of
the dowry took form; and the purchase of the husband by the father
replaced, or accompanied, the purchase of the wife by the suitor.“</p>
<p>In all these forms and varieties of marriage there is hardly a trace
of romantic love. We find a few cases of love-marriages among the
Papuans of New Guinea; among other primitive peoples we come upon
instances of love (in the sense of mutual devotion rather than mutual
need), but usually these attachments have nothing to do with marriage.
In simple days men married for cheap labor, profitable parentage, and
regular meals. “In Yariba,” says Lander, “marriage is celebrated by the
natives as uncon - cernedly as possible; a man thinks as little of
taking a wife as of cutting an ear of corn — affection is altogether out
of the question.”“ Since premarital</p>
<p>44 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>marry, answered honestly that he wanted a wife to secure food, water
and wood for him, and to carry his belongings on the march.“ The kiss,
which seems so indispensable to America, is quite unknown to primitive
peoples, or known only to be scorned . 41</p>
<p>In general the “savage” takes his sex philosophically, with hardly
more of metaphysical or theological misgiving than the animal; he does
not brood over it, or fly into a passion with it; it is as much a matter
of course with him as his food. He makes no pretense to idealistic
motives. Marriage is never a sacrament with him, and seldom an affair of
lavish ceremony; it is frankly a commercial transaction. It never occurs
to him to be ashamed that he subordinates emotional to practical
considerations in choosing his mate; he would rather be ashamed of the
opposite, and would demand of us, if he were as immodest as we are, some
explanation of our custom of binding a man and a woman together almost
for life because sexual desire has chained them for a moment with its
lightning. The primitive male looked upon marriage in terms not of
sexual license but of economic co- operation. He expected the woman —
and the woman expected herself — to be not so much gracious and
beautiful (though he appreciated these quali- ties in her) as useful and
industrious; she was to be an economic asset rather than a total loss;
otherwise the matter-of- fact “savage” would never have thought of
marriage at all. Marriage was a profitable partnership, not a private
debauch; it was a way whereby a man and a woman, working together, might
be more prosperous than if each worked alone. Wherever, in the history
of civilization, woman has ceased to be an economic asset in marriage,
marriage has decayed; and sometimes civilization has decayed with
it.</p>

<p>The greatest task of morals is always sexual regulation; for the
repro- ductive instinct creates problems not only within marriage, but
before and after it, and threatens at any moment to disturb social order
with its per- sistence, its intensity, its scorn of law, and its
perversions. The first prob- lem concerns premarital relations — shall
they be restricted, or free? Even among animals sex is not quite
unrestrained; the rejection of the male by</p>
<p>CHAP, rv) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 45</p>
<p>the female except in periods of rut reduces sex to a much more modest
role in the animal world than it occupies in our own lecherous species.
As Beaumarchais put it, man differs from the animal in eating without
being hungry, drinking without being thirsty, and making love at all
seasons. Among primitive peoples we find some analogue, or converse, of
animal restrictions, in the tabu placed upon relations with a woman in
her men- strual period. With this general exception premarital
intercourse is left for the most part free in the simplest societies.
Among the North American Indians the young men and women mated freely;
and these relations were not held an impediment to marriage. Among the
Papuans of New</p>
<p>Guinea sex life began at an extremely early age, and premarital
promiscu- ity was the rule.“ Similar premarital liberty obtained among
the Soyots of Siberia, the Igorots of the Philippines, the natives of
Upper Burma, the Kaffirs and Bushmen of Africa, the tribes of the Niger
and the Uganda, of New Georgia, the Murray Islands, the Andaman Islands,
Tahiti, Poly- nesia, Assam, etc.“</p>
<p>Under such conditions we must not expect to find much prostitution in
primitive society. The “oldest profession” is comparatively young; it
arises only with civilization, with the appearance of property and the
dis- appearance of premarital freedom. Here and there we find girls
selling themselves for a while to raise a dowry, or to provide funds for
the tem- ples; but this occurs only where the local moral code approves
of it as a pious sacrifice to help thrifty parents or hungry gods.“</p>
<p>Chastity is a correspondingly late development. What the
primitive</p>
<p>maiden dreaded was not the loss of virginity, but a reputation for
sterility“ premarital pregnancy was, more often than not, an aid rather
than a handi- cap in finding a husband, for it settled all doubts of
sterility, and prom- ised profitable children. The simpler tribes,
before the coming of prop- erty, seem to have held virginity in
contempt, as indicating unpopularity. The Kamchadal bridegroom who found
his bride to be a virgin was much put out, and “roundly abused her
mother for the negligent way in which she had brought up her daughter.”“
In many places virginity was consid - ered a barrier to marriage,
because it laid upon the husband the unpleasant task of violating the
tabu that forbade him to shed the blood of any mem- ber of his tribe.
Sometimes girls offered themselves to a stranger in order to break this
tabu against their marriage. In Tibet mothers anxiously sought men who
would deflower their daughters; in Malabar the girls themselves begged
the services of passers- by to the same end, “for while they were</p>
<p>46 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>virgins they could not find a husband.” In some tribes the bride was
obliged to give herself to the wedding guests before going in to her
hus- band; in others the bridegroom hired a man to end the virginity of
his bride; among certain Philippine tribes a special official was
appointed, at a high salary, to perform this function for prospective
husbands .* 8</p>
<p>What was it that changed virginity from a fault into a virtue, and
made it an element in the moral codes of all the higher civilizations?
Doubtless it was the institution of property. Premarital chastity came
as an exten- sion, to the daughters, of the proprietary feeling with
which the patri- archal male looked upon his wife. The valuation of
virginity rose when, under marriage by purchase, the virgin bride was
found to bring a higher price than her weak sister; the virgin gave
promise, by her past, of that marital fidelity which now seemed so
precious to men beset by worry lest they should leave their property to
surreptitious children.“</p>
<p>The men never thought of applying the same restrictions to
themselves; no society in history has ever insisted on the premarital
chastity of the male; no language has ever had a word for a virgin man.“
The aura of virginity was kept exclusively for daughters, and pressed
upon them in a thousands ways. The Tuaregs punished the irregularity of
a daughter or a sister with death; the Negroes of Nubia, Abyssinia,
Somaliland, etc., practised upon their daughters the cruel art of
infibulation — i.e., the attach- ment of a ring or lock to the genitals
to prevent copulation; in Burma and Siam a similar practice survived to
our own day.“ Forms of seclusion arose by which girls were kept from
providing or receiving temptation. In New Britain the richer parents
confined their daughters, through five danger- ous years, in huts
guarded by virtuous old crones; the girls were never allowed to come
out, and only their relatives could see them. Some tribes- in Borneo
kept their unmarried girls in solitary confinement . 82 From these
primitive customs to the purdah of the Moslems and the Hindus is but a
step, and indicate s again how nearly “civilization” touches “savagery.”
Modesty came with virginity and the patriarchate. There are many</p>
<p>tribes which to this day show no shame in exposing the body ; 828
indeed, some are ashamed to wear clothing. All Africa rocked with
laughter</p>
<p>when Livingstpne begged his black hosts to put on some clothing
before the arrival of his wife. The Queen of the Balonda was quite naked
when she held court for Livingstone . 88 A small minority of tribes
practise sex rela- tions publicly, without any thought of shame. 8 * At
first modesty is the feeling of the woman that she is tabu in her
periods. When marriage</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>by purchase takes form, and virginity in the daughter brings a profit
to her father, seclusion and the compulsion to virginity beget in the
girl a sense of obligation to chastity. Again, modesty is the feeling of
the wife who, under purchase marriage, feels a financial obligation to
her husband to re- frain from such external sexual relations as cannot
bring him any recom- pense. Clothing appears at this point, if motives
of adornment and pro- tection have not already engendered it; in many
tribes women wore clothing only after marriage,” as a sign of their
exclusive possession b y a husband, and as a deterrent to gallantry;
primitive man did not agree with the author of Penguin Isle that
clothing encouraged lechery. Chastity, however, bears no necessary
relation to clothing; some travelers report that morals in Africa vary
inv ersely as the amount of dress.” It is clear that what men are
ashamed of depends entirely upon the local tabus and cus- toms of their
group. Until recently a Chinese woman was ashamed to show her foot, an
Arab woman her face, a Tuareg woman her mouth; but the women of ancient
Egypt, of nineteenth-century India and of twen- tieth-century Bali
(before prurient tourists came) never thought of shame at the exposure
of their breasts.</p>
<p>We must not conclude that morals are worthless because they differ
according to time and place, and that it would be wise to show our his-
toric learning by at once discarding the moral customs of our group. A
little anthropology is a dangerous thing. It is substantially true that
— as Anatole France ironically expressed the matter — “morality is the
sum of the prejudices of a community”;“ and that, as Anacharsis put it
among the Greeks, if one were to bring together all customs considered
sacred by some group, and were then to take away all customs considered
immoral by some group, nothing would remain. But this does not prove the
worth- lessness of morals; it only shows in what varied ways social
order has been preserved. Social order is none the less necessary; the
game must still have rules in order to be played; men must know what to
expect of one another in the ordinary circumstances of life. Hence the
unanimity with which the members of a society practise its moral code is
quite as important as the contents of that code. Our heroic rejection of
the customs and morals of our tribe, upon our adolescent discovery of
their relativity, betrays the immaturity of our minds; given another
decade and we begin to under- stand that there may be more wisdom in the
moral code of the group — the formulated experience of generations of
the race — than can be explained in a college course. Sooner or later
the disturbing realization comes to us</p>
<p>48 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>that even that which we cannot understand may be true. The institu-
tions, conventions, customs and laws that make up the complex structure
of a society are the work of a hundred centuries and a billion minds;
and one mind must not expect to comprehend them in one lifetime, much
less in twenty years. We are warranted in concluding that morals are
relative, and indispensable.</p>
<p>Since old and basic customs represent a natural selection of
group</p>
<p>ways after centuries of trial and error, we must expect to find some
social utility, or survival value, in virginity and modesty, despite
their historical relativity, their association with marriage by
purchase, and their contribu- tions to neurosis. Modesty was a strategic
retreat which enabled the girl, where she had any choice, to select her
mate more deliberately, or compel him to show finer qualities before
winning her; and the very obstructions it raised against desire
generated those sentiments of romantic love which heightened her value
in his eyes. The inculcation of virginity destroyed the naturalness and
ease of primitive sexual life; but, by discouraging early sex
development and premature motherhood, it lessened the gap — which tends
to widen disruptively as civilization develops — between eco- nomic and
sexual maturity. Probably it served in this way to strengthen the
individual physically and mentally, to lengthen adolescence and train-
ing, and so to lift the level of the race.</p>
<p>As the institution of property developed, adultery graduated from a
venial into a mortal sin. Half of the primitive peoples known to us
attach no gr eat importance to it.“ The rise of property not only led to
the exaction of complete fidelity from the woman, but generated in the
male a pro- prietary attitude towards her; even when he lent her to a
guest it was because she belonged to him in body and soul. Suttee was
the completion of this conception; the woman must go down into the
master’s grave along with his other belongings. Under the patriarchate
adultery was classed with theft;“ it was, so to speak, an infringement
of patent. Punishment for it varied through all degrees of severity from
the indifference of the simpler tribes to the disembowelment of
adulteresses among certain California Indians.“ After centuries of
punishment the new virtue of wifely fidelity was firmly established, and
had generated an appropriate conscience in the feminine heart. Many
Indian tribes surprised their conquerors by the un- approachable virtue
of their squaws; and certain male travelers have hoped that the women of
Europe and America might some day equal in marital faithfulness the
wives of the Zulus and the Papuans.“</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 49</p>
<p>It was easier for the Papuans, since among them, as among most primi-
tive peoples, there were few impediments to the divorce of the woman by
the man. Unions seldom lasted more than a few years among the Amer- ican
Indians. “A large proportion of the old and middle - aged men,” says
Schoolcraft, “have had many different wives, and their children,
scattered</p>
<p>In general, throughout history, men have wanted many children, and
therefore have called motherhood sacred; while women, who know more
about reproduction, have secretly rebelled against this heavy
assignment, and have used an endless variety of means to reduce the
burdens of ma- ternity. Primitive men do not usually care to restrict
population; under normal conditions children are profitable, and the
male regrets only that they cannot all be sons. It is the woman who
invents abortion, infanticide and contraception — for even the last
occurs, sporadically, among primitive peo- ples . 00 It is astonishing
to find how similar are the motives of the “savage” to the “civilized”
woman in preventing birth: to escape the burden of rearing offspring, to
preserve a youthful figure, to avert the disgrace of extramarital
motherhood, to avoid death, etc. The simplest means of re- ducing
maternity was the refusal of the man by the woman during the period of
nursing, which might be prolonged for many years. Sometimes, as among
the Cheyenne Indians, the women developed the custom of refusing to bear
a second child until the first was ten years old. In New Britain the
women had no children till two or four years after marriage.</p>
<p>50 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>The Guaycurus of Brazil were constantly diminishing because the women
would bear no children till the age of thirty. Among the Papuans
abortion was frequent; “children are burdensome,” said the women; “we
are weary</p>
<p>When abortion failed, infanticide remained. Most nature peoples per-
mitted the killing of the newborn child if it was deformed, or diseased,
or a bastard, or if its mother had died in giving it birth. As if any
reason would be good in the task of limiting population to the available
means of subsistence, many tribes killed infants whom they considered to
have been bom under unlucky circumstances: so the Bondei natives
strangled all children who entered the world headfirst; the Kamchadals
killed babes bom in stormy weather; Madagascar tribes exposed, drowned,
or buried alive children who made their debut in March or April, or on a
Wednes- day or a Friday, or in the last week of the month. If a woman
gave birth to twins it was, in some tribes, held proof of adultery,
since no man could be the father of two children at the same time; and
therefore one or both of the children suffered death. The practice of
infanticide was particularly prevalent among nomads, who found children
a problem on their long marches. The Bangerang tribe of Victoria killed
half their children at birth; the Lenguas of the Paraguayan Chaco
allowed only one child per family per seven years to survive; the
Abipones achieved a French econ- omy in population by rearing a boy and
a girl in each household, killing off other offspring as fast as they
appeared. Where famine conditions existed or threatened, most tribes
strangled the newborn, and some tribes ate them. Usually it was the girl
that was most subject to infanticide; occa- sionally she was tortured to
death with a view to inducing the soul to appear, in its next
incarnation, in the form of a boy.“ Infanticide was prac- tised without
cruelty and without remorse; for in the first moments after delivery,
apparently, the mother felt no instinctive love for the child.</p>
<p>Once the child had been permitted to live a few days, it was safe</p>
<p>against infanticide; soon parental love was evoked by its helpless
sim- plicity, and in most cases it was treated more affectionately by
its primi- tive parents than the average child of the higher races.“ For
lack of milk or soft food the mother nursed the child from two to four
years, sometimes for twelve;™ one traveler describes a boy who had
learned to smoke before he was weaned ; 71 and often a youngster running
about with other children would interrupt his play — or his work — to go
and be nursed by his</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 51</p>
<p>mother.” The Negro mother at work carried her infant on her back, and
sometimes fed it by slinging her breasts over her shoulder.” Primit ive
dis- cipline was indulgent but not ruinous; at an early age the child
was left to face for itself the consequences of its stupidity, its
insolence, or its pug- nacity; and learning went on apace. Filial, as
well as parental, love was highly develop ed in natural society.”</p>
<p>Dangers and disease were frequent in primitive childhood, and mortal-
ity was high. Youth was brief, for at an early age marital and martial
re- sponsibility began, and soon the individual was lost in the heavy
tasks of replenishing and defending the group. The women were consumed
in car- ing for children, the men in providing for them. When the
youngest child had been reared the parents were worn out; as little
space remained for individual life at the end as at the beginning.
Individualism, like liberty, is a luxury of civilization. Only with the
dawn of history were a suffi- cient number of men and women freed from
the burdens of hunger, reproduction and war to create the intangible
values of leisure, culture and art.</p>

<p>Part of the function of parentage is the transmission of a moral
code. For the child is more animal than human; it has humanity thrust
upon it day by day as it receives the moral and mental heritage of the
race. Bio- logically it is badly equipped for civilization, since its
instincts provide only for traditional and basic situations, and include
impulses more adapted to the jungle than to the town. Every vice was
once a virtue, necessary in the struggle for existence; it became a vice
only when it survived the condi- tions that made it indispensable; a
vice, therefore, is not an advanced form of behavior, but usually an
atavistic throwback to ancient and superseded ways. It is one purpose of
a moral code to adjust the unchanged — or slowly changing — impulses of
human nature to the changing needs and circum- stances of social
life.</p>
<p>Greed, acquisitiveness, dishonesty, cruelty and violence were for so
many generations useful to animals and men that not all our laws,
our</p>
<p>52 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>education, our morals and our religions can quite stamp them out;
some of them, doubtless, have a certain survival value even today. The
animal gorges himself because he does not know when he may find food
again; this uncertainty is the origin of greed. The Yakuts have been
known to eat forty pounds of meat in one day; and similar stories, only
less heroic, are told of the Eskimos and the natives of Australia.”
Economic security is too recent an achievement of civilization to have
eliminated this natural greed; it still appears in the insatiable
acquisitiveness whereby the fretful modem man or woman stores up gold,
or other goods, that may in emer- gency be turned into food. Greed for
drink is not as widespread as greed for food, for most human
aggregations have centered around some water supply. Nevertheless, the
drinking of intoxicants is almost universal; not so much because men are
greedy as because they are cold and wish to be warmed, or unhappy and
wish to forget — or simply because the water available to them is not
fit to drink.</p>
<p>Dishonesty is not so ancient as greed, for hunger is older than
property. The simplest “savages” seem to be the most honest.™ “Their
word is sacred,” said Kolben of the Hottentots; they know “nothing of
the cor - ruptness and faithless arts of Europe .” 77 As international
communica - tions improved, this naive honesty disappeared; Europe has
taught the gentle art to the Hottentots. In general, dishonesty rises
with civilization, because under civilization the stakes of diplomacy
are larger, there are more things to be stolen, and education makes men
clever. When prop- erty develops among primitive men, lying and stealing
come in its train.™</p>
<p>Crimes of violence are as old as greed; the struggle for food, land
and mates has in every generation fed the earth with blood, .and has
offered a dark background for the fitful light of civilization.
Primitive man was cruel because he had to be; life taught him that he
must have an arm always read y to strike, and a heart apt for “natural
killing.” The blackest page in anthropology is the story of primitive
torture, and of the joy that many primitive men and women seem to have
taken in the infliction of pain.” Much of this cruelty was associated
with war; within the tribe manners were less ferocious, and primitive
men treated one another — and even their slaves — with a quite civilized
kindliness.” But since men had to kill vigorously in war, they learned
to kill also in time of peace; for to many a primitive mind no argument
is settled until one of the disputants is dead. Among many tribes
murder, even of another member of the same</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>clan, aroused far less horror than it used to do with us. The
Fuegians pun- ished a murderer merely by exiling him until his fellows
had forgotten his crime. The Kaffirs considered a murderer unclean, and
required that he should blacken his face with charcoal; but after a
while, if he washed himself, rinsed his mouth, and dyed himself brown,
he was received into society again. The savages of Futuna, like our own,
looked upon a mur- derer as a hero . 81 In several tribes no woman would
marry a man who had not killed some one, in fair fight or foul; hence
the practice of head- hunting, which survives in the Philippines today.
The Dyak who brought back most heads from such a man-hunt had the choice
of all the girls in his village; these were eager for his favors,
feeling that through him they might become the mothers of brave and
potent men .* 92</p>
<p>Where food is dear life is cheap. Eskimo sons must kill their parents
when these have become so old as to be helpless and useless; failure to
kill them in such cases would be considered a breach of filial duty.“
Even his own life seems cheap to primitive man, for he kills himself
with a readi- ness rivaled only by the Japanese. If an offended person
commits suicide, or mutilates himself, the offender must imitate him or
become a pariah ; 84 so old is hara-kiri. Any reason may suffice for
suicide: some Indian women of North America killed themselves because
their men had assumed the privilege of scolding them; and a young
Trobriand Islander committed suicide because his wife had smoked all his
tobacco . 85</p>
<p>To transmute greed into thrift, violence into argument, murder into
litigation, and suicide into philosophy has been part of the task of
civili- zation. It was a great advance when the strong consented to eat
the weak by due process of law. No society can survive if it allows its
members to behave toward one another in the same way in which it
encourages them to behave as a group toward other groups; internal
cooperation is the first law of external competition. The struggle for
existence is not ended by mutual aid, it is incorporated, or transferred
to the group. Other things equal, the ability to compete with rival
groups will be proportionate to the ability of the individual members
and families to combine with one another. Hence every society inculcates
a moral code, and builds up in the heart of the individual, as its
secret allies and aides, social dispositions that mitigate the natural
war of life; it encourages — by calling them virtues —</p>
<p>This is half the theme of Synge’s drama, The Playboy of the Western
World.</p>
<p>54 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>those qualities or habits in the individual which redound to the
advantage of the group, and discourages contrary qualities by calling
them vices. In this way the individual is in some outward measure
socialized, and the animal becomes a citizen.</p>
<p>It was hardly more difficult to generate social sentiments in the
soul of the “savage” than it is to raise them now in the heart of modem
man. The struggle for life encouraged communalism, but the struggle for
property intensifies individualism. Primitive man was perhaps readier
than con- temporary man to cooperate with his fellows; social solidarity
came more easily to him since he had more perils and interests in common
with his group, and less possessions to separate him from the rest . 80
The natural man was violent and greedy; but he was also kindly and
generous, ready to share even with strangers, and to make presents to
his guests . 87 Every schoolboy knows that primitive hospitality, in
many tribes, went to the extent of offering to the traveler the wife or
daughter of the host . 88 To decline such an offer was a serious
offense, not only to the host but to the woman; these are among the
perils faced by missionaries. Often the later treatment of the guest was
determined by the manner in which he had acquitted himself of these
responsibilities . 89 Uncivilized man appears to have felt proprietary,
but not sexual, jealousy; it did not disturb him that his wife had
“known” men before marrying him, or now slept with his guest; but as her
owner, rather than her lover, he would have been incensed to find her
cohabiting with an- other man without his consent. Some African husbands
lent their wives to strangers for a consideration . 90</p>
<p>The rules of courtesy were as complex in most simple peoples as in
ad- vanced nations . 01 Each group had formal modes of salutation and
farewell. Two individuals, on meeting, rubbed noses, or smelled each
other, or gently bit each other ; 92 as we have seen, they never kissed.
Some crude tribes were more polite than the modern average; the Dyak
head-hunters, we are told, were “gentle and peaceful” in their home
life, and the Indians of Central America considered the loud talking and
brusque behavior of the white man as signs of poor breeding and a
primitive culture . 03</p>
<p>Almost all groups agree in holding other groups to be inferior to
them- selves. The American Indians looked upon themselves as the chosen
people, specially created by the Great Spirit as an uplifting example
for mankind. One Indian tribe called itself “The Only Men”; another
called itself “Men of Men”; the Caribs said, “We alone are people.” The
Eskimos believed that the Europeans had come to Greenland to learn
manners and virtues . 04 Consequently it seldom occurred to primitive
man to extend to other tribes the moral restraints which he acknowledged
in dealing with his own; he</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 55</p>
<p>frankly conceived it to be the function of morals to give strength
and co- herence to his group against other groups. Commandments and
tabus ap- plied only to the people of his tribe; with others, except
when they were his guests, he might go as far as he dared . 65</p>
<p>Moral progress in history lies not so much in the improvement of the
moral code as in the enlargement of the area within which it is applied.
The morals of modem man are not unquestionably superior to those of
primitive man, though the two groups of codes may differ considerably in
content, practice and profession; but modern morals are, in normal
times, extended — though with decreasing intensity — to a greater number
of people than before.* As tribes were gathered up into those larger
units called states, morality overflowed its tribal bounds; and as
communication — or a common danger — united and assimilated states,
morals seeped through fron- tiers, and some men began to apply their
commandments to all Europeans, to all whites, at last to all men.
Perhaps there have always been idealists who wished to love all men as
their neighbors, and perhaps in every gen- eration they have been futile
voices crying in a wilderness of nationalism and war. But probably the
number — even the relative number — of such men has increased. There are
no morals in diplomacy, and la politique rta pas (Tentrailles ; but
there are morals in international trade, merely because such trade
cannot go on without some degree of restraint, regulation, and con-
fidence. Trade began in piracy; it culminates in morality.</p>
<p>Few societies have been content to rest their moral codes upon so</p>
<p>frankly rational a basis as economic and political utility. For the
individ- ual is not endowed by nature with any disposition to
subordinate his per- sonal interests to those of the group, or to obey
irksome regulations for which there are no visible means of enforcement.
To provide, so to speak, an invisible watchman, to strengthen the social
impulses against the individualistic by powerful hopes and fears,
societies have not in- vented but made use of, religion. The ancient
geographer Strabo expressed the most advanced views on this subiect
nineteen hundred years ago:</p>
<p>For in dealing with a crowd of women, at least, or with any</p>
<p>promiscuous mob, a philosopher cannot influence them by reason</p>
<p>or exhort them to reverence, piety and faith; nay, there is need
of</p>
<p>religious fear also, and this cannot be aroused without myths and</p>
<p>marvels. For thunderbolt, aegis, trident, torches, snakes,
thyrsus-</p>

<li>However, the range within which the moral code is applied has
narrowed since the Middle Ages, as the result of the rise of
nationalism.</li>

<p>lances — arms of the gods — are myths, and so is the entire
ancient</p>
<p>theology. But the founders of states gave their sanction to these</p>
<p>things as bugbears wherewith to scare the simple-minded. Now</p>
<p>since this is the nature of mythology, and since it has come to
have</p>
<p>its place in the social and civil scheme of life as well as in the
his -</p>
<p>tory of actual facts, the ancients clung to their system of
education</p>
<p>for children and applied it up to the age of maturity; and by
means</p>
<p>of poetry they believed that they could satisfactorily discipline</p>
<p>every period of life. But now, after a long time, the writing of</p>
<p>history and the present-day philosophy have come to the front.</p>
<p>Philosophy, however, is for the few, whereas poetry is more
useful</p>
<p>to the people at large.”</p>
<p>Morals, then, are soon endowed with religious sanctions, because mys-
tery and supernaturalism lend a weight which can never attach to things
empirically known and genetically understood; men are more easily ruled
by imagination than by science. But was this moral utility the source or
origin of religion?</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>RELIGION</li>
</ol>
<p>Primitive atheists</p>
<p>If we define religion as the worship of supernatural forces, we must
observe at the outset that some peoples have apparently no religion at
all. Certain Pygmy tribes of Africa had no observable cult or rites;
they had no totem, no fetishes, and no gods; they buried their dead
without cere- mony, and seem to have paid no further attention to them;
they lacked even superstitions, if we may believe otherwise incredible
travelers.“ 10 The dwarfs of the Cameroon recognized only malevolent
deities, and did noth- ing to placate them, on the ground that it was
useless to try. The Ved- dahs of Ceylon went no further than to admit
the possibility of gods and immortal souls; but they offered no prayers
or sacrifices. Asked about God they answered, as puzzled as the latest
philosopher: “Is he on a rock? On a white- ant hill? On a tree? I never
saw a god!” Mb The North Amer - ican Indians conceived a god, but did
not worship him; like Epicurus they thought him too remote to be
concerned in their affairs.’ 6 ’ An Abipone Indian rebuffed a
metaphysical inquirer in a manner quite Confucian: “Our grandfathers and
our great-grandfathers were wont to contemplate the earth alone,
solicitous only to see whether the plain afford grass and water</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OP CIVILIZATION 57</p>
<p>for their horses. They never troubled themselves about what went on
in the heavens, and who was the creator and governor of the stars.” The
Eskimos, when asked who had made the heavens and the earth, always
replied, “We do not know.”“ d A Zulu was asked: “When you see the sun
rising and setting, and the trees growing, do you know who made them and
governs them?” He answered, simply: “No, we see them, but cannot tell
how they came; we suppose that they came by themse lves .” 000</p>
<p>Such cases are exceptional, and the old belief that religion is
universal is substantially correct. To the philosopher this is one of
the outstanding facts of history and psychology; he is not content to
know that all re- ligions contain much nonsense, but rather he is
fascinated by the problem of the antiquity and persistence of belief.
What are the sources of the indestructible piety of mankind?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Sources of Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>Fear — W onder — Dreams — The soul — Animism</p>
<p>Fear, as Lucretius said, was the first mother of the gods. Fear,
above all, of death. Primitive life was beset with a thousand dangers,
and seldom ended with natural decay; long before old age could come,
violence or some strange disease carried off the great majority of men.
Hence early man did not believe that death was ever natural” he
attributed it to the</p>
<p>tell them to cast their skins; so shall they avoid death. But tell
the serpents that they must henceforth die.” Korvouva mixed the
messages; he delivered the secret of immortality to the snakes, and the
doom of death to men . 08 Many tribes thought that death was due to the
shrinkage of the skin, and that man would be immortal if only he could
moult . 00</p>
<p>Fear of death, wonder at the causes of chance events or
unintelligible happenings, hope for divine aid and gratitude for good
fortune, cooper- ated to generate religious belief. Wonder and mystery
adhered particularly to sex and dreams, and the mysterious influence of
heavenly bodies upon the earth and man. Primitive man marveled at the
phantoms that he saw in sleep, and was struck with terror when he
beheld, in his dreams, the figures of those whom he knew to be dead. He
buried his dead in the</p>
<p>58 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>earth to prevent their return; he buried victuals and goods with the
corpse lest it should come back to curse him; sometimes he left to the
dead the house in which death had come, while he himself moved on to
another shelter; in some places he carried the body out of the house not
through a door but through a hole in the wall, and bore it rapidly three
times around the dwelling, so that the spirit might forget the entrance
and never haunt the home . 100</p>
<p>Such experiences convinced early man that every living thing had
a</p>
<p>soul, or secret life, within it, which could be separated from the
body in illness, sleep or death. “Let no one wake a man brusquely,” said
one of the Upanishads of ancient India, “for it is a matter difficult of
cure if the soul find not its way back to him .”“ 1 Not man alone but
all things had souls; the external world was not insensitive or dead, it
was intensely alive ; 100 if this were not so, thought primitive
philosophy, nature would be full of inexplicable occurrences, like the
motion of the sun, or the death- dealing lightning, or the whispering of
the trees. The personal way of conceiving objects and events preceded
the impersonal or abstract; religion preceded philosophy. Such animism
is the poetry of religion, and the religion of poetry. We may see it at
its lowest in the wonder-struck eyes of a dog that watches a paper blown
before him by the wind, and perhaps believes that a spirit moves the
paper from within; and we find the same feeling at its highest in the
language of the poet. To the primitive mind — and to the poet in all
ages — mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, stars, sun, moon and sky are
sacramentally holy things, because they are the outward and visible
signs of inward and invisible souls. To the early Greeks the sky was the
god Ouranos, the moon was Selene, the earth was Gaea, the sea was
Poseidon, and everywhere in the woods was Pan. To the ancient Germans
the forest primeval was peopled with genii, elves, trolls, giants,
dwarfs and fairies; these sylvan creatures survive in the music of
Wagner and the poetic dramas of Ibsen. The simpler peasants of Ireland
still believe in fairies, and no poet or playwright can belong to the
Irish literary revival unless he employs them. There is wisdom as well
as beauty in this animism; it is good and nourishing to treat all things
as alive. To the sensitive spirit, says the most sensitive of
contemporary writers,</p>
<p>Nature begins to present herself as a vast congeries of separate</p>
<p>living entities, some visible, some invisible, but all possessed
of</p>

<li>The Objects of Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>The sun — The stars — The earth — Sex — Animals — Totemism — The
transition to human gods — Ghost-worship — Ancestor-worship</p>
<p>Since all things have souls, or contain hidden gods, the objects of
re- ligious worship are numberless. They fall into six classes:
celestial, ter- restrial, sexual, animal, human, and divine. Of course
we shall never know which of our universe of objects was worshiped
first. One of the first was probably the moon. Just as our own folk-lore
speaks of the u man in the moon,” so primitive legend conceived the moon
as a bold male who caused women to menstruate by seducing them. He was a
favorite god with women, who worshiped him as their protecting deity.
The pale orb was also the measure of time; it was believed to control
the weather, and to make both rain and snow; even the frogs prayed to it
for rain. 101</p>
<p>We do not know when the sun replaced the moon as the lord of the sky
in primitive religion. Perhaps it was when vegetation replaced hunt-
ing, and the transit of the sun determined the seasons of sowing and
reaping, and its heat was recognized as the main cause of the bounty of
the soil. Then the earth became a goddess fertilized by the hot rays,
and men wor- shiped the great orb as the father of all things living.
100 From this simple beginning sun-worship passed down into the pagan
faiths of antiquity, and many a later god was only a personification of
the sun. Anaxagoras was exiled by the learned Greeks because he ventured
the guess that the sun was not a god, but merely a ball of fire, about
the size of the Pelo- ponnesus. The Middle Ages kept a relic of
sun-worship in the halo</p>
<p>pictured around the heads of saints, 100 and in our own day the
Emperor of Japan is regarded by most of his people as an incarnation of
the sun- god. 107 There is hardly any superstition so old but it can be
found flourish- ing somewhere today. Civilization is the precarious
labor and luxury of a minority; the basic masses of mankind hardly
change from millennium to millennium.</p>
<p>6o</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Like the sun and the moon, every star contained or was a god, and</p>
<p>moved at the command of its indwelling spirit. Under Christianity
these spirits became guiding angels, star-pilots, so to speak; and
Kepler was not too scientific to believe in them. The sky itself was a
great god, wor- shiped devotedly as giver and withholder of rain. Among
many primitive peoples the word for god meant sky; among the Lubari and
the Dinkas it meant rain. Among the Mongols the supreme god was T engri
— xhe sky; in China it was Ti — the sky; in Vedic India it was Dyaus
pitar — the “father sky”; among the Greeks it was Zeus — the sky, the
“cloud - compeller”; among the Persians it was Ahura — the “azure sky”;™
and among ourselves men still ask “Heaven” to protect them. The central
point i n most primi- tive mythology is the fertile mating of earth and
sky.</p>
<p>For the earth, too, was a god, and every main aspect of it was
presided over by some deity. Trees had souls quite as much as men, and
it was plain murder to cut them down; the North American Indians
sometimes attributed their defeat and decay to the fact that the whites
had leveled the trees whose spirits had protected the Red Men. In the
Molucca Islands blossoming trees were treated as pregnant; no noise,
fire, or other disturb- ance was permitted to mar their peace; else,
like a frightened woman, they might drop their fruit before time. In
Amboyna no loud sounds were allowed near the rice in bloom lest it
should abort into straw . 100 The ancient Gauls worshiped the trees of
certain sacred forests; and the Druid priests of England reverenced as
holy that mistletoe of the oak which still suggests a pleasant ritual.
The veneration of trees, springs, rivers and mountains is the oldest
traceable religion of Asia . 110 Many mountains were holy places, homes
of thundering gods. Earthquakes were the shoulder- shrugging of irked or
irate deities: the Fijians ascribed such agitations to the earth- god’s
turning over in his sleep; and the Samoans, when the soil trembled,
gnawed the ground and prayed to the god Mafuie to stop, lest he should
shake the planet to pieces . 111 Almost everywhere the earth was the
Great Mother; our language, which is often the precipitate of primi-
tive or unconscious beliefs, suggests to this day a kinship between
matter ( materia ) and mother (mater)™ Ishtar and Cybele, Demeter and
Ceres, Aphrodite and Venus and Freya — these are comparatively late
forms of the ancient goddesses of the earth, whose fertility constituted
the bounty of the fields; their birth and marriage, their death and
triumphant resurrec- tion were conceived as the symbols or causes of the
sprouting, the decay.</p>
<p>6 1</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>and the vernal renewal of all vegetation. These deities reveal by
their gender the primitive association of agriculture with woman. When
agri- culture became the dominant mode of human life, the vegetation
goddesses reigned supreme. Most early gods were of the gentler sex; they
were superseded by male deities presumably as a heavenly reflex of the
vic- torious patriarchal family . 113</p>
<p>Just as the profound poetry of the primitive mind sees a secret
divinity in the growth of a tree, so it sees a supernatural agency in
the conception or birth of a child. The “savage” does not know anything
about the ovum or the sperm; he sees only the external structures
involved, and deifies them; they, too, have spirits in them, and must be
worshiped, for are not these mysteriously creative powers the most
marvelous of all? In them, even more than in the soil, the miracle of
fertility and growth appears; there- fore they must be the most direct
embodiments of the divine potency. Nearly all ancient peoples worshiped
sex in some form and ritual, and not the lowest people but the highest
expressed their worship most com- pletely; we shall find such worship in
Egypt and India, Babylonia and Assyria, Greece and Rome. The sexual
character and functions of primi- tive deities were held in high regard
, 114 not through any obscenity of mind, but through a passion for
fertility in women and in the earth. Certain animals, like the bull and
the snake, were worshiped as apparently possess- ing or symbolizing in a
high degree the divine power of reproduction. The snake in the story of
Eden is doubtless a phallic symbol, representing sex as the origin of
evil, suggesting sexual awakening as the beginning of the knowledge of
good and evil, and perhaps insinuating a certain pro- verbial connection
between mental innocence and bliss.*</p>
<p>There is hardly an animal in nature, from the Egyptian scarab to the
Hindu elephant, that has not somewhere been worshiped as a god. The
Ojibwa Indians gave the name of totem to their special sacred animal, to
the clan that worshiped it, and to any member of the clan; and this con-
fused word has stumbled into anthropology as totemism, denoting vaguely
any worship of a particular object — usually an animal or a plant — as
especially sacred to a group. Varieties of totemism have been found
scattered over apparently unconnected regions of the earth, from the
Indian tribes of North America to the natives of Africa, the
Dravidians</p>
<h1 id="cf-.-chap-xii-vi-below.">Cf . Chap, xii, § vi below.</h1>
<p>6l THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>of India, and the tribes of Australia . 116 The totem as a religious
object helped to unify the tribe, whose members thought themselves bound
up with it or descended from it; the Iroquois, in semi-Darwinian
fashion, believed that they were sprung from the primeval mating of
women with bears, wolves and deer. The totem — as object or as symbol —
became a useful sign of relationship and distinction for primitive
peoples, and lapsed, in the course of secularization, into a mascot or
emblem, like the lion or eagle of nations, the elk or moose of our
fraternal orders, and those dumb animals that are used to represent the
elephantine immobility and mulish obstreperousness of our political
parties. The dove, the fish and the lamb, in the symbolism of nascent
Christianity, were relics of totemic adoration; even the lowly pig was
once a totem of prehistoric Jews .” 6 In most cases the totem animal was
tabu — i.e., forbidden, not to be touched; under cer- tain circumstances
it might be eaten, but only as a religious act, amounting to the ritual
eating of the god.* The Gallas of Abyssinia ate in solemn ceremony the
fish that they worshiped, and said, “We feel the spirit</p>
<p>moving within us as we eat.” The good missionaries who preached the
Gospel to the Gallas were shocked to find among these simple folk a
ritual so strangely similar to the central ceremony of the Mass .
119</p>
<p>Probably fear was the origin of totemism, as of so many cults;
men</p>
<p>prayed to animals because the animals were powerful, and had to be
appeased. As hunting cleared the woods of the beasts, and gave way to
the comparative security of agricultural life, the worship of animals
de- clined, though it never quite disappeared; and the ferocity of the
first human gods was probably carried over from the animal deities whom
they replaced. The transition is visible in those famous stories of
meta- morphoses, or changes of form, that are found in the Ovids of all
languages, and tell how gods had been, or had become, animals. Later the
animal qualities adhered to them obstinately, as the odor of the stable
might loyally attend some rural Casanova; even in the complex mind of
Homer glaucopis Athene had the eyes of an owl, and Here bodpis had the
eyes of a cow. Egyptian and Babylonian gods or ogres with the face of a
human being</p>
<ul>
<li>Freud, with characteristic imaginativeness, believes that the totem
was a transfigured symbol of the father, revered and hated for his
omnipotence, and rebelliously murdered and eaten by his sons. 117
Durkheim thought that the totem was a symbol of the clan, re vered and
hated (hence held “sacred” and “unclean”) by the individual for its
omnipo - tence and irksome dictatorship; and that the religious attitude
was originally the feeling of the individual toward die authoritarian
group. 118</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 63</p>
<p>and the body of a beast reveal the same transition and make the same
confession — that many human gods were once animal deities. 1 *</p>
<p>Most human gods, however, seem to have been, in the beginning, merely
idealized dead men. The appearance of the dead in dreams was enough to
establish the worship of the dead, for worship, if not the child, is at
least the brother, of fear. Men who had been powerful during life, and
there- fore had been feared, were especially likely to be worshiped
after their death. 1 ” Among several primitive peoples the word for god
actually meant “a dead man”; even today the English word spirit and the
German word Geist mean both ghost and soul. .The Greeks invoked their
dead precisely as the Christians were to invoke the saints. 1 ” So
strong was the belief - first generated in dreams — in the continued
life of the dead, that primitive men sometimes sent messages to them in
the most literal way; in one tribe the chief, to convey such a letter,
recited it verbally to a slave, and then cut off his head for special
delivery; if the chief forgot something he sent another decapitated
slave as a postscript. 1 ”</p>
<p>Gradually the cult of the ghost became the worship of ancestors. All
the dead were feared, and had to be propitiated, lest they should curse
and blight the lives of the living. This ancestor-worship was so well
adapted to promote social authority and continuity, conservatism and
order, that it soon spread to every region of the earth. It flourished
in Egypt, Greece and Rome, and survives vigorously in China and Japan
today; many peoples worship ancestors but no god. 1 ”* The institution
held the family power - fully together despite the hostility of
successive generations, and provided an invisible structure for many
early societies. And just as compulsion grew into conscience, so fear
graduated into love; the ritual of ancestor- worship, probably generated
by terror, later aroused the sentiment of awe, and finally developed
piety and devotion. It is the tendency of gods to begin as ogres and to
end as loving fathers; the idol passes into an ideal as the growing
security, peacefulness and moral sense of the worshipers pacify and
transform the features of their once ferocious deities. The slow
progress of civilization is reflected in the tardy amiability of the
gods.</p>
<p>The idea of a human god was a late step in a long development; it was
slowly differentiated, through many stages, out of the conception of an
ocean or multitude of spirits and ghosts surrounding and inhabiting

<p>thing. From the fear and worship of vague and formless spirits men
seem to have passed to adoration of celestial, vegetative and sexual
powers, then to reverence for animals, and worship of ancestors. The
notion of God as Father was probably derived from ancestor- worship; it
meant originally that men had been physically begotten by the gods. 121
In primitive theology there is no sharp or generic distinction between
gods and men; to the early Greeks, for example, their gods were
ancestors, and their ancestors were gods. A further development came
when, out of the medley of ancestors, certain men and women who had been
especially distinguished were singled out for clearer deification; so
the greater kings became gods, sometimes even before their death. But
with this development we reach the historic civilizations.</p>

<li>The Methods of Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>Magic — Vegetation rites — Festivals of license — Myths of the</p>
<p>resurrected god — Magic and superstition — Magic and</p>
<p>science — Priests</p>
<p>Having conceived a world of spirits, whose nature and intent were</p>
<p>unknown to him, primitive man sought, to propitiate them and to
enlist them in his aid. Hence to animism, which is the essence of
primitive re- ligion, was added magic, which is the soul of primitive
ritual. The Poly- nesians recognized a very ocean of magic power, which
they called mana; the magician, they thought, merely tapped this
infinite supply of miraculous capacity. The methods by which the
spirits, and later the gods, were sub- orned to human purposes were for
the most part “sympathetic magic”— a desired action was suggested to the
deities by a partial or imitative perform- ance of the action by men. To
make rain fall some primitive magicians poured water out upon the
ground, preferably from a tree. The Kaffirs, threatened by drought,
asked a missionary to go into the fields with an opened umbrella. 120 In
Sumatra a barren woman made an image of a child and held it in her lap,
hoping thereby to become pregnant. In the Babar Archipelago the would-be
mother fashioned a doll out of red cotton, pre- tended to suckle it, and
repeated a magic formula; then she sent word through the village that
she was pregnant, and her friends came to congratulate her; only a very
obstinate reality could refuse to emulate this imagination. Among the
Dyaks of Borneo the magician, to ease the pains of a woman about to
deliver, would go through the contortions of childbirth himself,</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 6 5</p>
<p>as a magic suggestion to the foetus to come forth; sometimes the
magician slowly rolled a stone down his belly and dropped it to the
ground, in the hope that the backward child would imitate it. In the
Middle Ages a</p>
<p>spell was cast upon an enemy by sticking pins into a waxen image of
him;™ the Peruvian Indians b urned people in effigy, and called it
burning the soul . 138 Even the modem mob is not above such primitive
magic.</p>
<p>These methods of suggestion by example were applied especially to the
fertilization of the soil. Zulu medicine-men fried the genitals of a man
who had died in full vigor, ground the mixture into a powder, and
strewed it over the fields . 139 Some peoples chose a King and Queen of
the May, or a Whitsun bridegroom and bride, and married them publicly,
so that the soil might take heed and flower forth. In certain localities
the rite included the public consummation of the marriage, so that
Nature, though she might be nothing but a dull clod, would have no
excuse for misunder- standing her duty. In Java the peasants and their
wives, to ensure the fertility of the rice-fields, mated in the midst of
them . 180 For primitive men did not conceive the growth of the soil in
terms of nitrogen; they thought of it — apparently without knowing of
sex in plants — in the same terms as those whereby they interpreted the
fruitfulness of woman; our very terms recall their poetic faith.</p>
<p>Festivals of promiscuity, coming in nearly all cases at the season
of</p>
<p>sowing, served partly as a moratorium on morals (recalling the
compara- tive freedom of sex relations in earlier days), partly as a
means of fertilizing the wives of sterile men, and partly as a ceremony
of suggestion to the earth in spring to abandon her wintry reserve,
accept the proffered seed, and prepare to deliver herself of a generous
litter of food. Such festivals appear among a great number of nature
peoples, but particularly among the Cameroons of the Congo, the Kaffirs,
the Hottentots and the Bantus. “Their harvest festivals,” says the
Reverend H. Rowley of the Bantus,</p>
<p>are akin in character to the feasts of Bacchus. … It is
impossible</p>
<p>to witness them without being ashamed. . . . Not only is full
sexual</p>
<p>license permitted to the neophytes, and indeed in most cases en-</p>
<p>joined, but any visitor attending the festival is encouraged to
indulge in licentiousness. Prostitution is freely indulged in, and
adultery</p>
<p>is not viewed with any sense of heinousness, on account of the</p>
<p>surroundings. No man attending the festival is allowed to have</p>
<p>intercourse with his wife . 181</p>
<p>66 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Similar festivals appear in the historic civilizations: in the
Bacchic cele- brations of Greece, the Saturnalia of Rome, the Fete des
Fous in medieval France, May Day in England, and the Carnival or Mardi
Gras of con-</p>
<p>temporary ways.</p>
<p>Here and there, as among the Pawnees and the Indians of Guayaquil,
vegetation rites took on a less attractive form. A man — or, in later
and milder days, an animal — was sacrificed to the earth at sowing time,
so that</p>
<p>Human sacrifice, of which we have here but one of many varieties,</p>
<p>seems to have been honored at some time or another by almost every
people. On the island of Carolina in the Gulf of Mexico a great hollow
metal statue of an old Mexican deity has been found, within which still
lay the remains of human beings apparently burned to death as an
offering to the god . 133 Every one knows of the Moloch to whom the
Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, and occasionally other Semites, offered
human victims. In our own time the custom has been practised in Rhodesia
. 131 Probably it was bound up with cannibalism; men thought that the
gods had tastes like their own. As religious beliefs change more slowly
than other creeds, and rites change more slowly than beliefs, this
divine cannibalism survived after human cannibalism disappeared . 133
Slowly, however, evolving morals changed even religious rites; the gods
imitated the increasing gentleness of their worshipers, and resigned
themselves to accepting animal instead of human meat; a hind took the
place of Iphigenia, and a ram was substituted for Abraham’s son. In time
the gods did not receive even the animal; the priests liked savory food,
ate all the edible parts of the sacrificial victim themselves, and
offered upon the altar only the entrails and the bones . 133</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 6j</p>
<p>Since early man believed that he acquired the powers of whatever</p>
<p>organism he consumed, he came naturally to the conception of eating
the god. In many cases he ate the flesh and drank the blood of the human
god whom he had deified and fattened for the sacrifice. When, through
in- creased continuity in the food-supply, he became more humane, he
sub- stituted images for the victim, and was content to eat these. In
ancient Mexico an image of the god was made of grain, seeds and
vegetables, was kneaded with the blood of boys sacrificed for the
purpose, and was then consumed as a religious ceremony of eating the
god. Similar ceremonies have been found in many primitive tribes.
Usually the participant was required to fast before eating the sacred
image; and the priest turned the image into the god by the power of
magic formulas . 1 * 7</p>
<p>Magic begins in superstition, and ends in science. A wilderness of
weird beliefs came out of animism, and resulted in many strange formulas
and rites. The Kukis encouraged themselves in war by the notion that all
the enemies they slew would attend them as slaves in the after life. On
the other hand a Bantu, when he had slain his foe, shaved his own head
and anointed himself with goat-dung, to prevent the spirit of the dead
man from returning to pester him. Almost all primitive peoples believed
in the efficacy of curses, an d the destructiveness of the “evil eye .”
1 * 8 Australian natives were sure that the curse of a potent magician
could kill at a hundred miles. The belief in witchcraft began early in
human history, and has never quite disappeared. Fetishism* — the worship
of idols or other objects as having magic power — is still more ancient
and indestructible. Since many amulets are limited to a special power,
some peoples are heavily laden with a variety of them, so that they may
be ready for any emerg- ency . 130 Relics are a later and contemporary
example of fetishes possessing magic powers; half the population of
Europe wear some pendant or amulet which gives them supernatural
protection or aid. At every step the history of civilization teaches us
how slight and superficial a structure civilization is, and how
precariously it is poised upon the apex of a never-extinct volcano of
poor and oppressed barbarism, superstition and ignorance. Modernity is a
cap superimposed upon the Middle Ages, which always remain.</p>

<p>aid and comfort, and consoles himself by observing that just as
animism generates poetry, so magic begets drama and science. Frazer has
shown, with the exaggeration natural to a brilliant innovator, that the
glories of science have their roots in the absurdities of magic. For
since magic often failed, it became of advantage to the magician to
discover natural opera- tions by which he might help supernatural forces
to produce the desired event. Slowly the natural means came to
predominate, even though the magician, to preserve his standing with the
people, concealed these natural means as well as he could, and gave the
credit to supernatural magic- much as our own people often credit
natural cures to magical prescriptions and pills. In this way magic gave
birth to the physician, the chemist, the metallurgist, and the
astronomer. 1 “</p>
<p>More immediately, however, magic made the priest. Gradually, as</p>
<p>religious rites became more numerous and complex, they outgrew the
knowledge and competence of the ordinary man, and generated a special
class which gave most of its time to the functions and ceremonies of re-
ligion. The priest as magician had access, through trance, inspiration
or esoteric prayer, to the will of the spirits or gods, and could change
that will for human purposes. Since such knowledge and skill seemed to
primi- tive men the most valuable of all, and supernatural forces were
conceived to affect man’s fate at every turn, the power of the clergy
became as great as that of the state; and from the latest societies to
modern times the priest has vied and alternated with the warrior in
dominating and dis- ciplining men. Let Egypt, Judea and medieval Europe
suffice as instances.</p>
<p>The priest did not create religion, he merely used it, as a statesman
uses the impulses and customs of mankind; religion arises not out of
sacerdotal invention or chicanery, but out of the persistent wonder,
fear, insecurity, hopefulness and loneliness of men. The priest did harm
by tolerating superstition and monopolizing certain forms of knowledge;
but he limited and often discouraged superstition, he gave the people
the rudiments of education, he acted as a repository’ and vehicle for
the growing cultural heritage of the race, he consoled the weak in their
inevitable exploitation by the strong, and he became the agent through
which religion nourished art and propped up with supernatural aid the
precarious structure of human morality. If he had not existed the people
would have invented him.</p>

<li>The Moral Function of Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>Religion and government — Tabu — Sexual tabus — The lag of</p>
<p>religion — Secularization</p>
<p>Religion supports morality by two means chiefly: myth and tabu Myth
creates the supernatural creed through which celestial sanctions may be
given to forms of conduct socially (or sacerdotally) desirable; heavenly
hopes and terrors inspire the individual to put up with restraints
placed upon him by his masters and his group. Man is not naturally
obedient, gentle, or chaste; and next to that ancient compulsion which
finally gen- erates conscience, nothing so quietly and continuously
conduces to these uncongenial virtues as the fear of the gods. The
institutions of property and marriage rest in some measure upon
religious sanctions, and tend to lose their vigor in ages of unbelief.
Government itself, which is the most unnatural and necessary of social
mechanisms, has usually required the support of piety and the priest, as
clever heretics like Napoleon and Mussolini soon discovered; and hence
“a tendency to theoc racy is inci- dental to all constitutions.” 1 “ The
power of the primitive chief is increased by the aid of magic and
sorcery; and even our own government derives some sanctity from its
annual recognition of the Pilgrims’ God.</p>
<p>The Polynesians gave the word tabu to prohibitions sanctioned by re-
ligion. In the more highly developed of primitive societies such tabus
took the place of what under civilization became laws. Their form was
usually negative: certain acts and objects were declared “sacred” or “un
- clean”; and the two words meant in effect one warning: untouchable. So
the Ark of the Covenant was tabu, and Uzzah was struck dead, we are
told, for touching it to save it from falling. 1 “ Diodorus would have
us believe that the ancient Egyptians ate one another in famine, rather
than violate the tabu against eating the animal totem of the tribe. 1 “
In most primitive societies countless things were tabu; certain words
and names were never to be pronounced, and certain days and seasons were
tabu in the sense that work was forbidden at such times. All the
knowledge, and some of the ignorance, of primitive men about food were
expressed in dietetic tabus; and hygiene was inculcated by religion
rather than by science or secular medicine.</p>
<p>The favorite object of primitive tabu was woman. A thousand

<p>stitions made her, every now and then, untouchable, perilous, and “un

for they agreed that woman was the root of all evil; this was a view</p>
<p>sacred not only to Hebraic and Christian tradition, but to a hundred
pagan mythologies. The strictest of primitive tabus was laid upon the
men- struating woman; any man or thing that touched her at such times
lost virtue or usefulness . 144 The Macusi of British Guiana forbade
women to bathe at their periods lest they should poison the waters; and
they forbade them to go into the forests on these occasions, lest they
be bitten by enamored snakes. 1 “ Even childbirth was unclean, and after
it the mother was to purify herself with laborious religious rites.
Sexual relations, in most primitive peoples, were tabu not only in the
menstrual period but whenever the woman was pregnant or nursing.
Probably these prohibi- tions were originated by women themselves, out
of their own good sense and for their own protection and convenience;
but origins are easily forgotten, and soon woman found herself “impure”
and “unclean.” In the end she acce pted man’s point of view, and felt
shame in her periods, even in her pregnancy. Out of such tabus as a
partial source came modesty, the sense of sin, the view of sex as
unclean, asceticism, priestly celibacy, and the subjection of woman.</p>
<p>Religion is not the basis of morals, but an aid to them; conceivably
they could exist without it, and not infrequently they have progressed
against its indifference or its obstinate resistance. In the earliest
societies, and in some later ones, morals appear at times to be quite
independent of religion; religion then concerns itself not with the
ethics of conduct but with magic, ritual and sacrifice, and the good man
is defined in terms of ceremonies dutifully performed and faithfully
financed. As a rule religion sanctions not any absolute good (since
there is none), but those norms of conduct which have established
themselves by force of economic and social cir- cumstance; like law it
looks to the past for its judgments, and is apt to be left behind as
conditions change and morals alter with them. So the Greeks learned to
abhor incest while their mythologies still honored incestuous gods; the
Christians practised monogamy while their Bible legalized polyg- amy;
slavery was abolished while dominies sanctified it with unimpeach- able
Biblical authority; and in our own day the Church fights heroically for
a moral code that the Industrial Revolution has obviously doomed. In the
end terrestrial forces prevail; morals slowly adjust themselves to</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) MORAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 71</p>
<p>economic invention, and religion reluctantly adjusts itself to moral
change.* The moral function of religion is to conserve established
values, rather than to create new ones.</p>
<p>Hence a certain tension between religion and society marks the higher
stages of every civilization. Religion begins by offering magical aid to
harassed and bewildered men; it culminates by giving to a people that
unity of morals and belief which seems so favorable to statesmanship and
art; it ends by fighting suicidally in the lost cause of the past. For
as knowledge grows or alters continually, it clashes with mythology and
theology, which change with geological leisureliness. Priestly control
of arts and letters is then felt as a galling shackle or hateful
barrier, and intellectual history takes on the character of a “conflict
between science and religion.” In - stitutions which were at first in
the hands of the clergy, like law and punishment, education and morals,
marriage and divorce, tend to escape from ecclesiastical control, and
become secular, perhaps profane. The intellectual classes abandon the
ancient theology and — after some hesita- tion — the moral code allied
with it; literature and philosophy become anti- clerical. The movement
of liberation rises to an exuberant worship of reason, and falls to a
paralyzing disillusionment with every dogma and every idea. Conduct,
deprived of its religious supports, deteriorates into epicurean chaos;
and life itself, shorn of consoling faith, becomes a burden alike to
conscious poverty and to weary wealth. In the end a society and its
religion tend to fall together, like body and soul, in a harmonious
death. Meanwhile among the oppressed another myth arises, gives new form
to human hope, new courage to human effort, and after centuries of chaos
builds another civilization.</p>
