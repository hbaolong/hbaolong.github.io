<h4 id="chapter-vi-rousseau-romantic">CHAPTER VI Rousseau Romantic</h4>
<p>1756-62</p>
<p>I. IN THE HERMITAGE: 1 756-57</p>
<p>R OUSSEAU had moved into Mme. d’Ejpinay’s cottage on April 9, 1756,
along with his common-law wife Therese Levasseur and her mother. For a
while he was happy, loving the song and chatter of the birds, the
rustling and fragrance of the trees, the peace of solitary walks in the
woods. On his walks he carried pencil and notebook to catch ideas in
their flight.</p>
<p>But he was not made for peace. His sensitivity doubled every trouble,
and invented more. Therese was a faithful housewife, but she could not
be a companion for his mind. “The man who thinks,” he wrote in Smile,
“should not ally himself with a wife who cannot share his thoughts.” 1
Poor Therese had small use for ideas, and little for written words. She
gave him her body and soul; she bore with his tantrums, and probably
replied in kind; she al- lowed him to skirt the edge of adultery with
Mme. d’Houdetot, and was herself, so far as we know, humbly faithful
except for an episode vouched for only by Boswell. But how could this
simple woman respond to the range and wild diversity of a mind that was
to unsettle half the Continent? Hear Rousseau’s own explanation:</p>
<p>What will the reader think when I tell him… that from the first
moment in which I saw her, until that wherein I write, I have never felt
the least love for her, that I never desired to possess her,… and that
the physical wants which were satisfied with her person were to me
solely those of the sex, and by no means proceeded from the individual?…
The first of my wants, the greatest, strongest, and most insatiable, was
wholly in my heart: the want of an intimate [spiritual] connection, as
intimate as it could possibly be. This singular want was such that the
closest corporal union was not sufficient; two souls would have been
necessary. 2</p>
<p>Therandandandandse might have made countercomplaints, for Rousseau
had by this time ceased to perform his conjugal duties. In 1754 he had
stated to a Geneva physician: “I have been subject for a long time to
the crudest suf - ferings, owing to the incurable disorder of retention
of the urine, caused by a congestion in the urethra, which blocks the
canal to such an extent that even the catheters of the famed Dr. Daran
cannot be introduced there.” 3 He claimed to have ceased all sexual
intercourse with Therese after 1755. 4 “Until then,” he added, “I had
been good; from that moment I became virtuous, or at least infatuated
with virtue.”</p>
<p>The presence of his mother-in-law made the triangle painfully acute.
He</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC 1 5 3</p>
<p>maintained her and his wife as well as he could with the income from
his copying of music and the sale of his writings. However, Mme.
L^vasseur had other daughters, who required marriage portions, and were
always in need. Grimm, Diderot, and d’Holbach made up, for the two
women, an annuity of four hundred livres, pledging them to hide this
from Rousseau lest his pride be hurt. The mother (according to Rousseau
5 ) kept most of the money for herself and her other daughters, and
contracted debts in Therese’s name. Therese paid these debts, and long
concealed the annuity; finally Rousseau found it out, and flared into
anger at his friends for so humiliating him. They fed his wrath by
urging him to move from the Hermitage before the winter set in; the
cottage (they argued) was not adapted for cold weather; and even if his
wife could bear it, would the mother survive? Diderot, in his play Le
Fils naturel , 6 had written: “The good man lives in society; only the
bad man lives alone.” Rousseau took this as applying to himself; now
began a long quarrel in which reconciliations were only armis- tices.
Rousseau felt that Grimm and Diderot, envious of the peace he had found
in the woods, were trying to lure him back to a corrupt city. In a
letter to his benefactress, Mme. d’fipinay (then in Paris), he revealed
his character with candor and insight:</p>
<p>I want my friends to be my friends and not my masters; to advise me
but not to try to rule me; to have every claim upon my heart but none
upon my liberty. I consider it extraordinary the way people interfere,
in friendship’s name, in my affairs, without telling me of theirs….
Their great eagerness to do me a thousand services wearies me; there is
a touch of patronage about it that wearies me; besides, anyone else
could do as much….</p>
<p>As a recluse, I am more sensitive than other men. Suppose I fall out
with one who lives amid the throng; he thinks of the matter for a
moment, then a hundred and one distractions will make him forget it for
the rest of the day. But nothing takes my thoughts off it. Sleepless, I
think of it all night long; walking by myself, I think of it from
sunrise to sunset. My heart has not an instant’s respite, and a friend’s
unkindness will cause me to suffer, in a single day, years of grief. As
an invalid I have a right to the indulgence due from his fellow men to
the little weaknesses and temper of a sick man…. I am poor, and my
poverty (or so it seems to me) entitles me to some considera- tion….</p>
<p>So do not be surprised if I hate Paris yet more and more. Nothing for
me, from Paris, except your letters. Never shall I be seen there again.
If you care to state your views on this subject, and as vigorously as
you like, you have a right to do so. They will be taken in good part,
and will be — useless. 7</p>
<p>She answered him vi gorously enough: “Oh, leave these petty
complaints to the empty-hearted and empty- headed!” 8 Meanwhile she made
frequent inquiries about his health and comfort, shopped for him, and
sent him small gifts.</p>
<p>One day, when it froze to an extreme degree, in opening a packet of
several things I had asked her to buy for me, I found a little
under-petticoat of English flannel, which she told me she had worn, and
desired I should make of it an under-waistcoat. This more than friendly
care appeared to me so tender — as if she had stripped herself to clothe
me — that in my emotion I repeatedly kissed both the note and the
petticoat, while shedding tears. Therese thought me mad. 9</p>
<p>*54</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>During his first year at the Hermitage he compiled a Dictionnaire de
musique , and summarized in his own language the twenty-three volumes of
the Abbe de Saint-Pierre on war and peace, education, and political
reform. In the summer of 1756 he received from the author a copy of
Voltaire’s poem on the earthquake that had killed fifteen thousand
persons, and wounded fifteen thousand more, at Lisbon on All Saints’
Day, November 1, 1 755. Voltaire, like half the world, wondered why a
presumably beneficent Providence had chosen for this indiscriminate
slaughter the capital of a country completely Catholic, and an hour —
9:40 a.m. — when all pious people were worshiping in church. In a mood
of utter pessimism Voltaire painted a picture of life and nature as
being heartlessly neutral between evil and good. A passage in the
Confessions gives us Rousseau’s reaction to this powerful poem.</p>
<p>Struck by seeing this poor man, overwhelmed (if I may so speak) with
prosperity and honor, bitterly exclaiming against the miseries of this
life, and finding everything to be wrong, I formed the mad project of
making him turn his attention to himself, and of proving to him that
everything was right. Voltaire, while he appeared to believe in God,
never really believed in any- thing but the Devil, since his pretended
deity is a malicious being who, according to him, has no pleasure but in
evil. The glaring absurdity of this doctrine is particularly disgusting
from a man enjoying the greatest prosperity, who, from the bosom of
happiness, endeavors, by the frightful and cruel image of all the
calamities from which he is exempt, to reduce his fellow creatures to
despair. I, who had a better right than he to calculate and weigh all
the evils of human life, impartially examined them, and proved to him
that of all possible evils there was not one to be attributed to
Providence, and which had [not] its source rather in the abusive use man
made of his faculties than in nature. 10</p>
<p>So, on August 18, 1756, Rousseau sent to Voltaire a twenty-five-page
“Lettre sur la Providence.” It began with a handsome acknowledgment:</p>
<p>Your latest poems, monsieur, have come to me in my solitude; and
though all my friends know the love I have for your writings, I do not
know who could have sent me this book unless it be yourself. I have
found in it both pleasure and instruction, and have recognized the hand
of the master;… I am bound to thank you at once for the volume and for
your work. 11</p>
<p>He urged Voltaire not to blame Providence for the misfortunes of
mankind. Most evils are due to our own folly, sin, or crime.</p>
<p>Note that Nature did not assemble twenty thousand houses of six or
seven stories, and that if the inhabitants of that great city had been
more evenly dis- persed and more lightly lodged, the damage would have
been much less, per- haps nothing. All would have fled at the first
tremor, and we should have seen them, on the morrow, twenty leagues
away, as gay as if nothing had happened. 12</p>
<p>Voltaire had written that few persons would want to be reborn to the
same conditions; Rousseau replied that this is true only of rich people
surfeited with pleasures, bored with life, and shorn of faith; or of
literary men seden- tary, unhealthy, reflective, and discontent; it is
not true of simple people like the French middle class or the Swiss
villagers. It is only an abuse of life</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>hat makes life a problem to us. 13 Moreover, the evil of the part may
be the good of the whole; the death of the individual makes possible the
rejuvenated life of the species. Providence is universal, not
particular: it watches over the whole, but leaves specific events to
secondary causes and natural laws. 14 Early death, such as came to
Lisbon’s children, may be a boon; in any case it is unimportant if there
is a God, since He will recompense all for un- merited suffering. 15 And
the question of Go d’s existence is beyond solution by reason. We may
choose between belief and unbelief; and why reject an inspiring and
consolatory faith? As for himself, “I have suffered too much in this
fife not to hope for another. All the subtleties of metaphysics will not
make me doubt for a moment a beneficent Providence and the immortality
of the soul. I feel this, I believe it, I wish it;… I will defend these
beliefs to my last breath.” 16</p>
<p>The letter ended amiably: Rousseau expressed his agreement with
Voltaire on religious toleration, and assured him, “I would rather be a
Christian after your fashion than in the style of the Sorbonne.” 17 He
begged Voltaire to compose, with all the force and charm of his verse, a
“catechism for the citizen,” which wou ld inculcate a code of morals to
guide men through the confusion of the age. — Voltaire wrote a polite
acknowledgment, and invited Rousseau to be his guest at Les Delices. 18
He made no formal attempt to refute Rousseau’s arguments, but replied to
them indirectly with Candide (i759)-</p>

<li>IN LOVE</li>
</ol>
<p>The winter of 1756-57 was heavy with events for Rousseau. At some
time during those months he began to write the most famous novel of the
eight- eenth century: Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heloise. He conceived it
first as a study in friendship and love: cousins Julie and Claire both
love Saint-Preux, but when he seduces Julie Claire remains the loyal
friend of both. Ashamed to write merely a romance, Rousseau proposed to
raise the story to philosophy by having Julie become religious, and live
in exemplary monogamy with Wolmar, a gentleman agnostic who has
succumbed to Voltaire and Diderot. According to Rousseau’s Confessions
:</p>
<p>The storm brought on by the Encyclopedic… was at this time at its
height. Two parties, exasperated against each other to the last degree
of fury, soon resembled enraged wolves… rather than Christians and
philosophers who had a reciprocal wish to enlighten and convince each
other and lead their brethren to the way of truth…. Being by nature an
enemy to all spirit of party, I had freely spoken severe truths to each,
but they had not listened. I thought of another expedient, which in my
simplicity appeared to be ad- mirable: this was to abate their mutual
hatred by destroying their prejudices, and showing to each party the
virtue and merit which in the other deserved public esteem and respect.
This project… had the success that was to be expected: it drew together
and united the rival parties for no other purpose than that of crushing
the author…. Satisfied with… my plan, I returned to the situations in
detail,… and there resulted Parts I and II of Heloise. 19</p>
<p>i 5 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Every evening, by the fireside, he read some pages to Therese and
Mine. Levasseur. Encouraged by the tears Therese shed, he submitted the
manu- script to Mme. d’Epinay when she returned to her chateau, La
Chevrette , a mile from the Hermitage. Her memoirs recall: “On our
arrival here… we found Rousseau awaiting us. He was calm, and in the
best temper in the world. He brought me an installment of a romance
which he has commenced…. He returned to the Hermitage yesterday in order
to continue this work, which he says constituted the happiness of his
life.” 20 Soon afterward she wrote to Grimm:</p>
<p>After dinner we read Rousseau’s manuscript. I do not know whether I
am ill-disposed, but I am not satisfied with it. It is wonderfully well
written, but it is too elaborate, and seems to be unreal and wanting in
warmth. The characters do not say a word of what they ought to say; it
is always the author who speaks. I do not know how to get out of it. I
should not like to deceive Rous- seau, and I cannot make up my mind to
grieve him. 21</p>
<p>Somehow, during that winter, Rousseau poured warmth into Julie. Was
it because a living romance had come into his life? About January 30,
1757, he was visited by a lady whom he had met in Paris as the
sister-in-law of Mme. d’Epinay. Elisabeth - Sophie de Bellegarde had
married Comte d’Hou - detot, had left him, and had now for several years
been the mistress of the Marquis de Saint-Lambert — once the rival of
Voltaire for Mme. du Chatelet. Both her husband and her lover were off
to the war. In the summer of 1756 the Comtesse had leased the Chateau of
Eaubonne, some two and a half miles from the Hermitage. Saint-Lambert
wrote to her that Rousseau was within riding distance of her, and
suggested that she might mitigate her soli- tude by visiting the famous
author who had put all civilization on the defen- sive. She went in a
coach; when this stuck in the mire she continued on foot, and arrived
with her shoes and her dress soiled with mud. “She made the place
resound with laughter, in which I most heartily joined.” 22 Therese gave
her a change of clothing, and the Marquise stayed for “a rustic
collation.” She was twenty-seven, Rousseau was forty-five. She had no
special beauty of face or form, but her kindliness, good temper, and gay
spirit brightened his somber life. The next afternoon she sent him a
pretty letter, addressing him by the title he had taken after his
repatriation in Geneva:</p>
<p>My dear Citizen, I return the garments which you were kind enough to
lend me. In leaving I found a much better road, and I must tell you of
my joy over that, because it makes it much more possible to see you
again. I am sorry to have seen so little of you…. I would be less sorry
if I were more free, and always sure of not disturbing you. Farewell, my
dear Citizen, and I beg you to thank Mile. Levasseur for all the
kindness she showed me. 23</p>
<p>A few days later Saint-Lambert returned from the front. In April he
was recalled to service, and soon afterward the sprightly Comtesse
pranced to the Hermitage on horseback, dressed like a man. Rousseau was
shocked by the costume, but was soon conscious that it contained a
charming woman. Leaving Therese to her housewifely chores, he and his
guest walked out into the woods, and Mme. d’Houdetot told him how
passionately she loved Saint -</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Lambert. In May he returned her visit, going to Eaubonne at a time
when, she had told him, she would be “quite alone.” “In my frequent
excursions to Eaubonne,” he says, “I sometimes slept there…. I saw her
almost every day during three months…. I saw my Julie in Mme. d
’Houdetot, and I soon saw nothing but Mme. d’Houdetot [in Julie], but
with all the perfec - tions with which I had adorned the idol of my
heart.” 24</p>
<p>For a time he so abandoned himself to “my delirium” that he ceased to
work on his novel; instead he composed love letters, which he took care
that she should find in the niches of Eaubonne’s trees. He told her that
he was in love, not saying with whom; of course she knew. She reproved
him, and protested that she belonged body and soul to Saint-Lambert, but
she allowed his visits and ardent attentions to continue; after all, a
woman exists only when she is loved, and doubly so when loved by two.
“She refused me noth - ing that the most tender friendship could grant;
yet she granted me nothing that rendered her unfaithful.” He tells of
their “long and frequent conversa - tions… during the four months we
passed together in an intimacy almost without example between two
friends of different sexes who contain them- selves within the bounds
which we never exceeded.” 25 In his account of this liaison we find the
Romantic movement in full swing: nothing in his novel could rival these
ecstasies:</p>
<p>We were both intoxicated with the passion — she for her lover, I for
her; our sighs and delicious tears were mingled together…. Amid this
delicious in- toxication she never forgot herself for a moment, and I
solemnly protest that if ever, led away by my senses, I have attempted
to render her unfaithful, I was never really desirous of succeeding….
The duty of self-denial had elevated my mind…. I might have committed
the crime; it had been a hundred times committed in my heart; but to
dishonor my Sophie! Ah, was ever this possible? No! I have told her a
hundred times it was not…. I loved her too well to possess her…. Such
was the sole enjoyment of a man of the most combust- ible constitution,
but who was, at the same time, perhaps one of the most timid mortals
Nature ever produced. 26</p>
<p>Mme. d’fipinay noticed that her “bear” rarely came to see her now,
and she soon learned of his trips to her sister-in- law. She was hurt.
“It is hard, after all,” she wrote to Grimm in June, “that a philosopher
should escape from you at the moment when you least expect it.” 27 One
day at Eaubonne Rousseau found “Sophie” in tears. Saint -Lambert had
been informed of her flirtation, and (as she put it to Jean- Jacques)
“ill informed of it. He does me justice, but he is vexed…. I am much
afraid that your follies will cost me the repose of the rest of my
days.” 28 They agreed that it must have been Mme. d’fipinay who had told
the secret to Saint - Lambert, for “we both knew that she corresponded
with him.” Or she might have revealed it to Grimm, who occasionally saw
Saint-Lambert in Westphalia. If we may accept Rousseau’s account, Mme.
d’fipinay tried to secure from Therese the letters he had received from
Mme. d’Houdetot. In a wild letter to his hostess he accused her of
betraying him:</p>
<p>Two lovers [Sophie and Saint-Lambert], closely united and worthy of
each other’s love, are dear to me…. 1 presume that attempts have been
made to</p>
<p>i 5 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>disunite them, and that I have been made use of to inspire one of the
two with jealousy. The choice was not judicious, but it appeared
convenient to the pur- poses of malice; and of this malice it is you
whom I suspect to be guilty…. Thus the woman whom I most esteem would…
have been loaded with the infamy of dividing her heart and her person
between two lovers, and I with that of being one of these wretches. If I
knew that but for a single moment in your life you ever had thought
this, either of her or of myself, I should hate you until my last hour.
But it is with having said, and not [merely] with having thought it,
that I charge you.</p>
<p>Do you know in what manner I will make amends for my faults during
the short space of time I have to remain near you? By doing what nobody
but myself would do: by telling you freely what the world thinks of you,
and the breaches that you have to repair in your reputation. 29</p>
<p>Mme. d’fipinay, guilty or not (we do not know), was distressed by the
violence of these accusations. She reported them to her distant lover
Grimm. He replied that he had warned her against the “devilish scrapes”
she would be involved in by letting the moody and incalculable Rousseau
into the Hermitage. 80 She invited Jean-Jacques to La Chevrette; she
greeted him with an embrace and tears; he responded tear for tear; she
gave him no explana- tion that we know of; he dined with her, slept in
her house, and departed the next morning with expressions of
friendship.</p>
<p>Diderot complicated the mess. He advised Rousseau to write to Saint-
Lambert confessing his tenderness for Sophie, but assuring him of her
fidel- ity. Rousseau (according to Diderot) promised to do so. But Mme.
d’Houde - tot begged him not to write, and to let her extricate herself
in her own way from the difficulties in which his infatuation and her
dalliance had placed her. When Saint-Lambert returned from the front
Diderot spoke to him of the affair, assuming that Rousseau had confessed
it. Rousseau reproached Diderot with betraying him; Diderot reproached
Rousseau for deceiving him. Only Saint-Lambert behaved philosophically.
He came with Sophie to the Hermitage; he “invited himself to dinner with
me,… treated me severely but in a friendly manner,” and inflicted no
worse punishment than to sleep and snore while Jean-Jacques read aloud
his long letter to Voltaire. Mme. d’Houdetot, however, discouraged any
further meetings with Rous- seau. At her request he returned the letters
she had written him, but when he asked for those that he had written to
her she said she had burned them. “Of this,” he tells us, “I dared to
doubt,… and doubt still. No such letters as mine to her were ever thrown
into the fire. Those of Helo’ise [to Abe- lard] have been found ardent;
good heavens! what would have been said of these?” 31 Wounded and
ashamed, he retired into his imaginary world; he resumed the writing of
La Nouvelle Helo’ise, and pourdd into it the passions of his letters to
Mme. d’Houdetot.</p>
<p>New humiliations awaited him when Grimm returned from the war</p>
<p>(September, 1757). “I could scarcely recognize the same Grimm who”
for - merly had “thought himself honored when I cast my eyes upon him.”
32 Rousseau could not understand Grimm’s coldness to him; he did not
know that Grimm knew of the insulting letter to Mme. d’Epinay. Grimm was
al - most as self-centered as Jean-Jacques, but was otherwise antipodal
to him</p>

<li>MUCH ADO</li>
</ol>
<p>A new crisis developed when, in October, 1757, Mme. d’fipinay decided
to visit Geneva. This is Rousseau’s story:</p>
<p>“My friend,” she said to me, “I am immediately going to set out for
Geneva; my chest is in a bad state, and my health so deranged, that I
must go and consult Tronchin.” I was the more astonished at this
resolution so suddenly taken, and at the beginning of the bad season of
the year…. I asked her whom she would take with her. She said her son
and [his tutor] M. de Linant; and then she carelessly added: “And you,
dear, will not you go also?” As I did not think she spoke seriously,
knowing that at this season I was scarcely able to go to my chamber
[i.e., to travel between La Chevrette and the Hermitage], I joked upon
the utility of one sick person to another. She herself had not seemed to
make the proposition seriously, and there the matter dropped. 34</p>
<p>He had excellent reasons for not wishing to accompany Madame; his
ail- ments forbade it, and how could he leave Therese? Moreover, gossip
whis- pered that his hostess was pregnant, presumably by Grimm; Rousseau
for a time believed the tale, and complimented himself on escaping from
a ridic- ulous situation. The poor woman was telling the truth: she was
suffering from tuberculosis; she seems to have sincerely desired
Rousseau to accom- pany her; and why should he not be glad to revisit,
at her expense, the city of which he was so proudly Citoyen? Aware of
her feelings, Diderot wrote to Rousseau urging him to take her request
seriously and accede to it, if only as some return for her benefactions.
He replied in his characteristic style:</p>
<p>I perceive that the opinion you give comes not from yourself. Besides
my being but little disposed to suffer myself to be led by the nose
under your name by any third or fourth person, I observe in this
secondary advice a certain underhand dealing which ill agrees with your
candor, and from which you will, on your account as well as mine, do
well in future to abstain. 35</p>
<p>On October 22 he took Diderot’s letter and his own reply to La
Chevrette</p>
<p>Tell me, Grimm, why do all my friends declare that I ought to
accompany Mme. d’Epinay? Am I wrong, or are they all bewitched?… Mme.
d’Epinay starts in a nice postchais e, accompanied by her husband, her
son’s tutor, and five or six servants…. Should I be able to endure a
postchaise? Can I hope to accomplish so long a journey so speedily
without a mishap? Shall I have it stopped every moment that I may get
down, or shall I accelerate my torments and my last hours by being
obliged to put restraint upon myself?… My devoted friends… [seem] intent
upon worrying me to death. 37</p>
<p>l6o ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. VI</p>
<p>On October 30 Mme. d’£pinay left Paris for Geneva. On November 5
Grimm (according to the Memoirs) replied to Rousseau:</p>
<p>I have done my utmost to avoid replying definitely to the horrible
apology which you have addressed to me. You press me to do so…. I never
thought that you ought to have accompanied Mme. d’Epinay to Geneva. Even
if your first impulse had been to offer her your company, it would have
been her duty to refuse your offer, and to remind you of what you owe to
your position, your health, and the women whom you have dragged into
your retreat; that is my opinion….</p>
<p>You dare to speak to me of your slavery, to me who, for more than two
years, have been the daily witness of all the proofs of the most tender
and generous friendship which this woman has given you. If I were able
to pardon you, I should think myself unworthy to have a friend. I will
never see you again in my life, and I shall think myself happy if I can
banish from my mind the memory of your behavior. I ask you to forget me,
and not to disturb me any more. 38</p>
<p>From Geneva Mme. d’£pinay wrote to Grimm: “I have received the</p>
<p>hanks of the Republic for the way in which I have treated Rousseau,
and a formal deputation of watchmakers on the same subject. The people
here hold me in veneration on his account.” 39 Tronchin warned her that
she would have to remain under his care for a year. She was a frequent
visitor at Vol- taire’s homes in Geneva and Lausanne. After some delay
Grimm joined her, and they had eight months of happiness.*</p>
<p>On November 23, 1757, Rousseau (he tells us) wrote to her as
follows:</p>
<p>Were it possible to die of grief I should not now be alive….
Friendship, madame, is extinguished between us, but that which no longer
exists still has its rights, and I respect them. I have not forgotten
your goodness to me, and you may expect from me as much gratitude as it
is possible to have toward a person I can no longer love….</p>
<p>I wished to quit the Hermitage, and I ought to have done it. My
friends pre- tend I must stay there till spring; and since my friends
desire it I will remain there till then if you will consent. 40</p>
<p>Early in December Diderot came to see Rousseau, and found him in
wrath and tears at the “tyranny” which his friends exercised over him.
Diderot’s report of this visit appears in his letter of December 5 to
Grimm:</p>
<p>The man is a madman ( forcene ). I have seen him; I reproached him,
with all the force given me by honesty, for the enormity of his conduct.
He put into his defense of himself an angry passion which afflicted me….
This man comes between me and my work, and troubles my mind; it is as
though I had one of the damned near me…. Oh, what a spectacle it is —
that of a wicked and ferocious man! Let me never see him again; he would
make me believe in devils and hell. 41</p>
<p>Rousseau received an answer from Mme. d’£pinay on December 10. Ap -
parently Grimm had told her of Rousseau’s comments on his “slavery” at
the Hermitage, for she wrote with unusual bitterness:</p>
<ul>
<li>They returned to Paris in October, 1759; her home there became one
of the minor salons. Her book on education was crowned by the
Academy.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>After having for several years given you every possible mark of
friendship, all I can now do is to pity you. You are very unhappy….</p>
<p>Since you are determined to quit the Hermitage, and are persuaded
that you ought to, I am astonished that your friends have prevailed upon
you to stay there. For my part I never consult mine on my duty, and I
have nothing further to say to you on your own. 42</p>
<p>On December 15, though winter was closing in, Rousseau left the
Hermi- tage with Therese and all their belongings. Her mother he sent to
live in Paris with the other daughters, but he promised to contribute to
her support. He moved to a cottage in Montmorency, leased to him by an
agent of Louis- Frangois de Bourbon, Prince de Conti. There, turning his
back upon his former friends, he produced in five years three of the
most influential books of the century.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE BREAK WITH THE PH 1 LOSOPHES</li>
</ol>
<p>His new home was in what he called the jar din de Mont- Louis; a
“single chamber” fronted with a lawn, and, at the end of the garden, an
old tower</p>
<p>We should note, in passing, how many aristocrats helped the rebels of
the Enlightenment, not so much through agreement with their views as
through generous sympathy with genius in need. There were many elements
of nobility in the nobles of the Old Regime. And Rousseau, who denounced
the aristocracy, was especially befriended by it. Sometimes the proud
artisan forgot himself, and boasted of his titled friends. Speaking of
his lawn he wrote:</p>
<p>That terrace was my drawing room, wherein I received M. and Mme. de
Luxembourg, the Due de Villeroi, the Prince de Tingry, the Marquis
d’Armen - tieres, the Duchesse de Montmorency, the Duchesse de
Boufflers,* the Comtesse de Valentinois, the Comtesse de Boufflers, and
other persons of the same rank, who… deigned to make the pilgrimage to
Mont-Louis. 44</p>
<p>Not far from Rousseau’s cottage was the home of the Marechal and
Marechale de Luxembourg. Soon after his arrival they invited him to
dinner;</p>
<ul>
<li>In the profusion of Boufflers who entered history in the 18th
century we may distinguish (1) the Duchesse de Boufflers, who became the
Marechale de Luxembourg, (2) the Marquise de Boufflers, mistress of
Stanislas Leszczynski, and (3) the Comtesse de Boufflers, friend of
David Hume and Horace Walpole.</li>
</ul>
<p>6i</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>he refused. They repeated the invitation in the summer of 1758; he
again refused. Toward Easter of 1759 they came, with half a dozen titled
friends, to beard him in his retreat. He was frightened; the Marechale,
as Duchesse de Boufflers, had earned a reputation for charming too many
men. But she had outlived her sins, and had matured into a woman of
maternal rather than merely sexual charm; soon she thawed his shy
reserve, and aroused him into lively conversation. The visitors wondered
why a man of such parts should be living in such poverty. The Marechal
invited Rousseau and Therese to come and live with him until the cottage
could be repaired; Jean- Jacques still resisted; finally he and Therese
were persuaded to occupy for a time the “Petit Chateau” on the
Luxembourg estate. They moved into it in May,</p>
<ol start="1759" type="1">
<li>Sometimes Rousseau visited the Luxembourgs in their luxurious home;
there he was easily induced to read to them and their guests some parts
of the novel that he was completing. After a few weeks he and Therese
re- turned to their own cottage, but he continued to visit the
Luxembourgs, and they remained loyal to him through all the
perturbations of his moods. Grimm complained that Rousseau “had left his
old friends and replaced us with pe ople of the highest rank,” 45 but it
was Grimm who had rejected</li>
</ol>
<p>Sir, I have a violent aversion to the social classes that dominate
others…. I have no trouble admitting this to you, scion of illustrious
blood…. I hate the great, I hate their position, their harshness, their
prejudices,… their vices…. It was in such a frame of mind I went as one
dragged along to the chateau [of the Luxembourgs] at Montmorency. Then I
saw the masters; they loved me, and I, sir, loved them, and will love
them as long as I live…. I would give them, I will not say my life, for
that gift would be a feeble one;… but I will give them the only glory
that has ever touched my heart — the honor I expect from posterity, and
which it will certainly pay me, because this is due me, and posterity is
always just.</p>
<p>One former friend he had hoped to keep — Mme. d’Houdetot; but Saint -
Lambert reproached her for the gossip in which Paris linked her name
with Rousseau’s, and she bade Rousseau refrain from addressing letters
to her. He remembered that he had confessed his passion for her to
Diderot; now he concluded that it was Diderot who had babbled about it
in the salons, and “I resolved to break with him forever.” 48</p>
<p>He chose the worst possible moment and means. On July 27, 1758, Hel-
vetius had published, in De F Esprit, a powerful attack upon the
Catholic clergy. The resultant furor led to a rising demand for the
suppression of the Encyclopedic (then seven volumes old) and all
writings critical of Church or state. Volume VII containe d d’Alembert’s
rash article on Geneva, lauding the Calvinist clergy for their secret
Unitarianism, and pleading with the Genevan authorities to allow the
establishment of a theater. In October, 1758, Rousseau published his
Lettre a M. d’Alembert sur les spectacles. Moderate in tone, it was
nevertheless a declaration of war against the Age of Reason, against the
irreligion and immorality of mid-eighteenth-century France. In the
preface Rousseau went out of his way to repudiate Diderot,</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>without naming him: “I had an Aristarchus, severe and judicious. I
have him no more; I want no more of him; but I shall regret him
unceasingly, and my heart misses him even more than my writings.” And in
a footnote he added, believing that Diderot had betrayed him to
Saint-Lambert:</p>
<p>If you have drawn a sword against a friend, don’t despair, for there
is a way to return it to him. If you have made him unhappy by your
words, fear not, for it is possible to be reconciled with him. But for
outrage, hurtful reproach, the revelation of a secret, and the wound
done to his heart by betrayal, there is no grace in his eyes; he will go
away from you and never return. 47</p>
<p>The letter, 1 35 pages in translation, was in part a defense of
religion as pub- licly preached in Geneva. As his Smile would soon
indicate, Rousseau was himself a Unitarian — rejecting the divinity of
Christ; but in applying for Gene- van citizenship he had professed the
full Calvinist creed; in this Lettre he de- fended the orthodox faith,
and belief in a divine revelation, as indispensable aids to popular
morality. “What can be proved by reason to the majority of men is only
the interested calculation of personal benefit”; hence a merely “natural
religion” w ould let morality degenerate into nothing more than
avoidance of detection.</p>
<p>But theology was a minor issue in Rousseau’s argument; his frontal
assault was upon d’Alembert’s proposal that a theater should be
legalized in Geneva. Here the secret enemy was not d’Alembert but
Voltaire: Voltaire whose fame as a resident of Geneva irritably outshone
Rousseau’s glory as Citoyen de Geneve ; Voltaire who had dared to stage
plays in or near Geneva, and who doubtless had prompted d’Alemb ert to
insert a plea for a Genevan theater in an Ency elope die article. What?
Introduce into a city famous for its Puritan morals a form of
entertainment that had almost everywhere glori- fied immorality? Tragic
dramas nearly always pictured crime; they did not purge the passions, as
Aristotle thought; they inflamed the passions, especially of sex and
violence. Comedies seldom represented wholesome married love; often they
laughed at virtue, as even Moliere had done in Le Misanthrope. All the
world knew that actors led lawless and immoral lives, and that most of
the alluring actresses of the French stage were paragons of promiscuity,
serving as centers and sources of corruption in a society that idolized
them. Perhaps, in large cities like Paris and London, these evils of the
stage affect only a small part of the population, but in a small city
like Geneva (with only 24,000 population) the poison would spread
through all ranks, and the representations would stir up newfangled
notions and party strife. 48</p>
<p>So far Rousseau had echoed the Puritan, or Calvinist, view of the
theater; he was saying in France in 1758 what Stephen Gosson had said in
England in 1579, William Prynne in 1632, Jeremy Collier in 1698. But
Rousseau did not confine himself to denunciation. He was no Puritan; he
advocated balls and dances under public sponsorship and supervision.
There should be public amusements, but of a social and wholesome kind,
like picnics, open-air games, festivals, parades. (Here Rousseau added
an animated description of a regatta on Lake Geneva. 49 )</p>
<p>The Letter, he tells us, “had a great success.” Paris was beginning
to tire</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>of immorality; there was no further zest in unconventional deviations
that had themselves become conventional. The city was surfeited with men
who behaved like women, and women who itched to be like men. It had had
enough of classic drama and its stilted forms. It saw how poor a showing
Mme. de Pompadour’s generals and soldiers were making against
Frederick’s Spartan troops. To hear a philosopher speak well of virtue
was a refreshing experience. The moral influence of the Letter would
grow until, with Rous- seau’s other writings, it would share in
producing an almost revolutionary return to decency under Louis XVI.</p>
<p>The philosophies could not foresee this. What they felt in Rousseau’s
proc - lamation was an act of betrayal: he had attacked them in the
moment of their greatest danger. In January, 1759, the government
finally forbade the pub- lication or sale of the Encyclopedie. When
Rousseau denounced the morals of Paris his former intimates, recalling
his pursuit of Mme. d’Houdetot, con - demned him a hypocrite. When he
denounced the stage they pointed out that he had written Le Devin du
village and Narcisse for the stage, and had frequented the theater.
Saint-Lambert rejected with a harsh message (Octo- ber 10, 1758) the
copy which Rousseau had sent him of the Letter:</p>
<p>I cannot accept the present you have offered me…. You may, for aught
I know to the contrary, have reason to complain of Diderot, but this
does not give you a right to insult him publicly. You are not
unacquainted with the nature of the persecutions which he suffers…. I
cannot refrain from telling you, sir, how much this heinous act of yours
has shocked me…. You and I differ too much in our principles ever to be
agreeable to each other. Forget that I exist…. I promise to forget your
person, and to remember nothing about you but your talents. 50</p>
<p>Mme. d’fipinay, however, on her return from Geneva, thanked Rousseau
for the copy that he had directed to her, and invited him to dinner. He
went, and met Saint- Lambert and Mme. d’Houdetot for the last time.</p>
<p>From Geneva came a dozen letters of praise. Encouraged by Rousseau’s
stand, the Genevan magistrates forbade Voltaire to stage any further
theatri- cals on Genevan soil. Voltaire removed his dramatic properties
to Tourney, and transferred his residence to Femey. He felt the sting of
defeat. He branded Rousseau as a deserter and apostate, and mourned that
the little flock of philosophes had fallen into a self- consuming
strife. “The infamous Jean-Jac ques,” he wrote, “is the Judas of the
brotherhood.” 51 Rousseau re - torted in a letter (January 29, 1760) to
the Genevan pastor Paul Moultou:</p>
<p>You speak to me of that man Voltaire? Why does the name of that
buffoon sully your correspondence? That miserable fellow has ruined my
country [Geneva]. I would hate him more if I despised him less. I only
see in his great gifts something additionally shameful, which dishonors
him by the use he makes of them…. Oh, citizens of Geneva, he makes you
pay well for the refuge you have given him ! 52</p>
<p>It grieved Rousseau to learn that Voltaire was producing plays at
Tour- ney, and that many citizens of Geneva were crossing the frontiers
into France to witness these performances — some even to take part in
them. His resentment found an added casus belli when his letter to
Voltaire on the</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>j 65</p>
<p>Lisbon earthquake.was printed in a Berlin journal (1760), apparently
through Voltaire’s carel ess lending of the manuscript to a friend. Now
(June</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>Rousseau sent to Voltaire one of the most extraordinary letters in
the correspondence of this turbulent age. After reproaching Voltaire for
the unauthorized publication, he proceeded:</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t li ke you, monsieur. To me, your disciple and enthusiast, you
have done the most painful injuries. You have ruined Geneva as a reward
for the asylum that you received there. You have alienated my fellow
citizens from me as a reward for the praises I gave you among them. It
is you who make it unbearable for me to live in my own country; you who
will compel me to die on foreign soil, deprived of all the consolations
of the dying, and thrown dis- honored upon some refuse heap, while all
the honors that a man can expect will attend you in my native land. In
short, I hate you, since you have willed it so; but i. hate you with the
feelings of one still capable of loving you, if you had desired it. Of
all the feelings with which my heart was filled for you, there remains
only admiration for your fine genius, and love for your writings. If I
honor in you only your talents it is not my fault. I shall never be
found want- ing in the respect which is due them, nor in the behavior
which that respect demands. 53</p>
<p>Voltaire did not answer, but privately he called Rousseau
“charlatan,” “madman,” “little monkey,” and “miserable fool.” 54 In
correspondence with d’Alembert he showed himself quite as sensitive and
passionate as Jean- Jacques.</p>
<p>I have received a long letter from Rousseau. He has gone completely
mad…. He writes against the stage after having written a bad comedy
himself; he writes against France, which nourishes him; he finds four or
five rotten staves from the barrel of Diogenes and climbs into them in
order to bark at us; he abandons his friends. He writes to me — to me! —
the most insulting letter that a fanatic ever scrawled…. If he were not
an inconsequential poor pygmy of a man, swollen with vanity, there would
be no great harm done; but he has added to the insolence of his letter
the infamy of intriguing with Socinian pedants here in order to prevent
me from having a theater of my own at Tourney, or at least preventing
the citizens from playing there with me. If he meant by this base trick
to prepare for himself a triumphant return to the low streets whence he
sprang, it is the action of a scoundrel, and I shall never pardon him. I
would have avenged myself on Plato if he had played a trick of that sort
on me; even more on the lackey of Diogenes. The author of the Nouvelle
Aloisa is nothing but a vicious knave. 55</p>
<p>In these two letters of the two most famous writers of the eighteenth
cen- tury we see, behind the supposedly impersonal currents of the time,
the nerves that felt keenly every blow in the conflict, and the common
human vanity that throbs in the hearts of philosophers and saints.</p>
<p>V. THE NEW HELOISE</p>
<p>The book that Vol taire misnamed had been for three years Rousseau’s
refuge from his enemies, his friends, and the world. Begun in 1756, it
was finished in September, 1758, was sent to a publisher in Holland, and
appeared in February, 1761, as Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heloise , Lettres
de deux amants ,</p>
<p>1 66 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. VI</p>
<p>recueillies et publiees par J.-J. Rousseau. The letter form for a
novel was al- ready old, but was probably determined in this instance by
the example of Richardson’s Clarissa.</p>
<p>The story is improbable but unique. Julie is the daughter, seventeen
or so years old, of Baron d’fitange. Her mother invites the young and
handsome Saint-Preux to be her tutor. The new Abelard falls in love with
the new Heloi’se, as any real mother would have foreseen. Soon he is
sending his pupil love letters that set the tune for a century of
romantic fiction:</p>
<p>I tremble as often as our hands meet, and I know not how it happens,
but they meet constantly. 1 start as soon as I feel the touch of your
finger; I am seized with a fever, or rather delirium, in these sports;
my senses gradually forsake me; and when I am thus beside myself what
can I say, what can I do, where hide myself, how be answerable for my
behavior? 56</p>
<p>He proposes to go away, but lets the word do for the deed.</p>
<p>Adieu, then, too charming Julie…. Tomorrow I shall be gone forever.
But be assured that my violent spotless passion for you will end only
with my life; that my heart, full of so divine an object, will never
debase itself by ad- mitting a second impression; that it will divide
all its future homage between you and virtue; and that no other flame
shall ever profane the altar at which Julie was adored. 57</p>
<p>Julie may smile at this adoration, but she is too womanly to send so
de- lightful an acolyte from the altar. She bids him postpone his
flight. In any case the electric contact of male with female has set her
in similar agitation; soon she confesses that she too has felt the
myster ious sting: “The very first day we met I imbibed the poison which
now infects my senses and my rea- son; I felt it instantly, and thine
eyes, thy sentiments, thy discourse, thy guilty pen, daily increase its
malignity.” 58 Nevertheless he is not to ask for anything more sinful
than a kiss. “Thou shalt be virtuous, or despised; I will be
respectable, or be myself again; it is the only hope I have left that is
preferable to the hope of death.” Saint -Preux agrees to unite delirium
with virtue, but believes that this will require supernatural aid:</p>
<p>Celestial powers!… Inspire me with a soul that can bear felicity!
Divine love! spirit of my existence, oh, support me, for I am ready to
sink down under the weight of ecstasy!… Oh, how shall I withstand the
rapid torrent of bliss which overflows my heart? — and how dispel the
apprehensions of a timorously loving girl craintive amante ’]} 5 9</p>

<p>Julie’s mother, having learned of her deflowering, dies of grief. The
Baron vows to kill Saint-Preux, who thereupon begins a circumnavigation
of the globe. In remorse and in obedience to her father, Julie marries
Wolmar, a</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>Russian of high birth and considerable years. Clandestinely she
continues to correspond with Saint-Preux, and to feel for him a
sentiment stronger than her dutiful attachment to her husband. She is
surprised to find that Wolmar, though an atheist, is a good man,
faithful to her, solicitous for her comfort, just and generous to all.
In one of her letters to Saint-Preux she assures him that man and wife
can find content in a manage de convenance. But she never again knows
full happiness. Her premarital deviation weighs on her memory. Finally
she confesses to her husband that moment of sin. He has known of it, and
resolved never to mention it; he tells her it was no sin at all; and to
confirm her absolution he invites Saint-Preux to come and stay with them
as tutor of their children. Saint-Preux comes, and we are assured that
the three live together in harmony till death does them part. The in-
credible husband absents himself for several days. Julie and Saint-Preux
go boating on the Lake of Geneva; they cross to Savoy, and he shows her
the rocks upon which, in his banishment, he wrote her name; he weeps,
she holds his trembling hand, but they return sinless to her home in
Clarens, in the Pays de Vaud. 62</p>
<p>They wonder how Wolmar can be so good without religious belief.
Saint- Preux, who, like Julie, is a pious Protestant, explains the
anomaly:</p>
<p>Having resided in Roman Catholic countries, he [Wolmar] has never
been led to a better opinion of Christianity by what he found professed
there. Their religion, he saw, tended only to the interest of their
priests; it consisted entirely of ridiculous grimaces and a jargon of
words without meaning. He perceived that men of sense and probity were
unanimously of his opinion, and that they did not scruple to say so;
nay, that the clergy themselves, under the rose, ridi- culed in private
what they inculcated and taught in public; hence he has often assured us
that, after taking much time and pains in the search, he has never met
with above three priests who believed in God. 63</p>
<p>Rousseau adds, in a footnote: “God forbid that I should approve these
hard and rash assertions!” Despite them, Wolmar regularly goes to
Protestant services with Julie, out of respect for her and his
neighbors. Julie and Saint- Preux see in him “the strangest absurdity”—
a man “thinking like an infidel and acting like a Christian.” 64</p>
<p>He did not deserve the final blow. Julie, dying of a fever contracted
while saving her son from drowning, entrusts to Wolmar an unsealed
letter to Saint-Preux, which declares to Saint-Preux that he has always
been her only love. We can understand the permanence of that first
impression, but why reward her husband’s long fidelity and trust with so
cruel a deathbed rejec - tion? It is hardly consistent with the nobility
with which the author has in- vested Julie’s character.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she is one of the great portraits in modern fiction.
Though it was probably suggested by Richardson’s Clarissa, it was
inspired by Rous - seau’s own recol lections: the two girls whose horses
he had led across the stream at Annecy; the memories he treasured of
Mme. de Warens in his first years under her protection; and then Mme.
d’Houdetot, who had made him feel the overflow of love by damming his
desire. Of course Julie is none of these women, and perhaps no woman
that Rousseau had ever met, but only</p>
<p>l68 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>he composite ideal of his dreams. The picture is spoiled by Rou
sseau’s in - sistence upon making nearly all his characters talk like
Rousseau; Julie, as motherhood deepens her, becomes a sage who
discourses lengthily on every- thing from domestic economy to mystic
union with God. “We will examine into the validity of this argument,”
she says; but what lovable woman ever descended to such bathos?</p>
<p>Saint-Preux, of course, is especially Rousseau, sensitive to all the
charms of women, longing to kneel at their idealized feet, and to pour
out the eloquent phrases of devotion and passion that he has rehearsed
in his loneliness. Rous- seau describes him as “always perpetrating some
madness, and always making a start at being wise.” 85 Saint -Preux is an
unbelievable prig compared with the frankly villainous Lovelace of
Richardson. He too must mouth Rousseau: he describes Paris as a
maelstrom of evils — great wealth, great poverty, in- competent
government, bad air, bad music, trivial conversation, vain philos- ophy,
and the almost total collapse of religion, morality, and marriage; he
repeats the first Discourse on the natural goodness of man and the
corrupting and degrading influences of civilization; and he compliments
Julie and Wolmar on preferring the quiet and wholesome life of the
countryside at Clarens.</p>
<p>Wolmar is the most original character in Rousseau’s gallery. Who was
his model? Perhaps d’Holbach, the “amiable atheist,” the philosopher
baron, the virtuous materialist, the devoted husband of one wife and
then of her sister. And perhaps Saint-Lambert, who had shocked Rousseau
by preaching atheism but had forgiven him for making love to his
mistress. Rousseau candidly avows his use of living prototypes and
personal memories:</p>
<p>Full of that which had befallen me, and still affected by so many
violent emotions, my heart added the sentiment of its sufferings to the
ideas with which meditation had inspired me…. Without perceiving it I
described the situa- tion I was then in, gave portraits of Grimm, Mme.
d’Epinay, Mme. d’Houdetot, Saint-Lambert, and myself. 66</p>
<p>Through these character portraits Rousseau expounded nearly all
facets of his philosophy. He gave an ideal picture of a happy marriage,
of an agricultural estate managed with efficiency, justice, and
humanity, and of children brought up to be exemplary mixtures of freedom
and obedience, restraint and intelligence. He anticipated the arguments
of his J Smile: that education should be first of the body to health,
then of the character to a Stoic discipline, and only then of the
intellec t to reason. “The only means of rendering children docue,” says
Julie, “is not to reason with them, but to convince them that reason is
above their age”; 67 there should be no appeal to</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU ROMANTIC</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>hem to have women of their own, as to order them to satisfy
themselves with the women of other men.” 68 In passing Rousseau declares
i n favor of religious toleration, extending it even to atheists: “No
true believer will be</p>
<p>The novel had an epochal influence in arousing Europe to the beauties
and sublimities of nature. In Voltaire, Diderot, and d’Alembert the
fever of philosophy and urban life had not encouraged sensitivity to the
majesty of mountains and the kaleidoscope of the sky. Rousseau had the
advantage of being born amid the most impressive scenery in Europe. He
had walked from Geneva into Savoy, and across the Alps to Turin, and
from Turin into France; he had savored the sights and sounds and
fragrances of the country- side; he had felt every sunrise as the
triumph of divinity over evil and doubt. He imagined a mystic accord
between his moods and tbe changing temper of the earth and the air; his
ecstasy of love embraced every tree and flower, every blade of grass. He
climbed the Alps to midway of their height, and found a purity of air
that seemed to cleanse and clear his thoughts. He described these
experiences with such feeling and vividness that mountain climbing,
especially in Switzerland, became one of Europe’s major sports.</p>
<p>Never before in modern literature had feeling, passion, and romantic
love received so detailed and eloquent an exposition and defense.
Reacting against the adoration of reason from Boileau to Voltaire,
Rousseau proclaimed the primacy of feeling and its right to be heard in
the interpretation of life and the evaluation of creeds. With La
Nouvelle Heloise the Romantic movement raised its challenge to the
classic age. Of course there had been romantic moments even in the
classic heyday: Honore d’Urfe had played with bu - colic love in VAstree
(1610-27); Mile, de Scudery had stretched amours to reams in Artamene,
ou Le Grand Cyrus (1649-53); Mme. de La Fayette had married love and
death in La Princesse de Cleves (1678); Racine had brought the same
theme into Phedre (1677) — the very apex of the classic age. We recall
how Rousseau had inherited old romances from his mother, and had read
them with his father. As for the Alps, Albrecht von Haller had already
sung their majesty (1729), and James Thomson had celebrated the beauty
and terror of the seasons (1726-30). Jean-Jacques must have read
Prevost’s Manon Lescaut (1731), and (since he could read English with
difficulty) he must have been familiar with Richardson’s Clarissa (1747
-48) in Prevost’s translation. From that two -thousand-page (still
incomplete) se- duction he took the letter form of narrative as
congenial to psychological analysis; and he gave Julie a cousin
confidante in Claire as Richardson had given Clarissa Miss Howe.
Rousseau noted with resentment that Diderot published an ecstatic Lloge
de Richardson (1761) soon after Julie, dimming Julie’s glory.</p>
<p>Julie is quite equal to Clarissa in originality and faults, far
superior to it in style. Both are rich in improbabilities and heavy with
sermons. But France, which excels the world in style, had never known
the French language to take on such color, ardor, smoothness, and
rhythm. Rousseau did not merely</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>preach feeling, he had it; everything he touched was infused with
sensitivity and sentiment, and though we may smile at his raptures we
find ourselves warmed by his fire. We may resent, and hurry over, the
untimely disquisi- tions, but we read on; and every now and then a scene
intensely felt renews the life of the tale. Voltaire thought in ideas
and wrote with epigrams; Rous- seau saw in pictures and composed with
sensations. His phrases and periods were not artless; he confessed that
he turned them over in bed while the passion of the artist frightened
sleep. 70 “I must read Rousseau,” said Kant, “until his beauty of
expression no longer distracts me, and only then can I examine him with
reason.” 71</p>
<p>Julie succeeded with everyone except the philosophies. Grimm called
it “a feeble imitation” of Clarissa, and predicted that it would soon be
for - gotten. 72 “No more about Jean - Jacques’ romance, if you please,”
growled Voltaire (January 21, 1761); “I have read it, to my sorrow, and
it would be to his if I had time to say what I think of this silly
book.” 73 A month later he said it in Lettres sur La Nouvelle Helo’ise,
published under a pseudonym. He pointed out grammatical errors, and gave
no sign of appreciating Rousseau’s descriptions of nature — though he
would later imitate Jean- Jacques by climb- ing a hill to worship the
rising sun. Paris recognized Voltaire’s hand, and judged the patriarch
to be bitten with jealousy.</p>
<p>Barring these pricks, Rousseau was delighted with the reception of
his first full- length work. “In all literary history,” thought
Michelet, “there had never been so grea t a success.” 74 Edition
followed edition, but printings fell far behind demand. Lines formed at
the stores to buy the book; eager readers paid twelve sous per hour to
borrow it; those who had it during the day rented it to others for the
night. 75 Rousseau told happily how one lady, all dressed to go to a
ball at the Opera, ordered her carriage, took up Julie meanwhile, and
became so interested that she read on till four in the morn- ing while
maid and horses waited. 76 He ascribed his triumph to the pleasure women
took in reading of love; but there were also women who were tired of
being mistresses, and longed to be wives and to have fathers for their
children. Hundreds of letters reached Rousseau at Montmorency, thanking
him for his book; so many women tendered him their love that his
imagina- tion concluded: “There was not one woman in high life with whom
I</p>
<p>might not have succeeded had I undertaken to do it.” 77</p>
<p>It was something new that a man should so completely reveal himself
as Rousseau had done through Saint-Preux and Julie; and there is nothing
so interesting as a human soul, even partly or unconsciously bared to
view. Here, said Mme. de Stael, “all the veils of the heart have been
rent.” 78 Now began the reign of subjective literature, a long
succession, lasting to our own days, of self - revelations, of hearts
broken in print, of “beautiful souls” pub - licly bathing in tragedy. To
be emotional, to express emotion and sentiment, became a fashion not
only in France but in England and Germany. The classic mode of
restraint, order, reason, and form began to fade away; the reign of the
philosophes neared its end. After 1760 the eighteenth century belonged
to Rousseau. 79</p>
