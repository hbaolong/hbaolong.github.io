<h4 id="chapter-xiii">CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<p>The Morals and Manners</p>
<p>of the Athenians</p>
<p>I. CHILDHOOD</p>
<p>E very Athenian citizen is expected to have children, and all the
forces of religion, property, and the state unite to discountenance
childlessness. Where no offspring comes, adoption is the rule, and high
prices are paid for prepossessing orphans. At the same time law and
public opinion accept infanti- cide as a legitimate safeguard against
excess population and a pauperizing frag- mentation of the land; any
father may expose a newborn child to death either as doubtfully his, or
as weak or deformed. The children of slaves are seldon? allowed to live.
Girls are more subject to exposure than boys, for every daughter has to
be provided with a dowry, and at marriage she passes from the home and
service of those who have reared her into the service of those who have
not. Exposure is effected by leaving the infant in a large earthenware
vessel within the precincts of a temple or in some other place where it
can soon be rescued if any wish to adopt it. The parental right to
expose permits a rough eugenics, and co-operates with a rigorous natural
selection by hardship and competition to make the Greeks a strong and
healthy people. The philoso- phers almost unanimously approve of family
limitation: Plato will call for the exposure of all feeble children, and
of those bom of base or elderly parents;^ and Aristotle will defend
abortion as preferable to infanticide.* The Hippo- cratic code of
medical ethics will not allow the physician to effect abortion, but the
Greek midwife is an experienced hand in this field, and no law impedes
her.**</p>
<p>On or before the tenth day after birth the child is formally accepted
into the family with a religious ritual around the hearth, and receives
presents and a name. Usually a Greek has but one name, like Socrates or
Archimedes; but since it is customary to call the eldest son after the
paternal grandfather, repe- tition is frequent, and Greek history is
confounded with a multiplicity of Xeno- phons, Aeschineses,
Thucydideses, Diogeneses, and Zenos. To avoid ambiguity the father’s
name or the place of birth ma y be added, as with Kimon Miltiadou</p>
<ul>
<li>We have no evidence of contraceptive devices among the Greeks.^</li>

<p>288</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>— Cimon son of Miltiades — or Diodorus Siculus — DioAoms of Sicily;
or the prob- lem may be solved by some jolly nickname, like Callimedon —
The Crab.®</p>
<p>Once the child is so accepted into the family it cannot lawfully be
exposed, and is reared with all the affection that parents lavish upon
their children in every age. Themistocles describes his son as the real
ruler of Athens; for he, Themistocles, the most influential man in the
city, is ruled by his wife, who is ruled by their child.® Many an
epigram in The Greek Anthology reveals a ten- der parental love:</p>
<p>I wept at the death of my Theonoe, but the hopes centered in</p>
<p>our child lightened my sorrows. And now envious Fate has be-</p>
<p>reaved me of the boy as well. Alas! I am cheated of thee, my</p>
<p>child, all that was left to me. Persephone, hear this cry of a
father’s</p>
<p>grief, and lay the child upon his dead mother’s breast.^</p>
<p>The tragedies of adolescence are eased with many games, some of which
will survive the memory of Greece. On a white perfume vase made for a
child’s grave a little boy is seen taking his toy cart with him down to
Hades.® Babies have terra-cotta rattles containing pebbles; girls keep
house with their dolls, boys fight great campaigns with clay soldiers
and generals, nurses push children on swings or balance them on seesaws,
boys and girls roll hoops, fly kites, spin tops, play hide-and- seek or
blindman’s buff or tug of war, and wage a hundred merry contests with
pebbles, nuts, coins, and balls. The marbles of the Golden Age are dried
beans shot from the fingers, or smooth stones shot or tossed into a
circle to dislodge enemy stones and come to rest as near as possible to
the center. As children approach the “age of reason”— seven or eight —
they take up the game of dice by throwing square knucklebones
{astragali)^ the highest throw, six, being counted the best.® The games
of the young are as old as the sins of their fathers.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>EDUCATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Athens provides public gymnasiums and palaestras, and exercises some
loose supervision over teachers; but the city has no public schools or
state universi- ties, and education remain s in private hands. Plato
advocates state schools,“’ but Athens seems to believe that even in
education competition will produce the best results. Professional
schoolmasters set up their own schools, to which freeborn boys are sent
at the age of sk. The name paidagogos is given not to the teacher but to
the slave who conducts the boy daily to and from school; we hear of no
boarding scliools. Attendance at school continues till fourteen or
sixteen, or till a later age among the well to do.“ The schools have no
desks but only benches; the pupil holds on his knee the roll from which
he reads or</p>
<p>CHAP, xra) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 289</p>
<p>the material upon which he writes. Some schools, anticipating much
later fash- ions, are adorned with statues of Greek heroes and gods; a
few are elegantly furnished. The teacher teaches all subjects, and
attends to character as well as intellect, using a sandal.</p>
<p>The curriculum has three divisions — writing, music, and gymnastics;
eager modernists wi ll add, in Aristotle’s day, drawing and painting.^“
Writing includes reading and arithmetic, which uses letters for numbers.
Everyone learns to play the lyre, and much of the material of
instruction is put into poetical and musical form.“ No time is spe nt in
acquiring any foreign language, much less a dead one, but great care is
taken in learning the correct usage of the mother tongue. Gymnastics are
taught chiefly in the gymnasium and the palaestra, and no one is
considered educated who has not learned to wrestle, swim, and use the
bow and the sling.</p>
<p>The education of girls is carried on at home, and is largely confined
to “domestic science.” Outside of Sparta girls take no part in public
gymnastics. They are taught by their mothers or nurses to read and write
and reckon, to spin and weave and embroider, to dance and sing and play
some instrument. A few Greek women are well educated, but these are
mostly hetairai; for respect- able ladies there is no secondary
education, until Aspasia lures a few of them into rhetoric and
philosophy. Higher education for men is provided by pro- fessional
rhetors and sophists, who offer instruction in oratory, science,
philoso- phy, and history. These independent teachers engage lecture
halls near the gymnasium or palaestra, and constitute together a
scattered university for pre- Platonic Athens. Only the prosperous can
study under them, for they charge high fees; but ambitious youths work
by night in mill or field in order to be able to attend by day the
classes of these nomadic professors.</p>
<p>When boys reach the age of sixteen they are expected to pay special
atten- tion to physical exercises, as fitting them in some measure for
the tasks of war. Even their sports give them indirectly a military
preparation: they run, leap, wrestle, hunt, drive chariots, and hurl the
javelin. At eighteen they enter upon the second of the four stages of
Athenian life (pais, ephebos, aner, geron — chUd^ youth, man, elder),
and are enrolled into the ranks of Athens’ soldier y outh, the epheboi.t
Under moderators chosen by the leaders of their tribes they are trained
for two years in the duties of citizenship and war. They live and eat
together, wear an impressive uniform, and submit to moral supervision
night and day. They organize themselves democratically on the model of
the city, meet in assembly, pass resolutions, and erect laws for their
own governance;</p>
<p>• In one of the pictures at Pompeii, probably copied from the Greek,
we see a pupil sup - ported upon the shoulders of another, and held at
his heels by a third, while the teacher flogs him.“</p>
<p>tThis institution, however, cannot yet be traced back beyond 336
b.c.</p>
<p>290 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XIH</p>
<p>they have archoiib, strategoiy and judges.” For the first year th ey
are schooled with strenuous drill, and hear lectures on literature,
music, geometry, and rhet- oric.” At nineteen they are assigned to
garrison the frontier, and are entrusted for two years with the
protection of the city against attack from without and disorder within.
Solemnly, in the presence of the Council of Five Hundred, with hands
stretched over the altar in the temple of Agraulos, they take the oath
of the young men of Athens:</p>
<p>I will not disgrace the sacred arms, nor will I abandon the man</p>
<p>next to me, whoever he may be. I will bring aid to the ritual of
the</p>
<p>state, and to the holy duties, both alone and in company with
many.</p>
<p>I will transmit my native commonwealth not lessened, but larger</p>
<p>and better than I have received it. I will obey those who from
time</p>
<p>to time are judges; I will obey the established statutes, and
what-</p>
<p>ever other regulations the people shall enact. If anyone shall
attempt to destroy the statutes I will not permit it, but will repel him
both</p>
<p>alone and with all. I w iU honor the ancestral faith.”</p>
<p>The epheboi are assigned a special place at the theater, and play a
prominent role in the religious processions of the city; perhaps it is
such young men that we see riding so handsomely on the Parthenon frieze.
Perio^cally they exhibit their accomplishments in public contests, above
all in the relay torch race from the Piraeus to Athens. All the city
comes out for this picturesque event, and lines the four-and-a-half-mile
road; the race is run at night, and the way is not illuminated; all that
can be seen of the runners is the leaping light of the torches that they
carry forward and pass on. When, at the age of twenty- one, the training
of the epheboi is completed, they are freed from parental authority, and
formally admitted into the full citizenship of the city.</p>
<p>Such is the education — eked out by lessons learned in the home and
in the street — that produces the Athenian citizen. It is an excellent
combination of physical and mental, moral and esthetic, training, of
supervision in youth with freedom in maturity; and in its heyday it
turns out young men as fine as any in history. After Pericles theory
grows and beclouds practice; philosophers debate the goals and methods
of education — whether the teacher should aim chiefly at intellectual
development or at moral character, chiefly at practical ability or the
promotion of abstract science. But aU agree in attaching the highest
importance to education. When Aristippus is asked in what way the
educated are super ior to the untutored he answers, “as broken horses
are to the unbroken”; and Aristotle to the same question replies, “as
the living are to the dead.” At least, adds Aristippus, “If the pupil
derives no other good, he will not, when he attends the theate r, be one
stone upon another.””</p>
<p>CHAP, xni) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 291</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>EXTERNALS</li>
</ol>
<p>The citizens of Athens, in the fifth century, are men of medium
height, vigorous, bearded, and not all as handsome as Pheidias’
horsemen. The ladies of the vases are graceful, and those of the stelae
have a dignified loveliness, and those molded by the sculptors are
supremely beautiful; but the actual ladies of Athens, limited in their
mental development by an almost Oriental seclusion, are at best as
pretty as their Near Eastern sisters, but no more. The Greeks admire
beauty even beyond other nations, but they do not always embody it.
Greek women, like others, find their figures a little short of
perfection. They lengthen them with high cork soles on their shoes, pad
out deficiencies with wadding, compress abundances with lacing, and
support the breasts with a cloth brassiere.*”</p>
<p>The hair of the Greeks is usually dark; blondes are exceptional, and
much admired; many women, and some men, dye their hair to make it
blonde, or to conceal the grayness of age.” Both sexes use oils to help
the growth of the hair and to protect it against the sun; the women, and
again some men, add perfumes to the oil.” Both sexes, in the sixth
century, wear th e hair long, usually bound in braids around or behind
the head. In the fifth century the women vary their coiffure by knotting
the hair low on the nape of the neck, or letting it fall over the
shoulders, or around the neck and upon the breast. The ladies like to
bind their hair with gay ribbons, and to adorn these with a jewel on the
forehead.” After Marathon the men begin to cut their hair; after
Alexander they will shave their mustaches and beards with sickle-shaped
razors of iron. No Greek ever wears a mustache without a beard. The
beard is neatly trimmed, usually to a point. The barber not only cuts
the hair and shaves or trims the beard, but he manicures his customer
and otherwise polishes him up for presentation; when he has finished he
offe rs him a mirror in the most modem style.” The barber has his shop,
which is a center for the “wineless symposia” (as Theophrastus calls
them) of the local gossips and gadflies; but he often works outside it
under the sky. He is garrulous by profession; and when one of his kind
asks King Archelaus of Macedon how he would like to have his hair cut
the king answers, “In silence.”” The women also shave here and there,
using razors or depilatories of arsenic and lime.</p>
<p>Perfumes — made from flowers, with a base of oil — are numbered in
the</p>
<p>• Plutarch tells a pretty story of how an epidemic of suicide among
the women of Miletus was suddenly and completely ended by an ordinance
decreeing that self-slain women should be carried naked through the
marketplace to their burial.“</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>(chap, xra</p>
<p>hundreds; Socrates complains that men make so much use of them.”
Every lady of class has an armory of mirrors, pins, hairpins, safety
pins, tweezers, combs, scent bottles, and pots for rouge and creams.
Cheeks and lips are painted with sticks of minium or alkanet root;
eyebrows are penciled with lampblack or pulverized antimony; eyelids are
shaded with antimony or kohl; eyelashes are darkened, and then set with
a mixture of egg white and gum ammoniac. Creams and washes are used for
removing wrinkles, freckles, and spots; disagreeable applications are
kept on the face for hours in the patient lust to seem, if one cannot
be, beautiful. Oil of mastic is em- ployed to prevent perspiration, and
specific perfumed unguents are ap- plied to various parts of the body; a
proper lady uses palm oil on the face and breast, marjoram on the
eyebrows and hair, essence of thyme on the throat and knees, mint on the
arms, myrrh on the legs and feet.” Against this seductive armament men
protest to as much effect as in other ages. A character in Athenian
comedy reproves a lady in cosmetic detail: “If you go out in summer, two
streaks of black run from your eyes; perspiration makes a red furrow
from your cheeks to your neck; and when your hair touches your face it
is blanched by the white lead.”* Women remain the same, because men
do.</p>
<p>Water is limited, and cleanliness seeks substitutes. The well to do
bathe once or twice daily, using a soap made of olive oil mixed with an
alkali into a paste; then they are anointed with fragrant essences.
Comfortable homes have a paved bathroom in which stands a large marble
basin, usually filled by hand; sometimes water is brought by pipes and
channels into the house and through the wall of the bathroom, where it
spouts from a metal nozzle in the shape of an animal’s head, and falls
upon the floor of a small shower-bath enclosure, whence it runs out into
the garden.* Most people, unable to spare water for a bath, rub
themselves with oil, and then scrape it off with a crescent- shaped
strigil, as in Lysippus’ Apoxyomenos. The Greek is not fastidiously
clean; his hygiene is not so much a matter of indoor toilette as of
abstemious diet and an active outdoor life. He seldom sits in closed
homes, theaters, churches, or halls, rarely works in closed factories or
shops; his drama, his worship, even his government, proceed under the
sun; and his simple clothing, which lets the air reach every part of his
body, can be thrown aside with one swing of the arm for a bout of
wrestling or a bath of sunshine.</p>
<p>Greek dress consists essentially of two squares of cloth, loosely
draped about the body, and seldom tailored to fit the individual; it
varies in minor detail from city to city, but remains constant for
generations. The chief</p>
<p>CHAP. Xin) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 293</p>
<p>garment at Athens is for men the chiton, or tunic, for women the
peplos, or robe, both made of wool. If the weather requires it these may
be cov- ered with a mantle (himation) or cloak (chlamys), suspended like
them from the shoulders, and falling freely in those natural folds that
so please us in Greek statuary. In the fifth century clothing is usually
white; women, rich men, and gay youths, however, go in for color, even
for purple and dark red, and colored stripes and embroidered hems; and
the women may bind a colored girdle about the waist. Hats are unpopular
on the ground that they keep moisture from the hair and so make it
prematurely gray;” the head is covered only in traveling, in battle, and
at work under the hot sun; women may wear colored kerchiefs or bandeaux;
workers sometimes wear a cap and nothing else.” Shoes are sandals, high
shoes, or boots; usu - ally of leather, black for men, colored for
women. The ladies of Thebes, says Dicaearchus, “wear low purple shoes
laced so as to show the bare feet.”” Most children and workingmen
dispense with shoes altogether; and no one bothers with stockings.”</p>
<p>Both sexes announce or disguise their incomes with jewelry. Men wear
at least one ring; Aristotle wears several.” The walking sticks of the
men</p>

<li>MORALS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Athenians of the fifth century are not exemplars of morality; the
progress of the intellect has loosened many of them from their ethical
tra- ditions, and has turned them into almost unmoral individuals. They
have a high reputation for legal justice, but they are seldom altruistic
to any but their children; conscience rarely troubles them, and they
never dream of loving their neighbors as themselves. Manners vary from
class to class; in the dialogues of Plato life is graced with a charming
courtesy, but in the comedies of Aristophanes there are no manners at
all, and in public oratory</p>
<p>294 ’I’HE life of GREECE (CHAP. Xm</p>
<p>personal abuse is relied upon as the very soul of eloquence; in such
matters the Greeks have much to learn from the time- pohshed
“barbarians” of Egypt or Persia or Babylon. Salutation is cordial but
simple; there is no bowing, for that seems to the proud citizens a
vestige of monarchy; hand- shaking is reserved for oaths or solemn
farewells; usually the greeting is merely C&amp;«Ve — “Rejoice”—
followed, as elsewhere, by some brilliant re- mark about the
weather.“</p>
<p>Hospitality has lessened since Homeric days, for travel is a little
more secure than then, and inns provide food and shelter for transients;
even so it remains an outstanding virtue of the Athenians. Strangers are
welcomed though without introduction; if they come with letters from a
common friend, they receive bed and board, and sometimes parting gifts.
An in- vited guest is always privileged to bring an uninvited guest with
him. This freedom of entry gives rise in time to a class of parasites —
pdrrawVoi — a word originally applied to the clergy who ate the “com
left over” from the temple supplies. The well to do are generous givers
in both public and private philanthropy; the practice as well as the
word is Greek. Char- ity — or love — is also present; there are many
institutions for the</p>
<p>care of strangers, the sick, the poor, and the old.” The government
pro vides pensions for wounded soldiers, and brings up war orphans at
the expense of the state; in the fourth century it will make payments to
disabled work- men.” In periods of drought, war, or other crisis, the
state pays two obols (34 cents) a day to the needy, in addition to the
regular fees for attendance at the Assembly, the courts, and the plays.
There are the normal scandals; a speech of Lysias concerns a man who,
though on public relief, has rich men for his friends, earns money by
his handicraft, and rides horses for recreation.“</p>
<p>The Greek might admit that honesty is the best policy, but he tries
every- thing else first. The choras in Sophocles’ Philoctetes expresses
the tender - est sympathy for the wounded and deserted soldier, and then
takes advan- tage of his slumber to counsel Neoptolemus to betray him,
steal his weapons, and leave him to his fate. Everyone complains that
the Athenian retailers adulterate their goods, give short weight and
short change despite the gov- ernment inspectors, shift the fulcrum of
their scales towards the measur- ing weights,“* and lie at every
opportunity; the sausages, for example, are accused of being dogs.“ A
comic dramatist calls the fishmongers “assas - sins”; a gentler poet
calls them “burglars.”“ The pohticians are not much better; there is
hardly a man in Athenian public life that is not charged with
crookedness;“ an honest man like Aristides is considered exciting news,
al-</p>
<p>CHAP, xni) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 295</p>
<p>most a mo nstrosity; even Diogenes’ daytime lantern does not find
another. Thucydides reports that men are more anxious to be called
clever than honest, and suspect honesty of simplicity.“ It is an easy
matter to find Greeks who will betray their country: “At no time,” says
Pausanias, “was Greece wanting in people afflicted with this itch for
treason.”“ Bribery is a popular way to political advancement, criminal
impunity, diplomatic ac- complishments; Pericles has large sums voted to
him for secret uses, pre- sumably for lubricating international
negotiations. Morality is strictly tribal; Xenophon, in a treatise on
education, frankly advises lying and rob- bery in dealing with the
enemies of one’s country.“ The Athenian envoys at Sparta in 432 defend
their e mpire in plain terms: “It has always been the law that the
weaker should be subject to the stronger … no one has ever allowed the
cry for justice to hinder his ambition when he had a chance of gaining
anything by might”“— though this passage, and the supposed speech of the
Athenian leaders at Melos,“ may be exercises of Thucydides’
philosophical imagination, inflamed by the cynical discourses of certain
Sophists; it would be as fair to judge the Greeks from the
unconventional ethics of Gorgias, Callicles, Thrasymachus, and
Thucydides as it would be to describe the modern European by the
brilliant bizarreries of Machia- velli. La Rochefoucauld, Nietzsche, and
Stimer — not saying how fair that would be. That something of this
superiority to morals is an active in- gredient in the Greek character
appears in the readiness with which the Spartans agree with the
Athenians on these mooted points of morals. When the Lacedaemonian
Phoebidas, despite a treaty of peace, treacherously seizes upon the
citadel of Thebes, and the Spartan King Agesilaus is ques- tioned about
the justice of this action, he replies: “Inquire only if it is useful;
for whenever an action is useful to our country it is right.” Time and
again truces are violated, solemn promises are broken, envoys are
slain.“ Perhaps, however, the Greeks differ from ourselves not in
conduct but in candor; our greater delicacy makes it offensive to us to
preach what we practice.</p>
<p>Custom and religion among the Greeks exercise a very modest restraint
upon the victor in war. It is a regular matter, even in civil wars, to
sack the conquered city, to finish off the wounded, to slaughter or
enslave all unransomed prisoners and all captured noncombatants, to bum
down the houses, the fruit trees, and the crops, to exterminate the live
stock, and to destroy the seed for future sowings.“ At the opening of
the Peloponnesian War the Spartans butcher as enemies all Greeks whom
they find on the sea, whether allies of Athens or neutrals;® at the
battle of Aegospotami,</p>

<p>which closes the war, the Spartans put to death thre^ thousand
Athenian prisoners® — almost the selected best of Athens’ depleted
citizenry. War of some kind — of city against city or of class against
class — is a normal condi- tion in Hellas. In this way the Greece that
defeated the King of filings turns upon itself, Greek meets Greek in a
thousand battles, and in the course of a century after Marathon the most
brilliant civilization in history con- sumes itself in a prolonged
national suicide.</p>
<p>V. character</p>
<p>If we are still attracted to these reckless disputants it is because
they cover the nakedness of their sins with an exhilarating vigor of
enterprise and intellect. The nearness of the sea, the opportunities of
trade, the free- dom of economic and political life form the Athenian to
an unprecedented excitability and resilience of temper and thought, a
very fever of mind and sense. What a change from the Orient to Europe,
from the drowsy</p>
<p>southern regions to these intermediate states where winter is cold
enough to invigorate without dulling, and summer warm enough to liberate
with- out enfeebling body and soul! Here is faith in life and man, a
zest of living never rivaled again until the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Out of this stimulating milieu comes courage, and an impulsiveness
all the world away from the self-control — which the philosophers</p>
<p>vainly preach, or the Olympian serenity which young Winckelmann and
old Goethe will foist upon the p assionate and restless Greeks. A
nation’s ideals are usually a disguise, and are not to be taken as
history. Courage and temperance — or manliness, and the meden agan, or
“nothing in ex - cess” of the Delphic inscription— are the rival mottoes
of the Greek; he realizes the one frequently enough, but the other only
in his peasants, philosophers, and saints. The average Athenian is a
sensualist, but with a good conscience; he sees no sin in the pleasures
of sense, and finds in them the readiest answer to the pessimism that
darkens his meditative inter- vals. He loves wine, and is not ashamed to
get drunk now and then; he loves women, in an almost innocently physical
way, easily forgives him- self for promiscuity, and does not look upon a
lapse from virtue as an irremediable disaster. Nevertheless he dilutes
two parts of wine with three of water, and considers repeated
drunkenness an offense against good taste. Though he seldom practices
moderation he sincerely worships it, and for- mulates more clearly than
any other people in history the ideal of self- mastery.</p>
<p>CHAP.XUl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 297</p>
<p>The Athenians are too brilliant to be good, and scorn stupidity more
than they abominate vice. They are not all sages, and we must not pic-
ture their woman as all lovely Nausicaas or stately Helens, or their men
as combining the courage of Ajax with Nestor’s wisdom; history has remem
- bered the geniuses of Greece and has ignored her fools (except Nicias)
; even our age may seem great when most of us are forgotten, and only
our mountain peaks have escaped the obscurity of time. Discounting the
pathos of distance, the average Athenian remains as subtle as an
Oriental, as enamored of novelty as an American; endlessly curious and
perpetually mobile; always preaching a Parmenidean calm and always
tossed upon a Heracleitean sea. No people ever had a livelier fancy, or
a readier tongue. Clear thought and clear expression seem divine things
to the Athenian; he has no patience with learned obfuscation, and looks
upon informed and intelligent conversation as the highest sport of
civilization. The secret of the exuberance of Greek life and thought
lies in this, that to the Greek, man is the measure of all things. The
educated Athenian is in love with reason, and seldom doubts its ability
to chart the universe. The desire to know and understand is his noblest
passion, and as immoderate as the rest. Later he will discover the
limits of reason and human effort, and by a nat- ural reaction will fall
into a pessimism strangely discordant with the char- acteristic buoyancy
of his spirit. Even in the century of his exuberance the thought of his
profoundest men — who are not his philosophers but his dramatists — will
be clouded over with the elusive brevity of delight and the patient
pertinacity of death.</p>
<p>As inquisitiveness generates the science of Greece, so
acquisitiveness es- tablishes and dominates its economy. “Love of wealth
wholly absorbs men,” says Plato, with the exaggerati on usual in
moralists, “and never for a mo - ment allows them to think of anything
but their own private possessions; on this the soul of every citizen
hangs suspended.”® The Athenians are competitive animals, and stimulate
one another vsdth nearly ruthless rivalry. They are shrewd, and give the
Semites a close run in cunning and strata- gem; they are every bit as
stiff-necked as the Biblical Hebrews, as pug- nacious, obstinate, and
proud. They bargain virulently in buying and sell- ing, argue every
point in conversation, and, when they cannot make war upon other
countries, quarrel among themselves. They are not given to sentiment,
and disapprove of Euripides’ tears. They are kind to animals and cruel
to men: they regularly use torture upon unaccused slaves, and sleep
heartily, to all appearances, after slaughtering a cityful of noncom-
batants. Nevertheless they are generous to the poor or the disabled;

<p>when the Assembly leams that the granddaughter of Aristogeiton the
tyrannicide is living in destitution on Lemnos, it provides funds to
bring her to Athens and to give her a dowry and a husband. The oppressed
and hunted of other cities find a sympathetic refuge in Athens.</p>
<p>In truth the Greek does not think of character in our terms. He
aspires neither to the conscience of the good bourgeois, nor to the
sense of honor of the aristocrat. To the Greek the best life is the
fullest one, rich in</p>
<p>health, strength, beauty, passion, means, adventure, and thought.
Virtue is arete, manly — literally and originally, martial — excellence
(Ares, Mars) ; pre- cisely what the Romans called vir-tus, man-liness.
The Athenian ideal man is the kalokagathos, who combines beauty and
justice in a. gracious art of living that frankly values abihty, fame,
wealth, and friends as well as vir- tue and humanity; as with Goethe,
self-development is everything. Along with this conception goes a degree
of vanity whose candor is hardly to our taste: the Greeks never tire of
admiring themselves, and announce at every turn their superiority to
other warriors, writers, artists, peoples. If we wish to understand the
Greeks as against the Romans we must think of the French vs. the
English; if we wish to feel the Spartan spirit as opposed to the
Athenian we must think of the Germans vs. the French.</p>
<p>All the qualities of the Athenians come together to make their
city-state. Here is the creation and summation of their vigor and
courage, their brilliance and loquacity, their unruliness and
acquisitiveness, their vanity and patriotism, their worship of beauty
and freedom. They are rich in passions but poor in prejudices. Now and
then they tolerate religious in- tolerance, not as a check upon thought
but as a weapon in partisan politics, and as a bound to moral
experimentation; otherwise they insist upon a degree of liberty that
seems fantastically chaotic to their Oriental visitors. But because they
are free, because, ultimately, every office is open to every citizen,
and each is ruled and ruler in turn, they give half their lives to their
state. Home is where they sleep; they live in the market place, in the
Assembly, in the Council, in the courts, in the great festivals,
athletic contests, and dramatic spectacles that glorify theit city and
its gods. They recognize the right of the state to conscript their
persons and their wealth for its needs. They forgive its exactions
because it gives more opportunity for human development than man has
ever known before; they fight for it fiercely because it is the mother
and guardian of their liberties. “Thus,” says Herodotus, “did the
Athenians increase in strength. And it is plain enough, not from this
instance only but from many examples, that freedom is an excellent
thing; since even the Athenians, who,, while they continued un-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 299</p>
<p>der the rule of dictators, were not a whit more valiant than any of
their neighbors, no sooner shook oflF the yoke than they became
decidedly the first of all.”“</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>PREMARITAL RELATIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>In morality, as in alphabet, measures, weights, coinage, costume,
music, as- tronomy, and mystic cults, classic Athens seems more Oriental
than European. The physical basis of love is accepted frankly by both
sexes; the love philters that anxious ladies brew for negligent men have
no merely Platonic aim. Pre- marital chastity is required of respectable
women, but among unmarried men after the ephebic period there are few
moral restraints upon desire. The great festivals, though religious in
origin, are used as safety valves for the natural promiscuity of
humanity; sexual license on such occasions is condoned in the belief
that monogamy may be more easily achieved during the balance of the
year. No stigma is attached in Athens to the occasional intercourse of
young men with courtesans; even married men may patronize them without
any greater moral penalty than a scolding at home and a slightly
tarnished repu- tation in the city.” Athens ofiic ially recognizes
prostitution, and levies a tax upon its practitioners.”</p>
<p>With a career so open to talent, harlotry becomes in Athens, as in
most other cities of Greece, a well-plied profession with many
specialties. The lowest order of them, the pomai, live chiefly at the
Piraeus, in common brothels marked for the convenience of the public
with the phallic symbol of Priapus. An obol secures admission to these
houses, where the girls, so lightly clad that they are called gymnai
(naked), allow their prospective purchasers to examine them like dogs in
a kennel. A man may strike a bargain for any period of time, and may
arrange with the madam of the house to take a girl to live with him for
a week, a month, or a year; sometimes a girl is hired out in this way to
two or more men, distributing her time among them according to their
means.® Higher than these girls in the affection of the Athenians are
the auletrides, or flute- players, who, like the geisha of Japan, assist
at “stag” entertainments, pro - vide music and gaiety, perform dances
artistic or lascivious, and then, if prop- erly induced, mingle with the
guests and spend the night with them.” A few old courtesans may stave
off destitution by developing training schools for such flute girls, and
teaching them the science of cosmetic adornment, personal
transfiguration, musical entertainment, and amorous dalliance. Tradition
hands down carefully from one generation of courtesans to another, like
a precious heritage, the arts of inspiring love by judicious display,
holding it by coy re- fusal, and making it pay.” Nevertheless some of
the auletrides, if we may take Lucian’s word for it from a later age,
have tender hearts, know real affection.</p>
<p>300 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>and ruin themselves, Camille- like, for their lovers’ sakes. The
honest courtesan is an ancient theme hoary with the dignity of age.</p>
<p>The highest class of Greek courtesans is composed of the hetairai —
literally, companions. Unlike the porncd^ who are mostly of Oriental
birth, the hetairai are usually women of the citizen class, who have
fallen from the respectability or fled from the seclusion required of
Athenian maids and matrons. They live independently, and entertain at
their own homes the lovers whom they lure. Though they are mostly
brunettes by nature, they dye their hair yellow in the belief that
Athenians prefer blondes; and they distinguish themselves, appar- ently
under legal compulsion, by wearing flowery robes.®* By occasional read-
ing, or attending lectures, some of them acquire a modest education, and
amuse their cultured patrons with learned conversation. Thais, Diotima,
Thargelia, and Leontium, as well as Aspasia, are celebrated as
philosophical disputants, and sometimes for their polished literary
style.®® Many of them are renowned for their wit, and Athenian
literature has an anthology of hetairai epigrams.®® Though all
courtesans are denied civil rights, and are forbidden to enter any
temple but that of their own goddess. Aphrodite Pandemos, a select
minority of the hetairai enjoy a high standing in male society at
Athens; no man is ashamed to be seen with these; philosophers contend
for their favors; and an historian chronicles their history as piously
as Plutarch.*”</p>
<p>In such ways a number of them achieve a certain scholastic
immortality. There is Clepsydra, so named because she accepts and
dismisses her lovers by the hourglass; Thargelia, who, as the Mata Hari
of her time, serves the Per- sians as a spy by sleeping with as many as
possible of the statesmen of Athens;®® Theoris, who consoles the old age
of Sophocles, and Archippe, who succeeds her about the ninth decade of
the dramatist’s life;®® Archeanassa, who amuses Plato,™ and Danae and
Leontium, who teach Epicurus the p hilosophy of pleasure; Themistonoe,
who practices her art until she has lost her last tooth and her last
lock of hair; and the businesslike Gnathaena, who, having spent much
time in the training of her daughter, demands a thousand drachmas (f
looo) as the price of the young lady’s company for a night.*^ The beauty
of Phryne is the talk of fourth-century Athens, since she never appears
in public except completely veiled, but, at the Eleusinian festival, and
again on the feast of the Poseidonia, disrobes in the sight of all, lets
down her hair, and goes to bathe in the sea.” For a time she loves and
inspires Praxiteles, and poses for his Aphrodites; from her, too,
Apelles takes his Aphrodite Amdyomene.^ So rich is Phryne from her loves
that she offers to rebuild the walls of Thebes if the Thebans will
inscribe her name on the structure, which they stubbornly refuse to do.
Perhaps she asks too large an honorarium from Euthias; he re- venges
himself by indicting her on a charge of impiety. But a member of the
court is one of her clients, and Hypereides, the orator, is her devoted
lover;</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 3OI</p>
<p>Hypereides defends her not only with eloquence but by opening her
tunic and revealing her bosom to the court. The judges look upon her
beauty, and vindicate her piety.’’*</p>
<p>Lais of Corinth, says Athenaeus, “appears to have been superior in
beauty to any woman that had ever been seen.”^ As many cities as claimed
Homer dis - pute the honor of having witnessed her birth. Sculptors and
painters beg her to pose for them, but she is coy. The great Myron, in
his old age, persuades her; when she disrobes he forgets his white hair
and beard, and offers her all his possessions for one night; whereupon
she smiles, shrugs her rounded shoul- ders, and leaves him statueless.
The next morning, burning with readolescence, he has his hair trimmed,
and his beard cut off; he puts on a scarlet robe and a golden girdle, a
chain of gold around his neck and rings on all his fingers. He colors
his cheeks with rouge, and perfumes his garments and his flesh. He seeks
out Lais, and announces that he loves her. “My poor friend,” she re -
plied, seeing through his metamorphosis, “you are asking me what I
refused to your father yesterday.’”® She lays up a great fortune, but
does not refuse her - self’to poor but comely lovers; she restores the
ugly Demosthenes to virtue by asking ten thousand drachmas for an
evening,” and from the well -to-do Aris- tippus she earns such sums as
scandalize his servant;”” but to the penniless Diogenes she gives
herself for a pittance, being pleased to have philosophers at her feet.
She spends her wealth generously upon temples, public buildings, and
friends, and finally returns, after the custom of her kind, to the
poverty of her youth. She plies her trade patiently to the end; and when
she dies she is honored with a splendid tomb as the greatest conqueror
that the Greeks have ever known.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>GREEK FRIENDSHIP</li>
</ol>
<p>Stranger than this strange entente between prostitution and
philosophy is the placid acceptance of sexual inversion. The chief
rivals of the hetairai are the boys of Athens; and the courtesans,
scandalized to the very depths of their pockets, never tire of
denouncing the immorality of homosexual love. Mer- chants import
handsome lads to be sold to the highest bidder, who will use them first
as concubines and later as slaves;®® and only a negligible minority of
males think it amiss that the effeminate young aristocrats of the city
should arouse and assuage the ardor of aging men. In this matter of
genders Sparta is as careless as Athens; when Aleman wishes to
compliment some girls he calls them his “female boy - friends.””
Athenian law disfranchises those who receive</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>(chap. XHI</p>
<p>tyrannicides and lovers; the most popular in Athens in his day is
Alcibiades, who boasts of the men who love him; as late as Aristotle
“Greek lovers” plight their troth at the tomb of lolaus, comrade of
Heracles;“ and Aristippus de- scribes Xenophon, leader of armies and
hardheaded man of the world, as infat- uated with young Cleinias “ The
attachment of a man to a boy, or of a boy to a boy, shows in Greece all
the symptoms of romantic love — passion, piety, ecstasy, jealousy,
serenading, brooding, moaning, and sleeplessness.“ When Plato, in the
Phaedrus, talks of human love, he means homosexual love; and the
disputants in his Symposium agree on one point — that love between man
and man is nobler and more spiritual than love between man and woman.“ A
simi- lar inversion appears among the women, occasionally among the
finest, as in Sappho, frequently among the courtesans; the auletrides
love one another more passionately than they love their patrons, and the
pornaia are hothouses of Lesbian romance.“</p>
<p>How shall we explain the popularity of this perversion in Greece?
Aristotle attributes it to fear of overpopulation,“ and this may account
for part of the phenomenon; but there is obviously a connection between
the prevalence of both homosexuality and prostitution in Athens, and the
seclusion of women. After the age of six the boys of Periclean Athens
are taken from the gynaeceum in which respectable women spend their
lives, and are brought up chiefly in com- panionship with other boys, or
men; little opportunity is given them, in their formative and almost
neutral period, to know the attractiveness of the tender sex. The life
of the common mess hall in Sparta, of the agora, gymnasium, ’and
palaestra in Athens, and the career of the ephebos, show the youth only
.the male form; even art does not announce the physical beauty of woman
until Praxiteles, In married life the men seldom find mental
companionship at home; the rarity of education among women creates a
gulf between the sexes, and men seek elsewhere the charms that they have
not permitted their wives to acquire. To the Athenian citizen his home
is not a castle but a dormitory; from morning to evening, in a great
number of cases, he lives in the city, and rarely has social contacts
with respectable women other than his wife and daugh- ters. Greek
society is unisexual, and misses the disturbance, grace, and stimu-
lation that the spirit and charm of women will give to Renaissance Italy
and Enlightenment France.</p>
<p>Vm. LOVE AND MARRIAGE</p>
<p>Romantic love appears among the Greeks, but seldom as the cause of
marriage. We find little of it in Homer, where Agamemnon and Achilles
frankly think of Chryseis and Briseis, even of the discouraging
Cassandra, in terms of physical desire. Nausicaa, however, is a warning
against too</p>
<p>CHAP, xm) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 303</p>
<p>broad a generalization, and legends as old as Homer tell of Heracles
and lola, of Orpheus and Eurydice. The lyric poets, again, talk
abundantly of love, commonly in the sense of amorous appetite; stories
like that which Stesichorus tells of a maiden dying for love” are
exceptional; but when Theano, wife of Pythag oras, speaks of love as
“the sickness of a long - ing soul,”“ we feel the authentic note of
romantic rut. As refinement grows, and superimposes poetry upon heat,
the tender sentiment becomes more frequent; and the increasing delay
that civilization places between desire and fulfillment gives
imagination leisure to embellish the object of hope. Aeschylus is still
Homeric in his treatment of sex; but in Sophocles we hear of “Love” who
“rules at will the gods,”*” and in Euripides many a passage proclaims
Eros’ power. The later dramatists often describe a youth desperately
enamored of a girl.” Aristotle suggests the real quality of romantic
adoration when he remarks that “lovers look at the eyes of the beloved,
in which modesty dwells.””</p>
<p>Such affairs in classic Greece lead rather to premarital relations
than to matrimony. The Greeks consider romantic love to be a form of
“posses - sion” or madness, and would smile at anyone who should propose
it as a fit guide in the choice of a marriage mate.” Norma lly marriage
is arranged by the parents as in always classic France, or by
professional matchmakers,“ with an eye not to love but to dowries. The
father is expected to provide for his daughter a marriage portion of
money, clothing, jewelry, and per- haps slaves.“ This remains to its end
the property of the wife, and reverts to her in case of a separation
from her husband — a consideration that dis- courages divorce by the
male. Without a dowry a girl has little chance of marriage; therefore
where the father cannot give it to her the relatives combine to provide
it. Marriage by purchase, so frequent in Homeric days, has by this means
been inverted in Periclean Greece: in effect, as Euripides’ Medea
complains,“ the woman has to buy her master. The Greek, then, marries
not for love, nor because he enjoys matrimony (for he prates end- lessly
about its tribulations), but to continue himself and the state through a
wife suitably dowered, and children who will ward off the evil fate of
an untended soul. Even with these inducements he avoids wedlock as
long</p>

<p>as he can. The letter of the law forbids him to remain single, but
the law is not always enforced in Periclean days; and after him the
number of bachelors mounts until it becomes one of the basic problems of
Athens.“ There are so many ways of being amused in Greece! Those men who
yield marry late, usually near thirty, and then insist upon brides not
much older than fifteen.”“ “To mate a youth with a young wife is ill,”
says a character in Euripides; “for a man’s strength endures, while the
bloom of beauty quickly leaves the woman’s form.””*</p>
<p>A choice having been made, and the dowry agreed upon, a solemn be-
trothal takes place in the home of the girl’s father; there must be
witnesses, but her own presence is not necessary. Without such a formal
betrothal no union is valid in Athenian law; it is considered to be the
first act in the complex rite of marriage. The second act, which follows
in a few days, is a feast in the house of the girl. Before coming to it
the bride and bride- groom, in their separate homes, bathe in-ceremonial
purification. At the feast the men of both families sit on one side of
the room, the women on the other; a wedding cake is eaten, and much wine
is drunk. Then the bridegroom escorts his veiled and white-robed bride —
whose face he may not yet have seen — into a carriage, and takes her to
his father’s dwelling amid a procession of friends and flute-playing
girls, who light the way with torches and raise the hymeneal chant.
Arrived, he carries the girl over the threshold, as if in semblance of
capture. The parents of the youth greet the girl, and receive her with
religious ceremony into the circle of the family and the worship of its
gods; no priest, however, takes any part in the ritual. The guests then
escort the couple to their room with an epithalamion, or
marriage-chamber song, and linger boisterously at the door until the
bridegroom announces to them that the marriage has been consummated.</p>
<p>Besides his wife a man may take a concubine. “We have courtesans for
the sake of pleasure,” says Demosthenes, “concubines for the daily
health of our bodies, and wives to bear us lawful offspring and be the
faithful guardians of our homes”:’““ here in one startling sentence is
the Greek view of woman in the classic age. Draco’s laws permit con
cubinage; and after the Sicilian expedition of 415, when the roll of
citizens has been depleted by war and many girls cannot find husbands,
the law explicitly allows double marriages; Socrates and Euripides are
among those who assume this patriotic obl igation.”* The wife usually
accepts concubinage with Oriental</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 305</p>
<p>wife are accounted legitimate. Adultery leads to divorce only when
com- mitted by the wife; the husband in such case is spoken of as
“carrying horns” (keroesses), and custom requires him to send his wife
away.“‘ The law makes adultery by woman, or by a man with a married
woman, pun- ishable with death, but the Greeks are too lenient to
concupiscence to en- force this statute. The injured husband is usually
left to deal with the adulterer as he will and can — sometimes killing
him in flagrante delicto, sometimes sending a slave to beat him,
sometimes contenting himself with a money indemnity.”*</p>
<p>For the man divorce is simple; he may dismiss his wife at any time,
with- out stating the cause. Barrenness is accepted as sufficient reason
for divorcing a wife, since the purpose of marriage is to have children.
If the man is sterile, law permits, and public opinion recommends, the
reinforcement of the husband by a relative; the child bom of such a
union is considered to be the son of the husband, and must tend his
departed soul. The wife may not at will leave her husband, but she may
ask the archons for a divorce on the ground of the cruelty or excesses
of her mate.”* Divorce is also al - lowed by mutual consent, usually
expressed in a formal declaration to the archon. In case of separation,
even where the husband has been guilty of adultery, the children remain
with the man.““ All in all, in the matter of sex relations, Athenian
custom and law are thoroughly man-made, and represent an Oriental
retrogression from the society of Egypt, Crete, and the Homeric Age.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>WOMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>As surprising as anything else in this civilization is the fact that
it is</p>
<p>brilliant without the aid or stimulus of women. With their help the
Heroic Age achieved splendor, the age of the dictators a lyric radiance;
then, al- most overnight, married women vanish from the history of the
Greeks, as if to confute the supposed correlation between the level of
civilization and the status of woman. In Herodotus woman is everywhere;
in Thucyd- ides she is nowhere to be seen. From Semonides of Amorgos to
Lucian, Greek literature is offensively repetitious about the faults of
women; and towards the close of it even the kindly Plutarch repeats
Thucydides:”* “T he name of a decent woman, like her person, should be
shut up in the house.’”“</p>
<p>This seclusion of woman does not exist among the Dorians; presumably
it comes from the Near East to Ionia, and from Ionia to Attica; it is
part</p>
<p>3o6 the life of Greece (chap.xiii</p>
<p>of the tradition of Asia. Perhaps the disappearance of inheritance
through the mother, the rise of the middle classes, and the enthronement
of the commercial view of life enter into the change: men come to judge
women in terms of utility, and find them especially useful in the home.
The</p>
<p>Oriental nature of Greek marriage goes with this Attic purdah; the
bride is cut off from her kin, goes to live almost as a menial in
another home, and worships other gods. She cannot make contracts, or
incur debts be- yond a trifling sum; she cannot bring actions at law;
and Solon legislates that anything done under the influence of woman
shall have no validity at Iaw.““ When her husband dies she does not
inherit his property. Even physiological error enters into her legal
subjection; for just as primitive ignorance of the male role in
reproduction tended to exalt woman, so the male is exalted by the theory
popular in classic Greece that the generative power belongs only to man,
the woman being merely the carrier and nurse of the child.“ The older
age of the man contributes to the subordina - tion of the wife; he is
twice her years when he marries her, and can in some degree mold her
mind to his own philosophy. Doubtless the male knows too well the
license allowed to his sex in Athens to risk his wife or daugh- ter at
large; he chooses to be free at the cost of her seclusion. She may, if
properly veiled and attended, visit her relatives or intimates, and may
take part in the religious celebrations, including attendance at the
plays; but for the rest she is expected to stay at home, and not allow
herself to be seen at a window. Most of her life is spent in the women’s
quarters at the rear of the house; no male visitor is ever admitted
there, nor does she appear when men visit her husband.</p>
<p>In the home she is honored and obeyed in everything that does not
con- travene the patriarchal authority of her mate. She keeps the house,
or superintends its management; she cooks the meals, cards and spins the
wool, makes the clothing and bedding for the family. Her education is
almost confined to household arts, for the Athenian believes with
Euripides that a woman is handicapped by intellect.^ The result is that
the respectable women of Athens are more m odest, more “charming” to
men, than their like in Sparta, but less interesting and mature,
incapable of being com- rades to husbands whose minds have been filled
and sharpened by a free and varied life. The women of sixth-century
Greece contributed signifi- cantly to Greek literature; the women of
Periclean Athens contribute nothing.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the period a movement arises for the emancipation
of woman. Euripides defends the sex with brave speeches and timid
innu-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 307</p>
<p>endoes; Aristophanes makes fun of them with boisterous indecency. The
women go to the heart of the matter and begin to compete with the
hetairai in making themselves as attractive as the progress of chemistry
will permi t. “What sensible thing are we women capable of doing?” asks
Geonica in Aristophanes’ Lysistrata. “We do nothing but sit around with
our paint and lipstick and transparent gowns, and all the rest of it.’”“
From 41 1 onward female roles become more prominent in Athenian drama,
and reveal the growing escape of women from the solitude to which they
have been confined.</p>
<p>Through it all the real influence of woman over man continues, making
her subjection largely unreal. The greater eagerness of the male gives
woman an advantage in Greece as elsewhere. “Sir,” says Samuel Johnson,
“nature has given woman so much power that the law cannot aflFord to
give her more.”“‘ Sometimes this natural sovereignty is enhanced by a
substantial dowry, or an industrious tongue, or uxorious aflFection;
more often it is the result of beauty, or the bearing and rearing of
fine children, or the slow fusion of souls in the crucible’ of a common
experience and task. An age that can portray such gentle characters as
Antigone, Alcestis, Iphigenia, and Andromache, and such heroines as
Hecuba, Cassandra, and Medea, could not be unaware of the highest and
the deepest in woman. The average Athenian loves his wife, and will not
always try to conceal it; the funeral stelae reveal surprisingly the
tenderness of mate for mate, and of parents for children, in the
intimacy of the home. The Greek Anthol- ogy is vivid with erotic verse,
but it contains also many a touching epigram to a beloved comrade. “In
this stone,” says one epitaph, “Marathonis laid Nicopolis, and bedewed
the marble chest with tears. But it was of no avail. What profit hath a
man whose wife is gone, and who is left solitary on earth?”“*</p>
<p>X. THEHOIVIE</p>
<p>The Greek family, like the Indo-European household in general, is
composed of the father, the mother, sometimes a “second wife,” their
unmarried daugh - ters, their sons, their slaves, and their sons’ wives
and children and slaves. It remains to the end the strongest institution
in Greek civilization, for both in agriculture and in industry it is the
unit and instrument of economic produc- tion. The power of the father in
Attica is extensive, but much narrower than in Rome. He can expose the
newborn child, sell the labor of his minor sons and unwedded daughters,
give his daughters in marriage, and, under certain conditions, appoint
another husband for his widow.”* But he cannot, in Athe -</p>
<p>3o8 the life of Greece (chap. xiii</p>
<p>nian law, sell the persons of his children; and each son, on
marrying, escapes from parental authority, sets up his own home, and
becomes an independent member of the gene.</p>
<p>The Greek house is unpretentious. The exterior is seldom more than a
stout blank wall with a narrow doorway, dumb witnesses to the insecurity
of Greek life. The material is sometimes stucco, usually sun-baked
brick. In the city the houses are crowded together in narrow streets;
often they rise to two stories, occasionally they are tenements housing
several families; but nearly every citi- zen owns an individual home.
Dwellings in Athens are small till Alcibiades sets a fashion of
magnificence; there is a democratic taboo, reinforced by aristo- cratic
precaution, against display; and the Athenian, living for the most part
in the open air, does not endow the home with the significance and
affection that it receives in colder zones. A rich house may have a
colonnaded porch facing the street, but this is highly exceptional.
Windows are a luxury, and are con- fined to the upper story; they have
no panes, but may be closed with shutters, or screened with lattices
against the sun. The entrance door is ordinarily made of double leaves,
turning upon vertical pivots running into the threshold and the lintel.
On the door of many well-to-do houses is a metal knocker, often in the
form of a ring in a lion’s mouth.’<sup>’</sup> The entrance hallway,
except in the poorer dwellings, leads into an mle^ or uncovered court,
commonly paved with stones. Around the court may run a columned portico;
in the center may be an altar, or a cistern, or both, perhaps also
adorned with columns, and paved with a mosaic floor. Light and air come
to the house chiefly through this court, for upon it open nearly all the
rooms; to pass from one room to another it is usually necessary to enter
the portico or the court. In the shade and privacy of the court and the
portico much of the family’s life is lived, and much of its work is
done.</p>
<p>Gardens are rare in the city, and are confined to small areas in the
court or behind the house. Country gardens are more spacious and
numerous; but the scarcity of rain in summer, and the cost of
irrigation, make gardens a luxury in Attica. The average Greek has no
Rousseauan sensitivity to nature; his moun- tains are still too
troublesome to be beautiful, though his poets, despite its dangers,
intone many paeans to the sea. He is not sentimental about nature, so
much as animistically imaginative; he peoples the woods and streams of
his country with gods and sprites, and thinks of nature as not a
landscape but a Valhalla; he names his mountains and rivers from the
divinities that inhabit them; and instead of painting nature directly he
draws or carves symbolic images of the deities that in his poetic
theology give it life. Not till Alexander’s armies - where, and gardens
and florists supply them aU the year round. Flower girls</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 309</p>
<p>peddle roses, violets, hyacinths, narcissi, irises, myrtles, lilacs,
crocuses, and anemones from house to house. Women wear flowers in their
hair, dandies wear them behind the ear; and on festal occasions both
sexes may come forth with flower garlands, lei- like, around the
neck.“®</p>
<p>The interior of the house is simple. Among the poor the floors are of
hard- ened earth; as income rises this basis may be covered with
plaster, or paved with flat stones or with small round stones set in
cement, as in the Near East im- memorially; and all this may be covered
with reed mats or rugs. The brick walls are plastered and whitewashed.
Heating, which is needed for only three months of the year, is furnished
by a brazier whose smoke has to find a way out through the door to the
court. Decoration is minimal; but at the end of the fifth century the
homes of the rich may have pillared halls, walls paneled with marble or
painted imitations of it, mural paintings and tapestries, and ceiling
arabesques. Furniture is scanty in the average home — some chairs, some
chests, a few tables, a bed. Cushions take the place of upholstery on
chairs, but the seats of the rich may be carefully carved, and inlaid
with silver, tortoise, or ivory. Chests serve as both closets and
chairs. Tables are small, and usually three-legged, whence their name
trapezai; they are brought in and removed with the food, and are hardly
used for other purposes; writing is done upon the knee. Couches and beds
are favorite objects for adornment, being often inlaid or elaborately
carved. Leather thongs stretched across the bedstead serve as a spring;
there are mattresses and pillows, and embroidered covers, and com- monly
a raised headrest. Lamps may be hung from the ceiling, or placed upon
stands, or take the form of torches elegantly wrought.</p>
<p>The kitchen is equipped with a great variety of iron, bronze, and
earthen- ware vessels; glass is a rare luxury, not made in Greece.
Cooking is done over an open fire; stoves are a Hellenistic innovation.
Athenian meals are simple, like the Spartan and unlike the Boeotian,
Corinthian, or Sicilian; but when hon- ored guests are expected it is
customary to engage a professional cook, who is always male. Cooking is
a highly developed art, with many texts and heroes; some Greek cooks are
as widely known as the latest victor in the Olympic games. To eat alone
is considered barbarous, and table manners are looked upon as an index
of a civilization’s development. Women an d boys sit at meals before
small tables; men recline on couches, two on each. The family eats to-
gether when alone; if male guests come, the women of the family retire
to the gynaeceum. Attendants remove the sandals or wash the feet of the
guests before the latter recline, and offer them water to cleanse their
hands; some- times they anoint the heads of the guests with fragrant
oils. There are no knives or forks, but there are spoons; solid food is
eaten with the fingers. Dur- ing the meal the fingers are cleaned with
scraps or crumbs of bread; after it with water. Before dessert the
attendants fill the cup of each guest from a</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap, xiti</p>
<p>krater, or mixing bowl, in which wine has been diluted with water.
Plates are of earthenware; silver plate appears as the fifth century
ends. Epicures grow in number in the fourth century; one Pithyllus has
coverings made for his tongue and fingers so that he may eat food as hot
as he likes.^ There are a few vegetarians, whose guests make the usual
jokes and complaints; one diner flees from a vegetarian feast for fear
that he will be offered hay for dessert.“°</p>
<p>Drinking is as important as eating. After the deipnon^ or dinner,
comes the symposioTij or drinking together. At Sparta as well as at
Athens there are drinking clubs whose members become so attached to one
another that such organizations become potent political instruments. The
procedure at banquets is complicated, and philosophers like Xenocrates
and Aristotle think it desirable to set down laws for them.“^ The floor,
upon which uneaten material has been thrown, is swept clean after the
meal; perfumes are passed around, and much wine. The guests may then
dance, not in pairs or with the other sex (for usually only males are
invited), but in groups; or they may play games like kottabos;* or they
may match poems, witticisms, or riddles, or watch profes- sional
performers like the female acrobat in Xenophon’s Symposium^ who tosses
twelve hoops at once and then da nces somersaults through a hoop “set
all around with upright swords.”^ Flute girls may appear, play, sing,
dance, and love as arranged for. Educated Athenians prefer, now and
then, a symposium of conversation, conducted in an orderly manner by a
symposiarch chosen by a throw of the dice to act as chairman. The guests
take care not to break up the talk into small groups, which usually
means small talk; they keep the con- versation general, and listen, as
courteously as their vivacity will permit, to each man in turn. So
elegant a discourse as that which Plato offers us is doubtless the
product of his brilliant imagination; but probably Athens has known
dialogues as lively as his, perhaps profounder; and in any case it is
Athenian society that suggests and provides the background. In that
exciting atmosphere of free wits the Athenian mind is formed.</p>

<li>OLD AGE</li>
</ol>
<p>Old age is feared and mourned beyond wont by the life-loving Greeks.
Even here, however, it has its consolations; for as the used-up body is
returned like worn currency to the mint, it has the solace of seeing,
before it is consumed, the fresh new life through which it cheats
mortality. It is true that Greek his - tory reveals cases of selfish
carelessness or coarse insolence towards the old. Athenian society,
commercial, individualistic, and innovating, tends to be un- kind to old
age; respect for years goes with a religious and conservative
society</p>
<p>• This consisted in throwing liquid from a cup so that it would
strike some small ob ject placed at a distance.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS 3H</p>
<p>like Sparta’s, while democracy, loosening all bonds with freedom,
puts the accent on youth, and favors the new against the old. Athenian
history offers several inst ances of children taking over their parents’
property without proof of imbecility in the elders;^* but Sophocles
rescues himself from such an action simply by reading to the court some
passages from his latest play. Athenian law commands that sons shall
support their infirm or aged parents;^* and public opinion, which is
always more fearful than the law, enjoins modesty and respect in the
behavior of the young towards the old. Plato takes it for granted that a
well-bred youth will be silent in the presence of his seniors unless he
is asked to speak.“® There are in the literature many pictures of modest
adolescence, as in the earlier dialogues of Plato or the Symposium of
Xenophon; and there are touching stories of filial devotion, like that
of Orestes to Agamemnon, and of Antigone to Oedipus.</p>
<p>When death comes, every precaution is taken that the soul of the
departed shall be spared all avoidable suffering. The body must be
buried or burned; else the soul will wander restlessly about the world,
and will revenge itself upon its negligent posterity; it may, for
example, reappear as a ghost, and bring disease or disaster to plants
and men. Cremation is more popular in the Heroic Age, burial in the
classic. Burial was Mycenaean, and will survive into Chris- tianity;
cremation apparently entered Greece with the Achaeans and the Dorians,
whose nomad habits made impossible the proper care of graves. One or the
other is so obligatory among Athenians that the victorious generals at
Argi- nusae are put to death for allowing a severe storm to deter them
from recover- ing and burying their dead.</p>
<p>Greek burial customs carry on old ways into the future. The corpse is
bathed, anointed with perfumes, crowned with flowers, and dressed in the
fin- est garments that the family can afford. An obol is placed between
the teeth to pay Charon, the mythical boatman who ferries the dead
across the Styx to Hades.* The body is placed in a coffin of pottery or
wood; to “have one foot in the cofl〔in” is already a pro verb in
Greece.^® Mourning is elaborate: black garments are worn, and the hair,
or part of it, is shorn as a gift for the dead. On the third day the
corpse is carried on a bier in procession through the streets, while the
women weep and beat their breasts; professional wallers or dirge singers
may be hired for the occasion. Upon the sod of the covered grave wine is
poured to slake the dead soul’s thirst, and animals may be sacrificed
for its food. The mourners lay wreaths of flowers or cypress upon th e
tomb,“’ and then return home to the funeral feast. Since the departed
soul is believed to be present at this feast, sacred custom requires
that “of the dead nothing but good” shall be spoken;^® this is the
source of an ancient saw, and perhaps of the unfailing lauds of our
epitaphs. Periodically the children visit the graves</p>
<p>• It was the custom among the Greeks to carry small change in the
mouth.</p>
<p>TH£ LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>(cHAF. xm</p>
<p>of their ancestors, and offer them food and drink. After the battle
of Plataea, where the Greeks of many cities have fallen, the Plataeans
pledge themselves to provide for all the dead an annual repast; and six
centuries later, in the days of Plutarch, this promise will still be
performed.</p>
<p>After death the soul, separated from the body, dwells as an
insubstantial shade in Hades. In Homer only spirits guilty of
exceptional or sacrilegious offense suffer punishment there; all the
rest, saints and sinners alike, share an equal fate of endless prowling
about dark Pluto’s realm. In the course of Greek history a belief
arises, among the poorer classes, in Hades as a place of expiation for
sins; Aeschylus pictures Zeus as judging the dead there and punishing
the guilty, though no word is said about rewarding the good.“ Only
rarely do we find mention of the Blessed Isles, or the Elysian Fields,
as heavens of eternal happiness for a few heroic souls. The thought of
the gloomy fate awaiting nearly all the dead darkens Greek literature,
and makes Greek life less bright and cheerful than is fitting under such
a sun.</p>
