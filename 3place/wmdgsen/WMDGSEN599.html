<h4 id="chapter-iv-the-convention">CHAPTER IV The Convention</h4>
<p>September 21, 1792 — October 26, 1795</p>
<p>I. THE NEW REPUBLIC</p>
<p>T HE election to this third assembly, which was to see both the
culmi- nation and the decline of the Revolution, was even more
subtly</p>
<p>managed by the Jacobins than that of 1791. The process was carefully
in- direct: the voters chose electors, who met in electoral committee
and chose the deputies to represent their district in the Convention.
Both elections were by voice vote and in public; at each stage the voter
risked injury if he offende d the local leaders. 1 In the cities
conservatives refused to vote; “the number of abstentions was enormous”;
2 of 7 million persons qualified to vote, 6.3 million stayed away. 3 In
Paris the voting began on September 2, and continued for several days
while, at the prison gates, massacres sent out hints how to vote and
survive. In many districts pious Catholics refrained from voting; hence
the strongly royalist Vendee elected nine deputies of whom six would
vote for the execution of the King. 4 In Paris the electoral assembly
met in the Jacobin Club, with the result that all twenty-four of the
deputies chosen to represent the capital were convinced republicans and
supporters of the Commune: Danton, Robespierre, Marat, Desmoulins,
Billaud-Varenne, C ollot d’Herbois, Freron, David (the painter)…. In the
provinces the Girondins did some rigging of their own; so Brissot,
Roland, Condorcet, Petion, Gaudet, Barbaroux, and Buzot earned the right
to serve and die. Amon^ the foreigners elected were Priestley, Cloots,
and Paine. The Due d’Orleans, renamed Citizen Philippe Egalite, was
chosen to repre - sent a radical section of Paris.</p>
<p>When the Convention convened in the Tuileries on September 21, 1792,
it had 750 members. All but two were of the middle class; two were work-
ingmen; nearly all were lawyers. The 180 Girondins, organized, educated,
and eloquent, took the lead in legislation. On the ground that there was
no present danger of invasion, they secured a relaxation of the laws
against suspects, emigres , and priests, and of wartime control over the
economy; free enterprise was restored; soon there were complaints of
profiteering and price manipulation. To squelch a movement among
radicals for the confisca- tion of large estates and their division
among the people, the Gironde, on the first day of the Convention,
carried a measure proclaiming the sanctity of private property. So
appeased, the Gironde agreed with the Mountain and the Plain in
declaring, on September 22, 1792, the First French Republic. 47</p>
<p>4 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>On the same day the Convention decreed that, after a year of
readjust- ment, the Christian calendar should be replaced, in France and
its posses- sions, by a Revolutionary Calendar, in which the years would
be named I (from September 22, 1792, to September 21, 1793), II, III… ,
and the months would be named by their typical weather: Vendemiaire
(vintage), Brumaire (mist), and Frimaire (frost), for autumn; Nivose
(snow), Pluviose (rain), and Ventose (wind), for winter; Germinal
(budding), Floreal</p>
<p>(flowering), and Prairial (meadows), for spring; and Messidor
(harvest), Thermidor (warmth), and Fructidor (fruit), for summer. Each
month was to be divided into three decades of ten days each; each decade
was to end in a decadi, replacing Sunday as a day of rest. The five
remaining days, called sans-culottiaes, were to be national festivals.
The Convention hoped that this calendar would remind Frenchmen not of
religious saints and seasons but of the earth and the tasks that made it
fruitful; Nature would replace God. The new calendar came into use on
November 24, 1793, and died at the end of Anno Domini 1805.</p>
<p>The Gironde and the Mountain agreed on private property, the
republic, and the war upon Christianity; but on several other issues
they differed to the point of death. The Girondins resented the
geographically dispropor- tionate influence of Paris — its deputies and
its populace — on measures affect- ing all France; the Montagnards
resented the influence of merchants and millionaires in determining the
votes of the Girondins. Danton (whose sec- tion had given him 638
electoral votes out of a possible 700) resigned his place as minister of
justice to undertake the task of uniting the Gironde and the Mountain in
a policy of seeking peace with Prussia and Austria. But the Girondins
distrusted him as the idol of radical Paris, and called for a record of
his expenditures as minister; he could not account to their satisfaction
for the sums he had laid out (he was a great believer in bribes), nor
could he explain where he had found the money to buy three houses in or
near Paris, and a large estate in the department of Aube; undeniably he
had been living in a grand style. Calling his questioners ingrates, he
gave up his labors for internal and external conciliation, and joined
forces with Robespierre.</p>
<p>Though second only to Danton in popularity with the sections, Robes-
pierre was as yet a secondary figure among the deputies. In their
balloting for the presidency of the Convention he received six votes,
Roland 235. To most of the deputies he was a dogmatist fertile in
generalities and moral platitudes, a cautious opportunist who waited
patiently for every opening to added power. An underlying consistency in
his proposals had given him a slowly rising influence. He had kept from
direct involvement in the attack upon the Tuileries or in the September
Massacres, but he had accepted them as putting the fear of the people
into the policies of the bourgeoisie. From the beginning he had
advocated adult male suffrage — though in practice he had winked at
keeping royalists and Catholics from the polls. He had de- fended the
institution of private property, and had discouraged the appeal of a few
impoverished souls for the confiscation and redistribution of pos-
sessions; however, he had proposed inheritance and other taxes that
would</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>“reduce by gentle but efficacious measures the extreme inequalities
of wealth.” 5 Meanwhile he bided his time, and allowed his rivals to
wear themselves out with passion and extremes. He seemed convinced that
some- day he would rule — and predicted that someday he would be killed.
6 “He knew, as all these men knew, that almost from hour to hour he
carried his life in his hand.” 7</p>
<p>It was neither Robespierre nor Danton but Marat who completely cham-
pioned the proletariat. On September 25, to celebrate the new republic,
he changed the name of his periodical to Journal de la Republique fr an
false. He was now forty-nine years old (Robespierre was thirty-four,
Danton thirty-three) ; he had less than a year of life remaining to him,
but he filled it with an uncompromising campaign against the Girondins
as enemies of the people, agents of that rising commercial bourgeoisie
which seemed re- solved to make the Revolution the political arm of a
“free enterprise” econ - omy. His violent diatribes reverberated through
Paris, stirring the sections to insurgency, and generating in the
Convention an almost universal hos- tility. The Girondins denounced what
they called the “triumvirate” of Dan - ton, Robespierre, and Marat, but
Danton disowned him and Robespierre avoided him; he sat with the
Mountain, but usually friendless and alone. On September 25, 1792,
Vergniaud and others read to the Convention docu- ments indicating that
Marat had called for a dictatorship and had evoked the massacres. When
the ailing “tribune of the people” rose to defend himself he was
assailed with cries of “Sit down!” “It seems,” he said, “that I have a
great number of personal enemies in this assembly.” “All of us!” cried
out the Girondins. Marat proceeded to repeat his demand for a
dictatorship on the limited Roman style, and acknowledged his
incitations to violence, but he exonerated Danton and Robespierre from
any association with his plans. A deputy proposed that he be arrested
and tried for treason; the motion was defeated. Marat took a pistol from
his pocket, held it to his head, and an- nounced, “If my indictment had
been decreed, I would have blown my brains out at the foot of the
tribune.” 8</p>
<p>The Girondins — who had led France into war — were strengthened in
these months by the victories of French troops and the extension of
French power and revolutionary ideas. On September 21, 1792, General
Anne-Pierre de Montesquiou-Fezensac led his forces to the easy conquest
of Savoy (then part of the kingdom of Sardinia) ; “the progress of my
army,” he reported to the Convention, “is a triumph; in both country and
town the people come out to meet us; the tricolor cockade is worn on all
sides.” 9 On September 27 another French division entered Nice
unopposed; on September 29 it took Villefranche. On November 27, at the
request of local political leaders, Savoy was incorporated into
France.</p>
<p>The conquest of the Rhineland was more difficult. On September 25
General Adam-Philippe de Custine led his volunteers to the capture of
Speyer, taking three thousand prisoners; on October 5 he entered Worms;
on October 19, Mainz; on October 2 1, Frankfurt-am-Main. To win Belgium
(a dependency of Austria) to the Revolution, Dumouriez had to fight
at</p>
<p>5 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Jemappes (November 6) one of the major battles of the war; the
Austrians, after long resistance, retreated, leaving four thousand dead
on the field. Brus- sels fell on November 14, Liege on the
twenty-fourth, Antwerp on the thir- tieth; in these cities the French
were welcomed as liberators. Instead of obeying the Convention’s orders
to move south and join his forces with Cus - tine’s, Dumouriez dallied
in Belgium and enriched himself in dealings with speculators in army
supplies. Reprimanded, he threatened to resign. Danton was sent to
appease him; he succeeded, but suffered guilt by association when (April
5, 1793) Dumouriez defected to the enemy.</p>
<p>Intoxicated with these victories, the Convention leaders adopted two
com- plementary policies: to ex tend France to her “natural boundaries”—
the Rhine, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the seas — and to win the
frontier popula- tions by pledging them military aid in achieving
economic and political free- dom. Hence the bold decree of December 15,
1792:</p>
<p>From this moment the French nation proclaims the sovereignty of the
peo- ple [in all cooperating regions], the suppression of all civil and
military au- thorities which have hitherto governed you, and of all the
taxes which you bear, under whatever form; the abolition of the tithe,
of feudalism,… of serf- dom… ; it also proclaims the abolition among you
of all noble and ecclesi- astical corporations, and of all prerogatives
and privileges as opposed to equality. You are, from this moment,
brothers and friends, all are citizens, equal in rights, and all alike
are called to govern, to serve, and to defend your country. 10</p>
<p>This “Edict of Fraternity” brought a mess of problems upon the young
republic. When the conquered (“liberated”) territories were taxed to sup
- port the French occupation, they complained that one master and his
tax had been replaced by another. When the church hierarchy in Belgium,
Liege, and the Rhineland, long accustomed to hold or share the ruling
au- thority, saw itself challenged in both theology and power, it joined
hands across frontiers and creeds, to repel, and if possible to destroy,
the French Revolution. When, on November 16, 1792, to win the merchants
of Ant- werp to the French cause, the Convention decreed the opening of
the River Scheldt to all navigation — whereas the Peace of Westphalia
(1648) had closed it to all but the Dutch — Holland prepared to resist.
The monarchs of Europe interpreted the Convention’s pl edge as a
declaration of war against all kings and feudal lords. The First
Coalition against France began to take form. The Convention decided to
burn all bridges behind it by bringing Louis XVI to trial for treason.
Since August 10 the Temple had given a semi- humane imprisonment to most
of the royal family: the King, thirty-eight; the Queen, thirty- seven;
his sister, “Madame Elisabeth,” twenty -eight; his daughter, Marie-
Therese (“Madame Royale”), fourteen; and his son, the Dauphin
Louis-Charles, seven. The Girondins did all they could to delay the
trial, for they knew that the evidence would compel conviction and
execution, and that would intensify the attack of the Powers upon
France. Danton agreed with them, but a new figure on the scene,
Louis-Antoine</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>5*</p>
<p>Saint-Just, aged twenty-five, caught the attention of the Convention
by his impassioned call for regicide: “Louis has combated the people and
has been defeated. He is a barbarian, a foreign prisoner of war; you
have seen his perfidious designs…. He is the murderer of the Bastille,
of Nancy, of the Champ-de-Mars,… of the Tuileries. What enemy, what
foreigner has done you more harm?” 11 T his attack might have made the
judicious pause, but on November 20 an iron box discovered in a wall of
the royal chambers in the Tuileries, and brought to the Convention by
Roland, powerfully sup- ported the charge of treason. It contained 625
secret documents, which re- vealed the King’s dealings with Lafayette,
Mirabeau, Talleyrand, Bamave, various emigres and conservative
journalists; clearly Louis, despite his affir- mation of loyalty to the
constitution, had plotted the defeat of the Revolu- tion. The Convention
ordered a veil to be thrown over the bust of Mirabeau; the Jacobins
smashed a statue that had commemorated Mirabeau in their club. Bamave
was arrested in Grenoble; Lafayette fled to his army; Talley- rand, as
always, escaped. On December 2 some delegates from the sections appeared
before the Convention and demanded immediate trial of the King; soon the
Paris Commune sent strong recommendations to the same effect. On
December 3 Robespierre joined in the cry. Marat carried a motion that
all voting in the trial should be by voice and in public — which placed
the hesitant Girondins at the mercy of the sansculottes in the galleries
and in the streets.</p>
<p>The trial began on December 11, 1792, before the full Convention. Ac-
cording to Sebastien Mercier, one of the deputies, “the back of the hall
was converted into boxes, as in a theater, in which ladies wearing the
most charming attire ate ices and oranges and drank liqueurs…. One could
see ushers… escorting the mistresses of the Duke of Orleans.” 12 The
King was shown some of the documents found in the box; he denied his
signature and all knowledge of the box. He met questions by pleading
lapses of memory or putting the responsibility upon his ministers. He
asked for a four-day deferral to let him employ his attorneys. Chretien
de Malesherbes, who had protected the philosophies and the Ency clopedie
under Louis XV, offered to defend the King; Louis sad ly accepted,
saying, “Your sacrifice is the greater because you are exposing your own
life, though you cannot save mine.” 13 (Malesherbes was guillotined in
April, 1794.) Meanwhile agents of the for- eign Powers proposed to buy
some votes for the King; Danton agreed to serve as purchasing agent; but
the sum required proved to be more than their Majesties were willing to
invest. 14</p>
<p>On December 26 Romain de Seze presented the case for the defense. The
Constitution, he argued, gave no authority to the deputies to try the
King; he had been within his human rights in fighting for his life. He
was one of the kindest and most humane men, and one of the most liberal
rulers, who had ever sat on the throne of France. Had the deputies
forgotten his many reforms? Had he not inaugurated the Revolution by
summoning the States- General, and inviting all Frenchmen to tell him of
their wrongs and their</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>desires? The prosecutors replied that the King had negotiated with
foreign powers for the defeat of the Revolution. Why should an exception
be made because the man guilty of treason had inherited the throne? As
long as he remained alive, plots would be laid to restore him to his
pre-Revolution powers. It would be well to make an example which all
monarchs might contemplate before betraying the hopes of their
people.</p>
<p>Voting on the King’s guilt began on January 15, 1793. Out of 749 mem
- bers 683, including his cousin Philippe d’Orleans, declared for
conviction. 1 6 A motion to submit this verdict to ratification or
repeal by the people of France through the primary assemblies was
opposed by Robespierre, Marat, and Saint- Just, and was defeated by 424
votes to 287. “An appeal to the people —” said Saint - Just, “would not
that be the recall of the monarchy?” Robespierre had long advocated
democracy and universal male suffrage, but now he hesitated to trust it;
“virtue,” he said (meaning republican fervor), “has always been in a
minority on the earth.” 16</p>
<p>When, on January 16, the final question was put — “What sentence has
Louis, King of the French, incurred?”— both factions broke out into
violence in the streets. There and in the galleries the crowd cried out
for the death sentence, and threatened the life of anyone who should
vote for anything less. Deputies who, the evening before, had vowed
never to ask for the King’s execution, now fearing for their lives,
voted for his death. Danton</p>
<p>On January 20 a former member of the King’s Garde du Corps killed
Louis-Michel Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau, who had voted for death. On
January 21 a coach, surrounded by an armed escort, and passing along
streets lined by the National Guard, carried Louis XVI to the Place de
la Revolution (now the Place de la Concorde). Before the guillotine he
tried to speak to the multitude: “Frenchmen, I die innocent; it is from
the scaf - fold and near to appearing before God that I tell you so. I
pardon my ene- mies. I desire that France —” but at that point Santerre,
head of the Paris National Guard, called, “Tambours!” and the drums
drowned out the rest. The populace looked in somber silence as the heavy
blade fell, tearing through flesh and bone. “On that day,” a spectator
later recalled, “everyone walked slowly, and we hardly dared look at one
another.” 19</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>53</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SECOND REVOLUTION: 1 793</li>
</ol>
<p>The execution of the King was a victory for the “Mountain,” for
the</p>
<p>Commune, and for the policy of war. It united the “regicides” in
fatal dedi - cation to the Revolution, since they would be the chosen
victims of a Bour- bon restoration. It left the Girondins divided and
desperate; they had split on the vote; they now moved in Paris in fear
of their lives, and longed for the relative peace and order of the
provinces. Roland, sick and disillusioned, resigned from the Executive
Council the day after the execution of the King. Peace, which had been
made possible by the absorption of Austria and Prus- sia in the
partition of Poland, was now made impossible by the fury of Eu- ropean
monarchs at the beheading of one of their fraternity.</p>
<p>In England William Pitt, prime minister, who had thought of making
war against France, found nearly all resistance to that policy gone from
a Parlia- ment and a public shocked by the news that royalty itself had
been laid under the guillotine — as if they themselves, through their
ancestors, had never laid the axe upon Charles I. Pitt’s real reason, of
course, was that French mastery of Antwerp would give to Britain’s
ancient foe the key to the Rhine — the principal avenue of British trade
with Central Europe. That danger took sharper form when, on December 15,
1792, the Convention decreed the annexation of Belgium to France. Now
the road was open to French control of Holland and the Rhineland; all
that rich and well-popu- lated valley could then be closed to a Britain
that lived by exporting the products of an expanding industry. On
January 24, 1793, Pitt dismissed the French ambassador; on February 1
the Convention declared war upon both England and Holland. On March 7
Spain joined them, and the First Coali- tion — Prussia, Austria,
Sardinia, England, Holland, Spain — began the second stage in the effort
to check the Revolution.</p>
<p>A succession of disasters brought the Convention to a tardy
realization of the difficulties it faced. The Revolutionary armies
relaxed after their initial victories; thousands of volunteers quit
after serving the term for which they had enlisted; the total of troops
on the eastern front had fallen from 400,000 to 225,000; and these,
through the incompetence and venality of the con- tractors whom
Dumouriez protected and milked, were poorly clothed and fed. The
generals repeatedly ignored the instructions sent them by the gov-
ernment. On February 24 the Convention resorted to conscription to raise
new armies, but it favored the rich by allowing them to buy substitutes.
Revolts against conscription broke out in several provinces. In the
Vendee, dissatisfaction with conscription and the cost and scarcity of
food joined with anger at the anti-Catholic legislation to generate so
widespread a rebel- lion that an army had to be diverted from the front
to control it. On Febru- ary 16 Dumouriez led twenty thousand troops in
an invasion of Holland; the regiments that he left as a garrison in
Belgium were surprised and an- nihilated by an Austrian force under the
Prince of Saxe-Coburg; Dumouriez</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>himself was defeated at Neerwinden (March 18); and on April 5 he de-
fected to the Austrians with a thousand men. In that month the
representa- tives of England, Prussia, and Austria met and laid plans
for the subjugation of France.</p>
<p>Internal difficulties, added to these external setbacks, threatened
the col- lapse of the French government. Despite expropriation of
ecclesiastical and emigre property, the new assignats were losing value
almost overnight; valued at forty-seven percent of their face value in
April, 1793, they fell to thirty-three percent three months later. 20
New taxes were so widely resisted that the cost of their collection
almost equaled their returns. Forced loans (as of May 20-25, 1 793)
despoiled the rising bourgeoisie; when this class used the Girondins to
protect its interests in the government, it deepened the conflict
between Gironde and Mountain in the Convention. Danton, Robespierre, and
Marat won the Jacobin Club from its original bourgeois policies to more
radical ideas. The Commune, led now by Pierre Chaumette and Jacques
Hebert, used the latter’s fiery journal, Pere Duchesn e, to rouse the
city and besiege the Convention with demands for the conscription of
wealth. Day after day Marat waged war against the Girondins as
protectors of the rich. In February, 1793, Jacques Roux and Jean Varlet
led a group of proletarian “Enrages” in assailing the high cost of bread
and insisting that the Convention should set maximum prices for the
necessaries of life. Harassed by a storm of problems, the Convention
surrendered the tasks of the year 1793 to committees whose decisions it
came to accept with a mini- mum of debate.</p>
<p>Most of these committees were assigned to particular areas of
activity and rule: agriculture, industry and commerce, accounting,
finance, educa- tion, welfare, or colonial affairs. Usually manned by
specialists, they did much good work, even amid the mounting crises;
they prepared a new con- stitution, and left a heritage of constructive
legislation that Bonaparte found helpful in forming the Code
Napoleon.</p>
<p>To guard against foreign agents, internal subversion, and political
offenses, the Convention (March 10, 1793) appointed a Committee of
General Se- curity as a national department of police, with practically
absolute authority to make domiciliary visits without warning and to
arrest anyone on sus- picion of disloyalty or crime. Additional
committees of surveillance were organized for the communes and sections
of the cities.</p>
<p>Also on March 10 the Convention set up a Revolutionary Tribunal to
try suspects sent to it; these were allowed defenders, but the judgment
of the jurors was not subject to appeal or review. On April 5 the
Convention ap- pointed, as principal prosecutor before the Tribunal,
Antoine-Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, a lawyer famous for searching and
merciless examinations, but capable, now and then, of humane sentiments;
21 however, he has come down to us in an engraving that shows him with a
face like an eagle and a nose like a sword. The Tribunal began its
sittings on April 6 in the Palais de Justice. As the war proceeded, and
the number of persons sent up for trial became unmanageably large, the
Tribunal more and more syncopated its</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>legal procedure, and tended to pronounce an early verdict of guilty
in nearly all cases sent to it by the Committee of Public Safety.</p>
<p>This Comite de Salut Public, established on April 6, 1793, replaced
the Executive Council, and became the principal arm of the state. It was
a war cabinet; it must be viewed not as a civil government acknowledging
consti- tutional restraints, but as a body legally authorized to lead
and command a nation fighting for its life. Its powers were limited only
by its responsibility to the Convention; its decisions had to be
submitted to the Convention, which in nearly all cases turned them into
decrees. It controlled foreign policy, the armies and their generals,
the civil functionaries, the committees on religion and the arts, the
secret service of the state. It could open private and public
correspondence; it disposed of secret funds; and through its own
“representatives on mission” it controlled life and death in the
provinces. It met in the rooms of the Pavilion de Flore, between the
Tuileries and the Seine, and gathered for conference around a “green
[cloth - covered] table” which for a year became the seat of the French
government.</p>
<p>At its head, till July 10, sat Danton, now for the second time chosen
to be leader of the nation in peril. He began at once by persuading his
colleagues, and then the Convention, that the government should publicly
renounce any intention to meddle in the internal affairs of any other
nation. 22 At his urging, and over the objections of Robespierre, the
Convention sent out tentatives for peace to each member of the
Coalition. He persuaded the Duke of Brunswick to halt his advance, and
he succeeded in arranging an alliance with Sweden. 23 He tried again to
make peace between the Mountain and the Gironde, but their differences
were too deep.</p>
<p>Marat intensified his attacks upon the Girondins, and with such
mounting violence that they secured (April 14, 1793) a decree of the
Convention that he should be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal for
advocating murder and dictatorship. At his trial a multitude of
sansculottes gathered in the Palais de Justice and the adjacent streets,
vowing to “avenge any outrage</p>
<p>He won a precarious victory when the Convention, over the protests
and warnings of the Gironde, decreed a maximum price for grains at every
stage of their passage from producer to consumer, and ordered
governmental agents to requisition from the growers all produce needed
to meet the public need. 25 On September 29 these measures were extended
into a “general maxi - mum” fixing the price of all basic comm odities.
26 The eternal war between producer and consumer was now accentuated;
peasants revolted against con- scription of their crops; 27 production
fell as the profit motive felt blocked by the new laws; a “black market”
developed, supplying at high p rices those</p>
<p>5 6 THEAGEOFNAPOLEON (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>who could afford to pay. Markets that obeyed the maximum ran out of
grain and bread; hunger riots again ran through city streets.</p>
<p>The Girondins, bitterly resentful of the pressure placed upon the
Conven- tion by the lower orders of Paris, appealed to their
middle-class electors in the provinces to rescue them from the tyranny
of the mob. Vergniaud wrote to his electors in Bordeaux, May 4, 1793: “I
summon you to the tribune to defend us, if there is sti ll time, to
avenge liberty by exterminating tyrants”; 28 and Barbaroux wrote
likewise to his supporters in Marseilles. There and at Lyons the
bourgeois minority allied themselves with former nobles to expel their
radical mayors.</p>
<p>On May 18 the Girondin deputies persuaded the Convention to appoint a
committee to examine the operations of the Paris Commune and its
sections in attempting to influence legislation. All of the members of
the committee were Girondins. On May 24 the Convention ordered the
arrest of Hebert and Varlet as agitators; the Commune, with sixteen
sections concurring, de- manded their release; the Convention refused.
Robespierre, at the Jacobin Club on May 26, urged the citizens to
revolt: “When the people is op - pressed, when it has no resource left
but itself, he would be a coward indeed who should not call upon it to
rise. It is when all laws are violated, it is when despotism is at its
height, it is when good faith and decency are being tram- pled under
foot, that the people ought to rise in insurrection. That moment has
arrived.” 29 In the Convention on May 27 Marat demanded the suppres -
sion of the committee “as hostile to liberty, and as tending to provoke
that insurrection of the people which is only too imminent, owing to the
negli- gence with which you have allowed commodities to rise to an
excessive price.” That night the Mountain secured passage of a measure
abolishing the committee; the prisoners were freed; but on May 28 the
Girondins reestab- lished the committee by a vote of 279 to 238. On May
30 Danton joined Robespierre and Marat in calling for “revolutionary
vigor.”</p>
<p>On May 31 the sections sounded the tocsin for a rising of the
citizens. Gathering at the Hotel de Ville, these formed an
insurrectionary council, and secured the support of the Paris National
Guard under the radical leader Hanriot. Protected Dy these and a
swelling crowd, the new council entered the Convention hall and demanded
that the Girondins be indicted before the Revolutionary Tribunal; that
the price of bread be fixed at three sous a pound throughout France;
that any resulting deficit be met by a levy on the rich; and that the
right to vote be provisionally reserved to sansculottes. 30 The
Convention conceded only the second suppression of the hated com-
mittee. The warring parties retired for the night.</p>
<p>Returning to the Convention on June 1, the council called for the
arrest of Roland, whom the sansculottes identified with the bourgeois
interests. He escaped to southern hospitality. Mme. Roland tarried
behind, planning to plead for him before the Convention; she was
arrested and was lodged in the Abbaye jail; she never saw her husband
again. On June 2 a crowd of eighty thousand men and women, many armed,
surrounded the Convention hall, and the Guard aimed its cannon at the
building. The council informed the</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>deputies that none of them would be permitted to leave until all its
demands had been met. Marat, dominating the rostrum, called out the
names of those Girondins whom he recommended for arrest. Some managed to
elude the Guard and the crowd, and fled to the provinces; twenty-two
were put under house arrest in Paris. From that day till July 26, 1794,
the Convention was to be the obedient servant of the Mountain, the
Committee of Public Safety, and the people of Paris. The Second
Revolution had defeated the bour- geoisie, and had established, pro tem,
the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>
<p>The victors gave form to the new order by commissioning Herault de
Sechelles and Saint-Just to formulate the new constitution that had been
ordered on October 1 1, 1792. It restored adult male suffrage, and added
the right of every citizen to subsistence, education, and insurrection.
It limited the rights of property by considerations of public interest.
It proclaimed freedom of religious worship, graciously recognized a
Supreme Being, and declared morality to be the indispensable faith of
society. Carlyle, who could not stomach democracy, called this “the most
democratic constitution ever committed to paper.” 31 It was accepted by
the Convention (June 4, 1793), and was ratified by a vote of one fourth
of the electorate, 1 ,80 1 ,9 1 8 to 11,610. This Constitution of 1793
remained on paper only, for on July 10 the Con- vention renewed the
Committee of Public Safety as a ruling power, superior to all
constitutions, till peace should return.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>EXIT MARAT: JULY 1 3, 1 793</li>
</ol>
<p>Three of the Girondin refugees — Petion, Barbaroux, and Buzot — found
protection in Caen, a northern stronghold of the “federalist” reaction
against Parisian domination of the national government. They made
speeches, de- nounced the sansculottes and especially Marat, organized
parades of protest, and planned an army to march upon the capital.</p>
<p>Charlotte Corday was among their most ardent auditors. Descendant of
the dramatist Pierre Corneille, born of a titled, impoverished, strongly
roy- alist family, she was educated in a convent and served two years as
a nun. Somehow she found opportunity to read Plutarch, Rousseau, even
Vol- taire; she lost her faith and thrilled to the heroes of ancient
Rome. She was shocked on hearing that the King had been guillotined, and
she was roused to indignation by the fulminations of Marat against the
Girondins. On June 20, 1793, she visited Barbaroux, then twenty-six and
so handsome that Mme. Roland had likened him to the Emperor Hadrian’s
inamorato An - tinous. Charlotte was nearing her twenty-fifth birthday,
but she had other things than love on her mind. All she asked was a
letter of introduction to a deputy who might arrange her admission to a
meeting of the Convention. Barbaroux gave her a note to Lauze Duperret.
On July 9 she left by stage- coach for Paris. Arriving on July 1 1, she
bought a kitchen knife with a six- inch blade. She planned to enter the
Convention chamber and slay Marat in his seat, but she was informed that
Marat was sick at home. She found his</p>
<p>58 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>address, went there, but was refused admittance; Monsieur was in his
bath. She returned to her room.</p>
<p>The bath was now Marat’s favorite desk. His disease, apparently a
form of scrofula, had worsened; he found relief from it by sitting
immersed to the waist in warm water to which minerals and medicines had
been added; a moist towel was thrown over his shoulders, and a bandana
soaked in vine- gar bound his head. On a board spanning the tub he kept
paper, pen, and ink, and there, day after day, he wrote the material for
his journal. He was cared for by his sister Albertine and, since 1790,
by Simonne fivrard, who began as his servant and, in 1792, became his
common-law wife. He mar- ried her without benefit of clergy, “before the
Supreme Being,… in the vast temple of Nature.” 33</p>
<p>From her room Charlotte sent a note to Marat appealing for an
audience. “I come from Caen. Your love for the nation ought to make you
anxious to know the plots that are being laid there. I await your
reply.” 34 She could not wait. On the evening of July 1 3 she knocked
again at his entrance door. Again she was denied entry, but Marat,
hearing her voice, called to let her in. He received her courteously,
and bade her be seated; she brought her chair up close to him. “What is
going on at Caen?” he asked (or so she later</p>
<p>Marat must have had some good qualities to have won the united love
of two rival women. His sister dedicated her remaining years to
sanctify- ing his memory. Once a prosperous physician, he left at his
death noth- ing more than some scientific manuscripts and twenty-five
sous. 36 He had been a fanatic, but a man fanatically devoted to the
masses whom nature and history had forgotten. The Cordeliers Club
preserved his heart as a sacred relic, and thousands came to view it
with “breathless adoration.” 37 On J all the remaining deputies, and
many men and women from the revolutionary sections, followed his corpse
to its burial in the gardens of the Cordeliers. His statue, carved by
David, was set up in the hall of the Con- vention; and on September 21,
1794, his remains were transferred to the Pantheon.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s trial was short. She acknowledged her deed, but no guilt;
she said she had merely avenged the victims of the September Massacres,
and other objects of Marat’s wrath; “I killed one man to save a hundred
thou - sand.” 38 In a letter to Barbaroux she frankly claimed that “the
end justifies the means.” 39 Within a few hours after her conviction she
was executed on</p>

<p>he Place de la Revolution. She received proudly the curses of the
attending crowd, and rejected the offer of a priest to give her a
religious end. 40 She died before she could realize how fatal her deed
would be to the Girondins whom she had thought to serve. Vergniaud,
speaking for them, realized this, and forgave her: “She has killed us,
but she has taught us how to die.” 41</p>

<li>the “great committee”: 1793</li>
</ol>
<p>The Convention had reserved the right to revise, monthly, the member-
ship of the Committee of Public Safety. On July 10 — his peace policy,
for- eign and domestic, having failed — it removed Danton; then on July
25, as if to show its continuing regard, it elected him its president
for the customary fortnightly term. His first wife had died in February,
leaving him with two young children; on June 17 he had married a girl of
sixteen; by July 10 he was redomesticated.</p>
<p>On July 27 Robespierre was appointed to the Committee. Danton had
never cared for him; “that man,” he said, “has not wits e nough to cook
an egg.” 42 Yet, on August 1, he urged the Convention to give the
Committee</p>
<p>During that summer the “Great Committee,” as it came to be called,
took its historic form. Now it consisted of twelve men: all of the
middle class, all with good education and incomes, all acquainted with
the philosophies and Rousseau; eight of them lawyers, two engineers;
only one of them, Collot d’Herbois, had ever worked with his hands; a
proletarian dictatorship is never proletarian. We call the roll:</p>

<li><p>Bertrand Barere, thirty-eight, added to divers duties the task of
pre- senting and defending before the Convention the decisions reached
by the Committee, and having them confirmed by decrees; amiable and
persuasive, he turned death sentences into eloquence, and statistics
into poetry. He made few surviving enemies, changed with the political
tide, and lived to the age of eighty-six, long enough to learn the
mortality of governments and ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Jean-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne, thirty-seven, argued that the
Catholic Church was the most dangerous enemy of the Revolution, and had
to be destroyed. He kept in touch and tune with the sections and the
Commune, and followed his uncompromising policies with a pertinacity
that made even his fellow committeemen fear him. He took charge of
correspondence and relations with the provinces, headed the new
administrative machinery, and became for a time “the most powerful
member of the Committee.” 44</p></li>
<li><p>Lazare Carnot, forty, already distinguished as a mathematician
and</p></li>

throughout France today.</p>

<li><p>Jean- Marie Collot d’Herbois, forty -three; formerly an actor, he
had suffered the disabilities that oppressed the theatrical profession
before the Revolution; he never forgave the bourgeoisie for closing its
doors to him, or the Church for holding him, by his profession,
excommunicate. He became the most severe of the Twelve in dealing with
the “aristocracy of mer - chants,” and once proposed, as a measure of
economy, that the Paris prisons — crowded with suspects, hoarders, and
profiteers — should be blown up with mines. 45</p></li>
<li><p>Georges Couthon, thirty-eight, was so crippled by meningitis that
he had to be carried in a chair wherever he went; he attributed the
ailment to sexual excesses in his youth, but he was adored by his wife.
He was a man of kind heart and iron will who distinguished himself by
his humane ad- ministration of pivotal provinces during the
Terror.</p></li>
<li><p>Marie-Jean Herault de Sechelles, thirty-four, seemed out of place
and step among the Duodecemvirs; he was a noble of the robe, a wealthy
lawyer, noted for his elegant manners and Voltairean wit. When he felt
the revo- lutionary tide swelling under him he joined in the attack upon
the Bastille, wrote most of the Constitution of 1793, and served as a
rigorous executor of the Committee’s policies in Alsace. He lived
comfortably, and kept a noble mistress, until the guillotine fell upon
him on April 5, 1 794.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Lindet, forty-seven, had charge of food production and

strangest of the Twelve, the most dogmatic, indomitable, and intense,
the enfant ter- rible of the Terror. Brought up in Picardy by his

Saint-Just, rejected all rules, fled to Paris with his mother’s silver,
spent it on prostitutes, 46 was caught and</p>

<p>“When the day comes,” he wrote, “which satisfies me that I cannot
endow the French people with mild, vigorous, and rational ways,
inflexible against tyranny and injustice, on that day I will stab
myself.” 49 In Republican In - stitutions (1791) he argued that the
concentration of wealth made a mock- ery of political and legal equality
and liberty. Private riches must be limited and spread; the government
should be based upon peasant proprietors and independent artisans;
universal education and relief must be provided by the state. Laws
should be fe w, intelligible, and short; “long laws are public
calamities.” 50 After the age of five all boys should be brought up by
the state in spartan simplicity, living on vegetables and trained for
war. Democ- racy is good, but in wartime it should yield to
dictatorship. 51 Elected to the Committee on May 10, 1793, Saint- Just
gave himself resolutely to hard work; he rebutted rumors of his having a
mistress by claiming that he was too busy for such amusements. The
willful and excitable youth became a stern disciplinarian, a capable
organizer, a fearless and victorious general. Returning in triumph to
Paris, he was chosen president of the Convention (February 19, 1794).
Proud and confident, overbearing to others, he humbly accepted the
leadership of Robespierre, defended him in his defeat, and — aged
twenty-six years and eleven months — accompanied him to death.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Robespierre did not quite replace Danton as the master mind or will
of the Twelve; Carnot, Billaud, Collot were too tough to be ruled;
Robes- pierre never became dictator. He worked by patient study and
devious strategy rather than by open command. He maintained popularity
with the sansculottes by living simply with plain folk, extolling the
masses and de- fending their interests. On April 4, 1793, he had offered
the Convention “A Proposed Declaration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen”:</li>
</ol>
<p>Society is obliged to provide for the subsistence of all its members,
either by procuring work for them or by assuring the means of existence
to those who are unable to work…. The aid indispensable to whoever lacks
necessaries is a debt of whoever possesses a surplus…. To make
resistance to oppression subject to legal forms is the last refinement
of tyranny…. Every institution that does not assume that the people are
good, and that the magistrates are corruptible, is vicious…. The men of
all countries are brothers. 52</p>
<p>All in all these twelve men were not mere murderers, as superficial
ac- quaintance might describe them. It is true that they followed too
readily the tradition of violence that had come down to them from the
wars of religion and the Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Eve ( 1572) ;
most of them learned to execute their enemies without qualm, sometimes
with virtuous satisfaction; but they claimed the needs and customs of
war. They themselves were sub- ject to these mishaps; any one of them
could be challenged, deposed, and sent to the guillotine; several ended
so. At any moment they were subject to insur- rection by the Paris
populace, or the National Guard, or an ambitious gen- eral; any major
defeat on the front or in a rebellious province might topple them.
Meanwhile they labored night and day on their various tasks: from eight
in the morning till noon in their offices or subcommittees; from one to
four in the afternoon in attending the Convention; from eight till late
in the</p>

<p>evening in consultation or debate around the green table in their
conference room. When they took charge France was torn with civil war by
emergent capitalism in Lyons, by Girondin uprisings in the south, by
Catholic and royalist revolts in the west; it was threatened by foreign
armies in the north- east, the east, and the southwest; it was suffering
defeat on land and sea, and was blockaded in every port. When the Great
Committee fell, France had been hammered into political unity by
dictatorship and terror; a new breed of young generals, trained, and
sometimes led into battle, by Carnot and Saint-Just, had thrown back the
enemy in decisive victories; and France, alone against nearly all of
Europe, had emerged triumphant against every- thing but herself.</p>
<p>V. THE REIGN OF TERROR: SEPTEMBER 1 7, 1793-JULY 28, 1 794</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Gods Are Athirst</li>
</ol>
<p>The Terror was a recurrent mood as well as a specific time. Strictly
it should be dated from the Law of Suspects, September 17, 1793, to the
exe- cution of Robespierre, July 28, 1794. But there had been the
September Terror of 1792; there was to be a “White Terror” in May, 1795;
another terror would follow the fall of Napoleon.</p>
<p>The causes of the famous Terror were external danger and internal
dis- order, leading to public fear and tumult, and begetting martial
law. The First Coalition had retaken Mainz (July 23), had invaded
Alsace, and had entered Valenciennes, a hundred miles from Paris;
Spanish troops had cap- tured Perpignan and Bayonne. French armies were
in disarray, French gen- erals were ignoring the orders of their
government. On August 29 French royalists surrendered to the British a
French fleet, and a precious naval base and arsenal at Toulon. Britannia
ruled the waves, and could at leisure ap- propriate French colonies on
three continents. The victorious Allies debated the dismemberment of
France, and restored feudal rights as they advanced. 53</p>
<p>Internally the Revolution seemed to be breaking apart. The Vendee was
aflame with counterrevolutionary ardor; Catholic rebels had defeated the
forces of the state at Vihiers (July 18). Aristocrats, at home or as
emigres , were confidently planning restoration. Lyons, Bourges, Nimes,
Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, Brest fell to the revolting Gironde. Class
war was rising between rich and poor.</p>
<p>The economy was itself a battlefield. The price controls established
on May 4 and September 29 were being defeated by the ingenuity of greed.
The urban poor approved the maxima; the peasants and the merchants op-
posed them, and increasingly refused to grow or distribute the
price-limited foods; the city stores, receiving less and less produce
from market or field, could satisfy only the foremost few in the queues
that daily formed at their doors. Fear of famine ran through Paris and
the towns. In Paris, Senlis, Amiens, Rouen the populace came near to
overthrowing the government in</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>protest against the shortage of food. On June 25 Jacques Roux led his
band of Enrages to the Convention and demanded that all profiteers —
among whom he included some deputies — be arrested and made to disgorge
their new wealth.</p>
<p>Yours is no democracy, for you permit riches. It is the rich who have
reaped, in the last four years, the fruits of the Revolution; it is the
merchant aristoc- racy, more terrible than the nobility, that oppresses
us. We see no limit to their extortions, for the price of goods is
growing alarmingly. It is time that the death struggle between the
profiteers and the workers should come to an end…. Are the possessions
of knaves to be more sacred than human life? The necessities of life
should be available for distribution by administrative bodies, just as
the armed forces are at their disposition. [Nor would it suffice to take
a capital levy from the rich, so long as the system is unchanged, for]
the capitalist and the merchant will the next day raise an equal sum
from the sansculottes… if the monopolies and the power of extortion are
not de- stroyed. 54</p>
<p>In slightly less communistic terms Jacques Hebert denounced the bour-
geoisie as traitors to the Revolution, and urged the workers to seize
power from a negligent or cowardly government. On August 30 a deputy
pro- nounced the magic word: Let Terror be the order of the day. 55 On
Septem- ber 5 a crowd from the sections, calling for “war on tyrants,
hoarders, and aristocrats,” marched to the headquarters of the Commune
in the Hotel de Ville. The mayor, Jean-Guillaume Pache, and the city
procurator, Pierre Chaumette, went with their delegation to the
Convention and voiced their demand for a revolutionary army to tour
France with a portable guillotine, arrest every Girondin, and compel
every peasant to surrender his hoarded produce or be executed on the
spot. 56</p>
<p>It was in this atmosphere of foreign invasion, and of a revolution
within the Revolution, that the Committee of Public Safety built and
guided the armies that led France to victory, and the machinery of
terror that forged a distraught nation into unity.</p>
<p>On August 23, on bold plans presented by Carnot and Barere, the Con-
vention ordered a levy en masse unparalleled in French history:</p>
<p>From now until such time as its enemies have been driven out of the
terri- tory of the Republic, all Frenchmen are permanently requisitioned
for the service of the armies. The young shall go and fight, the married
men shall forge weapons and transport food, the women shall make tents
and clothes and serve in the hospitals, the old men shall have
themselves carried into public places to rouse the courage of the
warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the nation.</p>
<p>All unmarried men from eighteen to twenty-five years of age were to
be drafted into battalions under banners reading: u Le peuple frangais
debout contre les tyrants /” (The French people standing up against the
tyrants! ).</p>
<p>Soon Paris was transformed into a throbbing arsenal. The gardens of
the Tuileries and the Luxembourg were covered with shops producing,
among other materiel, some 650 muskets a day. Unemployment vanished.
Privately owned weapons, metal, surplus clothing, were requisitioned;
thousands of</p>
<p>6 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>mills were taken over. Capital as well as labor was conscripted; a
loan of a billion livres was squeezed from the well-to-do. Contractors
were told what to produce; prices were fixed by the government.
Overnight, France became a totalitarian state. Copper, iron, saltpeter,
potash, soda, sulfur, formerly de- pendent in part on imports, had now
to be found in, taken from, the soil of a France blockaded on every
frontier and at every port. Luckily the great chemist Lavoisier (soon to
be guillotined) had in 1775 improved the quality, and increased the
production, of gunpowder; the French armies had better gunpowder than
their enemies. Scientists like Monge, Berthollet, and Four- croy were
called upon to find supplies of needed materials, or to invent sub-
stitutes; they were at the head of their fields at’the time, and served
their country well.</p>
<p>By the end of September France had 500,000 men under arms. Their
equipment was still inadequate, their discipline poor, their spirit
hesitant; only saints can be enthusiastic about death. Now for the first
time propa- ganda became a state industry, almost a monopoly;
Jean-Baptiste Bour- chotte, minister of war, paid newspapers to present
the nation’s case, and saw to it that copies of these journals were
circulated in the army camps, where there was little else to read.
Members or representatives of the Com- mittee went to the front to
harangue the troops and keep an eye upon the generals. In the first
important engagement of the new campaign — at Hond- schoote September
6-8, against a force of British and Austrians — it was Debrel, a
Committtee commissioner, who turned defeat into victory after General
Houchard had proposed retreat. For this and other errors the old soldier
was sent to the guillotine on November 14, 1793. Twenty-two other
generals, nearly all of the Ancien Regime, were imprisoned for blunders,
or apathy, or neglect of the Committee’s instructions. Younger men,
brought up in revolution, took their places — men like Hoche, Pichegru,
Jourdan, Moreau, who had the viscera to apply Carnot’s policy of
persistent attack.</p>
<p>On September 17 the obedient Convention passed the Law of Suspects,
empowering the Committee or its agents to arrest, without warning, any
returned emigre, any relative of an emigre, any public official
suspended and not reinstated, anyone who had given any sign of
opposition to the</p>
<p>Revolution or the war. It was a harsh law, which forced all but
avowed revolutionists — therefore nearly all Catholics and bourgeois —
to live in con- stant fear of arrest, even of death; the Committee
justified it as needed to maintain at least an outward unity in a war
for national survival. Some emigres agreed with the Twelve that fear and
terror were legitimate instru- ments of rule in critical situations. The
Comte de Montmorin, former for- eign minister under Louis XVI, wrote in
1792: “I believe it necessary to punish the Parisians by terrorism.” The
Comte de Flachsl ander argued that</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>6 5</p>
<p>French resistance to the Allies would “continue until the Convention
has been massacred.” A secretary to the King of Prussia commented on the
emigres : “Their language is horrible. If we are pre pared to abandon
their fellow citizens to their vengeance, France would soon be no more
than one monstrous cemetery.” 67</p>
<p>The Convention faced a choice between terror and mercy in the case of
the Queen. Putting aside her early extravagance, her intrusion into
affairs of state, her known distaste for the populace of Paris (offenses
that hardly deserved decapitation), there was no doubt that she had
communicated with emigres and foreign governments in an effort to halt
the Revolution and re- store the traditional powers of the French
monarchy. In these operations she felt that she was using the human
right of self-defense; her accusers consid- ered that she had violated
laws passed by the elected delegates of the nation, and had committed
treason. Apparently she had revealed to the enemies of France the
intimate deliberations of the royal Council, even the campaign plans of
the Revolutionary armies.</p>
<p>She had borne four children to Louis XVI: a daughter, Marie-Therese,
now fifteen; a son who had died in infancy; a second son, who had died
in 1789; a third son, Louis-Charles, now eight, whom she considered to
be Louis XVII. Helped by her daughter and her sister-in-law Elisabeth,
she watched in anxiety and then despair as continued confinement broke
the health and spirit of the boy. In March, 1793, she was offered a plan
for her escape; she refused it because it required her to leave her
children behind. 68 When the government learned of the abandoned plot it
removed the Dau- phin from his mother despite her struggles, and kept
him in isolation from his relatives. On August 2, 1793, after a year of
imprisonment in the Tem- ple, the Queen, her daughter, and her
sister-in-law were removed to a room in the Conciergerie — that part of
the Palais de Justice which had formerly been occupied by the
superintendent of the building. There the “Widow Capet,” as she was
called, was treated more kindly than before, even to hav - ing a priest
come and say Mass in her cell. Later that month she consented to another
attempt to escape; it failed; now she was transferred to another room
and put under stricter guard.</p>
<p>On September 2 the Committee met to decide her fate. Some members
were in favor of keeping her alive as a pawn to be surrendered to
Austria in return for an acceptable peace. Barere and Saint-Andre called
for her exe- cution as a means of uniting the signers of the sentence
with a bond of blood. Hebert, from the Commu ne, told the Twelve, “I
have in your name promised the head of Antoinette to the sansculottes,
who are clamoring for it, and without whose support you yourselves would
cease to exist…. I will go and cut it off myself if I have to wait much
longer for it.” 69</p>
<p>On October 12 the Queen submitted to a long preliminary examination;
and on October 14 and 15 she was tried before the Revolutionary
Tribunal, with Fouquier-Tinville as chief prosecutor. She was questioned
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and from 5 to 1 1 p.m. on the first day, and from
9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the next. She was accused of transferring millions
of francs from the</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>French Treasury to her brother Joseph II of Austria, and with
inviting alien forces to invade France; and it was suggested, for good
measure, that she had tried to “corrupt” her son sexually. Only the last
accusation unnerved her; she replied, “Nature refuses to answer such a
charge brought against a mother. I appeal to all mothers here.” The
audience was moved by the sight of this woman, whose youthful beauty and
gaiety had been the talk of Europe, now white-haired at thirty-eight,
clad in mourning for her hus- band, fighting for her life with courage
and dignity against men who were apparently resolved to break her spirit
with a protracted ordeal merciless to both body and mind. When it was
over she was blind with fatigue, and had to be helped to her cell. There
she learned that the verdict was death.</p>
<p>Now in solitary confinement, she wrote a letter of farewell to Madame
Elisabeth, asking her to transmit to her son and daughter the directions
the King had left for them. “My son,” she wrote, “must never forget his
father’s last words, which I expressly repeat to him: ‘Never seek to
avenge my death.’” 60 The letter was not delivered to Madame Elisabeth;
it was inter - cepted by Fouquier-Tinville, who gave it to Robespierre,
among whose secret papers it was found after his death.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 16, 1793, the executioner, Henri Sanson,
came to her cell, bound her hands behind her back, and cut off her hair
at the neck. She was taken in a cart along a street lined with soldiers,
past hos- tile, taunting crowds, to the Place de la Revolution. At noon
Sanson held up her severed head to the multitude.</p>
<p>Having struck its stride, the Revolutionary Tribunal now issued death
sentences at the rate of seven per day. 61 All available aristocrats
were seized, and many were executed. The twenty-one Girondins who had
been un- der guard since June 2 were put on trial on October 24; the
eloquence of Vergniaud and Brissot availed them not; all were granted a
quick and early death. One of them, Valaze, stabbed himself as he left
the court; his dead body was placed among the condemned and carted to
the scaffold, where it took its turn under the indifferent blade. “The
Revolution,” said Vergniaud, “is like Saturn, it is devouring its own
children.” 62</p>
<p>Consider the wrath and fear that these events must have brought to
Manon Roland, now awaiting her fate in the Conciergerie, which had
become a steppingstone to the guillotine. Her imprisonment had had some
amenities; friends brought her books and flowers; she collected in her
cell a little library centered around Plutarch and Tacitus. As a
stronger anodyne she immersed herself in writing her recollections,
terming them an Appel 4 rimpartiale posterite — zs if posterity too
would not be divided. As she de- scribed her youth the remembrance of
tempi felici made bitterer her con- templation of present days. So she
wrote, on August 28, 1793:</p>
<p>I feel my resolution to pursue these memories deserting me. The
miseries of my country torment me; an involuntary gloom penetrates my
soul, chilling my imagination. France has become a vast Golgotha of
carnage, an arena of hor- rors, where her children tear and destroy one
another…. Never can history</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) THE CONVENTION 67</p>
<p>paint these dreadful times, or the monsters that fill them with their
barbarities…. What Rome or Babylon ever equaled Paris ? 83</p>
<p>Foreseeing that her turn would come soon, she wrote into her
manuscript a word of farewell to her husband and to her lover, who had
as yet escaped the snares prepared for them:</p>
<p>O my friends, may propitious fate conduct you to the United States,
the sole asylum of freedom.*… And you, my spouse and companion,
enfeebled by premature old age, eluding with difficulty the assassins,
shall I be permitted to see you again?… How long must I remain a witness
to the desolation of my native land, the degradation of my countrymen ?
84</p>
<p>Not long. On November 8, 1793, before the Revolutionary Tribunal, she
was charged with complicity in Roland’s alleged misuse of public funds,
and with having sent from her cell letters of encouragement to Barbaroux
and Buzot, who were then inciting revolt against the Jacobin control
over the Convention. When she spoke in her own defense the carefully
selected spectators denounced her as a traitress. She was declared
guilty and was guillotined on the same day in the Place de la
Revolution. An uncertain tra- dition tells how, looking at the statue of
Liberty that David had set up in the majestic square, she cried out, “O
Liberty, what crimes are committed in your name!” 05</p>
<p>A procession of revolutionaries followed her. On November 10 came the
mayor-astronomer Bailly, who had given the red cockade to the King, and
had ordered the National Guard to fire upon the untimely petitioners on
the Champ-de-Mars. On November 1 2 the guillotine caught up with
Philippe figalite; he could not make out why the Montagnards wished to
dispatch so faithful an ally; but he had the blood of kings in his
veins, and had itched for a throne; who could tell when that itch would
frenzy him again? Then, on November 29, Antoine Barnave, who had tried
to protect and guide the Queen. Then Generals Custine, Houchard,
Biron…</p>
<p>Roland, having thanked the friends who had risked their lives to
protect him, set out alone on a walk, November 16, sat down against a
tree, and wrote a note of farewell: “Not fear but indignation mad e me
quit my retreat, on learning that my wife had been murdered. I did not
wish to re- main longer on an earth polluted with crimes.” 66 Then he
forced his sword into his body. Condorcet, after writing a paean to
progress, took poison (March 28, 1794). Barbaroux shot himself,
survived, and was guillotined (June 15). Petion and Buzot, pursued by
agents of the government, killed themselves in a field near Bordeaux.
Their bodies were found on June 18, half devoured by wolves.</p>

<p>wiped out, the Jacobins felt, if their moves toward provincial
autonomy were to be overcome and France made one and Jacobin. For this
and other purposes the Committee of Public Safety sent out over France
its “repre - sentatives on mission,” and gave them, subject to itself,
almost absolute au - thority in their allotted terrain. They might
depose elected officials, appoint others, arrest suspects, draft men for
the Army, levy taxes, enforce price controls, exact loans, requisition
produce, clothing, or materials, and set up or confirm local committees
of public safety to serve as agencies of the Great Committee in Paris.
The representatives accomplished miracles of revolutionary and military
organization, often amid a hostile or apathetic environment. They put
down opposition without mercy, sometimes with enthusiastic excess.</p>
<p>The most successful of them was Saint-Just. On October 17, 1793, he
and Joseph Lebas (who gladly let him take the lead) were dispatched to
save Alsace from an Austrian invasion that was making rapid conquests in
a ter- ritory congenitally German by language, literature, and ways. The
French Army of the Rhine had been thrown back upon Strasbourg, and was
in a mood of defeatism and mutiny. Saint-Just learned that the troops
had been tyrannically treated, badly led, and perhaps betrayed, by
officers inadequately enamored of the Revolution; he had seven of them
executed before the as- sembled force. He listened to grievances, and
remedied them with character- istic decisiveness. He requisitioned from
the prosperous classes all surplus shoes, coats, overcoats, and hats,
and from the 193 richest citizens he ex- tracted nine million livres.
Incompetent or apathetic officials were dismissed; convicted grafters
were shot. When the French army met the Austrians again the invaders
were driven out of Alsace, and the province was restored to French
control. Saint-Just returned to Paris, eager for other tasks, and almost
forgetting that he was engaged to the sister of Lebas.</p>
<p>Joseph Le Bon did not live up to his name as Committee
representative. Warned by his employers to beware of “false and mistaken
humanity,” the blue-eyed ex- cure thought to please them by “shortening”
150 Cambrai - tortions of the dying to amuse his wife. 67 He himself was
cut short in 1795.</p>
<p>In July, 1793, Jean-Baptiste Carrier was commissioned to suppress the
Catholic revolt in the Vendee, and to make Nantes secure against further
rebellion. Herault de Sechelles, of the Committee, explained to him, “We
can become humane when we are certain of victory.” 68 Carrier was
inspired. In a moment of ecological enthusiasm he declared that France
could not feed its rapidly growing population, and that it would be
desirable to cure the excess by cutting down all nobles, priests,
merchants, and magistrates. At Nantes he objected to trial as a waste of
time; all these suspects (he com- manded the judge) “must be eliminated
in a couple of hours, or I will have you and your colleagues shot.” 69
Since the prisons at Nantes were crowded almost to asphyxiation by those
arrested and condemned, and there was a shortage of food, he ordered his
aides to fill barges, rafts, and other craft</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>with fifteen hundred men, women and children — giving priority to
priests — and to have these vessels scuttled in the Loire. By this and
other means he disposed of four thousand undesirables in four months. 70
He justified him- self by what seemed to him the laws of war; the
Vendeans were in revolt, and every one of them would remain an enemy of
the Revolution till death. “We will make France a graveyard,” he vowed,
“rather than not regenerate</p>
<p>S tanislas Freron (son of Voltaire’s favorite enemy) and other agents
of the Committee rouged the Rhone and the Var with the blood of the
uncon- verted: 120 at Marseilles, 282 at Toulon, 332 at Orange. 72 By
contrast Georges Couthon was the quality of mercy on his mission to
gather re- cruits for the Army in the department of Puy-de-Dome. At
Clermont- Ferrand he reorganized the industries into concentration on
the production of materiel for the new regiments. When the citizens saw
that he wielded his authority with justice and humanity they became so
fond of him that they took turns in carrying him in his chair. During
his mission not one per- son was executed by “revolutionary justice.”
73</p>
<p>Joseph Fouche, once a professor of Latin and physics, was now
thirty-four years old, not yet Balzac’s “ablest man I’ve ever met.” 74
He seemed made for intrigue: lean, angular, tight-lipped, sharp of eye
and nose, sober, secret, silent, tough; he was to rival Talleyrand in
rapid transformations and devi- ous survivals. To outward observances he
was a dutiful family man, as mod- est in his habits as he was bold in
his ideas. In 1792 he was elected to the Convention from Nantes. At
first he sat and voted with the Gironde; then, foreseeing its fall and
the supremacy of Paris, he moved up to the Mountain and issued a
pamphlet calling upon the Revolution to pass from its bourgeois to a
proletarian phase. To advance the war, he argued, the government should
“take everything beyond what a citizen needs; for superfluity is an
obvious and gratuitous violation of the rights of the people.” All gold
and silver should be confiscated until the war ended. “We shall be harsh

<p>Lyons was almost the capital of French capitalism. Among its 130,000
souls were financiers with connections all over France, merchants
having</p>
<p>?o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>outlets all over Europe, captains of industry controlling a hundred
factories, and a large body of proletaires who heard with envy how their
own class in Paris had almost captured the government. At the beginning
of 1793, under the leadership of the ex-priest Marie-Joseph Chalier,
they achieved a similar victory. But religion proved stronger than
class. At least half the workers were still Catholic, and resented the
anti-Christian turn of Jacobin policy; when the bourgeoisie mobilized
its diverse forces against the proletarian dic- tatorship, the workers
divided, and a coalition of businessmen, royalists, and Girondins
expelled the radical government and put to death Chalier and two hundred
of his followers (July 16, 1793). Thousands of workingmen left the city,
settled in the environs, and waited for the next turn of the
Revolutionary screw.</p>
<p>The Committee of Public Safety sent an army to overthrow the
victorious capitalists. Couthon, legless, came from Clermont to lead it;
on October 9 it forced its way in, and reestablished Jacobin rule.
Couthon thought a policy of mercy advisable in a city whose population
so largely depended upon continued operation of the factories and the
shops, but the Paris Com- mittee thought otherwise. On October 12 it put
through the Convention, and sent to Couthon, a directive composed by
Robespierre in a fury of re- venge for Chalier and the two hundred
executed radicals. It read in part: “The city of Lyons shall be
destroyed. Every habitation of the rich shall be demolished…. The name
of Lyons shall be effaced from the list of the Republic’s cities. The
collection of houses left standing shall henceforth</p>
<p>Couthon did not relish the operation here assigned him. He condemned
one of the more expensive dwellings to demolition, and then was borne
off to more congenial labors at Clermont-Ferrand. He was replaced at
Lyons (November 4) by Collot d’Herbois, who was soon joined by Fouche.
They began with a mock-religious ceremony in commemoration of Chalier as
the “savior - god who had died for the people”; leading the procession
was a donkey garbed as a bishop bearing a miter on his head and dragging
a cruci- fix and a Bible on his tail; in a public square the martyr was
honored by eulogies, and a bonfire was made of the Bible, a missal,
sacramental wafers, and wooden images of sundry saints. 77 For the
revolutionary purification of Lyons Collot and Fouche created a
“Temporary Commission” of twenty members, and a tribunal of seven to try
suspects. The commission issued a declaration of principles which has
been called “the first communist mani - festo” of modem times. 78 It
proposed to ally the Revolution with the “im - mense class of the poor”;
it denounced nobility and bourgeoisie, and told the workers: “You have
been oppressed; you must crush your oppressors!” All products of French
soil belonged to France; all private wealth must be put at the service
of the Republic; and as a first step toward social justice a tax of
thirty thousand livres must be taken from anyone having an income</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>7 1</p>
<p>of ten thousand per year. Large sums were raised by jailing nobles,
priests, and others, and confiscating their property.</p>
<p>This declaration was not well received by the people of Lyons, a
consid- erable minority of whom had risen into the middle class. On
November io a petition signed by ten thousand women recommended mercy
for the thousands of men and women who had been crowded into the jails.
The commissioners r eplied sternly, “Shut yourselves up in the privacy
of your household tasks…. Let us see no more of the tears that dishonor
you.” 79 On December 4, perhaps to make matters clear, sixty prisoners,
condemned by the new tribunal, were marched out to an open space across
the Rhone, were stationed between two trenches, and were buried by
successive mitraillades — showers of slugs or grapeshot from a row of
cannon. On the next day, at the same spot, 209 prisoners, tied together,
were mowed down by a similar mitraillade; and on December 7 two hundred
more. Thereafter the slaughter proceeded more leisurely by guillotine,
yet so rapidly that the stench of the dead began to poison the city air.
By March, 1794, the execu- tions in Lyons had reached 1,667 — two thirds
of them of the middle or upper class. 80 Hundreds of expensive homes
were laboriously destroyed. 81</p>
<p>On December 20, 1793, a deputation of citizens from Lyons appeared
before the Convention to ask for an end to the vengeance; but Collot had
beaten them to Paris, and successfully defended his policy. Fouche, left
in charge of Lyons, continued the Terror. Learning that Toulon had been
re- captured, he wrote to Collot: “We have only one way of celebrating
vic - tory. This evening we se nd 2 1 3 rebels under the fire of the
lightning bolt.” 82 On April 3, 1794, Fouche was recalled to give an
account of himself before the Convention. He escaped punishment, but
never forgave Robespierre for accusing him of barbarity; someday he
would take his revenge.</p>
<p>The Committee of Public Safety slowly recognized that the provincial
Terror had been carried to a costly excess. In this matter Robespierre
was a moderating influence; he took the lead in recalling Carrier,
Freron, Tallien, and requiring an accounting of their operations. The
provincial Terror ended in May, 1794, while it was being intensified in
Paris. By the time Robespierre himself had become its victim (July
27-28, 1794) it had taken 2,700 lives in Paris, 18,000 in France; 83
other guessers raise the total to 4o,ooo. 84 Those jailed as suspects
amounted to some 300,000. As the prop- erty of the executed reverted to
the state, it was a profitable Terror.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The War Against Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the deepest division was between those who treasured religious
faith as their final support in a world otherwise unintelligible,
meaningless, and tragic and those who had come to think of religion as a
managed and costly superstition blocking the road to reason and liberty.
This division was deepest in the Vendee — coastal France between the
Loire and La Rochelle — where the dour weather, the rocky, arid soil,
the repetitious trajectory of</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>births and deaths, left the population almost immune to the wit of
Voltaire and the winds of the Enlightenment. Townsmen and peasants
accepted the Revolution; but when the Constituent Assembly promulgated
the Civil Con- stitution of the Clergy — confiscating the property of
the Church, m akin g all priests the employees of the state, and
requiring them to swear fidelity to the regime that had shorn them — the
peasants supported their priests in re- fusing assent. The call to their
youth to volunteer, or be conscripted, for the Army set fire to the
revolt; why should these boys gives their lives to protect an infidel
government rather than their priests and altars and house- hold
gods?</p>
<p>So, on March 4, 1793, rioting broke out in the Vendee; nine days
later it had spread throughout the region; by May 1 there were thirty
thousand rebels under arms. Several royalist nobles joined the rural
leaders in turning these recruits into disciplined troops; before the
Convention realized their strength they had taken Thouars, Fontenay,
Saumur, Angers. In August the Committee of Public Safety sent into the
Vendee an army under General Kleber, with instructions to destroy the
peasant forces and devastate all regions supporting them. Kleber
defeated the Catholic army at Cholet on October 17, and crushed it at
Savenay on December 23. Military commis- sions from Paris were set up in
Angers, Nantes, Rennes, and Tours, with orders to put to death any
Vendean bearing arms; at or near Angers 463 men were shot in twenty
days. Before the Vendeans were subdued by Mar- shal Hoche (July, 1796),
half a million lives had been lost in this new re- ligious war.</p>
<p>In Paris much of the population had become indifferent to religion.
In this regard there had been a frail accord between the Mountain and
the Gironde; they had joined in reducing the power of the clergy, and in
estab- lishing a pagan calendar. They had encouraged the marriage of
priests, even to decreeing deportation for any bishop who had tried to
prevent it. Under protection of the Revolution some two thousand priests
and five hundred nuns took mates. 85</p>
<p>The Committee’s representatives on mission usually made. de
-Christianiza- tion a special element in their procedure. One ordered a
priest imprisoned until he married. At Nevers, Fouche issued rigorous
rules for the clergy: they must marry, must live simply like the
Apostles, must not wear clerical dress, or perform religious ceremonies,
outside their churches; Christian fu- neral services were abolished, and
cemeteries must display an inscription telling the public that “death is
an eternal sleep.” He prevailed upon an archbishop and thirty priests to
throw away their cowls and don the red cap of revolution. In Moulins he
rode at the head of a procession in which he smashed all crosses,
crucifixes, and religious images en route. 86 In Clermont- Ferrand
Couthon proclaimed that the religion of Christ had been turned into a
financial imposture. By hiring a physician to make tests before the
public , he showed that the “blood of Christ” in a miracle -producing
phial was merely colored turpentine. He ended the state payment of
priests, con- fiscated the gold and silver vessels of the churches, and
announced that</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>churches that could not be transformed into schools might with his
ap- proval be torn down to build houses for the poor. He proclaimed a
new theology in which Nature would be God, and heaven would be an
earthly utopia in which all men would be good. 87</p>
<p>The leaders of the campaign against Christianity were Hebert of the
Paris City Council and Chaumette of the Paris Commune. Warmed by Chau-
mette’s oratory and Hebert’s journalism, a crowd of sansculottes invade
d the Abbey of St.-Denis on October 16, 1793, emptied the coffins of
French royalty there entombed, and melted the metal for use in the war.
On No- vember 6 the Convention accorded the communes of France the right
to officially renounce the Christian Church. On November 10 men and
women from the working-class quarters and the ideological haunts of
Paris paraded through the streets in mock religious dress and
procession; they entered the hall of the Convention and prevailed upon
the deputies to pledge attendance at that evening’s fete in the
Cathedral of Notre -Dame — renamed the Temple of Reason. There a new
sanctuary had been arranged, in which Mile. Can- deille of the Opera,
robed in a tricolor flag and crowned with a red cap, stood as the
Goddess of Liberty, attended by persuasive ladies who sang a “Hymn to
Liberty” composed for the occasion by Marie -Joseph de Chenier. The
worshipers danced and sang in the naves, while in the side chapels, said
hostile reporters, profiteers of freedom celebrated the rites of love.
88 On No- vember 17 Jean-Baptiste Gobel, bishop of Paris, yielding to
popular de- mand, appeared before the Convention, abjured his office,
handed over to the president his episcopal crozier and ring, and donned
the red cap of freedom. 89 On November 23 the Commune ordered all
Christian churches in Paris closed. 90</p>
<p>The Convention, on second thought, wondered had it not overplayed its
anti-Christian hand. The deputies were nearly all agnostics, pantheists,
or atheists, but several of them questioned the wisdom of infuriating
sincere Catholics, who were still in the majority, and many of them
ready to take up arms against the Revolution. Some, like Robespierre and
Carnot, felt that religion was the only force that could prevent
repeated social upheavals against inequalities too deeply rooted in
nature to be removed by legislation. Robespierre believed that
Catholicism was an organized exploitation of superstition, 91 but he
rejected atheism as an immodest assumption of impos- sible knowledge. On
May 8, 1793, he had condemned the philosophes as hypocrites who scorned
the commonalty and angled for pensions from kings. On November 21, at
the height of the de-Christianizing festivities, he told the
Convention:</p>
<p>Every philosopher and every individual may adopt whatever opinion he
pleases about atheism. Anyone who wishes to make such an opinion a crime
is absurd, but the public man or the legislator who should adopt such a
system would be a hundred times more foolish still….</p>
<p>Atheism is aristocratic. The idea of a great Being who watches over
op- pressed innocence and punishes triumphant crime is essentially the
idea of the people. This is the sentiment of Europe and the world; it is
the sentiment of</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>he French people. That notion is attached neither to priests nor to
supersti- tion nor to ceremonies; it is attached only to the idea of an
incomprehensible Power, the terror of wrongdoers, the stay and comfort
of virtue. 92</p>
<p>Danton here agreed with Robespierre: “We never intended to annihilate
the reign of superstition in order to set up the reign of atheism…. I
demand that there be an end of those antireligious masquerades in the
Conven- tion.” 93</p>
<p>On December 6, 1793, the Convention reaffirmed freedom of worship,
and guaranteed the protection of religious ceremonies conducted by loyal
priests. Hebert protested that he too rejected atheism, but he joined
the forces that aimed to reduce Robespierre’s popularity. Robespierre
saw him now as a major enemy, and waited for a chance to destroy
him.*</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Revolution Eats Its Children</li>
</ol>
<p>Hebert’s strength lay in the sansculottes, who might be marshaled
through the sections and the radical press to invade the Convention and
restore the rule of Paris over France. Robespierre’s strength, formerly
based in the Parisian populace, now lay in the Committee of Public
Safety, which domi- nated the Convention through superior facilities for
information, decision, and action.</p>
<p>In November, 1793, the Committee was at the peak of its repute,
partly because of the successful levy en masse, but especially because
of military triumphs on several fronts. The new generals — Jour dan,
Kellermann, Kleber, Hoche, Pichegru — were sons of the Revolution,
untrammeled by old rules and tactics or faded loyalties; they had under
their command a million men still inadequately armed and trained but
roused to valor by the thought of what might happen to them and their
families if the enemy should break through the French lines. They were
checked at Kaiserslautern, but they recovered and took Landau and
Speyer. They drove the Spaniards back over the Pyrenees. And, with the
help of the young Napoleon, they recap- tured Toulon.</p>
<p>Since August 26 a motley force of English, Spanish, and
Neapolitan</p>
<p>roops, protected by an Anglo-Spanish fleet and abetted by local
conserva- tives, had held that port and arsenal, strategically located
on the Mediter- ranean. For three months a revolutionary army had laid
siege to it, to no avail. A promontory, Cap l’Aiguillette, divided the
harbor and overlooked the arsenal; to gain that point would be to
command the situation; but the British had blocked the land approach to
the cape with a fort so strongly armed that they called it Little
Gibraltar. Bonaparte, aged twenty-four, saw at once that if the hostile
squadron could be forced to leave the harbor, the</p>

<p>occupying garrison, losing supplies from the sea, would have to
abandon the town. By resolute and risky reconnoitering he found, in the
jungle, a place from which his artillery could with some safety bombard
the bastion. When his cannon had demolished its walls a battalion of
French troops stormed the fort, slew its defenders, captured or replaced
its guns. These were brought into action upon the enemy fleet; Lord Hood
ordered the garrison to abandon the city, and his ships to depart; and
on December 19, 1793, the French Army restored Toulon to France.
Augustin Robespierre, the local representative of the Committee, wrote
to his brother praising the “tran - scendent merit” of the young
artillery captain. A new epic began.</p>
<p>These victories, and those of Kleber in the Vendee, freed the
Committee to deal with internal problems. There was an allegedly
“foreign plot” to assassinate the revolutionary leaders, but no
convincing evidence was found. Corruption was spreading in the
production and delivery of army supplies; “in the Army of the South
there are thirty thousand pairs of breeches want - ing — a most
scandalous want.” 95 Speculation was helping market manipula - tion to
run up the prices of goods. A governmental maximum had been set for the
prices of important products, but producers complained that they could
not keep to these prices if wages were not similarly controlled. Infla-
tion was checked for a time, but peasants, manufacturers, and merchants
cut down production, and unemployment increased while prices rose. As
sup- plies ran low, housewives had to stand in one line after another
for bread, milk, meat, butter, oil, soap, candles, and wood. Queues
formed as early as midnight; men and women lay in doorways or on the
pavement while wait- ing for the shop to open and the procession to
move. Here and there hungry prostitutes offered their wares along the
line. 96 In many cases strong-arm groups invaded the stores and marched
away with the goods. Municipal services broke down; crime flourished;
police were scarce; uncollected refuse strewed and fouled the streets.
Like conditions harassed Rouen, Lyons, Mar- seilles, Bordeaux…</p>
<p>Arguing that the Committee had mismanaged the economy, and that
profiteers had seized the ship of state, the sansculottes of Paris, who
had been the mainstay of Robespierre, transferred their support to
Hebert and Chau- mette, and listened avidly to proposals for the
nationalization of all property, all wealth, or at least all land. One
section leader proposed to cure economic distress by putting all rich
people to death. 97 By 1794 it was a common com- plaint, among
workingmen, that the bourgeoisie had walked off with the Revolution.</p>
<p>Toward the end of ’93 new challenges to the Committee came from a
powerful revolutionary leader and a brilliant journalist. Despite the
pre- tended ferocity of Danton there was in him an amiable streak that
winced at the execution of the Queen and the violence of the Terror. On
his return from Arcis he judged that the expulsion of invaders from the
soil of France and the execution of the most active enemies of the
Revolution left little reason for continued terror or war. When Britain
offered peace he advised acceptance. Robespierre refused, and
intensified the Terror on the. ground</p>
<p>7 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>hat the government was still beset by disloyalty, conspiracy, and
corrup- tion. Camille Desmoulins, once secretary to Danton, long his
admiring friend, and, like him, enjoying a happy marriage, made his
journal, Le Vieux Cordelier, the mouthpiece of the “Indulgents,” or
pacifiers, and called for an end to the Terror.</p>
<p>Liberty is no nymph of the opera, nor a red cap, nor a dirty shirt
and rags. Liberty is happiness, reason, equality, justice, the
Declaration of Rights, your sublime Constitution [still
hibernating].</p>
<p>Would you have me recognize this liberty, have me fall at her feet,
and shed all my blood for her? Then open the prison doors to the 200,000
citizens whom you call suspects…. Do not think that such a measure would
be fatal to the public. It would, on the contrary, be the most
revolutionary that you could adopt. You would exterminate all your
enemies by the guillotine? But was there ever greater madness? Can you
destroy one enemy on the scaffold without making two others among his
family and friends?</p>
<p>I am of a very different opinion from those who claim that it is
necessary to leave the Terror the order of the day. I am confident that
liberty will be as- sured, and Europe conquered, as soon as you have a
Committee of Clemency. 98</p>
<p>Robespierre, heretofore friendly to Desmoulins, was alarmed by this
appeal to open the prisons. Those aristocrats, priests, speculators, and
swell- ing bourgeois — would they not, if released, resume all the more
confidently their schemes to exploit or destroy the Republic? He was
convinced that the fear of arrest, speedy condemnation, and a ghastly
death was the only force that would keep the enemies of the Revolution
from plotting its fall. He suspected that Danton’s sudden quality of
mercy was a ruse to save f rom the guillotine some associates lately
arrested for malfeasance, and to protect Danton himself from exposure of
his relations with these men. Some of them — Fabre d’Fglantine and
Francois Chabot— were tried on January 17, 1794, and were found guilty.
Robespierre concluded that Danton and Des- moulins were bent on
unseating and putting an end to the Committee. He concluded that he
would never be safe as long as these old friends of his were alive.</p>
<p>He kept his foes disunited, and played their opposed factions against
each other; he encouraged the attacks of Danton and Desmoulins upon
Hebert, and welcomed their aid in opposing the war against religion.
Hebert coun- tered by supporting the riots of townspeople against the
cost and scarcity of food; he condemned both the government and the
Indulgents; on March 4, 1794, he denounced Robespierre by name, and on
March 1 1 his followers at the Cordeliers Qub openly threatened
insurrection. A majority of the Com- mittee agreed with Robespierre that
the time had come to act. Hebert, Cloots, and several others were
arrested, and were tried on a charge of mal- feasance in the
distribution of provisions to the people. It was a subtle accu- sation,
for it left the sansculottes doubtful of their new leaders; and before
they could decide upon revolt the men were condemned, and were quickly
led to the guillotine (March 24). Hebert broke down and wept; Qoots,
Teutonically calm as he waited for his turn to die, called to the crowd,
“My friends, don’t confuse me with these rascals.” 99</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Danton must have realized that he had been used as a tool against
Hebert, and was now of little value to the Committee. Even so he
continued to alien- ate the Committee by advocating mercy and peace —
policies requiring the members to repudiate the Terror that had
preserved them and the war that had excused their dictatorship. He urged
an end to the killing; “Let us,” he said, “leave something to the
guillotine of opinion.” He still planned educa - tional projects and
judiciary reforms. And he remained defiant. Someone told him that
Robespierre was planning his arrest; “If I thought he had even the idea
of it,” he answered, “I would eat his heart out.” 100 In the almost
“state of nature” to which the Terror had reduced France many men felt
that they had to eat or be eaten. His friends urged him to take the
initiative and at- tack the Committee before the Convention. But he was
too tired in nerve and will to follow his own historic summons to
audacity; he was exhausted by breasting, through four years, the waves
of the Revolution, and now he let the undertow carry him away
unresisting. “I would rather be guillotined than guillotine others,” he
said (it had not always been so); “and, besides, I am sick of the human
race.” 101</p>
<p>It was apparently Billaud-Varenne who took the initiative in
recom-</p>
<p>mending death for Danton. Many members of the Committee agreed with
him that to allow the campaign of the Indulgents to go on was to
surrender the Revolution to its enemies at home and abroad. Robespierre
was for a time reluctant to conclude that the life of Danton should be
summarily shortened. He shared with the other members of the Committee
the belief that Danton had allowed some moneys of the state to stick to
his fingers, but he recognized the services that Danton had rendered to
the Revolution, and he feared that a sentence of death for one of its
greatest figures would lead to insurrection in the sections and the
National Guard.</p>
<p>During this period of Robespierre’s hesitation Danton visited him two
or three times, not only to defend his financial record but to convert
the somber patriot to the policy of ending the Terror and seeking peace.
Robes- pierre remained unconvinced, and grew more hostile. He helped
Saint-Just (whom Danton had often ridiculed) to prepare the case against
his greatest rival. On March 30 he joined the Committee of Public Safety
and the Com- mittee of General Security in their united resolve to
secure from the Revo- lutionary Tribunal a sentence of death for Danton,
Desmoulins, and twelve men lately convicted of embezzlement. A friend of
“the Titan” rushed the news to him and urged him to leave Paris and hide
himself in the provinces. He refused. The next morning the police
arrested him and Desmoulins, who lived on the floor above him.
Imprisoned in the Conciergerie, he remarked, “On a day like this I
organized the Revolutionary Tribunal…. I ask pardon for it of God and
man…. In revolutions authority remains with the great- est scoundrels.”
102</p>
<p>On April 1, Louis Legendre, recently a representative on mission,
pro- posed to the deputies that Danton be sent for from prison and
allowed to defend himself before the Convention. Robespierre stopped him
with an ominous glare. “Danton,” he cried, “is not privileged…. We shall
see this</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>day whether the Convention will be able to destroy a pretended idol
long since rotted away.” 103 Then Saint -Just read the bill of charges
that he had prepared. The deputies, each mindful of his own safety,
ordered that Dan- ton and Desmoulins be brought immediately to
trial.</p>
<p>On April 2 they were led before the Tribunal. Perhaps to confuse the
issues, they were made part of a batch of men including Fabre
d’Eglantine, other “conspirators” or embezzlers, and— to the general
surprise as well as his own — Herault de Sechelles, suave member of the
Committee, now accused of association with the Hebertists and the
foreign plot. Danton defended himself with force and satirical wit,
which made such an impression on the jury and spectators 104 that
Fouquier-Tinville dispatched an appeal to the Committee for a decree
that would silence the defense. The Committee obliged by sending to the
Convention a charge that the followers of Danton and Desmoulins were,
with their knowledge, plotting to rescue them by force; on this basis
the Convention declared the two men to be outlaws — which meant that,
being “outside the (protection of the) law,” they might now be killed
without due process of law. On receiving this decree the jurymen
announced that they had received sufficient testimony, and were ready to
render a verdict. The prisoners were returned to their cells; the
spectators were dismissed. On April 5 the unanimous verdict was an-
nounced: death for all the accused. Hearing it, Danton predicted,
“Before t hese months are out the people will tear my enemies to
pieces.” 105 And again: “Vile Robespierre! The scaffold claims you too.
You will follow me.” 106 From his cell Desmoulins wrote to his wife: “My
beloved Lucile! I was born to make verses and to defend the
unfortunate…. My darling, care for your little one; live for my Horace;
speak to him of me…. My bound hands embrace you.” 107</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 5 the condemned men were carted to the
Place de la Revolution. En route Danton prophesied again: “I leave it
all in a frightful welter. Not a man of them has an idea of government.
Robespierre will follow me; he is dragged down by me. Ah, better be a
poor fisherman than meddle with the governing of men.” 108 On the
scaffold Desmoulins, near the breaking point of his nerves, was third in
the line to death, Danton was the last. He too thought of his young
wife, and murmured some words for her, then caught himself: “Come,
Danton, no weakness.” As he ap- proached the knife he told the
executioner, “Show my head to the people; it is worth it.” 109 He was
thirty -four years old, Desmoulins too; but they had lived many lives
since that July day when Camille called upon the Parisians to take the
Bastille. Eight days after their death Lucile Desmoulins, along with
Hebert’s widow and Chaumette, followed them to the guillotine.</p>
<p>The slate seemed clear; all the groups that had challenged the
Committee of Public Safety had been eliminated or suppressed. The
Girondins were dead or dispersed; the sansculottes had been divided and
silenced; the clubs — excepting the Jacobin — had been closed; the press
and the theater were under strict censorship; the Convention, cowed,
left all major decisions to the Committee. Under that tutelage, and
instructed by its other committees,</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>he Convention passed laws against hoarders and speculators,
proclaimed free, universal primary education, abolished slavery in the
French colonies, and established a welfare state with social security,
unemployment benefits, medical aid for the poor, and relief for the old.
These measures were in large part frustrated by war and chaos, but they
remained as ideas to inspire suc- ceeding generations.</p>
<p>Robespierre, his hands incarnadined but free, now attended to
restoring God to France. The attempt to replace Christianity with
rationalism was turning the country against the Revolution. In Paris the
Catholics were re- belling against the closing of the churches and the
harassment of priests; more and more of the lower and middle classes
were going to Sunday Mass. In one of his eloquent addresses (May 7,
1794) Robespierre argued that the time had come to reunite the
Revolution with its spiritual progenitor Rous- seau (whose remains had
been transferred to the Pantheon on April 14); the state should support
a pure and simple religion — essentially that of the Savoyard Vicar in
Emile — based upon belief in God and an afterlife, and preaching civic
and social virtue as the necessary foundation of a republic. The
Convention agreed, hoping that this move would appease the pious and
mitigate the Terror; and on June 4 it made Robespierre its
president.</p>
<p>In this official capacity, on June 8, 1794, he presided over a “Feast
of the Supreme Being,” before 100,000 men, women, and children assembled
in the Champ-de-Mars. At the head of a long procession of skeptical
deputies the Incorruptible walked with flowers and wheat ears in his
hand, to the accom- paniment of music and choral song. A great car drawn
by milk-white oxen carried sheaves of golden com; behind it came
shepherds and shepherdesses representing Nature (in her fairer moods) as
one form and voice of God. On one of the basins that adorned the Field
of Mars, David, the leading French artist of the age, had carved in wood
a statue of Atheism supported by sculptured vices and crowned with
Madness; over against these he had raised a figure of Wisdom triumphant
over all. Robespierre, embodiment of virtue, applied a torch to Atheism,
but an ill wind diverted the blaze to Wisdom. A magnanimo us overall
inscription announced: “The French peo - ple recognizes the Supreme
Being, and the immortality of the soul.” 110 Simi - lar ceremonies were
held throughout France. Robespierre was happy, but Billaud- Varenne told
him, “You begin to bore me with your Supreme Be- ing.”</p>
<p>Two days later Robespierre induced the Convention to decree an aston-
ishing reinforcement of tne Terror; it was as if he was answering and
defy- ing Danton as, with the Feast, he had rebuked Hebert. The Law of
22 Prairial (June 10, 1794) established the death penalty for advocating
mdn- archy or calumniating the republic; for outraging morality; for
giving out false news; for stealing public property; for profiteering or
embezzling; for impeding the transport of food; for interfering in any
way with the prosecu- tion of the war. Furthermore the decree empowered
the courts to decide whether the accused should be allowed counsel, what
witnesses should be heard, when the taking of evidence should end. 111
“As for myself,” said one</p>
<p>80 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>juryman, “I am always convinced. In a revolution all who appear
before this Tribunal ought to be condemned.” 112</p>
<p>Some excuses were given for this intensification of the Terror. On
May 22 an attempt had been made on the life of Collot d’Herbois; on May
23 a young man was intercepted in an apparent attempt to assassinate
Robes- pierre. Belief in a foreign plot to kill the leaders of the
Revolution led the Convention to decree that no quarter should be given
to British or Hano- verian prisoners of war. The prisons of Paris held
some eight thousand sus- pects who might revolt and escape; they had to
be immobilized by fear.</p>
<p>So began the e specially “Great Terror,” lasting from June 10 to July
27,</p>
<ol start="1794" type="1">
<li><p>In not quite seven weeks 1,376 men and women were guillotined —
155 more than in the sixty-one weeks between March, 1793, and June
10,</p></li>
<li><p>113 Fouquier-Tinville remarked that heads were f alling “like
slates from a roof.” 114 The people no longer went to executions, these
had become so common; rather they stayed home, and watched every word
they spoke. Social life nearly ceased; the taverns and brothels were
almost empty. The Convention itself was reduced to a skeleton; out of
its original 7 50 deputies only 1 1 7 now attended, and many of these
abstained from voting lest they compromise themselves. Even Committee
members lived in fear that they would fall under the axe of the new
triumvirate — Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Probably it was the war that led powerful individuals to submit to so
irri- tating a concentration of authority. In April, 1794, the Prince of
Saxe- Coburg had led another army into France, and any defeat of the
French defenders could lead to a chaos of fear in Paris. The British
blockade was trying to keep American provisions from France, and only
the defeat of a British fleet by a French convoy (June 1 ) enabled
precious cargoes to reach Brest. Then a French army threw back the
invaders near Charleroi (June</p>
<p>25), and a day later Saint-Just led a French force to a decisive
victory at Fleurus. Coburg withdrew from France, and on July 27 Jourdan
and Piche- gru crossed the frontier to establish French authority in
Antwerp and Liege.</p>
<p>This triumphant repulse of the princely incursion may have shared in
destroying Robespierre; his multiplying enemies could feel that the
country and the Army would survive the shock of an open conflict to the
death at the heart of the government. The Committee of General Security
was at odds with that of Public Safety over the policing power, and
within the latter body Billaud- Varenne, Collot d’Herbois, and Carnot w
ere in rising revolt against Robespierre and Saint-Just. Feeling their
hostility, Robespierre avoided Committee meetings between July 1 ana 23,
hoping that this would cool their resentment of his leadership; but it
gave them more opportunity to plan his fall. Moreover, his strategy
faltered: on July 23 he made enemies of former supporters by yielding to
the plaints of businessmen and signing a decree establishing maximum
wages for labor; in effect, because of depreci- ated currency, the
decree lowered some wages to half of what they had been before. 115</p>
<p>It was the terrorists returned from the provinces — Fouche, Freron,
Tal-</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>8l</p>
<p>lien, Carrier — who decided that their lives depended on the
elimination of Robespierre. It was he who had recalled them to Paris and
had demanded of them an account of their missions. “Come, tell us,
Fouche,” he asked, “who deputed you to tell the people that there is no
God?” 116 At the Jacobin Club he proposed that Fouche submit to
interrogation about his operations in Toulon and Lyons, or be struck
from membership. Fouche refused to submit to such an examination, and
retaliated by circulating a list of men who, he claimed, were among
Robespierre’s new candidates for the g uillo- tine. As for Tallien, he
needed no such instigation; his charming mistress, Theresa Cabarrus, had
been arrested on May 22, allegedly on Robespierre’s orders; rumor said
she had sent Tallien a dagger. Tallien swore to free her at whatever
cost.</p>
<p>On July 26 Robespierre made his last speech before the Convention.
The deputies were hostile, for many of them had reacted against the
hasty execu- tion of Danton, and many more blamed Robespierre for having
reduced the Convention to impotence. He tried to answer these
charges:</p>
<p>Citizens:… I need to open my heart, and you need to hear the truth….
I have come here to dispel cruel errors. I have come to stifle the
horrible oaths of discord with which certain men want to fill this
temple of liberty….</p>
<p>What foundation is there for this odious system of terror and
slander? To whom must we show ourselves terrible?… Is it tyrants and
rascals who fear us, or men of good will and patriots?… Do we strike
terror into the National Convention? But what are we without the
National Convention? — we who have defended the Convention at the peril
of our lives, who have devoted our- selves to its preservation while
detestable factions plot its ruin for all men to see?… For whom were the
first blows of the conspirators intended?… It is we whom they seek to
assassinate, it is we whom they call the scourge of France…. Some time
ago they declared war on certain members of the Com- mittee of Public
Safety. Finally they seemed to aim at destroying one man…. They call me
tyrant…. They were particularly anxious to prove that the Revolutionary
Tribunal was a tribunal of blood, created by me alone, and which I
dominate absolutely for the purpose of beheading all men of good
will….</p>
<p>I dare not name [these accusers] here and now. I cannot bring myself
to tear away completely the veil that covers this profound mystery of
crimes. But this I affirm positively: that among the authors of this
plot are the agents of that system of venality intended by foreigners to
destroy the Republic…. The traitors, hidden here under false exteriors,
will accuse their accusers, and will multiply all stratagems… to stifle
the truth. Such is part of the con- spiracy.</p>
<p>I will conclude that… tyranny reigns among us; but not that I must
keep silence. How can one reproach a man who has truth on his side, and
who knows how to die for his country ? 117</p>
<p>There were some blunders in this historic speech — surprisingly many
for one who had heretofore picked his way with caution amid the pitfalls
of politics; power dements even more than it corrupts, lowering the
guard of foresight and raising the haste of action. The tone of the
speech — the proud presumption not only of innocence but of “a man who
has the truth on his side”— could be judicious only in a Socrates
already half inclined to death.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>It was hardly wise to incite and infuriate his enemies by threatening
them with exposure — that is, with death. It was unwise to affirm that
the Conven- tion was free from fear of the Terror, when it knew that it
was not. Worst of all, by refusing to name the men he proposed to
indict, he multiplied those deputies who might consider themselves
future victims of his wrath. The Convention received his appeal coldly,
and defeated a motion to print it. Robespierre repeated the speech that
evening at the Jacobin Club, to great applause; and there he added an
open attack upon Billaud-Varenne and Collot d’Herbois, who were present.
They went from the club to the rooms of the Committee, where they found
Saint-Just writing what he too boldly told them was to be their
indictment. 118</p>
<p>The next morning, July 27 (the 9th of Thermidor), Saint-Just rose
to</p>
<p>present that indictment to a Convention dark with hostility and tense
with fear. Robespierre sat directly before the rostrum. His devoted
host, Duplay, had warned him to expect trouble, but Robespierre had
confidently reas- sured the soothsayer, “The Convention is in the main
honest; all large masses of men are honest.” 119 Unluckily the presiding
officer on that day was one of his sworn foes — Collot d’Herbois. When
Saint -Just began to read his bill of accusation, Tallien, expecting to
be included, sprang to the platform, pushed the young orator aside, and
cried out, “I ask that the curtain be torn away!” Joseph Lebas, loyal to
Saint -Just, tried to come to his aid, but his words were drowned out by
a hundred voices. Robespierre demanded a chance to be heard, but he too
was shouted down. Tallien raised aloft the weapon that had been sent
him, and declared, “I have armed myself with a dagger, which shall
pierce his breast if the Convention has not the courage to decree his
accusation.” 120</p>
<p>Collot yielded the chair to Thuriot, who had been an ally of
Danton.</p>
<p>Robespierre approached the podium shouting; Thuriot’s bell outrang
most of Robespierre’s words, but some of them surmounted the tumult:
“For the last time, President of Assassins, will you give me leave to
speak?” The Con - vention roared its disapproval of this form of
address, and one deputy uttered the fatal words: “I demand the arrest of
Robespierre.” Augustin Robespierre spoke up like a Roman: “I am as
guilty as my brother; I share his virtues; I ask that my arrest be
decreed with his.” Lebas begged and received the same privilege. The
decree was voted. Police took the two Robespierres, Saint- Just, Lebas,
and Couthon, and hurried them to the Luxembourg jail.</p>
<p>Fleuriot-Lescot, then mayor of Paris, ordered the prisoners
transferred to the Hotel de Ville, where he received them as honored
guests, and offered them his protection. The heads of the Commune bade
Hanriot, head of the National Guard in the capital, to take soldiers and
guns to the Tuileries, and hold the Convention captive until it revoked
its decree of arrest; but Han- riot was too drunk to carry out his
mission. The deputies appointed Paul Barras to raise a force of
gendarmes, go to the Hotel de Ville, and rearrest the prisoners. The
mayor again appealed to Hanriot, who, unable to reas- semble the Paris
National Guard, gathered an impromptu collection of sans-</p>

<p>culottes instead; but they had now little love for the man who had
lowered their wages and killed Hebert and Chaumette, Danton and
Desmoulins; be- sides, rain began to fall, and they melted away to their
work or their homes. Barras and his gendarmes easily seized control in
the Hotel de Ville. Seeing them, Robespierre tried suicide, but the shot
triggered by his unsteady hand</p>
<p>E assed through his cheek and only shattered his jaw. 121 Lebas,
steadier, blew is own brains out. Augustin Robespierre broke a leg in a
useless leap from a window. Couthon, with lifeless legs, was thrown
downstairs, and lay there helpless till the gendarmes carried him to
jail with the two Robespierres and Saint-Just.</p>
<p>The following afternoon (July 28, 1794) four tumbrils conveyed these
four, with Fleuriot, Hanriot (still drunk), and sixteen others to the
guillo- tine in what we now admire as ( pro tempore) the Place de la
Concorde. En route they heard from the onlookers divers cries, among
them “Down with the maximum!” 122 They found a fashionable audience
awaiting them: win - dows overlooking the square had been rented at
fancy prices; ladies came arrayed as for a festival. When Robespierre’s
head was held up to the crowd a shout of satisfaction rose. One more
death might mean little, but this one, Paris felt, meant that the Terror
had come to an end.</p>

<li>THE THERMIDOREANS: JULY 29, 1794- OCTOBER 26, 1795</li>
</ol>
<p>On July 29 the victors of the 9th Thermidor sent seventy members of
the Paris Commune to death; thereafter the Commune was subject to the
Con- vention. The tyrannical Law of 22 Prairial was revoked (August 1);
im- prisoned opponents of Robespierre were released; some of his
followers took their places. 123 The Revolutionary Tribunal was reformed
to allow fair trials; Fouquier-Tinville was called upon to defend his
record, but his in- genuity preserved his head till May 7, 1795. The
Committees of Public Safety and General Security survived, but their
claws were clipped. Con- servative periodicals bloomed; radical journals
died through lack of public support. Tallien, Fouche, and Freron found
that they could share in the new leadership only by getting the
Convention to ignore their roles in the Ter- ror. The Jacobin clubs were
closed throughout France (November 12). The long- intimidated deputies
of the “Plain” moved to the right; the “Mountain” fell from power ; and
on December 8 seventy-three surviving Girondin delegates were restored
to their seats. The bourgeoisie recaptured the Revolution.</p>
<p>The relaxation of government allowed the revival of religion. Aside
from that small minority which had received a college education, and
that upper middle class which had been touched by the Enlightenment,
most French- men, and nearly all Frenchwomen, preferred the saints and
ceremonies of the Catholic calendar to the rootless festivals and
formless Supreme Being of Robespierre. On February 15, 1795, a treaty of
peace was signed with the</p>
<p>84 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Vendee rebels, guaranteeing them freedom of worship; a week later
this was extended to all France; and the government pledged the
separation of Church and state.</p>
<p>More difficult was the problem of simultaneously satisfying those
peren- nial enemies: producers and consumers. The producers clamored for
repeal of the maximum on prices; consumers demanded an end to the
maximum on wages. The Convention, now controlled by enthusiastic
believers in freedom of enterprise, competition, and trade, heard the
conflicting appeals, and abolished the maxima (December 24, 1794); now
the workers were free to seek higher wages, the peasants and merchants
were free to charge all that the traffic would bear. Prices rose on the
wings of greed. The government issued new assignats as paper money, but
their value fell even more rapidly than before: a bushel of flour that
had cost the Parisians two assignats in 1790 cost them 225 in 1795; a
pair of shoes rose from five to two hundred, a dozen eggs from
sixty-seven to 2,5oo. 124</p>
<p>On April 1, 1795, several localities in Paris broke out once more in
riots over the price of bread. An unarmed crowd invaded the Convention,
de- manding food and an end to the persecution of radicals; several
deputies from the melting Mountain supported them. The Convention
promised im- mediate relief, but it summoned the National Guard to
disperse the rioters. That night it decreed the deportation of radical
leaders — Billaud- Varenne, Collot d’Herbois, Barere, Vadier— to Guiana.
Barere and Vadier evaded ar- rest; Billaud and Collot were carried off
to a hard life in the South American colony. There the two anticlericals
fell sick, and were cared for by nuns. Collot succumbed. Billaud
survived, took a mulatto slave as a wife, became a contented farmer, and
died in Haiti in 18 19. 125</p>
<p>Public protest became violent. Placards appeared calling for
insurrection. On May 20 a throng of women and armed men invaded the
Convention, crying out for bread, for the liberation of arrested
radicals, and finally for the abdication of the government. One deputy
was killed by a pistol shot; his severed head, raised on a pike, was
presented before the Convention president, Boissy d’Anglas, who gave it
a formal salute; then troops and rain drove the petitioners to their
homes. On May 22 soldiers under General Pichegru surrounded the
working-class Faubourg St. -Antoine and forced the remaining armed
rebels to surrender. Eleven Montagnard deputies were arrested, charged
with complicity in the uprising; two escaped, four killed themselves,
five, dying of self-innicted wounds, were hurried to the guillo- tine. A
royalist deputy urged the arrest of Carnot; a voice protested, “He
organized our victories,” and Carnot survived.</p>
<p>Now — May and June, 1795 — a “White Terror” raged in which Jacobins
were victims and the judges were bourgeois “Moderates” allied with re -
ligious bands: “Companies of Jesus,” “Companies of Jehu,” “Companies of
the Sun.” At Lyons (May 5) ninety -seven former Terrorists were
massacred in prison; at Aix-en- Provence (May 17) thirty more were
butchered “with refinements of barbarity”; similar ceremonies took place
at Arles, Avignon, and Marseilles. At Tarascon (May 25) two hundred
masked men seized the</p>

<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>fortress, bound the prisoners, and flung them into the Rhone. At
Toulon the workers rose against the new Terror; Isnard, one of the
restored Giron- dins, led troops against them and exterminated them (May
31). 126 The Ter- ror had not ended; it had changed hands.</p>
<p>The victorious bourgeoisie no longer needed proletarian allies, for
it had won the support of the generals, and these were winning victories
that raised their prestige even with the sansculottes. On January 19,
1795, Piche- gru took Amsterdam; Stadtholder William IV fled to England;
Holland, for a decade, becam e the “Batavian Republic” under French
tutelage. Other French armies recaptured and held the left bank of the
Rhine. The Allies, defeated and quarreling, left France for easier prey
in Poland. Prussia, ab- sorbed in preventing Russia from taking
everything in the Third Partition (1795), sent emissaries to Paris, then
to Basel, to negotiate a separate peace with France. The Convention
could afford to be demanding, for it looked with trepidation toward a
peace that would bring to Paris or elsewhere thousands of
half-brutalized troops who had been living at the expense of conquered
lands but would now add to crime, disease, and tumult in cities already
crying for work and bread. And the restless generals, swollen with
victory — Pichegru, Jourdan, Hoche, Moreau — would they resist the
tempta- tion to seize the government through a military coup d’etat? So
the Conven - tion sent to Basel Marquis Frangois de Barthelemy, with
instructions to hold out for French possession of the left bank of the
Rhine. Prussia protested and yielded; Saxony, Hanover, and Hesse-Cassel
followed suit; and on June 22 Spain ceded to France the eastern part
(Santo Domingo) of the island of Hispaniola. War with Austria and
England continued — just enough to keep French soldiers at the
fronts.</p>
<p>On June 27, thirty-six hundred emigres, brought over from Portsmouth
in British ships, landed on the promontory of Quiberon in Brittany, and
joined up with royalist “Chouan” bands in an effort to revive the Vendee
re - volt. Hoche in a brilliant campaign defeated them (July 21), and on
a motion by Tallien the Convention had 748 captured emigres put to
death. On June 8, 1795, the ten-year-old Dauphin died in prison, not
demon- strably the result of ill usage, but probably from scrofula and
despondency. The royalists thereupon acknowledged the older of Louis
XVI’s two sur - viving brothers, the emigre Comte de Provence, as Louis
XVIII, and swore to place him on the throne of France. This unreformed
Bourbon announced (July 1, 1795) that if restored he would re-establish
the Ancien Regime in- tact, with absolute monarchy and feudal rights.
Hence the united support that the French bourgeoisie, peasantry, and
sansculottes gave to Napoleon through a dozen wars.</p>
<p>Nevertheless France was weary of revolution, and began to tolerate
monarchist sentiments that were appearing in some journals, salons, and
prosperous homes: only a king legitimized by heredity and tradition
could bring order and security back to a people fearful and unhappy
after three years of political and economic disruption, religious
division, constant war, and uncertainty of work, food, and life. Half or
more of. southern France</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>was deeply alienated from Paris and its politicians. In Paris the
section as- semblies, once dominated by sansculottes, were now
increasingly controlled by businessmen, and some of them had been
captured by royalists. At the theaters those lines that sp oke of the
“good old days” before 1789 were openly applauded. Youngsters,
constitutionally rebellious, were now rebel- ling against revolution;
they organized themselves in bands called Jeunesse Doree (Gilded Youth),
Merveilleux (Freaks), or Muscadins (Fruits) ; proud of their rich or
bizarre dress, their long or curly hair, they walked the streets
wielding dangerous clubs and boldly proclaiming royalist sentiments. It
had become so unfashionable to support the revolutionary government that
when a premature report went the rounds that the Convention was breaking
up, the news was greeted with joy, and some Parisians danced in the
streets.</p>
<p>But the Convention took its time dying. In June, 1795, it began to
draw up another constitution, far different from the democratic and
never prac- ticed Constitution of 1793. Now it adopted a bicameral
legislature, in which the consent of an upper chamber of older and
experienced deputies would be required for the enactment of any measure
adopted by a lower chamber more directly open to popular movements and
new ideas. The people, said Boissy d’Anglas, are not wise or stable
enough to determine the policy of a state. 127 So this “Constitution of
the Year III” (i.e., the year beginning September 22, 1794) revised the
Declaration of the Rights of Man (1789) to check popular delusions of
virtue and power; it omitted the proposition that “men are born, and
remain, free and equal in rights,” and explained that equality meant
merely that “the law is the same for all men.” Election was to be
indirect: the voters would choose delegates to the “electoral col -
lege” of their department, and these electors would choose the members
of the national legislature, the judiciary, and the administrative
agencies. Eligi- bility to the electoral colleges was so limited to
owners of property that only thirty thousand Frenchmen chose the
national government. Woman suf- frage was proposed to the Convention by
one deputy, but was disposed of by another deputy’s question “Where is
the good wife who dares maintain that the wish of her husband is not her
own?” 128 State control of the econ - omy was rejected as impractical,
as stifling invention and enterprise, and as slowing the growth of
national wealth.</p>
<p>This constitution contained some liberal elements: it affirmed
religious liberty and, within “safe limits,” the freedom of the press
(then largely con - trolled by the middle class).* Furthermore, the
ratification of the constitu- tion was to be left to adult male
suffrage, with a surprising proviso: two thirds of the deputies to the
new assemblies must be members of the existing Convention, and if that
number should not be chosen the re-elected members were to fill the two
thirds by cooptation of additional present deputies; this, argued the
endangered delegates, was necessary for the “continuity of ex- perience
and policy. The voters were docile: of 958,226 ballots cast, 941,853</p>

<p>THE CONVENTION</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>accepted the constitution; and of 263,131 votes on the two-thirds
require- ment, 167,758 approved. 129 On September 23, 1795, the
Convention made the new constitution the law of France, and prepared to
retire in good order.</p>
<p>It could claim some achievements despite its months of disorder and
Ter- ror, of subservience to its committees, of frightened purging of
its member- ship at the command of the sansculottes. It had maintained
some rule of law in a city where law had lost its aura and its roots. It
had consolidated the empowerment of the bourgeoisie, but it had tried to
control the greed of merchants sufficiently to keep a turbulent populace
just above starvation. It had organized and trained armies, had raised
able and devoted generals, had repelled a powerful coalition, and had
won a peace that left France pro- tected by natural frontiers of the
Rhine, the Alps and Pyrenees, and the seas. Amid all these consuming
efforts it had established the metric system, it had founded or restored
the Museum of Natural History, the £cole Poly- technique, and the School
of Medicine; it had inaugurated the Institute of France. It felt that
now, after three years of miraculous survival, it deserved a peaceful
death and two thirds of a resurrection.</p>
<p>But it was to be a bloody death, in the manner of the time. The
pluto- crats and royalists, who had captured the Lepeletiere section of
Paris around the stock exchange, rose in revolt against that legislated
rebirth. Other sec- tions, for their own diverse reasons, joined them.
Together they improvised a force of 25,000 men, who advanced to
positions that commanded the Tuileries and therefore the Convention (13
Vendemiaire, October 5, 1795). The frightened deputies appointed Barras
to extemporize a defense. He com- missioned the twenty-six-year-old
Bonaparte, then idle in Paris, to gather men, supplies, and, above all,
artillery. The hero of Toulon knew where the cannon were housed, sent
Murat and a force to secure them; they were brought to him, and were
placed at points overlooking the advancing insur- gents. A command to
disperse was broadcast; it was disdained. Napoleon ordered his artillery
to fire; between two and three hundred of the besiegers fell; the rest
fled. The Convention had survived its last ordeal, and Napoleon,
decisive and ruthless, entered upon the most spectacular career in
modern history.</p>
<p>On October 26 the Convention declared itself dissolved, and on Novem-
ber 2, 1 795, the final phase of the Revolution began.</p>
