<p>XThe Life of the Mind</p>
<p>I. HINDU SCIENCE</p>
<p>Its religious origins — Astronomers — Mathematicism — The “ Ara -</p>
<p>bic ” numerals— The decimal system — Algebra — Geometry-</p>
<p>Physics — Chemistry — Physiology — Vedic medicine —</p>
<p>Physicians — Surgeons — Anesthetics — Vaccination</p>
<p>— Hypnotism</p>
<p>I NDIA’S work in science is both very old and very young: young
as</p>
<p>an independent and secular pursuit, old as a subsidiary interest of
her priests. Religion being the core of Hindu life, those sciences were
culti- vated first that contributed to religion: astronomy grew out of
the wor- ship of the heavenly bodies, and the observation of their
movements aimed to fix the calendar of festival and sacrificial days;
grammar and philology developed out of the insistence that every prayer
and formula, though couched in a dead language, should be textually and
phonetically cor- rect . 1 As in our Middle Ages, the scientists of
India, for better and for worse, were her priests.</p>
<p>Astronomy was an incidental offspring of astrology, and slowly
emanci- pated itself under Greek influence. The earliest astronomical
treatises, the Siddhantas (ca. 425 b.c.), were based on Greek science, 8
and Varahamihira, whose compendium was significantly entitled Complete
System of Natural Astrology, frankly acknowledged his dependence upon
the Greeks. The greatest of Hindu astronomers and mathematicians,
Aryabhata, discussed in verse such poetic subjects as quadratic
equations, sines, and the value of it; he explained eclipses, solstices
and equinoxes, announced the sphericity of the earth and its diurnal
revolution on its axis, and wrote, in daring anticipation of Renaissance
science: “The sphere of the stars is stationary, and the earth,</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE MIND</p>
<p>5 2 7</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ory of the revolution of the earth. These men and their followers
adapted to Hindu usage the Babylonian division of the skies into
zodiacal constella- tions; they made a calendar of twelve months, each
of thirty days, each of thirty hours, inserting an intercalary month
every five years; they calculated with remarkable accuracy the diameter
of the moon, the eclipses of the moon and the sun, the position of the
poles, and the position and motion of the major stars. 6 They expounded
the theory, though not the law, of gravity when they wrote in the
Siddhantas: “The earth, owing to its force of gravity, draws all things
to itself.” 6</p>
<p>To make these complex calculations the Hindus developed a system of
mathematics superior, in everything except geometry, to that of the
Greeks. 7 Among the most vital parts of our Oriental heritage are the
“Arabic” numerals and the decimal system, both of which came to us,
through the Arabs, from India. The miscalled “Arabic” numerals are</p>
<p>found on the Rock Edicts of Ashoka (256 b.c.), a thousand years
before their occurrence in Arabic literature. Said the great and
magnanimous Laplace:</p>
<p>It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all</p>
<p>numbers by ten symbols, each receiving a value of position as
well</p>
<p>as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so
simple to us now that we ignore its true merit. But its very</p>
<p>simplicity, the great ease which it has lent to all computations,
puts</p>
<p>our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions; and we
shall</p>
<p>appreciate the grandeur of this achievement the more when we re-
member that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius,</p>
<p>two of the greatest men produced by antiquity. 8</p>
<p>The decimal system was known to Aryabhata and Brahmagupta long before
its appearance in the writings of the Arabs and the Syrians; it was
adopted by China from Buddhist missionaries; and Muhammad Ibn Musa
al-Khwarazmi, the greatest mathematician of his age (d. ca. 850 a.d.),
seems to have introduced it into Baghdad. The oldest known use of the
zero in Asia or Europe* is in an Arabic document dated 873 a.d., three
years sooner than its first known appearance in India; but by general
con- sent the Arabs borrowed this too from India,® and the most modest
and most valuable of all numerals is one of the subtle gifts of India to
mankind.</p>

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>XAlgebra was developed in apparent independence by both the Hindus
and the Greeks;* but our adoption of its Arabic name ( al-jabr ,
adjustment) in- dicates that it came to western Europe from the Arabs —
i.e., from India — rather than from Greece. 1 “ The great Hindu leaders
in this field, as in as- tronomy, were Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and
Bhaskara. The last (b. 1114 a.d.), appears to have invented the radical
sign, and many algebraic symbols. 13 These men created the conception of
a negative quantity, without which algebra would have been impossible;
13 they formulated rules for finding permutations and combinations; they
found the square root of 2, and solved, in the eighth century a.d.,
indeterminate equations of the second degree that were unknown to Europe
until the days of Euler a thousand years later. 14 They expressed their
science in poetic form, and gave to mathematical prob- lems a grace
characteristic of India’s Golden Age. These two may serve as examples of
simpler Hindu algebra:</p>
<p>Out of a swarm of bees one-fifth part settled on a Kadamba blos-</p>
<p>som; one-third on a Silindhra flower; three times the difference
of</p>
<p>those numbers flew to the bloom of a Kutaja. One bee, which re-</p>
<p>mained, hovered about in the air. Tell me, charming woman, the</p>
<p>number of bees. . . . Eight rubies, ten emeralds, and a hundred</p>
<p>pearls, which are in thy ear-ring, my beloved, were purchased by</p>
<p>me for thee at an equal amount; and the sum of the prices of the</p>
<p>three sorts of gems was three less than half a hundred; tell me
the</p>
<p>price of each, auspicious woman. 15</p>
<p>The Hindus were not so successful in geometry. In the measurement and
construction of altars the priests formulated the Pythagorean theorem
(by which the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals
the sum of the squares of the other sides) several hundred years before
the birth of Christ. 16 Aryabhata, probably influenced by the Greeks,
found the area of a triangle, a trapezium and a circle, and calculated
the value of tt (the relation of diameter to circumference in a circle)
at 3.1416 — a figure not equaled in accuracy until the days of Purbach
(1423-61) in Europe. 17 Bhas- kara crudely anticipated the differential
calculus, Aryabhata drew up a table of sines, and the Surya Siddhanta
provided a system of trigonometry more advanced than anything known to
the Greeks. 18</p>
<p>Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively
similar to those of Greece. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika
philosophy, held that the world was composed of atoms as many in kind as
the various</p>
<ul>
<li>The first algebraist known to us, the Greek Diophantus (360 a.d.),
antedates Aryab- hata by a century; but Cajori believes that he took his
lead from India. 11</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND 529</p>
<p>elements. The Jains more nearly approximated to Democritus by
teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different
effects by diverse modes of combination. 19 Kanada believed light and
heat to be varieties of the same substance; Udayana taught that all heat
comes from the sun; and Vachaspati, like Newton, interpreted light as
composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye.
20 Musical notes and intervals were analyzed and mathematically
calculated in the Hindu treatises on music;* and the “Pythagorean Law”
was formulated by which the number of vi - brations, and therefore the
pitch of the note, varies inversely as the length of the string between
the point of attachment and the point of touch.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that Hindu mariners of the first centuries
a.d. used a compass made by an iron fish floating in a vessel of oil and
pointing north. 21</p>
<p>Chemistry developed from two sources — medicine and industry. Some-
thing has been said about the chemical excellence of cast iron in
ancient India, and about the high industrial development of Gupta times,
when India was looked to, even by Imperial Rome, as the most skilled of
the nations in such chemical industries as dyeing, tanning, soap-making,
glass and cement. As early as the second century b.c. Nagarjuna devoted
an entire volume to mercury. By the sixth century the Hindus were far
ahead of Europe in industrial chemistry; they were masters of
calcination, distillation, sublimation, steaming, fixation, the
production of light without heat, the mixing of anesthetic and soporific
powders, and the preparation of metallic salts, com- pounds and alloys.
The tempering of steel was brought in ancient India to a perfection
unknown in Europe till our own times; King Porus is said to have
selected, as a specially valuable gift for Alexander, not gold or
silver, but thirty pounds of steel. 22 The Moslems took much of this
Hindu chemical science and industry to the Near East and Europe; the
secret of manufactur- ing “Damascus” blades, for example, was taken by
the Arabs from the Per - sians, and by the Persians from India. 22 *
1</p>
<p>Anatomy and physiology, like some aspects of chemistry, were
by-products of Hindu medicine. As far back as the sixth century b.c.
Hindu physicians described ligaments, sutures, lymphatics, nerve plexus,
fascia, adipose and vascular tissues, mucous and synovial membranes, and
many more muscles than any modern cadaver is able to show. 23 The
doctors of pre-Christian India shared Aristotle’s mistaken conception of
the heart as the seat and organ of consciousness, and supposed that the
nerves ascended to and descended from the heart. But they understood
remarkably well the processes of diges- tion — the different functions
of the gastric juices, the conversion of chyme into chyle, and of this
into blood. 24 Anticipating Weismann by 2400 years,</p>
<p>*E.g., in The Ocean of Music ( Samgita-ratnakara ) of Sharamgadeva
(1210-47).</p>
<p>530 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XAtreya (ca. 500 b.c.) held that the parental seed is independent of
the parent’s body, and contains in itself, in miniature, the whole
parental organism. 25 Ex- amination for virility was recommended as a
prerequisite for marriage in men; and the Code of Manu warned against
marrying mates affected with tuber- culosis, epilepsy, leprosy, chronic
dyspepsia, piles, or loquacity. 28 Birth con- trol in the latest
theological fashion was suggested by the Hindu medical schools of 500
b.c. in the theory that during twelve days of the menstrual cycle
impregnation is impossible. 27 Foetal development was described with
considerable accuracy; it was noted that the sex of the foetus remains
for a time undetermined, and it was claimed that in some cases the sex
of the embryo could be influenced by food or drugs. 28</p>
<p>The records of Hindu medicine begin with the Atharva-veda; here, em-
bedded in a mass of magic and incantations, is a list of diseases with
their symptoms. Medicine arose as an adjunct to magic: the healer
studied and used earthly means of cure to help his spiritual formulas;
later he relied more and more upon such secular methods, continuing the
magic spell, like our bedside manner, as a psychological aid. Appended
to the Atharva-veda is the Ajur- veda (“The Science of Longevity”). In
this oldest system of Hindu medicine illness is attributed to disorder
in one of the four humors (air, water, phlegm and blood), and treatment
is recommended with herbs and charms. Many of its diagnoses and cures
are still used in India, with a success that is sometimes the envy of
Western physicians. The Rig-veda names over a thousand such herbs, and
advocates water as the best cure for most diseases. Even in Vedic times
physicians and surgeons were being differentiated from magic doctors,
and were living in houses surrounded by gardens in which they cultivated
medicinal plants. 29</p>
<p>The great names in Hindu medicine are those of Sushruta in the fifth
century before, and Charaka in the second century after Christ.
Sushruta, professor of medicine in the University of Benares, wrote down
in San- skrit a system of diagnosis and therapy whose elements had
descended to him from his teacher Dhanwantari. His book dealt at length
with sur- gery, obstetrics, diet, bathing, drugs, infant feeding and
hygiene, and medical education. 30 Charaka composed a Samhita (or
encyclopedia) of medicine, which is still used in India, 31 and gave to
his followers an almost Hippocratic conception of their calling: “Not
for self, not for the ful - filment of any earthly desire of gain, but
solely for the good of suffering humanity should you t reat your
patients, and so excell all.” 32 Only less illustrious than these are
Vagbhata (625 a.d.), who prepared a medical compendium in prose and
verse, and Bhava Misra (1550 a.d.), whose</p>
<p>chap.xex) the lifi of the mind 531</p>
<p>voluminous work on anatomy, physiology and medicine mentioned, a
hundred years before Harvey, the circulation of the blood, and pre-</p>
<p>scribed mercury for that novel disease, syphilis, which had recently
been brought in by the Portuguese as part of Europe’s heritage to India.
8 3</p>
<p>Sushruta described many surgical operations — cataract, hernia,
lithot- omy, Caesarian section, etc. — and 12 1 surgical instruments,
including lancets, sounds, forceps, catheters, and rectal and vaginal
speculums. 34 Despite Brahmanical prohibitions he advocated the
dissection of dead bodies as indispensable in the training of surgeons.
He was the first to graft upon a torn ear portions of skin taken from
another part of the body; and from him and his Hindu successors
rhinoplasty — the surgical reconstruction of the nose — descended into
modern medicine. 85 “The ancient Hindus,” says Garrison, “performed
almost every major opera - tion except ligation of the arteries.” 88
Limbs were amputated, abdominal sections were performed, fractures were
set, hemorrhoids and fistulas were removed. Sushruta laid down elaborate
rules for preparing an operation, and his suggestion that the wound be
sterilized by fumigation is one of the earliest known efforts at
antiseptic surgery. 87 Both Sushruta and Charaka mention the use of
medicinal liquors to produce insensibility to pain. In 927 a.d. two
surgeons trepanned the skull of a Hindu king, and made him insensitive
to the operation by administering a drug called Samohim i. #88</p>
<p>For the detection of the 1120 diseases that he enumerated, Sushruta
recommended diagnosis by inspection, palpation, and auscultation.“ Tak-
ing of the pulse was described in a treatise dating 1300 a.d.“
Urinalysis was a favorite method of diagnosis; Tibetan physicians were
reputed able to cure any patient without having seen anything more of
him than his water.* 8 In the time of Yuan Chwang Hindu medical
treatment began with a seven-day fast; in this interval the patient
often recovered; if the illness continued, drugs were at last employed.“
Even then drugs were used very sparingly; reliance was placed largely
upon diet, baths, enemas, inhalations, urethral and vaginal injections,
and blood-lettings by leeches or cups.** Hindu physicians were
especially skilled in concocting anti- dotes for poisons; they still
excel European physicians in curing snake- bites.“ Vaccination, unknown
to Europe before the eighteenth century,</p>

<p>5 3 2 THE story of civilization (chap.xix</p>
<p>was known in India as early as 550 a.d., if we may judge from a
text</p>
<p>attributed to Dhanwantari, one of the earliest Hindu physicians:
“Take the fluid of the pock on the udder of the cow . . . upon the point
of a lancet, and lance with it the arms between the shoulders and elbows
until the blood appears; then, mixing the fluid with the blood, the
fever of the small- pox will be produced.” 18 Modern European physicians
believe that caste separateness was prescribed because of the Brahman
belief in invis- ible agents transmitting disease; many of the laws of
sanitation enjoined by Sushruta and “Manu” seem to take for granted what
we modems, who love new words for old things, call the germ theory of
disease.“ Hyp- notism as therapy seems to have originated among the
Hindus, who often took their sick to the temples to be cured by hypnotic
suggestion or “temple - sleep,” as in Egypt and Greece. 18 The
Englishmen who intro - duced hypnotherapy into England — Braid, Esdaile
and Elliotson — “un - doubtedly got their ideas, and some of their
experience, from contact with India.” 18</p>
<p>The general picture of Indian medicine is one of rapid
development</p>
<p>in the Vedic and Buddhist periods, followed by centuries of slow and
cautious improvement. How much Atreya, Dhanwantari and Sushruta owed to
Greece, and how much Greece owed to them, we do not know. In the time of
Alexander, says Garrison, “Hindu physicians and surgeons enjoyed a
well-deserved reputation for superi or knowledge and skill,” and even
Aristotle is believed by some students to have been indebted to them. 80
So too with the Persians and the Arabs: it is difficult to say how much
Indian medicine owed to the physicians of Baghdad, and through them to
the heritage of Babylonian medicine in the Near East; on the one hand
certain remedies, like opium and mercury, and some modes of diag- nosis,
like feeling the pulse, appear to have entered India from Persia; on the
other we find Persians and Arabs translating into their languages, in
the eighth century a.d., the thousand-year-old compendia of Sushruta and
Charaka. 51 The great Caliph Haroun-al-Rashid accepted the preeminence
of Indian medicine and scholarship, and imported Hindu physicians to
organize hospitals and medical schools in Baghdad. 83 Lord Ampthill con-
cludes that medieval and modem Europe owes its system of medicine di-
rectly to the Arabs, and through them to India. 83 Probably this noblest
and most uncertain of the sciences had an approximately equal antiquity,
and developed in contemporary contact and mutual influence, in Sumeria,
Egypt and India.</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF THE MIND</p>

<li>THE SIX SYSTEMS OF BRAHMANICAL PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>The antiquity of Indian philosophy — Its prominent role — Its</p>
<p>scholars — Forms — Conception of orthodoxy — The as-</p>
<p>sumptions of Hindu philosophy</p>
<p>The priority of India is clearer in philosophy than in medicine,
though here too origins are veiled, and every conclusion is an
hypothesis. Some Upanishads are older than any extant form of Greek
philosophy, and Pythagoras, Parmenides and Plato seem to have been
influenced by Indian metaphysics; but the speculations of Thales,
Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras and Empedocles not only
antedate the secular philosophy of the Hindus, but bear a sceptical and
physical stamp sug- gesting any other origin than India. Victor Cousin
believed that “we are</p>
<p>But nowhere else has the lust for philosophy been so strong as in
India. It is, with the Hindus, not an ornament or a recreation, but a
major interest and practice of life itself; and sages receive in India
the honor bestowed in the West upon men of wealth or action. What other
nation has ever thought of celebrating festivals with gladiatorial
debates between the lead- ers of rival philosophical schools? We read in
the Upanishads how the King of the Videhas, as part of a religious
feast, set one day apart for a philosophical disputation among
Yajnavalkya, Asvala, Artabhaga and Gargi (the Aspasia of India) ; to the
victor the King promised — and gave — a reward of a thousand cows and
many pieces of gold . 55 It was the usual course for a philosophical
teacher in India to speak rather than to write; instead of attacking his
opponents through the safe medium of print, he was expected to meet them
in living debate, and to visit other schools in order to submit himself
to controversy and questioning; leading philoso- phers like Shankara
spent much of their time in such intellectual jour- neys . 57 Sometimes
kings joined in these discussions with the modesty be- coming a monarch
in the presence of a philosopher — if we may credit the reports of the
philosophers. The victor in a vital debate was as great a hero among his
people as a general returning from the bloody triumphs of war . 55</p>
<p>In a Rajput painting of the eighteenth century 55 we see a typical
Indian “School of Philosophy”— the teacher sits on a mat under a tree,
and his</p>
<p>534 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xpupils squat on the grass before him. Such scenes were to be
witnessed everywhere, for teachers of philosophy were as numerous in
India as mer- chants in Babylonia. No other country has ever had so many
schools of thought. In one of Buddha’s dialogues we learn that there
were sixty - tw o distinct theories of the soul among the philosophers
of his time.” “This philosophical nation par excellence says Count
Keyserling, “has more Sanskrit words for philosophical and religious
thought than are found in Greek, Latin and German combined.” 0 1</p>
<p>Since Indian thought was transmitted rather by oral tradition than by
writ- ing, the oldest form in which the theories of the various schools
have come down to us is that of sutras — aphoristic “threads” which
teacher or student jotted down, not as a means of explaining his thought
to another, but as an aid to his own memory. These extant sutras are of
varying age, some as old as 200 a.d., some as recent as 1400; in all
cases they are much younger than the traditions of thought that they
summarize, for the origin of these schools of philosophy is as old as
Buddha, and some of them, like the Sankhya , were probably
well-established when he was born. 02</p>
<p>All systems of Indian philosophy are ranged by the Hindus in two</p>
<p>categories: Astika systems, which affirm, and Nastika systems, which
deny.* We have already studied the Nastika systems, which were chiefly
those of the Charvakas, the Buddhists, and the Jains. But, strange to
say, these systems were called Nastika, heterodox and nihilist, not
because they questioned or denied the existence of God (which they did),
but because they questioned, denied or ignored the authority of the
Vedas. Many of the Astika systems also doubted or denied God; they were
nevertheless called orthodox because they accepted the infallibility of
the Scriptures, and the institution of caste; and no hindrance was
placed against the free thought, however atheistic, of those schools
that acknowledged these fundamentals of orthodox Hindu society. Since a
wide latitude was al- lowed in interpreting the holy books, and clever
dialecticians could find in the Vedas any doctrine which they sought,
the only practical require- ment for intellectual respectability was the
recognition of caste; this being the real government of India, rejection
of it was treason, and acceptance of it covered a multitude of sins. In
effect, therefore, the philosophers of India enjoyed far more liberty
than their Scholastic analogues in Europe,</p>
<p>Asti, it is; n’asti, it is not.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND 535</p>
<p>though less, perhaps, than the thinkers of Christendom under the
enlight- ened Popes of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Of the “orthodox” systems or darshanas (“demonstrations”), six be -
came so prominent that in time every Hindu thinker who acknowledged the
authority of the Brahmans attached himself to one or another of these
schools. All six make certain assumptions which are the bases of Hindu
thought: that the Vedas are inspired; that reasoning is less reliable as
a guide to reality and truth than the direct perception and feeling of
an individual properly prepared for spiritual receptiveness and subtlety
by ascetic practices and years of obedient tutelage; that the purpose of
knowledge and philosophy is not control of the world so much as release
from it; and that the goal of thought is to find freedom from the suf-
fering of frustrated desire by achieving freedom from desire itself.
These are the philosophies to which men come when they tire of ambition,
struggle, wealth, “progress,” and “success.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Nyaya System</li>
</ol>
<p>A Hindu logician</p>
<p>The first of the “Brahmanical” systems in the logical order of
Indian</p>
<p>thought (for their chronological order is uncertain, and they are in
all essen- tials contemporary) is a body of logical theory extending
over two millenni- ums. Nyaya means an argument, a way of leading the
mind to a conclusion. Its most famous text is the Nyaya Sutra ascribed
without surety to a Gautama dated variously between the third century
before, and the first century after, Christ . 03 Like all Hindu
thinkers, Gautama announces, as the purpose of his work, the achievement
of Nirvana, or release from the tyranny of desire, here to be reached by
clear and consistent thinking; but we suspect that his simple intent was
to offer a guide to the perplexed wrestlers in India’s philosophical
debates. He formulates for them the principles of argument, exposes the
tricks of controversy, and lists the common fallacies of thought. Like
another Aristotle, he seeks the structure of reasoning in the syllogism,
and finds the crux of argument in the middle term;* like another James
or Dewey he looks upon knowledge and thought as pragmatic tools and
organs of human need and will, to be tested by their ability to lead to
successful ac- tion.“ He is a realist, and will have nothing to do with
the sublime idea that the world ceases to exist when no one takes the
precaution to perceive it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Nyaya syllogism, however, has five propositions: theorem,
reason, major premiss, minor premiss and conclusion. E.g.: (i) Socrates
is mortal, (2) for he is a man; (3) all men are mortal; (4) Socrates is
a man; (j) therefore Socrates is mortal.</li>
</ul>
<p>53 &lt;5 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XGautama’s predecessors in Nyaya were a pparently atheists; his
successors be- came epistemologists. 65 His achievement was to give
India an organon of in- vestigation and thought, and a rich vocabulary
of philosophical terms.</p>

<li>The Vaisheshika System</li>
</ol>
<p>Democritus in India</p>
<p>As Gautama is the Aristotle of India, so Kanada is its Democritus.
His name, which means the “atom - eater,” suggests that he may be a
legendary construct of the historical imagination. The date at which the
Vaisheshika system was formulated has not been fixed with excessive
accuracy: we are told that it was not before 300 b.c., and not after 800
a.d. Its name came from vishesha, meaning particularity: the world, in
Kanada’s theory, is full of a number of things, but they are all, in
some form, mere combinations of atoms; the forms change, but the atoms
remain indestructible. Thoroughly Democritean, Kanada announces that
nothing exists but “atoms and the void,” and that the atoms move not
according to the will of an intelligent deity, but through an impersonal
force or law —Adrishta, “the invisible.” Since there is no conservative
like the child of a radical, the later exponents of Vaishe- shika,
unable to see how a blind force could give order and unity to the
cosmos, placed a world of minute souls alongside the world of atoms, and
supervised both worlds with an intelligent God. 00 So old is the “pre
-estab- lished harmony” of Leibnitz.</p>

<p>This, says a Hindu historian, “is the most significant system of
philos - ophy that India has produced.” 07 Professor Garbe, who devoted
a large part of his life to the study of the Sankhya, consoled himself
with the thought that “in Kapila’s doctrine, for the first time in the
history of the world, the complete independence and freedom of the human
mind, its full confidence in its own powers, were exhibited.” 08 It is
the oldest of the six systems, 08 and perhaps the oldest philosophical
system of all.* Of</p>

<li>Its earliest extant literature, the Sankhya-karika of the
commentator Ishvara Krishna, dates back only to the fifth century a.d.,
and the Sankhya-sutras once attributed to Kapila are not older than our
fifteenth century; but the origins of the system apparently antedate
Buddhism itself . 70 The Buddhist texts and the Mahabharatd 70a
repeatedly refer to it, and Winternitz finds its influence in Pythagoras
. 705</li>

<p>537</p>
<p>Kapila himself nothing is known, except that Hindu tradition, which
has a schoolboy’s scorn for dates, credits him with founding the Sankhya
philosophy in the sixth century B.c. n</p>
<p>Kapila is at once a realist and a scholastic. He begins almost
medically by laying it down, in his first aphorism, that “the complete
cessation of pain … is the complete goal of man.” He rejects as
inadequate the at - tempt to elude suffering by physical means; he
refutes, with much logical prestidigitation, the views of all and sundry
on the matter, and then pro- ceeds to construct, in one unintelligibly
abbreviated sutra after another, his own metaphysical system. It derives
its name from his enumeration (for this is the meaning of sankhya) of
the twenty-five Realities (Tattwas, “Thatnesses”) which, in Kapila’s
judgment, make up the world. He ar - ranges these Realities in a complex
relationship that may possibly be clari- fied by the following

<li>B. SPIRIT ( Purusha , “Person”), a universal psychical principle
which,</li>
</ol>
<p>though unable to do anything of itself, animates and vitalizes
Prakriti, and stirs its evolutionary powers to all their activities.</p>
<p>At its outset this seems to be a purely materialistic system: the
world of mind and self as well as of body and matter appears entirely as
an evolution by natural means, a unity and continuity of elements in
per- petual development and decay from the lowest to the highest and
back again. There is a premonition of Lamarck in Kapila’s thought: the
need of the organism (the “Self”) generates the function (sight,
hearing, smell, taste and touch), and the function produces the organ
(eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin) . There is no gap in the system, and
no vital distinction in any Hindu philosophy, between the inorganic and
the organic, between the vegetable and the animal, or between the animal
and the human, world; these are all links in one chain of life, spokes
on the wheel of evo- lution and dissolution, birth and death and birth.
The course of evolution is determined fatalistically by the three active
qualities or powers (Gums) of Substance: purity, activity, and blind
ignorance. These powers are not prejudiced in favor of development
against decay; they produce the one after the other in an endless cycle,
like some stupid magician drawing an infinity of contents from a hat,
putting them back again, and repeating the process forever. Every state
of evolution contains in itself, as Herbert Spencer was to say some time
later, a tendency to lapse into dissolution as its fated counterpart and
end.</p>
<p>Kapila, like Laplace, saw no need of calling in a deity to explain
crea- tion or evolution; 72 in this most religious and philosophical of
nations it is nothing unusual to find religions and philosophies without
a god. Many of the Sankhya texts explicitly deny the existence of a
personal creator; creation is inconceivable, for “a thing is not made
out of nothing”; 72 creator</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND 539</p>
<p>be either bound or free, and God cannot be either. If God is perfect,
he had no need to create a world; if he is imperfect he is not God.</p>
<p>If God were good, and had divine powers, he could not possibly have
created so imperfect a world, so rich in suffering, so certain in death
. 76 It is instructive to see with what calmness the Hindu thinkers
discuss these questions, seldom resorting to persecution or abuse, and
keeping the debate upon a plane reached in our time only by the
controversies of the maturest scientists. Kapila protects himself by
recognizing the authority of the Vedas: “The Vedas,” he says, simply,
“are an authority, since the author of them knew the established truth
.” 76 After which he proceeds without paying any attention to the
Vedas.</p>
<p>But he is no materialist; on the contrary, he is an idealist and a
spiritual- ist, after his own unconventional fashion. He derives reality
entirely from perception; our sense organs and our thought give to the
world all the reality, form and significance which it can ever have for
us; what the world might be independently of them is an idle question
that has no meaning, and can never have an answer . 77 Again, after
listing twenty-four Tattwas which belong, in his system, under physical
evolution, he upsets all his incipient materialism by introducing, as
the last Reality, the strang- est and perhaps the most important of them
all — Purusha, “Person” or Soul. It is not, like twenty-three other
Tattwas, produced by Prakriti or physical force; it is an independent
psychical principle, omnipresent and everlasting, incapable of acting by
itself, but indispensable to every action. For Prakriti never develops,
the Gunas never act, except through the in- spiration of Purusha; the
physical is animated, vitalized and stimulated to evolve by the psy
chical principle everywhere.” Here Kapila speaks like Aristotle: “There
is a ruling influence of the Spirit” (over Prakriti, or the</p>
<p>Spirit is plural in the sense that it exists in each organism; but in
all it is alike, and does not share in individuality. Individuality is
physical; we are what we are, not because of our Spirit, but because of
the origin,</p>
<ul>
<li>“The evolution of Prakriti” says one Hindu commentator on Kapila,
“has no purpose except to provide a spectacle for the soul .” 80
Perhaps, as Nietzsche suggested, the wisest way to view the world is as
an esthetic and dramatic spectacle.</li>
</ul>
<p>540 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xevolution and experiences of our bodies and minds. In Sankhya the
mind is as much a part of the body as any other organ is. The secluded
and untouched Spirit within us is free, while the mind and body are
bound by the laws and Gunas or qualities of the physical world ; 81 it
is not the Spirit that acts and is determined, it is the body-mind. Nor
is Spirit affected by the decay and passing of the body and the
personality; it is untouched by the stream of birth and death. “Mind is
perishable,” says Kapila, “but not Spirit”; 88 only the individual self,
bound up with matter and body, is born, dies, and is bom again, in that
tireless fluctuation of physical forms which constitutes the history of
the external world . 88 Kapila, capable of doubting everything else,
never doubts transmigration.</p>
<p>Like most Hindu thinkers, he looks upon life as a very doubtful good,
if a good at all. “Few are these days of joy, few are these days of
sorrow; wealth is like a swollen river, youth is like the crumbling bank
of a</p>
<p>swollen river, life is li ke a tree on the crumbling bank .” 84
Suffering is the result of the fact that the individual self and mind
are bound up with mat- ter, caught in the blind forces of evolution.
What escape is there from this suffering? Only through philosophy,
answers our philosopher; only through understanding that all these pains
and griefs, all this division and turbulence of striving egos, are Maya
, illusion, the insubstantial pageantry of life and time. “Bondage
arises from the error of not discriminating” 95 — between the self that
suffers and the Spirit that is immune, between the surface that is
disturbed and the basis that remains unvexed and unchanged. To rise
above these sufferings it is only necessary to realize that the es-
sence of us, which is Spirit, is safe beyond good and evil, joy and
pain, birth and death. These acts and struggles, these successes and
defeats, distress us only so long as we fail to see that they do not
affect, or come from, the Spirit; the enlightened man will look upon
them as from out- side them, like an impartial spectator witnessing a
play. Let the soul recognize its independence of things, and it will at
once be free; by that very act of understanding it will escape from the
prison of space and time, of pain and reinc arnation . 89 “Liberation
obtained through knowledge of the twenty- five Realities,” says Kapila,
“teaches the one only knowledge —that neither I am, nor is aught mine,
nor do I exist ;” 81 that is to say, personal separateness is an
illusion; all that exists is the vast evolving and dissolving froth of
matter and mind, of bodies and selves, on the one side, and on the other
the quiet eternity of the immutable and imperturbable</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND £41</p>
<p>Such a philosophy will bring no comfort to one who may find some</p>
<p>difficulty in separating himself from his aching flesh and his
grieving memory; but it seems to have well expressed the mood of
speculative India. No other body of philosophic thought, barring the
Vedanta , has so profoundly affected the Hindu mind. In the atheism and
epistemo- logical idealism of Buddha, and his conception of Nirvana, we
see the influence of Kapila; we see it in the Mahabharata and the Code
of Manu, in the Pur anas* and the Tantras — which transform Purusha and
Prakriti into the male and female principles of creation ; 88 above all
in the system of Yoga, which is merely a practical development of
Sankhya, built upon its theories and couched in its phrases. Kapila has
few explicit adherents today, since Shankara and the Vedanta have
captured the Hindu mind; but an old proverb still raises its voice
occasionally in India: “There is no knowledge equal to the Sankhya, and
no power equal to the Yoga.”* 0</p>

<p>Xwhom the religion and philosophy of India find their ultimate and
strang- est expression. In lesser numbers one comes upon them in the
woods or on the roadside, immovable and absorbed. Some are old, some are
young; some wear a rag over the shoulders, some a cloth over the loins;
some are clothed only in dust of ashes, sprinkled over the body and into
the mottled hair. They squat cross-legged and motionless, staring at
their noses or their navels. Some of them look squarely into the face of
the sun hour after hour, day after day, letting themselves go slowly
blind; some sur- round themselves with hot fires during the midday heat;
some walk bare- foot upon hot coals, or empty the coals upon their
heads; some lie naked for thirty-five years on beds of iron spikes; some
roll their bodies thousands of miles to a place of pilgrimage; some
chain themselves to trees, or im- prison themselves in cages, until they
die; some bury themselves in the earth up to their necks, and remain
that way for years or for life; some pass a wire through both cheeks,
making it impossible to open the jaws, and so condemning themselves to
live on liquids; some keep their fists clenched so long that their nails
come through the back of the hand; some hold up an arm or a leg until it
is withered and dead. Many of them sit quietly in one position, perhaps
for years, eating leaves and nuts brought to them by the people,
deliberately dulling every sense, and concentrating every thought, in
the resolve to understand. Most of them avoid spec- tacular methods, and
pursue truth in the quiet retreat of their homes.</p>
<p>We have had such men in our Middle Ages, but we should have to</p>
<p>look for them today in the nooks and crannies of Europe and America.
India has had them for 2500 years — possibly from the prehistoric days
when, perhaps, they were the shamans of savage tribes. The system of
ascetic meditation known as Yoga existed in the time of the Vedas™ the
Upanishads and the Mahabharata accepted it; it flourished in the age of
Buddha;” and even Alexander, attracted by the ability of these “gymno -
sophists” to bear pain silently, stopped to study them, and invited one
of their number to come and live with him. The Yogi refused as firmly as
Diogenes, saying that he wanted nothing from Alexander, being content
with the nothing that he had. His fellow ascetics laughed at the Mace-
donian’s boyish desire to conquer the earth when, as they told him, only
a few feet of it sufficed for any man, alive or dead. Another sage,
Calanus (326 b.c.), accompanied Alexander to Persia; growing ill there,
he asked permission to die, saying that he preferred death to illness;
and calmly</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND 543</p>
<p>mounting a funeral pyre, he allowed himself to be burned to death
with- out uttering a sound — to the astonishment of the Greeks, who had
never seen this unmurderous sort of bravery before.” Two centuries later
(ca. 150 b.c.), Patanjali brought the practices and traditions of the
system to- gether in his famous Yoga-sutras, which are still used as a
text in Yoga centers from Benares to Los Angeles.” Yuan Chwang, in the
seventh cen - tury a.d., described the system as having thousands of
devotees; 04 Marco Polo, about 1296, gave a vivid description of it”
today, after all these centuries, its more extreme followers, numbering
from one to three mil- lion in India,” still torture themselves to find
the peace of understanding. It is one of the most impressive and
touching phenomena in the history of man.</p>
<p>What is Yoga? Literally, a yoke: not so much a yoking or union of the
soul with the Supreme Being,” as the yoke of ascetic discipline and
absti - nence which the aspirant puts upon himself in order to cleanse
his spirit of all material limitations, and achieve supernatural
intelligence and powers.” Matter is the root of ignorance and suffering;
therefore Yoga seeks to free the soul from all sense phenomena and all
bodily attachment; it is an attempt to attain supreme enlightenment and
salvation in one life by atoning in one existence for all the sins of
the soul’s past incarnations.”</p>
<p>Such enlightenment cannot be won at a stroke; the aspirant must move
towards it step by step, and no stage of the process can be understood
by anyone who has not passed through the stages before it; one comes to
Yoga only by long and patient study and self-discipline. The stages of
Yoga are eight:</p>
<p>I. Yama, or the death of desire; here the soul accepts the restraints
of ahmsa and Brahmacharia, abandons all self-seeking, emancipates itself
from all material interests and pursuits, and wishes well to all things.

may learn to live on a minimum of air, and may let himself, with

mind and the senses with one idea or object to the exclusion of

desire; then the mind, abstracted from things, will be left free to feel
the immaterial essence of reality.t</p></li>
<li><p>Dhyana , or meditation: this is an almost hypnotic condition,
resulting from Dharana; it may be produced, says Patanjali, by the
persistent repeti- tion of the sacred syllable Om. Finally, as the
summit of Yoga , the ascetic arrives at</p></li>
<li><p>Samadhi , or trance contemplation; even the last thought now dis-
appears from the mind; empty, the mind loses consciousness of itself as
a separate being ; 103 it is merged with totality, and achieves a
blissful and god- like comprehension of all things in One. No words can
describe this condi- tion to the uninitiate; no intellect or reasoning
can find or formulate it; “through Yoga must Yoga be known .”
104</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless it is not God, or union with God, that the yogi
seeks;</p>
<p>in the Yoga philosophy God (Ishvara) is not the creator or preserver
of the universe, or the rewarder and punisher of men, but merely one of
several objects on which the soul may meditate as a means of achieving
con- centration and enlightenment. The aim, frankly, is that
dissociation of the mind from the body, that removal of all material
obstruction from the spirit, which brings with it, in Yoga theory,
supernatural understanding and capacity . 106 If the soul is cleansed of
all bodily subjection and involvement it will not be united with
Brahman, it will be Brahman; for Brahman is precisely that hidden
spiritual base, that selfless and immaterial soul,</p>

<p>t Eliot compares, for the illumination of this stage, a passage from
Schopenhauer, obvi- ously inspired by his study of Hindu philosophy:
“When some sudden cause or inward disposition lifts us out of the
endless stream of willing, the attention is no longer directed to the
motives of willing, but comprehends things free from their relation to
the will, and thus observes them without subjectivity, purely
objectively, gives itself entirely up to them so far as they are ideas,
but not in so far as they are motives. Then all at once the peace that
we were always seeking, but which always fled from us on the former path
of rhe desires, comes to us of its own accord, and it is well with us.”

<p>which remains when all sense attachments have been exercised away. To
the extent to which the soul can free itself from its physical
environment and prison it becomes Brahman, and exercises Brahman’s
intelligence and power. Here the magical basis of religion reappears,
and almost threatens the essence of religion itself — the worship of
powers superior to man.</p>
<p>In the days of the Upanishads, Yoga was pure mysticism — an attempt
to realize the identity of the soul with God. In Hindu legend it is said
that in ancient days seven Wise Men, or Rishis, acquired, by penance and
medi- tation, complete knowledge of all things.”” In the later history
of India Yoga became corrupted with magic, and thought more of the power
of miracles than of the peace of understanding. The Yogi trusts that by
Yoga he will be able to anesthetize and control any part of his body by
concentrating upon it; 1 ” he will be able at will to make himself
invisible, or to prevent his body from being moved, or to pass in a
moment from any part of the earth, or to live as long as he desires, or
to know the past and the future, and the most distant stars . 108</p>
<p>The sceptic must admit that there is nothing impossible in all this;
fools can invent more hypotheses than philosophers can ever refute, and
philoso- phers often join them in the game. Ecstasy and hallucinations
can be pro- duced by fasting and self-mortification, concentration may
make one locally or generally insensitive to pain; and there is no
telling what re- serve energies and abilities lurk within the unknown
mind. Many of the Yogis, however, are mere beggars who go though their
penances in the supposedly Occidental hope of gold, or in the simple
human hunger for notice and applause.* Asceticism is the reciprocal of
sensuality, or at best an attempt to control it; but the attempt itself
verges upon a masochistic sensuality in which the ascetic takes an
almost erotic delight in his pain. The Brahmans have wisely abstained
from such practices, and have coun- seled their followers to seek
sanctity through the conscientious perform- ance of the normal duties of
life. 1 ”</p>

<p>Xosophy, so this system is less philosophy than religion; it is an
orthodox re- action against the impious doctrines of the philosophers.
Its author, Jaimini, protested against the disposition of Kapila and
Kanada to ignore, while acknowledging, the authority of the Vedas. The
human mind, said Jaimini, is too frail an instrument to solve the
problems of metaphysics and the- ology; reason is a wanto n who will
serve any desire; it gives us not “science” and “truth,” but merely our
own rationalized sensuality and pride. The road to wisdom and peace lies
not through the vain labyrinths of logic, but in the modest acceptance
of tradition and the humble performance of the rituals prescribed in the
Scriptures. For this, too, there is something to be said: cela vous
abetira.</p>

<p>system — Death of Shankara</p>
<p>The word Vedanta meant originally the end of the Vedas — that is, the
Upanishads. Today India applies it to that system of philosophy which
sought to give logical structure and support to the essential doctrine
of the Upanishads — the organ-point that sounds throughout Indian
thought — that God (Brahman) and the soul (Atman) are one. The oldest
known form of this most widely accepted of all Hindu philosophies is the
Brahma-sutra of Badarayana (ca. 200 b.c.) — 555 aphorisms, of which the
first announces the purpose of all: “Now, then, a desire to know
Brahman.” Almost a thousand years later Gaudapada wrote a commentary on
these sutras, and taught the esoteric doctrine of the system to Govinda,
who taught it to Shankara, who composed the most famous of Vedanta
commentaries, and made himself the greatest of Indian philosophers.</p>
<p>In his short life of thirty-two years Shankara achieved that union
of</p>
<p>sage and saint, of wisdom and kindliness, which characterizes the
loftiest type of man produced in India. Bom among the studious
Nambudri</p>
<p>Brahmans of Malabar, he rejected the luxuries of the world, and while
still a youth became a sannyasi, worshiping unpretentiously the gods of
the Hindu pantheon, and yet mystically absorbed in a vision of an all-
embracing Brahman. It seemed to him that the profoundest religion and
the profoundest philosophy were those of the Upanishads. He could pardon
the polytheism of the people, but not the atheism of Sankhya or the
agnos- ticism of Buddha. Arriving in the north as a delegate of the
south, he</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND 547</p>
<p>won such popularity at the University of Benares that it crowned him
with its highest honors, and sent him forth, with a retinue of
disciples, to champion Brahmanism in all the debating halls of India. At
Benares, prob- ably, he wrote his famous commentaries on the Upanishads
and the Bhagavad-Gita, in which he attacked with theological ardor and
scholastic subtlety all the heretics of India, and restored Brahmanism
to that position of intellectual leadership from which Buddha and Kapila
had deposed it.</p>
<p>There is much metaphysical wind in these discourses, and arid deserts
of textual exposition; but they may be forgiven in a man who at the age
of thirty could be at once the Aquinas and the Kant of India. Like</p>
<p>Aquinas, Shankara accepts the full authority of his country’s
Scriptures as a divine revelation, and then sallies forth to find proofs
in experience and reason for all Scriptural teachings. Unlike Aquinas,
however, he does not believe that reason can suffice for such a task; on
the contrary he wonders have we not exaggerated the power and role, the
clarity and reliability, of reason. m Jaimini was right: reason is a
lawyer, and will prove anything we wish; for every argument it can find
an equal and opposite argument, and its upshot is a scepticism that
weakens all force of character and under- mines all values of life. It
is not logic that we need, says Shan-</p>
<p>kara, it is insight, the faculty (akin to art) of grasping at once
the essential out of the irrelevant, the eternal out of the temporal,
the whole out of the part: this is the first prerequisite to philosophy.
The second is a will- ingness to observe, inquire and think for und
erstanding’s sake, not for the sake of invention, wealth or power; it is
a withdrawal of the spirit from all the excitement, bias and fruits of
action. Thirdly, the philosopher must acquire self-restraint, patience,
and tranquillity; he must learn to live above physical temptation or
material concerns. Finally there must burn, deep in his soul, the desire
for moksha, for liberation from ignorance, for an end to all
consciousness of a separate self, for a blissful absorption in the
Brahman of complete understanding and infinite unity . 112 In a word,
the student needs not the logic of reason so much as a cleansing and
deepening discipline of the soul. This, perhaps, has been the secret of
all profound education.</p>
<p>Shankara establishes the source of his philosophy at a remote and
subtle point never quite clearly visioned again until, a thousand years
later, Immanuel Kant wrote his Critique of Pure Reason. How, he asks,
is</p>
<p>knowledge possible? Apparently, all our knowledge comes from the
senses, and reveals not the external reality itself, but our sensory
adapta-</p>
<p>548 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xtion — perhaps transformation — of that reality. By sense, then, we
can never quite know the “real”; we can know it only in that garb of
space, t ime and cause which may be a web created by our organs of sense
and under- standing, designed or evolved to catch and hold that fluent
and elusive reality whose existence we can surmise, but whose character
we can never objectively describe; our Way of perceiving will forever be
inextricably mingled with the thing perceived.</p>
<p>This is not the airy subjectivism of the solipsist who thinks that he
can destroy the world by going to sleep. The world exists, but it is
Maya — not delusion, but phenomenon, an appearance created partly by our
thought. Our incapacity to perceive things except through the film of
space and time, or to think of them except in terms of cause and change,
is an innate limitation, an Avidya, or ignorance, which is bound up with
our very mode of perception, and to which, therefore, all flesh is heir.
Maya and Avidya are the subjective and objective sides of the great
illusion by which the intellect supposes that it knows the real; it is
through Maya and Avidya, through our birthright of ignorance, that we
see a multiplicity of objects and a flux of change; in truth there is
only one Being, and change is “a mere name” for the superficial
fluctuations of forms. Behind the Maya or Veil of change and things, to
be reached not by sensation or intellect but only by the insight and
intuition of the trained spirit, is the one universal reality,
Brahman.</p>
<p>This natural obscuration of sense and intellect by the organs and
forms of sensation and understanding bars us likewise from perceiving
the one unchanging Soul that stands beneath all individual souls and
minds. Our separate selves, visible to perception and thought, are as
unreal as the phantasmagoria of space and time; individual differences
and distinct per- sonalities are bound up with body and matter, they
belong to the kaleido- scopic world of change; and these merely
phenomenal selves will pass away with the material conditions of which
they are a part. But the underlying life which we feel in ourselves when
we forget space and time, cause and change, is the very essence and
reality of us, that Atman which we share with all selves and things, and
which, undivided and omnipresent, is identical with Brahman, God.™</p>
<p>But what is God? Just as there are two selves — the ego and Atman —
and two worlds — the phenomenal and the noumenal — so there are two
deities: an lshvara or Creator worshiped by the people through the
patterns of space, cause, time and change; and a Brahman or Pure Being
worshiped</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE MIND</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>by that philosophical piety which seeks and finds, behind all
separate things and selves, one universal reality, unchanging amid all
changes, indivisible amid all divisions, eternal despite all
vicissitudes of form, all birth and death. Polytheism, even theism,
belongs to the world of Maya and Avidya; they are forms of worship that
correspond to the forms of perception and thought; they are as necessary
to our moral life as space, time and cause are necessary to our
intellectual life, but they have no absolute validity or objective truth
. 114</p>
<p>To Shankara the existence of God is no problem, for he defines God as
existence, and identifies all real being with God. But of the existence
of a personal God, creator or redeemer, there may, he thinks, be some
ques- tion; such a deity, says this pre-plagiarist of Kant, cannot be
proved by reason, he can only be postulated as a practical necessity
offering peace to our limited intellects, and encouragement to our
fragile morality. The philosopher, though he may worship in every temple
and bow to every god, will pass beyond these forgivable forms of popular
faith; feeling the lllusoriness of plurality, and the monistic unity of
all things,* he will adore, as the Supreme Being, Being itself —
indescribable, limitless, spaceless, time- less, causeless, changeless
Being, the source and substance of all reality, f We may apply the
adjectives “conscious,” “intelligent,” even “happy” to Brahman , since
Brahman includes all selves, and these may have such qual- ities ; 116
but all other adjectives would be applicable to Brahman equally, since
It includes all qualities of all things. Essentially Brahman is neuter,
raised above personality and gender, beyond good and evil, above all
moral distinctions, all differences and attributes, all desires and
ends. Brahman is the cause and effect, the timeless and secret essence,
of the world.</p>
<p>The goal of philosophy is to find that secret, and to lose the seeker
in the secret found. To be one with God means, for Shankara, to rise
above — or to sink beneath — the separateness and brevity of the self,
with all its narrow purposes and interests; to become unconscious of all
parts, divisions, things; to be placidly at one, in a desireless
Nirvana, with that great ocean of Being in which there are no warring
purposes, no competing selves, no * Hence the name Advaita — non-dualism
— often given to the Vedanta philosophy.</p>
<p>t Shankara and the Vedanta are not quite pantheistic: things
considered as distinct from one another are not Brahman; they are
Brahman only in their essential, indivisible and changeless essence and
reality. “Brahman” says Shankara, “resembles not the world, and (yet)
apart from Brahman there is naught; all that which seems to exist
outside of It ( Brahman ) cannot exist (in such fashion) save in an
illusory manner, like the sem- blance of water in the desert.” 115 *</p>
<p>55 ° THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xparts, no change, no space, and no time.* To find this blissful
peace ( Ananda ) a man must renounce not merely the world but himself;
he must care nothing for possessions or goods, even for good or evil; he
must look upon suffering and death as Maya, surface incidents of body
and matter, time and change; and he must not think of his own personal
quality and fate; a single moment of self-interest or pride can destroy
all his liberation. 1 “ Good works cannot give a man salvation, for good
works have no validity or meaning except in the Maya world of space and
time; only the knowl- edge of the saintly seer can bring that salvation
which is the recognition of the identity of self and the universe, Atman
and Brahman, soul and God, and the absorption of the part in the whole .
120 Only when this absorption is complete does the wheel of
reincarnation stop; for then it is seen that the separate self and
personality, to which reincarnation comes, is an illu- sion .“ 1 It is
Ishvara, the Maya god, that gives rebirth to the self in punish- ment
and reward; but “when the identity” of Atman and Brahman “has become
known, then,” says Shankara, “the soul’s existence as wanderer, and
Brahman’s existence as creator” (i.e., as Ishvara) “have vanished away
.”“ 2 Ishvara and Karma, like things and selves, belong to the exot eric
doctrine of Vedanta as adapted to the needs of the common man; in the
esoteric or secret doctrine soul and Brahman are one, never wandering,
never dying, never changed .“ 3</p>
<p>It was thoughtful of Shankara to confine his esoteric doctrine to
philos- ophers; for as Voltaire believed that only a society of
philosophers could survive without laws, so only a society of supermen
could live beyond good and evil. Critics have complained that if good
and evil are Maya,</p>
<p>*Cf. Blake:</p>
<p>“I will go down to self-annihilation and Eternal Death.</p>
<p>Lest the Last Judgment come and find me unannihilate,</p>
<p>And I be seized and given into the hands of my own Selfhood .” 117 Or
Tennyson’s “Ancient Sage”:</p>
<p>“For more than once when I</p>
<p>Sat all alone, revolving in myself</p>
<p>The word that is the symbol of myself,</p>
<p>The mortal limit of the Self was loosed,</p>
<p>And passed into the Nameless, as a cloud</p>
<p>Melts into Heaven. I touched my limbs — the limbs</p>
<p>Were strange, not mine — and yet not shade of doubt</p>
<p>But utter clearness, and through loss of Self</p>
<p>The gain of such large life as matched with ours</p>
<p>Were Sun to spark — unshadowable in words,</p>
<p>Themselves but shadows of a shadow- world .” 118</p>
<p>CHAP.XIX) THE LIFE OF THE MIND 551</p>
<p>part of the unreal world, then all moral distinctions fall away, and
devils are as good as saints. But these moral distinctions, Shankara
cleverly re- plies, are real within the world of space and time, and are
binding for those who live in the world. They are not binding upon the
soul that has united itself with Brahman; such a soul can do no wrong,
since wrong implies desire and action, and the liberated soul, by
definition, does not move in the sphere of desire and (self-considering)
action. Whoever consciously injures another lives on the plane of Maya,
and is subject to its distinctions, its morals and its laws. Only the
philosopher is free, only wisdom is</p>
<p>liberty.*</p>
<p>It was a subtle and profound philosophy to be written by a lad in his
twenties. Shankara not only elaborated it in writing and defended it
successfully in debate, but he expressed snatches of it in some of the
most sensitive religious poetry of India. When all challenges had been
met he retired to a hermitage in the Himalayas, and, according to Hindu
tradi- tion, died at the age of thirty-two . 131 Ten religious orders
were founded in his name, and many disciples accepted and developed his
philosophy. One of them — some say Shankara himself — wrote for the
people a popular exposition of the Vedanta — the Mohamudgara, or “Hammer
of Folly”— in which the essentials of the system were summed up with
clarity and force:</p>
<p>Fool! give up thy thirst for wealth, banish all desires from thy</p>
<p>heart. Let thy mind be satisfied with what is gained by thy
Karma.</p>
<p>. . . Do not be proud of wealth, of friends, or of youth; time
takes</p>
<p>all away in a moment. Leaving quickly all this, which is full of</p>
<p>illusion, enter into the place of Brahman. . . . Life is tremulous,
like</p>
<p>a water-drop on a lotus-leaf. . . . Time is playing, life is waning
—</p>
<p>yet the breath of hope never ceases. The body is wrinkled, the</p>
<p>hair grey, the mouth has become toothless, the stick in the hand</p>
<p>shakes, yet man leaves not the anchor of hope. . . . Preserve

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xin. THE CONCLUSIONS OF HINDU PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>Decadence — Summary — Criticism — Influence</p>
<p>The Mohammedan invasions put an end to the great age of Hindu</p>
<p>philosophy. The assaults of the Moslems, and later of the Christians,
upon the native faith drove it, for self-defense, into a timid unity
that made treason of all debate, and stifled creative heresy in a
stagnant uniformity of thought. By the twelfth century the system of the
Vedanta , which in Shankara had tried to be a religion for philosophers,
was reinterpreted by such saints as Ramanuja (ca. 1050) into an orthodox
worship of Vishnu, Rama and Krishna. Forbidden to think new thoughts,
philosophy became not only scholastic but barren; it accepted its dogmas
from the priesthood, and proved them laboriously by distinctions without
difference, and logic without reason. 128</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Brahmans, in the solitude of their retreats and
under the protection of their unintelligibility, preserved the old
systems carefully in esoteric sutras and commentaries, and transmitted
across generations and centuries the conclusions of Hindu philosophy. In
all these systems, Brah- manical or other, the categories of the
intellect are represented as helpless or deceptive before a reality
immediately felt or seen;* and all our eigh- teenth-century rationalism
appears to the Indian metaphysician as a vain and superficial attempt to
subject the incalculable universe to the concepts of a salonnikre. “Into
blind darkness pass they who worship ignorance; into still greater
darkness the y who are content with knowledge.” 128 Hindu philosophy
begins where European philosophy ends — with an inquiry into the nature
of knowledge and the limitations of reason; it starts not with the
physics of Thales and Democritus, but with the epistemology of Locke and
Kant; it takes mind as that which is most immediately known, and
therefore refuses to resolve it into a matter known only mediately and
through mind. It accepts an external world, but does not believe that
our senses can ever know it as it is. All science is a charted
ignorance, and belongs to Maya ; it formulates, in ever changing
concepts and phrases, the rationale of a world in which reason is but a
part — one shifting current in</p>

<p>an interminable sea. Even the person that reasons is Maya, illusion;
what is he but a temporary conjunction of events, a passing node in the
curves of matter and mind through space and time? — and what are his
acts or his thoughts but the fulfilment of forces far antedating his
birth? Nothing is real but Brahman, that vast ocean of Being in which
every form is a moment’s wave, or a fleck of froth on the wave. Virtue
is not the quiet heroism of good works, nor any pious ecstasy; it is
simply the recognition of the identity of the self with every other self
in Brahman; morality is such living as comes from a sense of union with
all things.* “He who discerns all creatures in his Self, and his Self in
all creatures, has no disquiet thence. What delusion, what grief can he
with him?” 1 ”</p>
<p>Certain characteristic qualities which would not seem to be defects
from the Hindu point of view have kept this philosophy from exercising a
wider influence in other civilizations. Its method, its scholastic
terminology, and its Vedic assumptions handicap it in finding sympathy
among nations with other assumptions or more secularized cultures. Its
doctrine of Maya gives little encouragement to morality or active
virtue; its pessimism is a confession that it has not, despite the
theory of Karma, explained evil; and part of the effect of these systems
has been to exalt a stagnant quietism in the face of evils that might
conceivably have been corrected, or of work that cried out to be done.
None the less there is a depth in these medita- tions which by
comparison casts an air of superficiality upon the activistic
philosophies generated in more invigorating zones. Perhaps our Western
systems, so confident that “knowledge is power,” are the voices of a
once lusty youth exaggerating human ability and tenure. As our energies
tire in the daily struggle against impartial Nature and hostile Time, we
look with more tolerance upon Oriental philosophies of surrender and
peace. Hence the influence of Indian thought upon other cultures has
been greatest in the days of their weakening or decay. While Greece was
winning vic- tories she paid little attention to Pythagoras or
Parmenides; when Greece was declining, Plato and the Orphic priests took
up the doctrine of reincar- nation, while Zeno the Oriental preached an
almost Hindu fatalism and resignation; and when Greece was dying, the
Neo-Platonists and the Gnos- tics drank deep at Indian wells. The

<p>fall of Rome, and the Moslem conquest of the routes between Europe
and India, seem to have obstructed, for a millennium, the direct
interchange of Oriental and Occidental ideas. But hardly had the British
established themselves in India before editions and translations of the
Upanishads began to stir Western thought. Fichte conceived an idealism
strangely like Shankara’s; 132 Schopenhauer almost incorporated
Buddhism, the Upani - shads and the Vedanta into his philosophy; and
Schelling, in his old age, thought the Upanishads the maturest wisdom of
mankind. Nietzsche had dwelt too long with Bismarck and the Greeks to
care for India, but in the end he valued above all other ideas his
haunting notion of eternal recurrence — a variant of reincarnation.</p>
<p>In our time Europe borrows more and more from the philosophy of</p>
<p>the East,* while the East borrows more and more from the science of
the West. Another world war might leave Europe open again (as the
break-up of Alexander’s empire opened Greece, and the fall of the Roman
Republic opened Rome) — to an influx of Oriental philosophies and
faiths. The mounting insurrection of the Orient against the Occident,
the loss of those Asiatic markets that have sustained the industry and
prosperity of the West, the weakening of Europe by poverty, faction and
revolution, might make that divided continent ripe for a new religion of
celestial hope and earthly despair. Probably it is prejudice that makes
such a denouement seem inconceivable in America: quietism and
resignation do not comport with our electric atmosphere, or with the
vitality born of rich resources and a spacious terrain. Doubtless our
weather will protect us in the end.</p>
