<h4 id="chapter-vi-life-under-the-revolution">CHAPTER VI Life under the
Revolution</h4>
<p>1 789 — 99</p>
<p>I. THE NEW CLASSES</p>
<p>H ERE we stop time in its flight, and look at a people suffering
concen- trated history. Like the twenty years between Caesar’s crossing
of the Rubicon and the accession of Augustus (49-29 b.c.), the
twenty-six years between the taking of the Bastille and the final
abdication of Napoleon (1789-1815) were as rich in memorable events as
centuries had been in less convulsive and remolding periods.
Nevertheless, under the tremors of gov- ernment, the flux of
institutions, and the exaltations of genius, the elements and graces of
civilization carried on: the production and distribution of food and
goods, the quest and transmission of knowledge, the discipline of in-
stinct and character, the exchanges of affection, the mitigations of
toil and strife with art, letters, charity, games, and song; the
transmutations of imagi - nation, faith, and hope. And indeed were not
these the reality and con- tinuum of history, beside which the surface
agitations of governments and heroes were the incidental and evanescent
contours of a dream?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The peasantry. Many of them, in 1789, were still day laborers or
share- croppers, working other men’s land; but by 1793 half the soil of
France was owned by peasants, most of whom had bought their acres at
bargain prices from the confiscated properties of the Church; and all
but a few peasants had freed themselves from feudal dues. The stimulus
of ownership turned labor from drudgery into devotion, daily adding to
the surplus that built homes and comforts, churches and schools — if
only the taxgatherer could be propitiated or deceived. And taxes could
be paid with assignats — government paper money — at their face value,
while products could be sold for assignats multiplied a hundred times to
equal their nominal worth. Never had the French earth been so zealously
and fruitfully tilled.</li>
</ol>
<p>This liberation of the largest class in a now casteless society was
the most visible and lasting effect of the Revolution. These sturdy
providers became the strongest defenders of the Revolution, for it had
given them the land, which a Bourbon restoration might take away. For
the same reason they supported Napoleon, and for fifteen years gave him
half of their sons. As proud property owners they allied themselves
politically with the bour- geoisie, and served, throughout the
nineteenth century, as conservative bal- last amid the repeated
paroxysms of the state.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>I2 5</p>
<p>Pledged to equality of rights, the Convention (1793) abolished primo-
geniture, and ruled that property must be willed in equal shares to all
the testator’s children, including those born out of wedlock but
acknowledged by the father. This legislation had important results,
moral and economic: reluctant to condemn their heirs to poverty by
periodic divisions of the patrimony among many children, the French
cultivated the old arts of family limitation. The peasants remained
prosperous, but the population of France grew slowly during the
nineteenth century — from 28 million in 1800 to 39 million in 1914,
while that of Germany rose from 21 million to 67 million. 1 Prospering
on the land, French peasants were slow to move into towns and factories;
so France remained predominantly agricultural, while England and Germany
developed industry and technology, excelled in war, and dominated
Europe.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The proletariat. Poverty remained, and was most severe, among the
landless peasants, the miners, and the workers and tradesmen in the
towns. Men delved into the earth to find the metals and minerals for
industry and war; saltpeter was necessary to gunpowder, and coal
increasingly replaced wood as a generator of motive power. Towns were
bright and lively by day, dark and subdued at night, till 1793, when the
communes installed street lighting in Paris. Craftsmen worked in their
candle-lit shops; trades- men displayed, and peddlers hawked, their
goods; at the center an open market; near the summit a castle and a
church; on the outskirts a factory or two. Guilds were abolished in
1791, and the National Assembly declared that henceforth every person
was to be “free to do such business, exercise such profession, art, or
trade, as he may choose.” 2 The “Law of Le Chapel” (in 1791) forbade
workers to combine for united economic action; this pro- hibition
remained in effect till 1884. Strikes were forbidden but frequent and
sporadic. 3 The workers struggled to keep their wages from being diluted
by inflation of the currency; generally, however, they kept their wages
abreast of rising prices. 4 After the fall of Robespierre the employers
tightened their control, and the condition of the proletariat worsened.
By 1795 the sans- culottes were as poor and harassed as before the
Revolution. By 1799 they had lost faith in the Revolution, and in 1800
they submitted hopefully to the dictatorship of Napoleon.</p></li>
<li><p>The bourgeoisie triumphed in the Revolution because it had
more</p></li>
</ol>
<p>money and brains than either the aristocracy or the plebs. It
purchased from the state the most lucrative portions of the property
that had been confis- cated from the Church. Bourgeois wealth was not
tied up in immobile land; it could be transferred from place to place,
from purpose to purpose, from person to person, and from anywhere to any
legislator. The bourgeoisie could pay for troops and governments and
insurrectionary crowds. It had acquired experience in the administration
of the state; it knew how to col- lect taxes, and it influenced the
Treasury through its loans. It was more practically educated than the
nobility or the clergy, and was better equipped</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>o rule a society in which money was the circulating blood. It looked
upon poverty as the punishment for stupidity, and upon its own riches as
the just reward of application and intelligence. It took no stock in
government by sansculottes; it denounced the interruption of government
by proletarian uprisings as an intolerable impertinence. It was resolved
that when the sound and fury of revolution subsided, the bourgeoisie
would be master of the state.</p>
<p>It was in France a commercial rather than an industrial bourgeoisie.
There was no such replacement of farms by pasturage as was then driving
English peasants from their fields to the towns to form a cheap labor
force for fac- tories; and the British blockade prevented in France the
export trade that could sustain expanding industries. So the factory
system developed more slowly in France than in England. There were some
substantial capitalistic organizations in Paris, Lyons, Lille, Toulouse…
, but most French industry was still in the craft and shop stage, and
even the capitalists delegated much handwork to rural or other homes.
Except for wartime authoritarian flurries, and some Jacobin flirtations
with socialism, the Revolutionary government accepted the Physiocratic
theory of free enterprise as the most stimulating and productive
economic system. The peace treaties with Prussia in 1795 and Austria in
1797 released the restrictions upon the economy, and French capitalism,
like the English and the American, entered the nineteenth cen- tury with
the blessings of a government that governed least.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>The aristocracy had lost all power in the direction of the
economy or the government. Most of its members were still emigres,
living abroad in humiliating occupations; their properties had been
confiscated, their incomes had stopped. Of those nobles who had remained
or had returned, many were guillotined, some joined the Revolution, the
rest, till 1794, hid in precarious obscurity and repeated harassment on
their estates. Under the Directory these disabilities were lessened;
many emigres came back; some recovered part of their property; and by
1797 many voices whispered that only a monarchy, supported and checked
by a functioning aristocracy, could re- store order and security to
French life. Napoleon agreed with them, but after his own fashion, and
in his own time.</p></li>
<li><p>Religion in France, as the Revolution neared its end, was
learning to get along without the help of the state. Protestants, then
five percent of the population, were freed from all civil disabilities;
the limited freedom of wor- ship granted them by Louis XVI in 1787 was
made complete by the Consti- tution of 1791. A decree of September 28,
1791, extended all civil rights to the Jews of France, and set them on a
legal equality with all other citizens.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Catholic clergy, formerly the First Estate, now suffered from the
hostility of a Voltairean anticlerical government. The upper classes had
lost belief in the doctrines of the Church; the middle classes had
acquired most of its landed wealth; by 1793 the property of the Church,
once valued at</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>I2 7</p>
<p>wo and a half billion livres,® had been sold to its enemies. In Italy
the Papacy had been deprived of its states and their revenues, and Pius
VI had been made a prisoner. Thousands of French priests had fled to
other countries, and many of them were living on Protestant alms. 6
Hundreds of churches had been closed, or had had their treasures
confiscated. Church bells had been silenced or melted down. Voltaire and
Diderot, Helvetius and d’Hol - bach had apparently won their war against
the Church.</p>
<p>The victory was not clear. The Church had lost its wealth and
political power, but its vital roots remained in the loyalty of the
clergy and the needs and hopes of the people. Many males in the large
cities had strayed from the faith; yet nearly all became churchgoers for
a day on Christmas and Easter; and at the height of the Revolution (May,
1793), when a priest carried the consecrated Host along a Paris street,
all onlookers (an eyewit- ness reported) — “men, women, and children—
fell on their knees in adora- tion.” 7 Even skeptics must have felt the
mesmerism of the ceremony, the never- fading beauty of the tale; and
they may have pondered Pascal’s “wager”— that one would be wise to
believe, since in the end the believer would lose nothing, unbelievers
everything, if proved wrong.</p>
<p>Under the Directory the French nation was divided between a people
slowly returning to its traditional faith and a government resolved to
estab- lish, by law and education, a purely secular civilization. On
October 8, 1798, the purged and newly radical Directory sent to all
teachers in the de- partmental schools the following instructions:</p>
<p>You must exclude from your teaching all that relates to the dogmas or
rites of any religion or sect whatever. The Constitution certainly
tolerates them, but the teaching of them is not part of public
instruction, nor can it ever be. The Constitution is founded on the
basis of universal morality; and it is this morality of all times, all
places, all religions — this law engraven on the tablets of the human
family — it is this that must be the soul of your teaching, the ob- ject
of your precepts, and the connecting link of your studies, as it is the
bind- ing knot of society. 8</p>
<p>Here, clearly put, -&lt;vas one of the most difficult enterprises of
the Revolu- tion, as it is one of the difficult problems of our time: to
build a social order upon a system of morality independent of religious
belief. Napoleon was to judge the proposal impracticable; America was to
cleave to it till our time.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Education. So the state took control of the schools from the Church,
and strove to make them the nursery of intelligence, morality, and
patriot- ism. On April 21, 1792, Condorcet, as chairman of public
instruction,</li>
</ol>
<p>presented to the Legislative Assembly an historic report pleading for
the reorganization of education , so that the “ever -increasing progress
of en- lightenment may open an inexhaustible source of aid to our needs,
of reme-</p>
<p>dies for our ills, of means to individual happiness and common
prosperity.” 9 War delayed the implementation of this ideal, but on May
4, 1793, Con-</p>
<p>dorcet renewed the appeal, though on a narrower basis. “The country,”
he</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>said, “has a right to bring up its own children; it cannot confide
this trust to family pride nor to the prejudices of individuals….
Education [should be] common and equal for all French people…. We stamp
upon it a great character, analogous to the nature of our government and
the sublime doc- trines of our republic.” 7 * * 10 This formulation
seemed to substitute one form of indoctrination for another —
nationalist instead of Catholic; nationalism was to be the official
religion. On October 28, 1793, the Convention ordained that no
ecclesiastic could be appointed as teacher in state schools. On De-
cember 19 it proclaimed that all primary schools were to be free, and
at- tendance at them was made compulsory on all boys. Girls were
expected to get education from their mothers, or from convents or
tutors.</p>
<p>The reorganization of secondary schools had to wait for peace; even
so, on February 25, 1794, the Convention began to establish those
“Ecoles Cen - trales” which were to be the departmental lycees, or high
schools, of the future. Special schools were opened for mines, public
works, astronomy, music, arts and crafts; and on September 28, 1794, the
ficole Polytechnique began its prestigious career. The French Academy
was suppressed on Au- gust 8, 1793, as an asylum of old reactionaries,
but on October 25, 1795, the Convention inaugurated the Institut
National de France, which was to in- clude various academies for the
encouragement and regulation of all sci- ences and arts. Here gathered
the scientists and scholars who carried on the intellectual traditions
of the Enlightenment, and gave lasting significance to Napoleon’s foray
into Egypt.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The “ Fourth Estate ”— the journalists and the press — may have been
more influential than the schools in forming the mind and the mood of
France in these effervescent years. The people of Paris — and, somewhat
less</li>
</ol>
<p>so, of France — swallowed newsprint greedily every day. Satirical
sheets pros- pered, goring politicians and pundits to the delight of the
commonalty. The Revolution, in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, had
pledged itself to maintain the freedom of the press; it did so
throughout the rule of the Na- tional and Constituent Assemblies
(1789-91); but as the heat of party strife rose, each side signalized
its victories by limiting the publications of its enemies; in effect the
liberty of the press died with the execution of the</p>
<p>King (January 21, 1793). On March 18 the Convention decreed death
for</p>
<p>“whosoever should propose an agrarian law, or any law subversi ve of
terri- torial, commercial, or industrial property”; and on March 29 the
triumphant regicides persuaded the Convention to decree death for
“whosoever should be convicted of having composed or printed works or
writings which might</p>
<p>provoke the… reestablishment of royalty, or any other power injurious
to the sovereignty of the people.” 11 Robespierre had long defended the
free - dom of the press, but after sending Hebert, Danton, and
Desmoulins to the guillotine he put an end to the journals that had
supported them. During the Terror all liberty of speech disappeared,
even in the Convention. The Directory restored freedom of the press in
1796, but revoked it a year later</p>

<p>LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>I2 9</p>
<p>after the coup d’etat of the 18th Fructidor, and deported the editors
of forty-two journals. 12 Liberty of speech and press was not destroyed
by Na- poleon; it was dead when he came to power. 13</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE NEW MORALITY</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Morality and Law</li>
</ol>
<p>Having discarded the religious basis of morals — love and fear of a
watch- ful, recording, rewarding, and punishing God, and obedience to
laws and commandments ascribed to him — the liberated spirits of France
found them- selves with no defense, except through the ethical echoes of
their abandoned creeds, against their oldest, strongest, most
individualistic instincts, ingrained in them by primitive centuries of
hunger, greed, insecurity, and strife. Leav- ing the Christian ethic to
their wives and daughters, they cast about for a new conception that
might serve as a moral anchor in a sea of turbulent indi- viduals who
feared nothing but force. They hoped to find this in civisme —
citizenship in the sense of accepting the duties as well as the
privileges of belonging to an organized and protective society; in every
moral choice the individual, in return for that protection and many
communal services, must recognize the good of the community to be the
overriding law — salus populi suprema lex. It was a noble attempt to
establish a natural ethic. Going back across Christian centuries, the
philosopher deputies — Mirabeau, Condorcet, Vergniaud, Roland,
Saint-Just, Robespierre — discovered in classical history or legend the
models they sought: Leonidas, Epaminondas, Aristides, the Brutuses,
Catos, and Scipios; these were men to whom patriotism was the sovereign
obligation, so that a man might righteously kill his children or his
parents if he thought it necessary for the good of the state.</p>
<p>The first round of revolutionaries fared reasonably well with the new
morality. The second round began on August 10, 1792: the Paris populace
deposed Louis XVI, and assumed the irresponsible absolutism of power.
Under the Old Regime some graces of the aristocracy, some touches of the
humanitarianism preached by philosophers and saints, had mitigated the
nat- ural tendencies of men to despoil and attack one another; but now
there followed, in macabre procession, the September Massacres, the
execution of the King and the Queen, and the spread of the Terror and
the guillotine in what one victim, Mme. Roland, described as “a vast
Golgotha of carnage.” 14 The Revolutionary leaders became profiteers of
war, making the liberated regions pay liberally for the Rights of Man;
the French armies were told to live on the conquered regions; the art
treasures of the liberated or the de- feated belonged to victorious
France. Meanwhile legislators and army offi- cers connived with
suppliers to cheat the government and the troops. In the laissez-faire
economy, producers, distributors, and consumers labored to mulct one
another, or to evade the maximum allowable price or wage. These</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>or analogous deviltries had of course existed for some millenniums
before the Revolution; but in the attempt to control them the new
morality of civisme seemed as helpless as the fear of the gods.</p>
<p>As the Revolution increased the insecurity of life and the
instability of laws, the rising tensions in the people expressed
themselves in crime, and sought distraction in gambling. Duels
continued, but less frequently than be- fore. Gambling was forbidden by
edicts of 1791 and 1792, but secret maisons de jeu multiplied, and by 1
794 there were three thousand gambling houses in Paris. 15 During the
upper-class affluence of the Directory years men wagered large sums, and
many families were ruined by the turn of the wheel. In 1796 the
Directory entered the game by restoring the Loterie Nationale. In a pe-
tition to the Convention the Tuileries section of the Paris Commune
asked for a law suppressing all gambling houses and brothels. “Without
morals,” it argued, “there can be no law and order; without personal
safety, no lib- erty.” 16</p>
<p>The Revolutionary governments labored to give a new system of laws to
a people excitable, violent, and left morally and legally unmoored by
the decline of faith and the death of the King. Voltaire had called for
a total re- vision of French law, and a unifying reconciliation of the
360 provincial or district codes into one coherent digest for all of
France. That call was not heard amid the uproar of revolution; it had to
wait for Napoleon. In 1780 the Academy of Chalons-sur-Marne offered a
prize for the best essay on “The Best Way of Mitigating the Harshness of
French Penal Law Without Endangering Public Safety.” 17 Louis XVI
responded by abolishing torture (1780), and in 1788 he announced his
intention to have all French criminal law revised into a consistent
national code; moreover, “we shall seek all means of mitigating the
severity of punishments without compromising good order.” The
conservative lawyers then dominating the parlements of Paris, Metz, and
Besan^on opposed the plan, and the King, fighting for his life, laid it
aside.</p>
<p>The cahiers presented to the States-General of 1789 appealed for
several legal reforms: trials should be public, the accused should be
allowed the help of counsel, lettres de cachet should be banned, trial
by jury should be estab- lished. In June the King announced an end to
lettres de cachet, and the other reforms were soon made law by the
Constituent Assembly. The jury system, which had existed in medieval
France, was restored. The legislators were now sufficiently immune to
ecclesiastical influence, and alert to business needs, to proclaim,
October 3, 1789 (centuries after the fact), that the charging of
interest was not a crime. Two laws of 1794 freed all slaves in France
and her colonies, and gave Negroes the rights of French citizens. On the
ground that “an absolutely free state cannot allow any corporation</p>

<p>The diversity of old legislation, the enactment of new laws, and
the</p>
<p>growing complexity of business relations fostered the multiplication
of law- yers, who now replaced the clergy as the first estate. Since the
dissolution of the parlements they were not formally organized, but
their knowledge of the law in all its loopholes, and of legal procedure
in all its devices and de- lays, gave them a power which the state —
itself a conglomerate of lawyers — found it hard to con trol. Citizens
began to protest against the law’s delays, the subtleties of attorneys,
and the expensive legislation that made exasper- atingly unreal the
equality of all citizens before the courts. 18 The successive assemblies
tried various measures to reduce the number and the power of the
attorneys. In a fury of antilawyer laws they suppressed notaries
(September 23, 1791), closed all schools of law (September 15, 1793),
and decreed (Oc- tober 24, 1793): “The off ice of attorney-at-law is
abolished, but litigants may empower mere mandatories to represent
them.” 19 These regulations, often evaded, remained on the books until
Napoleon reinstated the attorneys on March 1 8, 1 800.</p>
<p>The Revolution made better headway in reforming the criminal code.
Procedure was made more public; there was to be an end (for a while) to
secrecy of examinations and anonymity of witnesses. Prisons ceased to be
prime instruments of torture; in many prisons the inmates were allowed
to bring in books and furniture, and to pay for imported meals; persons
jailed as suspects, but not yet convicted, might visit one another, play
games, 20 and at least play at love; we hear of some warm affairs, like
that of prisoner Jose- phine de Beauharnais with prisoner General Hoche.
The Convention, which had sanctioned hundreds of executions, announced
at its final session (Octo- ber 26, 1795): “The penalty of death will be
abolished throughout the French Republic from the day of the
proclamation of peace.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Revolution could claim that it had improved the method
of capital punishment. In 1789 Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, member of
the States-General, proposed to replace the hangman and the axe man with
a massive mechanical blade whose fall would separate a man from his head
be- fore he had any time to feel physical pain. The idea was not new; it
had been used in Italy and Germany since the thirteenth century. 21
After some experimental use of the doctor’s knife on dead bodies, the
“guillotine” was erected (April 25, 1792) in the Place de Greve (now the
Place de la Hotel de Ville) and then elsewhere, and executions were
accelerated. For a time they attracted large crowds, some of them merry,
and including women and children; 22 but soon they were so frequent that
they became a negligible commonplace; “people,” reported a contemporary,
“just went on working in their shops, when the tumbrils passed, not even
bothering to raise their heads.” 23 Lowered heads lasted l ongest.</p>

<p>he slums, charity eased pain and grief, goodness countered evil, and
paren- tal affection survived filial independence. Many sons wondered at
parental inability to understand their revolutionary ardor and new ways;
some of them threw off the old moral restraints, and became careless
epicureans. Promiscuity flourished, venereal disease spread, foundlings
multiplied, per- versions floundered on.</p>
<p>Comte Donatien- Alphonse-F rangois de Sade (1740-1814) came of a
high- placed Provencal family, rose to be governor general of the
districts Bresse and Bugey, and seemed destined for the life of a
provincial administrator. But he seethed and fermented with sexual
imagery and desires, and sought for a philosophy that might justify
them. After an affair involving four girls, he was sentenced to death at
Aix-en- Provence (1772) for “crimes of poison - ing and sodomy.” 24 He
escaped, was captured, escaped, committed further enormities, fled to
Italy, returned to France, was arrested in Paris, was im- prisoned in
Vincennes (1778-84), in the Bastille, and at Charenton (1789). Released
in 1790, he supported the Revolution; in 1792 he was secretary of the
Section des Piques. During the Terror he was arrested on the false as-
sumption that he was a returned emigre. He was released after a year,
but in 1801, under Napoleon, he was imprisoned for having published
Justine (1791) and Juliette (1792). These were novels of sexual
experience, normal and abnormal; the author preferred the abnormal, and
spent his considerable literary skill in defending it; all sexual
desires, he argued, are natural, and should be indulged with a clear
conscience, even to deriving erotic pleasure from the infliction of
pain; in this last sense he became immortal with a word. He spent the
last years of his life in various prisons, wrote clever plays, and died
in the insane asylum at Charenton.</p>
<p>We hear of homosexuality among college students during the Revolu-
tion, 25 and may presume its popularity in jails. Prostitutes and
brothels were especially numerous near the Palais-Royal, in the Gardens
of the Tuileries, in the Rue St.-Hilaire and the Rue des Petits Champs;
they could be found also at theaters and the opera, and even in the
galleries of the Legislative As- sembly and the Convention. Pamphlets
were circulated giving the addresses and fees of houses and women. On
April 24, 1793, the Temple section issued an order: “The General
Assembly,… desiring to put a stop to the incal - culable misfortune
caused by the dissoluteness of public morals, and by the lubricity and
immodesty of the female sex, hereby nominates commis- sioners,” etc. 26
Other sections took up the campaign; private patrols were formed, and
some careless offenders were arrested. Robespierre supported the effort,
but after his death the assiduity of the guardians relaxed, the filles
reappeared, and prospered under the Directory, when women of wide sexual
experience became leaders of fashion and society.</p>
<p>The evil may have been mitigated by the increasing facility of early
mar- riage. No priest was necessary; after September 20, 1792, only
civil mar- riage was legal; and this required merely a mutual pledge
signed before a civil authority. In the lower classes there were many
cases of a couple living</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 1 33</p>
<p>ogether unwed and unmolested. Bastards were plentiful; in 1796 France
re- corded 44,000 foundlings. 27 Between 1789 and 1839, twenty-four
percent of all brides in the typical town of Meulan were pregnant when
they came to the altar. 28 As in the Ancien Regime, adultery in the
husband was often con- doned; men of means were likely to have
mistresses, and under the Direc- tory these were displayed as openly as
wives. Divorce was legalized by a decree of September 20, 1792;
thereafter it could be obtained through mu- tual agreement before a
municipal officer.</p>
<p>Paternal authority was lessened by the moderate growth of women’s
legal rights, and still more by the self-assertion of emancipated youth.
Anne Plumptre, who traveled in France in 1802, reported a gardener as
telling her:</p>
<p>“During the Revolution we dared not scold our children for their
faults. Those who called themselves patriots regarded it as against the
fundamental principles of liberty to correct children. This made these
so unruly that very often, when a parent presumed to scold his child,
the latter would tell him to mind his own business, adding, ‘We are free
an d equal; the Republic is our only father, and no other.’… It will
take a good many years to bring them back to minding.” 29</p>
<p>Pornographic literature abounded, and (according to a contemporary
news- paper) was the favorite reading of the young. 30 Some previously
radical parents began by 1795 (as in 1871) to send their sons to schools
directed by priests, in the hope of saving them from the general
loosening of manners and morals. 31 For a time it seemed that the family
must be a casualty of the French Revolution, but the restoration of
discipline under Napoleon re- prieved it until the Industrial Revolution
fell upon it with more gradual but more sustained and fundamental
force.</p>
<p>Women had held a high place in the Old Regime through the grace and
refining influence of their manners, and by the cultivation of their
minds; but these developments were mostly confined to the aristocracy
and the upper middle class. By 1789, however, the women of the
commonalty visi- bly emerged into politics; they almost made the
Revolution by marching to Versailles and bringing King and Queen back to
Paris as the captives of a commune bursting with its newly discovered
power.* In July, 1790, Con- dorcet published an article “On th e
Admission of Women to the Rights of the State.” In December an attempt
was made by a Mme. Aelders to estab - lish clubs devoted to woman’s
liberation. 32 Women made themselves heard in the galleries of the
Assemblies, but attempts to organize them for the ad- vancement of their
political rights were lost in the excitement of war, the fury of the
Terror, and the conservative reaction after Thermidor. Some gains were
made: the wife, like the husband, could sue for divorce, and the
mother’s consent, as well as the father’s, was required for the marriage
of her children under age. 33 Under the Directory, women, though
voteless, be-</p>

<p>came an open power in politics, promoting ministers and generals, and
proudly displaying their new freedom in manners, morals, and dress.
Napo- leon, aged twenty-six, described them in 1 7 9 5 :</p>
<p>The women are everywhere — at plays, on public walks, in libraries.
You see very pretty women in the scholar’s study room. Only here [in
Paris], of all the places on earth, do women deserve such influence, and
indeed the men are mad about them, think of nothing else, and live only
through and for them. A woman, in order to know what is due her, and
what power she has, must live in Paris for six months. 34</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Like almost everything else, manners felt the swing of the pendulum
to re- volt and return. As the aristocracy fled before the leveling
storm they took with them their lordly titles, courteous address,
perfumed language, flowery signatures, confident ease, and leisurely
grace. Soon the suavity of the salon, the decorum of the dance, and the
diction of the Academy became stigmata of the nobility, which might
incur, for their practitioners, detention as sus - pect antediluvians
who had escaped the flood. 35 By the end of 1792 all Frenchmen in France
had become citoyens, all Frenchwomen citoyennes, in careful equality; no
one was Monsieure d or Madamed-, and the courtly vous of singular
address was replaced by the tu and toi of the home and the street.
Nevertheless, as early as 1795, this tutoiement was passing out of
style, vous was back in fashion, Monsieur and Madame were displacing
Citoyen and Citoyenne. 36 Under Napoleon, titles reappeared; by 1810
there were more of them than ever before.</p>
<p>Dress changed more slowly. The well-to-do male had long since
adopted, and now refused to discard, the once noble accouterment of the
three- cornered high-crowned hat, silk shirt, flowing bow tie, colored
and em- broidered waistcoat, full-dress coat reaching to the knee,
breeches ending at various levels below the knees, silk stockings, and
square-toed buckled shoes. In 1793 the Committee of Public Safety tried
to “modify the present na - tional costume, so as to render it
appropriate to republican habits and the character of the Revolution”;
37 but only the lower middle class adopted the long trousers of the
workingmen and tradesmen. Robespierre himself con- tinued to dress like
a lord, and nothing surpassed in splendor the official cos- tumes of the
Directors, paced by Barras. Not till 1830 did pantaloons win the battle
against knee breeches {culottes). Only the sansculottes wore the red
bonnet of revolution, and the carmagnole.*</p>
<p>The dress of women was affected by the Revolution’s belief that it
was following in the footsteps of republican Rome and Periclean Greece.
Jacques-Louis David, who dominated French art from 1789 to 1815,
took</p>

<p>135</p>
<p>classic heroes for his early subjects, and dressed them in classic
styles. So the fashionable women of Paris, after the fall of the puritan
Robespierre, discarded petticoats and chemises, and adopted as their
principal garment a simple flowing gown transparent enough to reveal
most of the soft contours that charmed the never satiated male. The
waistline was unusually high, sup- porting the breasts; the neckline was
low enough to offer an ample sample; and the sleeves were short enough
to display enticing arms. Caps were re- placed by bandeaux, and
high-heeled shoes by heelless slippers. Doctors re- ported the deaths of
gaily dressed women who had been exposed, at the theater or on
promenade, to the quickly falling temperature of Paris eve- nings. 38
Meanwhile the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses — Unbelievable male and
Marvelous female dandies — labored to win attention by extravagant garb.
One group of women, appearing in male attire before the Council of the
Paris Communes in 1792, received a gentle reprimand from Chaumette, its
procureur general: “You rash women, who want to be men, aren’t you
content with your lot as it is? What more do you want? You dominate our
senses; the legislator and the magistrate are at your feet, your
despotism is the only one our strength cannot combat, because it is the
despotism of love, and consequently a work of nature. In the name of
that very nature, remain as nature intended you.” 39</p>
<p>Women, however, were sure they could improve upon nature. In an ad-
vertisement in the Moniteur for August 15, 1792, Mme. Broquin announced
that she had not yet run out of her “famous powder for dyeing red or
white hair chestnut or black, on a single application.” 40 If necessary,
unsatisfactory hair was covered with a wig — made, in many cases, from
the cut tresses of guillotined young women. 41 In 1796 it was quite
ordinary for men of the upper and middle strata to wear their hair long
and in a braid. 42</p>
<p>During the first two years of the Revolution the 800,000 population
of Paris carried on its usual life, with only incidental attention to
what was go- ing on in the Assembly or the jails. Life was pleasant
enough then for the upper classes: families continued to exchange visits
and dinners, to attend dances, parties, concerts, and plays. Even during
the violent period between the September Massacres of 1792 and the fall
of Robespierre in July 1794, when there were 2,800 executions in Paris,
life for nearly all the sur- vivors went its customary round of work and
play, of sexual pursuit and parental love. Sebastien Mercier reported in
1794:</p>
<p>Foreigners reading our newspapers imagine us all covered with blood,
in rags, and living wretched lives. Judge of their surprise when they
reach that magnificent avenue in the Champs Elysees, on either side of
which are elegant phaetons and charming, lovely women; and then… that
magical perspective opening out over the Tuileries and… those splendid
gardens, now more luxuriant and better tended than ever ! 43</p>
<p>There were games — ball games, tennis, riding, horse races, athletic
con- tests… There were amusement parks like the Tivoli Gardens, where —
like twelve thousand others on a pleasant day — you could get your
fortune told, buy dispensables in the boutiques, watch fireworks,
tight-rope walkers, or</p>

<p>balloon ascensions, hear concerts, or put your youngsters on the
merry-go- round to play the jeu de bagues (catching the rings). You
might sit in an open-air cafe, or under the pavilion of the Cafe de Foy,
or in a high-class cafe like Tortoni’s or Frascati’s, or follow the
tourists into night spots like the Caveau (Cellar), or the Sauvage, or
Les Aveugles (where blind musi- cians entertained). You could go to a
club to read or chat or hear political debate. You could attend one of
the complex and colorful festivals organized by the state and decorated
by famous artists like David. If you wished to try the new dance — the
waltz — just imported from Germany, you could find a partner in some one
of the three hundred public ballrooms in the Paris of the Directory.
44</p>
<p>Now (1795), in the subsiding years of the Revolution, some Emigres
were allowed to return; hidden nobles ventured from their protective
lairs, and the bourgeoisie displayed its wealth in expensive homes and
furniture, in jeweled women and lavish entertainments. The people of
Paris emerged from their apartments and tenements to sample the sun or
the evening air in the gardens of the Tuileries or the Luxembourg, or
along the Champs-Llysees. Women blossomed out in their recklessly
charming costumes, their pictured fans that said more than words, their
gracefully shaped shoes that made con- cealed feet alluring. “Society”
revived.</p>
<p>But the hundred or so families that now constituted it were not the
pedi- greed gentry and world-famous philosophies who had sparkled in the
salons of pre-Revolution nights; they were mostly the nouveaux-riches
who had garnered livres from ecclesiastical realty, army contracts,
mercantile mo- nopolies, financial finesse, or political friends. Some
scattered survivors from Bourbon days came to the homes of Mme. de
Genlis or the widows Con- dorcet and Helvetius; but most of the salons
that opened after the death of Robespierre (Mme. de Stael’s circle
excepted) had no talent for brilliant conversation, and lacked the ease
that in older times had come from long security in landed wealth. The
top salon now was the one that met in the comfortable rooms of Director
Barras in the Luxembourg Palace, or at his Chateau de Grosbois; and its
allure was not in the lore of philosophers but in the beauty and smiles
of Mmes. Tallien and Josephine de Beauharnais.</p>
<p>Josephine was not yet Bonaparte, and Mme. Tallien was no longer Tal-
lien’s wife. Married to him on December 26, 1794, and acclaimed for a
while as “Notre Dame de Thermidor,” she had left the fading Terrorist
soon afterward, and had become the mistress of Barras. Some journalists
gibed at her morals, but most of them returned her smiles, for there was
nothing haughty in her beauty, and she was known for many kindnesses to
women as well as to men. The Duchesse d’Abrantes described her later as
“the Capi - toline Venus, but even more lovely than the work of
Pheidias; for you per- ceived in her the same perfection of features,
the same symmetry in arms, hands, and feet, the whole animated by a
benevolent expression.” 45 * It was one virtue of Barras that he was
generous to her and to Josephine, appreciated</p>

<p>heir beauty in no merely sexual way, shared it, in his receptions,
with hun- dreds of potential rivals, and put his blessing upon Nap
oleon’s capture of Josephine.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MUSIC AND DRAMA</li>
</ol>
<p>Every grade of music flourished. You could get encores from a street
singer for a coin, or you could join a crowd and frighten the bourgeois
with “The Carmagnole” or “£a ira,” or you could shake the frontiers with
“The Marseillaise,” of which Rou - get de Lisle had written all but the
title. In the Concert-Feydeau you could marvel at Dominique Garat, the
Caruso of his time, whose voice could evoke tremors in hearts and
rafters, and was famous throughout Europe for its range. Amid the Terror
of 1793 the Convention inaugurated the Institut National de Musique, and
two years later it expanded this into the Conservatoire de Musique,
granting it 240,000 livres per year for the free tuition of six hundred
students. On the night when Robespierre was shot a Parisian could have
heard Armide at the Opera, or Paul et Virginie at the Opera-Comique.
46</p>
<p>Opera flourished during the Revolution. Besides putting Bernardin de
Saint- Pierre’s idyl to music in 1794, Jean-Frangois Lesueur (1760-1837)
scored another success, in the same year, with Fenelon’s Telemaque; he
aroused all France with the noise and terror of La Caverne , which
received seven hundred performances; he continued to produ ce during
Napoleon’s ascendancy, and lived long enough to teach Berlioz and
Gounod. In a much shorter life Etienne Mehul (1763-1817) wrote over
forty operas for the Opera-Comique, while his massive chorales — Hymne a
la raison (1793) and Chant du depart (1794) — made him the musical idol
of the Revolution.*</p>
<p>The greatest music-maker in the France of the Revolution was Maria
Luigi Carlo Salvatore Cherubini. Born in Florence in 1760, “I began to
learn music at six, and composition at nine.” 48 By the age of sixteen
he had composed three Masses, a Mag- nificat, a Te Deum, an oratorio,
and three cantatas. In 1777 Leopold, the benevolent grand duke of
Tuscany, granted him an allowance to study with Giuseppe Sarti at
Bologna; in four years Cherubini became a master of contrapuntal
composition. In 1784 he was invited to London, but he did not do well,
and in 1786 he moved to Paris, which, except for short intervals,
remained his home till his death in 1842. In his first opera there,
Demophon (1788), he abandoned the lighthearted Neapolitan style of
subordinating the story and the orchestra to arias, and followed Gluck
into “grand opera,” in which the arias were kept secondary to the
development of the theme, and to choral and orchestral music. His
greatest successes in the Paris of the Revolution were Lodoiska (1791)
and Medee (1797). With his still more famous Les Deux Journees (1800) he
began a troubled career under Napoleon. We may rejoin him under that
shooting star.</p>
<p>There were over thirty theaters in Revolutionary Paris, and nearly
all were crowded night after night, even during the Terror. Actors had
been freed by the Revolution from the disabilities long since laid upon
them by the Church; they could smile at excommunications, and at the
exclu- * During the Revolution the term opera-comique ceased to mean a
musical comedy, and was applied to any opera, tragic or comic, that
contained spoken dialogue. 47 The Theatre de rOpera-Comique was
henceforth allowed to compete with the Academie de Musique in pro-
ducing “serious” opera. About this time, too, some composers, like Mehul
in Ariodant (1799), arranged to associate certain recurring orchestral
passages with corresponding personages or situations; so began the
leitmotif.</p>
<p>i 3 8</p>

<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>sion of their cadavers from Christian cemeteries. But they were
subjected (1790-95) to a more alert censorship: the Convention required
that no comedy should contain any aristocratic hero or sentiments; the
theater was made an instrument of government propaganda. Comedy sank to
a low level, and new tragedies followed the revolutionary line as well
as the classic unities.</p>
<p>As usual the leading actors were more famous than the statesmen, and
some, like Francois- Joseph Talma, were much more loved. His father was
a valet who became a dentist, went to London, prospered, and sent his
son to France for an education. After graduation Francis returned to
serve as as- sistant to his father. He learned English, read
Shakespeare, saw him per- formed, and joined a troupe of French actors
playing in England. Back in France, he was admitted to the Comedie-F
rangaise, and made his debut in 1787 as Selde in Voltaire’s Mahomet. His
well -proportioned figure, his clas- sically chiseled features, his
thick black hair and brilliant black eyes, helped him to advance, but
his support of the Revolution alienated most of the company, which owed
its existence to the favor of the King.</p>
<p>In 1785 Talma saw Davi d’s picture The Oath of the Horatii ; he
was</p>
<p>struck not only by its dramatic power but by its careful fidelity to
ancient dress. He resolved to introduce the same veracity into the
costumes for his stage appearances. He astonished his confreres when he
appeared in tunic and sandals, and with bare arms and legs, to play
Proculus in Voltaire’s Brutus.</p>
<p>He became friends with David, and absorbed some of his revolutionary
ardor. When he played Marie- Joseph de Chenier’s Charles IX (November
4,</p>
<ol start="1789" type="1">
<li>he put such passion into the antimonarchical passages — which pic-
tured the young King as ordering the Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Eve—
that he shocked most of his audience, and many of his companions, who
still felt some loyalty to Louis XVI. As the Revolution warmed, the
conflict be- tween the “Reds” and the “Blacks” in the company and in the
audience became so violent — leading to duels — that Talma, Mme. Vestris
(the leading tragedienne), and other actors broke away from the royally
privileged Comedie-Framjaise, and set up their own company in the
Theatre de la R6publique Fran§aise near the Palais-Royal. There Talma
improved his art bp studying the history, character, and dress of each
person and period in his repertoire. He practiced control of his
features to accompany every change of feeling or thought; he reduced the
declamatory tone of his speeches and the theatrical expression of
emotion; eventually he became the acknowledged master of his art.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1793 the older company, renamed the Theatre de la Nation, produced
VAnri des lots, a play salted with satire and ridicule of the
Revolutionary leaders. On the night of September 3-4 the whole troupe
was arrested. Talma’s company accepted a rigid censorship: the plays of

<p>After the fall of Robespierre the arrested actors were released. On
May 31, 1799, as the Revolution neared its end, the old company and the
new were united in the Comedie-F rangaise, and made their home in the
Theatre- Frangais of the Palais-Royal, where it lives and prospers
today.</p>
<p>V. THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>Art in Revolutionary France was affected by three external events:
the deposition and emigration of the aristocracy; the excavations of
ancient re- mains at Herculaneum and Pompeii (1738 fr. ) ; and the rape
of Italian art by Napoleon. The emigration removed from France most of
the class with enough money and taste to buy works of art; and sometimes
the artist, like Mme. Vigee-Lebrun, followed the emigres. Fragonard,
though completely dependent on the purses of the leisure class,
supported the Revolution, and nearly starved. Other artists supported it
because they remembered how the nobility had treated them as servants
and hirelings, and how the Academie des Beaux-Arts had permitted only
its own members to exhibit in its Salons. In 1791 the Legislative
Assembly had opened the Academie to any quali- fied artist, French or
foreign, to compete. The Convention abolished the Academie altogether as
an essentially aristocratic institution; in 1795 the Directory replaced
it with a new Academie des Beaux-Arts, and gave it headquarters in the
Louvre. This had been made a public museum (1792); there the French
artists were allowed to study and copy the works of Raphael, Giorgione,
Correggio, Leonardo, Veronese,… even the horses of St. Mark’s; never had
stolen goods been so commendably used. In 1793 the Convention renewed
the government’s support of the Prix de Rome, and of the French Academy
in Rome. Slowly the rising middle class replaced the nobility as buyers
of art; the Salon of 1795 was crowded with specta- tors, overwhelmed by
535 paintings. Art prices rose.</p>
<p>Strange to say, the Revolution did not bring any radical movement in
the arts. On the contrary, the inspiration given to neoclassicism by the
exhuming of ancient sculpture and architecture near Naples, and by the
writings of Winckelmann (1755 ff.) and Lessing (1766), had stimulated a
revival of the classic style, with all its aristocratic connotations,
and this reaction proved strong enough to withstand the Romantic and
democratic influences of the Revolution. The artists of this leveling
age (Prud’hon dissenting) accepted</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>In 1774 Joseph-Marie Vien, excited by reports of the excavations at
Her- culaneum and Pompeii, started out for Italy, taking with him his
pupil Jacques-Louis David. The youngster, all set for revolution, vowed
that he would never be seduced by the conservative, aristocratic art of
classical antiquity. 60 But there was something masterful in him that
responded to the majesty of form, the logic of construction, the
strength and purity of line, in the art of Greece and Rome. He resisted
its masculine message for a time, gradually yielded to it, and brought
it back with him to Paris. It harmonized with the Revolution’s rejection
of Christianity a nd the idealization of the Roman Republic, of the
Catos and Scipios; it even accorded with Mme. Tal- lien’s Greek gowns.
Now it seemed due time to put aside the celestial aspira - tions of
Gothic, the juvenile surprises of baroque, the gay frills of rococo, the
rosy nudes of Boucher, the leaping petticoats of Fragonard. Now classic
line and logic, cold reason, aristocratic restraint, and stoic form must
be the art goals and principles of colorful, emotional, democratic,
romantic, revo- lutionary France.</p>
<p>David, who was to dominate French art during the Revolution and the
Empire, was bom in Paris in 1748 of a prosperous bourgeois family which
always kept him from want. He entered, at sixteen, the Academie des
Beaux- Arts, studied under Vien, tried twice for the Prix de Rome,
failed twice, locked himself up, and tried to starve himself to death. A
neighboring poet missed him, sought him, found him, and wooed him back
to food. David competed again in 1774, and won with a rococo painting,
Antiochus Dying for the Love of Stratonice. In Rome he became enamored
of Raphael, then put him aside as too femininely soft in mood and line;
he found stronger nourishment in Leonardo, and a stately control of
thought and form in Poussin. From Renaissance Madonnas he passed to
ancient heroes of phi- losophy, myth, and war; and in the capital of
Christianity he shed his Christian faith.</p>
<p>He returned to Paris in 1780, took a rich wife, and submitted in
the</p>
<p>Academie Salons a succession of classic subjects — Belisarius,
Andromache , and some portraits. In 1784 he went to Rome to paint,
against a Roman background, a picture commissioned by Louis XVI — The
Oath of the Horatii. When he exhibited this in Rome an old Italian
painter, Pompeo Batoni, told him, “Tu ed io soli, siamo pittori; pel
rimanente si puo gettarlo</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 141</p>
<p>A King sincerely dedicated to reform, and a city already stirring
with revo- lution, united in applauding the artist, and his rivals
acknowledged the skill with which he had revealed heroic courage,
paternal sacrifice, and womanly grief. The success of The Oath of the
Horatii was one of the most complete and significant in the annals of
art, for it meant the triumph of the classic style.</p>
<p>Encouraged in his method and his choice of subjects, David turned to
Greece and offered (1787) The Death of Socrates. Sir Joshua Reynolds,
viewing the picture in Paris, pronounced it “the greatest endeavor in
art since Michelangelo and Raphael; it would have been a credit to
Athens in the time of Pericles.” 53 Two years later David returned to
Roman legend with The Lictors Bringing Home to Brutus the Bodies of His
Sons; this was Livy’s tale of the Roman Consul (509 b.c.) who sentenced
his two sons to death for conspiring to restore the monarchy. The
painting had been com- missioned before the fall of the Bastille,
apparently with no thought of the impending revolt. The King’s Minister
of Art forbade its exhibition, but public clamor secured its admission
to the Salon of 1789. The crowds who came to see it hailed it as part of
the Revolution, and David found himself the artistic mouthpiece of his
time.</p>
<p>Thereafter he gave himself to the Revolution in a rare marriage of
politics and art. He accepted its principles, illustrated its incidents,
organized and adorned its fetes, and commemorated its martyrs. When the
radical deputy Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau was assassinated by a
royalist (January 20,</p>
<p>1793), David set himself to commemorate the scene; within two months
he presented the picture to the Convention, which hung it on the walls
of its chamber. When Marat was slain (July 13, 1793) a crowd of mourners
entered the Convention gallery; soon a voice from among them cried out,
“Where are you, David? You have transmitted to posterity the likeness of
Lepeletier dying for his country; there remains for you another picture
to paint.” David rose and said, “I will do it.” He presented the
completed painting to the Convention on October 1 1. It showed Marat
half submerged in his bath, his head fallen back lifeless, one hand
clasping a manuscript, an arm dropping limp to the floor. A block of
wood beside the tub bore the proud inscription “To Marat David.” It was
a departure from David’s char - acteristic style; revolutionary fervor
had replaced neoclassicism with realism. Furthermore, this and the
Lepeletier broke classic precedent by taking recent events as subjects;
they made art a participant in the Revolution. By 1794 David had become
so prominent politically that he was elected to the Committe e of
General Security. He followed Robespierre’s leader - ship, and arranged
the procession and artistic decorations for the Feast of the Supreme
Being. After Robespierre’s fall David was arrested as one of his
followers; after serving three months in prison he was released on the
pleas of his pupils. He retired in 1795 to the privacy of his studio,
but he returned to prominence in 1799 with a masterly panorama, The Rape
of the Sabines. On November 10 Napoleon seized power, and David,
fifty-one years old, began a new and triumphant career.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>Revolutions do not favor pure science, but they stimulate applied
science to meet the needs of a society fighting for its liberty. So
Lavoisier, the chemist-financier, helped the American and French
Revolutions by improv- ing the quality and production of gunpowder;
Berthollet and other chemists, spurred by the English blockade, found
substitutes for imported sugar, soda, and indigo. Lavoisier was
guillotined as a profiteer (1794), 64 but, a year later, the
Revolutionary government repudiated this act, and honored his memory.
The Convention protected the scientists on its committees, and ac-
cepted their plans for a metric system; the Directory gave scientists
high status in the new Institut de France; Lagrange, Laplace,
Adrien-Marie Le- gendre, Delambre, Berthollet, Lamarck, Cuvier — names
still shining in the history of science — were among its earliest
members. Science for a time re- placed religion as the staple of French
education; the return of the Bourbons interrupted this movement, but
their fall (1830) was accompanied by the exaltation of science in the
“positive philosophy” of Auguste Comte.</p>
<p>Lagrange and Legendre left their lasting marks on mathematics.
Lagrange formulated the “calculus of variations,” whose equations are
still part of the science of mechanics. Legendre worked on elliptic
integrals from 1786 to 1827, when he published his results in a Traite
des fonctions. Gaspard Monge, son of a peddler, invented descriptive
geometry — a method of repre- senting three-dimensional objects on a
two-dimensional plane; he organized the national reclamation of copper
and tin, wrote a famous text on the gentle art of manufacturing cannon,
and served the Revolutionary government and Napoleon through a long
career as mathematician and administrator. La- place aroused the
intelligentsia of Europe with his Exposition du systeme du monde (1796),
which formulated a nebular hypothesis and tried to ex- plain the
universe as pure mechanism; when Napoleon asked him “Who made all this”
machinery, Laplace replied, “I had no need of that hypot he- sis.”
Lavoisier, founder of modem chemistry, served as chairman of the
commission that formulated the metric system (1790). Berthollet advanced
both theoretical and practical chemistry, helped Lavoisier establish a
new chemical nomenclature, and helped his embattled country by his
method of converting ore into iron and iron into steel. Xavier Bichat
pioneered in his- tology by his microscopic studies of tissues. In 1797
he began a famous series of lectures on physiology and surgery; he
summarized his findings in Ana- tomie generate (1801). In 1799, aged
twenty-eight, he was appointed physi- cian at the Hotel-Dieu. He was
embarking upon a study of organic changes produced by disease when a
fall put an end to his life (1802) at the age of thirty-one.</p>
<p>Pierre Cabanis may serve as a transition to philosophy, for though
his time knew him chiefly as a physician, posterity came to think of him
as a philoso-</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>H3</p>
<p>pher. In 1791 he attended the last illness of the dying Mirabeau. He
lectured at the fxole de Medecine on hygiene, legal medicine, and the
history of medicine; for a time he was head of all the hospitals of
Paris. He was one of the many distinguished men who discreetly loved the
ever lovable widow of the philosophe Helvetius. At her gatherings he met
Diderot, d’Alembert, d’Holbach, Condorcet, Condillac, Franklin, and
Jefferson. As a student of medicine he was especially attracted to
Condillac, who was then dominating the French philosophical scene with
his doctrine that all knowledge comes from sensations. The materialistic
implications of this sensationism appealed to Cabanis; they accorded
well with the correlations that he had found be- tween mental and bodily
operations. He shocked even the advanced thinkers of his time by saying:
“To form a correct idea of the operations whose re - sult is thought, it
is necessary to regard the brain as a special organ</p>
<p>whose particular function is to produce thought, just as the stomach
and the intestines have the special function of carrying on the work of
digestion, the liver that of filtering the bile, etc.” 55</p>
<p>Nevertheless Cabanis modified Condillac’s analysis by maintaining (as
Kant had recently done in his Critique of Pure Reason) that a sensation
enters an organism which is already half formed at birth, is molded
thereafter by every experience, and carries its past in its cells and
memories to form part of a changing personality, including internal
sensations, reflexes, instincts, feelings, and desires. The
psychophysical totality so produced molds to its structure and purpose
every sensation that it receives. In this sense Cabanis agreed with Kant
that the mind is not a helpless tabula rasa upon which sen- sations are
impressed; it is an organization for transforming sensations into
perceptions, thoughts, and actions. However (Cabanis insisted), the mind
that Kant so revered is not an entity separable from the physiological
appa- ratus of tissues and nerves.</p>
<p>This apparently materialistic system was expounded in the first
(1796) of twelve memoir es which Cabanis published together in 1802 as
Rapports du physique et du moral de Thomme. They reveal a powerful mind
(or brain) eagerly active over a widening area of curiosity and
speculation. The first essay is almost a survey of physiological
psychology, studying the neu- ral correlates of mental states. The third
analyzes the “unconscious”: our accumulated memories (or neural
inscriptions) may combine with external and internal sensations to
generate dreams, or may unconsciously affect our ideas even in the most
alert of waking states. The fourth holds that the mind ages wit h the
body, so that the same person’s ideas and character may be quite
different in his seventies than in his twenties. The fifth is a
suggestive discussion of how glandular secretions — especially the
sexual — may affect our feelings and thoughts. The tenth essay contends
that man has evolved through chance variations or mutations which became
hereditary.</p>
<p>In a book purporting to be Cabanis’ Lettres sur les causes premieres
(1824), published sixteen years after his death, he appears to retract
his ma- terialism, and to admit a First Cause endowed with intelligence
and will. 58 The materialist may remind us that the great surgeon had
warned us against</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>he effect of an aging body upon its associated mind. The skeptic may
sup- pose that the mystery of consciousness had led Cabanis to suspect
material- ism of simplifying a very complex and immediate reality. In
any event it is good that a philosopher should remind himself, now and
then, that he is a particle pontificating on infinity.</p>
<p>Two men survived from the age of the philosophes to meet in person
the Revolution that had been so fervently desired. When the Abbe Raynal,
who had made his name in 1770 with Histoire philosophique… des deux
Indes, saw the lumieres of the Enlightenment darkened by the excesses of
the populace, he sent to the Constituent Assembly, on May 31, 1791, a
letter of protest and prophecy. “I have long dared to tell kings of
their duties; let me today tell the people of their errors.” He warned
that the tyranny of the crowd could be as cruel and unjust as the
despotism of monarchs. He defended the right of the clergy to preach
religion, so long as the opponents of religion or priestcraft were left
free to speak their ifiinds. He condemned alike the governmental
financing of any religion (the state was then paying the salaries of
priests) and the attacks upon priests by anticlerical mobs. Robespierre
persuaded the irate Assembly to let the seventy-eight-year-old
philosopher escape arrest, but Raynal’s property was confiscated, and he
died in destitution and disillusionment (1796).</p>
<p>Constantin Chasseboeuf de Volney lived through the Revolution, and
knew every notable in Paris from d’Holbach to Napoleon. After years of
travel in Egypt and Syria he was elected to the States-General, and he
served in the Constituent Assembly till its dissolution in 1791. In that
year he pub- lished the philosophical echoes of his wanderings in Les
Ruines, ou Medita- tions sur les revolutions des empires. What had
caused the collapse of so many ancient civilizations? Volney answered
that they had declined be- cause of the ignorance induced in their
people by supernatural religions al- lied with despotic governments, and
by difficulties in the transmission of knowledge from generation to
generation. Now that mythological creeds were losing their hold, and
printing had facilitated the preservation of knowledge and the
transference of civilization, men might hope to build lasting cultures
upon a moral code in which knowledge, growing and spread- ing, would
extend man’s control over his unsocial tendencies, and promote
cooperation and unity. He was arrested in 1793 as a Girondin, and
remained in prison for nine months. Released, he sailed to America, was
welcomed by George Washington, was denounced as a French spy by
President Adams (1798), and hurried back to France. He served as a
senator under Napoleon, opposed the change from Consulate to Empire, and
retired to a scholarly seclusion until Louis XVIII made him a peer in
1814. He died in 1820, hav- ing shared in deposing and restoring the
Bourbons.</p>

<p>past, philosophers chastised the present, and two women authors
rivaled the men in depth of feeling, political courage, and intellectual
power. One of these, Mme. Roland, we have met in prison and at the
guillotine.</p>
<p>The Didot family, most famous of French publishers, continued to
improve the casting of type and the bindings of books. Francois Didot
had established the firm as printers and booksellers in Paris in 1713;
his sons Francois- Ambroise and Pierre- Frangois carried on experiments
in typography, and issued a collection of French classics on commission
from Louis XVI; Frangois- Ambroise’s son Pierre published editions of
Virgil (1798), Horace (1799), and Racine (1801), so exquisite that the
rich purchasers could enjoy them without reading them; Firmin Didot
(1764-1836), another son of Frangois- Ambroise, earned fame by founding
a new type, and was credited with inventing stereotyping; and the
company of Firmin Didot published in 1884 the magnificent edition of
Paul Lacroix’s Directoire, Consulate et Empire , from</p>
<p>The two most famous poets of the Revolutionary decade began far apart
in decora- tion and style, and ended under the same knife in 1794.
Philippe-Frangois Fabre d’Eglantine composed pretty verses and
successful plays; he became president of the Cordeliers Club, secretary
to Danton, and deputy in the Convention, where he voted for the
expulsion of the Girondins and the beheading of the King. Appointed to
the committee for devising a new calendar, he invented many of the
picturesquely sea- sonal names for its months. On January 12, 1794, he
was arrested on charges of mal- versation, forgery, and dealings with
foreign agents and mercantile profiteers. At his t rial he sang his
charming ballad “// pleut, il pleut, bergere ; rentre tes blancs
moutons”</p>
<p>Andre-Marie de Chenier was a better poet with better morals, but no
better fate. Born at Constantinople (1762) of a French father and a
Greek mother, he divided his literary love between Greek poetry and
French philosophy. He was educated in Navarre, came to Paris in 1784,
made friends with David and Lavoisier, and accepted the Revolution with
reservations. He opposed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which
bound the state with the Catholic Church; he recommended to the National
Assembly the complete separation of Church and state, and full freedom
of worship for every faith; he condemned the September Massacres,
praised Charlotte Corday for killing Marat, and wrote for Louis XVI a
letter to the Convention asking for the right to appeal to the people
from the sentence of death; this service made him suspect to the ruling
Jacobins. Imprisoned as a Girondin, he fell in love with a pretty
prisoner, Mile, de Coigny, and addressed to her “La Jeune Captive,”
which Lamartine pronounced “the most melodious sigh that ever issued
from the apertures of a dungeon.” 58 Brought</p>

<p>Andre’s younger brother, Joseph de Chenier (1764 -1811), was a
successful drama- tist; recall the turmoil caused when Talma played
Charles IX. He wrote the words for the martial “Chant du depart,” and
the “Hymne a la liberte” sung at the Feast of Reason; with a skillful
translation he introduced to France Gray’s Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard. Elected to the Convention, he became in a sense the official
poet of the Revolution. In his later years he was commissioned by the
Institut to compose a Tableau historique de Vetat et du pr ogres de la
litter ature frangaise depuis 1789. He died before completing it; even
so it is an extensive record of writers once famous and now mostly
forgotten even by educated Frenchmen. Immortals die soon after
death.</p>
<p>Commanded and engulfed by politics during the Convention, literature
recovered under the Directory. Hundreds of literary societies were
formed, reading clubs multi - plied, the reading public grew. Most of it
was content with novels; romantic fiction and poetry began to displace
classic tragic drama. Macpherson’s “Ossian,” translate d into French,
became a favorite with a wide variety of readers, from chambermaids to
Napoleon. ,</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>MME. DE STAEL AND THE REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Standing out from the word weavers by force of voice and character
was a woman who, amid successful novels and a succession of lovers,
accepted the Revolution, denounced the mob and the Terror, fought
Napoleon at every step, and survived to victory while he languished in a
living death. Germaine Necker had the advantage of being born to
prominence and for- tune : her father, soon a millionaire, became
France’s minister of finance; her mother, once pursued by Edward Gibbon,
gathered in her salon the cele- brated geniuses or Paris and beyond, to
serve unwittingly or unwillingly in the education of her child.</p>
<p>She was born in Paris on April 22, 1766. Mme. Necker, insisting on
being her chief tutor, filled her with an explosive mixture of history,
literature, philosophy, Racine, Richardson, Calvin, and Rousseau.
Germaine trembled with fashionable sensibility ov er Clarissa Harlowe’s
approach to a fate worse than death, and with youthful enthusiasm over
Rousseau’s call to freedom, but she proved painfully allergic to
Calvinism, and resisted the insistent the- ology and discipline with
which it was daily administered to her. More and more she shied away
from her ailing, dominating mother, and fell in love with her virtuous
but indulgent and providing father. This was the only liaison that she
maintained with lasting fidelity; it made other attachments tangential
and insecure. “Our destinies,” she wrote, “would have united us forever
if fate had made us contemporaries.” 60 Meanwhile, to confuse her
emotions with intellect, she was allowed, from puberty onward, to attend
her mother’s periodical meetings of the minds; there she pleased the
pundits</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 147</p>
<p>by her quickness of understanding and repartee. By the time she was
seven- teen she had become the star of the salon.</p>
<p>Now the problem arose of finding for her a husband who could match
her mind and her prospective fortune. Her parents proposed William Pitt,
the rising light of English politics; Germaine rejected the idea for the
same rea- son that had led her mother to resist Gibbon — there was not
enough sun in England, and the women there were beautiful but unheard.
Baron Eric Magnus Stael von Holstein, being bankrupt, offered his hand;
the Neckers held him at bay until he had become Swedish ambassador to
France. This happened, and Germaine agreed to marry him because she
expected to be more independent as a wife than as a daughter. On January
14, 1786, she became Baronne de Stael-Holstein; she was twenty, the
Baron thirty-seven. We are assured that “she knew nothing of sexual love
until her marriage”; 61 but she was a quick learner in everything. The
Comtesse de Boufflers, who presided at the wedding, described the bride
as “so spoiled by admiration for her wit that it will be hard to make
her realize her shortcomings. She is imperious and strong-willed to
excess, and she has a self-assurance that I have never seen matched by
any person of her age.” 62 She was not beauti - ful, being masculine in
build as well as mind; but her black eyes sparkled with vivacity, and in
conversation she had no equal.</p>
<p>She went to live at the Swedish Embassy in the Rue du Bac, where she
soon established her own salon; but also — since her mother was ailing —
she took char ge of the salon in the apartments over her father’s bank.
Necker had been dismissed from the Ministry of Finance in 1781, but he
was re- called to office in 1788 to help turn aside the threat of
revolution. He was now, despite his millions, the ideal of Paris, and
Germaine, passionately sup- porting him with tongue and pen, had some
reason to be proud. Politics, next to unlicensed love, became her meat
and drink.</p>
<p>On Necker’s advice Louis summoned the States - General; over Necker’s
resistance he bade the three estates sit separately, maintaining class
distinc- tion; On July 12, 1789, he dismissed Necker a second time, and
ordered him to leave France at once. He and Mme. Necker drove to
Brussels; Germaine, wild with wrath, followed them; Stael, forgetting
his official duties, accom- panied her and her fortune. On July 14 the
Parisian populace stormed the Bastille and threatened the monarchy. The
frightened King sent a courier to overtake Necker and call him back to
Paris and office; Necker came; the people acclaimed him. Germaine rushed
to Paris, and thereafter, till the Sep- tember Massacres, felt every day
the hot winds of revolution.</p>
<p>Associating its early stages with her father, and her politics with
her in- come, she supported the States-General, but pleaded for a
bicameral legisla- ture under a constitutional monarchy assuring
representative government, civil liberties, and the protection of
property. As the Revolution proceeded she used all her influence to
moderate the Jacobins and encourage the Girondins.</p>
<p>However, she outdistanced the Jacobins in her moral philosophy.
Nearly all the men she met thought it reasonable that their marriages,
having been</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>unions of property and not of hearts, should allow for a mistress or
two to give them excitement and romance; but they held that similar
privileges could not be extended to the wife, since her infidelity would
cause disruptive uncertainties in the inheritance of property. Germaine
did not feel this argument, since in her case — an only child — the
property in question and in prospect was almost wholly her own. She
concluded that she should feel free to seek romance, even to sampling
other beds.</p>
<p>She had soon lost respect for her husband, who was too obedient to be
interesting, and too incompetent to be solvent. She did not object to
his taking Mile. Clairon as a mistress, but he was spending his official
income on the seventy-year-old actress, was neglecting his duties as
ambassador, was gambling and losing, and repeatedly accumulating debts
which his wife and father-in-law reluctantly paid. So she made her way
through a procession of lovers, for, as she was to say in Delphine,
“Between God a nd love I recog- nize no mediator but my conscience”; and
conscience could be managed. One of her first collaborators was
Talleyrand, ex-bishop of Autun, who agreed with her on the flexibility
of vows. After him came Comte Jacques- Antoine de Guibert, lately the
beau ideal of Julie de Lespinasse; however, he died in 1790, aged
forty-seven. A year earlier Germaine had formed a deeper and more
lasting attachment with Louis de Narbonne-Lara. He was the son of an
illegal union, and was himself, at thirty-three, the father of several
bas- tards; but he was remarkably handsome, and had that ease and grace
of manner which unpedigreed youth can seldom learn. By social heredity
he was all for the aristocracy against an “upstart” bourgeoisie, but
Germaine persuaded him to her ideas of a constitutional monarchy in
which the prop- ertied class would share in power with the nobility and
the king. If we may believe her, Narbonne “changed his destiny for my
sake. He broke his at - tachments and consecrated his life to me. In a
word, he convinced me that… he would consider himself happy to possess
my heart, but that if he lost it irremediably he could not survive.”
63</p>
<p>On September 4, 1790, Necker, his liberal policy frustrated by the
nobles around the King, resigned, and retired with his wife to a
temporarily quiet life in his chateau at Coppet. Germaine joined them in
October, but she soon tired of Swiss peace, and hurried back to what she
called, by comparison, the delectable “gutter of the Rue du Bac.” 64
There her salon hummed with the voices of Lafayette, Condorcet, Brissot,
Barnave, Talleyrand, Narbonne, and her own. She was not content to set
the pace for brilliant conversation; she longed to play a part in
politics. She indulged the dream of leading France from Catholicism to
Protestantism, but she hoped, through her nest of notables, to bring the
Revolution to a peaceful rest in constitutional mon- archy. With help
from Lafayette and Barnave, she secured the appointment of Narbonne as
minister of war (December 6, 1791). Marie Antoinette re- luctantly
supported the appointment. “What glory for Mme. de Stael,” she
commented; “what joy for her to have the whole army at her disposal!” 65
Narbonne went too fast. On February 24, 1 792, he presented to Louis XVI
a memorandum advising the King to break with the aristocracy and give
his</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 149</p>
<p>rust and support to a propertied bourgeoisie pledged to maintain law
and order and a limited monarchy. The other ministers angrily protested;
Louis yielded to them, and dismissed Narbonne. Germaine’s house of cards
fell; and to put salt in her wounds her rival, Mme. Roland, secured,
through Brissot, the appointment of her husband as minister of the
interior.</p>
<p>Germaine lived in Paris through most of the terrible year 1792. On
June 20, 1792, she witnessed (if only across the Seine) the storming of
the Tuileries by a crowd whose unvarnished manners frightened her.
“Their frightful oaths and shouts, their threatening gestures, their
murderous weap- ons, offered a horrifying spectacle which could forever
destroy the respect which the human race should inspire.” 66 But that
journee (as the French came to call an uprising of the populace) was an
amiable rehearsal, crowned and appeased by the red cap of the Revolution
on the King’s head. On Au - gust 10, however, she witnessed, from her
coign of safety, the bloody cap- ture of the Tuileries by a mob that did
not rest until the King and the Queen fled to a momentary protection by
the Legislative Assembly. The triumphant rebels began to arrest every
available aristocrat; Germaine spent her fortune liberally in protecting
her titled friends. She hid Narbonne in the recesses of the Swedish
Embassy; she stoutly resisted, and finally deflected, a search patrol;
and by August 20 Narbonne was safe in England.</p>
<p>Still worse came on September 2, when the fear-maddened sansculottes
led the arrested nobles and their supporters out of their jails and
murdered them as they emerged. Mme. de Stael barely escaped that fate.
After helping many of her friends to get out of Paris and France, she
herself set forth, on that bright September 2, in a stately carriage
with six horses and liveried ser- vants, toward the city gates; she
deliberately put on the style and insignia of the ambassadress in the
hope of receiving diplomatic courtesies. Almost at the start the
carriage was stopped by “a swarm of old women, i ssued from hell.” Burly
workingmen ordered the postilions to drive to the headquarters -
quarters of the Commune she found a friend who secured her release; he
escorted her to the embassy, and gave her a passport that enabled her,
the next morning, to pass safely out of Paris on the long ride to
Coppet. That was the day on which the head of the Princesse de Lamballe,
parading on a pike, passed below the imprisoned Queen.</p>
<p>Germaine reached the arms of her parents on September 7. In October,
hearing of revolution in Geneva, they moved eastward to Rolle, nearer to
Lausanne. On November 20, 1792, the twenty-six-year-old mother gave
birth to a son, Albert, whom she had been carrying with her through her
adventures with death. Probably he had been sired by Narbonne, but her
husband was led to believe, or pretend, that he was the father. At
Rolle, and</p>
<p>I 5°</p>

<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>hen at Coppet, she gave passing refuge to a number of men and women,
titled or not, who were in flight before the coming Terror. “Neither she
nor her father cared for opinion in the presence of misfortune.”? 8</p>
<p>When she heard that Narbonne had offered to leave his refuge in Eng-
land to come and testify in defense of Louis XVI, Germaine could not
bear the thought that he would so endanger himself; she must go to
England and dissuade him. She made her way through France and across the
Channel, and joined Narbonne in Juniper Hall, at Mickelham near London,
on January 21, 1793 — the day that Louis was guillotined. Her former
lover was too de- pressed by the news to give her much welcome; his
aristocratic lineage re- asserted itself, and his love for his mistress
lost its ardor in his grief for the King. Talleyrand came from nearby
London for frequent visits, and cheered them with his humor. Fanny
Burney joined them, and reported (in Ma- caulay’s summary) “that she had
never heard such conversation before. The most animated eloquence, the
keenest observation, the most sparkling wit, the most courtly grace,
were united to charm her.” She refused to believe the gossip that
Narbonne and Germaine were living in adultery. She wrote to her father,
the famous historian of music:</p>
<p>This intimation was… wholly new to me, and I do firmly believe it a
gross calumny. She loves him even tenderly, but so openly, so simply, so
un- affectedly, and with such utter freedom from all coquetry…. She is
very plain, he is very handsome; her intellectual endowments must be
with him her sole attraction…. I think you could not spend a day with
them and not see that their commerce is that of a pure but exalted…
friendship. 69</p>
<p>When Fanny became assured that this brilliant couple were living in
shame- less sin, she sorrowfully gave up her visits to Juniper Hall.</p>
<p>The little group was shunned, too, by earlier emigres , who accused
them of having too long defended the Revolution. On May 25, 1793,
Germaine crossed to Ostend; then, as still the wife of the Swedish
ambassador, she made her way safely to Bern, where she was met by her
occasional husband, and went with him to Coppet. Thence she issued
Reflections on the Trial of the Queen, by a Woman, a fervent appeal for
mercy toward Marie An- toinette. But the Queen was guillotined on
October 16, 1793.</p>
<p>Mme. Necker died on May 15, 1794. Her husband mourned her with a
depth of affection that only long unity can bring. Germaine, not over-
whelmed, moved to the Chateau of Mezerey, near Lausanne, to form a new
salon, and to forget everything else in the arms of Count Ribbing.
Narbonne, arriving tardily, found himself displaced, and returned to a
former mistress. Sometime in the fall of 1794 a tall, freckle-faced,
red-haired Swiss, Benjamin Constant, almost twenty-seven, met Germaine
at Nyon, and began with her a long embattled union of literature and
love.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Robespierre had fallen; the moderates came to power; now
she might return to Paris. She did in May, 1795, made peace with her
hus- band, and revived her salon at the Swedish Embassy. There she
brought to- gether the new leaders of the dying Convention — Barras,
Tallien, Boissy d’Anglas, and literary lions like Marie -Joseph de
Chenier. She plunged so</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 1 5 1</p>
<p>avidly into politics that a deputy denounced her on the floor of the
Con- vention as conducting a monarchist conspiracy while cuckolding her
hus- band. The new Committee of Public Safety ordered her to leave
France; by January i, 1796, she was back in Coppet. There, between
Constant and her books, she wrote a somber study, De I’influence des
passions , dripping with Rousseau and feeling, echoing The Sorrows of
Wert her, and praising sui- cide. Her friends in Paris arranged ecstatic
reviews. The Directory notified her that she might come to France, but
not closer than twenty miles to the capital. She and Constant settled in
a former abbey at Herivaux. In the spring of 1797 she was allowed to
join her husband in Paris. There, on June 8, she gave birth to a
daughter, Albertine, of uncertain paternity. Amid these complications
she secured, through Barras, the recall of Talleyrand from exile, and
his appointment (July 18, 1797) as minister of foreign affairs. In 1798
Baron de Stael lost his post as ambassador. He gave Germaine an amicable
separation in return for an allowance, and retired to an apartment in
what is now the Place de la Concorde, where we shall find him dying

<p>On December 6, 1796, at a reception given by Talleyrand to the home-
coming conqueror of Italy, she first met Napoleon. He spoke to her some
words in praise of her father. For the first time in her life she was

<p>Having told the story of the French Revolution as impartially as old
age allowed, it remains to face, within the same limitations, the
questions that philosophy would ask: Was the Revolution justified by its
causes or results? Did it leave any significant gains for the French
people or humanity? Could its gains have been achieved without their
cost in chaos and suffering? Does its record suggest any conclusions
about revolutions in general? Does it shed any light upon the nature of
man? We speak here only of political revo- lutions — rapid and violent
changes of government in personnel and policy. A development without
violence we should call an evolution; a quick and</p>
<p>152 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>violent or illegal change of personnel without a change in the form
of gov- ernment would be a coup d’etat; any open resistance to an
existing authority is a rebellion.</p>
<p>The causes of the French Revolution were, in summary: (1) the
rebellion of the parlements, weakening the authority of the King and the
loyalty of the nobility of the robe; (2) the ambition of Philippe
d’Orleans to replace</p>
<p>The results of the French Revolution were so many, so complex,
various, and lasting, that one would have to write a history of the
nineteenth cen- tury to do them justice.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The political results were obvious: the replacement of feudalism by
a free and partially propertied peasantry; of feudal by civil courts; of
absolute monarchy by a property-limited democracy; of a titled
aristocracy by a business bourgeoisie as the dominant and administrative
class. Along with democracy came — at least in phrase and hope —
equality before the law and in opportunity, and freedom of speech,
worship, and press. These liberties were soon lessened by the natural
inequality of men in ability, and their environmental inequality in
homes, schools, and wealth. Almost as remark- able as these political,
economic, and legal emancipations was their extension to north Italy,
the Rhineland, Belgium, and Holland by the armies of the Revolution; in
those regions too the feudal system was swept away, and it did not
return when Napoleon fell. In this sense the conquerors were liber-
ators, who tarnished their gifts with the exactions of their rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Revolution completed that unification of semi-independent
provinces — with their feudal baronies and tolls, their diverse origins,
traditions, moneys, and laws — into a centrally governed France with a
national army and a national law. This change, as Tocqueville pointed
out, had been going on under the Bourbons; it would probably have been
achieved, without the Revolution, by the unifying influence of a
nationwide commerce which in- creasingly ignored provincial boundaries —
very much as a national economy</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>*53</p>
<p>in the United States compelled the erosion of “states’ rights” by a
federal government compelled to be strong.</p>
<p>In like manner the emancipation of the peasantry, and the rise of the
bourgeoisie to economic ascendancy and political power, would probably
have come without the Revolution, though more slowly. The Revolution
under the National Assembly (1789-91) was amply justified by its lasting
results, but the Revolution under the governments of 1792-95 was a
barbaric interlude of murder, terror, and moral collapse, inadequately
excused by for- eign conspiracies and attacks. When, in 1830, another
revolution ended in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, the
result was approximately what had been achieved in 1791.</p>
<p>The gain made by the Revolution in unifying France as a nation was
offset by the growth of nationalism as a new source of group animosity.
The eighteenth century had tended, in the educated classes, to a
cosmopolitan weakening of national differences in culture, dress, and
language; armies themselves were largely international in their leaders
and men. The Revolu- tion replaced these polyglot warriors with national
conscripts, and the nation replaced the dynasty as the object of loyalty
and the font of war. A military brotherhood of generals succeeded to an
aristocratic caste of officers; the power of patriotic troops overcame
the spiritless employees of old regimes. When the French Army developed
its own discipline and pride it became the only source of order in a
chaotic state, the sole refuge from a babel of governmental incompetence
and popular insurgency.</p>
<p>The Revolution unquestionably promoted liberty in France and beyond;
for a while it extended the new freedom to the French colonies, and
emanci- pated their slaves. But individual freedom contains its own
nemesis; it tends to increase until it overruns the restraints necessary
for social order and group survival; freedom unlimited is chaos
complete. Moreover, the kind of ability needed for a revolution is quite
different from the kind required for building a new order: the one task
is furthered by resentment, passion, cour- age, and disregard for law;
the other calls for patience, reason, practical judgment, and respect
for law. Since new laws are not buttressed by tradi- tion and habit,
they usually depend upon force as their sanction and sup- port; the
apostles of freedom become, or yield to, wielders of power; and these
are no longer the leaders of destructive mobs but the commanders of
disciplined builders protected and supervised by a martial state.
Fortunate is the revolution that can evade or shorten dictatorship and
preserve its gains of liberty for posterity.</p>

<li>The economic results of the Revolution were peasant proprietorship
and capitalism, each begetting endless effects of its own. Wedded to
prop- erty, the peasants became a powerful conservative force,
nullifying the socialistic drive of the propertyless proletariat, and
serving as an anchor of underlying stability in a state — and through a
century — turbulent with after- shocks of the Revolution. So protected
in the countryside, capitalism devel-</li>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>oped in the towns; mobile money replaced landed wealth as an economic
and political power; free enterprise escaped from governmental control.
The Physiocrats won their batde for the determination of prices, wages,
prod- ucts, successes, and failures by competition in the “market”— the
play of eco- nomic forces unimpeded by law. Goods moved from province to
province without being harassed or delayed by internal tolls. Industrial
wealth grew, and was increasingly concentrated at the top.</p>
<p>Revolution — or legislation — repeatedly redistributes concentrated
wealth, and the inequality of ability or privilege concentrates it
again. The diverse capabilities of individuals demand and necessitate
unequal rewards. Every natural superiority begets advantages of
environment or opportunity. The Revolution tried to reduce these
artificial inequalities, but they were soon renewed, and soonest under
regimes of liberty. Liberty and equality are enemies: the more freedom
men enjoy, the freer they are to reap the results of their natural or
environmental superiorities; hence inequality multiplies under
governments favoring freedom of enterprise and support of property
rights. Equality is an unstable equilibrium, which any difference in
heredity, health, intelligence, or character will soon end. Most
revolutions find that they can check inequality only by limiting
liberty, as in authoritarian lands. In democratic France inequality was
free to grow. As for fraternity, it was knifed by the guillotine, and
became, in time, an agreement to wear panta- loons.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The cultural results of the Revolution are still influencing our
lives. It proclaimed freedom of speech, press, and assembly; it severely
reduced this, and Napoleon ended it, under stress of war, but the
principle survived and fought repeated battles through the nineteenth
century, to become an ac- cepted practice or pretense in
twentieth-century democracies. The Revolu- tion planned and began a
national system of schools. It encouraged science as a world-view
alternative to theology. In 1791 the Revolutionary govern- ment
appointed a commission, headed by Lagrange, to devise, for a newly
unified France, a new system of weights and measures; the resultant
metric system was officially adopted in 1792, and was made law in 1799;
it had to fight its way through the provinces, and its victory was not
complete till 1840; it is painfully displacing the duodecimal system in
Great Britain today.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Revolution began the separation of Church and state, but this
proved difficult in a France overwhelmingly Catholic and traditionally
dependent upon the Church for the moral instruction of its people. The
separation was not completed till 1905, and today it is weakening again
under the pres- sure of a life-sustaining myth. Having attempted the
divorce, the Revo- lution struggled to spread a natural ethic; we have
seen that this failed. In one aspect the history of France in the
nineteenth century was a long and pe- riodically convulsive attempt to
recover from the ethical collapse of the Revolution. The twentieth
century approaches its end without having yet found a natural substitute
for religion in persuading the human animal to morality.</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) LIFE UNDER THE REVOLUTION I55</p>
<p>The Revolution left some lessons for political philosophy. It led a
widen- ing minority to realize that the nature of man is the same in all
classes; that revolutionists, raised to power, behave like their
predecessors, and in some cases more ruthlessly; compare Robespierre
with Louis XVI. Feeling in themselves the strong roots of savagery
perpetually pressing against the con- trols of civilization, men became
skeptical of revolutionary claims, ceased to expect incorruptible
policemen and saintly senators, and learned that a revo- lution can
achieve only so much as evolution has prepared and us human nature will
permit.</p>
<p>Despite its shortcomings — and perhaps because of its excesses — the
Revolu- tion left a powerful impression upon the memory, emotions,
aspirations, lit- erature, and art of France, and of other nations from
Russia to Brazil. Even to 1848 old men would be telling children of the
heroes and terrors of that exciting time, that reckless, merciless
questioning of all traditional values. Was it any wonder that
imaginations and passions were stirred as seldom before, and that
recurring visions of happier states spurred men and women to repeated
attempts to realize the noble dreams of that historic decade? Tales of
its brutalities led souls to pessimism and loss of every faith; there
were to be Schopenhauers and Leopardis, Byrons and Mussets, a Schubert
and a Keats, in the next generation. But there would be hopeful and in-
vigorating spirits too — Hugo, Balzac, Gautier, Delacroix, Berlioz,
Blake, Shelley, Schiller, Beethoven — who would share intensely in the
Romantic uprising of feeling, imagination, and desire against caution,
tradition, prohi- bition, and restraint. For twenty-six years France
would wonder and waver under the spell of the Revolution and Napoleon —
the greatest romance and greatest romantic of all; and half the world
would be frightened or inspired by that event-full quarter century in
which an exalted and suffering nation touched such heights and depths as
history had rarely known before, and has never known since.</p>
