<p>I. THEACHAEANS</p>
<p>M odest Hittke tablets from Boghaz Keui, of approximately 1325</p>
<p>B.C., speak of the “Ahhijava” as a people equal in pow^r to the</p>
<p>Hittites themselves. An Egyptian record toward 1221 b.c. mentions the
“Akaiwasha” as joining other “Peoples of the Sea” in a Libyan invasion
of Egypt, and describes them as a roving band “fighting to fill their
bellies.’” In Homer the Achaeans are, specifically, a Greek-speaking
people of south- ern Thessaly;® often, however, because they had become
the most powerful of the Greek tribes, Homer uses their name for all the
Greeks at Troy. Greek historians and poets of the classic age called the
Achaeans, like the Pelasgians, autochthonous — native to Greece as far
back as memory could recall; and they assumed without hesitation that
the Achaean culture de- scribed in Homer was one with that which has
here been termed Myce- naean. Schliemann accepted this identification,
and for a brief while the world of scholarship agreed with him.</p>
<p>In 1901 an unusually iconoclastic Englishman, Sk William Ridgeway,*
upset this happy confidence by pointing out that though Achaean
civiliza- tion agreed with the Mycenaean in many ways, it differed in
vital particu- lars. ( I ) Iron is practically unknown to the
Mycenaeans; the Achaeans are familiar with it. (2) The dead in Homer are
cremated; in Tiryns and</p>
<p>Mycenae they are buried, implying a different conception of the
afterlife. (3) The Achaean gods are the Olympians, of whom no trace has
been found in the culture of Mycenae. (4) The Achaeans use long swords,
round shields, and safety-pin brooches; no objects of such form appear
in the varied Mycenaean remains. (5) There are considerable
dissimilarities in coiffure and dress. Ridgeway concluded that the
Mycenaeans were Pelas- gians, and spoke Greek; that the Achaeans were
blond “Celts,” or Central</p>

<p>(CHAP.m</p>
<p>hemselves as feudal chieftains ruling from their fortress-palaces a
sub- jugated Pelasgian population.</p>
<p>The theory is illuminating, even if it must be substantially
modified.</p>
<p>Greek literature says nothing of an Achaean invasion; and it would
not be wise to hang a rejection of so unanimous a tradition upon a
gradual in- crease in the use of iron, a change in modes of burial or
coiffure, a lengthen- ing of swords or rounding of shields, or even a
safety pin. It is more likely that the Achaeans, as all classic writers
supposed, were a Greek tribe that, in its natural multiplication,
expanded from Thessaly into the Peloponnesus durii^ the fourteenth and
thirteenth centuries, mingled their blood with the Pelasgo-Mycenaeans
there, and, towards 1250 b.c., became the ruling class.^ Probably it was
they who gave Greek to the Pelasgians, instead of receiving it from
them. In such place names as Corinth and Tiryns, Parnas- sus and
Olympia,* we may have echoes of a Creto-Pelasgo-Mycenaean tongue.* In
the same manner, presumably, the Achaeans superimposed their mountain
and sky gods upon the “chthonic” or subterranean deities of the earlier
population. For the rest there is no sharp line of separation between
the Mycenaean culture and that later phase of it, the Achaean, which we
find in Homer; the two ways of life seem to have mingled and melted into
one. Slowly, as the amalgamation proceeded, Aegean civilization passed
away, dying in the defeat of Troy, and Greek civilization began.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE HEROIC LEGENDS</li>
</ol>
<p>The legends of the Heroic Age suggest both the origins and the
destinies of the Achaeans. We must not ignore these stories; for though
a sanguinary fancy enlivens them, they may contain more history than we
suppose; and they are so bound up with Greek poetry, drama, and art that
we should be at a loss to understand these without them.f</p>

common in modem times to regard these and the other heroes of this age…
as purely m}rthical creations. The later Greeks, in criticizing the
records of their past, had no doubt that they were historical per- sons

extreme skepti- cism many modem critics have begun to revert to the
Greek view as that which explains the evidence most satisfactorily. • •.

<p>THE HEROIC AGE</p>
<p>CHAP, hi)</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Hittite inscriptions mention an Atarissyas as King of the Ahhijavas
in the thirteenth century b.c.; he is probably Atreus, King of the
Achaeans.* In Greek story Zeus begat Tantalus, King of Phrygia,* who
begat Pelops, who begat Atreus, who begat Agamemnon. Pelops, being
exiled, came to Elis in the western Peloponnesus about 1283, and
determined to marry Hip- podameia, daughter of Oeno maus, Elis’ king.
The east pediment of the great temple of Zeus at Olympia still tells us
the story of their courtship. The King made a practice to test his
daughter’s suitors by competing with</p>
<p>ominous curse upon Pelops and all his descendants.</p>
<p>Pelops’ daughter married Sthenelus, son of Perseus and King of Argos;
the throne passed down to their son Eurystheus, and, after the latter’s
death, to his uncle Atreus. Atreus’ sons Agame mnon and Menelaus married
Clytaemnestra and Helen, daughters of King Tyndareus of Lacedaemon; and
when Atreus and Tyndareus died, Agamemnon and Menelaus between them
ruled all the eastern Peloponnesus from their respective capitals at
Mycenae and Sparta. The Peloponnesus, or Island of Pelops, came to be
called after their grandfather, whose descendants had quite forgotten
the curse of Myrtilus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the remainder of Greece was also busy with heroes, usually
founding cities. In the fifteenth century before our era, said Greek
tradi- tion, the iniquity of the human race provoked 2^us to overwhelm
it with a flood, from which one man, Deucalion, and his wife Pyrrha,
alone were saved, in an ark or chest that came to rest on Mt. Parnassus.
From Deuca- lion’s son Hellen had come all the Greek tribes, and their
united name, Hellenes. Hellen was grandfather of Achaeus and Ion, who
begot the</p>
<p>• Tantalus angered the gods by divulging their secrets, stealing
their nectar and ambrosia, and offering them his son Pelops, boiled and
sliced. Zeus put Pelops together again, and punished Tantalus, in Hades,
with a raging thirst; Tantalus was placed in the midst of a lake whose
waters receded whenever he tried to drink of them; over his head
branches rich in fruit were hung, which withdrew when he sought to reach
them; a great rock was suspended above him, which at every moment
threatened to fall and crush him/</p>
<p>40 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.HI</p>
<p>Achaean and Ionian tribes, which, after many wanderings, peopled re-
spectively the Peloponnesus and Attica. One of Ion’s descendants,
^crops, with the help of the goddess Athena, founded (on a site whose
acropolis had already been settled by Pelasgians) the city that was
named after her, Athens.* It was he, said the story, that gave
civilization to Attica, instituted marriage, abolished bloody
sacrifices, and taught his subjects to worship the Olympian gods — Zeus
and Athena above the rest.</p>
<p>The descendants of Cecrops ruled Athens as kings. The fourth in line
was Erechtheus, to whom the city, honoring him as a god, would later
dedicate one of its loveliest temples. His grandson, Theseus, about
1250, merged the twelve demes or villages of Attica into one political
unity, whose citizens, wherever they lived, were to be called Athenians;
perhaps it was because of this historic synoikismos, or municipal
cohabitation, that Athens, like Thebes and Mycenae, had a plural name.
It was Theseus who brought order and power to Athens, ended the
sacrifice of her children to Minos, and gave her people security on the
roads by slaying the highwayman Procrustes, who had liked to stretch or
cut the legs of his captives to make them fit his bed. After Theseus’
death Athens worshiped him, too, as a god. As late as 476, in the
skeptical age of Pericles, the city brought the bones of Theseus from
Scyros and deposited them as sacred relics in the temple of Theseus.</p>
<p>To the north, in Boeotia, a rival capital had equally stirring
traditions, destined to become the very substance of Greek drama in the
classic age. Late in the fourteenth century b.c. the Phoenician or
Cretan or Egyptian prince Cadmus founded the city of Thebes at the
meeting of the roa^ that cross Greece from east to west and from north
to south, taught its people letters, and slew the dragon (perhaps an
ancient phrase for an infecting or infesting organism) that hindered the
settlers from using the waters of the Areian spring. From the dragon’s
teeth, which Cadmus sowed in the earth, sprang armed men who, like the
Greeks of history, attacked one another until only five survived; these
five, said Thebes, were the founders of her royal families. The
government established itself on a hill citadel called the Cadmeia,
where in our own time a “palace of Cadmus” has been unearthed.* There,
after Cadmus, reigned his son Polydorus, his grand- son Labdacus, and
his great-grandson Laius, whose son Oedipus, as all the world knows,
slew his father and married his mother. When Oedipus died</p>

<p>his sons quarreled over the scepter, as is the habit of princes.
Eteocks drove out Polynices, ’who persuaded Adrastus, King of Argos, to
attempt his restoration. Adrastus tried (ca. 1213), in the famous war of
the Seven (Allies) against Thebes, and again sixteen years later in the
war of the Epigoni, or sons of the Seven. This time both Eteocles and
Polynices were killed, and Thebes was burned to the ground.</p>
<p>Among the Theban aristocrats was one Amphitryon, who had a charm- ing
■ wife, Alcmene. Her Zeus visited while Amphitryon was gone to the wars;
and Heracles (Hercules) was their son.* Hera, who did not relish these
jovial condescensions, sent two serpents to destroy the babe in the
cradle; but the boy grasped one in each hand and strangled them both;
therefore he was called Heracles, as having won glory through Hera.
Linus, oldest name in the history of music, tried to teach the youth how
to play and sing; but Heracles did not care for music, and slew Linus
with the lyre. When he grew up — a clumsy, bibulous, gluttonous, kindly
giant — he undertook to kill a lion that was ravaging the flocks of
Amphitryon and Thespius. The latter. King of Thespiae, offered his home
and his fifty daughters to Heracles, who rose to the occasion manfully.“
He slew the lion, and wore its skin as his garb. He married Megara,
daughter of Creon of Thebes, and tried to settle do-wn; but Hera sent a
madness upon him, and imwittingly he killed his o’wn children. He
consulted the oracle at Delphi, and was instructed to go and live at
Tiryns and serve Eurystheus, the Argive king, for twelve years; after
which he would become an immortal god. He obeyed, and carried out for
Eurystheus his famous twelve labors.! Released by the king, Heracles
returned to Thebes. He performed many</p>

<p>He strangled the lion that troubled the flocks at Nemea; he destroyed
the many-headed hydra that ravaged Lema; he captured a fleet stag and
carried it to Eurystheus; he caught a ^d boar from Mt. Eurymanthus and
carried it to Eurystheus; in one day he cleansed aU the stables of
Augeas’ three thousand oxen by diverting the rivers Alpheus and Peneus

<p>Other exploits; he joined the Argonauts, sacked Troy, helped the gods
to win their battle against the giants, freed Prometheus, brought
Alcestis back to life, and, now and then, killed his own friends by
accident. After his death he was worshiped as hero and god; and since he
had had countless loves, many tribes claimed him as their
progenitor.*</p>
<p>His sons made their home at Trachis in Thessaly; but Eurystheus,
fear- ing lest they depose him in revenge for the unnecessary labors
that he had laid upon their father, ordered the Trachinian king to exile
them from Greece. The Heracleidae (i.e., children of Heracles) found
refuge in</p>
<p>Athens; Eurystheus sent an army to attack them, but they defeated and
killed him. When Atreus came against them with another force, Hyllus,
one of the sons, oflFered to fight any of Atreus’ men in single combat,
o n condition that if he won, the Heracleidae should receive the kingdom
of Mycenae; if he lost, the Heracleidae would depart and not return for
fifty years, after which time their children were to receive Mycenae.“
He lost, and led his partisans into exile. Fifty years later a new
generation of Hera- cleidae returned; it was they, not the Dorians, said
Greek tradition, who, being resisted in their claims, conquered the
Peloponnesus, and put an end to the Heroic Age.</p>
<p>If the tale of Pelops and his descendants suggests the Asia Minor
origin of the Achaeans, the theme of their destiny is struck in the
story of the Argonauts. Like so many of the legends that served as both
the historical tradition and the popular fiction of the Greeks, it is an
excellent narrative, with all the elements of adventure, exploration,
war, love, mystery, and death woven into a fabric so rich that after the
dramatists of Athens had almost worn it bare it was rewoven into a very
passable epic, in Hellenistic days, by Apollonius of Rhodes. It begins
in Boeotian Orchomenos on the harsh note of human sacrifice, like
Agamemnon’s tragedy. Finding his land stricken with famine. King Athamas
proposed to offer his son Phrixus to the gods. Phrixus learned of the
plan and escaped from Orchomenos with his sister Helle, riding with her
through the air on a ram with a golden fleece. But the ram was unsteady,
and Helle feU off and was drowned in the strait which after her was
called the Hellespont. Phrixus reached land • This amazing “culture
hero,” Diodorus thought, was a primitive engineer, a prehistoric
Empedocles; the legends told about him meant that he had cleansed the
springs, cleaved mountains, changed the courses of rivers, reclaimed
waste areas, rid the woods of dangerous beasts, and made Greece a
habitable land.^ In another aspect Heracles is the beloved son of ^od
who suffers for mankind, raises the dead to life, descends into Hades,
and then ascends into heaven.</p>
<p>CHAP.m) THE HEROIC AGE 43</p>
<p>and found his way to Qdchis, at the farther end of the Black Sea;
there he sacrificed the ram and hung up its fleece as an offering to
Ares, god of war. Aietes, King of Colchis, set a sleepless dragon to
watch the fleece, for an oracle had said that he should die if a
stranger carried it off; and to better assure himself he decreed that
all strangers coming to Colchis should be put to death. His daughter
Medea, who loved strange men and ways, pitied the wayfarers who entered
Colchis, and helped them to escape. Her father ordered her to be
confined; but she fled to a sacred precinct near the sea, and lived
there in bitter brooding till Jason found her wandering on the
shore.</p>
<p>Some twenty years before (Greek chronologists said about 1245),</p>
<p>Pelias, son of Poseidon, had usurped the throne of Aeson, King of
lolcus in Thessaly. Aeson’s infant son Jason had been hidden by friends,
and had grown up in the woods to great strength and courage. One day he
ap- peared in the market place, dressed in a leopard skin and armed with
two spears, and demanded his kingdom. But he was simple as well as
strong, and Pelias persuaded him to undertake a heavy task as the price
of the throne — to recover the Golden Fleece. So Jason built the great
ship Argo (the Swift), and called to the adventure the bravest spirits
in Greece. Heracles came, with his beloved companion Hylas; and Peleus,
father of Achilles; Theseus, Meleager, Orpheus, and the fleet-footed
maiden Atal- anta. As the vessel entered the Hellespont it was halted,
seemingly by some force from Troy, for Heracles left the expedition to
sack the city and kill its King Laomedon, and all his sons but
Priam.</p>
<p>When, after many tribulations, the Argonauts reached their goal, they
were warned by Medea of the death that awaited all strangers in Colchis.
But Jason persisted; and Medea agreed to help him gain the Fleece if he
would take her to Thessaly and keep her as his wife until he died. He
pledged himself to her, captured the Fleece with her aid, and fled back
to his ship with her and his men. Many of them were wounded, but Medea
quickly healed them with roots and herbs. When Jason reached lolcus he
again asked for the kingdom, and Pelias again delayed. Then Medea, by
the arts of a sorceress, deceived the daughters of Pelias into boiling
him to death. Frightened by her magic powers, the people drove her and
Jason from lolcus, and debarred him forever from the throne.” The rest
belongs to Euripides.</p>

<p>ies of love; legend is often a fragment of history swelling with new
fictions as it rolls down the years. It is probable that in the
generation before the historic siege of Troy the Greefe had tried to
force their way through the Hellespont and open the Black Sea to
colonization and trade; the story of the Argonauts may be the dramatized
memory of that commercial eiqilora- tion; a nd the “golden fleece” may
refer to the woolen skins or cloths an - ciently used in northern Asia
Minor to catch particles of gold carried down by the streams.** A Greek
settlement was actually made, about this time, on the island of Lemnbs,
not far from the Hellespont. The Black Sea proved inhospitable despite
its propitiating name, and the fortress of Troy rose again after
Heracles’ visitation to discourage adventures in the strait. But the
Greeks did not forget; they would come again, a thousand ships in- stead
of one; and on the plain of llion the Achaeans would destroy them-
selves to free the Hellespont.</p>

<li>HOMERIC CIVILIZATION</li>
</ol>
<p>How shall we reconstruct the hfe of Achaean Greece (i 300-1 loo b.c.)
out of the poetry of its legends? Our chief reliance must be upon Homer,
who may never have existed, and whose epics are younger by at least
three centuries than the Achaean Age. It is true that archeology has
surprised the archeologists by making reahties of Troy, Mycenae, Tiryns,
Cnossus, and other cities described in the Iliad, and by exhuming a
Mycenaean civilization strangely akin to that which spontaneously takes
form between the lines of Homer; so that our inclination today is to
accept as real the central characters of his fascinating tales. None the
less, it is impossible to say how far the poems reflect the age in which
the poet lived, rather than the age of which he writes. We shall merely
ask, then, what did Greek tradition, as gathered together in Homer,
conceive the Homeric Age to be? In any case we shall have a picture of
Hellas in buoyant transit from the Aegean culture to the civilization of
historic Greece.</p>

<p>The Achaeans (i.e., the Greeks of the Heroic Age) impress us as less

<p>culture as effeminate degeneration; they use writing under protest,
and the only literature they know is the martial lay and unwritten song
of the trouba- dour. If we believe Homer we must suppose that Zeus had
realized in Achaean society the aspiration of the American poet who
wrote that if he were God he would make all men strong, and all women
beautiful, and would then himself become a man. Homeric Greece is
kalligymikct^ — it is a dream of fair women. The men too are handsome,
with their long hair and their brave beards; the greatest gift that a
man can give is to cut off his hair and lay it as an offering upon the
funeral pyre of his friend.“ Nakedness is not yet cultivated; both sexes
cover the body with a quadrangular garment folded over the shoulders,
tied with a clasp pin, and reaching nearly to the knees; the women may
add a veil or a girdle, and the men a loincloth — which, as dignity
increases, will evolve into drawers and trousers. The well to do go in
for costly robes, such as that which Priam brings humbly to Achilles in
ransom for his son.” The men are</p>
<p>How do these men and women live? Homer shows them to us tilling the
soil, sniffing with pleasure the freshly turned dark earth, running
their eyes with pride along the furrows they have ploughed so straight,
winnowing the wheat, irrigating the fields, and banking up the streams
against the winter floods;” he makes us feel the despair of the peasant
whose months of toil are washed out by “the torrent at the full that in
swift co urse shatters the dykes, neither can the long line of mounds
hold it in, nor the walls of the fruitful orchards stay its sudden
coming.”” The land is hard to farm, for much of it is mountain, or
swamp, or deeply wooded hill; the villages are visited by wild beasts,
and hunt- ing is a necessity before it becomes a sport. The rich are
great stockbreeders, raising cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and horses; one
Erichthonius keeps three thou- sand brood mares with their foals.^ The
poor eat fish and grain, occasionally vegetables; warriors and the rich
rely upon great portions of roast meat; they breakfast on meat and wine.
Odysseus and his swineherd eat, between them, a small roast pig for
luncheon, and a third of a five-year- old hog for dinner.” They have
honey instead of sugar, meat fat instead of butter; instead of bread
they eat cakes of grain, baked large and thin on a plate of iron or a
hot stone. The diners do not recline, as the Athenians will do, but sit
on chairs; not at a central table but along the walls, with little
tables between the seats. There are no forks, spoons, or napkins, and
only such knives as the guests may carry; eating is managed with the
fingers.® The staple drink, even among the poor and among children, is
diluted wine.</p>
<p>The land is owned by the family or the clan, not by the individual;
the father administers and controls it, but he r^nnot sell it.® In the
Iliad great tracts are</p>

<p>called the King’s Commons or Demesne {temenos)  in effect it belongs
to the community, and in its fields any man may pasture his flocks. In
the Odyssey these common lands are being divided, and sold to — or
appropriated by — rich or strong individuals; the commons disappears in
ancient Greece precisely as in modem England.®</p>
<p>The soil might yield metal as well as food; but the Achaeans neglect
to mine the earth, and are content to import copper and tin, silver and
gold, and a strange new luxury, iron. A shapeless mass of iron is
offered as a precious prize at the games held in honor of Patroclus,® it
will make, says Achilles, many an agricultural implement. He says
nothing of weapons, which are still of bronze.® The Odyssey describes
the tempering of iron,’’^ but that epic probably belongs to a later age^
than the Iliad.</p>
<p>The smith at his forge and the potter at his wheel work in their
shops; other Homeric craftsmen — saddlers, masons, carpenters,
cabinetmakers — go to work at the home that has ordered their product.
They do not produce for a market, for sale or profit; they work long
hours, but leisurely, without the sting and stimulus of visible
competition.® The family itself provides most of its needs; everyone in
it labors with his hands; even the master of the house, even the local
king, like Odysseus, makes bed and chairs for his home, boots and
saddles for himself; and unlike the later Greeks he prides himself on
his manual skill. Penelope, Helen, and Andromache, as well as their
servant women, are busy with spinning, weaving, embroidery, and
household cares; Helen seems lovelier when she displays her needlework
to Telemachus®* than when she walks in beauty on the battlements of
Troy.</p>
<p>The craftsmen are freemen, never slaves as in classic Greece.
Peasants may in emergency be conscripted to labor for the king, but we
do not hear of serfs bound to the soil. Slaves are not numerous, nor is
their position degraded; they are mostly female domestics, and occupy a
position in effect as high as that of household servants today, except
that they are bought and sold for long terms instead of for precariously
brief engagements. On occasion they are brutally treated; normally they
are accepted as members of the family, are cared for in illness or
depression or old age, and may develop a humane relation of aflFection
with master or mistress. Nausicaa helps her bondwomen tp wash the family
linen in the stream, plays ball with them, and altogether treats them as
com- panions.® If a slave woman bears a son to her master, the child is
usually free.® Any man, however, may become a slave, through capture in
battle or in piratical raids. This is the bitterest aspect of Achaean
life.</p>
<p>Homeric society is rural and local; even the “cities” are mere
villages nestling against hilltop citadels. Communication is by
messenger or herald, or, over</p>
<p>• “When a smith tempers in cold water a great ax or an adze, it gives
off a hissing; this is what gives iron its strength.*’^</p>

<p>long distances, by signal fires flashing from peak to peak.® Overland
traffic is made difficult and dangerous by roadless mountains and swamps
and bridgeless streams. The carpenter makes carts with four wheels
boasting of spokes and wooden tires; even so most goods are carried by
mules or men. Trade by sea is easier, despite pirates and storms;
natural harbors are numerous, and only on the perilous four-day trip
from Crete to Egypt does the ship lose sight of land. Usu- ally the boat
is beached at night, and crew and passengers sleep on trusty land. In
this age the Phoenicians are still better merchants and mariners than
the Greeks. The Greeks revenge themselves by despising trade, and
preferring piracy.</p>
<p>The Homeric Greeks have no money, but use, as media for exchange,
ingots of iron, bronze, or gold; the ox or cow is taken as a standard of
value. A gold ingot of fifty-seven pounds is called a talent {talanton^
weight).® Much barter remains. Wealth is computed realistically in
goods, especially cattle, rather than in pieces of metal or paper that
may lose or alter their value at any moment through a change in the
economic theology of men. There are rich and poor in Homer as in life;
society is a rumbling cart that travels an uneven road; and no matter
how carefully the cart is constituted, some of the varied objects in it
will sink to the bottom, and others will rise to the top; the potter has
not made all the vessels of the same earth, or strength, or fragility.
Already in the second book of the Iliad we hear the sound of the class
war; and as Thersites flies oratorically at Agamemnon we recognize an
early variation on a persistent theme.®</p>
<p>Z. Morals</p>
<p>As we read Homer the impression forms that we are in the presence of
a society more lawless and primitive than that of Cnossus or Mycenae.
The Achaean culture is a step backward, a transition between the
brilliant Aegean civilization and the Dark Age that will follow the
Dorian conquest. Homeric life is poor in art, rich in action; it is
unmeditative, buoyant, swift; it is too young and strong to bother much
about manners or philosophy. Probably we misjudge it by seeing it in the
violent crisis or disorderly aftermath of war.</p>
<p>There are, it is true, many tender qualities and scenes. Even the
warriors are generous and affectionate; between parent and child there
is a love as profound as it is silent. Odysseus kisses the heads and
shoulders of the members of his family when, after their long
separation, they recognize him; and in like manner they kiss him.*®
Helen and Menelaus weep when they learn that this noble lad, Telemachus,
is the son of the lost Odysseus who fought so valiantly for them.”
Agamemnon himself is capable of tears</p>

<p>SO abundant that they remind Homer of a stream pouring over rocks.“
Friendships are firm among the heroes, though possibly a degree of
sexual inversion enters into the almost neurotic attachment of Achilles
to Patroclus, especially to Patroclus dead. Hospitality is lavish, for
“from Zeus are all strangers and beggars.”“ Maids bathe the foot or the
body of the guest, anoint him with unguents, and may give him fresh
garments; he receives food and lodging if he needs them, and perhaps a
gift.“ “Lo,” says “fair - cheeked Helen,” as she places a costly robe in
Telemachus’ hands, “I too give thee this gift, dear child, a remembrance
of the hands of Helen, against the day of thy longed- for marriage, for
thy bride to wear.”“ It is a picture that reveals to us the human
tenderness and fine feeling that in the Iliad must hide themselves under
the panoply of war.</p>
<p>Even war does not thwart the Greek passion for games. Children and
adults engage in skillful and difficult contests, apparently with
fairness and good humor; Penelope’s suitors play draugh ts, and throw
the disk or jave- lin; the Phaeacian hosts of Odysseus play at quoits,
and a strange medley of ball and dance.* When the dead PatroHus has been
cremated, according to Achaean custom, games are played that set a
precedent for Olympia — foot races, disk-throwing, javelin-throwing,
archery, wrestling, chariot races, and single combat fully armed; all in
excellent spirit, except that only the ruling class may enter, and only
the gods may cheat.“</p>
<p>The other side of the picture is less pleasing. As a prize for the
chariot race Achilles offers “a woman skilled in fair handiwork”; and on
the</p>
<p>funeral pyre horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, and human beings are
sacrificed to keep the dead Patroclus well tended and fed.“ Achilles
treats Priam with fine courtesy, but only after dragging Hector’s body
in mangled ignominy around the pyre. To the Achaean male, human life is
cheap; to take it is no serious matter; a moment’s pleasure can replace
it. When a town is captured the men are killed or sold into slavery; the
women are taken as concubines if they are attractive, as slaves if they
are not. Piracy is still a respected occupation; even kings organize
marauding expeditions, plunder towns and villages, and enslave their
population; “Indeed,” says Thuc yd- ides, “this came to be the main
source of livelihood among the early Hel -</p>
<p>• “Then Alcinous ordered Halias and Laodamas to dance, by themselves,
for never did any one dare join himself with them. They took in their
hands the fine ball, purple-dyed… and played. Tlie first, bending his
body right back, would hurl the ball towards the shadowy crowds, while
the other in his turn would spring high into the air and catch it
gracefully before his feet touched the ground. Then, after they had made
full trial of tossing the ball high, they began passing it back and
forth between them, all the while they danced upon the fruitful
earth.“’“</p>

<p>lenes, no disgrace being yet attached to such an occupation,”“ but
some glory; very much as, in our times, great nations may conquer and
subjugate defenseless peoples without loss of dignity or righteousness.
Odysseus is in- sulted when he is asked is he a merchant, “mindful of
the gains of his greed”;“ but he tells with prid e how, on his return
from Troy, his provisions having run low, he sacked the city of Ismarus
and stored his ships with food; or how he ascended the river Aegyptus
“to pillage the splendid fields, to carry off the women and little
children, and to kill t he men.”“ No city is safe from sudden and
unprovoked attack.</p>
<p>To this lighthearted relish for robbery and slaughter the Achaeans
add an unabashed mendacity. Odysseus can hardly speak without lying, or
act without treachery. Having captured the Trojan scout Dolon, he and
Diomed promise him life if he will give them the information they
require; he does, and they kill him.“ It is true that the other Achaeans
do not quite equal Odysseus in dishonesty, but not because they would
not; they envy and admire him, and look up to him as a model character;
the poet who pictures him considers him a hero in every respect; even
the goddess Ath- ena praises him for his lying, and counts this among
the special charms for which she loves him. “Cunning must he be and
knavish,” she tells him, smiling, and stroking him with her hand, “who
would go beyond thee in all manner of guile, aye, though it were a god
that met thee. Bold man, crafty in counsel, insatiate in deceit, not
even in thine own land, it seems, wast thou to cease from guile and
deceitful tales, which thou lovest from the bottom of thine heart.”“</p>
<p>In truth we ourselves are drawn to this heroic Munchausen of the
ancient world. We discover some likable traits in him, and in the hardy
and subtle people to which he belongs. He is a gentle father, and in his
own kingdom a just ruler, who “wrought no wrong in deed or word to any
man in the land.” “Never again,” says his swineherd, “shall I find a
master so kind, how far soever I go, not though I come again to the
house of my father and mother!”“ We envy Odysseus his “form like unto
the immortals,” his frame so athletic that though nearing fifty he
throws the disk farther than any of the Phaeacian youths; we admire his
“steadfast heart,” his “wis - d om like to Jove’s”;“ and our sympathy
goes out to him when, in his</p>
<p>despair of ever seeing again “the smoke leaping up from his own
land,” he yearns to die, or when, in the midst of his perils and
sufferings, he steels himself with words that old Socrate s loved to
quote: “Be patient now, my soul; thou hast endured stiU worse than
this.”“ He is a man of iron in body and mind, yet every inch human, and
therefore forgivable.</p>
<p>50 THELIFEOr GREECE (CHAP. HI</p>
<p>The secret of the matter is that the Achaean’s standard of judgment
is as different from ours as the virtues of war differ from those of
peace. He lives in a disordered, harassed, hungry world, where every man
must be his own policeman, ready with arrow and spear, and a capacity
for look- ing calm ly at flowing blood. “A ravening belly,” as Odysseus
explains, “no man can hide…. Because of it are the benched ships made

<p>Achaean society is a patriarchal despotism tempered with the beauty
and anger of woman, and the fierce tenderness of parental love.*
Theoretically the father is supreme: he may take as many concubines as
he likes,f he may offer them to his guests, he may expose his children
on the mountaintops to die, or slaughter them on the altars of the
thirsty gods. Such paternal omnip- otence does not necessarily imply a
brutal society, but only one in which the organization of the state has
not yet gone far enough to preserve so- cial order; and in which the
family, to create such^order, needs the powers that will later be
appropriated by the state in a nationalization of the right to kill. As
social organization advances, paternal authority and family unity
decrease, freedom and individualism grow. In practice the Achaean male
is usually reasonable, listens patiently to domestic eloquence, and is
devoted to his children.</p>
<p>Within the patriarchal framework the position of woman is far higher
in Homeric than it will be in Periclean Greece. In the legends and
the</p>
<p>• There are vestiges of an earlier and “matriarchal” condition:
before Cecrops, said Athenian tradition, “children did not know their
own father” -i.e., presumably, descent was reckoned through the mother;
and even in Homeric days many of the gods especially wor- shiped by
Greek cities were goddesses — Hera at Argos, Athena at Athens, Demeter
and Persephone at Eleusis — with no visible subordination to any male
deity t Tneseus had so many wives that an historian drew up a learned
catalogue of them*</p>

<p>epics she plays a leading role, from Pelops’ courtship of Hippodameia
to Iphigenia’s gentleness and Electra’s hate. The gynaeceum does not
confine her, nor does the home; she moves freely among men and women
ahke, and occasionally shares in the serious discourse of the men, as
Helen does with Menelaus and Telemachus. When the Achaean leaders wish
to fire the imagination of their people against Troy they appeal not to
political or racial or religious ideas, but to the sentiment for woman’s
beauty; the loveliness of Helen must put a pretty face upon a war for
land and trade. Without woman the Homeric hero would be a clumsy boor,
with nothing to live for or die for; she teaches him something of
courtesy, idealism, and softer ways.</p>
<p>Marriage is by purchase, usually in oxen or their equivalent, paid by
the suitor to the father of the girl; th e poet speaks of “cattle -
bringing maidens.”“ The purchase is reciprocal, for the father usually
gives the bride a substan- tial dowry. The ceremony is familial and
religious, with much eating, dancing, and loose- tongued merriment.
“Beneath a blaze of to rches they led the brides from their chambers
through the city, and loud rose the bridal song. The young men whirled
in the dance, and high among them did sound the flute and the lyre”;“ so
changeless are the essentials of our life. Once married, the woman
becomes mistress in her home, and is honored in proportion to her
children. Love in the truest sense, as a profound mutual tenderness and
solicitude, comes to the Greeks, as to the French, after marriage rather
than before; it is not the spark thrown off by the contact or nearness
of two bodies, but the fruit of long association in the cares and
industries of the home. The Homeric wife is as faithful as her husband
is not. There are three adulteresses in Homer — Clytaemnestra, Helen,
and Aphrodite; but they do injustice to the mortal average, if not to
the divine.</p>
<p>Formed out of this background, the Homeric family (barring the enor-
mities of legends that play no part in Homer) is a wholesome and
pleasing institution, rich in fine women and loyal children. The woipen
function not only as mothers but as workers; they grind the grain, card
the wool, spin, weave, and embroider; they do little sewing, since
garments are mostly without seams; and cooking is normally left to men.
Amid these labors they bear and rear children, heal their hurts, pacify
their quarrels, and teach them the manners, morals, and traditions of
the tribe. There is no formal education, apparently no teaching of
letters, no spelling, no gram- mar, no books; it is a boy’s u topia. The
girl is taught the arts of the home, the boy those of the chase and war;
he learns to ^sh and swim, to till the fields, set snares, handle
animals, aim the arrow and the lance, and take</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>5 *</p>
<p>(CHAP.ni</p>
<p>care of himself in all the emergencies of a half-lawless life. When
the oldest boy grows up to manhood he becomes, in the absence of his
father, the responsible head of the family. When he marries he brings
his bride to his father’s home, and the rhythm of the gener ations is
renewed. The individual members of the family change with time, but the
family is the lasting unit, surviving perhaps for centuries, and forging
in the turbulent crucible of the home the order and character without
which all government is in vain.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Arts</li>
</ol>
<p>The Achaeans leave to merchants and lowly scribes the art of writing,
which has presumably been handed down to them from Mycenaean Greece;
they pre- fer blood to ink and flesh to clay. In all of Homer there is
but one reference to writing,“ and there in a characteristic context; a
folded tablet is given to a mes - senger, directing the recipient to
kill the messenger. If the Achaeans have time for literature it is only
when war and marauding allow a peaceful interlude; the king or prince
gathers his retainers about him for a feast, and some wandering
minstrel, stringing the lyre, recounts in simple.verse the exploits of
ancestrd heroes; this is, for the Achaeans, both poetry and history.
Homer, perhaps wishing like Pheidias to engrave his own portrait upon
his work, tells how Alcinous, King of the Phaeacians, calls for such
song in entertaining Odysseus. “Summon hither the divine minstrel,
Demodocus; for to him above all others has the god granted skill in
song…. Then the herald drew near, leading the good minstrel, whom the
Muse loved above all other men, and gave him both good and evil; of his
sight she deprived him, but gave him the gift of sweet song.”“</p>
<p>The only art except his own that interests Homer is toreutics-^he
hammer- ing of metals into plastic forms. He says nothing of painting or
sculpture, but ralk up all his inspiration to describe the scenes inlaid
or damascened upon Achilles’ shield, or raised in relief upon Odysseus’
brooch. He speaks briefly but Uluminatingly about architecture. The
common dwelling in Homer is apparently of sun-dried brick with a footing
of stone; the floor is ordinarily of beaten earth, and is cleaned by
scraping; the roof is of reeds overlaid with clay, and slopes only
enough to carry off the rain. The doors are single or double, and may
have bolts or keys.“ In the better dwellings the interior walls are of
painted stucco, with ornamental border or frieze, and are hung with
weapons, shields, and tapestries. There is no kitchen, no chimney, no
windows; an open- ing in the roof of the central hall lets out some of
the smoke that may rise from the hearth; the rest finds its way through
the door, or settles in soot on the walls. Rich establi^iments have a
bathroom; others content themselves with a tub.</p>

<p>53</p>
<p>The furniture is of heavy wood, often artistically carved and
finished; Icmalius fashions for Penelope an armchair set with ivory and
precious metals; and Odysseus makes for himself and his wife a massive
bedstead designed to last for a century.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the age that its architecture ignores temples
and spends itself upon palaces, just as Periclean architecture will
neglect palaces and lavish itself upon temples. We h ear of the
“sumptuous home of Paris, which that prince had built with the aid of
the most cunning architects in Troy”;“ of King Alcinous’ great mansion,
with walls of bronze, frieze of blue -glass paste, doors of silver and
gold, and other features that may belong rather to poetry than to
architecture; we hear something of Agamemnon’s royal residence at
Mycenae,</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The State</li>
</ol>
<p>How are these passionate and vigorous Achaeans ruled? In peace by the
family, in crisis by the clan. The clan is a group {genos, literally a
genus) of persons acknowledging a common ancestor and a common chief-
tain. The citadel of the chieftain is the origin and center of the city;
there, as his force subsides into usage and law, clan after clan
gathers, and makes a political as well as a kinship community. When the
chieftain desires some united action from his clan or city, he summons
its free males to a public assembly, and submits to them a proposal
which they may accept or reject, but which only the most important
members of the group may propose to change. In this village assembly —
the one democratic element in an essentially feudal and aristocratic
society — skilled speakers who can sway the people are valuable to the
state; already, in old Nestor, whose voice “flows sweeter than honey
from his tongue,”“ and in wily Odysseus, whose words fall “like
snowflakes upon the people,”“ we have the beginnings of</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>54 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. HI</p>
<p>hat stream of eloquence which will reach greater heights in Greece
than in any other civilization, and will finally submerge it in
ruin.</p>
<p>When all the clans must act at once the chieftains follow the lead of
the strongest of their number as king, and report to him with their
armies of freemen and attendant slaves. Those chieftains who are nearest
to the king in residence and respect are called the King’s Companions;
they will be called that again in Philip’s Macedonia and in Alexander’s
camp. In their boule, or council, the nobles exercise full freedom of
speech, and address the king as merely and temporarily first among
equals. Out of these insti- tutions — public assembly, council of
nobles, and king — will come, in a hun- dred varieties and under a
thousand shibboleths and phrases, the constitu- tions of the modem
Western world.</p>
<p>The powers of the king are narrowly limited and very wide. They are
limited in space, for his kingdom is small. They are limited in time,
for he may be deposed by the Council, or by a right which the Achaeans
read- ily recognize — the right of the stronger. Otherwise his rale is
hereditary, and has only the vaguest boundaries. He is above all a
military commander, solicitous for his army, without which he might be
found in the wron^. He sees to it that it is well equipped, well fed,
well trained; that it has poi - soned arrows,** lances, helmets,
greaves, spears, breastplates, shields, and chariots. So long as the
army defends him he is the government — legisla- ture, executive,
judiciary. He is the high priest of the state religion, and sacrifices
for the people. His decrees are the laws, and his decisions are final;
there is as yet no word for law.** Below him the Council may sit occa-
sionally to judge grave disputes; then, as if to set a precedent for all
courts, it asks for precedents, and decides accordingly. Precedent
dominates law because precedent is custom, and custom is the jealous
older brother of law. Trials of any kind, however, are rare in Homeric
society; there are hardly any public agencies of justice; each family
must defend and revenge itself. Violence abounds.</p>
<p>To support his establishment the king does not levy taxes; he
receives, now and then, “gifts” from his subjects. But he would be a
poor king if he depended upon such presents. His chief income is
derived, presumably, from tolls on the plunder that his soldiers and his
ships gather on land or sea. Perhaps that is why, late in the thirteenth
century, the Achaeans are found in Egypt and Crete; in Egypt as
unsuccessful buccaneers, in Crete as passing conquerors. Then, suddenly,
we hear of them inflaming their people with a tale of humiliating rape,
collecting all the forces of all the tribes, equipping a hundred
thousand men, and sailing in a vast and un-</p>

<li>THE SIEGE OF TROY</li>
</ol>
<p>Was there such a siege? We only know that every Greek historian, and
every Greek poet, and almost every temple record or legend in Greece,
took it for granted; that archeology has placed the ruined city,
generously multiplied, before our eyes; and that today, as until the
last century, the story and its heroes are accepted as in essence real.“
An Egyptian inscrip- tion of Rameses III reports that “the isles were
restless” toward 1 196 b.c.;** and Pliny alludes to a Rameses “in whose
time Troy fell.”“ The great</p>
<p>The ancient Persians and Phoenicians agreed with the Greeks in
tracing the great war to four abductions of beautiful women. The
Egyptians, they said, stole lo from Argos, the Greeks stole Europa from
Phoenicia, and Medea from Colchis; did not a just balancing of the
scales require that Paris should abduct Helen?*“ Stesichorus in his
penitent years, and after him Herodotus and Euripides, refused to admit
that Helen had gone to Troy; she had only gone to Egypt, under
constraint, and had merely waited there a dozen years for Menelaus to
come and find her; besides, asked Herodotus, who could believe that the
Trojans would fight ten years for one woman? Euripides attributed the
expedition to excess population in Greece , and the consequent urge to
expansion;™ so old are the youngest excuses of the will to power.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is possible that some such story was used to make the
adventure digestible for the common Greek; men must have phrases if they
are to give their lives. Whatever may have been the face and shibboleth
of the war, its cause and essence lay, almost beyond doubt, in the
struggle of two groups of powers for possession of the Hellespont and
the rich lands lying about the Black Sea. All Greece and all western
Asia saw it as a decisive conflict; the little nations of Greece came to
the aid of Agamemnon, and the peoples of Asia Minor sent repeated
reinforcements to Troy. It was the beginning of a struggle that would be
renewed at Marathon and</p>

<p>Of the events and aftermath of the war we can relate only what the
poets and dramatists of Greece have told us; we accept this as rather
litera- ture than history, but all the more for that reason a part of
the story of civilization; we know that war is ugly, and that the Iliad
is beautiful. Art (to vary Aristotle) may make even terror beautiful —
and so purify it — by giving it significance and form. Not that the form
of the Iliad is perfect; the structure is loose, the narrative is
sometimes contradictory or obscure, the conclusion does not conclude;
nevertheless the perfection of the parts atones for the disorder of the
whole, and with all its minor faults the story becomes one of the great
dramas of literature, perhaps of history.</p>

<li><ul>
<li>At the opening of the poem the Greeks have already besieged Troy for
nine years in vain; they are despondent, homesick, and decimated with
disease. They had been delayed at Aulis by sickness and a windless sea;
and Agamem- non had embittered Clytaemnestra, and prepared his own fate,
by sacrificing their daughter Iphigenia for a breeze. On the way up the
coast the Greeks had stopped here and there to replenish their supplies
of food and concubines; Aga- memnon had taken the fair Chryseis,
Achilles the fair Briseis. A soothsayer now declares that Apollo is
withholding success from the Greeks because Aga- memnon has violated the
daughter of Apollo’s priest, Chryses. The King restores Chryseis to her
father, but, to console himself and point a tale, he com- p els Briseis
to leave Achilles and take Chryseis’ place in the royal tent. Achilles
convokes a general assembly, and denounces Agamemnon with a wrath that
provides the first word and the recurring theme of the Iliad. He vows
that neither he nor his soldiers will any longer stir a hand to help the
Greeks.</li>

(m) see bluff Menelaus engaging Paris in single combat to decide the
war. The two armies sit down in civilked truce; Priam joins Agamemnon in
solemn sacrifice to the gods. Menelaus overcomes Paris, but Aphrodite
snatches the lad safely away in a cloud and deposits him, miraculously
powdered and perfumed, upon his marriage bed, Helen bids him return to
the fight, but he counterproposes that they “give the hour to
dalliance.” The lady, flattered by desire, yields, (iv) Agamemnon
declares Menelaus victor, and the war is apparently ended; but the gods,
in imitative council on Olympus, demand more blood. Zeus votes for
peace, but withdraws his vote in terrkied retreat when Hera, his spouse,
directs her speech upon him. She suggests that if Zeus will agree to the
destruc- tion of Troy she will allow him to raze Mycenae, Argos, and
Sparta to the</li>

<li>The gods join in the merry slicing game; Ares, the awful god of war,
is hurt by D iomed’s spear, “utters a cry as of nine thousand men,” and
runs off to complain to Zeus, (vi) In a pretty interlude the Trojan
leader Hector, before rejoining the battle, bids good- by to his wife
Andromache. “Love,” she whis - pers to him, “thy stout hea rt will be
thy death; nor hast thou pity of thy child or me, who shall soon be a
widow. My father and my mother and my brothers all are slain; but.
Hector, thou art faAer to me and mother, and thou art the husband of my
youth. Have pity, then, and stay here in the tower.” “Full well I know,”
he answers, “that Troy will fall, and I foresee the sorrow of my breth -
ren and the King; for them I grieve not; but to think of thee a slave in
Argos unmans me almost. Yet, even so, I will not shirk the fight.”” His
infant son Astyanax, destined shortly to be flung over the walls to
death by the victorious Greeks, screams in fright at Hector’s waving
plumes, and the hero removes his helmet that he may laugh, weep, and
pray over the wondering child. Then he strides down the causeway to the
battle, and (vii) engages Ajax, King of Salamis, in single combat. They
fight bravely, and separate at nightfall with exchange of praise and
gifts — a flower of courtesy floating on a sea of blood, (viii) After a

<p>V. THE HOME-COMING</p>
<p>Here the great poem suddenly ends, as if the poet had used up his
share of a common story, and mus t leave the rest to another minstrel’s
lay. We are told by the later literature how Paris, standing beside the
battle, slew Achilles with an arrow that pierced his vulnerable heel,
and how Troy fell at last through the stratagem of the wooden horse.</p>
<p>The victors themselves were vanquished by their victory, and returned
in ?veary sadness to their longed-for homes. Many of them were ship-
wrecked, and some of these, stranded on alien shores, founded Greek col-
onies in Asia, the Aegean, and Italy.™ Men elaus, who had vowed that he
would kill Helen, fell in love with her anew when the “goddess among
women” came to him in the calm majesty of her loveliness; gladly he took
her back to be his queen again in Sparta. When Agamemnon reached Mycenae
he “clas ped his land and kissed it, and many were the hot tears that
streamed from his eyes.”” But during his long absence Clytaemnestra</p>
<p>Sadder still was the home-coming of Odysseus; and here probably an-
other Homer has told the tale in a poem less powerful and heroic,
gentler and pleasanter, than the Iliad* Odysseus, says the Odyssey, is
shipwrecked on the island of Ogygia, a fairyland Tahiti, whose
goddess-queen Calypso holds him as her lover for eight years while
secretly he pines for his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus, who pine
for him at Ithaca.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Athena persuades Zeus to bid Calypso let Odysseus depart. The
goddess flies to Telemach us, and hears with sympathy the youth’s simple
tale: how the princes of Ithaca and its vassal isles are paying court to
Penelope, seeking through her the throne, and how meanwhile they live
gaily in Odysseus’ palace, and consume his substance, (ii) Telemachus
bids the suitors disperse, but they laugh at his youth. Secretly he
embarks upon the sea in search of his father, while Penelope, mourning
now for both husband and son, holds off the suitors</li>
</ol>
<p>• Very probably the narrative in this instance has les s basis in
history than the Iliad. The legend of the long-wandering mariner or
warrior, whose wife cannot recognize him on his return, is apparently
older than the story of Troy, and appears in almost every literature.“
Odyssetis is the Sinuhe, the Sinbad, the Robinson Crusoe, the Enoch
Arden of the Greeks. The geography of the poem is a mystery that still
exercises leisurely minds.</p>

which she unweaves at night as much as she has woven by day. (ni)
Telemachus visits Nestor at Pylus and (iv) Menelaus at Sparta, but
neither can tell him where to find his father. The poet paints an
attractive picture of Helen settled and subdued, but still divinely
beautiful; she has long since been forgiven her sins, and remarks that
when Troy fell she had grown tired of the city anyway.*</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>Now for the first time Odysseus enters the tale. “Sitting on the
shore” of Calypso’s isle, “his eyes were djy of tea rs, and his sweet
life ebbed away, as he longed mournfully for his return. By night indeed
he would sleep by Calypso’s side perforce in the hollow caves, unwilliug
beside the willing nymph, but by day he would sit on the rocks and the
sands, rocking his soul with tears and groans, and looking over the
unresting sea.’”* Calypso, having detained him one night more, bids him
make a raft and set out alone.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="i">
<li><p>After many stm^les with the ocean, Odysseus lands in the m3^cal
country of Phaeacia (possibly Corcyra-Corfu), and is found by the maiden
Nausicaa, who leads him to the palace of her father. King Alcinous. The
lass falls in love with the strong-limbed, strong-hearted hero, and
confides to her companions: “Listen, my white -armed maidens…. Erewhile
this man seemed to me uncomely, but now he is like the gods that keep
wide heaven. Would that such a one might be called my husband, dwelling
here, and that it might please him here to abide.”” (vn -vin) Odysseus
makes so good an impression that Alcinous offers him Nausicaa’s hand.
Odysseus excuses himself, but is glad to tell the story of his return
from Troy.</p></li>
<li><p>His ships (he tells the King) were borne off their course to the
land of the Lotus-Eaters, who gave his men such honey-sweet lotus fruit
that many forgot their homes and their longing, and Odysseus had to
force them back to ^eir ships. There they sailed to the land of the
Cyclopes, one-eyed giants who lived without law or labor on an island
abounding in wild grain and fruit. Caught in a cave by the Cyclop
Polyphemus, who ate several of his men, Odysseus saved the remnant by
lulling the monster to sleep with wine, and then burning out his single
eye. (x) TTie wanderers took again to the sea, and came to the land of
the Laestrygonians; but these, too, were cannibals, and onty Odysseus’
ship escaped them. He and his mates reached next the isle of Aenea,
where the lovely and treacherous goddess Circe lured most of them into
her cave with song, drugged them, and turned them into swine. Odysseus
was about to slay her when he changed his mind and accepted her love. He
and his comrades, now restored to human form, remained with Circe a full
year.</p></li>

<li>After her death, said Greek tradition, she was worshiped as a
goddess. It was a common belief in Greece that tiiose who spoke ill of
her were pnnished by the gods; even Homer’s</li>

<li>Setting sail again, they came to a land perpetually dark, which
proved to be the entrance to Hades; there Odysseus talked with the
shades of Agamemh non, Achilles, and his mother, (xn) Resuming their
voyage, they passed the island of the Sirens, against whose seductive
strains Odysseus protected his men by putting wax into their ears. In
the straits (Messina?) of Scylla and Charyb- dis his ship was wrecked,
and he alone survived, to live for eight long years on Calypso’s
isle.</li>
</ol>
<p>(xra) Alcinous is so moved with sympathy by Odysseus’ tale that he
bids his men row Odysseus to Ithaca, but to blindfold him lest he learn
and reveal the location of their happy land. On Ithaca the goddess
Athena guides the wanderer to the hut of his old swineherd Eumaeus, who
(xiv), though not recognizing him, receives him with Gargantuan
hospitality, (xv) When Telem- achus is led by the goddess to the same
hut Odysseus (xvi) makes himself known to his so n, and both ‘Svail
aloud vehemently.” He unfolds to Telem - achus a plan for slaying all
the suitors, (xvii-xvni) In the guise of a beggar he enters his palace,
sees the wooers feasting at his expense, and rages inwardly when he
hears that they lie with his maidservants at night even while court- ing
Penelope by day. (xnc-xx) He is insulted and injured by the suitors, but
he defends himself with vigor and patience, (xxi) By this time the
wooers have discovered the trick of Penelope’s web, and have forc ed her
to finish it. She agrees to marry whichever of them can string Odysseus’
great bow— which hangs on the wall — and shoot an arrow through the
openings of twelve axes ranged in line. They all try, and all fail.
Odysseus asks for a chance, and suc- ceeds. (xxii) Then with a wrath
that frightens everyone, he casts off his dis - guise, turns his arrows
upon the suitors, and, with the help of Tdemachus, Eumaeus, and Athena,
slays them all. (xxiii) He finds it hard to convince Penelope that he is
Odysseus; it is difiicult to surrender twenty suitors for one husband,
(xxiv) He meets the attack of the suitors’ sons, pacifies them, and
re-establidies his kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Argos the greatest tragedy in Greek legend was pursuing
its course. Orestes, son of Agamemnon, grown to manhood and aroused by
his bitter sister Electra, avenged their father by murdering their
mother and her paramour. After many years of madness and wandering
Orestes ascended the throne of Argos-Mycenae (ca. 1176 b.c.) and later
added Sparta to his kingdom.* But from his accession the house of Pelops
began to decline. Perhaps the decline had begim with Agamemnon, and

<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE DORIAN CONQUEST</li>
</ol>
<p>About the year 1104 b.c. a new wave of immigration or invasion came
down upon (Greece from the restlessly expanding north. Through Illyria
iud Thessaly, across the Corinthian Gulf at Naupactus, and over the
Isthmus St Corinth, a warlike people, tall, roundheaded, letterless,
slipped or marched or poured into the Peloponnesus, mastered it, and
almost com- pletely destroyed Mycenaean civilization. We guess at their
origin and their route, but we know their character and their effect.
They were still in the herding and hunting stage; now and then they
stopped to till the soil, but their main reliance was upon their cattle,
whose need for new pasturage kept the tribes ever on the move. One thing
they had in un- heard-of quantity — iron. They were the emissaries of
the Hallstatt* cul- ture to Greece; and the hard metal of their swords
and souls gave them a merciless supremacy over Achaeans and Cretans who
still used bronze to kill. Probably from both west and east, from Elis
and Megara, they came down upon the separate little kingdoms of the
Peloponnesus, put the ruling classes to the sword, and turned the
Mycenaean remnant into helot-serfs. Mycenae and Tiryns went up in
flames, and for some centuries Argos be- came the capital of Pelops’
isle. On the Isthmus the invaders seized a com - manding peak — the
Acrocorinthus — and built around it the Dorian city of Corinth.“® The
surviving Achaeans fled, some of them into the mountains of the northern
Peloponnesus, some into Attica, some overseas to the islands and coasts
of Asia. The conquerors followed them.into Attica, but were repulsed;
they followed them to Crete,“ and made final the destruction of Cnossus;
they captured and colonized Melos, Thera, Cos, Cnidus, and Rhodes.
Throughout the Peloponnesus and Crete, where the Mycenaean culture had
most flourished, the devastation was most complete.</p>
<p>This terminal catastrophe in the prehistory of Aegean civilization is

<p>don called the Return of the Heracleidae. For the victors were not
con- tent to record their triumph as a conquest of a civilized people by
bar- barians; they protested that what had really happened was that the
de- scendants of Heracles, resisted in their just re-entry into the
Peloponnesus, had taken it by heroic force. We do not know how much of
this is his- tory, and how much is diplomatic mythology designed to
transform a bloody conquest into a divine right. It is difficult to
believe that the Dorians were such excellent liars in the very youth of
the world. Perhaps, as dis- putants will never allow, both stories were
true: the Dorians were con- querors from the north, led by the scions of
Heracles.</p>
<p>Whatever the form of the conquest, its result was a long and bitter
inter- ruption in the development of Greece. Political order was
disturbed for centuries; every man, feeling unsafe, carried arms;
increasing violence dis- rupted agriculture and trade on land, and
commerce on the seas. War flourished, poverty deepened and spread. Life
became unsettled as families wa ndered from country to country seeking
security and peace.” Hesiod called this the Age of Iron, and mourned its
debasement from the finer ages that had preceded it; many Greeks
believed that “the discovery of iron had been to the hurt of man.”” The
arts languished, painting was neglected, statuary contented itself with
figurines; and pottery, forgetting the lively naturalism of Mycenae and
Crete, degenerated into a lifeless “Geometrical Style” that dominated
Greek ceramics for centuries.</p>
<p>But not all was lost. Despite the resolution of the invading Dorians
to keep their blood free from admixture with that of the subject
population — despite the racial antipathies between Dorian and Ionian
that were to incarnadine all Greece — there went on, rapidly outside of
Laconia, slowly within, a mingling of the new stocks with the old; and
perhaps the addi- tion of the vigorous seed of Achaeans and Dorians with
that of the more ancient and volatile peoples of southern Greece served
as a powerful bio- logical stimulant. The final result, after centuries
of mingling, was a new and diverse people, in whose blood
“Mediterranean,” “Alpine,” “Nordic,” and Asiatic elements were
disturbingly fused.</p>
<p>Nor was Mycenaean culture entirely destroyed. Certain elements of the
Aegean heritage — instrumentaUties of social order and government, ele-
ments of craftsmanship and technology, modes and routes of trade, forms
and objects of worship,” ceramic and toreutic skills, the art of fresco
paint - ing, decorative motives and architectural forms — maintained a
half-stifled existence through centiuies of violence and chaos. Cretan
institutions, the Greeks believed, passed down into Sparta;“ and the
Achaean assembly</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>(chap, m</p>
<p>remained the essential structure of even democratic Greece. The Myce-
naean megaron probably provided the ground plan of the Doric temple,“ to
which the Dorian spirit would add freedom, symmetry, and strength. The
artistic tradition, slowly reviving, lifted Corinth, Sicyon, and Argos
to an early Renaissance, and made even dour Sparta, for a while, smile
with art and song; it nourished lyric poetry through aU this historyless
Dark Age; it followed Pelasgian, Achaean, Ionian, Minyan exiles in their
flight-migra- tion to the Aegean and Asia, and helped the colonial
cities to leap ahead of their mother states in literature and art. And
when the exiles came to the islands and Ionia they found the remains of
Aegean civilization ready to their hands. There, in old towns a little
less disordered than on the Con- tinent, the Age of Bronze had kept
something of its ancient craft and brilliance; and there on Asiatic soil
would come the first reawakening of Greece.</p>
<p>In the end the contact of five cultures — Cretan, Mycenaean, Achaean,
Dorian, Oriental — brought new youth to a civilization that had begun to
die, that had grown coarse on the mainland through war and plunder, and
effeminate in Crete through the luxury of its genius. The mixture of
races and ways took centuries to win even a moderate stability, but it
contributed to produce the unparalleled variety, flexibility, and
subtlety of Greek thought and life. Instead of thinking of Greek culture
as a flame that shone suddenly and miraculously amid a dark sea of
barbarism, we must conceive of it as the slow and turbid creation of a
people almost too richly endowed in blood and memories, and surrounded,
challenged, and instructed by war- like hordes, powerful empires, and
ancient civilizations.</p>
