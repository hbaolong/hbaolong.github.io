and the Council</h4>
<p>i5 I 7“ 6 5</p>
<p>I. THE POPES AT BAY</p>
<p>W E have left to the last the difficult task, for a non-Catholic, of
under- standing and impartially describing the reaction of the popes to
the challenge of the Reformation.</p>
<p>It was at first a reaction of pained surprise. The popes of the
Reformation period, with perhaps one exception, were good men, so far as
statesmen are permitted so to be; not selfless or sinless, but basically
decent, humane, and intelligent, and sincerely convinced that the Church
was an institution not only magnificent in its achievements but still
indispensable to the moral health and mental peace of European man.
Granting that the human ministrants of the Church had fallen into
serious abuses, were there not equivalent or worse defects in every
secular administration? And if one should hesitate to over- throw civil
government because of the greed of princes and the peculations of
officials, should one hesitate any the less to subvert a Church that had
been for a thousand years, through religion, education, literature,
philosophy, and art, the nourishing mother of European civilization?
What if some dogmas that had been found helpful in promoting morality
and order seemed dif- ficult of digestion by the historian or the
philosopher — were the doctrines proposed by the Protestants so much
more rational or credible as to warrant turning Europe upside down over
the difference? In any case, religious doc- trines were determined not
by the logic of a few but by the needs of many; they were a frame of
belief within which the common man, inclined by nature to a hundred
unsocial actions, could be formed into a being sufficiently disciplined
and self-controlled to make society and civilization possible. Let that
frame be shattered, and another would have to be built, perhaps after
centuries of moral and psychical disorder; for were not the Reformers
agreed with the Church that a moral code would be ineffective unless
sup- ported by religious belief? As to the intellectual classes, were
they any freer or happier under Protestant princes than under Catholic
popes? # Had not</p>
<p>“Before the Lutheran revolt,” says one of the Church’s most powerful
and erudite critics, “there was much liberty of thought and speech
allowed throughout Catholic Europe.” — Henry C. Lea, History of the
Inquisition in Spain , III, 41 1.</p>
<p>917</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>918</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xart flowered under the leadership of the Church, and was it not
withering under the hostility of reformers who wished to take from the
people the images that fed the poetry and hope of their lives? What
commanding reasons were there, to mature minds, for atomizing
Christendom into countless sects, each vilifying and nullifying the
others, and individually powerless against the instincts of men?</p>
<p>We cannot know that these were the sentiments of the Reformation
popes, for the active leaders of men seldom publish their philosophies.
But we may so imagine the mood of Leo X (1513-21), who found the papacy
rocking under his feet so soon after he had been called to enjoy it. He
was a man like many of us — guilty of sin and criminal negligence, but,
all in all, forgivable. He was usually the kindest of men, feeding half
the poets of Rome; yet he pursued the heretics of Brescia to the death,
and tried to be- lieve that disruptive ideas could be roasted out of
mankind. He was as patient with Luther as could have been asked of a
pope and a Medici; imagine the tables turned, and how Pope Martin would
have blasted rebellious Leo from the earth! Leo mistook the Reformation
as an unmannerly dispute among unsophisticated monks. And yet, early in
1517, at the very outset of his pontificate, Gianfrancesco Pico della
Mirandola (nephew of the more famous Pico) had delivered before the Pope
and the cardinals a remarkable address “painting in the darkest manner
the corruption which had made its way into the Church,” and predicting
that “if Leo… re fuses to heal the wounds, it is to be feared that God
Himself will no longer apply a slow remedy, but will cut off and destroy
the diseased members with fire and sword.” 1 Despite this warning, Leo
absorbed himself in maintaining, for the protection of the Papal States,
a balance of power between France and the Empire; “he never gave a
thought,” says a Catholic historian, “to reform on the grand scale which
had become necessary…. The Roman Curia re- mained as worldly as ever.”
2</p>
<p>The best proof that reform could come only by a blow from without was
the failure of Adrian VI (1522-23). Candidly admitting the abuses, and
undertaking to reform them at the top, Adrian was ridiculed and reviled
by the Romans as threatening their supply of transalpine gold; and after
two years of contending against this unenlightened selfishness Adrian
died of frustration.</p>
<p>The accumulated storm burst upon the head of Clement VII (1523-34)
Intellectually and morally he was among the best popes, humane and
gener- ous, defending the hounded Jews, taking no part in the sexual or
financial looseness that surrounded him, and continuing to the end of
his troubled life to nourish with discriminating patronage the art and
literature of Italy. Perhaps he was too well educated to be a successful
administrator; his in- tellect was keen enough to see good reasons for
every course in every crisis;</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXDt) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 919</p>
<p>his knowledge sapped his courage, and his vacillations alienated
power after power. We cannot withhold all sympathy from a man so well
intentioned; who saw Rome sacked under his eyes, and himself imprisoned
by a mob and an emperor; who was prevented by that Emperor from seeking
a reasonable peace with Henry VIII; who had to make the bitter choice
between losing Henry and England or Charles and Germany; who, when he
protested against the alliance of Francis with the Turks, was told by
that Most Chris- tian King that if the Pope protested further, France
would divorce itself from the papacy. Never had a pope drunk the cup of
office to such bitter dregs.</p>
<p>His errors were catastrophic. When he miscalculated the character and
resources of Charles, and so invited the Sack of Rome, he dealt the
prestige of the papacy a blow that emboldened northern Germany to
renounce allegiance to Rome. When he crowned the man who had permitted
that at- tack he lost the respect of even the Catholic world. He yielded
to Charles partly through lack of material power to resist, partly
because he feared that an alienated Emperor would call a general council
of laity as well as clergy, would seize the reins of both ecclesiastical
and secular authority, would complete the subjection of the Church to
the rampant state, might even de- pose him as a bastard. 8 If he had had
the courage that his uncle Lorenzo de’ Medici had shown at Naples in
1479, Clement would have taken the initi- ative, and would have called a
council that under his liberal leadership might have reformed the morals
and doctrine of the Church, and saved the unity of Western
Christendom.</p>
<p>His successor seemed at first sight to have all the requisites of
both intellect and character. Born in. a rich and cultured family,
instructed in the classics by Pomponius Laetus, maturing as a humanist
among the Medici in Florence, favored by a pope whom his sister had
entangled in her golden hair, made a cardinal at twenty-five (1493),
proving his mettle in difficult diplomatic assignments, rising to
unquestioned pre-eminence in the college of cardinals, and unanimously
elected pope in 153 4, Alessandro Famese, as Paul III, was universally
recognized as the right man for the highest office in the Christian
world. The esteem in which he was held suffered little from his having
be- gotten four children before his ordination as a priest (1519). Yet
his char- acter, like his career, showed uncertainty and contradictions,
partly because he stood like a shaken pillar between the Renaissance
that he loved and a Reformation that he could not understand or forgive.
Frail in body, he survived fifteen years of political and domestic
storms. Equipped with all the learning of his time, he regularly
resorted to astrologers to determine the most favorable hour for a
journey, a decision, even an audience. 4 A man of strong feeling, and
given now and then to bursts of anger, he was noted for his self-
control. Cellini, whom he had to imprison, described him “as one</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>X920</p>
<p>who had no faith in God or aught beside”; B this seems extreme; and
certainly Paul had faith in himself until, in his final years, the
behavior of his progeny weakened his will to live. He was punished where
he had sinned; he re- stored the nepotism that had marked the
Renaissance papacy, gave Piacenza and Parma to his son Pierluigi and
Camerino to his grandson Ottavio, be- stowed the red hat on his nephews,
fourteen and seventeen years old, and promoted them despite their
notorious immorality. He had character with- out morals, and intellect
without wisdom.</p>
<p>He recognized the justice of the criticisms directed by the Reformers
at the administration of the Church, and if ecclesiastical amendment had
been the only obstacle to reconciliation he might have ended the
Reformation. In 1535 he sent Pierpaolo Vergerio to sound out Protestant
leaders about at- tending a general council, but he would not promise to
allow any substantial change in the defined faith or in the authority of
the popes. Vergerio re- turned from Germany worse than empty-handed, for
he reported that Cath- olics there joined Protestants in doubting the
Pope’s sincerity in proposing a council, 6 and that Archduke Ferdinand
complained that he could find no confessor who was not a fornicator, a
drunkard, or an ignoramus. 7 Paul tried again in 1536; he commissioned
Peter van der Vorst to arrange terms with the Lutherans for a council,
but Peter was rebuffed by the Elector of Saxony, and achieved nothing.
Finally Paul made the culminating effort of the Church to reach an
understanding with her critics: he sent to a con- ference at Ratisbon
Cardinal Gasparo Contarini, a man of unquestioned sincerity in the
Catholic movement for reform.</p>
<p>We cannot withhold sympathy from the old cardinal who braved the
snows of Apennines and Alps in February and March 1541, eager to crown
his life with the organization of religious peace. Everyone at Ratisbon
was impressed by his modesty, simplicity, and good will. He mediated
with saintly patience between the Catholic Eck, Pflug, and Gropper, and
the Protestant Melanchthon, Bucer, and Pistorius. Agreement was reached
on original sin, free will, baptism, confirmation, and holy orders, and
on May 3 Co ntarini wrote joyfully to Cardinal Famese: “God be praised!
Yesterday the Catholic and Protestant theologians came to an agreement
on the doc- trine of justification.” But on the Eucharist no acceptable
compromise could be found. The Protestants would not admit that a priest
could transform bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ; and
the Catholics felt that to surrender transubstantiation would be to give
up the very heart of the Mass and the Roman ritual. Contarini returned
to Rome exhausted with failure and grief, only to be branded as a
Lutheran by the rigidly orthodox followers of Cardinal Caraffa. Paul
himself was not clear that he could accept the formulas that Contarini
had signed; however, he gave him a friendly wel-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 921</p>
<p>come, and appointed him papal legate at Bologna. There, five months
after his arrival, Contarini died.</p>
<p>The politics of religion became ever more cloudy and confused. Paul
wondered if reconciliation of the Protestants with the Church would give
Charles V so united and peaceful a Germany that the Emperor would be
free to turn south and connect his north and south Italian realms by ap-
propriating the Papal States and ending the temporal power of the popes.
Francis I, likewise dreading the pacification of Germany, charged
Contarini with having shamefully surrendered to heretics, and he pledged
his full support to Paul if the Pope would firmly reject peace with the
Lutherans 8 — with whom Francis sought alliance. Paul seems to have
decided that a religious understanding would be politically ruinous. In
1538, by brilliant diplomacy, he brought Charles and Francis to sign a
truce at Nice; then, having made Charles secure in the west, he urged
him to fall upon the Lutherans. When Charles neared victory (1546) Paul
withdrew the papal contingent that he had sent to him, for again he
trembled lest an Emperor with no Protestant problem in his rear would be
tempted to subdue all Italy. The Pope became a pro-tempore Protestant,
and viewed Lutheranism as a protector of the papacy — much as Suleiman
had been a protector of Luther- anism. Meanwhile his other shield
against Charles — Francis I — was allying himself with Turks who
repeatedly threatened to invade Italy and attack Rome. Some vacillation
may be forgiven to a pope so harassed and beset, armed with a handful of
troops, and defended by a faith that only the weak seemed to cherish. We
perceive how small a role religion played in these struggles for power
when we hear the comment of Charles to the papal nuncio on learning that
Paul was turning to France: the Pope, said the Em- peror, had caught in
old age an infection usually acquired in youth, the morbus gallicus, the
French disease. 9</p>
<p>Paul neither stopped Protestantism nor effected any substantial
reforms, but he revitalized the papacy and restored it to grandeur and
influence. He remained to the end a Renaissance pope. He encouraged and
financed the work of Michelangelo and other artists, beautified Rome
with new buildings, embellished the Vatican with the Sala Regia and the
Cappella Paolina, took part in brilliant receptions, welcomed fair women
to his table, received musicians, buffoons, female singers and dancers,
at his court; 10 even in his eighties this Farnese was no spoil-sport.
Titian transmitted him to us in a series of powerful portraits. The best
(in the Naples Museum) shows the seventy-five-year-old Pontiff still
strong, his face furrowed with problems of state and family, but his
head not yet bowed to time. Three years later Titian painted an almost
prophetic picture (also in Naples) of Paul and his nephews Ottavio and
Alessandro; the Pope, now bent and weary, seems to question Ottavio
suspiciously. In 1547 Paul’s son Pierluigi was assassinated:</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>9 22</p>

agreement with Paul’s enemies to make Parma an Imperial fief. The old
Pope, defeated</p>
<p>Julius III (1550-55) misnamed himself; there was nothing in him of
the virility and power and grandiose aims of Julius II; rather, he
resumed the easy ways of Leo X, and enjoyed the papacy with amiable
prodigality, as if the Reformation had died with Luther. He hunted, kept
court jesters, gambled for large sums, patronized bullfights, made a
cardinal out of a page who took care of his monkey, and, all in all,
gave Rome its last taste of Ren- aissance paganism in morals and art. 11
Outside the Porta del Popolo he had Vignola and others build for him the
pretty Villa di Papa Giulio (1553), and made it a center of artists,
poets, and festivities. He accommodated him- self peacefully to the
policies of Charles V. He suffered inopportunely from gout, and tried to
cure it by fasting; this papal epicurean seems to have died of
abstemiousness, 12 or, said others, 18 of dissipation.</p>
<p>Pope Marcellus II was almost a saint. His moral life was blameless,
his piety was profound, his appointments were exemplary, his efforts for
Church reform were sincere; but he died on the twenty-second day of his
pontificate (May 5, 1555).</p>
<p>As if to make clear that the Counter Reformation had reached the
papacy, the cardinals now raised to power the soul and voice of the
reform movement in the Church, the ascetic Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, who
took the name of Paul IV (1555-59). Already seventy-nine, he was
immovably fixed in his views, and dedicated himself to their
implementation with a firmness of will and an intensity of passion
hardly becoming a man of his years. “The Pope,” wrote the Florentine
ambassador, “is a man of iron, and th e very stones over which he walks
emit sparks.” 14 Born near Benevento, he carried the heat of southern
Italy in his blood, and fire seemed ever burning in his deep- sunken
eyes. His temper was volcanic, and only the Spanish ambassador, backed
by Alva’ s legions, dared to cross him. Paul IV hated Spain for having
mastered Italy; and as Julius II and Leo X had dreamed of expelling the
French, so the first goal of this energetic octogenarian was to liberate
Italy and the papacy from Spanish-Imperial domination. He denounced
Charles V as a secret atheist, 18 a lunatic son of a lunatic mother, a
“cripple in body and soul”; 16 he branded the Spanish people as Semitic
scum, 17 and vowed never to recognize Philip as Viceroy of Milan. In
December 1555, he con- cluded a treaty with Henry II of France and
Ercole II of Ferrara to drive all Spanish or Imperial forces from Italy.
If victorious, the papacy was to ac- quire Siena, the French were to get
Milan, and to hold Naples as a papal fief; and both Charles and
Ferdinand were to be deposed for having accepted the Protestant terms at
Augsburg. 18</p>
<p>By one of those comedies that can be seen, from a safe distance, in
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX ) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 923</p>
<p>ragedies of history, Philip II, the most zealous supporter of the
Church, found himself at war with the papacy. Reluctantly he ordered the
Duke of Alva to lead his Neapolitan army into the Papal States. In a few
weeks the Duke, with 10,000 seasoned troops, overwhelmed the weak forces
of the Pope, took town after town, sacked Anagni, seized Ostia, and
threatened Rome (November 1556). Paul sanctioned a treaty between France
and Turkey, and his secretary of state, Cardinal Carlo Caraffa, appealed
to Sulei- man to attack Naples and Sicily. 19 Henry II sent an army into
Italy under Francis, Duke of Guise; it recaptured Ostia, and the Pope
rejoiced; but the defeat of the French at Saint-Quentin compelled Guise
to rush back to France with his men, and Alva, unresisted, advanced to
the gates of Rome. The Romans moaned with terror, and wished their
reckless Pontiff in his grave. 20 Paul saw that further hostilities
might repeat the terrible Sack of Rome, and might even drive Spain to
secession from the Roman Church. On September 12, 1557, he signed a
peace with Alva, who offered lenient terms, apologized for his victory,
and kissed the foot of the conquered Pope. 21 All captured papal
territory was restored, but the Spanish domination of Naples, Milan, and
the papacy was confirmed. So complete was this victory of the state over
the Church that when Ferdinand took over the Imperial title from Charles
V (1558), he was crowned by the electors, and no representative of the
Pope was allowed any part in the ceremony. Thus ended the papal coro-
nation of the Holy Roman Emperors; Charlemagne at last won his argument
with Leo III.</p>
<p>Freed willy-nilly from the burdens of war, Paul IV gave the remainder
of his pontificate to the ecclesiastical and moral reforms already
recorded. He crowned them by tardily dismissing his licentious
secretary, Cardinal Carlo Caraffa, and banishing from Rome two other
nephews who had disgraced his pontificate. Nepotism, which for a century
had flourished there, was at last evicted from the Vatican.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CENSORSHIP AND INQUISITION</li>
</ol>
<p>It was under this iron Pope that censorship of publications reached
its greatest severity and scope, and the Inquisition became a terror
almost as inhuman in Rome as in Spain. Probably Paul IV felt that
censorship of liter- ature and suppression of heresy were unavoidable
duties of a Church which — in Protestant as well as Catholic opinion —
had been founded by the Son of God. For if the Church was divine, her
opponents must be agents of Satan, and against these devils perpetual
war was a religious obligation to an in- sulted God.</p>
<p>Censorship was almost as old as the Church herself. The Christians
of</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>X924</p>
<p>Ephesus, in the age of the Apostles, burned books of “curious arts”
to the alleged value of “50,000 pieces of silver,” 22 and the Council of
Ephesus (150) forbade the circulation of the uncanonical Acta Pauli. 23
At various times the popes ordered the burning of the Talmud or other
Jewish books. Wyclifite and later Protestant translations of the Bible
were forbidden, as containing anti-Catholic prefaces, notes, and
emendations. Printing height- ened the anxiety of the Church to keep her
members uncorrupted by false doctrines. The Fifth Council of the Lateran
(1516) ordered that henceforth no books should be printed without
ecclesiastical examination and consent. Secular authorities issued their
own prohibitions of unlicensed publications: the Venetian Senate in
1508, the Diet of Worms and the edicts of Charles V and Francis I in
1521, the Parlement of Paris in 1542; and in 1543 Charles extended the
ecclesiastical control of publications to Spanish America. The first
general index of condemned books was issued by the Sorbonne in 1544; the
first Italian list by the Inquisition in 1545.</p>
<p>In 1559 Paul IV published the first papal Index auctorum et librorum
prohibitorum. It named forty-eight heretical editions of the Bible, and
put sixty-one printers and publishers under the ban. 24 No book that had
been published since 1519 without bearing the names of the author and
the printer and the place and date of publication was to be read by any
Catholic; and hereafter no book was to be read that had not obtained an
ecclesiastical imprimatur — ’let it be printed.” Booksellers and
scholars complained that these measures would handicap or ruin them, but
Paul insisted on full obedi- ence. In Rome, Bologna, Naples, Milan,
Florence, and Venice thousands of books were burned — 10,000 in Venice
in a day. 25 After Paul’s death lead - ing churchmen criticized his
measures as too drastic and indiscriminate. The Council of Trent
rejected his Index, and issued a more orderly pro- scription, the
“Tridentine Index” of 1564. A special Congregation of the Index was
formed in 1571 to revise and republish the list periodically.</p>
<p>It is hard to judge the effect of this censorship. Paolo Sarpi,
ex-monk and anticlerical, thought the Index “the finest secret ever
discovered for… making men idiotic.” 26 It probably shared in causing
the intellectual decline of Italy after 1600, of Spain after 1700, but
economic and political factors were more important. Free thought,
according to its most virile English his- torian, survived better in
Catholic than in Protestant countries; the absolu- tism of the
Scriptures, enforced by Protestant divines, proved, till 1750, more
damaging to independent investigation and speculation than the In- dexes
and Inquisition of the Church. 27 In any case the humanist movement
faded out, in Catholic and Protestant countries alike. The accent on
life subsided in. literature; the study of Greek and the love of the
pagan classics declined; and the triumphant theologians denounced the
Italian humanists (not without reason) as arrogant and dissolute
infidels.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXIX) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 925</p>
<p>The censorship of books was laxly enforced until Paul IV entrusted it
to the Inquisition (1555). That institution, first established in 1217,
had lapsed in power and repute under the lenience of the Renaissance
popes. But when the final attempt at reconciliation with the Protestants
had failed at Ratisbon, and Protestant doctrines appeared in Italy
itself, even among the clergy, and entire towns like Lucca and Modena
threatened to go Protestant, 28 Cardinal Giovanni Caraffa, Ignatius
Loyola, and Charles V joined in urging the res- toration of the
Inquisition. Paul III yielded (1542), appointed Caraffa and five other
cardinals to reorganize the institution, and empowered them to delegate
their authority to specific ecclesiastics throughout Christendom.
Caraffa proceeded with his accustomed severity, set up headquarters and
a prison, and laid down rules for his subordinates:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When the faith is in question, there must be no delay, but on</li>
</ol>
<p>he slightest suspicion rigorous measures must be taken with all
speed.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>No consideration is to be shown to any prince or prelate, how-</li>
</ol>
<p>ever high his station.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Extreme severity is rather to be exercised against those who

</ol>
<p>empt to shield themselves under the protection of any potentate.</p>
<p>Only he who makes plenary confession should be treated with gentle-
ness and fatherly compassion.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>No man must debase himself by showing toleration toward</li>
</ol>
<p>heretics of any kind, above all toward Calvinists. 29</p>
<p>Paul III and Marcellus II restrained Caraffa’s ardor, and reserved
the right of pardon on appeal. Julius III was too lackadaisical to
interfere with Caraffa, and several heretics were burned in Rome during
his pontificate. In 1550 the new Inquisition ordered the trial of any
Catholic clergyman who did not preach against Protestantism. When
Caraffa himself became Paul IV, the institution was set in full motion,
and under his “superhuman rigor,” said Cardinal Seripando, “the
Inquisition acquired such a reputation that from no other judgment seat
on earth were more horrible and fearful sentences to be expected.” 30
The jurisdiction of the inquisitors was extended to cover blasphemy,
simony, sodomy, polygamy, rape, procuring, violation of the Church
regulations for fasting, and many other offenses that had nothing to do
with heresy. To quote again a great Catholic historian:</p>
<p>The hasty and credulous Pope lent a willing ear to every de-</p>
<p>nunciation, even the most absurd…. The inquisitors, constantly</p>
<p>urged on by the Pope, scented heresy in numerous cases where a</p>
<p>calm and circumspect observer would not have discovered a trace</p>
<p>of it.. ,. The envious and the calumniator were kept hard at work</p>
<p>snapping up suspicious words fallen from the lips of men who had</p>
<p>been firm pillars of the Church against the innovators, and in
bringing</p>
<p>926 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xgroundless accusations of heresy against them…. An actual reign</p>
<p>of terror began, which filled all Rome with fear. 81</p>
<p>At the height of this fury (May 31, 1557) Paul ordered the arrest
of</p>
<p>Cardinal Giovanni Morone, Bishop of Modena, and on June 14 he com-
manded Cardinal Pole to surrender his legatine power in England and come
to Rome to face trial for heresy; the College of Cardinals, said the
Pope, was itself infected with heresy. Pole was protected by Queen Mary,
who pre- vented the papal summons from being delivered to him. Morone
was charged with having signed the Ratisbon agreement on justification
by faith, with having been too lenient with heretics under his
jurisdiction, and with having been friendly with Pole, Vittoria Colonna,
Flaminio, and other dangerous characters. After eighteen days as a
prisoner in the Castel Sant’ Angelo, he was pronounced guiltless by the
inquisitors, and was ordered released, but he refused to leave his cell
until Paul acknowledged his innocence. Paul would not, and Morone
remained a prisoner until the Pope’s death freed him. Flaminio cheated
the Inquisition by dying, but, said Paul, “we have had his brother
Cesare burned in the piazza before the church of the Min- erva.” 82 With
impartial resolution the mad Pontiff pursued his own rel - atives with
suspicions of heresy. “Even if my own father were a heretic,” he said,
“I would gather the wood to burn him.” 83</p>
<p>Fortunately, Paul was mortal, and went to his reward after four years
of rule. Rome celebrated his death with four days of joyful rioting,
during which the crowd tore down his statue, dragged it through the
streets, sank it in the Tiber, burned the buildings of the Inquisition,
freed its prisoners, and destroyed its documents. 84 The Pope would have
retorted that only a man of his inflexible austerity and courage could
have reformed the morals of Rome and the abuses of the Church, and that
he had succeeded in that enterprise where his predecessors had failed.
It was a pity that in reforming the Church he had remembered Torquemada
and forgotten Christ.</p>
<p>All Western Europe was relieved when the conclave of 1559 chose</p>
<p>Giovanni Angelo de’ Medici to be Pope Pius IV. He was no Medici
million - aire, but the son of a Milanese taxgatherer. He practiced law
for a living, won the admiration and confidence of Paul III, was made a
cardinal, and gained a reputation for intelligence and benevolence. As
pontiff he kept clear of war, and reproved those who counseled
aggressive policies. He did not end the Inquisition, but he let the
inquisitors know that they “would better</p>
<p>chap.xxxix) the popes and the council 927</p>
<p>he Catholic bishops of Germany to administer the Eucharist in both
bread and wine. He reconvened the Council of Trent, and guided it to an
orderl * conclusion. In 1565, after a pontificate that had peaceably
consolidated the Counter Reformation, he passed away.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE COUNCIL OF TRENT: 1 545-63</li>
</ol>
<p>A thousand voices, long before Luther, had called for a council to
reform the Church. Luther appealed from the pope to a free and general
council; Charles V demanded such a synod in the hope of getting the
Protestant prob- lem off his hands, and perhaps of disciplining Clement
VII. That harried Pope could find a hundred reasons for postponing a
council until he should be beyond its reach. He recalled what had
happened to the papal power at the councils of Constance and Basel; and
he could not afford to have hostile bishops, or Imperial delegates, pry
into his policies, his domestic difficulties, or his birth. Besides, how
could a council help the situation? Had not Luther repudiated councils
as well as popes? If the Protestants were admitted to a council and were
allowed freedom of speech, the consequent dispute would widen and
embitter the schism and would disturb all Europe; and if they were
excluded they would raise a rebellious furor. Charles wanted the council
held on German soil, but Francis I refused to let the French clergy
attend a gathering subject to Imperial domination; moreover, Francis
wanted to keep the Protestant fires burning in the Imperial rear. It was
a witches’ brew.</p>
<p>Paul III had all of Clement’s fears, but more courage. In 1536 he
issued a call for a general council to meet at Mantua on May 23, 1537,
and he invited the Protestants to attend. He assumed that all parties in
attendance would accept the conclusions of the conference; but the
Protestants, who would be in a minority there, could hardly accept such
an obligation. Luther ad- vised against attending, and the congress of
Protestants at Schmalkalden re- turned the Pope’s invitation unopened.
The Emperor still insisted that the council should meet on German soil;
on Italian soil, he argued, it would be crowded with Italian bishops and
become a puppet of the Pope. After many negotiations and delays Paul
sgreed to have the council meet at Trent, which, though predominantly
Italian, was in Imperial territory and subject to Charles. The council
was summoned to meet there on November 1, 1 542.</p>
<p>But the King of France would not play. He forbade the publication, in
his realm, of the papal summons, and threatened to arrest any French
clergy- man who should try to attend a council held on his enemy’s
terrain. When the council opened, only a few bishops, all Italian, were
present, and Paul adjourned the meeting to some time when Charles and
Francis would allow</p>
<p>928 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xa full assembly. The Peace of Crepy seemed to clear the way, and
Paul called for the council to reconvene on March 14, 1545. But now the
renewal of danger from the Turks compelled the Emperor again to
conciliate the Protestants; he asked for another postponement; and it
was not till Decem- ber 13, 1545, that the “Nineteenth Ecumenical
Council of the Christian Church” began its active sessions at Trent.</p>
<p>Even that beginning was unpropitious, and far from “half the deed.”
The Pope, nearing eighty, stayed in Rome, and presided, so to speak, in
absentia; but he sent three cardinals to represent him — Del Monte,
Cervini, and Pole. Cardinal Madruzzo of Trent, four archbishops, twenty
bishops, five generals of monastic orders, some abbots, and a few
theologians made up the gathering; it could hardly claim as yet to be
“ecumenical”— universal. 86 Whereas at the councils of Constance and
Basel priests, princes, and certain laymen, as well as prelates, could
vote, and voting was by national groups, here only the cardinals,
bishops, generals, and abbots could vote, and the voting was by
individuals; hence the Italian bishops — most of them indebted or for
other reasons loyal to the papacy — dominated the assembly with their
numerical majority. “Congregations” sitting in Rome under the
supervision of the Pope prepared the issues which alone could be
submitted for debate. 87 Since the Council claimed to be guided by the
Holy Ghost, a French dele- gate remarked that the third person of the
Trinity regularly came to Trent in the courier’s bag from Rome. 88</p>
<p>The first debate was on procedure: should the faith be first defined
and then reforms considered, or vice versa? The Pope and his Italian
supporters desired first a definition of dogmas. The Emperor and his
supporters sought reform first: Charles in the hope of appeasing,
weakening, or further dividing the Protestants; the German and Spanish
prelates in the hope that reforms would reduce the power of the Pope
over the bishops and the councils. A compromise was reached: concurrent
commissions would prepare resolu- tions on dogma and reform, and these
would be presented to the Council alternately.</p>
<p>In May 1546, Paul sent two Jesuits, Laynez and Salmeron, to help his
legates in matters of theology and papal defense; later they were joined
by Peter Canisius and Claude Le Jay. The unequaled erudition of the
Jesuits soon gave them paramount influence in the debates, and their
unbending orthodoxy guided the Council to declare war against
Reformation ideas rather than seek conciliation or unity. It was
apparently the judgment of the majority that no concessions to the
Protestants would heal the schism; that Protestant sects were already so
numerous and diverse that no com- promise could satisfy some without
offending others; that any substantial alteration of traditional dogmas
would weaken the whole doctrinal structure and stability of Catholicism;
that the admission of priestly powers in the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX ) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 929</p>
<p>laity would undermine the moral authority of the priesthood and the
Church; that that authority was indispensable to social order; and that
a theology frankly founded on faith would stultify itself by submitting
to the vagaries of individual reasoning. Consequently the fourth session
of the Council (April 1546) reaffirmed every item of the Nicene Creed,
claimed equal au- thority for Church tradition and Scripture, gave the
Church the sole right to expound and interpret the Bible, and declared
the Latin Vulgate of Jerome to be the definitive translation and text.
Thomas Aquinas was named as the authoritative exponent of orthodox
theology, and his Surnma theologica was placed on an altar only below
the Bible and the Decretals. 39 Catholicism as a religion of infallible
authority dates in practice from the Council of Trent, and took form as
an uncompromising response to the challenge of Protestantism,
rationalism, and private judgment. The “Gentlemen’s Ag ree- ment” of the
Renaissance Church with the intellectual classes came to an end.</p>
<p>But if faith was so vital was it also sufficient of itself to merit
salvation, as Luther claimed? The fifth session (June 1546) heard
violent debates on this point; one bishop clutched another by the beard
and plucked out a handful of white hairs; hearing which, the Emperor
sent the Council word that if it could not quiet down he would have a
few prelates thrown into the Adige to cool them off. 40 Reginald Pole
argued for a view so dangerously close to Luther’s that Cardinal Caraffa
(the future Paul IV) branded him as a heretic; Pole retired from the
battle to Padua, and excused himself, on the ground of illness, from
continued attendance at the Council. 41 Cardinal Seripando defended the
compromise formula that Contarini, now dead, had offered at Ratisbon;
but Laynez persuaded the Council to stress, in full op- position to
Luther, the importance of good works and the freedom of the will.</p>
<p>Measures of ecclesiastical reform moved less actively than
definitions of dogma. The Bishop of St. Mark had opened the session of
January 6, 1546, by painting a somber picture of the corruption
prevailing in the world, which he thought posterity would never surpass,
and he had attributed this de- generation “solely to the wickedness of
the pastors”; the Lutheran heresy, he said, had been caused chiefly by
the sins of the clergy, and the reform of the clergy was the best way of
suppressing the rebellion. 42 But the only substantial reform
accomplished in these early sessions was one forbidding bishops to
reside away from their sees, or to hold more than one. The Coun- cil
suggested to the Pope that the reform of the Dataria should advance from
theoretical recommendations to actual directives. Paul, however, wished
matters of reform to be left to the papacy; and when the Emperor
insisted on greater speed in reform discussions at the conference, the
Pope ordered his legates to propose the removal of the Council to
Bologna — which, being</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>930</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>Xin the Papal States, would allow a more expeditious control of
conciliar actions by Rome. The Italian bishops agreed; the Spanish and
Imperial pre- lates protested; a minor plague conveniently appeared in
Trent and killed a bishop; the Italian majority moved to Bologna (March
1547); the rest stayed at Trent. Charles refused recognition to the
Bologna sessions, and threatened to convene a separate council in
Germany. After two years of argument and maneuvering Paul yielded, and
suspended the Bologna as- sembly (September 1 549).</p>
<p>The situation was eased by Paul’s death. J ulius III came to an
understand- ing with the Emperor: in return for Charles’s promise to
withhold support from any measure that would reduce papal authority, he
summoned the Council to meet again at Trent in May 1551, and agreed that
the Lutherans should be given a hearing. Henry II of France, resenting
this rapprochement between Pope and Emperor, declined to recognize the
Council. When it met it was so meagerly attended that it had to adjourn.
It assembled again on September 1, with eight archbishops, thirty-six
bishops, three abbots, five generals, forty-eight theologians, Elector
Joachim II of Brandenburg, and ambassadors from Charles and
Ferdinand.</p>
<p>The thirteenth session of the Council (October 1551) reaffirmed the
Cath- olic doctrine of transubstantiation: the priest, in consecrating
the bread and wine of the Eucharist, actually changes each of them into
the body and blood of Christ. Thereafter it seemed useless to hear the
Protestants, but Charles insisted on it. The Duke of Wurttemberg,
Elector Maurice of Saxony, and some south German towns chose the members
of a Protestant delegation, and Melanchthon drew up a statement of
Lutheran doctrine to be sub- mitted to the Council. Charles gave the
delegates a safe-conduct, but these, remembering Constance and Huss,
required also a safe-conduct from the Council itself. After much
discussion this was granted. However, a Domin- ican friar, preaching on
the parable of tares, in the very cathedral in which the sessions were
held, pointed out that the heretic tares might be endured for a time,
but in the end they would have to be burned. 48</p>
<p>On January 24, 1 552, the Protestant deputies addressed the assembly.
They proposed that the decrees of the Councils of Constance and Basel on
the superior authority of councils over the popes should be confirmed;
that the members of the present body should be released from their vows
of fealty to Julius III; that all decisions hitherto reached by the
Council should be annulled; and that fresh discussions of the issues
should be held by an en- larged synod in which the Protestants would be
adequately represented. 44 Julius III forbade consideration of these
proposals. The Council voted to postpone action on them till March 19,
when additional Protestant dele- gates were expected.</p>
<p>During this delay military developments supervened upon theology.
In</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX ) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 93 1</p>
<p>January 1552, the King of France signed an alliance with the German
Protes- tants; in March Maurice of Saxony advanced toward Innsbruck;
Charles fled, and no force could prevent Maurice, if he wished, from
capturing Trent and swallowing the Council. The bishops one by one
disappeared, and on April 28 the Council was formally suspended. By the
treaty of Passau (August 2) Ferdinand conceded religious freedom to the
militantly vic- torious Protestants. They took no further interest in
the Council.</p>
<p>Paul IV thought it prudent to let the Council hibernate during his
pon- tificate. Pius IV, a kindly old man, played with the thought that
the granting of communion in both kinds might appease the Protestants,
as it had done the Bohemians. He summoned the Council to reconvene at
Trent on April 6, 1561, and invited to it all Christian princes,
Catholic or Protestant. To this new session the French delegates brought
an imposing list of the reforms they desired: Mass in the vernacular,
communion in bread and wine, the marriage of priests, the subordination
of the papacy to general councils, and an end to the system of papal
dispensations and exemptions; 45 apparently the French government was
for the moment in a semi-Huguenot mood. Ferdi- nand I, now Emperor,
seconded these proposals, and added t hat “the Pope… should humble
himself, and submit to a reform in his own person, his state, and the
Curia”; the legends of the saints should be purified of absurdi - ties,
and monasteries should be reformed so “that their great wealth might no
longe r be expended in so profligate a manner.” 48 Matters loomed
perilous for Pius, and his legates looked with some trepidation to the
opening of the session.</p>
<p>After leisurely or strategic delays the seventeenth session of the
Council convened on January 18, 1562, with five cardinals, three
patriarchs, eleven archbishops, ninety bishops, four generals, four
abbots, and sundry lay rep- resentatives of Catholic princes. At
Ferdinand’s request a safe -conduct was offered to any Protestant
delegate who might care to attend; none came. The Archbishop of Granada
and Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, led a move- ment to reduce the
prerogatives of the pope by asserting that the bishops held their power
not through him b ut by direct “divine right”; and the Bishop of Segovia
repeated one of Luther’s heresies by denying that the pope was supreme
over the other bishops in the early Church. 47 This episco- pal uprising
was snuffed out by the parliamentary skill of the papal legates, the
loyalty of the Italian and Polish bishops to the Pope, and some timely
papal courtesies to the Cardinal of Lorraine. In the end the papal
authority was not lessened but enlarged, and every bishop was required
to take an oath of complete obedience to the Pope. Ferdinand was
appeased by the promise that on the termination of the Council the Pope
would allow administration of the Eucharist in both kinds.</p>
<p>This basic quarrel over, the Council quickly dispatched its remaining
busi-</p>
<p>932 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xness. Clerical marriage was forbidden, and severe penalties were
decreed against priestly concubinage. Many minor reforms were enacted to
improve the morals and discipline of the clergy. Seminaries were to be
established where candidates for the priesthood could be trained to
habits of austerity and piety. The powers of the Curia were curbed.
Rules were laid down foi the reform of Church music and art; nude
figures were to be sufficiently covered to avoid stimulating the sensual
imagination. A distinction was drawn between the worship of images and
the worship of the persons rep- resented by them; in the latter sense
the use of religious images was upheld. Purgatory, indulgences, and the
invocation of the saints were defended and redefined. Here the Council
frankly recognized the abuses that had sparked Luther’s rebellion; one
decree read:</p>
<p>In granting indulgences the Council… decrees that all criminal</p>
<p>gain therewith connected shall be entirely done away with, as a</p>
<p>source of grievous abuse among the Christian people; and as to other
disorders arising from superstitution, ignorance, irreverence, or any
cause whatsoever — since these, on account of the widespread corrup-
tion, cannot be removed by special prohibitions — the Council lays</p>
<p>upon each bishop the duty of finding out such abuses as exist in
his</p>
<p>own diocese, of bringing them before the next provincial synod, and
of reporting them, with the assent of the other bishops, to the Roman
Pontiff. 48</p>
<p>Pope and Emperor agreed that the Council had now reached an end of
its usefulness; and on December 4, 1563, it was finally dissolved amid
the happy acclamations of the wearied delegates. The course of the
Church had been fixed for centuries.</p>
<p>The Counter Reformation succeeded in its principal purposes. Men con-
tinued, in Catholic as much as in Protestant countries, to lie and
steal, seduce maidens and sell offices, kill and make war. 49 But the
morals of the clergy improved, and the wild freedom of Renaissance Italy
was tamed to a decent conformity with the pretensions of mankind.
Prostitution, which had been a major industry in Renaissance Rome and
Venice, now hid its head, and chastity became fashionable. The
authorship or publication of obscene works was made a capital offense in
Italy; so Niccolo Franco, secretary and enemy of Aretino, was hanged by
order of Pius V for his Priapeia. 50 The effect of the new restrictions
on art and literature was not indisputably harmful; baroque art is
emerging timidly from disrepute; and from a purely literary standpoint
Tasso, Guarini, and Goldoni do not fall precipitately from the level of
Boiardo, Ariosto, and the dramatist Machiavel li. Spain’s greatest age
in literature and art came in the fullness of the “Catholic Reaction.“
But the joyous character of Renaissance Italy faded; Italian women lost
some</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX) THE POPES AND THE COUNCIL 933</p>
<p>of the charm and exhilaration that had come from their
pre-Reformation freedom; a somber and conscious morality produced an
almost puritan age in Italy. Monasticism revived. From the point of view
of the free mind it was a loss to mankind that the comparative
Renaissance liberty of thought was ended by ecclesiastical and political
censorship; and it was a tragedy that the Inquisition was restored in
Italy and elsewhere just when science was breaking through its medieval
shell. The Church deliberately sacrificed the intellectual classes to
the pious majority, which applauded the suppres- sion of ideas that
might dissolve its consoling faith.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical reforms were real and permanent. Though the papal
monarchy was exalted as against the episcopal aristocracy of the
councils, this was in the spirit of the times, when aristocracies
everywhere, except in Germany, were losing power to the kings. The popes
were now morally superior to the bishops, and the discipline required
for ecclesiastical reform could be better effected by a centralized than
by a divided authority. The popes ended their nepotism, and cured the
Curia of its costly procrastinations and flagrant venality. The
administration of the Church, according to non- Catholic students of the
matter, became a model of efficiency and integ- rity. 61 The dark
confessional box was introduced (1547) and made</p>
<p>obligatory (1614); the priest was no longer tempted by the occasional
beauty of his penitents. Indulgence peddlers disappeared; indulgences,
for the most part, were reserved for pious devotions and works of
charity rather than for financial contributions. Instead of retreating
before the advance of Protestantism or free thought, the Catholic clergy
set out to recapture the mind of youth and the allegiance of power. The
spirit of the Jesuits, con- fident, positive, energetic, and
disciplined, became the spirit of the militant Church.</p>
<p>All in all it was an astonishing recovery, one of the most brilliant
products of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>RENAISSANCE, REFORMATION, AND ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p>T HE Renaissance and the Reformation are the two springs of modern
history, rival sources of the intellectual and moral freshening of mod-
ern life. Men might be divided by their preference and lineage here, by
their conscious debt to the Renaissance for liberating the mind and
beautifying life, or their gratitude to the Reformation for quickening
religious belief and the moral sense. The debate between Erasmus and
Luther goes on, and will, for in these large matters such truth as men
can attain is begotten by the union of opposites, and will ever feel its
double parentage.</p>
<p>In a sense the debate is ethnic and geographical, between the Latins
and the Teutons, the plein-air, sensuous South and the misty, hardy
North; be- tween peoples conquered by Rome and receiving the classic
heritage, and peoples resisting Rome — some conquering Rome — and loving
their own roots and climes far more than Greeks bringing gifts or Romans
bearing laws. Italy and Germany divided between them the forming of the
modern soul: Italy by going back to classic literature, philosophy, and
art, Germany by going back to early Christian faith and ritual. Italy
was almost succeeding in its second effort to conquer Germany — now
through tithes and humanism; Germany resisted again, expelled the
Church, and silenced the humanists. The Reformation repudiated the
Renaissance and its emphasis on earthly affairs and joys, and returned
to that aspect (only one! ) of the Middle Ages which counted human
achievements and delights trivial and vain, called life a vale of tears,
and summoned sinful man to faith, repentance, and prayer. To the Italian
of the Renaissance, reading Machiavelli and Aretino, this seemed a
medieval reaction, a restoration of the Age of Faith in the struggling
adolescence of the Age of Reason. The Italian who had heard Pomponazzi,
and lived under the easy rule of the Renaissance popes, smiled to find
Luther and Calvin and Henry VIII keeping all the marvelous dogmas of the
medieval creed — a God-dictated Bible, a triune deity, predestination,
creation by divine fiat, original sin, incarnation, virgin birth,
atonement, the last judgment, heaven, and hell — and rejecting precisely
those elements of medieval Christianity — the worship of the Virgin, a
God of love and mercy, the invocation of intercessory saints, a ritual
adorned with all the arts — which had given to that faith a tenderness,
solace, and beauty warrant- ing a wink at the myths that allowed
enjoyment of the arts.</p>
<p>935</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>936</p>
<p>The sincerely believing Catholic had his own argument against the
Ref- ormation. He too resented tithes, but he could not dream of
destroying the Church. He knew quite well that the monks were getting
out of hand, but he felt that there should be room and institutions in
the world for men dedicated to contemplation, study, and prayer. He
accepted every word of the Bible with two provisos: that the law of
Christ had abrogated the law of Moses, and that the Church, having been
founded by the Son of God, had equal authority with the Bible, and
should have the final right to inter- pret it and adjust it to the
changing needs of life. What would happen if ambiguous and apparently
contradictory passages in Scripture were left to the free interpretation
and judgment of the individual man? — would not the Bible be torn to
pieces by a thousand minds, and Christianity be shattered into a
thousand warring sects?</p>
<p>The modern Catholic continues the argument through every phase of
modern life. “Your emphasis on faith as against works was ruinous, and
led to a religion whose coldness of heart was concealed behind the piety
of its phrases; for a hundred years charity almost died in the centers
of your vic- tory. You ended the confessional and generated a thousand
tensions in the soul of men struggling between instinct and
civilization, and now you be- latedly restore that healing institution
under dubious forms. You destroyed nearly all the schools we had
established, and you weakened to the verge of death the universities
that the Church had created and developed. Your own leaders admit that
your disruption of the faith led to a dangerous deterio- ration of
morals in both Germany and England. You let loose a chaos of
individualism in morals, philosophy, industry, and government. You took
all the joy and beauty out of religion, and filled it with demonology
and terror; you condemned the masses of mankind to damnation as
“reprobates,” and consoled an insolent few with the pride of “election”
and salvation. You stifled the growth of art, and wherever you triumphed
classical studies withered. You expropriated Church property to give it
to the state and the rich, but you left the poor poorer than before, and
added contempt to misery. You condoned usury and capitalism, but you
deprived the workers of the restful holydays a merciful Church had given
them. You rejected the papacy only to exalt the state; you gave to
selfish princes the right to determine the religion of their subjects,
and to use religion as a sanction for their wars. You divided nation
against nation, and many a nation and city against it- self; you wrecked
the international moral checks on national powers, and created a chaos
of warring national states. You denied the authority of a Church
founded, on your own admission, by the Son of God, but you sanctioned
absolute monarchy, and exalted the divine right of kings. Un- wittingly
you destroyed the power of the Word, which is the only alter-</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>937</p>
<p>native to the power of money or the sword. You claimed the right of
private judgment, but you denied it to others as soon as you could; and
your re- fusal to tolerate dissent was less understandable than ours,
for we had never defended toleration; no man can be tolerant except
where he is indifferent. Meanwhile see what your private judgment has
led to. Every man becomes a pope, and judges the doctrines of religion
before he is old enough to comprehend the functions of religion in
society and morals, and the need of the people for a religious faith. A
kind of disintegrative mania, unhin- dered by any integrative authority,
throws your followers into such absurd and violent disputes that men
begin to doubt all religion, and Christianity itself would be dissolved,
and men would be left spiritually naked in the face of death, were it
not that the Church stands firm amid all the fluctuations of opinion and
argument, all the fashions of science and philosophy, and holds her
regathering flock together against the time when those of you who have
come to understand, and are really Christians, will submit your pride of
individuality and intellect to the religious needs of mankind, and will
come back to the one fold that can preserve religion despite the blas-
phemous ideologies of this unhappy age.”</p>
<p>Can the Protestant answer this indictment? “Let us not forget the
cause of our divergence. Your Catholic Church had become corrupt in
practice and personnel, your priests were not functioning, your bishops
were world- lings, your popes were the scandal of Christendom; do not
your own his- torians confess it? Honest men called upon you to reform,
and meanwhile kept their loyalty to the Church; you promised and
pretended to reform, but you did not; on the contrary, you burned at the
stake men like Huss and Jerome of Prague because they cried out for
reform. A thousand efforts were made to reform the Church from within;
they failed until our Ref- ormation forced you to act; and even after
our revolt the pope who tried to cleanse the Church became the
laughingstock of Rome.</p>
<p>“You pride yourself on producing the Renaissance, but everyone agrees
that the Renaissance was issuing in such immorality, violence, and
treachery as Europe had not known since Nero; were we not right in
protesting against this paganism, flaunting itself even in the Vatican?
Granted that morals declined for a while after our Reformation began; it
took time to rebuild a moral life whose religious foundations and
ministrations had decayed; ultimately the morality of Protestant lands
became far superior to that of Catholic France and Italy. We may owe our
mental awakening to the Ren- aissance, but we owe our moral recovery to
the Reformation; to the liber- ation of the intellect was added the
strengthening of character. Your Renaissance was for the aristocracy and
the intellectuals; it scorned the people, and winked at their
hoodwinking by indulgence peddlers and monk-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>938</p>
<p>ish profiteers on mythology; was it not good that this crass
financial exploita- tion of human hopes and fears should be challenged?
We rejected the paintings and statues with which you had littered your
churches, because you were allowing the people to worship the images
themselves, as when you re- quired them to fall on their knees before
the sacred dolls carried in procession through the streets. We dared to
base our religion on a strong and active faith, rather than try to drug
the mind of the people with liturgy.</p>
<p>“We acknowledged the secular authority as divine— as your own theolo-
gians had done before us — because social order requires a respected
govern- ment. We rejected the international authority of the popes only
after they had flagrantly used it not to arbitrate justice among nations
but to advance their own material interests. The inability of your
self-seeking popes to unify Europe for a crusade against the Turks shows
that the dishonesty of the papacy had broken the unity of Christendom
long before the Reformation. And though we supported the divine right of
kings, we also, in England, Scotland, Switzerland, and America, favored
the development of democracy, while your priests in France, Italy, and
Spain were truckling to kings; and our rebellion against the authority
of your Church broke the spell of despotism, and prepared Europe to
question all absolutisms, religious or secular. You think we made the
poor poorer. But that too was a passing phase; the same capitalism that
for a while exploited poverty learned to en- rich the average man as
never before; and the standard of living is surely higher in Protestant
England, Germany, and America than in Catholic Italy, Spain, and
France.</p>
<p>“If you are stronger today than yesterday, it is because of us. What
but the Reformation compelled you to reform the Curia, to redeem your
clergy from concubinage, to seat men of religion, instead of pagans, in
the papal chair? To whom do you owe it that your clergy today have so
high a repute for integrity? To the Council of Trent? But to what did
you owe the Coun- cil of Trent, if not to the Reformation? Without that
check your Church might have continued its degeneration from
Christianity into paganism until your popes would have been enthroned
over an agnostic and epicurean world. Even with the regeneration which
we forced upon your Church, the peoples that accept your creed are more
negligent of religion, more skeptical of Christianity, than those that
adopted the Reformation; compare France with England.</p>
<p>“We have learned to reconcile our piety with the freedom of the mind;
and it is our Protestant lands that have seen the greatest flowering of
science and philosophy. We hope to adjust our Christianity to the
progress of knowl- edge — but how is this possible to a Church that
rejects all the science of the last four centuries?”</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>939</p>
<p>Here the humanist enters the argument, and brings both houses down
upon his head. “This is the honor and weakness of Protestantism, that it
ap - peals to the intellect, which is always changing; and the strength
of Catho- licism lies in its refusal to adjust itself to the theories of
science, which, in the experience of history, seldom survive the century
in which they were born. Catholicism proposes to meet the religious
demands of the people, who have barely heard of Copernicus and Darwin,
and have never heard of Spinoza and Kant; such people are many and
fertile. But how can a religion that speaks to the intellect, and
centers around the sermon, adjust itself to an expanding universe in
which the planet that claimed to have received God’s Son has become a
transitory speck in space, and the species for which He died is but a
moment in the phantasmagoria of life? What happens to Protes- tantism
when the Bible that it took as its sole and infallible basis is
subjected to a Higher Criticism that turns it from the word of God into
the literature of the Hebrews and the transformation of Christ in the
mystical theology of Paul?</p>
<p>“The real problem for the modem mind is not between Catholicism and
Protestantism, nor between the Reformation and the Renaissance; it is
be- tween Christianity and the Enlightenment — that hardly datable era
which began in Europe with Francis Bacon, and hitched its hopes to
reason, science, and philosophy. As art was the keynote of the
Renaissance, and religion the soul of the Reformation, so science and
philosophy became the gods of the Enlightenment. From this standpoint
the Renaissance was in the direct line of European mental development,
and led to the Illumination and Auf- kldrung; the Reformation was a
deviation from that line, a rejection of reason, a reaffirmation of
medieval faith.</p>
<p>“And yet, despite its original intolerance, the Reformation rendered
two services to the Enlightenment: it broke the authority of dogma,
generated a hundred sects that would formerly have died at the stake,
and allowed among them such virile debate that reason was finally
recognized as the bar before which all sects had to plead their cause
unless they were armed with irresistible physical force. In that
pleading, that attack and defense, all sects were weakened, all dogmas;
and a century after Luther’s exaltation</p>
<p>940 THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>drama of the last three hundred years. What are the struggles of
states and classes beside that Armageddon of the soul?”</p>
<p>And now, as we look back over the meandering narrative of these thou-
sand pages, we perceive that our sympathy can go to all the combatants.
We can understand the anger of Luther at Roman corruption and dominance,
the reluctance of German princes to see German collections fatten Italy,
the resolve of Calvin and Knox to build model moral communities, the
desire of Henry VIII for an heir, and for authority in his own realm.
But we can understand, too, the hopes of Erasmus for a reform that would
not poison Christendom with hatred; and we can feel the dismay of devout
Roman pre- lates like Contarini at the prospective dismemberment of a
Church that for centuries had been the nurse and custodian of Western
civilization, and was still the strongest bulwark against immorality,
chaos, and despair.</p>
<p>Nothing of all these efforts was lost. The individual succumbs, but
he does not die if he has left something to mankind. Protestantism, in
time, helped to regenerate the moral life of Europe, and the Church
purified her- self into an organization politically weaker but morally
stronger than be- fore. One lesson emerges above the smoke of the
battle: a religion is at its best when it must live with competition; it
tends to intolerance when and where it is unchallenged and supreme. The
greatest gift of the Reformation was to provide Europe and America with
that competition of faiths which puts each on its mettle, cautions it to
tolerance, and gives to our frail minds the zest and test of
freedom.</p>
