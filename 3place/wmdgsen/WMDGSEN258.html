<h4 id="chapter-iii-the-rise-of-the-medici">CHAPTER III The Rise of the
Medici</h4>
<p>i 378- i 464</p>
<p>I. THE SETTING</p>
<p>T HE Italians called this coming of age la Rinascita, Rebirth,
because to them it seemed a triumphant resurrection of the classic
spirit after a barbarous interruption of a thousand years.* The classic
world, the Italians felt, had died in the German and Hun invasions of
the third, fourth, and fifth centuries; the heavy hand of the Goth had
crushed the fading but still fair flower of Roman art and life; “Gothic”
art had repeated the in - vasion with an architecture precariously
unstable and decoratively bizarre, and a sculpture coarse, crude, and
gloomy with dour prophets and emaci- ated saints. Now, by the grace of
time, those bearded Goths and those “long - beard” Lombards had been
absorbed into the dominant Italian blood; by the grace of Vitruvius and
the instructive ruins of the Roman Forum the classic column and
architrave would again build shrines and palaces of sober dignity; by
the grace of Petrarch and a hundred Italian scholars the rediscovered
classics would restore the literature of Italy to the pure idiom and
precision of Cicero’s prose, and the mellow music of Virgil’s verse. The
sunshine of the Italian spirit would break through the northern mists;
men and women would escape from the prison of medieval fear; they would
worship beauty in all its forms, and fill the air with the joy of</p>
<p>resurrection. Italy would be young again.</p>
<p>The men who spoke so were too near the event to see the “Rebirth” in
historical perspective, or in the confusing diversity of its
constituents. But it took more than a revival of antiquity to make the
Renaissance. And first of all it took money — smelly bourgeois money:
the profits of skillful man- agers and underpaid labor; of hazardous
voyages to the East, and laborious crossings of the Alps, to buy goods
cheap and sell them dear; of careful calculations, investments, and
loans; of interest and dividends accumulated</p>
<p>Vasari, in his Vite de ’ piti eccelenti architetti , pittori , e
scultori ltaliani (1550), estab - lished the term Rinascita , and the
French Encyclopedic of 1751-72 first definitely used the word
Renaissance , to denote the flowering of letters and arts in the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p>until enough surplus could be spared from the pleasures of the flesh,
from the purchase of senates, signories, and mistresses, to pay a
Michelangelo or a Titian to transmute wealth into beauty, and perfume a
fortune with the breath of art. Money is the root of all civilization.
The funds of mer-</p>
<p>chants, bankers, and the Church paid for the manuscripts that revived
antiquity. Nor was it those manuscripts which freed the mind and senses
of the Renaissance; it was the secularism that came from the rise of the
middle classes; it was the growth of the universities, of knowledge and
philosophy, the realistic sharpening of minds by the study of law, the
broadening of minds by wider acquaintance with the world. Doubting the
dogmas of the Church, no longer frightened by the fear of hell, and
seeing the clergy as epicurean as the laity, the educated Italian shook
him- self loose from intellectual and ethical restraints; his liberated
senses took unabashed delight in all embodiments of beauty in woman,
man, and art; and his new freedom made him creative for an amazing
century ( 1434-</p>
<ol start="1534" type="1">
<li>before it destroyed him with moral chaos, disintegrative individual-
ism, and national slavery. The interlude between two disciplines was the
Renaissance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why was northern Italy the first to experience this spring awakening?
There the old Roman world had never been quite destroyed; the towns had
kept their ancient structure and memories, and now renewed their Roman
law. Classic art survived in Rome, Verona, Mantua, Padua; Agrippa’s</p>
<p>Pantheon still functioned as a place of worship, though it was
fourteen hundred years old; and in the Forum one could almost hear
Cicero and Caesar debating the fate of Catiline. The Latin language was
still a living tongue, of which Italian was merely a melodious variant.
Pagan deities, myths, and rites lingered in popular memory, or under
Christian forms. Italy stood athwart the Mediterranean, commanding that
basin of classic civilization and trade. Northern Italy was more urban
and industrial than any other region of Europe except Flanders. It had
never suffered a full feudalism, but had subjected its nobles to its
cities and its merchant class. It was the avenue of trade between the
rest of Italy and transalpine Europe, and between Western Europe and the
Levant; its commerce and industry made it the richest region in
Christendom. Its adventurous traders were everywhere, from the fairs of
France to the farthest ports of the Black Sea. Accustomed to dealing
with Greeks, Arabs, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, Hindus, and Chinese, they
lost the edge of their dogmas, and brought into the literate classes of
Italy that same indifference to creeds which in nine-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 69</p>
<p>eenth-century Europe came from widening contacts with alien faiths.
Mercantile wisdom, however, conspired with national traditions, tempera-
ment, and pride to keep Italy Catholic even while she became pagan.
Papal fees trickled to Rome along a thousand rivulets from a score of
Christian lands, and the wealth of the Curia overflowed throughout
Italy. The Church rewarded Italian loyalty with a generous lenience to
the sins of the flesh, and a genial tolerance (before the Council of
Trent, 1 545) of heretical philosophers who refrained from undermining
the piety of the people. So Italy advanced, in wealth and art and
thought, a century ahead of the rest of Europe; and it was only in the
sixteenth century, when the Renaissance faded in Italy, that it
blossomed in France, Germany, Holland, England, and Spain. The
Renaissance was not a period in time but a mode of life and thought
moving from Italy through Europe with the course of com- merce, war, and
ideas.</p>
<p>It made its first home in Florence for much the same reasons that
gave it birth in northern Italy. Through the organization of her
industry, the ex- tension of her commerce, and the operations of her
financiers, Fiorenza — the City of Flowers — was in the fourteenth
century the richest town in the peninsula, excepting Venice. But while
the Venetians in that age gave their energies almost entirely to the
pursuit of pleasure and wealth, the Florentines, possibly through the
stimulus of a turbulent semidemocracy, developed a keenness of mind and
wit, and a skill in every art, that made their city by common consent
the cultural capital of Italy. The quarrels of the factions raised the
temperature of life and thought, and rival families contended in the
patronage of art as well as in the pursuit of power. The final — not the
first — stimulus was given when Cosimo de’ Medici offered the resources
of his own and other fortunes and palaces to house and en- tertain the
delegates to the Council of Florence (1439). The Greek</p>
<p>prelates and scholars who came to that assembly to discuss the
reunion of Eastern and Western Christianity had a far better knowledge
of Greek literature than any Florentine could then possess; some of them
lectured in Florence, and the elite of the city crowded to hear them.
When Con- stantinople fell to the Turks many Greeks left it to make
their home in the city where they had found such hospitality fourteen
years before. Several of them brought manuscripts of ancient texts; some
of them lectured on the Greek language or on Greek poetry and
philosophy. So, by the</p>
<p>concourse of many streams of influence, the Renaissance took form in
Florence, and made it the Athens of Italy.</p>
<p>?o</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MATERIAL BASIS</li>
</ol>
<p>Florence, in the fifteenth century, was a city-state ruling not
only</p>
<p>Florence but (with interruptions) Prato, Pistoia, Pisa, Volterra,
Cortona, Arezzo, and their agricultural hinterland. The peasants were
not serfs but partly small proprietors, mostly tenant farmers, who lived
in houses of crude cemented stone much as today, and chose their own
village officials to govern them in local affairs. Machiavelli did not
disdain to chat and play with these hardy knights of the field, the
orchard, or the vine. But the magistrates of the cities regulated sales,
and, to appease a troublesome proletariat, kept food prices too low for
peasant happiness; so the ancient strife of country and city added its
somber obbligato to the songs of hate that rose from embattled classes
within the city walls.</p>
<p>According to Villani the city of Florence proper had in 1 343 a
popula- tion of some 91,500 souls; we have no equally reliable estimate
for later Renaissance years, but we may presume that the population grew
as com- merce expanded and industry thrived. About a fourth of the city
dwellers were industrial workers; the textile lines alone, in the
thirteenth century, employed 30,000 men and women in two hundred
factories. 1 In 1300 Federigo Oricellarii earned his surname by bringing
from the East the secret of extracting from lichens a violet pigment (
orcloella , archil). This technique revolutionized the dye industry, and
made some woolen manu- facturers into what today would be millionaires.
In textiles Florence had already reached by 1300 the capitalistic stage
of large investment, central provision of materials and machinery,
systematic division of labor, and control of production by the suppliers
of capital. In 1407 a woolen garment passed through thirty processes,
each performed by a worker specializing in that operation. 2</p>
<p>To sell its products Florence encouraged its merchants to maintain
trade with all ports of the Mediterranean, and along the Atlantic as far
as Bruges. Consuls were stationed in Italy, the Baleares, Flanders,
Egypt, Cyprus, Constantinople, Persia, India, and China to protect and
promote Florentine trade. Pisa was conquered as an indispensable outlet
of Florentine goods to the sea, and Genoese merchant vessels were hired
to carry them. Foreign products competitive with Florentine manufactures
were excluded from the markets of Florence through protective tariffs
set by a government of merchants and financiers.</p>
<p>To finance this industry and commerce, and much else, the eighty
bank- ing houses of Florence — chiefly the Bardi, Peruzzi, Strozzi,
Pitti, and Medici</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 71</p>
<p>— invested the savings of their depositors. They cashed checks (
polizze ), 3 issued letters of credit ( lettere di pagamenti) , 4
exchanged merchandise as well as credit, 5 and supplied governments with
funds for peace or war. Some Florentine firms lent 1,365,000 florins
(4,125,000?) to Edward III of England, 6 and were ruined by his default
( 1 345 ). Despite such catastro- phes Florence became the financial
capital of Europe from the thirteenth through the fifteenth century; it
was there that rates of exchange were fixed for the currencies of
Europe. 7 As early as 1 300 a system of insurance protected the cargoes
of Italy on their voyages — a precaution not adopted in England till
1543. 8 Double-entry bookkeeping appears in a Florentine account book of
1382; probably it was already a century old in Florence, Venice, and
Genoa. 0 In 1345 the Florentine government issued negotiable
gold-redeemable bonds bearing the low interest rate of five per cent — a
proof of the city’s reputation for commercial prosperity and integrity.
The revenue of the government in 1400 was greater than that of England
in the heyday of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The bankers, merchants, manufacturers, professional men, and skilled
workers of Europe were organized in guilds. In Florence seven guilds
(arti, arts, trades) were known as arti maggiori or greater guilds:
clothing manufacturers, wool manufacturers, silk goods manufacturers,
fur mer- chants, financiers, physicians and druggists, and a mixed guild
of mer- chants, judges, and notaries. The remaining fourteen guilds of
Florence were the arti minori or minor trades: clothiers, hosiers,
butchers, bakers, vintners, cobblers, saddlers, armorers, blacksmiths,
locksmiths, carpenters, innkeepers, masons and stonecutters, and a
motley conglomeration of oil sellers, pork butchers, and ropemakers.
Every voter had to be a member of one or another of these guilds; and
the nobles who had been disfran- chised in 1282 by a bourgeois
revolution joined the guilds to regain the vote. Below the twenty-one
guilds were seventy-two unions of voteless workingmen; below these,
thousands of day laborers forbidden to organize, and living in impotent
poverty; below these — or above them as better cared for by their
masters — were a few slaves. The members of the greater guilds
constituted in politics the popolo grasso, the fat or well-fed people;
the rest of the population composed the popolo minuto or little people.
The po- litical history of Florence, like that of modern states, was
first the victory of the business class over the old landowning
aristocracy (1293), and then the struggle of the “working class” to
acquire political power.</p>
<p>In 1 345 Cinto Brandini and nine others were put to death for
organizing the poorer workers in the woolen industry, and foreign
laborers were im-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>ported to break up these unions. 10 In 1368 the “little people”
attempted a revolution but were suppressed. Ten years later the tumulto
dei Ciompi — the revolt of the wool carders — brought the working
classes for a dizzy moment into control of the commune. Led by a
barefoot workingman, Michele di Lando, the carders surged into the
Palazzo Vecchio, dispersed the Signory, and established a dictatorship
of the proletariat (1378). The laws against unionization were repealed,
the lower unions were enfran- chised, a moratorium of twelve years was
declared on the debts of wage earners, and interest rates were reduced
to further ease the burdens of the debtor class. Business leaders
retaliated by shutting down their shops and ind ucing the landowners to
cut the city’s food supply. The harassed revo - lutionists split into
factions — an aristocracy of labor consisting of skilled craftsmen, and
a “left wing” moved with communistic ideas. Finally the conservatives
brought in strong men from the countryside, armed them, overthrew the
divided government, and restored the business class to power</p>
<p>(1382)-</p>
<p>The triumphant bourgeoisie revised the constitution to consolidate
its victory. The Signoria, or municipal council of signori or gentlemen,
was composed of eight priori delle arti — priors or leaders of the
guilds — chosen by lot from bags containing the names of those eligible
for office. They in turn chose as their executive head a gonfaloniere di
giustizia —z “standard - bearer of justice” or executor of the law. Of
the eight priors four had to be from the greater guilds, though these
arti maggiori included but a small minority of the adult male
population. The same proportion was required in the advisory Consiglio
del Popolo or Council of the People; popolo, however, meant only the
members of the twenty-one guilds. The Consiglio del Comune was chosen
from any guild membership, but its function was confined to assembling
when summoned by the Signory, and to voting yes or no on proposals put
before it by the priors. On rare occasions the priors called a
parlamento of all voters to the Piazza della Signoria by ringing the
great bell in the Palazzo Vecchio tower. Usually such a general assembly
chose a balia or commission of reform, gave it supreme power for a
stated period, and adjourned.</p>
<p>It was a generous error of nineteenth-century historians to credit
pre- Medicean Florence with a degree of democracy quite unknown in that
plutocratic paradise. The subject cities, though themselves fertile in
genius and proud of their heritage, had no voice in the Florentine
Signory that governed them. In Florence only 3200 males could vote; and
in both councils the representatives of the business class were a rarely
challenged</p>

<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>majority. 11 The upper classes were convinced that the illiterate
masses could form no sound or safe judgment of the community good in
domestic crises or foreign affairs. The Florentines loved freedom, but
it was, among the poor, the freedom to be commanded by Florentine
masters, and, among the rich, the liberty to rule the city and its
dependencies without imperial or papal or feudal impediment.</p>
<p>The indisputable defects of the constitution were the brevity of its
terms of office, and the frequent changes in the constitution itself.
The evil re- sults were faction, conspiracy, violence, confusion,
incompetence, and the inability of the republic to design and execute
such consistent and long- term policies as made for the stability and
power of Venice. The pertinent good result was an electric atmosphere of
conflict and debate that quick- ened the pulse, sharpened sense and mind
and wit, stirred the imagination, and lifted Florence for a century to
the cultural leadership of the world.</p>
<p>hi. cosimo “pater patriae”</p>
<p>Politics in Florence was the conflict of wealthy families and
factions — the Ricci, Albizzi, Medici, Ridolfi, Pazzi, Pitti, Strozzi,
Rucellai, Valori,</p>
<p>Capponi, Soderini — for control of the government. From 1381 to 1434,
with some interruptions, the Albizzi maintained their ascendancy in the
state, and valiantly protected the rich against the poor.</p>
<p>The Medici family can be traced back to 1201, when Chiarissimo de’
Medici was a member of the Communal Council.* Averardo de’ Medici,
great-great-grandfather of Cosimo, founded the fortune of the family by
bold commerce and judicious finance, and was chosen gonfalonier in 1314.
Averardo’s grandnephew, Salvestro de’ Medici, gonfalonier in 137 8,
estab- lished the popularity of the family by espousing the cause of the
rebel poor. Salvestro’s grandnephew, Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici,
gonfalonier in 1421, further endeared the family to the people by
supporting — though he himself would suffer heavily from it — an annual
tax ( catasto ) of one half of one per cent on income, which was
reckoned at seven per cent of a man’s capital (1427). 12 The rich, who
had previously enjoyed a poll or head tax merely equal to that paid by
the poor, vowed vengeance on the Medici.</p>
<ul>
<li>The origin of their name is a mystery. There is no evidence that
they were physicians, though they may at one time have joined a medical
guild in the loose way of Florentine guild demarcations. Nor do we know
the meaning of their famous emblem, the six red balls ( palle ) on a
field of gold. These balls, reduced to three, became the insignia of
pawn- brokers in later times.</li>
</ul>
<p>74</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>Giovanni di Bicci died in 1428, bequeathing to his son Cosimo a good
name and the largest fortune in Tuscany — 179,221 florins (,480,525?).”
Cosimo was already thirty-nine years old, fully fit to carry on the
far-flung enterprises of the firm. These were not confined to banking;
they included the management of extensive farms, the manufacture of silk
and woolen goods, and a varied trade that bound Russia and Spain,
Scotland and Syria, Islam and Christendom. Cosimo, while building
churches in Florence, saw no sin in making trade agreements, and
exchanging costly presents, with Turkish sultans. The firm made a
specialty of importing from the East articles of little bulk and great
value, like spices, almonds, and sugar, and sold these and other
products in a score of European ports.</p>
<p>Cosimo directed all this with quiet skill, and found time left for
politics. As a member of the Died, or War Council of Ten, he guided
Florence to victory against Lucca, and as a banker he financed the war
by lending large sums to the government. His popularity excited the envy
of other mag- nates, and in 1433, Rinaldo degli Albizzi launched an
attack upon him as planning to overthrow the Republic and make himself
dictator. Rinaldo persuaded Bernardo Guadagni, then gonfalonier, to
order Cosimo’s arrest; Cosimo surrendered himself, and was confined in
the Palazzo Vecchio. Since Rinaldo, with his armed retainers, dominated
the parlamento in the Piazza della Signoria, a decree of death seemed
imminent. But Cosimo man- aged to convey a thousand ducats (5,000?) to
Bernardo, who suddenly became more humane, and compromised by having
Cosimo, his sons, and his chief supporters banished for ten years. 14
Cosimo took up his residence in Venice, where his modesty and his means
made him many friends. Soon the Venetian government was using its
influence to have him recalled. The Signory elected in 1434 was
favorable to him, and reversed the sentences of exile; Cosimo returned
in triumph, and Rinaldo and his sons fled.</p>
<p>A parlamento appointed a balia, and gave it supreme power. After</p>
<p>serving three short terms Cosimo relinquished all political
positions; “to be elected to office,” he said, “is often prejudicial to
the body and hurtful to the soul.” 15 Since his enemies had left the
city, his friends easily dominated the government. Without disturbing
republican forms, he managed, by persuasion or money, to have his
adherents remain in office to the end of his life. His loans to
influential families won or forced their support; his gifts to the
clergy enlisted their enthusiastic aid; and his public benefactions, of
unprecedented scope and generosity, easily reconciled the citizens to
his rule. The Florentines had observed that the constitution of the

<p>Ciompi had burned this lesson into the public memory. If the populace
had to choose between the Albizzi, who favored the rich, and the Medici,
who favored the middle classes and the poor, it could not long hesitate.
A peo- ple oppressed by its economic masters, and weary of faction,
welcomed dictatorship in Florence in 1434, in Perugia in 1389, in
Bologna in 1401, in Siena in 1477, in Rome in 1347 and 1922. “The
Medici,” said Villani, “were enabled to attain supremacy in the name of
freedom, and with the support of the popolo and the populace.” 18</p>
<p>Cosimo used his power with shrewd moderation, tempered with occa-
sional violence. When his friends suspected that Baldaccio d’Anghiari
was forming a conspiracy to end Cosimo ’s power, they threw Baldaccio
out of a sufficiently high window to ensure his termination, and Cosimo
did not complain; it was one of his quips that “states are not ruled
with pater - nosters.” He replaced the fixed income tax w ith a sliding
scale of levies on capital, and was accused of adjusting these
assessments to favor his friends and discourage his enemies. These
levies totaled 4,875,000 florins (21,- 875,000) in the first twenty
years of Cosimo’s ascendancy; and those who balked at paying them were
summarily jailed. Many aristocrats left the city and resumed the rural
life of the medieval nobility. Cosimo accepted their departure with
equanimity, remarking that new aristocrats could be made with a few
yards of scarlet cloth. 17</p>
<p>The people smiled approval, for they noted that the levies were
devoted to the administration and adornment of Florence, and that Cosimo
himself con- tributed 400,000 florins (0,000,000?) to public works and
private chari- ties; 18 this was almost double the sum that he left to
his heirs. 19 He labored assiduously to the end of his seventy-five
years, managing at once his own properties and the affairs of the state.
When Edward IV of England asked for a substantial loan, Cosimo obliged
him, ignoring the faithlessness of Edward III, and the King repaid him
with coin and political support. Tom- maso Parentucelli, Bishop of
Bologna, ran out of funds and asked for aid; Cosimo supplied him; and
when Parentucelli became Pope Nicholas V Cosimo was given charge of all
papal finances. To keep the varied threads of his activity from
tangling, he rose early, and went nearly every day to his office, like
an American millionaire. At home he pruned his trees and tended his
vines. He dressed simply, ate and drank temperately, and (after
begetting an illegitimate son by a slave girl) lived a quiet and orderly
fam- ily life. Those who were admitted to his home were astonished at
the con- trast between the homely fare of his private table and the
lavish feasts that he provided for foreign dignitaries as a lure to
comity and peace. He was</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>normally humane, mild, forgiving, reticent and yet known for his dry
wit. He was generous to the poor, paid the taxes of impoverished
friends, and hid his charity, like his power, in a gracious anonymity.
Botticelli, Pont- ormo, and Benozzo Gozzoli have pictured him for us: of
middle stature and olive complexion, with gray receding hair, long,
sharp nose, and a grave, kindly countenance bespeaking shrewd wisdom and
calm strength.</p>
<p>His foreign policy was dedicated to the organization of peace. Coming
to power after a series of ruinous conflicts, Cosimo noted how war,
actual or imminent, hobbled the march of trade. When the rule of the
Visconti in Milan collapsed in chaos at Filippo Maria’s death, and
Venice threatened</p>
<p>It was the good fortune of Italy and mankind that Cosimo cared as
much for literature, scholarship, philosophy, and art as for wealth and
power. He was a man of education and taste; he knew Latin well, and had
a smattering of Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic; he was broad enough to
appreciate the piety and painting of Fra Angelico, the engaging
rascality of Fra Filippo Lippi, the classical style of Ghiberti’s
reliefs, the bold originality of Dona - tello’s sc ulpture, the
grandiose churches of Brunellesco, the restrained power of Michelozzo’s
architecture, the pagan Platonism of Gemistus Pletho, the mystic
Platonism of Pico and Ficino, the refinement of Alberti, the learned
vulgarity of Poggio, the bibliolat ry of Niccolo de’ Niccoli; and all
these men experienced his generosity. He brought Joannes Argyro- poulos
to Florence to instruct its youth in the language and literature of
ancient Greece, and for twelve years he studied with Ficino the classics
of Greece and Rome. He spent a large part of his fortune collecting
classic texts, so that the most costly cargoes of his ships were in many
cases manu- scripts carried from Greece or Alexandria. When Niccolo de’
Niccoli had ruined himself in buying ancient manuscripts, Cosimo opened
for him an unlimited credit at the Medici bank, and supported him till
death. He en- gaged forty-five copyists, under the guidance of the
enthusiastic book-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 77</p>
<p>seller Vespasiano da Bisticci, to transcribe such manuscripts as
could not be bought. All these “precious minims” he placed in rooms at
the monastery of San Marco, or in the abbey of Fiesole, or in his own
library. When Nic- coli died (1437), leaving eight hundred manuscripts
valued at 6000 florins (50,000), along with many debts, and naming
sixteen trustees to de- termine the disposal of the books, Cosimo
offered to assume the debts if he might allocate the volumes. It was so
agreed, and Cosimo divided the col- lection bet ween San Marco’s library
and his own. All these collections were open to teachers and students
without charge. Said the Florentine historian Varchi, with patriotic
exaggeration:</p>
<p>That Greek letters were not completely forgotten, to the great</p>
<p>loss of humanity, and that Latin letters have been revived to the</p>
<p>infinite benefit of the people — this all Italy, nay all the world,
owes</p>
<p>solely to the high wisdom and friendliness of the house of the</p>
<p>Medici. 21</p>
<p>Of course the great work of revival had been inaugurated by the
transla- tors in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and by Arabic
commentators, and by Petrarch and Boccaccio. It had been continued by
scholars and collectors like Salutati, Traversari, Bruni, and Valla
before Cosimo; it was carried forward independently of him by Niccoli,
Poggio, Filelfo, King Alfonso the Magnanimous of Naples, and a hundred
other contemporaries of Cosimo, even by his exiled rival, Palla Strozzi.
But if we embrace in our judgment not only Cosimo Pater Patriae , but
his descendants Lorenzo the Magnificent, Leo X, and Clement VII, we may
admit that in the patronage of learning and art the Medici have never
been equaled by any other family in the known history of mankind.</p>

<li>THE HUMANISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>It was under the Medici, or in their day, that the humanists
captivated the mind of Italy, turned it from religion to philosophy,
from heaven to earth, and revealed to an astonished generation the
riches of pagan thought and art. These men mad about scholarship
received, as early as Ariosto, 22 the name of umanisti because they
called the study of classic culture umanitH — the “humanities”— or
literae humaniores — not “more humane” but more human letters. The
proper study of mankind was now to be man, in all the potential strength
and beauty of his body, in all the joy and pain of his senses and
feelings, in all the frail majesty of his reason; and in these as</p>
<p>78 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>most abundantly and perfectly revealed in the literature and art of
ancient Greece and Rome. This was humanism.</p>
<p>Nearly all the Latin, and many of the Greek classics now extant were
known to medieval scholars here and there; and the thirteenth century
was acquainted with the major pagan philosophers. But that century had
al- most ignored Greek poetry; and many ancient worthies now honored by
us lay neglected in monastic or cathedral libraries. It was mostly in
such forgotten corners that Petrarch and his successors found the “lost”
classics, “gentle prisoners,” he called them, “held in captivity by
barbarous jailers.” Boccaccio, visiting Monte Cassino, was shocked to
find precious manu- scripts rotting in dust, or mutilated to make
psalters or amulets. Poggio, visiting the Swiss monastery of St. Gall
while attending the Council of Constance, found the Institutiones of
Quintilian in a foul dark dungeon, and felt, as he reclaimed the rolls,
that the old pedagogue was stretching out his hands, begging to be saved
from the “barbarians”; for by that name the culture-conscious Italians,
like the ancient Greeks and Romans, called their virile conquerors
beyond the Alps. Poggio alone, undeterred by winter’s cold or snow,
exhumed from such tombs the texts of Lucretius, Columella, Frontinus,
Vitruvius, Valerius Flaccus, Tertullian, Plautus, Petronius, Am- mianus
Marcellinus, and several major speeches of Cicero. Coluccio Salutati
unearthed Cicero’s letters ad familiares at Vercelli ( 1389) ; Gherardo
Land - riani found Cicero’s treatises on rhetoric in an old chest at
Lodi (1 422); Ambrogio Traversari rescued Cornelius Nepos from oblivion
in Padua ( 1434) ; the Agricola, Germania, and Dialogi of Tacitus were
discovered in Germany (1455); the first six books of Tacitus’ Annales,
and a full manu - script of the younger Pliny’s letters were recovered
from the monastery of Corvey (1508), and became a prize possession of
Leo X.</p>
<p>In the half century before the Turks took Constantinople a dozen hu-
manists studied or traveled in Greece; one of them, Giovanni Aurispa,
brought back to Italy 238 manuscripts, including the plays of Aeschylus
and Sophocles; another, Francesco Filelfo, salvaged from Constantinople
(1427) texts of Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Demosthenes, Aeschi-
nes, and Aristotle, and seven dramas of Euripides. When such literary
ex- plorers returned to Italy with their finds they were welcomed like
vic- torious generals, and princes and prelates paid well for a share of
the spoils. The fall of Constantinople resulted in the loss of many
classics previously mentioned by Byzantine writers as in the libraries
of that city; nevertheless thousands of volumes were saved, and most of
them came to Italy; to this day the best manuscripts of Greek classics
are in Italy. For three centuries,</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 79</p>
<p>from Petrarch to Tasso, men collected manuscripts with philatelic
passion. Niccolo de’ Niccoli spent more than he had in this pursuit;
Andreolo de Ochis was ready to sacrifice his home, his wife, his life to
add to his library; Poggio suffered when he saw money being spent on
anything else than books.</p>
<p>An editorial revolution ensued. The texts so recovered were studied,
compared, corrected, and explained in a campaign of scholarship that
ranged from Lorenzo Valla in Naples to Sir Thomas More in London. Since
these labors in many cases required a knowledge of Greek, Italy — and
later France, England, and Germany — sent out a call for teachers of
Greek. Aurispa and Filelfo learned the language in Greece itself. After
Manuel Chrysoloras came to Italy (1397) as Byzantine envoy, the
University of Florence persuaded him to join its faculty as professor of
Greek language and literature. Among his pupils there were Poggio, Palla
Strozzi, Marsup- pini, and Manetti. Leonardo Bruni, studying law,
abandoned it, under the spell of Chrysoloras, for the study of Greek; “I
gave myself to his teaching with such ardor,” he tells us, “that my
dreams at night were filled with what I had learned from him during the
day.” 23 Who now could imagine that Greek grammar was once an adventure
and a romance?</p>
<p>In 1439 Greeks met Italians at the Council of Florence, and the
lessons they exchanged in language had far more result than their
laborious negoti- ations in theology. There Gemistus Pletho gave the
famous lectures that ended the reign of Aristotle in European philosophy
and enthroned Plato as almost a god. When the Council dispersed, Joannes
Bessarion, who had come to it as Bishop of Nicaea, remained in Italy and
gave part of his time to teaching Greek. Other cities contracted the
fever; Bessarion brought it to Rome; Theodorus Gaza taught Greek at
Mantua, Ferrara (1444), and Rome (1451); Demetrius Chalcondyles taught
at Perugia (1450), Padua, Florence, and Milan ( c. 1492-1 5 1 1 ) ;
Joannes Argyropoulos at Padua (1441), Florence (1456-71), and Rome
(1471-86). All these men came to Italy before the fall of Constantinople
(1453), so that that event played a minor role in the transit of Greek
from Byzantium to Italy; but the gradual encirclement of Constantinople
by the Turks after 1356 shared in per- suading Greek scholars to go
west. One of those who fled at the collapse of the Eastern capital was
Constantine Lascaris, who came to teach Greek at Milan (1460-5), Naples,
and Messina (1466-1501). The first Greek book printed in Renaissance
Italy was his Greek grammar.</p>
<p>With all these scholars and their pupils enthusiastically active in
Italy, it was but a short time when the classics of Greek literature and
philosophy</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. HI</p>
<p>were rendered into Latin with more thoroughness, accuracy, and finish
than in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Guarino translated parts
of Strabo and Plutarch; Traversari, Diogenes Laertius; Valla, Herodotus,
Thucydides, and the Iliad; Perotti, Polybius; Ficino, Plato and
Plotinus. Plato, above all, amazed and delighted the humanists. They
gloried in the fluid grace of his style; they found in the Dialogues a
drama more vivid and contemporary than anything in Aeschylus, Sophocles,
or Euripides; they envied and marveled at the freedom with which the
Greeks of Soc- rates’ time discussed the most crucial problems of
religion and politics; and they thought they had found in Plato —
clouded with Plotinus — a mystical philosophy that would enable them to
retain a Christianity that they had ceased to believe in, but never
ceased to love. Moved by the eloquence of Gemistus Pletho and the
enthusiasm of his pupils at Florence, Cosimo established there (1445) a
Platonic Academy for the study of Plato, and provided handsomely for
Marsilio Ficino to give half a lifetime to the translation and
exposition of Plato’s works. Now, after a reign of four hundred years,
Scholasticism lost its domination in the philosophy of the West; the
dialogue and essay replaced the scholastica disputatio as the form of
philosophical exposition, and the exhilarating spirit of Plato entered
like an energizing yeast into the rising body of European thought.</p>
<p>But as Italy recovered more and more of its own classic heritage, the
admiration of the humanists for Greece was surpassed by their pride in
the literature and art of ancient Rome. They revived Latin as a medium
of living literature; they Latinized their names, and Romanized the
terms of Christian worship and life: God became Iuppiter, Providence
fatum, the saints diin, nuns vestales, the pope pontifex maximus. They
fashioned their prose style on Cicero, their poetry on Virgil and
Horace; and some, like Filelfo, Valla, and Politian, achieved an almost
classic elegance. So, in its course, the Renaissance moved back from
Greek to Latin, from Athens to Rome; fifteen centuries appeared to fall
away, and the age of Cicero and Horace, of Ovid and Seneca, seemed
reborn. Style became more important than substance, form triumphed over
matter; and the oratory of majestic periods rang again in the halls of
princes and pedagogues. Perhaps it would have been better if the
humanists had used Italian; but they looked down upon the speech of the
Commedia and the Canzoniere as a corrupt and degenerate Latin (which
almost it was), and deplored Dante’s choice of the vernacular tongue. As
a penalty the humanists lost touch with the living sources of
literature; and the people, leaving their works to the aristocracy,
preferred the jolly tales — no velle — of Sacchetti and Bandello,</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MEDICI</p>
<p>8l</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>or the exciting mixture of war and love in the romances that were
being translated or adapted into Italian from the French. Nevertheless
this pass- ing infatuation with a dying language and an “immortal”
literature helped Italian authors to recapture the architecture,
sculpture, and music of style, and to formulate the canons of taste and
utterance that lifted the vernacu- lars to literary form, and set a goal
and a standard for art. In the field of history it was the humanists who
ended the succession of medieval chroni- cles — chaotic and uncritical —
by scrutinizing and harmonizing sources, marshaling the matter into
order and clarity, vitalizing and humanizing the past by mingling
biography with history, and raising their narratives to some level of
philosophy by discerning causes, currents, and effects, and studying the
regularities and lessons of history.</p>
<p>The humanist movement spread throughout Italy, but until the
accession of a Florentine Medici to the papacy its leaders were almost
all citizens or graduates of Florence. Coluccio Salutati, who became
executive secretary or chancellor (canc ellarius) to the Signory in
1375, was a bridge from Petrarch and Boccaccio to Cosimo, knowing and
loving all three. The public documents drawn up by him were models of
classical Latinity, and set an example that officials in Venice, Milan,
Naples, and Rome bestirred themselves to follow; Giangaleazzo Visconti
of Milan said that Salutati had done him more harm by excellence of
style than could have come from an army of mercenaries. 24 The fame of
Niccolo de’ Niccoli as a Latin stylist rivaled his renown as a collector
of manuscripts; Bruni called him the “censor of the Latin tongue,” and,
like other authors, submitted his own writings to Niccoli for correction
before publishing them. Niccoli filled his house with ancient classics,
statuary, inscriptions, vases, coins, and gems. He avoided marriage lest
it distract him from his books, but found time for a concubine stolen
from his brother’s bed. 25 He opened his library to all who cared to
study there, and urged young Florentines to abandon luxury for
literature. Seeing a wealthy youth idling the day away, Niccoli asked
him, “What is your object in life?” “To have a good time,” was the frank
reply. “But when your youth is over, of what con - sequence will you
be?” 26 The youth saw the point, and put himself under Niccoli’ s
tutelage.</p>
<p>Leonardo Bruni, secretary to four popes and then (1427-44) to the</p>
<p>Florentine Signory, translated several dialogues of Plato into a
Latin whose excellence for the first time fully revealed the splendor of
Plato’s style to</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap, in</p>
<p>pared with those of Pericles. When he died the priors decreed him a
pub- lic funeral after the manner of the ancients; he was buried in the
church of Santa Croce, with his History on his breast; and Bernardo
Rossellino de- signed for his resting place a noble and sumptuous
tomb.</p>
<p>Bom like Bruni in Arezzo, and succeeding him as secretary to the</p>
<p>Signory, Carlo Marsuppini awed his time by carrying half the classics
of Greece and Rome in his head; he left hardly one ancient author
unquoted in his inaugural address as professor of literature in the
University of Florence. His admiration for pagan antiquity was such that
he felt called upon to reject Christianity; 27 nevertheless he became
for a time apostolic secretary to the Roman See; and though he was said
to have died without bothering to receive the sacraments, 28 he too was
buried in Santa Croce under gorgeous oratory by Giannozzo Manetti and an
ornate tomb by Desiderio da Settignano (1453). Manetti, who pronounced
this eulogy over an atheist, was a man whose piety rivaled his learning.
For nine years he hardly stirred from his house and garden, steeping
himself in classical literature, and learning Hebrew as well as Latin
and Greek. Sent as am- bassador to Rome, Naples, Venice, Genoa, he
charmed all, and won friend- ships precious to his government by his
culture, his liberality, and his in- tegrity.</p>
<p>All these men except Salutati were members of the circle that
gathered in the city house or country villa of Cosimo, and led the
movement of scholarship during his ascendancy. Another friend of Cosimo
almost equaled him as a host to learning. Ambrogio Traversari, general
of the Camaldulite order, lived in a cell in the monastery of Santa
Maria degli Angeli near Florence. He mastered Greek, and suffered qualms
of con- science in his affection for the classics; he refrained from
quoting them in his writings, but revealed their influence in a Latin
style whose idiomatic purity would halve shocked all the famous
Gregories. Cosimo, who knew how to reconcile the classics, as well as
high finance, with Christianity, loved to visit him. Niccoli,
Marsuppini, Bruni, and others made his cell a literary rendezvous.</p>
<p>The most active and troublesome of the Italian humanists was Poggio
Bracciolini. Born poor near Arezzo (1380), he was educated at Florence,
studied Greek under Manuel Chrysoloras, supported himself by copying
manuscripts, was befriended by Salutati, and secured appointment, at
twenty-four, as a secretary in the papal chancery at Rome. For the next
half century he served the Curia, never taking even minor orders, but
wearing ecclesiastical dress. Valuing his energy and his learning, the
Curia</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 83</p>
<p>sent him on a dozen missions. From these he digressed, time and
again, to search for classic manuscripts; his credentials as a papal
secretary won him access to the most jealously guarded, or most
carelessly neglected, treasures in the monastic libraries at St. Gall,
Langres, Weingarten, and Reichenau; and his spoils were so rich that
Bruni and other humanists hailed them as epochal. Back in Rome he wrote
for Martin V vigorous defenses of</p>
<p>Church dogmas, and then, in private gatherings, joined with other em-
ployees of the Curia in laughing at the Christian creed. 29 He composed
dialogues and letters in rough but breezy Latin, satirizing the vices of
the clergy even while practising them to the extent of his means. When
Cardinal Sant’ Angelo reproved him for having children, which hardly
befitted a man in ecclesiastical dress, and for maintaining a mistress,
which seemed unbecoming in a layman, Poggio replied with his usual
insolence: “I have children, which is becoming to a layman, and I have a
mistress, which is an old custom of the clergy.” 30 At fifty -five he
abandoned the mistress who had given him fourteen children, and married
a girl of eight- een. Meanwhile he almost founded modern archeology by
collecting ancient coins, inscriptions, and statuary, and by describing
with scholarly precision the surviving monuments of classic Rome. He
accompanied Pope Eugenius IV to the Council of Florence, quarreled with
Francesco Filelfo, and exchanged with him enthusiastic invectives of the
coarsest indecency, peppered with accusations of theft, atheism, and
sodomy. Again in Rome, he worked with especial pleasure for the humanist
Pope Nicholas V. At seventy he composed his famous Liber facetiarum, a
col- lection of stories, satires, and obscenities. When Lorenzo Valla
joined the papal secretariat Poggio attacked him in a new series of
Invectivae, charg- ing him with larceny, forgery, treachery, heresy,
drunkenness, and im- morality. Valla replied by laughing at Poggio ’s
Latin, quoting his sins against grammar and idiom, and setting him aside
as a fool in his dotage. 31 No one but the immediate victim took such
literary assaults seriously; they were competitive essays in Latin
composition; indeed Poggio proclaimed, in one of them, that he would
show how well classic Latin could express the most modern ideas and the
most private concerns. He was so adept in the art of erudi te scurrility
that “the whole world,” said Vespasiano, “was afraid of him.” 32 His
pen, like that of a later Aretine, became an instrument of blackmail.
When Alfonso of Naples delayed in acknowl- edging Poggio’s gift of
Xenophon’s Cyropaedia translated into Latin, the irate humanist hinted
that a good pen could stab any king, and Alfonso hastily sent him 500
ducats to hold his tongue. After enjoying every in-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>stinct and impulse for seventy years, Poggio composed a treatise De
miseriis humanae conditionis, in which he reckoned that the ills of life
out- weigh the joys, and concluded,.like Solon, that the luckiest people
are those who escape being bom. 83 At seventy-two he returned to
Florence, was soon made secretary to the Signory, and finally was
elected to the Signory itself. He expressed his appreciation by writing
a history of</p>
<p>Florence in the style of the ancients — politics, war, and imaginary
speeches. Other humanists breathed relief when at last, aged
seventy-nine, he died (1459). He too was buried in Santa Croce; his
statue by Donatello was erected on the fagade of the duomo; and in 1
560, in the confusion of some alterations, it was set up inside the
cathedral as one of the twelve Apostles. 34</p>
<p>It is clear that Christianity, in both its theology and its ethics,
had lost its hold on perhaps a majority of the Italian humanists.
Several, like</p>
<p>Traversari, Bruni, and Manetti in Florence, Vittorino da Feltre in
Mantua, Guarino da Verona in Ferrara, and Flavio Biondo in Rome,
remained loyal to the faith. But to many others the revelation of a
Greek culture lasting a thousand years, and reaching the heights of
literature, philosophy, and art in complete independence of Judaism and
Christianity, was a mortal blow to their belief in the Pauline theology,
or in the doctrine of nulla salus extra ecclesiam — “no salvation
outside the Church.” Socrates and Plato became for them uncanonized
saints; the dynasty of the Greek philosophers seemed to them superior to
the Greek and Latin Fathers, the prose of Plato and Cicero made even a
cardinal ashamed of the Greek of the New Testament and the Latin of
Jerome’s translation; the grandeur of Imperial Rome seemed nobler than
the timid retreat of convinced Chris- tians into monastic cells; the
free thought and conduct of Periclean Greeks or Augustan Romans filled
many humanists with an envy that shattered in their hearts the Christian
code of humility, otherworldliness, continence; and they wondered why
they should subject body, mind, and soul to the rule of ecclesiastics
who themselves were now joyously converted to the world. For these
humanists the ten centuries between Constantine and Dante were a tragic
error, a Dantesque losing of the right road; the lovely legends of the
Virgin and the saints faded from their memory to make room for Ovid’s
Metamorphoses and Horace’s ambisexual odes; the great cathedrals now
seemed barbarous, and their gaunt statuary lost all charm for eyes that
had seen, fingers that had touched, the Apollo Belvedere. So the
humanists, by and large, acted as if Christianity were a myth</p>
<p>conformable to the needs of popular imagination and morality, but not
to be taken seriously by emancipated minds. They supported it in
their</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 85’</p>
<p>public pronouncements, professed a saving orthodoxy, and struggled to
harmonize Christian doctrine with Greek philosophy. The very effort
betrayed them; implicitly they accepted reason as the supreme court, and
honoured Plato’s Dialogues equally with the New Testament. Like the
Sophists of pre-Socratic Greece, they directly or indirectly, willfully
or unwittingly undermined their hearers’ religious faith. Their lives
reflected</p>
<p>The influence of the humanists was for a century the dominant factor
in the intellectual life of Western Europe. They taught writers a
sharper sense of structure and form; they taught them also the artifices
of rhetoric, the frills of language, the abracadabra of mythology, the
fetishism of classi- cal quotation, the sacrifice of significance to
correctness of speech and beauty of style. Their infatuation with Latin
postponed for a century (1400-1500) the development of Italian poetry
and prose. They emanci- pated science from theology, but impeded it by
worshiping the past, and by stressing erudition rather than objective
observation and original thought. Strange to say, they were least
influential in the universities. These were already old in Italy; and at
Bologna, Padua, Pisa, Piacenza, Pavia, Naples, Siena, Arezzo, Lucca, the
faculties of law, medicine, the- ology, and “arts”— i.e., language,
literature, rhetoric, and philosophy — were too mortised in medieval
custom to allow a new emphasis on ancient cul- tures; at most they
yielded, here and there, a chair of rhetoric to a humanist. The
influence of the “revival of letters” operated chiefly through academies
founded by patron princes in Florence, Naples, Venice, Ferrara, Mantua,
Milan, and Rome. There the humanists dictated in Greek or Latin the
classic text they proposed to discuss; at each step they commented in
Latin on the grammatical, rhetorical, geographical, biographical, and
literary aspects of the text; their students took down the dictated
text, and, in the margins, much of the commentary; in this way copies of
the classics, and of commentaries as well, were multiplied and were
scattered into the world. The age of Cosimo was therefore a period of
devoted scholarship,</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>rather than of creative literature. Grammar, lexicography,
archeology, rhetoric, and the critical revision of classical texts were
the literary glories of the time. The form, machinery, and substance of
modem erudition were established; a bridge was built by which the legacy
of Greece and Rome passed into the modern mind.</p>
<p>Not since the days of the Sophists had scholars risen to so high a
place in society and politics. The humanists became secretaries and
advisers to senates, signories, dukes, and popes, repaying their favors
with classic eulogies, and their snubs with poisoned epigrams. They
transformed the ideal of a gentleman from a man with ready sword and
clanking spurs into that of the fully developed individual attaining to
wisdom and worth by absorbing the cultural heritage of the race. The
prestige of their learning and the fascination of their eloquence
conquered transalpine Europe at the very time when the arms of France,
Germany, and Spain were pre- paring to conquer Italy. Country after
country was inoculated with the new culture, and passed from medievalism
to modernity. The same cen- tury that saw the discovery of America saw
the rediscovery of Greece and Rome; and the literary and philosophical
transformation had far pro- founder results for the human spirit than
the circumnavigation and ex- ploration of the globe. For it was the
humanists, not the navigators, who liberated man from dogma, taught him
to love life rather than brood about death, and made the European mind
free.</p>
<p>Humanism influenced art last because it appealed rather to intellect
than to sense. The chief patron of art was still the Church, and the
chief pur- pose of art was still to convey the Christian story to the
letterless, and to adorn the house of God. The Virgin and her Child, the
suffering and</p>
<p>crucified Christ, the prophets, Apostles, Fathers, and saints
remained the necessary subjects of sculpture and painting, even of the
minor arts. Grad- ually, however, the humanists taught the Italians a
more sensual sense of beauty; a frank admiration for the healthy human
body — male or female, preferably nude — permeated the educated classes;
the reaffirmation of life in Renaissance literature, as against the
medieval contemplation of another world, gave art a secret secular
leaning; and by finding Italian Aphrodites to pose as Virgins, and
Italian Apollos to serve as Sebastians, the painters of Lorenzo’s age,
and later, introduced pagan motives into Christian art. In the sixteenth
century — when secular princes rivaled ecclesiastics in financing
artists — Venus and Ariadne, Daphne and Diana, the Muses and the Graces
challenged the rule of the Virgin; but Mary the modest mother continued
her wholesome dominance to the end of Renaissance art.</p>

<p>V. ARCHITECTURE: THE AGE OF BRUNELLESCO</p>
<p>“Cursed be the man who invented this wretched Gothic architecture!”
cried Antonio Filarete in 1450; “only a barbarous people could have</p>
<p>brought it to Italy.” 85 Those walls of glass hardly suited the sun
of Italy; those flying buttresses — though at Notre Dame de Paris they
had been forged into a frame of beauty, like fountain jets petrified in
their flow- seemed to the South unsightly scaffoldings left by builders
who had failed to give their structures a self-contained stability. The
Gothic style of pointed arch and soaring vault had well expressed the
aspirations of tender spirits turning from the laborious soil to the
solacing sky; but men new dowered with wealth and ease wished now to
beautify life, not to escape or malign it; earth would be heaven, and
they themselves would be gods.</p>
<p>The architecture of the Italian Renaissance was not basically a
revolt against Gothic, for Gothic had never conquered Italy. Every kind
of</p>
<p>style and influence spoke its piece in the experiments of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: the heavy columns and round arches
of Lombard Romanesque, the Greek cross of some ground plans, the
Byzantine penden- tive and dome, the stately grace of campaniles echoing
Moslem minarets, the slender columns of Tuscan cloisters remembering
mosque or classic porticoes, the beamed ceilings of England and Germany,
the groined vault and ogive and tracery of Gothic, the harmonious
majesty of Roman fa- cades, and, above all, the simple strength of the
basilican nave flanked by its supporting aisles: all these, in Italy,
were mingling fruitfully when the humanists turned architectural vision
to the ruins of Rome. Then the shattered colonnades of the Forum, rising
through the medieval mist, seemed to Italian eyes more beautiful than
the Byzantine bizarreries of Venice, the somber majesty of Chartres, the
fragile audacity of Beauvais, or the mystic reaches of Amiens’ vault. To
build again with columns</p>
<p>finely turned, firmly mortised into massive plinths, gayly crowned
with flowering capitals, and bound to stability by imperturbable
architraves — this became, by the groping emergence of the buried but
living past, the dream and passion of men like Brunellesco, Alberti,
Michelozzo, Michelan- gelo, and Raphael.</p>
<p>“Of Filippo Brunellesco,” wrote the patriotic Vasari, “it may be
said</p>
<p>hat he was given by heaven to invest architecture with new forms,
after it had wandered astray for many centuries.” 30 Like so many

<p>with him and Ghiberti for a commission to sculpture the bronze doors
of the Florentine Baptistery; when he saw Ghiberti’s sketches he
pronounced them superior to his own, and with Donatello he left Florence
to study perspective and design in Rome. He was fascinated by the
ancient and medieval architecture there; he measured the major buildings
in all their elements; he marveled a bove all at the dome of Agrippa’s
Pantheon, 142 feet wide; and he conceived the idea of crowning with such
a dome the unfinished cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in the city of
his birth. He returned to Florence in time to take part in a conference
of architects and engineers on the problem of roofing the cathedral’s
octagonal choir, 13854 feet across. Filippo proposed a dome, but the
expansive pressure that so immense a cupola would exert upon walls
unsupported by external but- tresses or internal beams seemed to the
conferees a forbidding obstacle. All the world knows the story of
Brunellesco’s egg: how he challenged the other artists to make an egg
stand on end, and, after all the rest had failed, himself succeeded by
pressing the blunt and empty end down upon the table. When they
protested that they could have done the the same, he answered that they
would make similar claims after he had domed the cathedral. He received
the commission. For fourteen years (1420-34) he labored intermittently
at the task, fighting a thousand tribulations, rais- ing the cupola
precariously 133 feet above the summit of its supporting walls. At last
it was finished, and stood firm; all the city gloried in it as the first
major achievement — and with one exception the boldest — in the
architecture of the Renaissance. When Michelangelo, a century later,
planned the dome of St. Peter’s, and was told that he had an opportunity
to surpass Brunellesco’s, he answered: “I will make a sister dome,
larger, but not mor e beautiful.” 31 The lordly colorful cupola still
dominates, for leagues around, the panorama of a red-roofed Florence
nestling like a bed of roses in the lap of the Tuscan hills.</p>
<p>Though Filippo had taken his conception from the Pantheon, he had
compromised gracefully with the Tuscan Gothic style of the Florentine
cathedral by curving his dome along the lines of the Gothic pointed
arch. But in buildings that he was allowed to design from the ground he
made his classic revolution more explicit and complete. In 1419 he had
begun, for Cosimo’s father, the church of San Lorenzo; he finished only
the “Old Sacristy”; but there he chose the basilican form, the colonnade
and en - tablature, and the Romanesque arch as the elements of his plan.
In the cloisters of Santa Croce he built for the Pazzi family a pretty
chapel again recalling the dome and colonnaded portico of the Pantheon;
and in those</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 89</p>
<p>same cloisters he designed a rectangular portal — of fluted columns,
flowered capitals, sculptured architrave, and lunette reliefs — which
formed the style of a hundred thousand Renaissance doors, and survives
everywhere in western Europe and America. He began on classic lines the
church of Santo Spirito, but died while the walls had barely left the
ground. In 1446 the corpse of the passionate builder lay in state in the
cathedral under the dome that he had raised; and from Cosimo to the
simple workingman who had labored there the people of Florence came to
mourn that geniuses must die. “He lived as a good Christian,” said
Vasari, “and left to the world the savor of his goodness…. From the time
of the ancient Greeks and Romans until now there has been no man more
rare or more excellent.” 38</p>
<p>In his architectural enthusiasm Brunellesco had designed for Cosimo a
palace so extensive and ornate that the modest dictator, fearing envy,
denied himself the luxury of seeing it take form. Instead he
commissioned Michelozzo di Bartolommeo (1444) to build for him, his
family, and his offices, the existing Palazzo Medici or Riccardi, whose
thick stone walls, bare of ornament, reveal the social disorder, the
family feuds, the daily dread of violence or revolt, that gave a zest to
Florentine politics. Immense iron gates opened to friends and diplomats,
artists and poets, access to a court decorated with statuary by
Donatello, and thence to rooms of moderate splendor, and a chapel
brightened by the stately and colorful frescoes of Benozzo Gozzoli.
There the Medici lived till 1538, with inter- ludes of banishment; but
surely they often left those gloomy walls to take the sun at the villas
that Cosimo built outside the city in Careggi and Cafaggiolo, and on the
slopes of Fiesole. It was in those rural retreats that Cosimo and
Lorenzo, with their friends and proteges, took refuge from politics in
poetry, philosophy, and art; and to Careggi father and grandson retired
for their rendezvous with death. Glancing now and then beyond the grave,
Cosimo gave substantial sums to raise an abbey at Fiesole, and to
rebuild more commodiously the old convent of San Marco. There Michelozzo
designed graceful cloisters, a library for Niccoli’s books, and a cell
where, occasionally, Cosimo withdrew even from his friends, and spent a
day in meditation and prayer.</p>
<p>In these enterprises Michelozzo was his favorite architect and the
un- failing friend who accompanied him into exile, and returned with
him. Soon thereafter the Signory gave Michelozzo the delicate task of
rein- forcing the Palazzo Vecchio against threatened collapse. He
restored the church of Santissima Annunziata, made a lovely tabernacle
for it, and showed himself a sculptor too by adorning it with a statue
of St. John the</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>Ba ptist. For Cosimo’s son Piero he built a magnificent marble chapel
in the hillside church of San Miniato. He pooled his skill with
Donatello’s to design and carve the charming “pulpit of the girdle” on
the fagade of the Prato cathedral. In any other country in that age
Michelozzo would have led his architectural tribe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the merchant aristocracy was raising proud civic halls and
palaces. In 1376 the Signory commissioned Benci di Cione and Simone di
Francesco Talenti to build a portico opposite the Palazzo Vecchio as a
rostrum for governmental oratory; in the sixteenth century it came to be
known as the Loggia dei Lanzi from the German lancers that Duke</p>
<p>Cosimo I stationed there. The most magnificent private palace in
Florence was built (1459) for the banker Luca Pitti by Luca Fancelli
from plans made by Brunellesco nineteen years before. Pitti was almost
as rich as Cosimo, but not so wisely modest; he contested Cosimo’s
power, and drew from him some sharp counsel:</p>
<p>You strive toward the indefinite, I toward the definite. You</p>
<p>plant your ladder in the air, I place mine on the ground…. It</p>
<p>seems to me but just and natural that I should desire the honor and
reputation of my house to surpass yours. Let us therefore do like</p>
<p>wo big dogs, which sniff at one another when they meet, show their
teeth, and then go their separate ways. You will attend to your</p>
<p>affairs, I to mine. 39</p>
<p>Pitti continued to plot; after Cosimo’s. death he conspired to
displace Piero de’ Medici from power. He commi tted the only crime
universally con- demned in the Renaissance — he failed. He was banished
and ruined, and his palace remained unfinished for a century.</p>

<p>The imitation of classic forms was more thorough in sculpture than in
architecture. The sight and study of Roman ruins, and the occasional
recovery of some Roman masterpiece, stirred the sculptors of Italy to an
emulative ecstasy. When the Hermaphrodite that now lies in the Borghese
Gallery — with its neutral back modestly turned to the spectator — was
found in the vineyard of San Celso, Ghiberti wrote of it: “No tongue</p>
<p>could describe the learning and art displayed in it, or do justice to
its mas- terly style”; the perfection of such works, he said, eluded the
eye, and</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 91</p>
<p>could be appreciated only by passing the hand over the marble surface
and curves. 40 As these exhumed relics grew in number and familiarity,
the Italian mind slowly accustomed itself to the nude in art; the study
of anatomy became as much at home in artists’ botteghe as in medical
halls; soon nude models were used without fear and without reproach. So
stimulated, sculpture graduated from subservience to architecture, and
from stone or stucco reliefs to statues of bronze or marble in the
round.</p>
<p>But it was in relief that sculpture won its first and most famous
triumph in the Florence of Cosimo’s time. The ugly striated Baptistery
that fronted the cathedral could only be redeemed by incidental
ornament. Iacopo Torriti had adorned the tribune, and Andrea Tafi the
cupola, with</p>
<p>crowded mosaics; Andrea Pisano had molded a double bronze portal for
the south facade (1330-6); now (1401) the Florentine Signory, in con-
junction with the Guild of Wool Merchants, and to persuade the Deity to
end a plague, voted a generous sum to provide the Baptistery with a
bronze door for the north side. A competition was opened; all the
artists of Italy were invited to submit designs; the most successful —
Brunellesco, Iacopo della Quercia, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and a few others —
were commis- sioned and paid to cast in bronze a sample panel showing
the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham. A year later the completed panels
were submitted to thirty-four judges — sculptors, painters, and
goldsmiths. It was generally agreed that Ghiberti’s was the best; and
the youth of twenty -five began the first pair of his famous bronze
doors.</p>
<p>Only those who have closely studied this north portal can understand
why it took the better part of twenty-one years to design and cast. Ghi-
berti was aided, in generous fellowship, by Donatello, Michelozzo, and a
large corps of assistants; it was as if all were resolved, and all
Florence expected, that these should be the finest bronze reliefs in the
history of art. Ghiberti divided the pair into twenty-eight panels:
twenty told the life of Christ, four pictured Apostles, four represented
Doctors of the Church. When all these had been designed, criticized,
redesigned, cast, and set in place on the door, the donors, not grudging
the 22,000 florins (50,000) already spent, engaged Ghiberti to make a
corresponding double door for the east side of the Baptistery (1425). In
this second undertaking, covering twenty-seven years, Ghiberti had as
assistants men already renowned or soon to be: Brunellesco, Antonio
Filarete, Paolo Uccello, Antonio del Pollaiuolo, and others; his studio
became in the process a school of art that nurtured a dozen geniuses. As
the first pair of doors had illustrated the New Testament, so now, in
ten panels, Ghiberti presented Old Testament</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap, in</p>
<p>scenes, from the creation of man to the visit of the Queen of Sheba
to Solomon; in the borders he added twenty figures in almost full
relief, and varied ornament — animal and floral — of surpassing
loveliness. Here the Middle Ages and the Renaissance met in perfect
harmony: in the very first panel the medieval themes of the creation of
Adam, the temptation of Eve, and the expulsion from Eden were treated
with a classic flow of drapery and a bold exuberance of nudes; and Eve
emerging from Adam’s flesh rivaled the Hellenistic relief of Aphrodite
rising from the sea. Men were astonished to find, in the background of
the actions, landscapes almost as precise in perspective, and as rich in
detail, as in the best painting of the time. Some complained that this
sculpture infringed too much on painting, and overstepped the traditions
of classical relief; it was academically true, but the effect was vivid
and superb. This second double door was by common consent even finer
than the first; Michelangelo considered it “so fine that it would grace
the entrance of paradise”; and Vasari, doubtless thinking only of
reliefs, pronounced it “perfect in every part icular, the finest
masterpiece in the world, whether among the ancients or the mod- ems.”“
Florence was so pleased that it elected Ghiberti to the Signory, and
gave him a substantial property to support his declining years.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Donatello</li>
</ol>
<p>Vasari thought that Donatello had been among the artists chosen to
make trial panels for the Baptistery doors; but Donatello was only a lad
of sixteen at the time. The affectionate diminutive by which his friends
and posterity named him denoted Donato di Niccolo di Betto Bardi. He
learned his art only partly in Ghiberti’s studio; he soon struck out for
himself, passed from the feminine grace of Ghibertian relief to virile
statuary in the round, and revolutionized sculpture not so much by
adopting classic methods and aims as by his uncompromising fidelity to
nature, and the blunt force of his original personality and style. He
was an independent spirit as tough as his David, as bold as his
St. George.</p>
<p>His genius did not develop as rapidly as Ghiberti’s, but i t reached
greater scope and heights. When it matured it spawned masterpieces with
reckless fertility, until Florence was populated with his statues, and
countries be- yond the Alps echoed his fame. At twenty-two he rivaled
Ghiberti by carving for Or San Michele a figure of St. Peter; at
twenty-seven he sur- passed him by adding to that edifice a St. Mark so
strong and simple and</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 93</p>
<p>sincere that “it would have been impossible,” said Michelangelo, “to
reject the G ospel preached by such a straightforward man as this.”* 42
At twenty - three Donatello was engaged to carve a David for the
cathedral; it was only the first of many Davids made by him; the subject
never ceased to please his fancy; perhaps his finest work is the bronze
David ordered by Cosimo, cast in 1430, set up in the courtyard of the
Medici palace, and now in the Bargello. Here the nude figure in the
round made its unblushing debut in Renaissance sculpture: a body smooth
with the firm texture of youthful flesh, a face perhaps too Greek in
profile, a helmet certainly too Greek; in this instance Donatello put
realism aside, indulged his imagina- tion richly, and almost equaled
Michelangelo’s more famous figure of the</p>
<p>He was not so successful with the Baptist; it was a dour subject
alien to his earthly spirit; the two statues of John in the Bargello are
lifeless and absurd. Far finer is a stone relief of a child’s head,
named for no good reason San Giovannino — the youthful St. John. In the
same Salone Dona- telliano St. George unites all the idealism of a
militant Christianity with the restrained lines of Greek art: a figure
firmly and confidently poised, a body mature and strong, a head
Gothically oval and yet prefiguring the classic Brutus of Buonarotti.
For the cathedral fagade at Florence he made two powerful figures — of
Jeremiah and Habbakuk, the latter so bald that Donatello called him lo
Zuccone, “the big pumpkin.” On the Loggia dei Lanzi Donatello’s bronze
Judith , commissioned by Cosimo, still brandishes her sword over
Holofernes; the wine-drugged general sleeps placidly be- fore his
decapitation; he is masterfully conceived and cast; but the young
tyrannicide, overwhelmed with drapery, approaches her deed with inop-
portune calm.</p>
<p>On a brief trip to Rome (1432) Donatello designed a classic
tabernacle in marble for the old St. Peter’s. Probably in Rome he
studied the portrait busts that had survived from the days of the
Empire; in any case it was he who developed the first significant
portrait sculpture of the Renaissance. His chef- d’oeuvre in portraiture
was his bust, in painted terra cotta, of the politician Niccolo da
Uzzano; here he amused and expressed himself with a realism that offered
no compliments but revealed a man. Donatello made his own discovery of
the old truth that art need not always pursue beauty,</p>
<ul>
<li>Or San Michele, erected by Francesco and Simone Talenti and Benci di
Cione (1337-</li>
</ul>
<p>1404), was the religious shrine of the Greater Guilds. Each guild was
represented by a statue placed in a niche on the outer walls. Figures
were contributed to this series by Ghi - berti, Verrocchio, Nanni di
Banco, and Gian Bologna.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>but must seek to select and reveal significant form. Many dignitaries
risked the veracity of his chisel, sometimes to their discomfiture. A
Genoese merchant, dissatisfied with himself as Donatello saw him,
haggled about the price; the matter was referred to Cosimo, who judged
that Donatello had asked too little. The merchant complained that the
artist had taken only a month for the work, so that the fee demanded
came to half a florin (2.50) per day — too much, he thought, for a mere
artist. Donatello smashed the bust into a thousand pieces, saying that
this was a man who could bargain intelligently only about beans. 43</p>
<p>The cities of Italy appreciated him better, and competed for his
services. Siena, Rome, and Venice lured him for a time, but Padua saw
him fashion his masterpiece. In the church of St. Anthony he carved a
marble screen for the altar that covered the bones of the great
Franciscan; and over it he placed moving reliefs and a bronze
Crucifixion most tenderly conceived. In the piazza before the church he
set up (1453) the first important eques- trian statue of modern times;
inspired, doubtless, by the mounted Aurelius in Rome, but thoroughly
Renaissance in face and mood; no idealized phi- losopher-king, but a man
of visibly contemporary character, fearless, ruth- less, powerful —
Gattamelata, “the honeyed cat,” the Venetian general. It is true that
the chafing, foaming horse is too big for his legs, and that the
pigeons, innocent of Vasari, daily bespatter the bald head of the
conquer- ing condottiere; but the pose is proud and strong, as if all
the virtu of Machiavelli’s longing had here passed with the fused bronze
to harden in Donatello’s mold. Padua gazed in astonishment and glory at
this hero rescued from mortality, gave the artist 1650 golden ducats
(1,250) for his six years of toil, and begged him to make their city his
home. He</p>
<p>whimsically demurred: his art could never improve at Padua, where all
men praised him; he must, for art’s sake, return to Florence, where all
men criticized all.</p>
<p>In truth he returned to Florence because Cosimo needed him, and he
loved Cosimo. Cosimo was a man who understood art, and gave him in-
telligent and bountiful commissions; so close was the entente between
them that Donatello “divined from the slightest indica tion all that
Cosimo desired.” 44 At Donatello’s suggestion Cosimo collected ancient
statuary, sarcophagi, arches, columns, and capitals, and placed them in
the Medici gardens for young artists to study. For Cosimo, with
Michelozzo’s col - laboration, Donatello set up in the Baptistery a tomb
of the refugee Anti- pope John XXIII. For Cosimo’s favorite church, San
Lorenzo, he carved</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE MEDICI</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>wo pulpits, and adorned them with bronze reliefs of the Passion; from
those pulpits, among others, Savonarola would launch his bolts against
later Medici. For the altar he molded a lovely terra-cotta bust of
St. Law- rence; for the Old Sacristy he designed two pairs of bronze
doors, and a simple but beautiful sarcophagus fo r Cosimo’s parents.
Other works came from him as if they were child’s play: an exquisite
stone relief of the An - nunciation for the church of Santa Croce; for
the cathedral a Cantoria of Singing Boys — plump putti violently
chanting hymns (1433-8); a bronze bust of a Young Man , the incarnation
of healthy youth (in the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art) ; a Santa Cecilia
(possibly by Desiderio da Settignano), fair enough to be the Christian
muse of song; a bronze relief of the Cruci- fixion (in the Bargello)
overpowering in its realistic detail; and in Santa Croce another
Crucifixion , a gaunt and solitary figure in wood, one of the most
moving representations of this scene, despite Brunellesco’s criticism of
it as “a crucified peasant.”</p>
<p>Patron and artist grew old together, and Cosimo took such care of the
sculptor that Donatello rarely thought about money.. He kept his funds,
says Vasari, in a basket suspended from the ceiling of his studio, and
bade his aides and friends take from it according to their needs,
without con- sulting him. When Cosimo was dying (1464) he recommended
Donatello to the care of his son Piero; Piero gave the old artist a
house in the country, but Donatello soon returned to Florence,
preferring his accustomed studio to the sunshine and insects of the
countryside. He lived in simplicity and content till the age of eighty.
All the artists — nearly all the people — of Florence joined in the
funeral that laid him to rest, as he had asked, in the crypt of San
Lorenzo, beside Co simo’s own tomb (1466).</p>
<p>He had immeasurably advanced the sculptural art. Now and then he
poured toe much force into his poses and designs; often he fell short of
the finished form that exalts Ghiberti’s doors. But his faults were due
to his resolve to express not beauty so much as life, not merely a
strong and healthy body but a complex character or mental state. He
developed sculptural portraiture by extending it from the religious to
the secular field, and by giving his subjects an unprecedented variety,
individuality, and power. Overcoming a hundred technical difficulties,
he created the first great equestrian statue left to us by the
Renaissance. Only one sculp- tor would reach greater heights, and then
by inheriting what Donatello had learne d, achieved, and taught.
Bertoldo was Donatello’s pupil, and the teacher of Michelangelo.</p>

<p>The picture that takes form in our minds, as we read Vasari’s
biographies of Ghiberti and Donatello, shows the studio of a Renaissance
sculptor as the co-operative enterprise of many hands, directed by one
mind, but transmitting the art, day by day, from master to apprentice,
generation after generation. From such studios came minor sculptors who
left to his- tory a less imperious fame, but in their degree contributed
to give to pass- ing beauty a lasting form. Nanni di Banco inherited a
fortune, and had the means to be worthless; but he fell in love with
sculpture and Donatello, and served a faithful apprenticeship under him
until he could set up his own studio. He carved a St. Philip for the
niche of the shoemakers’ guild in Or San Michele, and for the cathedral
a St. Luke seated with the Gospel in his hand, and looking out with all
the confidence of fresh faith upon a Renaissance Italy just beginning to
doubt.</p>
<p>In another studio the brothers Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino com-
bined their skills in architecture and sculpture. Bernardo designed a
classic tomb in Santa Croce for Leonardo Bruni; then, on the accession
of Nicho- las V he went to Rome, and consumed himself in the great
Pope’s archi - tectural revolution. Antonio reached his zenith at
thirty-four (1461)</p>
<p>with his marble tomb in San Miniato, at Florence, for Don Jayme,
Cardinal of Portugal; here is the victory of the classic style in all
but the angel’s wings, the Cardinal’s vestments, and his crown of
virginity— for James had startled his time by his chastity. America has
two lovely examples of Antonio’s work— the marble bust of The Christ
Child in the Morgan Library, and The Young St. John the Baptist in the
National Gallery. And is there anywhere a nobler example of realistic
portraiture than the power- ful head — corrugated with veins and
furrowed with thought — of the physi- cian Giovanni di San Miniato, in
the Victoria and Albert Museum?</p>
<p>Desiderio da Settignano came to Florence from the nearby village that
gave him his cognomen. He joined Donatello’s staff, saw that the
master’s work lacked only patient finish, and distinguished his own
productions with elegance, simplicity, and grace. His tomb for
Marsuppini did not quite equal Rossellino’s for Bruni, but the
tabernacle that he designed for the church of San Lorenzo (1464) pleased
all who saw it; and his inciden- tal portraits* and reliefs augmented
his fame. He died at thirty-six; what might he have done if given, like
his master, eighty years?</p>

<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>Luca della Robbia was granted eighty-two, and used them well; he</p>
<p>raised terra-cotta work almost to the level of a major art, and his
fame out- journeyed Donatello’s; there is hardly a museum in Europe that
does not display the tenderness of his Madonnas, the cheerful blue and
white of his painted clay. Beginning as a goldsmith like so many artists
of the Renais- sance, and learning in that minuscule field all the
delicacies of design, he passed on to sc ulptural relief, and carved
five marble plaques for Giotto’s Campanile. Perhaps the wardens of the
cathedral did not tell Luca that these reliefs excelled Giotto’s, but
they soon commissioned him to adorn the organ loft with a relief
picturing choir boys and girls in the ecstasy of song. Two years later
(1433) Donatello carved a similar Cantoria. The rival reliefs now face
each other in the Opera di duomo or Works of the Cathedral; both of them
powerfully convey the exuberant vitality of child- hood; here the
Renaissance rediscovered children for art. In 1446 the wardens engaged
him to make reliefs for the bronze doors of a cathedral sacristy. These
could not rival Ghiberti’s but they saved Lorenzo de’</p>
<p>Medici’s life in the Pazzi conspiracy. All Flo rence now acclaimed
Luca as a master.</p>
<p>So far he had followed the traditional methods of the sculptor’s art.
Meanwhile, however, he had been experimenting with clay, seeking to find
a way in which this tractable material could be made as beautiful in
texture as marble. He molded the clay into the form designed, covered it
with a glaze of divers chemicals, and baked it in a specially
constructed kiln. The wardens admired the result, and commissioned him
to place terra-cotta representations of the Resurrection and the
Ascension over the doors of the cathedral sacristies (1443, 1446). These
tympanums, though in monochrome white, made a stir by the novelty of
their material and the refinement of their finish and design. Cosimo and
his son Piero ordered similar terra cottas for the Medici palace and for
Piero’s chapel in San Miniato; in these Luca added blue to the dominant
white. Orders came to him now in an abundance that tempted him to rapid
facility. He</p>
<p>brightened with a terra-cotta Coronation of the Virgin the portal of
the church of the Ognissanti, and the portal of the Badia with a
tenderly graceful Madonna and Child , between such angels as might
reconcile us to an eternity of heaven. For the church of San Giovanni in
Pistoia he at- tempted a large terra-cotta Visitation; it was a fresh
departure in the aged features of Elizabeth and the youthful innocence
and diffidence of Mary. So Luca created a new realm of art, and founded
a della Robbia dynasty that would flourish till the end of the
century.</p>

<p>In fourteenth-century Italy painting dominated sculpture; in the
fif-</p>
<p>eenth century sculpture dominated painting; in the sixteenth painting
again took the lead. Perhaps the genius of Giotto in the trecento, of
Dona- tello in the quattrocento, of Leonardo, Raphael, and Titian in the
cinque- cento played some part in this alteration; and yet genius is
more a function than a cause of the spirit of an age. Perhaps in Giot
to’s time the recovery and revelation of classic sculpture had not yet
provided such stimulus and direction as they were to give to Ghiberti
and Donatello. But that stimulus reached its height in the sixteenth
century; why did it not lift the Sanso- vinos and Cellinis, as well as
Michelangelo, above the painters of that time? — and why was
Michelangelo, primarily a sculptor, forced more and more into
painting?</p>
<p>Was it because Renaissance art had tasks and needs too wide and deep
for sculpture? Art, liberated by intelligent and opulent patronage,
wished to cover the whole field of representation and ornament. To do
this with statuary would have taken time, toil, and money prohibitively;
painting could more readily express the double gamut of Christian and
pagan ideas in a hurried and exuberant age. What sculptor could have
portrayed the life of St. Francis as rapidly as Giotto and with Giotto’s
excellence? More - over, Renaissance Italy included a majority of
persons whose feelings and ideas were still medieval, and even the
emancipated minority harbored echoes and memories of the old theology,
of its hopes and fears and mystic visions, its devotion and tenderness
and pervasive spiritual overtones; all these, as well as the beauties
and ideals expressed in Greek and Roman sculpture, had to find vent and
form in Italian art; and painting offered to do it at least more
conveniently, if not also with greater fidelity and sub- tlety, than
sculpture. Sculpture had studied the body so long and lovingly that it
was not at home in representing the soul, though Gothic carvers had now
and then made spiritual stone. Renaissance art had to portray both body
and soul, face and feeling; it had to be sensitive to, take the impress
of, all the range and moods of piety, affection, passion, suffering,
skepti- cism, sensualism, pride, and power. Only laborious genius could
accom- plish this with marble, bronze, or clay; when Ghiberti and
Donatello at- tempted it they had to carry into sculpture the methods,
perspectives, and nuances of painting, and sacrificed to vivid
expression the ideal form and</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 99</p>
<p>placid repose required of Greek statuary in the Golden Age. Finally,
the painter spoke a language more easily understood by the people, in
colors that seized the eye, in scenes or narratives that told beloved
tales; the Church found that painting moved the people more quickly,
touched their hearts more intimately, than any carving of cold marble or
casting of somber bronze. As the Renaissance progressed, and art
broadened its scope and aim, sculpture receded into the background,
painting advanced; and as sculpture had been the highest art expression
of the Greeks, so now painting, widening its field, varying its forms,
improving its skills, became the supreme and characteristic art, the
very face and soul, of the Renais- sance.</p>
<p>In this period it was still groping and immature. Paolo Uccello
studied perspective until nothing else interested him. Fra Angelico was
the per- fection, in life and art, of the medieval ideal. Only Masaccio
felt the new spirit that would soon triumph in Botticelli, Leonardo, and
Raphael.</p>
<p>Certain minor talents had transmitted the techniques and traditions
of the art. Giotto taught Gaddo Gaddi, who taught Taddeo Gaddi, who
taught Agnolo Gaddi, who, as late as 1380, adorned Santa Croce with
frescoes still in Giottesque style. Agnolo’s pupil, Cennino Cennini,
gath - ered into a Libro dell ’ arte (1437) the accumulated knowledge of
his time in drawing, composition, mosaic, pigments, oils, varnishes, and
other phases of the painter’s work. “Here,” says page one, “begins the
Book of the Art, made and composed in the reverence of God and the
Virgin Mary.. * and all the saints… and in the reverence of Giotto, of
Taddeo, and of</p>
<p>Agnolo”; 45 art was becoming a religion. Agnolo’s greatest pupil was
a Camaldulese monk, Lorenzo Monaco. In the magnificent altarpiece — The
Coronation of the Virgin — that Lawrence the Monk painted (1413) for his
monastery “of the Angels,” a fresh vigor of conception and execution
appeared; the faces were individualized, the colors were brilliant and
strong. But in that triptych there was no perspective; the figures in
the rear rose taller than those in the foreground, like heads in an
audience seen from the stage. Who would teach Italian painters the
science of perspective?</p>
<p>Brunellesco, Ghiberti, Donatello had made approaches to it. Paolo</p>
<p>Uccello almost gave his life to the problem; night after night he
pored over it, to the fury of his wife. “How charming a thing is this
perspective!” he told her; “ah, if I could only get you to understand
its delights!” 4 ® Noth - ing seemed to Paolo more beautiful than the
steady approximation and distant merging of parallel lines in the
furrows of a pictured field. Aided by a Florentine mathematician,
Antonio Manetti, he set himself to formu-</p>
<p>IOO</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>late the laws of perspective; he studied how to represent accurately
the receding arches of a vault, the ungainly enlargement of objects as
they advanced into the foreground, the peculiar distortion of columns
arranged in a curve. At last he felt that he had reduced these mysteries
to rules; through these rules one dimension could convey the illusion of
three; paint- ing could represent space and depth; this, to Paolo,
seemed a revolution as great as any in the history of art. He
illustrated his principles in his paint- ing, and colored the cloisters
of Santa Maria Novella with frescoes that startled his contemporaries
but have yielded to the erosion of time. Still surviving is his vivid
portrait of Sir John Hawkwood on a wall of the</p>
<p>cathedral (1436); the proud condottiere, having turned his arms from
at- tacking to defending Florence, now joined, in the duomo } the
company of scholars and saints.</p>
<p>Meanwhile another line of • development had reached from the same
origin to the same end. Antonio Veneziano was a follower of Giotto;
Gherardo Stamina was a pupil of Veneziano; from Stamina stemmed Masolino
da Panicale, who taught Masaccio. Masolino and Masaccio made their own
studies of perspective; Masolino was one of the first Italians to paint
nudes; Masaccio was the first to apply the new principles of perspec-
tive with a success that opened the eyes of his generation, and began a
new era in pictorial art.</p>
<p>His real name was Tommaso Guidi di San Giovanni; Masaccio was a nick-
name meaning Big Thomas, as Masolino meant Little Thomas; Italy was fond
of giving such identifying marks to her children. Taking to the brash at
an early age, he so lost himself in devotion to painting that he
neglected everything else — his clothes, his person, his income, his
debts. He worked a while with Ghiberti, and may have learned in that
bottega - academy the anatomical precision that was to be one mark of
his drawing. He studied the frescoes that Masolino was painting in the
Brancacci Chapel at Santa Maria del Carmine, and noted with special
delight their experiments in perspective and foreshortening. On a pillar
in the abbey church known as the Badia he represented St. Ivo of
Brittany with feet foreshortened as seen from below; the spectators
refused to believe that a saint could have such mighty feet. In Santa
Maria Novella, as part of a fresco of the Trinity, he pictured a barrel
vault in such perfect diminishing perspective that the eye seemed to see
the painted ceiling as sunk into the church wall.</p>
<p>The epochal masterpiece that made him the teacher of three
generations was his continuation of Masolino’s Brancacci Chapel frescoes
on the life of St. Peter (1423). The incident of the tribute money was
represented</p>
<p>CHAP.IIl) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI IOI</p>
<p>by the young artist with a new power of conception and veracity of
line: Christ with stern nobility, Peter in angry majesty, the tax
collector with the lithe frame of a Roman athlete, every Apostle
individualized in fea- ture, raiment, and pose. Buildings and background
hills illustrated the young science of perspective; and Tommaso himself,
self-portrayed by posing to a mirror, became a bearded apostle in the
crowd. While he was working on this series the chapel was consecrated
with processional cere- mony; Masaccio watched the ritual with sharp
retentive eye, then repro- duced it in a fresco in the cloister;
Brunellesco, Donatello, Masolino, Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici, and
Antonio Brancacci, sponsor of the chapel, had taken part, and now found
themselves in the picture.</p>
<p>In 1425, for reasons now unknown, Masaccio left his work unfinished,
and went to Rome. We do not hear of him again, and we can only surmise
that some accident or disease prematurely ended his life. But even
though incomplete those Brancacci frescoes were recognized at once as an
immense step forward in painting. In those bold nudes, graceful
draperies, startling perspectives, realistic foreshortenings, and
precise anatomical details, in this modeling in depth through subtle
gradations of light and shade, all sensed a new departure, whi ch Vasari
called the “modern” style. Every ambitious painter within reach of
Florence came to study the series: Fra Angelico, Fra Lippo Lippi, Andrea
del Castagno, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Perugino, Piero della
Francesca, Leonardo, Fra Bartolommeo, Andrea del Sarto, Michelangelo,
Raphael; no dead man had ever had such distinguished pupils, no artist
since Giotto had wielded, unwittingly, such influence. “Masaccio,” said
Leonardo, “showed by perfect works that</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Fra Angelico</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid these exciting novelties Fra Angelico went quietly his own
medie- val way. Born in a Tuscan village and named Guido di Pietro, he
came to Florence young, and studied painting, probably with Lorenzo
Monaco. His talent ripened quickly, and he had every prospect of making
a com- fortable place for himself in the world, but the love of peace
and the hope of salvation led him to enter the Dominican order (1407).
After a long novitiate in various cities, Fra Giovanni, as he had been
renamed, settled down in the convent of San Domenico in Fiesole (1418).
There, in happy obscurity, he illuminated manuscripts, and painted
pictures for churches</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>and religious confraternities. In 1436 the friars of San Domenico
were transferred to the new convent of San Marco, built by Michelozzo at
Cosimo’s order and expense. During the next nine years Giovanni painted
half a hundred frescoes on the walls of the monastery church, chapter
house, dormitory, refectory, hospice, cloisters, and cells. Meanwhile he
practised religion with such modest devotion that his fellow friars
called him the Angelic Brother — Fra Angelico. No one ever saw him
angry, or succeeded in offending him. Thomas a Kempis would have found
fully realized in him the Imitation of Christ, except for one smiling
lapse: in a Last Judgment the angelic Dominican could not resist placing
a few Fran- ciscan friars in hell. 48</p>
<p>Painting, with Fra Giovanni, was a religious exercise as well as an
esthetic release and joy; he painted in much the same mood in which he
prayed, and he never painted without praying first. Protected from the
harsh com- petitions of life, he saw it all as a hymn of divine
atonement and love. His subjects were invariably religious — the life of
Mary and Christ, the blessed in heaven, the lives of the saints and the
generals of his order. His aim was not so much to create beauty as to
inspire piety. In the chapter house where the friars held their
assemblies he painted the picture that the prior thought should most
frequently be in their minds — the Crucifixion; a powerful
representation, in which Angelico showed his study of the nude, and at
the same time the all-embracing quality of his Christianity; here, at
the foot of the cross, along with St. Dominic, were the founders of
rival orders — Augustine, Benedict, Bernard, Francis, John Gualberto of
the Vallombrosans, Albert of the Carmelites. In a lunette over the
entrance to the hospice, where the friars were required to offer
hospitality to any wayfarer, Angelico told the story of the pilgrim who
proved to be Christ; every pilgrim was to be treated as if he might be
so revealed. Within the hospice are now gathered some of the subjects
painted by Angelico for divers churches and guilds: the Madonna of the
Linaioli (linen workers), where the angel choristers have the pliant
figures of women and the smiling faces of guileless children; a Descent
from the Cross, equal in beauty and tenderness to any of the thousand
representations of that scene in the art of the Renaissance; and a Last
Judgment, a bit too symmetrical, and crowded with lurid and repellent
fantasies, as if to forgive were human and to hate were divine. At the
top of the staircase leading to the cells stands Angelico’s masterpiece,
The Annunciation— an angel of infinite grace al- ready in his obeisance
revering the future Mother of God, and Mary bow- ing and crossing her
hands in humble incredulity. In each of the half hun-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 103</p>
<p>dred cells the loving friar, aided by his friar pupils, found time to
paint a fresco recalling some inspiring Gospel scene — the
Transfiguration, the communion of the Apostles, Magdalen anointing the
feet of Christ. In the double cell where Cosimo played monk, Angelico
painted a Crucifixion, and an Adoration of the Kings gorgeous with such
Eastern costumes as perhaps the artist had seen in the Council of
Florence. In his own cell he pictured the Coronation of the Virgin. It
was his favorite subject, which he painted time and again; the Uffizi
Gallery has one form of it, the Acad- emy at Florence another, the
Louvre a third; best of all is that which Angelico painted for the
dormitory of San Marco, wherein the figures of Christ and Mary are among
the most exquisite in the history of art.</p>
<p>The fame of these devout creations brought Giovanni hundreds of prof-
fered commissions. To all such seekers he replied that they must first
obtain the consent of his prior; that secured, he would not fail them.
When Nicholas V asked him to come to Rome he left his Florentine cell
and went to decorate the chapel of the Pope with scenes from the lives
of St. Stephen and St. Lawrence; they are still among the most pleasant
sights in the Vatican. Nicholas so admired the painter that he offered
to make him archbishop of Florence; Angelico excused himself, and
recommended his beloved prior; Nicholas accepted the suggestion, and Fra
Antonino re- mained a saint even under the pallium.</p>
<p>No painter except El Greco ever made a style so uniquely his own as
Fra Angelico; even a novice can identify his hand. A simplicity of line
and form going back to Giotto; a narrow but ethereal assemblage of
colors- gold, vermilion, scarlet, blue, and green — reflecting a bright
spirit and happy faith; figures perhaps too simply imaged, and almost
without anat- omy; faces beautiful and gentle, but too pale to be alive,
too monotonously alike in monks, angels, and saints, conceived rather as
flowers in paradise; and all redeemed by an ideal spirit of tender
devotion, a purity of mood and thought recalling the finest moments of
the Middle Ages, and never to be captured again by the Renaissance. This
was the final cry of the medieval spirit in art.</p>
<p>Fra Giovanni worked for a year in Rome, for a time in Orvieto; served
for three years as prior of the Dominican convent in Fiesole; was called
back to Rome, and died there at the age of sixty-eight. Probably it was
Lorenzo Valla’s classic pen that wrote his epitaph:</p>
<p>Non mihi sit laudi quod eram velut alter Apelles,</p>
<p>sed quod lucra tills omnia, Christe, dabam;</p>

<p>“Let it not be to my praise that I was as another Apelles, but that I
gave all my gains, O Christ, to your faithful; for some works are for
the earth, some for heaven. I, Giovanni, was a child of the Tu scan City
of Florence.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Fra Filippo Lippi</li>
</ol>
<p>From the gentle Angelico, crossed with the lusty Masaccio, came the
art of a man who preferred life to eternity. Filippo, son of the butcher
Tommaso Lippi, was born in Florence in a poor street behind the convent
of the Carmelites. Orphaned at two, he was reluctantly reared by an
aunt, who rid herself of him when he was eight by entering him into the
Carmel- ite order. Instead of studying the books assigned to him he
covered their margins with caricatures. The prior, noting their
excellence, set him to drawing the frescoes that Masaccio had just
painted in the Carmelite church. Soon the lad was painting frescoes of
his own in that same church; they have disappeared, but Vasari thought
them as good as Masaccio’s. At the age of twenty-six (1432) Filippo left
the monastery; he continued to call himself Fra, brother, friar, but he
lived in the “world” and supported</p>
<p>Filippo is said to have been so amorous that when he saw a woman</p>
<p>who pleased him he would have given all his possessions to have her;
and if he could not succeed in this he quieted the flame of his love</p>
<p>by painting her portrait. This appetite so took possession of him</p>
<p>hat while the humor lasted he paid little or no attention to his
work.</p>
<p>Thus, on one occasion when Cosimo was employing him, he shut</p>
<p>him up in the house so that he might not go out and waste time.</p>
<p>Filippo remained so for two days; but, overcome by his amorous</p>
<p>and bestial desires, he cut up his sheet with a pair of scissors,
and</p>
<p>letting himself out of the window, devoted many days to his
pleas-</p>
<p>ures. When Cosimo could not find him he caused a search to be</p>
<p>made for him, until at length Filippo returned to his labors.
From</p>
<p>hat time forward Cosimo gave him liberty to go and come as he</p>
<p>chose, repenting that he had shut him up… for, he said, geniuses</p>
<p>are celestial forms and not pack asses…. Ever afterward he sought to
hold Filippo by the bonds of affection, and was thus served by</p>
<p>him with greater readiness. 49</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 105</p>
<p>In 1439 “Fra Lippo” described himself, in a letter to Piero de’
Medici, as the poorest friar in Florence, living with, and supporting
with difficulty, six nieces anxious to be married. 50 His work was in
demand, but apparently not as well paid as the nieces wished. His morals
could not have been noto- riously bad, for we find him engaged to paint
pictures for various nunner- ies. At the convent of Santa Margherita in
Prato (unless Vasari and tra- dition err) he fell in love with Lucrezia
Buti, a nun or a ward of the nuns; he persuaded the prioress to let
Lucrezia pose for him as the Virgin; soon they e loped. Despite her
father’s reproaches and appeals she remained with the artist as his
mistress and model, sat for many Virgins, and gave him a son, the
Filippino Lippi of later fame. The wardens of the cathedral at Prato did
not hold these adventures against Filippo; in 1456 they engaged him to
paint the choir with frescoes illustrating the lives of St. John the
Baptist and St. Stephen. These paintings, now much damaged by time, were
acclaimed as masterpieces: perfect in composition, rich in color, alive
with drama — coming to a climax on one side of the choir with the dance
of Salome, on the other with the stoning of Stephen. Filippo found the
task too wearisome for his mobility; twice he ran away from it. In 1461
Cosimo persuaded Pius II to release the artist from his monastic vows;
Filippo seems to have thought himself also freed from fidelity to
Lucrezia, who could no longer pose as a virgin. The Prato wardens
exhausted all schemes for luring him back to his frescoes; at last, ten
years after their inception, he was induced to finish them by Carlo de’
Medici, Cosimo’s illegitimate son, now an apostolic notary. In the scene
of Stephen’s burial Filippo exercised all his powers — in the deceptive
perspective of the architectural back- ground, in the sharply
individualized figures surrounding the corpse, and in the stout
proportions and calm rotund face of Cosimo’s bastard reading the
services for the dead.</p>
<p>Despite his sexual irregularities, and perhaps because of his amiable
sensitivity to the loveliness of woman, Filippo’s finest pictures were
of the Virgin.* They missed the ethereal spirituality of Angelico’s
Madonnas, but they conveyed a deep sense of soft physical beauty and
infinite tender- ness. In Fra Lippo the Holy Family became an Italian
family, surrounded</p>
<p>E.g., the Annunciation in San Lorenzo at Florence — a peasant girl in
modest deprecation; the Virgin Adoring the Child (Berlin), rich in the
blue of the Virgin’s gown and the green bed of flowers beneath the
Child; a Madonna in the Uffizi, with grave blonde face, flowing veil,
and beautifully drawn robe; the Madonna of the Pitti Gallery; the
Madonna and Child of the Medici Palace; the Virgin and Child Between
Saints Frediano and Augustine, in the Louvre; the Coronation of the
Virgin , in the Vatican Pinacoteca; and the Coronation in the Uffizi,
with its graceful auxiliary figures, and Filippo himself, kneeling in
prayer, penitent at last.</p>
<p>106 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>with homely incidents, and the Virgin took on a sensuous loveliness
herald- ing the pagan Renaissance. To these feminine charms Filippo in
his Ma- donnas added an airy grace that passed down to his apprentice
Botticelli.</p>
<p>In 1466 the city of Spoleto invited him to tell the story of the
Virgin</p>
<p>again in the apse of its cathedral. He labored conscientiously,
passion hav- ing cooled; but his powers failed with his passion, and he
could not repeat the excellence of his Prato murals. Amid this effort he
died (1469),</p>
<p>poisoned, Vasari thought, by the relatives of a girl whom he had
seduced. The story is improbable, for Filippo was buried in the Spoleto
cathedral; and there, a few years later, his son, on commission from
Lorenzo de’ Medici, built for his father a splendid marble tomb.</p>
<p>Everyone who creates beauty deserves remembrance, but we must pass in
shameful haste by Domenico Veneziano and his supposed murderer Andrea
del Castagno. Domenico was called from Perugia (1439) to paint murals in
Santa Maria Nuova; he had as aide a promising youth from Borgo San
Sepolcro — Piero della Francesca; and in these works — now lost — he
made one of the earliest Florentine experiments with paints mixed in
oil. He has left us one masterpiece — the Portrait of a Woman (Berlin)
with upswept hair, wistful eyes, obtrusive nose, and bulging bosom. Ac-
cording to Vasari, Domenico taught the new technique to Andrea del
Castagno, who was also painting murals in Santa Maria Nuova. Rivalry may
have marred their friendship, for Andrea was a dour and passionate man;
Vasari tells how he murdered Domenico; but other records relate that
Domenico outlived Andrea by four years. Andrea reached fame by his
picture of the scourging of Christ, in the cloister of Santa Croce,
where his tricks of perspective astonished even his fellow artists.
Hidden away in the old monastery of Sant’ Apollonia in Florence are his
imaginary por - traits of Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Farinata degli
Uberti, a vivid repre- sentation of the swashbuckler Pippo Spana, and a
Last Supper (1450) that seems poorly drawn and lifeless, but may have
suggested an idea or two to Leonardo none the less.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>A MISCELLANY</li>
</ol>
<p>To feel with any vividness the life of art in Cosimo’s Florence we
must not only contemplate those major geniuses whom we have here
commemo- rated so hurriedly. We must enter the side streets and alleys
of art and visit a hundred shops and studios where potters shaped and
painted clay, or glassmakers blew or cut glass into forms of fragile
loveliness, or gold-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 107</p>
<p>smiths fashioned precious metals or stone into gems and medals, seals
and coins, and a thousand ornaments of dress or person, home or church.
We must hear noisy intent artisans beating or chasing iron, copper, or
bronze into weapons and armor, vessels and utensils and tools. We must
watch the cabinet makers designing, carving, inlaying, or surfacing
wood; engravers cutting designs into metal; and other workers chiseling
chimney pieces, or tooling leather, or carving ivory, or producing
delicate textiles to make flesh seductive or adorn a home. We must enter
convents and see patient monks illuminating manuscripts, placid nuns
stitching storied tapestries. Above all we must picture a population
developed enough to understand beauty, and wise enough to give honor,
sustenance, and stimulus to those who consumed themselves in its
making.</p>
<p>Metal engraving was one of the inventions of Florence; and its Guten-
berg died in the same year as Cosimo. Tommaso Finiguerra was a worker in
niello — i.e., he cut designs into metal or wood, and filled the
cavities with a black compound of silver and lead. One day, says a
pretty story, a stray piece of paper or cloth fell upon a metal surface
just inlaid; removed, it was found imprinted with the design. The tale
has the earmarks of an after- thought; in any case Finiguerra and others
deliberately took such impres- sions on paper in order to judge of the
effect of the engraved patterns. Baccio Baldini {c. 1450), a Florentine
goldsmith, was apparently the first to take such impressions, from
incised metal surfaces, as a means of pre- serving and multiplying the
drawings of artists. Botticelli, Mantegna, and others supplied him with
designs. A generation later Marcantonio Rai- mondi would develop the new
technique of engraving into a means of broadcasting all but the color of
Renaissance paintings to the world.</p>
<p>We have kept for the last a man who defies classification, and can
best be understood as the embodied synthesis of his time. Leon Battista
Alberti lived every phase of his century except the political. He was
born in</p>
<p>Venice of a Florentine exile, returned to Florence when Cosimo was
re- called, and fell in love with its art, its music, its literary and
philosophical coteries. Florence responded by hailing him as almost a
monstrously per- fect man. He was both handsome and strong; excelled in
all bodily ex- ercises; could, with feet tied, leap over a standing man;
could, in the great cathedral, throw a coin far up to ring against the
vault; amused himself by taming wild horses and climbing mountains. He
was a good singer, an eminent organist, a charming conversationalist, an
eloquent orator, a man of alert but sober intelligence, a gentleman of
refinement and courtesy, generous to all but women, whom he satirized
with unpleasant persistence</p>
<p>108 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>and possibly artificial indignation. Caring little about money, he
com- mitted the care of his property to his friends, and shared its
income with them. “Men can do all things if they will,” he said; and
indeed there were few major artists in the Italian Renaissance who did
not excel in several arts. Like Leonardo half a century later, Alberti
was a master, or at least a skilled practitioner, in a dozen fields —
mathematics, mechanics, architec- ture, sculpture, painting, music,
poetry, drama, philosophy, civil and canon law. He wrote on nearly all
these subjects, including a treatise on painting that influenced Piero
della Francesca and perhaps Leonardo; he added two dialogues on women
and the art of love, and a famous essay on “The Care</p>
<p>He composed a comedy, Philodoxus, in such idiomatic Latin that no one
doubted him when, as a hoax on his time, he passed it off as the newly
dis- covered work of an ancient author; and Aldus Manutius, himself a
scholar, printed it as a Roman classic. He wrote his treatises in chatty
dialogue form, and in “bare and simple” Italian so that even a busy
businessman might read him. His religion was rather Roman than
Christian, but he was always a Christian when he heard the cathedral
choir. Looking far ahead, he expressed the fear that the decline of
Christian belief would plunge the world into a chaos of conduct and
ideas. He loved the countryside around Florence, retired to it whenever
he could, and made the title character of his dialogue T eogenio
say:</p>
<p>The society of the illustrious dead can be enjoyed by me at
leisure</p>
<p>here; and when I choose to converse with sages, statesmen, or great
poets, I have but to turn to my bookshelves, and my company is</p>
<p>better than any that your palaces can afford with all their crowd
of</p>
<p>clients and flatterers.</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RISE OF THE MEDICI 109</p>
<p>Cosimo agreed with him, and found no greater solace in his old age
than his villas, his intimates, his art collection, and his books. He
suffered se- verely from gout, and in his final years left the internal
affairs of the state to Luca Pitti, who abused the opportunity to add to
his wealth. Cosimo’s own fortune had not been diminished by his numerous
charities; he whim- sically complained that God kept always a step ahead
of him in returning his benefactions with interest. 52 In his country
seats he applied himself to the study of Plato, under the tutelage of
his protege Ficino. When Cosimo lay dying it was on the authority of
Plato’s Socrates, not on that of Christ, that Ficino promised him a life
beyond the grave. Friends and enemies alike grieved over his death
(1464), fearing chaos in the government; and almost the entire city
followed his corpse to the tomb that he had com- missioned Desiderio da
Settignano to prepare for him in the church of San Lorenzo.</p>
<p>Patriots like Guicciardini, angered by the conduct of the later
Medici, thought of him as Brutus thought of Caesar; 58 Machiavelli
honored him as he honored Caesar. 54 Cosimo had overthrown the Republic,
but the freedom he had checked was the liberty of the rich to rule the
state with factious violence. Though he sullied his record with
occasional cruelty, his reign was by and large one of the most genial,
peaceful, and orderly periods in the history of Florence; and the other
was that of the grandson who had been trained by his precedents. Rarely
had any prince been so wisely generous, or so genuinely interested in
the advancement of man- kind. “I owe much to Plato,” said Ficino, “but
to Cosimo no less; he</p>
<p>reali zed for me the_ virtues of which Plato gave me the conception.”
55 Under him the humanist movement flowered; under him the diverse
genius of Donatello, Fra Angelico, and Lippo Lippi received bountiful
encourage- ment; under him Plato, so long overshadowed by Aristotle,
returned into the mindstream of humanity. When a year had passed after
Cosimo’s death, and time had had a chance to dull his glory and reveal
his faults, the Florentine Signory voted to inscribe upon his tomb the
noblest title it could confer: Pater Patriae, Father of His Country. And
it was deserved. With him the Renaissance lifted its head; under his
grandson it reached its purest excellence; under his great-grandson it
conquered Rome. Many sins may be forgiven to such a dynasty.</p>
