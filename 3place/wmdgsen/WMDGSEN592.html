<h4 id="chapter-xxii">CHAPTER XXII</h4>
<p>Science in the Age of Galileo</p>
<p>1558-1648</p>
<p>I. SUPERSTITION*</p>
<p>R eligions are bom and may die, but superstition is immortal.
Only</p>
<p>. the fortunate can take life without mythology. Most of us suffer in
body and soul, and Nature’s subtlest anodyne is a dose of the
supernatural. Even Kepler and Newton mingled their science with
mythology: Kepler believed in witchcraft, and Newton wrote less on
science than on the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Popular superstitions were beyond number. Our ears burn when others
speak of us. Marriages made in May will turn out unhappily. Wounds can
be cured by anointing the weapon with which they were inflicted. A
corpse resumes bleeding in the presence of the murderer. Fairies, elves,
hobgoblins, ghosts, witches, demons lurk everywhere. Certain talismans
(e.g., those found on Catherine de Medicis after her death) guarantee
good fortune. Amulets can ward off wrinkles, impotence, the evil eye,
the plague. A k ing’s touch can cure scrofula. Numbers, minerals,
plants, and animals have magic qualities and powers. Every event is a
sign of God’s pleasure or wrath, or of Satan’s activity. Events can be
foretold from the shape of the head or the lines of the hands. Health,
strength, and sexual power vary with the waxing and waning of the moon.
Moonshine can cause lunacy and cure warts. Comets presage disasters. The
world is (every so often) coming to an end.*</p>
<p>Astrology, though increasingly repudiated by the literate, was
still</p>
<p>popular. In 1572 its teaching ceased in the University of Bologna; in
1582 the Spanish Inquisition denounced it; in 1586 Pope Sixtus V warned
Cath- olics against it; but in the University of Salamanca it persisted,
on and off, till 1770. The great majority of the people, and many in the
upper classes, solicited horoscopes foretelling the future from the
position of the stars. All babies of any consequence had their
horoscopes cast soon after birth. An astrologer was hidden near the
bedchamber of Anne of Austria at the birth of Louis XIV.* When Gustavus
Adolphus was born his father,</p>
<p>Charles IX, asked Tycho Brahe for a horoscope; the astronomer
cautiously predicted that the boy would become king. Kepler doubted
astrology, but • For superstition, science, and philosophy in England in
this period cf. Chapter VII.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>buttered some bread with it, saying, “As every animal has been given
by nature some means of getting a living, so the astronomer has been
furnished with astrology in order to enable him to live.”® Wallenstein
paid for a favorable horoscope in 1609 and regularly took an astrologer
with him on his travels,^ perhaps to encourage his troops. Catherine de
Medicis and her court repeatedly consulted astrologers.® John Dee
enjoyed a high reputa- tion as astrologer until he discovered that the
position of the stars required that one of his pupils must exchange
wives with him.®</p>
<p>The belief in magical arts was declining, with a bloody exception:
this period was the heyday of judicial murders for witchcraft.
Persecutors and persecuted alike believed in the possibility of securing
supernatural aid by incantations or similar devices. If one could win
the intercession of a saint by prayer, why not the help of a devil by
courting him? A book pub- lished at Heidelberg in 1585, Christlich
Bedenken . . . von Zauberei (Chris- tian Ideas on Magic ) , laid i t
down as an axiom that “everywhere the whole universe, inward and
outward, water and air, is full of devils, of wicked, invisible
spirits.”’^ It was a common belief that human beings could be
“possessed” by devils entering them. In 1593 there was “a te rrible
panic in the little town of Friedeberg, for it was said that the Devil
had taken bodily possession of more than sixty people . . . and had
tortured them frightfully. . . . Even the pastor . . . had himself been
seized . . . while preaching.”® Th e story of the Gadarene swine (Matt.,
viii, 28-34) pictured Christ as driving demons from possessed persons;
and had he not given to his followers the power to cast out devils in
his name (Mark, xvi, 17)? Priests were called upon by their parishioners
for a variety of exorcisms — to drive pests from the fields, to still
storms at sea, to cleanse a building of evil spirits, to purify a
desecrated church, etc.; Pope Paul V issued in 1604 a manual for such
priestly services. Protestant writers condemned sacer- dotal exorcism as
magic, but the Church of England has recognized the value of exorcism as
a healing rite.® Here, as in so many ceremonies, the psychological
effect has been good.</p>
<p>Just as the people took the initiative in asking for exorcisms, so
they were the prime movers in demanding the prosecution of “witches.”
Fear of the power of witches was widespread. Said a pamphlet of 1563:
“To enter into relations with the Devil, to have him close at hand in
rings or crystals, to conjure him, to enter into alliance with him, to
carry on hundreds of magic arts with him, is more in vogue nowadays,
among both high and low, learned and unlearned, than ever before.”
“Devil books” explaining how to get in touch with helpful demons were
popular; one man sold 1,220 of them at two fairs in 1568.’® In some
cases the officers of the Roman Inquisition advised parish priests to
“instruct the people in the fallacies of witchcraft,”</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>Pope Gregory XV (1623) required the death penalty for persons
convicted of causing death by sorcery; but Urban VIII (1637) condemned
Catholic Inquisitors “on account of their arbitrary and unjust
prosecution of sorcer^ ers, . . . extorting from the accused . . .
confessions that were valueless, and abandoning them to the secu lar arm
without sufficient cause.”^* Emperor Maximilian II decreed (1568) that
those convicted of sorcery should have their confesaons tested by
challenges to perform magic in public; and the supreme penalty, after
three convictions, was to be banishment. But the frightened populace
demanded severity in examinations and haste in execu- tions.</p>
<p>Civil and ecclesiastical authorities, sharing, or wishing to allay,
this fear of witches, subjected the accused to rigorous trials, often
using torture to elicit confessions. At Nordlingen the town council had
a special set of torture instruments, which it lent to neighboring
communities with the assurance that “by these means, and more especially
by the thumbscrew, God has often been graciously pleased to reveal the
truth, if not at first, at any rate at the last.”^® Torture by
preventing sleep was one of the milder methods. Usually the desired
admissions were obtained by torture, and the judges were only
occasionally disturbed by the unreliability of such confessions.</p>
<p>The persecutions were least severe in Spain. In the province of
Logrono the Inquisition convicted fifty-three persons of witchcraft and
put eleven to death (1610); otherwise the accusations were usually
dismissed as fanci- ful or vengeful, and executions for witchcraft were
rare. In 1614 the Suprema of the Inquisition issued instructions to its
officials to regard witch- craft confessions as neurotic delusions and
to show lenience in punish- ments.^^</p>
<p>An epidemic of witchcraft fears swept southeast France in 1609. Hun-
dreds of persons believed themselves possessed by devils; some thought
themselves changed into dogs, and barked. A commission of the Bordeaux
Parlement was appointed to try suspects. A method was devised to
discover the spots at which devils had entered the body of the accused:
he was blindfolded, needles were stuck into his flesh, and any place
where he failed to feel the injected point was judged to be the port of
entry. Hoping to be pardoned, suspects accused one another. Eight were
convicted, five escaped, three were burned; and spectators swore later
that they had seen devils, in the form of toads, issuing from the heads
of the victims.^® In Lorraine 800 were burned for witchcraft in sixteen
years; in Stras- bourg 134 in four days (October 1582).^® In Catholic
Lucerne 62 were put to death between 1562 and 1572; in Protestant Bern,
300 in the last decade of the sixteenth century, 240 in the first decade
of the seven- teenth.^’’</p>
<p>In Germany Catholics and Protestants competed in sending witches
to</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>the stake. It is incredibly and yet reliably reported that the
Archbishop of Trier had 120 persons burned at Pfalz in 1596 on the
charge that they had made the cold weather last devilishly long.^® A
cattle plague in the Schongau district (1598) was ascribed to witches;
the Bavarian Privy Council at Munich urged inquisitors to “show more ear
nestness and severity in your proceedings”; in consequence 63 witches
were burned, and the relatives of the victims were required to pay the
cost of the trials.^® At Hamburg, in Austria, 80 were executed for
sorcery in the two years</p>
<p>1617-18. In 1627-29 the Bishop of Wurzburg is said to have put 900
witches to death.®® In 1582 Protestant editors reissued, with their
approval, the Malleus malefic arum {Hammer of Witches) which the
Dominican In- quisitor Jakob Sprenger had published in 1487 to guide in
the detection and prosecution of witches. Elector Augustus of Saxony
decreed (1572) that witches were to be burned to death even if they had
injured no one. In Ellingen 1,500 witches were burned in 1590, in
Ellwangen 167 in 1612, in Westerstetten 300 in two years;®^ there were
similar ecstasies in Osnabriick in 1588, in Nbrdlingen in 1590, in
Wiirttemberg in 1616; these latter sta- tistics, however, are derived
from contemporary newssheets notorious for inaccuracy. German scholars
estimate a total of 100,000 executions for witchcraft in Germany in the
seventeenth century.®®</p>
<p>There were a few voices calling men to reason. We have noted
elsewhere the protests of Johann Wier and Reginald Scot, and we have
seen how Montaigne turned his skeptical humor upon the mania in the
essay “Of the Lame or Crippled”: “How much more natural and likely do I
find</p>
<p>it that two men should lie, than that one man in twelve hours should
be carried by the winds from East to West, . . . 〔or〕 that one of us
should be carried on a broom through … a chimney.”®® People who believe
such things need medicine, not death. “When all is done, it is an
overvaluing of one’s conjectures, by them to cause a man to be burned
alive.”®* Cornelius Loos, a Catholic professor at Mainz, attacked
witch-hunting in his Vber die wahre und falsche Magie (1592), but before
he could publish it he was im- prisoned and compelled to recant his
errors.®® Another Jesuit, the Pietist poet Friedrich von Spee, after
serving as confessor to nearly 200 persons accused of witchcraft,
denounced the persecution in a brave book, Cautio criminalis (1631): he
admitted the existence of witches, but he deplored the arrests on
baseless suspicion, the unfairness of the trials, the merciless tortures
that would have forced the “doctors and bishops of the Church” to
confess to anything.®*</p>
<p>For every such opponent there were a dozen defenders of the
oppression. Protestant theologians like Thomas Erastus, in 1572, and
Catholic theolo- gians like Bishop Peter Binsfeld, in 1589, agreed that
witchcraft was real and that witches should be burned. The Bishop
approved of torture, but</p>
<p>CHAP. XXTl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>recommended that repentant witches should be strangled before being
burned.<sup>’</sup> The Catholic lawyer and philosopher Jean Bodin
upheld the persecution in his Demonomanie (1580); a year later the
Protestant poet Johann Fischart translated and expanded this book with
gusto, and joined Bodin in urging a relentless severity.^®</p>
<p>Nevertheless the mania waned. After 1632, when the Thirty Years’ War
became frankly political, religion ceased to hold so warm a place in
men’s hates. Printing was spreading, books were multiplying, schools
were re- covering, new universities were opening. Year after year
patient plodders brought a stone to the rising pyramid of knowledge, and
in a hundred cities curious men tested hypotheses with experiments.
Slowly the area of the supernatural shrank, the sphere of the natural
and secular grew. It is a dull, impersonal, fragmentary history, and the
greatest drama of mod- ern times.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE</li>
</ol>
<p>The first heroes here are the printer-publishers who fed the inky
stream on which knowledge flowed from mind to mind and from generation
to generation. The great publishing house of the Estiennes was continued
in Geneva by Henri Estienne II, and in Paris by Robert Estienne III. A
similar dynasty was founded at Leiden (c. 1580) by Louis Elzevir; his
five sons, his grandsons, and a great-grandson carried on his work and
gave their name to a style of type. At Zurich Christopher Froschauer
earned a place in the history of printing and scholarship by his careful
editions of the Bible.</p>
<p>Libraries were providing new homes for old treasures. We have noted
the Bodleian at Oxford, the library of the Escorial, the exquisite
Biblioteca Am- brosiana at Milan (1606). Catherine de Medicis added many
volumes and manuscripts to what is now the Bibliotheque Nationale. The
new Vatican Li- brary of Sixtus V (1588) seemed to Evelyn ’’the most
nobly built, furnished, and beautiful of any in the world.”^®</p>
<p>Newspapers were sprouting. As far back as 1505 single-sheet Xeitungen
(tidings) had been sporadically printed in Germany; by 1599 there were
877 such publications, all irregular. The oldest regular newssheet known
to history was the weekly Avisa Relation oder Zeitung founded at
Augsburg in 1609 and composed from reports of agents posted throughout
Europe by mer- chants and financiers. The Frankfurt Oberpostamzeitung,
founded in 1616, con- tinued publication till 1866. Similar regular
weeklies began in Vienna in 1610, in Basel in 16 ii. Soon Fischart was
making fun of th e “newspaper - believing” public and its credulous
avidity for news. The inadequate and biased trans- mission of news, and
the profitable dissemination of nonsense, barred the general public from
any intelligent or concerted participation in politics, and made
democracy impossible.</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>Censorship of publications was practically universal in Christendom,
Cath- olic and Protestant, ecclesiastical and secular. The Church set up
in 1571 the Congregation of the Index to guard the faithful against
books considered injurious to Catholic belief. Protestant censorship was
not as powerful and severe as the Catholic, but it was as sedulous; it
flourished in England, Scotland, Scandinavia, Holland, Germany, and
Switzerland.®® The diversity of dogmas in different states allowed
heretics in some measure to defeat the censorship by publishing their
books abroad and importing copies clandestinely. Modern literature owes
something of its wit and subtlety to censorship.</p>
<p>In divers translations, but always interpreted as the word of God,
the Bible continued its career as the most popular of all books and the
most influential in doctrine and language, even in conduct, for the
worst brutalities of the time — wars and persecutions — quoted Scripture
in self- justification. As the humanist Renaissance receded before the
theological Reformation, the idolatry of the pagan classics was replaced
by worship of the Bible. A commotion was caused when scholars discovered
that the New Testament was written not in classical Greek but in the
Koine of the populace; but the theologians explained that the Holy Ghost
had used the common diction to be better understood by the people.
Another heartache came when Louis Cappel, Protestant professor of Hebrew
and theology at Saumur, concluded that the vowel points and accents in
the canonically accepted Hebrew text of the Old Testament were additions
made to older texts by the Masorete Jews of Tiberias in or after the
fifth cen- tury B.C., and that the square characters of the accepted
text were Aramaic substitutes for Hebrew letters. Johannes Buxtorf the
Elder, the greatest Hebraist of the time, begged Cappel to withhold
these views from the public as in- jurious to belief in the verbal
inspiration of the Bible. Cappel published never- theless (1624);
Johannes Buxtorf the Younger tried to refute him, and argued that the
points and the accents were also divinely inspired. The controversy
continued through the century; orthodoxy finally yielded the points, and
a modest step was taken toward appreciating the Bible as the majestic
expression of a people.</p>
<p>Some of the most famous scholars in history belong to these years.
Justus Lipsius, oscillating between Louvain and Leiden and between
Catholicism and Protestantism, earned European fame by his corrective
editions of Tacitus, Plautus, and Seneca, and surpassed all previous
grammars with his Aristarchus^ sive De arte grammatica (1635). mourned
the imminent death of European civilization, and warmed himself with
“the sun of another new empire arising in the west” — the
Americas.®^</p>
<p>Joseph Justus Scaliger, “perhaps the most extraordinary master of
general erudition that has ev er lived,”®^ inherited from his famous
father, Julius Caesar Scaliger, the throne of European scholarship. At
Agen, in southwestern France,, he served his father as amanuensis, and
absorbed learning with every breath. He read Homer in three weeks and
marched triumphantly through all the major Greek poets, historians, and
orators. He learned Hebrew, Arabic, and eight other languages, ventured
into mathematics, astronomy, and “philosophy”“ (which then included
physics, chemistry, geology, and biology), and for</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>581</p>
<p>three years studied law. His legal training may have helped to
sharpen his critical teeth, for in the editions that he issued of
Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, and other classical authors he raised
textual criticism from haphazard surmises to laws of procedure and
interpretation. He had a wise respect for dates in the understanding of
history; his greatest work, De emendatione temporum (On the Correction
of DateSy 1583), for the first time collated the dates given by Greek
and Latin historians with those given or indicated in the history,
calen- dars, literature, and astronomy of Egypt, Babylonia, Judea,
Persia, and Mexico. His Thesaurus temporum (1606) collected and arranged
every chronological item in classical literature; and on this foundation
he established the first scien- tific chronology of ancient history. It
was he who suggested that Jesus was born in 4 b.c. When Justus Lipsius
left Leiden in 1590, the university offered its chair of classical
scholarship to Scaliger. After three years of hesitation he accepted;
and thereafter, till his death in 1609, Leiden was the Olympus of
savants.</p>
<p>Scaliger, like his father, was vain of their family’s sup posed
descent from the della Scala princes of Verona, and he was acidly
critical of fellow scholars; but in a forgetful moment he called Isaac
Casaubon “the most learned of living men .”^3 Casaubon’s career explored
the uses of adversity. He was born at Geneva because his Huguenot
parents had fled from France. They returned to France when he was three,
and for sixteen years he lived amid the alarms and terrors of
persecution. His father was absent for long periods of service in
Huguenot armies; his family often hid in the hills from fanatical bands
of armed Catholics; he received his first Greek lessons in a cave in the
moun- tains of Dauphin6. At nineteen he entered the Academy of Geneva;
at twenty- two he became its professor of Greek; for fifteen years he
held that post through poverty and siege. He could barely live on his
salary, but he skimped on food to buy books, and he comforted his
scholastic loneliness with kindly letters from the great Scaliger. He
issued editions of Aristotle, Pliny the Younger, and Theophrastus, which
captivated the learned world not merely by textual emendations but by
illuminating notes on ancient ideas and ways. In 1596, when Henry IV had
eased the theological strife, Casaubon was ap- pointed to a
professorship at Montpellier. Three years later he was invited to Paris,
but the university had closed its doors to non-Catholics, and Henry had
to take care of him as curator of the Biblioth^ue Royale, at the
comfortable salary of 1,200 livres per year. The economical Sully told
the scholar, “You cost the King too much, sir: your pay exceeds that of
two good captains, and you are of no use to your country.”^^ When the
great Henry died, Isaac thought it time to accept an invitation from
England. James I welcomed him as a fellow scholar and gave him a pension
of £^00 a year. But the French Queen Regent refused to let his books
follow him, the King pestered him with disquisitions, the London wits
could not forgive him for not talking English. After four years in
England he gave up the battle (1614) at the age of fifty-five, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>In that age the title of scholar was honored above that of poet or
historian, for the scholar was revered as one whose patient learning
preserved and</p>
<p>582</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>clarified the wisdom and beauty hiding in ancient literature and
philosophy. Scaliger, entering Leiden, was hailed like a conquering
prince. Claude de Saumaise, known to the world of scholarship as
Salmasius, was desired of many nations; after Casaubon’s death he was by
common consent “the most learned of all who are now living” and, in
general, “the miracle of the world.”^® What had he done? Bom in
Burgundy, educated — and converted to Calvinism — at Heidelberg, he
shone forth, at the age of twenty, with a scholarly edition of two
fourteenth-century writers on the controverted primacy of the popes,
and, a year later, with an edition of Flonis’ Epitome, Work after work
fol - lowed, thirty in all, marked by all-embracing erudition. He
reached his peak with a tremendous folio of nine hundred double-column
pages, Exercitationes in , Solini Polyhistora (1629). Solinus, a
third-century grammarian, had brought together the history, geography,
ethnology, economy, fauna, and flora of all the major countries of
Europe in an encyclopedic work which a later editor christened
Polyhistor; upon this text Salmasius hung notes covering with cosmic
erudition the whole world of Imperial Rome. Choosing among a dozen
invitations, he accepted a professorship at Leiden, where he was at once
made head of a brilliant faculty. All went well until Charles II of
England, then an exile in Holland, engaged him to write a condemnation
of Cromwell for beheading Charles I. His Defensio regia pro Carolo I
appeared (November</p>

<li>only ten months after the execution. Cromwell did not enjoy it; he
hired the greatest poet in England to answer it; we shall hear of it
again. Salmasius wrote a reply to Milton, but died (1653) before
completing it, and Milton took the credit for killing him.</li>

<p>With so much learning in a few, probably eighty per cent of the
people in Western Europe were still illiterate. John Comenius spent
forty years seeking to improve the educational systems of Europe. Bom in
Moravia (1592), rising to be a bishop of the Moravian Brethren, he never
lost his faith in religion as the basis and end of education; there
could be no wisdom without the fear of God. Though his life was made an
odyssey of tribulation by the religious hatreds of his time, he remained
true to the tolerant philosophy of the Unitas Fratrum:</p>
<p>We are all citizens of one world, we are all of one blood. To
hate</p>
<p>a man because he was born in another country, because he speaks</p>
<p>a different language, or because he takes a different view on this
sub- ject or that, is a great folly. Desist, I implore you, for we are
all</p>
<p>equally human. . . . Let us have but one end in view, the welfare
of</p>
<p>humanity; and let us put aside all selfishness in considerations of
lan- guage, nationality, or religion.^®</p>
<p>After writing half a hundred pedagogical texts, he summarized his
principles in Didactica magna (1632), one of the landmarks in the
history of education. First, education should be universal, regardless
of sex or means: every village should have a school, every city a
.^ollege, every province a university; ad- vancement to higher education
sh*. ..id be made possible for all who show</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 583</p>
<p>themselves fit; the state must finance the discovery, training, and
utilization of all the ability in its population. Second, education
should be realistic: ideas should at every step be kept in touch with
things; words in the vernacular or in a foreign language should be
learned by seeing or touching or using the objects they represent;
grammatical instruction should come later. Third, edu- cation should be
physical as well as mental and moral; children should be trained in
health and vigor through outdoor life and sports. Fourth, education
should be practical: it should not stay in the prison of thought, but
should be accompanied by action and practice and should prepare for the
business of living. Fifth, more and more science should be taught with
the advancing age of the student; schools of scientific research should
be established in every city or province. Sixth, all education and
knowledge should be directed to im- pjroving character and piety in the
individual and order and happiness in the state.</p>
<p>Some progress was made. The German princes labored to establish an
elementary school in every village. The principle of universal
compulsory edu- cation was proclaimed by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar in 1619
for all boys and girls from six to twelve years of age,^<em>^ with a
month’s vacation at harvest time, and by 1719 this system had been
established throughout Germany. Sec- ondary schools were still closed to
women, but they multipled and improved. Twenty-two new universities were
opened in this age.</em> Oxford was flourishing, as described by
Casaubon in 1613; he was impressed by the remuneration and the social
standing of the teachers there, as compared with their analogues on the
Continent. Professors in Germany (1600) were so poorly paid that many of
them sold beer and wine to eke out a living; at Jena the students
caroused in taverns maintained by professors.^® Spanish universities
declined after Philip II, withering under the glare of the Inquisition;
meanwhile several universities were founded in Spanish America — at Lima
in 1551, at Mexico City in 1553, long before the establishment of
Harvard College in 1636. The prospering Dutch organized six universities
in this period. When Leiden successfully resisted Spanish siege (1574),
the States-General of the United Provinces invited the citizens to name
their reward; they asked for a university; it was so ordered. In
Catholic and Calvinist countries education was controlled by
ecclesiastics; in England and Lutheran lands it was largely administered
by clergymen controlled by the state. In nearly all universities except
Padua teachers and students were required to accept the official
religion, and academic freedom was strictly limited by both the state
and the Church. Religious differences put an end to the international
character of the universities; Spanish students were confined to Spain,
English students no longer entered the University of Paris, and Oxford
continued till 1871 to exact from every candidate for a degree assent to
the Thirty-nine Articles of the Established Church. Originative</p>

<p>thought tended to disappear from universities and to find refuge in
private academies and noninstitutional studies.</p>
<p>So, in this age, private academies arose uncensored for study and
research, especially in science. At Rome in 1603 Federigo Cesi, Marquis
of Montebello, founded the Accademia dei Lincei (Academy of the
Lynx-eyed), which Galileo joined in 1611. Its constitution defined its
aim:</p>
<p>The Lincean Academy desires as its members philosophers who are</p>
<p>eager for real knowledge, and will give themselves to the study
of</p>
<p>nature, especially mathematics; at the same time it will not
neglect</p>
<p>the ornaments of elegant literature and philology, which, like
graceful garnets, adorn the whole body of science. … It is not within
the</p>
<p>Lincean plan to find leisure for recitations and debates. . . .
The</p>
<p>Linceans will pass over in silence all political controversies and
every kind of quarrels and wordy disputes.-“*®</p>
<p>The academy was dissolved in 1630, but its purposes were carried on
(1657) by the Accademia del Cimento (trial and proof). Soon similar
societies were to be formed in England, France, and Germany, and the
inspiring International of Science would lay the intellectual and
technical foundations of the modern world.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE TOOLS AND METHODS OF SCIENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>First there had to be scientific instruments. The eyes could not
see</p>
<p>clearly enough, far enough, minutely enough; the flesh could not feel
with requisite accuracy the pressure, warmth, and weight of things; the
mind could not measure space, time, quantity, quality, density without
mingling its personal equation with the facts. Microscopes were needed,
telescopes, thermometers, barometers, hydrometers, better watches, finer
scales. One by one they came.</p>
<p>In his Magia naturalis (1589) Giambattista dell a Porta wrote,
“With</p>
<p>a concave lens things appear smaller but plainer; with a convex lens
you see them larger but less distinct; if, however, you know how’’ to
combine the two sorts properly, you will see near and far both large and
clear.’’^® Here was the principle of the microscope, the field glass,
the opera glass, the telescope, a whole hatful of inventions, and all
histology. The simple micro- scope, a single convex lens, had long been
known. The invention that trans- formed biology was the compound
microscope combining several con- verging lenses. The industry of
grinding and polishing lenses was especially developed in the
Netherlands — Spinoza lived and died by it. About 1590 Zacharias
Janssen, a spectacle-maker of Middelburg, combined a double convex lens
and a double concave lens to make the earliest known com-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 585</p>
<p>pound microscope. From that invention came modern biology and modem
medicine.</p>
<p>A further application of these principles transformed astronomy. On
October 2, 1608, another spectacle-maker of Middelburg, Hans Lipper-
shey, presented to the States-General of the United Provinces (still at
war with Spain) the description of an instrument for seeing objects at a
distance. Lippershey had placed a double convex lens (the “object
glass”) at the</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on principles known to Hero of Alexandria in or before the
third century a.d., Galileo had invented a thermometer (c. 1603). Into a
vessel of water he placed the open end of a glass tube whose other end
was an empty glass bulb, which he warmed by the touch of his hand; when
he withdrew his hand the bulb cooled and water rose in the tube.
Galileo’s friend Giovanni Sagredo (1613) marked off the tube into a
hundred</p>
<p>degrees.</p>
<p>A pupil of Galileo, Evangelista Torricelli, closed a long glass tube
at</p>
<p>one end, filled it with mercury, and stood it with its open end
submerged in a dish of mercury; the mercury in the tube did not flow
down into the dish. Scholastic physics explained this as due to
“Nature’s abhorrence of a vacuum”; Torricelli explained it as due to the
pressure of the surrounding atmosphere upon the mercury in the dish. He
reasoned that this outside pressure would raise the mercury in the
vessel into an empty tube freed from air; experiment proved him right.
He showed that variations in the height of the mercury in the tube could
be used as a measure of variations in atmospheric pressure. So in 1643
he constructed the first barometer — still the basic instrument of
meteorology.</p>
<p>Armed with these new tools, the sciences called to mathematicians for
improved methods of calculation, measurement, and notation. Napier and
Bvirgi, as we have seen, responded with logarithms, Oughtred with the
slide rule; but a greater boon came with the decimal system. Tentative
sugges- tions, as usual, had prepared the way. Al-Kashi of Samarkand
(d. 1436) had expressed the ratio of the circumference of a circle to
the diameter as</p>
<p>586</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>3 1415926535898 732, which is a decimal using a space instead of a
point. Francesco Pellos of Nice in 1492 used a point. Simon Stevinus ex-
pounded the new system in an epochal treatise, The Decimal (1585), in
which he offered to “teach with unheard -of ease how to perform all cal-
culations … by whole numbers without fractions.” The metric system in
Continental Europe carried out his ideas in the measurement of lengths,
volumes, and currencies; but the circle and the clock paid tribute to
Babylonian mathematics by retaining a sexagesimal division.</p>
<p>Gerard Desargues published in 1639 a classic treatise on conic
sections. Frangois Viete of Paris revived the languishing study of
algebra by using letters for known as well as unknown quantities, and he
anticipated Descartes by applying algebra to geometry. Descartes
established analytical geometry in a flash of inspiration when he
proposed that numbers and equations can be represented by geometrical
figures and vice versa (so the progressive depreciation of currency in a
course of time can be shown as a statistical graph); and that from an
algebraic equation representing a geometrical figure consequences can be
algebraically drawn which will prove geometrically true; algebra could
therefore be used to solve difficult geometrical problems. Descartes was
so charmed with his discoveries that he thought his geometry as far
superior to that of his predecessors as the eloquence of Cicero was
above the A B C of children.^* His analytical geometry, Cavalieri’s
theory of indivisibles (1629), Kepler’s approximate squaring of the
circle, and the squaring of the cycloid by Roberval, Tor- ricelli, and
Descartes all prepared Leibniz and Newton to discover calculus.</p>
<p>Mathematics was now the goal as well as the indispensable tool of all
the sciences. Kepler observed that when the mind leaves the realm of
quantity it wanders in darkness and doubt.*® “Philosophy,” said Galileo,
meaning “natural philosophy,” or science,</p>
<p>is written in this grand book of the universe, which stands
continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless
we first learn to comprehend the language and read the letters in which
it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics.**</p>
<p>Descartes and Spinoza longed to reduce metaphysics itself to
mathematical form.</p>
<p>Science now began to liberate itself from the placenta of its mother,
philosophy. It shrugged Aristotle from its back, turned its face
from</p>
<p>metaphysics to Nature, developed its own distinctive methods, and
looked to improve the life of man on the earth. This movement belonged
to the heart o f the Age of Reason, but it did not put its faith in
“pure reason” — reason independent of experience and experiment. Too
often such reason-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>ing had woven mythical webs. Reason, as well as tradition and
authority, was now to be checked by the study and record of lowly facts;
and what- ever “logic” might say, science would aspire to accept only
what could be quantitatively measured, mathematically expressed, and
experimentally proved.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>SCIENCE AND MATTER</li>
</ol>
<p>The sciences advanced in logical progression through modern history:
mathematics and physics in the seventeenth century, chemistry in the
eighteenth, biology in the nineteenth, psychology in the twentieth.</p>
<p>The great name in the physics of this period is Galileo, but many
lesser heroes merit remembrance. Stevinus helped to determine the laws
of the pulley and the lever; he made valuable studies in water pressure,
the center of gravity, the parallelogram of forces, and the inclined
plane; and at Delft, about 1690, he anticipated Galileo’s alleged
experiment at Pisa by showing, contrary to immemorial belief, that when
two like objects of however different weight are let fall together from
a height they reach the ground at the same time.^® Descartes laid down
quite clearly the law of inertia — that a body persists in its state of
rest or in rectilinear motion unless affected by some external force. He
and Gassendi anticipated the molecular theory of heat. He based his
Meteores (1637) on a cosmology no longer accepted, but the treatise did
much to establish meteorology as a science. Torricelli (1642) extended
his studies of atmospheric pressure to the mechanics of winds; these, he
held, were the equalizing currents set up by local differences in the
density of the air. Gassendi, that remarkable priest of all sciences,
carried on experiments for measuring the speed of sound; his results
gave 1,473 feet per second. His friar friend, Marin Mer- senne, repeated
the experiment and reported 1,380 feet, closer to the cur- rent figure
of 1,087. Mersenne, in 1636, established the whole series of overtones
produced by a sounding string.</p>
<p>Research in optics centered on the complex problems of reflection and
refraction, especially as seen in the rainbow. About 1591 Marco Antonio
de Dominis, Archbishop of Spalato, composed a treatise, De radiis vims
et lucis . . . et hide (published 161 1 ), in which he explained the
formation of the primary rainbow (the only one generally visible) as due
to two</p>
<p>refractions and one reflection of light in drops of moisture in sky
or</p>
<p>spray, and that of the secondary rainbow (an arc of colors, in
reversed order, sometimes faintly seen outside the primary bow) as due
to two refractions and two reflections. In 1611 Kepler’s Dioptrice
studied the refraction of light by lenses; and ten years later
Willebrord Snell of Leides</p>
<p>588</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXH</p>
<p>formulated the laws of refraction with a precision that made possible
a more accurate computation of the action of lenses on light and the
construc- tion of better microscopes and telescopes. Descartes applied
these laws to a mechanical calculation of radiation angles in the
rainbow. Explanation of the color arrangement had to wait for
Newton.</p>
<p>Gilbert’s epochal discussion of terrestrial magnetism s et off a
train of theories and experiments. Famianus Strada, of the Society of
Jesus, sug- gested telegraphy (1617) by proposing that two men might
communicate through a distance by utilizing the sympathetic action of
two magnetic needles made to point simultaneously to the same letter of
the alphabet. Another Jesuit, Niccolo Cabeo (1629), gave the first known
description of electrical repulsion. Still another, Athanasius Kircher,
described in his Magnes (1641) a measurement of magnetism by suspending
a magnet from one pan of a balance and counterpoising its influence by
weights in the other. Descartes ascribed magnetism to the conflict of
particles thrown off by the great vortex from which he believed the
universe had evolved.</p>
<p>Alchemy was still popular, especially as a royal substitute for
debasing the currency. Emperor Rudolf II, the electors of Saxony,
Brandenburg, and the Palatinate, the Duke of Brunswick, the Landgrave of
Hesse, all engaged alchemists to manufacture silver or gold.^® From
these experi- ments, from the needs of metallurgy and the dyeing
industry, and from the emphasis of Paracelsus on chemical medicine, the
science of chemistry was taking form. Andreas Libavius personified the
transition. His Defense of Transmutatory Alchemy (1604) continued the
old quest, but his</p>
<p>Alchymia (1597) was the first systematic treatise on scientific
chemistry. He discovered stannic chloride, was the first to make
ammonium sulfate, was among the first to suggest blood transfusions as
therapy. His laboratory at Coburg was one of the wonders of the city.
Jan Baptista van Helmont, a wealthy nobleman who devoted himself to
science and the medical service of the poor, placed his name among the
founders of chemistry by distin- guishing gases from air and analyzing
their varieties and composition; he coined the word gas from the Greek
chaos. He made many discoveries in his chosen field, ranging from the
explosive gases of gunpowder to the inflammatory possibilities of human
wind.^^ He suggested the use of alkalis to correct undue acidity in the
digestive tract. Johann Glauber recommended crystalline sodium sulfate
as “a splendid medicine for internal and external</p>
<p>All these “natural sciences” shared in improving industrial
production and martial slaughter. Technicians applied the new knowledge
of move- ments and pressures in liquids and gases, the composition of
forces, the laws of the pendulum, the course of projectiles, the
refining of metals.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>589</p>
<p>Gunpowder was used in mine blasting (1613). In 1612 Simon Sturtevant
devised a method of producing coke — i.e., “coking” (cooking or heating)
bituminous coal to rid it of volatile ingredients; this coke was
valuable in metallurgy, as the impurities in coal affected iron; it
replaced charcoal and saved forests. The making of glass was cheapened,
hence windowpanes became common in this age. Mechanical inventions
multiplied as industry grew, for they were due less frequently to the
researches of scientists than to the skill of artisans anxious to save
time. So we first hear of the screw lathe in 1578, the knitting frame in
1589, the revolving stage in 1597, the threshing machine and the
fountain pen in 1636.</p>
<p>Engineers were accomplishing feats that even today would merit ad-
miration. We have seen how Domenico Fontana aroused Rome by erecting an
obelisk in St. Peter’s Square. Stevinus, as engineer for Maurice of</p>
<p>Nassau, developed a system of sluices to control the dykes — guardian
of the Dutch Republic. Giant bellows ventilated mines; complicated pumps
raised water into towers to give pressure for houses and fountains in
cities like Augsburg, Paris, and London. Truss bridges were built on the
simple geometrical principle that a triangle cannot be deformed without
changing the length of a side. In 1624 a submarine traveled two miles
under water in the Thames.<em>® Jerome Cardan, Giambattista della Porta,
and Salopion de Cans advanced the theory of the steam engine; Cans in
1615 described a machine for raising water by the expansive power of
steam.</em>®</p>
<p>Geology was still unborn, even as a word; the study of the earth was
called mineralogy, and respect for the Biblical story of Creation
checked all ventures in cosmogony. Bernard Palissy was denounced as a
heretic for reviving the ancient view that fossils were the petrified
remains of dead organisms. Descartes ventured to suggest that the
planets, including the earth, had once been glowing masses, like the
sun, and that as the planet cooled it formed a crust of liquids and
solids over a central fire, whose exhalations produced geysers,
volcanoes, and earthquakes.®®</p>
<p>Geography progressed as missionaries, explorers, and merchants strove
to extend their faith, their knowledge, or their sales. Spanish
navigators (i567f) explored the South Seas and discovered Guadalcanal
and others of the Solomon Islands — so named in the hope of finding
there Solomon’s mines. Pecho Paes, a Portuguese missionary, taken
prisoner in Abyssinia (1588), visited the Blue Nile and solved an
ancient riddle by showing that the periodic inundations of the Nile
Valley were due to the rainy season in the Abyssinian highlands. Willem
Janszoon was apparently the first European to touch Australia (1606),
and Abel Tasman discovered Tasmania, New Zealand (1642), and the Fiji
Islands (1643). Dutch</p>
<p>traders entered Siam, Burma, and Indochina, but information about
these countries and China came chiefly from Jesuit missionaries. Samuel

<p>plain, under orders of Henry IV of France, explored the coast of Nova
Scotia and ascended the St. Lawrence River to the vicinity of Montreal.
His followers founded Quebec and charted the lake that bears his
name.</p>
<p>The mapmakers struggled to keep not too far behind the explorers.</p>
<p>Gerardus Mercator (Gerhard Kremer) studied at Louvain and established
there a shop for making maps, scientific instruments, and celestial
globes. In 1544 he was arrested and prosecuted for heresy, but escaped
serious consequences; however, he thought it prudent to accept an
invitation to the University of Duisburg, where he became cartographer
to the Duke of Julich-Cleves (1559). In his life of eighty-two years he
labored tirelessly to map Flanders, Lorraine, Europe, the earth. His
famous Nova et acuta terrae descriptio ad usum navigantium accomodata
(1568) introduced the “Mercator’s projection” maps, which facilitated
navigation by representing all meridians of longitude as parallel to one
another, all parallels of latitude as straight lines, and both sets of
lines at right angles to each other. In 1585 he began to issue his great
Atlas (we owe this use of the word to him), containing fifty-one
regional maps of unprecedented precision and accuracy, describing the
whole earth as then known. His friend Abraham Oertel rivaled him with a
comprehensive Theatriim or bis terrarum (Ant- werp, 1570). Together
these men freed geography from its millennial bondage to Ptolemy and
established it in its modern form. Because of them the Dutch maintained
almost a monopoly on mapmaking for a century. v. SCIENCE AND LIFE</p>
<p>Biology had still to wait two centuries for its heyday. Botany
grew</p>
<p>leisurely through medical studies of curative herbs and the
importation of exotic plants into Europe. Jesuit missionaries brought in
Peruvian bark (quinine) , vanilla, and rhubarb. About 1 560 the potato
was introduced from Peru to Spain whence it spread across the Continent.
Prospero Alpini, pro- fessor of botany at Padua, described fifty foreign
plants newly cultivated in Europe. From his studies of the date palm he
deduced the doctrine of sexual reproduction in plants, which
Theophrastus had expressed in the third century b.c. “The female date
trees,” said Alpini, “do not bear fruit unless the branches of the male
and female plants are mixed together, or, as is generally done, unless
the dust found in the male sheath or male flowers is sprinkled over the
female flowers.”®* Linnaeus would lat er classify plants according to
their mode of reproduction; but meanwhile (1583) Andrea Cesalpino of
Florence offered the first systematic classification of plants — 1,500
of them — on the basis of their different seeds and fruits. Gaspard
Bauhin, of Basel, in his massive Pinax theatri botanici (1623),</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>classified 6,000 plants, anticipating Linnaeus’ binomial nomenclature
by genus and species. Bauhin devoted forty years to preparing this Table
of the Botanic World, and he died a year after its publication. It
remained for three centuries a standard text.</p>
<p>The private herbariums of physicians were now evolving into botanical
gardens maintained for the public by universities or governments. The
earliest, established at Pisa in 1543, achieved renown under Cesalpino;
Zurich had one in 1560, then Bologna, Cassel, Leiden, Leipzig, Breslau,
Basel, Heidelberg, Oxford. Gui de La Brosse, physician to Louis
XIII,</p>
<p>organized the famous Jardin des Plantes Medicinales at Paris in 1635.
Zoological gardens, as menageries for public amusement, had existed in
China (1100 B.c.), ancient Rome, and Aztec Mexico (c. 1450); modern
forms were opened at Dresden in 1554 and under Louis XIII at
Versailles.</p>
<p>Zoology received less attention than botany, as it offered — except
in mythical medicine — fewer cures. Ulisse Aldrovandi began in 1599 the
publication of thirteen great tomes on “natural history”; he lived to
see six through the press; the Senate of Bologna published the remaining
seven from his manuscripts and at public cost; they were superseded only
by the Histoire naturelle (1749-1804) of Buffon. The Jesuit polymath
Athan- asius Kircher began histology with his Ars magna lucis et umbrae
(1646), in which he described the minute “worms” that his microscope had
found in decaying substances. The belief in the spontaneous generation
of tiny organisms out of rotten flesh — or even out of slime — ^was
still almost universal, though Harvey was soon to reject it in his De
generatione ani- malium (1651). Zoology was backward partly because only
a few</p>
<p>thinkers saw in animals the progenitors of men. But in 1632 Galileo
wrote to the Grand Duk e of Tuscany: “Though the differences between man
and the other animals is enormous, one might say reasonably that it is
little more than the difference among men themselves.”®^ The modern mind
was slowly climbing back to what the Greeks had known two thousand years
before.</p>
<p>Anatomy was resting after its labors under Vesalius. Dissection of
ca- davers was still opposed — as by Hugo Grotius®® — ^but the numerous
“anat - omy lessons” in Dutch art re flect a general acceptance of the
procedure. The great name here, as well as in surgery, is Girolamo
Fabrizio d’Acqua - pendente, pupil of Fallopio and teacher of Harvey.
During his reign at the University of Padua the great anatomical theater
was built there — the only such structure still completely preserved
from that era. His dis- covery of the valves in the veins and his
studies of the effect of ligatures led to Harvey’s demonstration of the
circulation of the blood. Knowledge of circulation of b ody fluids was
advanced by Gasparo Aselli’s discovery of the lacteals (1632), lymphatic
vessels carrying milklike chyle from</p>
<p>59^ the age of reason begins (chap. XXII</p>
<p>the small intestine. Indeed, Aselli, despite his name (“the little
ass”) de - scribed the circulation of the blood six years before Harvey
published his theory. Andrea Cesalpino had expounded the essential
theory in 1571, half a century before Harvey; he still clung to the old
view that some blood passes through the septum of the heart, but he came
closer than Harvey to explaining — by capillamenta — how the blood finds
its way from the arteries to the veins. On a hundred fronts the noblest
of all armies was advancing in the greatest of all wars.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>SCIENCE AND HEALTH</li>
</ol>
<p>In that war for the conquest of knowledge the central battle is
that</p>
<p>of life against death — a battle which individually is always lost
and collec- tively is regularly won. In fighting disease and pain the
physicians and the hospitals had many human enemies; personal
uncleanliness, public filth, noisome prisons, quacks with magical
potions, “scientific” mystics, hernia setters, stone melters, cataract
couchers, tooth drawers, amateur uroscop- ists. And new diseases ran a
race with new cures.</p>
<p>Leprosy had disappeared, and protective devices had reduced syphilis;
Fallopio had invented (1564) a linen sheath against such infection.
(This soon came to be used as a contraceptive and was sold by barbers
and bawds.®^) But epidemics of typhus, typhoid fever, malaria,
diphtheria, scurvy, influenza, smallpox, and dysentery appeared in
several countries of Europe in this period, especially in Germany.
Probably exaggerated figures report 4,000 deaths from a plague of boils
in Basel in 1 563-64; twenty-five per cent of the inhabitants of

deliberate poisoning; at Frankenstein, in Silesia, seventeen persons
were burned to death on suspicion of “strewing poison.”®“ In 1604 the
bubonic plague was so severe in Frankfurt am Main that there were not
enough people to bury the dead.®“ These are palpable exaggerations; but
we are told, on good authority, that in a recurrence of the bubonic
plague in Italy, 1629- 31, Milan lost 86,000 and “no less than 500,000
died in the Venetian Republic. . . . Between 1630 and 1631 there were
1,000,000 victims of the plague in northern Italy alone.”®® The
fertility of women barely kept up with the resourcefulness of death.

<p>education was taking a more rigorous form — though one could still
practice medicine without a degree. Bologna, Padua, Basel, Leiden,
Montpellier, Paris had famous medical schools drawing students from all
Western Europe. We have a peculiar example of patient medical research
in the thirty years of experiment by which Sanctorius tried to reduce
physiolog- ical processes to quantitative measurement. He did much of
his work while sitting at a table on a large scale; he recorded the
changes in his weight from the intake and the outlet of solids and
liquids, and he even weighed his sweat. He found that the human body
gives off several pounds daily through normal perspiration, and
concluded that this is a vital form of elimination. He invented a
clinical thermometer (1612) and a pulsimeter as aids to diagnosis.</p>
<p>Therapy was graduating from toads to leeches. Some reputable physi-
cians prescribed dried toads, sewn in a bag and hung on the breast, as a
trap to catch and absorb the poisonous air that surrounded the body in
plague areas.®® Bloodletting by leeches or cupping was combined with
plentiful drinking of water, on the theory that some of the intaken
fluid would form fresh uninfected blood. Two schools of treatment
contended for the victim: the iatromechanical, stemming from Descartes’
teaching that all bodily processes are mechanical; and the
iatrochemical, originating with Paracelsus, developed by Helmont, and
interpreting all physiology as chemical. Hydrotherapy was popular.
Curative waters were taken at England’s Bath, the Netherlands’ Spa,
France’ s Plombieres, and a dozen places along the Rhine and in Italy;
we have seen Montaigne trying them and shedding stones on the way. New
drugs like valerian (c. 1580),</p>
<p>antimony (c. 1603), ipecac (1625), and quinine (1632) were introduced
to Europe. The London pharmacopoeia of 1618 listed 1,960 drugs. Mon-
taigne tells of special treats which a few doctors kept for patient
patients:</p>
<p>the left foot of a tortoise, the urine of a lizard, an elephant’s
dung,</p>
<p>a mole’s liver, blood drawn from the right wing of a white
pigeon,</p>
<p>and, for us who have the stone . . . the pulverized droppings of a
rat; and such other tomfooleries that are more suggestive of magic
and</p>
<p>spells than of a serious science.®^</p>
<p>Such delicacies were impressively expensive, and people in the
seventeenth century moaned over druggists’ charges more than over
doctors’ bills.*® Dentistry was left to barbers and consisted almost
entirely of extractions. The “barber - surgeons” now included skilled
practitioners like Ambroise Pare, Fran9ois Rousset, who revived the
Caesarean section, and Gasparo Tagliacozzi, specialist in the plastic
reconstruction of ears, noses, and lips. He was condemned by moralists
for interfering with the handiwork of</p>
<p>594</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xxn</p>
<p>God; his corpse was exhumed from consecrated ground and was buried in
unhallowed soil.*® Wilhelm Fabry, “father of German surgery,” was the
first to recommend amputation of a limb above the diseased part; and
Giovanni Colle of Padua gave the oldest known description of a blood
transfusion (1628).</p>
<p>As in every age, the patients resented the doctor’s fees; the
comedians laughed at his long robe, red shoes, and bedside gravity. If
we trust</p>
<p>the satires of the comic dramatists, his social status was not much
above that of the teacher; but when we note the history of Rembrandt’s
Anatomy Lesson we perceive a class of men holding a respected position
in society and able to pay well for even a share in a great picture. And
the most famous philosopher of the age, dreaming like all of us of a
better future for mankind, thought of this as depending upon the
improvement of human character, and of medical science as the likeliest
agent of this basic revolution. “For even the mind,” said Descartes,
“depends so much on the temperament and disposition of the bodily organs
that if it is possible to find some means by which men might commonly be
made wiser and abler … I believe it is in medicine that it ought to be
looked for.”®*</p>

<li>FROM COPERNICUS TO KEPLER</li>
</ol>
<p>We have left astronomy to the last, for its heroes come toward
the</p>
<p>end of this period and constitute its pieces de rhistance.</p>
<p>The same Church that was to silence Galileo led the way in a
major</p>
<p>achievement of modem astronomy — the reform of the calendar. The re-
vision that Sosigenes had made for Caesar about 46 b.c. had
overestimated the year by eleven minutes and fourteen seconds;
consequently, by 1577 the Julian calendar lagged behind the progress of
the seasons by some twelve days, and ecclesiastical feasts had fallen
out of the season for which they had been intended. Several attempts at
calendar reform had been made — under Clement VI, Sixtus IV, and Leo X —
^but difficulties had been found in securing general agreement and
requisite astronomical knowledge. In 1576 a revised calendar drawn up by
Luigi Giglio was presented to Gregory XIII. The Pope submitted it to a
commission of theologians, lawyers, and scientists, including the
Bavarian Jesuit Christopher Clavius, famous in mathematics and
astronomy; the final draft was apparently his work. Long negotiations
were carried on with princes and prelates to secure their co-operation;
many objections were made, and the effort to win the consent of the
Eastern churches failed. On Febraary 24, 1582, Gregory XIII signed the
bull that established the Gregorian calendar in Roman- Catholic lands.
To equate the old calendar with astronomic realities, ten</p>

<p>days were to be omitted in October 1582, the fifth was to be
accounted the fifteenth, and complicated allowances were to be made for
the</p>
<p>reckoning of interest and other commercial relations. To offset the
error in the Julian calendar, only such century years as are divisible
by 400 were to have a twenty-ninth day in February. Protestant nations
resisted the change; in Frankfurt am Main and Bristol the populace
rioted in the belief that the Pope wished to rob it of ten days; even
Montaigne, avid of time, complained, “The eclipsing or abridging of ten
days, which the Pope</p>
<p>hath lately caused, hath taken me so low that I can hardly recover
my- self.”®® But slowly the new calendar — ^which would need no further
correc- tion for 3,333 years — ^won acceptance: by the German states in
1700, England in 1752, Sweden in 1753, Russia in 1918.*</p>
<p>A similar lag occurred in the acceptance of the Copernican astronomy.
In Italy it might be studied and taught if presented as hypothesis
rather than demonstrated fact;®* Giordano Bruno defended it, and
Campanella already wondered whether the inhabitants of other planets
thought themselves, as earthlings do, the center and purpose of all
things.®^ Generally, Protestant theologians vied with Catholic in
denouncing the new system. Bacon and Bodin alike repudiated it.®® More
surprising was its rejection by the greatest astronomer of the half
century that followed Copernicus ’ death (1543).</p>
<p>Tycho Brahe was bom in 1 546 in the then Danish province of Scania,
now the southern extremity of Sweden. His father was a member of the
Danish Council of State; his mother was mistress of the robes of the
Queen. His rich Uncle Jorgen, disconsolately childless, abducted him,
wheedled the parents into consent, and gave the boy every advantage of
education. At thirteen Tycho entered the University of Copenhagen. Ac-
cording to Gassendi, he was drawn to astronomy when he heard a teacher
discuss a forthcoming eclipse of the sun. He watched the eclipse come as
predicted, and marveled at the science that had reached such prophetic
power. He bought a copy of Ptolemy’s Almagest, pored over it to the</p>
<p>At sixteen he was transferred to the University of Leipzig, where
he</p>
<p>studied law by day and the stars by night. He was warned that this
regimen would lead to physical and nervous breakdown. Tycho persisted,
and he spent his allowance on astronomical instruments. In 1565 his
uncle died, leaving him a large fortune. After settling his business
affairs, Tycho hur-</p>
<p>• Ideally the calendar would have thirteen months, each of twenty
-eight days, with a dateless holiday (or, in leap years, two) at the
close of the year. Such a one-page calendar, with rotary devices to
indicate the month and the year, could serve for every month
indefinitely; each day of the week would fall on the same dates every
month and every year; the business year would be evenly divisible into
equal months and equal quarters. But, alas, this would confuse the
saints.</p>
<p>59^ THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XXll</p>
<p>ried to Wittenberg for more mathematics and astronomy; thence, driven
by plague, to Rostock. There he fought a duel and had part of his nose
cut off; he ordered a bright new nose of silver and gold and wore it the
rest of his life. He dabbled in astrology and predicted the coming death
of Suleiman the Magnificent, only to find that the Sultan had already
died.*® After much travel in Germany he returned to Denmark, busied
himself with chemistry, and was brought back to astronomy by discovering
a new star in the constellation Cassiopeia (1572). His carefree
observations of this transitory star and his account of it in his first
publication, De nova Stella, gave him a European reputation, but shocked
some great Danes, who considered authorship a form of exhibitionism
incompatible with blue blood. Tycho confounded them by marrying a
peasant girl. He</p>
<p>seems to have felt that a simple housewife was the best mate for an
absorbed astronomer and was the best match open to a man with a golden
nose.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with astronomical facilities in Copenhagen, he set out
for Cassel, where Landgrave William IV had built (1561) the first
observatory with a revolving roof, and Joost Biirgi had developed a
pendulum clock which made possible an unprecedented accuracy in timing
the observation and movements of stars. Fired with new zeal, Tycho went
back to Copen- hagen and interested Frederick II in projects for an
observatory. The King gave him the island of Hveen (Venus) in the Sound,
and a good pension. With this and his own means Tycho built there a
castle and gardens which he called Uraniburg (Heavenly City), with
living quarters, library, lab- oratory, several observatories, and a
workshop to make his own instru- ments. He had no telescope;
twenty-eight years were to pass before its invention; yet it was his
observations that guided Kepler to epochal dis- coveries.</p>
<p>In twenty-one years at Hveen Tycho and his pupils gathered a body</p>
<p>of data exceeding in extent and accuracy anything hitherto known. He
took records of the sun’s apparent motion every day for many years. He
was one of the first astronomers to allow for the refraction of light
and the fallibility of observers and instruments; so he repeated the
same observation time and again. He discovered and reduced to law the
varia- tions in the motion of the moon. His meticulous tracing of a
comet in 1577 led him to the now universally accepted belief that
comets, instead of being generated in the earth’s a tmosphere, are true
celestial bodies moving in fixed and regular courses. When Tycho
published his catalogue of 777 stars, and marked them with loving care
on the great celestial globe in his library, he had justified his
life.</p>
<p>In 1588 Frederick II died. The new King was a boy of eleven; the</p>
<p>regents who ruled him were not as patient with the pride, temper,
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>extravagance of Brahe as Frederick had been; soon the governmental
grants ran low, and in 1597 they ceased. Tycho left Denmark and settled
in Benatek Castle, near Prague, as the guest of Emperor Rudolf II, who
looked to him for astrological predictions. Brahe imported his
instruments and records from Hveen, and advertised for an assistant.
Johann Kepler came (1600), and worked fitfully but devotedly for his
difficult master. Just as Brahe was hoping to develop his massive
accumulation of data into a reasoned theory of the heavens, he was
struck down at table by a burst bladder. He lingered in pain for eleven
days, and died (1601) mourn- ing that he had not completed his work. The
funeral orator said that he had “coveted nothing but time.”^®</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>KEPLER: 1571-1630</li>
</ol>
<p>It turned out well for science that Tycho moved to Prague, for there
Kepler inherited his observations, and deduced from them the planetary
laws that prepared for Newton’s theory of gravitation. From Brahe to
Kepler to Newton and from Copernicus to Galileo to Newton are the basic
and converging lines of modern astronomy.</p>
<p>Kepler was born at Weil, near Stuttgart, son of an army officer
who</p>
<p>repeatedly went off to war as preferable to domesticity. Returning at
last, the father opened a tavern, in which Johann served as a waiter.
The boy was sickly; smallpox crippled his hands and permanently impaired
his vision. The Duke of Wiirttemberg saw in him the possibility of a
good preacher and paid for his education. At Tubingen Michael Maestlin,
who as professor taught the Ptolemaic astronomy, privately converted
Kepler to the Copernican theory, and the youth became so enthusiastic
about the stars that he abandoned all thought of an ecclesiastical
career.</p>
<p>After taking his degree he became a schoolmaster at Graz, in Styria,
teaching Latin, rhetoric, and mathematics for 1 50 gulden a year, with
free lodging, and adding twenty gulden by editing annually an
astrological calendar. At twenty-five he married a woman of twenty-three
who had buried one husband and divorced another; she brought him a dowry
and a daughter; he added six children in due course. A year after his
marriage he was forced as a Protestant to leave Graz (1597), for the new
Archduke of Styria, Ferdinand, was a resolute Catholic who ordered all
Protestant clergymen and teachers out of Styria. Kepler had given
further offense by publishing Mysterium cosmographicum (1596), ardently
advocating the Copernican system; hopefully he sent copies to Brahe and
Galileo. After a year of despondent poverty he was saved by Tycho’s
invitation to Prague. But Tycho was hard to get along with; there were
difficulties with religion</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>598</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>and bread; the wife developed epilepsy. Then Tycho died, and Kepler
was appointed his successor, at five hundred florins a year.</p>
<p>Brahe had bequeathed his records to him, but not his instruments.
Unable to buy the best, Kepler found himself driven to study Brahe’s
observations rather than add to them. He could never hav e said with
Newton, “I do not invent hypotheses”; on the contrary, his head hummed
with them; “I have much store of fantasy His peculiar skill lay in
testing hypotheses, and his wisdom lay in casting them aside when the
consequences that he had mathematically deduced from them proved
incompatible with the observed phenomena.^- In seeking to plot the orbit
of Mars he tried seventy hypotheses through four years.</p>
<p>Finally (1604) he reached his basic and epochal discovery — ^that the
orbit of Mars around the sun is an ellipse, not a circle as astronomers
from Plato to and including Copernicus had supposed; only an elliptical
orbit harmonized with the repeated observations of Brahe and others.
Kepler’s agile mind leaped to the question. What if all the planetary
orbits are elliptical? Rapidly he tested the idea with the recorded
observations; it agreed with them almost completely. In a Latin treatise
on the motions of Mars, Astronomia nova de motibus stellae Martis
(1609), he published the first two of “Kepler’s laws”: first, each
planet moves in an elliptical orbit, in which one focus is the sun;
second, each planet moves more rapidly when near the sun than when
farther from it, and a radius drawn from the sun to the planet covers,
in its motion, equal areas in equal times. Kep- ler ascribed the
differences in planetary speed to the greater emanation of solar energy
felt by the planet as it neared the sun; in this connection he evolved
from Gilbert an idea of magnetic attraction closely akin to</p>
<p>Newton’s theory of gravitation.</p>
<p>When Emperor Rudolf died (1612) Kepler moved to Linz, and again</p>
<p>he lived by teaching school. His wife having passed away, he married
a poor orphan girl. In providing his new home with wine he was
fascinated by the difficulty of measuring the contents of a cask with
curved sides; the essay that he published on the problem helped to
prepare the discovery of infinitesimal calculus.</p>
<p>After puzzling for ten years over the relation between the speed of a
planet and the size of its orbit, Kepler published, in his book The
Harmony of the World (1619), his third law: the square of the time of
revolution of a planet around the sun is proportioned to the cube root
of its mean dis- tance from the sun. (For examp le: Mars’s time of
revolution is demon - strably 1.88 times that of the earth; the square
of this is 3.53; the cube root of this is 1.52; i.e., the mean distance
of Mars from the sun will be 1.52 times that of the earth from the sun.)
Kepler was so overjoyed by having reduced the behavior of the planets to
such order and regularity that he</p>
<p>CHAP, xxn)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>likened each orbital speed to a note on a musical scale, and
concluded that the combined motions make a “harmony of the spheres,”
which, however, is audible only to the “soul” of the sun. Kepler mingled
mysticism with his science, illustrating again Goethe’s generous saying
that a man’s defects are the faults of his time, while his virtues are
his own. We can forgive the pride that wrote, in the preface to The
Harmony of the World:</p>
<p>What I promised my friends in the title of this book. . . . what,</p>
<p>sixteen years ago, I urged as a thing to be sought — that for
which</p>
<p>I joined Tycho Brahe, … to which I have devoted the best part</p>
<p>of my life — I have at length brought to light. … It is not
eighteen</p>
<p>months since the unveiled sun . . . burst upon me. Nothing holds
me;</p>
<p>I will indulge my sacred fury. … If you forgive me, I rejoice; if
you</p>
<p>are angry I can bear it. The die is cast, the book is written, to be
read either now or by posterity, I care not which; it may well wait a
cen-</p>
<p>tury for a reader, as God has waited six thousand years for a
dis-</p>
<p>coverer!^®</p>
<p>In an Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy ( 1 6 1 8-2 1 ) Kepler
showed how his laws supported, clarified, and amended the Copernican
system. “I have attested it as true in my inmost soul,” he said, “and I
contemplate</p>
<p>He shared the prevailing belief in witchcraft. His mother was charged
with practicing it; witnesses alleged that their cattle, or they
themselves, had become ill because Frau Kepler had touched them; one
witness swore that her eight-year- old daughter had been made ill by
Mother Kepler’s witchery, and she threatened to kill the “witch” if she
did not at once cure the girl. The accused woman denied all guilt, but
she was arrested and chained in a cell. Kepler fought for her at every
stage of the proceedings. The state’s attorney proposed that a co
nfession be drawn from her by tor- ture. She was taken to the torture
chamber and was shown the instruments to be used upon her; she still
asserted her innocence. After thirteen months’ imprisonment she was
released, but she died soon afterward (1622).</p>
<p>This tragedy, and the impact of the spreading war, darkened Kepler’s
final years. In 1620 Linz was occupied by Imperialist troops, and its
in- habitants neared starvation. Through all the chaos he continued his
labor of formulating the observations of Brahe, others, and himself, in
the Rudol-</p>

<p>phine tables (1627), which catalogued and charted 1,005 ^nd re-</p>
<p>mained standard for a century. In 1626 he moved to Ulm. His Imperial
salary fell far in arrears, and he was hard pressed to feed his family.
He applied to Wallenstein for employment as astrologer; he was engaged,
and for some years he followed the general, casting horoscopes for him
and publishing astrological almanacs. In 1630 he went to Regensburg to
appeal to the Diet for the arrears of his salary. The effort consumed
his last phys- ical resources; he was seized with fever and died within
a few days</p>
<p>(November 15, 1630), in the fifty-ninth year of his age. All traces
of</p>
<p>his grave were swept away by the war.</p>
<p>His function in the history of astronomy was to mediate between
Coper- nicus and Newton. He advanced beyond Copernicus by replacing
circular with elliptical orbits, by abandoning eccentrics and epicycles,
and by plac- ing the sun not at the center of a circle but at one focus
of an ellipse. By these changes he freed the Copernican system from many
of the diffi- culties that had almost justified Tycho Brahe in rejecting
it; through him the heliocentric view now won a rapidly widening
acceptance. He trans- formed what had been a brilliant guess into a
hypothesis worked out in impressive mathematical detail. He provided
Newton with the planetary laws that led to the theory of gravitation.
While keeping his religious faith fervent and undiminished, he revealed
the universe as a structure of law, as a cosmos of order in which the
same laws ruled the earth and the stars. “My wish,” he said, “is that I
may perceive the God whom 1 find eve ry- where in the external world in
like manner within me.”^®</p>

<p>Galileo Galilei was born at Pisa on the day of Alichelangelo’s death
(Feb - ruary 18, 1564), in the same year as Shakespeare. His father was
a cultured Florentine, who shared in teaching him Greek, Latin,
mathematics, and music. Not for nothing was Galileo an almost exact
contemporary of Monteverdi (1567-1643); music was one of his perennial
consolations, especially in his blind old age; he played the organ
creditably and the lute well. He liked to draw and paint, and sometimes
he regretted that he had not become an artist. In that wonderful Italy
of his youth the flame of the Renaissance still burned, inspiring men to
be complete. He mourned that he could not design a temple, carve a
statue, paint a portrait, write poetry, compose music, guide a ship;’^
he longed to do all of these; and we feel.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 6oi</p>
<p>as we contemplate him, that he lacked only time. Such a man, under
differ- ent accidents, could have been any kind of great man. Whether by
nature or by circumstance, he turned in boyhood to making and playing
with machines.</p>
<p>At seventeen he was sent to the University of Pisa to study medicine
and philosophy. A year later he made his first scientific discovery —
that the swings of a pendulum, regardless of their width, take equal
times. By lengthening or shortening the arm of a pendulum he could
retard or quicken the rate of oscillation until it synchronized with his
pulse; by this “pulsilogia” he could accurately measure his
heartbeat.</p>
<p>About this time he discovered Euclid. He overheard a tutor teaching
geometry to the pages of the Grand Duke of Tuscany; the logic of</p>
<p>mathematics seemed to him immeasurably superior to the Scholastic and
Aristotelian philosophy that he had received in the classroom; clandes-
tinely, with Euclid’s Elements in his hand, he followed the lessons of
the instructor to the pages. The tutor took an interest in him and
taught him privately. In 1585 Galileo left the University of Pisa
without taking a</p>
<p>degree, moved to Florence, and, under the tutor’s guidance, gave
himself with passion to mathematics and mechanics. A year later he
invented a hydrostatic balance to measure the relative weights of metals
in an alloy, and won the praise of the Jesuit Clavius for an essay on
the center of gravity in solid bodies. Meanwhile his father’s means ran
out, and Galileo faced the obligation to earn his own bread. He applied
for teaching posts at Pisa, Florence, and Padua; he was rejected as too
young. In 1589, as he and a friend were planning to seek their fortunes
in Constantinople and the East, they heard that the chair of mathematics
at Pisa had fallen vacant. Galileo applied for it in forlorn hope; he
was still only twenty-five. He was given a three-year appointment, at
sixty scudi per year. On this he could starve, but he could show his
mettle.</p>
<p>He was mettlesome enough, for he began at once, from his professorial
chair, a war on the physics of Aristotle. According to the Greek
“the</p>
<p>downward movement of a mass of gold or lead, or of any other body en-
dowed with weight, is quicker in proportion to its size.”^® Lucretius’’*
and Leonardo da Vinci®“ expressed the same view. Even in antiquity Hip-
parchus (c. 130 B.c.) had questioned the opinion of Aristotle “on bodies
carried downward through weight”; and Joannes Philoponus (533 a.d.),
commenting on Aristotle, thought that the difference in time of fall be-
tween two objects one of which is twice the weight of the other will be
“either none at all or imperceptible.”®^ Here we come upon a famous and
disputed story. It appears first in an early biography of Galileo,
written by his friend Vincenzo Viviani in 1654 (twelve years after
Galileo’s death), and claiming to be founded on Galileo’s own verbal
account:</p>
<p>6o2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>To the dismay of all the philosophers, very many conclusions of</p>
<p>Aristotle were by him 〔Galileo〕 proved false through
experiments</p>
<p>and solid demonstrations … as, among others, that the velocity of</p>
<p>moving bodies of the same material, of unequal weight, moving</p>
<p>through the same medium, did not mutually preserve the proportion of
their weight as taught by Aristotle, but all moved at the same speed;
demonstrating this with repeated experiments from the height of the
Campanile of Pisa in the presence of the other teachers and philoso-
phers, and the whole assembly of students. . . . He upheld the dignity
of this professional chair with so great fame . . . that many
philoso-</p>
<p>phasters, his rivals, stirred with envy, were aroused against
him.®*</p>
<p>Galileo himself nowhere mentions the Pisa experiment in his extant
writ- ings; neither is it mentioned by two of his contemporaries who in
1612 and 1641 reported their own experiments in dropping objects of
diverse weight from the top of the Leaning Tower.®® Vivi ani’s story has
been rejected as a legend by some scholars in Germany and America.* Un-
certain, too, is the tradition concerning the resentment of fellow
professors at Pisa. He left that university in the summer of 1592,
probably because he had been offered a loftier chair at a better fee. In
September we find him installed at the University of Padua, teaching
geometry, mechanics, and astronomy, and turning his home into a
laboratory to which he in- vited his students and friends. He avoided
marriage, but took a mistress, who gave him three children.</p>
<p>Now he made the researches and experiments that he gathered together
only toward the end of his life in his Dialogues Concerning Two New
Sciences — ^i.e., concerning statics and dynamics. He affirmed the inde-
structibility of matter. He formulated the principles of the lever and
the pulley, and showed that the speed of freely falling bodies increases
at a uniform rate. He made many experiments with inclined planes; he
argued that an object rolling down one plane would rise on a similar
plane to a height equal to its fall if it were not for frictional or
other resistance; and he concluded to the law of inertia (Newton’s first
law of motion) — that a moving body will continue indefinitely in the
same line and rate of motion unless interfered with by some external
force.®^ He proved that a projectile propelled in a horizontal direction
would fall to the earth in</p>
<p>• Aristotle’s writings are often syncopated notes, which he probably
amplified or modified in lecturing. The passage in De Coelo may have
meant that in a resisting medium, includ- ing open air, objects or
concentrated mass, like a coin, fall faster than articles great in size
but small in weight, like a sheet of paper; this, of course, is true.
But in a vacuum the coin and the paper — or a ball of lead and a feather
— fall at the same speed; and even in the open air the paper, if
crumpled into a compact mass, falls at nearly the same speed as the
coin. If we note the modification in Viviani’s statement — that the
objects must be “of the same material . . . falling through the same
medium” — the divergence between the Athenian philosopher and the Pisan
scientist is much reduced.</p>

<p>a parabolic curve compounding the forces of impetus and gravity. He
reduced musical tones to wave lengths of air, and showed that the pitch
of a note depends upon the number of vibrations made by the struck
string in a given time. Notes, he taught, are felt as consonant and
harmonious when their vibrations strike the ear with rhythmic
regularity.®® Only those properties of matter belong to matter that can
be dealt with mathematically — extension, position, motion, density; all
other properties — ^sounds, tastes, odors, colors, and so on — “reside
only in consciousness; if the living crea - ture were removed, all these
qualities would be wiped away and annihi- lated.”®* He hoped that in
time these “secondary qualities” could be an - alyzed into primary
physical qualities of matter and motion, mathematically
measurable.®^</p>
<p>These were basic and fruitful contributions. They were hampered by
inadequacy of instruments; so, for example, Galileo underestimated the
factor of air resistance in the fall of objects and projectiles. But no
man since Archimedes had ever done so much for physics.</p>
<p>2 . The Astronomer</p>
<p>Toward the end of his stay in Padua he gave more and more of his</p>
<p>time to astronomy. In a letter (1596) to Kepler (seven years his
junior), thanking him for the Mysterkmt cosmographicum, he wrote:</p>
<p>I esteem myself happy to have as great an ally as you in my
search</p>
<p>for truth. … I will read your work … all the more willingly
because</p>
<p>I have for many years been a partisan of the Copernican view, and</p>
<p>because it reveals to me the causes of many natural phenomena that
are entirely incomprehensible in the light of the generally accepted</p>
<p>hypotheses. To refute the latter I have collected many proofs, but I
do not publish them, because I am deterred by the fate of our
teacher</p>
<p>Copernicus, who, though he had won immortal fame with a few, was
ridiculed and condemned by countless people (for very great is the</p>
<p>number of the stupid). I would dare to publish my speculations if</p>
<p>there were more people like you.®*</p>
<p>He professed his Copernican faith in a lecture at Pisa in 1 604. In 1
609 he made his first telescope, and on August 2 1 he demonstrated it to
Venetian ofiEcials. Hear his account:</p>
<p>Many of the nobles and senators, although of a great age, mounted
more than once to the top of the highest church in Venice 〔St.</p>
<p>Mark’s〕, in order to see sails and shipping … so far off diat it
was</p>
<p>6o4 the age of reason begins (chap, xxn</p>
<p>two hours before they were seen without my spyglass . . . , for
the</p>
<p>effect of my instrument is such that it makes an object fifty miles
off appear as large as if it were only five miles away. . . . The
Senate,</p>
<p>knowing the way in which I had served it for seventeen years at</p>
<p>Padua, . . . ordered my election to the professorship for life.®®</p>
<p>He improved his telescope until it magnified objects a thousand
times. Turning it to the sky, he was amazed to discover a new world of
stars, ten times as many as had yet been catalogued. Constellations were
now seen to contain a great number of stars invisible to the unaided
eye; so the Pleiades were seen to be thirty-six instead of seven and
Orion eighty instead of thirty-seven, and the Milky Way appeared not as
a nebulous mass but as a forest of stars great or small. The moon was no
longer a smooth surface, but a corrugation of mountains and valleys; and
the vague illumina- tion of its unsunned half could be explained as
partly due to sunshine reflected from the earth. In January i6io Galileo
discovered four of the nine “moons” or satellites of Jupiter; “these new
bodies,” he wrote,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems unbelievable, but Galileo, in a letter to Kepler, affirmed
that the professors at Padua refused to credit his discoveries, refused
even to look at the skies through his telescopes.®^ Tiring of Padua, and
hoping for a better intellectual climate in Florence (which was passing
from art to science), Galileo named the satellites of Jupiter the Sidera
Medicea after Cosimo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In March i6io he
dedicated to Cosimo a Latin treatise, Sidereus nuncius, summarizing his
astronomical revelations. In May he wrote to the Duke’s secretary a
letter warm with the ardor and pride of Leonardo’s appeal to the Duke of
Milan in 1482. He listed the subjects that he was studying and the books
in which he hoped to describe his results, and he wondered if he might
secure from his master an appointment that would require less time for
teaching and leave more for research. In June Cosimo named him “First
Mathematician of the University of Pisa, and First Mathematician and
Philosopher to the Grand Duke,” with an annual salary of a thousand
florins, and without obligation to teach. In September Galileo moved to
Florence, without his concubine.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 605</p>
<p>He had insisted on the title of philosopher as well as mathematician,
for he wished to influence philosophy as well as science. He felt as
Ramus, Bruno, Telesio, and others had done before him, as Bacon was
urging in this same decade, that philosophy (which he understood as the
study and interpretation of Nature in all its aspects) had gone to sleep
in the lap of Aristotle, and that the time had come to escape from these
forty Greek volumes and look at the world with loosened categories and
open eyes and mind. Possi bly he trusted too much to reason. “To
demonstrate to my op - ponents the truth of my conclusions, I have been
forced to prove them by a variety of experiments, though to satisfy
myself alone I have never felt it necessary to make many.”®^</p>
<p>He had the pride and pugnacity of an innovator, though at times he
spoke with a wise modesty — “I have never met a man so ignorant that I
could not learn something from him.”®* He was an ardent
controversialist, skilled to spear a foe on a phrase or roast him with
burning indignation. In the margin of a book by the Jesuit Antonio Rocco
defending the Ptole- maic astronomy, Galileo wrote, “Ignoramus,
elephant, fool, dunce . . . eunuch.”®^</p>
<p>But that was after the Jesuits had joined in condemning him. Before
his encounter with the Inquisition he had many friends in the Society of
Jesus. Christopher Clavius confirmed Galileo’s observations with his
own; an - other Jesuit lauded Galileo as the greatest astronomer of the
age; a com- mission of Jesuit scholars, appointed by Cardinal Bellarmine
to examine Galileo’s findings, reported favorably on all points.®® When
he went to Rome in i6i i the Jesuits entertained him at their Collegium
Romanum. “1 stayed with the Jesuit fathers,” he wrote; “they had verif
ied the actual existence of the new planets and had been constantly
observing them for two months; we compared notes, and I found that their
observations agreed exactly with my own.”®® He was welcomed by
dignitaries of the Church, and Pope Paul V assured him of his
unalterable good will.®^</p>
<p>In April he showed to prelates and scientists in Rome the results
of</p>
<p>observations that revealed spots on the sun, which he interpreted as
clouds. Apparently unknown to Galileo, Johannes Fabricius had already
announced their discovery in De maculis salts (Wittenberg, 1 6 1 1 ) and
had antic- ipated Galileo’s conclusion that the periodicity of the spots
indicated the rotation of the sun. In 1615 Christoph Scheiner, Jesuit
professor of</p>
<p>mathematics at Ingolstadt, addressed to Markus Welser, chief
magistrate of Augsburg, three letters in which he claimed to have
discovered the spots in April 1611. Galileo, back in Florence, received
from Welser a copy of Scheiner’s communications. He di scussed them in
Three Letters on the Solar Spots, published at Rome by the Accademia dei
Lincei in 1613. He claimed that he had observed the spots in 1610 and
had shown them to</p>
<p>6o6 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>friends in Padua. In the clash of claims to priority in discovering
the spots, the friendship between Galileo and the Jesuits cooled.</p>
<p>Convinced that his findings could be explained only on the Copemican
theory, Galileo began to talk of the theory as proved. The Jesuit
astron- omers had no objection to considering it as a hypothesis.
Scheiner sent his objections to the Copemican view to Galileo, with a
conciliatory letter. “If you wish to advance counterarguments,” he
wrote, “we shall in no way be offended by them, but will, on the
contrary, gladly examine your arguments in the hope that all this will
assist in the elucidation of the truth.”*® Many theologians felt that
the Copemican astronomy was so clearly incompatible with the Bible that
if it prevailed the Bible would lose authority and Christianity itself
would suffer. What would happen to the fundamental Christian belief that
God had chosen this earth as His human home — ^this earth now to be
shorn of its primacy and dignity, to be set loose among planets so many
times larger than itself, and among innu- merable stars.^</p>
<p>3 . On Trial</p>
<p>Galileo met the problem uncompromisingly. “Inasmuch as the Bible,” he
wrote to Father Castelli (December 21, 1613), “calls for an interpre -
tation di ffering from the immediate sense of the words” (as when it
speaks of God’s anger, hatred, remorse, hands, and feet), “it seems to
me that as an authority in mathematical controversy it has very little
standing. … I believe that natural processes which we either perceive by
careful obser- vation or deduce by cogent demonstration cannot be
refuted by passages from the Bible.”<em>® Cardinal Bellarmine was
alarmed. Through common friends he sent to Galileo a pointed admonition.
“It seems to me,” he wrote to the astronomer’s pupil Foscarini, “that
you and Galileo would be well advised to speak not in absolute terms
〔of the new astronomy as proved〕 but ex suppositione, as I am
convinced that Copernicus himself did.”^</em>®</p>
<p>On December 21, 1614, a Dominican preacher, Tommaso Caccini, began
the attack, taking as his text an excellent pun, Viri Galilei, quid
statis aspicientes in coelum? — “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing
up into the heavens.^” (Acts, i, 1 1) — and proceeding to show that the
Copemican theory was in irresoluble conflict with the Bible. Other minor
warriors sent complaints to the Inquisition; and on March 20, 1615,
Cassini lodged a formal accusation against Galileo before the
Congregation of the Holy Office (the Inquisition). Monsignor Dini wrote
to Galileo that if he would insert into his publications a few sentences
declaring the Copemican view to be hypothesis, he would not be
disturbed,’*^ but Galileo refused, as he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 607</p>
<p>put it, to “moderate” Copernicus. In a letter to the Grand Duchess of
Tuscany, published in 1615, he wrote with bold clarity: “As to the
arrange - ment of the parts of the universe, I hold the sun to be
situated motionless in the center of the revolution of the celestial
orbs,* while the earth ro- tates on its axis and revolves about the
sun.”<sup>®</sup> He went on to a broader heresy:</p>
<p>Nature … is inexorable and immutable; she never transgresses the</p>
<p>laws imposed upon her, or cares a whit whether her abstruse reasons
and methods of operation are understandable to men. For that reason it
appears that nothing physical w hich sense-experience sets before our
eyes, or which necessary demonstrations prove to us, ought to be</p>
<p>called in question (much less condemned) upon the testimony of</p>
<p>Biblical passages w’hich may have some different meaning beneath</p>
<p>their words.</p>
<p>However, he promised submission to the Church:</p>
<p>I declare (and my sincerity will make itself manifest) not only
that</p>
<p>I mean to submit myself freely and renounce any errors into which</p>
<p>I may fall in this discourse through ignorance of matters
pertaining</p>
<p>to religion, but that I do not desire in these matters to engage in
dis- putes with anyone. . . . My goal is this alone: that if, among
errors</p>
<p>that may abound in these considerations of a subject remote from my
profession, there is anything that may be serviceable to the holy</p>
<p>Church in making a decision concerning the Copernican system, it</p>
<p>may be taken and utilized as seems best to the superiors. And if not,
let my book be torn and burned, as I neither intend nor pretend to gain
from it any fruit that is not pious and Catholic.</p>
<p>But he added, “I do not feel obliged to believe that that same God
who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to
forgo their use.”<sup>®</sup></p>
<p>On December 3, 1615, he went to Rome of his own accord, armed with
friendly letters from the Grand Duke to influential prelates and the
Floren- tine ambassador at the Vatican. In Rome he undertook to convert
ecclesi- astical officials individually; he upheld the Copernican system
at every opportunity; soon “everybody” in Rome was discussing the
stars.^®® On February 26, 1616, the Inquisition directed Cardinal
Bellarmine to “sum - mon before him the said Galileo and admonish him to
abandon the said opinions, and in case of refusal … to intimate to him,
before a notary and</p>
<ul>
<li>By the humor of history this is a proposition that no astronomer
holds today. Perhaps all astronomy, like all history, should be taken as
hypothesis. Of the beyond, as of j’ester- day, there is no
certainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>witnesses, a command to abstain altogether from teaching or defending
the said opinions and even from discussing them. If he do not acquiesce
therein he is to be imprisoned.”^®® Galileo appeared before Cardinal
Bellarmine on that day and declared his submission to the
decree.<sup>®</sup> On March 5 the Holy Office published its historic
edict:</p>
<p>The view that the sun stands motionless at the center of the universe
is foolish, philosophically false, and utterly heretical, because
contrary to Holy Scripture. The view that the earth is not the center of
the</p>
<p>universe and even has a daily rotation is philosophically false, and
at least an erroneous belief.<em>®</em></p>
<p>The Congregation of the Index, on the same date, forbade the publica-
tion or reading of any book advocating the condemned doctrines; but in
the case of Copernicus’ De revolutio nibus orbium coelestium (1543) it
forbade the use of the book “until it is corrected”; and in 1620 it
allowed Catholics to read editions from which nine sentences that
represented the theory as a fact had been removed.</p>
<p>Galileo returned to Florence, lived in studious retirement in his
villa, Bellosguardo, and kept out of controversy till 1622. In 1619 his
disciple Mario Guiducci published an essay embodying Galileo’s theory
(now re - jected) that comets are emanations of the earth’s atmosphere,
and vigorously criticizing the views of the Jesuit Orazio Grassi. The
irate father, under a pseudonym, published an attack upon Galileo and
his followers. In 1622 Galileo sent to Monsignor Cesarini in Rome the
manuscript of II saggiatore (The Assay er), answering Grassi, and
rejecting, in science, all authority but observation, reason, and
experiment. With the author’s consent some members of the Accademia dei
Lincei softened a few passages. In this form Urban VIII accepted its
dedication and sanctioned its publication (October 1623). It is
Galileo’s most brilliant composition, a masterpiece of Italian prose and
controversial skill. The Pope, we are told, enjoyed it; the Jesuits
squirmed.</p>
<p>So encouraged, Galileo set out again for Rome (April i, 1624), hoping
to convert the new Pope to Copemican ideas. Urban received him
cordially, gave him six long interviews and many gifts, listened to the
Copemican arguments, but refused to lift the Inquisition’s ban. Galileo
went back to Florence consoled by Urban’s declaration to the Grand Duke,
“For a long time we have extended our fatherly love to this great man,
whose fame shines in heaven and marches on earth.”<em>®</em> In 1626
Galileo was hearten ed by the appointment of his pupil Benedetto
Castelli to be mathematician to the Pope, and of another pupil. Father
Niccolo Riccardi, as chief censor of the press. He hastened now to
complete his chief work, an exposition of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 609</p>
<p>the Copernican and anti-Copernican systems. In May he took the manu-
script to Rome, showed it to the Pope, and obtained the ecclesiastical
imprimatur for its publication, on condition that the subject be treated
as hypothesis. Back in Florence, Galileo revised the book and issued it
(Feb- ruary 1632) under a long title; Dido go . . . dei due massimi
sistemi del mundo — Didopie of G. G., . . . Where, in Meetings of Four
Days, Are Discussed the Two Chief Systems of the World, Ptolemaic and
Copernican, Indeterminately Proposing the Philosophical and Natural
Arguments, as Well on One Side as on the Other.</p>
<p>The book might have brought Galileo less grief and renown had it not
been for its beginning and its end. Said the preface “to the discerning
reader”:</p>
<p>Several years ago there was published in Rome a salutary edict</p>
<p>which, in order to obviate the dangerous tendencies of our
present</p>
<p>age, imposed a reasonable silence upon the Pythagorean opinion that
the earth moves. There were those who impudently asserted that this
decree had its origin not in judicious inquiry, but in passion none too
well informed. Complaints were to be heard that advisers who were
totally unskilled in astronomical observations ought not to clip the</p>
<p>wings of reflective intellects by means of rash prohibitions.^^®</p>
<p>This was in effect to notify the reader that the dialogue form was a
dodge to elude the Inquisition. In the dialogue two characters, Salviati
and Sagredo — the names of two of Galileo’s warmest friends — defend the
Copernican system; a third character, Simplicio, rejects it, but with
transparent sophis- try. Near the end of the work Galileo put into
Simplicio’s mouth, almost verbatim, a statement that Urban VIII had
insisted on being added: “God is all-powerful; all things are therefore
possible to him; ergo the tides cannot be adduced as a necessary proof
of the double motion of the earth without limiting God’s omniscience.”
Upon which Salviati comments sarcastically, “An admirable and truly
angelic argument.”^^^</p>
<p>The Jesuits, several of whom were roughly handled in the Dialogue</p>
<p>(Schemer’s ideas were called “vain and foolish”), pointed out to the
Pope that his statement had been put into the mouth of a character who
through- out the book had been represented as a simpleton. Urban
appointed a com- mission to examine the work; it reported that Galileo
had treated the Copernican system not as hypothesis but as fact, and
that he had secured the imprimatur by clever misrepresentations. The
Jesuits added, with fore- sight, that the doctrines of Copernicus and
Galileo were more dangerous to the Church than all the heresies of
Luther and Calvin. In August 1632 the Inquisition forbade further sale
of the Dialogue, and ordered the con- fiscation of all remaining copies.
On September 23 it summoned Galileo to</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>6lO</p>
<p>appear before its commissioner in Rome. His friends pleaded his
sixty-eight years and many infirmities, but to no avail. His daughter,
now a fervent nun, sent him touching letters begging him to submit to
the Church. The Grand Duke advised him to obey, provided him with the
grand-ducal sedan chair, and arranged with the Florentine ambassador to
house him in the embassy. Galileo reached Rome February 13, 1633.</p>
<p>Two months passed before the Inquisition called him to its palace
(April</p>
<p>12). He was charged with having broken his promise to obey the decree
of February 26, i6i6, and was urged to confess his guilt. He refused,
pro- testing that he had only presented the Copernican view as
hypothesis. He was kept a prisoner in the palace of the Inquisition till
April 30. There he fell sick. He was not put to torture, but may have
been led to fear it. At a second appearance before the commission he
humbly confessed that he had stated the case for Copernicus more
strongly than against him, and offered to correct this in a
supplementary dialogue. He was allowed to re- turn to the house of the
ambassador. On May 10 he was examined again; he offered to do penance
and hegged consideration for his age and ill health. At a fourth
examination (June 2 1 ) he affirmed that after the decree of 1616 “every
doubt vanished from my mind, and I held and still hold Ptolemy’s opinion
— ^that the earth is motionless and that the sun moves — as absolutely
true and incontestable.”^*® The Inquisition countered that Galile o’s
dialogues made quite clear his acceptance of Copernicus; Galileo
insisted that he had been anti-Copemican since 16 1 6. The Pope had kept
in touch with the examination, but had not attended in person. Galileo
hoped that Urban VIII would come to his aid, but the Pope refused to
interfere. On June 22 the Inquisition pronounced him guilty of heresy
and disobedience; it offered him absolution on condition of full
abjuration; it sentenced him to “the prison of this Holy Office for a
period determinable</p>
<p>With a sincere heart and unfeigned faith I abjure, curse, and
detest</p>
<p>the said errors and heresies, and generally every other error and
heresy contrary to the . . . Holy Church, and I swear that I will
nevermore</p>
<p>in future say or assert anything . . . which may give rise to a
similar</p>
<p>suspicion of me; and that if I shall know any heretic or anyone
sus-</p>
<p>pected of heresy, I will denounce him to this Holy Office. … So</p>
<p>may God help me, and these His Holy Gospels which I touch with</p>
<p>my own hands.**®</p>
<p>The sentence was signed by seven cardinals, but did not receive papal
ratification.**^ The story that on leaving the trial chamber Galileo
mut-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF GALILEO 6ll</p>
<p>tered defiantly, “Eppur si mnover (And yet it does mov e!), is a
legend not traceable before 1761.^^® After three days in the prison of
the Inqui- sition he was allowed, by order of the Pope, to go to the
villa of the Grand Duke at Trinita dei Monti in Rome; a week later he
was transferred to comfortable quarters in the palace of his former
pupil. Archbishop Ascanio Piccolomini, at Siena. In December 1633 he was
allowed to remove to his own villa at Arcetri, near Florence.
Technically he was still a prisoner, and he was forbidden to wander
outside his own grounds, but he was free to pursue his studies, teach
pupils, write books, and receive visitors — here Milton came in 1638.
His nun daughter came to live with him, and took upon herself the
penalty of reciting the psalms.</p>
<p>4 . The Patriarch</p>
<p>Apparently he was a broken man, defeated and humiliated by a Church
that felt herself the guardian of the faith, hopes, and morals of
mankind. His abjuration, after months of imprisonment and days of
questioning that could have shattered the mind and will of a young
warrior, was forgivable in an old man who remembered Bruno’s burning
thirty -three years before. But he was not really defeated. His book
spread through Europe in a dozen translations, and his book did not
recant.</p>
<p>He solaced his grief at Siena and Arcetri by summing up his physical
re- searches in another major work, Discorsi e dimostrasdoni matematiche
in- tomo a due nuove scienze (Dialogues . . . Concerning Tioo Neiv
Sciences). As the Italian press was closed to him by his condemnation,
he negotiated secretly with foreign printers, and finally the Elzevir
firm issued the book at Leiden in 1638. It was acclaimed throughout th6
learned world as raising the science of mechanics to a higher level than
ever before. After its publication he continued to prepare additional
dialogues, in which he studied the mechanics of percussion and
adumbrated Newton’s second law of mo - tion. “In the last days of his
life,” says his first biographer, “and amid much physical suffering, his
mind was constantly occupied with mechanical and mathematical
problems.”^^® In 1637, just before his eyesight began to fail, he
announced his last astronomical discovery, the librations of the moon —
the variations in that side of the moon which always faces the earth.
And in 1641, a few months before his death, he explained to his son a
plan for making a pendulum clock.</p>
<p>The portrait that Sustermans painted of him at Arcetri (now in
the</p>
<p>Pitti Gallery) is of genius incarnate; immense forehead, pugnacious
lips, searching nose, penetrating eyes; this is one of the noblest faces
in history. The eyes lost their sight in 1638, perhaps from too arduous
gazing. He con-</p>
<p>6i2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXH</p>
<p>soled himself with the thought that no man since Adam had seen so
much as he. “This universe,” he said, “that I have extended a thousand
times . . . has now shrunk to the narrow confines of my own body. Thus
God likes it; so I too must like it.”^^^ In 1639, suffering from
sleeplessness and a hundred pains, he was allowed by the Inquisition to
visit Florence, under strict surveillance, to see a physician and hear
Mass. Back in Arcetri he dictated to Viviani and Torricelli and played
the lute, till his hearing also failed. On January 8, 1642, aged almost
seventy-eight, he died in the arms of his disciples.</p>
<p>Grotius called him “the greatest mind of all time.”“® He had, of
course, some limitations of intellect and character. His faults — pride,
temper, vanity — were literally the defects or price of his qualities:
his persistence, courage, and originality. He did not recognize the
importance of Kepler’s calculations on the planetary orbits. He was slow
to credit the work of his contemporaries. He hardly realized how many of
his discoveries in mechanics had been made before him — some by another
Florentine, Leon- ardo. The views for which he was punished are not
precisely those that astronomers hold today; like most martyrs, he
suffered for the right to be wrong. But he was not wrong in feeling that
he had made dynamics a full- fledged science and had widened the human
mind and perspective by re- vealing, in greater measure than ever
before, the frightful immensity of the universe. He shared with Kepler
the honor of winning acceptance for Copernicus, and with Newton the
distinction of showing that the heavens declare the glory of law. And,
like a good son of the Renaissance, he wrote the best Italian prose of
his time.</p>
<p>His influence pervaded Europe. His very condemnation raised the
status of science in northern lands, while lowering it for a while in
Italy and Spain. Not that the Inquisition destroyed Italian science:
Torricelli, Cassini, Borelli, Redi, Malpighi, Morgagni carried the torch
on to Volta, Galvani, and Marconi. But Italian scientists, remembering
Galileo, avoided the philo- sophical implications of science. After the
burning of Bruno and the</p>
<p>intimidation of Descartes by Galileo’s fate, European philosophy
became a Protestant monopoly.</p>
<p>In 1835 the Church withdrew the works of Galileo from her Index of
Prohibited Books. The broken and defeated man had triumphed over the
most powerful institution in history.</p>
