<h4 id="chapter-xvi">CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<p>The Borgias</p>
<p>1492-1503</p>
<p>I. CARDINAL BORGIA</p>
<p>T HE most interesting of the Renaissance popes was born at
Xativa,</p>
<p>Spain, on January 1, 1431. His parents were cousins, both of the</p>
<p>Bor j as, a family of some slight nobility. Rodrigo received his
education at Xativa, Valencia, and Bologna. When his uncle became a
cardinal, and then Pope Calixtus III, a straight path was opened for the
young man’s ad - vancement in an ecclesiastical career. Moving to Italy,
he respelled his name Borgia, was made a cardinal at twenty-five, and at
twenty-six received the fruitful office of vice-chancellor — head of the
entire Curia. He per- formed his duties competently, earned some repute
as an administrator, lived abstemiously, and made many friends in either
sex. He was not yet — would not be till his thirty-seventh year — a
priest.</p>
<p>He was so handsome in his youth, so attractive in the grace of his
man- ners, his sensual ardor and cheerful temperament, his persuasive
eloquence and gay wit, that women found it hard to resist him. Brought
up in the easygoing morality of fifteenth-century Italy, and perceiving
that many a cleric, many a priest, allowed himself the pleasure of
women, this young Lothario in the purple decided to enjoy all the gifts
that God had given him and them. Pius II reproved him for attending “an
immodest and seductive dance” (1460), but the Pope accepted Rodrigo’s
apology, and continued him as vice-chancellor and trusted aide. 1 In
that year Rodrigo’s first son, Pedro Luis, was born or begotten, and
perhaps also his daughter Girolama, who was married in 1482; 2 their
mothers are not known. Pedro lived in Spain till 1488, came to Rome in
that year, and died soon afterward. In 1464 Rodrigo accompanied Pius II
to Ancona, and there contracted some minor sexual disease “because,”
said his doctor, “he had not slept alone.” 3</p>
<p>About 1466 he formed a more permanent attachment with Vanozza de’
Catanei, then some twenty-four years old. Unfortunately, she was married
to Domenico d’Arignano, but Domenico left her in 147 6. 4 To Rodrigo
(who had become a priest in 1468) Vanozza bore four children: in
1474</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>405</p>
<p>Giovanni, in 1476 Cesare (whom we shall call Caesar), in 1480
Lucrezia, in 1481 Giofre. These four were ascribed to Vanozza on her
tombstone, and were at one time or another acknowledged by Rodrigo as
his own. 5 Such persistent parentage suggests an almost monogamous
union, and perhaps Cardinal Borgia, in comparison with other
ecclesiastics, may be credited with a certain domestic fidelity and
stability.* He was a tender and benev- olent father; it was a pity that
his efforts to advance his children did not always bring glory to the
Church. When Rodrigo set his eye on the</p>
<p>papacy he found a tolerant husband for Vanozza, and helped her to
pros- perity. She was twice widowed, married again, lived in modest
retirement, rejoiced in the rise of her children to fame and wealth,
mourned her separa- tion from them, earned a reputation for piety, died
at seventy-six (1518), and left all her substantial property to the
Church. Leo X sent his chamber- lain to attend her ceremonious funeral.
7</p>
<p>We should betray a lack of historical sense were we to judge Alexan-
der VI from the moral standpoint of our age — or rather of our youth.
His contemporaries looked upon his prepapal sexual sins as only
canonically mortal, but, in the moral climate of his time, venial and
forgivable. 8 Even in the generation betw een the reproof given him by
Pius II and Rodrigo’s elevation to the papacy, public opinion had become
more lenient toward unobtrusive sexual digressions from clerical
celibacy. Pius II himself, be- sides spawning some love children in his
presacerdotal youth, had once ad- vocated the marriage of priests;
Sixtus IV had had several children; Inno- cent VIII had brought his into
the Vatican. Some condemned the morals of Rodrigo, but apparently no one
mentioned them when the conclave met to choose a successor to Innocent.
Five popes, including the reasonably vir- tuous Nicholas V, had granted
him lucrative benefices through all these years, had entrusted him with
difficult missions and responsible posts, and had apparently (Pius II
for a moment excepted) taken no notice of his philoprogenitive
exuberance. 9 What men remarked in 1492 was that he had been
vice-chancellor for thirty-five years, had been appointed and reap-
pointed to that office by five successive popes, and had administered
the office with conspicuous industry and competence; and that the
external magnificence of his palace concealed a remarkable simplicity of
private life. Iacopo da Volterra, in i486, described him as “a man of an
intellect capable of anything, and of great sense; he is a ready
speaker, is of an astute</p>
<ul>
<li>Says the judicious Roscoe: “His attachment to Vanozza appears to
have been sincere and uniform; and although his connexion was
necessarily disavowed, he regarded her as a legitimate wife .” 6</li>
</ul>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>nature, and has wonderful skill in conducting affairs.” 10 He was
popular with the Romans, having amused them with games; when news
reached Rome that Granada had fallen to the Christians, he regaled Rome
with a bullfight in Spanish style.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cardinals assembling in conclave on August 6, 1492, were
also interested in his wealth, for in five administrations he had become
the richest cardinal — excepting d’Estouteville— in the memory of Rome.
They relied upon him to make substantial presents to those who should
vote for him; and he did not fail them. To Cardinal Sforza he promised
the vice- chancellorship, several rich benefices, and the Borgia palace
in Rome; to Cardinal Orsini the see and ecclesiastical revenues of
Cartagena, the towns of Monticelli and Soriano, and the governorship of
the Marches; to Cardinal Savelli Civita Castellana and the bishopric of
Majorca; and so on; Infessura described the process as Borgia’s
“evangelical distribution of his goods to t he poor.” 11 It was not an
unusual procedure; every candidate had used it for many conclaves past,
as every candidate uses it in politics today. Whether money bribes were
also used is uncertain. 12 The decisive vote was cast by Cardinal
Gherardo, ninety- six years old, and “hardly in possession of his
faculties.” 13 Finally all the cardinals rushed to the winning side, and
made the election of Rodrigo Borgia unanimous (August 10, 1492). When
asked by what name he wished to be called as pope, he answere d, “By the
name of the invincible Alexander.” It was a pagan beginning for a pagan
pontificate.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ALEXANDER VI</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of the conclave was also the choice of the people. Never
had any papal election brought so much rejoicing, 14 never had a
coronation been so magnificent. The populace delighted in the panoramic
cavalcade of white horses, allegorical figures, tapestries and
paintings, knights and gran- dees, troops of archers and Turkish
horsemen, seven hundred priests, car- dinals colorfully clad, and
finally Alexander himself, sixty-one years old but majestically straight
and tall, overflowing with health and energy and pride, “serene of
countenance and of surpassing dignity,” said an eyewitness, 15 and
looking like an emperor even while blessing the multitude. Only a few
sober minds, like Giuliano della Rovere and Giovanni de’ Medici,
expressed</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>407</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>He began well. In the thirty-six days between the death of Innocent
and the coronation of Alexander there had been two hundred and twenty
known murders in Rome. The new Pope made an example of the first
captured assassin; the culprit was hanged, his brother was hanged with
him, and his house was pulled down. The city approved this severity;
crime hid its head; order was restored in Rome, and all Italy was glad
that a strong hand was at the helm of the Church 18</p>
<p>Art and literature marked time. Alexander did considerable building
in and out of Rome; financed a new ceiling for Santa Maria Maggiore with
a gift of American gold from Ferdinand and Isabella; remodeled the
Mauso- leum of Hadrian int o the fortified Castle of Sant’ Angelo, and
redecorated</p>
<p>He rebuilt the University of Rome, called to it several
distinguished</p>
<p>teachers, and paid them with unheard-of regularity. He liked drama,
and was pleased to have the students of the Roman Academy stage comedies
and ballets for his family festivals. He preferred light music to heavy
phi- losophy. In 1501 he re-established censorship of publications by an
edict requiring that no book might be printed without the approval of
the local archbishop. But he allowed a wide freedom of satire and
debate. He laughed off the bites of the town wits, and rejected Caesar
Borgia’s proposal that such snipers should be disciplined. “Rome is a
free city,” he told the Ferrarese ambassador, “where everyone can say or
write whatever he pleases. They say much evil of me, but I don’t mind.”
18</p>
<p>His administration of Church affairs was, in the early years of his
pontif- icate, unusually efficient. I nnocent VIII had left a debt in
the treasury; “it needed all the financial ability of Alexander to
restore the papal finances; it took him two years to balance the
budget.” 18 “ The Vatican staff was re - duced, and expenses were
curtailed, but records were strictly kept, and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>408</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>salaries were promptly paid. 18 Alexander performed the laborious
religious ritual of his office with fidelity, but with the impatience of
a busy man. 20 His magister ceremoniaruvi was a German, Johann Burchard,
who helped to perpetuate the fame and infamy of his employer by
recording in a Di- arium nearly all that he saw, including much that
Alexander would have wished unseen. To the cardinals the Pope gave as he
had promised in the c onclave, and he was even more generous to those
who, like Cardinal de’ Medici, had longest opposed him. A year after his
accession he created twelve new cardinals. Several were men of real
ability; some were ap- pointed at the request of political powers that
it was wise to conciliate; two were scandalously young — Ippolito
d’Este, fifteen, and Caesar Borgia, eight - een; one of them, Alessandro
Farnese, owed his elevation to his sister Giulia Farnese, who was
believed by many to be a mistress of the Pope. The sharp-tongued Romans,
not foreseeing that they would one day acclaim Alessandro as Paul III,
called him il cardinale della gonnella — the cardinal of the petticoat.
The strongest of the older cardinals, Giuliano della Rovere, was
displeased to find that he, who had often ruled Innocent VIII, had
little influence with Alexander, who made Cardinal Sforza his favorite
counselor. In a huff Giuliano retired to his episcopal see at Ostia, and
formed a guard of armed men. A year later he fled to France, and
besought Charles VIII to invade Italy, summon a general council, and
depose Alexander as a shamelessly simoniacal pope.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alexander was facing the political problems of a papacy</p>
<p>caught between the millstones of scheming Italian powers. The Papal
States had again fallen into the hands of local dictators who, while
calling themselves vicars of the Church, had snatched the opportunity
provided by the weakness of Innocent VIII to re-establish the practical
independence that they or their predecessors had lost under Albornoz or
Sixtus IV. Some papal cities had been seized by neighboring powers; so
Naples had taken Sora and Aquila in 1467, and Milan had appropriated
Forli in 1488. Alex- ander’s first task, then, was to bring these stat
es under a centralized papal rule and taxation, as the kings of Spain,
France, and England had subdued the feudal lords. This was the mission
that he assigned to Caesar Borgia, who accomplished it with such speed
and ruthlessness as made Machiavelli gape with admiration.</p>
<p>Closer to Rome, and more immediately harassing, was the turbulent
autonomy of the nobles, theoretically subject, actually hostile and
danger- ous, to the popes. The temporal weakness of the papacy since
Boniface VIII (d. 1303) had allowed these barons to maintain a medieval
feudal sover-</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>409</p>
<p>eignty on their estates, making their own laws, organizing their own
armies, fighting at will their private and reckless wars, to the ruin of
order and com- merce in Latium. Soon after Alexander’s accession
Franceschetto Cibo sold to Virginio Orsini, for 40,000 ducats (00,000),
estates left him by his father Innocent VIII. But this Orsini was a high
officer in the Neapolitan army; he had received from Ferrante most of
the money for the purchase; 21 in effect Naples had secured two
strategic strongholds in papal territory. 22 Alexander reacted by
forming an alliance with Venice, Milan, Ferrara, and Siena, raising an
army, and fortifying the wall between Sant’ Angelo and the Vatican.
Ferdinand II of Spain, fearing that a combined attack upon Naples would
end the Aragon power in Italy, persuaded Alexander and Ferrante to
negotiate. Orsini paid the Pope 40,000 ducats for the right to retain
his purchases; and Alexander betrothed his son Giofre, then thirteen, to
Sancia, the pretty granddaughter of the Neapolitan King (1494).</p>
<p>In return for Ferdinand’s happy mediation, Alexander awarded him the
two Americas. Columbus had discovered the “Indies” some tw o months
after Alexander’s succession, and had presented them to Ferdinand and
Isabella. Portugal claimed the New World by virtue of an edict of Calix-
tus III (1479), which had confirmed her claim to all lands on the
Atlantic coast. Spain retorted that the edict had in mind only the
eastern Atlantic. The states were near war when Alexander issued two
bulls (May 3 and 4,</p>
<ol start="1493" type="1">
<li>allotting to Spain all discoveries west, and to Portugal all those
east, of an imaginary line drawn from pole to pole a hundred Spanish
leagues west of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, in each case on
condition that the lands discovered were not already inhabited by
Christians, and that the conquerors would make every effort to convert
their new subjects to the Christian f aith. The “grant” of the Pope, of
course, merely confirmed a conquest of the sword, but it preserved the
peace of the peninsular powers. No one seems to have thought that
non-Christians had any rights to the lands in which they dwelt.</li>
</ol>
<p>If Alexander might distribute continents he found it difficult to
hold the Vatican. When Ferrante of Naples died (1494), Charles VIII
decided to invade Italy and restore Naples to French rule. Fearing
deposition, Alex- ander went to the extraordinary step of soliciting
help from the Sultan of the Turks. In July, 1494, he sent a papal
secretary, Giorgio Bocciardo to warn Bajazet II that Charles VIII was
planning to enter Italy, take Naples depose or control the Pope, and use
Djem as a pretender to the Ottoman throne in a crusade against
Constantinople. Alexander proposed that Baja- zet should make common
cause with the papacy, Naples, and perhaps Ven-</p>
<p>410 THE RENAISSANCE ( CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>ice, against the French. Bajazet received Bocciardo with Oriental
courtesy, and sent him back with the 40,000 ducats due for the
maintenance of Djem, and with an envoy of his own to Alexander. At
Senigallia Bocciardo was captured by Giovanni della Rovere, brother to
the disaffected cardinal; the 40,000 ducats were seized, together with
five letters allegedly from the Sultan to the Pope. One letter proposed
that Alexander should put Djem to death and send the dead body to
Constantinople; upon its receipt the Sultan would pay the Pope 300,000
ducats (S3, 750, 000), “with which Yo ur Highness may buy some dominions
for your children.” 23 Cardinal della Rovere gave copies of the letters
to the French King. Alexander claimed that the Cardinal had forged the
letters and had invented the whole story. The evidence supports the
authen ticity of Alexander’s message to Bajazet, but discounts the
Sultan’s reply as probably forged. 24 Venice and Naples had already
entered into similar negotiations with the Turks; Francis I would later
do likewise. To rulers religion, like almost everything else, is a tool
of power.</p>
<p>Charles came, advanced through friendly Milan and frightened
Florence, and approached Rome (December, 1494). The Colonna supported
him by preparing to invade the capital. A French fleet seized Ostia —
Rome’s port at the mouth of the Tiber — and threatened to stop the
supply of grain from Sicily. Many cardinals, including Ascanio Sforza,
declared for</p>
<p>Charles; Virginio Orsini opened his castles to the King; half the
cardinals in Rome besought him to depose the Pope. 24 “ Alexander
withdrew to Castel Sant’ Angelo, and sent envoys to treat with the
conqueror. Charles did not wish, by attempting to remove the Pope, to
rouse Spain against him; his goal was Naples, whose wealth was ever in
the thoughts of his officers. He made peace with Alexander on condition
of an unimpeded passage for his army through Latium, papal forgiveness
of the pro-French cardinals, and the surrender of Djem. Alexander
yielded, returned to the Vatican, enjoyed Charles’s three genuflections
before h im, graciously prevented him from kissing the papal feet, and
received from the King the formal “obedience”</p>
<p>Once the French were gone, Alexander recovered his courage. Now,
probably, he made up his mind that strong Papal States, a good army, and
a good general were necessary to the safety of the popes from secular
domi- nation. 28 With Venice, Germany, Spain, and Milan he formed a
Holy</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>4 II</p>
<p>League (A 4 arch 31, 1495), ostensibly for mutual defense and for war
against the Turks, secretly for the expulsion of the French from Italy.
Charles took the hint, and retreated through Rome to Pisa; Alexander, to
avoid him, sojourned in Orvieto and Perugia. When Charles fled back to
France Alexander returned in triumph to Rome. He demanded of Florence
that it should join the League, and expel or silence Savonarola, friend
of France and foe of the Pope. He reorganized the papal army, put his
oldest surviving son Giovanni at its head, and bade him conquer for the
papacy the revolted Orsini fortresses ( 1496). But Giovanni was no
general; he was defeated at Soriano, returned to Rome in disgrace, and
pursued the careless gallantries that probably caused his early death.
Nevertheless Alexander recovered the strongholds sold to Virginio
Orsini, and recaptured Ostia from the French. Apparently victorious over
all obstacles, he bade Pin- turicchio paint on the walls of the papal
apartment in Sant’ Angelo frescoes picturing the triumph of the Pope
over the King. Alexander was at the top of his curve.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE SINNER</li>
</ol>
<p>Rome applauded him for his internal administration, and his
successful though hesitant diplomacy. It reproved him mildly for his
love affairs, vig- orously for feathering the nests of his children,
bitterly for appointing to office in Rome a host of Spaniards whose
alien mien and speech set Italian teeth on edge. A hundred Spanish
relatives of the Pope had flocked to Rome; “ten papacies,” said one
observer, “would not h ave sufficed for all these cousins.” 27 Alexander
himself was by this time fully Italian in his cul - ture, policy, and
ways, but he still loved Spain, spoke Spanish too fre- quently with
Caesar and Lucrezia, elevated nineteen Spaniards to the car- dinalate,
and surrounded himself with Catalan servants and aides. Finally the
jealous Romans, half in humor, half in wrath, called him “the marrano
Pope,” 28 implying his descent from Christianized Spanish Jews.
Alexander excused himself on the ground that many Italians, especially
in the college of cardinals, had proved faithless to him, and that he
had to have about him a nucleus of supporters bound to him by a personal
loyalty based on their awareness that he was their sole protector in
Rome.</p>
<p>He — and the princes of Europe down to Napoleon — argued likewise in
promoting relatives to positions of trust and power.* He hoped for a
while</p>
<ul>

politics allies were not to be trusted unless their fidelity was secured

<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>that his son Giovanni might help him to protect the Papal States, but
Gio- vanni had inherited his father’s sensitivity to women without
Alexander’s capacity to govern men. Perceiving that of his sons only
Caesar had in him the iron and gall necessary to play the game of
Italian politics in that violent age, Alexander conferred upon him a
maze of benefices whose income would finance the yout h’s rising power.
Even the gentle Lucrezia was an instrument of policy, and found herself
promoted to the governorship of a city or the bed of a valuable duke.
The Pope’s fondness for Lucrezia led him to such shows of affection that
cruel gossip accused him of incest, and pictured him as competing with
his sons for her love. 29 On two occasions when he had to be absent from
Rome, Alexander left Lucrezia in charge of his rooms in the Vatican,
with authority to open his correspondence and attend to all routine
business. Such delegation of power to a woman was frequent in the ruling
houses of Italy — as in Ferrara, Urbino, Mantua — but it mildly shocked
even blase Rome. When Giofre and Sancia arrived from Naples after their
wedding, Caesar and Lucrezia went out to meet them; all four then
hurried to the Vatican, and Alexander was happy to have them near him.
“Other popes, to conceal their infamy,” says Guicciardini, “were wont to
term their offspring nephews; but Alexander took delight in let- ting a
ll the world know that they were his children.” 30</p>
<p>The city had forgiven the Pope his pristine Vanozza, but marveled at
his current Giulia. Giulia Farnese was noted for her beauty, above all
for her golden hair; when she let it down, and it hung to her feet, it
was a sight that would have stirred the blood of men less mettlesome
than Alexander. Her friends called her La Bella. Sanudo speaks of her as
“the Pope’s favorite, a young woman of great beauty and understanding,
gracious and gentle.” 31 In 1 493 Infessura described her as attending
Lucrezia’s nuptial banquet in the Vatican, and called her Alexander’s
“concubine”; Matarazzo, the Pe - rugian historian, used the same term
for Giulia, but probably copied In- fessura; and a Florentine wit in
1494 called her sposa di Cristo, bride of Christ, a phrase usually
reserved for the Church. 32 Some scholars have sought to clear Giulia on
the ground that Lucrezia — who has been made respectable by research —
remained her friend to the end, and that Giulia’ s</p>
<p>used the marriage connections of his family as a means to secure for
himself a strong political party. He had no one whom he could trust save
his own children, whom he regarded as instruments for his own plans.”—
M. Creighton, History of the Papacy During the Period of the
Reformation, III, 263. The impartiality and learning of the Anglican
bishop is matched in this field only by the scholarship and honesty of
the Catholic Ludwig von Pastor’s History of the Popes . The existence of
these two remarkable histories should long since have dis- sipated the
mist of legend cast by partisan pamphleteering around the Renaissance
popes.</p>

<p>husband, Orsino Orsini, built a chapel to her honored memory. 33 In
1492 Giulia gave birth to a daughter Laura, who was officially listed as
begotten by Orsini, but Cardinal Alessandro Farnese recognized the girl
as Alex- ander’s child. 34 * By yet another woman the Pope was credited
with having a mysterious son, born about 1498, a nd known in Burchard’s
diary as Irfans Romanus , 35 It is not certain, but one more or less
hardly matters.</p>
<p>There is no question that Alexander was a sensual man, full-blooded
to a degree painfully uncongenial to celibacy. When he gave a public
festival in the Vatican, at which a comedy was performed (February,
1503), he rumbled with amusement, and was pleased to have fair women
crowd about him and seat themselves gracefully on footstools at his
feet. He was a man. He seems to have felt, like many clergymen of the
time, that clerical celi- bacy was a mistake of Hildebrand’s, and that
even a cardinal should be per - mitted the pleasures and tribulations of
female company. He showed feel- ings of husbandly tenderness for
Vanozza, and perhaps a paternal solicitude for Giulia. On the other hand
his devotion to his children, sometimes over- riding his fidelity to the
interests of the Church, could well be used to argue the wisdom of the
canon law requiring celibacy of a priest.</p>
<p>In these middle years of his pontificate, before Caesar Borgia
overshad- owed it, Alexander had many virtues. Though he bore himself
with proud dignity at public functions, in private he was jovial,
good-natured, san- guine, eager to enjoy life, capable of a hearty laugh
at seeing, from his win- dow, a parade of masked men “with long false
noses of great size in the form of the male member.” 30 He was a bit
stout now, if we may trust Pin - turicchio’s apparently honest picture
of him, praying, on the Appartamento</p>
<p>Was his Christianity a pretense? Probably not. His letters, even
those concerning Giulia, are warm with phrases of piety that were not
indis- pensable in private correspondence. 38 He was so much a man of
action, and had so thoroughly absorbed the easy morals of his time, that
he only spo- radically noted any contradiction between Christian ethics
and his life. Like most persons completely orthodox in theology, he was
completely worldly in conduct. He seems to have felt that in his
circumstances the papacy needed a statesman, not a saint; he admired
sanctity, but thought it</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>belonged to monasticism and private life rather than to a man
compelled to deal at every step with subtle and acquisitive despots or
unscrupulous and treacherous diplomats. He ended by adopting all their
methods, and the most questionable devices of his predecessors in the
papacy.</p>
<p>Needing funds for his government and his wars, he sold offices, took
over the estates of dead cardinals, and exploited the jubilee of 1500 to
the full. Dispensations and divorces were given as profitable parts of
political bargains; so King Ladislaus VII of Hungary paid 30,000 ducats
for the an- nulment of his marriage with Beatrice of Naples; had Henry
VIII such an Alexander to deal with he would have remained to the end a
Defender of the Faith. When the jubilee threatened to be a financial
disappointment because would-be pilgrims stayed home through fear of
robbery, pestilence, or war, Alexander, not to be cheated, and following
pontifical precedents, issued a bull (March 4, 1500) detailing by what
payments Christians might obtain the jubilee indulgence without coming
to Rome, at what cost peni- tents might gain absolution from
consanguineous marriages, and how much a clergyman should pay to be
forgiven sim ony and “irregularity.” 39 On December 1 6 he extended the
jubilee till Epiphany. The collectors prom- ised payors that the funds
gathered in by the jubilee would be used in a crusade against the Turks;
the promise was kept in the case of Polish and Venetian collections; but
Caesar Borgia used jubilee proceeds to finance his campaigns for the
recovery of the Papal States. 40</p>
<p>To further celebrate the jubilee, Alexander (September 28, 1500) cre-
ated twelve new cardinals, who paid a total of 120,000 ducats for their
appointment; and these promotions, says Guicciardini, were made “not of
such as had the most merit, but of those that offered the most money.”
41 In 1 503 he named nine additional cardinals at a commensurate price.
42 In the same year he created ex nihilo eighty new offices in the
Curia, and these places, according to the hostile Venetian ambassador
Giustiniani, were sold at 760 ducats each. 43 A satirist attached to the
statue of Pasquino (1503) a stinging pasquinade:</p>
<p>Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum;</p>
<p>vendere iure potest, emerat ipse prius 44 —</p>
<p>“the keys, the altars, Alexander sells, and Christ; with right, since
he has paid for them.”</p>
<p>By canon law the property left by an ecclesiastic at his death
reverted to the Church, except as the pope might allow otherwise. 45
Alexander regu- larly gave such dispensations except in the case of
cardinals. Under pres-</p>

<p>sure from the victorious but money-consuming Caesar Borgia, Alexander
made it a general principle to appropriate the fortunes left by high
ecclesi- astics; in this way substantial sums came into the treasury.
Some cardinals eluded the Pope by making large gifts in expectation of
death, and some, during their lives, deliberately squandered great sums
on their funeral mon- uments. When Cardinal Michiel died (1503), his
house was immediately stripped of its wealth by the agents of the Pope,
who, if we may believe Giustiniani, netted 150,000 ducats; Alexander
complained that only 23,832 were in cash. 46</p>
<p>Deferring fuller consideration of the alleged poisonings, by
Alexander or Caesar Borgia, of high ecclesiastics who took too long to
die, we may pro- visionally accept the conclusion of recent research —
that “there is no evi - dence that Alexander VI poisoned anybody.” 47
This does not quite clear him; he may have been too clever for history.
But he could not escape the satirists, pamphleteers, and other wits who
sold their deadly epigrams to his opponents. We have seen how Sannazaro
belabored Pope and son with lethal couplets in the strife between the
papacy and Naples. Infessura served the Colonna with his
scandalmongering pen; and Geronimo Manci- one was worth a regiment to
the Savelli barons. Alexander, as part of his campaign against the
Campagna nobles, issued in 1501 a bull detailing the crimes and vices of
the Savelli and the Colonna. Its exaggerations were bet- tered in
Mancione’s famous “Letter to Silvio Savelli,” retailing the vices and
crimes of Alexander and Caesar Borgia. This document was widely circu-
lated, and did much to create the legend of Alexander as a monster of
per- versions and cruelty. 48 Alexander won the battle of the sword, but
his noble foes, unchecked by his enemy Pope Julius II, won the battle of
the word, and transmitted their picture of him to history.</p>
<p>He paid too little attention to public opinion, and rarely answered
the slanders that so mercilessly multiplied the reality of his faults.
He was re- solved to build a strong state, and thought that it could not
be done by Christian means. His use of the traditional tools of
statecraft — propaganda, deception, intrigue, discipline, war — was
bound to offend those who pre- ferred a Christian Church to a strong
one, and those to whose advantage it was that the papacy and the Papal
States should be disorganized and weak among the nobles of Rome and the
powers of Italy. Occasionally Alex- ander stopped to examine his life by
evangelical standards, and then he ad- mitted himself to be a simoniac,
a fornicator, even — through war — a de- stroyer of human lives. Once,
when his lucky star seemed suddenly to fall, and all his proud and happy
world seemed shattered, he lost his Machia-</p>
<p>416 the renaissance (chap, xvi</p>
<p>vellian amoralism, confessed his sins, and vowed to reform himself
and the Church.</p>
<p>He loved his son Giovanni even more than his daughter Lucrezia. When
Pedro Luis died, Alexander saw to it that Giovanni should receive the
duchy of Gandia in Spain. It was easy to love the lad, he was so
handsome, kindly, gay. The fond father did not perceive that the youth
was made for Eros, not for Mars; he made him a general, and the young
commander proved incompetent. Giovanni thought a beautiful woman more
precious than a captured city. On June 14, 1497, he supped with his
brother Caesar and other guests at the home of his mother Vanozza. As
they were return- ing, Giovanni parted from Caesar and the rest, saying
that he wished to visit a lady of his acquaintance. He was never seen
alive again. When his dis- appearance was noted the anxious Pope sent
out an alarm. A boatman con- fessed that he had seen a body thrown into
the Tiber on the night of the 14th; asked why he had not reported it he
replied that in the course of his life he had seen a hundred such
disposals, and had learned not to trouble himself about them. The river
was dragged, the body was found, stabbed in nine places; apparently the
young Duke had been attacked by several men. Alexander was so broken
with grief that he shut himself up in a pri- vate chamber and refused
food, and his moans could be heard in the street.</p>
<p>He ordered a search for the murderers, but perhaps he soon reconciled
himself to letting the case remain a mystery. The body had been
recovered near the castle of Antonio Pico della Mirandola, whose pretty
daughter had allegedly been seduced by the Duke; many contemporaries,
like the Mantuan ambassador Scalona, ascribed the death to thugs hired
by the Count; and this is still the likeliest explanation. 49 Others,
including the Flor- entine and Milanese ambassadors at Rome, attributed
the crime to some member of the Orsini clan, then at war with the Pope.
50 Some scandal- sippers said that Giovanni had made love to his sister
Lucrezia, and had been killed by retainers of her husband Giovanni
Sforza. 61 No one at the time accused Caesar Borgia. Caesar, now
twenty-two, had apparently been on the best terms with his brother; he
was a cardinal, and was moving in his own line of advancement; not till
fourteen months later did he turn to a military career; he derived no
advantage from his brother’s death; he could hardly have anticipated
that Giovanni would leave him on the way home from Vanozza. Alexander,
so far from suspecting Caesar at this time, ap- pointed him Giovanni’s
executor. The first known mention of Caesar as the possible murderer
occurs in a letter written by the Ferrarese ambassador Pigna on February
22, 1498, eight months after the event. Not till Caesar</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>417</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>had shown his character in all its ruthless force did popular opinion
connect him with the crime; then Machiavelli and Guicciardini agreed in
laying it at his door. He might have been capable of it at a later stage
of his de- velopment, had Giovanni opposed him in some vital policy; but
of this particular murder he was almost certainly innocent. 52</p>
<p>When the Pope had recovered his self-control he called a consistory
of the cardinals (June 19, 1497), received their condolences, told them
that he had “loved the Duke of Gandia more than anyone else in the
world,” and attributed the blow — “the heaviest that could have
befallen” him— to God as a punishment for his sins. He went on: “We on
our part are resolved to amend our life, and to reform the Church. . . .
Henceforth benefices shall be given only to deserving persons, and in
accordance with the votes of the cardinals. We renounce all nepotism. We
will begin the reform with our- selves, and so proceed through all ranks
of the Church till the whole work is accomplished.” 53 A committee of
six cardinals was appointed to draw up a program of reform. It labored
earnestly, and presented to Alexander a bull of reform so excellent that
if its provisions had been put into effect they might have saved the
Church from both the Reformation and the Counter Reformation. But when
Alexander faced the question how the revenues of the papacy, without the
fees paid for ecclesiastical appointments, could finance the papal
government, he found no acceptable answer. Meanwhile Louis XII was
preparing a second French invasion of Italy, and soon Caesar Borgia
proposed to recapture the Papal States from their recalcitrant “vic -
ars.” The dream of a powerful political structure that would gi ve the
Church a physical and financial leverage in a rebellious and fluent
world absorbed the spirit of the Pope; he deferred the reforms from day
to day; at last he forgot them in the exciting successes of a son who
was conquering a realm for him and making him every ounce a king.</p>

<li>CAESAR BORGIA</li>
</ol>
<p>Alexander had many reasons to be proud of his now oldest son. Caesar
was blonde of hair and beard, as many Italians wanted to be; keen of
eye, tall and straight, strong, and a stranger to fear. Of him, as of
Leonardo, the story was told that he could twist a horseshoe with his
bare hands. He rode with wild control the spirited horses collected for
his stable; he went to the hunt with the eagerness of a hound sniffing
blood. During the jubilee he astonished a crowd by decapitating a bull
with one stroke in a bullbaiting contest in a Roman square; on January
2, 1502, in a formal bullfight ar-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>ranged by him in the Piazza San Pietro, he rode into the enclosure
with nine other Spaniards, and attacked singlehanded, with his pike, the
more fero- cious of two bulls let loose there; dismounting, he played
torero for a while; then, having sufficiently proved his courage and
skill, he left the arena to the professionals. 54 He introduced the
sport into the Romagna as well as at Rome; but after a few amateur
matadors had been gored it was sent back to Spain.</p>
<p>To think of him as an ogre is to miss him widely. One
contemporary</p>
<p>called him “a young man of great and surpassing cleverness and
excellent disposition, cheerful, even merry, and always in good
spirits”; 55 another described him as “far superior in looks and wit to
his brother the Duke of Gandia.” 5 ® Men noted his grace of manner, his
simple but costly g arb, his commanding glance, and air of one who felt
that he inherited the world. Women admired but did not love him; they
knew that he took them lightly and lightly cast them aside. He had
studied law in the University of Pe- rugia, enough to sharpen the
natural shrewdness of his mind. He spared little time for books or
“culture,” though like everybody he wrote verses now and then; later he
flaunted a poet on his staff. He had a discriminating appreciation of
the arts; when Cardinal Raffaello Riario refused to buy a Cupid because
it was no antique but the work of an unknown Florentine youth,
Michelangelo Buonarroti, Caesar gave a good price for it.</p>
<p>He was clearly not made for an ecclesiastical career, but Alexander,
hav- ing bishoprics rather than principalities at his disposal, made him
archbishop of Valencia (1492), then cardinal (1493). No one took such
appointments as religious; they were means of supplying income to youths
who had in- fluential relatives, and who might be trained for the
practical management of ecclesiastical property and personnel. Caesar
took minor orders, but never became a priest. Since canon law excluded
bastards from the car- dinalate, Alexander, in a bull of September 19,
1493, declared him the legit- imate son o f Vanozza and d’Arignano. It
was inconvenient that in a bull of August 16, 1482, Sixtus IV had
described Caesar as the son of “Rodrigo, bishop and vice- chancellor.”
The public winked and smiled, accustomed to see legal fictions veil
untimely truths.</p>
<p>In 1497, shortly after Giovanni’s death, Caesar went to Naples as
papal legate, and had the thrill of crowning a king. Perhaps the touch
of a crown stirred his blood. On his return to Rome he importuned his
father to let him renounce his ecclesiastical career. There was no way
of releasing him from it except through Alexander’s frank admission to
the college of car - dinals that Caesar was his illegitimate son; it was
so done, and the appoint-</p>

<p>ment of the young bastard to the cardinalate was duly declared
invalid (August 17, 1498). 57 His illegitimacy restored, Caesar turned
with zest to the game of politics.</p>
<p>Alexander hoped that Federigo III, King of Naples, would accept
Caesar as husband for. his daughter Carlotta, but Federigo had different
tastes. Deeply offended, the Pope turned to France, hoping to secure its
help in reclaiming the Papal States. An opportunity came when Louis XII
asked for the annulment of a marriage that had been forced upon him in
his youth, and which, he claimed, had never been consummated. In
October, 1498, Alexander sent Caesar to France bearing a decree of
divorce for the King, and 200,000 ducats with which to woo a bride.
Pleased with the divorce, further pleased by a papal dispensation to
marry Anne of Brit- tany, widow of Charles VIII, Louis offered Caesar
the hand of Charlotte d’Albret, sister to the king of Navarre; moreover,
he made Caesar duke of Valentinois and Diois, two French territories to
which the papacy had some legal claim. In May, 1499, the new Duke —
Valentino, as he was henceforth called in Italy — married the good,
beautiful, and wealthy Charlotte; and Rome, told the news by Alexander,
lit bonfires of rejoicing over the mar- riage of their prince. The
marriage committed the papacy to an alliance with a king who was openly
planning to invade Italy and take Milan and Naples. Alexander was as
guilty in 1499 as Lodovico and Savonarola had been in 1494. This
alliance undid all the work of the Holy League that Alexander had helped
to form in 1495, and it prepared the scene for the wars of Julius II.
Caesar Borgia was among the notables who escorted Louis XII into Milan
on October 6, 1499; Castiglione, who was there, de- scribed Duke
Valentino as the tallest and handsomest man in all the King’s stately
retinue. 58 His pride matched his appearance. His ring bore the in-
scription, Fays ce que dois, advien que pourra —“Do what you must,</p>
<p>whate’er betide.” His sword was engraved with scenes from the life of
Julius Caesar, and bore two mottoes: on one side, Alea iacta erf — “The
die is cast”; on the other, Aut Caesar aut nullus — “Either Caesar or
nobody.” 59</p>
<p>In this bold youth and happy warrior Alexander found at last the
general he had long sought to lead the armed forces of the Church in the
reconquest of the Papal States. Louis contributed three hundred French
lances, four thousand Gascons and Swiss were recruited, and two thousand
Italian mer- cenaries. It was a small army with which to overcome a
dozen despots, but Caesar was eager for the adventure. To add spiritual
to military weapons, the Pope issued a bull solemnly declaring that
Caterina Sforza and her son Ottaviano held Imola and Forli — Pandolfo
Malatesta held Rimini — Giulio</p>
<p>420 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Varano held Camerino — Astorre Manfredi held Faenza — Guidobaldo held
Urbino — Giovanni Sforza held Pesaro — only by usurping lands, property,
and rights long pertaining in law and justice to the Church; that they
were all tyrants who had abused their powers and exploited their
subjects; and that they must now resign or be expelled by force. 80
Possibly, as some charged, Alexander dreamed of welding these
principalities into a kingdom for his son; it is unlikely, for Alexander
must have known that neither his successors nor the other states of
Italy would long tolerate a usurpation more illegal and unwelcome than
any that it would have replaced. Caesar himself may have dreamed of such
a consummation; Machiavelli hoped so, and would have rejoiced to see so
strong a hand unite all Italy and expel all invaders. But to the end of
his life Caesar protested that he had no other aim than to win the
States of the Church for the Church, and would be content to be governor
of the Romagna as a vassal of the pope. 61</p>
<p>In January, 1500, Caesar and his army marched over the Apennines to
Forli. Imola surrendered at once to his deputy, and the citizens of
Forli threw open the gates to welcome him; but Caterina Sforza, as she
had done twelve years before, bravely held the citadel with her
garrison. Caesar offered her easy terms; she preferred to fight. After a
brief siege the papal troops forced their way into the rocca, and put
the defenders to the sword. Caterina was sent to Rome, and was lodged as
an unwilling guest in the Belvedere wing of the Vatican. She refused to
resign her right to rule Forli and Imola; she tried to escape, and was
transferred to Sant’ Angelo. After eighteen months she was released, and
entered a nunnery. She was a brave woman, but quite a virago. 62 “She
was a feudal ruler of the worst type, and in her dominions, as elsewhere
in the Romagna, Caesar was regarded as an avenger commissioned by Heaven
to redress ages of oppression and wrong.” 63</p>
<p>But Caesar’s first triumph was brief. His foreign troops mutinied
because Caesar had insufficient funds to pay them; they were hardly
appeased when Louis XII recalled the French detachment to help him
recapture the Milan that Lodovico had for a moment regained. Caesar led
his remaining army back to Rome, and received almost the honors of a
victorious Roman gen- eral. Alexander gloried in his son’s success; “the
Pope,” reported the Ve - netian ambassador, “is more cheerful than
ever.” 64 He appointed Caesar papal vicar for the conquered cities, and
began to lean fondly on his son’s advice. The receipts from the jubilee
and from the sale of red hats re- plenished the treasury, and Caesar
could now plan a second campaign. He offered a convincing sum to Paolo
Orsini to join the papal forces with his</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>421</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>armed men; Paolo came, and several other nobles followed suit; with
this clever stroke Caesar enlarged his army and protected Rome from
baronial raids during the absence of the papal troops beyond the
Apennines. Per- haps by similar inducements, and the promise of spoils,
he enlisted the serv- ices and soldiers of Gianpaolo Baglioni, lord of
Perugia, and engaged Vitellozzo Vitelli to lead the artillery. Louis XII
sent him a small regiment of lancers, but Caesar was no longer dependent
upon French reinforce- ments. In September, 1500, at Alexander’s urging,
he attacked the castles occupied by hostile Colonna and Savelli in
Latium. One after another sur- rendered. Soon Alexander was enabled to
make a tour in safety and tri- umph through regions long lost to the
papacy. He was received every- where with popular acclaim, 65 for the
feudal barons had not been loved by their subjects.</p>
<p>When Caesar set out on his second major campaign (October, 1500), he
had an army of 14,000 men, with a retinue of poets, prelates, and
prosti- tutes to service his troops. Anticipating their arrival,
Pandolfo Malatesta vacated Rimini, and Giovanni Sforza fled from Pesaro;
the two cities wel- comed Caesar as a liberator. At Faenza Astorre
Manfredi resisted, and the people supported him loyally. Borgia offered
generous terms, Manfredi rejected them. The siege lasted all winter;
finally Faenza surrendered on Caesar’s promise of leniency to all. He
beh aved handsomely to the citizens, and was so warm in praising
Manfredi’s resolute defense that the defeated apparently fell in love
with the victor, and remained with him as part of his staff or retinue.
Astorre’s younger brother did the same, though bot h were free to go
wherever they wished. 66 For two months they followed Caesar in all his
wanderings, and were treated with all respect. Then sud- denly, on
reaching Rome, they were thrown into the Castel Sant’ Angelo. There they
remained for a year; then, on June 2, 1502, their bodies were thrown up
by the Tiber. What made Caesar — or Alexander — condemn them is not
known. Like a hundred other strange events in the history of the
Borgias, the case remains a mystery that only the uninformed can
solve.</p>
<p>Caesar, now adding duke of Romagna to his titles, studied the map,
and decided to complete the task assigned him by his father. Camerino
and Urbino remained to be taken. Urbino, though doubtless papal in law,
was almost a model state as politics then went; it seemed a disgraceful
thing to depose so loved a couple as Guidobaldo and Elisabetta; and
perhaps they would now have consented to be papal vicars in fact as well
as name. But Caesar argued that the city blocked his easiest avenue to
the Adriatic, and might, in hostile hands, cut off his communications
with Pesaro and Rimini.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>We do not know if Alexander agreed; it seems incredible, for about
this time he persuaded Guidobaldo to lend the papal army his artillery.
67 It is more likely that Caesar deceived his father, or changed his own
plans. On June 12, 1502, now with Leonardo da Vinci as his chief
engineer, he set out on his third campaign, apparently headed for
Camerino. Suddenly he turned north, and approached Urbino so rapidly
that its invalid ruler had barely time to escape, leaving the city to
fall undefended into Caesar’s hands (June 21). If this move was made
with Alexander’s knowledge and con - sent, it was one of the most
despicable treacheries in history, though Ma- chiavelli would have been
thrilled by its subtlety. The victor treated the inhabitants with feline
gentleness, but appropriated the precious art col- lection of the fallen
Duke, and sold it to pay his troops.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his general Vitelli, apparently on his own authority,
seized Arezzo, long since an appanage of Florence. The shocked Signory
sent the bishop of Volterra, with Machiavelli, to appeal to Caesar at
Urbino. He received them with successful charm. “I am not here to play
the tyrant,” he told them, “but to extinguish tyrants.” 68 He agreed to
check Vitelli and restore Arezzo to Florentine allegiance; in return he
demanded a definite policy of mutual friendliness between Florence and
himself. The bishop thought him sincere, and Machiavelli wrote to the
Signory with undiplo- matic enthusiasm:</p>
<p>This lord is splendid and magnificent, and is so bold that there
is</p>
<p>no enterprise so great that it does not seem to him small. To
gain</p>
<p>glory and dominions he robs himself of repose, and knows neither</p>
<p>danger nor fatigue. He comes to a place before his intentions are</p>
<p>understood. He makes himself well liked among his soldiers, and has
chosen the best men in Italy. These things make him victorious and</p>
<p>formidable, with the aid of perpetual good fortune. 69</p>
<p>On July 20 Camerino surrendered to Caesar’s lieutenants, and the
Papal States were papal again. Directly or by proxy Caesar gave them
such good government as seemed to vindicate his claim to be a deposer of
tyrants; later all of them but Urbino and Faenza would mourn his fall.
70 — Hearing that Gianfrancesco Gonzaga (Elisabetta’s brother and
Isabella’s husband) had gone with several other prominent men to Milan
to turn Louis XII against him, Caesar hurried across Italy, confronted
his enemies, and quickly regained the favor of the King (August, 1502).
It is deserving of note that up to this point, and even after his most
questionable exploit, a</p>

Venice, though it had made him an honorary citizen ( gentiluomo di
Venezia), was not happy to see the Papal States so strong again, and
controlling so much of the Adriatic shore. Florence fretted at the
thought that Forli, only eight miles from Florentine territory, was in
the hands of an incalculable and un- scrupulous young genius of
statecraft and war. Pisa offered itself to his rule (December, 1502); he
politely refused; but what if he changed his course — as on the way to
Camerino? The gifts that Isabella sent him were per- haps a blind to
disguise the resentment she and Mantua felt against his rape of Urbino.
The Colonna and Savelli, and in less degree the Orsini, had been ruined
by his victories, and merely bided their time to raise some coalition
against him. His own “best men,” who had led his cohorts bri lliantly,
were not sure but that he might attack their territories next, some of
which were also claimed by the Church. Gianpaolo Baglioni trembled for
his hold on Perugia, Giovanni Bentivoglio for his rule in Bologna; Paolo
Orsini and Francesco Orsini, Duke of Gravina, wondered how long it would
be be- fore Caesar would do to the Orsini clan what he had done to the
Colonna. Vitelli, raging at being forced to relinquish Arezzo, invited
these men, and Oliverotto of Fermo, and Pandolfo Petrucci of Siena, and
representatives of Guidobaldo, to meet at La Magione on Lake Trasimene
(September,</p>
<p>1502). There they agreed to turn their troops against Caesar, capture
and depose him, end his rule in the Romagna and the Marches, and restore
the dispossessed lords. It was a formidable plot, whose success would
have brought to a sorry issue the best-laid plans of Alexander and his
son.</p>
<p>The conspiracy began with brilliant victories. Revolts were organized
in Urbino and Camerino, with the support of the people; the papal
garrisons there were expelled; Guidobaldo returned to his palace
(October 18, 1 502 ) ; everywhere the fallen lords raised their heads
and planned to return to power. Caesar suddenly found that his
lieutenants would not obey him, and that his forces were reduced to a
point where he could not possibly hold his conquests. In this crisis
Cardinal Ferrari opportunely died; Alex- ander hurriedly appropriated
the 50,000 ducats left by him, and sold some of the Cardinal’s
benefices; he turned ove r the receipts to Caesar, who rapidly raised a
new army of six thousand men. In the meantime Alexander nego- tiated
individually with the conspirators, made them fair promises, and won so
many of them back to obedience that by the end of October they had</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>424</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>all made their peace with Caesar; it was an astonishing feat of
diplomacy. Caesar received their apologies with silent skepticism; and
he noted that though Guidobaldo again fled from Urbino, the Orsini still
held the duchy’s strongholds with their troops.</p>
<p>In December Caesar’s lieutenants, at his bidding, besieged
Senigallia, on the Adriatic. The town soon yielded, but the governor of
the castle refused to surrender it except to Caesar himself. A messenger
was sent to the Duke at Cesena; he hastened down the coast, followed by
twenty-eight hundred soldiers especially devoted to him. Arriving at
Senigallia he greeted with apparent cordiality the four leaders of the
conspiracy — Vitellozzo Vitelli, Paolo and Francesco Orsini, and
Oliverotto. He invited them to a confer- ence with him in the governor’s
palace; when they came he had them ar - rested; and that very night
(December 31, 1502) he had Vitelli and Oli- verotto strangled. The two
Orsini were kept in prison till Caesar could communicate with his
father; apparently Alexander’s views agreed with his son’s; and on
January 1 8 the two men were put to death. 71</p>
<p>Caesar prided himself on his clever stroke at Senigallia; he thought
Italy should thank him for ridding it so neatly of four men who were not
only feudal usurpers of Church lands but had been reactionary oppressors
of helpless subjects. Perhaps he felt a qualm or two, for he excused
himself to Machiavelli: “It is proper to snare those who a re proving
themselves past masters in the art of snaring others.” 72 Machiavelli
fully agreed with him, and considered Caesar, at this time, the bravest
and wisest man in Italy. Paolo Giovio, historian and bishop, called the
quadruple extinction of the conspirators bellissimo inganno —a “most
lovely ruse.” 73 Isabella d’Este, playing safe, sent Caesar
congratulations, and a hundred masks to amuse him “after the fatigues
and struggles of this glorious expedition.” Louis XII hailed the coup as
“a deed worthy of the great days of Rome.” 74</p>
<p>Alexander was now free to express his full rage at the conspiracy
against his son and the reclaimed cities of the Church. He claimed to
have evidence that Cardinal Orsini had plotted with his relatives to
assassinate Caesar; 76 he had the Cardinal and several other suspects
arrested (January 3, 1503); he seized the Cardinal’s palace, and
confiscated all his goods. The Cardinal died in prison on February 22,
probably through excitement and exhaus- tion; Rome speculated that the
Pope had had him poisoned. Alexander ad- vised Caesar to root out the
Orsini completely from Rome and the Cam- pagna. Caesar was not so
anxious; perhaps he too was exhausted; he delayed returning to the
capital, and then set out unwillingly 76 to besiege Giulio Orsini’s
mighty fortress at Ceri (March 14, 1503). In this siege— perhaps</p>

<p>in others — Borgia used some of Leonardo’s war machines; one was a
mov - able tower holding three hundred men and capable of being raised
to the top of the enemy’s walls.“ Giulio surrendered, and went with
Caesar to the Vatican to ask for peace; the Pope granted it on condition
that all Or- sini castles in papal territory should be given up to the
Church; it was done. In the meantime Perugia and Fermo had quietly
accepted the governors sent them by Caesar. Bologna was still
unredeemed, but Ferrara had joy- fully received Lucrezia Borgia as its
duchess. Aside from these two major principalities — which would occupy
Alex ander’s successors— the reconquest of the Papal States was
complete, and Caesar Borgia, at twenty-eight, found himself the governor
of a realm equaled in size, in the peninsula, only by the Kingdom of
Naples. He was now by common consent the most re- markable and powerful
man in Italy.</p>
<p>For a time he remained in unwonted quiet at the Vatican. We should
have expected him at this point to send for his wife; he did not. He had
left her with her family in France, and she had borne him a child during
his wars; occasionally he wrote to her and sent her gifts; but he never
saw her again. The Duchesse de Valentinois lived a modest and retired
life in Bourges, or in the chateau de La Motte-Feuilly in the Dauphine,
waiting hopefully to be sent for, or to have her husband come to her.
When he was ruined and deserted she tried to go to him; when he died she
hung her house with black, and remained in mourning for him until her
death. Per- haps he would have sent for her later, had he been given
more than a few months of peace; more likely he looked upon the marriage
as purely po- litical, and felt no obligation to tenderness. There was
apparently only a modicum of tenderness in him, and he kept most of that
for Lucrezia, whom he loved as much as he could love a woman. Even when
hurrying from Urbino to Milan to circumvent his foes with Louis XII, he
had gone considerably out of his way to visit his sister at Ferrara,
then dangerously ill. Returning from Milan he stopped there again, held
her in his arms while physicians bled her, and stayed with her till she
was out of danger . 78 Caesar was not made for marriage; he had
mistresses, but none for long; he was too consumed by the will to power
to let any woman enter possessively into his life.</p>
<p>In Rome he lived in privacy, almost in concealment. He worked at
night and was rarely seen by day. But he worked hard, even in this
period of seeming rest; he kept close watch on his appointees in the
States of the Church, punished those who misused their position, had one
appointee put to death for cruelty and exploitation, and always found
time to see men</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>who needed his instructions on the government of the Romagna or the
maintenance of order in Rome. Those who knew him respected his shrewd
intelligence, his capacity for going directly to the heart of the
matter, for seizing every opportunity that chance presented, and for
taking quick, de- cisive, and effective action. He was popular with his
soldiers, who secretly admired the saving severity of his discipline.
They highly approved of the bribes, stratagems, and deceits by which he
reduced the number and per- sistence of his enemies and the battles and
casualties of his troops. 70 Diplo- mats were chagrined to find that
this swift-moving and fearless young general could outthink them and
outreason them in their shrewdest subtle- ties, and could, at need,
match all their charm and tact and eloquence. 80</p>
<p>His flair for secrecy made him an easy victim for the satirists of
Italy, and for the ugly rumors that hostile ambassadors or deposed
aristocrats might invent or spread; it is impossible today to separate
fact from fiction in these lurid reports. A favorite story was that
Alexander and his son made a prac- tice of arresting rich ecclesiastics
on trumped up charges, and releasing them on the payment of large
ransoms or fines; so, it was alleged, the bishop of Cesena, for a crime
whose nature was not divulged, was cast into Sant’ Angelo, and was freed
on paying 10,000 ducats to the Pope. 81 We cannot say whether this was
justice or robbery; in fairness to Alexander we should bear in mind that
it was then the custom of both secular and ecclesiastical courts to make
crime pay the court by replacing expensive imprisonment with lucrative
fines. According to the Venetian ambassador Giustiniani and the
Florentine ambassador Vittorio Soderini, Jews were frequently arrested
on charges of heresy, and could prove their orthodoxy only by
substantial contributions to the papal treasury. 82 It is possible; but
Rome was known for its relatively decent treatment of the Jews, and no
Jew was considered a heretic — or was prosecuted by the Inquisition —
for being a Jew.</p>
<p>Many rumors charged the Borgias with poisoning rich cardinals to ac-
celerate the reversion of their estates to the Church. Some such
casualties seemed so well attested — rather by repetition than by
evidence — that Prot- estant historians generally accepted them as late
as the judicious Jacob Burckhardt (1818- 97);“ an d the Catholic
historian Pastor believed it “ex - tremely probable that Caesar poisoned
Cardinal Michiel in order to obtain the money that he wanted.” 84 This
conclusion was founded on the fact that under Julius II (extremely
hostile to Alexander) a subdeacon, Aquino da Colloredo, being put to the
torture, confessed that he had poisoned Cardinal Michiel at the behest
of Alexander and Caesar. 85 A twentieth-century his- torian may be
excused for being skeptical of confessions elicited by torture.</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>An enterprising statistician has shown that the death rate among
cardinals was no higher in Alexander’s pontificate than before or
afterward; 86 but there is no doubt that Rome, in the last three years
of that reign, thought it dangerous to be a cardinal and rich. 87
Isabella d’Este wrote to her husband to be careful what he said about
Caesar, for “he does not scruple to con - spire against those of his own
blood”; 88 apparently she accepted the tale that he had killed the Duke
of Gandia. Roman gossip talked about a slow poison, cantarella, whose
base was arsenic, and which, dropped as a powder upon food or into drink
— even into the sacramental wine of the Mass — would produce a leisurely
death difficult to trace to its human cause. His- torians now generally
reject the slow poisons of the Renaissance as legend- ary, but believe
that in one or two cases the Borgias poisoned rich cardi- nals. 80 *
Further research may reduce these cases to zero.</p>
<p>Worse stories were told of Caesar. To amuse Alexander and Lucrezia,
we are assured, he released into a courtyard several prisoners who had
been sentenced to death, and, from a safe point, showed his bowmanship
by shooting fatal arrows into one after another of the convicts as they
sought some refuge from his shafts. 80 Our sole authority for this tale
is the Vene- tian envoy Capello; it is rather less probable that Caesar
did this than that a diplomat should lie. Much history of the
Renaissance popes has been writ- ten on the authority of war propaganda
and diplomatic lies.</p>
<p>The most incredible of the Borgia horrors appears in the usually
reliable diary of Alexander’s master of ceremonies, Burchard. Under
October 30, 1501, the Diarium describes a dinner in the apartment of
Caesar Borgia in the Vatican, at which nude courtesans chased chestnuts
scattered over the floor while Alexander and Lucrezia looked on. 91 The
story appears also in the Perugian historian Matarazzo, who took it not
from Burchard (for the Diarium was still secret) but from gossip that
ranged out of Rome through Italy; “the thing was known far and wide,” he
says. 02 If so, it is strange that the Ferrarese ambassador, who was in
Rome at the time, and was later com- missioned to investigate the morals
of Lucrezia and her fitness to marry Alfonso, son of Duke Ercole, made
no mention of the story in his report, but (as we shall see) gave a most
favorable account of her; either he was bribed by Alexander, or he
ignored unverified gossip. But how did the story get into Burchard’s
diary? He does not profess to have been present,</p>
<ul>
<li>“The general tendency of investigation, while utterly shattering all
idle attempts to rep - resent Alexander as a model pope, has been to
relieve him of the most odious imputations against his character. There
remains the charge of secret poisoning from motives of cupidity, which
indeed appears established, or nearly so, only in a single instance; but
this may imply others.”— Richard Garnett in The Cambridge Modern History
, I, 242.</li>

<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>and could hardly be, for he was a man of sturdy morals. Normally he
in- cluded in his notes only such events as he had witnessed, or such as
had been reported to him on good authority. Was the story interpolated
into the manuscript? Of the original manuscript only twenty-six pages
survive, all concerning the period following Alexander’s final illness.
Of the re - mainder of the Diarium only copies exist. All these copies
carry the story. It may have been interpolated by a hostile scribe who
thought to liven a dry chronicle with a juicy tale; or Burchard may for
once have allowed gossip to creep into his notes, or the original may
have marked it as gossip. Prob- ably the story was based on an actual
banquet, and the lurid fringe was added by fancy or spite. The
Florentine ambassador Francesco Pepi, al- ways hostile to the Borgias
since Florence was almost always at odds with them, reported, on the
morrow of the affair, that the Pope had stayed up till a late hour in
the apartments of Caesar the night before, and there had been “dancing
and laughter”; 93 there is no mention of the courtesans. It is
incredible that a pope who was at this time making every effort to marry
his daughter to the heir of the duchy of Ferrara should have risked the
marriage and a vital diplomatic alliance by allowing Lucrezia to witness
such a spectacle . 94</p>
<p>But let us look at Lucrezia.</p>
<p>V. LUCREZIA BORGIA: I480-I519</p>
<p>Alexander admired, perhaps feared, his son, but he loved his daughter
with all the emotional intensity of his nature. He seems to have taken
pro- founder pleasure in her moderate beauty, in her long golden hair
(so heavy that it gave her headaches), in the rhythm of her light form
dancing , 95 and in the filial devotion that she gave him through all
contumely and bereave- ments, than he had ever derived from the charms
of Vanozza or Giulia. She was not particularly fair, but she was
described in her youth as dolce ciera, sweet face; and amid all the
coarseness and looseness of her times and her environment, through all
the disillusionments of divorce and the horror of seeing her husband
murdered almost before her eyes, she kept this “sweet face” to her pious
end, for it was a frequent theme in Ferrarese poetry. Pinturicchio’s
portrait of her, in the Borgia apartment of the Vatican, agrees well
with this description of her in her youth.</p>
<p>Like all Italian girls who could afford it, she went to a convent for
her education. At an unknown age she passed from the house of her mother
Vanozza to that of Donna Adriana Mila, a cousin of Alexander. There
she</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>429</p>
<p>formed a lifelong friendship with Adriana’s daughter -in-law Giulia
Farnese, alleged mistress of her father. Favored with every good fortune
except legitimacy, Lucrezia grew up in a gay and joyous girlhood, and
Alexander was happy in her happiness.</p>
<p>This carefree youth was ended by marriage. Probably she was not of-
fended when her father chose a husband for her; that was then normal
pro- cedure for all good girls, and produced no more unhappiness than
our own reliance on the selective wisdom of romantic love. Alexander,
like any ruler, thought that the marriages of his children should
advance the inter- ests of the state; this too, doubtless, seemed
reasonable to Lucrezia. Naples was then hostile to the papacy, and Milan
was hostile to Naples; so her first marriage bound her, at the age of
thirteen, to Giovanni Sforza, aged twenty-six, lord of Pesaro and nephew
to Lodovico, regent of Milan</p>
<p>(1493). Alexander amused himself paternally by arranging a handsome
home for the couple in Cardinal Zeno’s palace, close to the Vatican.</p>
<p>But Sforza had to live at Pesaro part of the time, and took his young
bride with him. She languished on those distant shores, far from her
doting father and the excitement and splendor of Rome; and after a few
months she returned to the capital. Later Giovanni joined her there; but
after Easter of 1497 he stayed at Pesaro and she at Rome. On June 14
Alexander asked him to consent to an annulment on the ground of the
husband’s im - potence — the only ground recognized by canon law for
annulling a valid marriage. Lucrezia, whether in grief or in shame, or
to circumvent scandal- mongers, retired to a convent. 96 A few days
later her brother the Duke of Gandia was slain, and the delicate wits of
Rome suggested that he had been murdered by agents of Sforza for
attempting to seduce Lucrezia. 97 Her husband denied his impotence, and
hinted that Alexander was guilty of incest with his daughter. The Pope
appointed a committee, headed by two cardinals, to inquire into whether
the marriage had ever been consummated; Lucrezia took oath that it had
not, and they assured Alexander that she was still a virgin. Lodovico
proposed to Giovanni that he should demonstrate his potency before a
committee including the papal legate at Milan; Gio- vanni forgivably
refused. However, he signed a formal admission that the marriage had not
been consummated; he returned to Lucrezia her dowry of 31,000 ducats;
and on December 20, 1497, the marriage was annulled. Lucrezia, who had
borne no offspring to Giovanni, bore children to both her later
husbands; but Sforza’s thi rd wife, in 1505, gave birth to a son
presumably his own. 98</p>
<p>It was formerly assumed that Alexander had broken the marriage in</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>43O</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>order to make a politically more profitable marriage; there is no
evidence for this assumption; it is more likely that Lucrezia told the
pitiful truth of the matter. But Alexander could not let her remain
husbandless. Seeking a rapprochement with the papacy’s bitter enemy,
Naples, he proposed to King Federigo the union of Lucrezia with Don
Alfonso, Duke of Bisceglie, the bastard son of Federigo ’s heir Alfonso
II. The King agreed, and a for - mal betrothal was signed (June, 1498).
Federigo’s proxy on this occasion was Cardinal Sforza, uncle to the
divorced Giovanni. Lodovico of Milan also had encouraged Federigo to
accept the plan.“ Apparently Giovanni’s uncles felt no resentment at the
annulment of his marriage. In August the wedding was celebrated in the
Vatican.</p>
<p>Lucrezia facilitated matters by falling in love with her husband. It
helped that she could mother him, for she was eighteen now, and he was a
child of seventeen. But it was their misfortune to be important;
politics entered even their marriage bed. Caesar Borgia, rejected in
Naples, went to France for a bride (October, 1498); Alexander entered
into alliance with Louis XII, the declared enemy of Naples; the young
Duke of Bisceglie was in- creasingly ill at ease in a Rome filling up
with French agents; suddenly he fled to Naples. Lucrezia was
brokenhearted. To appease her and heal the breach, Alexander appointed
her regent of Spoleto (August, 1499); Al- fonso rejoined her there;
Alexander visited them at Nepi, reassured the youth, and brought them
back to Rome. There Lucrezia was delivered of a son, who was named
Rodrigo after her father.</p>
<p>But again their happiness was brief. Whether because Alfonso was un-
controllably high-strung, or because Caesar Borgia symbolized the French
alliance, Alfonso took a passionate dislike to him, which Borgia
disdainfully returned. On the night of July 15, 1500, some bravos
attacked Alfonso as he was leaving St. Peter’s. He received several
wounds, but managed to reach the house of the Cardinal of Santa Maria in
Portico. Lucrezia, sum- moned to him, fainted on seeing his condition;
she soon recovered, and, with his sister Sancia, tended him anxiously.
Alexander sent a guard of sixteen men to protect him from further
injury. Alfonso slowly conva- lesced. One day he saw Caesar walking in a
nearby garden. Convinced that this was the man who had hired his
assassins, Alfonso seized bow and arrow, aimed at Caesar, and shot to
kill. The weapon narrowly missed its mark. Caesar was not the man to
give an enemy a second chance; he called his guards and sent them up to
Alfonso’s room, apparently with orders to slay him; they pressed a
pillow upon his face until he died, perhaps under the eyes of his sister
and his wife. 100 Alexander accepted Caesar’s account</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>of the matter, gave Alfonso a quiet burial, and did what he could to
console the inconsolable Lucrezia.</p>
<p>She retired to Nepi, and there signed her letters la infelicissima
princi- pessa, “the most miserable princess,” and ordered Masses for the
repose of Alfonso’s soul. Strange to relate, Caesar visited her at Nepi
(October i,</p>
<ol start="1499" type="1">
<li>only two and a half months after Alfonso’s death, and stayed over -
night as her guest. Lucrezia was malleable and patient; she seems to
have looked upon the killing of her husband as the natural reaction of
her brother to an attempt upon his life. She does not appear to have
believed that Caesar had hired the unsuccessful assassins of Alfonso,
though this seems the most probable explanation of another Renaissance
mystery. During the remain- der of her life she gave many proofs that
her love for her brother had survived all trials. Perhaps because he
too, like her father, loved her with Spanish intensity, the wits of
Rome, or rather of hostile Naples, 101 continued to accuse her of
incest; one syn optic scribe called her “the Pope’s daughter, wife, and
daughter-in- law.” 102 This, too, she bore with quiet resignation. All
students of the epoch are now agreed that these charges were cruel
calumnies, 103 but such libels formed her fame for centuries.*</li>
</ol>
<p>That Caesar killed Alfonso with a view to remating her to better
political result is improbable. After a period of mourning she was
offered to an Orsini, then to a Colonna — matches hardly as advantageous
as that with the son of the heir to the Neapolitan throne. Not till
November, 1500, do we hear of Alexander proposing her to Duke Ercole of
Ferrara for Ercole’s son Alfonso; 101 and not till September, 1501, was
she betrothed to him. Presumably Alexander hoped that a Ferrara ruled by
a son-in-law, and a Mantua long since bound to Ferrara by marriage,
would in effect be papal states; and Caesar seconded the plan as
offering greater security for his conquests, and an elegant background
for an attack upon Bologna. Ercole and Alfonso hesitated, for reasons
already retailed. Alfonso had been of- fered the hand of the Countess of
Angouleme, but Alexander topped his offer with the pledge of an immense
dowry, and practical remission of the annual tribute that Ferrara had
been paying to the papacy. Even so, it is hardly credible that one of
the oldest and most prosperous ruling families in Europe would have
received Lucrezia as wife to the future duke had it believed the lurid
stories bandied about by the intellectual underworld of Rome. As neither
Ercole nor Alfonso had yet seen Lucrezia, they followed customary
procedure in such diplomatic matings, and asked the Ferrarese</p>

we look for only the best . . . Rome, December 23 , 1501 . . . .</p>
<p>Your Excellency’s servant,</p>
<p>Joannes Lucas 105</p>
<p>The Excellent and Illustrious Estensi were convinced, and sent a
magnifi- cent body of knights to escort the bride from Rome to Ferrara.
Caesar Borgia equipped two hundred cavaliers to accompany her, and
supplied musicians and buffoons to amuse the arduous travel hours.
Alexander, proud and happy, provided her with a retinue of 180 persons,
including five bishops. Vehicles especially built for the trip, and 150
mules, carried her trousseau; and this included a dress valued at 15,000
ducats (87,500? ), a hat worth 10,000 and 200 bodices costing a hundred
ducats each. 106 On January 6, 1502, having privately taken leave of her
mother Vanozza, Lu- crezia began her bridal tour across Italy to join
her fiance. Alexander, after bidding her good-by, went from point to
point on the line of procession to catch another glimpse of her as she
rode on her little Spanish horse all caparisoned in harness of leather
and gold; he watched until she and her retinue of a thousand men and
women were out of sight. He suspected that he would never see her
again.</p>
<p>Rome had probably never witnessed such an exit before, nor Ferrara
such an entry. After twenty-seven days of travel, Lucrezia was met
outside the city by Duke Ercole and Don Alfonso with a superb cavalcade
of nobles, professors, seventy-five mounted archers, eighty trumpeters
and fifers, and fourteen floats carrying highborn ladies sumptuously
dressed. When the procession reached the cathedral two ropewalkers

<p>ers and addressed compliments to Lucrezia. As the ducal palace was
reached all prisoners were given their liberty. The people rejoiced in
the beauty and smiles of their future duchess; and Alfonso was happy to
have so splendid and charming a bride. 107</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE COLLAPSE OF THE BORGIA POWER</li>
</ol>
<p>The final years of Alexander were apparently happy and prosperous.
His daughter was married into a ducal family, and was respected by all
Ferrara; his son had brilliantly accomplished his assignments as general
and administrator, and the Papal States were flourishing under excellent
govern- ment. The Venetian ambassador describes the Pope, in those last
years, as cheerful and active, apparently quite easy of conscience;
“nothing worries him.” He was seventy years old on January i, 1501, but,
reported the am - bassador, “he seems to grow younger every day.”
108</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 5, 1503, Alexander, Caesar, and some
others dined in the open air at the villa of Cardinal Adriano da
Corneto, not far from the Vatican. All remained in the gardens till
midnight, for the heat indoors was exhausting. On the 1 ith the Cardinal
was attacked by a severe fever, which lasted three days and then
subsided. On the 12th both the Pope and his son were bedded with fever
and vomiting. Rome, as usual, talked of poison; Caesar, said gossip, had
ordered the poisoning of the Cardinal to secure his fortune; by mistake
the poisoned food had been eaten by nearly all the guests. Historians
now agree with the physicians who treated the Pope, that the cause was
malarial infection, invited by prolonged exposure to the night air of
midsummer Rome. 109 In that same month malarial fever laid low half the
household of the Pope, and many of these cases proved fatal; 110 in Rome
there were hundreds of deaths from the same cause in that season.</p>
<p>Alexander lingered for thirteen days between life and death,
occasionally recovering to the extent of resuming the conferences of
diplomacy; on August 13 he played cards. The doctors bled him
repeatedly, probably once too much, depleting his natural strength. He
died on August 1 8. Soon afterward the body became black and fetid,
lending color to hasty rumors of poison. Carpenters and porters, “joking
and blaspheming,” says Burc - hard, had trouble forcing the swollen
corpse into the coffin designed for it. 111 Gossip added that a little
devil had been seen, at the moment of death, carrying Alexander’s soul
to hell. 112</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>out, the “Catalans” were chased from the city or w ere killed in
their tracks; their houses were plundered by the mob; one hundred
dwellings were burned to the ground. The armed troops of the Colonna and
the Orsini entered the city on August 22 and 23, over the protests of
the college of cardinals. Said Guicciardini, the patriotic
Florentine:</p>
<p>The whole city of Rome ran together with incredible alacrity, and</p>
<p>crowded about the corpse in St. Peter’s Church, and were not able to
satisfy their eyes with the sight of a dead serpent, who, with his im-
moderate ambition and detestable treachery, with manifold instances of
horrid cruelty and monstrous lust, and exposing to sale all things</p>
<p>without distinction, both sacred and profane, had intoxicated the</p>
<p>whole world. 113</p>
<p>Machiavelli agreed with Guicciardini: Alexander</p>
<p>did nothing but deceive, and thought of nothing else during the</p>
<p>whole of his life; nor did any man vow with stronger oaths to ob-</p>
<p>serve promises which he afterwards broke. Nevertheless he suc-</p>
<p>ceeded in everything, for he was well acquainted with this part
of</p>
<p>the world. 114</p>
<p>These condemnations were based on two assumptions: that the tales
told of Alexander in Rome were true, and that Alexander was unjustified
in the methods that he used to reclaim the Papal States. Catholic
historians, while defending Alexander’s right to restore the temporal
power of the papacy, generally join in condemning Alexander’s methods
and morals. Says the honest Pastor:</p>
<p>He was universally described as a monster, and every sort of foul</p>
<p>crime was attributed to him. Modern critical research has in many</p>
<p>points judged him more fairly and rejected some of the worst
accu-</p>
<p>sations made against him. But even though we must beware of ac-</p>
<p>cepting without examination all the tales told of Alexander by
his</p>
<p>contemporaries . . . and though the bitter wit of the Romans
found</p>
<p>its favorite exercises in tearing him to pieces without mercy, and
at- tributing to him in popular pasquinades and scholarly epigrams a
life of incredible foulness, still so much against him has been
clearly</p>
<p>proved that we are forced to reject the modern attempts at white-</p>
<p>washing him as an unworthy tampering with truth. . . . From the</p>
<p>Catholic point of view it is impossible to blame Alexander too
se-</p>
<p>verely. 115</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>Protestant historians have sometimes shown a generous lenience to
Alex- ander. William Roscoe, in his classic Life and Pontificate of Leo
X (1827), was among the first to say a good word for the Borgia
Pope:</p>
<p>Whatever were his crimes, there can be no doubt that they have</p>
<p>been highly overcharged. That he was devoted to the aggrandize-</p>
<p>ment of his family, and that he employed the authority of his
ele-</p>
<p>vated station to establish a permanent dominion in Italy in the
person of his son, cannot be doubted; but when almost all the sovereigns
of Europe were attempting to gratify their ambition by means equally</p>
<p>criminal, it seems unjust to brand the character of Alexander
with</p>
<p>any peculiar and extraordinary share of infamy in this respect.</p>
<p>While Louis of France and Ferdinand of Spain conspired together to
seize upon and divide the Kingdom of Naples, by an example of</p>
<p>treachery that can never be sufficiently execrated, Alexander might
surely think himself justified in suppressing the turbulent barons,</p>
<p>who had for ages rent the dominions of the Church with intestine</p>
<p>wars, and in subjugating the petty sovereigns of the Romagna, over
whom he had an acknowledged supremacy, and who had in general acquired
their dominions by means as unjustifiable as those which he adopted
against them. With respect to the accusation so generally</p>
<p>believed, of a criminal intercourse between him and his own daugh-
ter .. . it might not be difficult to show its improbability. In the</p>
<p>second place the vices of Alexander were accompanied, though not
compensated, by many great qualities, which in the consideration of his
character ought not to be passed over in silence. . . . Even by his</p>
<p>severest adversaries he is allowed to have ’been a man of
elevated</p>
<p>genius, of a wonderful memory, eloquent, vigilant, and dexterous in
the management of all his concerns. 116</p>
<p>Bishop Creighton summarized Alexander’s character and achievements in
general agreement with Roscoe’s judgment, and far more mercifully than
Pastor. 117 A later judgment is more favorable still — by the
Protestant</p>
<p>Alexander’s character has undoubtedly gained by the scrutiny of</p>
<p>modern historians. It was but natural that one accused of so many</p>
<p>crimes, and unquestionably the cause of many scandals, should al-</p>
<p>ternately appear as a tyrant and a voluptuary. Neither
description</p>
<p>suits him. The groundwork of his character was extreme exuberance of
nature. The Venetian ambassador calls him a carnal man, not im- plying
anything morally derogatory, but meaning a man of sanguine temperament,
unable to control his passions and emotions. This per-</p>
<p>436</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>plexed the cool unimpassioned Italians of the diplomatic type
then</p>
<p>prevalent among rulers and statesmen, and their apprehensions have
unduly prejudiced Alexander, who in truth was not less but more</p>
<p>human than most princes of his time. This excessive “carnality”</p>
<p>wrought in him for good and ill. Unrestrained by moral scruples,
or</p>
<p>by any spiritual conception of religion, he was betrayed by it
into</p>
<p>gross sensuality of one kind, though in other respects he was temper-
ate and abstemious. In the more respectable guise of family affection it
led him to outrage every principle of justice, though even here he only
performed a necessary work which could not, as one of his</p>
<p>agents said, have been accomplished by “holy water.” On the other</p>
<p>hand his geniality and joyousness preserved him from tyranny in</p>
<p>the ordinary sense of the term Asa ruler, careful of the material</p>
<p>weal of his people, he ranks among the best of his age; as a
practical statesman he was the equal of any contemporary. But his
insight was impaired by his lack of political morality; he had nothing
of the</p>
<p>higher wisdom which comprehends the characteristics and foresees the
drift of an epoch, and he did not know what a principle was . 118 Those
of us who share Alexander’s sensitivity to the charms and graces of
woman cannot find it in their hearts to throw stones at him for his
amours. His prepapal deviations were no more scandalous than those of
Aeneas Sylvius, who fares so well with the historians, or of Julius II,
whom time has graciously forgiven. It is not recorded that these two
Popes took such care of their mistresses and their children as Alexander
did of his. In- deed there was something familial and domestic about
Alexander that would have made him a relatively respectable man if the
laws of the Church, as well as the customs of Renaissance Italy and
Protestant Germany and Eng- land, had allowed the marriage of the
clergy; his sin was not against nature but against a rule of celibacy
soon to be rejected by half of Christendom. We cannot say that his
relation with Giulia Farnese was carnal; so far as we know, neither
Vanozza, nor Lucrezia, nor Giulia’s husband expressed any objection to
it; perhaps it was the simple delight of a normal man in the lure and
vivacity of a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Our judgment of Alexander’s politics must disti nguish between his
ends and his means. His purposes were entirely legitimate — to recover
the “Pat - rimony of Peter” (essentially the ancient Latium) from
disorderly feudal barons, and to regain from usurping despots the
traditional States of the Church. The methods used by Alexander and
Caesar in realizing these aims were those used by all other states then
and now — war, diplomacy, deceit, treachery, violation of treaties, and
desertion of allies. Alexander’s aban -</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>donment of the Holy League, his purchase of French soldiers and
support at the price of surrendering Milan to France, were major crimes
against Italy. And those secular means that states use, and consider
indispensable, in the lawless jungle of international strife, offend us
when employed by a pope pledged to the principles of Christ. Whatever
danger the Church ran of becoming subject to some domineering government
— as to France at Avignon — if she lost her own territories, it would
have been better for her to sacrifice all temporal power, and be as poor
again as the Galilean fisher- men, than to adopt the ways of the world
to achieve her political ends. By adopting them, and financing them, she
gained a state and lost a third of Christendom.</p>
<p>Caesar Borgia, slowly recovering from the same illness that had
killed the Pope, found himself enmeshed in a dozen unanticipated perils.
Who could have foreseen that he and his father would be incapacitated at
the same time? While the doctors bled him the Colonna and the Orsini
quickly recovered the castles that he had taken from them; the deposed
lords of the Romagna, with the encouragement of Venice, began to reclaim
their prin- cipalities; and the Roman mob, already out of hand, might at
any moment, now that Alexander was dead, plunder the Vatican and seize
the funds upon which Caesar depended for the payment of his troops. He
sent some armed men to the Vatican; they compelled Cardinal Casanuova,
at swords’ points, to give up the treasury; so Caesar repeated Caesar
after fifteen centuries. They brought back to him 100,000 ducats in
gold, and 300,000 ducats’ worth of plate and jewelry. At the same time
he sent galleys and troops to prevent his strongest enemy, Cardinal
Giuliano della Rovere, from reaching Rome. He felt that unless he could
persuade the conclave to elect a pope favorable to him, he was lost.</p>
<p>The cardinals insisted that the troops of Caesar, the Orsini, and the
Co- lonna should leave Rome before an unintimidated election could be
held. All three groups yielded. Caesar retired with his men to Civita
Castellana, while Cardinal Giuliano entered Rome and led, in the
conclave, the forces hostile to all Borgias. On September 22, 1503, the
rival factions in the College chose Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini as a
compromise pope. He took the name Pius III, in honor of his uncle Aeneas
Sylvius. He was a man of learning and integrity, though he was also the
father of a large family. 119 He was sixty-four, and suffered from an
abscess in his leg. He was friendly to Caesar, and allowed him to return
to Rome. But on Oc- tober 18 Pius III died.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>438</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>Caesar saw that he could no longer prevent the election of Cardinal
della Rovere, who was clearly the ablest man in the College. In a
private inter- view with Giuliano, Caesar effected an apparent
reconciliation: he promised Giuliano the support of the Spanish
cardinals (who were loyal to Caesar), and Giuliano promised, if elected,
to confirm him as Duke of the Romagna and commander of the papal troops.
Some other cardinals Giuliano bought with simple bribery. 120 Giuliano
della Rovere was chosen pope (October 31, 1503), and took the name
Julius II, as if to say that he too would be a Caesar, and better
Alexander. His coronation was postponed till November 26 because the
astrologers predicted for that day a propitious conjunction of
stars.</p>
<p>Venice did not wait for a lucky star; it seized Rimini, besieged
Faenza, and gave every sign of taking over as much of the Romagna as
possible before the Church could organize her forces. Julius bade Caesar
go to Imola and recruit a new army for the protection of the Papal
States. Caesar agreed, and proceeded to Ostia with a view to sailing to
Pisa. At Ostia a message from the Pope commanded him to surrender his
control of the Romagna fortresses. In a crucial error suggesting that
sickness had impaired his judgment, Caesar refused, though it should
have been obvious that he was now dealing with a man whose will was at
least as strong as his own. Julius ordered him to return to Rome; Caesar
obeyed, and was subjected to house arrest. There Guidobaldo, who now not
only was restored to Urbino but was the newly appointed commander of the
papal armies, came to see the fallen Borgia. Caesar humbled himself
before the man whom he had deposed and despoiled, gave him the
watchwords of the fortresses, returned to him some precious books and
tapestries left from the Urbino pillage, and begged his intercession
with Julius. Cesena and Forli refused to honor the watchwords until
Caesar was set at liberty; Julius refused to release him until Caesar
persuaded the Romagna castles to yield to the Pope. Lucrezia implored
her husband to help her brother; Alfonso (still only heir, not occupant,
of the ducal throne) did nothing. She appealed to Isabella d’Este;
Isabella did nothing; probably she and Alfonso knew that Julius was im-
movable. Caesar finally gave the word of surrender to his loyal
supporters in the Romagna; the Pope freed him, and he fled to Naples
(April 19,</p>
<p>1504).</p>
<p>There he was welcomed by Gonzalo de Cordoba, who gave him a safe-
conduct. His courage returning sooner than his good sense, he organized
a small force, and was preparing to sail with it to Piombino (near
Leghorn) when he was arrested by Gonzalo on orders from Ferdinand of
Spain; the</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>439</p>
<p>“Catholic King” had been urged to the action by Julius, who did not
pro - pose to have Caesar start a civil war. In August Caesar was
transported to Spain, and fretted in prison there for two years.
Lucrezia again sought to have him freed, but in vain. His deserted wife
pled for him with her brother Jean d’Albret, King of Navarre; a plan of
escape was devised; a nd in November, 1506, Caesar was again a free man,
at the court of Navarre. He soon found a chance to repay d’Albret. The
Count of Lerin, a vassal of the King, rebelled; Caesar led part of
Jean’s army against the Count’s</p>
<p>It was an honorable end to a questionable life. There are many things
in Caesar Borgia that we cannot stomach: his insolent pride, his neglect
of his faithful wife, his treatment of women as mere instruments of
passing pleasure, his occasional cruelty to his enemies — as when he
condemned to death not only Giulio Varano, lord of Camerino, but
Giulio’s two sons, and apparently ordered the death of the two Manfredi;
severities that compare shamefully with the calm mercies of the man
whose name he bore. Usually he acted on the principle that the
achievement of his purpose justified any means. He found himself
surrounded with lies, and managed to lie better than the rest until
Julius lied to him. He was almost certainly innocent of his brother
Giovanni’s death; he was probably the man who set the thugs upon the
Duke of Bisceglie. He lacked — perhaps through illness — the strength to
face his own misfortunes with courage and dignity. Only his death
brought a gleam of nobility into his life.</p>
<p>But even he had virtues. He must have had extraordinary ability to
rise so rapidly, to learn so readily the arts of leadership,
negotiation, and war. Given the difficult task of restoring, with only a
small force at his com- mand, the papal power in the Papal States, he
accomplished it with sur- prising rapidity of movement, skill of
strategy, and economy of means. Empowered to govern as well as to
conquer, he gave the Romagna the fairest rule and most prosperous peace
that it had enjoyed in centuries. Ordered to clear the Campagna of
rebellious and troublesome vassals, he did it with a celerity that
Julius Caesar himself could hardly have surpassed. With such
achievements mounting to his head, he may well have played with the
dream that Petrarch and Machiavelli entertained: to give Italy, if
necessary by conquest, the unity that would enable her to stand against
the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>44O</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>centralized strength of France or Spain.* But his victories, his
methods, his power, his dark secrecy, his swift incalculable attacks,
made him the terror instead of the liberator of Italy. The faults of his
character ruined the accomplishments of his mind. It was his basic
tragedy that he had never learned to love.</p>
<p>Except, again, Lucrezia. What a contrast she offered to her fallen
brother in the modesty and prosperity of her final years! She who in
Rome had been the subject and victim of every scandalmonger was loved by
the peo- ple of Ferrara as a model of feminine virtue. 121 She tried
there to forget all the horrors and tribulations of her past; she
recaptured, with due restraint, the joyousness of her youth, and added
to it a generous interest in the needs of others. Ariosto, Tebaldeo,
Bembo, Tito and Ercole Strozzi praised her profitably in their verse;
they called her pulcherrma virgo, “most beautiful maiden,” and no one
blinked an eye. Perhaps Bembo tried to play Abelard to her Helo’ise, and
Lucrezia now became something of a linguist, speaking S panish, Italian,
French, and reading a “little Latin and less Greek.” We are told that
she wrote poetry in all these tongues. 122 Aldus Manutius dedi- cated to
her his edition of the Strozzi poems, and implied, in the preface, that
she had offered to underwrite his great printing enterprise. 123</p>
<p>Amid all these learned concerns she found time to bear to her third
husband four sons and a daughter. Alfonso was well pleased with her in
his uneffusive way. In 1506, having occasion to leave Ferrara, he
appointed her his regent; and she fulfilled her duties with such good
judgment that the Ferrarese were inclined to pardon Alexander for having
once left her in charge of the Vatican.</p>
<p>In the last years of her brief life she devoted herself to the
education of her children, and to works of charity and mercy; she became
a pious Fran- ciscan tertiary. On June 14, 1519, she was delivered of
her seventh child, but it was stillborn. She never rose from that bed of
pain. On June 24, aged thirty-nine, Lucrezia Borgia, more sinned against
than sinning, passed away.</p>
