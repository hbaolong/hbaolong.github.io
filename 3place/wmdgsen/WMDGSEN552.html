Glory</h4>
<p>1774-83</p>
<p>I. THE HEIRS TO THE THRONE: 1 7 54-74</p>
<p>L OUIS XVI was the third son of the Dauphin Louis de France, who</p>
<p>’ was the only legitimate son of Louis XV. The Dauphin was called
Louis the Fat, for he liked to eat. He tried to overcome his obesity by
hunting, swimming, felling trees, sawing wood, and busying himself with
manual arts. 1 He retained through life his reverence for the Church;
his dearest friends were priests, and he was deeply ashamed of his
father’s adulteries. He read much, including Montesquieu and Rousseau;
he adopted the view that “the monarch is nothing but the steward of the
state’s revenues”; 2 he denied himself a trip through France because “my
whole person is not worth what it would cost the poor people.” 3 It is
remarkable how much of his character, habits, and ideas passed down to
Louis XVI.</p>
<p>His wife, Marie-Josephe of Saxony, virtuous and strong, bore him
eight children, including Louis-Joseph, Due de Bourgogne, who was killed
by an accident in 1761; Louis- Auguste, Due de Berry, born on August 23,
1754, who was to be Louis XVI; Louis-Stanislas, Comte de Provence, born
in 1755, who was to be Louis XVIII; and Charles- Philippe, Comte d’
Artois, born in 1757, who was to be Charles X. When their father died,
in 1765, Louis- Au- guste, aged eleven, became heir to the throne.</p>
<p>He was a sickly child, timid and shy, but years of country life and
simple food gave him health and strength. Like his father he was good
rather than bright. He envied the superior cleverness of his brothers,
who quite ignored his seniority. Too modest to fight back, he absorbed
himself in sports and crafts. He learned to shoot with perfect accuracy,
and to rival workingmen in using his hands and tools. He admired the
skills of the artisans who served the court; he liked to talk and work
with them, and he took on something of their manners and speech. But
also he loved books. He developed a special fondness for Fenelon; at the
age of twelve he installed a printing press in the palace at Versailles,
and, with the help of his brothers (then nine and eleven), he set the
type for a little volume which he published in 1766 as Maximes morales
et politiques tirees de T elemaque. His grandfather did not like the
maxims. “Look at that big boy,” said Louis XV. “He will be the ruin of
France and of himself, but at any rate I shall not live to see it.”
4</p>
<p>How could this princely workingman be transformed into a king? Could
a stimulating mate be found to give him courage and pride, and to bear
him future Bourbons? The present ruler was too busy with Mme. du Barry

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>attend to this matter; but Choiseul, minister for foreign affairs,
remembered his days at the court of Vienna, and a lively archduchess,
Maria Antonia Josepha, then (1758) three years old; perhaps her marriage
with Louis-Au- guste would give new life to that Austrian alliance which
had been weak- ened by France’s separate peace w ith England (1762).
Prince von Kaunitz had confided similar ideas to Count Florimund Mercy
d’Argentau, a Liege aristocrat of great wealth and good heart, who was
Austrian ambassador at Versailles. Louis XV took their concerted advice,
and sent (1769) a formal request to Maria Theresa asking the hand of
Maria Antonia for Louis-Au- guste. The Empress was happy to sanction a
union which she too had long ago designed. The Dauphin, who had not been
consulted in the matter, obe- diently accepted the choice made for him.
When he was told that his fiancee was a beautiful princess, he said
quietly, “If only she has good qualities.” 5</p>
<p>She was born in Vienna November 2, 1755. She was not a pretty child;
her forehead was too high, her nose was too long and sharp, her teeth
were irregular, her lower lip was too full. But she soon knew that her
blood was royal; she learned to walk like a destined queen, and nature,
with the mys- terious fluids of puberty, refashioned her winsomely
until, with silken blond ha ir, and complexion “of lilies and roses,” 6
and sparkling, playful blue eyes, and a “Grecian neck,” she became, if
not a morsel for a king, at least a dainty for a dauphin. Three of her
five older sisters had been maneuvered by the Empress into cozy berths:
Maria Christina had married Prince Albert of Sax- ony, who became duke
of Saxe-Teschen; Maria Amalia had married Ferdi- nand, duke of Parma;
Maria Carolina had become queen of Naples. Brother Joseph was co-emperor
of the Holy Roman Empire, and brother Leopold was grand duke of Tuscany.
There was nothing left for Maria Antonia but to be- come queen of
France.</p>
<p>As the youngest of Maria Theresa’s surviving children, she had been
some - what neglected. At thirteen she had learned some Italian, but she
could write neither German nor French correctly, she knew almost nothing
of history, and, though Gluck was her teacher, she had made only modest
progress in music. When Louis XV decided to accept her as a
granddaughter he insisted that she be inoculated against smallpox, and
he sent the Abbe Vermond to accelerate her education. Vermond reported
that “her character, her heart</p>
<p>The careworn Empress knew that she was entrusting the fate of the
alli- ance to hands too frail for such a responsibility. For two months
before the contemplated marriage she had Maria Antonia sleep in the same
room with her, so that in the intimacy of their nights she might instill
into her daughter something of the wisdom of life and the art of
royalty. She drew up for her a list of regulations to guide her conduct
in morals and politics. She wrote to Louis XV asking his indulgence for
the shortcomings of the immature bride she was sending to his grandson.
To the Dauphin she addressed a letter warm with a mother’s solicitude
and fears:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>As she has been my delight, so 1 hope she will be your happiness. I
have brought her up for this, because for a long time I have foreseen
that she would share your destiny. I have inspired in her a love for her
duties to you, a tender attachment, and the ability to know and practice
the means of pleasing you…. My daughter will love you, I am sure of it,
because I know her…. Adieu, my dear Dauphin; be happy, make her happy….
I am all bathed in tears…. Your tender mother. 8</p>
<p>On April 19, 1770, in the Church of the Augustines at Vienna, the
radiant, thoughtless girl, aged fourteen, was married by proxy to
Louis-Auguste of France; her brother Ferdinand took the Dauphin’s place.
Two days later a long cavalcade of fifty-seven carriages and 366 horses
led the Dauphine past the Palace of Schonbrunn, and the Em press bade
her a last goodbye. “Be so good to the French,” she whispered, “that
they can say that I have sent them an angel.” 9 The cortege included 1 3
2 persons— ladies in waiting, hairdressers, dressmakers, pages,
chaplains, surgeons, apothecaries, cooks, servants, and thirty-five men
to take care of the horses, which were changed four or five times a day
on the long journey to Paris. In sixteen days the procession reached
Kehl, on the Rhine opposite Strasbourg. On an island in the river Maria
changed her Austrian attire for French garments; her Austrian attend-
ants left her to return to Vienna, and were replaced by an entourage of
French ladies and servants; henceforth Maria Antonia was Marie
Antoinette. After much ceremony she was brought into Strasbourg while
cannon pealed and church bells rang and all the people cheered. She wept
and smiled and went through the long ritual patiently. When the
burgomaster began a speech in German she interrupted him: “Do not speak
German, gentlemen; from today I understand no language but French.”
Having allowed her a day of rest, the pageant began its transit of
France.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that the King and the Dauphin, with much of the
court, should go to Compiegne, fifty-two miles northeast of Paris, to
meet the Dauphine’s cortege. This arrived on May 14. The bride leaped
from her coach, ran to Louis XV, bowed to the ground, and remained so
till the King raised her and put her at her ease wi th a gracious
remark: “You are already a member of the family, madame, for your mother
has the soul of Louis XIV.” 10 After kissing her on both cheeks he
introduced the Dauphin, who did likewise but with perhaps less relish.
On May 1 5 the combined proces- sions started for Versailles. There, on
May 16, 1770, an official marriage confirmed the proxy wedding of a
month before. That night there was a great feast in the new opera house.
The King warned Louis-Auguste that he was eating too much. The Daup hin
replied, “I always sleep better after a good supper.” 11 He did, falling
asleep soon after entering the marriage bed.</p>
<p>He slept with the same readiness on successive nights, and on
successive mornings he rose early to go hunting. Mercy d’Argentau
suggested that the recent rapid growth of Louis-Auguste had retarded his
sexual development, and that there was nothing to do but wait. Maria
Theresa, informed of the situation, wrote to her daughte r: “You are
both so young! As far as your health is concerned it is all for the
best. You will both gain strength.” 12 Some of the Dauphin’s physicians
made matters worse by telling him that exercise</p>
<p>8 4 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>and good meals would stimulate amorous development; on the contrary,
they made him stouter and sleepier. Finally, late in 1770, the Dauphin
tried to consummate the marriage, but failed; the only result was a
disenchanting pain. The Count of Aranda, the Spanish ambassador,
reported to his King: “They say that an impediment under the foreskin
makes the attempt at coi - tus too painful,” or “that the foreskin is so
thick that it cannot expand with the elasticity necessary to an
erection.” 13 Surgeons of fered to remove the difficulty by an operation
akin to circumcision, but the Dauphin refused. 14 He made repeated
attempts, with no effect but to agitate and humiliate him- self and his
wife. This situation continued till 1777. The sense of his marital
deficiency deepened the Dauphin’s feeling of inferiority, and may have
shared in making him so hesitating and diffident a king.</p>
<p>Probably those seven years of marital frustration affected the
character and conduct of Marie Antoinette. She knew that the men and
women of the court made merciless fun of her misfortune, and that most
of France, not knowing the cause, charged her with barrenness. She
consoled herself with trips to the opera or the theater in Paris, and
indulged herself in costly ex- travagance of dress. She rebelled against
frequent mingling with the court, with all its ceremony and protocol;
she preferred intimate friendships with sympathetic souls like the
Princesse de Lamballe. For a long time she refused to speak to Mme. du
Barry, whether through distaste for her morals or through envy that
another woman should be so competently loved and so influential with the
King.</p>
<p>On May 10, 1774, Louis XV died. The courtiers rushed to the
apartments of the Dauphin. They found him and the Dauphine on their
knees weeping and praying. “O God,” the nineteen -year- old youth cried,
“protect us! We are too young to rule!” And to a friend he said, “What a
burden! I have learned nothing. It seems that the universe will fall
upon me.” 15 All day lo ng, through Versailles and Paris, and then as
far in France as the news was car- ried, men, women, and children cried
joyfully, “Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi!” Some hopeful Parisian
inscribed upon a statue of Henry IV the word Resurrexit ; 16 the great
King had risen from the dead to rescue France again from chaos,
corruption, bankruptcy, and defeat.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE GOVERNMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>What was wrong with the government? It was not as despotic as
Prussia’s, not as corrupt as England’s; its bureaucracy and provincial
administration contained some good and many able men. Nevertheless the
Bourbon mon- archy had failed to keep up with the economic and
intellectual development of the people. Revolution came to France sooner
than elsewhere because the middle classes had reached a higher stage of
intelligence than in any other contemporary nation, and the alert and
aroused mind of her citizenry made sharper demands upon the state than
any government of the time had to meet.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>849</p>
<p>Frederick II and Joseph II, devotees of philosophy and absolute
monarchy, had brought into the political management of Prussia and
Austria a degree of order and competence not then present in a France
that loved a Latin laxity and ease. “Confusion and chaos reigned
everywhere.” 17 At Versailles the King’s Council conflicted in
jurisdiction with the departmental ministers, who conflicted with one
another because their functions overlapped, because they competed for
the same public funds, and because no authority was su- perimposed to
bring their policies into accord. The nation was divided in one way (
bailliages or senechaussees) for the judiciary; in another ( generalites
) for finance, in another ( gouvernements ) for the army, in another (
paroisses and provinces) for the Church. In each generalite the
intendant conflicted with the governor and the regional par lenient.
Throughout France the inter- ests of rural producers conflicted with
those of urban consumers, the rich conflicted with the poor, the nobles
with the bourgeoisie, the parlements with the king. A unifying cause and
a commanding will were needed; the cause did not come till 1792, the
will not till 1799.</p>
<p>One of the worst aspects of French life was the law, and yet one of
the best was the judiciary. South France kept Roman law, north France
kept common and feudal law. “Justice,” said de Tocqueville, was
“complicated, costly, and slow” 18 — though this is a universal plaint.
Prisons were filthy, punishments were barbarous; judicial torture was
still allowed in 1774. The judges were irremovable, usually unbribable
and just; Sir Henry Maine thought that the jurists of France, “in all
the qualities of the advocate, the judge, and the legislator, far
excelled their compeers throughout Europe.” 19 They held their office
for life, and were entitled to transmit it to a son. The ablest among
them found their way into the regional parlements, and the most wealthy
and influential were chosen to the Parlement of Paris. By 1774 the
“nobility of the robe”— the hereditary magistrates — had come to
consider itself only slightly below the “nobility of the sword” in
dignity and deserts. It admitted to the parlements only persons born
into one or the other of the two aristocracies.</p>
<p>Montesquieu had argued that “intermediate bodies” between the king
and the people would be useful brakes on autocratic power; he had
specified the landed nobility and the magistracy as two such powers. In
order to serve this braking function the parlements claimed authority to
ratify ( registrer ) or reject any royal decree as in their judgment it
accorded or conflicted with established laws and rights. Several
provincial parlements, especially those of Grenoble, Rouen, and Rennes,
voiced semidemocratic doctrines, some- times with Rousseauian phrases
about “the general will” and “the free con - sent of the nation”; so the
Parlement of Rennes in 1788 proclaimed “that - fenders of class
distinctions and privileges. Their contests with the royal power shared
in preparing the Revolution, but as this approached they sided with the
Old Regime, and fell with its fall.</p>
<p>Theoretically the royal power was absolute. By Bourbon tradition the
kin g</p>
<p>850</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>was the sole legislator, the chief executive, and the supreme court.
He could have any person in France arrested and indefinitely confined
without giving a reason or allowing a trial; even the kindly Louis XVI
sent out such lettres de cachet. The King had inherited a costly
establishment, which considered itself indispensable to the
administration and prestige of the government. In 1774 the court at
Versailles included the royal family and 886 noblemen, with their wives
and children; add 295 cooks, fifty-six hunters, forty-seven musicians,
eight architects, sundry secretaries, chaplains, physicians, couriers,
guards… ; altogether some six thousand persons, with ten thousand
soldiers stationed nearby. Each member of the royal family had his or
her separate court; so did some special nobles, like the Princes de
Conde and de Conti and the Dues d’Orleans and de Bourbon. The King
maintained sev - eral palaces — at Versailles, Marly, La Muette, Meudon,
Choisy, St. -Hubert, St. -Germain, Fontainebleau, Compiegne, and
Rambouillet. It was customary for him to move from palace to palace,
with parts of the court following him and requiring to be housed a nd
fed. The expenses of the King’s table in 1780 ran to 3,660,491 livres.
21</p>
<p>The salaries of court officials were moderate, but the perquisites
were elas - tic; so M. Augeard, a secretary in one of the ministries,
was paid only nine hundred livres a year, but admitted that the post
netted him 200,000 livres annually. A hundred sinecures brought the
courtiers money while subordi- nates did the work; M. Machault received
eighteen thousand livres for sign- ing his name twice a year. 22 A
hundred pensions totaling 28,000,000 livres annually went to persuasive
nobles or their proteges. 23 A hundred intrigues were carried on to
determine who should receive the careless bounty of the King. He was
expected to relieve old titled families fallen into straitened finances,
and to provide dowries for noble daughters on their marriage. Each of
Louis XV’s surviving children received approximately 150,000 livres per
year. Each minister of state was paid up to 150,000 livres as annual
salary, for he was expected to entertain expansively. All this
prodigality, these pensions, gifts, salaries, and sinecures were paid
out of revenues drawn from the economic life of the nation. In sum the
court cost France fifty mil- lion livres a year — a tenth of the total
income of the government. 24</p>

<li>THE VIRGIN QUEEN</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie Antoinette was the most extravagant member of the court. At-
tached to an impotent husband, cheated of romance, indulging in no
liaisons, she amused herself, till 1778, with costly dresses, gems, and
palaces, with operas, plays, and balls. She lost fortunes in gambling,
and gave fortunes to favorites in reckless generosity. She spent 252,000
livres on her wardrobe in one year (1783). 25 Designers brought her
fancy garmen ts named “Indiscreet Pleasures,” “Stifled Signs,” or
“Masked Desires.” 26 Hairdressers worked for hours over her head,
training her hair to such heights that her chin seemed to be the mean
point of her height; this haute coiffure , like almost every-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV ) THE FINAL GLORY 85 1</p>
<p>hing about her, set a fashion for the ladies of the court, then of
Paris, then of the provincial capitals.</p>
<p>Her longing for jewelry became almost a mania. In 1774 she bought
from Bohmer, official jeweler to the Crown, gems valued at 360,000
livres. 27 Louis XVI gave her a set of rubies, diamonds, and bracelets
costing 200,000 livres. 28 In 1 776 Mercy d’Argentau wrote to Maria
Theresa:</p>
<p>Although the King has given the Queen, on various occasions, more
than 100,000 ecus’ worth of diamonds, and although her Majesty already
has a pro - digious collection, she nevertheless resolved to acquire…
chandelier ear- rings from Bohmer. I did not conceal from her Majesty
that under present economic conditions it would have been wiser to avoid
such a tremendous ex- penditure, but she could not resist — although she
handled the purchase care- fully, keeping it a secret from the King.
29</p>
<p>Maria Theresa sent her daughter a stern reproof; the Queen
compromised by wearing her jewelry only on state occasions; but the
public never for- gave her this intemperate expenditure of its taxes,
and later it would believe the story that she had agreed to buy the
famous diamond necklace.</p>
<p>The King indulged his wife in her foibles because he admired and
loved her, and because he was grateful for her patience with his
impotence. He paid her gambling debts out of his own purse. He
encouraged her trips to the Paris opera, though he knew that her gaiety
in public disturbed a people accustomed to royal dignity and reserve.
The government paid for three theatrical performances, two balls, two
formal suppers almost every week at court; in addition the Queen
attended masked balls in Paris or in private homes. These years,
1774-77, were a period of what her mother frankly called dissipation.
Deriving nothing but aroused and unsatisfied passion from her husband’s
nocturnal approaches, the Queen encouraged him to go to sleep early
(sometimes setting the clock ahead to advance his retirement), so that
she could join her friends in games that might last all night. She took
no interest in literature, little in art, more in drama and music; she
sang and acted well, played the harp, and performed some Mozart sonatas
on the clavi- chord. 30</p>
<p>In all these faults only one was fundamental — a thoughtless
extravagance derived from boredom and frustration, and from a childhood
and youth ac- customed to riches and ignorant of poverty. The Prince de
Ligne (who may have been more of a gentleman than an historian) claimed
that she soon outgrew her love of costly raiment, that her gambling
losses were exagger- ated, and that her debts were due as much to unwise
generosity as to reckless expenditure. 31 The court and the salons were
hostile to her as an Austrian; the alliance with Austria had never been
popular; Marie Antoinette, called “L’Autrichienne,” personified that
alliance, and was suspected, with some reason, of favoring Austrian
interests, sometimes at the cost of France. Even so, her youthful
vitality, her gaiety and kindliness, won many hearts. Mme. Vigee-Lebrun,
many months pregnant, came to paint her portrait (1779); while at work
the artist dropped some tubes of color; the Queen at once told her not
to stoop, for “you are too far along,” and herself picked up the</p>
<p>852 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>ubes. 32 Antoinette was usually considerate, but occasionally, in her
thought- less merrim ent, she made fun of other people’s mannerisms or
defects. And she responded too readily to every appeal; “she did not yet
know the dan - ger of yielding to every gracious impulse.” 33</p>
<p>So vivacious a creature, to whom life and movement were synonyms, was
not made for the slow and careful pace of court etiquette. Soon she
rebelled against it, and sought simplicity and ease in and around the
Petit Trianon, a mile from the Palace of Versailles. In 1778 Louis XVI
offered the Queen undisputed possession of this trysting place; there
she might retire with her intimates, and Louis promised that he would
not intrude upon them except by invitation. As there were only eight
rooms in the building, the Queen had some cottages built near it for her
friends. She had the surrounding gar- dens designed in the “natural”
style— with winding paths, varied trees, sur- prises, and a brook, and
for this she had water piped in from Marly at great cost. To complete
the illusion of a Rousseauian return to nature, she had eight small
farms set up in the adjoining park, each with its rustic cottage,
peasant family, dung heap, and cows. There she dressed like a
shepherdess in white gown, gauze kerchief, and straw hat, and loved to
see milk coaxed from choice udders into vessels of Sevres porcelain.
Within the Petit Trianon she and her friends played music or games, and
on the lawn they gave ban- quets to the King or to distinguished
visitors. There, as well as in the royal palace, the Queen staged
dramas, in some of which she played major roles — Suzanne in Le Manage
de Figaro , Colette in Le Devin du village, delighting the King with her
versatility and charm.</p>
<p>Fearing scandal if she mingled too freely with men, she formed with
women some friendships so close that scandal took another line. First
came Marie-Therese de Savoie-Carignan, Princesse de Lamballe, gentle,
sad, and frail. Twenty-one, she was already two years a widow. Her
husband, son of Louis XIV’s grandson the Due de Penthievre, went off to
mistresses or prostitutes soon after his marriage; he contracted
syphilis and died of it after confessing his sins to his wife in
revolting detail. She never recovered from the long ordeal of that
marriage; she suffered from nervous convulsions and fainting spells
until, in 1792, she was torn to pieces by a Revolutionary mob. Marie
Antoinette first took to her out of pity, then learned to love her fer-
vently, seeing her every day, writing to her letters of endearment
sometimes twice a day. In October, 1775, she made the Princess
superintendent of the Queen’s Household, and persuaded the King, over
Turgot’s protests, to pay her a yearly salary of 1 50,000 livres.
Moreover, the Princess had relatives and friends, who begged her to use
her influence with the Queen, and through her with the King, to obtain
posts or gifts. Antoinette, after a year, let her love fade, and took
another friend.</p>
<p>Yolande de Polastron, wife of Comte Jules de Polignac, was of ancient
family and straitened means; pretty, petite, natural; no one would,
seeing her, suspect her of such financial voracity that Turgot despaired
of balanc- ing the budget while the Queen found pleasure in her witty
company. When the Countess neared childbirth the Queen persuaded her to
move to La</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>853</p>
<p>Muette, a royal villa near the Versailles Palace; there she visited
her daily, almost always bearing gifts. When the Comtesse became a
mother nothing could be refused her: 400,000 livres to settle her debts,
a dowry of 800,000 livres for her daughter, an embassy for her father,
money, jewels, furs, works of art for herself, and finally (1780) a
dukedom and the estate of Bitche — for the Count longed to be a duke. At
last Mercy d’Argentau informed the Queen that she was being exploited,
and that the new Duchess did not return her devotion. He proposed, and
the Queen accepted, as a test, that she ask Mme. de Polignac to dismiss
from her entourage the Comte de Vaudreuil, who was distasteful to
Antoinette; Madame refused, and Marie turned to other friendships. The
Polignacs joined her enemies, and became a source of the slanders with
which the court and the pamphleteers besmirched the name of the
Queen.</p>
<p>Almost everything that she did made her enemies. The courtiers
regretted the gifts she gave to her favorites, since this meant less for
themselves. They complained that she so often absented herself from
court functions that these lost glamour and attendance. Many who had
condemned the costly wardrobe of her earlier years now censured her for
setting a new fashion of simplicity in dress; the silk merchants of
Lyons and the couturiers of Paris would be ruined. 34 She had induced
the King to dismiss the Due d’Aiguillon (1775), who had led the
supporters of Mme. du Barry; the Duke had many sympathizers, and these
formed another nucleus of foes. After 1776 the Paris pamphleteers — many
of whom received material and money from members of the court 35 —
engaged in a campaign of merciless vituperation against the Queen. 36
Some writers described her as the mistress, at one time or another, of
every available male at Versailles. 37 “How many times,” asked a
pamphlet entitled A Reprimand to the Queen , “have you left the nuptial
bed and the caresses of your husband to abandon yourself to bacchantes
or satyrs, and to become one with them through their brutal pleasures?”
38 Another pamphlet illustrated her extravagance by describing a wall in
the Petit Trianon as cov- ered with diamonds. 39 Rumor accused her of
saying, during the bread riots of 1788, “If they have no bread let them
eat cake”; historians agree that she was never guilty of that heartless
remark; 40 on the contrary, she contributed abundantly from her own
purse to public relief. Even more cruel was the general opinion, among
the populace, that she was barren. Mme. Campan, first lady of the
bedchamber to the Queen, relates:</p>
<p>When in 1777 a son was born to the Comte d’Artois, the market women
and fishwives, asserting their prerogative to enter the royal palace at
times of royal births, followed the Queen to the very door of her
apartments, shouting in the coarsest and most vulgar terms that it was
up to her, not to her sister-in- law, to provide heirs to the French
crown. The Queen hurried to close the door upon these licentious
harridans, and closeted herself in her room with me to weep over her
plight. 41</p>
<p>How could she explain to the people that the King was impotent?</p>
<p>France waited for the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to come and
clear this impasse. In April, 1777, Joseph II arrived at Versailles
under the</p>
<p>854</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>pseudonym of Count von Falkenstein. He fell in love with the Queen.
“If you were not my sister,” he told her, “I should not hesitate to
marry again in order to have such a charming companion.” 42 And to their
brother Leo - pold he wrote:</p>
<p>I have spent hour after hour with her, and not noticed their
passing…. She is a charming and honorable woman, somewhat young, a
little thoughtless, but essentially decent and virtuous…. She also has
spirit and a keenness which surprised me. Her first reaction is always
correct; if she would only act according to it,… and pay less attention
to the gossips,… she would be perfect. She has a strong desire for
pleasure, and since her tastes are known, advantage is taken of her
weakness….</p>
<p>But she thinks only of her own pleasure, has no love for the King,
and is drunk with the extravagance of this country…. She drives the King
by force to the things he does not wish to do…. In short, she does not
fulfill the duties of either a wife or a queen. 43</p>
<p>She explained why she and the King slept in separate rooms; he wished
to go to sleep early, and they both found it wise to avoid sexual
excitement. Joseph visited the King, and liked him well. “This man,” he
wrote to Leo - pold, “is a little weak, but not an imbecile. He has
ideas and a sound judg - ment, but his mind and body are apathetic. He
converses reasonably, but he has no wish to learn, and no curiosity;… in
fact the fiat lux has not yet come; the matter is still without form.”
44 The Emperor talked to Louis as no one had dared speak to him; he
pointed out that the impediment in the royal prepuce could be removed by
a simple, though painful, operation, and that the King owed it to his
country to have children. Louis promised to submit to the knife.</p>
<p>Before leaving Versailles Joseph wrote a sheet of “Instructions” for
the Queen. It is a remarkable document:</p>
<p>You are getting older, and no longer have youth as an excuse. What
will become of you if you delay any longer [to reform]?… When the King
caresses you, when he speaks to you, do you not show irritation, even
re- pugnance? Have you ever thought what effect your intimacies and
friendships… must have on the public?… Have you weighed the terrible
conse- quences of games of chance, the company they bring together and
the tone they set?…</p>
<p>And of her fondness for the masked balls in Paris:</p>
<p>Why mingle with a crowd of libertines, prostitutes, and strangers,
listening to their remarks, and perhaps making similar ones? How
indecent!… The King is left alone all night at Versailles, and you mix
in society and mingle with the riffraff of Paris!… I really tremble for
your happiness, for it can- not turn out well in the long run, and there
will be a cruel revolution [une revolution cruelle ] unless you take
steps against it. 45</p>
<p>The Queen was moved by his reproaches. After he had gone she wrote to
her mother: “The Emperor’s departure has left a gap I cannot fill. I was
so happy during that short time that now it all seems like a dream. But
what will never be a dream for me is all the good counsel… he gave me,
which is engraved in my heart forever.” 46 What really reformed her was
not advice</p>

<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>855</p>
<p>but motherhood. For Louis, in that summer of 1777, submitted,
apparently without anesthetic of any kind, to an operation which proved
completely successful. He celebrated his twenty-third birthday (August
23, 1777) by at last consummating his marriage. He was proud and happy.
“I very much enjoy this pleasure,” he confided to one of his maiden
aunts, “and I am sorry to have been deprived of it for so long.” 47
However, it was not till April, 1778, that the Queen became pregnant.
She announced this to the King in her frolicsome way: “Sire, I have come
to complain that one of your subjects has been so bold as to kick me in
the belly.” 48 When Louis caught her meaning he clasped her in his arms.
Now more than ever he indulged her whims and granted her requests. Ten
times a day he visited her apart- ments for the latest communique on the
progress of the expected heir. And Marie Antoinette, undergoing a
mysterious transformation of body and soul, told the King, “Henceforth I
want to live otherwise than before. I want to live as a mother, nurse my
own child, and devote myself to its edu- cation.” 49</p>
<p>After grievous suffering, made worse by a clumsy accoucheur, the
Queen gave birth, December 19, 1778. The parents regretted that the
child was a girl, but the King was happy that the gates of life had been
opened, and con- fident that a son would come forth in time. The young
mother rejoiced that at last she had been fulfilled. To Maria Theresa
(now entering her final year) she wrote in 1779: “Dear Mamma may be very
satisfied as to my con - duct. If I was formerly to blame, it was
because I was childish and giddy. Now, however, I am much more sensible,
and I am very well aware what my duty is.” 50 Neither the court nor the
populace believed it, but “it is an accepted fact,” wrote the Comte de
Segur, “that after the birth of her first child she gradually began to
lead a more regular existence, and to occupy herself seriously. She is
more careful to avoid anything that might give rise to scandal. Her gay
parties are less frequent, less lively…. Extravagance gives place to
simplicity; sumptuous robes are replaced by little linen frocks.” 51 It
was part of Marie Antoinette’s long punishment that the people of France
would not realize that the spoiled and reckless girl had become a tender
and conscientious mother. Nothing is lost, but everything has to be paid
for.</p>
<p>She knew that French law excluded women from the throne. She wel-
comed a second pregnancy, and prayed for a son; but she suffered a mis-
carriage so agonizing that she lost most of her hair. 52 She tried
again, and on October 22, 1781, she gave birth to a boy, who was named
Louis- Joseph- Xavier. Cynics questioned the child’s paternity, but the
happy King ignored them. “My son the Dauphin!” he cried. “My son!”</p>

<p>Except in age Louis was everything that his wife was not. She was
grace- ful, agile, mobile, playful, impulsive, effervescent, frivolous,
extravagant,</p>
<p>856</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>self-assertive, proud, always a queen; he was clumsy, inert,
hesitant, serious, quiet, industrious, thrifty, modest, diffident, every
inch not a king. He loved the day, his work, and the hunt; she loved the
night, the card table, and the dance. And yet, after those early
tentative years, it was not an unhappy marriage; the Queen was faithful,
the King was fond, and when grief came it made them firmly one.</p>
<p>His features were regular; he might have been handsome if he had con-
trolled his weight. He was tall, and might have been royal had he not
walked with swinging shoulders and heavy tread. His eyesight was poor,
which con- tributed to his awkwardness. His hair was seldom in order;
“his person was greatly neglected,” report ed Mme. Campan. 54 He was
muscular and strong; he lifted one of his pages with one arm. He ate
avidly. He drank moderately, but sometimes became drunk with food, and
had to be helped to his bed. 55 He had few passions, few ecstasies of
pleasure, few extremes of pain.</p>
<p>He was ill at ease with the Frenchmen who surrounded him, and who
were trained in alertness of mind and witty readiness of speech;
however, in private converse, he impressed men like Joseph II with his
wide knowl- edge and sane judgment. Hear Prince Henry of Prussia,
brother to Frederick the Great:</p>
<p>The King surprised me…. I had been told that his education had been
neglected, that he knew nothing, had little spirit. I was astonished, in
talking with him, to see that he knew geography very well, that he had
sound ideas in politics, that the happiness of his people was always in
his thoughts, and that he was full of good sense, which is worth more in
a prince than a brilliant intellect; but he distrusted himself too much.
56</p>
<p>Louis had a good library, and used it. He read and in part translated
Gib- bon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , 57 but he put it aside
when he perceived its anti- Christian tendency. He read and reread
Clarendon’s His - tory of the Rebellion, as if in premonition that he
would repeat the fate of Charles I. “Had I been in his place,” he said,
“I should never have drawn the sword against my people.” 58 For the
guidance of La Perouse’s Pacific expe - dition (1785) he composed
detailed instructions which his ministers ascribed to the savants of the
Academie des Sciences. 59 He kept in close touch with the various
ministries, especially on foreign affairs. Washington and Frank- lin
admired his judgment. 60 His weaknesses were rather of will than of
mind, and may have been allied to his heaviness of diet and flesh. Basic
was his in- capacity to resist persuasion, or to conclude from
reflection to action. He himself practiced economy, but he was too
amiable to force it upon others, and he signed away hundreds of
thousands of francs at the behest of his wife.</p>
<p>He had no lack of virtues. He took no mistress, and he was faithful
in friendship, perhaps except with Turgot. “It is quite probable that,
nex t to Turgot, he is the man of his day who loved the people most.” 61
On the day of his accession he bade the Controller General of Finance
distribute 200,000 francs among the poor, and he added, “If, considering
the needs of the state,</p>

<p>857</p>
<p>collection of the “coronation tax” which made the beginning of a
reign a new burden for the nation. In 1784, when Paris was suffering
from inunda- tions and epidemics, he allotted three million francs for
public aid. During a severe winter he allowed the poor, day after day,
to invade his kitchen and help themselves. He was a Christian in title,
in fact, and in observance; he followed all the ritual and regulations
of the Church scrupulously; and though he loved food, he kept all the
fasts of Lent. He was religious without fanaticism or display; it was
he, orthodox and pious, who gave civil rights to the Protestants of
France. He tried to reconcile Christianity with govern- ment, which is
the most difficult thing in the world.</p>
<p>Despite his love of simplicity he had to live externally like a king:
to go through the formal levee, let himself be dressed by pages and
courtiers, recite his morning prayers in their presence, give audience,
preside in council, issue edicts, attend dinners, receptions, balls —
though he did not dance. But so far as his position and appetite
allowed, he lived like any good citizen. He agreed with Rousseau that
every man should learn a manual craft; he learned sev- eral, from
lockmaking to masonry. Mme. Campan tells us that “he admitted into his
private apartment a common locksmith, with whom he made keys and locks;
and his hands, blackened by that sort of work, were often, in my
presence, the subject of remonstrances, and even sharp reproaches, from
the Queen.” 63 He was fascinated by all that concerned construction; he
helped the palace workingmen to move materials, girders, paving blocks.
He liked to make repairs in his apartment with his own hands; he was a
good middle- class husband. One of his rooms contained geographical
paraphernalia, globes, maps — some of which he had drawn himself;
another held instruments for working in wood; another was equipped with
a forge, anvils, and a great variety of iron tools. He labored for
months to manufacture a giant clock that would record months, phases of
the moon, seasons, and years. Several rooms were occupied by his
library.</p>
<p>France loved him, even to his death and beyond, for it was Paris, not
France, that guillotined him in 1793. In those early years the acclaim
was almost universal. “You have a very good king,” wrote Frederick the
Great to d’Alembert, “and I congratulate you with all my heart. A king
who is wise and virtuous is more to be feared by his rivals than a
prince who has only courage.” And d’Alembert replied: “He loves
goodness, justice, econ - omy, and peace…. He is just what we ought to
desire as our king, if a propitious fate had not given him to us.” 64
Voltaire concurred: “All that Louis has done since his accession has
endeared him to France.” 65 Goethe in old age recalled the auspicious
beginning:</p>
<p>In France a new and benevolent sovereign evinced the best intentions
of devoting himself to the removal of so many abuses, and to the noblest
ends — of introducing a regular and efficient system of political
economy, of dispensing with all arbitrary power, and of ruling by law
and justice alone. The brightest hopes spread over the world, and
confident youth promised itself and to all mankind a bright and noble
future. 66</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>V. THE MINISTRY OF TURGOT: 1 774-76</p>
<p>The first task of Louis XVI was to find capable and upright ministers
who would repair the chaos in administration and finance. The people
were clamoring for the recall of the banished parlements; he recalled
them, and dismissed Maupeou, who had tried to replace them. For his
chief minister he brought back to Versailles Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux,
Comte de Maurepas, who had been minister of state from 1738 to 1749, had
been deposed for lampooning Mme. de Pompadour, and now returned to power
at the age of seventy-three. It was a benevolent but unfortunate choice,
for Maurepas, living for a decade on his rural estate, had lost touch
with the development of France in economy and thought, and had more wit
than wisdom. For for- eign affairs the twenty-year-old King chose
Charles Gravier, Comte de Ver- gennes; for the war ministry Comte
Claude-Louis de Saint-Germain; and for minister of marine Anne-Robert-
Jacques Turgot, Baron de l’Aulne.</p>
<p>We have in previous pages seen him as a seminarian, a lecturer on
Chris- tianity and progress, a friend of physiocrats and philosophes ,
an enterprising and beneficent intendant in Limoges. The devots at the
court warned Louis that Turgot was an unbeliever, who had contributed
articles to the Encyclo- pedic ? 1 nevertheless, on August 24, 1774, the
King advanced him to the most critical post in the government —
controller general of finance. Turgot’s place at the navy was taken by
Gabriel de Sartine, who spent prodigally in building the fleets that
were to help free America, and who relied on Turgot to find the
funds.</p>
<p>Turgot was such a Frenchman as Louis XIV had had in Colbert,
dedicated to the service of his country, farseeing in his views,
tireless, incorruptible. He was tall and handsome, but he lacked the
graces of men polished in the salons — though he was welcomed ardently
by Mile, de Lespinasse. His health had been sacrificed to his work; much
of the time when he was labor- ing to remake the French economy he was
confined to his rooms with gout. He tried to compress a quarter century
of reforms into one brief ministry because he felt that his tenure of
office was precarious. He was forty-seven when he came to power,
forty-nine when he lost it, fifty-four when he died.</p>
<p>He believed with the physiocrats that industry and trade should be
left as free as possible from regulation by government or guilds; that
land was the only source of wealth; that a single tax on land was the
fairest and most practical way of raising revenue; and that all indirect
taxes should be abol- ished. From the philosophes he took their
religious skepticism and toleration, their trust in reason and progress,
their hope for reform through an enlight- ened king. If the monarch was
a man of intelligence and good will, and would accept philosophy as his
guide, this would be a peaceful revolution, far better than a violent
and chaotic uprising which might destroy not only old abuses but social
order itself. Now this these royale of Voltaire was to be put to the
test. So the philosophes joined with the physiocrats in rejoicing over
Turgot’s rise to power.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>859</p>
<p>At Compiegne on August 24, 1774, Turgot went to thank Louis XVI for
appointment to the Ministry of Finance. “I give myself not to the king,”
he said, “but to the honest man.” Louis, taking Turgot’s hands in his
own, re - plied, “You shall not be deceived.” 68 That evening the
minister sent to the King a letter stating the essentials of his
program:</p>
<p>No bankruptcy, either avowed or disguised….</p>
<p>No increase in taxes, the reason for this lying in the condition of
your people….</p>
<p>No loans,… because every loan necessitates, at the end of a given
time, either bankruptcy or the increase of taxes….</p>
<p>To meet these three points there is but one means. It is to reduce
expenditure below revenue, and sufficiently below it to insure each year
a saving of twenty millions, to be applied to the redemption of the old
debts. Without that, the first gunshot will force the state into
bankruptcy. 69</p>
<p>(Necker later resorted to loans, and the war of 1778 led France to
bank- ruptcy.)</p>
<p>After noting that the annual revenue of the government was
213,500,000 francs, and the annual expenditure 235,000,000 francs,
Turgot ordered vari- ous economies, and issued instructions that no
payment should be made from the treasury, for any purpose, without his
knowledge and consent. He sought to stimulate the economy by
establishing, step by step, freedom of enterprise, production, and
trade. He began with an attempt to restore agri- culture. Usually, to
avoid discontent in the cities, the government had con- trolled the
trade in grain, regulating its sale by the farmer to the wholesaler and
by the wholesaler to the retailer, and limiting the price of bread. But
low prices to the peasant discouraged him from growing more grain, and
deterred others from farming; vast cultivable areas of France lay
unsown, and the potential wealth of the nation was being checked at its
source. The restoration of agriculture seemed to Turgot the first step
in reviving France. Freedom of the farmer to sell his grain at whatever
price he could get would raise his income, status, and purchasing power,
and lift him out of the primi- tive and bestial life that La Bruyere had
described in the heyday of Louis XIV. 70</p>
<p>So, on September 13, 1774, Turgot issued through the Royal Council an
edict freeing the grain trade everywhere except in Paris, where the
urban reaction would be critical. Du Pont de Nemours had written for the
edict a preamble explaining its purpose: “To animate and extend the
cultivation of the land, whose produce is the most real and certain
wealth of the state; to maintain abundance by granaries and the entry of
foreign grain;… and to remove monopoly… in favor of full competition.”
Such an explana - tory preface was itself an innovation, reflecting the
rise of public opinion as a political power. Voltaire hailed the edict
as the beginning of a new eco- nomic era, and predicted that it would
soon raise the nation’s prosperity. 71 He sent a note to Turgot: “The
old invalid of Ferney thanks nature for having made him live long enough
to see the decree of September 13, 1774. He presents his respects to the
author, and prays for his success.” 72</p>
<p>86o</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>There was an ominous exception to the applause. In the spring of 1775
Jacques Necker, a Swiss banker living in Paris, came to Turgot with a
manu- script Sur la Legislation et le commerce des grains , and asked if
it might be published without detriment to the government. Necker’s
pamphlet argued that some measure of governmental control over the
economy was neces- sary if the superior cleverness of the few was not to
concentrate wealth at one end and intensify poverty at the other. He
proposed that if free trade should raise the price of bread beyond a
stated figure the government should resume regulation. Turgot, confident
in his theories, and favoring freedom of the press, told Necker to
publish and let the people judge. 73 Necker pub- lished.</p>
<p>The city populace did not read him, but it agreed with him. As the
price of bread rose in the spring of 1775, riots broke out in several
cities. In the districts around Paris, controlling the flow of grain
into the capital, men went from town to town, rousing the people to
revolt. Armed bands burned down the granges of farmers and merchants and
threw the stored grain into the Seine; they tried to prevent imported
grain from proceeding from Le Havre to Paris; and on May 2 they led a
crowd to the gates of the palace at Versailles. Turgot believed that
these bands were employed by the municipal or provincial officials who
had lost their posts through the end of regulation, and who aimed to
create in Paris a scarcity of grain that would raise the price of bread
and compel a return to controlled trade. 74 The King appeared on a
balcony and tried to speak; the noise of the crowd drowned out his
words. He forbade his troops to fire upon the people, and ordered a
reduc- tion in the price of bread.</p>
<p>Turgot protested that this interference with the laws of supply and
de- mand would ruin the attempt to test them; he was confident that, if
they were left free to operate, the competition among merchants and
bakers would soon bring down the price of bread. The King rescinded his
order for reducing the price. On May 3 angry crowds gathered in Paris
and began to pillage the bakeries. Turgot ordered the Paris militia to
protect the bakeries and granaries, and to fire upon any person who
offered violence. Meanwhile he saw to it that foreign grain reached
Paris and the markets. Monopolists who had held their grain in
expectation of high prices were compelled, by this imported competition,
to release their stores; the price of bread fell, and the rebellion
subsided. Several of its leaders were arrested; two were hanged by order
o f the police. Turgot emerged victorious from this “Guerre des Fa -
rines,” but the King’s faith in laissez -faire had been shaken, and he
mourned those two hangings in the Place de Greve.</p>
<p>He was pleased, however, with the reforms that Turgot was effecting
in the finances of the government. Only a day after the grain edict the
hurried minister began to issue ordinances for economy in state
expenditures, for the more efficient collection of taxes, and stricter
control of the farmers general; for transferring to the state the
hitherto private monopolies in diligences, post carriages, and the
manufacture of gunpowder. He proposed, but had no time to establish, a
“Caisse d’Escompte,” a bank to discount commercial</p>

<p>86</p>
<p>paper, receive deposits, make loans, and issue notes payable on
presentation; this bank served as a model for the Bank of France
organized by Napoleon in 1800. By the end of 1775 Turgot had reduced
expenses by 66,000,000 livres, and had lowered the interest on the
national debt from 8,700,000 to 3,000,000 livres. The credit of the
government was so restored that he was able to borrow 60,000,000 livres
from Dutch financiers at four per cent, and so discharge debts on which
the treasury had been paying from seven to twelve per cent. He came
close to balancing the budget, and he did this not by raising taxes but
by lessening corruption, extravagance, incompetence, and waste.</p>
<p>In these and other reforms he received little aid from Maurepas, but
much from Chretien de Malesherbes, whom we have met as protector of the
Ency- clopedic and Rousseau. Now president of the Cours des Aides (which
dealt with indirect taxes), he sent to Louis XVI (May 6, 1775) a memoir
— Re- montrance — explaining the injustices involved in the collection
of taxes by the farmers general, and warning the King of the hatred
generated by their operation. He advised a simplification and
clarification of the laws; “there are no good laws,” he said, “except
simple laws.” The King grew fond of Malesherbes, and made him minister
of the King’s Household (July, 1775). The aging liberal urged Louis to
support Turgot, but advised Turgot not to attempt too many reforms at
once, for each reform would arouse new foes. The Controller General
answered, “What would you have me do? The needs of the people are
enormous, and in my family we die of gout at fifty.” 75</p>
<p>In January, 1776, Turgot startled France with six edicts issued in
the name of the King. One extended to Paris the freedom of trade in
grain, and ended a multitude of offices connected with that trade; the
functionaries so dislodged joined his enemies. Two of the edicts
canceled or modified the taxes on cattle and tallow; the peasants
rejoiced. Another abolished the cor- vee — the twelve or fifteen days of
unpaid labor exacted from peasants yearly to maintain bridges, canals,
and roads; henceforth this work was to be paid for by a tax upon all
non-ecclesiastical property; the peasants rejoiced, the nobles
complained. Turgot aroused further resentment by the preamble that he
placed in the mouth of the King:</p>
<p>With the exception of a small number of provinces,… nearly all the
roads of the kingdom have been built by the unpaid labor of the poorest
part of our subjects. The whole burden has therefore fallen on those who
have nothing but their hands and are interested only in a very secondary
degree in the roads; those really interested are the landowners, almost
all of them privileged per- sons, the value of whose property is
increased by the roads. When the poor man alone is forced to maintain
these roads, when he is forced to give his time and his work without
pay, the only resource he has against misery and hunger is taken from
him to make him work for the profit of the rich. 76</p>
<p>When the Paris Parlement indicated that it would refuse to register
this edict, Turgot almost proclaimed class war:</p>
<p>862</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>While as unfriendly to despotism as ever, I shall say constantly to
the King, to the Parlement, and, if necessary, to the whole nation, that
this is one of those matters that must be decided by the absolute will
of the King, and for this reason: at bottom this is a lawsuit between
the rich and the poor. Now, of what is the Parlement made up? Of men
wealthy as compared with the masses, and all noble, since their offices
carry nobility. The court, whose clamor is so powerful — of what is it
composed? Of great lords, the majority of whom own estates that will be
subject to the tax…. Consequently neither the remonstrance of the
Parlement… nor even the clamor of the court should in any wise prejudice
the case…. So long as the people shall have no voice in the parlement s
the King, after hearing these, must judge for himself, and he must judge
in favor of the people, for this class is the most unhappy. 77</p>
<p>The last of the six edicts abolished the guilds. These had become an
aris- tocracy of labor, for they controlled nearly all the crafts, they
limited ad- mission by requiring high entrance fees, and they still
further restricted eligibility to mastership. They obstructed invention,
and hampered trade by tolls or embargoes on competitive products
entering their commune. The rising class of entrepreneurs — men who
supplied initiative, capital, and organ- ization, but demanded liberty
to hire any worker, whether guildsman or not, and to sell their wares in
any market they could reach — denounced the guilds as monopolies in
restraint of trade; and Turgot, anxious to promote industrial
development by freeing invention, enterprise, and commerce, felt that
the national economy would benefit by the suppression of the guilds. The
preamble of this edict read, in part:</p>
<p>In almost all towns the exercise of the different arts and trades was
centered in the hands of a small number of masters united in guilds, who
alone had the freedom to manufacture and sell the articles of the
particular industry of which they had the exclusive privilege. He who
devoted himself to any part or trade could not exercise it freely until
after attaining the mastership, to which he could be admitted only by
submitting to long, tedious, and superfluous tasks, and at the cost of
multiplied exactions depriving him of a part of the capital requisite
for establishing a business or for fitting up a workshop. Those who
could not afford these expenses were reduced to a precarious existence
under the sway of the masters, with no choice but to live in penury,… or
to carry to some foreign land an industry that might have been useful to
their country. 78</p>
<p>So far as we know, these charges against the guilds were justified.
But Turgot went on to prohibit all masters, journeymen, and apprentices
from forming any union or association. 79 He believed completely in
freedom of enterprise and trade, and did not foresee that the right of
organization might be the only means by which the workers could pool
their individual weak- ness into a collective strength capable of
bargaining with organized em- ployers. He felt that in the long run all
classes would benefit by the libera- tion of the businessman from
feudal, guild, and governmental restraints on enterprise. All persons in
France — even foreigners — were declared free to en- gage in any
industry or trade.</p>
<p>On February 9, 1776, the six edicts were submitted to the Paris
Parle- ment. It agreed to only one, which abolished certain minor
offices; it refused</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV )</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>863</p>
<p>o approve or register the rest, and it especially opposed, as an
infringement of feudal rights, 80 the ending of the corvee. By this vote
the Parlement, which had professed to protect the people against the
king, declared itself the ally and voice of the nobility. Voltaire
entered the lists with a pamphlet attacking the corvee and the Parlement
and supporting Turgot; Parlement ordered the pamphlet suppressed. Some
of the King’s ministers defended the Parlement; Louis, in a moment of
fortitude, rebuked them, saying, “I see well that there is no one here
but Monsieur Turgot and myself who love the people.” 81 On March 1 2 he
summoned the Parlement to a “bed of justice” at Versailles, and ordered
it to register the edicts. Parades of workingmen celebrated Turgot’s
victory.</p>
<p>Exhausted by repeated crises, the Controller General slowed his
revolu- tion. When he extended freedom of internal trade to the wine
industry (April, 1776) only the monopolists complained. He urged the
King to es- tablish religious liberty. He instructed Du Pont de Nemours
to draw up a plan for electoral assemblies in each parish, chosen by men
who owned land to the value of six hundred livres or more; these local
assemblies would elect representatives to a cantonal assembly, which
would elect representatives to a provincial assembly, which would elect
deputies to a national assembly. Believing that France was not ready for
democracy, Turgot proposed to give these assemblies only advisory and
administrative functions; legislative power would remain solely in the
king; but through these assemblies the ruler would be informed of the
condition and needs of the realm. Turgot also offered the King a sketch
of universal education as the necessary prelude to an enlightened
citizenship. “Sire,” he said, “I venture to assert that in two years
your nation will no longer be recognizable, and through enlighten- ment
and good morals… it will rise above all other states.” 82 The minis -
ter had no time, the King had no money, to bring these ideas to
fulfillment.</p>
<p>Turgot’s edicts— and their preambles — had inflamed all the
influential classes against him except the merchants and manufacturers,
who flourished in the new freedom. Actually he was attempting to bring
about peaceably that emancipation of the businessman which was the basic
economic result of the Revolution. Yet some merchants secretly opposed
him because he had interfered with their monopolies. The nobility
opposed him because he wished to put all taxes upon the land, and was
setting the poor against the rich. The Parlement hated him for
persuading the King to override its vetoes. The clergy distrusted him as
an unbeliever who rarely went to Mass and was advocating religious
liberty. The farmers general fought him because he wished to replace
them with governmental agents in collecting indirect taxes. Financiers
resented his getting loans from abroad at four per cent. Courtiers
disliked him because he frowned upon their extravagance, their pensions,
and their sinecures. Maurepas, his superior in the ministry, looked with
no pleasure upon the growing power and independence of the Con- troller
General of Finance. “Turgot,” wrote the Swedish ambassador, “finds
himself the butt of a most formidable coalition.” 83</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette had at first favored Turgot, and had tried to adjust
her</p>
<p>86 4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>expenditures to his economies. But soon she resumed (till 1777) her
extrava- gances in gowns and gifts. Turgot did not conceal his dismay at
her drafts upon the treasury. To please the Polignacs the Queen had
secured the ap- pointment of their friend the Comte de Guines to the
French embassy in London; there he engaged in questionable financial
dealings; Turgot joined Vergennes in advising the King to recall him;
the Queen vowed revenge. Louis XVI had his own reasons for losing
confidence in his revolutionary minister. The King respected the Church,
the nobility, even the parlements; these institutions had been mortised
in tradition and sanctified by time; to disturb them was to loosen the
foundations of the state; but Turgot had alienated them all. Could
Turgot be right and all the others wrong? Louis secretly complained
about his minister: “Only his friends have merit, and only his own ideas
are good.” 84 Almost daily the Queen or a courtier sought to influence
him against the Controller. When Turgot appealed to him to resist these
pressures and Louis made no answer, Turgot returned to his home and
wrote to the King (April 30, 1776) a letter that sealed his own
fate:</p>
<p>Sire:</p>
<p>I will not conceal from you the fact that my heart is deeply wounded
by your Majesty’s silence last Sunday…. So long as I could hope to
retain your Majesty’s esteem by doing right, nothing was too hard for
me. Today what is my recompense? Your Majesty sees how impossible it is
for me to make head against those who injure me by the evil they do me,
and by the good they keep me from doing by thwarting all my measures;
yet your Majesty gives me neither aid nor consolation…. I venture to
say, Sire, that I have not de- served this….</p>
<p>Your Majesty… has pleaded the lack of experience. I know that at the
age of twenty-two, and in your position, you have not the training in
the judging of men which private individuals obtain from habitual
association with equals; but will you have more experience in a week, in
a month? And is your mind not to be made up until this slow experience
has come?…</p>
<p>Sire, I owe to M. Maurepas the place your Majesty has given me; never
shall I forget it, never shall I be wanting in due deference to him….
But, Sire, do you know how weak is the character of M. de Maurepas? —
how much he is governed by the ideas of those around him? Everyone knows
that Mme. de Maurepas, who has infinitely less mind but much more
character, constantly inspires his will…. It is this weakness that moves
him to fall in so readily with the clamor of the court against me, and
that deprives me of almost all power in my department….</p>
<p>Forget not, Sire, that it was weakness that brought to the block the
head of Charles I,… that made Louis XIII a crowned slave,… and that
brought about all the misfortunes of the last reign. Sire, you are
deemed weak, and upon occasion I have feared lest your character had
this defect; nevertheless I have seen you, upon other more difficult
occasions, exhibit genuine courage…. Your Majesty cannot, without being
untrue to yourself, yield out of complaisance for M. de Maurepas… ,
85</p>
<p>To this letter the King made no reply. He felt that now he had to
choose between Maurepas and Turgot, and that Turgot was asking almost
complete submission of the government to his own will. On May 12,1 776,
he sent Tur- got an order to resign. On the same day, yielding to the
Queen and the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>865</p>
<p>Polignacs, he made the Comte de Guines a duke. Malesherbes, hearing
of Turgot’s removal, handed in his own resignation. “You are a fortunate
man,” Louis told him; “would that I too could leave my post.” 86 Soon
most of Tur - got’s appointees were discharged. Maria Theresa was
shocked by these devel - opments, and agreed with Frederick and Voltaire
that the fall of Turgot presaged the collapse of France; 87 she deplored
the part that her daughter had played in the matter, and would not
believe the Queen’s disclaimer of respon - sibility. Voltaire wrote to
Laharpe: “Nothing is left for me but to die, now that M. Turgot has
gone.” 88</p>
<p>After his dismissal Turgot lived quietly in Paris, studying
mathematics, physics, chemistry, and anatomy. He often saw Franklin, and
wrote for him a Memoir e sur I’impot. His gout became so severe that
after 1778 he walked only with crutches. He died on March 18, 1781,
after years of pain and dis- appointment. He could not foresee that the
nineteenth century would accept and implement most of his ideas.
Malesherbes summed him up lovingly: “He had the head of Francis Bacon
and the heart of L’Hopital.” 89</p>
<ol start="6" type="i">
<li>necker’s first ministry: 1776 -81</li>
</ol>
<p>Turgot was succeeded as controller of finances by Clugny de Nuis, who
re-established the corvee and many guilds, and did not enforce the grain
edicts. The Dutch bankers canceled their agreement to lend France sixty
million livres at four per cent; and the new minister discovered no
better way of luring money into the treasury than by establishing a
national lot- tery (June 30, 1776). When Clugny died (October), the
bankers of Paris persuaded the King to call to his service the man who
had been the ablest critic of Turgot.</p>
<p>Jacques Necker was a Protestant, born at Geneva in 1732. His father,
professor of law in the Geneva Academy, sent him to Paris to work as a
clerk in the bank of Isaac Vernet. When Vernet retired he advanced some
funds to Necker to start a bank of his own. Necker pooled his resources
with an- other Swiss; they prospered through loans to the government and
specula- tion in grains. At the age of thirty-two Necker was rich,
dignified, and unmarried. His desire now was not for more wealth but for
high place, a chance for distinguished service and national renown. For
this he needed a wife and a home as a point d’appui, or base of
operations. He courted the widowed Marquise de Vermenoux; she refused
him, but brought from Geneva the pretty and talented Suzanne Curchod,
who had recently escaped marriage with Edward Gibbon. Necker fell in
love with Suzanne, and married her in 1764. Their mutual devotion
through an eventful life is one of the bright colors in the kaleidoscope
of that troubled age. They made a home over his bank, and there she
opened a salon (1765) to which she in- vited writers and men of affairs,
hoping that these friendships would smooth and illuminate her husband’s
way.</p>
<p>Necker himself itched to write. He began in 1773 with an tiloge de
Col-</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>bert, which was crowned by the French Academy. Now he retired from
business, and entered the political fray with that essay Sur la
Legislation des grains which countered Turgot’s policy of laissez
-faire. The little book won praise from Diderot, who may have relished a
paragraph in which the banker (who had read Rousseau) spoke like a
socialist. Necker assailed</p>
<p>he power of the owning class, in exchange for labor, to pay the
lowest pos- sible wage, that which merely suffices for strict
necessaries…. Almost all civil institutions have been made by property
owners. One might say that a small number of men, having divided the
earth among themselves, made laws as a union and guarantee against the
multitude…. The latter could say: “Of what import to us are your laws of
property? — we have no property; or your laws of justice? — we have
nothing to defend; or of liberty? — if we do not work tomprrow we shall
die !” 90</p>
<p>On October 22, 1776, on Maurepas’ recommendation, Louis XVI ap -
pointed Necker “director of the Royal Treasury.” It was an apologetic
appellation. Some prelates protested against letting a Swiss Protestant
rule the nation’s money; Maurepas replied, “If the clergy will pay the
debts of the state they can share in choosing the ministers.” 91 To
cover the reality a French Catholic, Taboureau de Reau, was made
controller general of finance as formally Necker’s superior. Cleri cal
opposition subsided as Necker made his piety conspicuous. On June 29,
1777, Taboureau resigned, and Necker was named director general of
finance. He refused any salary; on the con- trary, he lent to the
treasury two million livres of his own. 92 He was still denied the title
of minister, and was not admitted to the Royal Council.</p>
<p>He did well within the limits of his character and his power. He had
been trained to deal with problems of banking rather than of state; he
could multiply money more successfully than he could manage men. In the
finan- cial administration he established better order, accountability,
and economy; he abolished over five hundred sinecures and superfluous
posts. Having the confidence of the financial community, he was able to
float loans that brought to the treasury 148,000,000 livres within a
year. He promoted some minor reforms, reducing inequities in taxation,
improving hospitals, and or- ganizing pawnshops to lend money to the
poor at low interest. He continued Turgot’s endeavors to check the
expenditures of the court, the King’s household, and the Queen. The
collection of indirect taxes was restored to the farmers general (1780),
but Necker reduced their number, and sub- jected them to sharper
scrutiny and control. He prevailed upon Louis XVI to allow the
establishment of provincial assemblies in Berry, Grenoble, and
Montauban, and he set an important precedent by arranging that in these
gatherings the representatives of the Third Estate (the middle and lower
classes) should equal those of the nobility and the clergy combined. The
King, however, chose the members of these assemblies, and allowed them
no legislative authority. Necker won a substantial victory by inducing
the King to free all remaining serfs on the royal domain, and to invite
all feudal lords to do likewise. When they refused, Necker advised Louis
to abolish all serfdom in France, with indemnities to the masters, but
the King, im-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>THE FINAL GLORY</p>
<p>867</p>
<p>prisoned in his traditions, replied that property rights were too
basic an in- stitution to be annulled by a decree. 93 In 1780, again on
Necker’s prompting, he ordered an end to judicial torture, the disuse of
subterranean prisons, and the separation of prisoners duly convicted of
crimes from those not yet tried, and both of these groups from those
arrested for debt. These and other achievements of Necker’s first
ministry deserve more acknowledgment than they have generally received.
If we ask why he did not cut deeper and faster, we should remember that
Turgot had been censured for going too fast and making too many
simultaneous enemies. Necker was criticized for floating loans instead
of raising taxes, but he felt that the people had been taxed enough.</p>
<p>Mme. Campan, always close to the developing drama, summarized well
the attitude of the King to his ministers: “Turgot, Malesherbes, and
Necker judged that this prince, modest and simple in his habits, would
willingly sacrifice the royal prerogative to the solid greatness of his
people. His heart disposed him to reform, but his prejudices and fears,
and the clamor of pious and privileged persons, intimidated him, and
made him abandon plans which his love for the people had suggested.” 94
Yet he dared to say, in a public proclamation (1780) probably prepared
by Necker, that “the taxes of the poorest part of our subjects” had
“increased in proportion much more than all the rest,” and he expressed
his “hopes that rich people will not think themselves wronged when, put
back to the general level [of taxation], they will have to meet the
charges which long since they should have shared more equally with
others.” 95 He shuddered at the thought of Voltaire, but his liberal
spirit, unwittingly, had been formed by the work that Voltaire, Rous-
seau, and the philosophes in general had done to expose old abuses and
to stir to new life the humanitarian sentiments formerly associated with
Christian- ity. In this first half of his reign Louis XVI began reforms
which, if con- tinued and gradually expanded, might have averted
revolution. And it was under this weak king that France, despoiled and
humiliated by England under his predecessors, struck boldly and with
success at proud Britain, and, in the process, helped to free
America.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>FRANCE AND AMERICA</li>
</ol>
<p>Philosophy for once agreed with diplomacy: the writings of Voltaire,
Rousseau, Diderot, Raynal, and a hundred others had prepared the French
mind to support colonial as well as intellectual liberation, and many
Ameri- can leaders — Washington, Franklin, Jefferson — were sons of the
French Enlightenment. So, when Silas Deane came to France (March, 1776)
to seek a loan for the rebellious colonies, public opinion was strongly
sympathetic. The ebullient Beaumarchais sent memoir after memoir to V
ergennes, urging him to help America.</p>
<p>Vergennes was a nobleman who believed in monarchy and aristocracy,
and was no friend of republics or revolutions; but he longed to
avenge</p>
<p>868</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>France against England. He would not sanction any open aid to
America, for the British navy was still stronger than the French despite
Sartine’s out - lays, and in open war it could soon destroy French
shipping. But he advised the King to permit some secret aid. If (he
argued) Britain crushed the revolt, it would have, in or near America, a
fleet capable of taking at will the French and Spanish possessions in
the Caribbean. If the revolt could be prolonged, France would be
strengthened, England would be weakened, and the French navy could
complete its renewal. Louis trembled at the thought of helping a
revolution, and he warned Vergennes against any overt act that might
lead to war with England. 96</p>
<p>In April Vergennes wrote to Beaumarchais:</p>
<p>We will secretly give you one million livres. We will try to obtain
an equal sum from Spain. [This was obtained.] With these two millions
you will estab- lish a commercial firm, and at your risk and peril you
will supply the Ameri- cans with arms, munitions, equipment, and all
other things that they will need to maintain the war. Our arsenal will
deliver to you arms and munitions, but you will either replace them or
pay for them. You will not demand money from the Americans, since they
have none, but you will ask in return the produce of their soil, which
we will help you sell in this country. 97</p>
<p>With this money Beaumarchais bought cannon, muskets, gunpowder,
cloth- ing, and equipment for 25,000 men; these stores he sent to a port
where Deane had assembled and refitted several American privateers. The
arrival or assurance of this aid encouraged the colonists to issue their
Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776). Translated into French, and
circulated with the tacit consent of the French government, this
pronouncement was greeted with enthusiasm an d joy by the philo sophes ,
and by Rousseau’s disciples, who recognized in it some echoes of the
Contrat social. In September the American Congress appointed Benjamin
Franklin and Arthur Lee to proceed as commissioners to France, join
Deane, and seek not only more supplies, but, if possible, open
alliance.</p>
<p>It was by no means Franklin’s first appearance in Europe. In 1724,
not yet nineteen, he went to England; he worked as a printer, published
a defense of atheism, 98 returned to Philadelphia and deism, married,
joined the Free- masons, and won international renown as inventor and
scientist. In 1757 he was sent to England to represent the Pennsylvania
Assembly in a tax dispute. He stayed in England five years, met Johnson
and other notables, visited Scotland, met Hume and Robertson, received a
degree from the University of St. Andrews, and was henceforth
Dr. Franklin. He was again in England from 1766 to 1775, addressed the
House of Commons in opposition to the Stamp Tax, attempted conciliation,
and went back to America when he saw that war was imminent. He shared in
drafting the Declaration of Independ- ence.</p>
<p>He reached France in December, 1776, bringing two grandchildren with
him. He was now seventy years old, and looked like wisdom itself; all
the world knows that massive head, the sparse white hair, the face like
the full moon at its beaming rise. The scientists covered him with
honors, the phi-</p>

<p>losophers and the physiocrats claimed him as their own, the admirers
of an- cient Rome saw in him Cincinnatus, Scipio Africanus, and both
Catos, all reborn. The ladies of Paris dressed their hair in a curly
mass to imitate his beaver cap; doubtless they had heard of his many
amours. The courtiers were startled by his simplicity of manners, dress,
and speech; but instead of his seeming ridiculous in his almost rustic
garb, it was their own display of velvet, silk, and lace that appeared
now as a vain attempt to cover reality with show. Yet they too accepted
him, for he paraded no utopias, talked with reason and good sense, and
showed full awareness of the difficulties and the facts. He realized
that he was a Protestant, a deist, and a republican seeking help from a
Catholic country and a pious King.</p>
<p>He went about his task cautiously. He offended no one, delighted
every- one. He paid his respects not only to Vergennes but to Mirabeau
pere and Mme. du Deffand; his bald head shone at the salons and at the
Academie des Sciences. A young noble, the Due de La Rochefoucauld, was
proud to be his secretary. Crowds ran after him when he appeared in the
streets. His books, translated and published as Oeuvres completes , had
a wide welcome; one volume, La Science du bonhomme Richard ( Poor
Richard’s Almanac ), went through eight editions in three years.
Franklin attended the Neuf Soeurs Lodge of the Freemasons, and was made
an honorary member; the men he met there helped him to win France to an
alliance with America. But he could not ask at once for open support
from the government. Wash- ington’s army was in retreat before Sir
William Howe, and its morale seemed shattered. While waiting for more
propitious events Franklin settled down in Passy, a pleasant suburb of
Paris, and studied, negotiated, wrote propaganda under pseudonyms,
entertained Turgot, Lavoisier, Morellet, and Cabanis, and flirted with
Mme. d’Houdetot at Sannois and Mme. Hel- vetius at Auteuil; for these
women had a charm that made them agelessly attractive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Beaumarchais and others were sending supplies to the
colonies, and French army officers were enlisting for service under
Washington. Silas Deane wrote in 1776: “lam well -nigh harassed to death
with applications of officers to go out to America…. Had I ten ships
here I could fill them all with passengers for America.” 99 All the
world knows how the Marquis de Lafayette, nineteen years old, left a
devoted and pregnant wife to go (April, 1777) and serve without pay in
the colonial army. He confessed to Washington, “The one thing for which
I thirst is glory.” 100 In that quest he faced many dangers and
humiliations, was wounded at Brandywine, shared the hardships of Valley
Forge, and earned warm affection from the usually reserved
Washington.</p>
<p>On October 17, 1777, a force of five thousand British soldiers and
three thousand German mercenaries, coming down from Canada, was over-
whelmed at Saratoga by a colonial army of twenty thousand men, and sur-
rendered. When news of this American victory reached France the plea of
Franklin, Deane, and Lee for an alliance found more acceptance among the
King’s advisers. Necker opposed it, unwilling to see his almost
balanced</p>

<p>budget upset by the expenses of a war. Vergennes and Maurepas won
reluc- tant consent from Louis XVI by warning him that England — long
since aware and resentful of French aid to America — might make peace
with her colonies and turn her full military force against France. On
February 6, 1778, the French government signed two treaties with “the
United States of Amer - ica”: one established relations of trade and
assistance, the other secretly stipulated that if England should declare
war upon France the signatories would join in defense; neither would
make peace without the other’s consent, and both would continue to fight
England until American independence had been won.</p>
<p>On March 20 Louis received the American envoys; Franklin put on silk
stockings for this occasion. In April John Adams arrived to replace
Deane; he lived with Franklin at Passy, but found the old philosopher so
occupied with women that little time was left for official business. He
quarreled with Franklin, tried to have him recalled, failed, and
returned to America. Frank- lin was made minister plenipotentiary to
France (September, 1779). In 1780, aged seventy-four, he proposed, in
vain, to Mme. Helvetius, aged sixty-one.</p>
<p>The war was popular with almost every Frenchman except Necker. He had
to raise the great sums that France lent to America: a million livres in
1776, three million more in 1778, another million in 1779, four in 1780,
four in 1781, six in 1782. 101 He entered into private negotiations with
Lord North (December 1, 1779) in the hope of finding a formula of peace.
102 In addition to these loans he had to raise money to finance the
French government, army, navy, and court. Altogether he borrowed, from
bankers and the pub- lic, 530,000,000 livres. 108 He coaxed the clergy
into lending fourteen million, repayable in installments of a million
livres a year. He still refused to raise taxes, though the prosperity of
the upper classes might have made this com- paratively painless; his
successors were to complain that he left to them this unavoidable
necessity. The financiers favored him because he allowed them, on their
loans, the high interest rates which they demanded on the ground that
they were running increasing risks of never being repaid.</p>
<p>To foster confidence in the financial community, Necker, with the
King’s consent, published in January, 1781, a Compte rendu au Roi, which
pur- ported to inform the King and the nation of the government’s
revenues and expenses. It brightened the picture by excluding military
outlays and other “extraordinary” charges, and ignoring th e national
debt. The Compte rendu was bought by the public at the rate of thirty
thousand copies in twelve months. Necker was acclaimed as a wizard of
finance who had saved the government from bankruptcy. Catherine the
Great asked Grimm to assure Necker of her “infinite admiration for his
book and for his talents.” 104 But the court was angry that the Account
Rendered to the King had exposed so many fiscal abuses of the past, and
so many pensions that went out from the treasury. Some attacked the
document as merely a eulogy of the minis- ter by himself. Maurepas
became as jealous of Necker as he had been of Turgot, and joined several
others in recommending his dismissal. The Queen, though she had been
vexed by Necker’s economies, defended him,</p>

<p>but Vergennes called him a revolutionist, 105 and the intendants, who
feared that Necker planned to undermine them by establishing more
provincial assemblies, joined in the cry and hunt. Necker contrived his
own fall by de- claring that he would resign unless given the full title
and authority of a minister, with a seat on the Conseil du Roi. Maurepas
told the King that if this were done all the other ministers would
abandon their posts. Louis yielded, and let Necker go (May 19, 1781).
All Paris except the court mourned his fall. Joseph II sent condolences;
Catherine invited him to come and direct the finances of Russia. 106</p>
<p>On October 12, 1779, Spain joined France against England, and the
com- bined French and Spanish fleets, 140 ships of the line, now almost
equaled the 1 50 vessels of the British navy, 107 and interrupted
Britannia’s rule of the</p>
<p>England asked for terms. Shelburne sent separate missions to the
French government and to the American envoys in France, hoping to play
one ally against the other. Vergennes had already (1781) meditated peace
with Eng- land on the basis of partitioning most of North America among
England, France, and Spain. 108 He entered into an understanding with
Spain to keep the Mississippi Valley under European control. 109 In
November, 1782, he proposed to support the English in their endeavor to
exclude the American states from the Newfoundland fisheries. 110 These
negotiations were quite in line with diplomatic precedents, but the
American envoys, learning of them, felt warranted in operating with
similar secrecy. Vergennes and Franklin agreed that each ally might deal
separately with England, but that neither should sign any treaty of
peace without the other’s consent. 111</p>
<p>The American negotiators — chiefly John Jay and Franklin — played the
diplomatic game brilliantly. They won for the United States not only
inde- pendence but also access to the Newfoundland fisheries, half of
the Great Lakes, and all the vast and rich area between the Alleghenies
and the Mississippi; these were far better terms than the American
Congress had expected to obtain. On November 30, 1782, Jay, Franklin,
and Adams signed a preliminary treaty with England. Formally this
violated the agree- ment with V ergennes, but it stipulated that it was
not to have validity until England had made peace with France. Vergennes
complained, then accepted the situation. On September 3, 1783, the
definitive treaty was signed — “in</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>he name of the most Holy and undivided Trinity” 112 — between England
and America at Paris, between England, France, and Spain at Versailles.
Franklin remained in France as United States ambassador till 1785. When
he died in Philadelphia, April 17, 1790, the French Constituent Assembly
wore mourning for three days.</p>
<p>The French government was made bankrupt by the war, and that bank-
ruptcy led to the Revolution. Altogether France had spent a billion
livres on the conflict, and the interest on the national debt was
dragging the treas- ury down day by day toward insolvency. Nevertheless
that debt was an affair between the government and the rich; it hardly
affected the people, many of whom had prospered from the stimulation of
industry. The monarchy was critically injured, but not the nation;
otherwise how could history ex- plain the success with which the economy
and the armies of Revolutionary France withstood half of Europe from 1
792 to 1815?</p>
<p>Certainly the spirit of France was uplifted. Statesmen saw in the
peace of 1783 a triumphant resurrection from the debasement of 1763. The
philo- sophies hailed the result as a victory for their views; and
indeed, said de Tocqueville, “The Americans seemed to have executed what
our writers had conceived.” 113 Many Frenchmen saw in the a chievement
of the colonies an inspiring presage of democracy spreading through
Europe. Democratic ideas infected even the aristocracy and the
parlements. The Declaration of Rights issued by the Virginia
constitutional convention on June 12, 177 6, and the Bill of Rights
added to the American Constitution, became part models for the
Declaration of the Rights of Man promulgated by the French Constituent
Assembly on August 26, 1789.</p>
<p>It was the final glory, the culminating chivalry, of feudal France
that it died in helping to establish democracy in America. It is true
that most French statesmen thought in terms of revitalizing France. But
the enthusiasm of nobles like Lafayette and Rochambeau was real; they
risked their lives time and again in servin g the newborn state. “I was
far from being the only one,” wrote the young Comte de Segur, “whose
heart palpitated at the sound of the awakening of liberty, struggling to
shake off the yoke of arbitrary power.” 114 The famous surrender of
feudal rights b y the aristocrats in the Constituent Assembly (August 4,
1789) was here prefigured and prepared. It was a brave hara-kiri. France
gave money and blood to America, and re- ceived in return a new and
powerful impulse to freedom.</p>
