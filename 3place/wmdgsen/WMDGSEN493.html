<h4 id="chapter-xxiv">CHAPTER XXIV</h4>
<p>Henry VIII and Thomas More</p>
<p>1529-35</p>
<p>I. THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT</p>
<p>I N the Parliament that assembled at Westminster on November 3, 1529,
the controlling groups — the nobles in the Upper House, the merchants in
the Commons — agreed on three policies: the reduction of ecclesiastical
wealth and power, the maintenance of trade with Flanders, and support of
the King in his campaign for a male heir. This did not carry with it
approval of Anne Boleyn, who was generally condemned as an adventuress,
nor did it prevent an almost universal sympathy with Catherine. 1 The
lower classes, politically impotent, were as yet unfavorable to the
divorce, and the northern provinces, intensely Catholic, sided
wholeheartedly with the Pope. 2 Henry kept this oppisition temporarily
quiet by remaining orthodox in everything but the right of the popes to
govern the English Church. On that point the national spirit, even
stronger in England than in Germany, upheld the hand of the King; and
the clergy, though horrified at the thought of making Henry their
master, were not averse to independence from a papacy so ob- viously
subject to a foreign power.</p>
<p>About 1528 one Simon Fish published a six-page pamphlet which Henry
read without known protest, and many read with frank delight. It was
called “The Supplication of the Beggars,” and asked the King to
confiscate, in whole or part, the wealth of the English Church:</p>
<p>In the times of your noble predecessors past, 〔there〕 craftily
crept</p>
<p>into your realm . . . holy and idle beggars and vagabonds . . .
bishops, abbots, deacons, archdeacons, suffragans, priests, monks,
canons,</p>
<p>friars, pardoners, and summoners. And who is able to number this</p>
<p>idle, ruinous sort, which (setting all labor aside) have begged
so</p>
<p>importunately that they have gotten into their hands more than a</p>
<p>third part of all your Realm? The goodliest lordships, manors, lands,
and territories are theirs. Besides this, they had the tenth part of all
corn, meadow, pasture, grass, wool, colts, calves, lambs, pigs, geese,
and chickens. . . . Yea, and they look so narrowly upon their
profits</p>
<p>that the poor wives must be countable to them of every tenth egg, or
else she getteth not her rights at Easter. . . . Who is she that will
set</p>
<p>543</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>( CHAP . XXIV</p>
<p>her hand to work to get 3d. a day, and may have at least 2od. a day
to sleep an hour with a friar, a monk, or a priest? 8</p>
<p>The nobles and merchants might have admitted some exaggeration in the
indictment, but they thought it led to a charming conclusion — the
seculariza- tion of Church property. “These lords,” wrote the French
ambassador Jean du Bellay, “intend … to impeach . . . the Church and
take all its goods; which it is hardly needful for me to write in
cipher, for they proclaim it openly. . . . I expect the priests will
never have the Great Seal”— i.e., never head the gov- ernment — “again,
and that in this Parliament they will have terrible alarms.” 4 Wolsey
had held off this attack on Church property, but his fall left the
clergy powerless except through the (declining) faith of the people; and
the papal authority that might have protected them by its prestige, its
interdicts, or its allies, was now the main object of royal wrath, and
the football of Im- perial politics. Custom required that legislation
affecting the Church in England should be passed, or require
confirmation, by the Convocation of the clergy under the archbishops of
Canterbury and York. Could this assem- bly assuage the anger of the King
and check the anticlericalism of Parlia- ment?</p>
<p>The battle was opened by the Commons. It drew up an address to the
King, professing doctrinal orthodoxy, but strongly criticizing the
clergy. This famous “Act of Accusation” charged that Convocation made
laws without the consent of King or Parliament, seriously limiting the
liberty of laymen, and subjecting them to heavy censures or fines; that
the clergy exacted payment for the administration of the sacraments;
that the bishops gave benefices to “certain young folks, calling them
their nephews,” and despite the youth or ignorance of such appointees;
that the episcopal courts greedily exploited their right to levy fees
and fines; that these courts arrested persons, and imprisoned them,
without stating the charges against them; that they indicted and
severely punished laymen upon suspicion of the slightest heresy; and the
document concluded by begging the King for the “reforma - tion” of t
hese ills. 5 Henry, who may have been privy to the composition of this
address, submitted its main points to the Convocation, and asked for an
answer. The bishops admitted some abuses, which they attributed to occa-
sional individuals; they affirmed the justice of their courts; and they
looked to the pious King, who had so nobly rebuked Luther, to aid them
in suppress- ing heresy. Then, grievously mistaking the royal temper,
they added warlike words:</p>
<p>Forasmuch as we repute and take our authority of making the laws</p>
<p>to be grounded upon the Scriptures of God and the determination</p>
<p>of Holy Church . . . we may not submit the execution of our
charges</p>
<p>and duty, certainly prescribed to us by God, to your Highness’ as
-</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE</p>
<p>sent. . . . With all humility we therefore beseech your Grace …
to</p>
<p>maintain and defend such laws and ordinances as we … by the</p>
<p>authority of God, shall for His honor make to the edification of
virtue and the ma intaining of Christ’s faith.®</p>
<p>The issue was joined. Henry did not meet it at once. His first
interest was to get Parliament’s approval for a strange request— that he
be excused from repaying the loans that had been made to him by his
subjects.* The Com- mons protested and consented. Three other bills were
introduced, which aimed to check the authority of the clergy over the
probate of wills, their exaction of death taxes, and their holding of
plural benefices. These bills were passed by the Commons; they were
passionately opposed by the bishops and abbots sitting in the Upper
House; they were amended, but in essence they were made law. Parliament
adjourned on December 17.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1 530 the King received some costly
encouragement. Thomas Cranmer, a doctor of divinity at Cambridge,
suggested to Henry that the major universities of Europe should be
polled on the question whether a pope could permit a man to marry his
brother’s widow. A merry game of rival bribery ensued: Henry’s agen ts
scattered money to induce negative judgments; Charles’s agents used
money or threats to secure af - firmative replies. 7 The Italian answers
were divided; the Lutheran univer- sities refused any comfort to the
Defender of the Faith; but the University of Paris, under pressure by
Francis, 8 gave the answer so doubly dear to the King. Oxford and
Cambridge, after receiving stem letters from the govern- ment, approved
Henry’s rig ht to have his marriage annulled.</p>
<p>So strengthened, he issued through his attorney general (December
1530) a notice that the government intended to prosecute, as violators
of the Praemunire Statute, all clergymen who had recognized Wolsey’s
legatine power. When Parliament and Convocation reassembled (January 16,
1531), the King’s agents happily announced to the clergy that the
prosecution would be withdrawn if they would confess their guilt and pay
a fine of £ ii 8,000 ($ 1 1, 800, 000?). 9 They protested that they had
never wanted Wolsey to have such power, and had recognized him as legate
only because the King had done so in the trial of his suit before Wolsey
and Campeggio. They were quite right, of course, but Henry sorely needed
money. They mournfully agreed to raise the sum from their congregations.
Feeling his oats, the King now demanded that the clergy should
acknowledge him as “the protector and only supreme head of the Church
and clergy of Eng - land”— i.e., that they should end their allegiance
to the Pope. They offered a dozen compromises, tried a dozen ambiguous
phrases; Henry was merciless, and insisted on Yes or No. Finally

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>546</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>ham, now eighty- one, reluctantly proposed the King’s formula, with a
sav - ing clause — “so far as the law of Christ permits.” The
Convocation remained silent; the silence was taken as consent; the
formula became law. Mollified, the King now allowed the bishops to
prosecute heretics.</p>
<p>Parliament and Convocation adjourned again (March 30, 1531). In July
Henry left Catherine at Windsor, never to see her again. Soon thereafter
she was removed to Ampthill, while Princess Mary was lodged at Richmond.
The jewels that Catherine had worn as Queen were required of her by
Henry, who gave them to Anne Boleyn. 10 Charles V protested to Clement,
who addressed a brief to the King (January 25, 1532) rebuking him for
adultery, and exhorting him to dismiss Anne and keep Catherine as his
law- ful queen until decision should be given on his application for
annulment. Henry ignored the rebuke, and pursued his romance. About this
time he wrote one of his tender missives to Anne:</p>
<p>Myne awne Sweetheart, this shall be to advertise you of the great</p>
<p>ellingness 〔loneliness〕 that I find here since your departing; for,
I</p>
<p>ensure you, me thinketh the Tyme longer since your departing now</p>
<p>last than I was wont to do a whole Fortnight; I think your
Kindness</p>
<p>and my Fervence of love causeth it. . . . But now that I am
coming</p>
<p>toward you, me thinketh my Pains by half released … in wishing my</p>
<p>self (especially an evening) in my Sweethearts Armes whose pretty</p>
<p>Duckys 〔breasts〕 I trust shortly to kysse. Writne with the Hand
of</p>
<p>him that was, is, and shall be yours by his will, H.R . 11</p>
<p>When Parliament and Convocation reconvened (January 15, 1532) Henry
secured from all four houses further anticlerical legislation: that
clerics under the degree of subdeacon, when charged with felony, should
be tried by civil courts; that fees and fines in ecclesiastical courts
should be reduced; that ecclesiastical death dues and probate fees
should be lowered or abolished; that the annates (the first year’s
revenues of a newly appointed prelate)</p>
<p>By this time a majority of the bishops had been won over to the view
that they would not lose in authority or revenue if the English Church
were independent of Rome. In March 1532, the Convocation announced its
readi- ness to separate from the papacy: “May it please your Grace to
cause the said unjust exactions to cease. . . . And in case the Pope
will make process against this realm for the attaining these annates . .
. may it please your Highness to ordain in the present Parliament that
the obedience of your Highness and of the people be withdrawn from the
Se e of Rome.” 12 And on</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE 547</p>
<p>May 15 the Convocation presented to the King a pledge to submit all
its subsequent legislation to a committee — half laymen, half clergymen
— em- powered to veto any ordinances which it should judge injurious to
the realm. So, in this epochal “Reformation Parliament” and Convocation
the Church of England was bom, and became an arm and subject of the
state.</p>
<p>On May 1 6 Thomas More, having failed to stem the anticlerical tide,
resigned as chancellor, and retired to his home. In August Archbishop
War- ham died, after dictating a deathbed repudiation of the
Convocation’s sub - mission to the King. Henry replaced More with Thomas
Audley, and Warham with Thomas Cranmer. The revolution proceeded. In
February 1533, Parliament enacted a “Statute of Appeals,” by which all
litigation that had formerly been sent for judgment to Rome was
henceforth to be decided “in the spiritual and temporal courts withi n
the Realm, without regard to any . . . foreign . . . inhibition,
excommunication, or interdict.” 18</p>
<p>On January 15,1533, Henry married Anne, who was already four months
pregnant. 14 The King had now urgent reasons for the annulment of his
union with Catherine. Having made, without result, another appeal to the
Pope, he secured from Convocation an approval of his “divorce”
(April</p>
<p>1533); on May 23 Cranmer, as Archbishop of Canterbury, declared the
mar- riage with Catherine unlawful and void; and on May 2 8 he
pronounced Anne to be Henry’s lawful wife. Three days later Anne, in
brocade and jewels, rode to her coronation as Queen of England in a
stately pageant designed by tradition and Hans Holbein the Younger. Amid
the exaltation she no- ticed the disapproving silence of the crowd, and
she may have wondered how long her uneasy head would wear the crown.
Pope Clement pronounced the new marriage null, and its future offspring
illegitimate, and excommuni- cated the King (July rr, 1533). On
September 7 Elizabeth was born.</p>
<p>Charles’s ambassador reported to him that the King’s mistress had
given birth to a bastard. 15</p>
<p>Parliament, which had adjourned on May 4, resumed its sittings on
Janu- ary 15, 1534. Annates and other papal revenues were now definitely
ap- propriated to the Crown, and the appointment of bishops became in
law, as already in practice, a prerogative of the King. Indictments for
heresy were removed from clerical to civil jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In 1533 Elizabeth Barton, a nun of Kent, announced that she had
received orders from God to condemn the King’s remarriage, and had been
allowed to see the place that was being prepared for Henry in hell. The
royal court put her through a severe examination, and drew from her a
confession that her divine revelations were impostures, and that she had
permitted others tt use them in a conspiracy to overthrow the King. 16
She and six “accomplices ’ were tried by the House of Lords, were judged
guilty, and were executed (May 5, 1534). Bishop Fisher’Was accused of
having known of the conspir-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>acy and of having failed to warn the government; it was also charged
that he and Catherine had been privy to a plan, conceived by Chapuys and
dis- couraged by Charles, for an invasion of England to coincide with an
in- surrection of Catherine’s supporters. 17 Fisher denied the charges,
but remained under suspicion of treason.</p>
<p>Henry’s most aggressive agent in these affairs was Thomas Cromwell.
Bom in 1485, the son of a Putney blacksmith, he grew up in poverty and
hardship, and wandered for years, as practically a vagabond, through
France and Italy. Back in England, he entered the textile business,
became a money- lender, and made a fortune. He served Wolsey faithfully
for five years, defended him in adversity, and earned Henry’s respect
for his industry and loyalty. He was made successively chancellor of the
exchequer, master of the rolls, and (May 1534), secretary to the King.
From 1531 to 1540 he was the chief administrator of the government as an
obedient executor of the royal will. His aristocratic enemies, who
despised him as a parvenu symbol of their rising rivals, the
businessmen, accused him of practicing the principles of Machiave lli’s
Prince, of accepting bribes, of selling offices, of inordinately loving
wealth and power. His aim, which he hardly sought to disguise, was to
make the King supreme over every phase of English life, and to finance
an absolute monarchy with the confiscated wealth of the Church. In
pursuing his purposes he showed consummate and unscrupulous ability,
multiplied his fortune, and won every battle except the last.</p>
<p>It was probably at his suggestion and through his manipulation that
Henry, disturbed by increasing hostility among the people, persuaded
Parliament to pass an Act of Succession (March 30, 1534) which declared
the marriage with Catherine invalid, transformed Mary into a bastard,
named Elizabeth heiress to the throne unless Anne should have a son, and
made it a capital crime for any person to question the validity of
Anne’s marriage to Henry, or the legitimacy of their offspring. All
Englishmen and women were by the Act required to take an oath of loyalty
to the King. Royal commissioners, supported by soldiery, rode through
the country, entered homes, castles, monasteries, and convents, and
exacted the oath. Only a few refused it; among these were Bishop Fisher
and Thomas More. They offered to swear to the succession, but not to the
other contents of the Act. They were com- mitted to the Tower. Finally
the Parliament voted the decisive Statute of Supremacy (November 11,
1534); this reaffirmed the King’s sovereignty over Church and state in
England, christened the new national Church Ecclesia Anglicana, and gave
the King all those powers over morals, organi- zation, heresy, creed,
and ecclesiastical reform which had heretofore be- longed to the Church.
The Act made it treason to speak or write of the King as a usurper,
tyrant, schismatic, heretic, or infidel. A new oath was required of all
bishops, that they would accept the civil and ecclesiastical
suoremacy</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE 549</p>
<p>of the King without the reservation “So far as the law of Christ
allows,” and would never in the future consent to any resumption of
papal authority in England.</p>
<p>All the forces of the government were deployed to paralyze the
opposition to these unprecedented decrees. The secular clergy generally
pretended to submit. Many monks and friars, owning a direct allegiance
to the Pope, shied away from the oaths, and their resistance shared in
the King’s later decision to close the monastries. Henry and Cromwell
were especially in- censed by the obstinacy of the friars in the
Charterhouse, a Carthusian mon- astery in London. Three Carthusian
priors came to Cromwell to explain their reluctance to acknowledge any
layman as head of the Church in Eng- land; Cromwell sent them to the
Tower. On April 26, 1535, they, with an- other friar and a secular
priest, were tried by the King’s judges, who were for pardoning them;
but Cromwell, fearing that lenience would encourage wider resistance,
demanded a verdict of guilty, and the judges yielded. On May 3 all five
men, still refusing to accept the Act of Supremacy, were dragged on
hurdles to Tyburn, and one after another was hanged, cut down alive,
disemboweled, and dismembered. 18 One severed arm was hung over the
entrance arch of the Charterhouse to instruct the remaining friars, but
none withdrew his refusal. Three were put in the Tower; they were
fastened to uprights by irons around their necks and feet, and were
forced to stand in that position for seventeen days, fed, but never
loosed for any natural need. The remaining Carthusians, still obdurate,
were dispersed among other monasteries, with the exception of ten who
were imprisoned in Newgate; nine of these died of “prison fever and
filth.” 19</p>
<p>Henry was now the sole judge of what, in religion and politics, the
Eng- lish people were to believe. Since his theology was still Catholic
in every respect except the papal power, he made it a principle to
persecute impar- tially Protestant critics of Catholic dogma, and
Catholic critics of his ec- clesiastical supremacy. Indeed, the
prosecution of heresy had continued, and would continue, all through his
reign. In 153 1, by order of Chancellor More, Thomas Bilney was burned
for speaking against religious images, pilgrimages, and prayers for the
dead. James Bainham was arrested for hold- ing that Christ was only
spiritually present in the Eucharist; he was tortured to draw from him
the names of other heretics; he held fast, and was burned at Smithfield
in April 1532. Two others were burned in that year, and the Bishop of
Lincoln offered an indulgence of forty days to good Christians who would
carry a faggot to feed the fire. 20</p>
<p>This reign of terror reached its apex in the prosecution of Fisher
and More. Erasmus had described the Bishop of Ro chester as “a person
loaded with every virtue.” 21 But Fisher had himself been guilty of
persecution, and he had joined the Spanish ambassador in urging Charles
to invade England</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>550</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>and depose Henry. 22 In law he had committed treason to the state,
which could not excuse him on the plea that he had been loyal to the
Church. The new pontiff, Paul III, made the mistake of naming the
imprisoned Bishop a cardinal. Though Fisher declared that he had not
sought the honor, Henry interpreted the appointment as a challenge. On
June 17, 1535, the Bishop, now in his eightieth year, was given a final
trial, and again refused to sign the oath acknowledging Henry as head of
the English Church. On June 22 he was led to a block on Tower Hill; “a
long, lean body,” an eyewitness described him, “nothing in a manner but
skin and bones, so that the most part that there saw him marveled to see
any man, bearing life, to be so far consumed.” 28 On the scaffold he
received an offer of pardon if he would take the oath; he refused. His
severed head was hung upon London Bridge; it might now, if it could,
said Henry, go to Rome and get its cardinal’s hat. 24</p>
<p>But a more troublesome recusant remained.</p>

<p>The father of Thomas More was a successful lawyer and prominent
judge. Thomas received his education at St. Anthony’s School in London;
was farmed out as a page to Archbishop Morton, and was by him confirmed
in orthodoxy, integrity, and a cheerful piety. Morton predicted, we are
told, that “this child here waiting at table . . . will prove a
marvelous man.” 2 ® At fifteen the youth went to Oxford, and was soon so
fascinated with classical literature that his father, to save the youth
from becoming an impecunious scholar, pulled him out of the university
and sent him to study law in Lon- don. Oxford and Cambridge still aimed
at preparing students for an ec- clesiastical career; New Inn and
Lincoln’s Inn trained the men who were now taking over from the clergy
the government of England. Only eight members of the House of Commons in
the Reform Parliament of 1529-37 had received a university education,
while a rising proportion were lawyers and businessmen.</p>
<p>In 1499, aged twenty-one, More met Erasmus, and was charmed into
humanism. Their friendship is one of the fragrant essences of the time.
They were both given to a measured merriment, and salted their studies
with laugh- ing satire. They shared a distaste for Scholastic
philosophy, whose subtleties, said More, were as profitable as milking a
he-goat into a sieve. 28 They both hoped for a reform of the Church from
within, avoiding a violent disruption of religious unity and historical
continuity. More was not the peer of Erasmus in learning or tolerance;
indeed, his customary gentleness and generosity were sometimes
interrupted by strong passions, even by bigotry; in contro- versy he
stooped now and then, like nearly all his contemporaries, to fierce</p>
<p>CHaP.XXIV) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE 55 1</p>
<p>invective and bitter vituperation. 27 But he was the superior of
Erasmus in courage, sense of honor, and devotion to a cause. The letters
that they ex- changed are a precious testimony t o the graces of an
ungracious age. “Fare - well,” ends one of More’s, “sweetest Erasmus,
dearer to me than my eyes!” 28</p>
<p>He was one of the most religious men of the century, shaming with his
laic piety the wordliness of ecclesiastics like Wolsey. At twenty-three,
when he was already advanced in the study of law, he thought of becoming
a priest. He gave public lectures (1501 ) on Augustine’s City of God,
and such older pundits as Grocyn sat in his audience. Though he
criticized the monks for shirking their rule, he fervently admired the
sincere monastic state, and sometimes regretted that he had not chosen
it. For a long time he wore a horsehair shirt next to his skin; now and
then it drew enough blood to visibly stain his clothing. He believed in
miracles and saintly legends, therapeutic relics, religious images, and
pilgrimages, 29 and wrote devotional works to the medieval tune that
life is a prison, and that the aim of religion and philosophy should be
to prepare us for death. He married twice, and brought up several
children in a Christian discipline at once sober and cheerful, with
frequent prayer, mutual love, and complete trust in Providence. The
“Manor House” in Chelsea, to which he moved in 1523, was famous for its
library and gallery, and its gardens extending for a hundred yards down
to the Thames.</p>
<p>At twenty-six ( 1 504) he was chosen a burgess delegate to
Parliament. There he argued so successfully against a measure proposed
by Henry VII that the King briefly imprisoned and heavily fined the
senior More as a devious means of teaching the young orator the comforts
of conformity. At the close of that Parliament More returned to private
life, and prospered in the practice of law. In 1 509 he was persuaded to
take the office of under- sheriff in the City — i.e., ancient London
north of the Thames. His functions, suiting his temperament, were
judicial rather than adventurous. His judg- ments earned him wide renown
for wisdom and impartiality, and his polite refusal of presents from
litigants violated time-dishonored precedents that were still vigorous
in Francis Bacon’s day. Soon he was back in Parliament; and by 1 5 1 5
he was Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>In a famous letter to Hutten (July 23, 1517) Erasmus described More
as of medium height, pale complexion, auburn hair, careless of dress or
formality, abstemious in food and drink, cheerful with quick humor and
ready smile, inclined to jokes and pranks, and keeping in his house a
jester, a monkey, and many minor animal pets; “all the birds in Chelsea
came to him to be fed.” A faithful husband, a loving and idolized
father, a persuasive orator, a judicious counselor,, a man alert with
charity and friendly offices — “in short,” concluded this fond sketch,
“what did Nature ever create milder, sweeter, and happier than the
genius of Thomas More?” 80</p>
<p>552 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>He found time to write books. He began a History of Richard III , but
as its tenor was sharply against autocracy, and autocracy was on the
throne, he thought it discreet to avoid the fatality of print. It was
published after his death; Shakespeare based a play on it; and the
biography, broadcast by the drama, may bear some responsibility for the
character that Richard bears. In 1516, as if in a playful aside, More
tossed off, in Latin, one of the most famous of all books, creating a
word, setting a precedent and pace for modern utopias, anticipating half
of socialism, and voicing such criticism of English economy, society,
and government that again he put valor behind discretion, and had the
volume published abroad in six Latin editions before allowing it to be
printed, still in Latin, in England. He professed to have written it for
amusement, with no intention to make it public; but he thanked Erasmus
for seeing it through the press at Louvain. 81 It was translated into
German, Italian, and French before the first English version appeared
(1551), sixteen years after the author’s death. By 1520 it was the talk
of the</p>
<p>More had called it Nusquama, Nowhere; we do not know who had the
happy thought of changing this, amid the printing, to the Greek
equivalent Utopia . 32 The mise-en-scene of the tale was so ingenious
that many readers took it as authentic history, and a missionary was
said to have planned to go and convert the Utopians to Christianity. 83
More had been sent by Henry VIII on an embassy to Bruges (1515); thence
he had passed to Antwerp with a letter of introduction from Erasmus to
Peter Giles, the city clerk. The prelude pretended that Giles had
introduced More to a bearded, weather- worn Portuguese mariner, Raphael
Hythlodaye (Greek for “skilled in nonsense”) , who had sailed with
Amerigo Vespucci in 1 504, had made his way round the globe (six years
before Magellan’s voyage), and had visited, in the New World, a happy
island whose inhabitants had solved most of the problems plaguing Europe
at that time. The Louvain edition made the hoax more plausible by
prefixing a woodcut of the isle, and a specimen of the Utopian language.
Only one slip gave the plot away: Hythlodaye di- gresses to praise
Archbishop Morton, 84 in terms more natural to More’s gratitude than to
the mariner’s experience.</p>
<p>The imaginary Magellan describes the communism of the islanders:</p>
<p>Among the Utopians … all things being common, every man hath</p>
<p>abundance of everything. … I compare with them so many nations</p>
<p>. . . where every man calleth that, which he hath gotten, his own</p>
<p>proper and private goods I hold well with Plato . . . that all
men</p>
<p>should have and enjoy equal portions of wealth and commodities.</p>
<p>. . . For where every man, under certain titles and pretenses,
draweth and plucketh to himself as much as he can, so that a few divide
among</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE</p>
<p>themselves all the whole riches . . . there to the residue is left
lack and</p>
<p>poverty. 85</p>
<p>In Utopia each man takes his product to the common store, and
receives from it according to his needs. None asks more than enough, for
security from want forestalls greed. Meals are eaten in common, but if a
man wishes he may eat at home. There is no money in Utopia, no buying
cheap and selling dear; the evils of cheating, stealing, and quarreling
over property are unknown. Gold is used not as currency but to make
useful things, like chamber pots. No famines or lean years come, for the
communal storehouses maintain a reserve against emergencies. Every
family engages in both agriculture and industry, men and women alike. In
order to ensure adequate production, six hours of work per day are
required of each adult, and choice of occu- pation is limited by
collective needs. The Utopians are free in the sense of freedom from
hunger and fear, but they are not free to live on the labor of others.
There are laws in Utopia, but they are simple and few; therefore every
man is expected to plead his own case, and no lawyers are allowed. Those
who violate the laws are condemned for a time to serve the commu- nity
as bondmen; they do the more disagreeable tasks; but after finishing
their turn they are restored to full equality with their fellow men.
Those who repeatedly and seriously offend are put to death. The supply
of bond- men is raised by ransoming prisoners condemned to death in
other lands.</p>
<p>The unit of society in Utopia is the patriarchal family. “The wives
be ministers to their husbands, the children to their parents.” 36 Mon
ogamy is the only form of sexual union permitted. Before marriage the
betrothed are advised to view each other naked, so that physical defects
may be revealed in time; and if they are serious the contract may be
annulled. The wife after marriage goes t o live with her husband in his
father’s household. Di - vorce is allowed for adultery and by free
mutual consent, conditional on the consent of the communal council.
Annually every thirty families choose a phylarch to govern them; every
ten phylarchs choose a chief phylarch to administer a district of 300
households. The 200 phylarchs serve as a na- tional council, which
elects for life the prince or king.</p>
<p>A basic obligation of the phylarchs is to preserve the health of the
com- munity by providing clean water, public sanitation, medical and
hospital care; for health is the chief of all earthly boons. The rulers
organize edu- cation for children and for adults; they stress vocational
training, support science, and discourage astrology, fortunetelling, and
superstition. They may make war on other peoples if they judge that the
good of the com- munity so requires. “They count this the most just
cause of war, when any people holdeth a piece of ground void and vacant
to no good nor profitable use, keeping other from the use or possession
of it, who … by die law of</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>nature ought thereby to be nourished and relieved.” 87 (Was this a
defense of the colonization of America?) But the Utopians do not glorify
war; “they hate it as plainly brutal . . . and, contrary to the
sentiment of nearly every other nation, they regard nothing more
inglorious than glory derived from war .” 88</p>
<p>Religion in Utopia is almost, not quite, free. Tolerance is given to
any creed except atheism and the denial of human immortality. The
Utopian may, if he wishes, worship the sun or the moon. But those who
use violence of action or speech against any recognized religion are
arrested and punished, for the laws seek to prevent religious strife .
89 Deniers of immortality are not punished, but they are excluded from
office, and are forbidden to voice their views to any but priests and
“men of gravity.” Otherwise “it should be law - ful for every man to
favor and follow what religion he would . . . and might do his best to
bring other to his opinion, so that he did it peaceably . . . and
soberly, without haste and contentious rebuking and inveighing against
other.” 40 So in Utopia there are various religions, but “the most and
wisest part . . . believe that there is a certain godly power unknown,
everlasting, incomprehensible, inexplicable, far above the reach and
capacity of man’s wit, dispersed through t he world.” 41 Monasticism is
permitted, provided the monks will busy themselves with works of charity
and communal utility, such as repairing roads and bridges, cleaning
ditches, cutting timber, and acting as servants, even as bondmen; and
they may marry if they so desire. There are priests, but they too marry.
The state keeps as religious feasts the first and last of every month
and year, but in the religious exercises of these holydays “no image of
any god is seen in the church,” and “no prayers be used but such as
every man may boldly pronounce without the offending of any sect.” 42 On
each of these holydays wives and children prostrate them - selves before
their husbands or parents, and ask forgiveness for any offense
committed, or any duty omitted; and no one is to come to church until he
has made peace with his enemy. — It is a Christian touch, but More’s
youthful humanism appears in his partial acceptance of the Greek view of
suicide: if a man suffers from a painful and incurable disease he is
permitted and en- couraged to end his life. In other cases, More
believes, suicide is cowardice, and the corpse is to be “cast unburied
into some stinking marsh.” 48</p>
<p>We do not know how much of this represented More’s considered con -
clusions, how much was Erasmus, how much was half -playful imagination.
However, the young statesman carefully dissociated himself from the
social- ism of his Utopians: “I am of opinion,” he represents himself as
saying to Hythlodaye, “. . . that men shall never live wealthily where
all things are in common. For how can there be abundance of goods . . .
where the regard of his own gains driveth not to work, but the hope that
he hath in other men’s travails maketh him slothful. … It is not
possible for all things to be</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE 555</p>
<p>well unless all men were good — which I think will not be yet these
good many years.” 44 Yet some sympathy with radical yearni ngs must have
inspired so extensive a picture of the communist ideal. Other pages of
the Utopia criti- cize with angry severity the exploitation of the poor
by the rich. Enclosures of once common lands by English lords are
condemned with such detail and spirit as seem unlikely in a foreigner.
Says Hythlodaye to More:</p>
<p>The unreasonable covetousness of a few hath turned to the utter</p>
<p>undoing of your island. . . . Suffer not these rich men to buy up
all,</p>
<p>to engross and forestall, and with their monopoly to keep the market
alone as pleases them. 46 . . . When I consider and weigh in my mind all
these commonwealths which now anywhere flourish, I can per-</p>
<p>ceive nothing — so God help me — but a certain conspiracy of rich men
promoting their own commodities under the name and title of the</p>
<p>commonwealth. They invent and devise all means and crafts . . . how
to hire and abuse . . . the labor of the poor for as little money as may
be. . . . These devices be then made laws. 46</p>
<p>It is almost the voice of Karl Marx moving the world from a foot of
space in the British Museum. Certainly Utopia is one of the most
powerful, as well as one of the first, indictments of the economic
system that continued in modern Europe until the twentieth century; and
it remains as contem- porary as a planned economy and the welfare
state.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>THE MARTYR</li>
</ol>
<p>How did it come about that a man with such ideas seething in his head
should have been appointed to Henry VIII’s council in the year after the
publication of Utopia? Probably the King, despite his reputation for
learn- ing, could not bear to read the book in Latin, and died before it
was Eng- lished. More kept his radical fancies for his friends. Henry
knew him as a rare synthesis of ability and integrity, valued him as a
tie with the House of Commons, knighted him, made him Under-Treasurer
(1521), and entrusted him with delicate tasks of diplomacy. More opposed
the foreign policy by which Wolsey led England i nto war with Charles V
; the Emperor, in More’s view, was not only dangerously resourceful, he
was also the heroic defender of Christendom against the Turks. When
Wolsey fell More so far forgot his manners as to review, in Parliament,
the faults and errors that had caused the fall. As leader of the
opposition he was the logical successor of the Cardi- nal, and for
thirty-one months he served as Chancellor of England.</p>
<p>But the real successor to Wolsey was the King. Henry had discovered
his own power and capacity, and was resolved, he said, to free himself
from an unfriendly and obstructive papacy, and to legitimate his union
with the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>55&lt;5</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>woman whom he loved, and who could give him an heir to the throne.
More found himself no guide of policy, but a servant of aims that ran
counter to his deepest loyalties. He consoled himself by writing books
against Protes- tant theology, and prosecuting Protestant leaders. In A
Dialogue Concern- ing Heresies (1528), and in later works, he agreed
with Ferdinand II, Calvin, and the Lutheran princes on the necessity of
religious unity for national strength and peace. He feared the division
of Englishmen into a dozen or a hundred religious sects. He who had
defended Erasmus’ Latin translation of the New Testament protested
against Tyndale’s English version as distorting the text to prove
Lutheran points; translations of the Bible, he felt, should not be
turned into weapons for tavern philosophers. In any case, he held, the
Church was too precious a vehicle of discipline, consolation, and
inspira- tion to be torn to pieces by the hasty reasoning of vain
disputants.</p>
<p>From this mood he passed to the burning of Protestants at the stake.
The charge that in his own house he had a man flogged for heresy 47 is
disputed; More’s account of the offender seems far removed from
theology: “If he spied any woman kneeling” in prayer, and “if her head
hung anything low in her meditations, then would he steal behind her,
and . . . would labor to lift up all her clothes and cast them quite
over her head.” 48 It may be that in the three death sentences
pronounced in his diocese during his chancellor- ship he was obeying the
law that required the state to serve as the secular arm of
ecclesiastical courts; 49 but there is no doubt that he approved of the
burnings. 60 He admitted no inconsistency between his conduct and the
large toleration of religious differences in his Utopia; for even there
he had refused toleration to atheists, deniers of immortality, and those
heretics who resorted to violence or vituperation. Yet he himself was
guilty of vituperation in arguing against the English Protestants.*</p>
<p>The time came when More thought Henry the most dangerous heretic of
all. He refused to approve the marriage with Anne Boleyn, and he saw in
the anticlerical legislation of 1529-32 a ruinous assault upon a Church
that to his mind stood as an indispensable base of social order. When he
retired from office to the privacy of his Chelsea home (1532), he was
still in his prime at fifty-four, but he suspected that he had not much
longer to live.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIV ) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE 557</p>
<p>He tried to prepare his family for tragedy by talking (so reports his
son-in- law William Roper)</p>
<p>of the lives of holy martyrs, and of . . . their marvelous patience,
and of their passions 〔sufferings〕 and deaths, that they suffered
rather</p>
<p>than they would offend God, and what an happy and a blessed thing it
was, for the love of God, to suffer loss of goods, imprisonment, loss of
lands, and life also. He would further say unto them that upon his
faith, if he might perceive his children would encourage him to die</p>
<p>in a good cause, it should so comfort him that for the very joy
thereof it would make him merrily to run to death. 52</p>
<p>His expectations were fulfilled. Early in 1534 he was indicted on a
charge of having been privy to the conspiracy connected with the Nun of
Kent, He admitted having met her, and having believed her to be
inspired, but h(t denied any knowledge of conspiracy. Cromwell
recommended, Henry granted, forgiveness. But on April 17 More was
committed to the Tower for refusing to take oath to the Act of
Succession, which, as presented to him, involved a repudiation of papal
supremacy over the Church in England. His favorite daughter Margaret
wrote to him begging him to take the oath; he replied that her plea gave
him more pain than his imprisonment. His (second) wife visited him in
the Tower, and (according to Roper) berated him for obstinacy:</p>
<p>What the good year, Mr. More, I marvel that you, that have always</p>
<p>been hitherunto taken for a wise man, will now so play the fool to
lie here in this close, filthy prison, and be content to be shut up
among mice and rats, when you might be abroad at your liberty, and
with</p>
<p>the favor and good will of the King and his Council, if you would</p>
<p>but do as all the bishops and best learned of this realm have
done.</p>
<p>And seeing you have at Chelsea a right fair house, your library, your
books, your gallery, your garden, your orchards, and all other neces-
saries so handsomely about you, where you might, in the company of me,
your wife, your children, and your household, be merry, I muse what a
God’s name you mean here still thus fondly to tarry. 53</p>
<p>Other efforts were made to move him, but he smilingly resisted them
all.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1535, he was given a final trial. He defended himself
well, but he was pronounced guilty of treason. While he was returning
from West- minster to the Tower his daughter Margaret twice broke
through the guard, embraced him, and received his last blessing. On the
day before his execution he sent his hairshirt to Margaret, with a
message that “tomorrow were a day</p>
<p>very meet” to “go to God Farewell, my dear child; pray for me, and
1</p>
<p>shall pray for you and all your friends, that we may merrily meet
in</p>
<p>heaven.” 54 When he mounted the scaffold (July 7), and found it so
weak</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>that it threatened to collapse, he said to an attendant, “I pray you,
Mr. Lieu - tenant, see me safe up, and for my coming down let me shift
for myself.” 66 The executioner asked his forgiveness; More embraced
him. Henry had given directions that only a few words should be allowed
the prisoner. More begged the spectators to pray for him, and to “bear
witness that he . . . suf - fered death in and for the faith of the Holy
Catholic Church.” He then asked them to pray for the King, that God
might give him good counsel; and he protested that he died being the
King’s good servant, but God’s first. 66 He repeated the Fifty-first
Psalm. Then he laid his head upon the block, care- fully arranging his
long gray beard that it should take no harm; “pity that</p>
<p>A wave of terror passed through an England that now realized the
reso- lute mercilessness of the King, and a shudder of horror ran
through Europe. Era smus felt that he himself had died, for “we had but
one soul between us”; 58 he said that he had now no further wish to
live, and a year later he too was dead. Charles V, apprised of the
event, told the English ambassador: “If I had been master of such a
servant, of whose doing I myself have had these many years no small
experience, I would rather have lost the best city in my dominions than
lose such a worthy councilor.” 59 Pope Paul III formu - lated a bull of
excommunication outlawing Henry from the fellowship of Christendom,
interdicting all religious services in England, forbidding all trade
with it, absolving all British subjects from their oaths of allegiance
to the King, and commanding them, and all Christian princes, to depose
him forthwith. As neither Charles nor Francis would consent to such
measures, the Pope withheld issuance of the bull till 1538. When he did
promulgate it Charles and Francis forbade its publication in their
realms, unwilling to sanction papal claims to power over kings. The
failure of the bull signalized again the decline of papal authority and
the rise of the sovereign national state.</p>
<p>Dean Swift thought More the man “of the greatest virtue”— perhaps
using this word in its old sense of courage — “this kingdom ever
produced.” 60 On the four hundredth anniversary of their execution the
Church of Rome en- rolled Thomas More and John Fisher among her
saints.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>A TALE OF THREE QUEENS</li>
</ol>
<p>Within some thirty mo nths of More’s death Henry lost three of his
six queens. Catherine of Aragon wasted away in her northern retreat,
still claim- ing to be Henry’s only lawfully wedded wife and England’s
rightful queen. Her faithful maids continued to give her that title. In
1535 she was removed</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE 559</p>
<p>to Kimbalton Castle, near Huntingdon, and there she confined herself
to one room, leaving it only to hear Mass. She received visitors, and
“used them very obligingly.” 61 Mary, now nineteen, was kept at
Hatfield, only twenty miles away; but mother and daughter were not
allowed to see each other, and were forbidden to communicate. They did
nevertheless, and Catherine’s letters are among the most touching in all
literature. Henry offered them better quarters if they would acknowledge
his new queen; they would not. Anne Boleyn had her aunt made governess
to Mary, and bade her keep “the bastard” in place by “a box on the ears
now and then.” 62 In Decem ber 1535, Catherine sickened, made her will,
wrote to the Emperor asking him to pro- tect her daughter, and addressed
a moving farewell to her “most dear lord and husband” the King:</p>
<p>The hour of my death now approaching, I cannot choose but, out</p>
<p>of th e love I bear you, advise you of your soul’s health, which
you</p>
<p>ought to prefer above all considerations of the world or flesh
what-</p>
<p>soever; for which yet you have cast me into many calamities, and</p>
<p>yourself into many troubles. But I forgive you all, and pray God
to</p>
<p>do likewise. For the rest I commend unto you Mary our daughter,</p>
<p>beseeching you to be a good father to her. . . . Lastly I make this
vow, that my eyes desire you above all things. Farewell. 63</p>
<p>Henry wept on receiving the letter; and when Catherine died (January
7,</p>
<p>1536), aged fifty, he ordered the court to go into mourning. Anne
refused. 64</p>
<p>Anne could not know that within five months she too would be dead;
but she knew that she had already lost the King. Her hot temper, her
imperious tantrums, her importunate demands, wearied Henry, who
contrasted her railing tongue with Catherine’s gentleness. 65 On the day
of Catherine’s burial Anne was delivered of a dead child; and Henry, who
still yearned for a son, began to think of another divorce — or, as he
would put it, an annulment; his second marriage, he was quoted as
saying, had been induced by witchcraft, and was therefore void. 66 From
October 1535 he began to pay special atten- tion to one of Anne’s maids,
Jane Seymour. When Anne r eproached him he bade her bear with him
patiently, as her betters had done. 67 Perhaps follow- ing ancient
tactics, he accused her of infidelity. It seems incredible that even a
flighty woman should have risked her throne for a moment’s dalliance,
but the King appears to have sincerely believed in her guilt. He
referred the rumors of her amours to his Council; it investigated, and
reported to the King that she had committed adultery with five members
of the court — Sir William Brereton, Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis
Weston, Mark Smeton, and her brother Lord Rochford. The five men were
sent to the Tower, and on May 2,1536, Anne followed them.</p>
<p>Henry wrote to her holding out hopes of forgiveness or lenience if
she</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>560</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>would be honest with him. She replied that she had nothing to
confess. Her attendants in prison alleged that she had admitted
receiving proposals of love from Norris and Weston, but that she claimed
to have repulsed them. On May 1 1 the grand jury of Middlesex, having
been asked to make local inquiries into offenses allegedly committed by
the Queen in that county, reported that it found her guilty of adultery
with all five of the accused men, and gave specific names and dates. 68
On May 1 2 four of the men were tried at Westminster by a jury including
Anne’s father, the Earl of Wilt - shire. Smeton confessed himself guilty
as charged; the others pleaded not guilty; all four were convicted. On
May 1 5 Anne and her brother were tried by a panel of twenty-six peers
under the presidency of the Duke of Norfolk, her uncle but political
enemy. Sister and brother affirmed their innocence, but each member of
the panel announced himself convinced of their guilt, and they were
sentenced to be “burned or beheaded, as shall please the King.” On May
17 Smeton was hanged; the other four men were beheaded</p>
<p>On the eve of her death Anne knelt before Lady Kingston, wife of the
warden, and asked a last favor: that she should go and kneel before Mary
and beseech her, in Anne’s name, to forgive the wrongs that had come to
her through the pride and thoughtlessness of a miserable woman. 69 On
May 19 she begged that her execution should take place soon. She
appeared to derive some comfort from the thought that “the executioner I
have heard to be very good, and I have a little neck”— whereupon she
laughed. That noon she was led to the scaffold. She asked the spectators
to pray for the King, “for a gentler and more merciful prince was there
never; and to me he was ever a good, a gentle, and sovereign lord.” 70
No one could be sure of her guilt, but few regretted her fall.</p>
<p>On the day of her death Cranmer gave the King a dispensation to marry
again in renewed quest for a son; on the morrow Henry and Jane Seymour
were secretly betrothed; on May 30, 1536, they were married; and on June
4 she was proclaimed queen. She was of royal lineage, being descended
from Edward III; she was related to Henry in the third or fourth degree
of con- sanguinity, which called for another dispensation from the
obedient Cran- mer. She was of no special beauty, but she impressed all
with her intelligence, kindness, even modesty; Cardinal Pole, Henry’s
most thoroughgoing enemy, described her as “full of goodness.” She
discouraged the King’s advances while Anne lived, refused his gifts,
returned his letters unopened, and asked him never to speak to her
except in the presence of others. 71</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) HENRY VIII AND THOMAS MORE j6l</p>
<p>One of her first acts after marriage was to effect a reconciliation
between Henry and Mary. He did it in his own way. He had Cromwell send
her a paper e ntitled “The Confession of the Lady Mary”: it acknowledged
the</p>
<p>When Parliament met again (June 8, 1536) it drew up at the King’s re
- quest a new Act of Succession, by which both Elizabeth and Mary were
declared illegitimate, and the crown was settled on the prospective
issue of Jane Seymour. In July Henry’s bastard son, the Duke of
Richmond, died; now all the hopes of the King lay in Jane’s pregnancy.
England rejoiced with him when ( October 12,1537) she was delivered of a
boy, the future Edward VI. But poor Jane, to whom the King was now as
deeply attached as his self- centered spirit allowed, died twelve days
after her son’s birth. Henry was for some time a broken man. Though he
married thrice again, he asked, at his death, to be buried beside the
woman who had given her life in bearing his son.</p>
<p>What were the reactions of the English people to the events of this
world- shaking reign? It is difficult to say; the testimony is
prejudiced, ambiguous, and sparse. Chapuys reported in 1533 that, in the
opinion of many English- men, “the last King Richard was never so much
hated by his people as this King.” 72 Generally the people sympathized
with Henry’s desire for a son, condemned his severity to Catherine and
Mary, shed no tears over Anne, but were deeply shocked by the execution
of Fisher and More. The nation was still overwhelmingly Catholic, 78 and
the clergy — now that the govern- ment had appropriated the annates —
were hoping for reconciliation with Rome. But hardly any man dared raise
his voice in criticism of the King. Criticism he received, and from an
Englishman, but one with the Channel between him and the King’s
practiced arm.</p>
<p>Reginald Pole was the son of Margaret Plantagenet, Countess of
Salisbury, herself the niece of Edward IV and Richard III. He was
educated at Henry’s expense, received a royal pension of 500 crowns a
year, and was apparently destined for the highest offices in the English
Church. He studied in Paris and Padua, and returned to England in high
favor with the King. But when Henry insisted on hearing his opinion of
the divorce, Reginald frankly re- plied that he could not approve of it
unless it should be sanctioned by the Pope. Henry continued the youth’s
pension, and permitted him to return</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>562</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>to the Continent. There Pole remained twenty-two years, rose in papal
esteem as scholar and theologian, and was made a card i nal at the age
of thirty-six ( 1 536) . In that year he composed in Latin a passionate
attack upon Henry — Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione (In Defense
of Church Unity). He argued that Henry’s assumption of ecclesiastical
supremacy in England invited the division of the Christian religion into
national varieties, and that the resultant clash of creeds would bring
social and political chaos to Europe. He charged Henry with egomania and
autocracy. He scored the English bishops for yielding to the enslavement
of the Church by the state. He denounced the marriage with Anne as
adultery, and predicted (not too wisely) that the English nobility would
forever rank Eli zabeth as “a harlot’s bastard.” 74 He called upon
Charles V to waste no ammunition on the Turks, but to turn the Imperial
forces against England’s impious King. It was a powerful invective,
spoiled by youthful pride in eloquence. Cardinal Conta- rini advised the
author not to publish it, but Pole insisted, and sent a copy to England.
When Paul III made Pole a cardinal Henry took it as an act of war. The
King abandoned all thought of compromise, and agreed with Cromwell that
the monasteries of England should be dissolved, and their property added
to the Crown.</p>
