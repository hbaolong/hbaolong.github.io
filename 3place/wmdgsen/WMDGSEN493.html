Campaign</h4>
<p>1758-74</p>

<li><p>Development</p></li>
</ol>
<p>T HE family was of Swiss-Germanic origin, like those virile stocks
that make Bern and Zurich proud and prosperous today. One member, in
Neuchatel, took the name Schweitzer — i.e., Swiss; another, who removed
to the Netherlands, bore the name Helvetius — i.e., Swiss. This second
branch moved to Paris about 1680. There Jean Claude Adrien Helvetius
became physician to Queen Marie Leszczynska. Of his twenty children the
one who here concerns us was born January 26, 1715. Claude Adrien was
reared in the odor of medicine, which left some trace in his philosophy.
After studying under the Jesuits at the College Louis-le-Grand he was
apprenticed to a tax collector. Soon he was rich; at the age of twenty-
three he had an income of 360,000 livres per year. 1 He was handsome, a
good fencer, dancer, and shot, a favorite with courtiers and courtesans.
He was appointed maitre d’hotel— master of the household — to the Queen.
He was thoroughly unprepared to become a philosopher — except of the
kind that is too clever to write books.</p>
<p>But in 1738 he met Voltaire, was awed by his mind and fame, and began
to dream of authorship; would it not be a novel distinction to be at
once a financier and a philosopher? He spent some time at Bordeaux as
the guest of Montesquieu, and then in Burgundy with Buffon; these were
formative influences. He became a close friend with another millionaire,
Baron d’Hol - bach, the archmaterialist of the age. At the Baron’s
dinners, and in the salon of Mme. de Grafligny, he met Diderot, Grimm,
Rousseau, Duel os, Galiani, Marmontel, Turgot. He was transformed.</p>
<p>In 1751 he made two fateful decisions. He abandoned his lucrative
post as a farmer general of taxes, retired to a feudal estate at
Vore-au-Perche, and devoted himself to writing a book that would move
the world. In the same year, aged thirty- six, he married Anne Catherine
de Ligniville d’Autri - court, a countess of the Holy Roman Empire, aged
thirty-two, one of the</p>
<p>680</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 68 1</p>
<p>most beautiful and accomplished women in France. He took her at once
to Vore, for fear, said Grimm, that Paris would tarnish her. There — or
was it in Paris? — Fontenelle, nearing one hundred, entered the dressing
room of the</p>
<p>The happy couple maintained also a house in Paris, and there
Helvetius’ hospitality, graced by his wife’s charms, drew to them such
intellectual lions as Diderot, d’Holbach, Fontenelle, Buffon,
d’Alembert, Turgot,</p>
<p>Galiani, Morellet, Condorcet, and Hume. “You should see,” said Marmon
- tel, “how agreeable his home became for literary men.” 3 At those
dinners Helvetius tried to guide the conversation to the themes on which
he planned to write; he invited criticism of his ideas, and showed
himself a good listener; Morellet complained that Helvetius “was always
composing his book in company.” 4</p>
<p>After seven years of incubation the beloved volume came forth, July
15, 1758, as De I’Esprit ( On Intelligence). To the surprise of the
friends who had seen it in manuscript, it appeared with the precious
“privilege of the King.” Malesherbes had delegated to Jean Pierre
Tercier the task of censor- ing it; Tercier reported: “I have found
nothing in it which in my judg - ment ought to prevent its publication.”
5 On August 6 the advocate general of the Paris Parlement branded the
book a mass of heresies; on August 10 the Council of State revoked the
privilege to print; soon Tercier was ousted from his lucrative posts.
The amiable author protested that he had made no attack upon
Christianity. “O f what impiety can they accuse me? I have in no part of
this work denied the Trinity, or the divinity of Jesus, or the
immortality of the soul, or the resurrection of the dead, or any other
article of the papal creed; I have not therefore in any way attacked re-
ligion.” 6 Voltaire, fearing that Helvetius would be sent to the
Bastille, ad - vised him to travel. But Helvetius was too comfortable at
home to sacri- fice so much for a book. He issued a retraction in the
form of a letter to a priest; and when the government declared this
inadequate he signed an apology “so humiliating,” wrote Grimm, “that one
would not have been astonished to see a man take refuge with the
Hottentots rather than put his name to such avowals.” 7 Mme. Helvetius
came to Ver sailles to intercede for her husband; the government
contented itself with ordering him to re- tire to his estate for two
years. The penalty might have been more severe had not the King
remembered that his own life had once been saved by Helvetius’ fat her,
then physician to the Queen. On January 3, 1759, Pope Clement XIII
condemned the book as scandalous and licentious; and in February it was
publicly burned by order of the Parlement. We have seen how this “fuss
over an omelet,” as Voltaire called it, shared with d’Alem -</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>bert’s article on Geneva in leading to the suppression of the
Encyclopedic. With all this advertising De F Esprit became the most
widely read of all the volumes that played a part in the campaign
against Christianity. Twenty editions appeared in French within six
months, and it was soon translated into English and German. Today only a
few scholars know of it, and it is almost impossible to obtain.</p>
<p>Helvetius published no more, but he continued to write. Leisurely but
angrily he restated and amplified his views in the treatise De FHonmte (
On Man), which attacked priests as venal peddlers of hope and fear,
perpetu- ators of ignorance, and murderers of thought. In these two
books we find all the ideals of that ambitious time: liberty, equality,
and fraternity: liberty of speech, press, assembly, and worship,
equality for both sexes and all classes in educational opportunity and
before the law, and an almost social- istic advocacy of the “welfare
state” as a compensatory protection of the simple poor against the
clever rich — all capped with a semireligious faith in the indefinite
perfectibility of mankind. Here again, if we listen well, is the voice
of the Revolution.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Philosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Like nearly all the philo sophes, Helvetius begins with Locke: all
ideas are derived from sensation, therefore from the experience of the
individual. All mental states are combinations of sensations felt at
present, or revived from the past through memory, or projected into the
future through imagi- nation. Judgment is the sensation of differences
among sensations; and rea- son is a combination of judgments.</p>
<p>Mind and soul are not the same: mind is an assemblage or sequence of
mental states; soul is the sensitivity of the organism, the capacity to
receive sensations. All sensation is physical, all soul is a power in
matter. “All the phenomena of medicine and natural history evidently
prove that this power… begins with the formation of the bodily organs,
lasts as long as they last, and is destroyed with their dissolution.” 8
Animals have souls. Man became superior to the beasts through the
development of upright stature, which gradually turned his forefeet into
hands capable of grasping (com-pre-hend- ing) and manipulating
objects.</p>
<p>Having begun with Locke, Helvetius proceeds with Hobbes. All action
is desire responding to sensations present or recalled. Desire is the
memory of the pleasure that attended certain sensations. Passion is a
persisting de- sire, and varies in intensity according to the pain or
pleasure remembered and expected. The passions often lead us into error
because they fix our attention upon some particular part of an object or
a situation, not allow-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>683</p>
<p>ing us to view it on every side. 9 (In this sense intelligence is the
delay of reaction to allow wider perception and fuller response.)
Nevertheless pas- sions are to character what motion is to matter; they
supply the drive, even the drive for knowledge. “The mental achievement
of a person varies with the intensity of his passions. The man of genius
is a man of strong pas- sions; the stupid man is devoid of them.” 10 The
basic passion is love of power, and this is basic because it enlarges
our ability to realize our desires.</p>
<p>Up to this point Helvetius’ work deserved Voltaire’ s description of
it as an “omelet”— a mingling of ideas long current in the philosophical
world. But now he advanced to his most distinctive propositions. Since
all ideas come from the individual’s experiences, diversity in the ideas
and character</p>
<p>At the moment the child is delivered from the womb… he enters</p>
<p>life without ideas and without passions. The only one he feels is
that of hunger. It is not in the cradle [not from heredity] that we
received</p>
<p>he passions of pride, avarice, ambition, the desire for esteem
and</p>
<p>glory. These factious passions, generated amid towns and cities, pre-
suppose conventions and laws already established among men….</p>
<p>Such passions would be unknown to him who was carried by a storm, at
the moment of his birth, to a desert waste, and, like Romulus,</p>
<p>nourished by a wolf…. The love of glory is an acquisition, and</p>
<p>herefore the effect of instruction. 12</p>
<p>Even the genius is the product of environment — i.e., of experience
plus circumstance. The genius adds the last step in an invention to many
steps taken before him, and this final step is due to circumstance.
“Every new idea is the gift of chance”— i.e., to “a series of effects of
which we do not perceive the c ause.” 13</p>
<p>Whence proceeds the extreme inequality of understanding? Because
nobody perceives precisely the same objects, nor is precisely in the</p>
<p>same situation, nor has received the same education; and because</p>
<p>chance, which presides over our instruction, does not conduct all men
to mines equally rich and fruitful. It is therefore to education — taken
in the fullest extent that we can give to this term, and in which the
idea of chance is also included, that we are to refer the inequality of
under- standing. 14</p>
<p>684</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Probably this psychological analysis — especially generous in a
millionaire — was derived from a political attitude. Conservatives
stress the differences and influence of heredity, and the need for
caution in changing institutions rooted in natural and native
inequalities of ability and character. Reformers stress the differences
and influence of environment, by which inequalities of ability, power,
and wealth seem due to chance — to the accidents of birth and the
privileges of condition rather than to innate merit; inequality can
therefore be reduced by equalizing education and bettering the environ-
ment. Helvetius applies his theory of natural equality to races as well
as to individuals: all races would have reached equal development if
their en- vironmental opportunities had been equal. Consequently
national pride, like pride of person or class, has no warrant in
reality. “The liberty of which the English are so proud… is less the
reward of their courage than the gift of fortune”— i.e., of the
protective Channel and seas. (Internal liberty, other things equal,
varies inversely as external danger.)</p>
<p>Obviously, on these premises, the road of progress follows the
improve- ment of education, society, and government. “Education is
capable of ef - fecting everything”; does it not teach the bear to dance
? 15 All progress, even in morals, depends upon the spread of knowledge
and the training of intelligence; “destroy ignorance, and you will
destroy all the seeds of moral</p>
<p>Here Helvetius, while not denying any Christian dogma, enters upon a
passionate plea for the curtailment of ecclesiastical power in France.
He attacks the Church from a social rather than a theological
standpoint. He denounces the Catholic glorification of celibacy and
poverty, but rejoices that very few Christians take these ideas
seriously; “a secret incredulity fre - quently opposes the pernicious
effect of religious principles.” 18 Catholic control of education, he
charges, not only retards the technical advance of a nation by slighting
science, but it enables the clergy to form the mind of the child to
priestly domination. 19</p>
<p>The desire of the clergy in all times has been to be powerful and</p>
<p>opulent. By what method can it satisfy this desire? By selling
hope</p>
<p>and fear. The priests, wholesale dealers in these commodities, were
sensible that this sale would be assured and lucrative. 20… The</p>
<p>power of the priest depends upon the superstitions and stupid
credulity of the people. It is of little worth to him that they be
learned; the</p>
<p>less they know, the more docile they will be to his dictates. 31…</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>685</p>
<p>In every religion the first objective of the priests is to stifle the
curi-</p>
<p>osity of men, to prevent the examination of every dogma whose absurd-
ity is too palpable to be concealed. 22… Alan is born ignorant, but he
is not born a fool; and it is not without labor that he is made one.
That he should be made such, and be able to extinguish in himself his
natural light, much art and method must be employed; instruction must
heap upon him error upon error. 23… There is nothing which the sacer-
dotal power cannot execute by the aid of superstition. For by that it
robs the magistrates of their authority and kings of their legitimate
power; thereby it subdues the people, and acquires a power over them
which is frequently superior to the laws; and thereby it finally
corrupts the very principles of morality. 21</p>
<p>Helvetius adds eight chapters on toleration.</p>
<p>Religious intolerance is the daughter of sacerdotal ambition and</p>
<p>stupid credulity. 23… If I believe mv nurse and my tutor, every</p>
<p>other religion is false, mine alone is the truth. But is it
acknowledged as such by the universe? No: the earth still groans under
the multitude of temples consecrated to error. 26… What does the history
of</p>
<p>religions teach us? That they have everywhere lighted up the torch of
intolerance, strewed the plains with corpses, imbrued the fields with
blood, burned cities, and laid waste empires. 27… Are not the Turks,
whose religion is a religion of blood, more tolerant than we? We see
Christian churches at Constantinople, but there are no mosques in</p>
<p>Paris. 28… Toleration subjects the priest to the prince; intolerance
subjects the prince to the priest. 29</p>
<p>Helvetius is inclined to make one exception in favor of
intolerance:</p>
<p>There is one cause in which toleration can be detrimental to a
peo-</p>
<p>ple, and that is when it tolerates a religion that is intolerant,
such as the Catholic. This religion, becoming the most powerful in a
state, will al- ways shed the blood of its stupid protectors…. Let not
the insinuat- ing manner of the Catholics impose upon the Protestants.
The same priests who in Prussia regard intolerance as an abomination and
an</p>
<p>infraction of natural and divine law look on tolerance in France as
a</p>
<p>crime and a heresy. What renders the same man so different in differ-
ent countries? His weakness in Prussia and his power in France. When we
consider the conduct of Catholic Christians they at first, when</p>
<p>feeble, appear to be lambs; but when strong they are tigers. 30</p>
<p>Helvetius had a good word to say, now and then, for Christianity,
espe- cially for Protestantism. He was not an atheist, but he abhorred
the Biblical conception of God as “resembling an Oriental tyrant,…
punishing</p>
<p>686</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>slight faults with eternal torments.” 31 He hoped for a “universal
religion” which, under state control, would promote a “natural morality”
free from rewards and punishments after death. 32 He put human reason
above all human claims to a divine revela tion. “An honest man will
always obey his reason in preference to revelation; for it is, he will
say, more certain that God is the author of human reason… than that he
is the author of a particular book.” 33</p>
<p>But are not supernatural beliefs, and a divine sanction, necessary to
the efficacy of a moral code? Not at all, says Helvetius.</p>
<p>It is not on religion… but on legislation alone that the vices,
the</p>
<p>virtues, the power, and the felicity of the people depend…. Every</p>
<p>crime not punished by the laws is daily committed; what stronger</p>
<p>proof can there be of the inutility of religion?… Whence arises</p>
<p>he present security of Paris? From the devotion of its
inhabitants?</p>
<p>No,… from the regularity and vigil of the police…. At what</p>
<p>period did Constantinople become the sink of all the vices? At the
very time the Christian religion was established…. The most
Christian</p>
<p>kings have not been the greatest monarchs. Few of them have dis-</p>
<p>played the virtues of Titus, Trajan, or Antoninus. What pious
prince</p>
<p>can be compared with these ? 34</p>
<p>Hence it seemed to Helvetius that the task of philosophy was to
devise and promote a morality independent of religious belief. From this
point of view he wrote what one student has called “the most scientific
examination of social ethics to appear from the pen of any philosopher
He was re- solved neither to berate nor to idealize human nature; he
would take it as he found it, with all its selfishness, and try to build
upon it a natural ethic. By nature man is neither good nor bad; he is a
creature trying to preserve himself in a world where every organism will
sooner or later be eaten by another. 36 The picture that Rousseau had
recently given of primitive society seemed to Helvetius a jejune
imagination; Hobbes was nearer the truth in describing the “state of
nature” as a war of each against all. 37 The terms good and bad, as
applied to men, have sense only in society; all goodness is social
virtue, and is a product of social training for social ends.</p>
<p>Unhappy is the prince who confides in the original goodness of</p>
<p>character. M. Rousseau supposes its existence, experience denies it;
whoever consults this will learn that the child kills flies, beats his
dog, strangles his sparrow — that the child… has all the vices of the
man.</p>
<p>The man in power [freed from social restraints] is often unjust;
the</p>
<p>sturdy child is the same; when he is not checked by the presence of
his mates he appropriates by force, like the man in power, the sweet-
meat or plaything of his companion. 38</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>687</p>
<p>Obviously, then, there is no innate moral sense; all judgments of
right and wrong are developed during the experience of the individual
from the teachings and compulsions of his family, his community, his
government, and his church. When the individual is freed from these
compulsions — as in absolute rule, war, or a crowd — he tends to revert
to lawlessness and im- morality; and in “most nations morality is now
nothing more than a collec - tion of the… precepts dictated by the
powerful to secure their authority and to be unjust with impunity.” But
morality properly understood is “the science of the means invented by
men to live together in the happiest manner…. If those in power do not
oppose its progress, this science will advance in proportion as the
people acquire new knowledge.” 39</p>
<p>Helvetius is a frank hedonist: the goal of life is happiness here on
earth, happiness is a continuity of pleasure, and all pleasure is
basically sensual or physiological. 40 “The activity of the mind and the
acquisition of knowl - edge” are the most permanently satisfying
pleasures, 41 but they too are</p>
<p>To be virtuous it is necessary to unite nobleness of soul with an
en-</p>
<p>lightened understanding. Whoever combines these gifts conducts him-
self by the compass of public utility. This utility is the principle of
all human virtues, and the foundation of all legislation… All laws</p>
<p>should follow a single principle, the utility of the public — i.e.,
of the greatest number of the persons under the same government… This
principle contains all morality and legislation. 42</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in Helvetius’ view all actions, however moral and
virtuous, are egoistic. They are not necessarily selfish; many actions
are altruistic in the sense that they are intended to benefit others,
sometimes at great cost to the agent; but even these actions are
egoistic in the sense that they are motivated by the impulse to
self-satisfaction; we are altruistic because, by instinct or training,
we can take great pleasure in pleasing others; so the mother may
sacrifice herself for her child, as the hero for his country. When we do
good to others it is because we consciously or unconsciously remember
with pleasure the returned love, or the social approval, that followed
similar actions in the past; in this way certain altruistic deeds may
become habitual, and we may feel discomfort or fear if we do not perform
them. Religious asceticism or devotion may appear to be highly virtuous,
but it is only a long- term investment in celestial securities. “If a
hermit or a monk imposes upon himself the law of silence, flogs himself
every night,</p>
<p>688</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>lives on pulse and water, sleeps on straw,… he thinks by virtue of
emacia- tion to gain a fortune in heaven.” 43 If a cruel action is not
condemned by the local community, these holy men will commit it without
shame or re- course, as in burning heretics. 44 Even friendship is
egoistic: it is an exchange of services, if only of ears; where such
exchange ceases, friendship fades; “nothing is more uncommon than a
friendship of long standing.” 45 “Ulti - mately it is always ourselves
that we love in others.” 40</p>
<p>Whereas La Rochefoucauld, in similarly reducing all motives to
self-</p>
<p>love, deplored it as a vice, Helvetius accepts it as a virtue insofar
as it makes for self- preservation. In any case it is a universal fact
of life; and “to be offended by the operations of self-love is to
complain of the showers of spring, the heats of summer,… the frosts of
winter.” 47 It is precisely upon the universality of self- love that he
proposes to establish a “scientific” morality. Education and legislation
can mold character and habit into finding discomfort in unsocial
actions, and pleasure in virtue — i.e., in action beneficial to the
group. The philosopher should study human behavior and social needs with
a view to discovering what forms of conduct are most beneficial to the
largest number of people, and he should plead with edu- cators and
legislators to provide inducements and deterrents that, by appeal- ing
to self-love, will encourage social behavior. What benefits would accrue
to mankind from such an entente between philosophers and kings! “The
virtues and happiness of a people come not from the sanctity of their
re- ligion, but from the wisdom of their laws.” 48</p>
<p>So, as the summit of his philosophy, Helvetius turned to study
legislation and government. Politically he is the most radical of the
philosophes. He does not share Voltaire’s faith in “enlightened
despots”; such rulers would tend to suppress any opinions but their own,
which might be mistaken and injurious. He quotes Frederick the Great as
saying to the Berlin Academy, “Nothing is better than an arbitrary
government under princes just,</p>
<p>humane, and virtuous; but nothing is worse under the common race of
kings.” 49 A limited or constitutional monarchy like England’s is good;
better is a federation of democratic republics pledged to united action
against an aggressor. 50 Theoretically aristocracy is unjust, since
superior ability is a product of chance; but complete democracy is
undesirable as long as the poor are uneducated and propertyless;
consequently a wise legislator will aim to spread education and
property.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>689</p>
<p>If the corruption of the people in power is never more manifest than
in the ages of the greatest luxury, it is because in those ages the
riches of a nation are collected into the smallest number of hands.
52</p>
<p>The replacement of land with money as the symbol and fulcrum of</p>
<p>power engenders such a race for riches as disturbs all social
stability, sharpens the class war, and leads to a ruinous inflation.</p>
<p>In a nation gradually increasing in wealth and money — especially</p>
<p>paper money — the cost of commodities and labor will continually</p>
<p>rise…. As labor becomes very dear in a rich nation, that nation
will</p>
<p>import more from other nations than it will export to them. If all
other factors remain the same,… the money of the rich nation will
in-</p>
<p>sensibly pass to the poorer nation, which, becoming opulent in turn,
will ruin itself in the same way. 53</p>
<p>Is there any escape from the concentration of wealth and the scramble
for money?</p>
<p>One would be to multiply the number of proprietors by making a</p>
<p>new distribution of the land…. When a man’s lands exceed a certain
number of acres, they should be taxed at a rate exceeding the rent.</p>
<p>… Such a redistribution is made almost impossible in a money</p>
<p>economy,… [but] if wisely conceived it could be executed by</p>
<p>continual and insensible alterations. 54</p>
<p>Diminish the riches of some, augment those of others, and put the
poor in such a state of ease that they may by seven or eight hours per
day abun- dantly provide for the wants of themselves and their families.
Then a people will become as happy as the nature of man will allow.

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Influence</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, in two books and one man, are almost all the ideas that made
the French Revolution, and almost all the ideas that agitate nations
today. No wonder educated Frenchmen, in the third quarter of the
eighteenth century, ranked Helvetius as almost the equal of Voltaire,
Rousseau, and Diderot, and gave his first book such popularity and
acclaim as was hardly accorded to any other volume of the age. “No
book,” said Brunetiere, “has made more noise in its time, or spread
abroad more ideas destined to make their way in the world.” 56 Brissot
reported in 1775 that “the system of Helvetius has the greatest vogue”;
Turgot, while opposing it, complained that it was praised “with a kind
of fury”; another described it as “found on</p>
<p>690</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>every toilette table.” 57 All critics commended the clarity of its
style, the force of its epigrams, and the evident humanitarianism of a
man who, hav- ing everything, advocated a redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>However, the philosophes them selves criticized his “system” as based
on erroneous conceptions. Voltaire defended the claims of heredity; all
men are not at birth equal in potential excellence of mind and
character; geniuses, he thought, are born, not made. 58 Diderot agreed
with Voltaire. In a Refutation de Fouvrage d.’’ Helvetius intitule U
Homme (written in 1775, but not published till a hundred years later) he
argued that sensations are transformed differently in different
individuals by inherited differences in the structure of the brain.
59</p>
<p>Man is not born blank. True, he is born without ideas and without</p>
<p>directed passions; but from the first moment of his life he is
endowed with a predisposition to conceive, compare, and retain some
ideas with more relish than others; and with dominant tendencies later
resulting in actual passions. 60</p>
<p>Here Diderot, who had begun with Locke, turned back to Leibniz and
held out a hand to Kant. The influence of environment and schooling, in
Diderot’s view, is always limited by heredity. “We cannot give what</p>
<p>nature has refused; perhaps we destroy what she gives…. Education im-
proves her gifts.” 61 He resented the reduction of intellectual delights
to sensual pleasure, and joined in the general outcry against Helvet
ius’ notion that all altruism is egoism unconscious or concealed.</p>
<p>Mme. du Deffand was one of the few who agreed on this point with
Helvetius. “This man,” she said, “has revealed everybody’s secret [Cest
un homme qui a dit le secret de tout le monde ].” 62 Adam Smith,
following his friend Hume, insisted that altruism was founded upon
feelings of sym- pathy as innate as egoism; but in The Wealth of Nations
he based his economic theory on the universality of self-love. Mme.
Roland, in the ecstasies of the Revolution, was repelled by Helvetius.
“I felt myself im - pelled by a generosity which he never recognized…. I
confronted his theories with the great… heroes that history has
immortalized.” 63</p>
<p>These problems cannot be solved in a paragraph. It seems clear that
differences in hereditary or congenital constitution substantially
affect the operation of environment and education; how else shall we
explain the quite diverse character and development of brothers despite
the similarity of origin and opportunities? And yet Helvetius was on the
right track: within the limits decreed by heredity, immense changes can
be effected in the behavior of individuals and groups by differences in
environment, education, and legislation; how else shall we explain the
emergence of man</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>from barbarism to civilization? — Perhaps we should admit to
Helvetius that no one consciously acts in a way more painful than its
alternative. But certain social instincts — maternal love,
gregariousness, love of approval — though they cannot rival the
individualistic instincts in total force, are strong enough to generate
altruistic actions before any conscious weighing of pleasure, pain, or
result. Each of us is an ego, but some of us spread our egos to include
our family, community, country, or mankind. In this sense the largest
egos are the best.</p>
<p>In any case many men were moved to thought and action by Helvetius’
ideas. It was probably under his influence that La Chalotais began his
cam- paign to replace the schools of village priests, and the Jesuit
colleges, with a system of education controlled by the state. The public
schools of Amer- ica go back to the proposals of Condorcet, who called
himself a disciple of Helvetius. 64 Beccaria testified that the works of
Helvetius inspired him to write his historic plea for the reform of
penal law and policy. Bentham declared: “I owe to Helvetius’ De PEsprit
a great part of my ideas”— in- cluding the utilitarian principle of
seeking in morality and in legislation the greatest happiness of the
greatest number. 65 The National Convention of 1792 certified its sense
of Helvetius’ influence on the Revolution by giving his daughters the
title piles de la nation. William Godwin based his Enquiry concerning
Political Justice (1793) upon the teachings of Helvetius; and Godwin’s
wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, was led to compose her epochal Rights of
Woman (1792) partly by Hel vetius’ claim that the intellectual
inequalities between the sexes were largely due to inequalities of
education and opportunity. 66</p>
<p>Many of Helvetius’ contemporaries contrasted his theory of universal
egoism with the kindness of his character and the benevolence of his
life. Marmontel wrote of him: “There could not be a better man; liberal
and generous without ostentation, and beneficent from the goodness of
his heart.” 67 Grimm, seldom lavish in praise, described Helvetius as a
“true gentleman,” just, indulgent, free from all ill-humor, a good
husband, a good father, a good friend, a good man. 68 True of himself
were the words that Helvetius wrote in De l’ Esprit:</p>
<p>In order to love mankind we must expect little from them….</p>
<p>Every man, so long as his passions do not obscure his reason, will
al- ways be more indulgent in proportion as he is more enlightened….</p>
<p>If the great man is always the most indulgent,… if he pours over</p>
<p>he faults of others the lenient balm of pity, and is slow in
discovering those faults, it is because the elevation of his mind will
not permit him to expatiate upon the vices and follies of individual
persons, but only upon those of mankind in general. 69</p>
<p>692</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>At Vore and in Paris he lived with his wife and children an idyl of
devo- tion and happiness. In 1764 he traveled in England and Germany,
met Hume and Gibbon and Frederick the Great. In 1770 he shared in
financing Pigalle’s statue of Voltaire. He died in 1771, with d’Holbach
and other friends at his bedside. His widow, loving his memory, refused
all suitors for her hand, including Benjamin Franklin. She survived her
husband by twenty-nine years, passed through the Revolution safely, and
died in 1 800, aged eighty-one.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>AUXILIARIES</li>
</ol>
<p>A very swarm of minor philosophes, in the third quarter of the eight-
eenth century, joined in the attack upon Christianity. They labored with
all the industry and enthusiasm of early Christians spreading the new
Gospel, or of Spanish Christians expelling Moors. They poured forth a
stream of tracts and treatises, and when their own profusion ebbed they
translated all the antireligious literature they could find, from
Lucretius to Hobbes. They devised a new calendar of saints and martyrs,
canonizing Julian the Apostate and idolizing Pomponazzi, Bruno,
Campanella, Vanini, Bayle, and other victims of persecution. They
condemned the Jews not for charging interest on loans but for having
begotten Christianity. They de- throned Jehovah as a monster of cruelty,
a god of war, the first of the genocides. They laughed at original sin,
and the God who had to send himself down to earth as his son, to be
scourged and crucified to appease the anger of himself as Father piqued
by a woman’s desire for apples or knowledge. They branded the Crusades
as a land-grabbing, commerce- cornering expedition. They scorned the
Middle Ages as all Dark Ages, and looked down upon the Gothic cathedrals
as barbarous and grotesque. D’Alembert noted about him “a certain
exaltation of ideas,” a “fermenta - tion,” a “general effervescence of
minds,… [which] with a kind of</p>
<p>violence has swept along with it everything that stood in its way.”
70</p>
<p>There was Jacques Andre Naigeon, whom Sainte- Beuve described as “a
fanatical beadle of atheism”; 71 he came to live and work with d’Holbach
as translator and editor; together they published in ten years thirty
books, large o r small, original or imported, all against Christianity;
“it is raining bombs in the house of the Lord,” said Diderot. 72 There
was Nicolas Bou - langer, another friend of d’Holbach, who labored in
the cause till his death (1759), and left behind him a manuscript
entitled Antiquite devoilee ( An- tiquity Unveiled). D’Holbach kept this
in storage till 1765, when the chief minister was Choiseul, friendly to
the philosophes; then he sent? it to the press with a flaming
introduction by Diderot. Religion, said Boulanger,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 693</p>
<p>arose through primitive man’s fears of floods and other apparently
super - natural catastrophes; it was organized by priests and kings in a
conspiracy to sanctify tyranny in return for tyrannical enforcement of
orthodox be- lief; and mankind would never escape from that dark
conspiracy except by following the light of reason in defiance of
priests and kings. 73</p>
<p>More important was Andre Morellet, another Jesuit product, one more
abbe wandering in rebel ranks. Born in 1727, he lived long enough to be
described by Mme. Necker as “a bear” who nevertheless “had candor,
probity, and a thousand good qualities, and enough religion to suspect
that there may be a God, and sometimes to admit it to his friends,
relying on their discretion not to reveal his credulity.” 74 Under
Diderot’s tutelage he wrote some articles for the Encyclopedic. At
d’Holbach’s dinners he dis - played so mordant a wit that Voltaire
called him the Abbe Mord-les — “the Reverend Mr. Bite- Them”; but
Marmontel wrote that he had “profound ideas… and a heart as upright as
it is sound.” 73 In 1762 he pubilshed a Manuel des Inquisiteurs,
composed of selections from the Directorium In- quisitorum of Nicolas
Eymerico, who had zealously served as Grand In- quisitor from 1356 to
1399. Frenchmen had almost forgotten the Spanish Inquisition; Morellet
refreshed their memory by merely quoting the pro- cedures and penalties
of that institution in its heyday. Malesherbes gave Morellet
governmental permission to print the book, for, he said, the penal code
of France was still practically identical with that of the Inquisitors.
76 Morellet could hardly believe it, but in the year that saw his book
go to press Jean Calas was broken on the wheel by the Parlement of
Toulouse.</p>
<p>Of another abbe, Guillaume Raynal, the usually calm Grimm reported in
his Correspondance for 1772: “Since Montesquieu’s Esprit des lois our
literature perhaps has produced no monument that is worthier to pass to
the remotest posterity, and to consecrate the progress of our
enlightenment, than Raynal’s Philosophical and Political History of
European Settlements</p>
<p>694</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Raynal had entered Paris as a poor priest. A legend that reveals the
gay mood of the rebels ascribed his escape from starvation to the fact
that the Abbe Prevost had received twenty sous to say a Mass for a dead
soul; that Prevost had paid the Abbe de Laporte fifteen sous to say it
in his stead; and that Laporte had paid Raynal eight sous to say it in
his stead. 79 Raynal was glad to eat at the tables of Helvetius and
d’Holbach; he proved to be pleasant company, and seems to have secured
the aid of several authors besides Diderot in collecting material, even
in writing sections of his book. Rousseau, who~quarreled with all and
sundry, found Raynal unquarrelable, and thanked him, in the Concessions,
for unswerving friendship and finan- cial aid. 80</p>
<p>Raynal must have made money somehow, for he is said to have bribed
the censor for permission to issue his book. 81 Twenty years of labor
had gone into its preparation. It detailed and denounced the greed,
treachery, and violence of the Europeans in dealing with the natives of
the East and West Indies, and it warned the white man of the terrible
revenge that the colored races might take if ever they came to power. 82
It was the first French indictment of colonial exploitation; it was
among the first books to stress the importance of commerce in
determining modern history; it contributed, in passing, to the
idealization of Indian natives, and to the cult of Chinese civilization
by European liberals. Running through the diffuse volumes were the
dominant themes of the Enlightenment: hatred of super- stition and
priestcraft, and resentment of state-and-Church tyranny over life and
thought. Raynal passionately subscribed to the view that Cathol- icism
was an imposture by which prelates and rulers had joined forces to
support each other through myths, miracles, propaganda, oppression, and
massacre. He appealed to the rulers of Europe to dissociate themselves
from all ecclesiastical ties, to allow freedom of speech and
publication, and to prepare the way for democratic government. He did
not spare Protes- tantism; this too, he said, had been guilty of
intolerance; and he described the fanaticism of the Puritans in New
England, the “witch” persecution in Salem.</p>
<p>Despite its long preparation, Raynal’s boo k was ultimately condemned
to oblivion by its faults. Careless in its facts, it mistook legends for
history, neglected dates, gave no references to authorities, confused
its materials, and engaged (or allowed Diderot to engage) in oratorical
effusions and emotional appeals hardly becoming in a work of history.
But those were no times for calm impartiality; a book was a weapon, and
could not be dulled by presenting opposed sides; literature was war. The
French gov- ernment so assumed; the Parlement of Paris ordered the book
to be burned, and Raynal was ordered to leave France. He fled to the
Netherlands, but thought it safe to return in 1784 under the mildest of
Bourbon kings.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 695</p>
<p>He was one of the few philosophes to see and survive the Revolution.
He was shocked by its violence and its use of all the old machinery of
in- tolerance. On May 31, 1791, aged seventy-eight, he addressed to the
Con- stituent Assembly a letter warning i t against excesses. “I have
long dared to tell kings of their duties,” he wrote; “let me today tell
the people of its errors.” He pointed out that the tyranny of the
populace could be as cruel and unjust as the despotism of monarchs. He
defended the right of the clergy to preach religion, so long as the
opponents of priestcraft were left free to speak their minds; he
protested against the laws enforcing a state religion, and against the
outrages of the mob upon priests. Robespierre persuaded the Assembly to
let the old man escape the guillotine, but Ray- nal’s property was
confiscated by the government, and he died in destitu - tion (1796) amid
the triumphs and terrors of the Revolution.</p>
<p>hi. d’holbach</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Amiable Atheist</li>
</ol>
<p>The best-beloved of all the philosophes in Paris was a German, born
(1723) at Edesheim in the episcopal principality of Speyer. He was bap-
tized as Paul Heinrich Dietrich von Holbach, and was reared as a Roman
Catholic. His grandfather had made a fortune by introducing ipecac from
Holland to Versailles. At Leiden Paul studied science and learned
English. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) he settled in Paris,
became a French subject, married into a family of financiers, and
achieved nobility by investing 1 10,000 livres at five per cent in the
“Company of Secretaries</p>
<p>His home became, as one wit put it, “the Cafe d’Europe”; his dinners
and salon in Paris or at his country villa, Grandval, made him, in
Horace Wal- pole’s phrase, the “maitre d’hotel of philosophy.” On
Thursdays and Sun - days Mme. d ’Holbach prepared the table for twelve
guests, not always the same, but most frequently the leaders of the
anti-Christian war: Diderot, Helvetius, d’Alembert, Raynal, Boulanger,
Morellet, Saint -Lambert, Mar- montel; sometimes Buffon, Turgot, and
Quesnay. Rousseau came, too, but shuddered at the atheism bubbling
around him. There Diderot was at his</p>
<p>696 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>wildest, and the Abbe Galiani kept philosophy on the ground by
punctur- ing theory with wit. The “Synagogue,” as the Baron called these
gatherings, met at two o’clock, talked, ate, and talked till seven or
eight; those were the days when conversation was unwritten literature,
not a chaos of in- terruptions and trivialities. No topics were barred
there; “that was the - tive conversation that ever was… in regard to
philosophy, religion, and government; light pleasantries had no place
there…. It was there, above all, that Diderot lighted our minds and
warmed our souls.” 84 Diderot him - self reported to Mile. Volland that
they talked “of art, poetry, the phi - losophy of love,… the sentiment
of immortality, of men, gods, and kings, of space and time, of dea th
and life.” 85 “Sometimes,” said Marmontel, “I thought I heard the
disciples of Pythagoras or Plato.” 86 Or,</p>
<p>when the fine weather came, we sometimes exchanged these dinners for
philosophical walks… along the banks of the Seine; the repast</p>
<p>on those days was a large dinner of fish; and we went by turns to the
places most celebrated for the supply of that article, commonly to St.-
Cloud. We went down early in a boat, breathing the air of the river,</p>
<p>and we returned in the evening through the Bois de Boulogne. 87</p>
<p>D’Holbach’s salon became so famous that foreigners visiting Paris
pulled wires to get an invitation. So, at divers times, came Hume,
Sterne, Garrick, Horace Walpole, Franklin, Priestley, Adam Smith,
Beccaria. They were somewhat disturbed by the number of atheists they
found there; how many times have we heard the story (told by Diderot to
Romilly) that when Hume doubted the actual existence of atheists, the
Baron assured him, “Here you are at table with seventeen.” 88 Gibbon re
lated that the phi- losophes of Paris “laughed at the cautious
skepticism of Hume, preached</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 697</p>
<p>It would give you great satisfaction to find that there is not a
single deist among them.” 92 The evidence is rather confusing.</p>
<p>But all agreed that the Baron and his wife were perfect hosts and
lovable characters. Mme. d’Holbach, according to Grimm, lived only for
her hus - band; once she had welcomed and nourished his guests, she
retired to a corner with her knitting and took no further part in the
conversation. 03 She died in 1754, in the prime of her life; for a time
d’Holbach remained “in a state of utter despair.” 94 Two years later he
married her sister, who proved equally devoted. He was so unassuming in
his manners, so amiable in argu- ment, so secret in his beneficence, 95
that hardly anyone suspected him of writing so powerful a defense of
atheism as the Systeme de la nature. “I never saw a man more simply
simple,” said his salonniere rival, Mme. Geoff rin. 06 Rousseau, who
learned to hate nearly all the philosophes, retained such admiration for
d’Holbach’s character that he used him as a model for the virtuous
agnostic Wolmar in La Nouvelle Helo’ise. Grimm, who analyzed everyone
but Rousseau with calm objectivity, wrote:</p>
<p>It was natural for Baron d’Holbach to believe in the empire of rea
-</p>
<p>son, for his passions (and we always judge others by ourselves) were
such as in all cases to give the ascendancy to virtue and correct</p>
<p>principles. It was impossible for him to hate anyone; yet he
could</p>
<p>not, without an effort, dissemble his professed horror of priests….
Whenever he spoke of these his naturally good temper forsook him. 07</p>
<p>So d’Holbach warmly supported the Encyclopedic, contributed money and
articles to it, and gave Diderot comfort and courage when even
d’Alembert and Voltaire were deserting the enterprise. His articles
were</p>
<p>Fascinated by science, and expecting from it a rapid betterment
of</p>
<p>human life, d’Holbach looked with unrelenting hostility upon the
Church, whose control of education seemed to bar the way to the
development of scientific knowledge. He lost no chance of attacking the
clergy. He wrote the articles “Pretres” and “Theocratie” for the
Encyclopedic. From 1766 onward he organized with Naigeon a veritable
factory of anti-Christian literature. In quick succession appeared Le
Tableau des saints, De P Im- posture sacerdotale, Pretres demasques, De
la Cruaute religieuse, UEnfer detruit; here was a new apostle of glad
tidings — hell had been destroyed.</p>
<p>698</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>In 1761 there issued from what some called “this laboratory of
atheism” a volume entitled Christianisme devoile ( Christianity Exposed
), written chiefly by d’Holbach but ascribed on the title page to “the
late M. Bou - langer.” For selling this book a peddler was branded and
sent to the galleys for five years; for buying and reselling it a boy
was branded and sent to the galleys for nine years.“ It was a frontal
assault upon the alliance of Church and state, and qu ite anticipated
Marx’s description of religion as the “opium of the people.”</p>
<p>Religion is the art of intoxicating men with enthusiasm [this
word</p>
<p>in the eighteenth century meant religious fervor], to prevent
them</p>
<p>from dealing with the evils with which their governors oppress them….
The art of reigning has become nothing more than that of profit- ing
from the errors and abjection of mind and soul into which super- stition
has plunged the nations…. By means of threatening men</p>
<p>with invisible powers, they [Church and state] force them to
suffer</p>
<p>in silence the miseries with which visible powers afflict them.
They</p>
<p>are made to hope that if they agree to being unhappy in this
world,</p>
<p>hey will be happy in the next. 100</p>
<p>D’Holbach thought this union of Church and state the fundamental evil
in France. “It is as a citizen that I attack religion, because it seems
to me harm - ful to the happiness of the state, hostile to the mind of
man, and contrary to sound morality.” 101</p>
<p>Instead of morality the Christian is taught the miraculous fables</p>
<p>and inconceivable dogmas of a religion thoroughly hostile to
right</p>
<p>reason. From his very first step in his studies he is taught to
distrust the evidence of his senses, to subdue his reason,… and to
rely</p>
<p>blindly on the authority of his master…. Those who have shaken</p>
<p>hemselves free from these notions find themselves powerless against
errors sucked in with their mother’s milk. 102</p>
<p>To rest morality upon religious beliefs, d’Holbach ar gued, is a
risky pro- cedure, for such beliefs are subject to change, and their
fall may damage the moral code allied with them.</p>
<p>Everyone who has discovered the weakness or falsity of the evidence
upon which his religion is based… will be tempted to believe that</p>
<p>he morality is as chimerical as the religion it is founded on…. That
is how it is that the words infidel and libertine have become synony-
mous. There would be no such disadvantage if a natural morality</p>
<p>were taught instead of a theological. Instead of prohibiting debauch-
ery, crime, and vice because God and religion forbid them, we ought</p>

<p>o say that all excess is harmful to man’s conservation, makes him</p>
<p>despicable in the eyes of society, is forbidden by reason,… and</p>
<p>is forbidden by nature, which wants him to work for his lasting</p>
<p>happiness. 103</p>
<p>It is hard to understand how a man so burdened with money should have
found time or urge to write so many books. In 1767 he sent forth a Theo-
logie portative earnestly making fun of Christian doctrines and reducing
all theology to the ecclesiastical will to power. In 1768 he published
La Con- tagion sacree, ou histoire naturelle de la superstition,
ostensibly translated “from the English of Jean Trenchard”; and in the
same year he issued Lettres d Eugenie, ou preservatif contre les
prejuges, which pretended to be by an Epicurean philosopher in Sceaux.
In 1769 came an Essai sur les prejuges, par M. du Marsais, explaining
that the only cure for the evils of religion was the spread of education
and philosophy. And in 1770 the busy Baron published his chef- d’oeuvre,
the most powerful single volume issued in the campaign against
Christianity.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The System of Nature</li>
</ol>
<p>Systeme de la nature, ou des lois du monde physique et du monde moral
was printed professedly in London, actually in Amsterdam, in two large
volumes, and bore, as the name of the author, “M. Mirabaud.” This man,
now ten years dead, had been secretary to the French Academy. An intro-
duction gave a sketch of his life and works. No one believed that the
good and exemplary Mirabaud had written so scandalous a book.</p>
<p>The quadrennial Assembly of the Clergy (1770), after voting a
grant</p>
<p>of money to the King, appealed to him to suppress the anti-Christian
liter- ature that was circulating in France. Louis XV ordered his
prosecutor to act at once. The Parlement of Paris condemned seven books,
among them d’Holbach’s Christianisme devoile and the Systeme de la
nature, as “im - pious, blasphemous, and seditious, tending to destroy
all idea of divinity, to rouse the people to revolt against religion and
government, to overthrow all the principles of public security and
morality, and to turn subjects away from obedience to their sovereign.”
The books were to be burned, the authors were to be arrested and
severely punished. Morellet tells us that ten men knew that d’Holbach
was the author, and that they kept the secret for twenty years. The
“Synagogue” continued its meetings, and to some of them Mme. d’Holbach
invited Canon Bergier, who had just received a pension from the clergy
for his scholarly articles defending the Cath- olic Church. Many
suspected Diderot of having written parts of the book. It was, as a
whole, too orderly and solemn to have come from his pen, but</p>
<p>700</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>he may have contributed the flowery apostrophe to Nature at the end.
In any case, Diderot felt unsafe in Paris, and thought it wise to visit
Langres.</p>
<p>The Systeme , smuggled in from Holland, was bought eagerly by a wide
public, including, says Voltaire, “scholars, the ignorant, and women.”
104 Diderot was deli ghted with it. “What I like,” he said, “is a
philosophy clear, definite, and frank, such as you have in the System of
Nature. The author is not an atheist on one page and a deist on another.
His philosophy is all of one piece” 105 — quite unlike Didero t’s. What
he really liked was that d’Holbach was an atheist on every page. And yet
the book was infused with an almost religious devotion to the happiness
of mankind. D’Holbach, seeing so much misery in a world ruled by kings
and priests, concluded that men would be happier if they turned their
backs upon priests and kings, and followed scientists and philosophers.
The opening sentences of the book announce its spirit and theme:</p>
<p>The source of man’s unhappiness is his ignorance of nature. The</p>
<p>pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his
in-</p>
<p>fancy,… [and] the consequent prejudice that warps his mind,…</p>
<p>appear to doom him to continual error…. He takes the tone of his</p>
<p>ideas on the authority of others, who are themselves in error, or who
have an interest in deceiving him. To remove this Cimmerian
darkness,</p>
<p>… to guide him out of this Cretan labyrinth, requires the clue of</p>
<p>Ariadne, with all the love she could bestow on Theseus…. It
exacts</p>
<p>a most undaunted courage,… a persevering resolution….</p>
<p>The most important of our duties, then, is to seek means by which</p>
<p>we may destroy delusions that can never do more than mislead us. The
remedies for these evils must be sought in Nature herself. It is only in
the abundance of her resources that we can rationally expect to find
antidotes to the mischief brought upon us by an ill-directed, an over-
powering enthusiasm. It is time these remedies were sought; it is time
to look the evil boldly in the face, to examine its foundations, to
scruti- nize its superstructure. Reason, with its faithful guide
experience, must attack in their entrenchments those prejudices of which
the human race has been too long the victim….</p>
<p>Let us try to inspire man with courage, with respect for his
reason,</p>
<p>with an inextinguishable love for truth, to the end that he may learn
to consult his experience, and no longer be the dupe of an imagination
led astray by authority;… that he may learn to found his morals on his
nature, on his wants, on the real advantage of society; that he may dare
to love himself; that he may become a virtuous and rational being, in
which case he cannot fail to be happy. 106</p>
<p>Having so stated his program, d’Holbach proceeds systematical ly to
reject all supernatural beings and considerations; to accept nature with
all</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>701</p>
<p>its beauty, cruelty, limitation, and possibilities; to reduce all
reality to matter and motion; and to build upon this materialistic basis
a system of morality which he hopes would be capable of transforming
savages into citizens, of forming individual character and social order,
and of giving a reasonable happiness even to a life inevitably destined
to death.</p>
<p>He begins and ends with nature, but he disclaims any attempt to per-
sonify it; he defines it as “the great whole that results from the
assemblage of matter under its various combinations”; it is d’Holbach’s
affectionate name for the universe. Matter he defines cautiously as “in
general all that affects our senses in any fashion whatever.”</p>
<p>Everything in the universe is in motion; the essence of matter is
to</p>
<p>act; if we consider it attentively, we shall discover that no
particle of it enjoys absolute repose…. All that appears to us to be at
rest does not remain even for one instant in the same state. All beings
are con- tinually breeding, increasing, decreasing, and dispersing….
The</p>
<p>hardest stones, by degrees, give way to the touch of air. 107</p>
<p>The whole offers to our contemplation “nothing but an immense, unin -
terrupted succession of causes and effects.” 108 The more our knowledge
grows, the more overwhelming is the evidence that the universe acts only
through natural causes. It may be difficult to understand how “inanimate
matter can pass into life,” but it is even more difficult to believe
that life is a special creation of some mysterious entity external to
the material uni- verse. It is difficult to understand how matter can
come to feel, but other properties of matter, like “gravity, magnetism,
elasticity, electricity,” are</p>
<p>Man too is “a being purely physical,” subject to the same laws
that</p>
<p>govern the rest of the world. How could a physical body and an
immaterial mind act upon each other? The “soul” is merely the total
organization and activity of the body, and can have no separate
existence. “To say that the soul will feel, think, enjoy, and suffer
after the death of the body is to pretend that a clock shivered into a
thousand pieces will continue to strike the hour… and mark the progress
of time.” 110 The conception of mind and soul as immaterial entities has
retarded our treatment of mental diseases; when we consider mind as a
function of the body we enable medical science to cure many mental
disorders by attacking their physical</p>
<p>causes.* 111</p>
<p>“It is certainly true as a historical fact,” said John Morley, “that
the rational treatment of insane persons, and the rational view of
certain kinds of crime, were due to men like Pinel, trained in the
materialistic school of the eighteenth century. And it was clearly
impossible that the great and humane reforms in this field could have
taken place before the decisive decay of theology” 1: 12</p>
<p>702 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Being a function of the body, mind is subject to the universal rule
of natural causes and effects. Chapter XI of the Systeme is the most
eloquent defense of determinism in all the range of French
philosophy:</p>
<p>Man’s life is a line that nature commands him to describe upon
the</p>
<p>surface of the earth, without his being able to swerve from it even
for an instant. He is born without his consent; his organization in no
wise depends upon himself; his ideas come to him involuntarily; his
habits are in the power of those who cause him to contract them. He is
un- ceasingly modified by causes, visible or concealed, over which he
has no control, which necessarily regulate his mode of existence, give
a</p>
<p>color to his thinking, and determine his manner of acting. He is good
or bad, happy or miserable, wise or foolish, reasonable or irrational,
with- out his will counting for anything in these various states.
113</p>
<p>This determinism seems to imply fatalism, and d’Holbach, unlike most
determinists, frankly accepts the implication. The condition of the uni-
verse at any moment is determined by its condition at the preceding
moment, and this was determined by its predecessor, and so on as far in
the past as you like, so that any moment in the history of the universe
may be taken as determining all later moments, as far in the future as
you like. This apparent subjection of man — of every genius or saint in
every conception or prayer — to some primeval gas does not deter
d’Holbach; he accepts his fate with stoic pride:</p>
<p>Man is the work of Nature; he exists in Nature; he is submitted
to</p>
<p>her laws. He cannot deliver himself from them, nor can he step beyond
them, even in thought…. Instead, therefore, of seeking outside the
world…. for beings who can procure him a happiness denied him</p>
<p>by Nature, let man study this Nature, let him learn her laws, contem-
plate her forces, observe the immutable xules by which she acts; let him
apply these discoveries to his own felicity, and submit in silence to
her mandates, which nothing can alter; let him cheerfully consent to
ignore causes hidden from him by an impenetrable veil; let him</p>
<p>without murmuring yield to the decrees of a universal necessity which
can never be brought within his comprehension, nor ever emancipate him
from those laws that are imposed upon him by his essence. 114</p>
<p>Does this fatalism warrant us in concluding that there is no use in
our trying to avoid evil, dishonor, sickness, or death, and that we may
as well cease all effort, all ambition or aspiration, and let events
take their course? D’Holbach replies that even here we have no choice:
heredity and environ - ment have already determined whether we shall
subside into apathy or respond actively to the needs and challenges of
life. And he anticipates the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>703</p>
<p>objection that determinism, by appearing to excuse crime, may
increase it. Determinism does not suggest that crime should not be
punished; on the contrary it will lead the legislator, the teacher, and
public opinion to pro- vide, by laws or morals, better deterrents to
crime and more inducements to social behavior; these deterrents and
inducements will enter into the environmental factors molding the
conduct of men. But determinism does warrant us in considering crime,
and all unsocial behavior, as a mental im- balance due to heredity,
environment, or circumstance; therefore we must deal with such behavior
as we treat disease; we must abandon the use of torture and extreme
penalties, for these increase the opposition between the individual and
society, and accustom people to violence and cruelty rather than deter
them from crime.</p>
<p>In this philosophy, of course, there is no room for God.
D’Holbach’s</p>
<p>unflagging antipathy, not only to theism but to deism and pantheism
as well, led his contemporaries to call him “the personal enemy of the
Al - mighty.” 115 “If we go back to the beginning we can always find
that ignorance and fear have created gods; fancy, enthusiasm, or deceit
has adorned or disfigured them; weakness worships them, credulity keeps
them alive, custom respects them, tyranny supports them to… serve its
own ends.” 116 He raises against theism all the old arguments, and grows
as ho t as Helvetius against the Biblical conception of God. 117 The
majestic order and regularity of the universe do not suggest to him any
supreme intelli- gence; they are due to natural causes operating
mechanically, and require no attribution to a deity who would himself be
more inexplicable than the world. Order and disorder, like good and
evil, beauty and ugliness, are subjective conceptions, derived from the
pleasure or displeasure that our perceptions give us; but man is not
“the measure of all things”; his satis - factions are no objective
standard to apply to the universe; Nature pro- ceeds without regard to
what we, from our infinitesimal point in space, con- sider good or bad,
ugly or beautiful. From the point of view of the whole “there is no such
thing as real evil. Insects find a safe retreat in the ruins of the
palace that crushes men in its fall.” 118 We must learn to regard
Nature, with her sublimities and catastrophes, as imperturbably
neutral.</p>
<p>All that has been said in the course of this work proves clearly
that</p>
<p>everything is necessarv, that everything is always in order relative
to Nature, where all beings do nothing more than follow the laws
that</p>
<p>are imposed on their respective classes…. Nature distributes with</p>
<p>he same hand that which is called order and that which is called dis-
order, that which is called pleasure and that which is called pain;
in</p>
<p>short she diffuses, by the necessity of her existence, both evil and
good.</p>
<p>… Let not man, therefore, either praise her bounty or tax her
with</p>
<p>malice; let him not imagine that his vociferations or supplications
can</p>
<p>704 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>ever arrest her colossal power, always acting after immutable
laws.</p>
<p>… When he suffers let him not seek a remedy by recurring to</p>
<p>chimeras that his own distempered imagination has created; let him
draw from the stores of Nature the remedies which she offers for the
evils she brings upon him; let him search in her bosom for those salu-
tary productions to which she has given birth. 119</p>
<p>D’Holbach comes close to reintroducing God in the form of Nature.</p>
<p>After vowing not to personify it he tends to deify her, speaks of her
omnip- otence, her will, her plan, her bounty ; he thinks of her as
man’s best guide, and lets Diderot (?) write a sophomoric apostrophe to
her as the conclud- ing paragraph of a powerful book: “O Nature,
sovereign of all beings! and ye, her adorable daughters, Virtue, Reason,
and Truth, remain forever our only divinities! It is to you that belong
the praises of the human race; to you appertains the homage of the
earth,” and so on. Such pantheistic piety is hardly in key with
d’Holbach’s view of nature as handing out good and evil impartially: “
Winds, tempests, hurricanes, volcanoes, wars, plagues, famine, diseases,
death are as necessary to her eternal march as the [not everywhere!]
beneficent heat of the sun.” 120 We are reminded of Calvin’s God, stingy
with heaven and lavish of hell.</p>
<p>In his characteristic mood d’Holbach repudiates not only the idea of
God but the very word. “The words God and create… ought to be</p>
<p>banished from the language of all those who desire to speak to be
under- stood. These are abstract words, invented by ignorance; they are
only calculated to satisfy men lacking in experience, men too idle or
too timid to study nature and its ways.” 121 He rejects deism as a
compromise with super - stition , 122 and makes a veritable religion of
atheism:</p>
<p>The friend of mankind cannot be a friend of God, who at all times</p>
<p>has been a real scourge to the earth. The apostle of nature will not
be the instrument of deceitful chimeras, by which the world is made an
abode of illusions; the adorer of truth will not compromise with false-
hood…. He knows that the happiness of the human race im-</p>
<p>periously exacts that the dark, unsteady edifice of superstition
shall be razed to its foundations, in order to elevate on its ruins a
temple to</p>
<p>nature suitable to peace — a fane sacred to virtue…. If his
efforts</p>
<p>should be in vain; if he cannot inspire with courage beings too much
accustomed to tremble, he will at least applaud himself for having</p>
<p>dared the attempt. Nevertheless he will not judge his efforts
fruitless if he has been able to make only a single mortal happy, if his
principles have calmed the transports of one honest mind…. At least he
will</p>
<p>have the advantage of having banished from his own mind the im-</p>
<p>portunate terror of superstition,… of having trodden underfoot</p>
<p>hose chimeras with which the unfortunate are tormented. Thus,</p>

<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>705</p>
<p>escaped from the peril of the storm, he will calmly contemplate, from
the summit of his rock, those tremendous hurricanes which supersti- tion
excites; and he will hold forth a succoring hand to those who</p>
<p>shall be willing to accept it. 123</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Morals and the State</li>
</ol>
<p>But is atheism compatible with popular morality? Can the powerful</p>
<p>egoistic impulses of common men be controlled by a moral code shorn
of all religious devotion and support? D’Holbach faced this question in
the Systeme de la nature , and returned to it in 1776 with a
three-volume Morale universelle. First of all, he doubts if religion,
all in all, has made for morality:</p>
<p>In spite of a hell so horrid even in description, what crowds of</p>
<p>abandoned criminals fill our cities!… Are condemned thieves and</p>
<p>murderers either atheists or skeptics? Those wretches believe in a
God… Does the most religious father, in advising his son, speak to him
of a vindictive God?… His constitution destroyed by debauchery, his</p>
<p>fortune ruined by gambling, the contempt of society — these are the
motives that the father employs. 124</p>
<p>And even supposing that religion sometimes helps morality, does this
bal- ance the harm that religion causes?</p>
<p>Against one timid man whom this idea [of hell] restrains, there
are</p>
<p>housands upon whom it operates to no effect; there are millions whom
it makes irrational, whom it turns into savage persecutors, whom it</p>
<p>converts into wicked… fanatics; there are millions whose minds</p>
<p>it disturbs, and whom it diverts from their duty to society. 125</p>
<p>And consider the hypocrisy forced upon skeptics by the social
pressure of religion:</p>
<p>Those who wish to form an idea of the shackles imposed by</p>
<p>heology upon the genius of philosophers born under the “Christian Dis
- pensation,” let the m read the metaphysical romances of Leibniz,</p>
<p>Descartes, Malebranche, Cudworth, etc., and coolly examine the in-
genious but rhapsodical systems entitled “the pre - established harmony”
of “occasional causes.” 126</p>
<p>Adoreover, by concentrating human thought upon individual salvation
in another world, Christianity deadened civic feeling in this one,
leaving men</p>
<p>70 6 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>insensitive to the misery of their fellows, and to the injustices
committed by oppressive groups and governments.</p>
<p>D’Holbach rejects the Christian - Voltairean idea that man is born
with a sense of right and wrong. Conscience is the voice not of God but
of the policeman; it is the deposit of a thousand exhortations,
commands, and reproofs falling upon the individual in his growth. “We
may define con - science as our knowledge of the effects which our
actions produce upon our fellow men, and, in reaction, upon ourselves.”
127 Such conscience can be a false guide, for it may have been formed by
a slanted education, by misunderstood experience, by erroneous
reasoning, or by a corrupt public opinion. There is no vice or crime
that cannot be made to seem a virtue by indoctrination or evil example;
so adultery, however forbidden by re- ligion, has become a proud
achievement, sycophancy is de rigueur at court, rape and rapine, among
soldiers, are considered legitimate rewards of risk- ing life and limb.
“We see rich men who suffer no pricks of conscience over wealth acquired
at the expense of their fellow citizens,” and “zealots whose conscience,
blinded by false ideas,… urges them to exterminate without remorse those
who have different opinions than their own.” The best that we can hope
for is a conscience formed by a better education, by an acquired habit
of looking forward to the effects of our actions upon others and
ourselves, and by a healthier public opinion which an intelligent
individual will hesitate to offend. 128</p>
<p>D’Holbach agrees with Christianity that man is by nature inclined to
“sin”— i.e., to behavior injurious to the group; but he rejects as
ridiculous the notion that this “sinful nature” is an inheritance from
the “sin of our first parents.” He accepts ego ism as fundamental in
human conduct, and, like Helvetius, he proposes to found his moral code
upon it by making social behavior advantageous to the individual.
“Morals would be a vain science if it did not incontestably prove to man
that his interest consists in being virtuous.” 129 Something can be
achieved by an education that ex - plains the dependence of individual
welfare upon the welfare of the group, and a considerable degree of
“altruism” can be evoked by appealing to the</p>
<p>Live for yourself and your fellow creature. I [Nature] approve of</p>
<p>your pleasures while they injure neither you nor others, whom I have
rendered necessary to your happiness…. Be just, since justice sup-</p>
<p>ports the human race. Be good, since your goodness will attract every
heart to you. Be indulgent, since you live among beings weak like your-
self. Be modest, as your pride will hurt the self-love of everyone
around you. Pardon injuries, do good to him who injures you, that you
may</p>
<p>… gain his friendship. Be moderate, temperate, and chaste, since</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>707</p>
<p>lechery, intemperance, and excess will destroy you and make you con-
temptible. 130</p>
<p>If government cared more actively for the health, protection, and
educa- tion of the people, there would be far less crime; 131 when one
has much to lose he does not readily risk it in unsocial conduct. If
education trained pupils to reason, instead of frightening them with
irrational beliefs that soon lose their force, men would be morally
improved by increased ability to apply experience to action, foreseeing,
in the light of the past, the future effects of present deeds. In the
long run intelligence is the highest virtue, and such virtue is the best
road to happiness.</p>
<p>In Systeme de la nature, Systeme social (1772, three volumes),
Politique naturelle (1772, two volumes), and Bthocratie (1776) the
indefatigable millionaire took up the problems of society and
government. In these books the attack passes from the Church to the
state. D’Holbach agrees with Locke and Marx that labor is the source of
all wealth, but, like Locke, he justifies private property as the right
of a man to the product of his labor. Himself a noble, he would do away
with hereditary aristocracy:</p>
<p>A body of men that can lay claim to wealth and honor solely though
the title of birth must of necessity serve as a discouragement to the
other classes of citizens. Those who have only ancestors have no right
to reward…. Hereditary nobility can only be regarded as a perni-</p>
<p>cious abuse, fit only for favoring the indolence… and incompetence of
one class to the detriment of all. 132… Old title deeds, ancient</p>
<p>documents, preserved in medieval castles — are they to confer upon
their inheritors a claim to the most exalted posts in Church and state,
in the courts of justice, or in the army, regardless of whether
these</p>
<p>inheritors possess the talents necessary for the proper
accomplishment of such duties? 133</p>
<p>As for the clergy, let them shift for themselves. Church and state
should be strictly separate; religious groups should be treated as
voluntary associ- ations, enjoying toleration but no state support; and
a wise government will prevent any one religion from intolerance or
persecution. 134</p>
<p>Himself a rentier, d ’Holbach criticizes the idle rentiers of the
middle class, and he has a baron’s scorn of businessmen. “There is no
more danger - ous creature alive then the businessman seeking his prey.”
136 The greed of commerce is now replacing dynastic ambitions as a cause
of war:</p>
<p>States are ready to cut each other’s throats [for] some heaps of</p>
<p>sand. Entire nations become the dupes of avaricious businessmen, who
beguile them with the hope of wealth, the fruit of which they gather</p>
<p>708</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>only for themselves. Countries are depopulated, taxation is piled up,
peoples are impoverished, to satisfy the greed of a small group.</p>
<p>He strikes a passing blow at Britain, which had just taken India and
Canada:</p>
<p>There is one people who in the transports of their greed seem to</p>
<p>have formed the extravagant project of usurping the commerce of the
world and making themselves owners of the seas — an iniquitous and mad
project whose execution… would hastily bring to certain ruin the nation
that is guided by this frenzy…. The day will come when</p>
<p>Indians, having learned the art of war from Europeans, will hurl them
from their shores. 136</p>
<p>D’Holbach is inclined to the physiocratic gospel of laissez
-faire:</p>
<p>The government should do nothing for the merchant except to leave him
alone. No regulations can guide him in his enterprises so well as his
own interest…. The state owes commerce nothing but protec-</p>
<p>ion. Among commercial nations those that allow their subjects the</p>
<p>most unlimited liberty may be sure of soon excelling all others.
137</p>
<p>But then, too, he advises governments to prevent a dangerous
concentra- tion of wealth. He quotes with relish St. Jerome’s swift
barb, “ Dives aut iniquus est , aut iniqui haeres ” (The rich man is
either a scoundrel or a scoundrel’s heir) , 138</p>
<p>In almost all nations three quarters of the subjects possess
nothing.</p>
<p>… When a small number of men absorb all the property and wealth in a
state, they become the masters of that state…. Governments</p>
<p>seem to have altogether neglected this important truth. 139… When the
public will or law ceases to keep the balance even between the</p>
<p>different members of society, the laziness of some, aided by
force,</p>
<p>fraud, and seduction, succeeds in appropriating the fruit of the
labor of others. 140</p>
<p>Nearly all kings, in d’Holbach’s opinion, ally themselves with the
clever minority in exploiting the majority. He seems to be thinking of
Louis XV.</p>
<p>On the face of this globe we see only unjust sovereigns,
enervated</p>
<p>by luxury, corrupted by flattery, depraved by licentiousness,
made</p>
<p>wicked by impurity, devoid of talents, without morals,… and in-</p>
<p>capable of exerting an energy for the benefit of the states they
govern. They are consequently but little occupied with the welfare of
their</p>
<p>people, and indifferent to their duties, of which, indeed, they are
often</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>709</p>
<p>ignorant. Stimulated by the desire… to feed their insatiable
ambi-</p>
<p>ion, they engage in useless, depopulating wars, and never occupy
their minds with those objects which are the most important to the
happi- ness of their nation. 141</p>
<p>Obviously thin king of the French government, d’Holbach lashes out at
the farming of tax collections to private financiers:</p>
<p>The despot addresses himself to a class of citizens who furnish
him</p>
<p>with the means for his avidity in exchange for the right to extort
with impunity from all others…. In his blindness he does not see
that</p>
<p>he taxes on his subjects are often doubled; that the sums that go to
enrich the extortioners are lost to himself; and that the army of subor-
dinate publicani is subsidized at a pure loss, to make war on the
nation.</p>
<p>… These brigands, grown rich, arouse the jealousy of the nobility</p>
<p>and the envy of their fellow citizens…. Wealth becomes the one and
only motive,… the thirst for gold lays hold of every heart. 142</p>
<p>At times the comfortable aristocrat talks like the angriest of
unplaced youths: “Are nations to work without respite to satisfy the
vanity, the luxury, the greed of a pack of useless and corrupt
bloodsuckers ?” 143 In this mood he echoes the Contrat Social of his
former friend Rousseau:</p>
<p>Man is wicked not because he is born so but because he is rendered
so. The great and powerful crush with impunity the indigent and un-
happy. These, at the risk of their lives, seek to retaliate the evil
they have received; they attack either openly or secretly a country that
to them is a stepmother, who gives all to some of her children, and de-
prives the others of everything….</p>
<p>Man is almost everywhere a slave. It follows of necessity that he
is</p>
<p>base, selfish, dissimulating, without honor; in a word, that he has
the vices of the state of which he is a member. Everywhere he is
deceived, encouraged in ignorance, and prevented from using his reason;
of</p>
<p>course he must everywhere be stupid, irrational, and wicked; every-
where he sees vice and crime applauded and honored; he concludes that
vice is good, and that virtue is only a useless self-sacrifice….</p>
<p>If governments were enlightened, and seriously occupied themselves
with the instruction and welfare of the people, and if laws were equi-
table,… it would not be necessary to seek in another life for fi-</p>
<p>nancial chimeras which always prove abortive against the
infuriate</p>
<p>passions and real wants of man. 144</p>
<p>How can this exploitation be stopped? The first step is to abolish
abso- lute monarchy. “Absolute power must necessarily corrupt in heart
and</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>mind whoever holds it. 145… The power of the king should always be
subordinate to the representatives of the people; and these
representatives should depend continuously on the will of their
constituents”; 140 here is a call for the summoning of the fateful
States-General of 1789. Since every government derives its powers from
the consent of the governed, “the society may at any time revoke these
powers if the government ceases to represent the general will”; 147 here
is the voice of Rousseau and revolution.</p>
<p>But revolutions, sometimes at great cost, destroy the past in order
to rebuild it under another phrase and form.</p>
<p>Not through dangerous convulsions, not through conflict,
regicide,</p>
<p>and useless crimes, can the wounds of the nation be healed. These</p>
<p>violent remedies are always more cruel than the evils they are
intended to cure…. The voice of reason is neither seditious nor
bloodthirsty.</p>
<p>The reforms which it proposes may be slow, but therefore all the</p>
<p>better planned. 148</p>
<p>Men are imperfect, and cannot make perfect states; utopias are
chimeras “incompatible with the nature of a being whose feeble machine
is subject to derangement, and whose ardent imagination will not always
submit to the guidance of reason…. The perfecting of politics can only
be the slow fruit of the experience of centuries.” 149 Progress is not a
straight line, and it is a long one; many generations of education and
experiment will be needed to clarify the causes and cures of social
ills. Democracy is an ideal, possible only in small states and with
widespread popular intelligence; it would be unwise in the France of
Louis XVI. Perhaps this new king, so good and well-intentioned, will
engage great talents to reform the state. So, in the end, d’Holbach
contents himself with a constitutional monarchy, and he dedicates his
Ethocratie to Louis as “a just, human, beneficent king,… father of his
people, protector of the poor.” 150 In that desperate hope the aging
philosophe hung up his arms.</p>

<li>D’Holbach and His Critics</li>
</ol>
<p>The Systeme de la nature is the most thorough and forthright
exposition of materialism and atheism in all the history of philosophy.
The endless hesitations, contradictions, and subtleties of Voltaire, the
vague enthusiasms and ambivalent lucubrations of Diderot, the confusing
repudiations of Rousseau by Jean Jacques, are here replaced by a careful
consistency of ideas, and a forceful expression in a style sometimes
heavy, occasionally flowery, often eloquent, always direct and clear.
Yet, realizing that seven hundred such pages would be too much for the
general digestion, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>71 1</p>
<p>anxious to reach a wider audience, d’Holbach expounded his views
again, in a simpler forum, in he Bon Sens, ou idees oppose es aux idees
sumatu- relles (1772). Seldom has a writer been so assiduous in
spreading such un- popular convictions.</p>
<p>That he was heard far and wide is proved by the reaction of Frederick
the Great to the Systeme de la nature. He who had so courted the philos-
ophies, and had been lauded as their patron and ideal, turned against
them when he saw one of their leaders attacking absolute monarchy as
well as Christianity. It had been to his advantage to have the Catholic
powers weakened in their internal unity by the campaign against the
Church; but to find that rebel ecstasy daring now to insult kings as
well as God stirred him to resentment, perhaps to fear. The same pen
that had once written Anti-Machiavel now composed a Refutation du
Systeme de la nature. This man d’Holbach was going too far and too fast.
“When one speaks in pub - lic,” Frederick suggested, “he should consider
the delicacy of superstitious ears; he should not shock anybody; he
should wait till the time is suf- ficiently enlightened to let him think
out loud.” 1511</p>
<p>Apparently at Frederick’s suggestion, but probably still more through
fear that the extreme radicalism of d’Holbach would alienate all but
atheists and revolutionaries from the philosophic camp, V oltaire, like
a general re- proving a presumptuous lieutenant, inserted into the
article “Dieu” in his Dictionnaire philosophique several pages
criticizing d’Holbach’s chef - d’oeuvre. He began:</p>
<p>The author has had the advantage of being read by both learned and
ignorant, and by women. His style, then, has merits which that of</p>
<p>Spinoza lacked. He is often luminous, sometimes eloquent, although,
like all the rest, he may be charged with repetitions, declamations, and
self-contradictions. But as regards profundity he is very often to
be</p>
<p>distrusted both in physics and in morals. The interest of mankind
is</p>
<p>here involved; we will therefore examine whether his doctrine is true
and useful.</p>
<p>Voltaire would not agree that the order which we ascribe to the uni-
verse, and the disorder which we may think to find in it, are subjective
concepts and prejudices; he argued that the order is overwhelmingly ob-
vious, and that disorder is sometimes painfully clear.</p>
<p>What, is not a child born blind or without legs, or a monstrous</p>
<p>freak, contrary to the nature of the species? Is it not the
ordinary</p>
<p>regularity of nature that makes order, and the irregularity that
con-</p>
<p>stitutes disorder? Is it not a great derangement, a dreadful
disorder, when nature gives a child hunger and a closed esophagus?
Evacuations</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>of every kind are necessary, yet the excretory channels are
frequently without openings, which it is necessary to remedy…. The
origin</p>
<p>of the disorder remains to be discovered, but the disorder is
real.</p>
<p>As to matter having the power to generate life and mind,
Voltaire,</p>
<p>hough he too had once inclined to that view, preferred a modest
agnosti- cism to d’Holbach’s confident assumptions:</p>
<p>“Experience [he quotes from the Systandandandandne] proves to us that
the</p>
<p>matter which we regard as inert and dead assumes action, life, and
in- telligence when it is combined in a certain way.” But this is
precisely the difficulty. How does a living germ arise? About this the
author and the reader are alike ignorant. Hence, are not the Syste?n of
Nature, and all the [philosophical] systems in the world, so many
dreams?</p>
<p>“It would be necessary [says d’Holbach] to define the vital
principle, which I deem impossible.” Is not this definition very easy?…
Is not</p>
<p>life organization with feeling? But that these two properties can
arise solely from matter in motion it is impossible to prove; and if it
is im- possible to prove, why affirm it?… Many readers will feel
indignant at the decisive tone assumed when nothing is explained….
When</p>
<p>you venture to affirm that there is no God, or that matter acts of
itself by an eternal necessity, you must demonstrate this like a
proposition in Euclid; otherwise you rest your system on a “perhaps.”
What a</p>
<p>foundation for a belief that is of the greatest importance to the
human race!</p>
<p>D’H olbach had supported abiogenesis by referring to the experiments
(1748) of the English Jesuit Needham, who believed that he had produced
new organisms out of nonliving matter. Voltaire, alert to the latest de-
velopments in science, referred to the experiments (1765) of Spallanzani
as having shown the error of Needham’s procedure and conclusions.
D’Holbach had seen no design in nature; Voltaire sees much. He argues
that the development of intelligence in man indicates an intelligence in
or behind the universe. Finally he returns to his famous proposition
that “if God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him”; that
without be - lief in a Supreme Being, in his intelligence and his
justice, life with its mysteries and miseries would be unbeara ble. He
joins d’Holbach in scorn - ing superstition, but he defends religion as
the simple adoration of a deity. He concludes amiably:</p>
<p>I am persuaded that you are in a great error, but 1 am equally
con-</p>
<p>vinced that you are honest in your self-delusion. You would have men
virtuous even without a God, although you have unfortunately said</p>
<p>hat “so soon as vice renders man happy he must love vice”— a
frightful</p>

<p>proposition, which your friends should have prevailed upon you to</p>
<p>erase. Everywhere else you inspire probity. This philosophical
dispute will only be between you and a few philosophers scattered
over</p>
<p>Europe, and the rest of the world will not even hear of it. The
people do not read us…. You are wrong, but we owe respect to your</p>
<p>genius and your virtue. 152</p>
<p>We do not know if Voltaire had his heart in this refutation. We note
his light remark, when he heard that Frederick also had written against
he Systeme de la nature, “God had on his side the two least
superstitious men in all Europe — which ought to have pleased him
immensely.” 153 He asked the Due de Richelieu to let Louis XV know that
the unwilling exile of Ferney had written an answer to the audacious
book that was the talk of Paris.</p>
<p>D’Holbach’s friends published Voltaire’s critique as a means of
advertis - ing the Baron’s ideas. Young rebels took up materialism as a
badge of brav - ery in the war against Catholicism. D’Holbach’s
philosophy entered into the spirit of the French Revolution before and
after Robespierre — who preferred Rousseau; we hear echoes of the
Systeme in Camille Desmoulins, Marat, and Danton. 154 “D’Holbach, mor e
than Voltaire, more than Di- derot,” said Faguet, “is the father of all
the philosophy and all the anti - religious polemics of the end of the
eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century.” 155 During the
Directory a minister sent copies of a book by d’Holbach to all
departmental heads in an attempt to check the Catholic revival. 156 In
England we feel d’Holbach’s influence in the ma - terialism of Priestley
(1777); Godwin’s Enquiry concerning Political Jus - tice stemmed from
d’Holbach, He lvetius, and Rousseau in that order of influence; 157 and
the enthusiastic atheism of Godwin’s son -in-law, Shelley, dated from
his reading of the Systeme de la nature , which he began to translate as
a means of enlisting the Oxford dons in the campaign against religion.
158 In Germany it was d’Holbach’s materialism, as well as Hume’s
skepticism, that aroused Kant from his “dogmatic slumber.” Perhaps Marx,
through devious channels, inherited his materialist tradition from d’Hol
- bach.</p>
<p>Long before the Baron wrote, Berkeley had made the most damaging
point about materialism: mind is the only reality directly known; matter
(since d’Holbach defined it as “all that affects our senses”) is known
only indirectly, through mind; and it seems unreasonable to reduce the
directly to the indirectly known. We are not so clear about matter as we
used to be; we are as much mystified by the atom as by mind; both are
being re- solved into forms of energy that we cannot understand. And it
is as diffi- cult now as in the days of Locke and Voltaire to imagine
how “matter”</p>

<p>of life proved fruitful in physiology, but the possibility still
remains that organs (matter) may be products and instruments of desire
(mind), like the muscles of an athlete. Mechanism, determinism, even
“natural law,” may be summary simplifications, logically irrefutable
because they are tools invented by the mind for the convenient handling
of phenomena, events, and things. These tools have become inextricable
elements in scientific thought, but they are unsatisfactory when applied
to the mind that fash- ioned them. We do not know that the world is
logical.</p>
