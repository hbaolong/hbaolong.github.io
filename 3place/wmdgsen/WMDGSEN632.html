<h4 id="chapter-xxxviii-to-st.-helena">CHAPTER XXXVIII To
St. Helena</h4>
<p>I. THE SECOND ABDICATION: JUNE 2 2, 1 8 1 5</p>
<p>H E reached Paris about 8“a.m. June 21. “I was thoroughly exhausted,”
he later recalled. “For three days I had neither eaten nor slept.” 1 He
went to the filysee Palace, pleading to Caulaincourt, “I need two hours
of rest.” 2 Meanwhile the Chamber of Representatives assembled, and
sentiment there was strongly for his abdication. Informed of this, he
proposed to his friends that the chaos of opinion in the country, and
the need for united ac- tion to defend France and its capital against
any attempt of the Allies to control the nation or its government,
required a temporary dictatorship.</p>
<p>When the people of Paris learned of the military disaster many of
them gathered before the Llysee, affirmed their continued faith in
Napoleon with cries of “ Vive I’Empereur /” and asked for arms that they
might defend the city. Hearing them, Napoleon said to Benjamin Constant,
“You see, it is not these people upon whom I heaped honors and money.
What do they owe me? I found them poor, and I have left them poor…. If I
willed it, in an hour the rebellious Chamber would cease to exist…. But
the life of one man is not worth this price. I do not wish to be the
King of Jacqueries. I did not come from Elba in order that Paris should
be inundated with blood.” 3</p>
<p>Even during his flight from Waterloo he had planned to raise another
army, this time of 300,000 men. 4 Between June 22 and June 24 the
remains of his defeated army gathered and were reorganized at Laon,
seventy-seven miles northeast of Paris; and there, on June 26, Grouchy,
after a brilliant retreat, joined them with 30,000 men. Meanwhile,
however, Bliicher had assembled his victorious forces, and was leading
them toward Paris, care- fully bypassing Laon. Wellington, his army
badly hurt, hesitated to join the impetuous Prussian, but soon he too
was on the road, also avoiding Laon. At the same time, June 22-25, the
armies of Austria, Bavaria, and Wiirttemberg crossed the Rhine and
headed for Paris. History repeated it- self.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Representatives, after passionate debates, concluded
that resistance to the Allies was impracticable, and that they would
insist on Napoleon’s abdication. Fouche, still Napoleon’s minister of
police, worked in his subtle ways to secure this abdication. He had
predicted, be- fore Waterloo, “The Emperor will win one or two battles;
he will lose the third; at that point our role will begin.” 5 But Fouch
e did not wait that long. Napoleon’s brother Lucien rushed to the
Chamber to urge delay; Fouche worked against him, and Lafayette asked,
Had not Napoleon consumed enough lives? Lucien, victor in 1799, admitted
failure now. He advised Na-</p>

<p>TO ST. HELENA</p>
<p>751</p>
<p>poleon to forcibly overthrow the chambers; Napoleon refused. The
exhaus- tion of battle and defeat had weakened his will, but had
clarified his vision; and while the crowd outside the palace continued
to shout “ Vive VEm- pereur!” he dictated to Lucien, June 22, 1815, his
Second Abdication, ad - dressed to the two chambers:</p>
<p>In beginning the war for national independence, I counted on the
reunion of all efforts,… and on the agreement of all the nation’s go
verning bodies. Circumstances seem to me to have changed…. I offer
myself as sacrifice to the hatred of the enemies of France. May they be
sincere in their declarations, and in having really desired nothing more
than my person. Unite, all of you, for the public safety, and for our
remaining independent action…. I proclaim my son in the name of Napoleon
II. 6</p>
<p>All his ministers agreed to his abdication except Carnot, who wept.
Fouche rejoiced.</p>
<p>The two chambers accepted the abdication, ignored its nomination of
Napoleon’s four -year-old son (then in Vienna) as his successor, and
chose five of its members — Fouche, Carnot, Caulaincourt, Grenier (an
obscure general), and Ouinette (a member of the old revolutionary
Convention) — to serve as a “Commission Executive” and a Provisional
Government. Fouche was chosen president of the commission, and
negotiated directly with the Allies and Napoleon. Fearing a popular
uprising in favor of Na- poleon, he persuaded Davout, military commander
in the capital, to prevail upon Napoleon to leave Paris and retire to
Malmaison. On June 25, accom- panied by Bertrand, Gourgaud, Comte de Las
Cases, and Comte de Montho- lon, Napoleon left for Malmaison, where
Hortense welcomed him to her late m other’s home. Walking with Hortense
in the garden, he spoke fondly of Josephine. “Truly,” he said, “she was
more full of grace than any woman I have ever seen.” 7</p>
<p>He thought now of seeking refuge and peace in America. He asked Ber-
trand to secure for him several books about the United States. 8 He had
read Alexander von Humboldt’s Voyages aux contrees equinoctiales du
nouveau continent; he proposed to give the remainder of his life to
science; now he would go to America and explore its soil, flora, and
fauna from Canada to Cape Horn. On June 26 he sent to the Provisional
Government a request for passage to Rochefort, with a view to sailing
thence for America. 9 Fouche at once ordered the Minister of Marine to
“prepare two frigates at Roche - fort to carry Napoleon Bonaparte to the
United States.” 10 On that same day Napoleon was visited by his brothers
Joseph, Lucien, and Jerome, who had all decided to leave France — Joseph
for America. Perhaps it was they who brought to him a message from their
mother, offering him “all that she possessed.” He thanked her, but took
no advantage of her offer. He still had a substantial fund with the
banker Jacques Laffitte, who came in person to Malmaison to arrange
Napoleon’s finances.</p>
<p>On June 28 an officer of the Garde Nationale came to warn him that
the Prussians were near enough to Malmaison to send a detachment to
capture</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>75 2</p>
<p>him. Actually Bliicher had ordered a flying column to get Napoleon
alive or dead, and had expressed his intention to shoot him as an
outlaw. 11 Hear- ing of this intention, Gourgaud vowed, “If I see the
Emperor fall into the hands of the Prussians I will shoot him.” Even so,
Napoleon was loath to leave Malmaison, where every room and walk was
rich with happy mem- ories. On June 29 Fouche commissioned General
Becker to go to Malmaison with a squad of troops to compel Napoleon to
leave for Rochefort.</p>
<p>Napoleon agreed to go. Hortense prevailed upon him to accept her dia-
mond necklace, concealed in a belt and worth 200,000 francs. He bade
fare- well to the few soldiers who had been protecting him. At 5 p.m.,
June 29, riding in a caleche drawn by four horses, and with a small
military escort, he left Malmaison. A few hours later Bliicher’s cavalry
arrived.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SECOND RESTORATION: JULY 7, 1 8 1 5</li>
</ol>
<p>The chambers and the Provisional Government debated whether to fight
the oncoming Allies or negotiate for the best obtainable terms. Davout
offered to lead his city militia against Wellington and Bliicher if
these in- sisted on restoring Louis XVIII. The representatives feared
that resistance and defeat would lead to the dismemberment of France,
and something short of that for themselves. T he remnants of Napoleon’s
“Army of the North” were in no mood for another Waterloo; they were
inadequately supplied, and the enemy were united between Laon and
Paris.</p>
<p>Louis XVIII, learning that one faction amon^ the Allies was working
for his replacem ent by Louis Philippe, Due d’Orleans, moved down
anxiously from Ghent to Cateau-Cambresis, and there issued (June 25) a
declaration promising conciliation and a liberal regime. The chambers
were pleased, and on June 30 the Provisional Government and the Allies
signed preliminary terms for the capitulation of the capital. All French
troops were to retire beyond the Loire, but the security and property of
the citizens were guaran- teed. On July 7 the Allies entered Paris. On
July 8 Louis XVIII rode down the Champs-Flysees in state, and resumed
the throne of France. The prefect of the Seine department, in welcoming
him, used — apparently for the first time — the term “Cent Jours,” or
Hundred Days, to describe the period be - tween Napoleon’s second usurp
ation (March 20) and the restoration of the King.</p>
<p>Most of the country accepted this da capo al fine as the only
practical so- lution of the problems raised by the sudden collapse of
Napoleon’s regime. Bliicher, however, raised an outcry by announcing
that he would ask his engineers to blow up the Pont d’lena— the bridge
commemorating the French victory over the Prussians in 1806; moreover,
he proposed to destroy all monuments to Napoleon. Wellington united with
Louis XVIII in urging Bliicher to desist; he persisted; but Czar
Alexander I, King Frederick Wil- liam III, and Emperor Francis II,
arriving with the Russian, Austrian, and Piedmontese armies, commanded
the old patriot to calm his fury. 12</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl)</p>
<p>TO ST. HELENA</p>
<p>753</p>
<p>The foreign troops in France now totaled some 800,000, all requiring
to be fed by the people, and policing them in return. Castlereagh
calculated that it cost France 1,750,000 francs per day to feed its
occupiers. In addition each district had to pay a heavy indemnity. Louis
XVIII told the Allied leaders that if, contrary to their proclamation of
March 25, they continued to treat his subjects as enemies, he would
leave France and seek asylum in Spain. The Allies agreed to limit the
indemnities to 50 million francs, and argued that they were fully
justified by the laws of war and the precedents established by Napoleon
in Prussia and Austria.</p>
<p>Likewise the royalists in some French cities indulged themselves in a
“White Terror” to avenge the Red Terror that had killed so many
royalists in 1793-94. They were not always without immediate excuse.
When the royalist faction in Marseilles made a demonstration demanding
the restora- tion of Louis XVIII, some soldiers of the local garrison,
still pledged to Na- poleon, fired on them. The commander soon stopped
this, and tried to lead his troops out of the hostile city; but on their
way some hundred of them were shot from windows or roofs (June 25). On
that day and the next armed royalists ran about the city, shooting
Bonapartists and Jacobins; two hundred victims died, many of them still
crying “Vive I’Empereur!” Royal - ist women danced with joy around the
corpses. 13 At Avignon the royalists imprisoned and killed all captured
Bonapartists. One man they sought espe- cially — Guillaume Brune, who
was accused of having carried the head of the Princesse de Lamballe on
his pike in 1792. He hid in an Avignon hotel; the crowd found him, shot
him, and dragged his corpse through the streets, beating it
ecstatically; then, having thrown it into the Rhone, the men and women
danced with joy (August 2, 1815). There were similar scenes at Nimes,
Montpellier, and Toulouse.</p>
<p>These barbarities could hardly be attributed to Louis XVIII, who was
basically a forgiving man. But he could never forgive Ney, who had prom-
ised to bring to him Napoleon alive or dead, had gone over to Napoleon,
and had dealt out so many deaths at Waterloo. Ney fled from Paris on
July 6, and wandered from town to town in disguise; he was recognized
and arrested; was tried by a court of 16 1 peers, and was found guilty
of treason. He refused all priestly services, and was executed by a
firing squad on De- cember 7, 1815.</p>
<p>Fouche and Talleyrand, now in Louis XVIII’s ministry, were triumphant
but unhappy. The royalists in the Cabinet shunned Fouche as a regicide,
and advised the King to dismiss him. Louis compromised by appointing him
minister to Saxony (September 15); but three months later he recalled
him and banished him from France. Fouche wandered unwanted from Prague
to Linz to Trieste, and died there in 1820, having crowded an incredible
amount of deviltry into sixty-one years.</p>
<p>Talleyrand rivaled him in wiles, and surpassed him in durability.</p>
<p>Louis XVIII judged him with lines from Corneille: “He has done me too
much good that I should speak ill of him, and too much harm that I
should speak well of him.” 14 It was apparendy Talleyrand who said of
the Bour -</p>
<p>754</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>bons (in 1796), “They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing”; 15
but this could hardly have been said of Louis XVIII, who learned to deal
with elected chambers, welcomed Napoleon’s generals, and preserved much
of Napoleon’s legislation. The royalist ministers hated Talleyrand as
not only a regicide and an apostate but a traitor to his class. Yielding
to them, Louis dismissed him (September 24, 1815). Talleyrand recovered,
outlived Louis XVIII, survived the abdication of Charles X (1830), and
was ap- pointed ambassador to Great Britain (1830-34) at the age of
seventy-six. When the Marquess of Londonderry, in the House of Lords,
criticized Talleyrand, Wellington defended him; he had dealt with M. de
Talleyrand in many situations (said the Duke), and never had he found a
man more vigorous and skillful in protecting the interests of his
country, and more upright and honorable in dealing with other countries.
When Talleyrand read this he came close to tears, than which nothing
could have been more unbecoming in him. “I am all the m ore grateful to
the Duke, since he is the one statesman in the world who has ever spoken
well of me.” 16 Having helped to organize the Quadruple Alliance in
1834, he died in 1838, aged eighty-four, having outwitted everybody,
almost the Reaper himself. On November 20, 1815, Louis XVIII signed with
the Allies the Second Treaty of Paris, which formulated the penalties
France was to suffer for allowing Napoleon to resume his rule. She was
compelled to cede the Saar and Savoy, and four frontier towns, including
Philippeville and Marienburg; to restore the art her conquering generals
had taken; to pay an indemnity of 700 million francs, plus 240 million
on private claims; to be occupied by the commissioners and troops of the
Allies for from three to five years, and to pay for their maintenance.
17 Talleyrand refused to sign this document; his successor as foreign
minister, Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Due de Richelieu, signed it under
protest, and then cried out, “I am dishonored.” 18</p>
<p>hi. surrender: July 4 - august 8, 1815</p>
<p>Riding south from Malmaison; Napoleon was joined at Niort by his</p>
<p>brother Joseph and his brother-in-arms Gourgaud. They reached
Rochefort (thirteen miles southeast of La Rochelle) late on July 3, and
found the ex- pected frigates — the Saale and the Meduse — anchored in
the harbor; but be- hind these was a small squadron of British warships
blockading the port and apparently forbidding unlicensed egress.</p>
<p>On July 4 Napoleon sent an inquiry to the captain of the Saale —
could rooms be prepared for him and some friends for a voyage to
America, and could the Saale get through the blockade? He was told that
the frigates were ready, and might try to elude the warships at night,
at the risk of being stopped or bombarded; but if they got through,
their superior speed would soon lose the men-of-war. Napoleon now
revealed the effects of his recent ordeals by beginning nine days of
vacillation, turning from one plan to another for escape, and from one
companion to another for advice. Jo-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl)</p>
<p>TO ST. HELENA</p>
<p>755</p>
<p>seph, who resembled him in appearance, offered to disguise himself as
the Emperor, and to let himself be detained by the British, while
Napoleon, in civilian dress, might be allowed to leave on one of the
frigates on an appar- ently routine voyage. Napoleon refused to endanger
his brother. Joseph himself later sailed on one of the frigates to
America.</p>
<p>Forgetting fifteen years of war, Napoleon now played with the fancy
that England, if he voluntarily surrendered, might treat him as a
distin- guished prisoner, and allow him a modest plot of land on which
he might five as a peaceful squire. On July io he sent Las Cases and
Savary (Due de Rovigo) to ask Captain Frederick Maitland, on H.M.S.
Bellerophon, if any passports had been received by him for Napoleon’s
passage to America. The captain, of course, had none. Then Las Cases
asked whether, if Napo- leon surrendered himself to the British, he
might expect to be treated with the usual generosity of the English
people. Maitland replied that he would be glad to receive Napoleon and
take him to England, but that he had no authority to make any promise
about his reception there.</p>
<p>Shortly before or after or during that conversation Captain Maitland
re- ceived from his superior, Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Hotham (then
cruising off the northwest coast of France), a message apprising him
that Napoleon was in or near Rochefort, and was intending to cross to
America. The ad- miral added: “You will employ the best means of
preventing him from sail - ing on the frigates…. If you have the good
fortune to capture him, you will put him under good guard, and proceed
with all careful speed to a port in Brita in.” 19</p>
<p>On or about July 14 Napoleon received warning that Louis XVIII
had</p>
<p>ordered General Bonnefours to proceed to Rochefort and arrest him. 20
Bonnefours acted as slowly as he dared. Napoleon now felt restricted to
three choices: to surrender to Louis XVIII, who had every reason to hate
him; to risk capture in an attempt to defy the British blockade; or to
sur- render to Captain Maitland in the hope of British generosity. He
chose the last course. On July 14 he wrote to the Prince Regent, who was
then ruling Great Britain:</p>
<p>Your Royal Highness:</p>
<p>Exposed to the factions which distract my country, and to the
disunity of the greatest powers in Europe, I have ended my political
career, and I come, like Themistocles, to sit at the hearth of the
British people. I put myself under the protection of their laws, which I
invoke from Your Royal Highness as the most powerful, the most
determined, and the most generous of my enemies, to grant me this
protection.</p>
<p>Napoleon 21 *</p>
<p>Napoleon entrusted this letter to Gourgaud, and asked him to seek
permis- sion to take it to London by the next boat. Maitland agreed, but
the boat</p>

<p>756</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>hat carried Gourgaud was long detained by quarantine, and there is no
evidence that the letter ever reached its destination.</p>
<p>On July 15 Napoleon and his companions were taken to the Bellerophon,
and offered themselves in voluntary surrender to Great B ritain. “I come
aboard your ship,” said Napoleon to Maitland, “to place myself under the
protection of the laws of England.” 22 The captain received them courte
- ously, and agreed to give them passage to England. He told them
nothing of Admiral Hotham’ s message, but he warned Napoleon that he
could not guarantee him a favorable reception in England. On July 16 the
Bellerophon sailed for England.</p>
<p>In retrospect Maitland gave a good mark to his prize captive:</p>
<p>His manners were extremely pleasing and affable. He joined in every
conver- sation, related numerous anecdotes, and endeavoured in every way
to promote good humour. He admitted his attendants to great
familiarity,… though they generally treated him with much respect. He
possessed, to a wonderful degree, a facility in making a favorable
impression upon those with whom he entered into conversation. 23</p>
<p>The British crew were charmed, and treated him with the greatest
deference.</p>
<p>On July 24 the Bellerophon reached Tor Bay, an inlet of the English
Chan- nel on the coast of Devonshire. Soon two armed frigates placed
themselves on either side of the ship; Napoleon was clearly a prisoner.
Admiral Vis- count Keith came on board and greeted him with simple
courtesy: Gour- gaud followed to tell Napoleon that he had been unable
to get his letter through to the Prince Regent, but had been compelled
to give it to Keith, who made no mention of it. 24 Keith bade Maitland
bring his ship into Plymouth harbor, thirty miles away; there the
Bellerophon remained till August 5. During that time it became a goal of
British curiosity; from every corner of southern England men and women
rode to Plymouth, crowded into boats, and waited for the imperial ogre
to take his daily walk on the deck.</p>
<p>The British government spent days determining what to do with him.
The predominant opinion was in favor of treating him as an outlaw who
had been declared so by the formal declaration of the Allies, and as one
who had been leniently dealt with by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, had
violated his pledge to observe that treaty, and thereby had forced
Europe into another war costly in lives and wealth. Obviously he
deserved death, and if merely imprisoned he should be grateful. But now
the imprisonment must be such as to make it impossible for the offender
to escape and fight again. Some mercy might be due him for having freely
surrendered, saving the Allies much trouble; but this mercy must not
allow any possibility of escape. So the British government bade Keith
inform the prisoner that he must make his home henceforth on the island
of St. Helena, some twelve hundred miles west of Africa. It was remote,
but it had to be, and its remoteness would re- lieve the prisoner and
his custodians from the necessity of close confinement stringently
supervised. England’s allies were consulted, and agreed to the</p>

<p>TO ST. HELENA</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>verdict, merely stipulating their right to send commissioners to the
island to share in supervision.</p>
<p>Napoleon almost broke down when he learned that he had been con-
demned to what he considered a living death. He fought back with pas-
sionate protests, but yielded when he saw that these were met with
silent resolution. He was granted some favors. He was allowed to choose
five willing friends to accompany him. He named General Bertrand, his
“grand marshal of the palace”; the Comte and Comtesse de Montholon ( he
had been Napoleon’s aide -de-camp at Waterloo); General Gourgaud, his
de- voted protector; and (counting for one) the Comte de Las Cases and
his son. Each was allowed to take servants and 1,600 francs. Napoleon
took several servants, and managed to take a considerable sum of money.
Hortense’s diamond necklace was concealed in Las Cases’ belt; 350,000
francs were hidden in the garments of his servants. Each man in the
party was required to give up his sword; but when Admira l Keith came to
receive Napoleon’s the Emperor threatened to draw it in self-defense,
and Keith did not insist. 25</p>
<p>On August 4 the Bellerophon left Plymouth for Portsmouth, and there
surrendered its prisoner, his retinue, and their belongings to a larger
ship, the Northumberland, which on August 8 left for St. Helena.</p>
