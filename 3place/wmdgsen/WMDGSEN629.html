<h4 id="chapter-xxxiv-russia">CHAPTER XXXIV Russia</h4>
<p>1796-1812*</p>
<p>I. MILIEU</p>
<p>RANCE and Austria,” wrote Talleyrand in 1816, “… would be the</p>
<p>J. strongest powers in Europe if, during the last century, another
power had not risen in the North, whose terrible and rapid progress must
make one dread that the numerous encroachments by which she has already
signaled herself are but the prelude of still further conquests, which
will end in swal- lowing up everything.” 1</p>
<p>Space can make history. Run the eye across a map of the world from
Kaliningrad (which Kant knew as Konigsberg) on the Baltic to Kamchatka
on the Pacific; then from the Arctic Ocean to the Caspian Sea, the Hima-
layas, Mongolia, China, Japan: all between is Russia. Let the map speak;
or hear Mme. de Stael, driving from Vienna to St. Petersburg in
1812:</p>
<p>There is so much space in Russia that everything is lost in it, even
the chateaux, even the population. You might suppose you were traveling
through a country from which the people had just taken their departure….
The Ukraine is a very fertile country, but by no means agreeable…. You
see large plains of wheat which appear to be cultivated by invisible
hands, the habitations and inhabitants are so rare. 2</p>
<p>The inhabitants huddled in scattered villages because memory had not
died of Tatars who had ravaged there, killing joyfully; they had gone,
but their like might come again; and they had left some of their
violence in Russian ways, tempered by toil and discipline. Natural
selection had been merciless, and had favored those men who had hungered
and labored tire- lessly for land and women. Peter the Great had made
some of them into soldiers or navigators; his successors had brought in
venturesome Germans and clever Czechs to help people the plains.
Catherine the Great had pushed swelling armies and swilling generals
ever farther south, driving Tatars and Turks before them, conquering the
Crimea, and triumphantly sailing the Black Sea. Under Alexander I the
expansion continued; Russians settled in Alaska, set up a fort near San
Francisco, and established a colony in Cali- fornia. 3</p>
<p>The hard climate of European Russia — unprotected by forests or

<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>RUSSIA</p>
<p>673</p>
<p>ains against arctic cold or tropical heat — made a tough people,
ready to accomplish the impossible if given bread and time. They could
be cruel, for life had been cruel to them; they could torture prisoners
and massacre Jews. But these barbarities rose in part out of their own
experiences and memories of insecurity and hostility; they were not
irrevocably in their blood, for the increasing security of organized
communal life made them gentler, pitying, wondering, like a million
Karamazovs, why they killed or sinned. They looked with an abiding
melancholy upon a violent and unintelligible world.</p>
<p>Religion appeased their wonder and tamed their violence. The priests
played here — as Roman Catholic priests had done in the early stages of
West European communities — the role of the “spiritual arm,” buttressing
the forces of the law with the secret and diverse powers of the myth to
mystify or ex- plain, to terrify or console. The czars knew how vital
these myths were to social order, patient labor, and self-sacrificing
heroism in war and peace. They paid the higher clergy well, and the
lower clergy enough to keep them alive and patriotic. They protected
religious dissent if it remained loyal to the state and kept the peace;
Catherine II and Alexander I winked an eye at Freemasonry lodges that
cautiously proposed political reforms.</p>
<p>The Russian nobles claimed and used all feudal rights, and controlled
al- most every element in the life of their serfs. The feudal lord could
sell his serfs, or lease them to work in town factories. He could
imprison them, and punish them with rod or whip or knout (a knotted
rope). He could hand them over to the government for labor or
imprisonment in Siberia. 4 There were some mitigations. The sale of a
serf apart from his family was rare. Some nobles contributed to a serf’s
education, usually for t echnical work on the owner’s property,
sometimes for wider use; so we hear ( c. 1800) of a serf who managed a
textile enterprise employing five hundred looms — but most of these were
in houses on the vast estates of the Sheremetev family. A census of
Russia in 1783 reported a total population of 25,677,058; of the
12,838,529 males 6,678,239 were serfs of private landowners —
i.e. (includ- ing one female for each male), over half the population.
Russian serfdom reached its climax at this time; it worsened in the
reign of the great Cather- ine, and Alexander I gave up his early
attempts to lessen it.®</p>
<p>The same census reckoned Russia’s population as 94.5 percent rural,
but this included peasants working and living in the towns. The towns
were growing slowly, having only 1,301,000 inhabitants in 179 6. 6
Commerce was active and growing, especially along the coasts and the
great canals; Odessa was already a busy center of maritime trade.
Industry was growing more slowly in the town factories, for much of it
was practiced in rural shops and homes. Class war was much less between
a proletariat and its employers than between rising merchants, groaning
over taxes, and the tax-free nobility.</p>
<p>Class differences were sharp, and were defined by law; nevertheless,
they were blurred as the economy grew and education spread. Russian
rulers be- fore Peter the Great had usually frowned upon schools as
opening avenues to West European radicalism and impiety; Peter, admiring
the West, estab-</p>
<p>674 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>lished schools of navigation and engineering for sons of the
nobility, “dio - cesan schools” to prepare priests, and forty -two
elementary schools opened to all classes but serfs, and oriented toward
technology. In 1795 P. A. Shuva- lov founded the University of Moscow,
with two gymnasia, one for nobles, one for free commoners. Catherine,
inspired by the French philosophes, spread schools widely, and advocated
the education of women. She allowed private publishing firms;
eighty-four percent of the books published in eighteenth-century Russia
were issued during her reign. By 1 800 Russia had already developed an
intelligentsia that would soon be a factor in the na- tion’s political
history. And by 1800 several mer chants, or sons of mer- chants, had
made their way into positions of influence, and even into the court.</p>
<p>Despite the fire-and-brimstone theology of the bishops and the papas
, or local priests, the level of morals and manners was generally lower
than in Western Europe, except in a minority at the court. Almost any
Russian was at heart kind and hospitable, perhaps from seeing others as
fellow sufferers in a hard world; but barbarism simmered in the soul,
remembering times when one had to kill or be killed. Drunkenness was a
common relief from reality, even in the nobility, and the precarious
life of authors brought sev- eral of them to alcoholic addiction and an
early death. 7 Cunning, lying, and petty theft were common in the plebs,
for any trick seemed fair against cruel masters, dishonest merchants, or
inquisitive taxgatherers. Women were al- most as tough as men, worked at
least as hard, fought as fiercely, and, when accident allowed them,
governed as well; what czar, after Peter, ruled as successfully as
Catherine II? Adultery rose with income. Cleanliness was exceptional,
and was especially difficult in winter; on the other hand, few peoples
have been more addicted to hot baths and merciless massage. Venal- ity
ran its full course from serf to nobleman, from town clerk to imperial
minister. “In no other country,” wrote a French ambassador in 1820, “is
corruption so general. It is, in a sense, organized, and there is,
perhaps, not a single government official who could not be bought at a
price.” 8</p>
<p>Under Catherine the court reached a degree of ease and refinement
sec- ond only to Versailles under Louis XV and Louis XVI, though in some
cases barbarism hid behind the bows. In Catherine’s court the language
was French, and the ideas, barring ephemera, were those of the French
aristoc- racy. French nobles like the Prince de Ligne were almost
equally at home in St. Petersburg and Paris. French literature
circulated widely in the northern capital; Italian opera was sung and
applauded there as properly as in Venice or Vienna; and Russian women of
money and pedigree held their heads and wigs as high, and pleased their
men as variously, as the duchesses of the Ancien Regime. Nothing in the
social festivities along the Seine surpassed the splendor of the
gatherings that, in the sumptuous palace on the Neva, saw the summer sun
lingering in the evening sky as if loath to leave the scene. 9</p>

<p>RUSSIA</p>
<p>6 75</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>PAUL i: 1796-1801</li>
</ol>
<p>At the pinnacle of this courtly splendor was a madman. Paul (Pavel
Petro- vich) was son of Catherine II, but genius skipped a generation,
and left Paul little but morose suspicions and the dementia of absolute
power.</p>
<p>He was eight years old when he learned that his father, Czar Peter
III, had been slain through the connivance of Aleksei Orlov, brother to
Grigori Orlov, the current paramour of Paul’s mother. Paul never quite
recovered</p>
<p>His second wife, Maria Feodorovna, bore him a son (1777), Alexander,
whom Catherine for a time thought of naming her successor, bypassing
Paul. She never developed the idea into action, but Paul surmised it,
and it left him suspicious of his son. In 1783 Catherine gave Paul an
estate at Gatchina, thirty miles from St. Petersburg; there Paul trained
his own regiment, drill- ing it, after his father’s example, in the
goose -step style of Frederick the Great. Catherine, fearing that he was
planning another attempt to replace her, sent spies to watch him. He set
spies to watch the spies. He had halluci- nations of meeting, at night,
the ghost of his ancestor Peter I the Great. His mind was already near
breaking point when, in 1796, after forty-two un- happy years, he came
at last to the throne that he had long considered right- fully his
own.</p>
<p>In a flurry of good feeling he issued some benevolent edicts. He
liberated several victims of Catherine’s senescent fears— Novikov and
Radishchev, radical thinkers, and Kosciusko and others who had fought
for Polish free- dom. He was so horrified by conditions in the Moscow
Hospital that he ordered its renovation and reorganization (1797), with
the result that the New Moscow Hospital became one of the best in
Europe. 10 He reformed and stabilized the currency. He lowered the
tariffs that had been stifling foreign trade, and he opened new canals
to internal commerce.</p>
<p>However, he sent a flurry of commands to his troops about polishing
but- tons, repairing uniforms, and powdering wigs; to his subjects
prescribing their dress and forbidding, under severe penalties, garments
or styles of dress, that had been introduced into Europe after the
French Revolution. 11 In 1 800 he prohibited the import of books
published abroad, and discouraged the printing of new books in Russia.
He checked the autocracy of the nobles, but transferred to private
landowners 530,000 serfs who had previ- ously enjoyed easier conditions
as serfs of the state. He sanctioned the severe</p>
<p>6j6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>punishment of rebellious serfs — “as much as their owner will
desire.” 12 His troops, once devoted to him, resented his unrelenting
surveillance and im- perious discipline.</p>
<p>His foreign policy was incalculably versatile. He canceled the plans
of Catherine to send forty thousand soldiers against Revolutionary
France. He resented Napoleon’s appropriation of Malta and Egypt, and
allied Russia with Turkey and England against him; he persuaded the
Sultan to allow Rus- sian warships to pass through the Bosporus and the
Dardanelles; his Navy took the Ionian Islands, and landed troops in the
kingdom of Naples to help eject the French. But when Great Britain
refused to surrender Malta to him as elected grandmaster of the Knights
of Malta, Paul withdrew from the coalition against France, and fell in
love with Napoleon. When Napoleon responded with gestures of goodwill
Paul forbade all trade with England, and seized all British goods in
Russian stores. He discussed with Napoleon a Franco-Russian expedition
to expel England from India. His fits of anger multiplied as foreign
affairs ignored his wishes, and as domestic compliance waned before the
profusion of his demands. He punished severely the slight- est offenses,
banishing from Moscow nobles who had questioned his policies, and
sending to Siberia army officers tardy in obedience. His son Alexander
had often been the object of Paul’s special wrath and insults. 13</p>
<p>More and more nobles and officers joined in a conspiracy to unseat
him. General Levin Bennigsen enlisted Count Nikita Panin, minister of
foreign affairs, and won over to their plan Count Peter von Pahlen, who
com- manded the city soldiers and police. They sought and finally
obtained Alex- ander’s consent, on condition that no bodily harm should
come to his fa - ther. They agreed to this, knowing that a fait accompli
is a convincing argu- ment. At two o’clock on the morning of March 24,
1801, Pahlen led the conspirators and a band of officers into the
Mikhailovsky Palace, where they overcame all guards, surrounded the
struggling Emperor, and choked him to death. A few hours later they
notified Alexander that he was now czar of Russia.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE EDUCATION OF AN EMPEROR</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hard for minds immersed for years in the tale of the comet
called Napoleon to realize that Alexander I (Aleksandr Pavlovich,
1777-1825) was as much beloved in Russia as Bonaparte in France; that,
like his friend and enemy, he was brought up on the French
Enlightenment, and tempered his autocracy with liberal ideas; that he
achieved what the greatest modern gen- eral (for we must respect the
Czar’s namesake) had tried and failed to ac - complish — led his army
across the Continent from his own capital to his foe’s, and overcame
him; and that in the hour of triumph he behaved with moderation and
modesty, and, amid so many generals and geniuses, proved to be the best
gentleman of them all. Could this paragon have come from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) RUSSIA 677</p>
<p>Russia? Yes, but after a long immersion, by a Swiss, in the
literature and philosophy of France.</p>
<p>His education deserved another Xenophon to make it into a second
Cyro- paedeia about the youth and training of a king. Many conflicting
elements confused it. First his solicitous but absent and busy
grandmother, the great Catherine herself, who had removed him from his
mother, and transmitted to him, before she lost them, the principles of
enlightened despotism, min- gled with snatches from her then favorite
authors — Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot. Probably at her suggestion he
was taught from his early childhood to sleep, lightly covered, with the
windows wide open, and on a mattress of morocco leather stuffed with
hay. 14 He became almost immune to weather, and enjoyed “extraordinary
health and vitality”; but he died at the</p>
<p>In 1784 Catherine brought in from Switzerland, as Alexander’s
principal tutor, Frederic-Cesar de La Harpe (1754-1838), an enthusiastic
devotee of the philosophies, and later of the Revolution. Through nine
years of dedi- cated service he initiated Alexander into the history and
literature of France. The Prince learned to speak French perfectly, and
almost to think like a Frenchman. (Napoleon spoke French imperfectly,
and thought like a Ren- aissance Italian.) A nurse had already taught
Alexander English; and now Mikhail Muraviov instructed him in the
language and literature of ancient Greece. Count N. J. Saltykov
transmitted to him the customs of imperial autocracy. There were special
tutors in mathematics, physics, and geogra- phy. And Archpriest
Somborsky conveyed to him the ethics of Christianity in the principle
that each must “f ind in every human being his neighbor in order to
fulfill the law of God.” 15 Perhaps we should add, to this roster of
Alexander’s teachers, Luise Elisabeth of Baden -Durlach, who in 1793, at
Catherine’s request, married him, then sixteen, and— now named Elizaveta
Alekseevna — presumably taught him the proper ways of a man with a
woman.</p>
<p>It was an education fit to make a scholar and a gentleman, but hardly
an “autocrat of all the Russias.” When the progress of the French
Revolution frightened Catherine out of Voltaire and Diderot she
dismissed La Harpe (1794), who returned to Switzerland to lead the
revolution there. Alexander found realities at court and at Gatchina
confusingly unlike the disputes of philosophy and the ideals of
Rousseau. Dismayed by the complexity of the problems that faced the
government, and perhaps missing the optimism of La Harpe, and brooding
over his grandmother’s death, he wrote in 1796 to his close friend Count
Kochubey:</p>
<p>I am thoroughly disgusted with my situation. It is far too brilliant
for my character, which fits much better with a life of peace and quiet.
Court life is not for me. I feel miserable in the society of such
people…. At the same time they occupy the highest offices in the empire.
In one word, my dear friend, I am aware that I was not born for the high
position which I now occupy, and even less for that which awaits me in
the future, and I have sworn to myself to renounce it in one way or
another…. The affairs of state are in complete disorder; graft and
embezzlement are everywhere; all departments are badly</p>
<p>678</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>managed…. Notwithstanding all this, the Empire tends only toward
expan- sion. Is it possible, therefore, for me to administer the state,
even more to reform it and to abolish the long existing evils? To my
mind it is beyond the power of a genius, not to speak of a man with
ordinary capacities like myself.</p>
<p>Taking all this into consideration, I have arrived at the aforesaid
decision. My plan consists in abdicating (I cannot say: when), and in
settling with my wife on the shores of the Rhine to live the life of a
private citizen, devote my time to the company of my friends and to the
study of nature. 16</p>
<p>Fortune gave him five years in which to adjust himself to the demands
of his situation. He learned to appreciate the constructive elements in
Russian life: the idealism and devotion inspired by Christianity, the
readiness for mutual aid, the courage and hardihood that had been
developed in the wars with the Tatars and the Turks, the power and depth
of the Slavic imagina- tion, which was soon to create a literature
profound and unique, and the silent pride that rose from consciousness
of Russian space and time. When, on March 24, 1801, Alexander, poet and
would-be recluse, was suddenly challenged with opportunity, he found in
his roots and dreams the under- standing and character to summon his
people to greatness, and to make Rus- sia the arbiter of Europe.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE YOUNG CZAR: 1801-04</li>
</ol>
<p>He did not at once dismiss Panin or Pahlen, who had arranged the
death of his father; he feared their power, and was not sure of his own
innocence; he needed Pahlen and his police to keep Moscow quiet, and
Panin to deal with England, whose fleet, after destroying the Danish
Navy, was threatening to do the same to the Russian. Britain was
appeased; the Second League of Armed Neutrality collapsed. Pahlen was
dismissed in June, Panin resigned in September, 1801.</p>
<p>On the first day of his reign Alexander ordered the release of
thousands of political prisoners. He soon dismissed the men who had
served Paul as counselors, or as agents in his terroristic measures. On
March 30 he brought together “twelve high officials least mistrusted,”
17 and formed them into a “Permanent Council” to advise him in
legislation and administration. He called to his side, some from
banishment, the most liberal of the nobles: Count Viktor Kochubey as
minister of the interior, Nikolai Novosiltsov as secretary of state,
Count Pavel Stroganov as minister of public instruction, and, as
minister of foreign affairs, Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, a Polish
patriot reconciled to Russian sovereignty. These and other departmental
heads, together, constituted a Committee of Ministers, serving as
another advisory council. As still another adviser Alexander recalled La
Harpe from Switzerland (November, 1801) to help him formulate and
coordinate his policies. Under this executive structure was a senate of
nobles with legisla- tive and judicial powers, whose ukases or decrees
(corresponding to the senatus consulta under Napoleon) had the force of
law unless vetoed by the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) RUSSIA 679</p>
<p>czar. Provincial administration continued to be by appointees of the
central government.</p>
<p>All this resembles the imperial constitution under Napoleon, except
for the lack of a popularly elected lower chamber, and the continuance
of a serfdom quite devoid of political rights. Alexande r’s advisers, in
his first years of rule, were liberal and well- educated men, but (in
Napoleon’s phrase) they were “subject to the nature of things.” In that
context “rights” seemed to be fanciful abstractions in the face of
necessities — for economic and po- litical order, for production and
distribution, defense and survival — in a nation ninety percent composed
of strong, unlettered peasants who could not be expected to think beyond
their village. Alexander was subject to a powerful nobility almost
self-sustained by their organization and local rule of agriculture, the
judiciary, the police, and rural industry. Serfdom was so deeply rooted
in time and status that the Czar did not dare attack it for fear or
disrupting social order and losing his throne. Alexander received
complaints sent up from the peasants, and in “many cases he inflicted
severe punishments on the guilty owners,” 18 but he could not build upon
such cases a program of liberation. Sixty years would pass before
Alexander II (two years before Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation)
succeeded in free - ing the serfs of Russia. Napoleon, returning
defeated from Russia in 1812, found no fault with his victorious foe in
this matter. “Alexander,” he told Caulaincourt, “is too libera l in his
vision and too democratic for his Russians;… that nation needs a strong
hand. He would be more suited to the Pari- sians…. Gallant to women,
flattering with men… His fine bearing and extreme courtesy are very
pleasing.” 19 *</p>
<p>Within the imposed limits Alexander made some progress. He managed to
free 47,153 peasants. He ordered the laws to be reduced to system,
consis- tency, and clarity. “Basing the people’s welfare on the
uniformity of our laws,” said his explanatory rescript, “and believing
that various measures may bring the land happy times, but that only the
law may affirm them forever, I have endeavored, from the very first day
of my reign, to investi- gate the conditions of this department of the
state.” 20 Accusation , trial, and punishment were to follow a definite
and prescribed procedure. Political offenses were to be tried before
ordinary courts, not before secret tribunals. New regulations abolished
the secret police, forbade torture (Paul had for- bidden it, but it had
continued throughout his reign), allowed free Russians to move about and
go abroad, and allowed foreigners to enter Russia more freely. Twelve
thousand exiles were invited to return. Censorship of the press
remained, but it was placed under the Ministry of Education, with a
polite request that it be lenient with authors. 21 The embargo on the
import of foreign books was ended, but foreign magazines remained under
the ban.</p>

<li>This view of Alexander, by one who knew him well and had little
reason to love him, contrasts with the view of him, in some recent
French histories, as insincere in his liberalism, and covering with
handsome phrases a foreign policy of treachery and deceit. See Georges

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>A statute of 1804 established academic freedom under university
councils.</p>
<p>Alexander realized that no reform could prosper unless supported and
understood by a wide proportion of the people. In 1802 he gave to the
Ministry of Education, aided by Novosiltsov, Czartoryski, and Mikhail
Muraviov, the task of organizing a new system of public education. A
stat- ute of January 26, 1803, divided Russia into six regions, and
called for at least one university in each region, at least one
secondary school in each gubemiya, or province, at least one county
school in each county seat, and at least one primary school for every
two parishes. To the existing univer- sities at Moscow, Vilna, and
Dorpat were added universities at St. Peters- burg, Kharkov, and Kazan.
Meanwhile the nobles maintained tutors and private schools for their
children, and orthodox rabbis bade Jewish parents boycott state schools
as devious devices for undermining the Jewish faith. 22</p>
<p>V. THE JEWS UNDER ALEXANDER</p>
<p>Catherine II had considerably improved the condition of the Jews
within the “Pale of Settlement”— i.e., those regions of Russia in which
Jews were allowed to settle. In 1800 this Pale included all Russian
territory formerly belonging to Poland, and most of southern Russia,
including Kiev, Cherni- gov, Ekaterinoslav, and the Crimea. Outside this
Pale no Jew could qualify for permanent domicile. Within it the Jews,
numbering some 900,000 in 1 804, 23 were to enjoy all civil rights,
including eligibility to office, with one exception: Jews desiring
enrollment in the mercantile or business class in the cities were to pay
a tax double that imposed upon other businessmen, who claimed that
unhindered Jewish competition would ruin them; 24 so the merchants of
Moscow (1790) had lodged a complaint against Jews who sold “foreign
goods by lowering the correct prices, and thereby inflicting very
Serious damage upon the local trade.” 26 Meanwhile their competition was
re - sented by rural tavern keepers, and every effort was made by the
govern- ment to keep them out of villages and confine them to the towns.
In 1795 Catherine ordered that Jews should be registered (and acquire
civil rights) only in towns.</p>
<p>In November, 1802, Alexander appointed a “Committe e for the
Ameliora- tion of the Jews” to study their problems and submit
recommendations. The committee invited the Kahals — the administrative
councils through which the Jewish communities governed and taxed
themselves — to send deputies to St. Petersburg to consult with the
government about Jewish needs. The com- mittee submitted its
recommendation to these deputies. These, after much discussion, asked
for a delay of six months, which would enable them to obtain more
specific authority and instructions from their Kahals. The committee,
instead, sent its recommendations directly to the Kahals. These objected
to the committee’s proposals to exclude Jews from the ownership of land
and the sale of liquor, and asked that these measures be postponed for
twenty years to allow time for difficult economic adjustments. The
commit-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>RUSSIA</p>
<p>68 1</p>
<p>ee refused, and on December 9, 1804, the Russian government, with the
sanction of Czar Alexander, issued the “Jewish Constitution” of
1804.</p>
<p>It was both a bill of rights and an edict of urban confinement. The
rights were substantial. Jewish children were assured free access to all
public schools, Gymnasia, and universities in the Russian Empire. The
Jews might establish their own schools, but one of three languages —
Russian, Polish, or German — must be taught there and be used in legal
documents. Each com- munity might elect its rabbis and Kahal; but the
rabbi must never issue ex- communications, and the Kahal was to be
responsible for collecting all taxes levied by the state. Jews were
invited to engage in agriculture by buying unoccupied land in specified
regions of the Pale, or by settling on crown lands, where, for the first
few years, they would be exempt from state taxes.</p>
<p>However, by January 1, 1808, “no one among the Jews in any village or
hamlet shall be permitted to hold any leases on land, to keep taverns,
saloons, or inns,… or to sell wine in the villages, or ever to live in
them under any pretext whatever.” 26 This meant the displacement of
sixty thousand Jewish families from their village homes. Hundreds of
petitions poured into St. Petersburg, asking for postponement of this
mass evacuation, and many Christians joined in the appeal. Count
Kochubey pointed out to Alexander that Napoleon was planning to convene
in Paris, in February, 1807, a San- hedrin of rabbis from all Western
Europe to formulate measures for the full enfranchisement of the Jews.
Alexander ordered the debated program to be postponed. His meetings with
Napoleon at Tilsit (1807) and Erfurt (1808) may have revived his
ambition to impress the West as a fully enlightened despot. In 1809 he
informed his government that the evacuation plan was impracticable
because “the Jews, on account of their destitute condition, have no
means which would enable them, after leaving their present abodes, to
settle and found a home in new surroundings, while the Government is
equally unable to place them all in new domiciles.” 27 When invasion of
Russia by the French became imminent Alexander complimented himself on
having kept his Jewish citizens fond of him, and loyal to the state.</p>

<p>The Prince de Ligne, who knew everybody and everything of account in
the Europe of his time, described St. Petersburg, about 1787, as “the
finest city in the world.” 28 In 1812 Mme. de Stael judged it to be “one
of the finest cities in the world.” 29 Pe ter I, jealous of Paris, began
the adornment of his newborn capital; Catherine the Great consoled her
discarded lovers with palaces more lasting than her love; and Alexander
I continued the royal guard of classic columns sternly fronting the
Neva. It was the neoclassic period in Europe, and Czar and Czarina,
alike forgetting Russian forms and recalling Rome, sent to Italy and
France for architects and sculptors to come and uphold Slavic pride with
classic art.</p>

<p>682</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>pleted in 1817 by Giacomo Quarenghi and C. J. Rossi, was the most im-
posing royal house in Europe, dwarfing and outshining Versailles:
fifteen miles of corridors, 2,500 rooms, countless columns of marble, a
thousand famous paintings; on the lowest floors, two thousand servants,
and, in one wing, hens, ducks, goats, and pigs, 30 in a consortium paved
with straw.</p>
<p>Alexander I, especially after meeting Napoleon at Tilsit, found
stimulus to rival him not only in the reach of his power but in the
grandeur of his capi- tal. He brought in French and Italian architects
to support with their back- grounds and skills the zeal and energy of
native builders. The Western artists remained attached to classic
models, but they went beyond Rome and its ruins to southern Italy and
such Greek survivals as the temples of Hera at Paestum (Paese, near
Salerno) ; these were as old as the Parthenon, and almost as beautiful;
and the masculine strength of their Doric columns gave fresh spirit to
Russia’s neoclassic ecstasy.</p>
<p>But the distinguishing feature of Alexander’s “Empire style” was the
gradual emergence of Russian architecture from Latin tutelage. Whereas
the outstanding builders of Catherine II’s reign (1762 -96) were three
Ital- ians — Bartolomeo Rastrelli, Antonio Rinaldi, and Giacomo
Quarenghi — the chief architects under Alexander I were Thomas de
Thomon, Andrei Vo- ronykhin, and Adrian Zakharov, three Russians under
French influence, 31 and an Italian, Carlo Rossi, who came to the fore
in the later part of Alex- ander’s reign.</p>
<p>In 1801 Alexander commissioned Thomas to design and build a Stock
Exchange to grace the activities of the rising class of merchants and
finan- ciers in St. Petersburg. The ambitious architect raised (1807
ff.) an immense fane inspired by the temples of Paestum, and matching
the contemporary Bourse (1808-27) of Alexandre Brongniart in Paris. —
Voronykhin’s chef - d’oeuvre is the Kazansky Sobor— the cathedral
dedicated to Our Lady of Kazan, and built on the banks of the Neva in
1801-1 1; its fine semicircular colonnade and three-tiered dome frankly
go back to the masterpieces of Ber- nini and Michelangelo, or, more
immediately, Soufflot’s Pantheon in Paris. — More highly rated is the
Admiralty, a quarter-mile-long complex of col- umns, caryatids, frieze,
and sharply pointed steeple, designed for the Russian Navy. — Rivaling
this sanctuary are the Offices of the General Staff, raised in the
Palace Square by Rossi shortly after Alexander’s death.</p>
<p>At the behest of Nicholas I, Ricard de Montferrand crowned Russia’s
Alexandrian Age with a tall, monolithic column (perhaps remembering the
Vendome Column in Paris), as a lasting tribute to the Czar who had con-
quered France, but had never ceased to reverence its art.</p>
<p>Russian sculptors also sat at the feet of French artists who had
knelt be- fore Roman artists who had borrowed from conquered Greece.
Before the West-oriented Catherine II, the influence of a Byzantine
religion largely Oriental and fearful of the human body as an instrument
of Satan had led the Russians to shun most sculpture in the round; and
only slowly, with the lusty paganism of the Enlightenment entering with
Catherine, had this taboo</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>RUSSIA</p>
<p>683</p>
<p>yielded in the eternal war and oscillation between religion and sex.
Etienne- Maurice Falconet, lured from France by Catherine in 1766,
carved and chiseled in Russia till 1778, and, in his epochal statue of
Peter the Great, not only raised a horse and a man of bronze into the
air, but struck a blow for the right of art to speak its message
uncurbed by anything but its concep- tion of beauty, reality, and
power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nicolas-F rangois Gillet had come in 1758 to teach
sculpture in the Academy of Fine Arts which had been opened in
St. Petersburg a year before. One of his pupils, F. F. Shchedrin, was
sent to Paris to refine his chisel; he did so well that his Venus
rivaled its French model, the Baigneuse of his master, Gabriel
d’Allegrain. It was Shchedrin who carved the cary - atids for the main
portal of Zakharov’s Admira lty. — The last among Gil- let’s famous
pupils, Ivan Markos, worked for some time with Canova and Thorwaldsen in
Rome, and added to their classic idealism something of the Romantic
emotion that was replacing the neoclassic age; critics complained that
he made the marble weep, and that his work was fit only for a ceme-
tery. 32 The cemeteries of Leningrad still display his art.</p>
<p>Russian painting had undergone a basic transformation through French
influence in the Academy of Fine Arts. Till 1750 the art had been almost
en- tirely religious, mostly consisting of icons painted in distemper or
fresco on wood. The French inclinations of Catherine II, and her
importation of French and Italian artists and paintings, soon drew the
Russians to emula- tion; they passed from wood to canvas, from fresco to
oil, from religious to secular subjects — “histories,” portraits,
landscapes, and, last of all, genre.</p>
<p>Four painters reached excellence under Paul and Alexander. Vladimir
Borovikovsky, perhaps taking a hint from Mme. Vigee-Lebrun (who</p>
<p>painted in St. Petersburg in 1800), found attractive sitters among
the young women of the court, with their gay or meditative eyes, their
proud bosoms, and their flowing robes; 33 but also he caught the aging
Catherine in a mo- ment of simplicity and innocence hardly to be
expected of a royal nympho- maniac; and he left, in a ruthless mood, a
discouraging portrait of An Unknown Woman with a Headdress , 34 which is
probably Mme. de Stael circling Europe to escape Napoleon.</p>
<p>Feodor Alekseev, sent to Venice to become a decorator, returned to
be- come one of Russia’s foremost landscape painters. In 1 800 he made
of Mos - cow a series of paintings and drawings that remain as our best
guide to the appearance of that city before Rostopchin’s patriotic
arsons burned a third of it under Napoleon’s nose.</p>
<p>Sylvester Shchedrin, son of the sculptor aforesaid, loved nature more
than women as inspirations to his brush. Dispatched to Italy in 1818 to
study art, he fell in love with the sun, the bays and shores and woods
of Naples and Sorrento, and sent back landscapes that must have made
St. Petersburg doubly cold.</p>
<p>Orest Adamovich Kiprensky (1782-1836) came closest to greatness</p>
<p>among the Russian painters of his time. The illegitimate son of a
woman</p>
<p>68 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>serf, he was adopted by her husband, was freed, and found his way,
helped by accidents, into the Academy of Fine Arts. One of his first and
best por- traits was of his adoptive father, painted in 1804, when the
artist was only twenty-two; it seems incredible that one so young should
have reached both the understanding and the mastery to see and convey in
one portrait the strength of body and character that made Suvorov and
Kutuzov, and that led the victorious Russians from Moscow to Paris in
1812-13. Entirely dif- ferent is Kiprensky’s portrait (1827) of the poet
Pushkin— handsome, sensi- tive, questioning, with a dozen masterpieces
in his head. Again unique is the full-length picture (1809) of the
cavalry officer Evgraf Davidov — gorgeous uniform, proud mien, one hand
on his sword as the supreme court. And in 1813, in a quite different
world, the portrait of young Aleksandr Pavlovich Bakunin — no known
relation to the Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bakunin who, a generation later,
harried Karl Marx with different absolutes, and founded the Nihilist
movement in Russia. Kiprensky himself was something of a rebel,
sympathized with the “Decembrist” rising in 1825, was marked as a social
rebel, and sought safety in Florence, where the Uffizi Gallery had asked
him for a self-portrait. He died in Italy in 1836, leaving it to later
generations of Russians to recognize him as the greatest Russian painter
of his time.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>RUSSIAN LITERATURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Russian literature had both blossomed and decayed under Catherine the
Great. Seldom had a ruler shown so enthusiastic a surrender to a foreign
culture, or made so visible a conquest of its living leaders, as in her
love affair with the Enlightenment, and her adroit conscription of
Voltaire, Diderot and Friedrich Melchior von Grimm as eloquent defenders
of Russia in France and Germany. But then the Revolution came, all
thrones trembled, and the gods of the Illumination were discarded as
godfathers of the guillo- tine. The Russian court still spoke
eighteenth-century French, but Russian writers proclaimed the beauty of
the Russian language, and some, according to Mme. de Stael, “applied the
epithets deaf and dumb to persons ignorant of the Russian tongue.” 35 A
mighty quarrel arose, and became a national duel, between the admirers
of foreign models in literature and life and the up- holders of native
morals, manners, subjects, speech, and styles. This “Slavo - phil”
spirit was an understandable and necessary self -assertion of the
national mind and character; it opened the way for the flood of Russian
literary genius in the nineteenth century. It derived considerable
stimulus from the wars of Alexander and Napoleon.</p>
<p>Alexander himself symbolized the conflict through his own spirit and
history. He was highly sensitive to beauty in nature and art, in woman
and himself. He recognized in art the double miracle of duration given
to passing loveliness or character, and of illuminating significance
elicited from indis - criminate reality. The influence of La Harpe and a
Francophile court made</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>RUSSIA</p>
<p>685</p>
<p>he grandson of German Catherine a gentleman rivaling any Gaul in man-
ners and education. He naturally supported the efforts of Karamzin and
others to import French graces and subtleties into Russian speech and
ways. His friendship with Napoleon (1807-10) supported this Westward
inclina- tion; his conflict with Napoleon (1811-15) touched his Russian
roots, and turned him to sympathy with Aleksandr Shiskov and the
Slavophils. In each of these moods the Czar encouraged authors by
pensions, sinecures, decora- tions, or gifts. He ordered governmental
printing of important contributions to literature, science, or history.
He subsidized translations of Adam Smith, Bentham, Beccaria, and
Montesquieu. When he learned that Karamzin wished to write a history of
Russia but feared that he would starve in the process, Alexander gave
him an annuity of two thousand rubles, and ordered the Treasury to
finance the publication of his volumes. 36</p>
<p>Nikolai Mikhailovich Karamzin (1766-1826) was the son of a Tatar
land- owner in the province of Simbirsk on the lower Volga. He received
a good education, learned German and French, and went well equipped for
his eighteen months of travel in Germany, Switzerland, France, and
England. Returning to Russia, he founded a monthly review, the Moskovsky
zhurnal, whose most attractive contents were his own Letters of a
Russian Traveler. His light and graceful style, describing not only
objects seen but the feelings aroused in him, revealed the influence of
Rousseau and the Russian tendency to sentiment. Karamzin went further on
the Romantic line in his novel Poor Lisa (1792): a peasant girl, seduced
and deserted, commits suicide. Though the tale made no pretense to be
more than fiction, the spot where Lisa drowned herself became a pond of
pilgrimage for Russian youths. 37</p>
<p>Karamzin made his mark in almost every literary field. His poems, un-
abashedly Romantic, found a large audience. As a critic he shocked the
Slavophils by importing French or English terms to replace what seemed,
to his traveled ear, clumsy, inaccurate, or cacophonous in Russian terms
or phrases. Shishkov denounced him as a traitor to his country. Karamzin
stood his ground, and won: he purified and expanded the Russian
language, recon- ciled it with music, and transmitted a cleansed and
sharpened instrument to Pushkin and Lermontov.</p>
<p>Karamzin prevailed for another reason: he practiced what he preached,
in twelve volumes constituting the first real History of Russia.
Financial help from the government enabled him to give almost all his
waking time to the task. He borrowed judiciously from early chroniclers,
warmed their cold facts with emotion, and graced the long story with a
clear and flowing style. When the first eight volumes appeared
(1816-18), in an edition of three thousand copies, they were sold out in
twenty-five days. It could not rival the histories of Voltaire, Hume, or
Gibbon; it was frankly patriotic, and saw absolute monarchy as the
proper government of a people fighting for its life against a merciless
climate and barbarian invaders, and forced to create law as it spread.
But it proved to be a precious mine of material for poets and novelists
of the succeeding generations; here, for example, Push- kin found the
story of Boris Godunov. It shared modestly with the repulse</p>
<p>686</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>of Napoleon from Moscow in raising the Russian spirit to play its
brilliant and unique part in the literature and music of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>Ivan Andreevich Krylov (1769-1844) was the Aesop, as Karamzin was the
Herodotus, of this Alexandrian spring. Son of a poor army officer, he
may have taken from military camps some of the racy speech and satirical
verve that sharpened his comedies nil they drew blood from the status
quo. When it silenced him he withdrew from literature into more
practical pur- suits — tutor, secretary, professional card player,
gambler… Then, in 1 809, he issued a book of fables which set all
literate Russia laughing at all man- kind except the reader. Some of
these stories, as fables often do, echoed earlier fabulists, notably La
Fontaine. Most of them — through the mouths of lions, elephants, crows,
and other philosophers — expounded popular wisdom in popular language
cut into ambling iambic verses of any convenient length. Krylov had
rediscovered the secret of the great fabulist — that the only
intelligible wisdom is that of the peasant, and its art is to find the
ego behind the sham. Krylov exposed the vices, stupidity, wiles, and
venality of men, and reckoned satire to be as good a tutor as a month in
jail. Since only an exceptional reader thought that the story was about
himself, the public bought the little volume eagerly — forty thousand
copies in ten years — in a land where the ability to read was a proud
distinction. Krylov tapped the vein periodically by publishing nine more
volumes of fables between 1809 and 1843. The government, grateful for
the general conservatism of Krylov, gave him a supporting post in the
public library. He held it, lazy and content, till, one day in his
seventy-fifth year, he ate too many part- ridges and died. 38</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>ALEXANDER AND NAPOLEON: 1805-12</li>
</ol>
<p>They came to power almost at the same time, and both by violence: Na-
poleon on November 9, 1799, Alexander on March 24, 1801. Their nearness
in time overcame their separation in space: like two opposed forces in a
cell, they expanded in power till they tore Europe apart, first at
Austerlitz with war, then at Tilsit with peace. They were rivals for
Turkey, because</p>
<p>each thought of mastering the Continent, with Constantinople as its
key; each took turns in courting Poland because it was a strategic
bridge between East and West; the war of 1812-13 was f° u ght to decide
which of the two was to master Europe and perhaps conquer India.</p>
<p>Alexander, a youth of twenty-four, facing in 1801 a bedlam of Powers
old in chicanery, wavered in his foreign policy but repeatedly extended
his rule. He alternated between war and peace with Turkey, annexed
Georgia in 1801 and Alaska in 1803, allied Russia with Prussia in 1802,
with Austria in 1804, with England in 1805. In 1804 his Minister for
Foreign Affairs drew up for him a plan for partitioning the Ottoman
Empire. 39 He admired Na- poleon’s work as consul, d enounced him for
the summary execution of the Due d’Enghien, joined Austria and Prussia
in a disastrous war against the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) RUSSIA 687</p>
<p>usurper (1805-06), met and kissed him at Tilsit (1807), and agreed
with him that half of Europe was enough for each of them until further
notice.</p>
<p>Each left Tilsit confident that he had won a great diplomatic
victory. Na- poleon had persuaded the Czar to drop England and take
France as his ally, and to enforce the Continental Blockade against
British goods. Alexander, left defenseless by the shattering of his main
army at Friedland, had saved his realm from a ruinous invasion by
abandoning one ally for a stronger one, and securing a free hand with
Sweden and Turkey. Napoleon’s army and capital applauded his military
and diplomatic triumphs. Alexander, on re- turning to St. Petersburg,
found nearly everyone — family, court, nobility, clergy, merchants, and
populace — shocked that he had signed a humiliating peace with an
upstart bandit atheist. Some writers — like F. N. Glinka and Count
Feodor Rostopchin (the future governor of Moscow) — published arti- cles
explaining that the Peace of Tilsit was only a truce, and promising that
the war against Napoleon would be resumed at a suitable opportunity, and
would be carried on to his final destruction. 40</p>
<p>The business class joined in condemning the peace, since it meant,
for them, Russia’s enforcement of the Continental Blockade. The sale of
Rus - sian products to Britain, and the import of British goods into
Russia, had been vital elements in their prosperity; the prohibition of
such trade would ruin many of them, and would disrupt the national
economy. And indeed the Russian government neared bankruptcy in 1 8 1
o.</p>
<p>Alexander lost confidence, and hardened his rule. He restored
censorship of speech and press, and abandoned his plans of reform. His
liberal ministers — Kochubey, Czartoryski, Novosiltsov — resigned, and
two of them left Rus- sia. Then, in 1809, in a final attempt to free
himself from the currents of conservatism that were rising around him,
he took as his favorite adviser an almost reckless reformer who proposed
that the Czar submit to a constitu- tional government.</p>
<p>Count Mikhail Mikhailovich Speransky had begun life in 1772 as the
son of a village priest. He developed a fondness for science, and had
risen to be professor of mathematics and physics in a St. Petersburg
seminary when his work drew the attention of Czarevich Alexander. In 1
802 he was assigned to the Ministry of the Interior, then under the
reformer Kochubey. There he showed such capacity for hard work and
intelligible reports that the Czar assigned him to direct the
codification of Russian laws. When Alexander set out for his second
meeting with Napoleon in 1 808 he took Speranksy with him as “the only
clear head in Russia.” 41 An uncertain story relates that when Alexander
asked him what he thought of the states then under Napo- leon’s control,
Speranksy made the perceptive reply “We have better men, but they have
better institutions.” 42 Returning to St. Petersburg, the Czar gave his
new favorite more and more power, until they found themselves
contemplating a general reconstruction of the Russian government.</p>
<p>Speranksy wanted to end serfdom, but confessed that it could not be
done in 1809. However, perhaps remembering a similar move by Stein in
Prussia, he proposed a preparatory decree permitting all classes to buy
land. The next</p>
<p>688</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>step, he suggested, would be the election, by all property owners in
each volost (township), of a local duma (council), which would control
town finances, appoint local officials, and elect delegates — and submit
recom- mendations — to a district duma; this would appoint district
officials, propose district policies, and send delegates and
recommendations to a provincial duma, which would send delegates and
recommendations to a national duma in St. Petersburg. Only the czar
would have the authority to determine laws, but the national duma would
have the right to suggest laws for his considera- tion. Between the duma
and the ruler an advisory council appointed by him would aid him in
administration and legislation.</p>
<p>Alexander gave the plan a general approval, but he was hampered by
other powers in the state. The nobility felt itself endangered; it
distrusted Speranksy as a commoner, accused him of partiality for the
Jews 43 and ad- miration for Napoleon, and insinuated to Alexander that
his ambitious Min- ister was aiming to be the power behind the throne.
The bureaucracy joined in the attack, largely because Speranksy had
persuaded the Czar to issue a decree (August 6, 1809) requiring a
university degree, or the passing of a strict examination, for
eligibility to the higher administrative offices. Alex- ander was
sufficiently influenced to allow that the international situation did
not allow of substantial experiments in the government.</p>
<p>His relations with France had been soured by Napoleon’s marriage with
an Austrian Archduchess, and his seizure (January 22, 1811) of the duchy
of Oldenburg, whose Duke was father-in- law to the Czar’s sister.
Napoleon explained that the Duke had refused to close his ports to
British goods, and that compensation had been offered him. 44 Alexander
did not like Na- poleon’s establishment of a grand duchy of Warsaw so
close to formerly Polish territory appropriated by Russia; he feared
that at any time Napoleon would revive a kingdom of Poland hostile to
Russia. He decided that to se- cure the unity of ms country behind him
he must make concessions to the nobility and the merchants.</p>
<p>He knew that British goods — or goods from British colonies — were
being admitted into Russia under papers forged by Russian traders or
officials, cer- tifying that the material was American and therefore
admissible; Alexander allowed it; and part of it passed through Russia
into Prussia and other coun- tries. 45 Napoleon, through the Russian
minister in Paris, sent an angry protest to the Czar. Alexander, by a
decree of December 31, 1810, sanctioned the entry of British colonial
goods, lowered the tariff on them, and raised the tariff on goods from
France. In February, 181 1, Napoleon sent him a plain- tive letter:
“Your Majesty n o longer has any friendship for me; in the eyes of
England and Europe our alliance no longer exists.” 46 Alexander made no
answer, but mobilized 240,000 troops at various points on his western
front. 47 According to Caulaincourt he had, as early as May, 18 11,
resigned himself to war: “It is possible, and even probable, that
Napoleon will defeat us, but that will not bring him peace…. We have
vast spaces into which to retreat…. We shall leave it to our climate, to
our winter, to wage our war…. I shall withdraw to Kamchatka rather than
cede any of my possessions.” 48</p>

<p>He agreed now with the English diplomats in St. Petersburg, and with
Stein and other Prussian refugees at his court, who had long since been
tell- ing him that Napoleon’s purpose was to subdue all Europe to his
rule. To unify the nation Alexander abandoned the reforms, and proposals
for re- form, that were alienating from him the most influential
families; even the common people, he felt, were not ready for them. On
March 29, 1812, he dismissed Speranksy not only from office, but from
the court, from St. Petersburg, and gave ear more and more to the
conservative Count Aleksei Arakcheev. In April he signed a treaty with
Sweden, agreeing to favor the Swedish claim to Norway. He sent secret
orders to his representatives in the south to make peace with Turkey,
even at the cost of surrendering all Rus- sian claims to Moldavia and
Wallachia; all Russian armies must be available for defense against
Napoleon. Turkey signed peace on May 28.</p>
<p>Alexander knew that he was risking everything, but he had been
turning more and more to religion as a support in these days of strain
and decision. He prayed, and daily read the Bible. He found comfort and
strength in feeling that his cause was just, and would receive divine
aid. He saw Napo- leon now as the principle and embodiment of evil, as a
power-mad anarch marching insatiably from power to more power. Only he,
Alexander, backed by a God-intoxicated people and a God-given immensity
of space, could stop this ravaging devil, save the independence and
ancient order of Europe, and bring the nations back from Voltaire to
Christ.</p>
<p>On April 21, 1812, he left St. Petersburg, accompanied by the leaders
of his government and escorted by the prayers of his people, and
traveled south to Vilna, capital of Russian Lithuania. He arrived there
on April 26; and there, with one of his armies, he waited for
Napoleon.</p>
