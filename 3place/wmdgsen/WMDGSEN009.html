<p>Egypt</p>
<p>I. THE GIFT OF THE NILE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the Delta</li>
</ol>
<p>Alexandria — The Nile — The Pyramids — The Sphinx</p>
<p>T HIS is a perfect harbor. Outside the long breakwater the waves</p>
<p>topple over one another roughly; within it the sea is a silver
mirror.</p>
<p>There, on the little island of Pharos, when Egypt was very old,
Sostratus built his great lighthouse of white marble, five hundred feet
high, as a beacon to all ancient mariners of the Mediterranean, and as
one of the seven wonders of the world. Time and the nagging waters have
washed it away, but a new lighthouse has taken its place, and guides the
steamer through the rocks to the quays of Alexandria. Here that
astonishing boy- statesman, Alexander, founded the subtle, polyglot
metropolis that was to inherit the culture of Egypt, Palestine and
Greece. In this harbor Caesar received without gladness the severed head
of Pompey.</p>
<p>As the train glides through the city, glimpses come of unpaved alleys
and streets, heat waves dancing in the air, workingmen naked to the
waist, black-garbed women bearing burdens sturdily, white-robed and
turbaned Moslems of regal dignity, and in the distance spacious squares
and shining palaces, perhaps as fair as those that the Ptolemies built
when Alexandria was the meeting-place of the world. Then suddenly it is
open country, and the city recedes into the horizon of the fertile Delta
— that green triangle which looks on the map like the leaves of a lofty
palm-tree held up on the slender stalk of the Nile.</p>
<p>Once, no doubt, this Delta was a bay; patiently the broad stream
filled it up, too slowly to be seen, with detritus carried down a
thousand</p>
<p>miles;* now from this little corner of mud, enclosed by the many
mouths of the river, six million peasants grow enough cotton to export a
hundred million dollars’ worth of it every year. There, bright and calm
under the</p>
<ul>
<li>Even the ancient geographers (e.g., Strabo 1 ) believed that Egypt
had once been under the waters of the Mediterranean, and that its
deserts had been the bottom of the sea.</li>
</ul>
<p>*37</p>
<p>1 38 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>glaring sun, fringed with slim palms and grassy banks, is the most
famous of all rivers. We cannot see the desert that lies so close beyond
it, or the great empty wadir — river-beds — where once its fertile
tributaries flowed; we cannot realize yet how precariously narrow a
thing this Egypt is, owing everything to the river, and harassed on
either side with hostile, shifting sand.</p>
<p>Now the train passes amid the alluvial plain. The land is half
covered with water, and crossed everywhere with irrigation canals. In
the ditches and the fields black fellaheen* labor, knowing no garment
but a cloth about the loins. The river has had one of its annual
inundations, which begin at the summer solstice and last for a hundred
days; through that over- flow the desert became fertile, an d Egypt
blossomed, in Herodotus’ phrase, as the “gift of the Nile.” It is clear
why civilization found here one of</p>
<p>its earliest homes; nowhere else was a river so generous in
irrigation, and so controllable in its rise; only Mesopotamia could
rival it. For thousands of years the peasants have watched this rise
with anxious eagerness; to this day public criers announce its progress
each morning in the streets of Cairo. 2 So the past, with the quiet
continuity of this river, flows into the future, lightly touching the
present on its way. Only historians make divisions; time does not.</p>
<p>But every gift must be paid for; and the peasant, though he valued
the rising waters, knew that without control they could ruin as well as
irrigate his fields. So from time beyond history he built these ditches
that cross and recross the land; he caught the surplus in canals, and
when the river fell he raised the water with buckets pivoted on long
poles, singing, as he worked, the songs that the Nile has heard for five
thousand years. For as these peasants are now, sombre and laughterless
even in their singing, so they have been, in all likelihood, for fifty
centuries. 2 This water-raising apparatus is as old as the Pyramids; and
a million of these fellaheen, despite the conquests of Arabic, still
speak the language of the ancient monuments.* Here in the Delta, fifty
miles southeast of Alexandria, is the site o r</p>
<p>Naucratis, once filled with industrious, scheming Greeks; thirty
miles farther east, the site of Sa’is, where, in the centuries before
the Persian and Greek conquests, the native civilization of Egypt had
its last revival; and then, a hundred and twenty-nine miles southeast of
Alexandria, is Cairo. A beautiful city, but not Egyptian; the conquering
Moslems</p>
<p>Plural form of the Arabic fellah , peasant; from felaha , to
plough.</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>founded it in a.d. 968; then the bright spirit of France overcame the
gloomy Arab and built here a Paris in the desert, exotic and unreal. One
must pass through it by motorcar or leisurely fiacre to find old Egypt
at the Pyramids.</p>
<p>How small they appear from the long road that approaches them; did we
come so far to see so little? But then they grow larger, as if they were
being lifted up into the air; round a turn in the road we surprise the
edge of the desert; and there suddenly the Pyramids confront us, bare
and solitary in the sand, gigantic and morose against an Italian sky. A
motley crowd scrambles about their base — stout business men on blinking
donkeys, stouter ladies secure in carts, young men prancing on
horseback, young women sitting uncomfortably on camel-back, their silk
knees glistening in the sun; and everywhere grasping Arabs. We stand
where Caesar and Napoleon stood, and remember that fifty centuries look
down upon us; where the Father of History came four hundred years before
Caesar, and heard the tales that were to startle Pericles. A new
perspective of time comes to us; two millenniums seem to fall out of the
picture, and Caesar, Herodotus and ourselves appear for a moment
contemporary and modern before these tombs that were more ancient to
them than the Greeks are to us.</p>
<p>Nearby, the Sphinx, half lion and half philosopher, grimly claws
the</p>
<p>sand, and glares unmoved at the transient visitor and the eternal
plain. It is a savage monument, as if designed to frighten old lechers
and make children retire early. The lion body passes into a human head
with</p>
<p>prognathous jaws and cruel eyes; the civilization that built it (ca.
2990 b.c.) had not quite forgotten barbarism. Once the sand covered it,
and Herodotus, who saw so much that is not there, says not a word of
it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what wealth these old Egyptians must have had, what
power and skill, even in the infancy of history, to bring these vast
stones six hundred miles, to raise some of them, weighing many tons, to
a height of half a thousand feet, and to pay, or even to feed, the
hundred thousand slaves who toiled for twenty years on these Pyramids!
Herodotus has preserved for us an inscription that he found on one
pyramid, record- ing the quantity of radishes, garlic and onions
consumed by the workmen who built it; these things, too, had to have
their immortality.* Despite</p>
<ul>
<li>Diodorus Siculus, who mu st always be read sceptically, writes: “An
inscription on the larger pyramid . . . sets forth that on vegetables
and purgatives for the workmen there were paid out over 1600 talents”—
i.e M ,ooo,ooo. 5</li>
</ul>
<p>140 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>these familiar friends we go away disappointed; there is something
bar- barically primitive — or barbarically modern — in this brute hunger
for size. It is the memory and imagination of the beholder that, swollen
with history, make these monuments great; in themselves they are a
little ridiculous — vainglorious tombs in which the dead sought eternal
life. Perhaps pictures have too much ennobled them: photography can
catch everything but dirt, and enhances man-made objects with noble
vistas of land and sky. The sunset at Gizeh is greater than the
Pyramids.</p>

<p>Memphis — The masterpiece of Queen Hatshepsut —The “ Colossi</p>
<p>of Memnon”— Luxor and Kamak — The grandeur of Egyp-</p>
<p>tian civilization</p>
<p>From Cairo a little steamer moves up the river — i.e., southward —
through six leisurely days to Kamak and Luxor. Twenty miles below Cairo
it</p>
<p>passes Memphis, the most ancient of Egypt’s capitals. Here, where the
great Third and Fourth Dynasties lived, in a city of two million souls,
nothing now greets the eye but a row of small pyramids and a grove of
palms; for the rest there is only desert, infinite, villainous sand,
slipping under the feet, stinging the eyes, filling the pores, covering
everything, stretching from Morocco across Sinai, Arabia, Turkestan,
Tibet to Mon- golia: along that sandy belt across two continents
civilization once built its seats and now is gone, driven away, as the
ice receded, by increasing heat and decreasing rain. By the Nile, for a
dozen miles on either side, runs a ribbon of fertile soil; from the
Mediterranean to Nubia there is only this strip redeemed from the
desert. This is the thread upon which hung the life of Egypt. And yet
how brief seems the life-span of Greece, or the millennium of Rome,
beside the long record from Menes to Cleopatra!</p>
<p>A week later the steamer is at Luxor. On this site, now covered with
Arab hamlets or drifting sand, once stood the greatest of Egypt’s
capitals, the richest city of the very ancient world, known to the
Greeks as Thebes, and to its own people as Wesi and Ne. On the eastern
slope of the Nile is the famous Winter Palace of Luxor, aflame with
bougainvillea; across the river the sun is setting over the Tombs of the
Kings into a sea of sand, and the sky is flaked with gaudy tints of
purple and gold. Far in the west the pillars of Queen Hatshepsut’s noble
temple gleam, looking for all the world like some classic colonnade.</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>In the morning lazy sailboats ferry the seeker across a river so
quiet</p>
<p>and unpretentious that no one would suspect that it had been flowing
here for uncounted centuries. Then over mile after mile of desert,
through dusty mountain passes and by historic graves, until the
masterpiece of the great Queen rises still and white in the trembling
heat. Here the artist decided to transform nature and her hills into a
beauty greater than her own: into the very face of the granite cliff he
built these columns, as stately as those that Ictinus made for Pericles;
it is impossible, seeing these, to doubt that Greece took her
architecture, perhaps through Crete, from this initiative race. And on
the walls vast bas-reliefs, alive with motion and thought, tell the
story of the first great woman in history, and not the least of
queens.</p>
<p>On the road back sit two giants in stone, representing the most
luxurious of Egypt’s monarchs, Amenhotep III, but mistakenly called the
“Colossi of Memnon” by the Baedekers of Greece. Each is seventy feet
high,</p>
<p>weighs seven hundred tons, and is carved out of a single rock. On the
base of one of them are the inscriptions left by Greek tourists who
visited these ruins two thousand years ago; again the centuries fall out
of reckon- ing, and those Greeks seem strangely contemporary with us in
the presence of these ancient things. A mile to the north lie the stone
remains of</p>
<p>Rameses II, one of the most fascinating figures in history, beside
whom Alexander is an immature trifle; alive for ninety-nine years,
emperor for sixty-seven, father of one hundred and fifty children; here
he is a statue, once fifty-six feet high, now fifty-six feet long,
prostrate and ridiculous in the sand. Napoleon’s savants measured him
zealously; they found his ear three</p>
<p>All around now, on the west bank of the Nile, is the City of the
Dead. At every turn some burrowing Egyptologist has unearthed a royal
tomb. The grave of Tutenkhamon is closed, locked even in the faces of
those who thought that gold would open anything; but the tomb of Seti I
is open, and there in the cool earth one may gaze at decorated ceilings
and passages, and marvel at the wealth and skill that could build such
sarcophagi and surround them with such art. In one of these tombs the
excavators saw, on the sand, the footprints of the slaves who had
carried the mummy to its place three thousand years before.*</p>
<p>I4 2 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>But the best remains adorn the eastern side of the river. Here at
Luxor the lordly Amenhotep III, with the spoils of Thutmose Ill’s
victories,</p>
<p>began to build his most pretentious edifice; death came upon him as
he built; then, after the work had been neglected for a century, Rameses
II finished it in regal style. At once the quality of Egyptian
architecture floods the spirit: here are scope and power, not beauty
merely, but a masculine sublimity. A wide court, now waste with sand,
paved of old with marble; on three sides majestic colonnades matched by
Karnak alone; on every hand carved stone in bas-relief, and royal
statues proud even in desolation. Imagine eight long stems of the
papyrus plant — nurse of letters and here the form of art; at the base
of the fresh unopened flowers bind the stems with five firm bands that
will give beauty strength; then picture the whole stately stalk in
stone: this is the papyriform column of Luxor. Fancy a court of such
columns, upholding massive entablatures and shade- giving porticoes; see
the whole as the ravages of thirty centuries have left it; then estimate
the men who, in what we once thought the childhood of civilization,
could conceive and execute such monuments.</p>
<p>Through ancient ruins and modern squalor a rough footpath leads to
what Egypt keeps as its final offering — the temples of Karnak. Half a
hundred Pharaohs took part in building them, from the last dynasties of
the Old Kingdom to the days of the Ptolemies; generation by generation
the structures grew, until sixty acres were covered with the lordliest
offerings that architecture ever made to the gods. An “Avenue of</p>
<p>Sphinxes” leads to the place where Champollion, founder of
Egyptology, stood in 1828 and wrote:</p>
<p>I went at last to the palace, or rather to the city of monuments
—</p>
<p>to Karnak. There all the magnificence of the Pharaohs appeared to</p>
<p>me, all that men have imagined and executed on the grandest
scale.</p>
<p>. . . No people, ancient or modern, has conceived the art of
archi-</p>
<p>tecture on a scale so sublime, so great, so grandiose, as the
ancient</p>
<p>Egyptians. They conceived like men a hundred feet high.’</p>
<p>To understand it would require maps and plans, and all an architect’s
learning. A spacious enclosure of many courts one-third of a mile on
each side; a population of once 86,000 statues; 8 a main group of
buildings, constituting the Temple of Amon, one thousand by three
hundred feet; great pylons or gates between one court and the next; the
perfect “Heral dic</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>x 43</p>
<p>Pillars” of Thutmose III, broken off rudely at the top, but still of
astonish - ingly delicate carving and design; the Festival Hall of the
same formidable monarch, its fluted shafts here and there anticipating
all the power of the Doric column in Greece; the little Temple of Ptah,
with graceful pillars rivaling the living palms beside them; the
Promenade, again the work of Thutmose’s builders, with bare and massive
colonnades, symbol of Egypt’s Napoleon; above all, the Hypostyle Hall,*
a very forest of one hundred and forty gigantic columns, crowded close
to keep out the exhausting sun, flowering out at their tops into
spreading palms of stone, and holding up, with impressive strength, a
roof of mammoth slabs stretched in solid granite from capital to
capital. Nearby two slender obelisks, monoliths complete in symmetry and
grace, rise like pillars of light amid the ruins of statues and temples,
and announce in their inscriptions the proud message of Queen Hatshepsut
to the world. These obelisks, the carv- ing says,</p>
<p>are of hard granite from the quarries of the South; their tops
are</p>
<p>of fine gold chosen from the best in all foreign lands. They can
be</p>
<p>seen from afar on the river; the splendor of their radiance fills
the</p>
<p>Two Lands, and when the solar disc appears between them it is</p>
<p>truly as if he rose up into the horizon of the sky. … You who
after</p>
<p>long years shall see these monuments, who shall speak of what I</p>
<p>have done, you will say, “We do not know, we do not know how</p>
<p>they can have made a whole mountain of gold.” … To guild them</p>
<p>I have given gold measured by the bushel, as though it were sacks</p>
<p>of grain, . . . for I knew that Kamak is the celestial horizon of
the</p>
<p>earth.*</p>
<p>What a queen, and what kings! Perhaps this first great civilization
was the finest of all, and we have but begun to uncover its glory? Near
the Sacred Lake at Kamak men are digging, carrying away the soil
patiently in little paired baskets slung over the shoulder on a pole; an
Egyptologist is bending absorbed over hieroglyphics on two stones just
rescued from the earth; he is one of a thousand such men, Carters and
Breasteds and Masperos, Petries and Caparts and Weigalls, living simply
here in the heat and dust, trying to read for us the riddle of the
Sphinx, to snatch from the secretive soil the art and literature, the
history and wisdom of Egypt.</p>

York.</li>

<p>(chap, vni</p>
<p>Every day the earth and the elements fight against them; superstition
curses and hampers them; moisture and corrosion attack the very monu-
ments they have exhumed; and the same Nile that gives food to Egypt
creeps in its overflow into the ruins of Kamak, loosens the pillars,
tumbles them down,* and leaves upon them, when it subsides, a deposit of
saltpetre that eats like a leprosy into the stone.</p>
<p>Let us contemplate the glory of Egypt once more, in her history and
her civilization, before her last monuments crumble into the sand.</p>

<li>The Discovery of Egypt</li>
</ol>
<p>Champollion and the Rosetta Stone</p>
<p>The recovery of Egypt is one of the most brilliant chapters in
arche-</p>
<p>ology. The Middle Ages knew of Egypt as a Roman colony and a Chris-
tian settlement; the Renaissance presumed that civilization had begun
with Greece; even the Enlightenment, though it concerned itself
intelligently with China and India, knew nothing of Egypt beyond the
Pyramids. Egyp- tology was a by-product of Napoleonic imperialism. When
the great Cor- sican led a French expedition to Egypt in 1798 he took
with him a number of draughtsmen and engineers to explore and map the
terrain, and made place also for certain scholars absurdly interested in
Egypt for the sake of a better understanding of history. It was this
corps of men who first re- vealed the temples of Luxor and Kamak to the
modern world; and the elaborate Description de UEgypte (1809-13) which
they prepared for the French Academy was the first milestone in the
scientific study of this for- gotten civilization. 10</p>
<p>For many years, however, they were unable to read the inscriptions
sur- viving on the monuments. Typical of the scientific temperament was
the patient devotion with which Champollion, one of these savants,
applied himself to the decipherment of the hieroglyphics. He found at
last an obelisk covered with such “sacred carvings” in Egyptian, but
bearing at the base a Greek inscription which indicated that the writing
concerned Ptolemy and Cleopatra. Guessing that two hieroglyphics often
repeated, with a royal cartouche attached, were the names of these
rulers, he made out tentatively (1822) eleven Egyptian letters; this was
the first proof that Egypt had had</p>

fell to the</li>

<p>145</p>
<p>an alphabet. Then he applied this alphabet to a great black stone
slab that Napoleon’s troops had stumbled upon near the Rosetta mouth of
the Nile. T his “Rosetta Stone”* contained an inscription in three
languages: first in hieroglyphics, second in “demotic”— the popular
script of the Egyptians — and third in Greek. With his knowledge of
Greek, and the eleven letters made out from the obelisk, Champollion,
after more than twenty years of labor, deciphered the whole inscription,
discovered the entire Egyptian alphabet, and opened the way to the
recovery of a lost world. It was one of the peaks in the history of
history.+ u</p>

<p>Since the radicals of one age are the reactionaries of the next, it
was not to be expected that the men who created Egyptology should be the
first to accept as authentic the remains of Egypt’s Old Stone Age; after

hesitant with figures, classed them as the work of post-dynastic
generations; and Maspero, whose lordly erudition did no hurt to his
urbane and polished style, ascribed neo- lithic Egyptian pottery to the
Middle Kingdom. Nevertheless, in 1895 De Morgan revealed an almost
continuous gradation of paleolithic cultures — corresponding
substantially with their succession in Europe — in the flint hand-axes,
harpoons, arrow-heads and hammers exhumed all along the Nile. 13
Imperceptibly the paleolithic remains graduate into neolithic at depths
indicating an age 10,000-4000 b.c. 1 * The stone tools become more
refined, and reach indeed a level of sharpness, finish and precision
unequaled by any other neolithic culture known. 15 Towards the end of
the period metal work enters in the form of vases, chisels and pins of
copper, and ornaments of silver and gold. 18</p>
<p>Finally, as a transition to history, agriculture appears. In the year
1901, near the little town of Badari (half way between Cairo and
Karnak), bodies were excavated amid implements indicating a date
approximating to forty centuries before Christ. In the intestines of
these bodies, preserved through six millenniums by the dry heat of the
sand, were husks of unconsumed barley. 17 Since barley does not grow
wild in Egypt, it is presumed that the Badarians had learned to
cultivate cereals. From that early age the in-</p>

<p>habitants of the Nile valley began the work of irrigation, cleared
the jungles and the swamps, won the river from the crocodile and the

<p>These and other remains give us-some inkling of Egyptian life before
the first of the historic dynasties. It was a culture midway between
hunting and agriculture, and just beginning to replace stone with metal
tools. The peo- ple made boats, ground corn, wove linen and carpets, had
jewels and per- fumes, barbers and domesticated animals, and delighted
to draw pictures, chiefly of the prey they pursued. 18 They painted upon
their simple pottery figures of mourning women, representations of
animals and men, and ge- ometrical designs; and they carved such
excellent products as the Gebel-el- Arak knife. They had pictographic
writing, and Sumerian-like cylinder seals. 10</p>
<p>No one knows whence these early Egyptians came. Learned guesses in-
cline to the view that they were a cross between Nubian, Ethiopian and
Libyan natives on one side and Semitic or Armenoid immigrants on the
other; 20 even at that date there were no pure races on the earth.
Probably the invaders or immigrants from Western Asia brought a higher
culture with them, 21 and their intermarriage with the vigorous native
stocks provided that ethnic blend which is often the prelude to a new
civilization. Slowly, from 4000 to 3000 b.c., these mingling groups
became a people, and created the Egypt of history.</p>

<p>Mummification</p>
<p>Already, by 4000 b.c., these peoples of the Nile had forged a
form</p>
<p>of government. The population along the river was divided into
“nomes,”* in each of which the inhabitants were essentially of one
stock, acknowl- edged the same totem, obeyed the same chief, and
worshiped the same gods by the same rites. Throughout the history of
ancient Egypt these nomes persisted, their “nomarchs” or rulers having
more or less power and autonomy according to the weakness or strength of
the reigning Pharaoh. As all developing structures tend toward an
increasing inter- dependence of the parts, so in this case the growth of
trade and the rising</p>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>costliness of war forced the nomes to organize themselves into two
king- doms — one in the south, one in the north; a division probably
reflecting the conflict between African natives and Asiatic immigrants.
This danger- ous accentuation of geographic and ethnic differences was
resolved for a time when Menes, a half- legendary figure, brought the
“Two Lands” under his united power, promulgated a body of laws given him
by the god Thoth, 33 established the first historic dynasty, built a new
capital at Memphis, “taught the people” (in the words of an ancient
Greek historian) “to use tables and couches, and . . . introduced luxury
and an extravagant manner of life.” 23</p>
<p>The first real person in known history is not a conqueror or a king
but an artist and a scientist — Imhotep, physician, architect and chief
adviser of King Zoser (ca. 3150 b.c.). He did so much for Egyptian
medicine</p>
<p>that later generations worshiped him as a god of knowledge, author of
their sciences and their arts; and at the same time he appears to have
founded the school of architecture which provided the next dynasty with
the first great builders in history. It was under his administration,
accord- ing to Egyptian tradition, that the first stone house was built;
it was he who planned the oldest Egyptian structure extant — the
Step-Pyramid of Sakkara, a terraced structure of stone which for
centuries set the style in tombs; and apparently it was he who designed
the funerary temple of Zoser, with its lovely lotus columns and its
limestone paneled walls. 31 In these old remains at Sakkarah, at what is
almost the beginning of historic Egyptian art, we find fluted shafts as
fair as any that Greece would build, 35 reliefs full of realism and
vitality, 33 green faience — richly colored glazed earthenware —
rivaling the products of medieval Italy, 37 and a power- ful stone
figure of King Zoser himself, obscured in its details by the blows of
time, but still revealing an astonishingly subtle and sophisticated
face. 38</p>
<p>We do not know what concourse of circumstance made the Fourth</p>
<p>Dynasty the most important in Egyptian history before the Eighteenth.
Perhaps it was the lucrative mining operations in the last reign of the
Third, perhaps the ascendancy of Egyptian merchants in Mediterranean
trade, perhaps the brutal energy of Khufu,* first Pharaoh of the new
house. Herodotus has passed on to us the traditions of the Egyp tian
priests conce rning this builder of the first of Gizeh’s pyramids:</p>
<p>The “Cheops” of Herodotus, r. 3098 -75 b.c.</p>
<p>148 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Now they tell me that to the reign of Rhampsinitus there was a</p>
<p>perfect distribution of justice and that all Egypt was in a high
state</p>
<p>of prosperity; but that after him Cheops, coming to reign over</p>
<p>them, plunged into every kind of wickedness, for that, having
shut</p>
<p>up all the temples, … he ordered all the Egyptians to work for</p>
<p>himself. Some, accordingly, were appointed to draw stones from</p>
<p>the quarries in the Arabian mountains down to the Nile, others he</p>
<p>ordered to receive the stones when transported in vessels across the
river. . . . And they worked to the number of a hundred thousand</p>
<p>men at a time, each party during three months. The time during</p>
<p>which the people were thus harassed by toil lasted ten years on the
road which they constructed, and along which they drew the stones; a
work, in my opinion, not much less than the Pyramid. 2 *</p>
<p>Of his successor and rival builder, Khafre,* we know something almost
at first hand; for the diorite portrait which is among the treasures of
the Cairo Museum pictures him, if not as he looked, certainly as we
might conceive this Pharaoh of the second pyramid, who ruled Egypt
for</p>
<p>fifty-six years. On his head is the falcon, symbol of the royal
power; but even without that sign we should know that he was every inch
a king. Proud, direct, fearless, piercing eyes; a powerful nose and a
frame of reserved and quiet strength; it is evident that nature had long
since learned how to make men, and art had long since learned how to
represent them. Why did these men build pyramids? Their purpose was not
archi-</p>
<p>tectural but religious; the pyramids were tombs, lineally descended
from the most primitive of burial mounds. Apparently the Pharaoh
believed, like any commoner among his people, that every living body was
inhabited by a double, or ka, which need not die with the breath; and
that the ka would survive all the more completely if the flesh were
preserved against hunger, violence and decay. The pyramid, by its
height,! its form and its position, sought stability as a means to
deathlessness; and except for its square corners it took the natural
form that any homogeneous group of solids would take if allowed to fall
unimpeded to the earth. Again, it was to have permanence and strength;
therefore stones were piled up here with mad patience as if they had
grown by the wayside and had not been carried from quarries hun dreds of
miles away. In Khufu’s pyramid there</p>

<p>are two and a half million blocks, some of them weighing one hundred
and fifty tons, 30 all of them averaging two and a half tons; they cover
half a million square feet, and rise 481 feet into the air. And the mass
is solid; only a few blocks were omitted, to leave a secret passage way
for the carcass of the King. A guide leads the trembling visitor on all
fours into the cavernous mausoleum, up a hundred crouching steps to the
very heart of the pyramid; there in the damp, still center, buried in
darkness and secrecy, once rested the bones of Khufu and his queen. The
marble</p>
<p>sarcophagus of the Pharaoh is still in place, but broken and empty.
Even these stones could not deter human thievery, nor all the curses of
the gods.</p>
<p>Since the ka was conceived as the minute image of the body, it had to
be fed, clothed and served after the death of the frame. Lavatories were
provided in some royal tombs for the convenience of the departed soul;
and a funerary text expresses some anxiety lest the ka, for want of
food, should feed upon its own excreta .“ One suspects that Egyptian
burial customs, if traced to their source, would lead to the primitive
interment of a warrior’s weapons with his corpse, or to some institution
like the Hindu suttee — the burial of a man’s wives and slaves with him
that they may attend to his needs. This having proved irksome to the
wives and slaves, painters and sculptors were engaged to draw pictures,
carve bas- reliefs, and make statuettes resembling these aides; by a
magic formula, usually inscribed upon them, the carved or painted
objects would be quite as effective as the real ones. A man’s
descendants were inclined to be lazy and economical, and even if he had
left an endowment to cover the costs they were apt to neglect the rule
that religion originally put upon them of supplying the dead with
provender. Hence pictorial sub- stitutes were in any case a wise
precaution: they could provide the ka of the deceased with fertile
fields, plump oxen, innumerable servants and busy artisans, at an
attractively reduced rate. Having discovered this principle, the artist
accomplished marvels with it. One tomb picture shows a field being
ploughed, the next shows the grain being reaped or threshed, another the
bread being baked; one shows the bull copulating with the cow, another
the calf being born, another the grown cattle being slaugh- tered,
another the meat served hot on the dish. 33 A fine limestone bas-relief
in the tomb of Prince Rahotep portrays the dead man enjoying the varied
victuals on the table before him. 33 Never since has art done so much
for men</p>
<p>150 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Finally the ka was assured long life not only by burying the
cadaver</p>
<p>in a sarcophagus of the hardest stone, but by treating it to the most
pains- taking mummification. So well was this done that to this day bits
of hair and flesh cling to the royal skeletons. Herodotus vividly
describes the Egyptian embalmer’s art:</p>
<p>First they draw out the brains through the nostrils with an iron</p>
<p>hook, raking part of it out in this manner, the rest by the
infusion</p>
<p>of drugs. Then with a sharp stone they make an incision in the
side,</p>
<p>and take out all the bowels; and having cleansed the abdomen and</p>
<p>rinsed it with palm wine, they next sprinkle it with pounded per-</p>
<p>fume. Then, having filled the belly with pure myrrh, cassia and</p>
<p>other perfumes, they sew it up again; and when they have done this
they steep it in natron,* leaving it under for seventy days; for a</p>
<p>longer time than this it is not lawful to steep it. At the
expiration</p>
<p>of seventy days they wash the corpse, and wrap the whole body in</p>
<p>bandages of waxen cloth, smearing it with gum, which the Egyp-</p>
<p>tians commonly use instead of glue. After this the relations,
hav-</p>
<p>ing taken the body back again, make a wooden case in the shape of</p>
<p>a man, and having made it they enclose the body; and then, having</p>
<p>fastened it up, they store it in a sepulchral chamber, setting it
up-</p>
<p>right against the wall. In this manner they prepare the bodies
that</p>
<p>are embalmed in the most expensive way . 64</p>
<p>“All the world fears Time,” says an Arab proverb, “but Time fears the
Pyramids .” 86 However, the pyramid of Khufu has lost twenty feet of its
height, and all its ancient marble casing is gone; perhaps Time is only
leisurely with it. Beside it stands Khafre’s pyramid, a trifle smaller,
but still capped with the granite casing that once covered it all.
Humbly be- yond this squats the pyramid of Khafre’s successor Menkaure,t
covered not with granite but with shamefaced brick, as if to announce
that when men raised it the zenith of the Old Kingdom had passed. The
statues of Menkaure that have come down to us show him as a man more
refined and less forceful than Khafre.J Civilization, like life,

<p>The Feudal Age — The Twelfth Dynasty — The Hyksos Domination</p>
<p>Kings were never so plentiful as in Egypt. History lumps them
into</p>
<p>dynasties — monarchs of one line or family; but even then they burden
the memory intolerably.* One of these early Pharaohs, Pepi II, ruled
Egypt for ninety-four years (2738-2644 b.c.) — the longest reign in
history. When he died anarchy and dissolution ensued, the Pharaohs lost
control, and feudal barons ruled the nomes independently: this
alternation between centralized and decentralized power is one of the
cyclical rhythms of his- tory, as if men tired alternately of immoderate
liberty and excessive order. After a Dark Age of four chaotic centuries
a strong-willed Charlemagne arose, set things severely in order, changed
the capital from Memphis to Thebes, and under the title of Amenemhet I
inaugurated that Twelfth Dynasty during which all the arts, excepting
perhaps architecture, reached a height of excellence never equaled in
known Egypt before or again. Through an old inscription Amenemhet speaks
to us:</p>
<p>I was one who cultivated grain and loved the harvest god;</p>
<p>The Nile greeted me and every valley;</p>
<p>None was hungry in my years, none thirsted then;</p>
<p>Men dwelt in peace through that which I wrought, and conversed</p>
<p>of me.</p>
<p>His reward was a conspiracy among the Talleyrands and Fouches whom he
had raised to high office. He put it down with a mighty hand, but left
for his son, Polonius-like, a scroll of bitter counsel — an admirable
form ula for despotism, but a heavy price to pay for royalty:</p>

<p>This stem ruler, who seems to us so human across four thousand years,
established a system of administration that held for half a millennium.
Wealth grew again, and then art; Senusret I built a great canal from the
Nile to the Red Sea, repelled Nubian invaders, and erected great temples
at Heliopolis, Abydos, and Karnak; ten colossal seated figures of him
have cheated time, and litter the Cairo Museum. Another Senusret — the
Third — began the subjugation of Palestine, drove back the recurrent
Nubians, and raised a stele or slab at the southern frontier, “not from

</ol>
<p>The great queen — Thutmose 111 — The zenith of Egypt</p>
<p>Perhaps the invasion had brought another rejuvenation by the infusion
of fresh blood; but at the same time the new age marked the beginning of
a thousand-year struggle betwen Egypt and Western Asia. Thutmose I not
only consolidated the power of the new empire, but — on the ground that
western Asia must be controlled to prevent further interruptions —
invaded Syria, subjugated it from the coast to Carchemish, put it under
guard and tribute, and returned to Thebes laden with spoils and the
glory that always comes from the killing of men. At the end of his
thirty-year reign he raised his daughter Hatshepsut to partnership with
him on the throne. For a time her husband and step-brother ruled as
Thutmose II, and dying, named as his successor Thutmose III, son of
Thutmose I by a concubine .* 8 But Hatshepsut set this high-destined
youngster aside, assumed full royal powers, and proved herself a king in
everything but gender.</p>
<p>Even this exception was not conceded by her. Since sacred tradition
required that every Egyptian ruler should be a son of the great god
Amon, Hatshepsut arranged to be made at once male and divine. A
biography was invented for her by which Amon had descended upon
Hatshepsut’s mother Ahmasi in a flood of perfume and light; his
attentions had been gratefully received; and on his departure he had
announced that Ahmasi would give birth to a daughter in whom all the
valor and strength of the god would be made manifest on earth . 80 To
satisfy the prejudices of her people, and perhaps the secret desire of
her heart, the great Queen had herself represented on the monuments as a
bearded and breastless warrior; and though the inscriptions referred to
her with the feminine pronoun, they d id not hesitate to speak of her as
“Son of the Sun” and “Lord of the Two Lands.” When she appeared in
public she dressed in male garb, and wore a beard.“</p>
<p>She had a right to determine her own sex, for she became one of the
most successful and beneficen t of Egypt’s many rulers. She maintained
internal order without undue tyranny, and external peace without loss.
She organized a great expedition to Punt (presumably the eastern coast
of Africa), giving new markets to her merchants and new delicacies to
her people. She helped to beautify Karnak. raised there two majestic
obelisks,</p>

<p>built at Der-el-Bahri the stately temple which her father had
designed, and repaired some of the damage that had been done to older
temples by the Hyksos kings. “I have restored that which was in ruins,”
one of her proud inscriptions tells us; “I have raised up that which was
unfinished since the Asiatics were in the midst of the Northland,
overthrowing that which had been mad e.” 41 Finally she built for
herself a secret and ornate</p>
<p>For twenty-two years the Queen ruled in wisdom and peace; Thutmose
III followed with a reign of many wars. Syria took advantage of Hatshep-
sut’s death to revolt; it did not seem likely to the Syrians that
Thutmose, a lad of twenty-two, would be able to maintain the empire
created by his father. But Thutmose set off in the very year of his
accession, marched his army through Kantara and Gaza at twenty miles a
day, and confronted the rebel forces at Har-Megiddo (i.e., Mt. Megiddo),
a little town so strategically placed between the rival Lebanon ranges
on the road from Egypt to the Euphrates that it has been the Ar-mageddon
of countless wars from that day to General Allenby’s. In the same pass
where in 1918 the British defeated the Turks, Thutmose III, 3397 years
before, defeated the Syrians and their allies. Then Thutmose marched
victorious through western Asia, subduing, taxing and levying tribute,
and returned to Thebes in triumph six months after his departure.*
42</p>
<p>This was the first of fifteen campaigns in which the irresistible
Thutmose made Egypt master of the Mediterranean world. Not only did he
conquer, but he organized; everywhere he left doughty garrisons and
capable gov- ernors. The first man in known history to recognize the
importance of sea power, he built a fleet that kept the Near East
effectively in leash. The spoils that he seized became the foundation of
Egyptian art in the period of the Empire; the tribute that he drained
from Syria gave his people an epicurean ease, and created a new class of
artists who filled all Egypt with</p>

imperial government when we learn that on one occasion the treasury was
able to measure out nine thousand pounds of gold and silver alloy .“
Trade flour - ished in Thebes as never before; the temples groaned with
offerings; and at Karnak the lordly Promenade and Festival Hall rose to
the greater glory of god and king. Then the King retired from the
battlefield, designed exquisite vases, and gave himself to internal
administration. His vizier or prime minister said of him, as tired
secretaries were to say of Napoleon: “Lo, His Majesty was one wh o knew
what happened; there was nothing of which he was ignorant; he was the
god of knowledge in everything; there was no matter that he did not
carry out.” 43a He passed away after</p>
<p>After him another conqueror, Amenhotep II, subdued again certain</p>
<p>idolators of liberty in Syria, and returned to Thebes with seven
captive kings, still alive, hanging head downward from the prow of the
imperial galley; six of them he sacrificed to Amon with his own hand. 44
Then an- other Thutmose, who does not count; and in 1412 Amenhotep III
began a long reign in which the accumulated wealth of a century of
mastery brought Egypt to the acme of her splendor. A fine bust in the
British Museum shows him as a man at once of refinement and of strength,
able to hold firmly together the empire bequeathed to him, and yet
living in an atmosphere of comfort and elegance that might have been
envied by Petron ius or the Medici. Only the exhuming of Tutenkhamon’s
relics could make us credit the traditions and records of Amenhotep’s
riches and luxury. In his reign Thebes was as majestic as any city in
history. Her streets crowded with merchants, her markets filled with the
goods of the world, her buildings “surpassing in magnificence all those
of ancient or modern capitals,” 46 her imposing palaces receiving
tribute from an endless chain of vassal states, her massive temples
“enriched all over with gold” 46 and adorned with every art, her
spacious villas and costly chateaux, her shaded promenades and
artificial lakes providing the scene for sumptuous displays of fashion
that anticipated Imperial Rome 47 — such was Egypt’s capital in the days
of her glory, in the reign before her fall.</p>

<p>Behind these kings and queens were pawns; behind these temples, pal-
aces and pyramids were the workers of the cities and the peasants of the
fields.* Herodotus describes them optimistically as he found them about
450 B.C.</p>
<p>They gather in the fruits of the earth with less labor than any</p>
<p>other people, . . . for they have not the toil of breaking up the</p>
<p>furrow with the plough, nor of hoeing, nor of any other work</p>
<p>which all other men must labor at to obtain a crop of corn; but</p>
<p>when the river has come of its own accord and irrigated their fields,
and having irrigated them has subsided, then each man sows his own land
and turns his swine into it; and when the seed has been trod-</p>
<p>den into it by the swine he waits for harvest time; then … he</p>
<p>gathers it in.“</p>
<p>As the swine trod in the seed, so apes were tamed and taught to pluck
fruit from the trees.“ And the same Nile that irrigated the fields
deposited upon them, in its inundation, thousands of fish in shallow
pools; even the same net with which the peasant fished during the day
was used around his head at night as a double protection against
mosquitoes . 61 Neverthe- less it was not he who profited by the bounty
of the river. Every acre of the soil belonged to the Pharaoh, and other
men could use it only by. his kind indulgence; every tiller of the earth
had to pay him an annual tax of ten 62 or twenty“ per cent in kind.
Large tracts were owned by the feudal</p>

<p>It is a characteristic bit of literary exaggeration; but the author
might have added that the peasant was subject at any time to the corvee
, doing forced labor for the King, dredging the canals, building roads,
tilling the royal lands, or dragging great stones and obelisks for
pyramids, temples and palaces. Probably a majority of the laborers in
the field were mod- erately content, accepting their poverty patiently.
Many of them were slaves, captured in the wars or bonded for debt;
sometimes slave-raids were organized, and women and children from abroad
were sold to the highest bidder at home. An old relief in the Leyden
Museum pictures a long procession of Asiatic captives passing gloomily
into the land of bondage: one sees them still alive on that vivid stone,
their hands tied behind their backs or their heads, or thrust through
rude handcuffs of wood; their faces empty with the apathy that has known
the last despair.</p>

tempta- tion to private initiative, and for many centuries mining was a
government monopoly® Copper was mined in small quantities,® iron was
imported from the Hittites, gold mines were found along the eastern
coast, in Nubia, and in every vassal treasury. Diodorus Siculus (56
b.c.) describes Egyptian miners following with lamp and pick the veins
of gold in the earth, chil- dren carrying up the heavy ore, stone
mortars pounding it to bits, old men and women washing the dirt away. We
cannot tell to what extent</p>
<p>nationalistic exaggeration distorts the famous passage:</p>
<p>The kings of Egypt collect condemned prisoners, prisoners of</p>
<p>war and others who, beset by false accusations, have been in a
fit</p>
<p>of anger thrown into prison. These — sometimes alone, sometimes</p>
<p>with their entire family — they send to the gold mines, partly to</p>
<p>exact a just vengeance for crimes committed by the condemned,</p>
<p>partly to secure for themselves a big revenue through their toil.</p>
<p>… As these workers can take no care’ of their bodies, and have</p>
<p>not even a garment to hide their nakedness, there is no one who,</p>
<p>seeing these luckless people, would not pity them because of the</p>
<p>excess of their misery, for there is no forgiveness or relaxation
at</p>
<p>all for the sick, or the maimed, or the o ld, or for woman’s
weakness; but all with blows are compelled to stick to their labor
until, worn</p>
<p>out, they die in their servitude. Thus the poor wretches even ac-</p>
<p>count the future more dreadful than the present because of the</p>
<p>excess of their punishment, and look to death as more desirable</p>
<p>than life.®</p>
<p>In its earliest dynasties Egypt learned the art of fusing copper
with</p>
<p>tin to make bronze: first, bronze weapons — swords, helmets and
shields; then bronze tools — wheels, rollers, levers, pulleys,
windlasses, wedges, lathes, screws, drills that bored the toughest
diorite stone, saws that cut the massive slabs of the sarcophagi.
Egyptian workers made brick, cement and plaster of Paris; they glazed
pottery, blew glass, and glorified both with color. They were masters in
the carving of wood; they made every- thing from boats and carriages,
chairs and beds, to handsome coffins that almost invited men to die. Out
of animal skins they made clothing,</p>
<p>quivers, shields and seats; all the arts of the tanner are pictured
on the walls of the tombs; and the curved knives represented there in
the tanner’s hand are used by cobblers to this day.” From the papyrus

<p>artisans made ropes, mats, sandals and paper. Other workmen developed
the arts of enameling and varnishing, and applied chemistry to industry.
Still others wove tissues of the subtlest weave in the history of the
textile art; specimens of linen woven four thousand years ago show
today, despite time’s corrosion, “a weave so fine that it requires a
magnifying glass to dis - tinguish it from silk; the best work of the
modern machine-loom is coarse in comparison with this fabric of the
ancient Egyptian hand- loom.” 62 “If,” says Peschel, “we compare the tec
hnical inventory of the Egyptians with our own, it is evident that
before the invention of the steam-engine we scarcely excelled them in
anything.” 62</p>
<p>The workers were mostly freemen, partly slaves. In general every</p>
<p>trade was a caste, as in modern India, and sons were expected to
follow and take over the occupations of their fathers. 61 * The great
wars brought in thousands of captives, making possible the large estates
and the triumphs of engineering. Rameses III presented 1 13,000 slaves
to the temples during the course of his reign. 66 The free artisans were
usually organized for the specific undertaking by a “chief workman” or
overseer, who sold their labor as a group and paid them individually. A
chalk tablet in the British Museum contains a chief workman’s record of
forty -three workers, listing their absences and their causes — “ill,”
or “sacrificing to the god,” or just plain “lazy.” Strikes were
frequent. Once, their pay being long overdue, the workmen besieged the
overseer and threatene d him. “We have been driven here by hunger and
thirst,” they told him; “we have no clothes, we have no oil, we have no
food. Write to our lord the Pharaoh on the sub- ject, and write to the
governor” (of the nome) “who is over us, that they may give us something
for our sustenance.” 67 A Greek tradition reports a great revolt in
Egypt, in which the slaves captured a province, and held it so long that
time, which sanctions everything, gave them legal ownership of it; but
of this revolt there is no record in Egyptian inscriptions. 68 It is
surprising that a civilization so ruthless in its exploitation of labor
should have known — or recorded — so few revolutions.</p>
<p>Egyptian engineering was superior to anything known to the Greeks or
Romans, or to Europe before the Industrial Revolution; only our time has
excelled it, and we may be mistaken. Senusret III, for example, builtt a
wall twenty-seven miles long to gather into Lake Moeris the waters

cul- tivation, and providing a vast reservoir for irrigation.“ Great
canals were constructed, some from the Nile to the Red Sea; the caisson
was used for digging,” and obelisks weighing a thousand tons were
transported over great distances. If we may credit Herodotus, or judge
from later under- takings of the same kind represented in the reliefs of
the Eighteenth Dynasty, these immense stones were drawn on greased beams
by thousands of slaves, and raised to the desired level on inclined
approaches beginning far away. 71 Machinery was rare because muscle was
cheap. See, in one relief, eight hundred rowers in twenty-seven boats
drawing a barge laden with two obelisks” this is the Eden to which our
romantic machine -</p>
<p>wreckers would return. Ships a hundred feet long by half a hundred
feet wide plied the Nile and the Red Sea, and finally sailed the
Mediter- ranean. On land goods were transported by human muscle, later
by donkeys, later by the horse, which probably the Hyksos brought to
Egypt; the camel di d not appear till Ptolemaic days.™ The poor man
walked, or paddled his simple boat; the rich man rode in sedan-chairs
carried by slaves, or later in chariots clumsily made with the weight
placed entirely in front of the axle.™</p>
<p>There was a regular post al service; an ancient papyrus says, “Write
to me by the letter- carrier.”™ Communication, however, was difficult;
roads were few and bad, except for the military highway through Gaza
to</p>
<p>the Euphrates™ and the serpentine form of the Nile, which was the m
ain highroad of Egypt, doubled the distance from town to town. Trade was
comparatively primitive; most of it was by barter in village bazaars.
For- eign commerce grew slowly, restricted severely by the most
up-to-date tariff walls; the various kingdoms of the Near East believed
strongly in the “protective principle,” for customs dues were a mainstay
of their royal treasuries. Nevertheless Egypt grew rich by importing raw
materials and exporting finished products; Syrian, Cretan and Cypriote
merchants</p>
<p>crowded the markets of Egypt, and Phoenician galleys sailed up the
Nile to the busy wharves of Thebes.™</p>

<p>began to pay for goods with rings or ingots of gold, measured by
weight at every transaction; but no coins of definite value guaranteed
by the state arose to facilitate exchange. Credit, however, was highly
developed; written transfers frequently took the place of barter or
payment; scribes were busy everywhere accelerating business with legal
documents of ex- change, accounting and finance.</p>
<p>Every visitor to the Louvre has seen the statue of the Egyptian
scribe, squatting on his haunches, almost completely nude, dressed with
a pen behind the ear as reserve for the one he holds in his hand. He
keeps record of work done and goods paid, of prices and costs, of
profits and loss; he counts the cattle as they move to the slaughter, or
corn as it is measured out in sale; he draws up contracts and wills, and
makes out his master’s income-tax; verily there is nothing new under the
sun. He is sedulously attentive and mechanically industrious; he has
just enough intelligence not to be dangerous. His life is monotonous,
but he consoles himself by writing essays on the hardships of the manual
worker’s existence, and the princely dignity of those whose food is
paper and whose blood is ink.</p>

<p>The bureaucrats — Law — The vizier — The pharaoh</p>
<p>With these scribes as a clerical bureaucracy the Pharaoh and the pro-
vincial nobles maintained law and order in the state. Ancient slabs show
such clerks taking the census, and examining income-tax returns. Through
Nilometers that measured the rise of the river, the scribe-officials
forecast the size of the harvest, and estimated the government’s future
revenue; they allotted appropriations in advance to governmental
departments, supervised industry and trade, and in some measure
achieved, almost at the outset of history, a planned economy regulated
by the state.™</p>
<p>Civil and criminal legislation were highly developed, and already in
the Fifth Dynasty the law of private property and bequest was intricate
and precise.™ As in our own days, there was absolute equality before the
law — whenever the contesting parties had equal resources and influence.
The oldest legal document in the world is a brief, in the British
Museum, presenting to the court a complex case in inheritance. Judges
required cases to be pled and answered, reargued and rebutted, not in
oratory but in writing — which compares favorably with our windy
litigation. Perjury</p>

<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>was punished with death . 80 There were regular courts, rising from
local judgment-seats in the nomes to supreme courts at Memphis, Thebes,
or Heliopolis . 81 Torture was used occasionally as a midwife to truth ;
82 beating with a rod was a frequent punishment, mutilation by cutting
off nose or ears, hand or tongue, was sometimes resorted to , 83 or
exile to the mines, or death by strangling, empaling, beheading, or
burning at the stake; the extreme penalty was to be embalmed alive, to
be eaten slowly by an in- escapable coating of corrosive natron . 84
Criminals of high rank were saved the shame of public execution by being
permitted to kill themselves, as in samurai Japan . 86 We find no signs
of any system of police; even the stand- ing army — always small because
of Egypt’s protected isolation between deserts and seas — was seldom
used for internal discipline. Security of life and property, and the
continuity of law and government, rested almost entirely on the prestige
of the Pharaoh, maintained by the schools and the church. No other
nation except China has ever dared to depend so</p>
<p>largely upon psychological discipline.</p>
<p>It was a well-organized government, with a better record of duration
than any other in history. At the head of the administration was the
Vizier, who served at once as prime minister, chief justice, and head of
the treasury; he was the court of last resort under the Pharaoh himself.
A tomb relief shows us the Vizier leaving his house early in the morning
to hear the petitions of the poor, “to hear,” as the inscription reads,
“wha t the people say in their demands, and to make no distinction
between small and great .” 80 A remarkable papyrus roll, which comes
down to us from the days of the Empire, purports to be the form of
address (perhaps it is but a literary invention) with which the Pharaoh
installed a new Vizier:</p>
<p>Look to the office of the Vizier; be watchful over all that is
done</p>
<p>therein. Behold, it is the established support of the whole land. . .
.</p>
<p>The Vizierate is not sweet; it is bitter. . . . Behold, it is not
to</p>
<p>show respect-of-persons to princes and councillors; it is not to make
for himself slaves of any people. . . . Behold, when a petitioner</p>
<p>comes from Upper or Lower Egypt … see thou to it that every-</p>
<p>thing is done in accordance with law, that everything is done ac-</p>
<p>cording to the custom thereof, (giving) to (every man) his right.</p>
<p>… It is an abomination of the god to show partiality. . . . Look</p>
<p>upon him who is known to thee like him who is unknown to thee;</p>
<p>and him who is near the King like him who is far from (his
House).</p>

<p>Behold, a prince who does this, he shall endure here in this
place.</p>
<p>. . . The dread of a prince is that he does justice. . . .
(Behold</p>
<p>the regulation) that is laid upon thee. 87</p>
<p>The Pharaoh himself was the supreme court; any case might under</p>
<p>certain circumstances be brought to him, if the plaintiff was
careless of expense. Ancient carvings show us the “Great House” from
which he ruled, and in which the offices of the government were
gathered; from this Great House, which the Egyptians called Pero and
which the Jews trans- lated Pharaoh, came the title of the emperor. Here
he carried on an arduous routine of executive work, sometimes with a
schedule as rigorous as Chandragupta’s, Louis XIV’s or Napoleon’s. 88
When he traveled the nobles met him at the feudal frontiers, escorted
and entertained him, and gave him presents proportionate to their
expectations; one lord, says a proud inscription, gave to Amenhotep II
“carriages of silver and gold, statues of ivory and ebony . . . jewels,
weapons, and works of art,” 680 shields, 140 bronze daggers, and many
vases of precious metal. 80 The Pharaoh reciprocated by taking one of
the baron’s sons to live with him at court — a subtle way of exacting a
hostage of fidelity. The oldest of the courtiers constituted a Council
of Elders called Saru, or The Great Ones, who served as an advisory
cabinet to the king. 00 Such counsel was in a sense superfluous, for the
Pharaoh, with the help of the priests, assumed divine descent, powers
and wisdom; this alliance with the gods was the secret of his prestige.
Consequently he was greeted with forms of address always flattering,
sometimes astonishing, as when, in The Story of Sinuhe, a good citizen
hails him: “O long - living King, may the Golden One”</p>
<p>(Hathor the goddess) “give life to thy nose.” 01</p>
<p>As became so godlike a person, the Pharaoh was waited upon by a vari-
ety of aides, including generals, launderers, bleachers, guardians of
the imperial wardrobe, and other men of high degree. Twenty officials
col- laborated to take care of his toilet: barbers who were permitted
only to shave him and cut his hair, hairdressers who adjusted the royal
cowl and diadem to his head, manicurists who cut and polished his nails,
perfumers who deodorized his body, blackened his eyelids with kohl, and
reddened his cheeks and lips with rouge. 02 One tomb inscription
describes its occu- pant as “Overseer of the Cosmetic Box, Overseer of
the Cosmetic Pencil, Sandal- Bearer to the King, doing in the matter of
the King’s sandals to the satisfaction of his Law.” 88 So pampered, he
tended to degenerate, and some -</p>

<li>Morals</li>
</ol>
<p>Royal incest — The harem — Marriage — The position of woman —</p>
<p>The matriar chate in Egypt — Sexual morality</p>
<p>The government of the Pharaohs resembled that of Napoleon, even to
the incest. Very often the king married his own sister — occasionally
his own daughter — to preserve the purity of the royal blood. It is
difficult to say whether this weakened the stock. Certainly Egypt did
not think so, after several thousand years of experiment; the
institution of sister-mar- riage spread among the people, and as late as
the second century after Christ two-thirds of the citizens of Arsinoe
were found to be practising the custom.” T he words brother and sister,
in Egyptian poetry, have the same significance as lover and beloved
among ourselves. 80 In addition to his sisters the Pharaoh had an
abundant harem, recruited not only from captive women but from the
daughters of the nobles and the gifts of foreign po- tentates; so
Amenhotep III received from a prince of Naharina his eldest daughter and
three hundred select maidens. 86 Some of the nobility imi- tated this
tiresome extravagance on a small scale, adjusting their morals to their
resources.</p>
<p>For the most part the common people, like persons of moderate</p>
<p>income everywhere, contented themselves with monogamy. Family life
was apparently as well ordered, as wholesome in moral tone and
influence, as in the highest civilizations of our time. Divorce was rare
until the decadent dynasties. The husband could dismiss his wife without
compensation if he detected her in adultery; if he divorced her for
other reasons he was re- quired to turn over to her a substantial share
of the family property. The fidelity of the husband — so far as we can
fathom such arcana — was as painstaking as in any later culture, and the
position of woman was more advanced than in most countries today. “No
people, ancient or modern,” said Max Muller, “has given women so high a
legal status as did the in- habitants of the Nile Valley.”“ The
monuments picture them eating and d rink ing in public, going about
their affairs in the streets unattended and unharmed, and freely
engaging in industry and trade. Greek travel-</p>

<p>165</p>
<p>ers, accustomed to confine their Xanthippes narrowly, were amazed at
this liberty; they jibed at the henpecked husbands of Egypt, and
Diodorus Siculus, perhaps with a twinkle in his eye, reported that along
the Nile obedience of the husband to the wife was required in the
marriage bond M — a stipulation not necessary in America. Women held and
bequeathed property in their own names; one of the most ancient
documents in his- tory is the Third Dynasty will in which the lady
Neb-sent transmits her lands to her children.“ Hatshepsut and Cleopatra
rose to be queens, and ruled and ruined like kings.</p>
<p>Sometimes a cynical note is heard in the literature. One ancient
moralist warns his readers:</p>
<p>Beware of a woman from abroad, who is not known in her city.</p>
<p>Look not upon her when she comes, and know her not. She is like</p>
<p>the vortex of deep waters, whose whirling is unfathomable. The</p>
<p>woman whose husband is far away, she writes to thee every day. If</p>
<p>there is no witness with her she arises and spreads her net. Oh,</p>
<p>deadly crime if one hearkens ! 100</p>
<p>But the more characteristically Egyptian tone sounds in Ptah- hotep’s
instructions to his son:</p>
<p>If thou art successful, and hast furnished thy house, and lovest
the</p>
<p>wife of thy bosom, then fill her stomach and clothe her back. . .
.</p>
<p>Make glad her heart during the time thou hast her, for she is a
field</p>
<p>profitable to its owner. … If thou oppose her it will mean thy</p>
<p>ruin . 101</p>
<p>And the Boulak Papyrus admonishes the child with touching wisdom:
Thou shalt never forget thy mother. … For she carried thee long</p>
<p>beneath her breast as a heavy burden; and after thy months were ac-
complished she bore thee. Three long years she carried thee upon</p>
<p>her shoulder, and gave thee her breast to thy mouth. She nurtured</p>
<p>thee, and took no offense from thy uncleanliness. And when thou</p>
<p>didst enter school, and wast instructed in the writings, daily
she</p>
<p>stood by the master with bread and beer from the house . 103</p>
<p>It is likely that this high status of woman arose from the mildly
matri- archal character of Egyptian society. Not only was woman full
mistress</p>
<p>1 66 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>in the house, but all estates descended in the female line; “even in
late</p>
<p>Even in courtship the woman usually took the initiative. The love</p>
<p>poems and letters that have come down to us are generally addressed
by the lady to the man; she begs for assignations, she presses her suit
directly, she formally proposes marriage . 108 “Oh my beautiful friend,”
says one letter, “my desire is to become, as thy wife, the mistress of
all thy posses - sions .” 109 Hence modest y, as distinct from fidelity,
was not prominent among the Egyptians; they spoke of sexual affairs with
a directness alien to our late morality, adorned their very temples with
pictures and bas- reliefs of startling anatomical candor, and supplied
their dead with obscene literature to amuse them in the grave . 110
Blood ran warm along the Nile: girls were nubile at ten, and premarital
morals were free and easy; one courtesan, in Ptolemaic days, was reputed
to have built a pyramid with her savings; even sodomy had its clientele
. 111 Dancing-girls, in the manner of Japan, were accepted into the best
male society as providers of enter- tainment and physical edification;
they dressed in diaphanous robes, or contented themselves with anklets,
bracelets and rings . 112 Evidences occur of religious prostitution on a
small scale; as late as the Roman occupa-</p>

<p>Character — Games — Appearance — Cosmetics — Costume — Jewelry</p>
<p>If we try to visualize the Egyptian character we find it difficult to
dis- tinguish between the ethics of the literature and the actual
practices of life. Very frequently noble sentiments occur; a poet, for
example, counsels his countrymen:</p>
<p>Give bread to him who has no field,</p>
<p>And create for thyself a good name for ever more; 114</p>
<p>and some of the elders give very laudable advice to their children. A
papyrus in the British Museum, known to scholars as “The Wisdom of
Amenemope ,, (ca. 950 b.c.), prepares a student for public office with
admonitions that prob- ably influenced the author or authors of the
“Proverbs of Solomon.”</p>
<p>Be not greedy for a cubit of land,</p>
<p>And trespass not on the boundary of the widow. . . .</p>
<p>Plough the fields that thou mayest find thy needs,</p>
<p>And receive thy bread from thine own threshing floor.</p>
<p>Better is a bushel which God giveth to thee</p>
<p>Than five thousand gained by transgression. . . .</p>
<p>Better is poverty in the hand of God</p>
<p>Than riches in the storehouse;</p>
<p>And better are loaves when the heart is joyous</p>
<p>Than riches in unhappiness. . .</p>
<p>Such pious literature did not prevent the normal operation of human
greed. Plato described the Athenians as loving knowledge, the Egyptians
as loving wealth; perhaps he was too patriotic. In general the Egyptians
were the Americans of antiquity: enamored of size, given to gigantic
engineering and majestic building, industrious and accumulative,
practical even in the midst of many ultramundane superstitions. They
were the arch-conservatives of his- tory; the more they changed, the
more they remained the same; through forty centuries their artists
copied the old conventions religiously. They ap- pear to us, from their
monuments, to have been a matter-of-fact people, not given to
non-theological nonsense. They had no sentimental regard for</p>
<p>l68 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>human life, and killed with the clear conscience of nature; Egyptian
soldiers cut off the right hand, or the phallus, of a slain enemy, and
brought it to the proper scribe that it might be put into the record to
their credit. 1 “ In the later dynasties the people, long accustomed to
internal peace and to none but distant wars, lost all military habits
and qualities, until at last a few Roman soldiers sufficed to master all
Egypt . 117</p>
<p>The accident that we know them chiefly from the remains in their
tombs or the inscriptions on their temples has misled us into
exaggerating their solemnity. We perceive from some of their sculptures
and reliefs, and from their burlesque stories of the gods, 1 “ that they
had a jolly turn for humor. They played many public and private games,
such as checkers and dice; 1 “ they gave many modem toys to their
children, like marbles, bouncing balls, ten- pins and tops; they enjoyed
wrestling contests, boxing matches and bull- fights .“ 0 At feasts and
recreations they were anointed by attendants, were wreathed with
flowers, feted with wines, and presented with gifts.</p>
<p>From the painting and the statuary we picture them as a
physically</p>
<p>vigorous people, muscular, broad-shouldered, thin-waisted,
full-lipped, and flat-footed from going unshod. The upper classes are
represented as fashionably slender, imperiously tall, with oval face,
sloping forehead, regular features, a long, straight nose, and
magnificent eyes. Their skin was white at birth (indicating an Asiatic
rather than an African origin), but rapidly darkened under the Egyptian
sun ; 121 their artists idealized them in painting the men red, the
women yellow; perhaps these colors were merely cosmetic styles. The man
of the people, however, is pictured as short and squat, like the “Sheik
-el- Beled,” formed by heavy toil and an unbalanced ration; his features
are rough, his nose blunt and wide; he is intelligent but coarse.
Perhaps, as in so many other instances, the people and their rulers were
of different races: the rulers of Asiatic, the people of African,
deriva- tion. The hair was dark, sometimes curly, but never woolly.
Women bobbed their hair in the most modern mode; men shaved lips and
chin, but consoled themselves with magnificent wigs. Often, in order to
wear these more comfortably, they shaved the head; even the queen
consort (e.g., Ikhnaton’s mother Tiy) cut off all her hair to wear more
easily the royal wig and crown. It was a matter of rigid etiquette that
the king</p>
<p>should have the biggest wig .“ 2</p>
<p>According to their means they repaired the handiwork of nature</p>
<p>with subtle cosmetic art. Faces were rouged, lips were painted, nails
were colored, hair and limbs were oiled; even in the sculptures the
Egyptian</p>

<p>women have painted eyes. Those who could afford it had seven creams
and two kinds of rouge put into their tombs when they died. The re-
mains abound in toilet sets, mirrors, razors, hair-curlers, hair-pins,
combs, cosmetic boxes, dishes and spoons — made of wood, ivory,
alabaster or bronze, and designed in delightful and appropriate forms.
Eye-paint still survives in some of the tubes. The kohl that women use
today for paint- ing the eyebrows and the face is a lineal descendant of
the oil used by the Egyptians; it has come down to us through the Arabs,
whose word for it, al-kohl, has given us our word alcohol. Perfumes of
all sorts were used on the body and the clothes, and homes were made
fragrant with incense and myrrh . 128</p>
<p>Their clothing ran through every gradation from primitive nudity
to</p>
<p>the gorgeous dress of Empire days. Children of both sexes went about,
till their teens, naked except for ear-rings and necklaces; the girls,
however, showed a beseeming modesty by wearing a string of beads around
the middle . 124 Servants and peasants limited their everyday wardrobe
to a loin-cloth. Under the Old Kingdom free men and women went naked to
the navel, and covered themselves from waist to knees with a short,
tight skirt of white linen . 128 Since shame is a child of custom rather
than of nature, these simple garments contented the conscience as
completely as Victorian petticoats and corsets, or the evening dress of
the contemporary American male; “our virtues lie in the interpretation
of the time.” Even the priests, in the first dynasties, wore nothing but
loin-cloths, as we see from the statue of Ranofer . 120 When wealth
increased, clothing increased; the Middle Kingdom added a second and
larger skirt over the first, and the Empire added a covering for the
breast, with now and then a cape. Coachmen and grooms took on formidable
costumes, and ran through the streets in full livery to clear a way for
the chariots of their masters. Women, in the prosperous dynasties,
abandoned the tight skirt for a loose robe that passed over the shoulder
and was joined in a clasp under the right breast. Flounces, embroideries
and a thousand frills appeared, and fashion entered like a serpent to
disturb the paradise of primitive nudity . 121</p>
<p>Both sexes loved ornament, and covered neck, breast, arms, wrists and
ankles with jewelry. As the nation fattened on the tribute of Asia and
the commerce of the Mediterranean world, jewelry ceased to be restricted
to the aristocracy, and became a passion with all classes. Every scribe

<p>merchant had his seal of silver or gold; every man had a ring, every
woman had an ornamental chain. These chains, as we see them in the
museums today, are of infinite variety: some of them two to three
inches, some of them five feet, in length; some thick and heavy, some
“as slight and flexible as the finest Venetian lace.”™ About the time of
the Eighteenth Dynasty ear-rings became de rigueur; every one had to
have the ears pierced for them, not only girls and women, but boys and
men. 128 Men as well as women decorated their persons with bracelets and
rings, pendants and beads of costly stone. The women of ancient Egypt
could learn very little from us in the matter of cosmetics and jewelry
if they were rein- carnated among us today.</p>

<p>The priests imparted rudimentary instruction to the children of
the</p>
<p>well-to-do in schools attached to the temples, as in the Roman
Catholic parishes of our age. 130 One high-priest, who was what we
should term Min- ister or Secretary of Education, calls himself “Chief
of the Royal Stable - duce scribes for the clerical work of the state.
To stimulate his pupils he wrote eloquent essays on the advantages of
education. “Give thy heart to learning, and love her like a mother,”
says one edifying papyrus, “for there is nothing so precious as
learning.” “Behold,” says another, “there is no profession that is not
governed; it is only the learned man who rules himself.” It is a
misfortune to be a soldier, writes an early bookworm; it is a weariness
to till the earth; the only happiness is “to turn the heart to books
during the daytime and to read during the night.” 188</p>
<p>Copy-books survive from the days of the Empire with the corrections
of the masters still adorning the margins; the abundance of errors would
console the modem schoolboy. 188 The chief method of instruction was the
dictation or copying of texts, which were written upon potsherds or
lime- stone flakes. 18 * The subjects were largely commercial, for the
Egyptians were the first and greatest utilitarians; but the chief topic
of pedagogic</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>discourse was virtue, and the chief problem, as ever, was discipline.
“Do not spend thy time in wishing, or thou wilt come to a bad end,” we
read in one of the copy- books. “Let thy mouth read the book in thy
hand; take advice from those who know more than thou dost”— this last is
prob- ably one of the oldest phrases in any language. Discipline was
vigorous, and based upon the simplest principles. “The youth has a
back,” says a euphemistic manuscript, “and attends when he is beaten, .
. . for the ears of the young are placed on the back.” A pupil writes to
his former</p>
<p>teacher: “Thou didst beat my back, and thy instructions went into my
ear.” That this animal -training did not always succeed appears from a
papyrus in which a teacher laments that his former pupils love books
much less than beer . 135</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a large number of the temple students were graduated
from the hands of the priest to high schools attached to the offices of
the state treasury. There, in the first known School of Government, the
young scribes were instructed in public administration. On graduating
they were apprenticed to officials, who taught them through plenty of
work. Per- haps it was a better way of securing and training public
servants than our modern selection of them by popularity and
subserviency, and the noise of the hustings. In this manner Egypt and
Babylonia developed, more or less simultaneously, the earliest
school-systems in history ; 130 not till the nineteenth century of our
era was the public instruction of the young to be so well organized
again.</p>
<p>In the higher grades the student was allowed to use paper — one of
the main items of Egyptian trade, and one of the permanent gifts of
Egypt to the world. The stem of the papyrus plant was cut into strips,
other strips were placed crosswise upon these, the sheet was pressed,
and paper, the very stuff (and nonsense) of civilization, was made . 131
How well they made it may be judged from the fact that manuscripts
written by them five thousand years ago are still intact and legible.
Sheets were com- bined into books by gumming the right edge of one sheet
to the left edge of the next; in this way rolls were produced which were
sometimes forty yards in length; they were seldom longer, for there were
no verbose his- torians in Egypt. Ink, black and indestructible, was
made by mixing</p>
<p>water with soot and vegetable gums on a wooden palette; the pen was a
simple reed, fashioned at the tip into a tiny brush . 133</p>
<p>With these modern instruments the Egyptians wrote the most
ancient</p>
<p>17 2 the story of civilization (chap. VIII</p>
<p>of literatures. Their language had probably come in from Asia;
the</p>
<p>oldest specimens of it show many Semitic affinities. 1 ” The earliest
writing was apparently pictographic — an object was represented by
drawing a pic- ture of it: e.g., the word for house (Egyptian per) was
indicated by a small rectangle with an opening on one of the long sides.
As some ideas were too abstract to be literally pictured, pictography
passed into ideog- raphy: certain pictures were by custom and convention
used to represent not the objects pictured but the ideas suggested by
them; so the forepart of a lion meant supremacy (as in the Sphinx), a
wasp meant royalty, and a tadpole stood for thousands. As a further
development along this line, abstract ideas, which had at first resisted
representation, were indicated by picturing objects whose names happened
to resemble the spoken words that corresponded to the ideas; so the
picture of a lute came to mean not only lute, but good, because the
Egyptian word-sound for lute — nefer — resembled the word-sound for good
— nofer. Queer rebus combinations grew out of these homonyms — words of
like sound but different meanings. Since the verb to be was expressed in
the spoken language by the sound khopiru, the scribe, being puzzled to
find a picture for so intangible a con- ception, split the word into
parts, kho-pi-ru, expressed these by picturing in succession a sieve
(called in the spoken language khau), a mat (pi), and a mouth (ru) use
and wont, which sanctify so many absurdities, soon made this strange
assortment of characters, suggest the idea of being. In this way the
Egyptian arrived at the syllable, the syllabic sign, and the syllabary —
i.e., a collection of syllabic signs; and by dividing difficult words
into syllables, finding homonyms for these, and drawing in combina- tion
the objects suggested by these syllabic sounds, he was able, in the
course of time, to make the hieroglyphic signs convey almost any
idea.</p>
<p>Only one step remained — to invent letters. The sign for a house
meant at first the word for house — per; then it meant the sound per, or
p-r with any vowel in between, as a syllable in any word. Then the
picture was shortened, and used to represent the sound po, pa, pu, pe or
pi in any word; and since vowels were never written, this was equivalent
to having a character for P. By a like development the sign for a hand
(Egyptian dot) came to mean do, da, etc., finally D; the sign for mouth
(ro or ru) came to mean R; the sign for snake (zt) became Z; the sign
for lake (shy) became Sh. . . . The result was an alphabet of
twenty-four consonants, which passed with Egyptian and Phoenician trade
to all quarters of the Mediterranean, and came down, via Greece and
Rome, as one of the most</p>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>*73</p>
<p>precious parts of our Oriental heritage. 1 “ Hieroglyphics are as old
as the earliest dynasties; alphabetic characters appear first in
inscriptions left by the Egyptians in the mines of the Sinai peninsula,
variously dated at 2500 and 1500 B.c. m#</p>
<p>Whether wisely or not, the Egyptians never adopted a completely</p>
<p>alphabetic writing; like modem stenographers they mingled
pictographs, ideographs and syllabic signs with their letters to the
very end of their civilization. This has made it difficult for scholars
to read Egyptian, but it is quite conceivable that such a medley of
longhand and shorthand facilitated the business of writing for those
Egyptians who could spare the time to learn it. Since English speech is
no honorable guide to English spelling, it is probably as difficult for
a contemporary lad to leam the devious ways of English orthography as it
was for the Egyptian scribe to memorize by use the five hundred
hieroglyphs, their secondary syllabic meanings, and their tertiary
alphabetic uses. In the course of time a more rapid and sketchy form of
writing was developed for manuscripts, as dis- tinguished from the
careful “sacred carvings” of the monuments. Since this corruption of
hieroglyphic was first made by the priests and the temple scribes, it
was called by the Greeks hieratic ; but it soon passed into common use
for public, commercial and private documents. A still more abbreviated
and careless form of this script was developed by the common people, and
therefore came to be known as demotic. On the monuments, however, the
Egyptian insisted on having his lordly and lovely hiero- glyphic —
perhaps the most picturesque form of writing ever made.</p>

<p>of the House of Books ”; 142 we cannot tell whether this primeval
library was a repository of literature, or only a dusty storehouse of
public records and documents. The oldest extant Egyptian literature
consists of the “Pyramid Texts”— pious matter engraved on the walls in
five pyramids of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties .* 143 Libraries have
come down to us from as far back as 2000 b.c. — papyri rolled and packed
in jars, labeled, and ranged. on shelves ; 1 * 5 in one such jar was
found the oldest form of the story of Sinbad the Sailor, or, as we might
rather call it, Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>“The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor” is a simple
autobiographical</p>
<p>fragm ent, full of life and feeling. “How glad is he,” says this
ancient</p>
<p>mariner, in a line reminiscent of Dante, “that relateth what he hath
ex - perienced when the calamity hath passed!”</p>
<p>I will relate to thee something that was experienced by me
myself,</p>
<p>when I had set out for the mines of the Sovereign and had gone</p>
<p>down to the sea in a ship of 180 feet in length and 60 feet in
breadth; and therein were 120 sailors of the pick of Egypt. They scanned
the</p>
<p>sky, they scanned the earth, and their hearts were more . . .
than</p>
<p>those of lions. They foretold a storm or ever it came, and a tempest
when as yet it was not.</p>
<p>A storm burst while we were yet at sea. . . . We flew before the</p>
<p>wind and it made … a wave eight cubits high. . . .</p>
<p>Then the ship perished, and of them that were in it not one sur-</p>
<p>vived. And I was cast onto an island by a wave of the sea, and I</p>
<p>spent three days alone with mine heart as my companion. I slept</p>
<p>under the shelter of a tree, and embraced the shade. Then I stretched
forth my feet in order to find out what I could put into my mouth.</p>
<p>I found figs and vines there, and all manner of fine leeks. . . .
There</p>
<p>were fish there and fowl, and there was nothing that was not in
it.</p>
<p>. . . When I had made me a fire-drill I kindled a fire and made a</p>
<p>burnt-offering for the gods . 140</p>
<p>Another tale recounts the adventures of Sinuhe, a public official who
flees from Egypt at the death of Amenemhet I, wanders from country to
country of the Near East, and, despite prosperity and honors there,
suffers unbearably from lonesomeness for his native land. At last he
gives up riches, and makes his way through many hardships back to
Egypt.</p>

matter than that my corpse should be buried in the land wherein I</p>
<p>was born? Come to mine aid! May good befall, may God show me</p>

<p>In the sequel we find him home again, weary and dusty with many miles
of desert travel, and fearful lest the Pharaoh reprove him for his long
ab- sence from a land which, like all others, looked upon itself as the
only civilized country in the world. But the Pharaoh forgives him, and
extends to him every cosmetic courtesy:</p>

<p>Short stories are diverse and plentiful in the fragments that have
come down to us of Egyptian literature. There are marvelous tales of
ghosts, miracles, and other fascinating concoctions, as credible as the
detective stories that satisfy modern statesmen; there are high-sounding
romances of princes and princesses, kings and queens, including the
oldest known form of the tale of Cinderella, her exquisite foot, her
wandering slipper, and her royal-hymen- eal denouement ; 148 there are
fables of animals illustrating by their conduct the foibles and passions
of humanity, and pointing morals sagely 149 — a kind of premonitory
plagiarism from TEsop and La Fontaine. Typical of the Egyptian mingling
of natural and supernatural is the tale of Anupu and Bitiu, oider and
younger brothers, who live happily on their farm until Anupu’s wife
falls in love with Bitiu, is repulsed by him, and revenges herself by
accusing him, to his brother, of having offered her violence. Gods and
crocodiles come to Bitiu’s aid against Anupu; but Bitiu, disgusted with
mankind, m utilates himself to prove his innocence, retires Timon-like
to the woods, and places his heart unreachably high on the topmost
flower of a tree. The gods, pitying his lone 7 liness, create for him a
wife of such beauty that the Nile falls in love with her, and steals a
lock of her hair. Drifting down the stream, the lock is found by the
Pharaoh, who, intoxicated by its scent, commands his henchmen to find
the owner. She is found and brought to him, and he marries her. Jealous
of Bitiu he sends men to cut down the tree on which Bitiu has placed</p>

<p>his heart. The tree is cut down, and as the flower touches the earth

<p>The early literature of the Egyptians is largely religious; and the
oldest Egyptian poems are the hymns of the Pyramid Texts. Their form is
also the most ancient poetic form known to us — that “parallelism of
members,” or repetition of the thought in different phrase, which the
Hebrew poets adopted from the Egyptians and Babylonians, and
immortalized in the Psalms. 1 ’ 1 As the Old passes into the Middle
Kingdom, the literature tends to become secular and “profane.” We catch
some glimpse of a lost body of amorous literature in a fragment
preserved to us through the laziness of a Middle Kingdom scribe who did
not complete his task of wiping clear an old papyrus, but left legible
some twenty-five lines that tell of a</p>
<p>simple shepherd’s encounter with a goddess. “This goddess,” says the
story, “met with him as he wended his way to the pool, and she had</p>
<p>stripped off her clothes and disarrayed her hair.” The shepherd
reports the matter cautiously:</p>
<p>“Behold ye, when I went down to the swamp. … I saw a woman</p>
<p>therein, and she looked not like a mortal being. My hair stood on</p>
<p>end when I saw her tresses, because her color was so bright.
Never</p>
<p>will I do what she said; awe of her is in my body.” 1 ®</p>
<p>The love songs abound in number and beauty, but as they celebrate
chiefly the amours of brothers and sisters they will shock or amuse the
modern ear. One collection is called “The Beautiful Joyous Songs of</p>
<p>thy sister whom thy heart loves, who walks in the fields.” An
ostracon or shell dating back to the Nineteenth or Twentieth Dynasty
plays a</p>
<p>modern theme on the ancient chords of desire:</p>
<p>The love of my beloved leaps on the bank of the stream.</p>
<p>A crocodile lies in the shadows;</p>
<p>Yet I go down into the water, and breast the wave.</p>
<p>My courage is high on the stream,</p>
<p>And the water is as land to my feet.</p>
<p>It is her love that makes me strong.</p>
<p>She is a book of spells to me.</p>
<p>When I behold my beloved coming my heart is glad,</p>
<p>My arms are spread apart to embrace her;</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>My heart rejoices forever . . . since my beloved came.</p>
<p>When I embrace her I am as one who is in Incense Land,</p>
<p>As one who carries perfumes.</p>
<p>When I kiss her, her lips are opened,</p>
<p>And I am made merry without beer.</p>
<p>Would that I were her Negress slave who is in attendance on her;</p>
<p>So should I behold the hue of all her limbs. 1 “</p>
<p>The lines have been arbitrarily divided here; we cannot tell from the
external form of the original that it is verse. The Egyptians knew that
music and feeling are the twin essences of poetry; if these were
present, the outward shape did not matter. Often, however, the rhythm
was ac- centuated, as we have seen, by “parallelism of members.”
Sometimes the poet used the device of beginning every sentence or stanza
with the same word; sometimes he played like a punster with like sounds
meaning unlike or incongruous things; and it is clear from the texts
that the trick of</p>
<p>alliteration is as old as the Pyramids. 1 “ These simple forms were
enough; with them the Egyptian poet could express almost every shade of
that “romantic” love which Nietzsche supposed was an invention of
the</p>
<p>Troubadours. The Harris Papyrus shows that such sentiments could be
expressed by a woman as well as by a man:</p>
<p>I am thy first sister.</p>
<p>And thou art to me as the garden</p>
<p>Which I have planted with flowers</p>
<p>And all sweet-smelling herbs.</p>
<p>I directed a canal into it,</p>
<p>That thou mightest dip thy hand into it</p>
<p>When the north wind blows cool.</p>
<p>The beautiful place where we take a walk,</p>
<p>When thy hand rests within mine,</p>
<p>With thoughtful mind and joyous heart</p>
<p>Eecause we walk together.</p>
<p>It is intoxicating to me to hear thy voice.</p>
<p>And my life depends upon hearing thee.</p>
<p>Whenever I see thee</p>
<p>It is better to me than food or drink.”®</p>
<p>All in all it is astonishing how varied the fragments are. Formal
letters, legal documents, historical narratives, magic formulas,
laborious hymns, books</p>
<p>178 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>of devotion, songs of love and war, romantic novelettes, moral
exhortations, philosophical treatises — everything is represented here
except epic and drama, and even of these one might by stretching a point
find instances. The story of Rameses II’s dashing victories, engraved
patiently in verse upon brick after brick of the great pylon at Luxor,
is epic at least in length and dulness. In another inscription Rameses
IV boasts that in a play he had defended Osiris from Set, and had
recalled Osiris to life “ 8 Our knowledge does not allow us to amplify
this hint.</p>
<p>Historiography, in Egypt, is as old as history; even the kings of the
pre- dynastic period kept historical records proudly. 157 Official
historians accom- panied the Pharaohs on their expeditions, never saw
their defeats, and re- corded, or invented, the details of their
victories; already the writing of his- tory had become a cosmetic art.
As far back as 2500 b.c. Egyptian scholars made lists of their kings,
named the years from them, and chronicled the out- standing events of
each year and reign; by the time of Thutmose III these documents became
full-fledged histories, eloquent with patriotic emotion. 158 Egyptian
philosophers of the Middle Kingdom thought both man and history old and
effete, and mourned the lusty youth of their race; Khekheperre- Sonbu, a
savant of the reign of Senusret II, about 2150 b.c., complained that all
things had long since been said, and nothing remained for literature
except repetition. “Would,” he cried unhappily, “that I had words that
are un - known, utterances and sayings in new language, that hath not
yet passed away, and without that which hath been said repeatedly — not
an utterance that hath grown stale, what the ancestors have already
said.” 160</p>
<p>Distance blurs for us the variety and changefulness of Egyptian
lit-</p>
<p>erature, as it blurs the individual differences of unfamiliar
peoples. Never- theless, in the course of its long development Egyptian
letters passed through movements and moods as varied as those that have
disturbed the history of European literature. As in Europe, so in Egypt
the language of everyday speech diverged gradually, at last almost
completely, from that in which the books of the Old Kingdom had been
written. For a long time authors continued to compose in the ancient
tongue; scholars acquired it in school, a nd students were compelled to
translate the “classics” with the help of grammars and vocabularies, and
with the occasional as- sistance of “interlinears.” In the fourteenth
century b.c. Egyptian authors rebelled against this bondage to
tradition, and like Dante and Chaucer dared to write in the language of
the people; Ikhnaton’s famous Hymn to the Sun is itself composed in the
popular speech. The new literature was realistic, youthful, buoyant; it
took delight in flouting the old forms and</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>I ?9</p>
<p>describing the new life. In time this language also became literary
and formal, refined and precise, rigid and impeccable with conventions
of word and phrase; once again the language of letters separated from
the language of speech, and scholasticism flourished; the schools of
Saite Egypt spent half their time studying and translating the
“classics” of Ikhnaton’s day. 1 ” Similar transformations of the native
tongue went on under the Greeks, under the Romans, under the Arabs;
another is going on today. Panta m — all things flow; only scholars
never change.</p>
<p>8 . Science</p>
<p>Origins of Egyptian science — Mathematics — Astronomy and the</p>
<p>calendar — Anatomy and physiology — Medicine , surgery</p>
<p>and hygiene</p>
<p>The scholars of Egypt were mostly priests, enjoying, far from the
tur- moil of life, the comfort and security of the temples; and it was
these priests who, despite all their superstitions, laid the foundations
of Egyptian science. According to their own legends the sciences had
been invented some 18,000 b.c. by Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom,
during his three- thousand-year-long reign on earth; and the most
ancient books in each science were among the twenty thousand volumes
composed by this learned deity.* 181 Our knowledge does not permit us to
improve sub- stantially upon this theory of the origins of science in
Egypt.</p>
<p>At the very outset of recorded Egyptian history we find mathematics
highly developed; the design and construction of the Pyramids involved a
pre- cision of measurement impossible without considerable mathematical
lore. The dependence of Egyptian life upon the fluctuations of the Nile
led to careful records and calculations of the rise and recession of the
river; sur- veyors and scribes were continually remeasuring the land
whose boundaries had been obliterated by the inundation, and this
measuring of the land was evidently the origin of geo-metry. 180 Nearly
all the ancients agreed in ascrib- ing the invention of this science to
the Egyptians. 104 Josephus, however, thought that Abraham had brought
arithmetic from Chaldea (i.e., Mesopo- tamia) to Egypt; 100 and it is
not impossible that this and other arts came to Egypt from “Ur of the
Chaldees,” or some other center of western Asia.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we are assured by Iamblichus (ca. 300 a.d.). Manetho, the
Egyptian historian (ca. 300 b.c.) , would have considered this estimate
unjust to the god; the proper number of Thoth’s works, in his reckoning,
was 36,000. The Greeks celebrated Thoth under the name of Hermes
Trismegistus — Hermes (Mercury) the Thrice-Great. 102</li>

<p>The figures used were cumbersome — one stroke for i, two strokes for
2, . . . nine strokes for 9, with a new sign for 10. Two 10 signs stood
for 20, three 10 signs for 30, . . . nine for 90, with a new sign for
100. Two 100 signs stood for 200, three 100 signs for 300, . . . nine
for 900, with a new sign for 1000. The sign for 1,000,000 was a picture
of a man striking his hands above his head, as if to express amazement
that such a number should exist. 106 The Egyptians fell just short of
the decimal system; they had no zero, and never reached the idea of
expressing all numbers with ten digits: e.g., they used twenty-seven
signs to write 999. 167 They had fractions, but always with the
numerator 1; to express per they wrote 14 + ! 4 - Multiplication and
division tables are as old as the Pyramids. The oldest mathematical
treatise known is the Ahmes Papyrus, dating back to 2000-1700 b.c.; but
this in turn refers to mathematical writings five hundred years more
ancient than itself. It illus- trates by examples the computation of the
capacity of a barn or the area of a field, and passes to algebraic
equations of the first degree. 108 Egyptian geome- try measured not only
the area of squares, circles and cubes, but also the cubic content of
cylinders and spheres; and it arrived at 3.16 as the value of 7T. 109 We
enjoy the honor of having advanced from 3.16 to 3.1416 in four thousand
years.</p>
<p>Of Egyptian physics and chemistry we know nothing, and almost as
little of Egyptian astronomy. The star-gazers of the temples seem to
have con- ceived the earth as a rectangular box, with mountains at the
corners uphold- ing the sky. 170 They made no note of eclipses, and were
in general less ad- vanced than their Mesopotamian contemporaries.
Nevertheless they knew enough to predict the day on which the Nile would
rise, and to orient their temples toward that point on the horizon where
the sun would appear on the morning of the summer solstice. 171 Perhaps
they knew more than they cared to publish among a people whose
superstitions were so precious to their rulers; the priests regarded
their astronomical studies as an esoteric and mys- terious science,
which they were reluctant to disclose to the common world. 172 For
century after century they kept track of the position and movements of
the planets, until their records stretched back for thousands of years.
They distinguished between planets and fixed stars, noted in their
catalogues stars of the fifth magnitude (practically invisible to the
unaided eye), and charted what they thought were the astral influences
of the heavens on the fortunes of men. From these observations they
built the calendar which was to be another of Egypt’s greatest gifts to
mankind.</p>
<p>They began by dividing the year into three seasons of four months
each: first, the rise, overflow and recession of the Nile; second, the
period of cul - tivation; and third, the period of harvesting. To each
of these months they assigned thirty days, as being the most convenient
approximation to the lunar</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>month of twenty-nine and a half days; their word for month, like
ours, was derived from their symbol for the moon.* At the end of the
twelfth month they added five days to bring the year into harmony with
the river and the sun. 174 As the beginning of their year they chose the
day on which the Nile usually reached its height, and on which,
originally, the great star Sirius (which they called Sothis) rose
simultaneously with the sun. Since their calendar allowed only 365,
instead of 365 54 , days to a year, this “heliacal rising” of Sirius
(i.e., its appearance just before sunrise, after having bee n invisible
for a number of days) came a day later every four years; and in this way
the Egyptian calendar diverged by six hours annually from the actual
calendar of the sky. The Egyptians never corrected this error. Many
years later (46 b.c.) the Greek astronomers of Alexandria, by direction
of Julius Caesar, improved this calendar by adding an extra day every
fourth year; this was the “Julian Calendar.” Under Pope Gregory XIII
(1582)</p>
<p>a more accurate correction was made by omitting this extra day
(February 29th) in century years not divisible by 400; this is the
“Gregorian Calendar” that we use today. Our calendar is essentially the
creation of the ancient Near East.f 75</p>
<p>Despite the opportunities offered by embalming, the Egyptians made
rela- tively poor progress in the study of the human body. They thought
that the blood-vessels carried air, water, and excretory fluids, and
they believed the</p>
<ul>
<li>The clepsydra, or water-clock, was so old with the Egyptians that
they attributed its invention to their handy god-of-all-trades, Thoth.
The oldest clock in existence dates from Thutmose III, and is now in the
Berlin Museum. It consists of a bar of wood, divided into six parts or
hours, upon which a crosspiece was so placed that its shadow on the bar
would indicate the time of the morning or the afternoon. 178</li>
</ul>
<p>f Since the heliacal rising of Sirius occurred one day later, every
four years, than the Egyptian calendar demanded, the error amounted to
365 days in 1460 years; on the com- pletion of th is “Sothic cycle” (as
the Egyptians called it) the paper calendar and die celestial calendar
again agreed. Since we know from the Latin author Censorius that the
heliacal rising of Sirius coincided in 139 a.d. with the beginning of
the Egyptian calendar year, we may presume that a similar coincidence
occurred every 1460 years previously — i.e., in 1321 b.c., 2781 b.c.,
4241 b.c., etc. And since the Egyptian calendar was apparently
established in a year when the heliacal rising of Sirius took place on
the first day of the first month, we conclude that that calendar came
into operation in a year that opened a Sothic cycle. The earliest
mention of the Egyptian calendar is in the religious texts in- scribed
in the pyramids of the Fourth Dynasty. Since this dynasty is
unquestionably earlier than 1321 b.c., the calendar must have been
established in 2781 b.c., or 4241 b.c., or still earlier. The older
date, once acclaimed as the first definite date in history, has been
disputed by Professor Scharff, and it is possible that we shall have to
accept 2781 b.c. as the approximate birth-year of the Egyptian calendar.
This would require a foreshorten- ing, by three or four hundred years,
of the dates assigned above for the early dynasties and the great
Pyramids. As the matter is very much in dispute, the chronology of the
Cambridge Ancient History has been adopted in these pages.</p>

the driving power of the organism and the center of the ci rculatory

<p>The glory of Egyptian science was medicine. Like almost
everything</p>
<p>else in the cultural life of Egypt, it began with the priests, and
dripped with evidences of its magical origins. Among the people amulets
were more popular than pills as preventive or curative of disease;
disease was to them a possession by devils, and was to be treated with
incantations. A cold for instance, could be exorcised by such magic
words as: “Depart,</p>
<p>surgery, from cranial fractures to injuries of the spine. Each case
is treated in logical order, under the heads of provisional diagnosis,
examination, semeiology, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and glosses on
the terms used. The author notes, with a clarity unrivaled till the
eighteenth century of our era, that control of the lower limbs i s
localized in the “brain”— a word which here appears for the first time
in literature. 1 ”</p>

gout, mastoiditis, ap- pendicitis, and such marvelous affections as
spondylitis deformans and achondroplasia. There are no signs of syphilis
or cancer; but pyorrhea and dental caries, absent in the oldest mummies,
become frequent in the later ones, indicating the progress of
civilization. The atrophy and fusion of the bones of the small toe,
often ascribed to the modern shoe, was common in ancient Egypt, where
nearly all ages and ranks went barefoot. 18 ”</p>
<p>Against these diseases the Egyptian doctors were armed with an abund-
ant pharmacopoeia. The Ebers Papyrus lists seven hundred remedies for
everything from snake-bite to puerperal fever. The Kahun Papyrus (ca.
1850 b.c.) prescribes suppositories apparently used for contraception.

<p>Architecture — Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, Empire and Sdite</p>
<p>sculpture — Bas-relief — Painting — Minor arts — Music — The
artists</p>
<p>The greatest element in this civilization was its art. Here, almost
at</p>
<p>the threshold of history, we find an art powerful and mature,
superior to that of any modern nation, and equaled only by that of
Greece. At first the luxury of isolation and peace, and then, under
Thutmose III and</p>
<p>Rameses II, the spoils of oppression and war, gave to Egypt the
oppor- tunity and the means for massive architecture, masculine
statuary, and a hundred minor arts that so early touched perfection. The
whole theory of progress hesitates before Egyptian art.</p>
<p>Architecture* was the noblest of the ancient arts, because it
combined in imposing form mass and duration, beauty and use. It began
humbly in the adornment of tombs and the external decoration of homes.
Dwellings were mostly of mud, with here and there some pretty woodwork
(a Japanese lattice, a well-carved portal), and a roof strengthened with
the tough and pliable trunks of the palm. Around the house, normally,
was a wall enclosing a court; from the court steps led to the roof; from
this the tenants passed down into the rooms. The well-to-do had private
gardens, carefully landscaped; the cities provided public gardens for
the poor, and hardly a home but had its ornament of flowers. Inside the
house the walls were hung with colored mattings, and the floors, if the
master could afford it, were covered with rugs. People sat on these rugs
rather than on chairs; the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom squatted for
their</p>
<p>meals at tables six inches high, in the fashion of the Japanese; and
ate with their fingers, like Shakespeare. Under the Empire, when slaves
were cheap, the upper classes sat on high cushioned chairs, and had
their servants hand them course after course . 100</p>
<p>Stone for building was too cosdy for homes; it was a luxury reserved
for priests and kings. Even the nobles, ambitious though they were,

<p>the greatest wealth and the best building materials to the temples;
in con- sequence the palaces that overlooked almost every mile of the
river in the days of. Amenhotep III crumbled into oblivion, while the
abodes of the gods and the tombs of the dead remained. By the Twelfth
Dynasty the pyramid had ceased to be the fashionable form of sepulture.
Khnumhotep (ca. 2180 b.c.) chose at Beni-Hasan the quieter form of a
colonnade built into the mountainside; and this theme, once established,
played a thou- sand variations among the hills on the western slope of
the Nile. From the time of the Pyramids to the Temple of Hathor at
Denderah — i.e., for some three thousand years — there rose out of the
sands of Egypt such a suc- cession of architectural achievements as no
civilization has ever surpassed. At Kamak and Luxor a riot of columns
raised by Thutmose I and III,</p>
<p>Amenhotep III, Seti I, Rameses II and other monarchs from the Twelfth
to the Twenty-second Dynasty; at Medinet-Habu (ca. 1300 b.c.) a vast but
less distinguished edifice, on whose columns an Arab village rested for
centuries; at Abydos the Temple of Seti I, dark and sombre in its
massive ruins; at Elephantine the little Temple of Khnum (ca. 1400
b.c.), “posi - tively Greek in its precision and elega nce”; 101 at Der
-el-Bahri the stately colonnades of Queen Hatshepsut; near it the
Ramesseum, another forest of colossal columns and statues reared by the
architects and slaves of Rameses II; at Philae the lovely Temple of Isis
(ca. 240 b.c.) desolate and abandoned now that the damming of the Nile
at Assuan has submerged the bases of its perfect columns — these are
sample fragments of the many monuments that still adorn the valley of
the Nile, and attest even in their ruins the strength and courage of the
race that reared them. Here, perhaps, is an excess of pillars, a
crowding of columns against the tyranny of the sun, a Far-Eastern
aversion to symmetry, a lack of unity, a barbaric-mod- em adoration of
size. But here, too, are grandeur, sublimity, majesty and power; here
are the arch and the vault, 100 used sparingly because not needed, but
ready to pass on their principles to Greece and Rome and modem Europe;
here are decorative designs never surpassed; 100 here are papyriform
columns, lotiform columns, “proto - Doric” columns, 100 Caryatid
columns, 108 Hathor capitals, palm capitals, clerestories, and
magnificent architraves full of the strength and stability that are the
very soul of archi- tecture’s powerful appeal.* The Egyptians • were the
greatest builders in history.</p>
<ul>
<li>A clerestory is that portion of a building which, being above the
roof of the sur- rounding parts, admits light to the edifice by a series
of openings. An architrave is the lowest part of an entablature — which
is a superstructure supported by a colonnade.</li>
</ul>
<p>l86 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Some would add that they were also the greatest sculptors. Here at
the outset is the Sphinx, conveying by its symbolism the leonine quality
of some masterful Pharaoh — perhaps Khafre-Chephren; it has not only
size, as some have thought, but character. The cannon-shot of the
Mamelukes have broken the nose and shorn the beard, but nevertheless
those gigantic features portray with impressive skill the force and
dignity, the calm and sceptical maturity, of a natural king. Across
those motionless features a subtle smile has hovered for five thousand
years, as if already the un- known artist or monarch had understood all
that men would ever under- stand about men. It is a Mona Lisa in
stone.</p>
<p>There is nothing finer in the history of sculpture than the diorite
statue of Khafre in the Cairo Museum; as ancient to Praxiteles as
Praxiteles to us, it nevertheless comes down across fifty centuries
almost unhurt by time’s roug h usages; cut in the most intractable of
stones, it passes on to us completely the strength and authority, the
wilfulness and courage, the sensitivity and intelligence of the (artist
or the) King. Near it, and even older, Pharaoh Zoser sits pouting in
limestone; farther on, the guide with lighted match reveals the
transparency of an alabaster Menkaure.</p>
<p>Quite as perfect in artistry as these portraits of royalty are the
figures of the Sheik-el-Beled and the Scribe. The Scribe has come down
to us in many forms, all of uncertain antiquity; the most illustrious is
the</p>
<p>squatting Scribe of the Louvre.* The Sheik is no sheik but only an
over- seer of labor, armed with the staff of authority, and stepping
forward as if in supervision or command. His name, apparently, was
Kaapiru; but the Arab workmen who rescued kirn from his tomb at Salckara
were struck with his resemblance to the Sheik-el-Beled (i.e.,
Mayor-of-the-Village) under whom they lived; and this title which their
good humor gave him is now inseparable from his fame. He is carved only
in mortal wood, but time has not seriously reduced his portly figure or
his chubby legs; his waistline has all the amplitude of the comfortable
bourgeois in every civilization; his rotund face beams with the content
of a man who knows his place and glories in it. The bald head and
carelessly loosened robe display the realism of an art already old
enough to rebel against idealiza- tion; but here, too, is a fine
simplicity, a complete humanity, expressed without bitterness, and with
the ease and grace-of a practised and confident hand. “If,” says
Maspero, “some exhibition of the world’s masterpieces</p>

<p>were to be inaugurated, I should choose this work to uphold the honor
of Egyptian art” 1 ”— or would that honor rest more securely on the head
of Khafre?</p>
<p>These are the chefs- d’ceuvres of Old Kingdom statuary. But
lessei</p>
<p>masterpieces abound: the seated portraits of Rahotep and his wife
Nofrit., the powerful figure of Ranofer the priest, the copper statues
of King Phiops and his son, a falcon-head in gold, the humorous figures
of the Beer-Brewer and the Dwarf Knemhotep — all but one in the Cairo
Museum, all without exception instinct with character. It is true that
the earlier pieces are coarse and crude; that by a strange convention,
running through- out Egyptian art, figures are shown with the body and
eyes facing for- ward, but the hands and feet in profile;* that not much
attention given to the body, which was left in most cases stereotyped
and unreal — all female bodies young, all royal bodies strong; and that
individualization, though masterly, was generally reserved for the head.
But with all the stiffness and sameness that priestly conventions and
control forced upon statuary, paintings and reliefs, these works were
fully redeemed by the power and depth of the conception, the vigor and
precision of the execution, the character, line and finish of the
product. Never was sculpture more alive: the Sheik exudes authority, the
woman grinding grain gives every sense and muscle to her work, the
Scribe is on the very verge of writing. And the thousand little puppets
placed in the tombs to carry on essential in- dustries for the dead were
moulded with a like vivacity, so that we can almost believe, with the
pious Egyptian, that the deceased could not be unhappy while these
ministrants were there.</p>
<p>Not for many centuries did Egyptian sculpture equal again the
achieve- ments of the early dynasties. Because most of the statuary was
made for the temples or the tombs, the priests determined to a great
degree what forms the artist should follow; and the natural conservatism
of religion</p>
<p>crept into art, slowly stifling sculpture into a conventional,
stylistic de- generation. Under the powerful monarchs of the Twelfth
Dynasty the secular spirit reasserted itself, and art recaptured
something of its old vigor and more than its old skill. A head of
Amenemhet III in black diorite 1 “ suggests at once the recovery of
character and the recovery of art; here is the quiet hardness of an able
king, carved with the competence of a master. A colossal statue of
Senusret III is crowned with a head and face</p>
<ul>
<li>There are important exceptions to this — e.g., the Sheik-el-Beled
and the Scribe; obvi- ously the convention was not due to incapacity or
ignorance.</li>
</ul>
<p>188 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>equal in conception and execution to any portrait in the history of
sculp- ture; and the ruined torso of Senusret I, in the Cairo Museum,
ranks with the torso of Hercules in the Louvre. Animal figures abound in
the Egyptian sculpture of every age, and are always full of humor and
life: here is a mouse chewing a nut, an ape devotedly strumming a harp,
a porcupine with every spine on the qui vive. Then came the Shepherd
Kings, and for three hundred years Egyptian art almost ceased to be.</p>
<p>In the age of Hatshepsut, the Thutmoses, the Amenhoteps and the</p>
<p>Rameses, art underwent a second resurrection along the Nile. Wealth
poured in from subject Syria, passed into the temples and the courts,
and trickled through them to nourish every art. Colossi of Thutmose III
and Rameses II began to challenge the sky; statuary crowded every comer
of the temples; masterpieces were flung forth with unprecedented
abundance by a race exhilarated with what they thought was world
supremacy. The fine granite bust of the great Queen in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art at New York; the basalt statue of Thutmose III in the
Cairo Museum; the lion sphinx of Amenhotep III in the British Museum;
the limestone seated Ikhnaton in the Louvre; the granite statue of
Rameses II in Turin;* the perfect crouching figure of the same
incredible monarch making an offering to the gods; 1 ™ the meditative
cow of Der -el-Bahri, which Maspero considered “equal, if not superior,
to the best achievements of Greece and Rome in this genre”;™ the two
lions of Amenhotep III, wh ich Ruskin ranked as the best animal statuary
surviving from antiquity ; 201 the colossi cut into the rocks at Abu
Simbel by the sculptors of Rameses II; the amaz- ing remains found among
the ruins of the artist Thutmose’s studio at Tell - el-Amama — a p
laster model of Ikhnaton’s head, full of the mysticism and poetry of
that tragic king, the lovely limestone bust of Ikhnaton’s Queen,
Nofretete, and the even finer sandstone head of the same fair lady : 202
these scattered examples may illustrate the sculptural accomplishments
of this abounding Empire age. Amid all these lofty masterpieces humor
continues to find place; Egyptian sculptors frolic with jolly
caricatures of men and animals, and even the kings and queens, in
Ikhnaton’s iconoclastic age, a re made to smile and play.</p>
<p>After Rameses II this magnificence passed rapidly away. For many</p>
<p>centuries after him art contented itself with repeating traditional
works and forms. Under the Saite kings it sought to rejuvenate itself by

Sculptors attacked bravely the hardest stones — basalt, breccia,
serpentine, diorite — and carved them into such realistic portraits as
that of Montumihait , 203 and the green basalt head of a bald unknown,
now looking out blackly upon the walls of the State Museum at Berlin. In
bronze they cast the lovely figure of the lady Tekoschet. 20 * Again
they delighted in catching the actual features and movements of men and
beasts; they moulded laughable figures of quaint animals, slaves and
gods; and they formed in bronze a cat and a goat’s head which are among
the trophies of Berlin. 2 ” Then the Persians came down like a wolf on
the fold, conquered Egypt, desecrated its temples, broke its spirit, and
put an end to its art.</p>
<p>These — architecture and sculpture* — are the major Egyptian arts;
but if abundance counted, bas-relief would have to be added to them. No
other people so tirelessly carved its history or legends upon its walls.
At first we are shocked by the dull similarity of these glyptic
narratives, the crowded confusion, the absence of proportion and
perspective — or the ungainly attempt to achieve this by representing
the far above the near; we are surprised to see how tall the Pharaoh is,
and how small are his enemies; and, as in the sculpture, we find it hard
to adjust our pictorial habits to eyes and breasts that face us boldly,
while noses, chins and feet turn coldly away. But then we find ourselves
caught by the perfect line and grace of the falcon and serpent carved on
King W enephes’ tomb, 20 ” by the limestone reliefs of King Zoser on the
Step-Pyramid at Sakkara, by the wood-relief of Prince Hesire from his
grave in the same locality , 207 and by the wounded Libyan on a Fifth
Dynasty tomb at Abusir 203 — a patient study of muscles taut in pain. At
last we bear with equanimity the long reliefs that tell how Thutmose III
and Rameses II carried all before them; we recognize the perfection of
flowing line in the reliefs carved for Seti I at Abydos and Kamak; and
we follow with interest the picturesque en- gravings wherein the
sculptors of Hatshepsut tell on the walls of Der-el- Bahri the story of
the expedition sent by her to the mysterious land of Punt (Somaliland?).
We see the long ships with full-spread sail and serried oars heading
south amid waters alive with octopi, Crustacea and other toilers of the
sea; we watch the fleet arriving on the shores of Punt, wel- comed by a
startled but fascinated people and Icing; we see the sailors</p>

jest of the Punt workman — “Be careful of your feet, you over there;
look out!” Then we accompany the heavy -laden vessels as they return

la nd of Punt, all the odoriferous trees of the lands of the gods,
incense, ebony, ivory, gold, woods of divers kinds, cosmetics for the
eyes, monkeys, dogs, panther skins, . . . never have like things been
brought back for any king from the beginning of the world.” The ships
come through the great canal between the Red Sea and the Nile; we see
the expedition landing at the docks of Thebes, depositing its varied
cargo at the very feet of the Queen. And lastly we are shown, as if
after the lapse of time, all these imported goods beautifying Egypt: on
every side ornaments of gold and ebony, boxes of perfumes and unguents,
elephants’ tusks and animals’ hides; while the trees brought back from
Punt are flourishing so well on the soil of Thebes that under their
branches oxen enjoy the shade. It is one of the supreme reliefs in the
history of art. 809 *</p>
<p>Bas-relief is a liaison between sculpture and painting. In Egypt,
except during the reign of the Ptolemies and under the influence of
Greece, paint- ing never rose to the status of an independent art; it
remained an accessory to architecture, sculpture and relief — the
painter filled in the outlines carved by the cutting tool. But though
subordinate, it was ubiquitous; most statues were painted, all surfaces
were colored. It is an art perilously subject to time, and lacking the
persistence of statuary and building. Very little re- mains to us of Old
Kingdom painting beyond a remarkable picture of six geese from a tomb at
Medum ; 810 but from this alone we are justified in be- lieving that
already in the early dynasties this art, too, had come near to
perfection. In the Middle Kingdom we find distemper paintingt of a</p>
<p>delightful decorative effect in the tombs of Ameni and Khnumhotep at
Beni-Hasan, a nd such excellent examples of the art as the “Gazelles and
the Peasants ,” 811 and the “Cat Watching the Prey”; 818 here again the
artist has caught the main point — that his creations must move and
live. Under the Empire the tombs became a riot of painting. The Egyptian
artist had now developed every color in the rainbow, and was anxious to
display his skill. On the walls and ceilings of homes, temples, palaces
and graves he</p>

<p>tried to portray refreshingly the life of the sunny fields — birds in
flight through the air, fishes swimming in the sea, beasts of the jungle
in their native haunts. Floors were painted to look like transparent
pools, and ceil- ings sought to rival the jewelry of the sky. Around
these pictures were borders of geometric or floral design, ranging from
a quiet simplicity to the most fascinating complexity . 213 The “Dancing
Girl ,” 214 so full of orig inality and esprit , the “Bird Hunt in a
Boat ,” 215 the slim, naked beauty in ochre, mingling with other
musicians in the T omb of Nakht at Thebes 2 ’ 5 — these are stray
samples of the painted population of the graves. Here, as in the
bas-reliefs, the line is good and the composition poor; the participants
in an action, whom we should portray as intermingled, are represented
separately in succession ” 2 superposition is again preferred to
perspective; the stiff formalism and conventions of Egyptian sculpture
are the order of the day, and do not reveal that enlivening humor and
realism which distinguish the later statuary. But through these pictures
runs a freshness of conception, a flow of line and execution, a fidelity
to the life and move- ment of natural things, and a joyous exuberance of
color and ornament, which make them a delight to the eye and the spirit.
With all its short- comings Egyptian painting would never be surpassed
by any Oriental civilization until the middle dynasties of China.</p>
<p>The minor arts were the major art of Egypt. The same skill and energy
that had built Kamak and the Pyramids, and had crowded the temples with
a populace of stone, devoted itself also to the internal beautification
of the home, the adornment of the body, and the development of all the
graces of life. Weavers made rugs, tapestries and cushions rich in color
and incredibly fine in texture; the designs which they created passed
down into Syria, and are used there to this day . 213 The relics of
Tutenkhamon’s tomb have revealed the astonishing luxury of Egyptian
furniture, the ex- quisite finish of every piece and part, chairs
covered gaudily with silver and gold, beds of sumptuous workmanship and
design, jewel-boxes and perfume-baskets of minute artistry, and vases
that only China would excel. Tables bore costly vessels of silver, gold
and bronze, crystal goblets, and sparkling bowls of diorite so finely
ground that the light shone through their stone walls. The alabaster
vessels of Tutenkhamon, and the perfect lotus cups and drinking bowls
unearthed amid the ruins of Amenhotep Ill’s villa at Thebes, indicate to
wha t a high level the ceramic art was raised. Finally the jewelers of
the Middle Kingdom and the Empire brought forth a profusion of precious
ornaments seldom surpassed in design and</p>

<p>workmanship. Necklaces, crowns, rings, bracelets, mirrors, pectorals,
chains, medallions; gold and silver, carnelian and felspar, lapis lazuli
and amethyst — everything is here. The rich Egyptians took the same
pleasure as the Japanese in the beauty of the little things that
surrounded them; every square of ivory on their jewel-boxes had to be
carved in relief and refined in precise detail. They dressed simply, but
they lived completely. And when their day’s work was done they refreshed
themselves with music softly played on lutes, harps, sistrums, flutes
and lyres.* Temples and palaces had orchestras and choirs, and on the
Pharaoh’s staff was a “superintendent of singing” who organized players
and musicians for the entertainment of the king. There is no trace of a
musical notation in Egypt, but this may be merely a lacuna in the
remains. Snefrunofr and Re’mery -Ptah were the Carusos and De Reszkes of
their day, and across the centuries we hear their boast that they
“fulfil every wish of the king by their beautiful singing .””®</p>
<p>It is exceptional that their names survive, for in most cases the
artists whose labors preserved the features or memory of princes,
priests and kings had no means of transmitting their own names to
posterity. We hear of Imhotep, the almost mythic al architect of Zoser’s
reign; of Ineni, who designed great buildings like Der-el-Bahri for
Thutmose I; of Puymre and Hapuseneb and Senmut, who carried on the
architectural enterprises of Queen Hatshepsut,f of the artist Thutmose,
in whose studio so many masterpieces have been found; and of Bek, the
proud sculptor who tells us, in Gautier’s strain, that he has saved
Ikhnaton from oblivion. 2 ” Amen - hotep III had as his chief architect
another Amenhotep, son of Hapu; the Pharaoh placed almost limitless
wealth at the disposal of his talents, and this favored artist became so
famous that later Egypt worshiped him as a god. For the most part,
however, the artist worked in obscurity and poverty, and was ranked no
higher than other artisans or handicraftsmen by the priests and
potentates who engaged him.</p>
<p>Egyptian religion cooperated with Egyptian wealth to inspire and
foster art, and cooperated with Egypt’s loss of empire and affluence to
ruin it. Religion offered motives, ideas and the inspiration; but it
imposed con-</p>

<p>ventions and restraints which bound art so completely to the church
that when sincere religion died among the artists, the arts that had
lived on it died too. This is the tragedy of almost every civilization —
that its soul is in its faith, and seldom survives philosophy.</p>

<p>The Instructions of Ptah- hotep”—The “ Admonitions of IpuiveP*</p>
<p>—The “ Dialogue of a Misanthrope”— The Egyptian Ecclesiastes</p>
<p>Historians of philosophy have been wont to begin their story with the
Greeks. The Hindus, who believe that they invented philosophy, and the
Chinese, who believe that they perfected it, smile at our provincialism.
It may be that we are all mistaken; for among the most ancient fragments
left to us by the Egyptians are writings that belong, however loosely
and untechnically, under the rubric of moral philosophy. The wisdom of
the Egyptians was a proverb with the Greeks, who felt themselves
children beside this ancient race.* 0</p>
<p>The oldest work of philosophy known to us is the “Instructions of
Ptah - hotep,” which apparently goes back to 2880 b.c.— 2300 years
before Con- fucius, Socrates and Buddha.* 13 Ptah-hotep was Governor of
Memphis, and Prime Minister to the King, under the Fifth Dynasty.
Retiring from office, he decided to leave to his son a manual of
everlasting wisdom. It was transcribed as an antique classic by some
scholars prior to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The Vizier begins:</p>
<p>O Prince my Lord, the end of life is at hand; old age descendeth</p>
<p>upon me; feebleness cometh and childishness is renewed; he that is
old lieth down in misery every day. The eyes are small, the ears are</p>
<p>deaf. Energy is diminished, the heart hath no rest. . . . Command thy
servant, therefore, to make over my princely authority to my son.</p>
<p>Let me speak unto him the words of them that hearken to the coun- sel
of the men of old time, those that once heard the gods. I pray</p>
<p>thee, let this thing be done.</p>
<p>His Gracious Majesty grants the permission, advising him, however, to
“discourse without causing weariness”— advice not yet superfluous for
philosophers. Whereupon Ptah-hotep instructs his son:</p>
<p>Be not proud because thou art learned; but discourse with the ig-</p>
<p>norant man as with the sage. For no limit can be set to skill,
neither</p>
<p>194</p>

<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>is there any craftsman that possesseth full advantages. Fair speech
is more rare than the emerald that is found by slave-maidens among the
pebbles. . . . Live, therefore, in the house of kindliness, and men
shall come and give gifts of themselves. . . . Beware of making enmity
by</p>
<p>thy words. . . . Overstep not the truth, neither repeat that
which</p>
<p>any man, be he prince or peasant, saith in opening the heart; it
is</p>
<p>abhorrent to the soul. …</p>
<p>If thou wouldst be a wise man, beget a son for the pleasing of
the</p>
<p>god. If he make straight his course after thine example, if he
ar-</p>
<p>range thine affairs in due order, do all unto him that is good.</p>
<p>… If he be heedless and trespass thy rules of conduct, and is
vio-</p>
<p>lent; if every speech that cometh from his mouth is a vile word;</p>
<p>then beat thou him, that his talk may be fitting. . . . Precious to
a</p>
<p>man is the virtue of his son, and good character is a thing
remem-</p>
<p>bered. . . .</p>
<p>Wheresover thou goest, beware of consorting with women. . . .</p>
<p>If thou wouldst be wise, provide for thine house, and love thy
wife</p>
<p>that is in thine arms. . . . Silence is more profitable to thee
than</p>
<p>abundance of speech. Consider how thou mayest be opposed by an expert
that speaketh in council. It is a foolish thing to speak on</p>
<p>every kind of work. . . .</p>
<p>If thou be powerful make thyself to be honored for knowledge</p>
<p>and for gentleness. . . . Beware of interruption, and of
answering</p>
<p>words with heat; put it from thee; control thyself.</p>
<p>And Ptah-hotep concludes with Horatian pride:</p>
<p>Nor shall any word that hath here been set down cease out of this</p>
<p>land forever, but shall be made a pattern whereby princes shall speak
well. My words shall instruct a man how he shall speak; . . . yea,
he</p>
<p>shall become as one skilful in obeying, excellent in speaking.
Good</p>
<p>fortune shall befall him; … he shall be gracious until the end of
his</p>
<p>life; he shall be contented always . 224</p>
<p>This note of good cheer does not persist in Egyptian thought; age
comes upon it quickly, and sours it. Another sage, Ipuwer, bemoans the
disorder, violence, famine and decay that attended the passing of the
Old Kingdom; he tells of sceptics who “would make offerings if” they
“knew where the god is”; he comments upon increasing suicide, and adds,
like another Schopenhauer: “Would that there might be an end of men,
that there</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>*95</p>
<p>might be no conception, no birth. If the land would but cease from
noise, and strife be no more ,, — it is clear that Ipuwer was tired and
old. In the end he dreams of a philosopher-king who will redeem men from
chaos and injustice:</p>
<p>He brings cooling to the flame (of the social conflagration?). It
is</p>
<p>said he is the shepherd of all men. There is no evil in his
heart.</p>
<p>When his herds are few he passes the day to gather them together,</p>
<p>their hearts being fevered. Would that he had discerned their
char-</p>
<p>acter in the first generation. Then would he have smitten evil.
He</p>
<p>would have stretched forth his arm against it. He would have</p>
<p>smitten the seed thereof and their inheritance. . . . Where is he
to-</p>
<p>day? Doth he sleep perchance? Behold, his might is not seen . 225</p>
<p>This already is the voice of the prophets; the lines are cast into
strophic form, like the prophetic writings of the Jews; and Breasted
properly acclaims these “Admonitions” as “the earliest emergence of a
social idealism whic h among the Hebrews we call ‘Messianism.’ ,,22 °
Another scroll from the Middle Kingdom denounces the corruption of the
age in words that almost every generation hears:</p>
<p>To whom do I speak today?</p>
<p>Brothers are evil,</p>
<p>Friends of today are not of love.</p>
<p>To whom do I speak today?</p>
<p>Hearts are thievish,</p>
<p>Every man seizes his neighbor’s goods.</p>
<p>To whom do I speak today?</p>
<p>The gentle man perishes,</p>
<p>The bold-faced goes everywhere. . . .</p>
<p>To whom do I speak today?</p>
<p>When a man should arouse wrath by his evil conduct</p>
<p>He stirs all men to mirth, although his iniquity is wicked. . . .</p>
<p>And then this Egyptian Swinburne pours out a lovely eulogy of
death:</p>
<p>Death is before me today</p>
<p>Like the recovery of a sick man,</p>
<p>Like going forth into a garden after sickness.</p>
<p>Death is before me today</p>
<p>Like the odor of myrrh,</p>
<p>Like sitting under the sail on a windy day.</p>

<p>Saddest of all is a poem engraved upon a slab now in the Leyden</p>

<p>This pessimism and scepticism were the result, it may be, of the
broken spirit of a nation humiliated and subjected by the Hyksos
invaders; they bear the same relation to Egypt that Stoicism and
Epicureanism bear to a defeated and enslaved Greece.* In part such
literature represents one of those interludes, like our own moral
interregnum, in which thought has for a time overcome belief, and men no
longer know how or why they should live. Such periods do not endure;
hope soon wins the victory over thought; the intellect is put down to
its customary menial place, and religion is bom again, giving to men the
imaginative stimulus apparently indispensable to life and work. We need
not suppose that such poems expressed the views of any large number of
Egyptians; behind and around the small but vital minority that pondered
the problems of life and death in secular and naturalistic terms were
millions of simple men and women who remained faithful to the gods, and
never doubted that right would triumph, that every earthly pain and
grief would be atoned for bountifully in a haven of happiness and
peace.</p>

<p>19^ THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>gods whose wills — not always concordant — ordained their complex and
varied movements. 2 ” The sky itself was a vault, across whose vastness
a great cow stood, who was the goddess Hathor; the earth lay beneath her
feet, and her belly was clad in the beauty of ten thousand stars. Or
(for the gods and myths differed from nome to nome) the sky was the god
Sibu, lying tenderly upon the earth, which was the goddess Nuit; from
their gigantic copulation all things had been bom. 2 ” Constellations
and stars might be gods: for example, Sahu and Sopdit (Orion and Sirius)
were tremendous deities; Sahu ate gods three times a day regularly.
Occasionally some such monster ate the moon, but only for a moment; soon
the prayers of men and the anger of the other gods forced the greedy sow
to vomit it up again . 231 In this manner the Egyptian populace
explained an eclipse of the moon.</p>
<p>The moon was a god, perhaps the oldest of all that were worshiped in
Egypt; but in the official theology the greatest of the gods was the
sun. Sometimes it was worshiped as the supreme deity Ra or Re, the
bright father who fertilized Mother Earth with rays of penetrating heat
and light; sometimes it was a divine calf, bom anew at every dawn,
sailing the sky slowly in a celestial boat, and descending into the
west, at evening, like an old man tottering to his grave. Or the sun was
the god Horus, taking the graceful form of a falcon, flying majestically
across the heavens day after day as if in supervision of his realm, and
becoming one of the recurrent symbols of Egyptian religion and royalty.
Always Ra, or the sun, was the Creator: at his first rising, seeing the
earth desert and bare, he had flooded it with his energizing rays, and
all living things — vegetable, animal and human — had sprung pell-mell
from his eyes, and been scattered over the world. The earliest men and
women, being direct children of Ra, had been perfect and happy; by
degrees their descendants had taken to evil ways, and had forfeited this
perfection and happiness; whereupon Ra, dissatisfied with his creatures,
had destroyed a large part of the human race. Learned Egyptians
questioned this popular belief, and asserted on the contrary (like
certain Sumerian scholars), that the first men had been like brutes,
without articulate speech or any of the arts of life . 232 All in all it
was an intelligent mythology, expressing piously man’s gratitude to
earth and sun.</p>
<p>So exuberant was this piety that the Egyptians worshiped not merely
the source, but almost every form, of life. Many plants were sacred to
them: the palm-tree that shaded them amid the desert, the spring
that</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>*99</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>gave them drink in the oasis, the grove where they could meet and
rest, the sycamore flourishing miraculously in the sand; these were,
with ex- cellent reason, holy things, and to the end of his civilization
the simple Egyptian brought them offerings of cucumbers, grapes and figs
. 233 Even the lowly vegetable’ found its devotees; and Taine amused
himself by showing how the onion that so displeased Bossuet had been a
divinity on the banks of the Nile . 231</p>
<p>More popular were the animal gods; they were so numerous that they
filled the Egyptian pantheon like a chattering menagerie. In one nome or
another, in one period or another, Egyptians worshiped the bull, the
croco- dile, the hawk, the cow, the goose, the goat, the ram, the cat,
the dog, the chicken, the swallow, the jackal, the serpent, and allowed
some of these creatures to roam in the temples with the same freedom
that is accorded to the sacred cow in India today . 233 When the gods
became human they still retained animal doubles and symbols: Amon was
repre- sented as a goose or a ram, Ra as a grasshopper or a bull, Osiris
as a bull or a ram, Sebek as a crocodile, Horus as a hawk or falcon,
Hathor as a cow, and Thoth, the god of wisdom, as a baboon . 230
Sometimes women were offered to certain of these animals as sexual
mates; the bull in par- ticular, as the incarnation of Osiris, received
this honor; and at Mendes, says Plutarch, the most beautiful women were
offered in coitus to the divine goat . 237 From beginning to end this
totemism remained as an essential and native element in Egyptian
religion; human gods came to Egypt much later, and probably as gifts
from western Asia . 233</p>
<p>The goat and the bull were especially sacred to the Egyptians as
repre- senting sexual creative power; they were not merely symbols of
Osiris, but incarnations of him . 230 Often Osiris was depicted with
large and prom- inent organs, as a mark of his supreme power; and models
of him in this form, or with a triple phallus, were borne in religious
processions by the Egyptians; on certain occasions the women carried
such phallic images, and operated them mechanically with strings. 210 *
Signs of sex worship appear not only in the many cases in which figures
are depicted, on temple reliefs, with erect organs, but in the frequent
appearance, in Egyptian symbolism, of the crux ansata — a cross with a
handle, as a sign of sexual union and vigorous life . 211</p>
<p>At last the gods became human — or rather, men became gods. Like the

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>deities of Greece, the personal gods of Egypt were merely superior
men and women, made in heroic mould, but composed of bone and muscle,
flesh and blood; they hungered and ate, thirsted and drank, loved and
mated, hated and killed, grew old and died. 41 * There was Osiris, for
ex- ample, god of the beneficent Nile, whose death and resurrection were
celebrated yearly as symbolizing the fall and rise of the river, and
perhaps the decay and growth of the soil. Every Egyptian of the later
dynasties could tell the story of how Set (or Sit), the wicked god of
desiccation, who shriveled up harvests with his burning breath, was
angered at Osiris (the Nile) for extending (with his overflow) the
fertility of the earth, slew him, and reigned in dry majesty over
Osiris’ kingdom (i.e., the river once failed to rise), until Horus,
brave son of Isis, overcame Set and</p>
<p>banished him; whereafter Osiris, brought back to life by the warmth
of Isis ’ love, ruled benevolently over Egypt, suppressed cannibalism,
estab - lished civilization, and then ascended to heaven to reign there
endlessly as a god . 418 It was a profound myth; for history, like
Oriental religion, is dualistic — a record of the conflict between
creation and destruction, fer- tility and desiccation, rejuvenation and
exhaustion, good and evil, life and death.</p>
<p>Profound, too, was the myth of Isis, the Great Mother. She was
not</p>
<p>only the loyal sister and wife of Osiris; in a sense she was greater
than he, for — like woman in general — she had conquered death through
love. Nor was she merely the black soil of the Delta, fertilized by the
touch of</p>
<p>Osiris-Nile, and making all Egypt rich with her fecundity. She was,
above all, the symbol of that mysterious creative power which had
produced the earth and every living thing, and of that maternal
tenderness whereby, at whatever cost to the mother, the young new life
is nurtured to maturity. She represented in Egypt — as Kali, Ishtar and
Cybele represented in Asia, Demeter in Greece, and Ceres in Rome — the
original priority and independence of the female principle in creation
and in inheritance, and the originative leadership of woman in tilling
the earth; for it was Isis (said the myth) who had discovered wheat and
barley growing wild in Egypt, and had revealed them to Osiris (man ).
414 The Egyptians wor- shiped her with especial fondness and piety, and
raised up jeweled images to her as the Mother of God; her tonsured
priests praised her in sonorous matins and vespers; and in midwinter of
each year, coincident with the annual rebirth of the sun towards the end
of our December, the temples</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>of her divine child, Horus (god of the sun), showed her, in holy
effigy, nursing in a stable the babe that she had miraculously
conceived. These poetic-philosophic legends and symbols profoundly
affected Christian ritual and theology. Early Christians sometimes
worshiped before the statues of Isis suckling the infant Horus, seeing
in them another form of the ancient and noble myth by which woman (i.e.,
the female principle), creating all things, becomes at last the Mother
of God .“ 5</p>
<p>These — Ra (or, as he was called in the South, Amon), Osiris, Isis
and Horus — were the greater gods of Egypt. In later days Ra, Amon and
another god, Ptah, were combined as three embodiments or aspects of one
supreme and triune deity . 248 There were countless lesser divinities:
Anubis the jackal, Shu, Tefnut, Nephthys, Ket, Nut; . . . but we must
not make these pages a museum of dead gods. Even Pharaoh was a god,
always the son of Amon-Ra, ruling not merely by divine right but by
divine birth, as a deity transiently tolerating the earth as his home.
On his head was the falcon, symbol of Horus and totem of the tribe; from
his forehead rose the ur&lt;eus or serpent, symbol of wisdom and life,
and communicating magic virtues to the crown . 247 The king was chief
-priest of the faith, and led the great processions and ceremonies that
celebrated the festivals of the gods. It was through this assumption of
divine lineage and powers that he was able to rule so long with so
little force.</p>
<p>Hence the priests of Egypt were the necessary props of the
throne,</p>
<p>and the secret police of the social order. Given a faith of such
complexity, a class had to arise adept in magic and ritual, whose skill
would make it indispensable in approaching the gods. In effect, though
not in law, the office of priest passed down from father to son, and a
class grew up which, through the piety of the people and the politic
generosity of the kings, became in time richer and stronger than the
feudal aristocracy or the royal family itself. The sacrifices offered to
the gods supplied the priests with food and drink; the temple buildings
gave them spacious homes; the revenues of temple lands and services
furnished them with ample incomes; and their exemption from forced
labor, military service, and ordinary taxation, left them in an enviable
position of prestige and power. They deserved not a little of this
power, for they accumulated and preserved the learning of Egypt,
educated the youth, and disciplined themselves with rigor and zeal.
Herodotus describes them almost with awe:</p>
<p>202 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>They are of all men the most excessively attentive to the worship</p>
<p>of the gods, and observe the following ceremonies. . . . They
wear</p>
<p>linen garments, constantly fresh-washed. . . . They are
circumcised</p>
<p>for the sake of cleanliness, thinking it better to be clean than
hand-</p>
<p>some. They shave their whole body every third day, that neither</p>
<p>lice nor any other impurity may be found upon them. . . . They</p>
<p>wash themselves in cold water twice every day and twice every</p>
<p>night .” 8</p>
<p>What distinguished this religion above everything else was its
emphasis on immortality. If Osiris, the Nile, and all vegetation, might
rise again, so might man. The amazing preservation of the dead body in
the dry soil of Egypt lent some encouragement to this belief, which was
to dominate Egyptian faith for thousands of years, and to pass from it,
by its own resurrection, into Christianity The body, Egypt believed, was
inhabited by a small replica of itself called the ka, and also by a soul
that dwelt in the body like a bird flitting among trees. All of these —
body, ka and soul- survived the appearance of death; they could escape
mortality for a time in proportion as the flesh was preserved from
decay; but if they came to Osiris clean of all sin they would be
permitted to live forever in the</p>
<p>“Happy Field of Food”— those heavenly gardens where there would
always be abundance and security: judge the harassed penury that spoke
in this consoling dream. These Elysian Fields, however, could be reached
only through the services of a ferryman, an Egyptian prototype of
Charon; and this old gentleman would receive into his boat only such men
and women as had done no evil in their lives. Or Osiris would question
the dead, weighing each candidate’s heart in the scale against a feather
to test his truthfulness. Those who failed in this final examination
would be condemned to lie forever in their tombs, hungering and
thirsting, fed upon by hideous crocodiles, and never coming forth to see
the sun.</p>
<p>According to the priests there were clever ways of passing these
tests; and they offered to reveal these ways for a consideration. One
was to fit up the tomb with food, drink and servants to nourish and help
the dead. Another was to fill the tomb with talismans pleasing to the
gods: fish, vultures, snakes, above all, the scarab — a beetle which,
because it repro- duced itself apparently with fertilization, typified
the resurrected soul; if these were properly blessed by a priest they
would frighten away every assailant, and annihilate every evil. A still
better way was to buy the</p>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>20 3</p>
<p>Book of the Dead * scrolls for which the priests had written prayers,
for- mulas and charms calculated to appease, even to deceive, Osiris.
When, after a hundred vicissitudes and perils, the dead soul at last
reached Osiris, it was to address the great Judge in some such manner as
this:</p>
<p>O Thou who speedest Time’s advancing wing,</p>
<p>Thou dweller in all mysteries of life,</p>
<p>Thou guardian of every word I speak —</p>
<p>Behold, Thou art ashamed of me, thy son;</p>
<p>Thy heart is full of sorrow and of shame,</p>
<p>For that my sins were grievous in the world,</p>
<p>And proud my wickedness and my transgression.</p>
<p>Oh, be at peace with me, oh, be at peace,</p>
<p>And break the barriers that loom between us!</p>
<p>Let all my sins be washed away and fall</p>
<p>Forgotten to the right and left of thee!</p>
<p>Yea, do away with all my wickedness,</p>
<p>And put away the shame that fills thy heart,</p>
<p>That Thou and I henceforth may be at peace . 251</p>
<p>Or t he soul was to declare its innocence of all major sins, in a
“Negative Confession” that represents for us one of the earliest and
noblest expressions of the moral sense in man:</p>
<p>Hail to Thee, Great God, Lord of Truth and Justice! I have</p>
<p>come before Thee, my Master; I have been brought to see thy</p>
<p>beauties. … I bring unto you Truth. … I have not committed in-</p>
<p>iquity against men. I have not oppressed the poor. … I have not</p>
<p>laid labor upon any free man beyond that which he wrought for</p>
<p>himself. … I have not defaulted, I have not committed that which</p>
<p>is an abomination to the gods. I have not caused the slave to be
ill-</p>
<p>treated of his master. I have not starved any man, I have not
made</p>
<p>any to weep, I have not assassinated any man, … I have not com-</p>

They date from the Pyramids, but some are even older. The Egyptians
believed that these texts had been composed by the god of wisdom, Thoth;
chapter lxiv announced that the book had been found at Heliopolis, and
was “in the very handwriting of the god .” 280 Josiah made a similar
discovery among the Jews; cf. Chap, xn, § v below.</li>

<p>not taken with nets the birds of the gods … I am pure. I am pure.</p>
<p>I am pure .® 3</p>
<p>For the most part, however, Egyptian religion had little to say about
morality; the priests were busier selling charms, mumbling incantations,
and performing magic rites than inculcating ethical precepts. Even the
Book of the Dead teaches the faithful that charms blessed by the clergy
will overcome all the obstacles that the deceased soul may encounter on
its way to salvation; and the emphasis is rather on reciting the prayers
than on living the good life. Says one roll: “If this can be k nown
by</p>
<p>the deceased he shall come forth by day”— i.e., rise to eternal life.
Amulets and incantations were designed and sold to cover a multitude of
sins and secure the entrance of the Devil himself into Paradise. At
every step the pious Egyptian had to mutter strange formulas to avert
evil and attract the good. Hear, for example, an anxious mother trying
to drive out</p>
<p>“demons” from her child:</p>
<p>Run out, thou who comest in darkness, who enterest in stealth.</p>
<p>. . . Comest thou to kiss this child? I will not let thee kiss
him.</p>
<p>. . . Comest thou to take him away? I will not let thee take him</p>
<p>away from me. I have made his protection against thee out of</p>
<p>Efet-herb, which makes pain; out of onions, which harm thee; out</p>
<p>of honey, which is sweet to the living and bitter to the dead;
out</p>
<p>of the evil parts of the Ebdu fish; out of the backbone of the</p>
<p>perch .® 8</p>
<p>The gods themselves used magic and charms against one another. The
literature of Egypt is full of magicians — of wizards who dry up lakes
with a word, or cause severed limbs to jump back into place, or raise
the dead . 364 The king had magicians to help or guide him; and he
himself was believed to have a magical power to make the rain fall, or
the river rise .” 5 Life was full of talismans, spells, divinations;
every door had to have a god to frighten away evil spirits or fortuitous
strokes of bad luck. Children bom on the twenty-third of the month of
Thoth would surely die soon; those born on the twentieth of Choiakh
would go blind. 3 “ “Eac h day and</p>
<p>EGYPT</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII)</p>
<p>month,” says Herodotus, “is assigned to some particular god; and
accord - ing to the day on which each person is bom, they determine what
will befall him, how he will die, and what kind of person he will be.”*”
In the end the connection between morality and religion tended to be
for- gotten; the road to eternal bliss led not through a good life, but
through magic, ritual, and generosity to the priests. Let a great
Egyptologist ex- press the matter:</p>
<p>The dangers of the hereafter were now greatly multiplied, and</p>
<p>for every critical situation the priest was able to furnish the
dead</p>
<p>with an effective charm which would infallibly cure him. Besides</p>
<p>many charms which enabled the dead to reach the world of the</p>
<p>hereafter, there were those which prevented him from losing his</p>
<p>mouth, his head, his heart; others which enabled him to remember</p>
<p>his name, to breathe, eat, drink, avoid eating his own foulness,
to</p>
<p>prevent his drinking-water from turning into flame, to turn dark-</p>
<p>ness into light, to ward off all serpents and other hostile
monsters,</p>
<p>and many others. . . . Thus the earliest moral development which</p>
<p>we can trace in the ancient East was suddenly arrested, or at
least</p>
<p>checked, by the detestable devices of a corrupt priesthood eager</p>
<p>for gain.* 8</p>
<p>Such was the state of religion in Egypt when Ikhnaton, poet and
heretic, came to the throne, and inaugurated the religious revolution
that destroyed the Empire of Egypt.</p>

<p>III, died after a life of wordly luxury and display, and was followed
by his son Amenhotep IV, destined to be known as Ikhnaton. A profoundly
revealing portrait-bust of him, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna, shows a
profile of incredible delicacy, a face feminine in softness and poetic
in its sensitivity. Large eyelids like a dreamer’s, a long, misshapen
skull, a frame slender and weak: here was a Shelley called to be a
king.</p>
<p>20 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>He had hardly come to power when he began to revolt against the</p>
<p>religion of Amon, and the practices of Amon’s priests. In the great
temple at Kamak there was now a large harem, supposedly the concubines
of Amon, but in reality serving to amuse the clergy .“ s “ The young
emperor, whose private life was a model of fidelity, did not approve of
this sacred harlotry; the blood of the ram slaughtered in sacrifice to
Amon stank in his nostrils; and the traffic of the priests in magic and
charms, and their use of the oracle of Amon to support religious
obscurantism and political corruption 259 disgusted him to the point of
violent protest. “More evil are the words of the priests,” he said,
“than those which I heard until the year IV” (of his reign) ; “more evil
are they than those which King Amenhotep III heard .” 260 His youthful
spirit rebelled against the sordidness into which the religion of his
people had fallen; he abominated the indecent wealth and lavish ritual
of the temples, and the growing hold of a mercenary hierarchy on the
nation’s life. With a poet’s audacity he threw compromise to the winds,
and announced bravely that all these gods and ceremonies were a vulgar
idolatry, that there was but one god — Aton.</p>
<p>Like Akbar in India thirty centuries later, Ikhnaton saw divinity
above all in the sun, in the source of all earthly life and light. We
cannot tell whether he had adopted his theory from Syria, and whether
Aton was merely a form of Adonis. Of whatever origin, the new god filled
the</p>
<p>king’s soul with delight; he changed his own name from Amenh otep,
which contained the name of Amon, to Ikhnaton, meaning “Aton is
satisfied”; and helping himself with old hymns, and certain monotheistic
poems pub- lished in the preceding reign,* he composed passionate songs
to Aton, of which this, the longest and the best, is the fairest
surviving remnant of Egyptian literature:</p>
<p>Thy dawning is beautiful in the horizon of the sky,</p>
<p>O living Aton, Beginning of life.</p>
<p>When thou risest in the eastern horizon,</p>
<p>Thou fillest every land with thy beauty.</p>
<p>Thou art beautiful, great, glittering, high above every land.</p>
<p>Thy rays, they encompass the land, even all that thou hast made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under Amenhotep m the architects Suti and Hor had inscribed a
monotheistic hymn to the sun upon a stele now in the British Museum .
281 It had long been the custom in Egypt to address the sun-god,
Amon-Ra, as the greatest god , 282 but only as the god of Egypt.</li>

<p>210 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>This is not only one of the great poems of history, it is the first
out-</p>
<p>standing expression of monotheism — seven hundred years before
Isaiah.* Perhaps, as Breasted” 8 suggests, this conception of one sole
god was a reflex of the unification of the Mediterranean world under
Egypt by Thutmose III. Ikhnaton conceives his god as belonging to all
nations</p>
<p>equally, and even names other countries before his own as in Aton’s
care; this was an astounding advance upon the old tribal deities. Note
the vitalistic conception: Aton is to be found not in battles and
victories but in flowers and trees, in all forms of life and growth;
Aton is the joy that causes the young sheep to “dance upon their legs,”
and the birds to “flutter in their marshes.” Nor is the god a person
limited to human form; the real divinity is the creative and nourishing
heat of the sun; the flaming glory of the rising or setting orb is but
an emblem of that ultimate power. Nevertheless, because of its
omnipresent, fertilizing beneficence, the sun becomes to Ikhnaton also
the “Lord of love,” the tender nurse that “creates the man- child in
woman,” and “fills the Two Lands of Egypt with love.” So at last Aton
grows by symbolism into a solicitous father, compassionate and tender;
not, like Yahveh, a Lord of Hosts, but a god of gentleness and peace.”
8</p>
<p>It is one of the tragedies of history that Ikhnaton, having achieved
his elevating vision of universal unity, was not satisfied to let the
noble quality of his new religion slowly win the hearts of men. He was
unable to</p>
<p>think of his truth in relative terms; the thought came to him that
other forms of belief and worship were indecent and intolerable.
Suddenly he gave orders that the names of all gods but Aton should be
erased and chiseled from every public inscription in Egypt; he m
utilated his father’s name from a hundred monuments to cut from it the
word Amon; he declared all creeds but his own illegal, and commanded
that all the old temples should be closed. He abandoned Thebes as
unclean, and built for himself a beautiful new capital at Akhetaton —
“City of the Horizon of Aton.”</p>
<p>Rapidly Thebes decayed as the offices and emoluments of government
were taken from it, and Akhetaton became a rich metropolis, busy with
fresh building and a Renaissance of arts liberated from the priestly
bondage of tradition. The joyous spirit expressed in the new religion
passed over into its art. At Tell-el-Amarna, a modern village on the
site of Akhetaton,</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious similarity of this hymn to Psalm CIV leaves little doubt
of Egyptian in - fluence upon the Hebrew poet . 204</li>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>Sir William Flinders Petrie unearthed a beautiful pavement, adorned
with birds, fishes and other animals painted with the most delicate
grace.*”</p>
<p>Had Ikhnaton been a mature mind he would have realized that the</p>
<p>change which he had proposed from a superstitious polytheism deeply
rooted in the needs and habits of the people to a naturalistic
monotheism that subjected imagination to intelligence, was too profound
to be effected in a little time; he would have made haste slowly, and
softened the transi- tion with intermediate steps. But he was a poet
rather than a philosopher; like Shelley announcing the demise of Yahveh
to the bishops of Oxford, he grasped for the Absolute, and brought the
whole structure of Egypt down upon his head.</p>
<p>At one blow he had dispossessed and alienated a wealthy and powerful
priesthood, and had forbidden the worship of deities made dear by long
tradition and belief. When he had Avion hacked out from his father’s
name it seemed to his people a blasphemous impiety; nothing could be
more vital to them than the honoring of the ancestral dead. He had
under- estimated the strength and pertinacity of the priests, and he had
exagger- ated the capacity of the people to understand a natural
religion. Behind the scenes the priests plotted and prepared; and in the
seclusion of their homes the populace continued to worship their ancient
and innumerable gods. A hundred crafts that had depended upon the
temples muttered in secret against the heretic. Even in his palace his
ministers and generals hated him, and prayed for his death, for was he
not allowing the Empire to fall to pieces in his hands?</p>
<p>Meanwhile the young poet lived in simplicity and trust. He had seven
daughters, but no son; and though by law he might have sought an heir by
his secondary wives, he would not, but preferred to remain faithful to
Nofretete. A little ornament has come down to us that shows him</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>embracing the Queen; he allowed artists to depict him riding in a
chariot through the streets, engaged in pleasantries with his wife and
children; on ceremonial occasions the Queen sat beside him and held his
hand, while their daughters frolicked at the foot of the throne. He
spoke of his wife as “Mistress of his Happiness, at hearing whose voice
the King rejoices”; and for an oath he used the phrase, “As my heart is
happy in the Queen and her children.” 2 ™ It was a tender interlude in
Egypt’s epic of power.</p>
<p>Into this simple happiness came alarming messages from Syria.* The
dependencies of Egypt in the Near East were being invaded by Hittites
and other neighboring tribes; the governors appointed by Egypt pleaded
for immediate reinforcements. Ikhnaton hesitated; he was not quite sure
that the right of conquest warranted him in keeping these states in sub-
jection to Egypt; and he was loath to send Egyptians to die on distant
fields for so uncertain a cause. When the dependencies saw that they
were dealing with a saint, they deposed their Egyptian governors,
quietly</p>
<p>stopped all payment of tribute, and became to all effects free.
Almost in a moment Egypt ceased to be a vast Empire, and shrank back
into a little state. Soon the Egyptian treasury, which had for a century
depended upon foreign tribute as its mainstay, was empty; domestic
taxation had fallen to a minim um, and the working of the gold mines had
stopped. Internal administration was in chaos. Ikhnaton found himself
penniless and friend- less in a world that had seemed all his own. Every
colony was in revolt, and every power in Egypt was arrayed against him,
waiting for his fall.</p>
<p>He was hardly thirty when, in 1362 B.C., he died, broken with the
reali- zation of his failure as a ruler, and the unworthiness of his
race.</p>

<li>In 1893 Sir William Flinders Petrie discovered at Tell-el-Amarna
over three hundred and fifty cuneiform letter-tablets, most of which
were appeals for aid addressed to Ikhnaton by the East.</li>

<p>Two years after his death his son-in-law, Tutenkhamon, a favorite of
the priests, ascended the throne. He changed the name Tutenkhaton which
his father-in-law had given him, returned the capital to Thebes, made
his peace with the powers of the Church, and announced to a rejoicing
people the restoration of the ancient gods. The words Aton and Ikhnaton
were effaced from all the monuments, the priests forbade the name of the
heretic king to pass any man’s lips, and the people referred to him as
“The Great Criminal.” The names that Ikhnaton had removed were r ecarved
upon the monuments, and the feast-days that he had abolished were
renewed. Everything was as before.</p>
<p>For the rest Tutenkhamon reigned without distinction; the world would
hardly have heard of him had not unprecedented treasures been found in
his grave. After him a doughty general, Harmhab, marched his armies up
and down the coast, restoring Egypt’s external power and internal peace.
Seti I wisely reaped the fruits of renewed order and wealth, built the
Hypostyle Hall at Kamak, 272 began to cut a mighty temple into the
cliffs at Abu Simbel, commemorated his grandeur in magnificent reliefs,
and had the pleasure of lying for thousands of years in one of the most
ornate of Egypt’s tombs.</p>
<p>At this point the romantic Rameses II, last of the great
Pharaohs,</p>
<p>mounted the throne. Seldom has history known so picturesque a
monarch. Handsome and brave, he added to his charms by his boyish
consciousness of them; and his exploits in war, which he never tired of
recording, were equaled only by his achievements in love. After brushing
aside a brother who had inopportune rights to the throne, he sent an
expedition to Nubia to tap the gold mines there and replenish the
treasury of Egypt; and with the resultant funds he undertook the
reconquest of the Asiatic provinces, which had again rebelled. Three
years he gave to recovering Palestine; then he pushed on, met a great
army of the Asiatic allies at Kadesh (1288 b.c.), and turned defeat into
victory by his courage and leadership. It may have been as a result of
these campaigns that a considerable number of Jews were brought into
Egypt, as slaves or as immigrants; and Rameses II</p>
<p>214 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>is believed by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus.*” He had
his victories commemorated, without undue impartiality, on half a
hundred walls, commissioned a poet to celebrate him in epic verse, and
rewarded himself with several hundred wives. When he died he left one
hundred sons and fifty daughters to testify to his quality by their
number and their proportion. He married several of his daughters, so
that they too might have splendid children. His offspring were so
numerous that they con- stituted for four hundred years a special class
in Egypt, from which, for over a century, her rulers were chosen.</p>
<p>He deserved these consolations, for he seems to have ruled Egypt
well. He built so lavishly that half the surviving edifices of Egypt are
ascribed to his reign. He completed the main hall at Karnak, added to
the temple of Luxor, raised his own vast shrine, the Ramesseum, west of
the river, finished the great mountain-sanctuary at Abu Simbel, and
scattered colossi of himself throughout the land. Commerce flourished
under him, both across the Isthmus of Suez and on the Mediterranean. He
built an- other canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, but the shifting
sands filled it up soon after his death. He yielded up his life in 1225
b.c., aged ninety, after one of the most remarkable reigns of
history.</p>
<p>Only one human power in Egypt had excelled his, and that was the</p>
<p>clergy: here, as everywhere in history, ran the endless struggle
between church and state. Throughout his reign and those of his
immediate suc- cessors, the spoils of every war, and the lion’s share of
t axes from the conquered provinces, went to the temples and the
priests. These reached the zenith of their wealth under Rameses III.
They possessed at that time 107,000 slaves — one-thirtieth of the
population of Egypt; they held 750,000 acres — one-seventh of all the
arable land; they owned 500,000 head of cattle; they received the
revenues from 169 towns in Egypt and Syria; and all this property was
exempt from taxation.* 74 The generous or timorous Rameses III showered
unparalleled gifts upon the priests of Amon, including 32,000 kilograms
of gold and a million kilograms of silver;* 78 every year he gave them
185,000 sacks of com. When the time came to pay the workmen employed by
the state he found his treasury empty.* 78 More and more the people
starved in order that the gods might eat.</p>
<p>Under such a policy it was only a matter of time before the kings</p>
<p>would become the servants of the priests. In the reign of the last

and superstition flourished, and every other element in the national
life decayed. Omens were manipulated to give a divine sanction to every
decision of the clergy. The most vital forces of Egypt were sucked dry
by the thirst of the gods at the very time when foreign invaders were
preparing to sweep down upon all this concentrated wealth.</p>
<p>For meanwhile on every frontier trouble brewed. The prosperity of</p>
<p>the country had come in part from its strategic place on the main
line of Mediterranean trade; its metals and wealth had given it mastery
over Libya on the west, and over Phoenicia, Syria and Palestine on the
north and east. But now at the other end of this trade route — in
Assyria, Babylon and Persia — new nations were growing to maturity and
power, were strengthening themselves with invention and enterprise, and
were daring to compete in commerce and industry with the self-satisfied
and pious Egyptians. The Phoenicians were perfecting the trireme galley,
and with it were gradually wresting from Egypt the control of the sea.
The Dorians and Achaeans had conquered Crete and the Aegean (ca. 1400
b.c.), and were establishing a commercial empire of their own; trade
moved less and less in slow caravans over the difficult and
robber-infested mountains and deserts of the Near East; it moved more
and more, at less expense and with less loss, in ships that passed
through the Black Sea and the Aegean to Troy, Crete and Greece, at last
to Carthage, Italy and Spain. The nations along the northern shores of
the Mediterranean ripened and blossomed, the nations on the southern
shores faded and rotted away. Egypt lost her trade, her gold, her power,
her art, at last even her pride; one by one her rivals crept down upon
her soil, harassed and conquered her, and laid her waste.</p>
<p>In 954 b.c. the Libyans came in from the western hills, and laid
about them with fury; in 722 the Ethiopians entered from the south, and
avenged their ancient slavery; in 674 the Assyrians swept down from the
north and subjected priest-ridden Egypt to tribute. For a time Psamtik,
Prince of Safe, repelled the invaders, and brought Egypt together again
under his leadership. During his long reign, and those of his
successors, came the “Salte Revival” of Egyptian art: the architects and
sculptors, poets and scientists of Egypt gathered up the technical and
esthetic traditions of their schools, and prepared to lay them at the
feet of the Greeks. But in 525 b.c. the Persians under Cambyses crossed
Suez, and again put an end to Egyptian independence. In 332 b.c.
Alexander sallied out of Asia, and</p>

<p>made Egypt a province of Macedon. # In 48 b.c. Caesar arrived to
capture Egypt’s new capital, Alexandria, and to give to Cleopatra the
son and heir whom they vainly hoped to crown as the unifying monarch of
the greatest empires of antiquity. 2 ” In 30 b.c. Egypt became a
province of Ro me, and disappeared from history.</p>
<p>For a time it flourished again when saints peopled the desert, and
Cyril dragged Hypatia to her death in the streets (415 a.d.) ; and again
when the Moslems conquered it (ca. a.d. 650), built Cairo with the ruins
of Mem- phis, and filled it with bright-domed mosques and citadels. But
these were alien cultures not really Egypt’s own, and they too passed
away. Today there is a place called Egypt, but the Egyptian people are
not masters there; long since they have been broken by conquest, and
merged in lan- guage and marriage with their Arab conquerors; their
cities know only the authority of Moslems and Englishmen, and the feet
of weary pilgrims who travel thousands of miles to find that the
Pyramids are merely heaps of stones. Perhaps greatness could grow there
again if Asia should once more become rich, and make Egypt the half- way
house of the planet’s trade. But of the morrow, as Lorenzo sang, there
is no certainty; and today the only certainty is decay. On all sides
gigantic ruins, monuments and tombs, memorials of a savage and titanic
energy; on all sides poverty and desola- tion, and the exhaustion of an
ancient blood. And on all sides the hostile, engulfing sands, blown
about forever by hot winds, and grimly resolved to cover everything in
the end.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the sands have destroyed only the body of ancient Egypt;
its spirit survives in the lore and memory of our race. The improvement
of agriculture, metallurgy, industry and engineering; the apparent
inven- tion of glass and linen, of paper and ink, of the calendar and
the clock, of geometry and the alphabet; the refinement of dress and
ornament, of furni- ture and dwellings, of society and life; the
remarkable development of orderly and peaceful government, of census and
post, of primary and secondary education, even of technical training for
office and administra- tion; the advancement of writing and literature,
of science and medicine; the first clear formulation known to us of

<p>architecture, sculpture and the minor arts to a degree of excellence
and power never (so far as we know) reached before, and seldom equaled
since: these contributions were not lost, even when their finest
exemplars were buried under the desert, or overthrown by some convulsion
of the globe.* Through the Phoenicians, the Syrians and the Jews,
through the Cretans, the Greeks and the Romans, the civilization of
Egypt passed down to become part of the cultural heritage of mankind.
The effect or remembrance of what Egypt accomplished at the very dawn of
history has influence in every nation and every age. “It is even
possible,” as Faure has said, “that Egypt, through the solidarity, the
uni ty, and the disciplined variety of its artistic products, through
the enormous duration and the sus- tained power of its effort, offers
the spectacle of the greatest civilization that has yet appeared on the
earth.”’“ 8 We shall do well to equal it.</p>
