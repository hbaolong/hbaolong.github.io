<h4 id="chapter-xxxiii-the-life-of-the-people">CHAPTER XXXIII The Life
of the People</h4>
<p>i 5 i 7-6 4</p>
<p>I. THE ECONOMY</p>
<p>I N one sense the drama of religious, political, and martial conflict
that filled the front of the sixteenth century was superficial, for it
proceeded only by permission of a deeper drama played behind the
historic scenes or beneath the pompous stage — m an’s daily and
perpetual battle with the soil, the ele - ments, poverty, and death.
What, after all, were the bulls and blasts of popes and Protestants, the
rival absurdities of murderous mythologies, the strut and succession,
gout and syphilis, of emperors and kings, compared with the inexorable
struggle for food, shelter, clothing, health, mates, children, life?</p>
<p>Throughout this period the villages of Europe had to keep watch night
and day against wolves, wild boars, and other threats to their flocks
and homes. The hunting stage survived within the agricultural age: man
had to kill or be killed, and the weapons of defense made possible the
routine of toil. A thousand insects, the beasts of the forests, and the
birds of the air competed with the peasant for the fruit of his seeds
and drudgery; and mysterious diseases decimated his herds. At any time
the rains might become erosive torrents or engulfing floods, or they
might hold back till all life withered; hunger was always around the
comer, and fear of fire was never far from mind. Sickness made frequent
calls; doctors were distant; and in almost every decade plague might
carry off some member of the household precious in the affections of the
family or in the siege of the earth. Of every five children born, two
died in infancy, another before maturity. 1 At least once in each
generation the recruiting officer took a son for the army, and armies
burned villages and ravaged fields. From the crop at last grown and
harvested, a tenth or more went to the landlord, a tenth to the Church.
Life on the land would have been too hard for body or soul had not
happiness in- tervened in the gaiety of children, the games of the
evening home, the release of song, the amnesia of the tavern, and the
half-believed, half-doubted hopes of another and more merciful world. So
the food was produced that fed the barons in the castle, the kings in
their courts, the priests in their pulpits, the merchants and craftsmen
in the towns, the physicians, teachers, artists,</p>
<p>75 J</p>
<p>752 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>poets, scientists, philosophers, and, last and least, the slaves of
the soil them- selves. Civilization is a parasite on the man with the
hoe.</p>
<p>Agricultural science marked time; progress in productivity came
chiefly through the replacement of small holdings by large tracts. The
new land- owning merchants and capitalists brought into stagnant rural
areas a lust for profits that increased both production and misery.
Enterprising importers introduced into Europe a new fertilizer rich in
phosphates and nitrogen — the guano or dung deposited by birds off the
coast of Peru. Plants and shrubs from Asia or America were naturalized
on the soil of Europe; the potato, the magnolia tree, the century plant,
the pepper plant, the dahlia, the nastur- tium…. The tobacco plant was
brought from Mexico to Spain in 1558; a year later Jean Nicot, French
ambassador in Lisbon, sent some seeds of it to Catherine de Medicis;
history rewarded him by giving his name to a poison.</p>
<p>The fishing industry grew as population increased, but the
Reformation dealt a passing blow to the herring trade by allowing meat
on Fridays. Mining progressed rapidly under capitalistic organization.
Newcastle was exporting coal in 1549. The Fuggers multiplied the output
of their mines by prodding labor to greater and more orderly effort, and
by improving the methods of refining ore. Georg Agricola takes us into a
sixteenth-century mine:</p>
<p>The chief kinds of workmen are miners, shovelers, windlass men,</p>
<p>carriers, sorters, washers, and smelters…. The twenty-four hours</p>
<p>of a day and night are divided into three shifts, and each shift
consists of seven hours. The three remaining hours are intermediate
between the shifts, and form an interval during which the workmen enter
and leave the mines. The first shift begins at the fourth hour in the
morn- ing and lasts till the eleventh hour; the second begins at the
twelfth and is finished at the seventh; these two are day shifts in the
morning and afternoon. The third is the night shift, and commences at
the</p>
<p>eighth hour in the evening and finishes at the third in the
morning.</p>
<p>The Bergmeister does not allow this third shift to be imposed
upon</p>
<p>he workmen unless necessity demands it. In that case… they keep their
vigil by the night lamps; and to prevent themselves falling</p>
<p>asleep from the late hours or from fatigue, they lighten their
long</p>
<p>and arduous labors by singing, which is neither wholly untrained nor
unpleasing. In some places one miner is not allowed to undertake two
shifts in succession, because it often happens that he falls asleep in
the mine, overcome by exhaustion from too much labor…. Elsewhere</p>
<p>he is allowed to do so, because he cannot subsist on the pay of
one</p>
<p>shift, especially if provisions grow dearer….</p>
<p>The laborers do not work on Saturdays, but buy those things which</p>
<p>are necessary to life, nor do they usually work on Sundays or annual
festivals, but on these occasions devote the shift to holy things.

<p>THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>ever, the workmen do not rest… if necessity demands their labor;</p>
<p>for sometimes a rush of water compels them to work, sometimes an
impending fall… and at such times it is not considered irreligious</p>
<p>o work on holidays. Moreover, all workmen of this class are
strong</p>
<p>and used to toil from birth. 2</p>
<p>In 1527 Georg Agricola was made city physician of Joachimsthal. In
that mining town he became between times a mineralogist; there and
elsewhere he studied with zeal and fascination the history and
operations of mining and metallurgy; and after twenty years of research
he completed (1550) his De re metallica , which is as epochal a classic
in its field as the masterpieces of Copernicus and Vesalius appearing in
the same decade. He described in accurate detail, and engaged artists to
illustrate, the tools, mechanisms, and processes of mining and smelting.
He was the first to assert that bismuth and antimony are true primary
metals; he distinguished some twenty mineral species not previously
recognized; and he was the first to explain the forma- tion of veins (
canales , channels) of ore in beds of rock by metallic deposits left by
streams of water flowing into and under the earth.* 3</p>
<p>Mining, metallurgy, and textiles received most of the mechanical
improve- ments credited to this age. The earliest railways were those on
which miners pulled or pushed ore-carrying carts. In 1533 Johann Jurgen
added to the spinning wheel, hitherto spun by hand, a treadle that spun
it by foot, leaving the hands of the weaver free; production soon
doubled. Watches were im- proved in reliability while diminishing in
size; they were engraved, chased, enameled, bejeweled; Henry VIII wore a
tiny one that had to be wound only every week. However, the best watches
of this period erred by some fifteen minutes per day. 4</p>
<p>Communication and transport limped behind commerce and industry.
Postal service was gradually extended to private correspondence during
the sixteenth century. The commercial revolution stimulated improvements
in shipbuilding: deeper and thinner keels helped stability and speed;
masts increased from one to three, sails to five or six. 5 Francis I and
Henry VIII ran a race not only in war and love and dress but in
shipping; each had a grandiose vessel built to order and whim, crowded
with superstructure, and flaunting the pennants of their pride. In the
Mediterranean a ship of the early sixteenth century could make ten miles
an hour in fair weather, but the heavier vessels designed for the
Atlantic were lucky to make 125 miles a day. On land the fastest travel
was by the postal courier, who rode some eighty- five miles a day; yet
important news usually took ten or eleven days to get from Venice to
Paris or Madrid. Probably no one then appreciated the com-</p>
<p>Agricola rejected as useless the divining rod or “forked twig” then
often employed to detect metals under the soil. Our Geiger counters
incline us to look with lenience upon these hopeful rods. r</p>
<p>754 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>fort of having news arrive too late for action. Land travel was
mostly on horseback; hence the heavy iron tethering ring fastened to the
entrance door of a house. Coaches were multiplying, but the roads were
too soft for wheeled traffic; coaches had to be equipped with six or
more horses to drag them through the inevitable mud, and they could not
expect to cover more than twenty miles a day. Litters carried by
servants were still used by ladies of means, but simple people traveled
on foot across the continent.</p>
<p>Traveling was popular despite roads and inns. Erasmus thought the
inns of France were tolerable, chiefly because the young waitresses
“giggl e and play wanton tricks,” and, “when you go away, embrace you,”
and “all for so small a price”; but he denounced German innkeepers as
ill -mannered, ill- tempered, dilatory, and dirty.</p>
<p>When you have taken care of your horse you come into the Stove</p>
<p>Room, boots, baggage, mud, and all, for that is a common room for</p>
<p>all comers…. In the Stove Room you pull off your boots, put on</p>
<p>your shoes, and, if you will, change your shirt…. There one combs</p>
<p>his head, another… belches garlic, and… there is as great a confu-
sion of tongues as at the building of the Tower of Babel. In my</p>
<p>opinion nothing is more dangerous than for so many to draw in the</p>
<p>same vapor, especially when their bodies are opened with the heat</p>
<p>… not to mention… the farting, the stinking breaths… and with- out
doubt many have the Spanish, or, as it is called, the French, pox,
though it is common to all nations.®</p>
<p>If matters were really so in some inns, we can forgive a sin or two
to the traveling merchants who put up at and with them in the process of
binding village with village, nation with nation, in an ever spreading
economic web. In each decade some new trade route was opened — overland
as by Chancellor in Russia, overseas by a thousand adventurous voyages.
Shakespeare’s Shy - lock trafficked with England, Lisbon, Tripoli,
Egypt, India, and Mexico. 7 Genoa had trading colonies in the Black Sea,
Armenia, Syria, Palestine, and Spain; it made its peace with the Porte,
and sold arms to the Turks who were at war with Christendom. France saw
the point, made her own ententes with the sultans, and, after 1 560,
dominated Mediterranean trade. Antwerp re- ceived goods everywhence, and
shipped them everywhere.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of this expanding economy the bankers improved
their services and techniques. As the cost of war rose with the change
from feudal levies bringing their own bows and arrows, pikes and swords,
to masses of militia or mercenaries equipped with firearms and artillery
and paid by the state, the governments borrowed unprecedented sums from
the bankers, and the interest they paid or failed to pay made or broke
financial firms. The savings of the people were lent at interest to
bankers, who therewith financed expensive undertakings in commerce and
industry. Notes of exchange re-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 755</p>
<p>placed cumbersome transfers of currency or goods. Rates of interest
varied not with the greed of the lender so much as with the reliability
of the bor- rower; so the free cities of Germany, controlled by
merchants prompt in payments, could borrow at 5 per cent, but Francis I
paid 10, and Charles V</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Rates declined as economies were stabilized.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gold and silver from the mines of Germany, Hungary, Spain, Mexico,
and Peru provided an abundant and fluid currency. The new supplies of
precious metal came just in time, for goods had been multiplying faster
than coin. Imports from Asia were paid for only partly by exports,
partly by gold or silver; hence, in the decades before Columbus, prices
fell, to the discouragement of enterprise and trade. After the
development of European mines, and the import of silver and gold from
Africa and America, the supply of precious metal outran the production
of goods; prices rose, business re- joiced; an economy based on mobile
money dislodged the old economy rooted in the holding of land or the
control of industry by the guilds.</p>
<p>Guilds were in decay. They had taken form in times of municipal au-
tarky and protectionism; they were not organized either to raise capital
or to buy wholesale from distant sources, or to use factory methods and
the division of labor, or to reach distant markets with their products.
From the thirteenth century onward they had developed an aristocratic
exclusiveness, and had made conditions so hard for the journeyman as to
drive him into the arms of the capitalist employer. The capitalist was
animated by the profit motive, but he knew how to gather savings into
capital, how and where to buy machinery and raw materials, run mines,
build factories, recruit work- ers, divide and specialize labor, open
and reach foreign markets, finance elec- tions, and control governments.
The new supplies of gold and silver cried out for profitable investment;
American gold became European capital. In the resultant capital-ism
there was a zest of competition, a stimulus to enter- prise, a feverish
search for more economical ways of production and dis- tribution, which
inevitably left behind the self-contentment of guildsmen plodding in
ancient grooves. The new system surpassed the old in the quan- tity, not
in the quality, of its product; and merchants were crying out for
quantity production to pay with manufactured exports for their imports
from the East.</p>
<p>The new wealth was largely confined to the merchants, financiers,
manu- facturers, and their allies in government. Some nobles still made
fortunes through vast holdings with hundreds of tenants, or through
enclosures that supplied wool to the textile industry; but for the most
part the landowning aristocracy found itself squeezed between kings and
business-controlled cities; it declined in political power, and had to
content itself with pedigrees. The proletariat shared with the nobility
the penalties of inflation. From 1 500 to 1600 the price of wheat, with
which the poor baked their bread, rose</p>
<p>75^ the reformation (chap, xxxiii</p>
<p>150 per cent in England, 200 per cent in France, 300 per cent in
Germany. Eggs had been 4d. for ten dozen in England in 1 300; in 1400
the same quan- tity cost jd., in 1500 7d., in 1570 42d. 8 Wages rose,
but more slowly, since they were regulated by government. In England the
law (1563) fixed the annual wage of a hired farmer at 2.00, of a farm
hand at.50, of a “man servant” at.25; allowing the purchasing power of
these sums to have been twenty-five times greater in 1563 than in 1954,
they come to 80.00 or so per year. We should note, however, that in all
these cases bed and board were added to the wage. By and large the
economic changes of the sixteenth century left the working classes
relatively poorer, and politically weaker, than before. Workers produced
the goods that were exported to pay for imported luxuries that
brightened and softened the lives of a few.</p>
<p>The war of the classes took on a bitterness hardly known since the
days of Spartacus in Rome; let the revolt of the Comuneros in Spain, the
Peasants’ War in Germany, Ket’s Rebellion in England, serve as evidence.
Strikes were numerous, but they were suppressed by a coalition of
employers and government. In 1538 the English Clothworkers’ Guild,
controlled by the masters, decreed that a journeyman who refused to work
under the condi- tions laid down by the employer should be imprisoned
for the first offense, whipped and branded for the second. The laws of
vagrancy under Henry VIII and Edward VI were so savage that few workers
dared to be found unemployed. A law of 1547 enacted that an able-boldied
person leaving his work and roaming the country as a vagrant should be
branded on the breast with a letter V, and be given as a slave for two
years to some citizen of the neighborhood, to be fed on “bread and water
and small drink, and refuse of meat”; and if the vagrancy was repeated
the offender was to be branded on cheek or forehead with the letter S,
and be condemned to slavery for life. 9 It is to the credit of the
English nation that these measures could not be enforced, and had soon
to be repealed, but they display the temper of six- teenth-century
governments. Duke George of Saxony decreed that the wages of miners
under his jurisdiction should not be raised, that no miner should leave
one place to seek work in another, and that no employer should hire
anyone who had fomented discontent in another mine. Child labor was
sanctioned, explicitly or implicitly, by law. The lace-making industry
in Flanders was entirely worked by children, and the law forbade any
girl over twelve years of age to engage in that occupation. 10 Laws
against monopolies, “corners,” or usury were evaded or ignored.</p>
<p>The Reformation fell in with the new economy. The Catholic Church was
by temperament antipathetic to “business”; it had condemned interest,
had given religious sanction to guilds, had sanctified poverty and
castigated wealth, and had freed workers from toil on holydays so
numerous that in 1550 there were in Catholic countries 115 nonworking
days in the year; 11</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIII )</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>his may have played a part in the slower industrialization and
enrichment of Catholic lands. Theologians approved by the Church had
defended the fixing of “just prices” by law for the necessaries of life.
Thomas Aquinas had bra nded as “sinful covetousness” the pursuit of
money beyond one’s needs, and had ruled that any surplus possessions
were “due by natural law to the purpose of succoring the poor.” 12
Luther had shared these views. But the general development of
Protestantism unconsciously co-operated with the capitalist revolution.
Saints’ holydays were abolished, with a resultant increase in labor and
capital. The new religion found support from business- men, and returned
the courtesy. Wealth was honored, thrift was lauded, work was encouraged
as a virtue, interest was accepted as a legitimate reward for risking
one’s savings.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a cruel age, and its laws corresponded to a pitiless economy,
a shameful pauperism, a somber art, and a theology whose God had repu-
diated Christ.</p>
<p>Among populations mostly fated to poverty here and damnation here-
after, crime was natural. Murder was plentiful in all classes. Every man
of caliber dangled a dagger, and only the weakling relied on the law to
redress his wrongs. Crimes of passion were as frequent in life as in
Shakespeare, and any Othello who failed to slay his suspected wife was
rated less than a man. Travelers took highwaymen for granted, and
proceeded in groups. In the cities, still unlit at night, robbers were
as plentiful as prostitutes, and a man’s home had to be his castle. In
the heyday of Francis I a gang of thieves called r nauvcns gargons
despoiled Paris in full sunlight. Brantome tells us, as unre- liably as
usual, how Charles IX, wishing to learn “how the cut -purses per- formed
their arts,” instructed his police to invite ten such artists to a royal
ball; after the ball was over he asked to see their spoils; the money,
jewelry, and garments unostentatiously acquired by them during the
evening amounted to many thousands of dollars’ worth, “at which the King
thought he would die of laughter.” He allowed them to keep the fruit of
their studies, but had them enrolled in the army as better dead than
alive. 13 If we classify as crimes the adulteration of goods, the
chicanery of business frauds, the bribery of courts, the seizure of
ecclesiastical property, the extension of frontiers by conquest, every
second man in Europe was a thief; we may give some the benefit of
clergy, and allow for an honest craftsman here and there. Add a little
arson, a little rape, a little treason, and we begin to under- stand the
problems faced by the forces of order and law.</p>
<p>These were organized to punish, rather than to prevent, crime. In
some large towns, like Paris, soldiers served as guardians of the peace;
city blocks</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>758</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIII</p>
<p>had their wardens, parishes their constables; but by and large the
cities were poorly policed. Statesmen weary of fighting the nature of
man reckoned it cheaper to control crime by decreeing ferocious
penalties, and letting the public witness executions. A score of
offenses were capital: murder, treason, heresy, sacrilege, witchcraft,
robbery, forgery, counterfeiting, smuggling, arson, perjury, adultery,
rape (unless healed by marriage), homosexual ac- tions, “bestiality,”
falsifying weights or measures, adulterating food, damag - ing property
at night, escaping from prison, and failure in attempted suicide.
Execution might be by relatively painless beheading, but this was
usually a privilege of ladies and gentlemen; lesser fry were hanged;
heretics and hus- band-killers were burned; outstanding murderers were
drawn and quar- tered; and a law of Henry VIII (1531) punished poisoners
by boiling them alive, 14 as we gentler souls do with shellfish. A
Salzburg municipal ordinance required that “a forger shall be burned or
boiled to death, a perjurer shall have his tongue torn out by the neck;
a servant who sleeps with his master’s wife, daughter, or sister shall
be beheaded or hanged.” 18 Julienne Rabeau, who had killed her child
after a very painful delivery, was burned at Angers ( 1 5 3 1 ) ; 10 and
there too, if we may believe Bodin, several persons were burned alive
for eating meat on Friday and refusing to repent; those who repented
were merely hanged. 17 Usually the corpse of the hanged was left
suspended as a warning to the living, until the crows had eaten the
flesh away. For minor offenses a man or a woman might be scourged, or
lose a hand, a foot, an ear, a nose, or be blinded in one eye or both,
or be branded with a hot iron. Still milder misdemeanors were punished
by imprisonment in conditions varying from courtesy to filth, or by the
stocks, the pillory, the whipping-cart, or the ducking stool.
Imprisonment for debt was common throughout Europe. All in all, the
penal code of the sixteenth century was more severe than in the Middle
Ages, and reflected the moral disorder of the time.</p>
<p>The people did not resent these ferocious punishments. They took some
pleasure in attending executions, and sometimes lent a helping hand.
When Montecucculi confessed, under torture, that he had poisoned, or had
in- tended to poison, Francis, the beloved and popular son of Francis I,
he was dismembered alive by having his limbs tied to horses which were
then driven in four directions (Lyons, 1536); the populace, we are told,
“cut his remains into little morsels, hacked off his nose, tore out his
eyes, broke his jaws, trained his head in the mud, and ‘made him die a
thousand times before his death.’” 18</p>
<p>To the laws against crime were added “blue laws” against
recreations</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 759</p>
<p>o support the fishing industry and so train men to the sea for the
navy. 19 Gambling was always illegal and always popular. Francis I, who
knew how to amuse himself, ordered the arrest of people who played cards
or dice in taverns or gaming houses (1526), but he allowed the
establishment of a public lottery (1539). Drunkenness was seldom
punished by law, but idle- ness was almost a capital crime. Sumptuary
laws — designed to check con- spicuous expenditure by the newly rich,
and to preserve class distinctions — regulated dress, adornment,
furniture, meals, and hospitality. “When I was a boy,” said Luther, “all
games were forbidden, so that card -makers, pipers, and actors were not
admitted to the sacraments; and those who had played games, or been
present at shows or plays, made it a matter of confession.” 20 Most such
prohibitions survived the Reformation, to reach their peak in the later
sixteenth century.</p>
<p>It was some consolation that enforcement was rarely as severe as the
law. Escape was easy; a kindly, bribed, or intimidated judge or jury let
many a rascal go lightly punished or scot free. (“Scot” originally meant
an assess - ment or fine.) The laws of sanctuary were still recognized
under Henry VIII. However, laxity of enforcement was balanced by
frequent use of torture to elicit confessions or testimony. Here the
laws of Henry VIII, though they were the severest in the history of
England, 21 were ahead of their time; they forbade torture except where
national security was held to be involved. 22 Delay in trying an
indicted person could also be torture; one complaint of the Spanish
Cortes to Charles V was that men charged with even slight offenses
lingered in prison as long as ten years before being tried, and that
trials might drag on for twenty years. 28</p>
<p>Lawyers bred and multiplied as the priesthood declined. They filled
the judiciary and the higher bureaucracy; they represented the middle
classes in the national assemblies and the provincial parlements; even
the aristocracy and the clergy depended on them for guidance in civil
law. A new noblesse de robe — the. “furred cats” of Rabelais— formed in
France. Canon law disap- peared in Protestant countries, and
jurisprudence replaced theology as the piece de resistance in
universities. Roman law sprang back to life in Latin countries, and
captured Germany in the sixteenth century. Local law sur- vived
alongside it in France, “common law” was preferred to it in Eng land,
but the Justinian Code had some influence in shaping and sustaining the
ab- solutism of Henry VIII. Yet in Henry’s own court his chaplain,
Thomas Starkey, composed (c. 1537) a Dialogue whose main theme was that
laws should dictate the will of the king, and that kings should be
subject to elec- tion and recall:</p>
<p>That country cannot long be well governed, nor maintained with</p>
<p>good policy, where all is ruled by the will of one not chosen by</p>
<p>election but cometh to it by natural succession; for seldom seen it
is</p>
<p>760</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>hat they which by succession come to kingdoms and realms are</p>
<p>worthy of such high authority…. What is more repugnant to nature than
a whole nation to be governed by the will of a prince?… What is more
contrary to reason than all the whole people to be ruled by</p>
<p>him which commonly lacketh all reason?… It is not man that can</p>
<p>make a wise prince of him that lacketh wit by nature…. But this
is</p>
<p>in man’s power, to elect and choose him that is both wise and
just,</p>
<p>and make him a prince, and him that is a tyrant so to depose. 24</p>
<p>Starkey died a strangely natural death a year after writing his
Dialogue — but 334 years before it reached print.</p>

<li>MORALS</li>
</ol>
<p>How did the people of Latin Christendom behave? We must not be misled
by their religious professions; these were more often expressions of
pugnacity than of piety. The same sturdy men who could believe so
fiercely could fiercely blaspheme, and the girls who on Sunday bowed
demurely before statues of the Virgin rouged their cheeks hopefully
during the week, and many of them got themselves seduced, if only as a
proposal of marriage. Virginity had to be protected by every device of
custom, morals, law, re- ligion, paternal authority, pedago gy, and
“point of honor”; yet it managed to get lost. Soldiers returning from
campaigns in which sex and liquor had been their chief consolations
found it painful to adjust themselves to con- tinence and sobriety.
Students majored in venery, and protested that forni- cation was but a
venial sin, 26 which enlightened legislators would overlook. Robert
Greene declared that at Cambridge he had “consumed the flower of my
youth amongst wags as lewd as myself.” 26 Female dancers not infre -
quently performe d on the stage and elsewhere “absolutely naked”; 27
this, apparently, is one of the oldest novelties in the world. Artists
looked down their noses at the rules and regulations of sexual behavior,
28 and lords and ladies agreed with the artists. “Among great folk,”
wrote Brantome, “these rules and scruples concerning virginity are made
little of…. How many girls I know, of the Great World, who did not take
their virginity to the marriage bed!” 29 We have noted the sort of story
that sweet Margueri te of Navarre seems to have heard without a blush.
The bookstalls were stacked with licentious literature, for which high
prices were greedily paid. 30 Aretino was as popular in Paris as in
Rome. Rabelais, a priest, did not feel that he would reduce the sales of
his Gargantuan epic by spattering it with such speech as would have made
Aretino run to cover. Artists found a ready market for erotic pictures,
even for pictured perversions; 81 masterpieces of this kind were sold by
street hawkers, letter carriers, strolling players,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 761</p>
<p>even at the great fairs. 82 All the perversions found place in this
period, 88 as in the aristocratic pages of Brantome. 84</p>
<p>Prostitution prospered in income and prestige; it was in this age
that its practitioners came to be called cortigiane — courtesans — which
was the femi- nine of cortigiani — courtiers. Some generals provided
prostitutes for their armies, as a safeguard for the other women of
occupied towns. 85 But as vene- real disease grew almost to the
proportions of a plague, government after government legislated against
the unhappy filles de joie. Luther, while af- firming the naturalness of
sexual desire, labored to reduce prostitution, and under his urging many
cities in Lutheran Germany made it illegal. 86 In 1560 Michel de
l’Hopital, Chancellor of France, renewed the laws of Louis IX against
the evil, and apparently his decree was enforced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the absurd lust of flesh for flesh begot the hunger of soul
for soul, and all the delicate embroidery of courtship and romantic
love. Stolen glances, billets-doux, odes and sonnets, lays and
madrigals, hopeful gifts and secret trysts, poured out of the coursing
blood. A few refined spirits, or playful women, welcomed from Italy and
Castiglione the pastime of Platonic love, by which a lady and her
courtier might be passionate friends but sedulously chaste. Such
restraint, however, was not in the mood of the age; men were frankly
sensual, and women liked them so. Love poetry abounded, but it was a
prelude to possession.</p>
<p>Not to marriage. Parents were still too matter-of-fact to let love
choose mates for life; marriage, in their dispensation, was a wedding of
estates. Erasmus, sensitive to the charms of woman but not of matrimony,
advised youngsters to marry as the oldsters wished, and trust to love to
grow with association 87 rather than wither with satiation; and Rabelais
agreed with him. 88 Notwithstanding these authorities, a rising number
of young people, like Jeanne d’Albret, rebelled against marriages of
realty. Roger Ascham, tutor to Elizabeth, mourned that “our time is so
far from that old discipline and obedience as now not only young
gentlemen but even very girls dare… marry themselves in spite of father,
mother, God, good order, and all.” 89 Luther was alarmed to learn that
Melanchthon’s son had betrothed himself without consulting his father,
and that a young judge in Wittenberg had declared such a betrothal
valid; this, the Reformer thought, was bound to give Wittenberg a bad
name. In the university, he wrote (January 22,1 544) ,</p>
<p>we have a great horde of young men from all countries, and the race
of girls is getting bold, and run after the fellows into their rooms and
chambers and wherever they can, and offer them their free love;</p>
<p>and I hear that many parents have ordered their sons home… say- ing
that we hang wives around their necks…. The next Sunday I</p>
<p>preached a strong sermon, telling men to follow the common road</p>
<p>and manner which had been since the beginning of the world…</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>namely, that parents should give their children to each other
with</p>
<p>prudence and good will, without their own preliminary engagement.</p>
<p>… Such engagements are an invention of the abominable pope,</p>
<p>suggested to him by the Devil to destroy and tear down the power of
parents given and commended to them earnestly by God. 40</p>
<p>Marriage contracts could be arranged for boys and girls as young as
three years, but these marriages could be annulled later, if not
consummated. The legal age for full marriage was generally fourteen for
boys, twelve for girls. Sexual relations after betrothal and before the
wedding were condoned. Even before betrothal, in Sweden and Wales, as
later in some American colonies, “bundling” was allowed: the lovers
would lie together in bed, but were admonished to keep a sheet between
them. 41 In Protestant lands marriage ceased to be a sacrament, and by
1580 civil marriage was competing with marriage by a clergyman. Luther,
Henry VIII, Erasmus, and Pope Clement VII thought bigamy permissible
under certain conditions, espe- cially as a substitute for divorce.
Protestant divines moved slowly toward allowing divorce, but at first
only for adultery. This offense was apparently most prevalent in France,
despite the custom of killing adulterous wives. Illicit love affairs
were part of the normal life of French women of good social standing. 42
A triangular menage like that of Henry II, Catherine de Medicis, and
Diane de Poitiers was quite frequent — the legal wife de con- venance
accepting the situation with wry grace, as sometimes in France
today.</p>
<p>Except in the aristocracies, women were goddesses before marriage and
servants afterward. Wives took motherhood in their stride, gloried in
their numerous children, and managed to manage their managers. They were
robust creatures, accustomed to hard work from sunrise to sunset. They
made most of the clothing for their families, and sometimes took in work
from capitalist entrepreneurs. The loom was an essential part of the
home; in England all unmarried women wer e “spinsters.” The women of the
French court were a different species, encouraged by Francis I to
prettify themselves in flesh and dress, and sometimes turning national
policy by the guided missiles of their charms. A feminist movement was
imported into France from Italy, but rapidly faded as women perceived
that their power and prominence were independent of politics and laws.
Many French women of the upper class were well educated; already, in
Paris and elsewhere, the French salon was taking form as rich and
cultivated ladies made their homes the rendezvous of statesmen, poets,
artists, scholars, prelates, and philos- ophers. Another group of French
women — let Anne of France, Anne of Brittany, Claude, and Renee serve as
instances — stood quietly virtuous amid the erotic storm. In general the
Reformation, being Teutonic, made for the patriarchal view of woman and
the family. It ended her Renaissance en-</p>

<p>hronement as an exemplar of beauty and a civilizer of man. It
condemned the Church’s lenience with sexual diversions, and, after
Luther’s death, it prepared the way for the Puritanic chill.</p>
<p>Social morality declined with the rise of commercialism and the
temporary disruption of charity. The natural dishonesty of man found
fresh forms and opportunities as a money economy displaced the feudal
regime. The newly rich, holding securities rather than land, and seldom
seeing the individuals from whose labor they benefited, had no
traditions of responsibility and generosity such as had gone with landed
wealth. 43 Medieval commerce and industry had accepted moral checks in
the form of guild, municipal, and ecclesiastical regulations; the new
capitalism rejected these restraints, and drew men into a strenuous
competition that pushed aside the old codes. 44 Commercial frauds
replaced pious frauds. The pamphlet literature of the age groaned with
denunciations of wholesale adulteration of food and other products. The
Die t of Innsbruck (1518) complained that importers “add brick dust to
ginger, and mix unhealthy stuff with their pepper.” 45 Luther noted that
merchants “have learned the trick of placing such spices as pepper,
ginger, and saffron in damp vaults to increase their weight. There is
not a single article out of which they cannot make profit through false
measuring, counting, or weighing, or by producing artificial colors….
There is no end to their trickery.” 48 The Venetian Senate branded a
shipment of Eng- lish woolens as fraudulent in weight, make, and size.
47</p>
<p>Charity, in the Latin countries, was still administered with medieval
cheer- fulness. Noble families spent a considerable part of their
incomes in gifts and alms. 48 Lyons inherited from the fifteenth century
a complex organi- zation of municipal charity, to which the citizens
gave “with openhanded generosity.” 40 In Germany and England the hands
were not so open. Luther did his manful best to re-establish the
charities interrupted by the princely confiscation of monastic
properties, but he confessed that his efforts failed. 80 “Under the
papacy,” he mourned, “people were charitable and gave gladly, but now,
under the dispensation of the Gospel, nobody gives any longer; everybody
fleeces everybody else…. Nobody will give a pfennig.” 61 Latimer gave a
similar report in 1548: “London was never so ill as now…. In times past,
when any rich man died… they would bequeath…</p>
<p>great sums towards the relief of t he poor Now charity is waxen
cold.” 02</p>
<p>Two Italian cities. Cardinal Pole told London, gave more alms than
all Eng- land. 88 “As truth spread,” concluded Froude, “charity and
justice languished in England.” 84 Probably it was not Protestantism,
but comm ercialism and unbelief, that diminished charity.</p>
<p>Pauperism grew to the proportions of a social crisis. Evicted
tenants, job- less journeymen, demobilized soldiers, roamed the highways
or littered the</p>
<p>764 THE reformation (chap, xxxiii</p>
<p>slums, begging and robbing to live. In Augsburg the paupers were
reckoned at a sixth of the population, in Hamburg a fifth, in London a
fourth. 55 “O merciful Lord!” cried the reformer Thomas Lever, “what a
number of poor, feeble, halt, blind, lame, sickly… lie and creep in the
miry streets!” 56 Luther, whose heart was as kind as his tongue was
harsh, was among the first to perceive that the state must take over
from the Church the care and rescue of the destitute. In his address To
the Christian Nobility of the German Nation (1520) he proposed that
“every town should provide for its own poor.” During his absence in the
Wartburg his radical followers organized in Wittenberg a community fund
to care for orphans, dower poor girls, give scholarships to needy
students, and lend money to impoverished families. In 1523 Luther drew
up a Regulation of a Common Chest, which urged that in each district the
citizens and clergy should tax themselves to raise a fund from which
loans were to be made, without interest, to persons in need and unable
to work. 57 In 1522 Augsburg appointed six Armenpfleger — Protectors of
the Poor — to supervise the distribution of relief. Nuremberg followed
suit, then Strasbourg and Breslau (1523), Ratisbon and Magdeburg</p>
<p>(1524)-</p>
<p>In that year a Spanish humanist, Juan Luis Vives, wrote for the town
coun- cil of Bruges a tract On the Relief of the Poor. He noted the
spread of pov- erty amid growing wealth, and warned that the extreme
inequality of possession s might engender a ruinous rebellion. “As it is
disgraceful,” he wrote, “for the father of a family in his comfortable
home to permit anyone in it to suffer the disgrace of being unclothed or
in rags, it is similarly unfitting that the magistrates of a city should
tolerate a condition in which citizens are hard pressed by hunger and
distress.” 58 Vives agreed that all who were capable of work should be
made to work, and that no one should be allowed to beg. But since many
were really unable to work, some refuge must be set up for them in
almshouses, hospitals, and schools financed by the municipal- ity; food,
medical care, and elementary education should be given them gratis, and
special provision should be made for the mentally defective. Ypres co
mbined Vives’s ideas with the German precedents and organized (1525) a
community chest which united all charitable endowments in one fund, and
all charitable distribution under one head. Charles V asked for a copy
of the Ypres plan and recommended it to all the cities of the Empire
(1531), and Henry VIII sent a similar directive to the parishes of
England (1536). In Catholic countries the Church retained the
administration of charity.</p>
<p>Political morality remained Machiavellian. Spies were taken for
granted; those of Henry VIII in Rome were expected to report the most
secret con- versations of the Vatican. 59 Bribery was traditional, and
flowed more lushly</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIII ) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 765</p>
<p>after the influx of American gold. Governments competed in violating
trea- ties; Turkish and Christian fleets rivaled each other in piracy.
In the decay of chivalry the morals of war relapsed into semi-barbarism;
cities that had unsuccessfully resisted siege were sacked or burned,
soldiers surrendering were slaughtered or enslaved till ransomed; such
international law and comity as had existed in the occasional submission
of kings to arbitration by popes disappeared in a chaos of nationalistic
expansion and religious enmity. Toward non-Christians, Christians
recognized few moral restraints, and the Turks reciprocated. The
Portuguese captured and enslaved African Ne- groes, and the Spanish
Conquistadores robbed, enslaved, and killed American natives without
abating their high resolve to make the New World Chris- tian. Life was
so bitter for the American Indians under Spanish rule that thousands of
them committed suicide. 60 Even in Christendom there was a startling
increase of suicides in this age. 61 Some humanists condoned self-
destruction, but the Church ruled that it led straight to hell, so that
the successful seeker fell out of the frying pan into the fire.</p>
<p>All in all the Reformation, though it ultimately improved the morals
of Europe, temporarily damaged lay morality. Pirkheimer and Hans Sachs,
both sympathetic with Luther, mourned that a chaos of unregulated
conduct had followed the collapse of ecclesiastical authority. 62
Luther, as usual, was quite frank about the matter:</p>
<p>The more we go forward, the worse the world becomes…. It is</p>
<p>clear enough how much more greedy, cruel, immodest, shameless,</p>
<p>wicked the people are now than they were under popery. 63… We Germans
are today the laughing stock and disgrace of all peoples;</p>
<p>we are regarded as ignominious and obscure swine…. We steal, we lie…
we eat and drink to excess, and we give ourselves to every</p>
<p>vice. 64… It is the general complaint that the young people of today
are utterly dissolute and disorderly, and will not let themselves be</p>
<p>aught any more The women and girls of Wittenberg have begun</p>
<p>o go bare before and behind, and there is no one to punish or correct
them, and God ’s word is mocked. 65</p>
<p>Andreas Musculus, a Lutheran preacher, described his time (1560) as
un- speakably immoral compared with the Germans of the fifteenth
century, 66 and many Protestant leaders agreed with him. 67 “The future
appalls me,” moaned Calv in; “I dare not think of it; unless the Lord
descends from heaven, barbarism will engulf us.” 68 We hear similar
notes from Scotland 69 and England. Froude, ardent defender of Henry
VIII, summed up fairly:</p>
<p>The movement commenced by Henry VIII, judged by its present</p>
<p>results (1550), had brought the country at last into the hands of</p>
<p>mere adventurers. The people had exchanged a superstition which
in</p>
<p>7 66</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>its grossest abuses prescribed some shadow of respect and obedience,
for a superstition which merged obedience in speculative belief; and
under that baneful influence not only the highest virtues of self-</p>
<p>sacrifice, but the commonest duties of probity and morality, were</p>
<p>disappearing. Private life was infected with impurity to which
the</p>
<p>licentiousness of the Catholic clergy appeared like innocence….</p>
<p>Among the good who remained uninfected the best were still to be</p>
<p>found on the Reforming side. 70</p>
<p>We can hardly attribute this moral decline in Germany and England to
Luther’s unchaining of sex or his scorn of “good works,” or to Henry’s
bad example in sexual indulgence and callous cruelty; for a similar — in
some ways a more unrestrained — license ruled in Catholic Italy under
the Renaissance popes, and in Catholic France under Francis I. Probably
the basic cause of the moral loosening in Western Europe was the growth
of wealth. A main supporting cause was the decline of faith not only in
Catholic dogmas but in the very fundamentals of the Christian creed.
“Nobody cares about either heaven or hell,” mourned Andreas Musculus;
“nobody gives a thought to either God or the Devil.” 71 In such
statements by religious leaders we must allow for the exaggeration of
reformers disappointed to find how little their theological emendations
had improved the moral life. Men had not been much better before, and
would not be much better in later centuries, if we may trust the
preachers. We can discover all the sins of the sixteenth century in our
own age, and all of ours in theirs, according to their means.</p>
<p>Meanwhile both Catholicism and Protestantism had set up and strength-
ened two focuses of moral regeneration: the improvement of clerical con-
duct through marriage or continence, and the emphasis on the home as the
final citadel of faith and decency. In the long run the Reformation
would really reform, even to excess; and the time would come when men
and women would look back with secret envy to that sixteenth century
when their ancestors had been so wicked and so free.</p>
<p>rv. MANNERS</p>
<p>People then, as now, were judged more by their manners than by their
morals; the world forgave more readily the sins that were committed with
the least vulgarity and the greatest grace. Here, as in everything but
artillery and theology, Italy led the way. Compared with the Italians
the people north of the Alps, except for a thin upper crust in France
and England, were fairly uncouth; the Italians called them barbarians,
and many Frenchmen, charmed with their Italian conquests in field and
chamber, agreed with them. But the barbarians were eager to be
civilized. French courtiers and courtesans, poets</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 767</p>
<p>and poisoners, followed Italian models; and the English limped
sedulously behind. Castiglione’s Courtier (1528) was translated into
French in 1537, into English in 1561, and polite circles debated the
definition of a gentleman. Manuals of manners were best sellers; Erasmus
composed one. Conversation became an art in France, as later in the
Mermaid Tavern in London; the duel of repartee crossed the Alps from
Italy about the same time as the art of fencing. Conversation was more
polished in France than in Germany; the Germans crushed a man with
humor, the French punctured him with wit. Freedom in speech was the
vital medium of the age.</p>
<p>Since the surface can be more easily made presentable than the soul,
the rising classes in the rising civilizations of the North paid much
attention to their clothing. Commoners dressed artlessly enough — as we
see in Brueghel’s multitudes: cuplike hats, loose blouses with bulging
sleeves, tight trousers reaching down to comfortable shoes, with the
ungainly composition center’ ing upon a codpiece — an insolent bag,
sometimes brightly ornamented, dan- gling before the male crotch.
Moneyed males in Germany enveloped their mighty frames in voluminous
folds of cloth, topped with broad hats that lay on the head like
terraced pancakes; but German women were apparently forbidden to dress
otherwise than as Hautfrmen or cooks. In England, too, the men wore more
finery than their ladies, until Elizabeth outshone them with her
thousand dresses. Henry VIII set a pace in extravagance of costume,
prettifying his pounds with color and ornaments and precious stuffs. The
Duke of Buckingham, at the marriage of Prince Arthur to Catherine of
Aragon, “ware a gowne wrought of needle worke,” says Holinshed, “furred
with sables, and valued at £ 1,500” (50,000? ). 71 Sumptuary laws
forbade any man lower than a knight to ape the sartorial splendor of his
betters. Englishwomen covered their forms tightly, with dresses reaching
from neck to floor, and sleeves to the wrist, with a trimming of fur at
edges, and broad girdles buckled with metal ornaments and carrying a
pendant or a rosary; in general they wore less jewelry than the men.</p>
<p>Under the appreciative Francis I French women opened their bodices,
displayed swelling bosoms, and cut their gowns in the back almost to the
last vertebra. 72 If the natural bust swelled inadequately, an
artificial bust was inserted under the stays. 73 Clothing was tightened
under the breasts and pinched at the waist; sleeves billowed, hidden
wires spread out the skirt at rear and hem, and high-heeled shoes
compelled a prancing, airy step. Women of rank — no others — were
allowed to wear a train, or tail, to their dresses, the nobler the
longer; if nobility sufficed it might be seven yards long, and a maid or
page would follow to hold it up. In another style the woman would cover
her neck with a fraise or ruff, stiffly supported by wires; and men in a
formal mood pilloried themselves in like contraptions. About 1535 Serve-
tus noted that “the women of Spain have a custom that would be held bar

Intro- duction pour les jeunes dames spoke of women “who have no care to

filthy… under their linen”; 76 and a cynical proverb held that
courtesans were</p>
<p>The home almost replaced the church as the center of religious
worship in Protestant lands. The father served as priest, leading the
family in daily prayers, Bible reading, and psalms, and the mother
taught her children the catechism. In the middle classes comfort went
with piety. This was the age when the table evolved by joining trestles
and boards into a sturdy-legged unity, benches and cushions evolved into
the upholstered chair, and the four-poster bed, carved and canopied,
became a symbol of moral stability and financial success. Furniture,
plate, andirons, and kitchen utensils were made to endure, even sparkle,
for generations. Pewter replaced wooden platters; spoons of tin or
silver replaced those of wood.</p>
<p>Houses were big because families were large. Women bore almost an-
nually, often in vain, for infantile mortality was high. John Colet was
the eldest of twenty- two children; by the time he was thirty-two all
the others were dead. Anton Koberger, the Nuremberg printer, had
twenty-five children, and survived twelve of them. Diirer was one of
eighteen children, of whom only three seem to have reached maturity. 78
To round out the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 769</p>
<p>family there were household pets almost as numerous as the progeny.
Parrots had come in from the West Indies, and monkeys from India were
domestic favorites. 79 A whole literature instructed women and children
in the care of dogs and birds.</p>
<p>Meals were enormous. Vegetables were despised, and only slowly won
acceptance; the cabbage, carrot, lettuce, rhubarb, potato, lima bean,
ana strawberry now came into common use. The main meal, or dinner, was
taken at eleven in the morning; supper was deferred till seven — the
higher the class, the later the hour. Beer and wine were the staple
drinks at all meals, even breakfast; one of Thomas More’s claims to fame
was that he drank water. About 1550 the Spaniards brought in chocolate
from Mexico; coffee had not yet percolated from Arabia into Western
Europe. In 1 5 1 2 the house- hold of the Duke of Northumberland allowed
a quart of ale per person per meal, even to boys eight years old; the
average consumption of ale in six- teenth-century Coventry was a quart
per day for every man, woman, and child. 80 The breweries of Munich were
renowned as early as the fourteenth century. 81 Drunkenness was in good
repute in England till “Bloody Mary” frowned upon it; it remained
popular in Germany. The French drank more stably, not being quite so
cold.</p>
<p>Despite poverty and oppression, many of the graces of life continued.
Even the poor had gardens. The tulip, first brought to Western Europe
about 1550 by Busbecq, Imperial ambassador at Constantinople, became a
national passion in Holland. Country houses were a pleasant fashion in
Eng- land and France. Villagers still had their seasonal festivals — May
Day, Har- vest Home, All Saints, Christmas, and many more; kings
themselves went Maying, and crowned themselves with flowers. The
amusements of the rich sometimes provided exciting pageantry for the
poor, as when Henry II entered Lyons in state in 1548; and commoners
might, at a respectful dis- tance, watch lords joust at tournaments —
till that sport went out of style after the death of Diane’s King.
Religious procession s became more pagan as the age of Henry VIII moved
toward the Elizabethan; and on the Continent an easy morality allowed
nude women, in festival pageants, to impersonate his- torical or
mythological characters; Diirer confessed himself fascinated by such a
display at Antwerp in 1 52 1. 82</p>
<p>And there were games. Rabelais filled a chapter by merely listing
them, real and imagined; and Brueghel showed almost a hundred of them in
one painting. Bear-baiting, bullfighting, cockfighting, amused the
populace; foot- ball, bowling, boxing, wrestling, exercised and
exorcized young commoners; and Paris alone had 250 tennis courts for its
blue bloods in the sixteenth century. 83 All classes hunted and gambled;
some ladies threw dice, some bishops played cards for money. 84 Mummers,
acrobats, and players roamed</p>

<p>he countryside, and performed for lords and royalty. Within doors
people played cards, chess, backgammon, and a score of other games.</p>
<p>Of all pastimes the best beloved was the dance. “After dinner,” says
Rabelais, “they all went tag -rag together to the willowy grove, where,
on the green grass, to the sound of merry flutes and pleasant bagpipes,
they danced so gallantly that it was a sweet and heavenly sport to see.”
85 So in England, on May Day, villagers gathered round a gaily decorated
Maypole, danced their lusty rustic measures, and then, it appears,
indulged in intimacies reminiscent of the Roman festival of Flora,
goddess of flowers. Under Henry VIII the May games usually included the
morris (i.e., Moorish) dance, which had come from the Spanish Moors via
the Spanish fandango with castanets. Students danced so boisterously at
Oxford and Cambridge that William of Wykeham had to forbid the ecstasy
near chapel statuary. Luther approved of dancing, and relished
especially the “square dance, with friendly bows, embracings, and hearty
swinging of the partners.” 86 The grave Me - lanchthon danced; and at
Leipzig, in the sixteenth century, the city fathers regularly held a
ball to permit students to become acquainted with the “most honorable
and elegant daughters of magnates, senators, and citizens.” 87 Charles
VI often led ( balait ) the ballet or dance at the French court; Cath-
erine de Medicis brought Italian dancers to France, and there, in the
later days of that unhappy queen mother, dancing developed new
aristocratic forms. “Dancing,” said Jean Tabourot, in one of the oldest
books on on e of the oldest arts, “is practiced in order to see whether
lovers are healthy and suitable for one another; at the end of a dance
the gentleman is permitted to kiss his mistress, in order that he may
ascertain if she has agreeable breath. In this manner… dancing becomes
necessary for the good government of society.” 88 It was through its
accompaniment of the dance that music de - veloped from its vocal and
choral forms into the instrumental compositions that have made it the
dominating art of our time.</p>
