<p>Medicine</p>
<p>1715-89</p>
<p>I. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</p>
<p>A ND there was the impact of science upon medicine. The healing art
was bound up with the improvement of the microscope and the ther-
mometer, with the rise of chemistry and biology, and, above all, with
the advancing knowledge of human and animal anatomy and physiology. Most
of the researches in anatomy and physiology were the work of the doctors
themselves.</p>
<p>Giovanni Battista Morgagni was typical of the many physicians who</p>
<p>made medicine a science by keeping clinical records of the cases that
came under their care. Seven hundred such cases were scrutinized by him
in his devoted career as practitioner and professor of medicine at
Padua. In his eightieth year (1761) he reported his observations in the
form of sev- enty letters that founded pathological anatomy: De sedibus
et causis mor- borum per anatomen indagatis ( On the Seats and Causes of
Diseases as Investigated by Anatomy ). Here he gave classical
descriptions of heart block, yellow atrophy of the liver, and
tuberculosis of the kidney; he iden- tified the clinical features of
pneumonia with solidifications of the lungs; and he added significantly
to cardiology. “The sect ion on aneurysm 〔ab- normal blood- filled
dilation〕 of the aorta,” said Sir William Osier, “re - mains one of the
best ever written”; and “what could be more correct than his account of
angina pectoris?” 1 Now, more clearly than ever before, the seat of each
illness was localized in morbid alterations of specific organs.
Impressed by Morgagni’s work, the hospitals— with no protest from Church
or state — provided him and his assistants with cadavers from all
classes of the community, even nobles and ecclesiastics; many
individuals, in the wish to advance science, expressed a desire to have
their bodies examined by Morgagni after their death. 2 He made
experiments on animals, again without protest from the Church. He
continued to teach till his ninetieth year. In 1764, aged eighty- two,
he was reported to be “as hale as a man of fifty, and still working
without spectacles.” 3 His students proudly pro - claimed him u
anatomicorum totius Europae princeps .” In 1931 his native Forli raised
a monument to him in the piazza that bears his name.</p>
<p>586</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>His pupil Antonio Scarpa became professor of anatomy at Modena at the
age of twenty. When, aged thirty-six (1783), he was promoted to the
chair of anatomy at Pavia, he joined Spallanzani and Volta in making
that university one of the greatest in Europe. His anatomical studies of
the ear, the nose, the feet, and the nerves won him international
renown; his Osservazioni sulle principali malattie degli occhi (1801)
continued for sev- eral decades to be the standard text of
ophthalmology. Just a year younger than Scarpa, Felix Vicq- d’Azyr
studied the comparative anatomy of birds, quadrupeds, and man; his
results showed a remarkable and detailed similar- ity in the structure
of the limbs in’men and beasts, and shared in putting man in his
biological place. He died at forty-six (1794), without having completed
a work which had already brought the anatomy of the brain to its
eighteenth-century peak.</p>
<p>In Great Britain two Hunters, born in Scotland, added brilliance to
the Scottish Enlightenment by their work in anatomy and surgery.
William’s lectures revolutionized the teaching of anatomy in London,
where that sub- ject had long been hampered by restriction on the
availability of cadavers. He won fame by his epochal discovery (1758) of
the absorbent function of the lymphatics, by his classic Anatomy of the
Gravid Uterus (1774), and by his volcanic temper, which he explained on
the ground that, being an anatomist, he was accustomed to “the passive
submission of dead bodies.” 4 He died in 1783, aged sixty -five, from
exhaustion incurred in a lecture. He bequeathed his extensive anatomical
collection to Glasgow, where it is still maintained as the Hunterian
Museum.</p>
<p>John Hunter was born ten years after his brother, and died ten years
after his brother’s death. At twenty -one (1749) he had acquired
sufficient knowledge to take charge of William’s class in practical
anatomy. While with his brother, he solved the problem of the descent of
the testes in the foetus, traced the placental circulation and the
ramifications of nasal and olfactory nerves, discovered the tear ducts,
and took a leading part in ex- posing the functions of the lymphatic
ducts. At twenty-seven he entered Oxford; however, finding Latin and
Greek deader than cadavers, he left college and joined the army as a
surgeon. In active service abroad he learned much about gunshot wounds;
at his death he left a classic treatise on that subject. Back in
England, he practiced and taught surgery, and continued his
investigations of anatomy and physiology. In 1767 he met with an
accident that ruptured his “tendon of Achilles” (which binds the muscles
of the calf of the leg to the heel); from observations then made on
himself, and from experiments on dogs, he found successful surgery for
club feet and other deformities involving tendons. Having inadvertently
inoculated himself with syphilis, he delayed its treatment in order to
study the disease at first hand; 5 however, he made the mistake of
identifying</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>syphilis with gonorrhea. He proved by experiment that digestion does
not take place in snakes and lizards during hibernation. In his house at
Bromp- ton he gathered for his researches a weird menagerie of
pheasants, par- tridges, toads, fish, geese, hedgehogs, silkworms, bees,
hornets, wasps, an eagle, two leopards, and a bull. He nearly lost his
life wrestling with the bull and recapturing escaped leopards. He
anatomized over five hundred species of animals. He studied the effects
of various toxins, and admitted in 1780 that he had “poisoned some
thousands of animals.”</p>
<p>In 1785 he sat for his portrait to Reynolds, but at first proved too
rest- less; Sir Joshua was about to abandon the sitting, when Hunter
fell into a deep and motionless reverie which enabled the artist to make
the sketch for the portrait now in the Royal College of Surgeons. Like
his brother, John was of an irritable and imperious temper. Finding
himself subject to angina pectoris, he said, “My life is in the hands of
any rascal who chooses to annoy and tease me.” 6 Contradicted by one of
his colleag ues, he fell into a rage, and died within a few minutes
(1793). He was buried in West- minster Abbey, next to the remains of Ben
Jonson. His collection of</p>
<p>thirteen thousand specimens was acquired by the Corporation of
Surgeons through a governmental grant, and became in 1836 the Hunterian
Museum of London. The “Hunterian oration” delivered in his memory is an
annual event in the English medical world.</p>
<p>In physiology the great name of this period was Albrecht von Haller.
We have met him as a poet in his youth; in his later years he placed
him- self at the head of his kind by his Elementa physiologiae Corporis
humani, which appeared in eight volumes between 1757 and 1766. They not
only recorded all the current lore of human anatomy and physiology, but
in- cluded his own discoveries on the role of the bile in the digestion
of fats, and on the irritability or contractility of muscle fibers
independently of nerves and even when separated from the body. Diderot
concluded from these and similar experiments, “If life remains in organs
severed from the body, where is the soul? What happens to its unity? …
to its indivisi- bility?” 7 He argued from such evidence that all
physiological processes are mechanical. Haller disagreed; the
irritability of organic tissue, he felt, indicated a vital principle
absent in inorganic substances and incompatible with a mechanistic
philosophy. Further studies by Haller showed that “the structure of the
bones of quadrupeds is essentially the same as that of birds,” and that
“the bones in man are not different in any part of their structure from
those of quadrupeds.” 8 In 1755 he made the first recorded observa -
tion of atherosclerosis, the accumulation of mushy fat in the walls of
the bloo d vessels. “When we open the pages of Haller,” said Sir
William</p>
<p>Foster, “we feel that we have passed into modern times.” 9</p>
<p>Other investigations lent support to a mechanistic view. Robert
Whytt</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>589</p>
<p>showed (1751) that reflex actions need involve only a small segment
of the spinal cord. The work of Priestley, Lavoisier, Laplace, and
Lagrange seemed to reduce respiration to chemical processes analogous to
combus- tion. Reaumur’s experiments (1752) pr oved that digestion
results from the chemical action of gastric juices; Spallanzani showed
(1782) that this action of the digestive juices upon food could go on
even outside the stomach; and John Hunter discovered that after death
these juices begin to digest the stomach wall itself.</p>
<p>Spallanzani was one of the major figures in eighteenth-century
physiol- ogy. We have seen his experiments on “spontaneous” generation.
His inter - est in digestion knew no bounds. He discovered the digestive
function of saliva. He experimented on himself by stimulated vomiting,
and by swal- lowing bags and tubes, which he patiently recovered from
his stools. He was the first to show that the systolic contraction of
the heart sends blood into the smallest capillaries. He showed that
perspiration is not akin to respiration, but can, up to a certain point,
take the place of breathing. Though an abbot, he became an authority on
fertilization. He found that when the male organs of a frog were covered
with waxed linen the fe- male remained unfertilized after mating; but
when he collected the male fluid from the linen, and placed it in
contact with the female eggs, these became fertilized. He obtained
artificial fertilization in mammals by in- jecting the sperm of a dog
into the uterus of a bitch. 10 The twentieth cen- tury finally
appreciated the scope and significance of his indefatigable ex-
periments, and recognized him as one of the elect in the priesthood of
science.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE INGENUITY OF DISEASE</li>
</ol>
<p>Did the growth of knowledge defeat the resourcefulness of disease?
Hardly. Voltaire estimated the average longevity of human life in his
time at twenty- two years.” The slums of the growing cities made for a
high rate of infantile mortality, sometimes reaching fifty per cent. 12
In London fifty-eight per cent of all children died before their fifth
birthday. 13 The abandonment of infants was widely practiced. In the
eight years 1771-77 nearly 32,000 children were admitted to the Paris
Foundling Hospital — eighty-nine per day; of these babies 25,476 (eighty
per cent) died before completing their first year. A contribution to
infant mortality was made in the eighteenth century by the spread of
dry-nursing — the replacement of the breast of mother or wet nurse by
the bottle. Sir Hans Sloane</p>
<p>reckoned the death rate of bottle-fed infants as three times that of
the breast-fed. The new method became especially popular in the upper
classes of France, until Rousseau’s Emile (1762) made breast feeding
fashion able.</p>
<p>590</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Abortion and contraception continued. The linen sheath, recommended
by Fallopio in 1564 to prevent venereal infection, was used in the
eight- eenth century to prevent conception. 14 Dr. Jean Astruc, in De
Morbis venereis (1736), mentioned debauchees who “have been employing
for some time sacs made of fine, seamless membrane in the form of a
sheath, . . . called in English ‘condum.’” 15 A Mrs . Phillips in 1776
issued handbills in London announcing that her shop had a full supply of
such “implements of safety, which secure the health of her customers.”
16 Despite these “ma - chines,” as they were called, venereal disease
took its toll in ever y class. Lord Chesterfield warned his son to be
careful, for though “in love a man may lose his heart with dignity, … if
he loses his nose he loses his char- acter into the bargain.” 17</p>
<p>We who live after Jenner can hardly imagine what a curse smallpox</p>
<p>was before he converted the Western world to vaccination. Voltaire
cal- culated that “in a hundred persons that come into the world, at
least sixty contract smallpox; of these sixty, twenty die . . . and
twenty more keep very disagreeable marks of t his cruel disorder as long
as they live.” 18 Be - tween 1712 and 1715 three heirs to the French
throne died of smallpox. The Prince de Ligne thought that 200,000
inmates of nunneries and monas- teries had sought refuge there from the
humiliation of smallpox disfigure- ment. 19 The disease reached epidemic
proportions in Paris in 1719, in Sweden in 1749-65, in Vienna in 1763
and 1767, in Tuscany in 1764, in London in 1766 and 1770.</p>
<p>Epidemics in general were now less severe than in earlier centuries,
but they remained among the hazards of life. They were more formidable
in the countryside than in the cities, despite urban slums, for the
peasants could seldom afford medical care. Epidemics of typhus, typhoid
fever, and smallpox killed eighty thousand persons in Brittany in the
one year 1741. 20 In 1709 bubonic plague carried off 300,000 persons in
Prussia; it reap- peared with less intensity in the Ukraine in 1737, in
Messina in 1743, in Moscow in 1789. Scarlet fever, malaria ( mal aria,
bad air), dysentery, were common, especially in the lower classes, where
they were favored by poverty of public sanitation and personal hygiene.
Epidemics of con- tagious puerperal fever occurred in Paris, Dublin,
Aberdeen, Thurgau, and Bern. Influenza, which the French called la
grippe (adhesion), reached the epidemic stage at various times in Italy,
Sweden, and Germany. Oc- casionally it led to infantile poliomyelitis,
as in the boy who became Sir Walter Scott. Pneumonia, diphtheria, and
erysipelas now and then neared epidemic proportions. Whooping cough,
which seems so minor now, was widespread and dangerous, especially in
northern Europe; in Sweden forty thousand children died of it between
1749 and 1764. Yellow fever came in from America, and rose to epidemic
form at Lisbon in 1723. To these</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>and a hundred other ailments the ladies of the upper classes added
“the vapors”— a confused mixture of nervous exhaustion, hypochondria,
in- somnia, and boredom, rising at times to hysteria.</p>
<p>Against such public enemies the governments provided some measures of
sanitation. But offal was still for the most part emptied into the
streets. Water closets appeared in Paris at the beginning of the
century, but only in a few houses; they were almost entirely lacking
elsewhere on the Con- tinent. Bathrooms were a luxury of the rich.
Public baths were probably less numerous than in the Renaissance.
Hygiene made more progress in armies and navies than in cities. Sir John
Pringle advanced military medi- cine (1774), and James Lind of Scotland
revolutionized naval hygiene (1757). In Anson’s expedition of 1740 some
seventy -five per cent of the crews were at times disabled by scurvy. In
an epochal treatise on that disease (1754) Lind pointed out that orange
or lemon juice had been used in treating it by the Dutch in 1565 and by
Sir Richard Hawkins in 1593; through Lind’s influence this preventive
was introduced in the British navy (1757). In Cook’s second voyage,
lasting over three years (1772-75), only one case of scurvy proved
fatal. In 1795 the use of citrus juices or fruits was made obligatory in
the British navy (hence the name “limey” for a British sailor or
soldier); thereafter naval scurvy disappeared.</p>
<p>It was a milestone in eighteenth-century humanitarianism when Victor
Riqueti, Marquis de Mirabeau, laid down the principle (1756) that the
health of the people is a responsibility of the state. Johann Peter
Frank, who began life as a poor child abandoned at a street door,
proposed a com- plete system of public medical service in his System
einer vollstdndigen medizinischen Polizei (1777- 78). These four
volumes, the “noble monu - ment of a lifelong devotion to humanity,” 21
described the measures that</p>
<p>Hospitals lagged far behind the need for institutional care of
disease. Their number grew, but their quality declined. England in
particular</p>
<p>multiplied its hospitals in the eighteenth century, but all of them
were maintained by private contributions, none by state endowment. 22 In
Paris the leading hospital, the Hotel-Dieu, received 251,178 patients in
the eleven years from 1737 to 1748; of these, 61,091 died. The demands
on this “Mansion of God” led to its putting three, four, five, even six
persons in the same bed; “the dying and those on the road to recovery
lay next</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>to each other; . . . the air was tainted with the emanations from so
many diseased bodies.” 23 It was one of the many beneficent acts of
Louis XVI that in 1781 he decreed that “henceforward 2,500 patients
should have a separate bed, that five hundred should sleep in double
beds divided with a partition,” and that there should be special rooms
for the convalescent. 24 Nevertheless, seven years later the hospital
had single beds for only 486 patients; 1,220 beds held four or more
patients, and eight hundred patients lay on straw. 25 In
Frankfurt-am-Main and other cities the air in the hos- pitals was so
fetid that “physicians declined hospital service as equivalent to a
sentence of death.” 26</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>TREATMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>A few doctors dared to undermine their income by spreading a knowl-
ledge of preventive medicine. Dr. John Arbuthnot of London, in an Essay
concerning the Nature of Ailments (1731), argued that diet would do
almost all that medicine could accomplish. He anticipated later
complaints in’ a treatise, The Cost of Preserving Health (1744). The
instruction of medical students improved slowly, with the Italian
universities (Padua, Bologna, Pavia, Rome) still in the lead, and with
Vienna, Paris, and Mont- pellier following; but even in these there were
only four or five professors. Each teacher collected fees for his own
course, and issued tickets of ad- mission, sometimes on the back of
playing cards. 27 Certain hospitals now began to teach clinical
medicine. Legal practice of medicine, or of mid- wifery, required a
diploma from an accredited institution.</p>
<p>Just as Georg Stahl’s theory of fire as “phlogiston” dominated
chemistry in the century before Lavoisier, so his concept of “animism”
dominated medicine. Rejecting Descartes’ view of the body as a
mechanism, Stahl pictured the soul as an immaterial principle of life
molding the body as its instrument. Consequently (he held) nature, in
the form of this life force, is the chief agent in curing disease;
sickness is an effort of the anima to re-establish the normal tone,
operation, and harmony of disordered or- gans; heightened temperature
and quickened pulse are means that nature uses to overcome disease; a
wise doctor will rely chiefly on such processes of auto-detoxication,
and will be reluctant to administer drugs. Stahl left unanswered the
question of the cause that produced the disorder. One answer was given
by Marcus Antonius Plenciz, who in 1762 revived</p>
<p>Athanasius Kircher’s conception of disease as due to infection by a
micro - organism; for each disease, said Plenciz, there is a particular
invading or- ganism, with a definite period of incubation. This
remarkable prevision of the germ theory left no mark on
eighteenth-century therapy, and had to be revived a second time in the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>593</p>
<p>Some new methods of diagnosis were advanced. Stephen Hales advo-
cated the measurement of blood pressure; Leopold Auenbrugger intro-
duced percussion of the chest as a way of detecting fluid in the thorax.
Two Scots, George Martine and James Currie, developed the use of the
clinical thermometer.</p>
<p>Drugs, surgery, and quackery competed for the money of the patient.
Bloodletting was still the standard panacea; one physician calculated in
1754 that forty thousand deaths were caused each year in France by ex-
cessive withdrawal of blood. 28 Toward the end of the century protests
mounted, and found an effective voice in Wolstein’s Annotations regard -
ing Venesection (1791). Drugs multiplied. The official London Pharma-
copoeia of 1746 discarded prescriptions made of spider webs, unicorn
horns, and virgin’s milk, but it retained theriac, crab’s eyes, wood
lice, vipers, and pearls as forming curative mixtures. The Pharmacopoeia
of 1721 gave official standing to paregoric (containing opium), ipecac,
tartar emetic, spirit of sal volatile, and other new drugs; the edition
of 1746 added valerian, sweet spirits of niter, and “balsam” (tincture
of benzoin); the edition of 1788 sanctioned arnica, sarsaparilla,
cascarilla, magnesia, tincture of opium . . . Castor oil came into use
in modern Europe about 1764, arsenic toward 1786; colchicum was
introduced for gout in 1763. William Withering, a Shropshire lad,
learned from an old granddame that foxglove (digitalis) is good for
dropsy; he earned a niche in medical history by discovering its
usefulness in ailments of the heart (1783). Many reputable physicians
made and sold their own drugs, and charged rather for their
prescriptions than for their visits. “Proprietary medicines”— from
secret and patented formulas — made some individuals rich. So England
absorbed tons of “Stoughton’s Elixir,” “Betton’s British Oils,”
“Hooper’s Female Pills,” and Ching’s “Worm Lozenges.”</p>
<p>Quacks were an appealing element in the medical scene. “Count” Ales -

<p>The most famous quack of the eighteenth century was Franz Anton</p>
<p>Mesmer. The thesis that earned him a doctor’s degree at Vienna (1766)
renewed the old claim of astrological influences on man; these he
explained by magnetic waves. For a time he tried to cure diseases by
stroking the</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>affected parts with magnets; later, having met a priest who seemed to
cure merely by laying on of hands, he discarded magnets, but announced
that an occult force dwelt within him, which could be transmitted to
others under financial stimulation. He opened an office in Vienna, where
he treated patients by touching them — as kings had done for scrofula,
and as faith healers do today. The police declared him a charlatan, and
ordered him to leave Vienna within forty-eight hours. He moved to Paris
(1778), and began afresh by publishing a Memoir e sur la decouverte du
magnetisme animal (1779). Patients came to him to be “mesmerized”; he
touched them with a wand, or stared into their eyes until he produced a
semihypnotic submission to his suggestions; in this hypnotizing process
his ugliness was a terrifying asset. He set up magnetic tubs ( baquets )
containing a mixture based on hydrogen sulfide, and provided with iron
projections which the patients touched as they joined hands with one
another; to make the cure more certain Mesmer himself touched each in
turn. His patients included the Marquis de Lafayette, the Duchesse de
Bourbon, the Princesse de Lam- balle, and other persons prominent at
court. Louis XVI offered him ten thousand francs if he would reveal his
secret and establish a Magnetic In- stitute open to all; he refused.
Within six months he took in 350,000 francs. 29 In 1784 the Academie des
Sciences appointed a committee, in- cluding Lavoisier and Franklin, to
investigate Mesmer’s method s. Its re- port admitted some of his claims
and cures (especially of minor nervous ailments), but rejected his
theory of animal magnetism. The French Revo- lutionary government
denounced him as an impostor, confiscated his tempting fortune, and
banished him from France. He died in Switzerland in 1815.</p>
<p>In London James Graham opened (1780) a “Temple of Health” on</p>
<p>Mesmer’s principles, but with improvements. He provided a magical wed
- ding bed for married couples, which was guaranteed to ensure beautiful
offspring; he rented it at a hundred pounds per night. 30 His assistant
as “Goddess of Health” in his procedures was Emma Lyon, destined, as
Lady Hamilton, to hypnotize Lord Nelson himself.</p>
<p>Confused by the proliferation of quacks and their miraculous cures,
both the public and the medical profession took nearly all of the
eighteenth century to accept prophylactic inoculation as a legitimate
form of therapy. The transfer of weakened virus from a smallpox-infected
human being to another person to make him immune to smallpox had been
practiced by the ancient Chinese. 31 For the same purpose Circassian
women pricked the body with needles touched with smallpox fluids. In
1714 a communication from Dr. Emanuel Timoni, read before the Royal
Society of London,</p>
<p>described “the procuring of the smallpox by incision or inoculation,
as it has for a long time been practiced in Constantinople.” 32 In a
letter sent</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII)</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>595</p>
<p>from Constantinople on April i, 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>The smallpox, so fatal and so general amongst us 〔British〕, is
here</p>
<ul>
<li>made〕 entirely harmless by the invention of ingrafting. . . .
Every</li>
</ul>
<p>year thousands undergo this operation . . . There is no example
of</p>
<p>anyone that has died of it. You may believe that I am very well
satis- fied of the safety of the experiment, since I intend to try it on
my dear little son. 33</p>
<p>The boy, six years old, was inoculated in March, 1718, by Dr. Charles
Maitland, an English physician then in Turkey.</p>
<p>In 1721 a smallpox epidemic spread through London, proving especially
fatal to children. Lady Mary, who had returned from Turkey, commis-
sioned Dr. Maitland, also repatriated, to inoculate her four-year-old
daugh- ter. Three prominent doctors were invited to see how little the
future Lady Bute was disturbed by the results. They were impressed, and
one of them had his son inoculated. Lady Mary propagated the idea at
court. Princess Caroline agreed to have it tested on six criminals who
had been condemned to be hanged; they submitted on a promise of freedom
if they survived; one suffered a mild attack of the disease; the others
showed no ill effects; all six were released. In 1722 the Princess had
the operation per- formed on the orphan children of St. James’s Parish,
with complete success; in April she had it performed on two of her
daughters. Acceptance of inoculation spread among the British
aristocracy, but the death of two inoculated persons in their households
arrested the movement and gave a hold to the opposition. One critic
complained that “an experiment prac - ticed only by a few Ignorant Women
. . . should on a sudden, and upon slender Experience, so far obtain in
one of the Politest Nations in the World as to be received into the
Royal Palace.” 34 Lady Mary felt the stab, and published an anonymous
“Plain Account of the Inoculating of the Small Pox by a Turkey
Merchant.” Most English physicians rejected</p>
<p>inoculation as unsafe, but in 1760 Robert and Daniel Sutton
introduced inoculation by puncture, and reported that in 30,000 cases
they had had 1,200 fatalities — four per cent. As late as 1772 Edward
Massey, an English clerg yman, preached against “the dangerous and
sinful practice of inocula - tion,” and stood stoutly by the old
theological view that diseases are sent by Providence for the punishment
of sin. 35 (Perhaps, like many old re- ligious doctrines, this could be
profanely rephrased: disease is often a punishment for ignorance or
negligence.)</p>
<p>Other countries took up the idea. In America Dr. Zabdiel
Boylston,</p>
<p>during the sixth epidemic of smallpox in Boston, inoculated his son
(1721), and performed 246 additional inoculations despite an excited
opposition</p>
<p>596</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>that threatened to hang him. Most of the Puritan clergy defended him
and shared the obloquy brought upon him. 36 Benjamin Franklin and
Benjamin Rush gave their influential support to the inoculation movement
in Phil- adelphia. In France the Regent Philippe d’Orleans, with his
usual courage, led the way by having his two children inoculated. The
Faculty of Medi- cine at the University of Paris opposed the practice
till 1763. Voltaire, in his Lettres sur les Anglais, praised Lady Mary’s
campaign, noted the uni - versality of the practice among the
Circassians, and ascribed it to the mone- tary value of beauty: “The
Circassians are poor, but have handsome daugh- ters, who accordingly are
the principal article of their foreign trade. It is they who furnish
beauties for the seraglios of the Grand Seigneur and the sufi of Persia,
and others who are rich enough to purchase and maintain these preci ous
commodities.” 37 An Italian physician, Angelo Gatti, spread the
inoculation experiment in France, and Theodore Tronchin in Switzer-
land. Catherine the Great and Grand Duke Paul of Russia had themselves
inoculated on the urging of Voltaire (1768); and in that year Jan Ingen-
housz inoculated three of the imperial family in Vienna.</p>
<p>All these experiments, using smallpox serum from a human being, left
much dissatisfaction, for the rate of mortality from inoculation, though
down to four per cent, was still disagreeably high. An English surgeon,
Edward Jenner, noticed that dairymaids who had contracted cowpox (a
relatively mild disease) rarely contracted the often fatal smallpox.
About 1778 he conceived the idea of conferring immunity to smallpox by
inocu- lating with a vaccine made from a pox-infected cow (vacca is
Latin for cow), This had already been done by a Dorset farmer, Benjamin
Jesty, in 1774-89, without attracting the attention of the medical
world. In May, 1796, Jenner performed vaccination by inoculating James
Phipps with cowpox pus. In July he inoculated the same boy with smallpox
virus. The boy did not develop smallpox. Jenner concluded that cowpox
vaccine gave immunity to smallpox. In 1798 he published his epochal
Inquiry into the Cause and Effects of the Variolae V accinae ( variola
was the medical name for smallpox), reporting his twenty-three cases,
all successful. Subsequent experiments were so convincing that in 1802
and 1807 Parliament granted Jenner thirty thousand pounds to extend his
work and improve his pro- cedure. Smallpox, which for centuries had been
one of the major scourges of human life, thereafter rapidly diminished
its incidence, until today its occurrence in Europe and America is
almost always due to the infection of unvaccinated persons by the
importation of the virus from countries where inoculation is not
practiced.</p>

<p>The medical art was becoming so complex with increasing medical</p>
<p>science that it budded specialties. Gynecology was not yet a separate
devo- tion, but obstetrics was now a distinct skill, and passed more and
more into male hands. Feminine modesty still preferred trained midwives
where these were available, but several royal mothers in childbirth set
the example of accepting the ministrations of men. William Smellie led
the way in England with his studies in the mechanism of labor and the
use of the forceps- studies brought together, after thirty years of
experience, in his classic — Midwifery (1752).</p>
<p>Ophthalmology made a significant advance with operations for cataract
by William Cheselden (1728) and Jacques Daviel; the latter originated
(1752) the modern treatment of cataract by extraction of the lens. In
1760 the first bifocal spectacles were made, for Benjamin Franklin and
appar- ently at his suggestion. We shall find Diderot studying the
psychology of blind persons, and suggesting that they might be taught to
read by touch; perhaps in collusion with him Rousseau (it is said)
proposed embossed printing for the blind. 38</p>
<p>Otology progressed through the use of the catheter for cleansing the
Eustachian tube (1724), through the first successful operation for
mastoid (1736), and through the discovery of an elastic fluid in the
labyrinth of the ear (1742). Giacomo Rodriguez Pereira of Spain, having
fallen in love with a deaf-and-dumb girl, devoted himself to developing
a sign language using on ly one hand; the Abbe Charles Michel de l’fipee
improved silent chatter</p>
<p>The treatment of the insane became more humane with the decline of
the old theological view — held by Bossuet and Wesley — that insanity
was a diabolical possession allowed by God as a punishment for guilt
inherited or acquired. In the Narrenthurm (Fools’ Tower) at Vienna the
inmates were on view to paying sightseers like animals in a menagerie.
The Bethle- hem (“Bedlam”) Hospital for Lunatics was one of the
showplaces of</p>
<p>London, where, for a fee, the public might gaze upon madcaps tied by
chain and iron collar to the wall. In the Hotel-Dieu at Paris the insane
were treated with cruelty or negligence by underpaid and overworked
attend- ants. Still worse were private asylums, which could be persuaded
to accept for incarceration sane persons delivered to them by hostile
relatives. 39 Various drugs or devices were used to cure or quiet the
victims — opium, camphor, belladonna, bleedings, enemas, or a mustard
plaster on the head. Some specialists thought that a sudden douche of
cold water could miti-</p>
<p>598</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>gate melancholia; others recommended marriage as a cure for insanity.
The first modern move toward a saner treatment of insanity was made by
the Quakers of Pennsylvania, who established asylums where the condition
was treated as a disease. In 1774 Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany</p>
<p>founded in Florence the Ospedale Bonifazio, where, under the
direction of Vincenzo Chiarugi, a scientific approach to the problem was
inaugu- rated. In 1788 the French government appointed a commission to
reform the care of the insane. The chairman, Philippe Pinel, had begun
as a divinity student, had changed to philosophy, and had imbibed the
humanitarian ethics of Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau. In 1791 he
published his Traite medico-philosophique sur F alienation mentale, a
milestone in modern medicine. In 1792 he was made medical director of
the Bicetre, one of the largest asylums in France; two years later he
was advanced to the still larger Salpetriere. After many appeals to the
Revolutionary government he received permission to strike off the chains
from his patients, to release them from their cells, and to give them
fresh air, sunlight, exercise, and progressive mental tasks. This was
one of many triumphs of secular humani- tarianism in the most agnostic
of centuries.</p>
<p>V. SURGERY</p>
<p>Next to the development of inoculation into vaccination, the most
sub- stantial advance in eighteenth-century medicine was in surgery. The
old tie with the barber’s art survived till 1745 in England, but in
France it was</p>
<p>In 1724 Louis XV sanctioned the creation of five chairs of surgery in
the College de St. -Come at Paris. The Faculty of Medicine at the
University of Paris protested against exalting surgery to such dignity;
the physicians, decked out in their red scholastic robes and preceded by
a beadle and an usher, marched to St.-Come, where a lecture on surgery
was in process; finding the door locked, they tried to break it open,
and shouted impreca- tions against surgeons as upstart barbers; but the
crowd that had assembled turned upon the physicians and drove them away.
In 1731 Georges</p>
<p>Marechal and Francois de La Peyronie secured a royal charter to found
the Academie de Chirurgie (Academy of Surgery); and in 1743 the King</p>
<p>issued an ordinance freeing the surgeons of France from union with
the barbers’ guild, and requiring a college degree as prerequisite to
surgical practice. Henceforth a surgeon could look a physician in the
face.</p>
<p>A similar development took place in England. In 1 745 the surgeons
were formally separated from the barbers, and it was made a penal
offense to</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>practice surgery in or near London without examination and licensing
by a committee of master surgeons; the Royal College of Surgeons,
however, was not officially chartered till 1800. In Germany, before
Frederick the Great, surgery was mainly in the hands of barbers,
executioners, and stroll- ing unlicensed practitioners who set bones,
couched cataracts, bound up hernias, and cut out stones. In the army —
which was Prussia’s pride— the surgeon was called Feldscherer, field
cutter, because his functions included serving as barber to the
officers. But a Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum was opened in Berlin in
1724.</p>
<p>Most of the great surgeons of the eighteenth century were French.
Jean Louis Petit invented the screw tourniquet, and made improvements in
amputations and herniotomy. Diderot, in The Dream of d’Alembert, made
the famous physician Theophile de Bordeu describe an operation on the
brain by La Peyronie. Jean Andre Venel of Geneva founded surgical</p>
<p>orthopedics (1780). In England William Cheselden developed the
lateral operation for stone (1727) to a point hardly improved upon
since, 40 and boasted of having performed one lithotomy in fifty-four
seconds. English surgery became a science when John Hunter established
it on the basis of sound anatomy and physiology. He experimented on
animals to find sub- stitutes for operations often fatal in man. In 1
786, having discovered, in the case of a buck, that collateral blood
vessels can continue the circulation when passage through a main trunk
is arrested, he saved the life of a man suffering an aneurysm of the leg
by tying the artery above the swelling and relying upon the surrounding
parts of the body to absorb the contents of the tumor. This operation
has saved countless limbs and lives.</p>
<p>John Hunter’s name stands high also in the development of dentistry.
In seventeenth-century England this art was mostly left to tooth
pullers, who cried out their arrival and displayed strings of teeth as
their coat of arms. In 1728 Pierre Fauchard proclaimed dentistry a
branch of surgery, in his treatise Le Chirugien dentiste. But Hunter was
the first to apply scientific methods to the study of teeth. He
introduced their classification as cuspids, bicuspids, molars, and
incisors; he devised appliances for correcting maloc- clusion; and he
was the first to recommend complete removal of the pulp before filling a
tooth. He summed up his views in his Natural History of the Human T eeth
(1771).</p>
<p>Most minor operations were performed without anesthesia. The ancients
had used various soporific potions — “nepenthe,” opium, henbane, man -
drake, hemlock, etc.; God himself, said the Book of Genesis, put Adam
into “a deep sleep” before taking out a rib. Dioscorides, in the first
century of the Christian Era, prescribed mandragora wine in surgical
operations. 41 India used Cannabis indica (Indian hemp). Surgical
sleeping draughts were mentioned by Origen in the second century, and by
St. Hilary of Poitiers</p>
<p>6oo</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>in the fourth. Most of the old soporifics continued in use in the
Middle Ages; so the famous medical school of Salerno advocated a
“sleeping sponge.” In modern Europe the favorite anesthetic was
drunkenness. Only in 1799 did Sir Humphry Davy discover the anesthetic
properties of nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”). The anesthetic
possibilities of ether were discov - ered in 1839 by Dr. Crawford Long
of Danielsville, Georgia.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE PHYSICIANS</li>
</ol>
<p>The growth of wealth, the rise of the middle classes in number and
purse, and the progress of medical science and education gave a higher
status and income to physicians than they had usually known before. La
Mettrie, him- self a physician, rejoiced: “Everything gives way to the
great art of the healer. The doctor is the one philosopher who deserves
well of his</p>
<p>country. . . . The mere sight of him restores our calm, . . . and
breeds fresh hope.” 42 Voltaire was critical of medicines— “regimen is
superior to medicine”; and of most doctors— “out of every hundred
physicians ninety - eight are char latans”; but he added: “Men who are
occupied in the restora - tion of health to other men, by the joint
exercise of skill and humanity, are above all the great of the earth.
They even partake of divinity, since to preserve and renew is almost as
noble as to create.” 43 Diderot praised the Faculty of Medicine in the
University of Paris 44 whose Faculty of The- ology was the bane of his
life. “There are no books I read more gladly,” he said, “than books
about medicine, no men whose conversation is more interesting to me than
that of doctors — but only when I am well.” 45 He made Dr. de Bordeu the
central character in Le Reve d’Alembert. The profession was satirized as
usual, as in the plays of Goldoni, the pictures of Chodowiecki, the
Ferdinand Count Fathom of Smollett, and the delectable caricatures of
Thomas Rowlandson.</p>
<p>Better fees and incomes raised physicians to better status. Most of
them, in England, charged a guinea for a visit. Some of them earned six
thousand pounds a year. Sir Hans Sloane, the first physician to be made
a baronet, be- came president of the Royal Society, and Josef von Quarin
was made a baron by Joseph II of Austria. Physicians were welcomed in
the best clubs of London, in the best salons of Paris. They no longer
wore the lugubrious soutane, or black robe; they dressed in the best
fashion of the upper middle class. In England they displayed a coat of
red satin or brocade, knee breeches, buckled shoes, goldheaded cane, and
sometimes a sword; in France they dressed with the pomp of a high
ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>Some physicians call for special remembrance. Simon Andre Tissot was
famous in Lausanne as a leading advocate of inoculation and an
authority</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>MEDICINE</p>
<p>601</p>
<p>on epilepsy; he labored not only to heal the sick but also to keep
the well well; his Avis au peuple sur la sante, or Advice to the People
on Health (1760), ran through ten editions in six years, and was
translated into every major language of Europe. Leopold Auenbrugger was
chief in a circle of great doctors who gave honor to Vienna under Maria
Theresa; he was loved for his modesty, honesty, and charity, “a noble
example of the sub - stantial worth and charm of old-fashioned German
character at its very best.” 46 Not quite so popular was Dr. Joseph
Ignace Guillotin, who served as a deputy in the States-General of 1789,
upheld capital punishment, and proposed the use of a beheading machine
that would avoid the misstrokes of executioners. And Theodore Tronchin
was the most famous physician in Switzerland.</p>
<p>He was a favorite pupil of Boerhaave at Leiden, practiced twenty
years in Amsterdam, married the granddaughter of Jan de Witt, moved back
to his native Geneva, and there introduced inoculation (1749) by
beginning on himself and his children. In 1756 the Due d’Orleans invited
him to Paris to inoculate his son the Due de Chartres and his daughter
the current Mile, de Montpensier. Paris marveled at such courage; but
when the patients came through with no perceivable harm, the elite world
flocked to Tron- chin’s lodgings in the Palais -Royal, eager to be made
immune to a disease that had long maintained a high rate of mortality in
France.</p>
<p>His success gave weight to his views on other matters. He preceded
Rousseau in urging mothers to nurse their children. He told his patients
to take less medicine and more exercise in the open air, to eat simple
foods, to bathe more frequently, to wash in cold water, discard their
wigs, night- caps, and bed curtains, and retire and rise at an early
hour. He startled the court at Versailles by ordering the windows of the
palace — which had always remained closed — to be opened at least part
of every day, even in winter. His ideas became fashionable. Highborn
ladies took walks in the early morning hours, clad, for ventilation’s
sake, in short skirts that were soon named tronchines . 47</p>
<p>When Voltaire settled in Geneva he put himself under Tronchin’s care.
“He is a man six feet tall,” said Voltaire, “wise as Aesculapius, and as
hand - some as Apollo.” 48 Tronchin did not reciprocate these
compliments, but, as Voltaire said of himself and Haller, perhaps, they
were both mistaken. Mme. d’F.pinay, who had come all the way from Paris
to Geneva to take treatment from Tronchin, gave a very flattering
picture of him:</p>
<p>I am going to spend two or three days at Voltaire’s house with M.</p>
<p>Tronchin. Really, I discover every day new features in Tronchin</p>
<p>which inspire me with boundless respect and regard for him. His</p>
<p>charity, his distinterestedness, his affection and care for his wife,
are</p>
<p>602</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>unexampled. Now that I know her, I declare to you that she is the</p>
<p>sulkiest and most unendurable woman in existence . 49</p>
<p>But who can trust one woman on another?</p>
<p>It was not an especially great century in the history of medicine;
the medical scene was still darkened with mysticism, quackery, and
theories that should already have been shamed by experience. But the
progress of anatomy and physiology had now placed medicine upon a
sounder basis than before; medical education was more thorough and more
widely avail- able; unlicensed practice was fading away; specialties
were increasing knowledge and improving care; surgery was liberated;
miraculous cures were losing repute; and the triumphs of medicine were
playing their quiet part in that basic conflict between faith and reason
which was taking the forefront in the life of the mind.</p>
