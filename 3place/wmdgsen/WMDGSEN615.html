Transition</h4>
<p>I. THE PRESS</p>
<p>I F France held the political stage in this era, England led in
literature.</p>
<p>What, except for Chateaubriand’s prose, has France to compare with
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley? — not to include Keats ( 1795
—</p>
<p>1821), whose masterpieces slip out of our present range. Next to the
age of Elizabeth I, this was the brightest flowering in the four
centuries of English poetry.</p>
<p>Even correspondence could then be literature, for the letters of
Byron and Coleridge seem more contemporary with us than their verse.: In
those days, when, usually, the recipient paid the postage, he demanded
substance or style for his stamp; but to receive a letter from such
ebullient spirits could be a passport to life after death.</p>
<p>The newspapers, however, were not literature. Normally each was a
sheet folded into four pages; the first and fourth of these were taken
up by advertisements, the second went to politics, including a summary
of yester- day’s Parliamentary doings. London had several dailies:
chiefly the. Times, founded in 1788, and having some five thousand
purchasers; the Courier , with ten thousand; the Morning Post, organ of
the Whigs, and featuring “leaders” by Coleridge; and the Examiner, voice
of liberals like Le igh Hunt. County or borough centers had each its own
paper, sometimes two, one for the Ins and one for the Outs. There were
several weeklies, of which the most popular was William Cobbett’s
Political Register. And there were</p>
<p>The power of the press was a prominent element in the British scene.
It was no longer a vehicle of literature as in the leisurely days of
Addison and Steele; it had become an outlet for advertisers and an organ
of political groups. Since the advertisers paid according to
circulation, the editor and the publishers had to consider public
opinion, often at the expense of the party in power; so the press
lampooned the wastrel sons of the King despite all efforts of the
government to shield them. Gradually, as the nineteenth century
advanced, the press became an instrument, finally an indispensable
constituent, of the rising democracy.</p>
<p>To be distinguished from Sir William Sidney Smith, who foiled
Napoleon at Acre.</p>

<p>LITERATURE IN TRANSITION</p>
<p>409</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>BOOKS</li>
</ol>
<p>Books multiplied as the middle class and the reading public grew.
Pub- lishing became sufficiently profitable to be an independent
business, sepa- rate from bookselling. Publishers competed for authors,
paid them better, feted them at literary salons. So Joseph Johnson wined
and published God- win, Paine, and Blake; Archibald Constable shared his
debts with Walter Scott; Thomas Norton Longman took Wordsworth; Joseph
Cottle, at Bris- tol, kept Coleridge and Southey; and John Murray, from
London, held wandering Byron in leash. Meanwhile the old firm of
Longmans spent three hundred thousand pounds publishing a new edition
(1819) of Chambers’ Cyclopoedia, in thirty-nine volumes; and the
Encyclopaedia Britannica issued three new editions in this brief period
— the third, in eighteen volumes, in 1788-97, the fourth in twenty
volumes in 1810, the fifth in twenty-five vol- umes in 1815.</p>
<p>Instead of royalties, publishers paid lump sums for manuscripts, and
added something if further editions were printed and sold; nevertheless
very few authors lived by their pens — Thomas Moore comfortably, Southey
and Haz- litt precariously, Scott through riches and ruin. Publishers
succeeded patri- cians as patrons of literature, but some moneyed men
still held out a hand; so the Wedgwoods subsidized Coleridge, and
Raisley Calvert bequeathed nine hundred pounds to Wordsworth. The
government sent occasional honorar- iums to well-behaved authors, and
maintained a poet laureate at a hundred pounds; for this he was expected
to compose on the instant a poem celebrat- ing a victory of the armed
forces, or a royal birth, marriage, or death.</p>
<p>The growth of the reading public was checked by the high price of</p>
<p>books, but was promoted by book clubs and lending libraries. Best of
the latter were the Athenaeum and the Lyceum, both at Liverpool, the one
with eight thousand volumes, the other with eleven thousand. Subscribers
paid an annual fee, from one to two and a half guineas, for the right to
borrow any book on the shelves. Every, town had its lending library.
Something was lost in taste and standards as reading spread from the
aristocracy through the commonalty. The transition from classic
tradition to Romantic senti- ment was fed by this spreading audience,
and by the growing emancipation of youthful love from parental control
and property bonds; and one love affair could do for a hundred plots.
Richardson’s tearful themes were gain - ing ground from Fielding’s lusty
lovers and Smollett’s virile adventurers.</p>
<p>Women predominated among the novelists, except for Matthew “Monk”
Lewis and his chamber of horrors, Ambrosio, or The Monk (1795). Next
only to him in the terror and mystery school was Mrs. Ann Radcliffe,
with her succession of successes: A Sicilian Romance (1790), The Romance
of the Forest (1791), and The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794). Usually the
English public called such books romances (from the French word roman ,
meaning a story), and kept the term novel for extended narratives of
natu-</p>
<p>410 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXral happenings in ordinary life, as in Fielding and Jane Austen;
Scott’s Waverley Novels bridge the definitions. In Romantic fiction the
women au- thors naturally excelled. Frances (Fanny) Burney, who, at
twenty-six, had made a stir with Evelina (1778), went on to sparkle with
Cecilia (1782), Camilla (1796), and The Wanderer (1814); and after her
death (1840) her Diary ( 1 842 ) charmed another generation.</p>
<p>Even more famous was Maria Edgeworth, whose Castle Rackrent (1800)
and The Absentee (1812?) gave in fictional but realistic form such
power- ful descriptions of Irish exploitation by English landlords that
England it- self was stirred to mitigate these evils. Only one woman
writer of her gen- eration surpassed her, and that woman surpassed the
men as well.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>JANE AUSTEN: 1775-1817</li>
</ol>
<p>All her adventures were by proxy, through her pen; and even there she
needed few, since she found sufficient fascination in the ordinary life
of genteel, but educated and sensitive, women like herself. Her father
was rec- tor of Steventon parish in Hampshire. She was born in the
parsonage, and lived there till she was twenty-six. In 1809 her brother
Edward provided his mother and sisters with a home in Chawton. There she
lived till her final year, varying her simple routine with visits to her
brothers and a stay in London. In May, 1817, she went to Winchester for
medical treatment, and there, on July 1 8, she died, unmarried, aged
forty-one.</p>
<p>She gave suspense and meaning to her life by the sisterly love that
warms her letters; by her subtle and slightly sardonic humor, which
caught the ab- surdities and hidden anxieties of life, and portrayed
them without bitterness; and by her enjoyment of the rural scenery and
easy tempo of provincial days. She had enough of London to dislike it;
she gave no fond picture of it, as a cross between dingy poverty and
well-bred decay; it was a place where bored country girls came to be
seduced. The finer sort of English living, she felt, was in the lower
aristocracy of the countryside; in their homes family discipline and a
treasured tradition generated stability and a quiet content. In those
pockets of peace one seldom heard of the French Revolution, and Napoleon
was too distant a bogey to take one’s mind off the more urgent business
of getting a fit partner for the dance or for life. Re- ligion had its
place in those homes, but kept it, and had been pared of its terrors by
a secret sophistication, such as might well flourish in a parsonage. The
Industrial Revolution had not yet reached into the countryside to em-
bitter the classes and sully scene and air. We hear Jane Austen’s
authentic voice in her commiseration with Fanny Price, who had to spend
some un- willing months in London:</p>
<p>It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring…. She had not
known before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation had de-
lighted her. What animation, both of body and mind, she had derived

<p>watching the advance of that season which cannot, in spite of its
capricious- ness, be unlovely, seeing its increasing beauties from the
earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt’s garden, to the
opening leaves of her uncle’ s plantations and the glory of his woods.
1</p>
<p>It was such an environment — a comfortable home, a fragrant garden,
an evening walk with gay sisters, an encouraging word from a father
who</p>
<p>K ed and peddled her manuscripts — that put into Jane Austen’s nove
ls a air of peace, health, and goodwill, and that gives to her
unhurried</p>
<p>readers a quiet satisfaction hardly to be found in any other novels.
She had learned that the day itself is blessing enough.</p>
<p>So she wrote her six novels, and waited patiently for that unhurried
pub- lic. In 1795, aged twenty, she composed the first form of Sense and
Sensi- bility, but it did not satisfy her, and she laid it aside. In the
next two years she labored over Pride and Prejudice, revised it and
revised it, and sent it to a publisher, who returned it as promising no
profit. In 1798-99 she put into shape N or th anger Abbey; Richard
Crosby bought it, but let it lie unpub- lished. Then came a barren
interlude, disturbed by change of residence, and perhaps by
discouragement. In February, 18 n, she began Mansfield Park; and in
November Sense and Sensibility, rewritten, reached print. Then, in her
last five years, came a rich harvest: Pride and Prejudice found a pub-
lisher in 1813, Mansfield Park in 1814, Emma in 1816; and in 1817, after
her death, N onhanger Abbey surfaced, and soon Persuasion appeared.</p>
<p>Pride and Prejudice offers at the outset a bevy of five sisters, all
ready and eager for marriage. Mrs. Bennet is a flighty, exclamatory
soul, whose morn- ing prayer and hourly thought are to find husbands for
her brood. Mr. Ben- net has learned to retire from his wordy wife to his
library, where the words make no noise, and he has quite given up the
problem of providing five dowries of land or pounds. He holds his home
only till his death; there- after it goes by entail to the Reverend
Mr. Collins, the still unmarried par- son of a nearby town. If one of
those five sisters could snare that dominie!</p>
<p>The oldest and loveliest, Jane, has set her aim on the rich and
handsome Mr. Bingley, but he seems to prefer another candidate, and Jane
hardly hides her grief. Elizabeth, next in age, is proud not of her face
or form but of her independent, self-reliant character; she thinks for
herself, and is not to be auctioned off; she has read widely, and can
handle any man in a duel of mind or wit, without being aggressively
intellectual; her author frankly admires her. The third sister, Mary, is
eagerly nubile, and frets over the long time her predecessors are taking
in clearing her way. Lydia, the youngest, wonders why a girl has to wait
for the magic formula of marriage before being allowed to explore the
mysteries of sex.</p>
<p>The household is brightened by the news that Mr. Collins is planning
to pay it a visit. He is a man proudly conscious of his sanctity, but
carefully cognizant of class distinctions and material interests; in him
the author pre- sents a merciless picture of the caste subservience into
which the lower Anglican ministry had fallen; the satire seems extreme,
but it is as clean and thorough as a guillotine.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXThe young reverend comes, sees that lovely Jane is immune, and
offers his hand to Elizabeth, who demoralizes the family by refusing
him, loath to be imprisoned in his perfections. Mary, feeling that for
the third of five sisters to be first to get a husband would be quite a
trick, sets her eyes and smiles and delicate attentions upon the fated
heir to the property, and charms him into asking Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
her hand.</p>
<p>All seems well, but Lydia, fearing senile virginity, runs off, unwed,
with the dashing Mr. Wickham. The entire family is tarnished with her
sin, and is shunned by nearly all the neighbors. The Reverend
Mr. Collins sends a reproving word to Mr. Bennet: “The death of your
daughter would have been a blessing compared with this…. Who will
connect themselves with such a family?” 2 Elizabeth saves all by
alluring the class -prejudiced Mr. Darcy with her proud inaccessibility;
he lays his millions at her feet, compels Wickham to cleanse Lydia with
marriage, and, by the magic hand of the authoress as a dea ex machtna,
all problems are solved; even Mr. Bing- ley discovers that he has always
loved Jane.</p>
<p>Mansfield Park is better built: the final solution is forecast near
the outset, and is step by step prepared by almost every incident. The
characters are not puppets in a plot but souls wondering their way
through life, and properly illustrating the remark of Heracleitus (which
should be the guide of all fic- tion), that “a man’s character is his
fate.” The Park is the handsome domain of Sir Thomas Bertram, who is a
much more solicitous father than Mr. Ben- net. He too, however, makes
surprising mistakes: absorbed in pursuit of wealth and honor, he lets
his eldest son disintegrate morally and physically, and allows his
daughter to prolong their vacation in a London society where all the
morals of the countryside are the butt of humor instead of the staff of
life. It is to his credit that he adopts into his family the modest and
sensi- tive Fanny Price, the impoverished niece of his wife. His
consoling pride is his younger son Edmund, who is dedicated to the
Church, and is described as all that a future clergyman should be; he is
an apology for Mr. Col- lins. It takes Edmund several hundred pages to
realize that his affection for Fanny is more than brotherly love; but in
its leisurely course their rising at- tachment is a pleasant romance in
a classic tale.</p>
<p>For even in her studies of love Jane Austen is and was a classic — a
lasting excellence and a sober mind. In an age of Udolphian mysteries
and Wal- polian castles she remained a realistic and rational observer
of her time. Her style is as chaste as Dryden’s; her piety is as
unemotional as Pope’s. Her scope is narrow, but her probe is deep. She
perceives that the basic aspect of life is the conscription of the
individual into the service of the race; that the crises of government,
the conflicts of power, even the cries for social jus- tice are not as
fundamental as the repeated, unconscious effort of youth to mature and
be used and consumed. She takes both aspects — female and male — of the
human mystery quietly; its ills beyond her curing, its goal beyond her
ken. She never raises her voice, but we follow it willingly, so far as
the rapids of life will allow; and we can be captured by her calm. Today
there is hardly a village in England but has her worshipers.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LITERATURE IN TRANSITION</p>
<p>413</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>WILLIAM BLAKE: 1 75 7- 1 827</li>
</ol>
<p>Born eighteen years before her, enduring ten years after her, William
Blake spanned the transition to Romanticism; he lived on mystery,
rejected science, doubted God, worshiped Christ, transformed the Bible,
emulated the Prophets, and called for a utopia of earthbound saints.</p>
<p>He was the son of a London hosier. At the age of four he was
frightened by seeing God looking at him through a window. A little later
he saw angels fluttering in a tree, and the Prophet Ezekiel wandering in
a field. 3 Perhaps because his imagination mingled lawlessly with his
sensations, he was sent to no school till the age of ten; and then it
was to a drawing school in the Strand. At fifteen he began a seven-year
apprenticeship to the engraver James Basire. He read much, in cluding
such romantic lore as Percy’s Re - liques of Ancient English Poetry and
Macpherson’s “Ossian.” He himself wrote verses, and illustrated them. At
twenty-two he was accepted as a stu- dent of engraving at the Royal
Academy, but he rebeled against R eynolds’ classical injunctions; later
he lamented that he had “spent the vigor” of his “Youth and Genius under
the incubus of Sir Joshua and his Gang of cun - ning Hired Knaves.” 4
Despite them he developed his own imaginative style of drawing, and was
able to support himself with his watercolors and en- gravings.</p>
<p>He was not strongly sexual; he once expressed the hope that “sex
would vanish and cease to be.” 5 Nevertheless, aged twenty -five, he
married Cather- ine Boucher. He often tried her with his tantrums and
wearied her with his visions; but she recognized his genius, and cared
for him faithfully to his end. He had no known children, but loved to
play with those of his friends. In 1783 John Flaxman and the Reverend A.
S. Mathews paid for the private printing of Blake’s early verses; these
Poetical Sketches, when reprinted in 1868, shared in the belated
expansion of his fame. Some of them, like the rhymeless rhapsody “To the
Evening Star,” raised an original note in Eng - lish poetry. 6</p>
<p>Like any feeling soul, he resented England’s concentrated wealth and
fes - tering poverty. He joined Tom Paine, Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft,
and other radicals grouped around the publisher Joseph Johnson; together
they drank the strong wine of the French Enlightenment, and sang of
justice and equality. His appearance befitted a spirit allergic to any
imposed order. He was short and broad, with a “noble countenance full of
expression and animation. His hair was of a yellow brown, and curled
with the utmost crispness and luxuriance; his locks, instead of falling
down, stood up like a curling flame, and looked at a distance like
radiations, which, with his fiery eye and expansive forehead, his
dignified and cheerful physiognomy, must have made his appe arance truly
prepossessing.” 7</p>
<p>In 1784 he opened up a print shop on Broad Street. He took in, as
assistant, his young brother Robert. It was a happy relationship, for
each was devoted</p>
<p>4H</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXo the other; but Robert was consumptive, and his death in 1787
deepened a somber strain in William’s mood, and the mystic element in
his thought. He was convinced that he had seen Robert’s soul, at the
moment of death, rise through the ceiling, “clapping its hands for joy.”
8 To Robert’s ghost he attributed a method of engraving both text and
illustration upon one plate. Nearly all of Blake’s books were so
engraved, and were sold for prices rang - ing from a few shillings to
ten guineas. Hence his audience was narrowly limited during his
life.</p>
<p>In 1789 he issued his first masterpiece, nineteen litde Songs of
Innocence. Apparently he meant, by “innocence,” the pre -pubetic period
in which the pleasantest legends that had gathered about Christ were
happily believed, brightening and guiding growth; however, Blake was
thirty-two when the poems appeared, and we sense in them that experience
is already mourning the death of innocence. We must recall his famous
lines, that we may con- trast them with lines addressed to a tiger five
years later.</p>

<p>I a child and thou a lamb,</p>
<p>We are called by his name.</p>
<p>Little Lamb, God bless thee.</p>
<p>Litde Lamb, God bless thee.</p>
<p>Perhaps still finer is the next poem, “The Little Black Boy,” in
which a - ney Sweeper” imagines an angel coming down to free all
chimneysweeps from the coat of soot in which they work and sleep. “Holy
Thursday” ends with a warning: “Then cherish pity, lest you drive an
angel from your door.”</p>
<p>Five years passed: the years in which the French Revolution exploded,
burned brightly with idealism (1791), and then turned into massacre and
terror (1792-94). In 1789, according to one report, Blake publicly wore
the red cap of revolution, and joined Paine in attacking the Established
Church. Excited to confusion, he broke out of the ballad form into
“prophecies” echoing Jeremiah and Hosea, ominous proclamations to a
sinful world.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>LITERATURE IN TRANSITION</p>
<p>4*5</p>
<p>These are not recommended reading to those who resent manufactured
ob- scurity, but we note in passing that in The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell (a satire of Swedenborg) Blake equates these realms with innocence
and ex- perience. Some of the “Proverbs from Hell” suggest a temporarily
vege - tarian-Whitmanic-Freudian-Nietzschean radicalism:</p>
<p>All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap….</p>
<p>The most sublime act is to set another before you….</p>
<p>The pride of the peacock is the glory of God…. The nakedness of women
is the work of God….</p>
<p>Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted
desires….</p>
<p>God only Acts and Is, in existing beings or Men….</p>
<p>All deities reside in the human breast….</p>
<p>The worship of God is, Honoring his gifts in other men,… and loving
the greatest man best. Those who envy or calumniate great men hate God,
for there is no other God.</p>
<p>In Songs of Experience (1794) the poet countered his Songs of
Innocence with odes of doubts and condemnation.</p>
<p>Tyger, Tyger, burning bright</p>
<p>In the forests of the night,</p>
<p>What immortal hand or eye</p>
<p>Could frame thy fearful symmetry?…</p>
<p>And what shoulder, and what art,</p>
<p>Could twist the sinews of thy heart?</p>
<p>And when thy heart began to beat,</p>
<p>What dread hands and what dread feet?…</p>
<p>When the stars threw down their spears</p>
<p>And watered heaven with their tears,</p>
<p>Did he smile his work to see?</p>
<p>Did he who made the Lamb make thee?</p>
<p>Whereas in Songs of Innocence “A Little Boy Lost” is rescued by God
and brought back rejoicing to his home, a corresponding “song of
experience”</p>
<p>Is this a holy thing to see</p>
<p>In a rich and fruitful land,</p>
<p>Babes reduced to misery,</p>
<p>Fed with cold and usurous hand?</p>
<p>Is that trembling cry a song?</p>
<p>Can it be a song of joy?</p>
<p>And so many children poor?</p>
<p>It is a land of poverty.</p>
<p>Against such evils revolution no longer seemed a valid cure; for “The
iron hand crushed the Tyrant’s head, And became a Tyrant in his stead.”
9 Dis - appointed with violent revolt, Blake sought solace in his
residual religious belief. He now distrusted science as the handmaid of
materialism, the tool</p>

<p>After 1 8 1 8 Blake wrote little poetry, found few readers, and
supported himself by his art. At times, in his sixties, he was so poor
that he had to en- grave advertisements for Wedgwood pottery. In 1819 he
found a saving patron in John Linnell, who commissioned him to
illustrate the Book of Job and Dante’s Divine Comedy. He was working on
this final ta sk when death came to him (1827). No stone marked his
grave, but, a full century later, a tablet was erected on the spot; and
in 1957 a bronze bust by Sir Jacob Epstein was placed in Westminster
Abbey.</p>
<p>At his death the transition to Romanticism was complete. It had begun
timidly, in the very heyday of classicism, with Thomson’s Seasons
(1730), Collins’ Odes (1747), Richardson’s Clarissa Harlowe(ij^j),
Gray’s Elegy (1751), Rousseau’s Julie, ou La Nouvelle Helots e (1761),
Macpherson’s Fingal (1762), Walpole’s Castle of Otranto (1764), Percy’s
Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1768), Scottish and German ballads,
Chatterton’s remarkable forgeries (1769), Goethe’s Werther (1774). In
truth there had been romantics in every age, in every home, in every
lass and youth; classi- cism was a precarious structure of rule and
restraint overlaid upon impulses and passions running like liquid fire
in the blood.</p>
<p>Then the French Revolution came, and even its collapse brought
libera- tion. Old forms of law and order lost prestige and force;
feeling, imagina- tion, aspiration, old impulses of violence in word and
deed were set free; youth started fires of poetry and art under every
literary rule, every moral prohibition, every constricting creed, every
law-encrusted state. In 1798 Wordsworth and Coleridge came together in
writing the poems and pref- aces of Lyrical Ballads; Burns and Scott
were singing of love, revolt, and war in Scotland; Napoleon’s armies
were shattering shibboleths faster than revolution could spread its
dream. Everywhere literature had become the voice of freedom in revolt.
Seldom had the future seemed so open, hope so limitless, or the world so
young.</p>
