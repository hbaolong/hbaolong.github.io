<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>From Dry den to Swift</p>
<p>1660 — 1714</p>
<p>I. A FREE PRESS</p>
<p>W HAT could have led a Frenchman to write that “in 1712 England</p>
<p>surpassed France in quantity and quality of literary production,”</p>
<p>that “the center of intellectual life . . . unceasingly moved toward
the north,” until, about 1700, the English “held the highest creative
role”? 1 An Englishman schooled in French graces could return the
compliment: part of the stimulus came from French manners imported by
Charles II and the returning emigres; part of it came from Descartes and
Pascal, Corneille and Racine, Moliere and Boileau, Mile, de Scudery and
Mme. de La Fayette, and from Frenchmen living in England, like
Saint-Evremond and Gramont. We see the French influence in the erotic
comedies and heroic tragedies of the Restoration theater, and in the
passage from the exuberance of Eli zabethan prose, and the convolutions
of Milton’s periods, to the refined and reasoned prose of Dryden writing
prefaces and Pope writing poetry. For a century now (1670-1770) English
literature would be prose, even when it scanned and rhymed; but it would
be stately, clear, and classical prose.</p>
<p>The French influence, however, was only a prod; the root of the
matter was in England itself, in her joyous and liberating Restoration,
her colonial expansion, her commercial enrichment in ideas, her naval
victories over the Dutch, her triumph (1713) over the France that had
triumphed over Spain. So the course of empire northward made its way.
And as Louis XIV gave pensions to authors as douceurs to docility, in a
kindred manner the English government rewarded patriotic (or partisan)
poets or proseurs — Dryden, Congreve, Gay, Prior, Addison, Swift — with
pensions, dinners with the aristocracy, introductions to royalty,
sinecures in the administra- tion; one of them became secretary of
state; Voltaire noted with envy these political plums. 2 Charles II
favored science and beauty rather than letters or art; William III and
Anne were indifferent to literature; but their ministers — finding
authors useful in an age of newspapers, pamphlets, coffeehouses, and
propaganda — subsidized the pens that could serve the Crown, the party,
or the sword. Writers became minor politicians; some, like Prior, became
diplomats; some, like Swift and Addison, manipulated</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>313</p>
<p>patronage and power. In grateful appreciation of favors to come,
authors dedicated their works to lords and ladies with compliments that
made these superior to Apollo or Venus in body, and to Shakespeare or
Sappho in mind.</p>
<p>Freedom help ed gold to release the inky flood. Milton’s Areopagitica
had failed to end the Licensing Act through which censorship had con-
trolled the press under Tudor and Stuart rulers, and that act continued
in force under Cromwell precarious and the Stuarts restored. But as the
government of James II began to frighten the nation, more and more
pamphleteers defied the law and pleased the people. When William III
came to the throne he and his Whig supporters owed so much to the press
that they opposed the renewal of the Licensing Act; it expired in 1694,
and was not renewed; freedom of the press was automatically established.
The royal ministers might still arrest for extreme attacks upon the
government, and the Blasphemy Act of 1697 still decreed stiff penalties
for questioning the fundamentals of the Christian creed; but England
henceforth enjoyed a literary liberty which, though often abused,
contributed immensely to the growth of the English mind.</p>
<p>Periodicals multiplied. Weekly newspapers had circulated since 1622.
Cromwell suppressed all but two of them; Charles II allowed three, under
official supervision; one of these, the Oxford (then London) Gazette,
be- came the organ of the government, and has appeared biweekly or semi-
weekly ever since 1665. Soon after the decease of the Licensing Act
several new weeklies ventured forth. In 1695 the Tories established the
first English daily, The Post Boy, which lasted only four days; the
Whigs at once countered it with The Flying Post. Finally, in 1702, The
English</p>
<p>Courant became the first regular daily newspaper in England — a small
sheet printed on one side only, and containing news but not views. From
these fitful flurries came the advertising mammoths of our day.</p>
<p>Defoe set a new standard with The Review (1704-13), a weekly offering
comments as well as news, and originating the serial story. Steele
followed with The Tatler (1709-1 1), and he and Addison brought the
development to its historic peak in The Spectator (1711-12). The Tory
government, alarmed by the aggregate circulation (44,000) and influence
of the dailies, weeklies, and monthlies, laid upon them (1712) a stamp
tax ranging from a halfpenny to a penny, which was intended to make life
impossible for most of the periodicals. The Spectator was one of those
that succumbed. “All Grub Street is ruined,” Swift told his Stella. 8
Bolingbroke started the weekly Examiner in 1710 to defend the policies
of the Tory ministry; he found in Jonathan Swift a contributor
formidable in knowledge, invective, and wit; money had discovered a new
instrument. Gradually the power of the periodical press overtook the
influence of the pulpit in forming the</p>

<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>public mind to private purposes, and a new secularizing force entered
into history.</p>

<li>THE RESTORATION DRAMA</li>
</ol>
<p>There was another medium that between 1660 and 1700 formed, de-
formed, or merely expressed, the soul of soulless London. Charles II,
having relished the Parisian drama, licensed two theaters: one for the
King’s Company in Drury Lane, one for the Duke of York’s Company in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields. In 1705 the Queen’s Theatre opened in
Haymarket,</p>
<p>In the tragic drama of the Restoration the great name is Dryden. We
put him asid e for the moment, and open Thomas Otway’s Venice
Preserved</p>
<ol start="1904" type="1">
<li>It is a love story grafted upon the conspiracy of Count de Osuna’s
friends to overthrow the Venetian Senate in 1616. Its early success was
due in part to its caricature of the first Earl of Shaftesbury (Charles
II’s foe and Locke’s friend) in the character of Antonio, who loves to
be beaten by his bawd; partly to the resemblance of the conspiracy to
the recent Popish</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. Xl) FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT 315</p>
<p>Plot; partly to the acting of Thomas Betterton and Mrs. Elizabeth
Barry. But the play now stands on its own feet. The comic scenes are
absurd and offensive, and the finale scatters death with operatic
unanimity; but the plot is well woven, the characters are distinctively
drawn, the action is intensely dramatic, and the blank verse rivals
anything in Elizabethan drama barring Marlowe and Shakespeare. Otway
fell in love with Mrs. Barry, who preferred to amuse the Earl of
Rochester. After writing some further successes the poet produced a
series of failures, drifted into poverty, and (in one account) died of
starvation. 9</p>
<p>It is for its comedies that the Restoration drama is remembered.
Their humor and wit, their bawdy dialogue and bedroom escapades, and
their value as a mirror of one class in one generation, have given them
a hardy if stealthy popularity which they scarcely deserve. Their range
is narrow a§ compared with the Elizabethan comedies, or Moliere’s; they
describe not life, but the manners of town idlers and court profligates;
they ignore the countryside except as a butt of ridicule, or as a
Siberia to which husbands banish prying wives. Some English dramatists
saw Moliere play or played in Paris; some of them borrowed his
characters or plots; but none rose to his flair for discussing basic
ideas. The one basic idea in these comedies is that adultery is the main
purpose and most heroic business of life. Their ideal man is described
in Dryden’s Mock Astrologer as “a gentleman, a man about town, one that
wears good clothes, eats, drinks, and wenches suf- ficiently.” A
character in Farquhar’s Beaux’ Stratagem says, a s one gentle- man to
another: “I love a fine horse, but let another keep it; and just so I
love a fine woman” 10 — which means not that he will not covet his
neighbor’s wife, but that he proposes to enjoy her favors while letting
her husband support he r. In Congreve’s Way of the World the admired</p>
<p>Mirabell says to his friend’s wife: “You should have just so much
disgust for your husband as may be sufficient to make you relish your
lover.” 11 Rarely, in these plays, does love rise above its physical
basis of mutual itching for mutual titillation. We hunger, as we read
them, for some ray of nobility, but we are offered, as an ideal, the
ethics of the stews.</p>
<p>William Wycherley set the tone and pace. His father was a royalist of
ancient family and large estate, who, when the Puritans came to power,
sent the boy to France for education, resolved that he should never be a
Puritan. William never was, but he shocked his family by becoming a
Catholic. Restored to England and soon to Protestantism, he studied at
Oxford, left without a degree, took to writing plays. At thirty-two he
struck gold with Love in a Wood (1671), which he dedicated to Lady
Castlemaine. He was received at court by the amiable King, who did not
complain when he found that Wycherley, as well as Churchill, was supple-
menting him in Milady’s love. 12</p>
<p>He fought in the Dutch War of 1672 with the bravery expected of a</p>
<p>Jl 6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>gentleman, returned to England whole, and scored another success with
The Country Wife (1673). The prologue invited the audience, if it
disliked the play, to enter the dressing room of the actors at the
close, where</p>
<p>We patiently . . . give up to you</p>
<p>Our poets, virgins, nay, our mistresses too.</p>
<p>Mr. Pinchwife has brought his spouse to London for a week, and guards
her so thoroughly that she is seduced under his nose. A Mr. Homer,
return- ing from France and desiring unhindered access to wives, spreads
the rumor that he is a eunuch. Pinchwife concludes that to such an
incompetent he may safely open his home. Soon he finds his wife writing
a love letter to the maimed gallant. He forces her to write another,
which calls Homer the vilest names; while his back is turned she
substitutes her first letter for the angry one; the husband, proud in
domination, delivers the original missive to Homer. Later, suspecting
that Homer is an abler man than rumor described him, he thinks to keep
him occupied by agreeing to take his sister Alithea to him. The wife
disguises herself as Alithea, and is delivered by her husband to her
paramour. The play ends with a “Dance of the Cuckolds,” Horner has the
last triumphant word, and an epilogue, spoken by an actress, chides the
men in the audience for insufficient virility:</p>
<p>And men may still believe you vigorous,</p>
<p>But then we women — there’s no cozening us. 13</p>
<p>Wycherley had taken much of The Country Wife from Moliere’s</p>
<p>Ecole des maris and Ecole des femmes. His next comedy, The Plain
Dealer (1674), transformed the Alceste of Moliere’s Misanthrope into
Captain Manly, whose notion of plain dealing is to berate all persons
and all things with billingsgate. The surprising thing is that London,
and even some sur- burbanites, liked to have life described as a round
of carnal seeking seasoned with profanity. In a bookstore at Tunbridge
Wells Wycherley had the ecstasy of hearing a lady ask for his recently
published Plain Dealer. She was the Countess of Drogheda, a rich widow.
He courted her, married her, and found that she kept him under
surveillance with more than Pinchwife’s continuity and vision. Suddenly
she died, and he thought himself now possessed of her fortune; but the
legacy was so cob webbed with lawsuits that he could not use any of it.
Unable to pay the debts that he had</p>
<p>confidently contracted, he was sent to jail, where he languished for
seven years, until James II, before or after Wycherley’s reconversion
to</p>
<p>Catholicism, paid his debts and pensioned him. He lived to a bad old
age, pursuing women beyond his capacity, and writing verses that his
young friend Pope struggled to turn into poetry. At seventy-five the old
rake married a young woman. Ten days later he died (January 1,
1716).</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>3*7</p>
<p>Sir John Vanbrugh was the most amiable of these adulterographers. He
was John Bull incarnate, rough, jolly, good-natured, loving the food and
drink of England; yet his grandfather was Gillis van Brugg, a Fleming
from Ghent, who came to Britain in the reign of James I. John was</p>
<p>promising enough to be sent to Paris at nineteen to study art.
Returning at twenty-one, he joined the army, was arrested at Calais as a
British spy, served a term in the Bastille, and there wrote the first
draft of The Provoked Wife. Released, he turned his versatile hand to
playwriting. In six weeks, he tells us, he conceived, wrote, and staged
The Relapse (1696), with its hilarious satires of the London fop as Lord
Foppington, of the country squire as Sir Tunbelly Clumsey, and the
ruttish Miss Hoyden. Sir</p>
<p>Tunbelly has kept her under watch and guard since puberty, and
rejoices in her innocence: “Poor girl, she’ll be scared out of her wits
on her</p>
<p>wedding night, for, honestly speaking, she does not know a man from a
woman b ut by his beard and his breeches.” 14 But Miss Hoyden describes
herself otherwise: “It’s well I have a husband a - coming, or ecod, I’d
marry the baker, I would so! Nobody can knock at the gate but presently
I</p>
<p>must be locked up; and here’s the young greyh ound bitch can run
loose about the house all day long, she can.” When Tom Fashion asks for
her hand, and her father wants them to wait a week, she protests: “A
week! — why, I shall be an old woman by that time!” 15</p>
<p>This Relapse succeeded so well that Vanbrugh hurried to complete The
Provoked Wife (1697). This was one of the greatest “hits” of the time;
half a century later David Garrick was still amusing London with his
riotous playing of Sir John Brute, the most memorable character in all
the dramatis personae of the Restoration. Sir John is a caricature of
the more porcine aspects of the English squire — drinking, boasting,
blustering, bullying, cursing, and complaining that “ ’tis a damned
atheistical age.” H e opens the play with his opinion of marriage:</p>
<p>What cloying meat is love, when matrimony is the sauce to it! Two</p>
<p>years’ marriage has debauched my five senses. Everything I see, every
- thing I hear, everything I feel, everything I smell, and everything
I</p>
<p>taste, methinks, has wife in’t: No boy was ever so weary of his</p>
<p>tutor, no girl of her bib, no nun of doing penance, or old maid
of</p>
<p>being chaste, as I am of being married.</p>
<p>His wife, knowing his views, thinks to tame him with horns:</p>
<p>lady brute. He has used me so barbarously of late that I could</p>
<p>almost resolve to play the downright wife, and cuckold him. . . .</p>
<p>Belinda. But, you know, we must return good for evil.</p>
<p>lady brute. That may be a mistake in the translation. 16</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>3 l8</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Her neighbor Lady Fanciful, similarly inclined, discusses her qualms
with her French maid, who answers in French, here translated:</p>
<p>lady f. My reputation, mademoiselle, my reputation!</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Madame, when one has once lost it, one is no longer
embarrassed by it.</p>
<p>lady f. Fie! mademoiselle, fie! Reputation is a jewel.</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Which costs much, madame.</p>
<p>lady f. Why, sure, you would not sacrifice your honor to your</p>
<p>pleasure?</p>
<p>mademoiselle. I am a philosopher. . . .</p>
<p>lady f. Honor is against it 〔a rendezvous〕.</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Pleasure is for it. . . .</p>
<p>lady f. But when reason corrects nature, mademoiselle —</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Reason is then very insolent, since nature is reason’s
older sister.</p>
<p>lady f. Do you then prefer your nature to your reason?</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Yes, certainly.</p>
<p>lady f. Why?</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Because my nature make me very merry, my reason</p>
<p>make me mad. 17</p>
<p>It was probably this play that angered Jeremy Collier into
publishing, in the year following its production, a powerful attack upon
the Restora- tion drama, especially upon Vanbrugh. Collier was an
Anglican clergyman of some learning and dogmatic courage. Having sworn
allegiance to James II in 1685, he refused to take the oath of loyalty
to William and Mary in</p>
<ol start="1689" type="1">
<li>He denounced the Glorious Revolution, even to inciting revolt. He
was arrested, and was with difficulty persuaded to let his friends bail
him out. He gave public absolution to two men about to be hanged for
con- spiring against what he considered a usurping government. Denounced
by his bishop and indicted by the Attorney General, he refused to appear
be- fore a court. He was outlawed, and lived under the ban till his
death; but the government respected his integrity, and took no further
steps against him. William III expressed warm approval of Collier’s
historic blast.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was called A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the
English Stage. There was much nonsense in it, as in most books; the pas-
sionate pastor denounced in the English drama many faults that now seem
to us trivial or no faults at all; he protested against any irreverent
reference to reverends, and generously spread this umbrella of
ineffability over pagan prophets, Catholic priests, and Dissenting
divines. He condemned so many dramatists, from Aeschylus to Shakespeare
to Congreve and Dryden, that all the indicted might feel acquitted by
their company. He weakened his case by arguing that the public stage
should not deal with crime or im-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT 3 1 9</p>
<p>morality at all. But he struck some healthy blows, for shining
targets faced him everywhere. He mourned the effect, upon audiences, of
the admira- tion which several Restoration dramatists had shown for the
addicts of adultery. For a year the book was the talk of London. The
playwrights offered diverse defenses. Vanbrugh turned from drama to
architecture, labored for a decade over Blenheim Palace, then built
Castle Howard in fine Palladian style (1714). Dryden admitted his sins
and expressed repentance. Congreve denied his guilt, but reformed his
art.</p>
<p>William Congreve brought the Restoration drama to its apex and</p>
<p>conclusion. He was bom near Leeds (1670) of a family whose antiquity
remained through all his triumphs his dearest pride. His father was
given command of an English garrison in Ireland, so William was educated
at Kilkenny School, where he sat on the same bench as Jonathan Swift;
then at Trinity College, Dublin; then at Middle Temple, London. The vims
of literary ambition entered his blood from an environment in which even
dukes wrote books. In his first year as a law student he wrote Incognita
(1692), which Edmund Gosse p raised for its “light raillery and humour”
and as “the earliest novel 〔of manners?〕 in English,” 18 but of
which</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson said, “I would rather praise than read it.” 19 Fame
came to Congreve at a bound with his first comedy, The Old Bachelor
(1693). Dryden, then the acknowledged head of English letters, vowed
that he had never seen so good a first play. Not sure that a gentleman
should write for the theater, Congreve excused himsel f as having
written it “to amuse myself in a slow recovery from a fit of sickness”;
whereupon Collier re - marked: “What his disease was, I am not to
inquire; but it must be a very ill one to be worse than the remedy.” 20
Halifax agreed with Dryden; he appointed Congreve to two government
posts, which brought sufficient income to enable him to remain a
gentleman while being a dramatist.</p>
<p>His next play, The Double Dealer (1694), had a poor reception,
but</p>
<p>Dryden’s encomium, equating Congreve with Shakes peare, held up the
young author’s spirit; and in 1695, aged twenty -five, he returned to
the boards with Love for Love, whose success exceeded any in living
memory. Collier denounced the play as giving aid and comfort to lechers.
Congreve’s reply fell so flat that for three years he kept from the
theater. When he returned to it with The Way of the World (1700) he had
profited from the castigation, and showed that wit did not depend upon
inverting the Decalogue. This play, which the hyperbolic Swinburn e
called “the un - equalled and unapproached masterpiece of English
comedy,” 21 has some of the faults, but none of the vices, of the
Restoration drama. When merely read it may tire us with its bantering
wit, reminding us of the silly word play in Shake speare’s early
efforts; acted and spoken (as by Betterton and Mrs. Bracegirdle in its
premiere), it would probably delight us with its</p>

<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>sparkle. (Says Witwoud, “I know a lady that loves talking so
incessantly, she won’t give an echo fair play.” 22 ) The plot is too
complicated; we grudge the time required to understand the schemes and
quarrels of frivolous nonentities; and the denouement is unmitigated
absurdity. But there is here a refinement of language and humor, a
subtlety (though never a profundity) of thought, that can please the
unhurried mind; no rough burlesque as in Vanbrugh, but such polite and
graceful persiflage as had trickled down from Versailles to Whitehall
and the Restoration court. And there is characterization. The hero,
Mirabell, is an unattractive but lifelike legacy- hunter; it is
remarkable that he seeks to marry Millamant, instead of seducing her —
but she had a fortune worth a dozen adulteries. She is Congreve’s
liveliest creation, the flirt who wants a thousand lovers and</p>

<p>Congreve himself sampled many surfaces, preferring texture to
substance and variety to unity. He never married, but serviced a
succession of</p>
<p>actresses. We hear of no children troubling or delighting him. He was
a pleasant companion in coffeehouses and clubs, and was received into

<p>best families. He ate well, and had his feet regularly blistered and
anointed for the gout. When Voltaire visited him in 1726 Congreve
deprecated the Frenchman’s praise of his plays, brushed them aside as
forgotten trifles, and asked Voltaire to consider him merely as a
gentleman. “If you had been merely a gentleman,” said Voltaire
(according to Voltaire), “I should not have come to see you.” 24</p>
<p>In 1728, on a journey to take the waters at Bath, Congreve’s
carriage</p>
<p>Long before Congreve’s death the English theater had begun to cleanse
itself. William III ordered the Master of the Revels to exercise with
greater severity his power to license or prohibit plays, and a revulsion
of public opinion supported this censorship. A law of Queen Anne forbade
the wear- ing of masks in the theater, and women, denied this disguise,
boycotted plays that were not of assured decency. 28 Swift agreed with
the bishops in condemning the London stage as a blot upon the English
character. Steele offered his Conscious Lovers (1722) as moral drama,
and Addison rivaled the dignity of French tragedy in his Cato (1713). An
earlier sign of the change was the tone of Dryden’s answer to Collier.
He felt that the divine had often condemned the dramatists unfairly, and
had “in many places . . . interpreted my words into blasphemy and
bawdry, of which they were not guilty.” But he added:</p>
<p>I shall say the less of Mr. Collier, because in many things he has
taxed me justly, and I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and
expressions of mine which can be truly argued of obscenity, profaneness,
or im-</p>
<p>morality, and retract them. If he be my enemy, let him triumph;
if</p>
<p>he be my friend, as I have given him no personal occasion to be</p>
<p>otherwise, he will be glad of my repentance. 27</p>

<li>JOHN DRYDEN: 1631-1700</li>
</ol>
<p>His father was of the minor gentry, having a small estate in
North-</p>
<p>amptonshire. He was sent to Westminster School in London, where the
learned Richard Busby gave him, and his fellow student John Locke, much
Latin and discipline. There he earned a scholarship which enabled him
to</p>
<p>322</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>go to Trinity College, Cambridge. In the year (1654) in which he took
his degree his father died, and John, as the eldest of fourteen
children, inherited the estate, which brought him sixty pounds a year.
He moved to London, and tried to eke this out with poetry. In 1659 he
published “Heroic</p>
<p>Stanzas” to the memory of Cromwell — verses remarkably jejune for a
man of twenty-nine. Dryden matured slowly, like a man climbing
laboriously over a hundred obstacles to successively higher ledges of
income. A year later he welcomed the Restoration in “Astraea Redux,”
which compared</p>
<p>But Charles was interested in the theater rather than mere poetry; so
the dramatists made money while the new poets languished. Dryden felt no
flair for drama, but he longed for regular bread. He tried his hand at
comedy, with a result (The Wild Gallant, 1663) which Pepys damned as “so
poor a thing as ever I saw in my life almost.” 28 On December 1, 1663,
Dryden married Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the Earl of Berkshire.
Eyebrows had risen at a lady marrying a poet, but she was twenty-five
and in danger of desiccation, and her brother Sir Robert Howard, itching
with authorship, had secured Dry den’s collaboration i n a play, The
Indian Queen, which they produced in 1664 with lavish scenery and great
success.</p>
<p>This tragedy made literary history by abandoning the blank verse of
the Elizabethans and using as its regular medium rhymed couplets of
pentameter lines. Lord Orrery had been impressed by the melody of rhyme
in French tragedy, and had introduced the style in his own plays. Dryden
returned to blank verse after 1675, recognizing that rhyme tends to
obstruct the flow of speech and thought. He would diave been a greater
poet had he had less facility in verse.</p>
<p>He followed up his co-operative success with an independent continua-
tion, The Indian Emperor (1665), whose hero was Montezuma. He was just
finding a place on the English stage when the plague closed the London
theaters for a year. When the plague and the fire had passed he
celebrated England’s re -emergence under the triple ordeal of these and
war in Annus Mirabilis (1 666), a poem of 304 quatrains, alternating
between vigorous description (stanzas 212-82) and juvenile inanity
(e.g., stanza 29). When the theaters reopened in 1666 Dryden hurried
back to drama, and till 1681 he produced nothing but plays. His
tragedies run to bombast, but they seemed to his contemporaries superi
or to Shakespeare’s; 29 and when he joined Davenant in remodeling The
Tempest the result was by the common consent of the collaborators a
great improvement on the original. The King’s Company may have agreed
with them, for it gave Dryden a</p>
<p>commission to supply it with three plays annually in return for a
shaqe in</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>the profits, which came to some £350 a year. Dryden’s comedies,
though as obscene as any, had less success than his twenty-seven
tragedies, for in these he caught the public interest in the New World
and its wonderful savages. So in The Conquest of Granada Almanzor
says:</p>
<p>I am as free as Nature first made man,</p>
<p>Ere the base law of servitude began,</p>
<p>When wild in woods the noble savage ran.</p>
<p>Probably it was the success of this play, and the luscious eulogies
of Charles II in Annus Mirabilis, that in 1670 won Dry den the post of
royal historio- grapher and poet laureate. His income now averaged a
thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>In the epilogue to Part II of The Conquest of Granada Dry den claimed
superiority for the Restoration drama over the Elizabethan. His
competitors, while appreciating the compliment, thought that too much of
its charity began at home. The wits of the town did not share the taste
of the audiences for the extravagant heroics of Dryden’s tragedies. The
Duke of Bucking - ham, with some collaborators, issued in 1671 a
rollicking satire, The Rehearsal, which made great fun of the
improbabilities, absurdities, and bombast of co ntemporary tragedies,
especially Dryden’s. The poet felt the sting, but nursed his revenge for
ten years; then he pilloried Buckingham as Zimri in the strongest lines
of Absalom and Achitophel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his study of Shakespeare had improved his art. In his
finest tragedy, All for Love (1678), he turned from Racine and rhyme to
Shake- speare and blank verse, put all his skill into rivaling the
Elizabethan on common ground, and told again the story of Antony and
Cleopatra losing the world for a liais on. If the earlier play did not
exist, Dryden’s might be better praised. Now and then it rises in stark
simplicity of speech to noble feeling tensely contained, as in Octavia’s
coming to Antony with Octavian’s offer of pardon. 30 Dryden’s play is
more c ompact, aiming to observe the unities; but by narrowing the
action to one crisis in one place and three days he reduced the heroic
theme to an amour, and lost the large perspective that in Antony and
Cleopatra saw this romance as part of events that shook and shaped the
Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>Today the most interesting aspects of Dryden’s dramas are the
prefaces with which he introduced them in print, and the essays in which
he ex- pounded his views on dramatic art. Corneille had given him the
example, but Dryden made the form a vehicle of splendid prose. As we
skim through these brief treatises and lively dialogues, we perceive
that the age of creation in English literature was passing into that age
of criticism which would culminate in Pope. But also our respect for
Dryden’s mind rises as we see</p>
<p>324 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>him probing urbanely into the technique of the drama and the art of
poetry, and comparing, with considerable penetration, the French with
the English stage. In these essays the picturesque rambling of
Elizabethan prose, the turgid and cumulative sentences of Milton, make
way for a simpler, smoother, more orderly diction freed from Latin
constructions, and im- proved by acquaintance with French literature;
never quite rivaling French elegance, but transmitting to the eighteenth
century — the century of prose — models of clear and graceful speech,
flowing and charming, natural and strong. Here the English essay took
form, and the classic age of English literature began.</p>
<p>But if Dryden’s essays now seem superior to the plays that gave them
cause, it was in satire that he dominated and almost terrorized his
time. Perhaps an accident released his sting. In 1679 John Sheffield,
Earl of Mulgrave, circulated in manuscript an anonymous Essay on Satire,
which attacked the Earl of Rochester, the Duchess of Portsmouth (Louise
de Keroualle), and in general the court of Charles II. Dryden, who
now</p>
<p>derived much of his income from the King, was mistakenly supposed to
be the author. On the night of December 1 8, in Rose Alley, Covent
Garden, he was attacked and cudgeled by a band of ruffians presumably,
but not certainly, in the hire of Rochester. Dryden was a man of good
nature and generosity, ready to help and praise; but his success, his
egotism, and his controversial affirmations had earned him many enemies.
For a time he bore their attacks without public reply; eve n the “Rose
Alley ambuscade” brought no direct response from his pen. But in 1681 he
gathered several of his foes into one caldron, and boiled them in the
most lethal satire in the English language.</p>
<p>It was the year in which Shaftesbury tried to organize a revolution
to replace Charles II with Charles’s bastard son; and when Part I of
Absalom and Achitophel appeared (November), Shaftesbury was about to be
tried for treason. Dryden’s satire took the side of the King, and may
have been suggested by the King. 31 He ridiculed Shaftesbury as
Achitophel, who persuades Absalom (the Duke of Monmouth) to revolt
against his father, David (Charles). And as both David and Charles loved
plurally, the poem begins with an essay on the value of polygamy:</p>
<p>In pious times, ere priestcraft did begin,</p>
<p>Before polygamy was made a sin,</p>
<p>When man on many multiplied his kind,</p>
<p>Ere one to one was cursedly confined,</p>
<p>When nature prompted and no law denied</p>
<p>Promiscuous use of concubine and bride,</p>
<p>When Israel’s monarch after Heaven’s own heart</p>

<p>To wives and slaves, and, wide as his command,</p>
<p>Scattered his Maker’s image through the land . . .</p>
<p>David rejoices in the beauty of his Absalom; Monmouth was, till the
revolt, the apple of the Merrie Monarch’s eye. And the Jews are the
English,</p>
<p>a headstrong, moody, murmuring race</p>
<p>As ever tried th’ extent and stretch of grace;</p>
<p>God’s pampered people, whom, debauched with ease,</p>

<p>Of these the false Achitophel was first,</p>

<p>A fiery soul, which, working out its way,</p>

<p>Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking. . . .</p>

<p>In squandering wealth was his peculiar art;</p>
<p>Nothing went unrewarded but desert;</p>
<p>Beggared by fools, whom still he found 〔out〕 too late,</p>
<p>He had his jest, and they had his estate. 34</p>
<p>England had never known satire as merciless as this,
concentrating</p>
<p>mayhem in a line, and leaving quartered corpses on every page. The
poem sold by the hundreds outside the very court in which Shaftesbury
was being tried for his life. Shaftesbury was acquitted; his Whig
partisans struck a medal in his honor; and a dozen poets and
pamphleteers, led by Thomas Shadwell, issued triumphant replies to the
man who, they were sure, had sold his wit and caustic to the King.
Dryden came back with another satire, The Medal (March, 1682), and
Shadwell was flayed with a special flail, MacFlecknoe (October). Here
the invective was coarser, descending at times to verbal abuse
undistinguished by such cutting couplets as had spread their bane with
such precision and economy in the earlier satire.</p>
<p>Our taste for literary slaughter of this sort has declined; after
centuries of argument we suspect that there is some truth in every
passion, some- thing to be loved in every foe. But even today politics
is war by other means; much more so then, when the Stuart throne swung
on the hinge of revolution, and to emerge on the losing side might well
mean death. In any case, Dryden had shown his mettle; he had earned the
gratitude of the King and of the Duke of York; and no one now questioned
his pre-eminence in the realms of’ rhyme. When he came to Will’s Tavern
a chair was re - served for him near the hearth in winter, on the
balcony in summer; there Pepys saw him, and heard “very witty and
pleasant discourse.” 35 Sir Walter Scott, with creative imagination,
pictured Dryden entering Will’s: “a little fat old man, with his own
gray hair, and in a full trimmed black suit that sat close as a glove,”
and “with the pleasantest smile I ever saw.” 36 “To bow to the Laureate,
and to hear his opinion of Racine’s last tragedy . . . , was thought a
privilege. A pinch from his snuffbox was an honor sufficient to turn the
head of a young enthusiast.” 37 He could be the soul of kind - ness to
friends, but fell too readily into personal abuse about rivals and
enemies; 38 and he allowed no one to exceed him in praise of his own
poetry. His adulation of the King, of Lady Castlemaine, and of those who
paid him for dedications surpassed the customary servility of his
profession in his time. 39 Yet Congreve repaid Dryden’s encouragement by
describing him as “exceedingly humane and compassionate, ready to
forgive injuries, and capable of a sincere reconciliation with those
that had offen ded him.” 40</p>
<p>Entering now upon his physical decline, he began to think more kindly
of religion than in the proud vigor of his middle years. His dramas and
satires had taken incidental flings at divers creeds; now, having cast
in his</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT 327</p>
<p>lot with the Tories, he turned to the Anglican Church as a pillar
of</p>
<p>England’s stability, and deprecated the insolence of reason invading
the sanctuaries of faith. In November, 1682, he astonished his worldly
friends by issuing Religio Laid, a poem in defense of the Established
Church. An inspired Bible, even an infallible Church to interpret and
supplement it, seemed to him indispensable supports of society and
sanity. He was acquainted with the contentions of the deists; his answer
was that their doubts were foolishly disturbing that difficult social
order which only a moral code sanctioned by religion can sustain:</p>
<p>For points obscure are of small use to learn.</p>
<p>But common quiet is the world’s concern.</p>
<p>The argument could serve the Roman Church too, and Dryden followed it
to its conclusion by accepting conversion to Catholicism (1686).</p>
<p>Whether the accession of a Catholic King the year before, and anxiety
for the continuance of his pensions, 41 had anything to do with the
conversion we cannot say. In any case Dryden gave his full poetic art to
expounding the Catholic view in The Hind, and the Panther (1687), in
which a “milk - white hind” defends the Roman faith against a panther,
“fairest creature of the spotted kind,” representing the Anglicans. The
picture of two four - footed beasts debating the Real Presence of Christ
in the Eucharist 42 lent it- self to ridicule, which was soon supplied
by Matthew Prior and Lord Halifax in a parody entitled The Hind and the
Panther Transversed to the Story of the Country Mouse and the City Mouse
(1687).</p>
<p>In 1688 James II fled to France, and Dryden found himself living
again under a Protestant King. He kept to his new faith; all his three
sons had employment in Rome under the Pope, and another change of key
would have been cacophonous. He bore with courage the loss of his
laureateship, his pension, and his post as historiographer; history,
however, sharpened his sorrow by giving these honors to the Shadwell
whom Dryden had crowned as King of Nonsense and paragon of stupidity. He
returned in old age to supporting himself by his pen. He wrote more
plays, translated selections from Theocritus, Lucretius, Horace, Ovid,
and Persius, made a loose but fluent rendering of the Aeneid into heroic
verse, and transformed into his own meters some “fables” of Homer, Ovid,
Boccaccio, and Chaucer. In 1697, aged sixty- seven, he composed a
celebrated ode, “Alexander’s Feast,” which has been too highly
praised.</p>
<p>He died May 1, 1700. Much confusion attended his funeral, rival
factions contesting for his corpse; but finally he was laid to rest
beside Chaucer in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>It is difficult to love him. To all appearances he was an
opportunist</p>

<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>trimmer, who praised Cromwell’s memory under the Protectorate,
praised Charles and his mistresses; praised Protestantism under a
Protestant King and Catholicism under a Catholic, and courted pensions
with all his melody. He made so many enemies that there must have been
something unlovable in him. He rivaled all his competitors in the
licentiousness of his plays and the piety of his verse. His power of
satire was so great as to evoke our sympathies for his victims as for
martyrs burning at the stake. But he was without question the greatest
English poet of his generation. Much of his poetry was written to the
occasion, and time seldom preserves what was addressed to the time. But
his satires still live, for no one has equaled them in etching
characters in acid scorn. He developed the heroic couplet to such
compactness and flexibility that it dominated English poetry for a
century. His influence was better in prose: he cleared it of cumbersome
involutions and alien idioms, and disciplined it to a classic clarity
and ease. His contemporaries were right: they feared rather than loved
him, but they knew that by the force of his will and the labor of his
art he had won the right to preside over them as the arbiter of letters
and the sovereign of rhyme. He was the Jonson and Johnson of his
age.</p>

<li>A CATALOGUE</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us gather into a lifeless catalogue some minor figures who gave
life and literature to this epoch, but with whom we cannot stay long
enough to see them live.</p>
<p>The greatest poem of the pagan Restoration was a Puritan epic, but
the most famous poem was an anti-Puritan mock epic, Hudibras (1663-78).
Samuel Butler, as a lusty youth, spent uncomfortable years in the
service of Sir Samuel Luke, an ardent Presbyterian colonel in Cromwell’s
army, stationed at Cople Hoo, a citadel of Puritan politics and prayer.
When the Restoration came Butler revenged himself by publishing a
rollicking satire in which Sir Hudibras, the chivalric knight, leads his
squire, Ralpho, on a crusade against sin. From the beginning you may
judge the whole:</p>
<p>When civil dudgeon first grew high,</p>
<p>And men fell out, they knew not why;</p>
<p>When hard words, jealousies, and fears</p>
<p>Set folks together by the ears,</p>
<p>And made them fight, like mad or drunk,</p>
<p>For Dame Religion as for punk; …</p>
<p>When Gospel-trumpeter, surrounded</p>
<p>With long-eared rout, to battle sounded,</p>
<p>And pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,</p>

<p>3*9</p>
<p>Was beat with fist instead of stick:</p>
<p>Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling,</p>
<p>And out he rode a-colonelling. . . .</p>
<p>For ’t has been held by many that</p>
<p>As Montaigne, playing with his cat,</p>
<p>Complains she thought him but an ass,</p>
<p>Much more she would Sir Hudibras . . .</p>
<p>We grant, although he had much wit,</p>
<p>H’was very shy of using it,</p>
<p>As being loath to wear it out,</p>
<p>And therefore bore it not about</p>
<p>Unless on holidays or sd,</p>
<p>As men their best apparel do. . . .</p>
<p>For his religion, it was fit</p>
<p>To match his learning and his wit;</p>
<p>’Twas Presbyterian true blue,</p>
<p>For he was of that stubborn crew</p>
<p>Of errant saints, whom all men grant</p>
<p>To be the true Church Militant:</p>
<p>Such as do build their faith upon</p>
<p>The holy text of pike and gun,</p>
<p>Decide all controversies by</p>
<p>Infallible artillery,</p>
<p>And prove their doctrine orthodox</p>
<p>By Apostolic blows and knocks; . . .</p>
<p>A sect whose chief devotion lies</p>
<p>In odd perverse antipathies; . . .</p>
<p>That with more care keep holiday</p>
<p>The wrong than others the right way;</p>
<p>Compound for sins they are inclined to</p>
<p>By damning those they have no mind to. 43</p>
<p>And so on, to the pain of the Puritans and the delight of the King.
Charles rewarded the author with three hundred pounds. Every royalist
praised it except Pepys, who could not “see where the wit lies,” though
“the book 〔is〕 now in the greatest fashion for drollery.” 44 Butler
hurried to bring out continuations (1664, 1678), but he had no further
arrows in his quiver, and had run out of rhymes. The strife of
Protestant and Catholic replaced that of royalist and Puritan; Butler
was forgotten, and died in obscure poverty (1680). Forty years later a
monument was erected to him in Westminster Abbey. “He asked for bread,”
said an epigram, “and he received a stone.” 45</p>
<p>Better than such rhyme-chasing doggerel was the stately prose of</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion, which appeared in 1702-4,
though written in 1646- 74. Men could see, in Queen Anne’s reign, how
careful had been the composition of those eight volumes, how splendid
their style, how penetrating those sketches of character, how
magnanimous had been the spirit of the old beaten Chancellor. Gilbert
Burnet, likewise, had played no small part in The History of His Own
Time, which by his order was published (1724) only after his death. His
History of the Reformation of the Church of England (1679, 1681, 1715)
was a more substantial work, a labor of long research; it came at a time
when Protestant England feared a Catholic revival; both houses of
Parliament thanked him for it. Enemies and editors have found a thousand
errors in it; it is still warm with partisan- ship, and occasionally
sullied with invective; but it remains the greatest book on its theme.
Burnet strove to widen religious toleration, and earned the hostility of
the mob.</p>
<p>Three other men sought to enlarge the present with the past. Thomas
Fuller, passing through his loved land county by county, collected his
History of the Worthies of England (1662), enlivening his dead heros
with anecdotes, epigrams, and wit. Anthony Wood told the history of
Oxford, and compiled a biographical dictionary of its graduates —
careful works from which many an author has nibbled stealthily. John
Aubrey gathered juicy fragments about 426 English notables, hoping to
co-ordinate the material into a history, but laziness and death
prevented him, and his Minutes of Lives saw print only in 1813 ; 46 his
relics have cheered us on our way. Colonel John Hutchinson, a Puritan
gentleman, voted for the execution of Charles I, was imprisoned by
Charles II, was released, died soon afterward, and was enshrined by his
widow, Lucy, in a loving and illuminat- ing Life of Colonel Hutchinson;
but Lucy suffered from delayed periods, her sentences sometimes running
through a page. John Arbuthnot, able physician and loyal friend of
Swift, Pope, Queen Anne, and many others, joined in the Tory campaign to
stop the war with France, by issuing (1712) a series of pamphlets
satirizing the Whigs, and describing an imaginary character, John Bull,
who became thenceforth a symbol of England. John, wrote John, was</p>
<p>an honest, plain-dealing fellow, choleric, bold, and of a very
inconstant temper. … If you flattered him you might lead him like a
child.</p>
<p>John’s temper depended very much upon the air; his spirits rose and
fell with the weather-glass. John was quick and understood his business
very well; but no man alive was more careless in looking into his</p>
<p>accounts, or more cheated by partners, apprentices, or servants. This
was occasioned by his being a boon companion, loving his bottle and his
diversion; for to say truth, no man kept a better house than John, nor
spent his money more generously. 47</p>

<p>What would Sir William Temple say if he could find himself reduced to
a paragraph in a chapter culminating in his secretary? Perhaps he would
say, if his fine manners would permit, that historians neglected him
because he had not kept two women dangling on the edge of matrimony till
the death of one and the exhaustion of the other; that he had not sold
his pen to Tory ministers out of pique at Whigs, nor dipped it in acid
against mankind; but had served his country quietly in successful
diplomacy, and, in an age of corruption and licentiousness, had given
England an unostentatious example of decent family life. For seven years
he courted Dorothy Osborne, whose lively letters to him became a part of
English literature; 48 she accepted him despite the opposition of both
their families; and he married her after an attack of smallpox had
destroyed her beauty. He entered politics, but preferred tasks that took
him far away from the fever of London; and he avoided “that laborious,
that invidious, that closely watched slavery which is mocked with the
nam e of power.” 49 He was among the first to warn against the
territorial ambitions of Louis XIV, and he was the chief architect of
the Triple Alliance that checked the French King in 1668. In 1674 and
1677 he was offered the secretaryship of state, but he preferred his
diplomatic post at The Hague. His farseeing negotiations brought about
the marriage of Mary, daughter of James II, to the future William III,
which made possible the “Glorious Revolution.” In 1681 he retired from
politics to a life of studying and writing at Moor Park, his estate in
Surrey. Swift thought him cold and reserved, but Sir William’s wife and
sister alike worshiped him as the heart of kindness and courtesy. The
most famous of his essays, Of Ancient and Modern Learning (1690), lauded
the</p>
<p>ancients, and belittled modem science and philosophy in the very
teeth of Newton, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Locke. Bentley caught him
in a famous error. Sir William retreated into his garden, and comforted
himself with Epicurus. We shall meet him again.</p>

<p>time he oscillated between France and England; finally, the Civil War
over, he returned to his home (February 6, 1652). He paid Cromwell’s
government to leave him alone. He corresponded with the exiled Charles
II, and in 1659 he labored to promote the Restoration. After Charles had
reached the throne Evelyn was persona grata at the court, though he con-
demned its immorality. He filled some minor governmental posts, but for
the most part he preferred to plant trees and write thirty books at his
country home. He wrote on everything from Lucretius to Sabbatai Zevi.
His Fumifugium failed to clear the air of London, but his Sylva (1664)
pleaded effectively for the reforestation of England, and he spurred the
government to plant trees throughout London, whose trees are now its
greatest glory and delight. His Life of Mrs. Godolphin is an idyl of</p>
<p>womanly virtues amid the Restoration riot.</p>
<p>From 1641, when he was twenty-one, to February 3, 1706, twenty-four
days before his death, he kept a diary of what he saw or heard in
England or on the Continent. As a man of “quality” he could not afford
to record such sins and intimate views as lure us to Pepys’s longer
Diary; but his descriptions of European cities have helped us to see the
color of the time. He has some vivid pages, as on the Simplon Pass; 61
and sometimes he opens his heart in tender passages, as on the death of
his five-year-old son. His diary remained unpublished till 1818.</p>
<p>Its references to Samuel Pepys led to the examination of the six
volumes, in shorthand, that had been bequeathed by Pepys to Magdalene
College, Cambridge. After three years of labor the 3,012 pages were
deciphered; they were published in 1825, abbreviated and purified; now,
still incom- plete, they fill four thick tomes. They have made Pepys one
of the most intimately and erroneously known characters in history.
Intimately, be- cause his diary was obviously intended for only
posthumous publication if any, and therefore included details many of
which had to be kept secret in his lifetime, and some of which are still
“unprintable.” Erroneously, for the diary covers less than a decade
(January 1, 1660, to May 31, 1669) of Pepys’c life, and gives no
adequate account of his work at the Admiralty — the headquarters of the
English navy — where he served in more and more important capacities
from 1660 to 1689. Long after his death he was re- membered and honored
there as an able and industrious administrator.</p>
<p>His father was a London tailor, one of those younger sons of the
gentry who took to trade because the oldest son alone inherited the
estate. Samuel went to Cambridge on a scholarship, and took the
bachelor’s and master’s degrees with no other discount than a public
reprimand for having once been “scandalously overseene in drinking,” and
again for writing a ro - mance, Love is a Cheat, which he afterward
destroyed. At the age of twenty-two (1 655) he married Elizabeth
St. Michel, daughter of a Hugue-</p>

<p>335</p>
<p>not. In 1658 he was operated on for the stone; the affair went off
success- fully, and he gratefully celebrated its anniversary every
recorded year thereafter.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Montagu, his distant kinsman, made him his secretary ( 1
660) , and Samuel accompanied him when Montagu commanded the fleet that
brought Charles back from exile. Before that year was out, Pepys was ap-
pointed clerk of the acts in the navy office. He studied naval affairs
as sedulously as his pursuit of women would permit, and since his
superiors were also devoted to that ancient sport, he soon came to know
naval de- tails more fully than the admirals (Montagu and the Duke of
York) who depended on his information. During the war with the Dutch
(1665-67) he managed with notable competence the victualing of the
fleet, and during the plague he kept to his post after most governmental
officials had run away. When (1668) the navy office was attacked in
Parliament, Pepys was entrusted with the defense, and his three hours’
speech in the Com - mons won for the office an unmerited exoneration.
Pepys then drew up for the Duke of York two papers exposing the
incompetence of navy per- sonnel, and these papers played a part in the
reform of the fleet. He worked hard, usually rising at 4 a.m ., 52 but
he saw to it that his salary of £ 350 a year was aided by presents,
commissions, and other perquisites, some of which might now be called
bribes, but which in those amiable days were considered legitimate
amplifications. His own superior. Lord Mon- tagu, had explained to him
that “it was not the salary of any place that did make a man rich, but
the opportunity of getting money while he is in t he place.” 53</p>
<p>All of Pepys’s faults are revealed in the diary with a candor
unpretentious and relatively complete. Why he kept it so honestly is not
clear. He con- cealed it carefully during his life, and wrote it in his
own system of</p>
<p>shorthand, using 314 different characters, and made no arrangements
for its posthumous publication. Apparently he took pleasure in so
reviewing his daily activities, his physiological disturbances, his
marital quarrels, his flirtations and adulteries; he could, on secretly
rereading the record, find the same clandestine satisfaction that we
derive from looking at ourselves in the mirror. He tells us how he had
his wife cut his hair, and “found in my head and body about twenty lice,
. . . more than I have had, I believe, these twenty years.” 54 He
learned to love his wife, but only after many quarrels, some that
“vexed” him “to the guts”; often, on his own telling, he was mean to
her; on one occasion he “pulled her by the nose”; 55 on another “I did
strike her over her left eye such a blow as the poor wretch</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>mour. He returned home for dinner, then sallied out, found “Bagwell’s
wife . . . and took her away to an alehouse, and there made I much of
her, and then away thence to another and endeavored to caress her, but
elle ne voulait pas, which did vex me.”</p>
<p>It is astonishing what energy the man had — every few months another
amour; he pursued women till they repulsed him with pins. 67 He con-
fessed the “strange slavery that I stand in to beauty.” 68 In
Westminster Abbey “I heard a sermon, and spent (God forgive me) most of
my time in looking at Mrs. Butler.” 69 He looked with especial longing,
almost with Use majeste, upon Lady Castlemaine; seeing her in Whitehall
Palace , “I glutted myself with looking at her.” 60 He had to content
himself with her petticoats hanging on a line; “it did me good to look
upon them”; 61 and “so home to supper and to bed, fancying myself to
sport with Mrs. Stewart 〔Lady Castlemaine〕 with great pleasure.” 62
But his taste was not confined to court beauties. A neighbor,
Mrs. Diana, passed his door; he drew her “into my house upstairs, and
there did dally with her a great while.” 63 He took a Mrs. Lane to
Lambeth, but, “after being tired of her company,” he resolved “never to
do so again while I live.” 64 On one oc - casion his wife caught him
hugging a girl; she threatened to leave him; he appeased her with vows,
and rushed off to his latest mistress. He seduced his wife’s maid,
Deborah Willet; he loved to have her comb his hair; but his wife came
upon him during his explorations; he made new vows; Deborah was
dismissed; Pepys visited her as part of his day’s work.</p>
<p>His lust continued even when his eyesight failed. His habit of
reading and writing by candlelight began in 1664 to impair his vision.
But in the critical years that followed he worked especially hard,
despite the progress of his trouble. On May 31, 1669, he made the last
entry in his diary:</p>
<p>And thus ends all that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my own
eyes in the keeping of my Journal. . . . Whatever comes of it, I
must</p>
<p>forbear; and therefore resolve, from this time forward, to have
it</p>
<p>kept by my people in longhand, and must therefore be contented to set
down no more than is fit for them and all the world to know; or, if
there be anything — which cannot be much, now my amours with Deborah are
past, and my eyes hindering me in almost all other</p>
<p>pleasures — I must endeavor to keep a margin in my book open, to</p>
<p>add, here and there, a note in shorthand with my own hand. And</p>
<p>so I betake myself to that course, which is almost as much as to
see</p>
<p>myself go into my grave; for which, and all the discomforts that
will</p>
<p>accompany my being blind, the good God prepare me! — S.P.</p>
<p>He had thirty-four years of life remaining to him. He nursed
carefully what remained of his eyesight, and he never went completely
blind. The</p>

<p>Duke and the King gave him a long leave of absence; then he returned
to work. In 1673 he was made secretary of the Admiralty. Meanwhile his
wife became a Catholic. When the Popish Plot broke upon England Pepys
was arrested and sent to the Tower (May 22, 1679) on suspicion of having
had a hand in the murder of Godfrey. He disproved the charge and was
released after nine months’ imprisonment. He remained out of office till
1684; then he was again appointed secretary of the Admiralty, and con-
tinued the reform of the navy. When his master became James II Pepys was
in effect head of naval administration. But when James fled to France
Pepys was imprisoned again. Soon released, he lived his final fourteen
years in retirement as “the Nestor of the navy.” He died May 26, 1703,
aged seventy, full of honors and washed of sin.</p>
<p>Many things in the man were likable. We have noted his love of music.
He pursued science too, experimented in physics, became a member of the
Royal Society, was elected its president in 1684. He was as vain as a
man, he took bribes, he beat his servant till his arm hurt, 05 he was
cruel to his wife, and he was an arrant rake. But what royal and ducal
exemplars he had, more shameless far than he! And which of us would have
a spotless fame if he left so honest a diary?</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>DANIEL DEFOE: 1659?-! 73 I</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the women who escaped Pepys deserves a cautious curtsy here as
the mother of the Restoration novel, and the first Englishwoman to live
by her pen. Aphra Behn was remarkable in a dozen ways. Bom in England,
brought up in South America, she returned to England at the age of</p>
<p>eighteen (1658), married a London merchant of Dutch descent,
impressed Charles II by her shrewdness and wit, was sent on secret
service to the Netherlands, accomplished her missions with skill, but
was so meagerly paid that she took to writing as a means of support. She
composed comedies, as obscene and successful as any. In 1678 she
published Oroonoko, the story of a Negro “royal slave” and his beloved
Imoinda. It was an original blend of realism and romance. The way was
open for Robinson Crusoe, and for the romantic novel.</p>
<p>Defoe too lived by his pen, and it was one of the most versatile
in</p>
<p>history. His father was James Foe, a London butcher of strong
Presbyterian doctrine. Daniel was expected to become a preacher, but he
preferred marriage, business, and politics. He begot seven children,
became a whole- sale hosier, joined Monmouth’s army in rebellion (1685),
and William’s army in overthrowing James II. In 1692 he went bankrupt,
owing £ 17,000; later he paid his creditors almost in full. While making
and losing money</p>
<p>336</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>he issued pamphlets on a variety of subjects, and containing an
astonishing wealth of original thought. His Essay on Projects (1698)
offered practical suggestions, much in advance of his time, on banking,
insurance, roads, lunatic asylums, military colleges, the higher
education of women. He moved to Tilbury, where he became secretary, then
manager, then owner, of a tile factory. Introduced to William III, he
was appointed to a minor post in the government, and supported the
King’s war policy so vigorously that he was accused of being more Dutch
than English. He defended him- self in a vigorous poem, The True-born
Englishman (1701), reminding the English that the whole nation was of
mixed origin and blood. Himself a Dissenter, he issued in 1702 an
anonymous tract, The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, in which,
anticipating Swift’s method of stultification by exaggeration, he
ridiculed the Anglican persecution of Dissent by recom- mending that
every Dissenter who preached should be hanged, and every Dissenter who
listened should be driven from England. He was arrested (February,
1703), fined, jailed, and condemned to the pillory. He was released in
November, but meanwhile his tile business had gone to ruin.</p>
<p>The man who secured his release was Robert Harley, secretary of
state. Harley recognized Defoe’s ability as a journalist; apparently he
struck a bargain with him for the services of his pen, and for the
remainder of Anne’s reign Defoe was in the employ of the government.
Soon after his release he started a triweekly four-page periodical, The
Review, which ran till 1713 and was almost entirely written by
Defoe.</p>
<p>In 1704-5 he rode horseback through England as an election agent for
Harley; en courant he picked up the data for his Tour through England
and Wales. In 1706-7 he served Harley and Godolphin as a spy in Scot-
land. His powerful pamphlets won him many readers, but also many
enemies. He was arrested again in 1713 and in 1715; and again he earned
release by promising to put his pen at the service of the
government.</p>
<p>He was full of literary devices. In 1715 he published tracts
allegedly</p>
<p>written by a Quaker, and in the same year The Wars of Charles XII as
reported by “a Scots Gentleman in the Swedish Service.” In 1717 he
issued letters supposedly by a Turk, ridiculing Christian intolerance;
to a maga- zine well called Mist he contributed material signed by
fictitious corre- spondents; rarely did he write as Defoe. To this skill
in impersonation he added a wide reading in geography, especially of
Africa and the Americas. He was apparently fascinated by William
Dampier’s New V oyage round the World (1697). On one of Dampier’s
voyages his galley, the Cinque Ports, put in at Juan Fernandez Islands,
some four hundred miles west of Chile. A Scottish sailing master,
Alexander Selkirk, having quarreled with his captain, asked to be left
on one of the three islands, with a few neces- saries. He remained alone
there for four years, when he was taken back to</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>England. He told his story to Richard Steele, who reported it in
The</p>
<p>Englishman for December 3, 1713. He told it also to Defoe, and
claimed- to have given Defoe a written record of his adventure in
solitude. 86 Defoe transformed the account into literature, and
published in 1719 the most famous of English novels.</p>
<p>The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe caught
the imagination of England, running through four editions in four
months. Here was a new conception of adventure and conflict — not of man
against man, nor of civilized man amid savages, but of man against
nature, of man alone, frankly afraid, unaided till “Friday” came,
building a life out of nature’s raw materials; this was the history of
civilizati on in one volume and one man. Many readers took it as
history, for seldom in all literature had a story been told with such
verisimilitude of circumstantial detail. Defoe’s training in literary
deception had lifted him out of journalism into art.</p>
<p>He lived now in moderate affluence in London, but he did not abate
his unparalleled productivity. While still sending forth pamphlets, he
turned out full-length books as if they were novelettes. In 1720 he
published Serious Reflections during the Life and Surprizing Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe; The Life and Adventures of Mrs. Duncan Campbell (a
deaf-and- dumb conjurer); a month later The Memoirs of a Cavalier, so
ben trovato that the elder Pitt took it for history; and another month
later The Life, Adventures, Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton,
which contained astonishing anticipations of discoveries in Africa. In
1722 he issued The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders, and A
Journal of the Plague Year, and The History of Colonel Jacque, and The
Religious Courtship, and The Impartial History of Peter Alexoivitz, the
Present Czar of</p>
<p>Muscovy — his second anticipation of Voltaire’s biographies. These
sub - stantial volumes were intended as potboilers to provide food for
his family; but , by the man’s power of imagination and fluency of
style, they became</p>
<p>The year 1724 was slightly less astonishing: Defoe published one of
his major novels, The Fortunate Mistress, now known as Roxana ; the
first of two volumes reporting his Tour through the Whole Island of
Great Britain; and a Life of John Sheppard, purporting to be a
manuscript handed to a friend by Sheppard just before his execution.
This was one of several short lives that Defoe wrote of famous
criminals. One of these biographies, The Highland Rogue (1724), prepared
for Scott’s Rob Roy; another,</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>An Account of Jonathan Wild (1725), prepared for Fielding. Any popu-
lar topic drew ink from Defoe’s well and pounds from his publishers:
Political History of the Devil (1726), The Mysteries of Magic
(1720),</p>
<p>Secrets of the Invisible World Discovered, or History and Reality of
Appa- ritions (1727-28). Add to these a poem in twelve books, Jure
Divino, defending every man’s natural rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. Amid so many breadwinning condescensions to
popular taste and fancies were honest contributions to serious thought:
so in The Com- plete English Tradesman (1725-27), and A Plan of the
English Com-</p>
<p>merce (1728), and the unfinished Complete English Gentleman, he
offered useful information and practical advice, not always geared to
Gospel morality.</p>
<p>We cannot recommend his literary morals, but we can admire his in-
dustry. Probably never since Rameses II’s 150 children has history seen
such a prodigy of progeny. The only thing incredible in Defoe is that he
wrote all that he wrote. For we marvel, too, at the quality of Defoe’s
mind, in which imagination and memory, harnessed to hard labor, pro-
duced the most plausible unrealities in literature. We recognize the
genius and courage of a man who, in such a mass and haste of work, could
main- tain so high a level of matter and style. In all his 210 volumes
(if we may speak from hearsay) there is hardly one dull page; and where
Defoe is dull he is deliberately so, to add to the verisimilitude of his
tale. No one has surpassed him in direct and simple narrative,
convincingly natural. Here his haste was his fortune: he had no time for
ornament; his journalistic training and bent compelled him to brevity
and clarity. He was by all means the greatest journalist of his time,
though that included Steele and Addison and Swift; his Review plowed the
furrow in which T he Spectator planted choicer seed. That was
distinction enough; but add to it the cosmic and living popularity of
Robinson Crusoe, and the influence it had upon novels of adventure, even
upon a story so differently motivated as Travels … by Lemuel Gulliver.
Barring the author of that brilliant indictment of mankind, Defoe was
the greatest genius of English letters in that abound- ing age.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>STEELE AND ADDISON</li>

<p>“Dick” Steele, more than anyone else, marks the literary transition
from the Restoration to Queen Anne. His youth had all the qualities of a
Restor- ation roisterer: born in Dublin, son of a notary; educated at
Charterhouse School and Oxford; impressionable, excitable, generous;
instead of taking his degree he joined the government army in Ireland.
He drank like a</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>sieve, fought a duel, and nearly killed his antagonist. The
experience sobered him transiently; he began a campaign against dueling,
and wrote an essay, The Christian Hero (1701), in which he argued that a
man might be a gentleman while remaining a Christian. He described the
corruption of the age, called his readers back to the Bible as the
source of true faith and pure morality, and appealed to men to respect
the charm and chastity of women.</p>
<p>He was now twenty-nine years old. Finding that even the middle class,
to which he belonged, looked upon him as a tiresome preacher, he decided
to put his message into plays. He applauded Jeremy Collier’s
denunciation of theatrical obscenity, and in a succession of comedies he
championed virtue and punished his villains decisively. These
productions were failures. They contained some lively scenes and wit,
but the audiences were skepti- cal of his denouements, and demanded
entertainment at whatever cost to the Ten Commandments; while those
solid Londoners who might have seconded his sentiments were seldom seen
at the theater. How to reach these people?</p>
<p>He decided to try a medium that would find them in the coffeehouses.
On April 12, 1709, taking a leaf from Defoe’s Review, he issued the
first number of a triweekly periodical, The Tatler, editing it, and
writing most of it, under the pseudonym of Isaac Bickerstaff. He aimed
it at the coffee- houses by announcing:</p>
<p>All accounts of gallantry, pleasure, and entertainment shall be</p>
<p>under the article 〔be dated from〕 White’s chocolate house;
poetry,</p>
<p>under that of Will’s coffee -house; learning, under the title of
Grecian; foreign and domestic news you will have from St. James’s coffee
-</p>
<p>house; and what else I shall on any subject offer shall be dated from
my own apartment.</p>
<p>It was a clever scheme: it aroused the interest of the coffeehouse
fre- quenters, it took news and topics from the discussions there, and
it allowed Steele to express his views without interruption or dispute.
So, in Number 25 (June 7, 1709), he told of receiving a letter “from a
young lady . . . wherein she laments the misfortune of . . . her lover,
who was lately wounded in a duel”; and he went on to show the absurdity
of a custom by which an injured gentleman must invite the offender to
add murder to insult; for what does a challenge mean but:</p>
<p>“Sir, your extraordinary behaviour last night, and the liberty
you</p>
<p>were pleased to take with me, makes me this morning give you this, to
tell you, because you are an illbred puppy, I will meet you in Hyde
Park, an hour hence. … I desire you would come with a pistol in</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>your hand. . . . and endeavour to shoot me through the head, to teach
you more manners.”</p>
<p>Here was the voice of the middle class laughing at the aristocracy;
and it was chiefly the middle class that filled the coffeehouses.</p>
<p>In further essays Steele made fun of aristocratic luxury, expletives,
af- fectations, ornaments, and dress. He begged women to dress simply,
and to avoid jewelry: “The cluster of diamonds upon the breast can add
no beauty to the fair chest of ivory that supports it.” 88 His
tenderness for women rivaled his affection for alcohol. He insisted that
they had intelli- gence as well as texture, but he lauded most of all
their modesty and purity — qualities not recognized in Restoration
comedy. Of one woman he said that “to have loved her was a liberal
education” — which Thackeray con- sidered “the finest compliment to a
woman that perhaps ever was offered.” 69 Steele described with emotion
the joys of family life, the pleasant patter of children’s feet, the
gratitude of a husband to his aging wife:</p>
<p>She gives me every day pleasure beyond what I ever knew in the</p>
<p>possession of her beauty when I was in the vigour of youth. Every</p>
<p>moment of her life brings me fresh instances of her complacency to my
inclinations, and her prudence in regard to my fortune. Her face is to
me much more beautiful than when I first saw it; there is no decay in
any feature which I cannot trace from the very instant it was</p>
<p>occasioned by some anxious concern for my welfare and interests. . .
.</p>
<p>The love of a wife is as much above the idle passion commonly called
by that name, as the loud laughter of buffoons is inferior to the</p>
<p>elegant mirth of gentlemen. 70</p>
<p>When Steele wrote this he had been twice married. His letters to his
second wife are models of devotion, though they soon include excuses for
not coming home to dinner. He failed to be the good bourgeois that he
held up as the model of life. He drank too much, spent too much, bor-
rowed too much. He walked in side streets to avoid the friends who had
lent him money; he went in hiding to elude his creditors; finally he was
jailed for debt. Readers of The Toiler contrasted his preaching with his
practice. John Dennis issued an unfeeling satire on Steele’s sentiments.
Subscribers fell away, and on January 2, 1711, The Tatler expired. Its
place in the history of English literature remains, for in its pages the
new morality began to express itself, the short story took its modern
form, and Addison developed — as in The Spectator he would perfect — the
modern essay.</p>
<p>Addison and Steele, both born in 1672, had been friends since their
days together in Charterhouse School. Joseph’s father was an Anglican
minister.</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT 341</p>
<p>who gave him an inoculation of piety that resisted all Restoration
infec- tions. At Oxford his proficiency in Latin won him a scholarship.
At twenty- two his talents so impressed Halifax that the Earl persuaded
the head of Magdalen College to divert the youth from the ministry to
the service of the government. “I am called an enemy of the Church,”
said Halifax,</p>
<p>“but I will never do it any other injury than keeping Mr. Addison out
of it.” 71 As the prodigy in Latin was destitute of French, and a
knowledge of French was required of diplomats, Halifax secured for him
an annual pension of three hundred pounds to finance a stay on the
Continent. For two years Addison wandered leisurely through France,
Italy, and</p>
<p>Switzerland.</p>
<p>While he was in Geneva the accession of Anne removed his friends</p>
<p>from office and cut off his pension. Reduced to his own slender
income, he engaged himself as tutor to a young English traveler, and
with him toured Switzerland, Germany, and the United Provinces. This
employ- ment ending, he returned to London (1703), and for a time lived
in genteel poverty. But he was a magnet for good fortune. When
Marlborough won the battle of Blenheim (August 13, 1704), Godolphin,
lord treasurer, looked around for someone to celebrate the victory in
verse. Halifax recom- mended Addison; the scholar responded with a
resounding poem, The Campaign; it was published on the very day of
Marlborough’s triumphant entry into the capital, and its success helped
to reconcile England to con- tinuing the war. It was Addison’s highest
poetic flight, which George</p>
<p>Washington favored above all other poems. Hear the famous lines:</p>
<p>But, O my Muse! what numbers wilt thou find</p>
<p>To sing the furious troops in battle join’d?</p>
<p>Methinks I hear the drum’s tumultuous sound</p>
<p>The victor’s shouts and dying groans confound;</p>
<p>The dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies,</p>
<p>And all the thunder of the battle rise.</p>
<p>’Twas then great Marlborough’s mighty soul was proved,</p>
<p>That, in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,</p>
<p>Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,</p>
<p>Examined all the dreadful scenes of war:</p>
<p>In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,</p>
<p>To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,</p>
<p>Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,</p>
<p>And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.</p>
<p>So when an angel, by divine command,</p>
<p>With rising tempests shakes a guilty land</p>
<p>(Such as of late o’er pale Britannia passed),</p>
<p>Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;</p>
<p>And, pleased the Almighty’s orders to perform,</p>
<p>Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>That last line and angelic simile wafted Addison safely back into
gov- ernment pay, where he remained for the next ten years. In 1705 he
was appointed commissioner of appeals, replacing John Locke; in 1706 he
was undersecretary of state; in 1707 he was attached to the mission of
Halifax to Hanover, which prepared for the accession of that house to
the throne of England; in 1708 he took his seat in Parliament, and, by
virtue of his offices, held it till his death; in 1709 he became chief
secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In 17 11 he was affluent
enough to buy a ten- thousand-pound estate near Rugby.</p>
<p>In his prosperity he did not forget Steele. He chided his sins, got
him a place in the government, lent him considerable sums, and in one
case sued him for repayment. 72 When the anonymous Tatler appeared he
noticed in it a remark on Virgil which he had made to Steele; in “Isaac
Bickerstaff” he recognized his high-living, impecunious friend; and soon
he was con- tributing to the journal. In 1710 the Whigs fell, Steele
lost his govern- mental post, and Addison lost all his offices except as
commissioner of appeals. The Tatler celebrated the new year by expiring.
Steele and Addi- son pooled their misfortunes and hopes, and on March 1,
17 11, they sent forth the first number of the most famous periodical in
English literary</p>
<p>The Spectator appeared daily except Sunday, in a folded sheet of four
or six pages. Instead of dating the articles from various centers, the
anony- mous editor invented an imaginary club whose members would
represent different sectors of the English world: Sir Roger de Coverley
as the English country gentleman; Sir Andrew Freeport representing the
merchant class; Captain Sentry speaking for the army; Will Honeycomb the
man of</p>
<p>fashion; a lawyer of the Inner Temple standing for the world of
learning; and Mr. Spectator himself, who brings all their views together
in a spirit of genial humor and witty courtesy that won him entry into
the homes and hearts of England. In the first number the Spectator
described him- self, and set the clubs and coffeehouses guessing at his
identity.</p>
<p>I have passed my latter years in this city, where I am frequently</p>
<p>seen in most public places, though there are not above half a dozen
of my select friends that know me; of whom my next paper shall give a
more particular account. There is no place of general resort wherein I
do not often make my appearance; sometimes I am seen thrusting my head
into a round of politicians at Will’s, and listening with great
attention to the narratives that are made in those circular audiences.
Sometimes I smoke a pipe at Child’s, and whilst I seem attentive to</p>
<p>nothing but the Postman , overhear the conversation of every table in
the room. I appear on Sunday nights at St. James’s coffee -house, and
sometimes join the little committee of politics in the inner-room as</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>343</p>
<p>one who comes there to hear and improve. My face is likewise very
well known at the Grecian, the Cocoa-tree, and in the theatres both of
Drury-lane and Hay-market. I have been taken for a merchant</p>
<p>upon the Exchange for above these ten years, and sometimes pass for a
Jew in the assembly of stockjobbers at Jonathan’s. In short, wher -</p>
<p>ever I see a cluster of people, I always mix with them, though I
never open my lips but in my own club.</p>
<p>Thus I live in the world rather as a Spectator of mankind, than
as</p>
<p>one of the species, by which means I have made myself a speculative
statesman, soldier, merchant and artisan, without ever meddling with any
practical part in life. I am very well versed in the theory of a</p>
<p>husband, or a father, and can discern the errors in the economy,</p>
<p>business, and diversion of others, better than those who are engaged
in them; as standers-by discover blots which are apt to escape those who
are in the game. I never espoused any party with violence, and am
resolved to observe an exact neutrality between the Whigs and</p>
<p>Tories, unless I shall be forced to declare myself by the hostilities
of either side. In short, I have acted in all the parts of my life as
a</p>
<p>looker-on, which is the character I intend to preserve in this
paper.</p>
<p>As the enterprise proceeded, The Spectator mingled social gossip, and
studies of manners and character, with literary criticism and theatrical
re- views. Addison wrote a series of essays on Milton, in which he
astonished England by ranking Paradise Lost above the Iliad and the
Aeneid. The discussions avoided politics, as leading to enmities and
vicissitudes, but they stressed — and Addison willingly joined in —
Steele’s plea for moral reform. Something of the Puritan spirit,
chastened by adversity, returned in reac- tion against the Restoration
reaction; but now it was no long-faced theo- logical preoccupation with
Satan and damnation, but a call to moderation and decency, cheered with
optimism and coated with wit. So Number io began:</p>
<p>It is with much satisfaction that I hear this great city
inquiring</p>
<p>day by day after these my papers, and receiving my morning lectures
with a becoming seriousness and attention. My publisher tells me, that
there are already three thousand of them distributed every day: so</p>
<p>that if I allow twenty readers to every paper, which I look upon as
a</p>
<p>modest computation, I may reckon about three score thousand dis-
ciples in London and Westminster, who I hope will take care to</p>
<p>distinguish themselves from the thoughtless herd of their ignorant
and unattentive brethren. Since I have raised to myself so great an
audi- ence, I shall spare no pains to make their instruction agreeable,
and their diversion useful. For which reason I shall endeavour to
enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality, that my
readers</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>may, if possible, both ways find their account in the speculation of
the day. And to the end that their virtue and discretion may not be
short, transient, intermitting starts of thought, I have resolved to
refresh</p>
<p>their memories from day to day, till I have recovered them out of
that desperate state of vice and folly, into which the age is fallen.
The</p>
<p>mind that lies fallow but a single day, sprouts up in follies that
are only to be killed by a constant and assiduous culture. It was said
of Socrates, that he brought philosophy down from heaven, to inhabit
among men; and I shall be ambitious to have it said of me, that I have
brought</p>
<p>philosophy out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to
dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables, and in coffee-houses.</p>
<p>I would therefore in a very particular manner recommend these my
speculations to all well-regulated families, that set apart an hour
in</p>
<p>every morning for tea and bread and butter; and would earnestly</p>
<p>advise them for their good to order this paper to be punctually
served up, and to be looked upon as a part of the tea-equipage.</p>
<p>The Spectator addressed itself to women as well as men, proposed to
deal with love and sex, and to make “falsehood in love bear a blacker
aspect than . . . infidelity in friendship, or villainy in business .”
73 “I shall take it fo r the greatest glory of my work,” wrote the
Spectator, “if among reasonable women this paper may furnish tea- table
talk .” 74 Letters were invited and printed, and Steele ran a series of
lovelorn epistles, some of them his own to his ladies, some invented by
the editors in quite modern style. The journal joined religion with
love, and provided a genial theology for a generation beginning to
wonder what the decline of religious belief in the upper classes was
doing to morality. It counseled science to mind its business and let the
Church alone as the wise and experienced guardian of morals; the rights
of feeling and the needs of order are beyond the compre- hension of
individual reason, always adolescent. It is better for morals and
happiness to accept the old religion humbly, attend its services,
observe its holydays, and help to establish in each parish the wholesome
atmosphere of a quiet and worshipful Sabbath.</p>
<p>I am always very well pleased with a country Sunday, and think,
if</p>
<p>keeping holy the seventh day were only a human institution, it would
be the best method that could have been thought of for the polishing and
civilising of mankind. It is certain the country people would soon
degenerate into a kind of savages and barbarians were there not such
frequent returns of a stated time in which the whole village meet to-
gether with their best faces, and in their cleanliest habits, to
converse with one another upon indifferent subjects, hear their duties
explained to them, and join together in adoration of the Supreme Being.
Sunday clears away the rust of the whole week, not only as it refreshes
in</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>345</p>
<p>their minds the notions of religion, but as it puts both the sexes
upon appearing in their most agreeable forms. 75</p>
<p>Now literature, which for forty years had served licentiousness,
moved to the side of morality and faith; The Spectator shared in the
revolution of manners and style that in the reign of Anne anticipated by
a century the mid-Victorian spirit, making respectability respectable,
and changing the English concept of the gentleman from a titled
philanderer to a well- bred citizen. The virtues of the middle class
found in The Spectator an urbane and polished defense. Prudence and
thrift were more precious to society than lace and wit; merchants were
the ambassadors of civilization to backward peoples; and the profits of
commerce and industry were the sinews of the state.</p>
<p>For a year The Spectator enjoyed a succes d’estime unparalleled
in</p>
<p>English journalism. Its circulation was small, rarely exceeding four
thous- and, but its influence was immense. Its bound volumes sold some
nine thousand copies annually, 76 as if England already recognized it to
be litera- ture. But in time the novelty wore off; the characters of the
“club” began to repeat themselves; the verve of the weary authors waned;
their sermons grew tiresome; the circulation declined. The stamp tax of
1712 increased costs beyond revenues, and on December 16, 1712, The
Spectator gave up the ghost. Steele resumed the struggle with The
Guardian , and Addison revived The Spectator , in 1714. Both journals
were short-lived, for by that time Addison had become a successful
dramatist and had been restored to his posts and emoluments in the
government.</p>
<p>On April 14, 1713, the Drury Lane Theatre produced Addison’s Cato.
His friend Pope wrote for it a prologue bristling with Popal epigrams
and heavy with Bullish patriotism. Steele undertook to pack the house
with ardent Whigs; he did not quite succeed, but the Tories joined the
Whigs in applauding Cato’s last stand for Roman liberty (46 b.c.); and
the Tory Examiner rivaled Steele’s Guardian in ecstatic praise. For an
entire month the tragedy played to overflowing audiences. “Cato,” said
Pope, “was not so much the wonder of Rome in his. days as he is of
Britain in ours .” 77 On the Continent Cato was rated the finest tragic
drama in the English language. Voltaire admired its adherence to the
unities, and marveled that England could tolerate Shakespeare after
seeing Addison’s play. 78 Critics now deride it as vapid declamation,
but one reader has found his attention held to the end by a
well-constructed plot, and a love story skillfully integrated into the
larger war.</p>
<p>Addison was now so popular that “I believe,” said Swift, “if he had a
mind to be chosen king he w ould hardly be refused.” 79 But Addison, al
- ways a model of moderation, contented himself with being appointed</p>
<p>346</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>secretary to the government, presently chief secretary for Ireland,
then a lord commissioner of trade. He was persona gratissima at the
clubs, for his hard drinking kept him from being the “faultless monster
whom the world ne’er” loves. To crown his glory he married (1716) a
countess, and lived unhappily with the proud lady at Holland House in
London. In</p>
<p>1717 he was again a secretary of state; but his competence was
questioned, and he soon resigned, with a pension of £ 1,500 a year.
Despite his patience and good manners he slipped into quarrels with his
friends, including Steele and Pope — who satirized him as a prig wont to
“damn with faint praise,” and,</p>
<p>Like Cato, give his little senate laws,</p>
<p>And sit attentive to his own applause. 80</p>
<p>Steele came to a less stately end. He was elected to Parliament in
1713, but the Tory majority expelled him on a charge of seditious
language. The triumph of the Whigs a year later consoled him with
several lucrative places in the administration, and for a time his
income equaled his ex- penditures. Then his debts won the race, his
creditors pursued him, and he retired to his wife’s estate in Wales.
There he died, September 1, 1729, ten years after his collaborator.
Together, Steele with originality and verve, Addison with polished
artistry, they had raised the short story and the essay to new
excellence, had shared in the moral regeneration of the age, and had set
the tone and forms of English literature for a century — except for the
most powerful and bitter genius of the age.</p>
<p>VIII: JONATHAN SWIFT: 1667-1745</p>
<p>Swift was five years older than Steele and Addison, but he outlived
the one by sixteen, the other by twenty-six years, and served as a
living fire that ran from century to century, from Dryden to Pope. He
could never forgive his birth in Dublin, which«proved an irritating
handicap in Eng- land; and it was cruel that his father, steward of the
King’s Inns in Dublin, died before Jonathan appeared. The child was put
out to nurse; the nurse took it to England, and returned it to its
mother only when it was three years old. These adventures may have
begotten in the boy a sense of orphaned insecurity. This must have been
deepened by his being trans- ferred to an uncle, who soon disposed of
him, aged six, to a boarding school at Kilkenny. At fifteen he was sent
to Trinity College, Dublin,</p>
<p>where he remained for seven years. He barely scraped through, being
especially negligent in theology. He was often delinquent, often
punished,</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>and he was reduced to precarious poverty when the uncle who was
paying his expenses suffered final reverses and mental collapse (1688).
On his uncle’s death (1689), and amid the uprising of Ireland for James
II,</p>
<p>Jonathan fled to England and his mother, who was living at Leicester
on twenty pounds a year. Despite their long separation they got along
rea- sonably well; he learned to love her, and visited her, now and
then, till her death (1710).</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1689 he found employment, at twenty pounds a year
and board, as secretary to Sir William Temple at Moor Park. Temple was
then at the height of his career, the friend and adviser of kings; we
must not berate him for failing to recognize genius in the twenty-two-
year-old youth who came to him with some Latin and Greek, but also an
Irish brogue, and furtive uncertainty about the relative functions of
knives and forks. 81 Swift sat with the upper servants at the master’s
table, 82 but the master always kept his distance. Yet Temple was kind.
In 1692 he sent Swift to Oxford to acquire the M.A. degree; and he
recommended him to William III, without result.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jonathan was writing couplets. He showed some of them to
Dryden, who told him, “Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet” — a
prediction whose accuracy was beyond the young man’s appreciation. In
1694 Swift left Temple with a recommendation from his master; he re-
turned to Ireland, was ordained an Anglican priest (1695), and was ap-
pointed to a small benefice at Kilroot, near Belfast. In Belfast he fell
in love with Jane Waring, whom he called Varina; he proposed marriage,
but she held him off until time should improve her health and his
income. Unable to bear the dull isolation of a country parish, he fled
from Kilroot in 1696, went back to Temple, and remained in Sir William’s
service till the latter’s death.</p>
<p>During his first year at Moor Park Swift had met the Esther
Johnson</p>
<p>who was to become his “Stella.” Some gossip thoug ht her the result
of Sir William’s rare impulsiveness; more likely she was the daughter of
a London merchant, whose widow had entered Lady Temple’s service. When
Swift first saw her she was a girl of eight, delightful like all girls
of eight, but too young to arouse in him any amorous unrest. Now, how-
ever, she was fifteen; and Swift, turning twenty-nine, soon discovered
as her tutor that she had charms to rouse a savage breast priestly but
starved. Black, shining eyes, raven hair, swelling bosom, “ a
gracefulness somewhat more than human in every motion, word, and action”
(so he later de - scribed her), and “every feature of her face in
perfection” 83 — how could this Heloi’se avoid awakening this
Abelard?</p>
<p>Temple, dying (1699), left a thousand pounds to Esther, a thousand to
Swift. After vain hopes of governmental employment. Swift accepted
an</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>invitation to become chaplain and secretary to the Earl of Berkeley,
who had just been appointed a lord justice in Ireland. He acted as
secretary on the journey to Dublin; but there he was dismissed. He asked
for the deanery of Derry, which was falling vacant, but the new
secretary, for a bribe of a thousand pounds, gave the place to another
candidate. Swift denounced the Earl and the secretary to their faces as
“a couple of</p>
<p>scoundrels.” They quieted him with the rectory of Laracor, a village
some twenty miles from Dublin, with a congregation of fifteen persons.
Swift had now (1700) an income of ^230, which Jane Waring thought might
suffice for marriage. However, she was four years older than when he had
proposed to her, and meanwhile he had discovered Esther. He wrote to
Jane that if she would submit to enough education to make her a suitable
companion in his home, if she would promise to accept all his likes and
dislikes, and soothe his ill-humor, he would take her without inquiring
into her looks or her income. 84 The affair ended.</p>
<p>Lonely in Laracor, Swift made frequent visits to Dublin. There,
in</p>
<p>1701, he took his degree as a doctor of divinity. Later in that year
he invited Esther Johnson and her companion, Mrs. Robert Dingley, to
come and live in Laracor. They came, took lodgings near him, and during
his absences in England they occupied the apartment he had rented in
Dublin. “Stella” expected him to marry her, but he kept her waiting for
fifteen years. She accepted her situation fretfully, but the force of
his character and the sharpness of his intellect held her hypnotized to
the end.</p>
<p>The quality of his mind showed alarmingly when, in 1704, he published
in one volume The Battle of the Books and The Tale of a Tub. The</p>
<p>former is a brief and negligible contribution to the controversy as
to the relative merits of ancient and modern literature; but The Tale of
a Tub is a major exposition of Swift’s religious, or irreligious,
philosophy. Re - reading this work in later fife, he exclaimed, “Good
God! what a genius I had w hen I wrote that book!” 85 He loved it so
much that in later editions he caressed it with fifty pages of nonsense
in the form of prefaces and apologies. He prided himself on its complete
originality; and though the Church had long since spoken of Christ
ianity as the once “seamless robe of Christ” tom to pieces by the
Reformation, no one — least of all the Carlyle of Sartor Resartus — has
impugned the unprecedented force with which Swift here reduced all
philosophies and religions to diverse garments used to clothe our
shivering ignorance or conceal our naked desires.</p>
<p>What is man himself but a micro-coat, or rather a complete set of</p>
<p>clothes with all its trimmings? … Is not religion a cloak; honesty
a</p>
<p>pair of shoes worn out in the dirt; self-love a surtout; vanity a
shirt;</p>
<p>and conscience a pair of breeches which, though a cover for
lewdness</p>

<p>as well as for nastiness, is easily slipped down for the service of
both?</p>
<p>If certain ermines and furs be placed in a certain position, we style
a judge; and so an apt conjunction of lawn and black satin we entitle a
bishop . 86</p>
<p>The garment allegory is carried out with thoroughness and
finesse.</p>
<p>Peter (Catholicism), Martin (Lutheranism and Anglicanism) and Jack
(Calvinism) received from their dying father three new and identical
coats (Bibles) , and a will directing them how to wear these, and
forbidding them ever to alter, add to, or diminish them by even a single
thread. The sons fall in love with three ladies: the Duchess d’ Argent
(wealth), Mme. de Grands Titres (ambition), and the Countess d’Orgueil
(pride). To please these ladies the brothers make certain changes in
their inherited coats; and when the alterations s eem to contradict
their father’s will, they reinterpret</p>
<p>dulgences) over and over again; upon his sovereign and usually
painless remedies (penances) for worms (gnawings of conscience) — for
example, “to eat nothing after supper for three nights . . . and by no
means to break</p>
<p>riched by these wise expedients, Peter sets himself up as the
representative of God. He claps three high-crowned hats upon his head,
and holds an angling rod in his hand; and when anyone wishes to shake
his hand, he, “like a well - educated spaniel,” offers them his foot .
88 He invites his brothers to dinner, gives them nothing but bread,
assures them that it is not bread but meat, and refutes their
objections: “To convince you wh at a couple of blind, positive,
ignorant, willful puppies you are, I will use but this</p>
<p>simple argument. By G , it is true, good, natural mutton as any
in</p>
<p>Leadenhall Market, and G confound you both eternally if you offer</p>
<p>to believe otherwise .” 89 The brothers rebel, make “true copies” of
the will (vernacular translations of the Bible), and denounce Peter as
an impostor; whereupon he “kicked them out of doors, and would never let
them come under his roof from that day to this .” 90 Soon thereafter the
brothers quarrel as to how much of their inherited coats they may
discard or change. Martin,</p>
<p>35 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>after his first anger, resolves on moderation, and recalls that Peter
is his brother; Jack, however, tears his coat to shreds (Calvinist
sects), and falls into fits of madness and zeal. Swift proceeds to
describe the strange opera- tions of wind (inspiration) in the
“Aeolists” (Calvinist preachers); and has much fun — some quite
unprintable — with their nasal speech, predes- tination theories, and
idolatry of the Scriptural word . 81</p>
<p>So far the author’s own creed, Anglicanism, had come off with
only</p>
<p>minor scars. But as the tale proceeds Swift, changing coats for
winds, apparently reduces not only the Dissenting theologies but all
religions and philosophies to vaporous delusions:</p>
<p>If we take a survey of the greatest actions that have been performed
in the world . . ., which are the establishment of new empires by</p>
<p>conquest, the advance and progress of new schemes in philosophy, and
the contriving, as well as the propagating, of new religions, we</p>
<p>shall find the authors of them all to have been persons whose natural
reason had admitted great revolutions, from their diet, their educa-
tion, the prevalency of some certain temper, together with the par-
ticular influence of air and climate … For the human understanding,
seated in the brain, must be troubled and overspread by vapors</p>
<p>ascending from the lower faculties to water the invention and render
it fruitful . 92</p>
<p>Swift gives, in unquotable physiological detail, what seemed to him a
fine example of internal secretions generating mighty ideas, even Henry
IV’s “Grand Design”: th e French King had been inspired to war against
the Hapsburgs by the thought of capturing on the way a woman (Charlotte
de Montmorency) whose beauty had stirred up in him sundry juices, “which
ascended to the brain .” 93 It was likewise with the great ph
ilosophers, who were rightly judged by their contemporaries to be “out
of their wits.”</p>
<p>Of this kind were Epicurus, Diogenes, Apollonius, Lucretius,</p>
<p>Paracelsus, Descartes, and others; who, if they were now in the</p>
<p>world, . . . would, in this understanding age, incur manifest
danger</p>
<p>of phlebotomy 〔medical bleeding〕, and whips, and chains, and
dark</p>
<p>chambers, and straw. . . . Now I would gladly be informed how it
is</p>
<p>possible to account for such imaginations . . . without reference
to</p>
<p>. . . vapors ascending from the lower faculties to overshadow the</p>
<p>brain, and there distilling into conceptions for which the narrowness
of our mother-tongue has not yet assigned any other name beside that of
madness or frenzy . 94</p>
<p>To similar “disturbance or transpositio n of the brain by force of
certain vapors issuing up from the lower faculties,” Swift ascribes “all
those</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>35 *</p>
<p>mighty revolutions that have happened in empire, philosophy, and re-
ligion.” 95 He concludes that all systems of thought are winds of words,
and that the wise man will not attempt to pierce to the inner reality of
things, but will content himself with the surface; whereupon Swift uses
one of the pleasant similes to whic h he had a turn: “Last week I saw a
woman flayed, and you will hardly believe how much it altered her person
for the worse.” 96</p>
<p>This scandalous little book, blown up to 130 pages, established Swift
at once as a master of satire — a Rabelais perfectionne, Voltaire was to
call him. The allegory was verbally consistent with Swift’s profession
of</p>
<p>Anglican orthodoxy, but many readers felt that the author was a
skeptic, if not an atheist. Archbishop Sharp told Queen Anne that Swift
was little better than an infidel, 97 and Anne’s confidante, the Duchess
of Marlbor - ough, was of opinion that Swift</p>
<p>had long ago turned all religion into a Tale of a Tub and sold it for
a</p>
<p>jest. But he had taken it ill that the 〔Whig〕 ministry had not
promoted him in the Church for the great zeal he had shown for religion
by his profane drollery; and so 〔he〕 carried his atheism raid his
humor into service of their enemies. 98</p>
<p>Steele too called Swift an infidel, and Nottingham, in the House of
Com- mons, des cribed him as a divine “who is hardly suspected of being
a</p>
<p>Christian.” 99 Swift had read Hobbes, an experience not easily
forgotten. Hobbes had begun with fear, passed to materialism, and ended
as a Tory supporting the Established Church. It was small consolation to
the men of religion that Swift made short work of philosophy:</p>
<p>The various opinions of philosophers have scattered through the</p>
<p>world as many plagues of the mind as Pandora’s box did those of the
body, only with this difference, that they have not left hope at the</p>
<p>bottom . . . Truth is as hidden as the source of the Nile, and can
be</p>
<p>found only in Utopia. 100</p>
<p>Perhaps because he felt that truth was not meant for man, he resented
with special warmth those religious sects that professed to have the
“true religion,” and he scorned men who, like Bunyan and some Quakers,
claimed to have seen or talked with God. He concluded, with Hobbes, that
it was social suicide to let every man make his own religion; the result
would be such a maelstrom of absurdities that society would be a
madhouse. So he opposed free thought, on the ground that “the bulk of
mankind is as well qualified for flying as thinking.” 101 He repudiated
toleration. To the end of his life he supported the Test Act, which
excluded from political</p>
<p>352</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>or military office all but adherents of the Established Church. 102
He agreed with Catholic and Lutheran rulers that a nation should have
only one religion; and, having been born into an England with an
Established</p>
<p>Anglican Church, he thought that a general and unified acceptance of
that Church was indispensable to the process of civilizing Englishmen.
These were the Sentiments of a Church of England Man, this the Argument
to Prove that the Abolishing of Christianity in England May . . . Be
Attended •with Some Inconveniences — tracts which he published in 1708
on his way from the Whigs to the Tories.</p>
<p>His first political associations after leaving Temple were with the
Whigs, for these seemed to be the more progressive party, and the
likelier to find a place for a man with more brains than money. In 1701
he published a Whiggish pamphlet hopefully. Halifax, Sunderland, and
other Whig</p>
<p>leaders welcomed him to the party, and promised him some preferment
should they come to power. The promises were not fulfilled; perhaps
these men feared Swift’s temper as unmanageable, and his pen as a double
-edged sword. On an extended visit from Ireland to London in 1705 Swift
won the friendship of Congreve, Addison, and Steele. Addison inscribed
to him a copy of Travels in Italy with the words: “To Jonathan Swift,
the most agreeable companion, the truest friend, and the greatest genius
of his age, this work is presented by his most humble servant the
author”; 103 but this friendship, like those of Jonathan with Steele and
Pope, withered in Swift’s rising fire.</p>
<p>On another visit to London he amused himself by destroying a pre-</p>
<p>tentious astrologer. John Partridge, a cobbler, sent forth each year
an almanac rich in predictions based on the progress of the stars. In
1708 Swift issued a rival almanac under the pseudonym of Isaac
Bickerstaff. One of Isaac’s predictions was that at 1 1 p . m . on Mar
ch 29 Partridge would die. On March 30 “Bickerstaff” published a letter
triumphantly announc - ing that Partridge had died within a few hours of
the predicted time, and stating in convincing detail the arrangements
for the funeral. Partridge assured London that he was still alive, but
Isaac retorted that this assurance was a forgery. The wits of the city
took up the hoax; the Stationer’s Office struck Partridge’s name from
its rolls; and Steele, inaugurating The Tatler in the following year,
adopted Isaac Bickerstaff as its imaginary editor.</p>
<p>In 1710 Swift again left Laracor, this time as an emissary of the
Irish</p>
<p>bishops to ask that “Queen Anne’s Bounty” be extended to the Anglican
clergy of Ireland. Godolphin and Somers, Whig members of the Queen’s
Council, refused to grant this unless the clergy agreed to relax the
Test Act. Swift strongly objected to such relaxation. The Whigs
discovered that he was a Tory in religion, and Swift practically
confessed himself a Tory in politics when he wrote: “ I ever abominated
that scheme of</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM 0RYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>politics … of setting up a moneyed interest in opposition to the
landed.” 104 He applied to the Tory leaders, Harley and Bolingbroke,
received a hearty welcome, and became overnight a confirmed Tory. Made
editor of the Tory Examiner, Swift signalized his style by describing
the Whig Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, whose secretary was Swift’s friend
Addison:</p>
<p>Thomas, Earl of Wharton, … by the force of a wonderful consti-</p>
<p>tution, has some years passed his grand climacteric without any
visible effects of old age, either in his body or his mind; and in spite
of a</p>
<p>continual prostitution to those vices which usually wear out
both.</p>
<p>… He goes constantly to prayers .. . . and will talk bawdy and
blas-</p>
<p>phemy at the chapel door. He is a Presbyterian in politics, an
atheist in religion; but he chooses at present to whore with: a papist .
105</p>
<p>Delighted with this assassination, the Tory ministers
commissioned</p>
<p>Swift to write a tract, The Conduct of the Allies (November, 1711),
as part of their campaign to depose Marlborough and end the War of the
Spanish Succession. Swift argued that the unpopular taxes levied to
finance the long conflict with Louis XIV could be reduced by confining
England’s share in it to the sea; and he stated with force the complaint
of the land- holders that the cost of the war fell too much upon the
land, too little upon the merchants and manufacturers, who were doing
quite well out of the war. As to Marlborough: “Whether this war was
prudently begun or not, it is plain that the true spring or motive of it
was the aggrandizing a particular family, and in short a war of the
General and the 〔Whig〕</p>
<p>ministry, and not of the Prince or people.” 106 He summed up
Marlborough’s emoluments at £ 540,000 — “and the figure was not
inaccurate.” 107 A month later Marlborough was condemned. His candid
Duchess, who had the only tongue in England as sharp as S wift’s, viewed
the matter from the Whig point of view in her memoirs:</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Swift and Mr. Prior quickly offered themselves to</p>
<p>sale, . . . both men of wit and parts, ready to prostitute all they
had</p>
<p>in the service of well-rewarded scandal, being both of a composition
past the weakness of blushing or of stumbling at anything for the</p>
<p>interest of their new masters . 108</p>
<p>These rewarded their new servants. Matthew Prior was sent as a diplo-
mat to France, where he acquitted himself well. Swift received no
office, but was now so intimate with the Tory ministers that he was able
to secure many a sinecure for his friends. He was the genius of
generosity to those who did not cross him. He claimed later that he had
done fifty times more for fifty people than Temple had ever done for
him. 109 He</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>THE AGE OP LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>persuaded Bolingbroke to help the poet Gay. He saw to it that the
Tory ministry should continue the pension that Congreve had received
from the Whigs. When Pope asked for subscriptions to finance him while
trans- lating Homer, Swift commanded all his friends and place-seekers
to sub- scribe, and vowed that “the author shall not begin to print till
I have a thousand guineas for him.” 110 He outs hone Addison at the
clubs. Almost every evening now he dined with the great, and brooked no
superior airs from any of them. “I am so proud,” he wrote to Stella,
“that I make all the lords come up to me … I was to have supped at Lady
Ashburnham’s, but the drab did not call for us in her coach as she
promised, but sent for us, and so I sent my excuses.” 111</p>
<p>It was during these three years (17 10-13) ln England that he
wrote</p>
<p>the strange letters published in 1766-68 as the Journal to Stella. He
needed someone as the confidante of his ducal dinners and political
victories; be- sides, he loved the patient woman, now approaching
thirty, but still waiting for him to make up his mind. He must have
loved her, for sometimes he wrote to her twice a day, and he showed his
interest in everything about her except marriage. We should never have
expected, from so overbear- ing a man, such playful delicacies and
fanciful nicknames, such jokes and puns and baby talk as Swift, not
expecting their publication, poured into these letters. They are rich in
caresses but poor in proposals, unless Stella could have read a promise
of marriage in his letter of May 23, 1711: “I will say no more, but beg
you to be easy till Fortune takes her course, and to believe that M.D.’s
〔Stella’s〕 felicity is the greatest goal I aim at</p>
<p>I was this forenoon with Mr. Secretary at his office, and helped</p>
<p>to hinder a man of his pardon, who is condemned for a rape. The</p>
<p>Under Secretary was willing to save him, upon an old notion that
a</p>
<p>woman cannot be ravished; but I told the Secretary that he could not
pardon him without a favorable report from the judge; besides, he is a
fiddler, and consequently a rogue, and deserved hanging for some-</p>
<p>thing else; and so he shall swing. What; I must stand up for the
honor of the fair sex! ’Tis true, the fellow had lain with her a hundred
times</p>
<p>because she is a whore ? 113</p>
<p>Swift’s physical ailments may help us to understand his ill -humor.
As early as 1694, aged twenty-seven, he had begun to suffer from vertigo
in the labyrinth of the ear; occasionally and incalculably he
experienced fits of dizziness and deafness. A famous Dr. Radcliffe
recommended a com-</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>plex liquid to be held in a bag inside Swift’s wig. The malady became
worse with the years, and may have caused his insanity. Probably in 1717
he said to the poet Edward Young, pointing to a withering tree, “I shall
be lik e that tree: I shall die at the top.” 114 This alone was enough
to make him question the value of life, and certainly to doubt the
wisdom of mar- riage. Probably he was impotent, but of this we have no
certainty. He took to much walking to fend off physical decay; once he
walked from Farnham to London — thirty-eight miles.</p>
<p>His malaise was heightened by a painful keenness of the senses, which
often goes with sharpness of mind. He was especially sensitive to odors,
in city streets and in human beings; he could tell at a smell the
hygiene of the men and women whom he met; and he concluded that the
human race stank. 115 His conception of a lovable woman was partly
that</p>
<p>No noisome Whiffs or sweating Streams</p>
<p>Before, behind, above, below</p>
<p>Could from her taintless body flow. 116</p>
<p>He describes “A Beautiful Young Nymph Going to Bed,” and then the
same lady on arising:</p>
<p>Corinna in the morning dizen’d</p>
<p>Who sees, will spew, who smells, be poison’d.</p>
<p>And his conception of a nice young woman is olfactory:</p>
<p>Her dearest comrades never caught her</p>
<p>Squat on her hams to make Maid’s water;</p>
<p>You’d swear that so divine a creature</p>
<p>Felt no necessities of nature.</p>
<p>In summer, had she walked the town,</p>
<p>Her armpits would not stain her gown;</p>
<p>At country dances not a nose</p>
<p>Could in the dog days smell her toes. 117</p>
<p>He himself was finically clean. And yet the writings of this
Anglican</p>
<p>divine are among the coarsest in English literature. His anger at
life made him fling his faults into the face of his time. He made no
effort to please, and every effort to dominate, for domination comforted
his secret uncer- tainty of himself. He said that he hated (feared) all
those whom he could not command; 118 this, however, was not true of his
affection for Harley. He was angry in adversity, and arrogant in
success. He loved power more than money; when Harley sent him fifty
pounds for his articles he returned the bank note, demanded an apology,
received it, and wrote to Stella, “I</p>
<p>35 &lt;*</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>have taken Mr. Harley into favor again.” 119 He resented formality,
and despised cant. The world seemed bent on defeating him, and he
frankly returned its hostility. He wrote to Pope:</p>
<p>The chief end I propose to myself in all my labors is to vex the</p>
<p>world rather than divert it; and if I could compass that design
without hurting my own person or fortune, I would be the most
indefatigable writer you have ever seen . . . When you think of the
world, give</p>
<p>it one lash the more at my request. I have ever hated all nations,
pro- fessions, and communities, and all my love is towards individuals .
. .</p>
<p>I hate the tribe of lawyers, but I love Councillor Such-a-one and
Judge Such-a-one; so with physicians (1 will not speak of my own
trade),</p>
<p>soldiers, English, Scotch, French, and the rest. But principally I
hate</p>
<p>and detest that animal called man — although I heartily love
John,</p>
<p>Peter, Thomas, and so forth. 120</p>
<p>He appears at this distance the least lovable of men, and yet two
women loved him to their deaths. During these years in London he lived
near a Mrs. Vanhomrigh, a rich widow with two sons and two daughters.
When he could not secure an invitation to titled tables he dined with
the “Vans.” The eldest daughter, Hester, then ( 1 7 1 1 ) twenty-four,
fell in love with him, forty-three, and told him so. He tried to pass
this off as a transient humor, and explained that he was too old for
her; she replied, hopefully, that he had in his books taught her to love
great men (she read Montaigne at her toilet), and why should she not
love a great man when she found him in the flesh? He was half melted. He
composed a poem, intended for her eyes only, Cadenus and Vanessa,
humorous and tragical. Vanessa was his name for her; Cadenus was an
anagram for dec anus, dean.</p>
<p>For in April, 1713, the Queen had reluctantly appointed him dean of
St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin. In June he went to Ireland to be
installed. He saw Stella, and wrote to Vanessa that he was dying of
melancholy and discontent. 121 He returned to London (October, 1713),
and shared in the debacle of the Tories in 1714. Politically powerless
now that the Whigs whom he had attacked were triumphant under George I,
he went back to hated Ireland and his deanery. He was unpopular in
Dublin, for the Whigs who now ruled it hated him for his diatribes, and
the Dissenters hated him for his insistence on excluding them from
office. People hissed and booed him in the streets, and pelted him with
gutter filth. 122 An Anglican clergy- man expressed the view of his
cloth in a poem which was nailed to the cathedral door:</p>
<p>Today this temple gets a Dean,</p>
<p>Of parts and fame uncommon;</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>Used both to pray and to profane,</p>
<p>To serve both God and Mammon . . .</p>
<p>The place he got by wit and rhyme,</p>
<p>And many ways most odd,</p>
<p>And might a bishop be in time</p>
<p>Did he believe in God. 123</p>
<p>He stood his ground bravely, continued to support the Tories, and</p>
<p>offered to share Harley’s imprisonment in the Tower. He attended to
his religious duties, preached regularly, administered the sacraments,
lived simply, and gave a third of his income in charity. On Sundays he
held open house; Stella then came to play hostess for him. Soon his
unpopularity waned. In 1724 he published, under the pseudonym of M. B.
Drapier, six letters denouncing the attempt of William Wood to make a
large profit out of supplying Ireland with a copper currency. The Irish
resented the proposal, and when “Drapier” was discovered to be Swift,
the gloomy Dean became almost popular.</p>
<p>He might have had some moments of happiness had he been able to keep
the Irish Channel between the two women who loved him. In 1714
Mrs. Vanhomrigh died, and “Vanessa” moved to Ireland to occupy a small
property bequeathed to her by her father at Celbridge, eleven miles west
of the capital. To be nearer the Dean, she took a lodging in Turnstile
Alley, Dublin, a short distance from where Stella lived. She wrote to
Swift, begging him to visit her, and warned him that if he failed to
come she would die of grief. He could not resist her appeal, and now
(1714-23) he went repeatedly and clandestinely to see her. When his
visits became less frequent, her letters became more ardent. She had
been born, she told him, with “violent passions, which terminate all in
one, that inexpressible passion I have for you.” It would be useless,
she told him, to try to turn her love to God; for “was I an enthusiast,
still you’d be the deity I should worship.” 124</p>
<p>Perhaps he thought to break through this imprisoning triangle by
marry- ing; perhaps Stella, conscious of a rival, demanded it as simple
justice; and the balance of the evidence is that he did marry Stella in
17 16. 125 Appar- ently he required her to keep the marriage secret; she
continued to live apart; and probably the union was never consummated.
Swift resumed his visits to Vanessa; not that he was merely a
philanderer or altogether a brute, but presumably because he had not the
heart to leave her hopeless, or he feared her suicide. His letters
assured Vanessa that he loved and valued her above all things, and would
do so to the end of his life. So the affair went on till 1723; then
Vanessa wrote to Stella asking her point blank what was her connection
with the Dean. Stella took the letter to Swift. He rode to Vane ssa’s
lodging, flung the letter down upon her table, terrified</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>her with his angry looks, and, without a word, left her, never to see
her again.</p>
<p>When Vanessa recovered from her fright she realized at last that he
had been deceiving her. Hopelessness combined with a consumptive
tendency to destroy what was left of her health; and within two months
of that last interview she died (June 2, 1723), aged thirty-four. She
took revenge in her will: she revoked an earlier testament that had made
Swift her heir; she bequeathed her goods to Robert Marshall and George
Berkeley, the phi- losopher; and she bade them publish, without comment,
Swift’s letters to her, and his poem Cadenus and Vanessa. Swift fled on
an obscure “southern journey” in Ireland, and did not reappear in his
cathedral until four months after Vanessa’s death.</p>
<p>When he returned he gave his leisure to composing the most famous and
savage satire ever directed against mankind. He wrote to Charles Ford
that he was engaged upon a book that would “wonderfully rend the world.”
128 A year later it was complete, and he took the manuscript in person
to Lon- don, arranged for its anonymous publication, accepted two
hundred pounds for it, and went to Pope’s house in Twickenham to enjoy
the expected</p>
<p>The story weakens in Gulliver’s third voyage. He is pulled up by
chain and bucket to Laputa, an island floating in the air and inhabited
and gov- erned by scientists, scholars, inventors, professors, and
philosophers; here the details that elsewhere lent verisimilitude to the
narrative are a bit silly, like the little bladders with which servants
tap the ears and mouths of the profound thinkers to rouse them from
dangerous absent-mindedness in their</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>cogitations. The Academy of Lagado, with its fanciful inventions and
decrees, is a feeble satire on Bacon’s Ne w Atlantis and the Royal
Society of London. Swift had no faith in the reform or rule of states by
scientists; he laughed at their theories, and the early mortality
thereof; and he pre- dicted the overthrow of the Newtonian cosmology:
“New systems of na - ture were but new fashions, which would vary in
every age; and even those who pretend to demonstrate them from
mathematical principles 〔Principia Mathematica, 1687〕 would flourish
but a short period of time.” 128</p>
<p>So Gulliver moves on to the land of Luggnaggians, who condemn their
greatest criminals not to death but to immortality. When these “Struld -
brugs”</p>
<p>came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity of living in
their country, they had not only all the follies and infirmities of</p>
<p>other old men, but many more, which arose from the dreadful</p>
<p>prospects of never dying. They were not only opinionative, peevish,
covetous, morose, vain, talkative; but incapable of friendship, and</p>
<p>dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their
grand- children. Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing
passions. . . . Whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that
others are gone to an harbor of rest, to which they themselves never can
hope to arrive. . . . They were the most mortifying sight I ever
beheld,</p>
<p>and the women more horrible than the men. . . . From what I had</p>
<p>heard and seen, my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much</p>
<p>abated. 129</p>
<p>In Part IV Swift discarded humor for a sardonic excoriation of
humanity. The land of the Houyhnhnms is governed by clean, handsome,
genial horses, who speak, reason, and have all the marks of civilization
while their menial servants, the Yahoos, are men dirty, odorous, greedy,
drunken, ir- rational, and deformed. Among these degenerates (wrote
Swift in the days of George I)</p>
<p>there was a . . . ruling Yahoo 〔king〕 who was always more deformed
in body, and mischievous in disposition, than any of the rest. . . .
This leader had usually a favorite as like himself as he could get,
whose em- ployment was to lick his master’s feet . . . and drive the
female Yahoos to his kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with
a piece of ass’s flesh 〔title of nobility?〕. . . . He usually
continues in office till</p>
<p>a worse can be found. 180</p>
<p>By contrast the Houyhnhnms, being reasonable, are happy and virtuous;
therefore they need no physicians, lawyers, clergymen, or generals.
These gentlemanly horses are shocked by Gulliver’s account of Europe’s
wars,</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>and still more by the disputes that generated them — as “whether
flesh be bread, or bread be flesh 〔in the Eucharist〕 ; whether the
juice of a certain berry be blood or wine”; 131 and they cut Gulliver
short when he boasts how many human beings could now be blown up by the
marvelous inventions which his race has invented.</p>
<p>When Gulliver returns to Europe he can hardly bear the smell of the
streets and the people, who now all seem to be Yahoos.</p>
<p>My wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, be-</p>
<p>cause they 〔had〕 concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely</p>
<p>confess that the sight of them filled me only with hatred, disgust,
and contempt … As soon as I entered the house my wife took me in her</p>
<p>arms, and kissed me; at which, having not been used to the touch of
that odious animal 〔man〕 for so many years, I fell in a swoon for</p>
<p>almost an hour. . . . During the first year I could not endure my
wife</p>
<p>or children in my presence, the very smell of them was
intolerable</p>
<p>. . . The first money I laid out was to buy two young . . . horses,
which I keep in a good stable; and next to them the groom is my
greatest</p>
<p>favorite, for I feel my spirit revived by the smell he contracts in
the</p>
<p>stable. 132</p>
<p>The success of Gulliver exceeded the author’s dreams, and might have
mollified his olfactory misanthropy. Readers enjoyed the spare and
limpid English, the circumstantial details, the hilarious obscenities.
Arbuthnot predicted for the book “as great a run as John Bunyan” — i.e.,
as for Pil- grim’s Progress. Doubtless Swift owed something to that
book, more to Robinson Cr usoe, something, perhaps, to Cyrano de
Bergerac’s Histoires comiques des etats et empire de la lune. What was
quite new was the awful cynicism of the later parts, and even this found
admirers. Marlborough’s Duchess, now in her rasping old age, forgave
Swift his attacks upon her husband in consideration of his attacks upon
mankind. Swift, she declared, had given “the most accurate account of
kings, ministers, bishops, and courts of justice that is possible to be
writ.” Gay reported that she “is in raptures with the book, and can
dream of nothing else.” 133</p>
<p>Swift’s triumph was soured by the publication, in the same year
as</p>
<p>Gulliver, of his poem Cadenus and Vanessa. Hester Vanhomrigh’s
executors had obeye d her injunction to print it, and had not asked the
author’s per - mission. It appeared in separate editions in London,
Dublin, and Edinburgh. It was a cruel blow to Stella, for she saw how
many of the loving phrases once addressed to her had been repeated to
Vanessa. Shortly after that revelation she took sick. Swift crossed to
Ireland to comfort her; she im- proved, and he returned to England
(1727). Soon news came to him that she was dying. He sent hurried
instructions to his cathedral aides that</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>FROM DRYDEN TO SWIFT</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>“Stella must not die in the Deanery.” 134 He came back to Dublin, and
once more she rallied; but on January 28, 1728, she died, aged
forty-seven. Swift broke down, and was too ill to attend her
funeral.</p>
<p>Thereafter he lived in Dublin (as he wrote to Bolingbroke) “like
a</p>
<p>poisoned rat in a hole.” 135 He extended his charities, gave a
pension to Mrs. Dingley, and helped Richard Sheridan in his youthful
scrapes. Apparently a cruel man, he was touched to bitter wrath by the
poverty of the Irish people, and was shocked by the number of child
beggars in Dublin’s</p>
<p>streets. In 1729 he issued the most ferocious of his ironies: A
Modest Pro- posal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being
a Burden to Their Parents or Country .</p>
<p>I have been assured . . . that a young healthy child well nursed,
is,</p>
<p>at a year old, a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food,</p>
<p>whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that
it will equally serve in a fricassee or ragout. I do therefore
humbly</p>
<p>offer it to public consideration, that of the hundred and twenty
thou- sand children already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved
for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males . . . That the re-
maining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the
persons of quality and fortune throughout the Kingdom; always advis- ing
the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to
render them plump and fat for a good table. A child will make two</p>
<p>dishes at an entertainment for friends; and when the family dines</p>
<p>alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and,
sea- soned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good . . .</p>
<p>Those who are more thrifty . . . may flay the carcass, the skin
of</p>
<p>which, artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves for ladies,
and summer boots for fine gentlemen. . . .</p>
<p>Some persons of desponding spirit are in great concern about that</p>
<p>vast number of poor people who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I
have been desired to employ my thoughts, what course may be taken to
ease the nation of so grievous an encumbrance. But I am not in the least
pain upon that matter; because it is very well known that they are every
day dying and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth and</p>
<p>vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. . . .</p>
<p>I think the advantages 〔of〕 the proposal which I have made are</p>
<p>obvious and many . . .For first, … it would greatly lessen the
num-</p>
<p>ber of Papists with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal
breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies . . .</p>
<p>Thirdly, whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children,
from two years old and upward, cannot be computed at less than</p>
<p>ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation’s stock will be thereby
in - creased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a

<p>The strange and sometimes revolting productions of Swift’s pen, espec
- ially after Stella’s death, suggest the germs of insanity. “A person
of great</p>
<p>Life’s cruelty to him took its final form in the day -by-day
impairment of his sanity. After 1728 his avarice grew even amid his
charities; he grudged the food he fed to his guests, and the wine he
served to his friends. 138 His vertigo became worse, and he could never
tell at what in- auspicious moment it might send him reeling in his
chancel or in the street. He had refused to wear spectacles; now his
sight was so poor that he had to give up reading. Some of his friends
died, some shunned his temper and gloom. “I have often thought of
death,” he wrote to Bolingbroke, “but now it is never out of my mind,”
139 and he began to long for it. He kept his birthday as a day of
mourning. “No wise man,” he wrote, “ever wished to be younger.” 140 His
regular farewell to his visitors, in these final years, was, “Good
night; I hope I shall never see you again.” 141</p>
<p>Definite symptoms of madness appeared in 1738. In 1741 guardians were
appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of
vio- lence he should do himself harm. In 1742 he suffered great pain
from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of an
egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He
went a whole year without uttering a word. His misery ended on October
19, 1745, in his seventy-eighth year. His will left his fortune, twelve
thousand pounds, to build an insane asylum. He was buried in his own
cathedral, under an epitaph chosen by himself:</p>
<p>Ubi saeva indigmtio</p>
<p>Cor ulterius lacerare nequit</p>
<p>— “where bitter indignation can no longer tear his heart.”</p>
