Greece</h4>
<p>I. THE SOURCES OF POLYTHEISM</p>
<p>W HEN we look for unifying elements in the civilization of these
scat- tered cities we find essentially five; a common language, with
local</p>
<p>dialects; a common intellectual life, in which only major figures in
literature, philosophy, and science are known far beyond their pohtical
frontiers; a common passion for athletics, finding outlet in municipal
and interstate games; a love of beauty locally expressed in forms of art
common to all the Greek communities; and a partly common religious
ritual and belief. Religion divided the cities as much as it united
them. Under the polite and general worship of the remote Olympians lay
the intenser cults of local deities and powers who served no vassalage
to Zeus. Tribal and political separatism nourished polytheism, and made
monotheism impossible. In the early days every family had its own god;
to him the divine fire burned un- extinguished at the hearth, and to him
offerings of food and wine were made before every meal. This holy
communion, or sharing of food with the god, was the basic and primary
act of rehgion in the home. Birth, marriage, and death were sanctified
into sacraments by ancient ritual before the sacred fire; and in this
way rehgion suffused a mystic poetry and a stabilizing solemnity over
the elemental events of human life. In hke manner the gene, the phratry,
the tribe, and the city had each its special god. Athens wor- shiped
Athena, Eleusis Demeter, Samos Hera, Ephesus Artemis, Poseidonia
Poseidon. The center and summit of the city was the shrine of the city
god; participation in the worship of the god was the sign, the
privilege, and the requisite of citizenship. When the city marched out
to war it carried the form and emblem of its god in the forefront of the
troops, and no im- portant step was taken without consulting him through
divination. In re- turn he fought for the city, and sometimes seemed to
appear at the head or above the spears of the soldiers; victory was the
conquest not only of a city by a city but of a god by a god. The city,
like the family or the tribe, kept always burning, at a public altar in
the prytaneum or town hall, a sacred fire symbolizing the mystically
potent and persistent life of the city’s founders</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>176 THE LIFE OE GREECE (CHAP. VHI</p>
<p>and heroes; and periodically the citizens partook of a conunon meal
before this fire. Just as in the family the father was also the priest,
so in the Greek city the chief magistrate or archon was the high priest
of the state religion, and all his powers and actions were sanctified by
the god. By this conscription of the supernatural, man was tamed from a
hunter into a citizen.</p>
<p>Liberated by local independence, the religious imagination of Greece
produced a luxuriant mythology and a populous pantheon. Every object or
force of earth or sky, every blessing and every terror, every quality-
even the vices — of mankind was personified as a deity, usually in human
form; no other religion has ever been so anthropomorphic as the Greek.
Every craft, profession, and art had its divinity, or, as we should say,
its patron saint; and in addition there were demons, harpies, furies,
fairies, gorgons, sirens, nymphs, almost as numerous as the mortals of
the earth. The old question — is religion created by priests? — is here
settled; it is in- credible that any conspiracy of primitive Aeologians
should have begotten such a plethora of gods. It must have been a boon
to have so many deities, so many fascinating legends, sacred shrines,
and solemn or joyous festivals. Polytheism is as natural as polygamy,
and survives as long, suiting well all the contradictory currents of the
world. Even today, in Mediterranean Christianity, it is not God who is
worshiped, so much as the saints; it is polytheism that sheds over the
simple life the inspiring poetry of consola- tory myth, and gives to the
humble soul the aid and comfort that it would not venture to expect from
a Supreme Being unapproachably awful and remote.</p>
<p>Each of the gods had a mythos, or story, attached to him, which
ac-</p>
<p>counted for his place in the city’s life, or for the ritual that
honore d him. These myths, rising spontaneously out of the lore of the
place and the people, or out of the inventions and embellishments of
rhapsodists, became at once the faith and the philosophy, the literature
and the history of the early Greek; from them came the subjects that
adorned Greek vases, and suggested to artists countless paintings,
statues, and reliefs. Despite the achievements of philosophy and the
attempts of a few to preach a mono- theistic creed, the people continued
to the end of Hellenic civilization to create myths, and even gods. Men
like Heracleitus might allegorize the myths, or like Plato adapt them,
or like Xenophanes denounce them; but when Pausanias toured Greece five
centuries after Plato he found still alive among the people the legends
that had warmed the heart of the Homeric age. The mythopoetic,
theopoetic process is natural, and goes on today as</p>
<p>THE GODS OF GREECE</p>

<p>always; there is a birth rate as well as a death rate of the gods;
deity is like energy, and its quantity remains, through all vicissitudes
of form, approxi- mately unchanged from generation to generation.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>AN INVENTORY OF THE GODS</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Lesser Deities</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall force some order and clarity upon this swarm of gods if we
arti- ficially divide them into seven groups: sky-gods, earth-gods,
fertility-gods, ani- mal gods, subterranean gods, ancestor or hero gods,
and Olympians. “The names of all of them,” as Hesiod said, “it were
troublesome for a mortal man to tell.’”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Originally, so far as we can make out, the great god of the
invading Greeks, as of the Vedic Hindus, was the noble and various sky
itself; it was probably this sky-god who with progressing
anthropomorphism became Uranus, or Heaven, and then the “cloud -c
ompelling,” rain -making, thunder-herding Zeus.^ In a land surfeited
with sunshine and hungry for rain, the sun, Helios, was only a minor
deity. Agamemnon prayed to him,® and the Spartans sacrified horses to
him to draw his flaming chariot through the skies;* the Rhodians, in
Hellenistic days, honored Helios as their chief divinity, flung annually
into the sea four horses and a chariot for his use, and dedicated to him
the famous Colossus;* and Anaxagoras almost lost his life, even in
Periclean Athens, for say- ing that the sun was not a god, but only a
ball of fire. Generally, however, there was little worship of the sun in
classic Greece; still less of the moon (Selene); least of all, of the
planets or the stars.</p></li>
<li><p>The earth, not the heavens, was the home of most Greek gods. And
first the earth itself was the goddess Ge or Gaea, patient and bountiful
mother, preg- nant through the embrace of raining Uranus, the sky. A
thousand lesser deities dwelt on the earth, in its waters, or in its
surrounding air: spirits of sacred trees, especially the oak; Nereids,
Naiads, Oceanids, in rivers, lakes, or the sea; gods gushing forth as
wells or springs, or flowing as stately streams like the Maeander or the
Spercheus; gods of the wind, like Boreas, Zephyr, Notus, and Eurus, with
their master Aeolus; or the great god Pan, the horned, cloven-footed,
sensual, smiling Nourisher, god of shepherds and flocks, of woods and
the wild life lurk- ing in them, he whose magic flute could be heard in
every brook and dell, whose startling cry brought panic to any careless
herd, and whose attendants were</p></li>
</ol>
<p>• Phaethon (the Brilliant) , son of Helios, begged for the thrill of
driving the sun’s chariot across the heavens. He drove it recklessly,
nearly set the world on fire, was struck by light- ning, and fell into
the sea. Perhaps the Greeks meant this tale, like that of Icarus, to
serve as a sermon to youth.</p>
<p>178 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VIH</p>
<p>merry fauns and satyrs, and those old satyrs called sileni^ half goat
and half Socrates. Everywhere in nature there were gods; the air was so
crowded with spirits of good or evil that, said an unknown poet, “There
is not one empty chink into which you could push the spike of a blade of
com.”®</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The most mysterious and potent force in nature being reproduction,
it was natural that the Greeks, like other ancient peoples, should
worship the prin- ciple and emblems of fertility in man and woman along
with their worship of fertility in the soil. The phallus, as symbol of
reproduction, appears in the rites of Demeter, Dionysus, Hermes, even of
the chaste Artemis.® In classical sculp- ture and painting this emblem
recurs with scandalous frequency. Even the Great Dionysia, the religious
festival at which the Greek drama was played, was introduced by phallic
processions, to which Athenian colonies piously sent phalli.’^ Doubtless
such festivals lent themselves to much lusty humor, as one may judge
from Aristophanes; but all in all the humor was healthy, and perhaps
served the purpose of stimulating Eros and promoting the birth
rate.®</li>
</ol>
<p>The more vulgar side of this fertility cult was expressed in the
Hellenistic and Roman periods by the worship of Priapus, bom of an amour
between Dionysus and Aphrodite, and popular with vase painters and the
mural artists of Pompeii. A lovelier variation of the reproductive theme
was the veneration of goddesses representing motherhood. Arcadia,
Argos,.Eleusis, Athens, Ephesus, and other localities gave their
greatest devotion to feminine deities, often husbandless; such goddesses
presumably reflect a primitive matrilinear age before the coming of
marriage;® the enthronement of Zeus as Father God over all gods
represents the victory of the patriarchal principle.* The probable
priority of women in agri- culture may have helped to give form to the
greatest of these mother deities. Demeter, goddess of the com or the
tilled earth. One of the most beautiful of Greek myths, skillfully
narrated in the Hymn to Demeter once attributed to Homer, tells how
Demeter’s daughter Persephone, while gathering flowers, was</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Certain animals, in early Greece, were honored as semideities.
Greek religion was too anthropomorphic, in its sculptural age, to admit
the divine menageries that we find in Egypt and India; but a vestige of
a less classical past appears in the frequent association of an animal
with a god. The bull was sacred because of its strength and potency; it
was often an associate, disguise, or symbol of Zeus and Dionysus, and
perhaps preceded them as a god.“ In li ke manner the “cow - eyed Hera”
may once have been a sacred cow.^ The pig too was holy because of its
fertility; it was associated with the gentle Demeter; at one of her
festivals, the Thesmophoria, the sacrifice was ostensibly of a pig,
possibly to it.“ At the feast of the Diasia the sacrifice was nominally
to Zeus, really to a sub- terranean snake that was now dignified with
his name.“ Whether the snake was holy as supposedly deathless, or as a
symbol of reproductive power, we find it passing down as a deity from
the snake-goddess of Crete into fifth-century Athens; in the temple of
Athena, on the Acropolis, a sacred serpent dwelt to whom, each month, a
honey cake was offered in appeasing sacrifice. In Greek art a snake is
often seen about the figures of Hermes, Apollo, and Asclepius;^ under
the shield of Pheidias’ Athene Farthenos was wreathed a mighty serpent;
the Famese Athena is half covered with snakes.“ The snake was often used
as a symbol or form of the guardian deity of temple or home;“ perhaps
because it prowled about tombs it was believed to be the soul of the
dead.“ The Pythian games are thought to have been celebrated, at first,
in honor of the dead python of Delphi.</p></li>
<li><p>The most terrible of the gods were under the earth. In caves and
clefts and like nether chambers dwelt those chthonian or earthly deities
whom the Greeks worshiped not by day with loving adoration, but at night
with apotro- paic rites of riddance and fear. These vague nonhuman
powers were the real autochthonoi of Greece, older than the Hellenes,
older perhaps than the Myce- naeans, who probably transmitted them to
Greece; if we could trace them to their origin we might find that they
were the vengeful spirits of the animals that had been driven into the
forests or under the soil by the advance and multi- plication of men.
The greatest of these subterranean deities was called Zeus Chthonios;
but Zeus here meant merely god.^ Or he was called Zeus Meilichios, the
Benevolent God; but here again the words were deceptive and
propitiatory, for this god was a fearful snake. — Brother to Zeus was
Hades, lord of the under- world that took his name. To placate him the
Greeks called him Pluto, the giver of abundance, for he had it in his
power to bless or blight the roots of all things that grew in the soil.*
Still more ghostly and terrible was Hecate, an evil spirit that came up
from the lower world and brought misfortune, through her evil</p></li>
</ol>
<p>• Plutus, god of wealth, was a form of Pluto. In early Greece wealth
took chiefly the form of com either growing in the earth or stored in
the earth in  ars, in either case under Pluto’s protection.**</p>

<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Before the classical age the dead were regarded as spirits capable
of good and evil to men, and were appeased with offerings and prayer.
They were not quite gods, but the primitive Greek family, like the
Chinese, honored its dead b eyond any deity.” In classical Greece these
vague ghosts were more dreaded than loved, and were propitiated with
aversion rituals, as in the festival of Anthesteria. The worship of
heroes was an extension of the cult of the dead. Great, noble, or
beautiful men or women could be raised by the gods to im- mortal life
and become minor deities. So the people of Olympia offered annual
sacrifice to Hippodameia; Cassandra was worshiped at Laconian Leuctra,
Helen at Sparta, Oedipus at Colonus. Or a god might descend into the
body of a mortal, and transform him with divinity; or the god might
cohabit with a mortal and beget a hero-god, as Zeus with Alcmena begot
Heracles. Many cities, groups, even professions, traced their origin to
some god-born hero; so the physicians of Greece looked back to
Asclepius. The god was once a dead man, ancestor, or hero; the temple
was originally a tomb; the church is still in most lands a shelter for
relics of the sacred dead. In general the Greeks made less distinction
between men and gods than we do; many of their gods were as human,
except in birth, as our saints, and as close to their worshipers; and
though they were called Immortals, some of them, like Dionysus, could
die.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Olympians</li>
</ol>
<p>All these were the less famous, though not necessarily the less
honored, gods of Greece. How is it that we hear so little of them in
Homer, and so much of the Olympians? Probably because the gods of
Olympus entered with the Achaeans and Dorians, overlaid the Mycenaean
and chthonian deities, and conquered them as their worshipers were
conquered. We see the change in action at Dodona and Delphi, where the
older god of the earth, Gaea, was displaced in the one case by Zeus, in
the other by Apollo. The defeated gods were not wiped out; they
remained, so to speak, as sub- ject deities, hiding bitterly
underground, but still revered by the common people, while the
victorious Olympians received on their mountaintop the worship of the
aristocracy; hence Homer, who composed for the elite, says almost
nothing of the nether gods. Homer, Hesiod, and the sculptors helped the
political ascendancy of the conquerors to spread the cult of the
Olympians. Sometimes the minor gods were combined or absorbed into the
greater figures, or became their attendants or satellites, very much as
minor states were now and then attached or subjected to greater ones; so
the satyrs</p>
<p>CHAP.Vm) THE GODS OF GREECE l8l</p>
<p>and sileni were given to Dionysus, the sea nymphs to Poseidon, the
moun- tain and forest sprites to Artemis. The more savage rites and
myths faded out; the chaos of a demon-haunted earth yielded to a
semiorderly divine government that reflected the growing political
stability of the Greek world.</p>
<p>At the head of this new regime was the majestic and patriarchal Zeus.
He was not first in time; Uranus and Cronus, as we have seen, preceded
him; but they and the Titans, like Lucifer’s hosts, were overthrown.*
Zeus and his brothers cast lots to divide the world amongst them; Zeus
won the sky, Poseidon the sea. Hades the bowels of the earth. There is
no creation in this mythology: the world existed before the gods, and
the gods do not make man out of the slime but beget him by union among
themselves, or with their mortal offspring; God is literally the Father
in the theology of the Greeks. Nor are the Olympians omnipotent or
omniscient; each l^ts the other, or even opposes the other; any one of
them, especially Zeus, can be deceived. Nevertheless they acknowledge
his suzerainty, and crowd his court like the retainers of a feudal lord;
and though he consults them on occasion, and now and then yields his
preference to theirs,” he frequently puts them in their place.” He
begins as a sky -and-mountain-god, provider of the indispensable rain.t
Like Yahweh he is, among his earlier forms, a god of war; he debates
with himself whether to end the siege of Troy or “make the war more
bloody,” and decides for the latter course.” Gradually he becomes the
calm and mighty ruler of gods and men, bestriding Olympus in bearded
dignity. He is the head and source of the moral order of the world; he
punishes filial neglect, guards family property, sanctions oaths,
pursues perjurers, and protects boundaries, hearths, suppliants, and
guests. At last he is the serene dispenser of judgment whom Pheidias
carves for Olympia.</p>
<p>His one f ailing is the youthful readiness with which he falls in
love. Not having created women, he admires them as wonderful beings,
bearing even to the gods the inestimable gifts of beauty and tenderness;
and he finds it beyond him to resist them. Hesiod draws up a long list
of the divine amours and their glorious offspring.” His first mate is
Dione, but he leaves her in</p>
<p>• This struggle between Zeus and his aides against the Titans became
for the Greeks a S}nnbol of the conquest of barbarism and brute strength
by civilization and reason, and offered a frequent subject for art.</p>
<p>The name Zeus is probably akin to the Latin dies, our day, and may
come from an Indo- European root di, meaning to shine. Jupiter is
Zeu^ater, leas the father; hence the geni- tive Dios. Today the haunts
and peate once sacred to Zeus are named, or dedicated to, St. FHfls, the
rain-giving saint of the Greek Church.*</p>

<p>Epirus when he moves to Thessalian Olympus. There his first wife is
Metis, goddess of measure, mind, wisdom. Gossip says that her children
will dethrone him; therefore he swallows her, absorbs her qualities, and
be- comes himself the god of wisdom. Metis is delivered of Athena within
him, and his head has to be cut open that Athena may be bom. Lonely for
loveli- ness, he takes Themis for his mate, and begets by her the twelve
Hours; then he takes Eurynome, and begets the three Graces; then
Mnemosyne, and engenders the nine Muses; then Leto, and fathers Apollo
and Artemis; then his sister Demeter, and has Persephone; finally,
having sown his wild oats, he weds his sister Hera, makes her Queen of
Olympus, and receives from her Hebe, Ares, Hephaestus, and Eileithyia.
But he does not get along well with Hera. She is as old a god as he, and
more honored in many states; she is the patron deity of matrimony and
motherhood, protectress of the mar- riage tie; she is prim and grave and
virtuous, and frowns upon his escapades; moreover, she is an excellent
shrew. He thinks of beating her,“ but finds it easier to console himself
with new amours. His first mortal mate is Niobe; his last is Alcmena,
who is descended from Niobe in the sixteenth genera- tion.* He loves
also, with Greek impartiality, the handsome Ganymede, and snatches him
up to be his cupbearer on Olympus.</p>
<p>It was natural that so fertile a father should have some
distinguished chil- dren. When Athena was- bom in full development and
armament from the head of Zeus she provided the literature of the world
with one of its most hackneyed similes. She was an appropriate goddess
for Athens, consoling its maids with her proud virginity, inspiring its
men with martial ardor, and symbolizing for Pericles the wisdom that
belonged to her as the daughter of Metis and Zeus. When Pallas the Titan
tried to make love to her she slew him, and added his name to hers as a
warning to other suitors. To her Athens dedicated its loveliest temple
and its most splendid festival.</p>
<p>More widely worshiped than Athena was her comely brother Apollo,
bright deity of the sun, patron of music, poetry, and art, founder of
cities, maker of laws, god of healing and father of Asclepius, “far
-darting” archer and god of war, successor to Gaea and Phoebef at Delphi
as the holiest oracle of Greece. As god of the growing crops he received
tithe offerings at harvest time, and in return he radiated his golden
warmth and light from Delos and Delphi to enrich the soil. Everywhere he
was associated with order, measure, and beauty; and whereas in other
cults there were strange</p>

<p>elements of fear and superstition, in the worship of Apollo, and in
his great festivals at Delphi and Delos, the dominant note was the
rejoicing of a brilUant people in a god of health and wisdom, reason and
song.</p>
<p>Happy, too, was his sister Artemis (Diana), maiden goddess of the
chase, so absorbed in the ways of animals and the pleasures of the woods
that she had no time for the love of men. She was the goddess of wild
nature, of meadows, forests, hills, and the sacred bough. As Apollo was
the ideal of Greek youth, so Artemis was the model of Greek girlhood —
strong, athletic, graceful, chaste; and yet again she was the patroness
of women in childbirth, who prayed to her to ease their pains. At
Ephesus she kept her Asiatic character as a goddess of motherhood and
fertility. In this way the ideas of virgin and mother became confused in
her worship; and the Chris- tian Church found it wise, in the fifth
century of our era, to attach the rem- nants of this cult to Mary, and
to transform the mid-August harvest festival of Artemis into the feast
of the Assumption.” In such ways the old is pre - served in the new, and
everything changes except the essence. History, like life, must be
continuous or die; character and institutions may be altered, but
slowly; a serious interruption of their development throws them into
national amnesia and insanity.</p>
<p>A thoroughly human figure in this pantheon was the master craftsman
of Olympus, that lame Hephaestus whom the Romans knew as Vulcan. At
first he seems a pitiful and ridiculous figure, this insulted and
injured Quasi- modo of the skies; but in the end our sympathies are with
him rather than with the clever and unscrupulous gods who maltreat him.
Perhaps in early days, before he became so human, he had been the
leaping spirit of the fire and the forge. In the Homeric theogony he is
the son of Zeus and Hera; but ot her myths assure us that Hera, jealous
of Zeus’s unaided deUvery of Athena, gave birth to Hephaestus without
the aid of any male. Seeing him to be ugly and weak, she cast him down
from Olympus. He found his way back, and built for the gods the many
mansions in which they dwelt. Though his mother had dealt so cruelly
with him, he showed her all kind- ness and respect, and defended her so
zealously in one of her quarrels with Zeus that the great Olympian
seized him by the leg and hurled him down to the earth. A whole day
Hephaestus fell; at last he landed on the island of Lemnos, and hurt his
ankle; certainly thereafter (before that, says Homer) he was painfully
lame. Again he found his way back to Olympus. In his resounding
workshops he built a mighty anvil with twenty huge bellows, made the
shield and armor of Achilles, statues that moved of their own accord,
and other very wonderful things. The Greeks worshiped him as</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>he god of all metal trades, then of all handicrafts, and pictured the
vol- canoes as the chimneys of his subterranean forges. It was his
misfortune that he married Aphrodite, for it is difficult for beauty to
be virtuous. Learning of her affair with Ares, Hephaestus fashioned a
trap that fell upon the lovers as they loved; and then the limping deity
had his lame revenge by bringing his fellow gods to look in laughter
upon the bound divinities of love and war. But to Hermes, Homer tells
us, Apollo said;</p>
<p>“Hermes, son of Zeus… wouldst thou in sooth be willing, even</p>
<p>hough ensnared with strong bonds, to lie on a couch by the side</p>
<p>of golden Aphrodite?” Then the messenger answered him: “Would</p>
<p>hat this might befall. Lord Apollo, that thrice as many bonds</p>
<p>inextricable might clasp me about, and that ye gods — aye, and all
the goddesses, too — might be looking on, but that I might sleep by
the</p>
<p>side of golden Aphrodite.”*</p>
<p>Ares (Mars) was never distinguished for intelligence or subtlety;
his</p>
<p>business was war, and even the charms of Aphrodite could not give him
the thrill that came to him from lusty and natural killing. Homer calls
him “the curse of men,” and tells with pleasure how Athena laid him low
with a stone; “he covered, as he lay, seven acres of the field.”” Hermes
(M ercury) is more interesting. In origin he is a stone, and from the
cult of sacred stones his worship is derived; the stages of his
evolution are still visible. Then he is the tall stone placed upon
graves, or he is the daimon, or spirit, in this stone. Then he is the
boundary stone or its god, marking and guard- ing a field; and because
his function there is also to promote fertility, the phallus becomes one
of his symbols. Then he is the herm or pillar — with carved head,
uncarved body, and prominent male member — which was placed before all
respectable houses in Athens;* we shall see how the mutila- tion of
these hermae on the eve of the expedition against Syracuse provided the
proximate cause for the ruin of Alcibiades and Athens. Again he is the
god of wayfarers and the protector of heralds; their characteristic
staff, or caduceus, is one of his favorite insignia. As god of travelers
he becomes a god of luck, trade, cunning, and gain, therefore an
inventor and guarantor of measures and scales, a patron saint of
perjurers, embezzlers, and thieves.* He is himself a herald, bearing the
billets and decrees of Olympus from god to god or man, and he moves on
winged sandals with the speed of an angry wind. His running-about gives
him a lithe and graceful form, and prepares him for Praxiteles. As a
swift and vigorous youth he is the patron saint of athletes, and his
shamelessly virile image has a place in every palaestra.” As</p>
<p>CHAP.Vni) THE GODS OF GREECE 185</p>
<p>herald he is the god of eloquence; as celestial interpreter he is the
first of a long hermeneutical line. One of the “Homeric” Hymns tells
how, in his youth, he stretched strings across a tortoise shell, and so
invented the lyre. Finally it comes his turn to appease Aphrodite; and
their offspring, we are told,“ is a delicate hermaphrodite, sharing
their charms and named from their names.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Greece that in addition to deities of
chastity, vir- ginity, and motherhood it should have a goddess of beauty
and love. Doubt- less in her Near-Eastern origins, and in Cyprus her
half-Oriental home. Aphrodite was first of all a mother goddess; to the
end of her tenure she remained associated with reproduction and
fertility in the whole realm of plant, animal, and human life. But as
civilization developed, and increasing security obviated the need for a
high birth rate, the esthetic sense was left free to see other values in
woman than those of multiplication, and to make Aphrodite not only the
embodiment of the ideal of beauty, but the deity of all heterosexual
pleasure. The Greeks worsliiped her in many forms: as Aphrodite Urania,
the Heavenly, the goddess of chaste or sacred love; as Aphrodite
Pandemos, the Popular, the goddess of profane love in all its modes; and
even as Aphrodite Kallipygos, the Venus of the Lovely Nates.“ At Athens
and Corinth the courtesans built temples to her as their patron saint.
At the beginning of April various cities in Greece celebrated her great
festival, the Aphrodisia; and on that occasion, for those who cared to
take part, sexual freedom was the order of the day.” She was the love
goddess of the sensual and passionate south, ancient rival of Artemis,
the love goddess of the cold and hunting north. Mythology, almost as
ironic as history, made her the wife of the crippled Hephaestus, but she
consoled herself with Ares, Hermes, Poseidon, Dionysus, and many a
mortal like Anchises and Adonis.* To her, in competition with Hera and
Athena, Paris awarded the golden apple as the prize of beauty. But
perhaps she was never really beautiful until Praxiteles reconceived her,
and gave her the loveliness for which Greece could forgive all her
sins.</p>
<p>• The myth of Adonis is one more variation on the vegetation theme—
the annual deadi and resurrection of the soil. This handsome youth was
desired by both Aphrodite and Persephone, the goddesses of love and of
death. Ares, jealous of Adonis’ success with Aphrodite, disguised
himself as a wild boar and killed him. The anemone was bom of A donis’
blood, and rivers of poetry from Aphrodite’s grief. Zeus persuaded the
goddesses to divide Adonis’ time and attentions by leaving him for half
a year with Persephone in Hades, and restoring him for half a year to
earthly life and love. In Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Athens the death of the
boy was commemorated in the festival of the Adonia; women carried images
of the Lord (for such was the meaning of his name), loudly bewailed his
death, and triumphantly celebrated his resurrection.^</p>
<p>l8&lt;$ THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.VHI</p>
<p>To the legitimate or illegitimate children of Zeus we must add, as
major Olympians, his sister Hestia, goddess of the hearth, and his
unruly brother Poseidon. This Greek Neptune, secure in his watery
realms, considered himself fully the equal of Zeus. Even landlocked
nations worshiped him, for he commanded not only the sea but the rivers
and the springs; it was he who guided the mysterious subterranean
streams, and made earthquakes with tidal waves.” To him Greek mariners
pra yed, and raised appeasing temples on perilous promontories.</p>
<p>Subordinate deities were numerous even on Olympus, for there was no
end to personifications. There was Hestia (the Roman Vesta), goddess of
the hearth and its sacred fire. There was Iris, the rainbow, sometimes
messenger for Zeus; Hebe, goddess of youth; Eileithyia, who helped women
in childbirth; Dike or Justice; Tyche, Chance; and Eros, Love, whom</p>
<p>Hesiod made the creator of the world, whom Sappho called “a limb
-dis- solving, bitter-sweet , impracticable wild beast.”“ There was
Hymeneus, the Marriage Song; Hypnos, Sleep; Oneiros, Dream; Geras, Old
Age; Lethe, Oblivion; Thanatos, Death, and others beyond naming. There
were nine Muses to inspire artists and poets: Clio for history, Euterpe
for lyric poetry accompanied by the flute, Thalia for comic drama and
idyllic poetry, Melpomene for tragedy, Terpsichore for choral dance and
song, Erato for love verse and mimicry; Polymnia for hymns, Urania for
astronomy. Cal- liope for epic poetry. There were three Graces, and
their twelve attendants, the Hours. There was Nemesis, who meted out
good and evil to men, and visited with disaster all who were guilty of
insolence in prosperity.</p>
<p>There were the terrible Erinnyes, the Furies who left no wrong
un-</p>
<p>revenged; the Greeks with deprecating euphemism called them Well-
Wishers, Eumenides. And fin^y there were the Moirai, the Fates or</p>
<p>Allotters who regulated inevitably the affairs of life, and ruled,
some said, both gods and men. In that conception Greek religion found
its Kmit, and flowed over into science and law.</p>
<p>We have left for the last the most troublesome, the most popular, the
most difficult to classify, of all the Greek gods. Only late in his
career was Dionysus received into Olympus. In Thrace, which gave him as
a Greek gift to Greece, he was the god of liquor brewed from barley, and
was known as Sabazius; in Greece he became a god of wine, the nourisher
and guardian of the vine; he began as a goddess of fertility, became a
god of intoxication, and ended as a son of god dying to save mankind.
Many figures and legends were mingled to make his myth. The Greeks
thought of him as</p>
<p>THE GODS OF GREECE.</p>
<p>CHAP, vin)</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>Zagreus, “the homed child” home to Zeus by his daughte r Persephone.
He was the best beloved of his father, and was seated beside him on the
throne of heaven. When the jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill him,
Zeus, to disguise him, changed him into a goat, then a bull; in this
form, nevertheless, the Titans captured him, cut his body into pieces,
and boiled them in a caldron. Athena, like another Trelawney, saved the
heart, and carried it to Zeus; Zeus gave it to Semele, who, impregnated
with it, gave to the god a second birth under the name of Dionysus.*</p>
<p>Mourning for Dionysus’ death, and joyful celebration of his
resurrection, formed the basis of a ritual extremely widespread among
the Greeks. In springtime, when the vine was bursting into blossom,
Greek women went up into the hills to meet the reborn god. For two days
they drank without restraint, and like our less reUgious bacchanalians,
considered him witless who would not lose his wits. They marched in wild
procession, led by Maenads, or mad women, devoted to Dionysus; they
listened tensely to the story they knew so well, of the suffering,
death, and resurrection of their god; and as they drank and danced they
fell into a frenzy in which all bonds were loosed. The height and center
of their ceremony was to seize upon a goat, a bull, sometimes a man
(seeing in them incarnations of the god) ; to tear the live victim to
pieces in commemoration of Dionysus’ dismember - ment; then to drink the
blood and eat the flesh in a sacred communion whereby, as they thought,
the god would enter them and possess their souls. In that divine
enthusiasmf they were convinced that they and the god be- came one in a
mystic and triumphant union; they took his name, called themselves,
after one of his titles, Bacchoi, and knew that now they would never
die. Or they termed their state an ecstasis, a going out of their souls
to meet and be one with Dionysus; thus they felt freed from the burden
of the flesh, they acquired divine insight, they were able to prophesy,
they were gods. Such was the passionate cult that came down from Thrace
into Greece like a medieval epidemic of religion, dragging one region
after another from the cold and clear Olympians of the state worship
into a faith and ritual that satisfied the craving for excitement and
release, the longing for enthusiasm and possession, mysticism and
mystery. The priests of</p>
<p>• Diodorus Siculus, as early as 50 b.c., interpreted the tale as a
vegetation myth. Zagreus, the vine, is a child of Demeter, the earth,
fertilized by Zeus, the rain. The vine, like the god, is cut (pruned) to
give it new life; and the juice of the grape is boiled to make wine.
Each year, under nourishing rains, the vine is reborn.“ Herodotus found
so many resemblances between the myths of Dionysus and Osiris that he
identified the two gods in one of the first essays in comparative
religion.“</p>
<p>From entheoSy “a god within”; “enthusiasm” originally meant
possession by a god.</p>
<p>i88</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>Delphi and the rulers of Athens tried to keep the cult at a distance,
but failed; all they could do was to adopt Dionysus into Olympus,
Hellenize and humanize him, give him an official festival, and turn the
revelry of his worshipers from the mad ecstasy of wine among the hills
into the stately processions, the robust songs, and the noble drama of
the Great Dionysia. For a while they won Dionysus over to Apollo, but in
the end Apollo yielded to Dionysus’ heir and conqueror, Christ.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>MYSTERIES</li>
</ol>
<p>There were essentially three elements and stages in Greek religion:
chthonian, Olympian, and mystic. The first was probably of
Pelasgo-Mycenaean origin, the second probably Achaeo-Dorian, the third
Egypto- Asiatic. The first wor- shiped subterranean, the second
celestial, the third resurrected, gods. The first was most popular among
the poor, the second among the well to do, the third in the lower middle
class. The first predominated before the Homeric age, the second in it,
the third after it. By the time of the Periclean Enlight- enment the
most vigorous element in Greek religion was the mystery. In the Greek
sense a mystery was a secret ceremony in which sacred symbols were
revealed, symbolic rites were performed, and only initiates were the
wor- shipers. Usually the rites represented or commemorated, in
semidramatic form, the suffering, death, and resurrection of a god,
pointed back to old vegetation themes and magic, and promised the
initiate a personal immortality.</p>
<p>Many places in Greece celebrated such mystic rites, but no other
place in this respect could rival Eleusis. The mysteries there were of
pre-Achaean origin, and appear to have been originally an autumn
festival of plowing and sowing.“ A myth explained how Demeter, rewarding
the people of Attica for their l^dness to her in her wanderings,
established at Eleusis her greatest tem- ple, which was destroyed and
rebuilt many times during the history of Greece. Under Solon,
Peisistratus, and Pericles the festival of Demeter at Eleusis was
adopted by Athens, and raised to higher elaboration and pomp. In the
Lesser Mysteries, held near Athens in the spring, candidates for
initiation underwent a preliminary purification by self-immersion in the
waters of the Ilissus. In Sep- tember the candidates and others walked
in grave but happy pilgrimage for fourteen miles along the Sacred Way to
Eleusis, bearing at their head the image of the chthonian deity lacchus.
The procession arrived at Eleusis under torchlight, and solemnly placed
the image in the temple; after which the day was ended with sacred
dances and songs.</p>
<p>The Greater Mysteries lasted four days more. Those who had been
purified with bathing and fasting were now admitted to the lesser rites;
those who had</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) THE GODS OF GREECE 189</p>
<p>received such rites a year before were taken into the Hall of
Initiation, where the secret ceremony was performed. The mystai^ or
initiates, broke their fast by participating in a holy communion in
memory of Demeter, drinking a holy mixture of meal and water, and eating
sacred cakes. What mystic ritual was then performed we do not know; the
secret was well kept throughout antiquity, under penalty of death; even
the pious Aeschylus narrowly escaped condem- nation for certain lines
that might have given the secret away. The ceremony was in any case a
symbolic play, and had a part in generating the Dionysian drama. Very
probably the theme was the rape of Persephone by Pluto, the sorrowful
wandering of Demeter, the return of the Maiden to earth, and the
revelation of agriculture to Attica. The summary of the ceremony was the
mystic marriage of a priest representing Zeus with a priestess
impersonating Demeter. These symbolic nuptials bore fruit with magic
speed, for it was soon followed, we are told, by a solemn announcement
that “Ou r Lady has borne a holy boy”; and a reaped ear of corn was
exhibited as symbolizing the fruit of Demeter’s labor— the bounty of the
fields. The worshipers were then led by dim torchlight into dark
subterranean caverns symbolizing Hades, and, again, to an upper chamber
brilliant with light, representing, it appears, the abode of the
blessed; and they were now shown, in solemn exaltation, the holy
objects, relics, or icons that till that moment had been concealed. In
this ecstasy of revelation, we are assured, they felt the unity of God,
and the oneness of God and the soul; they were lifted up out of the
delusion of individuality, and knew the peace of absorption into
deity.“</p>
<p>In the age of Peisistratus the mysteries of Dionysus entered into the
Eleu- sinian liturgy by a religious infection: the god lacchus was
identified with Dionysus as the son of Persephone, and the legend of
Dionysus Zagreus was superimposed upon the myth of Demeter.“ But through
all forms the basic idea of the mysteries remained the same: as the seed
is bom again, so may the dead have renewed life; and not merely the
dreary, shadowy existence of Hades, but a life of happiness and peace.
When almost everything else in Greek religion had passed away, this
consoling hope, reunited in Alexandria with that Egyptian belief in
immortality from which the Greek had been derived, gave to Christianity
the weapon with which to conquer the Western world.</p>
<p>In the seventh century there came into Hellas, from Egypt, Thrace,
and Thessaly, another mystic cult, even more important in Greek history
than the mysteries of Eleusis. At its source we find, in the age of the
Argonauts, the obscure but fascinating figure of Orpheus, a Thracian who
“in culture, music, and poetry,” says Diodorus, “far surpassed all men
of whom we have a record.”’® Very probably he existed, though all that
we now know of him bears the marks of myth. He is pictured as a gentle
spirit, tender, medi-</p>
<p>Ipo</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF T5EEECE</p>
<p>(chap. VHI</p>
<p>ative, aflFectionate; sometimes a musician, sometimes a reforming
ascetic priest of Dionysus. He played the lyre so well, and sang to it
so melodi- ously, that those who heard him almost began to worship him
as a god; wild animals became tame at his voice, and trees and rocks
left their places to follow the sound of his harp. He married the fair
Eurydice, and almost went mad when death took her. He plunged into
Hades, charmed Perseph- one with his lyre, and was allowed to lead
Eurydice up to life again on condition that he should not look back upon
her until the surface of the earth was reached. At the last barrier
anxiety overcame him lest she should no longer be following; he looked
back, only to see her snatched down once more into the nether world.
Thracian women, resenting his unwillingness 1 0 console himself with
them, tore him to pieces in one of their Dionysian revels; Zeus atoned
for them by placing the lyre of Orpheus as a constella- tion among the
stars. The severed head, stUl singing, was buried at Lesbos in a cleft
that became the site of a popular oracle; there, we are told, the
nightingales sang with especial tenderness.“</p>
<p>In later days it was claimed that he had left behind him many sacred
songs; and perhaps it was so. At the behest of Hipparchus, says Greek
tradition, a scholar named Onomacritus, about 520, edited these as the
Homeric lays had been edited a generation before. In the sixth century,
or earlier, these hymns had acquired a sacred character as divinely
inspired, and formed the basis of a mystical cult related to that of
Dionysus but far superior to it in doctrine, ritual, and moral
influence. The creed was essen- tially an afliirmation of the passion
(suffering), death, and resurrection of the divine son Dionysus Zagreus,
and the resurrection of all men into a future of reward and punishment.
Since the Titans, who had slain Diony- sus, were believed to have been
the ancestors of man, a taint of original sin rested upon all humanity;
and in punishment for this the soul was enclosed in the body as in a
prison or a tomb. But man might console himself by knowing that the
Titans had eaten Dionysus, and that therefore every man harbored, in his
soul, a particle of indestructible divinity. In a mystic sacra- ment of
communion the Orphic worshipers ate the raw flesh of a bull as a symbol
of Dionysus to commemorate the slaying and eating of the god, and to
absorb the divine essence anew.“</p>
<p>After death, said Orphic theology, the soul goes down to Hades, and
must face judgment by the gods of the underworld; the Orphic hymns and
ritual, like the Egyptian Book of the Dead, instructed the faithful in
the art of preparing for this comprehensive and final examination. If
the ver- dict was guilty there would be severe punishment. One form of
the doctrine</p>
<p>CHAP.Vin) THE GODS OF GREECE I9I</p>
<p>conceived this punishment as eternal,“ and transmitted to later
theology the notion of hell. Another form adopted the idea of
transmigration: the soul was reborn again and again into lives happier
or bitterer than before accord- ing to the purity or impurity of its
former existence; and this wheel of rebirth would turn until complete
purity was achieved, and the soul was admitted to the Islands of the
Blest.“ Another variant offered hope that the punishment in Hades might
be ended through penances performed in advance by the individual, or,
after his death, by his friends. In this way a doctrine of purgatory and
indulgences arose; and Plato describes with almost the anger of a Luther
the peddling of such indulgences in the Athens of the fourth century
b.c.:</p>
<p>Mendicant prophets go to rich men’s doors and persuade them</p>
<p>hat they have a power committed to them of making atonement for their
sins or those of their fathers by sacrifices or charms…. And</p>
<p>hey produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus…</p>
<p>according to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only
individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements may be made
by sacrifices and amusements [ceremonies?] which fill a vacant hour, and
are equally at the service of the living and the dead. The</p>
<p>latter [ceremonies] they call mysteries, and these redeem us from</p>
<p>he Pains of Hell; but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits</p>
<p>us.“</p>
<p>Nevertheless there were in Orphism idealistic trends that culminated
in the morals and monasticism of Christianity. The reckless looseness of
the Olympians was replaced by a strict code of conduct, and the mighty
Zeus was slowly dethroned by the gentle figure of Orpheus, even as
Yahweh was to be dethroned by Christ. A conception of sin and
conscience, a dualistic view of the body as evil and of the soul as
divine, entered into Greek thought; the subjugation of the flesh became
a main purpose of religion, as a condition of the release for the soul.
The brotherhood of Orphic initiates had no ecclesiastical organization
and no separate life; but they were dis- tinguished by the wearing of
white garments, the avoidance of flesh food, and a degree of asceticism
not usually associated with Hellenic ways. They represented, in several
aspects, a Puritan Reformation in the history of Greece. Their rites
encroached more and more upon the public worship of the Olympian
gods.</p>
<p>The influence of the sect was extensive and enduring. Perhaps it was
here that the Pythagoreans took their diet, their dress, and their
theory of</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap, vra</p>
<p>ransmigration; it is worthy of note that the oldest Orphic documents
now extant were found in southern Italy Plato, though he rejected much
in Orphism, accepted its opposition of body and soul, its puritan
tendency, its hope of immortality. Part of the pantheism and asceticism
of Stoicism may be traced to an Orphic origin. The Neo-Platonists of
Alexandria pos- sessed a large collection of Orphic writings, and based
upon them much of their theology and their mysticism. The doctrines of
hell, purgatory, and’ heaven, of the body versus the soul, of the divine
son slain and reborn, as well as the sacramental eating of the body and
blood and divinity of the god, directly or deviously influenced
Christianity, which was itself a mys- tery religion of atonement and
hope, of mystic union and release. The basic ideas and ritual of the
Orphic cult are alive and flourishing amongst us today.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>WORSHIP</li>
</ol>
<p>Greek ritual was as varied as the kinds of deities that it honored.
The chthonian gods received a gloomy ritual of appeasement and riddance,
the Olympians a joyful ritual of welcome and praise. Neither form of
cere- mony required a clergyman: the father acted as priest for the
family, the chief magistrate for the state. Life in Greece was not as
secular as it has been described; religion played a major part in it
everywhere, and each government protected the official cult as vital to
social order and political stability. But whereas in Egypt and the Near
East the priesthood dominated the state, in Greece the state dominated
the priesthood, took the leader- ship of religion, and reduced the
clergy to minor functionaries in the tem- ples. The property of the
temples, in real estate, money, and slaves, was audited and administered
by officials of the state.” There were no sem - inaries for the training
of priests; anyone could be quietly chosen or ap- pointed priest if he
knew the rites of the god; and in many places the office was let out to
the highest bidder.” There was no hierarchy of priestly caste; the
priests of one temple or state had usually no association with those of
another.” There was no church, no orthodoxy, no rigid creed; religion
con- sisted not in professing certain beliefs, but in joining in the
official ritual;“ any man might have his own creed provided that he did
not openly deny or blaspheme the city’s gods. In Greece churc h and
state were one.</p>
<p>The place of worship could be the domestic hearth, the municipal
hearth in the city hall, some cleft in the earth for a chthonian deity,
some temple for an Olympian god. The precincts of the temple were sacred
and</p>
<p>CHAP. VIll) THE GODS OF GREECE 193</p>
<p>inviolable; here the worshipers met, and here all pursued persons,
even if tainted with serious crime, could find sanctuary. The temple was
not for the congregation but for the god; there, in his home, his statue
was erected, and a light burned before it which was not allowed to die.
Often the peo- ple identified the god with the statue; they washed,
dressed, and tended the image carefully, and sometimes scolded it for
negligence; they told how, at various times, the statue had sweated, or
wept, or closed its eyes.“ In the temple records a history was kept of
the festivals of the god, and of the major events in the life of the
city or group that worshiped him; this was the source and first form of
Greek historiography.</p>
<p>The ceremony consisted of procession, chants, sacrifice, prayer, and
sometimes a sacred meal. Magic and masquerade, tableaux and dramatic
representations might be part of the procession. In most cases the basic
ritual was prescribed by custom, and every movement of it, every word of
the hymns and prayers, was preserved in a book kept sacred by the family
or the state; rarely was any syllable or action altered, or any rhythm;
the god might not like or comprehend the novelty. The living speech
changed, the ritual speech remained as before; in time the worshipers
ceased to understand the words they used,“ but the thrill of antiquity
supplied the place of understanding. Often the ceremony outlasted even
the memory of the cause that had prompted it; then new myths were
invented to explain its establishment: the myth or creed might change,
but not the ritual. Music was essential to the whole process, for
without music religion would be diflicult; music generates religion as
much as religion generates music. Out of the temple and processional
chants came poetry, and the meters that later adorned the robust
profanity of Archilochus, the reckless passion of Sappho, and the
scandalous delicacies of Anacreon.</p>
<p>Having reached the altar — usually in front of the temple — the
worshipers sought with sacrifice and prayer to avert the wrath or win
the aid of their god. As individuals they might offer almost anything of
value — statues, re- liefs, furniture, weapons, caldrons, tripods,
garments, pottery; when the gods could make no use of such articles the
priests could. Armies might offer part of their spoils, as Xenophon’s
Ten Thousand did in their retreat.“</p>

<p>sacrificed Persian captives to Dionysus at the battle of Salamis;”
the Spar - tans celebrated the festival of Artemis Orthia by flogging
youths, some- times to death, at her altar;” in Arcadia Zeus received
human sacrifice till the second century a.d.;“ at Massalia, in time of
pestilence, one of the poorer citizens was fed at public expense, clad
in holy garments, decorated with sacred boughs, and cast over a cliff to
death with prayers that he might bear punishment for all the sins of his
people.” In Athens it was the cus - tom, in famine, plague, or other
crisis, to offer to the gods, in ritual mimicry or in actual fact, one
or more scapegoats for the purification of the city; and a similar rite,
mimic or literal, was annually performed at the festival of the
Thargelia.*” In the course of time human sacrifice was mitigated</p>
<p>Animal sacrifice, then, was a major step in the development of
civilization. The beasts who bore the brunt of this advance in Greece
were the bull, the sheep, and the pig. Before any battle the rival
armies sent up sacrifices in proportion to their desired victory; before
any assembly in Athens the meeting place was purified by the sacrifice
of a pig. The piety of the peo- ple, however, broke down at the crucial
point: only the bones and a little flesh, wrapped in fat, went to the
god; the rest was kept for the priests and the worshipers. To excuse
themselves the Greeks told how, in the days of the giants, Prometheus
had wrapped the edible portions of the sacri- ficial animal in skin, and
the bones in fat, and had asked Zeus to choose which he preferred. Zeus
had “with both hands” chosen the fat. It was true that Zeus was enraged
upon finding that he had been deceived; but he had made his choice, and
must abide by it forever.” Only in sacrifice to the chthonian gods was
everything surrendered to the deity, and the entire animal bumt to ashes
in a holocaust; the divinities of the lower world were</p>

originally magicians; pharmakon meant a magic spell or formula, then a
healing drug.“ The question whether the pharmakoi were really slain is
in dispute; but there is little doubt that the sacrifice was originally

<p>more feared than those of Olympus. No common meal followed a chthonic
sacrifice, for that might tempt the god to come and join the feast. But
after sacrifice to the Olympians the worshipers, not in awed atonement
to the god but in joyous communion with him, consumed the consecrated
victim; the magic formulas pronounced over it had, they hoped, imbued it
with the life and power of the god, which would now pass mystically into
his communicants. In like manner wine was poured upon the sacrifice, and
then into the cups of the worshipers, who drank, so to speak, with the
gods.** In the thiasoi, or fraternities, into which so many trade and
social groups in Athens were organized, this idea of divine communion in
a com- mon religious meal formed the binding tie.“</p>
<p>Animal sacrifice continued throughout Greece until ended by
Chris-</p>
<p>ianity,™ which wisely substituted for it the spiritual and symbolical
sacri - fice of the Mass. In some measure prayer too became a substitute
for sacrifice; it was a clever amendment that commuted offerings of
blood into litanies of praise. In this gentler way man, subject to
chance and tragedy at every step, consoled and strengthened himself by
calling to his aid the mysterious powers of the world.</p>
<p>V. SUPERSTITIONS</p>
<p>Between these upper and nether poles of Greek religion, the Olympian
and the subterranean, surged an ocean of magic, superstition, and
sorcery; behind and below the geniuses whom we shall celebrate were
masses of people poor and simple, to whom religion was a mesh of fears
rather than a ladder of hope. It was not merely that the average Greek
accepted miracle stories — of Theseus rising from the dead to fight at
Marathon, or of Dionysus changing water into wine:™ such stories appear
among every people, and are part of the forgivable poetry with which
imagination brightens the common life. One could even pass over the
anxiety of Athens to secure the bones of Theseus, and of Sparta to bring
back from Tegea the bones of Orestes;“ the miraculous power ofiicially
attributed to these relics may well have been part of the technique of
rule. What oppressed the pious Greek was the cloud of spirits that
surrounded him, ready and able, he believed, to spy upon him, interfere
with him, and do him eviL These demons were always seeking to enter into
him; he had to be on his guard against them at all times, and to perform
magical ceremonies to dis- perse them.</p>
<p>This superstition verged on science, and in some measure forecast our
germ theory of disease. All sickness, to the Greek, meant possession by
an alien</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>spirit; to touch a sick person was to contract his uncleanliness or
“possession”; our bacilli and bacteria are the currently fashionable
forms of what the Greeks called keres or little demons.^ So a dead
person was “unclean”; the keres had gotten him once for all. When the
Greek left a house where a corpse lay, he sprinkled himself with water,
from a vessel placed for such purposes at the door, to drive away from
himself the spirit that had conquered the dead man.’® This conception
was extended to many realms where even our bacteriophobia would hardly
apply it. Sexual intercourse rendered a person unclean; so did birth,
childbirth, and homicide (even if unintentional). Madness was posses-
sion by an alien spirit; the madman was “beside himself.” In all these
cases a ceremony of purification was considered necessary. Periodically
homes, tem- ples, camps, even whole cities were purified, and very much
as we disinfect them — by water, smoke, or fire.’’ A bowl of clean water
stood at the entrance</p>
<p>Out of this belief in an enveloping atmosphere of spirits came a
thousand superstitions, which Theophrastus, successor to Aristotle,
summarized in one of his Characters:</p>
<p>Superstitiousness would seem to be a sort of cowardice with re-</p>
<p>spect to the divine…. Your Superstitious Man will not sally forth</p>
<p>for the day till he have washed his hands and sprinkled himself at
the Nine Springs, and put a bit of bay-leaf from a temple in his
mouth.</p>
<p>And if a cat cross his path he will not proceed on his way till
some</p>
<p>one else be gone by, or he have cast three stones across the
street.</p>
<p>Should he espy a snake in his house, if it be one of the red sort
he</p>
<p>will call upon Dionysus; if it be a sacred snake he will build a
shrine</p>
<p>hen and there. When he passes one of the smooth stones set up at
crossroads he anoints it with oil from his flask, and will not go
his</p>
<p>ways till he have knelt down and worshiped it. If a mouse gnaw a</p>
<p>bag of his meal, he will off to the wizard and ask what he must
do;</p>
<p>and if the advice be, “Send the bag to the cobblers to be
patched,”</p>
<p>he neglects the advice and frees himself of the ill by rites of
aversion.</p>

<p>CHAP.Vra)</p>
<p>… If he catches sight of a madman or an epileptic, he shudders
and</p>
<p>spits into his bosom.®</p>
<p>The simpler Greeks believed, or taught their children to believe, in
a great variety of bogies. Whole cities were disturbed, at short
intervals, by “portents” or strange occurrences, like deformed births of
animals or men.® The belief in unlucky days was so widespread that on
such days no marriage might take place, no assembly might be held, no
courts might meet, no enterprise might begin. A sneeze, a stumble, might
be reason for abandoning a trip or an under- taking; a minor eclipse
could stop or turn back armies, and bring great wars to a disastrous
end. Again, there were persons gifted with the power of effective
cursing: an angered parent, a neglected beggar might lay upon one a
curse that would ruin one’s life. Some persons possessed magic arts;
they could mix love philters or aphrodisiacs, and could by secret drugs
reduce a man to impotence or a woman to sterility.® Plato did not
consider his Laws complete without an enactment against those who injure
or slay by magic arts.” Witches are not medieval inventions; note
Euripides’ Medea, and Theocritus’ Simaetha. Superstition is one of the
most stable of social phenomena; it re- mains almost unchanged through
centuries and civilizations, not only in its bases but even in its
formulas.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ORACLES</li>
</ol>
<p>In a world so crowded with supernatural powers, the events of life
seemed to depend upon the will of demons and gods. To discover that will
the curious Greeks consulted soothsayers and oracles, who divined the
future by reading the stars, interpreting dreams, examining the entrails
of animals, or observing the flight of birds. Professional soothsayers
hired themselves out to families, armies, and states;” Nicias, before
setting out upon the expedition to Sicily, engaged a troop of
sacrificers, augurs, diviners;” and though not all generals were as
pious as this great slaveowner, nearly all were as superstitious. Men
and women appeared who claimed inspiration and clairvoyance; in Ionia
particularly certain women called Sibyls (i.e., the Will of God) issued
oracles believed by millions of Greeks.” From Erythrae the Sibyl
Herophila was said to have wandered through Greece to Cumae in Italy,
where she became the most famous of her kind, and lived, we are told, a
thousand years. Athens, like Rome, had a collection of ancient oracles,
and the government maintained in the prytaneum men skilled in their
interpretation.”</p>
<p>Public oracles were set up at many temples in all parts of Greece;
but the most famous and honored were in early days the oracle of Zeus
at</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>Dodona, and in the historical period that of Apollo at Delphi.
“Barbarians” as well as Greeks consulted this oracle; even Rome sent
messengers to ask or suggest the will of the god. Since the power of
divination was supposed to belong particularly to the intuitive sex,
three priestesses, each at least half a century old, were trained to
consult Apollo through the medium of a trance. From a hollow in the
earth below the temple came a peculiar gas, ascribed to the eternal
decomposition of the python that Apollo had slain there; the officiating
priestess, called Pythia, took her seat on a high tripod over this
cleft, inhaled the divine stench, chewed narcotic laurel leaves, fell
into delirium and convulsions, and, thus inspired, uttered in- coherent
words which the priests translated to the people. Very often the final
reply admitted of diverse, even contrary, interpretations, so that the
infallibility of the oracle was maintained whatever the event.” Possibly
the priests were no less puppets than the priestesses; sometimes they
accepted bribes;” and in most cases the voice of the oracle harmonized
melodiously with the dominant influence in Greece.“ Nevertheless, where
external pow- ers did not constrain them, the priests taught valuable
lessons of moderation and political wisdom to the Greeks. Though they
condoned human sac- rifice even after the moral sense of Greece had
begun to revolt against it, and made no protest against the immoralities
of Olympus, they aided the establishment of law, encouraged the
manumission of slaves, and bought many slaves in order to give them
liberty.“ They were not in advance of Greek thought, but they did not
hinder it by doctrinal intolerance. They gave a helpful supernatural
sanction to necessary Greek policies, and pro- vided some degree of
international conscience and moral unity for the scat- tered cities of
Greece.</p>
<p>Out of this unifying influence came the oldest known confederation of
Greek states. The Amphictyonic League was originally the religious alli-
ance of the peoples “dwelling around” the sanctuary of Demeter near Ther
- mopylae. The chief constituent states were Thessaly, Magnesia,
Phthiotis, Doris, Phocis, Boeotia, Euboea, and Achaea. They met
semiannually, in spring at Delphi, in autumn at Thermopylae. They bound
themselves never to destroy one another’s cities, never to allow the
water supply of any member city to be shut off, never to plunder — or
permit to be plundered — the treasury of Apollo at Delphi, and to attack
any nation that violated these pledges. Here was the outline of a League
of Nations; an outline whose completion was prevented by the natural
fluctuations of wealth and power among states, and the inherent
rivalries of men and groups. Thessaly formed a bloc of vassal states,
and permanently dominated the League.”</p>
<p>CHAP.Vm) THE GODS OF GREECE 199</p>
<p>Other amphictyonies were established; Athens, for example, belonged
to the Amphictyony of Calauria; and the rival leagues, while promoting
peace within their membership, became against other groups vast
instruments of intrigue and war.</p>
<p>vn. FESTIVALS</p>
<p>If it could not end war Greek religion succeeded in alleviating the
routine of economic life with numerous festivals. “How many victims
offered to the gods!” cried Aristophanes; “how many temples, statues…
sacred pro - cessions! At every moment of the year we see religious
feasts and gar- landed victims” of sacrifice.^ The rich paid the cost,
the state provided the</p>
<p>The calendar at Athens was essentially a religious calendar, and many
months were named from their religious festivals. In the first month,
Hecatombaion (July- August), came the Cronia (corresponding to the Roman
Saturnalia), when masters and slaves sat down together to a joyful
feast; in the same month, every fourth year, occurred the Panathenaea,
when, after four days of varied contests and games, the entire
citizenship formed a solemn and colorful pro- cession to carry to the
priestess of Athena the sacred peplos, a gorgeously embroidered robe
which was to be placed upon the image of the city’s god - dess; this, as
all the world knows, was the theme that Pheidias chose for the frieze of
the Parthenon. In the second month, Metageitnion, came the Meta-
geitnia, a minor festival in honor of Apollo. In the third month,
Boedromion, Athens sallied forth to Eleusis for the Greater Mysteries.
The fourth month, Pyanepsion, celebrated the Pyanepsia, the Oscophoria,
and the Thesmophoria; in this the women of Athens honored Demeter
Thesmophoros (the Lawgiver) with a strange chthonian ritual, parading
phallic emblems, exchanging obsceni- ties, and symbolically going down
to Hades and returning, apparently as magi- cal ceremonies to promote
fertility in the soil and man.®* Only the month of Maimakterion had no
festival.</p>
<p>In the month of Poseideon Athens held the Italoa, a feast of first
fruits; in Gamelion the Lenaea, in honor of Dionysus. In Anthesterion
came three important celebrations: the Lesser or preparatory Mysteries;
the Diasia, or sac- rifice to Zeus Meilichios; and, above all, the
Anthesteria, or Feast of Flowers. In this three-day spring festival to
Dionysus wine flowed freely, and every- body was more or less drunk;*
there was a competition in wine drinking, and the streets were alive
with revelry. The king- archon’s wife rode on a car be - side the image
of Dionysus, and was married to it in the temple as a symbol</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>of the union of the god with Athens. Beneath this jolly ritual ran a
somber undertone of fear and propitiation of the dead; the living ate a
solemn meal in commemoration of their ancestors, and left for them pots
full of food and drink. At the end of the feast the people chased the
spirits of the departed from the house with a formula of exorcism: “Out
of the door with you, souls! Anthesteria is over”— words that became a
proverbial phrase for dismissing importunate beggars.*</p>
<p>In the ninth month, Elaphebolion, came the Great Dionysia,
established by Peisistratus in 534; in that year Thespis inaugurated the
drama at Athens as part of the festival. It was the end of March, spring
was in the air, the sea was navigable, merchants and visitors crowded
the city and swelled the attendance at the ceremonies and the plays. All
business was suspended, all courts were closed; prisoners were released
to let them share in the festivities. Athenians of every age and class,
brilliantly attired, took part in the procession that brought the statue
of Dionysus from Eleutherae and placed it in his theater. The rich drove
chariots, the poor marched on foot; a long train of animals followed as
destined gifts for the gods. Choruses from the towns of Attica joined or
competed in song and dance. — In the tenth month, Munychion, Athens
cele- brated the Munychia, and Attica, every fifth year, celebrated the
Brauronia in honor of Artemis. In Thargelion occurred the Thargelia, or
feast of the grain harvest. In the twelfth month, Skirophorion, came the
festivals of Skiro- phoria, Arretophoria, Dipolia, and Bouphonia. Not
all these feasts were annual; but even for a four-year period they
represented a grateful relief from daily toil.</p>
<p>Other states had similar holidays; and in the countryside every
sowing and every harvest was greeted with festal conviviality. Greater
than all these were the Panhellenic festivals, the panegyreis^ or
universal gatherings. There were the Panionia on Mycale, the feast of
Apollo at Delos, the Pythian festival at Delphi, the Isthmian at
Corinth, the Nemean near Argos, the Olympic in Elis. These were the
occasions of interstate games, but basically they were holydays. It was
the good fortune of Greece to have a religion human enough — in later
days humane enough — to associate itself joyfully and creatively with
art, poetry, music, and games, even, at last, with morality.</p>
<p>vni. RELIGION AND MORALS</p>
<p>At first sight Greek religion does not seem to have been a major
influ- ence for morality. It was in origin a system of magic rather than
of ethics, and remained so, in large measure, to the end; correct ritual
received more</p>
<p>• In many parts of Eu rope the people still believe that the ghosts
of the dead return to earth yearly, and must be entertained in a “Feast
of All Souls</p>
<p>CHAP.Vm) THE GODS OF GREECE 201</p>
<p>emphasis than good conduct, and the gods themselves, on Olympus or on
earth, had not been exemplars of honesty, chastity, or gentleness. Even
the Eleusinian Mysteries, though they offered supernatural hopes, made
salvation depend upon ritual purifications rather than upon nobility of
life. “Pataikion the thief,” said the sarcastic Diogenes, “will have a
better fate after his death than Agesilaus or Epaminondas, for Pataikion
has been initiated at Eleusis.”“ &gt;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the more vital moral relations Greek religion
came</p>
<p>subtly to the aid of the race and the state. The purification ritual,
however external in form, served as a stimulating symbol of moral
hygiene. The gods gave a general, if vague and inconstant, support to
virtue; they frowned upon wickedness, revenged themselves upon pride,
protected the stranger and the suppliant, and lent their terror to the
sanctity of oaths. Dike, we are told, punished every wrong, and the
awful Eumenides pur- sued the murderer, like Orestes, to madness or
death. The central acts and institutions of human life — birth,
marriage, the family, the clan, the state- received a sacramental
dignity from religion, and were rescued from the chaos of hasty desire.
Through the worship or honoring of the dead, the generations were bound
together in a stabilizing continuity of obligations, so that the family
was not merely a couple and their children, or even a patriarchal
assemblage of parents, children, and grandchildren, but a holy union and
sequence of blood and fire stretching far into the past and the future,
and holding the dead, the living, and the unborn in a sacred unity
stronger than any state. Religion not only made the procreation of
children a solemn duty to the dead, but encouraged it through the fear
of the child- less man that no posterity would inter him or tend his
grave. So long as this rehgion kept its influence, the Greek people
reproduced themselves vigorously, and as plentifully among the best as
among the worst; and in this way, with the help of a merciless natural
selection, the strength and quahty of the race were maintained. Religion
and patriotism were bound together in a thousand impressive rites; the
god or goddess most revered in public ceremony represented the
apotheosis of the city; every law, every meeting of the assembly or the
courts, every major enterprise of the army or the government, every
school and university, every economic or politi- cal association, was
surrounded with religious ceremony and invocation. In all these ways
Greek religion was used as a defense by the co mmuni ty and the race
against the natural egoism of the individual man.</p>
<p>Art, literature, and philosophy first strengthened this influence,
and then weakened it. Pindar, Aeschylus, and Sophocles poured their own

<p>fervor or insight into the Olympian creed, and Pheidias ennobled the
gods with beauty and majesty; Pj^hagoras and Plato associated philosophy
with religion, and supported the doctrine of immortality as a stimulus
to morals. But Protagoras doubted, Socrates ignored, Democritus denied,
Euripides ridiculed the gods; and in the end Greek philosophy, hardly
willing it, destroyed the religion that had molded the moral life of
Greece.</p>
