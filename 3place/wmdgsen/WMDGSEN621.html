<h4 id="chapter-xxvi-italy-and-its-conquerors">CHAPTER XXVI Italy and
Its Conquerors</h4>
<p>1789 — 1813</p>
<p>I. THE MAP IN 1789</p>
<p>I N this period Italy was not a nation but a battleground. Split into
jeal- ously separate regions and dialects, the country was too
fragmented to stand united against foreign attack, and (north of Naples)
too blessed with sun and a fruitful, well-watered soil — beneficent
streams curling down from Alps or Apennines — to shoulder arms
repeatedly for the difference between</p>
<p>Most of Italy had fallen under the rule or influence of the Austrian
Haps- burg dynasty by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which assigned
Milan, Mantua, Naples, Sardinia, and their dependencies to the Emperor
Charles VI. In the northwest corner of the peninsula Savoy and Piedmont
were ruled by the kings of Sardinia. In 1734 the “Kingdom of the Two
Sicilies,” with its foci at Naples and Palermo, was transferred from the
Hapsburgs to the Bourbons by the able warrior and ruler who became
Charles III of Spain. Before passing to Spain he bequeathed the
Neapolitan realm to his son Ferdinand IV, who married the Archduchess
Maria Carolina; and her domi- nation of her husband brought the entire
kingdom of Naples under Aus- trian influence. When the Empress Maria
Theresa died (1780) her sons governed Lombardy, Tuscany, and Modena; her
daughters were married respectively to the rulers of Naples and Parma;
and Savoy, Piedmont, and Sardinia had fallen under an Austrian
protectorate. The only independent regions in Italy were then Venice,
Lucca, San Marino, and Genoa. In this division of Italy between the
Austrian Hapsburgs in the north and the Span- ish Bourbons in the south
the Papal States remained papal only because the rival dynasties that
embraced them with possessive ardor were restrained by their mutual
jealousy and that Catholic piety which alone made Italy one.</p>
<p>Austrian rule in northern Italy was excellent in terms of the time.
In</p>
<p>Lombardy the feudal and ecclesiastical proprietors were taxed, and
their privileges had been considerably reduced; a hundred monasteries
were closed, and their revenues were devoted to education or charity;
under the scholarly prodding of Cesare Beccaria’s Dei delitti e delle
pene (17 64) judi- cial procedure was reformed, torture was abolished,
and the criminal law was made more humane. In Tuscany, between 1765 and
1790, Grand Duke Leopold gave the former territory of the Medici
“perhaps the best govem -</p>
<p>54 1</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>5 4 2</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>ment in Europe.” 1 Florence, his capital, remained a citadel of
civilization through all the fluctuations of power and ideas.</p>
<p>Venice, rich, corrupt, and beautiful, was now (1789) visibly nearing
her end as a sovereign state. Her eastern empire had long since been
lost to the Turks, but her rule was still acknowledged between the Alps
and Padua, and between Trieste and Brescia. Formally a republic,
actually a closed aristocracy, its government had become listless,
oppressive and incompetent. It had the best spies in Christendom, but no
army. It had become the play- ground of Europe, pledged to pleasure, and
trusting to its courtesans to keep her enemies amiable. Caught between
Austria on the north and Aus- trian Lombardy on the west, it was clearly
fated to be absorbed by Austria whenever France ceased to protect
her.</p>
<p>South of Tuscany and the Po the Papal States began their sinuous
contour with the Romagna and its “Legations”— Ferrara, Bologna, and
Ravenna, each administered by a papal legate; then southward with the
“Marches,” or borderlands near the Adriatic — Rimini, Ancona, and
Urbino; then across the Apennines through Umbria’s Perugia and Spoleto,
and through Latium’s Orvieto and Viterbo to Rome. All this historic
region was under the popes, according to the “donations” made to the
Church by Pepin, king of the Franks, in 754, and by Charlemagne in 774.
After a decisive victory in the Council of Trent (1545-63), the popes
had enlarged their authority over the bishops, as the contemporary kings
were doing over the feudal lords; power is centripetal.</p>
<p>But soon thereafter the Papacy entered into a slow decay as the
advances of science and the inroads of philosophy left the Church with a
dangerously reduced support in the influential classes of Western
Europe; ana it was meeting open opposition not only from Protestant
rulers but as well from Catholic sovereigns like Joseph II of Austria
and Ferdinand IV of Naples. Even in the states of the Church a growing
minority of secret skeptics weakened the hold of the clergy upon the
people. The Curia or papal court (wrote Joseph II in 1768) “has become
almost an object of scorn. Internal ly its people exist in the deepest
misery, wholly depressed, while its internal finances are in complete
disorder and discredit.” Joseph, an unbeliever, may have been
prejudiced, but the Venetian ambassador reported in 1783 that “the
internal affairs o f the pontifical state are in the greatest disarray;
it is in a progressive decline, and the government daily loses force and
au- thority.” 2 Despite their poverty, and the malarial infection of the
summer air, the people of Rome made life tolerable by taking full
advantage of the churchly indulgence given to their perennial amours and
Carnival games; and the clergy itself relaxed under the Italian sun.</p>
<p>Both of the popes in this critical period were pious and honorable
men. Pius VI (r. 1775-99), despite his arduous trip to Vienna, failed to
win Joseph II of Austria to obedience; and all his culture and
gentleness did not save him from losing Avignon to France and dying a
prisoner of the Direc- tory. Pius VII (r. 1800-23) did his best to
restore Catholicism in France,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>543</p>
<p>suffered a long imprisonment under Napoleon, and lived to triumph
humbly over the fallen Emperor (1814).</p>
<p>South of the Papal States the Spanish Bourbons grew rich with the
pros- perity of Gaeta, Capua, Caserta, Naples, Capri, and Sorrento.. But
there Italian prosperity ceased. Gties like Pescara, Aquila, Foggia,
Bari, Brindisi, Taranto, and Crotone remembered Milo, Caesar, Frederick
II (Holy Roman emperor , “ stupor mundi”), even Pythagoras; but they
were burned by an immoderate sun, despoiled with taxes, and comforted
only by their creed. Then the taxgatherer crossed from Reggio Calabria
to Messina in Sicily (“from Scylla to Charybdis”); and there too t he
cities dignified their pov- erty under memories of Phoenicians, Greeks,
Carthaginians, Romans, Van- dals, Moslems, Normans, Spaniards, until the
taxgatherers stopped at Palermo and attended to the needs and luxuries
of kings and queens, merchant princes, brigands, and saints. Such was
the colorful realm which the eight- year-old Ferdinand IV inherited in
1759. He grew into a handsome athlete who preferred pleasure and sports
to the burdens of power, and mostly left the government to his wife
Maria Carolina.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of her Prime Minister and paramour, Sir John
Acton, Maria oriented Neapolitan policy from pro-Spain to pro-Austria,
and, in 1791, to pro-England. Meanwhile feudal barons exacted every due
from an exhausted peasantry; corruption reigned in the court, the
bureaucracy, and the judiciary; taxes were high, and fell chiefly upon
the lower classes; the city populace was barbarized by poverty,
habituated to disorder and crime, and held in check by a numerous police
and by an obscurantist clergy skilled in miracles. (In a chapel of the
cathedral the relics of Saint Januarius bled annually.) As usual, the
Church was lenient with sins of the flesh; after all, these were the
only luxury allowed to the poor; and in Carnival days the Sixth
Commandment was looked upon as an unwarranted imposition upon human
nature.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Queen was jealous of Catherine II of Russia, who had
so many philosophers at her call or knee. So she patronized artists,
scholars, and professors of wisdom; and though she probably did not know
it, Naples had “more educated men and women of modern ideas than any
other city in Italy.” 3 Many of these men followed with silent hope the
news that came from Paris that the people had stormed and taken the
Bastille.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ITALY AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>An impressive scattering of liberals had prepared the educated
classes of Italy for some basic transformation in France. Beccaria and
Parini in Milan, Tanucci, Genovesi, and Filangieri in Naples, Caraccioli
in Sicily, had al- ready labored, in prose and poetry, in legislation
and philosophy, for some of the measures that were now being passed by a
French National Assembly apparently pledged to reason and moderation. In
Tuscany the Grand Duke</p>
<p>544 the age of NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>Leopold himself hailed the Revolution as promising precious reforms
in every country in Europe. 4</p>
<p>When Napoleon, as son and general of the Revolution, rushed into
Italy (1796), like some wild west wind, and drove the Sardinian and
Austrian armies out of Piedmont and Lombardy, nearly all the population
welcomed him as an Italian leading French troops to the liberation of
Italy. For a while, despite local insurrections at Pavia, Genoa, and
Verona, he was able to dis- pose of Italian states and principalities as
if they had fallen into his hands as unconditional gifts. So in July and
August, 1797, he bundled Milan, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Bologna, and a
slice of Switzerland into a medley called the Cisalpine Republic, and
gave it a constitution like that of Revo- lutionary France.</p>
<p>The liberalism of his early rule in north Italy quieted for a time
the local dreams of liberty. The native leaders, softened with sinecures
and dignities, recognized that on a continent divided among wolves, one
or another of the wolves must be accepted as protector; and better one
that spoke excellent Italian and eased taxation and art raids with
enlightened laws. But the ad- vancing legislation of the Revolution
against the Catholic Church in France checked this Italian sympathy;
their religion proved more precious to the Italian populace than a
political liberty persecuting priests and smelling of September
Massacres.</p>
<p>In Rome, January 13, 1792, a diplomatic agent of France was attacked
by a mob, and so severely handled that he died the next day. This
created a new crisis for Pope Pius VI, who had already suffered from the
Edict of Toleration (1781) of Joseph II in Austria. Now he found himself
faced by the Revolution’s expropriation of French Church property, and
the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (July 12, 1790). Brought up to
complete ortho- doxy and a trustful respect for tradition, Pius
denounced the Revolution, and supported the challenged kings in their
efforts to suppress it. At the Peace of Tolentino (February 19, 1797) he
was compelled, by the victories and threats of Napoleon, to cede to
France the papal enclaves of Avignon and Venaissin, and to the new
Gsalpine Republic the city-states of Ferrara, Bologna, and Ravenna.</p>
<p>In December, 1797, a Roman mob killed the French General Leonard
Duphot. General Louis Berthier, who had succeeded Napoleon (then in
Egypt) in command of the Army of Italy, seized the opportunity to invade
Rome and set up a Roman Republic under French rule. Pius VI protested,
was arrested, resisted, and was transported from place to place until he
died at Valence, as a prisoner of the Directory, on August 29, 1799.
Observers innocent of history wondered whether the Papacy had come to an
end. 5</p>
<p>The situation offered Ferdinand IV of Naples a triple opportunity: to
test the new army that had been organized for him by Sir John Acton, to
prove himself a loyal son of the Church, and to take a slice of papal
territory as an honorarium. Admiral Nelson, who was then tarrying in
Naples in thrall to Emma Hamilton, agreed to help by landing a naval
force at Leghorn. The King gave command of his army to the Austrian
General Karl Mack, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI )</p>
<p>ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>rode with it to the easy conquest of Rome (November 29, 1798). The
French regiments left there decided that they were no match for the
whole Neapolitan Army, and readily evacuated the city.</p>
<p>While the scattered cardinals were choosing a new pope in Venice,
Ferdi- nand’s troops sampled the art and belles of Rome. Meanwhile a
brilliant general, Jean-£tienne Championnet, came down from the north
with a fresh French army, led it to a victory over Mack’s disordered
troops at Civita Castellana (December 15, 1798), pursued them all the
way to Naples, took that city to the joy of its intelligentsia, and set
up there the Parthenopean Republic (January 23, 1799). Ferdinand and his
Queen, Sir William Hamil- ton and his Bovary, fled to Palermo on
Nelson’s flagship Vanguard.</p>
<p>The new republic lasted less than five months. Championnet and many
of his men were summoned north to repel the Austrians; he died in that
cam- paign (1800). Cardinal Fabrizzio Ruffo, aided by the English
Captain Ed- ward Foote, organized a new army for Ferdinand, and
recaptured Naples with the help of the populace, which looked upon the
French garrison as verily damned atheists. The French, with the
assistance of a Neapolitan ad- miral, Francesco Caracciolo, took refuge
in two of the harbor’s forts. Cardi - nal Ruffo and Captain Foote
offered them unhindered departure for France if they would surrender.
They agreed, but before the pact could be carried out Nelson and his
fleet, bearing the royal party, arrived from Palermo; Nel- son took
command, and, over the protests of the Cardinal, turned his guns upon
the forts. 6 The French surrendered unconditionally. Caracciolo was
caught while trying to sail away; he was hastily tried before a military
court on Nelson’s ship, and was hanged from the yardarm of his flagship,
La Mi - nerva (June 29, 1799). King and Queen, restored to power,
imprisoned hun- dreds of liberals, and put their leaders to death.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ITALY UNDER NAPOLEON: l8oO-I2</li>
</ol>
<p>For nine months after his return from Egypt Napoleon devoted himself
to reconciling the French nation to his definition of political liberty
as periodical plebiscites foreseeably approving enlightened despotism.
France was tiring of democratic liberty just when Italian liberals,
fretting under restored Austrian rule, were longing for it. When would
that brilliant Italian-become-Frenchman come again to Italy, boot out
those Austrians, and give Italy an Italian government?</p>
<p>The crafty Consul took his time, for careful preparation was the
first principle of his strategy. When at last he came it was by a dash
more bril- liant even than the onrush of 1796: a climb up and slide down
the Alps, dividing the Austrians in two, taking their main army in the
rear, hemming it in, holding it and its old commander prisoners until
the Austrian wolf sur- rendered to the Gallic fox all of its Italian
possessions west of Venezia (1801). Napoleon juggled his winnings into
something much like the con- figuration that he had made in 1797. The
Gsalpine Republic, centering</p>
<p>54 6 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>around Milan, and the Ligurian Republic at Genoa were given relative
inde- pendence, with Italian governors under a French protectorate. The
Papal States were as yet left undisturbed. Concordats were being
prepared with the Church, and Napoleon had ceased to be a Mohammedan. By
a treaty of March 1 8, 1801, Ferdinand IV of Naples agreed to close
Neapolitan ports to British shipping; Nelson could not help, for he was
busy attacking Copen- hagen (April 2, 1801). Italians sensed a fine
Italian hand behind the consum- mations, and rejoiced.</p>
<p>Then the hand closed in the grasp of power. In January, 1802, a
delega- tion of 454 delegates from the Cisalpine Republic met in Lyons,
adopted a new constitution drawn up by Napoleon, and accepted
Talleyrand’s inspired proposal to elect Napoleon president of the new
Republica Italiana. After he made himself emperor of the French (1804),
the title President of Italy seemed incongruously modest; so, on May 26,
1805, Napoleon received in Milan the old and revered Iron Crown of the
Lombard kings, and became sovereign of (north) Italy. He introduced the
Code Napoleon, equalized educational opportunity by milking the richer
provinces to help the poorer, and promised to keep “my people of Italy…
the least heavily taxe d of all the nations of Europe.” Departing, he
left with them, as his viceroy and a pledge of solicitude, his beloved
stepson Eugene de Beauharnais.</p>
<p>For the next eight years the new kingdom (mainly Lombardy) enjoyed a
general prosperity, and a vigorous political life, which would long be
blessed in Italian memory. The government made no pretense to democ-
racy; Napoleon had no faith in the ability of the populace, there or
else- where, to wisely choose its leaders and its policy. Instead he
advised Eugene to gather about him the most experienced and competent
administrators. They served him with enthusiasm and skill. They
organized a competent bureaucracy; they set on foot extensive public
works — roads, canals, parks, housing, schools; they reformed
sanitation, prisons, and the penal code; they spread literacy and
fostered music and art. Taxes rose from 82 million francs in 1805 to 144
million in 1812, but part of this reflected inflation of the cur- rency
to finance war, and part of it was a redistribution of concentrated
wealth for the public good.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Emperor continued to Napoleonize Italy. In September,
1802, he annexed Piedmont to France. In June, 1805, he charmed the gov-
ernment of Genoa into asking for the incorporation of its Ligurian
Republic into the French Empire. In September, 1805, he absorbed the
duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla. In December, 1805, after
almost annihilating the Austrian Army at Austerlitz, he persuaded the
Emperor Francis II to surrender Venezia to Eugene’s new kingdom. Venice
was so grateful for this partial atonement of Napoleon’s disgraceful
bartering of her in 1797 that when he visited the city in 1807 it
exhausted itself in festivities. 7 In May, 1808, he took over the grand
duchy of Tuscany, where Austrian adminis- tration had been at its best.
His sister Elisa had ruled Lucca so well that Napoleon transferred her
to Tuscany, where, under her wise and concilia-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>ory government, Florence became a haven of letters and arts
reminiscent of its Medicean days.</p>
<p>On March 30, 1806, Napoleon proclaimed his brother Joseph king of
Naples, and sent him, with French troops, to evict the unmanageable
Ferdi- nand IV and hiS demanding Queen. The Emperor seems to have
reserved the most difficult assignments for the genial Joseph, and to
have judged his performance with small consideration of the difficulties
involved. Joseph was a man of culture, who liked the company of educated
men, and of women whose education had not ruined their charm. 8 With
such a modus vivendi, Bonaparte felt, a man could never successfully
govern a kingdom. Why appoint him, then? Because the conqueror had more
kingdoms than brothers, and felt that he could trust no one but his
close relatives.</p>
<p>Joseph was readily accepted as king of Naples by leaders of the
middle class, restless under feudalism; but the populace rejected him as
a usurper and an infidel, and Joseph had to steel himself to severe
measures to subdue their resistance. The Queen had taken to Sicily all
funds in the state bank; a British fleet blockaded the port and stifled
maritime trade; and the French troops, victorious but ill-paid, were
dangerously insubordinate. Joseph ap- pealed to his brother for some
negotiable currency; Napoleon bade him make Naples pay for its
liberation. Joseph negotiated a loan from Dutch bankers, and laid a tax
upon all incomes, noble or plebeian, clerical or lay. He brought in from
Paris Comte Pierre- Louis Roederer, one of Napoleon’s favorite
economists, to take charge of the fisc; and soon the state’s finances
were in good order. Other experienced administrators established a free
school in every commune of the kingdom, and a college in every province.
Feudalism was abolished; the lands of the Church were nationalized and
sold to the peasantry and to a growing middle class. Laws were
harmonized under a variant of the Napoleonic Code. The judiciary was
cleansed, pro- cedure was expedited, prisons and penal code were
reformed. 9</p>
<p>Joseph was nearing success and public approval when he was suddenly
summoned to a throne and task still more difficult and dangerous — to be
king of Spain (June 10, 1808). In his place Napoleon, running out of
brothers, set up, as Icing of Naples, Joachim Murat, who was his
brother-in-law by marriage with Caroline Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Murat is remembered chiefly for his showy costumes and his fearless
initi- ative in battle; let us honor him for his reconstruction of the
Neapolitan government. He was a man with all the peasant virtues except
patience, fitter for herculean tasks than for cunning diplomacy or
farsighted statesmanship; a loving husband between squalls, and faithful
to his imperious brother-in- law till he thought him mad. We can
understand his complaint that the Continental Blockade demanded by
Napoleon was ruining Naples’ economic life. Nevertheless, perhaps
because of his impatience, he and his aides accom- plished much in his
four-year reign. They completed the reform of taxation, established a
national bank, paid off the national debt (mostly through the</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>sale of ecclesiastical property), abolished internal traffic tolls,
and financed substantial public works. Altogether, the administrations
of Joseph and Murat, lasting less than eight years, transformed the
political, economic, and social life of Naples so fundamentally that
when Ferdinand IV was re- stored to his throne in 1815 he accepted
nearly all the reforms that the French had made.</p>
<p>Dearer than these accomplishments to Joachim’s heart was the army of
sixty thousand men which he had organized and trained, and with which he
hoped to unite Italy and be its first king. From that dream, and from
the sun of Italy, he was peremptorily summoned, in 1812, to join his
brother-in-law in the conquest of Russia.</p>

<li>EMPEROR AND POPE</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon felt that he had taken substantial steps in transforming
Italy from a geographical expression into a nation by organizing the
Cisalpine Republic in the north and the kingdom of Naples in the south.
But the Aus- trians, during his absence in Egypt, had put an end to the
Roman Republic established by the French only a year before; the Papacy
had regained its historic capital, and most of its Papal States; and on
March 13, 1800, a con- clave of cardinals had elected a new pontiff,
Pius VII, to whom nearly all Catholics looked for a firm def ense of the
“temporal power”— the territorial possessions — of the popes.</p>
<p>Napoleon found Pius reasonable enough in negotiating concordats in
Paris and Rome, and in blessing his assumption of imperial powers. But
those Papal States (though not, as once claimed, deeded to the Church by
the supposed “Donation of Constantine”*) had been given to Pope
Stephen</p>

<p>CHAP. XXVl) ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>Your Majesty the evacuation of Ancona; and if we are met with a
refusal, we fail to see how we can reconcile it with the maintenance of
friendly re- lations with Your Majesty’s minister.” 12 Hotly resenting
the timing of this ultimatum, which he received at Vienna on the eve of
Austerlitz, Napoleon answered the Pope w ith a counterchallenge: “Your
Holiness is the sovereign of Rome, but I am its emperor.” 13 Having
spoken like Charlemagne, he ad - vanced like Caesar, and overwhelmed the
Austrians and the Russians at Aus- terlitz.</p>
<p>A year later (November 12, 1806), having destroyed the Prussian Army
at Jena, Napoleon sent from Berlin to the Pope a demand that the English
be expelled from Rome, and that the Papal States join the “Italian
Confedera - tion”; for, he said, he could not tolerate, “between his
Kingdom of Italy and his Kingdom of Naples,” the existence of “ports and
fortresses which, in the event of war, might be occupied by the English,
and compromise the safety of his states and his peoples.” 14 Pius was
given till Fe bruary, 1807, to obey; he refused, and allowed the British
minister to remain in Rome. On his triumphant return from Tilsit
Napoleon again demanded the expulsion of the English agents from Rome;
Pius again refused. On August 30 Napoleon threatened to seize the Papal
Marches. Frightened, Pius agreed to close his ports to the British.
Napoleon now demanded that the Pope make common cause with him against
the enemies of France. Pius refused. On January 10,</p>
<p>1808, Napoleon ordered General Miollis (then heading a French
division in Florence) to march upon Rome.</p>
<p>From that day events moved forward in one more historic conflict be-
tween Church and state. On February 2 Miollis and his troops took
Civita- vecchia; the next day they entered Rome, and surrounded the
Quirinal — the hill that held the papal palace and the offices of the
Curia. From that time till March, 1814, Pius VII was a prisoner of
France. On April 2, 1808, Napoleon ordered the annexation of the Papal
Marches to the kingdom of Italy. Now there was an open corridor between
the kingdom of Naples and the king- dom of Italy — between Joseph and
Eugene.</p>
<p>A year intervened, in which Napoleon was busy with Spain. On May 1
7,</p>
<p>1809, from Vienna again conquered, Napoleon proclaimed the absorption
of the Papal States into the French Empire, and the end of the temporal
power of the popes. On June 10 the Pope excommunicated Napoleon. On July
6 General Radet led some French troops into the Pope’s audience chamber
and gave him a choice of abdication or exile. Pius took only his
breviary and a crucifix, and followed his captors to a waiting carriage,
which bore him along the Italian coast past Genoa to Savona. There he
was kept in polite imprisonment until Napoleon — after publishing an
alleged plot to abduct the Pontiff to England — had him transferred to
Fontainebleau (June, 1812). On February 13, 1813, Pius signed a new
agreement with Napoleon; on March 24 he revoked his signature. In his
palatial jail he lived simply, even to mending his own shirt. 15 He
remained there through all the events of 1812 and 1813, until, on
January 21, 1814, Napoleon, himself facing imprisonment, had him
returned to Savona. In April, the Allies,</p>
<p>55 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>having taken Paris and Napoleon, sent word to the Pope that he was
free. On May 24 Pius VII, worn out with physical and mental suffering,
re- entered Rome. Nearly all the population welcomed him with fervor and
acclaim; young Romans competed for the privilege of replacing the horses
and drawing his carriage to the Quirinal. 16</p>
<p>In their brief control of the Papal States Napoleon’s French admi
nistra- tors, helped by native liberals, transformed the economic and
political scene with perhaps painful vigor and speed. Feudalism and the
Inquisition were ended. Over five hundred religious houses were closed,
giving an uncom- fortable freedom to 5,852 monks and nuns. Corrupt
officials were dismissed; public accountancy was introduced. Roads were
repaired and policed; brigandage was almost stopped. Streets were
cleaned and lighted; a quarter of the Pontine Marshes was drained and
put under cultivation. Religious liberty was proclaimed; the Jews moved
freely from their ghetto; Masonic lodges flourished. Hospitals
multiplied; prisons were improved; schools were built and manned; a new
university was opened in Perugia. The excavation of classic remains was
continued, and Canova was put in charge of a museum that housed the
findings. But taxes were collected with unheard-of insis- tence, and men
were conscripted into the national Army. The merchants complained of the
restrictions laid upon trade with England. The majority of the
population frowned upon the sudden transformation of their tradi- tional
institutions, and the scandalous treatment of a Pope whom even the
atheists had begun to love. “The populace looked back with regret to the
soft and indolent rule of the Pope.” 17</p>
<p>All in all, Napoleon’s imprisonment of Pius VII was an astonishing
blun - der for so astute a ruler. The concordats and the coronation had
brought to the Consul and the Emperor a helpful reconciliation with
Catholics through- out Europe, and even a formal acceptance of his rule
by nearly all the kings of Europe; but his later treatment of the Pope
alienated nearly all Catholics and many Protestants. The Papacy was
strengthened by Napoleon’s attempt to make it his political instrument;
the French Catholic Church, which till his time had been “Gallican”—
i.e., antipapal — now gave its reverence and loyalty to the Papacy. The
Jesuits, who had been expelled by a politically intimidated Pope, were
restored throughout Christendom by the gentle but resolute Pius VII in
1814. The temporal power of the Papacy was renewed in that year, and its
spiritual power was increased by the quiet resistance of the imprisoned
Pope. Napoleon himself, between abdications, admitted his misjudgment of
Pius VII. “I always believed the Pope to be a man of very weak
character…. I treated him harshly. I was wrong. I was blind.” 18 Pius,
on the other hand, had never underestimated Napoleon, had in many ways
admired him, and showed a certain tenderness for him when his former
jailer became a prisoner in turn. When Napoleon’s mother complained to
the Pope that the English were mistreating her son on St. Helena, Pius
begged Cardinal Consalvi to intercede for his fallen foe. 19 The Pope
outlived the Emperor by two years. He died in 1823, murmuring, in
delirium, “Savona, Fontainebleau.” 20</p>

<p>ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>551</p>
<p>V. BEHIND THE BATTLES</p>
<p>Battles are the technical fireworks of the historic drama; behind
them are the loves and hates of men and women, the toil and gambles of
economic life, the defeats and triumphs of science, literature, and art,
the desperate longings of religious faith.</p>
<p>The Italian may have been a hurried lover, but he attended lustily to
the continuance of the species, and so littered the golden peninsula
with his like that one function of the battles was to reduce the
pullulating crowd. The Church discouraged childlessness more than
adultery, for so she could dis- arm dissent with multiplication. She
smiled on Eros, and laid no puritan pall upon Carnival ecstasies. Girls
were almost always virginal, for marriage came early, and premarital
surveillance was severe; but after marriage — since this was usually a
union of properties — a woman might take a cavaliere ser- vente, or even
a lover, and still be respectable; if she employed two or three lovers
she was accounted “a little wild.” This, however, is the testimo ny of
Byron, 21 who liked to believe every woman accessible. Perhaps he meant
to speak only of Venice, where Venus seemed especially at home, but
Stendhal gave a similar picture of Milan in his Chartreuse de Par
me.</p>
<p>Despite such easy morals, the life of the Milanese in 1 805 seemed
dull to Mme. de Remusat, who mourned “the absolute nonexistence of
family life — the husbands strangers to their wives, leaving them to the
care of a cavaliere servente”; 22 and Mme. de Stael, who shone in
bisexual discourse, was dis - pleased with what she considered the
superficiality of conversation domi- nated by males; “the Italians,” she
thought, “shrink from the fatigue of thinking.” 23 The Italians cou ld
have reminded her that the Church frowned upon audible thinking; and the
great majority of them agreed with the Pope that a religion with a
settled creed and transalpine revenues was a beneficent institution in
Italy. Even so, there was much quiet free thought among the educated
minority, 24 and considerable political heresy. Alfieri could rhap-
sodize over the French Revolution until it confiscated his property, and
hundreds of Italians applauded the news of the fallen Bastille. Italy
had bisexua l societies of polite learning like the Accademia dell’
Arcadia; and that once famous congregation of learned men and women, the
Accademia della Crusca, was reconstituted in 1812. In 1800 a woman,
Clotilda Tambroni, was teaching Greek in the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>There and in other Italian universities science and medicine were
flourish- ing. In 1791, at the University of Bologna, Luigi Galvani
(1737-98) showed that if the muscle of a frog’s leg is connected with a
piece of iron, and its nerve is connected with a piece of copper, an
electric current will be gen- erated and will cause the muscle to
contract. In 1795, at the University of Pavia, Alessandro Volta (1745-
1827) invented the “Voltaic pile,” or stor - age battery, which so
astonished Europe that he was called to Paris in 1801 to demonstrate it
at the Institute; and on November 7, before an audience</p>
<p>552 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>hat included Napoleon, he read a paper “On the Identity of the
Electric Fluid with the Galvanic Fluid.” In 1807 Luigi Rolando published
his epochal researches in the anatomy of the brain. “Thoughtless” Italy
was teaching Europe a revolution greater than the French.</p>
<p>The Italian theater languished because Italians found it so natural
to trans- form speech into song, and drama into opera. The populace
flocked to sim- ple plays in the style of the commedia dell ’ arte; the
maturer spirits went to such dramas as those in which Vittorio Alfieri
(1749-1803) had proclaimed his hatred of tyranny and his longing for the
liberation of Italy from foreign rule. Nearly all his plays antedated
the French Revolution; 25 but his pas- sionate treatise Della tirannide,
written in 1777, published in Baden in 1787, and at last in Italy in 1
800, became one of the classics of Italian philosophy and prose.
Finally, in Misogallo (1799), nearing the end of his troubled life, he
appealed to the Italian people to rise and throw off all alien rule and
be- come a united nation. Here the Risorgimento of Mazzini and Garibaldi
found its first clear voice.</p>
<p>The extroverted ardor, the melodious language, and the musical bent
of the Italians lent themselves to poetry. This brief age — even after
surrender- ing Alfieri to the past and Leopardi to the future — had a
hundred poets climbing Parnassus. Happiest of them was Vincenzo Monti
(1754-1828), who had a good word to say for every promising subject. La
Bassevilliana (1793) defended religion against the French Revolution,
and won him ac- ceptance at the papal court; in II bar do della Selva
Nera (1806) he gloried in Napoleon’s liberation of Italy, and he was
appointed by the conqueror to a professorship in the University of
Pavia; after the fall of Napoleon he discovered and proclaimed the
faults of the French and the virtues of the Austrians. Through all these
leaps he continued to praise La bellezza delV universo. He surpassed
these flights in his translation of the Iliad (1810); he knew no Greek,
but merely versified a prose version, so that Foscolo called him gran
traduttor dei traduttore d’Omero.</p>
<p>Ugo Foscolo (1778-1827) was a greater poet and sadder man. Being a
poet, he was sensuous passion rather than ordered thought; he indulged
his desires, passed from one romance to another, from one country or
gospel to another, and ended with a longing for old dreams. But through
all his phases he was a patient craftsman, seeking perfect form for his
verses, even when discarding, as specious ornaments, not only rhyme but
rhythm, and seeking perfection in a language-music all his own.</p>
<p>He was born between two worlds — on the Ionian island of Zante
between Greece and Italy, from an Italian seed in a Greek womb. After
fifteen years in Zante he moved to Venice, sampled its frail beauties,
fell in love with its decadent charm, and learned to hate the neighborly
grasp of Austria. He re- joiced when Napoleon came like a torrent from
Nice to Mantua; he hailed the hero of Arcole as Buonaparte liber atore;
but when the unprincipled savior surrendered Venice to Austria he turned
upon him in a romantic novel, Le ultime letter e di Iacopo Ortis ( 1798)
— the last letters of a Venetian Werther</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS 553</p>
<p>who recounts, in letters to a friend, the double loss of his
inamorata to a rival, and of his beloved Venice to a Teutonic ogre.</p>
<p>When the Austrians set out to reconquer north Italy, Foscolo joined
the French Army, fought bravely at Bologna, Florence, Milan, and served
as a captain in the forces that Napoleon prepared for the invasion of
England. When that dream faded, Foscolo abandoned the bayonet for the
pen, re- turned to Italy, and published there his finest work, 1
sepolcri (1807). In these classically polished, romantically emotional
three hundred pages he defended tomb inscriptions as the inspiring
remembrance of great men; he honored the Church of Santa Croce in
Florence for carefully preserving the remains of Machiavelli,
Michelangelo, and Galileo; he asked how a people that had through many
centuries produced so many heroes of thought and action, so many
masterpieces of philosophy, poetry, and art, could rest con- tent with
alien masters; and he exalted the legacy of great men as their real
immortality, and as the soul and spiritual life of the nation and the
race.</p>
<p>When, in 1814-15, the Austrians again became masters of northern
Italy, Foscolo exiled himself to Switzerland, and thence to England. He
supported himself by giving lessons and writing articles, and died in
great poverty in</p>
<ol start="1827" type="1">
<li>In 1871 his remains were brought from England to Florence, and were
buried in Santa Croce, in an Italy at last free.</li>
</ol>
<p>“In Italy,” said Byron (who loved it nonetheless), “a man must be
a</p>
<p>cicisb eo [a “serving cavalier”], or a singer in duets, or
connoisseur of op - eras, or nothing.” 26 Italian opera, generated
especially in Venice and Naples, still dominated the sounding boards of
Europe, after a brief challenge by Gluck and Mozart; soon (1815 )
Rossini’s engaging melodies and tempestu - ous arias would steal the
stage, even in Vienna. Piccini, after his bout with Gluck in Paris,
returned to Naples, and was placed in house arrest for sym- pathizing
with the French Revolution; after Napoleon’s conquest of Italy he was
again invited to France (1798), but died there two years later. Pai-
siello, as composer and conductor, triumphed in St. Petersburg, in
Vienna, in Paris, and in Naples under Ferdinand IV, then under Joseph,
then under Murat. Domenico Gmarosa succeeded Antonio Salieri as
Kapellmeister in Vienna, and produced there the most famous of his
operas, II matrimonio segreto (1792). In 1793 he was called back to
Naples as viaestro di capella by Ferdinand; when the French took Naples
he received them gladly; when Ferdinand was restored he sentenced the
composer to death, but was induced to commute this to exile. Cimarosa
set out for St. Petersburg, but died at Venice on the way (1801).
Meanwhile Muzio Clementi was composing and performing piano music in
various capitals, and was preparing the once fa- mous Gradus ad
Parnassum (1817) for the instruction of young pianists everywhere.</p>
<p>Niccolo Paganini (1782-1840) began at Geneva in 1797 his long career
as a concert violinist. Loving his violin more passionately and
faithfully than he loved any of the many women who throbbed to his
music, he developed the</p>
<p>55 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>possibilities of the instrument to unprecedented complexities of
composition and performance. He composed twenty-four capricci, which
astonished with the whimsicality of their developments. Elisa Bonaparte
Bacciocchi ap-</p>
<p>E ointed him music director at Piombino (1805), but that could not
long eep him from the tours where his concerts were sure to bring him
large audiences and pleasant wealth. In 1833 he settled in Paris. He
gave twenty thousand francs to Berlioz, who was struggling with poverty,
and encour- aged him to compose Harold in Italy. Paganini’s strenuous
working and playing brought him to exhaustion. He decided to leave the
excitement of a capital that was frantic with genius and bubbling with
revolution. He died at Nice in 1 840, leaving — besides his capricci —
eight concertos and numerous sonatas to challenge the violin virtuosi of
the advancing century. The art of the violin is only now recovering from
his antic pranks.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ANTONIO CANOVA: 1757-1822</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy in the age of Napoleon was too absorbed in war and politics,
too poor in public spirit or private philanthropy, to generate such art,
and par- ticularly such architecture, as had exalted Italy when all
Europe was sending “Peter’s pence” to the popes, and Florence, Venice,
and Milan, as well as Rome and Naples, were rich and self-ruled. Some
outstanding struc- tures were raised: Luigi Cagnola’s Arco della Pace in
Milan ( 1 806 -3 3 ) » An- tonio Selva’s Teatro la Fenice in Venice
(1792); Cosimo Morelli’s Palazzo Braschi at Rome (1795), with its
stately staircase; and Antonio Niccolini’s imposing fagade (1810-12) of
the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. There was no memorable painting, but
Italy’s sculptors were inspired by the excava - tions at Herculaneum to
discard the eccentricities of baroque and the exuber- ance of rococo,
and to seek the grace and calm and simple line of classic statuary. One
of these sculptors left us work that still stops the eye, tempts the
touch, and lives in the memory.</p>
<p>Antonio Canova was born in Possagno, at the foot of the Venetian
Alps. Both his father and his grandfather were sculptors, specializing
in altars and religious monuments. When the father died (1760) the
grandfather took Antonio into his home, and later into his studio. The
boy’s willingness to work and eagerness to learn caught the attention of
Giovanni Falier, a patrician of Arsolo. Falier provided funds for
Antonio’s study in Venice, and was rewarded with the youth’s first
notable production, Orpheus and Eurydice , 27 In 1779, with Falier’s
approval, he set out for Rome. From that center he studied the remains
of ancient art. More and more he was won to Winckelmann’s interpretation
of Greek sculpture as aiming to represent</p>
<p>His friends in Venice persuaded the government to send him an annuity
of three hundred ducats for the next three years. This neither spoiled
him</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>nor deterred him. He frankly imitated classic models, and sometimes
seemed to equal them; so his Perseus and The Pugilist, both done in
1800, were the only modem works deemed worthy to stand in the Belvedere
of the Vatican beside world-acclaimed productions of classical
antiquity. 28 His Theseus Slaying the Centaur (1805) — a colossal marble
group now in the once Impe- rial Gardens of Vienna — could easily be
mistaken for an ancient masterpiece, were it not for the exaggeration of
muscles and fury. Canova was at his best in softer moods congenial to
his character, as in the Hebe of the National Gallery in Berlin; here
the daughter of Zeus and Hera is the goddess of youth, caught in the
mobile grace of dispensing wine to the gods.</p>
<p>In this fruitful year 1805 Canova began the most famous of his
statues — the Venus Victrix of the Galleria Borghese in Rome. He
persuaded Pauline Borghese, sister of Napoleon, to pose for this
sensuous figure. She was then twenty-five, at the perfection of her
form; but we are told 29 that the artist used only her face as his
model; for the drapery and the limbs he drew upon his imagination, his
dreams, and his memories. He finished the work in two years, and then
exposed it to the judgment of the public and his peers. They marveled at
its proud beauty and loving finish; here was no mere imitation of some
ancient masterpiece, but a living woman of her time, and, in her
brother’s judgment, the fairest. Canova made her a gift to the
generations.</p>
<p>In 1802 Napoleon asked Canova to come from Rome to Paris. Pope</p>
<p>Pius VII, having just signed a concordat with the Consul, advised
Canova to go, if only as one more Italian conqueror of France. Of the
several por- trait busts that the sculptor made of Napoleon, the most
pleasing is in the modest Musee Napoleon at Cap d’Antibes; there the
young warrior is a veritable Aristotle of meditation. Unreasonably more
famous is the full- length statue which Canova made in plaster and then
carved in one block of Carrara marble on his return to Rome. It was sent
to Paris in 18 1 1, and was set up in the Louvre; but Napoleon objected
to it, allegedly because the little Winged Victory placed in his right
hand seemed to be flying away from him. The figure was packed away out
of sight. In 1816 the British government bought it, and presented it to
Wellington. It now stands, eleven feet high, at the foot of the stairway
in Wellington’s Lond on palace, Apsley House. Canova came to Paris again
in 1810 to make a seated statue of Marie Louise. The result was not
prepossessing, but Napoleon gave the departing artist funds to repair
the Florence Cathedral, and for financing St. Luke’s Academy ( for
artists) in Rome. After Napoleon’s fall Canova was made head of the
commission appointed by the Pope to restore to their original owners the
art works that had been sent to Paris by French generals.</p>
<p>He stood at the top of the Italian sculptors of his time, and was
surpassed in Europe only by the now venerable Houdon (1741-1828). Byron,
who was more at home in Italy than in France, thought that “Europe— the
world —has but one Canova,” 30 and “Such as the great of yore, Canova is
to - day.” 31 Part of his acclaim may have been due to the neoclassic
wave that</p>
<p>55*5 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>cate the art of antiquity; soon the Romantic movement subordinated
line and form to color and feeling, and Canova’s fame faded.</p>
<p>It should not be irrelevant to add that Canova was a good man, known
for modesty, piety, and charity, and capable of appreciating his
competitors. He worked hard, and suffered from the malarial air of Rome,
and from carving massive monuments. In the summer of 1821 he left Rome,
and sought clearer air and a quieter life in his native Possagno. There,
on October 13, 1822, he died, aged sixty-four, mourned by all literate
Italy.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>VALE ITERUM ITALIA</li>
</ol>
<p>What was the algebraic total of the good and the evil done by France
in Italy in this age? To a nation drugged into lassitude by foreign rule
it brought the arousing cry and example of a nation rising in wrath and
achieving freedom by its own will and deed. It brought a new and chal-
lenging spirit into the relations of the citizens to the state. It
brought a Code Napoleon severe but constructive and defined, promoting
order and unity, and legal equality in a people long divided by class
and allergic to law. Na- poleon and his hard-working administrators
improved and cleansed the pro- cesses of government, expediting
performance, multiplying public works, adorning the cities, opening
boulevards and parks, clearing roads, marshes, and canals, establishing
schools, ending the Inquisition, encouraging agricul- ture and industry,
science and literature and art. The religion of the people was protected
by the new regime, but lost the power to suppress noncon- formity, and
was made to contribute to the expenses of the state. Conversely it was
the skeptic Napoleon who allotted funds to complete the Cathedral of
Milan. The whole procedure of law was quickened and reformed; torture
was outlawed, Latin was no longer required in the courts. In this period
(1789-1813) Joseph and Murat in Naples, Eugene in Milan, were blessings
to their realms, and would have been loved if they had been
Italians.</p>
<p>The other side of the picture was conscription, taxation, and expert
pil- fering. Napoleon put an end to brigandage, but he appropriated
works of art with such appreciation as perhaps they had ceased to
receive in an Italy saturated with masterpieces. In Napoleon’s v iew
conscription was the most rational and equitable method of protecting
the new nations from domestic disorder and foreign rule. “The Italians,”
he said, “should remember that arms are the principal support of a
state. It is time that the youths who live in idleness in the great
towns should cease to fear the fatigues and dangers of war.” Probably
conscription would have been accepted as a necessary evil had not
Italian conscripts found that they were expected to go anywhere to
protect the interests of Napoleon or France; so six thousand of them
were moved to the English Channel in 1803 to join in a problematical
invasion of England; eighty thousand of them 32 were pulled out of their
native sunshine to sample the plains and snows and Cossacks of
Russia.</p>
<p>Nor did the Italians agree about the patriotism of taxation. Here too
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) ITALY AND ITS CONQUERORS</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>labor of Italy went not only to protect, govern, and embellish Italy,
but also to help Napoleon meet the expenses of his expanding and
precarious empires. Eugene was expected to win the love of his subjects
while he was picking their pockets; taxes in his little kingdom rose
from 82 million francs in 1805 to 144 million in 1812. The Italians
added that such levies might have been more easily borne if the
Emperor’s Continental Blockade had not deprived Italian industry of its
English market, while export and import duties favoring France were
hurting Italian commerce with France and Germany.</p>
<p>So, even before the Austrians came back, the Italians had tired of
Napo- leon’s protectorate. They felt that they were not only losing
great art, but were being drained of the wealth they were creating in
order that France might invade England and conquer Russia. This was not
the dream their poets had dreamed. They admitted that the Pope’s
functionaries had al - lowed a high degree of corruption to enter into
the administration of the Papal States, but they did not like the rough
handling of Pius VII by French officers, nor his long imprisonment by
Napoleon’s command. At last they lost love even for the lovable Eugene,
for it was through his hands that many of Napoleon’s most unwelcome
edicts had been imposed; and when, after Leipzig, Napoleon was in danger
of complete defeat (1813), they re- fused to support Eugene’s efforts to
send him aid. The effort to liberate Italy through alien arms and rule
failed; liberation awaited the development of national unity through
native literature, statesmanship, and arms.</p>
<p>Napoleon himself, amid his many miscalculations, had foreseen these
dif- ficulties. In 1805 — the year of his coronation as king of Italy —
he said to Bourrienne:</p>
<p>The union of Italy with France can only be temporary, but it is
necessary in order to accustom the nations [states] of Italy to live
under common laws. The Genoese, the Piedmontese, the Venetians, the
Milanese, the inhabitants of Tuscany, the Romans, the Neapolitans, hate
one another…. Yet Rome is, from the recollections connected with it, the
natural capital of Italy. To make it so, however, it is necessary that
