<h4 id="chapter-ix-italia-felix">CHAPTER IX Italia Felix</h4>
<p>I 7 1 5~59</p>
<p>I. THE LANDSCAPE</p>
<p>D IVIDED into a dozen jealous states, Italy could not unite for its
own defense; the Italians were so busy relishing life that they
allowed</p>
<p>immature aliens to kill one another for the bitter fruit of politics
and the tainted spoils of war. So the golden peninsula became the
battleground of Bourbon Spain and France against Hapsburg Austria. A
succession of wars of succession ended in 1748 with Spain again holding
the kingdom of Naples and the duchy of Parma; the popes kept control of
the Papal States; Savoy, Venice, and San Marino remained free; Genoa and
Modena were French protectorates; Austria retained the Milanese and
Tuscany. Meanwhile the sun shone, the fields, vineyards, and orchards
gave food and drink, the women were beautiful and passionate, and arias
filled the air. Foreigners came as tourists and students to enjoy the
climate, the scenery, the theaters, the music, the art, and the society
of men and women dowered with the culture of centuries. Half conquered,
half despoiled, Italy, at least in the north, was the happiest country
in Europe.</p>
<p>Its population stood at some fourteen millions in 1700, about
eighteen millions in 1800. Less than half the land was arable, but of
that half every square foot was tilled with patient labor and skillful
care. Sloping terrain was terraced to hold the earth, and vines were
hung from tree to tree, gar- landing the orchards. In the south the soil
was poor; there the sardonically smiling sun dried up the rivers, the
earth, and man, and feudalism kept its medieval hold. A bitter proverb
said that “Christ had never gotten south of Eboli”— which was just south
of Sorrento. In central Italy the soil was fertile, and was tilled by
sharecroppers under ecclesiastical lords. In the north- above all in the
valley of the Po — the soil was enriched with irrigation canals; these
required capital outlays and a peasantry disciplined to dredge the beds
and shore the banks; here too the farmers tilled another man’s land for
a share in the crops. But in those teeming fields even poverty could be
borne with dignity.</p>
<p>A thousand villages took form on the plains, in the hills, by the
sea: dirty and dusty in the summer, noisy in the morning with talkative
labor slowing its pace to the heat, silent at noon, alive in the evening
with gossip, music, and amorous pursuits. More than money the Italians
loved their midday siesta, when, said Pere Labat, “one saw nothing in
the streets but dogs, fools, and Frenchmen.” 1 A hundred towns rich in
churches, palaces, beggars, and</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xart; half a dozen cities as beautiful as Paris; thousands of
artisans still at the top of their craft. Capitalistic industry was
again developing in textiles, es - pecially in Milan, Turin, Bergamo,
and Vicenza; but even in textiles most of the work was done at domestic
looms as part of family life. A small middle class (merchants, bankers,
manufacturers, lawyers, physicians, function- aries, journalists,
writers, artists, priests) was growing up between the aris- tocracy
(landowners and ecclesiastical hierarchy) and the “populace” (shop -
keepers, artisans, and peasantry), but it had as yet no political
power.</p>
<p>Class distinctions, except in Venice and Genoa, were not painfully
pro- nounced. In most Italian cities the nobles entered actively into
commerce, industry, or finance. The fact that any Italian peasant could
become a bishop or a pope infused a democratic element into social life;
at the court the possessor of an awesome pedigree rubbed elbows with a
prelate of humble birth; in the academies and universities intellectual
excellence outweighed the claims of caste; in the Carnival melee men and
women, at ease behind their masks, forgot their social grades as well as
their moral codes. Conversa- tion was as gay as in France, except for a
tacit agreement not to disturb a religion that brought international
tribute to Italy, even — especially — from her conquerors.</p>
<p>There was nothing puritanic about that religion; it had made its
peace with the nature of man and the climate of Italy. It allowed, in
the carnivals, a moratorium on modesty, but it labored to preserve the
institutions of mar- riage and the family against the credulity of women
and the imagination of men. In the literate classes girls were sent to a
convent at an early age — as early as their fifth year — not chiefly for
education but for moral surveil- lance. The eager product was released
only when a dowry had been raised for her, and some suitor, approved by
her parents or guardians, was prepared to offer her marriage.
Occasionally, if we may credit Casanova, a concupis- cent nun could
elude the mother superior — or the mother superior could elude her nuns
— and find a way to meet a concupiscent male between dusk and dawn; but
these were rare and perilous escapades. We cannot say as much for the
morals of the monks.</p>
<p>Generally the unmarried male, if he could not seduce a wife,
patronized prostitutes. The Comte de Caylus estimated eight thousand of
them at Naples in 1714 in a population of 150,000. President de Brosses,
in Milan, found that “one cannot take a step in the public squares
without encounter - ing pimps [courtiers de galanterie ] who offer you
women of whatever color or nationality you may desire; but you may
believe that the effect is not always as magnificent as the promise.” 2
In Rome the prostitutes were ex - cluded from the churches and public
assemblies, and were forbidden to sell their charms during Advent or
Lent, or on Sundays and holy days.</p>
<p>Their greatest cross was the accessibility of married women to
illicit devo- tion. These revenged themselves on their guarded
adolescence and unchosen mates by indulging in liaisons, and by adopting
a cavaliere servente. This custom of cicisbeatura, imported from Spain,
allowed a married woman, with her husband’s consent and in his absence,
to be attended by a “serving</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X219</p>
<p>gentleman” who accompanied her to dinner, to the theater, to society,
but rarely to bed. Some husbands chose cavalieri serventi for their
wives to keep these from unlawful loves. 3 The wide circulation of
Casanova’s Memoirs, and the hasty reports of French travelers accustomed
to French laxity, led to an exaggerated foreign conception of Italian
immorality. Crimes of violence or passion abounded, but by and large the
Italians were devoted children, jealous husbands, hard-working wives,
and fond parents, living a united family life, and facing the
tribulations of marriage and parent- age with dignity, volubility, and
resilient good cheer.</p>
<p>The education of women was not encouraged, for many men considered
literacy dangerous to chastity. A minority of girls received in convents
some instruction in reading, writing, embroidery, the arts of dressing
and pleasing. Yet we hear of well-educated women conducting salons in
which they conversed at ease with writers, artists, and men of affairs.
In Palermo Anna Gentile translated Voltaire into good Italian verse, and
published Lettere filosofiche in which she boldly defended the
nonreligious ethics of Helvetius. At Milan President de Brosses heard
Maria Gaetana Agnesi, aged twenty, lecture in Latin on hydraulics; 4 she
learned Greek, Hebrew, French, and English, and wrote treatises on conic
sections and analytical geometry. 5 At the University of Bologna Signora
Mazzolini taught anatomy, and Si- gnora Tambroni taught Greek. 6 At that
same university Laura Bassi received the doctorate in philosophy at the
age of twenty-one (1732); she soon ac- quired such erudition that she
was appointed to a professorship; she lectured on Newton’s Opticks, and
wrote treatises on physics; meanwhile she gave her husband twelve
children, and educated them herself. 7</p>
<p>The great majority in both sexes remained illiterate without social
con- tumely. If a village lad showed an alert and eager mind the priest
would usually find some way of getting him an education. Various
religious “con - gregations” organized schools in the towns. The Jesuits
had a great number of colleges in Italy — six in Venice, seven in the
Milanese, six in Genoa, ten in Piedmont, twenty-nine in Sicily, and many
in the kingdom of Naples and the Papal States. There were universities
at Turin, Genoa, Milan, Pavia, Pisa, Florence, Bologna, Padua, Rome,
Naples, and Palermo. All these were under control of Catholic
ecclesiastics, but there were many laymen on the faculties. Teachers and
students alike were sworn not to teach, read, say, or do anything
contrary to the doctrine of the Roman Church. At Padua, says Casanova,
“the Venetian government paid well -known professors very highly, and
left the students absolute liberty to follow their lessons and lec-
tures or not as they liked.” 8</p>
<p>In addition the Italian mind was stimulated by many academies devoted
to literature, science, or art, and usually free from priestly control.
Chief of these in fame was the Arcadian Academy, which was now in
genteel decay. There were public libraries, like the beautiful
Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan, or the Biblioteca Magliabechiana (now
Nazionale) at Florence; and many private libraries, like that of the
Pisani at Venice, were opened to the public on stated days of the week.
De Brosses reported that the libraries of</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XItaly were more frequently and zealously used than those of France.
Finally, there were periodicals of every sort — scholarly, literary, or
humorous. The Giornale dei letter ati d’ Italia, established in 1710 by
Apostolo Zeno and Francesco Scipione di Maffei, was one of the most
learned and respected journals in Europe.</p>
<p>All in all, Italy was enjoying a lively intellectual life. Poets
abounded, liv- ing from dedication to dedication; the air was powdered
with lyrics still echoing Petrarch; improvisatori competed in spawning
verses on the spur of the invitation; but there was no great poetry till
Alfieri closed the century. There were theaters at Venice, Vicenza,
Genoa, Turin, Milan, Florence, Padua, Naples, Rome; to these elegant
structures the elite and the common- alty came to converse and ogle as
well as to hear the opera or the play. There were great scholars like
Maffei, industrious historians like Muratori; soon there would be great
scientists. It was a slightly artificial culture, cau- tious under
censorship, and too courteous to be brave.</p>
<p>Even so, some fitful breezes of heresy came over the Alps or the sea.
For- eigners — chiefly Jacobite Englishmen — established in Genoa,
Florence, Rome, and Naples, from 1730 onward, Freemason lodges with a
tendency to deism. Popes Clement XII and Benedict XIV condemned them,
but they attracted numerous adherents, especially from the nobility,
occasionally from the clergy. Some books of Montesquieu, Voltaire,
Raynal, Mably, Condillac, Helvetius, d’Holbach, and La Mettrie were
imported into Italy. Editions of the Encyclopedic, in French, were
published at Lucca, Leghorn, and Padua. In a modest degree, in a form
available to persons who could read French, the Enlightenment reached
Italy. But the Italian deliberately, and for the most part contentedly,
refrained from philosophy. His bent and skill lay in the creation or
appreciation of art and poetry or music; a tangible or visible or
audible beauty seemed preferable to an elusive truth that was never
guaranteed to please. He let the world argue while he sang.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>Europe acknowledged the supremacy of Italian music, accepted its
instru- ments and forms, welcomed its virtues, crowned its castrati, and
surrendered to its melodious opera before, despite of, and after Gluck.
Gluck, Hasse, Mozart, and a thousand others went to Italy to study its
music, to learn the secrets of bel canto from Porpora, or to receive
Padre Martini’s accolade.</p>
<p>In Venice, said Burney, “if two persons are walking together arm in
arm, it seems as though they converse only in song. All the songs there
are duets.” 9 “In the Piazza di San Marco,” reported another Englishman,
“a man from the people — a shoemaker, a blacksmith — strikes up an air;
other persons of his sort, joining him, sing this air in several parts,
with an accuracy and taste which one seldom encounters in the best
society of our Northern countries.” 10</p>
<p>Lovers under a window plucked at a guitar or mandolin and a maiden’s
heart. Street singers carried their strains into coffeehouses and
taverns; in the</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X221</p>
<p>gondolas music caressed the evening air; salons, academies, and
theaters gave concerts; churches trembled with organs and choirs; at the
opera men melted and women swooned over some diva’s or castrato’s aria.
At a symphony con - cert given in Rome under the stars (1758) Morellet
heard such exclamations as “O benedetto! O che gusto! Piacer di morir!—
O blessed one! Oh, what delight! One could die of pleasure!” 11 It was
not unusual, at the opera, to hear sobbing in the audience.</p>
<p>Musical instruments were loved with more than sexual fidelity. Money
was lavished to make them objects of art, precisely fashioned in
precious wood, inlaid with ivory, enamel, or jewelry; diamonds might be
seen on harps or guitars. 12 Stradivari had left in Cremona pupils like
Giuseppe An- tonio Guarneri and Domenico Montagnana, who carried on the
secret of making violins, violas, and violoncellos with souls. The
harpsichord (which the Italians called clavicembalo ) remained to the
end of the eighteenth cen- tury the favorite keyboard instrument in
Italy, though Bartolommeo Cristo- fori had invented the piano-forte at
Florence about 1709. Virtuosi of the harpsichord like Domenico
Scarlatti, or of the violin like Tartini and Gemi- niani, had in this
age an international reputation. Francesco Geminiani was the Liszt of
the violin, or, as his rival Tartini called him, II Furibondo — “the
madman” of the bow. Coming to England in 1714, he became so popu - lar
in the British Isles that he stayed there through most of his final
eighteen years.</p>
<p>The rise of such virtuosi encouraged the production of instrumental
music; this was the golden age of Italian compositions for the violin.
Now — chiefly in Italy — overture, suite, sonata, concerto, and symphony
took form. All of them stressed melody and harmony rather than the
polyphonic counterpoint which was culminating and dying with Johann
Sebastian Bach. As the suite grew out of the dance, so the sonata grew
out of the suite. It was something sounded, as the cantata was something
sung. In the eighteenth century it became a sequence of three movements
— fast (allegro or presto), slow (an- dante or adagio), and fast (presto
or allegro), with sometimes the inter- polation of a scherzo (“joke”)
recalling the merry gigue, or a graceful minuet recalling the dance. By
1750 the sonata, at least in its first movement, had developed “sonata
form”— the exposition of contrasting themes, their elaboration through
variation, and their recapitulation toward the close. Through the
experiments of G. B. Sammartini and Rinaldo di Capua in Italy, and of
Johann Stamitz in Germany, the symphony evolved by apply- ing sonata
form to what had formerly been an operatic overture or recitative
accompaniment. In these ways the composer provided pleasure for the mind
as well as for the senses; he gave to instrumental music the added
artistic quality of a definite structure limiting and binding the
composition into logical order and unity. The disappearance of structure
— of the organic rela- tion of parts to a whole, or of beginning to
middle and end — is the degenera- tion of an art.</p>
<p>The concerto (Latin concertare, to contend) applied to music that
princi- ple of conflict which is the soul of drama: it opposed to the
orchestra a solo</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xperformer, and engaged them in harmonious debate. In Italy its
favorite form was the concerto grosso, where the opposition was between
a small orchestra of strings and a concertino of two or three virtuosi.
Now Vivaldi in Italy, Handel in England, and Bach in Germany brought the
concerto grosso to ever finer form, and instrumental music challenged
the pre-eminence of song.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, and above all in Italy, the voice continued to be the
favorite and incomparable instrument. There it had the advantage of a
euphonious language in which the vowel had conquered the consonant; of a
long tradi- tion of church music; and of a highly developed art of vocal
training. Here were the alluring prima donnas who yearly mounted the
scales in weight and wealth, and the plump castrati who went forth to
subdue kings and queens. These male sopranos or contraltos combined the
lungs and the larynx of a man with the voice of a woman or a boy.
Emasculated at the age of seven or eight, and subjected to a long and
subtle discipline of breathing and vocalization, they learned to perform
the trills and flourishes, the quavers and runs and breathtaking
cadenzas, that sent Italian audiences into a delirium of approval,
sometimes expressed by the exclamation “ Evviva il coltello !” (Long
live the little knife!) 13 The ecclesiastical opposition (especially at
Rome) to the employment of women on the stage, and the inferior training
of female singers in the seventeenth century, had created a demand which
the little knife supplied by cutting the seminal ducts. So great were
the re- wards of successful castrati that some parents, with the
victim’s induced consent, submitted a son to the operation at the first
sign of a golden voice. Expectations were often disappointed; in every
city of Italy, said Burney, numbers of these failures could be found,
“without any voice at all.” 14 After</p>
<p>The most famous name in eighteenth-century music was not Bach, nor
Handel, nor Mozart, but Farinelli — which was not his name. Carlo
Broschi apparently assumed the name of his uncle, who was already well
known in musical circles. Born in Naples (1705) of pedigreed parentage,
Carlo would not normally have entered the ranks of the unmanned; we are
told that an accident that befell him while riding compelled the
operation that resulted in the finest voice in history. He studied
singing with Porpora, accompanied him to Rome, and appeared there in
Porpora’s opera Eumene. In one aria he competed with a flutist in
holding and swelling a note, and so outpuffed him that invitations came
to him from a dozen capitals. In 1727, at Bologna, he met his first
defeat; he divided a duo with Antonio Bernacchi, acknowl- edged him as
“King of Singers,” and begged him to be his teacher. Ber - nacchi
consented, and was soon eclipsed by his pupil. Farinelli now went from
triumph to triumph in city after city — Venice, Vienna, Rome, Naples,
Ferrara, Lucca, Turin, London, Paris. His vocal technique was a wonder
of the age. The art of breathing was one secret of his skill; more than
any other singer he knew how to breathe deeply, quickly, imperceptibly,
and could hold a note while all musica l instruments gave out. In the
aria “Son qual nave” he began the first note with almost inaudible
delicacy, expanded it</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X22 3</p>
<p>gradually to full volume, and then reduced it by degrees to its first
faintness. Sometimes an audience, even in staid England, would applaud
this curiosa felicitas for five minutes. 15 He won his hearers also by
his pathos, grace, and tenderness; and these qualities were in his
nature as well as in his voice. In 1737 he made what he thought would be
a brief visit to Spain; he remained in or near Madrid for a quarter of a
century. We shall look for him there.</p>
<p>With castrati like Farinelli and Senesino, with divas like Faustina
Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni, opera became the voice of Italy, and, as
such, was heard with delight everywhere in Europe except in France,
where it stirred a war. Originally opera was the plural of opus , and
meant works; in Italian the plural became singular, still meaning work;
what we now call opera was termed opera per musica — a musical work;
only in the eighteenth century did the word take on its present meaning.
Influenced by traditions of the Greek drama, it had been designed
originally as a play accompanied by music; soon, in Italy, the music
dominated the play, and arias dominated the music. Operas were planned
to give display solos to each prima donna and each prvmo uomo in the
cast. Between these exciting peaks the auditors con- versed; between the
acts they played cards or chess, gambled, ate sweets, fruit, or hot
suppers, and visited and flirted from box to box. In such feasts the
libretto was regularly drowned in an intermittent cascade of arias,
duets, choruses, and ballets. The historian Lodovico Muratori denounced
this sub- mergence of poetry (1701); 16 the librettist Apostolo Zeno
agreed with him; the composer Benedetto Marcello satirized this tendency
in T eatro alia moda (1721). Metastasio for a time stemmed the torrent,
but rather in Austria than in Italy; Jommelli and Traetta struggled
against it, but were repudiated by their countrymen. The Italians
frankly preferred music to poetry, and took the drama as mere
scaffolding for song.</p>
<p>Probably no other art form in history ever enjoyed such popularity as
opera in Italy. No enthusiasm could compare with an Italian audience
wel- coming an aria or a cadenza by a singer of renown. To cough during
such a ceremony was a social felony. Applause began before the familiar
song was finished, and was reinforced by canes beating upon floors or
the backs of chairs; some devotees tossed their shoes into the air. 17
Every Italian town of any pride (and which of them was without pride?)
had its opera house; there were forty in the Papal States alone. Whereas
in Germany opera was usually a court function closed to the public, and
in England it limited its audience by high prices of admission, in Italy
it was open to all decently dressed persons at a modest charge,
sometimes at no charge at all. And as the Italians were devoted to the
enjoyment of life, they insisted that their operas, however tragic,
should have a happy ending. Moreover, they liked humor as well as
sentiment. The custom grew to interpolate comic intermezzi be- tween the
acts of an opera; these interludes developed into a genus of their own,
until they rivaled opera seria in popularity, and sometimes in length.
It was an opera buff a — Pergolesi’s La serva padrona— xhzt charmed
Paris in 1752, and was acclaimed by Rousseau as attesting the
superiority of Italian music over French.</p>
<p>Buffa or seria, Italian opera was a force in history. As Rome had

<p>Xconquered Western Europe with her armies, as the Roman Church had
conquered it again with her creed, so Italy conquered it once more, with
opera. Her operas displaced native productions in Germany, Denmark, Eng-
land, Portugal, Spain, even in Russia; her singers were the idols of
almost every European capital. Native singers, to win acceptance at
home, took Italian names. That enchanting conquest will go on as long as
vowels can outsing consonants.</p>

<li>RELIGION</li>
</ol>
<p>After the prima donnas and the great castrati , the dominant class in
Italy was the clergy. In their distinctive cassocks and under their
broad-rimmed hats they walked or rode in proud freedom across the
Italian scene, knowing that they dispensed the most precious boon known
to humanity — hope. Whereas in France there was in this century
approximately one ecclesiastic for each two hundred souls, in Rome there
was one for fifteen, in Bologna one for seventeen, in Naples and Turin
one for twenty-eight. 18 A con- temporary Neapolitan, professedly
orthodox, complained:</p>
<p>So greatly have the clergy increased in number that the princes must
either take measures to restrict them, or allow them to engulf the whole
of the state. Why is it necessary that the smallest Italian village
should be controlled by fifty or sixty priests?… The great number of
campaniles and convents shuts out the sun. There are cities with as many
as twenty-five convents of friars or sisters of St. Dominic, seven
colleges of Jesuits, as many of Theatines, about twenty or thirty
monasteries of Franciscan friars, and a good fifty others of dif- ferent
religious orders of both the sexes, not to speak of four or five hundred
churches and chapels. 19</p>
<p>Perhaps these figures were exaggerated for argument. We hear of four
hundred churches in Naples, 260 in Milan, no in Turin; these, however,
included small chapels. The monks were relatively poor, but the secular
clergy, as a whole, possessed more wealth than the nobility. In the
kingdom of Naples the clergy received a third of the revenues. In the
duchy of Parma one half, in Tuscany almost three quarters, of the soil
belonged to the clergy. In Venice, in the eleven years from 1755 to
*765, new legacies added 3,300,- 000 ducats’ worth o f property to the
Church. 20 Some cardinals and bishops were among the richest men in
Italy, but cardinals and bishops were primar- ily administrators and
statesmen, only occasionally saints. Several of them, in the second half
of the century, renounced their wealth and luxury, and led lives of
voluntary poverty.</p>
<p>The Italian people, barring a few publicists or satirists, made no
significant protest against the wealth of the clergy. They took pride in
the splendor of their churches, monasteries, and prelates. Their
contributions seemed a small price to pay for the order that religion
brought to the family and the state. Every home had a crucifix, and an
image of the Virgin; before these the family — parents, children, and
servants — knelt in prayer each evening;</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X225</p>
<p>what could replace the moral influence of those unifying prayers? The
abstinence from meat on Fridays, and on Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent,
was a wholesome discipline of desire — and was a boon to health and
fisher- men. The priests, who themselves knew the charms of women, were
not too hard on sins of the flesh, and winked an eye at the laxities of
Carnival. Even the prostitutes, on Saturdays, lit a candle before the
Virgin, and deposited money for a Mass. De Brosses, attending a play in
Verona, was astonished to see the performance stop when church bells
rang the Angelus; all the actors knelt and prayed; an actress who had
fallen in a dramatic faint rose to join in the prayer, and then fainted
again. 21 Seldom has a religion been so loved as Catholicism in
Italy.</p>
<p>There was another side to the picture — censorship and Inquisition.
The Church demanded that every Italian, at least once a year, perform
his or her “Easter duty”— go to confession on Holy Saturday, and receive
Communion on Easter morn. Failure to do this brought — in all but the
largest cities — priestly reproof; failure of private reproof and
exhortation brought public lis ting of the recusant’s name on the doors
of the parish church; continued refusal brought excommunication and, in
some towns, imprisonment. 22 The Inquisition, however, had lost much of
its power and bite. In the larger cen- ters ecclesiastical surveillance
could be evaded, censorship was reduced, and there was a silent spread
of doubt and heresy in the intelligentsia, even in the clergy themselves
— for some of these, despite papal bulls, were secret Jansenists.</p>
<p>While many priests and monks led easy lives, and were no strangers to
sin, there were also many who were faithful to their vows, and kept the
faith alive by devotion to their tasks. New religious foundations
testified to the survival of the monastic impulse. St. Alfonso de’
Liguori, a lawyer of noble lineage, founded in 1732 the “Redemptorists”—
i.e., the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer; and St. Paul of the
Cross (Paolo Danei), who prac- ticed the most severe ascetic ism,
founded in 1737 the “Passionist Order”— i.e., the Clerks of the Holy
Cross and Passion of Our Lord.</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) had in 1750 some 23,000 members,
3,622 of them in Italy, half of them priests. 23 Their power was quite
out of proportion to their number. As confessors to kings, queens, and
prominent families they often influenced domestic and international
politics, and they were sometimes the most urgent force — next to the
populace itself — in the persecution of heresy. Yet they were the most
liberal of the Catholic theolo- gians; we have seen elsewhere how
patiently they sought a compromise with the French Enlightenment. A
similar flexibility marked their foreign mis- sions. In China they
converted “several hundred thousands” to Catholicism, 24 but their
intelligent concessions to ancestor worship, to Confucianism, and to
Taoism shocked the missionaries of other orders; and these persuaded
Pope Benedict XIV to check and reprove the Jesuits in the bull Ex quo
singulari ( 1 743 ). They remained nevertheless the most able and
learned de- fenders of the Catholic faith against Protestantism and
unbelief, and the most loyal supporters of the popes against the kings.

<li>FROM TURIN TO FLORENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>Entering Italy from France by Mont-Cenis, we descend the Alps into
“foot -of-the- mountain” Piedmont, and pass through vineyards, fields of
grain, and orchards of olive or chestnut trees to two-thousand-year-old
Turin, ancient citadel of the house of Savoy. This is one of the oldest
royal families in existence, founded in 1003 by Umberto Biancamano —
Humbert of the White Hand. Its head in this period was among the ablest
rulers of the time. Victor Amadeus II inherited the ducal throne of
Savoy at the age of nine (1675), took charge at eighteen, fought now
for, now against, the French in the wars of Louis XIV, shared with
Eugene of Savoy in driving the French from Turin and Italy, and emerged
from the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) with Sicily added to his crown. In
1718 he exchanged Sicily for Sardinia; he took the title of King of
Sardinia (1720), but kept Turin as his capital. He governed with brusque
competence, improved public education, raised the general prosperity,
and, after fifty-five years of rule, abdicated in favor of his son
Charles Emmanuel I (r. 1730-73).</p>
<p>During these two reigns, covering almost a century, Turin was a
leading center of Italian civilization. Montesquieu, seeing it in 1728,
called it “the</p>
<p>Milan, long stifled by Spanish domination, revived under the milder
Aus- trian rule. In 1703 Franz Tieffen, in 1746 and 1755 Felice and Rho
Clerici, aided by the government, established textile factories that
extended the re- placement of handicrafts and guilds with large-scale
production under capitalistic financing and management. — In the
cultural history of Milan the great name was now Giovanni Battista
Sammartini, whom we can still hear occasionally over the affluent air.
In his symphonies and sonatas the contra-</p>

<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X227</p>
<p>puntal solemnity of the German masters was replaced by a dynamic
interplay of contrasted themes and moods. The young Gluck, coming to
Milan (1737) as chamber musician to Prince Francesco Melzi, became the
pupil and friend of Sammartini, and adopted his method of constructing
an opera. In 1770 the Bohemian composer Josef Myslivecek, listening with
the youthful Mozart to some of Sammartini’s symphonies in Milan,
exclaimed, “I have found the father of Haydn’s style!” 27 — and
therefore one of the fathers of the modern symphony.</p>
<p>Genoa had a bad eighteenth century. Its commerce had declined through
the competition of the oceans with the Mediterranean, but its strategic
loca- tion on a defensive hill overlooking a well-equipped port
attracted the dan- gerous attention of neighboring powers. Placed
between enemies without and an uneducated but passionate populace
within, the government fell into the hands of old commercial families
ruling through a closed council and an obedient doge. This
self-perpetuating oligarchy taxed the people into a sullen and impatient
poverty, and was in turn dominated and fleeced by the Banco di San
Giorgio. When the allied forces of Savoy and Austria besieged Genoa in 1
746 the government did not dare arm the people to resist, for fear they
would kill the rulers; it preferred to open the gates to the besiegers,
who exacted indemnities and ransoms that broke the bank. The commonalty,
preferring indigenous exploiters, rose against the Austrian garrison,
bom- barded it with tiles and stones torn from roofs and streets, and
drove it igno- miniously out. The old tyranny was resumed.</p>
<p>The Genoese patriciate built new mansions like the Palazzo Deferrari,
and shared with Milan in supporting a painter who has come to a second
fame in our time. Almost every extant picture by Alessandro Magnasco
strikes us with the dark originality of its style. Punchinello Playing
the Guitar 28 — an elongated figure in careless patches of black and
brown; the graceful Girl and Musician before the Fire ; 29 The Barber,
30 apparently eager to cut his client’s throat; the massive Refector y
of the Monks 81 attesting the culinary prosperity of the Church: all
these are masterpieces, recalling El Greco in their gaunt forms and
tricks of light, anticipating Goya in macabre exposure of life’s
cruelties, and almost modernistic in rough disdai n of prim detail.
Florence in this age saw the end of one of history’s most famous
families. The prolonged reign of Cosimo III (1670-1723) as Grand Duke of
Tuscany was a misfortune for a people still proud with memories of
Florentine gran- deur under the earlier Medici. Obsessed with theology,
Cosimo allowed the clergy to govern him and draw from his ailing
revenues rich endowments for the Church. Despotic rule, incompetent
administration, and exorbitant taxa- tion forfeited the popular support
that the dynasty had enjoyed for 250 years.</p>
<p>Cosimo’s eldest son, Ferdinand, preferred courtesans to courtiers,
ruined his health with excesses, and died childless in 1713. Another
son, “Gian” (John) Gastone, took to books, studied history and botany,
and lived a quiet</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xlife. In 1697 his father forced him to marry Anne of Saxe-Lauenburg,
a widow of unfurnished mind. Gian went to live with her in a remote Bo-
hemian village, bore boredom for a year, then consoled himself with
adul- teries in Prague. When Ferdinand’s health failed, Cosimo called
Gian back to Florence; when Ferdinand died Gian was named heir to the
grand-ducal crown. Gian’s wife refused to liv e in Italy. Cosimo,
fearing extinction of the Medici line, persuaded the Florentine Senate
to decree that on the death of the childless Gian Gastone, Gian’s sister
Anna Maria Ludovica should suc - ceed to the throne.</p>
<p>The European powers fluttered eagerly around the dying dynasty. In
1718 Austria, France, England, and Holland refused to recognize Cosimo’s
ar - rangement, and declared that on Gian’s death Tuscany and Parma
should be given to Don Carlos, eldest son of Elizabeth Farnese, Queen of
Spain. Cosimo protested, and belatedly reorganized the military defenses
of Leg- horn and Florence. His death left to his son an impoverished
state and a pre- carious throne.</p>
<p>Gian Gastone was now (1732) fifty-two years old. He labored to remedy
abuses in the administration and the economy, dismissed the spies and
syco- phants who had fattened under his father, reduced taxes, recalled
exiles, re- leased political prisoners, assisted the revival of industry
and commerce, and restored the social life of Florence co security and
gaiety. The enrichment of the Uffizi Gallery by Cosimo II and Gian
Gastone, the flourishing of music under the lead of Francesco Veracini’s
violin, the masked balls, the parades of decorated carriages, the
popular battles of confetti and flowers, made Florence rival Venice and
Rome in attracting foreign visitors; here, for example, about 1740, Lady
Alary Wortley Montagu, Horace Walpole, and Thomas Gray gathered around
Lady Henrietta Pomfret in the Palazzo Ridolfo. There is something
wistfully attractive in a society in decay.</p>
<p>Exhausted by his efforts, Gian Gastone in 1731 turned the government
over to his ministers, and slipped into sensual degradation. Spain sent
an army of thirty thousand men to ensure Don Carlos ’ succession;
Charles VI of Austria sent fifty thousand troops to escort his daughter
Maria Theresa to the grand-ducal throne. War was averted by an agreement
(1736) among Austria, France, England, and Holland that Carlos should
have Naples, and that Tuscany should go to Maria Theresa and her
husband, Francis of Lor- raine. On July 9, 1737, the last of the Medici
rulers died, Tuscany became a dependency of Austria, and Florence
flowered again.</p>
<p>V. QUEEN OF THE ADRIATIC</p>
<p>Between Milan and Venice some minor cities lolled in the sun. Bergamo
had to be content, in this half century, with painters like Ghislandi,
com- posers like Locatelli. Verona presented operas in her Roman
theater, and had an outstanding man in Marchese Francesco Scipione di
Maffei. His poetic drama Merope (1713) was imitated by Voltaire, who
honorably dedicated</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X229</p>
<p>his own Merope to him as “the first who had courage and genius enough
to hazard a tragedy without gallantry, a tragedy worthy of Athens in its
glory, wherein maternal affection constitutes the whole intrigue, and
the most tender interest arises from the purest virtue.” 32 Even more
distinguished was Maffei’s scholarly Verona illustrata (1731 -32), which
set a pace for archae- ology. His city was so proud of him that it
raised a statue to him in his lifetime. — Vicenza, with its buildings by
Palladio, was a goal of pilgrimage for architects reviving the classic
style. — Padua had a university then espe- cially noted for its
faculties of law and medicine, and it had Giuseppe Tartini, acknowledged
by all (except Geminiani) to be at the head of Europe’s violinists; who
has not heard Tartini’s “Devil’s Trill”?</p>
<p>All these cities were part of the Venetian Republic. So, in the
north, were Treviso, Friuli, Feltre, Bassano, Udine, Belluno, Trento,
Bolzano; so in the east was Istria; in the south the state of Venezia
extended through Chioggia and Rovigo to the Po; across the Adriatic it
held Cattaro, Preveza, and other parts of today’s Yugoslavia and
Albania; and in the Adriatic it held the islands of Corfu, Cephalonia,
and Zante. Within this complex realm dwelt some three million souls,
each the center of the world.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Venetian Life</li>
</ol>
<p>Venice herself, as the capital, contained 137,000 inhabitants. She
was now in political and economic decline, having lost her Aegean empire
to the Turks, and much of her foreign commerce to Atlantic states. The
failure of the Crusades; the unwillingness of the European governments,
after the vic- tory at Lepanto (1571)^0 help Venice defend the outposts
of Christendom in the East; the eagerness of those governments to accept
from Turkey commercial privileges denied to her bravest enemy 33 — these
developments had left Venice too weak to maintain her Renaissance
splendor. She decided to cultivate her own garden — to give to her
Italian and Adriatic possessions a government severe in law, political
censorship, and personal supervision, but competent in administration,
tolerant in religion and morals, liberal in internal trade.</p>
<p>Like the other republics of eighteenth-century Europe, Venice was
ruled by an oligarchy. In the flotsam of diverse stocks — Antonios,
Shylocks, Othel- los — with a populace poorly educated, slow to think
and quick to act, and preferring pleasure to power, democracy would have
been chaos enthroned. Eligibility to the Gran Consiglio was generally
restricted to some six hun- dred families listed in the Libro (Toro; but
to that native aristocracy some judicious additions were made from the
ranks of merchants and financiers, even though of alien blood. The Great
Council chose the Senate, which chose the powerful Council of Ten. A
swarm of spies circulated silently among the citizens, reporting to the
lnquisitori any suspicious action or speech of any Venetian — of the
doge himself. The doges were now usually figureheads, serving to
polarize patriotism and adorn diplomacy.</p>
<p>The economy was fighting a losing battle against foreign competition,
im-</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xport dues, and guild restraints. Venetian industry did not expand
into free enterprise, free trade, and capitalistic management; it was
content with the fame of its crafts. The wool industry, which had
fifteen hundred employees in 1700, had only six hundred at the end of
the century; the silk industry declined in the same period from twelve
thousand to one thousand. 34 The glass workers of Murano resisted any
change in the methods that had once brought them European renown; their
secrets escaped to Florence, France, Bohemia, England; their rivals
responded to advances in chemistry, to ex- periments in manufacture; the
Murano ascendancy passed. The lace industry similarly succumbed to
competitors beyond the Alps; by 1750 the Venetians. themselves were
wearing French lace. Two industries flourished: fisheries, which
employed thirty thousand men, and the importation and sale of
slaves.</p>
<p>Religion was not allowed to interfere with the profits of trade or
the pleasures of life. The state regulated all matters concerning
ecclesiastical property and clerical crime. The Jesuits, expelled in
1606, had been recalled in 1657, but under conditions that checked their
influence in education and politics. Despite a governmental ban on the
importation of works by the French philosophers, the doctrines of
Voltaire, Rousseau, Helvetius, and Diderot found their way, if only by
visitors, into Venetian salons, and in Venice, as in France, the
aristocracy toyed with the ideas that sapped its power. 35 The people
accepted religion as an almost unconscious habit of ritual and belief,
but they played more often than they prayed. A Venetian proverb
described Venetian morals with all the inadequacy of an epigram: “In the
morning a little Mass, after dinner a little gamble, in the evening a
little woman.” 36 Young men went to church not to worship the Virg in
but to examine the women, and these, despite ecclesiastical and
governmental fulminations, dressed decollete. 37 The perennial war
between religion and sex was giving sex the victory.</p>
<p>The government permitted a regulated prostitution as a measure of
public safety. The courtesans of Venice were famous for their beauty,
good man- ners, rich raiment, and sumptuous apartments on the Grand
Canal. The supply of cortigiane was considerable, but still fell short
of the demand. Thrifty Venetians, and aliens like Rousseau, clubbed
together, two or three, to maintain one concubine. 38 Despite these
facilities, and not content with cavalieri serventi, married women
indulged in liaisons dangereuses. Some of them frequented the casinos,
in which every convenience was provided for assignations. Several noble
ladies were publicly reproved by the government for loose conduct; some
were ordered confined to their homes; some were exiled. The middle
classes showed more sobriety; a succession of offspring kept the wife
busy, and filled her need for receiving and giving love. No- where did
mothers lavish more ardent endearments upon their children — “// mio
leon di San Marco ! La mia allegrezza! 11 viio fior di prhnavera!” (My
lion of St. Mark! My joy! My flower of spring! )</p>
<p>Crime was less frequent in Venice than elsewhere in Italy; the arm
ready to strike was held back by the abundance and watchfulness of
constables and gendarmes. But gambling was accepted as a natural
occupation of mankind.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X2 3 I</p>
<p>The government organized a lottery in 1715. The first ridotto, or
gambling casino, was opened in 1638; soon there were many, public or
private, and all classes hastened to them. Clever sharpers like Casanova
could live on their gambling gains; others could lose the savings of a
year in a night. The play- ers, some masked, bent over the table in a
silent devotion more intense than love. The government looked on amiably
(till 1774), for it taxed the ridotti, and received some 300,000 lire
from them in annual revenue. 39</p>
<p>Moneyed idlers came from a dozen states to spend their savings, or
their declining years, in the relaxed morals and plein-air gaiety of the
piazzas and the canals. The abandonment of empire lowered the fever of
politics. No one here talked of revolution, for every class, besides its
pleasures, had its stabilizing customs, its absorption in accepted
tasks. Servants were pliant and faithful, but they brooked no insult or
contumely. The gondoliers were poor, but they were the lords of the
lagoons, standing on their gilded barks in the confident pride of their
ancient skill, or rounding a turn with lusty esoteric cries, or
murmuring a song to the sway of their bodies and the rhythm of their
oars.</p>
<p>Many different nationalities mingled in the piazzas, each keeping its
dis- tinctive garb, language, and profanity. The upper classes still
dressed as in the heyday of the Renaissance, with shirts of finest
linen, velvet breeches, silk stockings, buckled shoes; but it was the
Venetians who in this century introduced to Western Europe the Turkish
custom of long trousers — pan- taloons. Wigs had come in from France
about 1665. Young fops took such care of their dress, hair, and smell
that their sex was imperceptible. Women of fashion raised upon their
heads fantastic towers of false or natural hair. Men as well as women
felt undressed without jewelry. Fans were works of art, elegantly
painted, often encrusted with gems or enclosing a monocle.</p>
<p>Every class had its clubs, every street its caffe; “in Italy,” said
Goldoni, “we take ten cups of coffee every day.” 40 All kinds of
amusement flourished, from prize fights ( pugni ) to masked balls. One
game, pallone — tossing an inflated ball about with the palm of the hand
— gave us our word balloon. Water sports were perennial. Ever since 1315
a regatta had been held on January 25 on the Grand Canal — a race
between galleys rowed by fifty oars and decorated like our “floats”; and
the festival was climaxed by a water polo game in which hundreds of
Venetians divided into shouting and com- peting groups. On Ascension Day
the doge sailed in glory from San Marco to the Lido on the richly
decorated ship of state, the Bucintoro (Bucentaur ) , amid a thousand
other craft, to remarry Venice to the sea.</p>
<p>Saints and historical anniversaries lent their names and memories to
fre- quent holidays, for the Senate found that bread and circuses were
an accept- able substitute for elections. On such occasions picturesque
processions passed from church to church, from square to square;
colorful carpets, garlands and silks were hung from windows or balconies
on the route; there was intelligible music, pious or amorous song, and
graceful dancing in the streets. Patricians chosen for high office
celebrated their victories with pa- rades, arches, trophies,
festivities, and philanthropies costing sometimes</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>2 3 2</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xhirty thousand ducats. Every wedding was a festival, and the funeral
of a dignitary was the grandest event in his career.</p>
<p>And there was Carnival — the Christian legacy from the Saturnalia of
pagan Rome. Church and state hoped that by allowing a moral holiday they
could reduce, for the remainder of the year, the tension between the
flesh and the Sixth Commandment. Usually, in Italy, Carnevale extended
only through the last week before Lent; in eighteenth-century Venice,
from December 2 6 or January 7 to Martedi Grasso (“Fat Tuesday,” Mardi
Gras); perhaps from that final day of permissible meat-eating the
festival took its name — carne-vale, farewell to flesh food. Almost
every night in those winter weeks the Venetians — and visitors
converging from all Europe — poured into the piazzas, dressed in gay
colors, and hiding age, rank, and identity behind a mask. In that
disguise many men and women laughed at laws, and harlots thrived.
Confetti flew about, and artifical eggs were cast around to spread their
scented waters when they broke. Pantalone, Arlechino, Columbine, and
other beloved characters from the comic theater pranced and prattled to
amuse the crowd; puppets danced, rope walkers stopped a thousand
breaths. Strange beasts were brought in for the occasion, like the
rhinoceros, which was first seen in Venice in the festivities of 1751.
Then, at midnight before Ash Wednesday (Mercoledi della Ceneri) , the
great bells of San Marco tolled the end of Carnival; the exhausted
reveler returned to his legal bed, and prepared to hear his priest tell
him on the morrow, “ Memento , homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem
redieris ” (Remember, man, that thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt
return).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Vivaldi</li>
</ol>
<p>Venice and Naples were the rival foci of music in Italy. In its
theaters Venice heard twelve hundred different operas in the eighteenth
century. There the most renowned divas of the age, Francesca Cuzzoni and
Faustina Bordoni, fought their melodious battles for supremacy; and each
from one foot of board moved the world. Cuzzoni sang opposite Farinelli
in one theater, Bordoni sang opposite Bernacchi in another, and all
Venice was divided between their worshipers. If all four had sung
together the Queen of the Adriatic would have melted into her
lagoons.</p>
<p>At antipodes to these citadels of opera and joy were the four
ospedali, or asylums, in which Venice cared for some of her orphan or
illegitimate girls. To give function and meaning to the lives of these
homeless children they were trained in vocal and instrumental music, to
sing in choirs, and to give public concerts from behind their
semi-monastic grills. Rousseau said he had never heard anything so
touching as these girlish voices singing in disciplined harmony; 41
Goethe thought he had never heard so exquisite a soprano, or music “of
such ineffable beauty.” 42 Some of the greatest of Italy’s composers
taught in these institutions, wrote music for them, and conducted their
con- certs: Monteverdi, Cavalli, Lotti, Galuppi, Porpora, Vivaldi…</p>
<p>To supply her theaters with operas, to furnish her ospedali,
orchestras,</p>
<p>CHAP. IX ) ITALIA FELIX 233</p>
<p>and virtuosi with vocal and instrumental music, Venice called upon
the cities of Italy, sometimes of Austria and Germany. She herself was
the mother or nurse of Antonio Lotti, organist and then maestro di
capella at St. Mark’s, author of indifferent ope ras but of a Mass that
brought tears to Protestant Burney’s eyes; of Baldassare Galuppi, famous
for his opera buffe, and for the splendor and tenderness of his operatic
airs; of Alessandro Mar- cello, whose concertos rank high in the
compositions of his time; of his younger brother Benedetto, whose
musical setting of fifty psalms “constitute one of the finest
productions of musical literature”; 48 and of Antonio Vivaldi.</p>
<p>To some of us the first hearing of a Vivaldi concerto was a
humiliating revelation. Why had we been ignorant of him so long? Here
was a stately flow of harmony, laughing ripples of melody, a unity of
structure and a cohesion of parts, which should have won this man an
earlier entry into our ken, and a higher place in our musical
histories.*</p>
<p>He was born about 1675, son of a violinist in the orchestra of the
Doges’ Chapel in St. Mark’s. His father taught him the violin, and
obtained a place for him in the orchestra. At fifteen he took minor
orders; at twenty-five he became a priest; he was called II Prete Rosso
because his hair was red. His passion for music may have conflicted with
his sacerdotal ministrations. Enemies said that “one day, when Vivaldi
was saying Mass, a subject for a fugue came to his mind; he at once left
the altar,… and repaired to the sacristy to write out the theme; then he
came back to finish Mass.” 44 A papal nuncio charged him with keeping
several women, and finally (it was said) the Inquisition forbade him to
say Mass. Antonio in later years gave quite a different account:</p>
<p>It was twenty-five years ago that I said Mass for… the last time, not
due to interdiction,… but by my own decision, because of an ailment that
has burdened me since birth. After being ordained a priest I said Mass
for a year or a little more; then I ceased to say it, having on three
occasions been com- pelled by this ailment to leave the altar without
completing it.</p>
<p>For this same reason I nearly always live at home, and I only go out
in a gondola or coach, because I can no longer walk on account of this
chest con- dition, or rather this tightness in the chest [strettezza di
petto, probably asthma]. No nobleman invites me to his house, not even
our prince, because all are informed of my ailment. My travels have
always been very costly because I have always had to make them with four
or five women to help me.</p>
<p>These women, he added, were of spotless repute. “Their modesty was ad
- mitted everywhere…. Every day of the week they made their devo-
tions.” 45</p>
<p>He could not have been much of a rake, for the Seminario Musicale
dell’ Ospedale della Pieta kept him through thirty-seven years as
violinist, teacher, composer, or maestro di coro — rector of the choir.
For his girl students he composed most of his nonoperatic works. The
demands were great; hence he wrote in haste and corrected at what
leisure he could find; he told de Brosses</p>
<p>The 1928 edition of Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians gave
him one column; the 1954 edition gave him twelve; judge from this the
sudden expansion of Vivaldi’s reputation. Is fame a whim of chance?</p>
<p>234 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xhat he could “compose a concerto faster than a copyist could copy
it.” 46 His operas were equally hurried; one of them bore on the title
page the boast (or excuse) “ Fatto in cinque giorni”— Done in five days.
Like Handel, he saved time by borrowing from himself, adapting past
performances to meet present needs.</p>
<p>In the interstices of his work at the Ospedale he composed forty
operas. Many contemporaries agreed with Tartini that they were mediocre;
Bene- detto Marcello made fun of them in his T eatro alia moda; but
audiences in Venice, Vicenza, Vienna, Mantua, Florence, Milan, and
Vienna welcomed him, and Vivaldi often deserted his girls to travel with
his women through northern Italy, even to Vienna and Amsterdam, to
perform as a violinist, or to conduct one of his operas, or to supervise
its staging and decor. His operas are now dead, but so are nearly all
those composed before Gluck. Styles, manners, heroes, voices, sexes have
changed.</p>
<p>History knows of 554 compositions by Vivaldi; of these 454 are
concertos. A clever satirist said that Vivaldi had not written six
hundred concertos, but had written the same concerto six hundred times;
47 and sometimes it seems so. There is in these pieces much sawing of
strings, much hurdy-gurdy con - tinuo , an almost metronomic beating of
time; even in the famous series called The Seasons (1725) there are some
deserts of monotony. But there are also peaks of passionate vitality and
wintry blasts, oases of dramatic con- flict between soloists and
orchestra, and grateful streams of melody. In such pieces 48 Vivaldi
brought the concerto grosso to an unprecedented excellence, which only
Bach and Handel would surpass.</p>
<p>Like most artists, Vivaldi suffered from the sensitivity that fed his
genius. The power of his music reflected his fiery temper, the
tenderness of his strains reflected his piety. As he aged he became
absorbed in religious devo- tions, so that one fanciful record described
him as leaving his rosary only to compose. 49 In 1740 he lost or
resigned his post at the Ospedale della Pieta. For reasons now unknown
he left Venice and went to Vienna. We know nothing further of him except
that there, a year later, he died, and received a pauper’s funeral.</p>
<p>His death passed unnoticed in the Italian press, for Venice had
ceased to care for his music, and no one ranked him near the top of his
art in his land and time. His compositions found a welcome in Germany.
Quantz, flutist and composer for Frederick the Great , imported
Vivaldi’s concertos, and frankly accepted them as models. Bach so
admired them as to transpose at least nine for the harpsichord, four for
the organ, and one for four harpsi- chords and a string ensemble. 50
Apparently it was from Vivaldi and Corelli that Bach derived the
tripartite structure of his concertos.</p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth century Vivaldi was almost forgotten except
by scholars tracing the development of Bach. Then in 1905 Arnold Scher-
ing’s Geschichte des Instrumentalkonzer ts restored him to prominence;
and in the 1920s Arturo Toscanini gave his passion and prestige to
Vivaldi’s cause. Today the Red Priest takes for a time the highest place
among the Italian composers of the eighteenth century.</p>

<li>Remembrances</li>
</ol>
<p>From the Indian summer of Venetian art a dozen painters rise up and
ask for remembrance. We merely salute Giambattista Pittoni, whom Venice
placed only after Tiepolo and Piazzetta; and Jacopo Amigoni, whose
voluptu- ous style passed down to Boucher; and Giovanni Antonio
Pellegrini, who carried his colors to England, France, and Germany; it
was he who decor- ated Kimbolton Castle, Castle Howard, and the Banque
de France. Marco Ricci makes a more striking figure, since he killed a
critic and himself. In 1699, aged twenty-three, he stabbed to death a
gondolier who had slighted his paintings. He fled to Dalmatia, fell in
love with its landscapes, and caught them so skillfully with his colors
that Venice forgave him and hailed him as Tintoretto reborn. His uncle
Sebastiano Ricci took him to London, where they collaborated on the tomb
of the Duke of Devonshire. Like so many artists of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, he loved to paint real or imaginary ruins, not
forgetting himself. In 1729, after several attempts, he succeeded in
committing suicide. In 1733 one of his paintings was sold for 00; in
1963 it was resold for 0, 000, 51 illustrating both the apprecia- tion
of art and the depreciation of money.</p>
<p>Rosalba Carriera is more pleasant to contemplate. She began her
career by designing patterns for point de Venise lace; then (like the
young Renoir) she painted snuffboxes; then miniatures; finally she found
her forte in pastel. By 1709 she had won such fame that when Frederick
IV of Denmark came he chose her to paint for him pastel portraits of the
most beautiful or cele- brated ladies of Venice. In 1720 Pierre Crozat,
millionaire art collector, in- vited her to Paris. There she was
welcomed and feted as no other foreign artist since Bernini. Poets wrote
sonnets about her; Regent Philippe d’Or - leans visited her; Watteau
painted her, and she him; Louis XV sat for her; she was elected to the
Academie de Peinture, and offered, as her diploma piece, the Muse that
hangs in the Louvre. It was as if in her the soul of ro- coco had been
made flesh.</p>
<p>In 1730 she went to Vienna, where she made pastel portraits of
Charles VI, his Empress, and the Archduchess Maria Theresa. Back in
Venice, she so absorbed herself in her art that she forgot to marry. The
Accademia there has a roomful of her portraits, the Gemaldegalerie of
Dresden has 157, almost all characterized by pink faces, blue
backgrounds, rosy innocence, dimpled delicacy; even when she pictured
Horace Walpole 52 she made him look like a girl. She flattered every
sitter but herself; the self-portrait in Windsor Castle shows her in her
later years, white-haired, a bit somber, as if foreseeing that she would
soon be blind. For the last twelve of her eighty- two years she had to
live without the light and color that had been to her almost the essence
of life. She left her mark on the art of her time: La Tour may have
taken fire from her; Greuze remembered her idealization of young women;
her rosy tints — la vie en rose — passed down to Boucher and Renoir.
Giovanni Battista Piazzetta was a greater artist, superior to sentiment,

<p>Xdaining decoration, seeking not so much to please the public as to
conquer the difficulties, and honor the highest traditions, of his
metier. His fellow craftsmen recognized this, and though Tiepolo had led
in establishing (1750) the Venetian Accademia di Pittura e Scultura, it
was Piazzetta whom they chose as its first president. His Rebecca at the
Well 53 is worthy of Titian, and makes even less concession to
conventional conceptions of beauty; enough of Rebecca is revealed to
stir the savage breast, but her Dutch face and snub nose were not
fashioned for Italian ecstasies. It is the man who moves us here, a
figure worthy of the Renaissance: a powerful face, an insinuating beard,
a feathered hat, a gleam of sly inducement in his eyes — and all the
picture a masterpiece of color, texture, and design. It was charac-
teristic of Piazzetta that he was the most respected of Venetian
painters in his day, and died the poorest.</p>
<p>Antonio Canale, called Canaletto, is more famous, for half the world
knows Venice through his vedute, or views, and England knew him in the
flesh. He followed for a while his father’s profession of scene painting
for theaters; in Rome he studied architecture; returning to Venice, he
applied compass and T square to his drawing, and made architecture a
feature of his pictures. F rom these we know the Queen of the Adriatic
as she looked in the first half of the eighteenth century. We note from
his Baccmo di San Marco 54 how crowded with vessels was the main lagoon;
we watch A Regatta on the Grand Canal 55 and see that life was as full
and eager then as it had ever been; and we are pleased to find the Ponte
di Rialto , 55 the Piazza San Marco , 57 the Piazzetta 53 the Palazzo
dei Dogi , 59 and Santa Maria della Salute 60 almost as we find them
today, except for the rebuilt Campanile. Such pictures were pre- cisely
what tourists needed in the cloudy north to remember gratefully the sun
and magic of Venezia la Serenissima. They bought and paid, and took
their mementos home, and soon England demanded Canaletto himself. He
came in 1746, and painted extensive views of Whitehall 61 and The Thames
from Richmond House; this last, astonishing in its combination of space,
per- spective, and detail, is Canaletto’s masterpiece. Not till 1755 did
he return to</p>
<p>As Canaletto showed the outer view of the splendid city, so Pietro
Longhi revealed the life within the walls by applying genre painting to
the middle class. The lady at breakfast en neglige, the abbe tutoring
her son, her little girl fondling a toy dog, the tailor coming to
display a frock, the dancing master putting the lady through the steps
of a minuet, the children wide- eyed at a menagerie, the young women
frolicking at blindman’s buff, the tradesmen in their shops, the maskers
at Carnival, the theaters, the coffee- houses, the literary coteries,
the poets reciting their verses, the quack doctors, the fortunetellers,
the vendors of sausages and plums, the promenade in the piazza, the
hunting party, the fishing party, the family on its villeggiatura</p>

<p>ITALIA FELI</p>

<p>holiday: all the mentionable activities of the bourgeoisie are there,
even more fully than in the comedies of Goldoni, Longhi’s friend. It is
not great art, but it is delightful, and shows a society more orderly
and refined than we should have imagined from the aristocrats of the
gambling casinos or the cursing stevedores of the wharves.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Tiepolo</li>
</ol>
<p>The Venetian who made Europe believe for a moment that the Renais-
sance had returned was Giambattista Tiepolo. Any summer’s day will see a
procession of students and tourists entering the Residenz of the Bishop
of Wurzburg to see the staircase and ceiling frescoed by Tiepolo in
1750-53; these are the peak of Italian painting in the eighteenth
century. Or look at The Trinity Appearing to St. Clement in the National
Gallery at London; observe its skillful composition, its precise
drawing, its subtle handling of light, its depth and glow of color;
surely this is Titian? Perhaps, if Tiepolo had not wandered so, he might
have joined the giants.</p>
<p>Or, possibly, he was handicapped by good fortune. He was the last
child of a prosperous Venetian merchant who, dying, left a substantial
patrimony. Handsome, bright, frolicsome, Gian “soon acquired an
aristocratic scorn of anything plebeian.” 63 In 1719, aged twenty
-three, he married Cecilia, sister of Francesco Guardi. She gave him
four daughters and five sons, of whom two became painters. They lived in
“a fine house” in the parish of Santa Trinita.</p>
<p>His talent had already bloomed. In 1716 he exhibited his Sacrifice of
Isaac , 64 crude but powerful; he was visibly at th is time under
Piazzetta’s influence. He studied Veronese too, and assumed a maniera
Paolesca of sumptuous raiment, warm colors, and sensuous lines. In 1726
the Archbishop of Udine invited him to adorn his cathedral and palace.
Tiepolo chose themes from the story of Abraham, but the treatment was
not quite Biblical: Sarah’s face, emerging from a Renaissance ruff, is a
corrugation of wrinkles revealing two vestigial teeth; the angel,
however, is an Italian athlete with an engaging leg. Tiepolo seems to
have felt that in a century that was beginning to laugh at angels and
miracles he could let his humor play with reverend traditions, and the
amiable archbishop indulged him. But the artist had to be careful, for
the Church was still one of the chief sources of pictorial commissions
in the Catholic world.</p>
<p>The other source was the layman with a palace to be adorned. In the
Palazzo Casali-Dugnani at Milan (1731) Gian told in frescoes the story
of Scipio. These were not typical Tiepolo, for he had not yet formed his
char- acteristic style of figures moving easily and loosely in undefined
space, but they showed a skill that made a stir in northern Italy. By 1
740 he found his forte, and achieved what some 65 have thought his chef-
d’oeuvre— the ceiling and banquet hall of the Palazzo Clerici in Milan.
Here he chose, as vehicles for his fancy, The Four Parts of the World ,
The Course of the Sun , and Apollo with the Pagan Gods. He was happy to
leave the somber world of</p>
<p>238 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XChristian legend and disport himself on Olympian heights where he
could use the Greco-Roman divinities as figures in a realm free from the
laws of mo- tion, the chains of gravity, and even the academic rules of
design. Like most artists, whose moral code melts in the heat of their
feelings, he was at heart a pagan; moreover, a fine body might be the
product of a resolute and forma- tive soul, and be therefore itself a
spiritual fact. For thirty years now Tiepolo would send gods and
goddesses — garbed in gauze and nonchalantly nude — frolicking through
space, chasing one another among the planets, or making love on a
cushion of clouds.</p>
<p>Back in Venice, he returned to Christianity, and his religious
pictures absolved his mythologies. For the Scuola di San Rocco he
painted a canvas, Hagar and lshmael, notable for the fine figure of a
sleeping boy. In the Church of the Gesuati — renamed by the Dominicans
Santa Maria del Rosario — he pictured The Institution of the Rosary. For
the Scuola dei Carmini, or School of the Carmelite Monks, he depicted
The Madonna of Mount Car- mel; this almost rivaled Titian’s
Annunciation. For the Church of St. Alvise he made three pictures; one
of these, Christ Carrying the Cross, is crowded with powerful figures
vividly portrayed. Tiepolo had paid his debt to his native faith.</p>
<p>His fancy moved more freely on palace walls. In the Palazzo Barbaro
he showed The Apotheosis of Francesco Barbaro — now in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York. For the Palace of the Doges he portrayed
Neptune Offering to Venus the Riches of the Sea. To the Palazzo Papa-
dopoli he contributed two delightful snatches of Venice in Carnival —
The Minuet and The Charlatan. And (topping all his palace pictures in
Venice) he embellished the Palazzo Labia with frescoes telling the story
of Antony and Cleopatra in magnificent scenes brilliantly realized. A
fellow artist, Girolamo Mengozzi-Colonna, painted the architectural
backgrounds in a burst of Palladian splendor. On one wall the meeting of
the two rulers; on the opposite wall their banquet; on the ceiling a
wild array of flying figures representing Pegasus, time, beauty, and the
winds — these blown about by jolly puffing imps. In The Meeting
Cleopatra descends from her barge in dazzling raiment revealing twin
mounds calculated to lure a tired triumvir to fragrant rest. In the
still more effulgent Banquet she drops a pearl without price into her
wine; Antony is impressed by this careless wealth; and on a balcony
musicians strum their lyres to double the jeopardy and triple the
intoxication. This masterpiece, recalling and rivaling Veronese, was one
of the pictures that Reynolds copied in 1752.</p>
<p>Such work in the grand style raised Tiepolo to a height visible
across the Alps. Count Francesco Algarotti, friend of Frederick and
Voltaire, spread his name through Europe. As early as 1736 the Swedish
minister in Venice informed his government that Tiepolo was just the man
to decorate the royal palace in Stockholm; “he is full of wit and zest,
easy to deal with, bub - bling over with ideas; he has a gift for
brilliant color, and works at a pro- digious speed; he paints a picture
in less time than it takes another artist to mix his colors.” 66
Stockholm was already beautiful, but it seemed so far away.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X2 39</p>
<p>In 1750 a closer invitation came: Karl Philipp von Greiffenklau,
Prince- Bishop of Wurzburg, asked him to paint the Imperial Hall of his
newly built Residenz , or administrative palace. The proffered fee moved
the aging mas- ter. Arriving in December with his sons Domenico,
twenty-four, and Lo- renzo, fourteen, he found an unexpected challenge
in the splendor of the Kaisersaal, which Balthasar Neumann had designed;
how could any picture catch the eye amid that radiance? Tiepolo’s
success here was the crown of his career. On the walls he depicted the
story of the Emperor Frederick Bar- barossa (who had kept tryst with
Beatrice of Burgundy at Wurzburg in</p>
<p>1156), and on the ceiling he showed Apollo Bringing the Bride; here
he reveled in an ecstasy of white horses, gay gods, and the play of
light upon prancing cherubs and filmy clouds. On a slope of the ceiling
he represented The Wedding: handsome faces, stately figures, flowered
drapery, garments recalling Veronese’s Venice rather than medieval
styles. The Bishop was so pleased that he enlarged the contract to
include the ceiling of the grand staircase, and two altarpieces for his
cathedral. Over the majestic stairway Tiepolo pictured the continents,
and Olympus — the happy hunting ground of his fancy — and a lordly
figure of Apollo the Sun God circling the sky.</p>
<p>Rich and weary, Giambattista returned to Venice (1753), leaving
Domen- ico to finish the assignment at Wurzburg. Soon he was elected
president of the Academy. He was of so amiable a disposition that even
his rivals were fond of him, and called him II Buon Tiepolo. He could
not resist all the demands made upon his waning time; we find him
painting in Venice, Tre- viso, Verona, Parma, and doing a large canvas
commissioned by “the court of Muscovy.” We should hardly have expected
another major work from him, but in 1757, aged sixty-one, he undertook
to decorate the Villa Val- marana near Vicenza. Mengozzi-Colonna drew
the architectural setting, Domenico signed some pictures in the guest
house, Giambattista deployed his brush in the villa itself. He chose
subjects from the Iliad , the Aeneid , the Orlando furioso , the
Gerusalemme liberata. He gave his airy illusionism full rein, losing
color in light, and space in infinity, letting his gods and goddesses
float at their ease in an empyrean raised above all care and time.
Goethe, marveling before these frescoes, exclaimed, u Gar frohlich und
brav ” (Very joyful and bold). It was Tiepolo’s last riot in Italy.</p>
<p>In 1761 Charles III of Spain asked him to come and paint in the new
royal palace at Madrid. The tired Titan pleaded age, but the King
appealed to the Venetian Senate to use its influence. Reluctantly, aged
sixty-six, he set out once more with his faithful sons and his model
Christina, again leaving his wife behind, for she loved the casinos of
Venice. We shall find him on a scaffold in Spain.</p>

<li>Goldoni and Gozzi</li>
</ol>
<p>Four figures, paired, stand out in the Venetian literature of this
age: Apos- tolo Zeno and Pietro Metastasio, both of whom wrote librettos
that were poetry; Carlo Goldoni and Carlo Gozzi, who fought over
Venetian comedy a comedy that became Goldoni’s tragedy. Of the first
pair Goldoni wrote:</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XThese two illustrious authors effected the reform of Italian opera.
Before them nothing but gods, devils, machines, and wonders were to be
found in these harmonious entertainments. Zeno was the first who
conceived the possi- bility of representing tragedy in lyrical verse
without degradation, and singing it without producing exhaustion. He
executed the project in a manner most satisfactory to the public,
reflecting the greatest glory on himself and his nation. 67</p>
<p>Zeno carried his reforms to Vienna in 1718, retired amiably in favor
of Metastasio in 1730, and returned to Venice and twenty years of peace.
Metastasio, as Goldoni noted, played Racine to Zeno’s Corneille, adding
re - finement to power, and bringing operatic poetry to an unprecedented
height. Voltaire ranked him with the greatest French poets, and Rousseau
thought him the only contemporary poet who reached the heart. His real
name was Pietro Trapassi — Peter Cross. A dramatic critic, Gian Vincenzo
Gravina, heard him singing in the streets, adopted him, rechristened him
Metastasio (Greek for Trapassi), financed his education, and, dying,
left him a fortune. Pietro ran through the fortune with poetic license,
then articled himself to a lawyer who exacted the condition that he
should not read or write a line of verse. So he wrote under a
pseudonym.</p>
<p>At Naples he was asked by the Austrian envoy to provide lyrics for a
cantata. Porpora composed the music; Marianna Bulgarelli, then famous
under the name of La Romanina, sang the lead; all went well. The diva
in- vited the poet to her salon; there he met Leo, Vinci, Pergolesi,
Farinelli, Hasse, Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti; Adetastasio
developed rapidly in that exciting company. La Romanina, thirty-five,
fell in love with him, twenty-three. She rescued him from the toil of
the law, took him into a menage a trois with her complaisant husband,
and inspired him to write his most famous libretto, Didone abbajidonata
, which twelve successive com- posers set to music between 1724 and
1823. In 1726 he wrote Siroe for his inamorata; Vinci, Hasse, and Handel
independently made operas of it. Metastasio was now the most
sought-after librettist in Europe.</p>
<p>In 1730 he accepted a call to Vienna, leaving La Romanina behind. She
tried to follow him; fearing that her presence would compromise him, he
secured an order forbidding her to enter Imperial territory. She stabbed
her breast in an attempt at suicide; this effort to play Dido failed,
but she lived only four years more. When she died she left to her
unfaithful Aeneas all her fortune. Stricken with remorse, Aletastasio
renounced the legacy in favor of her husband. “I have no longer any hope
that I shall succeed in con - soling myself,” he wrote, “an d I believe
that the rest of my life will be savor- less and sorrowful.” 67a He
sadly enjoyed triumph after triumph till the War of the Austrian
Succession interrupted operatic performances in Vienna. After 1750 he
repeated himself aimlessly. He had exhausted life thirty years before
his death (1782).</p>
<p>Opera, as Voltaire had predicted, drove the tragic drama from the
Italian stage, and left it to comedy. But Italian comedy was dominated
by the com-</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X2 4 I</p>
<p>media delY arte — the play of improvised speech and characterizing
masks. Most of the characters had long since become stereotyped:
Pantalone, the good-humored, trousered bourgeois; Tartaglia, the
stammering Neapolitan knave; Brighella, the simpleton schemer caught in
his own intrigues; Truffal- dino, the genial, carnal bon vivant ;
Arlecchino — our Harlequin; Pulcinello — our Punch; diverse towns and
times added several more. Most of the dia- logue, and many incidents in
the plot, were left to extempore invention. In “those improvised
comedies,” according to Casanova, “if the actor stops short for a word,
the pit and the gallery hiss him mercilessly.” 68</p>
<p>There were usually seven theaters operating in Venice, all named
after saints, and housing scandalously behaved audiences. The nobles in
the boxes were not particular about what they dropped upon the commoners
below. Hostile factions countered applause with whistling, yawns,
sneezes, coughs, cockcrows, or the meowing of cats. 69 In Paris the
theater audience was mostly composed of the upper classes, professional
men, and literati; in Ven- ice it was chiefly middle-class, sprinkled
with gaudy courtesans, ribald gon- doliers, priests and monks in
disguise, haughty senators in robe and wig. It was hard for a play to
please all elements in such an olla-podrida of human- ity; so Italian
comedy tended to be a mixture of satire, slapstick, buffoonery, and
puns. The training of the actors to portray stock characters made them
incapable of variety and subtlety. This was the audience, this the
stage, that Goldoni strove to raise to legitimate and civilized
comedy.</p>
<p>Pleasant is the simple beginning of his Memoirs:</p>
<p>I was born at Venice in 1707…. My mother brought me into the world
with little pain, and this increased her love for me. My first
appearance was not, as is usual, announced by cries; and this gentleness
seemed then an indica- tion of the pacific character which from that dav
forward 1 have ever pre- served. 70</p>
<p>It was a boast, but true; Goldoni is one of the most lovable men in
literary history; and despite this exordium his virtues included modesty
— a quality uncongenial to scribes. We may believe him when he says, “I
was the idol of the house.” The father went off to Rome to study
medicine, and then to Perugia to practice it; the mother was left at
Venice to bring up three children.</p>
<p>Carlo was precocious; at four he could read and write; at eight he
com- posed a comedy. The father persuaded the mother to let Carlo come
and live with him in Perugia. There the boy studied with the Jesuits,
did well, and was invited to join the order; he declined. The mother and
another son joined the father, but the cold mountain air of Perugia
disagreed with her, and the family moved to Rimini, then to Chioggia.
Carlo went to a Domini- can college in Rimini, where he received daily
doses of St. Thomas Aquinas’ Suvmta theologiae. Finding no drama in that
masterpiece of rationalization, he read Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus,
and Terence; and when a com- pany of actors came to Rimini he joined it
long enough to surprise his par- ents in Chioggia. They scolded him,
embraced him, and sent him to study law at Pavia. In 1731 he received
his degree, and began to practice. He mar-</p>

<p>Xried, and “was now the happiest man in the world,” 71 except that he
came</p>
<p>Gravitating back to Venice, he succeeded in law, and became consul
there for Genoa. But the theater continued to fascinate him; he itched
to write, and to be produced. His Belisarius was staged on November 24,
1734, with inspiring success; it ran every day till December 14, and his
old mother’s pride in him doubled his joy. Venice, however, had no taste
for tragedy; his further offerings in that genre failed, and he sadly
took to comedy. Never- theless he refused to write farces for the
commedia delF arte; he wanted to compose comedies of manners and ideas
in the tradition of Moliere, to put upon the stage no stock characters
frozen into masks, but personalities and situations drawn from
contemporary life. He chose some actors from a corn- media troupe in
Venice, trained them, and produced in 1740 his Momolo cortesan ( Momolo
the Courtier). “The piece was wonderfully successful, and I was
satisfied.” 72 Not quite, for he had compromised by leaving all the
dialogue unwritten except for the leading part, and by providing roles
for four of the traditional masked characters.</p>
<p>He advanced his reforms step by step. In La down a di gar bo ( The
Woman of Honor) he for the first time wrote out action and dialogue
completely. Hostile companies rose to compete with his, or to mock his
plays; the classes that he had satirized, like the cicisbei, plotted
against him; he fought them all with success after success. But no other
author could be found to furnish his troupe with suitable comedies; his
own, too often repeated, forfeited favor; he was compelled, by the
competition, to write sixteen plays in one year. He was at his peak in
1752, hailed by Voltaire as the Moliere of Italy. La locandera ( The
Mistress o f the Inn) had in that year “a success so brilliant that it
was… preferred to everything else that had yet been done in that kind of
comedy.” He prided himself on having observed the “Aristotelian unities”
of action, place, and time; otherwise he j udged his plays
realistically: “Good,” he said, “but not yet Moliere.” 73 He had written
them too rapidly to make them works of art; they were cleverly
constructed, pleasantly gay, and generally true to life, but they lacked
Moliere’s reach of ideas, fo rce of speech, power of presentation; they
remained on the surface of character and events. The nature of the
audience forbade him to try the heights of sentiment, philosophy, or
style; and he was by nature too cheerful to plumb the depths that had
tortured Moliere.</p>
<p>Once at least he was shocked out of his genial humor and touched to
the quick: when Carlo Gozzi challenged him for theatrical supremacy in
Ven- ice, and won.</p>
<p>There were two Gozzi involved in the literary turmoil at this time.
Gas- paro Gozzi wrote plays that were chiefly adaptations from the
French; he edited two prominent periodicals, and began the revival of
Dante. Not so genial was his brother Carlo: tall, handsome, vain, and
ever ready for a fight. He was the wittiest member of the Accademia
Granelleschi, which cam- paigned for the use of pure Tuscan Italian in
literature, rather than the Vene- tian idiom which Goldoni used in most
of his plays. As the lover or cavaliere</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X2 43</p>
<p>servente of Teodora Ricci, he may have felt the sting when Goldoni
satirized the cicisbei. He too wrote Memoirs — the white paper of his
wars. He judged Goldoni as one author sees another:</p>
<p>I recognized in Goldoni an abundance of comic motives, truth, and
natural- ness. Yet I detected poverty and meanness of intrigue;… virtues
and vices ill-adjusted, vice too often triumphant; plebeian phrases of
low double mean- ing;… scraps and tags of erudition stolen Heaven knows
where, and brought to impose upon a crowd of ignoramuses. Finally, as a
writer of Italian (except in the Venetian dialect, of which he showed
himself a master) he seemed not unworthy to be placed among the dullest,
basest, and least correct authors who have used our language…. At the
same time I must add that he never produced a play without some
excellent comic trait. In my eyes he had always the appearance of a man
who was born with a natural sense of how sterling comedies should be
composed, but who — by defect of education, by want of discernment, by
the necessity of satisfying the public and supplying new wares to the
poor comedians through whom he gained his livelihood, and by the hurry
in which he produced so many pieces every year to keep himself afloat —
was never able to fabricate a single play which does not swarm with
faults. 74</p>
<p>In 1757 Gozzi produced a volume of verses expressing kindred
criticisms in “the style of good old Tuscan masters.” Goldoni replied in
terza rima (Dante’s medium) to the eff ect that Gozzi was like a dog
baying at the moon — u come il cane che abbaja la luna” Gozzi retorted
by defending the corn - media deW arte from Goldoni’s strictures; he
charged that Goldoni’s plays were “a hundred times more lascivious,
indecent, and harmful to morals” than the comedy of masks; and he
compiled a vocabulary of “obscure ex - pressions, dirty double-
entendres ,… and other nastinesses” from Gol - doni’s works. The
controversy, Molmenti tells us, “threw the city into a kind of frenzy;
the case was discussed in playhouses, homes, shops, coffee- houses, and
streets.” 75</p>
<p>Abate Chiari, another dramatist stung by Gozzi’s Tuscan asp,
challenged him to write a better play than those he had condemned. Gozzi
answered that he could do this easily, on even the most trivial themes,
and by using only the traditional comedy of masks. In January, 1761, a
company at the Teatro San Samuele produced his Fiaba delV amore delle
tre melarancie ( Fable of the Love of the Three Oranges) — merely a
scenario that showed Pantalone, Tartaglia, and other “masks” seeking
three oranges believed to have magic powers; the dialogue was left to be
improvised. The success of this “fable” was decisive: the Venetian
public, living on laughter, relished the imagina tion of the tale and
the implied satire of Chiari’s and Goldoni’s plots. Gozzi followed with
nine other fiabe in five years; but in these he supplied a poetic
dialogue, thereby in part admitting Goldoni’s criticism of the commedia
delV arte. In any case , Gozzi’s victory seemed complete. The attendance
at the San Samuele remained high, that at Goldoni’s Teatro Sant’ Angelo
fell toward bankruptcy. Chiari moved to Brescia, and Goldoni ac- cepted
an invitation to Paris.*</p>
<p>Two of Gozzi’s “fables” were made into operas: Re Turcindote by
Weber, Busoni, and Puccini, The Love of the Three Oranges by
Prokofiev.</p>
<p>244 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XAs his farewell to Venice Goldoni produced (1762) Una delle ultime
sere di Carnevale ( One of the Last Evenings of Carnival ). It told of a
textile de- signer, Sior Anzoleto, who with a heavy heart was leaving in
Venice the weavers whose looms he had so long provided with patterns.
The audience soon saw in this an allegory for the dramatist regretfully
leaving the actors whose stage he had so long supplied with plays. When
Anzoleto appeared in the final scene, the theater (Goldoni tells us)
“rang with thunderous ap - plause, amid which could be heard,… ‘A happy
journey!’ ‘Come back to us!’ ‘Don’t fail to come back to us!’” 76 He
left Venice on April 15, 1762, and never saw it again.</p>
<p>In Paris he was engaged for two years in writing comedies for the
Theatre des Italiens. In 1763 he was sued for seduction, 77 but a year
later he was engaged to teach Italian to the daughters of Louis XV. For
the wedding of Marie Antoinette and the future Louis XVI he composed in
French one of his best plays, Le Bonrru bienfaisant ( The Be?ievolent
Boor). He was re- warded with a pension of twelve hundred francs, which
was annulled by the Revolution when he was eighty-one years old. He
solaced his poverty by dictating to his wife his Memoirs (1792) —
inaccurate, imaginative, illuminat- ing, entertaining; Gibbon thought
them ’’more truly dramatic than his Italian comedies.” 78 He died on
February 6, 1793. On February 7 the Na - tional Convention, on a motion
by the poet Marie- Joseph de Chenier, restored his pension. Finding him
in no condition to receive it, the Convention gave it, reduced, to his
widow.</p>
<p>Gozzi’s victory in Venice was brief. Long before his death (1806)
his</p>
<p>Fiabe had passed from the stage, and Goldoni’s comedies had been
revived in the theaters of Italy. They are still played there, almost as
frequently as Moliere’s in France. His statue stands on the Campo San
Bartolommeo in Venice, and on the Largo Goldoni in Florence. For, as his
Memoirs said, “humanity is everywhere the same, jealousy displays itself
everywhere, and everywhere a man of a cool and tranquil disposition in
the end acquires the love of the public, and wears out his enemies.”

<li>ROME</li>
</ol>
<p>South of the Po, along the Adriatic and spanning the Apennines, were
the states of the Church — Ferrara, Bologna, Forli, Ravenna, Perugia,
Benevento, Rome — forming the central and largest part of the /Magic
Boot.</p>
<p>When Ferrara was incorporated into the Papal States (1598) its
Estense dukes made Modena their home, and gathered there their archives,
books, and art. In 1700 Lodovico Muratori, priest, scholar, and doctor
of laws, be- came curator of these treasures. From them in fifteen years
of labor and twenty-eight volumes, he compiled Rerum italic arum
scriptores ( Writers of Italian Affairs, 1723-38) ; later he added ten
volumes of Italian antiquities and inscriptions. He was rather an
antiquarian than an historian, and his twelve- volume Annali d’ Italia
was soon superseded; but his researches in documents</p>
<p>CHAP. IX ) ITALIA FELIX 245</p>
<p>and inscriptions made him the father and source of modern historical
writing in Italy.</p>
<p>Aside from Rome the most flourishing of these states was Bologna. Its
renowned school of painting continued under Giuseppe Crespi (“Lo Spag -
nuolo” ). Its university was still one of the best in Europe. The
Palazzo Bevi- lacqua (1749) was among the most elegant structures of the
century. A remarkable family, centering in Bologna, brought theatrical
architecture and scene painting to their highest excellence in modern
times. Ferdinando Galli da Bibiena built the Teatro Reale at Mantua
(1731), wrote famous texts on his art, and begot three sons who carried
on his skill in deceptive and sump- tuous ornament. His brother
Francesco designed theaters in Vienna, Nancy, and Rome, and Verona’s
Teatro Filarmonico— often rated the finest in Italy. Ferdinando’s son
Alessandro became chief architect for the Elector of the Palatinate.
Another son, Giuseppe, designed the interior of the opera house at
Bayreuth (1748) — “the most beautiful of its kind in existence.” 80 A
third son, Antonio, drew the plans for the Teatro Communale at
Bologna.</p>
<p>That theater, and the massive old Church of San Petronio, heard the
best instrumental music in Italy, for Bologna was the chief Italian
center of musi- cal education and theory. There Padre Giovanni Battista
Martini held his modest but austere court as the most respected music
teacher in Europe. He had a music library of seventeen thousand volumes;
he composed classic texts on counterpoint and musical history; he
corresponded with a hundred celeb- rities in a dozen lands. The accolade
of the Accademia Filarmonica, of which he was for many years the head,
was coveted by all musicians. Here the boy Mozart would come in 1770 to
face the prescribed tests; here Rossini and Donizetti were to teach. The
annual festival of new compositions, performed by the hundred-piece
orchestra of the Accademia, was, for Italy, the su- preme event of the
musical year.</p>
<p>Gibbon estimated the population of Rome in 1740 at some 156,000
souls. Recalling the brilliance of the Imperial past, and forgetting its
paupers and slaves, he found the charm of the Catholic capital
uncongenial to his taste:</p>
<p>Within the spacious enclosures of the [Aurelian] walls the largest
portion of the seven hills is overspread with vineyards and ruins. The
beauty and splendor of the modern city may be ascribed to the abuses of
the government, and to the influence of superstition. Each reign (the
exceptions are rare) has been marked by the rapid elevation of a new
family, enriched by the childless pontiff at the expense of the Church
and country. The palaces of these fortunate nephews are the most costly
monuments of elegance and servitude: the perfect arts of architecture,
painting, and sculpture have been prostituted in their serv- ice; and
their galleries and gardens are decorated with the most precious works
of antiquity which taste or vanity has prompted them to collect. 81</p>
<p>The popes of this period were distinguished by their high morality;
their morals rose as their power fell. They were all Italians, for none
of the Cath- olic monarchs would allow any of the others to capture the
papacy. Clem- ent XI (r. 1700-21) justified his name by reforming the
prisons of Rome. Innocent XIII (172 1-24), in the judgment of the
Protestant Ranke,</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xpossessed admirable qualifications for the spiritual as well as the
temporal gov- ernment, but his health was extremely delicate…. The Roman
families con- nected with him, and which had hoped to be promoted by
him, found them- selves completely deceived; even his nephew could not
obtain without difficulty the enjoyment of those twelve thousand ducats
annually, which had now be- come the usual income of a nephew. 82</p>
<p>Benedict XIII (1724- 30) was “a man of great personal piety,” 83 but
(says a Catholic historian) he “allowed far too much power to unworthy
favo r- ites.” 84 Clement XII (1730 -40) flooded Rome with his
Florentine friends, and, when old and blind, allowed himself to be ruled
by his nephews, whose intolerance further embittered the conflict
between Jesuits and Jansenists in France.</p>
<p>Macaulay thought Benedict XIV (1740- 58) “the best and wisest of the
250 successors of St. Peter.” 85 A sweeping judgment, but Protestants,
Cath - olics, and unbelievers join in acclaiming Benedict as a man of
wide learning, lovable character, and moral integrity. As archbishop of
Bologna he had seen no contradiction between attendance at the opera
three times a week and strict attention to his episcopal tasks; 86 and
as a pope he reconciled the purity of his personal life with gaiety of
humor, freedom of speech, and an almost pagan appreciation of literature
and art. He added a nude Venus to his collection, and told Cardinal de
Tencin how the Prince and Princess of Wiirttemberg scratched their names
on a gracefully rounded portion of the anatomy not often mentioned in
papal correspondence. 87 His wit was almost as keen as Voltaire’s, but
it did not prevent him from being a careful administrator and a
far-seeing diplomat.</p>
<p>He found papal finances in chaos: half the revenue was lost in
transit, and a third of Rome’s population consisted of ecclesiastics far
more numerous than the business of the Church required, and more
expensive than the Church could properly afford. Benedict reduced his
own staff, dismissed most of the papal troops, ended papal nepotism,
lowered taxes, introduced agricultural improvements, and encouraged
industrial enterprise. Soon his probity, economies, and efficiency
brought a surplus to the papal treasury. His foreign policy made genial
concessions to turbulent kings: he signed with Sardinia, Portugal,
Naples, and Spain concordats allowing their Catholic rulers to nominate
to episcopal sees. He strove to quiet the doctrinal furor in France by a
lax enforcement of the anti- Jansenist bull Unigenitus; “since
infidelity progresses daily,” he wrote, “we must rather ask whether men
believe in God than whether they accept the bull.” 88</p>
<p>He made brave efforts to find a modus vivendi with the Enlightenment.
We have noted his cordial acceptance of the dedication o f Voltaire’s Ma
- homet, though this play was under ecclesiastical fire in Paris (1746).
He ap- pointed a commission to revise the Breviary and to eliminate some
of the more incredible legends; however, the recommendations of this
commission were not carried out. He secured by his personal activity the
election of d’Alembert to the Bologna Institute. 89 He discouraged the
hasty prohibition of books. When some aides advised him to denounce La
Mettrie’s UHomme</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X2 47</p>
<p>mac hine he replied, “Should you not refrain from reporting to me the
audacities of fools?” And he added, “Know /that the pope has a free hand
only to give blessings.” 90 The revised Index Expurgatorius which he
issued in 1758 abandoned all attempts to keep track of non-Catholic
literature; with a few exceptions it confined itself to prohibiting some
books by Catholic authors. No condemnation should be made until the
author, if available, had been given a chance to defend himself; no book
on a learned subject should be condemned except after consultation with
experts; men of science or scholarship should be readily given
permission to read prohibited books. 91 These rules were followed in
subsequent editions of the Index, and were confirmed by Leo XIII in 1
900.</p>
<p>The popes found it almost as difficult to govern Rome as to rule the
Cath- olic world. The populace of the city was probably the roughest and
most violent in Italy, perhaps in Europe. Any cause could lead to a duel
in the nobility, or to a bloody conflict between the sectionally
patriotic gangs that divided the Holy City. At the theater the judgment
of the audience could be merciless, especially when wrong; we shall see
an instance with Pergolesi. The Church strove to appease the people with
festivals, processions, indul- gences, and Carnival. During the eight
days preceding Lent they were al- lowed to don gay and fanciful
disguises, and frolic on the Corso; nobles sought popular favor by
parades of horses or chariots bearing skilled riders or Beautiful women,
all richly adorned; prostitutes offered their wares at temporarily
raised rates; and masked flirtations relieved for some hours the strain
of monogamy. Carnival over, Rome resumed its uneven tenor of piety and
crime.</p>
<p>Art did not prosper amid the diminishing returns of a declining
faith. Architecture made some minor contributions: Alessandro Galilei
gave the old Church of San Giovanni in Laterano a proud fagade,
Ferdinando Fuga put a new face upon Santa Maria Maggiore, and Francesco
de Sanctis raised the stately, spacious Scala di Spagna from the Piazza
di Spagna to the shrine of Santissima Trinita dei Monti. Sculpture added
a famous monument, the Fontana di Trevi — where the pleased tourist
throws a coin over his shoulder into the water to ensure a further visit
to Rome. This “Fountain of the Three Outlets” had a long history.
Bernini may have left a sketch for it; Clement XII opened a competition
for it; Edme Bouchardon of Paris and Lambert- Sigisbert Adam of Nancy
submitted plans; Giovanni Maini was chosen to design it; Pietro Bracci
carved the central group of Neptune and his team (1732); Filippo della
Valle molded the figures of Fertility and Healing; Niccolo Salvi
provided the architectural background; Giuseppe Pannini completed the
work in 1762; this collaboration of many minds and hands through thirty
years may suggest some faltering of will or failure of funds, but it
bars any thought that art in Rome was dead. Bracci added to his honors
the tomb (now in St. Peter’s) of Alaria Clementina Sobieska, the unhappy
wife of the Stuart Pretender James III; and della Valle left in the
Church of St. Ignatius a delicately carved relief of the Annunciation,
worthy of the High Renaissance.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XPainting produced no marvels at Rome in this age, but Giovanni
Battista Piranesi made engraving a major art. Born to a stonemason near
Venice, he read Palladio and dreamed of palaces and shrines. Venice had
more artists than money, Rome had more money than artists; so Giovanni
moved to Rome, and set up as architect. But buildings were not in
demand. He de- signed them anyway; or, rather, he drew imaginary
structures that he knew no one would build, including fantastic jails
that looked as if the Spanish Steps had fallen upon the Baths of
Diocletian. He published these drawings in 1750 as Opere varie di
architettura and Car cert (Prisons), and people bought them as they
bought puzzles or mysteries. In loftier mood Piranesi turned his skill
to engraving his sketches of ancient monuments. He fell in love with
them, as Poussin and Robert did; he mourned to see these classic ruins
disintegrating further, day by day, through spoliation or neglect; for
twenty-five years, almost daily, he went out to draw them, sometimes
miss- ing meals; even when he was dying of cancer he continued to draw,
engrave, and etch. His Roman Antiquities and Views of Rome went out as
prints over Europe, and shared in the architectural revival of classic
styles.</p>
<p>That revival was powerfully stimulated by excavations at Herculaneum
and Pompeii — towns that had been overwhelmed by the eruption of
Vesuvius in a.d. 79. In 1719 some peasants reported that they had found
statues em- bedded in the earth at Herculaneum. Nineteen years passed
before funds could be secured for systematic exploration of the site. In
1748 similar ex- cavations began to reveal the wonders of pagan Pompeii,
and in 1752 the massive and majestic Greek temples of Paestum were
cleared from the jungle. Archaeologists came from a dozen countries to
study and describe the find- ings; their drawings stirred the interest
of artists as well as historians; soon Rome and Naples were invaded by
enthusiasts for classic art, especially from Germany. Mengs came in
1740, Winckelmann in 1755. Lessing longed to go to Rome, “to remain
there at least for a year, and, if possible, forever.” 92 And Goethe —
but let that story wait.</p>
<p>Anton Raphael Mengs is hard to place, for he was born in Bohemia
(1728), worked chiefly in Italy and Spain, and chose Rome for his home.
His father, a painter of miniatures at Dresden, named him after
Correggio and Raphael, and pledged him to art. The boy showed talent,
and the father took him, aged twelve, to Rome. There, we are told, he
shut him up in the Vatican day after day, with bread and wine for lunch,
and told him, for the rest, to feed on the relics of Raphael,
Michelangelo, and the classic world. After a brief stay in Dresden Anton
returned to Rome, and won attention by a painting of the Holy Family.
For this he took as his model Margarita Guazzi, “a poor, virtuous, and
beautiful maiden.” 93 He married h er in 1749, and in the same embrace
he accepted the Roman Catholic faith. Again in Dresden, he was appointed
court painter to Augustus III at a thousand thalers a year. He agreed to
paint two pictures for a Dresden church, but he persuaded the
Elector-King to let him do these in Rome, and in 1752, aged twenty-four,
he settled there. At twenty-six he was made director of the Vatican
School of Painting. In 1755 he met Winckelmann, and agreed with him that
baroque</p>

<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X2 49</p>
<p>was a mistake, and that art must chasten itself with neoclassic
forms. Prob- ably about this time he executed in pastel the
self-portrait now in the Dres- den Gemaldegalerie — the face and hair of
a girl, but eyes flashing with the pride of a man sure that he could
shake the world.</p>
<p>When Frederick the Great chased Augustus from Saxony ( 1756), Mengs’s
royal salary stopped, and he had to live on the modest fees offered him
in Italy. He tried Naples, but the local artists, following an old
Neapolitan custom, threatened his life as an alien invader, and Mengs
hurried back to Rome. He adorned the Villa Albani with once famous
frescoes; still visible there is his Parnassus (1761), technically
excellent, coldly classical, emotion- ally dead. Nevertheless the
Spanish minister at Rome felt that this was the man to decorate the
royal palace in Madrid. Charles III sent for Mengs, promised him two
thousand doubloons per year, plus a house and a coach, and free passage
on a Spanish man-of-war soon to sail from Naples. In Sep- tember, 1761,
Mengs arrived in Madrid.</p>

<li>NAPLES</li>
</ol>
<p>/. The King and the People</p>
<p>The kingdom of Naples, comprising all Italy south of the Papal
States, was buffeted about in the struggle for power among Austria,
Spain, England, and France. But that is the dreary logic-chopping of
history, the bloody seesaw of victory and defeat; let us merely note
that Austria took Naples in 1707; that Don Carlos, Bourbon duke of Parma
and son of Philip V of Spain, drove out the Austrians in 1734, and, as
Charles IV, king of Naples and Sicily, ruled till 1759. His capital,
with 300,000 population, was the largest city in Italy.</p>
<p>Charles matured slowly into the royal art. At first he took kingship
as a license for luxury: he neglected government, spent half his days in
hunting, and ate himself into obesity. Then, toward 1755, inspired by
his Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs, Marchese Bernardo di
Tanucci, he undertook to mitigate the harsh feudalism that underlay the
toil and ecstasy of Neapolitan life.</p>
<p>Three interlocking groups had long ruled the kingdom. Nobles owned
almost two thirds of the land, held four fifths of its five million
souls in bond - age, dominated the parliament, controlled taxation, and
frustrated all reform. The clergy owned a third of the land, and held
the people in spiritual subjection with a theology of terror, a
literature of legends, a ritual of stupe- faction, and such miracles as
the semiannual manipulated liquefaction of the congealed blood of
St. Januarius, Naples’ patron saint. Administration was in the hands of
lawyers beholden to nobles or prelates, and therefore pledged to the
medieval status quo. A small middle class, mostly of merchants, was
politically impotent. Peasants and proletaires lived in a poverty that
drove some into brigandage and many into beggary; there were thirty
thousand</p>
<p>2 5 °</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xbeggars in Naples alone. 94 De Brosses called the masses of the
capital “the most abominable riffraff, the most disgusting vermin” 95 —
a judgment that con- demned the result without stigmatizing the cause.
We must admit, however, that those ragged, superstitious, and
priest-ridden Neapolitans seemed to have more of the salt and joy of
life in them than any other populace in Europe.</p>
<p>Charles checked the power of the nobles by attracting them to the
court to be under the royal eye, and by creating new nobles pledged to
his support. He discouraged the flow of youth into monasteries, reduced
the ecclesiastical multitude from 100,000 to 81,000, laid a tax of two
per cent upon church property, and limited the legal immunities of the
clergy. Tannuci restricted the jurisdiction of the nobles, fought
judicial corruption, reformed legal procedure, and moderated the
severity of the penal code. Freedom of wor- ship was allowed to the
Jews, but the monks assured Charles that his lack of a male heir was
God’s punishment for this sinful toleration, and the indul- gence was
withdrawn. 98</p>
<p>The King’s passion for building gave Naples two famous structures.
The vast Teatro San Carlo was raised in 1737; it is still one of the
largest and most beautiful opera houses in existence. In 1752 Luigi
Vanvitelli began at Caserta, twenty-one miles northeast of the capital,
the enormous royal palace that was designed to rival Versailles, and to
serve the similar functions of hous - ing the royal family, the
attendant nobility, and the main administrative staff. Slaves black or
white toiled on the task for twenty-two years. Curved buildings flanked
a spacious approach to the central edifice, which spread its front for
830 feet. Within were a chapel, a theater, countless rooms, and a broad
double stairway of which every step was a single marble slab. Behind the
palace, for half a mile, lay formal gardens, a population of statues,
and ma- jestic fountains supplied by an aqueduct twenty-seven miles
long.</p>
<p>Other than this Caserta (for the palace, like the Escorial and
Versailles, took the name of its town) there was no outstanding art in
the Naples of this age, nor anything meijiorable in drama or poetry. One
man wrote a bold lstoria civile del regno di Napoli (1723), a running
attack upon the greed of the clergy, the abuses of the ecclesiastical
courts, the temporal power of the Church, and the claim of the papacy to
hold Naples as a papal fief; its author, Pietro Giannone, was
excommunicated by the Archbishop of Na- ples, fled to Vienna, was thrown
into prison by the King of Sardinia, and died in Turin (1748) after
twelve years of confinement. 97 — Antonio Geno- vesi, a priest, lost his
faith while reading Locke, and in Elementa metaphys- icae (1743) tried
to introduce the Lockian psychology into Italy. In 1754 a Florentine
businessman established in the University of Naples the first European
chair of political economy on two conditions: that it should never be
held by an ecclesiastic, and that its first occupant should be Antonio
Geno- vesi. Genovesi repaid him (1756) with the first systematic
economic treatise in Italian, Lezioni di commercio, which voiced the cry
of merchants and manufacturers for liberation from feudal,
ecclesiastical, and other restraints on free enterprise. In that same
year Quesnay raised the same demand for the French middle class in his
articles for Diderot’s Encyclopedic.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX ) ITALIA FELIX 251</p>
<p>Perhaps some liaison had been established between Genovesi and
Quesnay by Ferdinando Galiani, of Naples and Paris. Galiani published in
1750 a Trattato della moneta, in which, with the innocence of a
twenty-two-year- old economist, he determined the price of a product by
the cost of its pro- duction. More brilliant was his Dialoghi sul
commercio dei grant, which we have noted as a criticism of Quesnay. When
he had to come home after his exciting years in Paris, he mourned that
Naples had no salons, no Mme. Geoffrin to feed him and stir his wit. It
had, however, a philosopher who left a mark on history.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Giambattista Vico</li>
</ol>
<p>At the age of seven, says his autobiography, he fell from a ladder,
struck the ground head first, and remained unconscious for five hours.
He suffered a cranial fracture over which a massive tumor formed. This
was reduced by successive lancings; however, the boy lost so much blood
in the process that the surgeons expected his early death. “By God’s
grace” he survived, “but as a result of this mischance I grew up with a
melancholy and irritable tem- perament.” 98 He also developed
tuberculosis. If genius depends upon some physical handicap Vico was
richly endowed.</p>
<p>At seventeen (1685) he earned his bread by tutoring at Vatolla (near
Salerno) the nephews of the bishop of Ischia. There he remained nine
years, meanwhile feverishly studying jurisprudence, philology, history,
and phi- losophy. He read with special fascination Plato, Epicurus,
Lucretius, Ma- chiavelli, Francis Bacon, Descartes, and Grotius, with
some injury to his catechism. In 1697 he obtained a professorship in
rhetoric at the University of Naples; it paid him only a hundred ducats
yearly, to which he added by tutoring; on this he raised a large family.
One daughter died in youth; one son showed such vicious tendencies that
he had to be sent to a house of correction. The wife was illiterate and
incompetent; Vico had to be father, mother, and teacher. 99 Amid these
distractions he wrote his philosophy of history.</p>
<p>Principi di una scienza nuova d’intorno alia commune natura delle
nazioni (1725) offered the “principles of a new science concerning the
common nature of the nations,” and proposed to find in the jungle of
history regulari- ties of sequence that might illuminate past, present,
and future. Vico thought that he could discern three main periods in the
history of every people:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The age of the gods, in which the Gentiles believed that they lived
under divine governments, and that everything was commanded them by
[gods through] auspices and oracles…. (2) The age of heroes, when these
reigned in aristocratic commonwealths, on account of a certain
superiority of nature which they held themselves to have over the plebs.
(3) The age of men, in which all recognized themselves as equal in human
nature, and there- fore established the first popular commonwealths, and
then monarchies. 100</li>
</ol>
<p>Vico applied the first period only to “Gentiles” and “profane” (non
-</p>
<p>Biblical) history; he could not, without offending sacred tradition,
speak of</p>
<p>2 5 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xhe Old Testament Jews as merely believing that they “lived under
divine governments.” Since the Inquisition (severer in Naples than in
northern Italy) had prosecuted Neapolitan scholars for talking of men
before Adam, Vico laboriously reconciled his formula with Genesis by
supposing that all the descendants of Adam, except the Jews, had
relapsed, after the Flood, into an almost bestial condition, living in
caves, and copulating indiscriminately in a communism of women. It was
from this secondary “state of nature” that civilization had developed
through the family, agriculture, property, moral- ity, and religion. At
times Vico spoke of religion as a primitive animistic way of explaining
objects and events; at times he exalted it as a peak of evolution. To
the three stages of social development correspond three “natures,” or
ways of interpreting the world: the theological, the legendary, the
rational.</p>
<p>The first nature, by an illusion of imagination (which is strongest
in those who are weakest in reasoning power), was a poetic or creative
nature, which we may be allowed to call divine, since it conceived
physical things as ani- mated by gods…. Through the same error of their
imagination men had a terrible fear of the gods whom they themselves had
created…. The second nature was the heroic: the heroes believed
themselves to be of divine origin…. The third was the human nature
[way], intelligent and therefore modest, benign, and rational,
recognizing conscience, reason, and duty as laws. 101</p>
<p>Vico strove to fit the history of language, literature, law, and
government into this triadic scheme. In the first stage men communicated
through signs and gestures; in the second, through “emblems,
similitudes, images”; in the third, through “words agreed upon by the
people,… whereby they might fix the meaning of the laws.” Law itself
passed through a corresponding development: at first it was divine,
god-given, as in the Mosaic code; then heroic, as in Lycurgus; then
human — “dictated by fully developed human reason.” 102 Government, t
oo, has gone through three stages: the theocratic, in which the rulers
claimed to be the voice of God; the aristocratic, in which “all civil
rights” were confined to the ruling order of “heroes”; and the hu - man,
wherein “all are accounted equal before the laws…. This is the case in
the free popular cities, and… also in those monarchies that make all
their subjects equal under their laws.” 103 Vico evidently recalled
Plato’s summary of political evolution from monarchy through aristocracy
to de- mocracy to dictatorship ( tyrannis ), but he varied the formula
to read: theocracy, aristocracy, democracy, monarchy. He agreed with
Plato that democracy tends toward chaos, and he looked upon one-man rule
as a neces- sary remedy for democratic d isorder; “monarchies are the
final governments… in which nations come to rest.” 104</p>
<p>Social disorder may come through moral deterioration, luxury,
effeminacy, loss of martial qualities, corruption in office, a
disruptive concentration of wealth, or an aggressive envy among the
poor. Usually such disorder leads to dictatorship, as when the rule of
Augustus cured the democratic chaos of the Roman Republic. 105 If even
dictatorship fails to stem decay, some more vigorous nation enters as
conqueror.</p>
<p>Since people so far corrupted have already become slaves of their
unre- strained passions,… Providence decrees that they become slaves by
the</p>
<p>chap, ix)</p>
<p>ITALIA FELI</p>
<p>X253</p>
<p>natural law of nations;… they become subject to better nations which,
having conquered them, keep them as subject provinces. Herein two great
lights of natural order shine forth: first, that he who cannot govern
himself must let himself be governed by another who can; second, that
the world is always governed by those who are naturally fittest. 106</p>
<p>In such cases the conquered people falls back into the stage of
development reached by its conquerors. So the population of the Roman
Empire, after the barbarian invasions, relapsed into barbarism, and had
to begin with the- ocracy [rule by priests and theology]; such were the
Dark Ages. With the Crusades came another heroic age; the feudal
chieftains correspond to the heroes of Homer, and Dante is Homer
again.</p>
<p>We hear in Vico echoes of the theory that history is a circular
repetition, and of Machiavelli’s law of cor si e ricorsi, development
and return. The idea of progress suffers in this analysis; progress is
merely one half of a cyclical movement in which the other half is decay;
history, like life, is evolution and dissolution in an ineluctible
sequence and fatality.</p>
<p>On his way Vico offered some striking suggestions. He reduced many
heroes of classic legend to eponyms — afternames — post-factum
personifica- tions of long impersonal or multipersonal processes; so
Orpheus was the imaginary consolidation of many primitive musicians;
Lycurgus was the embodiment of the series of laws and customs that
congealed Sparta; Romu- lus was a thousand men who had made Rome a
state. 107 Likewise Vico re- duced Homer to a myth by arguing — half a
century before Friedrich Wolf’s Prolegomena to Homer (1795) — that the
Homeric epics are the accumulated and gradually amalgamated product of
groups and generations of rhapsodes who sang, in the cities of Greece,
the sagas of Troy and Odysseus. 108 And almost a century before Barthold
Niebuhr’s History of Rome (1811 -32) Vico rejected as legendary the
first chapters of Livy. “All the histories of the Gentil e nations have
had fabulous beginnings.” 109 (Again Vico carefully avoids impugning the
historicity of Genesis. )</p>
<p>This epochal book reveals a powerful but harassed mind struggling to
formulate basic ideas without getting himself into an Inquisition jail.
Vico went out of his way, time after time, to profess his loyalty to the
Church, and he felt that he merited ecclesiastical commendation for
explaining the principles of jurisprudence in a manner compatible with
Catholic theology. 110 We hear a sincerer tone in his view of religion
as the indispensable support of social order and personal morality:
“Religions alone have the power to cause the people to do virtuous
works…” U1 And yet, despite his frequent use of “Providence,” he seems
to eliminate God from history, and to reduce</p>
<p>Perhaps the emerging secularism of Vico’s analysis had something to
do with its failure to win a hearing in Italy, and doubtless the
disorderly dis- cursiveness of his work and the confusion of his thought
doomed his “new science” to a still but painful birth. No one agreed
with his belief that he had written a profound or illuminating book. He
appealed in vain to Jean Le Clerc to at least mention it in the
periodical Nouvelles de la republique</p>
<p>254 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xdes lettres. Ten years after the Scienza nuova appeared, Charles IV
came to Vico’s aid by appointing him historiographer royal with a yearly
stipend of a hundred ducats. In 1741 Giambattista had the satisfaction
of seeing his son Gennaro succeed to his professorship in the University
of Naples. In his final years (1743-44) his mind gave way, and he lapsed
into a mysticism border- ing on insanity.</p>
<p>A copy of his book was in Montesquieu’s library. 112 In private notes
the French philosopher acknowledged his debt to Vico’s theory of
cyclical de - velopment and decay; and that debt, unnamed, appears in
Montesquieu’s Greatness and Decadence of the Rowans ( 1 7 34). For the
rest Vico remained almost unknown in France until Jules Michelet
published (1827) an abridged translation of the Scienza nuova. Michelet
described Italy as “the second mother and nurse who in my youth suckled
me on Virgil, and in my ma- turity nourished me with Vico.” 113 In 1826
Auguste Comte began the lec- tures that became his Corns de philosophie
positive (1830-42), wherein the influence of Vico is felt at every
stage. It was left for a Neapolitan, Benedetto Croce, to give Vico his
full due, 114 and to suggest again that history must take its place
beside science as the ground and vestibule of philosophy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Neapolitan Music</li>
</ol>
<p>Naples reversed Pythagoras, and judged music to be the highest
philoso- phy. Said Lalande, the French astronomer, after a tour of Italy
in 1765-66:</p>
<p>Music is the special triumph of the Neapolitans. It seems as if in
that country the membranes of the eardrum are more taut, more
harmonious, more sonorous than elsewhere in Europe. The whole nation
sings. Gestures, tone, voice, rhythm of syllables, the very conversation
— all breathe music…. So Naples is the principal source of Italian
music, of great composers and excellent operas; it is there that
Corelli, Vinci, Rinaldo, Jommelli, Durante, Leo, Pergolesi,… and so many
other famous composers have brought forth their masterpieces. 115</p>
<p>Naples, however; was supreme only in opera and vocal melody; in
instru- mental music Venice led the way; and music fanciers complained
that the Neapolitans loved the tricks of the voice more than the
subtleties of harmony and counterpoint. Here reigned Niccolo Porpora,
“perhaps the greatest sing - ing teacher who ever lived.” 116 Every
Italian warbler aspired to be his pupil, and, once accepted, bore humbly
with his imperious eccentricities; so, said a story, he kept Gaetano
Caffarelli for five years at one page of exercises, and then dismissed
him with the assurance that he was now the greatest singer in Europe.
117 Second only to Porpora as a teacher was Francesco Durante, who
taught Vinci, Jommelli, Pergolesi, Paisiello, and Piccini.</p>
<p>Leonardo Vinci seemed handicapped by his name, but he won early ac-
claim by his setting of Metastasio’s Dido? le abba??donata; Algarotti
felt that</p>

<p>and buffa, oratorio, Masses, and motets; Naples oscillated for some
time be- tween laughing at his comic opera La finta Fracastana and
weeping over the “Miserere” that he composed for the Lenten services of
1744.</p>
<p>When, about 1735, Leo heard a cantata by Niccolo Jommelli, he ex-</p>
<p>claimed, “A short time, and this young man will be the wonder and
admira - tion of Europe.” 119 Jommelli almost verified the prophecy. At
twenty -three he won the plaudits of Naples with his first opera; at
twenty-six he earned a similar triumph in Rome. Passing to Bologna, he
presented himself as a pupil to Padre Martini; but when that reverend
teacher heard him extem- porize a fugue in all its classic development
he cried out, “Who are you, then? Are you making fun of me? It is I who
should learn from you.” 120 At Venice his operas aroused such enthusiasm
that the Council of Ten appointed him music director of the Scuola degli
Incurabili; there he wrote some of the best religious music of that
generation. Moving on to Vienna (1748) he composed in close friendship
with Metastasio. After further victories in Venice and Rome he settled
down in Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg (1753-68) as Kapellmeister to the Duke
of Wiirttemberg. Here he modified his operatic style in a German
direction, giving more complexity to his harmony, more substance and
weight to the instrumental music; he discarded the da capo repetition of
arias, and provided orchestral accompaniment for recitatives. Probably
under the influence of Jean-Georges Noverre, the French ballet master at
Stuttgart, he gave ballet a prominent part in his operas. In some
measure these developments in Jommelli’s music prepared the way for the
reforms of Gluck.</p>
<p>When the aging composer returned to Naples (1768) the audience re-
sented his Teutonic tendencies, and decisively rejected his operas.
Mozart, hearing one of them there in 1770, remarked: “It is beautiful,
but the style is too elevated, as well as too antique, for the theater.”
121 Jommelli fared better with his church music; his “Miserere” and his
Mass for the Dead were</p>
<p>Naples laughed even more than it sang. It was with a comic opera that
Pergolesi conquered Paris after that proud city, alone among the
European capitals, had refused to submit to Italy’s opera seria.
Giovanni Battista Pergo - lesi did not fight that battle in person, for
he died in 1736 at the age of twenty-six. Born near Ancona, lie came to
Naples at sixteen. By the age of twenty-two he had written several
operas, thirty sonatas, and two Masses much admired. In 1733 he
presented an opera, 11 prigioniero, and as an inter- lude to this he
offered La serva padrona — “the maid” become “mistress” of the house.
The libretto is a jolly story of how Serpina, the servant, maneu- vers
her master into marrying her; the music is an hour of gaiety and agile
arias. We have seen how this artful frolic captured the mood and heart

<p>XParis in the Guerre des Bouffons of 1752, when it ran for a hundred
per- formances at the Opera, and then, in 1753, for ninety-six more at
the Theatre-Fran§ais. Meanwhile Pergolesi conducted his opera VOlimpiade
in Rome ( 1 7 35 ). It was hailed with a storm of hoots, and with an
orange accu- rately aimed at the composer’s head. 123 A year later he
went to Pozzuoli to be treated for tuberculosis, which had been made
worse by his profligate life. His early death atoned for his sins, and
he was buried in the local cathedral by the Capuchin friars among whom
he had spent his last days. Rome, re- pentant, revived VOlimpiade, and
applauded it rapturously. Italy honors him not so much for his joyous
intermezzi as for the tender sentiment of his “Stabat Mater,” which he
did not live to complete. Pergolesi himself was made the subject of two
operas.</p>
<p>Domenico Scarlatti, like Pergolesi, has been slightly inflated by the
winds of taste, but who can resist the sparkle of his prestidigitation?
Born in the annus mirabilis of Handel and Bach (1685), he was the sixth
child of Ales- sandro Scarlatti, then the Verdi of Italian opera. He
breathed music from his birth. His brother Pietro, his cousin Giuseppe,
his uncles Francesco and Tommaso, were musicians; Giuseppe’s operas were
produced in Naples, Rome, Turin, Venice, Vienna. Fearing lest Domenico’s
genius be stifled by this plethora of talent, the father sent him, aged
twenty, to Venice. “This son of mine,” he said, “is an eagle whose wings
are grown. He must not remain in the nest, and I must not hinder his
flight.” 124</p>
<p>In Venice the youth continued his studies, and met Handel. Perhaps
to- gether they passed to Rome, where, at the urging of Cardinal
Ottoboni, they engaged in an amiable competition on the harpsichord and
then on the organ. Domenico was already the best harpsichordist in
Italy, but Handel, we are told, equaled him; while on the organ
Scarlatti frankly owned il caro Sas- sone’s superiority. The two men
became fast friends; this is extremely diffi - cult for leading
practitioners of the same art, but, a contemporary tells us, “Domenico
had the sweetest temper and the genteelest behavior,” 125 and Handel’s
heart was as big as his frame. The shy modesty of the Italian de -
terred him from giving public displays of his harpsichord mastery; we
know it only from reports of private musicales. One auditor in Rome
(1714) “thought ten thousand devils had been at the instrument”; never
before had he heard “such passages of execution and effect.” 126
Scarlatti was the first to develop the keyboard potentialities of the
left hand, including its crossing over the right. “Nature,” he said,
“gave me ten fingers, and as my instrument has employment for all, I see
no reason why I should not use them.” 127</p>
<p>In 1709 he accepted appointment as maestro di capella to the former
Queen of Poland, Maria Kazimiera. On the death of her husband, Jan So-
bieski, she had been banished as a troublesome intriguer; coming to Rome
in 1 699, she resolved to set up a salon as brilliant with genius as
that of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had died ten years before. In a
palace on the Piazza della Trin ita dei Monti she gathered many of
Christina’s former circle, including several members of the Arcadian
Academy. There (1709-14) Scarlatti produced several of his operas.
Encouraged by their success, be</p>

<p>Xpresented Amleto ( Hamlet ) in the Teatro Capranico. It was not well
re- ceived, and Domenico never again offered an opera to an Italian
public. His father had set a standard too high for him to reach.</p>
<p>For four years (17 15-19) he directed the Cappella Giulia at the
Vatican, and officiated at the organ in St. Peter’s; now he composed a
“Stabat Mater”</p>
<p>Scarlatti’s wife died in 1739, leaving him five children. He married
again, and soon the five were nine. When Maria Barbara became queen of
Spain (1746) she brought the Scarlatti family with her to Madrid.
Farinelli was the favorite musician of the royal pair, but the singer
and the virtuoso became good friends. Scarlatti’s position was that of a
privileged servitor, providing music for the Spanish court. He obtained
leave to go to Dublin in 1740 and to London in 1741; but mostly he lived
in quiet content in or near Madrid, almost secluded from the world, and
probably with no suspicion that he would become a favorite with pianists
in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Of the 555 “sonatas” that now precariously support his fame on t heir
tonal filigree, Scarlatti in his lifetime published only thirty. Their
modest title, Esercizii per gravicembalo , indicated their limited aim —
to explore the possi- bilities of expression through harpsichord
technique. They are sonatas only in the older sense of the term, as
instrumental pieces to be “sounded,” not sung. Some have contrasted
themes, and some are paired in major and minor keys, but they are all in
single movements, with no attempt at thematic elabo- ration and
recapitulation. They represent the emancipation of harpsichord music
from the influence of the organ, and the reception, by keyboard com-
positions, of influences from opera. The vivacity, delicacy, trills, and
tricks of sopranos and castrati are here surpassed by agile fingers
obeying a playful and prodigal imagination. Scarlatti literally “played”
the harpsichord. “Do not expect,” he said, “any profound learning, but
rather an ingenious jesting with art.” 129 Something of the Spanish
dance— its prancing feet and swirling skirts and tinkling castanets — is
in these ripples and cascades, and everywhere</p>
<p>That joy in the instrument must have been one source of solace to
Scar- latti in those serving years in Spain. It was rivaled by his
delight in gambling, which consumed much of his pension; the Queen had
