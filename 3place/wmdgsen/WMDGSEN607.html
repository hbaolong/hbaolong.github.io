<h4 id="chapter-xii-napoleon-and-the-arts">CHAPTER XII Napoleon and the
Arts</h4>
<p>I. MUSIC</p>
<p>H AVING a continent to manage, Napoleon could not spare much time for
music. It is hard to picture him sitting still and mute through one of
the concerts at the Theatre-Feydeau; nevertheless we hear of concerts
given in the Tuileries, and we are assured that he took some pleasure in
the intimate recitals arranged by Josephine in her apartments. 1 In any
case Sebas- tien £rard and Ignaz Pleyel were making fine pianos, and
every home in le beau monde had one. Many a hostess arranged a private
musicale, at which, said the Goncourts, her guests listened heroically,
2 preferring spirited conversation. The Germans feasted on music without
words; the French lived on words without music.</p>
<p>Napoleon liked opera better than concerts; he had little ear or voice
for song, but it was part of the royal decor that the ruler should
attend the opera occasionally, to meditate and be seen. He regretted
that “Paris lacked… an opera house worthy of its high claims” as the
capital of civilization; 3 it had to wait for his nephew and Charles
Gamier to raise (1861-75) the sparkling gem that crowns the Avenue de
l’Opera. Even so, h undreds of operas were composed and produced during
his rule, ha Dame blanche of Frangois- Adrien Boieldieu, master of comic
opera, received a thousand per- formances in forty years. 4 Napoleon’s
Italian nature favored Italian operas, with their melodious arias and
dramatic plots. Enthusiastic over Giovanni Paisiello’s compositions, he
invited him to come and direct the Paris Opera and the Conservatory of
Music. Paisiello came (1802), aged sixty-five; but the only opera he
composed in Paris, Proserpina (1803), suffered a luke- warm reception;
he withdrew into Masses and motets, and in 1804 he re- turned to Italy,
where he served a more congenial audience in the Naples of Joseph
Bonaparte and Joachim Murat.</p>
<p>Napoleon was more fortunate with Gasparo Spontini, who came in 1803,
and earned the Emperor’s support by treating historical subjects in such
wise as to shed glory on the new Empire. His most famous opera, La V es-
tate, had difficulty in finding a company to stage it; Josephine
interceded; it was produced; its “bizarre” and “noisy” theatrical
emphasis combined with its love story to make it one of the most
enduring successes in operatic record. When Napoleon was overthrown,
Spontini composed music to cele- brate the Bourbon Restoration.</p>
<p>Cherubini, who had dominated Parisian opera during the Revolution,
con- tinued to dominate it under Napoleon; however, the Emperor
preferred lighthearted ariatic music to Cherubini’s more stately
presentations, and left</p>
<p>278</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) NAPOLEON AND THE ARTS 279</p>
<p>him noticeably unrewarded. The composer accepted an invitation to
Vienna (July, 1 805 ) , but Napoleon captured that city in November.
Cherubini was not quite pleased when he was called upon to conduct music
for the soirees given by Napoleon in the Palace of Schonbrunn. He
returned to France, and found hospitality in the chateau of the Prince
de Chimay, who had made Mme. Tallien respectable with marriage. On
returning from Elba, Napo- leon, amid all his distractions, took time to
make Cherubini a chevalier of the Legion of Honor; but it was only under
Louis XVIII that the somber Italian received due recognition and a
comfortable income. From 1821 to 1841, as director of the Paris
Conservatory of Music, he influenced an entire generation of French
composers. He died in 1842, aged eighty-two, almost forgotten in the
careless kaleidoscope of time.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>VARIA</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon closely rivaled Louis XIV in patronage of art, for, like
him, he wished to proclaim the glory and grandeur of France, and he
hoped that the artists would keep him fresh in human memory. His own
taste was not of the best, as became one bred and bound to soldiering,
but he did what he could to provide the artists of France with historic
originals and personal stimulus. He pilfered masterpieces not only as
negotiable wealth (as they are bought today), and as trophies and
testimonials of victories, but as models for students in the museums of
France; so the Venus de’ Medici came from the Vatican, Correggio’s
lissome saints from Parma, Vermeer’s Marriage of Cana from Venice,
Rubens’ Descent from the Cross from Antwerp, Muril - lo’s Assumption of
the Virgin from Madrid… ; even the bronze horses of St. Mark’s made
their perilous way to Paris. Altogether, between 1796 and 1814, Napoleon
sent 506 works of art from Italy to France; of these, 249 were returned
after his fall, 248 remained, 9 were lost. 6 Through such pillage Paris
replaced Rome as the art capital of the Western world. As conquests
multiplied, the spoils overflowed into the provinces; and to receive
them Napoleon created museums in Nancy, Lille, Toulouse, Nantes, Rouen,
Ly- ons, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Geneva, Brussels,
Montpellier, Greno- ble, Amiens… Over all these collections, and
particularly over the Louvre, Napoleon appointed Dominique Denon, who
had served him in many lands, and who never forgot that the Emperor
himself had gone to drag him to safety from a plateau swept by enemy
fire during the battle of Eylau.</p>
<p>Napoleon established competitions and substantial prizes in several
fields of art. He renewed the Prix de Rome, and restored the French
Academy at Rome. He invited artists to his table, and played art critic,
even during cam- paigns. He valued most those painters who could most
effectively com- memorate his deeds, and those architects who could help
him make Paris the most beautiful of cities, and his reign the apex of
its history. He commis- sioned sculptors to adorn fifteen new fountains
for its squares.</p>
<p>Just as his taste in painting ran to the classical, so in
architecture he ad-</p>
<p>28 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>mired the monumental style of ancient Rome, and aimed at strength and
sublimity rather than at grace of relief or charm of detail. So he
commissioned Barthelemy Vignon to design a Temple of Glory in honor of
the Grande Armee; he bade its builders use nothing but marble, iron, and
gold in its con- struction. The task proved so costly and difficult
that, begun in 1 809, it re- mained unfinished when Napoleon fell. His
successors completed it (1842) as a church dedicated to Saint Mary
Magdalen — La Madeleine. France has never taken to it; neither the piety
nor the gaiety of Paris accords with that forbidding fagade, whose
columns might better -express an advancing army than a tender sinner so
penitent of her favors and so lavish in her love. — Monumental too is
the Palais de la Bourse, or Stock Exchange, which’ Alex- andre-Theodore
Brongniart began in 1808, and which Etienne de La Barre continued in
1813; never elsewhere has Mammon been so majestically housed.</p>
<p>The preferred architects of the reign were Charles Percier and his
usual associate, Pierre-F ran^ois-Leonard Fontaine. Together they
labored to unite the Louvre with the Tuileries, despite the unevenness
in their structural lines; so they built the north wing (Cour Carree) of
the Louvre (1806). They re- paired and renovated the exterior, and
connected the floors with massive stairways. They designed the Arc de
Triomphe du Carrousel (1806-08) in the style and proportions of the Arch
of Septimius Severus in Rome. The more stately A rc de Triomphe de
l’Etoile, at the farther end of the Champs - Elysees, was begun (1806)
by Jean-Frangois Chalgrin, but had merely emerged from its foundations
when Napoleon fell; it was not completed till 1837, three years before
his ashes passed under it in their triumphant proces- sion to his tomb
in the Hotel des Invalides. Frankly imitating the Arch of Constantine in
Rome, it surpassed it — and any Roman arch — in beauty, partly because
of its marble bas-reliefs. At the left Jean-Pierre Cortot carved The
Crowning of Napoleon; at the right Francois Rude, in The Marseillais ( 1
83 3 — 36) , caught the martial ecstasy of the Revolution. This is one
of the high moments of nineteenth-century sculpture.</p>
<p>That difficult art, under Napoleon, rested on the laurels it had
earned be- fore his rise. Houdon survived till 1828, and made a bust of
him (now in the Museum of Dijon) which earned the artist a place in the
Legion of Honor. Still remembering Roman emperors — this time the
sculptured record of Tra- jan’s victories— Napoleon commissioned
Jean-Baptiste Le Pere and Jacques Gondouin to tell the story of the
Austerlitz campaign in bronze reliefs to be attached, plaque by plaque,
in an ascending spiral on a column that would dominate the Place
Vendome. It was so done (1806-10), and in 1808 An- toine Chaudet crowned
the shaft with a statue of Napoleon made from’ cannon captured from the
enemy. Seldom had victorious pride mounted so</p>

<p>The minor arts — cabinetry, interior decoration, tapestry,

<p>ished under Napoleon; Sevres again produced fine porcelain. Furniture
took on the solid, sturdy “Empire style.” The miniatures in which Isabey
por - trayed, with microscopic brilliance, the leading characters of the
age are among the finest of their kind in history. Joseph Chinard made
delectable terra-cotta busts of Josephine and Mme. Recamier; the latter
is especially fine, with one breast bared as a sample and as befitted a
woman who was re- solved to remain half a virgin to the end.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE PAINTERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Pailiting prospered now, for the country was prospering, and patrons
could pay. Napoleon paid well, for he was playing to a gallery of
centuries, and hoped to prolong their attention by the blandishments of
literature and art. His admiration of Augustus ’ Rome and Louis XIV’s
Paris inclined him to favor classic norms of art — line, order, logic,
proportion, design, reason, restraint; but the keenness of his senses,
the range of his imagination, and the force of his passions gave him
some understanding of the Romantic move- ment that was rising to
liberate individualism, feeling, originality, imagina- tion, mystery,
and color from the bondage of tradition, conformity, and rule. So he
made classic David his court painter, but he kept a corner of his fa vor
for the sentiment ,of Gerard, the idyls of Prud’hon, and the explosive
colors of Gros.</p>
<p>Jacques-Louis David took naturally to a patron who called himself a
con- sul, who for a time tolerated, a tribunate of popular orators, and
who dis- guised his decrees as senatus consulta. He visited the
triumphant Corsican soon after the 18th Brumaire. Napoleon won him at
once by greeting him as the French Apelles, but gently reproved him for
spending so much talent on ancient history; were there not memorable
events in modern — even in contemporary — history? “However,” he added,
“do what you please; your pencil will confer celebrity upon any subject
you may select. For every his- torical picture you may choose to paint
you shall receive 100,000 francs.” 6 This was convincing. David sealed
the pact with Bonaparte Crossing the Alps (1801), which showed a
handsome warrior with a charming leg, on a magnificent horse that
appears to be galloping up a rocky mountainside- one of the most
brilliant pictures of the age.</p>
<p>David had voted for the execution of Louis XVI; he must have winced
when Napoleon made himself emperor and restored all the pomp and power
of monarchy. But he went to see his new master crowned; the fascination
of that scene overcame his politics; and after three years of
intermittent de- votion, he commemorated the event in the pictorial
masterpiece of the period. Almost a hundred Characters were portrayed in
The Coronation of Napoleon (1807), even Madame Mere Letizia, who was not
there; most of them faithfully, except for Cardinal Caprara, who
complained that David had revealed him bald, without his usual wig.
Everyone else was pleased. Napo-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>leon, after examining the picture for half an hour, raised his hat to
the artist, saying, “Cest bien , tres bien. David, je vous salue.” 7</p>
<p>David was not merely the official court painter; he was the
unchallenged leader of French art in his time. Everyone of account came
to him to sit for a portrait — Napoleon, Pius VII, Murat, even Cardinal
Caprara, bewigged. 8 His pupils — especially Gerard, Gros, Isabey,
Ingres — spread his influence even while deviating from his style. As
late as 1814 English visitors to the Louvre were surprised to find young
artists copying not the Renaissance masters, but the pictures of David.
9 A year later he was banished by the restored Bourbons. He went to
Brussels, where he prospered with portraits. He died in 1825, having
lived fully in all his seventy-seven years.</p>
<p>Of his pupils we leave Ingres (1770-1867) to later years; we bow in
pass- ing to Gerard and Guerin for their illuminating portraits; we stay
longer with Antoine- Jean Gros because of his interesting passage
through the styles. We have watched him at Milan, painting, or
imagining, Napoleon on the Bridge at Arcole; here, so soon, classic
David’s heir is flirting with romance. Napoleon rewarded Gros’s idolatry
with a military commission that enabled the young artist to see war at
close view. Like Goya a few years later, he saw not so much the fighting
as the suffering. In The Plague at Jaffa (1804) he showed Napoleon
touching the sores of a victim, but also he showed the terror and
hopelessness of men, women, and children stricken by an obscene and
undiscriminating fate. In The Battle of Eylau (1808) he pictured not the
battle but the field stricken with the dying and the dead. He felt the
living warmth of Rubens’ colors, and poured into his paintings a flesh
-and-blood vitality that raised the Romantic spirit of post-Napoleonic
France. Then, feeling that he had betrayed his banished master, he tried
to recapture in his work the calm of the classic style. He failed, and —
lost and forgotten in an age wild with Hugo, Berlioz, Gericault and
Delacroix — he succumbed to a melancholy that dried up in him the sap
and love of life. On June 25, 1835, aged sixty-four, he left his home,
walked out toward Meudon, and drowned himself in a tributary of the
Seine.</p>
<p>Pierre- Paul Prud’hon (1758 -1823) advanced the Romantic surge by
pre- ferring ideal beauty to reality, goddesses to gods, and Correggio
to Raphael. He recognized with David the primacy of line, but felt that
without color line was dead. He was feminine except in his love of
women; his meditative tenderness and amorous sensitivity could forgive
all faults that came in a gracious form. As youngest of thirteen
children he was harassed with pov- erty in Cluny, and developed
hesitantly; however, the local monks saw him drawing and painting, and
persuaded a bishop to finance Pierre’s art study in Dijon. He did well
there, but, aged twenty, he married a goddess who was soon transformed
into a rasping shrew. He won a scholarship, went to Rome without his
wife, courted Raphael, then Leonardo, and finally sur- rendered to
Correggio.</p>
<p>In 1789 he rejoined his wife, moved to Paris, and soon found himself
stranded in a revolutionary chaos that had no time or taste for his
Cupids</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>and Psyches; obstinately he continued to paint them — with a loving
delicacy that seemed to caress the flesh with the brush. He ate by
producing bill heads, miniatures, and commercial illustrations. After
ten years of such servi- tude he won from the Directory a commission to
paint a picture — Wisdom Descending to Earth — which caught the
attention of General Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Not till 1808, when he was fifty, did he win acclaim. In that year he
em- bodied his voluptuous dreams in The Rape of Psyche, and then
balanced it with Justice and Vengeance Pursuing Crime. Impressed,
Napoleon nomi- nated him to the Legion of Honor, and gave him an
apartment in the Sor- bonne. In the next apartment the love-hungry
painter found another artist, Constance Mayer, who became his mistress,
housekeeper, and the solace of his old age. In 1821 Constance,
apparently distracted with religious qualms, killed herself. The shock
overwhelmed Prud’hon. In 1823 he died, almost unnoticed in the
excitement of that Romantic movement which he had for- warded by going
back from David to Watteau, and renewing the French worship of beauty
and grace.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon was well acquainted with the classic drama of France, and
only less so with the dramatic literature of ancient Greece. Corneille
was his favorite because in him, far more than in Racine, he found what
he felt was a just understanding of heroism and nobility. “A good
tragedy,” he said, at St. Helena, “gains upon us every day. The higher
kind of tragedy is the school of great men: it is the duty of sovereigns
to encourage and dissemi- nate a taste for it…. Had Corneille lived in
my time I would have made him a prince.” 10 The Emperor did not care for
comedy; h e had no need to be amused; Talleyrand pitied M. de Remusat
because, as director of enter- tainments at the imperial court, he was
expected to arrange some amuse- ments for u cet homme inatnusable.” 11
But this unamusable man lavished funds upon the Comedie- Frangaise and
its “stars”; he welcomed Talma to his table, and Mile. George to his
bed.</p>
<p>In 1807 Napoleon restricted the number of Paris theaters to nine, and
rein- stituted the Theatre-Fran9ais — the then and present home of the
Comedie- Fran§aise — in almost exclusive right to perform the classic
drama. On Oc- tober 15, 1812, amid the ruins of burned Moscow, he found
time to draw up for the Theatre-Francais an elaborate code of
regulations which still govern it today. 12 So encouraged, the
Comedie-Francaise staged, during the Empire, the finest productions of
classic drama in French history. To supplement these activities the
Theatre de l’Odeon, built in 1779 and destroyed by fire</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>in 1799, was rebuilt in 1808 on classic lines by Chalgrin. A court
theater was set up in the Tuileries, and private theatricals of
considerable excellence were staged in many rich homes.</p>
<p>Talma, after playing his parts in the Revolution, reached his
zenith</p>
<p>under Napoleon. His own character was so proud, distinctive, and
intense that he must have found difficulty in shedding it for any
assumed role. He mastered the subtle art by learning to control and
coordinate all the move- ments of his limbs, all the muscles and
features of his face, every inflection of his voice, to fit and convey
any sensation, feeling, or idea, any wonder, doubt, or intention, in the
personality he portrayed. Some playgoers went re- peatedly to see him in
the same role to relish and study the finesse of his art. He had
discarded the oratorical style of the theater in the Old Regime; he
spoke the alexandrine verses as if they were unmetered prose; he
rejected any unnatural expression or sentiment; yet he could be as
tender as any lover, as passionate as any criminal; Mme. de Stael, moved
almost to terror by Talma’s portrayal of Othello, 13 wrote to him, in
1807: “You are, in your career, unique in all the world, and no one,
before you, has reached that degree of perfection where art unites with
inspiration, reflection with spon- taneity, and reason with genius.”
14</p>
<p>Napoleon too was enamored of the tragedian. He gave him substantial
sums, paid his debts, and frequently invited him to breakfast; then the
Em- peror could so lose himself in discourse on the drama that he kept
diplomats and generals waiting while he explained historical details
that should deter- mine the presentation of a character. On the morning
after seeing La Mort de Fompee he told Talma, “I am not entirely
satisfied. You use your arms too much. Monarchs are less prodigal of
gestures; they know that a motion is an order, and that a look is death;
so they are sparing of motions and looks.” Talma, we are assured,
profited from this counse l. 15 In any case he remained to the end of
his life the ruler of the French stage.</p>
<p>It had its queens too, as Napoleon observed. Mile. Duchesnois was
plain of face but perfect in form. Accordingly, as Dumas pere reported,
“she was particularly fond of the part of Alzire, in which she could
display her form almost naked.” But also “she had a voice containing
