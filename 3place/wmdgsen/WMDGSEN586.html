<h4 id="chapter-xvi">CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<p>France Beneath the Wars</p>
<p>1559-1643</p>
<p>I. MORALS</p>
<p>T he religion whose varieties gave specious excuses for so many wars
was beginning to suffer from its political employment; there was a</p>
<p>growing number of men who questioned the divinity of doctrines that
argued by the competitive shedding of blood; and in the upper classes
doubts of the Christian ethic began to mingle with skepticism of the
creed. It was a sign of the times when a good priest, Pierre Charron,
ex- plained the respectability of sex and its absurd apparatus.^</p>
<p>The peasants retained their faith, and honored the Christian code
even when violating it; they might kill one another in passing ecstasy,
they might diverge from monogamy when opportunity called and
surveillance slept, but otherwise they led a tolerably decent life,
heard Mass regularly, and, at least once a year, consumed the body and
the blood of the Lord. The middle classes — Catholic or Huguenot — gave
the best example of Christian morality: they dressed modestly, married
once, attended to their business and their children, went to church, and
gave the state its priests, physicians, lawyers, magistrates, and
stability. Even in the aristocracy there were ex- emplary women; Charles
IX called his wife, Elizabeth of Austria, the most virtuous woman in the
world. But generally, in the leisure classes of the capital and in the
artisans of the towns, erotic matters were getting out of hand. It was
an age of frankly physical drive. Something of the platonic love that
had amused Bembo and Castiglione in Italy and Marguerite of Navarre in
France survived in the circle of Mme. de Rambouillet (herself an
Italian), but it was mostly a feminine device, a resistance in depth to
glorify the citadel.</p>
<p>So far as we know, Catherine de Medicis was a faithful wife and
solici- tous mother, but gossip accused her of training pretty women to
seduce her enemies into obedience,* and Jeanne d’Albrct (something of a
prude) de - scribed Catherine’s court as “the most corrupt and accursed
society that ever was.”® Brantome was a scandalmonger, but his testimony
sho uld enter the picture:</p>
<p>As for our fair women of France . . . they have in the last fifty
years</p>
<p>learned so much gentleness and delicacy, so much attraction and</p>
<p>393</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>charm in their clothes, in their fair looks and wanton ways . . .
that</p>
<p>now none can deny that they surpass all other women in every re-</p>
<p>spect. . . . Moreover, the wanton language of love is in France more
wanton, more exciting and sweeter-sounding, than in other tongues. And
more than all, this blessed liberty which we have in France . . .</p>
<p>renders our women more desirable and captivating, more tractable and
easy of access than all others; and further, adultery is not so
generally punished as in other lands … In a word, it is good to make
love in</p>
<p>France.^</p>
<p>The kings set the fashion. Francis II died too soon for sinning.
Charles IX had his Marie Toucher. Henry III passed from mignonettes to
mignons. Henry IV was faithfully heterosexual. Neither he nor his
mistress Gab- rielle d’Estrees seems to have objected to her being
portrayed naked to the</p>
<p>Even so, the complaisance of the women lagged behind the eagerness of
the men, and prostitutes labored to meet the swelling demand. Paris
recog- nized three types: the chevre coijfee (she-goat with a hairdo)
for the court, the petrel (chattering bird) for the bourgeoisie, and the
pierreuse, who served the poor and lived in a stone basement. There were
educated tarts for aristocrats, like Marion Delorme, who, dying,
confessed ten times, since after each shriving she reminded herself of
untold sins.’’ Charles IX and Henry III issued edicts outlawing
brothels, and an ordinance of Louis XIII (1635) required that all
detected prostitutes should be “ whipped, shaved, and banished,” and
that all men concerned in the traffic should be sent to the galleys for
life.® Several men, including Montaigne and a Huguenot clergyman,
protested against such measures, and advocated the legalization of
brothels in the interest of public morals.® These laws re- mained on the
statute books till the late eighteenth century, but were seldom
enforced. Other decress fought in vain against nature’s perversions and
vagaries; Montaigne tells of a girl who at twenty-two was changed into a
man.^® Obscene literature found a ready market, and print-shop windows
displayed erotic pictures without incurring any now known
interference.</p>
<p>Social and political morality suffered from the wars. The sale of
public offices was extended to a nearly universal venality. The
financial administra- tion, before Sully cleansed it, was corrupt to the
point of chaos.^* War was not as indiscriminately devastating as it Avas
soon to be under Louis XIV; yet we hear of armies. Huguenot as well as
Catholic, engaging in wholesale massacre, pillage, and rape, stringing
citizens up by the thumbs, or kindling a fire under their feet, to
extort hidden gold. Dueling became</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>more frequent in the sixteenth century, perhaps because the sword
became a regular part of male dress. It was forbidden by Charles IX,
under the urging of Michel de L’Hopital, but it became almost an
epidemic under Henry III; seconds as well as principals were expected to
fight; duels, said Montaigne, were now battles. Richelieu’s edict
against dueling differed from its predecessors in being vigorously and
impartially enforced. After his death the practice revived.</p>
<p>Crime was frequent. Nocturnal Paris was mostly unlit; robbery and</p>
<p>murder flourished; violent brawls disordered the streets, and travel
in the countryside endangered life as well as limb. Penalties were
barbarous; we are not sure that they were effective deterrents, but
probably crime would have been still worse without them. Imprisonment
was genteel for gentle- men; aristocrats sent to the Bastille could pay
for comfortable quarters equipped with their own furniture and wives.
Common criminals might be sent to stifling dungeons or be deported to
colonies or condemned to the galleys. Traces of this last penalty go
back to 1532, but its earhest known enactment in French law belongs to
1561. The galeriens were usually sen- tenced for ten years; the letters
gal were branded on their backs. In winter they remained in their docked
galleys or were herded into prisons, chiefly at Toulon or Marseille.
During the Religious Wars many captured Hugue- nots were sentenced to
the galleys, where they received such brutal treat- ment that death must
have seemed a boon. Epidemics of suicide broke out in those bitter
decades, above all among the women of Lyon and Marseille.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>manners</li>
</ol>
<p>Manners improved while morals declined. Catherine de Medicis had
brought Italian politeness with her, a sense of beauty, a taste for
elegance, a refinement in appointments and dress. Brantome thought her
court the finest that had ever been, “a veritable earthly Paradise,”
sparkling with “at least three hundred ladies and damo iselles”^*
dressed to the height of taxa - tion. French court ceremonial,
established by Francis I, now displaced the Italian as the model of
Europe. Henry III created the office of Grand</p>
<p>Master of the Ceremonies of France and issued an edict detailing the
ritual and protocol of court behavior, specifying the persons who were
to be admitted to the king’s presence, the manner of addressing him, of
serving him at his rising, his toilette, his meals, and his retiring,
who might accom- . pany him on his walks or hunts, who might attend the
court balls. Henry III, timid and finicky, insisted on these rules;
Henry IV violated them freely, Louis XIII ignored them, Louis XIV
expanded them into a liturgy rivaling High Mass.</p>
<p>396 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Court dress became increasingly costly and ornate. Marshal de Bas-
sompierre wore a coat made of cloth of gold, laden with pearls weighing
fifty pounds and costing fourteen thousand ecus.^® Marie de Medicis at
the baptism of her son wore a robe covered with three thousand diamonds
and tbirty-two thousand other precious stones.^* A courtier considered
himself poor unless he had twenty-five costumes of divers styles.
Sumptu- ary laws were numerous and soon ignored. One, issued by Henry
IV, for- bade “all inhabitants of this kingdom to wear either gold or
silver on their clothes, except prostitutes and thieves,”^® but even
this clever correlation failed. Preachers complained about the
calculated risk that ladies took in only partly covering their curves;
if we may believe Montaigne, who was not often guilty of wishful
thinking, “our ladies (dainty -nice though they be) are many times seen
to go open- breasted as low as the navel.”^* To accentuate white skin or
rosy cheeks, women began in the seventeenth century to adorn them with
spots or patches which the prosaic called mouches, or flies. They
stiffened stays with whalebone and spread their hoopskirts with wire.
They tossed their hair up in a dozen tempting shapes. Men wore theirs in
long and flowing curls, and crowned themselves with broad hats gaily
plumed. Louis XIII, becoming prematurely bald, made the wig fashionable.
The sexes rivaled each other in vanity.</p>
<p>Their fine manners did not deter them from eating with their fingers.
Even in the nobility forks did not replace fingers before 1600, hardly
be- fore 1700 in other ranks. A fashionable restaurant. La Tour d’
Argent, where Henry III dined on his way back from the hunt, achieved
fame by supplying forks. Already in the seventeenth century the French
were eat- ing frogs and snails. Wine was their favorite drink. Coffee
was coming into use, but was not yet indispensable. Chocolate had come
in through Spain from Mexico; some physicians condemned it as an
inopportune lax- ative; others prescribed it for venereal disease; Mme.
de Sevigne told of a pregnant lady who indulged in it so immoderately
that she gave birth to a charming little blackamoor — un petit gargon
noir comme le diable}’’</p>
<p>The improvement in manners was reflected in transportation and amuse-
ments. Public coaches were now common in Western Europe, and in France
the well-to-do began to move about in splendid carrosses equipped with
curtains and glass. Tennis was the rage, and dancing claimed all
classes. The stately pavane came in from Spain, taking its name from the
Spanish for peacock — pavo-, its proud and graceful evolutions gave it
an aristocratic flair, and the kissing that was part of it helped to
circulate the blood. Under Catherine de Medicis the ballet became the
crown of court entertainments, combining music and the dance to tell a
tale in verse or pantomime; her loveliest ladies took part, in costumes
and settings artistically designed; one such ballet was performed in the
Tuileries on the day after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>Musicians were the heroes of the passing hour. They exercised such
fascination on the French that one courtier, at a concert in 1581,
clapped his hand on his sword and swore that he must challenge the first
man he met; thereupon the conductor led his orchestra into a gentle
strain that soothed the savage breast.^® The lute was still the favorite
instrument, but in 1555 Balthazar de Beaujoyeux, the first famous
violinist in history, brought a band of violinists to Catherine’s court
and made violin music popular. In 1600 Ottavio Rinuccini followed Marie
de Medicis into France and intro- duced there the idea of opera. Singing
was still the favorite music, and Pere Mersenne rightly judged that no
other sound in nature could match the beauty of a woman’s voice.^®</p>
<p>Music, literature, fine manners, and cultured conversation now came
to- gether in one of the most basic contributions of France to
civilization — the salon. Italy, alma mater of modern arts, had shown
the way in such urbane gatherings as those ascribed to Urbino in
Castiglione’s Courtier -, it was from Italy that the salon — like the
violin, the chateau, ballet, opera, and syphilis — came to France. Its
founder in France was born in Rome (1588) to Jean de Vivonne, French
ambassador to the papacy, and Giulia Savelli, an Orsini heiress.
Catherine de Vivonne received an education exceptional for a girl of the
sixteenth century. At twelve she was married to Charles d’Angennes, who,
as Marquis of Rambouillet, held high office under Henry IV and Louis
XIII. The young Marquise complained that French speech and manners fell
short of the Italian in correctness and courtesy, and she noted with
disapproval the separation between the intellectual classes — poets,
scholars, scientists, savants — and the nobility. In 1618 she designed
for her family the Hotel de Rambouillet in the Rue St.-Thomas-du-Louvre
in Paris. One room was hung with panels of blue velvet bordered with
silver and gold; in this spacious salon blew the Marquise received her
guests in what became the most celebrated salon in history. She took
care to invite men and women of congenial manners but diverse interests:
nobles like the Great Conde and La Rochefoucauld, ecclesiastics like
Richelieu and Huet, generals like Montausier and Bassompierre, highborn
dames like the Princess of Conti, the duchesses of Longueville and
Rohan, lettered ladies like Mmes. de La Fayette and de Sevigne and Mile,
de Scudery, poets like Malherbe, Chapelain, and Guez de Balzac, scholars
like Conrart and Vaugelas, wits like Voiture and Scarron. Here Bossuet
preached a sermon at the age of twelve, and Corneille read his plays.
Here aristocrats learned to take interest in language, science,
scholarship, poetry, music, and art; men learned from women the graces
of courtesy; authors learned to hide their vanity, savants to humanize
their erudition; wit rubbed elbows with pedigrees; correct speech was
debated and acquired, and con- versation became an art.</p>
<p>The Marquise managed these lions and tigers with a tact that
painlessly</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>trimmed their claws. Despite bearing seven children, she kept her
beauty long enough to inspire passion in Voiture and Malherbe, who,
being poets, kindled into flame at every smile; despite these fires she
was respected by all for her fidelity to her dull husband; despite ill
health, she gave her guests an example of good cheer and sprightly
intelligence; despite losing two sons to death and three daughters to
religion, she silenced her melancholy till she wrote her epitaph. In an
age of sexual license and untamed speech she spread about her a
contagion of manners and decency. Good taste — bon ton, good tone —
became a passport to her salon. Marshals and poets left their swords and
shafts in the vestibule; politeness turned the edge of dif- ference;
discussion flourished, dispute was banned.</p>
<p>At last the refinement was carried to excess. The Marquise drew up a
code of correctness in speech and deed; those who practiced it too
precisely were called precieux or precieuses; and in 1659, when the
Marquise was retired and solitary, Moliere pounced upon these fanciful
residues of her art and finished them off with ridicule. But even the
excess had its use; the precieuses helped to clear the meaning and
connotations of words and phrases, to cleanse the language of
provincialisms, bad grammar, and pedantry; here in germ was the French
Academy. In the Hotel de Ram- bouillet Malherbe, Conrart, and Vaugelas
developed those principles of literary taste that led to Boileau and the
classic age. The precieuses con- tributed to that analysis of the
passions which elongated the romances and lured Descartes and Spinoza;
they helped to embroider the relations of the sexes with that strategy
of retreat, and consequent idealization of the elusive treasure, which
made for romantic love. Through this and the later salons French history
became more than ever bisexual. The status of women rose; their
influence increased in literature, language, politics, and art. The
respect for knowledge and intellect increased, and the sense of beauty
spread.</p>
<p>But would the salons and the Academy have made Rabelais impossible?
Would they have closed the French mind to the gay physiology, the easy
ethic, the proliferating pedantry of Montaigne? Or would they have
forced and raised these geniuses to a subtler and higher art?</p>
<p>We have gone too far forward. Montaigne was twenty-six years dead
when Mme. de Rambouillet opened her salon. Let us turn back in our
course and listen for an hour to the greatest writer and thinker of
France in this age.</p>

<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>399</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE: 1 53 3-92</li>
</ol>
<p>/. Education</p>
<p>Joseph Scaliger described Montaigne’s father as a seller of herring.
The great scholar skipped a generation; it was the grandfather, Grimon
Eyquem, who exported wines and dried fish from Bordeaux. Grimon
inherited the business from Michel’s great -grandfather Ramon Eyquem,
who made the family fortune so, and bought (1447) the mansion and estate
known as Montaigne on a hill outside the city. Grimon expanded his
patrimony with a judicious marriage. His son Pierre Eyquem preferred war
to herring; he joined the French army, soldiered in Italy with Francis
I, returned with scars and a rubbing of the Renaissance, and rose to be
mayor of Bordeaux. In 1528 he married Antoinette, daughter of a wealthy
merchant of Toulouse who was Jewish by birth, Christian by baptism, and
Spanish by cultural background. Michel Eyquem, who became the Sieur
de</p>
<p>Montaigne, was born to Pierre and Antoinette with Gascon and Jewish
blood in his brain. To further broaden his outlook, his father was a
pious Catholic, his mother was probably a Protestant, and a sister and a
brother were Calvinists.</p>
<p>Pierre had ideas on education. “That good father,” Michel tells us,
“even from my cradle sent me to be brought up in a poor village of his,
where he kept me so long as I sucked, and somewhat longer, breeding me
after the meanest and simplest common fashion.”^® While the boy was
still nursing he was given a German attendant who spoke to him only in
Latin. “I was six years old before I understood more of French than of
Arabic.”*^ When he went to the College de Guienne his teachers (except
George Buchanan) were loath to talk Latin to him, he spoke it so glibly.
Such mastery he had acquired “without books, rules, or grammar, without
whip - ping or whining.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the father had read Rabelais on education. He tried to rear
his son on libertarian principles, substituting affection for
compulsion. Mon- taigne relished this regimen and recommended it in a
long letter on educa- tion,<em>^ professedly written for Lady Diane de
FoLx; but in a later essay he recanted it and recommended the rod as a
convincing supplement to reason.</em>® Nor did he follow his father in
giving priority to Latin or the classics. Though his own memory bubbled
over with classical quotations and instances, he deprecated a merely
classical education, scorned book learning and bookworms, and stressed,
rather, the training of the body to health and vigor and of the
character to prudence and virtue. “We have need of little learn ing to
have a good mind,”*^ and a game of tennis may be</p>
<p>400 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS ( CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>more instructive than a diatribe against Catiline. A boy should be
made hardy and brave, able to bear heat and cold without whimpering, and
to relish the inevitable risks of life. Montaigne quoted Athenian
authors, but preferred Spartan ways; his ideal was a manly virtue,
almost in the Roman sense that made such a phrase redundant — to which
he added the Greek ideal of “nothing in excess.” Tem perance in
everything, even in temperance. A man should drink moderately, but be
able, if occasion should require, to drink abundantly without becoming
stupefied.</p>
<p>Travel can form a vital part of education, if we leave our prejudices
at home. “It was t old to Socrates that a certain man had been no whit
im- proved by travel. ‘I believe it well,’ said he, ‘for he carried
himself with him.’ If we can keep our minds and eyes open, the world
will be our</p>
<p>best textbook, for “so many strange humors, sundry s ects . . .
diverse opinions, different laws, and fantastical customs teach us to
judge rightly of ours.”** Next to travel, the best education is history,
which is travel extended into the past. The student “shall, by the help
of histories, inform himself of the worthiest minds that were in the
best ages. . . . What profit shall he not reap . . . reading the Lives
of our Plutarch?”<em>^ Finally, the stu - dent should get some
philosophy — not the “thorny quiddities of logic,” but such philosophy
as “teach es us how to live . . . what it is to know, and not to know;
what valor, temperance, and justice are; what difference there is
between ambition and avarice, bondage and freedom; by what marks a man
may distinguish true and perfect contentment; and how far one ought to
fear . . . death, pain, or disgrace. … A child coming from nurse is more
capable of them 〔such lessons〕 than he is to learn to read or
write.”</em>®</p>
<p>After seven years at the College de Guienne Montaigne proceeded to
university and the study of law. No subject could have been less con-
genial to his discursive mind and limpid speech. He never tired of
praising custom and berating law. He noted with joy that Ferdinand II of
Spain had sent no lawyers to Spanish America, lest they should multiply
disputes among the Indians; and he wished that physicians too had been
forbidden there, lest they make new ailments with their cures.** He
thought those countries worst off that had most laws, and he reckoned
that France had had “more than the rest of the world besides.” He saw no
progress in the humaneness of the law, and doubted if any such savagery
could be found among barbarians as togaed judges and tonsured
ecclesiastics practiced in the torture chambers of European states.®* He
gloried that “to this day 〔1588?〕 I am a virgin from all suits of
law.”®^</p>

<p>Perigueux and in 1561 a member of the Bordeaux Parlement — the mu-
nicipal court. There he met and loved £tienne de La Boetie. We have seen
elsewhere how, about the age of eighteen, this young aristocrat wrote,
but did not publish, a passionate Discours sur la servitude volontaire,
which came to be called Contr’un — ^i.e., against one-man rule. With all
the elo- quence of Danton, it called upon the people to rise against
absolutism. Per- haps Montaigne himself felt some republican ardor in
his youth. In any case, he was drawn to the noble rebel, who, three
years older, seemed a paragon of wisdom and integrity.</p>
<p>We sought one another before we had seen one another, and, by</p>
<p>the reports we heard of one another … I think by some secret
ordi-</p>
<p>nance of the heavens we embraced one another by our names. And at our
first meeting, which was by chance at a great feast and solemn</p>
<p>meeting of a whole township, we found ourselves so surprised, so . .
. acquainted, and so . . . bound together, that from thenceforward</p>
<p>nothing w as so near to us as one unto another.®*</p>
<p>Why this profound attachment? Montaigne answered, “Because it was he,
because it was I”®® — because they were so different that they completed
each other. For La Boetie was all idealism, warm devotion, tenderness;
Montaigne was too intellectual, prudent, impartial to be so dedicated;
this very friend described him as “equally inclined to both outstanding
vices and virtues.”®^ Perhaps the deepest experience of Montaigne’s life
was watching his friend die. In 1563, during a plague at Bordeaux, La
Boetie fell suddenly ill with fever and dysentery. He bore his lingering
death with a stoic fortitude and a Christian patience never forgotten by
his friend, who stayed at his bedside during those final days. Montaigne
inherited the manu- script of the dangerous essay and concealed it for
thirteen years; a copy was printed in a pirated edition (1576);
thereupon he published the original, and explained that it was the
rhetorical exercise of a boy of “six - teen.”</p>
<p>That friendship made every later human relationship seem insipid to
Montaigne. He wrote, again and again, that half of him had died with La
Boetie. “I was so accustom ed to be ever two, and so inured to be never
single, that methinks I am but half myself.”®® In the warmth of that
memory he placed friendship above the love between father and son, maid
and youth, husband and wife. He himself seems to have had no romantic
pas- sion for any woman: “In my youth I opposed myself to the notions
of</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>love, which I felt to usurp upon me; and I labored to diminish its
enjoy- ment, lest in the end it might . . . captivate me t o its
mercy.”®* Not that he lacked erotic hours; on the contrary, he
acknowledges premarital relations of proud scope and frequency.®^ He
described sexual love as no “other than a tickling delight of emptying
one’s seminary 〔sic〕 vessels, as is the pleasure which nature giveth
us to discharge other parts”; and he thought it absurd that nature “hath
pell - mell lodged our joys and filths together.”®®</p>
<p>He agreed with most philosophers that the itch to detumesce is no
reason for marriage. “I see no mar riages fail sooner, or more troubled,
than such as are concluded for beauty’s sake, or huddled up for amorous
desires.”®* Marriage should be arranged by “a third hand”; it should
reject the com - pany and conditions of 〔sexual〕 love” and should try
“to i mitate those of friendship”; marriage must become friendship to
survive. He inclined to the view of Greek thinkers that a man should not
marry before thirty. He avoided the tie as long as he could. Still
single at twenty-eight, he traveled to Paris, fell in love with it,^®
enjoyed the life of the court for a while (1562), saw some American
Indians at Rouen, hesitated between the rival charms of civilization and
savagery, returned to Bordeaux, and married (1565) Fran5oise de
Chassaigne.</p>
<p>He seems to have married for strictly rational reasons: to have a
home and a family, to transmit his estate and his name. Amid all his
fifteen hundred pages he says almost nothing of his wife — ^but that may
have been good manners. He claims to have been faithful t o her:
“Licentious as the world reputes me, I had (in good faith) more strictly
observed the laws of wedlock than either I had promised or hoped.”^^ She
made allowances for the self-absorption of genius; she took competent
care of the household, the land, even the accounts, for he had no mind
for business. For his part, he gave her full respect, and now and then a
sign or word of love — as when he responded gratefully to her quick aid
after his fall from a horse, and when he dedicated to her his edit ion
of La Boetie’s translation of Plutarch’s Letter of Consolation. It was a
successful marriage, and we must not take very seriously the quips
against women in the Essays-, they were a fashion among philosophers.
Frangoise bore him six children, all girls; all died in childhood but
one, of whom he speaks tenderly.^® When he was fifty-four he adopted
into the family a twenty-year-old girl, Marie de Gournay, “truly of me
beloved with more than a fatherly love, and as one of the best parts of
my being, enfeoffed in my home and solitariness.”*® He was not above the
common feelings of humanity.</p>

<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>403</p>
<p>3 . The Essays</p>
<p>In 1568 his father died, and Michel, as the oldest son, inherited the
estate. Three or four years later he resigned from the Parliament of
Bordeaux, and retired from the bedlam of the city to the boredom of the
countryside. Even there peace was precarious, for religious war was
dividing France, its cities, and its families. Soldiers raided villages,
entered homes, stole, raped, and killed. “I have a thousand times gone
to bed . . . imagining I should, the very same night, have been either
betrayed or slain in my bed.”^^ As a dissuasion to violence, he left his
doors unlocked and gave orders that if marauders came they were to be
received without resistance. They stayed away, and Montaigne was left
free to live in his corner of philosophy amid the clatter of creeds and
arms. While Paris and some provinces murdered Protestants in the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew, Mon- taigne wrote the supreme work of
French prose.</p>
<p>His favorite retreat wais the library on the third floor of the tower
that rose in the fa9ade of his chateau. (The chateau was destroyed by
fire in 1885, but the tower survived.) He loved his library as himself,
his alter ego. The form of it is round, and hath no flat side but what
serveth</p>
<p>for my table and chair; in which . . . manner at one look it offers
me</p>
<p>the full sight of all my books . . . There is my seat, there is my
throne.</p>
<p>I endeavor to make my rule therein absolute, and to sequester
that</p>
<p>only comer from the community of wife, of children, and of ac-</p>
<p>quaintance.*®</p>
<p>Seldom has a man so relished solitude, which is almost our direst
dread.</p>
<p>A man must sequester and recover himself from himself … We</p>
<p>should reserve a storehouse for ourselves . . . altogether ours . .
.</p>
<p>wherein we may hoard up and establish our true liberty. The greatest
thing in the world is for a man to know how to be his own.**</p>
<p>In that library he had a thousand books, most of them bound in tooled
leather. He called them ’^meas delicias“ (my delights). In them he could
choose his company and live with the wisest and the best. In Plutarch
alone, “since he spoke French” (through Amyot), he could find a hun -
dred great men to come and talk with him, and in Seneca’s Epistles he
could savor a pleasant Stoicism melodiously phrased; these two (includ-
ing Plutarch’s Moralia) were his favorite authors, “from whom, like the
Danaides, I draw my water, incessantly filling as fast as emptying*^ . .
. The familiarity I have with them, and the aid they afford me in my
old</p>
<p>404 the age of reason begins (chap. XVI</p>
<p>age, and my book merely framed of their spoils, binds me to maintain
their honor.”^®</p>
<p>He never quotes the Bible (perhaps as too well known), though he</p>
<p>frequently cites St. Augustine. For the most part he prefers the
ancients to the moderns, the pagan philosophers to the Christian
Fathers. He was a humanist insofar as he loved the literature and the
history of old Greece and Rome; but he was no indiscriminate idolater of
classics and manu- scripts; he thought Aristotle superficial and Cicero
a windbag. He was not quite at home with the Greeks. He quoted the Latin
poets with roaming erudition, even one of Martial’s most privy epigrams.
He admired Virgil, but preferred Lucretius. He read Erasmus’ Adagia
predaceou sly. In the early essays he was a pedant, adorning himself
with classical tags. Such excerpts were in the manner of the age;
readers who had no competence for the originals relished these samples
as little windows glimpsing</p>
<p>antiquity, and some complained that there were not more.^® From all
his pilfering Montaigne emerged uniquely himself, laughing at pedantry
and making up his own mind and speech. He looks like scissors and paste,
and tastes like ambrosia.</p>
<p>So, leisurely, page by page and day by day, after 1570, he wrote
his</p>
<p>Essais* He seems to have invented the term,®® almost the type; for
though there had been discorsi and discours, they were formidably
formal, not the informal, meandering conversations of Montaigne; and
this easygoing, buttonholing style has tended to characterize the essay
since his death, making it a predominantly modern genre. “I speak to
paper,” he said, “as I do to the first person I meet.”®^ The style is
the man, natural, intimate, con - fidential; it is a comfort to be
spoken to so familiarly by a seigneur of the mind. Open him at any page,
and you are caught by the arm and swept along, never knowing, and seldom
caring, where you will go. He wrote piecemeal, on any subject that
struck his thought or matched his mood; and he diverged anarchically
from the initial topic as he rambled on; so the essay “On Coaches”
rattles off into ancient Rome and new America. Of the three volumes,
three consist of digressions. Montaigne was lazy, and nothing is so
arduous as producing and maintaining order in ideas or men. He confessed
himself divers et ondoyant — wavering and diverse. He made no fetish of
consistency; he changed his opinions with his years; only the final
composite picture is Montaigne.</p>
<p>Amid the confused flux of his notions his style is as clear as the
soul of simplicity. Yet it sparkles with metaphors as surprising as
Shakespeare’s,</p>
<p>•The first edition, 1580, contained Books I and II; the second, 1588,
expanded these and added Book III; the third, containing his final
revision and edited by Mile, de Gournay, appeared in 1595, after his
death. The nine editions between 1580 and 1598 attest their
popularity.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>and with illuminating anecdotes that instantaneously transform the
abstract into the real. His probing curiosity snatches at such instances
anywhere, admitting no moral hindrance. He carefully hands down to us
the remark of the Toulouse woman who, having been handled by several
soldiers, thanked God that “once in my life I have had my bellyful
without sin.”®* Nihil naturae alienum putat.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Philosopher</li>
</ol>
<p>He claims to have only one subject — himself. “I look within myself;
I have no business but with myself; I incessantly consider . . . and
taste myself.”®® He proposes to study human nature at first hand,
through his own impulses, habits, likes, dislikes, ailments, feelings,
prejudices, fears, and ideas. He does not offer us an autobiography; he
says almost nothing, in the Essays, about his career as a councilor or
mayor, about his travels, his visits to the court. He does not wear his
religion or his politics on his sleeve. He gives us something more
precious — a frank and penetrating analysis of his body, mind, and
character. He expounds his faults and vices with pleasure and at length.
To accomplish his purpose he asks permission to speak freely; he will
violate good taste to exhibit a man naked in body and soul. He talks
with noisy candor about his natural functions, quotes St. Augustine and
Vives on melodic flatulence, and meditates on coitus:</p>
<p>Each one avoideth to see a man bom, but all run hastily to see
him</p>
<p>die. To destroy him we seek a spacious field and full light; but to
con- struct him we hide ourselves in some dark comer and work as close
as we may.®*</p>
<p>Even so, he claims to have practiced some reticence. “I speak truth,
not my bellyful, but as much as I dare.”®®</p>
<p>He tells us a great deal about his physical self, and he nurses his
health from page to page. Health is the sunrmum bonum. “Renown or glory
is overdearly bought by a man of my humor, in God’s name.”®® He records
the vicissitudes of his bowels in affectionate detail. He sought the
philoso- pher’s stone and found it lodged in his bladder. He hoped to
pass these pebbles in some amorous ecstasy, but found, instead, that
they “do</p>
<p>strangely diswench me,”®^ threatening him with inopportune
disablement. He consoled himself with his proud capacity to “hold my
water full ten hours,”®® and to be in the saddle long hours without
exhausting fatigue. He was stout and strong, and he ate so avidly that
he almost bit his fingers in his greed. He loved himself with
indefatigable virtuosity.</p>
<p>4o6 the age of reason begins (chap. XVI</p>
<p>He was vain of his genealogy, his coat of arms,®* his fine dress, and
his distinction as a Chevalier of St. Michael — and wrote an essay “Of
Vanity.” He pretends to most of the vices, and assures us that if there
is any virtue in him it entered by stealth. He had many nevertheless:
honesty, geniality, humor, equanimity, pity, moderation, tolerance. He
tossed explosive ideas into the air, but caught and extinguished them
before they fell. In an age of dogmatic slaughter he begged his fellow
men to moderate their certain- ties this side of murder; and he gave the
modern world one of its first examples of a tolerant mind. We forgive
his faults because we share them. And we find his self-analysis
fascinating because we know that it is about us that the tale is
told.</p>
<p>To understand himself better he studied the philosophers. He loved
them despite their vain pretensions to analyze the universe and chart
man’s destiny beyond the grave. He quoted Cicero as remarking that
“nothing can be said so absurd but that it has been said by one of the
philosophers.”®® He praised Socrates for “bringing human wisdom down
from heaven, where for a long time it had been lost, to restore it to
man again,”®’ and he echoed Socrates’ advice to study natural science
less and human conduct more. He had no “system” of his own; his ideas
were in such restless evolution that no label could pin down his
philosophic flight.</p>
<p>In the brave morning of his thought he adopted Stoicism. Since Chris-
tianity, splitting into fratricidal sects and bloodying itself with war
and massacre, had apparently failed to give man a moral code capable of
con- trolling his instincts, Montaigne turned to philosophy for a
natural ethic, a morality not tied to the rise and fall of religious
creeds. Stoicism seemed to have approached this ideal; at least it had
molded some of the finest men of antiquity. For a time Montaigne made it
his ideal. He would train his will to self-mastery; he would shun all
passions that might disturb the decency of his conduct or the
tranquillity of his mind; he would face all vicissitudes with an even
temper and take death itself as a natural and for- givable
fulfillment.</p>
<p>Some Stoic strain continued in him to the end, but his effervescent
spirit soon found another philosophy to justify itself. He rebelled
against a Stoicism that preached the following of “Nature” and yet
strove to sup - press nature in man. He interpreted Nature through his
own nature, and decided to follow his natural desires whenever they did
no perceivable harm. He was pleased to find Epicurus no coarse
sensualist but a sane de- fender of sane delights; and he was astonished
to discover so much wisdom and grandeur in Lucretius. Now he proclaimed
with enthusiasm the</p>
<p>legitimacy of pleasure. The only sin that he recognized was excess.
“In - temperance is the pestilence which killeth pleasure; temperance is
not the flail of pleasure, it is t he seasoning thereof.”**</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS 407</p>
<p>From the oscillation of his views, and the degradation of
contemporary Christianity in France, he came to the skepticism that
thereafter colored most of his philosophy. His father had been impressed
by the Theologia naturalis of the Toulouse theologian Raymond of Sabunde
(d. 1437?), who had continued the noble effort of the Scholastics to
prove the reason- ableness of Christianity. The father asked his son to
translate the treatise; Montaigne did, and published his translation
(1569). Orthodox France was edified, but some critics objected to
Raymond’s reasoning. In 1580 Montaigne inserted into the second “book”
of his Essais a two -hundred- pa ge “Apologie de 〔Defense of〕 Raimond
Sebond,” in which he proposed to answer the objections. But he did so
only by abandoning his author’s enterprise, arguing that reason is a
limited and untrustworthy instru- ment, and that it is better to rest
rehgion on faith in the Scriptures and in Holy Mother Church; in effect
Montaigne demolished Raymond while purporting to uphold him. Some, like
Sainte-Beuve, have judged this “Apology” as a tongue -in-the-cheek
argument for unbelief.*® In any case, it is the m ost destructive of
Montaigne’s compositions, perhaps the most thoroughgoing exposition of
skepticism in modern literature.</p>
<p>Long before Locke, Montaigne affirms that “all knowledge is addressed
to us by the senses,”®^ and that reason depends upon the se nses; but
the senses are deceptive in their reports and severely limited in their
range; therefore reason is unreliable. “Both the inward and the outward
parts of man are full of weakness and falsehood.”®* (Here, at the very
outset of the Age of Reason, a generation before Bacon and Descartes,
Montaigne asks the question that they would not stop to ask, that Pascal
would ask eighty years later, that the philosophers would not face till
Hume and Kant: Why should we trust reason?) Even instinct is a safer
guide than reason. See how well the animals get along by instinct —
^sometimes more wisely than men. “There is a greater difference between
many a man and many an - other man than between many a man and m any an
animal.”®® Man is no more the center of life than the earth is the
center of the universe. It is presumptuous of man to think that God
resembles him, or that human affairs are the center of God’s interest,
or that the world exists to serve man. And it is ridiculous to suppose
that the mind of man can fathom the nature of God. “O senseless man, who
cannot make a worm and yet will make gods by the dozen!”®^</p>
<p>Montaigne arrives at skepticism by another route — by contemplating
the variety and fluctuation of beliefs in laws and morals, in science,
philosophy, and religion; which of these truths is truth? He prefers the
Copernican to the Ptolemaic astronomy, but: “Who knows whether, a
thousand years hence, a third opinion will rise, which haply may
overthrow these two,” and “whether it be not more likely that this huge
body, which we call the</p>
<p>4o8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>World, is another manner of thing than we judge it?”®* “There is no
science,” only the proud hypotheses of immodest minds.®* Of all the
philosophies the best is Pyrrho’s — that we know nothing. “The greatest
part of what we know is the least part of what we know not.”™ “Nothing
is so firmly believed as that which is lea st known,” and “a persuasion
of certainty is a manifest testimony of foolishness.”^^ “In few words,
there</p>
<p>Thereafter he applied his skepticism to everything, always with
an</p>
<p>obeisance to the Church. “Que sais - je? What do I know?” became his
motto, engraved on his seal and inscribed on his library ceiling. Other
mottoes adorned the rafters: “The for and against are both possible”;
“It may be and it may not be”; “I determine nothing. I do not compre -
hend things; I suspend judgment; I examine.”™ Something of this
attitude</p>
<p>Now he saw relativity everywhere, and nowhere absolutes. Least of all
in standards of beauty; and our lusty philosopher revels in noting the
diverse opinions among divers peoples as to what constitutes beauty in a
woman’s breasts.’‘® He believes that many beasts surpass us in beauty
and thinks we were wise to clothe ourse lves. He perceives that a man’s
religion and his moral ideas are usually determined by his environment.
“The taste of good or evil greatly depends upon the opinion we have of
them,” as Shakespeare was to say; and: “Men are tormented by the
opinions they have of things, not by the things themselves.”” The laws
of conscience proceed not from God but from custom. Conscience is the
discomfort we feel when violating the mores of our tribe.’®</p>
<p>Montaigne had better sense than to suppose that because morals are
relative they may therefore be ignored. On the contrary, he would be the
last to disturb their stability. He talks boldly about sex, and claims
much freedom — for men; but when you cross-examine him you find him sud-
denly orthodox. He recommends chastity to youth, on the ground that
energy spent in sex comes from the common store of force in the body; he
notes that athletes training for the Olympic games “abstained from all
venerean acts and touching of women.”’®</p>
<p>It was part of his humor to extend his skepticism to civilization
itself, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>409</p>
<p>to anticipate Rousseau and Chateaubriand. The Indians he had seen at
Rouen inspired him to read the reports of travelers; from these accounts
he composed his essay “Of Cannibals.” Eating dead people, he thought,
was less barbarous than torturing live ones. “I find nothing in that
nation 〔Indian America〕 that is either barbarous or savage, unless men
call that barbarism which is not common amo ng themselves.”®® He
imagined these natives as rarely sick, as nearly always happy, and as
living peaceably with- out laws.®^ He praised Aztec art and Inca roads.
He put into the mouth of his Rouen Indians an indictment of European
wealth and poverty; “ They had perceived there were men amongst us full
gorged with all sorts of com- modities, and others that were dying of
hunger; and they marveled that the needy ones could endure such an
injustice and took not the others by the throat.”®* He compared t he
morals of the Indians with those of their conquerors, and charged that
“the pretended Christians . . . brought the contagion of vice to
innocent souls eager to learn and by nature well disposed.”®® For a
moment Montaigne forgot his geniality and burs t into noble
indignation:</p>
<p>So many goodly cities ransacked and razed; so many nations</p>
<p>destroyed or made desolate; so infinite millions of harmless people
of all sexes, status, and ages, massacred, ravaged, and put to the
sword; and the richest, the fairest, the best part of the world
topsyturvied,</p>
<p>ruined, and defaced for the traffic of pearls and peppers! Oh,
mechan- ical victories, oh, base conquest!®^</p>
<p>Was his obeisance to religion sincere? Obviously his classical
foraging had long since weaned him from the doctrines of the Church. He
re- tained a vague belief in God conceived sometimes as Nature,
sometimes as a cosmic soul, the incomprehensible intelligence of the
world. At times he presages Shakespeare’s Lear; “The gods play at
handball with us, and toss us up and down”;®® but he ridicules atheism
as “unnatural and mon - strous”®® and rejects agnosticism as another
dogmatism — how do we know that we shall never know?®^ He waives aside
as pretentious futilities all attempts to define the soul or to explain
its relation to the body.®® He is willing to accept the immortality of
the soul on faith, but finds no evidence for it in experience or
reason;®® and the idea of eternal existence appalls him.®® “Except for
faith, I believe not miracles”;®^ and he anticipates Hume’s famous
argument: “How much more natural and likely do I find it that two men
should lie than that one man in twelve hours should be carried by the
winds from East to West?”®* (He might seek another</p>
<p>410 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Christian by geographical accident; otherwise “I should rather have
taken part with those who worshiped the sun.”®* So far as one reader can
recall, he mentions Christ but once.®® The lovely saga of the Mother of
Christ made only a moderate appeal to his unsentimental soul; however,
he crossed Italy to lay four votive figures before her shrine at Loreto.
He lacked those marks of the religious spirit — humility, a sense of
sin, remorse and penance, a longing for divine forgiveness and redeeming
grace. He was a freethinker with an allergy for martyrdom.</p>
<p>He remained a Catholic long after he had ceased to be a Christian.®®
Like some sensible early Christian bowing transiently to a pagan deity,
Montaigne, the most pagan of Christians, turned aside now and then from
his selected Greeks and Romans to honor the cross of Christ, or even to
kiss the foot of a pope. He did not, like Pascal, pass from skepticism
to faith, but from skepticism to observance. And not merely through
caution. He probably realized that his own philosophy, paralyzed with
hesitations, contradictions, and doubt, could safely be the luxury only
of a spirit already formed to civilization (by religion?), and that
France, even while bathing its creeds in blood, would never exchange
them for an intellectual labyrinth in which death would be the only
certainty. He thought a wise philosophy would make its peace with
religion:</p>
<p>Simple minds, less curious, less well instructed, are made good
Chris- tians, and through reverence and obedience hold their simple
belief and abide by the laws. In intellects of moderate vigor and
capacity is engendered the error of opinions. . . . The best, most
settled, and</p>
<p>clearest-seeing spirits make another sort of well-believers, who
by</p>
<p>long and religious investigation, penetrate to a more profound
and</p>
<p>abstruse meaning in the Scriptures and discover the mysterious and
divine secrets of our ecclesiastical polity. . . . The simple
peasants</p>
<p>are honest folk, and so are the philosophers.®^</p>
<p>So, after all his barbs at Christianity, and because all faiths alike
are</p>
<p>cloaks to cover our shivering ignorance, he advises us to accept the
religion of our time and place. He himself, true to his geography,
returned to the ritual of his fathers. He liked a sensory, fragrant,
ceremonial religion, and so he preferred Catholicism to Protestantism.
He was repelled by the Calvinist emphasis on predestination;®® being of
Erasmian lineage, he liked the genial and worldly cardinals of Rome more
than the Loyola of Geneva or the lion of Wittenberg. He regretted
particularly that the new creeds were imitating the intolerance of the
old. Though he laughed at heretics as fools who raised a fuss over
competitive mythologies, he saw no sense in burning such mavericks.
“After all, it is setting a high value on our</p>
<p>opinions to roast people alive on account of them”®® or to let people
roast us.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>411</p>
<p>In politics too he ended as a comfortable conservative. There is no
use changing forms of government; the new one will be as bad as the old,
because it will be administered by men. Society is so “vast a frame,” so
complex a mechanism of instinct, custom, myth, and law, slowly fashioned
by the trial-and-error wisdom of time, that no individual intellect,
how- ever powerful and brilliant, can take it apart and put it together
again without incalculable confusion and suffering.^®® Better submit to
current rulers, bad as they are, unless they attempt to chain thought
itself; then Montaigne might screw his courage up to revolt, for “my
reason is not framed to bend or stoop; my knees are.”<sup>®</sup> A wise
man will avoid public office, while respecting it; “the greatest
vocation is to save the c ommon- wealth and be profitable to many”; but
“as for me, I depart from it.”<sup>®</sup> However, he served his
terms.</p>
<p>He mourned that half his life had been lived during the ruination
of</p>
<p>France,^®* “in an age so corrupt and times so ignorant.” “Read all
ancie nt stories, be they never so tragical, you shall find none to
equal those we daily see practiced.”<sup>®</sup> He was not neutral in
the duel for France, but “my interest has not made me forget either the
commendable qualities of our adversaries or the reproach ful qualities
of those whom I have supported.”^®® He would not shoulder a gun, but his
pen was with the Politiques, those peace-preferring Catholics who
advocated some compromise with the Huguenots. He lauded Michel de
L’Hopital for farsighted humanitar ian moderation, and he rejoiced when
his friend Henry of Navarre moved to victory on the policies of
L’Hopital. Montaigne was the most civilized of Frenchmen in that savage
age.</p>
<p>5 . The Rolling Stone</p>
<p>The stones in his bladder bothered him more than the wars of France.
In June 1 580, shortly after the first publication of the Essays, he set
out on an extended tour of Western Europe, partly to see the world,
partly to visit medicinal springs in the hope of alleviating the “colic”
(as he</p>
<p>called it) that repeatedly incapacitated him with pain. He left his
wife behind to take care of the estate; but he took with him a younger
brother, a brother-in-law, the Baron of Estissac, and a secretary to
whom he</p>
<p>dictated part of his travel diary; add a retinue of servants and
muleteers, and we no longer wonder that these memoirs are intellectually
thin. They were meant rather for remembrance than for publication;
Montaigne, returning, hid them in a chest, where they were discovered
178 years after his death.</p>
<p>The party went first to Paris, where the proud author presented a
copy of the Essays to Henry III; then by easy stages to Plombieres,

<p>Montaigne for nine days drank two quarts of medicinal waters daily
and succeeded in passing some small stones with great pain.^“® Then
through Lorraine to Switzerland. “He had infinite pleasure,” says the
third -person diary, “in observing the freedom and good government of
this nation.”^®’’ He took the waters at Baden-Baden and advanced into
Germany. He at- tended Calvinist and Lutheran as well as Catholic
services, and discussed theology with Protestant clergymen. He tells of
one Lutheran minister who vowed that he would rather hear a thousand
Masses than partake of one Calvinist Communion^®® — for the Calvinists
denied the physical pres- ence of Christ in the Eucharist. Moving into
the Tirol, he felt the grandeur of the Alps long before Rousseau. From
Innsbruck the party mounted to th e Brenner Pass, Montaigne passing on
the way “a stone of middling size.” Then through Trent to Verona,
Vicenza, Padua, and Venice, where he contributed “two big stones” to the
Grand Canal. He thought the city not so wonderful as he had expected,
nor the prostitutes as beautiful. On to Ferrara, where (according to the
Essays, not the diary) he visited the insane Tasso; to Bologna and
Florence, where the Arno received “two - tion-excretions would have
built a pretty pyramid.</p>
<p>In Rome he visited a Jewish synagogue, witnessed a circumcision, and
discussed with the rabbis their religious rites. He exchanged
philosophies with the Roman courtesans. He was not (as Stendhal thought)
insensitive to the art in Rome.*** He wandered day after day among the
classic re- mains, never ceasing to marvel at their grandeur. But the
great event was a visit to Gregory XIII. Like any son of the Church,
Montaigne knelt to kiss the papal shoe, which the Pope kindly raised to
ease the operation.**® Meanwhile the customs officials had found a copy
of the Essays, which they turned over to the Inquisition. Montaigne was
summoned to the Holy Office and was gently admonished that some passages
smelled of heresy; would he not change or delete them in future
editions? He promised. “I thought I left them very well satisfied with
me”; indeed, they invited him to come and live in Rome. (He kept his
promise indifferently, and in 1676 his book was placed on the Index.)
Perhaps to reassure them and himself, he journeyed across Italy to the
shrine of the Virgin at Loreto and dedicated a votive tablet to her.
Then he recrossed the Apennines to take the waters at Lucca.</p>
<p>There (September 7, 1581) a message came, saying that he had been
chosen mayor of Bordeaux. He asked to be excused, but Henry III bade him
accept, and the tradition of public service left him by his father could
not be ignored. He took his time getting back to France; he did not
sight his chateau till November 30, seventeen months after beginning the
tour.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>413</p>
<p>The duties of the mayoralty were light; the emoluments were honors
without pay. He functioned sufficiently well, for he was re-elected</p>
<p>(August 1583) for another two years. In December 1584 Henry of</p>
<p>Navarre, with a mistress and forty followers, visited him, and the
future king of France slept in the philosopher’s bed. Toward the end of
the sec - ond term plague struck Bordeaux, and Montaigne, like nearly
all public officials, left the city for rural retreats. On July 30,
1585, he turned over the insignia of his office to a successor and
retired to his home.</p>
<p>He was only fifty-two, but his stones periodically disabled him,
some- times preventing him for days from passing water.“® Early in 1588
he was strong enough to make a third trip to Paris. While there he was
arrested, as an adherent of Henry III, by the League then dominating the
capital; he was lodged in the Bastille (July 10, 1588), but was released
the same evening through the intercession of Catherine de Medicis. In
October he attended the States-General at Blois, but he returned to
Bordeaux just in time to escape involvement in the vicissitudes of Henry
III after the</p>
<p>assassination of the Duke of Guise.</p>
<p>In his final and finest essay, “Of Experience,” he included a
description of his physical decay. His te eth, for example, seemed to
have reached “the natural term of their continuance.””^ He endured his
“going hence” with - out bitterness. He had lived his life very much as
he had planned it, and he could write with pride: “View all antiquity
over, and you shall find it a hard matter to choose out a dozen men that
have directed their lives unto one certain, settled . . . course, which
is the sweetest drift of wisdom.””® Told that his end was near, he
gathered his household and his legatees about him, and gave them in
person the sums or objects he had bequeathed them in his will. He
received the sacraments of the Church as piously as if he had never
written a doubting word. He died September 13, 1592, aged
fifty-nine.</p>
<p>His influence pervaded three centuries and four continents. Richelieu
accepted with pleasure the dedication of Mile, de Gournay’s final
edition of the Essays. His friend and disciple Charron, as early as
1603, developed them into a formal and orderly philosophy. Florio made
them into an English classic (1603), but overlaid his author’s brief
simplicity with</p>
<p>erudite verbosity. Shakespeare may have seen that translation and
been helped to form and phrase the skepticism of his greatest tragedies;
we have noted his specific debts. Perhaps Ben Jonson had Shakespeare in
mind when he accused English writers of stealing from Montaigne.”* Bacon
felt that influence, and Descartes may have found in the Essays the
stimulus to his initial universal doubt. Pascal went almost insane
trying to salvage his faith from Montaigne’s questionings. From
Montaigne stemmed Bayle,</p>
<p>414</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>Vauvenargues, Rousseau, Diderot, Voltaire — Rousseau from Montaigne’s
confessions and his e ssays “Of Education” and “Of Cannibals,” Voltaire
from all the rest. Montaigne was the grandfather, as Bayle was the
father, of the Enlightenment. Mme. du Deffand, the least deceived woman
of her brilliant age, wished to “throw into the fire all the immense
volumes of the philosophers except Montaigne, who is the father of them
all.”^^^ Through Alontaigne the psychological analysis of mind and
character entered into French literature, from Corneille and Moliere, La
Rochefoucauld and La Bruy ere to Anatole France. Thoreau took much at
this fountainhead, and Emerson bathed himself in it before writing his
own Essays. Of Mon- taigne, as of few authors before the eighteenth
century, it may be said that he is read today as if he had written
yesterday.</p>
<p>The world has long since recognized and forgiven his faults. He
ad-</p>
<p>mitted so many that he almost depleted the armory of his critics. He
knew quite well that he was garrulous and vain. We tire, now and then,
of his classical quotations, and for a moment fall into Malebranche’s
unjust judgment of the Essays as “nothing but a tissue of historical
anecdotes, little stories, bon mots, verses, and apothegms . . . proving
nothing.”^^® Unquestionably Montaigne jumbles his wares into a lazy
disarray, so lessening their impact and point. He contradicts himself in
a hundred subjects; he is bound to be right, since he says everything
and its opposite. There is something paralyzing in universal skepticism;
it preserves us from theological homicide, but it takes the wind out of
our sails and drains us of fortitude. We are’ more deeply moved by
Pascal’s desperate attempt to save his faith from Montaigne than by
Montaigne’s willingness to have no faith at all.</p>
<p>We cannot put our hearts into such criticism; it interrupts only
pass- ingly our joy in the gay a ciencia, the laughing learning, the
allegro pen- sieroso, of this unsilenceable gossiper. Where again shall
we find so animated a synthesis of wisdom and humor? There is a subtle
similarity between these two qualities, since both may come from seeing
things in perspective; in Montaigne they make one man. His loquacity is
redeemed by quaintness and clarity; there are no shopworn phrases here,
no pompous absurdity. We are so weary of language used to conceal
thought or its absence that we can overlook the egoism in these
self-revelations. We are surprised to see how well this amiable causeur
knows our hearts; we are relieved to find our faults shared by so wise a
man, and by him so readily absolved. It is comforting to see that he too
hesitates and does not know; we are delighted to be told that our
ignorance, if realized, becomes philosophy. And what a relief it is,
after St. Bartholomew, to come upon a man who is not sure enough to
kill!</p>
<p>Finally, and despite his onslaught upon reason, we perceive that</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>415</p>
<p>Montaigne begins in France, as Bacon in England, the Age of Reason.
Alontaigne, the critic of reason, was nothing if not reason itself. With
all his curtsies to the Church, this irrationalist was a rationalist. He
consented to conform only after he had sown the seeds of reason in the
mind of France. And if, like Bacon, he tried to do this without
disturbing the</p>
<p>consolatory faith of the poor, we must not hold his caution or
tenderness against him. He was not made for burning. He knew that he too
might be wrong; he was the apostle of moderation as well as of reason;
and he was too much of a gentleman to set his neighbor’s house on fire
before he had any other shelter to give him. He was profounder than
Voltaire because he sympathized with that which he destroyed.</p>
<p>Gibbon reckoned “in those bigoted times but two men o f liberality
〔of free and generous ideas〕 in France; Henry IV and Montaigne.”^^®
And Sainte-Beuve, after viewing Montaigne unsympathetically through the
eyes of Pascal,^®® ended by pronouncing him, in a rare burst of
enthusiasm, “le Frangais le plus sage qui ait jamais existS” — “the
wisest Frenchman that ever lived.</p>

<li>IMMORTALS FOR A DAY</li>
</ol>
<p>After Montaigne French literature rested on his oars for a
generation. He had almost succeeded in escaping the Religious Wars,
hiding himself in himself till they passed by. Elsewhere the
martial-theologic fever</p>
<p>blighted letters in France: between Montaigne and Corneille she fell
behind England and Spain in literature, just as England fell behind
France after the Civil War. A succession of gaseous comets crossed the
firmament, leaving no fixed stars. Richelieu tried to nurse genius with
pensions, but he hampered it with censorship and suborned it to his
praise. When he died the pensions were canceled by Louis XIII with a
shrug of the pen: “We’re not going to be troubled with that any more.”
More stimulating to literature were the literary soirees of the Hotel de
Rambouillet and Richelieu’s establishment of the French Academy.</p>
<p>The Academy began in gatherings of scholars and authors in a private
home — that of Valentin Conrart, a secretary to the King (1627). Riche-
lieu, alert to letters as well as war, envying the academies of Italy
and the literature of Spain, offered to constitute the group as a public
body recog- nized by the state. Some members opposed the plan as a bribe
to orthodoxy; but the poet Chapelain (who was enjoying a pension from
the Cardinal) reminded them that “they had to do with a man who willed
in no half - hearted way whatever he willed.”^®® Chapelain’s caution
prevailed; the group unanimously resolved to “accede to the pleasure of
his Eminence,”</p>
<p>4i6 the age of reason begins (chap. XVI</p>
<p>and was incorporated (1635) as the Academie Frangaise. Its statutes
de- clared that</p>
<p>it seems that naught was wanting to the happiness of the kingdom</p>
<p>but to take this language, which we speak, out of the list of
barbarous tongues . . . that, already more perfect than any other living
language, it might at length fairly succeed to the Latin as the Latin
had to the</p>
<p>Greek, if more care were taken than hitherto; that the functions
of</p>
<p>the Academicians should be to purify the language from the
defile-</p>
<p>ments which it had contracted, whether in the mouths of the people,
or in the crowds of the law courts … or by the bad habits of</p>
<p>ignorant courtiers.^^^</p>
<p>One of the original thirty members, Claude Vaugelas, was charged with
compiling a dictionary; fifty-six years were to elapse before its first
pub- lication (1694). Meanwhile the Academy raised significantly the
status of literary men; to be one of the (by 1637) forty “Immortals”
became as great an honor as to stand high in the government; no nation
has so honored letters as France. Frequently the Academy, composed
mostly of old men, acted as a conservative brake upon literary
developments or linguistic growth; now and then it closed its doors to
genius (Moliere, Rousseau) ; but it kept its head above the factions,
and taught its members a courteous tolerance of diverse ideas; and
France rewarded it with a permanence that stood the shocks of change
while so much else gave way.</p>
<p>Having corralled the poets and the scholars, Richelieu cast his
watchful eye upon the journalists. In May 1631 Theophraste Renaudot, ai
ded by‘ the Cardinal, began publication of the first French newspaper,
afterward called the Gazette de France. Appearing weekly as a sheet
folded into eight pages, it gave such official news as Richelieu
permitted or supplied, and it added some pages of nouvelles ordinaires.
Louis XIII was a frequent contributor; in the Gazette he answered the
critics of the government and defended his banishment of his mother;
sometimes he took his paragraphs in person to supervise their graduation
into type; even a Idng is fascinated when he finds himself in print.
From its beginning the French press was an agent of propaganda — in this
case a means of explaining to the literate minority the policies of the
state. The people soon distrusted the Gazette and bought, rather, the
scurrilous sheets sold on the streets by the pensioners of the
Cardinal’s foes.</p>
<p>The most widely read production of the age was a romance. The
chivalric romance was going out of fashion, not merely because Cervantes
and others ridiculed it, but because feudalism, now subordinated to
royalty, was losing more and more of its privileges and prestige. Tales
of when knighthood was in flower were replaced by agonizing romances of
impeded desire. Every possessor of letters and leisure under Louis XIII
read the Astree (1610-19) of Honore d’Urfe. The author’s genius grew
from a wound in love. His wife,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>417</p>
<p>well named Diana, preferred the venery of the hunt to the venery of
mar- riage; she had her dogs eat at table with her and share her bed.
She was delivered of an abortion annually.^24 Honore retired to his
estate and disguised his plaintive autobiography as a pastoral romance.
He found this cure by expression so satisfactory that he stretched it
out to 5,500 pages in five volumes issued at intervals from 1610 to
1627. In the story of the shepherd Celadon’s love for the shepherdess
Astree we hear an interminable echo of Montemayor’s Diana enamorada and
Sannazaro’s and Sidney’s Arcadias -, but the echo was melodious, the
shepherds and shepherdesses had all the grace and lace of the French
court, the language met all the demands of the Rambouillet Hotel, the
varieties of amorous exper ience rivaled Henry IV’s, and the adoration
of woman pleased the goddesses of the salons, who made the book a code
of manners for platonic love. Here was the gushing spring from which
streamed the sentimental romances of Mile, de Scudery, Abbe Prevost
(Antoine Prevost d’Exiles), Samuel Richardson, Jean Jacques Rousseau —
who professed to have read the book once a year through most of his
life. For nearly a century the lords and ladies of the French, German,
and Polish courts took the names and played the parts of U Astree; and
half the prose written in France cultivated romance.</p>
<p>The other half contained some memorable prose. Jean Louis Guez de
Balzac’s Lettres were really essays, designed to impress the precieusesy
sharing</p>
<p>with Vaugelas and Malherbe in purifying the language, and helping to
give French prose the form and logic of the classic age. . . . Pierre de
Bourdeilles de Brantome, after a gay life in the army and at the court,
left at his death (1614) a bundle of memoirs retailing with gusto the
amours of the French ladies, the virtues of Catherine de Medicis, the
beauty of Mary Stuart, and the wit of Marguerite of Valois; it is a pity
that his most fascinating stories are unverifi- able. “It is not good,”
he thought, “to grow old in t he same hole, and no man of spirit ever
did so; one must adventure boldly in all directions, in love as in war.”
In a more judicious moment he acknowledged that “the greatest bless -
ing God can grant us in our marriage is fair issue, not concubinage.” .
. . Jacques Auguste de Thou, magistrate and councilor of state under his
friend Henry IV, helped to draft and negotiate the Edict of Nantes, and
devoted half his life to writing Historia sui temporis (1604-8), or
History of His Ovm Timey a book distinguished by its scholarship, its
impartiality, and its courage in branding the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew as “an outburst of fury unex - ampled in the annals of
any nation.” . . . The Duke of Sully, in his old age and with the help
of secretaries, composed the famous Memoires des sages et royales
economies domestiquesy politiques, et militaires de Henri le Grandy
which he dedicated “to France, to all good soldiers, and to all the
French peo - ple.” … In the final year of Louis XIII a group of Flemish
Jesuits, led by Jean de Bolland, began to publish the Acta Sanctorumy
giving with cautious criticism the lives of the saints in the order of
their commemoration by the Catholic Church. Despite the vicissitudes of
the Society, the labor was zealously pursued, until in 1910 it ran to
sixty-five volumes. Some mythmongers pro-</p>
<p>4i8 the age of reason begins (chap. XVI</p>
<p>tested, but the work stands as a credit to the scholarship of the
most scholarly of religious orders. Finally, we must list again the
ubiquitous and incredible Richelieu, who dipped his pen into every
literary well and left us his Memoires — a bit prejudiced in favor of
the Cardinal, but standing high in that remark- able sequence of French
memoirs which has no rival in any other tongue.</p>
<p>Minor poets were never so plentiful. Th6ophile de Viau, Vincent
Voiture, and Honorat de Bueil, Marquis of Racan, are still read by loyal
Frenchmen, if only in school. Theophile’s libertine loves and scandalous
doubts made him the Villon of the age, condemned to the stake and then
let off with banishment. Voiture’s breezy wit made him the bel esprit
(we had almost dared to say the prime libber) of the Hotel de
Rambouillet. When Bossuet, aged twelve, preached at midnight in that
salon, Voiture said he had never heard a sermon delivered so early and
so late.</p>
<p>Two major poets honored these reigns. Francois de Malherbe
illustrated the principle that each age, to relish itself, must denounce
and reverse the past. The great Ronsard was still singing in Malherbe’s
youth; he and his Pleiade had chastened French verse by directing it to
classic models and themes; but their successors were now sonneteering
France and their mistresses to sleep with archaic terms, fanciful
phrases, Italian concetti, clumsy inversions, ob- scure allusions,
recondite mythology. Malherbe decided that there had been enough of
this. Born at Caen (1555), he studied at Basel and Heidelberg, spent
years in travel, and was already fifty when he reached the court of
France. Despite his impudences and impieties, he made his way and became
the favorite poet of Henry the Great, who, however, gave him “more com -
pliments than money.”^^® He lived by selling his verses to the highest b
idder, and he promoted his wares by eviscerating his predecessors. Like
the precieuses of the salon Rambouillet, he declared war on words that
smacked of rural coarseness or the less poetical operations of the human
bag; he banished in- versions, ambiguities, colloquialisms,
provincialisms, Gasconisms (which was hard on the King), padding,
cacophony, solecisms, importations, Latinisms, technicalities, poetic
license, imperfect rhymes. Now there should be dignity of ideas,
simplicity and clarity of expression, harmony of rhythm, consistency of
metaphors, order in exposition, logic in phrase. Good writing must
breathe well and must be welcome to the ear; hiatus (“a historian”) is
an auditory offense, a respiratory disease. Malherbe tried his verses o
n his butler’s ears.^^®</p>
<p>Let us breathe one of his poems — a “Consolation” addressed to a
friend who mourned the passing of a daughter:</p>
<p>Mais elle etait du monde, oil les plus belles choses</p>
<p>Ont le pire destin,</p>
<p>Et rose elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses,</p>
<p>Vespace d*un matin . . .</p>

<p>Malherbe’s practice was less effective than his principles; his
verses suffered a chill from his rules; and Guez de Balzac, who was at
this time reforming prose, saw only good prose in Malherbe’s poetry. But
the Hotel de Rambouillet took him to its bosoms, the Academy adopted his
precepts, and Boileau in- herited them as the foundation of the classic
style. They became for two cen- turies a stoic saintly shirt of hair and
mail for the lyric bards of France. In old age Malherbe swelled into a
very pontiff of poetry, an oracle on questions of language and style;
some of his admirer s saluted him as “the most eloquent man of all
time,” and he agreed that “what Malherbe writes will last eternally.”^28
Qj^ yg deathbed (1628), he roused himself from his final stupor to
reprove his nurse for using incorrect French.^^®</p>
<p>Mathurin Regnier thought him a bore, ignored his rules, and, like
Villon, sent up poetry steaming from the stews. Tonsured and destined
for the priest- hood, he so lost himself in Venusberg that he became old
and gray while young. At thirty-one he was infirm with gout and
syphilis. He still found that “every woman is to my taste,” but they
were more discriminating. He wrote</p>

<p>In 1609 he became court poet to Henry IV. Four years later, aged
thirty- nine, he died, worn out with melodious lechery. He had composed
his epitaph:</p>

<p>V. PIERRE CORNEILLE: 1606-84</p>
<p>The literary star in Richelieu’s firmament was Pierre Corneille, for
with him French drama became literature, and French literature, for a
century, became predominantly drama.</p>
<p>Many experiments had prepared for him. Ttienne Jodelle had staged the
first French tragedy in 1552. Similar imitations of Seneca followed, all
based on the Senecan scheme of tales of violence, psychological studies,
and bursts of rhetoric, shorn of the classic chorus, but cramped into
the supposedly Aristotelian unities of one action represented as
occurring in one place in one day’s lime. Aristotle (as we have seen in
discussing the Elizabethan drama) had required unity of action or plot;
he had not asked for unity of place, he had not insisted on unity of
time. But the Poetices libriseptem (1561) of the learned Julius Caesar
Scaliger required of all dramatists adherence to Greek and Latin forms;
Jean Chapelain repeated the demand in 1630; the arguments that in
England had fallen before the wild genius of a man who had small Latin
and less Greek won a com- plete victory in a France inheriting the Latin
language and culture; and after 1640 the Senecan form of three unities
held the French tragic stage through Corneille and Racine, through
Voltaire and the eighteenth cen- tury, through the Revolution, the
Empire, and the Restoration, till in Hugo’s Hernani (1830) the romantic
drama won its historic, tardy victory.</p>
<p>The French drama had no regular home in the sixteenth century, but
had to nurse itself in colleges and had to wander from court to court,
from hall to hall. In 1598 the first permanent French theater was
established at the Hotel de Bourgogne in the Rue Mauconseil, and in 1600
the Theatre des Marais was opened in the present Rue Vieille du Temple.
In both cases the form was a long central parterre, or pit, where the
less opulent classes stood, ate, drank, gambled, quarreled, and watched
the performance and their purses; while along the walls ran two tiers of
boxes, in which the</p>

<p>421</p>
<p>moneyed gentry sat. Before the reign of Richelieu only a few women
with nothing to lose attended the plays. The stage, raised at one end of
the rectangle, was so far from half the audience that the representation
of thought or feeling by facial expression was almost useless to the
actors, and a premium was placed upon rhetoric that could reach the
farthest ear. Performances were given in the afternoon, usually from
five to seven; the law required them to end before dark, for both
theaters were in dangerous quarters of the town. The actors, before
Moliere, were generally imported from Italy and Spain. Female parts were
taken by women, and in the comedies the need for revenue laid a bold
emphasis on sex. Church and Parlement tried in vain to cleanse or
suppress the comic theater. Richelieu raised the moral level of the
French drama by taking some of the dramatists under his patronage and
surveillance, by attending performances himself, and by collaborating
with Rotrou, Scarron, and others in the composition of plays. Gradually,
under his all-seeing eye, the predecessors of Corneille — Gamier, Hardy,
and Rotrou — prepared the way for the epochal success of Le Cid.</p>
<p>Corneille had the usual vicissitudes en route to mastery. Born in
Rouen (1606), he had the handicap of growing up in a provincial capital
distant from the literary stimulations and opportunities of Paris; but
his father was a distinguished magistrate able to give Pierre the best
available education in the local college of the Jesuits. These zealous
educators used drama as a tool of instruction; the students were taught
to act in Latin, classical and other plays, and this Jesuit practice
influenced the French drama in theme, technique and style. Of course no
one intended Pierre to become a drama- tist; he was trained for the law,
and he practiced it for a time; and the art and habit of forensic
eloquence may have shared in molding the oratory that resounds in his
tragedies.</p>
<p>At twenty-one, almost simultaneously, he fell into love and poetry:
the lady rejected him, and he found refuge in rhymes. Wounded into
lasting melancholy and timidity, he acted in ink the dramas forbidden to
his blood. Eleven years passed before he found a wife (1640) — and then
only through Richelieu’s aid; but meanwhile he conceived a dozen
tragedies or comedies of amorous or heroic gallantry. In 1629 he took to
Paris his first piece, Melite; it was performed at the Hotel de
Bourgogne; it was an absurd quadrangle of love and intrigue, but its
lively dialogue carried it to suc- cess, and Corneille warmed himself
before a blaze of fame. Richelieu en- gaged him, along with four others,
to write plays on topics and lines sug- gested by the Cardinal.
Corneille transformed too independently a sketch so submitted to him;
his Red Eminence frowned; Corneille withdrew in a huff to Rouen, but
continued to receive from Richelieu a pension of five hundred crowns a
year.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>Stirred and piqued by the success of Mairet’s tragedy Sophonisbe, he
abandoned comedy, studied Seneca, and took to Paris in 1635 his Me dee.
Here for the first time appeared his basic qualities — power of thought
and nobility of speech. Henceforth, with some lapses, he would people
his stage with men and women of high station, dower them with lofty
senti- ments, and express these in splendid language and forceful
reasoning. The contemporary English poet Waller, hearing Medee, hailed a
new master. “The others,” he said, “make . . . verses, but Corneille is
the only one who can think.”^“ — the highest art is art impregnated with
philosophy. From the heroic drama of Rome and Greece, from his Jesuit
teachers, from his own somber and solitary meditations — stately
Alexandrines marching in his dreams — Corneille achieved a plane of
thought and style never before known in French drama, and seldom
since.</p>
<p>There was another dramatic literature that drew and formed him. He
could derive little from the Elizabethan stage, for that was too
negligent of classic rules to fit a classic mold. But Spain, in this
age, was mad with theater, showering honors upon Lope de Vega and Tirso
de Molina and Calderon de la Barca as the only worthy heirs of Sophocles
and Euripides, Terence and Seneca. And in the Spanish drama Corneille
found a naturally dramatic theme — that code of honor which required a
death for every in sult or seduction. He learned Spanish, read Guillen
de Castro’s Las</p>
<p>mocedades del Cid (1599?), borrowed the plot with no more apology
than Shakespeare, and wrote the most famous play in French
literature.^</p>
<p>Le Cid was performed in 1636. The audience felt that nothing so
power- ful as this had yet appeared on Gallic boards. “It is so fine,”
said a con - temporary, “that it has inspired even the coldest ladies
with love, so that their passion has sometimes broken out in the public
theater. People have been seen in the boxes who seldom leave their
gilded halls and fleur-de-lis- covered armchairs.”<em>®</em> Not many
knew that the plot had been borrowed, though Corneille frankly confessed
it; all marveled at its entangled sub- tlety. Highborn Chimene and noble
Rodrigue are tremblingly in love. But Chim^ne’s father, Don Gomes,
quarrels with and insults Rodrigue’s old and ailing father, Don Diegue.
Rodrigue feels bound in honor to avenge his father; he challenges Gomes
and kills him. Chimene, still loving Rodrigue, feels bound in honor to
beg King Fernand to behead or banish him; the conflict in her between
the “point of honor” and the call of the mate gives the story and her
divergent passions an extraordinary force and in- tensity. Rodrigue
offers Chimene his sword and invites her to kill him, but she cannot
make up her mind. He goes off to fight the Moors, returns to Seville
trailing captured kings and clouds of glory; all Seville sings his</p>
<p>• El Cid (i.e., Sayyid, noble) was the title given by the Moors to
Rodrigo Diaz, the half - legendary hero who shared (c. 1085) in
restoring Spain to Christ.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>name, but Chimene still demands his death. As Fernand refuses, she
pledges her hand to anyone who will challenge and kill the man she
loves. Sancho takes the task. Rodrigue proposes to let Sancho kill him.
Chimene repents of her revenge, begs him to defend himself; he overcomes
Sancho, but spares him; at last the code of honor is satisfied; Chimene
accepts her lover, and all is well.</p>
<p>For half a season Paris celebrated the beauty and debated the sanity
of Chimene. Political overtones were heard. Richelieu had forbidden
duels, and in this play duels seemed part of the highest law. The
nobles, hating Richelieu, gloried in the representation of an
aristocracy that still took the law into its own hands. Nor was the
Cardinal quite pleased with the success of one who had balked at
receiving his literary directives. He asked his newborn Academy to issue
a judicial critique of the play, and hardly con- cealed his hope that
the judgment would be adverse. The Academy pro- longed its discussions
to let tempers cool; finally, after five months, it published its
“Sentiments.” All in all, the verdict was moderate and just. It objected
to the apparent exaltation of romantic love, it thought the denouement
lacking in verisimilitude, and it saw something indecent and absurdly
vain in Chimene’s final words to Rodrigue as he went to fight Sancho,
“Sors vainqueur d’un combat dont Chimene est le prix” (Come victor from
a combat of which Chimene is the prize). This criticism was handsomely
salved with the Academy’s conclusion</p>
<p>that even learned men must grant some indulgence to the
irregularities of a work which would not have had the good fortune to
please the community so much if it had not possessed uncommon beauties .
. . and that the naturalness and vehemence of its passions, the force
and delicacy of many of its thoughts, and the indescribable charm which
mingles with all of its defects, have gained for it a high rank
among</p>
<p>French poems of the same character.^*^</p>
<p>The Academy never again assumed the office of literary judge.
Corneille eased the situation by dedicating the published Cid to the
Cardinal’s be - loved niece, and to the Cardinal himself his next
masterpiece, Horace (1640). Livy‘S® had told the legend in his History.
On the same day, in separate cities, twin sisters gave birth to male
triplets — one set fathered by Horatius at Rome, the other by Curiatus
at Alba Longa. A generation later the two families were further allied
by the marriage of Sabina, daughter of Curiatus, to Horace, a son of
Horatius, and by the love of Camilla, daughter of Horatius, for one of
the Curiati triplets. But then the two cities stumble into war; their
armies come face to face; Sabina and Camilla tremble in the Roman camp,
and Sabina sets the feminine theme of the composition:</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>424</p>
<p>Je suis Romainej helas! puisque Horace est Romain;</p>
<p>fen ai regu le titre en recevant sa main;</p>

<p>Mes trois jreres dans Tune, et mon mari dans V autre,</p>
<p>Fuis-je jormer des voeux, et sans impiete</p>
<p>Importuner le del pour ta felicite?*^^^</p>
<p>So Corneille displays as his subject no mere battle of arms and men,
but the conflict of passionate loyalties, the tragedy of right
contending with right; and thus inspired, his pen strikes off phrases of
compact power, and lines that march with martial step and resounding
harmonies.</p>
<p>The Alban commander reminds the Romans that they and the Albans (did
Corneille have Catholics and Huguenots in mind?) are of one blood and
land, and that it is criminal to dismember Italy (France?) with civil
strife; and he proposes to settle the war by a combat of three Albans
and three Romans. The offer is accepted, and the women have an hour of
fearful happiness. But the Alban chief chooses the Curiati triplets, the
Roman chooses the Horatii. The women mourn, and the heroes are for a
moment softened by their tears; but Horatius the father, sounding the
masculine theme, reproves them for wasting time with women while honor
calls:</p>
<p>Fakes votre devoir, et laissez faire aux dieux.</p>
<p>Do your duty, and leave the rest to the gods.^^*^</p>
<p>The gods fumble. The three Curiati are slain; Horace alone of the
Horatii survives. His sister, Camilla, reproves him for killing her
betrothed and denounces Rome and its code of honor and war. Still drunk
with battle, he slays her as unworthy to be a Roman. His wife, Sabina,
upbraids his cruelty.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I am a Roman, alas, since Horace is a Roman; I took that title in
receiving his hand; but this bond would hold me a chained slave if it
closed my eyes to the place of my birth. Alba, where I first breathed
the day. Alba, my dear land and my first love, when I see war declared
between you and ourselves, I dread our victory as much as our defeat.
If, Rome, you complain that this is to betray you, give yourself such
foes as I may hate. When I see from your walls their army and ours, my
three brothers in the one and my husband in the other, how can I form my
prayers and, without impiety, importune Heaven for your felicity?”</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS 425</p>
<p>laments her lost brothers, and invites Horace to kill her too. He
tries to persuade her that patriotism is higher than love.</p>
<p>The plot, of course, is incredible, but hardly more so than in
Shakespeare. The dramatic is by definition exceptional; dramas would be
ruined if they impartially described reality; they rise to art if, by
ignoring the irrelevant and selecting the significant, they can deepen
us with a fuller understand- ing of life. Corneille inherited the
Renaissance exaltation of ancient Rome; he upheld the stoic conception
of duty against those laxities of love that had dominated the French
stage before him; his heroes were to be not lovers primarily, but
patriots or saints.</p>
<p>He took a saint from the Catholic calendar to dominate a still
stronger play. “All the world knows Polyeucte, knows it by heart,” said
Sainte - Beuve.^®® Here the construction is severely classical,
accepting all the unities, yet building within them a complex tragedy of
concentrated power. Only the eloquence of the play reaches us in our
studies today; we must hear it rolling from the tongues of French actors
moving in stately figures over the stage, or under the stars in the
court of the Invalides or the Louvre; and even then we must have the
French language and French souls, and we must reclothe ourselves in our
youthful faith. The plot centers around the resolve of Polyeucte, a
proud and cultured Roman newly converted to Christianity, to smash the
altar of the pagan gods. The time is the Decian persecution (249-51
a.d.); the place is Melitene, a Roman outpost in Armenia; the scene of
the entire drama is the palace of Felix, the Roman governor. All
Christians, on pain of death, have been ordered to join in an
Empire-wide prayer and sacrifice to the ancient deities for divine
support of Roman arms against the invading, encompassing barbarians.
Burning with a convert’s zeal, Polyeucte desires by some dramatic action
to en - courage Christian resistance to the Imperial edict. He is held
back by love for his wife, Pauline, daughter of the governor, but, like
a true Corneillean hero, he sacrifices love to duty. In the presence of
Felix himself he and a friend interrupt the pagan rites; they appeal to
the worshipers to turn from the adulterous Jupiter to the God of the
Christians, the one and “absolute monarch of earth and sky”; and to
expose the “impotent mon - sters” of the Roman pantheon they mount t he
altar and dash to the ground the ritual vessels and the statue of Jove.
Felix has the violators arrested. Pauline pleads with Polyeucte to
repent his sacrilege; instead, he challenges her to join in his new
faith. She appeals to her father to pardon him; he refuses; she
announces her conversion and prepares to accompany her hus- band to
death. Felix is so impressed that he resigns his office and becomes a
Christian. Suddenly the persecution ends; Felix is reappointed, but
mean- while Polyeucte has suffered martyrdom.</p>
<p>All but the martyrdom and the desecration of the altar is
Corneille’s</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>embellishment of history; his, too, are the proud insolence of the
saint and the violence of the deed. When the author read the play at the
Hotel de Rambouillet, several auditors, including a bishop, condemned
Polyeucte as unnecessarily harsh and extreme. Corneille for a time
thought of sup- pressing the play. Its success on the stage brought him
to the zenith of his career (1643). He still had forty-one years of life
left him, which we</p>
<p>shall see him spending in rivalry with Racine; but he could not know
that he had already written his three greatest plays — some would say
the best in all the history of the French stage. They are so different
from the</p>
<p>“romantic” drama of Elizabethan England or nineteenth -century France
that imagination must aid history to explain their hold upon their time
and the theater today. There is romance too in Corneille, as much as in
Shake- speare, and passions studied with more than the care and
subtletly of Des- cartes; but, following the classic ideals of the age,
the passions; though vigorously expressed, are subjected to “reason” —
or to argument. Super- abundance of argument is the ballast of these
plays, so that they rarely reach the flights so numerous in Racine.
Action is kept off the boards; there all is narration, exhortation,
eloquence; in Corneille every character is an accomplished raisonneur.
For Frenchmen these faults disappear in the splendor of the style and
the majesty of the themes. If, in any work of art, we seek nobility,
some thought or feeling to lift us above ourselves and the day, we shall
find it frequently in Corneille. He wrote as if for statesmen and
philosophers; he molded his lines as if composing music; he carved
phrases that still haunt the memory of France. Now the classic and
aristocratic spirit — of reason checking passion, of form dominating
matter — ^merged with Stoic self-control, Spanish honor, and French
intelligence to produce a theater all the world apart from the
Elizabethan, and yet, with Racine and Moliere, as precious and brilliant
in the legacy of mankind.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ARCHITECTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Was the victory of the classic mood visible in art as well as
literature? It stares at us in almost every French fagade of the age.
Some Gothic churches were Gothically restored, like the cathedral at
Orleans; but more often old churches — like those of St.-Gervaise and
St.-£tienne-du- Mont — were refurnished with Renaissance fronts. New
churches might show a neo-Italian style throughout; so Jacques Lemercier
designed the Church of the Sorbonne on the model of St . Peter’s —
columns, pediment, and dome. In architecture, as in morals, letters, and
philosophy, the pagan revival gave a bold new face to Christianity.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>Even the Jesuits were caught in the Renaissance current, all the more
readily since, as an order, they had no binding medieval roots. In their
first generations, under Loyola and Laynez, they had been austere and
fearless missionaries, devoted defenders of orthodoxy and the popes; but
they had saved some measure of humanism at the Council of Trent; and as
in their colleges they made the ancient classics the core of their
curriculum, so in architecture they chose semiclassic fagades for their
outstanding shrines. From their brilliant church in Rome, the Gesu, they
carried their style of luxuriant decoration across the Alps and over the
Pyrenees. They were not uniformly pledged to copious ornament; their
most famous archi- tect — ^who raised the transept fagade of the Orleans
cathedral — designed churches and colleges on lines of severe simplicity
congenial to his character and his funds. But when the order prospered
it built with a happy exuber- ance. In 1627 it began the handsome church
familiarly known to Paris as Les Jesuites — the fa9ade Roman, the
interior exquisitely carved in capitals, arches, and cornices, the choir
vaults meeting harmoniously to support a luminous dome; John Evelyn,
touring Paris in 1644, called this church “one of the most perfect
pieces of architecture in Europe.”^®® It was not unpleasantly baroque;
it contained nothing distorted or bizarre. In France baroque was sobered
by aristocratic taste — as Ronsard and Malherbe chas- tened the
enormities of Rabelais.</p>
<p>Religious architecture languished during the Religious Wars, and in
the intervals of peace civil architecture grew. City halls rose at La
Rochelle, Lyon, Troyes, and Reims. In Paris Catherine de Medicis,
wishing to</p>
<p>leave the Louvre to Charles IX and his Queen, hired Philibert Delorme
to build for her and her aides the Tuileries (1564), which took its name
from the tile {mile) potteries nearby. The new palace, fronted in
Renais- sance style with Corinthian pillars, rose west of the Louvre at
the present Place du Carrousel, and ran for 807 feet along the Seine. It
was burned down in the fury of the Commune in 1871; only the gardens
remain — the delectable Jardins des Tuileries.</p>
<p>Civic building recovered rapidly under Henry IV. The Pont Neuf,</p>
<p>opened to traffic in 1 604, became the most popular of the bridges
spanning the Seine. The Hotel de Ville, finished in Henry’s dying year,
remained till 1871 the rival of Notre Dame and the Louvre in the pride
of the</p>
<p>people. Like Francis I and Louis XIV, Henry gathered artists under
his wing, understood them, and co-ordinated their work. For him they ex-
tended the Louvre by the Pavilion de Flore and connected it with the
Tuileries by the Grande Galerie. At Fontainebleau they built the chapel,
the Galerie des Cerfs, the Cour and Salon Ovale, the Porte Dauphine, and
the Galerie de Diane. Fontainebleau under Henri le Grand was the ful-
fillment of the French Renaissance.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>His widow, Marie de Medicis, before running afoul of Richelieu,
en-</p>
<p>gaged Salomon de Brosse to design her own Palais du Luxembourg, in
the Rue Vaugirard south of the Seine (1613-20). When Louis XIII and</p>
<p>Richelieu freed themselves from her they commissioned Lemercier to
again extend the Louvre as the seat of government; now the Pavilion de
I’Horloge was completed, the great wings were extended, and the lordly
building took essentially its present form. From Lemercier’s plans Riche
- lieu built in Paris the sumptuous Palais Cardinal, into which he
gathered his collections of painting, sculpture, and other arts; here
were Mantegnas, da Vincis, Veroneses, and Michelangelo’s Slaves. Most of
this treasure passed to Louis XIII and XIV, to the Louvre, and to
us.</p>
<p>In domestic architecture Fran9ois Mansart reshaped the skyline of
Paris by developing the mansard roof — having two slopes, the lower one
steeper than the other, readily shedding snow and rain, and allowing
greater space in the top floor; many a Paris student or artist has lived
in a mansarde or attic room. Mansart designed several churches in Paris,
and many chateaux in France — most successfully at what is now Maisons
LafHtte, a suburb of the capital. In 1635 “Monsieur” Gaston d’Orleans
commissioned him to rebuild the family chateau at Blois; Mansart
finished only the northwest wing; its Renaissance fagade and magnificent
stairway remain the chef- d’oeuvre of “the most skillful architect
France has ever produced.”^^®</p>
<p>vn. many arts</p>
<p>In the same mood of classic tradition softened by French refinement
and feeling, the sculptors adorned the churches, mansions, gardens, and
tombs of the great. Germain Pilon inherited the Renaissance grace of
Cellini, Primaticcio, and Jean Goujon, but he remembered too the Gothic
merger of tenderness and strength. His masterpieces are three tombs.
One, in the abbey church of St.- Denis, reunited in death Catherine de
Medicis and her occasional husband Henry II — the Queen dowered with an
idealized beauty that would have warmed her solitary heart. Another, now
in the Louvre, honored Rene de Birague, Chancellor to Francis II and
Charles IX — a picture of pride humbled to piety, a marvel of pliant
drapery cau ght in bronze. Beside this is the tomb of Ren6’s wife,
Valentine Balbiani: above, the lady in her prime, glorified with figured
robes; below, the same beauty ruthlessly carved as a corpse, with bony
face, hands, and legs, corrugated chest, and sunken empty breasts; this
is a powerful outcry of anger against time’s sardonic desecration of
loveliness. These tombs alone would have raised Pilon above any other
French sculptor of the age; but he added to them an abundance of
statuary, all of arresting merit, and now mostly gathered into France’s
inexhaustible treasury, the Louvre.</p>
<p>There, too, within a few paces, one may see works of Pilon’s
successors: a life figure of Heruy IV by Barthelemy Tremblay, with a
smile as puzzling as</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS 429</p>
<p>Mona Lisa’s; the tomb of Anne de Montmorency by Barthelemy Prieur;
and a lively Renommee (Tame) by Pierre Briard — a nude blowing from
puffed cheeks and writing in the air, as if to say, improving on Keats,
’’Here lies one whose nam e was writ in wind.” In the chapel at
Chantilly is a memorable monument to Cardinal de Berulle by Jacques
Sarazin. Some of these sculptors studied in Rome and brought back from
Bernini a baroque tendency to exces- sive ornament, movement, and
emotion, but these excesses soon vanished under the cold eye of
Richelieu and the classic taste of Louis XIV. The smooth per- fection of
le grand siecle already appears in the medallions of Jean Varin, who
came from Liege to live in France, and who reached, in his minuscule
portraits of Richelieu, Mazarin, and Anne of Austria, an excellence no
later medalist has ever surpassed.</p>
<p>If France had left us no sculpture, architecture, or painting she
would still command our loving homage for her achievements in the lesser
arts. Even in this harassed interval between Francis I and Louis XIV,
the drawings, engrav- ings, enamels, goldsmithery, gem cutting,
ironwork, woodwork, textiles, tap- estries, and garden designs of France
rivaled — some would say surpassed — the like products of her
contemporaries from Flanders to Italy. Jacques Callot’s drawings of
gypsies, beggars, and tramps carry the very odor of life, and his series
of etchings The Miseries of War stole a march of two centuries on Goya.
Let the iron artistry of the age be judged from the grille leading to
the Galerie d’ Apollon in the Louvre. Tapestry was as much a major art
as sculpture or painting. Jean Gobelin had opened dye works in Paris in
the fifteenth cen- tury; in the sixteenth the firm added a tapestry
factory; Francis I established another at Fontainebleau, Henry II a
third in the capital. When Catherine de Medicis went to meet the Spanish
envoys at Bayonne she took with her twenty-two tapestries woven for
Francis I to display the wealth and art of France. The art-craft
declined under Henry II, but Henri Quatre restored it by bringing a new
generation of Flemish designers, dyers, and weavers to the Gobelin plant
in Paris. Five distinguished specimens from his reign — The Hunt of
Diana — adorn the Morgan Library in New York.</p>
<p>Interior decoration felt the baroque influence seeping in from Italy.
Chairs, tables, chests, buffets, cabinets, dressers, bedsteads were
curved and carved luxuriantly, often inlaid with ebony, lapis lazuli,
jasper or agate, or adorned with statuettes. In the Louis Treize period
many chairs were upholstered in velvet, needlework, or tapestry. Walls,
cornices, and ceilings might be carved or painted with a frolic of plant
or animal forms. Fireplaces lost some of their medieval ruggedness, and
were sometimes embellished with delicate arabesques in polychrome.</p>
<p>In pottery it was the heyday of two old men: Leonard Limousin, who
continued till 1574 to produce such enamels as had made him famous under
Francis I,* and Bernard Palissy, who, born in 1510, survived till 1589.
Palissy was a man mad about pottery, with a passionate curiosity
spilling</p>

<p>over into agriculture, chemistry, and religion, interested in
everything from the formation of stones to the nature of deity. He
studied the chemistry of diverse soils to get the best clay for his
kiln, and he experimented for years to produce a white enamel that would
take and hold delicate hues. He burned half his belongings to feed his
ceramic furnace, and told the story as if challenging Cellini. Too poor
to hire help, he did all the work himself; he cut his hands so
frequently that, he said, “I was forced to eat my soup with my hands
bound up in rags.” And: “After working like</p>
<p>this for ten years, I was so thin that no muscles appeared on my arms
or legs; my legs were so thin that the garters with which I hold up my
stockings 〔no longer held them〕 . . . When I walked my stockings fell
to my ragged shoes. His neighbors accused him of practicing magic and
neglecting his family. Finally, about 1550, he found the mixture he
sought, made an enamel of iridescent glaze, and used it to fashion
vessels and figur- ines brilliantly adorned with fishes, lizards,
snakes, insects, birds, stones — all the plethora of nature. Catherine
de Medicis delighted to place these artificial fossils in her garden and
flower beds; she gave the old potter a workshop in the Tuileries, and in
his new environment he added naiads and nymphs to his decorations.
Though a zealous Huguenot, he was ex- empted from the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew, for Catherine and her court were fascinated by his
vases, cups, plates, candlesticks, and quaint ideas. But in 1588 the
Catholic League ordered a new prosecution of Protestants, and Palissy
was sent to the Bastille. A diarist wrote in 1590:</p>
<p>In this year 〔actually in 1589〕 there died in the dungeons of
the</p>
<p>fiasdlle Maitre Bernard Palissy, a prisoner on account of his
religion, aged eighty years; he succumbed to misery, ill-treatment, and
want.</p>
<p>. . . The aunt of this good man having gone to inquire how he
was,</p>

him to be thrown like the dog that he was.^^®</p>

<li>POUSSIN AND THE PAINTERS</li>
</ol>
<p>French painting was still in bondage to Flanders and Italy.
Flemish</p>
<p>tapissiers dominated their art in Paris, and Flemish painters
prospered in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Montpellier, and Bordeaux. The best
French</p>
<p>portraits of this period were by Flemings in France: the lovely
Elizabeth of Austria (now in the Louvre) by Fran9ois Clouet, the proud
Henry IV (in Chantilly) by Frans Pourbus the Younger, and, above all,
the Riche- lieu of Philippe de Champaigne.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>But the mastering influence on French painting in this period was
Italian. Art students went to Rome, sometimes at the French government’s
ex - pense, and came back hesitating between the idealism of the
sixteenth-cen- tury Florentines and the dark realism of the
seventeenth-century Bolognese or Neapolitans. Simon Vouet, from the age
of fourteen (1604), made such a name for himself as a painter that three
countries competed for him. Charles I tried to keep him in London, but
the Baron of Sancy took him on an embassy to Constantinople, where Simon
made a remarkable likeness of Ahmet I from a secret study of the
Sultan’s features in an hour’s audi - ence given to the ambassador.
Returning through Italy, Vouet fell in love with Venice and Veronese,
then with Caravaggio in Rome, whose dukes and cardinals so favored him
that he remained in Italy fifteen years. In 1627 Louis XIII, who had
been paying him an annual pension of four thousand livres, summoned him
to France to be court painter, and gave him an apartment in the Louvre.
Soon all France wanted him. He decorated the chapel of Richelieu’s
chateau, made an altarpiece for the Church of St.-Eustache, furnished
designs for royal tapestries, and painted portraits for the court.
Buried in commissions, he gathered aides into a school which grew into
the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture; there he trained and
employed Le Sueur, Mignard, Le Notre, Bourdon, and Le Brun. His
surviving works hardly vindicate his fame, but he has in French history
the pivotal place of preparing the painters of the culminating age.</p>
<p>Three brothers, Antoine, Louis, and Mathieu Le Nain, varied the can-
vases of their time by picturing the life of the peasants with somber
pity, finding in them the silent poverty and grim strength of
seventeenth-cen- tury France. Georges de La Tour (recently exhumed by
critical acclaim) also gave his brush to the lowly; his matching
portraits A Feasant Man and A Feasant Woman stand near the top of
paintings in these reigns; we may judge his current reclame by the
00,000 or more paid for his Fortuneteller by the New York Metropolitan
Museum of Art (i960).</p>
<p>Akin to this turning from court to cottage was the specific
achievement of French painting in this age — the development of
landscape as a major element in pictorial art.</p>
<p>The father of Nicolas Poussin was a soldier in the army of Henry
IV.</p>
<p>Quartered in the home of Nicolas Delaisement after the battle of
Ivry, he married Nicolas’ daughter — a peasant woman who could not write
her name — and tilled a farm near Les Andelys in Normandy. Their son
learned to love fields and woods, and to catch some moment of them with
pencil or pen. Quentin Varin came to Les Andelys to decorate a church;
young Nicolas watched him eagerly and coaxed lessons from him in drawing
and painting. When Varin departed, Nicolas, aged eighteen (1612), ran
away to Paris to study art. There his months of near-starvation were
glorified by</p>
<p>432 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>finding Raimondi’s engravings of Raphael’s works. Here were two reve
- lations for Nicolas: that line, not color, was the tool of art, and
that Rome was art’s capital. For ei ght struggling years he tried to
reach that citadel. Once he got as far as Florence, but, penniless,
despondent, and ill, he returned to Paris. He tried again, but was
stopped at Lyon by a creditor; he crept back to pay his debts and butter
his bread by some minor painting in the Luxembourg Palace. In 1 62 2 the
Italian poet Giovanni Battista Marini, coming to Paris, employed him to
illustrate the poem Adone. Poussin’s drawings won Marini’s approval, and
some commissions. Nicolas painted portraits grudgingly and saved his
francs reverently, and in 1624 he at last saw Rome.</p>
<p>Marini recommended him to Cardinal Francesco Barberini: “You will
find here a youth who has demonic fury in him” — a young man “mad about
painting” (to vary Hiroshige’s self -analysis). He was mad about Italy
too, but not so much about the paintings of the Renaissance masters as
about the perfection of fragments in the Roman Forum, and not about the
frescoes surviving from antiquity but about Rome herself — her vistas,
fields, trees, hills, her very soil. Like some later enthusiasts, he
must have wondered why God had not let him be born in Italy.</p>
<p>Cardinal Barberini tested him with a commission to paint The Death of
Germanicus; the result pleased, and soon Poussin had all he could do to
meet the calls on his art. His patrons, lay or churchly, yearned for
nudes; and for a time he appeased them with such feminine displays as
The Triumph of Flora* for Cardinal Omodeo, and A Bacchanalian Scene for
Richelieu. He settled down in Rome, married at thirty-six a girl of
seven- teen, and spent ten years of happiness with her and his oils.
Then (1640) Richelieu and Louis XIII summoned him to Paris. “I shall
go,” said Poussin , “like one sentenced to be savm in half.”^^® He was
given high honors and a pension of a thousand crowns, but he was ill at
ease in the rancorous com- petition of the Parisian artists.
Surrendering rich prospects, he hurried back to Italy (1643). He bought
a house on the Pincian Hill, next to Claude Lorrain’s, and there he
remained till his death, quiet, domestic, absorbed, content.</p>
<p>His life, like his pictures, was a classic composition, a model of
order, measure, and self-restraint. He had few marks of the artist
except his tools; he was not an avid lover like Raphael, nor a man of
the world like Titian, nor (despite Marini) a demonic genius like
Michelangelo; he was a bourgeois who took care of his family and paid
his debts. Cardinal Mas- sim o, seeing his modest establishment,
remarked, “How I pity you for hav - ing no servant!” — to which Poussin
replied, “How I pity you for having so many!”^^^ Every morning he walked
on his hill; then all day he painted,</p>

<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>

<p>relying on labor rather than inspiration. When, later, someone asked
him how he had reached mastery, he answered, “I neglected nothing.”^^®
Considering his laborious and unaided methods, his production was im-
mense. He must have painted four hundred pictures, for we know that some
were lost, and 342 remain; add thirteen hundred drawings, of which
Windsor Castle cherishes a hundred for their precision and purity of
line. He did not excel in variety. Often his nudes are lifeless statues;
we should have relished more sensuality. He was a sculptor using a
brush; he tended to look upon women as sculptural figures — though at
times he recognized them as the divine originals of art. “The pretty
girls whom we see in the streets of Nimes,” he said, “please our eyes
and souls no less than the lovely columns of the Maison Carr6, since
these are only old copies of those.”^^® Nor was he at home in Biblical
subjects. Some he did well — • The Philistine Struck Down at the Gates,
and The Blind Men of Jericho; and how lovely, yet stately, are the women
in Eliezer and Rebecca! His forte was classical mythology pictured amid
classical ruins against a land- scape of classic calm. He drew not from
living models but from an im- agination steeped in the love and illusion
of an antiquity in which all men were strong and all women beautiful.
See the perfection of the one female figure in The Shepherds of Arcady,
which Poussin, on Colbert’s order, painted for Louis XIV. And note, in
passing, the inscription on the shep- herd’s tomb: Et ego in Arcadia —
“I too 〔was once〕 in Arcadia”; was this Poussin dreaming that he too
had lived in Greece with Orpheus and the gods?</p>
<p>The Funeral of Phocion is the most powerful of Poussin’s mythologies,
but Orpheus and Eurydict is the most moving, perhaps because we recall
Gluck’s despairing strains. The romantic soul is disturbed to find the
story so lost in the landscape. For in truth it was not man that Poussin
loved, nor woman either, it was the chastening expanse of fields, woods,
and sky — all that encompassing panorama in which change is leisurely or
shamed by permanence, and human ills are swallowed up in the perspec-
tives of space and time. Therefore his greatest pictures are landscapes,
in which man is as minor an incident as in Chinese painting or modem
biology.</p>
<p>These landscapes are majestic, but monotonous. We should hardly dis-
tinguish one from another if Poussin had not thrown in some identifying
figures or a careless title. He loved line wisely but too well; he
neglected the gamut of color, playing too much on brown; no wonder later
artists</p>
<p>have rebelled against thi s “brown sauce” dripping from his trees.
And yet those softly lighted, softly colored vistas, so unsatisfying to
a Ruskin fas cinated by Turner’s glare,^^^ are a relief after the
ideological fermentation</p>
<p>434</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>harmony of parts in a whole, not the youthful idea of art as
“expression” — which might be a child’s daub or a hawker’s cry. Amid
mannerism and baroque, and against the force and sentiment of Italian
painting in the seventeenth century, Poussin clung to the classic ideal
of nothing in excess: no shouting colors, no tears, no bizarreries, no
theatrical contrasts of light and shade. It is a masculine art,
resembling Corneille rather than Racine, and Bach more than
Beethoven.</p>
<p>The self-portrait that he made in 1 650 shows his eyes a bit weary,
per- haps with painting or reading by scant light. He read much, seeking
to know the life of ancient Greece and Rome in sedulous detail; not
since Leonardo had an artist been so learned. As he entered old age he
found his eyes weakening, his hand unsteady. The death of his wife at
fifty-one ( 1 664) cut a living bond; he survived her but a year.
“Apelles is dead,” wrote a friend. On or near the tomb in the parish
church of San Lorenzo, Chateaubriand (1829) raised a marble monument as
one mortal immortal to another:</p>
<p>F. A. de CMteaubriand</p>
<p>d</p>
<p>Nicolas Poussin</p>
<p>Pour la gloire des arts et Phonneur de la France</p>
<p>His closest rival as a landscape painter was his neighbor but
friend,</p>
<p>Claude Gellee, named Lorrain from the province of his birth. He too
felt the urge to Italy, accepting any position, however menial, to get
there and live there, where every turn of the seeking eye revealed some
monument of Christian art or some inspiring fragment of antiquity. In
Rome he</p>
<p>apprenticed himself to Agostino Tassi, mixed colors for him, cooked
for him, learned from him. He made a thousand tentative drawings, and
etch- ings now prized by connoisseurs. He worked slowly and
scrupulously, sometimes a fortnight over one detail. At last he too was
a painter, fed with commissions from appreciative cardinals and kings.
Soon he had his own home on the Pincian Hill, and he shared with Poussin
in meeting the new demand for natural scenes.</p>
<p>He responded willingly, for he loved the land and sky of Rome so pas-
sionately that often he rose before dawn to watch the daily creation of
light, to catch the stealthy changes of light and shade made by each
emerging inch of the sun. Light was to Claude no mere element in a
picture; it was his major subject; and though he did not care, like
Turner, to look into the very face of the sun, he was the first to study
and convey the spreading integument of fight. He grasped the intangible
play of air upon fields, foli- age, water, clouds; every moment of the
sky was new, and he seemed bent</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>FRANCE BENEATH THE WARS</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>on having each fluid moment still itself in his art. He loved the
tremor of sails meeting the wind, the majesty of ships riding the sea.
He felt the lure of distance, the logic and magic of perspective, the
longing to see, be- yond the visible, the infinity of space.</p>
<p>Landscapes were his only interest. On Poussin’s advice he inserted
clas - sical structures — temples, ruins, pedestals — into his pictures,
perhaps to give the dignity of old age to a passing scene. He consented
to add some human figures to Nature’s panorama, but his heart was not in
these ex - crescences. The figures “were thrown in for nothing”; he
“sold his land - scapes and gave away his figures.”^^® The titles and
the stories they sug - gested were concessions to minds that could not
feel the miracle of light and the mystery of space without the grace of
Christian legend or some tag of classical tales. But in reality there
was for Claude only one theme — the world of morning, noon, and
eventide. He dowered the galleries of Europe with fond variations, whose
names mean nothing, but whose pantheism is a mystic marriage of poetry
and philosophy.</p>
<p>We may admit to Ruskin^^® that Claude and Poussin show Nature de-
ceptively in her gentler moods, missing her grandeur and ignoring her
furies of pitiless destructiveness. But through their work a great
tradition of landscape painting had been established. Now more and more
this would compete with figures and portraits, with Biblical and
mythical scenes. The way was opened for Nature’s procession from the
Ruisdaels to Corot.</p>
<p>Richelieu and national unity, Corneille and the Academy, Montaigne
and Malherbe, de Brosse and Mansart, Poussin and Lorrain — this was no
scanty harvest from a land at war. Louis XIV would now stand on that
rising heritage and preside over France in her greatest age.</p>
