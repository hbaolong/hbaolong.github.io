<p>1805-32</p>
<p>I. GOETHE AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>S HALL we, honoring our stated limits, leave Goethe suspended at this
point, with Faust on his pen and wisdom in his age, or shall we, burden-
ing space and risking time, pursue this ever-evolving Olympian to his
end? Die ewige W eisheit zieht uns hinan: timeless wisdom draws us on.
1</p>
<p>On October 14, 1806, Napoleon defeated the Prussians at Jena. Duke
Karl August, allied with Prussia, had led his own little army against
the French in that battle. The routed survivors, and then the hungry
victors, entered Weimar, sacked the stores, and quartered themselves in
private homes. Six- teen Alsatian troops took over Goethe’s house;
Christiane gave them food, drink, and beds. That night two other
soldiers, intoxicated, forced their way in, and, finding no more beds
available on the lower floor, ran upstairs into Goethe’s room,
brandished their swords in his face, and demanded accom - modations.
Christiane placed herself between these soldiers and her mate, persuaded
them to leave, and then bolted the door. On the fifteenth Bona- parte
reac hed Weimar and restored order; instructions were issued that “the
distinguished scholar” was not to be disturbed, and that “all measures
should be taken to protect the great Goethe and his home.” 2 Marshals
Lannes, Ney, and Augereau stayed with him for a while, and then left
with apologies and compliments. Goethe thanked Christiane for her
bravery, and said to her, “God willing, we shall be man and wife.” On
October 19 they were mar - ried. His good mother, who had borne lovingly
with all his faults, and mod- estly with all his honors, sent them
renewed blessings. She died on Septem- ber 12, 1808, and Goethe
inherited half of her estate.</p>
<p>In October, 1 808, Napoleon presided over a meeting of six sovereigns
and forty-three princes at Erfurt, and remade the map of Germany. Duke
Karl August attended, taking Goethe in his retinue. Bonaparte asked
Goethe to visit him on October 2; the poet came, and spent an hour with
the con- queror, Talleyrand, two generals, and Friedrich von Muller, a
Weimar mag- istrate. Napoleon complimented him on his vigor (Goethe was
then fifty- nine), inquired about his family, and launched into a
spirited critique of Werther. He condemned current dramas that
emphasized fate. “Why talk about fate? Politics are fate…. Qu’en dit
Monsieur Goet? — What does Monsieur Goethe say about it?” We do not know
Goethe’s reply, but Mul - ler reported that as Goethe was leaving the
room Napoleon remarked to his generals, “ Voila un homrne /” ( Behold a
man!) 3</p>
<p>6 06</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>607</p>
<p>On October 6 Napoleon returned to Weimar, taking with him a company
of actors from Paris, the great Talma among them. They played, in
Goethe’s theater, Voltaire’s La Mort de Cesar. After the performance the
Emperor took Goeth e aside and discussed tragedy. “The serious drama,”
he said, “could very well be a school for princes as well as for the
people, for in cer - tain ways it is above history…. You ought to
portray the death of Caesar more magnificently than Voltaire has done,
and show how happy Caesar [Napoleon] would have made the world if the
people had only granted him time in which to carry out his lofty plans.”
And a little later: “You must come to Paris! I make this definite
request of you! You will there obtain a larger view of the world, and
you will find a wealth of themes for your poetry.” 4 — When Napoleon
passed through Weimar again, after his disas- trous retreat from Moscow,
he asked the French ambassador to convey his greetings to Goethe.</p>
<p>The poet felt that in Bonaparte he had met, as he expressed it, “the
great - est mind the world has ever seen.” 5 He quite approved
Napoleon’s rule of Germany; after all (Goethe had written in 1807),
there was no Germany, only a farrago of petty states, and the Holy Roman
Empire had ceased to exist in 1806; it seemed good to Goethe that Europe
should be united, espe- cially under so brilliant a head as Bonaparte’s.
He did not rejoice over Napo - leon’s defeat at Waterloo, thou gh his
Duke again led the Weimar regiments against the French. His culture and
concern were too universal to let him feel much patriotic glow; and he
could not find it in him, though often asked to do so, to write songs of
nationalistic fervor. In his eightieth year he said to Eckermann:</p>
<p>How could I write songs of hatred when I felt no hate? And, between
our- selves, I never hated the French, although I thanked God when we
were rid of them. How could I, to whom the only significant things are
civilization [Kultur] and barbarism, hate a nation which is among the
most cultivated in the world, and to which I owe a great part of my own
culture? In any case this business of hatred between nations is a
curious thing. You will always find it most powerful and barbarous on
the lowest levels of civilization. But there exists a level at which it
wholly disappears, and where one stands, so to speak, above the nations,
and feels the weal or woe of a neighboring people as though it were
one’s own. This level was appropriate to my nature; I had reached it
long before my sixtieth year. 6</p>
<p>Would that there had been, in every major state, a million such “good
Eu - ropeans”!</p>

<li>FAUST: PART I</li>
</ol>
<p>Goethe did not accept Napo leon’s invitation to move to Paris or to
write about Caesar; he had long nurtured in his mind and his manuscripts
a subject that moved him more deeply than even the most majestic
political career: the struggle of the soul toward understanding and
beauty, the defeat of the soul by the brevity of beauty and the
elusiveness of truth, and the peace ob-</p>
<p>6o8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>amable by the soul through narrowing the goal and broadening the
self. But how to vision all this in a modern parable and dramatic form?
For fifty-eight years Goethe tried.</p>
<p>He had learned the story of Faust 7 in his childhood through
chapbooks and puppet shows, and he had seen pictures of Faust and the
Devil on the walls of Auerbach’s cellar in Leipzig. He himself, in
youth, had meddled with magic and alchemy. His own restless search for
understanding went into his conception of Faust; his reading of Voltaire
and his contact with Herder’s sarcasms went into Mephistopheles; the
Gretchen whom he had loved in Frankfurt, and the Friederike Brion whom
he had deserted in Se- senheim, gave name and form to Margaret.</p>
<p>How deeply the story of Faust moved Goethe, how varied the forms it
took in his thought, shows in the fact that he began to write the play
in 1773, and did not finish it till 1831. Of his meeting with Herder in
1771 he wrote in his autobiography:</p>
<p>I most carefully concealed from him my interest in certain subjects
which had rooted themselves in me, and were, little by little, molding
themselves into poetic form. These were Gotz von Berlichingen and
Faust…. The significant puppet show of the latter resounded and
vibrated, many -toned, within me. I too had wandered about in all sorts
of science, and had early enough been led to see its vanity. I had,
moreover, tried all sorts of ways in real life, and had al- ways
returned unsatisfied and troubled. Now these things, as well as many
others, I carried about with me, and delighted myself with them in
solitary hours, but without writing anything down. 8</p>
<p>On September 17, 1775, he told a correspondent: “I felt fresh this
morning, and wrote a scene of my Faust” 9 Later in that month Johann
Zimmermann asked him how the play was progressing. “He brought in a bag
filled with a thousand fragments of paper, and threw it on the table.
‘There,’ he said, ’is my Faust?” 10 When he went to Weimar (November,
1775) the first form of the drama was complete. 11 Dissatisfied with it,
he put it aside; this Urfaust , or Original Faust , never reached print
till 1887, when a manuscript copy made by Fraulein von Gochhausen was
found in Weimar. 12 Through fifteen more years he revised and expanded
it. Finally he published it (1790) as Faust , ein Fragment , which now
runs to sixty-three pages; 13 this was the first printed form of the
most famous play since Hamlet.</p>
<p>Still discontent with it, Goethe dropped the theme till 1797. On June
22 he wrote to Schiller: “I have determined to take up my Faust again,…
breaking up what has been printed, arranging it in large masses,… and
further preparing the development…. I only wish that you would be so
good as to think the matter over on one of your sleepless nights, and
tell me what you would demand of the whole, and to interpret my dreams
to me like a true prophet.” Schiller replied the next day: “The duality
of human nature, and the unsuccessful endeavor to unite in man the
godlike and the physical, is never lost sight of…. The nature of the
subject will force you to treat it philosophically, and the imagination
will have to accommodate itself to serve a rational idea.” Goethe’s
imagination was too rich, his vividly remembered experiences too many;
he inserted many of them into the Frag -</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>609</p>
<p>merit , doubling its size, and in 1808 he gave the world what we now
call Faust , Part I.</p>
<p>Before letting his puppet say a word, he prefixed to the drama a
tender Zueignung — dedication — to his dead friends; and a droll
“Prologue in the Theater” between manager, playwright, and jester; and a
“Prologue in Heaven” wherein God bets Mephistopheles that Faust cannot
be perma - nently won to sin. Then at last Faust speaks, in simplest
doggerel:</p>
<p>Habe nun , ach! Philosophic ,</p>
<p>Juristerei und Medizin y</p>
<p>Und leider auch Theologie</p>
<p>Durchaus studiert , mit heissem Be -</p>
<p>miihn.</p>
<p>Da steh ich nun y ich armer T or!</p>
<p>Und bin so klug als v)ie zuvor.</p>
<p>Heisse Magister, heisse Doktor gar ,</p>
<p>Und ziehe schon an die zehen Jahr</p>
<p>Herauf, herab, und quer und krumm</p>
<p>Meine Schuler an der Nase herum ,</p>
<p>Und sehe dass njuir nichts njuissen kon -</p>
<p>nen.</p>
<p>I have studied, alas, philosophy,</p>
<p>Jurisprudence, and medicine too,</p>
<p>And, saddest of all, theology,</p>
<p>With ardent labor, through and</p>
<p>hrough.</p>
<p>And here I stick, as wise, poor fool,</p>
<p>As when my steps first turned to</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>Master they style me, nay, Doctor</p>
<p>forsooth,</p>
<p>And nigh ten years, over rough and</p>
<p>smooth</p>
<p>And up and down, and acrook and</p>
<p>across,</p>
<p>I lead my pupils by the nose,</p>
<p>And know that in truth we can know</p>
<p>naught. 14</p>
<p>This four- foot meter, handed down from Hans Sachs’s playlets, proved
to be just the rippling rhythm for a drama that chastened philosophy
with fun.</p>
<p>Faust, of course, is Goethe, even to being a man of sixty years; and,
like Goethe, he was still, at sixty, thrilled by feminine loveliness and
grace. His double aspiration for wisdom and beauty was the soul of
Goethe; it chal- lenged the avenging gods by its presumption, but it was
noble. Faust and Goethe said Yea to life, spiritual and sensual,
philosophical and gay. By contrast, Mephistopheles (who is not Satan but
only Satan’s philosopher) is the devil of denial and doubt, to whom all
aspiration is nonsense, all beauty a skeleton wearing skin. In many
moments Goethe was this mocking spirit too, or he could not have given
him such wit and life. At times Mephistoph- eles seems to be the voice
of experience, of realism and reason checking the romantic desires and
delusions of Faust; indeed, Goethe told Eckermann, “the character of
Mephistopheles is… a living result of an extensive ac - quaintance with
the world.” 15</p>
<p>Faust does not sell his soul unconditionally; he agrees to go to hell
only if Mephistopheles shows him a pleasure so durably satisfying that
he will be glad to stay with it forever:</p>
<p>If ever on the bed of sloth I loll contented ever,</p>
<p>Then with that moment end my race!…</p>
<p>Should I to any moment say,</p>
<p>“Tarry a while, you are so fair!”*</p>
<p>Then may you into fetters cast me;</p>
<p>Then will I gladly go down there.</p>
<p>Verweile doch, du bist so schon!</p>
<p>6 io</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>On this condition Faust signs the compact with his blood, and cries
reck- lessly, “Our glowing passions in a sensual sea now will we
quench!” 16</p>
<p>So Mephistopheles takes him to Margaret — “Gretchen.” Faust finds in
her all the charm of that simplicity which departs with knowledge and
returns with wisdom. He woos her with jewels and philosophy:</p>
<p>MARGARET.</p>
<p>FAUST.</p>
<p>MARGARET.</p>

<p>MARGARET.</p>

<p>Thou art a good and kindly man,</p>
<p>And yet, I think, small heed thereto dost pay.</p>
<p>Enough, dear child! I love thee, thou dost feel.</p>
<p>For those I love my blood and life I’d spill,</p>
<p>Nor of his faith, his church, would any man bereave.</p>
<p>That is not right! We must believe!…</p>
<p>Dost thou believe in God?</p>
<p>What man can say, my dearest,</p>
<p>“I believe in God”?…</p>
<p>Then thou believest not?</p>
<p>Thou winsome angel-face, mishear me not!</p>
<p>Who can name Him? Who thus proclaim him?</p>
<p>I believe Him?</p>
<p>Who that has feeling, his bosom steeling,</p>
<p>Can say, “I believe Him not”?</p>
<p>The All-embracing, the All-sustaining;</p>
<p>Clasps and sustains He not</p>
<p>Thee, me, Himself?</p>
<p>Springs not the vault of heaven above us?</p>
<p>Lieth not earth, firm- ’stablished, ’neath our feet?…</p>
<p>Great though it be, fill thou therefrom thine heart,</p>
<p>And when in the feeling wholly blest thou art,</p>
<p>Call it then what thou wilt!</p>
<p>Call it Bliss, Heart, Love, God!</p>
<p>I have no name for it.</p>
<p>Feeling is all [Gefiihl ist alles ] !</p>
<p>Name is but sound and smoke</p>
<p>Clouding the glow of heaven….</p>
<p>It seemeth fair in these words of thine,</p>
<p>But yet… thou hast no Christianity.</p>
<p>Dear child! 17</p>
<p>She is moved not by his cloudy pantheism but by the fine figure and
raiment with which Mephistopheles’ magic has endowed his restored youth.
She sings at her spinning wheel a song of wistful longing:</p>
<p>Meine Ruh ist bin,</p>
<p>Mein Herz ist schwer ,</p>
<p>Ich finde sie nimmer</p>

<p>And kiss him, as fain</p>
<p>I would, then I,</p>
<p>Faint with his kisses,</p>
<p>Should swoon and die ! 18</p>
<p>All the Western world knows the rest of the story, if only through
Gou- nod. Margaret, in order to kiss and swoon unchaperoned, gives her
mother a sleeping potion, from which the mother never wakes. Faust kills
Margaret’s brother Valentine in a duel, and then disappears; Margaret,
in shame and grief, kills her fatherless child; she is arrested and
condemned to death. Faust visits her in her dungeon and begs her to
escape with him; she em- braces him, but refuses to leave her cell.
Mephistopheles draws Faust away, while a voice from heaven cries, “She
is redeemed.”</p>
<p>Only slowly did the reading public realize that this Faust of 1 808
was the finest drama and the finest poetry that Germany had yet
produced. But some alert few recognized it at once as fit to stand among
the peaks of the world’s literature. Friedrich Schlegel compared Goethe
with Dante, Jean Paul Richter equaled him with Shakespeare; Wieland gave
him in the realm of poetry the same sovereignty that Napoleon then held
in government and war. 19</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>NESTOR IN LOVE</li>
</ol>
<p>In the years 1 8 1 8-2 1 Goethe had two soul-stirring romances, not
counting Bettina Brentano. On April 23, 1807, Bettina, twenty-two, came
to the aging poet with a letter of introduction from Wieland. She was
the granddaughter of Sophie von La Roche, who had loved Wieland, and she
was the daughter of Maximiliane Brentano, who had flirted with Goethe;
she felt that she had a primogenital lien on Goethe’s heart. Soon after
entering his ro om she flung herself into his arms. He accepted her as a
child, and thereafter corre- sponded with her in that sense; but he
enclosed with his letters the latest love poems he had written, and
though they were not addressed to her she treated them as declarations
of passion, and gave them that color in the Goethes Briefwechsel mit
einem Kinde (Goethe’s Correspondence with a Child) which she published
in 1835.</p>
<p>Most of the poems had been inspired by Wilhelmine Herzlieb. Minna, as
Goethe soon called her, was the daughter of a Jena bookseller. He had
known her as a child, but in 1808 she was nineteen, modest, tender, and
blooming. She hung on every word that he spoke, and mourned that age and
status forbade her to love and possess him. He perceived her feeling,
re- sponded to it, wrote sonnets to her, punning on her name as a loving
heart; but he recalled that he had only recently made Christiane his
wife. He seems</p>
<p>612 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXIV</p>

affection- ate Ottilie of the Elective Affinities ( 1 809).</p>
<p>This remarkable novel — Die Wahlverwandtschaften — is, as its author
thought, 20 his best work of prose fiction, far better organized and
more com- pactly told than either of the Wilhelm Meister
circumambulations. Note Goethe’s words to Eckermann (February 9, 1829):
“In the whole of the - selves except love.” 21 ) But it is because there
is so much of Goethe in this book that it is warm with life and rich in
thought: because the Charlotte of the story is again Charlotte von
Stein, tempted, but refusing, to be unfaithful to her husband; because
the Captain is Goethe in love with his friend’s wife; because Edward,
the fifty-year-old husband infatuated with Ottilie, is Goethe drawn to
Minna Herzlieb; and because the novel is Goethe’s attempt</p>
<p>He here proposed to think of sexual attraction in chemical terms. He
may have taken his title from the Elective Affinities published by the
great Swed- ish chemist Torbern Olof Bergman in 1775. The Captain
describes to Ed- ward and Charlotte the attractions, repulsions, and
combinations of material particles: “You ought yourselves to se e these
substances — which seem so dead and are yet so full of energy and force
— at work before your eyes. Now they seek each other out,… seize, crush,
devour, destroy one another, and then suddenly they reappear… in fresh,
renovated, unexpected forms.” 22 So, when Edward invites his friend the
Captain, and Charlotte in - vites her niece Ottilie, to stay with them
for long visits, the Captain falls in love with Charlotte, and Edward
falls in love with Ottilie. When Edward has intercourse with his wife he
thinks of Ottilie, and Charlotte thinks of the Captain, in a kind of
psychological adultery. The offspring looks strangely like Ottilie, and
Ottilie takes to the child as if her own. Then, apparently by accident,
she lets it drown; in remorse she starves herself to death. Edward dies
of a broken heart; the Captain disappears; Charlotte survives,
spiritually dead. A town philosopher concludes: “Marriage is the
beginning and end of all civilization. It tames the savage, and gives to
the most cultivated their best opportunity for gentleness. It should be
indissoluble, for it brings so much happiness that its incidental
tribulations count for nothing in the scale.” 23 Four pages later,
however, one character suggests trial marriage, in which the contract is
for only five years at a time.</p>
<p>In 1810 we find Goethe at Karlsbad taking the waters and flirting
with young women, while Christiane, four years married, remained at
home, flirting with young men. The sixty-one-year-old poet won the
passionate love of a darkly beautiful Jewess, Marianne von Eybenberg;
then he fled from her with blond Silvie von Ziegesar. In a poem
addressed to Silvie he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) GOETHE NESTOR 613</p>
<p>called her “daughter, mistress, darling, white, and slim.” 24
Christiane sent him appeals for fidelity:</p>
<p>And have Bettina and that Frau von Eybenberg arrived in Karlsbad yet?
They say here that Silvie and the Gotters are to be there, too. So what
will you do, between all your flirtations? Rather too many! But you
won’t forget your oldest one, will you? Think of me a little, too, now
and then. I mean to trust you absolutely, whatever people may say. For
you are the only one, you know, who thinks of me at all. 25</p>
<p>He sent her little gifts.</p>
<p>He found time almost every day to compose some poetry or prose. About
1 809 he began to write his autobiography. He called it Aus meinem Leben
Dichtung und Wahrheit ( Fiction and Truth from My Life). The title hand-
somely admitted that he might now and then, intentionally or not, have
mingled imagination with reality. He touched only lightly and delicately
on his love for Charlotte Buff, but told more fully of his romance with
Frieder- ike Brion; both of these women still lived. He analyzed well
and generously many friends of his youth — Lenz, Basedow, Merck, Herder,
Jacobi, Lavater. Of himself he spoke modestly; his private notes
complained that the auto- biographer is expected to confess his faults
but not to reveal his virtues. 26 The book is the history of a mind
rather than of a life; incidents in it are few, re- flections abound. It
is his greatest book of prose.</p>
<p>In 1 8 1 1 he received from Beethoven a letter of admiration, with
the Over- ture to Egmont. Poet and composer met at Teplitz in July,
1812; Beethoven played for Goethe, and took walks with him. If we may
trust the novelist August Frankl, “wherever they went, the people on the
promenade respect - fully made way for them and saluted them. Goethe,
annoyed by these con- stant interruptions, sa id, ‘What a nuisance! I
can never avoid this sort of thing!’ With a smile, Beethoven answered,
‘Don’t let it bother your Excel - lency; the homage is probably meant
for me.’” Goethe wrote to Zelter (September 2, 1812): “Beethoven’s
talent astonished me; his personality, alas, is wholly ungovernable. He
is not wrong… in finding the world detestable, but this attitude renders
it more enjoyable neither to him nor to others. Much of it is to be
excused on the deplorable ground that he is losing his he aring.” 27
Beethoven’s comment on Goethe: “What patience the great</p>
<p>Court appearances and conduct were part of Goethe’s official life,
for he was still active in administration. His home life had lost its
charm: August, twenty-two in 1812, was an unsalvageable mediocrity, and
Christiane was fat and taking to drink. She had some excuse, for his
flirtations continued. During his visits to Frankfurt he often stayed at
the suburban villa of Johann von Willemer, and admired Willemer’s wife,
Marianne. In the summer of 1815 he spent almost four weeks with them.
Marianne was thirty-one, but she was in the fullness of woman ly beauty.
She sang Goethe’s lyrics and Mozart’s arias enchantingly, wrote
excellent verse, and exchanged with Goethe a series of poems in
imitation of Hafiz, Firdausi, and other Persian</p>
<p>6 14 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>bards. (Hafiz had been translated into German in 1812.) Some of the
poems are frankly sensual and tell of mutual joy in physical embraces,
but this li- cense may be merely poetic. The three met again in
September at Heidel- berg; the two poets took long walks together, and
Goethe wrote Marianne’s name in Arabic letters in the dust around the
castle fountain. They never saw each other again after that day, but
they corresponded through the sev- enteen remaining years of his life.
Willemer seems to have cherished his wife all the more for having
charmed so famous a man, and for answering Goethe’s verse with poems
scarcely inferior to his own. Goethe included hers with his in the
Westostlicher Diwan ( West-Eastern Book of Many Leaves ) that he
published in 1 8 1 9.</p>
<p>While this correspondence was proceeding in prose and rhyme, Christi-
ane died (June 6, 1816). Goethe noted in his diary: “Her death struggle
was dreadful…. Emptiness and deathly silence within and around me.” 29 A
profound depression clouded these years. When Charlotte Kestner, the
lost beloved of his youth, now the sixty-four-year-old wife of the
successful Councilor Kestner of Hanover, visited him with her daughter
(September 25, 1816), no emotion seemed to stir in him, and all his talk
was courteous triviality. But in 1817 his son August, interrupting a
career of dissipation, married Ottilie von Pogwisch; Goethe invited them
to live with him; Ottilie brought the gaiety of youth into the
household, and soon gave the aging poet grandchildren who made his heart
beat again.</p>
<p>Ulrike von Levetzow helped. She was one of the three daughters of
Ama- lie von Levetzow, whom Goethe had known in Karlsbad. At Marienbad
in August, 1821 , he met Ulrike, who later recalled: “As I had been for
some years in a French boarding school at Strasbourg, and was only
seventeen, I had never heard of Goethe, and had no idea that he was a
famous man and a great poet. So I wasn’t at all shy with the friendly
old gentleman…. The very next morning he asked me to take a walk with
him…. He took me along on his walk nearly every morning.” 30 He returned
to Marienbad in 1822, and “all that summer Goethe was very friendly to
me.” A year later they met in Karlsbad, and soon they stirred the gossip
of the spa. By this time the poet had decided that his love was more
than paternal. Duke Karl August urged Ulrike to marry Goethe; if she
would do this a fine house would be given to her family in W eimar, and
after the poet’s death she would receive a pension of ten thousand
thalers a year. 31 Mother and daughter refused. Goethe returned desolate
to Weimar, and drowned his disappointment in ink. Ulrike lived to be
ninety-five.</p>
<p>In that year 1821 which led Goethe to Ulrike, Karl Zelter, music
director at Jena, brought to him in Weimar a twelve-year-old pupil,
Felix Mendels- sohn. Zelter had opened Goethe’s soul to the world of
music, and had even taught him to compose. Now the skill of the young
pianist astonished and gladdened the old poet, who insisted on having
him stay with him for sev- eral days. “Every morning,” Felix wrote on
November 6, “the author of Faust and Werther kisses me. In the afternoon
I play for him for about two hours, partly fugues of Bach, partly my
improvisations.” On November 8</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>615</p>
<p>Goethe held a reception to introduce Felix to Weimar society. On
Novem- ber 10 Felix wrote: “Every afternoon he opens the piano and says,
‘I have not heard you at all today. Come, make a little noise for me!’
Then he sits down next to me and listens. You have no idea how kind and
affectionate he is.” When Zelter wished to take Felix back to Jena,
Goeth e persuaded him to let his pupil remain a few days more. “Now,”
wrote the happy boy, “gratitude to Goethe rose on all sides, and the
girls and I kissed his lips and hands. Ottilie von Pogwisch threw her
arms around his neck; and since she is very prett y, and he flirts with
her all the time, the effect was excellent.” 82 There are happy moments
in history behind the drama of tragedy, and be- neath the notice of
historians.</p>

<li>THE SCIENTIST</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us go back to his younger years, when, with alert attention and
omniv- orous interest, he had begun his lifelong pursuit of science. Few
of us have known that Goethe devoted more time to scientific
investigation and com- positions than to all his poetry and prose
combined. 38 He had studied medi- cine and physics at Leipzig, chemistry
at Strasbourg; he took up anatomy in 1781; and for years he wandered
about Thuringia gathering mineral and botanical specimens and observing
geological formations. In his travels he noted not merely men, women,
and art, but also fauna and flora, optical and meteorological phenomena.
He took a leading part in establishing laborato- ries in Jena. He
rejoiced or grieved as intensively over his victories or defeats in
science as over his successes or failures in literature.</p>
<p>He did something about the weather. He organized meteorological
obser- vation stations in the duchy of Saxe- Weimar, helped to set up
others throughout Germany, 34 and prepared instructions for them. He
wrote essays on “The Theory of Weather” and “The Causes of Barometric
Fluctua - tions.” He persuaded Duke Karl August to begin the collections
that formed the core of the Museum of Mineralogy at Jena. After studying
the geologi- cal strata at I lmenau he argued that they confirmed
Abraham Werner’s the - ory that all the rocky formations on the earth’s
crust were the result of the slow action of water. (This “Neptunist”
theory has had to be combined with the “Vulcanist” theory of change by
viole nt action.) He was among the first to suggest that the age of
strata might be judged from the fossils imbedded in them, and to defend
the view that the great boulders now er- ratically distributed in high
places had been swept up there by surges of ice coming down from the
Arctic Zone. 85</p>
<p>In 1791-92 Goethe published in two volumes Beitrage zur Optik ( Con-
tributions to Optics). “My purpose,” he wrote, “has been to assemble all
that is known in this field, and to undertake all the experiments
myself, vary- ing them as much as possible, making them easier to
follow, and keeping them within the scope of the ordinary person.” 36
During the years from 1790 to 1810 he made numberless experiments to
explain color; the Goethe</p>
<p>6x6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Museum at Weimar still preserves the instruments he used. The result
ap- peared in 1810 in two large volumes of text, and one of plates,
entitled Xur Farbenlehre (On the Theory of Color)-, this was his major
work as a scien- tist.</p>
<p>He studied colors as due not only to the chemical composition of
objects but to the structure and operation of the eye. He analyzed the
adaptation of the retina to darkness and light, the physiology of color
blindness, the phenomena of color shadows and afterimages, the effects
of color contrasts and combinations in sensation and in art. He
mistakenly thought of green as a blend of yellow and blue. (They do
blend so on the artist’s palette, but when the blue and yellow of the
color spectrum combine they yield gray and white.) He repeated many of
the experiments described in Newton’s Optic ks (1704), found in several
cases results different from those there re- ported, and ended by
accusing Newton of incompetence and occasional deceit. 37 He opposed
Newton’s view that white is a composition of colors, and held that their
combination regularly produced not white but gray. — Neither his
contemporaries nor his successors in the field of optics accepted his
conclusions. They praised his experiments and discarded many of his
theories. In 1815 Arthur Schopenhauer, who admired Goethe as a poet and
as a philosopher, sent him an essay ably defending Newton’s conception
of white as a composition of colors; the old man never forgave him. The
gen- eral rejection of the Farbenlehre added to the gloom of his final
years.</p>
<p>A man so sensitive to color as Goethe was could not but be fascinated
by the world of plants. At Padua in 1786 he was thrilled by the
botanical gar- dens; here was a richer and more varied collection than
he had ever seen. He saw how different the plants of the south were from
those of the north, and he resolved to study the influence of
environment upon the form and growth of plants. Nor had he ever felt so
deeply the mysterious and over- whelming capacity of nature to develop
each form, with its unique pattern of structure, texture, color, and
line, out of apparently simple and similar seeds. What fertility, and
what originality! But were there some common elements in all the
diversity of individuals, and in all the evolution of organs and parts?
The idea came to him that these genera, species, and varieties were
variations of a basic archetype; that all these plants, for example,
were formed on some fundamental and original — even if imaginary —
model, an Urpflanze, or First Plant, the mother of them all. “The same
law” or theory, he wrote to Herder, “will be applicable to all that
lives”— i.e., to animals as well as plants; they too are variations on
one structural theme. 38 And as the individual organism, with all its
uniqueness, is an imitation of a primal arche- type, so the parts of an
organism may be variations of one fundamental form. Goethe noticed in
Padua a palmetto whose leaves were in diverse stages of development; he
studied the visible transitions from the simplest leaf to the complete,
majestic fan; and he conceived the idea that all the structures of a
plant — except the axis, or stem — were variations and stages of the
leaf.*</p>
<ul>
<li>Caspar Friedrich Wolff had come to the same conclusion in 1768.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>617</p>
<p>After his return to Weimar Goethe published his theory in an
eighty-six- page book entitled An Attempt by J. W. von Goethe, Privy
Councilor of the Duchy of Saxe- Weimar, to Explain the Metamorphosis of
Plants (1790). Botanists laughed at it as the dreams of a poet, and
advised the poet to stick to his trade. 39 He took them at their word,
and rephrased his views in a poem, “The Metamorphosis of Plants.”
Gradually the theory accumulated evidence and supporters. In 1830
Etienne Geoff roy Saint- Hilaire presented Goethe’s essay to the French
Academy of Sciences as a work of careful research and creative
imagination confirmed by the progress of botany. 40</p>
<p>Applying his theory to anatomy, Goethe suggested (1790) that the
skull is a variation and continuation of the vertebrae, enclosing the
brain as the spine encloses the spinal cord. There is no agreement today
on this concep- tion. One definite and brilliant achievement is credited
to Goethe in anatomy — the demonstration of an intermaxillary bone in
man. (This is the bone, between the maxillae, or jaw bones, that carries
the upper incisor teeth.) The anatomists had recognized such a bone in
animals, but had questioned its existence in man; Goethe’s discovery
narrowed the structural difference between man and the ape. Hear the
poet proclaim his success in a letter from Jena to Charlotte von Stein,
March 27, 1784 — the lover and the scientist all compact: “A few lines
to my Lotte by way of saying good morning…. I have been granted a
delightful satisfaction. I have made an anatomical dis- covery that is
at once beautiful and important. You shall have your share in i t, but
do not say a word about it.” 41 He announced his finding in a manu -
script monograph sent to divers scientists in 1784 and entitled
“Versuch, aus der vergleichenden Knochenlehre, dass der Zwischenknochen
der oberen Kinnlade dem Menschen mit den i ibrigen Thieren gemein sei”
(An Attempt, Based on Comparative Osteology, to Show That the
Intermaxillary Bone in the Upper Jaw is Common to Man and the Higher
Animals). This was “the first treatise ever written that can be properly
described as lying in the field of comparative anatomy, and thus it is a
milestone in the history of this sci- ence.” 42 (The French anatomist
Felix Vicq d’Azyr published the same dis - covery in the same year
1784.)</p>
<p>In his essay Goethe wrote: “Man is very closely akin to the brute
crea - tion…. Every creature is only a tone, a modification, in a mighty
har- mony.” 43 Like many scientists and philosophers before him, he
thought of man as part of the animal kingd om, and wrote a poem, “The
Metamorpho - sis of Animals.” But he was not an evolutionist in the
Darwinian sense. Following Linnaeus, he assumed the fixity of species;
so his Urpflanze was not an actual primitive plant from which all plants
had evolved, but only a general type of which all plants were
modifications. Goethe did not, like his contemporaries Lamarck and
Erasmus Darwin, think of species evolving from other species by the
environmental selection of favorable variations.</p>
<p>Was Goethe a real scientist? Not in the professional sense; he was a
zeal- ous and enlightened amateur, a scientist between poems, novels,
amours, artistic experiments, and administrative chores. He used
extensive equipment, collected a large library of science, made useful
observations and careful</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>experiments; Helmholtz testified to the factual accuracy of the
objective processes and experiments that Goethe described. 44 He avoided
teleological explanations. But he was not accepted as a scientist by
professionals, for these looked upon him as a dilettante who depended
too trustfully upon intuition and hypothesis. He passed too quickly from
one subject or investi- gation to another, touching each at some special
point, and achieving no- where, except in optics and the theory of
color, a survey of the field. But there was something ideal and heroic
in his divergent and polymorphous persistence. Said Eckermann in 1825:
“Goethe will be eighty ye ars old in a few years, but he is not tired of
inquiries and experiments. He is always on the track of some great
synthesis.” 45 And perhaps the poet was right in thinking that the chief
aim of science should not be to equip old desires with new tools, but to
enlarge wisdom with knowledge for the enlightenment of desire.</p>
<p>V. THE PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>As in science, so in philosophy he was a lover, not a professor —
though it was he who secured the appointment of Fichte, Schelling, and
Hegel to chairs of philosophy at Jena. He had very little interest in
the debates of the schools, but he was endlessly concerned with the
interpretation of nature and the meaning of life. As he became older he
grew through science and poetry into a sage. He found illumination about
the whole from every ob- ject, moment, and part: “Alles V ergangliche
ist nur ein Gleichnis”— every- thing transient is but a symbol. 46 The
Spriiche in Prosa, or incidental apo- thegms, which he left unprinted at
his death, ooze wisdom on every page.</p>
<p>He offered no system of logic, but he suggested, pragmatically, that
“that - sist acknowledging reality, only because they would collapse if
they ac- cepted it.” 51</p>
<p>But Goethe rejected materialism as well as subjectivist idealism.
D’Hol - bach’s Sy steme de la nature “appeared to us [students at
Strasbourg] so dark,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>… so deathlike, that we found it a trouble to endure its presence,
and shuddered at it as at a specter.” 82 That was in youth, but in old
age he felt likewise, writing to Knebel, April 8, 1812:</p>
<p>A man who does not grasp the fact, nor rise to the vision, that
spirit and mat- ter, soul and body, thought and extension,… are the
necessary twin ingredi- ents of the universe, and will forever be; and
that these two have equal rights, and may therefore be considered in
their togetherness as the representatives of God: he who has not grasped
this might as well employ his days with the idle gossip of the
world.</p>
<p>This, of course, is Spinoza, and Goethe usually follows Spinoza into
determin- ism — “We belong to the laws of nature, even when we rebel
again st them”; 83 but at times he inclines to agree with Kant that “our
lives, like the universe to which we belong, are mysteriously composed
of freedom and necessity.” 54 He felt a force of destiny working in him—
of qualities com- pelling and determining his development; but he
co-operated with it, like some free agent serving a cause that moves and
includes him.</p>
<p>His religion was an adoration of nature, and a desire to collaborate
with her creative forces — her multiform productivity and her obstinate
perse- verance; however, he took long to acquire her patience. He
vaguely per- sonified Nature, seeing mind and will in her, but a mind
quite unlike ours, and a will indifferently neutral as between men and
fleas. Nature has no moral feelings in our sense of the obligation of
the part to co-operate with the whole, for she is the whole. In the poem
“Das Gottliche” (1782) Goethe described nature as without feeling or
mercy. She destroys as exuberantly as she makes. “All your ide als shall
not prevent me [Goethe] from being genu- ine, and good and bad, like
Nature.” 55 Her only ethic is, Live and make live. Goethe recognized the
need many souls have for supernatural support, but he felt no such need
until his final years. “He ha s religion [enough] who has art or
science; who has not art or science needs religion.” 56 “As a poet and
artist I am a polytheist [personifying the separate forces of nature],
while in my role as scientist I incline to pantheism [seeing one God in
every- thing].” 57</p>
<p>“Resolutely pagan” in religion and morals, he had no sense of sin,
felt no need of a god dying to atone for him, 58 and resented all talk
of the cross. He wrote to Lavater, August 9, 1782: “lam no anti
-Christian, no un-Christian, but very decidedly a non-Christian…. You
accept the Gospel, as it</p>
<p>stands, as divine truth. Well, no audible voice from heaven would
convince me that a woman bears a child without a man, and that a dead
man arises from the grave. I regard all these as blasphemies against God
and his revela- tion of himself in nature.” 59 Lavater pressed him
(Goethe tells us), and “at last came out with the hard dilemma, ‘Either
Christian or atheist!’ Upon this I declared that if he would not leave
me my own Christianity as I had hith- erto cherished it, I could readily
decide for atheism, especially as I saw that nobody knew precisely what
either term meant.” 60 Goethe thought that “the Christian religion is an
abortive political revolution that turned moral.” 61 There are in
literature “a thousand pages as beautiful and useful” as in the</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Gospels. 62 “Yet I regard all four Gospels as quite genuine, for in
them is evident the reflected splendor of the sublime power which
emanated from the person of Christ and his nature, which was as divine
as ever the divine has appeared on earth…. I bow before him as a divine
manifestation of the highest principle of morality.” 63 But he proposed
to worship the sun as much as Christ, as equally a manifestation of
divine power. 64 He admired Luther, and praised the Reformation for
breaking the shackles of tradition, but he regretted its relapse into
dogma. 65 He suspected that Protestantism would suffer for lack of
inspiring, habit-forming ceremonies, and he thought Catholicism wise and
beneficent in symbolizing spiritual relations and devel- opments with
impressive sacraments. 66</p>
<p>Goethe’s views on immortality were a function of his years. On
February 2, 1789, he wro te to Friedrich zu Stolberg: “For my own part I
cling more or less to the teachings of Lucretius, and confine myself and
all my hopes to this life.” But on February 25, 1824, he told Eckermann:
“I would by no means dispense with the happiness of believing in a
future existence; and in- deed I would say, with Lorenzo de’ Medici,
that those who hope for no other</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, I can have no knowledge of God except such as I
derive from the limited vision of my sensory perceptions on this single
planet. Such knowledge is a fragment of a fragment. I do not admit that
this limitation, which is applicable to our observation of nature, need
be applicable in the ex- ercise of faith. The contrary is the case. It
may well be that our knowledge, necessarily imperfect, demands
supplementation and perfecting through an act of faith. 70</p>
<p>In 1820 he regretted that he had written the rebellious Prometheus in
his youth, for the young radicals of the day were quoting it against
him. 71 He turned away from Fichte when Fichte was accused of atheism.
72 “It is our duty,” he now held, “to tell others no more than they are
able to receive. Man grasps only what is to his measure.” 78</p>
<p>Like his views of religion, his conception of morality changed with
age. Bouncing with youthful energy and pride, he had interpreted life as
purely a theater for self- development and display. “This craving to
raise as high as possible the pyramid of my life, the base of which has
been given and estab- lished for me, outweighs all else, and scarcely
permits of a moment’s re - lapse.” 74 We have seen him hurting some
tender souls in this process. As he matured through political office he
perceived that human life is a co-opera- tive process; that the
individual survives by mutual aid, and that self-seeking actions, though
still the basic force, must be limited by the needs of the group. Faust,
in Part I, is individualism incarnate; in Part II he finds “salva -
tion,” health of soul, through working for the general good. Wilhelm

<p>To become noble one must beware of debasing influences, and “all is

works have maintained their value and stature for centuries. A truly
gifted man will naturally so incline, and the desire to delve into the
great precursors is the very mark of a higher endowment.” 76 Reverence

<p>hat liberates the mind without giving us dominion over ourselves is
perni- cious.” 78 Plan your l iving — gedenke zu leben ! — but seek a
balance between thought and action; thought without action is a disease.
“To know and prac - tice a craft lends greater culture than
half-knowledge a hundred times over.” 79 “No blessing is equal to the
blessings of work.” 80 Above all, be a whole or join a whole. “Only
mankind is the true man, and the individual can be joyous and happy only
when he has the courage to feel himself in the whole.” 81</p>
<p>So the young man who inherited comfort and security, and set the
Stras- bourg students laughing at his rich and fancy dress, learned,
through the philosophers, the saints, and the experience of life, to
think kindly of the poor, and to wish that the fortunate would share
their wealth more gener- ously. Nobles should be taxed in proportion to
their income, and should let their dependents benefit from “the
advantages which expanding knowledge and prosperity are bringing.” 82
Even after attaining Europea n fame, Goethe felt the bourgeois’ envy of
noble birth. “In Germany no one except a noble - man has an opportunity
for acquiring a well-rounded… personal cul- ture.” 83 He observed all
the usual obeisances in his behavior toward his su - periors. Everyone
knows the story of Goethe and Beethoven at Teplitz, July, 1812; but its
sole source is the unreliable Bettina Brentano von Arnim, who claimed to
be quoting Beethoven’s account:</p>
<p>Kings and princes can indeed bestow titles and orders, but they
cannot make great men, who therefore must be held in respect. When two
come together, such as Goethe and I, then these highborn gentlemen must
observe what it is that counts for great with such as we. Yesterday we
met the whole Imperial Family [of Austria], and Goethe disengaged
himself from my arm in order to stand aside. I pressed my hat down on my
head and went through the thickest of the crowd with my arms hanging at
my sides. Princes and courtiers drew up in a double line; the Duke of
Weimar took off his hat to me, and the Em- press greeted me first. Much
to my amusement I saw the procession file by Goethe, who stood at one
side, bowing with his hat in his hand. I took him roundly to task for it
afterward. 84</p>
<p>Our reaction to this story will vary with our age. Goethe felt than
an aristocracy functioning actively and with public spirit provided the
best government then possible in Europe, and deserved the respect
required for social order and control. Abuses should be reformed, but
without violence or precipitancy; revolutions cost more than they are
worth, and usually end where they began. So Mephistopheles to Faust:</p>
<p>Alack! Away! Forbear of yonder squabble</p>
<p>’Twixt tyranny and slavery to babble!</p>
<p>It irks m e. Scarce ’tis ended when de novo</p>
<p>With the whole farce they start ab ovo. 85</p>
<p>And so Goethe to Eckermann in 1824: “It is quite true that I was no
friend of the French Revolution. Its horrors were too immediate,… while
its beneficial effects were not yet visible…. But I was just as little a
friend of the arbitrary rule that had preceded it. I was convinced even
then that</p>

<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>623</p>
<p>no revolution is the fault of the people, but always the fault of the
govern- ment.” 88 He welcomed Napoleon as a boon to order in France and
Europe after a decade of convulsions. He distrusted democracy, for
“nothing is worse than active ignorance”; 87 and “it is unthinkable that
wisdom should ever be popular.” 88</p>
<p>He laughed a t the oscillation of power between parties. “In
politics, as on a sickbed, men toss from side to side in the hope of
lying more com- fortably.” 89 He opposed freedom of the press on the
ground that it subjected</p>
<p>Goethe fulfilled to the maximum the obligation of the old to serve as
a brake upon the energy of the young.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>FAUST: PART II</li>
</ol>
<p>He poured his aging philosophy into Part II of Faust. At the end of
Part I he had left his alter ego, broken and desolate, in the power of
Mephistoph- eles — desire punished for its excess. But could that be
all, and the sum of wisdom? Faust had not quite lost his wager; the
Devil had not yet found for him any delight that could calm his striving
and fill his life. Was there any- where such a fulfillment? Through
twenty-four years Goethe struggled to find for the story a continuation
and a culmination that should contain or symbolize the conclusions of
his thought, and should give to his hero a noble and inspiring end.</p>
<p>At last, aged seventy-eight, he faced the task. On May 24, 1827, he
wrote to Zelter, who had grown old with him and was to die with him: “I
want</p>
<p>Only in the assurance of eighty years can one take time to read all

<p>624 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Faust, Part II, today. From the opening scene, in which Faust,
awaking in spring fields, describes the sunrise with no word-worn
eloquence, the action repeatedly stops for lyric paeans to nature’s
beauty or grandeur or terror; it is well done, but too often; Goethe,
preaching classic restraint, here sins against “nothing too much.” He
poured into the drama almost everything that cluttered his teeming
memory: Greek and German mythologies, Leda and the swan, Helen and her
train, witches and knights and fairies and gnomes, griffins and pygmies,
dryads and sirens, dissertations on “Neptu - nian” geology, long
speeches by heralds, flower girls, garden nymphs, wood - cutters,
punchinellos, drunkards, pages, seneschals, wardens, a charioteer and a
sphinx, an astrologer and an emperor, fauns and philosophers, the cranes
of Ibycus, and a “little man” (homunculus) chemically created by Faust’s
pupil Wagner. The farrago is more confusing than a tropical jungle, for
it adds the supernatural to the natural, and endows everything with ora-
tory or song.</p>
<p>What a comfort it is when, in Act III, Helen appears, still
miraculously dia gynaikon — goddess among women — conquering men with
the grace of her movement or the glance of her eyes. The story takes on
new force, and the chorus rises to a Sophoclean tone, when Helen hears
that Menelaus, as punishment for “beauty insolently bold,” has ordered
her and her attendant</p>
<p>The scene changes; years have flown by; Euphorion is a happy youth,
gladdening Faust and Helen with “caresses, playful banter, sportive
calls ,” 93 leaping recklessly from cliff to cliff, gently cautioned by
his parents, danc- ing wildly with nymphs entranced by his charm (Byron
in Italy?); he seizes one of them rapturously, only to have her burst
into flame in his arms. Hear- ing with welcome the tocsin of war, he
rushes off, falls from a precipice, and, dying, summons his mother to
join him in the nether world.</p>
<p>Helen [to Faust]. Woe is me! An ancient adage proves on me its truth
—</p>
<p>That fortune weds with Beauty never abidingly.</p>
<p>Asunder rent the bond of life is, as of love,</p>
<p>And, both bewailing, anguished, I say farewell,</p>

<p>and veil remain in his arms.)</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>So ends the third and finest act of this second Faust. This was the
part that Goethe wrote first, which he called Helena , and which for a
time he thought of as a separate and finished whole; he might have done
well to leave it so. Here, by some heroic draft upon his surviving
powers, Goethe rose for the last time to the peak of his poetry,
mingling drama with music as in Periclean days, and raising to life and
blood the figures of a complex allegory for the healing of the modern
mind.</p>
<p>From that height Faust II slips down to a war between an emperor and
a contender for the Holy Roman throne. Faust and Mephistopheles, using
their magic arts, win the war for the emperor; Faust asks and receives,
as reward, great stretches of the Empire’s northern c oast, with such
land as he can wrest from the sea. In Act V Faust, a hundred years old,
is master of a vast domain, but not yet of himself. The cottage of a
peasant couple, Phile- mon and Baucis, obstructs the view from his
mansion; he offers them a bet- ter home elsewhere; they refuse; he asks
Mephistopheles and his agents to drive them out; meeting resistance,
they set fire to the cottage; the old couple die of fright. Faust is
soon haunted by visions of avenging Furies — gray hags named Want,
Guilt, Care, Need, and Death. Care breathes into his face and blinds
him. A partly unselfish thought raises him out of despair: he orders
Mephistopheles and his devils to dike the sea, drain the swamps, and
build, on the new land, a thousand homes amid green fields; he visions
this re- claimed terrain, and feels that if he could “with a free people
stand on a free soil,” he would at last say to such a moment, “Tarry a
while, thou art s o fair.” 94 He hears the sounds of picks and spades,
and thinks that his grand design is progressing; actually the devils are
digging his grave. Exhausted, he falls dying to the ground;
Mephistopheles gloats over him as a horde of devils prepares to ta ke
Faust’s soul to hell; but a host of angels swoops down from heaven, and
while Mephistopheles is distracted with admiration of their legs they
“bear aloft the mortal remains of Faust.” In heaven Faust, new -clothed
in a transfigured body, is greeted by a glorified Gretchen, who begs the
Vir- gin Mother: “Grant me to teach him!” The Virgin bids her lead him
up - ward, and a Chorus Mysticus ends the play:</p>
<p>Alles V ergdngliche</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>sultant Gesprache vrit Goethe (three volumes, 1836-48) — partly
revised by Goethe — contains more wisdom than is to be found in most
philosophers.</p>
<p>In September, 1825, Weimar celebrated the semicentennial of Karl Au-
gust’s accession. Goethe attended the ceremony. The Duke grasped his
hand, and murmured to him, “Together to the last breath.” 95 On November
7 the court celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Goethe’s coming to
Weimar, and the Duke sent him a letter which was also made a public
proclamation:</p>
<p>With profound pleasure I would mark the fiftieth return of this day
as the jubilee not only of the premier servant of my state but of the
friend of my youth, who has accompanied me through all the mutability of
life with un- changed affection, loyalty, and steadfastness. I owe the
happy outcome of my most important undertakings to his circumspect
counsel, his ever-living sympa- thy and beneficent service. To have
attached him permanently to myself I re- gard as one of the highest
ornaments of my reign. 96</p>
<p>Now came those sadly aging years when friend after friend disappears.
On August 26, 1826, two days before Goethe’s seventy -seventh birthday,
Charlotte von Stein, eighty-four years old, sent her last known letter
to her lover of half a centu ry before: “All my best wishes and
blessings on this day. May the guardian angels in the heavenly
parliament command that all that is good or beautiful be granted to you,
my very dear friend. I continue to remain yours in hope and without
fear, while I beg of you for myself your freely given kindness during
the brief span that remains to me.” 97 She died on January 6, 1827.
Hearing of it, Goethe wept. On June 15, 1828, the Duke died, and Weimar
knew that its golden age was ending. Goethe prepared for his turn by
working feverishly on Faust. But he was not next in line. His only
surviving child, August, after forty years of failure, twenty of
dissipa- tion, died in Rome, October 27, 1830. A post-mortem showed a
liver five times the normal size. W hen the news was brought to Goethe
he said, “ Non ignoravi me mortalem genuisse — l was not unaware that I
had begotten a mortal.” 98 “I tried to absorb myself in work,” he wrote;
“I forced myself to continue Volume IV of Poetry and Truth.</p>
<p>At eighty he began to narrow his interests. In 1829 he stopped
reading newspapers. “I can’t begin to tell you,” he wrote to Zelter,
“the time I have gained, and the things I have accomplished, during the
six weeks that I have left all French and German papers unopen ed.” 100
“Fortunate is he whose world lies in his home.” 101 He enjoyed love and
care from August’s widow, Ottilie, and he took delight in her children.
Sometimes, however, he with- drew even from them, and sought full
privacy, praising solitude as the nurse and test of a well-furnished
mind.</p>
<p>His face now showed its eighty years: deep wrinkles across the
forehead and around the mouth; silver hair receding; eyes quiet and
wondering; but his stature was erect and his health was good. He prided
himself on having avoided coffee and tobacco, both of which he condemned
as poisons. He was vain of his looks and his books, honestly relished
praise, gave it frugally. When, in 1830, a young poet sent him a volume
of verse, Goethe acknowl- edged it caustical ly: “I have glanced through
your little book. Since, how -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>GOETHE NESTOR</p>
<p>627</p>
<p>ever, in an epidemic of cholera, one must protect oneself against
weakening influences, I have laid it aside.” 102 Mediocrity offended
him. He grew more and more irritable as the years threw him back into
himself, and he admitted as much: “Everyone who, judging by my work,
considered me amiable, found himself greatly deceived when he came in
contact with a man of cold- ness and reserve.” 103 Visitors de scribed
him as slow to thaw, a bit formal and stiff, perhaps out of
embarrassment, or grudging time taken from his tasks. Yet many of his
letters show tenderness and consideration.</p>
<p>He was now famous throughout Europe. Carlyle acclaimed him, long be-
f ore Goethe’s death, as one of the great figures in world literature.
Byron dedicated Werner to him; Berlioz dedicated The Damnation of Faust
to “Monseigneur Goethe”; kings sent him gifts. But in Germany bis
reading public was small, the critics were hostile, his rivals belittled
him as a pompous councilor affecting to be a poet and a scientist.
Lessing condemned Gotz and Werther as romantic trash; Klopstock scorned
Hermann und Dorothea as commonplace, and Iphigenie as a “stiff”
imitation of the Greeks. Goethe re- acted with repeated expressions of
contempt for Germany — for its climate, scenery, history, language, and
mind. He complained that he had “to write in German, and thereby…
squandered life and art on the worst mate- rial.” 104 He told his
friends that “these fools of Germans” had quite deserved</p>
<p>Detached from the main (Romantic) stream of literature in his old
age, he consoled himself with deepened contempt of the world and man.
“Viewed from the heights of reason, all life looks like some malignant
disease, and the world like a madhouse.” 108 “A few days ago,” he wrote
to Zelter on March 26, 181 6, “I came upon a copy of the first edition
of Werther, and that long - silenced song began to rise again. It was
hard for me to understand how a man could endure the world for forty
years when he had seen its absurdity even in his youth.” 107 And he loo
ked for no substantial betterment in the future. “Men exist only to
trouble and kill one another; so was it, so is it, so will it ever be.”
108 Like most of us after sixty, he thought that the new gen - eration
was degenerate. “The incredible arrogance i n which the young are
growing up will show its results in a few years in the greatest
follies…. Yet much is stirring that in after years may be cause for
rejoicing.” 109</p>
<p>On March 15, 1832, he caught a cold while out driving. On the
eighteenth he seemed recovered, but on the twentieth the infection had
sunk into his chest, catarrhal fever consumed him, and his face was
distorted with pain. On the twenty- second he noted that spring had
begun; “perhaps this will help me to get well.” The room had been
darkened to ease his eyes; he pro- tested, “Let in more light.” Still
oppressed by the gloom, he ordered his valet, “Open the blind of the
other window, so that more light may come in.” These were apparently his
last words. He had asked Ottilie, “Little woman, give me your little
paw.” He died in her arms and holding her hand, at noon, March 22, 1832,
aged eighty-two years and seven months. 110</p>
<p>Eckermann saw the corpse on the next day.</p>
<p>628</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>The body lay naked, wrapped only in a white sheet…. The valet drew
aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the godlike magnificence of the
limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs
were full, and softly muscular; the feet were elegant, and of the most
perfect shape; nowhere on the whole body was there a trace either of fat
or of leanness or decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me;
and the rapture which the sight caused me made me forget for a moment
that the immortal spirit had left this abode. 111</p>
<p>So ended a great age, from Frederick’s somber triumph in 1763 through
Lessing and Kant, Wieland and Herder, to Schiller and Goethe. Not since
Luther had the German mind been so active, so various, so rich in
independ- ent thought. It was no disaster for Germany that it was not an
expanding em- pire like Britain’s, absorbed in conquest and trade; nor a
centralized mon - archy like the French, falling apart through the
failure of government; nor a despotism like Russia’s, gorging itself
with land or stupefying itself with holy water. Politically, Germany was
not yet born, but in literature she was challenging, and in philosophy
she was leading, the Western world.</p>
