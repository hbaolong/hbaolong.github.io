<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XAntony</p>
<p>44 - 3 ° B - c -</p>
<p>I. ANTONY AND BRUTUS</p>
<p>T HE assassination of Caesar was one of the major tragedies of
history.</p>
<p>Not merely in the sense that it interrupted a great labor of
statesman- ship and led to fifteen years more of chaos and war;
civilization survived, and Augustus completed what Caesar had begun. It
was a tragedy also in the sense that probably both parties were right:
the conspirators in thinking that Caesar meditated monarchy, Caesar in
thinking that disorder and empire had made monarchy inevitable. Men have
divided on the issue ever since the Senate sat for a moment in
consternation at the deed and then fled in tumult and terror from the
hall. Antony, arriving after the event, saw valor in discretion and
fortified himself in his house. Cicero’s eloquence lost its tongue, even
when Brutus, dagger in hand, h ailed him as “Father of His Country.”
Emerging, the conspirators found an excited populace in the square; they
tried to win it with catchwords of Liberty and the Republic, but the
dazed crowd had no homage for phrases so long used to cover greed.
Fearing for their lives, the assassins took refuge in the buildings on
the Capitol and surrounded themselves there with their personal
gladiatorial guards. Toward evening Cicero joined them. Antony,
approached by their emissaries, sent a friendly reply.</p>
<p>The next day a larger crowd gathered in the Forum. The conspirators
sent agents to buy its support and organize it into a legal assembly;
then they ventured down from the Capitol, and Brutus delivered an
oration which he had prepared for the Senate. The speech failed to move
its hearers. Cassius tried and was met with cold silence. The Liberators
returned to the Capitol, and as the crowd thinned out they stealthily
departed to their homes. Antony, thinking himself Caesar’s heir,
obtained from the stunne d Calpurnia all the papers and funds that the
dictator had left in his palace; at the same time he secretly summoned
Caesar’s veterans to Rome. On the 17th, by his authority as tribune, he
convened the Senate and astonished all parties by his amiabilit y and
calm. He accepted Cicero’s proposal for a general amnesty, and agreed
that Brutus and Callus should receive provincial governorships</p>

<p>ANTONY</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>(i.e., flight with safety and power) , on condition that the Senate
should ratify all the decrees, legislation, and appointments of Caesar.
Since a majority of the Senate owed offlce or emoluments to these acts,
it consented; and when it adjourned Antony was acclaimed as a statesman
who had snatched peace out of the jaws of war. That evening he
entertained Cassius for dinner. On the 1 8th the Senate met again,
recognized Caesar’s will, voted him a public funeral, and appointed
Antony to deliver the customary eulogy.</p>
<p>On the 19th Antony secured the will from the Vestal Virgins, with
whom it had been deposited, and read it, first to a small, then to a
larger gathering. It bequeathed Caesar’s private fortune to three
grandnephews and (to the astonishment and anger of Antony) named one of
them, Caius Octavius, as adoptive son and heir. The dictator had devised
his gardens to the people as a public park and had left 300 sesterces to
every citizen of Rome. The news of these benefactions sped through the
city; and when, on the 20th, Caesar’s body, which had been embalmed in
his home, was brought into the Forum for the last rites, a great
concourse of people, including Caesar’s veterans, gathered to do him
reverence. Antony seems to have spoken at first with cautious restraint;
but as he went on, his pent-up feelings flared into eloquence. When he
raised from the ivory bier the torn and bloody robe through which Caesar
had been stabbed, the emotions of the crowd were stirred beyond control.
Amid weird wailing and frenzied cries men gathered wood anywhere and
built a fire beneath the corpse. Veterans threw their weapons upon the
pyre as an offering, actors threw their costumes, musicians their
instruments, women their most precious ornaments. Taking brands from the
fire, some enthusiasts sought to bum down the houses of the
conspirators; but these buildings were well guarded, and their masters
had fled from Rome. A large part of the crowd stayed all night long by
the smoldering pyre; many Jews, grateful for Caesar’s sympathetic
legislation, remained there three days, intoning their ancient funeral
chants. During those days riot surged through the capital; at last
Antony directed his sol- diers to restore order and to fling persistent
marauders from the Tarpeian rock.</p>
<p>Antony was one half of what Caesar had been, as Augustus would be the
other half; Antony was a good general, Augustus a superlative statesman;
neither would be both. Bom in 82 b.c., Antony had spent a large part of
his life in camps and more in the quest of wine, women, good food, and
fun. Though of high lineage and handsome features, he had the
characteristic vir- tues of the common man: strength of body, animal
spirits, good nature, gen- erosity, courage, and loyalty. He had
scandalized even Caesar by keeping a harem of both sexes in Rome, and
traveling with a Greek courtesan in his Ut- ter. 1 He had bought in
Pompey’s house at auction, occupied it, and then re -</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>fused payment. 2 Now he found in Caesar’s papers, or (some said)
placed there, whatever it suited him to find — appointments for his
friends, decrees for his purposes, perquisites for himself; in two
weeks’ time he had paid off ,500,000 in debts and had become a rich man.
He seized the 5,000,000 that Caesar had deposited in the Temple of Ops
and took another ,000,000 from Caesar’s private treasury. Noting that
Decimus Brutus, whom Caesar had appointed governor of Cisalpine Gaul,
had assumed that lucrative office despite sharing in the assassination
of Caesar, Antony passed through the Assembly a bill giving himself that
strategic province and consoling Decimus with Macedonia. Likewise Marcus
Brutus and Cassius were to surrender Macedonia to Decimus and Syria to
Dolabella, and were to content them- selves with sharing Cyrene and
Crete.</p>
<p>Alarme d by Antony’s spreading power, the Senate invited to Rome, as
a foil to him, Caesar’s adopted son. Caius Octavius, who was to make
himself the greatest statesman in Roman history, was eighteen years old
in 44. By natural custom he took his adoptive fath er’s name; adding his
own as a modifier, he became Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus, until,
seventeen years later, he received that lofty name of Augustus by which
the centuries have known him. His grandmother was Caesar’s sister Julia;
his grandfather ha d been a banker of plebeian stock at Velitrae, in
Latium; his father had served as plebeian aedile, then praetor, then
governor of Macedonia. The boy was trained to Spartan simplicity, and
educated in the literature and philosophy of Greece and Rome. In the
last three years he had lived a good part of the time in Caesar’s
palace. It was one of the sorrows of Caesar’s life that he had</p>
<p>Late in March of 44 a freedman arrived at Apollonia, in Illyria,
where Octavian was stationed with the army, and brought the news of
Caesar’s death and will. T he sensitive youth was horrified at men’s
ingratitude; all his love for the great-uncle who had so cherished him,
and had worked so feverishly to rebuild a shattered state, welled up in
him and filled him with a silent resolve to complete the labors of
Caesar and avenge his death. He rode down to the sea, crossed to
Brundisium, and hastened to Rome. His</p>
<p>ANTONY</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>relatives there advised him to stay in hiding lest Antony destroy
him; his mother likewise recommended inaction; but when he scorned such
a course she rejoiced, merely suggesting that whenever possible he
should use pa- tience and subtlety rather than open war. He followed
this wise counsel to the end.</p>
<p>He visited Antony and inquired what was being done against Caesar ’s
enemies. He was shocked to find Antony busy planning to lead an army
against Decimus Brutus, who had refused to surrender Cisalpine Gaul. He
asked Antony to disburse Caesar’s legacies according to will, especially
the forty-five dollars bequeathed to every citizen. Antony saw many
reasons for delay. Octavian thereupon distributed the money to Caesar’s
veterans</p>
<p>Infuriated by the insolence of this “boy,” as he called him, Antony
an - nounced that an attempt had been made upon his life and that the
would-be assassin had named Octavian as the instigator of his plan.
Octavian protested his innocence. Cicero took advantage of the quarrel
to persuade him that Antony was a ruffian, who must be defeated.
Octavian agreed, joined his two legions with those of the consuls
Hirtius and Pansa, and marched with them northward to battle Antony.
Cicero lent this new civil war the aid of his invective in fourtee n
powerful “Philippics” against the public policy and private life of
Antony, some delivered to the Senate or the Assembly, the rest published
as propaganda broadcasts in the best tradition of martial blackening. In
the ensuing engagement at Mutina (Modena), Antony lost and fled (44) ;
but Hirtius and Pansa fell, and Octavian returned to Rome sole commander
of the Senate’s legions as well as his own. With this force behind him
he compelled the Senate to name him consul, to repeal its amnesty to the
conspirators, and to sentence them all to death. Discovering that Cicero
and the Senate were now his enemies, and were merely using him as a
temporary tool against Antony, he composed his differences with An- tony
and formed with him and Lepidus the Second Triumvirate (43-33). Their
combined armies marched into Rome and took it without resist- ance. Many
of the senators and conservatives fled to south Italy and the provinces.
The Assembly ratified the Triumvirate and gave it full power for five
years.</p>
<p>To pay their troops, replenish their coffers, and revenge Caesar, the
three men now let loose the bloodiest reign of terror in Roman history.
They listed 300 senators and 2000 businessmen for execution, and offered
25,000 drachmas (5,000) to any freeman, and 10,000 to any slave, who
would bring in the head of a person proscribed. 4 To have money became a
capital crime; children to whom fortunes had been left were condemned
and killed;</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xwidows were shorn of their legacies; 1400 rich women were required
to turn over a large share of their property to the Triumvirs; at last
even the savings deposited with the Vestal Virgins were seized. Atticus
was spared because he had helped Antony’s wife Fulvia; while a
cknowledging the courtesy, he sent great sums to Brutus and Cassius. The
Triumvirs set their soldiers to guard all exits from the city. The
proscribed hid in wells, sewers, attics, chimneys. Some died resisting,
some submitted quietly to their slay- ers; some starved, hanged, or
drowned themselves; some leaped from a roof or into a fire; some were
killed by mistake; some, not proscribed, committed suicide on the bodies
of slain relatives. Salvius the tribune, knowing him- self doomed, gave
a last feast to his friends; the emissaries of the Triumvirs entered,
cut off his head, left his body at the table, and bade the feast go on.
Slaves took the opportunity to get rid of hard masters, but many fought
to the death to protect their owners; one disguised himself as his
master and suffered decapitation in his stead. Sons died to protect
their fathers, others betrayed their fathers to inherit a part of their
fortunes. Adulterers or de- ceived wives surrendered their husbands. The
wife of Coponius secured his safety by sleeping with Antony. Antony’s
wife Fulvia had tried to buy the mansion of her neighbor Rufus; he had
refused to sell; now, though he of- fered it to her as a gift, she had
him proscribed and nailed his severed head to his front door.®</p>
<p>Antony placed Cicero high on the list of those who should be
killed.</p>
<p>Antony was the husband of Godius’ widow and the stepson of the Cata -
linarian Lentulus whom Cicero had slain in jail; and he resented with
some reason the unstinted vituperation of the “Philippics.” Octavian
protested, but not too long; he could not forget Cicero’s glorification
of Caesar’s assas - sins and the pun by which that reckless wit had
excused to the conservatives his dalliance with Caesar’s heir.* Cicero
tried to escape; but being buffeted and sickened by the sea, he
disembarked and spent the night in his villa at Formiae. The next day he
wished to stay there and await his executioners, preferring them to a
choppy sea; but his slaves forced him into a litter and were carrying
him toward the ship when Antony’s soldiers came upon them. The servants
wished to resist, but Cicero bade them set the litter down and yield.
Then, “his person covered with dust, his beard and hair untrimmed, and
his face worn with his troubles ,” 7 he stretched his head out so that
the soldiers might more conveniently decapitate him (43). By Antony’s
com - mand Cicero’s right hand was also cut off and brought with the
head to the Triumvir. Antony laughed in triumph, gave the assassins
250,000 drachmas, and had head and hand hung up in the Forum. 8</p>
<p>• Cicero had said of Octavian: laudandum adolescentem , omandtrm,
tollendum — “the boy is to be praised, decorated, and exalted”; but
tollendum also meant u to be killed.” 6</p>
<p>ANTONY</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>Early in 42 the Triumvirs led their forces across the Adriatic and
marched through Macedonia into Thrace. There Brutus and Cassius had
massed the last republican army, financed by exactions beyond even Roman
precedent. From the Eastern cities of the Empire they demanded, and
received, ten years’ taxes in advance. When the Rhodians jiroved
reluctant, Cassius stormed the great port, ordered all citizens to
surrender their wealth, killed those who hesitated, and carried away
0,000,000. In Cilicia he quartered his soldiers in the homes of Tarsus
till it paid him ,000,000 to leave; to raise this sum the citizens
auctioned off all municipal lands, melted down all tem- ple vessels and
ornaments, and sold free persons into slavery — first boys and girls,
then women and old men, finally youths; many, on learning that they had
been sold, killed themselves. In Judea Cassius levied ,200,000 and sold
the inhabitants of four towns into slavery. Brutus, too, could raise
money by force. When the citizens of Lycian Xanthus refused his demands,
he besieged them until, starving but obdurate, they committed suicide en
masse. 9 For the most part Brutus, loving philosophy, tarried in Athens;
but the city was filling with young Roman nobles clamoring for a war of
restoration. When sufficient funds had been raised Brutus closed his
books, joined his troops with those of Cassius, and took the field.</p>

<p>The old aristocracy fought its last land battle at Philippi. Many of
them —Cato’s son, Hortensius’ son, Qui ntilius Varus, and Quintus Labeo
— joined Brutus and Cassius in suicide. The victors divided the Empire
between them: Lepidus was given Africa, Octavian took the West, Antony,
having his choice, took Egypt, Greece, and the East. Always needing
money, Antony forgave the Eastern cities their contributions to his
enemies on condition that they give him a like sum — ten years’ taxes
within a year. His old geniality returned as victory made him seemingly
secure. He reduced</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhis demands upon the Ephesians when their women, dressed as
Bacchantes, greeted him as the god Dionysus; but he gave his cook the
house of a Mag- nesian magnate as reward for a distinguished supper. He
called an assembly of the Ionian cities at Ephesus and settled the
boundaries and affairs of these states with such good judgment that
Augustus a decade later found little to change. He pardoned all who had
fought against him except those who had shared in killing Caesar. He
gave relief to the cities that had suffered most severely from Cassius
and Brutus, released several of them from every Roman tax, freed many
who had been sold into slavery by the conspirators, and liberated the
cities of Syria from the despots who had overthrown their democracies.
10</p>
<p>While displaying these graces of his simple character, Antony surren-
dered to such exuberant sensuality that his subjects lost respect for
his authority. He surrounded himself with dancers, musicians,
courtesans, and roisterers, and took wives and concubines whenever a
fair woman struck his Olympian fancy. He had sent messengers to bid
Cleopatra present herself before him at Tarsus and answer charges that
she had aided Cassius to raise money and troops. She came, but in her
own time and way. While Antony sat on a throne in the forum, waiting for
her to plead and be judged, she sailed up the river Cydnus in a barge
with purple sails, gilded stem, and silver oars that beat time tO’ the
music of flutes and fifes and harps. Her</p>

<p>Lucius were plotting to overthrow Octavian’s power in Rome. Oct avian
had found no happiness there: the Senate was a rump of adventurers and
generals, labor was restless with unemployment, the populares were dis-
organized, Sextus Pompey was blocking the import of food, business was
petrified with fear, taxation and spoliation had ruined nearly every
fortune, and many men were living in a reckless and sensual riot on the
ground that the morrow might in any case bring repudiation of the
currency, or further spoliation, or death. Octavian himself was anything
but an exemplar of chastity at this time. To perfect the confusion,
Fulvia and Lucius raised an army and called upon Italy to oust him.
Marcus Agrippa, Octavian’s general, besieged Lucius in Perusia and
starved him out (March, 40). Fulvia died of illness, f rustrated
ambition, and grief over Antony’s neglect of her. Octavian pardoned
Lucius in the hope of maintaining peace with Antony, but Antony crossed
the sea and besieged Octavian’s troops in Brundisium. The armies,
showing more sense than their leaders, refused to fight each other, and
compelled them to a peaceable agreement (40). As a pledge of good
behavior Antony married Octavian’s sister, the gentle and virtuous
Octavia.</p>
<p>In 38 Octavian fell in love with Livia, the pregnant wife of
Tiberius</p>
<p>Claudius Nero. He divorced his first wife Scribonia, persuaded Nero
to release Livia, married her, and found, in her persuasive counsel and
her aristocratic connections as a member of the Claudian gens, a passage
to rec- onciliation with the propertied classes. He reduced taxes,
returned 30,000 runaway slaves to their masters, and set himself
patiently to restoring order in Italy. With the help of Agrippa, and of
1 20 ships contributed by Antony, he destroyed the fleet of Sextus
Pompey, secured Rome’s food supply, and ended the resistance of the
Pompeians (36). The Senate by acclamation named him tribune for
life.</p>
<p>After marrying Octavia in a state ceremony at Rome, Antony went with
her to Athens. There for a time he enjoyed the novel experience of
living with a good woman. He put aside politics and war and, with
Octavia at his side, attended the lectures of philosophers. Meanwhile,
however, he studied the plans that Caesar had left for conquering
Parthia. Labienus, son of Caesar’s general, had entered the services of
the Parthian king and had led Parthian armies victoriously into Cilicia
and Syria — lucrative provinces of Rome (40). To meet this threat Antony
needed soldiers; to pay soldiers he needed money; and of this Cleopatra
had plenty. Suddenly tiring of virtue and peace, he sent Octavia back to
Rome and asked Cleopatra to meet him at Antioch. She brought him a few
troops, but she disapproved of his gran- diose plans and apparently gave
him little of her fabulous treasury. He</p>
<p>20 6</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xinvaded Parthia with 100,000 men (36), tried in vain to capture its
citadels, and lost almost half his forces in a heroic retreat through
300 miles of hostile country. On the way he annexed Armenia to the
Empire. He awarded him- self a triumph and shocked Italy by celebrating
it at Alexandria. He sent a letter of divorce to Octavia (32), tnarried
Cleopatra, confirmed her and Caesarion as joint rulers of Egypt and
Cyprus, and bequeathed the Eastern provinces of the Empire to the son
and daughter that Cleopatra had borne him. Knowing that he would soon
have to square accounts with Octavian, he abandoned himself to a year of
frolic and luxury. Cleopatra encouraged him to dare the last gamble for
omnipotence, helped him to raise an army and a fleet, and chose as her
favorite oath, “As surely as I shall one day give judg - ment in the
Capitol.” 13</p>
<p>HI. ANTONY AND OCTAVIAN</p>
<p>Octavia bore her rejection silently, lived quietly in Antony’s house
at Rome, and brought up faithfully his children by Fulvia and the two
daugh- ters that she herself had given him. The daily sight of her mute
desolation inflame d Octavian’s conviction that both Italy and he were
doomed if An - tony’s plans succeeded. He saw to it that Italy should
realize the situation: Antony had married the Queen of Egypt, had
assigned to her and her illegiti- mate offspring the most tribute-
yielding of Rome’s provinces, was seeking to make Alexandria the capital
of the Empire, and would reduce Rome and Italy to subordinate roles.
When Antony sent a message to the Senate (which he had for years
ignored) proposing that he and Octavian should retire to private life,
and that the institutions of the Republic should be restored, Octavian
escaped a difficult situation by reading to the Senate what he claimed
was Antony’s will, which he had taken by force from the Vestal Virgins.
It named Anto ny’s children by Cleopatra his sole heirs, and directed
that he should be buried beside the Queen in Alexandria. 14 The last
clause was as decisive for the Senate as it should have proved
suspicious; instead of raising doubts that a will filed in Rome should
have made such provisions, it convinced the Senate and Italy that
Cleopatra was scheming to absorb the Empire through Antony. With
characteristic subtlety Octavian de- clared war (32) against her rather
than Antony, and made the conflict a holy war for the independence of
Italy.</p>
<p>In September, 32, the fleet of Antony and Cleopatra sailed into the
Ionian Sea, 500 warships strong; no such armada had been seen before.
Supporting it was an army of 100,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, mostly
supplied by Eastern princes and kings in the hope of making this a war
of liberation from</p>

<p>Rome. Octavian crossed the Adriatic with 400 vessels, 80,000 foot,
12,000 horse. For almost a year the rival forces prepared and
maneuvered; then, on September 2, 3 1, they fought at Actium, in the
Ambracian Gulf, one of the decisive battles of history. Agrippa proved
the better tactician, and his light ships more manageable than Antony’s
heavy -towered leviathans. Many of these were consumed by fires set by
burning brands cast upon them by Octavian’s crews. “Some sailors,” says
Dio Cassius,</p>
<p>perished by the smoke before the flames could reach them; others were
cooked in their armor, which became red hot; others were roasted in
their vessels as though in ovens. Many leaped into the sea; of these
some were mangled by sea monsters, some were shot by arrows, some were
drowned. The only ones to obtain an endurable death were</p>
<p>those who killed one another. 15</p>
<p>Antony saw that he was losing, and signaled to Cleopatra to carry out
their prearranged plan for retreat. She headed her squadron southward
and waited for Antony; unable to extricate his flagship, he abandoned it
and rowed out to hers. As they sailed for Alexandria he sat alone on the
prow, his head between his hands, conscious that everything was lost,
even honor.</p>
<p>From Actium Octavian went to Athens; thence to Italy to quell a
mutiny among his troops, who clamored for the plunder of Egypt; then to
Asia to depose and punish A ntony’s adherents and raise new funds from
long - suffering cities; then to Alexandria (30). Antony had left
Cleopatra and was staying on an island near Pharos; thence he sent
offers of peace, which Oc- tavian ignored. Unknown to Antony, Cleopatra
sent Octavian a golden scepter, crown, and throne as tokens of her
submission; according to Dio he replied that he would leave her and
Egypt untouched if she would kill Antony. 16 The beaten Triumvir wrote
to Octavian again, reminding him of their former fri endship and of “all
the wanton pranks in which they had shared as youths”; and agreed to
kill himself if the victor would spare Cleo - patra. Again Octavian made
no reply. Cleopatra gathered all that she could : the Egyptian treasury
into a palace tower and informed Octavian that she would destroy it all,
and herself, unless he granted an honorable peace. Antony led what small
forces remained to him in a last fight; his desperate courage won a
temporary victory; but on the next day, seeing Cleopatra’s mercenaries
surrender, and receiving a report that Cleopatra was dead, he stabbed
himself. When he learned that the report was false he begged to be
brought to the tower in whose upper chambers the Queen and her at-
tendants had locked themselves; they drew him up through the window, and
he died in her arms. Octavian allowed her to come forth and bury her
lover; then he granted her an audience and, immune to what lure survived
in a</p>

<p>Xbroken woman of thirty-nine, he gave her terms that made life seem
worth- less to one who had been a queen. Convinced that he intended to
take her as captive to adorn a Roman triumph, she arrayed herself in her
royal robes, put an asp to her breast, and died. Her handmaidens
Charmion and Iris followed her in suicide . 18</p>
<p>Octavian permitted her to be buried beside Antony. Caesarion, and An-
tony’s eldest son by Fulvia, he slew; the children of Antony and the
Queen he spared and sent to Italy, where Octavia reared them as if they
were her own. The victor found the Egyptian treasury intact and as
abundant as he had dreamed. Egypt escaped the indignity of being named a
Roman prov- ince; Octavian merely mounted the throne of the Ptolemies,
succeeded to their possessions, and left a praefectus to administer the
country in his name. Caesar’s heir had conquered those of Alexander, and
absorbed Alexander’s realm; die West again, as at Marathon and Magnesia,
had triumphed over the East. The battle of the giants was over, and an
invalid had won.</p>
<p>The Republic died at Pharsalus; the revolution ended at Actium. Rome
had completed the fatal cycle known to Plato and to us: monarchy, aris-
tocracy, oligarchic exploitation, democracy, revolutionary chaos,
dictator- ship. Once more, ill the great systole and diastole of
history, an age of freedom ended and an age of discipline began.</p>
