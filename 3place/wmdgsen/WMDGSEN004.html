<p>The Political Elements of Civilization</p>
<p>I. THE ORIGINS OF GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>The unsocial instinct — Primitive anarchism — The clan and the</p>
<p>tribe — The king — War</p>
<p>M AN is not willingly a political animal. The human male
associates</p>
<p>with his fellows less by desire than by habit, imitation, and the</p>
<p>compulsion of circumstance; he does not love society so much as he
fears solitude. He combines with other men because isolation endangers
him, and because there are many things that can be done better together
than alone; in his heart he is a solitary individual, pitted heroically
against the world. If the average man had had his way there would
probably never have been any state. Even today he resents it, classes
death with taxes, and yearns for that government which governs least. If
he asks for many laws it is only because he is sure that his neighbor
needs them; privately he is an unphilosophical anarchist, and thinks
laws in his own case superfluous.</p>
<p>In the simplest societies there is hardly any government.
Primitive</p>
<p>hunters tend to accept regulation only when they join the hunting
pack and prepare for action. The Bushmen usually live in solitary
families; the Pygmies of Africa and the simplest natives of Australia
admit only temporarily of political organization, and then scatter away
to their</p>
<p>family groups; the Tasmanians had no chiefs, no laws, no regular
govern- ment; the Veddahs of Ceylon formed small circles according to
family relationship, but had no government; the Kubus of Sumatra “live
without men in authority,” every family governing itself; the Fuegians
are seldom more than twelve together; the Tungus associate sparingly in
groups of ten tents or so; the Australian “horde” is seldom larger than
sixty souls . 1 In such cases association and cooperation are for
special purposes, like hunting; they do not rise to any permanent
political order.</p>
<p>The earliest form of continuous social organization was the clan — a
group of related families occupying a common tract of land, having the
same</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>22 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>totem, and governed by the same customs or laws. When a group of
clans united under the same chief the tribe was formed, and became the
second step on the way to the state. But this was a slow development;
many groups had no chiefs at all,’ and many more seem to have tolerated
them only in time of war.* Instead of democracy being a wilted feather
in the cap of our own age, it appears at its best in several primitive
groups where such government as exists is merely the rule of the
family-heads of the clan, and no arbitrary authority is allowed.* The
Iroquois and Delaware Indians recognized no laws or restraints beyond
the natural order of the family and die clan; their chiefs had modest
powers, which might at any time be ended by the elders of the tribe. The
Omaha Indians were ruled by a Council of Seven, who deliberated until
they came to a unanimous agreement; add this to the famous League of the
Iroquois, by which many tribes bound themselves — and honored their
pledge — to keep the peace, and one sees no great gap between these
“savages” and the modem states that bind themselves revocably to peace
in the League of Nations.</p>
<p>It is war that makes the chief, the king and the state, just as it is
these that make war. In Samoa the chief had power during war, but at
other times no one paid much attention to him. The Dyaks had no
other</p>
<p>government than that of each family by its head; in case of strife
they chose their bravest warrior to lead them, and obeyed him strictly;
but once the conflict was ended they literally sent him about his
business.* In the intervals of peace it was the priest, or head
magician, who had most authority and influence; and when at last a
permanent kingship developed as the usual mode of government among a
majority of tribes, it combined — and derived from — the offices of
warrior, father and priest. Societies are ruled by two powers: in peace
by the word, in crises by the sword; force is used only when
indoctrination fails. Law and myth have gone hand in hand throughout the
centuries, cooperating or taking turns in the manage- ment of mankind;
until our own day no state dared separate them, and perhaps tomorrow
they will be united again.</p>
<p>How did war lead to the state? It is not that men were naturally
in-</p>
<p>clined to war. Some lowly peoples are quite peaceful; and the Eskimos
could not understand why Europeans of the same pacific faith should hunt
one another like seals and steal one another’s land. “How well it is”—
they apostrophized their soil — “that you are covered with ice and snow!
How well it is that if in your rocks there are gold and silver, for
which the Christians are so greedy, it is covered with so much snow that
they</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 23</p>
<p>cannot get at it! Your unfruitfulness makes us happy, and saves us
from molestation .” 0 Nevertheless, primitiv e life was incarnadined
with inter- mittent war. Hunters fought for happy hunting grounds still
rich in</p>
<p>prey, herders fought for new pastures for their flocks, tillers
fought for virgin soil; all of them, at times, fought to avenge a
murder, or to harden and discipline their youth, or to interrupt the
monotony of life, or for simple plunder and rape; very rarely for
religion. There were institutions and customs for the limitation of
slaughter, as among ourselves — certain hours, days, weeks or months
during which no gentleman savage would kill; certain functionaries who
were inviolable, certain roads neutralized, certain markets and asylums
set aside for peace; and the League of the Iroquois maintained the
“Great Peace” for three hundred years . 7 B ut for the most part war was
the favorite instrument of natural selection among primitive nations and
groups.</p>
<p>Its results were endless. It acted as a ruthless eliminator of weak
peoples, and raised the level of the race in courage, violence, cruelty,
intelligence and skill. It stimulated invention, made weapons that
became useful tools, and arts of war that became arts of peace. (How
many railroads today begin in strategy and end in trade!) Above all, war
dissolved primitive communism and anarchism, introduced organization and
discipline, and led to the enslavement of prisoners, the subordination
of classes, and the growth of government. Property was the mother, war
was the father, of the state.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE STATE</li>
</ol>
<p>As the organization of force — The village community — The</p>
<p>psychological aides of the state</p>
<p>“A herd of blonde beasts of prey,” says Nietzsche, “a race of con
-</p>
<p>querors and masters, which with all its warlike organization and all
its organizing power pounces with its terrible claws upon a population,
in numbers possibly tremendously superior, but as yet formless, . . .
such is the origin of the state .” 8 “The state as distinct from tribal
organization,” says Lester Ward, “begins with the conquest of one race
by another .” 8 “Everywhere,” says Oppenheimer, “we find some warlike
tribe breaking through the -boundaries of some less warlike people,
settling down as nobility, and founding its state .” 18 “Violence,” says
Ratzenhofer, “is the agent which has created the state .” 11 The st ate,
says Gumplowicz, is the result of conquest, the establishment of the
victors as a ruling caste</p>
<p>24 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>over the vanquished. 13 “The state,” says Sumner, “is the product of
force, and exists by force.” 13</p>
<p>This violent subjection is usually of a settled agricultural group by
a</p>
<p>tribe of hunters and herders. 14 For agriculture teaches men pacific
ways, inures them to a prosaic routine, and exhausts them with the long
day’s toil; such men accumulate wealth, but they forget the arts and
sentiments of war. The hunter and the herder, accustomed to danger and
skilled in killing, look upon war as but another form of the chase, and
hardly more perilous; when the woods cease to give them abundant game,
or flocks decrease through a thinning pasture, they look with envy upon
the ripe fields of the village, they invent with modem ease some
plausible reason for attack, they invade, conquer, enslave and
rule.*</p>
<p>The state is a late development, and hardly appears before the time
of written history. For it presupposes a change in the very principle of
social organization — from kinship to domination; and in primitive
societies the former is the rule. Domination succeeds best where it
binds diverse natural groups into an advantageous unity of order and
trade. Even such conquest is seldom lasting except where the progress of
invention has strengthened the strong by putting into their hands new
tools and weapons for suppress- ing revolt. In permanent conquest the
principle of domination tends to be- come concealed and almost
unconscious; the French who rebelled in 1789 hardly realized, until
Camille Desmoulins reminded them, that the aris- tocracy that had ruled
them for a thousand years had come from Germany and had subjugated them
by force. Time sanctifies everything; even the most arrant theft, in the
hands of the robber’s grandchildren, becomes sacred and inviolable
property. Every state begins in compulsion; but the habits of obedience
become the content of conscience, and soon every citizen thrills with
loyalty to the flag.</p>
<p>The citizen is right; for however the state begins, it soon becomes
an in- dispensable prop to order. As trade unites clans and tribes,
relations spring up that depend not on kinship but on contiguity, and
therefore require an artificial principle of regulation. The village
community may serve as an example: it displaced tribe and clan as the
mode of local organization, and</p>
<p>• It is a law that holds only for early societies, since un der more
complex conditions a variety of other factors — greater wealth, better
weapons, higher intelligence — contribute to determine the issue. So
Egypt was conquered not only by Hyksos, Ethiopian, Arab and Turkish
nomads, but also by the settled civilizations of Assyria, Persia,
Greece, Rome and England — though not until these nations had become
hunters and nomads on an imperial- istic scale.</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 25</p>
<p>achieved a simple, almost democratic government of small areas
through a concourse of family-heads; but the very existence and number
of such com- munities created a need for -come external force that could
regulate their interrelations and weave them into a larger economic web.
The state, ogre though it was in its origin, supplied this need; it
became not merely an or- ganized force, but an instrument for adjusting
the interests of the thousand conflicting groups that constitute a
complex society. It spread the tentacles of its power and law over wider
and wider areas, and though it made external war more destructive than
before, it extended and maintained internal peace; the state may be
defined as internal peace for external war. Men decided that it was
better to pay taxes than to fight among themselves; better to pay
tribute to one magnificent robber than to bribe them all. What an inter-
regnum meant to a society accustomed to government may be judged from
the behavior of the Baganda, among whom, when the king died, every man
had to arm himself; for the lawless ran riot, killing and plundering
every- where . 15 “Without autocratic rule,” as Spencer said, “the
evolution of so - ciety could not have commenced .” 18</p>
<p>A state which should rely upon force alone would soon fall, for
though men are naturally gullible they are also naturally obstinate, and
power, like taxes, succeeds best when it is invisible and indirect.
Hence the state, in order to maintain itself, used and forged many
instruments of in- doctrination — the family, the church, the school —
to build in the soul of the citizen a habit of patriotic loyalty and
pride. This saved a thousand policemen, and prepared the public mind for
that docile coherence which is indispensable in war. Above all, the
ruling minority sought more and more to transform its forcible mastery
into a body of law which, while consolidating that mastery, would afford
a welcome security and order to the people, and would recognize the
rights of the “subject”* sufficiently to win his acceptance of the law
and his adherence to the State.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>Law-lessness — Law and custom — Revenge — Fines — Courts — Ordeal —
The duel — Punishment — Primitive freedom</p>
<p>Law comes with property, marriage and government; the lowest
societies manage to get along without it. “I h ave lived with
communities of savages in South America and in the East,” said Alfred
Russel Wallace, “who</p>
<p>Note how this word betrays the origin of the state.</p>
<p>26 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>have no law or law-courts but the public opinion of the village
freely expressed. Each man scrupulously respects the rights of his
fellows, and any infraction of those rights rarely or never takes place.
In such a com- munity all are nearly equal .” 17 Herman Melville writes
similarly of the Marques as Islanders: “During the time I have lived
among the Typees no one was ever put upon his trial for any violence to
the public. Every- thing went on in the valley with a harmony and
smoothness unparalleled, I will venture to assert, in the most select,
refined, and pious associations’ of mortals in Christendom .” 18 The old
Russian Government established courts of law in the Aleutian Islands,
but in fifty years those courts found no employment. “Crime and
offenses,” reports Brinton, “were so infre - quent under the social
system of the Iroquois that they can scarcely be said to have had a
penal code .” 19 Such are the ideal— perhaps the idealized — conditions
for whose return the anarchist perennially pines.</p>
<p>Certain amendments must be made to these descriptions. Natural socie-
ties are comparatively free from law first because they are ruled by
cus- toms as rigid and inviolable as any law; and secondly because
crimes of violence, in the beginning, are considered to be private
matters, and are left to bloody personal revenge.</p>
<p>Underneath all the phenomena of society is the great terra flrma of
cus- tom, that bedrock of time-hallowed modes of thought and action
which provides a society with some measure of steadiness and order
through all absence, changes, and interruptions of law. Custom gives the
same stability to the group that heredity and instinct give to the
species, and habit to the individual. It is the routine that keeps men
sane; for if there were no grooves along which thought and action might
move with unconscious ease, the mind would be perpetually hesitant, and
would soon take refuge in lunacy. A law of economy works in instinct and
habit, in custom and convention: the most convenient mode of response to
repeated stimuli or traditional sit- uations is automatic response.
Thought and innovation are disturbances of regularity, and are tolerated
only for indispensable readaptations, or promised gold.</p>
<p>When to this natural basis of custom a supernatural sanction is added
by rel igion, and the ways of one’s ancestors are also the will of the
gods, then custom becomes stronger than law, and subtracts substantially
from primi- tive freedom. To violate law is to win the admiration of
half the populace, who secretly envy anyone who can outwit this ancient
enemy; to violate custom is to incur almost universal hostility. For
custom rises out of the people, whereas law is forced upon them from
above; law is usually a de-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 27</p>
<p>cree of the master, but custom is the natural selection of those
modes of action that have been found most convenient in the experience
of the group. Law partly replaces custom when the state replaces the
natural order of the family, the clan, the tribe, and the village
community; it more fully replaces custom when writing appears, and laws
graduate from a code carried down in the memory of elders and priests
into a system of legislation pro- claimed in written tables. But the
replacement is never complete; in the determination and judgment of
human conduct custom remains to the end the force behind the law, the
power behind the throne, the last “magis - trate of men’s lives.”</p>
<p>The first stage in the evolution of law is personal revenge.
“Vengeance</p>
<p>murder of B by A’s son or friend C, the murder of C by B’s son or
friend D, and so on perhaps to the end of the alphabet; we may find
examples among the purest-blooded American families of today. This
principle of revenge persists throughout the history of law: it appears
in the Lex Talionis * — or Law of Retaliation — embodied in Roman Law;
it plays a large role in the Code of Hammurabi, and in the “Mosaic”
demand of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”; and it lurks behi
nd most legal punishments even in our day.</p>
<p>The second step toward law and civilization in the treatment of crime
was the substitution of damages for revenge. Very often the chief, to
maintain internal harmony, used his power or influence to have the re-
vengeful family content itself with gold or goods instead of blood. Soon
a regular tariff arose, determining how much must be paid for an eye, a
tooth, an arm, or a life; Hammurabi legislated extensively in such
terms. The Abyssinians were so meticulous in this regard that when a boy
fell from a tree upon his companion and killed him, the judges decided
that the bereaved mother should send another of her sons into the tree
to fall upon the culprit’s neck.” The penalties assessed in cases of
compos i- tion might vary with the sex, age and rank of the offender and
the injured; among the Fijians, for example, petty larceny by a common
man was con- sidered a more heinous crime than murder by a chief.”
Throughout the</p>
<p>A phrase apparently invented by Cicero.</p>
<p>28 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>history of law the magnitude of the crime has been lessened by the
magni- tude of the criminal.* Since these fines or compositions, paid to
avert revenge, required some adjudication of offenses and damages, a
third step towards law was taken by the formation of courts; the chief
or the elders or the priests sat in judgment to settle the conflicts of
their people. Such courts were not always judgment seats; often they
were boards of volun- tary conciliation, which arranged some amicable
settlement of the dis- pute, f For many centuries, and among many
peoples, resort to courts remained optional; and where the offended
party was dissatisfied with the judgment rendered, he was still free to
seek personal revenge . 23</p>
<p>In many cases disputes were settled by a public contest between the
parties, varying in bloodiness from a harmless boxing-match — as among
the wise Eskimos — to a duel to the death. Frequently the primitive mind
re- sorted to an ordeal not so much on the medieval theory that a deity
would reveal the culprit as in the hope that the ordeal, however unjust,
would end a feud that might otherwise embroil the tribe for generations.
Some- times accuser and accused were asked to choose between two bowls
of food of which one was poisoned; the wrong party might be poisoned
(usually not beyond redemption), but then the dispute was ended, since
both parties ordinarily believed in the righteousness of the ordeal.
Among some tribes it was the custom for a native who acknowledged his
guilt to hold out his leg and permit the injured party to pierce it with
a spear. Or the accused submitted to having spears thrown at him by his
accusers; if they all missed him he was declared innocent; if he was
hit, even by one, he was adjudged guilty, and the affair was closed . 23
From such early forms the ordeal persisted through the laws of Moses and
Hammurabi and down into the Middle Ages; the duel, which is one form of
the ordeal, and which historians thought dead, is being revived in our
own day. So brief and narrow, in some respects, is the span between
primitive and modern man; so short is the history of civilization.</p>
<p>The fourth advance in the growth of law was the assumption, by the
chief or the state, of the obligation to prevent and punish wrongs. It
is but a step from settling disputes and punishing offenses to making
some</p>

<li>Perhaps an exception should be made in the case of the Brahmans,
who, by the Code of Manu (VIII, 336-8), were called upon to bear greater
punishments for the same crime than members of lower castes; but this
regulation was well honored in the breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>fSome of our most modern cities are trying to revive this ancient

<p>effort to prevent them. So the chief becomes not merely a judge but a
lawgiver; and to the general body of “common law” derived from the</p>
<p>In general the individual has fewer “rights” in natural society
than</p>
<p>under civilization. Everywhere man is bom in chains: the chains
of</p>
<p>heredity, of environment, of custom, and of law. The primitive
in-</p>
<p>dividual moves always within a web of regulations incredibly
stringent and detailed; a thousand tabus restrict his action, a thousand
terrors limit his will. The natives of New Zealand were apparently
without laws, but</p>
<p>in actual fact rigid custom ruled every aspect of their lives.
Unchangeable and unquestionable conventions determined the sitting and
the rising, the standing and the walking, the eating, drinking and
sleeping of the natives of Bengal. The individual was hardly recognized
as a separate entity in natural society; what existed was the family and
the clan, the tribe and the village community; it was these that owned
land and exercised power. Only with the coming of private property,
which gave him economic authority, and of the state, which gave him a
legal status and defined rights, did the individual begin to stand out
as a distinct reality.“ Rights do not come to us from nature, which
knows no rights except cunning and strength; they are privileges assured
to individuals by the community as advantageous to the common good.
Liberty is a luxury of security; the free individual is a product and a
mark of civilization.</p>

always adds institutions for the perpetuation of the race. Until the
state — towards the dawn of the historic civilizations — becomes the
central and permanent source of social order, the clan undertakes the
delicate task of regulating the relations between the sexes and between
the generations; and even after the state has been established, the
essential government of mankind remains in that most deep-rooted of all
historic institutions, the family. It is highly improbable that the
first human beings lived in isolated fami- lies, even in the hunting
stage; for the inferiority of man in physiological organs of defense
would have left such families a prey to marauding beasts. Usually, in
nature, those organisms that are poorly equipped for individual defense
live in groups, and find in united action a means of survival in a world
bristling with tusks and claws and impenetrable hides. Presumably it was
so with man; he saved himself by solidarity in the hunting-pack and the
clan. When economic relations and political mastery replaced kinship as
the principle of social organization, the clan lost its position as the
sub- structure of society; at the bottom it was supplanted by the
family, at the top it was superseded by the state. Government took over
the problem of maintaining order, while the family assumed die tasks of
reorganizing indus- try and carrying on the race.</p>
<p>Among the lower animals there is no care of progeny; consequently
eggs are spawned in great number, and some survive and develop while the
great majority are eaten or destroyed. Most fish lay a million eggs per
year; a few species of fish show a modest solicitude for their
offspring, and find half a hundred eggs per year sufficient for their
purposes. Birds care better for their young, and hatch from five to
twelve eggs yearly; mammals, whose very name suggests parental care,
master the earth with an average of three young per female per year . 20
Throughout the animal world fertility and destruction decrease as
parental care increases; through- out the human world the birth rate and
the death rate fall together as civilization rises. Better family care
makes possible a longer adolescence, in which the young receive f uller
training and ’development before they are flung upon their own
resources; and the lowered birth rate releases human energy for other
activities than reproduction.</p>
<p>Since it was the mother who fulfilled most of the parental functions,
the family was at first (so far as we can pierce the mists of history)
organ- ized on the assumption that the position of the man in the family
was</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 31</p>
<p>superficial and incidental, while that of the woman was fundamental
and supreme. In some existing tribes, and probably in the earliest human
groups the physiological role of the male in reproduction appears to
have escaped notice quite as completely as among animals, who rut and
mate and breed with happy unconsciousness of cause and effect. The
Trobriand Islanders attribute pregnancy not to any commerce of the
sexes, but to the entrance of a baloma, or ghost, into the woman.
Usually the ghost enters while the woman is bathing; “a fish has bitten
me,” the girl rep orts. “When,” says Malinowski, “I asked who was the
father of an illegitimate child, there was only one answer — that there
was no father, since the girl was unmarried. If, then, I asked, in quite
plain terms, who was the</p>
<p>physiological father, the question was not understood. . . . The
answer would be: ‘It is a baloma who gave her this child.’ ” These
islanders had a strange belief that the baloma would more readily enter
a girl given to loose relations with men; nevertheless, in choosing
precautions against pregnancy, the girls preferred to avoid bathing at
high tide rather than to forego relations with men.” It is a delightful
story, which must have</p>
<p>proved a great convenience in the embarrassing aftermath of
generosity; it would be still more delightful if it had been invented
for anthropologists as well as for husbands.</p>
<p>In Melanesia intercourse was recognized as the cause of pregnancy,
but unmarried girls insisted on blaming some article in their diet . 28
Even where the function of the male was understood, sex relationships
were so irregular that it was never a simple matter to determine the
father. Con- sequently the quite primitive mother seldom bothered to
inquire into the paternity of her child; it belonged to her, and she
belonged not to a hus 1 - band but to her father — or her brother — and
the clan; it was with these that she remained, and these were the only
male relatives whom her child would know . 20 The bonds of affection
between brother and sister were usually stronger than between husband
and wife. The husband, in many cases, remained in the family and clan of
his mother, and saw his wife only as a clandestine visitor. Even in
classical civilization the brother was dearer than the husband: it was
her brother, not her husband, that the wife of Intaphemes saved from the
wrath of Darius; it was for her brother, not for her husband, that
Antigone sacrificed herself . 30 “The notion that</p>
<p>32 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>So slight is the relation between father and children in primitive
society that in a great number of tribes the sexes live apart. In
Australia and British New Guinea, in Africa and Micronesia, in Assam and
Burma,</p>
<p>among the Aleuts, Eskimos and Samoyeds, and here and there over the
earth, tribes may still be found in which there is no visible family
life; the men live apart from the women, and visit them only now and
then; even the meals are taken separately. In northern Papua it is not
considered right for a man to be seen associating socially with a woman,
even if she is the mother of his children. In Tahiti “family life is
quite unknown.” Out of this segregation of the sexes come those secret
fraternities — usually of males — which appear everywhere among
primitive races, and serve most often as a refuge against women . 33
They resemble our modem fraternities in another point — their
hierarchical organization.</p>
<p>The simplest form of the family, then, was the woman and her
children, living with her mother or her brother in the clan; such an
arrangement was a natural outgrowth of the animal family of the mother
and her litter, and of the biological ignorance of primitive man. An
alternative early form was “matrilocal marriage”: the husband left his
clan and went to live with the clan and family of his wife, laboring for
her or with her in the service of her parents. Descent, in such cases,
was traced through the female line, and inheritance was through the
mother; sometimes even the kingship passed down through her rather than
through the male . 33 This “mother - right” was not a “matriarchate”— it
did not imply the rule of women over men . 34 Even when property was
transmitted through the woman she had little power over it; she was used
as a means of tracing relationships which, through primitive laxity or
freedom, were otherwise obscure . 35 It- is true that in any system of
society the woman exercises a certain authority, rising naturally out of
her importance in the home, out of her function as the dispenser of
food, and out of the need that the male has of her, and her power to
refuse him. It is also true that there have been, occasionally, women
rulers among some South African tribes; that in the Pelew Islands the
chief did nothing of consequence without the advice of a council of
elder women; that among the Iroquois the squaws had an equal right, with
the men, of speaking and voting in the tribal council ; 35 and that
among the Seneca Indians women held great power, even to the selection
of the chief. But these are rare and exceptional cases. All in all the
position of woman in early societies was one of sub- jection verging
upon slavery. Her periodic disability, her unfamiliarity</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 33</p>
<p>with weapons, the biological absorption of her strength in carrying,
nurs- ing and rearing children, handicapped her in the war of the sexes,
and doomed her to a subordinate status in all but the very lowest and
the very highest societies. Nor was her position necessarily to rise
with the develop- ment of civilization; it was destined to be lower in
Periclean Greece than among the North American Indians; it was to rise
and fall with her strategic importance rather than with the culture and
morals of men.</p>
<p>In the hunting stage she did almost all the work except the
actual</p>
<p>capture of the game. In return for exposing himself to the hardships
and risks of the chase, the male rested magnificently for the greater
part of the year. The woman bore her children abundantly, reared them,
kept the hut or home in repair, gathered food in woods and fields,
cooked, cleaned, and made the clothing and the boots . 37 Because the
men, when the tribe moved, had to be ready at any moment to fight off
attack, they carried nothing but their weapons; the women carried all
the rest. Bush- women were used as servants and beasts of burden; if
they proved too weak to keep up with the march, they were abandoned . 33
When the natives of the Lower Murray saw pack oxen they thought that
these were the wives of the whites . 30 The differences in strength
which now divide the sexes hardly existed in those days, and are now
environmental rather than innate: woman, apart from her biological
disabilities, was almost the equal of man in stature, endurance,
resourcefulness and courage; she was not yet an ornament, a thing of
beauty, or a sexual toy; she was a robust animal, able to perform
arduous work for long hours, and, if necessary, to fight to the death
for her children or her clan. “Women,” said a</p>
<p>chieftain of the Chippewas, “are created for work. One of them
can</p>
<p>draw or carry as much as two men. They also pitch our tents, make our
clothes, mend them, and keep us warm at night. . . . We absolutely
cannot get along without them on a journey. They do everything and cost
only a little; for since they must be forever cooking, they can be
satisfied in lean times by licking their fingers.”“</p>
<p>Most economic advances, in early society, were made by the woman
rather than the man. While for centuries he clung to his ancient ways of
hunting and herding, she developed agriculture near the camp, and those
busy arts of the home which were to become the most important industries
of later days. From the “wool - bearing tree,” as the Greeks called the
cotton plant, the primitive woman rolled thread and made cotton cloth. 4
’ It was she, apparently, who developed sewing, weaving, basketry,
pottery,</p>
<p>34 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP, in</p>
<p>woodworking, and building; and in many cases it was she who carried
on primitive trade.“ It was she who developed the home, slowly adding
man to the list of her domesticated animals, and training him in those
social dispositions and amenities which are the psychological basis and
cement of civilization.</p>
<p>But as agriculture became more complex and brought larger rewards,
the stronger sex took more and more of it into its own hands.“ The</p>
<p>growth of cattle-breeding gave the man a new source of wealth,
stability and power; even agriculture, which must have seemed so prosaic
to the mighty Nimrods of antiquity, was at last accepted by the
wandering male, and the economic leadership which tillage had for a time
given to women was wrested from them by the men. The application to
agri- culture of those very animals that woman had first domesticated
led to her replacement by the male in the control of the fields; the
advance from the hoe to the plough put a premium upon physical strength,
and enabled the man to assert his supremacy. The growth of transmissible
property in cattle and in the products of the soil led to the sexual
subordination of woman, for the male now demanded from her that fidelity
which he thought would enable him to pass on his accumulations to
children pre- sumably his own. Gradually the man had his way: fatherhood
became recognized, and property began to descend through the male;
mother- right yielded to father-right; and the patriarchal family, with
the oldest male at its head, became the economic, legal, political and
moral unit of society. The gods, who had been mostly feminine, became
great bearded patriarchs, with such harems as ambitious men dreamed of
in their solitude.</p>
<p>This passage to the patriarchal — father-ruled — family was fatal to
the position of woman. In all essential aspects she and her children
became the property first of her father or oldest brother, then of her
husband. She was bought in marriage precisely as a slave was bought in
the market. She was bequeathed as property when her husband died; and in
some places (New Guinea, the New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, Fiji,
India, etc.) she was strangled and buried with her dead husband, or was
expected to commit suicide, in order to attend upon him in the other
world.“ The father had now the right to treat, give, sell or lend his
wives and daughters very much as he pleased, subject only to the social
condemnation of other fathers exercising the same rights. While the male
reserved the privilege of extending his sexual favors beyond his home,
the woman — under patri-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 35</p>
<p>archal institutions — was vowed to complete chastity before marriage,
and complete fidelity after it. The double standard was born.</p>
<p>The general subjection of woman which had existed in the hunting</p>
<p>stage, and had persisted, in diminished form, through the period of
mother- right, became now more pronounced and merciless than before.
In</p>
<p>ancient Russia, on the marriage of a daughter, the father struck
her</p>
<p>gently with a whip, and then presented the whip to the bridegroom ,
15 as a sign that her beatings were now to come from a rejuvenated hand.
Even the American Indians, among whom mother-right survived
indefinitely, treated their women harshly, consigned to them all
drudgery, and often called them dogs . 18 Everywhere the fife of a woman
was considered cheaper than that of a man; and when girls were born
there was none of the rejoicing that marked the coming of a male.
Mothers sometimes destroyed their female children to keep them from
misery. In Fiji wives might be sold at pleasure, and the usual price was
a musket . 17 Among some tribes man and wife did not sleep together,
lest the breath of the woman should enfeeble the man; in Fiji it was not
thought proper for a man to sleep regularly at home; in New Caledonia
the wife slept in a shed, while the man slept in the house. In Fiji dogs
were allowed in some of the temples, but women were excluded from all ;
18 such exclusion of women from religious services survives in Islam to
this day. Doubtless woman enjoyed at all times the mastery that comes of
long-continued speech; the men might be rebuffed, harangued, even — now
and then- beaten.“ But all in all the man was lord, the woman was
servant. The Kaffir bought women like slaves, as a form of life-income
insurance; when he had a sufficient number of wives he could rest for
the remainder of his days; they would do all the work for him. Some
tribes of ancient India reckoned the women of a family as part of the
property inheritance, along with the domestic animals ; 50 nor did the
last commandment of Moses dis- tinguish very clearly in this matter.
Throughout negro Africa women hardly differed from slaves, except that
they were expected to provide sexual as well as economic satisfaction.
Marriage began as a form of the law of property, as a part of the
institution of slavery . 61</p>
