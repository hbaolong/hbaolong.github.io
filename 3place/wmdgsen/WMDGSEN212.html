<h4 id="chapter-xxviii">CHAPTER XXVIII</h4>
<p>The Growth of the Church</p>
<p>A.D. 96-305</p>
<p>I. THE CHRISTIANS</p>
<p>T HEY met in private rooms or small chapels, and organized themselves
on the model of the synagogue . 1 Each congregation was called an</p>
<p>ekklesia — t he Greek term for the popular assembly in municipal
govern- ments. Slaves were welcomed, as in the Isiac and Mithraic cults;
no attempt was made to liberate them, but they were comforted by the
promise of a Kingdom in which all could be free. The early converts were
predominantly proletarian, with a sprinkling of the lower middle classes
and an occasional conquest among the rich. Nevertheless, they were far
from being the “dregs of the people,” as Celsus would claim; they lived
for the most part orderly and industrious lives, financed missions, and
raised funds for impoverished Christian communities. Little effort was
made as yet to win over the rural population; these came in last, and it
was in this strange way that their name pagani (villagers, peasants)
came to be applied to the pre-Christian inhabitants of the Mediterranean
states.</p>
<p>Women were admitted to the congregations, and rose to some prominence
in minor roles; but the Church required them to shame the heathen by
lives of modest submission and retirement. They were bidden to come to
worship veiled, for their hair was considered especially seductive, and
even angels might be distracted by it during the service ; 2 Saint
Jerome thought it should be entirely cut off . 3 Christian women were
also to avoid cosmetics and jewelry, and particularly false hair; for
the blessing of the priest, falling upon dead hair from another head,
would hardly know which head to bless . 4 Paul had instructed his
communities sternly:</p>
<p>Women should keep quiet in church. They must take a subordi-</p>
<p>nate place. If they want to find out anything they should ask
their</p>
<p>husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in</p>
<p>church. … A man ought not to wear anything on his head in</p>
<p>church, for he is the image of God and reflects God’s glory,
while</p>
<p>woman is a reflection of man’s glory. For man was not made from</p>
<p>596</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH</p>
<p>woman, but woman from man; and man was not created for woman, but
woman for man. That is why she ought to wear upon her head</p>
<p>something to symbolize her subjection. 5</p>
<p>This was the Judaic and Greek view of woman, not the Roman; perhaps
it represented a reaction against the license into which some women had
debased their growing liberty. We may believe, from these very fulmina-
tions, that despite the lack of jewels and scents, and with the help of
veils, Christian women succeeded in being attractive, and exercised
their ancient powers in their subtle ways. For unmarried or widowed
women the Church found many useful t asks. They were organized as
“sisters,” performed works of administration or charity, and created in
time the divers orders of those nuns whose cheerful kindliness is the
noblest embodiment of Christianity.</p>
<p>Lucian, about 160, described “those imbeciles,” the Christians, as
“dis - daining things terrestrial, and holding these as belonging to all
in common.” 6</p>
<p>Come, now, you rich people, weep aloud and howl over the mis-</p>
<p>eries that shall overtake you! Your wealth has rotted, your clothes
are moth-eaten, your gold and silver are rusted . . . and their rust
will</p>
<p>eat into your very flesh, for you have stored up fire for the last
days.</p>
<p>The wages you have withheld from the laborers who have reaped</p>
<p>your harvests cry aloud, and their cries have reached the ears of the
Lord of Hosts. . . . Has not God chosen the world’s poor to possess</p>
<p>the Kingdom? 10</p>
<p>In that Kingdom, he adds, the rich will wither like flowers under a
scorching sun. 11</p>
<p>An element of communism entered into the custom of the common meal.
As the Greek and Roman associations had met on occasion to dine
together, so the early Christians gathered frequently in the agape or
love feast, usually</p>
<p>59® CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>on a Sabbath evening. The dinner began and ended with prayer and
scrip- tural readings, and the bread and wine were blessed by the
priest. The faith- ful appear to have believed that the bread and wine
were, or represented, the body and blood of Christ ; 12 the worshipers
of Dionysus, Attis, and Mithras had entertained like beliefs at the
banquets where they ate the magic embodi- ments or symbols of their gods
. 13 The final ritual o f the agape was the “kiss of love.” In some
congregations this was given only by men to men, and by women to women;
in others this hard restriction was not enforced. Many participants
discovered an untheological delight in the pleasant ceremony; and
Tertullian and others denounced it as having led to sexual indulgences .
14 The Church recommended that the lips should not be opened in kissing,
and that the kiss should not be repeated if it gave pleasure . 15 In the
third century the agape gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Despite such episodes, and the diatribes of preachers calling their
con- gregations to perfection, we may accept the old belief that the
morals of the early Christians were a reproving example to the pagan
world. After the weakening of the ancient faiths had removed their frail
support from the moral life, and the attempt of Stoicism at an almost
natural ethic had failed with all but the best of men, a new
supernatural ethic accomplished, at whatever cost to the free and
dissolvent intellect, the task of regulating the jungle instincts of man
into a viable morality. The hope of the coming Kingdom carried with it
belief in a Judge who saw every act, knew man’s every thought, and could
not be eluded or deceived. To this divine sur- veillance was added
mutual scrutiny: in these little groups sin could with difficulty find a
hiding place; and the community publicly reprimanded those members who
had violated the new moral code with insufficient secrecy. Abortion and
infanticide, which were decimating pagan society, were forbidden to
Christians as the equivalents of murder ; 10 in many instances
Christians rescued exposed infants, baptized them, and brought them up
with the aid of the community fund . 17 The Church forbade with less
success the attendance of Christians at the theater or the public games,
and their participation in the festivities of pagan holidays . 18 In
general, Christianity continued and exaggerated the moral sternness of
the embattled Jews. Celi- bacy and virginity were recommended as ideal;
marriage was tolerated only as a check on promiscuity and as a
ridiculous means of continuing the race, but husband and wife were
encouraged to refrain from sexual relations . 19 Divorce was allowed
only when a pagan wished to annul a marriage with a convert. The
remarriage of widows or widowers was discountenanced, and homosexual
practices were condemned with an earnestness rare in antiquity. “So far
as sex is concerned,” said Tertullian, “the Christian is content with t
he woman.” 20</p>
<p>5 99</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH</p>
<p>Much of this difficult code was predicated on the early return of
Christ. As that hope faded, the voice of the flesh rose again, and
Christian morals were relaxed; an anonymous pamphlet. The Shepherd of
Hermas ( ca . no), inveighed against the reappearance, among Christians,
of avarice, dishonesty, rouge, dyed hair, painted eyelids, drunkenness,
and adultery . 21 Nevertheless, the general picture of Christian morals
in this period is one of piety, mutual loyalty, marital fidelity, and a
quiet happiness in the possession of a confident faith. The younger
Pliny was compelled to report to Trajan that the Chris- tians led
peaceful and exemplary lives . 22 Galen described them as “so far
advanced in self-discipline and . . . intense desire to attain moral
excellence that they are in no way inferior to true philosophers.” 23
The sense of sin took on a new intensity with the belief that all
mankind had been tainted by Adam’s fall, and tha t soon the world would
end in a judgment of eternal punishment or reward. Many Christians were
absorbed in the effort to come clean to that dread assize; they saw a
lure of Satan in every pleasure of the senses, denounced the “world and
the flesh,” and sought to subdue desire with fasts and varied
chastisements. They looked with suspicion upon music, white bread,
foreign wines, warm baths, or shaving the beard — which seemed to flout
the evident will of God . 24 Even for the ordinary Christian, life took
on a more somber tint than paganism had ever given it except in the
occa- sional “apotropaic” appeasement of subterranean deities. The
serious temper of the Jewish Sabbath was transferred to the Christian
Sunday that replaced it in the second century.</p>
<p>On that dies Domini, or Lord’s Day, the Christians assembled for
their weekly ritual. Their clergy read from the Scriptures, led them in
prayer, and preached sermons of doctrinal instruction, moral
exhortation, and sec- tarian controversy. In the early days members of
the congregation, especially women, were allowed to “prophesy”— i.e., to
“speak forth,” in trance or ecstasy, words to which meaning could be
given only by pious interpreta- tion. When these performances conduced
to ritual fever and theological chaos, the Church discouraged and
finally suppressed them. At every step the clergy found itself obliged
not to generate superstition, but to control it.</p>
<p>By the close of the second century these weekly ceremonies had taken
the form of the Christian Mass. Based partly on the Judaic Temple
service, partly on Greek mystery rituals of purification, vicarious
sacrifice, and participation, through communion, in the death-overcoming
powers of the deity, the Mass grew slowly into a rich congeries of
prayers, psalms, read- ings, sermon, antiphonal recitations, and, above
all, that symbolic atoning sacrifice of the “Lamb of God” which
replaced, in Christianity, the bloody offerings of older faiths. The
bread and wine which these cults had con- sidered as gifts placed upon
the altar before the god were now conceived as</p>
<p>600 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXV1I1</p>
<p>changed by the priestly act of consecration into the body and blood
of Christ, and were presented to God as a repetition of the
self-immolation of Jesus on the cross. Then, in an intense and moving
ceremony, the worshipers partook of the very life and substance of their
Saviour. It was a conception long sanctified by time; the pagan mind
needed no schooling to receive it; by embodying it in the “mystery of
the Mass,” Christianity became the last and greatest of the mystery
religions. It was a custom lowly in origin 25 and beautiful in
development; its adoption was part of the profound wisdom with which the
Church adjusted itself to the symbols of the age and the needs of her
people; no other ceremony could have so heartened the essen- tially
solitary soul, or so strengthened it to face a hostile woijd.*</p>
<p>The eucharist, or “blessing” of the bread and wine, was one of the
seven Chri stian “sacraments”— sacred rituals believed to convey divine
grace. Here, too, the Church used the poetry of symbols to console and
dignify the life of man, to renew at each step in the human odyssey the
fortifying touch of deity. In the first century we find only three
ceremonies conceived of as sacraments — baptism, communion, and holy
orders; but already, in the cus- toms of the congregations, the germs of
the rest were present. It was appar- ently the practice of the early
Christians to add to bapt ism an “imposition of hands,” whereby the
apostle or priest introduced the Holy Spirit into the believer; 28 in
the course of time this action was separated from baptism and became the
sacrament of confirmation. 25 As the baptism of adults was gradually
replaced by the baptism of infants, men felt the need of some later
spiritual cleansing; public acknowledgment of sin passed into private
confession to the priest, who claimed to have received from the apostles
or their episcopal successors the right to “bind and loose”— to impose
penances and pardon sins. 30 The sacrament of penance was an institution
capable of abuse through the ease of forgiveness; but it gave the sinner
strength to reform, and spared anxious souls the neuroses of remorse. In
these centuries marriage was still a civil ceremony; but by adding and
requiring her sanction the Church lifted it from the level of a passing
contract to the sanctity of an inviolable vow. By the year 200 the
laying on of hands took the added form of “holy orders,” by which the
bishops assumed the exclusive right to ordain priests capable of
administering the sacraments validly. Finally the Church derived from
the Epistle of James (v, 14) the sacrament of “extreme unction,” or last
blessing, by which t he priest anointed the sense organs and extremities
of a dying Christian, cleansed him again of sin, and prepared him to
meet his God. It would be the shallowest folly to judge</p>
<p>• In the mysteries of Mithras the worshipers were offered consecrated
bread and water. 26 The conquistadores were shocked to find similar
rites among the Indians of Mexico and Peru. 27</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVlIl) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 6oi</p>
<p>these ceremonies in terms of their literal claims; in terms of human
encourage- ment and inspiration they were the wisest medicaments of the
soul. Christian burial was the culminating honor of the Christian life.
Since the new faith proclaimed the resurrection of the body as well as
of the soul, every care was taken of the dead; a priest officiated at
the interment, and each corpse received an individual tomb. About the
year i oo the Christians of Rome, following Syrian and Etruscan
traditions, began to bury their dead in catacombs — probably not for
concealment but for the economy of space and expense. Workmen dug long
subterranean passages at various levels, and the dead were laid in
superimposed crypts along the sides of these galleries. Pagans and Jews
practiced the same method, perhaps as a con- venience for burial
societies. Some of the passages seem purposely devious, and suggest
their use as hiding places in persecutions. After the triumph of
Christianity the custom of catacomb burial died out; the crypts became
objects of veneration and pilgrimage; by the ninth century they had been
blocked up and forgotten, and only accident discovered them in 1578.</p>
<p>What remains of early Christian art is for the most part preserved in
the frescoes and reliefs of the catacombs. Here, about 1 80, appear the
symbols that were to be so prominent in Christianity: the dove,
representing the soul freed from the prison of this life; the phoenix,
rising out of the ashes of death; the palm branch, announcing victory;
the olive branch, offering peace; and the fish, chosen because the Greek
word for it, i-ch-th-u~s, formed the initials of the phrase lesous
Christos theou uios soter — “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour.” Here
also is the famous theme of the Good Shepherd, frankly modeled on a
Tanagra statue of Mercury carrying a goat. Occasionally these designs
catch a certain Pompeian grace, as in the flowers, vines, and birds that
decorated the ceiling of St. Domitilla’s tomb; usually they are the
undistinguished work of minor craftsmen corrupting with Oriental
obscurity the clearness of classic line. Christianity was in these
centuries so absorbed in the other world that it had little interest in
adorning this one. It continued the Judaic aversion to statuary,
confused imagery with idolatry, and condemned sculpture and painting as
too often glorying in the nude; consequently, as Christianity grew,
plastic art de- clined. Mosaic was more popular; the walls and floors of
basilicas and baptistries were inlaid with tesselated foliage and
flowers, the Paschal Lamb, and pictures from the Testaments. Similar
scenes were carved in rough relief on sarcophagi. Meanwhile architects
were adapting the Greco-Roman basilica to the needs of Christian
worship. The small temples that had housed the pagan gods could offer no
models for churches designed to enclose whole congregations; the
spacious nave and aisles of the basilica lent themselves to this
purpose, and its apse seemed naturally destined to become the sanctuary.
In these new shrines Christian music inherited diffidently the Greek
notation, modes, and scales. Many</p>
<p>&lt;502 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>theologians frowned upon die singing of women in church, or, indeed,
in any public place; for a woman’s voice might arouse some profane
interest in the ever</p>
<p>All in all, no more attractive religion has ever been presented to
man- kind. It offered itself without restriction to all individuals,
classes, and na- tions; it was not limited to one people, like Judaism,
nor to the freemen of one state, like the official cults of Greece and
Rome. By making all men heirs of Christ’s vic tory over death,
Christianity announced the basic equality of men, and made transiently
trivial all differences of earthly degree. To the miserable, maimed,
bereaved, disheartened, and humiliated it brought the new virtue of
compassion, and an ennobling dignity; it gave them the inspiring figure,
story, and ethic of Christ; it brightened their lives with the hope of
the coming Kingdom, and of endless happiness beyond the grave. To even
the greatest sinners it promised forgiveness, and their full acceptance
into the community of the saved. To minds harassed with the insoluble
problems of origin and destiny, evil and suffering, it brought a system
of divinely revealed doctrine in which the simplest soul could find
mental rest. To men and women imprisoned in the prose of poverty and
toil it brought the poetry of the sacraments and the Mass, a ritual that
made every maior event of life a vital scene in the moving drama of God
and man. Into the moral vacuum of a dying paganism, into the coldness of
Stoicism and the corruption of Epicureanism, into a world sick of
brutality, cruelty, oppres- sion, and sexual chaos, into a pacified
empire that seemed no longer to need the masculine virtues or the gods
of war, it brought a new morality of brotherhood, kindliness, decency,
and peace.</p>
<p>So molded to men’s wants, the new faith spread with fluid readiness.
Nearly every convert, with the ardor of a revolutionary, made himself an
office of propaganda. The roads, rivers, and coasts, the trade routes
and fa cilities, of the Empire largely determined the lines of the
Church’s growth: eastward from Jerusalem to Damascus, Edessa, Dura,
Seleucia, and</p>
<p>Ctesiphon; southward through Bostra and Petra into Arabia; westward
through Syria into Egypt; northward through Antioch into Asia Minor and
Armenia; across the Aegean from Ephesus and Troas to Corinth and
Thessalonica; over the Egnatian Way to Dyrrhachium; across the Adriatic
to Brundisium, or through Scylla and Charybdis to Puteoli and Rome;
through Sicily and Egypt to north Africa; over the Mediterranean or the
Alps to Spain and Gaul, and thence to Britain: slowly the cross followed
the fasces, and the Roman eagles made straight the way for Christ.
Asia</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVTIl) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 603</p>
<p>Minor was in these centuries the stronghold of Christianity; by 300
the majority of the population in Ephesus and Smyrna were Christians. 32
The new faith fared well in north Africa: Carthage and Hippo became
leading centers of Christian learning and dispute; here rose the great
Fathers of the Latin Church — Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine; here the
Latin text of the Mass, and the first Latin translation of the New
Testament, took form. In Rome the Christian community numbered some
100,000 by the end of the third century; it was able to send financial
aid to other congregations; long since it had claimed for its bishop the
supreme authority in the Church. Altogether we may count a fourth of the
population in the East as Christian by 300, and a twentieth in the West.
“Aden proclaim,” said Tertullian ( ca .</p>
<ol start="200" type="1">
<li>, “that the state is beset with us. Every age, condition, and rank
is coming over to us. We are only of yesterday, but already we fill the
world.” 33</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE CONFLICT OF CREEDS</li>
</ol>
<p>It would have been surprising if, in the multitude of relatively
independ- ent centers of Christianity, subject to different traditions
and environments, there had failed to develop a diversity of customs and
creeds. Greek Chris- tianity in particular was destined to a flood of
heresies by the metaphysical and argumentative habits of the Greek mind.
Christianity can be understood only in the perspective of these
heresies, for even in defeating them it took something of their color
and form.</p>
<p>One faith united the scattered congregations: that Christ was the son
of God, that he would .return to establish Ills Kingdom on earth, and
that all who believed in him would at the Last Judgment be rewarded with
eternal bliss. But Christians differed as to the date of the second
advent. When Nero died and Titus demolished the Temple, and again when
Hadrian destroyed Jerusalem, many Christians hailed these calamities as
signs of the second coming. When chaos threatened the Empire at the
close of the second cen- tury, Tertullian and others thought that the
end of the world was at hand; 34 a Syrian bishop led his flock into the
desert to meet Christ halfway, and a bishop in Pontus disorganized the
life of his community by announcing that Christ would return within a
year. 35 As all signs failed, and Christ did not come, wiser Christians
sought to soften the disappointment by reinterpreting the date of his
return. He would come in a thousand years, said an epistle ascribed to
Barnabas; 30 he would come, said the most cautious, when the
“generation” or race of the Jews was quite extinct, or when the Gospel
had been preached to all gentiles; or, said the Gospel of John, he would
send</p>
<p>604 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>in his stead the Holy Spirit or Paraclete. Finally the Kingdom was
trans- ferred from earth to heaven, from the years of our life to a
paradise beyond the grave. Even the belief in the millennium — in the
return of Jesus after a thousand years — was discouraged by the Church,
and was ultimately con- demned. The faith in the second advent had
established Christianity; the hope of heaven preserved it.*</p>
<p>Aside from these basic tenets, the followers of Christ, in the first
three cen- turies, divided into a hundred creeds. We should misjudge the
function of his- tory — which is to illuminate the present through the
past — were we to detail the varieties of religious belief that sought
and failed to capture the growing Church, and which the Church had to
brand, one after another, as disintegrating heresies. Gnosticism — the
quest of godlike knowledge ( gnosis ) through mystic means — was not a
heresy so much as a rival; it antedated Christianity, and had pro-
claimed theories of a Soter, or Savior, before Christ was bom. 37 That
same Simon Magus of Samari a, whom Peter rebuked for “simony,” was
probably the author of a Great Exposition which gathered together a maze
of Oriental notions about the complicated steps that could lead the
human mind to a divine comprehension of all things. In Alexandria the
Orphic, Neo-Pythagorean, and Neoplatonist traditions, fusing with the
Logos philosophy of Philo, stirred Basilides (117), Valentinus (160),
and others to form weird systems of divine emanations and personified
“aeons” of the world. In Edessa Bardesanes (2 00) created literary
Syriac by describing these aeons in prose and verse. In Gaul the Gnostic
Marcus offered to reveal to women the secrets of their guardian angels;
his revelations were flattering, and he accepted their persons as his
reward. 38</p>
<p>The greatest of the early heretics was not quite a Gnostic, but was
influenced by their mythology. About 140 Marcion, a rich youth of
Sinope, came to Rome vowing to complete Paul’s work of divorcing
Christianity from Judaism. The Christ of the Gospels, said Marcion, had
described as his father a God of tender- ness, forgiveness, and love;
but the Yahveh of the Old Testament was a harsh god of unrelenting
justice, tyranny, and war; this Yahveh could not be the father of the
gentle Christ. What good god, asked Marcion, would have condemned all
mankind to misery for eating an apple, or desiring knowledge, or loving
woman? Yahveh exists, and is the creator of the world; but he made the
flesh and bones of man from matter, and therefore left man’s soul impris
oned in an evil frame. To release the soul of man a greater god sent his
son to earth; Christ appeared,</p>

Christianity, interpret</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVin) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 6o thirty years of age, in a
phantasmal, unreal body, and by his death won for good men the privilege
of a purely spiritual resurrection. The good, said Marcion, are those
who, following Paul, renounce Yahveh and the Jewish Law, reject the
Hebrew Scriptures, shun marriage and all sensual enjoyment, and overcome
the flesh by a stern asceticism. To propagate these ideas Marcion issued
a New Testament composed of Luke’s Gospel and the letters of Paul. The
Church excommunicated him, and returned to him the substantial sum that
he had pre- sented to it on coming to Rome.</p>
<p>While the Gnostic and Marcionite sects were spreading rapidly in both
East and West, a new heresiarch appeared in Mysia. About 156 Montanus
denounced the increasing worldliness of Christians and the growing
autocracy of bishops in the Church; he demanded a return to primitive
Christian simplicity and austerity, and a restored right of prophecy, or
inspired speech, to the members of the congregations. Two women,
Priscilla and Maximilla, took him at his word and fell into religious
trances; and their utterances became the living oracles of the sect.
Montanus himself prophesied with such eloquent ecstasy that his Phrygian
followers — with the same religious enthusiasm that had once begotten
Dionysus — hailed him as the Paraclete promised by Christ. He announced
that the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand, and that the New Jerusalem of
the Apoca- lypse would soon descend from heaven upon a neighboring
plain. To the pre- destined spot he led so large a host that some towns
were depopulated. As in early Christian days, marriage and parentage
were neglected, goods were com- munistically shared, and an absorbed
asceticism anxiously prepared the soul for Christ. 30 When, about 190,
the Roman proconsul Antonius persecuted Chris- tianity in Asia Minor,
hundreds of Montanists, eager for paradise, crowded before his tribunal
and asked for martyrdom. He could not accommodate them all; some he
executed; but most of them he dismissed with the words: “Miserable</p>
<p>Of minor heresies there was no end. The Encratites abstained from
meat, wine, and sex; the Abstinents practiced self-mortification and
condemned marriage as a sin; the Docetists taught that Christ’s body was
merely a phantom, not hu - man flesh; the Theodotians considered him
only a man; the Adoptionists and the followers of Paul of Samosata
thought that he had been born a man, but had achieved divinity through
moral perfection; the Modalists, Sabellians, and Mo- narchians
recognized in the Father and the Son only one person, the Monoph- ysites
only one nature, the Monothelites only one will. The Church overcame
them by its superior organization, its doctrinal tenacity, and its
better under- standing of the ways and needs of men.</p>
<p>In the third century a new danger rose in the East. At the coronation
of Shapur I (242) a young Persian mystic, Mani of Ctesiphon, proclaimed
himself a Messiah sent upon earth by the True God to reform the
religious and moral</p>
<p>606 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>life of mankind. Borrowing from Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, Judaism,
and Gnosticism, Mnni divided the world into rival realms of Darkness and
Light; the earth belonged to the kingdom of Darkness, and Satan had
created man. Nevertheless, the angels of the God of Light had
surreptitiously introduced some elements of light into humanity — mind,
intelligence, reason. Even woman, said Mani, has in her some sparks of
light; but woman is Satan’s masterpiece, his chief agent in tempting man
to sin. If a man will refrain from sex, idolatry, and sorcery, and lead
an ascetic life of vegetarianism and fasting, the elements of light in
him can overcome his Satanic impulses, and lead him, like a kindly
light, to salvation. After thirty years of successful preaching Mani was
crucified at the suggestion of the Magian clergy, and his skin, stuffed
with straw, was hung from one of Susa’s gates. Martyrdoms enflamed the
faith to wild enthusiasm; Manicheism spread into western Asia and north
Africa, won Augustine for ten years, survived the persecutions of
Diocletian and the conquests of Islam, and maintained a declining life
for a thousand years till the coming of Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>The old religions still claimed a majority of the Empire’s
population. Judaism gathered its impoverished exiles into scattered
synagogues, and poured its piety into its Talmuds. The Syrians continued
to worship their Baals under Hellenistic names, and the Egyptian priests
tended faithfully their zoological pantheon. Cybele, Isis, and Mithras
retained their addicts till the close of the fourth century; under
Aurelian a modified Mithraism captured the Roman state. Votive offerings
to the classical divinities still came to the temples, initiates and
candidates journeyed to Eleusis, and throughout the Empire aspiring
citizens performed the motions of the im- perial cult. But life had gone
out of the classic creeds. They no longer aroused, except here and
there, the warm devotion that makes a religion live. It was not that the
Greeks and the Romans abandoned these faiths, once so lovely or austere;
they abandoned rather the will to live, and by exces- sive family
limitation, or physiological exhaustion, or devastating wars, so reduced
their own number that the temples lost their cultivators step by step
with the farms.</p>
<p>About the year 178, while Aurelius fought the Marcomanni on the</p>
<p>Danube, paganism made a lusty attempt to defend itself against
Christianity. We know of it only through Origen’s book Against Celsus,
and the quota - tions recklessly mad e there from Celsus’ True Word.
This second Celsus in our story was a gentleman of the world rather than
a speculative philosopher; he felt that the civilization which he
enjoyed was bound up with the old Roman faith; and he resolved to defend
that faith by attacking the Chris- tianity that was now its most
challenging enemy. He made so intimate a study of the new religion that
the learned Origen was astounded by his erudition. Celsus assailed the
credibility of the Scriptures, the character</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 607</p>
<p>of Yahveh, the importance of Christ’s miracles, the incompatibility
of Christ’s death with his omnipotent divinity. He ridiculed the
Christian belief in a final conflagration, the Last Judgment, and the
resurrection of the body:</p>
<p>It is silly to suppose that when God, like a cook, brings the
fire,</p>
<p>the rest of mankind will be roasted, and only the Christians will
re-</p>
<p>main — not merely the living ones, but those who died long ago,
rising from the earth with the identical flesh they had before. Really,
it is</p>
<p>the hope of worms! … It is only the simpletons, the ignoble, the</p>
<p>senseless — slaves and women and children — whom Christians can per-
suade — wool-dressers, and cobblers and fullers, the most uneducated and
common men, whoever is a sinner … or a godforsaken fool . 42</p>
<p>Celsus was alarmed by the spread of Christianity, by its scornful
hostility to paganism, military service, and the state; how was the
Empire to protect itself from the barbarians prowling on every frontier
if its inhabitants suc- cumbed to so pacifistic a philosophy? A good
citizen, he thought, should conform to the religion of his country and
his time without public criticism of its absurdities; these did not much
matter; what counted was a unifying faith supporting moral character and
civic loyalty. Then, forgetting the insults he had heaped upon them, he
appealed to the Christians to come back to the old gods, to worship the
guardian genius of the emperor, and to join in the defense of the
imperiled state. No one paid much attention to him; pagan literature
does not mention him; he would have been quite forgotten had not Origen
undertaken to refute him. Constantine was wiser than Celsus, and knew
that a dead faith could not salvage Rome.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PLOTINUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, Celsus was out of step with his time; he asked men to
behave like gentlemen skeptics when they were withdrawing from a society
that enslaved so many of them into a mystic world that made every man a
god. That consciousness of supersensible powers which is the foundation
of religion was prevailing universally over the materialism and
determinism of a prouder age. Philosophy was abandoning the
interpretation of that sense’ experience which is the realm of science,
and was devoting itself to a study of the unseen world. Neo-Pythagoreans
and Neoplatonists developed Pythagoras’ theory of transmigration, and
Plato’s contemplation of the Divine Ideas, into an asceticism that
sought to sharpen spiritual perception by starving the physical senses,
and to reclimb by self-purification the steps by which the soul had been
degraded from heaven into man.</p>

<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIII</p>
<p>Plotinus was the culmination of this mystic theosophy. Bom at
Lycopolis in 203, he was a Coptic Egyptian with a Roman name and a Greek
educa- tion. In his twenty-eighth year he discovered philosophy, passed
unsatisfied from teacher to teacher, and found at last, in Alexandria,
the man he sought. Ammonius Saccas, a Christian converted to paganism,
was attempting to reconcile Christianity and Platonism, as his pupil
Origen would do. After studying under Ammonius for ten years, Plotinus
joined a Persia-bound army in the hope of learning the wisdom of the
Magi and the Brahmans at first hai He reached Mesopotamia, turned back
to Antioch, went to Rome (244), and remained there till his death. His
school of philosophy became so fashionable that the Emperor Gallienus
made him a court favorite, and agreed to help him establish in Campania
an ideal Platonopolis, to be gov- erned on the principles of the
Republic. Gallienus later withdrew his con- sent, perhaps to spare
Plotinus an ignominious failure.</p>
<p>Plotinus restored the repute of philosophy by living like a saint
amid the luxuries of Rome. He had no care for his body; indeed, says
Porphyry, “he was ashamed that his soul had a body.” 43 He refused to
sit for his portrait, on the ground that his body was the least
important part of him — a hint to art to seek the soul. He ate no meat
and little bread, was simple in his habits, kindly in his ways. He
avoided all sexual relations, but did not con- demn them. His modesty
befitted a man who saw the part in the perspective of the whole. When
Origen attended his class, Plotinus blushed and wished to end his
lecture, saying, “The zest dies down when the speaker feels that</p>
<p>Plotinus was an idealist who graciously recognized the existence of
mat- ter. But matter by itself, he argued, is only the formless
possibility of form. Every form that matter takes is given it by its
inward energy or soul</p>
<p>(psyche). Nature is the total of energy or soul, producing the
totality of forms in the world. The lower reality does not produce the
higher; the higher being, soul, produces the lower — embodied form. The
growth of the individual man from his beginnings in the womb, through
the slow formation of organ after organ to full maturity is the work of
the psyche</p>

<p>or vital prinoiple within him; the body is gradually molded by the
longings and directives of the soul. Everything has soul — an inward
energy creating outward form. Matter is evil only insofar as it has not
received mature form; it is an arrested development; and evil is the
possibility of good.</p>
<p>We know matter only through idea — through sensation, perception,
thought; what we call matter is (as Hume would say) only a bundle of
ideas; at most it is an elusive hypothetical something pressing against
our nerve ends (Mill’s “permanent possibility of sensation”). Ideas are
not material; the notion of extension in space is obviously inapplicable
to them. The capacity to have and use ideas is reason (nous ) ; this is
the peak of the human triad of body, soul, and mind. Reason is
determined insofar as it depends upon sensation; it is free insofar as
it is the highest form of the creative, molding soul.</p>
<p>The body is both the organ and the prison of the soul. The soul knows
that it is a higher kind of reality than the body; it feels its kinship
with some vaster soul, some cosmic creative life and power; and in the
perfection of thought it aspires to join again that supreme spiritual
reality from which it appears to have fallen in some primeval
catastrophe and disgrace. Plotinus here surrenders discursively to the
Gnosticism that he professes to reject, and describes the descent of the
soul through various levels from heaven to corporeal man; generally he
prefers the Hindu notion that the soul trans- migrates from lower to
higher, or from higher to lower, forms of life accord- ing to its
virtues and vices in each incarnation. Sometimes he is playfully
Pythagorean: those who have loved music too much will become song- birds
in their next avatar, and overspeculative philosophers will be trans-
formed into eagles / 8 The more developed the soul is the more
persistently it seeks its divine source, like a child strayed from its
parent, or a wanderer longing for home. If it is capable of virtue, or
true love, or devotion to the Muses, or patient philosophy, it will find
the ladder down which it came, and will climb it to its God. Let the
soul, then, purify itself, let it desire the unseen essence
passionately, let it lose the world in meditation; suddenly, perhaps in
some moment when all the noise of the senses is stilled, and matter
ceases to pound on the gates of mind, the soul will feel itself absorbed
in the ocean of being, the spiritual and final reality. (“Sometimes,”
wrote</p>
<p>The soul will see divinity as far as it is lawful. . . . And she will
see</p>
<p>herself illuminated, full of intellectual light; or, rather, she will
per-</p>
<p>ceive herself to be a pure light, unburdened, agile, and becoming</p>
<p>god . 47</p>
<p>&lt;5lO CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>But what is God? “He” too is a triad— of unity (hen), reason (nous),
and soul (psyche). “Beyond Being there is the One”: 48 through the
seeming chaos of mundane multiplicity runs a unifying life. We know
almost nothing of it except its existence; any positive adjective or
prejudiced pronoun applied to it would be an unwarrantable limitation;
we may only call it One and First, and Good as the object of our supreme
desire. Emanating from this Unity is the World Reason, corresponding to
Plato’s Ideas,</p>
<p>the formative models and ruling laws of things; they are, so to
speak, the thoughts of God, the Reason in the One, the order and
rationality of the world. Since these Ideas persist while matter is a
kaleidoscope of passing shapes, they are the only true or enduring
reality. But Unity and Reason, though they hold the universe together,
do not create it; this function is performed by the third aspect of the
godhead — the vitalizing principle that fills all things and gives them
their power and predestined form. Every- thing, from atoms to planets,
has an activating soul, which is itself a part of the World-Soul; every
Atman is Brahman. The individual soul is eternal only as vitality or
energy, not as a distinct character . 49 Immortality is not the survival
of personality; it is the absorption of the soul in deathless things .
60</p>
<p>Virtue is the movement of the soul toward God. Beauty is not mere
har- mony and proportion, as Plato and Aristotle thought, but the living
soul or unseen divinity in things; it is the predominance of soul over
body, of form over matter, of reason over things; and art is the
translation of this rational or spiritual beauty into another medium.
The soul can be trained to rise from the pursuit of beauty in material
or human forms to seeking it in the hidden soul in Nature and her laws,
in science and the subtle order that it reveals, finally in the divine
Unity that gathers all things, even striv- ing and conflicting things,
into a sublime and marvelous harmony . 51 In the end beauty and virtue
are one — the unity and co-operation of the part with the whole.</p>
<p>Withdraw into yourself and look. And if you do not find yourself</p>
<p>beautiful, yet act as docs the creator of a statue … he cuts away</p>
<p>here, he smooths there, he makes this line lighter, the other
purer,</p>
<p>until a lovely face has grown upon his work. So do you also: cut</p>
<p>away all that is excessive, straighten all that is crooked . . . and
never cease chiseling your statue until . . . you see the perfect
goodness</p>
<p>established in the stainless shrine . 62</p>
<p>We feel in this philosophy the same spiritual atmosphere as in
contem- porary Christianity — the withdrawal of tender minds from civic
interest to religion, a flight from the state to God. It was no accident
that Plotinus and Origen were fellow pupils and friends, and that
Clement developed a</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 6ll</p>
<p>Christian Platonism at Alexandria. Plotinus is the last of the great
pagan philosophers; and like Epictetus and Aurelius, he is a Christian
without Christ. Christianity accepted nearly every line of him, and many
a page of Augustine echoes the ecstasy of the supreme mystic. Through
Philo, John, Plotinus, and Augustine, Plato conquered Aristotle, and
entered into the profoundest theology of the Church. The gap between
philosophy and religion was closing, and reason for a thousand years
consented to be the handmaiden of theology.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH</li>
</ol>
<p>The Church now won to its support some of the finest minds in the Em-
pire. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, began the powerful dynasty of the
post- apostolic “Fathers,” who gave a philosophy to Christianity, and
overwhelmed its enemies with argument. Condemned to be thrown to the
beasts for refus- ing to abjure his faith (108), Justin composed on his
way to Rome several letters whose hot devotion reveals the spirit in
which Christians could go to their death:</p>
<p>I give injunctions to all men that I am dying willingly for God’s</p>
<p>sake, if you do not hinder it. I beseech you, be not an
unseasonable</p>
<p>kindness to me. Syffer me to be eaten by the beasts, through whom I
can attain to God. . . . Rather entice the wild beasts that they may</p>
<p>become my tomb, and leave no trace of my body, that when I fall</p>
<p>asleep I be not burdensome to any. … I long for the beasts that
are</p>
<p>prepared for me. . . . Let there come upon me fire and cross
〔cruci-</p>
<p>fixion〕, struggles with wild beasts, cutting and tearing asunder,
rack- ings of bones, mangling of limbs, crushing of my whole body,
and</p>
<p>cruel tortures of the devil, if so I may attain to Jesus Christ!
63</p>
<p>Quadratus, Athenagoras, and many others wrote “Apologies” for
Christianity, usually addressed to the emperor. Minucius Felix, in an
almost Ciceronian dia- logue, allowed his Caecilius to defend paganism
ably, but made his Octavius answer him so courteously that Caecilius was
almost persuaded to be a Chris- tian. Justin of Samaria, coming to Rome
in the reign of Antoninus, opened there a school of Christian
philosophy, and, in two eloquent “Apologies,” sought to convi nce the
Emperor, and “Verissimus the Philosopher,” that Christians were loyal
citizens, paid their taxes promptly, and might, under friendly
treatment, become a valuable support to the state. For some years, he
taught unmolested; but the sharpness of his tongue made him enemies, and
in 166 a rival philosopher prodded the authorities to arrest him and six
of his followers, and put them all to death. Twenty years later
Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, struck a powerful blow</p>
<p>6 12 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>for the unity of the Church in his Adversus Haereses, a blast at all
heretics. The only way of preventing Christianity from disintegrating
into a thousand sects, said Irenacus, was for all Christians to accept
humbly one doctrinal au- thority — the decrees of the episcopal councils
of the Church.</p>
<p>The doughtiest fighter for Christianity in this period was Quintus
Sep- timius Tertullianus of Carthage. Born there about 160, the son of a
Roman centurion, he studied rhetoric in the same school that trained
Apuleius; then for years he practiced law at Rome. Midway in life he was
converted to Christianity, married a Christian, renounced all pagan
pleasures, and (says Jerome) was ordained a priest. All the arts and
tricks that he had learned from rhetoric and law were now put at the
service of Christian apologetics, enhanced by a convert’s ardor. Greek
Christianity was theological, meta - physical, mystical; Tertullian made
Latin Christianity ethical, juristic, prac- tical. He had the vigor and
virulence of Cicero, the satirical scurrility of Juvenal, and sometimes
he could, rival Tacitus in concentrating acid in a phrase. Irenaeus had
written in Greek; with Minucius and Tertullian Chris- tian literature in
the West became Latin, and Latin literature became Christian.</p>
<p>In the year 197, while Roman magistrates in Carthage were trying
Chris- tians on charges of disloyalty, Tertullian addressed to an
imaginary court the most eloquent of his works — the Apologeticus. He
assured the Romans that Chr istians “are always praying for all
emperors, for … a safe dynasty, brave armies, a faithful Senate, and a
quiet world.” 84 He extolled the grandeur of monotheism, and found
premonitions of it in pre-Christian writers. O testimonium animae
naturaliter Christianae! he cried in a happy phrase — “Behold the
witness of the soul, by its very nature Christian!” 55 A year later,
passing with strange celerity from persuasive defense to ferocious
attack, he issued De Spectaculis, a scornful description of the Roman
theaters as citadels of obscenity, and of the amphitheaters as the acme
of man’s in - humanity to man. And he concluded with a bitter
threat:</p>
<p>Other spectacles will come — that last eternal Day of Judgment</p>
<p>. . . when all this old world and its generations shall be consumed
in one fire. How vast the spectacle will be on that day! How I shall</p>
<p>marvel, laugh, rejoice, and exult, seeing so many kings — supposedly
received into heaven — groaning in the depths of darkness! — and the
magistrates who persecuted the name of Jesus melting in fiercer flames
than they ever kindled . . . against the Christians! — sages and
phi-</p>
<p>losophers blushing before their disciples as they blaze together! . .
. and tragic actors now more than ever vocal in their own tragedy,

<p>players lither of limb by far in the fire, and charioteers burning
red</p>
<p>on the wheel of flame! 86</p>
<p>Such unhealthy intensity of imagination does not make for orthodoxy.
As Tertullian aged, the same energy that in his youth had courted
pleasure now turned into a fierce denunciation of every consolation but
those of faith and hope. He addressed woman in the coarsest terms as
“the gate by which the demon enters,” and told her that “it is on your
acco unt that Jesus Christ died.” 87 Once he loved philosophy, and had
written works like De Aniirn, applying Stoic metaphysics to
Christianity; now he renounced all reasoning independent of revelation,
and rejoiced in the incredibility of his creed. “God’s son died: it is
believable precisely because it is absurd 〔ineptum 〕 . He was buried
and rose again: it is certain because it is impos - sible.” 88 Sinking
into a morose puritanism, Tertullian in his fifty -eighth year rejected
the orthodox Church as too sullied with worldly ways, and embraced
Montanism as a more outright application of the teachings of Christ. He
condemned all Christians who became soldiers, artists, or state
officials; all parents who did not veil their daughters; all bishops who
restored repentant sinners to communion; finally he called the pope
pastor moec- horum — “shepherd of adulterers.” 89</p>
<p>Despite him the Church prospered in Africa. Able and devoted bishops
like Cyprian made the diocese of Carthage almost as rich and influential
as Rome’s. In Egypt the growth of the Church was slower, and its early
stages are lost to history; suddenly, late in the second century, we
hear of a “Catechetical School” in Alexandria, which wedded Christianity
to Greek philosophy, and produced two major fathers of the Church. Both
Clement and Origen were well versed in pagan literature, and loved it
after their own fashion; if their spirit had prevailed there would have
been a less destructive break between classical culture and
Christianity.</p>
<p>When Origenes Adamantius was seventeen (202) his father was arrested
as a Christian, and condemned to death. The boy wished to join him in
prison and martyrdom; his mother, failing to deter him by other means,
hid all his clothes. Origen sent his fa ther letters of encouragement:
“Take heed,” he bade him, “not to change your mind on our account .” 00
The father was beheaded, and the youth was left to care for the mother
and six young children. Inspired to greater piety by the many martyrdoms
he saw, he adopted the ascetic life. He fasted much, slept little and on
bare ground, wore no shoes, and subjected himself to cold and nakedness;
finally, in rigorous interpretation of Matthew xix, 1 2, he emasculated
himself.* In</p>
<p>• “As it was Origen’s general practice to allegorize Scripture,” says
Gibbon, “it seems un - fortunate that, in this instance only, he should
have adopted the literal sense.” 61</p>
<p>614 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVin</p>
<p>203 he succeeded Clement as head of the Catechetical School. Though
he was only eighteen, his learning and eloquence drew many students,
pagan as well as Christian, and his fame spread throughout the Christian
world. Some ancients reckoned his “books” at 6000; many, of course, were
brief brochures; even so Jerome asked, “Which of us can read all that he
has written?” 02 In love with the Bible, which through boyhood
memorizing had become part of his mind, Origen spent twenty years, and
employed a corps of stenographers and copyists, collating in parallel
columns the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, a Greek transliteration of
that text, and Greek translations of it by the Septuagint, Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion.* By comparing these diverse renderings, and
using his knowledge of Hebrew, Origen offered to the Church a corrected
Septuagint. Insatiate, he added commentaries, sometimes of great length,
on every book in the Bible. In Peri archon, “First Principles,” he
achieved the first orderly and philosophi - cal exposition of Christian
doctrine. In a “Miscellany” ( Stromateis ) he undertook to demonstrate
all Christian dogmas from the writings of the pagan philosophers. To
lighten his task he availed himself of that allegorical method by which
pagan philosophers had made Homer accord with reason, and Philo had
reconciled Judaism with Greek philosophy. The literal mean- ing of
Scripture, argued Origen, overlay two deeper layers of meaning — the
moral and the spiritual — to which only the esoteric and educated few
could penetrate. He questioned the truth of Genesis as literally
understood: he explained away as symbols the unpleasant aspects of
Yahveh’s dealings with Israel; and he dismissed as legends such stories
as that of Satan taking Jesus up to a high mountain and offering him the
kingdoms of the world. 03 Sometimes, he suggested, scriptural narratives
were invented in order to convey some spiritual truth. 04 “What man of
sense,” he asked,</p>
<p>will suppose that the first and the second and the third day, and the
evening and the morning, existed without a sun or moon or stars?</p>
<p>Who is so foolish as to believe that God, like a husbandman, planted
a garden in Eden, and placed in it a tree of life … so that one who</p>
<p>tasted of the fruit obtained life? 05</p>
<p>As Origen proceeds it becomes apparent that he is a Stoic, a
Neo-Pytha- gorean, a Platonist, and a Gnostic, who is nonetheless
resolved to be a Chris- tian. It would have been too much to ask of a
man that he should abandon the faith for which he had edited a thousand
volumes and flung away his manhood. Like Plotinus he had studied under
Ammonius Saccas, and some- times it is hard to distinguish his
philosophy from theirs. God, in Origen, is</p>

Reason who organizes the world; as such he was created by God the
Father, and is subordinate to him. 60 In Origen, as in Plotinus, the
soul passes through a succession of stages and embodiments before
entering the body; and after death it will pass through a like
succession before arriving at God. Even the purest souls will suffer for
a while in Purgatory; but in the end all souls will be saved. After the
“final conflagration” there will be another world with its long history,
and then another, and another. . . . Each will improve on the preceding,
and the whole vast sequence will slowly work out the design of God.

<p>We cannot wonder that Demetrius, Bishop of Alexandria, looked with
some doubt upon the brilliant philosopher who adorned his diocese and
corresponded with emperors. He refused to ordain Origen to the priest-
hood, on the ground that emasculation disqualified him. But while Origen
was traveling in the Near Blast two Palestinian bishops ordained him.
De- metrius protested that this infringed his rights; he convened a
synod of his cl ergy; it annulled Origen’s ordination, and banished him
from Alexandria. Origen removed to Caesarea, and continued his work as a
teacher. There he wrote his famous defense of Christianity Contra Celsum
(248). With magnanimous spirit he admitted the forc e of Celsus’
arguments; but he replied that for every difficulty and improbability in
Christian doctrine there were worse incredibilities in paganism. He
concluded not that both were absurd, but that the Christian faith
offered a nobler way of life than could possibly come from a dying and
idolatrous creed.</p>
<p>In 250 the Decian persecution reached Caesarea. Origen, now
sixty-five, was arrested, stretched on the rack, loaded with chains and
an iron collar, and kept in prison for many days. But death caught up
with Decius first, and Origen was released. He lived only three years
more; torture had fatally injured a body already weakened by unremitting
asceticism. He died as poor as when he had begun to teach, and the most
famous Christian of his time. As his heresies ceased to be the secret of
a few scholars, the Church found it necessary to disown him; Pope
Anastasius condemned his “blas - phemous opinions” in 400, and in 553
the Council of Constantinople pro - nounced him anathema. Nevertheless,
nearly every later Christian savant for centuries learned from him, and
depended upon his work; and his defense of Christianity impressed pagan
thinkers as no “apology” had done before him. With him Christianity
ceased to be only a comforting faith; it became a full-fledged
philosophy, buttressed with Scripture but proudly resting on reason.</p>

<p>V. THE ORGANIZATION OF AUTHORITY</p>
<p>The Church might be excused for condemning Origen: his principle of
allegorical interpretation not only made it possible to prove anything,
but at one blow it did away with the narratives of Scripture and the
earthly life of Christ; and it restored individual judgment precisely
while proposing to defend the faith. Faced with the hostility of a
powerful government, the Church felt the need of unity; it could not
safely allow itself to be divided into a hundred feeble parts by every
wind of intellect, by disloyal heretics, ecstatic prophets, or brilliant
sons. Celsus himself had sarcastically observed that Christians were
“split up into ever so many factions, each individual desiring to have
his own party.” 08 About 1 87 Irenaeus listed twenty varieties</p>
<p>The literature of Christianity in the second century abounded in
gospels, epistles, apocalypses, and “acts.” C hristians differed widely
in accepting or rejecting these as authoritative expressions of the
Christian creed. The Western churches accepted the Book of Revelation,
the Eastern churches generally re- jected it; these accepted the Gospel
according to the Hebrews and the Epistles of James, the Western churches
discarded them. Clement of Alexandria quotes as sacred scripture a late
first-century treatise, The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles. Marcion’s
publication of a New Testament forced the hand of the Church. We do not
know when the books of our present New Testament were determined as
canonical — i.e., as authentic and inspired; we can only say that a
Latin fragment discovered by Muratori in 1740, named after him, and
generally assigned to ca. 1 80, assumes that the canon had by that time
been fixed.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical councils or synods met with increasing frequency in
the sec- ond century. In the third they were limited to bishops; and by
the close of that century they were recognized as the final arbiters of
“Catholic”— i.e., universal — Christian belief. Orthodox} 7 survived
heresy because it satisfied the need for a definite creed that could
moderate dispute and quiet doubt, and because it was supported by the
power of the Church.</p>
<p>The problem of organization lay in determining the center of that
power. After the weakening of the mother church at Jerusalem, the
individual con- gregations, unless established or protected by other
communities, appear to have</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 617</p>
<p>exercised an independent authority. The church of Rome, however,
claimed to have been founded by Peter, and quoted Jesus as saying: “Thou
art Peter”</p>
<p>The earliest occupants of “Peter’s throne” left no mark upon history.
The third, Pope * Clement, stands out as the author of an extant letter
written about 9 6 to the church of Corinth, appealing to its members to
maintain harmony and order; 72 here, o nly a generation after Peter’s
death, the bishop of Rome speaks with authority to the Christians of a
distant congregation. The other bishops, while acknowledging the
“primacy”of the Roman bishop as the lineal successor of Peter,
repeatedly challenged his power to overrule their own decisions. The
Eastern churches celebrated Easter on the fourteenth day of the Jewish
month of Nisan, whatever day of the week this might be; the Western
churches post- poned the feast to the following Sunday. Polycarp, Bishop
of Smyrna, visiting Rome about 156, tried and failed to persuade
Anicetus, Bishop of Rome, to have the Eastern date observed in the West;
and on his return he rejected the Pope’s suggestion that the Eastern
churches should accept the Western datie. Pope Victor (190) rephrased
Anicetus’ request as a command; the bishops of Palestine obeyed, those
of Asia Minor refused. Victor sent out letters to the Christian
congregations, excommunicating the recalcitrant churches; many bishops,
even in the West, protested against so severe a measure, and apparently
Victor did not insist.</p>
<p>His successor Zephyrinus (202- 18) was “a simple and unlettered man.”
7 * To aid him in administering the spreading episcopate of Rome,
Zephyrinus raised to the archdeaconate a man whose intelligence was less
questioned than his morals. Callistus, said his enemies, had begun his
career as a slave, had become a banker, had embezzled the funds
deposited with him, had been sentenced to hard labor, had been released,
had started a riot in a synagogue, had been con- demned to the mines of
Sardinia, had escaped by having his name surreptitiously inserted into a
list of pardoned prisoners, and had then lived for ten years at Antium
in painful peace. When Zephyrinus placed him in charge of the papal
cemetery he transferred it to the Via Appia, in the catacomb that bears
his name. When Zephyrinus died, and Callistus was chosen pope,
Hippolytus and some</p>
<p>• The term papa , “father,” which became in English pope, was applied
in t he first three centuries to any Christian bishop.</p>
<p>&lt;Sl8 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVm</p>
<p>other priests denounced him as unfit, and set up a rival church and
papacy (218). Doctrinal differences accentuated the schism: Callistus
believed in read- mitting to the Church those who, after baptism, had
committed a mortal sin (adultery, murder, apostasy), and who professed
their penitence. Hippolytus considered such lenience ruinous, and wrote
a Refutation of All Heresies, with special attention to this one.
Callistus excommunicated him, gave the Church a competent
administration, and vigorously asserted the supreme authority of the
Roman see over all Christendom.</p>
<p>The schism of Hippolytus ended in 235; but under Pope Cornelius
(251-53) his heresy was revived by two priests — Novatus at Carthage and
Novatian at Rome — who set up schismatic churches dedicated to the
unrelenting exclusion of postbaptismal sinners. The Council of Carthage
under Cyprian, and the Coun- cil of Rome under Cornelius, excommunic
ated both groups. Cyprian’s appeal for Cornelius’ support strengthened
the papacy; but when Pope Stephen I (254-57) ruled that converts from
heretical sects need not be rebaptized, Cyprian led a synod of African
bishops in rejecting the decree. Stephen, like another Cato,
excommunicated them in an ecclesiastical Punic War; his providentially
early death allowed the quarrel to lapse, and averted the secession of
the powerful African Church.</p>
<p>Despite overreachings and setbacks, the Roman see increased its power
with almost every decade. Its wealth and ecumenical charities exalted
its prestige; it was consulted by the Christian world on every issue of
gravity; it took the initiative in repudiating and combating heresies,
and in defining the canon of the Scriptures. It was deficient in
scholars, and could not boast a Tertullian, an Origen, or a Cyprian; it
gave its attention to organization rather than to theory; it built and
governed and let others write and talk. Cyprian rebelled; but it was he
who, in his De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate, acclaimed the see or seat
of Peter ( cathedra Petri) as the center and summit of Christendom, and
proclaimed to the world those principles of solidarity, unanimity, and
persistency which have been the essence and mainstay of the Catholic
Church . 74 By the middle of the third century the position and
resources of the papacy were so‘ strong that Decius vowed he would

<p>As Judea had given Christianity ethics, and Greece had given it
theology, so now Rome gave it organization; all these, with a dozen
absorbed and rival faiths, entered into the Christian synthesis. It was
not merely that the Church took over some religious customs and forms
common in pre-Chris- tian Rome — the stole and other vestments of pagan
priests, the use of incense and holy water in purifications, the burning
of candles and an everlast- ing light before the altar, the worship of
the saints, the architecture</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 6 19</p>
<p>of the basilica, the law of Rome as a basis for canon law, the title
of Pantifex Maximus for the Supreme Pontiff, and, in the fourth century,
the Latin language as the noble and enduring vehicle of Catholic ritual.
The Roman gift was above all a vast framework of government, which, as
secular au- thority failed, became the structure of ecclesiastical rule.
Soon the bishops, rather than the Roman prefects, would be the source of
order and the seat of power in the cities; the metropolitans, or
archbishops, would support, if not supplant, the provincial governors;
and the synod of bishops would succeed the provincial assembly. The
Roman Church followed in the foot- steps of the Roman state; it
conquered the provinces, beautified the capital, and established
discipline and unity from frontier to frontier. Rome died in giving
birth to the Church; the Church matured by inheriting and accepting the
responsibilities of Rome.</p>
