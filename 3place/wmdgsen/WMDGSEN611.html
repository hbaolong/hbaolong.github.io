<h4 id="chapter-xvi-english-life">CHAPTER XVI English Life</h4>
<p>I. CLASSES</p>
<p>A CIVILIZATION is a people given social order by government, law,</p>
<p>religion, morals, customs, and education, and left sufficiently free
to invent and experiment, to develop friendship, charity, and love, and
to beget art, literature, science, and philosophy. How did these forms
of order and liberty operate in the England of 1789 to 1815, and what
did they produce?</p>
<p>First, the natural diversity of men — in heritage, opportunity, and
skills — arranged them into classes each of which contributed a
supporting share to the corporate life. There were no castes in England,
for an individual of out- standing wealth or excellence might rise from
one class to another, even to the peerage; and the relationship of peer
to peasant was often one of friendly intercourse, rarely that of Brahmin
to Untouchable. Serfdom had disap- peared, though only a small minority
of peasants owned the land they tilled. The noble paid taxes like the
rest, and sometimes (unlike their French com- peers) engaged in commerce
or industry. Only the eldest living son of a nobleman shared in his
nobility; the other children were legally (not so- cially)
commoners.</p>
<p>Many unnatural inequalities remained. The concentration of wealth was
unusually high. Equality before the law was nullified by the cost of
litigation. Accused lords could be tried only by the House of Lords (a
jury of their peers); this “privilege of peerage” survived till 1841.
Careless men of no pedigree might be forcibly impressed into the Navy.
Commoners rarely reached high office in the Navy or the Army, in the
civil service, the univer- sities, or the law. A ruling class of nobles
and gentry seldom allowed to the undistinguished mass any share in
determining the personnel or policies of the government.</p>
<p>Perhaps class consciousness was keenest in the bourgeoisie, which re-
mained proudly aloof from the peasantry and the proletariat, and dreamed
of peerages. Within itself there were jealous strata: the industrial
capitalist looked down upon the neighborhood shopkeeper;* the great
merchant who had graced money with adventure stood aloof from the
industrialist; and the swelling nabobs, who had gilded their colonial
gleanings with patriotism and religion, were forming a class of their
own. As in France, so in England, no one seemed content anymore with the
place to which Providence, ca- pacity, or chance had assigned him;
everyone was busy climbing or falling; the restlessness of modernity
began. The basic struggle was of the capitalist # Samuel Adams in 1748
had called England “a creation of shopkeepers”; 1 Napoleon re - peated
it; it was hardly true.</p>
<p>3 5 2</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ENGLISH LIFE</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>o replace the aristocrat at the helm of state; in France it took a
generation; in England it took centuries.</p>
<p>So, till 1832, the nobility was supreme, and smiled at its
challengers. In its strictest sense it consisted, in 1801, of 287
“temporal” peers or peeresses, and twenty- six Anglican bishops, who, as
“spiritual lords,” were entitled to sit in the House of Lords. The
temporal peers were ranked, in descending order, as princes of the
(royal) blood, dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and barons. To all
of these except princes and dukes the appellation “lord” could be
properly applied; and their titles carried down, generation after
generation, to the eldest son. Their wealth was based upon the ownership
of vast areas, tilled by tenant farmers and hired laborers, and bringing
such rents as the Duke of Newcastle’s £ 120,000, or Viscount
Palmerston’s more usual £ 12,000, a year. 2 The combined estates of the
Dukes of Bedford, Nor- folk, and Devonshire could have covered an
average county. 3 Below these lords temporal and spiritual England
ranked 540 baronets and their wives, entided to prefix “Sir” or “Lady”
to their Christian names, and to transmit these titles in their
families. Next were 350 knights and their wives, entitled to the same
prefixes, but not to transmit them. Below these came some six thousand
squires or “gentry”— landowners born in old and accepted families, and
authorized to bear a coat of arms. All these groups below the “lords”
constituted the lesser nobili ty, but they were generally included in
the “aris - tocracy” that ruled England.</p>
<p>It does not seem to have felt that there was anything wrong in
minority rule. Its members bore with stoic equanimity the poverty of the
peasants, the degradation of the factory workers, and the spoliation of
Ireland. Pov- erty, they believed, was the natural and necessary penalty
of incompetence or sloth, and weak-kneed theorists must not be allowed
to transform Britain into a democracy resting on a degenerative dole.
Despite anarchist dreamers like William Godwin or Percy Shelley, some
government is necessary; with- out it the people become a mob, dangerous
to every individual and every liberty. Napoleon was not prejudiced in
favor of England, yet he said at St. Hele na, “It would be a European
disaster if the English aristocracy were to disappear, if it were handed
over to a London mob.” 4 All government is by a minority or by a despot,
and the ruling minority is either an aristocracy of birth or a
plutocracy of wealth. Democracy, of course, is the latter, for only
wealth can finance campaigns, or pay the cost of persuading the people
to vote for the moneyed minority’s candidate. Men democratically chosen
are rarely equipped, by birth and training, to deal successfully with
the problems of government, much less with international relations. An
aristoc- racy of birth is a school of statesmanship. Some of its
graduates may become worthless wastrels, but a saving few acquire, by
long association with the problems and personnel of rule, the ability to
deal with critical affairs with- out endangering the nation by their
bungling. Moreover, a properly func- tioning aristocracy wins from the
people a habit of obedience, and a respect for authority, which are
boons to public order and security.</p>
<p>Such arguments, subtly phrased and obscurely felt, seem to have
per-</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>suaded the majority of the English nation. But they did not convince
the rising bourgeoisie, which resented the power of landed wealth to
control ministries and Parliament; they were angrily repudiated by
rebellious labor; and they were sharply questioned by an intelligentsia
shocked to observe, and resolved to reveal, the means by which a
self-serving aristocracy was governing England.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE GOVERNMENT</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Legislature</li>
</ol>
<p>The Constitution of England is the whole body of unrepealed
enactments of Parliament and unrevoked decisions of the courts. By such
precedents the full authority of the government resided in the Crown
(king or queen) and the Parliament acting in concert; usually, since
1688, the monarch accepted what Parliament legislated. No written
document limited the power of Par- liament to pass any law that pleased
both its chambers. The upper chamber, the House of Lords, consisted of
the temporal and spiritual lords, sitting by right of birth and
tradition, requiring no election, empowered to reject any measure voted
by the House of Commons, and serving as a supreme court in appeals from
judicial decisions, in impeachments of governmental per- sonnel, and in
all actions brought against its secular members on charge of a major
crime. It was a bastion of the aristocracy fighting rearguard actions
against the advancing bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>The House of Commons numbered 558 members: two each from the
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, one from Trinity College, Dublin,
forty- five from Scotland; the rest chosen by forty counties (“shires”)
and twenty boroughs (townships) by electors holding limited franchises
too varied to be specified here. 5 Excluded from the electorate were
women, pau- pers, Roman Catholics, Quakers, Jews, agnostics, and, in
general, anyone who could not swear allegiance to the authority and
doctrines of the Church of England. All in all, there were 245,000
eligible voters in England’s nine million souls. Since voting was
public, few voters dared support any candi- date but the principal
landowner’s nominee; many eligible citizens did not bother to vote; and
some elections were decided by arrangement among the leaders, without
any voting at all. The number of Parliamentary representa- tives allowed
to each borough had been fixed by tradition, and took little ac- count
of growth or decline in the borough’s population; some boroughs with a
mere handful of voters returned one or more members, while London, with
six thousand voters, was allowed only four. The new industrial centers
were poorly represented in Parliament, if at all; Manchester,
Birmingham, and Sheffield had no member there, while the old county of
Cornwall had forty-two. We should add, however, that in local affairs
many towns and villages retained considerable self-rule; so the city of
London, through a property-limited suffrage, chose its own government,
and maintained a proud independence of Parliament.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ENGLISH LIFE</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>About half the seats in the Commons were filled by these semipopular
elections; the other half were filled through uncontested nomination by
local or distant proprietors; and these nominations were in many cases
offered by the boroughs to the highest bidder. “Boroughs, in other words
seats in the House of Commons, were bought and sold as openly as any
article of com- merce; and the King himself was at times the great
purchaser of boroughs.” 6</p>
<p>The chosen members were loosely divided between two parties — Tories
and Whigs. These had largely forgotten the issues that had once divided
them; their leaders were in both cases members of old aristocratic
families; but the Whigs were more inclined than the Tories to listen to
the upcoming and affluent lords of commerce and industry, while the
Tories defended — the Whigs challenged — the traditional “prerogative”
of royal power. The bone of contention was not principle but power:
which party was to form the ruling ministry, divide the lucrative
offices, and oversee the developing, fee-splitting bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Despite its aristocratic base, the British government was
considerably more democratic in its lawmaking than most Continental
states; whereas in these (including France after 1804) the supreme power
was wielded by an em- peror or a king, in Britain the actual ruler,
since 1688, was not the king but the Parliament; and in the bicameral
Parliament the authority lay chiefly with the Commons through its “power
of the purse”: no disbursement of public funds could be made without its
consent. Theoretically the king could veto any measure passed by
Parliament; actually George III never stretched his prerogative to this
testing point. The king, however, could dis- solve the Parliament and
“go to the country” for a new election; in that case the candidates he
favored and financed had a good chance of winning seats, for the
indigenous King (after two alien Georges) had become again the nation
embodied, the central object of patriotic loyalty and pride.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Judiciary</li>
</ol>
<p>The English judiciary was as haphazard, chaotic, and competent as the
legislature. First of all, it had to administer a body of laws that had
grown almost daily through hundreds of years, that had long remained
unsys- tematized, and that was so brutal in its traditional penology
that judges had often to amend it or ignore it. The law was heavy with
relics of its feudal origins and its Christian emendations: accused
lords still demanded to be tried by lords, and “benefit of clergy” still
(till 1827) exempted Anglican ministers from secular courts. Hundreds of
laws (against public gambling, nocturnal amusements, unlicensed
assemblies…) remained in the statutes, though rarely enforced. Some
improvements were made in this period: the number of crimes (some two
hundred) for which, in 1800, death was pre- scribed was repeatedly
reduced; and a true account of assets and liabilities could avert
imprisonment for debt. But the law of bankruptcy remained so cumbersome
that businessmen avoided it as the road to double bankruptcy. The Habeas
Corpus Act of 1679, which aimed to end undue imprisonment</p>
<p>356 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>before trial, had been so often suspended that it lost its force in
crises like the French Revolutionary Wars. The confusion,
contradictions, and bar- barities of British law continued until Bentham
slashed at them with his per- sistent and detailed demands for
reform.</p>
<p>The capture of criminals was made additionally difficult by the
scarcity of police in the towns, and their almost total absence in the
countryside; citi- zens were driven to form voluntary associations to
protect their lives and property. Even if arrested, the criminal might
delay or escape imprisonment by hiring lawyers to find or forge reasons
for appeal, or loopholes in the law; “it was the boast of the lawyers
that there was not a single statute through which they could not drive a
coach and six.” 7</p>
<p>At the lowest rung of the legal profession were the attorneys or
solicitors, who acted as legal agents for a client, or researched and
prepared briefs for the barristers, who were the only lawyers admitted
to the bar. From them the king, usually on recommendations by the lord
chancellor, chose the judges.</p>
<p>Once or twice a year the judges of the Common Law Courts toured the
counties to try, locally, civil and criminal cases. As their stay in any
one place was brief, the administration — in some measure the creation —
of the law in each county or borough was left to local “justices of the
peace.” These were chosen by the central government from among the
richer landowners of the district; they were unpaid, but their wealth
was expected to keep them from corruption. They were not above class
prejudice, and some be- came famous for severe sentences against
radicals; but, all in all, they pro- vided fair and competent local
administration, almost equal to that of the prefects in Napoleonic
France.</p>
<p>The best feature of English law was the right of the accused to trial
by jury. Apparently this institution of the Carolingian Franks had come
to England in primitive form with the Norman Conquest. The size of the
jury was not fixed at twelve members until 1367; and only about that
time was a unanimous verdict required. The jurors were chosen — usually
from the mid- dle class — from a panel of forty-eight to seventy-two
men, after extensive rights of challenge by the contending parties.
Periodically the justices of the peace were assisted in each county by a
grand jury, upon whose recom- mendations the court was expected to act.
In trials the jurors heard the evi- dence, the speeches of contending
counsel, and the judge’s summing up; after this they retired to an
adjoining room, where, “in order to avoid in - temperance and causeless
delay,” they were kept without meat, drink, fire, or candle (unless by
permission of the judge) “till they were unanimously agreed.” 8</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Executive</li>
</ol>
<p>Theoretically the executive power was vested in the monarch; actually
it lay in his cabinet of ministers; and these had to be members of
Parliament, responsible to it for their actions, and dependent upon it
for their funds.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ENGLISH LIFE</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>Theoretically the king appointed these ministers; in practice he was
expected to choose as their head the leader of the party victorious in
the latest elec- tion; and this prime minister, with others prominent in
his party, nominated, f or the ruler’s formal appointment, the
secretaries of the various ministries. In his first administration
(1783-1801) William Pitt took a double role as chancellor of the
exchequer and first lord of the treasury; that is, he con- trolled,
subject to Parliamentary approval, both the collection and the dis-
bursement of the national revenue. In the Cabinet, as well as in the
govern- ment as a whole, the power of the purse was the chief instrument
of disci- pline and rule.</p>
<p>George III did not admit his subordination to Parliament. From his
acces- sion in 1760, at the age of twenty-two, he had sought to enforce
the royal prerogatives. But the costly collapse of his leadership in the
War of Ameri- can Independence, and his repeated intervals of insanity
(1765, 1788, 1804, 1810-20), weakened his body, mind, and will, and
after 1788 he allowed William Pitt to govern except for three provisos:
slavery must not be finally condemned, the British Catholics must not be
allowed to vote, and there should be no peace with France until Louis
XVIII was securely placed on his rightful throne.</p>
<p>George III was a good man within the limits of his vision and his
creed. Napoleon, in captive retrospect, described him as “the honestest
man in hi s dominions.” 9 He distinguished himself from his Hanoverian
predecessors by obeying all the Commandments except the fifth, and by
falling far short of the Levitican injunction to “love thy neighbor as
thyself”; but he loved the English people. Despite his faults, and
because of his misfortunes, they loved him in return — for loving his
inherited religion, for loving his wife and daughters, and for giving
the nation an inspiring picture of a simple and de- voted life. Their
hearts went out to him when, despite his example, most of his sons
tarnished their princely titles with marital chaos, conscienceless
gambling, reckless extravagance, and visible deterioration of body and
char- acter. Wellington was to describe them as “the damnedest
millstones, about the neck of any government, that can be imagined.”
10</p>
<p>The oldest of them — George, Prince of Wales — was the most
impossible, troublesome, and charming. He was handsome and knew it. He
had received a good education, could speak French, German, and Italian
fluently, sang well, played the violoncello, wrote poetry, kept in touch
with contemporary English literature, numbered Richard Sheridan and
Thomas Moore among his intimate friends, and was an intelligent patron
of art. He set up at Carl- ton House a princely establishment, furnished
it elegantly at the nation’s cost, favored the politics and rivaled the
thirst of Charles James Fox, and, to the horror of his father, became
the idol of the Whigs. He liked, too, the young dandies who spent their
wealth on fancy clothing, women, horses, and dogs ; 11 he accompanied
such Britons to prizefights, and outpaced every- one in expenditure and
debts. Parliament repeatedly voted a hundred thou- sand pounds to
restore his solvency , 12 for none could tell when this good- natured
wastrel would, as king, be the generous donor of lucrative
sinecures.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>At seventeen he had confessed to being “rather too fond of women and
wine.” Among his early mistresses was Mary Robinson, who fascinated him
by her playing of Perdita in A Winter’s Tale; for three years he
maintained her in precarious luxury. Then he entered upon a more serious
affair with Maria Anne Fitzherbert, twice widowed, Roman Catholic, six
years his senior, and unmanageably decent; she refused to become his
mistress, but consented to marry him. The Act of Settlement that had
given the throne of England to the house of Hanover had excluded from
the succession any husband or wife of a Roman Catholic; and a law of
1772 prohibited any member of the royal family under twenty-five years
of age from marrying without the ruler’s consent. Neverthele ss, the
Prince married Mrs. Fitzher- bert (1785), paying a young Anglican curate
five hundred pounds to per- form the illegal ceremony; the illegality
preserved the Prince’s right of suc - cession. He assumed this right in
1788, when his father lapsed into insanity; he waited impatiently for
him to die; but father and son could seldom agree.</p>
<p>They agreed, however, that if the King (actually Parliament) would
pay the Prince’s new debts ( £ 1 10,000), the heir apparent would leave
his morganatic wife an d marry his father’s niece, Princess Caroline of
Bruns - wick. He found her discouragingly ugly, she found him
disgustingly fat; but they married, April 8, 1795. Caroline later
averred that he had spent the wedding night in a drunken torpor; 13
however, she gave him a daughter, Princess Charlotte, January 7, 1796.
Soon thereafter he left her, and re- turned, for a time, to
Mrs. Fitzherbert, who was apparently the only woman whom he ever deeply
loved. (When he died, a miniature with a portrait of her was found
pendant from his neck. 14 )</p>
<p>In November, 1810, George III — breaking under Parliamentary opposi-
tion, shame for his son, and grief for his dead daughter Amelia — went
finally insane. For nine years thereafter the King of England was a
raving, strait- jacketed lunatic, pitied and beloved by his people; and
the Regent, assum- ing all royal pomp and power, was a degenerate ruin,
fat, fifty, kindly, cuckolded, and despised.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>RELIGION</li>
</ol>
<p>The government and the intelligentsia of England had by this time</p>
<p>reached a gentlemen’s agreement about religion. The deistic attack
upon the orthodox creed had subsided as the skeptics came to realize
that they had nothing to put in its place as an aid to individual
morality and public peace. William Godwin, Robert Owen, Jeremy Bentham,
and James Mill were sur- viving examples of unbelief, but they made no
propaganda thereof; Tom Paine was an exception. The English aristocracy,
which had found some charm in the young Voltaire, was now carefully
conspicuous in Sabbath observance. “It was a wonder to the lower orders
throughout all parts of England,” noted the Annual Register in 1798, “to
see the avenues to the</p>

<p>churches filled with carriages” on Sundays. 15 John Stuart Mill
remarked in 1838:</p>
<p>There is, in the English mind, both in speculation and in practice, a
highly salutary shrinking from all extremes…. Quieta non movere [not to
disturb the quiet] was the favourite doctrine of those times;…
therefore, on condi- tion of not making too much noise about religion,
or taking it too much in earnest, the Church was supported even by
philosophers as a bulwark against fanaticism, a sedative to the
religious spirit, to prevent this from disturbing the harmony of society
or the tranquillity of the state. The clergy of the Estab- lishment
thought they had a good bargain on these terms, and kept its condi-
tions very faithfully. 16</p>
<p>The Established Church was officially the “United Church of England
and Ireland.” Though it accepted the Thirty -nine Articles of the
Calvinist creed, it kept many features of the Catholic ritual. It had
archbishops and bishops, but these usually married, and they were
appointed by the Crown. Local parsons were generally chosen by the local
squires, and helped them in maintaining social order. The Anglican
clergy acknowledged the king as their head and ruler, and depended upon
the state to collect from all families in England the tithe that
supported the Church. Burke described Britain as a Christian
Commonwealth in which Church and state were “one and the same thing,
being diff erent integral parts of the same whole”; and John Wil - son
Croker called Westminster Abbey “a part of the British Constitution.” 17
The relationship resembled that between the Catholic Church and the gov-
ernment of France under Louis XIV, except that there was almost no per-
secution for heresy.*</p>
<p>The dissenting sects — Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists,
Independents, Congregationalists, Quakers, and Unitarians — were allowed
to preach their doctrines on one condition: that they declare themselves
Christians. 19 Some Dissenters sat in the House of Lords. Methodist
preachers gathered great audiences by their frightening eloquence. The
oppressed workers of the towns, losing earthly hopes, returned to their
childhood faith, and with such ardor that when revolutionary ideas swept
over the Channel from France, they resisted all efforts to make them
revolt. In 1792 the leaders of Wesleyan Methodism required of each
adherent an oath of loyalty and obedience to the king. 20</p>
<p>Within the Established Church itself the influence of Methodism
inspired an “Evangelical Movement”: many of the younger clergy and laity
resolved to revitalize the Anglican creed by taking the Gospel to heart,
and devoting themselves to simple living, piety, charity, and church
reform. One of them, William Wilberforce, led the English campaign
against slavery; another, Hannah More, spread a fresh Christian fervor
by her lectures, books, and Sunday schools.</p>

<li>In the letter of the law an atheist was an outlaw, and might be
hunted down like a criminal. Blasphemy — any indignity offered to God by
word, writing, or sign — could be pun- ished by eighteen two-hour
periods of standing in the pillory. 18 These laws were rarely
enforced.</li>

<p>360</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Two religious groups remained outside the circle of full toleration:
Catho- lics and Jews. English Protestants had not forgotten Guy Fawkes
and his attempt to blow up the Parliament ( 1 605 ) , nor the
flirtations of Stuart kings — Charleses I and II, James II — with
Catholic powers, mistresses, and ideas; they tended to look upon a
Catholic as one who had given his allegiance to a foreign potentate (the
popes were temporal sovereigns as rulers of the Papal States), and they
wondered how a Catholic would behave in a conflict be- tween a Roman
pontiff and a British king.</p>
<p>There were some sixty thousand Catholics in the England of 1800. Most
of them were of Irish origin, but some were indigenous descendants of
pre- Reformation British Catholics. The laws against them had by this
time been much relaxed. Various enactments between 1774 and 1793 had
restored to them the right to own land, to hold their own services, and
to transmit their faith through their own schools; and a specially
worded oath enabled them to swear allegiance to the king and the
government without repudiating the pope. However, they could not vote,
ana could not be elected to Parliament.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century the movement for the full
emancipation of English Catholics seemed on the verge of success. Promi-
nent Protestants — Wesley, Canning, Wilberforce, Lord Grey — supported
it. The French Revolution aroused in England a reaction against Voltaire
and the Enlightenment, and some sympathy for a religion so opposed by
the revolutionary government. After 1792 the French emigres, including
Cath- olic priests and monks, received a warm welcome, and financial
aid, from the British state; the exiles were allowed to establish
monasteries and seminaries. The notion that a Church so weakened and
despoiled could be a danger to England now seemed absurd, and in a war
against France that Church could be a valuable ally. In 1800 Pitt
introduced a bill for the emancipation of Catholics in England. The
Tories and the High Church Anglicans opposed it, and George III stood
resolutely with them. Pitt withdrew his motion, and resigned. Catholic
emancipation in England had to wait till 1829.</p>
<p>Still tardier (1858) was the removal of civil disabilities from the
Jews in England. They numbered some 26,000 in 1800: most of them in
London, some in the provincial cities, almost none in the countryside.
The long war interrupted further immigration, and allowed the English
Jews to adjust themselves to British ways, and to break down some racial
barriers. The law still barred them from the franchise, and from major
offices, by requiring an oath “on the faith of a Christian,” and taking
of the sacrament according to the rites of the Established Church.
Otherwise they were free, and might worship unhindered in their homes
and synagogues. Several prominent Jews accepted conversion to
Christianity — Sampson Gideon the banker, David Ricardo the economist,
Isaac Disraeli the author. The last, besides fathering the incomparable
Benjamin, published anonymously and casually, between 1791 and 1834,
Curiosities of Literature, which can still please an educated and
leisured mind.</p>
<p>The long experience of the Jews in banking, and their family
connections across frontiers, enabled them to come to the aid of the

<p>in the Seven Years’ War and the long duel with France. The brothers
Ben - jamin and Abraham Goldsmid helped Pitt to break the ring of
extortionate brokers who had monopolized the transactions in Treasury
issues. In 1810 Nathan Rothschild (1777-1836) established in London a
branch of the firm that his father, Meyer Amschel Rothschild, had
founded in Frankfurt-am- Main. Nathan seems to have been the ablest of
the financial geniuses who distinguished the family through several
centuries and in many states. He became the favorite intermediary of the
British government in its financial relations with foreign powers; it
was he or his agents who transmitted from England to Austria and Prussia
the subsidies that enabled them to fight Na- poleon; and he played a
leading role in the industrial and commercial ex- pansion of England
after 1 8 1 5. 21</p>

<li>EDUCATION</li>
</ol>
<p>England seemed resolved to show how a government could get along
without send- ing its children to school. The aristocracy was not
interested in education except for its own sons. It seemed better for
the status quo that the peasant and the proletaire, and probably the
bourgeois too, should be unable to read, especially now that Godwin,
Owen, Cobbett, Paine, Coleridge, and Shelley were printing such nonsense
about ex- ploitive aristocracies, agricultural communes, factory slaves,
and the necessity of atheism. “The resolute advocates of the old
system,” wrote Godwin about 1793, “h ave, with no contemptible
foresight, opposed the communication of knowledge as a most alarming
innovation. In their well-known observation — that ‘a servant who has
been taught to write and read ceases to be any longer the passive
machine they require’— is contained the embryo from which it would be
easy to explain the whole philosophy of European society.” 22 Besides
(argued the upper echelon), the lower classes would be unable to judge
with wisdom and caution the notions presented to them in lectures,
journals, or books; ideas would be explosives; given nationwide
schooling, the “mon - strous regiment” of dreamy simpletons would try to
tear down the necessary privi - leges and powers of the only classes
that can preserve social order and civilization. And manufacturers,
worried by competitors, pressed by investors, and looking for cheap
labor, saw no sense in teaching child laborers the Rights of Man and the
splendors of utopia. “These principles,” said an anonymous conservative
quoted by Godwin, “will inevitably ferment in the minds of the vulgar,…
or the attempt to carry them into execution will be attended with every
species of calamity…. Knowl- edge and taste, the improvements of the
intellect, the discoveries of the sages, the beaut ies of poetry and
art, are trampled under foot and extinguished by barbarians.” 23</p>
<p>In 1806 Patrick Colquhoun, former police magistrate in London,
estimated that two million children in England and Wales received no
education; in 1810 Alexander Murray, philologist, calculated that three
fourths of the agricultural laborers were illit- erate; in 1819 official
statistics reported 674,883 children attending schools in England and
Wales — a fifteenth of the population. 24 When, in 1796, Pitt proposed
that the gov- ernment set up schools for industrial education, his
measure did not come to a vote; when, in 1806, Samuel Whitbread offered
a bill for the governmental establishment of an elementary school in
every parish (such as already existed in Scotland), it was passed by the
Commons, but was rejected by the Lords on the ground that it did not
place education on a religious basis.</p>
<p>Religious groups taxed themselves to provide some education for some
of their chil- dren. The Society for Promotin g Christian Knowledge
maintained “charity schools,”</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>he a’ge of Napoleon</p>
<p>(chap, xvi</p>
<p>but their total enrollment of children did not exceed i,ooo. 25
Hannah More’s schools were almost confined to religious instruction. The
Poor Law administration opened “Industry Schools” to 21,600 of its
194,914 children to fit them for employment. One</p>
<p>In 1797 Dr. Andrew Bell, to meet a shortage of teachers, established
a “monitorial system” of using older students as ass istant instructors
in elementary schools con- nected with the Anglican worship. A year
later Joseph Lancaster introduced a similar system on principles
accepted by all Christians. The churchmen refused to operate with this
undenominational plan; Lancaster was denounced as a deist, an apostate,
a tool of Satan, and Coleridge joined in the condemnation. 26 In 1810
James Mill, Lord Brougham, Francis Place, and Samuel Rogers founded the
Royal Lancastrian Associ- ation to spread unsectarian schools. Alarmed
by the progress of the plan, the Anglican bishops organized a rival
“Society for the Education of the Poor in Accordance with</p>
<p>Higher education was provided, for those who could afford it, by
domes- tic tutors, “public” schools, lecturers, and two universities.
The public schools — Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, Westminster, and
Charter- house — were open, for a fee, to the sons of the nobility and
the gentry, with occasional additions from affluent bourgeois. The
course of studies was pri- marily classical — the languages and
literatures of ancient Greece and Rome. Some sciences were added on the
side, but the parents wanted their sons trained for government and
polite company, and they were convinced that a youth could better
prepare for these by Greek and Roman history, litera- ture, and oratory
than by physics, chemistry, and English poetry; Milton, however, was
admitted as a displaced Roman who wrote Latin almost as readily as
English.</p>
<p>Discipline in the public schools was a mixture of flogging and
fagging. Major offenders were flogged by the masters; fagging was the
provision of menial services by boys of the lower “forms” of classes for
those of the</p>
<p>From such schools the graduate — usually at the age of eighteen —
went on to become an “undergraduate” at Oxford or Cambridge. These
universities had declined from their late-medieval and Renaissance
excellence; Gibbon was not alone in regretting his Oxford days as mostly
wasted in irrelevant</p>

<p>studies (though he profited hugely from the Latin and Greek), and
student competition in gambling, drinking, wenching, and warfare with
the town. Admission required acceptance of the Established Church.
Instruction was by dons, each of whom took charge of one or more pupils,
and transmitted his lore to them by lectures or tutoring. There too the
classics dominated the curriculum, but mathematics, law, philosophy, and
modem history had won a place, and lectures were available — though
sparsely attended — in astronomy, botany, physics, and chemistry.</p>
<p>Oxford was Tory, Cambridge was Whig. In the latter, subscription to
the Thirty-nine Articles had been removed as a condition for entrance,
but only members of the Church of England could take a degree. The
campaign against slavery had been waged there since 1785. Science found
at Cam- bridge better teachers and more students than at Oxford, but
both universi- ties lagged behind the German and the French. Oxford
taught philosophy from the works of Aristotle; Cambridge added Locke,
Hartley, and Hume. Cambridge was producing scholars of international
renown; Oxford aimed rather to fit men for eloquence and strategy in
Parliament, and then, after trials and experience, and with proper
connections, for a role in the govern- ment of Britain.</p>
<p>V. MORALITY</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Man and Woman</li>
</ol>
<p>What kind of moral life evolved from this class government, this
changing economy, this union of state and Church, this education so
limited in content and spread, this national heritage once strengthened
by isolation, now chal- lenged by communication, revolution, and
war?</p>
<p>Men and women are not naturally moral, for their social instincts,
which favor cooperation, are not as strong as their individualistic
impulses, which serve the self; so these must be weakened, and those
strengthened, by law expressing the will and power of the group, and by
a moral code transmitted through the family, the church, the school,
public opinion, custom, and taboos. Inevitably, then, there was
considerable crime in the England of 1789-1815, a deal of dishonesty,
and a flow of premarital sex. If we may be- lieve Hogarth and Boswell,
brothels and streetwalkers abounded in London and the factory towns. The
aristocracy had found prostitutes less expensive than mistresses. Lord
Egremont, open-handed host to Turner and other artists, “was said to
have had a series of mistresses, by whom he sired many children…. The
gossip, however, only added to the warmth his friends felt for him.” 27
We may judge the morals of the upper classes by the amiability with
which they adjusted themselves to those of the Prince of Wales. “The
Prince grew up amidst the most licentious aristocracy that England had
known since the Middl e Ages.” 28 The peasantry may be presumed to have
respected the old moral code, for the family organization of agriculture

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>quired a strong parental authority, and allowed almost inescapable
surveil- lance of the young by the old. The growing proletariat,
however, released from such controls, imitated its exploiters as well as
its income would allow. “Low wages in unregulated sweatshop industries
made temptation strong” 29 for women factory workers to sell themselves
for an added pittance to their minimal wage.</p>
<p>Until 1929 the legal age of marriage was fourteen for the male,
twelve for the female. Normally marriage was mercenary. A man or a woman
was maritably desirable according to his or her actual or prospective
income; mothers schemed night and day (as in Jane Austen’s novels) to
marry their daughters to money. Love marriages were still exceptional,
though literature was exalting them. Common-law marriage was legally
recognized; formal marriage required a clergyman. Families were large,
for children were eco- nomic assets, only a little less so in factories
than on farms. Contraception was primitive. The rate of population
growth was rising, but was slowed by infantile and senile mortality, and
the inadequacy of nourishment, medi- cal care, and public sanitation.
Adultery was widespread. Divorce could be obtained by the husband or
(after 1801) by the wife, but only by an act of Parliament, which cost
so much that only 3 1 7 divorces were granted before the law was
liberalized in 1859. Until 1859 a woman’s movable property became her
husband’s at marriage, and he automatically acquired whatever</p>
<p>We hear of wealthy women, but they were few. By the custom of entail
a father who had no living son could — and in many cases did — bequeath
his estate to a male relative, leaving his daughters dependent on
friendship or courtesy. It was a man’s world.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Mary W oilstone craft</li>
</ol>
<p>Custom had inured most British women to these inequities, but the
winds now blowing from Revolutionary France aroused some sufferers to
protest. Mary Wollstonecraft felt them, and raised her voice in one of
the ablest appeals ever made for women’s liberation.</p>
<p>Her father was a Londoner who decided to try farming; he failed, lost
his fortune and his wife, took to drink, and left his three daughters to
earn their own living. They opened a school, won praise from Samuel
Johnson, and went bankrupt. Mary became a governess, but was dismissed
after a year because “the children loved their governess better than
their mother.” 31 Meanwhile she wrote several books, including, in 1792,
at the age of thirty- three, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.</p>
<p>She dedicated it to “M. Talleyrand - Perigord, Late Bishop of
Autun,”</p>
<p>with a hint that since the Constituent Assembly had proclaimed the
Rights of Man, it was morally obligated to issue a Declaration of the
Rights of Woman. Perhaps to ease her way she took a high moral tone,
professing loy-</p>

<p>ENGLISH LIFE</p>
<p>365</p>
<p>alty to country, virtue, and God. She said little of woman suffrage,
for “as the whole system of representation is now in this country only a
convenient handle for despotism, they [women] need not complain; for
they are as well represented as a numerous class of hardworking
mechanics, who pay for the support of royalty when they can scarcely
stop their children’s mouths with bread.” Nevertheless, “I really think
that women ought to have representa - tives [in Parliament], instead of
being governed without having any direct share allowed them in the
deliberations of government.” 32 As an example of sexually based
legislation she pointed to the laws of primogeniture and entail. And
custom was even cruder than law, for it branded and punished a woman
through life for one moment’s departure from chastity, “though men
preserve their respectability during the indulgence of vice.” 33</p>
<p>Probably some readers were shocked by Mary’s declaration of a woman’s
right to feel, or to confess, physical satisfaction in coitus. 34 But
she warned both sexes that “love considered as an animal appetite cannot
long feed itself without expiring”; 35 indeed, in that sense “it is the
most evanescent of all passions.” 3 6 Love as a physical relationship
should be gradually replaced by friendship. This requires mutual
respect, and respect requires that each mate should find in the other an
individual and developing character. 37 Hence the best beginning of
woman’s libe ration lies in recognizing her faults, and that her freedom
will depend upon her education in mind and</p>
<p>The Vindication proceeded to list some feminine faults of that time:
the affectation of weakness and timidity, which feeds and pleases the
male’s as - sumption of superiority; the addiction to cards, gossip,
astrology, sentimen- tality, and literary trash; the absorption in dress
and self-admiration.</p>
<p>Nature, music, poetry, and gallantry all tend to make women the
creatures of sensation,… and this overstretched sensibility naturally
relaxes the other powers of the mind, and prevents intellect from
attaining that sovereignty which it ought to attain;… for the exercise
of the understanding, as life ad- vances, is the only method pointed out
by Nature to calm the passions. 38</p>
<p>Nearly all these faults, Mary felt, were due to inequalities of
education, and to man’s success in making women think that (as a lady
authoress had told them), “Your best, your sweetest empire is to
please.” 39</p>
<p>Mary resented these fripperies and artifices, and looked with envy
upon those Frenchwomen who insisted on getting an education, and who
learned to write letters that are among the fairest products of the
French mind. “In France there is understandably a more general diffusion
of knowledge than in any other part of the European world, and I
attribute it, in part measure, to the social intercourse that has long
subsisted between the sexes.” 40 A gen - eration before Balzac, Mary
Wollstonecraft noted that</p>
<p>he French, who admit more of mind into their notions of beauty, give
the preference to women of thirty…. They allow women to be in their most
perfect state when vivacity gives place to reason, and to that majestic
serious- ness of character which marks maturity…. In youth, till twenty,
the body shoots out; till thirty the solids are attaining a degree of
density, and the</p>

character to the countenance — that is, they trace the operation of the
mind with the iron pen of fate, and tell us not only what powers are
within, but how they have been em- ployed. 41</p>
<p>The faults of women, Mary believed, were nearly all due to the denial
of educational opportunities, and to the male’s success in getting women
to think of themselves as sex toys before marriage, and as decorative
ornaments, obedient servants, and maternity machines afterward. To give
both sexes an equal chance to develop mind and body, boys and girls — up
to the time of technical vocation — should be educated together, with
the same curriculum and, when possible, the same or equivalent sports.
Every woman should be made sufficiently strong in body and competent in
mind to earn her own liv- ing if necessary, 42 but “whatever tends to
incapacitate the maternal character</p>
<p>Having seen her book through the press, the brilliant young
author</p>
<p>crossed the Channel to France, fascinated by the creative years of
the Revo- lution, but just in time for the Massacres and the Terror. She
fell in love with an American in Paris, Captain Gilbert Imlay, and
agreed to live with him in unsanctioned union. After making her
pregnant, Imlay took to ab- senting himself for months at a time, on
business or otherwise. Her letters begging him to come back 40 are
almost as eloquent, and were as futile, as those of Julie de Lespinasse
a generation before. In 1794 she bore her child, but this did not hold
the father. He offered to send her a yearly fund for her support; she
refused it, and returned to England (1795). She tried to drown herself
in the Thames, but was dragged back to life by solicitous watermen.</p>
<p>A year later she met William Godwin and became his common-law wife;
neither of them believed in the right of the state to regulate marriage.
How- ever, for the sake of their expected child, they decided to submit
to a religious ceremony (March 29, 1797). Ashamed or their legality,
they concealed from their radical friends the fact that they were no
longer living in sin. For a while she shone in the rebel circle that
gathered around the publisher Jo- seph Johnson: Godwin, Thomas Holcroft,
Tom Paine, William Words- worth, and William Blake (who illustrated some
of her writings). On Au- gust 30, 1797, amid intense suffering, she gave
birth to Shelley’s future wife. Ten days later she died.</p>

<li>Social Morality</li>
</ol>
<p>By and large, despite those steady and decent lives that history
fails to re- cord, each class of the English population in this period
shared in a general moral deterioration. Gambling was universal; the
government itself (till</p>

<li>took a hand in it with a national lottery. Drunkenness was endemic,
as an escape from cold mists and rains, brutalizing poverty, family
warfare, political strains, philosophical despair; Pitt and Fox,
otherwise so different, agreed in favoring this anesthesia. Taverns were
allowed to remain open through Saturday night till 1 1 a.m. Sunday, 47
for Saturday was pay day, and time had to be allowed the “pub” to get
its prime cut of the weekly wage. The middle classes drank more
moderately; the upper classes drank heavily, but had learned to carry
their liquor steadily, like a leaking tub.</li>
</ol>
<p>A special indulgence allowed political corruption at every stage of
gov- ernment. In many cases, as already noted, votes, boroughs,
nominations, offices — in some cases peerages — were bought and sold as
openly as shares on the stock exchange. George III, whose virtues were
domestic, saw no wrong in laying out money for the procurement of votes
for or in Parliament, or distributing offices for political support. In
1 809 seventy-six M.P.s held such sinecures. “A favored few connected by
relationship or interest with the rich and the powerful received huge
salaries for doing nothing, whilst the men who actually did the work
were in many cases grossly underpaid.” 48 Judges sold the subordinate
posts in their jurisdiction, and exacted from their holders a share of
the fees which the public paid for official services.</p>
<p>The government could be cruel as well as venal. We have mentioned the
severity of its penal code. The forcible impressment of wayfarers into
the Navy was a prelude to low pay, bad food, and merciless discipline.
49 On several occasions the crews mutinied; one such strike blockaded
the port of London for a month. Nevertheless, the English sailors were
the best seamen and naval warriors in history.</p>
<p>Many efforts were made for moral reform. In 1787 George III issued a
condemnation of Sabbath-breaking, blasphemy (cursing), drunkenness, ob-
scene literature, and immoral amusements; the effect is not recorded.
Jeremy Bentham, with his Parliamentary Reform Catechism (1809), led a
dozen able disciples in exposing political venality and incompetence.
Methodist and Evangelical preaching had some effect, which was doubled
when the Revo- lution raised fears that a nation so morally unhinged
could successfully com- bat French invasion or internal revolt. A
Society for the Suppression of Vice campaigned against dueling,
brothels, and pornography. Other reformers at- tacked child labor, the
use of children as chimneysweeps, the horrors of the prisons, the
ferocity of the penal code. A wave of humanitarianism, stem- ming partly
from religion, partly from the Enlightenment, spread works of
philanthropy and charity.</p>
<p>William Wilberforce was the most tireless of the English reformers.
Born in Hull (1759) of a family rich in both land and commerce, and
going through Cambridge as a comrade of William Pitt, he had little
trouble in get- ting elected to Parliament (1774) a year after Pitt
became prime minister. Feeling the influence of the Evangelical
Movement, he helped to establish the Society for the Reformation of
Manners (1787). Above all he protested that a nation officially
Christian still tolerated the trade in African slaves.</p>
<p>England was now leading in this traffic. In 1790 British vessels
transported</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>38,000 slaves to America, French ships 20,000, Portuguese 10,000,
Dutch 4,000, Danish 2,000; each nation contributed according to its
ability in what was probably the most criminal action in history. From
Liverpool and Bristol the ships carried liquor, firearms, cotton goods,
and diverse trinkets to the “Slave Coast” of Africa. There, often with
the purchased help of native chieftains, the Christian chieftains
exchanged their cargo for Negroes, who were then taken to the West
Indies and the Southern colonies in North America. The captives were
closely packed in the hulls of the vessels, and in many cases were
chained to prevent rebellion or suicide. Food and water were just enough
to keep them alive, ventilation was poor, sanitation mini- mal. To
reduce the load in a severe storm, sick slaves might be thrown over-
board; sometimes the not sick too, for every slave was insured, and
might be worth more dead than alive. It has been calculated that of the
approxi- mately twenty million Negroes transported to the British West
Indies only twenty percent survived the voyage. 50 On the return trip
the ships carried molasses; in Britain this was distilled into rum,
which was used to purchase slaves for the next run.</p>
<p>The Quakers, on both continents, took the lead in attacking the trade
as the first step in the abolition of slavery. A score of writers joined
in the English campaign: John Locke, Alexander Pope, James Thomson,
Richard Savage, William Cowper, and, not least, Mrs. Aphra Behn, whose
novel Oroonoko (1678) had given a revolting description of the West
Indian economy. In 1772 the Quaker Granville Sharp secured from the Earl
of Mansfield, lord chief justice, a decree forbidding the importation of
slaves into Britain; any slave was to become automatically free the
moment he set foot on British soil. In 1786 another Quaker, Thomas
Clarkson, published an Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human
Species, presenting in impressive total the results of almost a lifetime
of research. In 1787 Clarkson, Sharp, Wilberforce, Josiah Wedgwood, and
Zachary Macaulay (father of the historian) formed the Society for the
Abolition of the Slave Trade. In 1789 Wilberforce offered the Commons a
bill to end the evil; it was outvoted by mercantile funds. In 1792 Pitt
made one of his greatest speeches to defend a similar measure; this too
failed. Wilberforce tried again in 1798, 1802, 1804, 1805, and was
repeatedly repulsed. It remained for Charles James Fox, in his brief
ministry (1806-07), to press the matter to victory; Parliament yielded,
and forbade any participation, by British merchants, in the slave trade.
Wilberforce and “the Saints” who supported him knew that this vic - tory
was but a beginning; they pressed on with a campaign for the emanci-
pation of all the slaves still on British soil. Wilberforce died in

<p>One of the most startling events of 1797 was the first appearance of
the silk top hat; apparently it was worn by a London haberdasher who
claimed</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ENGLISH LIFE</p>
<p>369</p>
<p>he Englishman’s inborn right to be unique. Crowds gathered about hi
m; some women, we are told, fainted at the alarming sight. But there is
nothing so absurd that couturiers and haberdashers cannot make it an
imperative fashion; soon all upper-class London males were carrying
stovepipes on their heads.</p>
<p>Swords on the hip and wigs on the head were disappearing. Beards were
shaved. Most males let their hair grow to their shoulders, but some
young- sters expressed their defiant individuality by having their hair
clipped short. 61 Pantaloons were winning the battle for men’s legs; by
1785 trousers reached to midcalf; by 1793 they fell to the ankles.
Shoestrings were displacing buckles and beginning their irksome reign.
Coats were long, and now dis- pensed with embroidery, but art and income
were lavished on waistcoats.</p>
<p>As in contemporary France under the Directory, the crossing of noble
and commoner produced the dandy — the “buck” or “beau.” George Bryan
“Beau” Brummel (1778 -1840) specialized in adorning himself, and spent
half the day in dressing and undressing. At Eton, where the students
called him “Buck,” he became the intimate friend of the Prince of Wales,
who felt that clothing is half the art of rule. Having inherited thirty
thousand pounds, Brummel hired separate tailors for each part of his
body, and made himself arbiter elegantiarum for London’s males. He was
good -humored and kindly, and made cleanliness next to cravats; but he
loved gambling even more than finery, ran up debts, fled across the
Channel to escape his creditors, lived for twenty years in dingy poverty
and slovenly dress, and died, aged sixty-two, in a French asylum for the
insane.</p>
<p>Women were abandoning hoops, but they still corseted themselves to
keep their breasts poised and full. The waistline was raised, and a
generous decollete attended to the rest. During the Regency (1811-20),
fashions drastically changed: corsets were discarded, petticoats were
left unused, and gowns were transparent enough to reveal the lines of
thighs and legs. Byron thought these revelations were dulling the
fascination of pursuit, and, in a rare excursion into morality,
complained: “Like Mother Eve our maids may stray unblamed, / For they
are naked, and are not ashamed.” 62</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was more modesty in dress than in eating. Meals
were immense, not so much through gluttony as because the climate
encouraged adipose tissue as a help to body heat. The poor relied
basically on bread and cheese, ale or tea, but in the money classes the
main meal — sometimes lasting from nine to midnight — could run to
several courses: soup, fish, poultry, meat, venison, dessert, plus
properly adjusted wines. After dessert the ladies disappeared, so that
the men might freely discourse on politics, horses, and women. Mme. de
Stael protested that this sexual dichotomy removed a main stimulant to
the refinement of manners and the enjoyment of society. Table manners
were not as elegant as in France.</p>
<p>Manners in general were hearty and rough. Speech was peppered with
profanity; the Archbishop of Canterbury complained, “The torrent of pro
- fanity every day makes more rapid advances.” 63 Fisticuffs were
frequent in the lower classes. Boxing was a favorite sport, and
prizefighting drew avid</p>
<p>370 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>patrons from all ranks. A doubly contemporary description has come
down to us from Robert Southey ( 1 807) :</p>
<p>When a match is made between two prize-fighters, the tidings are
immedi- ately communicated to the public in the newspapers; a paragraph
occasionally appears saying the rivals are in training, what exercise
they take, what diet — for some of them feed upon raw beef as a
preparative. Meantime the amateurs and the gamblers choose their party,
and the state of the bets appears also in the newspapers; not
infrequently the whole is a concerted scheme, that a few rogues may
cheat a great many fools. 64</p>
<p>Large crowds — sometimes twenty thousand — gathered for such
vicarious violence. Lord Althorp recommended the sport as a purification
of the ag- gressive instincts among the people, but the managers saw it
as a purgation of pocketbooks.</p>
<p>Poorer people sought catharsis by tying a bull or a bear to a post,
and baiting it with sticks and dogs — in some cases for two or three
days — till, in a moment of mercy, they put the victim to death or sent
it to the slaughter- house. 65 Cockfighting continued as a diversion
until forbidden in 1822. Cricket, which had been played in England as
far back as 1550, submitted to formal rules in the eighteenth century,
and offered the most stirring matches in the sporting year, with heavy
betting and wild partisanship in the im- mense crowds. Horse racing
provided another purge for gamblers, but there was in it, too, an
ancient affection for horses, and a loving care in breeding and training
them. The hunt was the summit of fashion in sports: the hunters riding
to the grounds in handsome coaches, the swift flight over fields and
crops, hedges, fences, and streams, on horses and after dogs breathing
plea- sure in the game.</p>
<p>Every class had its social gatherings, from the coffeehouses — where
simple men drank beer, smoked pipes, read newspapers, and talked
politics and philosophy — to the sumptuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton,
where lucred folk engaged in festivities “almost as gay in winter as in
summer.” 56 At home gatherings people played cards or other games, heard
music, or danced. The waltz had come in from Germany, and had been named
from walzen, to revolve. Moralists helped to make it popular by branding
it as sinful inti- macy. Coleridge, about 1798, complained convincingly:
“I am pestered every ball night to dance, which very modestly I refuse.
They dance a most infamous dance called the Waltzen. There are perhaps
twenty couples — the Man and his Partner embrace each other, arms and
waists, and knees almost touching, and then whirl round and round… to
lascivious music.” 57 The upper classes could arrange dances or other
parties at one of the fash- ionable clubs — Almack’s, White’s, Brook’s;
there too they could gamble for high stakes, and discuss the latest
performance of Mrs. Siddons, the frolics of the Prince, the novels of
Jane Austen, the engravings of Blake, the storms of Turner, the
landscapes of Constable. Among the Whigs the social pin- nacle was
Holland House, where Lady Holland held soirees at which one could meet
such dignitaries as Lord Brougham, Philippe Due d’Orleans, Talleyrand,
Metternich, Grattan, Mme. de Stael, Byron, Thomas Moore, or</p>

<p>he noblest Whig of them all, Charles James Fox. 58 No salon in France
could rival Holland House at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<li>THE ENGLISH THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>Add to all this varied life the English passion for the theater,
which rages to this day. And even as now the dramatists were of but
minor worth, and the actors were the play. The inescapable competition
of Shakespeare seemed to discourage the writing of tragedies; after the
heyday of Sheridan and Goldsmith the best new comedies were mortal
efforts like Thomas Hol- croft’s The Road to Ruin (1792) and Elizabeth
Inchbald’s Lovers’ Vows (1798), which clung to the frail line of
middle-class sentiment rather than the virile strain of Jonson’s lethal
laughter or Shakespeare’s philosophic fun. Only the actors were still at
the top of their form.</p>
<p>They seemed at first glance to be all of a family, which walked the
boards from Roger Kemble, who died in 1802, to Henry Kemble, who died
in</p>
<ol start="1907" type="1">
<li>Roger sired Sarah Kemble, who became Mrs. Siddons; John Philip
Kemble, who joined the Drury Lane company in 1783 and became its man-
ager in 1788; and Stephen Kemble, who managed the Edinburgh Theatre from
1792 to 1800.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sarah was bom in 1755, in the Shoulder-of-Mutton Inn at Brecon,
Wales, as an incident in the tour of her father’s troupe. As soon as she
could act she was given a role; she became a seasoned actress by the age
of ten. Amid her hectic life she managed to get considerable education;
she became a woman of mature and cultivated mind as well as professional
excellence and ageless charm. At eighteen she married William Siddons, a
minor member of her company. Two years later Garrick, having heard of
her success in the prov- inces, sent an agent to watch her perform. The
report being favorable, Gar- rick offered her an engagement at Drury
Lane, and she appeared there as Portia on December 29, 1775. She did not
do well, partly through nervous- ness, partly, perhaps, because she had
recently given birth. She was thin, tall, and grave; classic in features
and restraint; and her voice, accustomed to smaller theaters, failed to
fill the immense theater. After a disappointing sea- son she returned to
the provincial circuit, and for seven years she labored pa- tiently to
improve her art. In 1782 Sheridan, who had succeeded Garrick as manager,
persuaded her to return to London. On October 10, 1782, she took the
lead in Thomas Southerne’s century -old The Fatal Marriage; and her suc-
cess was so complete that from that evening she moved on to become the
finest tragedienne in British history. For twenty-one years she ruled at
Drury Lane, and for ten more she was the undisputed queen at Covent Gar-
den. To see her there as Lady Macbeth was the culminating experience of
a theatergoer’s life. When she reti red from the stage, on June 29,
1812, at the age of fifty-seven, she played that role, and the audience
was so moved by her performance of the sleepwalking scene that it
preferred to applaud her through the rest of the evening rather than let
the play go on. 59 For nineteen</p>
<p>37 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>years thereafter she lived in quiet retirement, cheating town
gossipers by her marital fidelity. Gainsborough triumphed with his
painting of her, and she reigns to this day in the National Portrait
Gallery.</p>
<p>Her brother John Philip Kemble, born like her in a provincial inn,
was destined by his parents for the Catholic priesthood, perhaps in the
popular theory that a member in holy orders would gain heaven for all
the family. He was sent to Douai to study in its Catholic college and
seminary; there he received a good classical education, and there he
acquired a clerical solem- nity that later clung to nearly all his
roles. But in that quiet environment the exciting career of his father
kept a secret fascination for him. At eighteen (1775) he left Douai and
returned to England; a year later he joined a the- atrical troupe; by
1781 he was playing Hamlet in Dublin. There for a time his sister Sarah
joined him, and thence she brought him with her to Drury Lane. 60 His
debut there as Hamlet (1783) was only a moderate success; the London
public found him too sedate for its taste, and the critics condemned him
for not only abbreviating but emendating Shakespea re’s text. However,
when he joined Mrs. Siddons in Macbeth (1785) their performance was
hailed as an event in the history of the English theater.</p>
<p>In 1788 Sheridan, then chief owner of the Drury Lane, appointed Kem-
ble manager of the company. He continued to fill the leading roles, but
Sheridan’s gay despotism and financial unreliability made the sensitive
actor uncomfortable. In 1803 he accepted the management of the Covent
Garden Theatre, and bought a sixth share of the enterprise for £ 23,000.
In 1808 the edifice burned down. After a costly idleness Kemble assumed
management of the rebuilt theater; but when he tried to offset the
unexpectedly high cost of the new structure by raising the price of
admission, the audience stopped his next perfor mance by persistent
cries of “Old prices!”; he was not al - lowed to continue until he
promised to restore them. 61 The Duke of North- umberland saved the
company with a gift of £ 10,000. Kemble struggled on, increasingly
challenged by younger actors. With a final triumph in Corio- lanus ,
when the same public that had hooted him in 1 809 shook the theater with
acclaim, he left the British stage, and surrendered his crown to Ed-
mund Kean. The classic style of acting disappeared from England with
him, as it was disappearing from France with his friend Talma; and the
Romantic movement triumphed in the theater as it was doing in painting,
music, poetry, and prose.</p>
<p>Kean’s life included all the vicissitudes of his high -strung
profession, all its humors and tragedies. He was born in a London slum
in 1787, as one result of a night’s outing between Aaron (or Edmund)
Kean, a stagehand, and Ann Carey, who earned a minimal living on the
stage and the street. Deserted in early childhood by his par ents, he
was brought up by his father’s brother, Moses Kean, a popular
entertainer, and more formally by Moses’ mistress, Charlotte Tidswell, a
minor actress at Drury Lane. She trained him in histrionic art and
tricks, while Moses made him study Shakespearean roles; the boy learned
everything that could hold a provincial audience, from acro- batics,
ventriloquism, and boxing to Hamlet and Macbeth. But he had way-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ENGLISH LIFE</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>wardness in his blood, and ran away repeatedly; at last Charlotte
bound a dog collar around his neck, inscribed “Drury Lane Theatre.” By
the age of fifteen he had shed the collar, and strayed off to an
independent career as an actor of any part, for fifteen shillings a
week.</p>
<p>For ten years he lived the hectic, exhausting life of a strolling
player, nearly always poor and humiliated, but burning with confidence
that he could outperform any man on the English stage. Soon, to forget
his toil and torments, he took to alcohol as favoring his dreams of his
supposedly noble birth and his forthcoming victories. In 1808 he married
Mary Chambers, a fellow trouper; she gave him two sons, and clove to him
through all his bouts with whiskey and women. Finally, after many years
of degrading al- ternations between Shakespearean parts and
impersonating an agile chimpan- zee, he received an invitation to a
trial appearance at Drury Lane.</p>
<p>For his debut there (January 26, 1814) he chose the difficult role of
Shy- lock. He poured into the role some of the resentments that life’s
indignities had stored up in him. When Shylock said, in scorn and
sarcasm, to the Chris- tian Venetian merchant asking for a loan,</p>
<p>Hath a dog money? Is it possible</p>
<p>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?,</p>
<p>Kean seemed to have forgotten that he was anyone other than Shylock;
and the passion, the violence, that he poured into the part put an end,
almost in two lines, to the classic era in English acting, and opened on
the London boards the era of feeling, imagination, and romance.
Gradually the audience, sparse and skeptical, was carried away by this
unknown actor, himself car- ried away by immersion in his part. Scene by
scene the response and applause grew, until, at the close, that
half-audience surrendered to him ecstatically. William Hazlitt, ablest
critic of the age, hurried off to write an enthusiastic review. Kean,
rushing home to his family, embraced his wife and child, say- ing to the
one, “Now, Mary, you shall ride in your carriage,” and to the boy, “My
son, you shall go to Eton!”® 2</p>
<p>At Kean’s second performance in The Merchant of Venice, the house was
full. After the third the reigning manager, Samuel Whitbread, gave Kean
the contract they had agreed upon for a three years’ engagement at eight
pounds a week; Kean signed; Whitbread took it and changed the eight
pounds to twenty. The time would come when Kean’s contract would call
for fifty pounds per night. He played almost all the famous
Shakespearean roles — Hamlet, Richard III, Richard II, Henry V, Macbeth,
Othello, Iago, Romeo. He succeeded in all but the last; the delicate
shades of Romeo’s aristocratic character eluded an actor too hardened
and embittered by the ruthless in- equalities of life.</p>
<p>When it came his turn to see young actors waiting eagerly to take his
place, he squandered his earnings in drink, fed on the idolatry of
tavern habitues, 63 joined a secret movement for “the damnation of all
lords an d gen- tlemen,” and was successfully sued for adultery with the
wife of a city alderman (182 5). 64 He paid the charges, and labored to
win back his place</p>

<p>in the theater; but his mind lost hold of the parts he played, and
more than once he forgot his lines. The audience was as merciless as it
had been idola- trous; it shouted insults at him, asked him why he drank
so heedlessly. He left England, toured America triumphantly, made
another fortune, squan- dered it. He returned to London, and agreed to
play Othello to his son’s Iago at Covent Garden (1833). The audience
acclaimed Iago, received Othello silently. The effort, unsupported by
applause, was too much for Kean; his strength ran out, and he neared
collapse. After speaking the line “Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s
gone” he fell into the arms of his son, and whispered to him, “Charles,
I am dying; speak to them for me.” 65 He was taken home; the wife whom
he had once abandoned took loving care of him. Two months later he died,
May 15, 1833, only forty-six years old. Life had broken in midlife the
greatest actor — barring Garrick — in English history.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>IN SUM</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, it was a virile and fruitful England. There were many
weak</p>
<p>spots in the picture, as in every picture true to life: the yeomanry
disappear- ing, the proletariat enslaved, drink and gambling ruining
fortunes and break- ing up homes; government frankly a class privilege,
and law made by a few men for other men and all women. And yet amid
these faults and crimes sci- ence was developing, philosophy was
ruminating, Constable was revealing English landscapes, Turner was
chaining the sun and stilling the storm, and Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Byron and Shelley were giving England a feast of poetry unequaled
anywhere since the first Elizabeth. Under all the tur- bulence there lay
a saving order and stability that allowed many freedoms — more than in
any other European state except in France, where excessive freedom had
committed suicide. There was freedom of movement and travel except in
war, freedom of worship this side of blasphemy, freedom of the press
this side of treason, freedom of opinion this side of advocating a
violent revolution which would, by all precedents, involve a decade or
more of bewildering lawlessness and insecurity.</p>
<p>It was not a highly educated public opinion; it often expressed
Mrs. Gump, and upheld outworn taboos; but it had the courage to boo a
degenerate prince and applaud his cruelly discarded wife. 66 It
expressed itself also in a hundred associations and societies dedicated
to education, science, philosophy, and reform. On critical issues it
expressed itself in public assemblies and exercised the right of
petition guaranteed by English law; and when it felt too heavily the
hand of an oligarchic state it took to resistance as the final stand of
pa- tient Englishmen; more than once a healthy riot ran through the
countryside and city streets.</p>
<p>The government was an aristocracy, but it was at least polite; it
trans- mitted manners, checked fads, and maintained standards of taste
against bar- barism in art and superstition in belief; it supported
several good causes, and kept its great poets from starvation. There was
an occasionally insane King,</p>

<p>but his claws had been cut, he had become helplessly lovable, and he
served as a symbol of national unity, a focus of national fervor and
pride; there seemed no sense in killing a million people to depose so
useful a master of ceremonies. After a bow or two an Englishman might
follow his own mood, go his own way, provided he did not insist upon the
equal rights of boot- blacks and baronets to make the laws of the land.
