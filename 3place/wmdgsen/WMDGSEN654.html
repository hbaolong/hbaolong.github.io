<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>The Changing Empire</p>
<p>1648-1715</p>
<p>I. THE REORGANIZATION OF GERMANY</p>
<p>T HE Thirty Years’ War had cut the population of Germany from</p>
<p>20,000,000 to 13,500,000. The soil, fertilized by human blood,
re-</p>
<p>covered in a year, but it waited for men. Of women there was an
excess, of men a dearth. The triumphant princes met this biological
crisis by a re- turn to Biblical polygamy. At the Congress of Franconia,
held in February, 1650, at Nuremberg, they adopted a resolution that</p>
<p>men under sixty years of age shall not be admitted to
monasteries.</p>
<p>. . . Priests and curates (if not ordained), and the canons of
religious establishments, shall marry . . . Every male shall be allowed
to marry two wives; and each and every male is earnestly reminded, and
shall often be warned from the pulpit, to so comport himself in this
matter. 1</p>
<p>Taxes were imposed upon unmarried women. 2 Soon the new births re-
stored the approximate equality of the sexes, and wives insisted on
whole husbands. Population rapidly recovered, and by 1700 Germany again
had 20,000,000 souls. Magdeburg was rebuilt; Leipzig and
Frankfurt-am-Main were reinvigorated by their fairs; Hamburg and Bremen
emerged stronger than before. Industry and commerce, however, took over
a hundred years to regain their sixteenth-century level. The Swedes and
the Dutch con- trolled the mouths of the Oder, the Elbe, and the Rhine,
and oceanic trans- port was leaving inland traffic relatively becalmed.
The middle classes declined. The towns were now ruled not by businessmen
but by the terri- torial princes or their appointees.</p>
<p>The war had ended in disaster for the Imperial Hapsburg power. France
had humbled it, and had humbled the Empire’s ally, Spain. The German
princes were now collectively stronger than the emperor. They had their
own armies, courts, and coinage, determined their own foreign policies,
formed their own alliances with non-German states, even against the Im-
perial interest. There were now some two hundred “temporal” principali -
ties enjoying such independence; sixty-three ecclesiastical states ruled
by Roman Catholic archbishops, bishops, or abbots; and fifty- one “free
cities,”</p>
<p>4 1 1</p>
<p>412 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XIV</p>
<p>subject only to the emperor, and only formally to him. France
rejoiced to see so many Germanies rather than one.</p>
<p>The margraviate of Brandenburg was the symbol of the Empire dying, of
a new Germany taking form. There, far from the emperor, facing</p>
<p>Sweden and an ocean of Slavs, the Hohenzollem family learned that
their little state could survive only through its own resources and
force. Back in the tenth century Henry the Fowler had established the “
Northern Mark 〔i.e., frontier〕 of the Saxons” along the Elbe as a
bulwark against the Slavic inundation. He wrested from the Slavic Wends
their fortress and capital of Brennibor (from which the name Brandenburg
was derived), and drove them back to the Oder. For centuries the
territory between the Elbe and the Oder changed hands between the
Germans and the Slavs. The margraviate came more actively into history
when Frederick of Hohen- zollern, in 141 1-17, purchased it and its
electoral vote in the Imperial Diet. From that time onward the house of
Hohenzollem governed Brandenburg till it became Prussia, and Prussia
till the abdication of William II in 1918. Rarely has a family been so
long and so intimately associated with a state, or devoted itself so
zealously and effectively to a nation’s prosperity and aggrandizement.
Under the Elector John Sigismund (1608-19) Branden- burg acquired the
duchy of Cleve in the west and the duchy of East</p>
<p>Prussia in the east, so that the margraviate already presaged the
kingdom of Prussia. One of the weakest members of the family was the
Elector George William (1619- 40), whose vacillations in the Thirty
Years’ War led to the devastation of Brandenburg by Swedish troops.
Villages and towns were deserted, Berlin was laid waste, industry almost
disappeared; the population of the margraviate fell from 600,000 to
210,000. Inheriting this desolation (1640), Frederick William
accomplished in his reign of forty-eight years such a miracle of
restoration and development that even his contemporaries yielded him the
name “Great Elector.” Without him Frederick the Great (as Frederick the
Great admitted 3 ) would have been impossible.</p>
<p>He was twenty when he came to power — a handsome, black-haired,
dark-eyed youth breaking authority. He had been reared in piety and
disci- pline, and had completed his schooling at the University of
Leiden. Antici- pating Peter of Russia, he admired the Dutch people,
their sturdy courage and industrious ways; later he brought in thousands
of them to repopulate his man-hungry land. At the Peace of Westphalia he
obtained eastern (Farther) Pomerania, the bishoprics of Minden and
Halberstadt, and the right of succession to the important archbishopric
of Magdeburg; this fell to him in 1680, and Frederick William ended his
reign with a scattered realm already straining to be a kingdom. As early
as 1654 his chief min- ister, Count George Frederick of Waldeck,
proposed to unite all Germany</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>THE CHANGING EMPIRE</p>
<p>413</p>
<p>under the Hohenzollern house. 4 Frederick William seemed the man to
undertake this protective union. When Augustus the Strong of Saxony
became a Catholic to be King of Poland, the road to Protestant
leadership of Germany lay open — except for Swedish power.</p>
<p>For the treaties of 1648 had left some of the most strategic points
in Germany under Swedish control, and Sweden claimed the leadership of
Protestant Germany by right of its sacrifices and victories in the
Thirty Years’ War. How could Brandenburg -Prussia, with its constituent
parts hedged in by rival states from one end of Germany to the other,
become strong enough to defend itself against domination by Sweden, or
by a Saxony central and unified? Frederick William began with a plan and
a will, which are the first principle of statesmanship; then, by taxes
and French subsidies, he raised money, which is the second principle of
states- manship; then, with money, he organized an Army, which is the
third principle of statesmanship. By 1656 he had the first standing army
in Europe — eighteen thousand trained men permanently in arms. With this
per- suasive he induced his constituent state s to pay an annual
“contribution” to the central government at Berlin; with these revenues
he became inde- pendent of the power of the purse in the provincial
diets; and he achieved what appeared to him to be the only practical
form of government in the existing stage of political and intellectual
development — absolute and cen- tralized rule. He exempted the nobles
from direct taxation, but required their sons to serve him as Junker in
the higher ranks of the army and the administration. These “juniors” at
first resented such service; but he gave them splendid uniforms and
social prominence, trained them in competence and pride, and developed
in them an esprit de corps that replaced the feudal loyalties of the old
regime and made the army serve not the land- owners but the government.
So began the military and social machine that enabled Frederick the
Great to stand up against half of Europe, and that prepared Germany for
the First World War.</p>
<p>One quality Frederick William did not have — the military genius of
the Swedish kings. For twenty years he shifted his force from side to
side in the conflicts of Sweden with Poland and of the Empire with
France, barely preserving himself by diplomacy. But when Charles XI
invaded Branden- burg, Frederi ck William’s army justified itself by
defeating the Swedes at Fehrbellin (1675); it was this victory that won
him the title of Great</p>
<p>Elector. In the end, despite his fluctuating policies and narrow
resources, he added forty thousand square miles to his state.</p>
<p>More important were his economic and adminstrative reforms. Under his
urging the nobles improved agricultural methods, and expanded the yield,
on their estates. He developed a prosperous silk industry by the
extensive planting of mulberry trees. He reversed the trend to
deforestation</p>
<p>414</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>by requiring peasants to plant twelve trees before they married. He
planned and financed the building of the Frederick William Canal to
connect the Oder with the Spree. When Louis XIV revoked the Edict of
Nantes, the Great Elector issued an “Edict of Potsdam” (November, 1685),
inviting the distressed Huguenots to come and settle in
Brandenburg-Prussia; he sent agents to guide and finance their
migration;® twenty thousand came, proved a spur to Prussian industry,
and formed five regiments in the Prussian army. Frederick William
himself, like his descendant Frederick the Great, labored assiduously in
administration, and established the prin- ciple, later accepted by Peter
of Russia and the “enlightened despots” of the eighteenth century, that
the ruler should be the dedicated servant of the state. He recognized
that religious intolerance was an obstacle to economic and political
development; he distinguished himself in Germany by allowing his people
to remain Lutheran while he himself remained Calvinist; and he gave
religious freedom to Catholics, Unitarians, and Jews.</p>
<p>He died in 1688, aged sixty-eight. His will, dividing his several
states among his sons, would have canceled the unifying effect of his
rule, but his successor repudiated the document and maintained the
central power. Frederick III earned the good will of the Emperor Leopold
I by joining him against France; for this, and eight thousand soldiers,
Leopold granted him the title of Konig in Preussen. He was crowned
Frederick I at Konigs- berg on January 18, 1701, and Prussia began its
career toward Bismarck and German unity.</p>
<p>It is a plume in Fre derick’s record that he founded the University
of</p>
<p>Halle; another that he supported the efforts of his second wife to
promote the intellectual graces in Berlin. Sophia Charlotte, daughter of
the Electress Sophia of Hanover, was reputed to be the prettiest and
wittiest woman in Germany. From her long stay in Paris she brought to
the court of Berlin an attractive union of culture and charm. Urged on
by her and Leibniz, Frederick established the Berlin Academy of
Sciences, destined to make history under Frederick II. For her the
Elector built (1696) the famous Schloss — castle or palace — in the
suburb that took her name, Charlotten- burg. To her salon in the Schloss
Charlottenburg came scientists, philoso- phers, freethinkers, Jesuits,
and Lutheran ministers; Charlotte loved to prod them into theological
battles that sometimes lasted through the night. There her
sister-in-law, Queen Caroline of England, drank in the learning and art
that were to startle England. When Charlotte died (if we may believe her
grandson Frederick the Great) she rejected both Catholic and Prot-
estant offers of religious ministrations; she told the divines that she
was dying in peace, and rather in curiosity than in hope or fear; now,
she said, she would satisfy her inquisitiveness about the origin of
things, “which even</p>

<p>THE CHANGING EMPIRE</p>
<p>415</p>
<p>husband with the thought that her death would “afford hi m the oppor-
tunity of giving me a magnificent funeral.” 6 Sophia Charlotte was among
the many women of character and education who adorned Germany as the
seventeenth slipped into the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The court of Berlin, among the more than three hundred that then con-
sumed the revenues of the Empire, was rivaled only by the Saxon court at
Dresden. Augustus the Strong, who ruled Saxony (1694-1733) as Elector
Frederick Augustus I, bequeathed to Europe a bevy of bastards, among
them the famous M arechal de Saxe. He made his capital “the prettiest
city in Germany,” 7 the center and pride of the minor arts; but the
Saxons could not forgive him his change of faith, his use of their money
and men in Poland’s wars, and the costly luxuries of his court.</p>
<p>The Electorate of Hanover contributed to history in this period by
shel- tering Leibniz and annexing England. In 1658 Sophia, the dethroned
Prin- cess Palatine, daughter of Elizabeth Stuart (Queen of Bohemia),
married Ernest Augustus, who became Elector of Hanover. Her erudition
discom- fited her husband, for she spoke five languages with few
interruptions, and knew more English history than the English
ambassadors at her court. For a time she maintained at Hanover a salon
of scholars and philosophers. But her consuming passion was to secure
the throne of England for her son George; her blood tingled with
royalty, for she never forgot that she was the granddaughter of James I.
In 1701 the English Parliament, as we have seen, settled the succession
to the throne upon Sophia and “the heirs of her body, being Protestant.”
She contemplated with pleasure the future of her son as George I, but
without pleasure the prospect of her daughter-in-law, Sophia Dorothea,
as a queen; and she looked with equanimity upon the breakup of their
marriage. George, suspecting his wife of adultery with Count Philipp von
Konigsmarck, had him killed, divorced Sophia Dorothea, and imprisoned
her from 1694 till her death in 1726. Meanwhile the Electress Dowager
died in June, 1714, aged eighty-four, just two months before the crown
of England descended upon the head of her son. So the great god Chance,
from his ubiquitous throne, shuffled the fates and states and men.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE GERMAN SOUL</li>
</ol>
<p>The struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism for the soul of
Ger- many was moderating its violence, for the Thirty Years’ War had
brought theological hatreds to a reductio ad absurdum. Largely through
Jesuit per- suasion some Protestant princes went over to the Roman
Church in this period. Calvinism gained on Lutheranism, which tended to
a stiff Scholastic</p>
<p>41 6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>dogmatism. Chiefly in reaction to this formalism the Pietist movement
spread, seeking to replace outward observances with an inner spirit of
union with God. In the second half of the seventeenth century George
Fox, Wil- liam Penn, and Robert Barclay carried their Quaker gospel to
Germany, and perhaps this missionary movement shared in developing
Pietism there; we note that Philipp Jakob Spener’s Pia desideria (1675)
appeared four years after Penn’s first visit. Spener, as pastor of a
Lutheran church in Frankfurt-am-Main, supplemented its services with the
mystic devotions of private assemblies ( collegia pietatis) in his home.
The name Pietist, like Puritan and Methodist, was given to these
devotees by their critics as a term of ridicule; it was accepted by
them, and became a badge of humble pride. They clung with fervor to the
millenarian hopes that had consoled some of the German masses during the
war. They thought of the Second Advent not as a vague doctrine of
theology, but as a warm and active in- spiration of their daily lives.
At any moment now Christ would reappear on earth; he would still the
strife! of faiths and end the reign of force and war; he would establish
a purely “spiritual church,” without organization, without ritual,
without priests, but practicing with joy a generous Chris- tianity of
the heart.</p>
<p>August Francke carried on the movement with the ardor of a prophet.
Many women were touched by his practical Christianity and enlisted in
the cause of personal piety and public charity. Influenced by English
Puritan- ism and French Quietism, the movement in turn influenced
English Meth- odism and German poetry, and made itself felt in America,
where Cotton Mather hailed it hopefully: “The world begins to feel a
warmth from the fire of God, which thus flames in the heart of Germ
any.” 8 But Pietism, like Puritanism, injured itself by making its piety
public and professional, some- times falling into affectation and cant.
In the eighteenth century it was swamped by the rationalist flood that
poured in from France.</p>
<p>The successes of Richelieu, Mazarin, and Louis XIV, and the growing
wealth and splendor of the French court, had an irresistible influence
upon German society in the century following the Peace of Westphalia.
For a time cosmopolitanism overcame nationalism. French ways dominated
the princely courts in language, literature, liaisons, manners, dances,
art, philosophy, wine, and wigs. The German aristocracy now spoke German
chiefly to servants. German authors wrote in French for the upper
classes or in Latin for the learned world. Leibniz, who wrote mostly in
French, admitted that German “manners have been somewhat modified toward
ele - gance and politeness” by French example, but mourned the
replacement or infiltration of German speech by the language or phrases
of France. 9</p>
<p>Only one German book of this age has survived — the Simplicius
Simpli- cissimus (1669) of Hans von Grimmelshausen. In form it is the
picaresque</p>
<p>CHAP, xrv)</p>
<p>THE CHANGING EMPIRE</p>
<p>4*7</p>
<p>episodic autobiography of Melchior von Fuchshaim, who is one-quarter
fool, one-quarter philosopher, and one-half rogue. In spirit it is a
good- humored but pessimistic satire on the Germany that was left barely
alive after thirty years of war. Melchior begins as the foster child of
a peasant, whose life is described in courtly terms:</p>
<p>Instead of pages, lackeys, and hostlers my sire had sheep, goats, and
pigs, and each waited upon me on the chase until I drove them home.</p>
<p>His armory was well provided with plows, mattocks, axes, hoes,</p>
<p>shovels, dung forks and hay forks, wherewith he practiced every day,
for hoeing and digging were his disciplina militaris; . . . drawing
out</p>
<p>manure was his science of fortification, holding the plow his
strategy, cleaning out the stable his knightly diversion, his
tournament. 10</p>
<p>A band of soldiers breaks into this peasant paradise, and tortures
the family to make it reveal nonexistent hoards. Melchior escapes and
finds refuge with an old hermit, who gives him his first lessons in
theology. Asked for his name, he answers, “Rascal or scape - gallows,”
for he has never heard him - self otherwise addressed; his foster-
father’s name, on the same basis, was “clown, ruffian, drunken dog.”
Captured by soldiers, he is taken to the court of the governor of Hanau;
there he is trained to be a fool, and is christened Simplicius
Simplicissimus. He is kidnaped, becomes a thief, finds a hidden
treasure, becomes a gentleman, seduces a girl, is forced to marry her,
deserts her, becomes a Catholic, visits the center of the earth, loses
his fortune, recoups it by quackery, wearies of wandering, and retires
to lead the life of a hermit disillusioned with the world. This is
Candide a century before Voltaire, except that its satire is softened
with German humor rather than graced with Gallic wit. The book was
condemned by the critics, and became a classic, the most famous
production of German literature between Luther and Lessing.</p>
<p>We must not take it as a fair picture of Germany in the generation
after the war. The German might be too fond of drink, but he kept his
bubbling good humor even in his cups; his wife might call him a drunken
dog, but she loved him faute de mieux, and reared his children sturdily.
Perhaps there was a more wholesome morality in the Germany of this age
than in France. Poor Charlotte Elisabeth, Princess Palatine, married
(1671) against her wishes to “Monsieur” Philipps d’Orleans, the invert
widower of “Madame” Henrietta, never forgot the cool loveliness of
Heidelberg; and after forty- three year’s of uncomfortable living with
the comforts of the French court, she still longed for “a good dish of
sauerkraut and smoked sausages” as far preferable to the coffee, tea, or
chocolate of Paris or Versailles. 11 Her stoic fidelity to her worthless
husband, and her patience with the royal brother- in-law who ordered or
permitted the devastation of the Palatinate, show</p>

<p>us that even amid the ruins of Germany there were women who could
teach decency and humanity to beribboned, embroidered, periwigged,
perfumed kings.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE ARTS IN GERMANY</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, and contrary to all reasonable expectations, this age was
one of the most productive in German architecture. It saw the first
flowering of German baroque, which gave a new front of charm and gaiety
to Karls- ruhe, Mannheim, Dresden, Bayreuth, Wurzburg, and Vienna. It
was the time of builders like Johann Fischer von Erlach, Jakob
Prandtauer, Johann and Kilian and Cristoph Dientzenhofer, and Andreas
Schliiter, whose names would be as well known to English-speaking
peoples as those of Wren and Inigo Jones, were it not for the prison of
frontiers and the babel of tongues. Some of their work, however, was
destroyed in the invasions of Germany by French armies (1689), and some
in the Second World War. 12 History is a race between art and war.</p>
<p>Some lovely churches rose amid the poverty and desolation. We should
dishonor our record if we found no line for Johann Dientzenhofer’s cathe
- dral at Fulda or his abbey church at Banz, or for the work of
Christoph and Kilian Dientzenhofer on the churches of St. Nicholas and
St. John in</p>
<p>Prague. In 1663 the Italian architect Agostino Barelli began the
Nymphen- burg Palace outside Munich, and Joseph Effner completed its
interior in a successful merger of classic pilasters and baroque
decoration. Ornament was the besetting temptation of baroque; it went to
excess in the Festsaal, or Festival Salon, of the Schloss Berlin, and in
the pavilion of the Zwinger Palace built at Dresden by Matthaus Daniel
Poppelmann for Augustus the Strong; here baroque passed into a pretty
rococo rather befitting a boudoir interior than a palace front. This was
mostly destroyed in the Second World War; so were the Schloss
Charlottenburg and the Schloss Berlin, the royal palace begun by Andreas
Schliiter in 1698.</p>
<p>Schliiter was the outstanding German sculptor of the age. All Germany
was thrilled by his equestrian statue of the Great Elector, Der Gross e
Kurfiirst, which withstood all the bombs of war, and now rides the Char-
lottenburg plaza outside Berlin. At Konigsberg Schliiter set up an
equally imposing figure of Frederick I, just made King of Prussia.
Julius Glessker carved a quietly mourning Head of Mary for a Crucifixion
group in the cathedral at Bamberg. The wood carvers showed their skill
in the mag- nificent choir stalls of the Klosterkirche in Silesia, but
they went to excess in the extravagantly carved furniture demanded by
patrons who had more pride than taste.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE CHANGING.EMPIRE 419</p>
<p>German painting begot no masterpieces in this period, unless we count
as such a charming Young Man with a Gray Hat by Christoph Paradiso. 13
The tapestries designed for the Wurzburg Palace by Rudolf Byss are among
the finest; and Paul Decker’s engraving s in copper were near the top of
their kind. The little town of Warmbrunn — the Warm Springs of Silesia —
was famous for its cut glass; Dresden made “Dresden china” fash -
ionable; Augustus the Strong was also le roi de faience; and at Meissen,
suitable clays having been found nearby, he established (1709) the kilns
that produced the first hard porcelain in Europe.</p>
<p>But it is in music that the German spirit found its most
characteristic ex- pression; this, so to speak, was the eve of Johann
Sebastian Bach. The forms and instruments came from Italy, but the
Germans poured into them their own tender sentiment and massive piety,
so that while Italy excelled in melody and France in graceful rhythm,
Germany moved toward primacy in lieder, organ music, a nd chorales. In
G. F. Krieger’s 12 Suonate a due Violini (1688) the sonata sequence is
already established in three move- ments — allegro, largo, and presto.
Instrumental music, rising out of dance forms (pavan, saraband, gavotte,
gigue, etc.), was declaring its independ- ence of both dance and
voice.</p>
<p>Italian musicians were still in demand in Germany. Cavalli reigned in
Munich, as Vivaldi later in Darmstadt. Italian opera was imported, and
had its first performance in Germany at Torgau (1627); others followed
at Regensburg, Vienna, and Munich. The first German opera, called a
Sing- spiel, was Johann Theile’s Adam und Eva, produced at Hamburg in
1678; from that time, for half a century, Hamburg held the leadership m
German opera and drama. There Handel brought out his Almira and Nero in
1705, and his Daphne and Florinda in 1706, before going to conquer
England. The great name in the German opera of this period is Reinhard
Keiser, who produced 116 operas for the Hamburg company.</p>
<p>After 1644 German composers won pre-eminence from the Italians in
compositions for the organ and the church. The hymns of Paul Gerhardt
expressed his uncompromising Lutheranism. Jan Reinken dominated the
organ in the Katherinenkirche at Hamburg from 1663 till his death at the
age of ninety-nine in 1722. Dietrich Buxtehude, bom in Denmark, became
organist in the Marienkirche at Liibeck in 1668; his performances there,
and especially his Abendmusik concerts for organ, orchestra, and chorus,
were so renowned that in 1705 the great Bach walked fifty miles from
Arn- stadt to Liibeck to hear him play. 14 Nearly seventy of his
compositions for the organ have survived; many are still performed; and
his chorales shared in forming Johann Sebastian’s style. Johann Kuhnau
preceded Bach as organist at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig; he developed
the sonata, for the clavier, and composed Partien of the same type as
Bach’s suites.</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>The Bach family was now entering upon the musical scene in bewilder-
ing profusion. We know of some four hundred Bachs between 1550 and 1850:
all musicians, sixty of them holding important posts in the musical
world of their time. They formed a kind of family guild, meeting period-
ically at their headquarters in Eisenach, Amstadt, or Erfurt. They
consti- tute unquestionably the most extensive and remarkable dynasty in
cultural history, impressive not merely by their number, but by devotion
to their art, by a typically Germanic steadiness of purpose, and by
their produc- tivity and influence. They do not come prominently into
musical annals until their fifth generation, with Johann Christoph and
Johann Michael Bach, sons of Heinrich Bach, organist at Amstadt. Johann
Christoph was chief organist at Eisenach for thirty-eight years: a
simple, serious, painstak- ing man who trained choirs and composed for
organ and for orchestra. His brother Johann Michael became organist at
Gehren in 1673, remained there till his death in 1694, and gave his
fifth daughter to be the first wife of Johann Sebastian. Heinrich’s
brother Christoph Bach, organist at Weimar, had twin sons who were
violinists; one of them, Ambrosius, was Johann Sebastian’s f ather.
Johann Bach, brother of Heinrich and Christoph, was organist at Erfurt
from 1647 till 1673, when he was succeeded by his son Johann Christian
Bach, who in 1682 was succeeded by his brother Johann Egidius Bach. All
the forces of nature seem to have been directed to pro- duce and prepare
Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>

<li>AUSTRIA AND THE TURKS</li>
</ol>
<p>Vienna is so beautiful today that we find it hard to picture it after
the Thirty Years’ War. Austria had not suffered so severely as Germany,
but its treasury was exhausted, its armies were in disgrace, and the
Peace of Westphalia had lowered the prestige and power of the emperors.
One cir- cumstance was favorable: Leopold I succeeded his father
Ferdinand III on the Imperial throne in 1658, and held it for
forty-seven years; and though that long reign heard the Turks again
knocking at Vienna’s gates, the recovery of Austria was proceeding
rapidly. Only formally sovereign over the German principalities, Leopold
was actual king of Bohemia and western Hungary, and governed the duchies
of Styria, Carinthia, and Camiola, and the county of Tirol. He was not a
great ruler; he labored dutifully in administration and the formation of
policy, but he lacked the far vision of his Hapsburg forebears,
inheriting only their theology and their chin. He had originally been
trained for the priesthood; he never lost his affection for the Jesuits,
or strayed much from their guidance. Though himself of irreproachable
morals, he accepted the principle that all his sub-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>THE CHANGING EMPIRE</p>
<p>4 il</p>
<p>jects must be made Catholic; and he enforced this policy with hard
autoc- racy in Bohemia and Hungary. He was inclined to peace, but was
forced or led into a succession of wars by the aggressions of Louis XIV
and the Turks. Between these bloodlettings he found time for poetry,
art, and music; he composed music himself, and encouraged opera in
Vienna; four hundred new operas were presented there in the fifty years
after his acces- sion. An engraving of 1667 shows already a sumptuous
opera house, with three tiers of boxes, every seat taken; so old is that
pleasant scaffolding for song.</p>
<p>We must think of Austria in this age as defending the West against
re- surgent Turkey, and harassed by the enmity of the strongest ruler in
the West; the struggle of Christendom against Islam was hampered and
con- fused by the old conflict of the Hapsburgs with France. Hungary
further complicated the problem, for only the western third of it was
under the emperor, part of this was Protestant, and all of it longed to
be free. The Hungarians had their own nationalist sentiment, fed by
their literature and their proud traditions of Hunyadi Janos and
Matthias Corvinus; only re- cently (1651) Miklos Zrinyi had published an
epic throbbing with patriot- ism. Insulted and oppressed by Austrian
rule and Catholic domination, the Hungarians were half inclined to
welcome the Turks when these decided to attempt the conquest of all
Hungary.</p>
<p>A succession of powerful viziers had interrupted the decline of
Turkey, and resumed the harrowing of the West. It was one symptom of the
re- covery that a major Turkish poet, Nabi, sang the praises of the
viziers who filled his palm; another that Turkish funds and taste and
piety could raise the lovely Mosque of Yeni-Valide in Stamboul
(1651-80). Sultan Moham- med IV appointed as his grand vizier (1656)
Mohammed Kuprili, who at the age of seventy inaugurated half a century
of rule by his Albanian family. His own vizierate lasted only five
years, but in that quinquennium he had 36,000 persons executed for
crimes ranging from theft to treason; his chief executioner averaged
three stranglings per day. Corruption in the admin- istration and
political intrigue in the harem were frightened into modera- tion,
discipline was restored in the army, and the provincal pashas reduced
their independence and embezzlements. When George Rakoczy II, Prince of
Transylvania, repudiated Turkish suzerainty, Kuprili overwhelmed the
revolt with an army under his own leadership, deposed Rakoczy, exacted a
heavy indemnity, and increased from fifteen thousand to fifty thousand
florins Transylvania’s annual tribute to the Sultan.</p>
<p>The terrible septuagenarian was succeeded as vizier by his son Ahmed
Kuprili. When another revolt broke out in Transylvania, led by John</p>
<p>Kemenyi, Emperor Leopold sent to its support ten thousand men under
one of the outstanding generals of this age, the Italian Count Raimondo
di</p>
<p>4 22</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>Montecucculi. Ahmed retaliated by leading 120,000 troops in an effort
to complete the conquest of Hungary. Leopold appealed for help; the
German states, Protestant as well as Catholic, responded with money and
men; and Louis XIV, abandoning his alliance with Turkey, contributed
four thou- sand soldiers. Even so, resistance seemed hopeless; Europe
expected Vienna to fall; Leopold prepared to aban don his capital.
Montecucculi’s forces were far outnumbered, but better equipped with
artillery. Not daring to meet the Turks in open terrain, where numbers
would count, he maneuvered them into an attempted crossing of the River
Raba at Szentgotthard, some eighty miles south of Vienna, and attacked
each Turkish detachment as it arrived on the left bank. His strategy,,
and the special heroism of the French contingent, won the day (August 1,
1664) in a battle that again saved Europe from Moslem inundation.</p>
<p>But just as, a century before (1571), the victory of Lepanto had left
the Turks still strong and rapidly recovering, so now their power of
recupera- tion, their still immense army, and the unreliability of
Leopold’s allies, anxious to return home, led the Emperor to sign with
the Sultan a twenty- year truce (August 10, 1664) which left most of
Hungary under Turkish rule, acknowledged Turkish sovereignty over
Transylvania, and paid the Sultan a “gift” of 200,000 florins. Ahmed
Kuprili, having lo st the battle and won the war, returned to
Constantinople in triumph.</p>
<p>The attack of Louis XIV upon the Netherlands (1667) ended for the</p>
<p>time being the Christian union against the Turks. In 1669 Ahmed took
command of the long siege of Crete, and forced the Venetians to
surrender the island; the Turkish fleet was again dominant in the
Mediterranean. Only John Sobieski, King of Poland, had a stomach strong
enough, he felt, to swallow Turkey. He announced hi s aim bravely: “To
give the barbarian conquest for conquest, to pursue him from victory to
victory, over the very frontier that belched him forth from Europe, … to
hurl him back into the deserts, to exterminate him, to raise upon his
ruins the Empire of Byzantium: this enterprise alone is Christian; this
alone is noble, wise.” 15 However, Leopold encouraged the Turks to
attack Poland, and Louis urged them to attack Leopold. 10</p>
<p>Ahmed Kuprili died in 1676, worn out at the age of forty-one by so
many brilliant defeats, having lost “decisive battles” and extended the
Turkish dominion to its European maximum. Sultan Mohammed IV gave the
viz- ierate to his son-in-law Kara Mustafa, who delighted Louis XIV by
promis- ing to renew the war against Austria. 17 Kara was encouraged by
a revolt (1678) of Hungarian nationalists under Imre Thokoly, who so
resented the violent suppression of nationalism and Protestantism in
Austrian Hun- gary that he offered to recognize Turkish suzerainty over
all Hungary if the Turks would aid his rebellion. Leopold, too late,
abandoned the policy</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE CHANGING EMPIRE 423</p>
<p>of repression, and proclaimed religious toleration in Hungary. Louis
XIV sent financial support to Thokoly, 18 and promised Sobieski the
possession of Silesia and Hungary if he would ally Poland with France
against the Emperor. Leopold could only offer Sobieski an archduchess as
bride for his son, and a pledge to support Sob ieski’s effort to make
the Polish throne hereditary in his famliy line. We do not fully know
the King’s motives in coming to the aid of Austria against the Turks; we
can only say that it was one of the most dramatic and pivotal events in
modem history.</p>
<p>Kara Mustafa felt that the feuds between Hapsburg and Bourbon, be-
tween Catholicism and Protestantism, offered him an opportunity to take
Vienna, perhaps all Europe. The Turks boasted that in the fifteenth cen-
tury they had turned Constantinople, capital of the Eastern Roman
Empire, into a Moslem citadel, and St. Sophia’s into a mosque; so now,
they de - clared, they would not stop till they had taken Rome and
stabled their horses in St. Peter’s nave. 19 In 1682 Kara assembled at
Adrianople his lev ies of men and supplies from Arabia, Syria, the
Caucasus, Asia Minor, and European Turkey, pretending that he planned to
attack Poland. On March 31, 1683, the Sultan and the Vizier started on
their long march to Vienna. As the army advanced it added reinforcements
from each Turkish province on the way; Wallachian, Moldavian, and
Transylvanian contingents joined it; when it reached Osijek (Eszek) on
the Drava, it numbered 250,000 men, and included camels, elephants,
muezzins, eunuchs, and a harem. 20 There Thokoly issued a manifesto,
calling upon the surrounding Christians to support the attack upon
Austria, and promising them security of life and property, and freedom
of religious worship, under the Sultan. Many towns opened their gates to
the invaders.</p>
<p>Leopold again appealed to the German principalities; they responded
sluggishly. He placed his 40,000 troops under the command of Charles V,
Duke of Lorraine, whom Voltaire described as one of the noblest princes
in Christendom. 21 Leaving a garrison of 13,000 in Vienna, Charles
retreated with his main force to Tuln, where he waited for the Poles.
Leopold fled to Passau, while his people condemned him for having failed
to prepare his capital for the long-expected siege. Its fortifications
were dilapidated, its garrison was not a tenth of the advancing foe. On
July 14 the Turks ap- peared before the walls. Leopold sent messengers
to Sobieski begging him to come at once, ahead of his slowly moving
infantry; “your n ame alone, so terrible to the enemy, will ensure a
victory.” 22 Sobieski came with 3,000 cavalry. On September 5 his
infantry arrived, 23,000 strong. Two days later 18,000 men came from the
German states; the Christian army now num- bered 60,000. But by this
time Vienna was starving, its forts were crumbling under the Turkish
artillery; another week of siege, and the city would fall.</p>
<p>Early on September 1 2 the Christians, now under the supreme
command</p>
<p>424 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XIV</p>
<p>of Sobieski, attacked the besiegers. Kara Mustafa had not believed
that the Poles would come, much less that the Christian forces would
take the initiative; he had organized everything for siege rather than
for battle; his officers had adorned their trenches with tapestries and
tiles, and he himself had equipped his tent with baths, fountains,
gardens, and concu- bines. His best troops, caught by surprise in their
trenches, were cut to pieces. His motley army, gathered from provinces
unstirred with loyalty to the distant Sultan, fell into disorder before
Christians inspired by the feeling that they were saving Europe and
Christianity. After eight hours darkness interrupted the conflict. When
the next dawn came the Christians, still uncertain of victory,
discovered to their joy that the Turks had fled, leaving 10,000 dead,
and most of the army’s materials behind in the camp. The Christians lost
3,000 men.</p>
<p>Sobieski wanted to pursue, but the Polish soldiers begged him to let
them go home now that their main task was done. The victorious King
entered Vienna and its cathedral to give thanks to God; on his route the
grateful people hailed him as a divine deliverer, and struggled to touch
his garment and kiss his feet; 23 they felt that nothing in the annals
of chivalry could out- shine his deed. When Leopold returned to his
capital (September 15) he was coldly received by the populace. He
inquired of his aides whether a merely elective monarch had ever been
received by an emperor, and what formalities should be observed; he
delayed meeting Sobieski, and finally greeted him with quite moderate
gratitude; he suspected that the hero’s desire to pursue the Turks was
due to a plan to carve out an added kingdom for himself and his family.
24 So the pursuit was not begun till September 17, and not till ten days
later was contact made with the retreating Turks. At Parkany, near the
Danube, Sobieski and Charles again won a decisive victory. Then, his
army weakened with marching, fighting, and dysentery, the King led it
back to Poland, entering Cracow on Christmas Eve, 1683. On the following
day the Sultan put Kara Mustafa to death.</p>
<p>At the urging of Pope Innocent XI Austria, Poland and Venice formed a
Holy League to carry on the war against the Turks (1684). Francesco
Morosini reconquered the Morea (the Peloponnesus) for Venice; in 1687 he
laid siege to Athens, and captured it on September 28; in the process
his artillery ruined the Propylaea and the Parthenon, which the Turks
had used as a magazine for their powder. The Turks recaptured Athens and
Attica in 1688, the Morea in 1715. Meanwhile Charles of Lorraine
defeated the Turks at Gran (Esztergom) in 1685, and in the same year,
after ten weeks’ siege, took Buda — the ancient capital of Hungary —
which the Turks had held since 1541. In 1687 Charles led the Austrian
forces to triumph at Harkany, near Mohacs, where the victory of Suleiman
the Magnificent in 1526 had begun the Turkish ascendancy. This “second
Mohacs” ended</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE CHANGING EMPIRE 425</p>
<p>the Turkish power in Hungary, which now became a possession of the
Austrian monarchy. Transylvania acknowledged the suzerainty of the
Hapsburg emperor, and was incorporated (1690) into the Austro-Hun-
garian Empire. In 1688 Max Emanuel of Bavaria took Belgrade. Leopold
proclaimed that now the road was open to Constantinople, and that the
time and opportunity had come to drive the Turks from Europe.</p>
<p>Louis XIV came to their rescue. The war of Bourbon against Hapsburg
seemed to the “Most Christian King” more important than the conflict
between Christianity and Islam. He looked with mounting jealousy upon
the successes of the Holy League and the extension of the Hapsburg realm
and prestige. In 1688, ignoring the fact that only four years previously
he had signed a twenty years’ truce with the Emperor, he resumed his war
against the Empire, and sent an army into the Palatinate. Leopold dis-
patched Charles and Max Emanuel to meet the attack upon the Rhine; the
advance against the Turks ceased; Turkish assault was renewed.</p>
<p>The new Sultan, Suleiman II, called to the vizierate another
Kuprili,</p>
<p>Mustafa, brother of Ahmed. Mustafa pacified the Christians in
European Turkey with extended freedom of worship, organized a new army,
and recaptured Belgrade (1690); but a year later he was killed, and the
Turks were routed, at Slankamen. Sultan Mustafa II took the lead of the
army in person, but was defeated at Senta (1697) by the Christians under
Prince Eugene of Savoy. Mustafa sued for peace; and Leopold, glad to be
freed for action against Louis, signed with Turkey, Poland, and Venice
the</p>
<p>Treaty of Karlowitz (1699). Turkey renounced all claims to
Transylvania and Hungary (except for the banat of Temesvar), ceded the
western Ukraine to Poland, and surrendered the Morea and northern
Dalmatia to Venice. It still retained nearly all the Balkans — southern
Dalmatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, and most of Greece; but
this treaty marked the end of the Turkish danger to Christendom.</p>
<p>What had caused the decline of the Ottoman power from its zenith</p>
<p>under Suleiman I? Nothing fails like success. The opportunities for
enjoy- ment that had come from victory and wealth proved too tempting;
the sul- tans dissipated in the harem the energy needed to discipline
the army, the bureaucracy, and the viziers. Their empire had grown too
large for effec- tive administration, for the rapid communication of
commands and trans- fer of soldiery; the provinces were ruled by pashas
whose distance from Constantinople made them almost independent of the
sultans. No longer stimulated by hunger or threatened by enemies, the
Turks slacked down into laziness and venality; bribery corrupted the
government while debase- ment of the currency disordered the economy and
the army. The Janis- saries, paid in depreciated coinage, repeatedly
rebelled; they discovered their power, and abused it in the measure of
its increase. They won the</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>right to marry, and obtained for their sons and others admission into
their once select corps; they repudiated the strict training and
discipline that had made the Janissaries the best soldiers in Europe.
Their leaders, become experts in venery, failed to keep abreast of
military science and weaponry. While the Christian West made better
guns, and developed superior strat- egy and tactics, in the life-and-
death struggle of the Thirty Years’ War, the Turks, who under Mohammed
II had had the best artillery in the world, found themselves, as at
Lepanto, inferior in fire power and strategy. War, which had
strengthened the Ottoman state when the sultans led their armies in
person, exhausted the state when they preferred the easy triumphs of the
harem to the ordeal of battle. Domination of life and thought by a
fatalistic and unprogressive religion stifled Islamic science, which in
the Middle Ages had been pre-eminent; knowledge grew in the West and
lagged in the East. The Christians improved their shipbuilding as well
as their gunnery. Their commerce advanced to all the continents, plowing
new roads through the sea, while most Ottoman commerce crawled in
caravans over the land. Lazy administrators allowed aqueducts and canals
to decay, while a peasantry disordered by war waited humbly for rain.
Westward the course of empire took its way, until one day, still moving
westward, it would find itself again in the East.</p>
<p>For the West the repulse of the Turks was an invitation to
internecine war. Freed from the pressure of Islam, Austria and Germany
turned to face the ambitions of Louis XIV, who was stretching his arms
into the Nether- lands, the Rhineland, the Palatinate, Italy, and Spain.
These blows from the West completed the disintegration of the Holy Roman
Empire; nothing remained of it but the form. The emperor came to think
of himself not as Roman but as Austrian; the Austro-Hungarian Empire
replaced the Holy Roman. The three thrones of Austria, Hungary, and
Bohemia were made hereditary in the Hapsburg family (1713), annulling
the traditional rights of the Bohemian and Hungarian Estates to elect
their kings. Hungary re- volted again (1 703-11) under Francis Rakoczy
II, but the revolt was sup- pressed, leaving the longing for freedom to
echo in poetry and song.</p>
<p>Austria manipulated the economies of Hungary and Bohemia to her own
advantage, and her upper classes enjoyed a new affluence. Splendid
palaces rose for the aristocracy; beautiful churches and monumental
monasteries housed the triumphant priests and monks. Prince Pal
Esterhazy rebuilt his great castle at Eisenstadt, where Haydn would
someday conduct and com- pose. In Vienna Domenico Martinelli designed
the Liechtenstein Palace and, for Eugene of Savoy, the Belvedere Palace;
Johann Fischer von Erlach raised for the same prince a sumptuous Winter
Palace, and laid the plans for the Royal Library, and the Imperial
Palace of Schonbrunn. In 1715</p>

<p>THE CHANGING EMPIRE</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>this greatest of Austrian architects began work on the Karlskirche at
Vienna, in the style of St. Peter’s at Rome. On the banks of the Danube
some forty miles west of Vienna, Jakob Prandtauer built the vast Kloster
Melk, the largest and most impressive Benedictine abbey in German lands;
this is the zenith of Austrian baroque. In the aftermath of victory the
able and lordly Archbishop Johann Ernst Thun laid out the famous
Mirabell Garden of Salzburg, with sculptures by Fischer von Erlach.
Proud and splendid, Austria moved into its greatest century.</p>
