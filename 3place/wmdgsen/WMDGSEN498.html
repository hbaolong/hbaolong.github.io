<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>XThe Unification of Russia</p>
<p>1300-1584</p>
<p>I. THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>I N 1300 Russia did not exist. The north belonged for the most part
to three self-governed city-states: Novgorod, Viatka, Pskov. The
west-</p>
<p>ern and southern provinces were dependencies of Lithuania. In the
east the principalities of Moscow, Ryazan, Suzday, Nijni Novgorod, and
Tver all claimed individual sovereignty, and were united only in common
subjection to the Golden Horde.</p>
<p>The Horde took its noun from Turkish ordu, camp, and its
adjective</p>
<p>from the domed tent, covered with cloth of gold, that had served as
head- quarters for Batu the Splendid, grandson of Ghengis Khan. Having
con- quered southern Russia and western Asia, these marauding Asiatics
built their capital at Sarai on a branch of the lower Volga, and there
received an- nual tribute from the Russian princes. The Horde was partly
agricultural, partly nomad pastoral. The ruling families were Mongol,
the rest were mostly Turks. The name Tatar came to the Horde from the
Ta-ta tribes of the Gobi, who in the ninth century had started the
Mongol avalanche to- ward the West. The chief results from the long
subjection of Russia to the Horde were social: the autocracy of the
Moscow dukes, the servile loyalty of the people to their princes, the
low status of woman, the military, finan- cial, and judicial
organization of the Muscovite government on Tatar lines. The Tatar
domination deferred for two centuries the attempt of Russia to become a
European Occidental state.</p>
<p>The Russian people faced the most arduous conditions with silent
stoicism, except that amid their tribulations they found the courage to
sing. Their enemies called them coarse, cruel, dishonest, cunning, and
violent; 1 doubt- less toil and trouble and a trying climate toughened
them; but their patience, good humor, friendliness, and hospitality
redeemed them — so much so that they were inclined to believe
themselves, more humano, the salt of the earth. They were beaten into
civilization by barbarous laws and frightful penalties; so, we are told,
a wife who murdered her husband was buried alive up to the neck,
sorcerers were burned alive in an iron cage, and counterfeiters had
liquid metal poured down their throats. 2 Like any people fighting cold,
the</p>
<p>647</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>XRussians drank alcohol abundantly, sometimes to drunken stupor; even
their food was seasoned to warm them. They enjoyed hot baths, and bathed
more frequently than most Europeans. Religion bade women hide their
tempting forms and hair, and branded them as Satan’s chosen instrument;
yet they were equal with men before the law, and often joined in public
pastimes or the dance — which was forbidden as a sin. The Russian Church
preached a strict morality, and prohibited conjugal relations during
Lent; presumably the severity of the code was a counterpoise to the
tendency of the people to indulge excessively in almost the only
pleasure left to them. Marriages were arranged by the parents, and came
early; girls of twelve, boys of fourteen, were considered nubile.
Wedding ceremonies were com- plex, with ancient symbolism and
festivities; through all these the bride was required to keep a modest
silence; her revenge was deferred. On the morrow she was expected to
show to h er husband’s mother the evidence that he had married a virgin.
Usually the women of the household remained in an upper apartment or
terern, away from the men; and the authority of the father was as
absolute in the family as that of the czar in the state.</p>
<p>Piety sublimated poverty into a preparation for paradise. Every house
of any size had a room decorated with icons as a place of frequent
prayer. A proper visitor, before saluting his hosts, saluted the icons
first. Good women carried rosaries wherever they went. Prayers were
recited as magic incan- tations; so, said the Domostroi — a famous
manual of the sixteenth century — a certain prayer repeated 6 00 times a
day for three years would cause the incarnation, in the re-petitioner,
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. 3 But there were many
beautiful features in this superstitious religion. On Easter morning
people greeted one another with the joyful words, “Christ is risen.” In
this hope death was in some measure eased; facing it, a decent</p>
<p>The Russian Church stimulated this piety with architecture, murals,
icons, powerful sermons, hypnotic ceremonies, and massive choral song
that seemed to rise from the most mystical depths of the soul or the
stomach. The Church was a vital organ of the state, and her services in
teaching letters and morality, disciplining character, and buttressing
social order were lavishly rewarded. Monasteries were numerous and
immense. The Troitsa-Sergie- vskaya Lavra — the Monastery of the Trinity
founded by St. Sergius in 1335 — had amassed by 1600 such extensive
lands that over 100,000 peasants were needed for their cultivation. In
return the monasteries distributed charity on a Russian scale; some fed
400 people daily; in a famine year the monastery at Volokolamsk fed
7,000 in one day. Monks took a vow of chastity, but priests were obliged
to marry. These “papas” were mostlv illiterate, but</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) THE UNIFICATION OF RUSSIA 649</p>
<p>that was not held against them by the people. The metropolitans of
Moscow were in many cases the ablest, as well as the most learned, men
of their gener- ation, risking their silver to preserve the state, and
guiding the princes toward national unity. St. Alexis was the virtual
ruler of Russia during his tenure of the Muscovite see (1354-70). With
all her faults — which may have been dictated by her tasks — the Russian
Church in this formative age served as the supreme civilizing agent
among a people brutalized by the hardships of life and the predatory
nature of man.</p>
<p>In 1448 the Russian Church, repudiating the merger of Greek with Ro-
man Christianity at the Council of Florence, declared her independence
of the Byzantine patriarch; and when, five years later, Constantinople
fell to the Turks, Moscow became the metropolis of the Orthodox faith.
“Know now,” wrote a f ervent monk to a Grand Prince of Moscow about
1505, “that the sovereignty of all Christendom has been united in thine
own. For the two Romes have fallen, but the third doth endure. A fourth
there shall never be, for thy Christian empire shall last forever.”
4</p>
<p>The Church was almost the sole patron of letters and the arts, and
there- fore their dictator. The best literature was unwritten. The songs
of the peo- ple, passing from mouth to mouth, from generation to
generation, celebrated their loves, weddings, sorrows, seasons,
holydays, or deaths; and there were popular lays of cherished saints,
ancient heroes, and legendary exploits, like those of Sadko the merchant
of Novgorod. Blind men or cripples went from village to village singing
such songs and lays and sacred chants. Written literature was nearly all
monastic, and served religion.</p>
<p>It was the monks who now brought icon painting to a finished art.
Upon a small panel of wood, sometimes covered with cloth, they applied a
gluti- nous coat; on this they drew their design; within this they laid
their colors in tempera; they covered the painting with varnish, and
enclosed it in a metal frame. The subjects were determined by
ecclesiastical authority; the figures and features were derived from
Byzantine models, and went back in continuous evolution through the
mosaics of Constantinople to the paint- ings of Hellenistic Alexandria.
The best icons from this age are the anony- mous Christ Enthroned in the
Cathedral of the Assumption in Moscow; the Entry of Christ into
Jerusalem, from the school of Novgorod; and The Holy Trinity of the monk
Andrei Rubliov in the Monastery of the Trinity. Rubliov and his teacher,
Theophanes the Greek, painted frescoes, half By- zantine and half
Byzantine El Greco, in Vladimir, Moscow, and Novgorod, but time has had
its way with them.</p>
<p>Every ruler signalized his splendor, and eased his conscience, by
building or endowing a church or a monastery. Forms and motives from
Armenia, Persia, India, Tibet, Mongolia, Italy, and Scandinavia joined
with the pre- dominant Byzantine heritage to mold Russian church
architecture, with its</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>650</p>
<p>(chap, xxa</p>
<p>picturesque multiplicity of units, its central gilded dome, its
bulbous cupolas admirably designed to shed rain and snow. After the fall
of Constantinople and the expulsion of the Tatars the dependence of
Russia upon Byzantine and Oriental art subsided, and influences from the
West entered to modify the Slavic style. In 1472 Ivan III, hoping
thereby to inherit the rights and titles of the Byzantine emperors,
married Zoe Palaeologus, niece of the last ruler of the Eastern Empire.
She had been brought up in Rome, and had imbibed something of the early
Renaissance. She brought Greek scholars with her, and acquainted Ivan
with Italian art. It may have been at her sug- gestion that he sent the
first Russian mission to the West (1474), with instructions to secure
Italian artists for Moscow. Ridolfo Fieravante of Bo- logna, called
Aristotle because of the range of his abilities, accepted the
invitation; and further Russian forays netted Pietro Solario, Alevisio
Novi, and several other artists. It was these Italians who, with Russian
aides and labor, rebuilt the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Yuri Dolgoruki had founded Moscow (1156) by raising a wall around his
villa, which was strategically situated at the confluence of two rivers;
this fortress ( kreml ) was the first form of the Kremlin. In time the
enclosure was enlarged, and churches and palaces rose within a massive
wall of oak. Ivan III set himself to transform the entire ensemble. It
was apparently Fieravante who (1475-79) reconstructed, in the Kremlin,
the old Cathedral of the Assumption (Uspenskiy Sobor), where future
czars were to be crowned; the design remained Byzantine, with Italian
decoration. Architects from Pskov added, in the enclosure, the little
Cathedral of the Annunciation (Blagovyeschenskiy Sobor, 1484-89); and,
again in the Kremlin, Alevisio raised the Cathedral of the Archangel
(1505-09). Solario and others re- walled the circuit in pink brick
(1485-1508), in the style of the Castello Sforzesco at Milan. 8 It was
from this many-templed center of Russia, this overpowering union and
concentration of secular and ecclesiastical author- ity, that the grand
princes and the metropolitans of Moscow spread their rale over nobles,
merchants, and peasants, and laid in blood and bones and piety the
foundations of one of the mightiest empires in history.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE PRINCES OF MOSCOW</li>
</ol>
<p>Moscow remained an obscure village until Daniel Alexandrovitch,
toward the end of the thirteenth century, extended its hinterland and
made it a minor principality. Historical hindsight 8 attributes Moscow’s
growth to its position on the navigable Moscow River, which was
connected by short overland portage with the Volga on the east and the
Oka, Don, and Dnieper on the south and west. Yuri Danielovitch — son of
Daniel — Prince of Mos-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIX) THE UNIFICATION OF RUSSIA 6 $ I</p>
<p>cow, coveted the neighboring principality of Suzdal, with its
relatively rich capital, Vladimir; Michael, Prince of Tver, coveted the
same; Moscow and Tver fought for the prize; Moscow won; Michael was
killed and canon- ized; Moscow grew. Yuri’s brother and successor, Ivan
I, took the double title of Grand Prince of Moscow and Grand Duke of
Vladimir.</p>
<p>As collector of Russian tribute for the Tatar khan, Ivan I exacted
more than he remitted, and prospered wickedly. His rapacity won him the
nick- name Kalita, Moneybag, but he gave the principalities thirteen
years’ respite from Tatar raids. He died as a tonsured monk, censered
with the odor of sanctity (1341). His son Simeon the Proud inherited his
flair for taxgather- ing. Claiming authority over every province, he
called himself Grand Prince of All the Russias, which did not prevent
his dying of the plague (1353). Ivan II was a gentle and peaceable
ruler, under whom Russia fell into fratri- cidal war. His son Dmitri had
all requisite martial qualities; he defeated every rival, and defied the
khan. In 1 380 Khan Mamai assembled a horde of Tatars, Genoese
mercenaries, and other flotsam, and advanced toward Moscow. Dmitri and
his Russian allies met the horde at Kulikovo, near the Don, de- feated
it (1380), and won the cognomen Donskoi. Two years later the Tatars
attacked again, with 100,000 men. The Russians, deceived and ex- hausted
by victory, failed to raise a comparable force; the Tatars captured
Moscow, massacred 24,000 of the population, and burned the city to the
ground. Dmitri’s son Vasili I made peace with the Tatars, annexed Nijni
Novgorod, and compelled Novgorod and Viatka to accept him as their
overlord.</p>
<p>The Grand Princes of Moscow adopted the Tatar technique of despotism,
perhaps as the alternative to an illiterate chaos. Under an autocracy of
vio- lence and craft a bureaucracy on Byzantine lines administered the
govern- ment, subject to a Council of Boyars advising and serving the
prince. The boyars were at once the leaders of the army, the governing
lords of their localities, the organizers, protectors, and exploiters of
the semifree peasants who tilled the land. Adventurous colonists
migrated to unsettled regions, drained the swamps, fertilized the soil
by burning the woods and brush, exhausted it with improvident tillage,
and moved on again, until they reached the White Sea and the Urals, and
seeped into Siberia. In the endless plains towns were many but small;
houses were of wood and mud, calcu- lated to burn down within twenty
years at most. Roads were unpaved, and were least agonizing in winter,
when they were covered with snow packed by sleds and patient boots.
Merchants preferred rivers to roads, and by water or ice carried on a
plodding trade between north and south, with Byzantium, Islam, and the
Hanse. Probably it was this spreading commerce that overcame the
individualism of the princes and compelled the unifica- tion of Russia.
Vasili II ( 1425-62), called Temny, the Blind, because his</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>652</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xfoes gouged out his eyes (1446), brought all rebels to obedience
with tor- ture, mutilation, and the knout, and left to his son a Russia
sufficiently strong to end the ignominy of Tatar rule.</p>
<p>Ivan III became “the Great” because he accomplished this tas k, and
made Russia one. He was built to need: unscrupulous, subtle,
calculating, tena- cious, cruel, guiding his armies to distant victories
from his seat in the Krem- lin; punishing disobedience or incompetence
savagely, whipping, torturing, mutilating even the boyars, beheading a
doctor for failing to cure his son, and so sternly dominating his
entourage that women fainted at his glance. Russia called him the
Terrible until it met his grandson.</p>
<p>The easiest of his conquests was Novgorod. He looked with hungry an-
ticipation upon that thriving taxable mart, and the merchants of Moscow
urged him to destroy their competitors in the north. 7 The Grand Prince
controlled the plains between Moscow and Novgorod; there the mercantile
republic bought its food and sold its goods; Ivan had only to close that
gran- ary and market to Novgorod’s trade, and the city -state must go
bankrupt or yield. After eight years of alternating war and truce, the
republic sur- rendered its autonomy (1478). Seven thousand of its
leading inhabitants were transplanted to Suzdal, the Hanse was expelled,
the merchants of Moscow inherited the markets, their Prince the
revenues, of Novgorod.</p>
<p>Absorbing the colonies of the dead republic, Ivan extended his rule
to Finland, the Arctic, and the Urals. Pskov submitted in time to
preserve its republican forms under the sovereignty of the Grand Prince.
Tver sought preservation by allying itself with Lithuania; Ivan marched
in person against the city, and took it without a blow. Rostov and
Iaroslavl followed. When Ivan’s brothers died he refused to let their
appanages descend to their heirs; he added their territories to his own.
One brother, Andrei, flirted with Lith- uania; Ivan captured and
imprisoned him; Andrei died in jail; Ivan wept, but confiscated Andrei’s
lands. La politique n’a pas d’entrailles.</p>
<p>Liberation from the Tatars seemed impossible and proved easy. The
rem- nants of the Mongol-Turkish invaders had settled down in three
rival groups centering at Sarai, Kazan, and in the Crimea. Ivan played
one against another until he was assured that they would not unite
against him. In 1480 he re- fused tribute. Khan Akhmet led a great army
up the Volga to the banks of the Oka and Ugra south of Moscow; Ivan led
150,000 men to the opposite banks. For months the hostile hosts faced
each other without giving battle; Ivan hesitated to risk his throne and
life on one throw, the Tatars feared his improved artillery. When the
rivers froze and no longer protected the armies from each other, Ivan
ordered a retreat. Instead of pursuing, the Tatars too retreated, all
the way to Sarai (1480). It was an immense and ridiculous victory. From
that time no tribute was paid by Moscow to the Horde; the Grand Prince
called himself autocrat (Samoderzhets) . meaning</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX ) THE UNIFICATION OF RUSSIA 653</p>
<p>that he paid tribute to none. The rival khans were maneuvered into
mutual war; Akhmet was defeated and slain; the Golden Horde of Sarai
melted away.</p>
<p>Lithuania remained. Neither the Grand Prince nor the metropolitan of
Moscow could suffer peace so long as the Ukraine and Kiev and western
Russia were under a power perpetually threatening Moscow, and inviting
Orthodox Christians into Latin Christianity. An alleged Polish plot to
assassi- nate Ivan gave him a casus belli and let loose a holy war for
the redemption of the seduced provinces (1492). Many Lithuanian princes,
uneasy under the Polish-Roman- Catholic union, opened their gates to
Ivan’s troops . Alex- ander, Great Prince of Lithuania, made a stand at
Vedrosha, and lost ( 1 500) . Pope Alexander VI arranged a six-year
truce; meanwhile Moscow kept the region it had won — west to the river
Sozh, including Chernigov and reach- ing almost to Smolensk. Ivan III,
now sixty-three, left the redemption of the remainder to his heirs.</p>
<p>His reign of forty-three years was as important as any in the history
of Russia before the twentieth century. Whether inspired by lust for
wealth and power, or by a conviction that the security and prosperity of
the Rus- sians required the unification of Russia, Ivan III achieved for
his country what Louis XI was doing for France, Henry VII for England,
Ferdinand and Isabella for Spain, Alexander VI for the Papal States; the
simultaneity of these events revealed the progress of nationalism and
monarchy, dooming the supemational power of the papacy. The boyars lost
their independ- ence, the principalities sent tribute to Moscow, Ivan
took the title “Sover - eign of All the Russias.” Possibly at the behest
of his Greek wife he assumed also the Roman-Greek title of czar (Caesar)
, adopted the Imperial double eagle as the national emblem, and claimed
inheritance to all the political and religious authority of defunct
Byzantium. Byzantine theories and cere- monies of government, and of the
Church as an organ of the state, followed Byzantine Christianity, the
Byzantine Greek alphabet, and Byzantine art forms, into Russia; and so
far as Byzantium had been Orientalized by its proximity to Asia, so
Russia, already oriented by Tatar rule, became in many ways an Oriental
monarchy, alien and unintelligible to the West.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>IVAN THE TERRIBLE: 1 53 3-84</li>
</ol>
<p>Vasili III Ivanovitch (1505-33) continued the integration of Russia.
He brought Smolensk within his realm, and compelled the principalities
of Ryazan and Novgorod- Severski to acknowledge his sovereignty. “Only
the infants at the breast,” said a Russian annalist, “could refrain from
tears” when the once proud republic of Pskov submitted to Vasili’s rule
(1510).</p>
<p>654 THE reformation (chap. xxix</p>
<p>Russia was now a major European power; Vasili corresponded on equal
terms with Maximilian I, Charles V, Suleiman the Magnificent, and Leo X.
When some boyars tried to limit his autocracy he checked them with a
con- temptuous word — “Peasants! and had one noble head cut off. Getting
no children from his wife, he divorced her and married the accomplished
and masterful Helena Glinski. After his death she took the regency for
her three-year-old son Ivan IV Vasilievitch. The boyars resumed their
turbu- lence when she died; their rival factions controlled the
government in turn; they disordered the cities with their violence, and
spilled the blood of their helpless muzhiks in civil war.</p>
<p>Amid these struggles the young Sovereign of All the Russias was
almost ignored, even at times left destitute. Seeing brutality
everywhere around him, he took it as an accepted mode of behavior,
adopted the most cruel sports, and grew into a moody and suspicious
youth. Suddenly, while still a boy of thirteen (1544), he threw to his
dogs Andrei Shuiski, leader of a boyar faction, and seized command of
the state. Three years later he had himself crowned czar by the
metropolitan of Moscow. Then he ordered a selection of noble virgins to
be sent to him from divers parts of his realm; from them he chose and
married Anastasia Romanovna, whose family name would soon designate a
dynasty.</p>
<p>In 1550 he summoned the first national assembly (Zemski Sobor) of all
Russia. He confessed to it the errors of his youth, and promised a just
and merciful government. Perhaps influenced by the Reformation in
Germany and Scandinavia, the assembly considered a motion to confiscate
ecclesiastical wealth for the support of the state. The proposal was
rejected, but a related motion was passed by which all alodial lands —
those free from liens — deeded to the Church were to be restored, all
gifts made to the Church during Ivan’s minority were canceled, and
monasteries were no longer to acquire certain kinds of property without
the czar’s consent. The clergy were partly ap - peased when Ivan took
the priest Sylvester as his spiritual director and made him and Alexis
Adashef his chief ministers. Supported by these able aides, Ivan at
twenty-one was master of a realm reaching from Smolensk to the Urals,
and from the Arctic Ocean almost to the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>His first care was to strengthen the army, and to balance the forces
pro- vided by the unfriendly nobles with two organizations responsible
directly to himself: Cossack cavalry and Strieltsi infantry armed with
harquebuses — matchlock firearms invented in the fifteenth century.* The
Cossacks orig- inated in that century as peasants whose position in
South Russia, between Moslems and Muscovites, obliged them to be ready
to fight at short notice, but gave them irresistible opportunities to
rob the caravans that carried trade</p>

<p>between north and south. The main Cossack “hosts”— the Don Cossacks
in southeast Russia and the Zaporogue Cossacks in the southwest — were
semi- independent republics, strangely democratic; male householders
chose a hetman (German Hauptmann, head man) as executive officer of a
popularly elected assembly. All land was owned in common, but was leased
to individ- ual families for temporary use; and all classes were equal
before the law. 8 Famous for their dashing courage, the Cossack horsemen
became the main support of Ivan IV at home and in war.</p>
<p>His foreign policy was simple: he wanted Russia to connect the Baltic
Sea with the Caspian. The Tatars still held Kazan, Astrakhan, and the
Crimea, and still demanded tribute from Moscow, though in vain. Ivan was
sure that Russia’s security and unity required its possession of these
khanates, and control of the Volga to its outlet. In 1552 the young Czar
led 150,000 men against the gates of Kazan in a siege that lasted fifty
days. The 30,000 Moslems resisted with religious pertinacity; they
sallied out in repeated sorties; and when some of them were captured and
hanged on gibbets before the walls, the defenders shot them with arrows,
saying that “it was better for these captives to receive death from the
clean hands of their countrymen than to perish by the impure hands of
Christians.” 9 When the besiegers lost heart after a month of failure,
Ivan sent to Moscow for a miraculous cross; this, displayed to them,
reanimated his men; on both sides God was con- scripted into military
service. A German engineer mined the walls; they collapsed; the Russians
poured into the city, crying “God with us!”— and massacred all who could
not be sold as slaves. Ivan, we are told, wept with pity for the
defeated; “they are not Christians,” he said, “but they are men.” He
repeopled the ruins with Christians. Russia acclaimed him as the first
Slav to take a Tatar stronghold, and celebrated the victory as France
had hailed the check of the Moslems at Tours (732). In 1554 Ivan took
As- trakhan, and the Volga became a completely Russian stream. The
Crimea remained Moslem till 1774, but the Cossacks of the Don now bowed
to Moscow’s rule.</p>
<p>Having cleared his frontier in the east, Ivan looked longingly toward
the west. He dreamed of Russian commerce flowing west and north along
great rivers into the Baltic. He envied the industrial and commercial
expansion of Western Europe, and looked for any opening by which the
Russian economy might attach itself to that development. In 1553 Sir
Hugh Will- oughby and Richard Chancellor were commissioned by London
merchants to find an Arctic route around Scandinavia to China. They
sailed from Harwich in three vessels; two crews perished in a Lapland
winter, but Chancellor reached the site of Arkhangelsk — which the
British so named after the archangel Michael. Chancellor made his way
through a hundred perils and hardships to Moscow. With him, and later
with Anthony Jenkin-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xson, Ivan signed treaties giving “The London and Muscovite Company”
special trading privileges in Russia.</p>
<p>But to Ivan these treaties were knotholes, not a door or window, into
the West. He tried to import German technicians; 123 were gathered for
him at Liibeck, but Charles V refused to let them go. A great river, the
Southern Dvina, flowed from the heart of Russia into the Baltic near
Riga, but through hostile Livonia. The headwaters of the Dvina and the
Volga were not far apart; the two rive rs could be connected by canals;
here, by “manifest des - tiny,” was the water route that might atone for
the disproportion of Russia’s enormous land mass to her coasts and
ports; so the Baltic would mingle with the Caspian and the Black Sea,
East and West would meet, and amid the interchange of goods and ideas
the West could repay some of its ancient cultural debt to the East.</p>
<p>So in 1557 Ivan invented a casus belli — usually a case of the belly
— with Livonia. He sent against it an army under Shah-Ali, lately Tatar
Khan of Kazan; it ravaged the country brutally, burning houses and
crops, enslaving men, raping women till they died. In 1558 another
Russian army captured Narva, only eight miles from the Baltic. Desperate
Livonia appealed to Poland. Denmark, Sweden, Germany, all Central Europe
trembled at the prospect of a Slav inundation reaching westward, as in
the sixth century, to the Elbe. Stephen Bathory roused the Poles, and
led them to victory over the Russians at Polotsk (1582). Ivan, defeated,
yielded Livonia to Poland.</p>
<p>Long before this decisive setback the failure of his campaigns had
led to revolt at home. The merchants whom Ivan had thought to enrich
with new avenues of trade lost stomach for the costly and disruptive
war. The nobles had opposed it as bound to unite the Baltic powers, with
their superior armament, against a Russia still feudal in political and
military organization. During and before the war Ivan had suspected the
boyars of conspiracies against his throne. In a nearly fatal illness
(1553) he learned that a powerful group of nobles was planning, when he
died, to repudiate his son Dmitri and crown Prince Vladimir, whose
mother was disbursing large gifts to the army. His closest advisers,
Sylvester and Adashef, were flirting with treasonable boyars. For seven
years after suspecting them Ivan kept these officials in power; then ( 1
560) he dismissed them, but without violence; Sylvester died in a
monastery, Adashef in one of the Livonian campaigns. Several of the
boyars deserted to Poland and took up arms against Russia; in 1564
Ivan’s bosom friend and leading general, Prince Andrei Kurbski, joined
this flight, alleging that the Czar was planning to kill him. From
Poland Kurbski sent to Ivan what amounted to a declaration of war,
denouncing him as a leprous criminal. Tradition claims that Ivan, when
this letter was read to him, nailed a foot of the bearer to the floor
with a blow of the royal staff. But the Czar condescended to reply to
Kurbski in a rebuttal sixty-two pages long, elo-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX ) THE UNIFICATION OF RUSSIA 65 J</p>
<p>quent and chaotic, passionate and Biblical, recounting the intrigues
of the boyars to depose him. Believing that they had poisoned Anastasia,
he asked, “Why did you divide me from my wife? Had you not taken from me
my young heifer, never had there been the slayings of the boyars. … In
vain I have looked for some man to have p ity on me, but I have found
none.” 10 Kurbski, in the evening of his life, wrote a relentlessly
hostile History of Ivan , which is our chief source for Ivan’s
terribilitct.</p>
<p>These plots and desertions illuminate the most famous and peculiar
event of the reign. On December 13, 1564, Ivan left Moscow with his
family, his icons, his treasury, and a small force of soldiery, withdrew
to his summer home at Alexandrovsk, and sent to Moscow two
proclamations. One al- leged that the boyars, the bureaucracy, and the
Church had conspired against him and the state; therefore “with great
sorrow” he now resigned his throne, and would henceforth live in
retirement. The other assured the people of Moscow that he loved them,
and that they might rest assured of his lasting good will. In fact he
had consistently favored the commons and merchants against the
aristocracy, and the present action of the middle and lower classes
attested it. They broke out in threatening cries against the nobility
and the clergy, and demanded that a deputation of bishops and boyars
should go to the Czar and beg him to resume his throne. It was done, and
Ivan agreed’ to “take unto him his state anew,” on conditions that he
would later specify.</p>
<p>He returned to Moscow (February 1565), and summoned the national
assembly of clergy and boyars. He announced that he would execute the
leaders of the opposition, and confiscate their property; he would
henceforth assume full power, without consulting the nobles or assembly,
and he would banish all who should disobey his edicts. The assembly,
fearing a revolt of the masses, yielded and dissolved. Ivan decreed that
in the future Russia should be divided into two parts: one, the
Zemstchina or assemblage of provinces, was to remain under the
government of the boyars and their duma; it was to be taxable in gross
by the Czar, and be subject to him in military and foreign affairs, but
would otherwise be self -governed and free; the other part, the
Oprichnina , or “separate estate,” was to be ruled by him, and was to be
composed of lands assigned by him to the oprichniki or sep- arate class,
chosen by the Czar to police and administer this half-realm, to guard it
from sedition, and to give him personal protection and special mili-
tary service. The new officials — at first a thousand, ultimately six
thousand — were selected chiefly from the younger sons of the nobility,
who, being landless, were ready to support Ivan in return for the
estates now conferred upon them. These lands were taken partly from the
possessions of the Crown, largely from the confiscated properties of
rebellious boyars. By the end of the reign the Oprichnina included
nearly half of Russia, much of Moscow, and the most important trade
routes. The revolution was akin to that which</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>658</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>XPeter the Great attempted 1 50 years later — the elevation of a new
class to political power, and the promotion of Russian commerce and
industry. In a century when practically all the military power was held
by the aristocracy, the enterprise required a wild courage in a Czar
armed only with his personal soldiery and the unreliable support of the
merchants and the populace. Some contemporaries assure us that in this
critical period Ivan, then thirty-five, aged twenty years. 11</p>
<p>Ivan now made Alexandrovsk his regular residence, and transformed it
into a fortified citadel. The strain of his revolt against the boyars,
added to the failure of the long war against Livonia, may have
disordered a never quite balanced mind. He clothed his guardsmen like
monks in black cassocks and skull caps, called himself their abbot, sang
in their choir, attended Mass with them daily, and so fervently
prostrated himself before the altar that his forehead was repeatedly
bruised. This added to the awe that he inspired; Russia began to mingle
reverence with the fear it felt for him; and even the armed oprichniki
were so abject before him that they came to be called his dvor or
court.</p>
<p>Ivan’s revolution, like others, had its terror. Those who opposed it
and were caught were executed without mercy. A monastic chronicle,
presum- ably hostile to him, reckoned the casualties of his wrath in
those years (1560- 70) at 3,470; often, it reports, the victim was
executed “with his wife,” or “with his wife and children,” and, in one
case, “with ten men who came to his help.” 12 Prince Vladimir and his mo
ther were put to death, but his children were spared and provided for.
The Czar, we are told, asked the monks to pray for the repose of his
victims’ souls. He defended the executions as the usual punishment for
treason, especially in time of war; an agent of Poland conceded the
argument; and an Englishman who witnessed some of the butchery prayed,
“Would to God our own stiff -necked rebels could be taught their duty to
their prince after the same fashion!” 18</p>
<p>The climax of the terror came in Novgorod. Ivan had recently given
its archbishop a large sum to repair churches, and thought himself
popular with at least the clergy there. But he was informed that a
document — not in- disputably genuine — had been found behind a picture
of the Virgin in a Novgorod monastery, pledging the co-operation of
Novgorod and Pskov with Poland in an attempt to overthrow the Czar. On
January 2, 1570, a strong military force led by oprichniki pounced upon
Novgorod, sacked its monasteries, and arrested 500 monks and priests.
Arriving in person on January 6, Ivan ordered those clerics who could
not pay fifty rubles’ ransom to be flogged to death. The archbishop was
unfrocked and jailed. According to the Third Chronicle of Novgorod a
massacre of the population ensued for five weeks; sometimes 500 persons
were slain in a day; the official records number 2,770 dead; Ivan
orotested they were only 1,50?. Since many mer-</p>

<p>chants, eager for the reopening of trade with the West, were believed
to have shared in the conspiracy, the soldiers of the Czar burned all
the shops in the city, and the homes of the merchants in the suburbs;
even the farmhouses in the environs were destroyed. Unless unfriendly
monastic chroniclers have exaggerated the carnage, we must go back to
the punishment of re- bellious Liege by Charles the Bold (1468), or the
Sack of Rome by the troops of Charles V (1527) to find analogies for
Ivan’s savage r evenge. Novgorod never recovered its old prominence in
the commercial life of Russia. Ivan passed on to Pskov, where he
restricted his soldiers to pillage. Then he returned to Moscow and
celebrated with a royal masquerade ball his escape from a dangerous
conspiracy.</p>
<p>So turbulent a reign hardly favored economic progress or cultural
pur- suits. Commerce was favored in peace and wounded in war. In the
lands allotted to the oprichniki, and then on other lands as well, the
peasant was legally attached to the soil as a means of promoting
continuous culti- vation (1581 ) ; serfdom, rare in Russia before 1500,
became by 1600 the law of the land. Taxation was predatory, inflation
was precipitous. The ruble in 1500 was worth ninety-four, in 1600
twenty-four, times the ruble of 1910; 14 we need not follow the decline
further, except to note, as one of the lessons of history, that money is
the last thing that a man should save.</p>
<p>The improvident fertility of families and exhaustion of soils
compelled a restless migration to fresh terrain. When this passed the
Urals it found a Tatar khanate established over a population of Bashkirs
and Ostyaks, around a capital known by the Cossack word Sibir. In 1581
Semen Stroganov en- listed 600 Cossacks and sent them under Ermak
Timofeevitch to conquer these tribes. It was done; western Siberia
became part of the swelling Rus- sian realm; and Ermak, who had been a
brigand chief, was canonized by the Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>The Church remained the real ruler of Russia, for the fear of God was
everywhere, while Ivan’s reach was limited. Strict rules of ritual, if
not of</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xbegan to list Ivan’s crimes and debaucheries. “Hold thy peace,”
cried the Czar, “and give me thy blessing!” “My silence,” answered the
prelate, “lays a sin upon thy soul, and calls down thy death.” Ivan
departed unblessed, and for a wondering month Philip remained unhurt.
Then a servitor of the Czar entered the cathedral, seized the
Metropolitan, and dragged him to a prison in Tver. His fate is debated;
the account accepted by the Russian Church is that he was burned alive.
In 1652 he was canonized, and his relics remained till 1917 an object of
reverence in the Uspenskiy Sobor.</p>
<p>The Church still produced most of the literature and art of Russia.
Print- ing arrived about 1491, but the only books printed during this
reign were manuals of prayer. The leading scholar was the metropolitan
Macarius; in 1529, aided by secretaries, he began to compile the
surviving literature of his country in twelve huge volumes, which again
were almost entirely reli- gious, mostly monkish, chronicles. Ivan’s
confessor Sylvester composed a famous Domostroi, or Household Book, as a
guide to domestic economy, manners, and eternal salvation; we note in it
the admonition to the husband to beat his wife lovingly, and precise
instructions for spitting and for blow- ing the nose. 10 Ivan himself,
in his letters, was not the least vigorous writer of his time.</p>
<p>The most brilliant product of Russian art under his rule was the
Church of Basil the Blessed (Khram Vasilia Blajennoi), which still
stands aloof from the Kremlin at one end of the Red Square. On returning
from his triumphant campaigns against Kazan and Astrakhan ( 1 554) Ivan
began what he called Pokrovski Sobor — the Cathedral of the Intercession
of the Virgin, to whom he judiciously ascribed his victories. Around
this central shrine of stone there later rose seven chapels in wood,
dedicated to saints on whose festivals Ivan had overcome his foes. Each
chapel was crowned with a graceful painted cupola, each bulbous but
varying from the others in ornament. The final chapel, raised to
St. Basil in 1588, gave its name in time to the whole charming ensemble.
Inevitable legend credited the architecture to an Italian, and told how
Ivan had gouged out his eyes lest he should ever rival this masterpiece;
but it was two Russians, Barma and Postnikov, who designed it, merely
adopting some Renaissance motives in its decoration. 17 Every year, on
Palm Sunday, as part of the wisdom of government, the lords and clergy
of Moscow walked in awesome procession to this cathedral; the
metropolitan rode sideways on a horse equipped with artificial ears to
simulate the ass on which Christ was described as entering Jerusalem;
and the Czar, on foot, humbly led the horse by the bridle; banners,
crosses, icons, and censers flourished, and children raised hosannas of
praise and gratitude to inclement skies for the blessings of Russian
life.</p>
<p>By 1580 Ivan seemed to have triumphed over all his enemies. He had
survived several wives, was married to a sixth, and thought of adding
an-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX ) THE UNIFICATION OF RUSSIA 66 1</p>
<p>other in friendly bigamy. 18 He had four children: the first died in
infancy, the third, Feodor, was a half-wit; the fourth, Dmitri, was
alleged to have epileptic fits. One day in November 1580, the Czar,
seeing the wife of his second son, Ivan, in what seemed to him immodest
attire, reproved and struck her; she miscarried; the Czarevitch
reproached his father; the Czar, in unpremeditated rage, struck him on
the head with the imperial staff; the son died from the blow. The Czar
went insane with remorse; he spent his days and nights crying aloud with
grief; each morning he offered his resig- nation; but even the boyars
now preferred him to his sons. He survived three years more. Then a
strange disease attacked him, which made his body swell and emit an
unbearable stench. On March 1 8, 1 584, he died while play- ing chess
with Boris Godunov. Gossip accused Boris of poisoning him, and the stage
was set for grand opera in the history of the czars.</p>
<p>We must not think of Ivan IV as merely an ogre of brutality. Tall and
strong, he would have been handsome but for a broad flat nose that over-
lay a spreading mustache and a heavy auburn beard. The appellation
Groznyi is mistranslated Terrible; it meant, rather, awesome, like the
Au- gustus that was applied to the Caesars; Ivan III had also received
the name. To our minds, and even to his cruel contemporaries, he was
repulsively cruel and vengeful, and he was a merciless judge. He lived
in the age of the Spanish Inquisition, the burning of Servetus, the
decapitating habits of Henry VIII, the Marian persecution, the Massacre
of St. Bartholomew; when he heard of this holocaust (which a pope
welcomed with praise) he denounced the barbarism of the West. 19 He had
some provocations, which set on fire a readily combustible temper made
violent by heredity or environment; some- time s, says a witness, a
small annoyance made him “foam at the mouth like a horse.” 20 He
confessed and at times exaggerated his sins and crimes, so that his
enemies could only plagiarize him in their accusations. He studied zeal-
ously, and made himself the best-educated layman of his land and time.
He had a sense of humor, and could roar with Jovian laughter, but a
sinister cunning showed often in his smile. He paved his hell with
wonderful in- tentions: he would protect the poor and the weak against
the rich and the strong; he would favor commerce and the middle classes
as checks on the feudal and quarrelsome aristocracy; he would open a
door of trade in goods and ideas to the West; he would give Russia a new
administrative class not bound, like the boyars, to ancient and stagnant
ways; he would free Russia from the Tatars, and raise her out of chaos
into unity. He was a barbarian barbarously struggling to be
civilized.</p>
<p>He failed because he never matured to self-mastery. The reforms that
he had planned were half forgotten in the excitement of revolution. He
left the peasants more bitterly subject to the landlords than before; he
clogged the avenues of trade with war; he drove able men into the arms
of the enemy;</p>
<p>662</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xhe divided Russia into hostile halves, and guided her into anarchy.
He gave his people a demoralizing example of pious cruelty and
uncontrolled passion. He killed his ablest son, and bequeathed his
throne to a weakling whose in- capacity invited civil war. He was one of
the many men of his time of whom it might be said that it would have
been better for their country and human- ity if they had never been
born.</p>
