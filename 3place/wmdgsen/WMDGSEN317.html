<p>The Transmission of Knowledge</p>
<p>1000-1300</p>
<p>I. THE RISE OF THE VERNACULARS</p>
<p>AS the Church had preserved in some measure that political unity of
west- l  ern Europe that the Roman Empire had achieved, so her ritual,
her ser- mons, and her schools maintained a Roman heritage now lost — an
interna- tional language intelligible to all the literate population of
Italy, Spain, France, England, Scandinavia, the Lowlands, Germany,
Poland, Hungary, and the western Balkans. Educated men in these
countries used Latin for correspondence, business records, diplomacy,
law, government, science, phi- losophy, and nearly all literature before
the thirteenth century. They spoke Latin as a living language, which
almost daily developed a new word or phrase to denote the new or
changing realities or ideas of their lives. They wrote their love
letters in Latin, from the simplest billets-doux to the classic epistles
of Helolse and Abelard. A book was written not for a nation but for the
continent; it needed no translation, and passed from country to country
with a speed and freedom unknown today. Students went from one univer-
sity to another with no thought of linguistic embarrassments; scholars
could lecture in the same language at Bologna, Salamanca, Paris, Oxford,
Uppsala, and Cologne. They did not hesitate to import new words into
Latin, some- times to the horror of the Petrarcan-Ciceronian ear; so
Magna Carta ruled that no freeman should be dissaisiatus or
imprisonatus. Such words make us wince, but they kept Latin alive. Many
modem English terms — for instance instance, substantive, essence,
entity — descended from medieval additions to the Latin tongue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the disruption of international intercourse by the
collapse of Rome, the introverting poverty of the Dark Ages, the decay
of roads and the decline of commerce, developed in speech those
variations which segregation soon expands. Even in its heyday Latin had
suffered national modifications from diversities of climate and oral
physiology. In its very homeland the old language had been changed. The
abdication of literature had left the field to the vocabulary and
sentence structure of the common man, which had al- ways been different
from those of the poets and orators. The influx of Ger- mans, Gauls,
Greeks, and Asiatics into Italy brought a multiformity of pro-
nunciation; and the natural laziness of tongue and mind sloughed off
the</p>
<p>9°3</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>9°4</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>precise inflections and terminations of careful speech. H became
silent in late Latin; V, classically pronounced like the English W,
acquired the sound of the English V; N before S dropped away — mensa
(table) was pronounced mesa; the diphthongs /E and (E, classically
pronounced like the English I and OI, were now like long English A or
French E. As final consonants were slurred and forgotten ( portus ,
porto, porte; rex, re, roi; coelum, cielo, del), case endings had to be
replaced by prepositions, conjugational endings by auxiliary verbs. The
old demonstrative pronouns ille and ilia became definite articles — il,
el, lo, le, la; and the Latin unus (one) was shortened to form the
indefinite article un. As declensions disappeared, it sometimes became
diffi- cult to tell whether a noun was the subject before, or the object
after, the predicate. Viewing this continuous process of change over
twenty centu- ries, we may think of Latin as the still living and
literary language of Italy, France, and Spain, no more transformed from
the speech of Cicero than his from that of Romulus, or ours from
Chaucer’s.</p>
<p>Spain had begun to speak Latin as early as 200 b.c.; by Cicero’s time
its dia - lect had diverged so far from the usage of Rome that Cicero
was shocked by what seemed to him the barbarisms of Corduba. Contact
with Iberian dialects softened the Latin consonants in Spain: T into D,
P into B, K into G; totum into todo, operam into obra, ecdesia into
iglesia. French also softened the Latin consonants, and while often
keeping them in writing, frequently dropped them in speech: tout,
oeuvre, eglise, est. The oath taken at Stras- bourg in 842 by Louis the
German and Charles the Bald was sworn in two languages — German and
French * — a French still so Latin that it was called lingua romana; not
till the tenth century was it sufficiently distinct to receive the name
lingua gallica. The lingua romana in turn divided into what France
called two languages: the longue (Toe of France south of the Loire, and
the langue d’o’il of northern France. It was a medieval custom to
differentiate dialects by their way of saying yes : South France said it
with oc from the Latin hoc, this; the North used oil, a fusion of the
Latin hoc ille, this-that. Southeastern France had a dialect of t he
langue d’oc called Provencal; it be - came a polished literary language
in the hands of the troubadours, and was almost snuffed out by the
Albigensian Crusades.</p>
<p>Italy formed her vernacular more slowly than Spain or France. Latin
was her native speech; the clergy, who spoke Latin, were especially
numerous in Italy; and the continuity of her culture and her schools
kept the language from changing so freely as in lands with broken
traditions. As late as 1230 * The first three lines will indicate ho w
slowly French and German evolved: “Pro Deo amur et pro Christian poblo
et nostro commun salvament, dist di in avant, in quant Deus savir et
podir me dunat.”</p>
<p>“In Gedes minna ind in these Christianes folches ind unser bedhero
gealtnissi, fon thesemo d age frammordes, so fram so mir Got gewizci
indi madh furgibit.”</p>
<p>English translation: “For the love or God, and for the Christian
people and our common salvation, from this day forth, as God may give me
wisdom and strength.” 1</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV ) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 905</p>
<p>St. Anthony of Padua preached to the common people in Latin; however,
a Latin sermon delivered at Padua in 1 1 89 by a visiting prelate had to
be trans- lated by the local bishop into the popular tongue. 2 Italian
hardly existed as a language at the beginning of the thirteenth century;
there were merely some fourteen dialects continued and variously
corrupted from the ancient Latin of the market place, each barely
intelligible to the rest, and cherishing its dif- ferences with
passionate atomism; sometimes different quarters of the same city, as at
Bologna, had distinct dialects. The predecessors of Dante had to create
a language as well as a literature. The poet, in a pleasant fancy,
thought that the Tuscan troubadours chose Italian as their medium
because they wrote of love, and the ladies they addressed might not
understand Latin. 3 Even so, about 1300, he hesitated between Latin and
the Tuscan dialect as the language of The Divine Comedy. By the narrow
margin of this choice he escaped oblivion.</p>
<p>While Latin was dividing reproductively into the Romance languages,
Old German was splitting into Middle German, Frisian, Dutch, Flemish,
English, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic. “Old German” is
merely a convenient phrase to cover the many dialects that exercised
their tribal or provincial sovereignty in Germany before 1050: Flemish,
Dutch, Westphalian, Eastphalian, Alemannic, Bavarian, Franconian,
Thuringian, Saxon, Silesian. . . . Old German passed into Middle German
(1050-1500) partly through the influx of new words with the coming of
Christianity. Monks from Ireland, England, France, and Italy labored to
invent terms to translate Latin. Sometimes they appropriated Latin words
bodily into Ger- man — Kaiser, Prinz , Legende. This was legitimate
thievery; tragic, however, was the influence of Latin sentence structure
— keeping the verb to the end- in changing the once simple syntax of the
German people into the stiff, in- verted, and breath-taking periods of
the later German style. 4 Perhaps the finest German was the Middle High
German written by the great poets of the thirteenth century — Walter von
der Vogelweide, Hartmann von Aue, Gottfried of Strasbourg, Wolfram von
Eschenbach. Never again, except in Heine and the young Goethe, was
German so simple, flexible, direct, clear.</p>
<p>The Teutonic speech of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes went with them
to England in the fifth century, and laid the foundations of the English
lan- guage — gave it almost all its short and racy words. French flooded
the land with the Normans, and ruled the court, the courts, and the
aristocracy from 1066 to 1362, while Latin continued to preside over
religion and education, and (till 1731) remained de rigueur in official
documents. Thousands of French words entered into English, above all in
costume, cookery, and law; half the terminology of English law is
French. 5 For three centuries the liter- atures of France and England
were one; and as late as Chaucer ( 1 340-1400) the spirit and language
of English letters were half French. After the loss of her French
possessions England was thrown back upon herself, and the</p>
<p>9 0&lt; 5 the age of faith (chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon elements in English speech triumphed. When the French
dom- ination passed, the English language had been immeasurably
enriched. By adding French and Latin to its German base, English could
triply express any one of a thousand ideas ( kingly , royal, regal-,
twofold, double, duplex-, daily, journal, diurnal , . . .); to this it
owes its wealth of discriminating synonyms and verbal nuances. He who
should know the history of words would know all history.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE WORLD OF BOOKS</li>
</ol>
<p>How were these diverse languages written? After the fall of Rome in
476 the conquering barbarians adopted the Latin alphabet, and wrote it
with a “cursive” or running hand that bound the letters together and
gave most of them a curved form instead of the straight lines that had
been found con- venient in writing upon hard surfaces like stone or
wood. The Church pre- ferred in those centuries a “majuscule,” or large
-letter writing, to facilitate the reading of missals and books of
hours. When the copyists of Charle- magne’s time preserved Latin
literature by making many copies of the clas- sics, they saved costly
parchment by adopting a “minuscule,” or small -letter writing; they
agreed on set forms for the letters, and created the “set minus - cule”
lettering that became for four centuries the usual medium of medieval
books. In the twelfth century, as if in accord with the exuberant
decoration then developing in Gothic architecture, the letters acquired
flourishes, hair- lines, and hooks, and became the “Gothic” lettering
that prevailed in Europe till the Renaissance, and in Germany till our
time. Very few medieval manu- scripts were punctuated; this
breath-guiding device, known to the Hellenis- tic Greeks, had been lost
in the barbarian upheaval; it reappeared in the thir- teenth century,
but was not generally adopted till printing established it in the
fifteenth century. Printing was in some measure prepared as early as 1
147 by the use of woodcuts, in Rhenish monasteries, for printing initial
letters or patterns upon textiles. 6 Divers forms of shorthand were
practiced, much in- ferior to the “Tironian notes” developed by Cicero’s
slave.</p>
<p>Writing was upon parchment, papyrus, vellum, or paper, with quill or
reed pens using black or colored inks. Papyrus disappeared from common
use in Europe after the Islamic conquest of Egypt. Vellum, prepared from
the skin of young lambs, was expensive, and was reserved for luxurious
manu- scripts. Parchment, made from coarse sheepskin, was the usual
medium of medieval writing. Till the twelfth century paper was a costly
import from Islam; but in 1190 paper mills were set up in Germany and
France, and in the thirteenth century Europe began to make paper from
linen.</p>
<p>Many parchments were scraped to erase an old manuscript and receive a
second composition (“palimpsest”). Old work s were lost by such
erasures, by misplacement of manuscripts, by war and pillage, by fire or
decay. Huns sacked monastic libraries in Bavaria, Northmen in France,
Saracens in Italy.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 907</p>
<p>A 4 any Greek classics perished in the plunder of Constantinople in
1204. The Church had at first discountenanced the reading of the pagan
classics; in nearly every century some fearful voice — Gregory I,
Isidore of Seville, Peter Damian — was raised against them; Theophilus,
Archbishop of Alexandria, destroyed all pagan manuscripts that he could
find; and Greek priests, ac- cording to Demetrius Chalcondylas, 7
persuaded Greek emperors to burn the works of the Greek erotic poets,
including Sappho and Anacreon. But in those same centuries there were
many ecclesiastics who cherished a fondness for the old pagans, and saw
to it that their works were preserved. In some cases, to disarm censure,
they read the most Christian sentiments into pagan poetry, and by genial
allegory t urned even Ovid’s amatory art into moral verse. An abundant
heritage of classical literature was preserved by monas- tic copyists. 8
Tired monks were told that God would forgive one of their sins for every
line they copied; Ordericus Vitalis informs us that one monk escaped
hell by the margin of a single letter. 9 Second only to the monks as
copyists were private or professional scribes, who were engaged by rich
men, or by booksellers, or by monasteries. Their labor was wearisome,
and evoked from them strange requests on the final page:</p>
<p>Explicit hoc totum; This completes the whole;</p>
<p>Pro Christo da mihi potum. For Christ’s sake give me a drink. 10</p>
<p>Another scribe thought he deserved more, and wrote, as his colophon:
Detur pro penna scriptori pule hr a puella — “For the 〔work of the〕
pen let the writer receive a beautiful girl.” 11</p>
<p>The medieval Church exercised no regular censorship over the
publication of books. If a book proved both heretical and influential,
like Abelard’s on the Trinity, it would be denounced by a Church
council. But books were then too few to be a prime peril to orthodoxy.
Even the Bible was rare out- side of monasteries; a year was required to
copy it, a year’s income of a parish priest to buy it; few clergymen had
a full copy. 12 The New Testa- ment, and special books of the Old, had a
wider circulation. Bibles of great size, magnificently decorated, were
produced in the twelfth century; they could be handled only on a reading
desk, usually in a monastic library, and might be chained to the desk
for better preservation. The Church took fright when she found that the
Waldensians and Albigensians were making and disseminating their own
translations of scriptural books; and a Church council at Narbonne
(1227), as we have seen, forbade laymen to possess any portion of the
Scriptures. 13 But in general, before the fourteenth cen- tury, the
Church was not opposed to Bible reading on the part of the laity. She
did not encourage it, for she distrusted popular interpretations of
scrip- tural mysteries.</p>
<p>The size of a book and its pages was determined by the size of the
avail- able skins, each of which was folded to make a “folio.” After the
fifth cen -</p>
<p>908 the age of faith (chap, xxxiv</p>
<p>tury books were no longer issued in rolls as in antiquity; * the
skins were cut in rectangular sizes to make four (“quarto”), eight
(“octavo”), twelve (“duodecimo”), or sixteen (“sextodecimo”) sheets to a
folio. Some sexto - decimos, written in a “fine Italian hand,” crowded
long w orks into small compass to fit into the pocket or be a convenient
manual. The binding might be of heavy parchment, cloth, leather, or
board. Leather covers might be decorated by “blind tooling”— i.e.,
stamping uncolored designs into them with hot metal dies. Moslem artists
settled in Venice introduced into Europe the technique of filling in
such depressed parts with gold tints. Wood covers might be decorated
with enamel or carved ivory, or inlaid with gold, silver, or gems.
St. Jerome rebuked the Rom ans: “Your books are carved with precious
stones, and Christ died naked!” 14 Few modern volumes rival the
sumptuous bindings of medieval books.</p>
<p>Even simple books were a luxury. An ordinary volume cost between 60
and 00 in the currency of the United States of America in 1949. 15
Bernard of Chartres, a leader in the twelfth-century revival of the
ancient classics, left a library of only twenty-four volumes. Italy was
richer than France, and its famous jurist, the elder Accursius,
collected sixty-three books. We hear of a great Bible being sold for ten
talents — at least 0,000; of a missal exchanged for a vineyard; of two
volumes of Priscian, the fifth-century grammarian, being paid for with a
house and lot. 10 The cost of books de- layed the r ise of a
booksellers’ trade till the twelfth century; then the uni - versity
towns engaged men as stationarii and librarii to organize corps of
copyists to transcribe books for teachers and students; and these men
sold copies to all who cared to pay. They seem never to have dreamed of
pay- ing a live author. If a man insisted on writing a new book, he had
to pay its costs, or find a king or lord or magnate to grace his palm
for a dedication or a laud. He could not advertise his book except by
word of mouth. He could not publish it — make it public — except by
getting it used in a school, or having it recited before whatever
audience he could collect. So Gerald of Wales, on returning from Ireland
in 1200, read his Topography of that country before an assemblage at
Oxford.</p>
<p>The cost of books, and the dearth of funds for schools, produced a
degree of illiteracy which would have seemed shameful to ancient Greece
or Rome. North of the Alps, before 1 1 00, literacy was almost confined
to “clerics”— clergymen, accountants, scribes, governmental officials,
and professional men. In the twelfth century the business classes must
have been literate, for they kept elaborate accounts. In a household a
book was a precious thing. Usually it was read aloud to several
listeners; many later rules of punctua- tion and style were determined
by convenience for oral reading. Books were</p>

<li>Many government records continued to be written on rolls; such “pipe
rolls” were used in England from 1131 to 1833. The keeper of these
archives was “Master of the Rolls.”</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 909</p>
<p>carefully exchanged from family to family, monastery to monastery,
coun- try to country.</p>
<p>Libraries, though small, were numerous. St. Benedict had ruled that
every Benedictine monastery should have a library. Carthusian and
Cistercian houses, despite St. Bernard’s aversion to learning, became
sedulous collectors of books. Many cathedrals — Toledo, Barcelona,
Bamberg, Hildesheim — had substantial libraries; Canterbury had 5000
books in 1300. But this was ex- ceptional; 17 most libraries had less
than a hundred; Cluny, one of the best, had 570 volumes. 18 Manfred,
King of the Sicilies, had a valuable collection, which passed to the
papacy and became the nucleus of the Greek collec- tions in the Vatican.
The papal library began with Pope Damasus (366-84) ; its precious
manuscripts and archives were mostly lost in the turmoil of the
thirteenth century; the present Vatican Library dates from the fifteenth
cen- tury. The universities — or, rather, their college halls — began to
have libraries in the twelfth century. St. Louis founded the library of
Sainte Chapelle in Paris, and enriched it with books copied for him from
a hundred monas- teries. Many libraries, like those of Notre Dame,
St. Germain des Pres, and the Sorbonne, were open to responsible
students, and volumes might be taken out on adequate security. The
student of today can hardly appreciate the literary wealth that city and
college libraries lay freely at his feet.</p>
<p>There were, here and there, private libraries. Even in the darkness
of the tenth century we find Gerbert collecting books with true
bibliophile pas- sion. Some other churchmen, like John of Salisbury, had
their own col- lections, and a few nobles had small libraries in their
chateaux. Frederick Barbarossa and Frederick II had considerable
collections. Henry of Aragon, lord of Villena in Spain, gathered a great
library, which was publicly burned on the charge that he had intercourse
with the Devil. 19 About 1200 Daniel of Morley brought to England from
Spain “a precious multitude of books.” 20 In the twelfth century Europe
discovered the wealth of Spain in books; scholars descended upon Toledo,
Cordova, and Seville; and a flood of new learning poured up over the
Pyrenees to revolutionize the intellectual life of the adolescent
North.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE TRANSLATORS</li>
</ol>
<p>Medieval Europe, partly united by a common language, was still
divided into Latin and Greek halves, mutually hostile and ignorant. The
Latin heri- tage, except of law, was forgotten in the Greek East; the
Greek heritage, except in the Sicilies, was forgotten in the West. Part
of the Greek heritage was hidden beyond the walls of Christendom — in
Moslem Jerusalem, Alex- andria, Cairo, Tunis, Sicily, and Spain. As for
the vast and distant world</p>
<p>910 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>of India, China, and Japan, long rich in literature, philosophy, and
art, Chris- tians, before the thirteenth century, knew almost
nothing.</p>
<p>Some of the work of linking the diverse cultures was performed by the
Jews, who moved among them like fertilizing subterranean streams. As
more and more Jews migrated from Moslem realms into Christendom, and
lost knowledge of Arabic, their scholars found it desirable to translate
Arabic works (many written by Jews) into the only language generally
understood by the savants of the scat- tered race — Hebrew. So Joseph
Kimchi ( c . 1105-^. 1170), at Narbonne, trans- lated the Jewish
philosopher Bahya’s Guid e to the Duties of the Heart . Joseph was the
father of brilliant sons; but even more important, as translators, were
the progeny of Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon ( c . ii2o-£. 1 190). He too,
like Kimchi, had moved from Moslem Spain to southern France; and though
he was one of the most successful physicians of his time, he found
energv to translate into Hebrew the Judeo-Arabic works of Saadia Gaon,
Ibn Gabirol, and Jehuda Halevi. His son Samuel ( c . 1 150-^. 1232)
stirred the Jewish world by translating into Hebrew Maimonides’ Guide to
the Perplexed . Samuel’s son Moses ibn Tibbcn translated - to tle.
Samuel’s grandson Jacob ibn Tibbon, besides leading the fight for Mai -
monides in Montpellier, and earning fame as an astronomer, translated
several Arabic treatises into Hebrew, and some into Latin. Samuel’s
daughter married a still more famous scholar, Jacob Anatoli. Born in
Marseille about 1 194, Jacob was invited by Frederick II to teach Hebrew
at the University of Naples; there he translated into Hebrew the larger
commentaries of Averroes, profoundly affect- ing Jewish philosophy. A
like stimulus was given to Hebrew medicine through the translation of
al- Razi’s Kit ah al -Mansuri by the physician and philosopher Shem Tob
at Marseille (1264).</p>
<p>Many Hebrew translations from the Arabic were rendered into Latin; so
a Hebrew version of Avenzoar ’s T ay sir, or Aid to Health , was turned
into Latin at Padua (1280). Early in the thirteenth century a Jew
translated the entire Old Testament directly and literally into Latin.
The devious routes of cultural migra- tion are exemplified by the Fables
of Bidpai, which were translated into English from a Spanish translation
of a Latin translation of a Hebrew translation of an Arabic translation
of a Pahlavi translation of the supposedly original Sanskrit.- 1</p>
<p>The main stream whereby the riches of Islamic thought were poured
into the Christian West was by translation from Arabic into Latin. About
1060 Con- stantine the African translated into Latin al- Razi’s Liber
Experimentorum , the Arabic medical works of Isaac Judaeus, and Hunain’s
Arabic version of Hippoc- rates’ Aphorisms and Galen’s Commentary . At
Toledo, soon after its conquest from the Moors, the enlightened and
tolerant Archbishop Raymond ( c . 1130) organized a corps of translators
under Dominico Gundisalvi, and commissioned them to translate Arabic
works of science and philosophy. Most of the trans- lators were Jews who
knew Arabic, Hebrew, and Spanish, sometimes also Latin. The busiest
member of the group was a converted Jew, John of Spain (or “of
Seville”), whose Arabic patronymic , ibn Daud (son of David), was
remodeled by the Schooltnen into Avendeath. John translated a veritable
library of Arabic</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 911</p>
<p>and Jewish works by Avicenna, al-Ghazali, al-Farabi . . . and
al-Khwarizmi; through this last work he introduced the Hindu-Arabic
numerals to the West. 22 Almost as influential was his rendering of a
pseudo-Aristotelian book of philoso- phy and occultism, the Secretum
Secretorum, whose wide circulation is indicated by the survival of 200
manuscripts. Some of these translations were made directly from Arabic
into Latin; some were made into Castilian and then translated into Latin
by Gundisalvi. In this way the two scholars transformed Ibn Gabirol’s
Mekor Hayim into that Fons Vitae , o r Fountain of Life , which made
“Avice - bron” into one of the most famous philosophers in the
Scholastic ken.</p>
<p>Minor tributaries fed the Arabic-Latin current. Adelard of Bath,
having learned Arabic in Antioch, Tarsus, and Toledo, made from an
Arabic version the first Latin rendering of Euclid (1120), and
introduced Moslem trigonometry to the West by translating the
astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi (1126). 23 In 1141 Peter the
Venerable, Abbot of Cluny, with the aid of three Christian scholars and
an Arab, turned the Koran into Latin. Moslem alchemy and chemistry en-
tered the Latin world through a translation of an Arabic text by Robert
of Chester in 1144. A year later an Italian, Plato of Tivoli, translated
the epochal treatise Hibbur ha-meshihah of the Jewish mathematician
Abraham bar Hiyya.</p>
<p>The greatest of the translators was Gerard of Cremona. Arriving in
Toledo about 1165, he was impressed by the wealth of Arabic literature
in science and philosophy. He resolved to translate the best of it into
Latin, and spent the re- maining nine years of his life in the task. He
learned Arabic, and apparently had the help of a native Christian and a
Jew; 24 it seems incredible that he should have made his seventy-one
translations unaided. To him the West owed Latin versions of Arabic
versions of Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics , On the Heavens and the
Earth , On Generation and Corruption , and Meteorology ; several
commentaries by Alexander of Aphrodisias; Euclid’s Elements and Data ;
Archimedes’ On the Measurement of the Circle ; Apollonius of Perga’s
Conics ; eleven works ascribed to Galen; several works of Greek
astronomy; four volumes of Greco-Arabic physics; eleven books of Arabic
medicine, including the largest works of al-Razi and Avicenna; al-Farabi
On the Syllogism ; three works by al-Kindi, and two by Isaac Israeli;
fourteen works of Arabic mathematics and astronomy; three sets of
astronomical tables; and seven Arabic works on geomancy and astrology.
No other man in history has ever done so much to enrich one culture with
another. We can only compare Gerard’s industry with that of Hunain ibn
Ishaq and al- Mamun’s “House of Wisdom,” which in the ninth century had
poured Greek science and philosophy into an Arabic mold.</p>
<p>Next to Spain as donor in this transfusion of culture was the Norman
kingdom of the Sicilies. Soon after their conquest of the island (1091)
the Norman rulers employed translators to turn into Latin the Arabic or
Greek works on mathe- matics and astronomy then current in Palermo.
Frederick II, at Foggia, carried on the work, and partly for that
purpose brought to his court one of the strangest and most active minds
of the early thirteenth century. Michael Scot derived his cognomen from
his native Scotland. We find him at Toledo in 1217, in Bologna in 1220,
in Rome in 1224-7, thereafter at Foggia or Naples. His first important
translation was al- Bitruji’s Spherics , a critique of Ptolemy.
Fascinated by dis -</p>
<p>912 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>covering the sc ope and freedom of Aristotle’s thought, Scot
translated into Latin, from Arabic versions, the History of Animals ,
including On the Farts of Animals and On the Generation of Animals ; and
an unverified tradition ascribed to him translations of the Metaphysics
, the Physics , On the Soul , On the Heavens, per- haps also the Ethics
. Michael’s versions of Aristotle reached Albertus Magnus and Roger
Bacon, and stirred the development of science in the thirteenth cen-
tury. Charles of Anjou continued the royal patronage of translators in
southern Italy; the Jewish savant Moses of Salerno worked for him, and
it was probably Charles who financed the Latin translation (1274) of al-
Razi’s medical leviathan, the Liber Continens , by the Jewish scholar
Faraj ben Salim of Girgenti.</p>
<p>All the Latin translations, so far mentioned, of Greek science and
philosophy were made from Arabic versions — sometimes from Arabic
versions of Syriac ver- sions — of the already obscure originals. They
were not as inaccurate as Roger Bacon charged, but there was clearly
need of more direct renderings. Among the earliest such versions were
those made of Aristotle’s T opics , Ele?ichi, and Pos - terior Analytics
by James, known to us only as “a clerk of Venice,” at some time befo re
1128. In 1154 Eugene “the Emir” of Palermo translated the Optics of
Ptolemy; and in 1160 he shared in a Latin translation of the Almagest
directly from the Greek. Meanwhile Aristippus of Catania had translated
( c . 1156) The Lives of the Philosophers by Diogenes Laertius, and the
Mena and Phaedo of Plato. The capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders
had less result in trans- lations than might have been expected; we hear
only of a partial version of Aris- totle’s Metaphysics (1209). A fallow
int erval ensued; then, about 1260, William of Moerbeke, Flemish
Archbishop of Corinth, began, probably with aides, a series of direct
translations from the Greek whose number and importance rank him only
next to Gerard of Cremona among the heroes of cultural transmission. It
was partly at the request of his friend and fellow Dominican Thomas
Aquinas that he translated so many of Aristotle’s works: the History of
Animals, 0 ?i the Generation of Animals, Politics, and Rhetoric, and
completed or revised earlier direct versions of the Metaphysics , the
Meteorology, and On the Soul. For St. Thomas he translated several Greek
commentaries on Aristotle or Plato. For good measure he added versions
of Hippocrates’ Prognostics, Galen On Foods, and divers works in physics
by Hero of Alexandria and Archimedes. Perhaps we owe to him also a
translation — formerly ascribed to Robert Grosseteste — of Aristotle’s
Ethics . These translations provided part of the material from which
St. Thomas built his magistral Smmna Theologica. By 1280 Aristotle had
been almost com- pletely transmitted to the Western mind.</p>
<p>The effects of all these translations upon Latin Europe were
revolutionary. The influx of texts from Islam and Greece profoundly
stirred the reawak- ening world of scholarship, compelled new
developments in grammar and philology, enlarged the curriculum of the
schools, and shared in the aston- ishing growth of universities in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It was merely an incident that,
through the inability of the translators to find Latin equivalents, many
Arabic words were now introduced into the languages of Europe. It was
more important that algebra, the zero, and the decimal sys-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI v) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 913</p>
<p>tem entered the Christian West through these versions; that the
theory and practice of medicine were powerfully advanced by the
translation of the Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Jewish masters; and that
the importation of Greek and Arabic astronomy compelled an expansion of
theology, and a recon- ception of deity, prefacing the greater change
that would follow Coperni- cus. The frequent references of Roger Bacon
to Averroes, Avicenna, and “Alfarabius” give one measure of the new
influence and stimulation; “phi - losophy,” said Bacon, “has come down
to us from the Arabs”; 25 and we shall see that Thomas Aquinas was led
to write his Summas to halt the threatened liquidation of Christian
theology by Arabic interpretations of Aristotle. Islam had now repaid to
Europe the learning that it had borrowed through Syria from Greece. And
as that learning had aroused the great age of Arabic sci- ence and
philosophy, so now it would excite the European mind to inquiry and
speculation, would force it to build the intellectual cathedral of Scho-
lastic philosophy, and would crack stone after stone of that majestic
edifice to bring the collapse of the medieval system in the fourteenth
century, and the beginnings of modern philosophy in the ardor of the
Renaissance.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE SCHOOLS</li>
</ol>
<p>The transmission of culture from generation to generation was
undertaken by the family, the Church, and the school. Moral education
was stressed in the Middle Ages at the expense of intellectual
enlightenment, as intellectual education is today stressed at the
expense of moral discipline. In England it was not unusual, in the
middle and upper classes, to send a boy of seven or so to be brought up
for a time in another home, partly to cement family friendships, partly
to offset the laxity of parental love. 26 The splendid school system of
the Roman Empire had decayed in the tumult of invasion and the
depopulation of the towns. When the tidal wave of migration subsided in
the sixth century a few lay schools survived in Italy; the rest were
mostly schools for training converts and prospective priests. For some
time (500-</p>
<ol start="800" type="1">
<li>the Church gave all her attention to moral training, and did not
reckon the transmission of secular knowledge as one of her functions.
But under the prodding of Charlemagne cathedrals, monasteries, parish
churches, and convents opened schools for the general education of boys
and girls.</li>
</ol>
<p>At first the monastic schools bore nearly all this burden. A schola
interior provided instruction for novices or oblates, and a schola
exterior offered education to boys, apparently without charge. 27 In
Germany these monas- tic schools survived the disorders of the ninth
century, and shared produc- tively in the Ottonian Renaissance; in the
ninth and tenth centuries Germany led France in the graces of the mind.
In France the disintegration of the Carolingian house, and the raids of
the Northmen, struck cruel blows at the</p>
<p>914 THE AGE ° E faith (chap, xxxiv</p>
<p>monastic schools. The palace school that Charlemagne had established
at the Frank court did not long outlive Charles the Bald (d. 877). The
French episcopacy grew stronger as the kings grew weaker; when the Norse
raids subsided the bishops and secular clergy were richer than the
abbots and the monasteries; and while the monastic schools declined in
the tenth century, cathedral schools rose at Paris, Chartres, Orleans,
Tours, Laon, Reims, Liege, and Cologne. When the good and great Fulbert
died at Chartres, Bishop Ivo (io 4 o?-iii 6 ) maintained the standards
and renown of its cathedral school in classical studies; and this fine
tradition was carried on by Ivo’s successor Bernard of Chartres, whom
John of Salisbury, in the twelfth century, de- scribed as “in modern
times the most astounding spring of letters in Gaul.” 2 8 In England the
cathedral school of York was famous even before it gave Alcuin to
Charlemagne. The school of Canterbury became almost a univer- sity, with
an abundant library, and no less a man as secretary than the afore- said
John of Salisbury, one of the sanest scholars and philosophers of the
Middle Ages. In such schools those students who were preparing for the
priesthood were apparently supported by cathedral funds, while others
paid a modest fee. The Third Lateran Council ( 1179) decreed that “in
order that the opportunity of reading and making progress may not be
taken away from poor children … let some sufficient benefice be assigned
in every cathedral church for a master who shall teach gratis the clerks
of the same church, and poor s cholars.” 29 The Fourth Lateran Council
(1215) required the establishment of a chair of grammar in every
cathedral of the Christian world, and instructed each archbishop to
maintain also chairs of philosophy and canon law. 80 The decretals of
Pope Gregory IX (1227-41) directed every parish church to organize a
school of elementary instruction; and re- cent researches indicate that
such parochial schools — chiefly devoted to reli- gious instruction —
were common throughout Christendom. 31</p>
<p>What proportion of the adolescent population went to school? Of girls
apparently only the well-to-do. Most convents maintained schools for
girls, like that which at Argenteuil gave such excellent classical
training to Helo’fse ( c . 1 1 10); but these schools probably reached
only a modest percentage of girls. Some cathedral schools admitted
girls; Abelard speaks of the “women of noble birth” who attended his
school at Notre Dame in Paris in 1 1 14. 82 Boys had a better chance,
but it was presumably difficult for the son of a serf to get an
education; 33 however, we hear of serfs who managed to get sons into
Oxford. 34 Much that is now taught in schools was then learned at home
or through apprenticeship in shops; certainly the spread and excel-
lence of medieval art suggest wide opportunities for training in arts
and crafts. One calculation reckons the number of boys in elementary
schools in England in 1530 at 26,000 in an estimated population of
5,000,000 — about one thirtieth of the proportion in 1931; 85 but a
recent study concludes that</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 915</p>
<p>“the thirteenth century made a closer approach to popular and social
edu - cation than the sixteenth.” 36</p>
<p>Normally the cathedral school was directed by a canon of the
cathedral chapter, variously called archiscola , scolarius, or
scholasticus. The teachers were clerks in minor orders. All instruction
was in Latin. Discipline was severe; flogging was considered as
necessary in education as hell in religion; Winchester School greeted
its students with a frank hexameter: Aut disce aut discede; manet sors
tertia caedi — “Learn or depart; a third alternative is to be flogged.”
37 The curriculum began with the “trivium”— grammar, rhetoric, logic —
and passed on to the “quadrivium”— arithmetic, geometry, music,
astronomy; these were the “seven liberal arts.” These terms did not then
bear quite their modern meaning. Trivium, of course, meant three ways.
Liberal arts were those that Aristotle had defined as the proper
subjects for freemen who sought not practical skills (which were left to
ap- prentices) but intellectual and moral excellence. 38 Varro (116-27 B
- c -) had written Nine Books of Disciplines , listing nine studies as
constituting the Greco-Roman curriculum; Martianus Capella, a North
African scholar of the fifth century a.d., in a widely used pedagogical
allegory On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury, had barred medicine
and architecture as too practical; and the famous seven remained.
“Grammar” was not the dull study that loses the soul of a language in
studying its bones; it was the art of writing ( grapho , gramma’) ;
Cassiodorus defined it as such study of great poetry and oratory as
would enable one to write with correctness and ele- gance. In medieval
schools it began with the Psalms, passed to other books of the Bible,
then to the Latin Fathers, then to the Latin classics — Cicero, Virgil,
Horace, Statius, Ovid. Rhetoric continued to mean the art of speak- ing,
but again included considerable study of literature. Logic seems a
rather advanced subject for the trivium, but perhaps it was good that
students should learn to reason as early as they loved to argue.</p>
<p>The economic revolution brought some changes in the educational
scene. Cities that lived by commerce and industry felt a need for
employees with practical training; and against much ecclesiastical
opposition they established secular schools in which lay teachers gave
instruction in return for fees paid by the parents of the pupils. In
1300 the fee for a year in a private grammar school in Oxford was four
or five pence (.50). Villani in 1283 reck- oned 9000 boys and girls in
the church schools of Florence, 1100 in six “abacus” schools that
prepared them for a business career, and 57 5 pupils in secondary
schools. Secular schools appeared in Flanders in the twelfth century; by
the second half of the thirteenth the movement had spread to Liibeck and
the Baltic cities. In 1292 we hear of a schoolmistress keeping a private
school in Paris; soon she was one of many. 39 The secularization of
education was on its way.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>V. UNIVERSITIES OF THE SOUTH</p>
<p>Secular schools were especially numerous in Italy; teachers there
were usually laymen, not clerics as beyond the Alps. In general the
spirit and cul- ture of Italy were less ecclesiastical than elsewhere;
indeed, about the year 970, one Vilgardus organized at Ravenna a
movement for the restoration of paganism. 40 There were, of course, many
cathedral schools; those of Milan, Pavia, Aosta, and Parma were
particularly competent, as we may judge from such graduates as Lanfranc
and Anselm; and Monte Cassino under Desiderius was almost a university.
The survival of municipal insti- tutions, the successful resistance of
the Lombard cities to Barbarossa ( 1 176), and the rising demand for
legal and commercial knowledge worked together to give Italy the honor
of establishing the first medieval university.</p>
<p>In 1925 the University of Pavia celebrated the eleven hundredth
anniver- sary of its foundation by Lothair I. Probably this was a school
of law rather than a university; it was not till 1361 that it received
its charter as a stadium generate — the medieval name for a university
uniting diverse faculties. It was one of many schools that from the
ninth century onward revived the study of Roman law: Rome, Ravenna, and
Orleans in the ninth century, Milan, Narbonne, and Lyons in the tenth,
Verona, Mantua, and Angers in the eleventh. Bologna was apparently the
first of the West European cities to enlarge its school into a stadium
generate. In 1076, says the chronicler Odofredus, a “certain master Pepo
began by his own authority to lecture on the laws … at Bologna, and he
was a man of the gre atest renown.” 41 Other teachers joined him; and by
the time of Irnerius the Bologna school of law was by common consent the
best in Europe.</p>
<p>Irnerius began to teach law at Bologna in 1088. Whether his studies
of Roman law convinced him of the historical and practical arguments for
the supremacy of the imperial over the ecclesiastical power, or whether
the re- wards of imperial service attracted him, he turned from the
Guelf to the Ghibelline side, and interpreted the revived jurisprudence
to favor imperial claims. Appreciative emperors contributed funds to the
school, and a swarm of German students came down to Bologna. Irnerius
composed a volume of glosses, or comments, on the Corpus iuris of
Justinian, and applied scien- tific method to the organization of law.
The Swmna codicis Imerii, compiled by him or from his lectures, is a
masterpiece of exposition and argument.</p>
<p>With Irnerius began the golden age of medieval jurisprudence. Men
from every country in Latin Europe came to Bologna to learn the
rejuvenated science of the law. Irnerius’ pupil Gratian applied the new
methods to eccle - siastical legislation, and published the first code
of canon law (1139). After Irnerius the “Four Doctors”— Bulgarus,
Martinus, Iacobus, and Hugo — in a series of famous glosses, applied the
Justinian Code to the legal problems</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIv) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 917</p>
<p>of the twelfth century, and secured the adoption of Roman law in an
ever-widening sphere. Early in the thirteenth century the elder
Accursius (1 i85?- i26o), the greatest of the “glossators,” summed up
their work and his own in a Glossa ordinaria, which became the standard
authority by which kings and communes broke the sway of feudal law, and
fought the power of the popes. The papacy did what it could to halt this
exhumation of a code that made religion a function and servant of the
state; but the new study fed and expressed the bold rationalism and
secularization of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and raised a
proliferating class of lawyers who labored to reduce the role of the
Church in government, and to extend the authority of the state.
St. Bernard complained that the courts of Eu- rope rang with the laws of
Justinian and no longer heard the laws of God. 42 The spread of the new
jurisprudence was as strong a stimulus as the Arabic and Greek
translations in generating that respect and passion for reason which was
to beget and bedevil Scholasticism.</p>
<p>We do not know when a school of arts — i.e., the seven liberal arts —
arose in Bologna, nor when was founded its celebrated school of
medicine. So far as we know, the only connection among the three schools
was in the fact that the graduates of any of them received their degrees
from the arch- deacon of Bologna. The professors organized themselves
into a collegium or guild. About 1215 the students, in whatever faculty,
associated themselves into two groups: a universitas citramontanorum or
union of students from south of the Alps, and a universitas
ultramontanorum or union of students from beyond the Alps. From the
beginning of the thirteenth century there were women students in these
“universities,” and in the fourteenth century</p>
<p>The student guilds, originated to provide mutual protection and self-
government, came in the thirteenth century to exercise extraordinary
power over the teaching staffs. By organized boycotts of unsatisfactory
teachers, the students could end the pedagogical career of any man at
Bologna. In many cases the salaries of the professors were paid by the
student “uni - versities,” and the professors were compelled to swear
obedience to the “rectors” of the “universities”— i.e., to the head
officers of the student guilds. 44 A teacher desiring leave of absence,
even for a day, was obliged to obtain permission from his pupils through
their rectors, and he was ex- pressly forbidden to “create holidays at
his pleasure.” 45 Regulations estab - lished by the student guilds
determined at what minute the teacher should begin his lecture, when he
should end it, and what penalties he should pay for deviations from
these rules. If he overtalked his hour the students were instructed by
the guild statutes to leave. Other guild, regulations fined a teacher
for skipping a chapter or decretal in his exposition of the laws, and
determined how much of the course was to be given to each part of the
texts. At the outset of each academic year the professor was required
to</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>918</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>deposit ten pounds with a Bologna bank; from this sum the fines laid
upon him by the rectors were deducted; and the remainder was refunded to
him at the close of the year on instruction from the rectors. Committees
of stu- dents were appointed to observe the conduct of each teacher, and
report irregularities or deficiencies to the rectors. 46 If these
arrangements seem to the modem student unusually sensible, it should be
remembered that the law students at Bologna were men between seventeen
and forty years of age, old enough to provide their own discipline; that
they came to study, not to play; that the professor was not the employee
of trustees, but a free-lance lecturer whom the students in effect
engaged to instruct them. The teach- er’s salary at Bologna consisted of
fees paid him by his students and fixed by agreement with them. This
system of payment was changed toward the end of the thirteenth century
when Italian cities eager to have universities of their own offered
municipal salaries to certain Bolognese professors; the city of Bologna
thereupon ( 1 289) promised to pay two professors an annual stipend; but
the choice of professors was still left to the students. Gradu- ally the
number of these municipal salaria increased; and in the fourteenth
century the selection of professors passed, with their payment, to the
city. When Bologna became part of the Papal States in 1506 the
appointment of the teachers became a function of the ecclesiastical
authorities.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century, however, the University of Bologna, and in
less degree the other universities of Italy, were marked by a lay
spirit, almost an anticlericalism, hardly to be found in other centers
of European educa- tion. Whereas in these others the chief faculty was
theology, there was at Bologna no theological faculty at all before
1364; theology there was re- placed by canon law. Even rhetoric took the
form of law, and the art of writing became — at Bologna, Paris, Orleans,
Montpellier, Tours . . . — the ars dictaminis or ars notaria, the art of
writing legal, business, or official doc- uments; and special degrees
were given in this art. 47 It was a common say- ing that the most
realistic education obtainable was to be had in Bologna; a favorite
story told how a Parisian pedagogue unlearned at Bologna what he had
taught at Paris, and then came back to Paris and untaught it. 48 In the
twelfth century Bologna led the movement of the European mind; in the
thirteenth it allowed its teaching to stiffen into a stagnant
scholasticism of law; the Accursian gloss became a sacred and almost
unchangeable text, impeding the progressive adaptation of law to the
flux of life. The spirit of inquiry fled to freer fields.</p>
<p>Italy broke out into universities in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. Some of them were spawned by Bologna through the emigration
of profes- sors or students; so in 1182 Pillius left to set up a school
in Modena; in 1188 Iacobus de Mandra went to Reggio Emilia and brought
his pupils with him; in 1204 another migration, probably from Bologna,
established a studhim generate, or union of several faculties, at
Vicenza; in 1215 Roffredus left</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 919</p>
<p>the University of Bologna to open a law school at Arezzo; in 1222 a
large secession of teachers and students from Bologna expanded an old
school at Padua. Faculties of medicine and the arts were added to this
school of law at Padua; Venice sent her students there, and contributed
to the professorial salaries paid by the city; and in the fourteenth
century Padua became one of the most vigorous centers of European
thought. In 1224 Frederick II founded the University of Naples to keep
the students of South Italy from flocking north. Perhaps for like
reasons, as well as to train men for ecclesi- astical diplomacy,
Innocent IV established the University of the Court of Rome (1244),
which followed the papal court in its migration, even to Avignon. In
1303 Boniface VIII founded the University of Rome, which rose to glory
under Nicholas V and Leo X, and won the name of Sapienza under Paul III.
Siena inaugurated its municipal university in 1 246, Piacenza in 1 248.
By the end of the thirteenth century schools of law and the arts, and
sometimes schools of medicine too, were to be found in every major city
of Italy.</p>
<p>The universities of Spain were unique in being founded and chartered
by the kings, serving them, and submitting to governmental control.
Castile de- veloped a royal university at Palencia (1208), later at
Valladolid (1304); Leon had one at Salamanca (1227), the Baleares at
Palma ( 1280) , Catalonia at Lerida ( 1 300) . Despite this royal
connection the Spanish universities ac- cepted ecclesiastical
supervision and funds, and some, like Palencia, grew out of cathedral
schools. The University of Salamanca was richly endowed in the
thirteenth century by San Fernando and Alfonso the Wise, and soon stood
on an equal footing of fame and learning with Bologna and Paris. Most of
these institutions gave instruction in Latin, mathematics, astron- omy,
theology, and law; some in medicine, Hebrew, or Greek. A School of
Oriental Studies was opened at Toledo in 1250 by Dominican monks to
teach Arabic and Hebrew; good work must have been done there, for one of
its graduates, Raymond Martin ( c . 1260), showed familiarity with all
major philosophers and theologians of Islam. Arabic studies were
prominent also at the University of Seville, founded by Alfonso the Wise
in 1254. At Lisbon, in 1290, the poet-king Diniz gave a university to
Portugal.</p>

<li>UNIVERSITIES OF FRANCE</li>

<p>The unquestioned leader of the European mind, in the medieval
meridian of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, was France. Its
cathedral schools had from the early eleventh century achieved
international renown. If these schools flowered into a great university
at Paris, rather than at Chartres, Laon, or Reims, it was probably
because the thriving commerce of the Seine,</p>
<p>9 2 0 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXIV</p>

that lures the intellect and finances science, philosophy, and art.</p>
<p>The first known master of the cathedral school of Notre Dame was</p>
<p>William of Champeaux ( 1070?-! 1 2 1 ) ; it was his lectures, given
in the clois- ters of Notre Dame, that stirred up the intellectual
movement out of which the University of Paris grew. When ( c . 1 103)
Abelard came out of Brittany, slew William with a syllogism, and began
the most famous lectures in French history, students flocked to hear
him. The schools of Paris swelled their ranks, and masters multiplied. A
master ( magister ), in the educational world of twelfth-century Paris,
was a man licensed to teach by the chancellor of the Cathedral of Notre
Dame. The University of Paris rose by now un- traceable steps from the
church schools of the city, and derived its first unity from this single
source of pedagogical licensing. Normally the license was given gratis
to anyone who had been for an adequate period the pupil of an authorized
master, and whose application was approved by that master. It was one of
the charges made against Abelard that he had set himself up as a teacher
without having served such an approved apprenticeship.</p>
<p>This conception of the teaching art in terms of master and apprentice
shared in the idea and origin of the university. As the masters
multiplied, they naturally formed a guild. The word universitas had for
centuries been applied to any collectivity, including guilds. In 1214
Matthew Paris de- scribed a “fellowship of the elect masters” at Paris
as an institution of long standing. We may assume, but cannot prove,
that the “university” took form toward 1170, rather as a guild of
teachers than as a union of faculties. About 1 2 10 a bull of Innocent
III — himself a graduate of Paris — recognized and ap- proved the
written statutes of this teachers’ guild; and another bull of the same
Pope empowered the guild to choose a proctor to represent it at the
papal court.</p>
<p>By the middle of the thirteenth century the Parisian masters were
divided into four faculties or powers: theology, canon law, medicine,
and “arts.” In contrast with Bologna, civil law had, after 1219, no
place in the University of Paris; the curriculum began with the seven
arts, advanced to philosophy, and culminated in theology. The arts
students (who were called artist ae, art- ists) corresponded to our
“undergraduates.” As they constituted by far the greatest part of the
academic population in Paris, they divided, probably for mutual aid,
sociability, and discipline, into four “nations” according to their
place of birth ( natio ) or origin: “France” (i.e., the narrow realm di
- rectly subject to the French king), Picardy, Normandy, and England.
Stu- dents from southern France, Italy, and Spain were taken into the
French “nation,” students from the Low Countries into “Picardy,”
students from central and eastern Europe into “England.” So many
students came from Germany that that country was delayed in establishing
its own universities until 1347. Each “nation” was governed by a
procurator or proctor, each</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 92 1</p>
<p>faculty by a decanus or dean. The students — and perhaps also the
masters — in the faculty of arts chose a rector as their head; gradually
his functions widened until by 1255 he had become the rector of the
university.</p>
<p>We hear of no special university buildings. Apparently, in the
twelfth century, the lectures were given in the cloisters of Notre Dame,
St. Gene- vieve, St. Victor, or other ecclesiastic structures; but in
the thirteenth cen- tury we find teachers hiring private rooms for their
classes. The masters, who came to be called also professores,
proclaimers, were tonsured clerics, who, before the fifteenth century,
lost their position if they married. Teaching was by lectures, largely
for the reason that not every student could afford to buy all the texts
to be studied, and could not always secure copies from the libraries.
The students sat on pavement or floor, and took many notes. The burden
on their memories was so severe that many mnemonic devices were
contrived, usually in the form of verses pregnant with meaning and
repulsive in form. University regulations forbade the teacher to read
his lecture; he was required to speak extempore; he was even forbidden
to “drawl.” 49 Students graciously warned newcomers not to pay for a
course until they had attended three lectures. William of Conches, in
the twelfth century, complained that teachers gave easy courses to gain
popularity, stu- dents, and fees; and that the elective system by which
each student had a wide choice among teachers and subjects was lowering
the standard of education. 60</p>
<p>The teaching was occasionally enlivened by public disputations among
the masters, advanced students, and distinguished visitors. Usually the
dis- cussion followed a set form, the scholastica disputatio : the
question was stated; a negative answer was given, and was defended by
scriptural and patristic quotations, and by reasoning in the form of
objections; a positive answer followed, ’defended by quotations from the
Bible and the Fathers of the Church, and by reasoned replies to the
objections. This scholastica 1 dis- putatio determined the finished form
of the Scholastic philosophy in St. Thomas Aquinas. In addition to such
formal quaestiones disputatae there were informal discussions called
quodlibeta — 11 whatever you please”— where the disputants took up any
question that might be propounded at the moment. These looser debates
also created a literary form, as in the minor writings of St. Thomas.
Such debates, formal or informal, sharpened the medieval mind, and gave
scope for much freedom of thought and speech; in some men, however, they
tended to promote a cleverness that could prove anything, or a logorrhea
that piled mountains of argument on trivial points.</p>
<p>Most of the students lived in hospicia or guesthouses hired by
organized student groups. Sometimes a hospital would board poor students
at a nom- inal fee; so the Hotel- Dieu, adjoining Notre Dame, set aside
a room for “poor clerks.” In 1180 Jocius of London bought this
apartment, and thereafter shared with the hospital in providing lodging
and meals for eighteen stu-</p>

<p>dents in it. By 1231 this group of students had taken larger
quarters, but they still called themselves the College des dix-huit —
the College of Eighteen. Other hospicia or residence halls were
established by monastic orders, or churches, or philanthropists, with
endowments ( bursae ) or annuities that reduced the cost of living for
the student. In 1257 Robert de Sorbon, chap- lain to St. Louis, endowed
the “House of Sorbonne” for sixteen theological students; additional
benefactions from Louis and others provided more ac- commodations, and
raised the number of scholarships to thirty-six; out of this “house”
grew the College of the Sorbonne.* Further “colleges”— collegia in the
old sense of associations — were founded after 1300; masters came to
live in them, served as tutors, heard recitations, and “read” texts with
the students. In the fifteenth century the masters gave courses in the
residence halls; such courses increased in number, courses given outside
decreased, and the college became a hall of education as well as a
student dwelling place. A similar evolution of the college out of the
hospictum occurred at Oxford, Montpellier, and Toulouse. The university
began as an association of teach- ers dealing with associations of
students, and became an association of facul- ties and colleges.</p>
<p>Among the residence halls at Paris were two designed for student
members or novices of the Dominican or the Franciscan Order. The
Dominicans had from their inception stressed education as a means of
combating heresy; they established their own system of schools, of which
the Dominican studium generate at Cologne was the most renowned; and
they had similar institu- tions at Bologna and Oxford. Many friars
became masters, and taught in the halls of their orders. In 1232
Alexander of Hales, one of the ablest teachers in Paris, joined the
Franciscans, and continued his public courses in their Convent of the
Cordeliers. Year by year the number of friars lecturing at Paris
increased, and their nonmonastic audiences grew. The secular masters
mourned that they were left sitting at their desks “like lonely sparrows

<li>In the sixteenth century the Sorbonne became the theological faculty
of the University; in 1792 it was closed by the Revolution; it was
restored by Napoleon, and is now the seat of public courses in science
and letters at the University of Paris.</li>

<p>CHAP. XXXIv) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 923</p>
<p>reorganized masters admitted the monastic masters, who pledged full
obedi- ence to “university” statutes thereafter; but the faculty of arts
permanently excluded all monks from membership. The University of Paris,
once a fa- vorite of the popes, became hostile to the papacy, supported
the kings against the pontiffs, and formed in later days the center of
the “Gallican” move - ment that sought to separate the French Church
from Rome.</p>
<p>No educational institution since Aristotle has rivaled the influence
of the University of Paris. For three centuries it drew to itself not
only the largest number of students, but the greatest dynasty of
intellectually distinguished men. Abelard, John of Salisbury, Albertus
Magnus, Siger of Brabant, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon, Duns
Scotus, William of Occam — these are almost the history of philosophy
from 1 100 to 1400. There must have been great teachers at Paris to
produce these greater ones, and an atmosphere of mental exhilaration
that comes only to the peaks of human history. Furthermore, through
those centuries, the University of Paris was a power in both Church and
state. It was an influential organ of opinion; in the fourteenth century
a hotbed of free speculation; in the fifteenth a cita- del of orthodoxy
and conservatism. It cannot be said to have played “no mean role” in the
condemnation of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>Other universities shared in giving France the cultural leadership of
Eu- rope. Orleans had had a school of law as far back as the ninth
century; in the twelfth it rivaled Chartres as a center of classical and
literary studies; in the thirteenth it was second only to Bologna in the
teaching of civil and canon law. Hardly less famous was the school of
law at Angers, which in 1432 became one of the major universities of
France. Toulouse owed its university to its heresies: in 1229 Gregory IX
compelled Count Raymond to pledge himself to pay the salaries of
fourteen professors — in theology, canon law, and the arts — who should
be sent from Paris to Toulouse to combat the Albigensian heresy by their
influence on Aquitanian youth.</p>
<p>The most renowned of the French universities outside of Paris was at
Montpellier. Situated on the Mediterranean halfway between Marseille and
Spain, that city enjoyed a stirring mixture of French, Greek, Spanish,
and Jewish blood and culture, with a sprinkling of Italian merchants,
and some remnants of the Moorish colony that had once held the town.
Commerce was active there. Whether through the influence of Salernian or
Arabic or Jewish medicine, Montpellier, at an unknown date, established
a school of medicine that soon outshone Salerno; schools of law,
theology, and the “arts” were added; and though these colleges were
independent, their propinquity and co-operation earned for Montpellier a
high repute. The university de- clined in the fourteenth century, but
the school of medicine revived in the Renaissance; and in 1537 one
Franjois Rabelais gave there, in Greek, a course of lectures on
Hippocrates.</p>

<p>Oxford, like the equivalently named Bosporus, developed as a cattle
cross- ing; the Thames narrowed and grew shallow at that point; a
fortress was built there in 912, a market formed, and Kings Cnut and
Harold held gemots there long before the University arose. Presumably
there were schools at Oxford in Cnut’s days, but we hear of no cathedral
school. About 1 1 1 7 we find mention of a “master at Oxenford.” In 1133
Robert Pullen, a theolo- gian, came from Paris and lectured at Oxford on
theology. 52 By steps now lost to history, the schools of Oxford became
in the twelfth century a stadium generate or university — “no man can
say when.” 33 In 1209, accord - ing to a contemporary estimate, there
were 3000 students and teachers at Oxford. 34 As at Paris there were
four faculties: arts, theology, medicine, and canon law. In England the
teaching of civil law escaped the universities, and lodged at the Inns
of Co urt in London. Lincoln’s Inn, Gray’s Inn, the Inner and the Middle
Temple were the fourteenth-century descendants of the homes or chambers
in which judges and teachers of the law, in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, received students as apprentices.</p>
<p>At Oxford, as at Paris and Cambridge, the colleges began as endowed
resi- dence halls for poor students. At an early date they became also
lecture halls; masters dwelt in them with the students; and by the end
of the thir- teenth century the aulae or halls had become the physical
and pedagogical constituents of the University. About 1260 Sir John de
Balliol of Scotland (father of the Scotch king of 1292), as penance for
an unknown crime, established at Oxford a “House of Balliol” to
maintain, by a grant of eight pence () a week, certain poor scholars
called socii, “fellows.” Three years later Walter de Merton founded and
endowed the “House of the Scholars of Merton,” first at Malden, soon at
Oxford, to care for as many students as its income could support. These
revenues were repeatedly doubled by the rise of land values, so that
Archbishop Peckham in 1284 complained that the “poor scholars” were
receiving additional allowances for “delicate living.” 55 In general the
English colleges grew wealthy not only by fellow- ship grants and other
gifts, but through the rise in the value of the estates with which they
were endowed. About 1280 a bequest by William of Dur- ham, Archbishop of
Rouen, established University Hall, now University College; the modest
beginnings of these famous colleges is shown in the terms of foundation,
which provided for four masters and such scholars as might care to board
with them. The masters chose one of their number as “senior fellow” to
manage the hall; in ti me he or his successors appropriated those titles
of “master” or “principal” by which the heads of the English colleges
are known today. The University of Oxford in the thirteenth century was
the association of these colleges under a “university” or gui ld of
masters,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIv) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 925</p>
<p>themselves governed by regents and a chancellor of their own
choosing, who in turn was subject to the bishop of Lincoln and the
king.</p>
<p>By 1300 Oxford ranked next to Paris as a center of intellectual
activity and influence. Its most famous graduate was Roger Bacon; other
Franciscan monks, including Adam Marsh, Thomas of York, John Peckham,
formed with him there a distinguished group of learned men. Their leader
and in- spiration, Robert Grosseteste ( 1 1 75? — 1 253 ) , was the
finest figure in the life of Oxford in the thirteenth century. He
studied law, medicine, and natural science there, graduated in 1 179,
took his divinity degree in 1189, and soon afterward was chosen “Master
of the Oxford Schools”— the earlier form of the title of chancellor. In
1235, while still remaining head of Oxford, he be- came Bishop of
Lincoln, and superintended the completion of the great cathedral. He
energetically promoted the study of Greek and of Aristotle, and shared
in the heroic effort of the thirteenth-century mind to reconcile
Aristotle’s philosophy with the Christian faith. He wrote commentaries
on Aristotle’s Physics and Posterior Analytics , summarized the science
of his time in a Compendium Scientiarum, and worked for a reform of the
calen- dar. He understood the principles of the microscope and the
telescope, and opened many paths for Roger Bacon in mathematics and
physics; it was probably he who acquainted Bacon with the magnifying
property of the lens. 50 Many ideas that we ascribe to Bacon — on
perspective, the rainbow, tides, the calendar, the desirability of
experiment — were apparently suggested to him by Grosseteste; above all,
the notion that all science must be based upon mathematics, since all
force, in its passage through space, follows geometrical forms and
rules. 57 He wrote French poetry and a treatise on husbandry, and was a
lawyer and a physician as well as a theologian and a scientist. He
encouraged the study of Hebrew with a view to converting the Jews;
meanwhile he behaved toward them in an anomalously Christian way, and
protected them as well as he could from the sadism of the mob. He was an
active social reformer, always loyal to the Church, but daring to lay
before Pope Innocent IV (1250) a written memorial in which he ascribed
the shortcomings of the Church to the practices of the Papal Curia. 58
At Oxford he established the first “chest” to make gratuitous loans to
schol - ars. 59 He was the first of a thousand brilliant minds whose
achievements cre- ated the magnificent prestige of Oxford in the
educational and intellectual world.</p>
<p>Today Oxford is a manufacturing center as well as a university, and
makes automobiles as well as dons. But Cambridge is still a city of
colleges, a me- dieval jewel brightened with modern wealth and British
good taste; every- thing in it pertains to its colleges, and the
medieval peace of mind survives in this loveliest of university towns.
Apparently its intellectual eminence must be dated from a murder at
Oxford. In 1209 a woman was killed there by a student; the townspeople
raided a residence hall, and hanged two or</p>
<p>926 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>three students. The university — i.e., the association of masters —
suspended operations in protest against the action of the townsfolk;
and, if we may believe the usually trustworthy Matthew Paris, 3000
students, and presum- ably many masters, left Oxford. A large number of
them, we are told, went to Cambridge and set up halls and faculties;
this is the first mention we have of anything higher there than an
elementary school. A second migration — of Parisian students in 1228 —
swelled the ranks of the student body. Monks mendicant or Benedictine
came and established colleges. In 1281 the Bishop of Ely organized the
first secular college in Cambridge — St. Peter’s College, now
Peterhouse. The fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries saw the
foundation and embellishment of additional colleges, some of them among
the masterpieces of medieval architecture. All of them together,
embraced by the quiet winding Cam, constitute with their campuses one of
the fairest works of man.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>STUDENT LIFE</li>
</ol>
<p>The medieval student might be of any age. He might be a curate, a
prior, an abbot, a merchant, a married man; he might be a lad of
thirteen, troubled with the sudden dignity of his years. He went to
Bologna, Orleans, or Mont- pellier to become a lawyer or a physician; to
other universities he went in some cases to prepare for governmental
service, usually to make a career in the Church. He encountered no
entrance examinations; the only require- ments were a knowledge of
Latin, and ability to pay a modest fee to each master whose course he
took. If he was poor he might be helped by a scholarship, or by his
village, his friends, his church, or his bishop. There were thousands of
such cases. 00 Abbot Samson, hero of Jocelyn’s Chronicle and Carlyle’s
Past and Present, owed his education to a poor priest who sold holy
water to keep Samson in fees. 01 A student traveling to or from a uni-
versity usually received free transportation, and free food and lodging
at monasteries on the way. 02</p>
<p>Arriving at Oxford, Paris, or Bologna, he would find himself one of a
large crowd of happy, embarrassed, and eager students riding on a wave
of intel- lectual enthusiasm that made philosophy — with a dash of
heresy — as exciting as war, and a debate as fascinating as a
tournament. At Paris he would have found, in 1300, some 7000 students,
at Bologna 6000, at Oxford 3000;* in general the universities of Paris,
Oxford, and Bologna had more students in</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the conservative estimates of Rashdall. 63 The jurist
Odofredus, writing about 1250, reckoned the students in Bologna in 1200
at 10,000. Rabanus Gauma, a Nestorian monk, put the number of students
at Paris in 1287 at 30,000. Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh, calcu -
lated, about 1360, that there had once been 30,000 students at Oxford;
about 1380 Wyclif doubled this estimate; in 1450 Bishop Gascoigne, who
had been Chancellor of Oxford, re- turned to 3o,ooo. 64 These estimates
are evidently guesswork and exaggeration; but we cannot prove them
false.</li>

<p>the thirteenth century than later, probably because they had less
competi- tion. The newcomer would be received by his “nation,” and might
be guided into living quarters — perhaps with some poor family; if he
had the right con- nections he might get a bed and share a room in one
of the hospicia or resi- dence halls, where his expenses would be light.
In 1374 a student at Oxford paid 104 shillings (040) a year for bed and
board, twenty (00) for tuition, forty for clothes. 65</p>
<p>No specific academic dress was enjoined upon him; however, he was re-
quested to button his robe and not go shoeless unless his robe reached
to his heels. 66 For distinction masters wore a cappa — a red or purple
cope with miniver border and hood; sometimes they covered the head with
a square biretta, topped with a tuft instead of a tassel. The student at
Paris had the status and ecclesiastical immunities of a cleric: he was
exempt from military service, state taxation, or secular trial; he was
expected — not always com- pelled — to take the tonsure; if he married
he could continue as a student, but he lost his clerical privileges, and
could not take a degree. A judicious prom- iscuity, however, involved no
such penalties. The monk Jacques de Vitry, about 1230, described the
Parisian students as</p>
<p>more dissolute than the people. They counted fornication no sin.
Pros- titutes dragged passing clerics to brothels almost by force, and
openly through the streets; if the clerics refused to enter, the whores
called</p>
<p>them sodomites That abominable vice 〔sodomy〕 so filled the city</p>
<p>that it was held a sign of honor if a man kept one or more
concubines.</p>
<p>In one and the same house there were classrooms above and a brothel
beneath; upstairs masters lectured, downstairs courtesans carried on
their base services; in the same house the debates of philosophers could
be heard with the quarrels of courtesans and pimps. 67</p>
<p>This has all the earmarks of righteous exaggeration; we may only
conclude that at Paris cleric and saint were not synonyms.* Jacques goes
on to tell how each national group among the students had favorite
adjectives for the other groups: the English were heavy drinkers and had
tails; the French were proud and effeminate; the Germans were furibundi
(blusterers) and “ob - scene in their cups”; the Flemish were fat and
greedy and “soft as butter”;</p>
<ul>
<li>But cf. Rashdall: “There is only too much evidence that de Vitry’s
picture of the scholas - t ic life of his age, if exaggerated, is not
fundamentally untruthful.” 68</li>
</ul>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>928</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>the bell of St. Mary’s summoned the students, and the bell of
St. Martin’s called the burghers, to do battle in an intermittent war
between gown and town. One riot in Oxford (1298) cost £ 3,000 (50,000)
in damage to property. 70 A Paris official (1269) issued a proclamation
against scholars who “by day and night atrociously wound and slay many,
carry off women, ravish virgins, brea k into houses,” and commit “over
and over again robberies and many other enormities.” 71 Oxford boys may
have been less given to lechery than the pupils of Paris, but homicides
were frequent there, and executions were rare. If the murderer left town
he was seldom pursued; and an Oxford man considered it sufficient
punishment for an Oxford murderer to be compelled to go to Cambridge.
72</p>
<p>As water was hardly safe to drink, and neither tea nor coffee nor
tobacco had yet reached Europe, the students reconciled themselves with
wine and beer to Aristotle and heatless rooms. One of the main reasons
for organizing a “university” of students was to celebrate religious or
academic festivals with conspicuously virile drinking. Every step in the
scholastic year was a “jocund advent” to be graced with wine. Students
in many cases provided such refreshments for their examiners; and the
“nations” usually consumed in the taverns whatever remained in their
treasuries at the end of the scho- lastic year. Dicing was an added
solace; some students earned excommuni- cation by playing dice on the
altars of Notre Dame. 73 In their more orderly moments the students
amused themselves with dogs, hawks, music, dancing, chess, telling
stories, and hazing newcomers. Such fledglings were styled bejauni —
yellow-bills; they were bullied and hoaxed, and were made to pro- vide a
feast for their lords of a year’s advantage. Discipline relied largely
on rules established by each hall of residence; violations were punished
with fines or by “sconces”— whereby an offending student was mulcted in
gallons of wine, to be corporately consumed. Flogging, though frequent
in gram- mar schools, is not mentioned in university discipline till the
fifteenth cen- tury. For the rest the university authorities required
every student at the beginning of each year to take a solemn oath to
obey all regulations. Among the required oaths at Paris was one pledging
the student not to take vengeance on examiners who failed to pass him.
74 The students swore in haste and sinned at leisure. Perjury was
prevalent; hell had no terrors for young theologians.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the students found time for lectures. There were
sluggards among them; some who preferred leisure to fame favored the
courses in canon law, whose sessions began at the third hour and allowed
them to com- plete their sleep. 75 As the third hour was nine a.m., it
is apparent that most classes met soon after dawn, probably at seven. At
the beginning of the thir- teenth century the school season lasted
eleven months; by the end of the fourteenth century the “long vacation,”
originating in the need for youthful hands at harvest time, ran from
June 28 to August 25 or September 15. At</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV) TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE 929</p>
<p>Oxford and Paris only a few days were left free at Christmas and
Easter; at Bologna, whose students were of greater age and means, and
perhaps more distant provenance, ten days were allowed at Christmas,
fourteen at Easter, twenty-one for the carnival preceding Lent.</p>
<p>There were seemingly no examinations during the scholastic course.
There were recitations and disputations, and incompetent students might
be weeded out en route. Toward the middle of the thirteenth century the
cus- tom arose of requiring the student, after five years of resident
study, to pass a preliminary examination by a committee of his nation.
This involved first a private test — a responsio to questions; second, a
public disputation in which the candidate defended one or more theses
against challengers, and con- cluded with a summation of the results (
determinatio ) . Those who passed these preliminary trials were called
baccalarii, bachelors, and were allowed to serve a master as assistant
teacher or “cursory” lecturer. The bachelor might continue his resident
studies for three years more; then, if his master thought him fit for
the ordeal, he was presented to examiners appointed by the chancellor.
Masters were expected not to present clearly unprepared candidates
unless these were rich in money or dignity; in such cases the pub- lic
examination was adjusted to the candidate’s capacity, or it might be dis
- pensed with altogether. 76 Qualities of character were included as
subjects for examination; moral offenses committed during his four or
seven years at the university might then block the candidate’s access to
a degree, for the degree attested moral fitness as well as intellectual
preparation. Of seventeen failures at the examination of forty-three
candidates in Vienna in 1449, all were for moral, none for intellectual,
deficiency.</p>
<p>If the student passed this public and final examination he became a
master or “doctor,” and automatically received an ecclesiastically
sanctioned li - cense to teach anywhere in Christendom. As a bachelor he
had taught with uncovered head; now he was crowned with a biretta,
received a kiss and a blessing from his master, and, seated in the
magisterial chair, gave an in- augural lecture or held an inaugural
disputation; this was his inceptio — called at Cambridge his
“commencement” as a master. It was essential to such graduation that he
should entertain all or a large number of the masters of the university
at a banquet, and make presents to them. By these and other ceremonies
he was received into the magisterial guild.</p>
<p>It is comforting to observe that medieval education had defects as
trouble- some as the educational systems of today. Only a small
proportion of matric- ulants survived the five years required for the
baccalaureate. The assumption of all the defined doctrines of the Church
as binding on belief put the mind to rest instead of to work. The search
for arguments to prove these beliefs, the citing of scriptural or
patristic support for them, the interpretation of Aristotle to harmonize
with them, trained intellectual subtlety rather than</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>930</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>intellectual conscience. We may forgive these faults more readily if
we con- sider that any way of life develops a similar dogmatism about
the assumptions on which it rests. So today we leave men free to
question the religious, but not the political, faith of their fathers;
and political heresy is punished by social ostracism as theological
heresy was punished by excommunication in the Age of Faith; now that the
policeman labors to take the place of God, it becomes more dangerous to
question the state than to doubt the Church. No system smiles upon the
challenging of its axioms.</p>
<p>The transmission of knowledge and the training of appreciation are
obvi- ously more widespread, and seem more abundant, than in the Middle
Ages; but we should not readily say the same for the education of
character. Prac- tical ability was not lacking in the medieval graduate;
the universities sent forth a considerable number of able
administrators, lawyers who made the French monarchy, philosophers who
led Christianity out upon the high seas of reason, popes who dared to
think in European terms. The universities sharpened the intellect of
Western man, created a language for philosophy, made learning
respectable, and ended the mental adolescence of the trium- phant
barbarians.</p>
<p>While so many other achievements of the Middle Ages crumble before
the juggernaut of time, the universities, bequeathed to us by the Age of
Faith in all the elements of their organization, adjust themselves to
inescapable change, moult their old skins to live new lives, and wait
for us to wed them to government.</p>
