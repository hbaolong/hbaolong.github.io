<p>XXEnglish Philosophy</p>
<p>1648-1715</p>
<p>I. THOMAS HOBBES: 1 5 88-1 679</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Formative Influences</li>
</ol>
<p>H E WAS born aforetime on April 5, 1588; his mother attributed
his</p>
<p>premature birth to her fright at the coming of the Spanish Armada</p>
<p>and the threat of a large-scale invasion by murderous idolaters. To
this unpremeditated expulsion into life the philosopher ascribed his
timorous disposition, but he was the boldest heretic of his age. His
father, an</p>
<p>Anglican clergyman at Malmesbury in Wiltshire, may have transmitted
some pugnacity to the son, for he engaged in a brawl at the door of his
church and then disappeared, leaving his three children to be brought up
by a brother.</p>
<p>The brother prospered, and at fifteen Thomas entered Magdalen Col-
lege, Oxford, doubtless as timid as any youth venturing into caves dedi-
cated to the idols of the tribe. He found little to his liking in the
philosophy taught there; he consoled himself with extracurricular
reading, and gained a firsthand acquaintance with Greek and Latin
classics. Graduating at twenty, he had the good fortune to be employed
as private tutor to William Cavendish, who became second Earl of
Devonshire; the protection given him by that family proved precious to
him in the days of his heresies. With his pupil he traveled on the
Continent (1610). On his return he served for a while as secretary to
Francis Bacon; that stimulating ex- perience may have shared in forming
his thoroughly empirical philosophy. About this time, Aubrey tells us,
“Mr. Benjamin Johnson, Poet Laureate,</p>
<p>His discovery of Euclid was a turning point in his mental
biography.</p>
<p>He was forty years old when, in a private library, he saw the
Elements</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>open at Proposition XL VII of Book I. Reading it, he cried out, “By
God, this is impossible!” The demonstration referred for its proof to an
earlier proposition, and this to another, and so backward to the initial
definitions and axioms. He was delighted with this logical architecture,
and fell in love with geomet ry. 2 But, Aubrey adds, he “was much
addicted to music, and practiced on the bass viol.” In 1629 he published
a translation of Thucydides, with the professed aim of scaring England
away from democ- racy. In that year he resumed his travels, now as tutor
to his first pupil’s son, the third Earl of Devonshire. His visit to
Galileo (1636) may have strengthened his inclination to interpret the
universe in mechanical terms. He returned to England in 1637. As the
conflict between Parliament and Charles I progressed, Hobbes wrote an
essay, The Elements of Law, Natural and Politique, defending the
absolute authority of the King as indispensable to social order and
national unity. This was circulated in manuscript, and might have led to
the a uthor’s arrest had not Charles dis - solved the Parliament. As the
temper of the conflict rose, Hobbes thought it discreet to retire to the
Continent (1640). He remained there, chiefly in Paris, for the next
eleven years. In Paris he won the friendship of Mersenne and Gassendi,
and the hostility of Descartes. Mersenne invited him to sub- mit
comments on Descartes’ Meditations; he did, with some courtesy but too
much point, and Descartes never forgave him. When civil war came to
England (1642), Royalist emigres formed a colony in France, and</p>
<p>Hobbes may have taken from them some added rubbing of monarchist
sentiment. For two years (1646-48) he was tutor in mathematics to the
exiled Prince of Wales, the future Charles II. The outbreak of the
Fronde in France — aiming, like the revolt in England, to limit royal
power — con- firmed his conviction that only an absolute monarchy could
maintain stability and internal peace.</p>
<p>He arrived very slowly at the definitive expression of his
philosophy. “He walked much and contemplated,” says Aubrey, “and he had
in the head of his staff 〔cane〕 a pen and inkhorn, carried always a
notebook in his pocket, and as soon as a notion darted, he presently
entered it into his book, or else he should perhaps have lost it .” 3 He
issued a series of minor works,* most of which are now negligible; but
in 1651 he gathered his thoughts into a reckless masterpiece of thought
and style: The Leviathan, or The Matter, Form, and Power of a
Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil. This is one of the landmarks in
the history of philosophy; we must tarry with it leisurely.</p>

verse (1679).</p>
<p>55 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XX2. Logic and Psychology</p>
<p>The style is almost as good as Bacon’s: not as rich in illuminating
images, but every bit as pithy, idiomatic, forceful, and direct, with
now and then a tang of pointed irony. There is no ornament here, no show
of eloquence, only the clear expression of clear thought with a stoic
economy of verbal means. “Words,” said Hobbes, “are wise men’s counters,
they do but reckon by them; but they are the money of fools that value
them by the authority of an Aristotle, a Cicero, or a Thomas .” 4 With
that new razor he cut down many a weed of pretentious and meaningless
speech. When he came upon St. Thomas Aquinas’ definition of eternity as
nunc stans, or “everlasting now,” he shrugged it off as “easy enough to
say, but though I fain would, yet I never could conceive it; they that
can are happier than I.” Therefore Hobbes is a blunt nominalist: class
or abstract nouns like man or virtue are merely names for generalizing
ideas; they do not repre- sent objects; all objects are individual
entities — individual virtuous actions, individual men . . .</p>
<p>He defines his terms carefully, and on the first page of his book
he</p>
<p>defines “Leviathan” as “a commonwealth or state.” He found the word
in Job (xli), where God used it for an unspecified sea monster as an
image of the divine power. Hobbes proposed to make the state a great
organism that should absorb and direct all human activity. But before
coming to his main thesis he swept through logic and psychology with a
merciless hand.</p>
<p>He understood by philosophy what we should now call science: “the
knowledge of effects, or of appearances, acquired from the knowledge . .
. of their causes, and, conversely, of possible causes from their known
ef fects .” 5 He followed Bacon in expecting from such a study great
practi - cal benefits to human life. But he ignored Bacon’s call to
inductive reason - ing; he was all for “true ratiocination,” i.e.,
deduction from experience;</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>551</p>
<p>has been; if this shall be, that shall be; which is to know
conditionally .” 6</p>
<p>As that passage foresaw Hume’s argument that w e know only sequences,
not causes, so Hobbes anticipated Locke’s sensationist psychology. All
knowledge begins with sensation. “There is no conception in a man’s mind
which hath not at first, totally or by parts, been begotten upon the
organs of sense .” 7 It is a frankly materialistic psychology: nothing
exists, outside us or within us, except matter and motion. “All
qualities called sensible,” or sensory (light, color, form, hardness,
softness, sound, odor, taste, heat, cold), “are, in the object that
causeth them, but so many several motions of the matter, by which it
presseth our organs diversely. Neither, in us that are pressed, are they
anything else but divers motions, for motion produceth nothing but
motion .” 8 Motion in the form of change is neces- sary to sensation;
“semper idem sentire idem est ac nihil sentire” (Hobbes could be
epigrammatic in Latin too) — always to feel the same thing is the same
as to feel nothing . 9 (So neither the white man nor the colored man is
conscious of his own odor, since it is always under his nose.)</p>
<p>From sensation Hobbes proceeds to derive imagination and memory
through a peculiar application of what came to be Newton’s first law of
motion:</p>
<p>That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will
lie</p>
<p>still forever, is a truth that no man doubts of. But that when a
thing</p>
<p>is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay
it, though the reason be the same (namely, that nothing can change
itself), is not so easily assented to. . . .</p>
<p>When a body is once in motion it moveth (unless something else</p>
<p>hinder it) eternally; and whatsoever hindreth it cannot in an
instant, but 〔only〕 in time and by degrees, quite extinguish it. And
as we see in the water, though the wind cease, the waves give not over
rolling for a long time after; so also it happeneth in that motion which
is</p>
<p>made in the internal parts of a man, then when he sees, dreams,
etc.</p>
<p>For after the object is removed, or the eye shut, we still retain
an</p>
<p>image of the things seen, though more obscure than when we see
it.</p>
<p>And this is it the Latins call Imagination. . . . Imagination,
therefore,</p>
<p>is nothing but decaying sense. . . . When we would express the decay,
and signifying that the sense is fading, old, and past, it is called
Mem- ory. . . . Much Memory, or memory of many things, is called Ex-</p>
<p>perience . 10</p>
<p>Ideas are imaginations produced by sensation or memory. Thought is a
sequence of such imaginations. That sequence is determined not by a free
will but by mechanical laws governing the association of ideas.</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXNot every thought to every thought succeeds indifferently. But
as</p>
<p>we have no imagination whereof we have not formerly had sense</p>
<p>in whole or in parts, so we have no transition from one
imagination</p>
<p>to another whereof we never had the like before in our senses. The
reason whereof is this: All fancies 〔imaginations, ideas〕 are
motions</p>
<p>within us, relics of those made in the sense; and those motions that
immediately succeeded one another in the sense, continue also to-</p>
<p>gether after sense. . . . But because in sense, to one and the
same</p>
<p>thing perceived, sometimes one thing, sometimes another, succeeds, it
comes to pass in time that, in the imaging of anything, there is no cer-
tainty what we shall imagine next; only this is certain, it shall be</p>
<p>something that succeeded the same before, at one time or another . 11
Such a train of tho ughts may be unguided, as in dreams, or
“regulated</p>
<p>There is no place in Hobbes’s psychology for free will. The will
itself</p>
<p>is no separate faculty or entity, but merely the last desire or
aversion in the process of deliberation; and deliberation is an
alternation of desires or aversions, which ends when one impulse lasts
long enough to flow into action. “In deliberation the last appetite or
aversion immediately adhering to the action or the omission th ereof is
that we call the will .” 14 “Appetite, fear, hope, or the rest of the
passions are not called voluntary, for they proceed not from, but are,
the will, and the will is not voluntary .” 15 “Be - cause every act of
man’s will, and every desire and inclination, proceedeth - out the
universe there is an unbroken chain of causes and effects. Nothing is
contingent or miraculous or due to chance.</p>
<p>The world is a machine of matter in motion according to law, and man
himself is a similar machine. Sensations enter him as motions, and beget
images or ideas; each idea is the beginning of a motion, and becomes
an</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>action if not impeded by another idea . 17 Every idea, however
abstract, moves the body in some degree, however unseen. The nervous
system is a mechanism for transforming sensory motion into muscular
motion. Spirits exist, but they are merely subtle forms of matter . 18
The soul and the mind are not immaterial; they are names for the vital
processes of the body and operations of the brain. Hobbes makes no
attempt to explain why con- sciousness should have developed in such a
mechanical process of sensation- to-idea-to-response. And by reducing
all perceived qualities of objects to images in the “mind,” he comes
close to the position that Berkeley would later take in refuting
materialism — that all reality known to us is percep- tion, mind.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Ethics and Politics</li>
</ol>
<p>Like Descartes before him and Spinoza after him, Hobbes undertakes an
analysis of the passions, for he finds in them the sources of all human
actions. All three philosophers use the word passion broadly to mean any
basic instinct, feeling, or emotion — chiefly appetite (or desire) and
aver- sion, love and hate, delight and fear. Behind all these are
pleasure and pain — physiological processes raising or lowering the
vitality of the organism. Appetite is the beginning of a motion toward
something that promises pleasure; love is such an appetite directed to
one person. All impulses (as La Rochefoucauld would argue fourteen years
later) are forms of self-love, and derive from the instinct of
self-preservation. Pity is the imagination of future calamity to
ourselves, aroused by perceiving another’s calamity; charity is the
satisfied feeling of power in helping others. Gratitude some- times
includes a certain hostil ity. “To have received from one, to whom we
think ourselves equal, greater benefits than there is hope to requite,
dis- poseth to counterfeit love but really secret hatred, and puts a man
into the estate of a desperate debtor, that, in declining the sight of
his creditor, tacitly wishes him there where he might never see him
more. For benefits oblige, and obligation is thralldom .” 19 The basic
aversion is fear, the basic appetite is for power. “I put for a general
inclination of all mankind a perpetual and restless desire of power
after power, that ceaseth only in death .” 20 We desire riches and
knowledge as means to power, and honors as evidence of power; and we
desire power because we fear insecurity. Laughter is an expression of
superiority and power.</p>
<p>The passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory 〔self-</p>
<p>satisfaction〕 arising from a sudden conception of some eminency in
ourselves by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXown formerly; for men laugh at the follies of themselves past, when
these come suddenly to remembrance, except they bring with them any
present dishonor. . . . Laughter is incident most to them that are
conscious of the fewest abilities in themselves, who are forced to</p>
<p>keep themselves in their own favor by observing the imperfections</p>
<p>of other men. And therefore much laughter at the defects of others is
a sign of pusillanimity. For of great minds one of the proper works is
to help and free others from scorn, and compare themselves only with the
most able . 21</p>
<p>Good and bad are subjective terms, varying in content not only from
place to place and from time to time, but from person to person. “The
object of any appetite or desire … a man calleth the good; the object of
his hate or aversion, evil; for these words … are ever used with
relation to the person that useth them, there being nothing simply and
absolutely so, nor any common rule of good and evil to be taken from the
nature of the objects themselves .” 22 Strength of passions may be good,
and lead to great - ness. “He who has no great passion for . . . power,
riches, knowledge, or honor . . . cannot possibly have a great fancy or
much judgment.” To have weak passions is dullness; to have passions
abnormally strong is madness; “to have no desires is to be dead .”
23</p>
<p>The felicity of this life consisteth not in the repose of a mind
satis-</p>
<p>fied. For there is no such finis ultimas (utmost aim) nor sunrmum</p>
<p>bonum (greatest good) as is spoken of in the books of the old moral
philosophers. . . . Felicity is a continual progress of the desire,
from</p>
<p>one object to another, the obtaining of the former being still but
the way to the latter . 24</p>
<p>The government of men so constituted, so acquisitive and competitive,
so hot with passions and prone to strife, is the most complex and
arduous of all human tasks, and to those who undertake it we must allow
every weapon of psychology and power. Though the human will is not free,
society is justified in encouraging certain actions by calling them
virtuous and rewarding them, and in discouraging some actions by calling
them wicked and punishing them. There is no contradiction here with
deter- minism: these social approvals and condemnations are added, for
the good of the group, to the motives influencing conduct. “The world is
governed by opinion”; 25 government, religion, and the moral code are in
large part the manipulation of opinion to reduce the necessity and area
of force.</p>
<p>Government is necessary, not because man is naturally bad — for “the
desires and other passions . . . are in themselves no sin” 26 — but
because man is by nature more individualistic than social. Hobbes did
not agree with Aristotle that man is “a political animal” — i.e., a
being equipped by nature</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>for society. On the contrary, he conceived an original “state of
nature” (and therefore the original nature of man) as a condition of
competition and mutual aggression checked only by fear, not yet by law.
We can visualize that hypothetical condition (said Hobbes) by observing
inter- national relations in our own age: nations are still for the most
part in “a state of n ature,” not yet subject to a superimposed law or
power.</p>
<p>In all times kings and persons of sovereign authority, because of</p>
<p>their independency, are in continual jealousies, and in the state and
posture of gladiators; having their weapons pointed, and their eyes</p>
<p>fixed, on one another — that is, their forts, garrisons, and guns on
the frontiers of their kingdoms — and continual spies upon their
neighbors; which is a posture of war. . . . Where there is no common
power</p>
<p>there is no law, no injustice. Force and fraud are in war the
cardinal virtues. 27</p>
<p>So, Hobbes believed, individuals and families, before the coming of
social organization, had lived in a condition of perpetual war, actual
or potential, “every man against every man.” 28 “War consisteth not in
battle only, . . . but in a tract of time wherein the will to contend by
battle is sufficiently shown.” 29 He rejected the theory of Roman
jurists and Christian philoso - phers that there is, or ever was, a “law
of nature” in the sense of laws of right and wrong based upon the nature
of man as a “reasonable animal”; he admitted that man was occasionally
rational, but saw him rather as a creature of passions — above all, the
will to power — using reason as a tool of desire, and controlled only by
fear of force. Primitive life — i.e., life before social organization —
was lawless, violent, fearful, “nasty, brutish, and short.” 30</p>
<p>From this hypothetical “state of nature,” men, in Hobbes’s vision,
had emerged by an implicit agreement one with another to submit to a
common power. This is the “social - contract” theory made popular by
Rousseau’s treatise under that title (1762), but already old and
battered in Hobbes’s day. Milton, in his tract On the Tenure of Kings
and Magistrates (1649), had just interpreted the contract as an
agreement between a king and his subjects — that they would obey him,
and that he would properly fulfill the duties of his office; if he
failed in this, said Milton (like Buchanan, Mar- iana, and many others),
the people would be justified in deposing him. Hobbes objected to this
form of the theory on the ground that it established no authority
empowered to enforce the contract, or to determine when it had been
broken. He preferred to think of the social compact as made not between
ruler and ruled, but among the ruled, who agreed</p>
<p>to confer all their power and strength 〔their right to the use of
force upon one another〕 upon one man, or upon one assembly of men. . .
.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXThis done, the multitude so united in one person is called a
common- wealth. This is the generation of the great leviathan, or
rather</p>
<p>… of that Mortal God to which we owe, under the Immortal God ,</p>
<p>our peace and defense. For by this authority, given him by every . .
. man in the Commonwealth, he hath the use of so much power and</p>
<p>strength conferred on him, that by terror thereof he is enabled
to</p>
<p>form the wills of them all … to the end he may use the strength</p>
<p>and means of them all, as he shall think expedient, for their peace
and common defense. And he that carryeth this Person is called
Sovereign, and said to have Sovereign Power; and every one besides, his
Sub-</p>

<p>The theory rashly assumed, among the “nasty and brutish” savages</p>
<p>aforementioned, a degree of order, rationality and humility
sufficient for an agreement to surrender their powers. Hobbes wisely
allowed for alter- native origins of the state:</p>
<p>The attaining to this Sovereign Power is by two ways. One, by</p>
<p>natural force, as when a man . . . maketh his children to submit
them- selves, and their children, to his government, as being able to
destroy them if they refuse; or by war subdueth his enemies to his will.
. . .</p>
<p>The other is when men agree among themselves to submit to some man,
or assembly of men, voluntarily, on confidence to be protected by him
against all others. This latter may be called a Political Com-</p>
<p>monwealth . 32</p>
<p>However based, the sovereign, to be really sovereign, must have
absolute power, for without it he cannot ensure individual security and
public peace. To resist him is to violate the social contract which
every person in the community has implicitly agreed to by accepting the
protection of its head. The theoretical absolutism may admit of some
actual limitations: a sovereign may be resisted if he orders a man to
kill or maim himself, or to confess a crime, or if the ruler is no
longer able to protect his subjects. “The obligation of subjects to the
Sovereign is understood to last as long and no longer than the power
lasteth by which he is able to protect them.” Revolution is always a
crime until it succeeds. It is always unlawful and unjust, for both law
and justice are determined by the Sovereign; but if a revolution
establishes a stable and effective government, the subject is bound to
obey the new power.</p>
<p>The king does not rule by divine right, since his power is derived
from the people; but his authority must not be limited by a popular
assembly, or by law, or by the Church. It should extend also to
property; the sovereign should determine property rights, and may
reappropriate private property for what he deems the public good . 34
Absolutism is necessary, for when</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>power is shared, as between king and parliament, there will soon be
con- flict, then civil war, then chaos, then insecurity of life and
property; and since security and peace are the ultimate needs of a
society, there should be no separation, but full unity and
concentration, of governmental powers. Where powers are divided there is
no sovereign, and where there is no sovereign there will soon be no
state . 36</p>
<p>Consequently the only logical form of government is monarchy. It</p>
<p>should be hereditary, for the right to choose his successor is part
of the sovereign’s sovereignty; again the alternative is anarchy . 36
Government by an assembly might serve, but only on condition that its
power be absolute, not subject to the shifting desires of an uninformed
populace. “A democ - racy is no more than an ar istocracy of orators .”
37 The people are so readily moved by demagogues that control must be
exercised by the government over speech and press; there should be
strict censorship of the publication, importation, and reading of books
. 38 There is to be no nonsense about individual liberty, private
judgment, or conscience; anything that threatens the sovereign
authority, and therefore the public peace, should be contra- cepted at
the source . 39 How could a state be governed, or protected in its
foreign relations, if every individual remained free to obey or not to
obey the law according to his private opinion?</p>
<p>4 . Religion and the State</p>
<p>The sovereign must also control the religion of his people, for this,
when taken to heart, can be a disruptively explosive force. Hobbes
offers a sum- mary definition: “Fear of power invisible, feigned by the
mind, or imagined from tales publicly allowed 〔is〕 Religion; not
allowed, Superstition .” 40 This reduces religion to fear, imagination,
and pretense; but elsewhere Hobbes ascribes it to an anxious inquiry
into the causes and beginnings of things and events . 41 Ultimately this
pursuit of causes leads to the belief that “there must be (as even the
heathen philosophers confessed) one First Mover, i.e., a First and an
eternal cause of all things; which is that which men mean by the name of
God .” 42 Men naturally supposed that this First Cause was like
themselves, a person, soul, and will, only much more power- ful. They
attributed to this Cause all events whose natural determinants they
could not yet discern, and they saw, in strange events, portents and
prophecies of the divine will.</p>
<p>In these four things, opinion of ghosts 〔spirits〕, ignorance of
second</p>
<p>causes, devotion towards what men fear, and taking of things casual
for prognostications, consisteth the natural seed of religion, which,
by</p>
<p>55 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXreason of different fancies, judgments, and passions of several
men, hath grown up into ceremonies so different, that those which
are</p>
<p>used by one man are for the most part ridiculous to another . 43</p>
<p>Hobbes was a deist rather than an atheist. He acknowledged an
intelli- gent Supreme Being , 44 but added, “Men . . . may naturally
know that God is, though not what he is .” 45 We must not conceive of
God as having figure, for all figure is finite; or as having parts; or
as being in this or that place, “for whatsoever is in place is bounded
and finite”; nor that he moves or rests, for these ascribe to him place;
nor (except by metaphor) that he par- takes of grief, repentance, anger,
mercy, want, appetite, hope, or any desire . 46 Hobbes concluded that
“the nature of God is incomprehensible .” 47 He would not describe God
as incorporeal, for we cannot conceive any- thing to be without body;
probably every “spirit” is subtly corporeal . 48</p>
<p>Having’put religion and God in their place, Hobbes proposed to make
use of them as instruments and servants of government. For this he
claimed prestigious precedents.</p>
<p>The first founders and legislators of commonwealth* amongst the</p>
<p>Gentiles, whose ends were only to keep the people in obedience and
peace, have in all places taken care: First, to imprint in their
minds</p>
<p>a belief that those precepts which they gave concerning religion
might not be thought to proceed from their own device, but from the
dic-</p>
<p>tates of some God, or other Spirit; or else that they themselves were
of a higher nature than mere mortals, that their laws might be more
easily received: So Numa Pompilius pretended to receive the cere-</p>
<p>monies he instituted among the Romans from the nymph Egeria; and the
first king and founder of the Kingdom of Peru pretended himself and his
wife to be the children of the sun; and Mahomet, to set up his new
religion, pretended to have conferences with the Holy Ghost</p>
<p>in the form of a dove. Secondly, they have had a care to make it be-
lieved that the same things were displeasing to the gods, which were
forbidden by the laws . 49</p>
<p>Lest anyone conclude that Moses used similar devices in ascribing his
laws to God, Hobbes adds, with a certain allergy to fire, that “God
himself, by supernatural revelation, planted religion” among the
Jews.</p>
<p>But he feels himself justified, by historical examples, in
recommending that religion be made an instrument of government, and
that, in conse- quence, its doctrines and observances be dictated by the
sovereign. If the Church were independent of the state there would be
two sovereigns, there- fore no sovereign; and subjects would be tom
between two masters.</p>

<p>In such a conflict the Church will have an advantage, “for every man,
if he be in his wits, will in all things yield that man an absolute
obedience, by virtue of whose sentence he believes himself to be either
saved or damned.” When the spiritual power moves the subjects “by the
terror of punishment and hope of reward” of this supernatural sort, “and
by strange and hard words suffocates their understanding, it must needs
thereby distract the people, and either overwhelm the commonwealth by
oppression, or cast it into the fire of civil war .” 31 The only escape
from such turmoil, Hobbes thinks, is to make the Church subject to the
state. As the Catholic Church had the opposite solution, Hobbes, in Part
IV of The Leviathan, attacks it as the ultimate and most powerful foe of
his philosophy.</p>
<p>He enters upon some “Higher Criticism” of the Bible — questions
Moses’ authorship of the Pentateuch, and dates the historical books much
later than in orthodox tradition. He suggests that Christianity should
require of its adherents only a faith in “Jesus the Christ,” and that
for the rest it should allow public opinion to vary within the safe
bounds of public order. To a creed so chastened he offers not only the
support of the government, but the full force of the state to propagate
it. He agrees with the pope that only one religion should be tolerated
in a state . 32 He advises the citizens to accept the theology of their
sovereign without critical hesitation, as a duty to morality and the
state. “For it is with the mysteries of our religion as with wholesome
pills for the sick, which, swallowed whole, have the virtue to cure,
but, chewed, are for the most part cast up again without effect .” 33
The most powerful assault that any Englishman had yet made upon Chris-
tianity ended with Christianity established as the inescapable law of an
absolute state.</p>
<p>5 . Baiting the Bear</p>
<p>“And thus,” said the final paragraph of The Leviathan , “I have brou
ght to an end my Discourse of Civil and Ecclesiastical Government,
occasioned by the disorders of the present time, without partiality . .
. and without other design than to set before men’s eyes the mutual
relation between pro - tection and obedience.”</p>
<p>560</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXThe impartiality was not widely recognized. The emigres who
gathered about Charles II in France welcomed Hobbes’s defense of
royalty, but con - demned his materialism as indiscreet if not
blasphemous, and they regretted that their unmanageable philosopher had
spent reams attacking the Cath- olic Church just when they were
soliciting the aid of a Catholic king. The Anglican divines who were
among the refugees from the triumphant Puri- tans raised such an outcry
against the book that Hobbes “was ordered to come no more to court.” 54
Finding himself now friendless and unprotected</p>
<p>Slowly, as his book found readers, a swarm of critics gathered around
his head. One clergyman after another came to the defense of
Christianity, and asked who was this “Malmesbury animal” who set himself
up against Aristotle, Oxford, Parliament, and God? Hobbes was timid, but
he was a fighter; in 1655 he restated, in The Elements of Philosophy ,
his material- istic and deterministic views. John Bramhall, the learned
bishop of Derry, cast his hook for Hobbes in The Catching of the
Leviathan (1658), and aimed so well, according to another bishop, that
“the hook is still in</p>
<p>Hobbes’s nose.” 57 The attacks continued in almost every year till
Hobbes’s death. The Earl of Clarendon, after his fall from power as
chancellor, amused his exile by publishing A Brief View and Survey of
the Dangerous and Pernicious Errors, in Church and State, in
Mr. Hobbes’s Book entitled Leviathan (1676); through 322 pages it
followed the volumes systemati- cally, answering argument with argument
in lucid and majestic prose. Clar- endon spoke as a man with long
experience in political office, and smiled Hobbes’s philosophy away as
that of one who had had no responsible po sts to temper his theorems
with practice; and he hoped that “Mr. Hobbes</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>5 6 ’</p>
<p>might have a place in Parliament, and sit in Council, and be present
in Courts of Justice and other Tribunals, whereby it is probable he
would find that his solitary cogitations, how deep soever, and his too
peremptory adhering to some Philosophical Notions, and even Rules of
Geometry, have misled him in the investigation of Policy.” 58</p>
<p>Not all the attacks were so even-tempered. In 1 666 the House of Com-
mons ordered one of its committees “to receive information touching such
books as tend to atheism, blasphemy, and profaneness, or against the
essence and attributes of God, and in particular the book published in
the name of White 〔a former Catholic priest who questioned the
immortality of the soul〕, and the book of Hobbes called The Leviathan”
66 “There was a report (and surely true),” says Aubrey, “that in
Parliament . . . some o f the bishops made a motion to have the good old
Gentleman burnt for a heretic.” 60 Hobbes destroyed such of his
unpublished papers as might further embroil him, and wrote three
dialogues arguing learnedly that no court in England could try him for
heresy.</p>
<p>The restored King came to his rescue. Shortly after reaching London,
Charles II noticed Hobbes in the street, recognized him as his former
tutor, and welcomed him to the court. The Restoration court, already
inclined to religious skepticism, and defending royal absolutism against
Parliament, found some congenial elements in Hobbes’s philosophy. But
his bald head, white hair, and Puritanlike garb invited taunting.
Charles himself called him “the Bear,” and, as Hobbes neared, said,
“Here comes th e Bear to be baited.” 61 Nonetheless the witty King
relished Hobbes’s ready repartees.</p>
<p>Aubrey describes him as sickly in youth but healthy and vigorous in
old age. He played tennis till he was seventy-five; when a tennis court
was not av ailable he took a daily walk long and brisk enough to give
him a “great</p>
<p>5&lt;Sz THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhad a shaking palsy in his hands,” which grew so b ad that by 1666
his writ- ing became almost illegible.</p>
<p>He continued to write nevertheless. Reverting from philosophy to
mathe- matics, he slipped incautiously into controversy with an expert,
John Wallis, who made short work of the old man’s claim to square the
circle. In 1670, aged eighty-two, he published Behemoth, a history of
the Civil War; he wrote several replies to his critics, and lovingly
translated The Leviathan into Latin. In 1675 he composed an
autobiography in verse, and rendered all the Iliad and the Odyssey into
English rhymes (1675), because “there is nothing else for me to do.”</p>
<p>In that year, aged eighty-seven, he returned from London to the
country, and he spent the remainder of his life at the Cavendish estate
in Derbyshire. Meanwhile his palsy increased, and he suffered from
strangury — painful difficulty in urination. When the current Earl moved
from Chatsworth to Hardwick Hall, Hobbes insisted on going with him. The
trip proved ex- hausting. A week later his paralysis spread, putting an
end to his speech. On December 4, 1679, having received the Sacrament as
an obedient Anglican, he died, four months short of completing his
ninety-second year.</p>

<p>Hobbes’s psychology was a masterpiece of deduction from inade quate
premises. Logical as it seems at first view, its joints creak with loose
assump- tions that further inquiry might have corrected. Determinism is
logical, but it may be determined by the mold of our logic, formed by
dealing with things rather than ideas. Hobbes found difficulty in
conceiving anything to be incorporeal; it seems equally difficult to
conceive thought or conscious- ness as corporeal; yet these are the only
realities directly known to us — everything else is hypothesis. Hobbes
passed from object to sensation to idea without shedding much light upon
the mysterious process whereby the apparently corporeal object generates
the apparently incorporeal thought. Mechanistic psychology falters in
the face of consciousness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was in psychology that Hobbes contributed most to our
legacy. He cleared the field of some metaphysical ghosts like the
Scholastic “faculties” — though these could be readily interpreted not
as separate men- tal entities but as aspects of mental activity. He
established the more evident principles of association, but
underestimated the role of purpose and atten- tion in determining the
selection, sequence and persistence of ideas. He gave a helpful
description of deliberation and volition. His analysis and defense of
the passions was a brilliant summary, and it paid to Spinoza the debt
that it owed to Descartes. From these psychological pages Locke de-</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>5&lt;&gt;3</p>
<p>veloped his more careful and detailed Essay concerning Human Under-
standing. It was in answering Hobbes (rather than Filmer) that Locke
evolved his treatises on government.</p>
<p>Hobbes’s political philosophy reformulated Machiavelli in term s
of</p>
<p>Charles I. It stemmed from the successful absolutism of Henry VIII
and Elizabeth in England, and of Henry IV and Richelieu in France; and
doubt- less it took some warmth from ducal friends and royal refugees.
In imme- diate effect it seemed justified by the happy restoration of a
Stuart King still claiming unlimited authority, and ending an erosive
anarchy. But some able Englishmen felt that if the consent of “nasty and
brutish” savages sufficed to create a government, the consent of men in
a presumably more advanced condition might rightly check or topple it.
So in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the philosophy of absolutism fell
before the reassertion of Parliament, and was soon replaced by the
liberalism of Locke preaching the limitation and separation of powers.
After a nineteenth century of rela- tive democracy growing in an England
guarded by the Channel and in an America protected by the seas, a
modified absolutism returned in totali- tarian states exercising
governmental control over life, property, industry, religion, education,
publication, and thought. Invention transcended moun- tains and moats,
frontiers vanished, national isolation and security disap- peared. The
absolutist polity is a child of war, and democracy is a luxury of
peace.</p>
<p>We do not know if Hobbes’s “state of nature” ever existed; perhaps so
- cial organization antedated man. The tribe preceded the state, and
custom is older, wider, deeper than law. The family is the biological
ground of an altruism that enlarges the ego and its loyalties; Hobbes’s
ethic might have been kindlier if he had brought up a family. To let the
state define morality (though this too has passed into the totalitarian
regimes) is to destroy one of the forces improving the state. The moral
sense sometimes enlarges its area of co-operation or devotion, and then
prods the law to widen its pro- tection accordingly. In a distant future
it may be possible for a state to be Christian, as was once that of
Ashoka, who was a Buddhist.</p>
<p>Hobbes’s strongest influence was his materialism. From
intellectual</p>
<p>groups “Hobbism” flowed into the professional and business classes;
the irate Bentley reported in 1693 that “the taverns and coffeeh ouses,
nay, Westminster Hall 〔Parliament〕, and the very churches, were full
of it.” 64 Many men in the government privately accepted it, but
publicly covered it with a conspicuous respect for the Established
Church as a beneficent form of social control that only reckless fools
would destroy. In France the materialistic philosophy affected Bayle’s
skepticism, and came to bolder developments in La Mettrie, d’Holbach,
and Diderot.</p>
<p>Bayle ranked Hobbes as “one of the greatest geniuses of the
seventeenth</p>
<p>5&lt;*4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXcentury.” 65 Honored or denounced, he was recognized as the most
power - ful philosopher that England had produced since Bacon, and as
the first Englishman to present a formal treatise in political theory.
One clear debt we owe him: he formulated his philosophy in logical order
and lucid prose. Reading him and Bacon and Locke, or Fontenelle and
Bayle and Voltaire, we perceive again what the Germans had made us
forget, that obscurity need not be the distinguishing mark of a
philosopher, and that every art should accept the moral obligation to be
intelligible or silent.</p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li>Harrington’s utopia</li>
</ol>
<p>While Hobbes defended an ailing monarchy, James Harrington proposed a
democratic utopia. Now that exploration and commerce were opening up
remote areas of the globe, and legends came to Europe with any cargo
from overseas, it was a simple matter for imaginative wordsmen to voyage
in fancy to some happy corner of the map — or, like Cyrano de Bergerac
and Tommaso Campanella, to the moon or the sun — whose political and
social customs would shame the tyranny and misery of men under “civiliza
- tion.” The cult of antiquity by the Renaissance gave way to a
futuristic romance of more or less perfect states in distant and
uncorrupted lands. So in 1656 Harrington offered his Oceana to the
coffeehouses of London.</p>
<p>Bom among the gentry, he naturally moved toward a political
philosophy favoring the minor landlords of England. After leaving Oxford
he traveled widely on the Continent, admired the Dutch Republic, served
in the Dutch army, visited Venice, was impressed by its “republican”
institutions, saw the Pope, refused to kiss the papal toe, and,
returning to England, had all his sins forgiven when he explained to
Charles I that he could not think of kissing the foot of a foreign
prince after having kissed the hand of Eng- land’s King. When Charles
was arrested, Harrington was appointed by Parliament to attend him. He
loved the unhappy prisoner, but explained to him the desirability of a
republic. He accompanied Charles to the end, was on the scaffold at the
execution, and, we are told, nearly died of grief. 66 Comforted by the
birth of the English republic, he set himself to expound his republican
ideas in fictional form. But while Harrington wrote, Crom- well changed
the new republic into a semimonarchical protectorate; and when The
Commonwealth of Oceana was passing through the press the Protector
ordered it suppressed. Cromwell’s favorite daughter, Mrs. Clay - pole,
interceded for the book, Harrington dedicated it to her father, and it
saw the light in 1656.</p>
<p>“Oceana” is England as the author hoped that Cromwell would
remake</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>5&lt;*5</p>
<p>the economic interpretation of history: political supremacy, says
Harring- ton, naturally and rightly follows economic supremacy; only in
that accord can a state enjoy stability. “Such as is the proportion of
property in land, such is the nature of the empire” — i.e., the
government. 67 If one man (as in Turkey) owns all the land, the
government will be an absolute monarchy; if a few own it, t he
government will be a “mixed monarchy” supported and limited by an
aristocracy; “and if the whole people be landlords, or hold the lands so
divided among them that no one man or number of men . . . overbalance
them, the empire (without the imposition of force) is a commonwealth.”
68 To Hobbes, who thought that all government rests on force, Harrington
answered that armies had to be fed and armed, so power goes to those who
can raise the money to feed and arm them. 69 A change in the form or
direction of the government is merely an adjustment to a change in the
distribution of property. On this basis Harrington explained the victory
of the Long Parliament, as representing the gentry, over the King as
representing the major landowners.</p>
<p>To prevent the government from being an oligarchy of large estates,
Harrington proposed an “equal agrarian” law limiting any one person to
land yielding no more than two thousand pounds a year. Actual democracy
requires a wide distribution of property; and the best democracy will be
one in which every landowner has a turn in government. In the true Eng-
lish republic the citizens will send landowners to serve in a popular
assembly and a senate. The senate alone will propose laws, the assembly
alone will pass or reject them. The senators will nominate candidates
for public office; from that list the citizens will elect the
magistrates by secret ballot. 70 Each year one third of the assemblymen,
the senators, and the magistrates will be replaced by other men in a new
election; by this rotation all landowners will ultimately have a term in
the government. Popular election will pro- tect the community against
lawyers serving private interests, and against the clergy — “those
declared and inveterate enemies of popular power.” 71 There will be
universal education in national schools and colleges, and complete
freedom of religion.</p>
<p>“The Doctrine was very taking,” reported Aubrey, and soon found en -
thusiastic supporters. Harrington gathered some of these (including
Aubrey) in a “Rota” club (1659), which agitated for parliamentary enact
- ment of his rotarian republic. He ascribed the current collapse of the
Commonwealth to its failure to confiscate the large estates and
redistribute the land in smaller parcels among the people; that failure
left the nobles still powerful, and the people still poor and powerless;
on the principle that property dictates government, the restoration of
an oligarchic monarchy was inevitable unless Parli ament voted the
“agrarian law.” “But,” says Aubrey, “the greatest part of the Parliament
-men perfectly hated this design</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXof Rotation by Ballotting, for they were cursed tyrants and in love
with their power ”; 72 they preferred to recall Charles II. As
Harrington con - tinued to propagate his plan even after the
Restoration, the King had him committed to the Tower on a charge of
conspiracy ( 1 66 1 ) . When efforts were made to free him by habeas
corpus, he was transported to closer con- finement on an island off
Plymouth. There he fell into spells of insanity. He was released, but he
never regained his health.</p>
<p>His utopia was more practical than most, and much of it has been
real- ized. Perhaps one weakness lay in its assumption that land is the
only form of wealth. Harrington mentioned the power of money in commerce
and industry, but did not foresee its rise to political power; he may
have felt that even commercial and industrial wealth is ultimately
subject to owners of the land. The gradual extension of the franchise,
and the secrecy of the ballot, were in line with his hopes; and though
Britain rejected rotation in office as an annual dismemberment of
experience, the United States ac- cepted it in the periodical election
of a part of Congress; and Locke,</p>
<p>Montesquieu, and America approved his separation of governmental
powers. Let not dreamers despair; time may surprise them with
fulfillments, and turn their poetry into prose.</p>

<li>THE DEISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>As the religious wars injured religious belief in France, so the
Civil War in England shared in generating theological doubts. Memories
of the Puritan regime made irreligion popular among the triumphant
royalists, and made atheism ribald and boisterous at the Restoration
court. The first Earl of Shaftesbury, the second Duke of Buckingham, and
the second Earl of Rochester were suspected of atheism; so, later, were
Halifax and Boling- broke.</p>
<p>The extension of geographical, historical, and scientific knowledge
wid- ened the skeptical current. Every day some traveler or chronicler
told of great nations whose religion and morals were shockingly
different from the Christian, but usually as virtuous, and seldom as
homicidal. The mechanical view of the world encouraged by the pious
Descartes and the apocalyptic Newton seemed to be pushing Providence out
of sight; the discovery of law in nature was making miracles
indigestible; the slow triumph of Coper- nicus and the dramatic
prosecution of Galileo contributed to the erosion of belief. The brave
attempt of many Christian theologians to demonstrate the creed by reason
weakened the creed; no one, said Anthony Collins, doubted the existence
of God until the Boyle lecturers undertook to prove</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>567</p>
<p>The refutations of atheism attested its spread. Sir William Temple
wrote (1672) “of those who w ould pass for wits … by saying things
which,</p>
<p>David tells us, the fool hath said in his heart.” 74 In the same year
Sir Charles</p>
<p>. . . the ignorant and unlearned among ourselves are become the</p>
<p>greatest pretenders to skepticism and infidelity. . . . Atheism and
ir-</p>
<p>religion are at length become as common as vice and debauchery. . . .
Plebeians and mechanics have philosophized themselves into principles of
impiety, and read their lectures of atheism in the streets and high-
ways. And they are able to demonstrate out of The Leviathan that</p>
<p>there is no God. 76</p>
<p>Among the educated classes doubt sought a compromise in Unitarianism,
“natural religion,” and deism. The Unitarians questioned the equality of
Christ with the Father, but they usually accepted the divine authority
of the Bible. The advocates of natural religion preferred a faith
independent of Scripture and limited to beliefs which they thought
universal — in God and immortality. The deists, who made their chief
stir in England, re- quired only a belief in God, whom they sometimes
depersonalized into a synonym for Nature, or the Prime Pusher of the
Cartesian or Newtonian world machine. The word deist first came into
prominence in 1677,</p>
<p>through Archdeacon Edward Stillingfleet’s Letter to a Deist , but the
deistic literature had begun with Lord Herbert of Cherbury’s De Veritate
in 1624.</p>
<p>Lord Herbert’s disciple, Charles Blount, carried on with Anima Mundi
(1679). All organized religion, ran the argument, was the creation of
im- postors seeking political power or material gain; heaven and hell
were among their clever inventions to control and milk the populace. The
soul dies with the body. Men and beasts are so alike that “some authors
are of opinion that man is nothing but an ape cultivated.” In Great Is
Diana of the Ephesians , or The Origin of Idolatry (1680), Blount made
priests them- selves the tools of privileged classes that fattened on
the patient labor and credulity of the people. With impish subtlety he
translated Philostratus’ Life of Apollonius of T yana, indicated the
similarities between the miracles ascribed to the pagan wonder-worker
and those attributed to Christians, and gently suggested their equal
incredibility. In A Summary Account of the Deists’ Religion (1686)
Blount proposed a religion free from all cult and ritual, and consisting
only of the worship of God by a moral life. In The Oracles of Reason
(1693) he pointed out that the Christian theology was at first based
upon the erroneous expectation of an early end to the world. He

<p>XXAdam’s rib, of original sin, of the stopping of the sun by Joshua,
as childish absurdities, and suggested that “to believe our modern earth
(a blind and sordid particle of the universe, inferior to each of the
fixed stars as well in bulk as in dignity) to be the heart, the most
noble and vital part, of so vast a body, is irrational and repugna nt to
the nature of things.” An</p>
<p>anonymous work uncertainly ascribed to Blount, Miracles No Violations
of the Laws of Nature (1683), tried to explain many miracle stories as
honest misconceptions, by simple minds, of natural causes and events.
The Bible , it added, was written to “excite pious affections,” not to
teach</p>
<p>John Toland continued the campaign. Born in Ireland, he was brought
up as a Roman Catholic, but was converted to Protestantism in his youth.
He studied at Glasgow, Leiden, and Oxford. At twenty-six he issued</p>
<p>anonymously Christianity Not Mysterious (1696), which he described as
“a treatise showing t hat there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to
reason, nor above it.” Accepting Locke’s recent Essay concerning Human
Under - standing as having proved the sense origin of all knowledge, he
drew from it a thoroughgoing rationalism:</p>
<p>We hold that Reason is the only foundation of all our certitude,</p>
<p>and that nothing revealed … is more exempted from its disquisitions
than the ordinary phenomena of Nature. … To believe the divinity</p>
<p>of Scripture, or the sense of any passage thereof, without
rational</p>
<p>proof and an evident consistency, is a blamable credulity . . .
ordi-</p>
<p>narily grounded upon an ignorant and willful disposition, but
more</p>
<p>generally maintained out of a gainful prospect. 78</p>
<p>This was a declaration of war, but as Toland proceeded he unveiled an
olive branch by arguing that the basic doctrines of Christianity,
excepting transubstantiation, are quite reasonable. Nevertheless his
challenge was not ignored. The grand juries of Middlesex and Dublin
joined hands across the Irish Sea to condemn the book; it was officially
burned before the doors of the Irish Parliament, and Toland was
sentenced to jail. He escaped to England, but, unable to secure
employment there, he migrated to the Continent. For a time he found
welcome with Electress Sophia of Hanover and her daughter Sophia
Charlotte, Queen of Prussia.</p>
<p>To the latter he addressed Letters to Serena (1704). One of these
tried to trace the origin and growth of the belief in immortality; this
was among</p>
<p>GHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>569</p>
<p>the first attempts at a natural history of supernatural beliefs.
Another letter disputed the view that matter is by itself inert and
motionless; motion, said Toland, is inherent in matter, and no body is
in absolute rest. All objective phenomena are the motions of matter,
including the actions of animals, and this might be true of man as well.
79 Here, however, Toland checked him- self; such thoughts should not be
publicly expressed, for the uneducated multitude must be left in
undisturbed orthodoxy as a means of moral and social control.
Freethinking should be the duty, and the exclusive privilege, of the
educated minority. Among these there should be no censorship; “let all
men free ly speak what they think, without being ever branded or
punished but for wicked practices.” 80 The terms freethinker and
pantheist were apparently coined by Toland. 81</p>
<p>His essay Nazar enus (1718) suggested that Christ had not intended to
separate his followers from Judaism, and that the Jewish Christians, who
continued to observe the Mosaic Law, represented “the true original plan
of Christianity.” A pamphlet, Pantheisticus, expounded the creed and
ritual of an imaginary secret society; perhaps Toland was a member of
the “Mother Grand Lodge” of Freemasonry which was established in London
in 1717. The society described by Toland rejected all supernatural
revela- tions, proposed a new religion agreeing with philosophy,
identified God with the universe, and replaced the saints of the
Christian calendar with the heroes of liberty and thought. The society
allowed its members to con- form to the popular worship so long as,
through their political influence, they could render fanaticism
harmless. 82</p>
<p>After a fitful and varied career Toland retired to a life of poverty
in</p>
<p>England, kept from starvation by Lord Molesworth and the philosopher
Shaftesbury. He bore up stoutly under the storm of refutations
(fifty-four in sixty years) that fell upon his books. He claimed that
philosophy had granted him “perfect tranquillity,” and had freed him
from “the terrors of death.” 83 Attacked by an incurable disease at the
age of fifty -two (1722), he composed his own proud epitaph:</p>
<p>Here lies John Toland, who was born . . . near Londonderry. . . .</p>
<p>He cultivated the various literatures, and was acquainted with more
than ten languages. The Champion of Truth, the Defender of Liberty, he
bound himself to no man, on no man did he fawn. Neither threats nor
misfortunes deterred him from his appointed course, which he</p>
<p>pursued to the very end, subordinating his own interest to the
pursuit of the Good. His soul is united with the Heavenly Father, from
whom he first proceeded. Beyond all doubt he will live again unto all
eternity, yet never will there be another Toland. … For the rest

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXAnthony Collins took up the deist cause with more skill and
modesty. He had the advantages of money, a house in the country, a house
in the town; he could not be refuted by starvation. He was a man of fine
manners and irreproachable character. Locke, who knew him well, wrote to
him: “To love truth for truth’s sake is the principal part of human
perfection in this world, and the seed-plot of all other virtues; and,
if I mistake not, you have as much of it as ever I met with in anybody.”
86 Collins’ Dis - course of Freethinking (1713) was the ablest
exposition that deism re- ceived in this age.</p>
<p>He defined freethinking as “the use of the understanding in
endeavoring to find out the meaning of any proposition whatsoever, in
considering the nature of the evidence for or against it, and in judging
of it according to the seeming force or weakness of the evidence. . . .
There is no other way to discover the truth.” 86 The diversity of
creeds, and the contradictory</p>
<p>He tries to answer the objections that cautious men advanced against
free thought: that most people have not the capacity to think both
freely and harmlessly about fundamental problems; that such freedom
would lead to endless divisions of opinion and sects, and therefore to
disorders in society; that freethinking may conduce to atheism in
religion and libertin- ism in morals. He gives ancient Greece and modern
Turkey as examples of social order maintained despite freedom of opinion
or diversity of faiths. He denies that freethinking makes for atheism;
he quotes and supports Bacon’s aphorism about a little thought inclining
us to atheism, and more thought turning us away from it; ignorance, he
adds, with apparent sin- cerity, “is the foundation of atheism, and
freethinking the cure for it.” 88 He lists freethinkers who were “the
most virtuous people in all ages”: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus,
Plutarch, Varro, Cato Censor, Cato of Utica, Cicero, Seneca, Solomon,
the Prophets, Origen, Erasmus, Montaigne, Bacon, Hobbes, Milton,
Tillotson, Locke; here and in Toland we have a model for Comte’s
calendar of positivist saints. And (Collins suggests) an - other list
could be made of those foes of free thought who disgraced humanity with
barbarous cruelties under the pretext of glorifying God.</p>
<p>So many replies rained down upon him from pulpits and universities
that Collins thought discretion required travel. His stay in Holland
may</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>have left upon him some influence from Spinoza and Bayle. Returning
to England, he raised another storm with an Inquiry concerning Human
Liberty (1715), which stated with clarity and force the case for de-</p>
<p>terminism; Collins found himself a freethinker slave to an unfree
will. Nine years later he set the theological air astir by a Discourse
on the Grounds and Reason of the Christian Religion. He quoted the
Apostles and Pascal as basing their demonstration of Christianity on Old
Testament prophecies which the new dispensation had seemingly fulfilled,
and he argued that these predictions had no reference to Christianity or
Christ. Thirty-five theologians answered him in thirty-five tracts. The
controversy was still alive when Voltaire reached England in 1726; he
enjoyed it mischievously, and imported it into France, where it entered
into the skeptical En-</p>
<p>lightenment.</p>
<p>The deistic movement was continued in England by William Whiston,
Matthew Tindal, Thomas Chubb, and Conyers Middleton, and passed down
through Bolingbroke and the philosopher Shaftesbury to Gibbon and Hume.
It became unpopular with the ruling classes when they sus- pected it of
encouraging democratic ideas; but its immediate influence was felt in a
temporary decline of religious belief. In 17 1 1 an official report on
the subject was drawn up for the Upper House of Convocation of the
English clergy in the province of Canterbury. It described a wide spread
of unbelief and profanity, denials of Biblical inspiration, rejection of
mira- cles as fables, ridicule of the doctrine of the Trinity, doubts of
immortality, and much decrying of priests as impostors. 89 By the
beginning of the eighteenth century in England “religion had sunk to
deism.” 90 It was in this crisis that some of the ablest minds in
Britain rose vigorously to the defense of Christianity.</p>
<p>rv. DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH</p>
<p>Most of them were willing to meet their assailants on the grounds of
reason, scholarship, and history; this in itself betrayed the spirit of
the age.</p>
<p>Charles Leslie led the defense with A Short and Easy Method with the
Deists (1697), intended originally as a reply to Blount. The evidences
for the Biblical narratives, he argued, were of the same nature, and as
con- vincing, as for the careers of Alexander and Caesar; the miracles
were at- tested by testimony as plentiful and reliable as that which is
accepted as adequate in English courts; priests could never have
persuaded peoples of such miracles as the parting of the Red Sea unless
many eyewitnesses had corroborated them. Leslie rounded out his argument
by portraying Judaism as a primitive covenant superseded by the coming
of Christ, Moham-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmedanism as an ungrateful imitation of Christianity by an ambitious
im- postor, and paganism as a mass of fables too childish for rational
belief. Only the Christian religion met all the tests of evidence and
reason.</p>
<p>Samuel Clarke, who knew enough mathematics and physics to defend
Newton against Leibniz, undertook to prove the Christian creed by dem-
onstrations as rigorous as geometry. In his Boyle lectures of 1 704 he
forged a chain of twelve propositions which in his judgment established
the existence, omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, and benevolence
of God. The chain of contingent or dependent beings and causes, he
supposed, compels us to assume a necessary and independent being who is
the first cause of all causes. God must have intelligence, for there is
intelligence in created beings, and the creator must be more perfect
than the creature; God must be free, for otherwise His intelligence
would be a senseless slavery. This, of course, added nothing to ancient
or medieval philosophy; but in the second series of his Boyle lectures
Clarke proposed to prove “the truth and certainty of the Christian
revelation.” Moral principles, he thought, are as absolute as the laws
of nature; man’s depraved nature, how- ever, can be led to obey these
moral rules only through the inculcation of religious beliefs; hence it
was necessary that God give us the Bible, and the doctrines of heaven
and hell. History, with its usual humor, adds that Clarke was dismissed
by Queen Anne as her chaplain because he was suspected of doubting the
Trinity. In the next reign, according to the impish Voltaire, he was
prevented from becoming archbishop of Canter- bury because a bishop
informed Prinpess ’Caroline that Clarke was the most learned man in
England, but had one defect — he was not a Christian. 91</p>
<p>The still more learned Bentley had already demonstrated “the Folly
and Unreasonableness of Atheism” in the Boyle lectures of 1692 -93.
Twenty years later he was arous ed by Collins’ book to issue some
Remarks on a Late Discourse of Freethinking. This chiefly consisted of
exposing errors in Collins’ scholarship; the argument seemed
overwhelming, and the senate of Cambridge University gave Bentley a
unanimous vote of thanks.</p>
<p>Jonathan Swift, who was then serving the deist Bolingbroke, thought
that Collins, for having revealed a secret that all gentlemen kept to
themselves, deserved additional chastisement; this he administered in a
tract called Mr. Collins’ Discourse of Freethinking, Put into Plain
English . . . for the Use of the Poor. He burlesqued Collins’ arguments
by humorous exag - gerations; he added that since most men are fools, it
would be disastrous to leave them free to think; “the bulk of mankind is
as well qualified for flying as for thinking” 92 — which is now a more
hopeful statement than Swift intended it to be. He agreed with Hobbes
that dictatorship, even in spiritualibus, is the sole alternative to
anarchy. We have seen that the</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>573</p>
<p>Irish Anglicans thought the gloomy Dean would make an excellent
prelate if he believed in God.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Platonists defended Christianity with less wit and more
sincerity. They went back to Plato and Plotinus to find a bridge between
reason and God, and they illustrated their faith not so much by
arguments as by the integrity and devotion of their lives. They had so
strong a sense of divinity surrounding them that this seemed to them the
most immediate testimony of reason. Hence their first leader, Benjamin
Whichcote, claimed that “reason is the voice of God .” 93</p>
<p>Henry More, the outstanding member of this once famous group, went
beyond the philosophies of Europe to an almost Hindu sense of the
vanity, the literal emptiness, of sense knowledge, its incapacity to
satisfy the long- ing of the solitary soul for some companionship and
significance in the universe. The cosmic mechanism of Descartes gave him
no comfort; he found more to his needs in the Neoplatonists, the Jewish
mystics, and Jakob Bohme. He wondered “whether the knowledge of things
was really that supreme felicity of man, or something greater and more
divine was; or, supposing it to be so, whether it was to be acquired by
such an eager- ness or intentness in the reading of authors, or
contemplating of things; or by the purging of the mind from all sorts of
vices whatsoever .” 94 He resolved to cleanse himself of all
self-seeking, all worldliness, all intellectual curiosity. “When this
inordinate desire after the knowledge of things was thus allayed in me,
and I aspired after nothing but this sole purity and simplicity of mind,
there shone in upon me daily a greater assurance than ever I could have
expected, even of those things which before I had the greatest desire to
know .” 95 Gradually, he tells us, he so purified himself in body and
soul that his flesh, in the spring season, gave forth a sweet odor, and
his urine had the fragrance of violets . 96</p>
<p>So cleansed, he seemed to feel the reality of spirit in himself as
the most convincing experience possible to man; and from this conviction
he passed readily to the belief that the world was peopled by other
spirits, of ascend- ing grades, from the lowest to God Himself. All
motion in matter, he thought, is the operation of some species of
spirit. Instead of the material plenum of Hobbes, More proposed a
spiritual universe in which matter was merely the tool and vehicle of
spirit. This animating anima occasionally expanded beyond its
habitation; how else explain magnetism, electricity, and gravity? More
went on to accept the reality of devils, witches, and ghosts. He was an
amiable and unselfish soul, refusing the worldly prefer- ments offered
him, and remaining on friendly terms with materialist Hobbes. Hobbes
said that if he ever found his own opinions untenable, he “would embrace
the philosophy of Dr. More .” 97</p>
<p>Ralph Cudworth, the most learned of the Cambridge Platonists,
under-</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXtook to prove Hobbes’s opinions untenable. The True Intellectual
System of the Universe (1678) challenged Hobbes to explain why, in
addition to the various sensory and muscular motions to which he had
reduced the operations of the mind, there is also, in many cases, an
awareness of these motions; how can a materialist philosophy find room
and function for consciousness? If all is matter in motion, why should
not the nervous system, through sensation and response, as in reflexes,
attend to every- thing, and not be bothered with a superfluous
consciousness? How can we deny reality — even primacy — to a
consciousness without which no reality whatever could be known?
Knowledge is no passive receptacle of sensations, it is the active
transformation of sensations into ideas. 98 Here, in Cudworth, we have,
long in advance, the answer of Berkeley and Kant to Hobbes and Hume.</p>
<p>Joseph Glanvill, chaplain to Charles II, was not geographically one
of the Cambridge Platonists, but he strongly agreed with them. In The
Vanity of Dogmatizing (1661) he turned the guilt of dogmatism upon
science and philosophy, arguing that they had built up grandiose systems
of doctrine upon insecure foundations. So the notion of cause (which
Glanvill sup- posed indispensable to science) is an unwarrantable
assumption; we know sequences, relations, and occasions, but we have no
idea of what it is in one thing that produces an effect in itself or
another (another premonition of Hume) . Consider, says Glanvill, how
ignorant we are of the most basic things — the nature and origin of the
soul, and its relation to the body. “How should a thought be un ited to
… a lump of clay? The freezing</p>
<p>of the words in the air in northern climes is as inconceivable as
this strange union. . . . And to hang weights on the wings of the wind
seems far more intelligible.” 99 Anticipating Bergson, Glanvill charges
the intellect with being a constitutional materialist — so used to
dealing with matter that it loses capacity to think of other realities
except by a “return to material phantasms,” or images. 100 How fallible
our senses are! They make it ap - pear that the earth is at rest in
space, whereas the latest pundits assure us that it is dizzy with a
variety of simultaneous motions. And even supposing that our senses have
not deceived us, how often do we reason wrongly from correct premises!
Our feelings time a nd again mislead us; “we easily believe what we
wish.” And our mental environment often dominates our reasoning.</p>
<p>Opinions have their climes and national diversities. . . . They
that</p>
<p>never peeped beyond the common belief in which their easy under-
standings were at first indoctrinated, are indubitably assured of the
Truth and comparative excellency of their receptions. . . . The larger
souls, that have traveled the divers climates of opinion 〔here is
born</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>a famous phrase〕 are more cautious in their resolves, and more
sparing to determine . 101</p>
<p>Despite these warnings to science, Glanvill was a zealous member of
the Royal Society, defended it against charges of irreligion, applauded
its achievements, and looked forward to a world of marvels to come from
scientific research:</p>
<p>I doubt not but posterity will find many things, that are now but</p>
<p>rumors, verified into practical realities. It may be, some ages
hence, a voyage to the Southern unknown tracts, yea possibly to the
moon,</p>
<p>will not be more strange than one to America. To them that come</p>
<p>after us it may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly into
re-</p>
<p>motest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey. And to
confer at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyances may be
as usual to future times, as to us in a literary correspondence. The
resto- ration of gray hairs to juvenility, and renewing the exhausted
marrow, may at length be effected without a miracle; and the turning of
the</p>
<p>now comparatively desert world into a paradise may not improbably be
expected from late agriculture . 102</p>
<p>We must add that Glanvill, like Cudworth and Henry More, believed in
witches. They argued that if there is a spiritual as well as a material
world, there must be spirits as well as bodies in the universe; and
judging from the parlous state of things some of these spirits must be
devilish. If pious people communicate with God or saints or angels, why
should not wicked p eople communicate with Satan and his demons? The
Devil’s last stratagem, said Glanvill, is to spread the belief that he
does not exist. “Those that dare not bluntly say, There is no God,
content themselves (for a fair step and introduction) to deny that there
are spirits and</p>
<p>witches .” 103 Satan had to be rescued for God’s sake.</p>
<p>V. JOHN LOCKE: 1632-1704</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Biography</li>
</ol>
<p>The most influential philosopher of this age was born at
Wrington,</p>
<p>near Bristol, in the same year as Spinoza. He grew up in an England
that made a bloody revolution and killed its King; he became the voice
of a peaceful revolution and an age of moderation and tolerance, and
repre- sented English compromise at its sanest and best. His father was
a Puritan</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXJ76</p>
<p>attorney, who at some sacrifice supported the Parliamentary cause,
and expounded to his son the doctrines of popular sovereignty and
representa- tive government. Locke remained faithful to these lessons,
and grateful for the paternal discipline that trained him to sobriety,
simplicity, and industry. Lady Masham said of Locke’s father that he</p>
<p>used a conduct towards him when young that he 〔the son〕 often</p>
<p>spoke of afterwards with great approbation. It was the being severe
to him by keeping him in much awe and at a distance when he was a</p>
<p>boy, but relaxing still by degrees of that severity as he grew up to
be a man, till, he being become capable of it, he lived perfectly with
him as a friend. 104</p>
<p>Locke bore no similar gratitude toward his teachers. At Westminster
School he was choked with Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, and was
probably not allowed to witness the execution of Charles I (1649) in
nearby Whitehall Palace Yard; but that event left a mark on his
philosophy. The turmoil of the Civil War delayed his entry into Christ
College, Ox- ford, till he was twenty years old. There he studied
Aristotle as dressed in Latin Scholastic form; more Greek; some geometry
and rhetoric; much logic and ethics, most of which he later disgorged as
antequated in sub- stance and indigestible in form. After taking his
master’s degree (1658) he remained at Oxford as a don, tutoring and
lecturing. He had a love affair which for a time “robbed me of the use
of my reason”; 105 he re - gained his reason and lost the lady. Like
nearly all the philosophers in this period — Malebranche, Bayle,
Fontenelle, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz — he never married. He was advised
to enter the ministry, but he demurred at “being lifted into a place
which perhaps I cannot fill, and from whence there is no descending
without tumbling.” 106</p>
<p>In 1661 his father died of tuberculosis, leaving him with a small
fortune and weak lungs. He studied medicine, but did not take the
medical degree till 1674. Meanwhile he read Descartes, and felt the
fascination of philoso- phy when it spoke intelligibly. He helped Robert
Boyle in laboratory experiments, and acquired an admiration for
scientific method. In 1667 he received an invitation to come and live at
Exeter House as personal phy- sician to Anthony Ashley Cooper, soon to
be first Earl of Shaftesbury, member of the Cabal ministry under Charles
II. From that time onward, though keeping Oxford as his legal home till
1683, Locke found himself in the stream of English politics, whose
events and figures molded his thought.</p>
<p>As physician he saved Shaftesbury’s life by a skillful operation for
tumor (1668). He helped to negotiate the marriage of the Earl’s son,
attended the daughter-in-law in her confinement, and directed the
education of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>grandson, his successor in philosophy. “Mr. Locke,” recalled th is
third Earl of Shaftesbury,</p>
<p>grew so much in esteem with my grandfather that, as great a man as he
experienced him in physic, he looked upon this as but his least
part.</p>
<p>He encouraged him to turn his thoughts another way; nor would he
suffer him to practice physic except in his own family, and as a kind-
ness to some particular friend. He put him upon the study of the</p>
<p>religious and civil affairs of the nation, with whatsoever related
to</p>
<p>the business of a minister of state; in which he was so successful
that my grandfather began to use him as a friend, and consult with
him</p>
<p>on all occasions of that kind. 107</p>
<p>For two years (1673-75) Locke served as secretary to the Council
of</p>
<p>Trade and Plantations (Colonies), of which Shaftesbury was president.
He helped Shaftesbury to draft a constitution for Carolina, of which the
Earl was a founder and a chief proprietor; these “Fundamental
Institutions” were not generally carried out in the colony, but the
freedom of conscience provided in them was largely accepted by the new
settlement. 108</p>
<p>When Shaftesbury fell from office in 1675 Locke traveled and studied
in France. There he met Frangois Bernier, who introduced him to the
philoso- phy of Gassendi; therein he found a reasoned rejection of
“innate ideas,” the comparison of the unborn child’s mind to a tabula
rasa, or clean slate, and the key sentence that was to be later bandied
across the Channel: Nihil est in intellectu nisi quod prius fuerit in
sensu — “There is nothing in the mind except what w as first in the
senses.”</p>
<p>Locke returned to London and Shaftesbury in 1679, but as the Earl</p>
<p>ventured closer and closer to revolution, Locke retired to Oxford
(1680), and resumed the life of a scholar. Shaftesbury’s arrest, escape,
and flight to Holland cast royal suspicion upon his friends. Spies were
sent to Oxford to catch Locke in remarks that might serve as a basis for
prosecuting him. 109 Feeling insecure, and foreseeing the accession of
his enemy James II, Locke too sought refuge in Holland (1683). The
abortive revolution of the Duke of Monmouth (1685) provoked James to
demand from the Dutch government the extradition of eighty-five
Englishmen on the charge that they had shared in the plot to overthrow
the new King; Locke was named among them. He hid, and took a false name.
A year later James sent him an offer of pardon, but Locke preferred to
remain in Holland. Living in Utrecht. Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, he
enjoved the friendship not only of English refugees but of Dutch
scholars like Jean Le Clerc</p>
<p>and Philip van Limborch, both of them leaders in the liberal Arminian
theology. In that environment Locke found much encouragement for his
ideas of popular sovereignty and religious freedom. There he wrote
his</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXEssay concerning Human Understanding, and the first drafts of his
treatises on education and toleration.</p>
<p>In 1687 he joined in the plot to replace James II with William III
on</p>
<p>the throne of England. 110 When the expedition of the Stadholder
succeeded in this enterprise, Locke sailed to England (1689) on the same
vessel that carried the future Queen Mary. 111 Before leaving Holland he
wrote to Limborch, in Latin, a letter whose warmth of sentiment may
correct the supposition that his habitual moderation stemmed from
coldness of char- acter:</p>
<p>In going away, I almost feel as though I were leaving my own</p>
<p>country and my own kinsfolk; for everything that belongs to kinship,
good will, love, kindness — everything that binds men together with ties
stronger than that of blood — I have found among you in abun- dance. I
leave behind me friends whom I can never forget, and I</p>
<p>shall never cease to wish for an opportunity of coming back to enjoy
once more the genuine fellowship of men who have been such friends that,
while far away from my own connections, while suffering in</p>
<p>every other way, I have never felt sick at heart. As for you,
best,</p>
<p>dearest, and most worthy of men, when I think of your learning, your
wisdom, your kindness and candor and gentleness, I seem to have</p>
<p>found in your friendship alone enough to make me always rejoice that
I was forced to pass so many years amongst you. 112</p>
<p>In an England governed by his friends, Locke passed through a
suc-</p>
<p>cession of official employments. In 1690 he was a commissioner of
appeals; in 1696-1700 he was a commissioner of trade and plantations. He
was intimate with John Somers, attorney general, with Charles Montagu,
first Earl of Halifax, and with Isaac Newton, whom he aided in reforming
the coinage. After 1691 he lived most of the time at Oates Manor in
Essex with Sir Francis Masham and his wife, Lady Damaris Masham, a
daughter of Ralph Cudworth. He remained in that quiet haven, writing and
rewriting, till his death.</p>
<p>2 . Government and Property</p>
<p>When he came back from exile he was already fifty-six years old. So
far he had published only some minor articles, and a French epitome of
his Essay in Le Clerc’s Bibliotheque universelle (1688). He was not yet
known as a philosopher except to a few friends. Then, all in one annus
mirabilis, he sent to the press three works that made him a major figure
in European thought. In March, 1689, his Epistola de Toler antia
appeared</p>

<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>in Holland; it was translated into English in the fall; and it was
followed in 1690 by a Second Letter concerning Toleration. In February,
1690, be issued his two Treatises on Government , the cornerstone of
modern democratic theory in England and America; and a month later the
Essay concerning Human Understanding , the most influential book in
modern psychology. Though this had been completed before he left
Holland, he preceded it in print by the Treatises on Government because
he was anxious to provide a philosophical basis for the Glorious
Revolution of 16^8-89. This purpose was frankly stated in the preface to
the first treatise: “to establish the throne of our great restorer, our
present William III; to make good his title in the consent of the people
. . . and to justify to the worjd the people of England, whose love of
their just and natural rights, with their resolution to preserve them,
saved the nation when it was on the brink of slavery and ruin.” 113</p>
<p>Tnp first and lesser treatise undertook to answer the Patriarcloa, or
The Natural Power of Kings Asserted, which Sir Robert Filmer had written
about ,1642 to uphold the divine right of Charles I, but which had only
recently (1680) reached print in the heyday of Charles II’s triumphant
absolutism. It was not the best of Sir Robert’s writings. He published
anonymously in 1648 The Anarchy of a Limited Mixed Monarchy, antici-
pating Hobbes’s views. Though he suffered imprisonment for his defense
of a losing cause, he defended it again in Observations upon Aristotle’s
Politiques, published anonymously in 1652, a year before the author’s
death.</p>
<p>Filmer presented government as an extension of the family. God con-
ferred sovereignty over the first human family upon Adam, from whom it
descended to the patriarchs. Those who (like Filmer’s opponents) believe
in the divine inspiration of the Bible must admit that the patriarchal
family, and the power of the patriarch, were sanctioned by God. From the
patri- archs this sovereignty passed to kings; the early kings were
patriarchs, and their authority was a form and derivative of parental
rule. Monarchy, therefore, goes back to Adam, and so to God; its
sovereignty, except when it commands an explicit violation of God’s law,
is divine and absolute; and rebellion against it is a sin as well as a
crime. 114</p>
<p>Against the theory that man is born free, Filmer points out that man
is born subject to the customs and laws of the group, and to the natural
and legal rights of parents over their children; “natural freedom” is a
romantic myth. It is also a myth that government was originally
established by the consent and agreement of the people. “Representative
government” is an - other myth; actually the representative is chosen by
a small and active minority in each constituency. 1 15 All government is
of a majority by a minority. It is in the nature of government to be
above the laws, for by</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXdefinition a legislature is empowered to make and unmake laws. “We
do but flatter ourselves if we hope ever to be governed without an
arbitrary power .” 116 If government is to depend upon the will of the
governed, there</p>
<p>multitude .” 117</p>
<p>Locke felt that his first task, as defender of the Glorious
Revolution, was to dispose of Filmer’s arguments. He thought “there was
never so much glib nonsense put together in well- sounding English” as
in Sir</p>
<p>Robert’s discourses . 118 “I should not speak so plainly of a
gentleman long since past answering, had not the pulpit, of late years,
publicly owned his doctrine and made it the current divinity of the
times” — i.e., had not the Anglican clergy upheld the divine right of
kings even under Catholic</p>
<p>James II. Locke proceeded with playful, sometimes ungracious, sarcasm
to question Filmer’s derivation of royal authority from the supposed
sovereignty of Adam and the patriarchs; we need not follow him in his
long Biblical refutation; today we rationalize our political prejudices
by other than Scriptural means. Something of Filmer remains after
Locke’s rough handling of him — the attempt, however mistaken in detail,
to illumi- nate the nature of government by seeking its origins in
history, even in biology. Probably both Filmer and Locke underestimated
the role of conquest and force in the establishment of states.</p>
<p>In the Second Treatise of Civil Government Locke turned to the task
of finding for the rule of William III in England some more defensible
basis than a divine right that would unfortunately return the power to
James II. In deriving William’s title from the consent of the go verned
he assumed more than he could historically prove: the people had not
given their consent to William’s conquest of England, and the
aristocrats who had maneuvered it had thought not of securing popular
consent, but only of avoiding public resistance. Nevertheless, in
building a philosophical prop for William’s power, Locke raised an
impressive defense of popular sovereignty. While defending a monarch he
developed the theory of rep- resentative government; and while offering
a rationale to the Whigs and the defenders of property he formulated the
gospel of political liberty. He ended, in English political philosophy,
the ascendancy of Hobbes.</p>
<p>He followed Hobbes in assuming a primitive “state of nature”
before</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>5 8l</p>
<p>instincts as a psychological preparation for society. Occasionally
Locke makes some amiable assumptions — “Every man being . . . naturally
free, and nothing being able to put him into subjection to any earthly
power without his consent . . .” 119 The state of nature, in this
theory, was not a Hobbesian war of each against all, for the “law of
nature” supported the rights of men as reasoning animals. By reason
(Locke supposed) men came to an agreement — made a “social contract”
with one another — to surrender their individual rights of judging and
punishing not to a king but to the community as a whole. Hence the
community is the real</p>
<p>sovereign. By its majority vote it selects a chief administrator to
implement its will. 120 He may be called king, but, like any other
citizen, he is bound to obey the laws enacted by the community. If (like
James II) he seeks to violate or circumvent them, the community has the
right to withdraw from him the authority which it has conferred.</p>
<p>Locke was really defending not William against James, but (the now
victorious) Parliament against any king. The highest power in a state
should be the legislature. It should be chosen by the unpurchased vote
of the people, and the laws should punish severely any attempt to buy
the vote of a citizen or a legislator; Locke did not foresee that his
admired William III would be forced to buy the vote of M.P.S, and that
powerful families would continue for yet 140 years to control and
dispose of the vote of “rotten boroughs.” The functions of the
legislature should be strictly separate from those of the executive, and
each of these branches of the government should serve as a check upon
the other.</p>
<p>“Government,” said Locke, “has no other end but the preservation of
property.” 121 There had once been a primitive communism, when food grew
without planting and men could live without toil; but when labor began
communism ended, for a man naturally claimed as his separate property
anything whose value had been created by his work. Labor, then, is the
source of “ninety - nine hundredths” of all physic al values. 122 (Here,
quite without intending it, Locke offered one of its basic tenets to
modern socialism.) Civilization grows through labor, and therefore
through the institution of property as the product of labor.
Theoretically no man should have more property than he can use; 123 but
the invention of money enabled him to sell such surplus product of his
labor as he could not utilize; and in this way there developed the great
inequality of possessions among men. We might have expected at this
point some criticism of the concentration of wealth; instead, Locke
looked upon property, however unequally dis- tributed, as natural and
sacred; the continuance of social order and civiliza- tion requires that
the protection of property shall be the paramount purpose of the state.
“The supreme power cannot take from any man part of his property without
his consent.” 124</p>
<p>582</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXOn this basis Locke could not admit any revolution involving the
ex- propriation of property. But as the “prophet and voice of the
Glorious Revolution” 125 he could not deny the right to overthrow a
government. “The people are absolved from obedience when illegal
attempts are made upon their liberties or properties,” for “the end of
government is the good of mankind. And which is best for mankind? That
the people should be always exposed to the boundless will of tyranny, or
that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be opposed when they grow
exorbitant in the use of their power and employ it for the destruction
and not the preservation of the properties of their people?” 126 Whereas
some Huguenot and some Jesuit philosophers had sanctioned revolution to
protect the one true re- ligion, Locke sanctions it only to protect
property. Secularization was changing the locus and definition of
sanctity.</p>
<p>Locke’s influence on political thought remained supreme till Karl
Marx.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the achievement of that second treatise remains
immense. It broadened the victory of Parliament and the Whigs over the
monarchy and the Tories into a theory of representative and responsible
government that inspired one people after another in its climb to
liberty. England rejected Locke’s separation of powers, and subordinated
all government to the legislature; but his doctrine had aimed to check
the executive, and that aim was completely achieved. Much of his trust
in human reasonable- ness and decency, and his moderation in applying
theory to practice, became standard procedure in English politics,
making revolution im- perceptible while real.</p>
<p>From England the ideas of Locke passed to France with Voltaire in</p>
<p>1729; they were taken up by Montesquieu on his visit to England
in</p>
<p>1729-3 1; they found voice in Rousseau and others before and during
the French Revolution, and appeared in full blast in the Constituent
Assembly’s</p>

<p>583</p>
<p>Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. When the American colonists
rebelled against the resurgent monarchy of George III, they adopted the
ideas, the formulas, almost the words, of Locke to express their
Declaration of Independence. The rights that Locke had vindicated became
the Bill of Rights in the first ten amendments to the American
Constitution. His separation of governmental powers, as extended to the
judiciary by Montesquieu, became a living factor in the American form of
government; his solicitude for property passed into American
legislation; his essays on toleration influenced the founding fathers in
separating Church from state and decreeing religious liberty. Rarely in
the history of political philosophy has one man had such lasting
influence.</p>

<li>Mind and Matter</li>
</ol>
<p>Locke’s influence was as extensive a nd profound in psychology as in
the theory of government. He had been writing the Essay concerning Human
Understanding since 1670; characteristically he sent it to the printer
only after twenty years of revision; and then, for this masterpiece of
psychological analysis, he received thirty pounds. He himself ascribed
the inception of the Essay to a conversation in London in 1670:</p>
<p>Five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and discoursing on a</p>
<p>subject very remote from this, found themselves quickly at a stand,
by the difficulties that rose on every side. After we had a while
puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a solution of those doubts
. . . it came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course, and that
before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary
to</p>
<p>examine our own abilities, and see what objects our understandings
were, or were not, fitted to deal with. This I proposed to the com-</p>
<p>pany, who all readily assented; and thereupon it was agreed that this
should be our first inquiry. Some hasty and undigested thoughts . . .
which I set down against our next meeting gave the first entrance into
this discourse. 127</p>
<p>Apparently the stimulus to the Essay was the contention of the Cam-
bridge Platonists — who here followed the Scholastic philosophers — that
we derive our ideas of God and morality not from experience but from
introspection, and that these ideas are innate with us, part of our
mental equipment, however unconscious, at our birth. This view, rather
than Descartes’ incidental statements on “innate ideas,” led Locke to
consider whether there were any ideas whatever that were not the result
of im- pressions from the external world. 128 Locke came to the
conclusion that</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXall knowledge- — including our ideas of God and right and wrong —
is de- rived from out experience, and is not part of the inborn
structure of the mind. He knew that in arguing for this empirical
position he would offend many of his contemporaries, who felt that
morality required the support of religion, and that both morality and
religion would be weakened if their basic ideas had any less noble
origin than God Himself. He asked his readers to be patient with him;
and for his own part he approached the dangerous discussion in a spirit
of modest uncertainty. “I pretend not to teach, but to inquire.” 129 He
spoke quietly, moderately, leisurely. And he confessed that he was “too
lazy, and too busy,” to be brief. 130</p>
<p>But at least he would define his terms. He protests against the
“affected</p>
<p>He begins by rejecting “innate principles.” “It is an established
opinion, amongst some men, that there are in the understanding certain
innate principles, some primary notions . . . stamped upon the mind of
man, which the soul receives in its very first being, and brings into
the world with it.” He proposes to show “the falseness of this
supposition.” 135 He does not deny innate tendencies — what were later
called tropisms, reflexes, or instincts; but these, in his view, are
physiological habits, not ideas. Fol- lowing Hobbes, he describes such
processes as “trains of motion in the animal spirits, which, once set
going, continue in the steps they have been used to, which, by often
treading, are worn into a smooth path, and the motion in it becomes
easy, and as it were natural” or inborn. 136 He is inclined to reduce
the associations of ideas to such physiological paths.</p>

<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>585</p>
<p>Descartes had supposed that the idea of God is innate in us; Locke
denies this. Some tribes have been found without it, and those that
profess it have such different conceptions and images of the deity that
it is wiser to reject the notion of innateness, and rest our belief in
God upon “the visible marks of extraordinary wisdom and power … in all
the works of crea- tion” 137 — i.e., upon experience. Likewise there are
“no innate practical principles” — no inborn conceptions of right and
wrong; history shows so great, sometimes so contradictory, a variety of
moral judgments that they cannot be a part of man’s natur al
inheritance; they are a social inheritance, differing from place to
place and from time to time . 138</p>
<p>Having disposed of innate ideas, Locke proceeds to inquire how ideas
are generated. “Let us then suppose the mind 〔at birth〕 to be, as we
say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas; how comes
it to be furnished? … To this we answer in one word, from experience; in
that all our knowledge is founded, and from that it ultimately derives
itself .” 139 All ideas are derived either from sensation or from
reflection on the products of sensation. Sensations themselves are
physical; their mental re- sult is perception, which is “the first
faculty of the mind .” 140</p>
<p>Locke saw no reason to doubt that we can have true or valid knowledge
of the external world, but he accepted the long-established distinction
be- tween the primary and secondary qualities of objects perceived.
Primary qualities are “such as are utterly inseparable from the body, in
what state</p>
<p>The analysis of an object into qualities led to the question, What is
the substance in which the primary qualities seem to inhere? Locke
confessed that we know nothing of that mysterious substratum except its
qualities; take these away, and the substance — the underlying ground of
the quali- ties — loses all meaning, apparently all existence . 141
Berkeley entered here.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXIf we know only the qualities of objects, and know these only as
ideas, then all reality is perception; and Locke, the great champion of
empiricism — of experience as the source of all knowledge — becomes an
idealist, re- ducing matter to idea. Moreover, the “mind” is as
suppostitious as substance, body, or matter. In a remarkable passage
Locke overleaps Berkeley and anticipates Hume:</p>
<p>The same thing happens concerning the operations of the mind,</p>
<p>viz. thinking, reasoning, fearing, etc., which we, concluding not
to</p>
<p>subsist of themselves, nor apprehending how they can belong to body
or be produced by it, are apt to think the actions of some other sub-
stance, which we call spirit, whereby yet it is evident that, having no
other idea or notion of matter but something wherein those many</p>
<p>sensible qualities which affect our senses do subsist, 〔so〕 by
supposing a substance wherein thinking, knowing, doubting, and a power
of</p>
<p>moving, etc., do subsist, we have as clear a notion of spirit as we
have of body: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it
is)</p>
<p>the substratum to those simple ideas we have derived from without;
and the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the
substratum to those operations we experiment 〔experience〕 in our-
selves within . 142</p>
<p>Admitting, then, that “our idea of substance is equally obscure, or
none at all, in both” worlds, and that “it is but a supposed I know not
what to support those ideas we call accidents,” Locke concludes that in
both cases we are warranted in believing in a substance, though we
cannot know it: in a matter behind and emitting the sensory qualities,
and in a mind behind and possessing the ideas — a spiritual agent
performing the various operations of perceiving, thinking, feeling, and
willing . 143</p>
<p>Whatever the mind is, its operations are all of one land — the play
of ideas. Locke rejects the Scholastic notion of “faculties” in the
mind, such as thought, feeling, and will. Thought is the combination of
ideas, feeling is the physiological reverberation of an idea; will is an
idea flowing into action, as all ideas tend to do unless checked by
another idea.* But how can an idea become an action — how can a
“spiritual” process become a physiological process and a physical
motion? Locke reluctantly accepts the dualism of corporeal body and
incorporeal mind; but in an imprudent moment he suggests that “mind”
might be a form of “matter.” This is a locus classicus in Locke:</p>
<p>Possibly we shall never be able to know whether any mere material
being thinks or no; it being impossible for us, by the contemplation</p>
<p>• In the first edition of the Essay Locke admitted no “free will”
except as freedom fro m external restraint. In later editions he
modified this determinism to ailow that the mind can suspend the
execution and satisfaction of its desires . 144</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>of our own ideas, without revelation, to discover whether Omnipo-</p>
<p>tency has not given to some systems of matter, fitly disposed, a
power to perceive and think, or else joined and fixed to matter, so
disposed, a thinking immaterial substance; it being, in respect of our
notions, not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that
God</p>
<p>can, if He pleases, superadd to matter a faculty of thinking, than
that He should add to it another substance with a faculty of thinking. .
. .</p>
<p>He that considers how hardly sensation is, in our thoughts, reconcil-
able to extended matter, or existence to anything that has no extension
at all, will confess that he is very far from certainly knowing what</p>
<p>his soul is. . . . He who will give himself leave to consider freely
. . .</p>
<p>will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or
against the soul’s materiality. 145</p>
<p>Though Hobbes had already leaped upon the materialistic horn of the
dilemma, the suggestion of its possible truth was, in the intellectual
con- text of Locke’s time, so offensive to orthodoxy that a hundred
defenders of religion attacked him as playing recklessly into the hands
of the atheists. They paid little attention to his passing obeisance to
revelation, or to his earlier stat ement that “the more probable opinion
is that consciousness is annexed to, and the affection of, one
individual immaterial substance.” 146 Perhaps they foresaw how La
Mettrie, d’Holbach, Diderot, and other ma - terialists would see in
Locke’s suggestion a secret inclination to their view. Bishop
Stillingfleet accused him of precisely such a tendency, and warned him
that it endangered the whole Christian theology. Forgetting his usual
caution, Locke warmly reasserted the possibility of the material
hypothesis, in a controversy that lasted, with Stillingfleet and others,
till 1697.</p>
<p>Despite its critics, its occasional contradictions, obscurities, and
other faults, the Essay gathered prestige and influence with every year.
Four editions of it were called for in the fourteen years between its
publication and Locke’s death. A French edition appeared in 1700, and
was greeted with enthusiastic admiration. It became a topic in English
drawing rooms; Tristram Shandy assured his hearers that a reference to
the Essay would enable anyone to cut “no contemptible figure in a
metaphysical circle.” 147 The influence of the Essay on Berkeley and
Hume was so great that we might date from it the turn of British
philosophy from metaphysics to epistemology. Perhaps Pope had Locke in
mind when he wrote that “the proper study of mankind is man.”</p>
<p>A French edition appeared in 1700, and was greeted with enthusiastic
hyperboles. “After so many speculative gentlemen had formed the
romance</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXveloped the human understanding in a book where there is nothing
but truths, a book made perfect by the fact that these truths are
stated</p>
<p>clearly.” 149 The Essay became the psychological bible of the French
En - lightenment. Condillac adopted and extended Locke’s sensationism,
and thought nothing had been done in psychology between Aristotle and
Locke 150 — a manifest injustice to the Scho lastics and Hobbes.
D’Alembert, in the discours preliminaire of the Encyclopedic , credited
Locke with having created scientific philosophy as Newton (he supposed)
had created scientific physics. Despite its professions of orthodoxy,
the Essay made for a rationalistic empiricism that soon discarded the
soul as a needless hypothesis, and passed on to apply the same reasoning
to God.</p>
<p>4 . Religion and Toleration</p>
<p>Locke himself had no sympathy with such extremes. Whatever his</p>
<p>private doubts, he felt, like an English gentleman, that good manners
and morals required public support of the Christian church. If
philosophy should take from the people their faith in a divine justice
standing behind the apparent injustices and sufferings of life, what
could it offer to sustain the hopes and courage of men? A slow progress
toward a democratic utopia? But in that utopia would not the natural
greed and inequality of men forge new means for the use and abuse of the
simple or the weak by the clever or the strong?</p>
<p>His first concern was to “lay down the measures and boundaries be -
tween faith and reason”; and this he aimed to do in Chapter 18 of Book
IV of the Essay. “I find every sect, as far as reason will help them,
make use of it gladly; and where it fails them, they cry out, It is a
matter of faith, and above reason.” 161 “Whatever God hath revealed is
certainly true,” 152 but only reasoning on the available evidence can
tell us whether a scripture is the word of God, and “no proposition can
be received for divine revela - tion if it be contrary to our clear
intuitive knowledge.” 153 When a matter</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>589</p>
<p>the love of truth is “not entertaining any proposition with greater
assurance than the proofs it is built upon will warrant .” 156 “Reason
must be our last judge and guide in everything .” 167</p>
<p>So, in 1695, Locke published The Reasonableness of Christianity
as</p>
<p>Delivered in the Scriptures. He read the New Testament again, as one
might read a new book, putting aside (as he thought) all dogmas and
commentaries. He was overwhelmed by the lovable nobility of Christ, and
the beauty of nearly all his teaching as the best and brightest hope of
man- kind. If anything could be a divine revelation, this narrative and
doctrine seemed divine. Locke proposed to accept it as divine, but also
to prove it, in all its essentials, to be in the profoundest agreement
with reason.</p>
<p>But those essentials, it seemed to him, were far more modest and
simple than the complex theology of the Thirty-nine Articles, the
Westminster Confession, or the Athanasian Creed. He quoted passage after
passage from the New Testament requiring of a Christian only the belief
in God and in Christ as his divine messenger or Messiah. Here, said
Locke, is a plain and intelligible religion, fit for any man, and
independent of all learn- ing and theology. As to the existence of God,
he felt that “the works of nature in every part of them sufficiently
evidence a Deity”; 158 from his own existence he argued to a First
Cause; and since he found perception and knowledge in himself, he
concluded that such attributes must also belong to God; God is “eternal
Mind .” 159 When Locke’s critics complained that he had left out such
vital doctrines as the immortality of the soul and everlasting
punishments and rewards, he replied that in accepting Christ he accepted
Christ’s teachings, in which those doctrines were included. So Locke
came out by the same door wherein he went.</p>
<p>However, he insisted that all forms of Christianity except
Catholicism should enjoy full liberty in England. He had written an
essay on toleration as early as 1666. When he moved to Holland (1683) he
found much more freedom of worship than in England; and while he was
there he must have noted Bayle’s powerful defense of toleration (1686).
Moved by the perse - cution and migration of the Huguenots (1685), he
wrote a letter to his friend Limborch, who urged its publication; it was
printed in Latin in 1689 as Epistola de Toler antia, and appeared in an
English translation before the year was out. An Oxford don denounced it;
Locke, now in England, de- fended it in a second and third Letter
concerning Toleration (1690, 1692). The Toleration Act of 1689 fell far
short of his proposals; it excluded Cath- olics, Unitarians, Jews, and
pagans, and barred Dissenters from public af- fairs. Locke also made
exceptions: he would not tolerate atheists, because he thought their
word could not be trusted, since they feared no God; or any religion
that did physical harm, as by human sacrifice; or any religion demanding
allegiance to a foreign power; he gave Mohammedanism as an</p>
<p>59©</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXexample, but was understood to mean Catholicism too. 160 He
explicitly called for toleration of Presbyterians, Independents,
Anabaptists, Armin- ians, and Quakers. He did not dare include
Unitarians, though the first Shaftesbury, dying in Amsterdam (1683),
said he had imbibed Arianism and Socinianism (Unitarianism) from his
secretary Locke. 161</p>
<p>The law, said Locke, should concern itself only with the preservation
of social order; it has a right to suppress expressions destructive of
the state, but i t has no jurisdiction over men’s souls. No church
should have the power to compel adherence. How ridiculous to punish
persons in Denmark for not being Lutherans, in Geneva for not being
Calvinists, in Vienna for not being Catholics! After all, which
individual or group can have the full truth about human life and
destiny? Locke noted that most of the religions demanded toleration when
they were weak, but refused it when they were strong. Persecution, he
felt, comes from lust for power, and from jealousy masquerading as
religious zeal. Persecution creates hypocrites, toleration promotes
knowledge and truth. And how can a Christian persecute, being pledged to
charity?</p>
<p>Locke continued his campaign for toleration till the close of his
life.</p>
<p>He was engaged in writing a fourth letter on the subject when his
time ran out. Death came to him (1704) while he sat quietly listening to
Lady Masham reading Psalms.</p>
<p>Even before his death he had reached in philosophy a reputation sur-
passed only by Newton’s in science; men already spoke of him as “ the
philosopher.” While he ended in almost orthodox piety, his books, unable
to change with age, passed through editions and translations into the
thought of educated Europe. “The Western Enlightenment,” said Spengler,
“is of English origin. The rationalism of the Continent comes wholly
from Locke.” 162 Of course not wholly. But of whom else would one now
risk such hyperbole?</p>

Shaftes- bury’s style; the explorative psychologist wrote a pedestrian
prose, simple and usually clear (this side the stake), but seldom
beautiful; Shaftesbury, a man of wealth and leisure, wrote with
confident urbanity, tolerant humor, and almost Gallic grace — the
English seigneur condescending to be a phi- losopher. We must stay with
him a while, for he almost founded aesthetics in modern philosophy, and,
by rescuing feeling and sympathy from the cold hands of Hobbes and
Locke, fed the stream of sentiment that culmi- nated in Rousseau.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>591</p>
<p>Under Locke’s supervision, and on Locke’s scheme of teaching a
language by conversation, Elizabeth Birch, skilled in Greek and Latin,
enabled</p>
<p>Anthony to read both these languages with ease by the age of eleven.
Then off to Winchester School; then three years of travel, during which
he learned French and French ways, and acquired such a flair for art as
must have seemed unseemly in an English lord. He served for a year in
Parlia- ment — long enough to note “the injustice and corruption of both
par - ti es”; 103 but London smoke so aggravated his asthma that he
retreated to Holland, where he found the intellectual air vibrant with
Spinoza and Bayle. Having succeeded to the earldom (1699), he spent the
remainder of his life at his country estate. Four years before his death
he married, and was astonished to find himself as happy as before. 164
In 17 11 he published his collected essays under the omnibus title
Characteristics of Men, Man- ners, Opinions, and Times. In 1713, only
forty-two years old, he died.</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that a man who had inherited such a fortune
on the earth should bother much about heaven. He deprecated the “en -
thusiasm” — by which his time meant fanaticism — of those Englishmen who
thought that they exhaled divine revelations. Any form of violent
emotion or speech was in his judgment a mark of ill-breeding. But he
thought it wiser to smile at such people than to persecute them; indeed,
wit and humor, which he made the subject of an originative essay,
appeared to him the best approach to everything, even to theology. He
agreed with Bayle that atheists could be decent citizens, and that they
had done less harm to religion and morality than the brutality of faiths
wielding power. 168 He protested against “the adoration and love of a
God whose character it is to be captious and of high resentment, subject
to wrath and anger, furious and revengeful . . . , encouraging deceit
and treachery amongst men, favorable to a few . . . and cruel t o the
rest.” 166 He wondered what effect such a conception of the deity had
had upon human character and conduct. He thought it abject and cowardly
to be virtuous from hope of heaven or fear of hell; virtue is real only
when practiced for its own sake. However, man being what he is, it is
necessary to inculcate belief in such future pun- ishments and rewards.
167 “ ’Tis real humanity and kindness to hide strong truths from tender
eyes. … It may be necessary . . . for wise men to speak in parables.”
168 So Shaftesbury defended an established church, and tried to
reconcile evil and theism with an optimistic philosophy that reduced
evil to a human prejudice. 169 Nevertheless Alexander Pope thought that
the Characteristics had done more harm to revealed religion in England
than all the works of explicit infidels. 170</p>
<p>Shaftesbury agreed with Aristotle and Locke that happiness is the
right- ful aim of human actions; he defined philosophy as “the study of
happi - ness.” 171 But he opposed the reducti on of all human motives to
egoism or</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXself-interest. According to that analysis (recently expounded by
Hobbes and La Rochefoucauld),</p>
<p>civility, hospitality, humanity towards strangers or people in
dis-</p>
<p>tress, is only a more deliberate selfishness. An honest heart is only
a more cunning one; and honesty and good nature a . . . better regulated
self-love. The love of kindred, children, and posterity is purely
love</p>
<p>of self and one’s own immediate blood. . . . Magnanimity and courage,
no doubt, are modifications of this universal self-love ! 172</p>
<p>Against this view Shaftesbury alleged the double equipment of human
nature with instincts for personal gain and instincts for living in a
group. He believed that society and the state had originated not in a
social contract but in the “herding principle and associating
inclination … so natural and strong in most men .” 173 There are
“natural affections . . . founded in love, complacency, goodwill, and
sympathy with the kind. … To have these natural and good affections in
full strength is to have the chief means of self- enjoyment; to want
them is certain misery and ill .” 174 To be “good” is to have one’s
inclinations consistently directed toward the g ood of the group: the
larger the group that inspires these feelings, the better the man. The
consciousness of such social sympathy is the moral sense. This is
innate, not in its specific commands (which vary from group to group),
but in its instinctive ground, “the sense of right and wrong . . . being
as natural to us as natural affection itself, and being a first
principle in our constitution.” 17 ®</p>
<p>Shaftesbury passed from ethics to aesthetics by identifying them. The
good an d the beautiful are one: morality is “the taste of beauty and
the relish of what is decent”; so we speak of some unsocial acts as
ugly, for we feel that they offend that harmony of the part with the
whole which is both goodness and beauty. A man can make his life a work
of art — of unity and harmony — by developing an aesthetic sense in
which morality will be an element; a man “of thorough good breeding”
(our aristocrat be - lieved) does this, and is by training “incapable of
doing a rude or brutal ac tion”; 176 his formed good taste will guide
him in conduct as in art. Truth too is a kind of beauty, a harmony of
the parts of knowledge with the whole. Hence Shaftesbury took readily
the side of classicism in art: form, unity, and harmony seemed to him
the essentials of excellence in poetry, architecture, and sculpture; and
in painting color is less basic and noble than line. He was the first
modern who made beauty a fundamental prob- lem in philosophy; he began
the discussion that at the end of the eighteenth century culminated in
Lord Karnes and Burke.</p>
<p>This was one line of Shaftesbury’s influence; there were many others.
His emphasis on feeling affected the romantic movement, especially in
Ger-</p>

<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>593</p>
<p>many through Lessing, Schiller, Goethe, and Herder — who called him
“Europe’s amiable Plato.” 177 In France this influence appeared in
Diderot as well as in Rousseau. His interpretation of religion as
theoretically weak but morally indispensable touched Kant’s practical
nerve. His stress on sympathy as the basis of morals reappeared in Hume
and Adam Smith. His ideas on art shared in forming Winckelmann’s
classical ecstasy. Beginning as a pupil of the intellectual and not too
aesthetic Locke, he became (per- haps by the natural resistance of every
generation to its generators) the philosopher of feeling, sentiment, and
beauty. Lover of the classic style in art, he became a source of the
romantic revival on the Continent, though in England poetry and
architecture followed his classic bent. And he had the distinction of
making philosophy shine with a grace of style reminiscent of Plato, and
then rivaled only by Berkeley.</p>

<li>GEORGE BERKELEY: 1685-1753</li>
</ol>
<p>He was born at Dysert Castle in County Kilkenny. At fifteen he
entered Trinity College, Dublin. At twenty he formed a club to study
“the new philosophy,” which meant Locke. At twenty -one he entered into
his “commonplace book” the idea which, he hoped, would crush materialism
forever: that nothing exists except by being perceived, that therefore
mind is the only reality, and matter is a myth.</p>
<p>As . . . the doctrine of matter, or corporeal substance 〔has
been〕</p>
<p>the main pillar and support of skepticism, so likewise upon the same
faith have been raised all the impious schemes of atheism and
irreligion.</p>
<p>. . . How great a friend material substance hath been to atheists in
all ages, were needless to relate. All their monstrous systems have
so</p>
<p>visible and necessary a dependence on it, that when this cornerstone
is once removed, the whole fabric cannot choose but fall to the</p>
<p>ground; insomuch that it is no longer worth while to bestow a
par-</p>
<p>ticular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect
of</p>
<p>atheists. 178</p>
<p>So in the next seven years, and before completing his
twenty-ninth</p>
<p>birthday, Berkeley issued his most important works: An Essay towards
a New Theory of Vision (1709), A Treatise concerning the Principles of
Human Knowledge (1710), and Three Dialogues between Hylas and</p>
<p>Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists (1713). The first
was a brilliant contribution to psychology and optics; the others
profoundly stirred the waters of modem philosophy.</p>
<p>The essay on vision stemmed from a passage in Locke, 179 which
told</p>
<p>594</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhow William Molyneux (a tutor in Trinity College, Dublin) had posed
a problem to him: Would a man bom blind be able, on recovering his
sight, to distinguish by sight alone a sphere from a cube if both of
these were of like material and size? Molyneux and Locke had concurred
in the negative; Berkeley agreed with them and added his own analysis.
Sight gives us no perception of the distance, size, relative positions,
or movements of objects, except after correction by the sense of touch;
through repeated experiences this correction becomes almost
instantaneous; and sight then gives us such a judgment of the shape,
distance, place, and motion of ob- jects seen as we should have if we
touched them.</p>
<p>A man born blind, being made to see, would at first have no idea
of</p>
<p>distance by sight; the sun and stars, the remotest objects as well as
the nearer, would all seem to be in his eye, or rather in his mind.
The</p>
<p>objects intromitted by sight would seem to him (as in truth they are)
no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations, each whereof is as
near to him as the perception of pain or pleasure or the most inward
passions of the soul. For our judging objects perceived by sight to be
at any distance, or without the mind, is entirely the effect of experi-
ence. 180</p>
<p>Space, then, is a mental construct; it is a system of relationships
built up in the course of experience to co-ordinate our perceptions of
sight and touch. Operations reported by the Royal Society (1709, 1728)
confirmed this view: when a congenitally blind person was surgically
given sight, he was at first “so far from making an y judgment about
distances that he thought all objects whatever touched his eyes. . . .
He knew not the shape of anything, nor any one thing from another,
however different in shape or magnitude.” 181</p>
<p>The Principles of Human Knowledge was a remarkable product for a lad
of twenty- five. Again Berkeley took a leap out of Locke’s Essay. If all
knowledge comes from the senses, nothing has reality for us unless we
per- ceive or have perceived it; esse est percipi — to be is to be
perceived. Locke had supposed that perceptions were caused by external
objects pressing upon our sense organs. How do you know, asked Berkeley,
that</p>
<p>such objects exist? Have we not in our dreams ideas as vivid as in
our waking hours? Locke tried to save the independent reality of objects
by distinguishing between their primary and secondary qualities: the
latter were subjective, “in the mind”; the others — extension, solidity,
figure, number, motion, rest — were objective; they subsisted in some
mysterious substratum of which Locke confessed himself ignorant, but
which he and the world identified with “matter.” Berkeley now announced
that the primary qualities are as subjective as the secondary; that we
know the extension, solidity, figure, number, motion, and rest of
objects only</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>through perception; that therefore these primary qualities too are
subjec- tive, are ideas. The world is for us just a bundle of
perceptions. “It is the mind that frames all that variety of bodies
which compose the visible world, any one whereof does not exist longer
than it is perceived .” 182 Take away from “matter” the primary as well
as the secondary qualities, and “matter” becomes a meaningless non
entity. The materialist is left mouthing nothings . 183</p>
<p>Berkeley was well aware that others besides materialists would
protest against this sleight-of-hand evaporation of the external world.
He was not at a loss when asked if the furniture in our rooms ceases to
exist when no one is there to perceive it . 184 He did not deny the
reality of an external world, an external source for our perceptions ;
185 he merely denied the materiality of that world. External objects may
continue to exist when we do not perceive them, but that is only because
they exist as percepts in the mind of God . 186 And in truth (he went
on) our sensations are caused not by external matter, but by the divine
power acting upon our senses Only spirit can act upon spirit; God is the
sole source of our sensations and ideas. 187 *</p>
<p>Berkeley’s contemporaries thought this was all an Irish lark. Lord
Ches - terfield wrote to his son that</p>
<p>Doctor Berkeley, a very worthy, ingenious, and learned man, has</p>
<p>written a book to prove that there is no such thing as matter, and
that nothing exists but an idea. . . . His arguments are, strictly
speaking,</p>
<p>unanswerable; but yet I am so far from being convinced by them that I
am determined to go on to eat and drink, and walk and ride, in order to
keep that matter, which I so mistakenly imagine my body at present to
consist of, in as good plight as possible . 188</p>
<p>And all the world knows what pains Dr. Johnson took to answer Dr.</p>
<p>Berkeley:</p>
<p>After we came out of church 〔says Boswell〕 we stood talking for</p>
<p>some time together of Bishop Berkeley’s ingenious sophistry to prove
the non-existence of matter, and that everything in the universe is</p>
<p>merely ideal. I observed that though we are satisfied his doctrine is
not true, it is impossible to refute it. I shall never forget the
alacrity with which Johnson answered, strikihg his foot with mighty
force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, “I refute it
thus!” 189</p>
<p>Berkeley, of course, would have pointed out to the Great Cham that
all that he knew of the stone, including the pain in his toe, was
subjective: a bundle of perceptions called a stone, mingling with a
bundle of auditory</p>

<p>596</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXsensations called Boswell and a bundle of indoctrinated ideas
called philos- ophy, had generated a response resulting in another
bundle of sensations. Hume agreed with Boswell and Chesterfield:
Berkeley’s arguments “admit of no answer and produce no conviction.”
190</p>
<p>Hume found Berkeley’s puzzle fascina ting, but drew from it a
devastat- ing conclusion. He admitted that “matter” vanishes when we
divest it of all the qualities which our perceptions ascribe to it, but
he suggested that the same could be said of “mind.” We have seen Locke’s
preview of thi s point; but Berkeley foresaw it, too. In the third of
the Dialogues he makes Hylas challenge Philonous:</p>
<p>You acknowledge you have, properly speaking, no idea of your own
soul. … You admit, nevertheless, that there is a spiritual
substance,</p>
<p>although you have no idea of it; while you deny there can be such a
thing as material substance, because you have no notion or idea of
it.</p>
<p>Is this fair dealing? … To me it seems that according to your own</p>
<p>way of thinking, and in consequence of your own principles, it should
follow that you are only a system of floating ideas, without any sub-
stance to support them. Words are not to be used without a meaning.</p>
<p>And as there is no more meaning in spiritual substance than in
material substance, the one is to be exploded as well as the other.
191</p>
<p>Philonous (lover of mind) answers Hylas (Mr. Matter) :</p>
<p>How often must I repeat, that I know or am conscious of my own</p>
<p>being; and that I myself and not my ideas, but somewhat else, a
think- ing, active principle that perceives, knows, wills, and operates
about ideas? I know that I, one and the same self, perceive both colors
and sounds; that a color cannot perceive a sound, nor a sound a
color;</p>
<p>that I am therefore one individual principle, distinct from color
and</p>
<p>sound. 192</p>
<p>Hume was not convinced by this reply; he concluded that Berkeley,
willy- nilly, had destroyed both matter and soul, and that the writings
of the brilliant bishop, who had longed to defend religion, “form the
best lessons of skepticism which are to be found either among the
ancient or modem philosophers, Bayle not excepted.” 193</p>
<p>Forty years remained to Berkeley after publishing his three
treatises. In 1724 he was appointed dean of Derry. In 1728, on a promise
of funds from the government, he sailed to found a college in Bermuda
for “the reforma - tion of manners among the English in our western
plantations, and the propagation of the Gospel among the American
savages.” 194 Having reached Newport, Rhode Island, he waited for the
promised twenty thou- sand pounds, none of which ever came. While there
he composed Alci-</p>

<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>597</p>
<p>phron, or The Minute Philosopher (1732), to put an end to all
religious doubt. He left his mark upon the mind of Jonathan Edwards, and
wrote a famous line: “Westward the course of empire takes its way.”
After three years of vain expectations he returned to England. In 1734
he was appointed bishop of Cloyne. We have seen how Swift’s Vanessa made
him one of her executors, and left him half her property. In 1744 he
issued a strange treatise, Siris, . . . the Virtues of Tar-Water — to
which he had been intro- duced by the aforesaid savages, and which he
now recommended as a cure for smallpox. He died at Oxford in 1753, aged
sixty-eight.</p>
<p>No man ever surpassed him in proving the unreality of the real. In
his effort to restore religious belief, and to exorcise the Hobbesian
materialism that was infecting England, he turned philosophy outside in,
and made “all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth, … all
those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world,” 195 to exist
for man as merely ideas in his mind. It was a risky enterprise, and
Berkeley would have shud- dered to see Hume and Kant draw from his pious
principles a critique of reason that left no basic dogma undislodged in
the ancient and beloved edifice of the Christian faith. We admire the
subtlety of his web-weaving, and concede that no one since Plato had
written nonsense so charmingly. We shall find his influence everywhere
in Britain and Germany in the eighteenth century, less in France, but
rising again in the epistemological abracadabra of nineteenth-century
Kantians. Even today European philos- ophy has not yet quite made up its
mind that the external world exists. Until it reconciles itself to the
extreme probability thereof, and faces the problems of life and death,
the world will pass it by.</p>
<p>All in all, this was the finest epoch in the history of English
philosophy. The bell that Francis Bacon had rung to call the wits
together had been heard after the subsiding fury of the Civil War.
Hobbes was the bridge over that mindless void, Newton was the lever by
which mechanics moved theology, Locke was the peak from which the
problems of modern philos- ophy came clearly into view. From that
English quartet, soon abetted by the canny, uncanny Hume, came a
powerful influence into France and Germany. The French thinkers of this
period were not so profound or original as the English, but more
brilliant, partly because they were Gauls, partly because a more
stringent censorship compelled them to spend their substance upon form
and dispense their wisdom in wit. Then in 1726 Voltaire came to England.
When he returned he carried Newton, Locke, Bacon, Hobbes, and other
contraband in his bags; and France for half a century thereafter used
English science and philosophy as weapons to e eraser V inf Arne of
superstition, obscurantism, and ignorance. An English midwife served at
the accouchement of the French Enlightenment.</p>
