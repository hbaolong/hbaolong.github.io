<h4 id="chapter-viii-the-western-slavs">CHAPTER VIII The Western
Slavs</h4>
<p>1300-1517</p>
<p>I. BOHEMIA</p>
<p>H ERETOFORE the Slavs had been human flotsam, surging westward at
times to the Elbe, southward to the Mediterranean, eastward to</p>
<p>he Urals, north even to the Arctic Sea; then, in the thirteenth
century, re- pulsed in the west by the Livonian and Teutonic knights,
and subjected to Mongol and Tatar domination in the east. In the
fourteenth century Bohemia led the Holy Roman Empire and the
pre-Lutheran Reformation; and Poland, united with a vast Lithuania,
became a major power, with a highly cultured upper class. In the
fifteenth century Russia freed herself from the Tatars, and unified her
far-flung principalities into a massive state. Like a tidal wave, the
Slavs entered history.</p>
<p>In 1306 the death of Wenceslaus III ended the ancient Przemyslid line
in Bohemia. After an interlude of minor kings the baronial and
ecclesiastical electors brought in John of Luxembourg to found a new
dynasty (1310). His gallant adventures made Bohemia for a generation an
unwilling citadel of chivalry. He could hardly live without toumanlents,
and when these proved too innocuous he sallied forth to war in almost
every realm of Eu- rope. It became a bon mot of the times that “nothing
can be done without the help of God and the King of Bohe mia.” 1
Brescia, besieged by Verona, begged his aid; he promised to come; at the
news thereof the Veronese raised the siege. Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona,
Parma, Modena, even Milan voluntarily acknowledged him as their feudal
sovereign in return for his protection; what Frederick I Barbarossa and
Frederick II Wonder of the World had been unable to secure by arms, this
King obtained almost by the magic of his name. His dashing wars added
terrain to Bohemia but forfeited the affection of the people, who could
not forgive him for being so often absent from their country that he
neglected its administration and never learned its speech. In 1 3 36, on
a crusade in Lithuania, he contracted a disease that left him blind.
Nevertheless, when he learned that Edward III of Eng- land had landed in
Normandy and was moving toward Paris, John and his son Charles, with 500
Bohemian knights, rode across Europe to succor the king of France.
Father and son fought in the van at Crecy. When the French</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>l6* THE REFORMATION (CHAP.vni</p>
<p>retreated, the blind King bade two knights bind their horses on
either side to his and lead him against the victorious English, saying,
“So will it God, it shall not be said that a king of Bohemia flies from
the battlefield.” Fifty of his knights were killed around him; he was
mortally wounded, and was taken, dying, to the tent of the English King.
Edward sent the corpse to Charles with a courtly message: “This day has
fallen the crown of chivalry.” 2</p>
<p>Charles IV was a less heroic but much wiser king. He preferred
negoti- ation to war, and was not too cowardly to compromise; yet he
extended the boundaries of his kingdom. In the thirty-two years of his
reign he kept the Slavs and the Germans in unwonted peace. He
reorganized the government, reformed the judiciary, and made Prague one
of the handsomest cities in Europe. He built there a royal residence on
the style of the Louvre, and the famous castle o f Karlstein (Charles’s
Stone) as a repository for the archives of the state and the jewels of
the crown — which were treasured not for vanity and display but as a
reserve fund conveniently mobile and immune to de- basements of the
currency. He brought in Matthew of Arras to design St. Vitus’ Cathedral,
and Tommaso da Modena to paint frescoes in churches and palaces. He
protected the peasantry from oppression, and promoted com- merce and
industry. He founded the University of Prague (1347), trans- mitted to
his countrymen the cultural interest that he had acquired in France and
Italy, and provided the intellectual stimulus that exploded in the
Hussite revolt. His court became the center of the Bohemian humanists,
led by Bishop John of Stresa, Petrarc h’s friend. The Italian poet
admired Charles beyond any other monarch of the time, visited him in
Prague, and begged him to conquer Italy; but Charles had better sense.
His reign, despite his Golden Bull, was Bohemia’s Golden Age. He
survives smiling, i n a splendid limestone bust, in the cathedral of
Prague.</p>
<p>Wenceslaus IV was a youth of eighteen when his father died ( 1 378).
His good nature, his affection for his people, his lenience in taxing,
them, his skill in administration, won him great favor with all but the
nobles, who thought their privileges imperiled by his popularity. His
occasional hot temper, and his addiction to drink, gave them a leverage
for displacing him. They sur- prised him at his country seat, threw him
into prison (1394), and restored him only on his promise to do nothing
of moment without the consent of a council of nobles and bishops. New
disputes arose; Sigismund of Hungary was called in; he arrested
Wenceslaus, his brother, and took him prisoner to Vienna ( 1402).
Wenceslaus escaped a few years later, made his way back to Bohemia, was
received with joy by the people, and regained his throne and powers. The
rest of his story mingles with the tragedy of Huss.</p>
<p>CHAP, vra)</p>
<p>THE WESTERN SLAVS</p>
<p>163</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>JOHN huss: 1369-1415</li>
</ol>
<p>Wenceslaus was loved and hated for winking at heresy and scowling at
the Germans. A rapid infiltration of Bohemia by German miners,
craftsmen, merchants, and students had generated a racial hostility
between Teutons and Czechs; Huss would have received less support from
people and king had he not symbolized a native resentment of German
prominence. Wences- laus did not forget that the archbishops of Germany
had led the movement to depose him from the Imperial throne. His sister
Anne had married Richard II of England, and had seen — probably had
sympathized with — the attempt of Wyclif to divorce England from the
Roman Church. In 1388 Adelbert Ranconis left a sum to enable Bohemian
students to go to Paris or Oxford. Some of these in England secured or
transcribed works by Wyclif, and took them to Bohemia. Milic of Kromenze
and Conrad Waldhouser roused Prague with their denunciations of
immorality in laity and clergy; Matthias of Janov and Thomas of Stitny
continued this preaching; the Emperor, and even Archbishop Ernst,
approved; and in 1391 a special church, called the Bethlehem Chapel, was
founded in Prague to lead the movement of reform. In 1402 John Huss was
appointed to the pulpit of this chapel.</p>
<p>He had begun life in the village of Husinetz, and was known as
John</p>
<p>of Husinetz, which he later shortened to Hus. Toward 1390 he came as
a poor student to Prague, where he earned his way by serving in the
churches. He aimed to enter the priesthood; nevertheless, after the
custom of the age, he joined in what Paris would later term the gay
“Bohemian” ways of uni - versity youth. In 1 396 he received his degree
of master of arts, and began to teach at the university; in 1401 he was
chosen dean of the faculty of arts — i.e., of the “humanities.” In that
year he was ordained priest, and reformed his life to an almost monastic
austerity. As head of the Bethlehem Chapel he be- came the most famous
preacher in Prague. Many figures high in the court were among his
listeners, and Queen Sophia made him her chaplain. He preached in Czech,
and taught his congregation to take an active part in the service by
singing hymns.</p>
<p>His accusers later affirmed that in the very first year of his
ministry he had echoed Wyclif ’s doubts as to the disappearance of bread
and wine from the consecrated elements in the Eucharist. Unquestionably
he had read some of Wyclif’s works; he had ma de copies of them which
still exist with his an- notations; and at his trial he confessed to
having said: “Wyclif, I trust, will be saved; but could I think he would
be damned, I would my soul were with his.” 3 In 1403 the opinions of
Wyclif had won suc h vogue in the University of Prague that the chapter
— the administrative clergy — of the cathedral sub- mitted to the
university masters forty-five excerpts from the writings of</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Wyclif, and asked should these doctrines be barred from the
university. Sev- eral masters, including Huss, answered No; but the
majority ruled that there- after no member of the university staff
should, either publicly or privately, defend or adhere to any of the
forty-five articles.</p>
<p>Huss must have ignored this prohibition, for in 1408 the clergy of
Prague petitioned Archbishop Zbynek to reprove him. The Archbishop
proceeded cautiously, being then in conflict with the King. But when
Huss continued to express sympathy for Wyclif’s views Zbynek
excommunicated him and several associates ( 1409) ; and when they
persisted in exercising their priestly functions he placed all Prague
under an interdict. He ordered all writings of Wyclif that could be
found in Bohemia to be surrendered to him; 200 manu- scripts were
brought to him; he burned them in the courtyard of his palace. Huss
appealed to the newly elected Pope John XXIII. John summoned him to
appear before the papal court. He refused to go.</p>
<p>In 1 41 1 the Pope, desiring funds for a crusade against Ladislas,
King of Naples, announced a new offering of indulgences. When this was
proclaimed in Prague, and the papal agents seemed to the reformers to be
selling forgive- ness for coin, Huss and his chief supporter, Jerome of
Prague, publicly preached against indulgences, questioned the existence
of purgatory, and protested against the Church’s collecting money to
spill Christian blood. De - scending to vituperation, Huss called the
Pope a money-grubber, even Anti- christ. 4 A large section of the public
shared Huss’s views, and subjected the papal agents to such ridicule and
abuse that the King forbade any further preaching or action against the
offering of indulgences. Three youths who violated this edict were
hailed before the city council; Huss pleaded for them, and admitted that
his preaching had aroused them; they were con- demned and beheaded. The
Pope now launched his own excommunication against Huss; and when Huss
ignored it John laid an interdict upon any city where he should stay
(141 1). On the advice of the King, Huss left Prague, and remained in
rural seclusion for two years.</p>
<p>In those years he wrote his major works, some in Latin, some in
Czech, nearly all inspired by Wyclif, some perhaps echoing the heresies
and anti- clericalism that a remnant of the Waldensians had brought with
them into Bohemia in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. He rejected
image worship, auricular confession, and the multiplication of ornate
religious rites. He gave his movement a popular and nationalistic
character by denouncing the Ger- mans and defending the Slavs. In a
tract on Traffic in Holy Things he at- tacked the simony of the clergy;
in De sex erroribus he condemned the taking of fees by priests for
baptism, confirmation, Masses, marriages, or burials; he charged some
Prague clerics with selling consecrated oil; and he adopted Wyclif’s
view that a priest guilty of simony could not validly administer a
sacrament. 5 His treatise De ecclesia became his apologia and his ruin;
from its</p>
<p>THE WESTERN SLAVS</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>pages were drawn the heresies for which he was burned. He followed
Wyclif into predestinarianism, and agreed with Wyclif, Marsilius, and
Ockham that the Church should have no worldly goods. Like Calvin, he
defined the Church neither as the clergy nor as the whole body of
Christians, but as the totality, in heaven or on earth, of the saved. 6
Christ, not the pope, is the head of the Church; the Bible, not the
pope, should be the Christian’s guide. The pope is not infallible, even
in faith or morals; the pope himself may be a hard- ened sinner or
heretic. Accepting a legend widely credited at the time (even by
Gerson), Huss made much of a supposititious Pope John VIII who (said the
legend) had revealed her sex by giving unpremeditated birth to a child
on the streets of Rome. 7 A pope, Huss concluded, is to be obeyed only
when his commands conform to the law of Christ. “To r ebel against an
erring pope is to obey Christ.” 8</p>
<p>When a general council met at Constance in 1414 to depose three rival
popes and enact a program of ecclesiastical reform, a chance seemed open
to reconcile the Hussites with the Church. Emperor Sigismund, heir
apparent to the childless Wenceslaus IV, was anxious to restore
religious unity and peace in Bohemia. He suggested that Huss should go
to Constance and at- tempt a reconciliation. For this hazardous journey
he offered Huss a safe- conduct to Constance, a public hearing before
the Council, and a free and safe return to Bohemia in case Huss should
reject the judgment of the as- sembly. Despite the anxious warnings of
his associates, Huss set out for Constance (October 1414), escorted by
three Czech nobles and several friends. About the same time Stephen of
Palecz and other Bohemian op- ponents of Huss went to Constance to
indict him before the Council.</p>
<p>Arrived, he was at first treated courteously, and lived in freedom.
But when Palecz laid before the Council a list of Huss’s heresies, they
summoned and questioned him. Convinced by his replies that he was a
major heretic, they ordered him imprisoned. He fell ill, and was for a
time near death; Pope John XXIII sent papal physicians to treat him.
Sigismund complained that the action of the Council violated the
safe-conduct that he had given Huss; it answered that it was not bound
by his action; that his authority did not ex- tend to spiritual
concerns; that the Church had the right to overrule the state in trying
an enemy of the Church. In April Huss was removed to the fortress of
Gottlieben on the Rhine; there he was placed in fetters, and was so
poorly fed that he again fell gravely ill. Meanwhile his fellow heretic,
Jerome of Prague, had rashly entered Constance, and had nailed to the
city gates, to the doors of churches, and upon the houses of cardinals,
a request that the Emperor and the Council should give him a
safe-conduct and a public hear- ing. At the urging of Huss’s friends he
left the city and began a return to Bohemia; but on the way he stopped
to preach against the Council’s treat - ment of Huss. He was arrested,
brought back to Constance, and jailed.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>1 66</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>On July 5, after seven months of imprisonment, Huss was led in chains
before the Council, and again on the seventh and the eighth. Asked his
view of the forty- five articles already condemned in Wyclif’s works, he
rejected most of them, approved of some. Confronted with extracts from
his book, On the church, he expressed his willingness to recant such as
could be re- futed from Scripture (precisely the position taken by
Luther at Worms). The Council argued that Scripture must be interpreted
not by the free judg- ment of individuals but by the heads of the
Church, and it demanded that Huss should retract all the quoted articles
without reservation. Both his friends and his accusers pleaded with him
to yield. He refused. He lost the good will of the vacillating Emperor
by declaring that a secular as well as a spiritual authority ceases to
be a lawful ruler the moment he falls into mortal sin. 9 Sigismund now
informed Huss that if the Council condemned him his safe-conduct would
be automatically canceled.</p>
<p>After three days of questioning, and vain efforts by the Emperor and
car- dinals to persuade him to recant, Huss was returned to his prison
cell. The Council allowed him and itself four weeks to weigh the matter.
It was even more complex to the Council than to Huss. How could a
heretic be allowed to live without thereby branding as inhuman crimes
all past executions for heresy? This Council had deposed popes; was it
to be defied by a simple Bohemian priest? Was not the Church the
spiritual, as the state was the physical, arm of society, responsible
for a moral order that needed some in- disputable authority as its base?
To assail that authority seemed to the Coun- cil as clearly treason as
to take up arms against the king. Opinion would have to develop through
another century before Luther would be able to make a similar defiance
and live.</p>
<p>Further efforts were made to secure some semblance of retraction from
Huss. The Emperor sent special emissaries to plead with him. He gave
always the same reply: he would abandon any of his views that could be
disproved from Scripture. On July 6, 1415, in the cathedral of
Constance, the Council condemned both Wyclif and Huss, ordered Hu ss’s
writings to be burned, and delivered him to the secular arm. He was at
once unfrocked, and was led out of the city to a place where a pyre of
faggots had been prepared. A last appeal was made to him to save himself
with a word of retraction; he again refused. The fire consumed him as he
chanted hymns.</p>
<p>Jerome, in a forgivable moment of terror, recanted before the Council
the teachings of his friend (September 10, 141 5). Remanded to prison,
he gradu- ally regained his courage. He asked for a hearing, and after a
long delay he was led before the assembly (May 23, 1416); but instead of
being allowed to state his case he was required first to answer the
several charges laid against him. He protested with a passionate
eloquence that moved the skeptical but</p>
<p>CHAP.Vin) THE WESTERN SLAVS 167</p>
<p>politic Italian humanist, Poggio Bracciolini, who had come to
Constance as secretary to Pope John XXIII.</p>
<p>What iniquity is this, that I, who have been kept in a foul prison
for</p>
<p>340 days, without means of preparing my defense, while my adver-</p>
<p>saries have always had your ears, am now refused an hour to defend
myself? Your minds are prejudiced against me as a heretic; you judged me
to be wicked before you had any means of knowing what manner of man I
was. And yet you are men, not gods; mortals, not eternal; you are liable
to error. The more you claim to be held as lights of the</p>
<p>world, the more careful you ought to be to prove your justice to
all</p>
<p>men. I, whose cause you judge, am of no consequence, nor do I speak
for myself, for death comes to all; but I would not have so many wise
men do an unjust act, which will do more harm by the precedent it</p>
<p>gives than by the punishment it inflicts. 10</p>
<p>The charges were read to him one by one, and he answered each without
retraction. When at last he was allowed to speak freely he almost won
over the Council by his fervor and sincerity. He reviewed some of the
historic cases in which men had been killed for their beliefs; he
recalled how Stephen the Apostle had been condemned to death by priests,
and held that there could hardly be a greater sin than that priests
should wrongly slay a priest. The Council hoped that he would save
himself by asking forgiveness; in- stead he repudiated his earlier
recantation, reaffirmed his faith in the doc- trines of Wyclif and Huss,
and branded the burning of Huss as a crime certain to be punished by
God. The Council gave him four days to recon- sider. Unrepentant, he was
condemned (May 30), and was led out at once to the same spot where Huss
had died. When the executioner went behind him to light the pyre, Jerome
bade him, “Come in front, and light it before my face; if I had feared
death I should never have com e here.” He sang a hymn till he choked
with the smoke.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE BOHEMIAN REVOLUTION: 1415-36</li>
</ol>
<p>The news of Huss’s death, relayed by couriers to Bohemia, aroused a
na - tional revolt. An assembly of Bohemian and Moravian nobles sent to
the Council of Constance (September 2, 1415) a document signed by 500
lead- ing Czechs; it upheld Huss as a good and upright Catholic,
denounced his execution as an insult to his country, and proclaimed that
the signatories would fight to the last drop of their blood to defend
the doctrines of Christ against man-made decrees. A further declaration
pledged the members to obey thereafter only such papal commands as
agreed with Scripture; the Judges of such agreement were to be the
faculty of the University of Prague.</p>
<p>l68 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. VIH</p>
<p>The university itself hailed Huss as a martyr, and praised the
imprisoned Jerome. The Council summoned the rebellious nobles to appear
before it and answer charges of heresy; none came. It ordered the
university closed; the majority of masters and students went on with
their work.</p>
<p>About 1412 one of Huss’s followers, Jakoubek of Strzibo, had proposed
that the early Christian custom of administering the Eucharist in both
forms — sub utraque specie — wine as well as bread — should be restored
throughout Christendom. When the idea captivated the rank and file of
his supporters, Huss gave it his approval. The Council forbade it, and
defended the abandon- ment of the primitive custom on the ground that it
risked the spilling of Christ’s blood. After Huss’s death the University
of Prague and the nobles, led by Queen Sophia, adopted lay communion in
both kinds as a command of Christ, and the chalice became the symbol of
the “Utraquist” revolt. The followers of Huss formulated in 1420 the
“Four Articles of Prague” as their basic demands: that the Eucharist
should be given in wine as well as bread; that ecclesiastical simony
should be promptly punished; that the Word of God should be preached
without hindrance as the sole standard of religious truth and practice;
and that an end should be put to the ownership of exten- sive material
possessions by priests or monks. A radical minority among the rebels
rejected the veneration of relics, capital punishment, purgatory, and
Masses for the dead. All the elements of the Lutheran Reformation were
present in this Hussite revolt.</p>
<p>King Wenceslaus, who had sympathized with the movement, possibly be-
cause it promised to transfer church property to the state, now began to
fear it as threatening civil as well as ecclesiastical authority. In the
“New Town”</p>
<p>The Bohemian nobles offered to accept Sigismund as their king if he
would recognize the Four Articles of Prague. He countered by demanding
from all Czechs full obedience to the Church, and burned at the stake a
Bohemian who refused to renounce the “lay chalice.” The new pope, Martin
V, announced a crusade against the Bohemian heretics, and Sigismund ad-
vanced with a large force against Prague ( 1420). Almost overnight the
Hus- sites organized an army; nearly every town in Bohemia and Moravia
sent impassioned recruits; Jan Zizka, a sixty-year-old knight with one
eye, trained them, and led them to incredib le victories. Twice they
defeated Sigismund’s troops. Sigismund raised another army, but when a
false report came that</p>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Zizka’s men were approaching, this new host fled in disorder without
ever sighting an enemy. Inflated with success, Zizka’s Puritans now
adopted from their opponents the idea that religious dissent should be
suppressed by force; they passed up and down Bohemia, Moravia, and
Silesia like a devastating storm, pillaging monasteries, massacring
monks, and compelling the popu- lation to accept the Four Articles of
Prague. The Germans in Bohemia, who wished to remain Catholic, became
the favorite victims of Hussite arms. Meanwhile, and for seventeen years
(1419-36), Bohemia survived without a king.</p>
<p>Diverse and conflicting elements had united to make the Bohemian
revolu- tion. The native Bohemians resented the wealth and arrogance of
the Ger- man settlers, and hoped to drive them from the country. The
nobles coveted ecclesiastical properties, and thought them worth an
excommunication. The proletariat aspired to free itself from
middle-class masters. The middle classes hoped to raise their modest
power, as against the nobility, in the Diet that ruled Prague and gave
some government to Bohemia. The serfs, especially on church estates,
dreamed of dividing those blessed acres, and, at worst, of freeing
themselves from villein bonds. Some of the lower clergy, fleeced by the
hierarchy, gave the rebellion their tacit support, and provided for it
the religious services interdicted by the Church.</p>
<p>When the arms of the Hussites had won them most of Bohemia, the con-
tradictions in their aims broke them into fratricidal factions. After
the nobles had seized most of the property owned by orthodox
ecclesiastical groups, 11 they felt that the revolution should subside
and invite the sanctifying effects of time. While the serfs who had
tilled these lands for the Church clamored for their division among
themselves as freemen, the noble appropriators de- manded that the
peasants should serve the new masters on the same servile basis as
before. Zizka supported the peasants, and for a time besieged the now
conservative “Calixtine” or chalice Hussites in Prague. Tiring of the
struggle, he accepted a truce, withdrew to eastern Bohemia, and founded
a “Horeb Brotherhood” dedicated to the Four Articles and to killing
Germans. When he died ( 1424) he bequeathed his skin to be made into a
martial drum. 12</p>
<p>In the town of Tabor another party of Hussites formed, who held that
real Christianity required a communistic organization of life. Long
before Huss there had been in Bohemia little groups of Waldensians,
Beghards, and other irrepressible heretics mingling religious with
communistic ideals. They had maintained a salutary quiet until Zizka’s
troops had overthrown the power of the Church in most of Bohemia; now
they came into the open, and captured doctrinal leadership at Tabor.
Many of them rejected the Real Presence, purgatory, prayers for the
dead, and all sacraments except baptism and communion, and discouraged
the veneration of relics, images, and saints, they proposed to restore
the simple ritual of the Apostolic Church, and re-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>pudiated all ecclesiastical rites and robes that they could not find
in early Christianity. They objected to altars, organs, and the splendor
of church decoration, and they destroyed such ornaments wherever they
could. Like later Protestants, they reduced divine worship to communion,
prayer, Scrip- tural readings, a sermon, and the singing of hymns; and
these services were conducted by clergymen indistinguishable from the
laity in dress. Most of the Taborites deduced communism from
millennarianism: Christ would soon come to establish His Kingdom on
earth; in that Kingdom there would be no property, no Church or state,
no class distinctions, no human laws, no taxes, no marriage; surely it
would please Christ, when he came, to find such a heavenly utopia
already established by His worshipers. At Tabor and some other towns
these principles were put into practice; there, said a con- temporary
professo r in the University of Prague, “all is held in common, no one
owns anything for himself alone; so to own is considered a deadly sin.
They hold that all should be equal brothers and sisters.” 13</p>
<p>A Bohemian peasant turned philosopher, Peter Chelcicky, went further,
and wrote in vigorous Czech a series of Tolstoian tracts advocating a
paci- fistic anarchism. He attacked the powerful and the rich, denounced
war and capital punishment as murder, and demanded a society without
lords or serfs, or laws of any kind. He bade his followers take
Christianity literally as they found it in the New Testament: to baptize
only adults, to turn their backs upon the world and its ways, upon oaths
and learning and class distinctions, upon commerce and city life; and to
live in voluntary poverty, preferably tilling the land, and completely
ignoring “civilization” and the state. 14 The</p>
<p>Christendom heard with horror of this supposedly communistic
Christian- ity. The baronial and burgher Hussites in Bohemia began to
yearn for the Church of Rome as the only organization strong enough to
stop the imminent dissolution of the existing social order. They
rejoiced when the Council of Basel invited reconciliation. A delegation
from the Council, without papal authorization, came to Bohemia, and
signed a series of “Compacts” so worded that complaisant Hussites and
Catholics could interpret them as accepting and rejecting the Four
Articles of Prague (1433). As the Taborites refused to recognize these
Compacts, the conservative Hussites joined with the sur- viving orthodox
groups in Bohemia, attacked and defeated the divided Ta- borites, and
put an end to the communistic experiment (1434). The Bohe- mian Diet
made its peace with Sigismund, and accepted him as king ( 1436).</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII ) THE WESTERN SLAVS 171</p>
<p>But Sigismund, accustomed to crowning his victories with futility,
died in the following year. During the chaos that ensued, the orthodox
party secured the upper hand in Prague. An able provincial leader,
George of Podandandandandbrad, organized jn army of Hussites, captured
Prague, restored the Utraquist Jan Rokycana to he archiepiscopal see,
and established himself as governor of Bohemia (1451). When Pope
Nicholas V refused to recognize Rokycana the Utraquists medi- tated a
transfer of their allegiance to the Greek Orthodox Church, but the fall
of Constantinople to the Turks ended the negotiations. In 1458, seeing
that PodSbrad’s excellent administration had restored order and
prosperity, the Diet chose him king.</p>
<p>He turned his energies now to reconstituting religious peace. With
the ap- proval of the Diet he sent to Pius II (1462) an embassy
requesting papal rati- fication of the Compacts of Prague. The Pope
refused, and forbade the laity anywhere to receive the Eucharist in both
kinds. On the advice of Gregor Heim- burg, a German jurist, PodSbrad in
1464 invited the monarchs of Europe to form a permanent federation of
European states, with its own legislature, executive, and army, and a
judiciary empowered to settle current and future international disputes.
16 The kings did not reply; the reinvigorated papacy was too strong to
be defied by a League of Nations. Pope Paul II declared PodSbrad a
heretic, freed his subjects from their oaths of obedience, and called
upon Christian powers to depose him (1466). Matthias Corvinus of Hungary
undertook the task, invaded Bohemia, and was crowned king by a group of
Catholic nobles (1469). Pod£brad offered the throne to Ladislas, son of
King Casimir IV of Poland. Then, worn out with war and dropsy, he died,
aged fifty-one (1471). Bohemia, now Czech- oslovakia, honors him as,
next to Charles IV, her greatest king.</p>
<p>The Diet accepted Ladislas II, and Matthias retired to Hungary. The
nobles took advantage of the youthful weakness of the King to
consolidate their eco- nomic and political power, to reduce the
representation of towns and burghers in the Diet, and to debase into
serfdom the peasantry that had just dreamed of utopia. Thousands of
Bohemians, during this period of revolution and reaction, fled to other
lands.* In 1485 the Catholic and Utraquist parties signed the Treaty of
Kutna Hora, pledging themselves to peace for thirty years.</p>
<p>In eastern Bohemia and Moravia the followers of Chelcicky formed
(1457) a new Christian sect, the Jednota Bratrska, or Church of the
Brotherhood, dedi-</p>
<p>The French, confusing the Bohemian exiles with Gypsies who in the
fifteenth century were entering Western Europe, supposedly from Bohemia,
made Bohbne their word for Gypsy. The name Gypsy is a corruption of
Egyptian , and reflects the claim of the tribe to have come from “Little
Egypt.” Burton traces them to India. 17 In Byzantine lands they took the
name Rom — i.e., (eastern) Roman; in the Balkans and Central Europe they
were called by variants of Atzigan ( Czigany , Zigeuner, Zingari ), a
word of uncertain origin. In European records they first appear in the
early fourteenth century as wandering groups of craftsmen, musicians,
dancers, fortunetellers, and — in general belief — thieves. By 1414 they
reached Ger- many, by 1422 Italy, by 1427 France, by 1500 England.
Usually they accepted baptism, but they took religion and the
Commandments lightly, and soon ran afoul of the Inquisition. They were
expelled from Spain (1499), the Holy Roman Empire (1500, 1548), and
France (1561). Aside from the gay varicolored dress and ornaments or
their more prosperous women, their contribution to civilization lay in
dancing and music — whose alternations of sadness and exuberance have
inspired some major composers.</p>

<p>cated to a simple agricultural life on the principles of the New
Testament. In 1467 it renounced the authority of the Catholic Church,
consecrated its own priests, rejected purgatory and the worship of
saints, anticipated Luther’s doc - trine of justification by faith, and
became the first modem church to practice Christianity. By 1500 it
claimed 100,000 members. These “Moravian Brethren”</p>

<p>The maintenance of peace is difficult even in regions deriving unity
and pro- tection from geographical barriers; consider how much more
difficult it is in states exposed on one or more borders to neighbors
always avid, sometimes tempting, sometimes powerful. Poland in the
fourteenth century was half stifled by Teutonic Knights, Lithuanians,
Hungarians, Moravians, Bohemians, and Germans pressing upon her
frontiers. When Ladislas the Short became grand prince of Lesser —
southern — Poland (1306), he faced a multitude of enemies. The Germans
in Greater — western — Poland rejected his authority; the Knights seized
Danzig and Pomerania; the margrave of Brandenburg plotted to destroy
him; and Wenceslaus III of Bohemia claimed the Polish throne. Ladislas
fought his way through this sea of troubles by arms, diplomacy, and
marriage, united Lesser and Greater Poland into a coherent kingdom, and
had himself crowned at Cracow, his new capital (1320). Dying at seventy
-three ( 1 333)1 he bequeathed his uneasy throne to his only son,
Casimir the Great.</p>
<p>Some might begrudge Casimir III this title, since he preferred
negotiation and compromise to war. Resigning Silesia to Bohemia, and
Pomerania to the Knights, he consoled himself by acquiring Galicia,
around Lwow, and Mazovia, around Warsaw. He devoted his reign of
thirty-seven years to administration, bringing his varied territories
under one law, “that the state might not look like a many - headed
monster.” 18 Under his direction a group of jurists unified the
divergent legislation and customs of the provinces into the “Statutes of
Casimir”— the first codification of Polish laws, and a model of
humanitarian moderation by compari- son with contemporary codes. Casimir
protected Jewish, Greek Orthodox, and other racial or religious
minorities, encouraged education and the arts, established the
University of Cracow (1364), and built so extensively that men said he
had found a Poland of wood and had rebuilt it in stone. He so wisely
promoted all phases of the nation’s economy that farmers hailed him as
“the peasants’ king,” merchants throve in the security of peace, and all
classes called him Great.</p>
<p>Having no male heir, he left his crown to his nephew Louis the Great
of Hun- gary ( 1 370), hoping to win for his country the protection of a
strong monarchy, and a share in the cultural stimulus that the Angevin
dynasty had brought from</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII ) THE WESTERN SLAVS 173</p>
<p>Italy and France. But Louis was absorbed in Hungary, and neglected
Poland. To keep the proud nobles loyal to him in his absence he granted
them, by the ■ “ Privilege of Kassa ” (1374), exemption from most taxes,
and a monopoly of high offices. A war of succession followed his death
(1382). The Seym or Parliament recognized his daughter Jadwiga, eleven
years old, as “king”; but disorder ended only when Jagello, Great Prince
of Lithuania, married Jadwiga (1386), uniting his spacious realm with
Poland, and bringing a masterful personality to the gov- ernment.</p>
<p>The growth of Lithuania was a major phenomenon of the fourteenth
century Gedymin and his son Olgierd brought under their pagan rule
nearly all western Russia: Polotsk, Pinsk, Smolensk, Chernigov,
Volhynia, Kiev, Podolia, and the Ukraine; some of these were glad to
find, under the Great Princes, a refuge from the Tatar Golden Horde that
held eastern Russia in fief. When Jagello succeeded Olgierd ( 1 377) the
Lithuanian Empire, governed from Wilno, reached from the Baltic to the
Black Sea, and almost to Moscow itself. This was the gift that Jagello
brought to Jadwiga, or Poland was the dowry that she brought to him. She
was only sixteen at their marriage; she had been reared as a Roman
Catholic in the finest culture of the Latin Renaissance; he was
thirty-six, illiterate and “heathen”; but he accepted baptism, took the
Christian name of Ladislas II, and promised to convert all
Lithuania.</p>
<p>It was a timely union, for the eastward advance of the Teutonic
Knights was endangering both the wedded states. The “Order of the
Cross,” originally dedi - cated to Christianizing the Slavs, had become
a band of martial conquerors, taking by the sword whatever terrain they
could snatch from pagan or Christian, and establishing a harsh serfdom
over lands once tilled by a free peasantry. In 1410 the Grand Master,
from his capital at Marienburg, ruled Esthonia, Livonia, Courland,
Prussia, and eastern Pomerania, shutting Poland off from the sea. In a
ferocious “Northern War” the Grand Master’s army and that of Jagello—
each, we are told, 100,000 strong — met in battle near Griinewald or
Tannenberg (1410). The Knights were defeated and fled, leaving behind
them 14,000 prisoners and 18,000 slain — among these the Grand Master
himself. From that day the Order of the Cross rapidly declined, until in
the Peace of Thom (1466) it ceded Pomerania and western Prussia to
Poland, with the free port of Danzig as a door to the sea.</p>
<p>During the reign of Casimir IV (1447-92) Poland attained the apex of
her spread, her power, and her art. Though himself quite illiterate,
Casimir ended the knightly scorn of letters by giving his sons a
thorough education. Queen Jadwiga, dying, left her jewels to finance the
reopening of Cracow University — which, in the next century, would teach
Copernicus. Literature, as well as science and philosophy, used the
Latin tongue; in Latin Jan Dlugosz wrote his classic History of Poland
(1478). In 1477 Veit Stoss of Nuremberg was invited to Cracow; he stayed
there seventeen years, and raised the city to a high place in the art of
the time. For the Church of Our Lady he carved 147 choir stalls, and an
enormous altarpiece, forty feet by thirty-three, with a central shrine
of the Assumption as impressive as Titia n’s painting, and with eighteen
panels de -</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>’74</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>picting the life of Mary and her Son — panels almost worthy, though
in wood, to bear comparison with the bronze doors that Ghiberti had made
for the Florentine Baptistery a generation before. For the cathedral of
Cracow, Stoss cut in red mottled marble a superb tomb for Casimir IV.
With these works Gothic sculp- ture in Poland reached its crown and end.
In the reign of Casimir’s son Sigis - ;mund I (1506-48) Polish art
accepte* tne style o the Italian Renaissance. Lutheranism seeped in from
Germany, and a new age began.</p>
