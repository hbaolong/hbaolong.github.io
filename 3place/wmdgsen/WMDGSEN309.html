<p>Pre-Renaissance Italy</p>
<p>1057-1308</p>
<p>I. NORMAN SICILY: IO9O-I 194</p>
<p>I T is remarkable to how many different environments, from Scotland
to Sicily, the Normans adapted themselves; with what violent energy they
aroused sleeping regions and peoples; and how completely, in a few cen-
turies, they were absorbed by their subjects, and disappeared from
history.</p>
<p>For a turbulent century they ruled southern Italy as successors to
the By- zantine power, and Sicily as heirs to the Saracens. In 1060
Roger Guiscard, with a tiny band of buccaneers, began the invasion of
the island; by 1091 its conquest was complete; in 1085 Norman Italy
accepted Roger as its ruler; and when he died ( 1 101 ) the “two
Sicilies”— the island and southern Italy — were already a power in the
politics of Europe. Control of the Straits of Mes- sina, and of the
fifty miles between Sicily and Africa, gave the Normans a decisive
commercial and military advantage. Amalfi, Salerno, and Palermo became
the foci of an active trade with all Mediterranean ports, including
Moslem centers in Tunisia and Spain. Sicily, now a papal fief, replaced
Mo- hammedan mosques with resplendent Christian churches, and in
southern Italy Greek prelates gave way to Roman Catholic priests.</p>
<p>Roger II ( 1 101-54) made Palermo his capital, extended his rule in
Italy to Naples and Capua, and in 1130 expanded his title from Count to
King. He had all the ambition and courage, resourcefulness and subtlety
of his uncle Robert Guiscard; so alert in thought and industrious in
action that Idrisi, his Moslem biographer, said of him that he
accomplished more asleep than other men awake. 1 Opposed by the popes,
who feared his encroachment upon the Papal States; by the German
emperors, who resented his annexation of the Abruzzi; by the Byzantines,
who dreamed of regaining southern Italy; and by the Moslems of Africa,
who longed to recapture Sicily, he fought them all, sometimes several of
them at once, and emerged with his kingdom greater than before, and with
new acquisitions in Tunis, Sfax, Bone, and Tripoli. He made use of the
intelligent Saracens, Greeks and Jews of Sicily to organize a better
civil service and administrative bureaucracy than any other nation in
Europe had at the time. He allowed the feudal organization of
agriculture in Sicily, but kept his barons in check with a royal court
whose law covered every class. He enriched the economy of Sicily by
bringing in silk weavers</p>
<p>7°3</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>704</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>from Greece, and furthered commerce by competent protection of life,
travel, and property. He allowed religious freedom and cultural autonomy
to Moslems, Jews, and Greek Catholics, opened career to all talent,
himself wore Moslem garb, liked Moslem morals, and lived as a Latin king
in an Oriental court. His kingdom was for a generation “the richest and
most civilized state in Europe,” 2 and he was “the most enlightened
ruler of his age.” 3 Without him Frederick I I, a still greater king,
would have been impossible.</p>
<p>The King Roger’s Book of Idrisi suggests the prosperity of Norman</p>
<p>Sicily. A hardy busy peasantry covered the rich soil with crops, and
kept the cities fed. They lived in hovels, and suffered the usual
exploitation of the useful by the clever, but their life was dignified
with a colorful piety, and brightened with festivals and song. Every
season of the agricultural year had its dances and chants; and vintage
time brought bacchanalian feasts that bound ancient Saturnalia with
modern Carnival. Even to the poorest there remained love, and folk songs
ranging from license and satire to lyrics of purest tenderness. In the
town of San Marco, said Idrisi, “the air is perfumed</p>
<p>I11 those homes and palaces the arts of the East served the
conquerors from the West. The looms of Palermo wove gorgeous stuffs in
silk and cloth of gold; the ivory workers made little caskets shaped and
carved in delicate or whimsical designs; the mosaicists covered floors,
walls, and ceilings with Ori- ental themes. Greek and Saracen architects
and artisans raised churches, monasteries, and palaces whose plan and
ornament, showing no trace of Norman styles, gathered up a thousand
years of Byzantine or Arabic influ- ence. In 1143 Greek artists built
for Greek nuns, with funds provided by Roger’s Admiral George, a convent
dedicated to Santa Maria dell’ Ammi - raglio, but now known as the
Martorana from its founder. It has been so</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 705</p>
<p>often restored that little remains of its twelfth-century elements.
Typically an Arabic inscription from a Greek Christian hymn runs round
the inner dome. The floor is of gleaming varicolored marble; eight
columns of dark porphyry frame three apses, their capitals are most
gracefully carved; walls and spandrels and vaults glitter with golden
mosaics, including a famous Christos Pantocrater — the Universal King —
in the sanctuary cupola. Finer still is the Capella Palatina, the chapel
of the palace begun by Roger II in</p>
<ol start="1132" type="1">
<li>Here everything is exquisite: the simple design of the marble pave-
ment, the perfection of the slender columns and their diverse capitals,
the 282 mosaics filling every tempting space, above the altar the solemn
figure of Christ in one of the sovereign mosaics of the world, and, over
all, a massive timber ceiling in honeycomb design, carved, gilded, or
painted with Oriental figures of elephants, antelopes, gazelles, and
“angels” that were probably houris from a Mohammedan’s dream of
paradise. In all medieval or modern art there is no royal chapel that
can compare with this jewel of Norman Sicily.</li>
</ol>
<p>Roger died in 1 1 54, aged fifty-nine. His son William I ( 1 1 54-66)
earned the title of “the Bad,” partly because his life was written by
his enemies, partly because he let others govern while he lived amid
eunuchs and concu- bines in Oriental ease. In his reign the Moslems of
Tunisia rose against the Christians, and ended Norman power in Africa.
William II (1 166-89) lived much the same sort of life as “the Bad,” but
was called “the Good” by amiable biographers if only to avoid a
confusion of names. He asked pardon for his lax morals by financing in 1
176 the monastery and cathedral of Mon- reale — a “mount royal” five
miles outside of Palermo. The exterior is a dis - agreeable confusion of
shafts and interlacing columns; the cloisters are a work of majestic
.strength and beauty; the mosaics of the interior are re- nowned but
crude; the capitals, however, are richly carved with realistic life —
Noah drunk and sleeping, a swineherd tending a pig, an acrobat stand-
ing on his head.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Oriental morals of the Norman Sicilian kings weakened
their constitutions and shortened their line. Forty years after the
death of Roger II his dynasty ingloriously died. William II left no
children, and Tancred, illegitimate son of a son of Roger II, was chosen
king (1189). Meanwhile the German emperor Henry Vi had married
Constance, an aunt of William II; eager to unite all Italy under the
imperial crown, he claimed the throne of the Sicilies; he secured the
active alliance of Pisa and Genoa, whose com- merce was irked by Norman
control of the central Mediterranean; in 1194 he appeared before Palermo
with irresistible force, persuaded it to open its gates to him, and was
there crowned King of Sicily. When he died (1x97) he left his thrones to
his three-year-old son Frederick, who was to become the most powerful
and enlightened monarch of a thirteenth century rich in puissant
kings.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PAPAL STATES</li>
</ol>
<p>North of Norman Italy lay the city-state of Benevento, ruled by dukes
of Lombard origin. Beyond this were the lands under the immediate
temporal power of the popes — the “Patrimony of Peter”— including
Anagni, Tivoli, Rome, and thence to Perugia.</p>
<p>Rome was the center, but hardly the model, of Latin Christianity. No
city in Christendom had less respect for religion, except as a vested
interest. Italy took only a modest part in the Crusades; Venice shared
in the Fourth only to capture Constantinople; the Italian cities thought
of them chiefly as opportunities to establish ports, markets, and trade
in the Near East; Fred- erick II postponed his crusade as long as he
could, and embarked upon it with a minimum of religious belief. There
were religious souls in Rome, gentle spirits who aided pilgrims to
maintain the shrines; but their voices were sel- dom heard above the din
of politics.</p>
<p>Aside from the papacy, Rome was in this period a poor city. The
Norman sack of 1084 had capped six centuries of destruction and neglect.
The popu- lation had shrunk to some 40,000 from its ancient million. It
was not a hub of commerce or industry. While cities of northern Italy
led the economic revolution, the Papal States tarried in a simple
agrarian regime. Market gar- dens, vineyards, and cattle paddocks
mingled with homes and ruins within the walls of Aurelia. The lower
classes of the capital lived half by handicraft, half by ecclesiastical
charity; the middle classes were a medley of merchants, lawyers,
teachers, bankers, students, and resident or visiting priests; the upper
classes were the higher clergy and the landed nobility. The old Roman
custom of owning in the country and living in the city still prevailed.
Long since shorn of any general patriotism that would have united them
for na- tional defense, the Roman nobles divided into factions led by
rich and powerful families — Frangipani, Orsini, Colonna, Pierleoni,
Caetani, Savelli, Corsi, Conti, Annibaldi. . . . Each family made its
Roman residence a castle- fortress, armed its members and retainers, and
frequently indulged in street brawls, occasionally in civil wars. The
popes, having only spiritual weapons little feared in Rome, struggled in
vain to keep order in the city; they were repeatedly subjected to insult
there, sometimes to violence; and many of them, for peace or safety,
fled to Anagni, Viterbo, or Perugia, even to Lyons, at last to
Avignon.</p>
<p>The popes had dreamed of a theocracy in which the Word of God, in-
terpreted by the Church, would suffice as law; they found themselves
crushed amid the autocracy of the emperors, the oligarchy of the nobles,
and the democracy of the citizens. The relics of the Forum and the
Capitol kept alive, among the Romans, the memory of their ancient
republic; and periodically an effort was made to restore the old
autonomy and forms. The</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 707</p>
<p>leading nobles were still called senators, though the Senate had
disappeared; consuls were chosen or appointed, though they wielded no
power; and some old manuscripts preserved the half-forgotten edicts of
Roman law. Inspired by the rise of free cities in northern Italy, the
people of Rome, in the twelfth century, began to demand a return to
secular self-government. In 1143 they elected a Senate of fifty-six
members, and for some years thereafter elected new senators
annually.</p>
<p>The mood of the time called for a voice, and found it in Arnold of
Brescia. Tradition reports that he had studied under Abelard in France.
He returned to Brescia as a monk, practicing such austerities that
Bernard described him as a man who “neither eats nor drinks.” He was
substantially orthodox in doctrine, but denied the validity of
sacraments administered by priests in a state of sin. He held it immoral
for a priest to own property, demanded a return of the clergy to
apostolic poverty, and advised the Church to sur- render all her
material possessions and political power to the state. At the Council of
the Lateran in 1 1 39 Innocent II condemned him and commanded him to
silence; but Pope Eugenius III absolved him on condition of a pil-
grimage to various churches in Rome. It was a kindly error; the sight of
the old republican landmarks fired the imagination of Arnold; standing
amid the ruins, he called upon the Romans to reject clerical rule, and
to restore the Roman Republic (1145). Fascinated by his fervor, the
people chose consuls and tribunes to be actual governors, and
established an equestrian order to serve as leaders in a new militia of
defense. Intoxicated with the ease of this glorious revolution, the
followers of Arnold renounced not only the tem- poral power of the
popes, but the authority, in Italy, of the German em- perors of the Holy
Roman Empire; indeed, they argued, it was the Roman Republi c that
should rule not Italy alone, but, as of old, the “world.” 5 They rebuilt
and fortified the Capitol, seized St. Peter’s, turned it into a castle,
took possession of the Vatican, and levied taxes upon pilgrims. Eugenius
III fled to Viterbo and Pisa (1146), while St. Bernard, from Clairvaux,
hurled denunciations against the people of Rome, and reminded them that
their sub- sistence depended on the presence of the papacy. For ten
years the Comune di Roma ruled the city of the Caesars and the
popes.</p>
<p>Plucking up his courage, Eugenius III returned to Rome in 1148. He
con- fined himself for a time to spiritual functions, distributed
charity, and won the affection of the populace. His second successor,
Hadrian IV, shocked by the killing of a cardinal in a public tumult,
laid an interdict upon the capital ( 1 1 5 5 ) . F earful of a
profounder revolution than the aristocracy could digest, the Senate
abrogated the Republic and surrendered to the Pope. Arnold, ex-
communicated, hid himself in the Campagna. When Frederick Barbarossa
approached Rome Hadrian asked him to arrest the rebel. Arnold was found
and apprehended; he was turned over by the Emperor to the papal prefect
of Rome, and was by him hanged (1155). The corpse was burned, and

<p>ashes were thrown into the Tiber “for fear,” said a contemporary,
“that the people would gather them up and honor them as the ashes of a
martyr.” 6 His ideas outlived him, and reappeared in the Paterine and
Waldensian heretics of Lombardy, in the Albigensians of France, in
Marsilius of Padua, and in the leaders of the Reformation. The Senate
continued to exist till 1216, when Innocent III succeeded in replacing
it with one or two senators congenial to the papal cause. The temporal
power of the popes survived till</p>

<li>VENICE TRIUMPHANT: IO96-I3H</li>
</ol>
<p>North of Ferrara and the Po lay the district of Veneto, proud of the
cities of Venice, Treviso, Padua, Vicenza, and Verona.</p>
<p>It was in this period that Venice matured her power. Her alliance
with Byzantium gave her entry to Aegean and Black Sea ports. At
Constanti- nople, in the twelfth century, her nationals are said to have
numbered over 100,000, and to have held a section of the city in terror
by their insolence and their brawls. Suddenly the Greek Emperor Manuel,
prodded by the jealous Genoese, turned against the Venetians in his
capital, arrested a great number of them, and ordered a wholesale
confiscation of their goods ( 1 1 7 1 ) . Venice declared war; her
people labored night and day to build a fleet; and in 1 17 1 the Doge
Vitale Michieli II led 130 ships against Euboea as a first goal of
strategy against the Straits. But on Euboea’s shores his troops fell
sick</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 709</p>
<p>with a disease said to have been caused by Greeks poisoning the water
sup- ply; so many thousands died that the ships could not be manned for
war; the Doge led his armada back to Venice, where the plague infected
and deci- mated the inhabitants; and at a meeting of the assembly the
Doge, blamed for these misfortunes, was stabbed to death (1172). 7 It is
against the back- ground of these events that we must view the Fourth
Crusade, and the oli- garchic revolution that transformed the
constitution of Venice.</p>
<p>The great merchants, fearing the collapse of their commercial empire
if such defeats continued, resolved to take the election of the doge,
and the determination of public policy, from the general assembly, and
establish a more select council, which should be better fitted to
consider and transact affairs of state, and might serve as a check upon
both the passions of the peo- ple and the autocracy of the doge. The
three highest judges of the Republic were persuaded to appoint a
commission to draw up a new constitution. Its report recommended that
each of the six wards of the city-state should choose two leading men,
each of whom should choose forty able men; the 480 deputies so chosen
were to form the Maggior Consiglio , or Greater Council, as the general
legislature of the nation. The Greater Council in turn was to choose
sixty of its members as a Senate to govern commerce, finance, and
foreign relations. The arrengo or popular assembly was to meet only to
ratify or reject proposals of war or peace. A Privy Council of six men,
elected severally from the six wards, was to govern the state in any
interregnum, and its sanction was to be required to legalize any
governmental action of a doge. The first Greater Council elected by this
procedure chose thirty-four of its members, who chose eleven of their
number, who then, in public de- liberation in the cathedral of San
Marco, chose the doge (1173). A cry of protest arose from-the people at
losing their right of naming the head of the state; but the new doge
diverted the disturbance by scattering coin among the crowd. 8 In 1 192,
on the election of Enrico Dandolo, the Greater Council required the Doge
to swear, in his coronation oath, to obey all the laws of the state. The
mercantile oligarchy was now supreme.</p>
<p>Dandolo, already eighty-four, proved to be one of the strongest
leaders in Venetian history. Through his Machiavellian diplomacy and
personal heroism Venice avenged the disaster of 1171 by capturing and
despoiling Constantinople in 1204; thereby Venice became the dominant
power in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and the commercial
leadership of Europe passed from Byzantium to Italy. In 1261 the Genoese
aided the Greeks to regain Constantinople, and were rewarded with
commercial pref- erence there; but three years later the Venetian fleet
defeated the Genoese near Sicily, and the Greek emperor was forced to
restore the favored po- sition of Venice in his capital.</p>
<p>The triumphant oligarchy capped these external victories with another
constitutional stroke. In 1297 the Doge Pietro Gradenigo pushed
through</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>710</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>the Council a proposal that only those citizens — and their male
posterity- should be eligible to the Council who had sat in it since
1293. 8 The great majority of the people were excluded from office by
this “Closing of the Council.” A closed caste was created; a Libro d’oro
, or Golden Book, of marriages and births within this patrician caste
was kept to ensure purity of blood and monopoly of power; the mercantile
oligarchy decreed itself an aristocracy of birth. When the people
planned a revolt against the new con- stitution their leaders were
admitted into the hall of the Council, and were immediately hanged ( 1
300) .</p>
<p>It must be admitted that this frank and ruthless oligarchy governed
well. Public order was better maintained, public policy more shrewdly
guided, laws more stable and effective, than in the other communities of
medieval Italy. Venetian laws for the regulation of physicians and
apothecaries pre- ceded similar statutes of Florence by half a century.
In 1301 laws forbade unhealthy industries in residential quarters, and
excluded from Venice in- dustries that poured injurious fumes into the
air. Navigation laws were rigor- ous and detailed. All imports and
exports were subject to state supervision and control. Diplomatic
reports covered trade more than politics, and eco- nomic statistics were
here for the first time made a part of government. 10</p>
<p>Agriculture was almost unknown in Venice, but handicrafts were highly
developed, for Venice had imported from the old cities of the Eastern
Medi- terranean arts and crafts half submerged by political upheavals in
the West. Venetian products in iron, brass, glass, gold cloth, and silk
were renowned in three continents. The building of boats for pleasure,
commerce, or war was probably the greatest of Venetian industries; it
reached a capitalistic stage of mass labor and corporate finance, and
almost a socialistic stage through control by its chief client, the
state. Picturesque galleys with lofty prows, painted sails, and as many
as 180 oars bound Venice with Constanti- nople, Tyre, Alexandria,
Lisbon, London, and a score of other cities in a golden chain of ports
and trade. Goods from the valley of the Po came to Venice to be
reshipped; the products of the Rhine cities came over the Alps to spread
out from her quays to the Mediterranean world; the Rialto became the
busiest thoroughfare in Europe, crowded with merchants, sailors, and
bankers from a hundred lands. The wealth of the North could not compare
with the opulence of a city where everything was geared to commerce and
finance, and where one ship sent to Alexandria and back brought 1000 per
cent on the investment — if it encountered no enemy, pirate, or
destructive storm. 11 In the thirteenth century Venice was the richest
city in Europe, equaled perhaps only by those Chinese cities that her
Marco Polo incredibly described.</p>
<p>Faith declines as wealth increases. The Venetians made much use of
re- ligion in government, and consoled the voteless with processions and
para- dise; but the ruling classes rarely allowed Christianity, or
excommunication,</p>

<p>to interfere with business or war. Siamo V eneziani, poi Cristiani ,
ran their motto: “We are Venetians; after that we are Christians .” 12
Ecclesiastics were excluded from any share in the government . 13
Venetian merchants sold arms and slaves, and sometimes gave military
intelligence, to Moslems at war with Christians . 14 A certain
liberality went with this broad-minded venality: Moslems might come
safely to Venice; and the Jews — especially in the Giu- decca on the
island of Spinalunga — might worship peacefully in their syna-
gogues.</p>
<p>Dante denounced the “unbridled lasciviousness” of the Venetians, 13 b
ut we must not trust the strictures of one who cursed so ecumenically.
More significant are the severe penalties prescribed in Venetian law for
parents who prostituted their children, or the vainly repeated laws to
check electoral corruption. 16 The impression we get is of a hard and
brilliant aristocracy stoically resigned to the poverty of the masses,
and a populace solacing pov- erty with the uncornered joys of love. As
early as 1094 we hear of the Car- nival; in 1 228 the first mention of
masks; in 1 296 the Senate made the last day before Lent (the French
mardi gras ) a public holiday. On such occasions both sexes flaunted
their most expensive finery. Rich ladies crowned them- selves with
jeweled tiaras or hoods, or turbans woven with cloth of gold; their eyes
gleamed through veils of gold or silver web; their necks held strings of
pearls; their hands were gloved with chamois or silk; their feet were
shod with sandals or shoes of leather, wood, or cork, embroidered in red
and gold; their gowns were of fine linen, silk, or brocade, sprinkled
with gems, and cut low in the neck to the scandal and fascination of
their times. They wore false hair, they painted and powdered, they laced
and fasted to be slim. 17 They moved freely in public at any time,
joined with shy allure in pleasure parties and gondola escapades, and
listened willingly to troubadours importing Provence modes of song for
the eternal themes of love.</p>
<p>The Venetians did not, in this period, go in for culture. They had a
good public library, but seem to have made little use of it. No
contributions to learning, no lasting poetry, appeared amid this
unrivaled wealth. Schools were numerous in the thirteenth century, and
we hear of private and state scholarships for poor students; but as late
as the fourteenth century there were Venetian judges who could not read
. 18 Music was held in high esteem. Art was not yet the superb
coloratura of later days; but wealth was bringing to Venice the art of
many lands, taste was growing, the foundation was being laid, and old
Roman skills survived, above all in glass.</p>
<p>We must not picture the Venice of that age as quite so lovely as
Wagner or Nietzsche found it in the nineteenth century. Houses were of
wood, and streets were simple earth; the Piazza di San Marco, however,
was paved with brick in 1172, and the pigeons were there as early as
1256. Pretty bridges began to curve over the canals, and over the Grand
Canal the traghetti al- ready ferried many passengers. The side canals
were probably less malodor-</p>

<p>ous then than now, for time is needed for any full ripening. But no
faults of street or stream could close the soul to the grandeur of a
city lifting itself up, century by century, out of the marshes and mists
of the lagoons; or the won- der of a people rising out of desolation and
isolation to cover the sea with its ships, and levy tribute of wealth
and beauty upon half the world.</p>
<p>Between Venice and the Alps lay the city and March of Treviso, of
which we shall note only that its people so loved life that it won the
name of Marca amorosa or gioiosa. In 1 2 14, we are told, the city
celebrated the festival of the Castello d’ amove -, a wooden castle was
set up, and hung with carpets, drapes, and garlands; pretty Trevisan
women held it, armed with scented water, fruit, and flowers; youthful
cavaliers from Venice competed with gay blades from Padua in besieging
the ladies, bombarding them with like weapons; the Venetians, they say,
won the day by mingling ducats with their flowers; in any case the
castle and its fair defenders fell. 19</p>

<li>FROM MANTUA TO GENOA</li>
</ol>
<p>West of the Veneto the famous cities of Lombardy ruled the plains be-
tween the Po and the Alps: Mantua, Cremona, Brescia, Bergamo, Como,
Milan, Pavia. South of the Po, in what is now Emilia, were Modena,
Reggio, Parma, Piacenza; lovers of Italy will not resent these sonorous
litanies. Be- tween Lombardy and France the province of Piedmont
enclosed Vercelli and Turin; and south of these Liguria bent around the
gulf and city of Genoa. The wealth of the region was the gift of the Po,
which crossed the peninsula from west to east, carrying the commerce,
filling the canals, water- ing the fields. The growth of industry and
trade gave these cities the wealth and pride that enabled them generally
to ignore their nominal sovereign, the German emperor, and to subdue the
semifeudal lords of their hinterland.</p>
<p>Usually a cathedral stood at the center of these Italian towns, to
brighten life with the drama of devotion and the spur of hope; near it a
baptistery to mark the entry of the child into the privileges and
responsibilities of Chris- tian citizenship, and a campanile to sound
the call to worship, assembly, or arms. In the neighboring piazza or
public square peasants and craftsmen of- fered their products, actors,
acrobats, and minstrels performed, heralds cried their proclamations,
citizens chatted after Sunday Mass, and youths or knights engaged in
sports or tournaments. A town hall, some shops, some houses or tenements
helped to form a guard of brick around the square. From this center ran
the crooked, winding, climbing streets, so narrow that when a cart or
horseman passed, the pedestrians dodged into a doorway or flat- tened
themselves against a wall. As the thirteenth century progressed and
wealth grew, the stucco houses were roofed with red tiles, making a
pic-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 7 1 3</p>
<p>turesque pattern for those who could forget the odors and the mud.
Only a few streets, and the central square, were paved. Around the city
ran a tow- ered and battlemented wall, for war was frequent, and a man
had to know how to fight if he cared to be other than a monk.</p>
<p>The greatest of these cities were Genoa and Milan. Genoa — la
superba, its lovers called it — was perfectly placed for business and
pleasure, rising on a hill before a sea that invited commerce, and
sharing in the warm climate of a Riviera that reached out to Rapallo on
the east and San Remo on the west. Already a busy port in Roman days,
Genoa developed a population of mer- chants, manufacturers, bankers,
shipwrights, sailors, soldiers, and politicians. Genoese engineers
brought in clear water from the Ligurian Alps by an aqueduct worthy of
ancient Rome, and raised a gigantic mole out in the bay to give her
great harbor security in storm and war. Like the Venetians of this
epoch, the Genoese cared little for letters or art; they spent
themselves in conquering competitors and exploring new avenues for gain.
The Bank of Genoa was almost the state; it lent money to the city on
condition of col- lecting the municipal revenue; through this power it
dominated the govern- ment, and every party that came into office had to
pledge loyalty to the Bank. 20 But the Genoese were as brave as they
were acquisitive. They co- operated with Pisa to sweep the Saracens from
the Western Mediterranean ( 1 o 1 5-1 1 1 3 ) , and then fought ’Pisa
intermittently until they shattered their riv al’s power in the naval
battle of Meloria ( 1 284) . For that last conflict Pisa called all men
between the ages of twenty and sixty, Genoa all between eighteen and
seventy; we may judge from this the spirit and passion of the age. “As
there is a natural loathing between men and serpents,” wrote the monk
Salimbene, “so is there between the Pisans and the Genoese, between</p>
<p>Of the Lombard cities Milan was the richest and most powerful. Once a
Roman capital, she was proud of her age and her traditions; the consuls

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>714</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>her republic defied the emperors, her bishops defied the popes, her
people shared or sheltered heresies that challenged Christianity itself.
In the thir- teenth century she had 200,000 inhabitants, 13,000 houses,
1000 taverns. 24 Herself loving liberty, she did not willingly concede
it to others; she pa- trolled the roads with her troops to force
caravans, withersoever bound, to go to Milan first; she ruined Como and
Lodi, and struggled to subjugate Pisa, Cremona, and Pavia; she could not
rest until she controlled all the commerce of the Po. 25 At the Diet of
Constance in 1154 two citizens of Lodi appeared before Frederick
Barbarossa and implored his protection for their town; the Emperor
warned Milan to desist from her attempts upon Lodi; his message was
rejected with scorn and trampled under foot; Frederick, eager to subdue
Lombardy to imperial obedience, seized the opportunity to destroy Milan
(1162). Five years later her survivors and friends had rebuilt the city,
and all Lombardy rejoiced in her resurrection as a symbol of Italy’s
resolve never to be ruled by a German king. Frederick yielded. But
before he died he mar- ried his son Henry VI to Constance, daughter of
Roger II of Sicily. In</p>
<p>Henry’s son the Lombard League would find a more terrible
Frederick.</p>
<p>V. FREDERICK II: 1 1 94- 1 2 50</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Excommunicate Crusader</li>
</ol>
<p>Constance was thirty when she married Henry, forty-two when she gave
birth to her only child. Fearing doubts of her pregnancy and of her
child’s legitimacy, she had a tent erected in the market place of Iesi
(near Ancona) ; and there, in the sight of all, she was delivered of the
boy who was to become the most fascinating figure of the culminating
medieval century. In his veins the blood of the Norman kings of Italy
merged with the blood of the Hoh- enstaufen emperors of Germany.</p>
<p>He was four when, at Palermo, he was crowned King of Sicily (1198).
His father had died a year earlier, his mother died a year afterward.
Her will besought Pope Innocent III to undertake the guardianship,
education, and political protection of her son, and offered him in
return a handsome stipend, and the regency and renewed suzerainty of
Sicily. He accepted gladly, and used his position to end that union of
Sicily with Germany which Fred- erick’s father had just achieved; the
popes reasonably dreaded an empire that should encompass the Papal
States on every side and in effect imprison and dominate the papacy.
Innocent provided for Frederick’s education, but sup - ported Otto IV
for the German throne. Frederick grew up in neglect, some- times in
poverty, so that compassionate citizens of Palermo had on occasion to
bring the royal gamin food. 2 ® He was allowed to run free in the
streets and markets of the polyglot capital, and to pick his associates
wherever he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 7 1 5</p>
<p>pleased. He received no systematic education, but his avid mind
learned from all that he heard or saw; the world would later marvel at
the scope and detail of his knowledge. In those days and ways he
acquired Arabic and Greek, and some of the lore of the Jews. He grew
familiar with different peoples, garbs, customs, and faiths, and never
quite lost his youthful habit of toler- ance. He read many volumes of
history. He became a good rider and fencer, and a lover of horses and
hunting. He was short but strong, with “a fair and gracious
countenance,” 27 and long, red, curly hair; clever, positive, and proud.
At twelve he dismissed Innocent’s deputy regent and took over the
government; at fourteen he came of age; at fifteen he married Constance
of Aragon, and set out to reclaim the imperial crown.</p>
<p>Fortune favored him, for a price. Otto IV had violated his agreement
to respect the sovereignty of the Pope in the Papal States; Innocent
excommu- nicated him, and ordered the barons and bishops of the Empire
to elect as Emperor his young ward Frederick, “as old in wisdom as he is
young in years.” 28 But Innocent, so suddenly turning toward Frederick,
did not veer from his purpose of protecting the papacy. As the price of
his support he required from Frederick (1212) a pledge to continue
tribute and fealty from Sicily to the popes; to guard the inviolability
of the Papal States; to keep the “Two Sicilies”— Norman southern Italy
and the island — perpetually sepa- rated from the Empire; to reside in
Germany as Emperor and leave the Sici- lies to his infant son Henry as
King of Sicily under a regent to be appointed by Innocent; furthermore,
Frederick bound himself to maintain all the powers of the clergy in his
realm, to punish heretics, and to take the cross as a crusader.
Financing his trip and retinue with money provided by the Pope,
Frederick entered a Germany still held by Otto’s armies. But Otto</p>
<p>But delays ensued. Ot to’s brother Henry raised an army to depose
Fred - erick, and the new Pope, Honorius III, agreed that the young
Emperor must defend his throne. Frederick overcame Henry, but meanwhile
he became involved in imperial politics. Apparently he already longed
for his native Italy; the heat and blood of the South were in his
temperament, and Ger- many irked him; of his fifty-six years only eight
were spent there. He granted large feudal powers to the barons, gave
charters of self-government to several cities, and entrusted the
government of Germany to Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne and Herman of
Salza, the able Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. Despite
Frederick’s apparent negligence Germany en - joyed prosperity and peace
during the thirty-five years of his reign. The</p>
<p>71 6 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>barons and bishops were so satisfied with their absentee landlord
that to please him they crowned his seven-year- old son Henry “King of
the</p>
<p>Romans”— i.e., heir to the imperial throne (1220). At the same time
Fred- erick appointed himself regent of Sicily for Henry, who remained
in Ger- many. This rather inverted the plans of Innocent, but Innocent
was dead. Honorius yielded, and even crowned Frederick emperor at Rome,
for he was anxious that Frederick should embark at once to rescue the
Crusaders in Egypt. However, the barons in South Italy and the Saracens
in Sicily staged a revolt; Frederick argued that he must restore order
in his Italian realm before venturing on a long absence. Meanwhile
(1222) his wife died. Hoping to prod him to fulfill his vow, Honorius
persuaded him to marry Isabella, heiress to the lost kingdom of
Jerusalem. Frederick complied (1225), and added the title of King of
Jerusalem to those of King of Sicily and Emperor of the Holy Roman
Empire. Trouble with the Lombard cities again delayed him. In 1227
Honorius died, and the stern Gregory IX as- cended the papal throne.
Frederick now prepared in earnest, built a great fleet, and gathered
40,000 crusaders at Brindisi. There a terrible plague broke out in his
army. Thousands died, more thousands deserted. The Emperor himself, and
his chief lieutenant, Louis of Thuringia, caught the infection.
Nevertheless Frederick gave the order to sail. Louis died, and Frederick
grew worse. His doctors, and the higher clergy who were with him,
advised him to return to Italy. He did, and sought a cure at Pozzuoli.
Pope Gregory, his patience exhausted, refused to hear the explanations
of Frederick’s emis - saries, and announced to the world the
excommunication of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Seven months later, still excommunicate, Frederick set sail for
Palestine (1228). On learning of his arrival in Syria, Gregory absolved
the subjects of Frederick and his son Henry from their oaths of
allegiance, and began ne- gotiations to depose the Emperor. Taking these
actions as a declaration of war, Frederick’s regent in Italy invaded the
Papal States. Gregory retali - ated by sending an army to invade Sicily;
monks spread a rumor that Fred- erick was dead; and soon a large part of
Sicily and southern Italy were in papal hands. Two Franciscan delegates
of the Pope reached Acre soon after Frederick, and forbade any man in
the Christian ranks to obey the excom- municate. The Saracen commander,
al-Kamil, astonished to find a European ruler who understood Arabic and
appreciated Arabic literature, science, and philosophy, made a favorable
peace with Frederick, who now entered Jeru- salem as a bloodless
conqueror. As no clergyman would crown him King of Jerusalem, he crowned
himself in the church of the Holy Sepulcher. The bishop of Caesarea,
calling the shrine and city desecrated by Frederick’s presence, laid an
interdict upon religious services in Jerusalem and Acre. Some Knights
Templar, learning that Frederick planned to visit the reputed site of
Christ’s baptism in the Jordan, sent secret word to al -Kamil, suggest-
ing that here was a chance for the Sultan to capture the Emperor. The
Mos-</p>
<p>PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>7*7</p>
<p>lem commander sent the letter to Frederick. To free Jerusalem from
its interdict, the Emperor left it on the third day, and went to Acre.
There, as he walked to his ship, the Christian populace bombarded him
with filth. 20</p>
<p>Arrived at Brindisi, Frederick organized an impromptu army, and ad-
vanced to recapture the towns that had yielded to the Pope. The papal
army fled, the cities opened their gates; only Sora resisted, and stood
siege; it was captured and reduced to ashes. At the frontier of the
Papal States Frederick stopped, and sent the Pope a plea for peace. The
Pope agreed; the Treaty of San Germano was signed (1230); the
excommunication was withdrawn. For a moment there was peace.</p>
<p>2 . The Wonder of the World</p>
<p>Frederick turned to administration, and from* his court at Foggia, in
Apulia, wrestled with the problems of too wide a realm. He visited
Germany in 1231, and confirmed, in a “Statute in Favor of Princes,” the
powers and privileges that he and his son had extended to the barons; he
was willing to surrender Germany to feudalism if that would leave him at
peace to develop his ideas in Italy. Perhaps he recognized that the
battle of Bouvines had ended German hegemony in Europe, and that the
thirteenth century belonged to France and Italy. He paid for his neglect
of Germany in the rebellion and suicide of his son.</p>
<p>Out of the polyglot passions of Sicily his despotic hand forged an
order and prosperity recalling the brilliance of Roger IPs reign. The
rebellious Saracens of the hills were captured, were transported to
Italy, were trained as mercenaries, and became the most reliable
soldiers in Frederick’s army; we may imagine the wrath of the popes at
the sight of Moslem warriors led by a Christian emperor against papal
troops. Palermo remained in law the capital of the Regno, as the Two
Sicilies were briefly called; but the real capital was Foggia. Frederick
loved Italy more ardently than most Italians; he marveled that Yahveh
had made so much of Palestine when Italy existed; he c alled his
southern kingdom the apple of his eye, “a haven amidst the floods, a
pleasure garden amidst a wilderness of thorns.” 30 In 1223 he began to
build at Foggia the rambling castle-palace of which only a gateway re-
mains today. Soon a city of palaces rose about his own to house his
aides. He invited the nobles of his Italian realm to serve as pages at
his court; there they rose through widening functions to administer the
government. Head of them all was Piero dclle Vigne, a graduate of the
school of law at Bologna; Frederick made him logothete or secretary of
state, and loved him as a brother or a son. At Foggia, as at Paris
seventy years later, lawyers replaced the clergy in administration;
here, in the state nearest to the See of Peter, the secularization of
government was complete.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>?l8</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>Reared in an age of chaos, and learned in Oriental ideas, Frederick
never dreamed that the order called a state could be maintained except
by mo- narchical force. He seems honestly to have believed that without
a strong central power men would destroy, or repeatedly impoverish,
themselves through crime, ignorance, and war. Like Barbarossa he valued
social order more highly than popular liberty, and felt that the ruler
who competently maintains order earns all the luxuries of his keep. He
allowed some measure of public representation in his government: twice a
year, at five points in the Regno , assemblies met to deal with local
problems, complaints, and crimes; to these assemblies he summoned not
only the nobles and prelates of the dis- trict, but four deputies from
each major city, and two from each town. For the rest Frederick was an
absolute monarch; he accepted as axiomatic the basic principle of Roman
civil law — that the citizens had handed over to the emperor the sole
right to legislate. At Melfi in 1 2 3 1 he issued for the Regno —
chiefly through the legal skill and counsel of Piero delle Vigne — the
Liber Augustalis , the first scientifically codified system of laws
since Justinian, and one of the most complete bodies of jurisprudence in
legal history. It was in some ways a reactionary code: it accepted all
the class distinctions of feudal- ism, and maintained old rights of the
lord over the serf. In many ways it was a progressive code: it deprived
the nobles of legislative, judicial, and minting powers, centering these
in the state; it abolished trial by combat or ordeal; it provided for
state prosecutors to pursue crimes that heretofore had gone unpunished
if no citizen brought in a complaint. It condemned the law’s delays,
advised judges to cut down the perorations of advocates, and re- quired
the state courts to sit daily except on holidays.</p>
<p>Like most medieval rulers, Frederick carefully regulated the national
economy. A “just price” was established for various services and goods.
The state nationalized the production of salt, iron, steel, hemp, tar,
dyed fabrics, and silks; 31 it operated textile factories with Saracen
slave women workers and eunuch foremen; 32 it owned and operated
slaughter houses and public baths; it created model farms, fostered the
cultivation of cotton and sugar cane, cleared woods and fields of
injurious animals, built roads and bridges, and sank wells to augment
the water supply. 33 Foreign trade was largely managed by the state, and
was carried in vessels owned by the government; one of these had a crew
of 300 men. 34 Internal traffic tolls were reduced to a minimum, but
tariffs on exports and imports provided the chief revenues of the state.
There were many other taxes, for this government, like all others, could
always find uses for money. To Frederick’s credit must be put a sound
and conscientious currency.</p>
<p>To make this monolithic state majestic and holy without relying upon
a Christianity normally hostile to him, Frederick strove to restore in
his own person all the awe and splendor that had hedged a Roman emperor.
His exquisite coins were stamped with no Christian word or symbol, but
with the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 719</p>
<p>circular legend IMP /ROM /Cesar /Aug; and on the reverse was the
Roman eagle encircled with the name Fridericus. The people were taught
that the Emperor was in a sense the Son of God; his laws were the divine
justice codi- fied, and were referred to as Iustitia — almost the third
person of a new trinity. Anxious to place himself beside the old Roman
emperors in the history and galleries of art, Frederick commissioned
sculptors to carve his likeness in stone. A bridgehead at the Volturno,
a gate at Capua were adorned with reliefs, in ancient style, of himself
and his aides; nothing remains of these works except a female head of
great beauty. 35 This pre-Renaissance attempt to revive classic art
failed, washed away by the Gothic wave.</p>
<p>Despite his near-divinity and royal industry, Frederick found it
possible to enjoy life at all levels in his Foggia court. An army of
slaves, many of them Saracens, ministered to his wants and managed the
bureaucracy. In 1235, his second wife having died, he married again; but
Isabella of England could not understand his mind or morals, and retired
into the background while Fred- erick consorted with mistresses and
begot an illegitimate son. His enemies charged him with maintaining a
harem, and Gregory IX accused him of sodomy. 30 Frederick explained that
all these white or black ladies or lads were used only for their skill
in song, dance, acrobatics, or other entertainment traditional in royal
courts. In addition to these he kept a menagerie of wild beasts; and
sometimes he traveled with a retinue of leopards, lynxes, lions,
panthers, apes, and bears, led on a chain by Saracen slaves. Frederick
loved hunting and hawking, collected strange birds, and wrote for his
son Manfred an admirable and scientific treatise on falconry.</p>
<p>Next to hunting, he took delight in educated and graceful
conversation — delicato parlare. He preferred the meeting of true minds
to the joust of arms. He himself was the most cultured causeur of his
time, and was noted for his wit and repartee; this Frederick was his own
Voltaire. 37 He spoke nine lan- guages and wrote seven. He corresponded
in Arabic with al-Kamil, whom he called his dearest friend after his own
sons; in Greek with his son-in-law, the Greek Emperor John Vatatzes; and
in Latin with the Western world. His associates — especially Piero delle
Vigne — formed their admirable Latin style on the classics of Rome; they
keenly felt and emulated the classic spirit, and almost anticipated the
humanists of the Renaissance. Frederick himself was a poet, whose
Italian verses won Dante’s praise. The love poetry of Provence and Islam
entered his court, and was taken up by the young nobles who served
there; and the Emperor, like some Baghdad potentate, loved to relax,
after a day of administration or hunting or war, with pretty women
around him, and poets to sing his glory and their charms.</p>
<p>As he grew older Frederick turned more and more to science and
philos- ophy. Here above all he was stirred by the Moslem heritage of
Sicily. He read many Arabic masterpieces himself, brought Moslem and
Jewish scien- tists and philosophers to his court, and paid scholars to
translate into Latin</p>
<p>720 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>the scientific classics of Greece and Islam. He was so fond of
mathematics that he persuaded the Sultan of Egypt to send him a famous
mathematician, al-Hanifi; and he was intimate with Leonardo Fibonacci,
the greatest Chris- tian mathematician of the age. He shared some of the
superstitions of his time, and delved into astrology and alchemy. He
lured to his court the poly- math Michael Scot, and studied occult
science with him, and chemistry, met- allurgy, and philosophy. His
curiosity was universal. He sent questions in science and philosophy to
scholars at his court, and as far abroad as Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and
Iraq. He kept a zoological garden for study rather than for amusement,
and organized experiments in the breeding of poultry, pi- geons, horses,
camels, and dogs; his laws establishing closed seasons for hunt- ing
were based on careful records of pairing and breeding seasons — for
which the animals of Apulia were said to have written him a vote of
thanks. His legislation included an enlightened regulation of medical
practice, opera- tions, and the sale of drugs. He favored the dissection
of cadavers; Moslem physicians marveled at his knowledge of anatomy. The
extent of his learn- ing in philosophy appears in his request to some
Moslem savants to resolve certain discrepancies between the views of
Aristotle and Alexander of Aph- rodisias on the eternity of the world.
“O fortunate emperor!” exclaimed Michael Scot, “I verily believe that if
ever a man could escape death by his learning it would be y ou.” 38</p>
<p>Lest the learning of the scholars whom he had assembled should die
with their deaths, Frederick founded in 1224 the University of Naples —
a rare example of a medieval university established without
ecclesiastical sanction. He called to its faculty scholars in all arts
and sciences, and paid them high salaries; and he assigned subsidies to
enable poor but qualified students to attend. He forbade the youths of
his Regno to go outside of it for their higher education. Naples, he
hoped, would soon rival Bologna as a school of law, and would train men
for public administration.</p>
<p>Was Frederick an atheist? He had been pious in his youth, and perhaps
retained the basic tenets of Christianity till his crusade. Intimate
intercourse with Moslem leaders and thinkers seems to have ended his
Christian faith. He was attracted by Moslem learning, and considered it
far superior to the Christian thought and knowledge of his day. At the
Diet of German princes in Friuli (1232) he cordially received a Moslem
deputation, and later, in the sight of bishops and princes, joined these
Saracens in a banquet celebrating a Mohammedan religious feast. 39 “It
was said by his rivals,” reports Matthew</p>
<p>PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI)</p>
<p>?2I</p>
<p>turn public opinion against him in the final crisis of his life. He
was unques- tionably something of a freethinker. He had his doubts about
the creation of the world in time, personal immortality, the virgin
birth, and other doc- trines of the Christian faith. 42 In rejecting
trial by ordeal he asked: “How</p>
<p>Within limits he gave freedom of worship to the diverse faiths in his
king- dom. Greek Catholics, Mohammedans, and Jews were allowed to
practice their religions unmolested, but (with one exception) they could
not teach in the university, or rise to official position in the state.
All Moslems and Hebrews were required to wear a dress that would
distinguish them from Christians; and the poll tax that Moslem rulers
levied on Christians and Jews in Islam was here levied upon Jews and
Saracens as a substitute for military service. Conversion from
Christianity to Judaism or Islam was severely pun- ished in Frederick’s
laws. But when, in 1 235, the Jews of Fulda were accused of “ritual
murder”— the killing of a Christian child to use its blood at the
Passover festival — Frederick came to their rescue, and denounced the
story as a cruel legend. He had several Jewish scholars at his court.
44</p>
<p>The great anomaly of this rationalist’s reign was the persecution of
her - esy. Frederick did not allow liberty of thought and speech, even
to the professors in his university; it was a privilege confined to
himself and his asso- ciates. Like most rulers, he recognized the
necessity of religion for social order, and could not allow it to be
undermined by his savants; besides, the suppression of heresy
facilitated an intermittent peace with the popes. While some other
monarchs of the thirteenth century hesitated to co-operate with the
Inquisition, Frederick gave it his full support. The popes and their
great- est enemy agreed in this alone.</p>
<p>3 . Empire vs. Papacy</p>
<p>As Frederick’s rule at Foggia developed, his far -reaching aims
became ever clearer: to establish his rule throughout Italy, to unify
Italy and Germany in a restored Roman Empire, and perhaps to make Rome
again the political as well as the religious capital of the Western
world. When in 1226 he in- vited the nobles and cities of Italy to a
diet at Cremona he showed his hand by including in his invitation the
duchy of Spoleto, then a papal state, and by marching his troops through
the lands of the popes. The Pope forbade the nobles of Spoleto to
attend. The Lombard cities, suspecting that Frederick planned to subject
them to a real, instead of nominal, submission to the Em- pire, refused
to send delegates; instead they formed the second Lombard</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>League, in which Milan, Turin, Bergamo, Brescia, Mantua, Bologna, Vi-
cenza, Verona, Padua, and Treviso pledged themselves to a defensive and
offensive alliance for twenty-five years. The diet was never held.</p>
<p>In 1234 his son Henry revolted against his father and allied himself
with the Lombard League. Frederick rode up from southern Italy to Worms,
without an army but with plenty of cash; the rebellion collapsed at the
news of his coming or the touch of his gold; Henry was put into prison,
lan- guished there for seven years, and then, while being transferred to
another place of confinement, rode his horse over a cliff to death.
Frederick went on to Mainz, presided over a diet there, and persuaded
many of the assem- bled nobles to join him in a campaign for the
restoration of imperial power in Lombardy. So aided, he defeated the
army of the League at Cortenuova ( 1 2 3 7 ) ; all the cities
surrendered but Milan and Brescia; Gregory IX offered to mediate, but
Frederick’s dream of unity could not be reconciled with the Italian love
of liberty.</p>
<p>At this juncture Gregory, though ninety and ailing, decided to throw
in his lot with the League, and risk the whole temporal power of the
popes on the issue of war. He had no fondness for the Lombard towns; he
too, like Frederick, considered their liberty a license to chaotic
strife; and he knew that they harbored heretics openly hostile to the
wealth and temporal power of the Church; at this very time the heretics
of besieged Milan were defiling altars and turning crucifixes upside
down. 45 But if Frederick over- came these cities the Papal States would
be engulfed within a united Italy and a united Empire dominated by a foe
of Christianity and the Church. In 1238 Gregory persuaded Venice and
Genoa to join him and the League in war against Frederick; in a powerful
encyclical he charged the Emperor with atheism, blasphemy, and
despotism, and a desire to destroy the author- ity of the Church; in
1239 he excommunicated him, ordered every Roman Catholic prelate to
proclaim him an outlaw, and absolved his subjects from their oath of
allegiance. Frederick replied in a circular letter to the kings of
Europe, repudiating the charge of heresy, and accusing the Pope of wish-
ing to destroy the Empire and to reduce all kings to subservience to the
papacy. The final struggle between empire and papacy was on.</p>
<p>The kings of Europe sympathized with Frederick, but paid small heed
to his appeal for help. The nobility in Germany and Italy sided with
him, hoping to restore the cities to feudal obedience. In the cities
themselves the middle and lower classes were generally for the Pope; and
the old German terms Waibling and Welf, in the form of Ghibelline and
Guelf, were re- vived to signify respectively the adherents of the
empire and the defenders of the papacy. Even in Rome this division held,
and Frederick had many supporters there. As he approached Rome with a
small army one city after another opened its gates to him as to a second
Caesar. Gregory anticipated capture, and led a mournful procession of
priests through the capital. The</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVl) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 723</p>
<p>courage and frailty of the old Pope touched the hearts of the Romans,
and many took up arms to protect him. Unwilling to force the issue,
Frederick by-passed Rome, and wintered at Foggia.</p>
<p>He had persuaded the German princes to crown his son Conrad King of
the Romans (1237); he had placed his son-in-law, the able but brutal
Ezze- lino da Romano, over Vicenza, Padua, and Treviso; and had set over
the other surrendered cities his favorite son Enzio, “in face and figure
our very image,” handsome, proud, and gay, brave in battle and
accomplished in poetry. In the spring of 1240 the Emperor captured
Ravenna and Faenza, and in 1241 he destroyed Benevento, the center of
the papal forces. His fleet intercepted a Genoese convoy carrying toward
Rome a group of French, Spanish, and Italian cardinals, bishops, abbots,
and priests; Frederick confined them in Apulia as hostages to bargain
with. He soon released the French; but his long detention of the rest,
and the death of several in his prisons, shocked a Europe accustomed to
consider the clergy inviolable; and many now believed that Frederick was
the Antichrist predicted some years before by the mystic Joachim of
Flora. Frederick offered to release the prelates if Gregory would make
peace, but the old Pope remained firm even to death (1241).</p>
<p>Innocent IV was more conciliatory. At the urging of St. Louis he
agreed on terms of peace ( 1 244) . But the Lombard cities refused to
ratify this agree- ment, and reminded Innocent that Gregory had pledged
the papacy against a separate peace. Innocent left Rome secretly, and
fled to Lyons. Frederick resumed the war, and no force seemed now
capable of preventing his con- quest and absorption of the Papal States,
and the establishment of his power in Rome. Innocent summoned the
prelates of the Church to the Council of Lyons; the Council renewed the
excommunication of the Emperor, and de- posed him as an immoral,
impious, and unfaithful vassal of his acknowledged suzerain the Pope
(1245). At the Pope’s urging a group of German nobles and bishops chose
Henry Raspe as anti-Emperor; and when he died they named William of
Holland to succeed him. Excommunication was pro- nounced against all
supporters of Frederick, and religious services were in- terdicted in
all regions loyal to him; a crusade was proclaimed against him and
Enzio, and those who had taken the cross for the redemption of Pales-
tine were granted all the privileges of crusaders if they joined the war
against the infidel Emperor.</p>
<p>Surrendering to a fury of hatred and revenge, Frederick now burned
all bridges behind him. He issued a “Reform Manifesto,” denouncing the
clergy as “slaves to the world, drunk with self -indulgence; the
increasing stream of their wealth has stifled their piety.” 40 In the
Regno he confiscated the treasures of the Church to finance his war.
When a town in Apulia led a conspiracy to capture him he had the
ringleaders blinded, then mutilated, then killed. Receiving a call for
help from his son Conrad, he set out for</p>
<p>724 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>Germany; at Turin he learned that Parma had overthrown his garrison,
that Enzio was in peril, and that all northern Italy, and even Sicily,
were in revolt. He put down rebellion after rebellion in town after
town; took hostages from each of them, and slew these men when their
towns rebelled. Prisoners found to be messengers of the Pope had their
hands and feet cut off; and Saracen soldiers, immune to Christian tears
and threats, were used as executioners. 47</p>
<p>During the siege of Parma Frederick, impatient of inaction, went off
with Enzio and fifty knights to hunt waterfowl in the neighboring
marshes. While they were away the men and women of Parma came out in a
desperate sortie, overwhelmed the disordered and leaderless forces of
the Emperor, captured the Emperor’s treasury, his “harem,” and his
menagerie. He levied heavy taxes, raised a new army, and resumed the
struggle. Evidence was brought to him that his trusted premier, Piero
delle Vigne, was conspiring to betray him; Frederick had him arrested
and blinded; whereupon Piero beat his head against the wall of his jail
till he died ( 1 249) . In that same year news came that Enzio had been
captured by the Bolognese in battle at La Fossalta. About the same time
Frederick’s doctor tried to poison him. The quick succession of these
blows broke the spirit of the Emperor; he retired to Apulia, and took no
further part in the war. In 1250 his generals won many successes, and
the tide seemed to have turned. St. Louis, captured by Moslems in Egypt,
demanded of Innocent IV an end to the war, so that Frederick might come
to the Crusaders’ aid. But even as hope revived, the body failed.
Dysentery, the humbling nemesis of medieval kings, struck the proud
Emperor down. He asked for absolution, and received it; the free-
thinker donned the garb of a Cistercian monk, and died at Fiorentino on
December 13, 1250. People whispered that his soul had been borne off by
devils through the pit of Mt. Etna into hell.</p>
<p>His influence was not apparent; his empire soon collapsed, and a
greater chaos ruled it than when he came. The unity for which he fought
disap- peared, even in Germany; and the Italian cities followed liberty,
and its cre- ative stimulus, through disorder to the piecemeal tyranny
of dukes and condottieri who, hardly knowing it, inherited the
unmorality of Frederick, his intellectual freedom, and his patronage of
letters and arts. The virtu, or masculine unscrupulous intelligence, of
the Renaissance despots was an echo of Frederick’s character and mind,
without his grace and charm. The re- placement of the Bible with the
classics, of faith with reason, of God with Nature, of Providence with
Necessity, appeared in the thought and court of Frederick, and, after an
orthodox interlude, captured the humanists and philosophers of the
Renaissance; Frederick was the “man of the Renaissance” a century before
its time. Machiavelli’s Prince had Caesar Borgia in mind, but it was
Frederick who had prepared its philosophy. Nietzsche had</p>

<p>725</p>
<p>Bismarck and Napoleon in mind, but he acknowledged the influence of
Frederick — “the first of Europeans according to my taste.” 48
Posterity, shocked by his morals, fascinated by his mind, and vaguely
appreciating the grandeur of his imperial vision, applied to him again
and again the epithets coined by Matthew Paris: stupor mundi et
immutator mirabilis — “the mar - velous transformer and wonder of the
world.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE DISMEMBERMENT OF ITALY</li>
</ol>
<p>Frederick’s will left th e Empire to his son Conrad IV, and appointed
his illegitimate son Manfred regent of Italy. Revolts against Manfred
broke out almost everywhere in Italy. Naples, Spoleto, Ancona, Florence
submitted to papal legates; “let the heavens rejoice and the earth be
glad!” exclaimed Innocent IV. The victorious Pope returned to Italy,
made Naples his</p>
<p>military headquarters, moved to annex the Regno to the Papal States,
and planned a less direct suzerainty over the northern Italian towns.
But these cities, while joining the Pope in his Te Deum, were resolved
to defend their independence against pontiffs as well as emperors.
Meanwhile Ezzelino and Uberto Pallavicino held several of the cities in
fealty to Conrad; neither of these men had any respect for religion;
heresy flourished under their rule; there was danger that all northern
Italy would be lost to the Church. Sud- denly young Conrad, with a fresh
army of Germans, came down over the Alps, reconquered disaffected towns,
and entered the Regno in triumph- only to die of malaria (May, 1254).
Manfred assumed charge of the imperial forces, and routed a papal army
near Foggia (December 2). Innocent was on his deathbed when the news of
this defeat reached him; he died in despair (December 7), murmuring,
“Lor d, because of his iniquity Thou hast cor- rupted man.”</p>
<p>The rest of the tale is a brilliant chaos. Pope Alexander IV (1254-6)
or- ganized a crusade against Ezzelino; the tyrant was wounded and
captured; he refused doctors, priests, and food, and died of
self-starvation, impenitent and unshrived (1259). His brother Alberigo,
likewise guilty of brutalities and crimes, was also captured, and was
made to witness the torture of his family; then his flesh was torn from
his body with pincers, and while he was still alive he was tied to a
horse and dragged to death. 49 Christians and atheists alike now ran to
savagery, except for the gay and charming bastard Manfred. Having
defeated the papal troops again at Montaperto (1260), he remained for
the next six years master of South Italy; he had time to hunt and sing
and write poetry, and “had not his like in the world,” said Dante, “for
playing of stringed instruments.” 30 Pope Urban IV (1261 -4), de-
spairing of finding in Italy a corrective for Manfred, and perceiving
that the papacy must henceforth rely on France for protection, appealed
to Louis I</p>
<p>X72&lt;5 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>to accept the Two Sicilies as a fief. Louis refused, but allowed his
brother, Charles of Anjou, to receive from Urban the “kingdom of Naples
and Sicily” (1264). Charles marched through Italy with 30,000 French
troops, and routed Manfred’s lesser force; Manfred leaped amid the enemy
and died a nobler death than his sire’s. In the following year a lad of
fifteen, Con - radin, son of Conrad, came down from Germany to challenge
Charles; he was defeated at Tagliacozzo, and was publicly beheaded in
the market square of Naples in 1268. With him, and the death of the
long-imprisoned Enzio four years later, the House of Hohenstaufen
reached a pitiful end; the Holy Roman Empire became a ceremonious ghost,
and the leadership of Europe passed to France.</p>
<p>Charles made Naples his capital, established in the Two Sicilies a
French nobility and bureaucracy, French soldiery, monks and priests, and
ruled and taxed with a scornful absolutism that made the region long for
a resurrected Frederick, and inclined Pope Clement IV to mourn the papal
victory. On Easter Monday of 1282, as Charles was preparing to lead his
fleet to con- quer Constantinople, the populace of Palermo, their hatred
unleashed by the insulting familiarity of a French gendarme with a
Sicilian bride, rose in vio- lent revolt and killed every Frenchman in
the city. The accumulated bitter- ness may be judged from the savagery
with which Sicilian men ripped open with their swords the wombs of
Sicilian women made pregnant by French soldiers or officials, and
trampled the alien embryos to death under their feet. 51 Other cities
followed Palermo’s lead, and over 300 0 Frenchmen in Sicily were
slaughtered in a massacre known as the “Sicilian Vespers” because it
began at the hour of evening prayer. French ecclesiastics in the island
were not spared; churches and convents were invaded by the normally
pious Sicilians, and monks and priests were slain without benefit of
clergy. Charles of Anjou swore “a thousand years” of revenge, and
promised to leave Sicily “a blasted, barren, uninhabited rock”; 52 Pope
Martin IV excommuni - cated the rebels, and proclaimed a crusade against
Sicily. Unable to defend themselves, the Sicilians offered their island
to Pedro III of Aragon. Pedro came with an army and a fleet, and
established the House of Aragon as kings of Sicily (1282). Charles made
futile efforts to recapture the island; his fleet was destroyed; he died
of exhaustion and chagrin at Foggia ( 1 285) ; and his successors, after
seventeen years of vain struggle, contented themselves with the kingdom
of Naples.</p>
<p>North of Rome the Italian cities played Empire against papacy and
main- tained a heady liberty. At Milan the Della Torre family ruled to
the general satisfaction for twenty years; a coalition of nobles under
Otto Visconti cap- tured office in 1277, and the Visconti, as capitani
or duci, gave Milan com- petent oligarchic government for 170 years.
Tuscany — including Arezzo, Florence, Siena, Pisa, and Lucca — had been
bequeathed to the papacy by the Countess Matilda (1107), but this
theoretical papal tenure seldom interfered</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVl) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 727</p>
<p>with the right of the cities to rule themselves, or to find their own
despots.</p>
<p>Siena, like so many Tuscan towns, had a proud past, going back to
Etrus- can days. Ruined in the barbarian invasions, it revived in the
eighth century as a midway stop on the road of pilgrimage and commerce
between Flor- ence and Rome. We hear of merchant guilds there in 1192,
then of craft guilds, then of bankers. The House of Buonsignori, founded
in 1 209, became one of the leading mercantile and financial
institutions in Europe; its agents were everywhere; its loans to
merchants, cities, kings, and popes totaled an enormous sum. Florence
and Siena contested the control of the Via Fran- cesa that connected
them; the two commercial cities fought exhausting wars with each other
intermittently from 1 207 to 1270; and as Florence supported the popes
in the struggles between Empire and papacy, Siena supported the
emperors. The victory of Manfred at Montaperto (1260) was chiefly a
victory of Siena over Florence. The Sienese, though fighting against the
pope, ascribed their success in that battle to their patron saint, the
Virgin Mother of God. They gave Siena to Mary as a fief, placed the
proud legend Civitas Virginis on their coins, and laid the keys of the
city at the feet of the Virgin in the great cathedral which they had
dedicated to her name. Every year they celebrated the feast of her
Assumption into heaven with a solemn and stirring ceremony. On the eve
of the festival all the citizens, from the age of eighteen to seventy,
each holding a lighted candle, formed in procession, according to their
parishes, behind their priests and their magistrates, marched to the
duomo, and renewed their vows of fealty to the Virgin. On the feast day
itself another procession came — of representatives from conquered or
dependent cities, villages, and monasteries; these dele- gates too
marched to the cathedral, brought gifts, and repeated their oath of
allegiance, to the commune of Siena and its Queen. In the city square,
II Campo, a great fair was held on this day; goods from a hundred cities
could be bought there; acrobats, singers, and musicians performed; and
the booth provided for gambling was second in attendance only to Mary’s
shrine.</p>
<p>The century from’ 1 260 to 1360 saw the apogee of Siena. In those
hundred years it built the cathedral ( 1 245-1 3 39), the massive
Palazzo pubblico (13 10-</p>
<p>20), and the lovely campanile (1325-44). Niccolo Pisano carved a
lordly fountain for the duomo in 1266; and by 131 1 Duccio di
Buoninsegna was adorning Sienese churches with some of the earliest
masterpieces of Renais- sance painting. But the proud city undertook
more than it could finance. The victory of Montaperto was fatal to
Siena; the defeated Pope laid an inter- dict upon the town, forbidding
the entry of goods or the payment of debts; and many Sienese banks
failed. In 1270 Charles of Anjou incorporated the chastened city into
the Guelf (or Papal) League. Thereafter Siena was dom- inated and
outshone by her ruthless rival in the north.</p>

<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE RISE OF FLORENCE: 1095-1308</li>
</ol>
<p>Florentia, named for its flowers, had begun some two centuries before
Christ as a trading post on the Arno where it received the Mugnone.
Ruined by the barbarian invasions, it recovered in the eighth century as
a crossroads on the Via Francesa between France and Rome. Ready access
to the Medi- terranean encouraged maritime trade. Florence acquired a
large mercantile fleet, which brought in dyes and silk from Asia, wool
from England and Spain, and exported finished textiles to half the
world. A zealously guarded trade secret enabled Florentine dyers to
color silks and woolens in shades of beauty unsurpassed even in the
long-skilled East. The great wool guilds — the Arte della Lana and the
Arte de’ Calimala *— imported their own materi- als, and made lush
profits in transforming them into finished goods. Most of the work was
done in small factories, some of it in city or rural homes. The
merchants provided the materials, collected the marketable product, and
paid by the piece. The competition of home workers — chiefly women —
kept factory wages low; the weavers were not allowed to take united
action to raise their wages or better their working conditions; and they
were for- bidden to emigrate. To further promote discipline, the
employers persuaded the bishops to issue pastoral letters, to be read
from all pulpits four times a year, threatening with ecclesiastical
censure, even excommunication, the worker who repeatedly wasted wool.
83</p>
<p>This industry and trade needed ready supplies of investment capital;
and soon the bankers contested with the merchants the control of
Florentine life. They acquired large estates through foreclosures; they
became indis- pensable to the pope through financial control of
ecclesiastical properties mortgaged to them; and in the thirteenth
century they had almost a mo- nopoly of papal finance in Italy. 54 The
general alliance of Florence with the popes in their struggle against
the emperors was motivated partly by this financial nexus, partly by
fear of imperial and aristocratic encroachments upon municipal and
mercantile liberties. The bankers were therefore the chief supporters of
the papal party in Florence. It was they who financed the invasion of
Italy by Charles of Anjou through a loan of 148,000 livres (9,600,000)
to Pope Urban IV. When Charles seized Naples the Flor- entine bankers,
to secure repayment, were allowed to mint the coin and collect the taxes
of the new kingdom, to monopolize the trade in armor, silk, wax, oil,
and grain, and the supply of arms and provisions to the troops. 55 These
Florentine bankers, if we may believe Dante, were not the polished
manipulators of our age, but coarse and greedy buccaneers of lucre, who
made fortunes by foreclosures and charged unconscionable interest on
loans</p>
<p>So called from its display center, a “Wicked Lane” formerly devoted
to courtesans.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 729</p>
<p>— like that Folco Portinari who fathered Dante’s Beatrice. 00 They
spread their operations over a wide region. About 1277 we find two
Florentine banking firms — the Brunelleschi and the Medici — controlling
finance in Nimes. The Florentine House of Franzesi financed the wars and
intrigues of Philip IV ; and from his reign Italian bankers dominated
French finance till the</p>
<p>seventeenth century. Edward I of England borrowed 200,000 gold
florins (,160,000) from the Frescobaldi of Florence in 1295. Such loans
were risky, and subjected the economic life of Florence to distant and
apparently irrelevant events. A multiplication of political investments
and governmen- tal defaults, capped by the fall of Boniface VIII and the
removal of the pa- pacy to Avignon (1307), brought a series of bank
failures to Italy, a general depression, and intensified class war.</p>
<p>Three classes divided the secular life of Florence: the popolo minuto
or “little people”— shopkeepers and artisans; the popolo grasso or “fat
people”— employers or businessmen; and the grandi or nobles. The
artisans, grouped in arti minori or lesser guilds, were largely
manipulated in politics by the mas- ters, merchants, and financiers who
filled the arti maggiori or major guilds. In the competition to c ontrol
the government the “little” and the “fat” people united for a time as
popolani against the nobles, who claimed ancient feudal dues from the
city, and supported first the emperors and then the popes against
municipal liberties. The popolani organized a militia in which every
able-bodied resident of the city had to serve and to learn the arts of
war; so prepared, they captured and demolished the castles of the nobles
in the countryside, and forced the nobles to come and dwell within the
city walls under municipal law. The nobles, still rich with rural rents,
built palace-castles in the town, divided into factions, fought one
another in the streets, and competed to see which faction should
overthrow the limited democracy of Florence and set up an aristocratic
constitution. In 1 247 the Uberti faction led a Ghibelline revolt to
establish in Florence a government favorable to Frederick; the popolani
resisted bravely, but a detachment of German knights routed them, and
the Florentine democracy fell. The lead- ing Guelfs fled from the city;
their homes were torn down in unforgetting revenge for their destruction
of feudal castles a century before; thereafter each fluctuation of
victory in the war of the classes and factions was cele- brated by the
exile of the defeated leaders and the confiscation or destruc- tion of
their property. 07 For three years the Ghibelline aristocracy, backed by
a garrison of German soldiers, ruled the city; then, as an aftermath of
Frederick’s death, a Guelf revol t of the middle and lower classes
captured the government (1250), and appointed a capitano del popolo to
check the podesta, as the ancient tribunes of the people had checked the
consuls of Rome. The exiled Guelfs were recalled, and the triumphant
bourgeoisie cemented its domestic success with wars against Pisa and
Siena to control the road of Florentine commerce to the sea and to Rome.
The richer merchants</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>730</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>became a new nobility, and sought to confine state offices to their
class.</p>
<p>The defeat of Florence at Montaperto by Siena and Manfred entailed a
second flight of the Guelf leaders; and for six years Florence was ruled
by Manfred’s delegates. The collapse of the imperial cause in 1268
brought the</p>
<p>The vanquished party of the old nobility reorganized itself under the
hand- some and haughty Corso Donati, and, for unknown reasons, received
the name of Neri, the Blacks. The new nobility of bankers and merchants,
led by the Cerchi family, took the name of Bianchi, the Whites. Hopeless
of aid</p>
<p>from the shattered Empire, the old nobility turned to the Pope for
succor from the triumphant bourgeoisie. Through the Spini, his
Florentine agents in Rome, Donati planned with Boniface VIII to capture
control of Florence. The Tuscan factions had infected the Papal States,
and Boniface despaired of restoring order there unless he should secure
a decisive voice in the mu- nicipal governments of Tuscany. 59 A
Florentine attorney learned of these negotiations, and accused three
Spini agents in Rome of treason to Florence. The priori condemned the
three men (April, 1300), whereupon the Pope threatened to excommunicate
the accusers. A group of armed nobles of the Donati faction assaulted
certain officers of the guilds. The Priory, of which Dante was now a
member, exiled several nobles, in defiance of the Pope (June, 1300).
Boniface appealed to Charles of Valois to enter Italy, subdue Florence,
and recapture Sicily from Aragon.</p>
<p>Charles reached Florence in November, 1301, and announced that he had
come only to establish order and peace. But soon thereafter Corso Donati
entered the city with an armed band, sacked the houses of the priors who
had banished him, threw open the prisons, and released not only his
friends but all who cared to escape. Riot ran loose; nobles and
criminals joined in robbing, kidnaping, killing; warehouses were
plundered; heiresses were forced to marry impromptu suitors, and the
fathers were compelled to sign rich settlements. Finally Corso turned
out the priors and the podesta; the Blacks chose a new Priory, which
submitted all its proposed measures to the Black leaders; for seven
years Corso was the dashing dictator of Florence. The deposed priors
were tried, condemned, and banished, including Dante</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVl) PRE-RENAISSANCE ITALY 731</p>
<p>(1302); 359 Whites were sentenced to death, but most of them were al-
lowed to escape into exile. Charles of Valois accepted these events
grace- fully, and 24,000 florins (,800,000) for his trouble, and
departed south. In 1304 the unchecked Blacks set fire to the homes of
their enemies; 1400 houses were destroyed, leaving the center of
Florence in ashes. The Blacks then divided into new factions, and in one
of a hundred acts of violence Corso Donati was stabbed to death
(1308).</p>
<p>We must remind ourselves again that the historian, like the
journalist, is forever tempted to sacrifice the normal to the dramatic,
and never quite conveys an adequate picture of any age. During these
conflicts of popes and emperors, Guelfs and Ghibellines, Blacks and
Whites, Italy was sustained by a hard-working peasantry; perhaps then,
as now, Italian fields were cul- tivated with art as well as industry,
and were divided and arranged to please the eye as well as feed the
flesh. Hills and crags and mountains were carved and terraced to hold
grapevines, fruit and nut orchards, and olive trees; and gardens were
laboriously walled to check erosion and hold the precious rain. In the
cities a hundred industries absorbed the great majority of men, and left
little time for the strife of speeches, votes, knives, and swords.
Merchants and bankers were not all merciless ghouls; they too, if only
by their acquis- itive fever, made the cities hum and grow. Nobles like
Corso Donati, Guido Cavalcanti, Can Grande della Scala could be men of
culture even if, now and then, they used their swords to make a point.
Women moved with vi- brant freedom in this high-spirited society; love
was for them no wordy sham of troubadours, nor the grim fusion of
sweating peasants, nor yet the serv- ice of a knight to a parsimonious
goddess; it was a gallant and ardent amo- rousness leading with reckless
despatch to a full-bodied abandonment and unpremeditated motherhood.
Here and there, in this ferment, teachers ma- neuvered with desperate
patience to insert instruction into reluctant youth; prostitutes eased
the tumescence of imaginative men; poets distilled their foiled desire
into compensatory verse; artists hungered while seeking perfec- tion;
priests played politics and consoled the bereaved and the poor; and phi-
losophers struggled through a labyrinth of myths toward the bright
mirage of truth. There was a stimulus in this society, an excitement and
competi- tion, that sharpened men ’s wits and tongues, brought forth
their reserve and unsuspected powers, and lured them, even if by their
own destruction, to clear the way and set the stage for the Renaissance.
Through many pains, and the shedding of blood, would come the great
Rebirth.</p>
