<h4 id="chapter-viii">CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<p>Mohammed</p>
<p>570-632</p>
<p>I. ARABIA*</p>
<p>I N the year 565 Justinian died, master of a great empire. Five years
later Mohammed was born into a poor family in a country three quarters
des- ert, sparsely peopled by nomad tribes whose total wealth could
hardly have furnished the sanctuary of St. Sophia. No one in those years
would have dreamed that within a century these nomads would conquer half
of Byzan- tine Asia, all Persia and Egypt, most of North Africa, and be
on their way to Spain. The explosion of the Arabian peninsula into the
conquest and conver- sion of half the Mediterranean world is the most
extraordinary phenomenon in medieval history.</p>
<p>Arabia is the largest of all peninsulas: 1400 miles in its greatest
length, 1 250 in its greatest width. Geologically it is a continuation
of the Sahara, part of the sandy belt that runs up through Persia to the
Gobi Desert. Arab means arid. Physically Arabia is a vast plateau,
rising precipitously to 12,000 feet within thirty miles of the Red Sea,
and sloping through mountainous waste- lands eastward to the Persian
Gulf. In the center are some grassy oases and palm-studded villages,
where water can be reached by shallow wells; around this nucleus the
sands stretch in every direction for hundreds of miles. Snow falls there
once in forty years; the nights cool down to 38 degrees Fahrenheit; the
daily sun burns the face and boils the blood; and the sand-laden air
neces- sitates long robes and head-bands to guard flesh and hair. The
skies are almost always clear, the air “like sparkling wine.” 1 Along
the coasts an occasional</p>

<li>The rediscovery of Arabia by modern Europeans illustrates the
internationalism of science in the nineteenth century. It began in
1761-4, when Carstcn Niebuhr traveled through the peninsula under the
auspices of the Danish government; his published account (1772) was the
first comprehensive description of Arabia. In 1807 Domingo Badia y
Leblich, a Spaniard dis- guised as a Moor, visited Mecca, and gave the
first accurate account of the pilgrimage ritual. In 1814-15 Johann
Ludwig Burckhardt (1784-1817), a Swiss disguised as a Moslem, spent
several months in Mecca and Medina; his learned reports were
corroborated by later travelers. In 1853 Richard Burton, an Englishman
dressed as an Afghan pilgrim, visited Medina and Mecca, and described
his perilous journey in two absorbing volumes. In 1869-70 J. Halevy, a
French Jew, explored the sites, and recorded the rock inscriptions, of
the ancient Minaean, Sabaean, and Himyarite kingdoms. In 1875 Charles
Montagu Doughty, an Englishman, traveled from Damascus in the pilgrimage
caravan, and recorded his vicissitudes in Arabia Deserta (1888), one of
the peaks of English prose. In 1882-8 E. Glaser, an Austrian, in three
arduous expeditions, copied 1032 inscriptions, which are now our chief
source for the history of pre- Islamic Arabia.</li>

<p>156 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>torrent of rain brings the possibility of civilization: most of all
on the western littoral, in the Hejaz district with the cities of Mecca
and Medina; and south- west in the district of Yemen, the home of the
ancient kingdoms of Arabia.</p>
<p>A Babylonian inscription of approximately 2400 b . c . records the
defeat of a king of Magan by the Babylonian ruler Naram-Sin. Magan was
the capital of a Minaean kingdom in southwest Arabia; twenty-five of its
later kings are known from Arabian inscriptions that go back to 800 b .
c . An inscription tentatively ascribed to 2300 b . c . mentions another
Arabian kingdom, Saba, in Yemen; from Saba or its North Arabian
colonies, it is now agreed, the Queen of Sheba “went up” to Solomon
about 950 b . c . The Sabaean kings made their capital at Marib, fought
the usual wars of “defense,” built great irrigation works like the Marib
dams (whose ruins are still visible), raised gigantic castles and
temples, subsidized religion handsomely, and used it as an instrument of
rule. 2 Their inscriptions — probably not older than 900 b . c . — are
beautifully carved in an alphabetical script. The Sabaeans produced the
frankincense and myrrh that played so prominent a role in Asiatic and
Egyptian rituals; they controlled the sea trade between India and Egypt,
and the south end of the caravan route that led through Mecca and Medina
to Petra and Jerusalem. About 1 1 5 b . c . another petty kingdom of
souths west Arabia, the Himyarite, conquered Saba, and thereafter
controlled Arabian trade for several centuries. In 25 b . c . Augustus,
irked by Arabian control of Egyptian-Indian commerce, sent an army under
Aelius Gallus to capture Marib; the legions were misled by native
guides, were decimated by heat and disease, and failed in their mission;
but another Roman army captured the Arab port of Adana (Aden), and gave
control of the Egypt-India route to Rome. (Britain repeated this
procedure in our time.)</p>
<p>In the second century before Christ some Himyarites crossed the Red
Sea, colonized Abyssinia, and gave the indigenous Negro population a
Semitic culture and considerable Semitic blood.* The Abyssinians
received Christianity, crafts, and arts from Egypt and Byzantium; their
merchant vessels sailed as far as India and Ceylon; and seven little
kingdoms acknowledged the Negus as their sover- eign.t Meanwhile in
Arabia many Himyarites followed the lead of their king Dhu- Nuwas and
accepted Judaism. With a convert’s zeal, Dhu -Nuwas perse- cuted the
Christians of southwest Arabia; they called to their coreligionists to
rescue them; the Abyssinians came, conquered the Himyarite kings (a.d.
522), and replaced them with an Abyssinian dynasty. Justinian allied
himself with this new state; Persia countered by taking up the cause of
the deposed Himyarites, driving out the Abyssinians, and setting up in
Yemen (5 75) a Persian rule that ended some sixty years later with the
Moslem conquest of Persia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The term Semitic is due to the legendary derivation of the peoples
so called from Shem, son of Noah (Gen. x, 1). No clear definition of
Semite can be given. In general the populations of Syria, Palestine,
Mesopotamia, and Arabia, and the Arab populations of Africa, may be
called Semitic in the sense that they use Semitic languages; the ancient
peoples of Asia Minor, Armenia, and the Caucasus, and the peoples of
Persia, North India, most of Europe, and all of the Europeanized
Americas may be called “Indo - European” as using Indo -Germanic
tongues.</li>

<p>t Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , Everyman Library
edition, IV, 322. It was one of the major achievements of Gibbon that he
recognized the importance of Islam in medieval history, and recorded its
political career with remarkable erudition, accuracy, and eloquence.</p>
<p>MOHAMMED</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII )</p>
<p>1 57</p>
<p>In the north some minor Arab kingdoms flourished briefly. The sheiks
of the Ghassanid tribe ruled northwestern Arabia and Palmyrene Syria
from the third to the seventh century as phylarchs, or client kings, of
Byzantium. During the same period the Lakhmid kings established at Hira,
near Babylon, a semi-Persian court and culture famous for its music and
poetry. Long before Mohammed the Arabs had expanded into Syria and
Iraq.</p>
<p>Aside from these petty kingdoms of south and north, and to a large
extent within them, the political organization of pre-Islamic Arabia was
a primitive kinship structure of families united in clans and tribes.
Tribes were named from a supposed common ancestor; so the banu-Ghassan
thought themselves the “children of Ghassan.” Arabia as a political
unit, befor e Mohammed, existed only in the careless nomenclature of the
Greeks, who called all the population of the peninsula Sarakenoi,
Saracens, apparently from the Arabic shtrrqiyun, “Easterners.”
Difficulties of communication compelled local or tribal self-sufficiency
and particularism. The Arab felt no duty or loyalty to any group larger
than his tribe, but the intensity of his devotion varied inversely as
its extent; for his tribe he would do with a clear conscience what
civilized people do only for thei r country, religion, or “race”— i.e.,
lie, steal, kill, and die. Each tribe or clan was loosely ruled by a
sheik chosen by its leaders from a family traditionally prominent
through wealth or wisdom or war.</p>
<p>In the villages men coaxed some grains and vegetables from the
unwilling soil, raised a few cattle, and bred some fine horses; but they
found it more profitable to cultivate orchards of dates, peaches,
apricots, pomegranates, lemons, oranges, bananas, and figs; some nursed
aromatic plants like frankin- cense, thyme, jasmine, and lavender; some
pressed itr or attar from highland roses; some cupped trees to draw
myrrh or balsam from the trunks. Possibly a twelfth of the population
lived in cities on or near the west coast. Here was a succession of
harbors and markets for Red Sea commerce, while farther inland lay the
great caravan routes to Syria. We hear of Arabian trade with Egypt as
far back as 2743 b.c.; 3 probably as ancient was the trade with India.
Annual fairs called merchants now to one town, now to another; the great
annual fair at Ukaz, near Mecca, brought together hundreds of merchants,
actors, preachers, gamblers, poets, and prostitutes.</p>
<p>Five sixths of the population were nomad Bedouins, herdsmen who moved
with their flocks from one pastureland to another according to season
and the winter rains. The Bedouin loved horses, but in the desert the
camel was his greatest friend. It pitched and rolled with undulant
dignity, and made only eight miles an hour; but it could go without
water five days in summer and twenty-five in winter; its udders gave
milk, its urine provided hair tonic,* its dung could be burned for fuel;
when it died it made tender meat, and its</p>
<ul>
<li>The nomad women, says Doughty, “wash their babies in camel urine,
and think thus to help them from insects; . . . and in this water both
men and women comb their long hair.” 4</li>
</ul>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>I 5 8</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>hair and hide made clothing and tents. With such varied sustenance
the Bedouin could face the desert, as patient and enduring as his camel,
as sensi- tive and spirited as his horse. Short and thin, well-knit and
strong, he could live day after day on a few dates and a little milk;
and from dates he made the wine that raised him out of the dust into
romance. He varied the routine of his life with love and feud, and was
as quick as a Spaniard (who inherited his blood) to avenge insult and
injury, not only for himself but for his clan. A good part of his life
was spent in tribal war; and when he conquered Syria, Persia, Egypt, and
Spain, it was but an exuberant expansion of his plunder- ing razzias or
raids. Certain periods in the year he conceded to the “holy truce,” for
religious pilgrimage or for trade; otherwise, he felt, the desert was
his; whoever crossed it, except in that time, or without paying him
tribute, was an interloper; to rob such trespassers was an unusually
straightforward form of taxation. He despised the city because it meant
law and trade; he loved the merciless desert because it left him free.
Kindly and murderous, generous and avaricious, dishonest and faithful,
cautious and brave, the Bedouin, however poor, fronted the world with
dignity and pride, vain of the purity of his inbred blood, and fond of
adding his lineage to his name.</p>
<p>On one point above all he brooked no argument, and that was the
incom- parable beauty of his women. It was a dark, fierce, consuming
beauty, worth a million odes, but brief with the tragic hasty fading of
hot climes. Before Mohammed — and after him only slightly less so — the
career of the Arab woman passed from a moment’s idolatry to a lifetime
of drudgery. She might be buried at birth if the father so willed ; 5 at
best he mourned her coming and hid his face from his fellows; somehow
his best efforts had failed. Her winsome childhood earned a few years of
love; but at seven or eight she was married off to any youth of the clan
whose father would offer the purchase price for the bride. Her lover and
husband would fight the world to defend her person or honor; some of the
seeds and fustian of chivalry went with these passionate lovers to
Spain. But the goddess was also a chattel; she formed part of the estate
of her father, her husband, or her son, and was bequeathed with it; she
was always the servant, rarely the comrade, of the man. He de- manded
many children of her, or rather many sons; her duty was to produce
warriors. She was, in many cases, but one of his many wives. He could
dis- miss her at any time at will.</p>
<p>Nevertheless her mysterious charms rivaled battle as a theme and
stimulus for his verse. The pre-Moslem Arab was usually illiterate, but
he loved poetry only next to horses, women, and wine. He had no
scientists or historians, but he had a heady passion for eloquence, for
fine and correct speech, and intri- cately patterned verse. His language
was closely kin to the Hebrew; complex in inflexions, rich in
vocabulary, precise in differentiations, expressing now every nuance of
poetry, later every subtlety of philosophy. The Arabs took pride in the
antiquity and fullness of their language, loved to roll its
melliflu-</p>
<p>MOHAMMED</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>l 59</p>
<p>ous syllables in oratorical flourishes on tongue or pen, and listened
with tense ecstasy to the poets who, in villages and cities, in desert
camps or at the fairs, recalled to them, in running meters and endless
rhymes, the loves and wars of their heroes, tribes, or kings. The poet
was to the Arabs their historian, genealogist, satirist, moralist,
newspaper, oracle, call to battle; and when a poet won a prize at one of
the many poetry contests, his whole tribe felt hon- ored, and rejoiced.
Every year, at the Ukaz fair, the greatest of these contests was held;
almost daily for a month the clans competed through their poets; there
were no judges but the eagerly or scornfully listening multitudes; the
winning poems were written down in brilliantly illuminated characters,
were therefore called the Golden Songs, and were preserved like
heirlooms in the treasuries of princes and kings. The Arabs called them
also Muallaqat , or Suspended , because legend said that the prize
poems, inscribed upon Egyp- tian silk in letters of gold, were hung on
the walls of the Kaaba in Mecca.</p>
<p>Seven such Muallaqat , dating from the sixth century, survive from
those pre-Islamic days. Their form is the qasida , a narrative ode, in
elaborately complex meter and rhyme, usually of love or war. In one of
them, by the poet Labid, a soldier returns from his campaigns to the
village and home where he had left his wife; he finds his cottage empty,
his wife gone off with another man; Labid describes the scene with
Goldsmith’s tenderness, and with greater eloquence and force. 6 In
another the Arab women prod their men to battle:</p>
<p>Courage! courage! defenders of women! Smite with the edge of</p>
<p>your swords! . . . We are the daughters of the morning star; soft are
the carpets we tread beneath our feet; our necks are adorned with</p>
<p>pearls; our tresses are perfumed with musk. The brave who confront
the foe we will clasp to our bosoms, but the dastards who flee we will
spurn; not for them our embraces! 7</p>
<p>Unabashedly sensual is an ode by Imru’lqais:</p>
<p>Fair too was that other, she the veil-hidden one, howdahed how close,
how guarded! Yet did she welcome me.</p>
<p>Passed I twixt her tent-ropes — what though her near-of-kin lay in
the dark to slay me, blood-shedders all of them.</p>
<p>Came I at the mid-night, hour when the Pleiades showed as the links
of seed- pearls binding the sky’s girdle.</p>
<p>Stealing in, I stood there. She had cast off from her every robe but
one robe, all but her night-garment.</p>
<p>Tenderly she scolded: What is this stratagem? Speak, on thine oath,
thou mad one. Stark is thy lunacy.</p>
<p>Passed we out together, while she drew after us on our twin track, to
hide it, wise, her embroideries,</p>
<p>Fled beyond the camp-fires. There in security dark in the sand we lay
down far from the prying eyes.</p>
<p>l6o THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>By her plaits I wooed her, drew her face near to me, won to her waist
how frail-lined, hers of the ankle-rings.</p>
<p>Fair-faced she — no redness — noble of countenance, smooth as of
glass her bosom, bare with its necklaces.</p>
<p>Thus are pearls yet virgin, seen through the dark water, clear in
the</p>
<p>sea-depths gleaming, pure, inaccessible.</p>
<p>Coyly she withdraws her, shows us a cheek, a lip, she a gazelle
of</p>
<p>Wujra; ….</p>
<p>Roe- like her throat slender, white as an ariel’s, sleek to thy lips
up -</p>
<p>lifted-pearls are its ornament.</p>
<p>On her shoulders fallen thick lie the locks of her, dark as the
date-</p>
<p>clusters hung from the palm-branches. . . .</p>
<p>Slim her waist — a well-cord scarce has its slenderness. Smooth are
her legs as reed-stems stripped at a water-head.</p>
<p>The morn through she sleepeth, muck-stream in indolence, hardly at
noon hath risen, girded her day dresses.</p>
<p>Soft her touch — her fingers fluted as water- worms, sleek as the
snakes of Thobya, tooth-sticks of Ishali.</p>
<p>Lighteneth she night’s darkness, ay, as an evening lamp hung for a
sign of guidance lone on a hermitage. 8</p>
<p>The pre-Islamic poets sang their compositions to musical
accompaniment; music and poetry were bound into one form. The flute, the
lute, the reed pipe or oboe, and the tambourine were the favored
instruments. Singing girls were often invited to amuse male banqueteers;
taverns were equipped with them; the Ghassanid kings kept a troupe of
them to ease the cares of royalty; and when the Meccans marched against
Mohammed in 624 they took with them a bevy of singing girls to warm
their campfires and prod them on to war. Even in those early “Days of
Ignorance,” as Moslems would call the pre-Moslem period, the Arab song
was a plaintive cantilena that used few words, and carried a note so
tenaciously along the upper reaches of the scale that a few verses might
provide libretto for an hour.</p>
<p>The desert Arab had his own primitive and yet subtle religion. He
feared and worshiped incalculable deities in stars and moon and the
depths of the earth; occasionally he importuned the mercy of a punitive
sky; but for the most part he was so confused by the swarm of spirits
(jinn) about him that he despaired of appeasing them, accepted a
fatalistic resignation, prayed with masculine brevity, and shrugged his
shoulders over the infinite. 9 He seems to have given scant thought to a
life after death; sometimes, however, he had his camel tied foodless to
his grave, so that it might soon follow him to the other world, and save
him from the social disgrace of going on foot in para- dise. 10 Now and
then he offered human sacrifice; and here and there he worshiped sacred
stones.</p>
<p>The center of this stone worship was Mecca. This holy city owed none
of its growth to climate, for the mountains of bare rock that almost
enclosed it</p>
<p>MOHAMMED</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>ensured a summer of intolerable heat; the valley was an arid waste;
and in all the town, as Mohammed knew it, hardly a garden grew. But its
location — halfway down the west coast, forty-eight miles from the Red
Sea — made it a convenient stopping point for the mile-long caravans,
sometimes of a thousand camels, that carried trade between southern
Arabia (and therefore India and Central Africa) and Egypt, Palestine,
and Syria. The merchants who controlled this trade formed joint-stock
companies, dominated the fairs at Ukaz, and managed the lucrative
religious ritual that centered round the Kaaba and its sacred Black
Stone.</p>
<p>Kaaba means a square structure, and is one with our word cube. In the
belief of orthodox Moslems, the Kaaba was built or rebuilt ten times.
The first was erected at the dawn of history by angels from heaven; the
second by Adam; the third by his son Seth; the fourth by Abraham and his
son Ish- mael by Hagar . . . the seventh by Qusay, chief of the Quraish
tribe; the ei ghth by the Quraish leaders in Mohammed’s lifetime (605) ;
the ninth and tenth by Moslem leaders in 681 and 696; the tenth is
substantially the Kaaba of today. It stands near the center of a large
porticoed enclosure, the Masjid al-Haram, or Sacred Mosque. It is a
rectangular stone edifice forty feet long, thirty-five wide, fifty high.
In its southeast corner, five feet from the ground, just right for
kissing, is embedded the Black Stone, of dark red material, oval in
shape, some seven inches in diameter. Many of its worshipers believe
that this stone was-sent down from heaven — and perhaps it was a
meteorite; most of them believe that it has been a part of the Kaaba
since Abraham. Moslem scholars interpret it as symbolizing that part of
Abraham’s pr ogeny (Ishmael and his offspring) which, rejected by
Israel, became, they think, the found- ers of the Quraish tribe; they
apply to it a passage from Psalm cxviii, 22-3: “The stone which the
builders rejected is become the head of the corner; this is Y ahveh’s
doing”; and another from Matthew xxi, 42 -3, in which Jesus, having
quoted these strange words, adds: “Therefore the Kingdom of God shall be
taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the
fruits thereof”— though the virile Moslems would hardly claim to have
fulfilled the ethics of Christ.</p>
<p>Within the Kaaba, in pre-Moslem days, were several idols representing
gods. One was called Allah, and was probably the tribal god of the
Quraish; three others were Allah’s daughters— al-Uzza, al-Lat, and
Manah. We may judge the antiquity of this Arab pantheon from the mention
of Al-il-Lat (al- Lat) by Herodotus as a major Arabian deity. 11 The
Quraish paved the way for monotheism by worshiping Allah as chief god;
He was presented to the Meccans as the Lord of their soil, to Whom they
must pay a tithe of their crops and the first-born of their herds. The
Quraish, as alleged descendants of Abraham and Ishmael, appointed the
priests and guardians of the shrine, and managed its revenues. An
aristocratic minority of the tribe, as descend- ants of Qusay,
controlled the civil government of Mecca.</p>

and died at Medina on the way back. Two months later (569) Amina was
delivered of the most im- portant figure in medieval history.</p>
<p>H. MOHAMMED IN MECCA: 569-622 *</p>
<p>His ancestry was distinguished, his patrimony modest: Abdallah had
left him five camels, a flock of goats, a house, and a slave who nursed
him in his infancy. His name, meaning “highly praised,” lent itself well
to certain Bib- lical passages as predicting his advent. His mother died
when he was six; he was taken over by his grandfather, then seventy-six,
and later by his uncle Abu Talib. They gave him affection and care, but
no one seems to have both- ered to teach him how to read or write; 12
this feeble accomplishment was held in low repute by the Arabs of the
time; only seventeen men of the Quraish tribe condescended to it. 13
Mohammed was never known to write anything himself; he used an
amanuensis. His apparent illiteracy did not pre- vent him from composing
the most famous and eloquent book in the Arabic tongue, and from
acquiring such understanding of the management of men as seldom comes to
highly educated persons.</p>
<p>Of his youth we know almost nothing, though fables about it have
filled ten thousand volumes. At the age of twelve, says a tradition, he
was taken by Abu Talib on a caravan to Bostra in Syria; perhaps on that
journey he picked up some Jewish and Christian lore. Another tradition
pictures him, a few years later, as going to Bostra on mercantile
business for the rich widow Khadija. Then suddenly we find him, aged
twenty-five, marrying her, aged forty and the mother of several
children. Until her death twenty-six years later Mohammed lived with
Khadija in a monogamous condition highly un- usual for a Moslem of
means, but perhaps natural in their recipient. She bore him some
daughters, of whom the most famous was Fatima, and two sons who died in
infancy. He consoled his grief by adopting Ali, the orphan son of Abu
Talib. Khadija was a good woman, a good wife, a good merchant; she
remained loyal to Mohammed through all his spiritual vicissitudes; and
amid all his wives he remembered her as the best.</p>

<p>hunger. Before him all forgot their griefs and pains. 14</p>
<p>He was a man of dignity, and seldom laughed; he kept his keen sense
of humor under control, knowing its hazards for public men. Of a
delicate con- stitution, he was nervous, impressionable, given to
melancholy pensiveness. In moments of excitement or anger his facial
veins would swell alarmingly; but he knew when to abate his passion, and
could readily forgive a disarmed and repentant foe.</p>
<p>There were many Christians in Arabia, some in Mecca; with at least
one of these Mohammed became intimate — Khadija’s cousin Waraqah ibn
Nawfal, “who knew the Scriptures of the Hebrews and the Christians.” 15
Moham - med frequently visited Medina, where his father had died; there
he may have met some of the Jews who formed a large part of the
population. Many a page of the Koran proves that he learned to admire
the morals of the Chris- tians, the monotheism of the Jews, and the
strong support given to Christi- anity and Judaism by the possession of
Scriptures believed to be a revelation from God. Compared with these
faiths the polytheistic idolatry, loose moral- ity, tribal warfare, and
political disunity of Arabia may have seemed to him shamefully
primitive. He felt the need of a new religion — perhaps of one that
would unify all these factious groups into a virile and healthy nation;
a re- ligion that would give them a morality not earth-bound to the
Bedouin law of violence and revenge, but based upon commandments of
divine origin and therefore of indisputable force. Others may have had
similar thoughts; we hear of several “prophets” arising in Arabia about
the beginning of the sev - enth century. 16 Many Arabs had been
influenced by the Messianic expec- tations of the Jews; they, too,
eagerly awaited a messenger from God. One Arab sect, the Hanifs, already
rejected the heathen idolatry of the Kaaba, and preached a universal
God, of whom all mankind should be willing slaves. 17 Like every
successful preacher, Mohammed gave voice and form to the need and
longing of his time.</p>
<p>As he approached forty he became more and more absorbed in religion.
During the holy month of Ramadan he would withdraw, sometimes with his
family, to a cave at the foot of Mt. Hira, three miles from Mecca, and
spend many days and nights in fasting, meditation, and prayer. One night
in the year 610, as he was alone in the cave, the pivotal experience of
all Moham- medan history came to him. According to a tradition reported
by his chief biographer, Muhammad ibn Ishaq, Mohammed related the event
as follows:</p>
<p>Whilst I was asleep, with a coverlet of silk brocade whereon was</p>
<p>some writing, the angel Gabriel appeared to me and said, “Read!”
I</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>said, “I do not read.” He pressed me with the coverlets so tightly
that methought ’twas death. Then he let me go, and said, “Read!” … So
I</p>
<p>read aloud, and he departed from me at last. And I awoke from my</p>
<p>sleep, and it was as though these words were written on my heart. I
went forth until, when I was midway on the mountain, I heard a voice
from heaven saying, “O Mohammed! thou art the messenger of Allah, and I
am Gabriel.” I raised my head toward heaven to see, and lo, Ga- briel in
the form of a man, with feet set evenly on the rim of the sky, saying,
“O Mohammed! thou art the messenger of Allah, and I am</p>
<p>Gabriel .” 18</p>
<p>Returning to Khadija, he informed her of the visions. We are told
that she accepted them as a true revelation from heaven, and encouraged
him to an- nounce his mission.</p>
<p>Thereafter he had many similar visions. Often, when they came, he
fell to the ground in a convulsion or swoon; perspiration covered his
brow; even the camel on which he was sitting felt the excitement, and
moved fitfully . 19 Mohammed later attributed his gray hairs to these
experiences. When pressed to describe the process of revelation, he
answered that the entire text of the Koran existed in heaven , 20 and
that one fragment at a time was communicated to him, usually by Gabriel
. 21 Asked how he could remember these divine discourses, he explained
that the archangel made him repeat every word . 22 Others who were near
the Prophet at the time neither saw nor heard the angel . 23 Possibly
his convulsions were epileptic seizures; they were sometimes accompanied
by a sound reported by him as like the ringing of a bell 24 — a frequent
occurrence in epileptic fits. But we hear of no tongue- biting, no loss
of prehensile strength, such as usually occurs in epilepsy; nor does
Mohammed’s history show that degeneration of brain power which epilepsy
generally brings; on the contrary, he advanced in clarity of thought and
in confident leadership and power until his sixtieth year . 25 The
evidence is inconclusive; at least it has not sufficed to convince any
orthodox Moham- medan.</p>
<p>During the next four years Mohammed more and more openly announced
himself as the prophet of Allah, divinely commissioned to lead the Arab
peo- ple to a new morality and a monotheistic faith. Difficulties were
many. New ideas are welcomed only if promising early material advantage;
and Moham- med lived in a mercantile, skeptical community, which derived
some of its revenues from pilgrims c oming to worship the Kaaba’s many
gods. Against this handicap he made some progress by offering to
believers an escape from a threatened hell into a joyous and tangible
paradise. He opened his house to all who would hear him — rich and poor
and slaves, Arabs and Christians and Jews; and his impassioned eloquence
moved a few to belief. His first convert was his aging wife; the second
his cousin Ali; the third his servant Zaid, whom he had bought as a
slave and had immediately freed; the fourth was</p>
<p>MOHAMMED</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>his kinsman Abu Bekr, a man of high standing among the Quraish. Abu
Bekr brought to the new faith five other Meccan leaders; he and these
became the Prophet’s six “Companions,” whose memories of him would later
constitute the most revered traditions of Islam. Mohammed went often to
the Kaaba, accosted pilgrims, and preached the one god. The Quraish
heard him at first with smiling patience, called him a half-wit, and
proposed to send him, at their own expense, to a physician who might
cure him of his madness. 26 But when he attacked the Kaaba worship as
idolatry they rose to the protection of their income, and would have
done him injury had not his uncle Abu Talib shielded him. Abu Talib
would have none of the new faith, but his very fidelity to old ways
required him to defend any member of his clan.</p>
<p>Fear of a blood feud deterred the Quraish from using violence upon
Mo- hammed or his freemen followers. Upon converted slaves, however,
they might employ dissuasive measures without offending tribal law.
Several of these were jailed; some were exposed for hours, without head
covering or drink, to the glare of the sun. Abu Bekr had by years of
commerce saved 40,000 pieces of silver; now he used 35,000 to buy the
freedom of as many converted slaves as he could; and Mohammed eased the
situation by ruling that recantation under duress was forgivable. The
Quraish were more dis- turbed by Mohammed’s welcome to slaves than by
his religious creed. 27 Per - secution of the poorer converts continued,
and with such severity that the Prophet permitted or advised their
emigration to Abyssinia. The refugees were well received there by the
Christian king (615).</p>
<p>A year later an event occurred which was almost as significant for
Mo- hammedanism as the conversion of Paul had been for Christianity.
Omar ibn al-Khattab, hitherto a most violent opponent, was won over to
the new creed. He was a man of great physical strength, social power,
and moral courage. His allegiance brought timely confidence to the
harassed believers, and new adherents to the cause. Instead of hiding
their worship in private homes they now preached it boldly in the
streets. The defenders of the Kaaba gods formed a league pledged to
renounce all intercourse with mem- bers of the Hashimite clan who still
felt obligated to shield Mohammed. To avert conflict, many Hashimites,
including Mohammed and his family, with- drew to a secluded quarter of
Mecca, where Abu Talib could provide pro- tection (615). For over two
years this separation of the clans continued, until some members of the
Quraish, relenting, invited the Hashimites to re- turn to their deserted
homes, and pledged them peace.</p>
<p>The little group of converts rejoiced, but the year 619 brought
triple mis- fortune to Mohammed. Khadija, his most loyal supporter, and
Abu Talib, his protector, died. Feeling insecure in Mecca, and
discouraged by the slow in- crease of his followers there, Mohammed
moved to Taif (620), a pleasant town sixty miles east. But Taif rejected
him. Its leaders did not care to offend the merchant aristocracy of
Mecca; its populace, horrified by any religious</p>
<p>1 66 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>innovation, hooted him through the streets, and pelted him with
stones until blood flowed from his legs. Back in Mecca, he married the
widow Sauda, and betrothed himself, aged fifty, to Aisha, the pretty and
petulant seven- year-old daughter of Abu Bekr.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his visions continued. One night, it seemed to him, he was
miraculously transported in his sleep to Jerusalem; there a winged
horse, Buraq, awaited him at the Wailing Wall of the Jewish Temple
ruins, flew him to heaven, and back again; and by another miracle the
Prophet found himself, the next morning, safe in his Mecca bed. The
legend of this flight made Jerusalem a third holy city for Islam.</p>
<p>In the year 620 Mohammed preached to merchants who had come from
Medina on pilgrimage to the Kaaba; they heard him with some acceptance,
for the doctrine of monotheism, a divine messenger, and the Last
Judgment were familiar to them from the creed of the Medina Jews.
Returning to their city, some of them expounded the new gospel to their
friends; several Jews, seeing little difference between Mohammed’s
teaching and th eir own, gave it a tentative welcome; and in 622 some
seventy-three citizens of Medina came privately to Mohammed and invited
him to make Medina his home. He asked would they protect him as
faithfully as their own families; they vowed they would, but asked what
reward they would receive should they be killed in the process. He
answered, paradise. 28</p>
<p>About this time Abu Sufyan, grandson of Umayya, became the head of
the Meccan Quraish. Having been brought up in an odor of hatred for all
descendants of Hashim, he renewed the persecution of Mohammed’s fol -
lowers. Possibly he had heard that the Prophet was meditating flight,
and feared that Mohammed, once established in Medina, might stir it to
war against Mecca and the Kaaba cult. At his urging, the Quraish
commissioned some of their number to apprehend Mohammed, perhaps to kill
him. Ap- prised of the plot, Mohammed fled with Abu Bekr to the cave of
Thaur, a league distant. The Quraish emissaries sought them for three
days, but failed to find them. The children of Abu Bekr brought camels,
and the two men rode northward through the night, and through many days
for 200 miles, until, on September 24, 622, they arrived at Medina. Two
hundred Meccan adherents had preceded them in the guise of departing
pilgrims, and stood at the city’s gates, with the Medina converts, to
welcome the Prophet.</p>

<p>The city hitherto called Yathrib, later renamed Medinat al- Nabi or

<p>plateau. Compared with Mecca it was a climatic Eden, with hundreds of
gardens, palm groves, and farms. As Mohammed rode into the town one
group after another called to him, “Alight here, O Prophet! . . . Abide
with us! and with Arab persistence some caught the halter of his camel
to detain him. His answer was perfect diplomacy: “The choice lies with
the camel; let him advance freely”; 29 the advice quieted jealousy, and
hallowed his new residence as chosen by God. Where his camel stopped,
Mohammed built a mosque and two adjoining homes — one for Sauda, one for
Aisha; later he added new apartments as he took new wives.</p>
<p>In leaving Mecca he had snapped many kinship ties; now he tried to
re- place bonds of blood with those of religious brotherhood in a
theocratic state. To mitigate the jealousy already rampant between the
Refugees ( Mu - hajirin) from Mecca and the Helpers {Ansar) or converts
in Medina, he coupled each member of the one group with a member of the
other in adop- tive brotherhood, and called both groups to worship in
sacred union in the mosque. In the first ceremony held there he mounted
the pulpit and cried in a loud voice, “Allah is most great!” The
assembly burst forth in the same proclamation. Then, still standing with
his back to the congregation, he bowed in prayer. He descended the
pulpit backward, and at its foot he pros- trated himself thrice, while
continuing to pray. In these prostrations were symbolized that
submission of the soul to Allah which gave to the new faith its name
Islam — “to surrender,” “to make peace”— and to its adherents the
kindred name of Muslimin or Moslems — “the surrendering ones,” “thosf
who have made their peace with God.” Turning then to the assembly, Mo -
hammed bade it observe this ritual to the end of time; and to this day
it is the form of prayer that Moslems follow, whether at the mosque, or
traveling in the desert, or mosqueless in alien lands. A sermon
completed the ceremony, often announcing, in Mohammed’s case, a new
revelation, and directing the actions and policies of the week.</p>
<p>For the authority of the Prophet was creating a civic rule for
Medina; and more and more he was compelled to address his time and
inspirations to the practical problems of social organization, daily
morals, even to intertribal diplomacy and war. As in Judaism, no
distinction was made between secular and religious affairs; all alike
came under religious jurisdiction; he was both Caesar and Christ. But
not all Medinites accepted his authority. A majority of the Arabs stood
aside as “the Disaffected,” viewed the new creed and its ritual
skeptically, and wondered whether Mohammed was destroying their
traditions and liberties, and involving them in war. Most of the Medina
Jews clung to their own faith, and continued to trade with the Meccan
Quraish. Mohammed drew up with these Jews a subtle concordat:</p>
<p>The Jews who attach themselves to our commonwealth shall be pro-
tected from all insults and vexations; they shall have an equal
right</p>
<p>with our own people to our assistance and good offices; they . .
.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>1 68</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>shall form with the Moslems one composite nation; they shall
practice</p>
<p>their religion as freely as the Moslems They shall join the
Moslems</p>
<p>in defending Yathrib against all enemies. . . . All future disputes
be-</p>
<p>tween those who accept this charter shall be referred, under God, to
the Prophet. 30</p>
<p>This agreement was soon accepted by all the Jewish tribes of Medina
and the surrounding country: the Banu-Nadhir, the Banu-Kuraiza, the
Banu- Kainuka</p>
<p>The immigration of two hundred Meccan families created a food
shortage in Medina. Mohammed solved the problem as starving people do —
by taking food where it could be had. In commissioning his lieutenants
to raid the cara- vans that passed Medina, he was adopting the morals of
most Arab tribes in his time. When the raids succeeded, four fifths of
the spoils went to the raiders, one fifth to the Prophet for religious
and charitable uses; the share of a slain raider went to his widow, and
he himself at once entered paradise. So encouraged, raids and raiders
multiplied, while the merchants of Mecca, whose economic life depended
on the security of the caravans, plotted re- venge. One raid scandalized
Medina as well as Mecca, for it took place — and killed a man — on the
last day of Rajab, one of the sacred months when Arab morality laid a
moratorium on violence. In 623 Mohammed himself orga- nized a band of
300 armed men to waylay a rich caravan coming from Syria to Mecca. Abu
Sufyan, who commanded the caravan, got wind of the plan, changed his
route, and sent to Mecca for help. The Quraish came 900 strong. The
miniature armies met at the Wadi * Bedr, twenty miles south of Medina.
If Mohammed had been defeated his career might have ended there and
then. He personally led his men to victory, ascribed it to Allah as a
miracle con- firming his leadership, and returned to Medina with rich
booty and many prisoners (January, 624). Some of these, who had been
especially active in the persecution at Mecca, were put to death; the
rest were freed for lucrative ransoms. 31 But Abu Sufyan survived, and
promised revenge. “Weep not for your slain,” he told mourning relatives
in Mecca, “and let no bard bewail their fate. . . . Haply the turn may
come, and ye may obtain vengeance. As for me, I will touch no oil,
neither approach my wife, until I shall have gone forth again to fight
Mohammed.” 32</p>
<p>Strengthened by victory, Mohammed used the customary morality of war.
Asma, a Medinese poetess, having attacked him in her rhymes, Omeir, a
blind Moslem, made his way into her room, and plunged his sword so fer-
vently into the sleeping woman’s breast that it affixed her to the
couch. In the mosque the next morning Mo hammed asked Omeir, “Hast thou
slain Asma?” “Yes,” answered Omeir, “is there cause for apprehension?”
“None,” said the Prophet; “a couple of goats will hardly knock their
heads together for it.” 33 Afak, a centenarian convert to Judaism,
composed a sati re on the</p>
<p>A river bed or valley usually dry in summer.</p>
<p>MOHAMMED</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Prophet, and was slain as he slept in his courtyard. 34 A third
Medinese poet, Kab ibn al-Ashraf, son of a Jewess, abandoned Islam when
Mohammed turned against the Jews; he wrote verses prodding the Quraish
to avenge their defeat, and enraged the Moslems by addressing love
sonnets to their wives in premature troubadour style. “Who will ease me
of this man?” asked Mohammed. That evening the poet’s severed head was
laid at the Prophet’s feet. 85 In the Moslem view these executions were
a legitimate defense against treason; Mohammed was the head of a state,
and had full authority to con- demn. 36</p>
<p>The Jews of Medina no longer liked this warlike faith, which had once
seemed so flatteringly kindred to their own. They laughed at Mohammed’s
interpretations of their Scriptures, and his claim to be the Messiah
promised by their prophets. He retaliated with revelations in which
Allah charged the Jews with corrupting the Scriptures, killing the
prophets, and rejecting the Messiah. Originally he had made Jerusalem
the qibla — the point toward which Moslems should turn in prayer; in 624
he changed this to Mecca and the Kaaba. The Jews accused him of
returning to idolatry. About this time a Moslem girl visited the market
of the Banu-Kainuka Jews in Medina; as she sat in a goldsmith’s shop a
mischievous Jew pinned her skirt behind her to her upper dress. When she
arose she cried out in shame at her exposure. A Mos- lem slew the
offending Jew, whose brothers then slew the Moslem. Moham- med marshaled
his followers, blockaded the Banu-Kainuka Jews in their quarter for
fifteen days, accepted their surrender, and bade them, 700 in number,
depart from Medina, and leave all their possessions behind.</p>
<p>We must admire the restraint of Abu Sufyan, who, after his unnatural
vow, waited a year before going forth to battle Mohammed again. Early in
625 he led an army of 3000 men to the hill of Ohod, three miles north of
M edina. Fifteen women, including Abu Sufyan’s wives, accompanied the
army, and stirred it to fervor with wild songs of sorrow and revenge.
Mo- hammed could muster only a thousand warriors. The Moslems were
routed; Mohammed fought bravely, received many wounds, and was carried
half un- conscious from the field. Abu Sufyan’s chief wife Hind, whose
father, uncle, and brother had been slain at Bedr, chewed the liver of
the fallen Hamza — who had slain her father — and made anklets and
bracelets for herself from Hamza’s skin and nails. 37 Thinking Mohammed
safely dead, Abu Sufyan re - turned in triumph to Mecca. Six months
later the Prophet was sufficiently recovered to attack the Banu-Nadhir
Jews, charging them with helping the Quraish and plotting against his
life. After three weeks’ siege they were al - lowed to emigrate, each
family taking with it as much as a camel could carry. Mohammed
appropriated some of their rich date orchards for the support of his
household, and distributed the remainder among the Refugees. 38 He con-
sidered himself at war with Mecca, and felt justified in removing
hostile groups from his flanks.</p>
<p>170 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>In 626 Abu Sufyan and the Quraish resumed the offensive, this time
with 10,000 men, and with material aid from the Banu-Kuraiza Jews.
Unable to meet such a force in battle, Mohammed defended Medina by
having a trench dug around it. The Quraish laid siege for twenty days;
then, disheartened by wind and rain, they returned to their homes.
Mohammed at once led 3000 men against the Banu-Kuraiza Jews. On
surrendering, they were given a choice of Islam or death. They chose
death. Their 600 fighting men were slain and buried in the market place
of Medina; their women and children were sold into slavery.</p>
<p>The Prophet had by this time become an able general. During his ten
years in Medina he planned sixty-five campaigns and raids, and
personally led twenty-seven. But he was also a diplomat, and knew when
war should be continued by means of peace. He shared the longings of the
Refugees to see their Meccan homes and families, and of both Refugees
and Helpers to visit again the Kaaba that had in their youth been the
hearth of their piety. As the first apostles thought of Christianity as
a form and reform of Judaism, so the Moslems thought of Mohammedanism as
a change and development of the ancient Meccan ritual. In 628 Mohammed
sent the Quraish an offer of peace, pledging the safety of their
caravans in return for permission to fulfill the rites of the annual
pilgrimage. The Quraish replied that a year of peace must precede this
consent. Mohammed shocked his followers by agreeing; a ten years’ truce
was signed; and the Prophet consoled his raiders by attacking and
plundering the Khaibar Jews in their settlement six days’ journey north
- east of Medina. The Jews defended themselves as well as they could;
ninety- three of them died in the attempt; the rest at last surrendered.
They were allowed to remain and cultivate the soil, but on condition of
yielding all their property, and half their future produce, to the
conqueror. All the survivors were spared except Kinana, their chieftain,
and his cousin, who were be- headed for hiding some of their wealth.
Safiya, a seventeen-year-old Jewish damsel, betrothed to Kinana, was
taken by Mohammed as an added wife. 39 In 629 the Medina Moslems, to the
number of 2000, entered Mecca peace- fully; and while the Quraish, to
avoid mutual irritations, retired to the hills, Mohammed and his
followers made seven circuits of the Kaaba. The Prophet touched the
Black Stone reverently with his staff, but led the Moslems in shouting,
“There is no god but Allah alone!” Meccans were impressed by the orderly
behavior and patriotic piety of the exiles; several influential Quraish,
including the future generals Khalid and Amr, adopted the new faith; and
some tribes in the neighboring desert offered Mohammed the pledge of
their belief for the support of his arms. When he returned to Medina he
calculated that he was now strong enough to take Mecca by force.</p>
<p>The ten years’ truce had eight years to run; but Mohammed alleged
that a tribe allied with the Quraish had attacked a Moslem tribe, and
thereby voided the truce (630). He gathered 10,000 men, and marched to
Mecca.</p>

<p>171</p>
<p>Abu Sufyan, perceiving the strength of Mohammed’s forces, allowed him
to enter unopposed. Mohammed responded handsomely by declaring a general
amnesty for all but two or three of his enemies. He destroyed the idols
in and around the Kaaba, but spared the Black Stone, and sanctioned the
kissing of it. He proclaimed Mecca the Holy City of Islam, and decreed
that no un- believer should ever be allowed to set foot on its sacred
soil. The Quraish abandoned direct opposition; and the buffeted preacher
who had fled from Mecca eight years before was now master of all its
life.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MOHAMMED VICTORIOUS: 6 3 0-2</li>
</ol>
<p>His two remaining years — spent mostly at Medina — were a continuing
tri- umph. After some minor rebellions all Arabia submitted to his
authority and creed. The most famous Arabian poet of the time, Kab ibn
Zuhair, who had written a diatribe against him, came in person to
Medina, surrendered himself to Mohammed, proclaimed himself a convert,
received pardon, and com- posed so eloquent a poem in honor of the
Prophet that Mohammed bestowed his mantle upon him.* In return for a
moderate tribute the Christians of Arabia were taken under Mohammed’s
protection, and enjoyed full liberty of worship, but they were forbidden
to charge interest on loans . 41 We are told that he sent envoys to the
Greek emperor, the Persian king, and the rulers of Hira and Ghassan,
inviting them to accept the new faith; apparently there was no reply. He
observed with philosophic resignation the mutual de- struction in which
Persia and Byzantium were engaged; but he does not seem to have
entertained any thought of extending his power outside of Arabia.</p>
<p>His days were filled with the chores of government. He gave himself
con- scientiously to details of legislation, judgment, and civil,
religious, and mili- tary organization. One of his least inspired acts
was his regulation of the calendar. This had consisted among the Arabs,
as among the Jews, of twelve lunar months, with an intercalary month
every three years to renew concord with the sun. Mohammed ruled that the
Moslem year should always consist of twelve lunar months, of alternately
thirty and twenty-nine days; as a re- sult the Moslem calendar lost all
harmony with the seasons, and gained a year upon the Gregorian calendar
every thirty-two and a half years. The Prophet was not a scientific
legislator; he drew up no code or digest, had no system; he issued
edicts according to the occasion; if contradictions devel- oped he
smoothed them with new revelations that sternly superseded the old . 42
Even his most prosaic directives might be presented as revelations from
Allah. Harassed by the necessity of adapting this lofty method to
mundane affairs, his style lost something of its former eloquence and
poetry; but per-</p>

<p>haps he felt that this was small price to pay for having all his
legislation bear the awesome stamp of deity. At the same time he could
be charmingly mod- est. More than once he admitted his ignorance. He
protested against being taken for more than a fallible and mortal man .
43 He claimed no power to pre- dict the future or to perform miracles.
However, he was not above using the method of revelation for very human
and personal ends, as when a special message from Allah 44 sanctioned
his desire to marry the pretty wife of Zaid, his adopted son.</p>
<p>His ten wives and two concubines have been a source of marvel, merri-
ment, and envy to the Western world. We must continually remind our-
selves that the high death rate of the male among the ancient and early
me- dieval Semites lent to polygamy, in Semitic eyes, the aspect of a
biological necessity, almost a moral obligation. Mohammed took polygamy
for granted, and indulged himself in marriage with a clear conscience
and no morbid sensuality. Aisha, in a tradition of uncertain authority,
quoted him as saying that the three most precious things in this world
are women, fragrant odors, and prayers . 45 Some of his marriages were
acts of kindness to the desti- tute widows of followers or friends, as
in the cas e of Omar’s daughter Hafsa; some were diplomatic marriages,
as in the case of Hafsa — to bind Omar to him — and the daughter of Abu
Sufyan — to win an enemy. Some may have been due to a perpetually
frustrated hope for a son. All his wives after Kha- dija were barren,
which subjected the Prophet to much raillery. Of the chil- dren borne to
him by Khadija only one survived him — Fatima. Mary, a Cop- tic slave
presented to him by the Negus of Abyssinia, rejoiced him, in the last
year of his life, with a son; but Ibrahim died after fifteen months.</p>
<p>His crowded harem troubled him with quarrels, jealousies, and demands
for pin money . 46 He refused to indulge the extravagance of his wives,
but he promised them paradise; and for a time he dutifully spent a night
with each of them in rotation; the master of Arabia had no apartment of
his own . 47 The alluring and vivacious Aisha, however, won so many
attentions out of her turn that the other wives rebelled, until the
matter was settled by a special revelation:</p>
<p>Thou canst defer whom thou wilt of them, and receive of them whom
thou wilt; and whomsoever thou desirest of those whom thou hast set
aside, it is no sin for thee; that is better, that they may be comforted
and not grieve, and may all be pleased with what thou givest them . 48
Women and power were his only indulgence; for the rest he was a man of
unassuming simplicity. The apartments in which he successively dwelt
were cottages of unburnt brick, twelve or fourteen feet square, eight
feet high, and thatched with palm branches; the door was a screen of
goat or camel hair; the furniture was a mattress and pillows spread upon
the floor . 49 He was often seen mending his clothes or shoes, kindling
the fire, sweeping the floor.</p>

<p>173</p>
<p>milking the family goat in his yard, or shopping for provisions in
the mar- ket . 50 He ate with his fingers, and licked them thriftily
after each meal . 51 His staple foods were dates and barley bread; milk
and honey were occasional luxuries; 52 and he obeyed his own
interdiction of wine. Courteous to the great, affable to the humble,
dignified to the presumptuous, indulgent to his aides, kindly to all but
his foes — so his friends and followers describe him . 53 He visited the
sick, and joined any funeral procession that he met. He put on none of
the pomp of power, rejected any special mark of reverence, accepted the
invitation of a slave to dinner, and asked no service of a slave that he
had time and strength to do for himself . 54 Despite all the booty and
revenue that came to him, he spent little upon his family, less upon
himself, much in charity . 55</p>
<p>But, like all men, he was vain. He gave considerable time to his
personal appearance — perfumed his body, painted his eyes, dyed his
hair, and wore a ring inscribed “Mohammed the Messenger of Allah”; 56
perhaps this was for signing documents. His voice was hypnotically
musical. His senses were painfully keen; he could not bear evil odors,
jangling bells, or loud talk. “Be modest in thy bearing,” he taught,
“and subdue thy voice. Lo, the harshest of all voices is that of the
ass.” 57 He was nervous and restless, subject to oc - casional
melancholy, then suddenly talkative and gay. He had a sly humor. To Abu
Horairah, who visited him with consuming frequency, he sug- gested: “O
Abu Horairah! let me alone every other day, that so affection may
increase.” 58 He was an unscrupulous warrior, and a just judge. He could
be cruel and treacherous, but his acts of mercy were numberless. He
stopped many barbarous superstitions, such as blinding part of a herd to
pro- pitiate the evil eye, or tying a dead man’s camel to his grave . 50
His friends loved him to idolatry. His followers collected his spittle,
or his cut hair, or the water in which he had washed his hands,
expecting from these objects magic cures for their infirmities . 60</p>
<p>His own health and energy had borne up well through all the tasks of
love and war. But at the age of fifty-nine he began to fail. A year
previously, he thought, the people of Khaibar had served him poisonous
meat; since then he had been subject to strange fevers and spells; in
the dead of night, Aisha reported, he would steal from the house, visit
a graveyard, ask forgiveness of the dead, pray aloud for them, and
congratulate them on being dead. Now, in his sixty-third year, these
fevers became more exhausting. One night Aisha complained of a headache.
He complained of one also, and asked play- fully would she not prefer to
die first, and have the advantage of being buried by the Prophet of
Allah — to which she replied, with her customary tartness, that he would
doubtless, on returning from her grave, install a fresh bride in her
place . 61 For fourteen days thereafter the fever came and went. Three
days before his death he rose from his sickbed, walked into the mosque,
saw Abu Bekr leading the prayers in his stead, and humbly sat beside him
during</p>

<p>the ceremony. On June 7, 632, after a long agony, he passed away, his
head on Aisha’s breast.</p>
<p>If we judge greatness by influence, he was one of the giants of
history. He undertook to raise the spiritual and moral level of a people
harassed into bar- barism by heat and foodless wastes, and he succeeded
more completely than any other reformer; seldom has any man so fully
realized his dream. He ac- complished his purpose through religion not
only because he himself was re- ligious, but because no other medium
could have moved the Arabs of his time; he appealed to their
imagination, their fears and hopes, and spoke in terms that they could
understand. When he began, Arabia was a desert flot- sam of idolatrous
tribes; when he died it was a nation. He restrained fanati- cism and
superstition, but he used them. Upon Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and his
native creed he built a religion simple and clear and strong, and a
morality of ruthless courage and racial pride, which in a generation
marched to a hundred victories, in a century to empire, and remains to
this day a virile force through half the world.</p>
