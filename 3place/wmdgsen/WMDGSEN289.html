<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>Byzantine Civilization</p>
<p>326-565</p>
<p>I. WORK AND WEALTH</p>
<p>B YZANTINE economy was a modernistic mixture of private enterprise,
state regulation, and nationalized industries. Peasant proprietorship
was still, under Justinian, the agricultural rule; but estates were
expanding, and many farmers were being forced into feudal subjection to
great landowners by drought or flood, competition or incompetence,
taxation or war. The mineral resources of the soil were owned by the
state, but were mostly mined by private agencies on governmental lease.
The mines of Greece were ex- hausted, but old and new veins were worked
in Thrace, Pontus, and the Bal- kans. Most industrial labor was “free”—
i.e., compelled only by a distaste for starvation. Direct slavery played
a negligible role outside of domestic serv- ices and the textile
industry; but in Syria, and probably in Egypt and North Africa, forced
labor was used by the state to maintain the major irrigation canals. 1
The government produced in its own factories most of the goods required
by the army, the bureaucracy, and the court. 2</p>
<p>About the year 552 some Nestorian monks from Central Asia interested
Justinian with an offer to provide the Empire with an independent source
of silk. If we recall how many wars Greece and Rome had fought with
Persia for control of the trade routes to China and India, and remark
the name “silk route” given to the northern passes to the Far East, the
name Serica (Silk - land) given by the Romans to China, and the name
Serindia applied to the region between China and India, we shall
understand why Justinian eagerly accepted the proposal. The monks went
back to Central Asia and returned with the eggs of silkworms, and
probably some seedlings of the mulberry tree. 3 A small silk industry
already existed in Greece, but it depended upon wild silkworms, feeding
on oak, ash, or cypress leaves. Now silk became a major industry,
especially in Syria and Greece; it developed to such an ex- tent in the
Peloponnesus as to give that peninsula the new name of Morea — land of
the mulberry tree ( morus alba ) .</p>
<p>In Constantinople the manufacture of certain silk fabrics and purple
dyes was a state monopoly, and was carried on in workshops in or near
the im- perial palace. 4 Expensive silks and dyed fabrics were permitted
only to high officials of the government, and the most costly could be
worn only by mem-</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION 119</p>
<p>bers of the imperial family. When clandestine private enterprise
produced and sold similar stuffs to unprivileged persons , Justinian
broke this “black market” by removing most of the restrictions on the
use of luxurious silks and dyes; he flooded the shops with state
textiles at prices that private com- petition could not meet; and when
the competition had disappeared the gov- ernment raised the prices. 5
Following Diocletian’s example, Justinian sought to extend governmental
control to all prices and wages. After the plague of 542 the labor
supply fell, wages rose, and prices soared. Like the English Parliament
of 1 35 1 after the plague of 1 348, Justinian sought to help employ-
ers and consumers by a price and wage decree:</p>
<p>We have learned that since the visitation of God traders,
artisans,</p>
<p>husbandmen, and sailors have yielded to a spirit of covetousness, and
are demanding prices and wages two or three times as great as they</p>
<p>formerly received We forbid all such to demand higher wages or</p>
<p>prices than before. We also forbid contractors for buildings, or
for</p>
<p>agricultural or other work, to pay the workmen more than was cus-</p>
<p>tomary in old days. 6</p>
<p>We have no information as to the effect of this decree.</p>
<p>From Constantine to the latter part of Justinian’s reign domestic and
for - eign trade flourished in the Byzantine Empire. Roman roads and
bridges were there kept in repair, and the creative lust for gain built
maritime fleets that bound the capital with a hundred ports in East and
West. From the fifth century to the fifteenth Constantinople remained
the greatest market and shipping center in the world. Alexandria, which
had held this supremacy from the third century b.c., now ranked in trade
below Antioch. 7 All Syria throve with commerce and industry; it lay
between Persia and Constanti- nople, between Constantinople and Egypt;
its merchants were shrewd and venturesome, and only the effervescent
Greeks could rival them in the extent of their traffic and the subtlety
of their ways; their spread throughout the Empire was a factor in that
orientalization of manners and arts which marked Byzantine
civilization.</p>
<p>As the old trade route from Syria to Central Asia lay through
hostile</p>
<p>Persia, Justinian sought a new route by establishing friendly
relations with the Himyarites of southwestern Arabia and the kings of
Ethiopia, who be- tween them controlled the southern gates of the Red
Sea. Through those straits and the Indian Ocean Byzantine merchantmen
sailed to India; but Persian control of Indian ports wrung the same
tolls from this trade as if it had passed through Iran. Defeated on this
line, Justinian encouraged the de- velopment of harbors on the Black
Sea; along these stopping points goods were shipped by water to Colchis,
and thence by caravan to Sogdiana, where Chinese and Western merchants
could meet and haggle without Persian scrutiny. The rising traffic on
this northern route helped to raise Serindia to</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>its medieval peak of wealth and art. Meanwhile Greek commerce
maintained its ancient outlets in the West.</p>
<p>This active economy was supported by an imperial currency whose in-
tegrity gave it an almost global acceptance. Constantine had minted a
new coin to replace Caesar’s aureus - , this solidus or “bezant”
contained 4.55 grams, or one sixth of a troy ounce of gold, and would be
worth .83 in the United States of 1946. The metallic and economic
deterioration of the solidus into the lowly sou illustrates the general
rise of prices, and depreciation of cur- rencies, through history, and
suggests that thrift is a virtue which, like most others, must be
practiced with discrimination. Banking was now highly de- veloped. We
may judge the prosperity of the Byzantine Empire at Justinian’s
accession by his fixing of the maximum interest rate at four per cent on
loans to peasants, six per cent on private loans secured by collateral,
eight per cent on commercial loans, and twelve per cent on maritime
investments. 8 No- where else in the world of that time were interest
rates so low.</p>
<p>The senatorial aristocracy through land ownership, and the mercantile
magnates through far-flung ventures in which the profits were commensu-
rate with the risks, enjoyed such wealth and luxury as only a few had
ever known in Rome. The aristocracy of the East had better tastes than
that of Rome in the days of Cicero or Juvenal; it did not gorge itself
on exotic foods, had a lower rate of divorce, and showed considerable
fidelity and industry in serving the state. Its extravagance lay chiefly
in ornate dress, in robes of furry hems and dazzling tints, in silken
tunics preciously dyed, threaded with gold, and illuminated with scenes
from nature or history. Some men were “walking murals”; on the garments
of one senator could be found the whole story of Christ. 9 Underneath
this social crust of gold was a middle class fretted with taxation, a
plodding bureaucracy, a medley of meddlesome monks, a flotsam and jetsam
of proletaires exploited by the price system and soothed by the
dole.</p>
<p>Morals, sexual and commercial, were not appreciably different from
those of other cultures at a like stage of economic development.
Chrysostom con- demned dancing as exciting passion, but Constantinople
danced. The Church continued to refuse baptism to actors, but the
Byzantine stage continued to display its suggestive pantomimes; people
must be consoled for monogamy and prose. Procopius’ Secret History ,
never trustworthy, reports that “prac - tically all women were corrupt”
in his time. 10 Contraceptives were a subject of assiduous study and
research; Oribasius, the outstanding physician of the fourth century,
gave them a chapter in his compendium of medicine; another medical
writer, Aetius, in the sixth century, recommended the use of vinegar or
brine, or the practice of continence at the beginning and end of the
men- strual period. 11 Justinian and Theodora sought to diminish
prostitution by banishing procuresses and brothel keepers from
Constantinople, with tran-</p>

<p>sient results. In general the status of woman was high; never had
women been more unfettered in law and custom, or more influential in
government.</p>

<li>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY: 364-565</li>
</ol>
<p>What, in this apparently religious society, was the fate of
education, learn- ing, literature, science, and philosophy?</p>
<p>Primary instruction continued in the hands of private teachers paid
by the parents per pupil and term. Higher education, till Theodosius II,
was pro- vided both by lecturers operating under their own power, and
through pro- fessors-paid by city or state. Libanius complained that
these were too poorly paid — that they longed through hunger to go to
the baker, but refrained through fear of being asked to pay their debts.
12 However, we read of teachers like Eumenius, who received 600,000
sesterces (0,000?) a year; 13 in this, as in other fields, the best and
the worst received too much, the rest too little. Julian, to propagate
paganism, introduced state examinations and appointments for all
university teachers. 14 Theodosius II, for opposite rea- sons, made it a
penal offense to give public instruction without a state license; and
such licenses were soon confined to conformists with the orthodox
creed.</p>
<p>The great universities of the East were at Alexandria, Athens,
Constanti- nople, and Antioch, specializing respectively in medicine,
philosophy, litera- ture, and rhetoric. Oribasius of Pergamum ( c .
325-403), physician to Julian, compiled a medical encyclopedia of
seventy “books.” Aetius of Amida, court physician under Justinian, wrote
a similar survey, distinguished by the best ancient analysis of ailments
of the eye, ear, nose, mouth, and teeth; with in- teresting chapters on
goiter and hydrophobia, and surgical procedures rang- ing from
tonsillectomy to hemorrhoids. Alexander of Tralles ( c . 525-605) was
the most original of these medical authors: he named various intestinal
parasites, accurately described disorders of the digestive tract, and
discussed with unprecedented thoroughness the diagnosis and treatment of
pulmonary diseases. His textbook of internal pathology and therapy was
translated into Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin, and exercised in
Christendom an influ- ence only next to that of Hippocrates, Galen, and
Soranus. 35 According to Augustine the vivisection of human beings was
practiced in the fifth cen- tury. 16 Superstition encroached daily on
medicine. Most pjhysicians accepted astrology, and some advised
different treatments according to the position of the planets. 17 Aetius
recommended, for contraception, that the woman should suspend near her
anus the tooth of a child; 18 and Marcellus, in his De medicameiitis (39
5), anticipated modern technique by urging the wear- ing of a rabbit’s
foot. 19 Mules fared better than men; the most scientific work</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>of the period was the Digestorum artis mulomedicinae libri IV of
Flavius Vegetius (383-450); this book almost founded veterinary science,
and re- mained an authority till the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Chemistry and alchemy went hand in hand, with Alexandria as their
cen- ter. The alchemists were generally sincere investigators; they
employed ex- perimental methods more faithfully than any other
scientists of antiquity; they substantially advanced the chemistry of
metals and alloys; and we can- not be sure that the future will not
justify their aims. Astrology too had an honest base; nearly everybody
took it for granted that the stars, as well as the sun and moon,
affected terrestrial events. But upon these foundations quack- ery
raised a weird ziggurat of magic, divination, and planetary abracadabra.
Horoscopes were even more fashionable in medieval cities than in New
York or Paris today. St. Augustine tells of two friends who noted
carefully the position of the constellations at the birth of their
domestic animals. 20 Much of the nonsense of Arabic astrology and
alchemy was part of Islam’s Greek heritage.</p>
<p>The most interesting figure in the science of this age is that of the
pagan mathematician and philosopher Hypatia. Her father Theon is the
last man whose name is recorded as a professor at the Alexandrian
Museum; he wrote a commentary on Ptolemy’s Syntaxis, and acknowledged
the share of his daughter in its composition. Hypatia, says Suidas,
wrote commentaries on Diophantus, on the Astronomical Canon of Ptolemy,
and on the Conics of Apollonius of Perga. 21 None of her works survives.
From mathematics she passed to philosophy, built her system on the lines
of Plato and Plotinus, and (according to the Christian historian So
crates) “far surpassed all the philoso - phers of her time.” 22
Appointed to the chair of philosophy in the Museum, she drew to her
lectures a large audience of varied and distant provenance. Some
students fell in love with her, but she Seems never to have married;
Suidas would have us believe that she married, but remained a virgin
never- theless. 23 Suidas transmits another tale, perhaps invented by
her enemies, that when one youth importuned her she impatiently raised
her dress, and said to him: “T his symbol of unclean generation is what
you are in love with, and not anything beautiful.” 24 She was so fond of
philosophy that she would stop in the streets and explain, to any who
asked, difficult points in Plato or Aristotle. “Such was her self -pos
session and ease of manner,” says Socrates, “arising from the refinement
and cultivation of her mind, that she not in - frequently appeared
before the city magistrates without ever losing in an assembly of men
that dignified modesty of deportment for which she was conspicuous, and
which gained for her universal respect and admiration.”</p>
<p>But the admiration was not quite universal. The Christians of
Alexandria must have looked upon her askance, for she was not only a
seductive un- believer, but an intimate friend of Orestes, the pagan
prefect of the city. When Archbishop Cyril instigated his monastic
followers to expel the Jews</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION 123</p>
<p>from Alexandria, Orestes sent to Theodosius II an offensively
impartial ac- count of the incident. Some monks stoned the prefect; he
had the leader of the mob arrested and tortured to death (415). Cyril’s
supporters charged Hypatia with being the chief influence upon Orestes;
she alone, they argued, prevented a reconciliation between the prefect
and the Patriarch. One day a band of fanatics, led by a “reader” or
minor clerk on Cyril’s staff, pulled her from her carriage, dragged her
into a church, stripped her of her garments, battered her to death with
tiles, tore her corpse to pieces, and burned the re- mains in a savage
orgy (41 5). 25 “An act so inhuman,” says Socrates, “could not fail to
bring the greatest opprobrium not only upon Cyril, but also upon the
whole Alexandrian church.” 20 However, no personal punishment was
exacted; the Emperor Theodosius II merely restricted the freedom of the
monks to appear in public (Sept., 416), and excluded pagans from all
public office (Dec., 416). Cyril’s victory was complete.</p>
<p>Pagan professors of philosophy, after the death of Hypatia, sought
se- curity in Athens, where non-Christian teaching was still relatively
and in- nocuously free. Student life was still lively there, and enjoyed
most of the consolations of higher education — fraternities, distinctive
garbs, hazing, and a general hilarity. 27 The Stoic as well as the
Epicurean School had now dis- appeared, but the Platonic Academy enjoyed
a splendid decline under The- mistius, Priscus, and Proclus. Themistius
(fl. 380) was destined to influence Averroes and other medieval thinkers
by his commentaries on Aristotle. Priscus was for a time the friend and
adviser of Julian; he was arrested by Valens and Valentinian I on a
charge of using magic to give them a fever; he returned to Athens, and
taught there till his death at ninety in 395. Proclus (410-85), like a
true Platonist, approached philosophy through mathe- matics. A man of
scholastic patience, he collated the ideas of Greek phi- losophy into
one system, and gave it a superficially scientific form. But he felt the
mystic mood of Neoplatonism too; by fasting and purification, he
thought, one might enter into communion with supernatural beings. 28 The
schools of Athens had lost all vitality when Justinian closed them in
529. Their work lay in rehearsing again and again the theories of the
ancient mas- ters; they were oppressed and stifled by the magnitude of
their heritage; their only deviations were into a mysticism that
borrowed from the less orthodox moods of Christianity. Justinian closed
the schools of the rhetoricians as well as of the philosophers,
confiscated their property, and forbade any pagan to teach. Greek
philosophy, after eleven centuries of history, had come to an end.</p>
<p>The passage from philosophy to religion, from Plato to Christ, stands
out in certain strange Greek writings confidently ascribed by medieval
thinkers to Dionysius “the Areopagite”— one of the Athenians who
accepted the teaching of Paul. These works are chiefly four: On the
Celestial Hierarchy , On the Ec- clesiastical Hierarchy , On the Divme
Names , and On Mystical Theology. We</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>I2 4</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>do not know by whom they were written, or when, or where; their
contents indicate an origin between the fourth and sixth centuries; we
only know that few books have more deeply influenced Christian theology.
John Scotus Erigena translated and built on one of them, Albertus Magnus
and Thomas Aquinas reverenced them, a hundred mystics — Jewish and
Moslem as well as Christian- fed on them, and medieval art and popular
theology accepted them as an infallible guide to celestial beings and
ranks. Their general purpose was to combine Neo- platonism with
Christian cosmology. God, though incomprehensibly transcend- ent, is
nevertheless immanent in all things as their source and life. Between
God and man intervene three triads of supernatural beings: Seraphim,
Cherubim, and Thrones; Dominations, Virtues, and Powers; Principalities,
Archangels, and Angels. (The reader will recall how Dante ranged these
nine groups around the throne of God, and how Milton wove some of their
names into a sonorous line.) Creation, in these works, is by emanation:
all things flow from God through these mediating angelic ranks; and
then, by a reverse process, these nine orders of the celestial hierarchy
lead men and all creation back to God.</p>
<p>hi. literature: 364-565</p>
<p>In 425 Theodosius II, or his regents, reorganized higher education in
Constanti- nople, and formally established a university of thirty-one
teachers: one for philos- ophy, two for law, twenty- eight for Latin and
Greek “grammar” and “rhetoric.” TTiese last included the study of the
two literatures; and the large number of teachers assigned to them
suggests a lively interest in letters. One such professor, Priscian,
composed, about 526, an immense Grammar of Latin and Greek, which became
one of the most famous textbooks of the Middle Ages. The Eastern Church
seems to have raised no objections at this time to the copying of the
pagan classics; 29 though a few saints protested, the School of
Constantinople transmitted faithfully, to the end of the Byzantine
Empire, the masterpieces of antiquity. And, despite the rising cost of
parchmeiit, the flow of books was still abundant. About 450 Musaeus, of
unknown provenance, composed his famous poem, Hero and Leander — how
Leander anticipated Byron by swimming the Hellespont to reach his
beloved Hero, how he died in the attempt, and how Hero, seeing him flung
up dead at the foot of her tower,</p>
<p>from the sheer crag plunged in hurtling headlong fall</p>
<p>To find with her dead love a death among the waves. 30</p>
<p>It was the Christian gentlemen of the Byzantine court who composed,
for the final installment of the Greek Anthology , graceful love poems
in the ancient moods and modes, and in terms of the pagan gods. Here,
from Agathias ( c . 550), is a song that may have helped Ben Jonson to a
masterpiece:</p>
<p>I love not wine; yet if thou’lt make</p>
<p>A sad man merry, sip first sup,</p>
<p>And when thou givest I’ll take the cup.</p>
<p>If thy lips touch it, for thy sake</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>No more may I be stiff and staid</p>
<p>And the luscious jug evade.</p>
<p>The cup conveys thy kiss to me,</p>
<p>And tells the joy it had of thee. 31</p>
<p>The most important literary work of this age was done by the
historians. Eunapius of Sardis composed a lost Universal History of the
period from 270 to 400, making Justinian his hero, and twenty-three
gossipy biographies of the later Sophists and Neoplatonists. Socrates,
an orthodox Christian of Constantinople, wrote a History of the Church
from 309 to 439; it is fairly accurate and generally fair, as we have
seen in the case of Hypatia; but this Socrates fills his narrative with
superstitions, legends, and miracles, and talks so frequently of himself
as if he found it hard to distinguish between himself and the cosmos. He
ends with a novel plea for peace among the sects: if peace comes, he
thinks, historians will have nothing to write about, and that miserable
tribe of tragedy-mongers will cease. 32 Mostly copied from Socrates is
the Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen, a convert from Palestine, and,
like his model, a lawyer at the capital; apparently a legal training was
no handicap to superstition. Zosimus of Constantinople com- posed, about
475, a History of the Roman Empire ; he was a pagan, but did not yield
to his Christian rivals in credulity and nonsense. Toward 525 Dionysius
Exiguus — Dennis the Short — suggested a new method of dating events,
from the supposed year of Christ’s birt h. The proposal was not accepted
by the Latin Church till the tenth century; and the Byzantines continued
to the end to number their years from the creation of the world. It is
discouraging to note how many things were known to the youth of our
civilization, which are unknown to us today.</p>
<p>The one great historian of the period was Procopius. Born in
Palestinian Caesarea (490), he studied law, came to Constantinople, and
was appointed secretary and legal adviser to Belisarius. He accompanied
the general on the Syrian, African, and Italian campaigns, and returned
with him to the capital. In 550 he published his Books of the Wars.
Knowing at first hand the merits of the general and the parsimony of the
ruler, he made Belisarius a brilliant hero, and left Justinian in the
shade. The book was received with applause by the public, with silence
by the Emperor. Procopius now composed his Anecdota, or Secret History ;
but he kept it so successfully from publication or circulation that in
554 he was commissioned by Justinian to write an ac- count of the
buildings erected during the reign. Procopius issued De Aedi- ficiis in
560, and so loaded it with praise for the Emperor that Justinian might
well have suspected it of insincerity or irony. The Secret History was
not given to the world until after Justinian — and perhaps Procopius —
had died. It is a fascinating book, like any denunciation of our
neighbors; but there is something unpleasant in literary attacks upon
persons who can no longer speak in their own defense. An historian who
strains his pen to prove a thesis may be trusted to distort the
truth.</p>

<li>The Passage from Paganism</li>
</ol>
<p>The pre-eminent achievements of Byzantine civilization were govern-
mental administration and decorative art: a state that survived eleven
centuries, a St. Sophia that stands today.</p>
<p>By Justinian’s time pagan art was finished, and half of its works had
been mutilated or destroyed. Barbarian ravages, imperial robbery, and
pious de- struction had began a process of ruination and neglect that
continued till Petrarch in the fourteenth century pled, so to speak, for
the lives of the sur- vivors. A factor in the devastation was the
popular belief that the pagan gods were demons, and that the temples
were their resorts; in any case, it was felt, the material could be put
to better use in Christian churches or domestic walls. Pagans themselves
often joined in the spoliation. Several Christian em- perors, notably
Honorius and Theodosius II, did their best to protect the old structures
, 34 and enlightened clergymen preserved the Parthenon, the temple of
Theseus, the Pantheon, and other structures by rededicating them as
Christian shrines.</p>
<p>Christianity at first suspected art as a support of paganism,
idolatry, and immorality; these nude statues hardly comported with
esteem for virginity and celibacy. When the body seemed an instrument of
Satan, and the monk replaced the athlete as ideal, the study of anatomy
disappeared from art, leav- ing a sculpture and painting of gloomy faces
and shapeless drapery. But when Christianity had triumphed, and great
basilicas were needed to house</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION 127</p>
<p>its swelling congregations, the local and national traditions of art
reasserted themselves, and architecture lifted itself out of the ruins.
Moreover, these spacious edifices cried out for decoration; the
worshipers needed statues of Christ and Mary to help the imagination,
and pictures to tell to the simple letterless the story of their
crucified God. Sculpture, mosaic, and painting were reborn.</p>
<p>In Rome the new art differed little from the old. Strength of
construction, simplicity of form, columnar basilican styles, were
carried down from pa- ganism to Christianity. Near Ne ro’s Circus on the
Vatican hill Constantine’s architects had designed the first
St. Peter’s, with an awesome length of 380 feet and breadth of 212; for
twelve centuries this remained the pontifical shrine of Latin
Christendom, until Bramante tore it down to raise upon its site the
still vaster St. Peter’s of today. The church that Constantine built

<p>From that time to our own the basilican plan has been a favorite
design for Christian churches; its modest cost, its majestic simplicity,
its structural logic and sturdy strength have recommended it in every
generation. But it did not lend itself readily to variation and
development. European builders began to look about them for new ideas,
and found them in the East — even at Spalato, the Adriatic outpost of
the Orient. There on the Dalmatian coast Diocletian, at the opening of
the fourth century, had given his artists free play to experiment in
raising a palace for his retirement; and they accom- plished a
revolution in European architecture. Arches were there sprung directly
from column capitals, with no intervening entablature; so at one stroke
were prepared the Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic styles. And instead
of figured friezes came, in this palace, a strange decoration of zigzag
lines, offensive to the classic eye, but long familiar to the Orient.
Spalato was the first sign that Europe was to be conquered not only by
an Oriental re- ligion, but, at least in the Byzantine world, by
Oriental art.</p>

<li>The Byzantine Artist</li>
</ol>
<p>Whence came to Constantinople that uniquely colorful, somberly bril-
liant art known as Byzantine? It is a question over which archaeologists
have fought with almost the ferocity of Christian soldiers; and by and
large the victory has gone to the East. As Syria and Asia Minor grew
stronger with industry, and Rome weaker with invasion, the Hellenistic
tide that had rushed in with Alexander ebbed back from Asia to Europe.
From Sasanian Persia, from Nestorian Syria, from Coptic Egypt, Eastern
art influences poured into Byzantium and reached to Italy, even to Gaul;
and the Greek art of naturalistic representation gave place to an
Oriental art of symbolic deco- ration. The East preferred color to line,
the vault and dome to the timbered roof, rich ornament to stem
simplicity, gorgeous silks to shapeless togas. Just as Diocletian and
Constantine had adopted the forms of Persian monarchy, so the art of
Constantinople looked less and less to the now barbarized West,
increasingly to Asia Minor, Armenia, Persia, Syria, and Egypt. Perhaps
the victory of Persian arms under Shapur II and Khosru Anushirvan
quickened the westward march of Eastern motives and forms. Edessa and
Nisibis were in this period flourishing centers of a Mesopotamian
culture that mingled Iranian, Armenian, Cappadocian, and Syrian elements
, 35 and transmitted them, through merchants, monks and artisans, to
Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus, Constantinople, at last to Ravenna and
Rome. The old classic orders — Doric, Ionian, Corinthian — became almost
meaningless in an architectural world of arches, vaults, pendentives,
and domes.</p>
<p>Byzantine art, so generated, dedicated itself to expounding the
doctrines of Christianity, and displaying the glory of the state. It
recounted on vest- ments and tapestries, in mosaics and murals, the life
of Christ, the sorrows of Mary, the career of the apostle or martyr
whose bones were enshrined in the church. Or it entered the court,
decorated the palace of the sovereign, cov- ered his official robes with
symbolic emblems or historical designs, dazzled his subjects with
flamboyant pageantry, and ended by representing Christ and Mary as an
emperor and a queen. The Byzantine artist had small choice of patron,
and therefore of subject or style; monarch or patriarch told him what to
do, and how. He worked in a group, and seldom left an individual name to
history. He achieved miracles of brilliance, he exalted and humbled the
people with the splendor of his creations; but his art paid in
formalism, narrowness, and stagnation for serving an absolute monarch
and a changeless creed.</p>
<p>He commanded abundant materials: marble quarries in the Proconnesus,
Attica, Italy; spoliable columns and capitals wherever a pagan temple
sur- vived; and bricks almost growing in the sun-dried earth. Usually he
worked with mortared brick; it lent itself well to the curved forms
imposed upon</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION I29</p>
<p>him by Oriental styles. Often he contented himself with the cruciform
plan — a basilica crossed with a transept and prolonged to an apse;
sometimes he broke the basilica into an octagon, as in Sts. Sergius and
Bacchus’ at Con - stant inople, or in San Vitale’s at Ravenna. But his
distinctive skill, in which he surpassed all artists before him or
since, lay in raising a circular dome over a polygonal frame. His
favorite means to this end was the pendentive: i.e., he built an arch or
semicircle of bricks over each side of the polygon, raised a spherical
triangle of bricks upward and inward between each semicircle, and laid a
dome upon the resultant circular ring. The spherical triangles were the
pendentives, “hanging” from the rim o f the dome to the top of the poly-
gon. In architectural effect the circle was squared. Thereafter the
basilican style almost disappeared from the East.</p>
<p>Within the edifice the Byzantine builder lavished all the skills of a
dozen arts. He rarely used statuary; he sought not so much to represent
figures of men and women as to create an abstract beauty of symbolic
form. Even so the Byzantine sculptors were artisans of ability,
patience, and resource. They carved the “Theodosian” capital by
combining the “ears” of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian
order; and to make profusion more confounded, they cut into this
composite capital a very jungle of animals and plants. Since the result
was not too well adapted to sustain a wall or an arch, they inserted
between these and the capital an impost or “pulvino,” square and broad
at the top, round and narrower at the base; and then, in the course of
time, they carved this too with flowers. Here again, as in the domed
square, Persia con- quered Greece. — But further, painters were assigned
to adorn the walls with edifying or terrifying pictures; mosaicists laid
their cubes of brightly colored stone or glass, in backgrounds of blue
or gold, upon the floors or walls, or over the altar, or in the
spandrels of the arches, or wherever an empty surface challenged the
Oriental eye. Jewelers set gems into vestments, altars, col- umns,
walls; metalworkers inserted gold or silver plates; woodworkers carved
the pulpit or chancel rails; weavers hung tapestries, laid rugs, and
covered altar and pulpit with embroidery and silk. Never before had an
art been so rich in color, so subtle in symbolism, so exuberant in
decoration, So well adapted to quiet the intellect and stir the
soul.</p>

<p>Not till Justinian did the Greek, Roman, Oriental, and Christian
factors complete their fusion into Byzantine art. The Nika revolt gave
him, like an- other Nero, an opportunity to rebuild his capital. In the
ecstasy of a mo- ment’s freedom the mob had burned do wn the Senate
House, the Baths of Zeuxippus, the porticoes of the Augusteum, a wing of
the imperial palace, and St. Sophia, cathedral of the patriarch.
Justinian might have rebuilt these</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>on their old plans, and within a year or two; instead he resolved to
spend more time, money, and men, make his capital more beautiful than
Rome, and raise a church that would outshine all other edifices on the
earth. He began now one of the most ambitious building programs in
history: fortresses, pal- aces, monasteries, churches, porticoes, and
gates rose throughout the Empire. In Constantinople he rebuilt the
Senate House in white marble, and the Baths of Zeuxippus in polychrome
marble; raised a marble portico and promenade in the Augusteum; and
brought fresh water to the city in a new aqueduct that rivaled Italy’s
best. He made his own palace the acme of splendor and luxury: its floors
and walls were of marble; its ceilings recounted in mosaic brilliance
the triumphs o f his reign, and showed the senators “in festal mood,
bestowing upon the Emperor honors almost divine.” 86 And across the Bos
- porus, near Chalcedon, he built, as a summer residence for Theodora
and her court, the palatial villa of Herion, equipped with its own
harbor, forum, church, and baths.</p>
<p>Forty days after the Nika revolt had subsided, he began a new
St. Sophia- dedicated not to any saint of that name, but to the Hagia
Sophia , the Holy Wisdom, or Creative Logos, of God Himself. From
Tralles in Asia Minor, and from Ionian Miletus, he summoned Anthemius
and Isidore, the most famous of living architects, to plan and
superintend the work. Abandoning the traditional basilican form, they
conceived a design whose center would be a spacious dome resting not on
walls but on massive piers, and buttressed by a half dome at either end.
Ten thousand workmen were engaged, 3 20,000 pounds of gold (34,000,000)
were spent, on the enterprise, quite empty- ing the treasury. Provincial
governors were directed to send to the new shrine the finest relics of
ancient monuments; marbles of a dozen kinds and tints were imported from
a dozen areas; gold, silver, ivory, and precious stones were poured into
the decoration. Justinian himself shared busily in the design and the
construction, and took no small part (his scornful adulator tells us) in
solving technical problems. Dressed in white linen, with a staff in his
hand and a kerchief on his head, he haunted the operation day after day,
encouraging the workers to complete their tasks competently and on time.
In five years and ten months the edifice was complete; and on December
26, 537, the Emperor and the Patriarch Menas led a solemn inaugural
procession to the resplendent cathedral. Justinian walked alone to the
pulpit, and lift- ing up his hands, cried out: “Glory be to God who has
thought me worthy to accomplish so great a work! O Solomon! I have
vanquished you!”</p>
<p>The ground plan was a Greek cross 250 by 225 feet; each end of the
cross was covered by a minor dome; the central dome rose over the square
( 100 by 100 feet) formed by the intersecting arms; the apex of the dome
was 180 feet above the ground; its diameter was 100 feet — 32 less than
the dome of the Pantheon in Rome. The latter had been poured in concrete
in one solid piece; St. Sophia’s dome was made of brick in thirty
converging panels— a</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION 1 3 1</p>
<p>much weaker construction.* The distinction of this dome was not in
size but in support: it rested not on a circular structure, as in the
Pantheon, but on pendentives and arches that mediated between the
circular rim and the square base; never has this architectural problem
been more satisfactorily solved. Procopius described the dome as “a work
admirabl e and terrify- ing . . . seeming not to rest on the masonry
below it, but to be suspended by a chain of gold from the height of the
sky.” 37</p>
<p>The interior was a panorama of luminous decoration. Marble of many
colors — white, green, red, yellow, purple, gold — made the pavement,
walls, and two-storied colonnades look like a field of flowers. Delicate
stone carv- ings covered capitals, arches, spandrels, moldings, and
cornices with classic leaves of acanthus and vine. Mosaics of
unprecedented scope and splendor looked down from walls and vaults.
Forty silver chandeliers, hanging from the rim of the dome, helped as
many windows to illuminate the church. The sense of spaciousness left by
the long nave and aisles, and by the pillarless space under the central
dome; the metal lacework of the silver railing before the apse, and of
the iron railing in the upper gallery; the pulpit inset with ivory,
silver, and precious stones; the solid silver throne of the patriarch;
the silk-and-gold curtain that rose over the altar with figures of the
Emperor and the Empress receiving the benedictions of Christ and Mary;
the golden altar itself, of rare marbles, and bearing sacred vessels of
silver and gold: this lavish ornamentation might have warranted
Justinian in anticipating the boast of the Mogul shahs — that they built
like giants and finished like jewelers.</p>
<p>St. Sophia was at once the inauguration and the culmination of the
Byzan- tine style. Men everywhere spoke of it as “the Great Church,” and
even the sk eptical Procopius wrote of it with awe. “When one enters
this building to pray, he feels that.it is not the work of human power.
. . . The soul, lifting itself to the sky, realizes that here God is
close by, and that He takes delight in this, His chosen home.” t 38</p>

</ol>
<p>St. Sophia was Justinian’s supreme achievement, more lasting than his
conquests or his laws. But Procopius describes twenty-four other
churches built or rebuilt by him in the capital, and remarks: “I f you
should see one of them by itself you would suppose that the Emperor had
built this work only, and had spent the whole time of his reign on this
one alone.” 39 Throughout the Empire this fury of</p>

life.</li>

<p>t The Turks, after capturing Constantinople in 1453, covered the
mosaics of St. Sophia with plaster, abhorring the “graven images” as
idolatry; but in recent years the Turkish government has permitted a
corps of workers from the Byzantine Institute of Boston, Massachusetts,
to uncover these unsurpassed examples of the mosaic art. The Turkish
conquerors almost atoned by adding four graceful minarets, completely
harmonious with the domical design.</p>

<p>construction raged till Justinian ’s death; and that sixth century
which marked the beginning of the Dark Ages in the West was in the East
one of the richest epochs in architectural history. In Ephesus, Antioch,
Gaza, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Salonika, Ravenna, Rome, and from Crimean
Kerch to African Sfax, a thousand churches celebrated the triumph both
of Christianity over paganism and of the Oriental-Byzantine over the
Greco-Roman style. External columns, architraves, pediments,- and
friezes made way for the vault, the pendentive, and the dome. Syria had
a veritable renaissance in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries; her
schools at Antioch, Berytus (Beirut), Edessa, and Nisibis poured forth
orators, lawyers, historians, and heretics; her artisans excelled in
mosaics, textiles, and all decorative arts; her architects raised a
hundred churches; her sculptors adorned them with lavish reliefs.</p>
<p>Alexandria was the one city in the Empire that never ceased to
prosper. Her founder had chosen for her a site that almost forced the
Mediterranean world to use her ports and enhance her trade. None of her
ancient or early medieval architecture has survived; but the scattered
relics of her work in metal, ivory, wood, and portraiture suggest a
people as rich in art as in sensuality and bigotry. Coptic architecture,
which had begun with the Roman basilica, became under Justinian
predominantly Oriental.</p>
<p>The architectural splendor of Ravenna began soon after Honorius made
it the seat of the Western Empire in 404. The city prospered in the long
regency of Galla Placidia; and the close relations maintained with
Constantinople brought Eastern artists and styles to mingle with Italian
architects and forms. The typical Oriental plan of a dome placed with
pendentives over the transept of a cruciform base appeared there as
early as 450 in the Mausoleum where Placidia at last found tranquillity;
within it one may still see the famous mosaic of Christ as the Good
Shepherd. In 458 Bishop Neon added to the domed baptistery of the
Basilica Ursiana a series of mosaics that included remarkably individual
portraits of the Apostles. About 500 Theodoric built for his Arian
bishop a cathedral named after St. Apollinaris, the reputed founder of
the Christian community in Ra- venna; here, in world-renowned mosaics,
the white-robed saints bear themselves with a stiff solemnity that
already suggests the Byzantine style.</p>
<p>The conquest of Ravenna by Belisarius advanced the victory of
Byzantine art in Italy. The church of San Vitale was completed (547)
under Justinian and Theodora, who financed its decoration, and lent
their unseductive features to its adornment. There is every indication
that these mosaics are realistic portraits; and emperor and empress must
be credited with courage in permitting their likenesses to be
transmitted to posterity. The attitudes of these rulers, ecclesiastics,
and eunuchs are hard and angular; their stiff frontality is a reversion
to preclassical forms; the robes of the women are a mosaic triumph, but
we miss here the happy grace of the Parthenon procession, or the Ara
pads of Augustus, or the nobility and tenderness of the figures on the
portals of Chartres or Reims.</p>
<p>Two years after dedicating San Vitale the Bishop of Ravenna
consecrated Sant’ Apollinare in Classe— a second church for the city’s
patron saint, placed in the maritime suburb that had once been the
Adriatic base of the Roman fleet ( classis ). Here is the old Roman
basilican plan; but on the composite capitals a</p>

<p>133</p>
<p>Byzantine touch appears in the acanthus leaves unclassically curled
and twisted, as if blown by some Eastern wind. The long rows of perfect
columns, the colorful (seventh-century) mosaics in the archivolts and
spandrels of the colonnades, the lovely stucco plaques in the choir, the
cross of gems on a bed of mosaic stars in the apse, make this one of the
outstanding shrines of a peninsula that is almost a gallery of art.</p>
<p>5 . The Byzantine Arts</p>
<p>Architecture was the masterpiece of the Byzantine artist, but about
it or within it were a dozen other arts in which he achieved some
memorable ex- cellence. He did not care for sculpture in the round; the
mood of the age preferred color to line; yet Procopius lauded the
sculptors of his time — pre- sumably the carvers of reliefs — as the
equals of Pheidias and Praxiteles; and some stone sarcophagi of the
fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries have human figures chiseled with
almost Hellenic grace, confused with an Asiatic plethora of ornament.
The carving of ivory was a favorite art among the Byzantines; they used
it for diptychs, triptychs, book covers, caskets, per- fume boxes,
statuettes, inlays, and in a hundred decorative ways; in this craft
Hellenistic techniques survived unimpaired, and merely turned gods and
heroes into Christ and the saints. The ivory chair of Bishop Maximian in
the Basilica Ursiana at Ravenna ( c . 550) is a major achievement in a
minor art.</p>
<p>While the Far East, in the sixth century, was experimenting with
oil</p>
<p>colors, 40 Byzantine painting adhered to traditional Greek methods:
encaustic — colors burnt into panels of wood, canvas, or linen; fresco —
colors mixed with lime and applied to wet plaster surfaces; and tempera
— colors mixed with size or gum or glue and white of egg, and applied to
panels or to plaster already dry. The Byzantine painter knew how to
represent distance and depth, but usually shirked the difficulties of
perspective by filling in the background with buildings and screens.
Portraits were numerous, but few have survived. Church walls were
decorated with murals; the fragments that remain show a rough realism,
unshapely hands, stunted figures, sallow faces, and incredible
coiffures.</p>
<p>The Byzantine artist excelled and reveled in the minute; his extant
master- pieces of painting are not murals or panels, but the miniatures
with which he literally “illuminated”— made bright with color — the
publications of his age.* Books, being costly, were adorned like other
precious objects. The miniatur- ist first sketched his design upon
papyrus, parchment, or vellum with a fine brush or pen; laid down a
background usually in gold or blue; filled in his colors, and decorated
background and borders with graceful and delicate forms. At first he had
merely elaborated the initial letter of a chapter or a page; sometimes
he essayed a portrait of the author; then he illustrated the</p>

<p>text with pictures; finally, as his art improved, he almost forgot
the text, and spread himself out in luxurious ornament, taking a
geometrical or floral mo- tive, or a religious symbol, and repeating it
in a maze of variations, until all the page was a glory of color and
line, and the text seemed like an intrusion from a coarser world.</p>
<p>The illumination of manuscripts had been practiced in Pharaonic and
Ptolemaic Egypt, and had passed thence to Hellenistic Greece and Rome.
The Vatican treasures an Aeneid, the Ambrosian Library at Milan an
Iliad, both ascribed to the fourth century, and completely classic in
ornament. The transition from pagan to Christian miniatures appears in
the Topographia Christiana of Cosmas Indicopleustes (c. 547), who earned
his sobriquet by sailing to India, and his fame by trying to prove that
the earth is flat. The oldest extant religious miniature is a
fifth-century Genesis, now in the Li- brary of Vienna; the text is
written in gold and silver letters on twenty-four leaves of purple
vellum; the forty-eight miniatures, in white, green, violet, red, and
black, picture the story of man from Adam’s fall to Jacob’s death. Quite
as beautiful are the Joshua Rotulus (Little Roll of the Book of Joshua)
in the Vatican, and the Book of the Gospels illuminated by the monk
Rabula in Mesopotamia in 586. From Mesopotamia and Syria came the
figures and symbols that dominated the iconography, or picture-writing,
of the Byzan- tine world; repeated in a thousand forms in the minor
arts, they became stereotyped and conventional, and shared in producing
the deadly immuta- bility of Byzantine art.</p>
<p>Loving brilliance and permanence, the Byzantine painter made mosaic
his favorite medium. For floors he chose tesserae of colored marble, as
Egyp- tians, Greeks, and Romans had done; for other surfaces he used
cubes of glass or enamel in every shade, cut in various sizes, but
usually an eighth of an inch square. Precious stones were sometimes
mingled with the cubes. Mosaic was often employed in making portable
pictures or icons, to be set up in churches or homes, or carried on
travels as aids to devotion and safety; preferably, however, the
mosaicist sought the larger scope of church or palace walls. In his
studio, upon a canvas bearing a colored design, he tentatively laid his
cubes; and here his art was strained to produce immediately under his
hand the precise gradation and melting of colors to be felt by other
eyes from greater distances. Meanwhile a coat of heavy cement, and then
a coat of fine cement, were laid upon the surface to be covered; into
this matrix the mo- saicist, following his canvas model, pressed his
cubes, usually with cut edges to the front to catch the light. Curved
surfaces like domes, and the concbes or shell-like half domes of apses,
were favored, since they would catch at dif- ferent times and angles a
variety of softened and shaded light. From this painstaking art Gothic
would derive part of its inspiration for stained glass.</p>
<p>Such glass is mentioned in fifth-century texts, but no example
remains, and apparently the stain was external, not fused. 41
Glass-cutting and blowing</p>

<p>were now a thousand years old, and Syria, their earliest known home,
was still a center of the crafts. The art of engraving precious metals
or stones had deteriorated since Aurelius; Byzantine gems, coins, and
seals are of relatively poor design and workmanship. Jewelers
nevertheless sold their products to nearly every class, for ornament was
the soul of Byzantium. Goldsmith and silversmith studios were numerous
in the capital; gold pyxes, chalices, and reliquaries adorned many
altars; and silver plate oppressed the tables of moneyed homes.</p>
<p>Every house, almost every person, carried some textile finery. Egypt
led the way here with its delicate, many-colored, figured fabrics —
garments, cur- tains, hangings, and coverings; the Copts were the
masters in these fields. Certain Egyptian tapestries of this period are
almost identical in technique with the Gobelins . 42 Byzantine weavers
made silk brocades, embroideries, even embroidered shrouds — linens
realistically painted with the features of the dead. In Constantinople a
man was known by the garments he wore; each class prized and defended
some distinctive refinement of dress; and a Byzan- tine assemblage
doubtless shone like a peacock’s tail.</p>
<p>Among all classes music was popular. It played a rising role in the
liturgy of the Church, and helped to fuse emotion into belief. In the
fourth century Alypius wrote a Musical Introduction , whose extant
portions are our chief guide to the musical notation of the Greeks. This
representation of notes by letters was replaced, in that century, by
abstract signs, neumes Ambrose ap- parently introduced these to Milan,
Hilary to Gaul, Jerome to Rome. About the end of the fifth century
Romanus, a Greek monk, composed the words and music of hymns that still
form part of the Greek liturgy, and have never been equaled in depth of
feeling and power of expression. Boethius wrote an essay De Musica,
summarizing the theories of Pythagoras, Aristoxenus, and Ptolemy; this
little treatise was used as a text in music at Oxford and Cambridge
until our times . 43</p>
<p>One must be an Oriental to understand an Oriental art. To a Western
mind the essence of Byzantinism means that the East had become supreme
in the heart and head of Greece: in the autocratic government, the
hierarchi- cal stability of classes, the stagnation of science and
philosophy, the state- dominated Church, the religion-dominated people,
the gorgeous vestments and stately ceremonies, the sonorous and scenic
ritual, the hypnotic chant of repetitious music, the overwhelming of the
senses with brilliance and color, the conquest of naturalism by
imagination, the submergence of representa- tive under decorative art.
The ancient Greek spirit would have found this alien and unbearable, but
Greece herself was now part of the Orient. An Asiatic lassitude fell
upon the Greek world precisely when it was to be chal- lenged in its
very life by the renewed vitality of Persia and the incredible energy of
Islam.</p>
