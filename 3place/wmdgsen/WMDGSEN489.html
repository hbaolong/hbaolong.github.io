<p>XXThe Faiths at War</p>
<p>1525-60</p>
<p>I. THE PROTESTANT ADVANCE: 1 525-3 O</p>
<p>W HAT combination of forces and circumstances enabled nascent</p>
<p>Protestantism to survive the hostility of both papacy and Empire?</p>
<p>Mystical piety, Biblical studies, religious reform, intellectual
development, Luther’s audacity, were not enough; they might have been
diverted or con - trolled. Probably the economic factors were decisive:
the desire to keep German wealth in Germany, to free Germany from papal
or Italian domi- nation, to transfer ecclesiastical property to secular
uses, to repel Imperial encroachments upon the territorial, judicial,
and financial authority of the German princes, cities, and states. Add
certain political conditions that per- ?nitted the Protestant success.
The Ottoman Empire, after conquering Con- stantinople and Egypt, was
expanding dangerously in the Balkans and Africa, absorbing half of
Hungary, besieging Vienna, and threatening to close the Mediterranean to
Christian trade; Charles V and Archduke Ferdi- nand required a united
Germany and Austria — Protestant as well as Catholic money and men — to
resist this Moslem avalanche. The Emperor was usually engrossed in the
affairs of Spain or Flanders or Italy, or in mortal conflict with
Francis I of France; he had no time or funds for civil war in Germany.
He agreed with his pensioner Erasmus that the Church badly needed
reform; he was intermittently at odds with Clement VII and Paul III,
even to allow- ing his army to sack Rome; only when Emperor and Pope
were friends could they effectually combat the religious revolution.</p>
<p>But by 1527 the Lutheran “heresy” had become orthodoxy in half of
Germany. The cities found Protestantism profitable; “they do not care in
the least about religion,” mourned Melanchthon; “they are only anxious
to get dominion into their hands, to be free from the control of the
bishops”; 1 for a slight alteration in their theological garb they
escaped from episcopal taxes and courts, and could appropriate pleasant
parcels of ecclesiastical property. 2 Yet an honest desire for a simpler
and sincerer religion seems to have moved many citizens. At Magdeburg
the members of St. Ulrich’s parish met in the churchyard and chose eight
men who were to select the preacher and manage the affairs of the church
(1524); soon all churches in</p>

<p>THE FAITHS AT WAR</p>
<p>439</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>the city were administering the Lord’s S upper in the Lutheran mode.
Augs- burg was so fervently Protestant that when Campeggio came there as
papal legate the populace dubbed him Antichrist (1524). Most of
Strasbourg ac- cepted the new theology from Wolfgang Fabricius Capito
(1523), and Martin Bucer, who succeeded him there, also converted Ulm.
In Nuremberg great business leaders like Lazarus Spengler and Hieronymus
Baumgart- ner won the city council to the Lutheran creed (1526); the
Sebaldus- kirche and the Lorenzkirche transformed their ritual
accordingly, while keeping their Catholic art. In Brunswick the writings
of Luther were -widely circulated; his hymns were publicly sung; his
version of the New Testament was so earnestly studied that when a priest
misquoted it he was corrected by the congregation; finally the city
council ordered all clergymen to preach only what could be found in the
Scriptures, to baptize in German, and to serve the sacrament in both
forms (1528). By 1530 the new faith had won Hamburg, Bremen, Rostock,
Liibeck, Stralsund, Danzig, Dorpat, Riga, Reval, and almost all the
Imperial cities of Swabia. Iconoclastic riots broke out in Augsburg,
Hamburg, Brunswick, Stralsund. Probably some of this violence was a
reaction against the ecclesiastical use of statues and paintings to
inculcate ridiculous and lucrative legends.</p>
<p>The princes, gladly adopting Roman law — which made the secular ruler
omnipotent as delegate of the “sovereign people”— saw in Protestantism a
religion that not only exalted the state but obeyed it; now they could
be spiritual as well as temporal lords, and all the wealth of the Church
could be theirs to administer or enjoy. John the Steadfast, who
succeeded Frederick the Wise as Elector of Saxony (1525), definitely
accepted the Lutheran faith, which Frederick had never done; and when
John died (1532) his son John Frederick kept Electoral Saxony firmly
Protestant. Philip the Mag- nanimous, Landgrave of Hesse, formed with
John the League of Gotha and Torgau (1526) to protect and extend
Lutheranism. Other princes fell in line: Ernest of Liineburg, Otto and
Francis of Brunswick-Liineburg, Henry of Mecklenburg, Ulrich of
Wiirttemberg. Albert of Prussia, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights,
following Luther’s advice, abandoned his monastic vows, married,
secularized the lands of his order, and made himself Duke of Prussia
(1525). Luther saw himself, apparently by the mere force of his
personality and eloquence, winning half of Germany.</p>
<p>Since many monks and nuns now left their convents, and the public
seemed unwilling to support the remainder, the Lutheran princes
suppressed all monasteries in their territory except a few whose inmates
had embraced the Protestant faith. The princes agieed to share the
confiscated properties and revenues with the nobles, the cities, and
some universities, but this pledge was very laxly redeemed. Luther
inveighed against the application of ecclesi- astical wealth to any but
religious or educational purposes, and condemned</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>44O</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXthe precipitate seizure of church buildings and lands by the
nobility. A modest part of the spoils was yielded to schools and poor
relief; the princes and nobles kept the rest. “Under cover of the
Gospel,” wrote Melanchthon (1530), “the princes were only intent on the
plunder of the churches.” 8</p>
<p>For good or evil, for spiritual or material ends, the great
transformation progressed. Whole provinces — East Friesland, Silesia,
Schleswig, Holstein — went over almost unanimously to Protestantism;
nothing could better show how moribund Catholicism had there become.
Where priests survived, they continued their support of concubines, 4
and clamored for permission to marry legally as the Lutheran clergy were
doing.® Archduke Ferdinand reported to the Pope that the desire for
marriage was almost universal among the Catholic secular clergy, that
out of a hundred pastors scarcely one was not openly or secretly
married; and Catholic princes pleaded with the papacy that the abolition
of celibacy had become a moral necessity. 6 A loyal Catholic complained
( 1524) that the bishops, with revolution on their door- steps, went on
with their Lucullan feasts; 7 and a Catholic historian, speaking of
Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz, describes “the luxuriously furnished
apartments which this unholy prince of the Church used for secret inter-
course with his mistress.” 8 “Everybody,” says the same historian, “had
be - come so hostile to priests that these were mocked and annoyed
wherever they went.” 9 “The people everywhere,” wrote Erasmus (January
31, 1 530) , “are for the new doctrines.” 10 This was true, however,
only in north - ern Germany; and even there Duke George of Saxony and
Elector Joachim of Brandenburg were resolutely Catholic. Southern and
western Germany — which had been part of the ancient Roman Empire, and
had received some Latin culture — remained for the most part loyal to
the Church; the gemutlich South preferred the gaily colorful and
sexually lenient ways of Catholicism to the predestinarian stoicism of
the North. The powerful elector-arch- bishops of Mainz, Trier, and (till
1543) Cologne kept their regions predom- inantly Catholic; and Pope
Adrian VI saved Bavaria by granting its dukes, for their secular uses, a
fifth of ecclesiastical income in their state. A similar grant of Church
revenues appeased Ferdinand in Austria.</p>
<p>Hungary entered vitally into the drama. The premature accession of
Louis II at the age of ten (1516), and his premature death, were
formative elements in the Hungarian tragedy. Even his birth was
premature; the medicos of his time barely saved the frail infant by
enclosing it in the warm carcasses of animals slaughtered to give it
heat. Louis grew into a handsome youth, kindly and generous, but given
to extravagance and festivities on meager resources amid a corrupt and
incompetent court. When Sultan Suleiman sent an ambassador to Buda the
nobles refused to receive him, dragged him around the country, cut off
his nose and ears, and tinned him back to his master. 11 The infuriated
Sultan invaded Hungary, and seized</p>
<p>THE FAITHS AT WAR</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>44I</p>
<p>two of its most vital strongholds — Szabacs and Belgrade (1521).
After long delays, and amid the treason or cowardice of his nobles,
Louis raised an army of 25,000 men, and marched out with mad heroism to
face 100,000 Turks on a field near Mohacs (August 30, 1526). The
Hungarians were slaughtered almost to a man, and Louis himself was
drowned in stumbling flight. Suleiman entered Buda in triumph; his army
sacked and burned the handsome capital, destroyed all its major
buildings except the royal palace, and gave to the flames most of
Matthias Corvinus’s precious library. The victorious host spread over
the eastern half of Hungary, burning and pil- laging, and Suleiman drove
100,000 Christian captives before him to Con- stantinople.</p>
<p>The surviving magnates divided into hostile factions. One group,
judging resistance impossible, chose John Zapolya as king, and
authorized him to sign a submissive peace; Suleiman allowed him to reign
in Buda as his vassal, but the eastern half of Hungary remained in
effect under Turkish domi- nation till 1686. Another faction united with
the nobles of Bohemia to give the crown of both Hungary and Bohemia to
Ferdinand, in the hope of securing the aid of the Holy Roman Empire and
the powerful Hapsburg family. When Suleiman returned to the attack
(1529), marching 135 miles from Buda along the Danube to the gates of
Vienna, Ferdinand successfully defended his capital. But during those
critical years Charles V had been forced to humor the Protestants lest
all Europe should fall to Islam. The westward advance of the Turks so
obviously protected Protestantism that Philip of Hesse rejoiced at
Turkish victories. When Suleiman, balked at Vienna, returned to
Constantinople, Catholics and Protestants were free to renew their
struggle for the soul of Germany.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE DIETS DISAGREE: I526-4I</li>
</ol>
<p>As internal liberty varies (other things equal) with external
security, Protestantism, during its safe period, indulged in the
sectarian fragmenta- tion that seemed inherent in the principles of
private judgment and the supremacy of conscience. Already in 1525 Luther
wrote: “There are nowa - days almost as many sects and cre eds as there
are heads.” 12 Melanchthon was kept grievously busy moderating his
master and finding ambiguous formulas for reconciling contradictory
certitudes. Catholics pointed glee- fully to the mutually recriminating
Protestant factions, and predicted that freedom of interpretation and
belief would lead to religious anarchy, moral disintegration, and a
skepticism abominable to Protestants as well as Catho- lics. 13 In 1525
three artists were banished from Protestant Nuremberg for</p>
<p>442 THE REFORMATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXquestioning the divine authorship of the Bible, the Real Presence
in the Eucharist, and the divinity of Christ.</p>
<p>While Suleiman was preparing the campaign that cut Hungary in half, a
Diet of German princes, prelates, and burghers met at Speyer (June 1526)
to consider the demands of the Catholics that the Edict of Worms should
be enforced, and the counterproposal of the Protestants that religion be
left free until a general council under German auspices should
adjudicate the disputes. The Protestants prevailed, and the concluding
decree of this Diet ruled that — pending such a council — each German
state, in religion, “should so live, rule, and bear itself as it thought
it could answer to God and the Emperor”; that no one should be p unished
for past offenses against the Edict of Worms; and that the Word of God
should be preached by all parties, none interfering with the others. The
Protestants interpreted this “Recess of Speyer” * as sanctioning the
establishment of Lutheran churches, the religious autonomy of each
territorial prince, and the prohibition of the Mass in Lutheran areas.
The Catholics rejected these assumptions, but the Emperor, embroiled
with the Pope, accepted them for the time being; and Ferdinand was soon
too busy with affairs in Hungary to make any effectual resistance.</p>
<p>Having made his peace with Clement, Charles returned to the natural
conservatism of a king, and ordered the Diet of Speyer to reconvene on
February 1, 1529. Under the influence of the presiding Archduke and the
absent Emperor the new assembly repealed the “Recess” of 1526, and
passed a decree permitting Lutheran services — but requiring the
toleration of Cath- olic services — in Lutheran states, completely
forbidding Lutheran preach- ing or ritual in Catholic states, enforcing
the Edict of Worms, and outlawing Zwinglian and Anabaptist sects
everywhere. On April 25, 1529, the Luth- eran minority published a
“Protest” d eclaring that conscience forbade their acceptance of this
decree; they appealed to the Emperor for a general coun- cil; meanwhile
they would adhere to the original Recess of Speyer at what- ever cost.
The term Protestant was applied by the Catholics to the signers of this
Protest, and gradually came into use to designate the German rebels from
Rome.</p>
<p>Still needing German unity against the Turks, Charles called another
diet, which met at Augsburg (June 20, 1530) under his presidency. During
this conference he stayed with Anton Fugger, now head of the firm that
had made him emperor. According to an old story, the banker pleased the
ruler by lighting a fire with an Imperial certificate of indebtedness.
14 As the Fug- gers were financially allied with the popes, the gesture
may have moved</p>

<li>Recess is the accepted mistranslation of Abschied, which, like the
better rendering, deci - sion, meant a cutting off — a concluding decree

</ul>
<p>THE FAITHS A1 WAR</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>443</p>
<p>Charles a step nearer to the papacy. Luther did not attend, for he
was still under the Imperial ban, and might at any moment be arrested;
but he went to Coburg, on the Saxon border, and kept in touch, through
messengers, with the Protestant delegation. He compared the assembly to
a congregation of jackdaws that chattered and maneuvered before his
windows, and he com- plained that “each bishop brought as many devils”
or voters to the Diet “as there are fleas on a dog on St. John’s Day.”
16 It was apparently at this time that he composed the greatest of his
hymns — “Ein feste Burg ist wiser Gott” —“A mighty fortress is our
God.”</p>
<p>On June 24 Cardinal Campeggio appealed to the Diet for the utter sup-
pression of the Protestant sects. On the twenty-fifth Christian Bayer
read to the Emperor and a portion of the assembly the famous Augsburg
Confes- sion, which Melanchthon had prepared, and which, with some
modifica- tions, was to become the official creed of the Lutheran
churches. Partly because he feared a war of the combined Imperial and
papal forces against the divided Protestants, partly because he was by
temperament inclined to compromise and peace, Melanchthon gave the
statement (says a Catholic scholar) “a dignified, moderate, and pacific
tone,” 16 and strove to minimize the differences between the Catholic
and Lutheran views. He expatiated on the heresies that the Evangelicals
(as the Lutherans called themselves from their sole reliance on the
Gospels or the New Testament) and the Roman Catholics alike condemned;
he dissociated the Lutheran from the Zwinglian reform, and left the
latter to shift for itself. He softened the doctrines of predestination,
“consubstantiation,” and justification by faith; he spoke tem - perately
of the ecclesiastical abuses that Protestantism had abated; he de-
fended with courtesy the administration of the sacrament in both forms,
the abolition of monastic vows, the marriage of the clergy; and he
appealed to Cardinal Campeggio to accept this Confession in the
conciliatory spirit in which it had been composed. Luther regretted some
of the concessions, but gave the document his indispensable approval.
Zwingli sent his own Ratio fidei to the Emperor, frankly stating his
disbelief in the Real Presence. Stras- bourg, Constance, Lindau, and
Memmingen presented a separate Confession, the T etrapolitana, in which
Capito and Bucer struggled to bridge the gaps among the Lutheran,
Zwinglian, and Catholic creeds.</p>
<p>The extreme faction of the Catholics, led by Eck, retorted with a
Confu- tation so intransigeant that the assembly refused to submit it to
the Emperor until it had been twice toned down. So revised, it insisted
on transubstantia- tion, seven sacraments, the invocation of saints,
clerical celibacy, commun- ion in bread alone, and the Latin Mass.
Charles approved this Confutation, and declared that the Protestants
must accept it or face war. A milder party of Catholics entered into
negotiation with Melanchthon, and offered to permit communion in bread
and wine. Melanchthon in return agreed to</p>
<p>444 THE reformation (chap.xx</p>
<p>recognize auricular confession, fasts, episcopal jurisdiction, even,
with some provisos, the authority of the popes. But other Protestant
leaders refused to go so far; Luther protested that the restoration of
episcopal jurisdiction would subject the new ministers to the Roman
hierarchy, and would soon liquidate the Reformation. Seeing agreement
impossible, several Protestant princes left for their homes.</p>
<p>On November 19 the diminished Diet issued its final Recess or decree.
All phases of Protestantism were condemned; the Edict of Worms was to be
enforced; the Imperial Chamber of Justice (Reichskatmnergericht) was to
start legal actions against all appropriators of ecclesiastical
property; the Protestants were to have until April 15, 1531 to accept
the Confutation peaceabl y. Charles’s signature made this “Recess of
Augsburg” an Imperial decree. To the Emperor it must have seemed the
height of reasonableness to give the rebels six months to adjust
themselves to the will of the Diet. Within that period he offered them
immunity from the Edict of Worms. Thereafter, if other duties would
allow, he might have to submit the rival theologies to the supreme court
of war.</p>
<p>While the Diet was yet in session several states formed a Catholic
League for the defense and restoration of the traditional faith.
Interpreting this as a martial gesture, Protestant princes and cities
organized (March 1531) the Schmalkaldic League, which took its name from
its birthplace near Erfurt. When the period of grace ran out, Ferdinand,
now “King of the Romans,” proposed to Charles to begin war. But Charles
was not yet ready. Suleiman was planning another attack upon Vienna;
Suleiman’s confederate, Barba - rossa, was raiding Christian commerce in
the Mediterranean; and Suleiman’s ally, Francis of France, was waiting
to pounce upon Milan the moment Charles became involved in a German
civil war. In April 1531, instead of enforcing the Augsburg decree, he
suspended it, and asked for Protestant aid against the Turks. Luther and
the princes responded loyally; Lutherans and Catholics signed the Peace
of Nuremberg (July 23, 1532), pledging united aid to Ferdinand, and
mutual religious toleration until a general council should be convened.
So numerous an army of Protestant and Cath- olic Germans, of Spanish and
Italian Catholics, gathered under the Em- peror’s standard at Vienna
that Suleiman found the omens unfavorable and turned back to
Constantinople, while the Christian army, drunk with its bloodless
victory, pl undered Christian towns and homes, “spreading greater
disaster,” said eyewitness Thomas Cranmer of England, “than the Turks
themselves.” 17</p>
<p>The patriotism of the Protestants gave their movement new dignity and
impetus. When Aleander, again papal emissary, offered the Lutheran
leaders a hearing at a general council if they would promise submission
to the</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE FAITHS AT WAR 445</p>
<p>council’s final decisions, they rejected the proposal. A year later
(1534) Philip of Hesse, disregarding Luther’s condemnation of any
offensive policy, accepted French aid in restoring the Protestant Duke
Ulrich to power in Wiirttemberg. Ferdinand’s rule there was ended; the
churches were pillaged, the monasteries were closed, and their property
was taken by the state. 18 Circumstances again favored the Protestants:
Ferdinand was absorbed in the east, Charles in the west; the Anabaptists
were apparently consolidating a communistic revolution in Munster;
Jurgen Wullenwever’s radicals cap- tured Liibeck (1535); the Catholic
princes now needed Lutheran aid against internal revolt as much as
against the Ottomans. Moreover, Scandinavia and England had by this time
renounced Rome, and Catholic France was seeking the alliance of Lutheran
Germany against Charles V.</p>
<p>Elated with this growing strength, the Schmalkaldic League voted to
raise an army of 12,000 men. When the new pope, Paul III, asked on what
terms the League would accept a general council, it replied that it
would recognize only a council held independently of the pope, composed
of the secular as well as the ecclesiastical leaders of Germany, and
receiving the Protestants not as heretics but as equal participants. 19
It repudiated the Im- perial Chamber of Justic e, and notified the
Emperor’s vice -chancellor that it would not admit the right of
Catholics to retain Church property, or to carry on their worship, in
the territories of Protestant princes. 20 The Cath- olic states renewed
their League, and demanded of Charles full enforcement of the powers
given to the Reichskammergericht. He replied with gracious words, but
fear of Francis I at his back kept him at bay.</p>
<p>The Protestant tide continued to flow. Says a Catholic historian:</p>
<p>On the 9th of September, 1538, Aleander wrote to the Pope from</p>
<p>Linz that the religious condition of Germany was well-nigh
ruinous;</p>
<p>divine worship and the administration of the sacraments had for the
most part ceased; the secular princes, with the exception of Ferdi-</p>
<p>nand I, were either entirely Lutheran, or full of hatred of the
priest-</p>
<p>hood, and greedy of church property. The prelates lived just as</p>
<p>extravagantly as before. . . . The religious orders had dwindled down
to handfuls; the secular clergy were not much more numerous, and so
immoral and ignorant that the few Catholics shunned them. 21</p>
<p>When the Catholic Duke George of Albertine Saxony died he was suc-
ceeded by his brother Henry, a Lutheran; Henry in turn was succeeded by
Maurice, who was to be the military savior of Protestantism in Germany.
In 1539 Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg, set up in his capital at
Berlin a Protestant Church proudly independent of both Rome and
Wittenberg. In 1 542 the duchy of Cleves, the bishopric of Naum burg,
even Albrecht’s see of Halle, were added to the Protestant roster by
timely mixtures of</p>
<p>44&lt;S the reformation (chap.xx</p>
<p>politics and war; and in 1543 Count Hermann von Wied, Archbishop-
Elector of Cologne, shocked Rome by transforming himself into a
Lutheran. The Protestant leaders were so confident that in January 1540,
Luther, Melanchthon, and others issued a declaration to the effect that
peace could be had only through the renunciation, by the Emperor and the
Catholic clergy, of their “idolatry and error,” and by their adoption of
the “pure doctrine” of the Augsburg Confession. And the document
proceeded: “Even if the Pope were to concede to us our doctrines and
ceremonies, we</p>
<p>Charles almost agreed, for in April 1540, he took the religious
initiative from the Pope, and invited the Catholic and Protestant
leaders of Germany to meet in “Christian colloquy” to seek again a
peaceful settlement of their differences. “Unless the Pope intervenes
decisively,” wrote a papal nuncio, “the whole of Germany will fall a
prey to Protestantism.” At a preliminary conference in Worms a long
debate between Eck and Melanchthon resulted in the tentative acceptance,
by the previously intransigeant Catholic, of the mild positions
formulated in the Augsburg Confession. 23 Encouraged, Charles summoned
the two groups to Ratisbon (Regensburg) . There, under his leadership
(April 5-May 22, 1541), they made their closest approach to a
settlement. Paul III was disposed to peace, and his chief delegate,
Cardinal Gasparo Contarini, was a man of good will and high moral
character. The Emperor, harassed by threats from France and appeals from
Ferdinand for help against the returning Turks, was so anxious for an
agreement that many Catholic leaders suspected him of Protestant
leanings. The conference con- curred in permitting marriage of the
clergy and communion in both kinds; but no legerdemain could find a
formula at once affirming and denying the religious supremacy of the
popes, and transubstantiation in the Eucharist; and Contarini was not
amused by a Protestant query whether a mouse that nibbled at a fallen
consecrated Host was eating bread or God. 24 The confer- ence failed,
but Charles, hurrying off to war, gave an interim pledge to the
Protestants that there would be no proceedings against them for holding
the doctrines of the Augsburg Confession, or for retaining confiscated
Church property.</p>
<p>During these years of controversy and growth the new faith had
created a new Church. At Luther’s suggestion it called itself
Evangelical. He had originally advocated an ecclesiastical democracy, in
which each congrega- tion would select its own minister and determine
its own ritual and creed; but his increasing dependence on the princes
compelled him to surrender these prerogatives to commissions appointed
by, and responsible to, the state. In 1525 Elector John of Saxony
ordered all churches in his duchy to</p>
<p>THE FAITHS AT WAR</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>adopt an Evangelical service as formulated by Melanchthon with Luth
er’s approval; priests who refused to obey lost their benefices, and
obstinate lay- men, after a period of grace, were exiled. 25 Other
Lutheran princes followed a similar procedure. As a doctrinal guide for
the new churches Luther drew up a five-page Kleiner Katechismus (1529),
consisting of the Ten Com- mandments, the Apostles’ Creed, and brief
interpretations of each article. It would have been considered quite
orthodox in the first four centuries of Christianity.</p>
<p>The new ministers were generally men of good morals, learned in
Scrip- ture, careless of humanistic erudition, and devoted to the tasks
of their pastorates. Sunday was observed as the Sabbath; here Luther
accepted tra- dition rather than the Bible. “Divine service” ret ained
much of the Catholic ritual — altar, cross, candles, vestments, and
parts of the Mass in German; but a larger role was given to the sermon,
and there were no prayers to the Virgin or the saints. Religious
paintings and statues were discarded. Church architecture was
transformed to bring the worshipers within easier hearing of the
preacher; hence galleries became a regular feature of Protestant
churches. The most pleasant innovation was the active participation of
the congregation in the music of the ceremony. Even the noteless long to
sing, and now every voice could fondly hear itself in the protective
anonymity of the crowd. Luther became overnight a poet, and wrote
didactic, polem- ical, and inspirational hymns of a rough and masculine
power typical of his character. Not only did the worshipers sing these
and other Protestant hymns; they were called together during the week to
rehearse them; and many families sang them in the home. A worried Jesuit
reckoned that “the</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>THE HON OF WITTENBERG: 1 5 36-46</li>
</ol>
<p>Luther took no direct part in the pacific conferences of these his
declin- ing years; the princes rather than the theologians were now the
Protestant leaders, for the issues concerned property and power far more
than dogma and ritual. Luther was not made for negotiation, and he was
getting too old to fight with weapons other than the pen. A papal envoy
described him in 1535 as still vigorous and heartily humorous (“the
first question he asked me was whether I had heard the report, current
in Italy, that he was a Ger- man sot” 27 ) ; but his expanding frame
harbored a dozen diseases— indigestion, insomnia, dizziness, colic,
stones in the kidneys, abscesses in the ears, ulcers, gout, rheumatism,
sciatica, and palpitation of the heart. He used alcoholic</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>448</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXdrinks to dull his pain and bring him sleep; he sampled the drugs
that the doctors prescribed for him; and he tried impatient prayer; the
diseases pro- gressed. In 1537 he thought he would die of the stone, and
he issued an ulti- matum to the Deity: “If this pain lasts longer I
shall go mad and fail to - pression of his suffering. His friends
increasingly avoided him, for “hardly one of us,” said a saddened
votary, “can escape his anger and his public scourging”; and the patient
Melanchthon winced under frequent humilia - tions by his rough- hewn
idol. As for “Oecolampadius, Calvin . . . and the other heretics,” said
Luther, “they have in-deviled, through-deviled, over- deviled, corrupt
hearts and lying mouths.” 29</p>
<p>He tried hard to be reasonable in his treatise On the Councils and
the Churches (1539). He compared the various papal promises and
postpone- ments of a general council to teasing a hungry animal by
offering food and snatching it away. With considerable learning he
reviewed conciliar his- tory, and noted that several ecclesiastical
councils had been called and presided over by emperors — a hint to
Charles. He doubted if any council called by a pope would reform the
Curia. Before sanctioning Protestant attendance at a Church council “we
must first condemn the bishop of Rome as a tyrant, and bum all his bulls
and decretals.” 30</p>
<p>His political opinions in his later years suggest that silence is
trebly golden after sixty. He had always been politically conservative,
even when appear- ing to encourage social revolution. His religious
revolt was against practice rather than theory; he objected to the high
cost of indulgences, and later to papal domination, but he accepted to
the end of his fife the most difficult doctrines of orthodox
Christianity — Trinity, Virgin Birth, Atonement, Real Presence, hell —
and made some of these more indigestible than before. He despis ed the
common people, and would have corrected Lincoln’s famous error on that
spawn of carelessness. Herr Omnes — Mr. Crowd — needs strong government,
“lest the world become wild, peace vanish, and commerce . . . be
destroyed. . . . No one need think that the world can be ruled without
blood. . . . The world cannot be ruled with a rosary.” 81 But when
govern - ment by rosaries lost its power, government by the sword had to
take its place. So Luther had to transfer to the state most of the
authority that had been held by the Church; therefore he defended the
divine right of kings. “The hand that wields the secular sword is not a
human hand but the hand of God. It is God, not man, Who hangs, and
breaks on the wheel, and de- capitates, and flogs; it is God who wages
war.” 82 In this exaltation of the</p>
<p>As he aged Luther became more conservative than the princes. He
ap-</p>
<p>THE FAITHS AT WAR</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>proved the exaction of forced labor and heavy feudal dues from the
peasant; and when one baron had twitches of conscience Luther reassured
him on the ground that if such burdens were not imposed upon them
commoners would become overbearing. 83 He quoted the Old Testament as
justifying slavery. “Sheep, cattle, men -servants, and maid-servants
were all possessions to be sold as it pleased their masters. It were a
good thing were it still so. For else no man may compel nor tame the
servile folk.” 84 Every man should stay patiently in the task and walk
of life to which God has assigned him. “To serve God is for everyone to
remain in his vocation and calling, be it ever so mean and simple.” This
conception of vocation became a pillar of con - servatism in Protestant
lands.</p>
<p>A prince who had been a loyal supporter of the Protestant cause
brought Luther an uncomfortable problem in 1539. Philip of Hesse was at
once war- like, amorous, and conscientious. His wife, Christine of
Savoy, was a faithful and fertile eyesore; Philip hesitated to divorce
one so deserving, but he powerfully desired Margaret of Saale, whom he
had met while convalescing from syphilis. 88 After practicing adultery
for some time he decided that he was in a state of sin, and must abstain
from the Lord’s Supper. This p roving inconvenient, he suggested to
Luther that the new religion, so indebted to the Old Testament, should,
like it, allow bigamy — for which, however, the prevailing legal penalty
was death. After all, was this not more seemly than Francis I’s
succession of mistresses, and more humane than Henry VUI’s executive
husbandry? So anxious was Philip for his Biblical solution that he
intimated his defection to the Imperial, even the papal, camp, if the
Witten- berg theologians could not see the Scriptural light. Luther was
ready; indeed, in The Babylonian Captivity he had preferred bigamy to
divorce; he had recommended bigamy as the best solution for Henry VIII;
36 and many theologians of the sixteenth century had an open mind on the
matter. 87 Melanchthon was reluctant; he finally agreed with Luther that
their consent should be given, but that it should be withheld from the
public. Christine consented too, on condition that Philip “was to
fulfill his marital duties to - ward her more than ever before.” 38 On
March 4, 1540, Philip formally but privately married Margaret as an
additional wife, in the presence of Mel- anchthon and Bucer. The
grateful Landgrave sent Luther a cartload of wine as a pourboire . 89
When news of the marriage leaked out Luther denied giving consent; “the
secret Yea,” he wrote, “must for the sake of Christ’s Church remain a
public Nay.” 40 Melanchthon fell seriously ill, apparently with remorse
and shame, and refused to eat until Luther threatened to ex- communicate
him. 41 Melanchthon, wrote Luther, “is terribly grieved about this
scandal, but I am a tough Saxon and a sturdy peasant, and my skin has
grown thick enough to bear such things.” 42 Most Evangelicals, however,
were scandalized. Catholics were amused and delighted, not knowing
that</p>
<p>450 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXPope Clement VII had himself thought of allowing bigamy to Henry
VIII. 48 Ferdinand of Austria announced that though he had had some
inclination toward the new faith, he now abhorred it. Charles V, as the
price of not prosecuting Philip, exacted from him a pledge of support in
all future po- litical divisions.</p>
<p>Luther’s temper became hot lava as he neared the grave. In 1545 he at
- tacked the Zwinglian “Sacramentarians” with such violence that Melanch
- thon mourned the widened chasm between the Protestants of the South
and the North. Asked by Elector John to restate the case against
participation in a papally directed council, Luther sent forth a tirade
Against the Papacy at Rome Founded by the Devil (1545), in which his
flair for vituperation surpassed itself. All his friends were shocked
except the painter Lucas Cranach, who illustrated the book with woodcuts
of unrestrained satire. One showed the Pope riding on a hog and blessing
a heap of dung; another chained him and three cardinals to gibbets; and
the frontispiece pictured the Pontiff on his throne surrounded by devils
and crowned with a scaven- ger’s bucket. The word devil peppered the
text; the Pope was “the most hellish father,” “this Roman hermaphrodite”
and “Sodomite pope”; the cardinals were “desperately lost children of
the Devil . . . ignorant asses. . . . One would like to curse them so
that thunder and lightning might smite them, hell-fire burn them, the
plague, syphilis, epilepsy, scurvy, leprosy, carbuncles, and all
diseases attack them.” 44 He repudiated again the notion that the Holy
Roman Empire was a gift of the popes; on the contrary, he thought, the
time had come for the Empire to absorb the Papal States.</p>
<p>Fall to, now, Emperor, King, princes, lords, and whoever will

<p>to along with you; God brings no luck to idle hands. And first of
all,</p>
<p>take from the pope Rome, the Romagna, Urbino, Bologna, and all</p>
<p>that he has as a pope, for he got these by lies and tricks; with
blas-</p>
<p>phemies and idolatry he has shamefully filched and stolen them from
the Empire, has trampled them under foot, and therefore has led</p>
<p>countless souls to their reward in the eternal fire of hell. . . .

<p>fore ought he, the pope, his cardinals, and all the rabble of his
idolatry and papal holiness, to be taken and, as blasphemers, have their

<p>lows. 45</p>
<p>Perhaps his mind had begun to fail when he wrote this clarion call to
violence. The gradual poisoning of the internal organs by time and food
and drink may have reached and injured the brain. In his last years
Luther be- came uncomfortably stout, with hanging jowls and convoluted
chin. He had been a volcano of energy, a restless Leviathan, saying Rast
Ich, so rost Ich — “If l rest I rust.” 48 But now spells of weariness
came upon him; he de -</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE FAITHS AT WAR 45 1</p>
<p>scribed himself (January 17, 1546) as “old, decrepit, sluggish,
weary, cold, with but one good eye.” 47 “I am tired of the world, and it
is tired of me,” he wrote; 48 and when the Electress Dowager of Saxony
wished him forty more years of life , he answered, “Madam, rather than
live forty years more, I would give up my chance of paradise.” 49 “I
pray the Lord will come forth - with and carry me hence. Let Him come,
above all, with His Last Judgment; 1 will stretch out my neck, the
thunder will burst forth, and I shall be at rest.” 80 To the end he
continued to have visions of the Devil; and, now and then, doubts of his
mission. “The Devil assaults me by objecting that out of my mouth great
offenses and much evil have proceeded; and with this he many times
vehemently perplexes me.” 81 Sometimes he despaired of the</p>
<p>His will began in full character: “I am well known in heaven, on
earth, and in hell.” It told how he, “a damnable and miserable sinner,”
had received from God the grace to spread the Gospel of His Son, and how
he had won recognition as “a doctor of truth, spurning the ban of pope,
emperor, kings, princes, and priests, and the hatred of all the demons.”
And it concluded: “Wherefore, for the disposition of my meager estate
let the present witness of my hand suffice; and l et it be said:
‘Dr. Martin Luther, notary of God and the witness of His Gospel, wrote
this.’” 88 He did not doubt that God was waiting to welcome him.</p>
<p>In January 1546, he went through wintry weather to Eisleben, the
place of his birth, to arbitrate a dispute. During his absence he sent
charming letters to his wife — as on February 1 :</p>
<p>I wish you peace and grace in Christ, and send you my poor, old,</p>
<p>infirm love. Dear Katie, I was weak on the road to Eisleben, but that
was my own fault. . . . Such a cold wind blew from behind through</p>
<p>my cap upon my head that it was like to turn my brain to ice.
This</p>
<p>may have helped my vertigo, but now, thank God, I am so well that</p>
<p>I am sore tempted by fair women, and care not how gallant I am.</p>
<p>. • God bless you. 68</p>
<p>He dined merrily on February 17. Early the next morning he fell ill
with violent stomach pains. He weakened rapidly, and the friends who
gathered by his bedside made it clear that he was dying. One of them
asked him, “Reverend father, will you sta nd steadfast by Christ and the
doctrine you have preached?” He answered, “Yes.” Then an apoplectic
stroke deprived</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>452</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXhim of speech, and in its course he died (February 18, 1546). The
body was taken back to Wittenberg, and was buried in the Castle Church
on whose door he had pinned his Theses twenty-nine years before.</p>
<p>Those years were among the most momentous in history, and Luther had
been their strident and dominant voice. His faults were many. He lacked
appreciation of the historic role that the Church had played in
civilizing northern Europe, lacked understanding of mankind’s hunger for
symbolic and consolatory myths, lacked the charity to deal justly with
his Catholic or Protestant foes. He freed his followers from an
infallible pope, but sub- jected them to an infallible book; and it has
been easier to change the popes than the book. He retained the most
cruel and incredible dogmas of medieval religion, while allowing almost
all its beauty to be stamped out in its legends and its art, and
bequeathed to Germany a Christianity no truer than the old one, far less
joyous and comforting, only more honest in its teaching and personnel.
He became almost as intolerant as the Inquisition, but his words were
harsher than his deeds. He was guilty of the most vituperative writing
in the history of literature. He taught Germany the theological hatred
that incarnadined its soil until a hundred years after his death.</p>
<p>And yet his faults were his success. He was a man of war because the
situ- ation seemed to demand war, because the problems he attacked had
for centuries resisted all the methods of peace. His whole life was a
battle — against the sense of guilt, against the Devil, the Pope, the
Emperor, Zwingli, even against the friends who would have compromised
his revolt into a gentlemanly protest politely heard and carefully
forgotten. What could a milder man have done against such handicaps and
powers? No man of philo- sophic breadth, no scientific mind restricting
belief to the evidence, no genial nature making generous allowances for
the enemy, would have flung down so world-shaking a challenge, or would
have marched so resolutely, as if in blinders, to his goal. If his
predestinarian theology was as repugnant to reason and human kindness as
any myth or miracle in the medieval faith, it was by this passionate
irrationality that it moved the hearts of men. It is hope and terror
that make men pray, not the evidence of things seen.</p>
<p>It remains that with the blows of his rude fist he smashed the cake
of custom, the shell of authority, that had blocked the movement of the
Euro- pean mind. If we judge greatness by influence — which is the least
subjective test that we can use — we may rank Luther with Copernicus,
Voltaire, and Darwin as the most powerful personalities in the modem
world. More has been written about him than about any other modem man
except Shake- speare and Napoleon. His influence on philosophy was tardy
and indirect; it moved the fideism of Kant, the nationalism of Fichte,
the voluntarism of Schopenhauer, the Hegelian surrender of the soul to
the state. His influence on German literature and speech was as decisive
and pervasive as that of the</p>
<p>THE FAITHS AT WAR</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>453</p>
<p>King James Bible on language and letters in England. No other German
is so frequently or so fondly quoted. Along with Carlstadt and others,
he affected the moral life and institutions of Western man by breaking
away from clerical celibacy, and pouring into secular life the energies
that had been diverted to monastic asceticism, idleness, or piety. His
influence les- sened as it spread; it was immense in Scandinavia,
transitory in France, super- seded by Calvin’s in Scotland, England, and
America. But in Germany it was supreme; no other thinker or writer cut
so deep a mark into the German mind and character. He was the most
powerful figure in German history, and his countrymen love him not less
because he was the most German Ger- man of them all.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE TRIUMPH OF PROTESTANTISM: 1542-55</li>
</ol>
<p>He died just a year before a disaster that seemed fatal to
Protestantism in Germany.</p>
<p>In 1545 Charles V, helped by Lutheran troops, compelled Francis I to
sign the Peace of Crepy. Suleiman, at war with Persia, gave the West a
five- year truce. Pope Paul III promised the Emperor 1,100,000 ducats,
12,000 infantry, 500 horse, if he would turn his full force against the
heretics. Charles felt that at last he might effect what all along had
been his hope and policy: to crush Protestantism, and give to his realm
a unified Catholic faith that would, he thought, strengthen and
facilitate his government. How could he be a real emperor in Germany if
Protestant princes continued to flout his authority, and to dictate the
terms on which they would accept him? He had not taken Protestantism
seriously as a religion; the disputes between Luther and the Catholic
theologians meant little or nothing to him; but Protestantism as the
theology of princes leagued in arms against him, as a political power
capable of determining the next Imperial election, as the faith of
pamphleteers who lampooned him, of artists who caricatured him, of
preachers who called him Son of Satan 57 — this he could bear in somber
silence when he had to; but now for a fleeting season he was free to
fight back, and to mold his chaotic realm into one faith and force. He
decided for war.</p>
<p>In May 1546, he mobilized his Spanish, Italian, German, and Lowland
troops, and summoned to his side the Duke of Alva, his ablest general.
When the Protestant princes dispatched delegates to him at Ratisbon to
ask the meaning of his moves, he answered that he intended to restore
Germany to Imperial obedience. During that conference he won to his
support the most competent military leader in Germany, the young and
ambitious Duke Maurice of Albertine Saxony. The Fuggers promised
financial aid, and the</p>
<p>454 the reformation (chap, xx</p>
<p>Pope issued a bull excommunicating all who should resist Charles, and
offer- ing liberal indulgences to all who should aid him, in this holy
war. Charles proclaimed the Imperial ban against Duke John of Ernestine
Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse; he absolved their subjects from
allegiance to them, and vowed to confiscate their lands and goods. To
divide the opposi- tion he announced that he would not interfere with
Protestantism where it was definitely established; his brother Ferdinand
made a like pledge to Bohemia; and Maurice was tied to the cause by a
promise that he would replace John as Elector of Saxony. Hopeful or
fearful, the electors of Cologne and Brandenburg, the count Palatine,
and Protestant Nuremberg remained neutral. Realizing that not only their
theology but their goods and persons were at stake, John of Saxony,
Philip of Hesse, the princes of Anhalt, the cities of Augsburg,
Strasbourg, and Ulm mobilized all their forces, and put into the field
57,000 men.</p>
<p>But when John and Philip marched south to challenge Charles,
Ferdinand moved north and west to seize John’s duchy; and Maurice, to
have a finger in the pie, joined him in invading Ernestine Saxony.
Appraised of this, John hurried north to defend his duchy. He did it
brilliantly; but meanwhile Philip’s troops began to desert for lack of
pay, and the Protestant cities, lured by promises of fair play, sued for
peace with Charles, who let them off with heavy fines that broke the
financial backbone of their freedom. Charles was now as superior in arms
as in diplomacy. The only force favor- ing the Protestants was the Pope.
Paul III had begun to fear too great a success for the Emperor; if no
Protestant princes should survive to check the Imperial power, it would
establish itself as supreme in northern as well as southern Italy, would
surround or absorb the Papal States, and would irresistibly dominate the
papacy. Suddenly (January 1547) Paul ordered the papal troops who were
with Charles to leave him and return to Italy. They gladly obeyed. The
Pope found himself heretically rejoicing over the victories of Elector
John in Saxony.</p>
<p>But Charles was determined to bring the campaign to a decision.
March- ing north, he met the depleted forces of the Elector at Miihlberg
on the Meissen, routed them completely (April 24, 1547), and took John
captive. Ferdinand demanded the execution of the doughty prince; canny
Charles agreed to commute the sentence to life imprisonment if
Wittenberg would open its gates to him; it did, and the capital of
German Protestantism fell into Catholic hands while Luther slept
peacefully under a slab in the Castle Church. Maurice of Saxony and
Joachim of Brandenburg persuaded Philip of Hesse to surrender on their
promise that he would soon be freed. Charles had made no such pledge;
the extent of his geniality was to promise Philip release after fifteen
years. No one seemed left to challenge the victorious</p>
<p>chap. xx ) the faiths at war 455</p>
<p>Emperor. Henry VTII had died on January 28, Francis I on March 31.
Never since Charlemagne had the Imperial power been so great.</p>
<p>But the winds of fortune veered again. German princes, assembled in
an- other diet at Augsburg (September 1547), resisted the efforts of
Charles to consolidate his military victory into a legal autocracy. Paul
III accused him of conniving at the murder of Pierluigi Farnese, the
Pope’s natural son; and Bavaria, ever loyal to the Church, turned
against the Emperor. A Protestant majority re-formed among the princes,
and wrung from Charles his tem- porary consent to clerical marriage, the
double administration of the sacra- ment, and the Protestant retention
of Church property (1548). The Pope fumed at the Emperor’s assumption of
power to rule on such ecclesiastical matters, and Catholics murmured
that Charles was more interested in ex- tending his Empire and
entrenching the Hapsburgs than in restoring the one true faith. Maurice,
now Elector of Saxony at Wittenberg, found himself, Protestant and
victorious, dangerously unpopular amid a population Protes- tant and
conquered; his treachery had poisoned the power it had won. His appeals
to Charles to free the Landgrave were ignored. He began to wonder had he
chosen the better part. Secretly he joined the Protestant princes in the
Treaty of Chambord (January 1552), by which Henry II of France promised
aid in expelling Charles from Germany. While Henry invaded Lorraine and
seized Metz, Toul, and Verdun, Maurice and his Protestant allies marched
south with 30,000 men. Charles, resting on his laurels at Inns- bruck,
had carelessly disbanded his troops; he had now no defense except
diplomacy, and even at that shifty game Maurice proved his match. Ferdi-
nand proposed an armistice; Maurice prolonged the negotiations courte-
ously, meanwhile advancing on Innsbruck. On May 9, accompanied only by a
few attendants, Charles moved painfully, by litter, through rain and
snow and the night, over the Brenner Pass to Villach in Carinthia. One
throw of fortune’s dice had transformed the master of Europe into a
gouty fugitive shivering in the Alps.</p>
<p>On May 26 Maurice and the triumphant Protestants met with Ferdinand
and some Catholic leaders at Passau. Charles, after a long interlude of
self- deflation, consented to have Ferdinand sign a treaty (August 2,
1552) by which Philip was to be released, the Protestant armies were to
disband, both Protestants and Catholics were to enjoy freedom of worship
till a new diet could meet, and if that diet failed to reach an
acceptable settlement, this freedom of worship should continue forever —
a favorite word in treaties. Maurice had begun with treachery, and had
risen to victorious statesman- ship; soon (1553) he would die for his
country at the age of thirty in battle against Albrecht Alcibiades, who
had turned half of Germany into an anarchy perilous to all.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>456</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXCharles, despairing of a solution for his problems in Germany,
turned west to renew his struggle with France. Ferdinand presided with
patience over the historic Diet of Augsburg (February 5 -September 25,
1555), which at last, for half a century, gave Germany peace. He saw
that the ter- ritorial principle of ducal freedom was too strong to
allow such a central and absolute sovereignty as the kings had won in
France. The Catholic repre- sentatives were a majority in the Diet, but
the Protestants, superior in mili- tary power, bound themselves to stand
by every article of the Augsburg Confession of 1530; the Elector
Augustus, who had succeeded Maurice in Saxony, adhered to the Protestant
view; and the Catholics perceived that they must yield or renew the war.
Charles, in the senility of his diplomacy, urged the electors to name
his son Philip as his successor to the Imperial title; even the
Catholics dreaded the prospect of that dour Spaniard ruling them; and
Ferdinand, aspiring to the same throne, could not hope to win without
Protestant support in the electoral college.</p>
<p>Arms and circumstances so favored the Protestants that they demanded
everything: they were to be free in the practice of their faith in all
German territory; Catholic worship was to be forbidden in Lutheran
territory; pres- ent and future confiscations of Church property were to
be held valid and irrevocable. 68 Ferdinand and Augustus worked out a
compromise that in four famous words — cuius regio eius religio —
embodied the spiritual infirmity of the nation and the age. In order to
permit peace among and within the states each prince was to choose
between Roman Catholicism and Lutheran- ism; all his subject s were to
accept “his religion whose realm” it was; and those who did not like it
were to emigrate. There was no pretense on either side to toleration;
the principle which the Reformation had upheld in the youth of its
rebellion — the right of private judgment — was as completely rejected
by the Protestant leaders as by the Catholics. That principle had led to
such a variety and clash of sects that the princes felt justified in
restor- ing doctrinal authority, even if it had to be fractured into as
many parts as there were states. The Protestants now agreed with Charles
and the popes that unity of religious belief was indispensable to social
order and peace; and we cannot judge them fairly unless we visualize the
hatred and strife that were consuming Germany. The results were bad and
good: toleration was now definitely less after the Reformation than
before it; 69 but the princes banished dissenters instead of burning
them — a rite reserved for witches; and the resultant multiplication of
infallibilities weakened them all.</p>
<p>The real victor was not freedom of worship but the freedom of the</p>
<p>princes. Each became, like Henry VIII of England, the supreme head of
the Church in his territory, with the exclusive right to appoint the
clergy and the men who should define the obligatory faith. The
“Erastian” principle—</p>

<p>THE FAITHS AT WAR</p>
<p>457</p>
<p>that the state should rule the Church — was definitely established.*
As it was the princes, not the theologians, who had led Protestantism to
its triumph, they naturally assumed the fruits of victory — their
territorial supremacy over the emperor, their ecclesiastical supremacy
over the Church. Protestantism was nationalism extended to religion. But
the nationalism was not that of Germany; it was the patriotism of each
principality; German unity was not furthered, it was hindered, by the
religious revolution; but it is not certain that unity would have been a
blessing. When Ferdinand was chosen emperor (1558) his Imperial powers
were less than those that even the harassed and hampered Charles had
possessed. In effect the Holy Roman Empire died not in 1806 but in
1555.</p>
<p>The German cities, like the Empire, lost in the triumph of the
princes. The Imperial communes had been wards of the emperor, protected
by him against domination by the territorial rulers; now that the
emperor was crippled the princes were free to interfere in municipal
affairs, and communal independence waned. Meanwhile the growing vigor of
Holland absorbed most of the trade that poured German products into the
North Sea through the mouths of the Rhine; and the southern cities
languished with the relative commercial decline of Venice and the
Mediterranean. Commercial and po- litical enfeeblement brought cultural
decay; not for two centuries to come would the German towns show again
the vitality of trade and thought that had preceded and supported the
Reformation.</p>
<p>Melanchthon, surviving the Peace of Augsburg by five years, was not
sure that he wanted the reprieve. He had outlived his leadership, not
only in negotiations with the Catholics but in the determination of
Protestant theol- ogy. He had so far liberated himself from Luther as to
reject complete pre- destination and the bodily presence of Christ in
the Eucharist, 60 and he struggled to maintain the importance of good
works while insisting with Luther that they could not earn salvation. A
bitter controversy arose be- tween “Philippists”— Melanchthon and his
followers — and the orthodox Lutherans, who fulminated chiefly from
Jena; these called Melanchthon “an apostate Mameluke” and “servant of
Satan”; he described them as idolatrous sophistical blockheads. 61
Professors were engaged or dismissed, imprisoned or released, as the
tides of theological lava ebbed or flowed. The two parties agreed in
proclaiming the right of the state to suppress heresy by force.
Melanchthon followed Luther in sanctioning serfdom and upholding the
divine right of kings; 62 but he wished that the Lutheran movement,
instead of allying itself with the princes, had sought rather the
protection of munic- ipal burgher aristocracies, as in Zurich,
Strasbourg, Nuremberg, and Ge-</p>

<p>XXneva. In his most characteristic moments he spoke like the Erasmian
that he had hoped to be: “Let us speak only of the Gospel, of human
weaknes s and divine mercy, of the organization of the Church, and the
true worship. To reassure souls and give them a rule of right action —
is this not the essence of Christianity? The rest is scholastic debate,
sectarian disputes.” 68 When death</p>
