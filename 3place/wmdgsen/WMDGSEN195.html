<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>Augustan Statesmanship</p>
<p>30 B.C.-A.D. I 4</p>
<p>I. THE ROAD TO MONARCHY</p>
<p>F ROM Alexandria Octavian passed to Asia and continued the
reallotment of kingdoms and provinces. Not till the summer of 29 did he
reach</p>
<p>Italy. There almost all classes welcomed and feted him as a savior
and joined in a triumph that lasted three days. The Temple of Janus was
closed as a sign that for a moment Mars had had his fill. The lusty
peninsula was worn out with twenty years of civil war. Its farms had
been neglected, its towns had been sacked or besieged, much of its
wealth had been stolen or destroyed. Administration and protection had
broken down; robbers made every street unsafe at night; highwaymen
roamed the roads, kidnaped travelers, and sold them into slavery. Trade
diminished, investment stood still, interest rates soared, property
values fell. Morals, which had been loosened by riches and luxury, had
not been improved by destitution and chaos, for few conditions are more
demoralizing than poverty that comes after wealth. Rome was full of men
who had lost their economic footing and then their moral stability:
soldiers who had tasted adventure and had learned to kill; citizens who
had seen their savings consumed in the taxes and inflation of war and
waited vacuously for some returning tide to lift them back to afflu-
ence; women dizzy with freedom, multiplying divorces, abortions, and
adulteries. Childlessness was spreading as the ideal of a declining
vitality; and a shallow sophistication prided itself upon its pessimism
and cynicism. This was not a full picture of Rome, but a dangerous
disease burning in its blood. On the sea piracy had returned, rejoicing
in the suicide of states. Cities and provinces licked their wounds after
the successive exactions of Sulla, Lucullus, Pompey, Gabinius, Caesar,
Brutus, Cassius, Antony, and Octavian. Greece, which had been the
battlefield, was ruined; Egypt was despoiled; the Near East had fed a
hundred armies and bribed a thousand generals; their peoples hated Rome
as a master who had destroyed their freedom without giving them security
or peace. What if some leader should arise among them, discover the
exhaustion of Italy, and unite them in an- other war of liberation
against Rome?</p>
<p>212 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Once a virile Senate would have faced these dangers, raised sturdy
legions, found for them able captains, and guided them with far-seeing
statesman- ship. But the Senate was now only a name. The great families
that had been its strength had died out in conflict or sterility, and
the traditions of state- craft had not been transmitted to the
businessmen, soldiers, and provincials who had succeeded them. The new
Senate gratefully yielded its major powers to one who would plan, take
responsibility, and lead.</p>
<p>Octavian hesitated before abolishing the old constitution, and Dio
Cas- sius represents him as discussing the matter at great length with
Maecenas and Agrippa. Since in their judgment all governments were
oligarchies, the problem could not present itself to them as a choice
among monarchy, aris- tocracy, and democracy; they had to decide
whether, under the given condi- tions of space and time, oligarchy was
to be preferred in a monarchical form based upon an army, or an
aristocratic form rooted in heredity, or a demo- cratic form resting on
the wealth of the business class. Octavian combined them all in a
“principate” that mingled the theories of Cicero, the precedents</p>
<p>The people accepted his solution philosophically. They were no longer
enamored of freedom, but wearily wished for security and order; any man
might rule them who guaranteed them games and bread. Vaguely they under-
stood that their clumsy comitia, clogged with corruption and racked with
violence, could not govern the Empire, could not restore health to
Italy, could not even administer Rome. The difficulties of freedom
multiply with the area it embraces. When Rome ceased to be a city-state,
empire drove it inexorably toward the imitation of Egypt, Persia, and
Macedon. Out of the collapse of freedom into individualism and chaos a
new government had to be created to forge a new order for a widened
realm. All the Mediter- ranean world lay in disorder at Octavian’s feet,
waiting for statesmanship.</p>
<p>He succeeded where Caesar had failed, because he was more patient and
devious, because he understood the strategy of words and forms, because
he was willing to move cautiously and slowly where his great-uncle had
been forced by the brevity of time to wound living traditions and crowd
a generation of changes into half a year of life. Moreover, Octavian had
money. When he brought the treasury of Egypt to Rome, says Suetonius,
“money became so abundant that the interest rate fell” from twelve to
four per cent, and “the value of real estate rose enormously.” As soon
as Octavian made it clear that property rights were again sacred, that
he was through with proscriptions and confiscations, money came out of
hiding, investment took courage, trade expanded, wealth resumed its
accumulation, and some of it trickled down to the workers and the
slaves. All ranks in Italy were pleased to learn that Italy was to
remain the beneficiary, and Rome the</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP 213</p>
<p>capital, of the Empire; that the threat of a resurrected East had for
a time been laid; and that Caesar’s dream of a commonwealth with equal
rights had been replaced by a quiet return to the privileges of the
master race.</p>
<p>From this bountiful rapine Octavian first paid his debts to his
soldiers. He kept 200,000 men in service, each bound to him by an oath
of personal loyalty; the remaining 300,000 he discharged with an
allotment of agri- cultural land; and to each soldier he gave a
substantial gift of money. He lavished presents upon his generals, his
supporters, and his friends. On several occasions he made up deficits in
the public treasury from his private funds. To provinces suffering from
political depredations or acts of God he re- mitted a year’s tribute and
sent large sums for relief. He forgave property</p>
<p>While all this money slipped through his hands this bourgeois
empereur lived simply, shunning the luxuries of the nobles and the
emoluments of office, wearing the garments woven by the women in his
home, and sleep- ing always in one small room of what had been the
palace of Hortensius. When this burned down after he had occupied it for
twenty-eight years, he built his new palace on the plan of the old, and
slept in the same narrow cubiculum as before. Even when away from the
eyes of the city he lived like a philosopher rather than a prince. His
sole indulgence was to escape from public affairs by sailing leisurely
along the Campanian coast.</p>
<p>Step by step he persuaded, or graciously permitted, the Senate and
the assemblies to grant him powers that in their total made him in all
but name a king. He kept always the title of imperator, as commander in
chief of all the armed forces of the state. As the army remained for the
most part out- side the capital and usually outside Italy, the citizens
could forget, while they went through all the forms of the dead
Republic, that they were living under a military monarchy in which force
was hidden so long as phrases could rule. Octavian was chosen consul in
43 and 33, and in every year from 3 1 to 23. By the tribunician
authority conferred upon him in 36, 30, and 23, he had for life the
inviolability of a tribune, the right to initiate legislation in the
Senate or the Assembly, and the power to veto the actions of any
official in the government. No one protested against this amiable
dictatorship. The businessmen who were making hay under the sun of
peace, the senators who sniffed Octavian’s Egyptian spoils, the soldiers
who held their lands or status by his bounty, the beneficiaries of
Caesar’s laws, appointments, and will - all were now agreed with Homer
that the rule of one man is best, at least if</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>he should be so free with his funds as Octavian, so industrious and
competent, and so visibly devoted to the good of the state.</p>
<p>In 28, as co-censor with Agrippa, he took a census of the people,
revised the membership of the Senate, reduced it to 600, and was himself
named permanently prmceps senatus. The title had meant “first on the
roll call of the Senate”; soon it would mean “prince” in the sense of
ruler, just as imperator, through Octavian’s life tenure of the name,
would come to mean “emperor.” History rightly calls his government, and
that of his successors for two centuries, a “principate” rather than
strictly a monarchy; for until the death of Commodus all the “emperors”
recognized, at least in theory, that they were only the leaders (
principes ) of the Senate. To make the constitutional fa9ade of his
authority more imposing, Octavian in 27 sur- rendered all his offices,
proclaimed the restoration of the Republic, and ex- pressed his desire
(at thirty-five) to retire to private life. Perhaps the drama had been
arranged; Octavian was one of those cautious men who believe that
honesty is the best policy, but that it must be practiced with
discrimina- tion. The Senate countered his abdication with its own,
returned to him nearly all his powers, implored him to continue his
guidance of the state, and conferred upon him the title of Augustus
which history has mistaken as his name. Hitherto the word had been
applied only to holy objects and places, and to certain creative or
augmenting divinities {auger e, to increase) ; applied to Octavian it
clothed him with a halo of sanctity, and the protection of religion and
the gods.</p>
<p>The people of Rome seem to have thought for a while that the
“restoration”</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP</p>
<p>215</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE NEW ORDER</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us study this principate government in some detail, for in many
ways it was one of the subtlest political achievements in history.</p>
<p>The powers of the prince were at once legislative, executive, and
judicial: he could propose laws or decrees to assemblies or Senate, he
could administer and enforce them, he could interpret them, he could
penalize their viola- tion. Augustus, says Suetonius, regularly sat as a
judge, sometimes till night- fall, “having a litter placed upon the
tribunal if he was indisposed. . . . He was highly conscientious and
very lenient.” 1 Bearing the dut ies of so many offices, Augustus
organized an informal cabinet of counselors like Maecenas, executives
like Agrippa, generals like Tiberius, and an incipient clerical and
administrative bureaucracy chiefly composed of his freedmen and
slaves.</p>
<p>Caius Maecenas was a wealthy businessman who devoted half his life to
helping Augustus in war and peace, in politics and diplomacy, at last,
un- willingly, in love. His palace on the Esquiline was famous for its
gardens and its swimming pool of heated water. His enemies described him
as an effeminate epicurean, for he flaunted silks and gems and knew all
the lore of a Roman gourmet. He enjoyed and generously patronized
literature and art, restored Virgil’s farm to him and gave another to
Horace, inspired the Georgies and the Odes. He refused public office,
though he might have had almost any; he labored for years over
principles and details of administration and foreign policy; he had the
courage to reprove Augustus when he thought him seriously wrong; and
when he died (8 b.c.) the Prince mourned his loss as beyond repair.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was on his advice that Augustus — himself of middle-class
origin, and free from the aristocrat’s contempt of trade— named so many
businessmen to high administrative posts, even to provincial
governorships. To a Senate offended by this innovation he made amends by
many obeisances, by giving exceptional powers to Senatorial commissions,
and by gathering about him a concilium prin- cipis of some twenty men,
nearly all senators. In the course of time the decisions of this council
acquired the force of senatusconsulta , or decrees of the Senate; its
powers and functions grew as those of the Senate waned. However he might
lavish courtesies upon it, the Senate was merely his highest instrument.
As censor he four times revised its membership; he could, and did, eject
individuals from it for official incompetence or private immorality;
most of its new members were nominated by him; and the quaestors,
praetors, and consuls who entered it after their term of office had been
chosen by him or with his consent. The richest businessmen of Italy were
enrolled in the Senate, and the two orders were in some measure brought
together in that concordia of united domination which</p>
<p>21 &lt;5 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Cicero had proposed. The power of wealth checked the pride and
privilege of birth, and an hereditary aristocracy checked the abuses and
irresponsibility of wealth.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Augustus the meetings of the Senate were
confined to the first and fifteenth of each month and usually lasted but
a day. As the princeps senatus presided, no measure could be submitted
without his consent; and in fact all measures presented had been
prepared by himself or his aides. The judicial and executive functions
of the Senate now outweighed its lawmaking. It served as a supreme
court, governed Italy through commissions, and directed the per-
formance of various public works. It ruled those provinces which
required no extensive military control, but foreign relations were now
controlled by the Prince. Shorn in this way of its ancient authority,
the Senate grew negligent in even its limited functions, and yielded
ever more responsibility to the Emperor and his staff.</p>
<p>The assemblies still met, though with decreasing frequency; they
still voted, but only on measures or nominations approved by the Prince.
The right of the plebs to hold office was practically ended in 18 B.c.
by a law restricting office to men having a fortune of 400,000 sesterces
(0,000) or more. 2 Augustus ran for the consulate thirteen times and
canvassed for votes like the rest; it was a gracious concession to
dramatic technique. Corruption was hindered by requiring every candidate
to deposit, before election, a financial guarantee that he would ab-
stain from bribery. 8 Augustus himself, however, once distributed a
thousand sesterces to each voting member of his tribe to make sure that
its vote would be correct. 4 Tribunes and consuls continued to be
elected till the fifth century a.d.; 8 but as their major powers had
fallen to the Prince, these offices were ad- ministrative rather than
executive and finally became mere dignities. The actual government of
Rome was placed by Augustus in the hands of salaried regional officials,
equipped with a force of 3000 police under a praefectus urbi, or munic-
ipal police commissioner. Further to assure order of the desired kind,
and sup- port his own power, Augustus, seriously violating precedent,
kept six cohorts of a thousand soldiers each near Rome and three cohorts
within it. These nine cohorts became the Praetorian Guard — i.e., guard
of the praetorium, or head- quarters of the commander in chief. It was
this body that in a.d. 41 made Claudius emperor and began the subjection
of the government to the army.</p>
<p>From Rome the administrative care of Augustus passed to Italy and the
provinces. He conferred Roman citizenship, or the limited franchise of
“Latin rights,” upon all Italian communities that had borne their share
in the war against Egypt. He helped the Italian cities with gifts,
embellished them with new build- ings, and devised a plan whereby their
local councilors might vote by mail in the assembly elections at Rome.
He divided the provinces into two classes: those that required active
defense, and those that did not. The latter (Sicily, Baetica, Narbonese
Gaul, Macedonia, Achaea, Asia Minor, Bithynia, Pontus, Cyprus, Crete and
Cyrene, and north Africa) he allowed the Senate to rule; the others
—“imperial provinces”— were governed by his own legates, procurators, or
pre-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP 217</p>
<p>fects. This pleasant arrangement allowed him to keep control of the
army, which was mostly quartered in the “endangered” provin ces; it gave
him the lush revenue of Egypt; and it enabled him to keep an eye on the
Senatorial governors through the procurators whom he appointed to
collect the tribute in all the provinces. Each governor now received a
fixed salary, so that his tempta- tion to mulct his subjects was
moderately reduced; furthermore, a body of civil servants provided a
continuing administration and a check upon the malfeasance of their
temporary superiors. The kinglets of client states were treated with
wise courtesy and gave Augustus full allegiance. He persuaded most of
them to send their sons to live in his palace and receive a Roman
education; by this generous arrangement the youths served as hostages
until their accession, and then as un- witting vehicles of
Romanization.</p>
<p>In the flush aftermath of Actium, and possessed of an enormous army
and navy, Augustus apparently planned to extend the Empire to the
Atlantic, the Sahara, the Euphrates, the Black Sea, the Danube, and the
Elbe; the pax Romana was to be maintained not by passive defense but by
an aggres- sive policy on every frontier. The Emperor in person
completed the conquest of Spain and so ably reorganized the
administration of Gaul that it remained at peace for nearly a century.
In the case of Parthia he contented himself with the return of the
standards and surviving captives taken from Crassus in 53; but he
restored to the throne of Armenia a Tigranes favorable to Rome. He sent
abortive expeditions to conquer Ethiopia and Arabia. In the decade from
19 to 9 b.c. his stepsons Tiberius and Drusus subjugated Illyria,
Pannonia, and Raetia. Agreeably provoked by German invasions of Gaul,
Augustus ordered Drusus to cross the Rhine, and rejoiced to learn that
the brilliant youth had fought his way to the Elbe. But Drusus suffered
internal injuries from a fall, lingered in pain for thirty days, and
died. Tiberius, who loved Drusus with all the intensity of a restrained
but passionate nature, rode 400 miles on horseback from Gaul into
Germany to hold his brother in his arms in the final hours; then he
conveyed the body to Rome, walking before the cortege all the way (9
b.c.). Returning to Germany, Tiberius in two campaigns (8-7 b.c., a.d.
4-5) forced the submission of the tribes between the Elbe and the
Rhine.</p>
<p>Two disasters, coming almost together, changed this fever of
expansion into a policy of peace. In a.d. 6 the lately won provinces of
Pannonia and Dalmatia revolted, massacred all the Romans in their
territory, organized an army of 200,000 men, and threatened to invade
Italy. Tiberius quickly made peace with the German tribes and led his
depleted forces into Pan- nonia. With patient and ruthless strategy he
captured or destroyed the crops that could supply the enemy, and by
guerrilla warfare prevented new plantings, while he saw to it that his
own troops were well fed. For three</p>
<p>2 1 8</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>years he persisted in this policy despite universal criticism at
home; at last he had the satisfaction of seeing the starving rebels
disband, and of re-estab- lishing the Roman power. But in that same year
(a.d. 9) Arminius organized a revolt in Germany, lured the three legions
of Varus, the Roman governor, into a trap, and killed every man of them
except those who, like Varus, fell upon their own swords. When Augustus
heard of this he was “so deeply affected,” says Suetonius, “that for
several months he cut neither his beard nor his hair; and sometimes he
would dash his head against a door, and cry out, ‘Quintilius Varus, give
me back my legions!’” 0 Tiberius hastened to Germany, reorganized the
army there, stood off the Germans, and, by Au- gustus’ orders, withdrew
the Roman boundary to the Rhine.</p>
<p>It was a decision costly to the Emperor’s pride but cr editable to
his judg- ment. Germany was surrendered to “barbarism”— i.e., to a
nonclassic culture — and was left free to arm its growing population
against Rome. However, the same reasons that had argued for the conquest
of Germany would have demanded the subjection of Scythia — southern
Russia. Somewhere the Em- pire had to stop; and the Rhine was a better
frontier than any other west of the Urals. Having annexed northern and
western Spain, Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia, Galatia, Lycia, and
Pamphylia, Augustus felt that he had sufficiently earned his title of
“the increasing god.” At his death the Empire covered 3,340,000 square
miles, more than the mainland of the United States, and over a hundred
times the area of Rome before the Punic Wars. Augustus advised his
successor to be content with this, the greatest empire yet seen; to seek
rather to unite and strengthen it within than to extend it without. He
expressed his surprise “that Alexander did not regard it as a greater
task to set in ord er the empire that he had won than to win it.” 7 The
Pax Romana had begun.</p>

<li>SATURNIA REGNA</li>
</ol>
<p>It could not be said that Augustus had made a desert and called it
peace. Within a decade after Actium the Mediterranean knew such economic
quickening as no tradition could parallel. The restoration of order was
in itself a stimulus to recovery. The renewed safety of the seas, the
stability of government, the conservatism of Augustus, the consumption
of Egypt’s hoarded treasure, the opening of new mines and mints, the
reliability and accelerated circulation of the currency, the easing of
congested population into agricultural allotments and colonial
settlements — how could prosperity resist so unanimous an invitation? A
group of Alexandrian sailors, landing at Puteoli when Augustus was near
by, approached him in festal dress and of-</p>

<p>fered him incense as to a deity. It was because of him, they said,
that they could voyage in safety, trade in confidence, and live in
peace. 8</p>
<p>Augustus was convinced, as became the grandson of a banker, that the
best economy was one that united freedom with security. He protected all
classes with well-administered laws, guarded the highways of trade, lent
money without interest to responsible land-owners, 9 and mollified the
poor with state grain, lotteries, and occasional gifts; for the rest he
left enterprise, production, and exchange freer than before. Even so,
the works directed by the state were now of unprecedented magnitude, and
played some part in restoring economic life. Eighty-two temples were
built; a new forum and basilica were added to facilitate the operations
of finance and the courts; a new senate house replaced the one that had
incinerated Clodius; colonnades were erected to temper the sun; the
theater that Caesar had begun was completed and named after Marcellus,
son-in-law of Augustus; and rich men were prodded by the Emperor into
spending part of their fortunes in adorning Italy with basilicas,
temples, libraries, theaters, and roads. “Those that celebrated
triumphs,” says Dio Cassius, “he commanded to erect out of their spoils
some public work to commemorate their deeds.” 9a Augustus hoped to make
the majesty of Rome enhance and symbolize her power and his own. Toward
the close of his life he remarked that he had found Rome a city of brick
and had left it a city of marble. 9b It was a forgivable exaggera- tion:
there had been much marble there before, and much brick remained. But
seldom had any man done so much for a city.</p>
<p>His indispensable aide in the reconstruction of Rome was Marcus Vip-
sanius Agrippa. This perfect friend had shared with Maecenas the
guidance of Augustus’ policy. In his year as aedile (33 b.c.) Agrippa
had won the public to Octavian by opening 170 public baths, distributing
free oil and salt, presenting games for fifty-five successive days, and
providing free barbers for all citizens for a year — apparently all at
his own expense. His ability might have made him another Caesar; he
preferred to serve Augustus for a generation. So far as we know, his
life was unstained by public or private scandal; Roman gossip, which
sooner or later besmirched everyone else, left him untouched. He was the
first Roman to realize the importance of sea power. He planned, built,
and commanded the fleet, defeated Sextus Pompey, suppressed piracy, and
won a world for Augustus at Actium. After these victories and his
pacification of Spain, Gaul, and the Bosporan kingdom, he was thrice
offered a triumph and always refused. Enriched by a grateful prince, he
continued to live without luxury, and devoted himself as ardently to
public works as he had done to the preservation of the state. Out of his
own purse he hired hundreds of laborers to repair roads, buildings,</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>and sewers, and reopen the Marcian aqueduct. He constructed a new
aque- duct, the Julian, and further improved the water supply of Rome
with 700 wells, 500 fountains, and 1 30 reservoirs. When the people
complained of the high price of wine Augustus slyly remarked, “My son
-in-law Agrippa has seen to it that Rome shall not go thirsty.” 10 This
greatest of Roman engineers created a spacious harbor and shipbuilding
center by connecting the Lucrine and Avernian lakes with the sea. He
built the first of the imposing public baths that were to distinguish
Rome among the cities. He constructed, again out of his own funds, a
temple to Venus and Mars, which was rebuilt by Hadrian, is known to us
as the Pantheon, and still bears on its portico the words, m. agrippa .
. . fecit. He organized a thirty-year survey of the Empire, wrote a
treatise on geography, and made in painted marble a map of the world.
Like Leonardo he was a scientist, an engineer, an inventor of military
projectiles, and an artist. His early death at the age of fifty ( 1 2
b.c.) was among the many sorrows that darkened the later years of
Augustus, who had given him his daughter Julia in marriage, and had
hoped to bequeath the Empire to him as the man best fitted to govern it
honestly and well.</p>
<p>Costly public works combined with extended governmental services to
raise state expenditures beyond precedent. Salaries were now paid to
provincial and municipal officials, bureaucrats and police; a large army
and navy were main- tained; buildings were put up or restored without
number; corn and games bribed the populace to peace. Since expenses were
met out of current revenue, and no national debt was laid upon the
future, taxation under Augustus became a science and an unremitting
industry. Augustus was not relentless; often he forgave taxes to
harassed individuals and cities or paid them out of his personal funds.
He returned to the municipalities 35,000 pounds of gold offered him as a
“coronation gift” on the occasion of his fifth consulate; and he refused
many other donations. 12 He abolished the land tax laid upon Italy in
the Civil War; in its stead he levied upon all citizens in the Empire a
five per cent tax on be- quests to any persons except near relatives and
the poor. 18 A tax of one per cent was placed upon auction sales, four
per cent upon the sale of slaves, five per cent upon their manumission;
and custom dues from two and a half to five per cent were collected on
nearly all ports of entry. All citizens were subject also to municipal
taxes, and Roman realty did not share in Italy’s exemption from the</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP 221</p>
<p>Emperor.* To the latter came the income not only from his vast
personal prop- erties, but bequests from well-wishers and friends. Such
legacies, in the lifetime of Augustus, amounted to 1,400,000,000
sesterces.</p>
<p>All in all, taxation under the Principate was not oppressive, and
until Corn- modus the results were worth the cost. The provinces
prospered and raised altars of gratitude or expectation to Augustus the
god; even in sophisticated Rome he had to censure the people for the
extravagance of their eulogies One enthusiast ran through the streets
calling upon men and women to “devote” themselves to Augustus— i.e.,
promise to kill themselves when he died. In 2 b.c. Messala Corvinus, who
had captured Octavian’s camp at Philippi, proposed that the title of
pater patriae should be conferred upon Augustus. The Senate, pleased to
have so little responsibility while retain- ing honors and wealth,
gladly heaped upon the Emperor this and other titles of praise. The
business classes, now richer than ever, celebrated his birthday with a
two- day festival year after year. “All sorts and conditions of men,”
says Suetonius, 14 “brought him gifts on the kalends of January”— New
Year’s Day. When fire destroyed his old palace every city, apparently
every tribe and guild, in the Empire sent him a contribution to rebuild
it; he refused to take more than a denarius from any individual, but
never- theless he had more than enough. All the Mediterranean world,
after its long ordeal, seemed happy; and Augustus might believe that his
patience and labor had accomplished his great task.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE AUGUSTAN REFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>He destroyed his own happiness by trying to make people good as well
as happy; it was an imposition that Rome never forgave him. Moral reform
is the most difficult and delicate branch of statesmanship; few rulers
have dared to attempt it; most rulers have left it to hypocrites and
saints.</p>
<p>Augustus began modestly enough by seeking to check the racial trans-
formation of Rome. Population there was not declining; on the contrary,
it was growing by mass and dole attraction and the import of wealth and
slaves. Since freedmen were included in the dole, many citizens freed
old or sickly slaves to have them fed by the state; kinder motives freed
more, and many slaves saved enough to buy their liberty. As the sons of
freed- men automatically became citizens, the emancipation of slaves and
the fertility of aliens combined with the low birth rate of the native
stocks to</p>

<p>222</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>change the ethnic character of Rome. Augustus wondered what stability
there could be in so heterogeneous a population, and what loyalty to the
Empire might be expected of men in whose veins ran the blood of subject
peoples. By his urging, the lex Fufia Caninia (2 u.c.) and later
measures enacted that an owner of not more than two slaves might free
them all, the owner of from three to ten slaves might free half of them,
the owner of from eleven to thirty one-third, the owner of from
thirty-one to one hundred one-fourth, the owner of from 101 to 300
one-fifth; and no master might free more than a hundred.</p>
<p>One might wish that Augustus had limited slavery instead of freedom.
But antiquity took slavery for granted, and would have contemplated with
horror the economic and social effects of a wholesale emancipation, just
as the employers of our time fear the sloth that might come from
security. Augustus was thinking in terms of race and class; he could not
conceive a strong Rome without the character, courage, and political
ability that had marked the old Roman; above all, the old aristocracy.
The decay of the ancient faith among the upper classes had washed away
the supernatural supports of marriage, fidelity, and parentage; the
passage from farm to city had made children less of an asset, more of a
liability and a toy; women wished to be sexually rather than maternally
beautiful; in general the desire for individual freedom seemed to be
running counter to the needs of the race. To accentuate the evil, legacy
hunting had become the most profitable occupation in Italy. 10 Men
without children were sure to be courted in their declining years by
expectant ghouls; and so large a number of Romans relished this esurient
courtesy that it became an added cause of childlessness. Protracted
military service drew a considerable proportion of young men from
marriage in their most nubile years. A large number of native-stock
Romans avoided wedlock altogether, preferring prostitutes or concubines
even to a varied succession of wives. Of those who married, a majority
appear to have limited their families by abortion, infanticide, coitus
inter- ruptus, and contraception. 18</p>
<p>Augustus was disturbed by these insignia of civilization. He began to
feel that a movement backward to the old faith and morals was necessary.
Respect for the vtos viaiorwn revived in him as the years cleared his
vision and tired his frame. It was not good, he felt, for the present to
break too sharply with the past; a nation must have a continuity of
traditions to be sane, as a man must have memory. He read with aging
seriousness the historians of Rome, and envied the virtues they ascribed
to the ancients. He relished the speech of Quintus Metellus on marriage,
read it to the Senate, and recommended it to the people by imperial
proclamation. A large part of the older generation agreed with him; it
formed a land of puritan party</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP 223</p>
<p>eager to reform morals by law; and probably Livia lent them her
influence. By his powers as censor and tribune Augustus promulgated — or
passed through the Assembly — a series of laws of now uncertain date and
sequence, aimed at restoring morals, marriage, fidelity, parentage, and
a simpler life. They forbade adolescents to attend public entertainments
except in the company of an adult relative; excluded women from athletic
exhibitions, and restricted them to the upper seats at gladiatorial
games; limited expenditure on homes, servants, banquets, weddings,
jewels, and dress. The most im- portant of these “Julian laws” * was the
lex Iulia de pudicitia et de coercendis adulteriis (18 b.c.) — “The
Julian law of chastity and repressing adultery.” Here for the first time
in Roman history marriage was brought under the protection of the state,
instead of being left to the patria potestas. The father retained the
right to kill an adulterous daughter and her accomplice as soon as he
discovered them; the husband was allowed to kill his wife’s paramour if
caught in the husband’s house, but he might kill his wife only if he
found her sinning in his own home. Within sixty days of detecting a
wife’s</p>
<p>adultery, the husband was required to bring her before the court; if
he failed to do this, the woman’s father was required to indict her; if
he too failed, any citizen might accuse her. The adulterous woman was to
be banished for life, was to lose a third of her fortune and half her
dowry, and must not marry again. Like penalties were decreed for a
husband conniving at his wife’s adultery. A wife, however, could not
accuse her husband of adultery, and he might with legal impunity have
relations with registered prostitutes. The law applied only to Roman
citizens.</p>
<p>Probably at the same time Augustus passed another law, usually named
lex lulia de maritandis ordinibus, from its chapter on marriage in the
“orders” — i.e*, the two upper classes. Its purpose was threefold: to
encourage and yet restrict marriage, to retard the dilution of Roman
with alien blood, and to restore the old conception of marriage as a
union for parentage. Marriage was to be obligatory upon all marriageable
males under sixty and women under fifty. Bequests conditional on the
legatee remaining unmarried were made void. Penalties were imposed upon
celibates: they could not inherit, except from relatives, unless they
were married within a hundred days after the testat or’s death; and they
could not attend public festivals or games. Widows and divorcees might
inherit only if remarried within six months after the death or divorce
of the husband. Spinsters and childless wives could not inherit after
fifty, nor before if they possessed 50,000 sesterces (500) . Men of the
Senatorial class could not marry a freedwoman, an actress, or a
prostitute; and no actor or freedman could marry a senator’s
daughter.</p>

<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Women owning above 20,000 sesterces were to pay a one per cent annual
tax till married; after marriage this tax decreased with each child
until the third, with whose coming it ceased. Of the two consuls the one
with more children was to have precedence over the other. In
appointments to office the father of the largest family was as far as
feasible to be preferred to his rivals. The mother of three children
acquired the ius trium liberorum — the right to wear a special garment,
and freedom from the power of her husband.</p>
<p>These laws offended every class, even the puritans — who complained
that the “right of three children” dangerously emancipated the mother
from male authority. Others excused their celib acy on the score that
the “modem woman” was too independent, imperious, capricious, and
extravagant. The exclusion of bachelors from public shows was considered
too severe and impossible to enforce; Augustus had the clause rescinded
in 12 b.c. In a.d. 9 the lex Papia Poppaea further softened the Julian
laws by easing the con- ditions under which celibates might inherit,
doubling the period in which widows and divorcees must remarry to
inherit, and increasing the amount that childless heirs could receive.
Mothers of three children were freed from those limits which the lex
Vocorda (169 b.c.) had placed upon bequests to women. The age at which a
citizen might stand for the various offices was lowered in proportion to
the size of his family. After the law was passed men noted that the
consuls who had framed it and given it their names were childless
celibates. Gossip added that the reform laws had been suggested to
Augustus, who had only one child, by Maecenas, who had none; and that
while the laws were being enacted Maecenas was living in sybaritic
luxury, and Augustus was seducing Maecenas’ wife. 18</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of this, the most
important social legislation in antiquity. The laws were loosely drawn,
and recalcie&amp;nts found many loopholes. Some men married to obey the
law and divorced their wives soon afterwards; others adopted children to
secure offices or legacies and then “emancipated”— i.e., dismissed —
them. 20 Tacitus, a century later, pronounced the law s a failure;
“marriages and the rearing of chil - dren did not become frequent, so
powerful are the attractions of a childless state.” 21 Immorality
continued, but was more polite than before; in Ovid we see it becoming a
fine art, the subject of careful instructions from experts to
apprentices. Augustus himself doubted the efficacy of his laws, and
agreed with Horace that laws are vain when hearts are unchanged. 22 He
struggled heroically to reach people’s hearts: in his box at the games
he displayed the numerous children of the exemplary Germanicus; gave a
thousand sesterces to parents of large families; 28 raised a monument to
a slave girl who (doubt- less without patriotic premeditation) had borne
quintuplets ; 24 and rejoiced when a peasant marched into Rome with
eight children, thirty-six grand-</p>

<p>children, and nineteen great-grandchildren in his train . 26 Dio
Cassius pic- tures him making public addresses denouncing “race
suicide.” 20 He enjoyed, perhaps inspire d, the moral preface of Livy’s
history. Under his influence the literature of the age became didactic
and practical. Through Maecenas or in person he persuaded Virgil and
Horace to lend their muses to the propaganda of moral and religious
reform; Virgil tried to sing the Romans back to the farm in the
Georgies, and to the old gods in the Aentid; and Horace, after a large
sampling of the world’s pleasures, tuned bh lyre to stoic themes. In 17
b.c. Augustus presented the ludi saeculares <em>- three days o f
ceremonies, contests, and spectacles, celebrating the return of Saturn’s
Golden Age; and Horace was commissioned to write the carmen saeculare to
be chanted in procession by twenty-seven boys and as many girls. Even
art was used to point a moral: the lovely Ara Pads showed in relief the
life and government of Rome; magnificent public buildings rose to
represent the strength and glory of the Empire; scores of temples were
erected to stir again a faith that</em> had almost died.</p>
<p>In the end Augustus, skeptic and realist, became convinced that moral
reform awaited a religious renaissance. The agnostic generation of
Lucretius, Catullus, and Caesar had run its course, and its children had
discovered that the fear of the gods is the youth of wisdom. Even the
cynical Ovid would soon write, Voltaireanly: expedit esse deos, et ut
expedit esse puteimis: “it is convenient that there should be gods, and
that we should think they exist.” 27 Conservative minds traced the Civil
War, and the sufferings it had brought, to neglect of religion and the
consequent anger of Heaven. Every- where in Italy a chastened people was
ready to turn back to its ancient altars and thank the deities who, it
felt, had spared it for this happy restoration. When, in 12 b.c.,
Augustus, having waited patiently for the tepid Lepidus to die,
succeeded him as pontifex maximns, “such a multitude from all Italy
assembled for my election,” the Emperor tells us, “as is never recorded
to have been in Rome before .” 28 He both led and follo wed the revival
of religion, hoping that his political and moral reconstruction would
win readier acceptance if he could entwine it with the gods. He raised
the four priestly colleges to unprecedented dignity and wealth, chose
himself to each of them, took upon himself the appointment of new
members, attended their meetings faithfully, and took part in their
solemn pageantry. He banned Egyptian and Asiatic cults from Rome, but he
made an exception in favor of the Jews, and permitted religious freedom
in the provinces. He lavished gifts upon the temples and renewed old
religious ceremonies, pro- cessions, and festivals. The ludi saeculares
were not secular; every day of</p>
<p>Literally, century games, because given only at long intervals.</p>
<p>2 26</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>them was marked with religious ritual and song; their chief
significance was the return of a happy friendship with the gods.
Nourished with such sovereign aid, the ancient cult took on fresh life,
and touche^l again the dramatic impulses and supernatural hopes of the
people. Amid the chaos of competing faiths that flowed in upon Rome
after Augustus, it held its own for three centuries more; and when it
died it was at once reborn, under new symbols and new names.</p>
<p>Augustus himself became one of the chief competitors of his gods. His
great-uncle had set the example: two years after being murdered, Caesar
had been recognized by the Senate as a deity, and his worship spread
throughout the Empire. As early as 36 b.c. some Italian cities had given
Octavian a place in their pantheon; by 27 b.c. his name was added to
those of the gods in official hymns at Rome; his birthday became a holy
day as well as a holiday; and after his death the Senate decreed that
his genius, or soul, was thereafter to be worshiped as one of the
official divinities. All this seemed quite natural to antiquity; it had
never recognized an impassable difference between gods and men; the gods
had often taken human form, and the creative genius of a Heracles, a
Lycurgus, an Alexander, a Caesar, or an Augustus seemed, especially to
the religious East, miraculous and divine. The Egyptians had thought of
the Pharaohs, of the Ptolemies, even of Antony, as deities; they could
hardly think less of Augustus. The ancients were not in these cases such
simpletons as their modem counterparts would like to believe. They knew
well enough that Augustus was human; in deify- ing his genius, or that
of others, they used deus or theos as equivalent to our “canonized
saint”; indeed, canonization is a descendant of Roman deifica - tion;
and to pray to such a deified human being seemed no more absurd then
than prayer to a saint seems now.</p>
<p>In Italian homes the worship of the Emperor’s genius became
associated with the adoration given to the Lares of the household and
the genius of the paterfamilias; there was nothing difficult in this for
a people which through centuries had deified their dead parents, built
altars to them, and given the name of temples to the ancestral tombs.
When Augustus visited Greek Asia in 2 1 b.c. he found that his cult had
made rapid headway there. Dedications and orations hailed him as
“Savior,” “Bringer of Glad Tidings,” “God the Son of God”; some men
argued that in him the long -awaited Messiah had come, bringing peace
and happiness to mankind. 29 The great provincial councils made his
worship the center of their ceremonies; a new priesthood, the
Augustales, was appointed by provinces and municipalities for the
service of the new divinity. Augustus frowned upon all this, but finally
accepted it as a spiritual enhancement of the Principate, a valuable</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP</p>
<p>cementing of church and state, a uniting common worship amid diverse
and dividing creeds. Th e moneylender’s grandson consented to become a
god.</p>
<p>V. AUGUSTUS HIMSELF</p>
<p>What sort of man was this who was heir to Caesar at eighteen, master
of the world at thirty-one, ruler of Rome for half a century, and
architect of the greatest empire in ancient history? He was at once dull
and fascinating; no one more prosaic, yet half the world adored him; a
physical weakling not particularly brave, but able to overcome all
enemies, regulate kingdoms, and fashion a government that would give the
vast realm an unexampled prosperity for two hundred years.</p>
<p>Sculptors spent much marble and bronze in making images of him: some
showing him in the timid pride of a refined and serious youth, some in
the somber pose of a priest, some half covered with the insignia of
power, some in military garb — the philosopher unwillingly and uneasily
playing the general. These effigies do not reveal, though sometimes they
suggest, the ailments that made his war against chaos depend
precariously at every step upon his fight for health. He was
unprepossessing. He had sandy hair, a strangely triangular head, merging
eyebrows, clear and penetrating eyes; yet his expression was so calm and
mild, says Suetonius, that a Gaul who came to kill him changed his mind.
His skin was sensitive and intermittently itched with a kind of
ringworm; rheumatism weakened his left leg and made him limp a bit; a
stiffness akin to arthritis occasionally incapacitated his right hand.
He was one of many Romans attacked in 23 b.c. by a plague resem- bling
typhus; he suffered from stones in the bladder, and found it hard to
sleep; he was troubled each spring by “an enlargement of the diaphragm;
and when the wind was in the south he had catarrh.” He bore cold so
poorly that in winter he wore “a w oolen chest protector, wraps for his
thighs and shins, an undershirt, four tunics (blouses), and a heavy
toga.” He dared not expose his head to the sun. Horseback riding tired
him, and he was some- times carried in a litter to the battlefield. 30
At thirty-five, having lived through one of the most intense dramas in
history, he was already old- nervous, sickly, easily tired; no one
dreamed that he would live another forty years. He tried a variety of
doctors, and richly rewarded one, Antonius Musa, for curing an uncertain
illness (abscess of the liver?) with cold fomentations and baths; in
Musa’s honor he exempted all Roman physicians from taxation. 81 But for
the most part he doctored himself. He used hot salt water and sulphur
baths for his rheumatism; he ate lightly and only the plainest food —
coarse bread, cheese, fish, and fruit; he was so careful of his</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>diet that “sometimes he ate alone either before a dinner party or
after it, taking nothing duri ng its course.” 32 In him, as in some
medieval saints, the soul bore its body like a cross.</p>
<p>His essence was nervous vitality, inflexible resolution, a
penetrating, calculating, resourceful mind. He accepted an unheard-of
number of offices, and took up on himself responsibility only less than
Caesar’s. He fulfilled the duties of these positions conscientiously,
presided regularly over the Senate, attended innumerable conferences,
judged hundreds of trials, suf- fered ceremonies and banquets, planned
distant campaigns, governed legions and provinces, visited nearly every
one of them, and attended to infinite administrative detail. He made
hundreds of speeches, and prepared them with proud attention to clarity,
simplicity, and style; he read them instead of speaking
extemporaneously, lest he should utter regrettable words. Sue- tonius
would have us believe that for the same reason he wrote out in advance,
and read, important conversations with individuals, even with his wife .
38</p>
<p>Like most skeptics of his time, he retained superstitions long after
losing his faith. He carried a sealskin about him to protect against
lightning; he respected omens and auspices and sometimes obeyed warnings
derived from dreams; he refused to begin a journey on what he reckoned
to be unlucky days . 34 At the same time he was remarkable for the
objectivity of his judgment and the practicality of his thought. He
advised young men to enter soon upon an active career, so that the ideas
they had learned from books might be tempered by the experience and
necessities of life . 35 He kept to the end his bourgeois good sense,
conservatism, parsimony, and caution. Festina lente — “make haste
slowly”— was his favorite saw. Far more than most men of such power, he
could take advice and bear reproof humbly. Athenodorus, a philosopher
who was returning to Athens after living with him for years, gave him
some parting counsel: “Whenever you get angry do not say or do anything
before repeating to yourself the twenty-four let ters of the alphabet.”
Augustus was so grateful for the caution that he begged Athenodorus to
stay another year, saying, “No risk attends the reward that silence
brings .” 36</p>
<p>Even more surprising than Caesar’s development from a roistering
politi - cian into a great general and statesman was the transformation
of the merci- less and self-centered Octavian into the modest and
magnanimous Augustus. He grew. The man who had allowed Antony to hang
Cicero’s head in the Forum, who had moved without scruple from one
faction to another, who had run the gamut of sexual indulgence, who had
pursued Antony and Cleopatra to the death unmoved by friendship or
chivalry — this tenacious and unlovable youth, instead of being poisoned
by power, became in his</p>
<p>AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>last forty years a model of justice, moderation, fidelity,
magnanimity, and toleration. He laughed at the lampoons that wits and
poets wrote about him. He advised Tiberius to be content with preventing
or prosecuting hostile actions and not seek to suppress hostile words.
He did not insist upon others living as simply as himself; when he
invited guests to dinner he would retire early to leave their appetite
and merriment unrestrained. He had no pretentiousness; he buttonholed
voters to ask their suffrages; he substituted for his lawyer friends in
court; he left or entered Rome secretly, abhorring pomp; in the reliefs
of the Ara Pads he is not set apart from the other citizens by any mark
of distinction. His morning receptions were open to all citizens, and
all were affably received. When one man hesitated to present a petition
he jokingly chided him for offering the document “as if he were giving a
penny to an elephant.” 87</p>
<p>In his senile years, when disappointments had embittered him, and he
had grown accustomed to omnipotence, even to being a god, he lapsed into
intolerance, prosecuted hostile writers, suppressed histories of too
critical a stamp, and gave no ear to Ovid’s penitent verse. Once, it is
said, he had the legs of his secretary Thallus broken for taking 500
denarii to reveal the contents of an official letter; and he forced one
of his freedmen to kill him- self when found guilty of adultery with a
Roman matron. All in all, it is hard to love him. We must picture the
frailty of his body and the sorrows of his old age before our hearts can
go out to him as to the murdered Caesar or the beaten Antony.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE LAST DAYS OF A GOD</li>
</ol>
<p>His failures and his tragedies were almost all within his home. By
his three wives — Claudia, Scribonia, Livia — he had but one child:
Scribonia unwit- tingly avenged her divorce by giving him Julia. He had
hoped that Livia would bear him a son whom he might train and educate
for government; but though she had rewarded her first husband with two
splendid children — Tiberius and Drusus — her marriage with Augustus
proved disappointingly sterile. Otherwise their union was a happy one.
She was a woman of stately beauty, firm character, and fine
understanding; Augustus rehearsed his most vital measures with her and
valued her advice as highly as that of his maturest friends. Asked how
she had acquired such influence over him, she replied, “by being
scrupulously chaste . . . never meddling with his affairs, and
pretending neither to hear of nor to notice the favorites with whom he
had amours.” 38 She was a model of the old virtues, and perhaps
expounded them too persistently. In her leisure she devoted herself
to</p>
<p>230 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>charity, helping parents of large families, providing dowries for
poor brides, and maintaining many orphans at her own expense. Her palace
itself was almost an orphanage; for there, and in the home of his sister
Octavia, Au- gustus supervised the education of his grandsons, nephews,
nieces, and even the six surviving children of Antony. He sent the boys
off early to war, saw to it that the girls should learn to spin and
weave, and “forbade them to do or say anything except without
concealment, and such as might be recorded in the household diary.”

<p>Augustus learned to love Livia’s son Drusus, adopted and reared him,
and would gladly have left him his wealth and power; the youth’s early
death was one of the Emperor’s first bereavements. Tiberius he respec
ted but could not love, for his future successor was a positive and
imperious char- acter, inclined to sullenness and secrecy. But the
comeliness and vivacity of his daughter Julia must have given Augustus
many happy moments in her childhood. When she had reached the age of
fourteen he persuaded Octavia to allow the divorce of her son Marcellus,
and induced the youth to marry Julia. Two years later Marcellus died;
and Julia, after brief mourning, set out to enjoy a freedom she had long
coveted. But soon the matchmaking Emperor, craving a grandson as heir,
coaxed the reluctant Agrippa to divorce his wife and marry the merry
widow (2 1 b . c .). Julia was eighteen, Agrippa forty-two; but he was a
good and great man and agreeably rich. She made his town house a salon
of pleasure and wit, and became the soul of the younger and gayer set in
the capital as against the puritans who took their lead from Livia.
Rumor accused Julia of deceiving her new husband, and ascribed to her an
incredible reply to the incredible question why, despite her adulteries,
all the five children she gave Agrippa resembled him: Numquam nisi nave
plena tollo vectorem , 40 When Agrippa died (12 b . c .) Augustus turned
his hopes to Julia’s oldest sons, Gaius and Lucius, over - whelmed them
with affection and education, and had them promoted to office far sooner
than was legally warranted by their years.</p>
<p>Again a widow, Julia, richer and lovelier than ever, entered with
saucy abandon upon a succession of amours which became at once the
scandal and the joy of a Rome that fretted under the “Julian laws.” To
quiet this gossip, and perhaps to reconcile his daughter with his wife,
Augustus made a third match for Julia. Livia’s son Tiberius was
compelled to divorce his pregnant wife, Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of
Agrippa, and to marry the equally reluctant Julia (9 b . c .). The young
old Roman did his best to be a good husband; but Julia soon gave up the
effort to adjust her epicurean to his stoic ways, and resumed her
illicit loves. Tiberius bore the infamy for a time in furious silence.
The lex lulia de adulteriis required the husband of an adulteress to
denounce her to the courts; Tiberius disobeyed the law</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) AUGUSTAN STATESMANSHIP 231</p>
<p>to protect its author, and perhaps himself, for he and Livia had
hoped that Augustus would adopt him as his son and transmit to him the
leadership of the Empire. When it became clear that the Emperor favored,
instead, Julia’s children by Agrippa, Tiberius resigned his o fficial
posts and retired to Rhodes. There for seven years he lived as a simple
private citizen, de- voting himself to solitude, philosophy, and
astrology. Freer than ever, Julia passed from one lover to another, and
the revels of her set filled the Forum with turmoil at night. 41</p>
<p>Augustus, now (2 b.c.) an invalid of sixty, suffered all that a
father</p>
<p>and ruler could bear from the simultaneous collapse of his family,
his honor, and his laws. By these laws the father of an adulteress was
bound to indict her publicly if her husband had failed to do so. Proofs
of her misconduct were laid before him, and the friends of Tiberius let
it be known that unless Augustus acted they would accuse Julia before
the court. Augustus decided to anticipate them. While the merrymaking
was at its height, he issued a decree banishing his daughter to the
island of Pandateria, a barren rock off the Campanian coast. One of her
lovers, a son of Antony, was forced to kill himself, and several others
were exiled. Julia’s f reedwoman Phoebe hanged herself rather than
testify against her; the distraught Emperor, hear- ing of the act, said,
“I would rather have been Phoebe’s father than Julia’s.” The people of
Rome begged him to forgive his daughter, Tiberius added his request to
theirs, but pardon never came. Tiberius, enthroned, merely changed her
place of residence to a less narrow confinement at Rhegium. There,
broken and forgotten after sixteen years of imprisonment, Julia
died.</p>
<p>Her sons Gaius and Lucius had long preceded her in death: Lucius of
an illness in Marseilles (a.d. 2), Gaius of a wound received in Armenia
(a.d. 4). Left without aide or -successor at a time when Germany,
Pannonia, and Gaul were threatening revolt, Augustus reluctantly
recalled Tiberius (a.d. 2), adopted him as son and coregent, and sent
him off to put down the rebellions. When he returned (a.d. 9), after
five years of arduous and successful cam- paigning, all Rome, which
hated him for his stem puritanism, resigned itself to the fact that
though Augustus was still prince, Tiberius had begun to rule.</p>
<p>Life’s final tragedy is unwilling continuance— to outlive one’s self
and be forbidden to die. When Julia went into exile Augustus was not in
years an old man; others were still vigorous at sixty. But he had lived
too many lives, and died too many deaths, since he had come to Rome, a
boy of eighteen, to avenge Caesar’s murder and execute his will. How
many wars and battles and near-defeats, how many pains and illnesses,
how many con- spiracies and perils, and bitter miscarriages of noble
aims, had befallen him in those crowded forty-two years — and the
snatching away of one hope</p>
<p>232 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>and helper after another, until at last only this dour Tiberius
remained! Perhaps it had been wiser to die like Antony, at the peak of
life and in the arms of love. How sadly pleasant must have seemed, in
retrospect, the days when Julia and Agrippa were happy, and
grandchildren frolicked on the palace floor. Now another Julia, daughter
of his daughter, had grown up and was following her mother’s morals as
if resolved to illustrate all the</p>
<p>All the great structure that he had built seemed to be in ruins. The
powers that he had assumed for order’s sake had weakened into
degeneration the Senate and the assemblies from which he had taken them.
Tired of ratifica- tions and adulations, the senators no longer came to
their sessions, and a mere handful of citizens gathered in the covutia.
Offices that had once stirred creative ambition by the power they
brought were now shunned by the able as empty and expensive vanities.
The very peace that Augustus had organized, and the security that he had
won for Rome, had loosened the fibre of the people. No one wanted to
enlist in the army, or recognize the inexorable periodicity of war.
Luxury had taken the place of simplicity, sexual license was replacing
parentage; by its own exhausted will the great race was beginning to
die.</p>
<p>All these things the old Emperor keenly saw and sadly felt. No one
then could tell him that despite a hundred defects and half a dozen
idiots on the throne, the strange and subtle principate that he had
established would give the Empire the longest period of prosperity ever
known to mankind; and that the Pax Romana, which had begun as the Pax
Augusta, would in the perspective of time be accounted the supreme
achievement in the history of statesmanship. Like Leonardo, he thought
that he had failed.</p>
<p>Death came to him quietly at Nola in the seventy-sixth year of his
age (a.d. 14). To the friends at his bedside he uttered the words often
used to conclude a Roman comedy: “Since well I’v e played my part, clap
now your hands, and with applause dismiss me from the stage.” He
embraced his wife, saying, “Remember our long union, Livia; farewell”;
and with this simple parting he passed away . 42 Some days later his
corpse was borne through Rome on the shoulders of senators to the Field
of Mars, and there cremated while children of high degree chanted the
lament for the dead.</p>
