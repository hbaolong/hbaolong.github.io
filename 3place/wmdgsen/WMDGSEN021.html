<p>XXThe Literature of India</p>
<p>I. THE LANGUAGES OF INDIA</p>
<p>Sanskrit — T he vernaculars — Grammar</p>
<p>J UST as the philosophy and much of the literature of medieval Europe
were composed in a dead language unintelligible to the people, so the
philosophy and classic literature of India were written in a Sanskrit
that had long since passed out of common parlance, but had survived as
the Esperanto of scholars having no other common tongue. Divorced from
contact with the life of the nation, this literary language became a
model of scholasticism and refinement; new words were formed not by the
spon- taneous creations of the people, but by the needs of technical
discourse in the schools; until at last the Sanskrit of philosophy lost
the virile simplicity of the Vedic hymns, and became an artificial
monster whose sesquipedalia verba crawled like monstrous tapeworms
across the page.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile the people of northern India, about the fifth century
before Christ, had transformed Sanskrit into Prakrit, very much as Italy
was to change Latin into Italian. Prakrit became for a time the language
of Bud- dhists and Jains, until it in turn was developed into Pali — the
language of the oldest extant Buddhist literature. 2 By the end of the
tenth century of our era these “Middle Indian” languages had given birth
to various vernaculars, of which the chief was Hindi. In the twelfth
century this in turn generated Hindustani as the language of the
northern half of India. Finally the invad- ing Moslems filled Hindustani
with Persian words, thereby creating a new dialect, Urdu. All these were
“Indo - Germanic” tongues, confined to Hin - dustan; the Deccan kept its
old Dravidian languages — Tamil, Telugu, Kanarese and Malayalam — and
Tamil became the chief literary vehicle of the south. In the nineteenth
century Bengali replaced Sanskrit as the literary language of Bengal;
the novelist Chatter jee was its Boccaccio, the poet Tagore was its
Petrarch. Even today India has a hundred languages, and the literature
of Swaraji uses the speech of the conquerors.</p>

<p>55^ THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXAt a very early date India began to trace the roots, history,
relations and combinations of words. By the fourth century b.c. she had
created for herself* the science of grammar, and produced probably the
greatest of all known grammarians, Panini. The studies of Panini,
Patanjali (ca. 150 a.d.) and Bhartrihari (ca. 650) laid the foundations
of philology; and that fas- cinating science of verbal genetics owed
almost its life in modern times to the rediscovery of Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Writing, as we have seen, was not popular in Vedic India. About the
fifth century b.c. the Kharosthi script was adapted from Semitic models,
and in the epics and the Buddhist literature we begin to hear of clerks.
3 Palm- leaves and bark served as writing material, and an iron stylus
as a pen; the bark was treated to make it less fragile, the pen
scratched letters into it, ink was smeared over the bark, and remained
in the scratches when the rest of it was wiped away. 4 Paper was brought
in by the Moslems (ca. 1000 a.d.), but did not finally replace bark till
the seventeenth century. The bark pages were kept in order by stringing
them upon a cord, and books of such leaves were gathered in libraries
which the Hindus termed “Treasure - houses of the Goddess of Speech.”
Immense collections of this wooden literature have survived the
devastations of time and war.f</p>

<li>EDUCATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Schools — Methods — Universities — Moslem education — An emperor</p>
<p>on education</p>
<p>Writing continued, even to the nineteenth century, to play a very
small part in Indian education. Perhaps it was not to the interest of
the priests that the sacred or scholastic texts should become an open
secret to all. 6 As far as we can trace Indian history we find a system
of education, 1 always in the hands of the clergy, open at first only to
the sons of Brahmans, then spreading its privileges from caste to caste
until in our time it excludes only the Untouchables. Every Hindu village
had its schoolmaster, sup- ported out of the public funds; in Bengal
alone, before the coming of the British, there were some eighty thousand
native schools — one to every four</p>
<ul>
<li>The Babylonians had done likewise; cf. p. 250 above.</li>
</ul>
<p>t Of printing there is no sign till the nineteenth century-possibly
because, as in China, the adjustment of movable type to the native
scripts was too expensive, possibly because printing was looked upon as
a vulgar descent from the art of calligraphy. The printing of newspapers
and books was brought by the English to the Hindus, who bettered the
instruction; today there are 1,517 newspapers in India, 3,627
periodicals, and over 17,000 new books published in an average year.

<p>hundred population . 8 The percentage of literacy under Ashoka was
ap- parently higher than in India today . 8</p>
<p>Children went to the village school from September to February,
enter- ing at the age of five and leaving at the age of eight.“
Instruction was chiefly of a religious character, no matter what the
subject; rote memorizing was the usual method, and the Veda s were the
inevitable text. The three R’s were included, but were not the main
business of education; character was rated above intellect, and
discipline was the essence of schooling. We do not hear of flogging, or
of other severe measures; but we find that stress was laid above all
upon the formation of wholesome and proper habits of life . 11 At the
age of eight the pupil passed to the more formal care of a Guru, or
personal teacher and guide, with whom the student was to live,
preferably till he was twenty. Services, sometimes menial, were required
of him, and he was pledged to continence, modesty, cleanliness, and a
meatless diet.“ Instruction was now given him in the “Five Shastras” or
sciences: grammar, arts and crafts, medicine, logic, and philosophy.
Finally he was sent out into the world with the wise admonition that
education came only one-fourth from the teacher, one-fourth from private
study, one- fourth from one’s fel - lows, and one-fourth from life.“</p>
<p>From his Guru the student might pass, about the age of sixteen, to
one of the great universities that were the glory of ancient and
medieval India: Benares, Taxila, Vidarbha, Ajanta, Ujjain, or Nalanda.
Benares was the stronghold of orthodox Brahman learning in Buddha’s days
as in ou rs; Taxila, at the time of Alexander’s invasion, was known to
all Asia as the</p>

<p>XXbeaten by the difficulties of the problem, withdrew; and those who
were deeply versed in old and modern learning were admitted, only two or
three out of ten succeeding.” 10 The candidates who were fortunate
enough to gain admission were given free tuition, board and lodging, but
they were subjected to an almost monastic discipline. Students were not
permitted to talk to a woman, or to see one; even the desire to look
upon a woman was held a great sin, in the fashion of the hardest saying
in the New Testa- ment. The student guilty of sex relations had to wear,
for a whole year, the skin of an ass, with the tail turned upward, and
had to go about begging alms and declaring his sin. Every morning the
entire student body was required to bathe in the ten great swimming
pools that belonged to the university. The course of study lasted for
twelve years, but some students stayed thirty years, and some remained
till death. 17</p>
<p>The Mohammedans destroyed nearly all the monasteries, Buddhist or
Brahman, in northern India. Nalanda was burned to the ground in 1 197,
and all its monks were slaughtered; we can never estimate the abundant
life of ancient India from what these fanatics spared. Nevertheless, the
destroyers were not barbarians; they had a taste for beauty, and an
almost modern skill in using piety for the purposes of plunder. When the
Moguls ascended the throne they brought a high but narrow standard of
culture with them; they loved letters as much as the sword, and knew how
to combine a successful siege with poetry. Among the Moslems education
was mostly individual, through tutors engaged by prosperous fathers for
their sons. It was an aristocratic conception of education as an
ornament — occasionally an aid — to a man of affairs and power, but
usually an irritant and a public danger in one doomed to poverty or
modest place. What the methods of the tutors were we may judge from one
of the great letters of history — the reply of Aurangzeb to his former
teacher, who was seeking some sinecure and emolument from the King:</p>
<p>What is it you would have of me, Doctor? Can you reasonably</p>
<p>desire that I should make you one of the chief Omrahs of my</p>
<p>court? Let me tell you, if you had instructed me as you should
have</p>
<p>done, nothing would be more just; for I am of this persuasion,
that</p>
<p>a child well educated and instructed is as much, at least, obliged
to</p>
<p>his master as to his father. But where are those good documents*</p>
<p>you have given me? In the first place, you have taught me that</p>

<p>all Frangistan (so it seems they call Europe) was nothing but I</p>
<p>know not what little island, of which the greatest king was he of</p>
<p>Portugal,“ and next to him he of Holland, and after him he of
Eng-</p>
<p>land: and as to the other kings, as those of France and
Andalusia,</p>
<p>you have represented them to me as our petty rajas, telling me</p>
<p>that the kings of Indostan were far above them altogether, that</p>
<p>they (the kings of Indostan) were . . . the great ones, the con-</p>
<p>querors and kings of the world; and those of Persia and Usbec,</p>
<p>Kashgar, Tartary and Cathay, Pegu, China and Matchina did</p>
<p>tremble at the name of the kings of Indostan. Admirable geog-</p>
<p>raphy! You should rather have taught me exactly to distinguish</p>
<p>all those states of the world, and well to understand their
strength,</p>
<p>their Way of fighting, their customs, religions, governments, and</p>
<p>interests; and by the pursual of solid history, to observe their
rise,</p>
<p>progress, decay; and whence, how, and by what accidents and er-</p>
<p>rors those great changes and revolutions of empires and kingdoms</p>
<p>have happened. I have scarce learned of you the name of my grand-
sires, the famous founders of this empire; so far were you from</p>
<p>having taught me the history of their life, and what course they</p>
<p>took to make such great conquest. You had a mind to teach me</p>
<p>the Arabian tongue, to read and to write. I am much obliged, for-</p>
<p>sooth, for having made me lose so much time upon a language that</p>
<p>requires ten or twelve years to attain to its perfection; as if the
son</p>
<p>of a king should think it to be an honor to him to be a
grammarian</p>
<p>or some doctor of the law, and to learn other languages than of
his</p>
<p>neighbors when he can well be without them; he, to whom time is</p>
<p>so precious for so many weighty things, which he ought by times</p>
<p>to learn. As if there were any spirit that did not with some
reluc-</p>
<p>tancy, and even with a kind of debasement, employ itself in so
sad</p>
<p>and dry an exercise, so longsome and tedious, as is that of
learning</p>
<p>words . 18</p>
<p>“Thus,” says the contemporary Bernier, “did Aurangzeb resent the</p>
<p>pedantic instructions of his tutors; to which ’tis affirmed in that
court that</p>

<p>is ordinarily accompanied with an happy memory, is capable of</p>

deeply</p>
<p>impressed the whole remainder of a man’s life, and keep the mind</p>
<p>always raised for great actions? The law, prayers and sciences,</p>
<p>may they not as well be learned in our mother-tongue as in Ara-</p>
<p>bick? You told my father Shah Jehan that you would teach me</p>
<p>philosophy. ’Tis true, I remember very well, that you have en -</p>
<p>tertained me for many years with airy questions of things that
af-</p>
<p>ford no satisfaction at all to the mind, and are of no use in
humane</p>
<p>society, empty notions and mere fancies, that have only this in them,
that they are very hard to understand and very easy to forget. … I</p>
<p>still remember that after you had thus amused me, I know not</p>
<p>how long, with your fine philosophy, all I retained of it was a
mul-</p>
<p>titude of barbarous and dark words, proper to bewilder, perplex and
tire out the best wits, and only invented the better to cover the</p>
<p>vanity and ignorance of men like yourself, that would make us be-</p>
<p>lieve that they know all, and that under those obscure and am-</p>
<p>biguous words are hid great mysteries which they alone are capa-</p>
<p>ble to understand. If you had seasoned me with that philosophy</p>
<p>which formeth the mind to ratiocination, and insensibly accustoms</p>
<p>it to be satisfied with nothing but solid reasons, if you had
given</p>
<p>me those excellent precepts and doctrines which raise the soul above
the assaults of fortune, and reduce her to an unshakable and always
equal temper, and permit her not to be lifted up by prosperity nor</p>
<p>debased by adversity; if you had taken care to give me the knowl-</p>
<p>edge of what we are and what are the first principles of things,</p>
<p>and had assisted me in forming in my mind a fit idea of the
great-</p>
<p>ness of the universe, and of the admirable order and motion of
the</p>
<p>parts thereof; if, I say, you had instilled into me this kind of
phil-</p>
<p>osophy, I should think myself incomparably more obliged to you</p>
<p>than Alexander was to his Aristotle, and believe it my duty to</p>
<p>recompense you otherwise than he did him. Should you not, in-</p>
<p>stead of your flattery, have taught me somewhat of that point so</p>
<p>important to a king, which is, what the reciprocal duties are of
a</p>
<p>sovereign to his subjects and those of subjects to their
sovereigns;</p>
<p>and ought not you to have considered that one day I should be</p>
<p>obliged with the sword to dispute my life and my crown with my</p>
<p>brothers? . . . Have you ever taken any care to make me learn</p>
<p>what ’tis to besiege a town, or to set an army in array? For
these</p>
<p>things I am obliged to others, not at all to you. Go, and return

<li>THE EPICS</li>

<p>The “ Mahabharata”— Its story — Its form — The “ Bhagavad - Giu
r”—</p>
<p>The metaphysics of war — The price of freedom — The “ Ra -</p>
<p>may ana”— A forest idyl — The rape of Sita — The Hindu</p>
<p>epics and the Greek</p>
<p>The schools and the universities were only a part of the educational
system of India. Since writing was less highly valued than in other
civili- zations, and oral instruction preserved and disseminated the
nation’s his - tory and poetry, the habit of public recitation spread
among the people the most precious portions of their cultural heritage.
As nameless racon- teurs among the Greeks transmitted and expanded the
Iliad and the Odyssey, so the reciters and declaimers of India carried
down from</p>
<p>generation to generation, and from court to people, the ever-growing
epics into which the Brahmans crowded their legendary lore.</p>
<p>A Hindu scholar has rated the Mahabharata as “the greatest work of
imagination that Asia has produced” “ and Sir Charles Eliot has c alled
it “a greater poem than the Iliad .” a In one sense there is no doubt
about the latter judgment. Beginning (ca. 500 b.c.) as a brief narrative
poem of reasonable length, the Mahabharata took on, with every century,
addi- tional episodes and homilies, and absorbed the Bhagavad-Gita as
well as parts of the story of Rama, until at last it measured 107,000
octameter couplets — seven times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey
combined. The name of the author was legion; “Vyasa,” to whom tradition
assigns it, means “the arranger.” 23 A hundred poets wrote it, a
thousand singers moulded it, until, under the Gupta kings (ca. 400
a.d.), the Brahmans poured their own religious and moral ideas into a
work originally Ksha- triyan, and gave the poem the gigantic form in
which we find it today.</p>
<p>The central subject was not precisely adapted to religious
instruction, for it told a tale of violence, gambling and war. Book One
presents the fair Shakuntala (destined to be the heroine of India’s most
famou s drama) and her mighty son Bharata; from his loins come those
“great Bharata”</p>

soil. The twelve years pass; the Pandavas call upon the Kurus to restore
their land; they receive no answer, and declare war. Allies are brought
in on either side, until almost all northern India is engaged.* The
battle rages for eighteen days and five books; all the Kurus are slain,
and nearly all the Pandavas; the heroic Bhishma alone slays 100,000 men
in ten days; alto- gether, the poet-statistician reports, the fallen
numbered several hundred million men . 23 Amid this bloody scene of
death Gandhari, queen consort of the blind Kuru king, Dhrita-rashtra,
wails with horror at the sight of vultures hovering greedily over the
corpse of Prince Duryodhan, her son.</p>

slain,</p>

<p>Mothers hug their slaughtered children all unconscious in their</p>
<p>sleep,</p>
<p>Widows bend upon their husbands and in ceaseless sorrow</p>
<p>weep. . .</p>
<p>Thus to Krishna Queen Gandhari strove her woeful thoughts to
tell,</p>
<p>When, alas, her wandering vision on her son Duryodhan fell.</p>
<p>Sudden anguish smote her bosom, and her senses seemed to stray;</p>
<p>Like a tree by tempest shaken, senseless on the earth she lay.</p>
<p>Once again she waked in sorrow, once again she cast her eye</p>
<p>Where her son in blood empurpled slept beneath the open sky.</p>
<p>And she clasped her dear Duryodhan, held him close unto her breast,
Sobs convulsive shook her bosom as the lifeless form she prest,</p>
<p>And her tears like rains of summer fell and washed his noble
head,</p>
<p>Decked with garlands still untarnished, graced with nishkas
bright</p>
<p>and red.</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother,’ said my dear Duryodhan, when he went unto the war,</p>
<p>‘Wish me joy and wish me triumph as I mount the battle - car.’</p>
<p>‘Son,’ I said to dear Duryodhan, ’Heaven avert a cruel fate,</p>
<p>Yato dharma stato jay ah — triumph doth on virtue wait.’</p>
<p>But he set his heart on battle, by his valor wiped his sins;</p>
<p>Now he dwells in realms celestial which the faithful warrior
wins.</p>
<p>And I weep not for Duryodhan, like a prince he fought and fell,</p>
<p>But my sorrow-stricken husband, who can his misfortunes tell? . .

<p>“Hark the loathsome cry of jackals, how the wolves their vigils</p>

<p>Maidens rich in song and beauty erst were wont to watch his sleep.

<p>Tom from husband’s sweet embraces, from her son’s entwining</p>

<p>Doomed to life-long woe and anguish in her youth and in her</p>
<p>charms.</p>
<p>564 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XT</p>
<p>Rend my hard and stony bosom crushed beneath this cruel pain,</p>
<p>Should Gandhari live to witness noble son and grandson slain?</p>
<p>Mark again Duryodhan’s widow, how she hugs his gory head.</p>
<p>How with gentle hands and tender softly holds him on his bed;</p>
<p>How from dear departed husband turns she to her dearest son,</p>
<p>And the tear- drops of the mother choke the widow’s bitter groan;</p>
<p>Like the fibre of the lotus tender-golden is her frame.</p>
<p>O my lotus, O my daughter, Bharat’s pride and Kuru’s fame!</p>
<p>If the truth resides in Vedas, brave Duryodhan dwells above;</p>
<p>Wherefore linger we in sadness severed from his cherished love?</p>
<p>If the truth resides in Shastra, dwells in sky my hero son;</p>
<p>Wherefore linger we in sorrow since their earthly task is done?” 25
*</p>
<p>Upon this theme of love and battle a thousand interpolations have
been hung. The god Krishna interrupts the slaughter for a canto to
discourse on the nobility of war and Krishna; the dying Bhishma
postpones his death to expound the laws of caste, bequest, marriage,
gifts and funeral rites, to explain the philosophy of the Sankhya and
the Upanishads, to narrate a mass of legends, traditions and myths, and
to lecture Yudishthira at great length on the duties of a king; dusty
stretches of genealogy and geography, of theology and metaphysics,
separate the oases of drama and action; fables and fairy-tales,
love-stories and lives of the saints contribute to give the Mahabharata
a formlessness worse, and a body of thought richer, than can be found in
either the Iliad or the Odyssey. What was evidently a Kshatriyan
enthronement of action, heroism and war becomes, in the hands of the
Brahmans, a vehicle for teaching the people the laws of Manu, the
principles of Yoga, the precepts of morality, and the beauty of Nirvana.
The Golden Rule is expressed in many forms;* moral aphor- isms of beauty
and wisdom abound;f and pretty stories of marital fidelity (Nala and
Damayanti, Savitri) convey to women listeners the Brahman ideal of the
faithful and patient wife.</p>
<p>Embedded in the narrative of the great battle is the loftiest
philosophical poem in the world’s literature— the Bhagavad- Gita, or
Lord’s Song. This</p>

<p>565</p>
<p>is the New Testament of India, revered next to the Vedas themselves,
and used in the law-courts, like our Bible or the Koran, for the
administration of oaths . 28 Wilhelm von Humboldt pronounced it “the
most beautiful, perhaps the only true, philosophical song existing in
any known tongue; . . . perhaps the deepest and loftiest thing the world
has to show .” 20 Sharing the anonymity that India, careless of the
individual and the par- ticular, wraps around her creations, the Gita
comes to us without the author’s name, and wit hout date. It may be as
old as 400 b.c ., 30 or as young as 200 a . d . 31</p>
<p>The mise-en-scene of the poem is the battle between the Kurus and the
Pandavas; the occasion is the reluctance of the Panda va warrior Arjuna
to attack in mortal combat his own near relatives in the opposing force.
To Lord Krishna, fighting by his side like some Homeric god,</p>
<p>Arjuna speaks the philosophy of Gandhi and Christ:</p>
<p>“As I behold— come here to shed</p>
<p>Their common blood — yon concourse of our kin,</p>
<p>My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth. . . .</p>
<p>It is not good, O Keshav! Naught of good</p>
<p>Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate</p>
<p>Triumph and domination, wealth and ease</p>
<p>Thus sadly won! Alas, what victory</p>
<p>Can bring delight, Govinda, what rich spoils</p>
<p>Could profit, what rule recompense, what span</p>
<p>Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? . . .</p>
<p>Thus if we slay</p>
<p>Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,</p>
<p>Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!</p>
<p>Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,</p>
<p>To face them weaponless, and bare my breast</p>
<p>To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow .” 38</p>
<p>Thereupon Krishna, whose divinity does not detract from his joy
in</p>
<p>battle, explains, with all the authority of a son of Vishnu, that
according to the Scriptures, and the best orthodox opinion, it is meet
and just to kill one’s relatives in war; that Arj una’s duty is to
follow the rules of his</p>
<p>Kshatriya caste, to fight and slay with a good conscience and a good
will; that after all, only the body is slain, while the soul survives.
And he ex-</p>

the Upanishads:</p>
<p>“Indestructible,</p>
<p>Learn thou, the Life is, spreading life through all;</p>
<p>It cannot anywhere, by any means,</p>
<p>Be anywise diminished, stayed or changed.</p>
<p>But for these fleeting frames which it informs</p>
<p>With spirit deathless, endless, infinite —</p>
<p>They perish. Let them perish, Prince, and fight!</p>
<p>He who shall say, *Lo, I have slain a man!’</p>
<p>He who s hall think, ‘Lo, I am slain!’ those both</p>
<p>Know naught. Life cannot slay! Life is not slain!</p>
<p>Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;</p>
<p>Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!</p>
<p>Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit
forever;</p>
<p>Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it</p>
<p>seems .” 88</p>
<p>Krishna proceeds to instruct Arjuna in metaphysics, blending Sankhya
and Vedanta in the peculiar synthesis accepted by the Vaishnavite sect.
All things, he says, identifying himself with the Supreme Being,</p>
<p>“hang on me</p>
<p>As hangs a row of pearls upon its string.</p>
<p>I am the fresh taste of the water; I</p>
<p>The silver of the moon, the gold o’ the sun,</p>

<p>The outcaste gorging dog’s meat, all are one .” 84</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA 567</p>
<p>It is a poem rich in complementary colors, in metaphysical and
ethical contradictions that reflect the contrariness and complexity of
life. We are a little shocked to find the man taking what might seem to
be the higher moral stand, while the god argues for war and slaughter on
the shifty ground that life is unkillable and individuality unreal. What
the author had in mind to do, apparently, was to shake the Hindu soul
out of the enervating quietism of Buddhist piety into a willingness to
fight for India; it was the rebellion of a Kshatriya who felt that
religion was weakening his country, and who proudly reckoned that many
things were more precious than peace. All in all it was a good lesson
which, if India had learned it, might have kept her free.</p>
<p>The second of the Indian epics is the most famous and best beloved of
all Hindu books , 35 and lends itself more readily than the Mahabharata
to Occidental understanding. The Ramayana is briefer, merely running to
a thousand pages of forty-eight lines each; and though it, too, grew by
accretion from the third century b.c. to the second century a.d., the
inter- polations are fewer, and do not much disturb the central theme.
Tradition attributes the poem to one Valmiki, who, like the supposed
author of the larger epic, appears as a character in the tale; but more
probably it is the product of many wayside bards like those who still
recite these epics, sometimes for ninety consecutive evenings, to
fascinated audiences . 53</p>
<p>As the Mahabharata resembles the Iliad in being the story of a great
war fought by gods and men, and partly occasioned by the loss of a beau-
tiful woman from one nation to another, so the Ramayana resembles the
Odyssey, and tells of a hero’s hardships and wanderings, and of his
wife’s patient waiting for reunion with him.” At the outset we get a
picture of a Golden Age, when Dasa-ratha, from his capital Ayodhya,
ruled the king- dom of Kosala (now Oudh).</p>
<p>Rich in royal worth and valor, rich in holy Vedic lore,</p>
<p>Dasa-ratha ruled his empire in the happy days of yore. . . .</p>
<p>Peaceful lived the righteous people, rich in wealth, in merit
high;</p>
<p>Envy dwelt not in their bosoms, and their accents shaped no lie.</p>
<p>Fathers with their happy households owned their cattle, com and</p>
<p>gold;</p>
<p>Galling penury and famine in Ayodhya had no hold . 58</p>
<p>5^8 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXNearby was another happy kingdom, Videha, over which King Janak
ruled. He himself “held the plough and tilled the earth” like some
doughty Cincinnatus; and one day, at the touch of his plough, a lovely
daughter, Sita, sprang up from a furrow of the soil. Soon Sita had to be
married, and Janak held a contest f or her suitors: he who could unbend
Janak’s bow of war should win the bride. To the contest came the oldest
son of Dasa- ratha — Rama “lion -chested, mighty armed, lotus-eyed,
stately as the jungle tusker, with his crown of tresses tied.” 39 Only
Rama ben t the bow; and Janak offered him his daughter with the
characteristic formula of Hindu marriage:</p>
<p>This is Sita, child of Janak, dearer unto him than life;</p>
<p>Henceforth sharer of thy virtue, be she, prince, thy faithful
wife;</p>
<p>Of thy weal and woe partaker, be she thine in every land;</p>
<p>Cherish her in joy and sorrow, clasp her hand within thy hand;</p>
<p>As the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife,</p>
<p>And my Sita, best of women, follows thee in death or life.”“</p>
<p>So Rama returns to Ayodhya with his princess-bride — “ivory brow and
lip of coral, sparkling teeth of pearly sheen”— and wins the love of the
Kosalas by his piety, his gentleness, and his generosity. Suddenly evil
enters into this Eden in the form of Dasa- ratha’s second wife, Kaikeyi
. Dasa-ratha has promised her any boon she may ask; and now, jealous of
the first wife, whose son Rama is heir to the throne, she requires
Dasa-ratha to banish Rama from the kingdom for fourteen years.
Dasa-ratha, with a sense of honor which only a poet unacquainted with
politics could con- ceive, keeps his word, and, broken-hearted, exiles
his favorite son. Rama forgives him handsomely, and prepares to go and
live in the forest, alone; but Sita insists upon going with him. Her
speech is part of the memory of almost every Hindu bride:</p>
<p>“Car and steed and gilded palace, vain are these to woman’s life;</p>
<p>Dearer is her husband’s shadow to the loved and loving wife. . .
.</p>
<p>Happier than in father’s mansions, in the woods will Sita rove,</p>
<p>Waste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her hus-</p>
<p>band’s love. …</p>
<p>And the wild fruit she will gather from the fresh and fragrant</p>
<p>wood,</p>
<p>And the food by Rama tasted shall be Sita’s cherished food.”* 1</p>
<p>5 6 9</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA</p>
<p>Even his brother Lakshman begs leave to accompany Rama:</p>
<p>“All alone with gentle Sita thou shalt trace thy darksome way;</p>
<p>Grant it that thy faithful Lakshman shall protect her night and
day;</p>
<p>Grant it with his bow and quiver Lakshman shall all forests roam,</p>
<p>And his axe shall fell the jungle, and his hands shall rear the</p>
<p>home .” 43</p>
<p>The epic becomes at this point a sylvan idyl, telling how Rama,
Sita</p>
<p>and Lakshman set out for the woods; how the population of Ayodhya,
mourning for them, travel with them all the first day; how the exiles
steal away from their solicitous company at night, abandon all their
valuables and princely raiment, dress themselves in bark and matted
grass, clear a way through the forest with their swords, and live on the
fruits and nuts of the trees.</p>
<p>Oft to Rama turned his consort, pleased and curious ever more.</p>
<p>Asked the name of tree or creeper, fruit oi flower unseen before. . .
.</p>
<p>Peacocks flew around them gayly, monkeys leapt on branches</p>
<p>bent. …</p>
<p>Rama plunged into the river ’neath the morning’s crimson beam,</p>
<p>Sita softly sought the waters as the lily seeks the stream . 43</p>
<p>They build a hut beside the river, and learn to love their life in
the</p>
<p>woods. But a southern princess, Surpa-nakha, wandering in the forest,
meets Rama, falls in love with him, resents his virtue, and instigates
her brother Ravan to come and kidnap Sita. He succeeds, snatches her
away to his distant castle, and tries in vain to seduce her. Since
nothing is im- possible to gods and authors, Rama raise s a great army,
invades Ravan’s realm, defeats him in battle, rescues Sita, and then
(his years of exile having ended) flies with her in an airplane back to
Ayodhya, where another loyal - brother gladly surrenders to him the
Kosala throne.</p>
<p>In what is probably a later epilogue, Rama gives way to the
sceptics</p>
<p>who will not believe that Sita could have been so long in Ravan’s
palace without being occasionally in his arms. Though she passes through
the Ordeal of Fire to prove her innocence, he sends her away to a forest
hermitage with that bitter trick of heredity whereby one generation
repeats upon the next the sins and errors which it suffered from its
elders in its youth. In the woods Sita meets Valmiki, and bears two sons
to Rama.</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXMany years later these sons, as traveling minstrels, sing before
the unhappy Rama the epic composed about him by Valmiki from Sita’s
memories. He recognizes the boys as his own, and sends a message begging
Sita to return. But Sita, broken-hearted over the suspicion to which she
has been sub- jected, disappears into the earth that was once her
mother. Rama reigns many years in loneliness and sorrow, and under his
kindly sway Ayodhya knows again the Utopia of Dasa-rath a’s days:</p>
<p>And ’tis told by ancient sages, during Rama’s happy reign,</p>
<p>Death untimely, dire diseases, came not to his subject men;</p>
<p>Widows wept not in their sorrow for their lords untimely lost,</p>
<p>Mothers wailed not in their anguish for their babes by Yama
crost;</p>
<p>Robbers, cheats and gay deceivers tempted not with lying word.</p>
<p>Neighbor loved his righteous neighbor, and the people loved their</p>
<p>lord.</p>
<p>Trees their ample produce yielded as returning seasons went,</p>
<p>And the earth in grateful gladness never-failing harvest lent.</p>
<p>Rains descended in their season, never came the blighting gale,</p>
<p>Rich in crop and rich in pasture was each soft and smiling vale.</p>
<p>Loom and anvil gave their produce, and the tilled and fertile
soil,</p>
<p>And the nation lived rejoicing in their old ancestral toil . 14</p>
<p>It is a delightful story, which even a modern cynic can enjoy if he
is</p>
<p>wise enough to yield himself now and then to romance and the lilt of
song. These poems, though perhaps inferior to the epics of Homer in
literary quality — in logic of structure, and splendor of language, in
depth of por- traiture and fidelity to the essence of things — are
distinguished by fine feeling, a lofty idealization of woman and man,
and a vigorous — sometimes realistic — representation of life. Rama and
Sita are too good to be true, but Draupadi and Yudhishthira,
Dhrita-rashtra and Gandhari, are almost as living as Achilles and Helen,
Ulysses and Penelope. The Hindu would rightly protest that no foreigner
can judge these epics, or even understand them. To him they are not mere
stories, they are a gallery of ideal char- acters upon whom he may mould
his conduct; they are a repertory of the traditions, philosophy and
theology of his people; in a sense they are sacred scriptures to be read
as a ( Christian reads The Imitation of Christ or The Lives of the
Saints. The pious Hindu believes that Krishna and Rama were incarnations
of divinity, and still prays to them; and when he reads their story in
these epics he feels that he derives religious merit as well as
literary</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA 571</p>
<p>delight and moral exaltation. He trusts that if he reads the Ramayana
he will be cleansed of all sin, and will beget a son ; 45 and he accepts
with simple faith the proud conclusion of the Mahabharata:</p>
<p>If a man reads the Mahabharata and has faith in its doctrines, he</p>
<p>becomes free from all sin, and ascends to heaven after his death. . .
.</p>
<p>As butter is to all other food, as Brahmans are to all other men,</p>
<p>… as the ocean is to a pool of water, as the cow is to all other</p>
<p>quadrupeds — so is the Mahabharata to all other histories. . . .
He</p>
<p>who attentively listens to the shlokas* of the Mahabharata , and has
faith in them, enjoys a long life and solid reputation in this
world,</p>
<p>and an eternal abode in the heavens in the next . 46</p>

<p>Origins — “The Clay Cart”— Characteristics of Hindu drama — Kali-</p>
<p>dasa — The story of “Shakuntala” — Estimate of Indian</p>
<p>drama</p>
<p>In one sense drama in India is as old as the Vedas , for at least the
germ of drama lies in the Upanishads. Doubtless older than these
Scriptures is a more active source of the drama — the sacrificial and
festival ceremonies and processions of religion. A third origin was in
the dance — no mere release of energy, much less a substitute for
coitus, but a serious ritual imitating and suggesting actions and events
vital to the tribe. Perhaps a fourth source lay in the public and
animated recitation of epic verse. These factors cooperated to produce
the Indian theatre, and gave it a religious stamp that lingered
throughout the classic agef in the serious nature of the drama, the
Vedic or epic source of its subjects, and the benediction that always
preceded the play.</p>
<p>Perhaps the final stimulus to drama came from the intercourse,
established by Alexander’s invasion, between India and Greece. We have
no evidence of Hindu dramas before Ashoka, and only uncertain evidence
during his reign. The oldest extant Hindu plays are the palm-leaf
manuscripts lately discovered in Chinese Turkestan. Among them were
three dramas, one of which names as its author Ashvaghosha, a
theological luminary at Kanishka’s court. The technical form of this
play, and the resemblance of its buffoon</p>

<li>Couplets.</li>
</ul>
<p>fl.e., the age in which literature used Sanskrit as its medium.</p>
<p>572 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXto the type traditionally characteristic of the Hindu theatre,
suggest that drama was already old in India when Ashvaghosha was born.
47 In 1910 thirteen ancient Sanskrit plays were found in Travancore,
which are dubi- ously ascribed to Bhasa (ca. 350 a.d.), a dramatic
predecessor much honored by Kalidasa. In the prologue to his Malavika
Kalidasa unconsciously but admirably illustrates the relativity of time
and adje ctives: “Shall we,” he asks, “neglect the works of such
renowned authors as Bhasa, Saumilla, and Kaviputra? Can the audience
feel any respect for the work of a modern poet, a Kalidasa?” 48</p>
<p>Until recently, the oldest Hindu play known to research was The Clay
Cart. The text, which need not be believed, names as author of the play
an obscure King Shudraka, who is described as an expert in the Vedas ,
in mathematics, in the management of elephants, and in the art of love .
40 In any event he was an expert in the theatre. His play is by all
means the most interesting that has come to us from India — a clever
combination of melodrama and humor, with excellent passages of poetic
fervor and de- scription.</p>
<p>A synopsis of its plot will serve better than a volume of commentary
to illustrate the character of Indian drama. In Act I we meet
Charu-datta, once rich, now impoverished by generosity and bad fortune.
His friend Maitreya, a stupid Brahman, acts as jester in the play. Charu
asks Maitreya to offer an oblation to the gods, but the Brahman refuses,
saying: “What’s the use,</p>
<p>when the gods you have worshiped have done nothing for you?” Suddenly
a young Hindu woman, of high family and great wealth, rushes into</p>
<p>Cham’s courtyard, seeking refuge from a pur suer who turns out to be
the King’s brother, Samsthanaka— as completely and incredibly evil as
Charu is completely and irrevocably good. Cham protects the girl, sends
Samsthanaka off, and scorns the latter’s threat of vengeance. The girl,
Vasanta -sena, asks Cham to keep a casket of jewels in safe custody for
her, lest her enemies steal it from her, and lest she may have no excuse
for revisiting her rescuer. He agrees, takes the casket, and escorts her
to her palatial home.</p>
<p>Act II is a comic interlude. A gambler, running away from two
other</p>
<p>gamblers, takes refuge in a temple. When they enter he eludes them by
pos- ing as the idol of the shrine. The pursuing gamblers pinch him to
see if he is really a stone god, but he does not move. They abandon
their search, and console themselves with a game of dice at the foot of
the altar. The game becomes so exciting that the “statue,” unable to
control himself, leaps off his pedestal, and asks leave to take part.
The others beat him; he again finds</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA 573</p>
<p>help in his heels, and is saved by Vasanta-sena, who recognizes in
him a former servant of Charu-datta.</p>
<p>Act III shows Charu and Maitreya returning from a concert. A
thief,</p>
<p>Sharvilaka, breaks in, and steals the casket. Charu, discovering the
theft, feels disgraced, and sends Vasanta-sena his last string of pearls
as a substitute.</p>
<p>In Act IV Sharvilaka is seen offering the stolen casket to Vasanta-
sena’s maid as a bribe for her love. Seeing that it is her mistress’ c
asket, she berates Sharvilaka as a thief. He answers her with
Schopenhauerian acerbity:</p>
<p>A woman will for money smile or weep</p>
<p>According to your will; she makes a man</p>
<p>Put trust in her, but trusts him not herself.</p>
<p>Women are as inconstant as the waves</p>
<p>Of ocean, their affection is as fugitive</p>
<p>As streak of sunset glow upon a cloud.</p>
<p>They cling with eager fondness to the man</p>
<p>Who yields them wealth, which they squeeze out like sap</p>
<p>Out of a juicy plant, and then they leave him.</p>
<p>The maid refutes him by forgiving him, and Vasanta-sena by allowing
them to marry.</p>
<p>At the opening of Act V Vasanta- sena comes to Charu’s house to
return both his jewels and her casket. While she is there a storm blows
up, which she describes in excellent Sanskrit.* The storm obligingly
increases its fury, and compels her, much according to her will, to
spend the night under Charu’s roof.</p>
<p>Act VI shows Vasanta leaving Charu’s house the next morning. By mis -
take she steps not into the carriage he has summoned for her, but into
one which belongs to the villainous Samsthanaka. Act VII is concerned
with a subordinate plot, inessential to the theme. Act VIII finds
Vasanta deposited, not in her palace as she had expected, but in the
home, almost in the arms, of her enemy. When she again spurns his love
he chokes her, and buries her. Then he goes to court and lodges against
Charu a charge of murdering Vasanta for her jewels.</p>
<p>Act IX describes the trial, in which Maitreya unwittingly betrays his
mas- ter by letting Vasant a’s jewels fall from his pocket. Charu is
condemned to death. In Act X Charu is seen on his way to execution. His
child pleads with the executioners to be allowed to take his place, but
they refuse. At the</p>

<p>Since time is more plentiful in the East, where nearly all work is
done by human hands, than in the West, where there are so many
labor-saving devices, Hindu plays are twice as long as the European
dramas of our day. The acts vary from five to ten, and each act is
unobtrusively divided into scenes by the exit of one character and the
entrance of another. There are no unities of time or place, and no
limits to imagination. Scenery is scanty, but costumes are colorful.
Sometimes living animals enliven the play , 61 and for a moment redeem
the artificial with the natural. The per- formance begins with a
prologue, in which an actor or the manager dis- cusses the play; Goethe
seems to have taken from Kalidasa the idea of a prologue for Faust. The
prologue concludes by introducing the first</p>
<p>character, who marches into the middle of things. Coincidences are
in- numerable, and supernatural influences often determine the course of
events. A love-story is indispensable; so is a jester. There is no
tragedy in the Indian theatre; happy endings are unavoidable; faithful
love must always triumph, virtue must always be rewarded, if only to
balance</p>
<p>reality. Philosophical discourse, which obtrudes so often into
Hindu</p>
<p>poetry, is excluded from Hindu drama; drama, like life, must teach
only by action, never by words.* Lyric poetry alternates with prose
accord- ing to the dignity of the topic, the character, and the action.
Sanskrit is spoken by the upper castes in the play, Prakrit by the women
and the lower castes. Descriptive passages excel, character delineation
is poor. The actors — who include women — do their work well, with no
Occidental haste, and with no Far-Eastern fustian. The play ends with an
epilogue, in which the favorite god of the author or the locality is
importuned to bring prosperity to India.</p>
<p>Ever since Sir William Jones translated it and Goethe praised it,
the</p>
<p>most famous of Hindu dramas has been the Shakuntala of Kalidasa.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we know Kalidasa only through three plays, and

him, for he has averted his face from what is delight- ful.”“</li>

<p>the legends that pious memory has hung upon his name. Apparently he
was one of the “Nine Gems”— poets, artists and philosophers — who were
cherished by King Vikramaditya (380-413 a.d.) in the Gupta capital at
Ujjain.</p>
<p>Shakuntala is in seven acts, written partly in prose, partly in vivid
verse. After a prologue in which the manager invites the audience to
consider the beauties of nature, the play opens upon a forest glade in
which a hermit dwells with his foster daughter Shakuntala. The peace of
the scene is dis- turbed by the noise of a chariot; its occupant, King
Dushyanta, appears, and falls in love with Shakuntala with literary
speed. He marries her in the first act, but is suddenly called back to
his capital; he leaves her with the usual promises to return at his
earliest convenience. An ascetic tells the sorrowing girl that the King
will remember her as long as she keeps the ring Dushyanta has given her;
but she loses the ring while bathing. About to become a mother, she
journeys to the court, only to discover that the King has for- gotten
her after the manner of men to whom women have been generous. She tries
to refresh his memory.</p>

<p>That a lotus had collected in its cup</p>
<p>Into the hollow of your hand?</p>

<p>I am listening.</p>
<p>Shakuntala. Just then my adopted child,</p>
<p>The little fawn, ran up with long, soft eyes,</p>
<p>And you, before you quenched your own thirst, gave</p>
<p>To the little creature, saying, “Drink you first,</p>
<p>Gentle fawn!” But she would not from strange hands.</p>
<p>And yet, immediately after, when</p>

<p>576 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXShakuntala, spurned and despondent, is miraculously lifted into the
air and carried off to another forest, where she bears her child — that
great Bharata whose progeny must fight all the battles of the
Mahabharata. Meanwhile a fisherman has found the ring, and seeing the
King’s seal on it, has brought it to Dushyanta. His memory of Shakuntala
is restored, and he seeks her everywhere. Traveling in his airplane over
the Himalayas, he alights by dramatic providence at the very hermitage
where Shakuntala is pining away. He sees the boy Bharata playing before
the cottage, and envies his parents:</p>
<p>“Ah, happy father, happy mother, who,</p>
<p>Carrying their little son, are soiled with dust</p>
<p>Rubbed from his body; it nestles with fond faith</p>
<p>Into their lap, the refuge that he craves —</p>
<p>The white buds of his teeth just visible</p>
<p>When he breaks out into a causeless smile,</p>
<p>And he attempts sweet wordless sounds, . . .</p>
<p>Melting the heart more than any word .” 64</p>
<p>Shakuntala appears, the King begs her forgiveness, receives it, and
makes her his queen. The play ends with a strange but typical
invocation:</p>
<p>“May kings reign only for their subjects’ weal!</p>
<p>May the divine Sarasvati, the source</p>
<p>Of speech, and goddess of dramatic art,</p>
<p>Be ever honored by the great and wise!</p>
<p>And may the purple, self-existent god,</p>
<p>Whose vital energy pervades all space,</p>
<p>From future transmigrations save my soul !” 65</p>
<p>Drama did not decline after Kalidasa, but it did not again pro-</p>
<p>duce a Shakuntala or a Clay Cart . King Harsha, if we may believe
a</p>
<p>possibly inspired tradition, wrote three plays, which held the stage
for centuries. A hundred years after him Bhavabhuti, a Brahman of Berar,
wrote three romantic dramas which are ranked second only to Kalidasa’s
in the history of the Indian stage. His style, however, was so elaborate
and obscure that he had to be — and of course protested that he was —
content with a narrow audience. “How little do they know,” he wrote,
“who speak of us with censure. The entertainment is not for them.</p>
<p>Possibly some one exists or will exist, of similar tastes with
myself; for time is boundless, and the world is wide .” 66</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA 577</p>
<p>We cannot rank the dramatic literature of India on a plane with that
of Greece or Elizabethan England; but it compares favorably with the
theatre of China or Japan. Nor need we look to India for the sophistica-
tion that marks the modern stage; that is an accident of time rather
than an eternal verity, and may pass away — even into its opposite. The
super- natural agencies of Indian drama are as alien to our taste as the
deus ex machina of the enlightened Euripides; but this, too, is a
fashion of history. The weaknesses of Hindu drama (if they may be listed
diffidently by an alien) are artificial diction disfigured with
alliteration and verbal conceits, monochromatic characterization in
which each person is thoroughly good or thoroughly bad, improbable plots
turning upon unbelievable coinci- dences, and an excess of description
and discourse over that action which is, almost by definition, the
specific medium by which drama conveys significance. Its virtues are its
creative fancy, its tender sentiment, its sensitive poetry, and its
sympathetic evocation of nature’s beauty and terror. About national
types of art there can be no disputation; we can judge them only from
the provincial standpoint of our own, and mostly through the prism of
translation. It is enough that Goethe, ablest of all Europeans to
transcend provincial and national barriers, found the reading of
Shakuntala among the profound experiences of his life, and wrote of it
gratefully:</p>
<p>Wouldst thou the young year’s blossoms, and the fruits of its
decline,</p>
<p>And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed;</p>
<p>Wouldst thou the Earth and Heaven itself in one sole name com-</p>
<p>bine?</p>
<p>I name thee, O Shakuntala! and all at once is said.”</p>
<p>V. PROSE AND POETRY</p>
<p>Their unity in India — Fables — History — Tales — Minor poets — Rise
of the vernacular literature — Chandi Das — Tulsi Das —</p>
<p>Poets of the south — Kabir</p>
<p>Prose is largely a recent phenomenon in Indian literature, and might
be termed an exotic corruption through contact with Europeans. To the
naturally poetic soul of the Hindu everything worth writing about had a
poetic content, and invited a poetic form. Since he felt that literature
should be read aloud, and knew that his work would spread and
endure,</p>
<p>578 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXif at all, by oral rather than written dissemination, he chose to
give to his compositions a metric or aphoristic form that would lend
itself to recita- tion and memory. Consequently nearly all the
literature of India is verse: scientific, medical, legal and art
treatises are, more often than not, pre- sented in metre or rhyme or
both; even grammars and dictionaries have been turned into poetry.
Fables and history, which in the West are con- tent with prose, found in
India a melodious poetic form.</p>
<p>Hindu literature is especially rich in fables; indeed, India is
probably responsible for most of the fables that have passed like an
international currency across the frontiers of the world.* Buddhism
flourished best in the days when the Jataka legends of Buddha’s birth
and youth were popular among the people. The best-known book in India is
the Punch at antra , or “Five Headings” (ca. 500 a.d.); it is the source
of many of the fables that</p>
<p>Historical literature did not succeed in rising above the level of
either bare chronicles or gorgeous romance. Perhaps through a scorn of
the Maya events of space and time, perhaps through a preference of oral
to written traditions, the Hindus neglected to compose works of history
that could bear comparison with Herodotus or Thucydides, Plutarch or
Tacitus, Gibbon or Voltaire. Details of place and date were so scantily
recorded, even in the case of famous men, that Hindu scholars assigned
to their greatest poet, Kalidasa, dates ranging over a millennium. 60
Living to our own time in an almost unchanging world of custom, morals
and beliefs, the Hindu hardly dreamed of progress, and never bothered
about antiquities. He was content</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sir William Jones reported that the Hindus laid claim to three
inventions: chess, the decimal system, and teaching by fables.</p></li>
<li><p>A lively war rages in the fields of Oriental scholarship as to
whether these fables passed from India to Europe, or turn about; we
leave the dispute to men of leisure. Per- haps they passed to both India
and Europe from Egypt, via Mesopotamia and Crete. The influence of the
Panchatantra upon the Arabian Nights , however, is beyond question .

</ul>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA 579</p>
<p>to accept the epics as authentic history, and to let legend serve for
biog- raphy. When Ashvaghosha wrote his life of Buddha (the
Buddha-charita ), it was legend rather than history; and when, five
hundred years later, Bana wrote his Harsha-charita , it was again an
idealization rather than a reliable portrait of the great king. The
native chronicles of Rajputana appear to be exercises in patriotism.
Only one Hindu writer seems to have grasped the function of the
historian. Kalhana, author of the Rajatarangini , or “Stream</p>
<p>The Moslems were more acutely conscious of history, and left some ad-
mirable prose records of their doings in India. We have mentioned
Alberuni’s ethnographica l study of India, and Babur’s Memoirs.
Contemporary with Akbar was an excellent historian, Muhammad Qazim
Firishta, whose His- tory of India is our most reliable guide to the
events of the Moslem period. Less impartial was Akbar ’s prime minister
or gen eral political factotum, Abu -1 Fazl, who put his master’s
administrative methods down for posterity in the Ain- i Akbari , or
“Institutes of Akbar,” and told his master’s life with for - givable
fondness in the Akbar Nama. The Emperor returned his affection; and when
the news came that Jehangir had slain the vizier, Akbar burst into
passionate grief, and cried out: “If Salim (Jehangir) wished to be
emperor, he might have slain me and spared Abu - 1 Fazl.” 61</p>
<p>Midway between fables and history were the vast collections of poetic
tales put together by industrious versifiers for the delectation of the
roman- tic Indian soul. As far back as the first century a.d. one
Gunadhya wrote in one hundred thousand couplets the Brihatkatha , or
“Great Romance”; an d a thousand years later Somadeva composed the
Kathasaritzagara , or “Ocean of the Rivers of Story,” a torrent 21,500
couplets long. In the same eleventh century a clever story-teller of
uncertain identity built a framework for his V etalapanchavimchat ika
(“The Twenty - five Stories of the Vampire”) by representing King
Vikramaditya as receiving annually from an ascetic a fruit containing a
precious stone. The King inquires how he may prove his gratitude; he is
asked to bring to the yogi the corpse of a man hanging on the gallows,
but is warned not to speak if the corpse should address him. The corpse
is inhabited by a vampire who, as the King stumbles along, fas- cinates
him with a story; at the end of the story the vampire propounds a
question which the King, forgetting his instructions, answers.
Twenty-five times the King attempts the task of bringing a corpse to the
ascetic and holding his peace; twenty-four times he is so absorbed in
the story that the</p>
<p>580 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXvampire tells him that he answers the question put to him at the
end. 62 It was an excellent scaffold on which to hang a score of
tales.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was no dearth of poets writing what we should call
poetry. Abu- 1 Fazl describes “thousands of poets” at Akbar’s court;
there were hundreds at minor capitals, and doubtless dozens in every
home.* One of the earliest and greatest was Bhartrihari, monk,
grammarian and lover, who, before retiring into the arms of religion,
instructed his soul with amours. He has left us a record of them in his
“Century of Love”— a Heine- like sequence of a hundred poems.
“Erstwhile,” he writes to one of his loves, “we twain deemed that thou
wast I and I was thou; how comes it now that thou are thou and I am I?”
He did not care for reviewers, and told them: “It is easy to satisfy one
who is ignorant, even easier to satisfy a connoisseur; but not the
Creator himself can please the man who has just a morsel of knowledge.”
63 In Jayadeva’s Gita - Govinda , or “Song of the Divine Cowherd,” the
amorousness of the Hindu turns to religion, and in - tones the sensuous
love of Radha and Krishna. It is a poem of full-bodied passion, but
India interprets it reverently as a mystic and symbolic por- trayal of
the soul’s lon ging for God — an interpretation that would be intelligi-
ble to those immovable divines who composed such pious headings for the
Song of Songs .</p>
<p>In the eleventh century the vernaculars made inroads upon the
classical dead language as a medium of literary expression, as they were
to do in Europe a century later. The first major poet to use the living
speech of the people was Chand Bardai, who wrote in Hindi an immense
historical poem of sixty cantos, and was only persuaded to interrupt his
work by the call of death. Sur Das, the blind poet of Agra, composed
60,000 verses on the life and adventures of Krishna; we are told that he
was helped by the god himself, who became his amanuensis, and wrote
faster than the poet could dictate. 0 * Meanwhile a poor priest, Chandi
Das, was shocking Bengal by composing Dantean songs to a peasant
Beatrice, ideal- izing her with romantic passion, exalting her as a
symbol of divinity, and</p>
<ul>
<li>Poetry tended now to be less objective than in the days of the epic,
and gave itself more and more to the interweaving of religion and love.
Metre, which had been loose and free in the epics, varying in the length
of the line, and requiring regularity only in the last four or five
syllables, became at once stricter and more varied; a thousand com-
plications of prosody were introduced, which disappear in translation;
artifices of letter and phrase abounded, and rhyme appeared not only at
the end but often in the middle of the line. Rigid rules were composed
for the poetic art, and the form became more pre- cise as the content
thinned.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE LITERATURE OF INDIA 58 1</p>
<p>making his love an allegory of his desire for absorption in God; at
the same time he inaugurated the use of Bengali as a literary language.
“I h ave taken refuge at your feet, my beloved. When I do not see you my
mind has no rest …. I cannot forget your grace and your charm, — and yet
there is no desire in my heart.” Excommunicated by his fellow Brahmans
on the ground that he was scandalizing the public, he agreed to renounce
his love, Rami, in a public ceremony of recantation; but when, in the
course of this ritual, he saw Rami in the crowd, he withdrew his
recanta- tion, and going up to her, bowed before her with hands joined
in adora- tion.^</p>
<p>The supreme poet of Hindi literature is Tulsi Das, almost a
contem-</p>
<p>porary of Shakespeare. His parents exposed him because he had been
born under an unlucky star. He was adopted by a forest mystic, who
instructed him in the legendary lore of Rama. He married; but when his
son died, Tulsi Das retired to the woods to lead a life of penance and
medi- tation. There, and in Benares, he wrote his religious epic, the
Rama- charita- manasa, or “Lake of the Deeds of Rama,” in which he told
again the story of Rama, and offered him to India as the supreme and
only god. “There is one God,” says Tulsi Das; “it is Rama, creator of
heaven and earth, and redeemer of mankind. … For the sake of his
faithful people a very god, Lord Rama, became incarnate as a king, and
for our sanctifica- tion lived, as it were, the life of any ordinary
man.” 00 Few Europeans have been able to read the work in the now
archaic Hindi original; one of these considers that it establishes Tulsi
Das as “the most important figure in the whole of Indian literature.” 00
To the natives of Hindustan the poem constitutes a popular Bible of
theology and ethics. “I regard the Ramayana of Tulsi Das,” says Gandhi,
“as the greatest book in all devotional literature.” 07</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Deccan was also producing poetry. Tukaram composed in
the Mahrathi tongue 4600 religious songs which are as current in India
today as the Psalms of “David” are in Judaism or Christendom. His first
wife having died, he married a shrew and became a philoso pher. “It is
not hard to win salvation,” he wrote, “for it may readily be found in
the bundle on our back.” 08 As early as the second century a.d. Madura
became</p>
<p>582 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXdifficult of Tamil meters a religious and philosophical work — the
Kurral — expounding moral and political ideals. Tradition assures us
that when the members of the Sangam , who were all Brahmans, saw the
success of this Pariah’s poetry, they drowned themselves to a man ; 70
but this is not to be believed of any Academy.</p>
<p>We have kept for the last, though out of his chronological place, the
greatest lyric poet of medieval India. Kabir, a simple weaver of
Benares, prepared for his task of uniting Islam and Hinduism by having,
we are told, a Mohammedan for his father and a Brahman virgin for his
mother . 71 Fascinated by the preacher Ramananda, he became a devotee of
Rama, en- larged him (as Tulsi Das would also do) into a universal
deity, and began to write Hindi poems of rare beauty to explain a creed
in which there should be no temples, no mosques, no idols, no caste, no
circumcision, and but one god.* “Kabir,” he says,</p>
<p>is a child of Ram and Allah, and accepteth all Gurus and Firs. . .
.</p>
<p>O God, whether Allah or Rama, I live by thy name. . . . Lifeless</p>
<p>are all the images of the gods; they cannot speak; I know it, for
I</p>
<p>have called aloud to them. . . . What avails it to wash your
mouth,</p>
<p>count your beads, bathe in holy streams, and bow in temples, if,</p>
<p>whilst you mutter your prayers or go on pilgrimages,
deceitfulness</p>
<p>is in your hearts ? 73</p>
<p>The Brahmans were shocked, and to refute him (the story runs) sent a
courtesan to tempt him; but he converted her to his creed. This was
easy, for he had no dogmas, but only profound religious feeling.</p>
<p>There is an endless world, O my brother,</p>
<p>And there is a nameless Being, of whom naught can be said;</p>
<p>Only he knows who has reached that region.</p>
<p>It is other than all that is heard or said.</p>
<p>No form, no body, no length, no breadth is seen there;</p>
<p>How can I tell you that which it is?</p>
<p>Kabir says: “It cannot be told by the words of the mouth, it can
-</p>
<p>not be written on paper;</p>
<p>It is like a dumb person who tastes a sweet thjng — how shall it
be</p>
<p>explained ? 73</p>

<p>He accepted the theory of reincarnation which was in the air
about</p>
<p>him, and prayed, like a Hindu, to be released from the chain of
re-</p>
<p>birth and redeath. But his ethic was the simplest in the world: live
justly, and look for happiness at your elbow.</p>
<p>I laugh when I hear that the fish in the water is thirsty;</p>
<p>You do not see that the Real is in your home, and you wander from</p>
<p>forest to forest listlessly!</p>
<p>Here is the truth! Go where you will, to Benares or to Mathura,</p>
<p>if you do not find your soul, the world is unreal to you. . . .</p>
<p>To what shore would you cross, O my heart? There is no traveler</p>
<p>before you, there is no road. . . .</p>
<p>There there is neither body nor mind; and where is the place that</p>
<p>shall still the thirst of the soul? You shall find naught in the</p>
<p>emptiness.</p>
<p>Be strong, and enter into your own body; for there your foothold</p>
<p>is firm. Consider it well, O my heart! Go not elsewhere.</p>
<p>Kabir says: Put all imaginations away, and stand fast in that
which</p>
<p>you are.”</p>
<p>After his death, runs the legend, Hindus and Mohammedans contended
for his body, and disputed whether it should be buried or burned. But
while they disputed some one raised the cloth that covered the corpse,
and nothing could be seen but a mass of flowers. The Hindus burned a
part of the flowers in Benares, and the Moslems buried the rest.’ 5
After his death his songs passed from mouth to mouth among the people;
Nanak the Sikh was inspired by them to found his sturdy sect; others
made the poor weaver into a deity.” Today two small sects, jealously
separate, follow the doctrine and worship the name of this poet who
tried to unite Moslems and Hindus. One sect is Hindu, the other is
Moslem.</p>
