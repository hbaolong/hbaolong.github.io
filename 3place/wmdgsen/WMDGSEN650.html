<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XThe Glorious Revolution</p>
<p>1685-1714</p>
<p>I. THE CATHOLIC KING: 1 685-88</p>
<p>W HO would have fancied, from Vandyck’s beautiful blue -and-gold</p>
<p>portrait 1 of the Duke of York at the age of two, that this
innocent,</p>
<p>sensitive, diffident child would ruin the Stuart dynasty and finally
com- plete, in the “Glorious Revolution,” that transfer of power from
king to Parliament which his father had ingloriously begun? But in
Riley’s por - trait 2 of the same soul as James II the diffidence has
become bewilderment, the sensitivity has changed into obstinacy, and the
innocence has passed through compliant mistresses to an inflexible
theology. That character de- termined a tragic fate in which, as in all
great tragedies, every participant fought for what seemed to him right,
and can claim a portion of our sympathy.</p>
<p>We have already noted some of his virtues. He repeatedly exposed him-
self to danger of death in his naval career. Men compared him favorably
with his brother in administrative industry, in modesty of expenditure,
in fidelity to his word. He observed Charles’s dying injunction to take
care</p>
<p>His faults grew with his power. Proud and arrogant even before
his</p>
<p>accession, scornful of the many and accessible only to a few, he
adopted *0 the letter his father’s theory that the king should have
absolute authority;</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>CHAP. X) THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION 289</p>
<p>and he had not his brother’s realistic humor to see its practical
limitations. We must pay respect to his fervor for his religion, and his
desire to give his fellow Catholics in England freedom of worship and
equality of po- litical opportunity. He had been devoted to his Catholic
mother and sister; he had, for the past fifteen years, been surrounded
by Catholics in his own house; and he thought it strange that a religion
that produced so many good men and women should be so checked and hated
by Englishmen. He did not share the vivid memories that English
Protestants transmitted of the Gunpowder Plot, or their fear that a
Catholic ruler would be in- clined, and be sooner or later persuaded, to
adopt only such policies as would not displease an Italian pope.
Protestant England felt that its re- ligious, intellectual, and
political independence would be imperiled by a Catholic king.</p>
<p>James’s first moves after his accession slightly relieved these
fears. He</p>
<p>His first pro-Catholic measure carried no direct offense to
Protestantism. He ordered the release of all persons imprisoned for
refusal to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. Thousands of
Catholics were thereby freed, but also twelve hundred Quakers and many
other Dissenters. He forbade any further prosecutions in matters of
religion. He liberated Danby, and the Catholic lords who had been sent
to the Tower on charges by Titus Oates. In a new trial Oates was
convicted of perjuries that had led to the execution of several innocent
persons; the court, expressing re- gret that it could not condemn him to
death, sentenced him to pay a fine of two thousand marks, to be tied to
the back of a cart, to be twice publicly whipped — once from Aldgate to
Newgate, and two days later from New- gate to Tyburn — and to stand in
the pillory five times every year for the remainder of his life. He
survived the ordeal, and was returned to jail (May,</p>
<p>1685). James, asked to remit the second whipping, refused.</p>
<p>The precarious truce of the faiths was broken by a double revolt.
In</p>
<p>May Archibald Campbell, ninth Earl of Argyll, landed in Scotland, and
in June James, Duke of Monmouth, landed on the southwest coast of
England, in a joint effort to overthrow the Catholic King. Monmouth’s
proclamation denounced James as a usurper, tyrant, and murderer, charged
him with the burning of London, the Popish Plot, and the poisoning
of</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>THE AGE OP LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XCharles, and pledged the invaders to make no peace until they had
rescued the Protestant religion and the liberties of the nation and the
Parliament. Argyll was overcome on June 17, and executed on June 30; the
northern arm of the rebellion failed. But the people of Dorsetshire,
strongly Puritan, hailed Monmouth as a savior, and so many men enlisted
under his banner that he confidently and solemnly assumed the title of
James II, King of England. The nobility and the moneyed classes offered
him no support, and his undisciplined army was defeated by the royal
forces at Sedgemoor (July 6, 1685) — the last battle fought on English
soil before the Second World War. Monmouth fled, begged forgiveness of
the King, was re- fused, and was beheaded.</p>
<p>The royal army, led by Colonel Percy Kirke, pursued the remainder of
the rebels and hanged prisoners without trial. James appointed a com-
mission, headed by Chief Justice Jeffreys, to go into the west country
and try persons accused of joining or abetting the revolt. Jury trials
were given them, but the juries were so terrorized by Jeffreys that very
few of the accused found mercy in these “Bloody Assizes” (September,
1685).* Nearly four hundred were hanged, and eight hundred were
condemned to forced labor in the plantations of the West Indies. 7
Elizabeth in 1 569 and Cromwell in 1648 had been guilty of similar
barbarities, but Jeffreys outdid them by browbeating witnesses and
juries, cursing his victims, gloating over them, and giving guilt the
benefit of every doubt except when a substantial bribe argued for
innocence. 8 James made some modest efforts to check the brutality, but
when the holocaust was over he raised Jeffreys to the peerage and made
him lord chancellor (September 6, 1686).</p>
<p>This vengeful pursuit shared in alienating the country from the King.
When he asked Parliament for repeal of the Test Act (excluding Catholics
from office and Parliament), for modification of the Habeas Corpus Act,
and for a standing army under royal command, it refused to comply. James
prorogued it (November 20), and proceeded to appoint Catholics to
office. When Halifax objected to this flouting of Parliament James dis-
missed him from the Council, and replaced him, as its lord president,
with Sunderland, who presently announced his conversion to Catholicism
(1687). When James commended Louis XIV’s R evocation of the Edict of
Nantes, 9 England concluded that if James had power as absolute as that
of the Bourbon, he would take similar measures against English
Protestants. James made no concealment of his belief that his power was
already abso- lute, and that Louis XIV was his ideal of a king. For a
time he accepted subsidies from Louis, but he refused to let him dictate
the policies of the English government, and the subsidies ended.</p>
<p>The assizes were the periodical sittings of the superior courts in
each county.</p>
<p>CHAP. x)</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>Louis was wiser about England than about his own country; while he
weakened France by his persecution of the Huguenots, he cautioned James
against haste in Catholicizing England. Pope Innocent XI gave him
similar counsel. When James sent word to him promising England’s early
submission to the Roman Church, 10 he advised the King to content him-
self with obtaining toleration for English Catholics; he warned these to
abstain from political ambitions, and directed the general of the
Jesuits to rebuke Father Petre for taking so prominent a part in the
government. 11 Innocent had not abated his Catholic zeal, but he feared
the encompassing strength of Louis XIV, and hoped that England could be
turned from a servant of French designs to be a makeweight against them.
The Pope sent a nuncio to England — the first since Mary Tudor’s reign —
to make clear to James that a rupture between Parliament and the King
would be in- jurious to the interests of the Roman Church. 12</p>
<p>James did not profit from this advice. He felt that, being fifty-two
years old at his accession, he had not much time left to effect the
religious changes that were dear to his heart. He had little hope of a
son; a Protestant daughter would succeed him, and would overturn his
work unless this should be solidly established before his death. Father
Petre and the Queen overruled all counsels of deliberation. The King not
only went in royal state to</p>
<p>hear Mass, but he asked his councilors to attend him there. Priests
in growing number moved about the court. He appointed Catholics to mili-
tary posts, and persuaded the judges (who were appointed and removable
by him) to confirm his right to dispense such appointees from the
penalties imposed upon them by the Test Act. He built up, largely under
such</p>
<p>Catholic officers, an army of thirteen thousand men, subject only to
his orders, and obviously threatening the independence of Parliament. He
suspended the penalties attached by law to public attendance at Catholic
worship. He issued a decree (June, 1686) forbidding clergymen to preach
sermons of doctrinal controversy; and when Dr. John Sharp preached on
the motives of converts, James, as legal head of the English Church,
ordered Henry Compton, bishop of London, to suspend him from the
Anglican „ ministry. Compton refused. James, overriding a law of 1673,
appointed a new Ecclesiastical Commission Court, dominated by Sunderland
and Jeffreys; it tried Compton for disobedience to the Crown, and
removed him from office. The Anglican Church, which had preached
absolute obedience, began to turn against the King.</p>
<p>He had hoped to win the Anglican Church to reconciliation with Rome,
but his precipitate action now excluded that policy; instead, he took up
the plan of uniting the Catholics and Dissenters against the
Establishment. William Penn, who had found his way into the King’s
confidence, advised him that he could bring to his ardent support all
the English Protestants</p>
<p>292 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xbut the Anglicans if he should, by a few strokes of the pen, annul
all laws forbidding the public worship of the Dissenting sects. On
August 4, 1687, James issued his first Declaration of Indulgence.
Whatever were his mo- tives, the document holds a place in the history
of toleration. It suspended all penal laws affecting religion, abrogated
all religious tests, allowed free- dom of worship to all, and forbade
interference with peaceable religious assemblies. It released all
persons who were imprisoned for religious non- conformity. It went
beyond the similar declarations of Charles II, which had kept religious
tests for office, and had allowed Catholic worship only in private
homes. It assured the Established Church that the King would continue to
protect it in all its legal rights. It was a pity that this measure had
to be an implicit declaration of war against Parliament, which had
decreed all the disabilities now annulled. If Parliament were to admit
the authority of the King to cancel parliamentary legislation, the Civil
War would have to be fought once more.</p>
<p>Halifax, who was at this time the most brilliant mind in England, en-
tered the fray with an anonymous Letter to a Dissenter (August, 1687) —
“the most successful pamphlet of the age.” 13 He urged Protestants to
realize that the toleration now offered them came from a prince loyal to
a Church that claimed infallibility and frankly repudiated toleration.
Could there be any lasting harmony between liberty of conscience and an
infallible Church? How could Dissenters trust their new friends, who
till yesterday had branded them as heretics? “The other day you were
sons of Belial, n ow you are angels of light.” 14 Unfortunately, the
Anglican Church had agreed with Rome about the sons of Belial, and had
in the last twenty- seven years subjected Dissenters to such persecution
as might well have excused them from accepting freedom even at Catholic
hands. The Angli- can hierarchy made haste to seek peace with the
Presbyterians, Puritans, and Quakers. It begged them to reject the
present indulgence, and promised them soon a toleration that would have
the sanction of both the Parliament and the Established Church. Some
Dissenters sent letters of gratitude to the King; the majority stood
aloof; and when the day of decision came, they rejected the King.</p>
<p>James proceeded. The universities of England, for many years past,
had required of teachers and students submission to the Anglican Church.
Exceptions had been made in conferring a degree upon a Lutheran candi-
date, and an honorary degree upon a Mohammedan diplomat; but the
Anglican clergy thought of Oxford and Cambridge as institutions whose
chief function was to prepare men for the Anglican ministry, and it was
resolved that no Catholic should be admitted. To breach this barrier
James sent a mandatory letter to the vice-chancellor at Cambridge,
directing him to exempt from the Anglican oath a Benedictine monk who
sought the</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>master’s degree. The vice -chancellor refused; he was suspended by
order of the Ecclesiastical Commission; the university sent a
delegation, including Isaac Newton, to explain its position to the King;
the monk quieted the situation by withdrawing (1687). In the same year
the King recommended for the presidency of Magdalen College, Oxford, a
man of indifferent learning but of Catholic leaning; the fellows refused
to elect him. After a long dispute James suggested a less objectionable
candidate, the Anglican Bishop Parker of Oxford. The electoral fellows
rejected him; they were expelled by order of the King, and Bishop Parker
was installed by force.</p>
<p>Resentment rose as James entrusted himself more and more to Catholic
advisers. His admiration for Father Petre was so great that he
importuned the Pope to make him a bishop, even a cardinal; Innocent
refused. In July, 1687, James made the able but reckless Jesuit a member
of the Privy Council. Many English Catholics protested that this was a
foolish measure, but James was in haste to fight the issues out to a
conclusion. There were now six Catholics in the Council, and the favor
of the King made them predominant. 15 In 1688 four Catholic bishops were
appointed to govern the Catholic Church in England; James settled upon
each of them an annual pension of a thousand pounds; in effect Catholics
now shared with the Anglicans the position of a state-supported
church.</p>
<p>On April 25, 1688, James republished his year-old Declaration of
In-</p>
<p>dulgence, and added to it a reaffirmation of his resolve to secure to
all Englishmen “freedom of conscience forever.” Henceforth promotion to
and in office was to depend upon merit regardless of creed. The
reduction of religious hostility, he predicted, would open new markets
to English trade, and would add to the prosperity of the nation. He
begged his subjects to lay aside all animosity, and elect the next
Parliament without any dis- tinctions of religious faith. To ensure the
widest circulation of this en- larged Declaration his Council sent
instructions to all bishops to arrange with their clergy that it should
be read in every parish church in England on May 20 or 27. Such use of
the clergy as a means of communicating with the people had several
precedents, but none in which the message was so distasteful to the
Established Church. On May 18 seven Anglican bishops presented to the
King a petition explaining that they could not in con- science recommend
to their clergy the reading of the Declaration, for it violated the
edict of Parliament that parliamentary legislation could be suspended
only by Parliament’s consent. James answered that their own theologians
had persistently preached the necessity of obedience to the King as the
head of their Church, and that there was nothing in the Decla- ration
offensive to any conscience. He promised to consider their petition; but
if they did not hear from him on the morrow, they were to obey the
order.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XThe next morning thousands of copies of the petition were sold in
the streets of London, while it was still under royal consideration.
James felt that this was contrary to all protocol. He submitted the
petition to the twelve judges of the royal court; they advised him that
he had acted within his legal rights. He left the petition unanswered.
On May 20 the petition was read in four London churches; it was ignored
in the remaining ninety-six. The King felt that his authority had been
flouted. He ordered the seven bishops to appear before the Council. When
they came he told them that they would have to submit to trial on the
charge of having published a seditious libel; however, to spare them
imprisonment in the meantime, he would accept their written promise to
appear when sum- moned. They replied that as peers of the realm they
need not give any other security than their word. The Council committed
them to the Tower. As they were rowed down the Thames they were cheered
by people on the banks.</p>
<p>On June 29 and 30 the bishops were tried before the Court of King’s
Bench — four judges and a jury. After two days of heated argument, in a
hall surrounded by ten thousand excited Londoners, the jury returned a
verdict of not guilty. All Protestant England rejoiced; “Never
within</p>
<p>man’s memory,” said a Catholic peer, “hav e there been such shouts
and such tears of joy as today.” 16 The streets blazed with bonfires;
crowds paraded behind wax figures of the Pope, the cardinals, and the
Jesuits, which were burned amid wild celebrations. To the simple people
the verdict meant that Catholicism was not to be tolerated; to more
complex minds it meant that the privilege of Parliament to rtiake laws
irrevocable by the king had been vindicated, and that England was in
fact, even if not in theory, a constitutional, not an absolute,
monarchy.</p>
<p>James, brooding in defeat, consoled himself with the infant to which
the Queen had given birth on June 10, a month before her expected time.
He would bring up this precious boy as a loyal and devoted Catholic. Day
by day father and son, over every opposition and discouragement, would
move a step nearer to the sacred goal — the old monarchy living in
concord with the old Church, in an England pacified and reconciled, in a
Europe repenting its apostasy, and united again in the one true, holy,
uni- versal faith.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>DEPOSUIT POTENTES DE SEDE</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps it was that premature birth that brought disaster to the pre-
cipitate King. Protestant England agreed with James that this boy might
continue the effort to restore Catholicism; it feared him for the
same</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>reason that the King loved him. It denied, at first, that this was
the King’s son; it accused the Jesuits of having brought in some
purchased infant to the Queen’s bed as part of a plot to keep the King’s
Protestant daughter Mary from inheriting the throne. It turned more and
more to Mary as the hope of English Protestantism, and reconciled itself
to another revolu- tion to make her queen.</p>
<p>But Mary was now the wife of William III of Orange, Stadholder of</p>
<p>the United Provinces; what would proud William say to being merely
the consort of a queen? Why not offer him co-ordinate rule with Mary?
After all, he too had royal English blood; his mother had been another
Mary, daughter of Charles I. In any case William had no intention of
playing consort to his wife. It was probably at his suggestion 17 that
Bishop Burnet, who had exiled himself to the Continent on the accession
of James, persuaded Mary to p ledge her full obedience to William “in
all things,” whatever authority might devolve upon her. “The rule and
authority should be his,” she agreed, “for she only desired that he
would obey the command of ‘Husbands, love your wives,’ as she should do
that of ‘Wives, be obedient to your husbands in all things.’” 18 William
accepted the obedi - ence, but ignored the gentle allusion to his
liaison with Mrs. Villiers, his mistress. 19 After all, Protestant
rulers too should be allowed to adulterate their marriages.</p>
<p>William, fighting Louis XIV for the preservation of Dutch
independence and Protestantism, had hoped for a time to win his
father-in-law to an alliance against a French King who was destroying
the balance and</p>
<p>liberties of Europe. When this hope faded, he had negotiated with
those Englishmen who led the opposition to James. He had connived at the
organization, on Dutch soil, of Monmouth’s expedition against the King,
and had allowed it to depart unhindered from a Dutch port. 20 He had
reason to fear that James planned to disqualify him as a successor to
the throne; and when a son was bom to the King, the rights of Mary were
obviously superseded. Early in 1687 William sent Everhard van Dykvelt to
England to establish friendly contacts with Protestant leaders. The
envoy returned with favorable letters from the Marquis of Halifax, the
Earls of Shrewsbury, Bedford, Clarendon (son of the former Chancellor),
Danby, Bishop Compton, and others. The letters were too vague to consti-
tute clear treason, but they implied warm support for William as a con-
tender for the throne.</p>
<p>In June, 1687, Kaspar Fagel, Grand Pensionary, issued a letter
authorita- tively stating William’s views on toleration: the Stadholder
desired free - dom of religious worship for all, but opposed the
abrogation of the Test Act confirming public office to adherents of the
Anglican faith. 21 This cautious pronouncement won him the support of
prominent Anglicans.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XWhen the birth of a son to James apparently ended William’s chances
of succeeding James, the Protestant leaders decided to invite him to
come and conquer the throne. The invitation (June 30, 1688) was signed
by the twelfth Earl of Shrewsbury, the first Duke of Devonshire, the
Earls of Danby and Scarborough, Admiral Edward Russell (cousin of the
William Russell executed in 1683), Henry Sidney (brother of Algernon),
and</p>
<p>Bishop Compton. Halifax did not sign, saying that he preferred
constitu- tional opposition; but many others, including Sunderland and
John</p>
<p>Churchill (both then in the service of James), sent William assurance
of their support. 22 The signers recognized that their invitation was
treason; they deliberately took their lives in their hands, and
dedicated their fortunes to the enterprise. Shrewsbury, a former
Catholic converted to Protestant- ism, mortgaged his estates for forty
thousand pounds, and crossed to Hol- land to help direct the invasion.
23</p>
<p>William could not act at once, for he was not sure of his own people,
and he feared that at any moment Louis XIV would renew his attack upon
Holland. The German states also feared attack by France; neverthe- less
they raised no objection to William’s invasion, for they knew that his
ultimate aim was to check the Bourbon King. The Hapsburg governments of
Austria and Spain forgot their Catholicism in their hatred of Louis XIV,
and approved the deposition of a Catholic ruler friendly to France. Even
the Pope gave the expedition his nihil obstat, so that it was by
permission of Catholic powers that Protestant William undertook to
depose Catholic James. Louis and James themselves precipitated the
invasion. Louis pro- claimed that the bonds of “friendship and alliance”
existing between E ng- land and France would compel him to declare war
upon any invader of England. James, fearing that this statement would
further unify his Protes- tant subjects against him, denied the
existence of such an alliance, and rejected the offer of French help.
Louis let his anger get the better of his strategy. He ordered his
armies to attack not Holland but Germany</p>
<p>(September 25, 1688); and the States-General of the United Provinces,
freed for a time from fear of the French, agreed to let William proceed
on an expedition which might win England to alliance against France. On
October 19 the armada set forth — fifty warships, five hundred trans-
ports, five hundred cavalry, eleven thousand infantry, including many
Huguenot refugees from the French dragonnades. Driven back by winds, the
fleet waited for a “Protestant breeze,” and sailed again on November 1.
An English squadron sent to intercept it was scattered by a storm. On
November 5 — the national holiday commemorating the Gunpowder Plot — the
invaders landed at Torbay, an inlet of the Channel on the Dorsetshire
coast. No resistance was encountered, but no welcome was received; the
people had not forgotten Jeffreys and Kirke. James ordered his army,
under</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>297</p>
<p>command of Lord John Churchill, to assemble at Salisbury, and he
himself joined it there. He found his troops so lukewarm in their
allegiance that he could not trust them to give battle; he ordered a
retreat. That night (November 23) Churchill and two other high officers
of the King’s army deserted to William with four hundred men. 24 A few
days later Prince George of Denmark, husband of James’s d aughter Anne,
joined the spread- ing defection. Returning to London, the unhappy King
found that Anne, with Churchill’s wife, Sarah Jennings, had fled to
Nottingham. The spirit of the once proud monarch broke under the
discovery that both his daugh- ters had turned against him. He
commissioned Halifax to treat with</p>
<p>William. On December 1 1 he himself left his capital. Halifax, back
from the front, found the nation leaderless, but a group of peers made
him president of a provisional government. On the thirteenth they
received a message from James that he was in hostile hands at Faversham
in Kent. They sent troops to rescue him, and on the sixteenth the
humiliated King was back in Whitehall Palace. William, advancing toward
London, sent some Dutch guardsmen with instructions to carry James to
Rochester, and there let him escape. It was done; James fell into the
trap laid for him, and quitted England for France (December 23). He
would survive his fall by thirteen years, but he would never see England
again.</p>
<p>William reached London on December 19. He used his victory with</p>
<p>characteristic firmness, prudence, and moderation. He put an end to
the riots in which London Protestants had been pillaging and burning the
houses of Catholics. At the request of the provisional government he
sum- moned the lords, bishops, and former members of Parliament to meet
at Coventry. The “Convention” that assembled there on February 1, 1689,
declared that James had abdicated the throne by his flight. It offered
to crown Mary as queen and accept William as her regent; they refused.
It offered to crown William as king and Mary as queen; they accepted
(Feb- ruary 13). But the Convention accompanied this offer with a

<p>This historic proclamation expressed the essential results of
what</p>
<p>Protestant England called the “Glorious Revolution”: the explicit
assertion of the legislative supremacy of Parliament, so long contested
by four Stuart kings; the protection of the citizen against arbitrary
governmental power; and the exclusion of Roman Catholics from holding or
sharing the throne of England. Only next to these results in importance
was the consoli- dation of governmental power in the landowning
aristocracy; for the revolution had been initiated by great nobles and
carried through with the landowning gentry as represented in the House
of Commons; in effect, the “absolute” monarchy by “divine right” had
been changed into a terr i-</p>
<p>CHAP. x)</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>torial oligarchy characterized by moderation, assiduity, and skill in
gov- ernment, co-operating with the princes of industry, commerce, and
finance, and generally careless of the artisans and peasantry. The upper
middle classes benefited substantially from the revolution. The cities
of England recovered their freedom to be ruled by mercantile
oligarchies. The mer- chants of London, who had shied away from helping
James, lent £ 200,000 to finance William between his arrival in the
capital and his first reception of parliamentary funds . 26 That loan
cemented an unwritten agreement: the merchants would let the landowners
rule England, but the ruling aristoc- racy would direct foreign policy
to commercial interests, and would leave merchants and manufacturers
increasingly free from official regulation.</p>
<p>There were some inglorious elements in the Glorious Revolution . 27
It seemed regrettable that England had had to call in a Dutch army to
redress English wrongs, that a daughter should help oust her father from
his throne, that the commander of his army should go over to the
invader, and that the national Church should join in overthrowing a King
whose divine arid absolute authority it had sanctified against any act
of rebellion or dis- obedience. It was regrettable that the supremacy of
Parliament had to be vindicated by opposing freedom of worship. But the
evil that these men and women did was interred with their bones; the
good that they accom- plished lived after them and grew. Even in
establishing an oligarchy they laid the foundations of a democracy that
would come with the broadening of the electorate. They made the Eng
lishman’s home his castle, relatively secure against the “insolence of
office” and “the oppressor’s wrong.” They contributed some part to that
admirable reconciliation of order and liberty which is the English
government today. And they did all this without shed- ding a drop of
blood — except the repeated nosebleeds of the harassed, help- less,
deserted, witless King.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">

<p>The new King appointed as his privy councilors Danby as lord

<p>dent, Halifax as lord privy seal, the Earls of Shrewsbury and
Nottingham as secretaries of state, the Earl of Portland as lord of the
privy purse, and Gil- bert Burnet bishop of Salisbury.</p>
<p>The most remarkable and influential of these men was George Savile,
Marquis of Halifax. As a nephew of the Lord Strafford who had been ex-
ecuted by the Long Parliament, he had lost much of his property in the
Great Rebellion, but he had salvaged enough to five comfortably in
France during the Cromwellian regime. There he discovered Mo ntaigne’s
Essays, and became a philosopher; if, later, he graduated from politics
to states-</p>

<p>Xmanship, it was because the difference between politics and
statesmanship is philosophy — the ability to see the moment and the part
in the light of the lasting and the whole. Halifax was never content to
be entirely a man of affairs. “The government of the world,” he wrote,
meaning the rule of nations, “is a great thing; but it is a very coarse
one, too, compared with the fineness of speculative knowledge .” 28
Politics had sometimes to deal with crowds, which frightened Halifax.
“There is an accumulative cruelty in a number of men, though none in
particular are ill-natured . . . The angry buzz of a multitude is one of
the bloodiest noises in the world .” 29 He had</p>
<p>Back in England, he regained his property, and wealth so extensive
that he could afford to be honest. He served Charles II until he learned
of the secret Treaty of Dover. He defended the right of James to succeed
to the throne, but he opposed the repeal of the Test Act. He looked
forward to a Protestant rule after a brief Catholic interval, and
realized his hope when he took a leading part in peacefully transferring
the royal power from James II to William III. He followed his own sense
of right rather than cleave to any party line. “Ignorance,” he wrote in
Thoughts and Reflexions, “maketh most men go into a party, and shame
keepeth them from ge tting out of it .” 31 When he was abused for
breaking party lines he defended him - self in a famous pamphlet on The
Character of a Trimmer :</p>
<p>The innocent word Trimmer signifieth no more than this, That</p>
<p>if men are together in a boat, and one part of the company would</p>

con- ceive it would do as well if the boat were even . 32</p>
<p>He was occasionally unscrupulous, always eloquent, and perilously
witty. When the court of William III was overrun with place hunters
who</p>
<p>claimed to have helped the revolution, he made enemies by remarking,
“Rome was saved by geese, but I do not remember that these geese were
made consuls.” 33 *</p>

<p>into a Parliament, proceeded to what it deemed the first necessity of
govern- ment — a new oath of allegiance and submission to William III as
head not only of the state but of the Established Church. It was another
of h istory’s humors that the Anglican Church, which for a century had
been persecut- ing Calvinists (Presbyterians, Puritans, and other
Dissenters), should now accept a Dutch Calvinist as its head.</p>
<p>Four hundred Anglican clergymen, adhering to the doctrine of the
divine right of kings, and therefore questioning William’s right to
rule, refused to</p>
<p>Brought up in predestinarian Calvinism, William could not sympathize
with the Anglican view that a Presbyterian should be excluded from
office or Parliament. He had already encouraged toleration in the United
Prov- inces, and had made no religious discrimination in his
friendships. Predes- tinarian Calvinism had become for William a trust
in himself as an agent of destiny; and in this assurance he could look
without bigotry upon Dissent as itself an instrument of that mysterious
Power, more than personal, which he variously called Fortune,
Providence, or God. 37 He saw in the religious divisions of England a
force that could tear the nation apart if not mod- erated into
amity.</p>
<p>It was clever of the Privy Council to have its Toleration Act
proposed to Parliament by Nottingham, who was known as a zealous and
loyal son of the Anglican Church; his advocacy disarmed the rigorists.
So this first achievement of the new reign passed both houses with
little opposition (May 24, 1689). It allowed freedom of public worship
to all groups that accepted Trinitarianism and Biblical inspiration, and
that explicitly re- pudiated transubstantiation and the religious
supremacy of the pope. Bap- tists were permitted to defer baptism to
maturity, and by the Affirmation Act of 1696 the Quakers were allowed to
substitute a solemn promise for an oath. Unitarians and Catholics were
excluded from toleration. An at- tempt was made by William and his
Council, in the Comprehension Bill introduced later in 1 689, to have
various dissenting groups admitted to the Anglican Church, but this
measure failed to pass. Dissenters were still banned from the
universities, and were ineligible, to Parliament or public</p>

<p>Xoffice unless they received the Sacrament according to the Anglican
rite. A renewed law against blasphemy (1697) decreed imprisonment for
attacks upon any basic Christian doctrine. There was no further legal
extension of religious freedom in England till 1778; nevertheless
toleration was greater than in any other European country after 1685,
except the United Prov- inces. In practice toleration slowly widened as
England grew strong enough to lose its fear of invasion or internal
subversion by Catholic power.</p>
<p>Even the Catholics enjoyed, under William, an increasing security.
The King explained that he could not maintain his alliances with
Catholic states if he oppressed Catholics in England. 38 For a decade
Catholic priests could say Mass in private homes, and were not molested
if they kept a judicious disguise in public. Toward the close of the
reign (1699), when the Tories and the rigorists got the upper hand in
Parliament, the laws against Catholics were sharpened. Any priests
convicted of saying Mass, or of discharging any other sacerdotal
function, except in the house of an ambassador, was made liable to life
imprisonment; and to implement the law a reward of a hundred pounds was
offered to anyone who procured a conviction. The same penalty was
decreed for any Catholic who undertook the public edu- cation of the
young. No parent might send a child abroad to be educated in the
Catholic faith. No one might purchase or inherit land except after
taking the oath of royal supremacy in religion, and against
transubstantiation. All persons refusing to take such oaths forfeited
their inheritance to the govern- ment. 39 William pardoned and pensioned
Titus Oates (1689).</p>
<p>The Catholics of Ireland brought a renewed persecution by organizing
a revolt that aimed to restore James II. Richard Talbot, Earl of
Tyrconnel, collected 36,000 troops, and invited James to come from
France to lead them. Louis XIV, who had set up the deposed King in a
court of his own at St.-Germain, with an annual allowance of 600,000
francs, now equipped a fleet for him, accompanied him to Brest, and bade
him a famous adieu: “The best that I can wish you is that we shall never
see each other again.” 40 James landed in Ireland (March 12, 1689) with
twelve hundred men, was escorted to Dublin by Talbot, summoned an Irish
Parliament, and pro- claimed freedom of worship for all loyal subjects.
The Parliament met on May 7, repealed the Act of Settlement of 1652, and
ordered the return to their former Irish possessors of all lands taken
from them since 1641. Wil- liam sent his Huguenot general Schomberg to
Ireland with ten thousand men; Louis countered by dispatching seven
thousand French veterans to James’s aid; William himself crossed to
Ireland in June, 1690. When the opposed armies met in the battle of the
Boyne (July 1), James, who had once been brave, rode off in panic on
seeing that his forces were giving way. Soon he was back in
St.-Germain.</p>
<p>William would have been glad to make peace with the Irish on the</p>
<p>status quo ante, but the Protestant leaders and forces under him
demanded</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>the complete eradication of rebellious elements, and a further
appropriation of Irish lands. William returned to England, leaving his
army in charge of Godert de Ginkel, now Earl of Athlone; Schomberg had
died in his victory at the Boyne. The King instructed Ginkel to offer a
free pardon, freedom of worship, exemption from the antipapal oath of
supremacy, and recovery of their estates, to all rebels who should lay
down their arms. 41 Ginkel secured the surrender of Galway and Limerick
on these terms. By the Treaty of Limerick (October 3, 1691) the Irish
rebels accepted the paci- fication offered by William, and in March,
1692, a royal proclamation an- nounced the end of the Irish war.</p>
<p>The Protestants of Ireland denounced the treaty as a surrender to
papists, and appealed to the English Parliament. That assembly at once
(October 22, 1691) passed an act debarring from the Irish Parliament any
man who would not take the oath of supremacy and declare against
transubstantiation. The new Irish Parliament, entirely Protestant,
refused to recognize the Treaty of Limerick. While William absorbed
himself in organizing Europe against Louis XIV, the Dublin Parliament
laid upon Irish Catholics a new series of penal acts frankly overriding
the peace that William and Mary had signed. Catholic schools and
colleges were made illegal; Catholic priests were subject to
deportation; no Catholic was to carry arms, or possess a horse worth
more than five pounds; and any Protestant heiress who mar- ried a
Catholic was to suffer the forfeiture of her estate. 42 The confiscation
of Irish property went on until “there was practically no more land to
confiscate.” 43 It was almost impossible for an Irish Catholic to win a
suit in an Irish court, and crimes against Irish Catholics were rarely
punished. To complete the desolation of Ireland, its woolen industry,
which had grown to the point of competing with England’s, was ruined by
acts of the English Parliament forbidding the exportation of wool from
Ireland to any country but England, and stifling even this trade by
deliberately prohibitive tariffs (1696). Poverty, beggary, famine, and
desperate lawlessness covered the island outside the English Pale. In
the sixty years following the Glorious Revolution half the Catholic
population, which had neared a million in 1688, emigrated, taking the
best blood of the people to foreign lands.</p>
<p>In England every economic class now prospered except the proletariat
and the peasantry. Textile workers suffered from foreign competition and
from invention; in 1710 the stocking knitters went on strike against the
introduction of stocking looms and the use of low-paid apprentices to
operate them. 44 But the national product was rising; we may judge it
from the increase of the average annual revenues of the government from
£ 500,- 000 in the sixteenth century to £ 7,500,000 in the seventeenth;
45 the increase came partly from inflation, but chiefly from the
expansion of manufacturing and foreign trade.</p>
<p>Even so, the revenues did not suffice, for William was raising great
armies</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>X304</p>
<p>to fight Louis XIV. Taxes rose beyond precedent, but more money was
needed. In January, 1693, Charles Montagu, first Earl of Halifax, as
lord of the treasury, revolutionized governmental finance by persuading
Parliament to float a public loan of ^900,000, on which the government
promised to pay seven per cent yearly. Toward the end of 1693, as
expenditures were dangerously outrunning receipts, a group of bankers
agreed to lend the government £ 1,200,000 at eight per cent, secured by
an added duty on shipping. The idea of such incorporated lending had
been suggested by William Paterson three years before. Montagu now gave
it official support, and Parliament accepted the plan. The lenders
(following Genoese, Vene- tian, and Dutch precedents) organized
themselves as “the Governors and Company of the Bank of England,” which
was chartered on July 27, 1694. They borrowed money at four and a half
per cent from diverse sources, lent it to the government at eight per
cent, and made additional profits by undertaking all the functions of a
bank. So originated, the Bank of England made further loans to the
government, and in 1696 it received from Parliament a monoply of such
loans. After many vicissitudes it be- came a leading factor in the
remarkable stability of the English government from the accession of
William and Mary to our own day. As early as 1694 the notes of the bank,
backed by deposits and payable in gold on demand, were accepted as legal
tender; this was the first genuine paper money in England. 46 *</p>
<p>Montagu further distinguished his tenure at the treasury by reforming
the metallic currency (1696). The good coins of Charles II and James II
were being hoarded, melted, or exported, while the clipped or damaged
coins of Elizabeth and James I bore the brunt of use, and lost in
purchasing power a considerable part of their face value. Montagu called
in his friends John Locke, Isaac Newton, and John Somers to give England
a more stable currency. They designed new coins with a milled edge that
would defy clipping; they called in the old coins, which were redeemed
at their face value; the state took the loss, and England had a sound
currency that was the model and envy of Europe. In 1698 the London Stock
Exchange was opened, and an era of financial speculation began which
soon produced the South Sea Company (1711) and the bursting of its
“bubble” (1720). In 1688 Edward Lloyd set up in a London coffeehouse the
insurance firm now known with proud simplicity as Lloyd’s. In 1693
Edmund Halley issued the first known tables of mortality. All these
financial developments emphasized and extended the role of the moneyed
interest in the affairs of England, and</p>

<p>THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>marked the rising importance of capitalists — providers and managers
of capital — in Britain.</p>
<p>Above the expanding economy the political battle steamed with the
strife for power between the landowning Tories and the moneymaking
Whigs, between the English and the Scots, with plots to assassinate
William, and schemes to replace James on the throne. William was not
interested in the domestic affairs of England; he had conquered it
chiefly to align it with his homeland and other states against Louis
XIV; as Halifax put it, he had “taken England on his way to France.” 48
When the English discovered that this was his absorbing passion, he lost
all popularity. He was not an amiable king. He could be coldly cruel, as
in ordering the extirpation of the Mac- Donald clan of Glencoe for
tendering its allegiance tardily (1692). He was “silent and surly in
company,” for he spoke English with difficulty. He cared little for
women, and had terrible manners at table, so that the ladies of London
society called him “a Low - Dutch bear.” 49 He surrounded him- self with
Dutch guards and associates, and did not hide his opinion that the Dutch
were far superior to the English in economic ability, political judg-
ment, and moral character. He knew that many nobles were secretly ne-
gotiating with James II. He found corruption so prevalent around him
that he entered into it himself, and bought M.P.s like merchandise.
Everything was good that made for the checking of rampant France.</p>
<p>Because he left domestic affairs to his ministers, the era of
powerful ministries began (1695), °f “cabinets” united in responsibility
and action and dominated by one man, usually the lord of the treasury.
In 1697 his enemies the Tories came to power in an electoral overturn.
They so limited his authority and questioned his foreign policy that he
thought of resigning (1699). But when he laid his bent, asthmatic, and
tubercular body down to his final rest (March 8, 1702), he could console
his domestic defeats with the consciousness that he had at last brought
England into resolute</p>
<p>participation in the Grand Alliance (1701) which, after twelve years
of struggle, would bring the great Bourbon to his knees, save the
independence of Protestant Europe, and leave England free to spread her
power over the world.</p>

<p>The death of Queen Mary in 1695 had left her sister Anne heiress to
the throne. Brought up in danger and turmoil, Anne had become a timid
girl, pure in morals, simple in mind, strong in feeling, and seeking
consola- tion and courage in a devoted and humble friendship with her
childhood companion, the lively, laughing, skeptical, positive,
confident Sarah Jen-</p>

<p>Xnings. In 1678 Sarah, who was five years older than Anne, married
John Churchill, and in 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark. Both
marriages prospered, but they did not interfere with the close intimacy
of the two women. Anne waived all formality, playfully called Sarah (now
her lady of the bedchamber) “Mrs. Freeman,” and insisted on being called
not “Princess” but “Mrs. Morley.” When the two husbands deserted James
for William, Anne had to make a bitter choice between father and mate.
Her love for her husband and her friend decided her to leave for
Nottingham (November 26, 1688). On December 19 she and Sarah re- turned
to London and an alien King.</p>
<p>She never learned to like William III. She felt insulted and injured
when he gave to one of his friends the estate of her father, to which
she had a partial claim. By 1691 she was longing for the return of her
father to the throne. William reasonably suspected both Churchill (now
Earl -of Marl- borough) and his wife of intrigues with the deposed
ruler. Queen Mary ordered Anne to dismiss Sarah from her entourage. Anne
refused. On the next morning (January, 1692) Marlborough was dismissed
from his offices, and he and Sarah were banished from the court. Rather
than be separated from her friend, Anne, defying King and Queen, left
Whitehall Palace to live with Sarah at Sion House. On May 4 Marlborough
was sent to the Tower. Sarah often visited him there, and proposed to
end her association with Anne to appease the Queen. Whereupon Anne wrote
to her:</p>
<p>The last time he 〔the Bishop of Worcester〕 was here, I told him</p>
<p>that you had several times desired that you might go from me. . .
.</p>
<p>I beg it again for Christ Jesus’ sake that you would never name it
any more to me. For be assured, if you should ever do so cruel a thing
as to leave me, from that moment I shall never enjoy one quiet
horn:.</p>
<p>And should you do it without asking my consent (which if I ever</p>
<p>give you, may I never see the face of Heaven) I will shut myself
up</p>
<p>and never see the world more, but live where I may be forgot by</p>
<p>human kind. 50</p>
<p>As the evidence of Marlborough’s participation in any plot to restore
James proved inconclusive, William, who needed good generals, released
him, and restored him to favor and authority.</p>
<p>When Anne, now thirty-eight, became Queen, her preference for</p>
<p>morality, fidelity, and privacy changed the character of the English
court. The roisterers found no entry there, and retired disgruntled to
the coffee- houses and the stews. The moral Addison replaced the riotous
Rochester, and Steele wrote The Christian Hero. Anne’s avoidance of the
theater, and the example of her life, had some influence in improving
the tone of the English stage. She expressed her piety by turning over

“first fruits” and tithes (1704); this “Queen Anne’s Bounty” is still
paid annually by the British government. She bore children with almost
yearly regularity, but all except one died in childhood; none survived
her; and her spirit was darkened by many funerals.</p>
<p>If she could have determined national policy she would have made
peace with France, and would hav e acknowledged her dead father’s son as
what he claimed to be — James III. But the strong will of William III
had com- mitted England to the Grand Alliance; the dominant man in her
counsels, whom she had raised from Earl to Duke of Marlborough soon
after her accession, induced her to reign unhappily over ten years of
bloody and costly war. She was still under the influence of her friend,
now duchess, mistress of the robes and comptroller of the privy purse —
i.e., the Queen’s personal finances. Sarah received ,£5,100 a year, and
used her almost hyp- notic influence over Anne to advance the fortunes
of her husband. Marl- borough was appointed captain general of the land
forces, and it was at his suggestion that his friend Sidney Godolphin
was made secretary of the treasury; for Godolphin was anomalousy honest
as well as financially com- petent, and could be relied upon for prompt
remittances to army leaders, whose soldiers adjusted their courage to
their pay. It is pleasant to record that after spending half a lifetime
in charge of the treasury, Godolphin died a poor man. The hardheaded
Duchess of Marlborough thought him “the best man that ever lived.” 51
However, he gave his leisure to cockfight - ing, horse racing, and
gambling, which were considered such mild vices as to verge on
virtue.</p>
<p>Anne’s freedom from intellect allowed her ministers to
appropriate</p>
<p>much of the authority and initiative that Parliament had left to the
Crown; the political battles hereafter (except under George III) were to
be</p>
<p>between Parliament and ministers rather than between Parliament and
sovereign. In 1704 new figures entered her ministry: Robert Harley as
secretary of state, and Henry St. John as secretary for war. Both of
these men touched the history of literature: Harley as employer of Defoe
and Swift, and St. John — under his later title of Viscount Bolingbroke
— as influencing Pope and Voltaire, and as himself the author of once
famous essays, Letters on the Study of History and Idea of a Patriot
King. Both these ministers were hard drinkers, but this was no
distinction in the England of that day. Both entered office with the
support of Marlborough, but turned against him on the charge that he was
unnecessarily prolonging the War of the Spanish Succession.</p>
<p>St. John, born (1678) under Charles II, and dying (1751) in the
first</p>
<p>ye?* of the Encyclopedic, personified the passage of Europe from the
English Restoration to the French Enlightenment. He received too
much</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xreligion in his childhood, and shed too much of it in his manhood.
“I was obliged while yet a boy,” he tells us, “to read over the
commentaries of Dr. Manton, whose pride it was to have made 119 sermons
on the 119th P salm.” 52 At Eton and Oxford he sought and won pre
-eminence in brilliance of mind, careless idleness, and graceful
dissipation. He boasted of holding the maximum of wine without
intoxication, and of keeping the most expensive prostitute in the
kingdom. 53 In a monogamous moment he married a wealthy heiress; she
soon abandoned him because of his infidelity, but he continued, with
some interruptions, to enjoy her estates. He found it comparatively
inexpensive to get elected to Parliament in 1701. There his handsome
presence, his quick intelligence, and his fluid eloquence gained him
great influence in the Commons. He was only twenty-six when he entered
the ministry.</p>
<p>The outstanding achievement of that ministry was the parliamentary
union of England and Scotland. The two countries, though under the same
sovereign, had had their distinct parliaments, conflicting economies,
and hostile faiths; each had made war upon the other; and their jealous
tariffs had impeded trade. On January 16, 1707, the Scottish Parliament
accepted, and on March 6 the Queen ratified, the Articles of Union by
which the two kingdoms, while retaining their independent religions,
were to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain, under one
British</p>
<p>Parliament, and with complete freedom of trade. Sixteen Scottish
peers were to be seated in the House of Lords, forty-five Scottish
members were to be elected to the House of Commons, and the crosses of
St. George and St. Andrew were combined in a new flag, the Union Jack.
The Scottish masses did not welcome the merger, and for half a century
the old enmities luxuriated; but by 1750 the union was recognized as
beneficent. Scotland was spared many duplicative expenditures, and her
intellectual energy was freed to produce, in the second half of the
eighteenth century, a bright flowering of literature and philosophy.</p>
<p>Harley and St. John were deposed from the cabinet by a Whig victory
in October, 1707, but Harley continued to influence the Queen through
his cousin, Mrs. Abigail Masham. This lady had been introduced to Anne
by the Duchess of Marlborough. Her calm and complaisant temper soothed
the Queen, whose nerves, on edge with her new responsibilities, were
rasped by Sarah’s rampant voice and views. Sarah for a time welcomed her
release from constant attendance at the court, but she was soon alarmed
on discovering how rapidly her influence with the Queen was fading. Anne
was almost by nature a Tory, a pietist, and a lover of peace; Sarah was
a Whig of little faith, who laughed openly at the divine right of rulers
as humbug for the masses, and insisted on the Queen’s support of Marl -
borough’s desire for a war to the finish against France. Anne developed
a</p>
<p>CHAP. X) THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION 309</p>
<p>new firmness of mind as Sarah receded; and when Sarah raged at her
insolently she dismissed her from the court (1710). The Queen declared
that she felt now as if she had been freed from a long captivity.</p>
<p>In that year a Tory victory at the polls restored Harley and
Bolingbroke to power. Harley replaced Godolphin at the treasury,
Bolingbroke took the war office, and Jonathan Swift became their most
effective pamphleteer. Harley was made Earl of Oxford (1711), and
St. John was named</p>
<p>Viscount Bolingbroke (1712). The courtesans of London, on hearing of
Bolingbroke’s elevation, rejoiced, saying, “Bolingbroke gets eight
thousand guineas yearly, and all for us!” # The Tory majority put
through both houses ( 1 7 1 1 ) a measure requiring, for eligibility to
Parliament, the posses- sion of landed property worth a minimum of three
hundred pounds a year for borough representatives, and six hundred
pounds yearly for county delegates. 54 Now was the hedyday of the landed
aristocracy in England.</p>
<p>The new ministry was resolved — Marlborough refused — to end the war
by making a separate peace with France. In 17 11 Harley brought before
the Commons an indictment of Marlborough on charges of peculation. It
was alleged that the Duke was amassing a large private fortune as
captain general of the British forces, and through other offices held by
him; that in addition to his annual salaries of some sixty thousand
pounds he had received six thousand a year from Sir Solomon Medina, the
contractor who sold him bread for the army; and that he had deducted for
his own use two and a half per cent of the sums received by him from
foreign govern- ments for the pay of foreign troops under his command.
No one except Sir John Vanbrugh, its architect, liked the architecture
of the immense Blenheim Palace that Marlborough was building at
Woodstock, near Oxford, and for which the Queen had ordered the
government to pay. Begun in 1705, it was only half finished in 17 11,
and had already cost £ 1 3 4,000 ; 56 before its completion it would
cost £ 300,000, of which the government paid four fifths. 56</p>
<p>Marlborough replied that the two-and-a-half-per-cent deduction was by
custom allowed to the commander to finance, without public record, the
secret service and espionage which he had guided to good results; he
produced the Queen’s signed warrant authorizing him to make this deduc -
tion; all the foreign allies affirmed that they too had authorized the
deduc- tion; and the Elector of Hanover added that the money had been
wisely applied, and had “contributed to the gaining of so many battles.”
57 On the Medina subsidy Marlborough’s defense was not so convincing.
The House condemned him by a vote of 276 to 175, and the Queen dismissed
him from all his offices (December 31, 17 1 1). He departed into
voluntary exile,</p>

Voltaire.</p>
<p>3io</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xand remained in Holland or Germany till the end of the reign.
The</p>
<p>ministers appointed James Butler, second Duke of Ormonde, to command
the British armies, and authorized him to make the same deductions from
the bread contracts and the foreign payments as those for which Marl-
borough had been condemned. 68 But Marlborough’s fall was accepted by
the British people as a step toward peace.</p>
<p>The Tories and the Whigs found a new source of strife in the problem
of succession to the throne. In 1701, Anne’s last surviving child having
died, Parliament, to forestall another Stuart restoration, had passed an
Act of Settlement by which, in default of issue of William III and
Princess Anne, the crown of England would pass to “Princess Sophia or
the heirs of he r body, being Protestants.” Sophia, wife of the Elector
of Hanover, was safely Protestant, and fractionally of royal British
blood, as a grand-</p>
<p>daughter of James I. Anne had accepted this arrangement as
guaranteeing a Protestant England; but now that her life neared its end
her sympathy for her disowned brother grew warmer, and she left no doubt
that if James III would consent to abandon Catholicism she would support
his claim to the throne. The Whigs gave their full support to the
Hanoverian succes- sion, the Tories inclined to the Queen’s view.
Bolingbroke negotiated with James; the Prince refused to surrender his
Catholic faith; but Bolingbroke, to whom religions were but diverse
garments to dignify death, pulled every wire to have the Act of
Settlement repealed, and give James the succession. He quarreled with
Harley for moving too slowly in this matter; at his suggestion Anne
reluctantly dismissed Harley, and for two days Bolingbroke seemed
supreme.</p>
<p>But on July 29 the Queen, agitated and depressed by the quarrels of
her ministers, fell seriously ill. The Protestants of England armed
themselves to resist any attempt at a Stuart restoration. The Privy
Council rejected Bolingbroke’s policy, and persuaded the vacillating
Queen to make the Duke of Shrewsbury lord high treasurer and head of her
government. On August 1, 1714, Anne died. Sophia had died two months
before, but the Act of Settlement was still in force. The C ouncil sent
word to Sophia’s son, the Elector of Hanover, that he was now George I,
King of England.</p>
<p>The reigns of William and Mary and Anne (1689-1714) were vital</p>
<p>years in the history of England. Despite moral laxity, political
corruption, and internal strife, they accomplished a dynastic
revolution, they declared England irrevocably Protestant, and they
definitively transferred govern- mental supremacy from the Crown to the
Parliament. They saw the development of powerful ministers still further
reducing the role of the monarch, and they witnessed in 1707 the last
royal veto of parliamentary legislation. They established a wider degree
of religious toleration and free-</p>

<p>dom of the press. They peacefully united England and Scotland in
a</p>
<p>stronger Britain. They turned back the attempt of the most powerful
of modem kings to make France the dictator of Europe; instead, they made
England mistress of the seas. They expanded, to historic effects,
England’s possessions in America. They saw the victories of English
science and philosophy in Newton’s Frincipia and Locke’s Essay
concerning Human Understanding. And the brief twelve years of the gentle
Anne saw such an outburst of literature — Defoe, Addison, Steele, Swift,
and the first period of Alexander Pope — as was not matched in that age
anywhere in the world.</p>
