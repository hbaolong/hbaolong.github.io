<h4 id="chapter-xxxvii">CHAPTER XXXVII</h4>
<p>Christian Science</p>
<p>1095-1300</p>
<p>I. THE MAGICAL ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>T HE Romans at their Imperial height had valued applied science, but
had almost forgotten the pure science of the Greeks. Already in the
Natural History of the elder Pliny we find supposedly medieval
superstitions on every other page. The indifference of the Romans
co-operated with that of the Christians to almost dry up the stream of
science long before the bar- barian invasions littered the routes of
cultural transmission with the debris of a ruined society. What remained
of Greek science in Europe was buried in the libraries of
Constantinople, and that remnant suffered in the sack of 1 204. Greek
science migrated through Syria into Islam in the ninth century, and
stirred Moslem thought to one of the most remarkable cultural awaken-
ings in history, while Christian Europe struggled to lift itself out of
bar- barism and superstition.</p>
<p>Science and philosophy, in the medieval West, had to grow up in such
an atmosphere of myth, legend, miracle, omens, demons, prodigies, magic,
as- trology, divination, and sorcery as comes only in ages of chaos and
fear. All these had existed in the pagan world, and exist today, but
tempered by a civi- lized humor and enlightenment. They were strong in
the Semitic world, and triumphed after Averroes and Maimonides. In
Western Europe, from the sixth to the eleventh century, they broke the
dikes of culture, and over- whelmed the medieval mind in an ocean of
occultism and credulity. The greatest, most learned men shared in this
credulity: Augustine thought that the pagan gods still existed as
demons, and that fauns and satyrs were real; 1 Abelard thought that
demons can work magic through their intimate ac- quaintance with the
secrets of nature; 2 Alfonso the Wise accepted magic, and sanctioned
divination by the stars; 3 how, then, should lesser men doubt?</p>
<p>A multitude of mysterious and supernatural beings had descended into
Christianity from pagan antiquity, and were still coming into it from
Ger- many, Scandinavia, and Ireland as trolls, elves, giants, fairies,
goblins, gnomes, ogres, banshees, mysterious dragons, blood-sucking
vampires; and new superstitions were always entering Europe from the
East. Dead men walked the air as ghosts; men who had sold themselves to
the Devil roamed woods and fields as werewolves; the souls of children
dead before baptism</p>
<p>984</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 985</p>
<p>haunted the marshes as will- o’ -the-wisps. When St. Edmund Rich saw
a flight of black crows he recognized them at once as a flock of devils
come to fetch the soul of a local usurer . 4 When a demon is exorcised
from a man, said many a medieval story, a big black fly — sometimes a
dog — could be seen issuing from his mouth . 5 The population of devils
never declined.</p>
<p>A hundred objects — herbs, stones, amulets, rings, gems — were worn
for their magic power to ward off devils and bring good luck. The
horseshoe was lucky because it had the shape of the crescent moon, which
had once been a goddess. Sailors, at the mercy of the elements, and
peasants, subject to all the whims of earth and sky, saw the
supernatural at every turn, and lived in a vital medium of
superstitions. The attribution of magic powers to certain numbers came
down from Pythagoras through the Christian Fathers: three, the number of
the Trinity, was the holiest number, and stood for the soul; four
represented the body; seven, their sum, symbolized the complete man;
hence a predilection for seven — ages of man, planets, sacraments,
cardinal virtues, deadly sins. A sneeze at the wrong time was a bad
omen, and had better be disarmed with a “God bless you” in any case.
Philters could be used to create or destroy love. Conception could be
avoided by spitting thrice into the mouth of a frog, or holding a jasper
pebble in the hand dur- ing coitus.® The enlightened Agobard, Archbishop
of Lyons in the ninth century, complained that “things of such absurdity
are believed by Chris - tians as no one ever aforetime could induce the
heathen to believe.” 7</p>
<p>The Church struggled against the paganism of superstition, condemned
many beliefs and practices, and punished them with a gradation of
penances. She denounced black magic — resort to demons to obtain power
over events; but it flourished in a thousand secret places. Its
practitioners circulated privately a Liber perditionis, or Book of
Damnation, giving the names, habi- tats, and special powers of the major
demons . 8 Nearly everybody believed in some magical means of turning
the power of supernatural beings to a de- sired end. John of Salisbury
tells of magic used by a deacon, a priest, and an archbishop . 9 The
simplest form was by incantation; a formula was recited, usually several
times; by such formulas a miscarriage might be averted, a sickness
healed, an enemy put out of the way. Probably the majority of Christians
considered the sign of the cross, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Ave Maria
as magic incantations, and used holy water and the sacraments as magic
rites bringing miraculous effects.</p>
<p>Belief in witchcraft was next to universal. The Penitential Book of
the bishop of Exeter condemned women “who profess to be able to change
men’s minds by sorcery and enchantments, as from hate to love or from
love to hate, or to bewitch or steal men’s goods,” or who “profess to
ride on cer - tain nights and on certain beasts with a host of demons in
women’s shape, and to be enrolled in the company of such” 10 — the
“Witches’ Sabbath” that became notorious in the fourteenth century. A
simple witchery consisted</p>
<p>986 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>in making a wax model of an intended victim, piercing it with
needles, and pronouncing formulas of cursing; a minister of Philip IV
was accused of hiring a witch to do this to an image of the King. Some
women were believed able to injure or kill by a look of their “evil
eye.” Berthold of Regensburg thought that more women than men would go
to hell because so many women practiced witchcraft — “spells for getting
a husband, spells for the marriage, spells before the child is bom,
spells before the christening … it is a marvel that men lose not their
wits for the monstrous witchcrafts that women practice on them.” 11
Visigothic law accused witches of invoking demons, sacrificing to
devils, causing storms, etc., and ordered that those convicted of such
offenses should have their heads shaved and receive two hundred stripes.
12 The laws of Cnut in England recognized the possibility of slaying a
person by magic means. The Church was at first lenient with these
popular beliefs, looking upon them as pagan survivals that would die
out; on the contrary they grew and spread; and in 1 298 the Inquisition
began its cam- paign to suppress witchcraft by burning women at the
stake. Many theo- logians sincerely believed that certain women were in
league with demons, and that the faithful must be protected from their
spells. Caesarius of Heister- bach assures us that in his time many men
entered into pacts with devils; 18 and it is alleged that such
practitioners of black magic so disdained the Church that they
travestied her rites by worshiping Satan in a Black Mass. 14 Thousands
of sick or timid people believed themselves to be possessed by devils.
The prayers, formulas, and ceremonies of exorcism used by the Church may
have been intended as psychological medicine to calm supersti- tious
minds.</p>
<p>Medieval medicine was in some measure a branch of theology and
ritual. Augustine thought that the diseases of mankind were caused by
demons, and Luther agreed with him; it seemed logical, therefore, to
cure illness with prayer, and epidemics by religious processions or
building churches. So Santa Maria della Salute at Venice was raised to
check a plague, and the prayers of St. Gerbold, Bishop of Bayeux, cured
that city of an epidemic of dysentery. 15 Good physicians welcomed the
aid of religious faith in effecting cures; they recommended prayer, and
the wearing of amulets. 16 As far back as Edward the Confessor we find
English rulers blessing rings for the cure of epilepsy. 17 Kings, having
been consecrated by religious touch, felt that they might cure by
imposition of hands. Persons suffering from scrofula were supposed to be
especially amenable to the royal touch; hence the name “king’s evil” for
that ailment. St. Louis labored assiduously with such im - positions;
and Philip of Valois is said to have “touched” 1,500 persons at one
sitting. 18</p>
<p>There were magical means to knowledge as well as to health. Most of
the old pagan methods for divining the future or seeing the absent
flourished</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 987</p>
<p>throughout the Middle Ages despite repeated condemnation by the
Church. Thomas a Becket, wishing to advise Henry II about a contemplated
invasion of Brittany, consulted an aruspex, who foretold the future by
watching the flight of birds, and a chiromancer, who predicted by
studying the lines of the hand. 19 This art of palmistry claimed divine
sanction from a verse in Exodus (xiii, 9) : “It shall be for a sign unto
thee upon thine hand.” Other prophets tried to foretell events by
observing the movements of the winds (aeromancy) or the waters
(hydromancy), or the smoke rising from a fire (pyromancy) . Some,
imitating the Moslems, marked points at random upon the earth (or upon
any writing material), connected the points with lines, and told
fortunes from the geometrical figures so formed (geomancy). Some, it was
alleged, learned the future from the evoked dead (necro- mancy) ;
Albertus Grotus, at the request of Frederick Barbarossa, evoked (we are
told) the spirit of the Emperor’s wife. 20 Some consulted prophetic
books, like those purporting to contain the predictions of the Sibyls,
or Merlin, or Solomon. Some opened the Bible at random ( sortes
sanctorum ) or the Aeneid ( sortes vergilianae ) , and told the future
from the first verse seen. The gravest medieval historians nearly always
found (like Livy) that important events had been directly or
symbolically foretold by portents, visions, prophecies, or dreams. There
were heaps of books — e.g., one by Arnold of Villanova — offering the
latest scientific interpretation of dreams (oneiromancy) — not much
sillier than those which famous scientists have written in the twentieth
century. Nearly all these modes of divination or clairvoyance had been
practiced in antiquity, and are practiced today.</p>
<p>But pur time, despite some effort, has not yet equaled the Age of
Faith- in Islam, Judaism, or Christendom — in belief that the future is
decipherably written in the stars. If the climate of the earth, and the
growth of plants, could be so clearly-influenced by the heavenly bodies,
why should not these affect — nay, determine — the growth, nature,
illnesses, periods, fertility, epi- demics, revolutions, and destinies
of men or states? So nearly every medieval mind believed. A professional
astrologer could be found in the household of almost every prince or
king. Doctors bled their patients, as many farmers still plant their
seeds, according to phases of the moon. Most universities gave courses
in astrology, meaning by it the science of the stars; astronomy was
included in astrology, and progressed largely through astrologic
interest and aims. Sanguine students professed to have found predictable
regularities in the effects of celestial bodies on the earth. Persons
born under the ascendancy of Saturn would be cold, cheerless, saturnine;
those born under Jupiter, tem- perate and jovial; under Mars, ardent and
martial; under Venus, tender and fruitful; under. Mercury, inconstant,
mercurial; under a high moon, melan- choly almost to the point of
lunacy. Genethlialogy predicted the entire life of the individual from
the position of the constellations at his birth. To draw</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>988</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>a proper horoscope, therefore, one had to observe the hour, take the
precise moment of birth, the precise position of the stars. Astronomic
tables were compiled chiefly to aid the drawing of such horoscopes.</p>
<p>Certain names stand out in this period as pundits of the occult.
Peter of Abano almost reduced philosophy to astrology; and Arnold of
Villanova, a famous physician, had a predilection for magic. Cecco
d’Ascoli (1257? -</p>
<p>1327), who taught astrology at the University of Bologna, boasted
that he could read a man’s thoughts, or tell what he concealed in his
hand, by know - ing the date of his birth. To illustrate his views he
cast the horoscope of Christ, and showed how the constellations at the
Nativity had made the cru- cifixion inevitable. He was condemned by the
Inquisition ( 1 3 24) , abjured, was spared on condition of silence,
went to Florence, practiced astrology for numerous clients, and was
burned at the stake for denying the freedom of the will (1327). Many
sincere students — Constantine the African, Ger- bert, Albertus Magnus,
Roger Bacon, Vincent of Beauvais — were accused of magic, and of
relations with devils, because the people could not believe that their
knowledge had been obtained by natural means. Michael Scot earned the
suspicion by writing famous treatises on the occult: a Liber introduc-
torius on astrology; a Physio gnomia on the correlation of qualities of
char- acter with peculiarities of body; and two texts of alchemy.
Michael con- demned magic, but enjoyed writing about it. He listed
twenty-eight methods of divination, and seems to have believed in all of
them. 21 Unlike most of his contemporaries he made careful observations,
and some experiments; on the other hand he suggested that carrying a
jasper or topaz would help a man to preserve continence. 22 He was
clever enough to keep on good terms with both Frederick II and the
popes; but the inexorable Dante consigned him to hell.</p>
<p>The Church and the Inquisition were part of the environment of
European science in the thirteenth century. The universities for the
most part operated under ecclesiastical authority and supervision. The
Church, however, al- lowed considerable latitude of doctrine to
professors, and in many cases en- couraged scientific pursuits. William
of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris (d. 1 249) , promoted scientific
investigation, and ridiculed those who were ready to see the direct
action of God in any unusual event. Bishop Grosseteste of Lincoln was so
advanced in the study of mathematics, optics, and experimental sci- ence
that Roger Bacon ranked him with Aristotle. The Dominican and Fran-
ciscan Orders made no known objection to the scientific studies of
Albertus Magnus or Roger Bacon. St. Bernard and some other zealots
discouraged the pursuit of science, but this view was not adopted by the
Church. 2 ® She found it hard to reconcile herself to the dissection of
human cadavers, for it was among her basic doctrines that man was made
in the image of God and that the body, as well as the soul, would rise
from the grave; and this reluctance was fully shared by the Moslems and
the Jews, 24 and by the people at large. 25</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 989</p>
<p>Guido of Vige vano in 1345 spoke of dissection as “forbidden by
the</p>
<p>Church”; 26 but we find no ecclesiastical prohibition before the bull
De sep - ulturis of Boniface VIII in 1300; and this merely forbade the
cutting up of corpses and the boiling away of their flesh in order to
send the sterilized bones of dead Crusaders back to their relatives for
burial at home. 27 This may have been misinterpreted as forbidding
post-mortem dissection, but we find the Italian surgeon Mondino boiling
and dissecting corpses about 1320, without any known ecclesiastical
protest. 28</p>
<p>If the achievements of medieval science in the West should seem
meager in the following summary, let us remember that it grew in a
hostile environ- ment of superstition and magic, in an age that drew the
best minds into law and theology, and at a time when nearly all men
believed that the major prob- lems of cosmic and human origin, nature,
and destiny had been solved. Nevertheless, after 1150, as wealth and
leisure grew, and translations began to pour in from Islam, the mind of
Western Europe was aroused from its torpor, curiosity flared into
eagerness, men began to discuss the brave old world of the unfettered
Greeks, and within a century all Latin Europe was astir with science and
philosophy.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MATHEMATICAL REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>The first great name in the science of this period is Leonardo
Fibonacci of Pisa.</p>
<p>Sumerian mathematics, born of forgotten parentage, had descended
through Babylonia to Greece; Egyptian geometry, still visible in the
pyra- mids, had passed, perhaps through Crete and Rhodes, to Ionia and
Greece; Greek mathematics had gone to India in the wake of Alexander,
and had played a part in the Hindu development that culminated in
Brahmagupta (5 88? -660); about 775, translations were made of Hindu
mathematicians, and soon afterward of Greek mathematicians, into Arabic;
about 830 the Hindu numerals entered Eastern Islam; about 1000 Gerbert
brought them to France; in the eleventh and twelfth centuries Greek,
Arabic, and Hebrew mathematics streamed into Western Europe through
Spain and Sicily, and came with Italian merchants to Venice and Genoa,
Amalfi and Pisa. Trans- mission is to civilization what reproduction is
to life.</p>
<p>Another line of transmission appeared in the sixth century b.c. in
the form of the Chinese abacus (Greek abax, a board), an instrument for
counting by transferring little bamboo rods from one group to another;
its descendant, the suanpan, is still used by the Chinese. In the fifth
century b.c., says Herod- otus, the Egyptians reckoned with pebbles,
“bringing the hand from right to left”; the Greeks proceeded
contrariwise. The Romans used several forms</p>
<p>99° the age of faith (chap, xxxvn</p>
<p>of the abacus; in one form the counters slid in grooves; they were
made of stone, metal, or colored glass, and were called calculi, little
stones. 29 Boethius, about 525, mentioned the abacus as enabling one to
count by tens; but this invitation to a decimal system was ignored. The
merchants of Italy used the abacus, but wrote the results in clumsy
Roman numerals.</p>
<p>Leonardo Fibonacci was bom at Pisa in 1180. His father was manager of
a Pisan trade agency in Algeria; Leonardo in adolescence joined him
there, and was taught by a Moslem master. He traveled in Egypt, Syria,
Greece, and Sicily, studied the methods of the merchants, and learned to
reckon, he tells us, “by a marvelous method through the nine figures of
the Indians”; 30 here at the outset of their European career the new
numerals were properly called Hindu, apd what is now a bore and chore of
our childhood was then a wonder and delight. Perhaps Leonardo learned
Greek as well as Arabic; in any case we find him well acquainted with
the mathematics of Archimedes, Euclid, Hero, and Diophantus. In 1202 he
published his Liber abaci; it was the first thorough European exposition
of the Hindu numerals, the zero, and the decimal system by a Christian
author, and it marked the rebirth of mathe- matics in Latin Christendom.
The same work introduced Arabic algebra to Western Europe, and made a
minor revolution in that science by occasionally using letters, instead
of numbers, to generalize and abbreviate equations. 31 In his Practica
geometriae (1220) Leonardo, for the first time in Christen- dom so far
as we know, applied algebra to the treatment of geometrical theo- rems.
In two smaller works of the year 1 225 he made original contributions to
the solution of equations of the first and second degree. In that year
Fred- erick II presided at Pisa over a mathematical tournament in which
different problems were set by John of Palermo and solved by
Fibonacci.</p>
<p>Despite his epoch-making work, the new method of calculation was long
resisted by the merchants of Europe; many of them preferred to finger
the abacus and write the results with Roman numerals; as late as 1 299
the abacists of Florence had a law passed against the use of the “new -
fangled figures.” 32 Only a few mathematicians realized that the new
symbols, the zero, and the decimal alignment of units, tens, hundreds .
. . opened the way to such devel- opments of mathematics as were almost
impossible with the old letter nu- merals of Greeks, Romans, and Jews.
Not till the sixteenth century did the Hindu numerals finally replace
the Roman; in England and America the duodecimal system of reckoning
survives in many fields; 10 has not finally won its thousand-year-long
war against 12.</p>
<p>Mathematics in the Middle Ages had three purposes: the service of
mechanics, the keeping of business accounts, and the charting of the
skies. Mathematics, physics, and astronomy were closely allied, and
those who wrote on one of them usually contributed to the others as
well. So John of Holywood (in Yorkshire), known to the Latin world as
Joannes de Sacrobosco, studied at Oxford, taught at Paris, wrote a
Tractatus de sphaera — Treatise on the (Earthly) Sphere — and an</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 991</p>
<p>exposition of the new mathematics, Algorismus vulgaris — Mathematics
for the Millions ( c . 1230). Algorismus , a corruption of the name
al-Khwarizmi, was the Latin term for an arithmetical system using the
Hindu numerals. John credited the “Arabs” with the invention of this
system, and was partly responsible for the</p>
<p>Interest in astronomy was maintained by the needs of navigation and
the pas- sion for astrology. The immense authority of the oft-translated
Almagest petri- fied the astronomy of Christian Europe into the’
Ptolemaic theory of eccentrics</p>
<p>Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, and Roger Bacon felt the force of the
criticisms that the Moorish astronomer al-Bitruji had aimed at this
system in the twelfth cen- tury; but no satisfactory alternative to
Ptolemy’s celestial mechanics was found before Copernicus. Christian
astronomers in the thirteenth century pictured the planets as revolving
about the earth; the fixed stars, snared in a crystal firmament, and
steered by divine intelligences, revolved as a regimented host around
the earth; the center and summit of the universe was that same man whom
the theo- logians described as a miserable worm tainted with sin and
mostly doomed to hell. The suggestion offered by Heracleides Ponticus,
four centuries before Christ, that the apparent daily motion of the
heavens was due to the axial rotation of the earth, was discussed by
Semitic astronomers in the thirteenth century, but was quite forgotten
iir Christendom. Another notion of Heracleides, that Mer- cury and Venus
revolve about the sun, had been handed down by Macrobius and Martianus
Capella; John Scotus Erigena had seized upon it in the eighth century,
and had extended it to Mars and Jupiter; the heliocentric system was on
the verge of victory; 34 but these brilliant hypotheses were among the
casualties of the Dark Ages, and the earth held the center of the stage
till 1521. All astronomers, how- ever, agreed that the earth is a
sphere. 35</p>
<p>The astronomical instruments and tables of the West were imported
from Islam, or were modeled on Islamic originals. In 1091 Walcher of
Lorraine, later Prior of Malvern Abbey, observed lunar eclipses in Italy
with an astrolabe; this is the earliest known case of observational
astronomy in the Christian West; but even two centuries later ( c .
1296) William of St. Cloud had to remind astrono- mers, by precept and
example, that the science grew best on observation rather than on
reading or philosophy. The best contribution to Christian astronomy in
this period was the Alfonsine Tables of celestial movements, prepared
for Alfonso the Wise by two Spanish Jews.</p>
<p>The accumulation of astronomic data revealed the imperfections of the
calen- dar established by Julius Caesar (46 b.c.) from the work of
Sosigenes, which made the year too long by eleven minutes and fourteen
seconds; and the increas- ing intercourse of astronomers, merchants, and
historians across frontiers exposed the inconvenience of conflicting
calendars. Al-Biruni had made a useful study of the rival systems of
dividing time and dating events ( c . 1000) ; Aaron ben Meshul- lam and
Abraham bar Hiyya furthered the study in 1106 and 1122; and Robert
Grosseteste and Roger Bacon followed with constructive proposals in the
thir-</p>

<p>(chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>teenth century. The Computus (c. 1232) of Grosseteste — a set of
tables for calcu- lating astronomic events and movable dates (e.g.,
Easter) — was the first step to- ward the Gregorian calendar (1582) that
guides and confuses us today.</p>

<li>THE EARTH AND ITS LIFE</li>
</ol>
<p>The least progressive medieval science was geology. The earth was the
chosen home of Christ, and the shell of hell, and weather was the whim
of God. Moslem, Jew, and Christian alike covered mineralogy with
superstition, and composed “lapidaries” on the ma gical powers of
stones. Marbod, Bishop of Rennes (1035-</p>
<p>1123), wrote in Latin verse a popular Liber lapidum , describing the
occult quali- ties of sixty precious stones; a sapphire held in the hand
during prayer, said this erudite bishop, would secure a more favorable
answer from God. 36 An opal folded in a bay leaf rendered its holder
invisible; an amethyst made him immune to intoxication; a diamond made
him invincible. 37</p>
<p>The same eager curiosity that spawned superstitions upon the minerals
of the earth sent medieval men wandering over Europe and the East, and
slowly en- riched geography. Giraldus Cambrensis — Gerald of Wales
(1147-1223) — roamed over many lands and topics, mastered many tongues
but not his own, accom- panied Prince John to Ireland, lived there two
years, toured Wales to preach the Third Crusade, and wrote four
vivacious books on the two countries. He weighed down his pages with
bias and miracles, but lightened them with vivid accounts of persons and
places, and lively gossip of the trivial things that make the color of a
character or an age. He was sure that his works would immortalize him,
88 but he underestimated the forgetfulness of time.</p>
<p>He was one of thousands who in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
made a pilgrimage to the East. Maps and routes were drawn to guide them,
and geog- raphy benefited. In 1107-11 Sigurd Jorsalafare, King of
Norway, sailed as a crusader with sixty ships via England, Spain, and
Sicily to Palestine; after fighting Moslems at every opportunity he led
his lessened band to Constantinople, and thence overland through the
Balkans, Germany, and Denmark to Norway; the story of this adventurous
journey forms one of the great Scandinavian sagas. In 1270 Lanzarotte
Malocello rediscovered the Canary Islands, which had been known to
antiquity. About 1 290 Ugolino and Vadino Vivaldo, acording to an un-
verified tradition, set out from Genoa in two galleys to sail around
Africa to India; all hands, it appears, were lost. A famous hoax took
the form of a letter from a mythical “Prester John” ( c . 1150), who
told of his dominions in Central Asia, and gave a fantastic geography of
the Orient. Despite the Crusades, few Christians believed in the
antipodes; St. Augustine considered it “incredible th at a people
inhabits the antipodes, where the sun rises when it sets with us, and
where men walk with their feet toward ours.” 39 An Irish monk,
St. Fergil, had suggested, about 748, the possibility of “another world
and other men under the earth”; 40 Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon
accepted the idea, but it remained the daring concept of a few until
Magellan circumnavigated the globe.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 993</p>
<p>The chief contributions to European knowledge of the Far East were
made by two Franciscan monks. In April 1245 Giovanni de Piano Carpini,
sixty-five and fat, was sent by Innocent IV to the Mongol court at
Karako- rum. Giovanni and his companion suffered in the enterprise every
hardship this side of death. They traveled for fifteen months, changing
horses four times a day. Pledged by the Franciscan rule to eat no meat,
they almost starved among nomads who had hardly any other food to give
them. Gio- vanni’s mission failed, but after his return to Europe he
compiled an account of his journey which is a classic in the literature
of geography — clear, im- personal, matter-of-fact, without a word of
self or complaint. In 1253 Louis IX sent William of Tubruquis (Wilhelm
van Ruysbroeck) to the Creat</p>
<p>Khan to renew the Pope’s sugge stion of an alliance; William brought
back a stern invitation to submit France to the Mongol power; 41 and all
that came of the expedition was William’s excellent account of Mongol
manners and history. Here, for the first time, European geography
learned the sources of the Don and the Volga, the position of Lake
Balkhash, the cult of the Dalai Lama, the settlements of Nestorian
Christians in China, and the distinction of Mongols from Tatars.</p>
<p>The most famous and successful of medieval European travelers in the
Far East were the Polo family of Venetian merchants. Andrea Polo had
three sons — Marco the elder, Niccolo, and Maffeo — all engaged in
Byzantine trade, and living in Constantinople. About 1260 Niccolo and
Maffeo moved to Bokhara, where they remained three years. Thence they
traveled in the train of a Tatar embassy to the court of Kublai Khan at
Shangtu. Kublai sent them back as emissaries to Pope Clement IV; they
took three years to reach Venice, and by that time Clement was dead. In
1271 they started back to China, and Niccolo took with him his boy Marco
the younger, then seven- teen. For three and a half years they traveled
across Asia via Balkh, the Pamir plateau, Kashgar, Khotan, Lop Nor, the
Gobi Desert, and Tangut; when they reached Shangtu Marco was almost
twenty-one. Kublai took a fancy to him, gave him important posts and
missions, and kept the three Poli in China for seventeen years. Then
they sailed back, through three years, via Java, Sumatra, Singapore,
Ceylon, and the Persian Gulf, overland to Trebizond, and by boat to
Constantinople and Venice, where, as all the world knows, no one would
believe the tales “Marco Millions” told of the “gorgeous East.” Fighting
for Venice in 1298, Marco was captured, and was kept for a year in a
Genoese jail; there he dictated his narrative to a fellow prisoner.
Nearly every element in the once incredible story has been verified by
later explora- tion. Marco gave the first description of a trip across
all Asia; the first Euro- pean glimpse of Japan; the first good account
of Pekin, Java, Sumatra, Siam, Burma, Ceylon, the Zanzibar coast,
Madagascar, and Abyssinia. The book was a revelation of the East to the
West. It helped to open new routes to</p>
<p>994 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>commerce, ideas, and arts, and shared in molding the geography that
in- spired Columbus to sail westward to the East.</p>
<p>As the orbit of commerce and travel widened, the science of
cartography crept laboriously back toward the level it had reached in Au
gustus’ days. Navigators prepared portolani — guides to the ports of
trade, with maps, charts, itineraries, and descriptions of the various
harbors; in the hands of the Pisans and Genoese these portolani reached
a high degree of accuracy. The mappae mundi drawn by the monks of this
period are by comparison schematic and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Stimulated by the zoological treatises of Aristotle and the botanical
classic of Theophrastus, the awakening mind of the West struggled to
graduate from legend and Pliny to a science of animals and plants.
Nearly everyone believed that minute organisms, including worms and
flies, were spontane- ously generated from dust, slime, and
putrefaction. “Bestiaries” had almost replaced zoology; since monks did
almost all the writing, the animal world was considered largely in
theological terms, as a storehouse of edifying sym- bolism; and
additional creatures were invented in playful fancy or pious need. Said
Bishop Honorius of Autun in the twelfth century:</p>
<p>The unicorn is a very fierce beast with only one horn. To capture
it</p>
<p>a virgin maid is placed in the field. The unicorn approaches her, and
resting in her lap, is so taken. By the beast Christ is figured; by
the</p>
<p>horn his insuperable strength. . . . Resting in the womb of a virgin,
he was taken by the hunters — i.e., Christ was found in the form of a
man by those who loved him . 42</p>
<p>The most scientific work of medieval biology was Frederick II’s De
arte venandi cum avibus, a 589- page treatise on “the art of hunting
with birds.” It was based partly on Greek and Moslem manuscripts, but
largely on direct observation and experiment; Frederick himself was an
expert falconer. His description of bird anatomy contains a great number
of original contribu- tions; his analysis of the flight and migration of
birds, his experiments on the artificial incubation of eggs and the
operations of vultures show a scientific spirit unique in his age. 43
Frederick illustrated his text with hundreds of drawings of birds,
perhaps from his own hand — drawings “true to life down to the tiniest
details.” 44 The menagerie that he collected was not, as most
contemporaries thought, a whim of bizarre display, but a laboratory for
the direct study of animal behavior. This Alexander was his own
Aristotle.</p>

<p>with a theistic view of the world. Their vitality is suggested near
the outset of this period by the efforts of Oliver of Malmesbury to make
an airplane; in 1065 his contraption was ready, he soared in it from a
high place, and was killed. 45</p>
<p>The science of mechanics produced in the thirteenth century a
remarkable figure, a Dominican monk who anticipated several basic
conceptions of Isaac Newton. Jordanus Nemorarius became the second
General of the Dominican Order in 1222; that such a man could do such
brilliant work in science bears wit- ness — if Albert and Thomas were
not enough — to the intellectual eagerness of the Preaching Friars. In
three mathematical treatises rivaling those of Fibonacci in courage and
influence, he accepted the Hindu numerals, and advanced algebra by
regularly using letters instead of figures for his general formulas. His
Elementa super demonstrationem ponderis studied the component of gravity
along a trajec- tory, and laid down a principle now known as the axiom
of Jordanus: that which can raise a certain weight to a certain height
can raise a weight K times heavier to a height K times less. Another
treatise, De ratione ponderis (perhaps by a pupil), analyzed the notion
of statical moment — the product of a force into its lever arm — and
anticipated modem ideas in the mechanics of the lever and the inclined
plane. 46 A third treatise, ascribed to “the school of Jordanus,” gave
tenta - tive expression to the theory of virtual displacements — a
principle developed by Leonardo da Vinci, Descartes, and John Bernoulli,
and finally formulated by J. Willard Gibbs in the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>The progress of mechanics slowly affected invention. In 1271 Robert
of Eng- land clearly stated the theory of the pendulum clock. In 1288 we
hear of a great clock in a tower at Westminster, and, about the same
time, of similar giants in churches on the Continent; but there is no
certain indication that these were fully mechanical. The first clear
mention of a clock operated by pulleys, weights, and gears is dated
1320. 47</p>
<p>The most successful branch of physics in this period was optics. The
Arabic treatises of al-Haitham, translated into Latin, opened almost a
new world to the West. In an essay on the rainbow Robert Grosseteste,
about 1230, wrote of a</p>
<p>third branch of perspective . . . untouched and unknown among us</p>
<p>until the present time . . . 〔which〕 shows us how to make things
very far off seem very close at hand, and how to make large objects
which are near seem tiny, and how to make distant objects appear as
large as we choose.</p>
<p>These marvels, he adds, can be achieved through breaking up “the
visual ray” by passing it through several transparent objects or lenses
of varying structure. These ideas fascinated his pupil Roger Bacon.
Another Franciscan monk, John Peckham, probably also a pupil of
Grosseteste at Oxford, dealt with reflection, refraction, and the
structure of the eye in a treatise Perspec - tiva communis ; when we
recall that Peckham became Archbishop of Can- terbury we perceive again
an unsuspected entente between science and the medieval Church.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>996</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>One result of these studies in optics was the invention of
spectacles. Mag- nifying glasses had been known to Greek antiquity, 48
but the construction of such glasses to focus properly when near the eye
seems to have awaited research in the geometry of refraction. A Chinese
document of uncertain date between 1 260 and 1 300 speaks of glasses
called ai tai, which enabled old people to read fine script. A Dominican
friar, preaching at Piacenza in 1 305, remarked: “It is not twenty years
since there was discovered the art of mak - ing eyeglasses 〔occhiali〕,
which enable one to see well. … I myself have spoken to the man who
first d iscovered and made them.” A letter dated 1 289 says: “I am so
heavy with years that without the glasses called okiali, recently
invented, I should not be able to read or write.” The invention is
usually credited to Salvino d’Amarto, whose tombstone, dated 1317, read:
“the in - ventor of spectacles.” In 1305 a Montpellier physician
announced that he had prepared an eyewash that made spectacles
superfluous. 49</p>
<p>The attractive power of the magnet had also been known to the Greeks.
Its power to indicate direction was apparently discovered by the Chinese
in the first century of our era. Chinese tradition ascribes to Moslems,
about 1093, the earliest use of the magnetic needle in guiding
navigation. Such use was probably widespread among Moslem and Christian
mariners by the end of the twelfth century. The oldest Christian
reference to it is in 1 205, the oldest Moslem reference is in 1 2 8 2 ;
50 but perhaps those who had long known the precious secret had been in
no haste to publish it. Moreover, mariners who used it were suspected of
magic, and some sailors refused to sail with a captain who kept such a
demonic instrument. 51 The first known description of a pivoted floating
compass occurs in an Epistola de magnete by Petrus Peregrinus in 1 269.
This Peter the Pilgrim recorded many experiments, ad- vocated the
experimental method, and expounded the operation of the mag- net in
attracting iron, magnetizing other objects, and finding the north. He
tried also to construct a perpetual motion machine operated by
self-regen- erating magnets. 52</p>
<p>Chemistry advanced largely through alchemical research. From the
tenth century onward Arabic texts in this field were translated into
Latin, and soon the West steamed with alchemy, even in monasteries.
Brother Elias, succes- sor to St. Francis, edited a work on alchemy for
Frederick II; another Fran- ciscan, Grosseteste, wrote in favor of the
possibility of transmuting metals; and one of the most famous of
medieval books, the Liber de causis, presented alchemy and astrology in
a work foisted upon Aristotle. Several European kings employed
alchemists in the hope of rescuing their treasuries by chang- ing cheap
metals into gold. 58 Other zealots continued the search for the elixir
of life and the philosop her’s stone. In 1 307 the Church condemned
alchemy as a diabolical art, but its practice continued. Perhaps to
escape ecclesiastical censure several authors of the twelfth or
thirteenth century attributed their works on alchemy to the Moslem
“Gebir.”</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 997</p>
<p>Medical experience with drugs added to chemical knowledge, and indus-
trial operations almost compelled experiment or discovery. The brewing
of beer, the manufacture of dyes, pottery, enamels, glass, glue,
lacquer, ink, and cosmetics contributed to the science of chemistry.
Peter of St. Omer, about 1270, composed a Liber de coloribus faciendis,
containing recipes for the various pigments used in painting; one recipe
described the making of oil colors by mixing the pigment with linseed
oil. 64 About 1150a treatise known as the Magister Salernus — presumably
a product of the Salerno school of medicine — mentioned the distillation
of alcohol; this is the first clear refer- ence to that now universal
operation. The grape-producing countries dis- tilled wine, and called
the result aqua vitae, eau de vie, water of life; the North, with less
grapes and bitterer cold, found it cheaper to distill grain. The Celtic
term uisqebeatha, which was shortened into whisky, also meant “water of
life.” 55 Distillation had been known long before to Moslem al -
chemists; but the discovery of alcohol — and, in the thirteenth century,
of mineral acids — vastly enlarged chemical knowledge and industry.</p>
<p>Almost as important in its effects as the distillation of alcohol was
the dis- covery of gunpowder. The old Chinese claim to priority here is
now chal- lenged; and there is no clear mention of the substance in
Arabic manuscripts before 1 300. 56 The earliest known notice of the
explosive is in a Liber ignium ad comburendos hostes, or Book of Fires
for Burning Enemies , written by Marcus Graecus, about 1270. After
describing Greek fire and phosphores- cence Mark the Greek gave a recipe
for making gunpowder: reduce to a fine powder, separately, one pound of
live sulphur, two pounds of charcoal from the lime or willow tree, and
six pounds of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) ; then mix them. 67 There is
no record of any military use of gunpowder before the fourteenth
century.</p>
<p>V. THE REVIVAL OF MEDICINE</p>
<p>Poverty always mingles myth with medicine, for myth is free and
science is dear. The basic picture of medieval medicine is the mother
with her little store of household remedies; old women wise in herbs and
plasters and magic charms; herbalists peddling curative plants,
infallible drugs, and miraculous pills; midwives ready to sever new life
from old in the ridiculous ignominy of birth; quacks ready to cure or
kill for a pittance; monks with a heritage of monastic medicine; nuns
quietly comforting the sick with ministration or prayer; and, here and
there, for those who could afford them, trained physi- cians practicing
more or less scientific medicine. Monstrous drugs and fabu- lous
formulas flourished; and just as certain stones held in the hand were by
some believed to ward off conception, so — even in medical Salerno —
some women and men ate asses’ dung to promote fertility. 68</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>998</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>Until 1139 some members of the clergy practiced medicine, and what
hos- pitalization could be had was usually to be found in monastic or
conventual infirmaries. The monks played an honorable role in preserving
the medical heritage, and led the way in the cultivation of medicinal
plants; and perhaps they knew what they were doing in mingling miracle
with medicine. Even nuns might be skilled in healing. Hildegarde, the
mystic Abbess of Bingen, wrote a book of clinical medicine — Causae et
curae (c. 1 1 50) — and a book of Subtilitates, marred here and there
with magic formulas, but rich in medical lore. The retirement of old men
or women into monasteries or convents may have been motivated in part by
a desire for continuous medical attendance. As lay medicine developed,
and the love of gain infected monastic healing, the Church (1130, 1339,
1663) progressively forbade the public practice of medicine by the
clergy; and by 1 200 the ancient art was almost completely secular.</p>
<p>Scientific medicine survived the Dark Ages in the West chiefly
through Jewish physicians, who circulated Greco-Arabic medical knowledge
in Christendom; through the Byzantine culture of southern Italy; and
through translations of Greek and Arabic medical treatises into Latin.
Probably the School of Salerno was best situated and prepared to take
advantage of these influences; Greek, Latin, Moslem, and Jewish
physicians taught or studied there; and till the twelfth century it
remained the leading medical institution in Latin Europe. Women studied
nursing and obstetrics at Salerno; 59 mu- lieres Salernitanae were
probably midwives trained in the school. One of the most famous
Salernitan products was an obstetrical treatise of the early twelfth
century, entitled Trotulae curandarum aegritudinum muliebrum — Trotula
on the Cure of Diseases of Women-, in the generally accepted theory
Trotula was a midwife of Salerno. 60 Several important treatises,
covering nearly all branches of medicine, have reached us from the
School of Salerno. One, by Archimatheus, prescribes the proper bedside
manner: the physician must always regard the patient’s condition as
grave, so that a fatal end may not disgrace him, and a cure may add
another marvel to his fame; he should not flirt with the patient’s wife,
daughter, or maidservant; and even if no medicine is necessary he should
prescribe some harmless concoction, lest the patient think the treatment
not worth the fee, and lest nature should seem to have healed the
patient without the physician’s aid. 61</p>
<p>The School of Salerno gave way to the University of Naples after
1268, and little is heard of it thereafter. By that time its graduates
had spread Sal- ernitan medicine through Europe. Good schools of
medicine existed in the thirteenth century at Bologna, Padua, Ferrara,
Perugia, Siena, Rome, Mont- pellier, Paris, and Oxford. In these schools
the three main medical traditions of the Middle Ages — Greek, Arabic,
and Judaic — were merged and absorbed, and the entire medical heritage
was reformulated to become the basis of modern medicine. Ancient methods
of diagnosis by auscultation and uri-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 999</p>
<p>nalysis retained (and retain) their popularity, so that in some
places the urinal became the emblem or signboard of the medical
profession. 62 Ancient methods of treatment by purgation and
bloodletting continued, and in Eng- land the physician was a “leech.”
Hot baths were a favorite prescription; pa - tients traveled to “take
the waters” of mineral springs. Diet was minutely prescribed in nearly
every illness. 63 But drugs abounded. Almost every ele- ment was used as
a cure, from seaweed (rich in iodine), which Roger of Salerno
recommended for goiter in 1180, to gold, which was imbibed to “comfort
sore limbs” 64 — apparently our fashionable treatment for arthritis.
Practically every animal organ found some therapeutic use in the
medieval pharmacopeia — the horns of deer, the blood of dragons, the
bile of vipers, the semen of frogs; and animal excrement was
occasionally prescribed. 65 The most popular of all drugs was theriacum,
a weird mixture composed of some fifty-seven substances, of which the
chief was the flesh of poisonous snakes. Many drugs were imported from
Islam, and kept their Arabic names.</p>
<p>As the supply of trained physicians increased, governments began to
regu- late medical practice. Roger II of Sicily, probably influenced by
old Moslem precedents, restricted the practice of medicine to persons
licensed by the state. Frederick II (1224) required for such practice a
license from the School of Salerno. To obtain it the student had to
survive a three-year course in scientia logicalis — presumably meaning
natural science and philosophy; he had then to study medicine at the
school for five years, pass two examina- tions, and practice for a year
under the supervision of an experienced physi- cian. 66</p>
<p>Every city of any importance paid physicians to treat the poor
without charge. 67 Some cities had a measure of socialized medicine. In
Christian Spain of the thirteenth century a physician was hired by the
municipality to care for a specified part of the population; he made
periodically a medical exami- nation of each person in his territory,
and gave each one advice according to his findings; he treated the poor
in a public hospital, and was obliged to visit every sick person three
times a month; all without charge, except that for any visit above three
in any month he was allowed to ask a fee. For these services the
physician was exempted from taxes, and received an annual sal- ary of
twenty pounds, 68 equivalent to some 000 today.*</p>
<p>As licensed physicians were not numerous in thirteenth-century
Christian Europe, they earned good fees, and had a high social status.
Some amassed considerable fortunes; some became art collectors; several
won an interna- tional reputation. Petrus Hispanus — Peter of Lisbon and
Compostela — mi- grated to Paris and then to Siena, wrote the most
popular medieval handbook of medicine ( Thesaurus pauperum — Treasure of
the Poor) and the best me- dieval discussion of psychology ( De antma) ,
became Pope John XXI in</p>
<p>In the laws of Visigothic Spain the physician was not entitled to a
fee if his patient died.*</p>
<p>IOOO</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>1276, and was crushed to death by a falling ceiling in 1277. The most
famous Christian physician of this period was Arnold of Villanova ( c .
1 2 3 5-1 3 1 1 ) . Bom near Valencia, he learned Arabic, Hebrew, and
Greek, studied medi- cine at Naples, taught it or natural philosophy at
Paris, Montpellier, Barce- lona, Rome, and wrote a great number of works
on medicine, chemistry, astrology, magic, theology, wine making, and the
interpretation of dreams. Made physician to James II of Aragon, he
repeatedly warned the King that unless he protected the poor against the
rich he would go to hell. 70 James loved him nevertheless, and sent him
on many diplomatic missions. Shocked by the misery and exploitation that
he saw in many countries, he became a follower of the mystic Joachim of
Flora, and declared, in letters to princes and prelates, that the
wickedness of the mighty and the luxury of the clergy heralded the
destruction of the world. He was accused of magic and heresy, and was
charged with having alchemically produced ingots of gold for King Robert
of Naples. He was condemned by an ecclesiastical court, but was released
from prison by Boniface VIII. He successfully treated the old Pope for
kidney stones, and received from him a castle at Anagni. He warned
Boniface that unless the Church should be thoroughly reformed the divine
wrath would soon descend upon her; soon thereafter Boniface suffered fa-
mous indignities at Anagni, and died in despair. The Inquisition
continued to pursue Arnold, but kings and popes protected him for their
ailments’ sake, and he died by drowning on a mission from James II to
Clement V. 71</p>
<p>Surgery in this period fought a two-front war against the barbers on
one side and general practitioners on the other. For a long time the
barbers had given enemas, pulled teeth, treated wounds, and let blood.
Surgeons who had received formal medical training protested against the
tonsorial perform- ance of such ministrations, but the law defended the
barbers throughout the Middle Ages. In Prussia till the time of
Frederick the Great it remained one of the duties of the army surgeon to
shave the officers. 72 Partly through this overlapping of functions, the
surgeons were considered inferior to the physi- cians in science and
society; they were looked upon as simple technicians obeying the
directions of the doctor, who usually, before the thirteenth cen- tury,
disdained to practice surgery himself. 73 Surgeons were further discour-
aged by fear of imprisonment or death if their procedures failed; only
the bravest undertook dangerous operations; and most surgeons, before
such an enterprise, required a written guarantee that no harm would come
to them in case of failure. 74</p>
<p>Nevertheless surgery advanced more rapidly in this period than any
other branch of medicine, partly because it was forced to deal with
conditions rather .than theories, partly through plentiful opportunity
to treat the wounds of soldiers. Roger of Salerno, about 1 1 70,
published his Practica chirurgiae, the earliest surgical treatise in the
Christian West; for three cen- turies it remained a classic text. In
1238 Frederick II ordered that a corpse</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 1001</p>
<p>should be dissected in every five-year period at Salerno; 76 such
dissection of cadavers was practiced regularly in Italy after 1 275. 78
In 1 286 a Cremona physician opened a corpse to study the cause of a
current pestilence; this is the first known case of a post-mortem
examination. In 1 266 Teodorico Bor- gognoni, Bishop of Cervia, began a
long struggle of Italian medicine against the Arabic notion that
suppuration must first be encouraged in the treatment of wounds; his
discussion of aseptic treatment is a classic of medieval medi- cine.
Guglielmo Salicetti — William of Saliceto (1210-77) — professor medicine
at Bologna, made notable improvements in his Chirurgia (1275); it
associated surgical diagnosis with a knowledge of internal medicine,
used careful clinical records, showed how to suture divided nerves, and
advocated the knife — as allowing better healing, and leaving less scar
— in preference to the cautery so popular with Moslem practitioners. In
a general treatise — Summa conservations et curationis — William
ascribed chancre and bubo to intercourse with an infected courtesan,
gave a classical description of dropsy as due to hardening and narrowing
of the kidneys, and offered excellent ad- vice on hygiene and diet for
every age of life.</p>
<p>His pupils Henri de Mondeville (i26o?-i32o) and Guido Lanfranchi</p>
<p>(d. 1315) brought the medical lore of Bologna to France. Like
Teodorico, de Mondeville improved asepsis by advocating a return to
Hippocrates’ method of maintaining simple cleanliness in a wound.
Lanfranchi, exiled from Milan in 1 290, went to Lyons and Paris, and
wrote a Chirurgia magna which became the recognized text of surgery at
the University of Paris. He laid down a principle that rescued surgery
from barberism: “No one can be a good physician if he is ignorant of
surgery; and no one can properly per- form operations if he does not
know medicine.” 77 Lanfranchi was the first to use neurotomy for
tetanus, and intubation of the esophagus, and gave the first surgical
description of concussion of the brain. His chapter on injuries of the
head is one of the peaks in the history of medicine.</p>
<p>Surgical sleeping draughts are mentioned by Origen ( 1 8 5-2 54) and
Bishop Hilary of Poitiers ( c . 353). The usual method of anesthesia in
medieval Christendom was by inhaling, and probably drinking, a mixture
based on mandragora (mandrake) , and generally containing also opium,
hemlock, and mulberry juice; mention of this “soporific sponge” occurs
from the ninth century onward. 78 Local anesthesia was induced by a
poultice soaked in a similar solution. The patient was awakened by
applying fennel juice to his nostrils. Surgical instruments had as yet
made no progress since the Greeks. Obstetrics had fallen behind the
practice of Soranus (c. a.d. ioo) and Paul of Aegina ( c . a.d. 640).
Caesarean section was discussed in the literature, but apparently not
practiced. Embryotomy — mutilation of the foetus for re- moval from the
womb — was in many cases performed because the obstetri- cian rarely
understood version. Delivery was accomplished in specially de- signed
chairs. 79</p>

<p>Hospitals were now advanced far beyond anything known in antiquity.
The Greeks had had asklepieia, religious institutions for the treatment
of the sick; the Romans had maintained hospitals for their soldiers; but
it was Chris- tian charity that gave the institution a wide development.
In 369 St. Basil founded at Caesarea in Cappadocia an institution called
after him the Basilias, with several buildings for patients, nurses,
physicians, workshops, and schools. St. Ephraim opened a hospital at
Edessa in 375; others rose through- out the Greek East, and in
specialized variety. The Byzantine Greeks had nosocomia for the sick,
brephotrophia for foundlings, orphanotrophia for orphans, ptochia for
the poor, xenodochia for poor or infirm pilgrims, and gerontochia for
the old. The first hospital in Latin Christendom was founded by Fabiola
at Rome about 400. Many monasteries provided small hospitals, and
several orders of monks — Hospitalers, Templars, Antonines, Alexians —
and nuns arose to care for the sick. Innocent III organized at Rome in 1
204 the hospital of Santo Spirito, and under his inspiration similar
institutions were set up throughout Europe; Germany alone had, in the
thirteenth cen- tury, over a hundred such “hospitals of the Holy
Spirit.” In France the hos - pitals served the poor and old and the
pilgrim, as well as the sick; like the monastic centers they offered
hospitality. About 1260 Louis IX established at Paris an asylum, Les
Quinze-vingt-, originally a retreat for the blind, it became a hospital
for eye diseases, and is now one of the most important medical centers
in Paris. The first English hospital known to history (not necessarily
the first) was established at Canterbury in 1084. Usually the serv- ice
in these hospitals was provided free for those who could not pay, and
(except in monastic hospitals) the attendants were nuns. The apparently
cumbersome costume of these “angels and ministers of grace” took form in
the thirteenth century, probably to protect them from communicable dis-
ease; hence, perhaps, the shearing of the hair and the covering of the
head. 80</p>
<p>Two special diseases evoked special defenses. “St. Anthony’s fire”
was a skin ailment — perhaps erysipelas — so severe that an order of
monks, the Con- gregation of the Antonines, was founded about 1095 to
treat its victims. Leper hospitals are mentioned by Gregory of Tours ( c
. 560) ; the Order of St. Lazarus was organized to serve in these
leprosaria. Eight diseases were regarded as contagious: bubonic plague,
tuberculosis, epilepsy, scabies, ery- sipelas, anthrax, trachoma, and
leprosy. A victim of any of these was for- bidden to enter a city except
under segregation; or to engage in selling food or drink. The leper was
required to give warning of his approach by horn or bell. Usually his
disease expressed itself in purulent eruptions on face and body. It was
only mildly contagious, but probably medieval authorities feared that it
could be spread by coitus. Possibly the term was used to in- clude what
would now be diagnosed as syphilis; but there is no certain ref- erence
to syphilis before the fifteenth century. 81 No special provision seems
to have been made for the care of the insane before the fifteenth
century.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOO3</p>
<p>The Middle Ages, too poor to be clean or properly fed, suffered more
than any other known period from epidemics. The “Yellow Plague” devas -
tated Ireland in 550 and 664, killing, we are unreliably informed, two
thirds of the population. 82 Similar pestilences struck Wales in the
sixth century, England in the seventh. A malady known to the French as
mal des ardents — which was described as burning out the intestines —
swept through France and Germany in 994, 1043, 1089, and 1130. P lagues
of “leprosy” and scurvy may have come from returning Crusaders. The
plica polonica, a disease of the hair, was apparently brought to Poland
by the Mongol invasion of 1287. The harassed population ascribed these
epidemics to famines, droughts, swarms of insects, astral influences,
poisoning of wells by Jews, or the wrath of God; the likelier causes
were the crowded condition of the small walled towns, poor sanitation
and hygiene, and a consequent lack of defense against infections carried
by returning soldiers, pilgrims, or students. 83 We have no mortality
statistics for the Middle Ages, but it is probable that not more than
half of those born reached maturity. The fertility of women labors to
atone for the stupidity of men and the bravery of generals.</p>
<p>Public sanitation improved in the thirteenth century, but never in
the Middle Ages did it regain its excellence under Imperial Rome. Most
cities and wards appointed officials to care for the streets, 84 but
their work was primitive. Moslem visitors to Christian towns complained
— as Christian vis- itors now to Moslem towns — of the filth and smell
of the “infidel cities.” 85 At Cambridge, now so beautiful and clean,
sewage and offal ran along open gutters in the streets, and “gave out an
a bominable stench, so . . . that many masters and scholars fell sick
thereof.” 86 In the thirteenth century some cities had aqueducts,
sewers, and public latrines; in most cities rain was re- lied upon to
carry away refuse; the pollution of wells made typhoid cases numerous;
and the water used for baking and brewing was usually — north of the
Alps — drawn from the same streams that received the sewage of the
towns. 87 Italy was more advanced, largely through its Roman legacy, and
through the enlightened legislation of Frederick II for refuse disposal;
but malarial infection from surrounding swamps made Rome unhealthy,
killed many dignitaries and visitors, and occasionally saved the city
from hostile armies that succumbed to fever amid their victories.</p>

<li>ALBERTUS MAGNUS: II93-I280</li>
</ol>
<p>Three men stand out in this period as devotees of science: Adelard of
Bath, Albert the Great, and Roger Bacon.</p>
<p>Adelard, after studying in many Moslem countries, returned to England
and wrote ( c . 1 1 30) a long dialogue, Quaestiones natwrales, covering
many sciences. It begins Platonically by describing Adelard’s reunion
with his</p>
<p>1004 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>friends. He asks about the state of affairs in England; he is told
that the kings make war, judges take bribes, prelates drink too much,
all promises are broken, all friends are envious. He accepts this as a
genial summary of the natural and unchangeable condition of things, and
proposes to forget it. His nephew inquires what has Adelard learned
among the Moslems? He expresses a general preference for Arabic as
against Christian science; they challenge him; and his replies
constitute an interesting selection from all the sciences of the age. He
inveighs against the bondage of tradition and aut hority. “I learned
from my Arabian masters under the leading of reason; you, how- ever,
captivated by . . . authority, follow your halter. For what else should
authority be called than a halter?” Those who are now counted as authori
- ties gained their reputation by following reason, not authority.
“Therefore,” he tells his nephew, “if you want to hear anything more
from me, give and take reason. . . . Nothing is surer than reason . . .
nothing is falser than the senses .” 88 Though Adelard relies too
confidently on deductive reasoning, he gives some interesting replies.
Asked how the earth is upheld in space, he answers that the center and
the bottom are the same. How far would a stone fall if dropped into a
hole bored through the center of the earth to the other side? — he
answers, Only to the center of the earth. He states clearly the
indestructibility of matter, and argues that universal continuity makes
a vacuum impossible. All in all, Adelard is a brilliant proof of the
awakening intellect in Christian Europe in the twelfth century. He was
enthusiastic about the possibilities of science, and proudly calls his
age — the age of Abe- lard — modernus, 89 the climax of all history.</p>
<p>Albertus Magnus had a little less of the scientific spirit than
Adelard, but so cosmic a curiosity that the very immensity of his
product won him the name Great. His scientific, like his philosophical,
works took mostly the form of commentaries on the corresponding
treatises of Aristotle, but they contain now and then fresh breaths of
original observation; amid a cloud of quotations from Greek, Arabic, and
Jewish authors he finds some oppor- tunities to look at nature in the
first person. He visited laboratories and mines, studied diverse metals,
examined the fauna and flora of his native Germany, noted displacements
of land by sea, sea by land, and explained thereby the fossil shells in
rocks. Too much of a philosopher to be a thorough scientist, he allowed
a priori theories to color his vision, as when he claimed to have seen
horsehairs in water change into worms. But, like Adelard, he rejected
the explanation of natural phenomena in terms of the will of God; God
acts through natural causes, and man must seek Him there.</p>
<p>His notion of experiment was obscured by his confidence in Aristotle.
A famous passage in Book X of his De vegetabilibus stirs us with the
words Experimentum solum certificat, which seems to say that “only
experiment gives certainty.” But the word experimentum had then a
broader meaning than now; it meant experience rather than experiment ,
as appears from the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOOJ</p>
<p>context of the passage: “All that is here set down is the result of
our own</p>
<p>He yielded to his times in accepting astrology and divination. He
attrib- utes marvelous powers to gems and stones, and claims to have
seen with his own eyes a sapphire that cured ulcers. He thinks, like
undoubting Thomas, that magic is real, and is due to demons. Dreams
sometimes foretell events. In corporeal matters “the stars are in truth
rulers of the world”; the con- junctions of the planets probably explain
“great accidents and great prodi - gies”; and comets may signify wars
and the death of kings. “There is in man a double spring of action —
nature, and the will; the nature is ruled by the stars, the will is
free; but unless the will resists it is swept along by nature.” He
believes that competent astrologers may in considerable measure proph-
esy the events of a man’s life, or the issue of an enterprise, from the
position of the stars. He accepts, with certain reserves, the alchemic
(today the nu- clear physicist) theory of the transmutation of elements
. 92</p>
<p>His best scientific work was in botany. He was the first botanist
since Theophrastus (so far as we know) to consider plants for their own
sake instead of for their use in agriculture or medicine. He classified
plants, de- scribed their color, odor, parts, and fruit, studied their
feeling, sleep, sex, and germination, and ventured an essay on
husbandry. Humboldt was sur- prised to find in Albert’s De vegetabilibus
“exceedingly acute remarks on the organic structure and physiology of
plants .” 93 His enormous work De animalibus is largely a paraphrase of
Aristotle, but here, too, we find orig- inal observation. Albert tells
of “sailing the North Sea for the sake of research 〔experimenti
causa〕, and landing on islands and sandy shores to collect” objects for
study . 94 He compared similar organs in animals and man . 95</p>
<p>From the vantage point of our hindsight these works contain many mis-
takes; viewed against the intellectual background of their time they are
among the major achievements of the medieval mind. Albert was recognized
in his own lifetime as the greatest teacher of his age, and he lived
long enough to be quoted as an authority by men like Peter of Spain and
Vincent of Beauvais, who both died before him. He could not rival
Averroes or Mai- monides or Thomas in keenness of judgment or
philosophic grasp; but he was the greatest naturalist of his time.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>VH. ROGER BACON: C. 1214-92</p>
<p>The most famous of medieval scientists was born in Somerset about
1214. We know that he lived till 1292, and that in 1267 he called
himself an old man. 96 He studied at Oxford under Grosseteste, and
caught from the great polymath a fascination for science; already in
that circle of Oxford Francis- cans the English spirit of empiricism and
utilitarianism was taking form. He went to Paris about 1 240, but did
not find there the stimulation that Ox- ford had given him; he marveled
that so few Parisian professors knew any learned language besides Latin,
that they gave so little time to science, and so much to logical and
metaphysical disputes that seemed to Bacon crimi- nally useless for
life. He “majored” in medicine, and began to write a treatise on the
relief of old age. To get data he visited Italy, studied Greek in Magna
Graecia, and there became acquainted with some works of Moslem medicine.
In 1251 he returned to Oxford, and joined the teaching staff. He wrote
in 1267 that in the preceding twenty years he had spent “more than ^2000
in the purchase of secret books and instruments,” and in training young
men in languages and mathematics. 97 He engaged Jews to teach him and
his stu- dents Hebrew, and to help him read the Old Testament in the
original. About 1253 he entered the Franciscan Order, but he seems never
to have become a priest.</p>
<p>Sick of the metaphysics of the schools, Bacon gave himself with
passion to mathematics, natural science, and philology. We must not
think of him as a lone originator, a scientific voice crying out in the
scholastic wilderness. In every field he was indebted to his
predecessors, and his originality was the forceful summation of a long
development. Alexander Neckham, Bar- tholomew the Englishman, Robert
Grosseteste, and Adam Marsh had estab- lished a scientific tradition at
Oxford; Bacon inherited it, and proclaimed it to the world. He
acknowledged his indebtedness, and gave his predecessors unmeasured
praise. He recognized also his debt — and the debt of Christen- dom — to
Islamic science and philosophy, and through these to the Greeks, and
suggested that the “heathen” savants of Greece and Islam had also, in
their own fashion, been inspired and guided by God. 98 He had a high
regard for Isaac Israeli, Ibn Gabirol, and other Hebrew thinkers, and
had the cour- age to say a good word for the Jews who lived in Palestine
at the time of the crucifixion of Christ. 99 He learned avidly not only
from learned men, but from any man whose practical knowledge in
handicraft or husbandry could augment his store. He writes with unwonted
humility:</p>
<p>It is certain that never, before God is seen face to face, shall a
man</p>
<p>know anything with final certainty. … For no one is so learned in</p>
<p>nature that he knows all … the nature and properties of a single
fly.</p>
<p>. . . And since, in comparison with what a man knows, those things
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOO7</p>
<p>which he is ignorant are infinite, and beyond comparison greater and
more beautiful, he is out of his mind who extols himself in regard
to</p>
<p>his own knowledge The wiser men are, the more humbly they are</p>
<p>disposed to receive the instruction of another, nor do they disdain
the simplicity of the teacher, but behave humbly toward peasants,
old</p>
<p>women, and children, since many things are known to the simple
and</p>
<p>unlearned which escape the notice of the wise 1 have learned more</p>
<p>important truths from men of humble station than from all the famous
doctors. Let no man, therefore, boast of his wisdom. 100</p>
<p>He labored with such fervor and haste that in 1 256 his health broke
down; he retired from university life, and for ten years we lose track
of him. Prob- ably in this period he composed some of his minor works —
De speculis com - burentibus (On Burning Glasses), De mirabili pote
state artis et naturae (On the Marvelous Power of Invention and Nature
), and Computus naturalium (Computation of Natural Events ). Now also he
planned his “Principal Work”— Scriptum principale, a one-man
encyclopedia to be in four volumes: (1) grammar and logic; (2)
mathematics, astronomy, and music; (3) nat- ural science — optics,
geography, astrology, alchemy, agriculture, medicine, and experimental
science; and (4) metaphysics and morals.</p>
<p>He had written some scattered portions when what seemed a stroke of
good fortune interrupted his program. In February, 1265, Guy Foulques,
Archbishop of Narbonne, became Pope Clement IV, and carried into the
papacy something of the liberal spirit that had developed in southern
France from the mingling of peoples and creeds. In June he wrote to
Bacon bid- ding him send a “fair copy” of his works, “secretly and
without delay,” and “notwithstanding the prohibition of any prelate, or
any constitution of thy Order.” 101 Bacon set himself feverishly (as may
be seen from the passion of his style) to finish his encyclopedia; then,
in 1267, fearing that Clement might die or lose interest before its
completion, he put it aside, and composed in twelve months — or put
together from his manuscripts — the preliminary treatise which we known
as the Opus maius , or Larger Work . Suspecting that even this would
prove too long for a busy Pope, he wrote a synopsis of it, an Opus
?ninus, or Smaller Work . Early in 1268 he sent these two manuscripts to
Clement, with an essay De multiplicatione specierum (On the
Multiplication of Vision ). Worried lest these be lost in transit, he
com- posed still another summary of his ideas, an Opus tertium , and
sent it to Clement by special messenger, together with a lens with
which, he suggested, the Pope might himself make experiments. Clement
died in November, 1268. So far as we know, no word of acknowledgment
from him or his successors ever reached the eager philosopher.</p>
<p>The Opus maius , therefore, is now for us literally his “major
work,”</p>
<p>though in his intention it was but a prelude. It is substantial
enough. Its 800 pages are divided into seven treatises: (1) on ignorance
and error; (2) the</p>
<p>1008 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>relations between philosophy and theology; (3) the study of foreign
lan- guages; (4) the usefulness of mathematics; (5) perspective and
optics; (6) experimental science; (7) moral philosophy. The book
contains its due quota of nonsense, and many digressions, and too many
extensive quotations from other authors; but it is written with vigor,
directness, and sincerity, and is more readable today than any other
work of medieval science or philosophy. Its excited disorder, its
adulation of the papacy, its anxious professions of orthodoxy, its
reduction of science and philosophy to the role of servants to theology,
are understandable in a book of such scope and subject, written in hasty
summary, and designed to win papal support for scientific education and
research. For Roger, like Francis, Bacon felt that the advancement of
learning would need the aid and money of prelates and magnates for
books, instruments, records, laboratories, experiments, and
personnel.</p>
<p>As if anticipating the “idols” denounced by his namesake three
centuries later, Roger begins by listing four causes of human error: the
“example of frail and unworthy authority, long-established custom, the
sense of the ignorant crowd, and the hiding of o ne’s ignorance under
the show of wis - dom.” 102 He takes care to add that he is “in no way
speaking of that solid and sure authority which … has been bestowed upon
the Church.” He regrets the readiness of his time to consider a
proposition proved if it can be found in Aristotle, and declares that if
he had the power he would burn all the books of the Philosopher as a
fountain of error and a stream of ig- norance; 103 after which he quotes
Aristotle on every second page.</p>
<p>“After the four causes of error have been banished to the lower
regions,” he writes at the outset of Part II, “I wish to show that there
is one wisdom which is perfect, and that this is contained in the
Scriptures.” If the Greek philosophers enjoyed a sort of secondary
inspiration, it was because they read the books of the prophets and
patriarchs. 104 Bacon apparently accepts the Biblical story with simple
faith, and wonders why God no longer allows men to live 600 years. 105
He believes in the approaching advent of Christ and end of the world. He
pleads for science as revealing the Creator in the creation, and as
enabling Christians to convert heathens immune to Scripture. So “the
human mind can be influenced to accept the truth of the Virgin Birth,
because certain animals in a state of virginity conceive and bear young,
as for example vultures and apes, as Ambrose states in the Hexaemeron.
Moreover, mares in many regions conceive by virtue of the winds alone,
when they desire the male, as Pliny states” 106 — unlucky in- stances of
trust in authority.</p>
<p>In Part III Bacon labors to teach the Pope Hebrew. The study of
lan-</p>
<p>guages is necessary to theology, philosophy, and science, for no
translation conveys the precise sense of the Scriptures or the heathen
philosophers. In the Opus minus Bacon gives a remarkably learned account
of the various</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOO9</p>
<p>translations of the Bible, and shows an intimate acquaintance with
the He- brew and Greek texts. He proposes that the Pope appoint a
committee of scholars learned in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin to revise the
Vulgate, and that this revised version — and no longer the Sentences of
Peter Lombard — be made the main study in theology. He urges the
establishment of univer- sity professorships in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic,
and Chaldean. He denounces the use of force in converting
non-Christians, and asks how the Church can deal with Greek, Armenian,
Syrian, Chaldean Christians except through their own languages. In this
field Bacon labored as well as preached; he was the first scholar in
Western Christendom to complete a Greek grammar for Latin use, and the
first Christian to compose a Hebrew grammar. He claimed ability to write
Greek and Hebrew, and seems also to have studied Arabic . 107</p>
<p>WhenBacon reaches the subject of mathematics his pages become
eloquent with enthusiasm, then recondite with theorems. “Next to
languages I hold mathematics necessary.” He makes his usual obeisance to
theology: math - ematics “should aid us in ascertaining the position of
paradise and hell,” promote our knowledge of Biblical geography and
sacred chronology, and enable the Church to correct the calendar ; 108
and observe, he says, how “the first proposition of Euclid”—
constructing an equilateral triangle on a given line — helps us to
“perceive that if the person of God the Father be granted, a Trinity of
equal persons presents itself .” 109 From this sublimity he pro - ceeds
to a remarkable anticipation of modern mathematical physics, by in-
sisting that though science must use experiment as its method, it does
not become fully scientific until it can reduce its conclusions to
mathematical form. All nonspiritual phenomena are the product of matter
and force; all forces act uniformly and regularly, and may consequently
be expressed by lines and figures; “it is necessary to verify the matter
by demonstrations set forth in geometrical lines”; ultimately all
natural science is mathematics . 110</p>
<p>But though mathematics is the result, experiment must be the means
and test of science. Whereas the Scholastic philosophers from Abelard to
Thomas had put their trust in logic, and had made Aristotle almost a
mem- ber of the Trinity, veritably a holy ghost, Bacon formulates a
scientific revolution in terms of mathematics and experiment. The most
rigorous con- clusions of logic leave us uncertain until they are
confirmed by experience; only a burn really convinces us that fire
burns. “He who wishes to rejoice</p>
<p>IOIO</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>teste, Albertus Magnus, and others had made or lauded experiments.
Roger Bacon made the implicit explicit, and planted the flag of science
firmly on the conquered ground.</p>
<p>Except in optics and calendar reform, Roger, like Francis, Bacon made
only negligible contributions to science itself; they were philosophers
of sci- ence rather than scientists. Continuing the work of Grosseteste
and others, Roger concluded that the Julian calendar exaggerated the
length of the solar year by one day every 125 years — the most accurate
computation thereto- fore made — and that the calendar, in 1267, was ten
days ahead of the sun. He proposed that a day be dropped from the Julian
calendar every 125 years. Almost as brilliant were the hundred pages on
geography in Part IV of the Opus maius. Bacon talked eagerly with
William of Rubruquis on the return of his fellow Franciscan from the
Orient, learned much from him about the Orient, and was impressed by
William’s account of the unnum - bered millions who had never heard of
Christianity. Starting from statements in Aristotle and Seneca, he
remarked that “the sea between the end of Spain on the west and the
beginning of India on the east is navigable in a very few days if the
wind is favorable.” 113 This passage, copied in the Imago mundi (1480)
of Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly, was cited by Columbus in a letter to
Ferdinand and Isabella in 1498 as one of the suggestions that had
inspired his voyage of 149 2. 114</p>
<p>Bacon’s work in physics is a vision of modern inventions, colored now
and then with the popular ideas of his time. Here, in literal
translation, are the famous passages in which he leaps from the
thirteenth to the twentieth century:</p>
<p>A fifth part of experimental science concerns the fabrication of
in-</p>
<p>struments of wonderfully excellent usefulness, such as machines for
flying, or for moving in vehicles without animals and yet with incom-
parable speed, or of navigating without oarsmen more swiftly than</p>
<p>would be thought possible through the hands of men. For these things
have been done in our day, lest anyone should ridicule them or be</p>
<p>astonished. And this part teaches how to make instruments by which
incredible weights can be raised or lowered without difficulty or</p>
<p>labor. . . , 115 Flying machines can be made, and a man sitting in
the middle of the machine may revolve some ingenious device by which
artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird. . .
.</p>
<p>Also machines can be made for walking in the sea and the rivers, even
to the bottom, without danger. 116</p>
<p>A passage in the Opus maius (vi, 12) has been interpreted as
referring to gunpowder:</p>
<p>Important arts have been discovered against foes of the state, so
that without a sword or any weapon requiring physical contact they could
destroy all who offer resistance From the force of the salt called</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE lOI I</p>
<p>saltpeter so horrible a sound is produced at the bursting of so small
a thing, namely, a small piece of parchment, that … it exceeds the roar
of sharp thunder, and the flash exceeds the greatest brilliancy of the
lightning accompanying the thunder.</p>
<p>In a possibly interpolated passage of the Opus tertium Bacon adds
that cer- tain toys, “crackers,” are already in use, containing a
mixture of saltpeter</p>
<p>The best work of Bacon is Part V of the Opus maius, “On Perspectival
Science,” and in the supplementary treatise On the Multip lication of
Vision. This brilliant essay on optics stemmed from Grosseteste’s work
on the rain - bow, from Witelo’s adaptation of al -Haitham, and from the
tradition of optical studies mounting through Avicenna, al-Kindi, and
Ptolemy to Eu- clid (300 b.c.), who had ingeniously applied geometry to
the movements of light. Is light an emanation of particles from the
object seen, or is it a movement of some medium between the object and
the eye? Bacon believed that every physical thing radiates force in all
directions, and that these rays may penetrate solid objects:</p>
<p>No substance is so dense as altogether to prevent rays from pass-</p>
<p>ing. Matter is common to all things, and thus there is no substance
on which the actions involved in the passage of a ray may not
produce</p>
<p>a change. . . . Rays of heat and sound penetrate through the walls of
a vessel of gold or brass. It is said by Boethius that a lynx’s eye
will</p>
<p>pierce thick walls. 118</p>
<p>We are not so sure of the lynx, but otherwise we must applaud the
bold fancy of the philosopher, “of imagination all compact.”
Experimenting with lenses and mirrors, Bacon sought to formulate the
laws of refraction, reflec- tion, magnification, and microscopy.
Recalling the power of a convex lens to concentrate many rays of the sun
at one burning point, and to spread the rays beyond that point to form a
magnified image, he wrote:</p>
<p>We can so shape transparent bodies 〔lenses〕, and arrange them
in</p>
<p>such a way with respect to our sight and the objects of vision, that
the rays will be refracted and bent in any direction we desire; and
under any angle we wish we shall see the object near or at a distance.
Thus from an incredible distance we might read the smallest letters,
and</p>
<p>number grains of dust or sand. . . . Thus a small army might
appear</p>
<p>very large and . . . close at hand. … So also we might cause the
sun,</p>

<p>their length and breadth on a corporeal figure moving with their</p>

120</p>
<p>These are brilliant passages. Almost every element in their theory
can be found before Bacon, and above all in al-Haitham; but here the
material was brought together in a practical and revolutionary vision
that in time trans- formed the world. It was these passages that led
Leonard Digges (d. c. 1571) to formulate the theory on which the
telescope was invented. 121</p>
<p>But what if the progress of physical science gives man more power
with- out improving his purpo ses? Perhaps the profoundest of Bacon’s
insights is his anticipation of a problem that has become clear only in
our time. In the concluding treatise of the Opus maius he expresses the
conviction that man cannot be saved by science alone.</p>
<p>All these foregoing sciences are speculative. There is, indeed,
in</p>
<p>every science a practical side. . . . But only of moral philosophy
can</p>
<p>it be said that it is . . . essentially practical, for it deals with
human</p>
<p>conduct, with virtue and vice, with happiness and misery. . . .
All</p>
<p>other sciences are of no account except as they help forward
right</p>
<p>action. In this sense “practical” sciences, such as experiment,
chemis - try ( alkimia ), and the rest, are seen to be speculative in
reference to the operations with which moral or political science is
concerned.</p>
<p>This science of morality is the mistress of every department of
phi-</p>
<p>losophy. 122</p>
<p>Bacon’s final word is not for science but for religion; only by a
morality supported by religion can man save himself. But which religion
should it be? He tells of the parliament of religions — Buddhist,
Mohammedan, Chris- tian — which William of Rubruquis reported to have
been held at Karakorum at the suggestion and under the presidency of
Mangu Khan. 128 He compares the three religions, and concludes in favor
of Christianity, but with no merely theological conception of its
function in the world. He felt that the papacy, despite Grosseteste’s
criticisms, was the moral bond of a Europe that with - out it would be a
chaos of clashing faiths and arms; and he aspired to strengthen the
Church with science, languages, and philosophy for her better spiritual
government of the world. 124 He ended his book as he had begun it, with
a warm profession of fidelity to the Church, and concluded with a
glorification of the Eucharist — as if to say that unless man seeks
periodical communion with his highest ideal he will be lost in the
conflagration of the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps the failure of the popes to respond in any way to Bacon’s
program and appeals darkened his spirit and embittered his pen. In 1271
he published an unfinished Compendium studii philosophiae, which
contributed little to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOI3</p>
<p>philosophy, but much to the odium theologicum that was disordering
the schools. He settled summarily the subsiding debate between realism
and nominalism: “a universal is nothing but the similarity of several
individuals,” and “one individual has more reality than all universals
put together.” 125 He adopted Au gustine’s doctrine of rationes
seminales, and arrived at a view in which the efforts of all things to
better themselves engendered a long series of developments. 126 He
accepted the Aristotelian notion of an Active Intellect or Cosmic
Intelligence “flow ing into our minds and illuminating them,” and came
dangerously near to Averroistic pantheism. 127</p>
<p>But what shocked his time was not his philosophical ideas so much as
his attacks upon his rivals and the morals of the age. In the Compendium
philosophiae almost every phase of thirteenth-century life felt his
lash: the disorder of the papal court, the degeneration of the monastic
orders, the ignorance of the clergy, the dullness of sermons, the
misconduct of students, the sins of the universities, the windy verbiage
of the philosophers. In a Tractatus de erroribus medicorum he listed
“thirty -six great and radical de- fects” in the medical theory and
practice of his time. In 1271 he wrote a passage that may incline us to
take with better grace the shortcomings of our age:</p>
<p>More sins reign in these days than in any past age . . . the Holy
See</p>
<p>is tom by the deceit and fraud of unjust men. . . . Pride reigns,
covet- ousness burns, envy gnaws upon all; the whole Curia is disgraced
with lechery, and gluttony is lord of all. … If this be so in the Head,
what</p>
<p>then is done among the members? Let us see the prelates, how they run
after money, neglect the care of souls, promote their nephews and other
carnal friends, and crafty lawyers who ruin all by their coun-</p>
<p>sel Let us consider the Religious Orders; I exclude none from
what</p>
<p>I say; see how far they are fallen, one and all, from their right
state;</p>
<p>and the new Orders 〔the Friars〕 are already horribly decayed
from</p>
<p>their original dignity. The whole clergy is intent upon pride,
lechery, and avarice; and wheresoever clerks 〔students〕 are gathered
together . . . they scandalize the laity with their wars and quarrels
and other</p>
<p>vices. Princes and barons and knights oppress one another, and
trouble their subjects with infinite wars and exactions. . . . The
people, har-</p>
<p>assed by their princes, hate them, and keep no fealty save under com-
pulsion; corrupted by the evil example of their betters, they oppress
and circumvent and defraud one another, as we see everywhere with our
eyes; and they are utterly given over to lechery and gluttony, and are
more debased than tongue can tell. Of merchants and craftsmen there is
no question, since fraud and deceit and guile reign beyond all measure
in their words and deeds. . . . The ancient philosophers,</p>
<p>though without that quickening grace which makes men worthy of</p>
<p>eternal life, lived beyond all comparison better than we, both in de-
cency and in contempt of the world with all its delights and riches
and</p>
<p>1014 THF, AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>honors, as all men may read in the works of Aristotle, Seneca, Tully,
Avicenna, al-Farabi, Plato, Socrates, and others; and so it was that
they attained to the secrets of wisdom and found out all knowledge. But
we Christians have discovered nothing worthy of those philosophers, nor
can we even understand their wisdom; which ignorance of ours</p>
<p>springs from this cause, that our morals are worse than theirs. . .
.</p>
<p>There is no doubt whatever among wise men but that the Church</p>
<p>must be purged. 128</p>
<p>He was not impressed by his contemporaries in philosophy; not one of
them, he wrote to Clement IV, could in ten years write such a book as
the Opus maius; their tomes seemed to Bacon a mass of voluminous
superfluity and “ineffable falsity”; 129 and the whole structure of
their thought rested upon a Bible and an Aristotle mistranslated and
misunderstood. 130 He ridiculed Thomas’ long discussion of the habits,
powers, intelligence, and movements of the angels. 131</p>
<p>Such an exaggerated indictment of European life, morals, and thought
in a brilliant century must have left Bacon alone against the world.
Neverthe- less there is no evidence that his Order or the Church
persecuted him, or interfered with his freedom of thought or utterance,
before 1277 — i.e., six years after the issuance of the above Jeremiad.
But in that year John of Ver- celli, head of the Dominicans, and Jerome
of Ascoli, head of the Franciscans, conferred to allay certain quarrels
that had arisen between the two orders. They agreed that the friars of
each order should abstain from criticizing the other, and that “any
friar who was found by word or deed to have offended a friar of the
other order should receive from his provincial such punish- ment as
ought to satisfy the offended brother.” 132 Shortly thereafter Jerome,
according to the fourteenth-century Franciscan Chronicle of the XXIV
Generals of the Order, “acting on the advice of many friars, condemned
and reprobated the teaching of Friar Roger Bacon, master of sacred
theol- ogy, as containing some suspected novelties, on account of which
the same Roger was condemned to prison.” 133 We have no further
knowledge of the matter. Whether the “novelties” were heresies, or
reflected a suspicion that he dabbled in magic, or covered up a decision
to silence a critic offensive to Dominicans and Franciscans alike, we
cannot say. Nor do we know how severe were the conditions of Bacon’s
imprisonment, nor how long it lasted. We are told that in 1292 certain
prisoners condemned in 1277 were freed. Presumably Bacon was released
then or before, for in 1292 he published a Compendium studii theologiae.
Thereafter we have only an entry in an old chronicle: “The noble doctor
Roger Bacon was buried at the Grey Friars” (the Franciscan church) “in
Oxford in the year 1292.” 134</p>
<p>He had little influence on his time. He was remembered chiefly as a
man of many marvels, a magician and conjurer; it was as such that he was
pre- sented in a play by Robert Greene 300 years after his death. It is
hard to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOI5</p>
<p>say how much Francis Bacon (1561 — 1626) owed to him; we can only
note that the second Bacon, like the first, rejected Aristotelian logic
and Scholas- tic method, quest ioned authority, custom, and other
“idols” of traditional thought, praised science, listed its expected
inventions, charted its program, stressed its practical utility, and
sought financial aid for scientific research. Slowly, from that
sixteenth centur y, Roger Bacon’s fame grew, until he became a legend —
the supposed inventor of gunpowder, the heroic free- thinker, the
lifelong victim of religious persecution, the great initiator of modern
thought. Today the pendulum returns. Historians point out that he had
only a confused idea of experiment; that he did little experimenting
himself; that in theology he was more orthodox than the pope; that his
pages were peppered with superstitions, magic, misquotations, false
charges, and legends taken for history.</p>
<p>It is true. It is also true that though he made few experiments he
helped to state their principle and to prepare their coming; and that
his protesta- tions of orthodoxy may have been the diplomacy of a man
seeking papal support for suspected sciences. His errors were the
infection of his time or the haste of a spirit too eager to take all
knowledge for its province; his self- praise was the balm of genius
ignored; his denunciations the wrath of a frus- trated Titan helplessly
witnessing the submergence of his noblest dreams in an ocean of
ignorance. His attack on authority in philosophy and science opened the
way to wider and freer thought; his emphasis on the mathemat- ical basis
and goal of science was half a millennium ahead of his age; his warn-
ing against subordinating morality to science is a lesson for tomorrow.
With all its faults and sins, his Opus maius deserves its name as a work
greater than any other in all the literature of its amazing century.</p>

<li>THE ENCYCLOPEDISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Intermediate between science and philosophy were the reckless
polymaths who sought to give order and unity to the expanding knowledge
of their period, to bring science and art, industry and government,
philosophy and religion, literature and history into an orderly whole
that might provide a base for wisdom. The thirteenth century excelled in
encyclopedias, and in suwmae that were all-encompassing syntheses. The
more modest encyclope- dists limited themselves to summarizing natural
science. Alexander Neckarn, Abbot of Cirencester ( c . 1200), and Thomas
of Cantimpre, a French Do- minican ( c . 1244), wrote popular surveys of
science under the title of The Nature of Things; and Bartholomew of
England, a Franciscan, sent forth a chatty volume On the Properties of
Things (c. 1 240) . About 1 266 Brunetto Latini, a Florentine notary
exiled for his Guelf politics, and living for some years in France,
wrote in the langue (Toil Li livres dou tresor ( The Treasure</p>
<p>10x6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>Books), a brief encyclopedia of science, morals, history, and
government. It proved so permanently popular that Napoleon thought of
having a revised edition published by the state, half a century after
the world-shaking Grande Encyclopedic of Diderot. All these works of the
thirteenth century min- gled theology with science, and superstition
with observation; they breathed the air of their time; and we should be
chagrined if we could foresee how our own omniscience will be viewed
seven centuries hence.</p>
<p>The most famous encyclopedia of the Christian Middle Ages was the
Speculum menus of Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1200 -c. 1264). He joined the
Dominican Order, became tutor to Louis IX and his sons, was given charge
of the King’s library, and und ertook, with several aides, the task of
reducing to digestible form the knowledge that encompassed him. He
called his en- cyclopedia Imago mundi, Image of the World, presenting
the universe as a mirror that reflected the divine intelligence and
plan. It was a gigantic com- pilation, equal to forty sizable modern
tomes. Vincent, with copyists and shears, completed three parts —
Speculum naturale, Speculum doctrinale, Speculum historiale; the heirs
of the task added, about 1310, a Speculum morale, large ly “cribbed”
from Thomas’ Summa. Vincent himself was a modest and gentle soul. “I do
not know even a single science,” he said; he disclaimed all originality,
and merely proposed to gather excerpts from 450 authors, Greek, Latin,
or Arabic. He transmitte d Pliny’s errors faithfully, accepted all the
marvels of astrology, and filled his pages with the occult qualities of
plants and stones. Nevertheless the wonder and beauty of nature shine
out now and then through his paste, and he himself feels them as no mere
bookworm could:</p>
<p>I confess, sinner as I am, with mind befouled in flesh, that I am</p>
<p>moved with spiritual sweetness toward the Creator and Ruler of this
world, and honor Him with greater veneration, when I behold the</p>
<p>magnitude and beauty … of His creation. For the mind, lifting
itself</p>
<p>from the dunghill of its affections, and rising, as it is able, into
the light of speculation, sees as from a height the greatness of the
universe con- taining in itself infinite places filled with the diverse
orders of crea-</p>
<p>tures. 135</p>
<p>The outburst of scientific activity in the thirteenth century rivals
the mag- nitude of its philosophies, and the variety and splendor of a
literature ranging from the troubadours to Dante. Like the great summae
and The Divine Com- edy, the science of this age suffered from too great
certainty, from a failure to examine its assumptions, and from an
indiscriminate mingling of knowl- edge with faith. But the little bark
of science, riding an occult sea, made substantial progress even in an
age of faith. In Adelard, Grosseteste, Albert, Arnold of Villanova,
William of Saliceto, Henri de Mondeville, Lan-</p>
<p>franchi, Bacon, Peter the Pilgrim, and Peter of Spain, fresh
observation and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) CHRISTIAN SCIENCE IOI7</p>
<p>timid experiment began to break down the authority of Aristotle,
Pliny, and Galen; a zest for exploration and enterprise filled the sails
of the adven- turers; and already at the beginning of the wonderful
century Alexander Neckam expressed the new devot ion well: “Science is
acquired,” he wrote, “at great expense, by frequent vigils, by great
expenditure of time, by sedu - lous diligence of labor, by vehement
application of mind.” 136</p>
<p>But at the end of Alexander’s book the medieval mood spoke again, at
its best, with timeless tenderness:</p>
<p>Perchance, O book, you will survive this Alexander, and worms</p>
<p>will eat me before the bookworm gnaws you. … You are the mirror</p>
<p>of my soul, the interpreter of my meditations . . . the true witness
of my conscience, the sweet comforter of my grief. ; . . To you as
faith- ful depositary I have confided my heart’s secrets; … in you I
read my - self. You will come into the hands of some pious reader who
will deign to pray for me. Then indeed, little book, you will profit
your mas-</p>
<p>ter; then you will recompense your Alexander by a most grateful in-
terchange. I do not begrudge my labor. There will come the devotion of a
pious reader who will now let you repose in his lap, now move</p>
<p>you to his breast, sometimes place you as a sweet pillow beneath his
head; sometimes, gently closing you, he will fervently pray for me to
Lord Jesus Christ, Who with Father and Holy Spirit lives and reigns</p>
<p>God through infinite cycles of ages. Amen . 137</p>
