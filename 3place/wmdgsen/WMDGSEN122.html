<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>XThe Surrender of Philosophy</p>
<p>T hree strains merged in Greek philosophy: the physical, the
meta-</p>
<p>physical, and the ethical. The physical culminated in Aristotle,
the</p>
<p>metaphysical in Plato, the ethical in Zeno of Citium. The physical
develop- ment ended in the separation of science from philosophy in
Archimedes and Hipparchus; the metaphysical ended in the skepticism of
Pyrrho and the later Academy; the ethical remained until Epicureanism
and Stoicism were conquered or absorbed by Christianity.</p>
<p>I. THE SKEPTICAL ATTACK</p>
<p>Amid this spreading Hellenistic culture Athens — mother of much of
it, mistress of most of it — retained her leadership in two realms: the
drama and philosophy. The world was not too busy with war and
revolutions, new sciences and new religions, the love of beauty and the
quest of gold, to spare some time for the unanswerable but inescapable
problems of truth and error, matter and mind, freedom and necessity,
nobility and baseness, life and death. From all the cities of the
Mediterranean young men made their way, often through a thousand
hardships, to study in the halls and gardens where Plato and Aristotle
had left almost living memories.</p>
<p>At the Lyceum the industrious Theophrastus of Lesbos carried on the
empirical tradition. The Peripatetics were scientists and scholars
rather than philosophers; they devoted themselves to specialist research
in zoology, botany, biography, and the history of science, philosophy,
literature, and law. In his thirty-four years of leadership (322-288)
Theophrastus ex- plored many fields, and published four hundred volumes
dealing with al- most every subject from love to war. His pamphlet “On
Marriage” severely handled the female sex, and was severely handled in
turn by Epicurus’ mis - tress Leontium, who wrote a learned and
devastating reply.’ Nevertheless it is to Theophrastus th at Athenaeus
attributes the tender sentiment that “it is through modesty that beauty
becomes beautiful.’” Diogenes Laertius de - scribes him as “a most
benevolent man, and very affable”; so eloquent that</p>
<p>640</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIX) THE SURRENDER OF PHILOSOPHY 64I</p>
<p>his original name was forgotten in that which Aristotle gave him,
meaning that he spoke like a god; so popular that two thousand students
flocked to his lectures, and Menander was among his most faithful
followers.” Pos - terity preserved with especial care his book of
Characters, not because it created a literary form, but because it
sharply satirized the faults that all men ascribe to other men. Here is
the Garrulous Man who “begins with a eulogy of his wife, relates the
dream he had the night before, tells dish by dish what he had for
supper,” and concludes that “we are by no means the men we were” in
former times. And here is the Stupid Man who “when he goes to the play,
is left at the end fast asleep in an empty house . . . after a hearty
supper he has to get up in the night, returns only half awake, misses
the right door, and is bitten by his neighbor’s dog.”*</p>
<p>One of the few events in Theophrastus’ life was the issuance of a
state</p>
<p>Meanwhile Speusippus had succeeded Plato, and Xenocrates Speusippus,
at the Academy. Xenocrates governed the school for a quarter of a cen-
tury (339-314), and brought new credit to philosophy by the honorable
simplicity of his life. Absorbed in study and teaching, he left the
Academy but once a year, to see the Dionysian tragedies; when he
appeared, says Laertius, “the turbulent and quarrelsome rabble of the
city made way for him to pass.”” He refused all fees, and became so poor
that he was on the verge of being imprisoned for taxes when Demetrius of
Phalerum paid his arrears and had him freed. Philip of Macedon said that
among the many Athenian ambassadors sent to him Xenocrates was the only
one who proved incorruptible. His reputation for virtue annoyed Phryne.
Pretending that she was being pursued, she took refuge in his house; and
seeing that he had but one bed she asked if she might share it with him.
He consented, we are told, out of humane considerations; but he proved
so cold to her entreaties and her charms that she fled from his bed and
board, and complained to</p>
<p>642 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xher friends that she had found a statue instead of a man.*
Xenocrates would have no mistress but philosophy.</p>
<p>With his death the metaphysical strain in Greek thought neared
exhaus- tion in the very grove that had been its shrine. The successors
of Plato were mathematicians and moralists, and spent little time on the
abstract questions that had once agitated the Academy. The skeptical
challenges of Zeno the Eleatic, the subjectivism of Heracleitus, the
methodical doubt of Gorgias and Protagoras, the metaphysical agnosticism
of Socrates, Aristip- pus, and Eucleides of Megara resumed control of
Greek philosophy; the Age of Reason was over. Every hypothesis had been
conceived, aired, and forgotten; the universe had preserved its secret,
and men had grown weary of a search in which even the most brilliant
minds had failed. Aristotle had agreed with Plato on only one point —
the possibility of acquiring ultimate truth.’ Pyrrho voiced the
suspicions of hi s time in suggesting that it was above all on this
point that they had both been mistaken.</p>
<p>Pyrrho was bom at Elis about 360. He followed Alexander’s army to</p>
<p>India, studied under the “Gymnosophists” there, and perhaps learned
from them something of the skepticism for which his name became a
synonym. Returning to Elis he lived in serene poverty as a teacher of
philosophy. He was too modest to write books, but his pupil Timon of
Phlius, in a series of Silloi or Satires, sent Pyrrho’s opinions abroad
in to the world. These opin- ions were basically three: that certainty
is unattainable, that the wise man will suspend judgment and will seek
tranquillity rather than truth, and that, since all theories are
probably false, one might as well accept the myths and conventions of
his time and place. Neitlier the senses nor reason can give us sure
knowledge: the senses distort the object in perceiving it, and reason is
merely the sophist servant of desire. Every syllogism begs the question,
for its major pre mise assumes its conclusion. “Every reason has a
correspond - ing reason opposed to it”;’ the same experience may be
delightful or un - pleasant according to circumstance and mood; the same
object may seem small or large, ugly or beautiful; the same practice may
be moral or immoral according to where and when we live; the same gods
are or are not, accord- ing to the different nations of mankind;
everything is opinion, nothing is quite true. It is foolish, then, to
take sides in disputes, or to seek some other place or mode of living,
or to envy the future or the past; all desire is delu- sion. Even life
is an uncertain good, death not a certain evil; one should have no
prejudices against either of them. Best of all is a calm acceptance: not
to reform the world, but to bear with it patiently; not to fever our-
selves with progress, but to content ourselves with peace. Pyrrho
tried</p>
<p>CHAP.Xnx) THE SURRENDER OF PHILOSOPHY 643</p>
<p>sincerely to live this half-Hindu philosophy. He conformed humbly
with the customs and worship of Elis, made no effort to avoid dangers or
prolong his life,* and died at the age of ninety. His fellow citizens so
approved of him that in his honor they exempted philosophers from
taxation.</p>
<p>By the irony of time it was the followers of Plato who carried
forward this attack upon metaphysics. Arcesilaus, who became head of the
“Middle Academy” in 269, transformed Plato’s rejection of sense
knowledge into a skepticism as complete as Pyrrho’s, and probably under
Pyrrho’s influ - e nce.” “Nothing is certain,” said Arcesilaus, “not
even that.”” When he was told that such a doctrine made life impossible
he answered that life had long since learned to manage with
probabilities. A century later a still more vigorous skeptic took charg
e of the “New Acadepiy,” and pressed the doc - trine of universal doubt
to the point of intellectual and moral nihilism. Cameades of Gyrene,
coming to Athens like a Greek Abelard about 193, made life bitter for
Chrysippus and his other teachers by arguing with galling subtlety
against every doctrine that they taught. As they had undertaken to make
him a logician he used to say to them (turning the tables on
Protagoras): “If my reasoning is right, well and good; if it is wrong,
give me back my tuition fee.”” When he set up shop for himself he
lectured one morning for an opinion, the next morning against it, prov-
ing each so well as to destroy both; while his pupils, and even his
biog- rapher, sought in vain to discover his real views. He undertook to
refute the materialistic realism of the Stoics by a Platonic-Kantian
critique of sen- sation and reason. He attacked all conclusions as
intellectually indefensible, and bade his students be satisfied with
probability and the customs of their time. Sent to Rome by Athens as one
of an embassy (155), he shocked the Senate by speaking one day in
defense of justice, and on the morrow de- riding it as an impracticable
dream: if Rome wished to practice justice it would have to restore to
the nations of the Mediterranean all that it had taken from them by
superior force.” On the third day Cato had the embassy sent home as a
danger to public morals. Perhaps Polybius, who was then a hostage with
Scipio, heard these addresses or of them, for he speaks with the anger
of a practical man against those philosophers</p>
<p>who in the discussions of the Academy have trained themselves in</p>
<p>extreme readiness of speech. For some of them, in their efforts
to</p>
<p>puzzle the minds of their hearers, resort to such paradoxes, and are
so fertile in inventing plausibilities, that they wonder whether or not
it is possible for those in Athens to smell eggs roasted in Ephesus, and
are in doubt whether all the time they are discussing the matter in</p>
<p>644</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xthe Academy they are not lying in their beds at home and composing
this discourse in a dream. • . . From this excessive love of paradox</p>
<p>they have brought all philosophy into disrepute. . . . They have
im-</p>
<p>planted such a passion in the minds of our young men that they never
give even a thought to the ethical and political questions that really
benefit students of philosophy, but spend their lives in the vain
at-</p>
<p>tempt to invent useless absurdities.”</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE EPICUREAN ESCAPE</li>
</ol>
<p>Though he described for many ages the theorist who loses his life in
the cobwebs of speculation, Polybius was wrong in supposing that moral
prob- lems had lost their lure for the Greek mind. It was precisely the
ethical strain that in this period replaced the physical and the
metaphysical as the dominant note in philosophy. Political problems were
indeed in abeyance, for freedom of speech was harassed by the presence
or memory of royal garrisons, and national liberty was implicitly
understood to depend upon quiescence. The glory of the Athenian state
had departed, and philosophy had to face what to Greece was an
unprecedented divorce between politics and ethics. It had to find a way
of life at once forgivable to philosophy and compatible with political
impotence. Therefore it conceived its problem no longer as one of
building a just state, but as that of forming the self- contained and
contented individual.</p>
<p>The ethical development now took two opposite directions. One fol-
lowed the lead of Heracleitus, Socrates, Antisthenes, and Diogenes, and
expanded the Cynic into the Stoic philosophy; the other stemmed from
Democritus, leaned heavily on Aristippus, and drew out the Cyrenaic into
the Epicurean creed. Both of these philosophical compensations for re-
ligious and political decay came from Asia: Stoicism from Semitic
panthe- ism, fatalism, and resignation; Epicureanism from the
pleasure-loving Greeks of the Asiatic coast.</p>
<p>Epicurus was bom at Samos in 341 . At twelve he fell in love with
philoso- phy; at nineteen he went to Athens and spent a year at the
Academy. Like Francis Bacon he preferred Democritus to Plato and
Aristotle, and took from him many bricks for his own construction. From
Aristippus he learned the wisdom of pleasure, and from Socrates the
pleasure of wisdom; from Pyrrho he took the doctrine of tranquillity,
and a ringing word for it — ataraxia. He must have watched with interest
the career of his contemporary Theodorus</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIX) THE SURRENDER OF PHILOSOPHY 645</p>
<p>of Gyrene, who preached an unmoralistic atheism so openly in Athens
that the Assembly inicted him for impiety“ — a lesson that Epicurus did
not for- get. Then he returned to Asia and lectured on philosophy at
Colophon, Mytilene, and Lampsacus. The Lampsacenes were so impressed
with his ideas and his character that they felt qualms of selfishness in
keeping him in so remote a city; they raised a fund of eighty minas
(000), bought a house and garden on the outskirts of Athens, and
presented it to Epicurus as his school and his home. In 306, aged
thirty-five, Epicurus took up his resi- dence there, and taught to the
Athenians a philosophy that was Epicurean in name only. It was a sign of
the growing freedom of women that he wel- comed them to his lectures,
even into the little community that lived about him. He made no
distinctions of station or race; he accepted courtesans as well as
matrons, slaves as well as freemen; his favorite pupil was his own
slave, Mysis. The courtesan Leontium became his mistress as well as his
pupil, and found him as jealous a mate as if he had secured her by due
proc- ess of law. Under his influence she had one child and wrote
several books, whose purity of style did not interfere with her
morals.“</p>
<p>For the rest Epicurus lived in Stoic simplicity and prudent privacy.
His motto was lathe biosas —“Yivt unobtrusively.” He took part dutifully
in the religious ritual of the city, but kept his hands clear of
politics, and his spirit free from the affairs of the world. He was
content with water and a little wine, bread and a little cheese. His
rivals and enemies charged that he gorged himself when he could, and
became abstemious only when over- eating had ruined his digestion. “But
those who speak thus are all wrong,” Diogenes Laerti us assures us; and
he adds: “There are many witnesses of the unsurpassable kindness of the
man to everybody — both his own country, which honored him with statues,
and his friends, who were so numerous that they could not be contained
in whole cities.”” He was devoted to his parents, generous to his
brothers, and gentle to his servants, who joined with him in
philosophical studies.“ His pupils looked upon him, says Seneca, as a
god among men; and after his death their motto was: “Live as though the
ey e of Epicurus were upon thee.”</p>
<p>Between his lessons and his loves he wrote three hundred books. The
ashes of Herculaneum preserved for us some fragments of his central
work, On Nature; Diogenes Laertius, the Plutarch of philosophy, handed
down three of his letters, and late discoveries have added a few more.
Above all, Lucretius enshrined the thought of Epicurus in the greatest
of philosophical poems.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>646</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>XPerhaps already conscious that Alexander’s conquest w as letting
loose upon Greece a hundred mystic cults from the East, Epicurus begins
with the arresting proposition that the aim of philosophy is to free men
from fear — more than anything else, from the fear of gods. He dislikes
religion because, he thinks, it thrives on ignorance, promotes it, and
darkens life with the terror of celestial spies, relentless furies, and
endless punishments. The gods exist, says Epicurus, and enjoy, in some
far-off space among the stars, a serene and deathless life; but they are
too sensible to bother with the affairs of so infinitesimal a species as
mankind. The world is not de- signed, nor is it guided, by them; how
could such divine Epicureans have created so middling a universe, so
confused a scene of order and disorder, of beauty and suffering.? “ If
this disappoints you, Epicurus adds, console yourself with the thought
that the gods are too remote to do you any more harm than good. They
cannot watch you, they cannot judge you, they cannot plunge you into
hell. As for evil gods, or demons, they are the un- happy fantasies of
our dreams.</p>
<p>Having rejected religion, Epicurus goes on to reject metaphysics. We
can know nothing of the suprasensual world; reason must confine itself
to the experience of the senses, and must accept these as the final test
of truth. All the problems that Locke and Leibnitz were to debate two
thousand years later are here settled with one sentence: if knowledge
does not come from the senses, where else can it come from? And if the
senses are not the ultimate arbiter of fact, how can we find such a
criterion in reason, whose data must be taken from the senses?</p>
<p>Nevertheless the senses give us no certain knowledge of the external
world; they catch not the objective thing itself, but only the tiny
atoms thrown off by every part of its surface, and leaving upon our
senses little replicas of its nature and form. If, therefore, we must
have a theory of the world (and really it is not altogether necessary),
we had better accept Democr itus’ view that nothing exists, or can be
known to us, or can even be imagined by us, except bodies and space; and
that all bodies are com- posed of indivisible and unchangeable atoms.
These atoms have no color, temperature, sound, taste, or smell; such
qualities are created by the corpus- cular radiations of objects upon
our sense organs. But the atoms do differ in size, weight, and form; for
only by this supposition can we account for the infini te variety of
things. Epicurus would like to explain the operation of the atoms on
purely mechanical principles; but as he is interested in ethics far more
than in cosmology, and is anxious to preserve free will as the source of
moral responsibility and the prop of personality, he abandons</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) THE SURRENDER OF PHILOSOPHY 647</p>
<p>Democritus in mid-air, and supposes a kind of spontaneity in the
atoms: they swerve a bit from the perpendicular as they fall through
space, and so enter into the combinations that make the four elements,
and through them the diversity of the objective scene.” There are
innumerable worlds, but it is unwise to interest ourselves in them. We
may assume that the sun and the moon are about as large as they appear
to be, and then we can give our time to the study of man.</p>
<p>Man is a completely natural product. Life probably began by spontane-
ous generation, and progressed without design through the natural
selection of the fittest forms.® Mind is only another kind of matter.
The soul is a delicate material substance diff used throughout the
body.” It can feel or act only by means of the body, and dies with the
body’s death. Despite all this we must accept the testimony of our
immediate consciousness that the will is free; else we should be
meaningless puppets on the stage of life. It is better to be a slave to
the gods of the people than to the Fate of the philoso- phers.”</p>
<p>The real function of philosophy, however, is not to explain the
world, since the part can never explain the whole, but to guide us in
our quest of happiness. “That which we have in view is not a set of
systems and vain opinions, but much rather a life exempt from every kind
of disquietude.’”* Over the entrance to the garden of Epicurus was the
inviting legend: “Guest, thou shalt be happy here, for here happiness is
esteemed the high- est good.“ Virtue, in this philosophy, is not an end
in itself, it is only an indispensable means to a happy life.” “It is
not possible to live pleasantly without liv in g prudently, honorably,
and justly; nor to live prudently, honorably, and justly without living
pleasantly.”” The only certain propo - sitions in philosophy are that
pleasure is good, and that pain is bad. Sensual pleasures are in
themselves legitimate, and wisdom will find some room for them; since,
however, they may have evil effects, they need such discrimi- nating
pursuit as only intelligence can give.</p>
<p>When, therefore, we say that pleasure is the chief good we are
not</p>
<p>speaking of the pleasures of the debauched man, or those that lie in
sensual enjoyment . . . but we mean the freedom of the body from</p>
<p>pain, and of the soul from disturbance. For it is not continued
drink- ings and revels, or the enjoyment of female society, or feasts of
fish or other expensive foods, that make life pleasant, but such sober
con- templation as examines the reasons for choice and avoidance, and
puts to flight the vain opinions from which arises most of the
confusion</p>
<p>that troubles the soul.“</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XIn the end, then, understanding is not only the highest virtue, it
is also the highest happiness, for it avails more than any other faculty
in us to avoid pain and grief. Wisdom is the only liberator: it frees us
from bondage to the passions, from fear of the gods, and from dread of
death; it teaches us how to bear misfortune, and how to derive a deep
and lasting pleasure from the simple goods of life and the quiet
pleasures of the mind. Death is not so frightful when we view it
intelligently; the suffering it involves may be briefer and slighter
than that which we have borne time and again during our lives; it is our
foolish fancies of what death may bring that lend to it so much of its
terror. And consider how little is needed to a wise content- fresh air,
the cheapest foods, a modest shelter, a bed, a few books, and a friend.
“Everything natural is easily procured, and only the useless is cost -
ly.”” We should not fret our lives out in realizing every desire that
comes - ness of life” (hedone) rewards him with the greatest of all
goods, which is peace.</p>
<p>This is a likably honest creed. It is encouraging to find a
philosopher who is not afraid of pleasure, and a logician who has a good
word to say for the senses. There is no subtlety here, and no warm
passion for understanding; on the contrary Epicureanism, despite its
transmission of the atomic theory, marks a reaction from the brave
curiosity that had created Greek science and philosophy. The profoundest
defect of the system is its negativity: it thinks of pleasure as freedom
from pain, and of wisdom as an escape from the hazards and fullness of
life; it provides an excellent design for bachelor- hood, but hardly for
a society. Epicurus respected the state as a necessary evil, under whose
protection he might live unmolested in his garden, but he appears to
have cared little about national independence; indeed, his school seems
to have preferred monarchy to democracy, as less inclined to perse-</p>

<p>cute heresy”— an arresting inversion of modern beliefs. Epicurus was
ready to accept any government that offered no hindrance to the
unobtrusive pursuit of wisdom and companionship. He dedicated to
friendship the de- votion that earlier generations had given to the
state. “Of all th e things that wisdom provides for the happiness of the
whole life, by far the most im- portant is friendship.”” The friendships
of the Epicureans were proverbial for their permanence; and the letters
of the master abound in expressions of ardent affection.“ His disciples
returned this feeling with Greek intensity. Young Colotes, on first
hearing Epicurus speak, fell on his knees, wept, and hailed him as a
god.”</p>
<p>For thirty-six years Epicurus taught in his garden, preferring a
school to a family. In the year 270 he was brought down with the stone.
He bore the pains stoically, and on his deathbed found time to think of
his friends. “I write to you on this happy day which is the last of my
life. The obstruction of my bladder, and the internal pains, have
reached the extreme point, but there is marshaled against them the
delight of my mind in thinking over our talks together. Take care of
Metrodorus’ children in a way worthy of your lifelong devotion to me and
to philosophy.”” He willed his property to the school, hoping “that all
those who study philosophy may never be in want … so far as our power to
prevent it may extend.””</p>
<p>He left behind him a long succession of disciples, so loyal to his
memory that for centuries they refused to change a word of his teaching.
His most famous pupil, Metrodorus of Lampsacus, had already shocked or
amused Greece by reducing Epicureanism to the proposition that “all good
things have reference to the belly””— meaning, perhaps, that all
pleasure is physio- logical, and ultimately visceral. Chrysippus
countered by calling the Gas- trology of Archestratus “the metropolis of
the Epicurean philosophy.”” Popularly misunderstood. Epicureanism was
publicly denounced and pri- vately accepted in wide circles throughout
Hellas. So many Hellenizing Jews adopted it that Apikdros was used by
the rabbis as a synonym for apostate.“ In 173 or 155 two Epicurean
philosophers were expelled from Rome on the ground that they were
corrupting youth.“ A century later Qcero ask ed, “Why are there so many
followers of Epicurus?”“ and Lu - cretius composed the fullest and
finest extant exposition of the Epicurean system. The school had
professed adherents until the reign of Constantine, some of them, by
their lives, degrading the name of the master to mean “epicure,” others
faithfully teaching the simple maxims into which he had once condensed
his philosophy: “The gods are not to be feared; death can - not be felt;
the good can be won; all that w^e dread can be conquered.”“</p>

<li>THE STOIC COMPROMISE</li>
</ol>
<p>Since an increasing number of Epicurus’ followers interpreted him as
counseling the pursuit of personal pleasure, the essential problem of
ethics — what is the good life? — had reached not a solution but only a
new formula- tion: how can the natural epicureanism of the individual be
reconciled with the stoicism necessary to the group and the race? — how
can the members of a society be inspired to, or frightened into, the
self-control and self-sacrifice indispensable to collective survival?
The old religion could no longer fulfill this function; the old
city-state no longer lifted men up to self-forgetfulness. Educated
Greeks turned from religion to philosophy for an answer; they called in
philosophers to advise or console them in the crises of life; they asked
from philosophy some world view that would give to human existence a
permanent meaning and value in the scheme of things, and that would
enable them to look without terror upon the certainty of death. Stoicism
is the last effort of classical antiquity to find a natural ethic. Zeno
tried once more to accomplish the task in which Plato had failed.</p>
<p>Zeno was a native of .Citium in Cyprus. The city was partly
Phoenician, chiefly Greek; Zeno is frequently called a Phoenician,
sometimes an Egyp- tian; he was almost certainly of mixed Hellenic and
Semitic parentage.“ Apollonius of Tyre describes him as thin, tall, and
dark; his head was bent to one side, and his legs were weak; Aphrodite,
though Hephaestus was no better, would have surrendered him to Athena.
Having no distractions, he rapidly amassed wealth as a merchant; when he
first came to Athens, we are told, he had over a thousand talents.
According to Diogenes Laertius he was shipwrecked on the Attic coast,
lost his fortune, and anived in Athens, about 3 14, almost destitute.“
Sitting down by a bookseller’s stall he began to read Xenophon’s
Memorabilia, and was soon fascinated by the character of Socrates.
“Where are such men to be found today?” he asked. At that moment Crates,
a Cynic philosopher, passed by. “Follow that man,” the bookseller
advised him. Zeno, aged thirty, enrolled in Crates’ school, and rejoiced
in having discovered philosophy: “I made a prosper ous voy- age,” he
said, “when I was wrecked.”“ Crates was a Theban who had turned over his
fortune of three hundred talents to his fellow citizens and had taken up
the ascetic life of a Cynic mendicant. He denounced the sexual looseness
of his time, and counseled hunger as a cure for love. His pupil
Hipparchia, having plenty to eat, fell in love with him, and threatened
to kill herself unless her parents gave her to him. They begged Crates
to dissuade her, which he tried to do by laying his beggar’s wallet at
her feet.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIX) THE SURRENDER OF PHILOSOPHY 65I</p>
<p>saying: “This is all my fortune; think now what you are doing.” Undis
- couraged, she left her rich home, donned the beggar’s garb, and went
to live with Crates in free love. Their nuptials, we are informed, were
consum- mated in public, but their lives were models of affection and
fidelity.“</p>
<p>Zeno was impressed by the stern simplicity of the Cynic life. The
fol- lowers of Antisthenes had now become the Franciscan monks of
antiquity, vowed to poverty and abstinence, sleeping in any natural
shelter that they came upon, and living upon the alms of people too
industrious to be saints. Zeno took from the Cynics the outlines of his
ethic, and did not conceal his debt. In his first book. The Republic, he
was so far under their influence that he espoused an anarchist communism
in which there should be no money, no property, no marriage, no
religion, and no laws.“ Recognizing that this utopia and the Cynic
regimen offered no practicable program of life, he left Crates and
studied for a time with Xenocrates at the Academy, and with Stilpo of
Megara. He must have read Heracleitus receptively, for he incorporated
into his own thought several Heracleitean ideas — the Divine Fire as the
soul of man and of the cosmos, the eternity of law, and the re- peated
creation and conflagration of the world. But it was his custom to say
that he owed most of all to Socrates, as the fountainhead and ideal of
the Stoic philosophy.</p>
<p>After many years of humble tutelage Zeno at last, in 301, set up his
own school by discoursing informally as he walked up and down under the
colonnades of the Stoa Poecile, or Pointed Porch. He welcomed poor and
rich alike, but discouraged the attendance of young men, feeling that
only mature manhood could understand philosophy. When a youth talked too
much Zeno informed him that “the reason why we have two ears and only
one mouth is that we may hear more and talk less.”“ Antigonus II, when
in Athens, attended Zeno’s cla sses, became his admiring friend, sought
his ad- vice, seduced him into momentary luxury, and invited him to come
and live as his guest in Pella. Zeno excused himself and sent his pupil
Persaeus instead. For forty years* he taught in the Stoa, and lived a
life so consistent with his teachings that “more temperate than Zeno”
became a proverb in Greece. Despite his intimacy with Antigonus the
Athenian Assembly gave him the “keys to the walls,” and voted him a
statue and a crown. The de - cree read;</p>

<p>“He died,” says Laertius, “in the following manner,” reputedly in his
nine - tieth year. “^ATien he was going out of his school he tripped and
broke a toe. Striking the ground with his hand, he repeated a line from
the Niobe: ‘I come; whycall me so?’ And immediately he strangled
himself.”®</p>
<p>His work at the Stoa was carried on by two Asiatic Greeks — by
Cleanthes of Assus and then by Chrysippus of Soli. Cleanthes was a
pugilist who came to Athens with four drachmas, worked as a common
laborer, refused public relief, studied for nineteen years under Zeno,
and lived a life of industry and ascetic poverty. Chrysippus was the
most learned and prolific of the school; he gave the Stoic doctrine its
historic form by expounding it in 750 books, which Dionysius of
Halicarnassus held up as models of learned dull- ness. After him
Stoicism spread throughout Hellas, and found its greatest exponents in
Asia: in Panaetius of Rhodes, Zeno of Tarsus, Boethus of Sidon, and
Diogenes of Seleucia. Out of the casual fragments that survive from a
once voluminous literature we must piece together a composite picture of
the most widespread and influential philosophy in the ancient world.</p>
<p>It was probably Chrysippus who divided the Stoic system into
logic,</p>
<p>natural science, and ethics. Zeno and his successors prided
themselves on their contributions to logical theory, but the streams of
ink that flowed from them on this subject have left no appreciable
residue of enlightenment or use.* The Stoics agreed with the Epicureans
that knowledge arises only out of the senses, and placed the final test
of truth in such perceptions as compel the assent of the mind by their
vividness or their persistence. Ex- perience, however, need not lead to
knowledge; for between sensation and reason lies emotion or passion,
which may distort experience into error even as it distorts desire into
vice. Reason is the supreme achievement of man, a seed from the Logos
Spermatikos, or Seminal Reason, that made and rules the world.</p>
<p>The world itself, like man, is at once completely material and
inherently divine. Everything that the senses report to us is material,
and only ma-</p>
<p>• Except in certain additions to terminology, like the word logic
itself. Zeno’s pupil Aristo likened logicians to people eating lobsters,
who take a great deal of trouble for a little morsel of meat concealed
in much shell.*”</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) THE SURRENDER OF PHILOSOPHY 653</p>
<p>terial things can cause or receive action. Qualities as well as
quantities, vir- tues as well as passions, soul as well as body, God as
well as the stars, are material forms or processes, differing in degrees
of fineness, but essentially one.“ On the other hand all matter is
dynamic, full of tensions and powers, perpetually engaged in diffusion
or concentration, and animated by an in- ternal and eternal energy,
heat, or fire. The universe lives through innumer- able cycles of
expansion and contraction, development and dissolution; periodically it
is consumed in a grand conflagration, and slowly it takes form again;
then it passes through all its previous history, even in minutest
detail;* for the chain of causes and effects is an unbreakable circle,
an end’ less repetition. All events and all acts of will are determined;
it is as im’ possible for anything to happen otherwise than it does as
it is for some- thing to come out of nothing; any break in the chain
would disrupt the world.</p>
<p>God, in this system, is the beginning, the middle, and the end. The
Stoics recognized the necessity of religion as a basis for morality;
they looked with a genial tolerance upon the popular faith, even upon
its demons and its divination, and found allegorical interpretations to
bridge the chasm be’ tween superstition and philosophy. They accepted
Chaldean astrology as essentially correct, and thought of earthly
affairs as in some mystic and continuous correspondence with the
movements of the stars“— one phase of that universal sympatheia by which
whatever happened to any part affected all the rest. As if preparing not
only an ethic but a theology for Christian’ ity, they conceived the
world, law, life, the soul, and destiny in terms of God, and defined
morality as a willing surrender to the divine will. God, like man, is
living matter; the world is his body, the order and law of the world are
his mind and will; the universe is a gigantic organism of which God is
the soul, the animating breath, the fertilizing reason, the activating
fire.“ Sometimes the Stoics conceive God in impersonal terms; more often
they picture him as a Providence designing and guiding the cosmos with
supreme intelligence, adjusting all its parts to rational purposes, and
making everything redound to the use of virtuous men. Cleanthes
identifies him with Zeus in a monotheistic hymn worthy of Ikhnaton or
Isaiah;</p>
<p>Thou, O Zeus, art praised above all gods: many are thy names and</p>
<p>thine is all power for ever.</p>
<p>The beginning of the world was from thee: and with law thou rul-</p>
<p>est over all things.</p>
<p>• We are relieved to learn that some of the Stoics were not quite
certain on this point.</p>

<p>XUnto thee may all flesh speak: for we are thy offspring.</p>

<p>around the earth:</p>
<p>With little and great lights mixed together: how great art thou,</p>
<p>King above all for ever!</p>
<p>Nor is anything done upon the earth apart from thee: nor in the</p>

<p>Thus hast thou fitted together all things in one: the good with
the</p>
<p>evil:</p>
<p>That thy word should be one in all things: abiding for ever.</p>
<p>Let folly be dispersed from our souls: that we may repay thee the</p>
<p>honor wherewith thou hast honored us:</p>
<p>Singing praise of thy works for ever: as becometh the sons of</p>
<p>men.“</p>
<p>Man is to the universe as microcosm to macrocosm; he too is an
organism with a material body and a material soul. For whatever moves or
influences the body, or is moved or influenced by the body, must be
corporeal. The soul is a fiery breath or pneuma diffused through the
body, just as the world soul is diffused through the world. At death the
soul survives the body, but only as an impersonal energy. At the final
conflagration the soul will be reabsorbed, like Atman into Brahman, into
that ocean of energy which is Since man is a part of God or Nature, the
problem of ethics can be easily solved: goodness is co-operation with
God, or Nature, or the Law of the World. It is not the pursuit or
enjoyment of pleasure, for such pursuit sub- ordinates reason to
passion, often injures the body or the mind, and seldom satisfies us in
the end. Happiness can be found only through a rational ad- justment of
our aims and conduct to the purposes and laws of the universe. There is
no contradiction between the good of the individual and the good of the
cosmos, for the law of well-being in the individual is identical with
the law of Nature. If evil comes to the good man it is only temporary,
and is not really evil; if we could understand the whole we should see
the good</p>
<p>chap.xxk) the surrender of philosophy 655</p>
<p>behind whatever evil appears in the parts.* The wise man will study
science only sufficiently to find the law of Nature, and will then adapt
his life to that Law. 2.en kata physin, to live according to Nature —
this is the pur- pose and sole excuse of science and philosophy. Almost
in Newman’s words Cleanthes surrenders his wi ll to God’s:</p>
<p>Lead me, O God, and thou my Destiny,</p>
<p>To that one place which you will have me fill.</p>
<p>I follow gladly. Should I strive with thee,</p>
<p>A recreant, I needs must follow still.*</p>
<p>The Stoic, therefore, will shun luxury and complexity, economic or
po- litical strife; he will content himself with httle, and will accept
without complaint the difficulties and disappointments of life. He will
be indiffer- ent to everything but virtue and vice — to sickness and
pain, good or ill re- pute, freedom or slavery, life or death. He will
suppress all feelings that may obstruct the course or question the
wisdom of Nature: if his son dies he will not grieve, but will accept
Fate’s decree as in some hidden way the best. He will seek so complete
an apatheia, or absence of feeling, that his peace of mind will be
secure against all the attacks and vicissitudes of for- tune, pity, or
love.f He will be a hard teacher and a stem administrator. Determinism
does not imply indulgence; we must hold ourselves, and others, morally
responsible for every action. When Zeno beat his slave for steal- ing,
and the slave, having a little learning, said, “But it was fated that I
should steal,” Zeno answered, “And that I should beat you.”“ The Stoic
looks upon virtue as its own reward, and as an absolute duty or
categorical impera- tive, derived from his participation in divinity;
and he will console himself, in misfortune, by remembering that in
following the divine law he becomes an incarnate god.® When he is tired
of life, and can leave it without injur- ing others, he will have no
scruples against suicide. Cleanthes, having reached his seventieth year,
entered upon a long fast; and then, saying that he would not go back
after coming halfway, continued it until he died.® The Stoic, however,
is not unsocial, neither so proud of poverty as the Cynic, nor so
enamored of solitude as the Epicurean. He accepts marriage and the
family as necessary, though he has no praise for romantic love; he</p>
<p>• Wars, said Chrysippus, are a useful corrective of overpopulation^
and bedbugs do us the service of preventing us from oversleeping.®</p>
<p>t Chrysippus proposed to limit the care of dead relatives to the
simplest and quietest burial; it would be still better, he thought, to
use their flesh as food.®</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Xdreams of a utopia in which all women will be in common.“ He accepts
the state, even monarchy; he has no fond memories of the city-state, and
con- siders the average man a dangerous simpleton; he prefers the
Antigonids to King Moh. In truth he cares little for any government; he
wishes that all men might be philosophers, so that laws would be
unnecessary; he thinks of perfection not, as Plato and Aristotle did, in
terms of the good society, but in terms of the good man. He may take
part in political affairs, and will support every move, however modest,
toward human freedom and dignity; but he will not fetter his happiness
to place or power. He may give his life for his country, but he will
reject any patriotism that hinders his loyalty to all mankind; he is a
citizen of the world. Zeno, in whose veins, as we have seen, there
probably flowed both Greek and Semitic blood, longed like Alexander for
a breaking down of racial and national barriers, and his in-
ternationalism reflects Alexander’s passing unification of the eastern
Medi - terranean world. Ultimately, Zeno and Chrysippus hoped, all those
war- ring states and classes would be replaced by one vast society in
which there would be no nations, no classes, no rich or poor, no masters
or slaves; in which philosophers would rule without oppression, and all
men would be brothers as the children of one God.“</p>
<p>Stoicism was a noble philosophy, and proved more practicable than a
modem cynic would expect. It brought together all the elements of Greek
thought in a final effort of the pagan mind to create a system of morals
ac- ceptable to the classes that had abandoned the ancient creed; and
though it naturally won only a small minority to its standard, those few
were every- where the best. Like its Christian counterparts, Calvinism
and Puritanism, it produced the strongest characters of its time.
Theoretically it was a mon- strous doctrine of an isolated and pitiless
perfection. Actually it created men of courage, saintliness, and good
will like Cato the Younger, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius; it
influenced Roman jurisprudence in building a law of nations for
non-Romans; and it helped to hold ancient society together until a new
faith came. The Stoics lent countenance to superstition, and had an
injurious effect upon science; but they saw clearly the basic prob- lem
of their age — the collapse of the theological basis of morals — and
they made an honest attempt to bridge the gap between religion and
philosophy. Epicurus won the Greeks, Zeno won the aristocracy of Rome;
and to the end of pagan history the Stoics raled the Epicureans, as they
always will. When a new religion took form out of the intellectual and
moral chaos of die dying Hellenistic world, the way had been prepared
for it by a philoso-</p>

<p>phy that acknowledged the necessity of faith, preached an ascetic
doctrine of simplicity and self-restraint, and saw all things in
God.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE RETURN TO RELIGION</li>
</ol>
<p>The conflict between religion and philosophy had now seen three
stages: the attack on religion, as in the pre-Socratics; the endeavor to
replace re- ligion with a natural ethic, as in Aristotle and Epicurus;
and the return to religion in the Skeptics and the Stoics — a movement
that culminated in Neo-Platonism and Christianity. A like sequence has
occurred more than once in history, and may be taking place today.
Thales corresponds to Galileo, Democritus to Hobbes, the Sophists to the
Encyclopedists, Protag- oras to Voltaire; Aristotle to Spencer, Epicurus
to Anatole France; Pyrrho to Pascal, Arcesilaus to Hume, Cameades to
Kant, Zeno to Schopenhauer, Plotinus to Bergson. The chronology resists
the analogy, but the basic line of development is the same.</p>
<p>The age of the great systems gave way to doubt in the ability of
reason either to understand the world or to control the impulses of men
into order and civilization. The skeptics were such not in the Humian
but in the Kantian sense: they doubted philosophy as well as dogma,
sapped the foundations of materialism, and advised a quiet acceptance of
the ancient cult; in Pyrrho, as in Pascal, skepticism led not from but
to religion, and Pyrrho himself ended as the venerated high priest of
his city. The Epi- curean abandonment of politics for ethics, the flight
from the state to the soul, could only represent a moment in the return
of the pendulum; and the concentration on individual salvation paved the
way for a religion that would appeal to the individual rather than to
the state. There were many who could not find in life the consolations
that had satisfied Epicurus; poverty, misfortune, disease, bereavement,
revolution, or war overtook them, and all the counsels of the sage left
them empty-souled. Hegesias of Gyrene, though he started Hke Epicurus
from the standpoint of the Cyre- naics, concluded that life has in it
more pain than pleasure, more grief than joy, and that the only logical
outcome of a naturalistic philosophy is suicide.* Philosophy, like a
prodigal daughter, after bright adventures and dark disillusionments,
gave up the pursuit of truth and the quest of happi- ness, returned
repentant to her mother, religion, and sought again in faith the
foundations of hope and the sanctions of charity.</p>
<p>• He argued the point so eloquently that a wave of suicides rose in
Alexandria, and Ptole - my II had to banish him from Egypt.®®</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>(chap, xxk</p>
<p>Stoicism, while seeking to construct a natural ethic for the
intellectual classes, sought to preserve the old supernatural aids for
the morality of the common man, and, as time went on, gave a more and
more religious color to its own metaphysical and ethical thought. Zeno
denied any real existence to the popular gods,” but a generation later
Cleanthes proposed to prosecute Aristarchus for heresy. Zeno offered no
personal immortality, but Seneca spoke of heavenly bliss in terms almost
identical with those of the Eleusinian and Christian faiths.” After Zeno
Stoicism became a theology rather than a philosophy, and nearly every
proposition in it took a theological form. The greater part of the
system was composed of arguments about the ex- istence and nature of
God, the emanation of the world from God, the real- ity of Providence,
the correspondence of virtue with the divine will, the brotherhood of
man under the fatherhood of God, and the final return of the world to
God, In this philosophy we find the sense of sin that was to play so
stem a role in primitive and in Protestant Christianity, the lofty in-
clusiveness that as in the new religions welcomed all races and ranks,
and a celibate asceticism that derived from the Cynics and culminated in
a long line of Christian monks. From Zeno of Tarsus to Paul of Tarsus
was but a step, which would be taken on the road to Damascus.</p>
<p>Many components of the Stoic creed were Asiatic in origin, some were
specifically Semitic. In essentials Stoicism was one elemental phase of
the (Oriental triumph over Hellenic dvilization. Greece had ceased to be
Greece before it was conquered by Rome.</p>
