<h4 id="chapter-xxv">CHAPTER XXV</h4>
<p>Rome and Judea</p>
<p>I32 B.C.-A.D.I35</p>
<p>I. PARTHIA</p>
<p>B ETWEEN Pontus and the Caucasus rose the troubled mountains of
Armenia, on whose crest, story told, Noah’s ark had found a mooring.
Through the fertile valleys ran the roads that led from Parthia and
Mesopotamia to the Black Sea; hence empires competed for Armenia. The
people were Indo- European, akin to the Hittites and the Phrygians, but
they had never surrendered their sweeping Anatolian nose. They were a
vigorous race, patient in agricul- ture, skilled in handicraft,
unequaled in commercial acumen; they made the best of a difficult
terrain and raised enough wealth to keep their kings in luxury if not in
power. Darius I, in the Behistun inscription (521 b.c.), named Armenia
among the satrapies of Persia; later it gave a nominal allegiance to the
Seleucids and then alternately to Parthia and Rome; but its remoteness
allowed it a prac- tical independence. Its most famous king, Tigranes
the Great (94-56 b.c.), conquered Cappadocia, added a second capital,
Tigranocerta, to Artaxata, and joined Mithridates’ revolt against Rome.
When Pompey accepted his apologies he gave the victorious general 6000
talents (1,600,000), 10,000 drachmas (000) to each centurion, and fifty
to each soldier, in the Roman army. 1 Under Caesar, Augustus, and Nero
Armenia acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and under Trajan it was for
a time a Roman province; nevertheless, its culture was Iranian, and its
usual orientation was toward Parthia.</p>
<p>The Parthians had for centuries occupied the region south of the
Caspian Sea as subjects of the Achaemenid, then of the Seleucid, kings.
They were of Scythian-Turanian stock — i.e., they belonged racially with
the peoples of south- ern Russia and Turkestan. About 248 b.c. a
Scythian chief, Arsaces, revolted against the Seleucid authority, made
Parthia a sovereign state, and established the Arsacid dynasty. The
Seleucid kings, weakened by Rome’s defeat of Anti - ochus III (189
b.c.), were unable to defend their territory against the reckless,
half-barbarous Parthians, and by the end of the second century b.c. all
Meso- potamia and Persia were absorbed into a new Parthian Empire. Three
capitals, according to the season, entertained the new royalty:
Hecatompylus in Parthia, Ecbatana in Media, and Ctesiphon on the lower
Tigris. Across from Ctesiphon lay the former Seleucid capital Seleucia,
which remained for centuries a Greek city in a Parthian realm. The
Arsacid rulers kept the administrative structure</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA S 2 9</p>
<p>built up by the Seleucids, but overlaid it with a feudalism derived
from the Achaemenid kings. The mass of the population was composed of
agricultural serfs and slaves; industry was backward, but the Parthian
ironworkers made a fine steel, and “the brewing trade was highly
profitable.” 2 The wealth of the state came partly from the trade that
passed along the great rivers, partly from the caravans that crossed
Parthia on the way between farther Asia and the West. From 53 b.c., when
the Parthians defeated Crassus at Carrhae, to a.d. 217, when Macrinus
bought peace from Artabanus, Rome fought war after war for the control
of these routes and the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The Parthians were too rich or too poor to indulge in literature. The
aristo- crats, as in all ages, preferred the art of life to the life of
art, and the serfs were too illiterate, the artisans too busy, the
merchants too commercial, to produce great art or great books. The
people spoke Pahlavi and wrote in Aramaic on parchment, which now
replaced cuneiform; but not a line of Parthian literature has been
preserved. We know that Greek plays were enjoyed in Ctesiphon as well as
in Seleucia, for the head of Crassus played a part there in the Bacchae
of Euripides. The paintings and sculptures discovered at Palmyra,
Dura-Europus, and Ashur were probably the work of Iranian artists; their
crude amalgam of Greek and Oriental styles affected later art from China
to Byzantium. A vivid relief of a mounted archer has come down to us to
suggest that we might have a higher opinion of Parthian art if more of
it remained. 211 At Hatra, near Mosul, an Arabian feudatory of the
Parthian king built (88 b.c.?) a limestone palace of seven arched and
vaulted halls, in a powerful but barbarous style. Good Parthian work has
survived in engraved silverware and jewelry.</p>
<p>The Parthians excelled in man’s favorite art— personal adornment.
Both sexes curled their hair; the men nursed frizzed beards and flowing
mustaches, and clothed themselves in tunic and baggy trousers, usually
covered with a many- colored robe; the women swathed themselves in
delicate embroideries and decked their hair with flowers. Free Parthians
amused themselves with hunting, ate and drank abundantly, and never went
on foot when they could ride. They were brave warriors and honorable
foes, treated prisoners decently, admitted foreigners to high office,
and gave asylum to refugees; sometimes, however, they mutilated dead
enemies, tortured witnesses, and corrected trifling offenses with the
scourge. They practiced polygamy according to their means, veiled and
secluded their women, severely punished the infidelity of their wives,
but permitted divorce to either sex almost at will. 3 When the Parthian
general Surena led an army against Crassus he took with him 200
concubines and a thousand camels for his baggage. 4 All in all the
Parthians impress us as less civilized than the Achaemenid Persians and
more honorable gentlemen than the Romans. They were tolerant of
religious diversities, allowing the Greeks, Jews, and Christians among
them to practice their rituals unhindered. They themselves, veering from
Zoroastrian orthodoxy, worshiped the sun and the moon, and preferred
Mithras to Ahura-Mazda, much as the Christians preferred Christ to
Yahveh, The Magi, neglected by the later Arsacid kings, abetted the
overthrow of the dynasty.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>530</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>On the death of VologasesIV (a.d. 209) his sons Vologases Vand
AxtabanusIV fought for the throne. Artabanus won, and then defeated the
Romans at Nisibis. Three centuries of war between the empires ended in a
modified victory for Parthia; on the Mesopotamian plains the Roman
legions were at a disadvantage against the Parthian cavalry. Artabanus
in turn fell in civil war. His conqueror, Ardashir or Artaxerxes, feudal
lord of Persia, made himself King of Kings (a.d. 227) and established
the Sassanid dynasty. The Zoroastrian religion was restored, and Persia
entered upon a greater age.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE HASMONEANS</li>
</ol>
<p>In 143 b.c. Simon Maccabee, taking advantage of the struggles among
the Parthians, Seleucids, Egyptians, and Romans, wrested the
independence of Judea from the Seleucid king. A popular assembly named
him general and high priest of the Second Jewish Commonwealth ( 142
b.c-a.d. 70), and made the latter office hereditary in his Hasmonean
family. Judea became again a theocracy, under the Hasmonean dynasty of
priest-kings. It has been a characteristic of Semitic societies that
they closely associated the spiritual and temporal powers, in the family
and in the state; they would have no sovereign but God.</p>
<p>Recognizing the weakness of the little kingdom, the Hasmoneans spent
two generations widening its borders by diplomacy and force. By 78 b.c.
they had conquered and absorbed Samaria, Edom, Moab, Galilee, Idumea,
Transjordania, Gadara, Pella, Gerasa, Raphia, and Gaza, and had made
Pales- tine as extensive as under Solomon. The descendants of those
brave Mac- cabees who had fought for religious freedom enforced Judaism
and circum- cision upon their new subjects at the point of the sword. 0
At the same time the Hasmoneans lost their religious zeal and, over the
bitter protests of the Pharisees, yielded more and more to the
Hellenizing elements in the popula- tion. Queen Salome Alexandra (78-69
b.c.) reversed this trend and made peace with the Pharisees, but even
before her death her sons Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II began a war of
succession. Both parties submitted theii claims to Pompey, who now (63
b.c.) stood with his victorious legions at Damascus. When Pompey decided
for Hyrcanus, Aristobulus fortified him- self with his army in
Jerusalem. Pompey laid siege to the capital and gained its lower
sections; but the followers of Aristobulus took refuge in the walled
precincts of the Temple and held out for three months. Their piety, we
are told, helped Pompey to overcome them; for perceiving that they would
not fight on the Sabbath, he had his men prepare unhindered on each
Sabbath the mounds and battering rams for the next day’s assault.
Meanwhile</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) ROME AND JUDEA 531</p>
<p>the priests offered the usual prayers and sacrifices in the Temple.
When the ramparts fell 12,000 Jews were slaughtered; few resisted, none
surrendered, many leaped to death from the walls. 0 Pompey ordered his
men to leave the treasures of the Temple untouched, but he exacted an
indemnity of</p>
<p>10.000 talents (,600,000) from the nation. The cities that the
Hasmoneans had conquered were transferred from the Judean to the Roman
power; Hyrcanus II was made high priest and nominal ruler of Judea, but
as the ward of Antipater the Idumean, who had helped Rome. The
independent monarchy was ended, and Judea became part of the Roman
province of Syria.</p>
<p>In 54 b.c. Crassus, on his way to play the part of Pentheus at
Ctesiphon, robbed the Temple of the treasures that Pompey had spared,
amounting to some 10,000 talents. When news came that Crassus had been
defeated and killed, the Jews took the opportunity to reclaim their
freedom. Longinus, successor of Crassus as governor of Syria, suppressed
the revolt and sold</p>
<p>30.000 Jews into slavery (43 b.c.). 7 In that same year Antipater
died; the Parthians swept across the desert into Judea and set up, as
their puppet king, Antigonus, the last of the Hasmoneans. Antony and
Octavian countered by naming Herod — son of Antipater — king of Judea
and financing his Jewish army with Roman funds. Herod drove out the
Parthians, protected Jeru- salem from pillage, sent Antigonus to Antony
for execution, slew all Jewish leaders who had supported the puppet, and
so auspiciously entered upon one of the most colorful reigns in history
(37-4 b.c.).</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>HEROD THE GREAT</li>
</ol>
<p>His character was typical of an age that had produced so many men of
intellect without morals, ability without scruple, and courage without
honor. He was in his lesser way the Augustus of Judea: like Augustus he
overlaid the chaos of freedom with dictatorial order, beautified his
capital with Greek architecture and sculpture, enlarged his realm, made
it prosper, achieved more by subtlety than by arms, married widely, was
broken by the treachery of his offspring, and knew every good fortune
but happiness. Josephus describes him as a man of great physical bravery
and skill, a perfect marks- man with arrow and javelin, a mighty hunter
who in one day caught forty wild beasts, and “such a warrior as could
not be withstood.” 8 He must have added some charm of personality to
these qualities, for he was always able to outtalk or outbribe the
enemies who sought to discredit him with Antony, Cleopatra, or Octavian.
From every crisis with the Triumvirs he emerged</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>with larger powers and territory than before, until Augustus judged
him “too great a soul for so small a dominion,” restored the cities of
Hasmonean Palestine to his kingdom, and wished Herod might rule Syria
and Egypt too . 9 “The Idumean” was a generous as well as a ruthless
man, and the bene - fits he conferred upon his subjects were equaled
only by the injuries he did them.</p>
<p>He was molded in part by the hatred of those whom he had defeated or
whose relatives he had slain, and by the scornful hostility of a people
that resented his harsh autocracy and his alien descent. He had become
king by the help and money of Rome, and remained to the end of his life
a friend and vassal of the power from which the people night and day
plotted to re- gain their liberty. The modest economy of the country
bent and at last broke under the taxes imposed upon it by a luxurious
court and a building program out of proportion to the national wealth.
Herod sought in various ways to appease his subjects, but failed. He
forgave taxes in poor years, per- suaded Rome to reduce the tribute it
exacted, secured privileges for Jews abroad, relieved famine and other
calamities promptly, maintained internal order and external security,
and developed the natural resources of the land. Brigandage was ended,
trade was stimulated, the markets and ports were noisy with life. At the
same time the King alienated public sentiment by the looseness of his
morals, the cruelty of his punishments, and the “accidental”</p>
<p>Ruling many cities that were more Greek than Jewish in population and
culture, and impressed with the refinement and variety of Hellenic
civiliza- tion, Herod, himself not by origin or conviction a Jew,
naturally sought a cultural unity for his realm, and an imposing fa£ade
for his rule, by encour- aging Greek ways, dress, ideas, literature, and
art. He surrounded himself with Greek scholars, entrusted to them high
affairs of state, and made Nicolas of Damascus, a Greek, his official
counselor and historian. He raised at great expense a theater and an
amphitheater in Jerusalem, adorned them with monuments to Augustus and
other pagans, and introduced Greek athletic and musical contests and
Roman gladiatorial combats . 10 He beautified Jerusalem with other
buildings in what seemed to the people a foreign archi- tectural style,
and set up in public places Greek statuary whose nudity startled the
Jews as much as the nakedness of the wrestlers in the games. He built
himself a palace, doubtless on Greek models, filled it with gold and
marble and costly furniture, and surrounded it with extensive gardens
after</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA 533</p>
<p>the manner of his Roman friends. He shocked the people by telling
them that the Temple whicli Zcrubbabel had set up five centuries before
was too small, and proposing to tear it down and erect a larger one on
its site. Despite their protests and their fears he realized his plan
and reared the lordly Temple that Titus would destroy.</p>
<p>On Mt. Moriah an area was cleared 750 feet square. Along its
boundaries cloisters were built roofed with cedar “curiously graven,”
and supported by multiple rows of Corinthian columns, each a marble
monolith so large that three men could barely join hands around it. In
this main court were the booths of the money-changers, who for the
convenience of pilgrims changed foreign coins into those acceptable to
the Sanctuary; here, too, were the stalls where one might buy animals to
offer in sacrifice, and the rooms or porticoes where teachers and pupils
met to study Hebrew and the Law, and the noisy beggars inevitable in
Oriental scenes. From this “Outer - Jews were forbidden to enter; here
was the “Court of the Women,” where “such men as were pure came in with
their wives.” 11 From this second en - closure the worshiper passed up
another flight of steps, and through gates plated with silver and gold,
into the “Court of the Priests,” where stood, in the open air, the altar
upon which burnt sacrifice was offered to Yahveh. Still other steps led
through bronze doors seventy-five feet high and twenty-four wide,
overhung with a famous golden vine, into the temple proper, open only to
priests. It was built entirely of white marble, in set-back style, and
its fa- 9ade was plated with gold. The interior was divided crosswise by
a great em- broidered veil, blue and purple and scarlet. Before the veil
were the golden seven-branched candlestick, the altar of incense, and
the table bearing the unleavened “shewbread” that the priests laid
before Yahveh. Behind the veil was the Holy of Holies, which in the
earlier temple had contained a golden censer and the Ark of the
Covenant, but in this temple, says Josephus, contained “nothing
whatever.” Here human foot trod only once a year, on the Day of
Atonement, when the high priest entered alone. The main struc- tures of
this historic edifice were finished in eight years; the work of adorn-
ment, however, continued for eighty years, and was just completed when
Titus’ legions came. 12</p>
<p>The people were proud of the great shrine, which was ranked among the
marvels of the Augustan world; for its splendor they almost forgave the
Corinthian columns of the porticoes and the golden eagle that — defying
the Jewish prohibition of graven images — symbolized at the very
entrance to the Temple the power of Judea’s enemy and master, Rome.
Meanwhile Jews who traveled brought back news of the completely Greek
buildings with which Herod was remaking the other cities of Palestine,
and told how he was</p>
<p>534 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.XXV</p>
<p>spending national funds, and (rumor said) the gold that had been
hidden in David’s tomb, 13 in constructing a great harbor at Caesarea,
and lavishing gifts upon such foreign cities as Damascus, Byblus,
Berytus, Tyre, Sidon, Antioch, Rhodes, Pergamum, Sparta, and Athens.
Herod, it became clear, wished to be the idol of the Hellenic world, not
merely the King of the Jews. But the Jews lived by their religion, by
their faith that Yahveh would someday rescue them from bondage and
oppression; the triumph of the Hellenic over the Hebraic spirit in the
person of their ruler foreboded to them a disaster as great as the
persecutions of Antiochus. Plots were formed against Herod’s life; he
discovered them, arrested the conspirators, tortured</p>
<p>He foiled all his enemies except his wives and his children. Of wives
he had ten, once nine at a time; of children, fourteen. His second wife,
Mariamne, was the grandaughter of Hyrcanus II and the sister of
Aristobulus, both of whom Herod had sl ain. She was, says Josephus, “a
chaste woman, but some - what rough by nature, and treated her husband
imperiously because she saw he was so fond of her as to be her slave. .
. . She would also expose his mother and sister openly, on account of
the meanness of their birth, and would speak unkindly of them, insomuch
that there was an unpardoning hatred among the women” of the royal
household. Herod’s sister persuaded him that Mariamne was plotting to
poison him. He accused his wife before the members of his court; they
condemned her, and she was executed. Doubtful of her guilt, Herod was
for a time mad with remorse; he called out her name repeatedly, sent his
servants to summon her, gave up public affairs, went into the desert,
“afflicted himself bitterly,” and was brought to his palace in a state
of fever and insanity. Mariamne’s mother joined with others in an
attempt to depose him; he suddenly recovered his powers of mind and
throne, and put the plotters to death. Soon thereafter Antipater, his
son by his first wife, laid proofs before him of an attempted conspiracy
by Alexander and Aristobulus, his sons by Mariamne; he submitted the
matter to a council of 150 men, who sentenced the youths to die (6
b.c.). Two years later Nicolas of Damascus convicted Antipater himself
of schem- ing to replace his father. Herod had the youth brought before
him and “be - gan to weep, lamenting the misfortunes he had suffered
from his children.” 16 In a moment of mercy he ordered Antipater
jailed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the old king was breaking down with disease and grief. He
suffered from dropsy, ulcer, fever, convulsions, and loathsome breath.
After frustrating so many attempts against his life he tried to kill
himself, but was prevented. Hearing that Antipater had sought to bribe
the guard to free</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA 535</p>
<p>him, Herod had him slain. Five days afterward he too died (4 B.c.),
in the sixty-ninth year of his age, hated by all his people. It was said
of him by his enemies that “he stole to the throne like a fox, ruled
like a tiger, and died like a dog.” 17</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE LAW AND ITS PROPHETS</li>
</ol>
<p>Herod’s will divided his kingdom among three remaining sons. To
Philip went the eastern region known as Batanea, containing the cities
of Beth- saida, Capitolias, Gerasa, Philadelphia, and Bostra. To Herod
Antipas went Peraea (the land beyond the Jordan) and, in the north,
Galilee, where lay Esdraela, Tiberias, and Nazareth. To Archelaus fell
Samarids, Idumea, and Judea. In this last were many famous cities or
towns: Bethlehem, Hebron, Beersheba, Gaza, Gadara, Emmaus, Jamnia,
Joppa, Caesarea, Jericho, and Jerusalem. Some Palestinian cities were
predominantly Greek, some Syrian; the Gadarene swine attest the non-Jews
of Gadara. The gentiles were in the majority in all the coast towns
except Joppa and Jamnia, and in the “Decap - olis” or ten cities of the
Jordan; in the interior the villages were almost entirely Jewish. In
this racial division, not unpleasing to Rome, lay the tragedy of
Palestine.</p>
<p>We must go back to the Puritans of England to understand the
repulsion aroused in pious Jews by the polytheism and immorality of
pagan society. Religion was to the Jews the source of their law, their
state, and their hope: to let it melt away in the swelling river of
Hellenism would, they thought, be national suicide. Hence that mutual
hatred of Jew and gehtdle which kept the little nation in a kind of
undulating fever of racial strife, political turbulence, and periodic
war. Moreover, the Jews of Judea scorned the people of Galilee as
ignorant backsliders, and the Galileans scorned the Judeans as slaves
caught in the cobwebs of the Law. Again, a perpetual feud burned between
Judeans and Samaritans; for the latter claimed that their hill of
Gerizim, and not Zion, had been chosen by Yahveh as his home, and they
rejected all the Scriptures except the Pentateuch. 18 All these factions
agreed in hating the Roman power, which made them pay a heavy price for
the unwelcome privilege of peace.</p>
<p>There were now in Palestine some 2,500,000 souls, of whom perhaps
100,000 lived in Jerusalem. 19 Most of them spoke Aramaic; priests and
scholars understood Hebrew; officials and foreigners and most authors
used Greek. The majority of the people were peasants, tilling and
irrigating the soil, tending the orchard, the vine, and the flock. In
the time of Christ Palestine grew enough wheat to export a modest
surplus: 20 its dates, figs, grapes and olives, wine and oil were prized
and bought throughout the Medi-</p>

<p>terranean. The old command was still obeyed to let the land lie
fallow in each sabbatical year. 21 Handicrafts were largely hereditary
and were usually organized in guilds. Jewish opinion honored the worker,
and most scholars plied their hands as well as their tongues. Slaves
were fewer than in any other Mediterranean country. Petty trade
flourished, but there were as yet few Jewish merchants of large means
and range. “We are not a commercial people,” said Josephus; “we live in
a country 〔eastern Judea〕 without a sea - board, and have no
inclination to 〔foreign〕 trade.” 22 Financial operations were of minor
scope until Hillel, perhaps at Herod’s suggestion, abrogated the law of
Deuteronomy (xv, 1-11) requiring the cancellation of debts every seventh
year. The Temple itself was the national bank.</p>
<p>Within the Temple was the hall Gazith, meeting place of the Sanhedrin
or Great Council of the Elders of Israel. Probably the institution arose
in the period of Seleucid rule ( ca . 200 B.c.), to replace the earlier
council men- tioned in Numbers (xi, 16) as advising Moses. Originally
selected by the high priest from the sacerdotal aristocracy, it had come
in Roman times to co-opt into its membership a rising number of
Pharisees and a few profes- sional Scribes. 23 These seventy-one men,
under the presidency of the high priest, claimed supreme power over all
Jews everywhere, and orthodox Jews everywhere acknowledged it; but the
Hasmoneans, Herod, and Rome recognized their authority only in
violations of Jewish law by a Judean Jew. They could pass sentence of
death upon Jews in Judea for religious offenses, but could not execute
it without confirmation by the civil power. 24</p>
<p>In this assembly, as in most, two factions fought for predominance —
a con- servative group led by the higher priests and the Sadducees, and
a liberal group led by Pharisees and Scribes. Most of the upper clergy
and upper classes belonged to the Sadducees (Z adokhu), so named after
their founder Zadok; they were nationalistic in politics and orthodox in
religion; they stood for the enforcement of the Torah or written Law,
but rejected the additional ordinances of the oral tradition and the
liberalizing interpretations of the Pharisees. They doubted immortality
and were content to possess the good things of the earth.</p>
<p>The Pharisees ( Perushiin , separatists) were so named by the
Sadducees as meaning that they separated themselves (like good Brahmans)
from those who contracted religious impurity by neglecting the
requirements of ritual cleanliness. 25 They were a continuation of the
Chasidim, or Devotees, of the Maccabean age, who had upheld the
strictest application of the Law. Josephus, himself a Pharisee, defined
them as “ a body of Jews who profess to be more religious than the rest,
and to explain the laws more precisely.” 20 For this purpose they added
to the written Law of the Pentateuch the oral tradition of
interpretations and decisions made by recognized teachers of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA 537</p>
<p>Law. These interpretations were necessary, in the judgment of the
Phari- sees, to clarify the obscurities of the Mosaic Code, to specify
its application in particular cases, and to modify its letter,
occasionally, in adaptation to the changed needs and conditions of life.
They were at once rigorous and lenient, softening the Law here and there
as in Hillel’s decree on interest, but demanding the full observation of
the oral tradition as well as of the Torah. Only through this full
obedience, they felt, could the Jews escape assimilation and extinction.
Reconciled to Roman domination, the Pharisees sought consolation in the
hope of a physical and spiritual immortality. They lived simply,
condemned luxury, fasted frequently, washed sedulously, and were now and
then irritatingly conscious of their virtue; but they repre- sented the
moral strength of Judaism, won the middle classes to their support, and
gave their followers a faith and rule that saved them from
disintegration when catastrophe came. After the Temple was destroyed
(a.d. 70), the priesthood lost influence, the Sadducees disappeared, the
synagogue replaced the temple, and the Pharisees, through the rabbis,
became the teachers and shepherds of a scattered but undefeated
people.</p>
<p>The most extreme of the Jewish sects was that of the Essenes. They
de- rived their piety from the Chasidim, their name probably from the
Chaldaic aschai (bather), their doctrine and practice from the stream of
ascetic theory and regimen circulating through the world of the last
century before Christ; possibly they were influenced by Brahmanic,
Buddhist, Parsee, Pythagorean, and Cynic ideas that came to the
crossroads of trade at Jerusalem. Number- ing some 4000 in Palestine,
they organized themselves into a distinct order, observed both the
written and the oral Law with passionate exactitude, and lived together
as almost monastic celibates tilling the soil in the oasis of Engadi
amid the desert west of the Dead Sea. They dwelt in homes owned by their
community, had their meals in common and in silence, chose their leaders
by a general vote, mingled their goods and earnings in a common
treasury, and obeyed the Chasidic motto, “Mine and thine belong to
thee.” 27 Many of them, says Josephus, “lived more than a hundred years
because of their simple diet and regular life.” 28 Each clothed himself
in white linen, carried a little hoe to cover his droppings, washed
himself like a Brahmin afterward, and considered it a sacrilege to
evacuate on the Sabbath. 29 A few of them married and lived in towns,
but practiced the Tolstoian rule of co- habiting with their wives only
to beget children. The members of the sect avoided all sensual pleasure
and sought through meditation and prayer a mystic union with God. They
hoped that by piety, abstinence, and con- templation they might acquire
magic powers and foresee the future. Like most people of their time they
believed in angels and demons, thought of diseases as possession by evil
spirits, and tried to exorcise these by magical</p>
<p>53 8 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.XXV</p>
<p>formulas; from their “secret doctrine” came some parts of the Cabala.
80 They looked for the coming of a Messiah who would establish a
communistic egalitarian Kingdom of Heaven ( Malchutb Shamayim) on earth;
into that Kingdom only those would enter who had led a spotless life. 81
They were ardent pacifists and refused to make implements of war; but
when the legions of Titus attacked Jerusalem and the Temple the Essenes
joined other Jews in defending their city and its shrine and fought till
nearly all of their order were dead. As Josephus describes their customs
and their sufferings we enter into the atmosphere of Christianity:</p>
<p>Although they were tortured and racked, burnt and tom to pieces,</p>
<p>and went through every torment to force them either to blaspheme
their legislator, or to eat what was forbidden them, yet could they not
be made to do either of them; no, nor once to flatter their tormentors,
or to shed a tear. But they smiled in their very pains, and laughed</p>
<p>those to scorn who tortured them, and gave up their souls in
great</p>
<p>cheerfulness, as expecting to receive them again. S2</p>
<p>These — Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes — were the chief religious
sects of Judea in the generation before Christ. The Scribes ( Hakamin ,
learned) whom Jesus so often bracketed with the Pharisees were not a
sect but a profession; they were scholars learned in the Law, who
lectured on it in synagogues, taught it in schools, debated it in public
and private, and ap- plied it in judgment on specific cases. A few of
them were priests, some were Sadducees, most were Pharisees; they were
in the two centuries before Hillel what the rabbis were after him. They
were the iurisprudentes of Judea, whose legal opinions, selected by time
and transmitted by word of mouth from teacher to pupil, became part of
that oral tradition which the Pharisees honored along with the written
Law. Under their influence the Code of Moses proliferated into thousands
of detailed precepts designed to meet every circumstance.</p>
<p>The earliest definite figure among these lay teachers of the Law is
that of Hillel, and even he is nearly lost in the web of legend that a
fond posterity wove about his name. We are told that he was born in
Babylon (75 b.c.?) of a distinguished but impoverished family. He came
as a grown man to Jerusalem, where he supported his wife and children by
manual labor. Half his daily wage he paid for admission to the school
where two famous masters, Shemaya and Abtolim, expounded the Law.
Lacking the fee one day, and denied entry, he climbed upon a window sill
“that he might hear the words of the living God.” Frozen with the cold,
story says, he fell into the snow and was found there half dead the next
morning. 33 He became in his turn a revered rabbi or teacher, renowned
for his modesty, patience, and gentleness.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) ROME AND JUDEA 539</p>
<p>One account tells how a man wagered he could anger Hillel, and lost.
34 He laid down three principles for the guidance of life: love of man,
of peace, and of the Law and the knowledge of it. When a would-be
proselyte asked him to explain the Law in as little time as a man could
stand on one foot, Hillel answered: “What is hateful to thyself do not
do to another”; 35 * it was a cautiously negative form of that Golden
Rule which had long before been phrased positively in Leviticus. Again
Hillel taught: “Judge not thy neighbor until thou art in his place.” 37
He sought to quiet the quarreling sects by laying down seven rules for
interpreting the Law. His own inter- pretations were liberal; most
notably, he facilitated the lending of money and the procurement of
divorce. He was a pacifier, not a reformer; “sepa - rate not thys elf
from the congregation,” he advised the young rebels of his day. He
accepted Herod as an inescapable evil and was appointed by him president
of the Sanhedrin (30 b.c.). Its Pharisean majority loved him so well
that he remained head of the Great Council until his death (a.d. 10 ).
Out of respect for his memory the office was made hereditary in his
family for 400 years.</p>
<p>The Council gave its second place of honor to Hillel’s rival, the
conserva - tive rabbi Shammai. He taught a much stricter interpretation
of the Law, rejected divorce, and demanded the literal application of
the Torah, regardless of new conditions. This division of Jewish
teachers into con- servative and liberal groups had existed for a
century before Hillel, and con- tinued until the destruction of the
Temple.</p>
<p>V. THE GREAT EXPECTATION</p>
<p>The Jewish literature that has come down to us from this period is
almost entirely religious. Just as it seemed to the orthodox Hebrew a
profanation to make images of the deity, or to adorn his temples with
plastic art, so it seemed to him an error to write philosophy or
literature for any other ulti- mate purpose than to praise God and
glorify the Law. There were of course many exceptions, of which the
pretty story of Susannah may serve as an instance. It tells of a fair
Jewess falsely accused of unchastity by two unsatis - fied elders, and
freed through the skillful cross-examination of witnesses by a youth
named Daniel. Even this romance found its way into some editions of the
Book of Daniel.</p>
<p>The book of Joshua son of Sirach, which we know as Ecclesiasticus,
may be as late as this period; it is one of many Apocrypha — “hidden” or
unau -</p>
<p>• The Talmud attributes to Hillel’s reply the additional words, “This
is all the Law, the</p>
<p>j 4 o</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>thentic compositions not accepted into the Jewish canon of the Old
Testa- ment; rich in beauty and wisdom, it did not deserve to be
excluded from the company of Ecclesiastes and Job. In its twenty-fourth
chapter we find again, as in the eighth chapter of Proverbs, the
doctrine of the Logos or Incarnate Word: “Wisdom the first product of
God, created from the beginning of the world.” Between 1 30 b . c . and
a . d . 40 an Alexandrian Jew— or a number of Hellenistic Jews —
published a Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, which sought, like Philo, to
harmonize Judaism and Platonism, and called Hellen- izing Jews back to
the Law in prose as noble as any since Isaiah. A lesser work, the Psalms
of Solomon ( ca . 50 b . c .), is rich in anticipation of a Re- deemer
for Israel.</p>
<p>This hope of salvation from Rome and earthly suffering through the
coming of a divine Redeemer rings through nearly all the Jewish
literature of this age. Many productions took the form of apocalypses or
revelations, whose aim was to make the past intelligible and forgivable
by presenting it as a prelude to a triumphant future revealed to some
seer by God. The Book of Daniel, written about 165 b.c. to encourage
Israel against Antiochus Epiphanes, was still circulating among Jews who
could not believe that Yahveh would let them long remain under pagan
domination. The Book of Enoch, probably the work of several authors
between 170 and 66 b.c., took the form of visions vouchsafed to the
patriarch who, in Genesis (v, 24), had “walked with God.” It recounted
the fall of Satan and his cohorts, the con - sequent intrusion of evil
and suffering into human life, the redemption of mankind by a Messiah,
and the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. About 150 b.c. Jewish writers
began to publish Sibylline Oracles, in which various sibyls or
prophetesses were represented as defending Judaism against pagan- ism
and foretelling the final victory of the Jews over their enemies.</p>
<p>The idea of the saving god had probably come to western Asia from
Persia and Babylonia. 38 In the Zoroastrian creed all history and life
were represented as a war between the holy forces of light and the
diabolical powers of darkness; in the end a savior would come —
Shaosyant or Mithras — to judge all men and establish an everlasting
reign of righteousness and peace. To many Jews the rule of Rome seemed
part of the transient victory of evil. They denounced the greed,
treachery, brutality, and idolatry of “gentile” civilization and the
“atheistic” hedonism of an epicurean world. According to the Book of
Wisdom</p>
<p>the ungodly said: Our life is short and tedious, and in the death
of</p>
<p>a man there is no remedy; neither was there any man known to re-</p>
<p>turn from the grave. . . . For the breath in our nostrils is as
smoke,</p>
<p>and a little spark in the moving of our heart; which being ex-</p>
<p>tinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit
shall</p>
<p>54 1</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA</p>
<p>vanish as the soft air, and our name shall be forgotten, and our
life</p>
<p>shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, as a mist dispersed by
the</p>
<p>beams of the sun. . . . Come on, let us enjoy the good things
that</p>
<p>are present … let no flower of the spring pass us by; let us
crown</p>
<p>ourselves with rosebuds before they be withered; let us leave tokens
of our joyfulness in every place . 39</p>
<p>These epicureans reason falsely, says the author; they hitch their
wagon to a falling star, since pleasure is a vain and transitory
thing.</p>
<p>For the hope of the ungodly man is as chaff swept away by the wind,
and as thin hoar-frost scattered by the tempest; it passeth as the</p>
<p>remembrance of a guest who tarrieth but a day. But the righteous</p>
<p>shall live forever, and the care of them is with the Most High.
There- fore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a diadem of
beauty</p>
<p>from the hand of the Lord . 40</p>
<p>The reign of evil will be brought to an end, according to the
apocalyptic books, either by the direct intervention of God himself or
the earthly com- ing of his son or representative, the Messiah or
Anointed One.* Had not the prophet Isaiah, a century back foretold
him?</p>
<p>For unto us a child is bom, a son is given; and the government
shall</p>
<p>be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called . . . the
mighty</p>
<p>God, the Prince of Peace . 41</p>
<p>Many Jews agreed with Isaiah (xi, i) in describing the Afessiah as an
earthly king who would be bom of the royal house of David; others, like
the authors of Enoch and Daniel, called him the Son of Man, and pictured
him as com- ing down from heaven. The philosopher of Proverbs and the
poet of the Wisdom of Solomon , 42 perhaps influenced by Plato’s Ideas
or the Stoic anima nrundt , saw him as incarnate Wisdom, the
first-begotten of God, the Word or Reas on (logos) that would soon play
so great a role in Philo’s phi - losophy. Nearly all the apocalyptic
authors thought that the Afessiah would triumph speedily; but Isaiah in
a remarkable passage had conceived him as</p>
<p>despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief. . . . Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows</p>
<p>… he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniqui-</p>
<p>ties . , . and with his stripes we are healed. The Lord hath laid
upon</p>
<p>him the iniquity of us all. … He was taken from prison and from</p>
<p>judgment, and was cut off out of the land of the living. … He</p>
<p>bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors .

<p>All, however, agreed that in the end the Messiah would subdue the
heathen, free Israel, 44 make Jerusalem his capital, and win all men to
accept Yahveh and the Mosaic Law. 45 Thereafter a “Good Time” would come
of happiness for the whole world: all the earth would be fertile, every
seed would bear a thousandfold, wine would be plentiful, poverty would
disappear, all men would be healthy and virtuous, and justice, good
fellowship, and peace would reign over the earth. 40 Some seers thought
that this joyful age would be interrupted, that the powers of darkness
and evil would make a last assault upon the happy kingdom, and that the
world would be consumed in chaos and conflagration. In the final “Day of
God” the dead would rise and be judged by the “Ancient of Days”
(Yahveh), or by the “Son of Man,” to whom absolute and everlasting
dominion would then be given over a reno- vated world, the Kingdom of
God. The wicked would be cast down head- long and speechless “into
Hell,” 47 but the good would be received into unending blessedness.</p>
<p>Essentially the movement of thought in Judea was parallel with that
in the pagan theology of the time: a people that had once thought of the
future in terms of its national destiny lost its trust in the state and
thought of salva- tion in spiritual and individual terms. The mystery
religions had brought this hope to many millions in Greece, the Hellenic
East, and Italy; but nowhere was the hope so earnest, or its need so
great, as in Judea. The poor or be- reaved, the oppressed or scorned of
the earth, looked for some divine re- deemer of their subjection and
their suffering. Soon, said the apocalypses, a savior would come, and in
his triumph all just men would be lifted up, even out of the grave, into
a paradise of eternal bliss. Old saints like Simeon, mystic women like
Anna daughter of Phanuel, passed their lives about the Temple, fasting,
waiting, praying that they might look upon the Redeemer before they
died. A great expectation filled the hearts of men.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE REBELLION</li>
</ol>
<p>No people in history has fought so tenaciously for liberty as the
Jews, nor any people against such odds. From Judas Maccabee to Simeon
Bar Cocheba, and even into our own time, the struggle of the Jews to
regain their freedom has often decimated them, but has never broken
their spirit or their hope.</p>
<p>When Herod the Great died the nationalists, spuming the pacific
counsels of Hillel, declared a revolt against Herod’s successor
Archelaus, and encamped in tents about the Temple. Archelaus’ troops
slew 3000 of them, man y of whom had come to Jerusalem for the Passover
festival (4 b.c.). At the following feast of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA 543</p>
<p>Pentecost the rebels gathered again, and once more suffered great
slaughter; the Temple cloisters were burned to the ground, the treasures
of the sanctuary were plundered by the legions, and many Jews killed
themselves in despair. Patriot bands took form in the countryside, and
made life precarious for any supporter of Rome; one such band, under
Judas the Gaulonite, captured Sepphoris, the capital of Galilee. Varus,
governor of Syria, entered Palestine with 20,000 men, razed hundreds of
towns, crucified 2000 rebels, and sold 30,000 Jews into slavery. A
delegation of leading Jews went to Rome and begged Augustus to abolish
the kingship in Judea. Augustus removed Archelaus, and made Judea a
Roman province of the second class, under a procurator responsible to
the governor of Syria (a.d. 6).</p>
<p>Under Tiberius the troubled land knew a moment’s peace. Caligula,</p>
<p>wishing to make the worship of the emperor a unifying religion
throughout the Empire, ordered all cults to include a sacrifice to his
image, and bade the Jerusalem officials to install his statue in the
Temple. The Jews had compromised, under Augustus and Tiberius, by
sacrificing to Yahveh in the name of the emperor; but they were so
averse to setting up the graven image of a pagan in their Temple that
thousands of them, we are told, went to the governor of Syria and asked
to be slain in cold blood before the edict should be carried out. 40
Caligula eased the situation by dying. Impressed by Herod’s grandson
Agrippa, Claudius made him king of nearly all Pales - tine (41 ) ; but
Agrippa’s sudden death released another outburst of disorder, and
Claudius restored the procuratorial rule (44).</p>
<p>The men whom his mercenary freedmen chose for this office were mostly
incompetents or scoundrels. Felix, made procurator by his brother
Pallas, “governed Judea,” says Tacitus, “with the powers of a king and
the soul of a sla ve.” 60 Festus ruled more justly, but died in the
attempt. Albinus, if we may believe Josephus, plundered and taxed
assiduously, and made a fortune by releasing criminals from jail for a
consideration; “nobody remained in prison but those who gave him n
othing.” 01 Floras, says the same friend and admirer of the Romans,
behaved “like an executioner rather than a gov - ernor,” despoiled whole
cities, and not only stole on his own account, but connived at other
robberies if allowed to share the loot. These reports retain some odor
of war propaganda; doubtless the procurators complained that the Jews
were a very troublesome people to oppress.</p>
<p>Bands of “Zealots” and “Dagger - men” ( Sicarii ) were formed in
protest against this misrule. Their members, pledged to kill any
disloyal Jew, mingled in street gatherings, stabbed their appointed
victims from behind, and disappeared in the chaos of the crowd. 52 When
Floras took seventeen talents (1,200) from the Temple treasury, an angry
mob collected before the shrine and cried out for his dismissal; some
youths went about with</p>
<p>544 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>baskets begging alms for him as suffering from poverty. Fionas’
legions dispersed the assemblage, plundered hundreds of homes, and slew
the occu- pants; the leading rebels were scourged and crucified; on that
day, says Josephus, 3600 Jews were slain. 53 The old or well-to-do
Hebrews counseled patience, arguing that revolt against so powerful an
empire would be national suicide; the young or poor accused them of
connivance and cowardice. The two factions divided the city and nearly
every family; one seized the upper part of Jerusalem, the other the
lower, and each attacked the other with every weapon at hand. In 68 a
pitched battle was fought between the groups; the radicals won, and
killed 12,000 Jews, including nearly all the rich; 54 the revolt had
become a revolution. A rebel force surrounded the Roman garrison at
Masada, persuaded it to disarm, and then slaughtered every man of it. On
that day the gentiles of Caesarea, the Palestinian capital, rose in a
pogrom that slew 20,000 Jews; other thousands were sold into slavery. In
one day the gentiles of Damascus cut the throats of 10,000 Jews. 55 The
enraged revolutionists laid waste many Greek cities in Palestine and
Syria, burned some of them to the ground, and killed and were killed in
great number. “It was then common,” says Josephus, “to see cities filled
with dead bodies . . . unburied, those of old men mixed with infants,
and women lying among them without any cover.” 50 By September of 66 the
revolution had won Jerusalem and nearly all of Pales- tine. The peace
party was discredited, and most of its members now joined in the
revolt.</p>
<p>Among them was a priest named Josephus, then a young man of thirty,
energetic, brilliant, and endowed with an intellect capable of
transforming every desire into a virtue. Commissioned by the rebels to
fortify Galilee, he defended its stronghold, Jotopata, against
Vespasian’s siege, until on ly forty Jewish soldiers remained alive,
hiding with him in a cave. Josephus wished to surrender, but his men
threatened to kill him if he tried it. Since they preferred death to
capture, he persuaded them to draw lots to fix the order in which each
should die by the hand of the next; when all were dead but himself and
one other, he induced him to join him in surrender. They were about to
be sent to Rome in chains when Josephus prophesied that Vespasian would
be emperor. Vespasian released him, and gradually accepted him as a
useful adviser in the war against the Jews. When Vespasian left for
Alexandria, Josephus accompanied Titus to the siege of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The approach of the legions brought the defenders to a belated and
fanatical unity. Tacitus reckons that 600,000 rebels had gathered in the
city. “All who were capable of serving appeared in arms,” and the women
were not less martial than the men. 57 Josephus, from the Roman lines,
called upon the besieged to surrender; they branded him as a traitor,
and</p>

<p>fought to the last. Starving Jews made desperate sorties to forage
for food; thousands of them were captured by the Romans, and were
crucified; “the multitude of these was so great,” Josephus reports,
“that room was wanting for the crosses, and crosses were wanting for the
bodi es.” In the later stages of the five-month siege the streets of the
city were clogged with corpses; ghouls wandered about despoiling and
stabbing the dead; we are told that 1 16,000 bodies were thrown over the
walls. Some Jews swallowed gold pieces and slipped out from Jerusalem;
Romans or Syrians, capturing them, slit open their bellies, or searched
their offal, to find the coins. 68 Having taken half the city, Titus
offered what he thought were lenient terms to the rebels; they rejected
them. The flaming brands of the Romans set fire to the Temple, and the
great edifice, much of it of wood, was rapidly con- sumed. The surviving
defenders fought bravely, proud, says Dio, to die on Temple grounds. 60
Some killed one another, some fell upon their own swords, some leaped
into the flames. The victors gave no quarter, but slew all Jews upon
whom they could lay their hands; 97,000 fugitives were caught and sold
as slaves; many of them died as unwilling gladiators in the triumphal
games that were celebrated at Berytus, Caesarea Philippi, and Rome.
Josephus numbered at 1,197,000 the Jews killed in this siege and its
aftermath; Tacitus calculated them at 600,000 (a.d. 70). 00</p>
<p>Resistance continued here and there till 73, but essentially the
destruction of the Temple marked the end of the rebellion and of the
Jewish state. The property of those who had shared in the revolt was
confiscated and sold. Judea was almost shorn of Jews, and those that
remained lived on the edge of starvation. Even the poorest Jew had now
to pay to a pagan temple at Rome the half shekel that pious Hebrews had
formerly paid each year for the upkeep of the Temple at Jerusalem. The
high-priesthood and the San- hedrin were abolished. Judaism took the
form that it has kept till our own time: a religion without a central
shrine, without a dominant priesthood, without a sacrificial service.
The Sadducees disappeared, while the Pharisees and the rabbis became the
leaders of a homeless people that had nothing left but its synagogues
and its hope.</p>

<p>The flight or enslavement of a million Jews so accelerated their
spread through the Mediterranean that their scholars came to date the
Diaspora from the destruction of Herod’s Temple. We have seen that this
Di sper- sion had begun six centuries before in the Babylonian
Captivity, and had been renewed in the settling of Alexandria. Since
fertility was commanded</p>
<p>54&lt;5 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.XXV</p>
<p>and infanticide sternly forbidden by Jewish piety and law, the
expansion of the Jews was due to biological as well as economic causes;
Hebrews still played a very minor role in the commerce of the world.
Fifty years before the fall of Jerusalem, Strabo, with anti-Semitic
exaggeration, reported that “it is hard to find a single place on the
habitable earth that has not admitted this tribe of men, and is not
possessed by it.” 01 Philo, twenty years before the Dispersion,
described “the continents . . . full of Jewish settlements, and likewise
the . . . islands, a nd nearly all Babylonia.” 02 By a.d. 70 there were
thousands of Jews in Seleucia on the Tigris, and in other Parthian
cities; they were numerous in Arabia, and crossed thence into Ethiopia;
they abounded in Syria and Phoenicia; they had large colonies in Tarsus,
Antioch, Miletus, Ephesus, Sardis, Smyrna; they were only less numerous
in Delos, Corinth, Athens, Philippi, Patrae, Thessalonica. In the west
there were Jewish communities in Carthage, Syracuse, Puteoli, Capua,
Pompeii, Rome, even in Horace’ s native Venusia. All in all we may
reckon 7,000,000 Jews in the Empire — some seven per cent of the
population, twice their pro- portion in the United States of America
today. 03</p>
<p>Their number, dress, diet, circumcision, poverty, ambition,
prosperity, exclu- siveness, intelligence, aversion to images, and
observation of an inconvenient Sabbath aroused an anti-Semitism that
ranged from jokes in the theater and slurs in Juvenal and Tacitus to
murders in the street and wholesale pogroms. Apion of Alexandria made
himself the chief mouthpiece of these attacks, and Josephus answered him
in an incisive pamphlet.*</p>
<p>After the fall of Jerusalem Josephus sailed to Rome with Titus, and
accom- panied the conqueror of his people in a triumphal procession that
exhibited captive Jews and Jewish spoils. Vespasian gave him Roman
citizenship, a pension, an apartment in his palace, and profitable lands
in Judea. 05 In return Josephus took Vespasian’s family name Flavius,
and wrote The Wars of the Jews ( ca . 75) to defend the actions of Titus
in Palestine, to exonerate his own defection, and to discourage further
revolt by showing forth the might of Rome. In his later years (ca. 93),
feeling more keenly his isolation, he wrote The Antiquities of the Jews
to regain the good will of his people by giving gentiles a more
favorable view of Jewish achievements, customs, and character. His
narratives are clear and forceful, and his account of Herod the Great is
as engaging as Plutarch, but his bias and his aims impair his
objectivity. The Antiquities required many years and exhausted the
author’s strength; the last four of the twenty books were written by his
secretaries from his notes. 00 Josephus was still but fifty-six when the
work appeared, but he was already worn out by a life of adventure,
controversy, and moral solitude.</p>

<p>and cultural life in Palestine. Amid the siege of Jerusalem an aged
pupil of Hillel, Johanan ben Zakkai, fearful lest the carriage should
destroy all teachers and transmitters of the oral tradition, escaped
from the city, and set up an academy in a vineyard at Yabne, or Jamnia,
near the Mediterranean coast. When Jerusalem fell Johanan organized a
new Sanhedrin at Jamnia, composed not of priests, politicians, and rich
men, but of Pharisees and rabbis — i.e., teachers of the Law. This Bet
Din or Council had no political power, but most Palestinian Jews
recognized its authority in all matters of religion and morals. The
patriarch whom the Council chose as its head appointed the
administrative officers of the Jewish community, and had the power to
excommunicate recalcitrant Jews. The stern discipline of the Patriarch
Gamaliel II ( ca . 100) welded into unity first the Council, then the
Jews of Jamnia, then the Jews of Palestine. Under his leadership the
contradictory interpretations of the Law transmitted by Hillel and
Shammai were reviewed and voted on; those of Hillel were for the most
part approved, and were made binding upon all Jews.</p>
<p>Since the Law was now the indispensable cement of scattered and
state- less Jewry, the teaching of the Law became the chief occupation
of the synagogue throughout the Diaspora; the synagogue replaced the
temple, prayer replaced sacrifice, the rabbi replaced the priest.
Tannaim — expositors — interpreted one or another of the orally
transmitted laws ( Halacha ) of the Jews, usually supported it with
scriptural quotation, sometimes added to it, and illustrated it with
stories, homilies, or other material ( Haggada ). The most famous of the
Tannahn was Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph. At the age of forty (ca. a.d. 8o) he
joined his five-year-old son at school, and learned to read. Soon he
could recite the whole Pentateuch by heart. After thirteen years of
study he opened his own school under a fig tree in a village near
Jamnia. His enthusiasm and idealism, his courage and humor, even his
lusty dogmatism, brought him many students. When, in 95, word came that
Domitian was planning new measures against the Jews, Akiba was chosen
with Gamaliel and two others to make a personal appeal to the Emperor.
While they were in Rome Domitian died. Nerva heard their plea favorably,
and ended the fiscits ludaicns — the tax laid upon Jews for rebuilding
Rome. On his return to Jamnia Akiba set himself the lifelong task of
codifying the Halacha; his pupil Rabbi Meir and their successor Judah
the Patriarch (ca. 200) completed the undertaking. Even in this
classified form the Halacha remained part of the oral tradition, handed
down from generation to genera- tion by scholars and professional
memorizers — living textbooks of the Law. Akiba’s methods were as absurd
as his conclusions were sound; he derived liberal principles from a
weird exegesis in which every letter of the Torah, or written law, was
held to have a mysterious meaning; perhaps he had observed that men will
accept the rational only in the form of the mystical.</p>
<p>54^ CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.XXV</p>
<p>From Akiba came that painstaking organization and exposition of
theology and ethics which passed down through the Talmud to Maimonides,
and ultimately to the methods of the Scholastic philosophers.</p>
<p>In his ninetieth year, when he had grown weak and reactionary, Akiba
found himself, as in his youth, surrounded by revolution. In 1 1 5-16
the Jews of Cyrene, Egypt, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia rose once more
against Rome; the massacre of gentiles by Jews, and of Jews by Gentiles,
became the order of the day; 220,000 men, says Dio, were killed in
Cyrene, 240,000 in Cyprus; the figures are incredible, but we know that
Cyrene never recovered from the devastation, and that for centuries
thereafter no Hebrew was allowed in Cyprus. The uprisings were
suppressed, but the surviving Jews kept fiercely alive their hope of a
Messiah who would rebuild the Temple and restore them in triumph to
Jerusalem. Roman stupidity reanimated the revolt. In 130 Hadrian
declared his intention to raise a shrine to Jupiter on the site of the
Temple; in 1 3 1 he issued a decree forbidding circumcision and public
instruction in the Jewish Law. 67 Under the leadership of Simeon Bar Co-
cheba, who claimed to be the Messiah, the Jews made their last effort in
antiquity to recover their homeland and their freedom (132). Akiba, who
all his life had preached peace, gave his blessing to the revolution by
accept- ing Bar Cocheba as the promised Redeemer. For three years the
rebels fought valiantly against the legions; finally they were beaten by
lack of food and supplies. The Romans destroyed 985 towns in Palestine,
and slew 580,000 men; a still larger number, we are told, perished
through starvation, disease, and fire; nearly all Judea was laid waste.
Bar Cocheba himself fell in defending Bcthar. So many Jews were sold as
slaves that their price fell to that of a horse. Thousands hid in
underground channels rather than be captured; surrounded by the Romans,
they died one by one of hunger, while the living ate the bodies of the
dead. 08</p>
<p>Resolved to destroy the recuperative virility of Judaism, Hadrian
forbade not merely circumcision, but the observance of the Sabbath or
any Jewish holyday, and the public performance of any Hebrew ritual. 00
A new and heavier poll tax was placed upon all Jews. They were allowed
in Jerusalem only on one fixed day each year, when they might come and
weep before the ruins of their Temple. The pagan city of Aelia
Capitolina rose on the site of Jerusalem, with shrines to Jupiter and
Venus, and with palaestras, theaters, and baths. The Council at J amnia
was dissolved and outlawed; a minor and powerless Council was permitted
at Lydda, but public instruction in the Law was prohibited on pain of
death. Several rabbis were executed for disobeying this injunction.
Akiba, now ninety-five, insisted on teaching his pupils; he was
imprisoned for three years, but taught even in jail; he was</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) ROME AND JUDEA 549</p>
<p>tried and condemned, and died, we are told, with the basic tenet of
Judaism on his lips: “Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is
one.” 70</p>
<p>Though Hadrian’s decrees were softened by Antoninus Pius, the Jews
did not for centuries recover from the disaster of Bar Cocheba’s revolt.
From this moment they entered their Middle Ages, abandoning all secular
learning except medicine, renouncing every form of Hellenism, and taking
comfort and unity only from their rabbis, their mystic poets, and their
Law. No other people has ever known so long an exile, or so hard a fate.
Shut out from their Holy City, the Jews were compelled to surrender it
first to paganism, then to Christianity. Scattered into every province
and beyond, condemned to poverty and humiliation, unbefriended even by
philosophers and saints, they retired from public affairs into private
study and worship, passionately preserving the words of their scholars,
and preparing to write them down at last in the Talmuds of Babylonia and
Palestine. Judaism hid in fear and obscurity while its offspring,
Christianity, went out to conquer the world.</p>
