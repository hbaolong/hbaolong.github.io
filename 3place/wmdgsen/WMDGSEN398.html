<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>The Crisis in the Church</p>
<p>1378-1447</p>
<p>I. THE PAPAL SCHISM: I378-I417</p>
<p>G REGORY XI had brought the papacy back to Rome; but would it</p>
<p>stay there? The conclave that met to name his successor was com-</p>
<p>posed of sixteen cardinals, only four of whom were Italians. The
municipal authorities petitioned them to choose a Roman, or at least an
Italian; and to support the suggestion a crowd of Romans gathered
outside the Vati- can, threatening to kill all non-Italian cardinals
unless a Roman were made pope. The frightened conclave, by a vote of
fifteen to one, hastily elected (1378) Bartolommeo Prignano, Archbishop
of Bari, who took the name of Urban VI; then they fled in fear of their
lives. But Rome accepted the compromise. 1</p>
<p>Urban VI ruled the city and the Church with impetuous and despotic
energy. He appointed senators and municipal magistrates, and reduced the
turbulent capital to obedience and order. He shocked the cardinals by
an- nouncing that he proposed to reform the Church, and to begin at the
top. Two weeks later, preaching publicly in their presence, he condemned
the morals of the cardinals and the higher clergy in unmeasured terms.
He forbade them to accept pensions, and ordered that all business
brought to the Curia should be dispatched without fees or gifts of any
kind. When the cardinals murmured he commanded them to “cease your
foolish chat - tering”; when Cardinal Orsini protested the Pope called
him a “blockhead”; when the Cardinal of Limoges objected Urban rushed at
him to strike him. Hearing of all this, St. Catherine sent the fiery
Pontiff a warning: “Do what</p>
<p>The French cardinals gathered in Anagni, and planned revolt. On Au-
gust 9, 1378, they issued a manifesto declaring Urban’s election invalid
as</p>

<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>having been made under duress of the Roman mob. All the Italian
cardinals joined them, and at Fondi on September 20 the entire College
proclaimed Robert of Geneva to be the true pope. Robert, as Clement VII,
took up his residence at Avignon, while Urban clung to his pontifical
office in Rome. The Papal Schism so inaugurated was one more result of
the rising national state; in effect it was an attempt by France to
retain the vital aid of the papacy in her war with England and in any
future contest with Ger- many or Italy. The lead of France was followed
by Naples, Spain, and Scotland; but England, Flanders, Germany, Poland,
Bohemia, Hungary, and Portugal accepted Urban, and the Church became the
political play- thing of the rival camps. The confusion reached a pitch
that aroused the scornful laughter of expanding Islam. Half the
Christian world held the other half to be heretical, blasphemous, and
excommunicate. St. Catherine denounced Clement VII as a Judas;
St. Vincent Ferrer applied the same term to Urban VI. 3 Each side
claimed that sacraments administered by priests of the opposite
obedience were invalid, and that the children so bap- tized, the
penitents so shriven, the dying so anointed, remained in a state of
mortal sin, doomed to hell or limbo if death should supervene. Mutual
hatred rose to a fervor equaled only in the bitterest wars. When many of
Urban’s newly appointed cardinals plotted to place him in confinement as
a dangerous incompetent, he had seven of them arrested, tortured, and
put to death (1385).</p>
<p>His own death (1389) brought no compromise; the fourteen cardinals
surviving in his camp made Piero Tomacelli Pope Boniface IX, and the di-
vided nations prolonged the divided papacy. When Clement VII died (1394)
the cardinals at Avignon named Pedro de Luna to be Benedict XIII.
Charles VI of France proposed that both popes should resign; Benedict
re- fused. In 1399 Boniface IX proclaimed a jubilee for the following
year. Realizing that many potential pilgrims would be kept at home by
the chaos and insecurity of the times, he empowered his agents to give
the full in- dulgence of the jubilee to any Christian who, having
confessed his sins and done due penance, should contribute to the Roman
Church the sum that a trip to Rome would have cost him. The collectors
were not scrupulous theologians; many of them offered the indulgence
without requiring con- fession; Boniface reproved them, but he felt that
no one could make better use than he of money so secured; even amid the
acute pains of the stone, said his secretary, Boniface “did not cease to
thirst for gold.” 4 When some collectors tried to cheat him he had them
tortured till they disgorged. Other collectors were torn to pieces by
the Roman mob for letting Chris-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) THE CRISIS IN THE CHURCH 363</p>
<p>tians get the jubilee indulgence without coming to spend money in
Rome. 5 Amid the jubilee celebrations and solemnities the Colonna family
aroused the people to demand the restoration of republican government.
When Boniface refused, the Colonna led an army of eight thousand against
him; the aging pope stood siege resolute ly in Sant’ Angelo; the people
turned against the Colonna, the rebel army dispersed, and thirty-one
leaders of the revolt were jailed. One of them was promised his life if
he would serve as executioner of the rest; he consented, and hanged
thirty men, including his father and his brother. 8</p>
<p>On the death of Boniface and the election of Innocent VII (1404),
revolt broke out again, and Innocent fled to Viterbo. The Roman mob, led
by Giovanni Colonna, sacked the Vatican, smeared the emblems of Innocent
with mud, and scattered papal registers and historic bulls through the
streets (1405). 7 Then the people, bethinking themselves that Rome
without the popes would be ruined, made their peace with Innocent, who
returned in triumph and, a few days later, died ( 1406).</p>
<p>His successor, Gregory XII, invited Benedict XIII to a conference.
Ben- edict offered to resign if Gregory would do likewise; Gregory’s
relatives dissuaded him from consent. Some of his cardinals withdrew to
Pisa, and called for a general council to elect a pope acceptable to all
Christendom. The King of France again urged Benedict to resign; when
Benedict again refused, France renounced its allegiance, and adopted an
attitude of neu- trality. Deserted by his cardinals, Benedict fled to
Spain. His cardinals joined with those who had left Gregory, and
together they issued a call for a council to be held at Pisa on March
25, 1409.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE COUNCILS AND THE POPES: 1409-18</li>
</ol>
<p>Rebellious philosophers, almost a century before, had laid the
founda- tions of the “conciliar movement.” William of Occam protested
against identifying the Church with the clergy; the Church, he said, is
the congre- gation of all the faithful; that whole has authority
superior to any part; it may delegate its authority to a general
council, which should have the power to elect, reprove, punish, or
depose the pope. 8 A general council, said Marsilius of Padua, is the
gathered intelligence of Christendom; how shall any one man dare set up
his own intelligence above it? Such a council should be composed not
only of clergy but also of laymen elected by the people; and its
deliberations should be free from domination by the pope. 9 Heinrich von
Langenstein, a German theologian at the University of Paris,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>364</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>in a tract Concilium pads (1381), applied these ideas to the Papal
Schism. Whatever logic there might be (said Heinrich) in the arguments
of the popes for their supreme, God-derived authority, a crisis had
arisen from which logic offered no escape; only a power outside the
popes, and superior to the cardinals, could rescue the Church from the
chaos that was crippling her; and that authority could only be a general
council. Jean Gerson, chan- cellor of the University of Paris, in a
sermon preached at Tarascon before Benedict XIII himself, reasoned that
since the exclusive power of the pope to call a general council had
failed to end the Schism, that rule must be abrogated for the emergency,
and a general council must be otherwise sum- moned, and must assume the
authority to end the crisis. 10</p>
<p>The Council of Pisa met as scheduled. In the majestic cathedral
gathered twenty-six cardinals, four patriarchs, twelve archbishops,
eighty bishops, eighty-seven abbots, the generals of all the great
monastic orders, delegates from all major universities, three hundred
doctors of canon law, ambassa- dors from all the governments of Europe
except those of Hungary, Naples, Spain, Scandinavia, and Scotland. The
Council declared itself canonical (valid in Church law) and ecumenical
(representing the whole Christian world) — a claim which ignored the
Greek and Russian Orthodox Church. It summoned Benedict and Gregory to
appear before it; neither appearing, it declared them deposed, and named
the Cardinal of Milan as Pope Alex- ander V ( 1409). It instructed the
new Pope to call another general council before May, 1412, and
adjourned.</p>
<p>It had hoped to end the Schism, but as both Benedict and Gregory re-
fused to recognize its authority, the result was that there were now
three popes instead of two. Alexander V did not help matters by dying
(1410); his cardinals chose as his successor John XXIII, the most
unmanageable man to occupy the papal throne since his predecessor of
that name. Baldassare Cossa had been made papal vicar of Bologna by
Boniface IX; he had gov- erned the city like a condottiere, with
absolute and unscrupulous power; he had taxed everything, including
prostitution, gambling, and usury; accord- ing to his secretary, he had
seduced two hundred virgins, matrons, widows, and nuns. 11 But he was a
man of precious ability in politics and war; he had accumulated great
wealth, and commanded a force of troops personally loyal to him; perhaps
he could conquer the Papal States from Gregory, and reduce Gregory to
impecunious submission.</p>
<p>John XXIII delayed as long as he could to call the council decreed
at</p>
<p>Pisa. But in 141 1 Sigismund became King of the Romans, and the un-
crowned but generally acknowledged head of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) THE CRISIS IN THE CHURCH 365</p>
<p>He compelled John to call a council, and chose Constance for its seat
as free from Italian intimidation and open to Imperial influence. Taking
the initiative from the Church like another Constantine, Sigismund
invited all prelates, princes, lords, and doctors in Christendom to
attend. Everybody in Europe responded except the three popes and their
retinues. So many dignitaries came, at their own dignified leisure, that
half a year was spent in assembling them. When, finally, John XXIII
consented to open the Coun- cil on November 5, 1414, only a fraction had
arrived of the three patriarchs, twenty-nine cardinals, thirty-three
archbishops, one hundred and fifty bish- ops, one hundred abbots, three
hundred doctors of theology, fourteen university deputies, twenty-six
princes, one hundred and forty nobles, and four thousand priests who
were to make the completed Cduncil the largest in Christian history, and
the most important since the Council of Nicaea (325) had established the
creed of the Church. Where normally Constance had sheltered some six
thousand inhabitants, it now successfully housed and fed not only some
five thousand delegates to the Council, but, to attend to their wants, a
host of servants, secretaries, pedlars, physicians, quacks, min- strels,
and fifteen hundred prostitutes. 12</p>
<p>The Council had hardly formulated its procedure when it was faced</p>
<p>with the dramatic desertion of the Pope who had convened it. John
XXIII was shocked to learn that his enemies were preparing to present to
the as- sembly a record of his life, crimes, and incontinence. A
committee advised him that this ignominy could be averted if he would
agree to join Gregory and Benedict in a simultaneous abdication. 18 He
agreed; but suddenly he fled from Constance disguised as a groom (March
20, 1415), and found refuge in a castle at Schaff hausen with Frederick,
Archduke of Austria and foe to Sigismund. On March 29 he announced that
all the promises made by him in Constance had been drawn from him
through fear of violence, and could have no binding force. On April 6
the Council issued a decree — Sacrosancta — which one historian has
called “the most revolutionary official document in t he history of the
world”: 14</p>
<p>This holy synod of Constance, being a general council, and
legally</p>
<p>assembled in the Holy Spirit for the praise of God and for ending</p>
<p>the present Schism, and for the union and reform of the Church of</p>
<p>God in its head and its members . . . ordains, declares, and
decrees</p>
<p>as follows: First, it declares that this synod . . . represents
the</p>
<p>Church Militant, and has its authority directly from Christ; and</p>
<p>everybody, of whatever rank or dignity, including also the pope,
is</p>
<p>bound to obey this council in those things that pertain to the faith,
to</p>
<p>3 66</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>the ending of this Schism, and to a general reform of the Church
in</p>
<p>its head and members. Likewise it declares that if anyone, of
what-</p>
<p>ever rank, condition, or dignity, including also the pope, shall
refuse to obey the commands, statutes, ordinances, or orders of this
holy</p>
<p>council, or of any other holy council properly assembled, in
regard</p>
<p>to the ending of the Schism or to the reform of the Church, he
shall</p>
<p>be subject to proper punishment . . . and, if necessary, recourse
shall be had to other aids of justice. 15</p>
<p>Many cardinals protested against this decree, fearing that it would
end the power of the college of cardinals to elect the pope; the Council
overrode their opposition, and thereafter they played but a minor role
in its activities.</p>
<p>The Council now sent a committee to John XXIII to ask for his abdica-
tion. Receiving no definite answer, it accepted (May 25) the
presentation of fifty-four charges against him as a pagan, an oppressor,
a liar, a simoniac, a traitor, a lecher, and a thief; 16 sixteen other
accusations were suppressed as too severe. 17 On May 29 the Council
deposed John XXIII; and broken at last, he accepted the decree.
Sigismund ordered him confined in the castle of Heidelberg for the
duration of the Council. He was released in 1418, and found asylum and
sustenance, as an old man, with Cosimo de’ Medici.</p>
<p>The Council celebrated its triumph with a parade through Constance.
When it returned to business it found itself in a quandary. If it should
choose another pope it would be restoring the threefold division of
Chris- tendom, for many districts still obeyed Benedict or Gregory.
Gregory rescued the Council by an act at once subtle and magnanimous: he
agreed to resign, but only on condition that he should be allowed to
reconvene and legitimate the Council by his own papal authority. On July
4, 1415, the Council, so reconvened, accepted Gregory’s resignation,
confirmed the validity of his appointments, and named him legate
governor of Ancona, where he lived quietly the two remaining years of
his life.</p>
<p>Benedict continued to resist, but his cardinals left him and made
their peace with the Council. On July 26, 1417, the Council deposed him.
He retired to his family stronghold near Valencia, and died there at
ninety, still counting himself pope. In October the Council passed a
deer tt — Frequens — requiring that another general council should be
convened within five years. On November 17 an electoral committee of the
Council chose Car- dinal Oddone Colonna as Pope Martin V. All
Christendom accepted him, and after thirty-nine years of chaos the Great
Schism came to an end. The Council had now accomplished its first
purpose. But its victory on</p>
<p>THE CRISIS IN THE CHURCH</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>this point defeated its other purpose — to reform the Church. When
Mar- tin V found himself pope he assumed all the powers and prerogatives
of the papacy. He displaced Sigismund as president of the Council, and
with courteous and subtle address negotiated with each national group in
the Council a separate treaty of ecclesiastical reform. By playing off
each group against the others he persuaded each to accept a minimum of
reform, couched in carefully obscure language which each party might
interpret to save its emoluments and its face. The Council yielded to
him because it was tired. It had labored for three years, it longed for
home, and felt that a later synod could take up in sharper detail the
problem of reform. On April 22, 1418, it declared itself dissolved.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE TRIUMPH OF THE PAPACY: 1418-47</li>
</ol>
<p>Martin V, though himself a Roman, could not go at once to Rome; the
roads were held by the condottiere Braccio da Montone; Martin thought it
safer to stay in Geneva, then Mantua, then Florence. When at last he
reached Rome (1420), he was shocked by the condition of the city, by the
dilapidation of the buildings and the people. The capital of Christendom
was one of the least civilized cities in Europe.</p>
<p>If Martin continued a characteristic abuse by appointing his Colonna
relatives to places of income and power, it may be because he had to
strengthen his family in order to have some physical security in the
Vati- can. He had no army, but upon the Papal States, from every side,
pressed the armed forces of Naples, Florence, Venice, and Milan. The
Papal States, for the most part, had again fallen into the hands of
petty dictators who, though they called themselves vicars of the pope,
had assumed practically sovereign powers during the division of the
papacy. In Lombardy the clergy had for centuries been hostile to the
bishops of Rome. Beyond the Alps lay a disordered Christendom that had
lost most of its respect for the papacy, and grudged it financial
support.</p>
<p>Martin faced these difficulties with courage and success. Though he
had inherited an almost empty treasury, he allotted funds for the
partial re- building of his capital. His energetic measures drove the
brigands from the roads and Rome; he destroyed a robber stronghold at
Montelipo, and had its leaders beheaded. 18 He restored order in Rome,
and codified its com- munal law. He appointed one of the early
humanists, Poggio Bracciolini, to be a papal secretary. He engaged
Gentile da Fabriano, Antonio Pisa- nello, and Masaccio to paint frescoes
in Santa Maria Maggiore and St. John</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>in the Lateran. He named men of intellect and character, like
Giuliano Cesarini, Louis Allemand, Domenico Capranica, and Prospero
Colonna, to the college of cardinals. He reorganized the Curia to
effective functioning, but found no way to finance it except by selling
offices and services. Since the Church had survived for a century
without reform, but could hardly survive a week without money, Martin
judged money to be more urgently needed than reform. Pursuant to the
Frequens decree of Constance, he called a council to meet at Pavia in
1423. It was sparsely attended; plague compelled its transference to
Siena; when it proposed to assume absolute authority Martin ordered it
to dissolve; and the bishops, fearing for their sees, obeyed. To soothe
the spirit of reform Martin issued (1425) a bull detailing some
admirable changes in the procedure and financing of the Curia; but a
thousand obstacles and objections arose, and the proposals faded in the
quick oblivion of time. In 1430 a German envoy to Rome sent to his
prince a letter that almost sounded the tocsin of the Reformation:</p>
<p>Greed reigns supreme in the Roman court, and day by day finds</p>
<p>new devices . . . for extorting money from Germany under pretext</p>
<p>of ecclesiastical fees. Hence much outcry . . . and
heartburnings;</p>
<p>. . . also many questions in regard to the papacy will arise, or
else</p>
<p>obedience will at last be entirely renounced, to escape from
these</p>
<p>outrageous exactions of the Italians; and this latter course, as I
per-</p>
<p>ceive,’ would be acceptable to many countries. 19</p>
<p>Martin’s successor faced the acc umulated problems of the papacy from
the background of a devout Franciscan monk ill equipped for statesman-
ship. The papacy was a government more than a religion; the popes had to
be statesmen, sometimes warriors, and could rarely afford to be saints.
Eugenius IV was sometimes a saint. True, he was obstinate and dourly in-
flexible, and the gout that gave him almost constant pain in his hands
helped his sea of troubles to make him impatient and unsociable. But he
lived as- cetically, ate sparingly, drank nothing but water, slept
little, worked hard, attended conscientiously to his religious duties,
bore no malice against his enemies, pardoned readily, gave generously,
kept nothing for himself, and was so modest that in public he seldom
raised his eyes from the ground. 20 Yet few popes have earned so many
foes.</p>
<p>The first were the cardinals who had elected him. As the price of
their votes, and to protect themselves from such one-man rule as that of
Martin, they had induced him to sign capitula — literally, headings —
promising them</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE CRISIS IN THE CHURCH 369</p>
<p>freedom of speech, guarantees for their offices, control over half
the reve- nues, and consultation with them on all important affairs;
such “capitula - tions” set a precede nt regularly followed in papal
elections throughout the Renaissance. Furthermore, Eugenius made
powerful enemies of the Co- lonna. Believing that Martin had transferred
too much Church property to that family, he ordered restoration of many
parcels, and had Martin’s for - mer secretary tortured almost to death
to elicit information in the matter. The Colonna made war upon the Pope;
he defeated them with soldiery sent him by Florence and Venice, but in
the process he aroused the hostil- ity of Rome. Meanwhile the Council of
Basel, called by Martin, met in the first year (1431) of the new
pontificate, and proposed again to assert the supremacy of the councils
over the popes. Eugenius ordered it to dissolve; it refused, commanded
him to appear before it, and sent Milanese troops to attack him in Rome.
The Colonna seized the chance for revenge; they or- ganized a revolution
in the city, and set up a republican government (1434). Eugenius fled
down the Tiber in a small boat pelted by the popu- lace with arrows,
pikes, and stones. 21 He found refuge in Florence, then in Bologna; for
nine years he and the Curia were exiles from Rome.</p>
<p>The majority of the delegates to the Council of Basel were French.
They aimed, as the bishop of Tours frankly said, “e ither to wrest the
Apostolic See from the Italians, or so to despoil it that it will not
matter where it abides.” The Council therefore assumed one after another
the prerogatives of the papacy: it issued indulgences, granted
dispensations, appointed to benefices, and required that annates should
be paid to itself and not to the pope. Eugenius again ordered its
dissolution; it countered by deposing him (1439) and naming Amadeus VIII
of Savoy as Antipope Felix V; the</p>
<p>Schism was renewed. To complete the apparent defeat of Eugenius,
Charles VII of France convened at Bourges (1438) an assembly of French
prelates, princes, and lawyers, which proclaimed the supremacy of
councils over popes, and issued the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges:
ecclesiastical offices were henceforth to be filled through election by
the local chapter or clergy, but the king might make “recommendations”;
appeals to the Papal Curia were forbidden except after exhausting all
judicial possibilities in France; the collection of annates by the pope
was prohibited. 22 This Sanction in effect established an independent
Gallican Church, and made the king its master. A year later a diet at
Mainz adopted measures for a similar national church in Germany. The
Bohemian Church had separated itself from the papacy in the Hussite
revolt; the archbishop of Prague called the pope “the Beast of the
Apocalypse.” 23 The whole edifice of the Roman</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>Church seemed shattered beyond repair; the nationalistic Reformation
seemed established a century before Luther.</p>
<p>Eugenius was rescued by the Turks. As the Ottomans came ever nearer
to Constantinople, the Byzantines decided that Constantinople was worth
a Roman Mass, and that a reunion of Greek with Roman Christianity was an
indispensable prelude to securing military aid from the West. The Em-
peror John VIII sent an embassy to Martin V (1431) to propose a council
of both churches. The Council of Basel despatched envoys to John (1433),
explaining that the Council was superior in power to the pope, was under
the protection of the Emperor Sigismund, and would procure money and
troops for the defense of Constantinople if the Greek Church would deal
with the Council rather than with the Pope. Eugenius sent his own em-
bassy, offering aid on condition that the proposal of union should be
laid before a new council to be called by him at Ferrara. John decided
for Eugenius. The Pope summoned to Ferrara such of the hierarchy as were
still loyal to him; many leading prelates, including Cesarini and
Nicholas of Cusa, abandoned Basel for Ferrara, feeling that the matter
of prime im- portance was the negotiation with the Greeks. The Council
at Basel lin- gered on, but with mounting exasperation and declining
prestige.</p>
<p>The news that Christendom, divided between the Greek and the Roman
Churches since 1054, was now to be united stirred all Europe. On Feb-
ruary 8, 1438, the Byzantine Emperor, the Patriarch Joseph of Constanti-
nople, seventeen Greek metropolitans, and a large number of Greek
bishops, monks, and scholars, arrived at Venice, still partly a
Byzantine city. At Ferrara Eugenius received them with a pomp that must
have meant little to the ceremonious Greeks. After the opening of the
Council various commissions were appointed to reconcile the divergences
of the two Churches on the primacy of the pope, the use of unleavened
bread, the nature of the pains of purgatory, and the procession of the
Holy Ghost from the Father and/or the Son. For eight months the pundits
argued these points, but could come to no agreement. Meanwhile plague
broke out in Ferrara; Cosimo de’ Medici invited the Council to move to
Florence and be housed at the expense of himself and his friends; it was
so ordered; and some would date the Italian Renaissance from that influx
of learned Greeks into Florence (1439). There it was agreed that the
formula acceptable to the Greeks — that “the Holy Ghost proceeds from
the Father through the Son” (ex Patre per Filium procedit ) — meant the
same as the Roman formula, “proceeds from the Father and the Son” (ex
Patre Filioque procedit ); and by June 1439 an accord was reached on
purgatorial pains. The primacy of</p>

<p>the pope led to hot debates, and the Greek Emperor threatened to
break up the Council. The conciliatory Archbishop Bessarion of Nicaea
con- trived a compromise that recognized the universal authority of the
pope, but reserved all the existing rights and privileges of the Eastern
churches. The formula was accepted; and on July 6, 1439, in the great
cathedral that only three years before had received from Brunellesco its
majestic dome, the decree uniting the two Churches was read in Greek by
Bessarion and in Latin by Cesarini; the two prelates kissed; and all the
members of the Council, with the Greek Emperor at their head, bent the
knee before that same Eugenius who had seemed, so recently, the despised
and rejected of men.</p>
<p>The joy of Christendom was brief. When the Greek Emperor and his
suite returned to Constantinople they were met with insults and
ribaldry; the clergy and population of the city repudiated the
submission to Rome. Eugenius kept his part of the bargain; Cardinal
Cesarini was sent to Hun- gary at the head of an army to join the forces
of Ladislas and Hunyadi; they were victorious at Nish, entered Sofia in
triumph on Christmas Eve of 1443, and were routed at Varna by Murad II
(1444). The antiunion party in Constantinople won the upper hand, and
the Patriarch Gregory, who had supported union, fled to Italy. Gregory
fought his way back to St. Sophia, and read the decree of union there in
1452; but from that time the great church was shunned by the people. The
antiunion clergy anathema- tized all adherents of union, refused
absolution to those who had attended the reading of the decree, and
exhorted the sick to die without the sacra- ments rather than receive
them from a “Uniate” priest. 24 The patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch,
and Jerusalem repud iated the “robber synod” of Florence. 25 Mohammed II
simplified the situation by making Constanti- nople a Turkish capital
(1453). He gave the Christians full freedom of worship, and appointed as
patriarch Gennadius, a devoted foe of unity.</p>
<p>Eugenius returned to Rome in 1443, after his legate general, Cardinal
Vitelleschi, had suppressed the chaotic republic and the turbulent
Colonna with a ferocity unequaled by the Vandals or the Goths. The
Pope’s stay at Florence had acquainted him with the development of
humanism and art under Cosimo de’ Medici, and the Greek scholars who had
attended the Council of Ferrara and Florence had aroused in him an
interest in the preservation of the classic manuscripts that the
imminent fall of Constanti- nople might forfeit or destroy. He added to
his secretariat Poggio, Flavio Biondo, Leonardo Bruni, and other
humanists who could negotiate with the Greeks in Greek. He brought Fra
Angelico to Rome, and had him</p>

<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>paint frescoes in the Chapel of the Sacrament at the Vatican. Having
ad- mired the bronze gates that Ghiberti had cast for the Florentine
Baptistery, Eugenius commissioned Filarete to make similar doors for the
old church of St. Peter (1433). It was significant — though already it
aroused hardly any comment — that the sculptor placed upon the portals
of the chief church in Latin Christendom not only Christ and Mary and
the Apostles, but Mars and Roma, Hero and Leander, Jupiter and Ganymede,
even Leda and the swan. In the hour of his victory over the Council of
Basel Eugenius</p>
<p>brought the pagan Renaissance to Rome.</p>
