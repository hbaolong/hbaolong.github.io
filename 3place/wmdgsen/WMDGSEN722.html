xvm, held up the Republic as an ideal of greatness, and deplored the
Empire as a gay landslide to dissolution. Yet he recognized the corrup-
tion of politics in the Republic, and the political splendor of the
Empire under “the wisdom of Nerva, t he glory of Trajan, the valor of
Hadrian, and the virtue of the two Antonines”; 75 here Montesquieu gave
a lead to Gibbon and Renan in naming that period the noblest and
happiest in the history of government. In those philosopher-kings too
Montesquieu found the ethics of the Stoics, which he clearly preferred
to the Christian. His admiration for the Romans of the Republic passed
down to the French en- thusiasts of the Revolution, and shared in
changing French government, martial methods, and art.</h4>
<p>The book had some faults of a scholarship made hasty by the press of
time and the call of a larger task. Montesquieu was sometimes uncritical
in his use of classical texts; so, for example, he took as history
Livy’s chapters on Rome’s beginnings, whereas Valla, Glareanus, Vico,
and Pouilly had already rejected that account as legend. He
underestimated the economic factors behind the politics of the Gracchi
and Caesar. But against these shortcomings a larger view ranges the
eloquence, vigor, and concentration of the style, the depth and
originality of the thought, the bold attempt to see in one perspective
the rise and fall of a complete civilization, and to ele- vate history
from a record of details to the analysis of institutions and the logic
of events. Here was a challenge to historians, which Voltaire and Gibbon
would seek to meet; and here was that longing for a philosophy of
history which Montesquieu himself, after a generation of labor, would
try to satisfy with The Spirit of Laws.</p>
<p>3 . The Spirit of Laws</p>
<p>Fourteen years passed between the Considerations and UEsprit des
lois. Montesquieu had begun his chef- d’oeuvre about 1729, aged forty;
the essay on Rome was a by-product and interruption. In 1747, aged
fifty-six, he grew tired of the toil, and was tempted to abandon it:
“Often have I begun this work, and often have I laid it aside. I have a
thousand times cast to the winds the leaves that I had written.” 76 He
appeal ed to the Muses to sustain him: “I am running a long course, I am
weighed down with sadness and weariness. Pour into my soul the
persuasive charm that once I knew, but which now flies from me. You are
never so divine as when you lead us through pleasur e to wisdom and
truth.” 77 They must have responded, for he carried on. When at last the
task was done, he confessed his hesitations and his pride:</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XI have followed my object without forming a plan; I have known</p>
<p>neither rule nor exceptions; I have found the truth only to lose
it</p>
<p>again. But when I once discovered my principles, everything I sought
for came to me; and in the course of twenty years I have seen my work
begun, growing up, advancing toward completion, and finished. . . .</p>
<p>If this work meets with success I shall owe it chiefly to the
grandeur and majesty of the subject. However, I do not think that I have
been totally deficient in genius. . . . When I have seen what so many
great men in both France and Germany have written fon this subject〕
be-</p>
<p>fore me, I have been lost in admiration, but I have not lost my
courage;</p>
<p>I have said with Correggio, “And I too am a painter.” 78</p>
<p>He showed the manuscript to Helvetius, Henault, and Fontenelle. Fon-
tenelle thought the treatise lacked le bon genre of French style; 79
Helvetius begged the author not to ruin his reputation as a liberal by
publishing a book so lenient to many conservative beliefs. 80
Montesquieu judged these cautions irrelevant, and proceeded to print.
Fearing the French censorship, he sent the manuscript to Geneva; it was
published there in 1748 in two volumes, unsigned. When the French clergy
had ferreted out its heresies they condemned it, and a government order
forbade its distribution in France. In 1750 Malesherbes — future savior
of the Encyclopedic — became censor, removed the prohibition, and the
book rapidly made its way. Twenty-two editions were printed in two
years, and soon the work was translated into all the languages of
Christian Europe.</p>
<p>Titles in Montesquieu’s time were honestly, often laboriously,
explana - tory. So he called his book On the Spirit of Laws, or On the
Relations Which Must Exist between the Laws and the Constitution of Each
Gov- ernment, the Manners, Climate, Religion, Commerce, etc. It was an
essay on the relations between physical forces and social forms, and on
the inter- relations among the components of civilization. It tried to
lay the founda- tions for what we should now call “scientific”
sociology: to make possible — after the manner of research in the
natural sciences — verifiable conclusions illuminating present society
and conditionally predicting the future. It was, of course, too much for
one man to accomplish in the brevity of life and the existing state of
ethnology, jurisprudence, and historiography.</p>
<p>More specifically, Montesquieu’s thesis was that “the spirit of
laws”— i.e., their origin, character, and tendency — is determined first
by the climate and soil of the habitat, and then by the physiology,
economy, government, re- ligion, morals, and manners of the people. He
began with a broad defini- tion: “Laws, in their most general
signification, are the necessary relations arising from the nature of
things”; obviously he wished to bring the “nat - ural laws” of the
physical world, and the assumed regularities in history,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>under one general concept. Following Grotius, Pufendorf, and other
prede- cessors, he distinguished several kinds of laws: ( i ) natural
law, which he defined as “human reason so far as it governs all the
peoples of the earth” 81 — i.e., the “natural rights” of all men as
beings endowed with reason; (2) the law of nations in their relations
with one another; (3) political law, govern- ing the relations between
the individual and the state; and (4) civil law — the relations of
individuals with one another.</p>
<p>In the early stages of human society, Montesquieu thought, the basic
determinant of laws is the physical character of the terrain. Is it
jungle, desert, or arable? Is it inland or coastal? Is it mountainous or
plain? What is the quality of the soil, and the nature of the food it
yields? In a word, cli- mate is the first, and at first the most
powerful, factor in determining a people’s economy, its laws, and its
“national character.” (Bodin in the six - teenth century anticipated,
and Buckle in the nineteenth followed, Montes- quieu in this initial
emphasis.) For example, consider the climatic, and consequent human,
differences between north and south:</p>
<p>People are more vigorous in cold climates. . . . This superiority
of</p>
<p>strength must produce various effects: for instance, a greater
boldness, i.e., more courage; a greater sense of superiority, i.e., less
desire of re- venge; a greater sense of security, i.e., more frankness,
less suspicion, policy, and cunning. … I have been at the opera in
England and in</p>
<p>Italy, where I have seen the same pieces and the same performers; and
yet the same music produced such different effects on the two nations;
one is so cold and phlegmatic, and the other so lively and
enraptured.</p>
<p>… If we travel toward the north we meet with people who have few
vices, many virtues. … If we draw near the south we fancy our-</p>
<p>selves entirely removed from the verge of morality; here the
strongest passions are productive of all manner of crimes, each man
endeavoring, let the means be what they will, to indulge his inordinate
desires. . . .</p>
<p>In warm countries the aqueous part of the blood loses itself greatly
bv perspiration; it must therefore be supplied by a like liquid. Water
is</p>
<p>there of admirable uses; strong liquors would congeal the globules of
the blood which remains after the transuding of the aqueous humor.</p>
<p>In cold countries the aqueous part of the blood is very little
evacuated by perspiration. They must therefore make use of spirituous
liquors, without which the blood would congeal. . . . The law of
Mohammed, which prohibits the drinking of wine, is therefore fitted to
the climate of Arabia. . . . The law which forbade the Carthaginians to
drink</p>
<p>wine was a law of the climate. Such a law would be improper for cold
countries, where the climate seems to force them to a kind of national
intemperance. . . . Drunkenness predominates … in proportion to</p>
<p>the coldness and humidity of the climate. 82</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XOr consider the relations between climate and marriage:</p>
<p>Women, in hot countries, are marriageable at eight, nine, or ten</p>
<p>years of age. . . . They are old at twenty; their reason,
therefore,</p>
<p>never accompanies their beauty. When beauty demands the empire, the
want of reason forbids the claim; when reason is obtained, beauty is no
more. These women ought then to be in a state of dependency, for reason
cannot procure in old age that empire which even youth</p>
<p>and beauty could not give. It is therefore extremely natural that
in</p>
<p>these places a man, when no law opposes it, should leave one wife to
take another, and that polygamy should be introduced.</p>
<p>In temperate climates, where the charms of women are best pre-</p>
<p>served, where they arrive later at maturity, and have children at a
more advanced stage of life, the old age of their husbands in some
degree follows theirs; and as they have more reason and knowledge at
the</p>
<p>time of marriage 〔than their semitropical analogues〕 … it must</p>
<p>naturally introduce a kind of equality between the sexes, and in con-
sequence of this, the law of having only one wife. . . . That is the</p>
<p>reason why Mohammedanism 〔with polygamy〕 was so easily estab-
lished in Asia, and with such difficulty extended in Europe; why</p>
<p>Christianity is maintained in Europe, and has been destroyed in Asia;
and, in fine, why the Mohammedans have made such progress in China, and
the Christians so little . 83</p>
<p>At this point Montesquieu realizes that he has replaced Bossuet’s
Provi^ dence with climate, and hastens to add, for God’s sake, a saving
caution: “Human reasons, however, are subordinate to that Supreme Cause
who does whatever He pleases, and renders everything subordinate to His
will.” Some Jesuits thought that they saw Montesquieu’s tongue in his
cheek.</p>
<p>He soon resumed his reckless generalizations. In the “East” (Turkey,
Persia, India, China, Japan) the climate compels the seclusion of women,
for “the hot airs inflame the passions,” and would endanger polygamy as
well as monogamy if the sexes were as free to mingle as “in our
northern</p>
<p>Customs are more directly the result of climate than laws are, for
laws must sometimes seek to counter the effects of climate. As
civilization ad- vances, climatic factors are and must be more and more
controlled by moral or legal restraints, as in the Oriental seclusion of
women. And the wisest</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>35 1</p>
<p>legislators aim to balance “physical causes.” Customs are a function
of place and time; none is in itself right or wrong or best. By and
large, custom is the best law, since it is a natural adaptation of
character to situation. We must move slowly in trying to change a
custom. Usually a custom refuses to be changed by a law . 86</p>
<p>Since habitat determines custom, which determines national character,
the form of government will vary with the complex of all three. In gen-
eral it will depend upon the extent of the area ruled: a republic
comports with a small territory, whose leading citizens can assemble in
one place for deliberation or action; if the area expands it will
require more laws and wars, and will submit to monarchical rule.
Monarchy passes into despotism when it governs too much terrain; for
only despotic power can keep under subjection the local rulers of
distant provinces . 87 A monarchy must rest on “honor”; i.e., its
population must be ranged in ranks, and its citizens must be zealous for
distinction and preference. A republic must rest on a wide dissemination
of “virtue,” which Montesquieu defines in his own way as “the love of
one’s country— i.e., the love of equality .” 88</p>
<p>A republic may be either an aristocracy or a democracy, according as
it is ruled by only a part of the citizenry or by all. Montesquieu
admires Venice as an aristocratic republic, and the ancient city-states
as democra- cies; he knows but ignores the fact that in these the
enfranchised citizens were only a minority. He praises the rule
established by William Penn in America, and, still more
enthusiastically, the theocratic communism organ- ized by the Jesuits in
Paraguay . 89 To be real, however, an honest democ- racy must provide
economic as well as political equality; it should regulate inheritances
and dowries, and progressively tax wealth . 90 The best republics are
those in which the people, recognizing their incapacity to wisely deter-
mine policy, accept the policies adopted by the representatives whom
they have chosen.</p>
<p>A democracy should aim at equality, but it can be ruined by a
spirit</p>
<p>of extreme equality, when each citizen would fain be on a level with
those whom he has chosen to command him. . . . Where this is the</p>
<p>case virtue can no longer subsist in the republic. The people are de-
sirous of exercising the functions of the magistrates, who cease to be
revered. The deliberations of the senate are slighted; all respect is
then laid aside for the senators, and consequently for old age. If there
is no more respect for old age, there will be none presently for
parents;</p>
<p>deference to husbands will be likewise thrown off, and submission to
masters. This license will soon become general. . . . The people
fall</p>
<p>into this misfortune when those in whom they confided, desirous of
concealing their corruption, endeavor to corrupt them. . . . The</p>
<p>people will divide the public money among themselves, and, having</p>
<p>35 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xadded the administration of affairs to their indolence, will be for
blend- ing their poverty with the amusement of luxury. 91</p>
<p>And so, says the Baron, echoing Plato across two thousand years,
democ- racy falls into chaos, invites dictatorship, and disappears.</p>
<p>There are many passages in Montesquieu that favor an aristocratic re-
public, but he so feared the despotism that he thought potential in
democ- racy that he was willing to put up with monarchy if it ruled by
established laws. The shortest chapter in his book is on despotism, and
consists of three lines: “When the savages of Louisiana desire fruit,
they cut the tree to the root and gather the fruit. This is a symbol of
despotic government”; 92 i.e., the despot cuts down the ablest families
to safeguard his power. The exam- ples Montesquieu gave were safely
Oriental, but he was apparently fearful that the Bourbon monarchy was
tending toward despotism, now that Car- dinal Richelieu and Louis XIV
had destroyed the political power of the aristocracy. He spoke of the
Cardinal as “bewitched with the love of des- potic power.” 93 As a
French noble he strongly resented the reduction of his class to mere
courtiers of the king. He believed that “intermediate, subor - dinate,
and dependent powers” were necessary to a healthy monarchy; and by these
powers he meant the landed nobility and the hereditary magis- tracy, to
both of which he belonged. So he defended feudalism at great length (173
pages), sacrificing the unity and symmetry of his book. Alone among the
philosophers of eighteenth-century France he spoke with respect of the
Middle Ages, and made Gothic a term of praise. In the conflict that
continued throughout the reign of Louis XV between the monarch and the
parlements the embattled magistrates found an arsenal of argument in L’
Esprit des lois.</p>
<p>Montesquieu’s resentment of absolute monarchy as the vestibule to des
- potism led him to favor a “mixed government” of monarchy,
aristocracy,</p>
<p>In such a state there are always persons distinguished by their
birth, riches, or honors. Were they to be confounded with the common
peo- ple, and to have only the weight of a single vote like the rest,
the</p>
<p>common liberty would be their slavery, and they would have no
inter-</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>est in supporting it, as most of the popular resolutions would be
against them. The share they have, therefore, ought to be proportioned
to</p>
<p>their other advantages in the state; which happens only where they
form a body that has a right to check the licentiousness of the people,
as the people have a right to oppose any encroachment upon their</p>
<p>liberty. The legislative power is therefore committed to the body
of</p>
<p>the nobles, and to that which represents the people, each having its
assemblies and deliberations apart, each its separate interest and views
. 95</p>
<p>Each of the three powers in the government, and each of the two
chambers in the legislature, should serve as a check and balance against
the others. By this complex way the liberties of the citizen will be
reconciled with the wisdom, justice, and vigor of the government.</p>
<p>These ideas on mixed government had come down from Aristotle, but the
plan for a separation of powers had developed in Montesquieu’s mind from
his study of Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and Locke, and from his
experience in England. He thought he had found there, however imper-
fect, his ideal of a monarchy checked by democracy in the House of Com-
mons, this checked by aristocracy in the House of Lords; and he supposed
that the courts of England were an independent check on Parliament and
the king. He idealized what he had seen in England under the chaperonage
of Chesterfield and other nobles; but like Voltaire he used this
idealization as a spur to France. He must have known that the English
courts were not quite independent of Parliament, but he thought it good
that France should contemplate the right of the accused in England to an
early examination or release on bail, to be tried by a jury of his own
class, to challenge his ac- cusers, and to be exempt from torture. But
also he thought that “the nobil - ity ought not to be cited before the
ordinary court of judicature, but be- fore that part of the legislature
which is composed of their own body”; they too should have the right of
“being judged by their peers .” 98</p>
<p>Montesquieu, like nearly all of us, became increasingly conservative
with age. Conservatism is a function and obligation of old age, as
radicalism is a useful function of youth, and moderation a gift and
service of middle age; so we have a mixed constitution of a nation’s
mind, with a division and mutual checking of powers. With all his laud
of liberty as the true end of government, Montesquieu defined liberty as
“a right of doing whatever the laws permit. If a citizen could do what
they forbid he would no longer be possessed of liberty, because all his
fellow citizens would have the same power .” 97 And he agreed with his
fellow Gascon, Montaigne, in depre - cating revolutions:</p>
<p>When the form of government has been long established, and affairs
have reached a fixed condition, it is almost always prudent to leave</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xthem there; because the reasons — often complicated or unknown —
which have allowed such a state to subsist will still maintain it .
98</p>
<p>He rejected the idea of equality in property or power, but he felt
like the Gracchi about the concentration of land ownership.</p>
<p>With land sufficient to nourish a nation . . . the common people</p>
<p>have scarcely enough to nourish a family. . . . The clergy, the</p>
<p>prince, the cities, the great men, and some of the principal citizens
in- sensibly become proprietors of all the land which lies
uncultivated.</p>
<p>The families who are ruined have left their fields, and the laboring
man is destitute. In this situation they 〔the ruling classes〕 . . .
should dis-</p>
<p>tribute land to all the families that are in want, and procure them
ma- terials for clearing and cultivating it. This distribution ought to
be</p>
<p>continued as long as there is a man to receive it . 99</p>
<p>He condemned the farming of tax collecting to private financiers. He
de- nounced slavery with moral fervor and bitter irony . 100 He
acknowledged the occasional necessity of war, and stretched the concept
of defense to sanction pre-emptive war:</p>
<p>With a state the right of natural defense carries along with it
some-</p>
<p>times the necessity of attacking; as, for instance, when one sees
that a continuance of peace will enable another to destroy her, and that
to attack that nation instantly is the only way to prevent her own
des-</p>
<p>truction . 101</p>
<p>But he deprecated the competitive amassing of armament:</p>
<p>A new distemper has spread itself over Europe, infecting our princes,
and inducing them to keep up an exorbitant number of troops. It has its
redoublings, and of necessity becomes contagious. For as soon as one
prince augments his forces, the rest, of course, do the same; so that
nothing is gained thereby, but the public ruin . 102</p>
<p>Though he esteemed patriotism so highly as to identify it with
virtue, he had moments in which he dreamed of a larger ethic:</p>
<p>If I knew of something that was useful to myself but injurious to my
family, I would cast it from my mind. If I knew of something which</p>
<p>was useful to my family but not to my country, I would try to
forget</p>
<p>it. If I knew of something that was useful to my country but
injurious to Europe and the human race, I should regard it as a crime .
103</p>
<p>His ultimate ethic and secret religion were those of the ancient
Stoics:</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>Never were any principles more worthy of human nature, and more
proper to form the good man. … If I could for a moment cease to</p>
<p>think that I am a Christian, I should . . . rank the destruction of
the</p>
<p>sect of Zeno among the misfortunes that have befallen the human</p>
<p>race. … It was this sect alone that made citizens, this alone that
made great men, this alone great emperors. Laying aside for a moment re-
vealed truths, let us search through all nature, and we shall not find a
nobler object than the Antonines, not even Julian himself (a commen-
dation thus wrested from me will not render me an accomplice of his
apostasy). No, there has not been a prince, since his reign, more</p>
<p>worthy to govern mankind . 104</p>
<p>Visibly Montesquieu took care, in UEsprit des lois , to make his
peace with Christianity. He acknowledged God — “for what greater
absurdity could there be than a blind fatality which had brought forth
intelligent beings ?” 105 But he conceived this Supreme Intelligence a s
expressed in the laws of nature, and never interfering with them. “For
Montesquieu,” said Faguet, “God is the Spirit of Laws .” 106 He accepted
supernatural beliefs as a necessary support of a moral code uncongenial
to the nature of man. “It is proper there should be some sacred books to
serve for a rule, as the Koran among the Arabs, the books of Zoroaster
among the Persians, the Veda among the Indians, and the classics among
the Chinese. The religious code supplements the civil, and fixes
〔limits 〕 the extent of arbitrary sway .” 107 State and Church should
act as checks and balances to each other, but should always remain
separate; “this great distinction 〔is〕 the basis of the tranquillity
of nations .” 108 Montesquieu defended religion against Bayle , 109 but
he subjected it, like everything else, to the influence of climate and
na- tional character:</p>
<p>A moderate government is most agreeable to the Christian religion,
and a despotic government to the Mohammedan. . . . When a reli-</p>
<p>gion adapted to the climate of one country clashes too much with the
climate of another, it cannot be there established, and, if introduced,
it will be discarded . 110 . . . The Catholic religion is most agreeable
to monarchy, and the Protestant to a republic. . . . When the
Christian</p>
<p>religion . . . became unhappily divided into Catholic and
Protestant,</p>
<p>the people of the north embraced the Protestant, and those of the
south still adhered to the Catholic. The reason is plain: the people of
the</p>
<p>north have, and will forever have, a spirit of liberty and
independence, which the people of the south have not; and therefore a
religion which has no visible head is more agreeable . 111</p>
<p>While conceding the benefits of religion in gross, he berated it in
detail. He condemned the wealth of the clergy in France , 112 and wrote
“a most</p>
<p>356</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhumble remonstrance to the Inquisitors of Spain and Portugal” to
stop roasting heretics; he wa rned them that “if anyone in times to come
shall dare to assert that, in the age in which we live, the people of
Europe were civilized, you will be cited to prove that they were
barbarians.” 113 As a patriotic Gallican he laughed at papal
infallibility, and insisted that the Church should be subject to the
civil power. As to religious toleration he took a middle view: “When the
state is at liberty to receive or reject a new religion, it ought to be
rejected; when it is received it ought to be toler- ated.” 114 With all
his obeisance to the censor he remained a rationalist. “Reason is the
most perfect, the most noble, the most beautiful of all our faculties
〔la raison est le plus parfait, le plus noble, et le plus exquis de
tous les sens〕 .” lls Wha t better motto could the Age of Reason
display?</p>
<p>4 . Aftermath</p>
<p>The Spirit of Laws was soon recognized as a major event in French
liter- ature, but it met with criticism from both right and left. The
Jansenists and the Jesuits, normally at odds, united in condemning the
book as a subtle repudiation of Christianity. Said the Jansenist
Ecclesiastical News: “The parentheses that the author inserts to inform
us that he is a Christian give slight assurance of his Catholicism; the
author would laugh at our simplicity if we should take him for what he
is not”; and the reviewer ended with an appeal to the secular
authorities to take action against the book. 116 The Jesuits accused
Montesquieu of following the philosophy of Spinoza and Hobbes; in
assuming laws in history as in natural science, he left no room for
freedom of the will. Father Berthier, in the Jesuit Journal de Trevoux,
argued that truth and justice are absolute, not relative to place or
time, and that laws should be based on God-given universal principles,
rather than on diversities of climate, soil, custom, or national
character. 117 Montesquieu thought it wise to issue (1750) a Defense de
1 ’ Esprit des lois, in which he disclaimed atheism, materialism, and
determinism, and reaffirmed his Chris- tianity. The clergy remained
unconvinced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rising philosophes were also displeased. They
considered The Spirit of Laws as almost a manual of conservatism; they
resented its occasional piety, the moderation of its proposed reforms,
and its halfhearted conception of religious toleration. 118 Helvetius
wrote to Montesquieu chid- ing him with laying too much emphasis on the
dangers and difficulties of social change. 119 Voltaire, who was
preparing his own philosophy of history in the Essai sur les moeurs, was
not enthusiastic over Montesquieu’s achievement. He had not forgotten
that Monsieur le President had opposed his admission to the Academy with
the words, “It would be a disgrace to</p>
<p>CHAP, x)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>the Academy if Voltaire were a member, and it will one day be his
disgrace that he was not one.” 120 Under the circumstances Voltaire’s
criticism was restrained, and was dammed with considerable praise. He
argued that Mon- tesquieu had exaggerated the influence of climate; he
noted that Christian- ity had originated in hot Judea and was still
flourishing in chilly Norway; and he thought it more likely that England
had gone Protestant because Anne Boleyn was beautiful than because Henry
VIII was cold. 121 If, as Montesquieu had suggested, the spirit of
liberty rose chiefly in mountain regions, how explain the sturdy Dutch
Republic, or the liberum veto of the Polish lords? In his Philosophical
Dictionary (1764) Voltaire filled pages with examples indicating that
“climate has some influence, govern - ment a hundred times more,
religion and government combined more still.” 122</p>
<p>We might ask those who maintain that climate does everything</p>
<ul>
<li>Montesquieu had not claimed this〕, why the Emperor Julian, in
his</li>
</ul>
<p>Misopogon , says that what pleased him in the Parisians was the
gravity of their character and the severity of their manners; and why
these</p>
<p>Parisians, without the slightest change of climate, are now like
playful children, whom the government punishes and smiles at at the same
mo- ment, and who themselves, the moment after, also smile and sing lam-
poons upon their masters . 123</p>
<p>Voltaire found it</p>
<p>melancholy that in so many citations and so many maxims the con-</p>
<p>trary of what is asserted should be almost always the truth. . . .
“Peo - ple of warm climates are timid, like old men; those of cold
countries are courageous, like young ones”? We should take great care
how</p>
<p>general propositions escape us. No one has ever been able to make a
Laplander or an Eskimo warlike, while the Arabs in fourscore years</p>
<p>conquered a territory which exceeded that of the whole Roman Em- pire
. 124</p>
<p>And then the praise:</p>
<p>After thus convincing ourselves that errors abound in The Spirit
of</p>
<p>Laws , . . . that this work wants method, and possesses neither
plan</p>
<p>nor order, it is proper to ask what really forms its merit and has
led to its great reputation. In the first place, it is written with
great wit, whilst the authors of all the other books on this subject are
tedious. It was on this account that a lady 〔Mme. du Deffand〕, who
possessed as much wit as Montesquieu, observed that his book was V
esprit sur les lois 〔wit about laws〕; it can never be more correctly
defined. A still. stronger</p>
<p>35 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xreason is that the book exhibits grand views, attacks tyranny,
supersti- tion, and grinding taxation. . . . Montesquieu was almost
always in</p>
<p>error with the learned, because he was not learned; but he was almost
always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery. Europe
owes him eternal gratitude . 125</p>
<p>And he added, elsewhere: “Humanity had lost its title deeds 〔to
freedom j, and Montesquieu recovered them .” 126</p>
<p>Later criticism has largely agreed with Voltaire, while checking his
own exaggerations . 127 It is true that The Spirit of Laws was poorly
constructed, with little logic in the arrangement and sequence of the
topics, and frequent forgetting of the unifying theme. In his zeal to be
a scientist, to accumulate and interpret facts, Montesquieu ceased at
times to be an artist; he lost the whole in the parts instead of
co-ordinating the parts into a harmonious whole. He had gathered his
data over half a lifetime; he wrote his book during twenty years; its
sporadic composition injured its unity. He general- ized too readily
from a few instances, and did not look about him for con- trary
instances — e.g., Catholic Ireland in the cold and “therefore”
Protestant</p>
<p>Against these faults there must have been great virtues to give the
book its acclaim and influence. Voltaire rightly signalized the style.
This too, however, suffered from fragmentation. Montesquieu indulged a
liking for short chapters, perhaps as a means of emphasis, as in the
“chapter” on des - potism; the result is unpleasantly staccato,
obstructing the flow of thought. Part of this fragmentation may have
been due to progressive weakening of his eyes, compelling him to dictate
instead of writing. When he let himself go and spoke out, he achieved,
with crisp and pithy sentences, some of the brilliance that had
brightened the Lettres per sane s. Voltaire thought there were more
epigrams in V Esprit des lois than befitted a work on law. (“In Venice,”
said Montesquieu, “they are so habituated to parsimony that none but
courtesans can make them part with their money.” 128 ) It is
nevertheless a magistral style, moderate and calm. It is occasionally
obscure, but it re- pays unraveling.</p>
<p>Montesquieu was modest and right in ascribing part of the value of
the</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>book to its subject and aim. To find laws in laws, some system in
their variation in place and time, to enlighten rulers and reformers by
consider- ing the sources and limits of legislation in view of the
nature and place of states and men — this was a majestic enterprise,
whose scope made faults forgivable. Herbert Spencer failed in the same
enterprise 129 1 48 years later, despite a corps of research aides, and
because of a similar passion for gen- eralization; but both attempts
were increments of wisdom. Montesquieu’s achievement was the greater. He
had predecessors;* he did not inaugurate, but he powerfully advanced the
historical method for the comparative study of institutions. He
anticipated Voltaire in establishing a philosophy of history independent
of supernatural causes; and he achieved a breadth and impartial) .y of
view never reached by Voltaire. Burke called Montes- quieu “the g:
latest genius which has enlightened this age”; 130 Taine con - sidered
him “the best instructed, the most sagacious, and the be st balanced of
aU the spirits of the time.” 131 Horace Walpole thought The Spirit of
Law: “the best book that ever was written.” 132 Perhaps not, but it was
the greatest book of the generation.</p>
<p>It exhausted its author. He wrote to a friend in 1749: “I confess
that this work has nearly killed me. I shall rest; I shall toil no
more.” 133 He continued to study nevertheless. “Study has been for me,”
he said, “the sovereign remedy against all the disappointments of life.
I have never known any trouble t hat an hour’s reading would not
dissipate.” 134</p>
<p>He visited Paris occasionally, and enjoyed his fame, which at that
time (1748) equaled Voltaire’s. “ The Spirit of Laws,” said Raynal, “has
turned the heads of the whole French people. We find this work in the
libraries of our scholars and on the dressing tables of our ladies and
our fashionable young men.” 135 He was again welcomed in the salons, and
he was received at court. But for the most part he stayed at La Brede,
content to be a grand seigneur. His book so pleased the English that
they sent in large orders for the wine grown on his lands. In his last
years he became almost blind. “It seems to me,” he said, “that the
little light left to me is but the dawning of the day when my eyes will
close forever.” 136 In 1754 he went to Paris to end the lease on his
house there; but on that visit he developed pneu- monia and died,
February 10, 1755, aged sixty-six. He had received the last rites of the
Catholic Church, but the agnostic Diderot was the only man of letters
who attended his funeral. 137 His influence spread over centuries. “In
the forty years since the publication of The Spirit of Laws,” wrote
Gibbon, “no work has been more read and criticized, and the spirit of
inquiry which it has excited is not the least of our obligations to the
author.” 138 Gibbon,</p>

<p>XBlackstone, and Burke were among the English writers who profited
from The Spirit of Laws and The Greatness and Decadence of the Romans.
Frederick the Great thumbed V Esprit des lois only next to The Prince;
Catherine the Great thought it should be “the breviary of sovereigns ,”
139 and made extracts from it for the men whom she appointed to revise
Rus- sia’s laws . 140 The framers of the American Constitution took from
Mon - tesquieu not only the separation of governmental powers but the
exclusion of cabinet members from Congress; and their writings were
interspersed with quotations from his work. The Spirit of Laws became
almost the bible of the moderate leaders in the French Revolution, and
from The Greatness and Decadence came, in part, their admiration for the
Roman Republic. “All the great modern ideas,” said Faguet, “have their
commencement in Montesquieu .” 141 For a generation it was Montesquieu,
not Voltaire, who was the voice and hero of the mind of France.</p>
