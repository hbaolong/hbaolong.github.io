<h4 id="chapter-ii-the-national-assembly">CHAPTER II The National
Assembly</h4>
<p>May 4, 1 789 — September 30, 1791</p>
<p>I. THE STATES-GENERAL</p>
<p>O N May 4 the 621 deputies of the Third Estate, dressed in bourgeois
black, followed by 285 nobles under plumed hats and in cloth of lace and
gold, then by 308 of the clergy — their prelates distinguished by velvet
robes — then by the King’s ministers, and his family, then by Louis XVI
and Marie Antoinette, all accompanied by troops and inspired by banners
and bands, marched to their designated meeting place, the Hotel des
Menus Plaisirs (Hall of Minor Diversions), a short distance from the
royal palace at Versailles. A proud and happy crowd flanked the
procession; some wept with joy and hope, 1 seeing in that apparent union
of the rival orders a prom- ise of concord and justice under a
benevolent king.</p>
<p>Louis addressed the united delegates with a confession of near-bank-
ruptcy, which he attributed to a “costly but honorable war”; he asked
them to devise and sanction new means of raising revenue. Necker
followed with three hours of statistics, which made even revolution
dull. On the next day the unity faded; the clergy met in an adjoining
smaller hall, the nobles in another; each order, they felt, should
deliberate and vote apart, as in that last States-General, 175 years
ago; and no proposal should become law without receiving the consent of
each order and the King. To let the indi- vidual votes of the
congregated deputies decide the issues would be to sur- render
everything to the Third Estate; it was already evident that many of the
poorer clergy would side with the commoners, and some nobles — Lafay-
ette, Philippe d’Orleans, and the Due de La Rochefoucauld -Liancourt —
entertained dangerously liberal sentiments.</p>
<p>A long war of nerves ensued. The Third Estate could wait, for new
taxes required their approval to get public acceptance, and the King was
waiting anxiously for those taxes. Youth, vitality, eloquence, and
determination were with the commoners. Honore-Gabriel- Victor Riqueti,
Comte de Mirabeau, brought them his experience and courage, the power of
his mind and his voice; Pierre-Samuel du Pont de Nemours offered his
knowledge of Physio- crat economics; Jean-Joseph Mounier and Antoine
Bamave brought them legal knowledge and strategy; Jean Bailly, already
famous as an astronomer, cooled with his calm judgment their excited
deliberations; and Maximilien de Robespierre spoke with the persistent
passion of a man who would not be silent until he had his way.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>H</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Born in Arras in 1758, Robespierre had now only five years to live,
but in most of these he would move near or at the center of events. His
mother died when he was seven; his father disappeared into Germany; the
four or- phans were brought up by relatives. An earnest and avid
student, Maximilien won a scholarship at the College Louis-le-Grand in
Paris, took his degree in law, practiced at Arras, and acquired such
repute for his advocacy of re- forms that he was among those sent from
the province of Artois to the States-General.</p>
<p>He had no advantages of appearance to reinforce his oratory. He was
only five feet three inches tall — nis sole concession to brevity. His
face was broad and flat, and pitted with smallpox; his eyes, weak and
spectacled, were of a greenish blue that gave Carlyle some excuses for
calling him “the sea- green Robespierre.” He spoke for democracy, and
defended adult male suffrage, despite warnings that this might make the
lowest common de- nominator the rule and standard of all. He lived as
simply as a proletaire, but he did not imitate the trousered
sansculottes; he dressed neatly in dark- blue tailcoat, knee breeches,
and silk stockings; and he rarely left home before dressing and
powdering his hair. He roomed with the carpenter Maurice Duplay in the
Rue St.-Honore; he dined at the family table, and managed on his
deputy’s pay of eighteen francs a day. From that foot of earth he was
soon to move most of Paris, later most of France. He talked too
frequently of virtue, but he practiced it; stern and obdurate in public,
in his private relatio ns “he was generous, compassionate, and ever
willing to serve”; so said Filippo Buonarrotti, who knew him well. 2 He
seemed quite immune to the charms of women; he spent his affection upon
his younger brother Augustin and Saint-Just; but no one ever impugned
his sexual morality. No gift of money could bribe him. When, in the
Salon of 1791, an artist ex- hibited a portrait of him simply inscribed
“The Incorruptible,” 3 no one seems to have challenged the term. He
thought of virtue in Montesquieu’s sense, as the indispensable basis of
a successful republic; without unpurchas- able voters and officials
democracy would be a sham. He believed, with Rousseau, that all men are
by nature good, that the “general will” should be the law of the state,
and that any persistent opponent of the general will might without qualm
be condemned to death. He agreed with Rousseau that some form of
religious belief was indispensable to peace of mind, to social order,
and to the security and survival of the state.</p>
<p>Not till near his end did he seem to doubt the full identity of his
judg- ment with the popular will. His mind was weaker than his will;
most of his ideas were borrowed from his reading, or from the catchwords
that filled the revolutionary air; he died too young to have acquired
sufficient experi- ence of life, or knowledge of history, to check his
abstract or popular con- ceptions with patient perception or impartial
perspective. He suffered se- verely from our common failing — he could
not get his ego out of the way of his eyes. The passion of his utterance
convinced himself; he became danger- ously certain and ludicrously vain.
“That man,” said Mirabeau, “will go far; he believes all that he says.”
4 He wen t to the guillotine.</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>In the National Assembly, in its two and a half years, Robespierre
made some five hundred speeches, 5 usually too long to be convincing,
and too argumentative to be eloquent; but the masses of Paris, learning
of their tenor, loved him for them. He opposed racial or religious
discrimination, proposed emancipation of the blacks, 6 and became, till
his final months, the tribune and defender of the people. He accepted
the institution of private property, but wished to universalize
small-scale ownership as an economic basis for a sturdy democracy. He
called inequality of wealth “a necessary and incur - able evil,” 7
rooted in the natural inequality of human ability. In this period he
supported the retention of the monarchy, properly limited; an attempt to
overthrow Louis XVI, he thought, would lead to such chaos and bloodshed
as would end in a dictatorship more tyrannical than a king. 8</p>
<p>Nearly every deputy heard the young orator impatiently except Mira-
beau, who respected the careful preparation and exposition of
Robespierre’s arguments. Elsewhere 9 we have watched Mirabeau growing up
painfully under a brilliant but brutal father, avidly absorbing every
available influence of life in travel, adventure, and sin; seeing human
frailty, injustice, poverty, and suffering in a dozen cities; imprisoned
by the King at his father’s re - quest, pillorying his enemies in
vituperative pamphlets or passionate appeals; and at last, in a lusty
and double triumph, elected to the States-General by the Third Estate of
both Marseilles and Aix-en-Provence, and coming to Paris as already one
of the most famous, colorful, and suspected men in a country where
crisis was evoking genius as rarely in history before. All lit- erate
Paris welcomed him; heads appeared at windows to watch his carriage
pass; women were excited by rumors of his amours, and were fascinated as
well as repelled by the scars and distortions of his face. The deputies
lis- tened in thrall to his oratory, though they were suspicious of his
class, his morals, his aims. They had heard that he lived beyond his
means, drank beyond reason, and was not above selling his eloquence to
mitigate his debts; but they knew that he berated his class in defense
of commoners, they ad- mired nis courage, and doubted they would ever
see such a volcano of energy again.</p>
<p>There was more oratory in those hectic days, and more political
maneu- vering than the Hotel des Menus Plaisirs could house, and they
overflowed in journals, pamphlets, placards, and clubs. Some delegates
from Brittany formed the Club Breton; soon it opened its membership to
other deputies, and to other wielders of tongue or pen; Sieyes,
Robespierre, and Mirabeau made it a sounding board and testing place for
their ideas and schemes; here was the first form of that powerful
organization that would later be called the Jacobins. Freemason lodges
were active, too, usually on the side of con- stitutional monarchy; but
there is no evidence of a secret Freemason con- spiracy. 10</p>
<p>Perhaps it was in the Club Breton that Sieyes and others planned the
strategy by which the nobles and the clergy were to be drawn into united
action with the Third Estate. Sieyes reminded the commonalty that it
com- prised 24 million out of the 25 million souls in France; why should
it longer</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>hesitate to speak for France? On June 1 6 he proposed to the deputies
in the Menus Plaisirs that they should send a final invitation to the
other orders to join them, and that, if they refused, the delegates of
the Third Estate should declare themselves the representatives of the
French nation, and proceed to legislate. Mirabeau objected that the
States-General had been summoned by the King, was legally subject to
him, and could legally be dismissed at his will; for the first time he
was shouted down. After a night of argument and physical combat the
question was put to the vote: “Shall this meeting de - clare itself the
National Assembly?” The count was 490 for, 90 against. The delegates had
pledged themselves to a constitutional government. Politically the
Revolution had begun, June 17, 1789.</p>
<p>Two days later the clerical order, separately assembled, voted 149 to
137 to merge with the Third Estate; the lower clergy was casting its lot
with the commonalty that it knew and served. Shocked by this desertion,
the hierarchy joined the nobility in an appeal to the King to prevent
the union of the orders, if necessary by dismissing the Estates. Louis
responded, on the evening of June 19, by ordering the Hotel des Menus
Plaisirs to be closed at once to permit its preparation for seating the
three orders at a “royal session” to be held on June 22. When the
deputies of the Third Estate ap - peared on the twentieth they found the
doors locked. Believing that the King intended to dismiss them, they
gathered in a nearby tennis court (Salle du Jeu de Paume); Mounier
proposed to the 577 deputies gathered there that each should sign an
oath “never to separate, and to meet wherever cir - cumstances might
require, until a constitution should be firml y established.” All but
one of the delegates took this oath, in an historic scene that Jacques-
Louis David would soon depict in one of the major paintings of that age.
From that time the National Assembly was also the Constituent
Assembly.</p>
<p>Postponed for a day, the royal session opened on June 23. To the
united gathering the King had an aide read, in his presence, a statement
reflecting nis conviction that without the protection of the nobility
and the Church he would be reduced to political impotence. He rejected
as illegal the claim of the Third Estate to be the nation. He agreed to
end the corvee, lettres de cachet, internal traffic tolls, and all
vestiges of serfdom in France; but he would veto any proposal that
impaired “the ancient and const itutional rights… of property, or the
honorific privileges of the first two orders.” He prom - ised equality
of taxation if the higher orders consented. Matters concerning religion
or the Church must receive the approval of the clergy. And he ended with
a reassertion of absolute monarchy:</p>
<p>If, by a fatality which I am far from anticipating, you were to
abandon me in this great enterprise, I alone would provide for the
welfare of my people. I alone should regard myself as their true
representative…. Consider, gentle- men, that none of your projects can
have the force of law without my special approbation…. I order you,
gendemen, to disperse at once, and to appear tomorrow morning each in
the room set apart for his own order. 11</p>
<p>The King, most of the nobles, and a minority of the clergy left the
hall. The Marquis de Breze, grandmaster, announced the King’s will that
the</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>room should be cleared. Bailly, president of the Assembly, replied
that the assembled nation could not accept such an order, and Mirabeau
thundered to Breze, “Go and tell those who sent you that we are here by
the will of the people, and will leave our places only if compelled by
armed force.” 12 It was not strictly true, since they had come by
invitation of the King, but the delegates expressed their sense of the
matter by crying out, “That is the will of the Assembly.” When troops of
the Versailles Garde du Corps tried to enter the hall a group of liberal
nobles, including Lafayette, barred the entrance with their drawn
swords. The King, asked what should be done, said wearily, “Let them
stay.”</p>
<p>On June 25 the Due d’Orleans led forty -seven nobles to join the
Assem- bly; they were greeted with a delirium of joy, which was
enthusiastically echoed in and around the Palais-Royal. Soldiers of the
Garde Frangaise fraternized there with the revolutionary throng. On that
same day the capi- tal had its own peaceful revolution: the 407 men who
had been chosen by the Paris sections to select the deputies for Paris
met at the Hotel de Ville and appointed a new municipal council; the
royal council, lacking military support, peaceably abdicated. On June 27
the King, yielding to Necker and circumstance, bade the upper orders to
unite with the triumphant Assembly. The nobles went, but refused to take
part in the voting, and soon many of them retired to their estates.</p>
<p>On July 1 Louis summoned ten regiments, mostly German or Swiss, to
come to his aid. By July 10 six thousand troops under Marechal de
Broglie had occupied Versailles, and ten thousand under Baron de
Besenval had taken up positions around Paris. Amid turmoil and terror,
the Assembly pro- ceeded to consider the report that had been submitted
on July 9 for a new constitution. Mirabeau begged the deputies to retain
the King as a bulwark against social disorder and mob rule. He pictured
Louis XVI as a man of good heart and generous intentions, occasionally
confused by shortsighted counselors; and he asked, prophetically:</p>
<p>Have these men studied, in the history of any people, how revolutions
com- mence and how they are carried out? Have they observed by what a
fatal chain of circumstances the wisest men are driven far beyond the
limits of mod- eration, and by what terrible impulses an enraged people
is precipitated into excesses at the very thought of which they would
have shuddered ? 13</p>
<p>The delegates followed his advice, for they too felt groundswells
emanating from the sidewalks of Paris. But instead of meeting a measured
loyalty with substantial concessions to the Third Estate, Louis outraged
radicals and liberals alike by dismissing Necker a second time (July
11), replacing him with the Queen’s uncompromising friend Baron de
Breteuil, and (July 12) making the warrior de Broglie minister for war.
The chips were down.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE BASTILLE</li>
</ol>
<p>On July 12 Camille Desmoulins, a Jesuit graduate, leaped upon a table
outside the Cafe de Foy near the Palais-Royal, and denounced the
dismissal of</p>
<p>i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Necker and the summons of alien troops. “The Germans will enter Paris
to - night to butcher the inhabitan ts,” he cried, and called upon his
hearers to arm themselves. They did, for the new municipal council made
little resistance when they broke in and commandeered the weapons housed
in the Hotel de Ville. The armed rebels now paraded the streets,
upholding busts of Necker and the Due d’Orleans, and pluming their hats
with cockades of green; when it became known that this was also the
color of the uniforms worn by the servants and guard of the hate d Comte
d’Artois (younger brother of the King), the green cockade was displaced
by one of red, white, and blue — the national colors.</p>
<p>Fearing indiscriminate violence, destruction of property, and
financial panic, the bankers closed the Bourse, and the middle classes
formed their own militia, which became the nucleus of the Garde
Nationale under Lafay- ette. Nevertheless some agents of the
bourgeoisie, to protect the now se- curely middle-class Assembly,
contributed to finance the popular resistance to an absolute monarchy,
and the winning of the Garde Frangaise from royal to democratic
sentiments. 14 On July 13 the crowd re-formed; enlarged by recruits from
the underworld and the slums, it invaded the Hotel des Invalides
(Veterans’ Hospital), and seized 28,000 muskets and some cannon.
Besenval, doubting that his troops would fire upon the people, kept them
idle in the suburbs. The armed populace now controlled the capital.</p>
<p>What should it do with its power? Many suggested an attempt upon the
Bastille. That old fortress, on the east side of Paris, had been built,
year by year since 1370, to incarcerate important victims of royal or
noble ire, usually committed by lettres de cachet — secret orders of the
king. Under Louis XVI very few prisoners were held there; only seven now
remained; Louis himself had rarely issued a lettre de cachet, and in
1784 he had asked an architect to submit plans for the demolition of the
gloomy bastion. 16 But the people did not know this; they thought of it
as a dungeon holding the victims of a brutal despotism.</p>
<p>Yet the rebels had apparently no intention of destroying it when,
after a night’s rest, they converged upon it on that July 14 which was
to become the national holiday of France. Their aim was to ask the
governor of the prison to let them enter and appropriate the gunpowder
and firearms re- portedly accumulated behind those walls. They had till
now found a little gunpowder, but without more their many muskets and
few cannon would give them no protection if Besenval should bring in his
troops against them. However, those walls — thirty feet thick, one
hundred feet high, protected</p>
<p>He was Bernard-Rene Jordan, Marquis de Launay, a man, we are as-
sured, of genteel education and amiable character. 16 He received the
depu- tation courteously. They proposed to guarantee the pacific
behavior of the</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>rebels if he would remove the cannon from their firing stations and
order his 1 14 soldiers to hold their fire. He agreed, and entertained
his visitors for lunch. Another committee received a similar pledge, but
the besiegers cried out that they wanted ammunition, not words.</p>
<p>While the two sides parleyed, some clever workmen climbed to the con-
trols and lowered two drawbridges. The eager attackers rushed over these
into the courtyard; de Launay ordered them to return; they refused; his
soldiers fired upon them. The invaders were getting the worst of it when
the Garde Franchise brought up five cannon and began to demolish the
walls. Under this cover the crowd poured into the prison, and fought a
hand-to-hand battle with the soldiers; ninety-eight of the attackers
were killed, and one of the defenders, but the crowd increased in number
and fury. De Launay offered to surrender if his men were allowed to
march out safely with their arms. The crowd leaders refused. He yielded.
The victors killed six more soldiers, freed the seven prisoners, seized
ammunition and weapons, took de Launay captive, and marched in triumph
to the Hotel de Ville. On the way some of the crowd, infuriated by the
casualties it had suffered, beat the bewildered aristocrat to death, cut
off his head, and raised it on a pike. Jacques de Flesselles, a merchant
provost who had misled the electors as to the whereabouts of arms, was
cut down on the Place de Greve, and his severed head was added to the
parade.</p>
<p>On July 15 the electors of the section assemblies made Bailly mayor
of Paris, and chose Lafayette to head a new National Guard, and the
happy sansculottes began to demolish the Bastille stone by stone. The
King, shocked and frightened, went to the Assembly and announced that he
had dismissed the troops that had invested Versailles and Paris. On July
16 a conference of nobles advised him to leave under the protection of
the de- parting regiments, and to seek asylum in some provincial capital
or foreign court. Marie Antoinette warmly supported this proposal, and
collected her jewels and other portable treasures for the journey. 17
Instead, on the seven- teenth, Louis recalled Necker, to the delight of
both the financial commu- nity and the populace. On the eighteenth the
King traveled to Paris, visited the Hotel de Ville, and signified his
acceptance of the new council and regime by affixing to his hat the
red-white-and-blue cockade of the Revolu- tion. Returning to Versailles,
he embraced his wife, his sister, and his chil- dr en, and told them,
“Happily no [more] blood has been shed, and I swear that never shall a
drop of French blood be spilled by my order.” 18 His younger brother the
Comte d’ Artois, taking his wife and mistress with him, 19 led the first

<p>army at Versailles, and it saved the new government of Paris from
domina- tion by the environing troops. Quite unintentionally it
preserved the bourgeois Revolution; but it gave the people of the
capital arms and ammu- nition, permitting further developments of
proletarian power.</p>
<p>It gave fresh courage and more readers to the journals that further
excited the Parisians. The Gazette de France , the Mercure de France,
and the Jour- nal de Paris were old established newspapers, and kept an
even keel; now appeared Loustalot’s Les Revolutions de Paris (July 17,
1789), Brissot’s Le Patriote frangais (July 28), Marat’s L’Ami du peuple
(September 12), Des - moulins’ Revolutions de France (November 28)… Add
to these a dozen pamphlets born each day, rioting in the freedom of the
press, raising new idols, shattering old reputations. We can imagine
their contents by noting the descent of the word libel from their name
libelles — little books.</p>
<p>Jean-Paul Marat was the most radical, reckless, ruthless, and
powerful of the new scribes. Born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, May 24,
1743, of a Swiss mother and a Sardinian father, he never ceased to
worship another native expatriate — Rousseau. He studied medicine in
Bordeaux and Paris, and prac- ticed it with moderate success in London
(1765-77). The stories that were later told of the crimes and
absurdities he committed there were probably concoctions by his enemies
in the journalistic license of the times/ 0 He re- ceived an honorary
degree from the University of St. Andrews — which, however, as Johnson
put it, was “growing richer by degrees.” 21 Marat wrote</p>
<p>He was a man of intense pride, hampered by a succession of ailments
that made him irritable to the point of violent passion. His skin
erupted with an unmanageable dermatitis, from which he found temporary
relief by sitting and writing in a warm bath. 22 His head was too
massive for his five feet of height, and one eye was higher than the
other; understandably he courted solitude. Doctors bled him frequently
to ease his pains; in quieter intervals he bled others. He worked with
the intensity of a consuming ambition. “I allot only two of the
twenty-four hours to sleep…. I have not had fifteen minutes’ play in
over three years.” 23 In 1793, perhaps from too much in - door life, his
lungs became affected, and he felt, unknown to Charlotte Corday, that he
had not long to live.</p>
<p>His character suffered from his ailments. His compensatory vanity,
his fits of temper, his delusions of grandeur, his furious denunciations
of Necker, Lafayette, and Lavoisier, his mad calls for mob violence,
overlaid a fund of</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>courage, industry, and dedication. The success of his journal was due
not merely to the exciting exaggerations of his style but still more to
his fervent, unremitting, unbribable support of the voteless
proletaires.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he did not overrate the intelligence of the people. He
saw chaos rising, and added to it; but, at least for the time being, he
counseled not democracy but a dictatorship subject to recall, revolt, or
assassination, as in Rome’s republican days. He suggested that he
himself would make a good dictator. 24 At times he thought that the
government should be managed by men of property, as having the largest
stake in the public weal. 25 He viewed the concentration of wealth as
natural, but he proposed to offset it by preaching the immorality of
luxury and the divine right of hunger and need. “Nothing superfluous can
belong to us legitimately as long as others lack necessities…. Most
ecclesiastical wealth should be distributed among the poor, and free
public schools should be established everywhere.” 26 “Society owes to
those among its members who have no property, and whose labor scarcely
suffices for their support, an assured subsistence, the wherewithal to
feed, lodge, and clothe themselves suitably, provision for attendance in
sick- ness and old age, and for bringing up children. Those who wallow
in wealth must supply the wan ts of those who lack the necessaries of
life”; otherwise the poor nave the right to take by force whatever they
need. 27</p>
<p>Most members of the successive assemblies distrusted and feared
Marat, but the sansculottes among whom he lived forgave his faults for
his philoso- phy, and risked themselves to hide him when he was sought
by the police. He must have had some lovable qualities, for his
common-law wife stayed with him devotedly to his end.</p>

<li>RENUNCIATION: AUGUST 4-5, 1789</li>
</ol>
<p>“This country,” wrot e Gouverneur Morris from France on July 31,
1789, “is at present as near to anarchy as society can approach without
dissolu - tion.” 28 Merchants controlling the market turned shortages of
grain to their profit by raising the price; barges carrying food to the
towns were attacked and pillaged en route; disorder and insecurity
disrupted transportation. Paris was running riot with criminals. The
countryside was so subject to maraud- ing robbers that in several
provinces the peasants armed themselves in their “Great Fear” of these
lawless hordes; in six months 400,000 guns were ac - quired by the
alarmed citizens. When the Great Fear subsided, the peasants decided to
use their weapons against tax collectors, monopolists, and feudal lords.
Armed with muskets, pitchforks, and scythes, they attacked the chateaux,
demanded to be shown the charters or title deeds that allegedly
sanctioned the seignorial rights and dues; if shown them, they burned
them; if resisted, they burned the chateau; in several instances the
owner was killed on the spot. This procedure, beginning in July, 1789,
spread till it reached</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXevery part of France. In some places the insurgents carried
placards claiming that the King had delegated to them full powers in
their districts. 29 Often the destruction was indiscriminate in its
fury; so the peasants on the lands of the Abbey of Murbach burned its
library, carried off its plate and linen, uncorked its wine casks, drank
what they could, and let the remainder flow down the drain. In eight
communes the inhabitants invaded the monasteries, carried off the title
deeds, and explained to the monks that the clergy were now subject to
the pe ople. “In Franche - Comte,” said a report to the Na - tional
Assembly, “nearly forty chateaux and seignorial mansions have been
pillaged or burned; in Langres three out of five; in the Dauphine
twenty- seven; in the Viennois district all the monasteries;… countless
assassina- tions of lords or rich bourgeois.” 30 Town officials who
tried to stop these “Jacqueries” were deposed; some were beheaded.
Aristocrats abandoned their homes and sought safety elsewhere, but
almost everywhere they en- countered the same “spontaneous anarchy.” A
second wave of emigration began.</p>
<p>On the night of August 4, 1789, a deputy reported to the Assembly at
Versailles: “Letters from all the provinces indicate that property of
all kinds is a prey to the most criminal violence; on all sides chateaux
are being burned, convents destroyed, and farms abandoned to pillage.
The taxes, the feudal dues are extinct, the laws are without force, and
the magistrates with- out authority.” 31 The remaining nobles perceived
t hat the revolution, which they had hoped to confine to Paris and to
quiet with minor concessions, was now national, and that feudal dues
could no longer be maintained. The Vi- comte de Noailles proposed that
“all feudal dues shall be redeemable… fo r a money payment or commuted
at a fair valuation…. Seignorial corvees, serfdom, and other forms of
personal servitude shall be abolished without compensation”; and, ending
class exemptions, “taxes shall be paid by every individual in the
kingdom in proportion to his income.”</p>
<p>Noailles was poor, and would suffer quite tolerably by these
measures, but the Due d’Aiguillon, among the richest of the barons,
seconded the pro - posal, and made a startling admission: “The people
are at last trying to ca st off a yoke which has weighed upon them for
many centuries past; and we must confess that — though this insurrection
must be condemned… an ex- cuse can be found for it in the vexations of
which the people have been the victims.” 32 This avowal move d the
liberal nobles to entlxusiastic support; they crowded one another in
coming forward to relinquish their questioned privileges; and after
hours of enthusiastic surrender, at two o’clock on the morning of August
5, the Assembly proclaimed the emancipation of the peasantry. Some
cautious clauses were later added, requiring the peasants to pay, in
periodic installments, a fee in redemption of certain dues; but resis -
tance to these payments made their collection impracticable, and
effected the real end of the feudal system. The signature of the King to
the “great</p>

<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>2 3</p>
<p>other historic document — a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of
the Citizen (August 27, 1789). It was proposed by Lafayette, who was
still warm with the impressions left upon him by the Declaration of
Indepen- dence and the bills of rights proclaimed by several of the
American states. The younger nobles in the Assembly could support the
notion of equality because they had suffered from the hereditary
privileges of the oldest son, and some, like Mirabeau, had borne
arbitrary imprisonment. The bourgeois delegates resented aristocratic
exclusiveness in society, and the noble mo- nopoly of the higher posts
in civil or military service. Almost all the dele- gates had read
Rousseau on the general will, and accepted the doctrine of the
philosopher that basic rights belonged to every human being by natu- ral
law. So there was little resistance to prefacing the new constitution
with a declaration that seemed to complete the revolution. Some articles
can bear repetition:</p>
<p>Article 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights….</p>
<p>Article 2. The aim of all political association is the natural and
imprescripti - ble rights of man. These rights are liberty, property,
security, and resistance to oppression….</p>
<p>Article 4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which
injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each
man has no limits ex- cept those which assure to the other members of
society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can be determined
only by law….</p>
<p>Article 6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizeji
has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in
its formation…. All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are
equally eligible to all digni - ties and to all public positions and
occupations, according to their abilities….</p>
<p>Article 7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except
in the cases, and according to the forms, prescribed by law….</p>
<p>Article 9. As all persons are held innocent until they have been
declared guilty, if arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all harshness
not essential to the securing of the pr isoner’s person shall be
severely repressed by law.</p>
<p>Article 10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions,
including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not
disturb the public order established by law.</p>
<p>Article 11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of
the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly,
speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such
abuses of this free- dom as shall be defined by law….</p>
<p>Article 17. Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one
shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally
determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on condition that the
owner shall have been previously and equitably indemnified. 34</p>
<p>Even in this affirmation of democratic ideals some imperfections
remained. Slavery was allowed to continue in the French Caribbean
colonies until the Convention abolished it in 1794. The new constitution
restricted the ballot, and eligibility to public office, to payers of a
specified minimum of taxes. Civil rights were still withheld from
actors, Protestants, and Jews. Louis XVI withheld his agreement to the
declaration on the ground that it</p>
<p>24 THEAGEOFNAPOLEON (CHAP. II</p>
<p>would stir up further unrest and disorder. It remained for the
Parisian popu- lace to force his consent.</p>
<p>V. TO VERSAILLES: OCTOBER 5, 1 789</p>
<p>All through August and September there were riots in Paris. Bread was
running short again; housewives fought for it at the bakeries. In one of
these riots a baker and a municipal officer were slain by the angry
populace. Marat called for a march upon the Assembly and the royal
palace at Versailles:</p>
<p>When public safety is in peril the people must take power out of the
hands of those to whom it is entrusted…. Put that Austrian woman [the
Queen] and her brother-in-law [Artois] in prison…. Seize the ministers
and their clerks and put them in irons…. Make sure of the mayor [poor,
amiable, star- gazing Bailly] and his lieutenants; keep the general
[Lafayette] in sight, and arrest his staff…. The heir to the throne has
no right to a dinner while you want bread. Organize bodies of armed men.
March to the National Assembly and demand food at once…. Demand that the
nation’s poor have a future secured to them out of the national
contribution. If you are refused join the army, take the land, as well
as the gold, which the rascals who want to force you to come to terms by
hunger have buried, and share it among you. Off with the heads of the
ministers and their underlings. Now is the time ! 35 Frightened by the
journals and disorder in Paris, and by mass demonstra- tions in
Versailles, Louis reverted to the advice of his ministers — that
soldiers yet untouched by revolutionary ideas should be brought in to
protect him, his family, and the court. Late in September he sent to
Douai for the Flan- ders Regiment. It came, and on October 1 the King’s
Garde du Corps wel- comed it with a banquet in the opera house of the
palace. When Louis and Marie Antoinette appeared, the troops, half drunk
with wine and visible majesty, burst into wild applause. Soon they
replaced the national tricolor emblems on their uniforms with cockades
of the Queen’s colors— white and black; one report said that the
discarded colors, now dear to the Revolution, were later trodden under
dancing feet. 36 (Mme. Campan, first lady of the chamber to the Queen,
and an eyewitness, denied this detail. 37 )</p>
<p>The story was enlarged as it traveled to Paris, and was accentuated
by a report that an army was gathering near Metz with intent to march to
Ver- sailles and disperse the Assembly. Mirabeau and other deputies
denounced this new military threat. Marat, Loustalot, and other
journalists demanded that the people should compel both the royal family
and the Assembly to move to Paris, where they could be under the
watchful eye of the populace. On October 5 the market women of the city,
who knew the food shortage at first hand, took the lead in forming a
brigade to march on Versailles, ten miles away. As they proceeded they
called upon men and women to join them; thousands did. It was not a
tragic or somber procession; a lusty French humor seasoned it; “We will
bring back the baker and the baker’s wife,” they cried, “and we shall
have the pleasure of hearing Mirabeau.” 38</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Arrived at Versailles under a heavy rain, they gathered in haphazard
array, eight thousand strong, before the high gates and iron paling of
the royal palace, and demanded access to the King. A delegation went to
the Assembly and insisted that the deputies should find bread for the
crowd. Mounier, then presiding, went with one of the delegation, pretty
Louison Chabry, to see Louis. She was so choked with emotion on seeing
him that she could only cry, and fell in a swoon. When she recovered
Louis</p>
<p>promised her to find bread for the wet and hungry multitude. On
departing, she sought to kiss his hand, but he embraced her like a
father. Meanwhile many attractive Parisiennes mingled with Flemish
troops, and convinced them that gentlemen do not fire upon unarmed
women; several soldiers took the famished sirens into their barracks and
gave them food and warmth. At eleven o’clock that night Lafayette
arrived with fifteen thousand of the National Guard. He was received by
the King, and pledged him protection, but he joined Necker in advising
him to accept the people’s demand that he and the Queen should come to
live in Paris. Then, exhausted, he retired to the Hotel de Noailles.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of October 6 the weary, angry crowd poured</p>
<p>hrough a chance opening of the gate into the courtyard of the palace,
and some armed men forced their way up the stairs to the apartment where
the Queen was asleep. In her petticoat, and with the Dauphin in her
arms, she fled to the King’s room. Palace guards r esisted the invasion,
and three of them were killed. Lafayette, tardy but helpful, quieted the
tumult with assurances of accord. The King went out on the balcony, and
promised to move to Paris. The crowd cried, “Vive le Roi!” but demanded
that the Queen show herself. She did, and stood her ground when a man in
the gathering aimed his musket at her; his weapon was beaten down by
those near him. Lafayette joined Marie Antoinette and kissed her hand in
sign of loyalty; the softened rebels vowed to love the Queen if she
would come and live in the capital.</p>
<p>As noon approached, a procession formed without precedent in history:
in front the National Guard and the royal Garde du Corps; then a coach
bearing the King, his sister Madame Elisabeth, the Queen, and her two
chil- dren; then a long line of carts carrying sacks of flour; then the
triumphant Parisians, some women perched on cannon, some men holding
aloft on spikes the heads of slain palace guards; at Sevres they stopped
to have these heads powdered and curled. 39 The Queen doubted she would
reach Paris alive, but that night she and the rest of the royal family
slept in hastily pre- pared beds in the Tuileries, where French kings
had slept before the Fronde rebellion had made the capital hateful to
Louis XIV. A few days later the Assembly followed, and was housed in the
theater of the same palace.</p>
<p>Once again the populace of Paris had taken charge of the Revolution
by forcing the King’s hand. Now, subject to his subjects, he accepted
the Declaration of the Rights of Man as a fait accompli. A third wave of
emi- gration began.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE REVOLUTIONARY CONSTITUTION: 1790</li>
</ol>
<p>Freed from royal resistance, but uncomfortably aware of the
surveillant city, the Assembly proceeded to write the constitution that
would specify and legalize the achievements of the Revolution.</p>
<p>First, should it retain the kingship? It did, and allowed it to be
hereditary, for it feared that until the sentiments of legitimacy and
loyalty could be transferred from the monarch to the nation, the
mesmerizing aura of royalty would be necessary to social order; and the
right of transmission would be a guard against wars of succession and
such schemes as were then brewing in the Palais-Royal. But the powers of
the king were to be strictly limited. The Assembly would vote him
annually a “civil list” for his expenses; any further outlay would
require application to the legislature. If he left the kingdom without
the Assembly’ s permission he could be deposed, as he would shortly see.
He could choose and dismiss his ministers, but each minis- ter would be
required to submit a monthly statement of his disposal of the funds
allotted to him, and he could at any time be arraigned before a high
court. The king was to command the Army and the Navy, but he could not
declare war, or sign a treaty, without the legislature’s prior consent.
He should have the right to veto any legislation submitted to him; but
if three successive legislatures passed the vetoed bill it was to become
law.</p>
<p>Should the legislature, so supreme, have two chambers, as in England
and America? An upper chamber could be a check to hasty action, but it
could also become a bastion of aristocracy or old age. The Assembly
rejected it, and, as a further guard, declared an end to all hereditary
privileges and titles except the king’s. The legislature was to be
elected by “active citizens” only — male adult property holders paying
in direct taxes an amount equal to the value of three days’ work; this
included prosperous peasants but excluded hired labor, actors, and
proletaires; these were classed as “passive citizens,” for they could
easily be manipulated by their masters or their journalists to become
tools of reaction or violence. On this arrangement 4,298,360 men (in a
population of 25 million souls) enjoyed the franchise in the France of
1791; 3 million adult males were voteless. The bourgeois Assembly,
fearful of the city populace, was certifying the bourgeois
Revolution.</p>
<p>For electoral and administrative purposes the constitution divided
France into eighty-three departements, each of these into communes
(43,360). For the first time France was to become a unified nation,
without privileged provinces or internal tolls, and all with one system
of measurements and laws. Penalties were fixed by law, and were no
longer at the discretion of a judge. Torture, the pillory, and branding
were abolished, but the death pen- alty was retained, to Robespierre’s
present discontent and future con - venience. Persons accused of crime
could choose to be tried by a jury of “active citizens” chosen by lot; a
minority of three votes out of twelve</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>2 7</p>
<p>parlements, which had begotten a second aristocracy, were replaced by
a new judiciary appointed by the electoral assemblies. A high court was
chosen by lot from lower-court justices, two to a departement.</p>
<p>Two immense and related problems remained: how to avoid bankruptcy,
and how to regulate the relations between Church and state. Taxes were
failing to finance the government, and the Church held enviable wealth
un- taxed. It took the recently appointed bishop of Autun,
Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, to propose (October n, 1789) the
solution: let the property of the Church be used for the payment of the
national debt.</p>
<p>Talleyrand is one of the doubly intriguing characters in history. He
came of an old family distinguished for its military services, and he
would prob- ably have followed a similar career had he not permanently
dislocated his foot by a fall at the age of four; he had to limp his way
through life, but managed to surmount every obstacle. His parents
resigned him to the Church. In the seminary he read Voltaire and
Montesquieu, and maintained a mistress nearby. Apparently he was
expelled (1775), but in that year (his twenty-first) he received from
Louis XVI the Abbey of St.-Denis in Reims. He was ordained a priest in
1779, and on the next day became vicar general to his uncle the
Archbishop of Reims. He continued to please highborn ladies; by one of
them he had a son, who became an officer under Napoleon. In 1788
Talleyrand was appointed bishop of Autun over the protests of his pious
mother, who knew that he was a man of litde faith. Nevertheless he drew
up for presentation to the States-General a program of reforms which so
impressed his clergy that they made him their deputy. 40</p>
<p>Despite desperate opposition by its clerical members, the Assembly
(No- vember 2, 1789) voted, 508 to 346, to nationalize ecclesiastical
property, then valued at three billion francs. 41 It pledged the
government to “provide in a fitting manner for the expenses of public
worship, the maintenance of the ministers, and the relief of the poor.”
On December 19 it empowered a Caisse de l’Extraordinaire to sell 400
million francs’ worth of “assignats”— notes assigning to the holder a
right to a stated amount of ecclesiastical prop- erty, and bearing
interest at five percent until a sale could be effected. With proceeds
from these assignats the government paid off its more urgent debts, so
assuring the support of the financial community for the new regime. But
the buyers of the assignats found it difficult to make satisfactory
purchases; they used them as currency; and as the state issued more and
more of them, and inflation continued, they lost value except in the
payment of taxes, where the Treasury was compelled to receive them at
their face worth. So the Treasury again found itself with losses
exceeding its income year after year.</p>
<p>Having crossed the Rubicon, the Assembly (February 13, 1790) sup-</p>
<p>pressed monasteries, allowing pensions to the dispossessed monks; 42
nuns were left untouched, as performing valued services in education and
charity. On July 12 a “Civil Constitution of the Clergy” was
promulgated, regulat - ing the priests as paid employees of the state,
and recognizing Catholicism as the national religion. Protestants and
Jews might worship freely in their</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>E rivate conventicles, but without support from the government.
Catholic ishops were to be chosen by the electoral assemblies of the
departments; and in this voting non-Catholic electors — Protestant, Jew,
or agnostic — were free to participate. 43 All priests, before receiving
any stipend from the state, were required to pledge full obedience to
the new constitution. Of the 1 34 bishops in France, 130 refused to take
this oath; of the 70,000 parish priests, 46,000 refused. 44 The great
majority of the population sided with the non- jurors, and boycotted the
services of the jurant priests. The rising conflict between the
conservative Church, supported by the people, and the pre- dominantly
agnostic assemblies, supported by the upper middle class, be- came a
main factor in the waning of the Revolution. Chiefly because of this
unpopular legislation the King long refused to sign the new
constitution. Others had reasons for rejecting it. Robespierre led a
strong minority in protesting that the restriction of the franchise to
property owners violated the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and was a
provocative insult to the Parisian proletaires who had repeatedly saved
the Assembly from the armies of the King. The peasantry agreed with
townspeople in resenting the aban- donment of the governmental
regulations that had in some measure pro- tected producers and consumers
from a “free market” manipulated by dis - tributors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Assembly felt, with some justice, that the
constitution was a remarkable document, giving legal and definitive form
to the trium- phant Revolution. The middle-class deputies, now supreme,
considered that the commonalty — of whom the majority were still
illiterate — was not ready to share, in proportion to its numbers, in
the deliberations and decisions of the government. Besides, now that the
nobility had fled, was it not the turn of the bourgeoisie to direct a
state increasingly dependent upon a wisely man- aged and energetically
advancing economy? So the Assembly, regardless of the King’s
hesitations, declared France a constitutional monarchy; and, on June 5,
1790, it invited the eighty-three departments to send their federated
National Guards to join the people of Paris and the government of France
on the Champ-de-Mars in celebrating — on the first anniversary of the
taking of the Bastille — the fulfillment of the Revolution. As the
invitation and the enthusiasm spread, thirty foreigners, led by a rich
Dutchman known to his- tory as “Anacharsis Cloots,”* entered the
Assembly on June 19, and asked for the honor of French citizenship, and
for admission to the Feast of the Federation as an “embassy of the human
race.” It was so ordered.</p>
<p>But the hilly Field of Mars had to be sculptured for the occasion: an
area three thousand by one thousand feet had to be leveled and terraced
to hold 300,000 men, women, and children; and a central mound was to be
raised for an altar at which King, princes, prelates, deputies, and
commoners would mount and pledge their loyalty to the nation now legally
reborn. And yet only fifteen days were left for the sculpturing. Who now

ecstasy — especially if nearly half our manuscript had been burned by a
hasty maid, and we had to gather and polish our scattered gems again?
What a fire must have smol- dered in that dour Scot to survive such a
holocaust!</p>
<p>So, in the week before the new holyday, soldiers from all of
France</p>
<p>raveled to Paris, and sometimes the Parisian National Guard marched
out many miles to meet and escort them. On July 14, 1790, they all
entered the Field of Mars in proud procession, fifty thousand strong, 46
their banners waving, their bands playing, their throats hoarse with
their lusty songs, and 300,000 exalted Parisians joining in. Bishop
Talleyrand-Perigord, not yet ex- communicate, said Mass; two hundred
prelates and priests mounted the altar and took the oath; the King
pledged himself to obey the new laws to the best of his ability, and all
the assemblage cried out, “ Vive le Roi!” When the cannon sounded a
salute, thousands of Parisians who had not been able to attend raised a
hand toward the Champ-de-Mars, and made their pledge. In nearly every
town similar festivities were held, with wine and food shared in common,
and Catholic and Protestant pastors embracing as if they were
Christians. How could any Frenchman doubt that a glorious new age had
dawned?</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">

</ol>
<p>One man, at least, could doubt, and one woman. To Louis and his Queen
the Tuileries seemed a glass house in which their every move was subject
to silent approval or prolonged condemnation by the populace. On August
31, 1790, a Swiss regiment in the King’s service at Nancy mutinied over
delayed pay and official tyranny. Some of the rebels were shot down by
the National Guard; some were sent to the galleys; some were hanged.
Hearing of this, a crowd of forty thousand Parisians converged
threateningly upon the royal palace, denouncing Lafayette, blaming the
King for the “Nancy massacre,” and demanding the resignation of his
ministers. Necker quietly departed (September 18, 1790) to live with his
family at Coppet on Lake Geneva. Lafayette advised the King to pacify
Paris by accepting the constitu-</p>
<p>ion. 47 The Queen, however, suspected the general of planning to
replace her as the power behind the throne, and so clearly expressed her
antipa- thy that he left the court and resigned to Mirabeau the task of
salvaging the monarchy. 48</p>
<p>Mirabeau was willing. He had need of money to support his lavish way
of life; he felt that a coalition of King and Assembly was the only
alternative to rule by leaders of the mob; and he saw no contradiction
in pursuing this</p>

<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>policy and replenishing his funds. As far back as September 28, 1789,
he had written to his friend La Marck*: “All is lost. The King and Que
en will be swept away, and you will see the populace triumphing over
their helpless bodies.” 49 And to the same friend, on October 7: “If you
have any influence with the King or the Queen, persuade them that they
and France are lost if the royal family does not leave Paris. I am busy
with a plan for getting them away.” 50 Louis rejected the plan, but he
consented to finance Mira - beau’s defense of the monarchy. Early in
May, 1790, he agreed to pay the great adventurer’s debts, to a llow him
,000 a month, and to reward him with 92,000 if he succeeded in
reconciling the Assembly with the King. 51 In August the Queen gave him
a private interview in her gardens at St.- Cloud. So great was the aura
of majesty that the dragon of rebellion trem- bled with devotion when he
kissed her hand. To his intimates he spoke of her ecstatically: “You
know not the Queen. Her force of mind is prodigious. She is a man for
courage.” 52</p>
<p>He considered himself “paid but not bought”; according to La Marck
“he accepted payment for keeping his own opinions.” 53 He had no
intention of defending absolutism; on the contrary, the statement which
he submitted to the King’s ministers on December 23, 1790, was a program
for reconciling public liberty wit h the royal authority: “To attack the
Revolution would be to overshoot the mark, for the movement that makes a
great people give it- self better laws deserves support…. Both the
spirit of the Revolution and many elements in its constitution must be
accepted…. I regard all the ef- fects of the Revolution… as conquests so
irrevocable that no upheaval, short of dismembering the realm, could
destroy them.” 54</p>
<p>He labored with devotion and bribes to save the remnants of royal au-
thority. The Assembly suspected his venality but respected his genius.
On January 4, 1791, it chose him its president for the usual term of two
weeks. He astonished all by the order of his management and the
impartiality of his decisions. He worked all day, ate and drank all
evening, and wore himself out with women. On March 2 5 he entertained
two dancers from the Opera. The next morning he was seized with violent
intestinal cramps. He attended the Assembly on the twenty-seventh, but
returned to his rooms exhausted and trembling. The news of his illness
spread through Paris; theaters were closed out of respect for him; his
house was besieged by people asking about his condition; one youth came
offering his blood for transfusion. 65 Talley- rand told him: “It is not
easy to reach you; half of Paris is permanently out - side your door.”
56 Mirabeau died after much suffering, April 2, 1791.</p>
<p>On April 3 a delegation from the electors of Paris asked the Assembly
to convert the Church of St.-Genevieve into a shrine and tomb for French
heroes, and that this Pantheon (“of all the gods”), as it was soon to be
called, should bear on its front the inscription “Aux grands hommes la
Patrie</p>

<p>extensive and popular funeral procession that had ever been in the
world”; 67 the historian estimated the crowd at between three and four
hundred thou- sand — in the streets and the trees, at windows or on
roofs; all of the Assembly except Petion (who had secret evidence of
Mirabeau’s receiving money from the King); all the Jacobin Club; twenty
thousand National Guards; “One would nave thought they were transferring
the ashes of Voltaire— of one of those men who never die.” 68 On A ugust
io, 1792, proofs were found among the fallen King’s papers of payments
to Mirabeau, and on Septem - ber 22, 1794, the Convention ordered the
tarnished hero’s remains removed from the Pantheon.</p>

<li>TO VARENNES: JUNE 20 , 1791</li>
</ol>
<p>The King, reluctant to surrender the nobility, the clergy, and the
mon- archy to total denudation of their ancient authority, and convinced
that a people so individualistic and impetuous as the French would obey
no rule, permit no restraints, not sanctioned and ingrained by time,
clung hopefully to the vestigial powers still left him, and resisted the
daily urging of nobles and the Queen that he should escape from Paris,
perhaps from France, and return with an army, native or foreign, strong
enough to reestablish him upon a reinvigorated throne. He signed
(January 21, 1791) the Gvil Con- stitution of the Clergy, but he felt
that he was betraying the faith that had been his precious refuge
against the disappointments of his life. He was pro- foundly shocked by
the Assembly’s decision (May 30, 1791) to have the remains of Voltaire
transferred to the Pantheon; it seemed intolerable to him that the
arch-infidel of the century should be carried in triumph to lie with
honors in what, only yesterday, had been a consecrated church. He gave
his long-withheld consent to the Queen to prepare for a flight across
the fron- tier. Her devoted friend, Count Axel von Fersen, raised money
for the es- cape, and arranged the details; the King, certainly a
gentleman, probably not a cuckold, thanked him fervently. 59</p>
<p>All the world knows that story: how the King and Queen disguised as
M. and Mme. Korff, with their children and attendants, left the
Tuileries furtively at midnight of June 20-2 1, 1791, and rode all next
day, in joy and fear, 150 miles, to Varennes, near the frontier of what
is now Belgium (then the Austrian Netherlands); how they were stopped
there and arrested by peasants armed with pitchforks and clubs and led
by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, postmaster of Ste.-Menehould. He sent to the
Assembly for instructions; soon Barnave and Petion came with the answer:
Bring your captives, unharmed, back to Paris. Now it was a three days’
drive, leisurely led by sixty thousand of the National Guard. On the way
Barnave sat in the royal coach opposite the Queen; he had been trained
in the surviving chivalry of the Old Regime; he felt the glamour of
royal beauty in distress. He wondered what would be her fate, and that
of the children she guarded. By the time they reached Paris he was her
slave.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Through his efforts and other cautious considerations, the Assembly
re- jected the cry of the sansculottes for immediate deposition. Who
could tell what anarchy would ensue? Would the bourgeois Assembly, and
all prop- erty, be at the mercy of the unfranchised Parisian populace?
So the word went out that the King had not fled but had been abducted;
he must be allowed to keep his head, at least for a while, and as much
of his crown as the new laws had left him. The radical leaders
protested; the clubs and the journals called for the people to assemble
on the Field of Mars; on July 17, 1791, fifty thousand came, and six
thousand signed a demand for the Fling’s , abdication. 60 The Assembly
ordered Lafayette and the National Guard to disperse the rebels; these
refused, and some of them stoned the Guard; the</p>
<p>S soldiers fired, killing fifty men and women; so ended the universal
;rhood that had been pledged there a year before. Marat, proscribed and
hunted by the police, lived in dank cellars, and called for a new
revolu- tion. Lafayette, his popularity ended, returned to the front,
and waited im- patiently for a chance to escape from the mounting chaos
of France.</p>
<p>The King, grateful for a reprieve, went in subdued state to the
Assembly on September 13, 1791, and formally signed his assent to the
new constitu- tion. Returning to his desolate palace and Queen, he broke
down and wept, and begged her to forgive him for having brought her from
her happiness in Vienna to the shame of this defeat, and the mounting
terror of this im- prisonment.</p>
<p>As that month neared its end, the Assembly prepared to conclude its
labors. Perhaps the deputies were tired, and felt that they had done
enough for a lifetime. And indeed, from their standpoint, they had
accomplished much. They had presided at the collapse of the feudal
system; they had abolished hereditary privileges; they had rescued the
people from monar- chical absolutism and an idle, arrogant aristocracy;
they had established equality before the law, and had ended imprisonment
without trial. They had reorganized local and provincial administration.
They had chastened the once independent and censorious Church by
confiscating its wealth and declaring freedom of worship and thought;
they had revenged Jean Calas and Voltaire. They had seen with pleasure
the emigration of reactionary nobles, and had put the upper middle class
in control of the state. And they had embodied these changes in a
constitution to which they had won the consent of the King, and of the
great majority of the population, as a prom- ise of national unity and
peace.</p>
<p>The National and Constituent Assembly completed its record by arrang-
ing for the election of a Legislative Assembly to transform the
constitution into specific laws, and to meet with deliberation the
problems of the future. Robespierre, hoping that a fresh poll would
bring a more representative per- sonnel to power, persuaded his fellow
deputies to disbar themselves from election to the new legislature.
Then, on September 30, 1791, “the most memorable of all political
assemblies” 61 declare d itself dissolved.</p>
