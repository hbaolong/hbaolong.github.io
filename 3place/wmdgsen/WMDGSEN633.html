<h4 id="chapter-xxxix-to-the-end">CHAPTER XXXIX To the End</h4>
<p>I. ST. HELENA</p>
<p>I T was a long trip from England — from August 8 to October 15.
Accus- tomed to action and quick speech, Napoleon bore the tedium
hardly. Admiral Sir George Cockburn thought to ease the situation by
daily inviting Napoleon and one or other of his companions to dine with
him and some officers; the British, however, spent two and a half hours
at dinner; Napo- leon easily persuaded them to excuse him when the
drinking began. He winced when they addressed him as “General” instead
of “Emperor,” but he admired their courtesy. His friends suggested that
a good way to anesthetize time would be for him to dictate to them his
memoirs of rule and war. Now began the narratives, taken down by
O’Meara, Las Cases, Gourgaud, or Montholon, which, published by them
after his death, played a part in mak- ing the memory of Napoleon a
living force in France throughout the cen- tury.</p>
<p>Men at sea long so for land that even Napoleon must have been pleased
when he sighted the rocky coast of St. Helena. One glance could take in
most of the island; it was only twenty miles in circumference, and
nearly all its population was gathered in the port city, Jamestown, with
its one street and five thousand souls. A rough, uneven terrain, rising
to a plateau at Long- wood; a tropical climate of heat, mist, and rain;
no regular succession of seasons, but incalculable alternations of wet
and dry; an unfriendly soil slow to reward tillage with food. It was a
“spot of earth” ideal for insulating a troublemaker, but a torture for a
man whose life was action demanding a continent for its stage.</p>
<p>He and his party remained on board while Admiral Cockburn sought
temporary lodging for them till work should be completed on the big
house that the British government had chosen for their collective home.
For Napo- leon, Las Cases, and son the admiral found a pleasant place,
“the Briars,” whose owner, William Balcombe, thought it would be
interesting to have an emperor as his guest. Two daughters, aged sixteen
and fourteen, brightened the scene; they spoke a little French, played
and sang, and became so fond of Napoleon that the younger one wept when
he had to move to “Long - wood.”</p>
<p>This was an old farmhouse, some six miles from Jamestown. Its many
rooms had been simply but adequately furnished. According to the
excellent ground plan drawn by Las Cases, Jr., Napoleon was given six
rooms: a large “antechamber and waiting room for visitors,” a parlor, a
bedroom, a study, a library, and a large dining room. The inner walls
were inelegantly covered with tarred canvas, but there were many
windows. Napoleon accepted his</p>
<p>758</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>TO THE END</p>
<p>759</p>
<p>suite without initial complaint; he even rejoiced in the bathroom,
which he described as “an unheard - of luxury in this unhappy island.” 1
“The Em - peror,” Las Cases reported, “was satisfied with everything.” 2
In another</p>
<p>Napoleon had freedom of movement — on foot, or mounted, or in a car-
riage — within a radius of five miles from the house; but he had to
submit to surveillance by British troops when he went outside the
Longwood pla- teau. Meals for Napoleon and his retinue were sent up
daily from the gover- nor of the island, and, within limits, they could
order their food. 4 Usually the Emperor ate sparingly until eight
o’clock in the evening; then he and his staff dined with a leisureliness
that left him ready for bed. Napoleon had brought a costly silver
service with him from France; it was regularly used; and we hear also of
knives, forks, and spoons of gold. 5 The dishes were mostly of Sevres
porcelain. The servants were in full uniform of green and gold. Las C
ases was impressed by “the elegance of the dinner service, and the
neatness with which the tables were laid out.” 6 The etiquette of the
Tuileries was maintained at Longwood. Napoleon allowed his faithful
friends much candor of speech, but no familiarities; they always
referred to him as “the Emperor,” and addressed him as “your Majesty.”
Letters addressed to him as “General” remained unopened; visitors had to
address him as “Em - peror” or stay away.</p>
<p>There were many irritations, and some hardships. Rats made themselves
at home, even in the Emperor’s hat; they ran around the table legs while
he ate; fleas and bugs made no distinction of human ranks; “we are
absolutely eaten,” Las Cases complained. 7 There were damp mists every
other day. Water sometimes failed, and the Emperor missed his hot bath.
Constant sur- veillance, however distant or polite, usually compelled a
monastic chastity, just when excessive leisure made temptation doubly
acceptable. But where else did a prisoner have so many friends on call,
and servants, and a horse and buggy, and all the books he could use? All
in all, it was as tolerable a prison as a prisoner could expect,
especially after escaping from previous confine- ment and requiring the
expenditure of millions of pounds sterling and flesh to recapture him.
Matters went reasonably well till Sir Hudson Lowe came.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SIR HUDSON LOWE</li>
</ol>
<p>He arrived on April 14, 1816, to replace Sir George Cockburn as
governor of the island. The British government thought its choice was
well con- sidered: Sir Hudson was a conscientious official, who would
carry out in- structions faithfully. His instructions were to extend the
prisoner “every</p>
<p>760 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xindulgence wh ich may be consistent with the entire security of his
person.”</p>
<p>He began well. He brought with him nearly 2,000 French volumes, and
placed them at the disposal of Napoleon and his companions. He sent word
that he had heard of repairs needed at Longwood, and would soon have
them attended to. 8 He thought he should visit his distinguished
prisoner, and asked his predecessor, Admiral Cockburn, to accompany him.
Presumably he did not know that Napoleon, as a precaution against
sightseers and busy- bodies, had instructed Bertrand to allow no one to
visit him except through Bertrand’s permission and escort. Sir Hudson
-and the admiral came un- announced, and sought admission; Napoleon sent
reply that he was ill and could not see them. Lowe inquired when might
he try again; Napoleon an- swered, Tomorrow. Lowe’s pride was hurt. He
came on the morrow, accompanied by Bertrand. Napoleon received him
coldly, and listed some inconveniences from which he suffered: sentinels
were stationed too near his house, and sometimes, at night, peered
through his windows; he could not ride beyond narrow limits without
being followed by an English officer. Lowe promised to do his best.®
After his departure Napoleon remarked to his companions that he had
“never seen a countenance so like that of an Italian cutthroat.” 10</p>
<p>Sir Hudson had more pride than humor. Returning to his office, he
sent word to Napoleon’s aides that the restrictions of which Napoleon
com - plained had been imposed by the British government, and that he
had no authority to remove them. He added, again pursuant to his
government’s instructions, that all communications between Longwood and
the outside world must pass through his hands, and be subject to
inspection by him. 11 According to Las Cases, the governor refused to
transmit letters addressed to “the Emperor Napoleon.” 12 He sent an
invitation to dinner to General Ber - trand and “General Napoleon.”
Napoleon refused it.</p>
<p>The quarrel reached high temperature when Lowe informed Bertrand that
the British government had complained about the high cost it was in-
curring for the upkeep of Napoleon and his household of fifty-one per-
sons. 13 The government had allowed ^8,000 annually for this; the actual
expense for the first year was £ 18,000; the government proposed that
any future expenditure over £ 8,000 should be paid by Napoleon. The
Emperor ordered Montholon to sell the imperial silver, and offered to
pay the surplus expense of his household if Lowe would pass unopened
Napoleon’s letter to his Paris banker; Lowe would not. Napoleon’s family
sent him offers of money; he thanked them, but said he could take care
of the matter. They offered to come and live with him; he forbade them,
saying that they would not long survive the climate and the isolation.
Lowe thought to ease the situation by raising the imperial allowance to
£ 1 2,000 a year. 14 But this dis - cussion of his expenses infuriated
Napoleon. When Lowe visited him again (July 16, 1816), Napoleon,
according to his report to Las Cases, burned all bridges by crying out,
“Will you allow me to tell you what we think of you? We think you
capable of everything; yes, of everything…. I shall have to complain,
not that the worst proceeding of ministers was to send</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>TO THE END</p>
<p>761</p>
<p>me to St. Helena, but that they gave you the command of it. You are a
greater calamity to us than all the wretchedness of this horrible rock.”
15 “The Emperor,” says Las Cases, “admitted that he had, during this
conver - sation, repeatedly offended Sir Hudson Lowe.” “I have been
thrown quite out of temper. They have sent me more than a jailer! Sir
Hudson Lowe is a downright executioner!… My anger must have been
powerfully excited, for I felt a vibration in the calf of my left leg.”
16</p>
<p>Sir Hudson, overwhelmed, withdrew. They had no further converse.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE GREAT COMPANIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>The most striking aspect of this incarcerated life is the constant
and in- tense fidelity of the aides who accompanied Napoleon to
St. Helena. Pre- sumably the intoxicating aura of fame shared in
stimulating their services, but their persistence in them despite the
restraints and homesickness of exile, the quarrels of competition for
the Emperor’s favor, and the irritation of a depressing climate and a
disagreeable governor, lends to their record almost the quality of an
Arthurian legend, darkened with jealousies but ennobled with
devotion.</p>
<p>Noblest of them was Comte Henri-Gratien Bertrand (1773-1844). He
entered history as a military engineer under Napoleon in the first
Italian campaign. In the Egyptian expedition he commanded a battalion at
the battle of the Pyramids, and was wounded in the victory at Abukir.
The bridges that he built across the Danube in the campaign of 1809 were
rated by Na- poleon as the finest such work since the Romans. 17 In 1813
he was made grand marshal of the palace. He remained loyal to Napoleon
through the bitter years of retreat before the Allies, accompanied him
to Elba, stayed with him during the Hundred Days, rode with him to
Rochefort, and sailed with him to England and St. Helena. There he
continued as grand marshal, checking visitors, cooling tempers, keeping
truce between Napoleon and the governor, and bearing with forgiving
patience the attempt to seduce his wife.* She was an English Creole,
niece of Lord Dillon, and related to Josephine. She bore with impatient
fidelity her isolation, in St. Helena, from the social life of Paris.
Bertrand took her back to France five months after Napoleon’s death. He
had compiled three volumes of a diary in St. Helena, but refused to
publish them. They were deciphered and published in 1949-59, a century
after his death. He was buried in the crypt of Les Invalides, beside the
remains of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Almost equal in devotion was the Irish surgeon Barry O’Meara (
1786—</p>
<p>1836). As ship’s doctor o n the Northumberland, he attended
Napoleon,</p>
<ul>
<li>Bertrand’s diary under April 26, 1821: “The Emperor replied
[according to what Mon - tholon told Mme. Bertrand]: *… I resented her
refusal to become my mistress…. I shall never forgive Dr. Antommarchi
for having attended a woman who refused to become my mistress.’ ” 18 But
when Napoleon said this he was within ten days of death, and may have
lost track of his amours. Bertrand noted, on the same date: “He
frequently appeared to have lost his memory.”</li>
</ul>
<p>762</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xalked with him in French or Italian, half agreed with his opinion of
physi- cians, and became so strongly attached to him that he asked — and
received- permission of the British government to remain in attendance
on Napoleon in St. Helena. Sir Hudson Lowe did not approve of such
intimacy between a British doctor and a French criminal; he suspected
O’Meara of a plot to have Napoleon escape; he insisted on assigning a
soldier to accompany the surgeon wherever he went; O’Meara protested;
Lowe had him recalled to Britain (July, 1818). In 1822 O’Meara published
Napoleon in Exile, or A Voice from St. Helena, a passionate plea for a
better treatment of the fallen Emperor. The two volumes had a wide sale,
and started a wave of English sympathy for Napoleon. The book contains
some errors, 19 having been writ- ten from memory; but Las Cases
defended O’Meara’s account, and all those around Napoleon seem to have
had a</p>
<p>and as a gentleman.</p>
<p>The eventful devotion of Comte Emmanuel- Augustin-Dieudonne de Las
Cases (1766-1842), and his voluminous Memorial de Sainte-Helene have
placed him only next to Napoleon and Lowe in the dramatis personae of
the island. He was a minor noble, fought in Conde’s army against the
Revolution, emigrated to England, joined in the attempt of some emigres
to invade France at Quiberon, failed to land, returned to England, and
lived by teaching history. He drew up an Atlas historique which later
won high praise from Napoleon. Soon after the 1 8th Brumaire he ventured
to return to France. He judged Napoleon to be the right medicine for the
Revolution; sought every opportunity to serve him, and rose to be a
member of the Council of State. Waterloo did not cool his admiration for
the Emperor; he went to Malmaison to help him, followed him to
Rochefort, to England, and to St. Helena.</p>
<p>Of all the companions he remained closest to the Emperor, was the
most zealous in recording his dictation, and kept his high estimate of
him through all the storms of the exile’s temper. He noted everything
about Napoleon except the faults; he did not, like Cromwell, believe in
immortalizing warts. His report of Napoleon’s recollections a nd
observations does not claim to be verbally precise. “The Emperor
dictated very rapidly, almost as fast as he speaks in ordinary
conversation. I was therefore obliged to invent a kind of hieroglyphic
writing; and I, in my turn, dictated this to my son”; or “I sat beside
my son as he wrote the Emperor’s dictation…. I always read to the
Emperor what he had dictated the preceding day, and then he made correc-
tions and dictated further.” 20 However, the language in which Las Cases
expressed his own views is so much like that which he ascribes to
Napoleon that we cannot accept his report as revealing Napoleon as
impartially as in the more vividly immediate journal of Gourgaud.</p>
<p>Anxious to arouse Europe to the hardships which Napoleon was
suffering, Las Cases wrote an account of these on a piece of silk,
addressed it to Lucien Bonaparte, and entrusted it to a servant who was
about to return to Europe. The servant was searched; the message was
discovered; Sir Hudson Lowe had Las Cases arrested, confiscated his
papers (including conversations with</p>
<p>high opinion of him both as a physician</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>TO THE END</p>
<p>763</p>
<p>Napoleon), and deported Las Cases and son to Cape Town (November
25,</p>
<p>1816). From that remote point the Count began years of wandering —
usually under hostile surveillance — in England, Belgium, and Germany.
In October, 1818, he presented to the Allies’ Congress of Aix
-la-Chapelle (Aachen) a petition from Napoleon’s mother for the release
of her son. He himself sent appeals to the rulers of Russia, Prussia,
Austria, and England. No answer came. After Napoleon’s death he was
allowed to return to France (1822). He secured from the British
government his confiscated manuscripts, and published nearly all of them
in the Memorial de Sainte-Helene (1823). The volumes became the literary
event of the year; Las Cases and his heirs were enriched by the sale;
and his ardent testimony to the treatment which, he believed, had cause
d Napoleon’s death became a continuing factor in the “Napoleonic legend”
that raised Napoleon III to a more lasting reign than his uncle’s, and
gave Las Cases, Jr., a senatorial seat in that Second Empire.</p>
<p>The other companions were jealous of Las Cases as being most fre-</p>
<p>quently and intimately near Napoleon. Especially irked was General
Gas- pard Gourgaud (1783-1852), who had many claims to favor. He had
fought for the Emperor in Spain, Austria, Russia, and France, and had
saved his life at Brienne. He was the most expressive and exuberant of
the exiles, ardent in friendship, passionate in enmity, challenging
Montholon to a duel, and lov- ing Napoleon with a jealous love
intolerant of other lovers; “he loves me,” said Napoleon, “as a lover
loves his mistress.” 21 To restore peace in the camp, Napoleon sent him
to Europe (1818) with a message for Czar Alexander. Even so, Gourgaud’s
Journal inedit de Sainte -Helene (1899) is the most fas- cinating and
realistic of all the echoes from St. Helena.</p>
<p>Comte Charles-Tristan de Montholon (1783-1853) hardly deserved</p>
<p>Gourgaud’s hatred, for he was the most polite and accommodating of
the imperial quartet. He had proud memories of having been taught mathe-
matics, when he was ten, by a young artillery captain called Bonaparte.
Later he followed Napoleon’s star in its rise and fall, and insisted on
accom - panying him to St. Helena. His wife, Albinie de Vassal, had come
to him from two divorced and living husbands, so that Montholon was
never quite sure of her. Gossip in St. Helena said she had helped
Napoleon to warm his bed; the Russian representatives at Jamestown put
the matter harshly: “Though old, debauched, and fat, she is today the
mistress of the great</p>

<li>THE GREAT DICTATOR</li>
</ol>
<p>The great enemy of all the exiles was time, and, next, its child,
ennui. These men, who had been addicts of action and familiars of death,
were</p>
<p>7&lt;4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xlimited now to caring for the body and ego of a world figure fallen
from imperial state and robes to imprisoned helplessness, with all his
ailments fes - tering and human frailties revealed. “My situation is
frightful,” he said; “1 am like a dead man, yet full of life” 24 or
desire thereof. The hero who for - merly had longed for more time to
meet his chosen tasks, or carry out his plans, now felt the hours heavy
on his hands, and welcomed night as an anodyne of time. Then, for lack
of labor done, he found it hard to sleep, and moved from bed to cot or
chair and back again in search of unconscious- ness.</p>
<p>Almost daily he played chess; but since no opponent dared defeat him,
he was bored by victory. In his first year of exile he had ridden his
horse several miles daily, but he soon abandoned this exercise when he
noted that some British officer always kept sight of him. He read
several hours a day.</p>
<p>He had always loved books, had done some reading even on busy days,
had taken hundreds of volumes on his campaigns — eight hundred to Water-
loo (seventy of them by Voltaire). 25 He had brought four hundred books
from France; on a stop of the Northumberland at Madeira he had sent the
British government a request for a number of learned works, which
reached him in June, 1 8 1 6; another package came a year later; and Sir
Hudson Lowe sent him some from his own library. 26 He became an expert
on the cam- paigns of Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar. He read and
reread the dramas of Corneille and Racine, sometimes aloud with his
companions, distributing the parts. He liked English literature, and had
Las Cases teach him enough English to read it, even to s peak it; “His
Majesty,” reported Gourgaud, “is always talking English to me.” 27</p>
<p>He had one advantage over other prisoners: he could drown the present
in the past by recounting the history of his country, and half of
Europe, from 1796 to 1815, almost entirely from memory, and from the
vantage of a principal participant. He was too impatient to write, but
he could talk. It was apparently Las Cases who suggested that by
dictating his memoirs to one or another of his entourage he could give
interest and value to every day. Now he might find only imperfect truth
in Dante’s lines “No greater pain than to recall, in misery, a time of
happiness”; a memory of pleasant days might soften, even while
deepening, present grief. “It was a beautiful em - pire!” he exclaimed;
“I had eighty -three million human beings under my government — half the
population of Europe.” 28</p>
<p>So he inaugurated a new dictatorship on the Northumberland, and con-
tinued it, on and off, for four years at St. Helena. He began by
recounting to Las Cases the story of those Italian campaigns of 1796
whose swift de- cisiveness had astonished Europe and made him
indispensable to France. When Las Cases fled before Lowe’ s wrath, the
Emperor dictated to Gour- gaud, later to Montholon, less to Bertrand,
sometimes to two of them in one day. Now these warriors changed their
swords for pens, and sallied forth in reams to shed their ink to save
their Emperor’s record and goo d name in re-Bourbonized France and in
the court of history. They were sooner ex- hausted than he, who felt
that this was his last chance to defend himself</p>

<p>TO THE END</p>

<p>against the orators, journalists, and cartoonists who had enabled his
enemies to picture him as an inhuman, bloodthirsty ogre. Knowing that
his recorders could not have so personal an urge to their labor, he gave
to each of them full title to his manuscript and its proceeds; and
actually each manuscript, when published, brought wealth to the scribe
or his heirs. 29</p>
<p>Naturally the author put the best face upon this apologia; but, all
in all, it has been found as fair as could be expected from a man
defending his life. Napoleon had by this time learned to admit that he
had made serious mistakes in policy and generalship. “I was wrong in
quarreling with Talley - rand. He possessed everything which I lacked.
If I had frankly allowed him to share my greatness he would have served
me well, and I would have died on the throne.” 30 He confessed that he
profoundly underestimated the diffi - culties of conquering Spain or
subduing Russia. “I started too soon from Elba. I should have waited
till the Congress had broken up, and the princes had returned home.” 31
“I don’t yet understand the loss of the battle of Water - loo.” 32 “I
should have died at Waterloo.” 33</p>
<p>His amanuenses, almost exhausted by his memories, yet found energy
left to record his conversation. It was of course interesting, for who
in his time had rivaled his range and excitement of adventures on three
continents? He was an excellent raconteur, with a lively anecdote for
any theme. He was, in his blunt way, a philosopher, and could speak
forgivably on any subject from agriculture to Zeus. He had read history
so widely that he predicted the future with some unreliable success.
“The colonial system… is finished for everybody — for England, which
owns all the colonies, as for the other powers, who have none left.” 34
The yoke of the Bourbons would soon be thrown off by the French people.
35 Germany would soon resume the unifi- cation which he had begun. 36
The nineteenth would be a century of revolu- tions; the principles of
the French Revolution, barring some excesses, would triumph in America,
France, and England; and “from this tripod the light will burst upon the
world.” 37 “The old system is ended, and the new one is not
consolidated, and will not be until after long and furious c
onvulsions.” 38 “Russia is the power that rushes most surely, and with
the greatest strides, toward universal dominion.” 39 One of his bad
guesses: “The royal authority in England, daily augmented,… is now
marching unimpeded on the high road to arbitrary and absolute power.”
40</p>
<p>Finally he reviewed his political career, and summed it up most
favorably:</p>
<p>I closed the gulf of anarchy and cleared the chaos. I purified the
Revolution, dignified nations, and established kings. I excited every
kind of emulation, re- warded every kind of merit, and extended the
limits of glory…. The dic- tatorship was absolutely necessary. Will it
be said that I restrained liberty? It can be proved that licentiousness,
anarchy, and the greatest irregularities still haunted the threshold of
freedom. Shall I be accused of having been too fond of war? It can be
shown that I always received the first attack. Will it be said that I
aimed at universal monarchy?… Our enemies themselves led me step by step
to this determination. Lastly, shall I be blamed for my ambition? This
passion I must doubtless be allowed to have possessed, and that in no
small degree; but, at the same time, my ambition was of the highest and
noblest kind</p>
<p>j66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xhat ever perhaps existed — that of establishing and consecrating the
empire of reason, and the full exercise and complete enjoyment of all
the human facul- ties. As here the historian will probably feel
compelled to regret that such am- bition should not have been fulfilled
and gratified…. This is my whole history in a few words. 41</p>
<p>On March 9, 1821, he warmed his failing heart with a proud vision of
his postmortem fame: “In five hundred years’ time French imaginations
will be full of me. They will talk only of the glory of our brilliant
campaigns. Heaven help anyone who dares speak ill of me!” 42 It was as
good as any way of facing death.</p>
<p>V. THE LAST BATTLE</p>
<p>A variety of internal disorders, and a lack of physical exercise,
brought Napoleon to old age while he was still in his forties. Lowe’s
insistence on having a British soldier follow the Emperor whenever the
latter rode out- side Longwood limits had angered the captive into
avoiding all rides, on horse or in caleche. Sentries stationed within
sight of his rooms gave Napo- leon a further reason for staying indoors;
and his loss of interest in pro- longing his life more and more inclined
him to a listless inactivity. Bertrand reported in 1818: “A hundred days
have elapsed since he… stirred out of the house.” Las Cases noted that
the Emperor’s blood circulated with diffi - culty, 43 with a pulse rate
as low as fifty-five beats per minute. 44</p>
<p>In 1820 he took to gardening, and attacked its problems with martial
cour- age and discipline. He conscripted his entire colony to join in
the enterprise, and they gladly turned from their old routine to the
novel business of dig- ging, carting, planting, watering, and weeding.
Sir Hudson Lowe, in a new gesture of amity, sent his prisoner plants and
tools. 45 The garden, well wa- tered, soon produced fresh vegetables
which Napoleon consumed with de- light. His health visibly impr oved.
But when the garden’s harvest had been consumed, and bad weather set in,
Napoleon returned to his former indoor indolence.</p>
<p>Soon his ailments resumed their attack, on a dozen fronts:
toothaches, headaches, skin eruptions, vomiting, dysentery, cold
extremities; his ulcer worsened, and the cancer that was to be revealed
by a postmortem autopsy had begun to give him almost uninterrupted pain.
40 These physical sufferings affected his mood, even his mind. He became
gloomy, irritable, and bitter; vain and jealous of his dignity; ready to
take offense but soon ready to for- give; counting his pennies but
giving generously in his will. 47 In 1820 he described himself
despondently:</p>
<p>How I have fallen! I, whose activity knew no limits, whose head never
rested! I am plunged into a lethargic stupor. I must make an effort to
raise my eyelids. Sometimes I used to dictate, on different subjects, to
four or five secre- taries, who wrote as fast as I spoke. But I was
Napoleon then; today I am nothing… I vegetate, I no longer live. 48</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>TO THE END</p>
<p>767</p>
<p>He had a succession and medley of doctors, none of whom remained with
him long enough to study his symptoms systematically, or to impose a
con- sistent regimen. Dr. O’Meara was the first and best, but his stay
at Long - wood was cut short. Two British physicians, Stokoe and Arnott,
replaced him, both of them good men, patient and conscientious. But on
September 21, 1819, the situation was confused by the arrival of
Dr. Francesco Antom- marchi, aged thirty- nine, with a recommendation
from Napoleon’s uncle, Cardinal Fesch; the British physicians allowed
him to take charge. Antom- marchi amply justified Napoleon’s question to
him, whether general s or doctors did the most killing. He was proud,
confident, and merciless when Napoleon complained of stomach pains.
Antommarchi prescribed an emetic in lemonade. Napoleon writhed in pain,
and almost gave up the ghost; think- ing himself poisoned, he dismissed
Antommarchi and forbade him to re- turn. 49 But in a day or two
Antommarchi was back with his chemicals and phials, and the Emperor,
though cursing him with unprintable obscenities, 50 had to put up with
him.</p>
<p>About the middle of March, 1821, Napoleon took to his bed, and there-
after rarely left it. He suffered almost continuous pain, which Antom-
marchi and Arnott tried to dull with repeated small doses of opium. “If
I should end my career now,” he said on March 27, “it would be a great
jo y. At times I have longed to die, and I have no fear of death.” 51
During his final month he vomited nearly all food given him.</p>
<p>On April 1 5 he made his will. Some excerpts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I die in the Apostolical Roman religion, in the bosom of which I was
born…. 2. It is my wish that my ashes may repose on the banks of the
Seine, in the midst of the French people, whom I have loved so well. 3.
I have always had reason to be pleased with my dearest wife, Marie
Louise. I retain for her, to my last moment, the most tender sentiments.
I beseech her to watch, in order to preserve, my son from the snares
which yet environ his infancy…. 5. I die prematurely, assassinated by
the English oligarchy. 52</li>
</ol>
<p>He had some 6 million francs to dispose of — 5.3 million plus
interest — on deposit with Laffitte; and he believed that he had 2
million francs left with Eugene de Beauharnais. He willed substantial
sums to Bertrand, Montholon, Las Cases; to his chief valet, Marchand,
and his secretary Meneval; to vari- ous generals or their children. He
bequeathed diverse articles to a consider- able number of persons who
had served or otherwise helped him; no one was forgotten. Also “10,000
francs to the officer Cantillon, who has undergone a trial on the charge
of having endeavored to assassinate Lord Wellington, of which he was
pronounced innocent. Cantillon had as much right to assas- sinate that
oligarchist as the latter had to send me to perish on the rock of
St. Helena.” 53</p>
<p>Separately he left some “Advice to My Son” (spring, 1821):</p>
<p>My son must not think of avenging my death; he should rather learn a
lesson from it. He must always bear in mind the remembrance of what I
have accom- plished. He is always to remain, like myself, every inch a
Frenchman. He must strive to rule in peace. If he were to try to begin
my wars all over again out of</p>
<p>768</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xa mere desire to imitate me, and without the absolute necessity for
it, he would be nothing but an ape. To begin my work over again would be
to assume that I had accomplished nothing. To complete it, on the other
hand, will be to prove the strength of its foundations, to explain the
complete plan of the edi- fice begun. Such work as mine is not done
twice in a century. I have been compelled to restrain and tame Europe
with arms; today it must be convinced. I have saved the Revolution as it
lay dying. I have cleansed it of its crimes, and have held it up to the
people shining with fame. I have inspired France and Europe with new
ideas which will never be forgotten. May my son make everything blossom
that I have sown! May he develop further all the elements of prosperity
which lie hidden in French soil ! 84</p>
<p>The last preparation was to dispose of his soul. He had taken a long
time to reach religious belief. As if he had read Gibbon, he seems to
have con- sidered all religions as equally false to the philosopher, and
equally useful to the statesman; 56 he had become a Mohammedan to win
Egypt, and a Catho- lic to hold France. To Gourgaud he had expressed
simple materialism: “Say what you like, everything is matter, more or
less organized. When out hunt- ing I had the deer cut open, and saw that
their interior was the same as that of man. When I see that a pig has a
stomach like mine, and digests like me, I say to myself, ‘If I have a
soul, so has he.’” 66 “When we are dead, my dear Gourgaud, we are
altogether dead.” 57 On March 27, six weeks before his death, he said to
Bertrand, “I am very glad that I have no religion. I find this a great
consolation, as I have no imaginary terror, and no fear of the fu-
ture.” 58 How, he asked, can we reconcile the prosperity of the wicked,
and the misfortunes of the saints, with the existence of a just God?
“Look at Talleyrand; he is sure to die in bed.” 59</p>
<p>As he neared death he began to find reasons for faith. “Only a
madman,” he told Gourgaud, “declares that he will die without a confess
ion. There is so much that one does not know, that one cannot explain.”
60 After all, he felt, religion is a necessary part of patriotism:</p>
<p>Religion forms a part of our destiny. Together with the soil, laws,
and cus- toms, it constitutes the sacred whole which we call Fatherland,
and whose in- terests we should never desert. When, at the time of the
Concordat, some old revolutionists spoke to me of making France
Protestant, I felt as much re- volted as though they had asked me to
abdicate my title of Frenchman and declare myself English or German.
01</p>
<p>So he decided to humbly conform to the traditional rituals of a
French- man’s death. He found a local priest, and arranged to have Mass
celebrated</p>
<p>By April 26 he was so weak that for the first time he obeyed his
doctors without question. That evening he raved for a while, proposing
to give his son 400 million francs. 63 Montholon, who now stayed “wfith
him night and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>TO THE END</p>
<p>day, reported that about 4 a.m. of April 26 Napoleon told him, “with
ex - traordinary emotion,” “I have just see n my good Josephine…. She
was sit- ting there; it was as if I had seen her only the night before.
She hasn’t changed — always the same, still completely devoted to me.
She told me that we were going to see each other again, never again to
leave each other. She has promised me. Did you see her?” 64</p>
<p>On May 3 he received the sacraments. On that day two physicians were
added to Arnott and Antommarchi, and the four agreed to give the patient
ten grains of calomel. “The unusually enormous dose of this unsuitable
drug caused a terrible intestinal upheaval, with loss of consciousness,
and… all the signs of a hemorrhage in the gastro- intestinal system.”
65</p>
<p>He died on May 5, 1821, murmuring, “ A la tete de I’armee — at the
head of the army.”</p>
<p>On May 6 Antommarchi conducted the postmortem examination, in the
presence of sixteen others, including seven British surgeons, Bertrand,
and Montholon. The autopsy revealed at once the chief cause o f
Napoleon’s suffering: cancerous ulcers in the pylorus — that part of the
stomach which leads into the intestine. One ulcer had eaten a
quarter-inch hole through the stomach wall, spreading putrefaction.
Antommarchi had diagnosed hepatitis, but the liver, though larger than
normal, showed no sign of disease. 66 Adi- pose tissue was found not
only in the skin and the peritoneum, but also in the heart, which may
have caused its abnormally slow beat. The bladder was small, and
contained several small stones; this, and a malformed left kidney,
probably caused the Emperor’s need for frequent urination, and may
explain a certain inconstancy of attention to the course of battle at
Borodino and Waterloo. None of the examiners reported any sign of
syphilis, but the geni- tals were small and apparently atrophied. 67</p>
<p>On May 9 a considerable procession, including Sir Hudson Lowe, es-
corted the corpse to a grave outside Longwood, in the “Valley of the
Geraniums”; Napoleon himself had chosen the location. O n the coffin lay
the mantle he had worn at Marengo, and the sword which had been a proud
part of his official costume, and an emblem of his life. There he
remained for nineteen years, until France, loving him again, brought him
home.</p>
