<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>sidered it weak-kneed and unseemly to preserve food for the next day.
8 The natives of Australia are incapable of any labor whose reward is
not immediate; every Hottentot is a gentleman of leisure; and with the
Bush- men of Africa it is always “either a. feast or a famine.” 4 There
is a mute wisdom in this improvidence, as in many “savage” ways. The
moment man begins to take thought of the morrow he passes out of the
Garden of Eden into the vale of anxiety; the pale cast of worry settles
down upon him, greed is sharpened, property begins, and the good cheer
of the “thoughtless” native disappears. The American Negro is making
this</p>
<p>transition toda y. “Of what are you thinking?” Peary asked one of his
Eskimo guides. “I do not have to think,” was the answer; “I have plenty
of meat.” Not to think unless we have to— there is much to be said for
this as the summation of wisdom.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were difficulties in this care-lessness, and
those or- ganisms that outgrew it came to possess a serious advantage in
the struggle for survival. The dog that buried .the bone which even a
canine appetite could not manage, the squirrel that gathered nuts for a
later feast, the bees that filled the comb with honey, the ants that
laid up stores for a rainy day — these were among the first creators of
civilization. It was they, or other subtle creatures like them, who
taught our ancestors the art of providing for tomorrow out of the
surplus of today, or of preparing for winter in summer’s time of
plenty.</p>
<p>With what skill those ancestors ferreted out, from land and sea, the
food that was the basis of their simple societies! They grubbed edible
things from the earth with bare hands; they imitated or used the claws
and tusks of the animals, and fashioned tools out of ivory, bone or
stone; they made nets and traps and snares of rushes or fibre, and
devised innumerable artifices for fishing and hunting their prey. The
Polynesians had nets a thousand ells long, which could be handled only
by a hundred men; in such ways economic provision grew hand in hand with
political organization, and the united quest for food helped to generate
the state. The Tlingit fisherman put upon his head a cap like the head
of a seal, and hiding his body among the rocks, made a noise like a
seal; seals came toward him, and he speared them with the clear
conscience of primitive war. Many tribes threw narcotics into the
streams to stupefy the fish into cooperation with the fishermen; the
Tahitians, for example, put into the water an in- toxicating mixture
prepared from the huteo nut or the hora plant; the fish, drunk with it,
floated leisurely on the surface, and were caught at the</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>anglers’ will. Australian natives, swimming under water while
breathing through a reed, pulled ducks beneath the surface by the legs,
and gently held them there till they were pacified. The Tarahumaras
caught birds by stringing kernels on tough fibres half buried under the
ground; the birds ate the kernels, and the Tarahumaras ate the birds.
6</p>
<p>Hunting is now to most of us a game, whose relish seems based upon
some mystic remembrance, in the blood, of ancient days when to hunter as
well as hunted it was a matter of life and death. For hunting was not
merely a quest for food, it was a war for security and mastery, a war
beside which all the wars of recorded history are but a little noise. In
the jungle man still fights for his life, for though there is hardly an
animal that will attack him unless it is desperate for food or cornered
in the chase, yet there is not always food for all, and sometimes only
the fighter, or the breeder of fighters, is allowed to eat. We see in
our museums the relics of that war of the species in the knives, clubs,
spears, arrows, lassos, bolas, lures, traps, boomerangs and slings with
which primitive men won posses- sion of the land, and prepared to
transmit to an ungrateful posterity the gift of security from every
beast except man. Even today, after all</p>
<p>these wars of elimination, how many different populations move over
the earth! Sometimes, during a walk in the woods, one is awed by the
variety of languages spoken there, by the myriad species of insects,
reptiles, carni- vores and birds; one feels that man is an interloper on
this crowded scene, that he is the object of universal dread and endless
hostility. Some day, perhaps, these chattering quadrupeds, these
ingratiating centipedes, these insinuating bacilli, will devour man and
all his works, and free the planet from this marauding biped, these
mysterious and unnatural weapons, these careless feet!</p>
<p>Hunting and fishing were not stages in economic development, they
were modes of activity destined to survive into the highest forms of
civil- ized society. Once the center of life, they are still its hidden
foundations; behind our literature and philosophy, our ritual and art,
stand the stout killers of Packingtown. We do our hunting by proxy, not
having the</p>
<p>stomach for honest killing in the fields; but our memories of the
chase linger in our joyful pursuit of anything weak or fugitive, and in
the games of our children — even in the word game. In the last analysis
civilization is based upon the food supply. The cathedral and the
capitol, the museum and the concert chamber, the library and the
university are the fa£ade; in the rear are the shambles.</p>
<p>8 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. II</p>
<p>To live by hunting was not original; if man had confined himself
to</p>
<p>that he would have been just another carnivore. He began to be human
when out of the uncertain hunt he developed the greater security and
continuity of the pastoral life. For this involved advantages of high
import- ance: the domestication of animals, the breeding of cattle, and
the use of milk. We do not know when or how domestication began —
perhaps when the helpless young of slain beasts were spared and brought
to the camp as pla ythings for the children.” The animal continued to be
eaten, but not so soon; it acted as a beast of burden, but it was
accepted almost demo- cratically into the society of man; it became his
comrade, and formed with him a community of labor and residence. The
miracle of reproduc- tion was brought under control, and two captives
were multiplied into a herd. Animal milk released women from prolonged
nursing, lowered infantile mortality, and provided a new and dependable
food. Population increased, life became more stable and orderly, and the
mastery of that timid parvenu, man, became more secure on the earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile woman was making the greatest economic discovery of</p>
<p>all — the bounty of the soil. While man hunted she grubbed about the
tent or hut for whatever edible things lay ready to her hand on the
ground. In Australia it was understood that during the absence of her
mate on the chase the wife would dig for roots, pluck fruit and nuts
from the trees, and collect honey, mushrooms, seeds and natural grains .
7 Even today, in certain tribes of Australia, the grains that grow
spontaneously out of the earth are harvested without any attempt to
separate and sow the seed; the Indians of the Sacramento River Valley
never advanced beyond this stag e.” We shall never discover when men
first noted the function of the seed, and turned collecting into sowing;
such beginnings are the mysteries of his- tory, about which we may
believe and guess, but cannot know. It is</p>
<p>possible that when men began to collect unplanted grains, seeds fell
along the way between field and camp, and suggested at last the great
secret of growth. The Juangs threw the seeds together into the ground,
leaving them to find their own way up. The natives of Borneo put the
seed into holes which they dug with a pointed stick as they walked the
fields.” The simplest known culture of the earth is with this stick or
“digger.” In Mada - gascar fifty years ago the traveler could still see
women armed with pointed sticks, standing in a row like soldiers, and
then, at a signal, digging their sticks into the ground, turning over
the soil, throwing in the seed, stamp- ing the earth flat, and passing
on to another furrow . 10 The second stage in</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 9</p>
<p>complexity was culture with the hoe: the digging stick was tipped
with bone, and fitted with a crosspiece to receive the pressure of the
foot. When the Conquistadores arrived in Mexico they found that the
Aztecs knew no other tool of tillage than the hoe. With the
domestication of animals and the forging of metals a heavier implement
could be used; the hoe was enlarged into a plough, and the deeper
turning of the soil revealed a fertility in the earth that changed the
whole career of man. Wild plants were domesticated, new varieties were
developed, old varieties were improved.</p>
<p>Finally nature taught man the art of provision, the virtue of
prudence,* the concept of time. Watching woodpeckers storing acorns in
the trees, and the bees storing honey in hives, man conceived — perhaps
after millen- niums of improvident savagery — the notion of laying up
food for the future. He found ways of preserving meat by smoking it,
salting it, freezing it; better still, he built granaries secure from
rain and damp, vermin and thieves, and gathered food into them for the
leaner months of the year. Slowly it became apparent that agriculture
could provide a better and steadier food supply than hunting. With that
realization man took one of the three steps that led from the beast to
civilization — speech, agriculture, and writing.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that man passed suddenly from hunting to</p>
<p>tillage. Many tribes, like the American Indians, remained permanently
becalmed in the transition — the men given to the chase, the women
tilling the soil. Not only was the change presumably gradual, but it was
never complete. Man merely added a new way of securing food to an old
way; and for the most part, throughout his history, he has preferred the
old food to the new. We picture early man experimenting with a thousand
products of the earth to find, at much cost to his inward comfort, which
of them could be eaten safely; mingling these more and more with the
fruits and nuts, the flesh and fish he was accustomed to, but always
yearn- ing for the booty of the chase. Primitive peoples are ravenously
fond of meat, even when they live mainly on cereals, vegetables and milk
. 11 If they come upon the carcass of a recently dead animal the result
is likely to be a wild debauch. Very often no time is wasted on cooking;
the prey is eaten raw, as fast as good teeth can tear and devour it;
soon nothing is left but the bones. Whole tribes have been known to
feast for a week on a</p>

prudence.</p>
<p>IO THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. H</p>
<p>whale thrown up on the shore.“ Though the Fuegians can cook, they
prefer their meat raw; when they catch a fish they kill it by biting it
behind the gills, and then consume it from head to tail without further
ritual.“ The uncertainty of the food supply made these nature peoples
almost lit- erally omnivorous: shellfish, sea urchins, frogs, toads,
snails, mice, rats, spiders, earthworms, scorpions, moths, centipedes,
locusts, caterpillars, liz- ards, snakes, boas, dogs, horses, roots,
lice, insects, larvae, the eggs of rep- tiles and birds — there is not
one of these but was somewhere a delicacy, or even a piece de
resistance, to primitive men . 14 Some tribes are expert hunt- ers of
ants; others dry insects in the sun and then store them for a feast;
others pick the lice out of one another’s hair, and eat them with
relish; if a great number of lice can be gathered to make a petite
marmite, they are devoured with shouts of joy, as enemies of the human
race . 15 The menu of the lower hunting tribes hardly differs from that
of the higher apes . 15</p>
<p>The discovery of fire limited this indiscriminate voracity, and
cooperated with agriculture to free man from the chase. Cooking broke
down the cellulose and starch of a thousand plants indigestible in their
raw state, and man turned more and more to cereals and vegetables as his
chief reli- ance. At the same time cooking, by softening tough foods,
reduced the need of chewing, and began that decay of the teeth which is
one of the insignia of civilization.</p>
<p>To all the varied articles of diet that we have enumerated, man added
the greatest delicacy of all — his fellowman. Cannibalism was at one
time practically universal; it has been found in nearly all primitive
tribes, and among such later peoples as the Irish, the Iberians, the
Piets, and the eleventh-century Danes . 17 Among many tribes human flesh
was a staple of trade, and funerals were unknown. In the Upper Congo
living men, women and children were bought and sold frankly as articles
of food ; 18 on the island of New Britain human meat was sold in shops
as butcher’s meat is sold among ourselves; and in some of the Solomon
Islands human victims, preferably women, were fattened for a feast like
pigs . 10 The Fuegians ranked women above dogs because, they said, “dogs
taste of otter.” In Tahiti an old Polynesian chief explained his diet to
Pierre Loti: “The white man, when well roasted, tastes like a ripe
banana.” The Fiji - ans, however, complained that the flesh of the
whites was too salty and tough, and that a European sailor was hardly
fit to eat; a Polynesian tasted better.”</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>What was the origin of this practice? There is no surety that the</p>
<p>custom arose, as formerly supposed, out of a shortage of other food;
if it did, the taste once formed survived the shortage, and became a
passionate predilection.” Everywhere among nature peoples blood is r
egarded as a delicacy — never with horror; even primitive vegetarians
take to it with gusto. Human blood is constantly drunk by tribes
otherwise kindly and generous; sometimes as medicine, sometimes as a
rite or covenant, often in the belief that it will add to the drinker
the vital force of the victim . 22 No shame was felt in preferring human
flesh; primitive man seems to have recognized no distinction in morals
between eating men and eating other animals. In Melanesia the chief who
could treat his friends to a dish of roast man soared in social esteem.
“When I have slain an enemy,” ex - plained a Brazilian philosopher-
chief, “it is surely better to eat him than to let him waste. . . . The
worst is not to be eaten, but to die; if I am</p>
<p>killed it is all the same whether my tribal enemy eats me or not. But
I could not think of any game that would taste better than he would. . .
. You whites are really too dainty .” 23</p>
<p>Doubtless the custom had certain social advantages. It anticipated
Dean Swift’s plan for the utilization of superfluous children, and it
gave the old an opportunity to die usefully. There is a point of view
from which funer- als seem an unnecessary extravagance. To Montaigne it
appeared more barbarous to torture a man to death under the cover of
piety, as was the mode of his time, than to roast and eat him after he
was dead. We must respect one another’s delusions.</p>

<li>THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDUSTRY</li>
</ol>
<p>Fire — Primitive Tools — Weaving and pottery — Building and
trans-</p>
<p>port — Trade and finance</p>
<p>If man began with speech, and civilization with agriculture, industry
began with fire. Man did not invent it; probably nature produced the
marvel for him by the friction of leaves or twigs, a stroke of
lightning, or a chance union of chemicals; man merely had the saving wit
to imitate nature, and to improve upon her. He put the wonder to a
thousand uses. First, perhaps, he made it serve as a torch to conquer
his fearsome enemy, the dark; then he used it for warmth, and moved more
freely from his native tropics to less enervating zones, slowly making
the planet human; then he applied it to metals, softening them,
tempering them, and com-</p>
<p>12 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. II</p>
<p>bining them into forms stronger and suppler than those in which they
had come to his hand. So beneficent and strange was it that fire always
re- mained a miracle to primitive man, fit to be worshiped as a god; he
offered it countless ceremonies of devotion, and made it the center or
focus (which is Latin for hearth) of his life and home; he carried it
carefully with him as he moved from place to place in his wanderings,
and would not will- ingly let it die. Even the Romans punished with
death the careless vestal virgin who allowed the sacred fire to be
extinguished.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the midst of hunting, herding and agriculture,
invention was busy, and the primitive brain was racking itself to find
mechanical answers to the economic puzzles of life. At first man was
content, appar- ently, to accept what nature offered him — the fruits of
the earth as his food, the skins and furs of the animals as his
clothing, the caves in the hillsides as his home. Then, perhaps (for
most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice), he imitated the
tools and industry of the animal: he saw the monkey flinging rocks and
fruit upon his enemies, or breaking open nuts and oysters with a stone;
he saw the beaver building a dam, the birds making nests and bowers, the
chimpanzees raising something very like a hut. He envied the power of
their claws, teeth, tusks and horns, and the toughness of their hides;
and he set to work to fashion tools and weapons that would resemble and
rival these. Man, said Franklin, is a tool-using animal ; 31 but this,
too, like the other distinctions on which we plume our- selves, is only
a difference of degree.</p>
<p>Many tools lay potential in the plant world that surrounded primitive
man. From the bamboo he made shafts, knives, needles and bottles; out of
branches he made tongs, pincers and vices; from bark and fibres he wove
cord and clothing of a hundred kinds. Above all, he made himself a
stick. It was a modest invention, but its uses were so varied that man
always looked upon it as a symbol of power and authority, from the wand
of the fairies and the staff of the shepherd to the rod of Moses or
Aaron, the ivory cane of the Roman consul, the lituus of the augurs, and
the mace of the magistrate or the king. In agriculture the stick became
the hoe; in war it became the lance or javelin or spear, the sword or
bayonet . 35 Again, man used the mineral world, and shaped stones into a
museum of arms and implements: hammers, anvils, kettles, scrapers,
arrow-heads, saws, planes, wedges, levers, axes and drills. From the
animal world he made ladles, spoons, vases, gourds, plates, cups, razors
and hooks out of the shells of the shore, and tough or dainty tools out
of the horn or ivory, the</p>

<p>teeth and bones, the hair and hide of the beasts. Most of these
fashioned articles had handles of wood, attached to them in cunning
ways, bound with braids of fibre or cords of animal sinew, and
occasionally glued with strange mixtures of blood. The ingenuity of
primitive men prob- ably equaled — perhaps it surpassed — that of the
average modem man; we differ from them through the social accumulation
of knowledge, materials and tools, rather than through innate
superiority of brains. Indeed, nature men delight in mastering the
necessities of a situation with inventive wit. It was a favorite game
among the Eskimos to go off into difficult and de- serted places, and
rival one another in devising means for meeting the needs of a life
unequipped and unadorned.”</p>
<ul>
<li>This primitive skill displayed itself proudly in the art of weaving.
Here, too, the animal showed man the way. The web of the spider, the
nest of the bird, the crossing and texture of fibres and leaves in the
natural em- broidery of the woods, set an example so obvious that in all
probability weav- ing was one of the earliest arts of the human race.
Bark, leaves and grass fibres were woven into clothing, carpets and
tapestry, sometimes so excellent that it could not be rivaled today,
even with the resources of contemporary machinery. Aleutian women may
spend a year in weaving one robe. The blankets and garments made by the
North American Indians were richly ornamented with fringes and
embroideries of hairs and tendon-threads dyed in brilliant colors with
berry juice; colors “so alive,” says Father Theodut, “that ours do not
seem even to approach them .” 21 Again art began where</li>
</ul>
<p>Akin to basketry, perhaps born of it, was the art of pottery. Clay
placed upon wickerwork to keep the latter from being burned, hardened
into a fireproof shell which kept its form when the wickerwork was taken
away ; 29 this may have been the first stage of a development that was
to culminate in the perfect porcelains of China. Or perhaps some lumps
of clay, baked and hardened by the sun, suggested the ceramic art; it
was but a step from this to substitute fire for the sun, and to form
from the earth myriad shapes of vessels for every use — for cooking,
storing and transporting, at last for</p>

the wet clay were one of the first forms of art, and perhaps one of the
origins of writing.</p>
<p>Out of sun-dried clay primitive tribes made bricks and adobe, and
dwelt, so to speak, in pottery. But that was a late stage of the
building art, bind- ing the mud hut of the “savage” in a chain of
continuous development with the brilliant tiles of Nineveh and Babylon.
Some primitive peoples, like the Veddahs of Ceylon, had no dwellings at
all, and were content with the earth and the sky; some, like the
Tasmanians, slept in hollow trees; some, like the natives of New South
Wales, lived in caves; others, like the Bush- men, built here and there
a wind-shelter of branches, or, more rarely, drove piles into the soil
and covered their tops with moss and twigs. From such wind-shelters,
when sides were added, evolved the hut, which is found among the natives
of Australia in all its stages from a tiny cottage of branches, grass
and earth large enough to cover two or three persons, to great huts
housing thirty or more. The nomad hunter or herdsman pre- ferred a tent,
which he could carry wherever the chase might lead him. The higher type
of nature peoples, like the American Indian, built with wood; the
Iroquois, for example, raised, out of timber still bearing the bark,
sprawling edifices five hundred feet long, which sheltered many fami-
lies. Finally, the natives of Oceania made real houses of carefully cut
boards, and the evolution of the wooden dwelling was complete . 80</p>
<p>Only three further developments were needed for primitive man to
create all the essentials of economic civilization: the mechanisms of
trans- port, the processes of trade, and the medium of exchange. The
porter carrying his load from a modem plane pictures the earliest and
latest stages in the history of transportation. In the beginning,
doubtless, man was his own beast of burden, unless he was married; to
this day, for the most part, in southern and eastern Asia, man is wagon
and donkey and all. Then he invented ropes, levers, and pulleys; he
conquered and loaded the animal; he made the first sledge by having his
cattle draw along the ground long branches bearing his goods;* he put
logs as rollers under the sledge; he cut cross-sections of the log, and
made the greatest of all mechanical inven- tions, the wheel; he put
wheels under the sledge and made a cart. Other logs he bound together as
rafts, or dug into canoes; and the streams be- came his most convenient
avenues of transport. By land he went first through trackless fields and
hills, then by trails, at last by roads. He studied the stars, and
guided his caravans across mountains and deserts by tracing</p>

<p>CHAP. Il) ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 15</p>
<p>his route in the sky. He paddled, rowed or sailed his way bravely
from island to island, and at last spanned oceans to spread his modest
culture from continent to continent. Here, too, the main problems were
solved before written history began.</p>
<p>Since human skills and natural resources are diversely and unequally
distributed, a people may be enabled, by the development of specific
talents, or by its proximity to needed materials, to produce certain
articles more cheaply than its neighbors. Of such articles it makes more
than it con- sumes, and offers its surplus to other peoples in exchange
for their own; this is the origin of trade. The Chibcha Indians of
Colombia exported the rock salt that abounded in their territory, and
received in return the cereals that could not be raised on their barren
soil. Certain American Indian villages were almost entirely devoted to
making arrow-heads; some in New Guinea to making pottery; some in Africa
to blacksmithing, or to making boats or lances. Such specializing tribes
or villages sometimes ac- quired the names of their industry (Smith,
Fisher, Potter . . . ), and these names were in time attached to
specializing families.” 8 Trade in surpluses was at first by an
interchange of gifts; even in our calculating days a present (if only a
meal) sometimes precedes or seals a trade. The ex- change was
facilitated by war, robbery, tribute, fines, and compensation; goods had
to be kept moving! Gradually an orderly system of barter grew up, and
trading posts, markets and bazaars were established — occa- sionally,
then periodically, then permanently — where those who had some article
in excess might offer it for some article of need.”</p>
<p>For a long time commerce was purely such exchange, and centuries
passed before a circulating medium of value was invented to quicken
trade. A Dyak might be seen wandering for days through a bazaar, with a
ball of beeswax in his hand, seeking a customer who could offer him in
return something that he might more profitably use.” The earliest
mediums of exchange were articles universally in demand, which anyone
would take in payment: dates, salt, skins, furs, ornaments, implements,
weapons; in such traffic two knives equaled one pair of stockings, all
three equaled a blanket, all four equaled a gun, all five equaled a
horse; two elk-teeth equaled one pony, and eight ponies equaled a wife.”
There is hardly any thing that has not been employed as money by some
people at some time: beans, fish-hooks, shells, pearls, beads, cocoa
seeds, tea, pepper, at last sheep, pigs, cows, and slaves. Cattle were a
convenient standard of value and medium of exchange among hunters and
herders; they bore interest</p>
<p>1 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. II</p>
<p>through breeding, and they were easy to carry, since they transported
themselves. Even in Homer’s days men and things were valued in terms of
cattle: the armor of Diomedes was worth nine head of cattle, a skilful
slave was worth four. The Romans used kindred words — pecus and pecunia
— for cattle and money, and placed the image of an ox upon their early
coins. Our own words capital, chattel and cattle go back through the
French to the Latin capitate, meaning property: and this in turn</p>
<p>derives from caput, meaning head — i.e., of cattle. When metals were
mined they slowly replaced other articles as standards of value; copper,
bronze, iron, finally — because of their convenient representation of
great worth in little space and weight — silver and gold, became the
money of mankind. The advance from token goods to a metallic currency
does not seem to have been made by primitive men; it was left for the
historic civilizations to invent coinage and credit, and so, by further
facilitating the exchange of surpluses, to increase again the wealth and
comfort of man . 84</p>

<li>ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION</li>

<p>Primitive communism — Causes of its disappearance — Origins of</p>
<p>private property — Slavery — Classes</p>
<p>Trade was the great disturber of the primitive world, for until it
came, bringing money and profit in its wake, there was no property, and
there- fore little government. In the early stages of economic
development property was limited for the most part to things personally
used; the property sense applied so strongly to such articles that they
(even the wife) were often buried with their owner; it applied so weakly
to things not personally used that in their case the sense of property,
far from being innate, required perpetual reinforcement and
inculcation.</p>
<p>Almost everywhere, among primitive peoples, land was owned by the
community. The North American Indians, the natives of Peru, the</p>
<p>Chittagong Hill tribes of India, the Borneans and South Sea Islanders
seem to have owned and tilled the soil in common, and to have shared the
fruits together. “The land,” said the Omaha Indians, “is like water and
wind— what cannot be sold.” In Samoa the idea of selling land was
unknown prior to the coming of the white man. Professor Rivers found
communism in land still existing in Melanesia and Polynesia; and in
inner Liberia it may be observed today . 85</p>
<p>Only less widespread was communism in food. It was usual among</p>
<p>i7</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>“savages” for the man who had food to share it with the man who had
none, for travelers to be fed at any home they chose to stop at on their
way, and for communities harassed with drought to be maintained by their
neighbors . 30 If a man sat down to his meal in the woods he was
expected to call loudly for some one to come and share it with him,
before he might justly eat alone . 11 When Turner told a Samoan about
the poor in London the “savage” asked in astonishment: “How is it? N o
food? No friends? No house to live in? Where did he grow? Are there
no</p>
<p>houses belonging to his friends ?” 38 The hungry Indian had but to
ask to receive; no matter how small the supply was, food was given him
if he needed it; “no one can want food wh ile there is com anywhere in
the town .” 30 Among the Hottentots it was the custom for one who had
more than others to share his surplus till all were equal. White
travelers in Africa before the advent of civilization noted that a
present of food or ot her valuables to a “black man” was at once
distributed; so that when a suit of clothes was given to one of them the
donor soon found the recipient wearing the hat, a friend the trousers,
another friend the coat. The Eskimo hunter had no personal right to his
catch; it had to be divided among the inhabitants of the village, and
tools and provisions were the common property of all. The North American
Indians were described by Captain Carver as “strangers to all
distinctions of property, except in the articles of domestic use. . . .
They are extremely liberal to each other, and supply the deficiencies of
their friends with any superfluity of their own.” “What is extremely
surprising,” reports a missionary, “is to see them treat one another
with a gentleness and consideration which one does not find among common
people in the most civilized nations. This, doubt- less, arises from the
fact that the words ‘mine’ and ‘thine,’ which St.</p>
<p>Chrysostom says extinguish in our hearts the fire of charity and
kindle that of greed, are unknown to these savages.” “I have seen them,”
says another observer, “divide game among themselves when they sometimes
had many shares to make; and cannot recollect a single instance of their
falling into a dispute or finding fault with the distribution as being
unequal or otherwise objectionable. They would rather lie down
themselves on an empty stomach than have it laid to their charge that
they neglected to satisfy the needy. . . . They look upon themselves as
but one great family .” 40</p>
<p>Why did this primitive communism disappear as men rose to what we,
with some partiality, call civilization? Sumner believed that
communism</p>
<p>l8 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. H</p>
<p>proved unbiological, a handicap in the struggle for existence; that
it gave insufficient stimulus to inventiveness, industry and thrift; and
that the failure to reward the more able, and punish the less able, made
for a level- ing of capacity which was hostile to growth or to
successful competition with other groups.“ Loskiel reported some Indian
tribes of the northeast as “so lazy that they plant nothing themselves,
but rely entirely upon the expectation that others will not refuse to
share their produce with them. Since the industrious thus enjoy no more
of the fruits of their labor than the idle, they plant less every
year.”“ Darwin thought that the perfect</p>
<p>dividualism brought wealth, but it brought, also, insecurity and
slavery; it stimulated the latent powers of superior men, but it
intensified the com- petition of life, and made men feel bitterly a
poverty which, when all shared it alike, had seemed to oppress
none.*</p>
<p>Communism could survive more easily in societies where men were
always on the move, and danger and want were ever present. Hunters and
herders had no need of private property in land; but when agriculture
became the settled life of men it soon appeared that the land was most
fruitfully tilled when the rewards of careful husbandry accrued to the
family that had provided it. Consequently — since there is a natural
selec- tion of institutions and ideas as well as of organisms and groups
— the passage from hunting to agriculture brought a change from tribal
property to family property; the most economical unit of production
became the</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps one reason why communism tends to appear chiefly at the
beginning of civili- zations is that it flourishes most readily in times
of dearth, when the common danger of starvation fuses the individual
into the group. When abundance comes, and the danger subsides, social
cohesion is lessened, and individualism increases; communism ends where
luxury begins. As the life of a society becomes more complex, and the
division of labor differentiates men into diverse occupations and
trades, it becomes more and more unlikely that all these services will
be equally valuable to the group; inevitably those whose greater ability
enables them to perform the more vital functions will take more than
their equal share of the rising wealth of the group. Every growing
civilization is a scene of multiply - ing inequalities; the natural
differences of human endowment unite with differences of opportunity to
produce artificial differences of wealth and power; and where no laws or
despots suppress these artificial inequalities they reach at last a
bursting point where the poor have nothing to lose by violence, and the
chaos of revolution levels men again into a community of
destitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the dream of communism lurks in every modem society as a racial
memory of a</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) ECONOMIC ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 19</p>
<p>unit of ownership. As the family took on more and more a patriarchal
form, with authority centralized in the oldest male, property became
increasingly individualized, and personal bequest arose. Frequently an
enterprising individual would leave the family haven, adventure beyond
the traditional boundaries, and by hard labor reclaim land from the
forest, the jungle or the marsh; such land he guarded jealously as his
own, and in the end society recognized his right, and another form of
individual property began.“* As the pressure of population increased,
and older lands were exhausted, such reclamation went on in a widening
circle, until, in the more complex societies, individual ownership
became the order of the day. The invention of money cooperated with
these factors by facili- tating the accumulation, transport and
transmission of property. The old tribal rights and traditions
reasserted themselves in the technical owner- ship of the soil by the
village community or the king, and in periodical redistributions of the
land; but after an epoch of natural oscillation between the old and the
new, private property established itself definitely as the basic
economic institution of historical society.</p>
<p>Agriculture, while generating civilization, led not only to private
prop- erty but to slavery. In purely hunting communities slavery had
been unknown; the hunter’s wives and children sufficed to do the menial
work. The men alternated between the excited activity of hunting or war,
and the exhausted lassitude of satiety or peace. The characteristic
laziness of primitive peoples had its origin, presumably, in this habit
of slowly re- cuperating from the fatigue of battle or the chase; it was
not so much laziness as rest. To transform this spasmodic activity into
regular work two things were needed: the routine of tillage, and the
organization of labor.</p>
<p>Such organization remains loose and spontaneous where men are work-
ing for themselves; where they work for others, the organization of
labor simpler and more equal life; and where inequality or insecurity
rises beyond sufferance, men welcome a return to a condition which they
idealize by recalling its equality and. forgetting its poverty.
Periodically the land gets itself redistributed, legally or not, whether
by the Gracchi in Rome, the Jacobins in France, or the Communists in
Russia; periodically wealth is redistributed, whether by the violent
confiscation of property, or by confiscatory taxation of incomes and
bequests. Then the race for wealth, goods and power begins again, and
the pyramid of ability takes form once more; under whatever laws may be
enacted the abler man manages somehow to get the richer soil, the better
place, the lion’s share; soon he is strong enough to dominate the state
and rewrite or interpret the laws; and in time the inequality is as
great as before. In this aspect all economic history is the slow
heart-beat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of
naturally concentrating wealth and naturally explosive revolution.</p>
<p>20 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. II</p>
<p>depends in the last analysis upon force. The rise of agriculture and
the inequality of men led to the employment of the socially weak by the
socially strong; not till then did it occur to the victor in war that
the only good prisoner is a live one. Butchery and cannibalism lessened,
slavery grew . 44 It was a great moral improvement when men ceased to
kill or eat their fellowmen, and merely made them slaves. A similar
develop- ment on a larger scale may be seen today, when a nation
victorious in war no longer exterminates the enemy, but enslaves it with
indemnities. Once slavery had been established and had proved
profitable, it was extended by condemning to it defaulting debtors and
obstinate criminals, and by raids undertaken specifically to capture
slaves. War helped to make slavery, and slavery helped to make war.</p>
<p>Probably it was through centuries of slavery that our race
acquired</p>
<p>its traditions and habits of toil. No one would do any hard or
persistent work if he could avoid it without physical, economic or
social penalty. Slavery became part of the discipline by which man was
prepared for industry. Indirectly it furthered civilization, in so far
as it increased</p>
<p>wealth and — for a minority — created leisure. After some centuries
men took it for granted; Aristotle argued for slavery as natural and
inevitable, and St. Paul gave his benediction to what must have seemed,
by his time, a divinely ordained institution.</p>
<p>Gradually, through agriculture and slavery, through the division
of</p>
<p>labor and the inherent diversity of men, the comparative equality of
natural society was replaced by inequality and class divisions. “In the
primitive group we find as a rule no distinction between slave and free,
no serfdom, no caste, and little if any distinction between chief and
followers .” 45 Slowly the increasing complexity of tools and trades sub
- jected the unskilled or weak to the skilled or strong; every invention
was a new weapon in the hands of the strong, and further strengthened
them in their mastery and use of the weak.* Inheritance added superior
oppor- tunity to superior possessions, and stratified once homogeneous
societies into a maze of classes and castes. Rich and poor became
disruptively conscious of wealth and poverty; the class war began to run
as a red thread through all history; and the state arose as an
indispensable instru- ment for the regulation of classes, the protection
of property, the waging of war, and the organization of peace.</p>
<ul>
<li>So in our time that Mississippi of inventions which we call the
Industrial Revolution has enormously intensified the natural inequality
of men.</li>
