<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church</p>
<p>1300-1517</p>
<p>I. THE SERVICES OF CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>R ELIGION is the last subject that the intellect begins to
understand. In our youth we may have resented, with proud superiority,
its cherished incredibilities; in our less confident years we marvel at
its prosperous sur- vival in a secular and scientific age, its patient
resurrections after whatever deadly blows by Epicurus, or Lucretius, or
Lucian, or Machiaveili, or Hume, or Voltaire. What are the secrets of
this resilience?</p>
<p>The wisest sage would need the perspective of a hundred lives to
answer adequately. He might begin by recognizing that even in the heyday
of science there are innumerable phenomena for which no explanation
seems forthcoming in terms of natural cause, quantitative measurement,
and neces- sary effect. The mystery of mind still eludes the formulas of
psychology, and in physics the same astonishing order of nature that
makes science pos- sible may reasonably sustain the religious faith in a
cosmic intelligence. Our knowledge is a receding mirage in an expanding
desert of ignorance. Now life is rarely agnostic; it assumes either a
natural or a supernatural source for any unexplained phenomenon, and
acts on the one assumption or the other; only a small minority of minds
can persistently suspend judgment in the face of contradictory evidence.
The great majority of mankind feel com- pelled to ascribe mysterious
entities or events to supernatural beings raised above “natural law.”
Religion has been the worship of supernatural beings — their
propitiation, solicitation, or adoration. Most men are harassed and
buffeted by life, and crave supernatural assistance when natural forces
fail them; they gratefully accept faiths that give dignity and hope to
their exist- ence, and order and meaning to the world; they could hardly
condone so patiently the careless brutalities of nature, the bloodshed
and chicaneries of history, or their own tribulations and bereavements,
if they could not trust that these are parts of an inscrutable but
divine design. A cosmos without known cause or fate is an intellectual
prison; we long to believe that the great drama has a just author and a
noble end.</p>
<p>Moreover, we covet survival, and find it hard to conceive that nature
should so laboriously produce man, mind, and devotion only to snuff
them</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>out in the maturity of their development. Science gives man ever
greater powers but ever less significance; it improves his tools and
neglects his pur- poses; it is silent on ultimate origins, values, and
aims; it gives life and history no meaning or worth that is not canceled
by death or omnivorous time. So men prefer the assurance of dogma to the
diffidence of reason; weary of perplexed thought and uncertain judgment,
they welcome the guidance of an authoritative church, the catharsis of
the confessional, the stability of a long-established creed. Ashamed of
failure, bereaved of those they loved, darkened with sin, and fearful of
death, they feel themselves redeemed by divine aid, cleansed of guilt
and terror, solaced and inspired with hope, and raised to a godlike and
immortal destiny.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, religion brings subtle and pervasive gifts to society and
the state. Traditional rituals soothe the spirit and bind the
generations. The parish church becomes a collective home, weaving
individuals into a com- munity. The cathedral rises as the product and
pride of the unified munic- ipality. Life is embellished with sacred
art, and religious music pours its mollifying harmony into the soul and
the group. To a moral code uncon- genial to our nature and yet
indispensable to civilization, religion offers supernatural sanctions
and supports: an all-seeing deity, the threat of eternal punishment, the
promise of eternal bliss, and commandments of no pre- cariously human
authority but of divine origin and imperative force. Our instincts were
formed during a thousand centuries of insecurity and the chase; they fit
us to be violent hunters and voracious polygamists rather than peaceable
citizens; their once necessary vigor exceeds present social need; they
must be checked a hundred times a day, consciously or not, to make
society and civilization possible. Families and states, from ages be-
fore history, have enlisted the aid of religion to moderate the
barbarous impulses of men. Parents found religion helpful in taming the
willful child to modesty and self-restraint; educators valued it as a
precious means of disciplining and refining youth; governments long
since sought its co-opera- tion in forging social order out of the
disruptive egoism and natural anarchism of men. If religion had not
existed, the great legislators — Hammurabi, Moses, Lycurgus, Numa
Pompilius — would have invented it. They did not have to, for it arises
spontaneously and repeatedly from the needs and hopes of men.</p>
<p>Through a formative millennium, from Constantine to Dante, the Chris-
tian Church offered the gifts of religion to men and states. It molded
the figure of Jesus into a divine embodiment of virtues by which rough
bar- barians might be shamed into civilization. It formulated a creed
that made every man’s life a part, however modest, of a sublime cosmic
dram a; it bound each individual in a momentous relation with a God Who
had created him, Who had spoken to him in sacred Scriptures, Who had
therein given him</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>a moral code. Who had descended from heaven to suffer ignominy and
death in atonement for the sins of humanity, and Who had founded the
Church as the repository of His teaching and the earthly agent of His
power. Year by year the magnificent drama grew; saints and martyrs died
for the creed, and bequeathed their example and their merits to the
faithful. A hundred forms — a hundred thousand works — of art
interpreted the drama and made it vivid even for letterless minds. Mary
the Virgin Mother became “the fairest flower of all poesy,” the form
ative model of feminine delicacy and maternal love, the recipient of the
tenderest hymns and devotions, the in- spirer of majestic architecture,
sculpture, painting, poetry, and music. An impressive ceremony raised
daily, from a million altars, the mystic and exalting solemnity of the
Mass. Confession and penance purified the contrite sinner, prayer
comforted and strengthened him, the Eucharist brought him into an
awesome intimacy with Christ, the last sacraments cleansed and anointed
him in expectation of paradise. Rarely had religion developed such
artistry in its ministrations to mankind.</p>
<p>The Church was at her best when, by the consolations of her creed,
the magic of her ritual, the nobler morality of her adherents, the
courage, zeal, and integrity of her bishops, and the superior justice of
her episcopal courts, she took the place vacated by the Roman Imperial
government as the chief source of order and peace in the Dark Ages
(approximately 524-1079 a.d.) of the Christian world. To the Church,
more than to any other institution, Europe owed the resurrection of
civilization in the West after the barbarian inundation of Italy, Gaul,
Britain, and Spain. Her monks developed waste lands, her monasteries
gave food to the poor, education to boys, lodging to travelers; her
hospitals received the sick and the destitute. Her nunneries sheltered
mateless women and directed their maternal impulses to social ends; for
centuries the nuns alone provided schooling for girls. If classic
culture was not completely lost in the illiterate flood, it was because
monks, while allowing or causing many pagan manuscripts to perish,
copied and preserved thousands of them, and kept alive the Greek and
Latin languages in which they were written; it was in ecclesiastical
libraries, at St. Gall, Fulda, Monte Cassino, and elsewhere, that the
humanists of the Renaissance found precious relics of brilliant
civilizations that had never heard the name of Christ. For a thousand
years, from Ambrose to Wolsey, it was the Church that trained Western
Europe’s teachers, scholars, judges, diplomats, and ministers of state;
the medieval state rested on the Church. When the Dark Ages ended — say
with the birth of Abelard — it was the Church that built the
universities and the Gothic cathedrals, providing homes for the
intellect, as well as for the piety, of men. Under her protection the
Scholastic philosophers renewed the ancient attempt to interpret human
life and destiny by reason. Through nine centuries almost all European
art was inspired and financed by the</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Church; and even when art took a pagan color the popes of the
Renaissance continued their patronage. Music in its higher forms was a
daughter of the Church.</p>
<p>Above all, the Church at her zenith gave to the states of Europe an
inter- national moral code and government. Just as the Latin language,
taught in the schools by the Church, served as a unifying medium for the
scholarship, literature, science, and philosophy of diverse nations, and
just as the Catholic — i.e., universal — creed and ritual gave religious
unity to a Europe not yet</p>
<p>The great dream broke on the nature of man. The administrators of the
papal judiciary proved human, biased, venal, even extortionate; and the
kings and peoples, also human, resented any supernational power. The
grow- ing wealth of France stimulated her pride of national sovereignty;
Philip IV successfully challenged the authority of Pope Boniface VIII
over the property of the French Church; th e King’s emissaries
imprisoned the aged Pontiff for three days at Anagni, and Boniface died
soon afterward (1303). In one of its basic aspects — the revolt of
secular rulers against the popes — the Reformation there and then
began.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE CHURCH AT NADIR: I307-I417</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the fourteenth century the Church suffered political hu-
miliation and moral decay. She had begun with the profound sincerity and
devotion of Peter and Paul; she had grown into a majestic system of
familial, scholastic, social, international discipline, order, and
morality; she was now degenerating into a vested interest absorbed in
self-perpetuation and finance. Philip IV secured the election of a
Frenchman to the papacy, and persuaded him to move the Holy See to
Avignon on the Rhone. For sixty-eight years the popes were so clearly
the pawns and prisoners of France that other nations gave them a rapidly
diminishing reverence and revenue. The harassed pontiffs replenished
their treasury by multiple levies upon the hierarchy, the monasteries,
and the parishes. Every ecclesiastical appointee was required</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 7</p>
<p>to remit to the papal Curia — the administrative bureaus of the
papacy — half the income of his office for the fi rst year (“annates”) ,
and thereafter annually a tenth or tithe. A new archbishop had to pay to
the pope a substantial sum for the pallium — a band of white wool that
served as the confirmation and insignia of his authority. On the death
of any cardinal, archbishop, bishop, or abbot, his personal possessions
reverted to the papacy. In the interim between the death of an
ecclesiastic and the installation of his successor, the popes received
the net revenues of the benefice, and were accused of pro- longing this
interval. Every judgment or favor obtained from the Curia expected a
gift in acknowledgment, and the judgment was sometimes dic- tated by the
gift.</p>
<p>Much of this papal taxation was a legitimate means of financing the
central administration of a Church functioning, with diminishing
success, as the moral government of European society. Some of it,
however, went to fatten ecclesiastical paunches, even to remunerate the
courtesans that crowded Avignon. William Durand, Bishop of Mende,
submitted to the Council of Vienne ( 1 3 1 1 ) a treatise containing
these words:</p>
<p>The whole Church might be reformed if the Church of Rome</p>
<p>would begin by removing evil examples from herself … by which</p>
<p>men are scandalized, and the whole people, as it were, infected. …
For in all lands . . . the Church of Rome is in ill repute, and all cry
and</p>
<p>publish it abroad that within her bosom all men, from the
greatest</p>
<p>even unto the least, have set their hearts upon covetousness. . . .
That the whole Christian folk take from the clergy pernicious
examples</p>
<p>of gluttony is clear and notorious, since the clergy feast more
luxuri- ously . . . than princes and kings. 1</p>
<p>“Wolves are in control of the Church,” cried the high Spanish prelate
Alvaro Pelay o, “and feed on the blood” of the Christian flock. 2 Edward
III of England, himself an adept in taxation, reminded Clement VI that
“the suc - cessor of the Apostles was commissioned to lead the Lord’s
sheep to pasture, not to fleece them.” 8 In Germany p apal collectors
were hunted down, im- prisoned, mutilated, strangled. In 1372 the clergy
of Cologne, Bonn, Xanten, and Mainz bound themselves by oath not to pay
the tithe levied by Greg- ory XI.</p>
<p>Amid all complaints and revolts the popes continued to assert their
abso- lute sovereignty over the kings of the earth. About 1324, under
the patronage of John XXII, Agostino Trionfo wrote a Summa de potestate
ecclesiastica in reply to attacks on the papacy by Marsilius of Padua
and William of Ock- ham. The power of the pope, said Agostino, is from
God, Whose vicegerent he is on earth; even when he is a great sinner he
must be obeyed; he may be deposed by a general council of the Church for
manifest heresy; but short of</p>
<p>8 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>this his authority is second only to God’s, and transcends that of
all earthly potentates. He may dethrone kings and emperors at will, even
over the pro- tests of their people or the electors; he may annul the
decrees of secular rulers, and may set aside the constitutions of
states. No decree of any prince is valid unless the pope gives it his
consent. The pope stands higher than the angels, and may receive equal
reverence with the Virgin and the saints. 4 Pope John accepted all this
as following logically from the generally conceded establishment of the
Church by the Son of God, and acted on it with adaman- tine
consistency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the flight of the popes from Rome, and their
subservience to France, undermined their authority and prestige. As if
to proclaim their vas- salage, the Avignon pontiffs, in a total of 1 34
nominations to the college of cardinals, named 1 1 3 Frenchmen.® The
English government fumed at the loans of the popes to the kings of
France during the Hundred Years’ W ar, and connived at the attacks of
Wyclif upon the papacy. The Imperial elec- tors in Germany repudiated
any further interference of the popes in the election of kings and
emperors. In 1372 the abbots of Cologne publicly agreed that “the
Apostolic See has fallen into such contempt that the Catho- lic faith in
these parts seems to be seriously imperiled.” 0 In Italy the Papal</p>
<p>When he died (1378) the conclave of cardinals, overwhelmingly French
but fearful of the Roman mob, chose an Italian as Pope Urban VI. Urban
was not urbane; he proved so violent of temper, and so insistent upon
reforms uncongenial to the hierarchy, that the reassembled cardinals
declared his election invalid as having been made under duress, and
proclaimed Robert of Geneva pope. Robert assumed office as Clement VII
in Avignon, while Urban persisted as pontiff in Rome. The Papal Schism
(1378-1417) so in- augurated, like so many of the forces that prepared
the Reformation, was conditioned by the rise of the national state; in
effect it was an attempt by France to retain the moral and financial aid
of the papacy in her war with England. The lead of France was followed
by Naples, Spain, and Scotland; but England, Flanders, Germany, Poland,
Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, and</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 9</p>
<p>Portugal accepted Urban, and the divided Church became the weapon and
victim of the hostile camps. Half the Christian world held the other
half to be heretical, blasphemous, and excommunicate; each side claimed
that sacra- ments administered by priests of the opposite obedience were
worthless, and that the children so baptized, the penitents so shriven,
the dying so anointed, remained in mortal sin, and were doomed to hell —
or at best to limbo — if death should supervene. Expanding Islam laughed
at disintegrating Christendom.</p>
<p>Urban’s death (1389) brought no compromise; the fourteen cardinals in
his camp chose Boniface IX, then Innocent VII, then Gregory XII, and the
divided nations prolonged the divided papacy. When Clement VII died
(1394) the Avignon cardinals named a Spanish prelate to be Benedict
XIII. He offered to resign if Gregory would follow suit, but Gregory’s
relatives, already entr enched in office, would not hear of it. Some of
Gregory’s cardi - nals abandoned him, and called for a general council.
The King of France urged Benedict to withdraw; Benedict refused; France
renounced its alle- giance to him, and adopted neutrality. While
Benedict fled to Spain his car- dinals joined with those who had left
Gregory, and together they issued a call for a council to meet at Pisa
and elect a pope acceptable to all.</p>
<p>Rebellious philosophers, almost a century before, had laid the
theoretical foundations of the “conciliar movement.” William of Ockham
protested</p>
<p>The Council of Pisa met on March 25, 1409. It summoned Benedict and
Gregory to appear before it; they ignored it; it declared them deposed,
elected a new pope, Alexander V, bade him call another council before
May 1412, and adjourned. There were now three popes instead of two.
Alexander did not help matters by dying (1410), for his cardinals named
as his successor John XXIII, the most unmanageable man to mount the
pontifical chair since the twenty-second of his name. Governing Bologna
as papal vicar, this ec- clesiastical condottiere, Baldassare Cossa, had
permitted and taxed every-</p>
<p>to THE REFORMATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>thing, including prostitution, gambling, and usury; according to his
secretary he had seduced 200 virgins, matrons, widows, and nuns. 10 But
he had money, and an army; perhaps he could conquer the Papal States
from Gregory, and so reduce him to impecunious abdication.</p>
<p>John XXIII delayed, as long as he could, the calling of the council
decreed at Pisa. When he opened it at Constance on November 5, 1414,
only a frac- tion had arrived of the three patriarchs, twenty-nine
cardinals, thirty-three archbishops, 150 bishops, 300 doctors of
theology, fourteen university dele- gates, twenty-six princes, 140
nobles, and 4,000 priests who were to make the completed council the
largest in Christian history, and the most important since the Council
of Nicaea (325) had established the trinitarian creed of the Church. On
April 6, 1 4 1 5 , the great gathering issued a proud and revolution-
ary decree:</p>
<p>This holy synod of Constance, being a general council, and
legally</p>
<p>assembled in the Holy Spirit for the praise of God, for ending
the</p>
<p>present Schism, and for the union and reform of the Church in its</p>
<p>head and members . . . ordains, declares, and decrees as follows:
First, it declares that this synod . . . represents the Church Militant,
and</p>
<p>has its authority directly from Christ; and everybody, of
whatever</p>
<p>rank or dignity, including also the pope, is bound to obey this
coun-</p>
<p>cil in those things that pertain to the faith, to the ending of
this</p>
<p>Schism, and to a general reform of the Church in its head and mem-
bers. Likewise it declares that if anyone . . . including also the
pope,</p>
<p>shall refuse to obey the commands, statutes, ordinances … of this</p>
<p>holy council … in regard to the ending of the Schism or to the
re-</p>
<p>form of the Church, he shall be subject to proper punishment . .
.</p>
<p>and, if necessary, recourse shall be had to other aids of justice.
11</p>
<p>The Council demanded the abdication of Gregory XII, Benedict XIII,
and John XXIII. Receiving no answer from John, it accepted the
presentation of fifty-four charges against him as a pagan, oppressor,
liar, simoniac, traitor, lecher, and thief; sixteen other accusations
were suppressed as too severe. 12 On May 29, 1415, it deposed him.
Gregory was more pliant and subtle; he agreed to resign, but only on
condition that he should first be allowed to reconvene the council on
his own authority. So reconvened, the council ac- cepted his resignation
(July 4). To further attest its orthodoxy, it burned at the stake (July
6) the Bohemian reformer, John Huss. On July 26 it de- clared Benedict
XIII deposed; he settled in Valencia, and died there at ninety, still
holding himself pope. On November 17, 1417, an electoral committee chose
Cardinal Ottone Colonna as Pope Martin V. All Christendom ac- knowledged
him, and the Papal Schism came to an end.</p>
<p>The victory of the council in this regard defeated its other purpose
— to re- form the Church. Martin V at once assumed all the powers and
prerogatives</p>
<p>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>of the papacy. Playing off each national group of delegates against
the others, he persuaded them to accept a vague and innocuous minimum of
reform. The council yielded to him because it was tired. On April 22,
1418, it dissolved.</p>

<p>Martin reorganized the Curia to more effective functioning, but could
find no way to finance it except by imitating the secular governments of
the age and selling offices and services. Since the Church had survived
for a cen- tury without reform, but could hardly survive a week without
money, he concluded that money was more urgently needed than reform. In
1430, a year before Martin’s death, a Ge rman envoy to Rome sent his
prince a letter that almost sounded the theme and tocsin of the
Reformation:</p>
<p>Greed reigns supreme in the Roman court, and day by day finds</p>
<p>new devices . . . for extorting money from Germany. . . . Hence</p>
<p>much outcry and heartburnings. . . . Many questions in regard to</p>
<p>the papacy will arise, or else obedience will at last be entirely

<p>nounced, to escape from these outrageous exactions by the Italians;
and this latter course, as I perceive, would be acceptable to many</p>
<p>countries. 13</p>
<p>Martin’s successor faced the accumulated problems of the Apostolic
See from the background of a devout Franciscan friar ill equipped for
statesman- ship. The papacy had to govern states as well as the Church;
the popes had to be men of affairs with at least one foot in the world,
and could rarely af- ford to be saints. Eugenius IV might have been a
saint had not his troubles embittered his spirit. In the first year of
his pontificate the Council of Basel proposed again to assert the
supremacy of general councils over the popes. It assumed one after
another traditionally papal function: it issued indul- gences and
dispensations, appointed to benefices, and required annates to be sent
to itself instead of to the pope. Eugenius ordered it to dissolve;
instead it declared him deposed, and named Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy,
as Anti- pope Felix V (1439). The Papal Schism was renewed.</p>
<p>To complete the apparent defeat of the papacy, Charles VII of France
convened an assembly of French prelates, nobles, and lawyers, which pro-
claimed the superior authority of general councils and issued the
Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438): ecclesiastical offices were
henceforth to be filled th rough election by the local clergy, but the
king might make “recom - mendations”; appeals to the papal Curia were
forbidden except after exhaust - ing all judicial avenues in France; and
annates were no longer to be sent to the pope. In effect the Sanction
established an independent Gallican Church</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>and made the king its master. A year later a diet at Mainz adopted
resolutions aiming at a similar national church in Germany. Bohemia had
already sep- arated itself from the papacy. The whole edifice of the
Roman Church seemed about to collapse.</p>
<p>Eugenius was rescued by the Turks. As the Ottomans came ever nearer
to Constantinople, the Byzantine government decided that the Greek
capital was worth a Roman Mass, and that a reunion of Greek with Latin
Christian- ity was an indispensable prelude to winning military or
financial aid from the West. Greek prelates and nobles came in
picturesque panoply to Ferrara, then to Florence, to meet the Roman
hierarchy summoned by the Pope (1438). After a year of argument an
accord was reached that recognized the authority of the Roman pontiff
over all Christendom; and on July 6, 1439, all the members of the
conference, with the Greek emperor at their head, bent the knee before
that same Eugenius who had seemed, so recently, the most despised and
rejected of men. The concord was brief, for the Greek clergy and people
repudiated it; but it restored the prestige of the papacy, and helped to
bring the new schism, and the Council of Basel, to an end.</p>
<p>A succession of strong popes, enriched and exalted by the Italian
Renais- sance, now raised the papacy to such splendor as it had not
known even in the proud days of Innocent III. Nicholas V earned the
admiration of the humanists by devoting Church revenues to the patronage
of scholarship and art. Calixtus III established that genial custom of
nepotism — giving offices to relatives — which became a pillar of
corruption in the Church. Pius II, brilliant as author and barren as
pope, struggled to reform the Curia and the monas- teries. He appointed
a commission of prelates reputed for integrity and piety to study the
shortcomings of the Church, and to this commission he made a frank
confession:</p>
<p>Two things are particularly near my heart: the war with the Turks</p>
<p>and the reform of the Roman court. The amendment of the whole</p>
<p>state of ecclesiastical affairs, which I have determined to
undertake, depends upon this court as its model. I purpose to begin by
improv- ing the morals of ecclesiastics here, and banishing all simony
and</p>
<p>other abuses. 14</p>
<p>The committee made laudable recommendations, and Pius embodied them
in a bull. But hardly anybody in Rome wanted reform; every second
function- ary or dignitary there profited from some form of venality.
Apathy and passive resistance defeated Pius, while the abortive crusade
that he under- took against the Turks absorbed his energy and his funds.
Toward the end of his pontificate he addressed a final appeal to the
cardinals:</p>
<p>People say that we live for pleasure, accumulate wealth, bear
our-</p>
<p>selves arrogantly, ride on fat mules and handsome palfreys . . .
keep</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 13</p>
<p>hounds for the chase, spend much on actors and parasites and nothing
in defense of the faith. And there is some truth in their words: many
among the cardinals and other officials of our court do lead this kind
of life. If the truth be confessed, the luxury and pomp of our court</p>
<p>is too great. And this is why we are so detested by the people that
they will not listen to us, even when we say what is just and
reasonable.</p>
<p>What do you think is to be done in such a shameful state of
things?</p>
<p>. . . We must inquire by what means our predecessors won authority
and consideration for the Church. . . . We must maintain that author-
ity by the same means. Temperance, chastity, innocence, zeal for the
faith . . . contempt of earth, the desire for martyrdom exalted the Ro-
man Church, and made her the mistress of the world. 16</p>
<p>Despite the labors of popes like Nicholas V and Pius II, and of
sincere and accomplished ecclesiastics like Cardinals Giuliano Cesarini
and Nicholas of Cusa, the faults of the papal court mounted as the
fifteenth century neared its end. 16 Paul II wore a papal tiara that
outweighed a palace in its worth. Sixtus IV made his nephew a
millionaire, entered avidly into the game of politics, blessed the
cannon that fought his battles, and financed his wars by selling church
offices to the highest bidders. Innocent VIII celebrated in the Vatican
the marriages of his children. Alexander VI, like Luther and Calvin,
thought clerical celibacy a mistake, and begot five or more children
before subsiding into reasonable continence as a pope. His gay virility
did not stick so sharply in the gullet of the time as we might suppose;
a certain clandestine amorousness was then accepted as usual in the
clergy; what offended Europe was t hat Alexander’s unscrupulous
diplomacy, and the ruthless generalship of his son Caesar Borgia, rewon
the Papal States for the papacy and added needed revenues and strength
to the Apostolic See. In these policies and campaigns the Borgias used
all those methods of stratagem and death which were soon to be
formulated in Machiavelli’s Prince (1513) as indispensable to founding a
powerful state or a united Italy. Pope Julius II out-Caesared Borgia in
waging war against rapacious Venice and the invading French; he escaped
whenever he could from the prison of the Vatican, led his army in
person, and relished the rough life and speech of martial camps. Europe
was shocked to see the papacy not only secularized but militarized; yet
it could hardly withhold some admiration from a mighty warrior miscast
as a pope; and some word went over the Alps about the services of Julius
to art in his discriminating patronage of Raphael and Michelangelo. It
was Julius who began the building of the new St. Peter’s, and first
granted indulgences to those who contributed to its cost. It was in his
pontificate that Luther came to Rome and saw for himself that “sink of
iniquity” which had been Lorenzo de’ Medici’s name for the capital of
Christendom. No ruler in Europe could any longer think of the papacy as
a moral supergovemment binding all the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>nations into a Christian commonwealth; the papacy itself, as a
secular state, had become nationalistic; all Europe, as the old faith
waned, fell into national fragments acknowledging no supernational or
international moral law, and doomed to five centuries of interchristian
wars.</p>
<p>To judge these Renaissance popes fairly we must see them against the
background of their time. Northern Europe could feel their faults, since
it financed them; but only those who knew the exuberant Italy of the
period between Nicholas V (1447-55) and Leo X (15 13-21) could view them
with understanding lenience. Though several of them were personally
pious, most of them accepted the Renaissance conviction that the world,
while still for so many a vale of tears and devilish snares, could also
be a scene of beauty, intense living, and fleeting happiness; it did not
seem scandalous to them that they enjoyed life and the papacy.</p>
<p>They had their virtues. They labored to redeem Rome from the ugliness
and squalor into which it had fallen while the popes were at Avignon.
They drained marshes (by comfortable proxy), paved streets, restored
bridges and roads, improved the water supply, established the Vatican
Library and the Capitoline Museum, enlarged the hospitals, distributed
charity, built or repaired churches, embellished the city with palaces
and gardens, reorgan- ized the University of Rome, supported the
humanists in resurrecting pagan literature, philosophy, and art, and
gave employment to painters, sculptors, and architects whose works are
now a treasured heritage of all mankind. They squandered millions; they
used millions constructively. They spent too much on the new
St. Peter’s, but hardly more in proportion than the kings of France
would spend on Fontainebleau and Versailles and the chateaux of the
Loire; and perhaps they thought of it as transforming scattered crumbs
of evanescent wealth into a lasting splendor for the people and their
God. Most of these popes in private lived simply, some (like Alexander
VI) ab- stemiously, and resigned themselves to pomp and luxury only as
required by public taste and discipline. They raised the papacy, which
had so lately been scorned and destitute, to an impressive majesty of
power.</p>

<li>THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>But while the Church seemed to be growing again in grandeur and
author- ity, Europe was undergoing economic, political, and intellectual
changes that slowly undermined the structure of Latin Christianity.</p>
<p>Religion normally thrives in an agricultural regime, science in an
industrial economy. Every harvest is a miracle of the earth and a whim
of the sky; the humble peasant, subject to weather and consumed with
toil, sees supernatural forces everywhere, prays for a propitious
heaven, and accepts a feudal-reli-</p>
<p>CHAP. 1 ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 15</p>
<p>gious system of graduated loyalties mounting through vassal, liege
lord, and king to God. The city worker, the merchant, the manufacturer,
the finan- cier, live in a mathematical world of calculated quantities
and processes, of material causes and regular effects; the machine and
the counting table dis- pose them to see, over widening areas, the reign
of “natural law.” The growth of industry, commerce, and finance in the
fifteenth century, the passage of labor from the countryside to the
town, the rise of the mercantile class, the expansion of local to
national to international economy — all were of evil omen for a faith
that had fitted in so well with feudalism and the somber vicissitudes of
the fields. Businessmen repudiated ecclesiastical re- straints as well
as feudal tolls; the Church had to yield, by transparent theo- logical
jugglery, to the necessity of charging interest for loans if capital was
to expand enterprise and industry; by 1 500 the old prohibition of
“usury” was universally ignored. Lawyers and businessmen more and more
replaced churchmen and nobles in the administration of government. Law
itself, triumphantly recapturing its Roman Imperial traditions and
prestige, led the march of secularization and day by day encroached on
the sphere of ecclesi- astical regulation of life by canon law. Secular
courts extended their juris- diction; episcopal courts declined.</p>
<p>The adolescent monarchies, enriched by revenues from commerce and
industry, freed themselves day by day from domination by the Church. The
kings resented the residence, in their realms, of papal legates or
nuncios who acknowledged no authority but the pope’s, and made each
nation’s church a state within the state. In England the statutes of
Provisors (1351) and Prae- munire (1353) sharply restricted the economic
and judicial powers of the clergy. In France the Pragmatic Sanction of
Bourges was theoretically abro- gated in 15 16, but the king retained
the right to nominate archbishops, bish- ops, abbots, and priors. 17 The
Venetian Senate insisted on appointing to high ecclesiastical office in
all Venetian dependencies. Ferdinand and Isabella overrode the popes in
filling many ecclesiastical vacancies in Spain. In the Holy Roman
Empire, where Gregory VII had maintained against Henry IV the papal
right of investiture, Sixtus IV conceded to the emperors the right of
nomination to 300 benefices and seven bishoprics. The kings often
misused these powers by giving church offices to political favorites,
who took the revenues — but ignored the responsibilities — of their
abbacies and sees. 18 Many ecclesiastical abuses were traceable to such
secular appointees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the intellectual environment of the Church was changing, to
her peril. She still produced laborious and conscientious scholars; but
the schools and universities that she had founded had raised up an
educated minority whose thinking did not always please the saints. Hear
St. Bernar- dino, toward 14.20:</p>
<p>1 6 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>V ery many folk, considering the wicked life of monks and friars,</p>
<p>nuns and secular clergy, are shaken by this; nay, oftentimes, they
fail in faith, and believe in nothing higher than the roofs of their
houses, not esteeming those things to be true that have been written
concern- ing our faith, but believing them to have been written by the
cozening invention of men, and not by God’s inspiration. . . . They
despise the sacraments . . . and hold that the soul has no existence;
neither do</p>
<p>they . . . fear hell nor desire heaven, but cling with all their
hearts to transitory things, and resolve that this world shall be their
paradise. 19</p>
<p>Probably the business class was the least pious; as wealth mounts,
religion declines. Gower (i325?-i4o8) claimed that the merchants of
England cared little about the hereafter, saying, “He who can get the
sweetness of this life, and lets it go, would be a fool, for no man
knoweth whither or by what way we go” aft er death. 20 The failure of
the Crusades had left a slowly fading wonder why the God of Christendom
had permitted the victory of Islam, and the capture of Constantinople by
the Turks refreshed these doubts. The work of Nicholas of Cusa (1432)
and Lorenzo Valla (1439), in exposing the “Donation of Constantine” as a
forgery, damaged the prestige of the Church and weakened her title to
temporal power. The recovery and pub- lication of classical texts
nourished skepticism by revealing a world of learn- ing and art that had
flourished long before the birth of that Christian Church which, at the
Fifth Council of the Lateran ( 1 5 1 2-1 7 ) , had denied the possi-
bility of salvation outside her fold: nulla salus extra ecclesiam . 21
The dis - covery of America, and the widening exploration of the East,
revealed a hundred nations that with apparent impunity ignored or
rejected Christ, and had faiths of their own as positive, and as morally
efficacious, as Chris- tianity. Travelers returning f rom “heathen”
lands brought some rubbing of strange creeds and rituals with them;
these alien cults touched elbows with Christian worship and belief, and
rival dogmas suffered attrition in the mar- ket place and the port.</p>
<p>Philosophy, which in the thirteenth century had been the handmaid of
theology, devoting itself to finding rational grounds for the orthodox
faith, liberated itself in the fourteenth century with William of Ockham
and Marsilius of Padua, and in the sixteenth became boldly secular,
flagrantly skeptical with Pomponazzi, Machiavelli, and Guicciardini.
Some four years before Luther’s Theses Machiavelli wrote a startling
prophecy:</p>
<p>Had the religion of Christianity been preserved according to the</p>
<p>ordinances of the Founder, the state and commonwealth of Christen-
dom would have been far more united and happy than they are. Nor can
there be a greater proof of its decadence than the fact that the</p>
<p>nearer people are to the Roman Church, the head of their
religion,</p>
<p>the less religious are they. And whoever examines the principles
on</p>
<p>CHAP; i) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 17</p>
<p>which that religion is founded, and sees how widely different
from</p>
<p>those principles its present practice and application are, will
judge</p>
<p>that her ruin or chastisement is near at hand. 22</p>
<p>V. THE CASE AGAINST THE CHURCH</p>
<p>Shall we recapitulate the charges made by loyal Catholics against the
Church of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries? The first and sorest
was that she loved money, and had too much of it for her own good.* In
the Centum Gravamina, or Hundred Grievances, listed against the Church
by the Diet of Nuremberg ( 1 5 2 2 ) , it was alleged that she owned
half the wealth of Germany. 28 A Catholic historian reckoned the Chur
ch’s share as a third in Germany and a fifth in France ; 2i but a
procurer-general of the Parlement calculated in 1 502 that three
quarters of all French wealth was ecclesias- tical. 25 No statistics are
available to check these estimates. In Italy, of course, one third of
the peninsula belonged to the Church as the Papal States, and she owned
rich properties in the rest.t</p>
<p>Six factors served to accumulate lands in the possession of the
Church. ( 1 ) Most of those who bequeathed property left somethi ng to
her as “fire in - surance”; and as the Church controlled the making and
probating of wills, her agents were in a position to encourage such
legacies. (2) Since ecclesias- tical property was safer than other
property from ravage by bandits, soldiers, or governments, some persons,
for security, deeded their lands to the Church, held them as her
vassals, and surrendered all right to them at death. Others willed part
or all of their property to the Church on condition that she should
provide for them in sickness or old age; in this way the Church of-
fered disability insurance. (3) Crusaders had sold — or mortgaged and
for- feited — lands to ecclesiastical bodies to raise cash for their
venture. (4) Hundreds of thousands of acres had been earned for the
Church by the rec- lamation work of monastic orders. (5) Land once
acquired by the Church was inalienable — could not be sold or given away
by any of her personnel ex- cept through discouragingly complex means.
(6) Church property was nor- mally free from taxation by the state;
occasionally, however, kings reckless of</p>

<p>t In any society the majority of abilities is contained in a minority
of men; therefore, sooner or later, the majority of goods, privileges,
and powers will be possessed by a minority of men. Wealth became
concentrated in the Church in the Middle Ages because she served vital
func- tions and was herself served by the ablest men. The Reformation,
in one aspect, was a redis- tribution of this naturally concentrated
wealth by the secular appropriation of ecclesiastical property or
revenues.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>damnation forced levies from the clergy, or found legal dodges to
confiscate some portion of ecclesiastical wealth. The rulers of northern
Europe might have grumbled less about the riches of the Church if the
income therefrom, or the multifarious contributions of the faithful, had
remained within the national boundaries; they fretted at the sight of
northern gold flowing in a thousand streamlets to Rome.</p>
<p>The Church, however, looked upon herself as the chief agent in
maintain- ing morality, social order, education, literature,
scholarship, and art; the state relied upon her to fulfill these
functions; to perform them she needed an extensive and expensive
organization; to finance this she taxed and gath- ered fees; even a
church could not be governed by paternosters. Many bishops were the
civil as well as the ecclesiastical rulers of their regions; most of
them were appointed by lay authorities, and came of patrician stock ac-
customed to easy morals and luxuries; they taxed and spent like princes;
sometimes, in the performance of their multiple functions, they
scandalized the saints by donning armor and lustily leading their troops
in war. Cardinals were chosen rarely for their piety, usually for their
wealth or political con- nections or administrative capacity; they
looked upon themselves, not as monks burdened with vows, but as the
senators and diplomats of a rich and powerful state; in many instances
they were not priests; and they did not let their red hats impede their
enjoyment of life . 26 The Church forgot the poverty of the Apostles in
the needs and expenses of power.</p>
<p>Being worldly, the servants of the Church were often as venal as the
officials of contemporary governments. Corruption was in the mores of
the time and in the nature of man; secular courts were notoriously
amenable to the persuasiveness of money, and no papal election could
rival in bribery the election of Charles V as emperor. This excepted,
the fattest bribes in Europe were paid at the Roman court . 27
Reasonable fees had been fixed for the serv- ices of the Curia, but the
cupidity of the staff raised the actual cost to twenty times the legal
sum . 28 Dispensations could be had from almost any canonical
impediment, almost any sin, provided the inducement was adequate. Aeneas
Sylvius, before becoming pope, wrote that everything was for sale in
Rome, and that nothing could be had there without money . 29 A
generation later the monk Savonarola, with the exaggeration of
indignation, called the Church of Rome a “harlot” ready to sell her
favors for coin . 30 Another genera - tion later, Erasmus remarked: “The
shamelessness of the Roman Curia has reached its climax.” 81 Pastor
writes:</p>
<p>A deep-rooted corruption had taken possession of nearly all the</p>
<p>officials of the Curia. . . . The inordinate number of gratuities
and</p>
<p>exactions passed all bounds. Moreover, on all sides deeds were
dishon- estly manipulated, and even falsified, bv the officials. No
wonder that</p>
<p>CHAP, i) the roman catholic church 19</p>
<p>there arose from all parts of Christendom the loudest complaints</p>
<p>about the corruption and financial extortions of the papal officials.
32</p>
<p>It was unusual for impecunious merit to mount in the Church of the
fif- teenth century. From the moderate fee charged for priestly
ordination to the enormous sums that many cardinals paid for their
elevation, nearly every appointment required the clandestine lubrication
of superiors. A favorite papal device for raising funds was to sell
ecclesiastical offices, or (as the popes saw the matter) to appoint to
sinecures or honors, even to the cardinalate, persons who would make a
substantial contribution to the expenses of the Church. Alexander VI
created eighty new offices, and received 760 ducats (9,000?) from each
of the appointees. Julius II formed a “college” or bureau of 101
secretaries, who together paid him 74,000 ducats for the privi- lege.
Leo X nominated sixty chamberlains and 141 squires to the papal house-
hold, and received from them 202,000 ducats. 83 The salaries paid to
such officials were looked upon, by giver and recipient, as endowment
policy an- nuities; but to Luther they seemed the rankest simony.</p>
<p>In thousands of cases the appointee lived far away from the benefice
— the parish or abbacy or episcopacy — whose revenues supported his
labor or lux- ury; and one man might be the absentee beneficiary of
several such posts. So the active Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Alexander VI
to be) received from a variety of benefices an income of 70,000 ducats
(,750,000? ) a year; and his furious foe, Cardinal della Rovere (later
Julius II), held at one time the archbishopric of Avignon, the
bishoprics of Bologna, Lausanne, Coutances, Viviers, Mende, Ostia, and
Velletri, and the abbacies of Nonantola and Grottaferrata. 84 By this
“pluralism” the Church maintained her major ex - ecutives, and, in many
instances, scholars, poets, and scientists. So Petrarch, sharp critic of
the Avignon popes, lived on the sinecures that they granted him;
Erasmus, who satirized a hundred ecclesiastical follies, regularly re-
ceived Church pensions; and Copernicus, who did most damage to medieval
Christianity, lived for years on Church benefices involving a minimum of
distraction from his scientific pursuits. 85</p>
<p>A more serious charge than pluralism was laid against the personal
moral- ity of the clergy. “The morals of the clergy are corrupt,” said
the Bishop of Torcello ( 1458); “they have become an offense to the
laity.” 86 Of the four orders of friars founded in the thirteenth
century — Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, Augustinians — all but
the last had become scandalously lax in piety and discipline. The
monastic rules formulated in the fervor of early devotion proved too
rigorous for a human nature increasingly freed from supernatural fears.
Absolved by their collective wealth from the necessity of manual labor,
thousands of monks and friars neglected, religious services,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>wandered outside their walls, drank in taverns, and pursued amours.
37 A fourteenth-century Dominican, John Bromyard, said of his fellow
friars:</p>
<p>Those who should be the fathers of the poor . . . covet delicate food
and enjoy morning sleep. . . . Very few vouchsafe their presence at</p>
<p>matins or Mass. . . . They are consumed in gluttony and drunken-</p>
<p>ness . . . not to say in uncleanliness, so that now the assemblies of
cler- ics are thought to be brothels of wanton folk and congregations
of</p>
<p>play-actors. 88</p>
<p>Erasmus repeated the charge after a century: “Many convents of men
and women differ little from public brothels.” 89 Petrarch drew a
favorable pic- ture of discipline and devotion in the Carthusian
monastery where his brother lived, and several convents in Holland and
Western Germany re- tained the spirit of study and piety that had formed
the Brethren of the Common Life and produced The Imitation of Christ .
10 Yet Johannes Trithe- mius, Abbot of Sponheim (c. 1490), denounced the
monks of this Rhenish Germany with violent hyperbole:</p>
<p>The three vows of religion … are as little heeded by these men as</p>
<p>if they had never promised to keep them. . . . The whole day is spent
in filthy talk; their whole time is given to play and gluttony. … In</p>
<p>open possession of private property . . . each dwells in his own
private lodging. . . . They never fear nor love God; they have no
thought of</p>
<p>the life to come, preferring their fleshly lusts to the needs of the
soul.</p>
<p>. . . They scorn the vow of poverty, know not that of chastity,
revile</p>
<p>that of obedience. . . . The smoke of their filth ascends all around.
41 Guy Jouenneaux, a papal commissary sent to reform the Benedictine
mon- asteries of France, turned in a gloomy report ( 1 503 ) : Many
monks gamble, curse, haunt inns, carry swords, gather riches, fornicate,
“live the life of Bacchanals,” and “are more worldly than the mere
worldling. … Were I minded to relate all those things that have come
under my own eyes, I should make too long a tale of it.” 42 In the
growing disorder of the monasteries a great number of them neglected
those admirable works of charity, hospi- tality, and education which had
entitled them to public trust and support. 43 Said Pope Leo X ( 1 5 1 6)
: “The lack of rule in the monasteries of France and the immodest life
of the monks have come to such a pitch that neither kings, princes, nor
the faithful at large have any respect left for them.” 44 A recent</p>
<p>Read the innumerable testimonies of this time — historical anec-</p>
<p>dotes, rebukes of moralists, satires of scholars and poets, papal
bulls, synodal constitutions — what do they say? Always the same facts
and die same complaints: the suppression of conventual life, of

<p>pline, of morals. . . . Prodigious is the number of monastic
robbers</p>
<p>and debauchees; to realize their disorders we must read the details
re- vealed by judicial inquiry as to the internal state of the majority
of</p>
<p>the great abbeys. . . . The abuses among the Carthusians were so
great that the order was in ill repute almost everywhere. . . . Monastic
life had disappeared from the nunneries. . . . All contributed to
transform these asylums of prayer into centers of dissipation and
disorder. 45</p>
<p>The secular clergy, if we take a lenient attitude toward concubinage,
pre- sent a better picture than the friars and monks. The chief sin of
the simple parish priest was his ignorance, 46 but he was too poorly
paid and hard worked to have funds or time for study, and the piety of
the people suggests that he was often respected and loved. Violations of
the sacerdotal vow of chastity were frequent. In Norfolk, England, out
of seventy-three accusations of incontinence filed in 1499, fifteen were
against clergymen; in Ripon, out of 126, twenty-four; in Lambeth, out of
fifty-eight, nine; i.e., clerical offenders numbered some 23 per cent of
the total, though the clergy were probably less than 2 per cent of the
population. 47 Some confessors solicited sexual favors from female
penitents. 48 Thousands of priests had concubines; in Ger- many nearly
all. 49 In Rome it was assumed that priests kept concubines; and some
reports estimated the prostitutes there ac 6,000 in a population not ex-
ceeding ioo,ooo. 50 To quote again a Catholic historian:</p>
<p>It is not surprising, when the highest ranks of the clergy were
in</p>
<p>such a state, that among the regular orders and secular priests

<p>and irregularities of all sorts should become more and more
common.</p>
<p>The salt of the earth had lost its savor But it is a mistake to
suppose</p>
<p>that the corruption of the clergy was worse in Rome than elsewhere;
there is documentary evidence of the immorality of the priests in al-
most every town in the Italian peninsula No wonder, as contem-</p>
<p>porary writers sadly testify, the influence of the clergy had
declined, and in many places hardly any respect was shown for the
priest-</p>
<p>hood. Their immorality was so gross that suggestions in favor of
al-</p>
<p>lowing priests to marry began to be heard. 51</p>
<p>In fairness to these lusty priests we should consider that sacerdotal
con- cubinage was not profligacy, but an almost universal rebellion
against the rule of celibacy that had been imposed upon an unwilling
clergy by Pope Gregory VII (1074) . Just as the Greek and Russian
Orthodox Church, after the schism of 1054, had continued to permit
marriage to its priests, so the clergy of the Roman Church demanded the
same right; and since the canon law of their Church refused this, they
took concubines. Bishop Hardouin of Angers reported (1428) that the
clergy of his diocese did not count con- cubinage a sin, and that they
made no attempt to disguise their use of it. 52 In Pomerania, about
1500, such unions were recognized by the people as</p>
<p>22 THE REFORMATION (CHAP, I</p>
<p>reasonable, and were encouraged by them as protection for their
daughters and wives; at public festivals the place of honor was given as
a matter of course to priests and their consorts. 68 In Schleswig a
bishop who tried to outlaw the practice was driven from his see (1499).
64 At the Council of Constance Cardinal Zabarella proposed that if
sacerdotal concubinage could not be suppressed, clerical marriage should
be restored. The Emperor Sigis- mund, in a message to the Council of
Basel ( 143 1 ), argued that the marriage of the clergy would improve
public morals. 66 Aeneas Sylvius was quoted by the contemporary
historian Platina, librarian of the Vatican, as saying that there were
good reasons for clerical celibacy, but better reasons against it. 66
The moral record of the pre-Reformation priesthood stands in a better
light if we view sacerdotal concubinage as a forgivable revolt against
an arduous rule unknown to the Apostles and to the Christianity of the
East.</p>
<p>The complaint that finally sparked the Reformation was the sale of
in- dulgences. Through the powers apparently delegated by Christ to
Peter (Matt. 1 6 : 1 9) , by Peter to bishops, and by bishops to
priests, the clergy were authorized to absolve a confessing penitent
from the guilt of his sins and from their punishment in hell, but not
from doing penance for them on earth. Now only a few men, however
thoroughly shriven, could rely on dy- ing with all due penances
performed; the balance would have to be paid for by years of suffering
in purgatory, which a merciful God had established as a temporary hell.
On the other hand, many saints, by their devotion and martyrdom, had
earned merits probably in excess of the penances due to their sins;
Christ by his death had added an infinity of merits; these merits, said
the theory of the Church, could be conceived as a treasury on which the
pope might draw to cancel part or all of the temporal penalties incurred
and unperformed by absolved penitents. Usually the penances prescribed
by the Church had taken the form of repeating prayers, giving alms,
making a pilgrimage to some sacred shrine, joining a crusade against
Turks or other infidels, or donating money or labor to social projects
like draining a swamp, building a road, bridge, hospital, or church. The
substitution of a money fine (Wehrgeld) for punishment was a
long-established custom in secular courts; hence no furore was caused by
the early application of the idea to indulgences. A shriven penitent, by
paying such a fine — i.e., making a money contribution — to the expenses
of the Church, would receive a partial or plenary indulgence, not to
commit further sins, but to escape a day, a month, a year in purgatory,
or all the time he might have had to suffer there to complete his
penance for his sins. An indulgence did not cancel the guilt of sins;
this, when the priest absolved a contrite penitent, was forgiven in the
confessional. An indulgence, therefore, was the remission, by the
Church, of part or all of the temporal (i.e., not eternal) penalties
incurred by sins whose guilt had been forgiven in the sacrament of
penance.</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 23</p>
<p>This ingenious and complicated theory was soon transformed by the
sim- plicity of the people, and by the greed of the quaestiarii , or
“pardoners,” commissioned or presuming to distribute the indulgences. As
these purveyors were allowed to retain a percentage of the receipts,
some of them omitted to insist on repentance, confession, and prayer,
and left the recipient free to interpret the indulgence as dispensing
him from repentance, confession, and absolution, and as depending almost
entirely upon the money contribution. About 1450 Thomas Gascoigne,
Chancellor of Oxford University, com- plained that</p>
<p>sinners say nowadays: “I care not how many evils I do in God’s</p>
<p>sight, for I can easily get plenary remission of all guilt and
penalty</p>
<p>by an absolution and indulgence granted me by the pope, whose</p>
<p>written grant I have bought for four or six pence, or have won as
a</p>
<p>stake for a game of tennis 〔with the pardoner〕.” For these indul
-</p>
<p>gence-mongers wander over the country, and give a letter of pardon,
sometimes for two pence, sometimes for a draught of wine or beer</p>
<p>… or even for the hire of a harlot, or for carnal love. 57</p>
<p>The popes — Boniface IX in 1392, Martin V in 1420, Sixtus IV in 1478
— repeatedly condemned these misconceptions and abuses, but they were
too pressed for revenue to practice effective control. They issued bulls
so fre- quently, and for so confusing a variety of causes, that men of
education lost faith in the theory, and accused the Church of
shamelessly exploiting human credulity and hope. 58 In some cases, as in
the indulgences offered by Julius II in 1 5 10 or by Leo X in 1 5 1 3,
the official wording lent itself to the purely monetary interpretation.
59 A Franciscan friar of high rank described with anger how chests were
placed in all the churches of Germany to receive payments by those who,
having been unable to go to Rome for the jubilee of 1450, could now
obtain the same plenary indulgence by money dropped in the box; and he
warned the Germans, a half-century before Luther, that by indulgences
and other means their savings were being drained off to Rome. 60 Even
the clergy complained that indulgences were snaring into papal coffers
contributions that might otherwise have been secured for local
ecclesiastical uses.® 1 Again a Catholic historian sums up the matter
with ad- mirable candor:</p>
<p>Nearly all abuses connected with indulgences rose from this, that</p>
<p>the faithful, after frequenting the sacrament of penance as the
recog- nized condition for gaining the indulgence, found themselves
called on to make an offering of money in proportion to their means.
This of-</p>
<p>fering for good works, which should have been only accessory, was in
certain cases made into the chief condition. . . . The need of money,
instead of the good of souls, became only too often the end of the i
-</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>dulgence. . . . Though in the wording of the bulls the doctrine of
the Church was never departed from, and confession, contrition, and def-
initely prescribed good works were made the condition for g aining</p>
<p>the indulgence, still the financial side of the matter was always
appar- ent, and the necessity for making offerings of money was placed
most scandalously in the foreground. Indulgences took more and more the
form of a monetary arrangement, which led to many conflicts with</p>
<p>the secular powers, who were always demanding a share of the pro-
ceeds. 62</p>
<p>Almost as mercenary as the sale of indulgences was the acceptance or
so- licitation, by the clergy, of money payments, grants, legacies, for
the saying of Masses supposed to reduce a dead soul’s term of punishment
in purgatory. Large sums were devoted to this purpose by pious people,
either to relieve a departed relative or friend, or to shorten or annul
their own purgatorial probation after death. The poor complained that
through their inability to pay for Masses and indulgences it was the
earthly rich, not the meek, who would inherit the kingdom of heaven; and
Columbus ruefully praised money because, he said, “he who possesses it
has the power of transporting souls into paradise.” 63</p>
<p>A thousand other grievances swelled the case against the Church. Many
of the laity resented the exemption of the clergy from the laws of the
state, and the dangerous lenience of ecclesiastical courts to
ecclesiastical offenders. The Nuremberg Diet of 1522 declared that no
justice could be had by a lay plaintiff against a clerical defendant
before a spiritual tribunal, and warned that unless the clergy were
subjected to secular courts there would be an uprising against the
Church in Germany; 64 the uprising, of course, had then already begun.
Further complaints alleged the divorce of religion from mo- rality, the
emphasis laid on orthodox belief rather than on good conduct (though the
Reformers were to be in this particular greater sinners than the
Church), the absorption of religion in ritual, the useless idleness and
presumed sterility of monks, the exploitation of popular credulity
through bogus relics and miracles, the abuse of excommunication and
interdict, the censorship of publications by the clergy, the espionage
and cruelty of the Inquisition, the misuse, for other purposes, of funds
contributed for crusades against the Turks, and the claim of a
deteriorated clergy to be the sole administrators of every sacrament
except baptism.</p>
<p>All the foregoing factors entered into the anticlericalism of Roman
Catho- lic Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century. “The
contempt and hatred of the laity for the degenerate clergy,” says
Pastor, “was no mean factor in the great apostasy.” 85 A London bishop
complained in 1515 that the people “be so maliciously set in favor of
heretical pravity that they will . . . condemn any cleric, though he
were as innocent as Abel.” 66 Among lay -</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 2 , Erasmus reported, the title of
clerk or priest or monk was a term of bitter insult. 67 In Vienna the
priesthood, once the most desired of all careers, received no recruits
in the twenty years preceding the Reformation. 68</p>
<p>Throughout Latin Christendom men cried out for a “reform of the</p>
<p>Church in head and members.” Passionate Italians like Arnold of
Brescia, Joachim of Flora, and Savonarola of Florence had attacked
ecclesiastical abuses without ceasing to be Catholics, but two of them
had been burned at the stake. Nevertheless, good Christians continued to
hope that reform might be accomplished by the Church’s loyal sons.
Humanists like Erasmus, Colet, More, and Bude dreaded the disorder of an
open break; it was bad enough that the Greek Church remained resolutely
apart from the Roman; any furthe r rending of “the seamless robe of
Christ” threatened the sur - vival of Christianity itself. The Church
tried repeatedly, and often sincerely, to cleanse her ranks and her
courts, and to adopt a financial ethic superior to the lay morality of
the times. The monasteries tried again and again to restore their
austere rules, but the constitution of man rewrote all constitu- tions.
The councils tried to reform the Church, and were defeated by the popes;
the popes tried, and were defeated by the cardinals and the bureauc-
racy of the Curia. Leo X himself, in 1516, mourned the utter inefficacy
of these endeavors. 69 Enlightened churchmen like Nicholas of Cusa
achieved local reforms, but even these were transient. Denunciations of
the Church’s shortcomings, by her enemies and her lovers, excited the
schools, disturbed the pulpits, flooded the literature, mounted day by
day, year by year, in the memory and resentment of men, until the dam of
reverence and tradition burst, and Europe was swept by a religious
revolution more far-reaching and profound than all the political
transformations of modern times.</p>
