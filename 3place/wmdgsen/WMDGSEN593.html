<p>Philosophy Reborn</p>
<p>1564-1648</p>
<p>I. SKEPTICS</p>
<p>U NDER and amid the conflicts of national states, economic
forces,</p>
<p>political parties, and varieties of religious belief, the essential
drama of modern European history was taking form: the fight for life of
a great religion besieged and sapped by science, sectarianism,
epicureanism, and philosophy. Is Christianity dying? Is the religion
that gave morals, courage, and art to Western civilization suffering
slow decay through the spread of knowledge, the widening of astronomic,
geographical, and historical horizons, the realization of evil in
history and the soul, the decline of faith in an afterlife and of trust
in the benevolent guidance of the world? If this is so, it is the basic
event of modern times, for the soul of a civilization is its religion,
and it dies with its faith. To Bruno and Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza,
Pascal and Bayle, Holbach and Helvetius, Voltaire and Hume, Leibniz and
Kant, it was no longer a question of Catholicism versus Protes- tantism,
it was a question of Christianity itself, of doubts and denials rising
about the dearest fundamentals of the ancient creed. The thinkers of
Europe — the vanguard of the European mind — were no longer discussing
the authority of the pope; they were debating the existence of God.</p>
<p>Many factors made for unbelief. The principle of private judgment,
con- demned by the Catholic Church as an invitation to doctrinal and
moral chaos, had been proclaimed, established, and then condemned by
nearly all the Protestant bodies; meanwhile it had undermined the
citadel of belief. Multiplying sects fought one another like
superabundant progeny, exposed one anoth er’s weaknesses, and left faith
naked to rationalist winds. In their war they called both Scripture and
reason to their support; the study of the Bible led to doubts of its
meaning and infallibility, and the appeal to reason ended the Age of
Faith. The Protestant Reformation achieved more than it desired. The
assaults of Biblical criticism especially damaged a Protestant- ism that
had recklessly based itself upon a divinely inspired Bible. Improve-
ments in social order and human security softened terror and cruelty;
men felt compelled to reconceive God in gentler terms than those of Paul
and Augustine, Loyola and Calvin; hell and predestination became in-</p>
<p>613</p>
<p>6i4 the age of reason begins (chap, xxm</p>
<p>credible, and the new morality shamed the old theology. The growth of
wealth and pleasure made for an epicurean life, which sought a philoso-
phy to justify h. Religion was a casualty in the wars of religion. The
in- creasing knowledge of pagan morals and philosophies, of Asiatic
cults and rituals, led to disturbing comparisons with Christianity; have
we not heard Erasmus praying to “Saint Socrates,” and seen Montaigne
reduce</p>
<p>The mildest skeptics were the Unitarians, who in Italy,
Switzerland,</p>
<p>Poland, Holland, and England suggested doubts about the divinity of
Christ. There were already a few deists, who professed belief in a God
loosely identified with Nature, rejected the divinity of Christ, and
wished to make Christianity an ethic rather than a creed; they were as
yet</p>
<p>sporadic and cautious, except when, like Edward Herbert of Cherbury,
they had sufficient status to frighten the hangman; we shall find them
more vocal after 1648. Bolder were the “Epicureans” of Germany, who
laughed at the Last Judgment, which took so long in coming, and at hell,
which was probably not so terrible after all, since all the j oiliest
company gathered there.^ In France such men were called esprits forts
(tough minds) or libertins, whose loose ways began to give its modern
meaning to a word that had originally meant “freethinkers.” In 1581
Philippe Duples - sis-Mornay wrote a book of nine hundred pages, De la
Verite de la religion chretienne, contre les athees; in 1623 the Jesuit
Francois Garasse published a quarto of over a thousand pages, in which
he denounced the beaux esprits who “believe in God only by way of form
or as a maxim of state” and ac - cept only Nature and destiny.^ In that
same year Marin Mersenne estimated the “atheists” of Paris at fifty
thousand,® but that word was then so loosely used that he may have meant
deists. In 1625 Gabriel Naude explained that the divine revelations of
laws to Numa Pompilius and Moses were fables invented to promote social
order, and that the monks of the Thebaid had fabricated their stories of
combats with the Devil to raise their reputa- tion and milk the
credulous mob.* Francois de La Mothe Le Vayer, sec- retary to Richelieu
and tutor to the future Louis XIV, published in 1633 his Dialogues of
Orasius Tabero, professing a general skepticism: “Our knowledge is
asininity, our certainties are fictions, our whole world is . . . a
perpetual comedy.”® H e was one of those whose faith faded before
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>615</p>
<p>multiplicity of infallible creeds. “Amongst that infinity of
religions there is no man who does not believe that he possesses the
true and condemns all the res t.”® Despite his skepticism he married at
seventy -eight and died in bed at eighty-four. Like a good skeptic, he
had made his peace with the Church.</p>
<p>Much of this French skepticism was a negative echo of Montaigne. It
became a positive and constructive force in Montaigne’s friend Pierre -
edge, he says, is derived from the senses and is therefore subject to
the many mistakes and limitations of the senses; truth is not for us.
Fools argue that truth is proved by universal consent, and that vox
populi est vox Dei; Charron believes rather that the voice of the people
is the voice of igno- rance, of opinions manufactured for them, and that
one should be especially skeptical of what is widely believed.’ The soul
is a mysterious, restless, searching activity connected with the brain
and apparently dying with the body.® Religion is composed of unprovable
mysteries and many absurdities, and has been guilty of barbarous
sacrifices and intolerant cruelties. If (as Voltaire would repeat) all
men were philosophers, lovers and practicers of wisdom, religion would
be unnecessary, and societies would live by a na- tural ethic
independent of theology; “I would have a man virtuous without heaven and
hell.”® But considering the natural wickedness and ignorance of mankind,
religion is a necessary means to morality and order.’® Con - sequently
Charron accepts all the fundamentals of Christianity, even to angels and
miracles,” and he advises his sage to observe all the religious rites
prescribed by the churcb to which, however accidentally, he belongs.”* A
true skeptic will never be a heretic.’®</p>
<p>Despite these orthodox conclusions a contemporary Jesuit classed him
with the most wicked and dangerous atheists,’^ and when Charron sud -
denly died, aged sixty-two, of an apoplectic stroke (1603), the pious
called it God’s judgment on his infidelities.’® Shortly before his death
he prepared a second edition, in which he softened his more reckless
passages and assured his fellow clergymen that by Nature he meant God;
his book was put on the Index nevertheless. For half a century it far
surpassed Mon- taigne’s Essays in popularity; De la sagesse had thirty
-five editions in France between 1601 and 1672, and in the eighteenth
century Charron was more influential than his master. But the same
orderliness of exposition that attracted the classic seventeenth century
seemed a dreary and scholastic didacticism in the nineteenth, and
Charron was lost in the rediscovered brilliance and gaiety of
Montaigne.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>GIORDANO BRtJNO: I548-160O</li>
</ol>
<p>Copernicus had enlarged the world. Who would now enlarge God, and
reconceive deity in terms worthy of those numberless and imperturbable
galaxies? Bruno tried.</p>
<p>He was born in Nola, sixteen miles east of Naples. Christened
Filippo, he changed his name to Giordano when, aged seventeen, he
entered the monastery of the Dcwninicans at Naples. There he found a
good library, rich not only in theology but in the Greek and Latin
classics, in Plato and Aristotle, even in Arabic and Hebrew authors who
had been translated into Latin. His poetic nature took readily to the
pagan mythology, which persisted in his thought long after the Christian
theology had faded away. He was fascinated by the atomism of Democritus
as continued by Epicurus and so majestically expounded by Lucretius. He
read the Moslem thinkers Avicenna and Averroes, and the Jewish
philosopher Avicebron (Ibn</p>
<p>Gabirol). Something of Hebrew mysticism entered into him and mingled
with the ideas of Pseudo-Dionysius and Bernardino Telesio on the union
of contraries in Nature and God; something, too, of the vision that</p>
<p>Nicholas of Cusa had had of an infinite universe without center or
circum- ference and animated by a single soul. He admired the rebellious
medical mysticism of Paracelsus, the mystical symbolism and mnemonic
devices of Raymond Lully, and the occult philosophy of Cornelius
Agrippa. All these influences molded him, and inflamed him with
hostility to Aristotle, to Scholasticism, to Thomas Aquinas. But he was
in a Dominican monastery, and Aquinas was the intellectual hero of the
Dominicans.</p>
<p>Inevitably the young monk troubled his superiors with objections,
ques- tions, and theories. Moreover, sex was simmering in his blood; he
con- fessed later that not all the snows of the Caucasus could quench
his fires; and there is some subtle connection between sexual and
intellectual awaken- ing. He took full priestly orders in 1572, but
doubts continued to agitate him secretly. How could there be three
persons in one God? How could a priest, with whatever formula, transform
bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ? Twice, after his
ordination, he was formally censured by his superiors. Suddenly, in
1576, after eleven years as a monk, he fled from the monastery, and for
a while he hid himself in Rome. He discarded his monastic gown, resumed
his baptismal name, and sought safety and privacy as a teacher of a
school for boys in Noli, near Genoa.</p>
<p>So began sixteen years of wandering, in which the restlessness of his
body kept pace with the vacillations of his mind. After four months in
Noli he moved to Savona, then to Turin, to Venice, to Padua. To secure
mon- astic hospitality he donned again the garb of a Dominican monk.
Then on to CHAP. XXIIl) PHILOSOPHY REBORN 617</p>
<p>Brescia, to Bergamo, and over the Alps to Chambery, where a Dominican
monastery received and fed him. Then to Lyon. Then to Geneva. There, in
the citadel of Calvinism, he again divested himself of his monastic
robe. For two months he lived in uncongenial peace, earning his bread by
cor- recting manuscripts and proofs. Among these was his own review of a
lecture given at the University of Geneva by a Calvinist theologian.
Bruno pointed out twenty errors in that lecture. The printer of his
review was arrested and fined; Bruno himself was called to trial before
the Consistory . He apologized and was excused. Disappointed to find
that he had escaped one censorship to fall under another, he left
Geneva, returned to Lyon, and passed on to Toulouse. There some measure
of tolerance transiently ap- peared through the rivalry of Catholics and
Huguenots and the influx of only slightly converted Jews from Spain and
Portugal. Probably during Bruno’s stay (1581) Frangois Sanchez pub
lished at Toulouse his skeptical treatise Of the Right Noble Knowledge .
. . that Nothing Is Known</p>
<p>(Quod Jiihil scitur). For eighteen months Bruno lectured on
Aristotle’s De anima. Then, for reasons unknown — perhaps desiring a
more capital fame — he moved up to Paris.</p>
<p>He had acquired a reputation not only as a philosopher but as an
expert in mnemonics. Henry III sent for him and solicited the magic
secrets of a good memory. The King was pleased with Bruno’s lessons and
appointed him to a professorship in the College de France. For two years
Bruno bore with peace. But in 1582 he published a comedy, Candelaio (The
Torch- bearer), in which with verve and fury he satirized monks,
professors, pedants, and — but let the Prologue speak:</p>
<p>You will see, in mixed confusion, snatches of cutpurses, miles of</p>
<p>cheats, enterprises of rogues; also delicious disgusts, bitter
sweets,</p>
<p>foolish decisions, mistaken faith and crippled hopes, niggard
charities,</p>
<p>. . . virile women, effeminate men . . . and everywhere the love
of</p>
<p>gold. Hence proceed quartan fevers, spiritual cancers, light
thoughts, ruling follies, . . . advancing knowledge, fruitful action,
purposive</p>
<p>industry. In fine you will see, throughout, naught secure, . . .
little</p>
<p>beauty, and nothing of good.</p>
<p>He signed the play “Bruno the Nolan, Graduate of the Academy, Called
the Nuisance.”^®</p>
<p>And so, in March 1583, he tried England. Henry III, “readier to recom
- mend him to others than to retain his services,”^^ gave him letters of
intro - duction to the French ambassador in London, Michel de Castelnau,
Sieur de la Mauvissiere. Now began Bruno’s happiest interlude. For two
years he lived and ate in the ambassador’s mansion, free from economic
necessities, writing some of his most important works, always finding
refuge there</p>
<p>6i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xxin</p>
<p>from the storms precipitated by his character, and comforted in his
con- troversies by a tolerant man of the world who knew better than to
take metaphysics seriously. In that home Bruno met Sir Philip Sidney,
the Earl of Leicester, John Florio, Edmund Spenser, Gabriel Harvey, and
others of the finest minds in Elizabethan England. These conversations
provided the basis of Bruno’s symposium La cena de le Ceneri. He met the
great Queen herself, and eulogized her in terms that were later held
against him by the Inquisition.</p>
<p>In 1583 he requested of Oxford University the privilege of
lecturing</p>
<p>in its halls, and expounded his qualifications in terms that forever
cleared him of any imputation of modesty. Permission given, he spoke on
the immortality of the soul and on “the fivefold sphere” — i.e., the
planetary system of Copernicus. He was heckled by, among others, the
rector of Lincoln College, as he tells us in his own way:</p>
<p>Would you hear how they were able to reply to his 〔Bruno’s〕</p>
<p>arguments? How fifteen times, by means of fifteen syllogisms, a poor
doctor whom on this solemn occasion they had put forward as the</p>
<p>very Corypheus of the Academy was left standing like a chick en-</p>
<p>tangled in tow? Would you learn with what incivility and discourtesy
that pig comported himself, and the patience and humanity of him</p>
<p>who showed himself to be bom a Neapolitan and nurtured under a</p>
<p>more benign sky? Are you informed how they closed his public lec-</p>
<p>tures?^*</p>
<p>Later he called Oxford the “widow of sound learning” (vedova de
le</p>
<p>buone lettere), a “constellation of pedantic and most obstinate
ignoranc e and presumption, mixed with rustic incivility that would
exhaust the pa- tience of Job.”*®</p>
<p>Our philosopher was no Job. He wrote brilliantly about the stars and
found earthlings intolerably dull. He felt that his philosophical
develop- ment of Copemican astronomy was a beneficent advance in
understanding, and he was “a biting critic”®^ of all who rejected his
views, though Florio found him, when appeased, “gentle and urbane.”®®
His vanity was a trial to his friends as well as the wind in his sails.
He gave himself the most magnifi- cent titles — “doctor of the more
developed theology, professor of purer and harmless wisdom.”®® He had
the fervid imagination, the excitable eloquence, of a Neapolitan;
wherever he went the sun of the south heated his blood. “For love of
true wisdom,” he said, “and zeal for true contem - plation, I tire,
torment, and crucify myself.”®^</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1585 he returned to Paris in the suite of the
recalled ambassador. He lectured at the Sorbonne, exciting the hostility
of the Aristotelians as usual. The war of the League against Henry III
persuaded</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) PHILOSOPHY REBORN 619</p>
<p>Bruno to sample German universities. In July 1586 he registered at
the University of Marburg; refused the right to lecture, he denounced
the rector and went on to Wittenberg. For two years he lectured at
Luther’s university; departing, he voiced his gratitude in a soaring
valedictory, but the theology of the reformers did not attract him. He
sought the patronage of Rudolf II at Prague; the Emperor thought him
fantastic, but gave him three hundred thalers and permission to teach at
the University of Helm- stedt in Brunswick. For some months he was
happy; then the head of the Luther an Church there denounced and
excommunicated him.^“ We do not know the upshot, but Bruno passed on to
Frankfurt to Zurich to Frankfurt (1590-91), where he settled down to
publish his Latin works.</p>
<p>By this time — one year before his imprisonment by the Inquisition —
his philosophy was complete, though it never achieved clarity or
coherent form. On looking into Bruno’s chief writings we are struck by
the titles, which are here given in abbreviated form.* Often they are
poetic and obscure and warn us to expect rather reveries and ecstasies
than a sys- tematic or consistent philosophy. Hardly elsewhere, outside
of Rabelais, shall we find such a gallimaufry of epithets, rhetoric,
allegories, symbols, myths, “humours,” conceits, bom bast, trivia,
exaltation, burlesque, and wit, piled one upon another in a nebulous
confusion of dogmas, insights, and hypotheses. Bruno inherited the skill
of the Italian dramatists, the scandal- ous hilarity of the macaronic
poets, the slashing satire of Bemi and Aretino. If philosophy means calm
perspective, reasoned restraint, ability to see all sides, tolerance of
difference, even sympathy for simpletons, Bruno was not a philosopher
but a warrior, who put on blinders lest surrounding dangers should
divert him from his goal — which was, two centuries before Voltaire, e
eraser Pinfdme, to smash the infamy of obscurantism and per- secution.
There is something bitterer than Voltaire in the savage sarcasm
wherewith he satirizes the theological idealization of unt h in ki ng
faith;</p>
<p>There is not, there is not, I say, a better mirror placed before
human eyes than Asininity or the ass, or which demonstrates more
clearly</p>
<p>the duty of that man who . . . looks for the reward of the final
judg-</p>
<p>ment. . . . On the other hand, nothing is more effective to engulf
us</p>

who are already asses, study … to proceed from good to better, so</p>

will</p>
<p>obtain grace in the Church Militant and glory in the Church Tri-</p>
<p>umphant, in which God lives and reigns through all ages. Amen.^®</p>
<p>Bruno’s vision of the universe is primarily aesthetic, a profound and
wondering appreciation of an incandescent infinity; but it is also a
philo- sophical attempt to adjust human thought to a cosmos in which our
planet is an infinitesimal part of an unknowable immensity. The earth is
not the center of the world, nor is the sun; beyond the world that we
see (there were no telescopes when Bruno wrote) there are other worlds
(as tele- scopes were soon to show), and beyond these other worlds are
other worlds again (as better telescopes were to show), and so on
endlessly; we cannot conceive an end, nor a beginning. And instead of
the “fixed” stars being fixed, as Copernicus thought, they change their
place constantly; even in the skies panta rei, all things flow. Space,
time, and motion are relative; there is no center, no circumference, no
up or down; the same motion differs when seen from different places or
stars; and as time is the measure of motion, time too is relative.
Probably many stars are inhabited by living, intelligent beings; did
Christ die for them too? Yet in this endless immensity there is an
invariable conservation of matter, an eternal and inviolable constancy
of law.</p>
<p>Since the universe is infinite, and there cannot be two infinites,
the in- finite God and the infinite universe must be one (here is
Spinoza’s Deus sive substantia sive Natura — “God or substance or
Nature”). There is no Prime Mover, as Aristotle supposed, there is
motion or energy inherent in every part of the whole. “God is not an
external intelligence … It is more worthy for him to be the internal
principle of motion, which is his own nature, his own soul.”^^ Nature is
the outside the Divine Mind; however, this Mind is not in a “heaven
above,” but in every particle of r eality.</p>
<p>The world is composed of minute monads, indivisible units of force,
of life, of inchoate mind (here Bruno is a bridge between Lucretius and
Leibniz). Each particle has its own individuality, has a mind of its
own; and yet its freedom is not liberation from law but (as in Spinoza)
be- havior according to its own inherent law and character. There is
a</p>
<p>principle of progress and evolution in Nature in the sense that every
part strives for development (Aristotle’s entelecheia) .</p>
<p>There are opposites in Nature, contrary forces, contradictions; but
in the</p>

<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>operation of the whole cosmos — in the “will of God” — all contraries
coin- cide and disappear; so the diverse motions of the planets make the
harmony of the spheres. Behind the bewildering, fascinating variety of
Nature is the yet more marvelous unity, wherein all parts appear as
organs of one organ- ism. “It is Unity that enc hants me. By her power I
am free though thrall, happy in sorrow, rich in poverty, alive even in
death.”*® (Though I am subject to law, I express my own nature; though I
suffer, I find solace in recognizing that the “evil” of the part becomes
meaningless in the perspec- tive of the whole; though I die, the death
of the part is the rejuvenating life of the whole.) Hence the knowledge
of the supreme unity is the goal of science and philosophy, and the
healing medicine of the mind (Spinoza’s “intellectual love of God”).</p>
<p>This crude summary of Bruno’s philosophy leaves out all his spark and
heroic frenzy, and implies in his thought a continuity and consistency
quite alien to it, for it contains as many contradictions as
asseverations, and a flux of moods agreeing only in cosmic inebriation.
Another selection of his ideas could make him a magian mystic. He talked
of the individual vir- tues of the several planets; he thought that
persons born “under the influ - ence” of Venus are disposed to love,
rhet oric, and peace, those under Mars to strife and hate. He believed
in the occult qualities of objects and num- bers, and that diseases may
be demons and may in some cases be cured by a king’s touch or the
spittle of a seventh son.*®</p>
<p>His final delusion was his hope that if he returned to Italy and
should be questioned by the Inquisition, he could (as well he might)
quote enough orthodox passages from his works to deceive the Church into
thinking him her loving son. Perhaps he hoped that Italy had not heard
of the book he had published in England, The Expulsion of the Triumphant
Beast, in which the beast to be expelled could be interpreted as
Catholicism, or Christianity, or theological dogmas in general.®® He
must have longed for Italy, for how else shall we explain the eagerness
with which he accepted the invitation of Giovanni Mocenigo to come to
Venice as his teacher and guest? Mocenigo belonged to one of Venice’s
most illustrious families . He was a pious Catholic, but he was
interested in occult powers, and had been told that Bruno was well
informed on all branches of magic and had the secrets of a tenacious
memory. The Inquisition had long since declared Bruno an outlaw to be
arrested at the first opportunity, but Venice was famed for protecting
such outlaws and defying the Inquisitors. So, in the fall of 1591, Bruno
hurriedly left Frankfurt and made his way over the Alps to Italy.</p>
<p>Mocenigo gave him rooms and took lessons from him in mnemonics. The
pupil’s progress was slow, and he wondered whether his teacher was with
- holding from him some esoteric magical lore; meanwhile he trembled at
the</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXIll</p>
<p>heresies which the loquacious and incautious philosopher expressed.
Mo- cenigo asked his confessor if he should report Bruno to the
Inquisition; the priest advised him to wait until he had drawn out his
instructor more definitely. Mocenigo obeyed; but when Bruno announced
his intention of returning to Frankfurt, Mocenigo notified the
Inquisitors, and on May 23, 1592, Bruno found himself in the prison of
the Holy Office in Venice. Mocenigo explained that he had acted “by the
constraint of his conscienc e and by order of his confessor.”®^ He
informed the Inquisitors that Bruno was averse to all religions, though
he liked Catholicism best; that he denied the Trinity, the Incarnation,
and transubstantiation; that he charged Christ and the Apostles with
having deceived the people through alleged miracles; Bruno had said that
all friars were asses, defiling the earth by their hypocrisy, avarice,
and evil life, that religion should be replaced by philosophy, that
indulgence in “carnal pleasures” is not s inful, and that he, Bruno, had
satisfied his passions to the extent of his opportunities;®® Bruno had
told him that “ladies pleased him well, though he had not yet reached
Solomon’s number.”®®</p>
<p>The Inquisition examined the prisoner at its leisure, from May to
Sep- tember 1592. Bruno pleaded that he had written as a philosopher and
had availed himself of Pomponazzi’s distinction between the “two truths”
— that one might question, as a philosopher, doctrines that he accepted
as a Catholic. He admitted his doubts as to the Trinity. He confessed
that he had been guilty of many errors; he professed repentance and
besought the tribunal, “knowing my infirmity, to embrace me to the
breast of</p>
<p>Mother Church, providing me with remedies suitable for my welfare,
and using me with mercy.”®^ The Inquisitors gave him no comfort, but re
- turned him to his cell. On July 30 they examined him again, heard his
con- fession and his plea for mercy, and again remanded him to his cell
for another two months. In September the head of the Roman Inquisition
in- structed the Venetian Inquisitors to send their prisoner to Rome.
The Venetian government objected, but the Inquisitors pointed out that
Bruno was a citizen of Naples, not of Venice, and the Senate consented
to his extradition. On February 27, 1593, Bruno was deported to
Rome.</p>
<p>It was part of Inquisition procedure to let a prisoner brood in jail
for long periods before, between, and after examinations. Almost a year
passed before Bruno was brought before the Roman tribunal in December
1593. He was examined again — or tortured by questioning — in April,
May, Sep- tember, and December 1594. In January 1595 the Inquisitors met
twice to study the record; in March 1595 and April 1596 Bruno, says the
trial record, “was brought before the Lord Cardinals and was visited” in
his cell “and was interrogated by them and heard concerning his
necessities.”®® In December 1 596 his complaints were heard “concerning
food.” In March</p>

<p>1 597 he was brought before the examiners, who again “heard him
concern - ing his necessities”; we are not told what these were, but the

<p>He was heard again on February 18 and in April, September, and</p>
<p>November. On December 21 he declared that he would not retract. On
January 20, 1600, he addressed a memorial to the Pope, claiming that the
condemned propositions had been wrongly taken from their context, offer-
ing to defend them against any theologians, and again expressing
willing- ness to accept the decision of the Pope. Thereupon, reads the
record, “the most holy lord. Pope Clement VIII, decreed and commanded
that the cause be carried to final measures, . . . sentence be
pronounced, and the said Brother Jordanus be committed to the secular
court.” On February 8 the Inquisitors summoned Bruno, repeated the
accusations, and told him that he had been allowed eight years in which
to repent; that he had agreed to accept the decision of the Pope as to
whether his propositions were heret- ical; that the Pope had so decided,
and that the prisoner still persisted in his heresies, continuing
“impenitent, obstinate, and pertinacious”; where - fore sentence was now
passed upon him that he should be “delivered to the secular court, … to
the Governor of Rome here present, that thou mayest be punished with the
punishment deserved, though we earnestly pray that he will mitigate the
rigor of the laws concerning the pains of thy person, that thou mayest
not be in danger of death or of mutilation of thy members.” The sentence
was signed by nine cardinals, including Bellar - mine. According to
Caspar Scioppius, a German scholar recently converted to Catholicism and
then residing in Rome, when the verdict was read to Bruno he said to his
judges, “Perchance you who pronounce my sentence</p>
<p>He was at once transferred to a secular prison. On February 19,
still</p>
<p>impenitent, his body nude, his tongue tied, he was bound to an iron
stake on a pyre in the Piazza Campo de’ Fiori and was burned alive, in
the presence of an edified multitude. He was fifty-two years old. On

</ol>
<p>Nineteen years later a kindred spirit moved quickly to a like fate.
Giulio Cesare Lucilio Vanini was born in southern Italy of an Italian
father and a Spanish mother — powder mating with fire. After wandering
over Europe like Bruno, sampling climates and theologies, and writing
books whose oc- casional insights (as that man had once been a
quadruped) hardly balanced the occult nonsense, he settled down in
Toulouse (1617) and, again like Bruno, enjoyed there two years of peace.
But an attendant at his lectures reported him as laughing at the
Incarnation and questioning the existence of a personal God.®’^ Another
hearer, Sieur de Francon, gained Vanini’s con - fidence, drew him out as
Mocenigo had done with Bruno, and reported him to the municipal
parlement. On August 2, 1618, he was arrested not by the Church but by
order of the Procurator-General of the King. On the basis of his
lectures he was accused of atheism and blasphemy, both of them crimes
punishable by the state. Vanini affirmed his belief in God, but Francon
alleged that the prisoner had more than once professed atheism, saying
that Nature was the only God. The judges accepted the evidence, and
despite Vanini’s passionate protests and the piety that he showed in his
cell, they condemned him — ^thirty-four years old —</p>
<p>to be delivered into the hands of the executioner of justice, who
shall draw him on a hurdle, in his shirt, with a halter about his neck,
and</p>
<p>bearing upon his shoulders a placard with the words atheist and</p>
<p>BLASPHEMER OF THE NAME OF GOD; he shall thus conduct him before the
principal entrance to the church of St. Stephen, and being there placed
on his knees … he shall ask pardon from God, from the King, and</p>
<p>from Justice for his said blasphemies. Afterward he shall bring
him</p>
<p>into the Place of Salin, bind him to a stake there erected, cut off
his</p>
<p>tongue and strangle him, and afterward his body shall be burned . . .
and the ashes thrown to the wind.®®</p>
<p>Tradition tells that as Vanini came from his cell to bear his agony
(Febru- ary 9, 1619), he exclaimed, “Andiamo, andiamo allegramente a
morire da filosofo^’ (Let us go, let us go cheerfully to die like a
philosopher).®*</p>
<p>Tommaso Campanella too was born with Calabrian lava in his blood. He
cooled it for a while in a Dominican monastery, studied Telesio and
Empedocles, rejected Aristotle, ridiculed a papal excommunication,
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>625</p>
<p>was imprisoned for some months by the Inquisition at Naples
(1591-92). Released, he took courses at Padua, and was indicted for
unchastity. There he wrote his first significant work, Prodromos
philosophiae instaurendae (1594), in which, like Francis Bacon eleven
years later, he advised thinkers to study Nature rather than Aristotle,
and outlined a program for the restoration of science and philosophy.
Returning to Naples, he joined a conspiracy to free it from Spain; the
plot was frustrated, and Campanella languished in state jails for
twenty-seven years (1599-1626). Twelve times he was tortured, once for
forty hours.^® He allayed his suffering with philosophy, poetry, and
visions of perfect states. His sonnet “The People” voices his resentment
at the failure of the populace to support his revolt:</p>
<p>The people is a beast of muddy brain</p>
<p>That knows not its own force and therefore stands</p>
<p>Loaded with wood and stone; the powerless hands</p>
<p>Of a mere child guide it with bit and rein.</p>
<p>One kick would be enough to break the chain;</p>
<p>But the beast fears, and what the child demands</p>
<p>It does, nor its own terror understands.</p>
<p>Confused and stupefied by bugbears vain.</p>
<p>Most wonderful, with its own hand it ties</p>
<p>And gags itself — gives itself death and war</p>
<p>For pence doled out by kings from its own store.</p>
<p>Its own are all things between earth and heaven.</p>
<p>But this it knows not; and if one arise</p>
<p>To tell this truth, it kills him unforgiven.^^</p>
<p>The most famous product of those weary years was his Civitas soils.
Cam- panella imagined his City of the Sun as standing on a mountain in
Ceylon. Its officials are chosen — and are removable — by a national
assembly of all inhabitants over twenty years old. The magistrates so
chosen choose the head of the government, a priest called Hoh. He and
his aides rule in all matters, temporal or spiritual. They preside also
over the union of the sexes, seeing to it “that men and women are so
joined together that they bring forth the best offspring. Indeed, they
laugh at us who exhibit a studious care for our breed of horses and
dogs, but neglect the breeding of human beings.”^^ Hence deformity is
unknown. Women are communistically shared and sternly disciplined. They
are required to take active exercise, which “gives them a clear
complexion. .. . If any woman dyes her face or uses high- heeled boots .
. . she is condemned to capital punishment.”^^ Both the sexes are
trained to war. Those who flee from battle are, when caught, put to
death by being placed in a den of lions and bears.^’* Everyone is

<p>in common and are psychologically prepared for a communistic sharing
of goods. The religion of these people is a worship of the sun as
the</p>
<p>“face and living image of God.” “They assert that the whole earth
will come to live in accordance with their customs.”^®</p>
<p>This communist manifesto, echoing Plato, was written in jail about
1602 and was published in Frankfurt am Main in 1622. Perhaps it
expressed the aspirations of the Neapolitan conspirators and may have
contributed to Campanella’s long incarceration. In time he made his
peace with the Church and was released. He delighted Urban VIII by
asserting the right of the popes to rule kings. In 1634 Urban sent him
to Paris to save him from implication in another Neapolitan revolt.
Richelieu protected him, and the tired rebel, recapturing his youth,
died in a Dominican cell (1639). “I am the bell 〔campanella〕,’’ he
said, “that announces the new dawn.”*®</p>

<li>PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Jtian de Mariana: 1^^6-1624</li>
</ol>
<p>The central feature of medieval politics was the unifying supremacy
of the papacy over the kings; the outstanding aspect of modern political
his- tory is the conflict of national states freed from papal power;
hence the first question that agitated political philosophy in the
century after the Reformation was the demand of Catholic thinkers that
papal supremacy be restored, and the demand of Protestant thinkers that
papal authority be wholly destroyed. Papal polemists argued that
absolute kings, claiming divine right and repudiating all restraints by
religion, morals, and law, would tear Europe to pieces; the defenders of
the Reformation replied that no supranational authority could be trusted
to seek the good of mankind rather than its own power and profit;
moreover, a supreme Church would stifle all freedom of life and
thought.</p>
<p>The Scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages, echoing Roman
jurists, had derived all royal authority from the consent of the people
rather than from God; consequently there was no divine right of kings,
and a bad ruler might be justly dethroned. Calvinist thinkers, like
Brae, Buchanan, and the author of Vindiciae contra tyrannos, warmly
seconded this view; but Lu- theran and Anglican theologians supported
the divine right of kings as a necessary offset to public violence and
papal claims, and upheld the duty of obedience even to unjust
kings.*^</p>
<p>The defenders of popular sovereignty included many Jesuits, who saw
in this view a means of weakening royal as against papal authority.
If,</p>

<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>627</p>
<p>argued Cardinal Bellarmine, the authority of kings is derived from,
and therefore subject to, the people, it is obviously subordinate to the
authority of the popes, which is derived from the establishment of the
Church by Christ, and is therefore subject only to God. Luis Molina, a
Spanish</p>
<p>Jesuit, concluded that the people, as the source of secular
authority, may justly — but by orderly procedure — depose an unjust
king.^® Francisco Suarez, “the finest theologian the Society of Jesus
has produced,”^® re - stated this view, with careful modifications, in
countering the absolutist claims of James I, and upheld the right of
popes to unseat kings. The Jesuit Juan de Mariana’s defense of
tyrannicide roused an international furor because it was alleged to have
encouraged the assassination of Henry IV.</p>
<p>Mariana (whom we have already noted as the greatest historian of his
generation) was in all ways a remarkable individual, renowned for learn-
ing, eloquence, and intellectual audacity. In 1599 he dedicated to
Philip III, and published with the permission of the local Jesuit
censor, the</p>
<p>treatise De rege et regis institutione (On the King and His
Education). Anticipating Hobbes by half a century, he described a “state
of nature” - sembly checked this delegated power, retained control of
the purse, and formed a body o f laws whose authority was superior to
the king’s.</p>
<p>Democracy, in Mariana’s view, is made impossible by the unequal dis -
tribution of ability and intelligence among men. It would be ruinous to
let policy be determined by plebiscites.®® A limited, or constitutional,
mon- archy is the best form of government compatible with the nature of
man and the survival of the state. It should be hereditary, for an
elective mon- archy is a periodic invitation to anarchy.</p>
<p>The king should be limited by laws, by religious and moral
restraints, and by the right of the people to depose him if he becomes a
tyrant. He must not change the laws or levy taxes without the people’s
consent. He “should determine nothing about religion,”” for the Church
is superior to the state and must rule herself; nevertheless he must
protect the national religion, for “if religion is neglected a state
cannot stand firm.”®^ The state should support religion in maintaining
morality; it should condemn</p>

<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>bullfights as encouraging brutality, and the stage as stimulating
sexual license.^® It should finance the care of the sick and the poor
through a wide distribution of hospitals and charity; and the rich
should give to the needy what they now spend on their luxuries and their
dogs. Taxes should be high on superfluities, low on necessaries. The
goods of the earth would suffice for all if they were rightly
distributed.®^ A good prince will guard against the concentration of
wealth. Private property replaced primitive communism because “greedy
and furious avarice laid its hand upon the divine gifts and claimed
everything for itself”;®® it is now a necessary in - stitution, but in
heaven communism will be restored.®®</p>

unless</p>

<p>men are associated in the deliberation. . . . 〔But〕 when a prince

only</p>
<p>justly but with praise and glory .®^</p>
<p>Mariana reminded his readers of historic tyrannicides — of Harmodius
and Aristogeiton who killed Hipparchus, tyrant of Athens, and of Brutus
who drove the tyrant Tarquinius from Rome; and he pointed out that
Athens and Rome, indeed all literate Europe, honored their memory. But
Mariana showed his hand and bias by half approving the recent (1589)
assassination of Henry III by Clement:</p>

<p>Henry III, it will be recalled, had opposed the Catholic League
and</p>
<p>had ordered his aides to kill Henri, Duke of Guise, its leader.
Philip II of Spain had supported and in part financed the League; he had
agreed to the assassination of Elizabeth I and William of Orange. And
Philip III had no objection to a doctrine that justified the killing of
an enemy of Spain.</p>
<p>In 1599 Claudio Aquaviva, general of the Society of Jesus, ordered
that Mariana’s De rege should be “corrected.” When Henry IV was murdered
by Ravaillac (May 14, 1610), Aquaviva condemned Mariana’s teaching on
tyrannicide (July 8), and forbade its propagation in Jesuit instruction.
Meanwhile Mariana had been arrested, not for praising tyrannicide but
for arguing against Philip Ill’s debasement of the coinage and warning
him in a brilliant treatise, De monetae mutatione (1605), of the evils
of inflation. Mariana suffered his confinement philosophically, survived
it, and lived on till 1624, dying at the age of eighty-seven.</p>
<p>2 . Jean Bodin: i$^o -^6</p>
<p>How different was Bodin! No theologian with his feet in the sky,
no</p>
<p>somber lover of the League, but a Politique after L’Hopital’s heart,
a defender of toleration, a counselor and admirer of Henry IV. Born at
Angers, probably of a Spanish-Jewish mother, he came to Paris in 1560,
practiced law unprofitably, and lost himself eagerly in philosophy and
history. He studied voraciously Hebrew, Greek, German, Italian, Livy,
Tacitus, the Old Testament, Cicero, and the constitutions of all the
West European states. He believed that the study of history is the
beginning of political wisdom. His first venture into print was a
Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem (1566) — Method for the Easy
Understanding of History. The student will find it jejune, rhetorical,
verbose — the philo- sophic mind does not mature early. Bodin, at
thirty-six, thought that history inspires us to virtue by showing the
defeat of the wicked and the triumph of the good.®® Nevertheless the
book, after Machiavelli’s Discourses, is the first significant work on
the philosophy of history.</p>
<p>Here and in the later De republica, a century and a half before Vico
and Montesquieu, is a systematic consideration of climate and race as
factors in history. History is a function of geography — of temperature,
rainfall, soil, topography. Geography determines character, and
character determines history. Men differ in character and conduct
according as they live on mountains, plains, or the sea. In the north
they excel in physical strength and muscular energy, in the south in
nervous sensitivity and subtlety of mind; men in the Temperate Zone, as
in the Mediterranean nations and France, unite the qualities of north
and south — more practical than in</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xxm</p>
<p>the south, more intellectual than in the north. The government of a
people should be adapted to its geographically and racially determined
character, which hardly changes in time. So the peoples of the north
should be ruled by force, those of the south by religion.</p>
<p>In a minor work, Reponse au paradoxe de M. Le Malestroict, Bodin</p>
<p>almost founded “political economy.”*® He analyzed the reasons why
prices were rising so rapidly in Europe, discussed the evils of a
debased currency, advocated freedom of trade in an age of natural and
regional protec- tionism, and emphasized the relations between economic
realities and governmental policies.</p>
<p>But his chef- d’oeuvre — the most important contribution to political
philosophy between Machiavelli and Hobbes — ^was La Republique (1576).
Bodin used this word in its Roman sense, as meaning any state. He dis-
tinguished between the state and society: society is founded on the
family, which has a natural basis in the relations of the sexes and the
generations; the state is founded on artificial force. In its natural
form the family was patriarchal — the father had absolute power over his
wives, his children, and the family property; and perhaps civilization
has dangerously reduced the patriarchal rights. Woman should always be
subject to man, for she is mentally weaker; to raise her to equality
would be a fatal disregard of Nature. The husband should always have the
right of divorce at will, as in the Old Testament. The decline of
paternal authority and family dis- cipline (thought Bodin) was already
sapping the natural foundations of social order. For the family, not the
state, is the unit and source of order and morality, and when family
unity and discipline decay, no number of laws can take their place.®^
Private property is indispensable to the struc- ture and continuance of
the family. Communism is impossible because all men are born
unequal.*®</p>
<p>Bodin is more realistic than Mariana and Rousseau in discussing the
origin of the state; there is no nonsense here about a social compact or
contract. Village communities might originate in such an agreement, but
the state originated in the conquest of one group of families by
another, and the leader of the victors became king.** The sanction
behind the laws was not the will or “sovereignty” of the people, it was
the organized force of the government. Consequently absolute monarchy is
natural; it contin- ues in the state the power of the father in the
patriarchal family; no govern- ment is sovereign if it is subject to any
laws but those of Nature and of God.*^ Just as Hobbes was to run to
these conclusions in flight from the chaos caused by the English Civil
War of 1642-49, so Bodin saw in an absolute government the only escape
from the Religious Wars and the division of France; note that his book
was published only four years after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew; it
could have been written in the blood</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>631</p>
<p>that ran in the streets of Paris. It seemed to Bodin that if the
function of the state is to maintain order, it can do this only through
absolute and inalienable sovereignty.</p>
<p>Hence the best form of government is unlimited and hereditary mon-
archy: it must be unlimited if it is not to end in chaos, and it must be
hereditary to avoid wars of succession. Alonarchy, like paternal
authority, has prevailed over most of the earth and through the longest
time; it has the sanction of history. Democracies have only briefly
ruled states. They go to pieces on the fickleness of the people and the
incompetence and ve- nality of popularly elected officials.<em>® “In
every popular assembly the votes are counted without weighing them 〔for
the quality of thought behind the vote〕 ; and always the number of the
foolish, the wicked and the ignorant is a thousand times greater than
the number of men of worth.” The salvation of democracy is that behind
the pretense of equality only a small minority rules, and the balance of
brains outweighs the count of heads.®</em></p>
<p>Bodin recognized that some escape would have to be found from ab-
solutism if the monarch became a tyrant; therefore, perhaps illogically,
he allowed the right of revolution and tyrannicide. He admitted that
even his complete monarchies would in time decay and be overthrown by
ineluctable change. Anticipating Hegel, he divided history into three
periods, the first dominated by Oriental states, the second by
Mediterra- nean nations, the third by north-European countries. Through
this con- catenation of rising and falling states Bodin thought he saw
some progress. The Golden Age lies not in the mythical past but in a
future that will reap the results of the greatest of all inventioas —
print.®’ And the sciences, he wrote (half a century before Bacon),
“contain in themselves treasure that no future ages will ever be able to
exhaust.”*®</p>
<p>Bodin was a freethinker with a wholesome regard for the Bible
(or,</p>
<p>rather, for the Old Testament — he almost ignores the New), and with
strong convictions about the reality of witchcraft, angels, demons,
astrol- ogy, and the necessity of building a state in accord with the
mystic virtues of numbers. He called for the severest sentences against
witches. He ad- vised princes to maintain unity of religious belief as
long as possible; but if a heresy should become powerful and widespread,
it would be unwise to use force in its suppression; better rely on time
to win the heretics to the official faith.</p>
<p>What that faith should be Bodin did not say. His own faith was
dubious. In his strange Heptoplofneres colloquium {Colloquy of Seven
Men), which he cleverly left unpublished (it was first printed in 1841),
he pictured a Catholic, a Lutheran, a Calvinist, a Jew, a .Mohammedan,
an Epicurean, and a deist in disputation at Venice. Judaism comes off
well, the Christian dogmas of original sin, the Trinity, and the
Incarnation are more strongly</p>

<p>attacked than defended; and only the belief in God emerges unharmed.
Bodin’s critics denounced him as a Jew, a Calvinist, and an atheist, and
re - ported that he died without religion, “like a dog.” But belief in
the divine guidance of the world is vigorously expressed in The
Republic, and</p>
<p>atheism is put beyond the pale of toleration, as making nonsense of
the universe.®*</p>
<p>Bodin, like Hobbes, was a frightened man trying to reason his way to
stability amid the flux of revolution and war. His greatest book was in-
fected by his time; it was a philosophy for a disordered world longing
for order and peace. It cannot compare with the urbane wisdom of the
Essais of the less harassed Montaigne in those same years. And yet no
one since Aristotle — except possibly Ibn Khaldun — had spread political
philosophy over so wide a field, or defended his prejudices with so much
learning and force. Not till H obbes’s Leviathan (1651) shall we find so
resolute an effort to discover a logic in the ways of states.</p>

especially for the Dutch, who were challenging the Portuguese assumption
of maritime monopoly in the Far East. Appointed historiographer for the
United Provinces, he composed in almost classical Latin a spirited but
accurate history of the great revolt. We have seen him fighting on the

Maurice of Nassau. Arrested, he confessed his errors,’’® and was let off
with life imprisonment. His wife begged and was allowed to share his

<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>I saw prevailing throughout the Christian world a license, in
making</p>
<p>war, of which even barbarous nations would have been ashamed, re-
course being had to arms for slight reasons or no reason; and when</p>
<p>arms were once taken up, all reverence for divine and human laws</p>
<p>was thrown away, as if men were thenceforth authorized to commit all
crimes without restraint.’’^</p>
<p>Machiavelli had argued that states cannot be preserved unless they
are absolved flrom obeying the moral code laid upon their citizens;
statesmen must be ready — usually by proxy — ^to lie, rob, and kill as
amply as may seem to them desirable for the good of the state. For
states, as yet, live in a jungle stage like that of families before
states came; they know no law but that of self-preservation. Grotius
admits that governments may be exempt from lex — i .e., “positive,” man
-made law; but he holds them bound to obey ius naturale. He defines this
“natural right” or law as “the dictate of right reason showing the moral
turpitude, or the moral necessity, of any act from its agreement or
disagreement with a rational nature, and con- sequently 〔showing〕 that
such an act is either forbidden or commanded by God, the author of
nature.”’^ Natural law, then, is that system of rights and duties which
follows from the essential nature of man as a rational being living in a
society. Whatever is necessary for his existence and his participation
in society is his natural right, it is something due to his nature. The
behavior of states should observe these rights.</p>
<p>Moreover (Grotius continues), it should be subject to ius gentium.
Ro- man jurisprudence had used this term to mean the laws of peoples not
included in Roman citizenship. When the western Roman Empire broke up,
medieval jurists applied it to the relations of states with one another.
In Grotius it becomes the vague accumulation of rules and restraints
customarily accepted by the most developed nations in their mutual con-
tacts. On these two bases — ius naturale and ius gentium — ^he builds
his theoretical structure, the first modern formulation of desirable
inter- national law.</p>
<p>He by no means outlaws war in general. He knows that a group, like an
animal, when it feels itself threatened in its dearest possessions or
its life, will defend itself by any available means — ^if possible, by
argument or law, and then, if these prove inadequate, by any force it
can com- mand.^® Consequently, a state in like circumstances is
justified in going to war to defend the lives and properties of its
citizens. But war is unjust if it is waged for conquest, for plunder or
land, or from the real or pre- tended desire to impose a beneficent
government upon a people unwilling to receive it.’^’‘ Preventive wars
are unjust. “Some writers have advanced a doctrine which can never be
admitted, that the law of nations authorizes one power to commence
hostilities against another whose increasing great-</p>
<p>634 the age of reason begins (chap, xxni</p>
<p>ness awakens her alarm. As a measure of expediency such a measure may
be adopted, but the principles of justice can never be advanced in its
favor. Individuals are bound to refuse to serve in wars that they judge
clearly unjust.’^®</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that a war can be just, every nation entering into it
has certain rights. It may use deceit, make reprisals, capture spoils,
take and use prisoners. But the nation has duties as well as rights. It
should de- clare war before waging it. It should honor any treaty
responsibly made for it, no matter with whom. In conquests women,
children, and old men — indeed, all noncombatants — should be spared.
Prisoners may be enslaved, but they should not be killed. Grotius
welcomes one sign of progress: Christians and Mohammedans have ceased to
enslave prisoners of their own faith.</p>
<p>It was a noble and moderate argument, despite its flaws. If natural
law IS a “dictate of right reason,” who shall determine what reason is
right? In a state this is determined by a government armed with force;
ultimately a commandment of conduct is obeyed because the legislator can
enforce it; might does not make right, but it makes law. International
law waits for an international legislature buttressed by an
international force; mean- while it will consist chiefly of modest
restraints and violable agreements accepted as convenient for the time
being by the powers concerned. To define the “law of nations” as the
customs of the most developed peoples again presupposes some authority
competent to name the most developed; but where is he? In Europe? In
China? In Islam? And can a government afford to let its citizens judge
for themselves whether a war is just or not? It can if its machinery of
indoctrination is adequate.</p>
<p>It was an illogical book, but a necessary one. A thousand unjust wars
had been fought; it was good that someone should outline measures for
mitigating incorporated homicide with mutually accepted restraints; good
that wars of conquest or plunder should be condemned; good that a plea
should be made for mercy to noncombatants and prisoners. The Thirty
Years’ War made a mockery of these distinctions and pleas; but when

<p>Richelieu, resolved to enter the Thirty Years’ War, withdrew Grotius’
pension, and the endangered author retired to Hamburg. In 1635 Oxen-
stierna sent him back to Paris as Sweden’s ambassador. But, like most
philosophers, Grotius was more at home with ideas than with men; he
allowed his dislike of Richelieu, and then of Mazarin, to determine his
diplomacy; and in 1645 he returned to the comfort of his books. Queen
Christina invited him to stay at her court as a well-pensioned scholar,
but he obtained her permission to retire to Germany. She arranged for

<p>passage to Liibeck; the vessel was driven ashore by a storm; Grotius
suffered from shock and exposure, and died at Rostock, August 29, 1645,
aged sixty-two.</p>
<p>After 267 years Holland forgave him his liberalism and raised a
statue to him (1886) in the city of his birth. In 1899 the delegates of
the United States to the International Peace Conference at The Hague
placed a silver wreath on his tomb in recognition that his book had for
a time shared in mitigating the sport of kings.</p>
<p>V. THE EPICUREAN PRIEST</p>
<p>Shall we make a final pause on our way to Descartes and contemplate
the mystery of a Catholic priest reviving the materialism of Epicurus?
It was some m easure of Europe’s mental development that the Greek
philoso - pher of pleasure, whose name had been for centuries a synonym
for atheist, should now, in the spreading distaste for Aristotle, come
into honor at the hands of a pious and irreproachable vegetarian who
died from fasting too rigorously in Lent.</p>
<p>Pierre Gassendi began as a peasant’s son near Digne in Provence. He
showed so sharp and avid a mind that at the age of sixteen he was
appointed teacher of “rhetoric” (literature), and at twenty -five
professor of philoso- phy in the University of Aix. He took holy orders
and became a canon and provost of the cathedral at Digne. By that time
he had already begotten a passionate book of “paradoxical exercises”
against Aristotle. Most of these he burned on the advice of friends, but
the parts that he published in 1624 supported the Copernican astronomy,
the atomism of Lucretius, and the moral philosophy of Epicurus. Here was
a crying invitation to martyrdom, but Pierre was so amiable a youth, so
modest in conduct, so regular in his religious duties, that nobody seems
to have thought of burn- ing him. Throughout his life he professed the
doctrine of the “two truths” — that the conclusions apparently compelled
by reason could be accepted</p>
<p>At the invitation of Descartes’ friend Mcrsenne he proposed some
power - ful objections to the Cartesian philosophy; let us defer them.
In 1645 he took the chair of mathematics at the College Royal in Paris;
but soon he fell sick with a lung ailment, and he returned to the
sunnier climate of Digne. There he wrote his major works, all around
Epicurus: De vita, moribus, et doctrina Epicuri ( 1 647 ) ; De vita,
moribus, et placitis Epicuri (1649); and a 1,600-page double-column
Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri (1649).</p>
<p>636</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xxni</p>
<p>While continuing to affirm his Catholic faith, Gassendi expounded to
the Latin-reading world the philosophy of Epicurus and Lucretius —</p>
<p>materialism, atomism, and the legitimacy of happiness. The “first
cause” of all things is God; but after that initial push everything
proceeded by its own inherent forces and laws. All knowledge comes from
the senses and is of individual entities; “universals” or general ideas
are useful tools of thought, but have no objective correlate. The soul
is doubtless im- material and immortal, but seems dependent upon the
body, and memory is apparently a function of the brain. Sensual pleasure
is not immoral if it is prudently moderate; but the least treacherous
delights are those of the mind; mathematics, for example, can cause
transports of joy. Gassendi himself, of course, was an Epicurean, not an
epicurean; i.e., he accepted the philosophy of Epicurus, but he was not
an addict of sensual pleasure; on the contrary, he led an extremely
abstemious life. Attacked by fever after too long a fast, he was
finished by his physicians through thirteen bloodlettings (1655).</p>
<p>Moliere and Cyrano de Bergerac were among his disciples at Paris;</p>
<p>Fontenelle, Saint-Evremond, and Ninon de Lenclos accepted his
philosophy without his theology; Hobbes profited from talks with him;
Locke may have taken from him some elements of sensationalist psychology
through Gassendi’s pupil and Locke’s friend, Francois Bernier, who
published an AbrSge de la philosophie de Gassendi in 1678. Newton
preferred the atoms of Gassendi to the corpuscles of Descartes, and
found in the Provengal priest an inkling of gravitation.’^’ In the
eighteenth century the latent materialism in Gassendi, and his emphasis
on science and experience as against the logic of Aristotle or the
metaphysics of Descartes, gave him a greater influence among the
philosophes than any other French thinker but Descartes. What is it,
then, that made Descartes for a century the fountain- head of an
engulfing stream in modern philosophy?</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>RENE DESCARTES: I596-165O</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, he had a Jesuit education, which has been the starting
point and whetstone of French heretics from Descartes through Voltaire
to Renan and Anatole France; “In the Temple were forged the hammers
which destroy ed the Temple.”’®</p>
<p>He was born at La Haye in Touraine. His mother died of tuberculosis a
few days later; he inherited the disease from her; as an infant he was
so pale and weak and coughed so pitifully that the physician offered no
hope of saving him. A nurse would not give him up as lost; she gave him
the warmth and nourishment of her body. He came back to life, and
perhaps</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>637</p>
<p>for that reason he was called Rene — Renatus — reborn. His father was
a prosperous lawyer, a councilor of the Parlement of Rennes, who at his
death left his son an income of six thousand francs per year.</p>
<p>At the age of eight he was entered in the Jesuit College of La
Fleche, which, says an ardent freethinker and famous mathematician,
“seems to have given him a much better grounding in mathematics than he
could have got at most universities at that time.”^” His teachers
recognized his physical weakness and mental alertness. They allowed him
to remain in bed beyond rising hours and noted that he used the time to
devour one book after another. In all his metaphysical wanderings he
never lost his admiration for the Jesuits, and in their turn they took
his doubts with paternal indulgence.</p>
<p>At seventeen he went to Paris to sow wild oats; he found that he had
none to sow, being as yet indifferent to women; but as a devoted mathe-
matician he took to gambling, figuring that he could break the casino
bank. He went on to the University of Poitiers, where he received
degrees in civil and canon law. Having gained health and strength, he
amazed his friends by enlisting in the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau
(1618). When the Thirty Years’ War gathered impetus, he joined the forc
es of Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria; an uncertain tradition pictures him
as having taken part in the battle of the White Mountain.</p>
<p>Amid these campaigns, and especially in the long months when winter
interrupted slaughter, Descartes continued his studies, especially of
mathe- matics. One day (November 10, 1619), at Neuburg (near Ulm in
Ba-</p>
<p>varia), he escaped the cold by shutting himself up in a “stove”
(probably an especially heated room). There, he tells us, he had three
visions or dreams, in which he saw flashes of light and heard thunder;
it seemed to him that some divine spirit was revealing to him a new
philosophy. When he emerged from that “stove” he had (he assures us)
formulated analytical geometry, and had conceived the idea of applying
the mathematical method to philosophy.*®</p>
<p>He returned to France in 1622, arranged his finances, and set out
again on travels. He spent almost a year in Italy: went (some say on
foot) from Venice to Loreto, paid his tribute to the Virgin, saw Rome in
the 1625 jubilee, passed through Florence, did not visit Galileo, and
came back to Paris. There and in the countryside he pursued scientific
studies. He accompanied the mathematician and military engineer Gerard
Desargues to the siege of La Rochelle (1628). Later in that year he
moved to Holland; and barring some visits to France for business
purposes, he spent nearly all the remainder of his life in the United
Provinces.</p>
<p>We do not know why he left Fran ce. Possibly, “having shown forth”
his “reasons for doubting many things,”®^ he feared accusations of
heresy;</p>
<p>638</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>and yet he had many ecclesiastical friends there, like Mersenne and
Berulle. Perhaps he sought to avoid friends as well as enemies, hoping
to find in an alien land the social (but not intellectual) isolation in
which he could give form to the philosophy that was seething within him.
He disliked the bustle and prattle of Paris, but did not mind the busy
traffic — soft-pedaled by canals — of Amsterdam; there, “in the crowded
throng of a great and very active people,” he says, he could “live as
solitary and retired as in deserts the most remote.”®* It may have been
to conceal him self still further that he changed his habitat
twenty-four times in the next twenty years — from Franeker to Amsterdam
to Deventer to Amsterdam to Utrecht to Leiden, but usually near a
university or a library. His income allowed him to live comfortably in a
small chateau, with several servants. He avoided marriage, but took a
mistress (1634), who bore him a daughter. We are pleased to hear that
when this daughter died at the age of five, Descartes wept humanly. We
should err if we thought of him as coldly unconcerned with mundane
affairs. We shall find him justifying many of the passions that
moralists normally condemn. He had some himself, being subject to pride,
anger, and vanity.*®</p>
<p>It took a proud spirit to dare his scope. Consider what he undertook:
mathematics, physics, astronomy, anatomy, physiology, psychology, meta-
physics, epistemology, ethics, theology; who would venture today on such
a circumnavigation? For this he coveted seclusion, made experiments,
equations, diagrams, weighed his chances of escaping or appeasing the
Inquisition, and sought to give mathematical method to his philosophy,
and philosophical method to his life.</p>
<p>Where should he commence? In the epochal Discours de la methode* he
announced a first principle that in itself could have brought the world
of authority down upon his head; all the more so since the essay was
written in readily intelligible French, and in an animated, captivating,
first- person style; here were many revolutions! He would begin, he
said, by rejecting all doctrines and dogmas, putting aside all
authorities, especially of tile philosophus, the philosopher, Aristotle;
he would start with a clean slate and doubt everything — de omnibus
dubitandum. “The chief cause of our errors is to be found in the
prejudices of our childhood®* . . . principles of which I allowed myself
in youth to be persuaded without having in- quired into their
truth.”®®</p>
<p>But if he doubted everything, how could he proceed? In love with</p>
<p>mathematics, above all with geometry, which his own genius was trans-
forming, he aspired to find, after his initial and universal doubt, some
fact which would be admitted as generally and readily as the axioms

<p>Euclid. “Archimedes, in order that he might draw the terrestrial
globe out of its place and transport it elsewhere, demanded that only
one point should be fixed and immovable; in the same way I shall have
the right to conceive high hopes if I am happy enough to discover one
thing only which is certain and indisputable.”®* He hit upon it
exultingly: Je pense, done je sun, Cogito ergo sum, “I think, therefore
I am”®^ — ^the most famous sentence in philosophy.* It was intended not
as a syllogism but as an im- mediate and irrefragable experience, the
clearest and most distinct idea that we can ever have. Other ideas
should be considered “true” in proportion as they approach this primal
intuition — this direct perception — ^in distinct- ness and clarity.
Descartes’ new “method” in philosophy, his novum</p>
<p>organum, was to analyze complex conceptions into their constituents
until the irreducible elements are simple, clear, distinct ideas, and to
show that all such basic ideas can be derived from, or can depend upon,
the primary con- sciousness of a being that it thinks. Conversely, we
should try to deduce from this primary perception all the fundamental
principles of philosophy.</p>
<p>It was again a revolution in philosophy that Descartes took as his
start- ing point not external objects supposedly known but the conscious
self. The Renaissance had rediscovered the individual; Descartes made
him the hitching post of his philosophy. “I see clearly that there is
nothing w hich is easier for me to know than my own mind.”®® If we begin
with matter and rise through levels of organic life to man, we shall be
tempted by the logic of continuity to interpret mind as material. But
matter is known to us only through mind; only mind is known directly.
Here begins modern idea-lism, not as ideal-ism in an ethical sense, but
as a philosophy that starts with the immediate fact of ideas, rather
than with things known through ideas. Descartes sets the epistemological
theme of modern European philosophy: “No more useful inquiry can be
proposed than that which seeks to determine the nature and scope of
human knowledge.”®® Now for three centuries philosophy would wonder if
the “external world” exis ts except as idea.</p>
<p>For just as it is difiicult to pass from body to mind with any
theory</p>
<p>that does justice both to the apparently material source and agency
of sensations and to the apparently immaterial nature of ideas, so
Descartes, having begun with the self, finds it difficult to pass from
mind to things. How does the mind know that the sensations that seem to
attest an ex- ternal world are anything more than its own states? How
can it trust the senses, which so often deceive us, or the mental images
that are just as vivid when “false” in sleep as when “true” in the
day?</p>
<p>To escape from this “solipsistic” prison of the self, Descartes
appeals</p>
<ul>
<li>St. Augustine had used the same starting point in seeking to refute
the pagan skeptics, who profe ssed to doubt everything. But who “doubts
that he lives and thinks?” he asked. “For if he doubts, he lives.”®®
Montaigne used the same argument against the Pyrrhonists in his
“Apologie de Raimond Sebond.” Descartes had read Montaigne.</li>
</ul>
<p>640 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XXIH</p>
<p>to God, who surely would not make our whole sensory equipment a
deception. But when did God come into this system that began so boldly
by doubting all received beliefs? Descartes cannot prove the existence
of God from evidences of design in the external world, for he has not
yet shown the existence of that world. So Descartes evolves God out of
the knowing self, very much as Anselm had done in the “ontological
proof” six centuries before. I have, he says, a conception of a perfect
being, omnis- cient, omnipotent, necessary, and eternal. But that which
exists is more nearly perfect than that which does not; therefore a
perfect being must in- clude existence among his attributes. And who
could have put that idea into me but God Himself? “It is not possible
that … I should have in my - self the idea of a God if God did not
veritably exist.”®^ For if God were a deceiver He would not be perfect.
Therefore he does not deceive us when we have clear and distinct ideas,
nor when He allows our senses to reveal to us an external world. “I do
not see how He could be defended from the accusation of deceit if these
ideas were produced by causes other than corporeal objects. Hence we
must allow that corporeal things exist.”®* So the gap between mind and
matter, subject and object, is marvelously closed, and Descartes, by the
help of God, becomes a real-ist. Science itself — our confident belief
in a logical, orderly, law-abiding, calculable universe — be- comes
possible only because God exists and cannot lie.</p>
<p>As we follow Descartes we see the infant Age of Reason recoiling
in</p>
<p>fear from the hazards of thought and seeking to re-enter the warm
womb of faith. The Meditationes was reassuringly entitled The
Meditations of Rene Descartes on First Philosophy, in Which the
Existence of God and the Immortality of the Soul Are Demonstrated; and
the book was dedicated to “the very sage and illustrious dean of the
Sacred Faculty of Theology of Paris” — ^i.e., the Sorbonne. The dean
accepted the dedication, but in 1662 the volume was placed on the Index
of Prohibited Books “until it is corrected.” It began on the same brave
note as the Discours: “Today . . . since I have procured for myself an
assured leisure in a peaceful retreat, I shall at last freely and
seriously address myself to the general upheaval of all my former
opinions.”®® He throws them out the window and then lets them in at the
door. And not only the belief in a just and omnipotent God, but also in
a human will free amid universal mechanism, and a soul immortal despite
its apparent dependence upon mortal flesh. Yield as we must to the logic
of an unbreakable chain of cause and effect in the world of matter and
body, the freedom of our wills is one of those innate ideas which are so
clear and distinct, so vivid and immediate, that no one ever doubts them
in practice, however much he may play with them in abstract
theory.®*</p>

<p>of mathematics — all these are innate; that is, the soul derives them
not from sensation or experience but from its own essence and
rationality. (Here Locke would demur and Kant would applaud.) However,
these innate ideas may remain unconscious until experience startles them
into conscious form. The soul, then, is not a product of experience, but
its active and originative partner in the production of thought. This
“rational soul” — the ability to reason — is clearly immaterial; its
ideas have no length, breadth, position, weight, or any other of the
qualities that belong to matter.^^ “This ‘me,’ that is to say, the soul
by which I am what I am, is essentially distinct from the body, and is
even easier to know than the latter.”®® Therefore</p>
<p>Were these orthodox conclusions sincere, or were they protective
colora- tion.^ Was Descartes so anxious to pursue his scientific studies
in un- persecuted peace that he exuded metaphysics like some befuddling
mist to hamper birds of prey? We cannot say. It is possible for a man to
be a good scientist — at least in physics, chemistry, and astronomy, if
not in biology — and at the same time accept the basic doctrines of
Christianity. In one passage Descartes affirmed that reason “does not
prevent us from believing matters that have been divinely revealed as
being more certain than our sur est knowledge.”®*^ His correspondence
with Princess Palatine</p>
<p>And yet the last decade of his life was dedicated to science. He
turned his rooms into a laboratory and made experiments in physics and
phys- iology. When a visitor asked to see his library Descartes pointed
to a quarter of veal that he was dissecting.®® At times he spoke like
Bacon of the great practical benefits that would accrue to mankind when
science had made men “the masters and possessors of nature.”^®® His
subjective emphasis and his confidence in deduction often led him to
dubious con- clusions, but he worked creatively in several sciences. He
insisted that science should replace the vague and qualitative
abstractions of medieval physics with quantitative explanations in
mathematical form. We have noted his development of analytical geometry
and his adumbration of in- finitesimal calculus. He solved the problems
of doubling a cube and tri- secting an angle. He established the use of
the first letters of the alphabet to represent known, and of the last
letters to represent unknown,</p>
<p>quantities. He seems to have discovered the law of refraction
inde-</p>
<p>pendently of Snell. He studied fruitfully great forces exerted by
small means, as by the pulley, the wedge, the lever, the vise, and the
wheel, and he formulated laws of inertia, impact, and impetus. He may

altitude,<sup>®</sup> though he was mistaken in declaring that a vacuum

vortices of particles whirling about it in spherical layers — a
conception not unlike the present theory of magnetic fields. In optics
he correctly calculated the angle of refraction; he analyzed the changes
to which light is subjected by the crystalline lens of the eye; he
solved the problem of correcting spherical aberration in telescopes, and
designed lenses with elliptical or hyperbolic curvature free from such
aberration.^®*</p>
<p>He dissected and anatomically described a foetus. He dissected (he
tells us) “the heads of various animals in order to ascertain in what
memory, imagination, etc., consist.”<sup>®</sup> He made experiments in
reflex action, and ex - plained the mechanism by which the eye winks at
the approach of a blow.^®* He developed a theory of the emotions
resembling that of William James and Carl Lange: the external cause of
the emotion (e/g., our sight of a dangerous animal) automatically and
simultaneously generates a responsive action (flight) and the
corresponding emotion (fear); the emotion is the accompaniment, not the
cause, of the action. The passions are rooted in physiology and should
be studied and explained as mechanical operations. They are not in
themselves bad, for they are the wind in our sails; but when not
moderated by reason they can enslave and ruin a personality.</p>
<p>The whole universe, except God and the rational soul, may be viewed
as mechanical. Remembering Galileo and the Inquisition, Descartes is
careful to present the idea as hypothetical: assuming that God has
created matter and endowed it with motion, we can imagine the world
evolving thereafter by the laws of mechanics, without interference. The
natural movement of material particles, in a universe without a vacuum,
would take a circular form, resulting in diverse vortices or whirlpools
of motion. The sun, the planets, and the stars may have been formed by
the con- centration of particles at the centers of these vortices. Just
as every body is surrounded by a whirl of fine atoms — ^which explains
cohesion and at- traction — so each planet is enclosed in a vortex of
particles that holds its satellites in orbit. The sun is the center of a
vast vortex in which the planets are swept around it in circles. It was
an ingenious theory, but it fell apart when Kepler proved that the
planetary orbits are elliptical.</p>
<p>Descartes proposed that if our knowledge were complete we should be
able to r^uce not only astronomy and physics and chemistry, but all the
operations of life, except reason itself, to mechanical laws.
Respiration, digestion, even sensation, are mechanical; see how
beneficently this principle worked in Harvey’s discovery of the
circulation of the blood. Descartes confidently applied the mechanical
conception to all the operations of animals, for he refused to credit
them with the power of reasoning. He may have felt religiously compelled
to do this injustice to animals; for he</p>
<p>CHAP, xxm)</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>643</p>
<p>had based the immortality of the soul upon the immateriality of the
rational mind, and if animals too had such minds they too would be
immortal — which might be an inconvenience, if not to dog lovers, at
least to theo- logians.</p>
<p>But if the human body is a material machine, how can the immaterial
mind act upon it, or govern it by so unmechanical a power as free will?
At this point Descartes lost his confidence; he answered desperately
that God arranges the interaction of body and mind in mysterious ways,
beyond our finite understanding. Perhaps, he suggested, the mind acts
upon the body through the pineal gland, which is appropriately situated
at the middle base of the brain.</p>
<p>The rashest act in Descartes’ life was his request to Mersenne to
send advance copies of the Meditationes to various thinkers with an
invitation to submit criticisms. Gassendi, in reply, demolished
Descartes’ contentions with Gallic courtesy;^®® the priest was not
convinced by the ontological argument for the existence of God. Hobbes
objected that Descartes had not proved the mind’s independence of matter
and the brain. Privately (according to Aubrey) Hobbes “was wont to say
that had Descartes kept himself wholly to geometry … he had been the
best geometer in the world, but that his head did not lie for
philosophy.”^®*^ Huygens agreed with Hobbes, and thought that Descartes
had woven a romance out of metaphysical webs.</p>
<p>It is simple now, profiting from three centuries of discussion, to
point out weaknesses in this brave first modern “system” of philosophy.
The idea of reducing philosophy to geometrical form condemned Descartes
to a deductive method in which, despite his experiments, he relied too
reck- lessly on his flair for reasoning. To make the clarity,
distinctness, vividness, and immediacy of an idea the test of its truth
was suicidal, for on that basis who would dare deny the revolution of
the sun around the earth? To argue that God exists because we have a
clear and distinct idea of a perfect and infinite being (do we?), and
then to argue that clear and distinct ideas are trustworthy because God
would not deceive us, is a form of reasoning as circular and dubious as
Descartes’ planetary orbits. This philosophy is dripping with the
medieval Scholastic conceptions that it proposed to re- ject.
Montaigne’s doubt was more basic and lasting than that of Descartes, who
merely removed traditional nonsense to make room for his own.</p>
<p>Even so there remained enough in his science, if not in his
metaphysics, to make him fear persecution. His theory of universal
mechanism left miracles and free will in a parlous state despite his
professions of orthodox belief. Wh en he heard of Galileo’s condemnation
(June 1633) he put aside the major work, Le Monde ^ in which he had
planned to unite all his scientific work and results; and he wrote sadly
to Mersenne:</p>
<p>&lt;544</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>This has so strongly affected me that I have almost resolved to burn
all my ms., or at least to show it to no one. … If it 〔the motion
of</p>
<p>the earth〕 is false, all the principles of my philosophy 〔of
world</p>
<p>mechanism〕 are erroneous, since they mutually support one
another.</p>
<p>. . . But on no account will I publish anything that contains a
word</p>
<p>that might displease the Church.^®®</p>
<p>At his death only a few fragments of Le Monde could be found.</p>
<p>The attack came not (in his lifetime) from the Roman Church but from
the Calvinist theologians in the universities of Utrecht and Leiden.
They considered his defense of free will as a heresy dangerous to
predestinarian- ism, and they saw in his mechanical cosmogony a descent
to within a step of atheism. If the universe could get along with merely
an initial impetus from God, it was only a matter of time till God would
be absolved from that inaugural push. In 1641, when a Utrecht professor
adopted the Cartesian system, the rector of the university, Gisbert
Voetius, persuaded the city magistrates to ban the new philosophy.
Descartes retorted with an attack upon Voetius, who answered bitterly
and was rebutted by Des- cartes. The magistrates summoned the
philosopher to appear before them (1643). He refused to come; judgment
was passed against him, but his friends at The Hague intervened, and the
magistrates contented themselves with a decree forbidding any further
public argument either for or against Descartes’ ideas.</p>
<p>He was consoled by the friendship of Princess Elizabeth, who with her
mother, Electress Palatine Elizabeth, the dethroned Queen of Bohemia,
was living at The Hague. The Princess was nineteen when the Discours ap-
peared (1637); she read it with delighted surprise that philosophy could
be so intelligible; and Descartes, meeting her, saw with delight that
meta- physics could be beautiful. He dedicated to her the Principia
philosophiae in terms of enraptured flattery. She ended as an abbess in
Westphalia (1680).</p>
<p>Not quite so happy in Holland as before, Descartes now frequently</p>
<p>visited France (1644, 1647, 1648). His patriotism was stirred by a
pension from the new government of Louis XIV (1646). He angled for a
post in the administration, but the approach of civil war — the Fronde —
frightened him back to Holland. In February 1649 he received an
invitation from Queen Christina of Sweden to come and teach her
philosophy. He hesi- tated, but was attracted by her letters, which
revealed in excellent French an eager mind already won to the “dear
delight.” She sent an admiral to coax him, then a warship to fetch him.
He yielded, and in September he sailed from Amsterdam for Stockholm.</p>
<p>He was received with every honor, but was alarmed to find that
the</p>

<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>645</p>
<p>Queen wished to be instructed three times a week, always at five
o’clock in the morning; Descartes had long been accustomed to lie late
in bed. For two months he conformed to the royal schedule, walking
through the winter dawn and snow from his rooms to the Queen’s library.
On Feb - ruary I, 1650, he caught a cold, which became pneumonia; on
February 1 1 he died, after receiving the last rites of the Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>He had taken as a motto Bene vixit qui bene latuit — “He has lived
well who has hidden well”; but his fame had become international many
years before his death. The universities rejected his philosophy, and
the clergy sniffed heresy in his piety; but scientists applauded his
mathematics and physics, and the fashionable world in Paris took up with
pleasure the works that he had written in lucid and engaging French.
Moliere laughed at the femmes savantes who bandied vortices in salo ns
but “could not endure a vacuum.” The Jesuits had heretofore been
tolerant of their brilliant pupil; they had silenced one of their number
who had attacked him;^®* but after 1640 they withdrew their protection,
and in 1663 they were instrumental in having his works placed on the
Index. Bossuet and Fenelon welcomed Des- cartes’ proofs of the basic
Christian beliefs, but saw danger to faith in rest - ing it on reason.
Pascal denounced the reliance on reason as a reed shaken by the
wind.</p>
<p>It was precisely this Cartesian trust in reason that stirred the mind
of Europe. Fontenelle summed up the matter: “It is Descartes . . . who
gave us a new method of reasoning, much more admirable than his
philosophy itself, in which a large part is false or very doubtful
according to the very rules that he has taught us.”^^® The Cartesian
doubt did for France — for the Continent in general — what Bacon had
done for England: it freed philosophy from the barnacles of time and set
it bravely sailing the open sea, even if, in Descartes, it soon returned
to safe and familiar ports. Not that there was any immediate victory for
reason; through France’s most brilliant age, the grand si^cle of Louis
XIV, tradition and Scripture more than held their own; it was the epoch
of Port-Royal, Pascal, and Bossuet rather than of Descartes’ inheritors.
But in Holland that same period was the age of Spinoza and Bayle, and in
England it was the time of Hobbes and Locke. The seed was sprouting.</p>
<p>Descartes’ work had so me influence on French literature and art. His
style was a refreshing innovation. Here was philosophy in the
vernacular, dangerously open to all, and seldom had a philosopher spoken
with such charming intimacy, recounting the adventures of reason as
vividly as Froissart recounting an exploit in chivalry. That brief and
digestible</p>
<p>Discours de la methode was not only a masterpiece of French prose; it
set the tone, both in its language and in its ideas, for the classic age
in France — for order, intelligence, and moderation in letters and arts,
in</p>
<p>646</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>manners and speech. Its emphasis on clear and distinct ideas suited
the Gallic mind; its exaltation of reason became in Boileau the first
principle of the classic style:</p>
<p>Aimez done la raison; que toujours vos ecrits</p>
<p>Empruntent (Telle seule et leur lustre et leur prix.</p>
<p>(“Love reason, then; let your writings ever derive from it alone
their luster and their worth.”) For two centuries the French dr ama
became the rhet- oric of reason competing with the turbulence of
passion. Perhaps French poetry suffered from Descartes: his mood and his
mechanisms left small scope for imagination or feeling. After him the
ebullient chaos of Rabelais, the formless meandering of Montaigne, even
the violent disorders of the Religious Wars, gave way to the rational
arguments of Corneille, the rigid unities of Racine, the logical piety
of Bossuet, the law and order, form and manners, of the monarchy and the
court under Louis XIV. Unwittingly Descartes had shared in inaugurating
a new style in French life as well as in philosophy.</p>
<p>His influence in philosophy was probably greater than that of any
other modern thinker before Kant. Malebranche stemmed from him. Spinoza
schooled himself in the Cartesian logic and found its weaknesses in
expound- ing it. He imitated the Discours in his autobiographical
fragment On the Improvement of the Understanding; he adopted the
geometrical ideal of philosophy in his Ethics; he based his discussion
of “human bondage” on Descartes’ Traite des passions. The idealistic
tradition in modern philosophy from Berkeley to Fichte started with the
Cartesian emphasis on thought as the only reality directly known, just
as the empirical tradition flowed from Hobbes to Spencer. But Descartes
offered an antidote to idealism — ^the con- ception of an objective
world completely mechanical. His attempt to under- stand organic as well
as inorganic operations in mechanical terms gave a reckless but fruitful
impetus to biology and physiology; and his mechanical analysis of
sensation, imagination, memory, and volition became a major source of
modern psychology. After the seventeenth century in France had
buttressed orthodoxy with Descartes, the Enlightenment of the eight-
eenth century found rich roots in his methodical doubt, his trust in
reason, his interpretation of all animal life in the same terms as
physics and chem- istry.^^^ All the upholding pride of the expatriated
Frenchman justified itself in his proliferating influence upon the mind
of France.</p>
<p>The Great Debate between reason and faith was taking conscious form,
but its modern history had only begun. Looking back over those ninety
years from 1558 to 1648, from Elizabeth to Richelieu, from
Shakespeare</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIll)</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY REBORN</p>
<p>647</p>
<p>to Descartes, we perceive that the absorbing issues were still within
the confines of Christianity, between competing varieties of religious
faith based upon a Bible that all accepted as the word of God. Only in
stray voices was there a suggestion that Christianity itself might be
put on trial, and that philosophy might soon reject all forms of
supernatural belief.</p>
<p>After these first steps in the conflict Catholicism remained supreme
in Spain and Portugal, where the Inquisition still spread its terror and
pall. In Italy the old religion had taken a humaner form, beautifying
life with art and anointing mortality with hope. France compromised:
Christianity survived vigorous and fruitful among the people. Catholic
or Huguenot, while the upper classes frolicked with doubt, postponing
piety to the eve of death. The Netherlands made a geographical
compromise: the southern provinces kept Catholicism, while Calvinism
triumphed in the north. In Germany Protestantism was saved by a French
cardinal; but Bavaria and Austria were confirmed in their former
allegiance, while Hungary and Bohemia were recaptured for the papacy. In
Scandinavia Protestantism became the law of the land, but the Queen of
Sweden preferred the ceremo- nies of Rome. In England Elizabeth proposed
a gracious union of Roman ritual with national liberty, but English
Protestantism, dividing into a swarm of sects, displayed its vitality
and risked its life.</p>
<p>Amid this clash of armies and creeds the International of Science was
laboring to lessen superstition and fear. It was inventing or improving
the microscope, the telescope, the thermometer, and the barometer. It
was de- vising the logarithmic and decimal systems, reforming the
calendar, and developing analytical geometry; it was already dreaming of
reducing all reality to an algebraic equation. Tycho Brahe had made the
patiently re- peated observations that enabled Kepler to formulate those
laws of plane- tary motion which were to illuminate Newton’s vision of
one universal law. Galileo was revealing new and vaster worlds through
his ever larger telescopes, and was dramatizing the conflict of science
and theology in the halls of the Inquisition. In philosophy Giordano
Bruno was letting himself be burned to death in the attempt to
reconceive deity and the cosmos in terms worthy of Copernicus; Francis
Bacon, summoning the wits to</p>
<p>science, was mapping its tasks for centuries to come; and Descartes,
with his universal doubt, was giving another cue to the Age of Reason.
Morals and manners were molded by the vicissitudes of belief. Literature
itself was touched by the conflict, and the ideas of philosophers echoed
in the poetry of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Donne. Soon all the wars and
revolutions of the rival states would sink into minor significance
compared with that mounting, spreading contest between faith and reason
which was to agitate and transform the mind of Europe, perhaps of the
world.</p>
