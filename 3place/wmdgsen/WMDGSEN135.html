<h4 id="chapter-xvii-epicurean-rome">CHAPTER XVII Epicurean Rome</h4>
<p>30 B.C.-A.D. 96</p>
<p>I. THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>1 ET us enter these dwellings, temples, theaters, and baths, and see
how j these Romans lived; we shall find them more interesting than their
art. We must at the outset recall that by Nero’s time they were only
geographi - cally Roman. The conditions that Augustus had failed to
check — celibacy, childlessness, abortion, and infanticide among the
older stocks, manumission and comparative fertility among the new — had
transformed the racial char- acter, the moral temper, even the
physiognomy, of the Roman people.</p>
<p>Once the Romans had been precipitated into parentage by the impetus
of sex, and lured to it by anxiety for the post-mortem care of their
graves; now the upper and middle classes had learned to separate sex
from parentage, and were skeptical about the afterworld. Once the
rearing of children had been an obligation of honor to the state,
enforced by public opinion; now it seemed absurd to demand more births
in a city crowded to the point of redolence. On the contrary, wealthy
bachelors and childless husbands con- tinued to be courted by sycophants
longing for legacies. “Nothing,” said Juvenal, “will so endear you to
your friends as a barren wife.” 1 “Crotona,”</p>
<p>364 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVn</p>
<p>might have as many lovers as she pleased. 5 Contraception was
practiced in both its mechanical and chemical forms.® If these methods
failed there were many ways of procuring abortion. Philosophers and the
law condemned it, but the fi nest families practiced it. “Poor women,”
says Juvenal, “endure the perils of childbirth, and all the troubles of
nursing… but how often does a gilded bed harbor a pregnant woman? So
great is the skill, so powerful the drugs, of the abortionist!”
Nevertheless, he tells the husband, “rejoice; give her the potion… for
were she to bear the child you might find</p>
<p>yourself the father of an Ethiopian.” 7 In so enlightened a society
infanticide was rare.*</p>
<p>The infertility of the moneyed classes was so offset by immigration
and the fecundity of the poor that the population of Rome and the Empire
continued to grow. Beloch estimated it at 800,000 for the Rome of the
early Empire, Gibbon at 1,200,000, Marquardt at 1,600, 000. f Beloch
com- puted the population of the Empire at 54,000,000, Gibbon at
i20,ooo,ooo. u The aristocracy was as numerous as before, but it was
almost wholly altered in origin. We hear no more of the Aemilii,
Claudii, Fabii, Valerii; only the Comelii remained of the proud clans
that, as late as Caesar, had strutted their Rome. Some had vanished
through war or political execution; others had faded out through family
limitation, physiological degeneration, or an im- poverishment that had
lowered them into the plebeian mass. Their places had been taken by
Roman businessmen, Italian municipal dignitaries, and provincial nobles.
In a.d. 56 a senator declared that “most of the knights, and many of the
senators, were descendants of slaves.” 12 After a generation or two the
new optimates adopted the ways of their predecessors, had fewer children
and more luxuries, and surrendered to inundation from the East.</p>
<p>First had come the Greeks — not so much from the mainland as from
Cyrenaica, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor. They were eager, clever, facile
semi-Orientals; many of them small traders or import merchants; some of
them scientists, writers, teachers, artists, physicians, musicians,
actors; some sincerely, some venally, devoted to philosophy; some of
them able ad- ministrators and financiers, many of them without moral
scruple, nearly all without religious belief. The majority had come as
slaves and were not an ideal selection; freed, they kept their external
servility, their internal hatred and scorn of the rich Roman who lived
intellectually on the cultural leavings of ancient Hellas. The streets
of the capital were now noisy with restless</p>
<p>• Sometimes, in the first century, girls or illegitimate children
were exposed, usually at the and save</p>
<p>he infants found there. 10 The abandonment of unwanted babies,
however, is a custom to be found in all but the most uncivilized
societies,</p>
<p>In 1937 the population of Rome was 1,178,000.</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>3 6 voluble Greeks; the Greek language was more often heard there
than the Latin; if one wished to be read by all classes he had to write
in Greek. Nearly all the early Christians in Rome spoke Greek; so did
the Syrians, the Egyptians, and the Jews. A large colony of Egyptians —
traders, artisans, artists — lived in the Field of Mars. Syrians, thin,
affable, shrewd, were every- where in the capital, busy with trade,
handicrafts, secretarial work, finance, and chicanery.</p>
<p>The Jews were already in Caesar’s time a substantial element in the
popu - lation of the capital. A few had come as early as 140 b.c.; 13
many had been brought to Rome as war captives after Pompey’s campaign of
63 b.c. They were rapidly emancipated, partly by their industry and
thrift, partly be- cause their strict adherence to their religious
customs was inconvenient for their masters. By 59 b.c. there were so
many Jewish citizens in the assem- blies that Cicero represented
opposition to them as political temerity. 14 In general the republican
party was hostile to the Jews, the populates and the emperors were
friendly. 15 # By the end of the first century they numbered some 20,000
in the capital. 18 They lived mostly on the west side of the Tiber,
where they suffered periodically from the floods. They worked on the
near-by docks, engaged in handicrafts and retail business, and peddled
goods through the city. There were some rich men among them, but only a
few great merchants; Syrians and Greeks dominated international
commerce. Synagogues were numerous in Rome, and each had its school, its
scribes, and its gerousia, or senate of elders. 19 The separatism of the
Jews, their scorn of polytheism and image worship, the severity of their
morals, their refusal to attend the theaters or the games, their strange
customs and cere- monies, their poverty and resultant uncleanliness, led
to the usual racial antagonisms. Juvenal denounced their fertility’’,
Tacitus their monotheism, Ammianus Marcellinus their fondness for
garlic. 20 Bad feeling was heightened by the bloody capture of
Jerusalem, and the procession of Jewish captives and sacred spoils
featured in the triumph of Titus and in the reliefs on his arch.
Vespasian heaped insult upon injury by ordering that the half shekel
paid annually by the Jews of the Dispersion for the upkeep of the Temple
at Jerusalem should henceforth be contributed yearly to the rebuilding
of</p>

<li>They supported Caesar consistently and were in turn protected by
him. Augustus followed suit; but Tiberius, hostile to all foreign
faiths, conscripted 4000 of them for almost suicidal soldiering in
Sardinia, and expelled the rest from Rome (a.d. 19). 10 Twelve years
later, con- vinced that he had been misled in this matter by Sejanus, he
withdrew his edict and ordered that the Jews should be unmolested in the
practice of their religion and the pursuit of their customs. 17 Caligula
protected them in Rome and oppressed them abroad. Claudius exiled some
because of riots, but by a general edict (42 ) confirmed the right of
the Jews throughout the Empire to live by their own laws. In 94 Domitian
banished the Jews of Rome to the valley of Egeria; in 96 Nerva brought
them back, restored their civic rights, and allowed them a gen- eration
of peace.</li>

<p>Rome. Nevertheless, many educated Romans admired Jewish monotheism;
some were converted to Judaism, and several, even of high family,
observed the Jewish Sabbath as a day of worship and rest. 21</p>
<p>If we add to the Greeks, the Syrians, the Egyptians; and the Jews
some Numidians, Nubians, and Ethiopians from Africa; a few Arabs,
Parthians, Cappadocians, Armenians, Phrygians, and Bithynians from Asia;
powerful “barbarians” fro m Dalmatia, Thrace, Dacia, and Germany;
mustachioed nobles from Gaul, poets and peasants from Spain, and
“tattooed savages from Britain” M — we get an ethnic picture of a very
heterogeneous and cosmopolitan Rome. Martial marveled at the pliable
facility with which the courtesans of Rome readjusted their language and
their charms to so varied and polyglot a clientele. 28 Juvenal
complained that the Orontes, Syria’s great</p>
<p>There were elements of nobility in this motley crowd. It showed its
con- tempt of Nero’s mistress Poppaea when angry senators dared not
speak, and it stormed the senate house to protest the wholesale
slaughter of Pedanius Secundus’ slaves. 28 The simple virtues of the
common man were not wanting in it; the family life of the Jews was
exemplary, and the little Christian com- munities were troubling the
pleasure-mad pagan world with their piety and their decency. But most of
the inflowing peoples had literally been demor- alized by uprootage from
their native surroundings, cultures, and moral codes; years of slavery
had destroyed in them that self-respect which is the backbone of upright
conduct; and daily friction with groups of different customs had worn
away stillmore of their custom-made morality. If Rome had not engulfed
so many men of alien blood in so brief a time, if she had passed all
these newcomers through her schools instead of her slums, if she had
treated them as men with a hundred potential excellences, if she had
occasionally closed her gates to let assimiliation catch up with
infiltration, she might have gained new racial and literary vitality
from the infusion, and might have remained a Roman Rome, the voice and
citadel of the West. The task was too great. The victorious city was
doomed by the vastness and diversity of her conquests, her native blood
was diluted in the ocean of her subjects, her educated classes were
drawn down by the power of numbers to the culture of those, who had been
her slaves. Much breeding overcame good breeding; the fertile conquered
became masters in the sterile master’s house.</p>

<li>EDUCATION</li>
</ol>
<p>We do not know much of Roman childhood, but we can judge from Roman
art and epitaphs that when children came they were loved not wisely but
too well. Juvenal interrupts his wrath to write a tender passage on the
good examples we must place before our children’s eyes, the evil sights
and sounds we must keep from them, the respect that we should show them
even in the excesses of our love. 27 Favorinus, in a discourse
premimicking Rousseau, begged mothers to nurse their babes. 28 Seneca
and Plutarch spoke to the same effect, which was slight indeed;
wet-nursing was the rule in all families that could afford it, with no
evident tragedies ensuing.*</p>
<p>Early education came from the nurse, who was usually Greek. There
were fairy tales beginning, “Once upon a time a king and a queen..
Primary schooling was still entrusted to private enterprise. Rich men
often hired tutors for their children, but Quintilian, like Emerson,
warned against this as depriving the child of formative friendships and
stimulating rivalries. Ordinarily the boy and girl of the free classes
entered at the age of seven an elementary school, accom- panied each way
by a paedagogus (“child - leader”) to guard his safety and his morals.
Such schools existed everywhere in the Empire, even in small country
towns; the wall scribblings at Pompeii suggest a general literacy, and
probably education was then as widespread in the Mediterranean world as
at any time be- fore or since. Both the paedagogus and the teacher (ludi
magister y “schoolmas - ter”) were usually Greek freedmen or slaves. In
Horace’s youth and native town</p>
<p>About the age of thirteen the successful student, of either sex, was
graduated into a secondary or high school; Rome had twenty of these in
a.d. i 30. Here the scholars studied more grammar, the Greek language,
Latin and Greek litera- ture, music, astronomy, history, mythology, and
philosophy, generally through lecture-commentaries on the classic poets.
Up to this point the girls seem to have taken the same courses as the
boys, but they often sought additional instruc- tion in music and
dancing. Since the secondary teachers {grammatici) were nearly always
Greek freedmen, they naturally emphasized Greek literature and history;
Roman culture took on a Greek tint, until by the end of the second
century almost all higher education was given in Greek, and Latin
literature was swallowed up in the general Hellenic koine and culture of
the age.</p>
<p>The Roman equivalent of our college and university education was
provided in the schools of the rhetors. The Empire bristled with
rhetoricians who spoke</p>
<p>• Toys and games were much as today. Roman children played hopscotch,
tug -of-war, pitch and toss, blindman’s buff, hide -and-seek; and with
dolls, hoops, skipping ropes, hobbyhorses, and kites. Roman youth played
five distinguishable games of ball. One resembled our football, except
that (or in that) it was played rather with arms and hands than with
legs and feet. 20</p>
<p>}68 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>for their clients in court, or wrote speeches for them, or gave
public lectures, or taught their art to pupils, or did all four. Many of
them traveled from city to city, speaking on literature, philosophy, or
politics, and giving exhibitions of how to handle any subject with
oratorical skill. The younger Pliny tells of the Greek Isaeus, then
sixty-three years old:</p>
<p>He proposes several questions for discussion, gives his audience</p>
<p>liberty to call for any they please, and sometimes even to say
what</p>
<p>side of it he should defend; whereupon he rises, dons his gown, and
begins…. He introduces his theme with great propriety, his</p>
<p>narrative is clear, his controversy ingenious, his logic forcible,
and</p>
<p>his rhetoric sublime. 81</p>
<p>Such men might open a school, employ assistants, and gather a large
student body. Pupils entered about their sixteenth year, and paid fees
as high as 2000 sesterces per course. The chief subjects were oratory,
geometry, astronomy, and philosophy — which included much that is now
termed science. These con- stituted a “liberal education”— i.e., one
designed for a well-to-do freeman ( homo liber ) , who would presumably
have no physical work to perform. Petronius complained, as every
generation does, that education unfitted youth for the problems of
maturity: “The schools are to blame for the gross foolishness of our
young men, since in them they see or hear nothing at all of the affairs
of everyday life.” 82 We can only say that they gave the assi duous
student that clarity and quickness of thought which have distinguished
the legal profession in all ages, and that capacity for unscrupulous
eloquence which marked the orators of Rome. Apparently no degrees were
granted in these schools. The student might stay as long, and take as
many courses, as he liked; Aulus Gellius remained till he was
twenty-five. Women also attended, some after marriage. Those who wished
further instruction went to Athens for philosophy at its bubbling
source, to Alexandria for medicine, or to Rhodes for the last subtleties
of rhetoric. Gcero spent 000 a year maintaining his son in the
university of Athens.</p>
<p>By Vespasian’s time the schools of rhetoric had so grown in number
and influence that the wily Emperor thought it advisable to bring the
more important ones in the capital under governmental control by paying
their head professors a state salary — the highest being 100,000
sesterces ($ 10,000) a year. We do not know to how many teachers or
cities Vespasian extended this subsidy. We hear of private endowments
for higher education, such as the younger Pliny estab- lished at Comum.
83 Trajan provided scholarships for 5000 boys who had less money than
brains. By the reign of Hadrian governmental financing of secondary
schools had been adopted in many municipalities throughout the Empire,
and a pension fund had been set aside for retired teachers. Hadrian and
Antoninus exempted the leading professors of each city from taxation and
other civic burdens. Education reached its height while superstition
grew, morals declined, and literature decayed*</p>

<li>THE SEXES</li>
</ol>
<p>The moral life of youth was carefully guarded in the girl, leniently
super- vised in the young man. The Roman, like the Greek, readily
condoned the resort of men to prostitutes. The profession was legalized
and restricted; brothels ( lupanaria ) were by law kept outside the city
walls and could open only at night; prostitutes ( meretrices ) were
registered by the aediles and were required to wear the toga instead of
the stola. Some women enrolled as prostitutes to avoid the legal
penalties of detected adultery. Fees were ad- justed to bring
promiscuity within the reach of every pocketbook; we have heard of the
“quarter -of-an- as woman.” But there was now a rising number of
educated courtesans who sought to win patrons by poetry, singing, music,
dancing, and cultured conversation. One did not have to go outside the
walls to find these or other ladies of easy persuasion; Ovid assures us
that they could be met under the porticoes, at the circus, in the
theater, “as numerous as stars in the sky”; 34 and Juvenal found them in
the precincts of temples, particularly that of Isis, a goddess lenient
to love. 35 Christian authors charged that prostitution was practiced
within the cellas and between the altars of Roman temples. 30</p>
<p>Male prostitutes were also available. Condemned by law, tolerated by
custom, homosexualism flourished with Oriental abandon. “ I am stricken
with the heavy dart of love,” sings Horace— and for whom? — “for
Lyciscus, who claims in tenderness to outdo any woman”; from this
passion he can be freed “only by another flame for some fair maid or
slender youth.” 37 Mar - tial’s choicest epigrams turn upon pederasty;
and one of Juvenal’s least publishable satires represents the complaint
of a woman against this out- rageous competition. 38 Erotic poetry of
indifferent worth and gender, the Priapeia, circulated freely among
sophisticated youths and immature adults. Marriage contended bravely
with these rival outlets and, helped by anxious parents and matrimonial
brokers, managed to find at least temporary hus- bands for nearly every
girl. Unmarried women above nineteen were con- si dered “old maids,” but
they were rare. The betrothed couple seldom saw each other; there was no
courtship, not even a word for it; Seneca com- plained that everything
else was tested before purchase, but not the bride by the groom. 30
Sentimental attachment before marriage was uncommon; love poetry was
addressed to married women or to women whom the poet never thought of
marrying; and women’s escapades came after marriage, as under similar
conditions in medieval and modem France. The elder Seneca assumed
widespread adultery among Roman women , 40 and his philosopher</p>
<p>37 &lt;&gt; CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>son thought that a married woman content with two lovers was a
paragon of fidelity. 41 “Pure women,” sang the cynical Ovid, “are only
those who have not been asked; and a man who is angry at his wife’s
amours is a mere rustic.” 42 These may be literary conceits; more
reliable is the simple epitaph of Quintus Vespillo to his wife: “Seldom
do marriages last without divorce until death; but ours continued
happily for forty- one years.” 43 Juvenal tells of a woman who married
eight times in five years. 44 Having been wed for property or politics
rather than for love, some women considered their duty fulfilled if they
surrendered their dowries to their husbands and their per- sons to their
lovers. “Did we not agree,” an adulteress in Juvenal explained to her
unexpected husband, “that we should both do as we liked ?” 45 The
“emancipation” of women was as complete then as now, barring the forma
li- ties of the franchise and the letter of dead laws. Legislation kept
women subject, custom made them free.</p>
<p>In a number of cases emancipation, as in our time, meant
industrialization. Some women worked in shops or factories, especially
in the textile trades; some became lawyers and doctors ; 46 some became
politically powerful; the wives of provincial governors reviewed and
addressed troops. 47 The Vestal Virgins secured political appointments
for their friends, and the women of Pompeii announced their political
preferences on the walls. Conservatives moaned and gloated over the
apparent fulfillment of Cato’s warning that if women achieved equality
they would turn it into mastery. Juvenal was horrified to find women
actresses, athletes, gladiators, poets ; 48 Martial de- scribes them as
fighting wild beasts, even lions, in the arena ; 49 Statius tells of
women dying in such jousts. 60 Ladies rode through the streets in sedan
chairs, “exposing themselves on every side to the view”; 51 they
conversed with men in porticoes, parks, gardens, and temple courts; they
accompanied them to private or public banquets, to the amphitheater and
the theater, where “their bare shoulders,” said Ovid, “give you
something charming to contem - plate.” 52 It was a gay, colorful,
multisexual society that would have aston- ished the Periclean Greeks.
In the spring fashionable women filled the boats, shores, and villas of
Baiae and other resorts with their laughter, their proud beauty, their
amorous audacities, and political intrigue. Old men denounced them
longingly.</p>
<p>Frivolous or immoral women were then, as now, a conspicuous minority.
Quite as numerous — though not always distinct — were the ladies who
fell in love with art, religion, or literature. Sulpi cia’s verses were
thought worthy of being handed down with those of Tibullus; they were
highly erotic, but as they were addressed to her husband they were
almost virtuous. 53 Martial’s friend Theophila was a philosopher, a real
expert on the Stoic and Epicurean</p>

<p>37 1</p>
<p>systems. Some women busied themselves in philanthropy and social
service, gave temples, theaters, and porticoes to their towns, and
contributed as patronesses to collegia. An inscription at Lanuvium
speaks of a curia muli- enmt, “an assembly of women”; Rome had a
conventus matronarum;</p>
<p>Behind such heroines were the nameless wives whose marital fidelity
and maternal sacrifices sustained the whole structure of Roman life. The
old Roman virtues — pietas, gravitas, simplicitas — the mutual devotion
of parents and children, a sober sense of responsibility, an avoidance
of extravagance or display — still survived in Roman homes. The refined
and wholesome families described in Pliny’s letters did not suddenly
begin with Nerva and Trajan; they had existed quietly through the age of
the despots; they had survived the espionage of emperors, the debasement
of a helpless populace, the vulgarity of the demimonde. We catch
glimpses of such homes in the epitaphs of mate to mate and of parents to
children. “Here,” reads one, “lie the bones of Urbilia, wife of Primus.
She was dearer to me than life. She died at twenty- three, beloved of
all. Farewell, my consolation!” And another: “To my dear wife, with whom
I passed eighteen happy years. For love of her I have swo rn never to
remarry.” 56 We can picture these women in their homes — spinning wool,
scolding and educating their children, directing servants, carefully
administering their modest funds, and sharing with their husbands in the
immemorial worship of the household gods. Despite her immorality it was
Rome, not Greece, that raised the family to new heights in the ancient
world.</p>

<p>If we may judge from a few hundred statues, the Roman males of Nero’s
day were stouter and softer in figure and features than the men of the
young Republic. World rule kept many of them characteristically hard and
stem, fearful rather than lovable; but food and wine and sloth had
rounded many others into shapes that would have scandalized the Scipios.
They still shaved, or, more usually, were shaved by barbers (tonsores).
A youth’s first shave was a holyday in his life; often he piously
dedicated his original whiskers to a god. 67 Common Romans continued the
republican tradition and had their hair cut close, or even cropped, but
an increasing number of dandies had theirs curled; Mark Antony and
Domitian are so represented. Many men wore wigs, some had the semblance
of hair painted on their pates. 68 All classes, indoors and out, now
dressed in a simple tunic or blouse; the toga was donned only for formal
occa- sions, by clients at receptions and by patricians in the Senate or
at the gamfes. Caesar wore a purple toga as a sign of office; many
dignitaries imitated him; but soon the purple robe became a prerogative
of the emperors. There were no irksome trousers, no elusive buttons, no
drooping hose; but in the second century men began to wrap their legs
with fasciae, or bands. Footwear ranged from the sandal — a leather or
cork sole attached Nipponwise by a thong between the big and second toes
— to the high shoe of full leather, or of leather and cloth, usually
worn with the toga in synthesis or full dress.</p>
<p>Roman women of the early Empire, as seen in frescoes and statuary and
on coins, were much like the women of the United States at the beginning
of the twentieth century, except that they were nearly all brunette.
Their figures were moderately slender, and their robes gave their
carriage a hypnotic grace. They knew the value of sunshine, exercise,
and fresh air; some brandished dumbbells, some swam assiduously, some
dieted; others reined in their bosoms with stays. 69 Feminine hair was
usually combed back and bound in a knot behind the neck, often enclosed
in a net, and tied with a band or ribbon over the head. Later fashions
demanded a loftier coiffure, supported by wire and elaborated with a wig
of blonde hair imported from German maids. 00 A woman of fashion might
occupy several slaves for hours in manicuring her nails and dressing her
hair. 61</p>
<p>Cosmetics were as varied as today. Juvenal describes “beautification”
as one of the most important technologies of the age; physicians,
queens, and poets wrote volumes on the subject. 62 A Roman lady’s bo
udoir was an arsenal of cosmetic instruments — tweezers, scissors,
razors, files, brushes, combs, strigils, hair nets, wigs — and jars or
phials of perfumes, creams, oils, pastes, pumice stone, soaps.
Depilatories were used to remove hair, scented ointments to wave it or
fix it. Many women applied to their faces a nocturnal mask of dough and
asses’ milk in a mixture concocted by Poppaea, who found it helpful in
repairing a bad complexion; therefore asses followed her in all her
travels; sometimes she took a</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP, XVIl)</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>whole herd with her and bathed in asses’ milk. 63 Faces were whitened
or rouged with paint, brows and eyelashes were dyed black or painted
over, sometimes the veins of the temple were traced with delicate lines
of blue. 04 Juvenal complained that a rich woman “reeks of Poppaean
ointments that stick to the lips of her unfortunate husband,” who never
sees her face. Ovid found these arts disillusion - ing and advised the
ladies to conceal them from their lovers — all but the combing of their
hair, which entranced him. 60</p>
<p>Delicate lingerie was now added to the simple feminine garments of
pre- Hannibalic Rome. Scarfs fell over the shoulders, and veils made an
alluring mystery of the face. In winter soft furs caressed affluent
forms. Silk was so com- mon that men as well as women wore it. Silk and
linen were colored with costly dyes; Romans often paid a thousand
denarii for a pound of double-dyed Tyrian wool. 67 Embroideries of gold
and silver thread decorated dresses, curtains, carpets, and coverlets.
Women’s shoes were made of soft leather or cloth, sometimes elaborately
cut into an openwork pattern; they might be trimmed with gold and beset
with jewelry; 68 and high heels were often added to remedy the
shortcomings of nature.</p>
<p>Jewelry was an important part of a woman’s equipment. Rings,
earrings, neck - laces, amulets, bracelets, breast chains, brooches,
were necessities of life. Lollia Paulina once wore a dress covered from
head to foot with emeralds and pearls, and carried with her the receipts
showing that they cost 40,000,000 sesterces. 69 Pliny describes over a
hundred varieties of precious stones used in Rome. Expert imitations of
these provided a busy industry; Roman “emeralds” of glass wer e superior
to modem forgeries and were sold as genuine by jewelers as late as the
nineteenth century. 70 Men as well as women were fond of large and con-
spicuous stones. One senator had in his ring an opal as big as a
filbert. Hearing of it, Antony had him proscribed; he escaped, carrying
2,000,000 sesterces on his finger; doubtless jewelry was then, as often,
a hedge against inflation or revolution. Silver plate was now common in
all but the lower classes. Tiberius and later emperors issued edicts
against luxury, but these could not be enforced and were soon ignored.
Tiberius yielded, and confessed that the extravagance of patricians and
parvenus gave employment to the artisans of Rome and the East, and
allowed provincial tribute to flow back fro m the capital. “Without
luxury,” he said, “how could Rome, how could the provinces, live?”</p>
<p>Roman dress was not more luxurious than that of modem women, and far
less gorgeous and costly than the garb of medieval lords. Fashion did
not change in Rome as rapidly as in modern cities; a good garment might
be worn a lifetime and remain in style. But compared with the standards
of the Republic before Lucullus and Pompey had brought in the loot and
hedonism of the East, upper- class Rome was now an epicurean paradise of
fine clothing, varied food, elegant furniture, and stately homes. Shorn
of political leadership, almost of political power, the aristocracy
retired from the curia to its palaces, and abandoned itself, with no
morals but philosophy, to the pursuit of pleasure and the art of
life.</p>

<p>The luxuries of the home far outran the luxuries of dress. Floors

<p>marble and mosaic; columns of polychrome marble, alabaster, onyx;
walls painted with brilliant murals or encrusted with costly stones;
ceilings some- times coffered in gold 71 or plate glass; 72 tables with
citrus wood standing on ivory legs; divans decorated with tortoise
shell, ivory, silver, or gold; Alex- andrian brocades or Babylonian
coverings for which common millionaires paid 800,000, Nero 4,000,000,
sesterces; 73 beds of bronze fitted with mosquito netting; candelabra of
bronze, marble, or glass; statues and paintings and objects of art;
vases of Corinthian bronze or Murrhine glass — these were some of the
ornaments that crowded the mansions of Nero’s age.</p>
<p>In such a home the master lived as in a museum. Slaves had to be
bought to guard this wealth, and others to guard these. Some houses had
400 of them, engaged in attendance, supervision, or industry; the life
of the great man, even in the privacy of his rooms, was spent in the
publicity of his slaves. To eat with a servant at each elbow, to undress
with a slave at each boot, to relax with a menial at every door — this
is not paradise. To assure the misery of wealth the great man began his
day, about seven, by receiving his “clients” and parasites and offering
his cheeks to their kisses. After two hours of this he might breakfast.
Then he received and returned formal visits of his friends. Etiquette
required that one must repay the calls of every friend, help him in his
lawsuits and candidacies, attend the betrothal of his daughter, the
coming of age of his son, the reading of his poems, the signing of his
will. These and other social obligations were performed with a grace and
courtesy not exceeded in any civilization. Then the great man went to
the Senate, or labored on some governmental commission, or attended to
his personal affairs.</p>
<p>For the man of modest means life was simpler, but not less arduous.
After the social calls of the early morning he gave himself to his
business till noon. Humble folk were at their work by sunrise; as there
was little night life, the Roman took full advantage of the day. A light
luncheon came at noon, din- ner at three or four — the higher the class,
the later the hour. After luncheon and a siesta, the peasant and the
employed proletaire returned to work till nearly sunset; others sought
recreation outdoors or in the public baths. The Romans of the Empire
took their bathing more religiously than their gods. Like the Japanese,
they could bear public better than private smells, and no ancient people
but the Egyptians rivaled them in cleanliness. They carried
handkerchiefs ( sudaria ) to wipe away their sweat, 74 and brushed their
teeth with powders and paste. In the early Republic a bath every eighth
day had</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>sufficed; now one had to bathe daily or risk a Martial’s epigram;
even the rustic, says Galen, bathed every day. 76 Most homes had
bathtubs, rich houses had bathroom suites sparkling with marble, glass,
or silver fixtures and taps. 70 But the majority of free Romans relied
on the public baths.</p>
<p>Ordinarily these were privately owned. In 33 b.c. there were 170
in</p>
<p>Rome; in the fourth century a. d. there were 856, besides 1352 public
swim- ming pools. 77 More popular than such establishments were the
great baths built by the state, managed by concessionaires and staffed
by hundreds of slaves. These thermae — “hot [waters]”— erected by
Agrippa, Nero, Titus, Trajan, Caracalla, Alexander Severus, Diocletian,
and Constantine, were monuments of state-socialistic splendor. The Baths
of Nero had 1600 marble seats and accommodated 1600 bathers at one time;
the Baths of Caracalla and those of Diocletian accommodated 3000 each.
Admission was open to any citizen for a quadrans ( 1 1 / 2 cents) ; 78
the government met the balance of the cost, and apparently oil and
service were included in the fee. The baths were open from daybreak to
one p.m. for women, from two to eight p.m. for men; but mixed bathing
was allowed by most of the emperors. Normally the visitor went first to
a dressing room to change his clothes; then to the palaestra to box,
wrestle, run, jump, hurl the disk or the spear, or play ball. One ball
game was like our “medicine ball”; in another two opposed groups
scrambled for a ball, and carried it forward against each other with all
the enterprise of a modem university. 70 Sometimes professional
ballplayers would come to the baths and give exhibitions. 80 Oldsters
who preferred to take their exercise by proxy went to massage rooms and
had a slave rub away their fat.</p>
<p>Passing to the baths proper, the citizen entered the tepidarium — in
this case a warm-air room; thence he went on to the calidarium, or
hot-air room; if he wished to perspire still more freely, he moved into
the laconicum, and gasped in superheated steam. Then he took a warm bath
and washed himself with a novelty learned from the Gauls — soap, made
from tallow and the ashes of the beech or the elm. 81 These warm rooms
were the most popular and gave the baths their Greek name; probably they
were Rome’s attempt to forestall or mitigate rheumatism and arthritis.
82 The bather progressed to the frigidarium and took a cold bath; he
might also dip into the piscina, or swim- ming pool. Then he had himself
rubbed with some oil or ointment, usually made from the olive; this was
not washed off, but merely scraped off with a strigil and dried with a
towel, so that some oil might be returned to the skin in place of that
which the warm baths had removed.</p>
<p>The bather.seldomJeft the thermae at this point. For these were
clubhouses as well as baths; they provided rooms for games like dice and
chess , 88 galleries</p>
<p>37 6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVn</p>
<p>of painring and statuary, exedrae where friends might sit and
converse, li- braries and reading rooms, and halls where a musician or a
poet might give a recital or a philosopher might explain the world. In
these afternoon hours after the bath Roman society found its chief
meeting point; both sexes mingled freely in gay but polite association,
flirtation, or discussion; there, and at the games and in the paries,
the Romans could indulge their passion for talk, their fondness for
gossip, and learn all the news and scandal of the If they wished they
could have dinner in the restaurant at the baths, but most of them dined
at home. Perhaps because of the lassitude caused by exer- cise and warm
bathing, the custom was to recline at meals. Once the women had sat
apart while the men reclined; now the women reclined beside the men. The
triclinium, or dining room, was so named because it usually con- tained
three couches, arranged in square-magnet form around a serving table.
Each couch normally accommodated three persons. The diner rested his
head on his left arm, and his arm on a cushion, while the body extended
diagonally away from the serving table.</p>
<p>The poorer classes continued to live chiefly on grains, dairy
products, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Pliny lists a wide assortment of
vegetables in the Roman dietary, from garlic to rape. The well to do ate
meat, with the usual superabundance of reckless carnivores. Pork was the
favorite flesh food; Pliny praises the pig for furnishing fifty
different dainties. 8 ’ 1 Pork sausages ( botuli ) were hawked through
the streets in portable ovens, as on our high- ways today.</p>
<p>When one dined at a banquet he expected rarer foods. The banquet
began at four and lasted till late in the night or till the next day.
The tables were strewn with flowers and parsley, the air was scented
with exotic perfumes, the couches were soft with cushions, the servants
were stiff with livery. Be- tween the appetizer (gustatio) and the
dessert ( secunda mensa, “second table”) came the luxury dishes on which
the host and his chef prided them - selves. Rare fish, rare birds, rare
fruit, appealed to the curiosity as well as the palate. Mullets were
bought at a thousand sesterces a pound; Asinius Celer paid 8000 for one;
Juvenal growled that a fisherman cost less than a fish. As an added
delight for the guests, the mullet might be brought in alive and boiled
before their eyes, that they might enjoy the varied colors it took in
the agony of death. 86 Vedius Pollio raised these sesquipedalian fish in
a large tank and fed them with unsatisfactory slaves. 80 Eels and snails
were con- sidered dainties, but the law forbade the eating of dormice.
87 The wings of ostriches, the tongues of flamingoes, the flesh of
songbirds, the livers of geese, were favorite dishes. Apicius, a famous
epicure under Tiberius, invented</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>he pdte de fois gras by fattening the livers of sows with a diet of
figs. 88 * Custom allowed the diner to empty his stomach with an emetic
after a heavy banquet. Some gluttons performed this operation during the
meal and then returned to appease their hunger; vomunt ut edant, edunt
ut vomcmt , said Seneca — “they vomit to eat, and eat to vomit.” 00 Such
behavior was excep - tional, and no worse than the braggart drunkenness
of American conven- tioneers. Pleasanter was the custom of presenting
gifts to the guests, or let- ting flowers or perfumes fall upon them
from the ceiling, or entertaining them with music, dancing, poetry, or
drama. Conversation, loosened with wine and stimulated by the presence
of the other sex, would conclude the evening.</p>
<p>We must not think of such banquets as the customary end of a Roman
day, or as more frequent in a Roman’s life than the dinners
-cwwz-oratory so popu- lar today. History, like the press, misrepresents
life because it loves the ex- ceptional and shuns the newsless career of
an honest man or the quiet routine of a normal day. Most Romans were
like our neighbors and ourselves: they rose reluctantly, ate too much,
worked too much, played too little, loved much, seldom hated, quarreled
a bit, talked a great deal, dreamed waking dreams, and slept.</p>

<li>A ROMAN HOLIDAY</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Stage</li>
</ol>
<p>Having many gods to worship, and many provinces to milk, Rome had
many holidays, once solemn with religious pageantry, now gay with
secular delight. In summer many of the poor fled from the humid heat to
suburban or riverside taverns or groves, drinking, dining, dancing, and
loving in the open air. Those who could afford it might go to the
bathing resorts that lined the western coast, or sport with the rich on
Baiae’s bay. In win ter it was the ambition of every caste-conscious
Roman to go south, if possible to Rhegium or Tarentum, and return with a
coat of tan as a certificate of class. But those who stayed in Rome
found entertainment plentiful and cheap. Recitations, lectures,
concerts, mimes, plays, athletic contests, prize fights, horse races,
chariot races, mortal combats of men with men or beasts, not-quite-sham
naval battles on artificial lakes — never was a city more bountifully
amused.</p>
<p>In the early Empire there were in the Roman year seventy-six festival
days on which ludi were performed. Of these, fifty-five were ludi
scenici,</p>
<p>• Apicius squandered a huge fortune in extravagant living; then,
being reduced to 10,000,000 sesterces (,500,000), he committed suicide.

<p>378 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVH</p>
<p>devoted to plays or mimes; twenty-two were games in the circus, the
stadium, or the amphitheater. The number of ludi increased until by a.d.
354 they were presented on 175 days in the year. 81 This meant no growth
in the Roman drama; on the contrary, the drama decayed while the stage
prospered. Original dramas were now written to be read rather than
played; the theater contented itself with old Roman and Greek tragedies,
old Roman comedies, and mimes. Stars dominated the stage and made huge
fortunes. Aesopus the tragedian, after a life of assiduous extravagance,
left 20,000,- 000 sesterces. Roscius the comic actor made 500,000
sesterces a year and became so rich that for several seasons he acted
without pay — a scorn of money that made this ex-slave the lion of
aristocratic gatherings. The games of the circus and the amphitheater
absorbed the interest and coarsened the taste of the public, and the
Roman drama died in the arena, another martyr to Roman holidays.</p>
<p>Through emphasis on acting and scenery rather than plot or thought,
the drama gradually yielded the stage to mimes and pantomimes. The mime
contained little dialogue, chose its themes from lowly life, and relied
on character sketches presented with skillful mimicry. Freedom of
speech, hav- ing disappeared from the assemblies and the Forum, survived
for a moment in these brief farces, when a mime would risk his head to
earn applause by a double-entendre aimed at an emperor or his favorites.
Caligula had an actor burned alive in the amphitheater for such an
allusion. 92 On the day when the parsimonious Vespasian was buried a
mime imitated the obsequies. During the procession the corpse sat up and
asked how much this funeral was costing the state. “Ten million
sesterces,” was the answer. “Give me 100,000,” said the imperial
cadaver, “and throw me into the Tiber.” 0 3 The mime alone admitted
women as actors; and as these were thereby auto- matically classed as
prostitutes, they had nothing to lose by obscenity. On special occasions
like the Floralia the audience called upon these performers to remove
every garment. 04 Both sexes attended these performances, as in our
time. Cicero found brides there, and they found him.</p>
<p>By suppressing speech altogether, and raising the theme to subjects
from classic literature, the pantomime (“all mimicry”) was evolved out
of th e mime. There was a profit in foregoing language; the polyglot
population of Rome, of which a considerable part could understand only
the simplest Latin, followed the action better when unburdened with
words. In 2 1 b.c. two actors, Pylades of Cilicia and Bathyllus of
Alexandria, came to Rome and introduced the pantomime — already popular
in the Hellenistic East — by performing one-act plays composed only of
music, action, gesture, and dance. Tired of dramas in ancient and
pompous verse, Rome welcomed the new art, thrilled to the grace and
skill of the actors, enjoyed the gorgeousness</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>chap, xvn)</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>of their costumes, the splendor or humor of their masks, the trained
and dieted perfection of their figures, the Oriental expressiveness of
their hands, their quick and versatile impersonation of diverse
characters, their sensuous enactment of erotic scenes. Audiences divided
into frantic cliques and claques in support of rival favorites; women of
high station fell in love with the actors, and pursued them with gifts
and embraces, until one literally lost his head over Domitian’s wife.
The pantomime gradually drove all rivals but the mime from the Roman
stage. The drama succumbed to the ballet.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Roman Music</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a triumph was made possible by the high development of music and
the dance. Under the Republic dancing had been looked upon as
disgraceful; the younger Scipio had compelled the closing of schools
that taught music and dancing, 95 and Cicero had remarked that “only a
lunatic would dance when sober.” 95 But the pantomimes made dancing a
fashion, then a passion; nearly every private home, says Seneca, had a
dancing platform, echoing to the feet of men and women; rich households
now had a dancing master, as well as a chef and a philosopher, as part
of their equipment. As practiced in Rome the dance involved the
rhythmical movement of the hands and the upper body even more than of
legs and feet. Women cultivated the art not only for its own
attractiveness, but because it gave them flexibility and grace.</p>
<p>The Romans loved music only less than power, money, women, and blood.
Like nearly everything else in Rome’s cultural life, her music came from
Greece and had to fight its way against a conservatism that identified
art with degeneration. In 1 1 5 b.c. the censors had forbidden the
playing of any instrument except the short Italian flute. A century
later the elder Seneca still considered music unmanly; but meanwhile
Varro had devoted a book to De Musica, and this treatise, together with
its Greek sources, became the support of many Roman works on musical
theory. 97 Finally the rich and sensuous Greek modes and instruments won
the day over Roman awkward- ness and simplicity, and music became a
regular element in the education of women, and frequently of men. By
a.d. 50 it had captured all classes and sexes; men as well as women
spent whole days in hearing, composing, or singing airs; at last even
emperors climbed and descended scales, and the philosophic Hadrian, as
well as the effeminate Nero, was proud of his skill on the lyre. Lyric
poetry was intended to be sung with music, and music was seldom composed
except for poetry; ancient music was subordinated to the verse, whereas
with us the music tends to overwhelm the words. Choral music was popular
and was frequently heard at weddings, games,</p>
<p>}80 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>religious ceremonies, and funerals. Horace was deeply moved by the
sight and sound of youths and maidens singing his carmen saeculare. In
such choruses all the voices sang the same note, though in different
octaves; part singing was apparently unknown.</p>
<p>The basic instruments were the flute and the lyre. Our wind and
string orchestras are still variations of these forms: the most heroic
symphony is a judicious combination of puffing, plucking, scraping, and
beating. The flute accompanied drama and was supposed to arouse emotion;
the lyre attended song and was expected to elevate the soul. The flute
was long, had many openings, and a greater range of expression than the
modern instru- ment* The lyre and the cithara were like our harp, but
took a greater variety of shapes. Among the Greeks they had been of
modest size, but the Romans magnified them until Ammianus d escribed
citharas “as large as carriages”; 98 in general the Roman instruments,
like ours, improved upon earlier ones chiefly in sonorousness and size.
The strings of the lyre were made of gut or sinew and numbered up to
eighteen; they were plucked with a plectrum or with the fingers — which
alone could execute the quicker runs. From Alexandria, early in the
first century, came the hydraulic organ, with several registers, stops,
and orders of pipes. Nero fell in love with it, and the calm Quintilian
was impressed by its versatility and power.</p>
<p>Formal concerts were given, and musical contests played a part in
some public games. Even modest dinners required a bit of music; Martial
promises his guest at least a flute player; 99 as for Trimalchio’s feas
t, the tables are wiped in rhythm with song. Caligula had an orchestra
and a chorus on his pleasure boat. At the pantomimes symphoniae were
performed — i.e., a chorus sang and danced to the accompaniment of an
orchestra. Sometimes the actor would sing the solo parts, sometimes a
professional singer ( cantor ) sang the words while the actor gestured
or danced. It was not unheard of for a panto- mime to be accompanied by
3000 singers and 3000 dancers. 100 The orchestra was led by flutes,
aided by lyres, cymbals, pipes, trumpets, “syringes,” and scabella —
boards fastened to the players’ feet and capable of producing a
pandemonium even more frightful than that of a modern orchestra at the
height of its powers. Seneca mentions harmony in the playing of indi-
viduals, 101 but there is no sign that ancient orchestras used harmony
con- trapuntally. The accompaniment was usually on a higher note than
the song, but it did not, so far as we know, pursue a distinct
sequence.</p>
<p>Virtuosi were plentiful and minor performers abounded. Talent con-
verged from all provinces upon the center of the world’s gold, while the
institution of slavery permitted the training of choruses and orchestras
on a large but inexpensive scale. Many rich establishments had their own
musi- cians, and sent the most promising to famous teachers for advanced
instruc-</p>

<p>ion. Some became citharoedi and gave concerts in which they sang and
played the lyre; some specialized in singing, usually composing their
own songs; some gave concerts on the organ or the flute like Cannus, who
boasted, in the style of Beethoven, that his music could alleviate
sorrow, increase joy, elevate piety, and fan the flame of love. 102
These professionals went on extended concert tours throughout the
Empire, earning plaudits, fees, public monuments, and infatuations;
some, says Juvenal, sold their love for an added honorarium. 108 Women
fought for the plectra with which famous players had touched the
strings, and offered sacrifice at the altars for the victory of their
musical favorites in the Neronian and Capitoline games. We can faintly
picture the imposing scene when musicians, and poets from all the realm
competed before great throngs, and the breathless winners re- ceived the
crown of oak leaves from the emperor’s hands.</p>
<p>We do not know enough of Roman music to describe its quality. Ap-
parently it was louder, fuller, wilder than the Greek; a weird Oriental
quality had entered it from Egypt, Asia Minor, and Syria. Old men
mourned that recent composers were abandoning the restraint and dignity
of the classic style, and were disordering the soul and nerves of youth
with extrava- gant airs and noisy instruments. Certainly no people ever
loved music more. The songs of the stage were caught up by a lively and
volatile populace and rang through the streets and windows of Rome; the
complex airs of the pantomimes were so fondly remembered that devotees
could tell from the first notes of a strain to what play and scene it
belonged. Rome made no real contribution to music, except perhaps
through the better organiza- tion of performers into larger groups. But
it honored music with exuberant usage and resilient response; it
gathered the musical heritage of the ancient world into its temples,
theaters, and homes; and when it passed it left to the Church the
instruments and elements of the music that moves and deepens us
today.</p>

<li>The Games</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that war seemed banished, the great games were the most exciting
event of the Roman year. They took place chiefly in celebration of
religious festivals — of the Great Mother, of Ceres, of Flora, of
Apollo, of Augustus; they might be the “Plebeian Games” to appease the
plebs, or “Roman Games” in honor of the city and its goddess Roma; they
might be offered in connection with triumphs, candidacies, elections, or
imperial birthdays; they might, like the ludi saeculares, commemorate
some cycle in Roman history. Like the games of Achilles in honor of
Patroclus, those of Italy had originally been offered as a sacrifice to
dead men. At the funeral of</p>
<p>382 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVD</p>
<p>Brutus Pera in 264 b.c. his sons gave a “spectacle” of three duels;
at the funeral of Marcus Lepidus in 2 1 6 b.c. twenty-two combats were
fought; and in 174 b.c. Titus Flaminius celebrated his father’s death
with gladiatorial games in which seventy-four men fought.</p>
<p>The simplest public games were athletic contests, usually held in a
stadium. The performers, mostly professionals and aliens, ran foot
races, threw the discus, wrestled, and boxed. The Roman public,
accustomed to sanguinary gladiatorial exhibitions, only mildly favored
athletics, but relished the prize fights in which massive Greeks fought
almost to the death with gloves re- inforced at the knuckles with an
iron band three quarters of an inch thick. The gentle Virgil describes a
milder pugilistic feast in almost modem terms:</p>
<p>Then the son of Anchises brought out hide gloves of equal weight,</p>
<p>and bound the hands of the antagonists…. Each took his stand,</p>
<p>poised on tiptoe and raising one arm…. Drawing their heads back</p>
<p>from the blows they spar, hand against hand. They aim many hard</p>
<p>blows, wildly pummeling each other’s sides and chests, ears and brows
and cheeks, making the air resound with their strokes…. Entellus</p>
<p>puts forth his right; Dares slips aside in a nimble dodge….
Entellus</p>
<p>furiously drives Dares headlong over the arena, redoubling his blows,
now with the right hand, now with the left…. Then Aeneas put</p>
<p>an end to the fray, Dares’ mates led him to the ships with his
knees</p>
<p>shaking, his head swaying from side to side, his mouth spitting teeth
and blood. 104</p>
<p>Still more exciting were the races at the Circus Maximus. On two suc-
cessive days forty-four races were run, some of horses and jockeys, some
of light two-wheeled chariots drawn by two, three, or four horses
abreast. The cost was met by rival stables owned by rich men; the
jockeys, drivers, and chariots of each stable were costumed or painted
in distinctive colors- white, green, red, or blue; and all Rome, as the
time for these contests ap- proached, divided into factions named from
these colors, and particularly the red and the green. At home, in
school, at lectures, in the forums, half the talk was about favorite
jockeys and charioteers; their pictures were everywhere, their victories
were announced in the Acta Diuma ; some of them made great fortunes,
some had statues raised to them in public squares. On the appointed day
180,000 men and women moved in festive colors to the enormous
hippodrome. Enthusiasm rose to a mania. Excited partisans smelled the
dung of the animals to assure themselves that the horses of then-
favorite drivers had been properly fed. 105 The spectators passed by the
shops and brothels that lined the outer walls; they filed through
hundreds of en- trances and sorted themselves with the sweat of anxiety
into the great horse- shoe of seats. Vendors sold them cushions, for the
seats were mostly of hard</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>383</p>
<p>wood, and the program would last all day. Senators and other
dignitaries had special seats of marble, ornamented with bronze. Behind
the imperial box was a suite of luxurious rooms, where the emperor and
his family might eat, drink, rest, bathe, and sleep. Gambling was
feverish, and fortunes passed from hand to hand as the day advanced.
From openings under the stands emerged the horses, the jockeys and
drivers, and the chariots; and each faction shook the stands with
applause as its favorite color appeared. The charioteers, mostly slaves,
wore bright tunics and shining helmets; in one hand was a whip, and in
their belts a knife to cut, in accident, the traces tied to their
waists. Along the middle of the elliptical arena ran the spina (“thorn,”
“spine”), an island a thousand feet long, adorned with statues and
obelisks; at one end were the metae (“measures”), circular pillars that
served as goals. The usual length of a chariot race was seven circuits,
about five miles. The test of skill lay in making the turns at the goals
as swiftly and sharply as safety would allow; collisions were frequent
there, and men, chariots, and animals mingled in fascinating tragedy. As
the horses or chariots clattered to the final post the hypnotized
audience rose like a swell- ing sea, gesticulated, waved handkerchiefs,
shouted and prayed, groaned and cursed, or exulted in almost
supernatural ecstasy. The applause that greeted the winner could be
heard far beyond the limits of the city.</p>
<p>The most stupendous of all the spectacles offered at Roman
celebrations was the sham naval battle. The first large naumachia was
given by Caesar in a basin excavated for the purpose on the outskirts of
the city. Augustus marked the dedication of his temple to Mars the
Avenger by presenting 3000 fighters in a replica of the battle of
Salamis on an artificial lake 1800 by 1200 feet. Claudius, as already
noted, celebrated the completion of the Fucine tunnel with a conflict of
triremes and quadriremes involving 19,000 men. They fought with a
disappointing courtesy, and soldiers had to be sent among them to ensure
a proper shedding of blood. 100 At the dedication of the Colosseum Titus
had its arena flooded, and reproduced that battle of the Corinthians and
Corcyreans which had brought on the Peloponnesian War. The combatants in
these engagements were war captives or con- demned criminals. They
butchered one another until one side or the other was killed off; the
victors, if they had cut bravely, might be granted freedom.</p>
<p>The games reached their climax in the contests of animals and
gladiators in the amphitheater — after Vespasian, in the Colosseum. The
arena was an immense wooden floor strewn with sand; parts of this floor
could be lowered and then quickly raised with a change of scene; and at
brief notice the whole floor could be covered with water. Large chambers
beneath it held the animals, machines, and men scheduled for the program
of the day. Just above</p>
<p>384 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>he arena’s guard wall was a podium or marble terrace on whose ornate
seats sat senators, priests, and high officials; above this was the
suggestion, a high loge where the emperor and empress sat on thrones of
ivory and gold, sur- rounded by their family and retinue. Behind this
aristocratic circle sat the equestrian order, in twenty tiers of seats.
A lofty intervening wall, decorated with statuary, separated the upper
orders from the lower classes in the stands above. Any free person, male
or female, could come, and apparently no admission was charged. The
crowd took advantage of the emperor’s presence, here and at the circus,
to shout its wishes to him — for the pardon of a prisoner or a fallen
fighter, the emancipation of a courageous slave, the appearance of
favorite gladiators, or some minor reform. From the topmost wall awnings
could be unrolled to the arena railing to shade such parts of the
assemblage as might suffer from the sun. Here and there fountains threw
up jets of scented water to cool the air. When noon came most of the
spectators hurried below to eat lunch; concessionaires were on hand to
sell them food and sweets and drinks. On occasion the entire multitude
might be fed by the order and bounty of the emperor, or dainties and
presents might be scattered among the scrambling crowd. If, as sometimes
occurred, contests were presented at night, a circle of lights could be
lowered over the arena and the spectators. Bands of musicians performed
in the interludes and accompanied the crises of the combats with
exciting crescendo strains.</p>
<p>The simplest event in the amphitheater was an exhibition of exotic
animals. Gathered from all the known world, elephants, lions, tigers,
crocodiles, hippopotami, lynxes, apes, panthers, bears, boars, wolves,
giraffes, ostriches, stags, leopards, antelopes, and rare birds were
kept in the zoological gardens of emperors and rich men, and were
trained to skillful exploits or merry pranks; apes were taught to ride
dogs, drive chariots, or act in plays; bulls let boys dance on their
backs; sea lions were conditioned to bark in answer to their individual
names; elephants danced to cymbals struck by other elephants, or they
walked a rope, or sat down to table, or wrote Greek or Latin letters.
Animals might be merely paraded in bright or humorous costumes; usually,
however, they were made to fight one another, or with men, or they were
hunted to death with arrows and javelins. In one day, under Nero, 400
tigers fought with bulls and elephants; on another day, under Caligula,
400 bears were slain; at the dedication of the Colosseum 5000 animals
died. 107 If the animals wished to compromise they were stung to combat
by lashes, darts, and hot irons. Claudius made a division of the
Praetorian Guard fight panthers; Nero made them fight 400 bears and 300
lions. 108</p>
<p>Combats of a bull with a man, long popular in Crete and Thessaly,
were</p>

<p>385</p>
<p>introduced into Rome by Caesar and were a frequent spectacle in the
amphitheater. 109 Condemned criminals, sometimes dressed in skins to re-
semble animals, were thrown to beasts made ravenous for the occasion;
death in such cases came with all possible agony, and wounds were so
deep that physicians used such men to study internal anatomy. All the
world knows the story of Androcles, the runaway slave; captured, he was
flung into the arena with a lion; but this lion, we are told, remembered
that Androcles had once drawn a thorn from its paw, and refused to
injure him. Androcles was pardoned, and made a living by exhibiting his
civilized lion in taverns. 110 The condemned man was sometimes required
to play in no make- believe way some famous tragic role: he might
represent Medea’s rival, and be garbed in a handsome robe that would
suddenly burst into flame and consume him; he might be burned to death
on a pyre as Heracles; he might (if we may believe Tertullian) be
publicly castrated as Atys; he might play Mucius Scaevola and hold his
hand over burning coals until it was shriveled up; he might be Icarus
and fall from the sky into no merciful ocean but a crowd of wild beasts;
he might be Pasiphae, and bear the embraces of a bull. One victim was
dressed as Orpheus; he was sent with his lyre into an arena set as a
pleasant grove of trees and brooks; suddenly hungry animals emerged from
recesses and tore him to pieces. 111 Laureolus, a robber, was crucified
in the arena for the amusement of the populace; but as he took too long
in dying, a bear was brought in and was persuaded to eat him, piece by
piece, as he hung upon the cross. Martial describes the spectacle with
fascination and approval. 112</p>
<p>The supreme events were the combats of armed men, in duels or en
masse. The contestants were war captives, condemned criminals, or
disobedient slaves. The right of victors to slaughter their prisoners
was generally ac- cepted throughout antiquity, and the Romans thought
themselves generous in giving captives a chance for their lives in the
arena. Men convicted of capital crimes were brought to Rome from all
parts of the Empire, were sent to gladiatorial schools, and soon
appeared in the games. If they fought with exceptional bravery they
might win immediate freedom; if they merely survived they had to fight
again and again as holidays recurred; if they lasted three years they
were released into slavery; if then they satisfied their masters for two
years they were freed. Crimes entailing condemnation to a gladiatorial
career were limited to murder, robbery, arson, sacrilege, and mutiny,
but sedulous governors responsive to imperial needs might override these
restrictions if the arena ran short of men. 113 Even knights and
senators might be sentenced to fight as gladiators, and sometimes a
passion for ap- plause led members of the equestrian order to offer
themselves as volunteers.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>(chap, xvn</p>
<p>Not a few men, under the lure of adventure and danger, enlisted in
the gladiatorial schools.</p>
<p>Such schools had existed in Rome as early as 105 b.c. Under the
Empire there were four of them there, several more in Italy, and one in
Alexandria. Rich men, in Caesar’s day, had their own schools for
preparing slaves to be gladiators. They used the graduates as bodyguards
in peace and as aides in war, hired them out to fight at private
banquets, and lent them to the games. On entering a professional
gladiatorial school many a novice took an oath “to suffer himself to be
whipped with rods, burned with fi re, and killed with steel.” 114
Training and discipline were rigorous; diet was supervised by
physicians, who prescribed barley to develop muscle; violation of rules
was punished by scourging, branding, and confinement in chains. Not all
of these candidates for death were discontented with their lot. Some
were elated with victories and thought of their prowess rather than
their peril; some complained that they were not allowed to fight often
enough; 115 such men hated Tiberius for giving so few games. They had
the stimulus and consolation of fame; their names were daubed by
admirers upon public walls; women fell in love with them, poets sang of
them, painters portrayed them, sculptors carved for posterity their iron
biceps and terrifying frowns. Many, however, were despondent at their
imprisonment, their brutalizing routine, and their brief expectation of
life. Several committed suicide; one by stuffing his throat with a
sponge used to clean privies, another by insert- ing his head between
the spokes of a moving wheel, several by hara-kiri in the arena. 110</p>
<p>On the eve of their combat they were given a rich banquet. The
rougher ones ate and drank heartily; others took sad leave of their
wives and chil- dren; those who were Christians joined i n a last agape,
or “supper of love.” The next morning they entered the arena in festal
dress and paraded from one end of it to the other. They were usually
armed with swords, or spears, or knives, and armored with bronze
helmets, shields, shoulderplates, breast- plates, and greaves. They were
classified according to their weapons: retictrii, who entangled their
opponents with nets and dispatched them with daggers; secutores, skilled
in pursuit with shield and sword; laqueatores, slingshooters; dimachae,
with a short sword in each hand; essedarii, who fought in chariots;
bestiarii, who contended with beasts. Besides these enter- prises the
gladiators engaged in duels, in pairs or in groups. If a dueler in a
single combat was seriously wounded, the provider of the games asked the
spectators for their will; they held thumbs up — or waved handkerchiefs
— as signs of mercy, or turned thumbs down ( pollice verso) to signify
that the victor was to kill the defeated forthwith. 117 Any combatant
who betrayed a reluctance to die aroused the resentment of the people
and was prodded to</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>bravery by hot irons. 118 Richer slaughter was furnished by mass
battles in which thousands of men fought with desperate ferocity. In the
eight spectacles given by Augustus 10,000 men took part in such
wholesale con- flicts. Attendants in the garb of Charon probed the
fallen with sharp rods to see if they were feigning death, and killed
such actors with mallet blows on the head. Other attendants, dressed
like Mercury, dragged the bodies away with hooks, while Moorish slaves
gathered up the bloodied ground in shovels and spread fresh sand for the
next death.</p>
<p>Most Romans defended the gladiatorial games on the ground that the
victims had been condemned to death for serious crimes, that the
sufferings they endured acted as a deterrent to others, that the courage
with which the doomed men were trained to face wounds and death inspired
the people to Spartan virtues, and that the frequent sight of blood and
battle accustomed Romans to the demands and sacrifices of war. Juvenal,
who denounced everything else, left the games unscathed; the younger
Pliny, a highly civil- ized man, praised Trajan for providing spectacles
that impel men “to noble wounds and the scorn of death”; 119 and Tacitus
reflected that the blood spilled in the arena was in any case vilis
sanguis — the “cheap gore” of com - mon men. 120 Cicero was revolted by
the slaughter; “what entertainment,”</p>
<p>I come home more greedy, more cruel and inhuman, because I have been
among human beings. By chance I attended a midday exhibi-</p>
<p>ion, expecting some fun, wit, and relaxation… whereb y men’s</p>
<p>eyes may have respite from the slaughter of their fellow men. But</p>
<p>it was quite the contrary…. These noon fighters are sent out with</p>
<p>no armor of any kind; they are exposed to blows at all points,
and</p>
<p>no one ever strikes in vain…. In the morning they throw men to</p>
<p>he lions; at noon they throw them to the spectators. The crowd</p>
<p>demands that the victor who has slain his opponent shall face the</p>
<p>man who will slay him in turn; and the last conqueror is reserved for
another butchering…. This sort of thing goes on while the stands</p>
<p>are nearly empty…. Man, a sacred thing to man, is killed for</p>
<p>sport and merriment. 122</p>

<li>THE NEW FAITHS</li>
</ol>
<p>Religion accepted the games as proper forms of religious celebration
and inaugurated them with solemn processions. The Vestal Virgins and the
priests occupied seats of honor in the theaters,.at the circus, and
before the arena. The emperor who presided was the high priest of the
state religion.</p>
<p>Augustus and his successors had done everything they could to
revitalize the old faith, except to live moral lives; even the declared
atheists among them, like Caligula and Nero, had carried out all the
ritual traditionally due the official gods. The Luperci priests still
danced through the streets on their festival day; the Arval Brethren
still mumbled prayers to Mars in old Latin that no one could understand.
Divination and augury were assidu- ously practiced and widely trusted;
all but a few philosophers believed in astrology, and the emperors who
banished astrologers consulted them. Magic and sorcery, witchcraft and
superstition, charms and incantations, “portents” and the interpretation
of dreams were deeply woven into the tissue of Roman life. Augustus
studied his dreams with the diligence of a modern psychologist; Seneca
saw women sitting on the steps of the Capitol waiting the pleasure of
Jupiter because their dreams had told them they were desired of the god.
123 Every consul celebrated his inauguration by sacrificing steers;
Juvenal, who could laugh at everything else, piously slit the throats of
two lambs and a young ox in gratitude for the safe voyage of a friend.
Temples were rich with gold and silver offerings; candles burned before
the altars; the lips, hands, and feet of divine images were worn by the
kisses of the devout. The old religion seemed still vigorous; it created
new gods like Annona (gatherer of the world’s com for Rome), put new
life into the worship of Fortuna and Roma, and gave powerful support to
law, order, and tyranny. If Augustus had returned a year after his death
he might well have claimed that his religious revival had proved a happy
success.</p>
<p>Despite these appearances the ancient faith was diseased at the
bottom and at the top. The deification of the emperors revealed not how
much the upper classes thought of their rulers, but how little they
thought of their gods. Among educated men philosophy was whittling away
belief even while patronizing it. Lucretius had not been without effect;
men did not mention him, but merely because it was easier to practice
epicureanism than to study Epicurus or his passionate expositor. The
rich youths who went to Athens, Alexandria, and Rhodes for higher
education found no sustenance there for the Roman creed. Greek poets
made fun of the Roman pantheon, and Roman poets leaped to imitate them.
The poems of Ovid</p>
<p>EPICUREAN ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>assumed that the gods were fables; the epigrams of Martial assumed
that they were jokes; and no one seems to have complained. Many of the
mimes ridiculed the gods; one whipped Diana off the stage, another
showed Jove making his will in expectation of death. 124 Juvenal, like
Plato five centuries before him and ourselves eighteen centuries after
him, noted that the fear of a watchful deity had lost its power to
discourage perjury. 123 Even on the tombstones of the poor we note
increasing skepticism, and some candid sensuality. Non fui, fui, non
sum, non euro, reads one — “I was not, I was, I am not, I care not”; and
another, Non fueram, non sum, nescio— ’l had not been, I am not, I know
not”; and another, “What I have eaten and drunk is my own; I have had my
life.” 120 “I believe in nothing beyond the grave,” says one tombstone;
“There is no Hades, no Charon, no Cerberus,” asserts another. “Now,” a
harassed soul wrote, “I need never fear hunger, need never pay rent, and
am at least free from gout”; and a somber Lucretian writes of the buried
flesh: “The e lements out of which he was formed take possession of
their own again. Life is only lent to man; he cannot keep it forever. By
his death he pays his debt to Nature.” 127</p>
<p>But doubt, however honest, cannot long take the place of belief. Amid
all its pleasures this society had not found happiness. Its refinements
wearied it, its debaucheries exhausted it; rich and poor were still
subject to pain and grief and death. Philosophy — least of all so coldly
superior a doctrine as Stoicism — could never give the common man a
faith to grace his poverty, encourage his decency, solace his sorrows,
and inspire his hopes. The old religion had fulfilled the first of these
functions; it had failed in the rest. Men wanted revelation, and it gave
them ritual; they wanted immortality, and it gave them games. Men who
had come, enslaved or free, from other states felt excluded from this
nationalistic worship; therefore they brought their own gods with them,
built their own temples, practiced their own rites; in the very heart of
the West they planted the religions of the East. Between the creeds of
the conquerors and the faith of the defeated a war took form in which
the weapons of the legions were useless; the needs of the heart would
determine the victory.</p>
<p>The new deities came with war captives, returning soldiers, and mer-
chants. Traders from Asia and Egypt set up temples in Puteoli, Ostia,
and Rome for the cult of their traditional gods. The Roman government
treated these alien faiths for the most part with toleration; since it
would not admit foreigners to its own worship it preferred that they
should practice their imported rites rather than have no religion at
all. In return it required that each new faith should exercise a similar
tolerance towards other creeds, and should include in its ritual some
obeisance to the emperor’s “genius” and the goddess Roma, as an
expression of loyalty to the state. Encouraged</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>(chap, xvn</p>
<p>by this lenience, the Oriental faiths already domiciled in Rome
became major religions of the populace. Hoping to civilize the cult,
Claudius re- moved the restrictions that had harassed the worship of the
Great Mother; he allowed Romans to become her ministrants, and
established her feast around the vernal equinox, from March 15 to 27.
Her chief rival in this first Christian century was Isis, the Egyptian
goddess of motherhood, fer- tility, and trade. Again and again the
government had forbidden the cult in Rome, but it always returned; the
piety of the devotees overcame the power of the state, and Caligula
marked the surrender by building with public funds an immense shrine to
her in the Field of Mars. Otho and Domi- tian took part in the Isiac
festivals; Commodus, with shaven head, walked humbly behind the priests,
holding reverently in his arms a statue of Anubis, the Egyptian monkey
god.</p>
<p>The divine invasion swelled from year to year. From southern Italy
came the worship of Pythagoras — vegetarianism and reincarnation. From
Hierap- olis came Atargatis, known to the Romans as dea Syria, “the
Syrian goddess,” Aziz the “Zeus of Doliche,” and other strange gods;
their worship was spread by Syrian merchants and slaves; and at last a
young priest of a Syrian Baal ascended the throne as Elagabalus —
worshiper of the god of the sun. From hostile Parthia came the cult of
another sun-god, Mithras; its devotees were enlisted as soldiers in the
great cosmic war of Light against Darkness, of Good against Evil; it was
a virile faith that won men rather than women, and pleased the Roman
legions stationed on distant frontiers where they could hardly hear the
voices of their native gods. From Judea came Yahweh, an uncompromising
monotheist who commanded the most difficult life of piety and
regulation, but gave his followers a moral code and courage that
supported them well in tribulation, and clothed with a certain nobility
the life of the humblest poor. Among the Roman Jews who prayed to him
were some, as yet obscurely distinguished from the rest, who worshiped
his incarnate and resurrected son.</p>
