<p>The war with Russia — Its political results</p>
<p>T HE death of a civilization seldom comes from without; internal
decay must weaken the fibre of a society before external influences or
at-</p>
<p>tacks can change its essential structure, or bring it to an end. A
ruling fam- ily rarely contains within itself that persistent vitality
and subtle adaptability which enduring domination requires; the founder
exhausts half the strength of the stock, and leaves to mediocrity the
burdens that only genius could bear. The Tokugawas after Iyeyasu
governed moderately well, but, bar- ring Yoshimune, they numbered no
positive personalities in their line. Within eight generations after
Iyeyasu’s death the feudal barons were disturbing the Shogunate with
sporadic revolts; taxes were delayed or withheld, and the Yedo treasury,
despite desperate economies, became inadequate to finance national
security or defense . 1 Two centuries and more of peace had softened the
Samurai , and had disaccustomed the people to the hardships and
sacrifices of war; epicurean habits had displaced the stoic simplicity
of Hideyoshi’s days, and the country, suddenly called upon to protect
its sovereignty, found itself physically and morally unarmed. The
Japanese intellect fretted under the exclusion of foreign intercourse,
and heard with restless curiosity of the rising wealth and varied
civilization of Europe and America; it studied Mabuchi and Moto-ori, and
secretly branded the shoguns as usurpers who had violated the continuity
of the Imperial dynasty; it could not reconcile the divine descent of
the Em- peror with the impotent poverty to which the Tokugawas had
condemned him. From their hiding-places in the Yoshiwara and elsewhere,
subter- ranean pamphleteers began to flood the cities with passionate
appeals for the overthrow of the Shogunate, and the restoration of the
Imperial power.</p>
<p>THE NEW JAPAN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>915</p>
<p>Upon this harassed and resourceless Government the news burst in 1853
that an American fleet, ignoring Japanese prohibitions, had entered
Uraga Bay, and that its commander insisted upon seeing the supreme
authority in Japan. Commodore Perry had four ships of war and 560 men;
but instead of making a display of even this modest force, he sent a
courteous note to the Shogun Iyeyoshi, assuring him that the American
Government asked nothing more than the opening of a few Japanese ports
to American trade, and some arrangements for the protection of such
American seamen as might be shipwrecked on Japanese shores. The T’ai -
p’ing Rebellion called Perry back to his base in Chinese waters; but in
1854 he returned to Japan armed with a larger squadron and a persua-
sive variety of gifts — perfumes, clocks, stoves, whiskey . . . — for
the Emperor, the Empresses, and the princes of the blood. The new Shogun
, Iyesada, neglected to transmit these presents to the royal family, but
con- sented to sign the Treaty of Kanagawa, which conceded in effect all
the American demands. Perry praised the courtesy of the islanders, and
an- nounced, with imperfect foresight, that “if the Japanese came to the
United States they would find the navigable waters of the country free
to them, and that they would not be debarred even from the gold-fields
of California.” 3 By this and later treaties the major ports of Japan
were open to commerce from abroad, tariffs were specified and limited,
and Japan agreed that Europeans and Americans accused of crime in the
islands should be tried by their own consular courts. Stipulations were
made and accepted that all persecution of Christianity should cease in
the Empire; and at the same time the United States offered to sell to
Japan such arms and battleships as she might need, and to lend officers
and craftsmen for the instruction of this absurdly pacific nation in the
arts of war. 3</p>
<p>The Japanese people suffered keenly from the humiliation of these
trea- ties, though later they acknowledged them as the impartial
instruments of evolution and destiny. Some of them wished to fight the
foreigners at any cost, to expel them all, and restore a self-contained
agricultural and feudal regime. Others saw the necessity of imitating
rather than expelling the West; the only course by which Japan could
avoid the repeated defeats and the economic subjection which Europe was
then imposing upon China was by learning as rapidly as possible the
methods of Western in- dustry, and the technique of modem war. With
astonishing finesse the Westernizing leaders used the baronial lords as
aides in overthrowing the Shogunate and restoring the Emperor, and then
used the Imperial au-</p>
<p>91 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>thority to overthrow feudalism and introduce Occidental industry. So
in 1867 the feudal lords persuaded the last of the shoguns, Keiki, to
abdi- cate. “Almost all the acts of the administration,” said Keiki,
“are far</p>
<p>from perfect, and I confess it with shame that the present
unsatisfactory condition of affairs is due to my shortcomings and
incompetence. Now that foreign intercourse becomes daily more extensive,
unless the govern- ment is directed from one central authority, the
foundations of the state will fall to pieces.” 4 The Emperor Meiji
replied tersely that “Tokugawa Keiki’s proposal to restore the
administrative authority to the Imperial Court is accepted”; and on
January 1, 1868 the new “Era of Meiji” was officially begun. The old
religion of Shinto was revised, and an intensive propaganda convinced
the people that the restored emperor was divine in lineage and wisdom,
and that his decrees were to be accepted as the edicts of the gods.</p>
<p>Armed with this new power, the Westernizers achieved almost a mir-
acle in the rapid transformation of their country. Ito and Inouye braved
their way through every prohibition and obstacle to Europe, studied its
industries and institutions, marveled at the railroad, the steamship,
the tele- graph and the battleship, and came back inflamed with a
patriotic resolve to Europeanize Japan. Englishmen were brought in to
superintend the construction of railways, the erection of telegraphs,
and the building of a navy; Frenchmen were commissioned to recast the
laws and train the army; Germans were assigned to the organization of
medicine and public health; Americans were engaged to establish a system
of universal educa- tion; and to make matters complete, Italians were
imported to instruct the Japanese in sculpture and painting. 5 There
were temporary, even bloody, reactions, and at times the spirit of Japan
rebelled against this hectic and artificial metamorphosis; but in the
end the machine had its way, and the Industrial Revolution added Japan
to its realm.</p>
<p>Of necessity that Revolution (the only real revolution in modern his-
tory) lifted to wealth and economic power a new class of men — manu-
facturers, merchants and financiers — who in the old Japan had been
ranked at the very bottom of the social scale. This rising bourgeoisie
quietly used its means and influence first to destroy feudalism, and
then to reduce to an imposing pretense the restored authority of the
throne. In 1871 the Government persuaded the barons to surrender their
ancient privileges, and consoled them with government bonds in exchange
for</p>
<p>THE NEW JAPAN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>917</p>
<p>their lands.* Bound by ties of interest to the new society, the old
aris- tocracy gave its services loyally to the Government, and enabled
it to ef- fect with bloodless ease the transition from a medieval to a
modern state. Ito Hirobumi, recently returned from a second visit to
Europe, created, in imitation of Germany, a new nobility of five orders
— princes, marquises, counts, viscounts and barons; but these men were
the rewarded servants, not the feudal enemies, of the industrial
regime.</p>
<p>Modestly and tirelessly Ito labored to give his country a form of
gov- ernment that would avoid what seemed to him the excesses of
democracy, and yet enlist and encourage the talent of every class for a
rapid economic development. Under his leadership Japan promulgated, in
1889, its first constitution. At the top of the legal structure was the
emperor, tech- nically supreme, owning all land in fee simple, commander
of an army and a navy responsible to him alone, and giving to the Empire
the strength of unity, continuity, and regal prestige. Graciously he
consented to dele- gate his law-making power, so long as it pleased him,
to a Diet of two chambers — a House of Peers and a House of
Representatives; but the min- isters of state were to be appointed by
him, and to be accountable to him rather than to the Diet. Underneath
was a small electorate of some 460,- 000 voters, severely limited by a
property qualification; successive liberal- izations of the franchise
raised the number of voters to 13,000,000 by 1928. Corruption in office
has kept pace with the extension of democracy.*</p>
<p>Along with these political developments went a new system of law</p>
<p>(1881), based largely upon the Napoleonic Code, and representing a
courageous advance on the medieval legislation of the feudal age. Civil
rights were liberally granted — freedom of speech, press, assembly and
wor- ship, inviolability of correspondence and domicile, and security
from arrest or punishment except by due process of law.f Torture and
ordeal were abolished, the Eta were freed from their caste disabilities,
and all classes were made theoretically equal before the law. Prisons
were improved, prisoners were paid for their work, and on their
liberation they were equipped with some modest capital to set them up in
agriculture or trade. Despite the lenience of the code, crime remained
rare; 7 and if an orderly</p>
<ul>
<li>This process corresponded essentially to the abolition of feudalism,
serfdom or slavery in France in 1789, in Russia in 1862, and in the
United States in 1863.</li>
</ul>
<p>t These rights have been narrowly restricted by the war fever of the
Manchurian ad- venture.</p>
<p>918 the story of civilization (chap. XXXI</p>
<p>acceptance of law is a mark of civilization, Japan (allowing for a
few as- sassinations) must stand in the first rank of modern states.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant feature of the new Constitution was the
exemption of the army and the navy from any superior except the Em-
peror. Never forgetting the humiliation of 1853, Japan resolved to build
an armed force that would make her master of her own destiny, and ul-
timately lord of the East. Not only did she establish conscription; she
made every school in the land a military training camp and a nursery of
nationalist ardor. With an amazing aptitude for organization and dis-
cipline, she soon brought her armed power to a point where she could
speak to the “foreign barbarians” on equal terms, and might undertake
that gradual absorption of China which Europe had contemplated but never
achieved. In 1894, resenting the despatch of Chinese troops to put down
an insurrection in Korea, and China’s persistent reference to Korea as a
tributary state under Chinese suzerainty, Japan declared war upon her
ancient tutor, surprised the world with the speed of her victory, and
ex- acted from China the acknowledgment of Korea’s independence, the ces
- sion of Formosa and Port Arthur (at the tip of the Liaotung
Peninsula), and an indemnity of 200,000,000 taels. Germany and France
supported Russia in “advising” Japan to withdraw from Port Arthur on
condition of receiving an additional indemnity of 30,000,000 taels (from
China). Japan yielded, but kept the rebuff in bitter memory while she
waited for revenge.</p>
<p>From that hour Japan prepared herself grimly for that conflict
with</p>
<p>Russia which imperialistic expansion in both empires made apparently
inevitable. Availing herself of England’s fear that Russia might advance
into India, Japan concluded with the mistress of the seas an alliance (
1902-</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>by which each party contracted to come to the aid of its ally in
case either should go to war with a third power, and another power
should in- tervene. Seldom had England’s diplomats signed away so m uch
of Eng- land’s liberty. When, in 1904, the war with Russia began,
English and American bankers lent Japan huge sums to finance her
victories against the Tsar. 8 .Nogi captured Port Arthur, and moved his
army north in time to turn the scales in the slaughter of Mukden — the
bloodiest battle in his tory before our own incomparable Great War.
Germany and France seem to have contemplated coming to the aid of Russia
by diplomacy or arms; but President Roosevelt made it known that in such
case he would</li>

<p>“promptly side with Japan.” 0 Meanwhile a Russian squadron of twenty

<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>nine ships had gallantly sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, in the
longest war-voyage ever made by a modem fleet, to face the Japanese in
their own waters. Admiral Togo, making the first known naval use of
radio, kept himself informed of the Russian flotilla’s course, and
pounced upon it in the Straits of Tsushima on May 27, 1905. To all his
commanders Togo flashed a characteristic message : “The rise or fall of
the Empire de - pends on this battle.” 10 The Japanese lost 1 16 killed
and 538 wounded; the Russians lost 4000 dead and 7000 prisoners, and all
but three of their ships were captured or sunk.</p>
<p>The “Battle of the Sea of Japan” was a turning point in modern
history. Not only did it end the expansion of Russia into Chinese
territory; it</p>
<p>ended also the rale of Europe in the East, and began that
resurrection of Asia which promises to be the central political process
of our century. All Asia took heart at the sight of the little island
empire defeating the most populous power in Europe; China plotted her
revolution, and India began to dream of freedom. As for Japan, it
thought not of extending liberty but of capturing power. It secured from
Russsia an acknowledg- ment of Japan’s paramount position in Korea, and
then, in 1910, formally annexed that ancient and once highly civilized
kingdom. When the Em- peror Meiji died, in 1912, after a long and
benevolent career as ruler, artist and poet, he could take to the
progenitor gods of Japan the message that the nation which they had
created, and which at the outset of his reign had been a plaything in
the hands of the impious West, was now supreme in the Orient, and was
well on its way to becoming the pivot of history.</p>

<p>Japanese point of view</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the course of half a century, Japan had changed every
aspect of its life. The peasant, though poor, was free; he could own a
modest parcel of land by paying an annual tax or rental to the state;
and no lord could hinder him if he chose to leave the fields and seek
his</p>
<p>fortune in the cities. For there were great cities now along the
coast: Tokyo (i.e., the “Eastern Capital”), with its royal and
aristocratic palaces, its spacious parks and crowded baths, and a
population second only to that of London and New York; Osaka, once a
fishing village and a castle, now a dark abyss of hovels, factories and
skyscrapers, the center of the indus-</p>

<p>tries of Japan; and Yokohama and Kobe, from whose gigantic wharves,
equipped with every modem mechanism, those industries despatched to a
thousand ports the second largest merchant marine in the world.*</p>
<p>The leap from feudalism to capitalism was eased by an unprecedented
use of every aid. Foreign experts were brought in, and Japanese
assistants obeyed their instructions eagerly; within fifteen years the
clever learners had made such progress that the foreign specialists were
paid off and courteously sent home. Following the lead of Germany the
Government took over posts, railroads, telegraphs and telephones; but at
the same time it made generous loans to private industries, and
protected them with high tariffs from the competition of factories
abroad. The indemnity paid by the Chinese after the war of 1894 financed
and stimulated the industriali- zation of Japan precisely as the French
indemnity of 1871 had accelerated the industrialization of Germany.
Japan, like the Germany of a genera- tion before, was able to begin with
modern equipment and feudal dis- cipline, while their long-established
competitors struggled with obsolescent machinery and rebellious
workingmen. Power was cheap in Japan, and wages were low; laborers were
loyally submissive to their chiefs; factory laws came late, and were
leniently enforced.“ In 1933 the new Osaka spindles needed one girl for
twenty-five machines; the old Lancashire spindles required one man for
six.“</p>
<p>The number of factories doubled from 1908 to 1918, and again from
1918 to 1924; by 1931 they had increased by fifty per cent more, 14
while industry in the West plumbed the depths of depression. In 1933
Japan took first place as an exporter of textile products, sending out
two of the five-and-a-half billion yards of cotton goods consumed in
that year by the world.“ By abandoning the gold standard in 1931, and
allowing the yen to fall to forty per cent of its former value in
international exchange, Japan increased her foreign sales fifty per cent
from 1932 to 1933. 18 Domestic as well as foreign commerce flourished,
and great merchant families, like the Mitsui and the Mitsubishi, amassed
such fortunes that the military joined the wage-earning classes in
meditating governmental absorption or control of industry and trade,
f</p>
<p>•By the last official census Yokohama had 620,000 population, Kobe
787,000, Osaka 2,114,804, and Greater Tokyo 5,311,000.</p>
<p>f Transport by land did not grow as rapidly as marine trade, for the
mountainous backbone of the islands made commerce prefer the sea. Roads
remained poor by com- parison with the West; and automobiles have only
recently begun to be a peril in Japan.</p>
<p>THE NEW JAPAN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>921</p>
<p>While the growth of commerce generated a new and prosperous mid- dle
class, the manual workers bore the brunt of the low production costs
through which Japan undersold her competitors in the markets of the
world. The average wage of the men in 1931 was .17 a day; of the women,
48 cents a day; 5 1 per cent of the industrial workers were women, and
twelve per cent were under sixteen years of age. 19 * Strikes were
frequent and communism was growing when the war spirit of 1931 turned
the nation to patriotic cooperation and conformity; “dangerous thoughts”
were made illegal, and labor unions, never strong in Japan, were sub-
jected to severe restrictions. 50 Great slums developed in Osaka, Kobe
and Tokyo; in those of Tokyo a family of five occupied an average
room</p>
<p>space of from eight to ten feet square — a trifle more than the area
covered by a double bed; in those of Kobe twenty thousand paupers,
criminals, defectives and prostitutes lived in such filth that each year
epidemics decimated them, and infant mortality rose to four times its
average for the remainder of Japan. 21 Communists like Katayama and
Christian So- cialists like Kagawa fought violently or peaceably against
these conditions, until at last the Government undertook the greatest
slum-clearing project in history..</p>
<p>A generation ago Lafcadio Hearn expressed a bitter judgment upon the
modern regime in Japan:</p>
<p>Under the new order of things forms of social misery never be-</p>
<p>fore known in the history of the race are being developed. Some</p>
<p>idea of this misery may be obtained from the fact that the number</p>
<p>of poor people in Tokyo unable to pay their residence tax is upward
of 50,000; yet the amount of the tax is only about twenty sen, or ten
cents in American money. Prior to the accumulation of wealth in</p>
<p>the hands of the minority there was never any such want in any part
of Japan — except, of course, as a temporary consequence of war. 22</p>
<p>Already, however, the jinricksha, or “man -power-ve hicle,”
traditionally ascribed to an in - ventive American missionary in the
early eighties,” is disappearing before American</p>

<p>922 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>The “accumulation of wealth in the hands of the minority” is, no
doubt, a universal and apparently unfailing concomitant of civilization.
Japanese employers believe that the wages which they pay are not too low
in rela- tion to the comparative inefficiency of Japanese labor, and the
low cost of living in Japan/ 3 Low wages, thinks Japan, are necessary
for low costs; low costs are necessary for the capture of foreign
markets; foreign markets are necessary for an industry dependent upon
imported fuels and minerals; industry is necessary for the support of a
growing population in islands only twelve per cent of whose soil permits
cultivation; and industry is necessary to that wealth and armament
without which Japan could not defend herself against the rapacious
West.</p>

<p>Have the people themselves been changed by their Industrial Revolu-

urban males; but the women continue to clothe themselves in loose and
colorful robes, bound at the waist with brocaded bands that meet in a
spacious bow. at the back.* Shoes are replacing wooden clogs as roads
improve; but a large proportion of both sexes still move about in bare
and undeformed feet. In the greater cities one may find every variation
and combination of native and European dress, as if to symbolize a
transformation hurried and incomplete.</p>

to their ancient custom of preceding women in entering or leaving a room

force and gentleness, levity and gravity, patience and courage, modesty
and pride. Therefore we must not be prejudiced against the Japanese

<p>mental and realistic, sensitive and stoical, expressive and reticent,
excitable and restrained; aboundingly cheerful, humorous and
pleasure-loving, and inclined to picturesque suicide; lovingly kind —
often to animals, some- times to women — and occasionally cruel to
animals and men.* The typical Japanese has all the qualities of the
warrior — pugnacity and cour- age, and an unrivaled readiness to die;
and yet, very often, he has the soul of an artist — sensuous,
impressionable, and almost instinctively possessed of taste. He is sober
and unostentatious, frugal and industrious, curious and . studious,
loyal and patient, with an heroic capacity for details; he is cun- ning
and supple, like most physically small persons; he has a nimble in-
telligence, not highly creative in the field of thought, but capable of
quick comprehension, adaptation, and practical achievement. The spirit
and van- ity of a Frenchman, the courage and narrowness of a Briton, the
hot temper and artistry of an Italian, the energy and commercialism of
an American, the sensitiveness and shrewdness of a Jew — all these have
come together to make the Japanese.</p>
<p>Contact and conflict with the West have altered in some ways the
moral life of Japan. The traditional honesty of its peoplef largely
continues; but the extension of the franchise and the keen competition
of modem trade have brought to Japan a proportionate share of democratic
venality, industrial ruth- lessness and financial legerdemain. Bushido
survives here and there among the higher soldiery, and offers a mild
aristocratic check to commercial and polit- ical deviltry. Despite the
law-abiding patience of the common people assassi- nation is frequent —
not as a corrective of reactionary despotism but usually as an
encouragement to aggressive patriotism. The Black Dragon Society, led by
the apparently untouchable Toyama, has dedicated itself for over forty
years to promoting among Japanese officials a policy of conquest in
Korea and Manchuria;^ and in the pursuit of this purpose it has given
assassination a popular role in the political machinery of Japan .

the chaos that followed the earthquake of 1923 the Japanese of Yokohama,
while being fed by American relief ships, took advantage of the turmoil

<p>The Far East has paralleled the West in that moral disturbance which
ac- companies every profound change in the economic basis of life. The
eternal war of the generations — the revolt of over-eager youth against
over-cautious age — has been intensified by the growth of individualist
industry, and the weakening of religious faith. The transit from country
to city, and the re- placement of the family by the individual as the
legal and responsible unit of economic and political society, has
undermined parental authority, and sub- jected the customs and morals of
centuries to the hasty judgment of adoles- cence. In the larger centers
the young rebel against marriages parentally arranged; and the new
couples, instead of taking up their residence in the • establishment of
the bridegroom’s father, tend increasingly to set up separate</p>
<p>In Japan as elsewhere the machine is the enemy of the priest. Spencer
and Stuart Mill were imported along with English technology, and the
reign of Confucius in Japanese philosophy came to a sudden end. “The
generation now at school,” said Chamberlain in 1905, “is distinctly
Voltairean.” 29 By the same token — through its modern alliance with the
machine — science prospered, and won a characteristic devotion, in
Japan, from some of the most brilliant investigators of our time.*
Japanese medicine, though de- pendent in most stages upon China or
Korea, has made swift progress under European — especially German —
example and stimulus. The work of Takamine in the discovery of adrenalin
and the study of vitamins; of Kitasato in tetanus and pneumonia, and in
the development of an anti-toxin for diphtheria; and, most famous and
brilliant of all, of Noguchi in syphilis and yellow fever — these
achievements indicate the rapidity with which the Japanese have ceased
to be pupils, and have become teachers, of the world.</p>
<p>Hideyo Noguchi was born in 1876 in one of the lesser islands, and in
a family so poor that his father deserted on learning that another child
was due. The neglected boy fell into a brazier; his left hand was burned
to a stump, and his right hand was injured almost to the point of
uselessness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such science as existed in Japan before 1853 was mostly an
importation from the parental mainland. The Japanese calendar,
previously based upon the phases of the moon, was readjusted to the
solar year by a Korean priest about 604 a.d. In 680 a.d. Chinese
modifications were introduced, and Japan took over (and still retains)
the Chinese method of reckoning events by reference to the name and year
of the reigning emperor. The Gregorian calendar was adopted by Japan in
1873.</li>

<p>Shunned at school because of his scars and deformities, he was
planning to kill himself when a surgeon came to the village, treated the
right hand successfully, and so won Noguchi’s gratitu de that the lad
there and then dedicated himself to medicine. “I will be a Napoleon to
save instead of to kill,” he announced; “I can already get along on four
hours of sleep at night.” 30 Penniless, he worked in a pharmacy until he
had persuaded its owner to advance him funds for the study of medicine.
After graduat- ing he came to the United States, and offered his
services to the Medical Corps of the Army at Washington in return for
his expenses. The Rocke- feller Foundation for Medical Research gave him
a laboratory, and</p>
<p>Noguchi, literally single-handed, entered upon a fruitful career of
ex- periment and research. He produced the first pure culture of the
syphi- litic germ, discovered the syphilitic nature of general paralysis
and loco- motor ataxia, and finally (1918) isolated the yellow fever
parasite. Made famous and momentarily affluent, he went back to Japan,
honored his old mother, and knelt in gratitude to the kindly pharmacist
who had paid for his medical education. Then he went to Africa to study
the yellow</p>
<p>fever that was raging along the Gold Coast, was himself infected with
it, and died (1928) at the pitifully early age of fifty-two.</p>
<p>The development of science, in Japan as in the West, has been
accompanied by a decay of the traditional arts. The overthrow of the old
aristocracy destroyed a nursery of taste, and left each generation to
develop its own norms of excellence anew. The influx of foreign money
seeking native wares led to rapid quantitative production, and debased
the standards of Japanese design. When the buyers turned to the quest
for ancient works, the artisans became forgers, and the manufacture of
antiques became in Japan, as in China, one of the most flourishing of
modern arts. Cloisonne is probably the only branch of ceramics that has
progressed in Japan since the coming of the West. The chaotic passage
from handicraft to machinery, and the sudden irruption of foreign tastes
and ways clothed in the gaudy prestige of victory and wealth, have
unsettled the esthetic sense of Japan, and weakened the sure- ness of
her taste. Perhaps, now that Japan has chosen the sword, she is destined
to repeat the history of Rome — imitative in art, but masterly in ad-
ministration and war.*</p>

intellectual life of the new empire. European words crowded into the

<p>papers were organized in Western style, and a system of public
schools was established after American exemplars. Japan heroically
resolved to make itself the most literate nation on earth, and it
succeeded; in 1925 99.4 per cent of all Japanes e children attended
school,” and in 1927, 93 per cent of the people could read.” Students
took religiously to the new secular learning; hundreds of them lost
their health in their eagerness for knowledge,” and the Government was
obliged to take active measures for the encouragement of athletics,
gymnastics and games of every kind from ju-jitsu to baseball. Edu-
cation was removed from religious auspices, and became more thoroughly
secularized in Japan than in most European nations. Five imperial
universities were supported, and forty-one other universities, only less
imperial, gathered in thousands of zealous students. By 1931 the
Imperial University of Tokyo had 8,064 students, and the University of
Kyoto had 5,552.”</p>
<p>Japanese literature, in the last quarter of the century, lost itself
in a</p>
<p>series of imitative fashions. English liberalism, Russian realism,
Nietz - schean individualism and American pragmatism swept the
intelligentsia in turn, until the spirit of nationalism reasserted
itself, and Japanese writers began to explore their native material in
their native ways. A young</p>
<p>woman, Ichi-yo, before dying in 1896 at the age of twenty-four,
inaugur- ated a naturalistic movement in fiction by presenting vividly
the misery and subjection of wo men in Japan.” In 1906 the poet Toson
brought this movement to its height with a long novel — Hakai or “The
Breaking of the Pledge”— which told in poetic prose the story of a
teacher who, hav- ing promised his father never to reveal the fact that
he was of Eta or slave origin, worked his way by ability and education
to a high position, fell in love with a girl of refinement and social
standing, and then, in a burst of honesty, confessed his origin,
surrendered his sweetheart and his place, and left Japan forever. This
novel contributed powerfully to the agitation that finally ended the
historic disabilities of the Eta class.</p>
<p>The tanka and the hokka were the last forms of Japanese culture
to</p>
<p>yield to the influence of the West. For forty years after the
Restoration they continued to be the required modes of Japanese verse,
and the poetic spirit lost itself in miracles of ingenuity and artifice.
Then, in 1897, Toson, a young teacher of Sendai, sold to a publisher,
for fifteen dollars, a volume of poems whose individual length
constituted a revolution almost as star- tling as any that had shaken
the fabric of the state. The public, tired of ele- gant epigrams,
responded gratefully, and made the publisher rich. Other</p>

<p>poets followed the path that Toson had explored, and the tanka and
hokka surrendered at last their thousand-year-old domination. 30</p>
<p>Despite the new forms the old Imperial Poetry Contest still
continues. Every year the Emperor announces a theme, and sets an example
by indit- ing an ode to it; the Empress follows him; and then
twenty-five thousand Japanese, of every sort and condition, send in
their compositions to the Poetry Bureau at the Imperial Palace, to be
judged by the highest bards of the land. The ten poems accounted best
are read to the Emperor and the Empress, and are printed in the New
Year’s issue of the Japanese press. 37 It is an admirable custom, fit to
turn the soul for a moment from commercialism and war, and proving that
Japanese literature is still a vital part in the life of the most vital
nation in the contemporary world.</p>

<p>Despite its rapid growth in wealth and power the new Japan rested</p>
<p>upon precarious foundations. Its population had mounted from 3,000,-
000 in the days of Shotoku Taishi to some 17,000,000 under Hideyoshi,
some 30,000,000 under Yoshimune, and over 55,000,000 at the end of
Meiji’s reign (1912).* It had doubled in a century, and the mountain -
ribbed islands, so sparsely arable, contained with difficulty their
multiply- ing millions. An insular population half as great as that of
the United States had to support itself on an area one-twentieth as
large. 38 It could maintain itself only by manufactures; and yet Japan
was tragically poor in the fuels and minerals indispensable to industry.

<li>In 1934 the population of the Japanese Empire (i.e., Japan, Korea,
Formosa and some minor possessions) totaled eighty millions. Should
Japan succeed in reconciling the in- habitants of Manchuria to Japanese
rule, it will control, for industry and war, 110,000,000 people. As the
population of Japan alone increases by a million a year, and that of the
United States is rapidly approaching a stationary condition, the two
systems may soon confront each other with approximately equal
populations.</li>

<p>lurked in the streams that flowed from the mountains to the sea, but
the full development of this resource would add only one-third to the
power already used,“ and could not be relied upon for the expanding
needs of the future. Coal was found here and there, in almost
inaccessible veins, in the islands of Kyushu and Hokkaido, and oil could
be secured from Sakhalin; but iron, the very bone and sinew of industry,
was almost completely absent from Japanese soil.“ Finally, the low
standard of living to which the nature of the strong and the costliness
of materials and power had condemned the masses of Japan made
consumption lag more and more behind production; every year, from
factories ever better equipped, there poured forth a mounting surplus of
goods unpurchasable at home and crying out for markets abroad.</p>
<p>Out of such conditions imperialism is bom — that is, the effort of
an</p>
<p>economic system to exercise control, through its agent the
government, over foreign regions upon which it is believed to depend for
fuels, markets, materials or dividends. Where could Japan find those
opportunities and those materials? She could not look to Indo-China, or
India, or Australia, or the Philippines; for these had been preempted by
Western powers, and their tariff walls favored their white masters
against Japan. Clearly China had been placed at Nippon’s door as a
providentially designed market for Japanese goods; and Manchuria — rich
in coal and iron, rich in the wheat that the islands could not
profitably grow, rich in human resources for industry, taxation and war
— Manchuria belonged by manifest destiny to Japan. By what right? By the
same right whereby England had taken India and Australia, France
Indo-China, Germany Shantung, Russia Port Arthur, and America the
Philippines — the right of the need of the strong. In the long run no
excuses would be necessary; all that was needed was power and an
opportunity. In the eyes of a Darwinian world success would sanction
every means.</p>
<p>Opportunity came generously — first with the Great War, then with</p>
<p>the breakdown of European and American economic life. The War did not
merely accelerate production in Japan (as in America) by giving to
industry an ideal foreign market — a continent at war; at the same time
it absorbed and weakened Europe, and left Japan with almost a free hand
in the East. Therefore she invaded Shantung in 1914; and a year later
she presented to China those “Twenty - one Demands” which, if they had
been enforced, would have made all China a gigantic colony of little
Japan. Group I of the Demands asked Chinese recognition of Japanese
su-</p>
<p>zerainty in Shantung; Group II asked certain industrial privileges,
and an</p>
<p>THE NEW JAPAN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>929</p>
<p>acknowledgment of Japan’s special rights, in Manchuria and Eastern
Mongolia; Group III proposed that the greatest of mining companies on
the mainland should become a joint concern of China and Japan; Group IV
(aimed at America’s request for a coaling station near Foochow)</p>
<p>stipulated that “no island, port or harbor along the coast shall be
ceded to any third Power.” Group V modestly suggested that the Chinese
should hereafter employ Japanese advisers in their political, economic
and mili- tary affairs; that the police authority in the major cities of
China should be jointly administered by Chinese and Japanese; that China
should pur- chase at least fifty per cent of all her munitions from
Japan; that Japan should be allowed to build three important railways in
China; and that Japan should have the right freely to establish
railways, mines and har- bors in the Province of Fukien.“</p>
<p>The United States protested that some of these Demands violated the
territorial integrity of China, and the principle of the Open Door.
Japan withdrew Group V, modified the remaining Demands, and presented
them to China with an ultimatum on May 7, 1915. China accepted them on
the following day. A Chinese boycott of Japanese goods ensued; but Japan
proceeded on the historically correct assumption that boycotts are
sooner or later frustrated by the tendency of trade to follow the line
of lowest costs. In 1917 the suave Viscount Ishii explained the Japanese
position to the American people, and persuaded Secretary of State
Lansing to sign an agreement recognizing “that Japan has special
interests in China, par - ticularly in the part to which her possessions
are contiguous.” In 1922, at the Washington Conference, Secretary of
State Hughes prevailed upon the Japanese to acknowledge the principle of
the “Open Door” in China, and to be content with a navy sixty per cent
as large as England’s or</p>
<p>America’s.* At the close of the Conference Japan agreed to return to
China that part of Shantung (Tsingtao) which she had taken from Ger-
many during the War. The Anglo- Japanese Alliance died a silent death,
and America dreamed cozily of eternal peace.</p>
<p>Out of this youthful confidence in the future came one of the gravest
failures of American diplomacy. Finding the people of the Pacific Coast
troubled by the influx of Japanese into California, President Theodore
Roosevelt in 1907, with the good sense that hid behind his popular
bluster, quietly negotiated with the Japanese Government a “Gentlemen’s

<p>ment” by which Japan promised to forbid the emigration of her
laborers to the United States. But the high birth rate of those already
admitted continued to disturb the western states, and several of them
enacted laws preventing aliens from acquiring land. When, in 1924, the
American Congress decided to restrict immigration, it refused to apply
to the races of Asia that principle of quotas on which the reduced
immigration of European peoples was to be allowed;* instead it forbade
the entrance of Asiatics altogether. Approximately the same result would
have been se- cured by applying the quota to all races, without
discrimination or name; and Secretary Hughes protested “that the
legislation would seem to be quite unnecessary even for the purpose for
which it is devised.” 43 But hot-heads interpreted as a threat the
warning uttered by the Japanese Am- bassador of the “grave consequences”
that might come from the act; and in a fever of resentment the
Immigration Bill was passed.</p>
<p>All Japan flared up at what appeared to be a deliberate insult.
Meetings were held, speeches were made, and a patriot committed
hara-kiri at the door of Viscount Inouye’s home in order to e xpress the
national sense of shame. The Japanese leaders, knowing that the country
had been weak- ened by the earthquake of 1923, held their peace and
bided their time. In the natural course of events America and Europe
would some day be weakened in turn; and then Japan would seize her
second opportunity, and take her delayed revenge.</p>
<p>When the greatest of all wars was followed by almost the greatest of
all depressions, Japan saw a long-awaited chance to establish her
mastery in the Far East. Announcing that her businessmen had been
maltreated by the Chinese authorities in Manchuria, and secretly fearful
that her rail- way and other investments there were threatened with ruin
by the compe- tition of the Chinese, Japan, in September, 1931, allowed
her army, of its own initiative, to advance into Manchuria. China,
disordered with revolu- tion, provincial separatism and purchasable
politicians, could make no uni- fied resistance except to resort again
to the boycott of Japanese goods; and when Japan, in alleged protest
against boycott propaganda, invaded Shang- hai (1932), only a fraction
of China rose to repel the invasion. The ob- jections of the United
States were cautiously approved of “in principle” by European powers too
absorbed in their individual commercial interests</p>
<ul>

bear the same ratio to the total of permitted annual immigration as

<p>to take decisive and united action against this dramatic termination
of the white man’s brief authority in the distant East. The League of
Nations ap - pointed a commission under the Earl of Lytton, which made
an apparently thorough and impartial investigation and report; but Japan
withdrew from the League on the same ground on which America, in 1935,
refused to join in the World Court — that she did not care to be judged
by a court of her enemies. The boycott reduced Japanese imports into
China by forty- seven per cent between August, 1932, and May, 1933; but
meanwhile Japanese trade was ousting Chinese commerce in the
Philippines, the Malay States and South Seas, and, so soon as 1934,
Japanese diplomats, with the aid of Chinese statesmen, persuaded China
to write a tariff law favoring Japanese products as against those of the
Western powers. 43</p>
<p>In March, 1932, Japanese authority installed Henry P’u Yi, inheritor
of the Manchu throne in China, as Chief Executive of the new state of
Man- chukuo; and two years later it made him Emperor under the name of
Kang Teh. The officials were either Japanese or complaisant Chinese; but
be- hind every Chinese official was a Japanese adviser. 44 While the
“Open Door” was technically maintained, ways were found to place
Man-</p>
<p>chukuoan trade and resources in Japanese hands. 45 Immigration from
Japan failed to develop, but Japanese capital poured in abundantly.
Rail- ways were built for commercial and military purposes, highways
were rapidly improved, and negotiations were begun for the purchase of
the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet. The Japanese army,
victorious and competent, not only organized the new state, but dictated
the policy of the Government at Tokyo. It conquered the province of
Jehol for</p>
<p>Pu-yi, advanced almost to Peiping, retreated magnanimously, and bided
its time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Japanese representatives at Nanking strain every yen to win
from the Chinese Government an acceptance of Japanese leadership in
every economic and political aspect of Chinese life. When China has been
won, by conquest or by loans, Japan will be ready to deal with her
ancient enemy — once the Empire of all the Russias, now the Union of
Soviet So- cialist Republics. Up along Mongolia’s caravan route through
Kalgan and Urga, or across the Manchukuoan border into Chita, or at any
one of a hundred vulnerable points where the Trans-Siberian Railway,
still for the most part single-tracked in the Far East, coils itself
about the new state, the Japanese army may strike and cut the spinal
cord that binds China, Vladi- vostok and Trans-Baikalia with the Russian
capital. Feverishly, heroically,</p>
<p>932 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Russia prepares for the irrepressible conflict. At Kuznetzk and
Magneto- gorsk she develops great coal mines and steel factories,
capable of being transformed into giant munition plants; while at
Vladivostok a host of submarines arranges to entertain a Japanese fleet,
and hundreds of bomb- ing planes have their eyes on Japan’s centers of
production and transport, and her cities of flimsy wood.</p>
<p>Behind this ominous foreground stand the tamed and frustrated Western
powers: America chafing at the loss of Chinese markets, France wonder-
ing how long she can hold Indo-China, England disturbed about Australia
and India, and harassed by Japanese competition not only in China but
throughout her empire in the East. Nevertheless France prefers to help
finance Japan rather than to antagonize her; and canny Britain waits in
unprecedented patience, hoping that each of her great competitors in
Asiatic trade will destroy the other and leave the world to England
again. Every day the conflict of interest becomes more acute, and
approaches nearer to open strife. Japan insists that foreign companies
selling oil to Japan shall maintain on her soil a reserve of oil
sufficient to supply the islands for half a year in case of emergency.
Manchukuo is closing her doors to non-Japanese oil. Japan, over the
protests of Americans, and over the veto of the Uruguayan President, has
won permission from the legislature of Uruguay to build on the River
Plate a free port for the duti- less entry or manufacture of Japanese
goods. From that strategic center the commercial and financial
penetration of Latin America will proceed at a rate unequaled since
Germany’s rapid conquest of South American trade helped to br ing on the
Great War, and America’s participation in it. As the memory of that war
begins to fade, preparations for another be- come the order of the
day.</p>
<p>Must America fight Japan? Our economic system gives to the investing
rlacs so generous a share of the wealth created by science, management
and labor that too little is left to the mass of producers to enable
them to buy back as much as they produce; a surplus of goods is created
which cries out for the conquest of foreign markets as the only
alternative to inter- rupting production — or spreading the power of
consumption — at home. But this is even truer of the Japanese economic
system than of our own; it too must conquer foreign markets, not only to
maintain its centralized wealth, but to secure the fuels and raw
materials indispensable to her in- dustries. By the sardonic irony of
history that same Japan which America awoke from peaceful agriculture in
1853, and prodded into industry and</p>

<p>trade, now turns all her power and subtlety to winning by
underselling, and to controlling by conquest or diplomacy, precisely
those Asiatic markets upon which America has fixed her hopes as
potentially the richest outlet for her surplus goods. Usually in
history, when two nations have contested for the same markets, the
nation that has lost in the economic competition, if it is stronger in
resources and armament, has made war upon its enemy.*</p>

<p>OUR ORIENTAL HERITAGE</p>
<p>We have passed in unwilling haste through four thousand years of his-
tory, and over the richest civilizations of the largest continent. It is
impossi- ble that we have understood these civilizations, or done them
justice; for how can one mind, in one lifetime, comprehend or appraise
the heritage of a race? The institutions, customs, arts and morals of a
people represent the natural selection of its countless trial-and-error
experiments, the accumu- lated and unformulable wisdom of all its
generations; and neither the in- telligence of a philosopher nor the
intellect of a sophomore can suffice to compass them understandingly,
much less to judge them with justice. Europe and America are the spoiled
child and grandchild of Asia, and have never quite realized the wealth
of their pre-classical inheritance. But if, now, we sum up those arts
and ways which the West has derived from the East, or which, to our
current and limited knowledge, appear first in the Orient, we shall find
ourselves drawing up unconsciously an outline of civilization.</p>
<p>The first element of civilization is labor — tillage, industry,
transport and trade. In Egypt and Asia we meet with the oldest known
cultivation of the soil,* the oldest irrigation systems, and the firstf
production of those encouraging beverages without which, apparently,
modem civilization could hardly exist — beer and wine and tea.
Handicrafts and engineering were as highly developed in Egypt before
Moses as in Europe before Voltaire; building with bricks has a history
at least as old as Sargon I; the potter’s wheel and the wagon wheel
appear first in Elam, line n and glass in Egypt, silk and gunpowder in
China. The horse rides out of Central Asia into Mesopotamia, Egypt and
Europe; Phoenician vessels circum- navigate Africa before the age of
Pericles; the compass comes from China and produces a commercial
revolution in Europe. Sumeria shows us the first business contracts, the
first credit system, the first use of gold and</p>

<p>silver as standards of value; and China first accomplishes the
miracle of having paper accepted in place of silver or gold.</p>
<p>The second element of civilization is government — the organization
and protection of life and society through the clan and the family, law
and the state. The village community appears in India, and the
city-state in</p>
<p>Sumeria and Assyria. Egypt takes a census, levies an income tax, and
maintains internal peace through many centuries with a model minimum of
force. Ur-Engur and Hammurabi formulate great codes of law, and Darius
organizes, with imperial army and post, one of the best administered
empires in the annals of government.</p>
<p>The third element of civilization is morality — customs and manners,
con- science and charity; a law built into the spirit, and generating at
last that sense of right and wrong, that order and discipline of desire,
without which a society disintegrates into individuals, and falls
forfeit to some coherent state. Courtesy came out of the ancient courts
of Egypt, Meso- potamia and Persia; even today the Far East might teach
manners and dignity to the brusque and impatient West. Monogamy appeared
in Egypt, and began a long struggle to prove itself and survive in
competition with the inequitable but eugenic polygamy of Asia. Out of
Egypt came the first cry for social justice; out of Judea the first plea
for human brother- hood, the first formulation of the moral
consciousness of mankind.</p>
<p>The fourth element of civilization is religion — the use of man’s
super - natural beliefs for the consolation of suffering, the elevation
of character, and the strengthening of social instincts and order. From
Sumeria, Baby- lonia and Judea the most cherished myths and traditions
of Europe were derived; in the soil of the Orient grew the stories of
the Creation and the Flood, the Fall and Redemption of man; and out of
many mother goddesses came at last “the fairest flower of all poesy,” as
Heine called Mary, the</p>
<p>The fifth element in civilization is science — clear seeing, exact
recording, impartial testing, and the slow accumulation of a knowledge
objective enough to generate prediction and control. Egypt develops
arithmetic and geometry, and establishes the calendar; Egyptian priests
and physicians practise medicine, explore diseases enematically, perform
a hundred va- rieties of surgical operation, and anticipate something of
the Hippocratic oath. Babylonia studies the stars, charts the zodiac,
and gives us our di-</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>936</p>
<p>vision of the month into four weeks, of the clock into twelve hours,
of the hour into sixty minutes, of the minute into sixty seconds. India
trans- mits through the Arabs her simple numerals and magical decimals,
and teaches Europe the subtleties of hypnotism and the technique of
vacci- nation.</p>
<p>The sixth element of civilization is philosophy — the attempt of man
to capture something of that total perspective which in his modest
intervals he knows that only Infinity can possess; the brave and
hopeless inquiry into the first causes of things, and their final
significance; the consideration of truth and beauty, of virtue and
justice, of ideal men and states. All this appears in the Orient a
little sooner than in Europe: the Egyptians and the Babylonians ponder
human nature and destiny, and the Jews write im- mortal comments on life
and death, while Europe tarries in barbarism; the Hindus play with logic
and epistemology at least as early as Parmenides and Zeno of Elea; the
Upanishads delve into metaphysics, and Buddha propounds a very modem
psychology some centuries before Socrates is born. And if India drowns
philosophy in religion, and fails to emancipate reason from hope, China
resolutely secularizes her thought, and produces, again before Socrates,
a thinker whose sober wisdom needs hardly any change to be a guide to
our contemporary life, and an inspiration to those who would honorably
govern states.</p>
<p>The seventh element of civilization is letters — the transmission of
lan- guage, the education of youth, the development of writing, the
creation of poetry and drama, the stimulus of romance, and the written
remem- brance of things past. The oldest schools known to us are those
of Egypt and Mesopotamia; even the oldest schools of government are
Egyptian. Out of Asia, apparently, came writing; out of Egypt the
alphabet, paper and ink; out of China, print. The Babylonians seem to
have compiled the oldest grammars and dictionaries, and to have
collected the first libraries; and it may well be that the universities
of India preceded Plato’s Academy. The Assyrians polished chronicles
into history, the Egyptians puffed up history into the epic, and the Far
East gave to the modem world those delicate forms of poetry that rest
all their excellence on subtle insights phrased in a moment’s imagery.
Nabonidus and Ashurbanipal, whose relics are exhumed by archeologists,
were archeologists; and some of the fables that amuse our children go
back to ancient India.</p>
<p>The eighth element of civilization is art — the embellishment of life
with pleasing color, rhythm and form. In its simplest aspect — the
adornment of</p>
<p>ENVOI</p>
<p>937</p>
<p>the body — we find elegant clothing, exquisite jewelry and scandalous
cos- metics in the early ages of Egyptian, Sumerian and Indian
civilization. Fine furniture, graceful pottery, and excellent carving in
ivory and wood fill the Egyptian tombs. Surely the Greeks must have
learned something of their skill in sculpture and architecture, in
painting and bas-relief, not only from Asia and Crete, but from the
masterpieces that in their day still gleamed in the mirror of the Nile.
From Egypt and Mesopotamia Greece took the models for her Doric and
Ionic columns; from those same lands came to us not merely the column
but the arch, the vault, the clerestory and the dome; and the ziggurats
of the ancient Near East have had some share in moulding the
architecture of America today. Chinese painting and Japanese prints
changed the tone and current of nineteenth century European art; and
Chinese porcelain raised a new perfection for Europe to emulate. The
sombre splendor of the Gregorian chant goes back age by age to the
plaintive songs of exiled Jews gathering timidly in scattered
synagogues.</p>
<p>These are some of the elements of civilization, and a part of the
legacy of the East to the West.</p>
<p>Nevertheless much was left for the classic world to add to this rich
in- heritance. Crete would build a civilization almost as ancient as
Egypt’s, and would serve as a bridge to bind the cultures of Asia,
Africa and</p>
<p>Greece. Greece would transform art by seeking not size but
perfection; it would marry a feminine delicacy of form and finish to the
masculine architecture and statuary of Egypt, and would provide the
scene for the greatest age in the history of art. It would apply to all
the realms of</p>
<p>literature the creative exuberance of the free mind; it would
contribute meandering epics, profound tragedies, hilarious comedies and
fascinating histories to the store of European letters. It would
organize universities, and establish for a brilliant interlude the
secular independence of thought; it would develop beyond any precedent
the mathematics and astronomy, the physics and medicine, bequeathed it
by Egypt and the East; it would originate the sciences of life, and the
naturalistic view of man; it would bring philosophy to consciousness and
order, and would consider with unaided rationality all the problems of
our life; it would emancipate the educated classes from ecclesiasticism
and superstition, and would attempt a morality independent of
supernatural aid. It would conceive man as a citizen rather than as a
subject; it would give him political liberty, civil</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>938</p>
<p>rights, and an unparalleled measure of mental and moral freedom; it
would create democracy and invent the individual.</p>
<p>Rome would take over this abounding culture, spread it throughout the
Mediterranean world, protect it for half a millennium from barbarian as-
sault, and then transmit it, through Roman literature and the Latin lan-
guages, to northern Europe; it would lift woman to a power and splendor,
and a mental emancipation, which perhaps she had never known before; it
would give Europe a new calendar, and teach it the principles of
political organization and social security; it would establish the
rights of the indi- vidual in an orderly system of laws that would help
to hold the continent together through centuries of poverty, chaos and
superstition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Near East and Egypt would blossom again under the
stimulus of Greek and Roman trade and thought. Carthage would revive all
the wealth and luxury of Sidon and Tyre; the Talmud would accumu- late
in the hands of dispersed but loyal Jews; science and philosophy would
flourish at Alexandria, and out of the mixture of European and Oriental
cultures would come a religion destined in part to destroy, in part to
preserve and augment, the civilization of Greece and Rome. Every- thing
was ready to produce the culminating epochs of classical antiquity:
Athens under Pericles, Rome under Augustus, and Jerusalem in the age of
Herod. The stage was set for the three-fold drama of Plato, Caesar, and
Christ.</p>
