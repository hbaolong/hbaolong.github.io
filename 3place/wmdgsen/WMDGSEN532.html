<h4 id="chapter-xiv-music-reformed">CHAPTER XIV Music Reformed</h4>
<p>W E do not readily think of the embattled Joseph II as a musician.
Yet we are told that he received a “thorough musical education,” had
a</p>
<p>fine bass voice, heard a concert almost daily, and was “a skillful
player from score” on the violoncello, the viola, and the clavier. 1
Many nobles wer e musi- cians, many more were patrons of music. The
middle classes followed suit; every household had a harpsichord;
everyone learned to play some instru- ment. Trios and quartets were
performed in the streets; open-air concerts were given in the parks and,
on St. John’s Day, from illuminated boats on the Danube Canal. Opera
flourished at the court and in the National Opera Theater founded by
Joseph II in 1778.</p>
<p>Vienna rose to its early-nineteenth-century sovereignty as the
musical cap- ital of Europe because in the late eighteenth century it
brought together the rival musical traditions of Germany and Italy. From
Germany came polyph- ony, from Italy melody. From Germany came the
Singspiel — a mixture of comic drama, spoken dialogue, incidental music,
and popular songs; from Italy came opera buff a; at Vienna the two forms
coalesced, as in Mozart’s The Abduction from the Seraglio. Generally the
Italian influence overcame the German in Vienna; Italy conquered Austria
with arias, as Austria con- quered North Italy with arms. In Vienna
opera seria was chiefly Italian until Gluck came, and Gluck was formed
on Italian music.</p>
<p>I. CHRISTOPH WILLIBALD GLUCK: 1 7 1 4 — 8 7</p>
<p>He was born at Erasbach, in the Upper Palatinate, to a Catholic
forester who in 1717 moved the family to Neuschloss in Bohemia. In the
Jesuit school at Komotau Christoph received instruction in religion,
Latin, the classics, singing, violin, organ, and harpsichord. Moving to
Prague in 1732, he took lessons on the violoncello, and supported
himself by singing in churches, playing the violin at dances, and giving
concerts in nearby towns.</p>
<p>Every clever boy in Bohemia gravitated to Prague, and some still
cleverer found a way to Vienna. Gluck’s way was to sec ure a place in
the orchestra of Prince Ferdinand von Lobkowitz. In Vienna he heard
Italian operas, and felt the magnetism of Italy. Prince Francesco Melzi
liked his playing, and in- vited him to Milan (1737). Gluck studied
composition under Sammartini, and became devoted to Italian styles. His
early operas (1741-45) followed Italian methods, and he conducted their
premieres in Italy. These successes won him an invitation to compose and
produce an opera for the Haymarket Theatre in London.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>There he presented La caduta de ’ giganti (1746). It was dismissed
with faint praise, and gruff old Handel said that Gluck knew “no more
counter - point than mein cook”; 2 but the cook was a good basso and
Gluck’s fame was not to rest on counterpoint. Burney met Gluck, and
described him as “of a temper as fierce as Handel’s…. He was horribly
scarred by smallpox,… and he had an ugly scowl.” 3 Perhaps to balance
his budget Gluck announced to the p ublic that he would give “a concerto
on twenty -six drinking glasses tuned [by filling them to different
levels] with spring water, accompanied with the whole band [orchestra],
being a new instrument of his own inven- tion, upon which he performs
whatever may be done on a violin or harpsi- chord.” Such a “glass
harmonica,” or “musical glasses,” had been introduced in Dublin two
years before. Gluck evoked the notes by stroking the rims of the glasses
with moistened fingers. The performance (April 23, 1746) ap- pealed to
the curious, and was repeated a week later.</p>
<p>Saddened with this success, Gluck left London December 26 for Paris.
There he studied the operas of Rameau, who had moved toward reform by
integrating the music and the ballet with the action. In September he
con- ducted operas at Hamburg, had a liaison with an Italian singer, and
con- tracted syphilis. He recovered so slowly that when he went to
Copenhagen (November 24) he was unable to conduct. He returned to
Vienna, and mar- ried Marianne Pergia (September 15, 1750), daughter of
a rich merchant. Her dowry made him financially secure; he took a house
in Vienna, and dis- appeared into a long rest.</p>
<p>In September, 1754, Count Marcello Durazzo engaged him as Kapell-
meister at two thousand florins per year to compose for the court.
Durazzo had tired of conventional Italian opera, and collaborated with
Gluck in a musical drama, Uinnocenza giustificata , in which the story
was no mere scaffolding for music, and the music no mere assemblage of
arias, but the music reflected the action, and the arias — even the
choruses — entered with some logic into the plot. The premiere (December
8, 1755) was therefore the herald and first product of the reform that
history associates with Gluck’s name. We have seen elsewhere the
contributions made by Benedetto</p>
<p>One secret of success is to seize a propitious chance. What was it
that brought Gluck to abandon the librettos of Metastasio and take
Raniero da Calzabigi as the poet for Orfeo ed Euridice? The two men had
been born</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV )</p>
<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>369</p>
<p>in the same year, 1714, but far apart — Calzabigi in Livorno. After
some ad- ventures in love and finance he came to Paris, published there
an edition of Metastasio’s Poesie drammatiche (1755), and prefaced it
with a “Disserta - zione” expressing his hope for a new kind of opera—
“a delightful whole resulting from the interplay of a large chorus, the
dance, and a scenic action where poetry and music are united in a
masterly way.” 6 Moving to Vienna, he interested Durazzo with his ideas
on opera; the Count invited him to write a libretto; Calzabigi composed
Orfeo ed Euridice; Durazzo offered the poem to Gluck, who saw in the
simple and unified plot a theme that could elicit all his powers.</p>
<p>The result was presented to Vienna on October 5, 1762. For the role
of Orpheus Gluck was able to secure the leading castrato contralto of
the time, Gaetano Guadagni. The story was as old as opera; a dozen
librettists had used it between 1600 and 1761; the audience could follow
the action without un- derstanding Italian. The music dispensed with
unaccompanied recitatives, da capo arias, and decorative flourishes;
otherwise it followed the Italian style, but it rose to lyric heights of
a purity seldom attained before or since. The despondent cry of Orpheus
after losing his beloved a second time to death — “Che faro senz’
Euridice?”— is still the loveliest aria in opera; on hear- ing this, and
the threnody of the flute in the “Dance of the Blessed Spirits,” we
wonder that the stormy Bohemian could have found such delicacy in his
soul.</p>
<p>Orfeo was not enthusiastically received in Vienna, but Maria Theresa
was deeply moved by it, and sent Gluck a snuffbox stuffed with ducats.
Soon he was chosen to teach singing to the Archduchess Maria Antonia.
Meanwhile he and Calzabigi worked on what some have rated their most
perfect opera, Alceste. In a preface to the published form, written for
Gluck by Calzabigi, the composer declared the principles of his operatic
reform:</p>
<p>When I undertook to write the music for Alceste I resolved to divest
it en- tirely of all those abuses… which have so long disfigured Italian
opera…. I have striven to restrict music to its true office of serving
poetry by means of expression, and by following the situations of the
story, without interrupting the action or stifling it with useless
superfluity of comments…. I did not think it my duty to pass quickly
over the second section of an aria — of which the words are perhaps the
most impassioned and important — in order to repeat regularly… those of
the first part…. I have felt that the overture should apprize the
spectators of the nature of the action that is to be represented, and to
form, so to speak, its argument;… that the orchestral instruments should
be introduced in proportion to the interest and intensity of the words,
and not leave that sharp contrast between the aria and the recitative in
the dialogue,… [which] wantonly disturbs the force and heat of the
action…. I believed that my greatest labor should be devoted to seeking
a beautiful simplicity. 7</p>
<p>In short, the music was to serve and intensify the drama, and not
make the drama a mere scaffolding for vocal or orchestral displays.
Gluck put the matter extremely by saying that he was “trying to forget
that I am a musi - cian”; 8 he was to be one person with the librettist
in composing a dramma per</p>
<p>370 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>with a somber overture that prefigured and led into the tragic
action; with scenes of touching sentiment between Alceste and her
children; with her invocation to the underworld gods in the aria
“Divinites du Styx”; with majestic chorales and spectacular ensembles.
The Viennese audience gave the opera sixty hearings between its
premiere, December 16, 1767, and 1779. The critics, however, found many
faults in it, and the singers complained that it gave them insufficient
scope to display their art.</p>
<p>Poet and composer tried again with Paride ed Elena (November 30,
1770). Calzabigi took the plot from Ovid, who had made the story of
Paris and Helen a personal romance instead of an international tragedy.
The work received twenty performances in Vienna, one in Naples, none
elsewhere. Calzabigi assumed the blame for the comparative failure, and
renounced the writing of librettos. Gluck sought other soil for his
seed. A friend in the French embassy at Vienna, Francois du Rollet,
suggested that Paris audiences might welcome the compliment of a French
opera by a German composer. Following suggestions by Diderot and
Algarotti that Racine’s Iphigenie offered an ideal subject for an opera,
Du Rollet molded the play into a li- bretto, and submitted this to
Gluck. The composer found the material per- fectly suited to his taste,
and at once set to work.</p>
<p>To pave the way to Paris Du Rollet addressed to the director of the
Opera a letter — printed in the Mercure de France for August 1, 1772 —
telling how indignant “Monsieur Glouch” was at the idea tha t the French
language did not lend itself to music, and how he proposed to prove the
opposite with Iphigenie en Aulide. Gluck softened the expected ire of
Rousseau (then living quietly in Paris) by sending the Mercure a letter
(February 1, 1773) ex- pr essing his hope that he might consult with
Rousseau about “the means I have in view to produce a music fit for all
the nations, and to let the ridicu- lous distinctions of national music
disappear.” 9 To complete this masterpiece</p>
<p>A great triumph, my dear Christine! I am carried away with it, and
people can no longer talk of anything else. All heads are fermenting as
a result of this event;… there are dissensions and quarrels as though it
were… some reli- gious dispute. At court, though I publicly expressed
myself in favor of this in- spired work, there are partisanships and
debates of a particular liveliness; and in the city it seems to be worse
still. 11</p>
<p>Rousseau repaid Gl uck’s advances by announcing that “Monsieur
Gluck’s opera had overturned all his ideas; he was now convinced that
the French</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>language could agree as well as any other with a music powerful,
touching, and sensitive.” 12 The overture was so startlingly beautiful
that the first night’s audience demanded its repetition. The arias were
criticized as too many, interrupting the drama, but they were marked by
a complex depth of feeling characteristic of Glu ck’s music; of one of
them, Agamemnon’s “Au faite des grandeurs,” Abbe Arnaud exclaimed, “With
such an air one might found a religion.” 13</p>
<p>Gluck now rivaled the dying Louis XV as the talk of Paris. His
burly</p>
<p>figure, his rubicund face and massive nose were pointed out wherever
he went, and his imperious temper became the subject of a hundred
anecdotes. Greuze painted his portrait, showing the jovial good nature
behind the lines of strife and strain. He ate like Dr. Johnson, and
drank only less than Bos- well. He made no pretense about scorning
money, and joined readily in appreciation of his work. He treated
courtiers and commoners alike — as inferiors; he expected noble lords to
hand him his wig, his coat, his cane; and when a prince was introduced
to him, and Gluck kept his seat, he explained, “The custom in Germany is
to rise only for people one respects.” 14</p>
<p>The director of the Opera had warned him that if Iphigenie en Aulide
was accepted, Gluck would have to write five more operas in quick order,
since Iphigenie would drive all other operas from the stage. This did
not frighten Gluck, who had a way of conscripting parts of his older
composi- tions to squeeze them into new ones. He had Orfeo ed Euridice
translated into French; and since no good contralto was available, he
rewrote the part of Orpheus for the tenor Legros. Sophie Arnould, become
tractable, played Eurydice. The Paris premiere was a heartening success.
Marie Antoinette, now Queen of France, awarded a pension of six thousand
francs to u mon cher Gluck.” 15 He returned to Vienna with his head in
the stars.</p>
<p>In March, 1776, he was back in Paris with a French version of Alceste
, which was produced to mild applause on April 23. Gluck, inured to
success, reacted to this setback with angry pride: “ Alceste is not the
kind of work to give momentary pleasure, or to please because it is new.
Time does not exist for it; and I claim that it will give equal pleasure
two hundred years hence if the French la nguage does not change.” 16 In
June he retreated to Vienna, and soon thereafter he began to put to
music Marmontel’s revision of Qui - nault’s libretto Roland.</p>
<p>Now began the most famous contest in operatic history. For meanwhile
the management of the Opera had commissioned Niccolo Piccini of Naples
to set to music the same libretto, and to come to Paris and produce it.
He came (December 31, 1776). Informed of this commission, Gluck sent to
Du Rollet (now in Paris) a letter of Olympian wrath:</p>
<p>I have just received your letter… exhorting me to continue my work on
the words of the opera Roland. This is no longer feasible, for when I
heard that the management of the Opera, not unaware that I was doing
Roland , had given the same work to M. Piccini to do, I burned as much
of it as I had already done, which perhaps was not worth much…. I am no
longer the man to enter into competition, and M. Piccini would have too
great an advantage over me, since — his personal merit apart, which is
assuredly very great — he would</p>
<p>37 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>have that of novelty…. I am sure that a certain politician of my
acquaintance will offer dinner and supper to three quarters of Paris in
order to win him proselytes. 17</p>
<p>For reasons not now clear this letter, obviously private, was
published in the Annee litter air e for February, 1777. It became,
unintentionally, a declara- tion of war.</p>
<p>Gluck reached Paris May 29 with a new opera, Armide. The rival com-
posers met at a dinner; they embraced, and conversed amicably. Piccini
had come to France with no notion that he was to be a pawn in a mess of
partisan intrigue and operatic salesmanship; he himself warmly admired
Gluck’s work. Despite the friendliness of the protagonists the war went
on in salons and cafes, in streets and homes; “no door was opened to a
visitor,” reported Charles Burney, “without the question being asked,
previous to admission, ‘ Monsieur , estes vous Picciniste ou Gluckiste”
18 Marmontel, d’Alembert, and Laharpe led in acclaiming Piccini and the
Italian style; the Abbe Arnaud defended Gluck in a Profession de foi en
musique; Rousseau, who had begun the war with his pro-Italian Lettre sur
la musique frangaise (1753), sup- ported Gluck.</p>
<p>Armide was produced on September 23, 1777. Subject and music were
reversions to modes established before Gluck’s reform; the story was
from Tasso, exalting the Christian Rinaldo and the pagan Armida; the
music was Lully restored with romantic tenderness; the ballet was
Noverre in excelsis. The audience liked the mixture; it gave the opera a
good reception; but the Piccinistes condemned Armide as a refurbishing
of Lully and Rameau. They waited anxiously for their standard- bearer’s
Roland. Piccini dedicated it to Marie Antoinette with apologies:
“Transplanted, isolated, in a country where all was new to me,
intimidated in my work by a thousand difficulties, I needed all my
courage, and my courage forsook me.” 19 At times he was on the verge of
abandoning the contest and returning to Italy. He persevered, and had
the comfort of a successful premiere (January 27, 1778). The two
victories seemed to cancel each other, and the public war went on. Mme.
Vigee- Lebrun saw it at first hand. “The usual battlefield was the
garden of the Palais-Royal. There the partisans of Gluck and Piccini
quarreled so violently that many a duel resulted.” 20</p>
<p>Gluck returned to Vienna in March, stopping at Ferney to see
Voltaire. He took home with him two librettos: one by Nicolas-Frangois
Guillard based on the Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides, the other by
Baron Jean- Baptiste de Tschoudi on the Echo and Narcissus theme. He
worked on both books, and by the fall of 1778 he felt ready for another
battle. So in Novem- ber we find him in Paris again; and on May 18,
1779, he presented at the Opera what most students consider his greatest
composition, Iphigenie en T auride. It is a somber story, and much of
the music is monotonously plain- tive; at times we tire of Iphigenia’s
high -keyed laments. But when the per- formance is over, and the
incantation of the music and the lines has stilled our skeptic reason,
we realize that we have experienced a profound and powerful drama. A
contemporary remarked that there were many fine pas-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>sages in it. “There is only one,” said Abbe Arnaud, “—the entire
work.” 21 The first night’s audience gave the piece a wild ovation.</p>
<p>Gluck challenged the gods by hurrying to offer his other piece, Echo
et Narcisse (September 21, 1779). It failed, and the maestro left Paris
in a huff (October), declaring that he had had enough of France, and
would write no more operas. If he had remained he could have heard
another Iphigenie en T amide, produced by Piccini after two years of
labor. The premiere (January 23, 1781) was well received, but on the
second night Mile. La- guerre, who sang the title role, was so obviously
drunk that Sophie Arnould destroyed the performance by calling it
Iphigenie en Champagne. 22 This contretemps ended the operatic war;
Piccini handsomely admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Gluck, in Vienna, dreamed of other victories. On February 10, 1780,
he wrote to Goethe’s Duke Karl August of Saxe - Weimar: “I have grown
very old, and have squandered the best powers of my mind upon the French
na- tion; nevertheless I feel an inward impulse to write something for
my own country.” 23 Now he put some odes of Klopstock to music that
prepared for the finest lieder. In April, 1781, he suffered a stroke,
but he was comforted by Vienna’s reception of Iphigenie in Tanris and
the revival of Orfeo and Alceste. On November 15, 1787, while
entertaining friends, he drank at one gulp a glass of strong liquor,
which had been forbidden him. He fell into convulsions, and died within
four hours. Piccini, in Naples, tried in vain to raise funds for annual
concerts in his rival’s memory. 24 Italy, pursuing melody, ignored
Gluck’s reforms; Mozart followed the Italians, and must have been
shocked at the idea of making music the servant of poetry. But Herder,
com- ing at the end of this creative era, and looking back upon it with
limited knowledge of Bach, Haydn, and Mozart, called Gluck the greatest
com- poser of the century. 25</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>JOSEPH HAYDN: 1732-1809</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easier to love Haydn, for here was a man who quarreled with no
one but his wife, hailed his competitors as his friends, suffused his
music with gaiety, and was constitutionally incapable of tragedy.</p>
<p>He had no advantages of birth. His father was a wagonmaker and house
painter at Rohrau, a little town on the Austro-Hungarian frontier. His
mother had been cook for the counts of Harrach. Both parents were of
Slavic- Croatian, not German, stock, and many of Haydn’s melodies echo
Croatian</p>
<p>Aged six, he was sent to live with a relative, Johann Matthias
Franck, who kept a school in Hainburg. There his day began with classes
from seven to ten, then Mass, then home for dinner, then classes from
twelve to three, then instruction in music. He was trained to piety, and
never lost it. His mother longed to make him a priest, and she was
deeply grieved when he chose the</p>

<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>hazardous life of a musician. Franck encouraged the boy’s
predilection for music, taught him all that was in his own range, and
held him to a severe regimen of study. In old age Haydn recalled and
forgave: “I shall be grateful to that man as long as I live for keeping
me so hard at work, though I used to get more floggings than food.” 26
After two years with Franck, Joseph was taken to Vienna by Georg
Reutter, Kapellmeister at St. Stephen’s; Reutter thought his “weak,
sweet voice” could find some modest place in a choir. So, at the age of
eight, the timid-eager lad went to live in the Kantorei, or Singers’
School, adjoining the stately cathedral. There he received lessons in
arithmetic, writing, Latin, religion, singing, and violin. He sang in
the cathedral and in the Imperial Chapel, but he was so poorly fed that
he wel- comed calls to sing in private homes, where he could fill his
stomach besides singing his songs.</p>
<p>In 1745 his brother Michael, five years his junior, joined him in the
Kan- torei. About this time Joseph’s voice began to break; He was
invited to keep his soprano by having himself castrated, but his parents
refused consent. Reutter kept him as long as possible; then, in 1748,
Joseph, now sixteen, found himself free and penniless, and with no grace
of person to win fortune’s smile. His face was pitted with smallpox, his
nose was outstanding, his legs were too short for his body, his dress
was shabby, his gait awkward, his manner shy. He was not yet skilled in
any instrument, but he was already turning over compositions in his
head.</p>
<p>A fellow chorister offered him an attic room, and Anton Buchholz lent
him 150 florins, which honest Haydn later repaid. He had to fetch water
up to his garret every day, but he secured an old clavier, took pupils,
and sur- vived. On most days he worked sixteen hours, sometimes more. He
played the violin in a church; he played the organ in the private chapel
of Count Haugwitz, minister to Maria Theresa; he sang tenor, now and
then, in St. Stephen’s. The famous Metastasio had an apartment in the
same building; he secured Haydn as music teacher for the daughter of a
friend; through Metastasio Haydn met Porpora; Haydn agreed to serve this
prince of singing masters in any capacity, in return for instruction in
composition. He received the precious lessons, cleaned the maestro’s
shoes, coat, and wig, and provided clavier accompaniment for Porpora and
pupils. Said Haydn in retrospect: “Young people can learn from my
example that something can come out of nothing. What I am is all the
result of the direst need.” 27</p>
<p>Through his new friends he became acquainted with Gluck and Ditters-
dorf, and several members of the nobility. Karl Joseph von Fiirnberg
took him (1755) for a long stay at his country house, Weinzierl, near
Melk; there Haydn found an orchestra of eight pieces, and some leisure
to compose. Now he wrote his first quartets. To the sonata structure of
three movements, which he adopted from Karl Philipp Emanuel Bach, he
added a minuet, scored the four movements for four pieces, and gave the
instrumental quartet its modern form. He returned to Vienna in 1756,
attracted distinguished pupils like the Countess von Thun, and (1759)
accepted the post of Musik- direktor for Count Maximilian von Morzin,
whose private orchestra of</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>welve to sixteen pieces played at Vienna in winter and, in summer, in
the Count’s villa at Lukavec in Bohemia. For this ensemble Haydn wrote
his first symphony (1759).</p>
<p>As he was now earning two hundred florins per year, with board and
lodging, he thought he could risk the gamble of marriage. Among his
pupils were two daughters of a wigmaker; he fell in love with the
younger one, but she became a nun, and the father prevailed upon Haydn
to marry the sister, Maria Anna (1760). She was thirty-one, he
twenty-eight. She proved to be quarrelsome, bigoted, wasteful and
barren. “She doesn’t care a straw,” said Haydn, “whether her husband is
an artist or a cobbler.” 28 He began to look at other women.</p>
<p>The audience in Morzin’s home occasio nally included Prince Pal Anton
Esterhazy. When Morzin disbanded his orchestra the Prince engaged Haydn
(1761) as assistant music director for his country seat at Eisenstadt in
Hun- gary. The contract called for four hundred florins per year with a
seat at the officers’ table; and “it is especially observed that when
the orchestra shall be summoned to perform before company, the…
musicians shall appear in uniform,… in white stockings, white linen,
and… a queue or a</p>
<p>iewig.” 29 At Eisenstad t the Kapellmeister , Gregor Werner, busied
himself with church music; Haydn prepared concerts and composed music
for them. He had under him fourteen musicians, seven singers, and a
chorus chosen from the servants of the Prince. The small size of the
orchestra, and the character of the audience, shared in determining the
light and amiable qual- ity of the music written by Haydn for the
Esterhazy family. His genial spirit made him popular with the musicians;
they called him “Papa Haydn” soon after his coming to Eisenstadt, though
he was then only twenty-nine. 30 For them he composed sonatas, trios,
quartets, concertos, songs, cantatas, and some thirty symphonies. Many
of these compositions, though by contract they belonged to the Prince,
were published or circulated in manuscript, in Vienna, Leipzig,
Amsterdam, Paris, and London, and gave Haydn, by 1766, an international
reputation.</p>
<p>When Pal Anton died (March 18, 1762) he was succeeded, as head of the
Esterhazy family, by his brother Miklos Jozsef, who loved music almost
as much as his diamond-studded uniform. He played well on the viola di
bor- done (a variant of the viola da gamba), and was a kindly master to
Haydn in the nearly thirty years of the ir association. Said Haydn: “My
Prince was always satisfied with my works. I not only had the
encouragement of con- stant approval, but as conductor of an orchestra I
could make experiments, observe what produced an effect and what
weakened it, and was thus in a position to improve, alter,… and be as
bold as I pleased. I was cut off from the world, there was no one to
confuse or torment me, and I was forced to become original.” 31</p>
<p>Werner died on March 5, 1766, and Haydn became Kapellmeister. Soon
afterward the household moved into the new palace — the Schloss
Esterhazy — which Miklos had built at the southern end of the Neusiedler
See in north- western Hungary. The Prince was so fond of this place that
he lived there</p>
<p>376</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>from early spring through autumn; in winter he removed, sometimes
with his musicians, to Vienna. The players and singers resented this
rural isolation, especially since they were separated, for three seasons
of the year, from their wives and children; but they were well paid, and
dared not complain. Once, to hint to Miklos that his musicians were
longing for a leave of absence, Haydn composed the Farewell Symphony
(No. 5), in which, toward the end, one instrument after another
disappeared from the score, the musician put out his candle, took up his
music and his instrument, and left the stage. The Prince saw the point,
and arranged for an early departure of the troupe to Vienna.</p>
<p>Haydn, by exception, was allowed to have his wife with him at
Esterhaza, but he did not appreciate the privilege. In 1779 he fell in
love with Luigia Polzelli, a mediocre singer who had been engaged for
Esterhaza along with her violinist husband Antonio. Haydn seems to have
felt that since the Cath- olic Church did not allow him to divorce his
troublesome wife, it should, in mercy, permit him a diversion or two;
and he made little effort to conceal his liaison. Antonio was too old
and ill to make effective protest, and knew that he was kept on the
rolls only because the Kapellmeister relished Luigia. She had come to
Esterhaza with a two-year-old son; in 1783 she bore another boy, whom
gossip credited to Papa Haydn; he took both the boys to his heart, and
helped them throughout his life.</p>
<p>During those busy years at Esterhaza Haydn, lacking outside stimulus
and competition, developed slowly as a composer. He produced nothing
memorable till he was thirty-two — an age at which Mozart had completed
his oeuvre except for The Magic Flute and the Requiem. Haydn’s finest
works came after he was fifty: his first major symphony when he was
nearly sixty, The Creation when he was sixty-six. He wrote several
operas for per- formance at Esterhaza, but when Prague invited him to
present an opera there, in a series that was to include The Marriage of
Figaro and Don Gio- vanni, he demurred in a letter of noble modesty
(December, 1787):</p>
<p>You desire an opera buff a from me…. If you intend to stage it at
Prague I cannot oblige you. My operas are inseparable from the company
for which I wrote them, and would never produce their calculated effect
apart from their native surroundings. It would be quite another matter
if I had the honor of be- ing commissioned to write a new opera for your
theater. Even then, however, it would be a risk to put myself in
competition with the great Mozart. If I could only inspire every lover
of music, especially among the great, with feelings as deep, and
comprehension as clear, as my own, in listening to the inimitable works
of Mozart, then surely the nations would contend for the possession of
such a jewel within their borders. Prague must strive to retain this
treasure within her grasp, but not without fitting reward. The want of
this often sad- dens the life of a great genius, and offers small
encouragement for further ef- forts and future times. I feel indignant
that Mozart has not yet been engaged at any imperial or royal court.
Pardon my wandering from the subject; Mozart is a man very dear to me.
32</p>
<p>Haydn himself was longing for some court where his talent might more
widely spread its wings, but he had to be content with royal
compliments.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>Gifts arrived from Ferdinand IV of Naples, Frederick William II of
Prussia, and the Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia. In 1781
Charles III of Spain sent him a golden snuffbox set with diamonds, and
the Spanish am- bassador at Vienna traveled to Esterhaza to present the
little treasure in per- son. Perhaps Boccherini, then settled in Madrid,
had a hand in this, for he so zealously adopted Haydn’s style that he
was nicknamed “Haydn’s wife.” 33 When the cathedral chapter at Cadiz
decided to commission a musical setting for the “Seven Last Words of Our
Saviour” it applied to Haydn, who re - sponded with an oratorio (1785)
that was soon performed in many lands — in the United States as early as
1791. In 1784 a Paris producer asked for six symphonies; Haydn obliged
with six Paris Symphonies. Several invitations came to him to conduct
concerts in London. Haydn felt bound to Esterhaza by loyalty as well as
contract, but his private letters revealed his increasing eagerness for
a larger stage.</p>
<p>On September 28, 1790, Prince Miklos Jozsef died. The new Prince,
Anton Esterhazy, cared little for music; he dismissed nearly all the
musicians, but kept Haydn nominally in his service, gave him a yearly
pension of fourteen hundred florins, and allowed him to live wherever he
pleased. Haydn almost precipitately moved to Vienna. Several proposals
were now made to him, most urgently from Johann Peter Salomon, who
announced, “I have come from London to fetch you; we shall conclude our
accord tomorrow.” He offered £ 300 for a new opera, £ 300 more for six
symphonies, £ 200 more for their copyright, £ 200 more for twenty
concerts in England, £200 more for a concert to be given there for H
aydn’s benefit— ,£ 1,200 in all. Haydn knew no English, and dreaded the
Channel crossing. Mozart begged him not to take on such labors and
risks: “Oh, Papa, you have had no education for the wide world, and you
speak so few languages!” Haydn answered, “ But my language is understood
all over the world.” 34 He sold the house Prince Miklos Jozsef had given
him in Eisenstadt, provided for his wife and his mistress, and set off
on the great adventure. He spent with Mozart the final days before
departure. Mozart wept to see him go; “I’m afraid, Papa, that this will
be our last farewell.”</p>
<p>Haydn and Salomon left Vienna December 1 5, 1790, and reached London
January 1, 1791. His first concert (March 11) was a triumph. The Morning
Chronicle ended its repor t by saying: “We cannot suppress our very
anxious hope that the first musical genius of the age may be induced by
our liberal welcome to take up his residence in England.” 35 All the
concerts went well, and on May 16 a benefit concert gladdened Haydn with
£ 350. In that month he attended the Handel Commemoration Concert in
Westminster Abbey and heard the Messiah ; he was so impressed that he
wept, saying, humbly, “Handel, the master of us all.” 38 Burney
suggested that Oxford give the new Handel an honorary degree; it was
offered; Haydn went up to the university in July, became a doctor of
music, and conducted there his Symphony in G Major (No. 92); he had
composed it three years before, but henceforth history knew it as the
Oxford Symphony. Its lovely slow movement recalls the old English ballad
“Lord Randall.”</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>Having had a view of the English countryside as a divine
transfiguration of seed and rain, Haydn, after returning to London,
gladly accepted invita- tions to country houses. There and in the city
he won many friends by his cheerful readiness to play and sing at
private gatherings. He took advanced pupils to teach them composition.
One of these was a comely and wealthy widow, Johanna Schroeter. Though
he was sixty the aura of his fame went to her head, and she tendered him
her love. He said later, “In all likelihood I should have married her if
I had been single.” 37 Meanwh ile his wife impor- tuned him to come
home. In a letter to Luigia Polzelli he grumbled: “My wife, that
infernal beast, wrote me so many things that I was forced to an- swer
that I was never coming back.” 38</p>
<p>Despite three women on his conscience and his purse, he worked hard
and now composed six (Nos. 93-98) of his twelve London Symphonies. They
show a remarkable development from his productions at Eisenstadt and
Esterhaza. Perhaps Mozart’s symphonies had stimulated him, or he had
been put on his mettle by the reception given him in England, or hearing
Handel had stirred in him depths untouched by his quiet environment in
the Hungarian hills, or his love affairs had moved him to tender
sentiments as well as simple joy. He found it difficult to leave
England, but he was under contract with Prince Anton Esterhazy, who now
insisted that Haydn return to share in the festivities prepared for the
coronation of the Emperor Francis II. So, toward the end of June, 1792,
he braved the Channel again, passed from Calais to Brussels to Bonn, met
Beethoven (then twenty-two), attended the coronation at Frankfurt, and
reached Vienna July 29.</p>
<p>No newspaper mentioned his return, no concerts were arranged for him,
the court ignored him. Mozart would have welcomed him, but Mozart was no
more. Haydn wrote to the widow, offered gratis lessons to Mozart’s son,
and urged publishers to print more of Mozart’s music. He went to live
with his wife in the house which is now preserved as a Haydn museum
(Haydn- gasse 19). The wife wished him to put the property in her name;
he refused. His quarrels with her were intensified. Beethoven came in
December, 1792, to study with him. The two geniuses did not harmonize:
Beethoven was proud and domineering; H aydn called him “that great
Mogul,” 39 and was too absorbed in his own work to correct his pupil’s
exercises conscien - tiously. Beethoven secretly found another teacher,
but continued to take les- sons from Haydn. “I have learned nothing from
him,” said the young Ti- tan; 40 however, many of his early pieces
follow Haydn’s style, and some were dedicated to the old master.</p>
<p>Appreciation of Haydn grew in Austria, and at Rohrau, in 1792, Count
von Harrach set up a monument to the town’s now famous son. But the
memory of triumphs and friendships in England was still warm, and when
Salomon offered him a second engagement in London, with a commission to
write six new symphonies, the composer readily agreed. He left Vienna on
January 19, 1794, and reached London on February 4. This stay of
eighteen months in England was as heartening a success as the first. The
second set of London Symphonies (Nos. 99-104) was well received, a
benefit concert</p>

<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>netted Haydn ^400, pupils paid him a guinea per lesson, and
Mrs. Schroeter lived nearby. He was again a favorite with the
aristocracy; both the King and the King’s enemy, the Prince of Wales,
received him; the Queen offered him a residence at Windsor for the
summer if he would remain in England for another season. He excused
himself on the ground that the new Prince Esterhazy was summoning him,
and he could not so long absent himself from his wife (!). Prince Anton
had died; his successor, Prince Miklos II, wished to restore orchestral
performances at Eisenstadt. So, his trunks packed and his pockets full,
Haydn left London August 15, 1795, and made his way home.</p>
<p>After a visit to his own statue at Rohrau, he reported to Miklos II
at Eisen- stadt, and organized music for various occasions there. Except
for summer and autumn, however, he lived in his own house on the
outskirts of Vienna. In the years 1796-97 Napoleon was driving the
Austrians before him in Italy, and the rise of revolutionary sentiment
in Austria threatened the Haps- burg monarchy. Haydn recalled how the
emotion aroused by the singing of “God Save the King” had strengthened
the Hanoverian dynast y in Eng- land; might not a national anthem do
likewise for Emperor Francis IIP His friend Baron Gottfried van Swieten
(son of Maria Theresa’s physician) suggested this to Count von Saurau,
minister of the interior; Saurau ap- pointed Leopold Haschka t o compose
a text; the poet responded with “ Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser, unsern
guten Kaiser Franz!” Haydn adapted to these words the tune of an old
Croat song, and the result was a simple but stirring anthem. It was
first publicly sung on the Emperor ’s birthday, Febru - ary 12, 1797, in
all the principal theaters of the Austro-Hungarian realm. It continued,
with some change of words, to be the Austrian national hymn until 1938.
Haydn developed the melody, with variations, into the second movement of
his string quartet Opus 76, No. 3.</p>
<p>Still under the spell of Handel, Haydn tried next to rival the
Messiah. Salomon had offered him a libretto compiled from Milton’s
Paradise Lost; van Swieten translated the libretto into German, and
Haydn composed his massive oratorio Die Schopfimg. The Creation was
performed before an in- vited audience in the palace of Prince von
Schwarzenberg April 29-30, 1798. So great a crowd gathered outside the
palace that fifty mounted police (we are assured) were needed to keep
order. 41 The Prince financed a public per- formance in the National
Theater March 1 9, 1 799, and gave all the proceeds (four thousand
florins) to the composer. The auditors greeted the music with almost
religious fervor; soon the oratorio was heard in almost every major city
in Christendom. The Catholic Church condemned the composi- tion as too
lighthearted for so august a theme, and Schiller agreed with Bee- thoven
in ridiculing Haydn’s mimicry of Eden’s animals; but Goethe ac - claimed
the work, and in Prussia it was more frequently performed in the
nineteenth century than any other choral composition.</p>
<p>Van Swieten offered another libretto, adapted from James Thomson’s
The Seasons. Haydn labored over it for nearly two years (1799-1801), at
much cost to his health; The Seasons, he said, “has broken my back.” The
premiere</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>(April 24, 1801) was well received, but the piece aroused no wide or
lasting enthusiasm. After conducting The Seven Last Words of Christ for
a hospital benefit, Haydn retired from active life.</p>
<p>His wife had died on March 20, 1800, but he was now too old to enjoy
his freedom, though not too old to enjoy his fame. He was recognized as
the dean of composers; a dozen cities voted him honors; famous musicians
— Cherubini, the Webers, Ignaz Pleyel, Hummel — came to pay him homage.
Nevertheless rheumatism, dizziness, and other ailments left him
melancholy, irritable, and fearfully pious. Camille Pleyel, visiting him
in 1 805, found him “holding a rosary in his hands, and I believe he
passes almost the whole day in prayer. He says always that his end is
near…. We did not stay long, for we saw that he wished to pray.” 42 In
that year a false report spread that Haydn had died. Cherubini wrote a
cantata on his death, and Paris planned a memorial concert with Mozart’s
Requiem; then word came that the old</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>: An was still alive. When Haydn heard of this he remarked, “I would
have traveled to Paris to conduct the Requiem myself.” 43</li>
</ol>
<p>He made his last public appearance on March 27, 1809, when The Crea-
tion was sung at the University of Vienna to celebrate his approaching
sev- enty-sixth birthday. Prince Esterhazy sent his carriage to take the
invalid to the concert; Haydn was borne in an armchair into the hall
amid an audience of nobles and celebrities; princesses wrapped their
shawls around his shiver- ing body; Beethoven knelt and kissed his hand.
Emotion overcame the old composer; he had to be taken home in the
intermission.</p>
<p>On May 12, 1809, Napoleon’s artillery began to bombard Vienna. A</p>
<p>cannonball fell near Haydn’s house, shaking it and the inmates, but
Haydn assured them, “Children, don’t be frightened; where Haydn is no
harm can come to you.” It proved true except for himself; the
bombardment shat - tered his nervous system. When the French took the
city Napoleon ordered a guard of honor to be placed before the
composer’s home. A French officer, entering, sang an aria from The
Creation in “so manly and sublime a style” that Haydn embraced him. On
May 3 1 he died, aged seventy-seven. All the major cities of Europe held
services in his memory.</p>
<p>Haydn’s historic achievement was in the development of musical forms.
He gave the orchestra a new vitality by balancing the strings with wind
and percussion instruments. Building upon the work of Sammartini,
Stamitz, and Karl Philipp Emanuel Bach, he established the structure of
the sonata as the exposition, elaboration, and recapitulation of
contrasted themes. He pre- pared the divertimento for Mozart as less
formal than the suite, and better adapted for social gatherings. He gave
the string quartet its classic configura- tion by extending it to four
movements, and by giving the first movement “sonata form.” Here his
successors had to use the same number and quality of instruments that
Haydn had employed, and he achieved in several in- stances a cheerful
and tender loveliness to which some of us return with relief from the
laborious involutions of Beethoven’s later quartets.</p>
<p>Nine or ten of the 104 Haydn symphonies still live. The names they
bear were not his choice, but were applied by commentators or editors.
We have</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>MUSIC REFORMED</p>
<p>3 8l</p>
<p>noted elsewhere the evolution of the sinfonia (i.e., assembled
sounds) from the overture through the experiments of Sammartini and
Stamitz; many others preceded Haydn in molding the structure of the
“classic” symphony; and when he emerged from Esterhaza into a wider
world he was not too old to learn from Mozart how to fill out the
structure with significance and feel- ing. The Oxford Symphony marks his
rise to greater amplitude and power, and the London Symphonies show him
in his fullest symphonic reach. No. 101 (the Clock Symphony) is
delightful, and No. 104 is quite up to Mozart.</p>
<p>Generally we perceive in his music a kindly, gracious nature which
may never have felt the depths of grief or love, and which had been
compelled to produce too rapidly to permit the maturing of concept,
theme, or phrase. Haydn was too happy to be profoundly great, and spoke
too often to say much. And yet there is a treasure of pure and placid
delight in these playful scores; here, as he put it, “the weary and
worn, or the man burdened with affairs, may enjoy some solace and
refreshment.” 44</p>
<p>Haydn fell out of fashion soon after his death. His works reflected a
stable feudal world, and an environment of aristocratic security and
ease; they were too gay and self-content to satisfy a century of
revolutions, crises, and romantic ecstasies and despair. He came back
into favor when Brahms praised him and Debussy wrote Homage a Haydn
(1909). Men then realized that though the Raphael and the Michelangelo
of music who followed him poured deeper thought with subtler mastery
into their compositions, they were able to do this because Haydn and his
predecessors had molded the forms to receive their gold. “I know that
God has bestowed a talent upon me,” Haydn said, “and I thank Him for it.
I think I have done my duty, and been of use;… let others do the same.”
