<p>Indian Art</p>
<p>I. THE MINOR ARTS</p>
<p>The great age of Indian art — Its uniqueness — Its association
with</p>
<p>industry — Pottery — Metal — Wood — Ivory — Jewelry —</p>
<p>Textiles</p>
<p>B EFORE Indian art, as before every phase of Indian civilization,
we</p>
<p>stand in humble wonder at its age and its continuity. The ruins
of</p>
<p>Mohenjo-daro are not all utilitarian; among them are limestone
bearded men (significantly like Sumerians), terra-cotta figures of women
and animals, beads and other ornaments of carnelian, and jewelry of
finely polished gold . 1 One seal 2 shows in bas-relief a bull so
vigorously and in- cisively drawn that the observer almost leaps to the
conclusion that art does not progress, but only changes its form.</p>
<p>From that time to this, through the vicissitudes of five thousand
years, India has been creating its peculiar type of beauty in a hundred
arts. The record is broken and incomplete, not because India ever
rested, but be- cause war and the idol-smashing ecstasies of Moslems
destroyed uncounted masterpieces of building and’statuary, and poverty
neglected the preserva- tion of others. We shall find it difficult to
enjoy this art at first sight; its music will seem weird, its painting
obscure, its architecture confused, its sculpture grotesque. We shall
have to remind ourselves at every step that our tastes are the fallible
product of our local and limited traditions and environments; and that
we do ourselves and foreign nations injustice when we judge them, or
their arts, by standards and purposes natural to our life and alien to
their own.</p>
<p>In India the artist had not yet been separated from the artisan,
making art artificial and work a drudgery; as in our Middle Ages, so, in
the India that died at Plassey, every mature workman was a craftsman,
giving form and personality to the product of his skill and taste. Even
today, when</p>
<p>584</p>
<p>INDIAN ART</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>585</p>
<p>factories replace handicrafts, and craftsmen degenerate into “hands,”
the stalls and shops of every Hindu town show squatting artisans beating
metal, moulding jewelry, drawing designs, weaving delicate shawls and
embroideries, or carving ivory and wood. Probably no other nation</p>
<p>known to us has ever had so exuberant a variety of arts . 5</p>
<p>Strange to say, pottery failed to rise from an industry to an art in
India; caste rules put so many limitations upon the repeated use of the
same dish # that there was small incentive to adorn with beauty the
frail and transient earthenware that came so rapidly from the potter’s
hand . 4 If the vessel was to be made of some precious metal, then
artistry could spend itself upon it without stint; witness the Tan j ore
silver vase in the Victoria Institute at Madras, or the gold Betel Dish
of Kandy . 5 Brass was hammered into an endless variety of lamps, bowls
and containers; a black alloy ( bidri ) of zinc was often used for
boxes, basins and trays; and one metal was inlaid or overlaid upon
another, or encrusted with silver or gold . 5 Wood was carved with a
profusion of plant and animal forms. Ivory was cut into everything from
deities to dice; doors and other objects of wood were inlaid with it;
and dainty receptacles were made of it for cosmetics and perfumes. Jew-
elry abounded, and was worn by rich and poor as ornament or hoard;
Jaipur excelled in firing enamel colors upon a gold background; clasps,
beads, pendants, knives and combs were moulded into tasteful shapes,
with floral, animal, or theological, designs; one Brahman pendant
harbors in its tiny space half a hundred gods . 1 Textiles were woven
with an artistry never since excelled; from the days of Caesar to our
own the fabrics of India have been prized by all the world, f Sometimes,
by the subtlest and most painstaking of precalculated measurements,
every thread of warp and woof was dyed before being placed upon the
loom; the design ap- peared as the weaving progressed, and was identical
on either side . 5 From homespun khaddar to complex brocades flaming
with gold, from pictur- esque pyjamas | to the invisibly-seamed shawls
of Kashmir, § every gar- ment woven in India has a beauty that comes
only of a very ancient, and now almost instinctive, art.</p>
<ul>

<p>t Perhaps the oldest printing of textiles from blocks was done in
India, 8 though it never grew there into the kindred art of
block-printing books.</p>

joined into what seems to be a single fabric.“</p>

<li>MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>A concert in India — Music and the dance — Musicians — Scale and</p>
<p>forms — Themes — Music and philosophy</p>
<p>An American traveler, permitted to intrude upon a concert in Madras,
found an audience of some two hundred Hindus, apparently all Brahmans,
seated some on benches, some on a carpeted floor, listening intently to
a small ensemble beside which our orchestral mobs would have seemed
designed to make themselves heard on the moon. The instruments were
unfamiliar to the visitor, and to his provincial eye they looked like
the strange and abnormal products of some neglected garden. There were
drums of many shapes and sizes, ornate flutes and serpentine horns, and
a variety of strings. Most of these pieces were wrought with minute
work- manship, and some were studded with gems. One drum, the mridanga,
was formed like a small barrel; both ends were covered with a parchment
whose pitch was changed by tightening or loosening it with little
leather thongs; one parchment head had been treated with manganese dust,
boiled rice and tamarind juice in order to elicit from it a peculiar
tone. The</p>
<p>drummer used only his hands — sometimes the palm, sometimes the
fingers, sometimes the merest finger-tips. Another player had a tambura,
or lute, whose four long strings were sounded continuously as a deep and
quiet background for the melody. One instrument, the vina, was
especially sensitive and eloquent; its strings, stretched over a slender
metal plate from a parchment-covered drum of wood at one end to a
resounding hollow gourd at the other, were kept vibrating with a
plectrum, while the player’s left hand etched in the melody with fingers
moving deftly from string to string. The visitor listened humbly, and
understood nothing.</p>
<p>Music in India has a history of at least three thousand years. The
Vedic hymns, like all Hindu poetry, were written to be sung; poetry and
song, music and dance, were made one art in the ancient ritual. The
Hindu dance, which, to the beam in the Occidental eye, seems as
voluptuous and obscene as Western dancing seems to Hindus, has been,
through the greater part of Indian history, a form of religious worship,
a display of beauty in motion and rhythm for the honor and edification
of the gods; only in modern times have the devadasis emerged from the
temples in great number to entertain the secular and profane. To the
Hindu these dances</p>
<p>INDIAN ART</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>were no mere display of flesh; they were, in one aspect, an imitation
of the rhythms and processes of the universe. Shiva himself was the god
of the dance, and the dance of Shiva symbolized the very movement of the
world.*</p>
<p>Musicians, singers and dancers, like all artists in India, belonged
to the lowest castes. The Brahman might like to sing in private, and
accompany himself on a vina or another stringed instrument; he might
teach others to play, or sing, or dance; but he would never think of
playing for hire, or of putting an instrument to his mouth. Public
concerts were, until recently, a rarity in India; secular music was
either the spontaneous singing or thrumming of the people, or it was
performed, like the chamber music of Europe, before small gatherings in
aristocratic homes. Akbar, himself skilled in music, had many musicians
at his court; one of his singers, Tansen, became popular and wealthy,
and died of drink at the age of thirty-four . 11 There were no amateurs,
there were only professionals; music was not taught as a social
accomplishment, and children were not beaten into Beethovens. The
function of the public was not to play poorly, but to listen well .
13</p>
<p>For listening to music, in India, is itself an art, and requires long
training of ear and soul. The words may be no more intelligible to the
Westerner than the words of the operas which he feels it his class duty
to enjoy; they range, as everywhere, about the two subjects of religion
and love; but the words are of little moment in Hindu music, and the
singer, as in our most advanced literature, often replaces them with
meaningless syllables. The music is written in scales more subtle and
minute than ours. To our scale of twelve tones it adds ten “microtones,”
making a scale of twenty -two quarter-tones in all. Hindu music may be
written in a notation composed of Sanskrit letters; usually it is
neither written nor read, but is passed down “by ear” from generation to
generation, or from composer to learner. I t is not separated into bars,
but glides in a continuous legato which frustrates a listener accustomed
to regular emphases or beats. It has no chords, and does not deal in
harmony; it confines itself to melody, with perhaps a back- ground of
undertones; in this sense it is much simpler and more primitive</p>
<ul>
<li>The secular Hindu dance has been revealed to Europe and America by
the not quite orthodox art of Shankar, in which every movement of the
body, the hands, the fingers and the eyes conveys a subtle and precise
significance to the initiated spectator, and carries an undulating
grace, and a precise and corporeal poetry, unknown in the West- ern
dance since our democratic return to the African in art.</li>
</ul>
<p>588 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>than European music, while it is more complex in scale and rhythm.
The melodies are both limited and infinite: they must all derive from
one or an- other of the thirty-six traditional modes or airs, but they
may weave upon these themes an endless and seamless web of variation.
Each of these themes, or ragas* consists of five, six or seven notes, to
one of which the musician constantly returns. Each raga is named from
the mood that it wishes to sug- gest — “Dawn,” “Spring,” “Evening
Beauty,” “Intoxication,” etc. — and is as- sociated with a specific time
of the day or the year. Hindu legend ascribes an occult power to these
ragas; so it is said that a Bengal dancing-girl ended a drought by
singing, as a kind of “Rain - drop Prelude,” the Megh mallar raga, or
rain-making theme . 13 Their antiquity has given the ragas a sacred
character; he who plays them must observe them faithfully, as forms
enacted by Shiva himself. One player, Narada, having performed them
carelessly, was ushered into hell by Vishnu, and was shown men and women
weeping over their broken limbs; these, said the god, were the ragas and
raginis dis- torted and torn by Narada’s reckless playing. Seeing which,
we are told, Narada sought more humbly a greater perfection in his art .
14</p>
<p>The Indian performer is not seriously hampered by the obligation to
remain faithful to the raga that he has chosen for his program, any more
than the Western composer of sonatas or symphonies is hampered by
adhering to his theme; in either case what is lost in liberty is gained
in access to coherence of structure and symmetry of form. The Hindu</p>
<p>musician is like the Hindu philosopher; he starts with the finite and
“sends his soul into the infinite”; he embroiders upon his theme until,
through an undulating stream of rhythm and recurrence, even through a
hypnotizing monotony of notes, he has created a kind of musical Yoga, a
forgetfulness of will and individuality, of matter, space and time; the
soul is lifted into an almost mystic union with something “deeply
interfused,” some pro - found, immense and quiet Being, some primordial
and pervasive reality that smiles upon all striving wills, all change
and death.</p>
<p>Probably we shall never care for Hindu music, and never comprehend
it, until we have abandoned striving for being, progress for permanence,
desire for acceptance, and motion for rest. This may come when Europe
again is subject, and Asia again is master. But then Asia will have
tired of being, permanence, acceptance and rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>More strictly speaking there are six ragas, or basic themes, each
with five modifica- tions called ragini. Raga means color, passion,
mood; ragini is its feminine form.</li>

<li>PAINTING</li>

<p>Prehistoric — The frescoes of Ajanta — Rajput miniatures — The</p>
<p>Mogul school — The painters — The theorists</p>
<p>A provincial is a man who judges the world in terms of his parish,
and considers all unfamiliar things barbarous. It is told of the Emperor
Je- hangir — a man of taste and learning in the arts — that when he was
shown a European painting he rejected it summarily; being “in oyle, he
liked it not.” 15</p>
<p>It is clear, from the drawings, in red pigment, of animals and a
rhinoceros hunt in the prehistoric caves of Singanpur and Mirzapur, that
Indian paint- ing has had a history of many thousands of years. Palettes
with ground colors ready for use abound among the remains of neolithic
India. 16 Great gaps occur in the history of the art, because most of
the early work was ruined by the climate, and much of the remainder was
destroyed by Moslem “idol - breakers” from Mahmud to Aurangzeb. 17 The
Vinaya Pitaka (ca. 300 b.c.) refers to King Pasenada’s palace as
containing picture galleries, and Fa-Hien and Yuan Chwang describe many
buildings as famous for the ex- cellence of their murals; 18 but no
trace of these structures remains. One of the oldest frescoes in Tibet
shows an artist painting a portrait of Buddha; 19 the later artist took
it for granted that painting was an established art in Buddha’s The
earliest dateable Indian painting is a group of Buddhist frescoes (ca.
100 b . c .) found on the walls of a cave in Sirguya, in the Central
Provinces. From that time on the art of fresco painting — that is,
painting upon freshly laid plaster before it dries — progressed step by
step until on the walls of the caves at Ajanta* it reached a perfection
never excelled even by Giotto or Leonardo. These temples were carved out
of the rocky face of a mountain-side at various periods from the first
to the seventh century a.d. For centuries they were lost to history and
human memory after the decay of Buddhism; the jungle grew about them and
almost buried them; bats, snakes and other beasts made their home there,
and a thousand varieties of birds and insects fouled the paintings with
their waste. In 1819 Europeans stumbled into the ruins, and were amazed
to find on the walls frescoes that are now ranked among the masterpieces
of the world’s art. 20</p>
<p>The temples have been called caves, for in most cases they are cut
into the mountains. Cave No. XVI, for example, is an excavation
sixty-five feet</p>
<ul>
<li>Near the village of Fardapur, in the native state of Hyderabad.</li>
</ul>

<p>each way, upheld by twenty pillars; alongside the central hall are
sixteen monastic cells; a porticoed veranda adorns the front, and a
sanctuary hides in the back. Every wall is covered with frescoes. In
1879 sixteen of the</p>
<p>twenty-nine temples contained paintings; by 1910 the frescoes in ten
of these sixteen had been destroyed by exposure, and those in the
remaining six had been mutilated by inept attempts at restoration. 21
Once these frescoes were brilliant with red, green, blue and purple
pigments; nothing survives of the colors now except low-toned and
blackened surfaces. Some of the paintings, thus obscured by time and
ignorance, seem coarse and grotesque to us, who cannot read the Buddhist
legends with Buddhist hearts; others are at once powerful and graceful,
a revelation of the skill of craftsmen whose names perished long before
their work.</p>
<p>Despite these depredations, Cave I is still rich in masterpieces.
Here, on one wall, is (probably) a Bodhisattwa — a Buddhist saint
entitled to Nirvana , but choosing, instead, repeated rebirths in order
to minister to men. Never has the sadness of understanding been more
profoundly portrayed; 22 one wonders which is finer or deeper — this, or
Leonardo’s kindred study of the head of Christ.* On another wall of the
same temple is a study of Shiva and his wife Parvati, dressed in
jewelry. 23 Nearby is a painting of four deer, tender with the Buddhist
sympathy for animals; and on the ceiling is a de- sign still alive with
delicately drawn flowers and fowl. 24 On a wall of Cave XVII is a
graceful representation, now half destroyed, of the god Vishnu, with his
retinue, flying down from heaven to attend some event in the life of
Buddha; 25 on another wall is a schematic but colorful portrait of a
prin- cess and her maids. 28 Mingled with these chef -d* oeuvres are
crowded fres- coes of apparently poor workmanship, describing the youth,
flight and temptation of Buddha. 27</p>
<p>But we cannot judge these works in their original form from what sur-
vives of them today; and doubtless there are clues to their appreciation
that are not revealed to alien souls. Even the Occidental, however, can
admire the nobility of the subject, the majestic scope of the plan, the
unity of the composition, the clearness, simplicity and decisiveness of
the line, and — among many details — the astonishing perfection of that
bane of all artists, the hands. Imagination can picture the
artist-priestsf who prayed in these cells and perhaps painted these
walls and ceilings with fond and pious art while Europe lay buried in
her early-medieval darkness. Here at Ajanta re- ligious devotion fused
architecture, sculpture and painting into a happy unity, and produced
one of the sovereign monuments of Hindu art.</p>

<p>INDIAN ART</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>591</p>
<p>When their temples were closed or destroyed by Huns and Moslems the
Hindus turned their pictorial skill to lesser forms. Among the Rajputs a
school of painters arose who recorded in delicate miniatures the
episodes of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana , and the heroic deeds of
the Rajputana chieftains; often they were mere outlines, but always they
were instinct with life, and perfect in design. There is, in the Museum
of Fine Arts at Boston, a charming example of this style, symbolizing
one of the ragas of music by means of graceful women, a stately tower,
and a lowering sky. 29 Another example, in the Art Institute of Detroit,
represents with unique delicacy a scene from the Gita-GovindaJ 30 The
human figures in these and other Hindu paintings were rarely drawn from
models; the artist visualized them out of imagination and memory. He
painted, usually, in brilliant tempera upon a paper surface; he used
fine brushes made from the most delicate hairs that he could get from
the squirrel, the camel, the goat or the mongoose; 31 and he achieved a
refinement of line and decoration that delight even the foreign and
inexpert eye.</p>
<p>Similar work was done in other parts of India, especially in the
state of Kangra. 32 Another variety of the same genre developed under
the Moguls at Delhi. Rising out of Persian calligraphy and the art of
illuminating manu- scripts, this style grew into a form of aristocratic
portraiture corresponding, in its refinement and exclusivesness, to the
chamber music that flourished at the court. Like the Rajput school, the
Mogul painters strove for delicacy of line, sometimes using a brush made
from a single hair; and .they, too, rivaled one another in the skilful
portrayal of the hand. But they put more color into their drawings, and
less mysticism; they seldom touched religion or mythology; they confined
themselves to the earth, and were as realistic as caution would permit.
Their subjects were living men and women of im- perial position and
temper, not noted for humility; one after another these dignitaries sat
for their portraits, until the picture galleries of that royal
dilettante, Jehangir, were filled with the likenesses of every important
ruler or courtier since the coming of Akbar to the throne. Akbar was the
first of his dynasty to encourage painting; at the end of his reign, if
we may believe Abu-1 Fazl, there were a hundred masters in Delhi, and a
thousand amateurs. 83 Jehangir’s intelligent patronage develope d the
art, and widened its field from portraiture to the representation of
hunting scenes and other natural backgrounds for the human figure —
which still dominated the pic- ture; one minature shows the Emperor
himself almost in the claws of a lion that has clambered upon the rump
of the imperial elephant and is reaching for the royal flesh, while an
attendant realistically takes to his heels. 84 Under Shah Jehan the art
reached its height, and began to decline; as in the case of Japanese
prints, the widened popularity of the form gave it at once a</p>
<p>592 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>wider audience and a less exacting taste. 35 Aurangzeb, by restoring
the strict rule of Islam against images, completed the decay.</p>
<p>Through the intelligent beneficence of the Mogul kings Indian
painters enjoyed at Delhi a prosperity that they had not known for many
centuries. The guild of painters, which had kept itself alive from
Buddhist times, re- newed its youth, and some of its members escaped
from the anonymity with which time’s forgetfulness, and Hindu negligence
of the individual, cover most Indian art. Out of seventeen artists
considered preeminent in Akbar’s reign, thirteen were Hindus. 33 The
most favored of all the painters at the great Mogul’ s court was
Dasvanth, whose lowly origin as the son of a palan- quin-bearer aroused
no prejudice against him in the eyes of the Emperor. The youth was
eccentric, and insisted on drawing pictures wherever he went, and on
whatever surface he found at hand. Akbar recognized his genius, and had
his own drawing-master teach him. The boy became in time the greatest

<p>Wherever men do things, other men will arise who will explain to them
how things should be done. The Hindus, whose philosophy did not exalt
logic, loved logic none the less, and delighted to formulate in the
strictest and most rational rules the subtle procedure of every art. So,
early in our era, the Sandanga , or “Six Limbs of Indian Painting,” laid
down, like a later</p>
<p>We shall be helped in understanding Oriental painting if we remember,
first, that it seeks to represent not things but feelings, and not to
represent but to suggest; that it depends not on color but on line; that
it aims to create esthetic and religious emotion rather than to
reproduce reality; that it is interested in the “soul” or “spirit” of
men and things, rather than in their material forms. Try as we will,
however, we shall hardly find in Indian painting the technical
development, or range and depth of significance, that characterize the
pictorial art of China and Japan. Certain Hindus explain</p>

<p>this very fancifully: painting decayed among them, they tell us,
because it was too easy, it was not a sufficiently laborious gift to
offer to the gods . 80 Perhaps pictures, so mortally frail and
transitory, did not quite satisfy the craving of the Hindu for some
lasting embodiment of his chosen deity. Slowly, as Buddhism reconciled
itself to imagery, and the Brahmanic shrines increased and multiplied,
painting was replaced by statuary, color and line by lasting stone.</p>

<p>We cannot trace the history of Indian sculpture from the statuettes
of Mohenjo-daro to the age of Ashoka, but we may suspect that this is a
gap in our knowledge rather than in the art. Perhaps India, temporarily
im- poverished by the Aryan invasions, reverted from stone to wood for
its statuary; or perhaps the Aryans were too intent upon war to care for
art. The oldest stone figures surviving in India go back only to Ashoka;
but these show a skill so highly developed that we cannot doubt that the
art had then behind it many centuries in growth . 40 Buddhism set up
definite obstacles to both painting and statuary in its aversion to
idolatry and secular imagery: Buddha forbade “imaginative drawings
painted in figures of men and women”; 41 and under this almost Mosaic
prohibition pictorial and plas - tic art suffered in India as it had
done in Judea and was to do in Islam. Gradually this Puritanism seems to
have relaxed as Buddhism yielded its aus- terity and partook more and
more of the Dravidian passion for symbol and myth. When the art of
carving appears again (ca. 200 b.c.), in the stone bas- reliefs on the
“rails” enclosing the Buddhist “stupas” or burial mounds at Bodh-gaya
and Bharhut, it is as a component part of an architectural design rather
than as an independent art; and to the end of its history Indian
sculpture remained for the most part an accessory to architecture, and
pre- ferred relief to carving in the round.* In the Jain temples at
Mathura, and the Buddhist shrines at Amaravati and Ajanta, this art of
relief reached a high point of perfection. The rail at Amaravati, says a
learned authority, “is the most voluptuous and the most delicate flower
of Indian sculpture .” 43</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the province of Gandhara in northwestern India, another
type of sculpture was developing under the patronage of the Kushan
kings. This mysterious dynasty, which came suddenly out of the north —
probably</p>
<ul>
<li>An exception outweighing this generalization was the copper colossus
of Buddha, eighty feet high, which Yuan Chwang saw at Pataliputra;

one ancestor of the great Buddhas at Nara and Kamakura in Japan.</li>

<p>594 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>from Hellenized Bactria — brought with it a tendency to imitate Greek
forms. The Mahay ana Buddhism that captured the council of Kanishka
opened the way by rescinding the prohibition of imagery. Under the
tutelage of Greek instructors Hindu sculpture took on for a time a
smooth Hellenistic face; Buddha was transformed into the likeness of
Apollo, and became an aspirant to Olympus; drapery began to flow about
Hindu deities and saints in the style of Pheidias’ pediments, and pious
Bodhisattwas rubbed elbows with jolly drunken Sileni . 43 Idealized and
almost effeminate representations of the Mas- ter and his disciples were
offset with horrible examples of decadent Greek realism, like the
starving Buddha of Lahore, in which every rib and tendon is shown
underneath a feminine face with ladylike coiffure and masculine beard .
44 This Greco-Buddhist art impressed Yuan Chwang, and through him and
later pilgrims found its way into China, Korea and Japan ; 45 but it had
little influ- ence upon the sculptural forms and methods of India
itself. When, after some centuries of flourishing activity, the Gandhara
school passed away, Indian art came to life again under Hindu rulers,
took up the traditions left by the native artists of Bharhut, Amaravati
and Mathura, and paid scant attention to the Greek interlude at
Gandhara.</p>
<p>Sculpture, like nearly everything else in India, prospered under the
Gupta line. Buddhism had now forgotten its hostility to images; and a
reinvigorated Brahmanism encouraged symbolism and the adornment of
religion with every art. The Mathura Museum holds a highly finished
stone Buddha, with meditative eyes, sensual lips, too graceful a form,
and clumsy Cubist feet. The Sarnath Museum has another stone Buddha, in
the seated pose that was des- tined to dominate Buddhist sculpture; here
the effect of peaceful contempla- tion and a pious kindliness is
perfectly revealed. At Karachi is a small bronze Brahma, scandalously
like Voltaire . 46</p>
<p>Everywhere in India, in the millennium before the coming of the
Moslems, the art of the sculptor, though limitecLas well as inspired by
its subservience to architecture and religion, produced masterpieces.
The pretty statue of Vishnu from Sultanpur , 47 the finely chiseled
statue of Padmapani , 48 the gigan- tic three- faced Shiva (commonly
called “ Trimurti ”) carved in deep relief in the caves at Elephanta ,
49 the almost Praxitelean stone statue worshiped at Nokkas as the
goddess Rukmini , 50 the graceful dancing Shiva, or Nataraja , cast in
bronze by the Chola artist-artisans of Tan j ore , 61 the lovely stone
deer of Mamallapuram , 62 and the handsome Shiva of Perur 68 — these are
evidences of the spread of the carver’s art into every province of
India.</p>
<p>The same motives and methods crossed the frontiers of India proper,
and produced masterpieces from Turkestan and Cambodia to Java and
Ceylon. The student will find examples in the stone head, apparently of
a boy, dug up from the sands of Khotan by Sir Aurel Stein’s expedition ;
64 the head of</p>
<p>INDIAN ART</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>595</p>
<p>Buddha from Siam ; 55 the Egyptianly fine “Harihara ,, of Cambodia ;
58 the mag - nificent bronzes of Java ; 67 the Gandhara-like head of
Shiva from Prambanam ; 58 the supremely beautiful female figure
(“Prajnaparamita”) now in the Leyden Museum; the perfect Bodhisattwa in
the Glyptothek at Copenhagen ; 59 the calm and powerful Buddha , 00 and
the finely chiseled Avalokiteshvara (“The Lord who looks down with pity
upon all men”), 01 both from the great Javanese temple of Borobudur; or
the massive primitive Buddha , 63 and the lovely “moonstone” doorstep ,
03 of Anuradhapura in Ceylon. This dull list of works that must have
cost the blood of many men in many centuries will suggest the influence
of Hindu genius on the cultural colonies of India.</p>
<p>We find it hard to like this sculpture at first sight; only profound
and modest minds can leave their environment behind them when they
travel. We should have to be Hindus, or citizens of those countries that
accepted the cultural leadership of India, to understand the symbolism
of these statues, the complex functions and superhuman powers denoted by
these multiple arms and legs, the terrible realism of these fanciful
figures, expressing the Hindu sense of supernatural forces irrationally
creative, irrationally fertile and irrationally destructive. It shocks
us to find that everybody in Hindu villages is thin, and everybody in
Hindu sculpture is fat; we forget that the statues are mostly of gods,
who received the first fruits of the land. We are discon- certed on
discovering that the Hindus colored their statuary, whereby we reveal
our unawareness of the fact that the Greeks did likewise, and that
something of the classic nobility of the Pheidian deities is due to the
acci- dental disappearance of their paint. We are displeased at the
comparative paucity of female figures in the Indian gallery; we mourn
over the subjec- tion of women which this seems to indicate, and never
reflect that the cult of the nude female is not the indispensable basis
of plastic art, that the pro- foundest beauty of woman may be more in
motherhood than in youth, more in Demeter than in Aphrodite. Or we
forget that the sculptor carved not what he dreamed of so much as what
the priests laid down; that every art, in India, belonged to religion
rather than to art, and was the handmaiden of theology. Or we take too
seriously figures intended by the sculptor to be caricatures, or jests,
or ogres designed to frighten away evil spirits; if we turn away from
them in horror we merely attest the fulfilment of their aim.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the sculpture of India never quite acquired the grace
of her literature, or the sublimity of her architecture, or the depth of
her philosophy; it mirrored chiefly the confused and uncertain insight
of her religions. It excelled the sculpture of China and Japan, but it
never equaled the cold per- fection of Egyptian statuary, or the living
and tempting beauty of Greek marble. To understand even its assumptions
we should have to renew in our hearts the earnest and trusting piety of
medieval days. In truth we ask too</p>
<p>596 the story of civilization (chap.xxi</p>
<p>much of sculpture, as of painting, in India; we judge them as if they
had been there, as here, independent arts, when in truth we have
artificially isolated them for treatment according to our traditional
rubrics and norms. If we could see them as the Hindu knows them, as
integrated parts of the unsurpassed architecture of his country, we
should have made some modest beginning towards understanding Indian
art.</p>
<p>V. ARCHITECTURE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hindu Architecture</li>
</ol>
<p>Before Ashoka — Ashokan — Buddhist — Jain — The masterpieces</p>
<p>of the north — Their destruction — The southern style —</p>
<p>Monolithic temples — Structural temples</p>
<p>Nothing remains of Indian architecture before Ashoka’s time. We have
the brick ruins of Mohenjo-daro, but apparently the buildings of Vedic
and Buddhist India were of wood, and Ashoka seems to have been the first
to use stone for architectural purposes . 64 We hear, in the literature,
of seven- storied structures , 65 and of palaces of some magnificence,
but not a trace of them survives. Megasthenes describes the imperial
residences of Chandragupta as superior to anything in Persia except
Persepolis, on whose model they seem to have been designed . 68 This
Persian influence persisted till Ashoka’s time; it appears in the
ground-plan of his palace, which corresponded with the “Hall of a
Hundred Columns” at Persepolis ; 67 and it show s again in the fine
pillar of Ashoka at Lauriya, crowned with a lion-capital.</p>
<p>With the conversion of Ashoka to Buddhism, Indian architecture began
to throw off this alien influence, and to take its inspiration and it
symbols from the new religion. The transition is evident in the great
capital which is all that now remains of another Ashokan pillar, at
Sarnath ; 68 here, in a composi- tion of astonishing perfection, ranked
by Sir John Marshall as equal to “any - thing of its kind in the ancient
world ,” 60 we have four powerful lions, stand - ing back to back on
guard, and thoroughly Persian in form and countenance; but beneath them
is a frieze of well-carved figures including so Indian a favorite as the
elephant, and so Indian a symbol as the Buddhist Wheel of the Law; and
under the frieze is a great stone lotus, formerly mistaken for a Persian
bell-capital, but now accepted as the most ancient, universal and char-
acteristic of all the symbols in Indian art . 70 Represented upright,
with the petals turned down and the pistil or seed-vessel showing, it
stood for the womb of the world; or, as one of the fairest of nature’s
manifestations, it served as the throne of a god. The lotus or
water-lily symbol migrated with Buddhism, and permeated the art of China
and Japan. A like form, used as</p>
<p>INDIAN ART</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>597</p>
<p>a design for windows and doors, became the “horseshoe arch” of
Ashokan vaults and domes, originally derived from the “covered wagon”
curvature of Bengali thatched roofs supported by rods of bent bamboo.
71</p>
<p>The religious architecture of Buddhist days has left us a few ruined
tem- ples and a large number of “topes” and “rails.” The “tope” or
“stupa” was in early days a burial mound; under Buddhism it became a
memorial shrine, usually housing the relics of a Buddhist saint. Most
often the tope took the form of a dome of brick, crowned with a spire,
and surrounded with a stone rail carved with bas-reliefs. One of the
oldest topes is at Bharhut; but the reliefs there are primitively
coarse. The most ornate of the extant rails is at Amaravati; here 17,000
square feet were covered with minute reliefs of a workmanship so
excellent that Fergusson judged this rail to be “probably the most
remarkable monument in India.” 72 T he best known of the stupas is the
Sanchi tope, one of a group at Bhilsa in Bhopal. The stone gates
apparently imitate ancient wooden forms, and anticipate the pailus or
toriis that usually mark the approach to the temples of the Far East.
Every foot of space on pillars, capitals, crosspieces and supports is
cut into a wilderness of plant, animal, human and divine forms. On a
pillar of the eastern gateway is a delicate carving of a perennial
Buddhist symbol — the Bodhi-tree, scene of the Master’s enli ghtenment;
on the same gateway, gracefully spanning a bracket, is a sensuous
goddess (a Yakshi) with heavy limbs, full hips, slim waist, and
abounding breasts. 73</p>
<p>While the dead saints slept in the topes, the living monks cut into
the mountain rocks temples where they might live in isolation, sloth and
peace, secure from the elements and from the glare and heat of the sun.
We may judge the strength of the religious impulse in India by noting
that over twelve hundred of these cave-temples remain of the many
thousands that were built in the early centuries of our era, partly for
Jains and Brahmans, but mostly for Buddhist communities. Often the
entrance of these viharas (monasteries) was a simple portal in the form
of a “horseshoe” or lotus arch; sometimes, as at Nasik, it was an ornate
fagade of strong columns, animal capitals, and patiently carved
architrave; often it was adorned with pillars, stone screens or
porticoes of admirable design. 7 * The interior included a chatty a or
assembly hall, with colonnades dividing nave from aisles, cells for the
monks on either side, and an altar, bearing relics, at the inner end.*
One of the oldest of these cave-temples, and perhaps the finest now
surviving, is at Karle, between Poona and Bombay; here Hinayana Buddhism
achieved its chef-d’oeuvre.</p>
<ul>
<li>The correspondence of this interior with that of Christian churches
has suggested a possible influence of Hindu styles upon early Christian
architecture . 744</li>
</ul>
<p>598 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>The caves at Ajanta, besides being the hiding-place of the greatest
of Buddhist paintings, rank with Karle as examples of that composite
art, half architecture and half sculpture, which characterizes the
temples of India. Caves I and II have spacious assembly halls whose
ceilings, cut and painted in sober yet elegant designs, are held up by
powerful fluted pillars square at the base, round at the top, ornamented
with flowery bands, and crowned with majestic capitals; 75 Cave XIX is
distinguished by a fagade richly decorated with adipose statuary and
complex bas-reliefs; 70 in Cave XXVI gigantic col- umns rise to a frieze
crowded with figures which only the greatest religious and artistic zeal
could have carved in such detail. 77 Ajanta can hardly be refused the
title of one of the major works in the history of art.</p>
<p>Of other Buddhist temples still existing in India the most impressive
is the great tower at Bodh-gaya, significant for its thoroughly Gothic
arches, and yet dating, apparently, back to the first century a.d . 78
All in all, the remains of Buddhist architecture are fragmentary, and
their glory is more sculptural than structural; a lingering Puritanism,
perhaps, kept them externally forbid- ding and bare. The Jains gave a
more concentrated devotion to architecture, and during the eleventh and
twelfth centuries their temples were the finest in India. They did not
create a style of their own, being content to copy at first (as at
Elura) the Buddhist plan of excavating temples in the mountain rocks,
then the Vishnu or Shiva type of temples rising usually in a walled
group upon a hill. These, too, were externally simple, but inwardly
complex and rich — a happy symbol of the modest life. Piety placed
statue after statue of Jain heroes in these shrines, until in the group
at Shatrunjaya Fergusson counted 6449 figures. 70</p>
<p>The Jain temple at Aihole is built almost in Greek style, with
rectangular form, external colonnades, a portico, and a cell or central
chamber within. 80 At Khajuraho Jains, Vaishnavites and Shivaites, as if
to illustrate Hindu toler- ance, built in close proximity some
twenty-eight temples; among them the almost perfect Temple of
Parshwanath 81 rises in cone upon cone to a majes- tic height, and
shelters on its carved surfaces a veritable city of Jain saints. On Mt.
Abu, lifted four thousand feet above the desert, the Jains built many
temples, of which two survivors, the temples of Vimala and Tejahpala,
are the greatest achievement of this sect in the field of art. The dome
of the Tejahpala shrine is one of those overwhelming experiences which
doom all writing about art to impotence and futility. 88 The Temple of
Vimala, built entirely of white marble, is a maze of irregular pillars,
joined with fanciful brackets to a more simple carved entablature; above
is a marble dome too opulent in statuary, but carved into a stone
lacework of moving magnifi- cence, “finished,” says Fergusson, “with a
delicacy of detail and appropriate - ness of ornament which is probably
unsurpassed by any similar example to</p>
<p>INDIAN ART</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>be found anywhere else. Those introduced by the Gothic architects in
Henry VIPs Chapel at Westminster, or at Oxford, are coarse and clumsy in
com- parison .” 88</p>
<p>In these Jain temples, and their contemporaries, we see the
transition from the circular form of the Buddhist shrine to the tower
style of medieval India. The nave, or pillar-enclosed interior, of the
assembly hall is taken outdoors, and made into a mandapam or porch;
behind this is the cell; and above the cell rises, in successively
receding levels, the carved and complicated tower. It was on this plan
that the Hindu temples of the north were built. The most impressive of
these is the group at Bhuvaneshwara, in the province of Orissa; and the
finest of the group is the Rajarani Temple erected to Vishnu in the
eleventh century a.d. It is a gigantic tower formed of juxtaposed semi-
circular pillars covered with statuary and surmounted by receding layers
of stone, the whole inward-curving tower ending in a great circular
crown and a spire. Nearby is the Lingaraja Temple, larger than the
Rajarani, but not so beautiful; nevertheless every inch of the surface
has felt the sculptor’s chisel, so that the cost of the carving has been
reckoned at three times the cost of the structure . 84 The Hindu
expressed his piety not merely by the imposing grandeur of his temples,
but by their patiently worked detail; nothing was too good for the
god.</p>
<p>It would be dull to list, without specific description and
photographic repre- sentation, the other masterpieces of Hindu building
in the north. And yet no record of Indian civilization could leave
unnoticed the temples of Surya at Kanarak and Mudhera, the tower of
Jagannath Puri, the lovely gateway at Vadnagar , 85 the massive temples
of Sas-Bahu and Teli-ka-Mandir at Gwalior , 80 the palace of Rajah Man
Sing, also at Gwalior , 87 and the Tower of Victory at Chitor . 88
Standing out from the mass are the Shivaite temples at Khajuraho, while
in the same city the dome of the porch of the Khanwar Math Temple shows
again the masculine strength of Indian architecture, and the richness
and patience of Indian carving . 80 Even in its ruins the Temple of
Shiva at Elephanta , with its massive fluted columns, its “mushroom”
capitals, its un - surpassed reliefs, and its powerful statuary , 00
suggests to us an age of national vigor and artistic skill of which
hardly the memory lives today.</p>
<p>We shall never be able to do justice to Indian art, for ignorance
and</p>
<p>fanaticism have destroyed its greatest achievements, and have half
ruined the rest. At Elephanta the Portuguese certified their piety by
smashing statuary and bas-reliefs in unrestrained barbarity; and almost
everywhere in the north the Moslems brought to the ground those triumphs
of Indian architecture, of the fifth and sixth centuries, which
tradition ranks as far</p>
<p>600 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>superior to the later works that arouse our wonder and admiration
today. The Moslems decapitated statues, and tore them limb from limb;
they ap- propriated for their mosques, and in great measure imitated,
the graceful pillars of the Jain temples.” Time and fanaticism joined in
the destruc - tion, for the orthodox Hindus abandoned and neglected
temples that had been profaned by the touch of alien hands.”</p>
<p>We may guess at the lost grandeur of north Indian architecture by the
powerful edifices that still survive in the south, where Moslem rule
entered only in minor degree, and after some habituation to India had
softened Mohammedan hatred of Hindu ways. Further, the great age of
temple architecture in the south came in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, after Akbar had tamed the Moslems and taught them some
appreciation of Indian art. Consequently the south is rich in temples,
usually superior to those that remain standing in the north, and more
massive and impres- sive; Fergusson counted some thirty “Dravidian” or
southern temples any one of which, in his estimate, must have cost as
much as an English</p>
<p>cathedral.” The south adapted the styles of the north by prefacing
the mandapam or porch with a gopuram or gate, and supporting the porch
with a lavish multiplicity of pillars. It played fondly with a
hundred</p>
<p>symbols, from the swastika* emblem of the sun and the wheel of life,
through a very menagerie of sacred animals. The snake, through its
moult- ing, symbolized reincarnation; the bull was the enviable paragon
of pro- creative power; the linga, or phallus, represented the
generative excellence of Shiva, and often determined the form of the
temple itself.</p>
<p>Three elements composed the structural plan of these southern
temples: the gateway, the pillared porch, and the tower ( vivrana ),
which con- tained the main assembly hall or cell. With occasional
exceptions like the palace of Tirumala Nayyak at Madura, all this south
Indian architec- ture was ecclesiastical. Men did not bother to build
magnificently for themselves, but gave their art to the priests and the
gods; no circumstance could better show how spontaneously theocratic was
the real government of India. Of the many buildings raised by the
Chalukyan kings and their people, nothing remains but temples. Only a
Hindu pietist rich in words could describe the lovely symmetry of the
shrine at Ittagi, in Hydera-</p>

<p>bad; M# or the temple at Somnathpur in Mysore,” in which gigantic
masses of stone are carved with the delicacy of lace; or the
Hoyshaleshwara Tem- ple at Halebid,” also in Mysore— “one of the
buildings,” says Fergusson, “on which the advocate of Hindu architecture
would desire to take his stand.” Here, he adds, “the artistic
combination of horizontal with ver - tical lines, and the play of
outline and of light and shade, far surpass any- thing in Gothic art.
The effects are just what the medieval architects were often aiming at,
but which they never attained so perfectly as was done at Halebid.””</p>
<p>If we marvel at the laborious piety that could carve eighteen hundred
feet of frieze in the Halebid temple, and could portray in them two</p>
<p>thousand elephants each different from all the rest,” what shall we
say of the patience and courage that could undertake to cut a complete
temple out of the solid rock? But this was a common achievement of the
Hindu artisans. At Mamallapuram, on the east coast near Madras, they
carved several rathas or pagodas, of which the fairest is the
Dharma-raja-ratha, or monastery for the highest discipline. At Elura, a
place of religious pil- grimage in Hyderabad, Buddhists, Jains and
orthodox Hindus vied in ex- cavating out of the mountain rock great
monolithic temples of which the supreme example is the Hindu shrine of
Kailasha 100 — named after Shiva’s mythological paradise in the
Himalayas. Here the tireless builders cut a hundred feet down into the
stone to isolate the block — 250 by 160 feet — that was to be the
temple; then they carved the walls into powerful pillars, statues and
bas-reliefs; then they chiseled out the interior, and lavished t here
the most amazing art: let the bold fresco of “The Lovers” 1 ” serve as a
specimen. Finally, their architectural passion still unspent, they
carved a series of chapels and monasteries deep into the rock on three
sides of the quarry. 1 ” Some Hindus 103 consider the Kailasha Temple
equal to any achievement in the history of art.</p>
<p>Such a structure, however, was a tour de force, like the Pyramids,
and must have cost the sweat and blood of many men. Either the guilds or
the masters never tired, for they scattered through every province of
southern India gigantic shrines so numerous that the bewildered student
or traveler loses their individual quality in the sum of their number
and their power.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here, says Meadows Taylor, “the carving on some of the pillars, and
of the lintels and architraves of the doors, is quite beyond
description. No chased work in silver or gold could possibly be finer.
By what tools this very hard, tough stone could have been wrought and
polished as it is, is not at all i ntelligible at the present day .”

<p>At Pattadakal Queen Lokamahadevi, one of the wives of the Chalukyan
King Vikramaditya II, dedicated to Shiva the Virupaksha Temple, which
ranks high among the great fanes of India. 104 At Tanjore, south of
Madras, the Chola King Rajaraja the Great, after conquering all southern
India and Ceylon, shared his spoils with Shiva by raising to him a
stately temple designed to represent the generative symbol of the god.*
106 Near Trich- inopoly, west of Tanjore, the devotees of Vishnu erected
on a lofty hill the Shri Rangam Temple, whose distinctive feature was a
many-pillared mandapam in the form of a “Hall of a Thousand Columns,”
each column a single block of granite, elaborately carved; the Hindu
artisans were yet at work completing the temple when they were
scattered, and their labors ended, by the bullets of Frenchmen and
Englishmen fighting for the pos- session of India. 100 Nearby, at
Madura, the brothers Muttu and Tiruma- la Nayyak erected to Shiva a
spacious shrine with another Hall of a</p>
<p>Thousand Columns, a Sacred Tank, and ten gopurams or gateways, of
which four rise to a great height and are carved into a wilderness of
statuary. These structures form together one of the most impressive
sights in India; we may judge from such fragmentary survivals the rich
and spacious architecture of the Vijayanagar kings. Finally, at Ramesh-
varam, amid the archipelago of isles that pave “Adam’s Bridge” from
India to Ceylon, the Brahmans of the south reared through five centuries
( 1 200- 1769 a.d.) a temple whose perimeter was graced with the most
imposing of all corridors or porticoes — four thousand feet of double
colonnades, exquisitely carved, and designed to give cool shade, and
inspiring vistas of sun and sea, to the millions of pilgrims who to this
day find their way from distant cities to lay their hopes and griefs
upon the knees of the care- less gods.</p>

Kandy. The loss of</p>
<p>independence has brought decadence to the upper classes, and the
patron- age and taste that provide a necessary stimulus and restraint
for the artist have disappeared from Ceylon. 100</p>
<p>Strange to say, the greatest of Buddhist temples — some students
would call it the greatest of all temples anywhere 110 — is not in India
but in Java. In the eighth century the Shailendra dynasty of Sumatra
conquered Java, established Buddhism as the official religion, and
financed the building of the massive fane of Borobudur (i.e., “Many
Buddhas”). 111 The temple proper is of moderate size, and of peculiar
design — a small domical stupa surrounded by seventy-two smaller topes
arranged about it in concentric circles. If this were all, Borobudur
would be nothing; what constitutes the grandeur of the structure is the
pedestal, four hundred feet square, an immense mastaba in seven receding
stages. At every turn there are niches for statuary; 436 times the
sculptors of Borobudur thought fit to carve the figure of Buddha. Still
discontent, they cut into the walls of the</p>
<p>stages three miles of bas-reliefs, depicting the legendary birth,
youth and enlightenment of the Master, and with such skill that these
reliefs are among the finest in Asia. 118 With this powerful Buddhist
shrine, and the Brahmanical temples nearby at Prambanam, Javanese
architecture reached its zenith, and quickly decayed. The island became
for a time a maritime power, rose to wealth and luxury, and supported
many poets. But in 1479 the Moslems began to people this tropical
Paradise, and from that time it produced no art of consequence. The
Dutch pounced upon it in 1595, and consumed it, province by province
during the following century, until their control was complete.</p>
<p>Only one Hindu temple surpasses that of Borobudur, and it, too,

<p>turies. In 1858 a French explorer, picking his way through the upper
valley of the Mekong River, caught a glimpse, through trees and brush,
of a sight that seemed to him miraculous: an enormous temple, incredibly
majestic in design, stood amid the forest, intertwined and almost
covered with shrubbery and foliage. That day he saw many temples, some
of them already overgrown or split apart by trees; it seemed that he had
arrived just in time to forestall the triumph of the wilderness over
these works of men. Other Europeans had to come and corroborate his tale
before Henri Mouhot was believed; then scientific expeditions descended
upon the once silent retreat, and a whole school at Par is (L’Ecole de
VExtreme Orient) devoted itself to charting and studying the find. Today
Angkor Wat is one of the wonders of the world.*</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Christian era Indo-China, or Cambodia,
was</p>
<p>inhabited by a people essentially Chinese, partly Tibetan, called
Kham- bujas or Khmers. When Kublai Khan’s ambassador, Tcheou -ta-Kouan,
visited the Khmer capital, Angkor Thom, he found a strong government
ruling a nation that had drawn wealth out of its rice-paddies and its
sweat. The king, Tcheou reported, had five wives: “one special, and four
others for the cardinal points of the compass,” with some four thousand
concu - bines for more precise readings . 111 Gold and jewelry abounded;
pleasure- boats dotted the lake; the streets of the capital were filled
with chariots, curtained palanquins, elephants in rich caparison, and a
population of al- most a million souls. Hospitals were attached to the
temples, and each had its corps of nurses and physicians. 11 ’</p>
<p>Though the people were Chinese, their culture was Hindu. Their
re-</p>
<p>ligion was based upon a primitive worship of the serpent, Naga, whose
fanlike head appears everywhere in Cambodian art; then the great gods of
the Hindu triad — Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva — entered through Burma;
almost at the same time Buddha came, and was joined with Vishnu and
Shiva as a favorite divinity of the Khmers. Inscriptions tell of the
enor- mous quantity of rice, butter and rare oils contributed daily by
the people to the ministrants of the gods. 11 ’</p>
<p>To Shiva the Khmers, toward the end of the ninth century, dedicated
the oldest of their surviving temples — the Bayon, now a forbidding ruin

<p>cement, have drawn apart in the course of a thousand years,
stretching into ungodly grins the great faces of Brahma and Shiva which
almost con- stitute the towers. Three centuries later the slaves and
war-captives of the kings built Angkor Wat, m a masterpiece equal to the
finest archi- tectural achievements of the Egyptians, the Greeks, or the
cathedral- builders of Europe. An enormous moat, twelve miles in length,
sur-</p>
<p>rounds the temple; over the moat runs a paved bridge guarded by
dissua- sive Nagas in stone; then an ornate enclosing wall; then
spacious galleries, whose reliefs tell again the tales of the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana ; then the stately edifice itself, rising
upon a broad base, by level after level of a terraced pyramid, to the
sanctuary of the god, two hundred feet high. Here magnitude does not
detract from beauty, but helps it to an impos- ing magnificence that
startles the Western mind into some weak realiza- tion of the ancient
grandeur once possessed by Oriental civilization. One sees in
imagination the crowded population of the capital: the regimented slaves
cutting, pulling and raising the heavy stones; the artisans carving
reliefs and statuary as if time would never fail them; the priests
deceiving and consoling the people; the devadasis (still pictured on the
granite) de- ceiving the people and consoling the priests; the lordly
aristocracy build- ing palaces like the Phinean-Akas, with its spacious
Terrace of Honor; and, raised above all by the labor of all, the
powerful and ruthless kings.</p>
<p>The kings, needing many slaves, waged many wars. Often they won; but
near the close of the thirteenth century — “in the middle of the way” of
Dante’s life— the armies of Siam defeated the Khmers, sacked their
cities, and left their resplendent temples and palaces in ruins. Today a
few tourists prowl among the loosened stones, and observe how patiently
the trees have sunk their roots or insinuated their branches into the
crevices of the rocks, slowly tearing them apart because stones cannot
desire and grow. Tcheou-ta-Kouan speaks of the many books that were
written by the people of Angkor, but not a page of this literature
remains; like our- selves they wrote perishable thoughts upon perishable
tissue, and all their immortals are dead. The marvelous reliefs show men
and women wearing veils and nets to guard against mosquitoes and slimy,
crawling things. The men and women are gone, surviving only on the
stones. The mos- quitoes and the lizards remain.</p>
<p>Nearby, in Siam, a people half Tibetan and half Chinese had gradually
expelled the conquering Khmers, and had developed a civilization based
upon</p>
<p>606 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Hindu religion and art. After overcoming Cambodia the Siamese built a
new capital, Ayuthia, on the site of an ancient city of the Khmers. From
this seat they extended their sway until, about 1600, their empire
included south- ern Burma, Cambodia, and the Malay Peninsula. Their
trade reached to China on the east and to Europe on the west. Their
artists made illuminated manu- scripts, painted with lacquer on wood,
fired porcelain in the Chinese style, embroidered beautiful silks, and
occasionally carved statues of unique ex- cellence.* Then, in the
impartial rhythm of hjstory, the Burmese captured Ayuthia, and destroyed
it with all its art. In their new capital at Bangkok the Siamese built a
great pagoda, whose excess of ornament cannot quite conceal the beauty
of its design.</p>
<p>The Burmese were among the greatest builders in Asia. Coming down
into these fertile fields from Mongolia and Tibet, they fell under Hindu
influences, and from the fifth century onward produced an abundance of
Buddhist, Vaishnavite and Shivaite statuary, and great stupas that
culminated in the majestic temple of Ananda — one of the five thousand
pagodas of their ancient capital, Pagan. Pagan was sacked by Kublai
Khan, and for five hundred years the Burmese government vacillated from
capital to capital. For a time Manda- lay flourished as the center of
Burma’s life, and the home of artists who achieved beauty in many fields
from embroidery and jewelry to the royal palace — which showed what they
could do in the frail medium of wood. 118 The English, displeased with
the treatment of their missionaries and their merchants, adopted Burma
in 1886, and moved the capital to Rangoon, a city amenable to the
disciplinary influence of the Imperial Navy. There the Burmese had built
one of their finest shrines, the famous Shwe Dagon, that Golden Pagoda
which draws to its spire millions upon millions of Burmese Buddhist
pilgrims every year. For does not this temple contain the very hairs of
Shakya- muni’s head?</p>

<p>The final triumph of Indian architecture came under the Moguls. The
followers of Mohammed had proved themselves master builders wher- ever
they had carried their arms — at Granada, at Cairo, at Jerusalem, at
Baghdad; it was to be expected that this vigorous stock, after
establish- ing itself securely in India, would raise upon the conquered
soil mosques</p>

<p>as resplendent as Omar’s at Jerusalem, as massive as Hassan’s at
Cairo, and as delicate as the Alhambra. It is true that the “Afghan”
dynasty used Hindu artisans, copied Hindu themes, and even appropriated
the pillars of Hindu temples, for their architectural purposes, and that
many mosques were merely Hindu temples rebuilt for Moslem prayer”” but
this nat ural imitation passed quickly into a style so typically Moorish
that one is sur- prised to find the Taj Mahal in India rather than in
Persia, North Africa or Spain.</p>
<p>The beautiful Kutb-Minar* exemplifies the transition. It was part
of</p>
<p>a mosque begun at Old Delhi by Kutbu-d Din Aibalc; it commemorated
the victories of that bloody Sultan over the Hindus, and twenty-seven
Hindu temples were dismembered to provide material for the mosque and
the tower. 120 After withstanding the elements for seven centuries the
great minaret — 250 feet high, built of fine red sandstone, perfectly
propor- tioned, and crowned on its topmost stages with white marble — is
still one of the masterpieces of Indian technology and art. In general
the Sultans of Delhi were too busy with killing to have much time for
architecture, and such buildings as they have left us are mostly the
tombs that they raised during their own lifetime as reminders that even
they would die. The best example of these is the mausoleum of Sher Shah
at Sasseram, in Bihar; m gigantic, solid, masculine, it was the last
stage of the more virile Moorish manner before it softened into the
architectural jewelry of the Mogul kings.</p>
<p>The tendency to unite the Mohammedan and the Hindu styles was</p>
<p>fostered by the eclectic impartiality of Akbar; and the masterpieces
that his artisans built for him wove Indian and Persian methods and
motifs into an exquisite harmony symbolizing the frail merger of native
and Moslem creeds in Akbar’s synthetic faith. The firs t monument of his
reign, the tomb erected by him near Delhi for his father Humayun, is
already in a style of its own — simple in line, moderate in decoration,
but foreshadowing in its grace the fairer edifices of Shah Jehan. At
Fath- pur-Sikri his artists built a city in which all the strength of
the early</p>
<p>Moguls merged with the refinement of the later emperors. A flight of
steps leads up to an imposing portal in red sandstone, through whose
lordly arch one passes into an enclosure filled with chef -d’ oeuvres.

<p>major building is a mosque, but the loveliest of the structures are
the three pavilions for the Emperor’s favorite wives, and th e marble
tomb of his friend, Salim Chisti the sage; here the artists of India
began to show that skill in embroidering stone which was to culminate in
the screen of the Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>Jehangir contributed little to the architectural history of his
people,</p>
<p>but his son Shah Jehan made his name almost as bright as Akbar’s by
his passion for beautiful building. He scattered money as lavishly among
his artists as Jehangir had scattered it among his wives. Like the kings
of northern Europe, he imported the surplus artists of Italy, and had
them instruct his own carvers in that art of pietra dura (i.e., of
inlaying marble with a mosaic of precious stones) which became one of
the char- acteristic elements of Indian adornment during his reign.
Jehan was not a very religious soul, but two of the fairest mosques in
India rose under his patronage: the Juma Masjid — or Friday Mosque — at
Delhi, and the Moti Masjid — or Pearl Mosque — at Agra.</p>
<p>Both at Delhi and at Agra Jehan built “forts”— i.e., groups of
royal</p>
<p>edifices surrounded by a protective wall. At Delhi he tore down with
superior disdain the pink palaces of Akbar, and replaced them with</p>
<p>structures which at their worst are a kind of marble confectionery,
and at their best are the purest architectural beauty on the globe. Here
is the luxurious Hall of Public Audience, with panels of Florentine
mosaic on a black marble ground, and with ceilings, columns and arches
carved into stone lacery of frail but incredible beauty. Here, too, is
the Hall of Private Audience, whose ceiling is of silver and gold, whose
columns are of filigree marble, whose arches are a pointed semicircle
composed of smaller flowerlike semicircles, whose Peacock Throne became
a legend for the world, and whose wall still bears in precious inlay the
proud</p>
<p>words of the Moslem poet: “If anywhere on earth there is a Paradise,
it is here, it is here, it is here.” We gather again some faint
conception of “the riches of the Indies” in Mogul days when we find the
greatest of the historians of architecture describing the royal
residence at Delhi as covering twice the area of the vast Escorial near
Madrid, and forming at that time, and in its ensemble, “the most
magnificent palace in the East— perhaps in the world.”*” 3</p>

<p>The Fort at Agra is in ruins,* and we can only guess at its
original</p>
<p>magnificence. Here, amid many gardens, were the Pearl Mosque, the Gem
Mosque, the halls of Public and Private Audience, the Throne Palace, the
King’s Baths, the Hall of Mirro rs, the palaces of Jehangir and of</p>
<p>Shah Jehan, the Jasmine Palace of Nur Jehan, and that Jasmine Tower
from which the captive emperor, Shah Jehan, looked over the Jumna upon
the tomb that he had built for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.</p>
<p>All the world knows that tomb by her shortened name as the Taj</p>
<p>Mahal. Many an architect has rated it as the most perfect of all
buildings standing on the earth today. Three artists designed it: a
Persian, Ustad Isa; an Italian, Gieronimo Veroneo; and a Frenchman,
Austin de Bordeaux. No Hindu seems to have shared in its conception; it
is utterly un-Hindu, completely Mohammedan; even the skilled artisans
were, in part, brought in from Baghdad, Constantinople, and other
centers of the Moslem faith. 1 * For twenty-two years twenty-two
thousand workmen were forced to labor upon the Taj; and though the
Maharaja of Jaipur sent the marble as a gift to Shah Jehan, the building
and its surroundings cost 30,000,000 — then an enormous sum. 1 *!</p>
<p>Only St. Peter’s has so fi tting an approach. Passing through a
high</p>
<p>battlemented wall, one comes suddenly upon the Taj — raised upon a
marble platform, and framed on either side by handsome mosques and
stately minarets. In the foreground spacious gardens enclose a pool in
whose waters the inverted palace becomes a quivering fascination. Every
portion of the structure is of white marble, precious metals, or costly
stones. The building is a complex figure of twelve sides, four of which
are portals; a slender minaret rises at each comer, and the roof is a
massive spired dome. The main entrance, once guarded with solid silver
gates, is a maze of marble embroidery; inlaid in the wall in jeweled
script are quotations from the Koran , one of which invites the “pure in
heart” to en ter “the gardens of Paradise.” The interior is simple; and
perhaps it is</p>

<p>fLord William Bentinck, one of the kindliest of the British governors

<p>just as well that native and European thieves cooperated in
despoiling the tomb of its superabundant jewels, and of the golden
railing, encrusted with precious stones, that once enclosed the
sarcophagi of Jehan and his Queen. For Aurangzeb replaced the railing
with an octagonal screen of almost transparent marble, carved into a
miracle of alabaster lace; and it has seemed to some visitors that of
all the minor and partial products of human art nothing has ever
surpassed the beauty of this screen.</p>
<p>It is not the most sublime of all edifices, it is only the most
beautiful. At any distance that hides its delicate details it is not
imposing, but merely pleasing; only a nearer view reveals that its
perfection has no proportion to its size. When in our hurried time we
see. enormous structures of a hundred stories raised in a year or two,
and then consider how twenty-two thousand men toiled for twenty-two
years on this little tomb, hardly a hundred feet high, we begin to sense
the difference between industry and art. Perhaps the act of will
involved in conceiving a building like the Taj Mahal was greater and
profounder than the act of will of the greatest conqueror. If time were
intelligent it would destroy everything else before the Taj, and would
leave this evidence of man’s alloyed nobility as the last man’s
consolation.</p>

<li>Indian Architecture and Civilization</li>

<p>Decay of Indian art — Hindu and Moslem architecture compared</p>
<p>— General view of Indian civilization</p>
<p>Despite the screen, Aurangzeb was a misfortune for Mogul and Indian
art. Dedicated fanatically to an exclusive religion, he saw in art
nothing but idolatry and vanity. Already Shah Jehan had prohibited the
erection of Hindu temples ; 127 Aurangzeb not only continued the ban,
but gave so economical a support to Moslem building that it, too,
languished under his reign. Indian art followed him to the grave.</p>
<p>When we think of Indian architecture in summary and retrospect we
find in it two themes, masculine and feminine, Hindu and Mohammedan,
about which the structural symphony revolves. As, in the most famous of
symphonies, the startling hammer-strokes of the opening bars are shortly
followed by a strain of infinite delicacy, so in Indian architecture the
over- powering monuments of the Hindu genius at Bodh-Gaya,
Bhuvaneshwara, Madura and Tan j ore are followed by the grace and melody
of the Mogul style at Fathpur-Sikri, Delhi and Agra; and the two themes
mingle in a</p>

<p>confused elaboration to the end. It was said of the Moguls that they
built like giants and finished liked jewelers; but this epigram might
better have been applied to Indian architecture in general: the Hindus
built like giants, and the Moguls ended like jewelers. Hindu
architecture impresses us in its mass, Moorish architcture in its
detail; the first had the sublimity of strength, the other had the
perfection of beauty; the Hindus had passion and fertility, the Moors
had taste and self-restraint. The Hindu covered his buildings with such
exuberant statuary that one hesitates whether to class them as building
or as sculpture; the Mohammedan abominated images, and confined himself
to floral or geometrical decoration. The Hindus were the Gothic
sculptor- architects of India’s Middle Ages; the Moslems were the
expatriated artists of the exotic Renaissance. All in all, the Hindu
style reached greater heights, in proportion as sublimity excels
loveliness; on second thought we perceive that Delhi Fort and the Taj
Mahal, beside Angkor and Borobudur, are beautiful lyrics beside profound
dramas — Petrarch beside Dante, Keats beside Shakespeare, Sappho beside
Sophocles. One art is the graceful and partial expression of fortunate
individuals, the other is the complete and powerful expression of a
race.</p>
<p>Hence this little survey must conclude as it began, by confessing
that none but a Hindu can quite appreciate the art of India, or write
about it forgivably. To a European brought up on Greek and aristocratic
canons of moderation and simplicity, this popular art of profuse
ornament and wild complexity will seem at times almost primitive and
barbarous. But that last word is the very adjective with which the
classically-minded Goethe rejected Strasbourg’s cathedral and the Gothic
style; it is the reaction of reason to feeling, of rationalism to
religion. Only a native believer can feel the majesty of the Hindu
temples, for these were built to give not merely a form to beauty but a
stimulus to piety and a pedestal to faith. Only our Middle Ages — only
our Giottos and our Dantes — could under- stand India.</p>
<p>It is in these terms that we must view all Indian civilization — as
the ex- pression of a “medieval” people to whom religion is profounder
than science, if only because religion accepts at the outset the
eternity of human ignorance and the vanity of human power. In this piety
lie the weakness and the strength of the Hindu: his superstition and his
gentle- ness, his introversion and his insight, his backwardness and his
depth, his weakness in war and his achievement in art. Doubtless his
climate affected his religion, and cooperated with it to enfeeble him;
therefore he yielded</p>
<p>612 the story of civilization (chap. XXI</p>
<p>with fatalistic resignation to the Aryans, the Huns, the Moslems and
the Europeans. History punished him for neglecting science; and when
Clive’s superior cannon slaughtered the native army at Plassey (1757),
their roar announced the Industrial Revolution. In our time that
Revolution will have its way with India, as it has written its will and
character upon</p>
<p>England, America, Germany, Russia and Japan; India, too, will have
her capitalism and her socialism, her millionaires and her slums. The
old civilization of India is finished. It began to die when the British
came.</p>
