<h4 id="chapter-x-napoleon-himself">CHAPTER X Napoleon Himself</h4>
<p>I. BODY</p>
<p>W E must not picture, him as Gros painted him in 1796 — standard in
one hand, drawn sword in the other, costume ornate with colored sash</p>
<p>and official insignia, long chestnut hair wild in the wind, eyes,
brow, and lips fixed in determination; this seems too ideal to be true.
Two years younger than his twenty-seven-year-old hero, Gros is said to
have seen him planting that standard on the bridge at Arcole, 1 but the
painting is probably the prod- uct of ardent idolatry — the man of art
worshiping the men of deeds. And yet, two years later, Guerin portrayed
Napoleon with essentially the same features: hair falling over forehead
and shoulders, brows arched over eyes somber and resolute, nose going
straight to the point like his will, lips closed tight as of a mind made
up. This too is but one aspect of the man — the mar- tial; there were
many other moods that could relax those lineaments, as in his playful
pulling or his secretary’s ears, or in his paternal ecstasy over the
infant “King of Rome.” By 1802 he had discarded those long locks 2 — all
but one which dangled over a receding forehead. He put on weight after
forty years, and sometimes used his paunch to support his hand.
Frequently, espe- cially when walking, he clasped his hands behind his
back; this became so habitual that it almost always betrayed him at a
masquerade. Throughout his life his hands attracted attention by the
perfection of their skin and the tapering fingers; indeed, he was quite
proud of all four of his extremities. However, Las Cases, who thought
him a god, could not help smiling at those “ridiculously handsome
hands.” 3</p>
<p>He was absurdly short for a general, being only five feet and six
inches in height; 4 the command had to be in the eyes. Cardinal Caprara,
coming to negotiate the Concordat, wore “an immense pair of green
spectacles” to soften the glare of Napoleon’s eyes. General Vandamme,
fearing the ir hyp- nosis, confessed, “That devil of a man exercises
upon me a fascination that I cannot explain to myself; and in such
degree that though I fear neither God nor devil, I am ready to tremble
like a child when I am in his presence, and he could make me go through
the eye of a needle to throw myself into the fire.” 5 The Emperor’s
complexion was sallow, brightened, however, by facial muscles quickly
reflecting — if he wished — each turn of feeling or idea. Napoleon’s
head was large for h is stature, but was well shaped; his shoulders were
broad, his chest well developed, suggesting a strong constitution. He
dressed simply, leaving finery to his marshals; his complex hat,
spreading like a folded waffle, had no adornment but a tricolor
cockade.* Usually he wore</p>

<p>Xa gray coat over the uniform of a colonel of his guard. He carried a
snuffbox on his waistband, and resorted to it occasionally. He preferred
knee breeches and silk stockings to pantaloons. He never wore jewelry,
but his shoes were lined with silk and bound with buckles of gold. In
dress, as in his final politi- cal philosophy, he belonged to the Ancien
Regime.</p>
<p>He was “scrupulously neat in his person.” 7 He had a passion for warm
baths, sometimes lingering in them for two hours; probably he found in
them some relief from nervous tensions, muscular pains, and an itching
skin disease that he had contracted at Toulon. 8 He used eau-de-cologne
on his neck and torso as well as on his face. 9 He was “exceedingly
temperate” in food and drink; diluted his wine with water, 10 like the
ancient Greeks; and usually gave only ten or fifteen minutes to his
lunch. On campaigns he ate as chance allowed, and often hurriedly;
sometimes this led to indigestion, and at the most critical moments, as
at the battles of Borodino and Leipzig. 11 He suffered from
constipation; in 1797 he added hemorrhoids, which he claimed to have
cured with leeches. 12 “I never saw him ill,” said Meneval, but he
added: “He was only occasionally subject to vomiting bile, which never
left any aftereffects…. He had feared, for some time, that he was
affected with a disease of the bladder, because the keen air of the
mountains caused him a kind of dysuria; but this fear was found to be
without founda- tion.” 13 However, there is considerable evidence that
in his later life Napo - leon was afflicted with inflammation of the
urinary tract, sometimes leading to painful and inconveniently frequent
urination. 14 His overstrung nerves sometimes (as at Mainz in 1806)
collapsed into convulsions partly resem- bling epileptic seizures; but
it is now generally agreed that he was not sub- ject to epilepsy. 15</p>
<p>There is no such agreement about the imperial stomach. “In all my
life,” he told Las Cases on September 16, 1816, “I never had either a
headache or a pain in my stomach.” Meneval corroborated him: “I have
never heard him complain of pain in the stomach.” 16 However, Bourrienne
reported having more than once seen Napoleon suffering such stomach
pains that “I would then accompany him to his bedchamber, and have often
been obliged to support him.” In Warsaw, in 1806, after violent stomach
pains, he predicted</p>
<p>He refused to treat his ailments with medicine. As a general
accustomed to wounded soldiers, he admitted the need of surgery; but as
for drugs, he dis- trusted their side effects, and preferred, when ill,
to fast, drink barley water, lemonade, or water containing orange
leaves, to take vigorous exercise to promote perspiration , and let the
body heal itself. “Up to 1816,” Las Cases reported, “the Emperor did not
recollect having ever taken medicine”; 19 but the imperial memory was
then susceptible to wishful forgetting. “Doctor,” he explained to the
physician of the S.S. N orthumberland on the way to</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>St. Helena, “our body is a machine for the purpose of life; it is
organized to that end — that is its nature. Leave the life there at its
ease; let it take care of itself; it will do be tter than if you
paralyze it by loading it with medicines.” 20 He never tired of teasing
his favorite physician, Corvisart, about the useless- ness of medicine;
finally he led him to agree that, all in all, drugs had done more harm
than good. 21 He amused his final physician, Francesco Antom- marchi, by
asking him which of the two groups, the generals or the doctors, would,
at the Last Judgment, be found responsible for the greater number of
deaths.</p>
<p>Despite his ailments, he had in him a fund of energy that never
failed till Moscow burned. An appointment to service under him was no
bureaucratic sinecure, but almost a sentence to slow death; many a proud
official crept away exhausted after five or six years of keeping the
Emperor’s pace. One of his appointees complimented himself on not being
stationed in Paris: there “I should die of application before the end of
the month. He has already killed Portalis, Cretet, and almost Treilhard,
who was tough; he could no lon ger urinate, nor the others either.” 22
Napoleon admitted the high mor - tality among his aides. “The lucky
man,” he said, “is he who hides away from me in the depths of some
province.” 23 When he asked Louis -Philippe de Segur what people would
say of him after his death, and Segur replied that they would express
universal regret, Napoleon corrected him: “Not at</p>
<p>He wore himself out as he did others; the engine was too strong for
the body. He crowded a century of events into twenty years because he
com- pressed a week into a day. He came to his desk about 7 a.m., and
expected his secretary to be available at any hour; “Come,” he called to
Bourrienne, “let us go to work.” 25 “Be here tonight at one o’clock, or
four, in the morn - ing,” he said to Meneval, “and we will work
together.” 20 Three or four days a week he attended the meetings of the
Council of State. “I am always working,” he told Councilor Roederer; “I
work when I am dining , I work at the theater; in the middle of the
night I wake up and work.”</p>
<p>We might have supposed that these full and exciting days would be
paid for by sleepless nights, but Bourrienne assures us that the Emperor
slept well enough — seven hours at night, and “a short nap in the
afternoon.” 27 He</p>

<p>Xpower and fame, ascribed to his master “the highest intellect which
has ever been granted to a human being.”® 0 Taine, the most brilliant
and indefatigable opponent of Napoleolatry, marveled at the Emperor’s
capacity for long and intense mental labor; “never has a brain so
disciplined and under such control been seen.” 31 Let us agree that
Napoleon’s was among; the most perceptive, penetrating, retentive, and
logical minds ever seen in, one who was pre- dominantly a man of action.
He liked to sign h imself as a “member of the Institute,” and he once
expressed to Laplace his regret that “force of cir - cumstances had led
him so far from the career of a scientist”; 32 at that mo - ment he
might have ranked the man who adds to human understanding abov e the man
who adds to man’s power.* However, he could be forgiven for scorning the
“ideologues” of the Institute, who mistook ideas for realities,
explained the universe, and proposed to tell him how to govern France.
His mind had the defects of a romantic imagination, but it had the
realistic stimulus of daily contact with the flesh and blood of life.
His persistent men- tal activity was part and servant of persistent
action at the highest level of statesmanship.</p>
<p>First of all, he was sensitive. He suffered from the keenness of his
senses: His ears multiplied sounds, his nose multiplied odors, his eyes
penetrated sur- faces and appearances, and discarded the incidental to
clarify the significant. He was curious and asked thousands of
questions, read hundreds of books, studied maps and histories, visited
factories and farms; Las Cases was amazed at the range of his interest,
the scope of his knowledge about countries and centuries. He had a
memory made tenacious and selective by the intensity and character of
his aims; he knew what to forget and what to retain. He was orderly: the
unity and hierarchy of his desires imposed a clarifying and directive
order upon his ideas, actions, policies, and government. He re- quired
from his aides reports and recommendations composed not of elo- quent
abstractions and admirable ideals but of definite objectives, factual
information, practical measures, and calculable results; he studied,
checked, and classified this material in the light of his experience and
purposes, and issued instructions decisive and precise. We know of no
other government in history that worked with such orderly preparation to
such orderly adminis- tration. With Napoleon the ecstasy of liberty,
yielded to the dictatorship of order.</p>
<p>By projecting his memories into anticipations, he became skilled in
calcu- lating the results of possible responses, and in predicting the
plans and moves of his foes. “I meditate a great deal,” he said. “If I
seem equ al to the occa- sion, and ready to face it when it comes, it is
because I have thought the matter over a long time before undertaking
it…. I have anticipated what- ever might happen. It is no genie [ djinn
] which suddenly reveals to me what I ought to do or say,… but my own
reflection.” 34 So he prepared in detail the campaigns of Marengo and
Austerlitz, and predicted not only the results</p>
<ul>

in an attic and written four b ooks”; i.e., he would have been another

<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>2 4 !</p>
<p>but the time they would require. At the summit of his development
(1807) he was able to keep his wishes from obscuring his vision; he
tried to antici- pate difficulties, hazards, surprises, and planned to
meet them. “When I plan a battle no man is more pusillanimous than I am.
I magnify to myself all the evils possible under the circumstances.” 35
His first rule in case of unforeseen</p>
<p>His judgment of men was usually as penetrating as his calculation of
events. He di d, not trust appearances or protestations; a person’s
character, he thought, does not appear on his face until he is old, and
speech conceals as often as it reveals. He studied himself ceaselessly,
and on that basis he pre- sumed that all men and women were led in their
conscious actions and thought by self-interest. He who was the object of
so much devotion (from Desaix, Lannes, Meneval, Las Cases… and those
soldiers who, dying, cried 11 Vive rEmpereur!”) could not conceive of a
selfless devotion. Behind every word and deliberate deed he saw the
tireless grasp of the ego — the strong man’s ambition, the weak man - s
fear, the woman’s vanity or stratagem. He sought out each person’s ruli
ng passion or vulnerable frailty, and</p>
<p>upon it to mold him to imperial aims.</p>
<p>Despite all forethought and foresight he made (to our hindsight) an
am- ple variety of mistakes, both in judging men and in calculating
results. He might have known that Josephine could not bear a month of
chastity, and that Marie Louise could not tie Austria to peace. He
thought he had charmed Alexander at Tilsit and Erfurt, while the Czar,
with Talleyrand’s coaching, was deceiving him elegantly. It was a
mistake to intensify British hostility in 1802 by so boldly extending
his power over Piedmont, Lom- bardy, and Switzerland; a mistake to put
his brothers on thrones too big for their brains; a mistake to suppose
that the German states in the Confeder- ation of the Rhine would submit
to French sovereignty when a chance came to break away; a mistake to
publish a document that showed him thinking of conquering Turkey; a
mistake (as he later confessed) to waste the Grand Army in Spain; a
mistake to invade endless Russia, or remain there as winter neared.
Supreme over so many men, he was subject, as he said, to the “nature of
things,” to the surprises of events, the frailties of disease, the
inadequacies of his power. “I have conceived many plans,” he said, “but
I was ne ver free to execute one of them. For all that I held the
rudder, and with a strong hand, the waves were a good deal stronger. I
was never in truth my own master; I was, always governed by
circumstance.” 39</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XAnd by imagination. His soul was a battleground between keen
observa- tion enlightening reason and vivid imaginings clouding it with
romance, even with superstition; now and then he dallied with omens and
horo- scopes. 40 When he went to Egypt he took with him many books of
science and many of sentiment or fancy — Rousseau’s La Nouvelle
Helo’ise, Goethe’s Werther, Macpherson’s “Ossian”; 41 he confessed later
that he had read Wer - ther seven times; 42 and in the end he concluded
that “imagination rules the world.” 43 Stranded in Egypt, he fed on
dreams of winning India; struggling through Syria, he pictured himself
conquering Constantinople with his hand- ful of men, and then marching
upon Vienna like a more invincible Suleiman. As power drove cautio n out
of his blood he ignored Goethe’s warning of Entsagen — the
acknowledgment of bounds; his proliferating successes chal- lenged the
gods — violated the calculus of limitations; and in the end he found
himself petulant and helpless, chained to a rock in the sea.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>CHARACTER</li>
</ol>
<p>His pride had begun with the self-centeredness natural to all
organisms. In his youth it swelled defensively in the clash of
individuals and families in Corsica, and then against the class and
racial arrogance of students at Bri- enne. It was not by any means pure
selfishness; it allowed devotion and gen- erosity to his mother, to
Josephine and her children; love for the “King of Rome”; and an
impatient affection for his brothers and sisters, who also had selves to
pamper and preserve. But as his successes widened, his power and
responsibilities, his pride and self-absorption, grew. He tended to take
nearly all the credit for his armies’ victories, bu t he praised, loved,
and mourned Desaix and Lannes. Finally he identified his country with
himself, and his ego swelled with her frontiers.</p>
<p>His pride, or the consciousness of ability, sometimes descended to
vanity, or the display of accomplishments. “ Well, Bourrienne, you too
will be im- mortal.” “Why, General?” “Are you not my secretary?” “Tell
me the name of Alexander’s.” “Hm, that is not bad, Bourrienne.” 44 He
wrote to Viceroy</p>
<p>Eugene (April 14, 1806): “My Italian people must know me well enough
not to forget that there is more in my little finger than in all their
brains put together.” 45 The letter N, blazoned in a thousand places,
was occasionally graced with a / for Josephine. The Emperor felt that
showmanship was a necessary prop of rule.</p>
<p>“Power is my mistress,” he declared to Roederer in 1804, when Joseph
was angling to be declared heir; “I have worked too hard at her conquest
to allow anyone to take her away from me, or even to covet her…. Two
weeks ago I would not have dreamed of treating him unjustly. Now I am
unforgiving. I shall smile at him with my lips — but he has slept with
my mistress.” 46 (Here he did himself injustice; he was a jealous lover,
but he was</p>

<p>uniting Western Europe, forcibly including the Papal States; then of
follow- ing Constantine from France through Milan to the capture of
Constanti- nople, building classic arches to commemorate his victories;
then he found Europe too little, a mere “molehill,” 48 and proposed to
rival Alexander by conquering India. It would be hard work, for himself
and a million troops, but it would be repaid in glory, for him and them;
and if death overtook them on the way it would not be too great a price
to pay. “Death is nothing; but to live defeated and inglorious is t o
die daily.” 49 “I live only for pos - terity.” 50 La gloire became his
ruling passion, so hypnotic that for a decade</p>
<p>He pursued his aims with a will that never bent except to leap —
until he had exhausted the sublime and became pitiful. His unresting
ambition gave unity to his will, direction and substance to every day.
At Brienne, “even when I had nothing [assigned?] to do, I always felt
that I had no time to lose.” 51 And to Jerome in 1805: “What I am I owe
to strength of will, to character, application, and audacity.” 52 Daring
was part of his strategy; time</p>
<p>Sometimes his judgment and conduct were clouded and perverted with
passion. His temper was as short as his stature, and it shortened as his
power spread. He had the heat and wilds of Corsica in his blood; and
though he usually managed to check his wrath, those around him, from
Josephine to his powerful bodyguard Roustam, watched their every word
and move lest they incur his wrath. He became impatient with
contradiction, tardiness, incompetence, or stupidity. When he lost his
temper he would publicly berate an ambassador, swear at a bishop, kick
philosopher Volney in the stomach, or, faute de rnieux , boot a log on
the hearth. 54 And yet his anger cooled almost as soon as it flared;
often it was put on, as a move in the chess of politics; in most cases
he made amends a day or a minute afterward. 55 He was seldom brutal,
often kind, playful, good-humored, 56 but his sense of humor had been
weakened by hardship and battle; he had little time for the pleasantries
of leisure, the gossip of the court, or the wit of the salons. He was a
man in a hurry, with a pack of enemies around him, and an em- pire on
his hands; and it is difficult for a man in a hurry to be civilized.</p>
<p>He spent too much of his energy conquering half of Europe to have
much left for the absurdities of coitus. He suspected that many forms of
sexual desire were environmentally learned rather than hereditary:
“Everything is conventional among men, even to those feelings which, one
would sup- pose, ought to be dictated by Natu re alone.” 57 He could
have had a covey of concubines in the full Bourbon tradition, but he
made do with half a dozen mistresses spaced between campaigns. Women
thought themselves immortal if they amused him for a night; usually he
dispatched the matter with brutal brevity, and talked about his late
partners with more coarseness</p>

<p>Xhan gratitude. 58 His infidelities caused Josephine many hours of
worry and grief; he explained to her (if we may believe Mme. de Remusat)
that these divertimenti were natural, necessary, and customary, and
should be over- looked by an understanding wife; she wept, he comforted
her, she forgave him. 59 Otherwise he was as good a husband as his cares
and wanderings would allow.</p>
<p>When Marie Louise came to him he accepted monogamy (so far as we
know) with new grace, if only because adultery might lose him Austria.
His devotion to her was doubled when he beheld her agony in giving him a
son. He had always shown a fondness for children; his law code gave them
especial protection; 60 now the infant King of Rome became the idol and
bearer of his hopes, carefully trained to inherit and wisely rule a
France giv- ing laws to a united Europe. So the great ego enlarged
itself with marital and parental love.</p>
<p>He was too immersed in politics to have time for friends; besides,
friend- ship implies a near-equality of give and take, and Napoleon
found it hard to concede equality in any form. He had faithful servitors
and devotees, some of whom gave their lives for his glory and their own;
yet none would have thought of calling him a friend. Eugene loved him,
but as a son rather than a friend. Bourrienne (never quite trustworthy)
relates that in 1800 he often heard Napoleon say:</p>
<p>“Friendship is but a name. I love nobody. I do not even love my
brothers. Perhaps Joseph a little, from habit and because he is my
elder; and Duroc,* I love him too…. I know very well that I have no true
friends. As long as I continue what I am, I may have as many pretended
friends as I please. Leave sensibility to women; it is their business.
But men should be firm at heart and in purpose, or they should have
nothing to do with war or government.” 61</p>
<p>This has the stoic Napoleonic ring, but is not easily reconciled with
the lifelong devotion of men like Desaix, Duroc, Lannes, Las Cases, and
a host of others. The same Bourrienne attests that “out of the field of
battle Bona - parte had a kind and feeling heart.” 62 And Meneval, close
to Napoleon for thirteen years, agrees:</p>
<p>I had expected to find him brusque and of uncertain temper, instead
of which I found him patient, indulgent, easy to please, by no means
exacting, merry with a merriness which was often noisy and mocking, and
sometimes of a charming bonhomie…. I was no longer afraid of him. I was
maintained in this state of mind by all that I saw of his pleasant and
affectionate ways with Josephine, the assiduous devotion of his
officers, the kindliness of his relations with the consuls and the
ministers, and his familiarity with the soldiers. 63</p>
<p>Apparently he could be hard when he thought that policy demanded it,
and lenient when policy allowed; policy had to come first. He sent many
men to jail, and yet a hundred instances of his kindness are recorded,
as ih&lt; the volumes of Frederic Masson. He took action to improve
conditions in the jails of Brussels, but conditions in French prisons in
1814 were unworthy</p>

<p>CHAP. X) NAPOLEONHIMSELF 245</p>
<p>of the general efficiency of his rule. He saw thousands of men dead
on the field of battle, and went on to other battles; yet we hear of his
often stop- ping to comfort or relieve a wounded soldier. Very Constant
“saw him weep while eating his breakfast after coming from the bedside
of Marshal Lannes,” 64 mortally wounded at Essling in 1 809.</p>
<p>There is no question about his generosity, nor about his readiness to
for- give. He repeatedly — and once too often — forgave Bernadotte and
Bour- rienne. When Carnot and Chenier, after years of opposition to
Napoleon, appealed to him to relieve their poverty, he sent help
immediately. At St. Helena he contrived excuses for those who had
deserted him in 1813 or</p>
<ol start="1815" type="1">
<li>Only the British won his lasting resentment of their lasting enmity;
he saw nothing but mercenary hardness in Pitt, was rather unfair to Sir
Hudson Lowe, and found it impossible to appreciate Wellington. 65 There
was a con- siderable justice in his self- estimate: “I consider myself a
good man at heart.” 66 No man, we are told, is a hero to his valet; but
Very Constant, Na - poleon’s valet through fourteen years, recorded his
memories in numerous volumes “breathless with adoration.” 67</li>
</ol>
<p>Persons brought up to the elegant manners of the Old Regime could not
bear the blunt directness of Napoleon’s style of movement and address.
He amused such people by the awkward consciousness of his carriage and
the occasional coarseness of his speech. He did not know how to put
others at their ease, and did not seem to care; he was too eager for the
substance to fret about the form. “I do not like that vague and leveling
phrase les con - venances [the proprieties]…. It is a device of fools to
raise themselves to the level of people of intellect…. ‘Good taste’ is
another of those classical expressions which mean nothing to me…. What
is called ‘style,’ good or bad, does not affect me. I care only for the
force of the thought.” 68 Secretly, however, he admired the easy grace
and quiet considerateness of the gentle- man; he longed to win approval
from the aristocrats who made fun of him in the salons of Faubourg St.-
Germain. In his own way he could be “fasci - nating when he chose to
be.” 6 ®</p>
<p>His low opinion of women may have been due to his hurried
carelessness of their sensitivity. So he remarked to Mme. Charpentier,
“How ill you look in that red dress!” 70 — and he turned Mme. de Stael
to enmity by rank- ing women according to their fertility. Some women
rebuked his rudeness with feminine subtlety. When he exclaimed to Mme.
de Chevreuse, “Dear me, how red your hair is!” she answered, “Perhaps it
is, Sire, but this is the first time a man has ever told me so.” 71 When
he told a famous beauty, “Madame, I do not like it when women mix in
politics,” she retorted, “You are right, General; but in a country where
they have their heads cut off, it is natural that they should wa nt to
know why.” 72 Nevertheless Meneval, who saw him almost daily, noted
“that winning charm which was so irresisti - ble in Napoleon.” 73</p>
<p>He liked to talk — sometimes garrulously, almost always usefully and
to the point. He invited scientists, artists, actors, writers, to his
table, and sur- prised them by his affability, his knowledge of their
field, and the aptness</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xof his remarks. Isabey the miniaturist, Monge the mathematician,
Fontaine the architect, and Talma the actor left reminiscences of these
meetings, all testifying to the “grace, amiability, and gaiety” of
Napoleon’s conversa - tion. 74 He much preferred talking to writing. His
ideas advanced faster than his speeches; when he tried to write them
down he wrote so rapidly that no one — not he himself — could then
decipher his scrawl. 75 So he dictated, and as 41,000 of his letters
have been published, and doubtless other thousands were written, we can
begin to understand how the honor of being his secretary was a sentence
to hard labor. Bourrienne, who took the post in 1797, had the good
fortune to be dismissed in 1802, and so survived till 1834. He was ex-
pected to join Napoleon at 7 a.m., work all day, and be on call at
night. He could speak and write several languages, knew international
law, and, with his own method of shorthand, could usually write as fast
as Napoleon dic- tated.</p>
<p>Meneval, who succeeded Bourrienne in 1802, la bored still harder, for
“I did not know any kind of shorthand.” Napoleon was fond of him, often
jested with him, but wore him out almost daily, after which he would
tell him to go and take a bath. 76 At St. Helena the Emperor recalled:
“I nearly killed poor Meneval; I was obliged to relieve him for a while
from the duties of his situation, and place him, for the recovery of his
health, near the per- son of Marie Louise, where his post was a mere
sinecure.” 77 In 1806 Napo - leon authorized him to engage an assistant,
Francois Fain, who served to the end, and on all campaigns. Even so
Meneval was quite worn out when he escaped from his fond despot in 1813.
It was one of those love affairs that thrive on inequality recognized
and not abused.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GENERAL</li>
</ol>
<p>His body and mind, character, and career were in part molded by his
military education at Brienne. There he learned to keep himself fit in
any weather or place; to think clearly at any hour of day or night; to
distinguish fact from desire; to obey without question as training for
commanding without hesitation; to see terrains as possibilities for the
open or hidden movement of masses of men; to anticipate enemy maneuvers
and prepare to counter them; to expect the unexpected and meet it
unsurprised; to inspire individual souls by addressing them en masse; to
anesthetize pain with glory, and make it sweet and noble to die for
one’s country: all this appeared to Napoleon as the science o f
sciences, since a nation’s life depends— other means having failed —
upon its willingness and ability to defend itself in the final
arbitrament of war. “The art of war,” he declared, “is an immense study,
which comprises all others.” 78</p>
<p>So he cultivated most those sciences that would contribute most to
the science of national defense. He read history to learn the nature of
man and the behavior of states; he surprised the savants, later, by his
knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome, of medieval and m odern Europe. He
“studied and</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>2 47</p>
<p>restudied” the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus
Adol - phus, Turenne, Eugene of Sandandandandvoy, and Frederick the
Great; “model your - self on them,” he told his officers, “reject every
maxim contrary to those of these great men.” 79</p>
<p>From the military academy he passed to the camp, and from the camp to
control of a regiment. Perhaps from his stoic mother he had the gift of
com- mand, and knew its secret: that most persons would rather follow a
lead than give it — if the leader leads. He had the courage to take
responsibility, to stake his career again and again upon his judgment;
and, with a daring that too often laughed at caution, he passed from one
gamble to another — ever play- ing with more human pawns for higher
stakes. He lost the last wager, but only after proving himself the
ablest general in history.</p>
<p>His military strategy began with measures for winning the minds and
hearts of his men. He interested himself in the background, character,
and hopes of each officer directly under his command. He mingled now and
then with the common soldiers, recalling their victories, inquiring
about their families, and listening to their complaints. He
good-humoredly rallied his Imperial Guard, and called them u les
grogneurs ” because they grumbled so much; but they fought for him to
the last death. Sometimes he spoke cyni- cally of the simple
infantryman, as when, at St. Helena, he remarked that “troops are made
to let themselves be killed”; 80 but he adopted, and pro - vided for,
all the children of the French warriors who died at Austerlitz. 81 More
than any other section of the French nation his soldiers loved him — so
much so t hat, in Wellington’s judgment, his presence on the battlefield
was worth forty thousand men. 82</p>
<p>His addresses to his army were an important part of his strategy. “In
war,” he said, “morale and opinion are more than half the battle.” 83 No
other gen - eral since Caesar at the Rubicon had ever exercised such
fascination over his men. Bourrienne, who wrote some of those famous
proclamations at Napo- leon’s dictation, tells us that the troops in
many cases “could not understand what Napoleon said, but no matter, they
would have followed him cheer- fully barefoot and without provisions.”
84 In several of his addresses he ex - plained to them his plan of
operations; usually they understood, and bore more patiently the long
marches that enabled them to surprise or outnumber the foe. “The best
soldier,” he said, “is not so much the one who fights as the one who
marches.” 85 In a proclamation of 1799 he told his auditors: “The chief
virtues of a soldier are constancy and discipline. Valor comes only in t
he second place.” 86 He often showed mercy, but he did not hesitate</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XNapoleon expressed part of his strategy in a mathematical formula:
“The strength of an army, like the amount of momentum in mechanics, is
esti- mated by the mass times the velocity. A swift march enhances the
morale of an army, and increases its power for victory.” 88 There is no
authority for ascribing to him the aphorism that “an army travels on its
stomach”— that is, on its food supply; 89 his view was rather that it
wins with its feet. His motto was “ Activite , activite, vitesse ” 00 —
action and speed. Consequently he placed no reliance on fortresses as
defenses; he would have laughed at the Maginot Line of 1939. “It is
axiomatic,” he had said, far back in 1793, “that the side which remains
behind its fortified line is always defeated”; and he repeated</p>
<p>The final test of the general is in tactics — the disposition and
maneuvering of his forces for and during battle. Napoleon took his stand
where he could survey as much of the action as his safety would allow;
and since the plan of operations, and its quick adjustment to the turn
of events, depended upon his continued and concentrated attention, his
safety was a prime considera- tion, even more in the judgment of his
troops than in his actual practice; if he thought it necessary, as at
Arcole, he did not hesitate to expose himself; and more than once we
read of men being killed at his side in his place of observation. From
such a point, through a staff of mounted orderlies, he dispatched
instructions to the commanding officers in the infantry, the ar-
tillery, and the cavalry; and those messengers hurried back to keep him
in- formed of the turn of events in every segment of the action. In
battle, he believed, soldiers acquired their value chiefly through their
position and maneuverability. Here too the aim was concentration — of
massed men and heavy fire upon a particular point, preferably a flank,
of the enemy, in the. hope of throwing that part into a disorder that
would spread. “In all battles a moment comes when the bravest troops,
after having made the greatest efforts, feel inclined to run…. Two
armies are two bodies that meet and endeavor to frighten each other; a
moment of panic occurs, and that moment must be turned to advantage.
When a man has been present in many actions, he distinguishes that
moment without difficulty.” 92 Napoleon was especially quick to take
advantage of such a development,, or, if his own men wavered, to send
reinforcements, or change his line of operation in the course of a
battle; this saved the day for him at Marengo.. Retreat was not in his
vo- cabulary before 1812.</p>
<p>It was natural that one who had developed such skill in generalship
should come to find a macabre thrill in war. We have heard him lauding
civilians as above soldiers; he gave precedence, at his court, to the
statesmen over the</p>
<p>CHAP. X) NAPOLEON HIMSELF 249</p>
<p>marshals; and when conflicts arose between the civilian populations
and the military he regularly took the civilian side. 93 But he could
not conceal from himself or others that he experienced on the
battlefield a pleasure keener than any that came from administration.
“There is a joy in danger,” he said, and he confessed to Jo mini that he
“loved the excitement of battle”; 94 he was happiest when he saw masses
of men moving at his will into actions that changed the map and decided
history. He viewed his campaigns as responses to attacks, but he
admitted, according to Bourrien ne, “My power depends upon my glory, and
my glory on my victories. My power would fall were I not to support it
by new glory and new victories. Conquest has made me what I am, and
conquest alone can maintain me.” 95 We cannot quite trust the hostile
Bourrienne for this pivotal confession; but Las Cases, to whom Napoleon
was next to God, quoted him as saying (March 12, 1816), “I wished for
the empire of the world, and, to ensure it, unlimited power was
necessary to me.” 96</p>
<p>Was he, as his enemies put it, “a butcher”? We are told that he
recruited a total of 2,613,000 Frenchmen for his armies; 97 of these
about one million died in his service. 98 Was he disturbed by the
slaughter? He mentioned it in his appeals to the Powers for peace; and
we are told that the sight of the corpses at Eylau moved him to tears.
99 Yet, when it was all over, and he looked at the matter in retrospect,
he told Las Cases: “I had commanded in battles that were to decide the
fate of a whole army, and I had felt no emo- tion. I had watched the
execution of maneuvers that were bound to cost the lives of many among
us, and my eyes had remained dry.” 100 Presumably a general must comfort
himself with the thought that the premature deaths of those uprooted
youths were insignificant displacements in space and time; would they
not have come to an end anyway, obscurely, less gloriously, without the
anesthesia of battle and the amends of fame?</p>
<p>Even so, he felt, as many scholars (Ranke, Sorel, Vandal…) felt, that
he had been more sinned against than sinning; that he had fought and
killed in self- defense; that the Allies had vowed to depose him as the
“Son of the Revolution” and the usurper of a Bourbon throne. Had he not
repeatedly proposed peace and been repuls ed? “I only conquered in my
own defense. Europe never ceased to war against France, against her
principles, and against myself. The Coalition never ceased to exist,
either secretly or openly.” 101 He had taken, at his coronation, an oath
to preserve the “natural boundaries” of France; what would France have
said if he had surrendered them? “The vulgar have never ceased blaming
all my wars on my ambition. But were they of my choosing? Were they not
always determined by the ineluctable nature of things? — by the struggle
between the past and the future?” 102 He was always weighed down, after
the exuberant first years, by the feeling that no matter how many
victories he might win, one decisive defeat would wipe them out and
leave him at the mercy of his foes. He would have given half the world
for peace, but on hi»own terms.</p>
<p>We may conclude that until Tilsit (1807) and the invasion of
Spain</p>
<p>(1808), Napoleon was on the defensive, and that thereafter, in the
attempt</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xo subjugate Austria, then Prussia, then Spain, then Russia, and to
enforce his Continental Blockade, he brought additional wars upon an
exhausted France and a resentful Europe. Though he had proved himself a
superlative administrator, he abandoned the cares of state for the glory
and ecstasy of war. He had won France as a general, and as a general he
lost it. His forte became his fate.</p>
<p>V. THE RULER</p>
<p>As a civilian ruler he never quite forgot that he had been trained as
a gen- eral. The habits of leadership remained, discouraging, except in
the Council of State, objection or debate. “From my first entrance into
[public] life I was accustomed to exercise command; circumstances and
the force of my character were such that as soon as I possessed power I
acknowledged no master and obeyed no laws except those of my own
creating.” 103 We have seen him, in 1 800, emphasizing the civilian form
of his rule — when the gen- erals were plotting to depose him; but in
1816 he argued that “in the l ast analysis, in order to govern, it is
necessary to be a military man; one can rule only in boots and spurs.”
104 So, with a sharp eye to the secret and con - tradictory ideals of
the French people, he declared himself a man of peace and a genius of
war. Hence the relative democracy of the Consulate melted into the
monarchy of the Empire, and finally into absolute power. The last of the
Napoleonic codes — the penal (1810) — is a reversion to the barbaric
severity of medieval penalties. Nevertheless he became almost as
brilliant in government as in battle. He predicted that his achievements
in administration would outshine his martial victories in human memory,
and that his codes were a monument more lasting than his strategy and
tactics (which are irrelevant to current war). He longed to be the
Justinian as well as the Caesar Augustus of his age.</p>
<p>In the 3,680 days of his imperial rule (1804-14) he was in Paris for
only 95 5, 105 but in these he remade France. When at home, and before
1808, he presided regularly, twice a week, over the Council of State;
and then, said Las Cases (himself a member), “none of us would have been
absent for the whole world.” 106 He worked hard; in his eagerness to get
things done he sometimes rose at 3 a.m. to begin his working day. He
expected almost as much from his administrative aides. They were always
to be ready to give him precise up-to-the-hour information on any matter
falling within their jurisdiction; and he judged them by the accuracy,
order, readiness, and ade- quacy of their reports. He did not consider
his day finished until he had read the memoranda and documents that
almost daily came to him from the vari- ous departments of his
government. He was probably the best-informed ruler in history.</p>
<p>For major ministries he chose men of first-rate ability, like
Talleyrand, Gaudin, and Fouche, despite their troublesome pride; for the
rest, and gen- erally for administrative posts, he preferred men of the
second rank, who</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>2 5 I</p>
<p>would not ask questions or propose measures of their own; he had no
time or patience for such discussions; he would take a chance on his own
judg- ment, assuming the responsibility and risk. He required of his
appointees an oath of fidelity, not only to France but to himself; in
most cases they readily agreed, feeling the mesmerism of his personality
and the grandeur of his designs. “I aroused emu lation, rewarded every
merit, and pushed back the limits of glory.” 107 He paid for his method
of selecting aides by gradually</p>
<p>He was severe on his subordinates: stern to reprove and slow to
praise, but ready to reward exceptional service. He did not believe in
putting them confidently at their ease; some uncertainty of tenure would
encourage dili- gence. He did not necessarily object to their liaisons,
nor even to some shady elements in their past, for these gave him a hold
on their good be- havior. 108 He used his assistants to the limit, then
let them retire with a gen- erous pension, and perhaps some sudden title
of nobility. Some of them did not survive to that denouement;
Villeneuve, defeated at Trafalgar, killed himself rather than face
reproof. Napoleon was not long moved by protests against his severity.
“A statesman’s heart must be in his head”; 109 he must not let sentiment
interfere with policy; in the operation of an empire the individual
counts for little — unless he is a Napoleon. Perhaps he exaggerated</p>
<p>wicked,” 111 said the Emperor. “Joseph,” he mourned, “is too good to
be a great man”; but he loved him.</p>
<p>Akin to these views — learned in Corsica and war — was his
oft-repeated opinion that men are moved, and can be ruled, only by
interest or fear. 112 So, year by year, these feelings became the levers
of his government. In 1800, sending General Hedouville to suppress a
rising in the Vendee, he ad- vised him, “as a salutary example, to burn
down two or three lar ge com- munes [towns], chosen among those whose
conduct is worst. Experience has taught him [the First Consul] that a
spectacularly severe act is, in the conditions you are facing, the most
humane method. Only weakness is in- human.” 113 He instructed his
judicial appointees to pass severe sentences. “The art of the police,”
he told Fouche, “consists in punishing rarely and severely.” 114 He not
only employed a large force of police and detectives</p>
<p>252 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xwhose duty it was to help — and spy on — Fouche and Regnier, and to
report to the Emperor any anti-Napoleonic sentiments expressed in the
newspapers, the theater, the salons, or in books. “A prince,” he said,
“should suspect everything.” 115 By 1804 France was a police state. By
1810 it had a new supply of minor Bastilles — state prisons in which
political offenders could be “detained” by imper ial order, without a
regular procedure in the courts. 116 We should note, however, that the
Emperor had moments of mercy. Fie issued many pardons, even to those who
had plotted to kill him, 117 and some- times he reduced the severity of
a court penalty. 118 To Caulaincourt, in De- cember, 1 8 1 2, he
mused:</p>
<p>“They think I am stern, even hardhearted. So much the better— this
makes it unnecessary for me to justify my reputation. My firmness is
taken for cal- lousness. I shall not complain, since this notion is
responsible for the good order that is prevailing…. Look here,
Caulaincourt, I am human. No matter what some people say, I too have
entrails [‘bowels of mercy’] , a heart— but the heart of a sovereign. I
am not moved by the tears of a duchess, but the suffer- ings of the
people touch me.” 119</p>
<p>Unquestionably he was a despot, often enlightened, often hastily
absolute. He confessed to Las Cases, “The state was myself.” 120
Something of his tyranny might be excused as the usual control, by the
government, of a nation’s economy, theaters, and publications in time of
war. Napoleon ex - plained his omnipotence as necessary in the difficult
transition from the licentious liberty of the Revolution after 1791 to
the reconstructive order of the Consulate and the Empire. He recalled
that Robespierre, as well as Marat, had recommended a dictatorship as
needed to restore order and sta- bility to a France verging on the
dissolution of both the family and the state. He felt that he had not
destroyed democracy; what he had replaced in 1799 was an oligarchy of
corrupt, merciless, and unscrupulous men. He had destroyed the liberty
of the masses, but that liberty was destroying France with mob violence
and moral license, and only the restoration and concentration of
authority could restore the strength of France as a civi- lized and
independent state.</p>
<p>Until 1810 Napoleon could forgivably feel that he had been true to
the Revolution’s second goal— equality. He had upheld and spread the
equality of all before the law. He had established not an impossible
equality of abili- ties and merits, but an equality of opportunity for
all talents, wherever born, to develop themselves in a society offering
education, economic opportunity, and political eligibility to all;
perhaps this carrier e ouverte aux talents was his most lasting gift to
France. He almost ended corruption in public life; 121 this alone should
immortalize him. He gave to all the example of a man using himself up in
administration when not called to the battlefield. He remade France.</p>
<p>Why did he fail? Because his grasp exceeded his reach, his
imagination dominated his ambition, and his ambition domineered over his
body, mind, and character. He should have known that the Powers would
never be con- tent to have France rule half of Europe. He succeeded
measurably in leading</p>

<p>253</p>
<p>Rhineland Germany out of feudalism into the nineteenth century, but
it was beyond him, or any man at that time, to bring into a lasting
federation an area long since partitioned into states each with its
jealous traditions, dialect, manners, creed, and government. Just to
name those diverse realms, from the Rhine to the Vistula, from Brussels
to Naples, is to feel the problem: kingdoms or principalities like
Holland, Hanover, Westphalia, the Hanseatic: cities, Baden, Bavaria,
Wiirttemberg, Illyria, Venice, Lombardy, the Papal States, the Two
Sicilies — where could he find men strong enough to rule these areas, to
tax them, finally to take their sons to war against nations more akin to
them than the French? How could he forge a unity between those
forty-four additional departments and the eighty-six of France, or
between those proud and sturdy 16 million added people and these proud
and volatile 26 million Frenchmen? Perhaps it was magnificent to try,
but it was certain to fail. In the end imagination toppled reason; the
polyglot colos- sus, standing on one unsteady head, tumbled back into
difference, and the rooted force of national character defeated the
great dictator’s will to power.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE PHILOSOPHER</li>
</ol>
<p>And yet, when imagination folded its wings, he could reason with the
ablest of the savants in the French and Egyptian Institutes. Though he
con- trived no formal system of thought in which to imprison a universe
that seemed to escape every formula, his realistic mind’ made short work
of “ideologues” who mistook ideas for facts and built airy castles
without foundations in biology and history. After trying Laplace and
other scientists in administrative posts he concluded, “You can’t do
anything with a philoso - pher.” 122 However, he encouraged the
sciences, and recommen ded history. “My son should study much history,
and meditate upon it,” he said at St. Helena, “for it is the only true
philosophy.” 123</p>
<p>Religion was one of the fields in which the ideologues had floated on
a film of notions instead of grounding themselves in history. Only a
logician, Napoleon felt, would bother long with the question, Does God
exist? The real philosopher, schooled in history, would ask, why has
religion, so often refuted and ridiculed, always survived, and played so
notable a role in every civilization? Why did the skeptic Voltaire say
that if God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him?</p>
<p>Napoleon himself lost his religious faith at the early age of
thirteen. Some- times he wished he had kept it; “I imagine it must give
great and true hap- piness.” 124 Everyone knows the story how, on the
trip to Egypt, hearing some scientists discourse irreverently, he
challenged them, pointing to the stars, “You may talk as long as you
please, gentlemen, but who made all that?” 125 It is possible to quote
him pro and con on this and many other sub^ jects, for he changed his
views and moods with time, and we tend to ignore their dates; yet what
thoughtful person has not at fifty discarded the dogmas he swore by in
his yo uth, and will not at eighty smile at the “mature” views</p>
<p>2 54</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xof his middle age? Generally Napoleon retained belief in an
intelligence be- hind or in the physical world , 126 but he disclaimed
any knowledge of its character or purpose. “Everything proclaims the
existence of a God,” he concluded at St. Helena , 127 but “to say whence
I came, what I am, or where I am going is above my comprehension.” 128
At times he spoke like a material - istic evolutionist: “Eve rything is
matter ; 129… man is only a more perfect and better reasoning animal.”
130 “The soul is not immortal; if it were it would have existed before
our birth.” 131 “If I had to have a religion, I should adore the sun,
for it is the sun that fertilizes everything; it is the true god of the
earth.” 132 “I should believe in religion if i’c had existed since the
beginning of the world. But when I read Socrates, Plato, Moses, or
Mohammed, I have no more belief. It has all been invented by men.”
133</p>
<p>But why did they invent it? To comfort the poor, Napoleon answered,
and to keep them from killing the rich. For all men are born unequal,
and become more unequal with every advancement in technology and
specializa- tion; a civilization must elicit, develop, use, and reward
superior abilities, and it must persuade the less fortunate to accept
peaceably this inequality of re- wards and possessions as natural and
necessary. How can this be done? By teaching men that it is the will of
God. “I do not see in religion the mystery of the Incarnation but the
mystery of the social order. Society cannot exist without inequality of
[rewards and therefore] property, an inequality which cannot be
maintained without religion…. It must be possible to tell the poor: ‘It
is God’s will. There must be rich and poor in this world, but here -
after, and for eternity, there will be a different distribution.’” 134
“Religion introduces into the thought of heaven an idea of equalization
which saves the rich from being massacred by the poor.” 135</p>
<p>If all this be true, it was a mistake of the Enlightenment to attack
Chris- tianity, and of the Revolution to make Catholic preaching
difficult. “The intellectual [moral?] anarchy which we are undergoing is
the result of the moral [intellectual?] anarchy — the extinction of
faith, the negation of prin- ciples [beliefs] which have preceded.” 136
Perhaps for this reason, and for political use, Napoleon restored the
Catholic Church as th e “sacred gen - darmerie [police] of the French
nation.”* He did not interpret the new alliance as binding him to the
Ten Commandments; he wandered from them now and then, but he paid the
priests to preach them to a generation weary of chaos and ready for a
return to order and discipline. Most parents and teachers were glad to
have the help of religious faith in rearing or training children — to
counter the natural anarchism of youth with a moral code based upon
religious and filial piety, and presented as coming from an omnipotent
God watchful of every act, threatening eternal punishments, and offering
eternal rewards. Most of the governing class were grateful for an educa-
tional process that would produce a public taught to accept, as natural
and inevitable, the inequality of abilities and possessions. The old
aristocracy was excused as cleansing its wealth with manners «nd grace;
a new aristocracy</p>
<p>So the Concordat was explained by Louis Bignon, wh o was designated
by Napoleon’s will to write the history of Napoleon’s diplomacy. 137</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>2 55</p>
<p>was established; and revolution, for a generation, muted its voice
and hid its guns.</p>
<p>In this regenerated society marriage and motherhood had to be
resancti- fied, and property, not romantic love, had to be restored as
their base and goal. Love generated by the physical attraction of boy
and girl is an acci- dent of hormones and propinquity; to found a
lasting marriage upon such a haphazard and transitory condition is
ridiculous; it is une sottise faite a deux —“a folly committed in pair.”
138 Much of it is artificially induced by roman - tic literature; it
would probably disappear if men were illiterate. “I firmly believe that
[romantic] love does more harm than good, and that it would be a
blessing… if it were banished” as a reason for uniting a man and a woman
in the lifelong enterprise of rearing children and acquiring and trans-
mitting property. “Marriage should be forbidden to individuals who have
known each other less than six months.” 139</p>
<p>Napoleon had a Mohammedan view of marriage: its function is to pro-
duce abundant offspring under conditions of freedom for the man and pro-
tection for the faithful and obedient wife. The marriage ceremony,
though it may be civil, should be ceremonious and solemn, as emphasizing
the obli- gation undertaken. 140 The married couple should sleep
together; this “exerts a singular influence upon married life,
guarantees the position of the wife and the dependence of the husband,
and preserves intimacy and morality”; 141 Napoleon followed this old
custom until he set his mind upon divorce.</p>
<p>However, even a faithful wife is not enough for a man. “I find it
ridicu - lous that a man should not be able to have more than one
legitimate wife. When she is pregnant it is as if the man had no wife at
all.” 142 Polygyny is better than divorce or adultery. There should be
no divorce after ten years of marriage. A woman should be permitted only
one divorce, and should not be allowed to remarry for five years
afterward. 143 Adultery on the hus- band’s part should not be sufficient
ground for a divorce, unless there is the additional circumstance of the
husband’s keepin g his concubine under the same roof with his wife. 144
“When a husband commits an act of unfaithful - ness to his wife, he
should confess it to her and regret his action; then every trace of
guilt is wiped away. The wife is angry, forgives, and is reconciled to
him; often she even gains through it. But that is not the case with the
unfaithfulness of the wife. It is all very well for her to confess and
regret, but who knows whether something else remains” in her mind or
womb? “Therefore she must not, and cannot ever come to an understanding
with him.” 145 (But he had twice forgiven Josephine.)</p>
<p>He guarded himself against feminine charms by adhering to the Moham-
medan view of wo men. “We treat women too well, and in this way have
spoiled everything. We have done every wrong in raising them to our
level. Truly the Oriental nations have more mind and sense than we in
declaring the wife to be the actual property of the husband. In fact
nature has made woman our slave…. Woman is given to man that she may
bear him chil- dren;… consequently she is his property, just as the
fruit tree is the prop- erty of the gardener.” 146</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>X2 5 6</p>
<p>All this is so primitive (and so contrary to biology, where the
female usually is the predominant sex, and the male is a tributary
food-provider, sometimes himself eaten) that we should be glad to accept
Las Cases’ assur - ance that much of it was playful bravado, or the
military man’s dream of endless conscripts pouring from fertile wombs;
but it was quite in harmony with the views of any Corsican condottiere.
The Code Napoleon insisted on the absolute power of the husband over his
wife, and over her property, as a necessity of social order. “I have
always thought,” Napoleon wrote to Josephine in 1807, “that woman was
made for man, and man for country, family, glory, and honor.” 147 On the
day after the mutual massacre known as the battle of Friedland (June 14,
1807) Napoleon drew up a program for a school to be built at Lcouen “for
girls who have lost their mothers, and whose people are too poor to
bring them up properly.”</p>
<p>What are the girls at Ecouen to be taught? You must begin with
religion in all its strictness…. What we ask of education is not that
girls should think, but that they should believe. The weakness of
women’s brains, the instability of their ideas,…. their need for
perpetual resignation… all this can be met only by religion… I want the
place to produce not women of charm but women of virtue; they must be
attractive because they have high principles and warm hearts,.not
because they are witty or amusing…. In addition the girls must be taught
writing, arithmetic, and elementary French;… a little history and
geography;… not Latin… They must learn to do all kinds of women’s work….
With the single exception of the headmaster, all men must be ex- cluded
from the school… Even the gardening must be done by women. 148</p>
<p>Napoleon’s political philosophy was equally uncompromising. Since all
men are born unequal, it is inevitable that the majority of brains will
be in ,a minority of men, who will rule the majority with guns or words.
Hence utopias of equality are the consolatory myths of the weak;
anarchist cries for freedom from laws and government are the delusions
of immature and autocratic minds; and democracy is a game used by the
strong to conceal their oligarchic rule. 149 Actually France had had to
choose between an hereditary nobility and rule by the business class.
So, “among nations and in revolutions, aristocracy always exists. If you
attempt to get rid of it by destroying the nobility, it immediately
reestablishes itself among the rich and powerful families of the Third
Estate. Destroy it there, and it survives and takes refuge among the
leaders of workmen and of the people.” 150 “De - mocracy, if reasonable,
would limit itself to giving everyone an equal oppor- tunity to compete
and obtain.” 151 Napoleon claimed to have done this by making la
carriere ouverte aux talents in all fields; but he allowed many devi-
ations from this rule.</p>
<p>He was a bit equivocal about revolutions. They release the violent
pas- sions of the mob, since “collective crimes incriminate no one,” 152
and there is “never a revolution without a terror.” 153 “Revolutions are
the true cause of regeneration in public customs,” 154 but in general
(he concluded in 1816) “a revolution is one of the greatest evils by
which mankind can be visited. It is</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>2 57</p>
<p>he scourge of the generation by which it is brought about; and all
the ad- vantages which it procures cannot make amends for the misery
with which it embitters the lives of those who take part in it.” 165</p>
<p>He preferred monarchy to all other forms of government, even to
defend- ing hereditary kingship (i.e., his own) against doubts expressed
by Czar Alexander. 156 “There are more chances of securing a good
sovereign by heredity than by election.” 157 People are happier under
such a stable govern - ment than under a free-for-all, devil-take-the-
hindmost democracy. “In regular and tranquil times every individual has
his share of felicity: the cob- bler in his stall is as content as the
king on his throne; the soldier is no less happy than the general.”
158</p>
<p>His political ideal was a federation of European, or Continental,
states, governed in their external relations from Paris as the “capital
of the world.” In that “Association Europeenne” all the component states
would have the same money, weights, measures, and basic laws, with no
political barriers to travel, transport, and trade. 159 When Napoleon
reached Moscow in 1812 he thought that only a just peace with Alexander
remained in the way of realizing his dream. He had underestimated the
centrifugal power of national differences; but he may have been right in
believing that if Europe achieved unity it would be not through appeals
to reason but through the imposition of a superior force continuing
through a generation. War would then con- tinue, but at least it would
be civil.</p>
<p>As he approached his end he wondered whether he had been a free and
creative agent or the helpless instrument of some cosmic force. He was
not a fatalist, if this means one who believes that his success or
failure, his health or illness, the character of his life and the moment
of his death, have been de- termined by some hidden power, regardless of
what he chooses to do; 160 nor was he clearly a determinist in the sense
of one who believes that every oc- currence, including his every choice,
idea, or act, is determined by the com- position of all the forces and
history of the past. But he repeatedly talked of a “destiny”— a central
stream of events, partly malleable by the human will, but basically
irresistible as flowing from the inherent nature of things. At times he
spoke of his will as strong enough to stem or bend the current — “1 have
always been able to impose my will upon destiny.” 161 Too uncertain to
be consistent, he also said: “I depend upon events. I have no will; I
await all things from their issue” 162 — as they issue from their
source. “The greater one is”— i.e., the higher he is in authority — “the
less free will one can have”— the more and stronger will be the forces
impinging upon him. “One depends upon circumstances and events. I am the
greatest slave among men; my mas- ter is the nature of things.” 163 He
combined his fluctuating moods in the proud conception of himself as an
instrument of destiny — i.e., the nature of things as determining the co
urse and terminus of events. “Destiny urges me to a goal of which I am
ignorant. Until that goal is reached I am invulner- able, unassailable”—
as borne with the stream. “When destiny has accom - plished its purpose
in me, a fly may suffice to destroy me.” 164 He felt himself</p>
<p>258 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xbound to a destiny magnificent but perilous; pride and circumstance
drove him on; “destiny must be fulfilled.” 165</p>
<p>Like all of us he frequently thought of death, and had moods
defending or contemplating suicide. In youth he felt that suicide was
the final right of every soul; at fifty- one he added: “if his death
harms no one.” 166 He had no faith in immortality. “There is no
immortality but the memory that is left in the minds of men…. To have
lived without glory, without leaving a trace of one’s existence, is not
to have lived at all.” 167</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>WHAT WAS HE?</li>
</ol>
<p>Was he a Frenchman? Only by the accident of time; otherwise he was
French neither in body nor in mind nor in character. He was short, and
later stout; his features were stern Roman rather than brightly Gallic;
he lacked the gaiety and grace, the humor and wit, the refinement and
manners of a cultured Frenchman; he was bent on dominating the world
rather than enjoying it. He had some difficulty in speaking French; he
retained a foreign accent till 1807; 168 he spoke Italian readily, and
seemed more at home in Milan than in Paris. On several occasions he
expressed dislike of the French character. “The Emperor,” reported Las
Cases, “dilated upon our volatile, fickle, and changeable disposition.
‘All the French,’ he said, ‘are turbulent, and inclined to rail…. France
loves change too much for any government to endure there.’” 169</p>
<p>He spoke often — with the emphasis of one not sure — of his love for
France. He resented being called “the Corsican”; “I wanted to be
absolutely</p>
<p>French”; 170 “the noblest title in the world is that of having been
born a Frenchman.” 171 But in 1809 he revealed to Roederer what he meant
by his love of France: “I have but one passion, one mistress, and that
is France. I sleep with her. She has never been false to me. She
lavishes her blood and treasure on me. If I need 50 0,000 men she gives
them to me.” 172 He loved her as a violinist can love his violin, as an
instrument of immediate response to his stroke and will. He drew the
strings of this instrument taut until they snapped, nearly all of them
at once.</p>
<p>Was he the “Son of the Revolution”? So the Allies sometimes called
him; but by this they meant that he had inherited the guilt of the
Revolution’s crimes, and had continued its repudiation of the Bourbons.
He himself re- peatedly said that he had brought the Revolution to an
end — not only its chaos and violence but its pretenses to democracy. He
was the Son of the Revolution insofar as he retained peasant
emancipation, free enterprise, equality before the law, career open to
talent, and the will to defend the natural frontiers. But when he made
himself consul for life, then emperor, when he ended freedom of speech
and the press, made the Catholic Church a partner in the government,
used new Bastilles, and favored aristocracy old and new — then, surely,
he ceased to be the Son of the Revolution. In many ways he remained so
in the conquered lands; there he ended feudalism, the</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>NAPOLEON HIMSELF</p>
<p>2 59</p>
<p>Inquisition, and priestly control of life; there he brought in his
Code and some rays of the Enlightenment. But, having so dowered these
states, he gave them kings.</p>
<p>Was he rightly, despite his will, called “the Corsican”? Only in his
family loyalty, his flair for combat, his passionate defense of France
against its foes; but he lacked the Corsican spirit of feud, and his
reading of the philosophes far removed him from the medieval Catholicism
of his native isle. He was Corsican in blood, French in education, and
Italian in almost everything else.</p>
<p>Yes, after all attempts to answer them, we must go back to Stendhal
and Taine, and say that Napoleon was a condottiere of the Italian
Renaissance, preserved in mold and type by the isolation, feuds, and
wars of Corsica. He was Cesare Borgia with twice the brains, and
Machiavelli with half the cau- tion and a hundred times the will. He was
an Italian made skeptical by Vol- taire, subtle by the ruses of survival
in the Revolution, sharp by the daily duel of French intellects. All the
qualities of Renaissance Italy appeared in him: artist and warrior,
philosopher and despot; unified in instincts and pur- poses, quick and
penetrating in thought, direct and overwhelming in action, but unable to
stop. Barring that vital fault, he was the finest master of con- trolled
complexity and coordinated energy in history. Tocqueville put it well:
he was as great as a man can be without virtue, and he was as wise as a
man can be without modesty. Nevertheless he remained within the bounds
of probability when he predicted that the world would not see the likes
of him for many centuries.</p>
