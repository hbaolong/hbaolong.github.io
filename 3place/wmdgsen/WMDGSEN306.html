<h4 id="chapter-xxiii">CHAPTER XXIII</h4>
<p>The Crusades</p>
<p>1095-1291</p>
<p>I. CAUSES</p>
<p>T HE Crusades were the culminating act of the medieval drama, and
perhaps the most picturesque event in the history of Europe and the Near
East. Now at last, after centuries of argument, the two great faiths,
Christianity and Mohammedanism, resorted to man’s ultimate arbitrament—
the supreme court of war. All medieval development, all the expansion of
commerce and Christendom, all the fervor of religious belief, all the
power of feudalism and glamor of chivalry came to a climax in a Two
Hundred Years’ War for the soul of man and the profits of tr ade.</p>
<p>The first proximate cause of the Crusades* was the advance of the
Seljuq Turks. The world had adjusted itself to Moslem control of the
Near East; the Fatimids of Egypt had ruled mildly in Palestine; and
barring some ex- ceptions, the Christian sects there had enjoyed a wide
liberty of worship. Al-Hakim, the mad caliph of Cairo, had destroyed the
church of the Holy Sepulcher (1010), but the Mohammedans themselves had
contributed sub- stantially to its restoration. 1 In 1047 the Moslem
traveler Nasir-i-Khosru de- scribed it as “a most spacious building,
capable of holding 8000 persons, and built with the utmost skill.
Inside, the church is everywhere adorned with Byzantine brocade, worked
in gold. . . . And they have portrayed Jesus — peace be upon Him! —
riding upon an ass.” 2 This was but one of many Chris - tian churches in
Jerusalem. Christian pilgrims had free access to the holy places; a
pilgrimage to Palestine had long been a form of devotion or pen- ance;
everywhere in Europe one met “palmers” who, as a sign of pilgrimage
accomplished, wore crossed palm leaves from Palestine; such men, said
Piers Plowman, “had leave to lie all their lives thereafter.” 3 But in
1070 the Turks took Jerusalem from the Fatimids, and pilgrims began to
bring home ac- counts of oppression and desecration. An old story, not
verifiable, relates that one wayfarer, Peter the Hermit, brought to Pope
Urban II, from Simeon, Patriarch of Jerusalem, a letter detailing the
persecution of Chris- tians there, and imploring papal aid (1088).</p>
<p>The second proximate cause of the Crusades was the dangerous
weakening of the Byzantine Empire. For seven centuries it had stood at
the crossroads</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Spanish cruzada — “marked with the cross.”</li>
</ul>
<p>585</p>
<p>586 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>of Europe and Asia, holding back the armies of Asia and the hordes of
the steppes. Now its internal discords, its disruptive heresies, its
isolation from the West by the schism of 1 054, left it too feeble to
fulfill its historic tas k. While the Bulgars, Patzinaks, Cumans, and
Russians assaulted its European gates, the Turks were dismembering its
Asiatic provinces. In 1071 the Byzantine army was almost annihilated at
Manzikert; the Seljuqs captured Edessa, Antioch ( 1085), Tarsus, even
Nicaea, and gazed across the Bosporus at Constantinople itself. The
Emperor Alexius I (1081-1 1 18) saved a part of Asia Minor by signing a
humiliating peace, but he had no military means of resisting further
attack. If Constantinople should fall, all Eastern Europe would lie open
to the Turks, and the victory of Tours (732) would be un- done.
Forgetting theological pride, Alexius sent delegates to Urban II and the
Council of Piacenza, urging Latin Europe to help him drive back the
Turks; it would be wiser, he argued, to fight the infidels on Asiatic
soil than wait for them to swarm through the Balkans to the Western
capitals.</p>
<p>The third proximate cause of the Crusades was the ambition of the
Italian cities — Pisa, Genoa, Venice, Amalfi — to extend their rising
commercial power. When the Normans captured Sicily from the Moslems ( 1
060-9 1 ) &gt; and Chris- tian arms reduced Moslem rule in Spain ( 1085O
, the western Mediterranean was freed for Christian trade; the Italian
cities, as ports of exit for domestic and transalpine products, grew
rich and strong, and planned to end Moslem ascendancy in the eastern
Mediterranean, and open the markets of the Near East to West European
goods. We do not know how close these Italian merchants were to the ear
of the Pope.</p>
<p>The final decision came from Urban himself. Other popes had
entertained the idea. Gerbert, as Sylvester II, had appealed to
Christendom to rescue Jerusalem, and an abortive expedition had landed
in Syria ( c . 1001). Greg- ory VII, amid his consuming strife with
Henry IV, had exclaimed, “I would rather expose my life in delivering
the holy places than reign over the uni- verse.” 4 That quarrel was
still hot when Urban presided over the Council of Piacenza in March of
1095. He supp orted the plea of Alexius’ legates there, but counseled
delay till a more widely representative assembly might con- sider a war
against Islam. He was too well informed to picture victory as cer- tain
in so distant an enterprise; he doubtless foresaw that failure would
seri- ously damage the prestige of Christianity and the Church. Probably
he longed to channel the disorderly pugnacity of feudal barons and
Norman buccaneers into a holy war to save Europe and Byzantium from
Islam; he dreamed of bringing the Eastern Church again under papal rule,
and visioned a mighty Christendom united under the theocracy of the
popes, with Rome once more the capital of the world. It was a conception
of the highest order of statesmanship.</p>
<p>From March to October of 1095 he toured northern Italy and southern
France, sounding out leaders and ensuring support. At Clermont in

<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>vergne the historic council met; and though it was a cold November,
thou- sands of people came from a hundred communities, pitched their
tents in the open fields, gathered in a vast assemblage that no hall
could hold, and throbbed with emotion as their fellow Frenchman Urban,
raised on a plat- form in their midst, addressed to them in French the
most influential speech in medieval history.</p>
<p>O race of Franks! race beloved and chosen by God! . . . From the</p>
<p>confines of Jerusalem and from Constantinople a grievous report has
gone forth that an accursed race, wholly alienated from God, has vio-
lently invaded the lands of these Christians, and has depopulated them
by pillage and fire. They have led away a part of the captives into</p>
<p>their own country, and a part they have killed by cruel tortures.
They destroy the altars, after having defiled them with their
uncleanliness. The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them, and
has</p>
<p>been deprived of territory so vast in extent that it could not be</p>
<p>traversed in two months’ time.</p>
<p>On whom, then, rests the labor of avenging these wrongs, and of</p>
<p>recovering this territory, if not upon you — you upon whom, above</p>
<p>all others, God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great
bravery, and strength to humble the heads of those who resist you? Let
the</p>
<p>deeds of your ancestors encourage you — the glory and grandeur of
Charlemagne and your other monarchs. Let the Holy Sepulcher of</p>
<p>Our Lord and Saviour, now held by unclean nations, arouse you, and
the holy places that are now stained with pollution. . . . Let none
of</p>
<p>your possessions keep you back, nor anxiety for your family
affairs.</p>
<p>For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the
sea</p>
<p>and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population;
it</p>
<p>scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that
you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many
among you perish in civil strife.</p>
<p>Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels</p>
<p>end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulcher; wrest that land from
a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. Jerusalem is a land
fruitful above all others, a paradise of delights. That royal city,
situated at the center of the earth, implores you to come to her aid.
Undertake this journey eagerly for the remission of your sins, and be
assured of the reward of imperishable glory in the Kingdom of Heaven .

<p>Through the crowd an excited exclamation rose: Dieu li volt — 1 God
wills it!” Urban took it up, and called upon them to make it their
battle cry. He bade those who undertook the crusade to wear a cross upon
brow or breast. “At once,” says William of Malmesbury, “some of the
nobility, falling down at the knees of the Pope, consecrated themselves
and their property to the service of God.” 6 Thousands of the commonalty
pledged themselves li ke- wise; monks and hermits left their retreats to
become in no metaphysical sense</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>588</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>soldiers of Christ. The energetic Pope passed to other cities —
Tours, Bor- deaux, Toulouse, Montpellier, Nimes . . . and for nine
months preached the crusade. When he reached Rome after two years’
absence, he was enthusias - tically acclaimed by the least pious city in
Christendom. He assumed, with no serious opposition, the authority to
release Crusaders from commitments hindering the crusade; he freed the
serf and the vassal, for the duration of the war, from fealty to their
lord; he conferred upon all Crusaders the priv- ilege of being tried by
ecclesiastical instead of manorial courts, and guaran- teed them, during
their absence, the episcopal protection of their property; he commanded
— though he could not quite enforce — a truce to all wars of Christians
against Christians; he established a new principle of obedience above
the code of feudal loyalty. Now, more than ever, Europe was made one.
Urban found himself the accepted master, at least in theory, of Europe’s
kings. All Christendom was moved as never before as it feverishly
prepared for the holy war.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE FIRST CRUSADE: IO95-99</li>
</ol>
<p>Extraordinary inducements brought multitudes to the standard. A
plenary indulgence remitting all punishments due to sin was offered to
those who should fall in the war. Serfs were allowed to leave the soil
to which they had been bound; citizens were exempted from taxes; debtors
enjoyed a morato- rium on interest; prisoners were freed, and sentences
of death were com- muted, by a bold extension of papal authority, to
life service in Palestine. Thousands of vagrants joined in the sacred
tramp. Men tired of hopeless pov- erty, adventurers ready for brave
enterprise, younger sons hoping to carve out fiefs for themselves in the
East, merchants seeking new markets for their goods, knights whose
enlisting serfs had left them laborless, timid spirits shunning taunts
of cowardice, joined with sincerely religious souls to rescue the land
of Christ’s birth and death. Propaganda of the kind customary in war
stressed the disabilities of Christians in Palestine, the atrocities of
Moslems, the blasphemies of the Mohammedan creed; Moslems were described
as worshiping a statue of Mohammed, 7 and pious gossip related how the
Prophet, fallen in an epileptic fit, had been eaten alive by hogs. 8
Fabulous tales were told of Oriental wealth, and of dark beauties
waiting to be taken by brave men. 9</p>
<p>Such a variety of motives could hardly assemble a homogeneous mass
capa- ble of military organization. In many cases women and children
insisted upon accompanying their husbands or parents, perhaps with
reason, for prostitutes soon enlisted to serve the warriors. Urban had
appointed the month of August, 1096, as the time of departure, but the
impatient peasants who were the first recruits could not wait. One such
host, numbering some 1 2,000 per-</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>589</p>
<p>sons (of whom only eight were knights), set out from France in March
under Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless (Gautier sans-Avoir);
another, perhaps 5000 strong, started from Germany under the priest
Gott- schalk; a third advanced from the Rhineland under Count Emico of
Leinin- gen. It was chiefly these disorderly bands that attacked the
Jews of Germany and Bohemia, rejected the appeals of the local clergy
and citizenry, and de- generated for a time into brutes phrasing their
blood lust in piety. The re- cruits had brought modest funds and little
food, and their inexperienced leaders had made scant provision for
feeding them. Many of the marchers had underestimated the distance; and
as they advanced along the Rhine and the Danube the children asked
impatiently, at each turn, was not this Jerusa- lem? 10 When their funds
ran out, and they began to starve, they were forced to pillage the
fields and homes on their route; and soon they added rape to rapine. 11
The population resisted violently; some towns closed their gates against
them, and others bade them Godspeed with no delay. Arriving at last
before Constantinople quite penniless, and decimated by famine, plague,
leprosy, fever, and battles on the way, they were welcomed by Alexius,
but not satisfactorily fed; they broke into the suburbs, and plundered
churches, houses, and palaces. To deliver his capital from these praying
locusts, Alexius provided them with vessels to cross the Bosporus, sent
them supplies, and bade them wait until better armed detachments could
arrive. Whether through hunger or restlessness, the Crusaders ignored
these instructions, and advanced upon Nicaea. A disciplined force of
Turks, all skilled bowmen, marched out from the city and almost
annihilated this first division of the First Crusade. Walter the
Penniless was among the slain; Peter the Hermit, disgusted with his
uncontrollable host, had returned before the battle to Constantinople,
and lived safely till 1 1 15.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the feudal leaders who had taken the cross had assembled
each his own force in his own place. No king was among them; indeed
Philip I of France, William II of England, and Henry IV of Germany were
all under sentence of excommunication when Urban preached the crusade.
But many counts and dukes enlisted, nearly all of them French or Frank;
the First Cru- sade was largely a French enterprise, and to this day the
Near East speaks of West Europeans as Franks. Duke Godfrey, Seigneur of
Bouillon (a small estate in Belgium), combined the qualities of soldier
and monk — brave and competent in war and government, and pious to the
point of fanaticism. Count Bohemund of Taranto was Robert Guiscard’s
son; he had all the cour - age and skill of his father, and dreamed of
slicing a kingdom for himself and his Norman troops out of the former
Byzantine possessions in the Near East. With him was his nephew Tancred
of Hauteville, destined to be the hero of Tasso’s Jerusalem Delivered:
handsome, fearless, gallant, generous, loving glory and wealth, and
universally admired as the ideal of a Christian knight. Raymond, Count
of Toulouse, had already fought Islam in Spain; now, in</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>590</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>old age, he dedicated himself and his vast fortune to the larger war;
but a haughty temper spoiled his nobility, and avarice stained his
piety.</p>
<p>By diverse routes these hosts made their way to Constantinople. Bo-
hemund proposed to Godfrey that they seize the city; Godfrey refused,
say- ing that he had come only to fight infidels; 12 but the idea did
not die. The masculine, half-barbarous knights of the West despised
these subtle and cul- tured gentlemen of the East as heretics lost in
effeminate luxury; they looked with astonishment and envy upon the
riches laid up in the churches, palaces, and markets of the Byzantine
capital, and thought that fortune should belong to the brave. Alexius
may have gotten wind of these notions among his sav- iors; and his
experience with the peasant horde (for whose defeat the West had
censured him) inclined him to caution, perhaps to duplicity. He had
asked for assistance against the Turks, but he had not bargained upon
the united strength of Europe gathering at his gates; he could never be
sure whether these warriors aspired to Jerusalem so much as to
Constantinople, nor whether they would restore to his Empire any
formerly Byzantine terri- tory that they might take from the Turks. He
offered the Crusaders provi- sions, subsidies, transport, military aid,
and, for the leaders, handsome bribes; 13 in return he asked that the
nobles should swear allegiance to him as their feudal sovereign; any
lands taken by them were to be held in fealty to him. The nobles,
softened with silver, swore.</p>
<p>Early in 1097 the armies, totaling some 30,000 men, still under
divided leadership, crossed the straits. Luckily, the Moslems were even
more divided than the Christians. Not only was Moslem power in Spain
spent, and in northern Africa rent with religious faction, but in the
East the Fatimid caliphs of Egypt held southern Syria, while their foes,
the Seljuq Turks, held northern Syria and most of Asia Minor. Armenia
rebelled against its Seljuq conquerors, and allied itself with the
“Franks.” So helped, the arms of Europe advanced to the sieg e of
Nicaea. On Alexius’ pledge that their lives would be spared, the Turkish
garrison surrendered (June 19, 1097). The Greek Em- peror raised the
Imperial flag over the citadel, protected the city from indis- criminate
pillage, and appeased the feudal leaders with substantial gifts; but the
Christian soldiery complained that Alexius was in league with the Turks.
After a week’s rest, the Crusaders set out for Antioch. They met a
Turkish army under Qilij Arslan near Dorylaeum, won a bloody battle
(July 1,</p>
<ol start="1097" type="1">
<li>, and marched through Asia Minor with no other enemies than a short-
age of water and food, and a degree of heat for which the Western blood
was unprepared. Men, women, horses, and dogs died of thirst on that
bitter march of 500 miles. Crossing the Taurus, some nobles separated
their forces from the main army to make private conquests — Raymond,
Bohemund, and God- frey in Armenia, Tancred and Baldwin (brother of
Godfrey) in Edessa; there Baldwin, by strategy and treachery, 14 founded
the first Latin princi- pality in the East (1098). The mass of the
Crusaders complained ominously</li>
</ol>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>59 1</p>
<p>at these delays; the nobles returned, and the advance to Antioch was
resumed. Antioch, described by the chronicler of the Gesta Francorum as
a “city extremely beautiful, distinguished, and delightful,” 15 resisted
siege for eight months. Many Crusaders died from exposure to the cold
winter rains, or from hunger; some found a novel nourishment by chewing
“the sweet reed s called zucra” (Arabic sukkar ) ; now for the first
time the “Franks” tasted</p>
<p>Bohemund became by grateful consent Prince of Antioch. Formally he
held the region in fief to Alexius; actually he ruled it as an
independent sovereign; the chieftains claime d that Alexius’ failure to
come to their aid released them from their vows of allegiance. After
spending six months in refreshing and reorganizing their weakened
forces, they led their armies toward Jerusalem. At last, on June 7,
1099, after a campaign of three years, the Crusaders, reduced to 1 2,000
combatants, stood in exaltation and fatigue before the walls of
Jerusalem. By the humor of history, the Turks whom they had come to
fight had been expelled from the city by the Fatimids a year before. The
caliph offered peace on terms of guaranteed safety for Christian
pilgrims and worshipers in Jerusalem, but Bohemund and Godfrey demanded
unconditional surrender. The Fatimid garrison of 1000 men re- sisted for
forty days. On July 15 Godfrey and Tancred led their followers over the
walls, and the Crusaders knew the ecstasy of a high purpose accom-
plished after heroic suffering. Then, reports the priestly eyewitness
Ray- mond of Agiles,</p>
<p>59 2 the age of faith (chap, xxiii</p>
<p>wonderful things were to be seen. Numbers of the Saracens were be-
headed . . . others were shot with arrows, or forced to jump from the
towers; others were tortured for several days and then burned in</p>
<p>flames. In the streets were seen piles of heads and hands and feet.
One rode about everywhere amid the corpses of men and horses. 19</p>
<p>Other contemporaries contribute details: women were stabbed to death,
suckling babes were snatched by the leg from their mothers’ breasts and
flung over the walls, or had their necks broken by being dashed against
posts; 20 and 70,000 Moslems remaining in the city were slaughtered. The
surviving Jews were herded into a synagogue and burned alive. The
victors flocked to the church of the Holy Sepulcher, whose grotto, they
believed, had once held the crucified Christ. There, embracing one
another, they wept with joy and release, and thanked the God of Mercies
for their victory.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE LATIN KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM: 1099-1143</li>
</ol>
<p>Godfrey of Bouillon, whose exceptional integrity had finally won
recog- nition, was chosen to rule Jerusalem and its environs under the
modest title of Defender of the Holy Sepulcher. Here, where Byzantine
rule had ceased 465 years before, no pretense was made of subordination
to Alexius; the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem became at once a sovereign
state. The Greek Church was disestablished, its patriarch fled to
Cyprus, and the parishes of the new kingdom accepted the Latin liturgy,
an Italian primate, and papal rule.</p>
<p>The price of sovereignty is the capacity for self-defense. Two weeks
after the great liberation, an Egyptian army came up to Ascalon to
reliberate a city holy for too many faiths. Godfrey defeated it, but a
year later he died (1100). His less able brother, Baldwin I (1 100-18),
took the loftier title of king. Under King Fulk, Count of Anjou ( 1 1 3
1-43) , the new state included most of Palestine and Syria; but the
Moslems still held Aleppo, Damascus, and Emesa. The kingdom was divided
into four feudal principalities, center- ing respectively at Jerusalem,
Antioch, Edessa, and Tripolis. Each of the four was parceled into
practically independent fiefs, whose jealous lords made war, coined
money, and otherwise aped sovereignty. The king was elected by the
barons, and was checked by an ecclesiastical hierarchy sub- ject only to
the pope. He was further weakened by ceding the control of several ports
— Jaffa, Tyre, Acre, Beirut, Ascalon — to Venice, Pisa, or Genoa as the
price of naval aid and seaborne supplies. The structure and law of the
kingdom were formulated in the Assizes of Jerusalem — one of the most
log- ical and ruthless codifications of feudal government. The barons
assumed all ownership of land, reduced the former owners — Christian or
Moslem — to the condition of serfs, and laid upon them feudal
obligations severer than any</p>
<p>chap. xxm) the crusades 593</p>
<p>in contemporary Europe. The native Christian population looked back
to Moslem rule as a golden age. 21</p>
<p>The young kingdom had many elements of weakness, but it had a unique
support in new orders of military monks. As far back as 1048 the
merchants of Amalfi had obtained Moslem permission to build a hospital
at Jerusalem for poor or ailing pilgrims. About 1120 the staff of this
institution was re- organized by Raymond du Puy as a religious order
vowed to chastity, pov- erty, obedience, and the military protection of
Christians in Palestine; and these Hospitalers, or Knights of the
Hospital of St. John, became one of the noblest charitable bodies in the
Christian world. About the same time ( 1 1 1 9) Hugh de Payens and eight
other crusader knights solemnly dedicated them- selves to monastic
discipline and the martial service of Christianity. They obtained from
Baldwin II a residence near the site of Solomon’s Temple, and were soon
called Knights Templar. St. Bernard drew up a stern rule for them, which
was not long obeyed; he praised them for being “most learned in the art
of war,” and bade them “wash seldom,” and closely crop their hair. 22
“The Christian who slays the unbeliever in the Holy War,” wrote Bernard
to the Templars, in a passage worthy of Mohammed, “is sure of his
reward; more sure if he himself is slain. The Christian glories in the
death of the pagan, because Christ is thereby glorified”; 23 men must le
arn to kill with a good conscience if they are to fight successful wars.
A Hospitaler wore a black robe with a white cross on the left sleeve; a
Templar a white robe with a red cross on the mantle. Each hated the
other religiously. From protecting and nursing pilgrims the Hospitalers
and Templars passed to active attacks upon Saracen strongholds; though
the Templars numbered but 300, and the Hospitalers some 600, in 1 180,
24 they played a prominent part in the battles of the Crusades, and
earned great repute as warriors. Both orders campaigned for financial
support, and received it from Church and state, from rich and poor; in
the thirteenth century each owned great estates in Europe, includ- ing
abbeys, villages, and towns. Both astonished Christians and Saracens by
building vast fortresses in Syria, where, dedicated individually to
poverty, they enjoyed collective luxury amid the toils of war. 25 In
1190 the Germans in Palestine, aided by a few at home, founded the
Teutonic Knights, and established a hospital near Acre.</p>
<p>Most of the Crusaders returned to Europe after freeing Jerusalem,
leaving the man power of the harassed government perilously low. Many
pilgrims came, but few remained to fight. On the north the Greeks
watched for a chance to recover Antioch, Edessa, and other cities which
they claimed as Byzantine; to the east, the Saracens were being aroused
and unified by Mos- lem appeals and Christian raids. Mohammedan refugees
from Jerusalem told in bitter detail the fall of that city to the
Christians; they stormed the Great Mosque of Baghdad, and demanded that
Moslem arms should liberate Jeru- salem, and the sacred Dome of the
Rock, from unclean infidel hands. 26 The</p>

<p>caliph was powerless to heed their pleas, but Zangi, the young
slave-born Prince of Mosul, responded. In 1 144 his small well-led army
took from the Christians their eastern outpost al-Ruah; and a few months
later he recap- tured Edessa for Islam. Zangi was assassinated, but he
was succeeded by a son, Nur-ud-din, of equal courage and greater
ability. It was the news of these events that stirred Europe to the
Second Crusade.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE SECOND CRUSADE: 1 1 46-8</li>
</ol>
<p>St. Bernard appealed to Pope Eugenius III to sound another call to
arms. Eugenius, enmeshed in conflict with the infidels of Rome, begged
Bernard to undertake the task himself. It was a wise suggestion, for the
saint was a greater man than he whom he had made Pope. When he left his
cell at Clair- vaux to preach the crusade to the French, the skepticism
that hides in the heart of faith was silenced, and the fears spread by
narratives of the First Crusade were stilled. Bernard went directly to
King Louis VII, and per- suaded him to take the cross. With the King at
his side he spoke to a multi- tude at Vezelay (1146); when he had
finished, the crowd enlisted en masse; the crosses prepared proved too
few, and Bernard tore his robe to pieces to provide additional emblems.
“Cities and castles are emptied,” he wrote to the Pope; “there is not
left one man to seven women, and everywhere there are widows to still
living husbands.” Having won France he passed to Germany, where his
fervent eloquence induced the Emperor Conrad III to accept the crusade
as the one cause that could unify the Guelf and Hohenstaufen fac- tions
then rending the realm. Many nobles followed Conrad’s lead; among them
the young Frederick of Swabia who would become Barbarossa, and would die
in the Third Crusade.</p>
<p>At Easter of 1147 Conrad and the Germans set out; at Pentecost Louis
and the French followed at a cautious distance, uncertain whether the
Germans or the Turks were their most hated foes. The Germans felt a like
hesitation between Turks and Greeks; and so many Byzantine towns were
pillaged on the way that many closed their gates, and dispensed a scanty
ration by bas- kets let down from the walls. Manuel Comnenus, now
Eastern Emperor, gently suggested that the noble hosts should cross the
Hellespont at Sestos, instead of going through Constantinople; but
Conrad and Louis refused. A party in Louis’ council urged him to take
Constantinople for France; he refrained; but again the Greeks may have
learned of his temptation. They were frightened by the stature and armor
of the Western knights, and amused by their feminine entourage. His
troublesome Eleanor accompanied Louis, and troubadours accompanied the
Queen; the counts of Flanders and Toulouse were escorted by their
countesses, and the baggage train of the French was heavy with trunks
and boxes of apparel and cosmetics designed</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>595</p>
<p>to ensure the beauty of these ladies against all the vicissitudes of
climate, war, and time. Manuel hastened to transport the two armies
across the Bos- porus, and supplied the Greeks with debased coinage for
dealings with the Crusaders. In Asia a dearth of provisions, and the
high prices demanded by the Greeks, led to many conflicts between
saviors and saved; and Frederick of the Red Beard mourned that his sword
had to shed Christian blood for the privilege of encountering
infidels.</p>
<p>Conrad insisted, against Manuel’s advice, on taking the route
followed by the First Crusade. Despite or because of their Greek guides,
the Germans fell into a succession of foodless wastes and Moslem snares;
and their loss of life was disheartening. At Dorylaeum, where the First
Crusade had de- feated Qilij Arslan, Conrad’s army met the main Moslem
force, and was so badly beaten that hardly one Christian in ten
survived. The French army, far behind, was deceived by false news of a
German victory; it advanced recklessly, and was decimated by starvation
and Moslem raids. Reaching Attalia, Louis bargained with Greek ship
captains to transport his army by sea to Christian Tarsus or Antioch;
the captains demanded an impossible fee per passenger; Louis and several
nobles, Eleanor and several ladies, took passage to Antioch, leaving the
French army in Attalia. Mohammedan forces swept down upon the city, and
slaughtered nearly every Frenchman in it (1148).</p>
<p>Louis reached Jerusalem with ladies but no army, Conrad with a
pitiful remnant of the force with which he had left Ratisbon. From these
survivors, and soldiers already in the capital, an army was improvised,
and marched against Damascus under the divided command of Conrad, Louis,
and Bald- win III (1143-62). During the siege disputes arose among the
nobles as to which should rule Damascus when it fell. Moslem agents
found their way into the Christian army, and bribed certain leaders to a
policy of inaction or retreat. 27 When word came that the emirs of
Aleppo and Mosul were advancing with a large force to relieve Damascus,
the advocates of retreat prevailed; the Christian army broke into
fragments, and fled to Antioch, Acre, or Jerusalem. Conrad, defeated and
diseased, returned in disgrace to Germany. Eleanor and most of the
French knights returned to France. Louis remained another year in
Palestine, making pilgrimages to sacred shrines.</p>
<p>Europe was stunned by the collapse of the Second Crusade. Men began
to ask how it was that the Almighty allowed His defenders to be so
humili- ated; critics assailed St. Bernard as a reckless visionary who
had sent men to their death; and here and there emboldened skeptics
called in question the most basic tenets of the Christian faith. Bernard
replied that the ways of the Almighty are beyond human understanding,
and that the disaster must have been a punishment for Christian sins.
But from this time the philosophic doubts that Abelard (d. 1142) had
scattered found expression even among the people. Enthusiasm for the
Crusades rapidly waned; and the Age of Faith</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>596</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>prepared to defend itself by fire and sword against the inroads of
alien be- liefs, or no belief at all.</p>
<p>V. SALADIN</p>
<p>Meanwhile a strange new civilization had developed in Christian Syria
and Palestine. The Europeans who had settled there since 1099 gradually
adopted the Near Eastern garb of wound headdress and flowing robe as
suited to a climate of sun and sand. As they became more familiar with
the Moslems living in the kingdom, mutual unfamiliarity and hostility
decreased. Moslem merchants freely entered Christian settlements and
sold their wares; Mos- lem and Jewish physicians were preferred by
Christian patients; 28 Moslem worship in mosques was permitted by the
Christian clergy; and the Koran was taught in Moslem schools in
Christian Antioch and Tripolis. Safe conducts for travelers and traders
were exchanged between Christian and Moslem states. As only a few
Christian wives had come with the Crusaders, many Christian settlers
married Syrian women; soon their mixed offspring constituted a large
element of the population. Arabic became the daily speech of all
commoners. Christian princes made alliances with Moslem emirs against
Christian rivals, and Moslem emirs sometimes asked the aid of the
“polytheists” in diplomacy or war. Personal friendships developed
between Christians and Mohammedans. Ibn Jubair, who toured Christian
Syria in 1183, described his fellow Moslems there as prosperous, and as
well treated by the Franks. He mourned to see Acre “swarming with pigs
and crosses,” and odorous with a vile European smell, but he had some
hopes that the infidels would gradually be civilized by the superior
civilization to which they had come. 29</p>
<p>In the forty years of peace that followed the Second Crusade, the
Latin kingdom of Jerusalem continued to be torn with internal strife,
while its Moslem enemies moved toward unity. Nur-ud-din spread his power
from Aleppo to Damascus (1164); when he died, Saladin brought Egypt and
Moslem Syria under one rule (1175). Genoese, Venetian, and Pisan</p>
<p>merchants disordered the Eastern ports with their mortal rivalry.
Knights quarreled for the royal power in Jerusalem; and when Guy de
Lusignan maneuvered his way to the throne (1186), disaffection spread
among the aristocracy; “if this Guy is a king,” said his brother
Geoffrey, “I am worthy</p>

<p>597</p>
<p>Egyptian detachment, and all were cut down except a few who escaped
with Reginald, and some prisoners who were taken to Mecca and slaugh-
tered instead of goats at the annual pilgrimage sacrifice (1183).</p>
<p>Saladin had heretofore contented himself with minor forays against
Pal- estine; now, offended to the depths of his piety, he re-formed the
army that had won him Damascus, and met the forces of the Latin kingdom
in an in- decisive battle on the historic plain of Esdraelon ( 1 1 83) .
A few months later he attacked Reginald at Karak, but failed to enter
the citadel. In 1185 he signed a four-year truce with the Latin kingdom.
But in 1186 Reginald, bored with peace, waylaid a Moslem caravan, and
took rich booty and sev- eral prisoners, including Saladin’s sister.
“Since they trusted in Mohammed,” said Reginald, “let Mohammed come and
save them.” Mohammed did not come; but Saladin, infuriated, sounded the
call for a holy war against the Christians, and swore to kill Reginald
with his own hand.</p>
<p>The crucial engagement of the Crusades was fought at Hittin, near
Tibe- rias, on July 4, 1187. Saladin, familiar with the terrain, took up
positions controlling all the wells; the heavily armored Christians,
having marched across the plain in midsummer heat, entered battle
gasping with thirst. Taking advantage of the wind, the Saracens started
a brush fire whose smoke further harassed the Crusaders. In the blind
confusion the Frank footmen were sep- arated from the cavalry, and were
cut down; the knights, fighting with desperation against weapons, smoke,
and thirst, at last fell exhausted to the ground, and were captured or
slain. Apparently by Saladin’s orders, no mercy was shown to Templars or
Hospitalers. He directed that King Guy and Duke Reginald be brought
before him; to the King he gave drink as a pledge of pardon; to Reginald
he gave the choice of death or acknowledging Mohammed as a prophet of
God; when Reginald refused, Saladin slew him. Part of the booty taken by
the victors was the True Cross, which had been borne as a battle
standard by a priest; Saladin sent it to the caliph at Bagh- dad. Seeing
that no army remained to challenge him, he proceeded to cap- ture Acre,
where he freed 4000 Moslem prisoners, and paid his troops with the
wealth of the busy port. For a few months nearly all Palestine was in
his hands.</p>
<p>As he approached Jerusalem the leading citizens came out to bid for
peace. “I believe,” he told them, “that Jerusalem is the home of God ,
as you also believe; and I will not willingly lay siege to it, or put it
to assault.” He of - fered it freedom to fortify itself, and to
cultivate unhindered the land for fifteen miles around, and promised to
supply all deficiencies of money and food, until Pentecost; if, when
that day came, they saw hope of being res- cued, they might keep the
city and honorably resist him; if no such prospect appeared, they were
to yield peaceably, and he would spare the lives and property of the
Christian inhabitants. The delegates refused the offer, say- ing that
they would never surrender the city where the Saviour had died</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>598</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>for mankind. 31 The siege lasted only twelve days. When the city
capitu- lated, Saladin required a ransom of ten gold pieces (7.50?) for
each man, five for each woman, one for each child; the poorest 7000 were
to be freed on the surrender of the 30,000 gold bezants ( c . 70,000)
which had been sent to the Hospitalers by Henry II of England. These
terms were accepted, says a Christian chronicler, “with gratitude and
lamentation”; perhaps some learned Christians compared these events of
1187 with those of 1099. Sala- din’s brother al -Adil asked for the gift
of a thousand slaves from the still unransomed poor; it was granted, and
he freed them. Balian, leader of the Christian resistance, asked a like
boon, received it, and freed another thou- sand; the Christian primate
asked and received and did likewise. Then Sala- din said: “My broth er
has made his alms, and the patriarch and Balian have made theirs; now I
would make mine”; and he freed all the old who could not pay. Apparently
some 1 5,000 of the 60,000 captured Christians remained unransomed, and
became slaves. Among the ransomed were the wives and daughters of the
nobles who had been killed or captured at Hittin. Softened by their
tears, Saladin released to them such husbands and fathers (including
King Guy) as could be ’found in Moslem captivity, and (relates Ernoul,
squire to Balian) to “the dames and damsels whose lords were dead he dis
- tributed from his own treasure so much that they gave praise to God,
and published abroad the kindness and honor that Saladin had done them.”
32 The freed King and nobles took an oath never to bear arms against him
again. Safe in Christian Tripolis and Antioch, they were “released by
the sentence of the clergy from the enormity of their promise,” and laid
plans of vengeance against Saladin. 33 The Sultan allowed the Jews to
dwell again in Jerusalem, and gave Christians the right to enter, but
unarmed; he assisted their pilgrimage, and protected their security. 34
The Dome of the Rock, which had been converted into a church, was
purified from Christian taint by sprinkling with rose water, and the
golden cross that had surmounted the cupola was cast down amid Moslem
cheers and Christian groans. Saladin led his wearied troops to the siege
of Tyre, found it impregnable, dismissed most of his army, and retired
ill and worn to Damascus ( 1 1 88) , in the fiftieth year of his
age.</p>

<p>The retention of Tyre, Antioch, and Tripolis left the Christians
some</p>
<p>strands of hope. Italian fleets still controlled the Mediterranean,
and stood ready to carry fresh Crusaders for a price. William,
Archbishop of Tyre, returned to Europe, and recounted to assemblies in
Italy, France, and Ger- many the fall of Jerusalem. At Mainz his appeal
so moved Frederick Barba- rossa that the great Emperor, sixty-seven
years old, set out almost at once</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>with his army (1189), and all Christendom applauded him as the second
Moses who would open a way to the Promised Land. Crossing the Helles-
pont at Gallipoli, the new host, on a new route, repeated the errors and
tragedies of the First Crusade. Turkish bands harassed its march and cut
off its supplies; hundreds starved to death; Frederick was drowned
ignomini- ously in the little river of Salef in Cilicia ( 1190) ; and
only a fraction of his army survived to join in the siege of Acre.</p>
<p>Richard I of the Lion Heart, recently crowned King of England at
the</p>
<p>age of thirty-one, resolved to try his hand on the Moslems. Fearing
French encroachment, in his absence, upon English possessions in France,
he in- sisted that Philip Augustus should accompany him; the French king
— a lad of twenty-three — agreed; and the two youthful monarchs received
the cross from William of Tyre in a moving ceremony at Vezelay.
Richard’s army of Normans (for few Englishmen took part in the Crusades)
sailed from Marseille, Philip’s army from Genoa, for a rendezvous in
Sicily (1190). There the kings quarreled and otherwise amused themselves
for half a year. Tancred, King of Sicily, offended Richard, who seized
Mes sina “quicker than a priest could chant matins,” and restored it for
40,000 ounces of gold. So solvent, he embarked his army for Palestine.
Some of his ships were wrecked on the coast of Cyprus; the crews were
imprisoned by the Greek governor; Richard paused for a moment, conquered
Cyprus, and gave it to Guy de Lusignan, the homeless king of Jerusalem.
He reached Acre in June of 1 19 1, a year after leaving Vezelay. Philip
had preceded him; the siege of Acre by the Christians had already lasted
nineteen months, and had cost thousands of lives. A few weeks after
Richard’s arrival the Saracens surren - dered. The victors asked, and
were promised, 200,000 gold pieces (50,000) , 1600 selected prisoners,
and the restoration of the True Cross. Saladin con- firmed the
agreement, and the Moslem population of Acre, excepting the 1600, were
allowed to depart with such provisions as they could carry. Philip
Augustus, ill with fever, returned to France, leaving behind him a
French force of 10,500 men. Richard became sole leader of the Third
Crusade.</p>
<p>Now began a confused and unique campaign in which blows and battles
alternated with compliments and courtesies, while the English King and
the Kurd Sultan illustrated some of the finest qualities of their
civilizations and creeds. Neither was a saint: Saladin could dispense
death with vigor when military purposes seemed to him to require it; and
the romantic Rich- ard permitted some interruptions in his career as a
gentleman. When the leaders of besieged Acre delayed in carrying out the
agreed terms of sur- render, Richard had 2500 Moslem prisoners beheaded
before the walls as a hint to hurry. 35 When Saladin learned of this he
ordered the execution of all prisoners thereafter taken in battle with
the English King. Changing his</p>
<p>600 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>tune, Richard proposed to end the Crusades by marrying his sister
Joan to Saladin’s brother al -Adil. The Church denounced the scheme, and
it was dropped.</p>
<p>Knowing that Saladin would not stay quiet in defeat, Richard
reorganized his forces and prepared to march sixty miles southward along
the coast to relieve Jaffa, which, again in Christian hands, was under
Moslem siege. Many nobles refused to go with him, preferring to stay
behind in Acre and intrigue for the kingship of the Jerusalem which they
trusted Richard would take. The German troops returned to Germany, and
the French army repeatedly disobeyed the orders, and frustrated the
strategy, of the British King. Nor were the rank and file ready for
renewed effort. After the long siege, says the Christian chronicler of
Richard’s crusade, the victorious Christians,</p>
<p>given up to sloth and luxury, were loath to leave a city so rich in
com- forts — to wit, the choicest of wines and the fairest of damsels.
Many, by a too intimate acquaintance with these pleasures, became
dissolute, till the city was polluted by their luxury, and their
gluttony and wan- tonness put wise men to the blush. 36</p>
<p>Richard made matters more difficult by ordering that no women should
ac- company the army except washerwomen, who could not be an occasion of
sin. He atoned for the defects of his troops by the excellence of his
general- ship, the skill of his engineering, and his inspiring valor on
the field; in these respects he excelled Saladin, as well as all other
Christian leaders of the Crusades.</p>
<p>His army met Saladin’s at Arsuf, and won an indecisive victory (i
191). Saladin offered to renew battle, but Richard withdrew his men
within Jaffa’s walls. Saladin sent him an offer of peace. During the
negotiations Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, who held Tyre, entered into
separate correspond- ence with Saladin, proposing to become his ally,
and retake Acre for the Moslems, if Saladin would agree to his
appropriating Sidon and Beirut. De- spite this offer, Saladin authorized
his brother to sign with Richard a peace yielding to the Christians all
the coastal cities that they then held, and half of Jerusalem. Richard
was so pleased that he ceremoniously conferred knight- hood upon the son
of the Moslem ambassador ( 1 192) . A while later, hearing that Saladin
was faced with revolt in the East, he rejected Saladin’s terms, besieged
and took Darum, and advanced to within twelve miles of Jerusalem.
Saladin, who had dismissed his troops for the winter, called them back
to arms. Meanwhile dissension broke out in the Christian camp, scouts
reported that the wells on the road to Jerusalem had been poisoned, and
the army would have nothing to drink. A council was held to decide
strategy; it voted to abandon Jerusalem and march upon Cairo, 250 miles
away. Richard, sick, disgusted, and despondent, retired to Acre, and
thought of returning to England.</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>601</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>But when he heard that Saladin had again attacked Jaffa, and had
taken it in two days, Richard’s pride revived him. With such troops as
he could muster he sailed at once for Jaffa. Arrived in the harbor, he
cried, “Perish - diers soon had enough; they reproached him for having
spared the Jaffa gar- rison, which was now fighting again. Finally, if
we may believe the Christian account, Richard rode along the Saracen
front, lance at rest, and none dared attack him. 37</p>
<p>On the next day fortune changed. Reinforcements reached Saladin; and
Richard, sick again, and unsupported by the knights at Acre and Tyre,
once more sued for peace. In his fever he cried out for fruit and a
cooling drink; Saladin sent him pears and peaches and snow, and his own
physician. On September 2, 1192, the two heroes signed a peace for three
years, and parti- tioned Palestine: Richard was to keep all the coastal
cities he had conquered, from Acre to Jaffa; Moslems and Christians were
to pass freely into and from each other’s t erritory, and pilgrims would
be protected in Jerusalem; but that city was to remain in Moslem hands.
(Perhaps the Italian merchants, interested chiefly in controlling the
ports, had persuaded Richard to yield the Holy City in return for the
coastal area.) The peace was celebrated with feasts and tournaments;
“God alone,” says Richard’s chronicler, “knoweth</p>
<p>Saladin’s moderation, patience, and justice had defeated Richard’s
bril - liance, courage, and military art; the relative unity and
fidelity of the Mos- lem leaders had triumphed over the divisions and
disloyalties of the feudal chiefs; and a short line of supplies behind
the Saracens proved of greater advantage than Christian control of the
seas. The Christian virtues and faults were better exemplified in the
Moslem sultan than in the Christian king. Saladin was religious to the
point of persecution, and allowed himself to be unreasonably bitter
against the Templars and Hospitalers. Usually, however, he was gentle to
the weak, merciful to the vanquished, and so superior to his enemies in
faithfulness to his word that Christian chroniclers wondered how so
wrong a theology could produce so fine a man. He treated his serv- ant s
with gentleness, and himself heard all petitions. He “esteemed money</p>
<p>602</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>as little as dust,” and left only one dinar in his personal treasury.
40 Not long before his death he gave his son ez-Zahir instructions that
no Christian phi- losopher could surpass:</p>

<p>that way lies peace. Abstain from shedding blood . . . for blood
that</p>

<li>THE FOURTH CRUSADE: I202-4</li>
</ol>
<p>The Third Crusade had freed Acre, but had left Jerusalem unredeemed;
it was a discouragingly small result from the participation of Europe’s
great - est kings. The drowning of Barbarossa, the flight of Philip
Augustus, the brilliant failure of Richard, the unscrupulous intrigues
of Christian knights in the Holy Land, the conflicts between Templars
and Hospitalers, and the renewal of war between England and France broke
the pride of Europe and further weakened the theological assurance of
Christendom. But the early death of Saladin, and the breakup of his
empire, released new hopes. Inno- cent III ( 1 198-1 2 16), at the very
outset of his pontificate, demanded another effort; and Fulk de Neuilly,
a simple priest, preached the Fourth Crusade to commoners and kings. The
results were disheartening. The Emperor Frederick II was a boy of four;
Philip Augustus thought one crusade enough for a lifetime; and Richard
I, forgetting his last word to Saladin, laughed at Fulk’s exhortations.
“You advise me,” he said, “to dismiss my three daugh - ters — pride,
avarice, and incontinence. I bequeath them to the most deserv- ing: my
pride to the Templars, my avarice to the monks of Citeaux, my
incontinence to the prelates.” 42 But Innocent persisted. He suggested
that a campaign against Egypt could succeed through Italian control of
the Medi- terranean, and would offer a means of approaching Jerusalem
from rich and fertile Egypt as a base. After 0 much haggling Venice
agreed, in return for 85,000 marks of silver (,500,000), to furnish
shipping for 4500 knights and horses, 9000 squires, 20,000 infantry, and
supplies for nine months; it would also provide fifty war galleys; but
on condition that half the spoils of conquest should go to the Venetian
Republic. 42 The Venetians, how- ever, had no intention of attacking
Egypt; they made millions annually by exporting timber, iron, and arms
to Egypt, and importing slaves; they did not propose to jeopardize this
trade with war, or to share it with Pisa and Genoa. While negotiating
with the Crusaders’ committee, they made a secret</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>603</p>
<p>treaty with the sultan of Egypt, guaranteeing that country against
invasion (1201). 44 Ernoul, a contemporary chronicler, alleges that
Venice received a huge bribe to divert the crusade from Palestine.
45</p>
<p>In the summer of 1202 the new hosts gathered in Venice. There were
Marquis Boniface of Montferrat, Count Louis of Blois, Count Baldwin of
Flanders, Simon de Montfort of Albigensian fame, and, among many other
notables, Geoffroi de Villehardouin (1160-1213), Marshal of Champagne,
who would not only play a leading part in the diplomacy and campaigns of
the crusade, but would enshrine its scandalous history in face-saving
memoirs that marked the beginning of French prose literature. France, as
usual, supplied most of the Crusaders. Every man had been instructed to
bring a sum of money, proportionate to his means, to raise the 85,000
marks payable to Venice for her outlay. The total fell short by 34,000
marks. Thereupon Enrico Dandolo, the almost blind doge “of the great
heart,” with all the sanctity of his ninety-four years, proposed that
the unpaid bal- ance should be forgiven if the Crusaders would help
Venice capture Zara. This was now the most important Adriatic port after
Venice itself; it had been conquered by Venice in 998, had often
revolted and been subdued; it now belonged to Hungary, and was that co
untry’s only outlet to the sea; its wealth and power were growing, and
Venice feared its competition for the Adriatic trade. Innocent III
denounced the proposal as villainous, and threatened to excommunicate
all participants. But the greatest and most powerful of the popes could
not make his voice heard above the clamor of gold. The combined fleets
attacked Zara, took it in five days, and di- vided the spoils. Then the
Crusaders sent an embassy to the Pope begging his absolution; he gave
it, but demanded the restoration of the booty; they thanked him for the
absolution, and kept the booty. The Venetians ignored the
excommunications, and proceeded to the second part of their plan — the
conquest of Constantinople.</p>
<p>The Byzantine monarchy had learned nothing from the Crusades. It gave
little help, and derived much profit; it regained most of Asia Minor,
and looked with equanimity upon the mutual weakening of Islam and the
West in the struggle for Palestine. The Emperor Manuel had arrested
thousands of Venetians in Constantinople, and had for a time ended
Venetian commer- cial privileges there (1 171). 40 Isaac II Angelus
(1185-95) had not scrupled to ally himself with the Saracens. 47 In 1195
Isaac was deposed, imprisoned, and blinded by his brot her Alexius III.
Isaac’s son, another Alexius, fled to Germany; in 1202 he went to
Venice, asked the Venetian Senate and the Crusaders to rescue and
restore his father, and promised in return all that Byzantium could
supply for their attack upon Islam. Dandolo and the French barons drove
a hard bargain with the youth: he was persuaded to pledge the Crusaders
200,000 marks of silver, equip an army of 1 0,000 men for service in
Palestine, and submit the Greek Orthodox Church to the</p>

<p>Roman Pope. 48 Despite this subtle sop, Innocent III forbade the
Crusaders, on pain of excommunication, to attack Byzantium. Some nobles
refused to share in the expedition; a part of the army considered itself
absolved from the Crusade, and went home. But the prospect of capturing
the richest city in Europe proved irresistible. On October 1, 1202, the
great fleet of 480 vessels sailed amid much rejoicing, while priests on
the war-castles of the ships sang Vent Creator Spiritus , 49</p>
<p>After divers delays the armada arrived before Constantinople on June
24,</p>
<ol start="1203" type="1">
<li>“You may be assured,” says Villehardouin,</li>
</ol>
<p>that those who had never seen Constantinople opened wide eyes now;
for they could not believe that so rich a city could be in the whole</p>
<p>world, when they saw her lofty walls and her stately towers
where-</p>
<p>with she was encompassed, and these stately palaces and lofty</p>
<p>churches, so many in number as no man might believe who had not seen
them, and the length and breadth of this town which was sov- ereign over
all others. And know that there was no man among us so bold but that his
flesh crept at the sight; and therein was no marvel; for never did any
men undertake so great a business as this assault of ours, since the
beginning of the world. 50</p>
<p>An ultimatum was delivered to Alexius III: he must restore the Empire
to his blinded brother or to the young Alexius, who accompanied the
fleet. When he refused, the Crusaders landed, against weak opposition,
before the walls of the city; and the aged Dandolo was the first to
touch the shore. Alexius III fled to Thrace; the Greek nobles escorted
Isaac Angelus from his dungeon to the throne, and in his name a message
was sent to the Latin chieftains that he was waiting to welcome his son.
After drawing from Isaac a promise to abide by the commitments that his
son had made with them, Dandolo and the barons entered the city, and the
young Alexius IV was crowned coemperor. But when the Greeks learned of
the price at which he had bought his victory they turned against him in
anger and scorn. The people reckoned the taxes that would be needed to
raise the subsidies prom- ised to his saviors; the nobility resented the
presence of an alien aristocracy and force; the clergy rejected with
fury the proposal that they should bow to Rome. Meanwhile some Latin
soldiers, horrified to find Moslems worship- ing in a mosque in a
Christian city, set fire to the mosque, and slew the wor- shipers. The
fire raged for eight days, spread through three miles, and laid a
considerable section of Constantinople in ashes. A prince of royal blood
led a popular revolt, killed Alexius IV, reimprisoned Isaac Angelus,
took the throne as Alexius V Ducas, and began to organize an army to
drive the Latins from their camp at Galata. But the Greeks had been too
long secure within their walls to have kept the virtues of their Roman
name. After a month of siege they surrendered; Alexius V fled, and the
victorious Latins passed like consuming locusts through the capital
(1204).</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>605</p>
<p>So long kept from their promised prey, they now — in Easter week —
sub- jected the rich city to such spoliation as Rome had never suffered
from Van- dals or Goths. Not many Greeks were killed — perhaps 2000; but
pillage was unconfined. The nobles divided the palaces among them, and
appropriated the treasures they found there; the soldiers entered homes,
churches, shops, and took whatever caught their fancy. Churches were
rifled not only of the gold, silver, and jewels accumulated by them
through a millennium, but of sacred relics that would later be peddled
in Western Europe at good prices. St. Sophia suffered more damage than
the Turks would inflict upon it in 1453; 51 the great altar was torn to
pieces to distribute its silver and gold. 52 The Venetians, familiar
with the city that had once welcomed them as mer- chants, knew where the
greatest treasures lay, and stole with superior intelli- gence; statues
and textiles, slaves and gems, fell discriminately into their hands; the
four bronze horses that had surveyed the Greek city would now romp over
the Piazza di San Marco; nine tenths of the collections of art and
jewelry that would later distinguish the Treasury of St. Mark’s came fr
om this well-managed theft. 53 Some attempt was made to limit rape; many
of the soldiers modestly contented themselves with prostitutes; but
Innocent III complained that the pent-up lust of the Latins spared
neither age nor sex nor religious profession, and that Greek nuns had to
bear the embraces of French or Venetian peasants or grooms. 54 Amid the
pillage libraries were ransacked, and precious manuscripts were ruined
or lost; two further fires consumed libraries and museums as well as
churches and homes; of the plays of Sopho- cles and Euripides, till then
completely preserved, only a minority survived. Thousands of art
masterpieces were stolen, mutilated, or destroyed.</p>
<p>When the riot of rapine had subsided, the Latin nobles chose Baldwin
of Flanders to head the Latin kingdom of Constantinople (1204), and made
French its official language. The Byzantine Empire was divided into
feudal dominions, each ruled by a Latin noble. Venice, eager to control
the routes of trade, secured Hadrianople, Epirus, Acarnania, the Ionian
Isles, part of the Peloponnesus, Euboea, the Aegean Isles, Gallipoli,
and three eighths of Constantinople; the Genoese were dispossessed of
their Byzantine “facto - ries” and outposts; and Dandolo, now limping in
imperial buski ns, took the title of “Doge of Venice, Lord of One Fourth
and One Eighth of the Roman Empire”; 55 soon afterward he died, in the
fullness of his unscrupulous suc - cess. The Greek clergy were mostly
replaced by Latins, in some cases pre- cipitated into holy orders for
the occasion; and Innocent III, still protesting against the attack,
accepted with grace the formal reunion of the Greek with the Latin
Church. Most of the Crusaders returned home with their spoils; some
settled in the new dominions; only a handful reached Palestine, and
without effect. Perhaps the Crusaders thought that Constantinople, in
their hands, would be a stronger base against the Turks than Byzantium
had been. But generations of strife between the Latins and the Greeks
now absorbed</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>the vitality of the Greek world; the Byzantine Empire never recovered
from the blow; and the capture of Constantinople by the Latins prepared,
across two centuries, its capture by the Turks.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE COLLAPSE OF THE CRUSADES: 1212-91</li>
</ol>
<p>The scandal of the Fourth Crusade, added in a decade to the failure
of the Third, gave no comfort to a Christian faith soon to be faced with
the redis- covery of Aristotle and the subtle rationalism of Averroes.
Thinkers were much exercised to explain why God had allowed the defeat
of His defenders in so holy a cause, and had granted success only to
Venetian villainy. Amid these doubts it occurred to simple souls that
only innocence could regain the citadel of Christ. In 1212 a German
youth vaguely known to history as Nicholas announced that God had
commissioned him to lead a crusade of children to the Holy Land. Priests
as well as laity condemned him, but the idea spread readily in an age
even more subject than most to waves of emo- tional enthusiasm. Parents
struggled to deter their children, but thousands of boys (and some girls
in boys’ clothing), averaging twelve years, slipped away and followed
Nicholas, perhaps glad to escape from the monarchy of the home to the
freedom of the road. The swarm of 30,000 children, leaving mostly from
Cologne, passed down the Rhine and over the Alps. Many died of hunger;
some stragglers were eaten by wolves; thieves mingled with the marchers
and stole their clothing and food. The survivors reached Genoa, where
the earthy Italians laughed them into doubt; no ships would carry them
to Palestine; and when they appealed to Innocent III he gently told them
to go home. Some marched disconsolately back over the Alps; many settled
in Genoa and learned the ways of a commercial world.</p>
<p>In France, in this same year, a twelve-year-old shepherd named
Stephen came to Philip Augustus, and announced that Christ, appearing to
him while he tended his flock, had bidden him lead a ch ildren’s crusade
to Palestine. The king ordered him to return to his muttons;
nevertheless 20,000 young- sters gathered to follow Stephen’s lead. They
made their way across France to Marseille, where, Stephen had promised
them, the ocean would divide to let them reach Palestine dryshod. It
failed them; but two shipowners offered to take them to their
destination without charge. They crowded into seven ships, and sailed
forth singing hymns of victory. Two of the ships were wrecked off
Sardinia, with the loss of all on board; the other children were brought
to Tunisia or Egypt, where they were sold as slaves. The shipowners were
hanged by order of Frederick II. 50</p>
<p>Three years later Innocent III, at the Fourth Lateran Council, again
ap- pealed to Europe to recover the land of Christ, and returned to the
plan that Venice had frustrated — an attack upon Egypt. In 1217 the
Fifth Crusade left</p>

<p>6 07</p>
<p>Germany, Austria, and Hungary under the Hungarian King Andrew, and
safely reached Damietta, at the easternmost mouth of the Nile. The city
fell after a year’s siege; and Malik al -Kamil, the new Sultan of Egypt
and Syria, offered terms of peace — the surrender of most of Jerusalem,
the liberation of Christian prisoners, the return of the True Cross. The
Crusaders demanded an indemnity as well, which al-Kamil refused. The war
was resumed, but went badly; expected reinforcements did not come;
finally an eight-year truce was signed that gave the Crusaders the True
Cross, but restored Dami- etta to the Moslems, and required the
evacuation of all Christian troops from Egyptian soil.</p>
<p>The Crusaders blamed their tragedy upon Frederick II, the young Em-
peror of Germany and Italy. He had taken the crusader’s vow in 1215, and
had promised to join the besiegers at Damietta; but political
complications in Italy, and perhaps an inadequate faith, detained him.
In 1228, while excom- municate for his delays, Frederick set out on the
Sixth Crusade. Arrived in Palestine, he received no help from the good
Christians there, who shunned an outlaw from the Church. He sent
emissaries to al-Kamil, who was now leading the Saracen army at Nablus.
Al-Kamil replied courteously; and the Sultan’s ambassador, Fakhru’d Din,
was impressed by Frederick’s knowledge of the Arabic language,
literature, science, and philosophy. The two rulers entered into a
friendly exchange of compliments and ideas; and to the aston- ishment of
both Christendom and Islam they signed a treaty (1229) by which al-Kamil
ceded to Frederick Acre, Jaffa, Sidon, Nazareth, Bethlehem, and all of
Jerusalem except the enclosure — sacred to Islam — containing the Dome
of the Rock. Christian pilgrims were to be admitted to this enclosure to
perform their prayers on the site of Solomon’s Temple; and similar
rights were to be enjoyed by Mohammedans in Bethlehem. All prisoners on
either side were to be released; and for ten years and ten months each
side pledged itself to peace/’ 7 The excommunicate Emperor had succeeded
wher e for a century Christendom had failed; the two cultures, brought
together for a moment in mutual understanding and respect, had found it
possible to be friends. The Christians of the Holy Land rejoiced, but
Pope Gregory IX de- nounced the pact as an insult to Christendom, and
refused to ratify it. After Frederick’s departure the Christian nobility
of Palestine took control of Jerusalem, and allied the Christian power
in Asia with the Moslem ruler of Damascus against the Egyptian Sultan
(1244). The latter called to his aid the Khwarazmian Turks, who captured
Jerusalem, plundered it, and mas- sacred a large number of its
inhabitants. Two months later Baibars defeated the Christians at Gaza,
and Jerusalem once more fell to Islam (October,</p>
<p>1244).</p>
<p>While Innocent IV preached a crusade against Frederick II, and
offered to all who would war against the Emperor in Italy the same
indulgences and privileges granted to those who served in the Holy Land,
the saintly Louis</p>
<p>6 o8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>IX of France organized the Seventh Crusade. Shortly after the fall of
Jeru- salem he took the cross, and persuaded his nobles to do likewise;
to certain reluctant ones, at Christmas, he presented costly garments
bearing an in- woven cross. He labored to reconcile Innocent with
Frederick, so that a united Europe might support the Crusade. Innocent
refused; instead, he sent a friar — Giovanni de Piano Carpini — to the
Great Khan, suggesting a union of Mongols and Christians against the
Turks; the Khan replied by inviting the submission of Christendom to the
Mongol power. At last, in 1 248, Louis set out with his French knights,
including Jean Sieur de Joinville, who would narrate the exploits of his
King in a famous chronicle. The expedition reached Damietta, and soon
captured it; but the annual inundation of the Nile, which had been
forgotten in planning the campaign, began as the Cru- saders arrived,
and so flooded the country that they were confined to Dami- etta for
half a year. The y did not altogether regret it; “the barons,” says
Joinville, “took to giving great feasts . . . and the common people took
to consorting with lewd women.” 58 When the army resumed its march it
was depleted by hunger, disease, and desertion, and weakened with
indiscipline. At Mansura, despite brave fighting, it was defeated, and
fled in wild rout; 10,000 Christians were captured, including Louis
himself, fainting with dys- entery (1250). An Arab physician cured him;
after a month of tribulation he was released, but only in return for the
surrender of Damietta, and a ran- som of 500,000 livres (,800,000). When
Louis agreed to this enormous ransom, the sultan reduced it by a fifth,
and trusted the King for an unpaid half. 69 Louis led the remnant of his
army to Acre, and stayed there four years, vainly calling upon Europe to
cease its wars and join him in a new campaign. He dispatched the monk
William of Rubruquis to the Mongol Khan renew- ing the invitation of
Innocent — with similar results. In 1254 he returned to France.</p>
<p>His years in the East had quieted the factionalism of the Christians
there; his departure released it. From 1256 to 1260 a civil war of the
Venetians against the Genoese in the Syrian ports dragged every faction
into it, and exhausted the Christian forces in Palestine. Seizing the
opportunity, Bai- bars, the slave Sultan of Egypt, marched up the coast
and took one Christian town after another: Caesarea (1265), Safad
(1266), Jaffa (1267), Antioch (1268). The captured Christians were
slaughtered or enslaved, and Antioch was so devastated with plunder and
fire that it never recovered.</p>
<p>Roused to new fervor in his old age, Louis IX took the cross a second
time (1267). His three sons followed his example; but the French
nobility re- jected his plans as quixotic, and refused to join; even
Joinville, who loved him, would have none of this Eighth Crusade. This
time the King, wise in government and foolish in war, landed his
inadequate forces in Tunisia, hop- ing to convert its bey to
Christianity, and to attack Egypt from the west. He had hardly touched
African soil when he “fell sick of a flux in the stom -</p>

<p>ach,” 60 and died with the word “Jerusalem” on his lips ( 1 270) . A
year l ater Prince Edward of England landed at Acre, bravely led some
futile sallies, and hurried back to accept the English crown.</p>
<p>The final disaster came when some Christian adventurers robbed a
Moslem caravan in Syria, hanged nineteen Moslem merchants, and sacked
several Moslem towns. Sultan Khalil demanded satisfaction; receiving
none, he marched against Acre, the strongest Christian outpost in
Palestine; taking it after a siege of forty-three days, he allowed his
men to massacre or enslave 60,000 prisoners (1291). Tyre, Sidon, Haifa,
and Beirut fell soon afterward. The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem
maintained a ghostly existence for a time in the titles of vain
potentates, and for two centuries a few adventurers or en- thusiasts
embarked upon sporadic and futile efforts to resume the “Great Debate”;
but Europe knew that the Crusades had come to an end.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE RESULTS OF THE CRUSADES</li>
</ol>
<p>Of their direct and professed purposes the Crusades had failed. After
two centuries of war, Jerusalem was in the hands of the ferocious
Mamluks, and Christian pilgrims came fewer and more fearful than before.
The Moslem powers, once tolerant of religious diversity, had been made
intolerant by at- tack. The Palestinian and Syrian ports that had been
captured for Italian trade were without exception lost. Moslem
civilization had proved itself su- perior to the Christian in
refinement, comfort, education, and war. The mag- nificent effort of the
popes to give Europe peace through a common purpose had been shattere d
by nationalistic ambitions and the “crusades” of popes against
emperors.</p>
<p>Feudalism recovered with difficulty from its failure in the Crusades.
Suited to individualistic adventure and heroism within a narrow range,
it had not known how to adjust its methods to Oriental climates and
distant campaigns. It had bungled inexcusably the problem of supplies
along a lengthening line of communications. It had exhausted its
equipment, and blunted its spirit, by conquering not Moslem Jerusalem
but Christian Byzantium. To finance their expeditions to the East, many
knights had sold or mortgaged their properties to lord, moneylender,
Church, or king; for a price they had resigned their rights over many
towns in their domains; to many peasants they had sold re- mission of
future feudal dues. Serfs by the thousands had used the crusader’s
privilege to leave the land, and thousands had never returned to their
manors. While feudal wealth and arms were diverted to the East, the
power and wealth of the French monarchy rose as one of the major results
of the Cru- sades. At the same time both the Roman Empires were
weakened: the West- ern emperors lost prestige by their failures in the
Holy Land, and by their conflicts with a papacy exalted by the Crusades;
and the Eastern Empire,</p>
<p>6lO THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>though reborn in 1 261, never regained its former power or repute.
The Cru- sades, however, had this measure of success, that without them
the Turks would have taken Constantinople long before 1453. For Islam,
too, was weakened by the Crusades, and fell more easily before the
Mongol flood.</p>
<p>Some of the military orders suffered tragic fates. Those Hospitalers
who survived the massacre at Acre fled to Cyprus. In 1310 they captured
Rhodes from the Moslems, changed their name to the Knights of Rhodes,
and ruled the island till 1522; expelled then by the Turks, they removed
to Malta, be- came the Knights of Malta, and continued to exist there
till their disband- ment in 1799. The Teutonic Knights, after the fall
of Acre, transferred their headquarters to Marienburg in the Prussia
they had conquered for Germany from the Slavs. The Templars, driven from
Asia, reorganized in France. Pos- sessed of rich holdings throughout
Europe, they settled down to enjoy their revenues. Free from taxation,
they lent money at lower interest rates than the Lombards and the Jews,
and reaped lush profits. Unlike the Hospitalers, they maintained no
hospitals, established no schools, succored no poor. At last their
hoarded wealth, their armed state within the state, their
insubordination to the royal power, aroused the envy, fear, and wrath of
King Philip IV the Fair. On October 12, 1 3 10, by his order, and
without warning, all Templars in France were arrested, and the royal
seal was set on all their goods. Philip accused them of indulging
homosexual lusts, of having lost their Christian faith through long
contact with Islam, of denying Christ and spitting upon the cross, of
worshiping idols, of being in secret league with the Moslems, and of
having repeatedly betrayed the Christian cause. A tribunal of prelates
and monks loyal to the King examined the prisoners; they denied the
royal charges, and were put to the torture to induce them to confess.
Some, sus- pended by the wrists, were repeatedly drawn up and suddenly
let down; some had their bare feet held over flames; some had sharp
splinters driven under their fingernails; some had a tooth wrenched out
day after day; some had heavy weights hung from their genitals; some
were slowly starved. In many cases all these devices were used, so that
most of the prisoners, when examined again, were weak to the point of
death. One showed the bones that had fallen from his roasted feet. Many
of them confessed to all the charges of the King; some told how life and
liberty had been promised them, under the royal seal, if they would
admit the allegations of the government. Several of them died in jail;
some killed themselves; fifty-nine were burned at the stake (1310),
protesting their innocence to the end. Du Molay, the Grand Master of the
order, confessed under torture; led to the stake, he withdrew his con-
fession; and the inquisitors proposed to try him again. Philip denounced
the delay, and ordered him to be burned at once; and the royal presence
graced the execution. All the property of the Templars in France was
confiscated by the state. Pope Clement V protested against these
procedures; the French clergy supported the King; the Pope, a virtual
prisoner at Avignon, ceased</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>6 1 1</p>
<p>resistance, and abolished the order at Philip’s behest (1312). Edward
II, also needing money, confiscated the property of the Templars in
England. Some of the wealth so appropriated by Philip and Edward was
surrendered to the Church; some of it was granted by the kings to
favorites, who by these means founded great manors, and supported the
kings against the older feudal nobility.</p>
<p>Possibly some of the Crusaders had learned in the East a new
tolerance for sexual perversions; this, and the reintroduction of public
baths and private latrines in the West may be included among the results
of the Crusades. Probably through contact with the Moslem East, the
Europeans returned to the old Roman custom of shaving the beard. 61 A
thousand Arabic words now came into the European languages. Oriental
romances flowed into Europe, and found new dress in the nascent
vernaculars. Crusaders impressed by the enameled glass of the Saracens
may have brought from the East the technical secrets that led to the
improved stained glass of the developed Gothic cathe- drals. 62 The
compass, gunpowder, and printing were known in the East be- fore the
Crusades ended, and may have come to Europe in the backwash of that
tidal wave. Apparently the Crusaders were too unlettered to care for
“Arabic” poetry, science, or philosophy; Moslem influences in such
fields came rather through Spain and Sicily than through the contacts of
these wars. Greek cultural influences were felt by the West after the
capture of Constantinople; so William of Moerbeke, Flemish Archbishop of
Corinth, furnished Thomas Aquinas with translations of Aristotle made
directly from the original. In general the discovery, by the Crusaders,
that the followers of another faith could be as civilized, humane, and
trustworthy as themselves, if not more so, must have set some minds
adrift, and contributed to the weaken- ing of orthodox belief in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Historians like William, Archbishop
of Tyre, spoke of Moslem civilization with a re- spect, sometimes with
an admiration, that would have shocked the rude war- riors of the First
Crusade. 63</p>
<p>The power and prestige of the Roman Church were immensely enhanced by
the First Crusade, and progressively damaged by the rest. The sight of
diverse peoples, of lordly barons and proud knights, sometimes of
emperors and kings, uniting in a religious cause led by the Church
raised the status of the papacy. Papal legates entered every country and
diocese to stir recruiting and gather funds for the Crusades; their
authority encroached upon, often superseded, that of the hierarchy; and
through them the faithful became al- most directly tributory to the
pope. The collections so made became cus- tomary, and were soon applied
to many purposes besides the Crusades; the pope acquired, to the active
dissatisfaction of the kings, the power to tax their subjects, and
divert to Rome great sums that might have gone to royal co ffers or
local needs. The distribution of indulgences for forty days’ service in
Palestine was a legitimate application of military science; the granting
of</p>
<p>6 12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>similar indulgences to those who paid the expenses of a Crusader
seemed for- givable; the extension of like indulgences to those who
contributed to funds managed by the popes, or who fought papal wars in
Europe against Fred- erick, Manfred, or Conrad, became an added source
of irritation to the kings, and of humor to the satirists. In 1 241
Gregory IX directed his legate in Hun- gary to commute for a money
payment the vows of persons pledged to a crusade, and used the proceeds
to help finance his life-and-death struggle with Frederick II. 64
Provencal troubadours criticized the Church for divert- ing aid from
Palestine by offering equal indulgences for a crusade against the
Albigensian heretics in France. 65 “The faithful wondered,” says
Matthew</p>
<p>Next to the weakening of Christian belief, the chief effect of the
Crusades was to stimulate the secular life of Europe by acquaintance
with Moslem commerce and industry. War does one good — it teaches people
geography. The Italian merchants who throve on the Crusades learned to
make good charts of the Mediterranean; the monkish chroniclers who
accompanied the knights received and transmitted a new conception of the
vastness and va- riety of Asia. The zest for exploration and travel was
stirred; and Baedekers appeared to guide pilgrims to and through the
Holy Land. Christian physi- cians learned from Jewish and Moslem
practitioners, and surgery profited from the Crusades.</p>
<p>Trade followed the cross, and perhaps the cross was guided by trade.
The knights lost Palestine, but the Italian merchant fleets won control
of the Mediterranean not only from Islam but from Byzantium as well.
Venice, Genoa, Pisa, Amalfi, Marseille, Barcelona had already traded
with the Mos- lem East, the Bosporus, and the Black Sea; but this
traffic was immensely en- larged by the Crusades. The Venetian conquest
of Constantinople, the trans- port of pilgrims and warriors to
Palestine, the purveyance of supplies to Christians and others in the
East, the importation of Oriental products into Europe — all these
supported a degree of commerce and maritime transport unknown since the
most flourishing days of Imperial Rome. Silks, sugar,</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>613</p>
<p>spices — pepper, ginger, cloves, cinnamon — rare luxuries in
eleventh-century Europe — came to it now in delightful abundance.
Plants, crops, and trees al- ready known to Europe from Moslem Spain
were now more widely trans- planted from Orient to Occident — maize,
rice, sesame, carob, lemons, melons, peaches, apricots, cherries, dates
. . . shallot and scallion were named from the port, Ascalon, that
shipped them from the East to the West; and apricots were long known as
“Damascus plums .” 88 Damasks, muslins, satins, velvets, tapestries,
rugs, dyes, powders, scents, and gems came from Islam to adorn or
sweeten feudal and bourgeois homes and flesh . 69 Mirrors of glass
plated with metallic film now replaced those of polished bronze or
steel. Europe learned from the East to refine sugar, and make “Venetian”
glass.</p>
<p>New markets in the East developed Italian and Flemish industry, and
pro- moted the growth of towns and the middle class. Better techniques
of bank- ing were introduced from Byzantium and Islam; new forms and
instruments of credit appeared; more money circulated, more ideas, more
men. The Cru- sades had begun with an agricultural feudalism inspired by
German bar- barism crossed with religious sentiment; they ended with the
rise of industry, and the expansion of commerce, in an economic
revolution that heralded and financed the Renaissance.</p>
