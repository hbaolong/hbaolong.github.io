<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>Roman Law*</p>
<p>I46 B.C.-A.D. 192</p>
<p>I. THE GREAT JURISTS</p>
<p>1 AW was the most characteristic and lasting expression of the Roman
J spirit. As Greece stands in history for freedom, so Rome stands for
order; and as Greece bequeathed democracy and philosophy as the founda-
tions of individual liberty, so Rome has left us its laws, and its
traditions of administration, as the bases of social order. To unite
these diverse legacies, to attune their stimulating opposition into
harmony, is the elemental task of statesmanship.</p>
<p>Since law is the essence of Roman history it has been impossible to
keep them separate, and this chapter can only be a structural and
synoptic sup- plement to preceding and subsequent details. The Roman
constitution was like the British — no set of permanently binding rules,
but a stream of prece- dent giving direction without preventing change.
As wealth increased, and life became more complex, new legislation
issued from assemblies, Senate, magistrates, and princes; the body of
the law grew as rapidly as the Entire and reached out to ever new
frontiers. The education of lawyers, the guidance of judges, and the
protection of the citizen from illegal judg- ments demanded the
organization and formulation of the law into some orderly and accessible
form. Amid the turmoil of the Gracchan and Marian revolution Publius
Mucius Scaevola (consul, 133 b.c.) and his son Quintus (consul, 95 b.c.)
labored to reduce the laws of Rome to an intelligible system. Cicero,
pupil of another Quintus Mucius Scaevola (consul, 117 b.c.), wrote
eloquently on the philosophy of law, and constructed an ideal code
designed to preserve the fortune that he had gained and the faith that
he had lost. The contradictory enactments of Marius and Sulla, the un-
precedented powers of Pompey, the revolutionary legislation of Caesar,
and the new constitution of Augustus created fresh problems for minds
that struggled to make a logic of the law; and the brilliant jurist
Antistius Labeo confounded confusion by declaring the decrees of Caesar
and Augustus</p>
<p>• This chapter will be of no use to lawyers, and of no interest to
others.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>392 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>void, as the expression of usurped and illegal authority. Not till
the Princi- pate had -established itself, first by the use of force and
then by the force of use, could the new legislation win acceptance in
the minds of men as well as in the courts of power. To the second and
third centuries of our era belongs the honor of giving Roman law its
final formulation in the West — an achievement comparable to the
formulation of science and philos- ophy in Greece.</p>
<p>Here, too, Caesar had set the goal; but the actual work did not begin
till Hadrian (a.d. i 17). This best educated of the emperors gathered
about him a corps of jurists as his Privy Council, and commissioned them
to replace the variable annual edicts of the praetors with a Perpetual
Edict to be observed by all future judges in Italy. The Greeks had
produced since Solon no masterpiece of jurisprudence, and never a
codified system of law; but the Greek cities of Asia and Italy had
developed excellent municipal codes. The much-traveled Hadrian knew
these cities well and was perhaps inspired by their constitutions to
improve and co-ordinate the laws of Rome. Under his successors, the
Antonines, the work of codification continued, and the half-official
repute enjoyed by the Stoic philosophy permitted a profound Greek
influence upon Roman law. The Stoics declared that law should ac- cord
with morality, and that guilt lay in the intention of the deed, not in
the results. Antoninus, a product of the Stoic school, decreed that
cases of doubt should be resolved in favor of the accused, and that a
man should be held innocent until proved guilty ’-two supreme principles
of civilized law. Favored by imperial patronage, the science of
jurisprudence nurtured a succession of geniuses. Salvius Julianus, a
Roman of African birth, showed so much learning and industry as quaestor
August}, or legal adviser to the emperor, that the Senate voted him
double the usual salary of that office. His responsa were acclaimed for
their logic and clarity; his Digesta pre- sented a systematic
arrangement of civil and praetorian law; it was he who, as the leading
member of Hadrian’s Council, formulated the Praetorian</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>ROMAN LAW</p>
<p>393</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SOURCES OF THE LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>As the terminology of science and philosophy comes mostly from the
Greek, betraying their source, so the language of the law comes mostly
from the Latin. Law in general was ius , justice or right; lex meant a
specific law.* Jurisprudence- wisdom in the law — was defined in the
Digest of Justinian (a.d. 533) as both a science and an art: the
“science of the just and the unjust,” and the “art 〔i.e.,
administration〕 of the good and the equitable.” 2 Ius included
unwritten law, or custom, as well as written law. The latter was
composed of ius civile — the “law of 〔Roman〕 citizens”— and ius
gentium — ’the law of the nations.” Civil law was “public law” when it
related to the state or the official worship, and “private law” when it
dealt with the legal interrelations of the citizens.</p>
<p>Roman law as a whole flowed from five sources. 1. Under the Republic
the ultimate source of law was the will of the citizens, expressed as
leges in the Curial and Centurial Assemblies, and as plebiscita
(“decided by the plebs”) in the Tribal Assembly. The Senate acknowledged
leges only when they had been pro- posed to the assemblies with the
proper formalities and by a magistrate of Senatorial rank. When Senate
and assembly agreed in passing a measure, it was proclaimed in the name
of Senatus Populusque Romanus.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The Senate itself, in theory, had no lawmaking power under the
Republic; its senatusconsulta were, formally, recommendations to the
magistrates; gradu- ally they became directives, then imperatives, until
in the later Republic and under the Empire they took on the force of
laws. Altogether the laws passed by the assemblies or the Senate were so
few in the course of six centuries as to astonish one accustomed to the
legislative flux of modem states.</p></li>
<li><p>The need for minor or more specific laws was met by the edicta of
the municipal officials. Each new urban praetor (our “chief city
magistrate”) issued an e dictum praetorium y announced by a herald in
the Forum and inscribed upon a wall, and stating the legal principles on
which the praetor proposed to act and judge during his year’s term.
Similar edicts could be put forth by circuit judges ( praetores
peregrini) and provincial praetors. Through their power of im- perium ,
or rule, the praetors were allowed not only to interpret existing laws,
but to make new ones. In this way Roman law combined the stability of
its basic legislation with the flexibility of praetorian judgments. When
a law or clause was carried down from one praetorian edict to the next
for many years, it be- came a definite part of the ius honorarium; by
the time of Cicero this “law of the</p></li>

<p>• Cf. French droit and /&lt;?/, German Recbt and Gesetz.</p>
<p>394 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>to unify all preceding ius honorarium in a Perpetual Edict alterable
only by the emperor.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>The constitutiones principum , or statutes of the princes, became
themselves in the second century a varied source of law. They took four
forms. ( a ) The prince issued edicta by virtue of his imperium as an
official of the city; these were valid for the whole Empire, but
apparently lapsed after his death. ( b ) His decretals a judge, like
those of other magistrates, had the force of law. (c) Im- perial
rescripta were his answers to inquiries. Usually they were epistulae —
letters —or subset iptiones , brief replies “written under” a question
or petition. The wise and pithy letters in which Trajan answered the
requests of governmental ap- pointees for instruction were incorporated
into the laws of the Empire and kept their validity long after his
death. ( d ) The mandata of the emperors were their directives to
officials; in the course of time these came to constitute a detailed
code of administrative law.</p></li>
<li><p>Under certain circumstances law could be created by the responsa
pru - dentium . It must have been a pleasant sight when learned jurists
sat in chairs in the open Forum (or, in later decades, in their homes),
and gave legal opinions to all who asked, taking their chances on some
indirect remuneration. Often their advice was solicited by lawyers or
municipal judges. Like the great rabbis of the Jews they reconciled
contradictions, drew subtle distinctions, interpreted and adjusted the
ancient law to the needs of life or the exigencies of politics. Their
written replies, by unwritten custom, had an authority only less than
the law’s. Augustus gave such opinions full legal force on two
conditions; that the jurist should have received from the Emperor the
ills respondendi y or right of giving legal opinions; and that the reply
should be sent under seal to the judge trying the case in point. By the
time of Justinian these responsa had become a vast school and literature
of law, the fountain and foundation of his culminating Digest and Code
.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE LAW OF PERSONS</li>
</ol>
<p>“All law,” says the precise Gaius, “pertains to persons, to property,
or to procedure.” a The word persona had signified an actor’s mask;
later it was applied to the part played by a man in life; finally it
came to mean the man himself — as if to say that we can never know a
man, but only the parts he plays, the mask or masks that he wears.</p>
<p>The first person in Roman law was the citizen. He was defined as any-
one who had been accepted into a Roman tribe by birth, adoption, emanci-
pation, or governmental grant. Within this franchise were three grades:
(1) full citizens, who enjoyed the fourfold right of voting {ins
suffragii ), of holding office {ins hononnn ), of marriage with a
freeborn person {ins</p>
<p>ROMAN LAW</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>connubii), and of engaging in commercial contracts protected by Roman
law (ins coimnercii ); (2) “citizens without suffrage,” who had the
rights of marriage and contract, but not of voting or office; and (3)
freedmen, who had the rights of voting and contract, but not of marriage
or office. The full citizen had, furthermore, certain exclusive rights
in private law: the power of the father over his children (patria
potestas), of the husband over his wife (nianus), of an owner over his
property, including his slaves ( 1 dominium ), and of a freeman over
another by contract (mancipium) . A kind of potential citizenship,
called Latinitas or ins Latii, was conferred by Rome upon the free
inhabitants of favored towns and colonies, whereby they acquired the
right of contract, but not of intermarriage, with Romans, and their
magistrates received full Roman citizenship upon completing their terms
of office. Each city of the Empire had its own citizens and condi- tions
of citizenship; and by a unique tolerance a man might be a citizen — and
enjoy the civic rights — of several cities at once. The most precious
privi- lege of a Roman citizen was the safeguarding of his person,
property, and rights by the law, and his immunity from torture or
violence in the trying of his case. It was the glory of Roman law that
it protected the individual against the state.</p>
<p>The second person in Roman law was the father. The patria potestas
had been weakened by the spread of law into areas formerly governed by
custom; but we may judge its surviving force from the fact that when
Aulus Fulvius set out to join Catiline’s army, his f ather called him
back and put him to death. In general, however, the power of the father
declined as that of the government rose; democracy entered the family
when it left the state. In the early Republic the fathers had been the
state; the family heads formed the Curial Assembly, and the clan heads
probably constituted the Senate. Rule through family and clan diminished
as population became more abundant and diverse, and life more mobile,
commercial, and complex; kinship, status, and custom were replaced by
contract and law. 4 Children won greater freedom from their parents,
wives from their husbands, indi- viduals from their groups. Trajan
compelled a father to emancipate a son whom he had maltreated; Hadrian
took from the father the right of life and death over his household and
transferred it to the courts; Antoninus forbade a father to sell his
children into slavery. 6 Custom had long since reduced the use of these
old powers to rare occurrences. Law tends to lag behind moral
development, not because law cannot learn, but because ex- perience has
shown the wisdom of testing new ways in practice before con- gealing
them into law.</p>
<p>The Roman woman gained new rights as the man lost old ones; but she
was clever enough to disguise her freedom under continuing legal
disa-</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>396</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>bilities. The law of the Republic assumed that she was never sui
iuris, “of her own right,” but always dependent upon some male guardian;
“according to our ancestors,” said Gaius, “even women of mature age must
be kept in tutelage because of the lightness of their minds.” 0 In the
later Republic and under the Empire this legal dependence was largely
annulled by femi- nine charms and willfulness, abetted by male
susceptibility and affection. From Cato the Elder to Commodus Roman
society, legally patriarchal, was ruled by women, with all the graceful
mastery of Renaissance Italian or Bourbon French salons. The laws of
Augustus made some obeisance to the facts by releasing from tutela any
woman who had borne three legitimate children. 7 Hadrian decreed that
women might dispose of their property as they liked, provided they
obtained the consent of their guardians; but actual procedure soon
dispensed with this consent. By the end of the second cen- tury all
compulsory tutelage was ended in law for free women over</p>
<p>twenty-five.</p>
<p>The consent of both fathers was still required for legal marriage. 8
Mar- riage by confarreatio was now (a.d. 160) confined to a few
Senatorial families. Marriage by purchase ( coemptio ) lingered as a
form; the bride- groom paid for the bride by weighing an as or an ingot
of bronze in a scale before five witnesses, her father or her guardian
having consented. 9 Most marriages were now by usns, i.e., cohabitation.
To avoid falling under the manus or proprietory power of her husband,
the wife absented herself three nights in each year; thereby she
retained control of her property, excepting her dowry. Indeed, the
husband often put his property in his wife’s name to avoid suits for
damages or the penalties of bankruptcy. 10 Such marriage sine manu could
be ended by either party at will; marriage by other forms could be ended
only by the husband. Adultery was still a minor offense in the man; in
the woman it was a major offense against the institutions of property
and inheritance. But the husband no longer had the right to kill his
wife taken in adultery; this right was now vested tech- nically in her
father, actually in the courts; and the penalty was banishment.
Concubinage was recognized by the law as a substitute for marriage, but
not as an accompaniment to it; and a man could not legally have two
concubines at once. Children by a concubine were classed as illegitimate
and could not inherit — which made concubinage all the more attractive
to men who liked to be courted by hunters of legacies. Vespasian,
Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius lived in concubinage after the death
of their wives. 11</p>
<p>The law struggled to encourage parentage among the freeborn, but with
negligible results. Infanticide was forbidden except in the case of
infants deformed or incurably diseased. The detected procurer of
abortion was banished and lost part of his property; if the woman died
he was to be put</p>
<p>ROMAN LAW</p>
<p>chap, xvm)</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>to death; 12 these laws, of course, were largely evaded then as now.
Children of any age remained under the authority of the father except
when thrice sold by him into bondage, or when formally emancipated, or
when the son held a public office or became a fUanen dialis , or when a
daughter married cum manu or became a Vestal Virgin. If a son married in
the lifetime of his father, the patria potestas over
thegrandchildrearesided in the grandfather. 18 By the legislation of
Augustus the earnings of a son in the army, in public office, in
priestly orders, or in the liberal professions were freed from the old
rule that such gains belonged to the father. A son might still be sold
into bondage ( mancipium ) ; but this differed from slavery ( servitus )
in leav- ing the bondsman with his former civic rights.</p>
<p>The slave had no legal rights whatever; indeed, Roman law hesitated
to apply the term persona to him and compromised by calling him an
“imper - sonal man.” 14 It i s only by a considerate error that Gaius
discusses him under the law of persons; logically the slave came under
the rubric of prop- erty ires ) . He could not own, inherit, or
bequeath; he could not make a legal marriage; his children were all
classed as illegitimate, and the children of a slave woman were classed
as slaves even if the father was free. 15 Slaves male or female might be
seduced by their master without legal redress. The slave could not bring
action in the courts against those who injured him; he could proceed in
such a case only through his owner. The latter, under the law of the
Republic, could beat him, imprison him, condemn him to fight beasts in
the arena, expose him to die of starvation, or kill him, with cause or
without, and with no other control than a public opinion formed by
slaveowners. If a slave ran away and was caught he could be branded or
crucified; Augustus boasted that he had recaptured 30,000 runaway slaves
and had crucified all who had not been claimed. 18 If, under these or
other provocations, a slave killed his master, law required that all the
slaves of the murdered man should be put to death. When Pedanius
Secundus, urban prefect, was so slain (a.d. 61), and his 400 slaves were
condemned to die, a minority in the Senate protested, and an angry crowd
in the streets de- manded mercy; but the Senate ordered the law to be
carried out, in the belief that only by such measures could a master be
secure. 17</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the Empire — or perhaps of the diminishing
supply of slaves — that their condition was progressively improved under
the emperors. Claudius prohibited the killing of a useless slave and
ruled that an abandoned sick slave who recovered should become
automatically free. The lex Petronia, probably under Nero, forbade
owners, without a magistrate’s approval, to condemn slaves to fight in
the arena. Nero allowed maltreated slaves to use his statue as an asylum
and appointed a judge to hear their complaints — a modest advance that
seemed revolutionary to Rome, since it opened the</p>
<p>398 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>courts to slaves. Domitian made it a criminal offense to mutilate
slaves for sensual purposes. Hadrian ended the right of the owner to
kill a slave with- out magisterial sanction. Antoninus Pius permitted an
abused slave to take sanctuary in any temple and had him sold to another
master if he could prove injury. Marcus Aurelius encouraged owners to
bring before the courts, rather than themselves punish, damages
sustained by them from their slaves; in this way, he hoped, law and
judgment would gradually re- place brutality and private revenge . 18
Finally a great jurist of the third cen- tury, Ulpian, proclaimed what
only a few philosophers had dared suggest — that “by the law of Nature
all men are equal.” 19 Other jurists laid it down as a maxim that where
the freedom or slavery of a man was in question, all doubts should favor
liberty . 20</p>
<p>Despite these mitigations, the legal subjection of slaves is the
worst blot on Roman law. The last indignity was the tax and restrictions
upon emanci- pation. Many owners evaded the lex Fufia Canina by
informally freeing a slave without official witness or legal ceremony;
such liberation, however, conferred not citizenship but only Latinitas.
The slave freed by process of law became a citizen with limited civic
rights; but custom required him to pay his respects to his former owner
every morning, attend him when needed, vote for him at every
opportunity, and, in some cases, pay him a portion of all money earned.
If the freedman died intestate, his property went automatically to his
living patron; if he made a will he was expected to leave him a part of
his estate . 21 Only when the master was dead, dutifully mourned, and
safely buried could the freedman really breathe the air of freedom.</p>
<p>To these general divisions of the law of persons must be added the
legisla- tion which in modem codes is separately known as criminal law.
Roman jurisprudence recognized crimes against the individual, the state,
and social or business groups considered as juridical persons. Against
the state one might be guilty of maiestas, treason by act or word; vis
publica, sedition; sacrilegmm , offenses against the state religion;
ambitus, bribery; crimen repetundarum, extortion or corruption in public
administration; peculatus, embezzlement of state funds; and corruptio
judicis, bribery of a judge or juryman; from this partial list we may
see that corruption has an ancient pedigree and a probable future.
Against the individual one could commit tniuria, physical injury;
falsum, deception; stuprum, indecency; and caedes, murder. Cicero
mentions a lex Scantinia against pederasty ; 22 Augustus cor- rected the
error with a fine, Martial with epigrams, Domitian with death. Personal
injury was no longer punished with equivalent retaliation, as in the
Twelve Tables, but by a fine. Suicide was no crime; on the contrary,
before</p>

<p>Domitian, it was in some sense rewarded; a man condemned to death
could usually, by suicide, ensure the validation of his will and the
unimpeded trans - mission of his property to his heirs. The law left the
last choice free.</p>

<p>Problems of ownership, obligation, exchange, contract, and debt took
up by far the largest part of Roman law. Material possession was the
very life of Rome, and the increase of wealth and the expansion of trade
demanded a body of law immeasurably more complex than the simple code of
the Decemvirs.</p>
<p>Ownership ( dominium ) came by inheritance or acquisition. Since the
father owned as agent and trustee of the family, the children and
grandchildren were potential owners — sui heredes in the law’s queer
phrase— “their own heirs.” 23 If the father died intestate they
succeeded automatically to the family property, and the oldest father
among the sons inherited the dominium . The making of valid wills was
hedged about with hundreds of legal restrictions, and their com-
position required, as now, a gorgeous and sonorous tautology. Every
testator was compelled to leave a specified portion of his estate to his
children, another part to a wife who had borne him three children, and
(in some cases) parts to his brothers, sisters, and ascendants. No heir
might take any part of an estate with- out assuming all the debts and
other legal obligations of the deceased; not infre- quently a Roman
found himself saddled with a dctmnosa hereditas — n legacy, so to speak,
in the red. Where an owner died without children and without a will, his
property and his debts passed automatically to the nearest “agnate,” or
relative descended from a common ancestor exclusively through males. In
the later Em- pire this male conceit abated, and by the time of
Justinian agnates and cognates (relatives .through male or female lines
of ascent) inherited with equal right. An old law passed on the urging
of Cato (169 b.c.) had forbidden any Roman who owned 100,000 sesterces
(5,000) or more to bequeath any part of his estate to a woman. This lex
Voconia was still on the statute books in Gaius’ time, but love had
found a way. The testator left property on trust ( fxdeiccnmmsswn ) to a
qualified heir, and bound him by a solemn request to transfer the
property before a stated date to the woman named. By this and other
channels much of the wealth of Rome passed into the hands of women.
Gifts offered another escape from testamentary law; but gifts made in
prospect of death were subject to legal scrutiny, and under Justinian
they were liable to the same laws as those that harassed legacies.</p>
<p>Acquisition came by transfer, or by legal conveyance resulting from a
suit at law. Transfer {mancipation “taking in hand”) was a formal gift
or sale before witnesses and with scales struck by a copper ingot as
token of a sale; without this ancient ritual no exchange had the
sanction or protection of the law. An intermediate or potential
ownership was recognized under the name of possession</p>

<p>the right to hold or use property; e.g., tenants on state lands were
possessores (“sitters,” squatters), not domini; but their prescriptive
right ( usucapio , “taking</p>
<p>Obligation was any compulsion by law to the performance of an act. It
could arise by delict or by contract. Delicts or torts — noncontractual
wrongs committed against a person or his property — were in many cases
punished by an obligation to pay the injured person a sum of money in
compensation. A contract was an agreement enforceable at law. It did not
have to be written; indeed, until the second century a.d. the verbal
agreement made by uttering the word spondeo — “I promise”— before a
witness was considered more sacred than any written com- pact. The many
witnesses and solemn ceremony once required for legal contract were no
longer necessary; business was quickened by the legal recognition of any
clear agreement — usually entries made by the parties in their account
books (tabulae). But the law guarded transactions carefully: it warned
the seller with a caveat venditor y as well as the buyer with a caveat
e?nptor , against the myriad forms of cheating natural to civilized
life. Any seller of slaves or cattle, for ex- ample, was required by law
to disclose their physical defects to the purchaser and was held
accountable despite a plea of ignorance. 25</p>
<p>Debt was contracted by loan, mortgage, deposit, or trust. Loans for
consump- tion were usually secured by a mortgage on realty or movable
goods. A default in principal entitled the mortgagee to take over the
property. In early republican law, as we have seen, such default
permitted the lender to attach the person of the borrower as a
bondsman.* The lex Poetelia (326 b.c.) modified this rule by allow- ing
the debtor to work off his obligation while retaining his freedom. After
Caesar, defaulted mortgages were usual ly satisfied by the sale of the
debtor’s property without jeopardy to his person; but cases of
enslavement to a creditor occur as late as Justinian. Commercial
defaults were mitigated by a law of bank- ruptcy which sold the
bankrupt’s property to pay hi s debts, but permitted him to keep as much
of his later acquisitions as his subsistence required.</p>
<p>The chief crimes against property were damage, theft, and rapine —
theft with violence. The Twelve Tables had condemned a detected thief to
be flogged and then delivered as a bondsman to his victim; if the thief
was a slave he was to be scourged and flung from the Tarpeian rock.
Increased social security permitted praetorian law to soften these
severities to a twofold, threefold, or fourfold restitution. 20 In its
final form the law of property was the most perfect part of the Roman
code.</p>

<p>V. THE LAW OF PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Of all ancient peoples the Romans were the most prone to litigation,
despite the discouraging complexity, technicality, and confusing
fictions of their procedural law. Doubtless our own legal actions would
have seemed to them equally devious and prolonged. The older the
civilization, the longer the lawsuits. Any man, as noted above, could
make himself a prosecutor in a Roman court. In the patrician Republic
the accuser, the defendant, and the magistrate were required to follow a
form called legis actio , or process of law, and the slightest deviation
invalidated the action. “Thus,” says Gaius, “a man who sued another for
cutting his vines, and in his action called them ‘vines,’ lost his case
because he shoul d have called them ‘trees,’ since the Twelve Tables
speak generally of trees, and not particularly of vines.” 27 Each party
deposited with the magistrate a sum of money (sacra - Ttientum ), which
was forfeited by the losing party to the state religion. The defendant
also had to give bail ( vadimonium ) as security for his subsequent ap-
pearances. The magistrate then turned over the dispute to a person on
the list of those qualified to act as judges. In some cases the judge
issued an interim inter- dictum , requiring one or more of the parties
in the case to perform or refrain from certain actions. If the defendant
lost, his property — sometimes his person — could be seized by the
plaintiff until the judgment was satisfied.</p>
<p>About 150 b.c. the lex Aebutia abolished the necessity of using this
ritual legis actio , and accepted in its place a procedure per formulam.
Specific acts and words were no longer required; the parties shared with
the magistrate in determining the form under which the matter was to be
submitted to the judge; and the magistrate then wrote to the judge an
instruction (formula) on the factual and legal questions involved; it
was partly in this way that the praetor, as magistrate, made “praetorian
law.” In the second century a.d. a third mode of action — cognitio
extraordinaria — came into use: the magistrate decided the case himself.
By the end of the third century the formulary procedure had disappeared,
and the summary judgment of a magistrate responsible only to the
emperor, and usually owing his office to him, reflected the coming of
absolute monarchy.</p>
<p>The litigants could conduct their case, and the praetor or judge
decide it, without the help of lawyers if they wished; but as the index
was not often a professional trained in the law, and the litigants might
at every step stumble over a technicality, all parties to a dispute
usually sought the aid of trial lawyers (advocati) per legal technicians
(pragmatici ) , consultants (iurisconsulti ) , or jurists
(iurisprudentes ) . There was no lack of legal talent, for every fond
parent yearned to see his son an advocate, and the law, then as now, was
the vestibule to public office. A character in Petronius gives his son a
collection of red- backed books (codices) “to learn a little law,” as
“it spells money.” 28 A law student began by learning the elements from
some</p>
<p>402 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>private instructor; in his second stage he attended the consultations
of eminent jurists; thereafter he apprenticed himself to a practicing
lawyer. Early in the second century a.d. certain inrisconsulti set up in
various parts of Rome schools ( stationes ) at which they gave
instruction or advice in the law; Ammianus complains of their high fees,
saying that they charged even for their yawns and made matricide venial
if the client paid enough. 20 These teachers were called iuris civilis
professores; apparently the title of professor came from the fact that
they were required by law to declare (profiteri) their intention of
teaching, and to secure a license therefor from the public authority.
80</p>
<p>Out of the many lawyers so trained there were inevitably some who
sold their learning to sordid causes, 31 accepted bribes to present
their client’s case weakly, 32 found loopholes in the law for any crime,
fomented disputes among rich men, dragged on suits to any lucrative
length, 33 and shook the courts or the Forum with their intimidating
questioning and their vitupera- tive summations. Forced to compete for
cases, some lawyers sought to build a reputation by walking hurriedly
through the streets with bundles of documents in their hands, borrowed
rings on their fingers, dependents at- tending them, and hired claqueurs
to applaud their speech. 34 So many ways had been found of circumventing
the old Cincian law against fees that Claudius legalized them up to
10,000 sesterces per case; any fee above this figure was to be
recoverable by law. 35 This restriction was easily evaded, for we hear
of a lawyer in Vespasian’s reign amassing a fortune of 300,000,- 000
sesterces (0,000,000). 30 As in every generation, there were attorneys
and judges whose clear and disciplined minds were at the service of
truth and justice regardless of fee; and the lowest practitioners were
redeemed by the great jurists whose names are the highest in the history
of the law.</p>
<p>Courts for the trial of offenders varied from the hearings held by
indi- vidual judges or magistrates to the assemblies, the Senate, and
the emperor. Instead of a single judge the praetor might choose by lot
(subject to a number of challenges by accuser and defendant) a jury of
almost any size, usually fifty-one or seventy-five, from the 850
Senatorial or equestrian names on the jury list. Two special courts were
permanently maintained: the decemviri, or Ten Men, to try cases of civil
status; and the centumviri, or Hundred Men, to hear suits in property
and bequest. The proceedings of these bodies were open to the public,
for the younger Pliny describes the great crowd that came to hear him
address the larger court. 37 Juvenal 38 and Apuleius 80 complain of
judicial procrastination and venality, but their very indignation
suggests exceptional cases.</p>
<p>Trials were marked by a freedom of speech and action seldom known in
modem courts. Several lawyers might appear on each side; some
specialized</p>
<p>ROMAN LAW</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>403</p>
<p>in preparing the evidence, some in presenting it. The proceedings
were re- corded by various clerks (notarii, actuarii, scribae ) , and
were sometimes taken down in shorthand; Martial says of certain scribes,
“However fast the words may run, their hands are quicker still .” 41
Plutarch tells how stenographers took down the speeches of Cicero, often
to his discomfort. Witnesses were dealt with according to time-honored
precedents. Says the exemplary Quintilian:</p>
<p>In the examination of a witness the first essential is to know
his</p>
<p>type. For a timid witness may be terrorized, a fool outwitted, an</p>
<p>irascible man provoked, and vanity flattered. The shrewd and
self-</p>
<p>possessed witness must be dismissed at once as malicious and
obstinate; or … if his past life admits of criticism, his credit may be
over-</p>
<p>thrown by the scandalous charges that can be brought against him .
42</p>
<p>Almost any kind of argument might be made by the advocate. He could
show the court pictures of the alleged crime, painted on canvas or wood;
he could hold a child in his arms while arguing a point; he could bare
the scars of an accused soldier or the wounds of a client. Defenses were
con- trived against these weapons. Quintilian tells how one attorney,
when his opponent illustrated a summation by bringing his client’s
children into court, threw dice among them; the children scrambled for
the tesserae and ruined a peroration . 43 The slaves of either party to
a suit might be tortured to elicit evidence, but such evidence was not
admissible against their owners. Hadrian decreed that slaves should be
tortured for evidence only as a last resort and under the strictest
regulations, and he warned the courts that evidence secured by torture
could never be trusted. Legal torture neverthe- less persisted, and was
extended in the third century to freemen . 44 The jury voted by
depositing marked tablets in an urn; a majority sufficed for a decision.
In most cases the loser might appeal to a higher court, and finally, if
he could afford it, to the emperor.</p>
<p>Penalties were fixed by law rather than left to the discretion of the
judge. They varied with the rank of the offender, being severest for the
slave; he might be crucified, the citizen might not; and no Roman
citizen, as every reader of the Acts of the Apostles knows, could be
scourged, tortured, or put to death over his appeal to the emperor.
Different penalties were laid upon honestiores and humiliores for the
same crime; they varied also accord- ing as the offender was freeborn or
freeman, solvent or bankrupt, soldier or civilian. The simplest
punishment was a fine. Since the value of currency changed more rapidly
than the penalties named in the law, certain anomalies ensued. The
Twelve Tables exacted a fine of twenty-five asses (originally
twenty-five pounds of copper) for striking a freeman; when rising
prices</p>
<p>404 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>had lowered the as to six cents Lucius Veratius went about striking
freemen in the face, followed by a slave who counted out twenty-five
asses to each victim . 45 Some offenses resulted in infamia
(“speechlessness”), chiefly the inability to appear, or be represented
by another, in an action at law. A more stringent punishment was loss of
civic rights ( capitis deminutio) , which took the progressive forms of
incapacity to inherit, deportation, and enslavement. Deportation was the
harshest form of exile: the condemned man was put in chains, confined in
some inhospitable place, and deprived of all his property. Exilium was
milder in allowing the victim to live in freedom wherever he pleased
outside of Italy; relegatio, as in the case of Ovid, involved no con-
fiscation, but compelled the outcast to stay in a specified town,
usually far from Rome. Imprisonment was seldom used as a permanent
punishment, but men might be condemned to menial labor on public works,
or in the mines, or in the quarries of the state. Under the Republic a
freeman sentenced to death could escape the penalty by leaving Rome or
Italy; under the Empire the death penalty was imposed with increasing
frequency and ruthlessness. Prisoners of war, and in some cases other
condemned men, might be thrown into the Career Tullianum, to die of
starvation, rodents, and lice in under- ground darkness and irremovable
filth . 46 There Jugurtha died, and Simon Ben-Giora, heroic defender of
Jerusalem against Titus. There, said tradition, Peter and Paul had
languished before their martyrdom, and had written their last addresses
to the young Christian world.</p>

<li>THE LAW OF THE NATIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>The most difficult problem of Roman law was to adjust itself as an
intelli- gent master to the varied codes and customs of the lands that
Roman arms or diplomacy had won. Many of these states were older than
Rome; what they had lost in military courage they made up in proud
traditions and a jealous fondness for their peculiar ways. Rome met the
situation ably. A praetor peregrinus was appointed at first for the
foreigners in Rome, then for Italy, then for the provinces; and power
was given him to make some viable union between Roman and local law. The
annual edicts of this praetor and the provincial governors and aediles
gradually created the ius gentium by which the Empire was ruled.</p>
<p>This “Law of the Nations” was not an international law— not a body of
commitments accepted by the generality of states as governing their
inter- relations. In a sense not much more tenuous than today there was
in antiquity an international law, insofar as certain common customs
were honored in peace and war — the mutual safeguarding of international
merchants and</p>
<p>ROMAN LAW</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>405</p>
<p>diplomats, the granting of truce for the burial of the dead,
abstention from the use of poisoned arrows, etc. The jurists of Rome, by
a patriotic fiction, described the ius gentium as law common to all
nations. But they were too modest about Rome’s part in it. Act ually it
was local law adapted to Roman sovereignty, and designed to govern the
peoples of Italy and the provinces without giving them Roman citizenship
and the other rights of the ius civile.</p>
<p>By a corresponding fiction the philosophers attempted to identify the
Law of the Nations with the “Law of Nature.” The Stoics defined the
latter</p>
<p>True law is right reason in agreement with nature, world-wide in</p>
<p>scope, unchanging, everlasting. . . . We may not oppose or alter</p>
<p>that law, we cannot abolish it, we cannot be freed from its
obligations by any legislature, and we need not look outside ourselves
for an ex- pounder of it. This law does not differ for Rome and for
Athens, for</p>
<p>the present and for the future; … it is and will be valid for all</p>
<p>nations and all times. … He who disobeys it denies himself and
his</p>
<p>own nature . 47</p>
<p>It was a perfect statement of an ideal that grew in force as Stoicism
reached the throne in the Antonines. Ulpian developed it into the
far-reaching prin- ciple that class distinctions and privileges are
accidental and artificial; and from this it was but a step to the
Christian conception of all men as funda- mentally equal. But when Gaius
defined the ius gentium as simply “the law which natural reason has
established among all mankind,” 48 he was mis - taking Roman arms for
Divine Providence. Roman law was the logic and economy of force; the
great codes of ius civile and ius gentium were the rules by which a wise
conqueror gave order, regularit y, and time’s sanctity to a sovereignty
based upon the legions’ strength. They were natural, but only in the
sense that it is natural for the strong to use and abuse the weak.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is something noble in this imposing architecture
of government called Roman law. Since the victor must rule, it is a boon
that the rules of his mastery should be clearly expressed; in this sense
law is the consistency of power. It was natural that the Romans should
create the greatest system of law in history: they loved order and had
the means to enforce it; upon the chaos of a hundred diverse nations
they laid an imperfect but sublime authority and peace. Other states had
had laws, and legislators like Hammurabi and Solon had issued small
bodies of humane legislation; but no people had yet achieved that
immense co-ordination, unification, and</p>
<p>40 6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>codification which occupied the highest legal minds of Rome from the
Scaevolas to Justinian.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the ius gentium facilitated the transmission of
Roman law to medieval and modern states. It was a happy accident that
while the chaos of barbarian invasion was mutilating the legal heritage
in the West, the Code, Digest, and Institutes of Justinian were
collected and formulated in Constantinople, in the comparative security
and continuity of the Empire in the East. Through those labors, and a
hundred lesser channels, and the silent tenacity of useful ways, Roman
law entered into the canon law of the medieval Church, inspired the
thinkers of the Renaissance, and became the basic law of Italy, Spain,
France, Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, even — within the British
Empire — of Scotland, Quebec, Ceylon, and South Africa. English law
itself, the only legal edifice of comparable scope, took its rules of
equity, admiralty, guardianship, and bequests from Roman canon law.
Greek science and philosophy, Judeo-Greek Christianity, Greco-Ro- man
democracy, Roman law — these are our supreme inheritance from the
ancient world.</p>
