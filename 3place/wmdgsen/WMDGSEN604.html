<h4 id="chapter-ix-the-mortal-realm">CHAPTER IX The Mortal Realm</h4>
<p>i 807 — 1 1</p>
<p>I. THE BONAPARTES</p>
<p>N APOLEON had increased his burdens by multiplying his possessions,
for the many regions that he had added to his empire differed in</p>
<p>“race,” language, religion, customs, and character; they could not be
ex - pected to give unquestioning obedience to a foreign rule that sent
their taxes to Paris and their sons to wars. Whom could he choose to
govern these prin- cipalities wisely and faithfully while he attended to
unmanageable France? He could trust a few of his generals to administer
some minor regions; so he made Berthier prince of Neuchatel, and Murat
grand duke of Berg and Cleves; but most of his generals were commanding
spirits untrained in the devious subtleties of government; and several
of them, like the ambitious Bernadotte, were jealous of his supremacy,
and would not be content with- out a throne.</p>
<p>So he turned to his own brothers as offering a blood bond of loyalty,
and as having some measure of that native force which had shared in
winning the consulate and the empire. He probably exaggerated their
abilities and poten- tialities, for he had a strong sense of family, and
did his best to meet their rising expectations of a share in his fortune
and power. He would reward them well, but would expect their cooperation
with his policies — especially in the enforcement of that Continental
Blockade through which he hoped to move England to peace. Perhaps, too,
their collaboration might be a step toward the union of all Europe under
one law and head (both of them his own), and so promote a general
prosperity and an end to dynastic or na- tionalistic wars.</p>
<p>He began with his older brother, Joseph, who had served him
reasonably well in negotiations with Austria and England. Cornwallis,
after dealing with Joseph at Amiens, described him as “a well -meaning,
although not a very able man,… sensible, modest, gentlemanlike,… fair
and open,… whose near connection with the First Consul might perhaps be
in some de- gree a check on the spirit of chicanery and intrigue which
the Minister of the Interior [Talleyrand] so eminently possesses.” 1
Joseph loved money as Napoleon loved power; as early as 1798 he had been
able to buy, at Morte- fontaine, near Paris, a sumptuous estate where he
entertained friends, au- thors, artists, and visiting dignitaries with
seignorial munificence. He itched</p>

<p>21 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xo have his brother name him heir apparent to the imperial power, and
he was not effusively satisfied when (March 30, 1806) Napoleon made him
king of Naples — i.e., of southern Italy. The dethroned Bourbon, Ferdi-
nand IV, clung to Sicily with the help of the British fleet, and his
Queen Maria Carolina led an insurrection to restore him to his mainland
throne. Napoleon sent forty thousand men, under Massena and Regnier, to
sup- press the revolt at whatever cost; they did so, with a ferocity
that left bitter memories for generations. Joseph tried to win the
loyalty of his subjects by a mild and genial government, but Napoleon
warned him that “a ruler, to establish himself, must make himself rather
feared than loved.” The final judgment was favorable:</p>
<p>Joseph rendered me no assistance, but he is a very good man…. He
loves me very sincerely, and I doubt not that he would do everything in
the world to serve me. But his qualities are only suited to private
life. He is of a gentle and kind disposition, possesses talent and
information, and is altogether a very amiable man. In the discharge of
the high duties which I confided to him he did the best he could. His
intentions were good; and therefore the principal fault rests with me,
who raised him above his proper sphere. 2</p>
<p>Brother Lucien, born in 1775, had in him all the volatile elements
that in Napoleon were controlled by a dominant ambition. In one sense
Napoleon owed him the Consulate, for it was the refusal of Lucien, as
president of the Five Hundred, to put to the vote the demand for
outlawing the usurper, and his appeal to the soldiery to disperse the
Council, that saved the day for Na- poleon. Later he was a bit premature
in proposing royal power for his brother, who removed him from the scene
by sending him as ambassador to Spain. There he used all available means
of swelling his private purse; soon, for a time, he was richer than
Napoleon. 3 Returning to Paris, he refused the political marriage that
Napoleon recommended to him, married his own choice, and went to live in
Italy. He came back to Paris to stand by his brother through all the
dangers of the Hundred Days. He was made for poetry and wrote a long
epic on Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Brother Louis too had a mind and temper of his own — combined with a
degree of ability and conviction that made him restless under his
brother’s dictation. Napoleon paid for his education, and took him to
Egypt as an aide-de- camp. There Louis used a soldier’s privilege to
contract gonorrhea and then proved too impatient to let himself be
completely cured. 4 In 1802, at Josephine’s urging, Napoleon induced the
reluctant L ouis to marry the re- luctant Hortense de Beauharnais. Louis
was a boorish husband, Hortense an unhappy and unfaithful wife, 5
somewhat spoiled by the affection she re- ceived from her adoptive
father. When she gave birth (December 15, 1802) to a boy,
Napoleon-Charles, gossip named the First Consul as the father; and this
unjust suspicion followed both Napoleon and Hortense to the end of their
days. Napoleon gave some warrant for it by proposing to adopt the child,
and by fondly calling him “our Dauphin,” or heir apparent to the throne;
6 but the boy died at the age of five. Hortense went temporarily in-</p>

<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>sane. In 1804 she gave birth to a second son, Napoleon-Louis, and in
1808 to Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, who became Napoleon III.</p>
<p>On June 5, 1 806, the Emperor made his difficult brother king of
Holland. Louis fell in love with the Dutch people more readily than with
his wife. He knew how much of Holland’s prosperity d epended upon its
trade with Eng- land and her colonies; and when the Dutch found ways of
violating the Continental Blockade against British goods, Louis refused
to prosecute them. Napoleon insisted, Louis persisted. French troops
marched into Holland; Louis abdicated (July 1, 1810); Napoleon annexed
Holland to France, bringing it under his direct rule. Louis retired to
Graz, became an author in prose and verse, and died at Livorno in 1
846.*</p>
<p>Hortense separated from Louis in 1810, and received from Napoleon an
endowment of two million francs per year for the care of her sons. To
these she added another in 1 8 1 1 as the result of a liaison with Comte
Charles de Flahaut; however, Mme. de Remusat tells us, Hortense was of
an “angelic disposition,… so true, so purehearted, so perfectly ignorant
of evil.” 8 After Napoleon’s first abdication she joined her mother at
Malmaison, where she received marked attention from Czar Alexander. She
dined with Louis XVIII, to the dismay of Bonapartists. When Napoleon
returned from Elba she acted as hostess for him. When he abdicated again
she secretly gave him a diamond necklace for which she had paid 800,000
francs; it was found under his pil- low when he died at St. Helena, and
was restored by General de Montholon to Hortense, who was thereby saved
from poverty. She died in 1837, and was buried beside the remains of her
mother in Rueil. 9 There were many lives in each life in those crucial
days.</p>
<p>Jerome Bonaparte, youngest of the brothers, divided his lives and
wives between two hemispheres. Born in 1784, called at sixteen to serve
in the Consular Guard, he fought a duel, was wounded, was banished to
the Navy, sowed wild oats, and paid for them by borrowing from
Bourrienne, who billed Napoleon for the unredeemed loans. When Jerome,
at Brest, asked for 17,000 francs, Napoleon wrote to him:</p>
<p>I have received your letter, Sir Ensign; and I am waiting to hear
that you are studying, on board your corvette, a profession which you
ought to consider your road to glory. Die young, and I shall have some
consolatory reflections; but if you live to sixty without having served
your country, and without leav- ing behind you any honorable memories,
you had better not have lived at all. 10</p>
<p>Jerome left the Navy in the West Indies, traveled to Baltimore, and
there in</p>
<ul>
<li>Napoleon, at St. Helena, gave his version to Las Cases: “No sooner
had Louis arrived in Holland than, fancying that nothing could be finer
than to have it said that henceforth he was a Dutchman, he attached
himself entirely to the party favorable to the English, pro- moted
smuggling, and thus connived with our enemies…. What remained for me to
do? Was I to abandon Holland to our enemies? Ought I to have given it
another king? But in that case could I have expected more from him than
from my own brother? Did not all the kings that I created act in nearly
the same manner? I therefore united Holland to the Empire; and this act
produced a most unfavorable impression in Europe, and contributed not a
little to… our misfortunes.” 7</li>
</ul>
<p>2 1 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>X1803, age nineteen, he married Elizabeth Patterson, daughter of a
local mer- chant. When he brought her to Europe a French court refused
to recognize the marriage, on the ground that both husband and wife were
minors, and Napoleon denied the wife entry into France. She went to
England, and there gave birth to a son, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte. She
returned to America, received an allowance from Napoleon, and became the
grand- mother of Charles Joseph Bonaparte, who served as Secretary of
the United States Navy under Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Jerome was given a command in the French Army, and distinguished
himself in the campaigns of 1806-07, capturing several Prussian
fortresses. Napoleon rewarded him by making him king of Westphalia — a
composite of areas taken from Prussia, Hanover, and Hesse-Cassel. To
give him a scent of royalty he secured for him in marriage Princess
Catherine, daughter of the King of Wiirttemberg. On November 15, 1807,
Napoleon sent to Jerome a letter in the best spirit of a still
constitutional ruler:</p>
<p>I enclose a constitution for your kingdom. It embodies the conditions
on which I renounce all my rights of conquest, and all the claims I have
acquired over your state. You must faithfully observe it…. Don’t listen
to those who say that your subjects are so accustomed to slavery that
they will feel no grati- tude for the benefits you give them. There is
more intelligence in the kingdom of Westphalia than they would have you
believe; and your throne will never be firmly established except upon
the trust and affection of the common peo- ple. What German opinion
impatiently demands is that men without heredi- tary rank, but of marked
ability, shall have an equal claim upon your favor and employment, and
that every trace of serfdom, or of a feudal hierarchy between the
sovereign and the lowest class of your subjects, shall be done away
with. The benefits of the Code Napoleon, public trial, and the introduc-
tion of juries, will be the leading features of your government…. For
the extension and consolidation of your reign I count more upon the
effects of these measures than upon the most resounding victories. I
want your subjects to enjoy a degree of liberty, equality, and
prosperity hitherto unknown to the German people…. Such a method of
government will be a stronger barrier between you and Prussia than the
Elbe, the fortresses, and the protection of France. 11</p>
<p>Jerome was still too young, at twenty-three, to appreciate this
advice. Lack- ing the self-control and sober judgment needed in
government, he indulged himself in every pomp and luxury, treated his
ministers as underlings, and adopted a foreign policy of his own, irking
a brother who had to think in terms of a continent. When Napoleon lost
the pivotal battle of Leipzig (1813) Jerome could not keep his
“subjects” loyal to the imperial cause; his kingdom collapsed, and
Jerome fled to France. He supported his brother bravely at Waterloo, and
then fled to his father-in- law’s protection in Wiirt - temberg. He
lived long enough to become a president of the Senate under his nephew
Napoleon III, and had the luck to die (i860) at the peak of another
mortal realm.</p>
<p>Eugene de Beauharnais was a better pupil. He was a lovable lad of
fifteen when his mother married Napoleon; he at first resented the
brusque young</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>2 19</p>
<p>general as an intruder, but soon warmed to Napoleon’s growing
affection and solicitude. He was flattered to be taken to Italy and
Egypt as aide-de- camp to the whirlwind conqueror; his sympathies were
divided between hus- band and wife when he learned of his mother’s
infidelity; his tears restored their union, and thereafter the bond of
loyalty between stepfather and stepson was never to be broken. On June
7, 1805, Napoleon made Eugene viceroy of Italy; but, seeing what a
responsibility he was placing upon a youth of twenty-four, he left him a
ream of advice.</p>
<p>By entrusting you with the government of Our Kingdom of Italy, we
have given you proof of the respect your conduct has inspired in us. But
you are still at an age when one does not realize the perversity of
men’s hearts; I can - not therefore too strongly recommend to you
prudence and circumspection. Our Italian subjects are more deceitful by
nature than the citizens of France. The only way in which you can keep
their respect and serve their happiness is by letting no one have your
complete confidence, and by never telling any- one what you really think
of the ministers and high officials of your court. Dissimulation, which
comes naturally at a maturer age, has to be emphasized and calculated at
yours….</p>
<p>In any position but that of Viceroy of Italy you may boast of being
a</p>
<p>Frenchman; but here you must forget it, and count yourself a failure
unless the Italians believe that you love them. They know that there is
no love with- out respect. Learn their language; frequent their society;
single them out for special attention at public functions….</p>
<p>The less you talk, the better; you aren’t well educated enough, and
you haven’t enough knowledge, to take part in formal debates. Learn to
listen, and remember that silence is oft en as effective as a display of
knowledge. Don’t imitate me in every respect; you need more reserve.
Don’t preside often over the State Council; you have too little
experience to do so successfully…. Any- how, never make a speech there;…
they would see at once that you aren’t competent to discuss business. So
long as a prince holds his tongue his power is incalculable; he should
never talk unless he knows he is the ablest man in the room….</p>
<p>One last word: punish dishonesty ruthlessly… , 12</p>
<p>Eugene fulfilled the Emperor’s expectations. With the help of his
minis - ters he reorganized finances, improved the civil service, built
roads, intro- duced the Code Napoleon, and led the Italian Army with his
usual courage and a growing skill. The pleased Emperor visited him in
1807, and took the occasion, by the “Milan Decree,” to respond, with
stringent regulations, to a British Order in Council requiring neutral
vessels to touch at an English port before proceeding to the Continent.
Eugene did his best to carry out the irritating Continental Blockade. He
remained loyal to Napoleon through all wars and abdications, and died
(1824) only three years after the death of his adoptive father. Sten
dhal’s Chartreuse de Parme repeatedly testifies to Italy’s loving memory
of his enlightened rule. 13</p>
<p>Having more lands than brothers, Napoleon endowed his sisters too
with terrain. Elisa (Maria Anna), with her complaisant husband Felice
Baccioc- chi, was given the principalities of Piombino and Lucca; these
she governed</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xso well — financing public works, patronizing literature and art,
encouraging Paganini — that in 1809 Napoleon made her grand duchess of
Tuscany, where</p>
<p>Pauline Bonaparte, whom Napoleon considered the most beautiful woman
of her time, found it unbearable to confine her charms to one bed. At
seven- teen (1797) she married General Charles Leclerc; four years later
— probably to distance her frivolity — Napoleon bade her accompany her
husband to St.- Domingue in the campaign against Toussaint L’Ouverture;
Leclerc died there of yellow fever; Pauline returned to Europe with his
corpse, and with her fabled beauty weakened by disease. In 1 803 she
married Prince Camillo Borghese, but she soon slipped into adultery, and
Camillo sought solace with a mistress. Napoleon asked his and her uncle,
Cardinal Fesch, to reprove her. “Tell her, from me, that she is no
longer as pretty as she was, and that in a few years’ time she will be
much less so, whereas she can be good and be respected all her life.” 14
Unchastened, Pauline separated from the Prin ce, and opened her lavish
home to the gayest society. Napoleon made her duchess of Guastalla (in
the province of Reggio Emilia in Italy), but she preferred to hold court
in Paris. Charmed by her looks and ways and good nature, he tolerated
her transgressions until, in a mirror, he saw her mocking his new
Empress, Marie Louise. He banished her to Italy; soon she ruled a salon
in Rome. Later on (as we shall see) she came to his aid in his
misfortunes. In 1825 she was reunited with her husband, and died in his
arms. “After all,” he had said, “she was the kindest creature in the
world.” 15</p>
<p>Caroline was almost as beautiful, and, in the final days, much more
dam- aging. We are told that her skin was like pink satin; “her arms,
hands, and feet were perfect, like those of all the Bonapartes.” At
seventeen (1799) she married Joachim Murat, who had already made his
mark in the Italian and Egyptian campaigns. For these services, and his
vital performance at Ma- rengo, he was made grand duke of Berg and
Cleves. While he was busy in his capital, Dusseldorf, Caroline remained
in Paris, and allowed such inti- macies to General Junot that Napoleon
sent him to Bordeaux. Murat re- turned to Paris to reclaim his wife, but
battle was his passion and danger was his hobby. In his frequent
absences at the front Caroline took over the ad- ministration of their
duchy, and managed so well that Murat was not missed except for his
gorgeous costumes.</p>
<p>Above all this lusty band of brothers and sisters sat their mother,
Letizia, firm, undeluded, and indestructible. She shared with fierce
pride and grim grief their triumphs and disasters. In 1806 Napoleon made
her, then fifty- six, the empress dowager, with an allowance of 500,000
francs per year. He</p>
<p>E rovided her with a handsome home in Paris and many servitors, but
she ved with her wonted frugality, saying that she was saving against a
crash in his fortunes. 16 She was addressed as Madame Mere, but had and
sought no political influence. She accompanied her son to Elba, and on
his return; she watched with anxiety and prayer the drama of the Hundred
Days. In 1818 she appealed to the Powers to release him from St. Helena
as a man now too ill to be dangerous to them; she received no reply. She
bore with her custom-</p>

<p>The family plan did not work, partly because it was not founded on
the needs of the peoples ruled, and partly because every one of the
rulers (ex- cept Eugene) was an individualist, with his own ideas and
desires — Napoleon most so. He thought of his own power first, and laid
down laws excellent as compared with a feudalism that had become
functionless; but he hedged and diluted them by financial and military
exactions. Though he was destroying feudalism, he was establishing
another of his own — thinking of his brothers and sisters as holding
fiefs of his giving, and therefore requiring them to be obedient
vassals, to raise conscripts for his needs in time of war, and taxes in
time of peace. He defended his conception of the situation by explaining
that nearly all the territories so governed had been conquered in wars
forced upon him by the Powers; therefore they were subject to the “laws”
of war, and they were lucky to get the up-to-date laws of France and the
paternal rule of an enlightened despot. As to his family, he summed up
the matter sadly in St. Helena:</p>
<p>It is very certain that I was poorly seconded by my family…. Much has
been said of the strength of my character, but I was reprehensibly weak
for my family, and they were well aware of it. After the first storm of
[my] re- sistance was over, their perseverance and stubbornness always
carried the day, and they did with me what they liked. I made great
mistakes in this. If each one of them had given a common impulse to the
masses I had entrusted to their rule, we could have marched together to
the Poles; everything would have fallen before us; we should have
changed the face of the globe. I did not have the good fortune of
Genghis Khan, with his four sons, who knew no other rivalry than that of
serving him faithfully. If I made a brother of mine a king, he at once
thought himself king “by the grace of God,” so contagious had this
phrase become. He was no longer a lieutenant in whom I could repose
confi- dence; he was one enemy more to beware of. His efforts did not
tend to sec- ond mine, but to make himself independent…. They actually
came to regard me as an obstacle…. Poor things! When I succumbed, their
dethronement was not exacted or even mentioned by the enemy [it was
automatic] ; and not one of them is capable now of exciting a popular
movement. Sheltered by my labor, they enjoyed the sweets of royalty; I
alone bore the burden. 17</p>
<p>Having conquered more principalities than he had princes and
princesses of his blood, Napoleon conferred strategic minor dependencies
upon his gen- erals or other servitors. So Marshal Berthier received the
province of Neu- chatel; Cambaceres became prince of Parma; Lebrun, duke
of Piacenza. From other regions of Italy a dozen minor duchies were cut;
Fouche became duke of Otranto, Savary of Rovigo. Ultimately, Napoleon
hoped he would join the disjecta membra of Italy into one state, and
make this a unit in a European Federation under the leadership of France
and his dynasty. If only all those units, so proud of their differences
and so jealous of their place, could sink these sustaining delusions in
some sense of the whole — and in some readiness to let a distant and
alien power write their laws and regulate their trade!</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<ol start="22" type="I">
<li>THE PENINSULAR WAR: I (OCTOBER 1 8 , 1 807- AUGUST 21, 1808)</li>
</ol>
<p>By 1807 almost all of mainland Europe was obeying the Berlin Decree.
Austria joined the Continental Blockade in October 18, 1807; the Papacy
protested but signed on December 12. Turkey was reluctant, but she might
be brought to obedience by the continued cooperation of Russia and
France. Portugal was allied with England, but she was bordered on the
west by a Spain historically bound to France by her Bourbon dynasty,
pledged to the blockade, and (it seemed) militarily at the mercy of
Napoleon. Perhaps, the Emperor mused, something could be done — if only
by marching through Spain — to bring Portugal to obedience despite
British warships controlling her ports and British agents controlling
her trade.</p>
<p>On July 19, 1807, Napoleon informed the Portuguese government that it
must close its ports to British goods. It refused. On October 18 a
French army of twenty thousand men, mostly unseasoned conscripts, under
An- doche Junot, crossed the Bidassoa into Spain. It was welcomed by the
people and the state, for the people were hoping that Napoleon would
free their King from a treacherous minister, and that minister was
hoping that Napo- leon would reward his cooperation by letting him share
in the dismember- ment of Portugal.</p>
<p>The brilliant epoch of the Spanish Enlightenment had ended with the
death of Charles III (1788). His now sixty-year-old son, Charles IV,
though rich in good intentions, was poor in vitality and intellect; in
Goya’s famous picture Charles IV and His Family the King is visibly
fonder of eating than of thinking, and Queen Maria Luisa is obviously
the man. But she was also a woman; and, not satisfied with her obedient
husband, she opened her arms to Manuel de Godoy, whom she raised from
officer of the Royal Guard to be chief minister. The Spanish people,
sexually the most moral in Europe, were scandalized by this liaison, but
Godoy, unchastened, dreamed of con- quering Portugal and of carving out
for himself, if not a kingdom, at least a duchy of his own. He angled
for Napoleon’s aid, and tried to forget that in 1 806 he had offered his
active friendship to a Prussia planning war against France. Napoleon
encouraged Godoy’s hopes, and signed at Fontainebleau (October 27, 1807)
an agreement for “the conquest and occupation of Portugal.” The nor
thwest, with Oporto, was to be an appanage of the Span- ish Queen; the
provinces of Algarve and Alentejo, in the south, were to be Godoy’s; the
central residue, with Lisbon, was to be under French control until
further notice. Article XIII of the treaty added: “It is understood that
the high contracting parties shall divide equally between themselves the
islands, colonies, and other maritime possessions of Portugal.” 18
Secret clauses stipulated that 8,000 Spanish infantry and 3,000 Spanish
cavalry were to join Junot’s army as it marched through Spain.</p>
<p>Unable to resist this combined force, the Portuguese royal family
took ship to Brazil. On November 30, Junot entered Lisbon, and the
conquest of</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>Portugal seemed complete. To pay for his operations he imposed upon
his new subjects an indemnity of 100 million francs. Partly to go to
Junot’s help in case of a British expedition to Portugal, and probably
with larger aims, Napoleon sent three additional armies into Spain, put
them under the united command of Murat, and bade him occupy some
strategic points near Madrid.</p>
<p>Discord in the Spanish government played into Napoleon’s hands. The
twenty-three-year-old Infante, or heir apparent, Ferdinand, fearing that
Godoy would bar his way to the throne, lent himself to a plot to
overthrow the favorite. Godoy discovered the scheme, had Ferdinand and
his chief supporters arrested (October 27), and proposed to have them
tried for trea- son. Two months later, having learned that the
approaching Murat might seek to release the prisoners, Godoy freed them,
and prepared to escape to America with the King and the Queen. Thereupon
the city populace rose in revolt (March 17, 1808), captured Godoy, and
threw him into a dungeon. The bewildered King resigned in favor of his
son. On orders from Napoleon, Murat led French troops into Madrid (March
23), liberated Godoy, and re- fused to recognize Ferdinand as king.
Charles rescinded his abdication, and confusion reigned. Talleyrand
urged Napoleon to take the throne of Spain. 19</p>
<p>Napoleon seized — perhaps had created — this opportunity. He invited
both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to meet him at Bayonne (some twenty
miles north of the Spanish-French frontier), with a view to restoring
order and stability to the government. The Emperor arrived on April 14,
Ferdinand on April 20. Napoleon entertained the youth and his adviser,
Canon Juan Escoiquiz, for dinner, and judged the youth too immature,
emotionally and intellectually, to hold popular passions in leash and
keep Spain in helpful league with France. He revealed this conclusion to
Escoiquiz, who reluc- tantly conveyed it to Ferdinand. The Infante
protested that he held the crown by his father’s abdication. He sent
couriers to Madrid to tell his sup - porters that he was helpless before
the power of Napoleon. These couriers were intercepted, and their
dispatches were brought to the Emperor; never- theless the news of
Ferdinand’s situation reached the capital. Popular sus - picion that
Napoleon intended to end the Bourbon dynasty in Spain was heightened
when news spread that Charles IV, the Queen, and Godoy had reached
Bayonne on April 30, and that Murat, now ruling Madrid, had re- ceived
orders to send the King’s brother, younger son, and daughter to Bayonne.
On May 2, 1808 — a date long celebrated in Spanish history as the Dos de
Mayo — an angry crowd gathered before the royal palace, tried to prevent
the princes and princess from leaving, and stoned the French sol- diers
who were guarding the royal coach; some of these soldiers, we are told,
were torn to pieces. Murat bade his troops fire upon the mob till it
dis- persed. It was so done, in a scene powerfully commemorated by Goya.
The insurrection subsided in Madrid, and spread through Spain.</p>
<p>When the report of this outbreak reached Napoleon at Bayonne (May 5),
he summoned both Charles and Ferdinand to his presence, and, in one of
his calculated rages, condemned them for allowing Spain, by their
incom-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xpetence, to fall into a disorder that made it dangerously unreliable
as an ally of France. Father and mother heaped reproaches and abuse upon
their son, accusing him of having contemplated parricide. Napoleon gave
the frightened youth till eleven o’clock that evening to abdicate; if he
refused, he would be turned over to his parents for imprisonment and
trial for treason. Ferdinand yielded, and restored the crown to his
father. Charles, longing for security and peace rather than for power,
offered the scepter to Napoleon, who offered it to his brother Lows, who
refused it, then to Jerome, who felt not quite up to so dangerous a
post, and finally to Joseph, who was in effect commanded to accept it.
Charles, Maria Luisa, and Godoy were sent to live in guarded ease at
Marseilles. Ferdinand and his brother were soothed with ample revenue,
and Talleyrand was commissioned to house them comfortably and securely
in his chateau at Valengay. Then, feel- ing that he had made a good
bargain, Napoleon rode leisurely back to Paris, acclaimed at every step
as the invincible master of Europe.</p>
<p>Murat, who had hoped to be king of Spain, went resentfully to replace
Joseph as king of Naples. Joseph, after a stop at Bayonne, entered
Madrid on June io, 1808. He had become habituated to Naples, and soon
missed, in stern and pious Spain, the joy of life that in Italy
moderated the general flammability of the south Italian soul. He brought
to Spain a semiliberal con- stitution hastily contrived by Napoleon,
offering much of the Code Napo- leon, but (as Charles IV had insisted)
accepting Catholicism as the only legal religion in Spain. Joseph tried
hard to be a popular ruler, and many Spanish liberals supported him; but
the nobility held aloof, the clergy condemned him as a secret
freethinker, and the populace was shocked to find that Napo- leon had
replaced their Church-blessed dynasty with a man who knew hardly a word
of Spanish, and utterly lacked the charisma of time.</p>
<p>Slowly, then rapidly, the resentment grew from scowls to imprecations
to revolt. Peasant bands arose in a hundred localities; armed themselves
with the old weapons and sharp knives that had made every home an
arsenal and every cloak a snare; and took as target any Frenchman who
strayed from his barracks or squad. Against French carbines the Spanish
clergy raised the cross; they denounced Joseph as “a Lutheran, a
Freemason, a heretic,” and summoned their flocks to insurrection “in the
name of God, His Immaculate Mother, and Saint Joseph.” 20 Po pular
enthusiasm boiled over, leading to such amputations, castrations,
crucifixions, beheadings, hangings, and impalings as Goya pictured in
Los Desastres de la Guerra. Spanish armies re-formed and joined the
uprising; their united battalions overcame scattered and under- manned
French garrisons; their leaders sometimes outgeneraled French offi- cers
handicapped by unfamiliarity with the terrain and the inadequate number,
equipment, and training of their troops. At Bailen (northeast of
Cordoba), on July 20, 1808, two French divisions, mistakenly supposing
themselves surrounded by greatly superior forces, surrendered in one of
the most ignominious defeats in history: 22,800 men were made prisoners
and were interned on the little island of Cabrera, where hundreds of
them died of starvation or disease. Shorn of his chief military support,
Joseph and his</p>

<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>remaining soldiers withdrew from Madrid to a line of defense along
the Ebro, 170 miles northeast of the capital.</p>
<p>In the meantime the English government, confident that Junot’s dimin
- ishing forces in Lisbon could no longer be reinforced from Spain, sent
Sir Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington) with a fleet and an
army to Portugal. He landed his men at the mouth of the Mondego River on
July 1, 1808, and was soon joined by bands of Portuguese infantry.
Junot, who had allowed himself a life of pleasure and ease instead of
keeping his forces in condition, led his 13,000 conscripts out from
Lisbon to meet Wellesley’s 19,000 soldiers at Vimeiro (August 21, 1808),
and suffered a disabling defeat. Portugal returned to alliance with
England, and the French invasion of the Peninsula appeared to be a
complete disaster.</p>
<p>When Napoleon reached Paris on August 14, 1808, after his triumphal
tour of his western provinces, he found his traditional enemies
rejoicing over French setbacks, and already preparing another coalition
against the now vincible consumer of nations. Metternich, Austrian
ambassador to France, talked peace to Napoleon and planned war. Freiherr
vom und zum Stein, bril- liant chief minister in a Prussia eager for
liberation, wrote to a friend in this August: “Here war between France
and Austria is r egarded as inevitable; it will decide the fate of
Europe.” 21 Napoleon, whose agents intercepted that letter, agreed. War,
he wrote to brother Louis, “is postponed until spring.” 22</p>
<p>Napoleon pondered his choice. Should he lead his never defeated
Grande Armee to Spain, suppress the revolt, chase Wellesley back to his
ships, close the Portuguese gap in the blockade, and run the risk that
Austria and Prussia would strike while his best troops were a thousand
miles away? Alexander, at Tilsit, had promised to prevent such an attack
upon him while Spain held him; but would the Czar keep his word under
stress? Perhaps he should be additionally bribed. Napoleon invited him
to a conference at Erfurt, where he would overwhelm him with a galaxy of
political stars, and pin him to his pledge.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>CONSTELLATION AT ERFURT: SEPTEMBER 27 -OCTOBER 1 4, 1808</li>
</ol>
<p>He prepared for that conference with as much care as for a war. He
in- vited all his vassal kings and dukes to attend in regal style and
with their retinues. So many of them came that Talleyrand’s printed
memoirs took three pages to list them. 23 Napoleon took with him not
only his family but most of his generals, and he asked Talleyrand to
come out of his retirement and help Champagny to formalize the
negotiations and results. He instructed the Comte de Remusat to
transport to Erfurt the best actors of the Comedie- Frangaise —
including Talma — with all the apparatus needed to produce the classic
tragedies of the French drama. “I wish the Emperor of Russia,” he said,
“to be dazzled by the sight of my power. For there is no negotiation
which it could fail to render easier.” 24</p>
<p>He reached Erfurt on September 27, and on the 28th he rode out
five</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xmiles to greet Alexander and his Russian entourage. Every
arrangement was made to please the Czar, except that Napoleon left no
doubt that he was host, and in a German city that had become part of the
French Empire. Alex- ander was not deceived by the gifts and flatteries
that came to him, and he too put on all the signs and forms of
friendship. His resistance to Napoleon’s charms was furthered by
Talleyrand, who secretly advised him to support Austria rather than
France, arguing that Austria, not France, was the pivot of that European
civilization which (in Talleyrand’s view) Napoleon was destroying.
“France,” he said, “is civilized, but her sovereign is not.” 25 More -
over, how could it be to Russia’s advantage to strengthen France? W hen
Napoleon sought to reinforce the alliance by marrying Alexander’s sister
the Grand Duchess Anna, Talleyrand counseled the Czar against agreement,
and the wily Russian delayed replying to the proposal on the ground that
the Czarina had charge of such affairs. 26 He rewarded Talleyrand by
arranging the marriage of the diplomat’s nephew to the Duchess of Dino,
heiress to the duchy of Courland. Talleyrand later defended his
treachery on the ground that Napoleon’s appetite for nations was bound
not on ly to exhaust Europe with war, but to lead to the collapse and
dismemberment of France; his treachery to Napoleon, he claimed, was
fidelity to France. 27 But henceforth his good manners left a bad odor
everywhere.</p>
<p>During the conference the Duke of Saxe-Weimar invited his most famous
subject to come to Erfurt. On September 29 Napoleon, seeing Goethe’s
name on a list of new arrivals, asked the Duke to arrange a meeting with
the poet-philosopher. Goethe gladly came (October 2), for he judged
Napoleon as “the greatest mind the world has ever seen,” 28 and he quite
approved of uniting Europe under such a head. He found the Emperor at
breakfast with Talleyrand, Berthier, Savary, and General Daru.
Talleyrand included in his Memoirs what he claimed to be a careful
recollection of this famous collo- quy. (Felix Muller, a Weimar
magistrate who accompanied Goethe, gave a report only slightly
different.)</p>
<p>“Monsieur Goethe,” said Napoleon, “I am delighted to see you…. I know
that you are Germany’s leading dramatic poet.”</p>
<p>“Sire, you wrong our country…. Schiller, Lessing, and Wieland are
surely known to Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“I confess I hardly know them. However, I have read Schiller’s Thirty
Years’ War…. You generally live in Weimar; it is the p lace where the
most celebrated men of German literature meet!”</p>
<p>“Sire, they enjoy greater protection there; but for the present there
is only one man in Weimar who is known throughout Europe; it is
Wieland.” “I should be delighted to see Monsieur Wieland.”</p>
<p>“If Your Majesty will allow me to ask him, I feel certain that he
will come immediately.”…</p>
<p>“Are you an admirer of Tacitus?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sire, I admire him much.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t; but we shall talk of that another time. Write to tell
Monsieur Wieland to come here. I shall return his visit at Weimar, where
the Duke has invited me.” 29</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>As Goethe left the room (we are told) Napoleon remarked to Berthier
and Daru, u VoiU un homme /” 30</p>
<p>A few days later Napoleon, amid a host of notables, entertained
Goethe and Wieland. Perhaps he had refreshed his recollections, for he
spoke like a literary critic confident of his knowledge:</p>
<p>“Monsieur Wieland, we like your works very much in France. It is you
who are the author of Agathon and Oberon. We call you the Voltaire of
Ger- many.”</p>
<p>“Sire, the comparison would be a flattering one if it were
justified….”</p>
<p>“Tell me, Monsieur Wieland, why your Diogenes , your Agathon , and
your Peregrinus are written in the equivocal style which mixes romance
with his- tory, and history with romance. A superior man like yourself
ought to keep each style distinctly separate…. But I am afraid to say
too much on this sub- ject, because I am dealing with someone much more
conversant with the matter than I am.” 31</p>
<p>On October 5, Napoleon rode out some fifteen miles to Weimar. After a
hunt at Jena, and a performance of La Mort de Cesar in the Weimar
theater, the hosts and guests attended a ball where the splendor of the
surroundings and the glamour of the women made them soon forget the
verses of Voltaire. Napoleon, however, withdrew to a corner, and asked
for Goethe and Wie- land. They brought other literati with them.
Napoleon spoke, especially to Wieland, on two of his favorite subjects —
history and Tacitus:</p>
<p>“A good tragic drama should be looked upon as the most worthy school
for superior men. From a certain point of view it is above history. In
the best his- tory very little effect is produced. Man when alone is but
little affected; men assembled receive the stronger and more lasting
impressions.</p>
<p>“I assure you that the historian Tacitus, whom you are always
quoting, never taught me anything. Could you find a greater, and at
times more unjust, detractor of the human race? In the most simple
actions he finds criminal mo- tives; he makes emperors out as the most
profound villains…. His Annals are not a history of the Empire but an
abstract of the prison records of Rome. They are always dealing with
accusations, convicts, and people who open their veins in their baths….
What an involved style! How obscure!… Am I not right, Monsieur Wieland?
But… we are not here to speak of Tacitus. Look how well Czar Alexan der
dances.” 32</p>
<p>Wieland was not overwhelmed; he defended Tacitus with both courage
and courtesy. He pointed out, “Suetonius and Dio Cassius relate a much
greater number of crimes than Tacitus, in a style void of energy, while
nothing is more terrible than Tacitus’ pen.” And, with a bold hint to Na
- poleon: “By the stamp of his genius one would believe he could love
only the Republic…. But when he speaks of the emperors who so happily
recon- ciled… the Empire and liberty, one feels that the art of
governing appears to him the most beautiful discovery on earth…. Sire,
if it be true to say of Tacitus that tyrants are punished when he paints
them, it is still more true to say that good princes are rewarded when
he traces their images and pre- sents them to future glory.”</p>
<p>The assembled listeners were delighted by this vigorous riposte, and
Napo-</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xleon was a bit confused. “I have too strong a party to contend with,
Mon - sieur Wieland, and you neglect none of your advantages…. I do not
like to say that I am beaten;… to that I would consent with difficulty.
Tomor- row I return to Erfurt, and we shall continue our discussions.”
33 We have no report of that further encounter.</p>
<p>By October 7 most of the visitors were back in Erfurt. Napoleon urged
Goethe to come and live in Paris; “there you will find a larger circle
for</p>
<p>Meanwhile the foreign ministers of the two Powers had drawn up an
agreement renewing their alliances, and pledging mutual aid in case
either of them should be attacked. Alexander was to be left free to take
Wallachia and Moldavia, but not Turkey; Napoleon could proceed to Spain
with the Czar’s blessing. On October 1 2 the document was signed. Two
days later the Emperors left Erfurt; for a while they rode side by side;
before they parted they embraced, and promised to meet again. (They did
not.) Napoleon re- turned to Paris less sanguine than when he had come,
but resolved to take his Grande Armee to Spain and reseat brother Joseph
on his unwelcome throne.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE PENINSULAR WAR: II (OCTOBER 29, 1808- JANUARY 1 6 , 1809)</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a typical Napoleonic campaign: swift, victorious, and futile.
The Emperor sensed the rising opposition of the French people to the
endless concatenation of his wars. They had agreed with him that his
wars on the eastern front had been caused by governments conspiring to
annul the Revo- lution; but they felt that their blood was being
drained, and they resented especially its expenditure in Portugal and
Spain. He understood that feeling, and feared that he was losing his
hold on the nation, but (as he argued in retrospect) “it was impossible
to leave the Peninsula a prey to the machina - tions of the English, the
intrigues, hopes, and pret ensions of the Bourbons.” 35 Unless Spain
should be securely tied to France it would be at the mercy of British
armies coming through Portugal or Cadiz; soon England would gather the
gold and silver of Portuguese or Spanish America, and pour it out in
subsidies to finance a new coalition against France; there would have to
be more Marengos, Austerlitzes, Jenas… Only a border-tight blockade of
British goods could bring those London merchants to talk peace.</p>
<p>Leaving some fortresses garrisoned against Austrian or Prussian
surprises, Napoleon ordered 150,000 men of the Grand Army to march over
the Pyrenees and join the 65,000 men that Joseph had meanwhile assembled
at Vitoria. He himself left Paris on October 29 with his plan of
campaign al- read y formed. The Spanish army was attempting to surround
Joseph’s troops; Napoleon sent instructions to his brother to avoid
battle, and let the enemy advance in a spreading and thinning
semicircle. When he neared</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>Vitoria, the Emperor deployed part of his forces to attack the
Spanish cen- ter; it broke and fled. Another French division captured
Burgos (Novem- ber 10); others, under Ney and Lannes, at Tudela,
overwhelmed a Spanish army under Jose de Palafox y Melzi. Perceiving
that their soldiers and gen- erals could not cope with the Grand Army
and Napoleon, the Spaniards scattered again into the provinces, and on
December 4 the Emperor entered Madrid. When some of his troops began to
pillage, he had two of them pub- licly executed; the pillaging stopped.
36</p>
<p>Leaving the city under a strong garrison and martial law, Napoleon
took up his quarters three miles away at Chamartin. Thence, like some
god cre- ating a world, he issued (December 4) a series of decrees,
including a new constitution for Spain. Some of its clauses show him
still a “Son of the Revo - lution”:</p>
<p>To date from the publication of this decree, feudal rights are
abolished in Spain. All personal obligations, all exclusive rights,… all
feudal monopolies… are suppressed. Everyone who shall conform to the
laws shall be free to develop his industry without restraint.</p>
<p>The tribunal of the Inquisition is abolished, as inconsistent with
the civil sovereignty and authority. Its property shall be sequestered
and fall to the Spanish state, to serve as security for the bonded
debt….</p>
<p>Considering that the members of various monastic orders have
increased to an undue degree,… religious houses in Spain… shall be
reduced to a third of their present number… by uniting the members of
several houses of the same order into one….</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the institution which stands most in the way
of the internal prosperity of Spain is that of the customs lines
separating the prov- inces,… the barrier existing between the provinces
shall be suppressed. 37</p>
<p>Only martial mastery could enforce such a constitution over the
active opposition of the entrenched nobility, the monastic clergy, and a
population inured by time to feudal leadership and a consolatory creed.
And that mas- tery was precarious. Wellesley was still triumphant in
Portugal, and might invade Spain as soon as the Grand Army should be
called back to face a challenging Austria. Moreover, a British army of
twenty thousand men under Sir John Moore left Salamanca on December 1 3
and began a march northeastward, aiming to overwhelm Soult’s division
near Burgos. Respond - ing quickly to this challenge, Napoleon led a
substantial French force north over the Sierra de Guadarrama in the hope
of attacking the rear of Moore’s columns; now at last he would match his
wits and soldiers against those hitherto sea-protected Englishmen. The
passage through the Guadarrama Pass in midwinter was a much severer
ordeal for his men than the crossing of the Alps in 1800; they suffered
and grumbled, almost to mutiny, but Napo- leon would not abandon the
chase. Moore learned of his coming, and — fear- ing to be caught between
two French armies — turned his troops westward on a hurried march over
250 miles of rugged snow-covered terrain toward Corunna, where they
could find refuge in a British fleet.</p>
<p>At Astorga, January 2, 1809, Napoleon was close on their heels. But
here he was stopped by disturbing news from two sources: in Austria the
Arch-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xduke Karl Ludwig was making active preparations for war; in Paris
Talley- rand and Fouche were aiding a plan to replace Napoleon with
Murat. The Emperor left the pursuit of Moore to Soult, and hurried back
to France. Soult, the master gone, eased his pace, and did not reach
Corunna until most of the British had gained their ships. Moore led an
heroic rearguard action to protect the last stages of the embarkation;
he was mortally wounded, but did not die until the embarkation was
complete. “If only I had had time to follow the English,” Napoleon
mourned, “not a single man jack of them would have escaped.” 38 They not
only escaped; they came back.</p>
<p>V. FOUCHE, TALLEYRAND, AND AUSTRIA: 1809</p>
<p>When he reached Paris (January 23) Napoleon found conspiracies brew-
ing amid public discontent. Letters from soldiers at the front revealed
to hun- dreds of French families that Spanish resistance was re-forming
and resolute, and that Wellesley, his forces augmented, would soon move
to oust Joseph again from Madrid. Evidently war would go on, and French
boys would be conscripted year after year to force upon the Spaniards a
government hostile to their powerful Church and alien to their pride and
blood. The royalists of France, despite Napoleon’s moves to appease
them, had resumed their plots to depose him; six such conspirators had
been caught and shot in 1808; another, Armand de Chateaubriand, was
executed in February, 1809, despite the appeals of his brother Rene,
then the most acclaimed author in France. Several Jacobins schemed for
opposite reasons for the same end. Even in the imperial government
dissatisfaction with Napoleon was mounting: Fontanes voiced it
discreetly, Deeres openly: “The Emperor is mad, completely mad; he will
bring ruin upon himself and upon us all.” 39</p>
<p>Fouche, minister of police, had won compliments from Napoleon for ex-
posing assassination plots, but he was increasingly doubtful of his
master’s policies, and of his own future in the inevitable collapse.
Sooner or later, he felt, the beaten but proud governments of Austria
and Prussia, and the super- ficially pro-French government of Russia,
would unite again, fused with British gold, to man another push against
an uncomfortably dominant France. Moreover, Napoleon in some coming
battle might lose his life; why should not some shot find and end him,
as a shot, not long ago, had ended a general standing at his side? Would
not his sudden death, heirless, throw France into a chaos that would
leave it defenseless against its foes? Perhaps Talleyrand could be
persuaded to join in grooming Murat for a throne left vacant by
Napoleon’s capture or death. On December 20, 1808, Fouche and Talleyrand
agreed that Murat was their man; and Murat concurred. Eugene de
Beauharnais got wind of the plan and told it to Madame Mere, who re-
layed it to her son in Spain. 40</p>

<p>ommended the exec ution of the Due d’Enghien and the appropriation of
Spain, and probably shared responsibility for the increasing coolness of
Alex- ander. On January 24, 1809, seeing Talleyrand in the Council of
State, Na- poleon released his long-concealed resentment in a violent
public reproof: “You have dared to maintain, sir, that you knew nothing
about Enghien’s death; you have dared to maintain that you knew nothing
whatever about the Spanish war!… Have you forgotten that you advised me
in writing to have Enghien executed? Have you forgotten that in your
letters you ad- vised me to revive the policy of Louis XIV [i.e., to
establish his own family on the throne of Spain]?” Then, shaking his
fist in Talleyrand’s face, Napo - leon cried, “Understand thi s: if a
revolution should break out, no matter what part you had played in it,
you would be the first to be crushed!… You are ordure in a silk
stocking.” That said, the Emperor hurriedly left the room. Talleyrand,
limping after him, remarked to the councilors, “What a pity that so
great a man should have such bad manners!” 41 On the morrow Napoleon
ended Talleyrand’s functions and salary as grand chamberlain. Soon, as
was his wont, he regretted his outburst, and made no objection to
Talleyrand’s continued presence at court. In 1812 he could still say,
“He is the most capable minister I ever had.” 42 Talleyrand lost no
chance to hasten Napoleon’s fall.</p>
<p>Austria was doing her share. The whole country, from rich to
poor,</p>
<p>seemed eager for an attempt to free itself from the hard peace that
Napo- leon had laid upon it. Only Emperor Francis I hesitated,
protesting that the appropriations for the army were bankrupting the
state. Talleyrand sent encouraging words: the Grand Army was mired in
Spain, French public opinion was strongly opposed to war, Napoleon’s
position was precarious. 43 Metternich, hitherto hesitant, argued that
the time had come for Austria to strike. Napoleon warned the Austrian
government that if it continued to arm he would have no choice but to
raise another army at whatever cost. The Austrians continued to arm.
Napoleon called upon Alexander to warn them; the Czar sent them a word
of caution, which could be interpreted as counseling delay. Napoleon
summoned two divisions from Spain, called up 100,000 conscripts, and
ordered and received 100,000 troops from the Rhine Confederation, which
feared for its life if Austria should overcome France; by April, 1809,
Napoleon had 310,000 men under his command. A separate force of 72,000
French and 20,000 Italians was organized to protect Viceroy Eugene from
an Austrian army sent to Italy under the Archduke Johann. On April 9 the
Archduke Karl Ludwig invaded Bavaria with 200,000 men. On April 1 2
England signed a new alliance with Austria, pledging fresh sub- sidies.
On April 1 3 Napoleon left Paris for Strasbourg, after announcing to his
worried palace staff, “In two months I shall compel Austria to disarm.”
On April 17 he reached his main army at Donauworth on the Danube, and
gave final orders for the deployment of his forces.</p>
<p>The French won some minor engagements at Abensberg and Landshut
(April 19 and 20). At Eckmiihl (April 22) Marshal Davout led an

<p>Xble attack upon Archduke Karl Ludwig’s left wing while Napoleon’s
own divisions assaulted the center; after losing 30,000 men Karl
retreated into Bohemia. Napoleon marched on to Vienna, which he entered
on May 12 after a difficult and bravely contested crossing to the right
bank of the Dan- ube, there three thousand feet wide. In the meantime
Karl reorganized his forces and brought them back to the left bank of
the river at Essling. Napo- leon tried to recross it, hoping to defeat
the Archduke in a decisive engage- ment. But the Danube was in a rising
flood, which swept away the principal bridges; part of the French army
and much of the ammunition had to be left behind; and on May 22
Napoleon’s 60,000 men foun d themselves embattled with 115,000 Austrian
troops. After losing 20,000 men — the beloved Lannes among them — the
Emperor ordered the remaining 40,000 to recross the Dan- ube by whatever
means they could find. The Austrians had lost 23,000, but the encounter
was accepted throughout Europe as a disastrous defeat for Napoleon.
Prussia and Russia watched the sequel eagerly, ready, at any fur- ther
encouragement, to pounce upon the troublesome upstart who had so long
eluded the lords of feudalism.</p>
<p>In Italy the fate of Viceroy Eugene had wavered in the balance of
events. His Milan base, despite his genial rule, had been made insecure
by the rising discontent of the people with Napoleon’s treatment of the
Pope. It was with considerable trepidation that Eugene led his army
eastward to meet the Archduke Johann. He was defeated at the Tagliamento
on April 16, and matters might have gone still worse for him had not
Johann, on hearing of Napoleon’s victory at Eckmiihl, turned back in the
vain hope of savin g Vi- enna. Eugene, risking the loss of Italy to
reinforce his adoptive father, also moved north, and reached him in time
to be with him at Wagram.</p>
<p>After the repulse at Essling, Napoleon, reinforced in troops and
artillery, had new bridges built across the Danube, and strongly
fortified, as camp and arsenal, the island of Lobay, situated in the
river only 360 feet from the left bank. On July 4 he bade his army cross
again. Seeing himself outnumbered, Karl Ludwig retreated north; Napoleon
pursued him, and at Wagram 187,000 Frenchmen and allies met 136,000
Austrians and allies in one of the bloodiest battles in history. The
Austrians fought well, and were at times near victory; but Napoleon’s
superior ity in manpower and tactics turned the tide, and after two days
(July 5-6, 1809) of competitive homicide Karl, having lost 50,000 men,
ordered a retreat. Napoleon had lost 34,000, but he had 153,000 left,
while Karl had only 86,000; the odds were now two to one. The despondent
Archduke asked for a truce, which Napoleon was glad to give.</p>
<p>He settled down in Schonbrunn with Mme. Walewska, and rejoiced to
learn that she was pregnant; who now could say that it was his fault
that Josephine had not borne him a child? Marie’s aged husband was
gallant enough to forgive her distinguished infidelity; he invited her
back to his estate in Poland, and prepared to acknowledge the child as
his own. 44</p>
<p>Peace negotiations dallied for three months, partly because Karl
Ludwig could not persuade his brother Francis I that further resistance
could not be</p>

<p>organized, and partly because Emperor Francis hoped that Prussia and
Rus- sia would come to his aid. Napoleon helped Alexander to resist the
appeal by offering him part of Galicia, and promising not to restore the
kingdom of Poland; on September 1 the Czar informed Austria that he was
not pre- pared to break with France. The Austrian negotiators still held
out, until Napoleon laid down an ultimatum. On October 14 they signed
the Treaty of Schonbrunn, dictated by France in the royal palace of her
ancient Haps- burg foes. Austria ceded the Innviertel and Salzburg to
the Bavaria that she had so often invaded. Part of Galicia went to
Russia, part of it to the grand duchy of Warsaw in partial return of
territory taken by Austria in the partitions of Poland. Fiume, Istria,
Trieste, Venezia, part of Croatia, most of Carinthia and Carniola were
taken by France. Altogether Austria lost 3,500,000 taxable souls, and
had to pay an indemnity of 85 million francs. Napoleon took all this as
his due, and six months later he capped his spoils by getting an
Austrian archduchess as his bride.</p>

</ol>
<p>He left Vienna on October 15, 1809, and reached Fontainebleau on the
26th. He explained to intimate relatives and councilors his decision to
seek a divorce. They were almost unanimous in approving, but not till
Novem- ber 30 did he summon up the courage to reveal his intention to
Josephine. Despite his extramarital diversions, which seemed to him the
legitimate privilege of a traveling warrior, he still loved her, and the
break was to cause mm months of emotional misery.</p>
<p>He knew her faults — her lazy, languid ways, her leisurely toilette,
her extravagance in dress and jewelry, her inability to say no to
milliners com- ing to display their wares. “She purchased all that was
brought to her, at no matter what price.” 45 Her debts repeatedly
reached levels that brought storms from her husband; he drove the
saleswomen from her rooms, scolded her, and paid the debts. He allowed
her 600,000 francs per year for her personal expenses, and 1 20,000 more
for her charities, for he knew that she was a compulsive giver. 46 He
indulged her love for diamonds, perhaps be- cause they made her
fascinating despite her forty-two years. She was all feel- ing and no
intellect, except the wisdom that nature gives to women for handling
men. “Josephine,” he told her, “you have an excellent heart and a weak
head.” 47 He seldom let her talk politics, and when she persisted he
soon forgot her views. But he was grateful for the sensuous warmth of
her embr aces, for the “unfailing sweetness of her disposition,” 48 and
for the modesty and grace with which she fulfilled her many functions as
an em- press. She loved him beyond idolatry, and he loved her this side
of power. When Mme. de Stael accused him of not liking women, he
replied, simply, “I like my wife.” 49 Antoine Arnault marveled at “the
empire exercised by the gentlest and most indolent of Creoles over the
most willful and despotic of men. His determination, before which all
men quailed, could not resist</p>
<p>2 34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xhe tears of a woman.” 50 As Napoleon put it at St. Helena, “I
generally had to give in.” 51</p>
<p>She had long known his yearning for an heir of his blood as the
legitimate and accepted inheritor of his rule; she knew his fear that
without such a traditional transmission of power his capture, death, or
serious illness would lead to a mad scramble of factions and generals
for supremacy, and that in the resultant chaos the orderly, prosperous,
and powerful France which he was building could disintegrate into
another such terror — red or white — as that from which he had rescued
it in 1 799.</p>
<p>When, finally, he told her that they must part, she fainted,
sincerely enough to be unconscious for many minutes. Napoleon carried
her to her rooms, summoned his doctor, Jean-Nicolas Corvisart des
Marets, and asked for Hortense’s help in appeasing her mother. For a
week Josephine refused consent; then, on December 7, Eugene arrived from
Italy, and persuaded her. Napoleon comforted her with every tenderness.
“I shall always love you,” he told her, “but politics has no heart; it
has only a head.” 52 She was to have full title to the chateau and
grounds of Malmaison, the title of empress, and a substantial annuity.
He assured her children that he would be, to the end, their loving
father.</p>
<p>On December 16 the Senate, after hearing the requests of both the Em-
peror and the Empress for the dissolution of their marriage, issued a
decree of divorce, and on January 12 the Metropolitan Archbishop of
Paris pro- nounced their marriage annulled. Many Catholics questioned
the canonical validity of the annulment; in most of France the
population disapproved of the separation; and many prophesied that from
this time the good fortune that had so regularly followed Napoleon would
seek other favorites. 53</p>
<p>Politics having prevailed over love, Napoleon proceeded to seek a
mate who not only would give promise of motherhood, but would bring with
her some imperial connections helpful to the security of France and his
rule. On November 22 (eight days before asking Josephine for a divorce)
Napo- leon instructed Caulaincourt, his ambassador in St. Petersburg, to
present an official request to Alexander for the hand of his
sixteen-year-old sister, Anna Pavlova. The Czar knew that his mother,
who called Napoleon “that athe - ist,” would never approve such a union,
but he del ayed replying, hoping to secure from Napoleon, as a quid pro
quo, some territorial concessions in Poland. Impatient with the
negotiations, and fearing a refusal, Napoleon acted on Metternich’s hint
that Austria would receive favorably a proposal for the Archduchess
Marie Louise. Cambaceres opposed the plan, predicting that it would end
the Russian alliance and lead to war. 54</p>
<p>Marie Louise, then eighteen years old, was not beautiful, but her
blue eyes, pink cheeks, and chestnut hair, her mild temper and simple
tastes, were well adjusted to Napoleon’s needs; all the evidence vouched
for her present virginity and future fertility. She had considerable
education, knew several languages, was skilled in music, drawing, and
painting. From her childhood she had been taught to hate her suitor as
the most wicked man in</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE MORTAL REALM</p>
<p>2 35</p>
<p>Europe, but also she had learned that a princess was a political
commodity, whose tastes in men must be subordinated to the good of the
state. After all, this famous infamous monster must be an exciting
change from the dull routine of a guarded girl longing for a wider
world.</p>
<p>So, on March 1 1, 1810, at Vienna, she was formally married to the
absent Napoleon, who was represented by Marshal Berthier. Repeating
Marie An- toinette’s bridal procession of 1770, she moved with eighty
-three coaches and carriages through fifteen days and ceremonial nights
to reach Compiegne on March 27. Napoleon had arranged to meet her there,
but — curious or courteous — he drove out to welcome her at nearby
Courcelles. On seeing her — but let him tell the story:</p>
<p>I got out of the carriage quickly and kissed Marie Louise. The poor
child had learned by heart a long speech, which she was to repeat to me
kneeling…. I had asked Metternich and the Bishop of Nantes whether I
could spend the night under the same roof with Marie Louise. They
removed all my doubts, and assured me that she was now Empress and not
Archduchess…. I was only separated from her bedroom by the library. I
asked her what they had told her when she left Vienna. She answered me
very naively that her father and Frau Lazansky had directed her as
follows: “As soon as you are alone with the Emperor you must do
absolutely everything that he tells you. You must agree to everything
that he asks of you.” She was a delightful child.</p>
<p>Monsieur Segur wanted me to keep away from her for form’s sake, but
as I was already surely married, everything was all right, and I told
him to go to the devil. 66</p>
<p>The pair were united by a civil marriage at St.-Cloud on April 1,
and, on the next day, by a religious marriage in the great hall of the
Louvre. Nearly all the cardinals refused to attend this service, on the
ground that the Pope had not annulled the marriage to Josephine;
Napoleon exiled them to the provinces. Otherwise he was exuberantly
happy. He found his bride sen- sually and socially pleasing — modest,
obedient, generous and kind; she never learned to love him, but she was
a cheerful companion. As empress she never achieved the popularity of
Josephine, but she was accepted as symbolizing the triumph of France
over the hostile royalties of Europe.</p>
<p>Napoleon did not forget Josephine. He visited her so often at
Malmaison that Marie began to pout, whereupon he desisted; but then he
sent Josephine comforting letters, nearly all addressed to “My love.” 56
To one of these she replied from Navarre in Normandy on April 21,
1810:</p>
<p>A thousand, thousand thanks for not having forgotten me. My son has
just brought me your letter. With what ardor have I read it!… There is
not a word in it which has not made me weep; but those tears were very
sweet….</p>
<p>I wrote to you on leaving Malmaison, and how many times thereafter
did I wish to write! But I felt the reasons for your silence, and I
feared to be im- portunate….</p>
<p>Be happy, be happy as you deserve; it is my whole heart that speaks.
You have given me too my share of happiness, and a share very keenly
felt…. Adieu, my friend. I thank you as tenderly as I shall love you
always. 67</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XShe consoled herself with finery and hospitality. He allowed her
three mil- lion francs a year; she spent four million; after her death
in 1814 some bills for her unpaid purchases pursued him to Elba. 58 At
Malmaison she collected a gallery of art, and entertained without
counting costs. Invitations to her receptions were valued next to N
apoleon’s. Mme. Tallien— now the fat and forty Princesse de Chimay —
came, and together they recalled the days when they were queens of the
Directory. Countess Walewska came; she was well received, and joined
with Josephine in mourning their lost lover.</p>
<p>He was granted two years of happiness and relative peace. The Treaty
of Schonbrunn had enlarged his realm, enriched his Treasury, and
stimulated his appetite. He had annexed the Papal States (May 17, 1809),
and had re- stored Joseph to his royal seat in Madrid. In January, 1810,
Sweden, long an enemy, signed peace with France, and joined the
Continental Blockade; in June, with Napoleon’s solicited consent, she
accepted Bernadotte as heir apparent to the Swedish throne. In December
Napoleon absorbed Hamburg, Bremen, Liibeck, Berg, and Oldenburg into the
French Empire. His anxiety to close all Continental ports to British
trade made him, in the eyes of his foes, an insatiable conqueror
accumulating debts to the jealous gods. Domestically, matters were quiet
and comforting; France was prosperous and proud; the only ripple on the
stream was the final dismissal of Fouche for exceeding his powers.
Savary succeeded him as minister of police, while Fouche retired to
Aix-en-Provence to plan revenge. External affairs were not so smooth.
Holland was cursing the embargo on British goods; Italy, proud of the
Papacy, was losing patience with Napoleon; Wellington was building an
army in Portugal for an invasion of Spain; and beyond the Rhine the
German states under Bonapartist rule were complaining of im- positions,
and were only waiting for some imperial blunder to let them re- turn to
more congenial masters.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Marie Louise was with child, and the happy Emperor</p>
<p>counted the days to her fulfillment. When the great event approached,
he surrounded it with all the ceremony and solemnity that had
traditionally greeted a Bourbon birth. Announcement was made that if the
child was a daughter Paris would hear a salvo of twenty-one guns; if it
was a son the salvos would continue to 10 1. The delivery was extremely
painful; the fetus proposed to come into the world feet first.
Dr. Corvisart told Napoleon that either the mother or the child might
have to be sacrificed; he was told to save the mother at any cost. 59
Another physician used instruments to invert the fetus; Marie for some
minutes was near death. Finally the child agreed to emerge head first;
both mother and child survived (March 20, 181 1). The 10 1 cannon shots
sent their message over Paris, echoing through France; and there were
not many persons in Europe who could begrudge the Em- peror his
happiness. All the rulers of Continental Europe sent their congratu-
lation s to the fond father and to the already proclaimed “King of
Rome.” 80 Now, for the first time in his career, Napoleon could feel
tolerably secure; he had founded a dynasty that, in his hopes, would be
as splendid and beneficent as any in history, and might even make Europe
one.</p>
