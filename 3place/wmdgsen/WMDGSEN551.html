<h4 id="chapter-xxxiii-samuel-johnson">CHAPTER XXXIII Samuel
Johnson</h4>
<p>1709-84</p>
<p>I. DEFORMATIVE YEARS: 1709-46</p>
<p>H E was unique and yet typical; unlike any Englishman of his time,
yet summarizing John Bull in body and soul; surpassed in every
literary</p>
<p>field (except lexicography) by his contemporaries, yet dominating
them for a generation, reigning over them without raising anything but
his voice.</p>
<p>Let us record briefly the blows that beat him into his peculiar form.
He was the first child born to Michael Johnson, bookseller, printer, and
sta- tioner in Lichfield, 118 miles from London. The mother, nee Sarah
Ford, was of slightly genteel stock. She was thirty-seven when, in 1706,
she mar- ried Michael, who was fifty.</p>
<p>Samuel was a sickly child, so weak at birth that he was baptized at
once, lest, dying unchristened, he should, by the laws of theology, be
lodged forever in Limbo, the gloomy vestibule of hell. He soon showed
signs of scrofula. When he was thirty months old his mother, though
pregnant with her second son, took him on the long ride to London to be
“touched for the king’s evil” by Queen Anne. The Q ueen did her best,
but the disease cost Johnson the use of one eye and one ear, and shared
with other tribulations in disfiguring his face. 1 Nevertheless he grew
strong in muscle and frame; and his strength as well as his bulk
supported that absolutism which, as Gold- smith complained, turned the
republic of letters into a monarchy. Samuel thought that he had
inherited from his father the “vile melancholy which has made me mad all
my life, at least not sober.” 2 Perhaps, as in Cowper’s case, his hyp
ochondria had a religious as well as a physical basis; Johnson’s mother
was a firm Calvinist, who thought that eternal damnation was just around
the corner. Samuel suffered from fear of hell to the day of his
death.</p>
<p>From his father he derived his Tory politics, Jacobite leanings, and
a pas- sion for books. He read eagerly in his father’s store; later he
told Boswell, “I knew almost as much at eighteen as I do now.” 3 After
some elementary in - struction he passed on to Lichfield grammar school,
where the headmaster was “so brutal that no man who had been educated by
him sent his son to the same school”; 4 however, when asked in after
years how he had acquired so good a command of Latin, he answered: “My
master whipt me very well. Without that, Sir, I should have done
nothing.” 5 In old age he deplored the obsolescence of the rod. “There
is now less flogging in our great schools than formerly, but then less
is learned there, so that what the boys get at one end they lose at the
other.” 6</p>
<p>818</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIII ) SAMUEL JOHNSON 819</p>
<p>In 1728 his parents found means to send him to Oxford. There he de-
voured the Greek and Latin classics, and harassed his teachers by
insubor- dination. In December, 1729, he hurried back to Lichfield,
perhaps because parental funds ran out, or because his hypochondria had
come so close to madness that he needed medical treatment. He received
this at. Birmingham; then, instead of returning to Oxford, he helped in
his father’s shop. When the father died (December, 1731) Samuel went to
work as assistant teacher in a school at Market Bosworth. Soon tiring of
this, he moved to Birming- ham, lived with a bookseller, and made five
guineas by translating a book about Abyssinia; this was a distant source
of Rasselas. In 1734 he returned to Lichfield, where his mother and
brother were carrying on the store. On July 9, 1735, two months short of
twenty-six, he married Elizabeth Porter, a widow of forty-eight with
three children and £ 700. With her money he opened a boarding school at
nearby Edial. David Garrick, a Lichfield boy, was one of his pupils, but
there were not enough to reconcile him to ped- agogy. Authorship was
fermenting in him. He wrote a drama, Irene, and sent word to Edward
Cave, editor of The Gentleman’s Magazine, explain- ing how that
periodical could be improved. On March 2, 1737, he rode off to London,
with David Garrick and one horse, to sell his tragedy and carve out a
place for himself in the cruel world.</p>
<p>His appearance was against him. He was thin and tall, but with a
large bony frame that made him a mass of angles. His face was blotched
with scrofula and was frequently agitated by a convulsive twitch; his
body was subject to alarming starts; his conversation was illustrated by
odd gesticula- tions. One bookseller to whom he applied for work advised
him to “get a porter’s knot and carry trunks.” 7 Apparently he received
some encourage - ment from Cave, for in July he went back to Lichfield,
and brought his wife to London.</p>
<p>He was not without subtlety. When Cave was attacked in the press
John- son wrote a poem in his defense and sent it to him; Cave published
it, gave him literary commissions, and joined Dodsley in issuing (May,
1738) John- son’s London, for which they gave him ten guineas. The poem
frankly imi - tated Juvenal’s Third Satire, and therefore emphasized the
lamentable as - pects of the city that the author soon learned to love;
it was also an attack upon the administration of Robert Walpole, whom
Johnson later described as “the best minister this country ever had.” 8
The poem was in part the angry</p>
<p>In those days of struggle Johnson turned his pen to every genre. He
wrote Lives of Eminent Persons (1740), and various articles for The
Gentleman’s Magazine, including imaginary reports of parliamentary
debates. Since re- porting of the debates was as yet forbidden, Cave hit
on the expedient of pretending that his magazine was merely recording
debates in the “Senate</p>
<p>820 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>formation as to the course of discussion in Parliament he composed
speeches which he ascribed to characters whose names were anagrams for
the main contenders in the House. 10 The debates bore such an air of
verisimilitude that many readers took them as verbatim reports, and
Johnson had to warn Smollett (who was writing a history of England) not
to rely on them as factual. Once, hearing praise of a speech ascribed to
Chatham, Johnson re- marked, “That speech I wrote in a garret in Exeter
Street.” 11 When someone commended the impartiality of his reports, he
confessed: “I saved appear - ances tolerably well, but I took care that
the Whig dogs should not have the best of it.” 12</p>
<p>How was he paid for his work? He once called Cave a “penurious pay -
master,” but he frequently professed affection for his memory. Between -
ated Johnson to slovenliness of dress and a “ravenous greediness” in
eating. 15</p>
<p>Richard Savage claimed, unconvincingly, to be the son of an earl, but
he had become a wastrel when Johnson met him in 1737. They roamed the
streets because they loved taverns more than their rooms. Boswell
mentions “with all possible respect and delicacy” that Johnson’s</p>
<p>conduct after he came to London, and had associated with Savage and
others, was not so strictly virtuous, in one respect, as when he was a
younger man. It was well known that his amorous inclinations were
uncommonly strong and impetuous. He owned to many of his friends that he
used to take women of the town to taverns, and hear them relate their
history. — In short, it must not be concealed that, like many other good
and pious men [did Boswell have Boswell in mind?],… Johnson was not free
from propensities which were ever “war - ring against the law of his
mind”— and that in his combats with them he was sometimes overcome.
16</p>
<p>Savage left London in July, 1739, and died in a debtor’s priso n in
1743. A year later Johnson issued The Life of Richard Savage, which
Henry Field- ing called “as just and well written a piece as, of its
kind, I ever saw.” 17 It presaged (and was later included in) the Lives
of the Poets. It was published anonymo usly, but literary London soon
discovered Johnson’s authorship. The booksellers began to think of him
as the man to compile a dictionary of the English language.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE DICTIONARY: 1 746-5 5</li>
</ol>
<p>Hume had written in 1741: “We have no dictionary of our l anguage,
and scarcely a tolerable grammar.” 18 He was mistaken, for Nathaniel
Bailey had</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>821</p>
<p>published An Universal Etymological English Dictionary in 1721, and
this had had predecessors semi-lexicographical. The proposal for a new
diction- ary was apparently made by Robert Dodsley in the presence of
Johnson, who said, “I believe I shall not undertake it.” 19 But when
other booksellers joined Dodsley in offering Johnson ^1,57 5 if he would
assume the obliga- tion, he signed the contract, June 18, 1746.</p>
<p>After much rumination he drew up a thirty-four-page Plan for a
Diction- ary of the English Language, and had it printed. He sent this
to several persons, among them Lord Chesterfield, then secretary of
state, with some hopeful praise of the Earl’s excellence in English and
other departments.</p>
<p>He went to his task leisurely, then more diligently, for his fee was
meted out to him in installments. When he reached the word lexicographer
he de- fined it as “a writer of dictionaries, a harmless drudge…” He had
hoped to finish in three years; he took nine. In 1 749 he moved to Gough
Square, off Fleet Street. He hired — and himself paid for — five or six
secretaries, and set them to work in a third-floor room. He read the
recognized English authors of the century from 1558 to 1660 — from the
accession of Elizabeth I to that of Charles II; he believed that the
English language had in that period reached its highest excellence, and
he proposed to take that Elizabethan- Ja- cobean speech as a standard by
which to establish good usage. He drew a line under each sentence that
he proposed to quote as illustrating the use of a word, and noted in the
margin the first letter of the word to be defined. His aides were
instructed to copy each marked sentence on a separate slip, and insert
this at its alphabetical place in Bailey’s dictionary, which served</p>
<p>During these nine years he took many holidays from definitions. Some-
times he found it easier to write a poem than to define a word. On
January 9, 1749, he issued a twelve-page poem, The Vanity of Human
Wishes. Like the London of a decade earlier, it was in form an imitation
of Juvenal, but it spoke with a power that was his own. He still
resented his poverty, and Chesterfield’s neglect:</p>
<p>There mark what ills the scholar’s life assail—</p>
<p>Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the gaol.</p>
<p>How vain are the warrior’s victories! See Charles XII of Swede n:</p>
<p>He left the name, at which the world grew pale.</p>
<p>To point a moral, or adorn a tale. 20</p>
<p>How foolish, then, to pray for long life when we see the vanity,
deceptions, and pains of old age: the mind wandering in repeated
anecdotes, fortune shaking with every day’s events, children scheming
for a legacy and mourn - ing death’s delay, while “unnumbered maladies
the joints invade, lay siege</p>
<p>822</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>o life, and press the dire blockade.” 21 From vai n hopes and sure
decay there is only one escape: prayer, and faith in a redeeming,
rewarding God.</p>
<p>Yet this pessimist had happy moments. On February 6, 1749, Garrick
staged Irene. It was a great event for Johnson; he washed himself, bound
his paunch in a scarlet waistcoat trimmed with gold lace, flourished a
hat likewise adorned, and watched his friend play Mohammed II to
Mrs. Cib- ber’s Irene. The tragedy ran for nine nights, and brought
Johnson £ 200; it was never revived, but Dodsley gave him another £ 1 00
for the copyright. He was now (1749) sufficiently famous and opulent to
found a club: not The Club, which came fifteen years later, but the “Ivy
Lane Club,” so</p>
<p>named from the street where, at the King’s Head Tavern, Johnson,
Hawkins, and seven others met on Tuesday evenings to eat beefsteak and
to barter prejudices. “Thither,” said Johnson, “I constantly resorted.”
22</p>
<p>Every Tuesday and Friday from March 21, 1750, to March 14, 1752, he
wrote a little essay published by Cave as The Rambler , for which he re-
ceived four guineas a week. The essays sold fewer than five hundred
copies, and Cave lost money on the venture, but when they were collected
into a book they achieved twelve editions before Johnson’s death. Shall
we confess that the only numbers that we found interesting are 1 70 and
1 7 1 , 2S in which Johnson made a prostitute point a moral and adorn
her tale? Critics com- plained that the style and vocabulary were too
sesquipedalianly Latinesque; but Boswell, between sins , found comfort
in Johnson’s exhortations to piety. 24</p>
<p>Johnson was under special strain in those years, for his mind was
fatigued by definitions, and his spirits were depressed by the
deterioration of his wife. “Tetty” calmed the pains of age and solit ude
with alcohol and opium. Often she kept Johnson from her bed. 25 He
rarely took her with him when he dined out. Dr. Taylor, who knew both of
them intimately, said she “was the plague of Johnson’s life, was
abominably drunken and despicable in every way, and Johnson frequently
complained… of his situation with such a wife.” 28 Her death (March 28,
1752) made him forget her faults, and he developed a post-mortem
uxoriousness that amused his friends. He extolled her virtues, lamented
his loneliness, and hoped she would intercede for him with Christ. 27
“He told me,” Boswell recalled, “that he generally went abroad at four
in the afternoon, and seldom came home till two in the morn- ing…. His
place of frequent resort was the Mitre Tavern in Fleet Street, where he
loved to sit up late.” 28</p>
<p>To be alone was terror. So Johnson, after his wife’s death, took into
his Gough Square home (1752) Anna Williams, a Welsh poetess who was
losing her sight. An operation to cure her failed, and she became
completely blind. Except for short intervals she stayed with Johnson
till her death (1783), superintending the household and the kitchen, and
carving the roast — and judging the fullness of cups with no other guide
than her fingers. To care for his more intimate needs Johnson (1753)
took a Negro servant, Frank Barber, who remained with him twenty-nine
years. Johnson sent him to school, labored to have him learn Latin and
Greek, and left him a substantial legacy. To complete the establishment
Johnson invited a derelict doctor,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>Robert Levett, to live with him (1760). The three formed a
quarrelsome menage, but Johnson was thankful for their company.</p>
<p>In January, 1755, he sent the final sheets of the Dictionary to the
printer, who thanked God that he was nearly finished with such a job and
such a man. News of the approaching publication reached Chesterfield,
who hoped for a dedication. He tried to atone for his former
invisibility by writing, for a magazine, two articles hailing the
expected work, and praising Johnson as one whom he would be glad to
accept as dictator of good English usage. The proud author sent the Earl
(February 7, 1755) a letter which Carlyle described as “that far -famed
Blast of Doom proclaiming that patronage should be no more”:</p>
<p>My Lord:</p>
<p>I have been lately informed, by the proprietor of The World, that two
papers, in which my Dictionary is recommended to the Publick, were
written by your Lordship. To be so distinguished is an honor, which,
being little accustomed to favors from the great, I know not well how to
receive, or in what terms to acknowledge….</p>
<p>Seven years, my Lord, have now passed since I waited in your outward
room, or was repulsed from your door; during which time I have been
pushing on my work through difficulties, of which it is useless to
complain, and have brought it, at last, to the verge of publication,
without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile
of favor. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a Patron
before….</p>
<p>Is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man
struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground,
encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take
of my labors, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed
till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and
cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I hope it is no
very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit has
been received, or to be unwilling that the Publick should consider me as
owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me to do for
myself.</p>
<p>Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any
favorer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though I should
conclude it, if less be possible, with less. For I have been long
wakened from that dream of hope in which I once boasted myself, with so
much exaltation,</p>
<p>My Lord,</p>
<p>Your Lordship’s most humble,</p>
<p>Most obedient servant,</p>
<p>Sam. Johnson 29</p>
<p>Chesterfield’s only comment on the letter was that it was “very well
writ - ten.” And indeed it is a masterpiece of eighteenth -century
prose, quite free from the Latin derivatives that had sometimes clogged
and burdened John- son’s style. Its author must have felt and pondered
it deeply, for he recited it to Boswell from memory twenty-six years
later. 30 It was not published till after Johnson’s death. Presumably
his resentment discolored his condemna - tion of Chesterfield’s Letters
to His Son — that “they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of
a dancing master.” 31</p>
<p>Johnson went up to Oxford early in 1755, partly to consult the
libraries,</p>
<p>824</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>but also to suggest to his friend Thomas Warton that it would help
float the Dictionary if its author could put a degree after his name.
Warton managed it, and in March Johnson was made an honorary Master of
Arts. So at last the Dictionary was published, in two large folio
volumes of almost 2,300 pages, priced at four pounds ten. In ending the
preface Johnson proclaimed that</p>
<p>he English Dictionary was written with little assistance of the
learned, and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft
obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academic bowers, but
amid inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow; and it
may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to observe, that if our
language is not here fully displayed, I have only failed in an attempt
which no human powers have hitherto completed…. I have pro- tracted my
work till most of those whom I wished to please have sunk into the
grave, and success and miscarriage are empty sounds; I therefore dismiss
it with frigid tranquillity, having little to fear or hope from censure
or praise.</p>
<p>The critics could not be expected to realize that Johnson’s
Dictionary marked a crest and watershed in the English literature of the
eighteenth century, as the Encyclopedic (1751- 72) of Diderot and
d’Alembert marked a crest and turning point in the literature of France.
Much fun was made of incidental defects in Johnson’s work. Among the
forty thousand entries there were oddities like gentilitious and
sygilate (which are respectfully preserved by Webster). There were angry
definitions like that of pension: “An allowance made to anyone without
an equivalent. In England it is gen - erally understood to mean pay
given to a state hireling for treason to his country.” Or excise: “a
hateful tax on commodities.” There were personal quirks, as in the
definition of oats: “a grain which in England is generally given to
horses, but in Scotland supports the people”— which was quite true.
Boswell asked Johnson “if civilization was a wo rd; he said No, but
civility was.” 32 Many of Johnson’s etymologies are now rejected; he had
much Latin and less Greek, but was poorly acquainted with modern
languages; he ad- mitted frankly that etymology was his weak point. 33
He defined pastern as “the knee of a horse” (it is part of a horse’s
foot) ; when a lady asked him how he came to make such a mistake he
answered, “Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance.” 34 In so large a work,
whose every page gave a dozen openings to error, he could not escape
missteps.</p>
<p>Johnson’s achievement was appreciated abroad. The French Academy sent
him a copy of its Dictionnaire , and the Accademia della Crusca of Flor-
ence sent him its Vocabolario. 33 The Dictionary sold well enough to
please the booksellers, who paid Johnson to prepare an abbreviated
edition. The larger form remained standard until Noah Webster replaced
it in 1828. It placed Johnson at the head of English authors in his
time; he actually ac- quired, except for aristocrats like Horace
Walpole, a dictatorship over Eng- lish letters. The reign of the “Great
Cham of Literature” began.*</p>

a letter to Wilkes, March 1 6, 1759.</li>

<p>However, he was not above being arrested for debt. He had spent his
pay- ment for the Dictionary as fast as it came. On March 16, 1756, he
wrote to Samuel Richardson: “Sir, I am obl iged to entreat your
assistance. I am now under arrest for five pounds eighteen shillings….
If you will be so good as to send me this sum, I will gratefully repay
you, and add it to all former obligations.” 36 Richardson sent six
guineas. He earned h is bread at this time by writing magazine articles,
by composing sermons at two guineas for less articulate clergymen, by
taking advance subscriptions to his promised edi- tion of Shakespeare,
and by contributing to The Universal Chronicle a weekly essay (April 15,
1758, to April 5, 1760) under the name of “The Idler.” These were in a
lighter vein than The Rambler, but still too grave</p>
<p>In January, 1 759, he learned that his ninety-year-old mother, whom
he had not seen in twenty-two years, was nearing death. He borrowed
money from a printer, and sent her six guineas in a tender letter. She
died on January 23. To pay for her funeral and her debts he wrote in the
evenings of one week (so he told Reynolds) The History of Rasselas,
Prince of Abyssinia. He sent it to the printer part by part, and
received £ 100 for it. On its publica- tion in April the critics hailed
it as a classic, and contrasted it patriotically with Voltaire’s
Candide, which appeared a lmost at the same time and dealt with the same
problem — Can life bring happiness? Johnson did not delay his answer:
“Ye who listen with phantoms of hope, who expect that old age will
perform the promises of youth, and that the deficiencies of the present
day will be supplied by the morrow; attend to the history of Rasselas.”
37</p>
<p>It was the custom of Abyssinian kings (Johnson tells us) to confine
the heir to the throne to a pleasant and fertile valley until the time
came for his accession. Everything was supplied him: a palace, good
food, animal pets, intelligent companions. But in his twenty-sixth year
Rasselas wearies of these delights. He misses not only liberty but
struggle. “I should be happy if I had something to pursue.” He ponders
how he may escape this peaceful valley to see how other men seek and
find happiness.</p>
<p>A skillful mechanic proposes to build a flying machine that will lift
the Prince and himself above the encircling mountains to freedom. He
explains:</p>
<p>He that can swim needs not despair to fly; to swim is to fly in a
grosser fluid, and to fly is to swim in a subtler. We are only to
proportion our power of resistance to the different density of matter
through which we pass. You will be necessarily upborne by the air if you
can renew any impulse upon it faster than the air can recede from the
pressure…. The labor of rising from the ground will be great,… but as we
mount higher, the earth’s attraction,</p>
<p>826</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>Rasselas encourages the mechanic, who agrees to make a plane, “but
only on this condition, that the art shall not be divulged, and that you
shall not re- quire me to make wings for any but ourselves.” “Why,” asks
the Prince, “should you envy others so great an advantage?” “If men were
all virtuous,” the mechanic replies, “I should with great alacrity teach
them to fly. But what would be the security of the good if the bad could
at pleasure invade them from the sky?” He builds a plane, tries to fly,
and falls into a lake, from</p>
<p>Rasselas likes better to talk with Imlac the philosopher, who has
seen many lands and men. They find a cave that leads to a passage into
the outer world; they escape from their paradise, with the Prince’s
sister Nekayah and her maid. Armed with jewels as universal currency,
they visit Cairo, join its pleasures, and tire of them. They hear a
Stoic philosopher discourse on the conquest of passions; a few days
later they find him wild with grief over his daughter’s death. Having
read pastora l poetry, they presume that shepherds must be happy; but
they discover that the hearts of these men are “cankered with
discontent” and with “malevolence toward those that are placed above
them.” 39 They come upon a hermit, and learn that he secretly lon gs for
the delights of the city. They inquire into domestic felicity, and find
every home darkened with discord and “the rude collisions of contrary
desires.” 40 They explore the Pyramids and judge them the summit of
folly. They learn about the happy life of scholars and scientists; they
meet a famous astron- omer, who tells them that “integrity without
knowledge is weak and use - less, and knowledge without integrity is
dangerous and dreadful”; 41 but the astronomer goes mad. They conclude
that no way of life on earth leads to happiness, and Imlac comforts them
with a discourse on the immortality of the soul. They resolve to return
to Abyssinia and accept the vicissitudes of life calmly in the
confidence of a blessed resurrection.</p>
<p>It is an old story in one of its finest incarnations. What amazes us
is the graceful flow and clarity of the style, far removed from the
ponderous vocabulary of Johnson’s essays, and even of his conversation.
It seemed im - possible that the learned lexicographer had written this
simple tale, and quite incredible that he had turned out these 1 41
pages in seven days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had moved again, from Gough Square to Staple Inn</p>
<p>(March 23, 1759); soon he would move to Gray ’s Inn, then to Inner
Tem - ple Lane. These changes were probably motivated by economy; but in
July, 1762, Johnson was suddenly lifted into relative affluence by a
pension of £ 300 a year granted him by George III on the advice of Lord
Bute. Why this beneficence fell upon a man who had persistently opposed
the Han- overian dynasty, had belabored the Scots at every turn, and had
described a pension as “pay given to a state hireling for treason to his
country,” has been the subject of many mystery stori es. Johnson’s
enemies charged him with preferring money to principle, and assumed that
Bute was looking for a mighty pen to answer Wilkes, Churchill, and
others who were denigrating him with ink. Johnson claimed that he had
accepted the pension on the ex- plicit understanding, twice confirmed by
Bute, that he would not be asked</p>

<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>827</p>
<p>o write in support of the government. 42 He confided to Boswell that
“the - sion many times over, not so much by the political tracts of
later years, but by enriching English literature with pen and speech,
with wisdom and cleansing wit.</p>
<p>He had enough friends to afford a scattering of enemies.
“Friendship,” he said, “is the cordial drop to make the nauseous draft
of life go down.” 44 In almost every gathering that he attended he
became the center of conversa- tion, not so much because he forced his
way to it, but because he was the most individual personality in the
literary circles of London, and could be relied upon to say something
whenever he spoke. It was Reynolds who suggested the formation of “the
Club,” which Boswell later called “the Literary Club”; Johnson seconded
the motion, and on April 16, 1764, the new group began its Monday-
evening meetings at the Turk’s Head in Gerrard Street, Soho. The
original members were Reynolds, Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, Christo- pher
Nugent, Topham Beauclerk, Bennet Langton, Anthony Chamier, and Sir John
Hawkins. Others were added later by vote of the Club: Gibbon, Garrick,
Sheridan, Fox, Adam Smith, Dr. Burney…</p>
<p>Boswell did not win admission till 1773, partly, it may be, because
he was only occasionally in London. During the twenty-one years between
his meeting with Johnson and Johnson’s death, he spent no more than two
years and a few weeks within reach of his idol. The unconcealed warmth
of his admiration, and Johnson’s awareness that Boswell was planning a
biography of him, made the older man forgive the Scot’s almost
sycophantic idolatry. A good talker and a good listener make a happy
couple. Johnson had no high regard for Boswell’s brains. When “Bozzy,”
as he called him, remarked that the wine he had drunk in the course of
their conversation had given him a headache, Johnson corrected him:
“Nay, sir, it was not the wine that made your head ache, but the s ense
that I put into it.” “What, sir,” Boswell ex - claimed, “will sense make
the head ache?” “Yes, sir, when it is not used to it.” 45 (There are
passages in the Life where Boswell seems to be talking bet - ter sense
than Johnson.) Praising Pope’s Duncia d, Johnson noted that it had given
some dunces a lasting fame, and continued his fun: “It was worth</p>
<p>On March 31 , 1772, he wrote in his journal: “I have constant plan to
write the life of Mr. Johnson. I have not told him of it yet, nor do I
know if I should tell him.” But Johnson knew of it by April, 1773, if
not sooner. 50 Others knew of it, and resented Boswell ’s way of raising
controversial ques - tions with the evident aim of drawing the old
master out and getting some new gem for the biography. The inquisitive
Scot boasted that “the fountain</p>
<p>8z8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>was at times locked up till I opened the spring.” 51 The Johnson that
we know and relish might never have taken form without the stimulus of
Bos- well’s fond provocation and tireless pursuit. How different is the
Johnson that we find in Hawkins’ Life, o r even in the lively Anecdotes
of Mrs. Thrale!</p>
<p>It was in January, 1765, that Johnson began with the Thrales an
associa- tion that played a larger part in his life than his friendship
for Boswell. Henry Thrale was a brewer, son of a brewer. He had received
a good edu- cation, had traveled, and was to certify his status by being
elected to Parlia- ment. In 1763 he married Hester Lynch Salusbury, a
Welsh girl only five feet tall but vivacious and intelligent. Henry,
twelve years her senior, ab- sorbed himself in his business, but
attended to his wife sufficiently to make her pregnant annually between
1764 and 1778, and to convey to her his venereal infection. 52 She bore
him twelve children, of whom eight died in infancy. She solaced herself
with literature, and when her husband brought home with him the famous
Samuel Johnson, she used all her feminine arts and graces to attach him
to the family. Soon he was dining with the Thrales every Thursday in
their Southwark home; and from 1766 onward he usually spent the summer
with them in their country villa at Streatham in Surrey. With Johnson as
a center, Mrs. Thrale made her home a salon, to which came Reynolds,
Goldsmith, Garrick, Burke, the Burneys, and finally and jealously
Boswell — for he learned that Mrs. Thrale was gathering notes about her
lion’s looks and ways and words. So the Life was to have a rival.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>URSUS MAJOR</li>
</ol>
<p>What was the Great Bear like? Boswell, after their first meeting
(1763) wrote: “Mr. Jo hnson is a man of a most dreadful appearance…. A
very big man, troubled with sore eyes, the palsy [a nervous tic] and the
king’s evil. He is very slovenly in his dress, and speaks with a most
uncouth voice.” 53 Mrs. Thrale described him in his later years: “His
stature was re - markably high, and his limbs exceedingly large…. His
features strongly marked, his countenance particularly rugged…. His
sight was near, and otherwise imperfect; yet his eyes… were so wild, so
piercing, and at times so fierce, that fear was, I believe, the first
emotion in the eyes of all his beholders.” 54</p>
<p>He deplored as “a waste of time” the hours spent in sitting for a
portrait; however, he did this ten times for Reynolds, and once for a
bust by Nolle- kens. In 1756 Sir Joshua showed him as already stout and
indolent; 55 in 1770 he painted him in profile and made him look like
Goldsmith; 56 in 1772 tbe most famous of the portraits delivered him to
posterity as a man of ungainly bulk, enormous wig, large full face,
lowering brows over puzzled eyes, mas- sive nose, thick lips, and double
chin. His wig was repeatedly dislodged by convulsive movements of his
head, shoulders, and hands. 57 He was careless in his dress; “fine
clothes,” he told Boswell, “a re good only as they supply the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIII ) SAMUEL JOHNSON 829</p>
<p>want of other means of procuring respect.” 58 Not until he became a
guest of the Thrales did he bother much about personal hygiene.</p>
<p>He ate voraciously, having much space to fill, and perhaps recalling
hun- gry years. Boswell reported:</p>
<p>I never knew any man who relished good eating more than he did. When
at table he was totally absorbed in the business of the moment; his
looks seemed riveted to his plate; nor would he, unless when in very
high company, say one word, or pay the least attention to what was said
by others, till he had satisfied his appetite; which was so fierce… that
the veins of his forehead swelled, and generally a strong perspiration
was visible. 59</p>
<p>He ate fish with his fingers, “because I am shortsighted, and afraid
of bones.” 80 He could hardly bear the sight of vegetables. In his
heartier days he “loved to exhilarate himself with wine, but was never
in toxicated but once.” 81 When Mrs. Williams denounced drunkenness,
saying, “I wonder what pleasure men can take in making beasts of
themselves,” Johnson re - torted, “I wonder, madam, that you have not
penetration enough to see the strong inducement to this excess, for he
who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.” 82
But drinking, he said, “does not improve conversation; it alters the
mind so that you are pleased with any conversa- tion.” 83 In later life
he shunned all liquor, and contented himself with choco- late, lemonade,
and countless cups of tea. He never smoked. “It is a shocking thing,
blowing smoke out of our mouths into other people’s mouths, eyes, and
noses, and having the same thing done to us.” He explained the habit of
smoking as “preserving the mind from utter vacuity.” 84</p>
<p>His boorish manners were partly a relic of his days and nights in the
lower depths, partly the result of physical irritations and mental
fears. He was strong, and proud of it; he could knock down a bookseller
with little fear of retaliation; he could pick up and throw aside a man
who had dared to occupy a chair that Johnson had temporarily vacated; he
mounted a horse and joined Thrale in a fifty-mile cross-country foxhunt.
But he had diffi- culty in carrying his own weight. “When he walked the
streets, what with the constant roll of his head, and the concomitant
motion of his body, he appeared to make his way by that motion,
independent of his feet.” 85 When he rode “he had no command or
direction of his horse, but was carried as if in a balloon.” 88</p>
<p>He suffered, after 1776, from asthma, gout, and dropsy. These and
other physical difficulties must have intensified his melancholy, which
at times so depressed him that “I would consent to have a limb amputated
to recover my spirits.” 87 He would not believe that any man was happy;
of one who claimed to be so he said, “It is all cant; the dog knows he
is miserable a ll the time.” 88 A physician having told him that
hypochondria sometimes led to in - sanity, Johnson feared that he would
go insane. 89 “Of the uncertainties of our present state,” he made Imlac
say in Rasselas, “the most dreadful and alarming is the un certain
continuance of reason.” 70</p>
<p>Being nearsighted, he found little pleasure in the beauty of women,
na- ture, or art. 71 He thought sculpture was overrated. “The value of
statuary</p>
<p>830</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the finest head cut
upon a carrot.” 72 He tried to learn some musical instrument, “but I
never made out a tune.” “Pray, sir,” he asked, “who is this Bach? Is he
a piper?” 73 — referring to Johann Christian Bach, then (1771) the most
famous pianist in England. He felt that music was being spoiled by
digital acrobatics. Hearing a violin- ist praised because the feats he
performed were so difficult, Johnson ex- claimed, “Difficult— I wish it
had been imposs ible.” 74</p>
<p>So vigorous a man must have found it troublesome to deal with the
sexual fancies that agitate even the normal mind. When he attended the
premiere of Irene, and was brought by Garrick into the “greenroom” where
the players waited between scenes, he rejected a suggestion that he
repeat this visit. “No, David, I will never come back. For the white
bubbies and the silk stockings of your actresses excite my genitals.” 75
Boswell was astonished to hear him say, one day in the Hebrides, “I have
o ften thought that if I kept a seraglio…” 76</p>
<p>In general his faults were more obvious than his virtues, which were
quite as real. We might justly invert Horace Walpole’s comment that
“though he was good-natured at bottom he was very ill- natured at top.”
77 Goldsmith said the same thing more graciously: “Johnson has a
roughness in his man - ner, but no man alive has a more tender heart. He
has nothing of the bear but the skin.” 78 Untidy, indole nt,
superstitious, rude, dogmatic, proud, he was also kind, humane,
generous, quick to ask forgiveness and to forgive. Mrs. Thrale reckoned
that Johnson gave away £200 of his £ 300 pension; 79 and she added:</p>
<p>He nursed whole nests of people in his house…. Commonly spending the
middle of the week at our house, he kept his numerous family in Fleet
Street upon a settled allowance, but returned to them every Saturday to
give them three good dinners, and his company, before he came back to us
on the Monday night — treating them with the same, or perhaps more
ceremonious civility than he would have done by as many people of
fashion. 80</p>
<p>He wrote prefaces, dedications, sermons, even legal opinions, for
others, often gratis. He labored by word and pen to save Dr. William
Dodd from the gallows. Seeing a prostitute lying in the street he (then
seventy-five) took her on his back, carried her to his rooms, cared for
her till she was well, and “endeavored to put her in a virtuous way of
living.” 81 Geor ge Steevens, who collaborated with him in editing
Shakespeare, said: “Could the many bounties he studiously concealed, the
many acts of humanity he performed in private, be displayed with equal
circumstantiality [as his frailties], his de- fects would be so far lost
in the blaze of his virtues that the latter only would be regarded.”
82</p>
<p>In the last nineteen years of his life he wrote only one substantial
book — Lives of the Poets; otherwise he substituted the tongue for the
pen. He de- scribed himself as “a man who loves to fold his legs and
have out his talk.” 83 If we leave eating aside, he lived most when he
was talking to an intelligent company. He had gathered, by observation
and reading, an extraordinary fund and range of knowledge about human
affairs; he carried much of it in his lumber room of memory, and he
welcomed a chance to unburden him-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>8 3 I</p>
<p>self. Yet he seldom initiated any serious discussion; he spoke up
only when someone raised a subject or a challenge. He was always tempted
to oppose what another had said; he was ready to defend any proposition
or its op- posite; he relished debate, knowing himself invincible; and
he was resolved to win the argument, even if truth should perish beneath
his blows. He knew that this was not the finest kind of conversation,
but he was sure that it was the most interesting. In the heat and zest
of the conflict he found little place for courtesy. “He spared none of
us,” said Boswell. 84 To one disputant: “I have found you an argument,
but I am not obliged to find you an under- standing.” 85 “There is no
arguing with Johnson,” said Goldsmith; “for if his pistol misses fire he
knocks you down with the butt.” 86 “When I called upon Dr. Johnson next
morning,” Boswell relates, “I found him highly satisfied with his
colloquial powers the preceding evening. ‘Well (said he), we had a good
talk.’ Boswell. ‘Yes, Sir, you tossed and gored several persons.’” 87
Thomas Sheridan called him a bully , 88 and Gibbon called him a bigot.
89 Lord Monboddo called him “the most invidious and malignant man I have
ever known, who praised no author or book that other people praised [he
praised Fanny Burney’s Evelina ], and… could not with any patience hear
any other person draw the attention of the company for ever so short a
time.” 90 Horace Walpole, secure in his sinecures, shuddered at thought
of him, and summed him up as seen by the son of a Whig prime
minister:</p>
<p>With a lumber of learning and some strong points, Johnson was an
odious and mean character. By principle a Jacobite, arrogant,
self-sufficient, and over- bearing…. He had prostituted his pen to party
even in a dictionary, and had afterwards, for a pension, contradicted
his own definitions. His manners were sordid, supercilious, and brutal,
his style ridiculously bombastic and vicious, and in one word, with all
the pedantry he had all the gigantic littleness of a country
schoolmaster…. What will posterity think of us when it reads what an
idol we adored ? 91</p>
<p>Ideally, of course, the best conversation is in a small unhurried
group where all are informed and courteous; or, as Johnson put it in an
amiable in- terlude: “That is the happiest conversation where there is
no competition, no vanity, but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments”;
92 but when did he have that experience? “Treating your adversary with
respect,” he told Boswell, presumably with a twinkle in his eyes, “is
giving him an advantage to which he is not entitled.” 93 We who never
felt his butt forgive him all those blows and insults and prejudices
because his wit and humor and penetration, his preference of realities
to pretenses, of candor to cant, and his capacity for concentrating
wisdom in a phrase, make him one of the most dominating characters in
English history.</p>
<p>V. THE CONSERVATIVE MIND</p>
<p>Shall we give him the floor? He had something interesting to say on
al- most everything under the sun. He thought life a misfortune which no
one would want to repeat, and which most people “supported with
impatience and quitted with reluctance.” 94 When Lady McLeod asked him
“if no man</p>
<p>832 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>was naturally good,” he answered, “No, madam, no more than a wolf.”
95 “Men are evidently… so corrupt that all the laws of heaven and earth
are insufficient to restrain them from crimes.” 96 “Men hate more
sturdily than they love; and if I have said something to hurt a man
once, I shall not get the better of t his by saying many things to
please him.” 97</p>
<p>He did not often discuss economics. He denounced the exploitation of
colonial peoples, 98 and strongly condemned slavery; once, at Oxford, he
astonished some professors by proposing a toast to “the insurrect ion of
the Negroes in the West Indies.” 99 However, he thought that “raising
the wages of day laborers is wrong; for it does not make them live
better, but [said the Idler] only makes them idler, and idleness is a
very bad thing for human nature.” 100 Like Blackstone, he upheld the
sanctity of property rights; and like his antipodes, Voltaire, he
defended luxury as giving work to the poor, instead of corroding them
with charity. 101 He anticipated Adam Smith in advocating free
enterprise. 102 But the multiplication of merchants irritated him. “I am
afraid the increase of commerce, and the incessant struggle for riches
which commerce excites, gives no prospect of an end speedily to be
expected of artifice and fraud…. Violence gives way to cunning.” 103 He
made no pretense of despising money, having suffered from its lack, and
he thought that “no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money” 104
— which underestimated vanity.</p>
<p>He felt (recall the lines he added to Goldsmith’s T raveller) that
we</p>
<p>exaggerate the importance of politics. “I would not give half a crown
to live under one form of government rather than another.” 105 Hence
“most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things.” 106
Yet he had been hot agai nst the “Whig dogs,” and it took a pension to
reconcile him to the Hanoverians. He called patriotism “the last refuge
of a scoundrel,” 107 but he defended with patriotic warmth the right of
Britain to the Falkland Islands (1771), and he had an almost
chauvinistic scorn of the Scots and the French.</p>
<p>He quite anticipated, in 1763, Burke’s apologia for conservatism.
“Human experience, which is constantly contradicting theory, is the
great test of truth. A system built on the discoveries of a great many
minds is always of more strength than what is produced by the mere
workings of any one mind.” 108 After 1762 he was quite content with the
status quo. He praised the British government as “approaching nearer to
perfection than anything that experience has shown us, or history
related.” 109 He admired aristocracy and class distinctions and
privileges as necessary for social order and prudent legislation. 110 “I
am a friend to subordination. It is most conducive to the happiness of
society…. Submission is the duty of the ignorant, and con- tent the
virtue of the poor.” 111 He mourned, like every generation, that</p>
<p>subordination is sadly broken down in this age. No man now has the
same authority which his father had — except a gaoler. No master has it
over his serv- ants; it is diminished in our colleges, nay, in our
grammar schools…. There are many causes, the chief of which is, I think,
the great increase of money…. Gold and silver destroy feudal
subordination. But, besides, there is a gen-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>833</p>
<p>eral relaxation of reverence. No son now depends upon his father, as
in former times…. My hope is that as anarchy produces tyranny, this
extreme relaxa- tion will produce freni strictio [a tightening of the
reins ]. 112</p>
<p>Contemplating the London populace, Johnson judged that democracy
would be a disaster. He laughed at liberty and equality as impracticable
shibboleths. 113 “So far is it from being true that men are naturally
equal, that no two people can be half an hour together but one shall
acquire an evident superiority over the other.” 114 In 1770 he wrote a
pamphlet, The False Alarm, condemning radicalism, and justifying the
exclusion of Wilkes from Parliament.</p>
<p>In another pamphlet, The Patriot (1774), Johnson renewed his attack
on Wilkes, and moved on to what Boswell called “an attempt to reduce our
fellow subjects in America to unconditional sub mission.” 115 In earlier
writings Johnson had spoken with occasional impartiality on the American
colonies. These had been “snatched upon no very just principles of
policy,” largely because other European states were snatching too much,
116 and England wished to protect herself from a France and a Spain made
dangerously strong by absorbing America. He had praised the French
colonists for treat- ing the Indians humanely and intermarrying with
them, and he had con- demned the British colonists for defrauding the
Indians and oppressing the Negroes. 117 But when the colonists talked of
liberty, justice, and natural rights, Johnson scorned their claims as
specious cant, and asked, “How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for
liberty among the drivers o f Negroes?” 118 He stated the case against
the emancipation of the colonies in a powerful brochure, Taxation No
Tyranny (1775). This was apparently written at the request of the
ministry, for Johnson complained (says Boswell) that his pension had
been given him “as a literary character,” and now he had been “applied
by the administiation to write political pamphlets.” 119</p>
<p>By accepting the protection of Great Britain (Johnson argued) the
colo- nists had implicitly recognized the right of the British
government to tax them. Taxation, to be just, did not require the direct
representation of the taxed persons in the government; half the
population of England was with- out representatives in Parliament, and
yet it accepted taxation as a fair return for the social order and legal
protection provided by the government. Haw- kins, who had supplied
Johnson with arguments, 120 thought that Taxation No Tyranny “has never
received an answer,” 121 but Boswell, remembering Corsica, took the
American side, deplored the “extreme violence” of John - son’s pen, and
said: “That this pamphlet was written at the desire of those who were
then in power I have no doubt; and indeed he owned to me that it had bee
n revised and curtailed by some of them.” 122 One passage deleted by the
ministry predicted that the Americans would, “in a century and a
quarter, be more than equal to the inhabitants of [Western] Europe.” 123
There were some liberal elements in his political philosophy. He
preferred Fox to Pitt II, and was induced to dine with Wilkes, who
overcame John- son’s political principles by helping him to some fine
veal. 124 And in one pas - sage the old Tory flirted with

<p>834 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>When we consider in abstracted speculation the unequal distribution
of the pleasures of life,… when it is apparent that many want the
necessaries of nature, and many more the comforts and conveniences of
life; that the idle live at ease by the fatigues of the diligent, and
the luxurious are pampered with delicacies untasted by those who supply
them;… when the greater number must always want [lack] what the smaller
are enjoying and squandering without use; it seems impossible to
conceive that the peace of society can long subsist; it were natural to
expect that no man would be left long in possession of super- fluous
enjoyments while such numbers are destitute of real necessaries. 125</p>
<p>His conservatism returned to full force when he spoke of religion.
After a youthful year of skepticism 126 he gave increasingly ardent
support to the doctrines and privileges of the Established Church.
Sometimes he inclined to Catholicism: he liked the idea of purgatory,
and when he heard that an Anglican clergyman had been converted to the
Roman Church he said, “God bless him !” 127 “He defended the
Inquisition,” Boswell tells us, “and maintained that false doctrine
should be checked on its first appearance; that the civil power should
unite with the Church in punishing those who dare to attack the
established religion, and that such only were punished by the In-
quisition.” 128 He hated Dissenters, and applauded the expulsion of
Methodists from Oxford. 129 He refused to speak to a lady who left the
Established Church to join the Quakers. 130 He reproved Boswell for his
mild friendship with the “atheist” Hume. When Adam Smith assured him
that Hume led an exemplary life, Johnson cried out, “You lie!” To wh ich
Smith retorted, “You are a son of a bitch.” 131 Johnson felt that
religion was indispensable to social order and morality, and that only
the hope of a happy immortality could reconcile one to the tribulations
of earthly life. He believed in angels and devils, and thought that “we
are all to reside hereafter either in the regions of horror or bliss.”
132 He accepted the reality of witches and ghosts; he believed that his
dead wife had appeared to him. 133</p>
<p>He did not care for science; he praised Socrates for trying to turn
investi- gation from the stars to man. 134 He abhorred vivisection. He
took no interest in exploration; the discovery of unknown lands would
only lead to “con - quest and robbery.” 135 He thought philosophy was an
intellectual labyrinth leading either to religious doubt or to
metaphysical nonsense. So he refuted Berkeley’s idealism by kicking a
stone, and defended free will by telling Boswell, “We know our will is
free, and there’s an end on ’t…. All the - ory is against the freedom of
the will, all experience for it.” 136</p>
<p>He rejected with disgust the whole philosophy of the French
Enlighten- ment. He denied the right of an individual mind, however
brilliant, to sit in judgment on institutions that the trial-and-error
experience of the race had built up to protect social order against the
unsocial impulses of men. He felt that the Catholic Church, with all its
faults, was performing a vital function in preserving French
civilization, and he condemned as shallow fools the philosophes who were
weakening the religious supports of the moral code. Voltaire and
Rousseau seemed to him two varieties of imbecile: Voltaire an
intellectual fool, Rousseau a sentimental fool; but the difference
between them was so slight that it was “difficult to settle the
proportion of iniquity</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>835</p>
<p>between them.” 137 He reproved Boswell for courting Rousseau in
Switzer - land, and deplored the hospitality that England was offering
the author of Smile (17 66). “Rousseau, Sir, is a very bad man. I would
sooner sign a sen - tence for his transportation than that of any felon
who has gone from the Old Bailey these many years. Yes, Sir, I should
like to have him work in the plantations.” 138</p>
<p>Johnson was not as conservative as his opinions. He gaily broke a
hundred conventions in conduct, speech, and dress. He was not a prig; he
laughed at the Puritans, he favored dancing, cardplaying, the theater.
However, he con- demned Fielding’s Tom Jones, and was shocked to hear
that prim Hannah</p>
<p>In 1765 he moved from the Inner Temple to a three-story house at
No. 7 Johnson’s Court in Fleet Street; it was named after an earlier
resident. There Boswell found him on returning from the Continent. In
July he was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the
University of Dublin; now for the first time he was Dr. Johnson, but he
never attached the title to his name. 140</p>
<p>In October, 1765, he issued in eight volumes his edition of
Shakespeare, eight years later than he had promised it to his
subscribers. He dared to point out faults, absurdities, and childish
verbal conceits in the Bard; he censured him for having no mor al
purpose; he thought that Shakespeare had left “per - haps not one play
which, if it were now exhibited as the work of a contem- porary writer,
would be heard to the conclusion.” 141 But he praised the poet for
subordinating the love interest in the greater dramas, and for making
his protagonists not heroes but men; and he vigorously defended, against
Vol- taire, Shakespeare’s neglect of the unities of time and place. 142
Critics chal - lenged many of his comments and corrections; the edition
was superseded by Edmund Malone’s in 1790; but Malone acknowledged that
his own edi - tion was based on Johnson’s, and he overvalued Johnson’s
preface as “per - haps the finest composition in our language.” 143</p>
<p>In 1767, while visiting Buckingham Palace, Johnson came upon George
III; they exchanged compliments. Meanwhile the friendship with Boswell
warmed to such a degree that in 1773 Johnson accepted his admirer’s
invita - tion to join him in a tour of the Hebrides. It was a brave
undertaking for a man of sixty-four. It began with a long and arduous
stagecoach ride from London to Edinburgh. There he met Robertson, but
refused to meet Hume. On August 18 he and Boswell and a servant started
north in a post chaise</p>
<p>836</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>along the east coast to Aberdeen; thence they struck across the
rugged High- lands through Banff to Inverness, and then mostly on
horseback through Anoch to Glenelg on the west coast. There they took a
boat to the island of Skye, which they toured rather thoroughly from
September 2 to October 3. They encountered many hardships, which Johnson
took with glum courage; he slept upon hay in bams, evaded vermin,
clambered over rocks, and rode with precarious dignity on ponies hardly
larger than himself. At one stop a lady of the Macdonald clan sat on his
knee and kissed him. “Do it again,” he said, “and let us see who will
tire first.” 144 On October 3 the party left by open boat for a
forty-mile ride to the island of Coll and thence to the island of Mull.
They crossed back to the mainland on October 22, and then traveled
through Argyllshire via Dumbarton and Glasgow to Auchinleck (Novem- ber
2). There Johnson met Boswell’s father, who entertained him honorably,
though lamenting his anti-Scot prejudices; they had a debate so violent
that Boswell refused to record it. Boswell Senior afterward dubbed
Johnson “Ursa Major,” which the son gracefully interpreted as meaning
not Great Bear but “a constellation of genius and learning.” 145 Th e
travelers reached Edinburgh November 9, eighty-three days after leaving
it. Looking back upon their hardships, they “heartily laughed at the
ravings of those absurd visionaries who have attempted to persuade us of
the specious advantages of a state o f nature.” Johnson left Edinburgh
November 22, and reached Lon - don on the twenty-sixth. In 1775 he
published A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland; it was not as
racy as even the bowdlerized account that Boswell issued in 1785 as A
Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, for philosophy is
less interesting than biography; but some pas- sages 146 have a placid
beauty that reveal Johnson again as a master of English prose.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1775, Oxford finally came around to giving Johnson the
hon- orary degree of Doctor of Civil Law. In March, 1776, he moved for
the last time, to No. 8 Bolt Court, taking his motley family with him.
In a strange mood of exuberance he wrote to the Lord Chamberlain (April
11, 1776) asking for an apartment in Hampton Court Palace: “I hope that
to a man who has had the honor of vindicating his Majesty’s government,
a retreat in one of his houses may not be improperly or unworthily
allowed.” 147 The Lord Chamberlain regretted that there was a surfeit of
applicants.</p>
<p>One more achievement remained. Forty London booksellers joined in
pre- paring a many-volumed edition of the English poets, and asked
Johnson to introduce each poet with a biography. They let him name his
terms; he re- quired £ 200; had he “asked one thousand, or even fifteen
hundred guineas,” said Malone, “the booksellers, who knew the value of
his name, would doubtless have readily given it.” 148 Johnson had
thought of writing “little lives”; he forgot that one of the laws of
composition is that a pen in motion, like matter in Newton’s first law,
continues in motion unless it is compelled to change that state by
forces impressed upon it from without. Of the minor poets he wrote with
laudable brevity, but with Milton, Addison, and Pope he let himself go,
and wrote essays — of sixty, forty-two, 102 pages — that are among the
finest specimens of literary criticism in the English language.</p>

<p>His view of Milton was colored by his dislike of the Puritans, their
poli- tics, and their regicide. He read Milton’s prose as well as his
verse, and called</p>

</ol>
<p>There is a secret pride in surviving our contemporaries, but we are
pun- ished with loneliness. The death of Henry Thrale (April 4, 1781)
was the beginning of the end for Johnson. He served as one of four
executors of the brewer’s will, but thereafter h is visits to the Thrale
family lessened. Long be- fore her husband’s death Mrs. Thrale had begun
to weary of the strains put upon her by Johnson’s need for attentions
and attentive ears. Thrale had kept his captive bear in reasonably good
behavior, but (the widow com- plained), “when there was nobody to
restrain his [Johnson’s] dislikes it was extremely difficult to find
anybody with whom he could converse without living always on the verge
of a quarrel…. Such accidents occurred too often, and I was forced… to
retire to Bath, where I knew Mr. Johnson would not follow me.” 152</p>
<p>The Morning Post made matters worse by announcing that a treaty of
marriage between Johnson and Mrs. Thrale was “on tap.” 153 Boswell com -
posed a burlesque “Ode by Samuel Johnson to Mrs. Thrale upon Their Sup-
posed Approaching Nuptials.” 154 But in 1782 Johnson was seventy -three
and Mrs. Thrale was forty-one. It was not of her own will that she had
married Thrale; he had often neglected her, and she had never learned to
love him. Now she claimed a right to love and be loved, and to find a
mate for the sec- ond half of her life. She was at an age when a woman
urgently longs for some physical and understanding companionship. Even
before her husband’s death she had developed a fondness for Gabriel
Piozzi, who was giving mu- sic lessons to her daughters. Born in Italy,
he had taken up residence in Eng- land in 1776, and was now about
forty-two years old. When she first met</p>
<p>8 3 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>him, at a party given by Dr. Burney, she mimicked his mannerisms as
he per- formed at the piano. But his elegant manners, his amiable
temper, and his musical accomplishments made him a relieving contrast to
Johnson. Now that she was free she abandoned herself to romance. She
confessed to her four surviving daughters her desire for remarriage.
They were alarmed; re- marriage would affect their financial
expectations; marriage to a musician — worse yet, a Roman Catholic —
would hurt their social standing. They pleaded with their mother to
reconsider; she tried and failed. Piozzi behaved like a gentleman: he
went off to Italy (April, 1783), and stayed away almost a year. When he
returned (March, 1784) and found Mrs. Thrale still eager, he yielded.
The daughters refused their consent, and moved to Brighton.</p>
<p>On June 3 o Mrs. Thrale sent Johnson an announcement that she and
Piozzi were to be married. He replied (July 2, 1784):</p>
<p>Madam:</p>
<p>If I interpret your letter aright, you are ignominiously married; if
it is yet undone, let us once more talk together. If you have abandoned
your children and your religion, God forgive your wickedness; if you
have forfeited your fame [reputation] and your country, may your folly
do no further mischief. If the last act is yet to do, I, who have loved
you, esteemed you, reverenced you, and served you, I who long thought
you the first of womankind, entreat that, before your fate is
irrevocable, I may once more see you.</p>
<p>I was, I once was, Madam, most truly yours,</p>
<p>Sam. Johnson 155</p>
<p>Mrs. Thrale resented the word “ignominious” as a slur on her fiance.
She an - swered Johnson on July 4: “Till you have changed your opinion
of Mr. Piozzi let us converse n o more.” She married Piozzi on July 23.
All Lon - don agreed with Johnson in condemning her. On November 1 1
Johnson told Fanny Burney, “I never speak of her, and I desire never to
hear of her more.” 156</p>
<p>These events must have taken a toll of Johnson’s failing vitality. He
found it increasingly difficult to sleep, and resorted to opium to ease
his pains and quiet his nerves. On January 16, 1782, his “doctor in
ordinary,” Robert Levett, died; whose turn would it be next? Johnson had
always feared death; now this and his belief in hell made his final
years a mixture of heavy dinners and theological terrors. “I am afraid I
may be one of those who shall be damned,” he told Dr. William Adams,
master of Pembroke College; and when Adams asked what he meant by
“damned” he cried out, “Sent to hell, sir, and punished everlastingly.”
157 Boswell could not help contrasting the calm with which the
unbelieving Hume had approached his end. 158</p>
<p>On June 17, 1783, Johnson suffered a mild stroke — “a confusion and
indis - tinctness in my head, which lasted, I suppose, half a minute….
My speech was taken from me. I had no pain.” 159 A week later he was
well enough to dine at the Club, and in July he astonished his intimates
by making excur- sions to Rochester and Salisbury. “What a man am I,” he
exclaimed to Haw - kins, “who have got the better of three diseases— the
palsy, the gout, and the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl) SAMUEL JOHNSON 839</p>
<p>asthma — and can now enjoy the conversation of my fri ends!” 160 But
on Sep - tember 6 Mrs. Williams died, and his loneliness became
intolerable. Finding the Club insufficient — for several of the old
members (Goldsmith, Garrick, Beauclerk) were dead, and some of the new
ones were distasteful to him — he fou nded (December, 1783) the “Evening
Club,” which met at an ale - house in Essex Street; there any decent
person, by paying threepence, might come in and hear him talk, three
nights a week. He invited Reynolds to join; Sir Joshua refused. Hawkins
and other s thought the new club a “degrada - tion of those powers which
had given delight” to more august persons. 161 On June 3, 1784, he was
well enough to journey with Boswell to Lichfield and Oxford. Returning
to London, Boswell persuaded Reynolds and other friends to ask the
Chancellor to provide money whereby Johnson might be enabled to take a
trip to Italy for his health; Johnson said he would prefer a doubling of
his pension. The Chancellor refused. On July 2 Boswell left for
Scotland. He never saw Johnson again.</p>
<p>The asthma that had been overcome returned, and dropsy was added. “My
breath is very short,” he wrote to Boswell in November, 1784, “and the
water is now increasing upon me.” 162 Reynolds, Burke, Langton, Fanny
Burney, and others came to bid him a last goodbye. He wrote his will; he
left £ 2,000, of which £ 1,500 were bequeathed to his Negro servant. 163
Several doctors treated him, refusing any fee. He begged them to lance
his legs more deeply; they would not; when they were gone he plunged
lancets or scissors deep into his calves, hoping to release more water
and reduce the painful swelling; some water came, but also ten ounces of
blood. That evening, De- cember 1 3, 1784, he died. A week later he was
buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>He was the strangest figure in literary history, stranger even than
Scarron or Pope. It is at first acquaintance hard to like him; he
covered his tenderness with brutality, and the coarseness of his manners
rivaled the propriety of his books. No one received so much adulation
and gave so little praise. But the older we become, the more wisdom we
find in his words. He surrounded his wisdom with platitudes, but he
elevated platitudes to epigrams by the force or color of his speech. We
might compare him with Socrates, who also talked at the slightest
provocation, and is remembered for his spoken words. Both were
stimulating gadflies, but Socrates asked questions and gave no answers,
Johnson asked no questions and answered all. Socrates was certain about
nothing, Johnson was certain about everything. Both appealed to science
to leave the stars alone and study man. Socrates faced death like a
philosopher and with a smile; Johnson faced it with religious tremors
rivaling his enervat- ing pains.</p>
<p>No one now idealizes him. We can understand why the English aristoc-
racy-excepting Langton and Beauclerk — avoided him and ignored his pon-
tificate. We realize what a John Bull he would have been in the china
shop of the nobility, or amid the precious bric-a-brac of Strawberry
Hill. He was not designed for beauty, but he served to frighten some of
us out of cant, hypocrisy, and gush, and to make us look at ourselves
with fewer delusions about the nature of man or the ecstasies of
freedom. There must have been</p>
<p>840</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>something lovable in a man to whom Reynolds and Burke and Goldsmith
could listen through a thousand and one nights, and something
fascinating in one who could inspire a great biography, and fill its
twelve hundred pages with enduring life.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">

</ol>
<p>When the Great Bear was dead the literary flock swarmed about him to
draw some sustenance from his corpse. Boswell himself did not hurry; he
worked for seven years on the Life; but he issued in 1785 his Journal of
a T our to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson; it reached a third edition
in one year. Hester Thrale Piozzi had gathered material about Johnson’s
words and ways; now, from these Thraliana, she compiled Anecdotes of the
Late Sam- uel Johnson, LL.D., during the Last Twenty Years of His Life
(1786). The little book presented a less amiable picture of her guest
than she had drawn day by day in her diary; doubtless the final letters
of Johnson had left a last- ing wound.</p>
<p>Next in the arena — barring a dozen entries now forgotten — was The
Life of Samuel Johnson, published in five sumptuous volumes by Sir John
Haw- kins in 1787. Hawkins had had sufficient success as an attorney to
be knighted (1772), and sufficient learning to write a good History of
Music (1776). He joined with Johnson in organizing the Ivy Lane Club
(1749), and was one of the original members of “the Club.” He left this
after an ar - gument with Burke, which caused Johnson to dub him “an
unclubbable man”; but Johnson remained his friend, often sought his
advice, and ap - pointed him one of the executors of his will. Soon
after Johnson’s death a group of booksellers asked Hawkins to edit an
edition of the Doctor’s w orks, and to introduce it with a biography.
This was criticized as revealing John- son’s faults without mercy, and
Boswell later questioned its accuracy; but “the charges against it
cannot be sustained in a fair hearing.” 164 Nearly all the faults
ascribed to Johnson by Hawkins were noted by other contempo- raries.</p>
<p>Mrs. Piozzi returned to the feast with Letters to and from the Late
Sam- uel Johnson (1788), all fascinating, for Johnson’s letters (except
the last one</p>

<p>SAMUEL JOHNSON</p>
<p>841</p>
<p>when Boswell, broken down by dissipation, grief, and the death of his
wife, seemed about to abandon himself to women and drink. Boswell wrote
in 1789: “You cannot imagine what labor, what perplexity, what vexation
I have endured in arranging a prodigious multiplicity of materials, in
supply- ing omissions, in searching for papers buried in different
masses, and all this besides the exertion of composing and polishing.
Many a time have I thought of giving it up.” 165 He took from William
Mason’s Life cmd Letters of Gray (1774) the idea of interspersing his
hero’s letters with the story. He deliber - ately accumulated details,
feeling that these would add up to a full and vivid picture. The
fragments were woven into a chronological narrative -and a consistent
whole.</p>
<p>Was he accurate? He claimed to be. “I am so nice in recording him
that - tim. A comparison of his Notebook with the Life shows that
Boswell turned his own summary of Johnson’s speech into direct
quotation, which he some - times expanded, sometimes compressed,
sometimes improved, 167 sometimes purified, elongating certain
four-letter words to respectable proportions. Oc- casionally he omitted
facts unfavorable to himself. 168 He did not claim to have told the
whole truth about Johnson, 169 but when Hannah More begged him “to
mitigate some of Johnson’s asperities,” he replied that he “would not
cut off Johnson’s claws, nor make a tiger a cat to please anybody.” 170
Actu - ally he revealed his master’s faults as fully as others h ad
done, but in a large perspective that reduced their prominence. He tried
to show as much of the complete man as affection and decency would
permit. “I am absolutely cer - tain,” he said, “that my mode of
biography, which gives not only a history of J ohnson’s visible progress
through the world, and of his publication, but a view of his mind in his
letters and conversations, is the most perfect that can be conceived,
and will be more of a Life than any work that has ever yet appeared.”
171</p>
<p>At last it came from the press, in two large volumes, in May, 1791.
It was not at once recognized as a unique treasury. Many persons
resented Boswell’s reporting of their private conversation, not always
admirable: Lady Diana Beauclerk was able to read how Johnson had called
her a whore; Reynolds saw where Johnson had reproved him for drinking
too much; Burke learned that Johnson had questioned his political
integrity and had thought him capable of picking up a prostitute;
Mrs. Piozzi and Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu winced. “Dr. Blagden,” wrote
Horace Walpole, “says justly that it is a new kind of libel, by which
you may abuse anybody by saying some dead person said so and so of
somebody alive.” 172 Others found the detail excessive, many letters
trivial, some pages dull. Only gradually did England realize that Bos-
well had achieved a masterpiece, and had given some nobility to his
life.</p>
<p>His father had died in 1782, leaving him Laird of Auchinleck with an
in- come of £ 1 ,600 a year. He proved to be a kindly master, but he was
too accustomed to city life to remain long in Auchinleck. In 1786 he was
ad- mitted to the English bar, and thereafter he spent most of his time
in Lon-</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>don. Reynolds portrayed him in that year — confident and insolent,
with a nose fit to ferret out any secret. At times his wife accompanied
him to London, but usually she lived at Auchinleck. There she died in
1789, aged fifty-one, worn out by the care she had given Boswell and his
children. He survived her by six years — years of deepening degradation.
He tried again and again to overcome his need for liquor, but failed. He
died in London May 19, 1795, aged fifty-six, and his body was taken to
Auchinleck for burial. His sins are at present in the public mind, but
we shall forget them when we read again the greatest of all
biographies.</p>
<p>Looking back over this eighteenth century in English literature, we
per- ceive that it was above all a century of prose, from Addison,
Swift, and De- foe to Sterne, Gibbon, and Johnson, just as the
seventeenth century was an age of poetry, from Hamlet and Donne to
Dryden and Paradise Lost. The rise of science and philosophy, the
decline of religion and mystery, the re- vival of classic unities and
restraints, had chilled the warmth and clogged the flow of imagination
and aspiration; and the triumph of reason was the defeat of poetry, in
France as well as in England. Nevertheless the vitality and versatility
of Eng land’s prose literature in the eighteenth century amply
compensated for the frigid formality prevailing in its verse. Through
Rich- ardson and Fielding the novel, which had been, before them, an
episodic concatenation of picaresque adventures, became a description
and criticism of life, a study of manners, morals, and character, more
illuminating than the records of the historians, who lost the people in
the state. And what liter- ary influence could equal, in that age, the
effect of Richardson on Prevost, Rousseau, Diderot, and Goethe?</p>
<p>If the literature of England in the eighteenth century could not
equal that of the seventeenth, or match the Elizabethan flight, the
total life of England recovered its upward swing after the failure of
national courage and policy in the Restoration. Not since the defeat of
the Armada had England felt such a surge of enterprise and politics; the
years from the rise of Chatham to the death of his son saw the
Industrial Revolution put England far ahead of its rivals in economic
inventiveness and power, and saw the English Parlia- ment conquering
continents while checking its kings. Now the immense British Empire was
built, now the halls of the House of Commons rang with such eloquence as
Europe had not heard since Cicero. Now, while France bankrupted itself
to free America, and decapitated itself to realize its dreams, England
brought all its resources of mind and will to evolve without revolu-
tion, and enter the nineteenth century, in economy and statesmanship,
vic- torious and supreme.</p>
