<p>The Art of the Dispersion</p>
<p>I. A MISCELLANY</p>
<p>T he decline of Greek civilization was longest deferred in the sphere
of art. Here the Hellenistic age bears comparison, not only in fer-</p>
<p>tility but even in originality, with any period in history. Certainly
the minor arts suffered no deterioration. Skilled workers in wood,
ivory, sil- ver, and gold were scattered throughout the expanded Greek
world. The engraving of gems and coins now reached its highest
excellence; as far east as Bactria Hellenized kings lavished art upon
their currency, and in the west the dekadrachma of Hieron II might be
defended as the finest coin in numismatic record. Alexandria became
famous for its goldsmiths and silversmiths, whose artistry rivaled the
faultless style of its poets; for its de- lightful cameos — precious
stones or shells carved in colored relief; for its blue or green
faience, its skillfully glazed pottery, its delicately designed and
many-colored glass. The Portland Vase, very likely a product of</p>
<p>Alexandria, shows this art at its best: elegant figures cut into a
layer of milk-white glass superimposed upon a body of blue glass; this
is, so to speak, the Josiah Wedgwood masterpiece of antiquity.*</p>
<p>Music remained popular in all classes of the population. Scales and
modes changed in the direction of refinement and novelty;’ transient
discords were admitted into harmony; instruments and compositions
increased in com- plexity.” Towards 240, at Alexandria, the old “pipes
of Pan” were en - larged into an organ of bronze pipes; and about 1 7 5
Ctesibius improved this into an organ operated by a combination of water
and air and enabling the player to control vast waves of sound. We know
nothing more of its construction; but we shall see how rapidly it
developed, in Roman days, into the organ of Christian and modem times.’
Instruments were combined into orchestras, and semisymphonic
performances of purely instrumental music, sometimes in five movements,
were given in the theaters of Alex- andria, Athens, and Syracuse.*
Professional virtuosos rose to great prom- inence, and to a social
standing commensurate with their high fees. About</p>

Rome. It is now in the</p>

<p>CHAP.XXVIl) THE ART OF THE DISPERSION 6lJ</p>
<p>318 Aristoxenus of Taras, a pupil of Aristotle, wrote a small
treatise, Har– monies, which became the classic ancient text in musical
theory. Aristox- enus was a very serious man, and like most philosophers
he did not enjoy the music of his time. Athenaeus represents him as
saying, in words that many generations have heard: “We also, since the
theaters have become completely barbarized, and since music has become
utterly ruined and vulgar — we, being but a few, will recall to our
minds, sitting by ourselves, what music used to be.”®</p>
<p>The architecture of the Hellenistic age cannot impress us, for time
has leveled it away with indiscriminate hostility. And yet we know, from
literature and the remains, that the Greek building art spread its sway
in this period from Bactria to Spain. The mutual influence of Greece and
the Orient brought in a mixture of styles: the colonnade and the
architrave invaded inner Asia, while the arch, the vault, and the cupola
entered the West; even so ancient an Hellenic center as Delos raised
Egyptian and Persian capitals. The Doric order seemed too stern and
stiff for an age that loved refinement and ornament; it gave ground city
by city, while the ornate Corinthian style advanced to its highest
excellence. The secularization of art kept pace with the secularization
of government, law, morals, letters, and philosophy; stoas, porticoes,
market places, courts, assembly rooms, libraries, theaters, gymnasiums,
and baths began to crowd out the temples, and regal or private palaces
gave a new outlet to Greek design and decoration. Domestic interiors
were adorned with paintings, statues, and wall reliefs. Private gardens
surrounded the more palatial homes. Royal parks, gar- dens, lakes, and
pavilions were built in the capitals, and were usually opened to public
use. Town planning developed as a sister art to architecture; streets
were laid out on Hippodamus’ rectangular scheme, with main avenues as w
ide as thirty feet — an ample width for horse-and-chariot days. Smyrna
boasted of paved thoroughfares,® but presumably most Hellenistic streets
were trampled dirt, and knew all the vicissitudes of mud.</p>
<p>Fine buildings developed beyond any precedent. At Athens, in the
second century, the lofty Corinthian columns of the Olympieum were set
up, and the general design of the extended edifice, the most magnificent
in Athens, was hid down by the Roman architect Cossutius — a strange
inversion of Rome’s usual dependence upon the artists of Greece. Livy
described this temple of the Olympian Zeus as the only structure he had
seen that could be a fit dwelling for the god of gods.*^ Sixteen columns
of it stand — the most beautiful existing speci- mens of the Corinthian
style. At Eleusis the dying piety of Athens and the genius of Philon
completed the majestic temple of the Mysteries which Pericles had begun
on a site already sacred in Mycenaean times; only fragments are
left.</p>
<p>6i8</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>but some of them show Greek design and carving still at their best.
At Delos the French have excavated the ground plan of Apollo’s
sanctuary, and have re - vealed a city once crowded with edifices
devoted to commerce or the protec- tion of a hundred Greek or foreign
gods. At Syracuse Hieron II raised many impressive buildings, and
restored and enlarged the extant municipal theater; to this day we may
read his name on its stones. In Egypt the Ptolemies adorned Alexandria
with edifices that gave the city a reputation for beauty, but no sign of
them survives. Ptolemy III erected at Edfu a temple which is the noblest
architectural relic of the Grecian occupation, and his successors built
or rebuilt the temple of Isis at Philae. In Ionia new homes were given
to the gods at Mi- letus, Priene, Magnesia, and elsewhere; the third
temple of Artemis at Ephesus was finished about 300 b.c. A still vaster
fane was raised by the architects Paeonius and Daphnis at Didyma, near
Miletus, in honor of Apollo (332 B.C.- A.D. 41); some drums of the
superb Ionic columns still remain. At Pergamum Eumenes II made his
capital the talk of Greece by building, among many noble structures,
that famous Altar to Zeus which the Germans exhumed in 1878, and have
skillfully reconstructed in the Pergamum Museum in Berlin. A majestic
flight of steps mounted between two porticoes to a spacious colonnaded
court; and around one hundred and thirty feet of the base ran a frieze
as supreme in its period as that of the Mausoleum in the fourth century,
or the Parthenon in the fifth. Never had Greece been so handsomely
adorned; and never had the en- thusiasm of its citizens and the skill of
its artists transformed with such splendor so many habitations of
men.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>PAINTING</li>
</ol>
<p>Painting is usually the last great art to mature in a civilization;
in the early stages of a culture it is subordinated to religious
architecture and stat- uary, and it acquires independence only when
private life and private wealth invite the decoration of the home or the
commemoration of a name. The death of democracy having weakened the
sense of the state, the in- dividual returned to domestic consolations.
Rich men built themselves pala- tial residences, and gave high fees to
artists who could adorn a fountain or brighten a wall. Alexandria used
painting on glass as one form of mural ornament; all Hellenistic cities
employed for this purpose movable panels of wood; princes and magnates
preferred to have immense pictures painted on detachable marble slabs.
Pausanias describes a prodigious number of paintings seen by him in his
tour of Greece, but nothing of this flourishing art has cheated time
except some faded tints on pottery or stone. We are left to guess at its
quality from the pale and middling copies found at Pompeii, Herculaneum,
and Rome.</p>
<p>CHAP, XXVIl) THE ART OF THE DISPERSION (S19</p>
<p>Greece continued to rank its painters as high as its sculptors and
archi- tects, perhaps higher. It paid them American commissions, and
told a thou- sand fond stories about their lives, Ctesicles of Ephesus,
failing to receive a desired boon from Queen Stratonice, painted her
romping with a fisher- man, exhibited the picture, and then took ship to
safety; Stratonice, because “the likenesses of the two figures were so
admirably expressed,” forgave him and let him return,® When Aratus took
Sicyon he ordered all portraits of its past dictators destroyed; one
dictator, Archestratus, had been shown by Melanthus (a fourth-century
painter) beside his chariot, and so vividly that the artist Neacles
entreated Aratus to spare the picture; Aratus con- sented, on condition
that the figure of Archestratus be replaced by some less offensive
form,’ Protogenes, says Strabo, painted a satyr with a par- tridge so
realistically that live partridges called to it; the painter finally
blotted out the bird so that people might appreciate the excellence of
his satyr,*’ The same artist, Pliny tells us, applied four coats of
paint to his most famous picture, lalysns (supposed founder of the town
of that name in Rhodes), so that when time wore out the uppermost layer
the colors might still be fresh and clear. Vexed by his inability to
represent with sufficient verisimilitude the foam that dripped from the
mout h of lalysus’ dog, Protogenes lost his temper and hurled a sponge
at the picture, willing to destroy it; the sponge, of course, struck
just at the right place, and, when it fell, left a blotch of color
marvelously like the foam of a panting hound. When Demetrius Poliorcetes
besieged Rhodes he refrained from setting fire to the town lest this
painting be destroyed. During the siege Protogenes continued at work in
his village studio, in the direct line of the Macedonian advance,
Demetrius sent for him and asked why he had not, like the other
villagers, taken refuge within the city walls, “Because I know,”
answered Protogenes, “that you are waging war with the Rhodians, and not
with the arts,” The King assigned a guard to protect him, and neglected
t he siege to watch the artist work,“</p>
<p>Hellenistic painters knew the tricks of perspective, foreshortening,
light- ing, and grouping. Though they used landscapes only as background
and decoration, and rendered them (if we may judge from the Pompeian
cop- ies) in a lifeless and conventional way, they at least realized the
existence of nature, and brought it into art at the same time that
Theocritus was im- porting it into poetry. But they were so interested
in man and all his works that they had little time for trees and
flowers. Their predecessors had painted only the gods and the rich; the
Hellenistic artists were fascinated by anything human, and discovered
that an ugly subject might make a</p>
<p>620 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>beautiful painting, or at least a handsome fee. They turned to common
life v/ith a Dutch zest, and delighted in picturing barbers, cobblers,
prosti- tutes, seamstresses, donkeys, deformed men, or peculiar animals.
To these genre pictures they added representations of still life — cakes
and eggs, fruit and vegetables, fish and game, wine and all the
paraphernalia of its ancient ritual. Sosus of Pergamum amused his
contemporaries by imitating, in a deceptively realistic floor mosaic, an
unswept floor still littered with the leavings of a feast.“ The sedate
were scandalized, and denounced these glorifiers of common things as
pomographoi and rhyparographoi — por^ trayers of obscenity and filth. In
Thebes the representation of ugly objects was forbidden by law.“</p>
<p>Certain larger masterpieces of the age were rescued not from
anonymity but from oblivion by the lava of Vesuvius. A fresco found at
Ostia is apparently a weak copy of a Hellenistic original; we know it as
The Aldobrandini Wedding from the Italian family to which it belonged
before it found a place in the Vatican. Aphrodite, Rubensianly robust,
warms up the courage of the timid bride while the bridegroom, needing no
prodding, waits impatiently beside the couch; finer than these central
personages is a graceful woman playing some hymeneal strain on a faded
lute. A Pompeian mural, traced uncertainly to a third-century Greek
original, shows Achilles, with Patroclus beside him, angrily
surrendering Briseis to Agamemnon’s lust. The figures in these paintings
seem to our wont and taste more ample than beautiful; we are accustomed
to less body and longer legs; but it must be conceded that ancient
artists knew Greek men and women better than we shall ever know them.
Time has taken the bloom from these works; only an act of historical
imagination can restore the brilliance and freshness that doubdess were
once the admiration of multitudes and kings.</p>
<p>More impressive are certain Roman mosaics that have apparently been
de- rived from Hellenistic paintings. Mosaic was an old art in Egypt and
Mesopo- tamia; the Greeks took it over, and lifted it to the peak of its
history. A paint- ing was divided by lines into little squares, and tiny
cubes of marble were so colored that when put together they reproduced
the picture in a form surpris- ingly durable; several mosaics, though
trodden by innumerable feet through many centuries, still retain their
color and tell their ancient tale. The Battle of Isms, found in the
House of the Faun at Pompeii, and dubiously connected with a
fourth-century Greek painting by Philoxenus,* is composed of
approximately 1,500,000 stones, each some two or three millimeters
square, the whole mosaic measuring eight by sixteen feet. It was badly
injured by the earthquake and eruption that overwhelmed Pompeii in a.d.
79, but enough remains to attest the skill and vigor of the work.

<p>filth of war, is leading the attack, and has ridden his Bucephalus to
within a few feet of the chariot that carries Darius. A Persian grandee
has fiung himself be- tween the kings, and has received Alexander’s
lance in his body. Darius, ignor - ing his own danger — for the
conqueror’s next lance is aimed at him— leans from his chariot towards
his fallen friend, his face full of anxiety and grief. Persian
cavalrymen rush up to rescue their ruler, and Alexander’s weapon stays
poised in the air. T he representation of complex emotions in Darius’
face is the out - standing accomplishment of the work; but the most
attractive head in the com- position is that of Alexander’s horse. There
is no greater mosaic than this.</p>
<p>HI. SCXJLPTURE</p>
<p>Never has statuary been more abundant than in the Hellenistic age.
Temples and palaces, homes and streets, gardens and parks were crowded
with it; every phase of human life, and many aspects of the plant and
animal world, were represented in it; portrait busts immortalized for a
moment dead heroes and living celebrities; at last even abstractions
like Fortune, Peace, Calumny, or the Nick of Time, became concrete in
stone. Euty- chides of Sicyon, a pupil of Lysippus, molded for Antioch a
famous Tyche, or Fortime, to serve as the incarnation of the city’s soul
and hope. The sons of Praxiteles — Timachus and Cephisodotus — carried
on the refined tradition of Athenian sculpture; and in the Peloponnesus
Damophon of Messene scaled the heights of fame with a colossal group of
Demeter, Persephone, and Artemis. But most of the new sculptors followed
the line of least starva- tion to the palaces and courts of
Greco-Oriental magnates and kings.</p>
<p>Rhodes, in the third century, developed a school of sculpture
character- istically its own. There were a hundred colossal statues in
the island, any one of which, says Pliny ,“ would have made a city
famous. The greatest of them was the bronze colossus of the sun-god
Helios, set up in successive blocks by Chares of Lindus about 280.
Chares, says a naive tradition, com- mitted suicide when the cost
seriously exceeded his estimate; and Laches, also of Lindus, completed
the work. It did not bestride the harbor, but rose near it to a height
of one hundred and five feet. Its dimensions might sug- gest that
Rhodian taste ran to display and size; but perhaps the Rhodians proposed
to use it as a lighthouse and a symbol. If we may believe a poem in The
Greek Anthology ^ the statue held a light aloft, and symbolized the
freedom that Rhodes enjoyed — a curious anticipation of a famous statue
in a modern port.* It was, of course, included among the Seven Wonders
of the World. “This statue,” Pliny reports,</p>
<p>• The Statue of Liberty is one hundred and fifty -one feet high from
base to torch.</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>was thrown down by an earthquake fifty-six years after it was</p>
<p>erected. Few men can clasp the thumb in their arms, and its
fingers</p>
<p>are larger than most statues. When the limbs are broken asunder vast
caverns are seen yawning in the interior. Within it, too, are to be</p>
<p>seen large masses of rock by whose weight the artist steadied it
while in process of erection. It is said that it was twelve years in the
mak-</p>
<p>ing, and that three hundred talents were spent upon it — a sum raised
from the .engines of war abandoned by Demetrius after his futile</p>
<p>siege.*“</p>
<p>Almost as famous in history was another product of the Rhodian
school, the Laocodn. Pliny saw it in the palace of the Emperor Titus; it
was found in the ruins of the Baths of Titus in a.d. 1506, and is almost
certainly the original work of Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus,
who carved it out of two blocks of marble in the second or first century
b.c.“ Its discovery stirred Renaissance Italy and profoundly impressed
Michelangelo, who tried, without success, to restore the lost right arm
of the central figure, f Laocoon was a Trojan priest who, when the
Greeks sent the wooden horse to Troy, advised against receiving it,
saying (says Virgil), Thneo Danaos et dona ferentes —“l fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts.”” To punish his wisdom Athena, who favored
the Greeks, commissioned two serpents to kill him. They seized first
upon his two sons, seeing which Laocoon rushed to their dd, only to be
caught in the coils; in the end aU three were crushed, and died from the
venom of the fangs. The sculptors took the liberty assumed by Virgil
(and, in the Philoctetes, by Sophocles) to describe pain vigorously, but
the result does not accord with the natural repose of stone. In
literature, and usually in life, pain passes; in the Laocodn the cry of
agony has been given an unnatural permanence, and the specta- tor is not
so moved as by Demeter’s silent grief, f What nevertheless evokes our
admiration is the mastery of design and technique; the musculature is
exaggerated, but the old priest’s limbs, and the bodies of his sons, are
molded with dignity and restraint. Perhaps if we had known the story
before seeing the group we should have been as impressed as Pliny, who
thought this the greatest achievement of ancient plastic art.”</p>

<p>t The restored arm in the Vatican is the work of Bernini, well done
in detail, but ruinous to the centripetal unity of the composition.
Winckelmann nevertheless liked the group so well that Lessing was
aroused, by reading him, to write a book of esthetic criticism around
it, and occasionally about it.</p>
<p>In the Demeter of the British Museum.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVIl) THE ART OF THE DISPERSION 623</p>
<p>Many other Greek centers had flourishing schools of sculpture in this
under- estimated age. Alexandria turned over its soil and its buildings
too often in the long course of its history to preserve the works that
Greek artists made for the Ptolemies. The sole important survivor is the
serene Nile of the Vatican, humor- ously supported by sixteen water
babies symbolizing the sixteen cubits of die rive r’s annual rise. At
Sidon Greek sculpture cut for unknown dignitaries a series of sarcophagi
of which the best, misnamed the Sarcophagus of Alexander, is the pride
of the Constantinople Museum. Its carving is equal, on a smaller scale,
to that of the Parthenon frieze; the figures are handsome and well
propor- tioned; the action is vigorous but clear, and the soft tints
that still cling to the stone exemplify the aid that Greek painting gave
to Greek sculpture. At Tralles, in Caria, about 150 b.c., Apollonius and
Tauriscus cast for Rhodes a colossal bronze group now known as the
Farnese Bull: two handsome youths are lashing the lovely Dirce to the
horns of a wild bull, because she has ill-treated their mother Antiope —
who looks on in repulsively calm satisfaction.* At Pergamum Greek
sculptors cast in bronze several battle groups, which Attalus first
dedi- cated in his capital to celebrate his repulse of the Gauls. To
express the debt which all Greek culture felt to Athens, and perhaps to
spread his fame, Attalus presented marble replicas of these figures to
be set up on the Athenian Acropolis. Fragmentary marble copies have
survived in The Dying Gaul of the Capitoline Museum, in the miscalled
Paetus and Arria^ — ?i Gaul who, preferring death to capture, kills
first his wife and then himself — and in several smaller pieces now
scattered through Egypt and Europe. Perhaps to the same group belongs a
Dead Amazon^ impeccably molded in every detail except the incredibly
per- fect breasts. These figures show a classic restraint in the
expression of emotion; the conquered men suffer the extremes of pain and
grief, but die without opera; and the conquerors have allowed the
artists to portray the virtues, as well as the defeat, of their enemies.
There is no sign here of any falling off in power of conception,
accuracy of anatomical observation, or skill and patience of tech-
nique. Almost as perfect is the great relief that ran along the base of
the Altar of Zeus on the Acropolis of Pergamum, and told again the story
of the war be- tween the gods and the giants — presumably a modest
allegory for Pergamenes and Gauls. The work is overcrowded, and
sometimes theatrically violent; but some figures stand out as in the
best tradition of Greek art. The headless Xeus is carved with the

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>624</p>
<p>(CHAP.XXVn</p>
<p>The age was rich in now anonymous masterpieces that almost call the
roll of the major gods. The majestic Head of T^eus found at Otricoli,
and the Ludovisi Hera now in the Museo delle Terme so pleased the young
Goethe that he took casts of them with him to Germany as, so to speak,
the authentic autographs of Jove and Juno. The once acclaimed Apollo
Belvedere* * * § is academically cold and lifeless; and yet, two
centuries ago, it set Winckelmann aflame.*^ A world away from this
smooth weakling is the Famese Heracles, copied by Glycon of Athens from
an original attributed to Lysippus — all muscle in the overdone body,
all weariness, kindliness, and wonder in the face — as if power was
asking itself its never answered question: what should be its goal? Of
Aphrodite the age had representatives only less numerous than her
devotees; several of these statues have survived, mostly through Roman
copies. The Aphrodite of Melos — rht Venus de Milo of the Louvre — is
apparently an original Greek work of the second century b.c. It was
found on the island of Melos in 1820, near a pedestal fragment bearing
the Itxttts — sandros; perhaps Agesander of Antioch carved this modest
nudity. The face is not as delicately fair as that which forms the
symbol of this volume, but the figure itself is a poem of that health
whose natural flower is beauty; the wasp waist finds no encouragement in
this full body and these sturdy hips. Not so near perfection, but still
pleasant to the eye, are the Capitoline Verms and the Venus de
Medicu Candidly and disarmingly sensual is the Venus Callipyge, or Venus
of the Lovely Buttocks, J who drapes her charms to reveal them, and
turns to admire her nates in the pool. More im- pressive than any of
these is the superb Nike, or Victory of Samothrace, found there in 1863,
and now the sculptural masterpiece of the Louvre.§ The goddess of
victory is shown as if alighting in full flight upon the prow of a
swiftly mov- ing ship and leading the vessel on to attack; her great
wings seem to pull the craft along in the face of the breeze that
confuses her robes. Again the Greek conception of woman as no mere
delicacy, but as a strong mother, dominates the work; this is not the
frail and passing beauty of youth, but the lifelong call of the woman to
the man to lift himself up to achievement, as if the artist had wished
to illustrate the last lines of Goethe’s Faust. The civilization that
could conceive and carve this figure was yet far from dead.</p>
<p>The gods were not the chief interest of the sculptors who brightened
the eve- ning of Greek art. These men looked upon Olympus as a quarry of
subjects, and no more. When that quarry had been worn down by repetition

Salamis in 306; but recent discussion tends to connect it with the batde

<p>to the earth and took delight in representing the wisdom and
loveliness, the strangeness and absurdities of human life. They carved
or cast impressive heads of Homer, Euripides, and Socrates. They made a
number of smooth and deli- cate Hermaphrodites, whose equivocal beauty
arrests the eye in the Archeolog- ical Museum at Constantinople, or the
Borghese Gallery in Rome, or the Louvre. Children offered refreshingly
natural poses, like the boy who removes a thorn from his foot, and
another who struggles with a goose,* and — finest of this class — the
trustful ‘Praying Youth attributed to Lysippus’ pupil Boethus.t Or the
sculp - tors went to the woods and depicted sylvan sprites like the
Barberini Faun of Munich, or hilarious satyrs like the Ihunken Silenus
of the Naples Museum. And here and there, with jolly frequency, they
inserted among their figures the rosy cheeks and impish pranks of the
god of love.</p>

<li>COMMENTARY</li>
</ol>
<p>This sudden irruption of humor into the once formal sanctuaries
of</p>
<p>Greek sculpture is a distinctive mark of Hellenistic art. Every
museum has preserved from the ruins of the age some laughing faun, some
singing Pan, some rioting Bacchus, some urchin serving as a fountain
with alarming indecency. Perhaps the return of Greek art to Asia
restored to it the variety, feeling, and warmth which it had almost lost
in its classic subordi- nation to religion and the state. Nature, which
had been adored, began now to be enjoyed. Not that classic moderation
disappeared: the Youth of Subiaco in the Museo delle Terme, the Sleeping
Ariadne of the Vatican, the Sitting Maiden of the Palace of the
Conservator! continue the delicate tradition of Praxiteles; and in
Athens, throughout this period, many sculp- tors fought the
“modernistic” tendencies of their time by deliberately going back to
fourth- and fifth-century styles, even, now and then, to the archaic
dignity of the sixth. But the spirit of the age was for experiment,
individualism, naturalism, and realism, with a strong countercurrent
toward imagination, idealism, sentiment, and dramatic effect. Artists
carefully followed the progress of anatomy, and worked more from models
in studios; sculptors carved their figures to be seen not only from in
front, but from all sides. They used novel materials — crystal,
chalcedony, topaz, glass, dark basalt, black marble, porphyry — to
imitate the pigment of Negroes or the ruddy faces of satyrs illumined
with wine.</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>were tired of repeating types; they anticipated Ruskin’s criticism,*
and were resolved to show the reality and individuality of the persons
and objects they portrayed. They no longer confined themselves to the
perfect and the beautiful, to athletes, heroes, and gods; they made
genre pictures or terra cottas of workingmen, fishermen, musicians,
market men, jockeys, eunuchs; they sought unhackneyed subjects in
children and peasants, in characterful features like those of Socrates,
in bitter old men like Demos- thenes, in powerful, almost brutal faces
like that of Euthydemus the Greco- Bactrian king, in desolate derelicts
like the Old Market Woman of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; they
recognized and relished the variety and complexity of life. They did not
hesitate to be sensual; they were not parents anxious about the chastity
of their daughters, nor phil- osophers disturbed by the social
consequences of an epicurean individual- ism; they saw the charms of the
flesh, and carved them into a beauty that might for a while laugh at
wrinkles and time. Freed from the conventions of the classic age, they
indulged themselves in tender sentiment, and pic- tured, possibly with
sincere feeling, shepherds dying of undisillusioned love, pretty heads
lost in romantic reverie, mothers fondly contemplating their children:
these, too, seemed to them a part of the reality they would record. And
finally they faced the facts of pain and grief, of tragic catastrophes
and untimely death; and they resolved to find a place for them in their
repre- sentation of human life.</p>
<p>No student with a mind of his own will join in any sweeping judgment
about Hellenistic decay; a general conclusion to this effect serves too
easily as an excuse for ending the story of Greece before the task is
done. We feel in this period a slackening of creative impulse, but we
are compensated by the lavish abundance of an art now completely master
of its tools. Youth cannot last forever, nor are its charms supreme; the
life of Greece, like every life, had to have a natural subsidence, and
accept a ripe old age. De- cadence had set in, it had bitten into
religion, morals, and letters, and had left its stigmata upon individual
works here and there; but the impetus of the Greek genius kept Greek
art, like Greek science and philosophy, near their zenith to the end.
And never in its isolated youth had the Greek passion for beauty, or the
Greek power and patience to embody it, spread so triumphantly, or with
such rich stimulation and result, into the sleeping cities of the East.
There Rome would find it, and pass it on.</p>
<p>• “There is no personal character in Greek art— abstract ideas of
youth and age, strength and swiftness, virtue and vice — yes; but there
is no individuality Ruskin thought only of fifth- and fourth-century
Greek art, just as Winckelmann and Lessing knew chiefly the art of the
HeUenisdc age.</p>
