<h4 id="chapter-xxv">CHAPTER XXV</h4>
<p>The Recovery of Europe</p>
<p>1095-1300</p>
<p>I. BYZANTIUM</p>
<p>A LEXIUS I COMNENUS, after guiding the Eastern Empire success-</p>
<p>l fully through Turkish and Norman wars and the First Crusade, ended
his long reign (1081-1118) amid a characteristically Byzantine intrigue.
His eldest daughter, Anna Comnena, was a paragon of learning, a compen-
dium of philosophy, a poet of parts, a politician of subtlety, an
historian of accomplished mendacity. Betrothed to the son of the Emperor
Michael VII, she felt herself marked for empire by her birth, her
beauty, and her brains; and she could never forgive her brother John for
being born and succeed- ing to the throne. She conspired to assassinate
him, was detected and for- given, retired to a convent, and chronicled
her father’s career in a prose Alexiad. John Comnenus ( 1 118-43)
astonished Europe by a reign of private virtue, administrative
competence, and victorious campaigns against pagan, Moslem, and
Christian foes; for a time it seemed that he would restore the Empire to
its former scope and glory; but a scratch from a poisoned arrow in his
own quiver ended his life and his dream.</p>
<p>His son Manuel I ( 1 143-80) was an incarnate Mars, dedicated to war
and delighting in it, ever in the van of his troops, welcoming single
combat, and winning every battle but the last. Stoic in the field, he
was an epicurean in his palace, luxurious in food and dress, and happy
in the incestuous love of his niece. Under his indulgent patronage
literature and scholarship flour- ished again; the ladies of the court
encouraged authors, and themselves con- descended to write poetry; and
Zonaras now compiled his immense Epitome of History. Manuel built for
himself a new palace, the Blachernae, on the sea- shore at the end of
the Golden Horn; Odom of Deuil tho ught it “the fair - est building in
the world; its pillars and walls were half covered with gold, and
encrusted with jewels that shone even in the obscurity of the night.” 1
Constantinople in the twelfth century rehearsed the Italian
Renaissance.</p>
<p>This splendor of the capital, and the many wars that the aging empire
waged to ward off death, required heavy taxation, which the enjoyers of
luxuries passed on to the producers of necessaries. The peasants grew
poorer, and surrendered to serfdom; the manual workers of the cities
lived in noi- some slums, whose dark filth harbored uncounted crimes.
Vague semicom-</p>

<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 65 1</p>
<p>munistic movements of revolt agitated the proletarian flux, 2 but
have been forgotten in the careless repetitiousness of time. Meanwhile
the capture of Palestine by the Crusaders had opened Syrian ports to
Latin commerce, and Constantinople lost to the rising cities of Italy a
third of its maritime trade. Christian and Moslem alike aspired to
capture this treasury of a millen- nium’s wealth. A good Moslem,
visiting the city in Manuel’s heyday, prayed: “May God in His generosity
and grace deign to make Constantinople the capital of Islam!” 3 And
Venice, daughter of Byzantium, invited the chiv - alry of Europe to join
her in raping the Queen of the Bosporus.</p>
<p>The Latin kingdom of Constantinople, established by the Fourth
Crusade, endured but fifty-seven years (1204-61). Rootless in the race,
faith, or cus- toms of the people — hated by a Greek Church forcibly
subjected to Rome — weakened by its division into feudal principalities
each aping sovereignty- lacking the experience required to organize and
regulate an industrial and commercial economy — attacked by Byzantine
armies without and conspira- cies within — and unable to draw from a
hostile population the revenues needed for military defense, the new
kingdom stood only as long as Byzan- tine revenge lacked unity and
arms.</p>
<p>The conquerors fared best in Greece. Frank, Venetian, and other
Italian nobles hastened to carve the historic land into feudal baronies,
built pictur- esque castles on dominating sites, and ruled with dash and
competence a supine and industrious population. Prelates of the Latin
Church replaced the exiled bishops of the Orthodox faith; and monks from
the West crowned the ancient hills with monasteries that were monuments
and treasuries of medieval art. A proud Frank took the title of duke of
Athens, which Shake- speare, by a venial error of 2000 years, would
un-Baconianly apply to Theseus. But the same martial spirit that had
reared these little kingdoms destroyed them with fraternal strife; rival
factions fought suicidal wars in the hills of the Morea and on the
plains of Boeotia; and when the “Grand Catalan Co mpany” of military
adventurers from Catalonia invaded Greece</p>
<p>Two years after the fall of Constantinople, Theodore Lascaris,
son-in-law of Alexius III, set up a Byzantine government in exile at
Nicaea. All</p>
<p>Anatolia, with the rich cities of Prusa, Philadelphia, Smyrna, and
Ephesus, welcomed his rule; and his just and able administration brought
new pros- perity to these regions, new life to Greek letters, and new
hope to Greek patriots. Farther east, at Trebizond, Alexius Comnenus,
son of Manuel, established another Byzantine kingdom; and a third took
form in Epirus under Michael Angelus . Lascaris’ son -in-law and
successor, John Vatatzes (122 2-54) , added part of Epirus to the
Nicaean kingdom, recaptured Sa- lonika from the Franks (1246), and might
have regained Constantinople</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>652</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>itself had he not been called back to Asia Minor by learning that
Pope Inno- cent IV had invited the advancing Mongols to attack him from
the East (1248). The Mongols rejected the papal plan on the ironical
pretense that they were loath to encourage “the mutual hatred of
Christians.” 4 John’s long reign was one of the most creditable in
history. Despite expensive campaigns to restore Byzantine unity, he
lowered taxes, encouraged agriculture, built schools, libraries,
churches, monasteries, hospitals, and homes for the old or the poor. 5
Literature and art prospered under him, and Nicaea became one of the
richest, fairest cities of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>His son Theodore Lascaris II ( 1 254-8) was an ailing scholar,
learned and bemused; he died after a brief reign, and Michael
Paleologus, leader of the discontented aristocracy, usurped the throne
(1259-82). If we may believe the historians, Michael had every fault —
“selfish, hypocritical … an inborn liar, vain, cruel, and rapacious”; 8
but he was a subtle s trategist and a trium- phant diplomat. By one
battle he made his power in Epirus secure; by an alliance with Genoa he
won ardent aid against the Venetians and the Franks in Constantinople.
He instructed his general Strategopulus to feint an attack upon the
capital from the West; Strategopulus approached the city with only a
thousand men; finding it weakly guarded, he entered and took it with-
out a blow. King Baldwin II fled with his retinue, and the Latin clergy
of the city came after him in righteous panic. Michael, hardly believing
the news, crossed the Bosporus, and was crowned emperor (1261). The By-
zantine Empire, which the world had thought dead, awoke to a post-mortem
life; the Greek Church resumed its independence; and the Byzantine
state, corrupt and competent, stood for two centuries more as a treasury
and vehicle of ancient letters, and a frail but precious bulwark against
Islam.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ARMENIANS: 1060-1300</li>
</ol>
<p>About 1080 many Armenian families, resenting Seljuq domination, left
their country, crossed the Taurus Mountains, and established the kingdom
of Lesser Armenia in Cilicia. While Turks, Kurds, and Mongols ruled Ar-
menia proper, the new state maintained its independence for three
centuries. In a reign of thirty-four years (1185-1219) Leo II repelled
the attacks of the sultans of Aleppo and Damascus, took Isauria, built
his capital at Sis (now in Turkey) , made alliances with the Crusaders,
adopted European laws, en- couraged industry and commerce, gave
privileges to Venetian and Genoese merchants, founded orphanages,
hospitals, and schools, raised his people to unparalleled prosperity,
earned the name of Magnificent, and was altogether one of the wisest and
most beneficent monarchs in medieval history. His son-in-law Hethum I
(1226-70), finding the Christians unreliable, allied himself with the
Mongols, and rejoiced at the expulsion of the Seljuqs from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 653</p>
<p>Armenia ( 1 240) . But the Mongols became converts to Mohammedanism,
warred on Lesser Armenia, and reduced it to ruins (1303L). In 1335 Ar-
menia was conquered by the Mamluks, and the country was divided among
feudal lords. Through all this turbulence the Armenians continued to
show an inventive skill in architecture, a high excellence in miniature
painting, and a resolutely independent form of Catholicism which turned
back all attempts at domination by either Constantinople or Rome.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>RUSSIA AND THE MONGOLS: IO54–I315</li>
</ol>
<p>In the eleventh century southern Russia was held by semibarbarous
tribes — Cumans, Bulgars, Khazars, Polovtsi, Patzinaks. . . . The
remainder of European Russia was divided into sixty-four principalities
— chiefly Kiev, Volhynia, Novgorod, Suzdalia, Smolensk, Ryazan,
Chernigov, and Pereya- slavl. Most of the principalities acknowledged
the suzerainty of Kiev. When Yaroslav, Grand Prince of Kiev, died
(1054), he distributed the principali- ties, according to their
importance, among his sons in order of their senior- ity. The eldest
received Kiev; and by a unique rota system it was arranged that at any
princely death each princely survivor should move up from a lesser to a
greater province. In the thirteenth century several principalities were
further split into “appanages”— regions assigned by the princes to their
sons. In the course of time these appanages became hereditary, and
formed the basis of that modified feudalism which would later share with
the Mon- gol invasion the blame for keeping Russia medieval while
western Europe advanced. In this period, however, the Russian towns had
a busy handicraft industry, and a richer trade than they would have in
many later centuries.</p>
<p>The power of each prince, though usually inherited, was limited by a
popular veche or assembly, and by a senate of nobles ( boyarskaya duma).
Administration and law were mostly left to the clergy; these, with a few
nobles, merchants, and moneylenders, almost monopolized literacy; with
Byzantine texts or models before them, they gave Russia letters and
laws, religion and art. Through their labors the Russkaya Pravda,
Russian Right or Law, first formulated under Yaroslav, received
emendation and definitive codification ( c . 1 160). The Russian Church
was given full jurisdiction over religion and the clergy, marriage,
morals, and wills; and she had unchecked authority over the slaves and
other personnel on her extensive properties. Her efforts moderately
raised the legal status of the slave in Russia, but the traffic in
slaves continued, and reached its height in the twelfth century. 7</p>
<p>That same century saw the decline and fall of the Kievan realm. The
feu- dal anarchy of the West had its rival in the tribal and princely
anarchy of the East. Between 1054 and 1224 there were eighty-three civil
wars in Rus- sia, forty-six invasions of Russia, sixteen wars by Russian
states upon non-</p>
<p>654 the age of faith (chap. XXV</p>
<p>Russian peoples, and 293 princes disputing the throne of sixty-four
princi- palities. 8 In 1 1 1 3 the impoverishment of the Kievan
population by war, high interest charges, exploitation, and unemployment
aroused revolutionary rioting; the infuriated populace attacked and
plundered the homes of the employers and moneylenders, and occupied the
offices of the government for a moment’s mastery. The municipal assembly
invited Prince Monomalch of Pereyaslavl to become Grand Prince of Kiev.
He came reluctantly, and played a role like Solon’s in the Athens of 594
b.c. He lowered the rate of interest on loans, restricted the self-sale
of bankrupt debtors into slavery, limited the authority of employers
over employees, and by these and other measures — denounced as
confiscatory by the rich and as inadequate by the</p>
<p>After his death the strife of princes and classes was resumed.
Meanwhile the continued possession of the lower Dniester, Dnieper, and
Don by alien tribes, and the growth of Italian commerce at
Constantinople, in the Black Sea, and in the ports of Syria, diverted to
Mediterranean channels much of the trade that formerly had passed from
Islam and Byzantium up the rivers of Russia to the Baltic states. The
wealth of Kiev declined, and its martial means or spirit failed. As
early as 1096 its barbarian neighbors began to raid its hinterland and
suburbs, plundering monasteries and selling captured peas- ants as
slaves. Population ebbed from Kiev as a danger spot, and man power
further fell. In 1169 the army of Andrey Bogolyubski sacked Kiev so
thor- oughly, and enslaved so many thousands of its inhabitants, that
for three cen- turies the “mother of Russian cities” almost dropped out
of hist ory. The seizure of Constantinople and its trade by Venetians
and Franks in 1 204, and the Mongol invasions of 1229-40, completed the
ruin of Kiev.</p>
<p>In the second half of the twelfth century the leadership of Russia
passed from the “Little Russians” of the Ukraine to the rougher, hardier
“Great Russians” of the region around Moscow and along the upper
Volga.</p>
<p>Founded in 1156, Moscow was in this age a small village serving
Suzdalia (which ran northeast from Moscow) as a frontier post on the
route from the cities of Vladimir and Suzdal to Kiev. Andrey Bogolyubski
(1157-74) fought to make his principality of Suzdalia supreme over all
Russia; but he died by the hand of an assassin while campaigning to
bring Novgorod, like Kiev, under his sway.</p>
<p>The city of Novgorod was situated in northwestern Russia, on both
sides of the Volkhov, near the exit of that river from Lake Ilmen. As
the Volkhov emptied into Lake Ladoga in the north, and other rivers left
Lake Ilmen to the south and west, and the Baltic, via Lake Ladoga, was
neither too close for safety nor too far for trade, Novgorod developed a
vigorous internal and foreign commerce, and became the eastern pivot of
the Hanseatic</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 655</p>
<p>League. It traded through the Dnieper with Kiev and Byzantium, and
through the Volga with Islam. It almost monopolized the traffic in
Russian furs, for its control reached from Pskov in the west to the
Arctic on the north, and almost to the Urals on the east. After 1196 the
vigorous merchant- aristocrats of Novgorod dominated the assembly that
ruled the principality through its elected prince. The city-state was a
free republic, and called itself “My Lord Novgorod the Great.” If a
prince proved unsatisfactory, the bur - gesses wo uld “make a reverence
and show him the way to leave” town; if he resisted they clapped him
into jail. When Sviatopolk, Grand Prince of Kiev, wished to force his
son upon them as prince (1015), the Novgorodians said, “Send him here if
he has a spare head.” 10 But the republic was not a democ - racy; the
workers and small traders had no voice in the government, and could
influence policy only by repeated revolts.</p>
<p>Novgorod reached its zenith under Prince Alexander Nevsky (1238-63).
Pope Gregory IX, anxious to win Russia from Greek to Latin Christianity,
preached a crusade against Novgorod; a Swedish army appeared on the
Neva; Alexander defeated it near the present Leningrad ( 1 240) , and
won his surname from the river. His victory made him too great for a
republic, and won him exile; but when the Germans took up the crusade,
captured Pskov, and advanced to within seventeen miles of Novgorod, the
frightened assem- bly begged Alexander to return. He came, recaptured
Pskov, and defeated the Livonian Knights on the ice of Lake Peipus
(1242). In his last years he had the humiliation of leading his people
under the Mongol yoke.</p>
<p>For the Mongols entered Russia in overwhelming force. They came from
Turkestan through the Caucasus, crushed a Georgian army there, and pil-
laged the Crimea. The Cumans, who had for centuries warred against Kiev,
begged for Russian aid, saying, “Today they have seized our land,
tomorrow</p>
<p>The Mongols retired to Mongolia, and busied themselves with the con-
quest of China, while the Russian princes resumed their fraternal wars.
In 1237 the Mongols returned under Batu, a great-nephew of Jenghiz Khan;
they were 500,000 strong, and nearly all mounted; they came around the
northern end of the Caspian, put the Volga Bulgars to the sword, and de-
stroyed Bolgar, their capital. Batu sent a message to the Prince of
Ryazan: “If you want peace, give us the tenth of your goods”; he
answered, “When we are dead you may have the whole.” 1 2 Ryazan asked
the principalities for</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>help; they ref used it; it fought bravely, and lost the whole of its
goods. The ir- resistible Mongols sacked and razed all the towns of
Ryazan, swept into Suz- dalia, routed its army, burned Moscow, and
besieged Vladimir. The nobles had themselves tonsured, and hid in the
cathedral as monks; they died when the cathedral and all the city were
given to the flames. Suzdal, Rostov, and a multitude of villages in the
principality were burned to the ground (1238). The Mongols moved on
toward Novgorod; turned back by thick forests and swollen streams, they
ravaged Chernigov and Pereyaslavl, and reached Kiev. They sent envoys
asking for surrender; the Kievans killed the envoys. The Mongols crossed
the Dnieper, overrode a weak resistance, sacked the city, and killed
many thousands; when Giovanni de Piano Carpini saw Kiev six years later,
he described it as a town of 200 cottages, and the surrounding terrain
as dotted with skulls. The Russian upper and middle classes had never
dared to arm the peasants or the city populace; when the Mongols came
the people were helpless to defend themselves, and were massacred or
enslaved at the convenience of the conquerors.</p>
<p>The Mongols advanced into Central Europe, won and lost battles, re-
turned through Russia ravaging, and on a branch of the Volga built a
city, Sarai, as the capital of an independent community known as the
Golden Horde. Thence Batu and his successors kept most of Russia under
domina- tion for 240 years. The Russian princes were allowed to hold
their lands, but on condition of annual tribute — and an occasional
visit of homage over great distances — to the khan of the Horde, or even
to the Great Khan in Mongolian Karakorum. The tribute was collected by
the princes as a head tax that fell with cruel equality upon rich and
poor, and those who could not pay were sold as slaves. The princes
resigned themselves to Mongol mastery, for it pro- tected them from
social revolt. They joined the Mongols in attacking other peoples, even
Russian principalities. Many Russians married Mongols, and certain
features of Mongolian physiognomy and character may have entered the
Russian stock. 13 Some Russians adopted Mongol ways of speech and dress.
Made a dependency of an Asiatic power, Russia was largely severed from
European civilization. The absolutism of the khan united with that of
the Byzantine emperors to beget the “Autocrat of All the Russias” in
later Muscovy.</p>
<p>Recognizing that they could not keep Russia quiet by force alone, the
Mongol chieftains made peace with the Russian Church, protected her pos-
sessions and personnel, exempted them from taxation, and punished
sacrilege with death. Grateful or compelled, the Church recommended
Russian sub- mission to the Mongol masters, and publicly prayed for
their safety. 14 To find security amid alarms, thousands of Russians
became monks; gifts were showered upon religious organizations, and the
Russian Church became im- mensely rich amid the general poverty. A
spirit of submissiveness was de- veloped in the people, and opened a
road to centuries of despotism. Never-</p>

<p>657</p>
<p>theless it was Russia, bending under the Mongol whirlwind, that stood
as a vast moat and trench protecting most of Europe from Asiatic
conquest. All the fury of that human tempest spent itself upon the Slavs
— Russians, Bo- hemians, Moravians, Poles — and the Magyars; Western
Europe trembled, but was hardly touched. Perhaps the rest of Europe
could go forth toward po- litical and mental freedom, toward wealth,
luxury, and art, because for over two centuries Russia remained beaten,
humbled, stagnant, and poor.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE BALKAN FLU</li>
</ol>
<p>XAt an alien distance the Balkans are a mountainous mess of political
instability and intrigue, of picturesque subtlety and commercial craft,
of wars, assassinations, and pogroms. But to the native Bulgar,
Rumanian, Hungarian, or Yugoslav his nation is the product of a thous
and years’ struggle to win independence from encompassing empires, to
maintain a unique and colorful culture, to express the national
character unhindered in architecture, dress, poetry, music, and
song.</p>
<p>For 168 years Bulgaria, once so powerful under Krum and Simeon,
remained subject to Byzantium. In 1186 the discontent of the Bulgar and
Vlach (Walla- chian) population found expression in two brothers, John
and Peter Asen, who possessed that mixture of shrewdness and courage
which the situation and their countrymen required. Summoning the people
of Trnovo to the church of St. Demetrius, they persuaded them that the
saint had left Greek Salonika to make Trnovo his home, and that under
his banner Bulgaria could regain liberty. They succeeded, and amiably
divided the new empire between them, John ruling at Trnovo, Peter at
Preslav. The greatest monarch of their line, and in all Bulgarian
history, was John Asen II (1218-41). He not only absorbed Thrace,
Macedonia, Epirus, and Albania; he governed with such justice that even
his Greek subjects loved him; he pleased the popes with allegiance and
monastic foundations; he supported commerce, literature, and art with
enlightened laws and patronage; he made Trnovo one of the best adorned
cities of Europe, and raised Bulgaria, in civilization and culture, to a
level with most of the nations of his time. His suc- cessors did not
inherit his wisdom; Mongol invasions disordered and weakened the state (
1 292-5), and in the fourteenth century it succumbed first to Serbia and
then to the Turks.</p>
<p>In 1159 the Zhupan (Chieftain) Stephen Nemanya brought the various
Serb clans and districts under one rule, and in effect founded the Serb
kingdom, which his dynasty governed for 200 years. His son Sava served
the nation as archbishop and statesman, and became one of its most
revered saints. The country was still poor, and even the royal palaces
were of wood; it had a flourishing port, Ragusa (now Dubrovnik), but
this was an independent city-state, which in 1221 became a Venetian
protectorate. During these centuries Serbian art, Byzantine in origin,
achieved a style and excellence of its own. In the monastery church of
St. Pante- leimon at Nerez ( c . 1164) the murals reveal a dramatic
realism unusual in Byzan- tine painting, and anticipate by a century
some methods of treatment once thought original to Duccio and Giotto.
Amid these and other Serbian murals of</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>the twelfth or thirteenth century appear royal portraits
individualized beyond any known Byzantine precedent. 15 Medieval Serbia
was moving toward a high civilization when heresy and persecution
destroyed the national unity that might have withstood the Turkish
advance. Bosnia, too, after its medieval zenith under the Ban (King)
Kulin (1180-1204), was weakened by religious disputes; and in 1254 it
fell subject to Hungary.</p>
<p>After the death of Stephen I (1038) Hungary was disturbed by pagan
Magyar revolts against the Catholic kings, and by the efforts of Henry
III to annex Hun- gary to Germany. Andrew I defeated Henry; and when the
Emperor Henry IV renewed the attempt King Geza I frustrated it by giving
Hungary to Pope Gregory VII and receiving it back as a papal fief
(1076). During the twelfth cen- tury rivals for the kingship nurtured
feudalism by large grants of land to nobles in return for support; and
in 1222 the nobility was strong enough to draw from Andrew II a “Golden
Bull” remarkably like the Magna Carta that King John of England had
signed in 1 2 1 5. It denied the heritability of feudal fiefs, but
promised to summon a diet every year, to imprison no noble without a
trial before the “count palatine” (i.e., a count of the imperial
palace), and to levy no taxes upon noble or ecclesiastical estates. This
royal edict, named from its golden case or seal, constituted for seven
centuries a charter of liberty for the Hungarian aris- tocracy, and
enfeebled the Hungarian monarchy precisely at a time when the Mongols
were preparing for Europe one of the greatest crises in its history.</p>
<p>We may judge the extent of the Mongol reach and grasp when we note
that in 12 35 Ogadai, the Great Khan, sent out three armies — against
Korea, China, and Europe. The third army, under Batu, crossed the Volga
in 1237, 300,000 strong- no undisciplined horde but a force rigorously
trained, ably led, and equipped not only with powerful siege engines but
with novel firearms whose use the Mongols had learned from the Chinese.
In three years these warriors laid waste nearly all southern Russia.
Then Batu, as if unable to conceive of defeat, divided them into two
armies: one marched into Poland, took Cracow and Lublin, crossed the
Oder, and defeated the Germans at Liegnitz (1241); the other, under
Batu, sur- tnounted the Carpathians, invaded Hungary, met the united
forces of Hungary and Austria at Mohi, and so overwhelmed them that
medieval chroniclers, never moderate with figures, estimated the
Christian dead at 100,000, and the Emperor Frederick II reckoned the
Hungarian casualties as “almost the whole military force of the
kingdom.” 16 Here, by the inexorable irony of history, defeated and
victors were of one blood; the fallen nobility of Hungary were
descendants of the Mongol Magyars who had ravaged the land three
centuries before. Batu took Pesth and Esztergom (1241), while a body of
Mongols crossed the Danube and pursued the Hungarian King Bela IV to the
Adriatic shore, burning and destroy- ing wildly on the way. Frederick II
vainly called upon Europe to unite against the menace of conquest by
Asia; Innocent IV vainly tried to woo the Mongols to Christianity and
peace. What saved Christianity and Europe was simply the death of
Ogadai, and the return of Batu to Karakorum to participate in the
election of a new khan. Never in history had there been so extensive a
devastation — from the Pacific Ocean to the Adriatic and the Baltic
Seas.</p>

<p>V. THE BORDER STATES</p>
<p>As, in a limitless universe, any point may be taken as center, so, in
the pageant of civilizations and states, each nation, like each soul,
interprets the drama of his- tory or life in terms of its own role and
character. North of the Balkans lay an- other medley of peoples —
Bohemians, Poles, Lithuanians, Livonians, Finns; and each, with
life-giving pride, hung the world upon its own national history.</p>
<p>In the earlier Middle Ages the Finns, distant relatives of the
Magyars and the Huns, dwelt along the upper Volga and Oka. By the eighth
century they had migrated into the hardy, scenic land known to outsiders
as Finland, and to Finns as Suomi, the Land of Marsh. Their raids upon
the Scandinavian coasts induced the Swedish King Eric IX to conquer them
in 1 1 57. At Uppsala Eric left a bishop with them as a germ of
civilization; the Finns killed Bishop Henry, and then made him their
patron saint. With quiet heroism they cleared the forests, drained the
marshes, channeled their “ 10,000 lakes,” 17 gathered furs, and fought
the snow.</p>
<p>South of the Gulf of Finland the same ax- and spadework was
accomplished by tribes akin to the Finns — Borussians (Prussians), Esths
(Estonians), Livs (Livo- nians), Litva (Lithuanians), and Latvians or
Letts. They hunted, fished, kept bees, tilled the soil, and left letters
and arts to the less vigorous posterity for whom they toiled. All but
the Estonians remained pagan till the twelfth century, when the Germans
brought Christianity and civilization to them with fire and sword.
Finding that Christianity was being used by the Germans as a means of
infiltra- tion and domination, the Livonians killed the missionaries,
plunged into the Dvina to wash off the stain of baptism, and returned to
their native gods. Innocent III preached a crusade against them; Bishop
Albert entered the Dvina with twenty- three men-of-war, built Riga as
his capital, and subjected Livonia to German rule (1201). Two
religious-military orders, the Livonian Knights and the Teu- tonic
Knights, completed the conquest of the Baltic states for Germany, carved
out vast holdings for themselves, converted the natives to Christianity,
and re- duced them to serfdom. 18 Heartened by this success, the
Teutonic Knights ad- vanced into Russia, hoping to win at least its
western provinces for Germany and Latin Christianity; but they were
defeated on Lake Peipus (1242) in one of the innumerable decisive
battles of history.</p>
<p>Around these Baltic states surged an ocean of Slavs. One group called
itself Polanie — “people of the fields”— and tilled the valleys of the
Warthe and the Oder; another, the Mazurs, dwelt along the Vist ula; a
third, the Pomorzanie (“by</p>
<p>66o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>the sea”), gave its name to Pomerania. In 963 the Polish prince
Mieszko I, to avoid</p>
<p>Bohemia and Moravia had been settled by Slavs in the fifth and sixth
centuries. In 623 a Slavic chieftain, Samo, freed Bohemia from the
Avars, and established a monarchy that died with him in 658. Charlemagne
invaded the land in 805, and for an unknown period Bohemia and Moravia
were parts of the Carolingian Em- pire. In 894 the Premysl family
brought both lands under their enduring dynasty; but the Magyars ruled
Moravia for half a century (907-57), and in 928 Henry I made Bohemia
subject to Germany. Duke Wenceslas I (928-35) brought pros- perity to
Bohemia despite this intermittent dependency. He had been given a
thoroughly Christian upbringing by his mother, St. Ludmilla; and he did
not cease to be a Christian when he became a ruler. He fed and clothed
the poor, pro- tected orphans and widows, gave hospitality to strangers,
and bought freedom for slaves. His brother tried to assassinate him as
lacking the vices desirable in a king; Wenceslas struck him down with
his own hand, and forgave him; but other members of the conspiracy
murdered the King on his way to Mass on September 25, 935. The day is
annually celebrated as the feast of Wenceslas, Bohemia’s tutelary
saint.</p>
<p>Warlike dukes succeeded him. From their strategic castle and capital
at Prague, Boleslav I (939-67) and II (967-99) and Bratislav I (1037-55)
conquered Mora- via, Silesia, and Poland; but Henry III forced Bratislav
to evacuate Poland and resume the payment of tribute to Germany. Ottokar
I (1 197-12 30) freed Bohe- mia, and became its first king. Ottokar II (
1253-78) subjected Austria, Styria, and Carinthia. Eager to develop
industry and a middle class as counterweights to a rebellious nobility,
Ottokar II encouraged German immigration, until nearly all the towns of
Bohemia and Moravia were predominantly German. 19 The silver mines of
Kutna Hora became the ground of Bohemia’s prosperity, and the goal of
her many invaders. In 1274 Germany declared war against Ottokar; his
nobles refused to support him; he surrendered his conquests, and kept
his throne only as a German fief. But when the Emperor Rudolf of
Hapsburg interfered in the inter- nal affairs of Bohemia, Ottokar raised
a new army and fought the Germans at Diimkrut; again deserted by the
nobles, he plunged into the thickest ranks of the enemy and died in
desperate combat.</p>
<p>THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>66 1</p>
<p>Wenceslas II (1278-1305) won peace by renewed vassalage, and
laboriously restored order and prosperity. With his death the Premyslid
dynasty came to an end after a rule of 500 years. The Bohemians, the
Moravians, and the Poles were the only survivors of the Slav migration
that had once filled eastern Germany to the Elbe; and they were now
subject to the German power.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>GERMANY</li>
</ol>
<p>The victor in the historic contest over lay investiture was the
aristocracy of Germany — the dukes, lords, bishops, and abbots, who,
after the defeat of Henry IV, controlled a weakened monarchy, and
developed a centrifugal feudalism that in the thirteenth century deposed
Germany from the leader- ship of Europe.</p>
<p>Henry V (1106-1125), having overthrown his father, continued his</p>
<p>father’s struggle against barons and popes. When Paschal II refused
to crown him emperor except on surrender of the right to lay
investiture, he impris- oned Pope and cardinals. When he died the
nobility overthrew the principle of hereditary monarchy, ended the
Franconian dynasty, and made Lothair III of Saxony king. Thirteen years
later Conrad III of Swabia began the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the most
powerful line of kings in German history.</p>
<p>Duke Henry of Bavaria rejected the electors’ choice, and was
supported by his uncle Welf, or Guelf; now flared up that strife between
“Guelf” and “Ghibelline” which was to have so many forms and issues in
the tw elfth and thirteenth centuries.* The Hohenstaufen army besieged
the Bavarian rebels in the town and fortress of Weinsberg; there, says
an old tradition, the rival cries “Hi Welf!” and “Hi Weibling!”
established the names of the warring groups; and there (says a pretty
legend), when the victorious Swabians ac- cepted the surrender of the
town on the understanding that the women alone were to be spared, and
were to be allowed to depart with whatever they could carry, the sturdy
housewives marched forth with their husbands on their backs. 20 A truce
was called in 1 142, when Conrad went on crusade; but Conrad failed and
returned in disgrace. The House of Hohenstaufen seemed stamped with
disgrace when its first outstanding figure reached the throne. Friedrich
(“Lord of Peace”) or Frederick I (1152 -90) was thirty when</p>
<p>chosen king. He was not imposing — a small, fair-skinned man with
yellow hair, and a red beard that won him in Italy the name of
Barbarossa. But his head was clear and his will was strong; his life was
spent in labors for the state; and though he suffered many defeats, he
brought Germany again to the leadership of the Christian world. Carrying
in his veins the blood of both the Hohenstaufens and the Welfs, he
proclaimed a Landfried , or Peace</p>
<ul>
<li>“Ghibelline” was a variant of Waiblingen, a village owned by the
Hohenstaufens. This family took its name — “High Staufcn”— from a
mountain castle and village in Swabia.</li>

<p>662</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FATTH</p>
<p>of the Land, conciliated his enemies, quieted his friends, and
sternly sup- pressed feuds, disorder, and crime. His contemporaries
described him as gen- ial, and ever ready with a winning smile; but he
was a “terror to evildoers,” and the barbarism of his penal laws
advanced civilization in Germany. His private life was justly praised
for decency; however, he divorced his first wife on grounds of
consanguinity, and married the heiress of the count of Burgundy, winning
a kingdom with his bride.</p>
<p>Anxious for papal coronation as emperor, he promised Pope Eugenius
III aid against the rebellious Romans and the troublesome Normans in
return for the imperial ointment. Arrived at Nepi, near Rome, the proud
young king met the new pontiff, Hadrian IV, and omitted the customary
rite by which the secular ruler held the pope’s bridle and stirrup and
helped him to dismount. Hadrian reached the ground unaided, and refused
Frederick the “kiss of peace,” and the crown of empire, until the
traditional ritual should be performed. For two days the aides of Pope
and King disputed the point, hanging empire on protocol; Frederick
yielded; the Pope retired and made a second entry on horseback;
Frederick held the papal bridle and stirrup, and thereafter spoke of the
Holy Roman Empire in the hope that the world would consider the emperor,
as well as the pope, the vicegerent of God.</p>
<p>His imperial title made him also King of Lombardy. No German ruler
since Henry IV had taken this title literally; but Frederick now sent to
each of the northern Italian cities a podesta to govern it in his name.
Some cities accepted, some rejected, these alien masters. Loving order
more than liberty, and perhaps anxious to control the Italian outlets of
German trade with the East, Frederick set out in 1 158 to subdue the
rebellious towns, which loved liberty more than order. He summoned to
his court at Roncaglia the learned legists who were reviving Roman law
at Bologna; he was pleased to learn from them that by that law the
emperor held absolute authority over all parts of the Empire, owned all
property in it, and might modify or abrogate pri- vate rights whenever
he thought it desirable for the state. Pope Alexander III, fearing for
the temporal rights of the papacy, and citing the donations of Pepin and
Charlemagne, repudiated these claims, and, when Frederick in- sisted on
them, excommunicated him ( 1 1 60) . The cries of Guelf and Ghibel- line
now passed into Italy to denote respectively the supporters of the Pope
and those of the Emperor. For two years Frederick besieged obdurate
Milan; capturing it at last he burned it to the ground (1162). Angered
by this ruth- lessness, and galled by the exactions of the German
podestas, Verona, Vi- cenza, Padua, Treviso, Ferrara, Mantua, Brescia,
Bergamo, Cremona, Pia- cenza, Parma, Modena, Bologna, and Milan formed
the Lombard League (1167). AtLegnano, in 1176, the troops of the League
defeated Frederick’s German army, and forced him to a six years’ truce.
A year later Emperor and Pope were reconciled; and at Constance
Frederick signed (1183) a treaty restoring self-government to the
Italian cities. These in return recognized</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 663</p>
<p>the formal suzerainty of the Empire and magnanimously agreed to
provision Frederick and his retinue on his visits to Lombardy.</p>
<p>Defeated in Italy, Frederick triumphed everywhere else. He
successfully asserted the imperial authority over Poland, Bohemia, and
Hungary. He re- asserted over the German clergy, in practice if not in
words, all the rights of appointment that Henry IV had claimed, and won
the support of that clergy even against the popes. 21 Germany, glad to
woo him from Italy, basked in the splendor of his power, and gloried in
the knightly pageantry of his coro- nations, his marriages, and his
festivals. In 1 189 the old Emperor led 100,000 men on the Third
Crusade, perhaps hoping to unite East and West in a Roman Empire
restored to its ancient scope. A year later he was drowned in
Cilicia.</p>
<p>Like Charlemagne he had drunk too deeply of the Roman tradition; he
had exhausted himself in the effort to revive a dead past. Admirers of
mon- archy mourned his defeats as victories for chaos; devotees of
democracy cele- brate them as stages in the development of freedom.
Within the limits of his vision he was justified; Germany and Italy were
sinking into a licentious dis- order; only a strong imperial authority
could put an end to feudal feuds and municipal wars; order had to pave
the way before a rational liberty could grow. In the later weakness of
Germany, loving legends formed about Fred- erick I; what the thirteenth
century imagined of his grandson was in time applied to Barbarossa: he
was not really dead, he was only sleeping in the Kyffhauser Mountain in
Thuringia; his long beard could be seen growing through the marble that
covered him; some day he would wake up, shrug the earth from his
shoulders, and make Germany again orderly and strong. When Bismarck
forged a united Germany a proud people saw in him Barba- rossa risen
triumphantly from the tomb. 22</p>
<p>Henry VI (1 190- 7) almost realized his father’s dream. In 1 194,
with the help of Genoa and Pisa, he conquered southern Italy and Sicily
from the Normans; all Italy but the Papal States submitted to him;
Provence, Dau- phine, Burgundy, Alsace, Lorraine, Switzerland, Holland,
Germany, Aus- tria, Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland were united under
Henry’s rule; Eng - land acknowledged itself his vassal; the Almohad
Moors of Africa sent him tribute; Antioch, Cilicia, and Cyprus asked to
be included in the Empire. Henry eyed France and Spain with unsated
appetite, and planned to conquer Byzantium. The first detachments of his
army had already embarked for the East when Henry, aged thirty-three,
succumbed to dysentery in Sicily.</p>
<p>He had made no provision for so ignominious a revenge by the climate
of his conquest. His only son was a lad of three; a decade of disorder
ensued while would-be emperors fought for the throne. When Frederick II
came of age the war of empire and papacy was resumed; it was fought in
Italy by a German-Norman monarch become Italian, and will be better
viewed from the Italian scene. Another generation of turmoil followed
the death of Fred-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>664</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>erick II (1250) — that herrenlose, schreckliche Zeit (Schiller called
it), that “masterless, frightful age” in which the electoral princes
sold the throne of Germany to any weakling who would leave them free to
consolidate their independent power. When the chaos cleared the
Hohenstaufen dynasty had ended; and in 1273 Rudolf of Hapsburg, making
Vienna his capital, began a new line of kings. To win the imperial crown
Rudolf signed in 1279a decla- ration recognizing the complete
subordination of the royal to the papal power, and renouncing all claims
to southern Italy and Sicily. Rudolf never became emperor; but his
courage, devotion, and energy restored order and prosperity to Germany,
and firmly established a dynasty that ruled Austria and Hungary till
1918.</p>
<p>Henry VII (1308-13) made a final effort to unite Germany and
Italy.</p>
<p>With scant support from the nobles of Germany, and a small following
of Walloon knights, he crossed the Alps (1310), and was welcomed by many
Lombard cities tired of class war and interurban strife, and anxious to
throw off the political authority of the Church. Dante hailed the
invader with a treatise On Monarchy boldly proclaiming the freedom of
the secular from the spiritual power, and appealed to Henry to save
Italy from papal domina- tion. But the Florentine Guelfs won the upper
hand, the turbulent cities withdrew their support, and Henry, surrounded
with enemies, died of the malarial fever with which Italy now and then
repays her importunate lovers.</p>
<p>Turned back in the south by natural barriers of topography, race, and
speech, Germany found outlet and recompense in the east. German and
Dutch migration, conquest, and colonization reclaimed three fifths of
Ger- many from the Slavs; fertile Germans expanded along the Danube into
Hun- gary and Rumania; German merchants organized fairs and outlets at
Frank- fort on the Oder, Breslau, Prague, Cracow, Danzig, Riga, Dorpat,
and Reval, and trading centers everywhere from the North Sea and the
Baltic to the Alps and the Black Sea. The conquest was brutal, the
results were an im- mense advance in the economic and cultural life of
the border.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the absorption of the emperors in Italian affairs, the
recurrent need of enlisting or rewarding the support of lords and
knights with grants of land or power, and the weakening of the German
monarchy by papal op- position and Lombard revolts, had left the
nobility free to engross the coun- tryside and reduce the peasantry to
serfdom; and feudalism triumphed in thirteenth-century Germany at the
very time when it was succumbing to the royal power in France. The
bishops, whom the earlier emperors had favored as a foil to the barons,
had become a second nobility, as rich, powerful and independent as the
secular lords. By 1263 seven nobles — the archbishops of Mainz, Trier,
and Cologne, the dukes of Saxony and Bavaria, the count pala- tine, and
the margrave of Brandenburg — had been entrusted by the feudality with
the authority to choose the king; and these electors hedged in the</p>

<p>powers of the ruler, usurped royal prerogatives, and seized crown
lands. They might have acted as a central government and given the
nation unity; they did not; between elections they went their several
ways. No German nation existed yet; there were only Saxons, Swabians,
Bavarians, Franks. . . . There was as yet no national parliament, but
only territorial diets, Landtage; a Reichstag, or Diet of the
Commonwealth, established in 1 247, languished feebly in the
Interregnum, and acquired prominence only in 1 338. A corps of
ministeriales — serfs or freedmen appointed by the king — provided a
loose bureaucracy and continuity of government. No one capital centered
the co.un try’s loyalty and interest; no one system of l aws governed
the realm. Despite the efforts of Barbarossa to impose Roman law upon
all Germany, each region kept its own customs and code. In 1225 the laws
of the Saxons were formulated in the Sachs enspie gel, or Saxon Mirror;
in 1275 the Schwabenspiegel codified the laws and customs of Swabia.
These codes as- serted the ancient right of the people to choose their
king, and of the peasants to keep their freedom and their land; serfdom
and slavery, said the Sachsen- spiegel, are contrary to nature and the
will of God, and owe their origin to force or fraud. 23 But serfdom
grew.</p>
<p>The age of the Hohenstaufens (1138-1254) was the greatest age of Ger-
many before Bismarck. The manners of the people were still crude, their
laws chaotic, their morals half Christian, half pagan, and their
Christianity half a cover for territorial robbery. Their wealth and
comforts could not compare, city for city, with those of Flanders or
Italy. But their peasantry was industrious and fertile, their merchants
enterprising and adventurous, their aristocracy the most cultured and
powerful in Europe, their kings the secular heads of the Western world,
ruling a realm from the Rhine to the Vistula, from the Rhone to the
Balkans, from the Baltic to the Danube, from the North Sea to Sicily.
Out of a virile commercial life a hundred cities had taken form; many of
them had charters of self-government; decade by dec- ade they grew in
wealth and art, until in the Renaissance they would be the pride and
glory of Germany, and be mourned in our day as a beauty that has passed
from the earth.</p>

<li>SCANDINAVIA</li>
</ol>
<p>After a century of happy obscurity Denmark re-entered world history
with Waldemar I (1157-82). Helped by his minister Absalon, Archbishop of
Lund, he organized a strong government, cleared his seas of pirates, and
enriched Denmark by protecting and encouraging trade. In 1167 Absalon
founded Copenhagen as a “market haven”— Kjoebenhavn. Waldemar II
(1202-41) replied to German aggression by conquering Holstein, Ham-
burg, and Germany northeast of the Elbe. “For the honor of the Blessed
Vir - gin” he undertook three “crusades” against the Baltic Slavs,
captured north -</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>em Estonia, and founded Reval. In one of these campaigns he was
attacked in his camp, and escaped death, we are told, partly by his own
valor, partly through the timely descent, from heaven, of a red banner
bearing a white cross; this Dannebrog, or Dane’s Cloth, became
thereafter the battle standard of the Danes. In 1223 he was taken
prisoner by Count Henry of Schwerin, and was released, after two and a
half years, only on his surrendering to the Germans all his Germanic and
Slav conquests except Rugen. He devoted the remainder of his remarkable
life to internal reforms and the codification of Danish law. At his
death Denmark was double its present area, included southern Sweden, and
had a population equal to that of Sweden (300,000) and Norway (200,000)
combined. The power of the kings declined after Waldemar II, and in 1282
the nobles secured from Eric Glipping a charter recognizing their
assembly, the Danehof, as a national parliament.</p>
<p>Only the imaginative empathy of a great novelist could make us
visualize the achievement of Scandinavia in these early centuries — the
heroic conquest, day by day, foot by foot, of a difficult and dangerous
peninsula. Life was still primitive; hunting and fishing, as well as
agriculture, were primary sources of sustenance; vast forests had to be
cleared, wild animals had to be brought under control, waters had to be
channeled to productive courses, harbors had to be built, men had to
harden themselves to cope with a nature that seemed to resent the
intrusion of man. Cistercian monks played a noble role in this agelong
war, cutting timber, tilling the soil, and teaching the peasants
improved methods of agriculture. One of the many heroes of the war was
Earl Birger, who served Sweden as prime minister from 1 248 to 1 266,
abol- ished serfdom, established the reign of law, founded Stockholm
(c. 1255), and inaugurated the Folkung dynasty ( 1 250-1 365) by putting
his son Wal- demar on the throne. Bergen grew rich as the outlet of
Norway’s trade, and Visby, on the island of Gotland, became the center
of contact between Swe- den and the Hanseatic League. Excellent churches
were built, cathedral and monastic schools multiplied, poets strummed
their lays; and Iceland, far off in the Arctic mists, became in the
thirteenth century the most active literary center in the Scandinavian
world.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror ruled England with a masterly mixture of force,
legality, piety, subtlety, and fraud. Elevated to the throne by a cowed
Witan, he swore to observe existing English law. Some thanes in the west
and north took advantage of his absence in Normandy to try revolt
(1067); he re-</p>
<p>turned, and passed like a flame of revenge through the land, and
“harried the north” with such judicious killing and destruction of
homes, barns, crops,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 667</p>
<p>and cattle that northern England did not fully recover till the
nineteenth century. 24 He distributed the choicest lands of the kingdom
in great estates among his Norman aides, and encouraged these to build
castles as fortresses of defense against a hostile population.* He kept
large tracts as crown lands; one parcel, thirty miles long, was set
aside as a royal hunting preserve; all houses, churches, and schools
therein were leveled to the ground to clear the way for horses and
hounds; and any man who slew a hart or hind in this New Forest was to
lose his eyes. 25</p>
<p>So was founded the new nobility of England, whose progeny still bear,
now and then, French names; and the feudalism that before had been rela-
tively weak covered the land, and reduced most of the conquered people
to serfdom. All the soil belonged to the king; but Englishmen who could
show that they had not resisted the Conquest were allowed to repurchase
their lands from the state. To list and know his spoils, William sent
agents in 1085 to record the ownership, condition, and contents of every
parcel of land in England; and “so narrowly did he commission them,”
says the old Chronicle, “that there was not a yard of land, nay . . .
not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine, that was not set down in his
writ.” 26 The result was the Domesday Book, ominously so named as the
final “doom” or judgment in all disputes of realty. To assure himself
military support, and limit the power of his great vassals, William
summoned all important landowners of England — 60,000 of them — to a
concourse at Salisbury (1086), and made every man pledge his paramount
fealty to the king. It was a wise precaution against the individual-
istic feudalism that was at that time dismembering France.</p>
<p>One must expect a strong government after a conquest. William set up
or deposed knights and earls, bishops and archbishops and abbots; he did
not hesitate to jail great lords, and to assert his right over
ecclesiastical appoint- ments against the same powerful Gregory VII who
was in these years bring- ing the Emperor Henry IV to Canossa. To
prevent fires lie ordered a curfew — i.e., a covering or extinction of
hearth fires, and therefore in winter retire- ment to bed — by eight
p.m. for the people of England. 27 To finance his spreading government
and conquests he laid heavy taxes upon all sales, im- ports, exports,
and the use of bridges and roads; he restored the Danegeld, which Edward
the Confessor had abolished; and when he learned that some Englishmen,
to elude his fingers, had placed their money in monastic vaults, he had
all monasteries searched and all such hoards removed to his own treas-
ury. His royal court readily accepted bribes, and honestly recorded them
in the public register. 28 It was frankly a government of conquerors
resolved that the profits of their enterprise should be commensurate
with its risks.</p>

<p>668</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>The Norman clergy shared in the victory. The able and pliant Lanfranc
was brought in from Caen and was made Archbishop of Canterbury and first
minister to the King. He found the Anglo-Saxon clergy addicted to
hunting, dicing, and marriage, 29 and replaced them with Norman priests,
bishops, and abbots; he drew up a new monastic constitution, the Customs
of Canterbury, and raised the mental and moral level of the English
clergy. Probably at his suggestion William decreed the separation of
ecclesiastical from secular courts, ordered all spiritual matters to be
submitted to the canon law of the Church, and pledged the state to
enforce the penalties fixed by ecclesiastical tribunals. Tithes were
levied upon the people for the support of the Church. But William
required that no papal bull or letter should be given currency or force
in England without his approval, and that no papal legate should enter
England without the royal consent. The national assembly of the bishops
of England, which had been part of the Witan, was hereafter to be a
distinct body, and its decrees were to have no validity except when
confirmed by the King. 30</p>
<p>Like most great men, William found it easier to rule a kingdom than
his family. The last eleven years of his life were clouded by quarrels
with his Queen Matilda. His son Robert demanded full authority in
Normandy; de- nied this, he rebelled; William fought him indecisively,
and made peace by promising to bequeath the duchy to Robert. The King
grew so stout that he could hardly mount a horse. He warred with Philip
I of France over</p>
<p>boundaries; when he tarried at Rouen, almost immovable with
corpulence, Philip jested (it was said) that the King of England was
“lying in,” and there would be a grand display of candles at his
churching. William swore that he would indeed light many candles. He
ordered his army to burn down Mantes and all its neighborhood, and to
destroy all crops and fruits; and it was done. Riding happily amid the
ruins, William was thrown against the iron pommel of his saddle by a
stumble of his horse. He was carried to the priory of St. Gervase near
Rouen. He confessed his sins in gross, and made his will; distributed
his treasure penitently among the poor and to the Church, and provided
for the rebuilding of Mantes. All his sons except Henry deserted his
deathbed to fight for the succession; his officers and serv- ants fled
with what spoils they could take. A rustic vassal bore his remains to
the Abbaye aux Hommes at Caen (1087). The coffin made for him proved too
small for his corpse; when the attendants tried to force the enormous
bulk into the narrow space the body burst, and filled the church with a
royal stench. 31</p>
<p>The results of the Norman Conquest were limitless. A new people and
class were imposed upon the Danes who had displaced the Anglo-Saxons who
had conquered the Roman Britons who had mastered the Celts . . .; and
centuries would elapse before the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic elements
would</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 669</p>
<p>reassert themselves in British blood and speech. The Normans were
akin to the Danes, but in the century since Rollo they had become
Frenchmen; and with their coming the customs and speech of official
England became for three centuries French. Feudalism was imported from
France into England with its trappings, chivalry, heraldry, and
vocabulary. Serfdom was more deeply and mercilessly imposed than ever in
England before. 32 The Jewish moneylenders who came in with William gave
a new stimulus to English trade and industry. The closer connection with
the Continent brought to England many ideas in literature and art;
Norman architecture achieved its greatest triumphs in Britain. The new
nobility brought new manners, fresh vitality, a better organization of
agriculture; and the Norman lords and bishops improved the
administration of the state. The government was cen- tralized. Though it
was through despotism, the country was unified; life and property were
made more secure, and England entered upon a long period of internal
peace. She was never successfully invaded again.</p>
<p>2 . Thomas a Becket</p>
<p>It is an adage in England that between two strong kings a weak king
inter- venes; but there is no limit to the number of intermediate
middlings. After the Conqueror’s death his eldest son Robert received
Normandy as a separate</p>
<p>crowned King of England on promising good behavior to his anointer
and minister Lanfranc. He ruled as a tyrant till 1093, fell sick,
promised good be- havior, recovered, and ruled as a tyrant till he was
shot to death, while hunt- ing, by an unknown hand. The saintly Anselm,
who succeeded Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury, withstood him
patiently, and was sent back to France.</p>
<p>A third son of the Conqueror, Henry I (1100-35), recalled Anselm. The
prelate-philosopher demanded an end to the royal election of bishops;
Henry refused; after a tedious quarrel it was agreed that English
bishops and abbots were to be chosen by cathedral chapters or the monks
in the presence of the king, and should do homage to him for their
feudal possessions and powers. Henry loved money and hated waste; he
taxed heavily but governed provi- dently and justly; he kept England in
order and at peace, except that with one battle — at Tinchebrai in 1106
— he restored Normandy to the British crown. He bade the nobles
“restrain themselves in dealing with the wives, sons, and daughters of
their men”; 33 he himself had many illegitimate sons and daughters by
various mistresses, 34 but he had the grace and wisdom to marry Maud,
scion of both the Scottish and pre-Norman English kings, thereby
bringing old royal blood into the new royal line.</p>
<p>In his last days Henry made the barons and bishops swear fealty to
his</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>daughter Matilda and her young son, the future Henry II. But on the
King’s death Stephen of Blois, grandson of the Conqueror, seized the
throne, and England suffered fourteen years of death and taxes in a
civil war marked by the most horrible cruelties. 35 Meanwhile Henry II
grew up, married Eleanor of Aquitaine and her duchy, invaded England,
forced Stephen to recognize him as heir to the throne, and, on Stephen’s
death, became king ( 1 1 54) ; so ended the Norman, and began the
Plantagenet, dynasty.* Henry was a man of strong temper, eager ambition,
and proud intellect, half inclined to athe- ism. 36 Nominally master of
a realm that reached from Scotland to the Pyre- nees, including half of
France, he found himself apparently helpless in a feudal society where
the great lords, armed with mercenaries and fortified in castles, had
pulverized the state into baronies. With awesome energy the youthful
king gathered money and men, fought and subdued one lord after another,
destroyed the feudal castles, and established order, security, justice,
and peace. With a masterly economy of cost and force he brought under
English rule an Ireland conquered and despoiled by Welsh buccaneers. But
this strong man, one of the greatest kings in England’s history, was
shattered and humbled by encountering in Thomas a Becket a will as
inflexible as his own, and in religion a power then mightier than any
state.</p>
<p>Thomas was born in London about 1118, of middle-class Norman par-
entage. His precocious brilliance of mind caught the eye of Theobald,
Arch- bishop of Canterbury, who sent him to Bologna and Auxerre to study
civil and canon law. Returning to England he entered orders, and soon
rose to be Archdeacon of Canterbury. But, like so many churchmen of
those centuries, he was a man of affairs rather than a clergyman; his
interest and skill lay in administration and diplomacy; and he showed
such ability in these fields that at the age of thirty-seven he was made
secretary of state. For a time he and Henry accorded well; the handsome
chancellor shared the intimacy and knightly sports, almost the wealth
and power, of the King. His table was the most sumptuous in England; and
his charity to the poor was equaled by his hospitality to his friends.
In war he led in person 700 knights, fought single combats, planned
campaigns. When he was sent on a mission to Paris his luxurious equipage
of eight chariots, forty horses, and 200 attendants alarmed the French,
who wondered how rich must be the king of so opulent a minister.</p>
<p>In 1 1 62 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. As if by some
magic incantation, he now changed his ways abruptly and thoroughly. He
gave up his stately palace, his royal raiment, his noble friends. He
sent in his resigna- tion as chancellor. He put on coarse garb, wore a
haircloth next to his skin, lived on vegetables, grains, and water, and
every night washed the feet of thirteen beggars. He became now an
unyielding defender of all the rights,</p>
<ul>
<li>Geoffrey of Anjou, father of Henry II, had worn a sprig ( plctnta )
of the broom plant (Fr. genet) in his hat.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 6j I</p>
<p>privileges, and temporalities of the Church. Among these rights was
the ex- emption of the clergy from trial by civil courts. Henry, who
aspired to spread his rule over all classes, raged to find that crimes
by the clergy often went unpunished by ecclesiastical courts.
Assemblying the knights and bishops of England at Clarendon ( 1 1 64) ,
he persuaded them to sign the Con- stitutions of Clarendon, which ended
many clerical immunities; but Becket refused to put his archiepiscopal
seal upon the documents. Henry promul- gated the new laws nevertheless,
and summoned the ailing prelate to trial at the royal court. Becket
came, and quietly withstood his own bishops, who joined in declaring him
guilty of feudal disobedience to his suzerain the King. The court
ordered his arrest; he announced that he would appeal the case to the
Pope; and in his archiepiscopal robes, which none dared touch, he walked
unharmed from the room. That evening he fed a great number of the poor
in his London home. During the night he fled in disguise, by devious
routes, to the Channel; crossed the turbulent strait in a frail vessel,
and found haven in a monastery at St. Omer in the realm of the king of
France. He submitted his resignation as archbishop to Pope Alexander
III, who defended his stand, reinvested him with his see, but sent him
for a time to live as a simple Cister- cian monk in the abbey of
Pontigny.</p>
<p>Henry banished from England all of Becket’s relatives, of any age or
sex. When Henry came to Normandy Thomas left his cell, and from a pulpit
at Vezelay pronounced excommunication upon those English clergymen who
upheld the Constitutions of Clarendon (1166). Henry threatened to con-
fiscate the property of all priories, in England, Normandy, Anjou, and
Aqui- taine, affiliated with the abbey of Pontigny if its abbot
continued to harbor Becket; the frightened abbot begged Thomas to leave,
and the ailing rebel lived for a time on alms in a dingy inn at Sens.
Alexander III, prodded by Louis VII of France, commanded Henry to
restore the Archbishop to his see or face an interdict of all religious
services in the territories under English rule. Henry yielded. He came
to Avranches, met Becket, promised to remedy all his complaints, and
held the Archbi shop’s stirrup as the triumphant prel - ate mounted to
return to England (1169). Back in Canterbury, Thomas re- peated his
excommunication of the bishops who had opposed him. Some of these went
to Henry in Normandy and roused him to fury with perhaps ex- aggerated
accounts of Becket’s behavior. “What!” exclaimed Henry, “shall a man who
has eaten my bread . . . insult the King and all the kingdom, and not
one of the lazy servants whom I nourish at my table does me right for
such an affront?” Four knigh ts who heard him went to England,
apparently without the knowledge of the King. On December 30, 1170, they
found the Archbishop at the altar of the cathedral in Canterbury; and
there they cut him down with their swords.</p>
<p>All Christendom rose in horror against Henry, branding him with a
spon- taneous and universal excommunication. After secluding himself in
his cham-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>6 71</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>bers and refusing food for three days, the King issued orders for the
appre- hension of the assassins, sent emissaries to the Pope to declare
his innocence, and promised to perform any penance that Alexander might
require. He re- scinded the Constitutions of Clarendon, and restored all
the previous rights and property of the Church in his realm. Meanwhile
the people canonized Becket, and proclaimed that many miracles were
worked at his tomb; the Church officially pronounced him a saint (1172);
and soon thousands were making pilgrimage to his shrine. Finally Henry,
too, came to Canterbury as a penitent pilgrim; all the last three miles
he walked with bare and bleeding feet on the flinty road; he prostrated
himself before the tomb of his dead foe, begged the monks to scourge
him, and submitted to their blows. His strong will broke under the
weight of general obloquy and mounting troubles in his realm. His wife
Eleanor, banished and imprisoned by the adulterous King, plotted with
her sons to depose him. His eldest son Henry led feudal rebel- lions
against him in 1 173 and 1183, and died in revolt. In 1 189 his sons
Rich- ard and John, impatiently awaiting his death, allied themselves
with Philip Augustus of France in war upon their father. Driven from Le
Mans, he de- nounced the God who had taken from him this town of his
birth and love; and dying at Chinon ( 1 1 89) , he cursed with his last
breath the sons who had betrayed him, and the life that had given him
power and glory, riches and mistresses, enemies, contumely, treacheries,
and defeat.</p>
<p>He had not quite failed. He had surrendered to Becket dead what he
had refused to Becket living; yet in that bitter dispute it was Henry’s
contention that won the accolade of time: from reign to reign, after
him, the secular courts spread their jurisdiction over clerical, as well
as lay, subjects of the king. 37 He liberated English law from feudal
and ecclesiastical limitations, and set it upon the path of development
that has made it one of the supreme legal achievements since imperial
Rome. Like his great-grandfather the Con- queror he strengthened and
unified the government of England by reducing to discipline and order a
rebellious and anarchic nobility. There he succeeded too well: the
central government became strong to the verge of irresponsible and
incalculable despotism; and the next round in the historic alternation
between order and liberty belonged to the aristocracy and freedom.</p>
<p>3 . Magna Carta</p>
<p>Richard I the Lion- Hearted succeeded without challenge to his
father’s throne. Son of the adventurous, impulsive, irrepressible
Eleanor, he followed in her steps rather than in those of the somber and
competent Henry. Bom in Oxford in 1 157, he was delegated by his mother
to administer her domin- ions in Aquitaine. There he imbibed the
skeptical culture of Provence, the “gay science” of the troubadours, and
was never afterward an Englishman.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 673</p>
<p>He loved adventure and song more than politics and administration; he
crowded a century of romance into his forty-two years, and gave to the
poets of his time the compliment of imitation as well as the
encouragement of patronage. The first five months of his reign were
spent in gathering funds for a crusade; he appropriated for the purpose
the full treasury left by Henry II; he removed thousands of officials,
and reappointed them for a considera- tion; he sold charters of freedom
to cities that could pay, and acknowledged Scotland’s independence for 1
5,000 marks— not that he loved money less, but adventure more. Within
half a year of his accession he was off to Palestine. He cared as little
for his own safety as for others’ rights; he taxed his realm to the
utmost, and squandered revenue in luxury, feasting, and display; but he
galloped through the final decade of the twelfth century with such bra-
vado and bravery that his fellow poets ranked him above Alexander,
Arthur, and Charlemagne.</p>
<p>He fought and loved Saladin, failed and swore to conquer him, turned
homeward, and was captured on the way (1192) by Duke Leopold of Aus-
tria, whom he had offended in Asia. Early in 1193 Leopold surrendered
him to the Emperor Henry VI, who held a grudge against Henry II and
Richard; despite the law, generally recognized in Europe, against the
detention of a Crusader, Henry VI kept the King of England prisoner in a
castle at Diirn- stein on the Danube, and demanded for him from England
a ransom of 150,000 marks (5,000,000) — double the whole annual revenue
of the Brit- ish crown. In the meantime Richard’s brother John tried to
seize the th rone; resisted, he fled to France, and joined Philip
Augustus in attacking England. Philip, violating a pledge of peace,
attacked and seized English possessions in France, and offered great
bribes to Henry VI to keep Richard prisoner. Richard fretted in
comfortable durance, and wrote an excellent ballad 38 appealing to his
country for ransom. Through this turmoil Eleanor governed successfully
as regent, with the wise counsel of her justiciar Hubert Walter,
Archbishop of Canterbury; but they found it hard to raise the ransom.
Finally released (1194), Richard hurried to England, levied taxes and
troops, and led an army across the Channel to avenge himself and Britain
against Philip. Tradition holds that he refused the sacraments for years
lest he be required to forgive his faithless enemy. He recovered all the
territory that Philip had captured, and resigned himself to a peace that
allowed Philip to live. In the interlude he quarreled with a vassal,
Adhemar, Viscount of Limoges, who had found a cache of gold on his land.
Adhemar offered Richard a part, Rich- ard demanded all, and besieged
him. An arrow from Adhemar’s castle struck the King, and Richard Coeur
de Lion died in his forty-third year in a dispute over a mess of
gold.</p>
<p>His brother John ( 1 199-1 216)* succeeded him after some opposition
and</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicknamed Lackland because, unlike his elder brothers, he had not
received from his father any appanage on the Continent.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>674</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>distrust; and Archbishop Walter made him swear a coronation oath that
his throne was held by the election of the nation (i.e., the nobles and
prelates) and the grace of God. But John, having been false to his
father, his brother, and his wife, was not sorely hampered by one more
vow. Like Henry II and Richard I he gave little evidence of religious
belief. It was said that he had never taken the Eucharist since coming
of age, not even on his coronation day. 39 The monks charged him with
atheism, and told how, having caught a f at stag, he had remarked: “How
plump and well fed is this animal! and yet, I dare swear, he never heard
Mass”— which the monks resented as an allusion to their corpulence. 40
He was a man of much intellect and little scruple; an excellent
administrator; “no great friend to the clergy,” and therefore, said
Holinshed, a bit maligned by monastic chroniclers; 41 not always in the
wrong, but often alienating men by his sharp temper and wit, his
scandalous humor, his proud absolutism, and the tax exactions to which
he felt driven in defending Continental England against Philip
Augustus.</p>
<p>In 1199 John secured permission from Pope Innocent III to divorce
Isabel of Gloucester on grounds of consanguinity, and soon thereafter he
married Isabella of Angouleme, despite her betrothal to the count of
Lusignan. The nobility of both countries took offense, and the count
appealed to Philip for redress. About the same time the barons of Anjou,
Touraine, Poitou, and Maine protested to Philip that John was oppressing
their provinces. By feudal fealties going back to the cession of
Normandy to Rollo, the territorial lords of France, even in provinces
owned by England, acknowledged the French king as their feudal suzerain;
and by feudal law John, as Duke of Normandy, was vassal to the king of
France. Philip summoned his royal vassal to come to Paris and defend
himself against divers charges and appeals. John refused. The French
feudal court declared his possessions in France forfeited, and awarded
Normandy, Anjou, and Poitou to Arthur, Count of Brittany, a grandson of
Henry II. Arthur laid claim to the throne of England, raised an army,
and besieged at Mirabeau Queen Eleanor, who, though eighty, led a force
in defense of her unruly son. John rescued her, captured Arthur, and
apparently ordered his death. Philip invaded Normandy. John was too busy
honeymooning at Rouen to lead his troops; they were defeated; John fled
to England; and Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine passed to the
French crown.</p>
<p>Pope Innocent III, at odds with Philip, had done what he could to
help John; John now quarreled with Innocent. On the death of Hubert
Walter ( 1 205) the King persuaded the older monks of Canterbury to
elect John de Gray, Bishop of Norwich, to the vacant see. A group of
younger monks chose Reginald, their subprior, as archbishop. The rival
candidates hurried to Rome, seeking papal confirmation; Innocent
rejected them both, and ap- pointed to the see Stephen Langton, an
English prelate who for the past twenty-five years had lived in Paris,
and was now a professor of theology in</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 675</p>
<p>the university there. John protested that Langton had no preparation
for the office of primate of England, a position involving political as
well as ecclesias- tical functions. Ignoring John’s demurrers, Innocent,
at Viterbo in Italy, consecrated Stephen archbishop of Canterbury
(1207). John defied Langton to set foot on English soil; threatened to
burn the cloisters over the heads of the r ebellious Canterbury monks;
and swore “by the teeth of God” that if the Pope laid an interdict on
England he would banish every Catholic clergyman from the land, and
would put out the eyes and cut off the nose of some of them for good
measure. The interdict was pronounced ( 1 208) ; all religious services
of the clergy in England were suspended except baptism and extreme
unction; churches were closed by the clergy, church bells were silenced,
and the dead were buried in unconsecrated ground. John confiscated all
episcopal or monastic properties, and gave them to laymen. Innocent ex-
communicated the King; John ignored the decree, and waged successful
campaigns in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The people trembled under the
interdict, but the nobles acquiesced in the spoliation of Church
property as transiently diverting the royal appetite from their own
wealth.</p>
<p>Proud of his apparent victory, John offended many by his excesses. He
neglected his second wife to beget illegitimate children upon careless
mis- tresses; jailed Jews to milk their money from them; allowed some
imprisoned prelates to die of hardships; alienated nobles by adding
insults to taxes; and strictly enforced the unpopular forestry laws. In
1213 Innocent used his last resort: he promulgated a decree of
deposition against the English King, re- leased John’s subjects from
their oath of allegiance, and declared the King’s possessions to be now
the lawful spoil of whoever could wrest them from his sacrilegious
hands. Philip Augustus accepted the invitation, assembled an im-
pressive army, and marched to the Channel coast. John prepared to resist
invasion; but now he discovered that the nobles would not support him in
a war against a Pope armed with physical as well as spiritual force.
Furious against them, and seeing the imminence of defeat, he struck a
bargain with Pandulf, the papal legate: if Innocent would withdraw his
decrees of excom- munication, interdict, and deposition, and would
change from foe to friend, John pledged himself to return all
confiscated ecclesiastical property, and to submit his crown and his
kingdom to the Pope in feudal vassalage. It was so agreed; John
surrendered all England to the Pope, and received it back, after five
days, as a papal fief subject to perpetual tribute and fealty
(1213).</p>
<p>John embarked for Poitou to attack Philip, and commanded the barons
of England to follow him with arms and men. They refused. The victory of
Philip at Bouvines deprived John of German and other allies to whom he
had looked for aid against an expanding France. He returned to England
to face an embittered aristocracy. The nobles resented his inordinate
taxation for disastrous wars, his violations of precedent and law, his
bartering of England for Innocent’s forgiveness and support. To force
the issue, John required of</p>
<p>6j 6 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>them a scutage — a money payment in lieu of military service. They
sent him instead a deputation demanding a return to the laws of Henry I,
which had protected the rights of the nobles and limited the powers of
the king. Receiv- ing no satisfactory answer, the nobles collected their
armed forces at Stam- ford; and while John dallied at Oxford they sent
emissaries to London, who won the support of the commune and the court.
At Runnymede on the Thames, near Windsor, the forces of the aristocracy
encamped opposite the few supporters of the King. There John made his
second great surrender, and signed (1215) Magna Carta, the most famous
document in English history.</p>

<p>The Great Charter deserves its fame as the foundation of the
liberties today enjoyed by the English-speaking world. It was indeed
limited; it defined the rights of the nobles and the clergy far more
than of the whole people; no arrangements were made to implement the
pious gesture of Article 60; the Charter was a victory for feudalism
rather than for democracy. But it defined and safeguarded basic rights;
it established habeas corpus and trial by jury; it gave to an incipient
Parliament a power of the purse that would later arm the nation against
tyranny; it transformed absolute into limited and constitu- tional
monarchy.</p>
<p>John, however, had no idea that he had immortalized himself by
surrender- ing his despotic powers or claims. He signed under duress;
and on the morrow he plotted to annul the Charter. He appealed to the
Pope; and Innocent III, whose policy now required the support of England
against France, came to the defense of his humiliated vassal by
proclaiming the Charter void, and for- bidding John to obey, or the
nobles to enforce, its terms. The barons ignored the decree. Innocent
excommunicated them and the citizens of London and the Five Ports; but
Stephen Langton, who had led in formulating the Charter, refused to
publish the edict. Papal legates in England suspended Langton,
promulgated the decree, raised an army of mercenaries in Flanders and
France, and with it ravaged the English nobility with fire and sword,
plunder, murder, and rape. Apparently the nobles had no dependable
public support; instead of resisting with their own feudal levies they
invited Louis, son of the French King, to invade England, defend them,
and take the English throne as his reward; had the plan succeeded,
England might have become part of France. Papal legates forbade Louis to
cross the Channel, and excommuni- cated him and all his followers when
he persisted. Louis, arriving in London, received the homage and fealty
of the barons. Everywhere outside of mer- cantile London John was
victorious, and merciless. Then, amid the energy and fury of his
triumph, he was struck down by dysentery, made his way painfully to a
monastery, died at Newark in the forty-ninth year of his age.</p>
<p>A papal legate crowned John’s six -year-old son as Henry III
(1216-72); a regency was formed with the earl of Pembroke at its head;
encouraged by this elevation of one of their number, the nobles went
over to Henry, and sent Louis back to France. Henry grew into an
artist-king, a connoisseur of beauty, the inspiration and financier for
the building of Westminster Abbey. He thought the Charter a
disintegrating force, and tried to abrogate it, but failed. He taxed the
nobles within an inch of revolution, always swearing that the latest
levy would be the last. The popes needed money, too, and, with the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>678</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>King’s consent, drew tithes from English parishes to support the wars
of the papacy against Frederick II. The memory of these exactions
prepared the revolts of Wycliffe and Henry VIII.</p>
<p>Edward 1(1272-1 307) was less a scholar than his father, and more a
king; ambitious, strong of will, tenacious in war, subtle in policy,
rich in stratagems and spoils, yet capable of moderation and caution,
and of farseeing purposes that made his reign one of the most successful
in English history. He reorgan- ized the army, trained a large force of
archers in the use of the longbow, and established a national militia by
ordering every able-bodied Englishman to possess, and learn the use of,
arms; unwittingly, he created a military basis for democracy. So
strengthened, he conquered Wales, won and lost Scotland, refused to pay
the tribute that John had promised the popes, and abolished the papal
suzerainty over England. But the greatest event of his reign was the
development of Parliament. Perhaps without willing it, Edward became the
central figure in England’s finest achievement— the reconciliation, in
govern- ment and character, of liberty and law.</p>
<p>4 . The Growth of the Law</p>
<p>It was in this period — from the Norman Conquest to Edward II — that
the law and government of England took the forms which they maintained
till the nineteenth century. Through the superimposition of Norman
feudal upon Anglo-Saxon local law, English law for the first time became
national- no longer the law of Essex or Mercia or the Danelaw, but “the
law and custom of the realm”; we can hardly realize now what a legal
revolution was implied when Ranulf de Glanville (d. 1 190) used this
phrase. 43 Under the stimulus of Henry II, and the guidance of his
justiciar Glanville, English law and courts acquired such repute for
expedition and equity (tempered with corruption) that rival kings in
Spain submitted their dispute to the royal court of Eng- land. 44
Glanville may have been the author of a Treatise on Laws ( Trac tarns de
legibus) traditionally ascribed to him; in any case it is our oldest
textbook of English law. Half a century later (1250-6) Henry de Bracton
achieved the first systematic digest in his five-volume classic On the
Laws and Customs of England (De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae).</p>
<p>The King’s rising need for money and troops forced the expansion of
the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot into the English Parliament. Impatient to
raise more funds than the lords would vote him, Henry III summoned two
knights from each county to join the barons and prelates in the Great
Council of</p>
<ol start="1254" type="1">
<li>When Simon de Montfort, son of a famous Albigensian crusader, led a
revolt of the nobles against Henry III in 1264, he tried to win the
middle classes to his cause by asking not only two knights from each
county, but also two leading citizens from each borough or town, to join
the barons in a</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 679</p>
<p>national assembly. The towns were growing, the merchants had money;
it was worth while consulting these men if they would pay as well as
talk. Ed- ward I profited from Simon’s example. Caught in the toils of
simultaneous wars with Scotland, Wales, and France, he was constrained
to seek the sup- port and funds of all ranks. In 1295 he summoned the
“Model Parliament,” the first complete Parliament in English history.
“What touches all,” his writ</p>
<p>The clergy only reluctantly attended this enlarged Parliament. They
sat apart, and refused to vote supplies except in their provincial
assemblies. Ec- clesiastical courts continued to try all cases involving
canon law, and most cases involving any member of the clergy. Clerics
accused of felonies might be tried by secular authorities; but those
convicted of crimes short of high treason were, through “benefit of
clergy,” handed over to an ecclesiastical court, which alone could
punish them. Moreover, most judges in secular tribunals were
ecclesiastics, for education in law was largely confined to the clergy.
Under Edward I the secular courts became more secular. When the clergy
refused to join in voting supplies, Edward I, arguing that those who
were protected by the state should share its burdens, directed his
courts to hear no cause in which a churchman was plaintiff, but to try
every suit in which a cleric was def endant. 40 In further retaliation
Edward’s Council of 1 279, by the Statute of Mortmain, forbade the grant
of lands to ecclesias- tical bodies without the royal consent.</p>
<p>Despite this divided jurisdiction, English law developed rapidly
under William I, Henry II, John, and Edward I. It was a thoroughly
feudal law, and bore down heavily on the serf; crimes of freemen against
serfs were usually amerced by fines. The law allowed women to own,
inherit, or bequeath property, make contracts, sue and be sued, and gave
the wife a dower right of one third in her husband’s real property; but
all the movable property that she brought to her marriage, or acquired
during it, belonged to her husband. 47 Legally all land belonged to the
king, and was held from him in fief. Nor- mally the whole estate of a
feudal lord was bequeathed to the eldest son, not</p>
<p>68o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>only to keep the property intact, but to protect the feudal suzerain
from a division of vassal responsibility in dues and war. Among the free
peasantry no such rule of primogeniture obtained.</p>
<p>In so feudal a code the law of contract remained immature. An Assize
of Measures (1197) standardized weights, measures, and coins, and
provided state supervision of their use. Enlightened commercial
legislation in England began with the Statute of Merchants (1283) and
the Merchants’ Charter</p>
<p>Legal procedure slowly improved. To enforce the laws every ward had a
“watch,” every borough a constable, every shire a shire -reeve, or
sheriff. All men were bound to raise a “hue and cry” on perceiving a
violation of the law, and to join in pursuing the offender. Bail was
admitted. It is a major credit to English law that torture was not used
in examining suspects or witnesses. When Edward II was induced by Philip
IV of France to arrest the English Templars, he could find no evidence
by which to convict them. Thereupon Pope Clement V, doubtless constrai
ned by Philip, wrote to Edward: “We hear that you forbid torture as
contrary to the laws of your land. But no state law can override canon
law, our law. Therefore I command you at once to submit those men to
torture.” 48 Edward yielded; but torture was not again used in English
legal procedure till the reign of “Bloody” Mary (1553 -8).</p>
<p>The Normans brought to England the old Frank system of inquisitio, or
judicial inquiry by a jurata or sworn group of local citizens, into the
fiscal and legal affairs of a district. The Assize of Clarendon ( c .
1166) developed this “jury” plan by permitting litigants to submit the
question of their veracity</p>
<p>5 . The English Scene</p>
<p>England in 1300 was ninety per cent rural, with a hundred towns whose
modern successors would rank them as villages, and one city, London,
boast- ing of 40,000 population 49 — four times more than any other town
in England, but far inferior in wealth or beauty to Paris, Bruges,
Venice, or Milan, not to speak of Constantinople, Palermo, or Rome.
Houses were of wood, two or three stories high, with gabled roofs; often
the upper story projected beyond</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 68 1</p>
<p>the one beneath. City law forbade emptying the end products of
kitchen, bedroom, or bath through the windows, but the tenants of upper
stories often yielded to the convenience. Most of the slops from the
houses found their way into the current of rain water that ran along the
curbs. It was forbidden to cast feces, permissible to empty urinals,
into this gutter stream. 50 The municipal council did what it could to
improve sanitation — ordered citizens to clean the streets before their
homes, levied fines for negligence, and hired “rakers” to gather garbage
and filth and cart these to dung boats on the Thames. Horses, cattle,
pigs, and poultry were kept by many citizens; but this was no great
evil, since there were many open spaces, and nearly every house had a
garden. Here and there rose a structure of stone like the Temple Church,
Westminster Abbey, or the Tower of London, which William the Conqueror
had built to guard his capital and shelter distinguished prisoners.
Londoners were already proud of their city; soon Froissart would say
that “they are of more weight than all the rest of England, for they are
the most mighty in wealth and men”; and the monk Thomas of Walsingham
would describe them as “of all people almost the most proud, arrogant,
and greedy, disbelieving in ancient customs, disbelieving in God.”
51</p>
<p>Through these centuries the amalgamation of Norman, Anglo-Saxon,
Danish, and Celtic stocks, speech, and ways produced the English nation,
language, and character. As Normandy fell away from England, the Norman
families in Britain forgot Normandy and learned to love their new land.
The mystic and poetic qualities of the Celt remained, especially in the
lower classes, but were tempered by Norman vigor and earthiness. Amid
the strife of nations and classes, and the blows of famine and plague,
the resultant Briton could still make what Henry of Huntingdon (1084?-!
155) called Anglia plena iocis — Merry England — a nation of abounding
energy, rude jests, boisterous games, good fellowship, a love of
dancing, minstrelsy, and ale. From those virile loins and generations
would come the hearty sensuality of Chaucer’s pilgrims, and the
magnificent bombast of the cultured swash - bucklers of the Elizabethan
age.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>IRELAND — SCOTLAND — WALES: 1 066 - 1 3 I 8</li>
</ol>
<p>In the year 1154 Henry II became King of England, and an Englishman,
Nicholas Breakspear, became Pope Hadrian IV. A year later Henry sent
John of Salisbury to Rome with a subtle message: Ireland was in a state
of political chaos, literary decline, moral debasement, religious
independence and decay; would not the Pope permit Henry to take
possession of the individualistic isle and restore it to social order
and papal obedience? If we may believe Giraldus Cambrensis, the Pope
agreed, and by the bull Landabiliter granted Ireland to Henry on
condition of restoring orderly government there, bringing the</p>
<p>68z</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>Irish clergy into better co-operation with Rome, and arranging that a
penny (83$) should be paid yearly to the See of Peter for every house in
Ireland. 52 Henry was too busy at the time to take advantage of this
nihil obstat but he remained in a receptive mood.</p>
<p>In 1 166 Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster, was defeated in war by
Tiernan O’Rourke, King of Brefni, whose wife he had seduced. Expelled by
his subjects, he fled with his beautiful daughter Eva to England and
France, and secured from Henry II a letter assuring royal good will to
any of his subjects who should help Dermot to regain the Leinster
throne. At Bristol Dermot received from Richard FitzGilbert, Earl of
Pembroke in Wales, known as “Strongbow,” a pledge of military support in
return for Eva’s hand in marriage, and the succession to Dermot’s
kingdom. In 1 169 Richard led a small force of Welshmen into Ireland,
restored Dermot with the help of the Leinster clergy, and, on Dermot’s
death ( 1 1 7 1 ) inherited the kingdom. Rory O’Connor, then High King
of Ireland, led an army against the Welsh in - vaders, and bottled them
up in Dublin. The besieged made an heroic sortie, and the ill-trained
and poorly equipped Irish fled. Summoned by Henry II, Strongbow crossed
to Wales, met the King, and agreed to surrender to him Dublin and other
Irish ports, and to hold the rest of Leinster in fief from the English
crown. Henry landed near Waterford ( 1 1 7 1 ) with 4000 men, won the
support of the Irish clergy, and received the allegiance of all Ireland
ex- cept Connaught and Ulster; the Welsh conquest was turned into a
Norman- English conquest without a battle. A synod of Irish prelates
declared their full submission to the Pope, and decreed that thereafter
the ritual of the Irish Church should conform to that of England and
Rome. Most of the Irish kings were allowed to keep their thrones, on
condition of feudal fealty and annual tribute to the king of
England.</p>
<p>Henry had accomplished his purpose with economy and skill, but he
erred in thinking that the forces which he left behind him could sustain
order and peace. His appointees fought one another for the spoils, and
their aides and troops plundered the country with a minimum of
restraint. The conquerors did their best to reduce the Irish to serfdom.
The Irish resisted with guer- rilla warfare, and the result was a
century of turmoil and destruction. In 1315 some Irish chieftains
offered Ireland to Scotland, where Robert Bruce had just defeated the
English at Bannockburn. Robert’s brother Edward landed in Ireland with
6000 men; Pope John XXII pronounced excommu- nication upon all who
should aid the Scots; but nearly all Irishmen rose at Edward’s call, and
in 1316 they crowned him King. Two years later he was defeated and slain
near Dundalk, and the revolt collapsed in poverty and despair.</p>
<p>The Scots, said Ranulf Higden, a fourteenth- century Briton, “be
light of heart, strong and wild enough; but by mixing with Englishmen,
they be</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 683</p>
<p>much amended. They be cruel upon their enemies, and hate bondage most
of anything, and hold it foul sloth if any man dieth in bed, and great
wor- ship if he die in the field.” 53</p>
<p>Ireland remained Irish but lost its liberty; Scotland became British,
but remained free. Angles, Saxons, and Normans multiplied in the
lowlands, and reorganized agricultural life on a feudal plan. Malcolm
III (1058-93) was a warrior who repeatedly invaded England; but his
Queen Margaret was an Anglo-Saxon princess whet converted the Scottish
court to the English lan- guage, brought in English-speaking clergy, and
reared her sons in English ways. The last and strongest of them, David I
(1124-53), made the Church his chosen instrument of rule, founded
English-speaking monasteries at Kelso, Dryburgh, Melrose, and Holyrood,
levied tithes (for the first time in Scot- land) for the support of the
Church, and gave so lavishly to bishops and abbots that people mistook
him for a saint. Under David I Scotland, in all but its highlands,
became an English state. 54</p>
<p>But it was not the less independent. The English immigrants were
trans- formed into patriotic Scots; from their number came the Stuarts
and the Bruces. David I invaded and captured Northumberland; Malcolm IV
( 1 1 5 3 —</p>
<ol start="65" type="1">
<li>lost it; William the Lion (1165-1214), trying to regain it, was
taken prisoner by Henry II, and was freed only on pledging homage to the
king of England for the Scottish crown (1174). Fifteen years later he
bought re- lease from this pledge by helping to finance Richard I in the
Third Crusade, but the English kings continued to claim feudal
suzerainty over Scotland. Alexander III ( 1 249-86) recovered the
Hebrides from Norway, maintained friendly relations with England, and
gave Scotland a golden age of prosper- ity and peace.</li>
</ol>
<p>At Alexander’s death Robert Bruce an d John Balliol, descendants of
David I, contested the succession. Edward I of England seized the
opportunity; by his support Balliol was made King, but acknowledged the
overlordship of England ( 1 292) . When, however, Edward ordered Balliol
to raise troops to fight for England in France, the Scotch nobles and
bishops rebelled, and bade Balliol make alliance with France against
England ( 1 295). Edward defeated the Scots at Dunbar (1296), received
the submission of the aristocracy, de- throned Balliol, appointed three
Englishmen to rule Scotland for him, and returned to England.</p>
<p>Many Scotch nobles owned land in England, and were thereby mort-
gaged to obedience. But the older Gaelic Scots strongly resented the
surren- der. One of them, Sir Willia m Wallace, organized an “army of
the commons of Scotland,” routed the English garrison, and for a year
ruled Scotland as regent for Balliol. Edward returned, and defeated
Wallace at Falkirk ( 1 298) . In 1305 he captured Wallace and had him
disemboweled and quartered ac- cording to the English law of
treason.</p>
<p>A year later another defender was forced into the field. Robert
Bruce,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>684</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>grandson of the Bruce who had claimed the throne in 1286, quarreled
with John Comyn, a leading representative of Edward I in Scotland, and
killed him. Thereby committed to rebellion, Bruce had himself crowned
King, though only a small group of nobles supported him, and the pope
excommu- nicated him for his crime. Edward once more marched north, but
died on the way (1307). Edward IPs incompetence was a blessing for
Bruce; the nobles and clergy of Scotland rallied to the outlaw’s banner;
his reinforced</p>
<p>Meanwhile a like struggle had come to other issue in Wales. William I
claimed suzerainty over it as part of the realm of the defeated Harold.
He had no time to add it to his conquests, but he set up three earldoms
on its eastern frontier, and encouraged their lords to expand them into
Wales. South Wales was meanwhile overrun by Norman buccaneers, who left
the prefix Fitz (fils, son) on some Welsh names. In 1094 Cadwgan ap
Bledyn subdued these Normans; in 1165 the Welsh defeated the English at
Corwen; and Henry II, busy with Becket, acknowledged the independence of
South Wales under its enlightened King Rhys ap Gruffydd ( 1 1 7 1 ) .
Llywelyn the Great, by his ability in both war and statesmanship,
extended his rule over nearly all the country. His sons quarreled and
disordered the land, but his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffydd (d. 1 282)
restored unity, made peace with Henry III, and created for himself the
title of Prince of Wales. Edward I, intent on uniting Wales and Scotland
with England, invaded Wales with an immense army and fleet (1282) ;
Llywelyn died in a chance encounter with a small border force; his
brother David was captured by Edward, and his severed head, with
Llywelyn’s, was suspended from the Tower of London and left to bleach in
the sun, wind, and rain. Wales was made a part of Eng- land (1284), and
Edward in 1301 gave the title of Prince of Wales to the heir to the
English throne.</p>
<p>Through these exaltations and depressions the Welsh kept their own
lan- guage and their old customs, tilled their rough soil with obstinate
courage, and solaced their days and nights with legend, poetry, music,
and song. Their bards now gave form to the tales of th tMabinogion,
enriching literature with a mystic melodious tenderness uniquely Welsh.
Annually the bards and min- strels assembled in a national eisteddfod
(from eistedd , to sit), which can be</p>

<p>685</p>
<p>traced back to 1176; contests were held in oratory, poetry, singing,
and the playing of musical instruments. The Welsh could fight bravely,
but not long; they were soon eager to return and protect at first hand
their women, chil- dren, and homes; and one of their proverbs wished
that “every ray of the sun were a poniard to pierce the friends of war.”
55</p>
<p>X. THE RHINELANDS: 1066-1315</p>
<p>The countries huddled about the lower Rhine and its many mouths were
among the richest in the medieval world. South of the Rhine lay the
county of Flanders, running from Calais through modern Belgium to the
Scheldt. Formally it was a fief held from the French king; actually it
was ruled by a dynasty of enlightened counts, checked only by the proud
autonomy of the towns. Near the Rhine the people were Flemish, of Low
German origin, and spoke a German dialect; west of the Lys River they
were Walloons — a mixture of Germans and French on a Celtic base — and
spoke a dialect of French. Commerce and industry fattened and disturbed
Ghent, Audenaarde, Courtrai, Ypres, and Kassel in the Flemish northeast,
and Bruges, Lille, and Douai in the Walloon southwest; in these cities
population was denser than anywhere else in Europe north of the Alps. In
1300 the cities dominated the counts; the magistrates of the larger
communities formed a supreme court for the county, and negotiated on
their own authority with foreign cities and governments. 56 Usually the
counts co-operated with the cities, encouraged manufactures and trade,
maintained a stable currency, and as early as 1100 — two centuries
before England — established uniform measures and weights for all the
towns.</p>
<p>The class war ultimately destroyed the freedom of both the cities and
the counts. As the proletariat rose in number, resentment, and power,
and the counts sided with them as an offset to the bumptious bourgeoisie
, the mer- chants sought support from Philip Augustus of France, who
promised it in the hope of bringing Flanders effectively under the
French crown. England, anxious to keep the chief market for her wool out
of the control of the French king, allied herself with the counts of
Flanders and Hainault, the duke of Bra- bant, and Otto IV of Germany.
Philip defeated this coalition at Bouvines (1214), subdued the counts,
and protected the merchants in their oligarchic regime. The conflict of
powers and classes continued. In 1297 Count Guy de Dampierre again
allied Flanders with England; Philip the Fair invaded Flanders,
imprisoned Guy, and forced him to cede the country to France. But when
the French army moved to occupy Bruges the commons rose, overcame the
troops, massacred rich merchants, and gained possession of the town.
Philip sent a large army to avenge this affront; the workers of the</p>
<p>686 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>towns formed themselves into an impromptu army, and defeated the
knights and mercenaries of France in the battle of Courtrai (1302). The
aged Guy de Dampierre was released and restored, and the strange
alliance of feudal counts and revolutionary proletaires enjoyed a decade
of victory.</p>
<p>What we now know as Holland was, from the third to the ninth century,
part of the Frank kingdom. In 843 it became the northernmost portion of
the buffer state of Lorraine created by the Treaty of Verdun. In the
ninth and tenth centuries it was divided into feudal fiefs for better
resistance to Norse raids. The Germans who cleared and settled the
heavily wooded dis- trict north of the Rhine called it Holtland, i.e.,
Woodland. Most of the people were serfs, absorbed in the struggle to
wrest a living from a land that had always to be diked or drained; half
of Holland exists by the taming of the sea. But there were cities, too,
not quite as rich and turbulent as the Flemish towns, but soundly based
on steady industry and orderly trade. Dordrecht was the most prosperous;
Utrecht was a center of learning; Haarlem was the seat of the Count of
Holland; Delft became the capital for a time; then, toward 1250, The
Hague.* Amsterdam made its debut in 1 204, when a feudal lord built a
fortress chateau at the mouth of the Amstel River; the sheltered site on
the Zuider Zee, and the pervasive canals, invited commerce; in 1297 the
city was made a free port, where goods could be received and reshipped
free of customs duties; and thenceforth little Holland played a large
part in the economic world. There as elsewhere commerce nourished
culture; in the thirteenth century we find a Dutch poet, Maerlant, who
vigorously satirized the luxurious life of the clergy; and in the
monasteries Dutch art, in sculp- ture, pottery, painting, and
illumination, was beginning its unique and ex- traordinary career.</p>
<p>South of Holland lay the duchy of Brabant, which then contained the
cities of Antwerp, Brussels, and Louvain. Liege was ruled independently
by its bishops, who allowed it a large measure of autonomy. Still
farther south were the counties of Hainault, Namur, Limburg, and
Luxembourg; the duchy of Lorraine, with the cities of Trier, Nancy, and
Metz; and several other prin- cipalities, nominally subject to the
German emperor, but left for the most part to their ruling counts. Each
of these districts had a vibrant history of politics, love, and war; we
salute them and move on. South and west of them lay Burgundy, in what is
now east central France; its varying boundaries discourage definition;
its political fortunes would fill vain tomes. In 888 Ru- dolf I made it
an independent kingdom; in 1032 Rudolf III bequeathed it to Germany; but
in that year part of it was united, as a duchy, to France. The dukes of
Burgundy, like its early kings, governed with intelligence, and for *
The counts had previously used the place as a hunting rendezvous; hence
its name, V Graven Haag , the Count’s Lodge, now den Haag.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 687</p>
<p>the most part cherished peace. Their great age would come in the
fifteenth century.</p>
<p>In classical times Switzerland was the home of diverse tribes —
Helvetii, Raeti, Lepontii — of mixed Celtic, Teutonic, and Italic
origin. In the third cen- tury the Alemanni occupied and Germanized the
northern plateau. After the collapse of the Carolingian Empire the land
was divided into feudal fiefs subject to the Holy Roman Empire. But it
is difficult to enslave mountain- eers; and the Swiss, while
acknowledging some feudal dues, soon liberated themselves from serfdom.
The villages in democratic assemblies chose their own officials, and
ruled themselves by the ancient Germanic laws of the Alemanni and
Burgundians. For mutual protection the peasants neighboring Lake Lucerne
formed themselves into “Forest Cantons” (Waldstatte)— Uri, Nidwalden,
and Schwyz, which later gave its name to the state. The sturdy burghers
of the towns that had grown along the Alpine passes — Geneva, Con-
stance, Fribourg, Berne, and Basel — elected their own officials, and
adminis- tered their own laws. Their feudal overlords raised no
objection to this so long as basic feudal taxes were paid. 57</p>
<p>The Hapsburg counts who, from 1173, held the northern districts,
proved an exception to this rule, and earned the hatred of the men of
Schwyz by attempting to apply feudal dues in full severity. In 1291 the
three Forest Cantons formed an “Everlasting League,” and swore a
confederatio to give one another aid against external aggression or
internal disturbance, to arbi- trate all differences, and to recognize
no judge who was not a native of the valley, or had bought his office.
Lucerne, Zurich, and Constance soon joined the League. In 1315 the
Hapsburg dukes sent two armies into Switzerland to enforce all feudal
dues. In the pass of Morgarten the infantry of Schwyz and Uri, armed
with halberds, defeated the Austrian cavalry in “the Mara - thon of
Switzerland.” The Austrian forces withdrew; the three cantons renewed
their oath of mutual support (December 9, 1315), and created the Swiss
Confederacy. It was not yet an independent state; the free citizens
acknowledged certain feudal obligations, and the suzerainty of the Holy
Roman Emperor. But feudal lords and holy emperors had learned to respect
the arms and liberties of the Swiss cantons and towns; and the victory
of Morgarten had opened the way to the most stable and sensible
democracy in history.*</p>

</ol>
<p>At the accession of Philip II Augustus (1180) France was a minor and
harassed state, hardly promising any grandeur to come. England held Nor-
mandy, Brittany, Anjou, Touraine, and Aquitaine — a domain thrice the
size of that directly controlled by the French king. Most of Burgundy
adhered to Germany, and the flourishing county of Flanders was in effect
an inde- pendent principality. So were the counties of Lyons, Savoy, and
Chambery. So was Provence — southeastern France — rich in wine, oil,
fruit, poets, and the cities of Arles and Avignon, Aix and Marseille.
The Dauphine, center- ing about Vienne, had been bequeathed to Germany
as part of Burgundy; it was now independently ruled by a dauphin who
took his title from the dolphin that was an emblem of his family.</p>
<p>France proper was divided into duchies, counties, seignories,
seneschalties, and bailliages (bailiwicks) governed — in order of
increasing dependence upon the king — by dukes, counts, seigneurs,
seneschals (royal stewards), and bailiffs. This loose aggregation,
already called Francia in the ninth century, was in diverse degrees, and
with many limitations, subject to the French king. Paris, his capital,
was in 1 180 a city of wooden buildings and muddy streets; its Roman
name, Lutetia, had meant the town of mud. Philip Augustus, shocked by
the smell of the thoroughfares that ran beside the Seine, ordered that
all the streets of Paris should be paved with solid stone. 59</p>
<p>He was the first of three powerful rulers who in this age raised
France to the intellectual, moral, and political leadership of Europe.
But there had been strong men before him. Philip I (1060-1 108) made a
secure niche for him- self in history by divorcing his wife at forty and
persuading Count Fulk of Anjou to cede to him the Countess Bertrade. A
priest was found to solemnize the adultery as marriage, but Pope Urban
II, coming to France to preach the First Crusade, excommunicated the
King. Philip persisted in sin for twelve years; at last he sent Bertrade
away and was shriven; but a while later he repented his repentance, and
resumed his Queen. She traveled with him to Anjou, taught her two
husbands amity, and seems to have served both of them to the best of her
charms. 60</p>
<p>Having grown fat at forty-five, Philip handed over the major affairs
of state to his son Louis VI (1 108-37), himself known as Louis the Fat.
He deserved a better name. For twenty-four years he fought, finally with
suc- cess, the robber barons who plundered travelers on the roads; he
strength- ened the monarchy by organizing a competent army; he did what
he could to protect the peasants, the artisans, and the communes; and he
had the good sense to make the Abbot Suger his chief minister and
friend. Suger of St.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 689</p>
<p>Denis (1081-1151) was the Richelieu of the twelfth century. He
managed the affairs of France with wisdom, justice, and farsight; he
encouraged and improved agriculture; he designed and built one of the
earliest and finest masterpieces of the Gothic style; and he wrote an
illuminating account of his ministry and work. He was the most valuable
bequest left by Louis the Fat to his son, whom Suger served till
death.</p>
<p>Louis VII ( 1 137-80) was the man of whom Eleanor of Aquitaine said
that she had married a king only to find him a monk. He labored
conscientiously at his royal tasks, but his virtues ruined him. His
devotion to government appeared to Eleanor as marital neglect; his
patience with her amours added insult to negligence; she divorced him,
and gave her hand and her duchy of Aquitaine to Henry II of England.
Disillusioned with life, Louis turned to piety, and left to his son the
task of building a strong France.</p>
<p>Philip II Augustus, like a later Philippe, was a bourgeois
gentilhomme on the throne: a master of practical intelligence softened
with sentiment, a pa- tron of learning with no taste for it, a man of
shrewd caution and prudent courage, of quick temper and ready amnesty,
of unscrupulous but controlled acquisitiveness, of a moderated piety
that could be generous to the Church without allowing religion to
countermand his politics, and of a patient per- severance that won what
bold adventurousness might never have attained. Such a man, at once
prosaic and august e* amiably inflexible and ruthlessly wise, was what
his country needed at a time when, between Henry IPs Eng- land and
Barbarossa’s Germany, France might have ceased to be.</p>
<p>His marriages disturbed Europe. His first wife, Isabella, died in
1189; and four years later he married Ingeborg, a princess of Denmark.
These mar- riages were political, and brought more property than
romance. Ingeborg was not to Philip’s taste; he ignored her after a day;
and within the year he persuaded a council of French bishops to grant
him a divorce. Pope Celestine III refused to confirm the decree. In
1196, defying the Pope, he married Agnes of Meran. Celestine
excommunicated him, but Philip remained obsti- nate; “I had rather lose
half my domains,” he sai d in a moment of tender- ness, “than separate
from Agnes.” Innocent III commanded him to take back Ingeborg; when
Philip refused, the invincible Pope interdicted religious services in
Philip’s domain. Philip, in a rage, deposed all bishops who obeyed t he
interdict. “Happy Saladin!” he mourned, “who had no pope above him”; and
he threatened to turn Mohammedan. 01 After four years of this spiritual
war the people began to grumble with fear of hell. Philip dismissed his
be- loved Agnes (1202), but kept Ingeborg confined at Etampes till 1213,
when he recalled her to his bed.</p>
<p>Amid these joys and tribulations Philip reconquered Normandy from
England ( 1 204), and in the next two years annexed Brittany, Anjou,
Maine,</p>

<p>Touraine, and Poitou to his directly ruled terrain. He was now strong
enough to dominate all the dukes, counts, and seigneurs of his realm;
his baillis and seneschals supervised local government; his kingdom had
become an inter- national power, not a strip of land along the Seine.
John of England, so shorn, was not resigned; he persuaded Otto IV of
Germany and the counts of Boulogne and Flanders to join him against this
swelling France; John would attack through Aquitaine (still England’s) ,
the others from the north - east. Instead of dividing his forces to meet
these separate assaults, Philip led his main army agai nst John’s
allies, and defeated them at Bouvines, near Lille (1214). That battle
decided many issues. It deposed Otto, secured the Ger- man throne to
Frederick II, ended German hegemony, and hastened the decline of the
Holy Roman Empire. It reduced the counts of Flanders to French
obedience, added Amiens, Douai, Lille, and St. Quentin to the French
crown, and in effect extended northeastern France to the Rhine. It left
John helpless against his barons, and forced him to sign Magna Carta. It
weakened monarchy and strengthened feudalism in England and Germany,
while it strengthened monarchy and weakened feudalism in France. And it
favored the growth of the French communes and middle classes, which had
vigor- ously supported Philip in peace and war.</p>
<p>Having trebled the royal domain, Philip governed it with devotion and
skill. Half the time at odds with the Church, he replaced ecclesiastics
in council and administration with men from the rising lawyer class. He
gave charters of autonomy to many cities, encouraged trade by privileges
to merchants, alternately protected and plundered the Jews, and fattened
his exchequer by commuting feudal services into money payments; the
royal revenue was doubled from 600 to 1200 livres (40,000) a day. In his
reign the facade of Notre Dame was completed, and the Louvre was built
as a fortress to guard the Seine. 02 When Philip died (1223) the France
of today had been born.</p>

<p>2 . St. Louis</p>
<p>His son Louis VIII(i223-6) ruled too briefly to accomplish much ;
history remembers him chiefly for having married the admirable Blanche
of Castile, and begetting by her the one man in medieval history who,
like Ashoka in ancient India, succeeded in being at once and in fact a
saint and a king. Louis IX was twelve, his mother was thirty-eight, when
Louis VIII died. Daugh- ter of Alfonso IX of Castile, granddaughter of
Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Blanche lived up to her royal blood.
She was a woman of beauty and charm, energy, character, and skill; at
the same time she impressed her age by her untarnished virtue as wife
and widow, and her devotion as the mother of eleven children; France
honored her not only as Blanche la bonne reine, but equally as Blanche
la bonne mere. She freed many serfs on the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 691</p>
<p>royal estates, spent great sums on charity, and provided dowries for
girls whose poverty discouraged love. She helped to finance the building
of Chartres Cathedral, and it was through her influence that its stained
glass showed Mary not as virgin but as queen. 63 She loved her son Louis
too jeal- ously, and was ungenerous to his wife. She trained him
sedulously to Chris- tian virtue, and told him that she would rather see
him dead than have him commit a mortal sin; 64 but it was not her doing
that he became a devotee. She herself rarely sacrificed policy to
sentiment; she joined in the cruel Albi- gensian Crusade to extend the
power of the crown in southern France. For nine years (1226-35), while
Louis grew up, she governed the realm; and seldom has France been better
ruled. At the outset of her regency the barons revolted, thinking to
recapture from a woman the powers they had lost to Philip II; she
overcame them with wise and patient diplomacy. She resisted England
ably, and then signed a truce on just terms. When Louis IX came of age
and assumed the government, he inherited a kingdom powerful, pros-
perous, and at peace.</p>
<p>He was a handsome lad, taller by a head than most of his knights,
with finely cut features, clear skin, and rich blond hair; elegant in
tastes, fond of luxurious furniture and colorful clothes; no bookworm,
but given to hunt- ing and falconry, amusements and athletic games; not
yet a saint, for a monk complained to Blanche of the royal flirtations;
she found him a wife, and he settled down. He became a model of conjugal
fidelity and parental en- ergy; he had eleven children, and took an
intimate share in their education. Gradually he abandoned luxury, lived
more and more simply, and consumed himself in government, charity, and
piety. He had a kingly conception of monarchy as an organ of national
unity and continuity, and as a protection of the poor and weak against
the superior or fortunate few.</p>
<p>He respected the rights of the nobles, encouraged them to fulfill
their obligations to serfs and vassals and suzerain, but would brook no
feudal infringements of the new royal power. He interfered resolutely to
repress injustices of lord to man, and in several cases severely
punished barons who had executed men without due trial. When Enguerrand
de Coucy hanged three Flemish students for killing some rabbits on his
estate, Louis had him locked up in the tower of the Louvre, threatened
to hang him, and released him on condition that he build three chapels
where Masses were to be said daily for his victims; that he give the
forest where the young scholars had hunted to the abbey of St. Nicholas;
that he lose on his estates the rights of jurisdiction and hunting; that
he serve three years in Palestine; and pay the King a fine of 12,500
pounds. 05 Louis forbade feud vengeance and pri- vate feudal war, and
condemned the judicial duel. As trial by evidence re- placed trial by
combat, the baronial courts were progressively superseded by the royal
courts organized in each locality by the bailiffs of the King; the right
of appeal from baronial judges to the central royal court was es-</p>

<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>tablished; and in France, as in England, the thirteenth century saw
feudal law give way to a common law of the realm. Never since Roman days
had France enjoyed such security and prosperity; in this reign the
wealth of France sufficed to bring Gothic architecture to its greatest
abundance and perfection.</p>
<p>He believed and proved that a government could be just and generous
in its foreign relations without losing prestige and power. He avoided
war as long as possible; but when aggression threatened he organized his
armies efficiently, planned his campaigns, and — in Europe — carried
them through with energy and skill to an honorable peace that left no
passion for revenge. As soon as the safety of France was assured, he
adopted a policy of concilia- tion which accepted the compromise of
opposed rights while rejecting the appeasement of unjust claims. He
restored to England and Spain territory that his predecessors had
seized; his councilors mourned, but peace endured, and France remained
free from attack even during the long absences of Louis on crusades .
“Men feared him,” said William of Chartres, “because they knew that he
was just.” 66 From 1243 to 1270 France waged no war against a Christian
foe. When her neighbors fought one another Louis labored to reconcile
them, scorning the suggestion of his council that such strife should be
fomented to weaken potential enemies. 67 Foreign kings submitted their
disputes to his arbitration. People marveled that so good a man should
be so good a king.</p>
<p>He was not “that perfect monster whom the world ne’er knew”— the
completely faultless man. He was occasionally irritable, perhaps through
ill health. The simplicity of his soul sometimes verged upon culpable
ignorance or credulity, as in the ill-conceived crusades and maladroit
campaigns in Egypt and Tunisia, where he lost many lives besides his
own; and though he was honest with his Moslem enemies he could not apply
to them the same generous understanding that had succeeded so well with
his Christian foes. His childlike certitude of belief led him to a
religious intolerance that helped to establish the Inquisition in
France, and it quieted his natural pity for the victims of the
Albigensian Crusade. His treasury was swelled by confiscating the goods
of condemned heretics, 08 and his usual good humor failed him toward the
French Jews.</p>
<p>But with these deductions he came nobly close to the Christian ideal.
“On no day of my life,” reports Joinville, “did I ever hear him speak
evil of any - one.” 69 When his Moslem captors accepted by mistake a sum
1 0,00 0 livres (,000,000) short of the ransom promised for his release,
Louis, restored safely to freedom, sent to the Saracens the additional
payment in full, to the disgust of his councilors. 70 Before leaving on
his first crusade he bade his officials, throughout his realm, to
“receive in writing, and to examine, the grievances that may be brought
against us or our ancestors, as also allegations of injustices or
exactions of which our bailiffs, provosts, foresters, sergeants.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 693</p>
<p>or their subordinates may have been guilty.” 71 “Ofttimes,” says
Joinville, “he would go, after Mass, and seat himself against a tree in
the wood of Vincennes, and make us sit around him. And all those who had
any cause in hand came a nd spoke to him without hindrance or usher.” He
would settle some cases himself, and turn others over to the councilors
seated about him, but he gave each pleader the right of appeal to the
king. 72 He founded and endowed hospitals, asylums, monasteries,
hospices, a home for the blind, and another (the Filles-Dieu) for
redeemed prostitutes. He ordered his agents in each province to search
out the old and poor and provide for them at the public expense.
Wherever he went he made it a principle to feed, every day, 1 20 poor
people; he had three of them join him for dinner, served them himself,
and washed their feet. 73 Like Henry III of England, he waited on
lepers, and fed them with his own hands. When famine struck Normandy he
spent an enormous sum getting food to the needy there. He gave alms
daily to the sick, the poor, widows, women in confinement, prostitutes,
disabled workingmen, “so that hardly it would be possible to number his
alms.” 74 Nor were these acts of charity spoiled by publicity. The poor
whose feet he washed were chosen from the blind; the act was done in
private, and the recipients were not told that their attendant was the
king. His ascetic self-lacerations were unknown to others until revealed
on his flesh after his death. 75</p>
<p>In the campaign of 1242 he contracted malaria in the marshy regions
of Saintonge; it brought on pernicious anemia, and in 1244 he was near
death. Perhaps such experiences turned him more and more to religion;
indeed, it was on recovering from that illness that he took the oath to
crusade. He weakened himself with ascetic self-mortification. When he
returned from his first crusade, aged only thirty-eight, he was already
bent and bald, and nothing remained of his youthful beauty except the
radiant grace of his simple faith and good will. He wore a hair shirt
under a monk’s brown robe, and had himself scourged with little iron
chains. He loved the new monastic orders, Franciscans and Dominicans,
gave to them without stint, and was with difficulty dissuaded from
himself becoming a Franciscan. He heard two Masses daily, recited the
canonical prayers of tierce, sext, none, vespers, and compline, said
fifty Ave Marias before retiring, and rose at midnight to join the
priests at matins in the chapel. 70 He abstained from marital inter-
course in Advent and Lent. Most of his subjects smiled at his devotions,
and called him “Brother Louis.” One bold woman told him: “It would be
better that another should be king in your place, for you are only king
of the Franciscans and the Dominicans. … It is an outrage that you
should be king of France. It is a great marvel that they don’t put you
out.” Louis replied: “You tell the truth … I am not worthy to be king,
and if it had pleased our Saviour, another would have been in my place,
who would have known better how to govern the kingdom.” 77</p>
<p>694 the age of faith (chap. XXV</p>
<p>He shared with enthusiasm in the superstitions of his time. The abbey
of St. Denis claimed to have a nail from the True Cross; one day the
nail was mislaid after its ceremonial exhibition to the people; a great
furore arose; the nail was found, and the King was much relieved; “I had
rather,” he said, “that the best city in my kingdom had been swallowed
up.” 78 In 1236 Bald - win II of Constantinople, appealing for funds to
rescue his ailing state, sold to Louis for 1 1,000 livres (,200,000) the
crown of thorns worn by Jesus during His Passion. Five years later Louis
bought from the same auctioneer a piece of the True Cross. Possibly
these purchases were intended as grants in aid to a Christian kingdom in
distress. To receive the relics Louis com- missioned Peter of Montreuil
to build Sainte Chapelle.</p>
<p>With all his deep piety Louis was no tool of the clergy. He
recognized their human shortcomings, and chastised them with good
example and open rebuke. 79 He restricted the powers of ecclesiastical
courts, and asserted the authority of the law over all citizens, lay or
clerical. In 1268 he issued the first Pragmatic Sanction, limiting the
power of the papacy in ecclesiastical appointments and taxation in
France: “We will that no one may raise or collect in any manner
exactions or assessments of money, which have been imposed by the court
of Rome . . . unless the cause be reasonable, pious, most urgent . . .
and recognized by our express and spontaneous consent, and by that of
the Church of our realm.” #</p>
<p>Despite his monastic propensities Louis always remained the king, and
preserved the royal majesty even when, as Fra Salimbene describes him,
“spare and slender, having the face of an angel, and a countenance full
of grace,” 81 he appeared on foot, in pilgrim’s habit and with pilgrim’s
staff, to begin his first crusade (1248). Queen Blanche, whom he left,
despite her sixty years, as regent with the fullest powers, wept as they
parted: “Most sweet fair son, fair tender son, I shall never see you
more.” 82 He was cap - tured in Egypt, and was held for a ransom that
Blanche with great difficulty raised and paid; but when, defeated and
humbled, he returned to France (1252), he found his mother dead. In
1270, weak with illness, he set out again, this time for Tunisia. It was
not so quixotic an enterprise as its failure made it out to be. Louis
had allowed his brother, Charles of Anjou, to lead a French army into
Italy not only to check German domination there, but also in the hope
that Sicily might be made a base for a French invasion of Tunisia.
Shortly after reaching Tunisia the great crusader, older in body than in
years, died of dysentery. Twenty-seven years later the Church can-
onized him. Generations and centuries looked back to his reign as the
Golden Age of France, and wondered why an inscrutable Providence would
not send them his like again. He was a Christian king.</p>

<p>THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE</p>
<p>&lt;5 95</p>
<p>3 . Philip the Fair</p>
<p>France was strengthened by the Crusades, in which she took a leading
part. The long reigns of Philip Augustus and Louis IX gave her
government continuity and stability, while England suffered the
negligent Richard I, the reckless John, and the incompetent Henry III,
and while Germany dis- integrated in the wars between the emperors and
the popes. By 1300 France was the strongest power in Europe.</p>
<p>Philip IV (1285-1314) was called le Bel for his handsome figure and
face, not for his subtle statecraft and pitiless audacity. His aims were
vast: to bring all classes — nobles and clergy as well as townsmen and
serfs — under the direct law and control of the king; to base French
growth on commerce and industry rather than on agriculture; and to
extend the boundaries of France to the Atlantic, the Pyrenees, the
Mediterranean, the Alps, and the Rhine. He chose his aides and
councilors not from the great ecclesiastics and barons who had served
French kings for four centuries past, but from the lawyer class that
came to him impregnate with the imperial ideas of Roman law. Pierre
Flotte and Guillaume de Nogaret were brilliant intellects careless of
morals and precedents; under their guidance Philip rebuilt the legal
structure of France, replaced feudal with royal law, overcame his foes
by shrewd diplomacy, and in the end broke the power of the papacy, and
made the pope in effect a prisoner of France. He tried to detach Guienne
from England, but found Edward I too strong for him. He won Champagne,
Brie, and Navarre by marriage, and bought with hard cash Chartres,
Franche- Comte, the Lyonnais, and part of Lorraine.</p>
<p>Always needing money, he spent half his wits and time inventing taxes
and raising funds. He commuted for money the military obligations of the
bar- ons to the crown. He repeatedly debased the coinage, and insisted
on taxes being paid in bullion or in honest coin. He exiled the Jews and
the Lom- bards, and destroyed the Templars, to confiscate their wealth.
He forbade the export of precious metal from his realm. He laid heavy
taxes upon ex- ports, imports, and sales, and a war tax of a penny upon
every livre of pri- vate wealth in France. Finally, without consulting
the pope, he taxed the wealth of the Church, which now owned a quarter
of the land of France. The results belong to the story of Boniface VIII.
When the old Pope, broken by the struggle, died, Philip’s agents and
money secured the election of a Frenchman as Clement V, and the removal
of the papacy to Avignon. Never had any layman won so great a victory
over the Church. Henceforth, in France, the lawyers ruled the
priests.</p>
<p>The grand master of the Templars, as he went to the stake, predicted
that Philip would follow him within a year. It so befell; and not only
Philip but Clement too died in 1314 — the triumphant King aged only
forty-six. The</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>696</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>French people had admired his tenacity and courage, and had upheld
him against Boniface; but they cursed his memory as the most grasping
monarch in their history. France was almost broken by his victory. His
debased cur- rency disordered the national economy, high rents and
prices impoverished the people, taxation retarded industry, and the
banishment of the Lombards and the Jews crippled the sinews of commerce
and ruined the great fairs. The prosperity that had mounted under Louis
the Saint declined under the master of every trick of law and diplomatic
craft. 83</p>
<p>Three sons of Philip mounted the throne and descended into the grave
within fourteen years of his death. None of them left sons to inherit
his power. Charles IV (d. 1 3 28) left daughters, but the old Salic law
was invoked to refuse them the crown. The nearest male heir of the royal
family was Philip of Valois, nephew of Philip the Fair. With his
accession the direct line of the Capetian kings ended, and the rule of
the House of Valois began.</p>
<p>A coup d’oeil of France in this period shows remarkable advances in
econ- omy, law, education, literature, and art. Serfdom was rapidly
disappearing as the growth of urban industry lured men from the farms.
Paris in 1314 had some 200,000 inhabitants, France some 2 2,ooo,ooo. 84
Brunetto Latini, fleeing from the political violence of Florence,
marveled at the peace and security that reigned in the streets of Paris
under Louis IX, the busy handi- crafts and commerce of the towns, the
fruitful fields and vineyards of the pleasant countryside around the
capital. 85</p>
<p>The rise of the business and professional classes, almost rivaling
the nobil - ity in wealth, compelled their representation in the Btats
generaux, or States- General, which Philip IV summoned to Paris in 1 302
to give him moral and financial support in his conflict with Boniface.
Such general assemblies of the three estates or classes — nobles,
clergy, commons — were called only in emergencies (1302, 1308, 1314 . .
.), and were cleverly guided by the law- yers who served the king as a
conseil d’etat or Council of State. The Parle- ment of Paris, which took
form under Louis IX, was not a representative assembly, but a group of
some ninety-four lawyers and clerics apppointed by the king, and meeting
once or twice a year to serve as a supreme court. Its ordonnances built
up a body of national law based upon Roman rather than Frank codes, and
giving the monarchy the full support of the classical legal
tradition.</p>
<p>The intellectual excitement of the age of Philip IV is preserved for
us in the political treatises of one of his supporters — Pierre Dubois
(1255-1312), a lawyer who represented Coutances in the States-General of
1302. In a Supplication du peuple de France au roi contre le pape
Boniface (1304) — An Appeal of the People of France to the King against
Pope Boniface — and in a tract On the Recovery of the Holy Land (1306),
Dubois threw out suggestions that reveal the sharp division that now
separated the legal from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE 697</p>
<p>the ecclesiastical mind in France. The Church, said Dubois, should be
dis- endowed, should no longer receive financial support from the state;
the French Church should be separated from Rome; the papacy should be
di- vorced from all temporal power; and the authority of the state
should be supreme. Philip should be made emperor of a united Europe,
with Constan- tinople as his capital. An international court should be
set up to adjudicate the quarrels of nations, and an economic boycott
should be declared against any Christian nation that warred upon
another. A school of Oriental studies should be established at Rome.
Women should have the same educational opportunities and political
rights as men. 80</p>
<p>It was the age of the troubadours in Provence, of the trouveres in
the north, of the Chanson de Roland and other chansons de geste, of
Aucassin et Nicolette and the Roman de la Rose , of the first
outstanding French his- torians — Villardhouin and Joinville. In this
period great universities were organized in Paris, Orleans, Angers,
Toulouse, and Montpellier. It began with Roscelin and Abelard, and
culminated in the zenith of the Scholastic philosophy. It was the age of
the Gothic ecstasy — of the majestic cathedrals of St. Denis, Chartres,
Notre Dame, Amiens, and Reims, and of Gothic sculpture in its most
spiritual perfection. Frenchmen were forgivably proud of their country,
their capital, and their culture; a national unifying patri- otism was
replacing the provincialism of the feudal era; already, as in the
Chanson d e Roland, men spoke lovingly of la douce France , “sweet
France.”</p>

<li>Spain: 1096-1285</li>
</ol>
<p>The Christian reconquest of Spain proceeded as rapidly as the
fraternal chaos of the Spanish kings would permit. The popes gave the
name and privileges of crusaders to Christians who would help drive back
the Moors in Spain; some Templars came from France to help the cause;
and three Spanish military religious orders — the Knights of Calatrava,
of Santiago, of Alcantara — were formed in the twelfth century. In 1 1
18 Alfonso I of Ara- gon captured Saragossa; in 1195 the Christians were
defeated at Alarcos; but in 1212 they almost wiped out the main Almohad
army at Las Navas de Tolosa. The victory was decisive; Moorish
resistance broke down, and one by one the Moslem citadels fell: Cordova
(1236), Valencia (1238), Seville (1248), Cadiz (1250). Thereafter the
reconquista halted for two centuries, to allow time for the wars of the
kings.</p>
<p>When Alfonso VIII of Castile was defeated at Alarcos the kings of
Leon and Navarre, who had promised to go to his help, invaded his
kingdom, and Alfonso had to make peace with the infidels to protect
himself against the infidelity of the Christians. 87 Fernando III

<p>Castile, pushed the Catholic frontier to Granada, made Seville his
capital, the great mosque his cathedral, the Alcazar his residence; the
Church con- sidered him a bastard at his birth, and made him a saint
after his death. His son Alfonso X (1252-84) was an excellent scholar
and an irresolute king. Attracted by the Moorish learning that he found
in Seville, Alfonso el Sabio, the Wise, braved the bigots by hiring Arab
and Jewish, as well as Chris- tian, scholars to translate Moslem works
into Latin for the instruction of Europe. He established a school of
astronomy, whose “Alfonsine Tables” of heavenly bodies and movements
became standard for Christian astronomers. He organized a corps of
historians who wrote under his name a history of Spain and a vast and
general history of the world. He composed some 450 poems, some in
Castilian, some in Galician-Portuguese; many were set to music, and
survive as one of the most substantial monuments of medieval song. His
literary passion overflowed in books written or commissioned by him on
draughts, chess, dice, stones, music, navigation, alchemy, and philoso-
phy. Apparently he ordered a translation of the Bible to be made
directly from the Hebrew into Castilian. With him the Castilian language
assumed the pre-eminence from which it has since ruled the literary life
of Spain. He was in effect the founder of Spanish and Portuguese
literature, of Spanish histo- riography, of Spanish scientific
terminology. He tarnished a brilliant career by intriguing to secure the
throne of the Holy Roman Empire; he spent much Spanish treasure in the
attempt; he sought to replenish his coffers by raising taxes and
debasing the coinage; he was deposed in favor of his son, survived his
downfall by two years, and died a broken man.</p>
<p>Aragon rose to prominence through the marriage of its Queen
Petronilla to Count Ramon Berenguer of Barcelona (1137); Aragon thereby
acquired Catalonia, including the greatest of Spanish ports. Pedro II
(1196-1213) brought the new kingdom to prosperity by protecting with
vigorously en- forced law the security of harbors, markets, and roads;
he made his court at Barcelona the gay and amorous center of Spanish
chivalry and troubadours, and saved his soul — and insured his title —
by presenting Aragon to Innocent III as a feudal fief. His son Jaime or
James I ( 1 2 1 3-76) was five when Pedro died in battle; the Aragonese
nobles seized the opportunity to renew their feudal independence; but
James took the reins at ten, and soon brought the nobles under royal
discipline. Still a youth of twenty, he captured the com- mercially
strategic Balearic Islands from the Moors ( 1229-35), and regained from
them Valencia and Alicante. In 1265, in a chivalric gesture of Spanish
unity, he conquered Murcia from the Moors and presented it to the king
of Castile. Wiser than Alfonso the Wise, he made himself the most power-
ful Spanish monarch of his century, the rival of Frederick II and Louis
IX. His shrewd intelligence and unscrupulous courage likened him to
Frederick; but his loose morality, his many divorces, his ruthless wars
and occasional brutality discourage comparison with St. Louis. He
conspired to seize south-</p>

<p>western France, but the patient Louis outplayed him, though yielding
to him Montpellier. In his old age James plotted to conquer Sicily as a
bastion of strategy and a haven of commerce, and to make the western
Mediterra- nean a Spanish sea; but the realization of this dream was
left to his son. Pedro III (1276- 85) married a daughter of Frederick’s
son Manfred, King of</p>
<p>Sicily, and felt entitled to that island when Charles of Anjou seized
it with the blessing of the pope. Pedro renounced the papal suzerainty
over Aragon, accepted excommunication, and sailed off to fight for
Sicily.</p>
<p>As in England and France, this period saw in Spain both the rise and
the decline of feudalism. The nobles began by almost ignoring the
central power; they and the clergy were exempt from taxation, which fell
the more heavily upon cities and trade; but they ended by submitting to
kings armed with tbeir own troops, supported by the revenues and militia
of the towns, and endowed with the prestige of a reviving Roman law that
assumed absolute monarchy as an axiom of government. At the beginning of
the period there was no Spanish law; there were separate law codes for
each state, and for each class in each state. Fernando III began,
Alfonso X completed, a new system of Castilian law, which from its seven
divisions came to be known as the Siete Partidas, or (Laws of) the Seven
Parts (1260-5) — one of the most complete and important codes in legal
history. Based on the laws of the Spanish Visigoths, but remodeled to
accord with Justinian’s Institutes, the Siete Partidas proved too
advanced for their age; for seventy years they were largely ignored; but
in 1 3 38 they became the actual law of Castile, and in 1492 of all
Spain. A like code was introduced into Aragon by James I. In 1283 Aragon
promulgated an influential code of commercial and maritime law, and
established at Valencia, and later at Barcelona and in Majorca, courts
of the Consulate of the Sea.</p>
<p>Spain led the medieval world in developing free cities and
representative institutions. Seeking the support of the cities against
the nobles, the kings gave charters of self-government to many towns.
Municipal independence became a passion in Spain; little towns demanded
their liberty from larger ones, or from the nobles, the Church, the
king; when they succeeded they raised their own gallows in the market
place as a symbol of their freedom. Barcelona in 1258 was ruled by a
council of 200 members, of whom a ma- jority represented industry or
trade. 88 For a time the towns were sovereign to the point of
independently waging wars against the Moors or one another. But also
they formed hermandades — brotherhoods — for mutual action or se-
curity. In 1 295, when the nobles tried to subdue the communes,
thirty-four towns formed the Herwandad de Castilla, pledged themselves
to a common defense, and raised a joint army. This Brotherhood, having
overcome the nobles, supervised and checked the officials of the king,
and passed laws for the common observance of the member towns, which
sometimes numbered a hundred.</p>

<p>It had long been the custom of Spanish kings to call, on occasion, an
as- sembly of nobles and clergy; one such gathering, meeting in 1137,
received for the first time the name Cortes, courts. In 1188, at the
Cortes of Leon, businessmen from the towns were included — probably the
earliest instance of representative political institutions in Christian
Europe. In this historic congress the king promised not to make war or
peace, or issue any decree, without the consent of the Cortes. 89 In
Castile the first such Cortes of nobles, clergy, and bourgeoisie met in
1250 — forty- five years before the “Model Parliament” of E dward I. The
Cortes did not directly legislate, but it formu- lated “petitions” to
the king; and its power of the purse often persuaded his assent. A
decree of the Cortes of Catalonia in 1283, accepted by the king of
Aragon, ruled that thereafter no national legislation should be issued
without the consent of the citizens ( elves ) ; another provision
required the king to summon the Cortes annually; these enactments
anticipated by over a quarter of a century similar pronouncements (1311,
1322) of the English Parlia- ment. Furthermore, the Cortes appointed
members from each social class to a Junta, or Union, to keep watch, in
the intervals between the sessions of the Cortes, over the
administration of the laws and funds that it had voted. 90 The problem
of government in Spain was complicated by divisive moun- tains impeding
the wide enforcement of a common law. The uneven ter- rain, the dry
plateaus, and the periodic devastations of war discouraged agriculture,
and made Spain largely a grazing land for cattle and sheep. The fine
sheep herds fed thousands of looms in the towns, and Spain maintained
its ancient high reputation for the quality of its wool. Internal trade
was har- assed by difficulties of transport and diversities of weights,
measures, and currencies; but foreign trade grew in the ports of
Barcelona, Tarragona, Va- lencia, Seville, and Cadiz; Catalan merchants
were everywhere; and in 1282 the merchants of Castile held a position in
Bruges rivaled only by the Hanse- atic League. 91 Merchants and
manufacturers became the chief financial sup- port of the crown. The
urban proletariat organized itself into guilds</p>
<p>(gremios) , but these were strictly controlled by the kings, and the
working classes suffered economic exploitation without political
representation.</p>
<p>Most of the industrial workers were either Jews or Mudejares —
Moslems in Christian Spain. The Jews prospered in Aragon and Castile;
they shared actively in the intellectual life of the two kingdoms; many
of them were rich merchants; but at the end of this period they were
subjected to increas- ing restrictions. The Mudejares were allowed
freedom of worship, and con- siderable self-government; they too
included many rich merchants; and a few found entry to the royal courts.
Their craftsmen strongly influenced Spanish architecture, woodwork, and
metalwork to the Mudejar style — the use of Moorish forms and themes in
Christian art. Alfonso VI, in a catholic moment, called himself
Emperador de los Dos Cultos — Emperor of the Two Faiths. 92 But the
Mudejares in general had to wear a distinctive garb, live in</p>
<p>THE RECOVERY OF EUROPE</p>

<p>701</p>
<p>a separate section of each city, and bear especially heavy taxation.
Ultimately the wealth aggregated by their industrial and commercial
skill excited the envy of the majority race; in 1247 James I ordered
their expulsion from Aragon; over 100,000 of them left, taking their
technical skills with them; and Aragonese industry thereafter
declined.</p>
<p>The partial absorption of Moslem culture into Spanish civilization,
the stimulus of victory over an ancient enemy, the growth of industry
and wealth, and of manners and tastes, stirred the mental life of Spain.
The thir- teenth century saw the establishment of six universities in
Spain. Alfonso II of Aragon ( 1 1 62-96) was the first Spanish
troubadour; soon there were hun- dreds; and they not only wrote poetry,
they developed the ceremonies of the Church into secular plays, opening
a path to the triumphs of Lope de Vega and Calderon. To this period
belongs the Cid , the national epic of Spain. Better than all these were
the music, songs, and dances that flowed from the hearts of the people
in their homes and streets, and graduated into the splendor and
pageantry of the royal courts. The first recorded bullfight in the
modern style was given at Avila in 1107 to adorn a wedding feast; by 1
300 it was a common sport in the cities of Spain. At the same time the
French knights who came to help against the Moors brought the ideas and
tourna- ments of chivalry. Respect for women, or for a man’s exclusive
property in a woman, was made a point of honor as vital as a man’s pride
in his courage and integrity; the duel of honor became a part of Spanish
life. The mixture of European and Afro-Semitic blood, of Occidental and
Oriental culture, of Syrian and Persian motives with Gothic art, of
Roman hardness with Eastern sentiment, generated the Spanish character,
and made Spanish civilization, in the thirteenth century, a unique and
colorful element in the European scene.</p>

<p>In the year 1095 Count Henry of Burgundy, a crusading knight in
Spain, so pleased Alfonso VI of Castile and Leon that the King gave him
a daughter, Theresa, in marriage, and included in her dowry, as a fief,
a county of Leon named Portugal.* The territory had been won from Moslem
Spain only thirty-one years before; and south of the Mondego River the
Moors still ruled. Count Henry felt uncomfortable as anything less than
a king; from their marriage he and his wife plotted to make their fief
an independent state. When Henry died (1112), Theresa continued to labor
for independence. She taught her riobles and vassals to think in terms
of national liberty; she encouraged her cities to fortify themselves and
study the arts of war. She led her soldiers in person on campaign after
campaign, and between wars she surrounded herself with musicians, poets,
and lovers. 93 She was defeated,</p>

<p>captured, released, and restored to her fief; she lavished funds upon
an illicit love, was deposed, went into exile with her lover, and died
in poverty (1130).</p>
<p>It was through her inspiration and preparations that her son, Affonso
I Henriques (1128-85), achieved her aims. Alfonso VII of Castile
promised to recognize him as sovereign ruler of any land that he might
conquer from the Moors below the Douro River. With all the reckless
bravery of his father and the spirit and pertinacity of his mother,
Affonso Henriques attacked the Moors, defeated them at Ourique (1139),
and proclaimed himself King of Portugal. The hierarchy persuaded the two
kings to submit the matter to Pope Innocent II, who decided in favor of
Castile. Affonso Henriques re- versed this decision by offering his new
kingdom to the papacy as a fief. Alexander III accepted it, and
recognized him as King of Portugal ( 1 143) on condition of annual
tribute to the See of Rome. 94 Affonso Henriques re- sumed his wars with
the Moors, captured Santarem and Lisbon, and extended his rule to the
Tagus. Under Affonso III ( 1 248-79) Portugal reached its present
mainland limits, and Lisbon, strategically placed at the mouth of the
Tagus, became its port and capital (1263). An old legend said that
Ulysses- Odysseus had founded the city and given it its ancient name
Ulyssipo, which the carelessness of tongues transformed into Olisipo and
Lisboa.</p>
<p>The last years of Affonso II were embittered by civil war with his
son Diniz, who wondered why his father took so long to die. From this
dubious beginning Diniz moved into a long and beneficent reign
(1279-1325). Peace with Leon and Castile was achieved by a marital
alliance; strife with another heir to the throne was averted by the
mediation of Isabel, Diniz’ saintly queen. Renouncing the glories of
war, Diniz devoted himself to the eco- nomic and cultural development of
his kingdom. He founded schools of ag- riculture, taught his people
improved methods of husbandry, planted trees to check erosion, helped
commerce, built ships and cities, organized a Portu- guese navy, and
negotiated a commercial treaty with England; so he earned the title
fondly given him by his subjects — Re Lavrador , the Worker King. He was
an industrious administrator, and a just judge. He supported poets and
scholars, and himself wrote the best poetry of his nation and time;
through him Portuguese ceased to be a Galician dialect and became a lit-
erary language. In his pastorellas he gave literary form to the songs of
the people; and at his court troubadours were encouraged to sing the
joys and pains of love. Diniz himself was a connoisseur in women, and
preferred his bastards to his one legitimate son. When this son rebelled
and raised an army to unseat his father, St. Isabel, who had lived apart
from the merry court of the King, rode between the hostile forces,
proposed to be the first victim of their violence, and shamed her
husband and her son to peace</p>
