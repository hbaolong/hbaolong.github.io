<p>Hellenism and the Orient</p>
<p>I. THE SELEUCID EMPIRE</p>
<p>AS we move from the mainland through the Aegean into the Greek set-
XX dements in Asia and Egypt we are surprised to find a fresh and flour-
ishing life, and we perceive that the Hellenistic age saw not so much
the decay as the dissemination of Greek civilization. From the end of
the Peloponnesian War a stream of Greek soldiers and immigrants had
entered Asia. Alexander’s conquests widened this stream by offering new
oppor - tunities and avenues to Hellenic enterprise.</p>
<p>Seleucus, called “Nicator” (Victor), was distinguished among
Alexander’s generals as a man of courage, imagination, and unscrupulous
generosity. It was characteristic of him that he gave his second wife,
the beautiful Stratonice, to his son Demetrius when he learned that the
boy was pining away for love of her. Antigonus I, challenging the
allotment of Babylonia to Seleucus, set out to con- quer for himself all
the Near East; Seleucus and Ptolemy I defeated him at Gaza in 3 12. From
that moment the house of Seleucus dated the Seleucid Empire, and a new
era — a mode of reckoning that survived in western Asia till Mohammed.
Seleucus united under his scepter the old kingdoms and cultures of Elam,
Sumeria, Persia, Babylonia, Assyria, Syria, Phoenicia, and, at times,
Asia Minor and Palestine. At Seleucia and Antioch he built capitals
richer and more popu- lous than any ever known in mainland Greece. For
Seleucia he chose a site near the aged Babylon and the future Baghdad,
almost at the junction of the Eu- phrates and the Tigris; it was
conveniently located to attract commerce between Mesopotamia and the
Persian Gulf and beyond; within half a century it had a population of
600,000 souls — a motley mass of Asiatics dominated by a minority of
Greeks.* Antioch was similarly situated on the Orontes, not too far from
its mouth to be reached by ocean shipping, yet sufficiently inland to be
safe from naval attack, to tap the fertile fields of the river valley^
and to draw the Mediter- ranean trade of northern Mesopotamia and Syria.
Here the later Seleucid em- perors established their residence, until
under Antiochus IV it became the wealthiest city of Seleucid Asia,
adorned with temples, porticoes, theaters, gym-</p>
<ul>
<li>On this site Professor Leroy Waterman in 1931 exhumed tablets
indicating that one of the richest citizens of Seleucia had avoided the
payment of taxes for cwenty-hve years.^</li>

<p>nasiums, palaestxas, flower gardens, landscaped boulevards, and parks
so beauti- ful that the Garden of Daphne was known throughout Greece for
its laurels and cypresses, its fountains and streams.</p>
<p>Seleucus I was assassinated in 281, after thirty-five years of
beneficent and popular rule. From his death his empire began to
disintegrate, tom with geo- graphical and racial divisions, violent
struggles for the throne, and barbarian invasions on every side.
Antiochus I Soter (Savior) fought gallantly against the Gauls. Antiochus
II Theos (the God) lived in a perpetual intoxication, as if again to
illustrate the gamble of hereditary monarchy; his wife Laodice began
that chain of intrigue which disrupted and finally ruined the royal
house. Antiochus III the Great was a man of capacity and culture; his
bust in the Louvre shows a Greco-Macedonian with the courage of Macedon
and the intelligence of Greece. He recaptured by untiring war most of
the territory which the empire had lost since Seleucus I. He established
a library at Antioch, and promoted the literary movement that culminated
in Meleager of Gaza at the close of the second century. He preserved the
Greek custom of municipal autonomy, writ- ing to the cities that “if he
should order anything contrary to the laws they should pay no attention,
but assume that he had acted in ignorance.”* He was ruined by ambition,
imagination, and a flair for love. In 2 17 he was defeated by Ptolemy IV
at Raphia, and lost Phoenicia, Syria, and Palestine; he consoled him-
self by a victorious expedition into Bactria and India (208),
duplicating the ex- ploits of Alexander. Lured by Hannibal into helping
him against Rome, he landed an army in Euboea, fell in love at fifty
with a pretty maid of Chalcis, courted her honorably, married her
elaborately, forgot the war, and spent the winter enjoying his
happiness.* The Romans defeated him at Thermopylae, drove him into Asia
Minor, and overwhelmed him at Magnesia. Restless, he plunged into
another eastern campaign, and died in its course (187), after a reign of
thirty-six years.</p>
<p>His son Seleucus IV loved peace, administered the empire with economy
and wisdom, and was assassinated in 175. At that time his younger
brother was serv- ing as archon at Athens, where he had gone to study
philosophy. Hearing of Seleucus’ death, he organized an army, marched to
Antioch, deposed the a ssassin, and took the throne (175). Antiochus IV
was both the most interesting and the most erratic of his line, a rare
mixture of intellect, insanity, and charm. He governed his kingdom ably
despite a thousand injustices and absurdities. He allowed his delegates
to abuse their power, and gave his mistress authority over three cities.
He was generous and cruel without judgment, often forgiving or
condemning by whim, surprising simple folk with costly gifts, and
tossing money with a child’s ecstasy am ong the crowds in the street. He
loved wine, women, and art; he drank to excess, and left his royal seat,
at banquets, to dance naked with the entertainers, or to carouse with
wastrels;* he was a Bohemian</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>whose dream of power had come true. He despised the solemnity and
trappings of the court, played practical jokes upon his dignitaries, and
disguised himself to know the luxury of anonymity; it delighted him to
mingle with the people and overhear their comments on the King. He liked
to wander among the shops of the artisans, watching and studying the
work of engravers and jewelers, and dis - cussing with them the technicd
details of their craft. He felt a sincere enthusi - asm for Greek art,
literature, and thought. He made Antioch for a century the art center of
the Greek world; he paid artists handsomely to set up statuary and
temples in other cities of Hellas; he redecorated the shrine of Apollo
at Delos, built a theater for Tegea, and financed the completion of the
Olympieum at Athens. Having lived fourteen impressionable years in Rome,
he had imbibed a taste for republican institutions; and as if to
foreshadow Augustus, it pleased iiis humor and policy to clothe his
monarchical power in the forms of republican freedom. The chief effect
of his passion for things Roman was the introduction of gladiatorial
games in Antioch, his capital. The people resented the brutal sport, but
Antiochus won them over by lavish and spectacular displays; when they
became accustomed to the butchery he considered their degeneration a
personal victory. It was characteristic of him that he began as an
ardent follower of the Stoics, and ended as an easy convert to the
Epicureans. He enjoyed his own qualities so keenly that he labeled his
coins Antiochus Theos Epiphanes — the God Made Manifest. Overreaching
himself in the manner of his imagina- tive kind, he attempted in 169 to
conquer Egypt. He was succeeding when Rome, herself a candidate for the
Egyptian plum, ordered him to retire from African soil. Antiochus asked
time to consider; but the Roman envoy, Popilius, drew a circle in the
sand around Antiochus, and bade him decide before stepping over its
line. Antiochus yielded in fury, plundered the Temple at Jerusalem to
restore his treasury, sought glory like his father in a campaign against
the eastern tribes, and died in Persia on the way, of epilepsy, madness,
or disease.*</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>SELEUCID CIVILIZATION</li>
</ol>
<p>The function of the Seleucid Empire in history was to give to the
Near East that economic protection and order which Persia had provided
before Alex- ander, and which Rome would restore after Caesar. Despite
the wars, revolu- tions, spoliations, and corruption normal to human
affairs, that function was performed. The Macedonian conquest broke down
a thousand barriers of gov- ernment and speech, and invited the East and
the West to fuller economic exchange. The result was a brilliant
resurrection of Greek Asia. While division and strife, the poverty of
the soil, and the migrations of trade routes ruined the mainland, the
comparative unity and peace preserved by the Seleucids encour- aged
agriculture, commerce, and industry. The Greek cities of Asia were
no</p>
<p>HELLENISM AND THE ORIENT</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>longer free to make revolutions or experiments; homonoia^ Harmony,
was en- forced by the kings, and was literally worshiped by the people
as a god.® Old cities like Miletus, Ephesus, and Smyrna had a second
blooming.</p>
<p>The valleys of the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Jordan, the Orontes,
the Maean- der, the Halys, and the Oxus were fertile then beyond the
conception of present imagination, obsessed with the vision of the
deserts and rocky wastes that cover so much of the Near East after two
thousand years of erosion, deforestation, and neglectful tenant
tillage.^ The soil was irrigated by a system of canals main- tained
under the supervision of the state. The land was owned by the king, or
his nobles, or the cities, or the temples, or private individuals; in
all cases the labor was performed by serfs transmitted with the soil in
bequest or sale. The govern- ment considered as national property all
the riches contained in the earth,® but did little to exploit them.
Trades, and even cities, were now highly specialized. Miletus was a busy
textile center; Antioch imported raw materials and turned them into
finished goods. Some large factories, manned with slaves, achieved a
modest degree of mass production for the general market.® But domestic
con- sumption lagged behind production; the people were so poor that no
adequate home market encouraged large-scale industry.</p>
<p>Commerce was the life of Hellenistic economy. It made the great
fortunes, built the great cities, and employed a growing proportion of
the expanding population. Money transactions now almost completely
replaced the barter that had survived for four centuries the coinage of
Croesus. Egypt, Rhodes, Seleucia, Pergamum, and other governments issued
currencies sufficiently stable and similar to facilitate international
trade. Bankers provided public and private credit. Ships were larger,
made four to six knots per hour, and shortened voyages by crossing the
open sea. On land the Seleucids developed and extended the great
highways le ft as part of Persia’s legacy to the East. Caravan routes
con - verged from inner Asia upon Seleucia, and opened out thence to
Damascus, Berytus (Beirut), and Antioch. Enriched by trade, and
enriching it in turn, populous centers rose there and at Babylon, Tyre,
Tarsus, Xanthus, Rhodes, Halicarnassus, Miletus, Ephesus, Smyrna,
Pergamum, Byzantium, Cyzicus, Apamea, Heracleia, Amisus, Sinope,
Panticapaeum, Olbia, Lysimacheia, Abydos, Thessalonica (Salonika),
Chalcis, Delos, Corinth, Ambracia, Epidamnus (Duraz- zo), Taras,
Neapolis (Naples), Rome, Massalia, Emporium, Panormus (Paler- mo),
Syracuse, Utica, Carthage, Cyrene, and Alexandria. One busy web of trade
bound together Spain under Carthage and Rome, Carthage under Hamil- car,
Syracuse under Hieron II, Rome under the Scipios, Macedonia under the
Antigonids, Greece under the Leagues, Egypt under the Ptolemies, the
Near East under the Seleucids, India under the Mauryas, and China under
the Hans. The routes from China passed through Turkestan, Bactria, and
Persia, or over the Aral, Caspian, and Black Seas. The routes from India
passed through Af-</p>
<p>576 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>ghanistan and Persia to Seleucia, or through Arabia and Petra to
Jerusalem and Damascus, or across the Indian Ocean to Adana (Aden), then
through the Red Sea to Arsinoe (Suez), and thence to Alexandria. It was
for control of the last two routes that the Seleucid and Ptolemaic
dynasties fought those “Syrian Wars” that finally weakened them both to
the point of fall ing vassal to Rome.</p>
<p>The Seleucid monarchy, inheriting the Asiatic tradition, was
absolute; no assembly limited its power. The court was planned on the
Oriental style, with chamberlains and lace, eunuchs and uniforms,
incense and music; only the speech and the inner dress remained Greek.
The nobles were not half-inde- pendent chieftains as in Macedonia or
medieval Europe, but administrative or military appointees of the king.
It was this structure of monarchy that passed down from Persia through
the Seleucids and Sassanids to the Rome of Diocletian and the Byzantium
of Constantine. Knowing that their power, in an alien scene, rested upon
the loyalty of the Greek population, the Seleucid kings labored to
restore Ae old Greek cities and to establish new ones. Seleucus I
founded nine Seleucias, six Antiochs, five Laodiceas, three Apameas, one
Stratonice; and his successors imitated him to the best of their lesser
ability. Cities grew and multi - plied as in nineteenth-century
America.</p>
<p>Through them the Hellenization of western Asia proceeded, on the sur-
face, at a rapid pace. The process, of course, was old; it had begun
with the Great Migration, and the Hellenistic Dispersion was in part the
Renaissance of Ionia, a return of Greek civilization to its early
Asiatic homes. Even before Alexander Greeks had held high offices in the
Persian Empire, and Greek merchants had dominated the trade routes of
the nearer East. Now the opening of political, commercial, and artistic
opportunities drew from old Greece, Magna Graecia, and Sicily an
emigrant flow of adventurers, settlers, scribes, soldiers, traders,
doctors, scholars, and courtesans. Greek sculptors and engravers made
statues and coins for Phoenician, Lycian, Carian, Cilician, Bactrian
kings. Greek dancing girls became the rage of Asiatic ports.” Sexual
immorality took on a Greek grace, and Greek pa - laestras and gymnasiums
aroused in some Orientals an unwonted devotion to athletics and baths.
Cities secured new water supplies and drainage sys- tems; avenues were
paved and cleaned. Schools, libraries, and theaters stimulated reading
and literature; collegians (epheboi) and university stu- dents roamed
the streets and played their ancient pranks upon one another and the
populace. No one was counted cultured unless he understood Greek and
could enjoy the plays of Menander and Euripides. This imposi- tion of
Greek civilization upon the Near East is one of the startling phe-
nomena of ancient history; no change so swift and far-reaching had
ever</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) HELLENISM AND THE ORIENT 577</p>
<p>been seen in Asia. We know too little of its details and its results.
We are poorly informed about the literature, philosophy, and science of
Seleucid Asia; if we find in it few figures of prime magnitude — Zeno
the Stoic, Seleu- cus the astronomer, and, in the Roman period, Meleager
the poet and Poseidippus the polymath — we cannot be sure that there
were not many more. It was a flourishing culture, full of variety,
refinement, and verve, and as fertile in art as any preceding age. Never
before, so far as our knowl- edge goes, had a civilization achieved so
wide a spread and such complex unity amid so many diverse environments.
For a century western Asia belonged to Europe. The way was prepared for
the Pax Romana, and the embracing synthesis of Christendom.</p>
<p>But the East was not conquered. It was too deeply and anciently
itself to yield its soul. The masses of the people continued to speak
their native tongues, to pursue their long-accustomed ways, and to
worship their ances- tral gods. Beyond the Mediterranean coasts the
Greek veneer grew thin, and such Hellenic centers as Seleucia on the
Tigris were Greek islands in an Oriental sea. There was no such fusion
of races and cultures as Alex- ander had dreamed of; there were Greeks
and Greek civilization on the top, and a medley of Asiatic peoples and
cultures underneath. The quali- ties of the Greek intellect made no
entry into the Oriental mind; the energy and love of novelty, the zest
for worldliness and the passion for perfection, the expressiveness and
individualism of the Greek effected no change in the Oriental character.
On the contrary, as time moved on. Eastern ways of thought and feeling
surged up from below into the ruling Greeks, and through them flowed
westward to transform the “pagan” world. In Baby - lon the patient
Semitic merchant and the temple banker regained ascend- ancy over the
volatile Hellene, preserved the cuneiform writing, and forced back the
Greek language into second place in the business world. Astrol- ogy and
alchemy corrupted Greek astronomy and physics; Oriental mon- archy
proved more powerful than Greek democracy, and finally im-</p>
<p>pressed its form upon the West; Greek kings and Roman emperors became
gods in the manner of the East, and the Asiatic theory of the divine
right of kings passed down through Rome and Constantinople into modem
Europe. Through Zeno the East insinuated its quietism and fatalism into
Greek philosophy; through a hundred channels it poured its mysticism and
its piety into the vacuum left by the decay of the orthodox Greek faith.
The Greek readily accepted the gods of the Orient as essentially
identical with his own; but as the Greek did not really believe, and the
Asiatic did, the Oriental god survived while the Greek god died. Artemis
of the Ephe- THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>sians became again an Eastern maternity goddess, with a dozen
breasts. Babylonian, Phoenician, and Syrian cults captured great numbers
of the invading Hellenes. The Greeks offered the East philosophy, the
East of- fered Greece religion; religion won because philosophy was a
luxury for the few, religion was a consolation for the many. In the
rhythmic historic alternation of belief and unbelief, mysticism and
naturalism, religion and science, religion returned to power because it
recognized the secret help- lessness and loneliness of man, and gave him
inspiration and poetry; a dis- illusioned, exploited, war-wearied world
was glad to believe and hope again. The least expected and most profound
effect of Alexander’s conquest was the Orientalization of the European
soul.</p>
<p>in. PERGAMUM</p>
<p>The gradual absorption of the Greeks by Asia weakened the Seleucid
power, and generated independent kingdoms on the edge of the Hellen-
istic world. As early as 280 Armenia, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Bithynia
set up their own monarchies; and soon the Greek cities of the Black Sea
fell subject to Asiatic rule. Bactria and Sogdiana broke away about 250.
In 247 Arsaces, chief of the Pami — an Iranian nomad tribe — killed the
Seleucid governor of Persia and set up the kingdom of Parthia, destined
to plague Rome for centuries. In 282 Philataerus, entrusted by
Lysimachus with the care of nine thousand talents and the fortified hill
of Pergamum in Asia Minor, appropriated the money and declared his
independence. His nephew Eumenes I absorbed Pitane and Atarneus, and
made Pergamum a sovereign monarchy (262). Attains I earned the gratitude
of Greek Asia by driving back the Gauls who had penetrated to his city
walls (230); his eldest son, Eumenes II, continued his competent rule,
but shocked Greece by calling in the aid of Rome against Antiochus III.
After their defeat of Antiochus at Magnesia the Romans gave Eumenes
nearly all of Asia Minor. His brother and successor. Attains II,
distrusted the power of his sons to keep Pergamum free, and at his death
( 1 39) bequeathed his kingdom to Rome.</p>
<p>The little state did what it could to redeem the treachery of its
birth and growth by making itself the rival of Alexandria as a center of
art and learning. The wealth that came from the mines, vines, and
cornfields, from the manufacture of woolens, parchments, and perfumes,
from the making of bricks and tiles, and the mastery of north Aegean
trade went not only to mai n tain a strong army and navy, but to
encourage literature and art. The Pergamene kings believed that
government and private business could</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) HELLENISM AND THE ORIENT 579</p>
<p>fruitfully compete, supplying a mutual check on inefficiency and
greed. The king cultivated large tracts of land with slaves, and
operated, though not as monopolies, many factories, quarries, and mines.
Under this unique system wealth increased and multiplied. Pergamum
became an ornate capi- tal, famous for its altar to Zeus, its luxurious
palaces, its library and theater, its palaestras and baths; even its
public lavatories upheld the municipal pride.“ The library was second
only to Alexandria’s in the numbe r of its volumes and the repute of its
scholars; and the pinakotheka housed, for the public enjoyment, a great
collection of paintings. For half a century Pergamum was the finest
flower of Hellenic civilization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the House of Seleucus had fallen into decay. The rise
of</p>
<p>independent kingdoms almost confined its power to Mesopotamia and
Syria. Parthia, Pergamum, Egypt, and Rome patiently labored to weaken
the dynasty by supporting pretenders at every succession, and fomenting
faction and civil war. In 153, just as Demetrius I was restoring vigor
to the Seleucid government, Rome collected mercenaries from every
quarter to bolster up the false claims of a Smymean adventurer to the
throne. Pergamum and Egypt joined in the attack; Demetrius fought and
died heroically, and the Seleucid power fell into the hands of the
worthless Alexander Balas, the puppet of his mistresses and of Rome.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>HELLENISM AND THE JEWS</li>
</ol>
<p>The history of Judea in the Hellenistic age turns on two conflicts:
the external struggle between Seleucid Asia and Ptolemaic Egypt for
Palestine, and the internal struggle between the Hellenic and the
Hebraic ways of life. The first conflict is dead history, and may be
briefly dismissed; Matthew Arnold believed the second conflict to be one
of the lasting cleavages of human feeling and thought. In the original
division of Alexander’s empire Judea (i.e., Palestine south of Samaria)
had been awarded to Ptolemy. The Seleucids never accepted this decision;
they saw themselves separated from the Mediterranean, and coveted the
wealth that might come from the trade that passed through Damascus and
Jerusalem. In the resultant wars Ptolemy I won, and Judea remained
subject to the Ptolemies for more than a century (312-198). It paid an
annual tribute of eight thousand tal- ents, but despite this burden the
land prospered. Judea was left a large measure of self-government under
the hereditary high priest of Jerusalem and the Great Assembly. This

<p>580 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>and Nehemiah had formed two centuries back, became both a senate and
a supreme court. Its seventy or more members were chosen from the heads
of the leading families, and from the most learned scholars {Soferim) of
the land. Its regulations — the Dibre Soferim — set the pattern of
orthodox Juda- ism from the Hellenistic age to our own.</p>
<p>The basis of Judaism was religion: the idea of a surveillant and
uphold- ing deity entered into every phase and moment of Jewish life.
Morals and manners were ordained by the gerousia in strictness and
detail. Entertain- ments and games were few and restrained.
Intermarriage with non-Jews was forbidden; so were celibacy and
infanticide. Hence the Jews bred abundantly, and reared all their
children; despite war and famine their numbers grew throughout
antiquity, until in the time of Caesar there were some seven million
Jews in the Roman Empire. The bulk of the popula- tion, before the
Maccabean era, was agricultural. The Jews were not yet a nation of
traders; even as late as the first century a.d. Josephus wrote: “We are
not a commercial people” ;“ the great trading peoples of the age were
the Phoenicians, the Arabs, and the Greeks. Slavery existed in Judea as
elsewhere, but the class war was relatively mild. Art was undeveloped;
only music flourished. The flute, the drum, the cymbal, the “ram’s horn”
or trumpet, the lyre, and the harp were used to accompany the single
voice, the folk song, or the solemn religious antiphons. Jewish religion
scorned the concessions of Greek ritual to popular imagination; it would
have nothing to do with images, oracles, or birds’ entrails; it was less
anthropomorphic and superstitious, less colorful and joyful, than the
religion of the Greeks. Face to face with the naive polytheism of
Hellenic cults, the rabbis chanted the sonorous refrain still heard in
every Jewish synagogue: Shammed Israel, Adonai eleenu, Adonai cchod —
“Hear, O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.”</p>
<p>Into this simple and puritan life the invading Greeks brought all
the</p>
<p>distractions and temptations of a refined and epicurean civilization.
Around Judea was a ring of Greek settlements and cities: Samaria,
Neapolis</p>
<p>(Shechem), Gaza, Ascalon, Azotus (Ashdod), Joppa (Jaffa), Apollonia,
Doris, Sycamina, Polis (Haifa), and Acco (Acre). Just across the Jordan
was a leagued decapolis of Greek cities: Damascus, Gadara, Gerasa, Dium,
Philadelphia, Pella, Raphia, Hippo, Scythopolis, and Canetha. Each of
these had Greek institutions and establishments — temples to Greek gods
and goddesses, schools and academies, gymnasiums and palaestras, and
nude games. From such cities, and from Alexandria, Antioch, Delos,
and</p>
<p>Rhodes, Greeks and jews came to Jerusalem, bringing the infection
of</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) HELLENISM AND THE ORIENT 581</p>
<p>a Hellenism devoted to science and philosophy, art and literature,
beauty and pleasure, song and dance, drinking and feasting, athletics
and courte- sans and handsome boys, along with a gay sophistication that
questioned all morals, and an urbane skepticism that undermined all
supernatural be- lief. How could Jewish youth resist these invitations
to delight, this easy liberation from a thousand irksome restraints?
Young wits among the Jews began to laugh at the priests as
moneygrubbers, and at their pious followers as fools who allowed old age
to come upon them without having ever known the pleasures, luxuries, and
subtleties of life. Rich Jews were also won over, for they could afford
to yield to temptation. Jews who sought appointment from Greek officials
felt it the part of policy to speak the Greek language, to live in the
Greek way, even to say a few kind words to the Greek gods.</p>
<p>Against this powerful assault upon both the intellect and the senses
three forces defended the Jews: the persecution under Antiochus IV, the
pro- tection of Rome, and the power and prestige of a Law believed to be
divinely revealed. Like antibodies gathering to attack an infection, the
more religious among the Jews formed themselves into a sect called
Chasidim — the Pious. They began (about 300 b.c.) with a simple pledge
to avoid wine for a given period; later, by the inevitable psychology of
war, they went to the extremes of Puritanism, and frowned upon all
physical pleasure as a surrender to Satan and the Greeks. The Greeks
marveled at them, and classified them with the strange “gymnosophists,”
or nude ascetic philoso - phers, whom Alexander’s army had come upon in
India. Even the common Jew deprecated the severe religiosity of the
Chasidim, and sought for some middle way. Perhaps a compromise would
have been reached had it not been for the attempt of Antiochus Epiphanes
to force Hellenism upon Judea by persuasion of the sword.</p>
<p>In 198 Antiochus III defeated Ptolemy V, and made Judea a part of</p>
<p>the Seleucid Empire. Tired of the Egyptian yoke, the Jews supported
Antiochus, and welcomed his capture of Jerusalem as a liberation. But
his successor, Antiochus IV, thought of Judea as a source of revenue; he
was planning great campaigns, and needed funds. He ordered the Jews to
pay in taxes one third of their grain crops and one half of the fruit of
their trees.” Ignoring the usual inheritance of the office, he appointed
as high priest the sycophantic Jason, who represented the Hellenizing
party in Jerusalem and sought permission to establish Greek institutions
in Judea. Antiochus heard him gladly, for he was disturbed by the
diversity and persistence of Oriental cults in Greek Asia, and dreamed
of unifying his</p>
<p>5^2 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>polyglot empire through one law and one faith. When Jason went about
these matters with insufficient haste Antiochus replaced him with
Menelaus, who gave him larger promises and a fatter bribe.“ Under
Menelaus Yahweh was identified with Zeus, Temple vessels were sold to
raise funds, and in some Jewish communities sacrifices were offered to
Hellenic deities. A gymnasium was opened in Jerusalem, and Jewish
youths, even priests, took part, naked, in athletic games; some young
Jews, in the ardor of their Hel- lenism, underwent operations to remedy
the physiological shortcomings that might reveal their race.”</p>
<p>Shocked by these developments, and feeling their religion challenged
in its very existence, the majority of the Jewish people went over to
the side and view of the Chasidim. When Antiochus IV was expelled from
Egypt by Popilius (i68), the news reached Jerusalem in the form of a
report that he had been killed. The rejoicing Jews deposed his
appointees, massacred the leaders of the Hellenizing party, and cleansed
the Temple of what they felt to be pagan abominations. Antiochus, not
dead but humiliated, money- less, and convinced that the Jews had
obstructed his campaign against Egy pt and were conspiring to return
Judea to the Ptolemies,” marched up to Jerusalem, slaughtered Jews of
either sex by the thousand, desecrated and looted the Temple,
appropriated for the royal coffers its golden altar, its vessels, and
its treasuries, restored Menelaus to supreme power, and gave orders for
the compulsory Hellenization of all Jews (167). He</p>
<p>commanded that the Temple be rededicated as a shrine to Zeus, that a
Greek altar be built over the old one, and that the usual sacrifices be
re- placed with a sacrifice of swine. He forbade the keeping of the
Sabbath or the Jewish festivals, and made circumcision a capital crime.
Throughout Judea the old religion and its rites were interdicted, and
the Greek ritual was made compulsory on pain of death. Every Jew who
refused to eat pork, or who was found possessing the Book of the Law,
was to be jailed dr killed, and the Book wherever found was to be
burned.” Jerusalem itself was put to the flames, its walls were
destroyed, and its Jewish population was sold into slavery. Foreign
peoples were brought in to resettle the site, a new fortress was built
upon Mt. Zion, and a garrison of troops was left in it to rule the city
in the name of the King.” At times, it seems, Antiochus thought of
establi shing and requiring the worship of himself as a god.”</p>
<p>The orgy of persecution became intensified as its proceeded. There is
always, in any society, a minority whose instincts rejoice in the
permission to persecute; it is a release from civilization. The agents
of Antiochus, having put an end to all visible expression of Judaism in
Jerusalem, passed like a searching fire into the towns and villages.
Everywhere they gave</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) HELLENISM AND THE ORIENT 583</p>
<p>the people a choice between death and participation in Hellenic
worship, which included the eating of sacrificial swine.“ All synagogues
and Jew - ish schools were closed. Those who refused to work on the
Sabbath were outlawed as rebels. On the day of the Bacchanalia the Jews
were com- pelled to deck themselves with ivy like the Greeks, to take
part in the processions, and to sing wild songs in honor of Dionysus.
Many Jews conformed to the demands, waiting for the storm to pass. Many
others fled into caves or mountain retreats, lived on clandestine
gleanings from the fields, and resolutely carried on the ordinances of
Jewish life. The Chasidim circulated among them, preaching courage and
resistance. A detachment of royal troops, coming upon some caves in
which thousands of Jews — men, women, and children — were hiding,
ordered them to come forth. The Jews refused; and because it was the
Sabbath, they would not move the stones that might have blocked the
entrance to the caves. The soldiers attacked with fire and sword,
killing many of the refugees and asphyxiating the remainder with smoke.“
Women who had circumcized their newborn sons were cast with their
infants over the city walls to death.“ The Greeks were surprised to find
the strength of the old faith; not for centuries had they seen such
loyalty to an idea. The stories of martyrdom went from mouth to mouth,
filled books like the First and Second Maccabees, and gave to
Christianity the prototypes of its martyrs and its martyrology. Judaism,
which had been near assimilation, became intensified in religious and
national consciousness, and withdrew into a protective isolation.</p>
<p>Among the Jews who in those days fled from Jerusalem were Mattathias
— of the family of Hasmonai, of the tribe of Aaron — and his five sons —
Johannan Caddis, Simon, Judas, Eleazar, and Jonathan. When Apelles, an
agent of Antiochus, came to Modin, where these six had sought refuge, he
summoned the inhabitants to repudiate the Law and sacrifice to Zeus. The
aged Mattathias came forward with his sons an d said: “Even should all
the people in the kingdom obey the order to depart from the faith of
their fathers, I and my sons will abide by the Covenant of our
ancestors.” As one of the Jews approached the altar to make the required
sacrifice Mattathias s lew him, and slew also the King’s commissioner.
Then he said to the people: “Whoever is zealous for the Law, and wishes
to support the Covenant, let him follow me.”“ Many of the villagers
retired with him and his sons to the mountains of Ephraim; and there
they were joined by a small band of young rebels, and by such of the
Chasidim as were still alive.</p>
<p>Soon afterward Mattathias died, having designated as captain of his
band</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>584</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>his son Judas, called Maccabee.* Judas was a warrior whose courage
equaled his piety; before every battle he prayed like a saint, but in
the hour of battle “he was like a lion in his rage.” The little army
“lived in the</p>
<p>mountains after the manner of beasts, feeding on herbs.” Every now
and then it descended upon a neighboring village, killed backsliders,
pulled down pagan altars, and “what children soever they found
uncircumcized, those they circumcized valiantly.”“ These things being
reported to An - tiochus, he sent an army of Syrian Greeks to destroy
the Maccabean force. Judas met them in the pass of Emmaus; and though
the Greeks were trained mercenaries fully armed, and Judas’ band was
poorly armed and clad, the Jews won a complete victory (166). Antiochus
sent a larger force, whose general was so confident that he brought
slave merchants with him to buy the Jews whom he expected to capture,
’and posted in the towns the prices that he would ask.” Judas defeated
these troops at Mizpah, and so decisively that Jerusalem fell into his
hands without resist- ance. He removed all pagan altars and ornaments
from the Temple, cleansed and rededicated it, and restored the ancient
service amid the ac- claim of the returning orthodox Jews (i64).f</p>
<p>As the regent Lysias advanced with a new army to recapture the capi-
tal, the news came — this time true — that Antiochus was dead (163). De-
siring to be free for action elsewhere, Lysias offered the Jews full
religious freedom on condition that they lay down their arms. ’The
Chasidim co n- sented, the Maccabeans refused; Judas announced that
Judea, to be safe from further persecutions, must achieve political as
well as religious lib- erty. Intoxicated with power, the Maccabeans now
took their turn at persecution, pursuing the Hellenizing faction
vengefully not only in</p>
<p>Jerusalem but in the - cities that bordered the frontier.” In 161
Judas de - feated Nicanor at Adasa, and strengthened himself by making
an alliance with Rome; but in the same year, fighting against great odds
at Elasa, he was slain. His brother Jonathan carried on the war bravely,
but was him- self killed at Acco (143). The only surviving brother,
Simon, supported by Rome, won from Demetrius II, in 142, an
acknowledgment of Judean independence. By popular decree Simon was
appointed both high priest and general; and as these offices were made
hereditary in his family, he became the founder of the Hasmonean
dynasty. The first year of his reign was counted as the beginning of a
new era, and an issue of coinage proclaimed the heroic rebirth of the
Jewish state.</p>
