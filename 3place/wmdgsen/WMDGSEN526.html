<h4 id="chapter-viii-rousseau-outcast">CHAPTER VIII Rousseau
Outcast</h4>
<p>1762-67</p>
<p>I. FLIGHT</p>
<p>I T is remarkable that a book containing, as did Emile, so open an
attack upon all but the fundamentals of Christianity should have passed
the censor and been printed in France. But the censor was the tolerant
and sympathetic Malesherbes. Before allowing publication he urged
Rousseau to delete some passages that would almost certainly rouse the
Church to active hostility. Rousseau refused. Other heretics had escaped
personal prosecution by using pseudonyms, but Rousseau bravely stated
his authorship on the title pages of his books.</p>
<p>While the philosophes denounced Emile as further treason to
philosophy, the prelates of France and the magistrates of Paris and
Geneva condemned it as apostasy from Christianity. The anti-Jansenist
Archbishop of Paris pre- pared for August, 1762, a powerful mandemant
against the book. The pro- Jansenist Parlement of Paris was engaged in
expelling the Jesuits; it wished, nevertheless, to display its zeal for
Catholicism; the appearance of ’Emile offered an opportunity to strike a
blow for the Church. The Council of State, at war with the Parlement,
and unwilling to lag behind it in zeal for ortho- doxy, proposed to
arrest Rousseau. Getting wind of this, his aristocratic friends advised
him to leave France at once. On June 8 Mme. de Crequi sent him an
excited message: “It is only too true tha t an order has been issued for
your arrest. In the name of God, go away!… The burning of your book will
do no harm, but your person cannot stand imprisonment. Consult your
neighbors.” 1</p>
<p>The neighbors were the Marechal and Marechale de Luxembourg. They
feared involvement if Rousseau were arrested; 2 they and the Prince de
Conti urged him to flee, and gave him funds and a carriage for the long
ride across France to Switzerland. He yielded reluctantly. He commended
Therese to the Marechale’s care , and left Montmorency on June 9. On
that day a decree was issued for Rousseau’s arrest, but it was executed
with merciful tardiness, for many in the government were glad to let him
escape. On that same day Maitre Omer Joly de Fleury, brandishing a copy
of Emile , told the Parle- ment of Paris</p>
<p>That this work appears to have been composed solely with the aim of
reduc- ing everything to natural religion, and of developing that
criminal system in the author’s plan for the education of his
pupil;…</p>
<p>1 89</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>That he regards all religions as equally good, and as all having
their reasons in the climate, the government, and the character of the
people;…</p>
<p>That in consequence he dares seek to destroy the truth of Sacred
Scripture and the prophecies, the certitude of the miracles described in
the Holy Books, the infallibility of revelation, and the authority of
the Church…. He ridicules and blasphemes the Christian religion, which
alone has God for its author….</p>
<p>The author of this book, who has had the boldness to sign his name to
it, should be arrested as soon as possible. It is important that…
justice should make an example, with all severity, both of the author
and of those who… have shared in printing or distributing such a
work.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Parlement ordered that</p>
<p>he said book shall be torn and burned in the court of the Palace [of
Justice], at the foot of the grand staircase, by the High Executioner;
all those who have copies of the book shall deliver them to the
Register, to be destroyed; no pub- lisher shall print or sell or
distribute this book; all sellers or distributors thereof shall be
arrested and punished according to the rigor of the law;… and J.-J.
Rousseau shall be apprehended and brought to the Conciergerie prison of
the Palace. 3</p>
<p>On June 11 Emile was “torn and burned” as ordered, but by June 11
Rousseau had rea ched Switzerland. “The moment I was in the territory of
Bern I bade the postilion stop; I got out of my carriage, prostrated
myself, kissed the ground, and exclaimed in a transport of joy: ‘Heaven,
protector of virtue, be praised; I touch a land of libe rty!’” 4</p>
<p>He was not quite sure. He drove on to Yverdon, near the south end of
the Lake of Neuchatel, in the canton of Bern; there he stayed for a
month with his old friend Roguin. Should he seek a home in Geneva? But
on June 19 the Council of Twenty-five, ruling Geneva, condemned both
Emile and The Social Contract as</p>
<p>impious, scandalous, bold, full of blasphemies and calumnies against
religion. Under the appearance of doubts the author has assembled
everything that could tend to sap, shake, and destroy the principal
foundations of the revealed Christian religion…. T hese books are so
much the more dangerous and rep- rehensible as they are written in
French [not in esoteric Latin], in the most seductive style, and appear
over the name of “Citizen of Geneva.” 5 Accordingly the Council ordered
both books to be burned, prohibited their sale, and decreed arrest for
Rousseau should he ever enter the territory of the republic. The Genevan
clergy made no protest against this repudiation of Ge neva’s most famous
living son; doubtless they feared that any sympathy shown by them to the
author of “The Savoyard Vicar’s Profession of Faith” would confirm
d’Alembert’s revelation of their secret Unitarian sentiments. Jacob
Vernes, Rousseau’s friend of many years, turned against him and de -
manded a retraction. “If [Rousseau recalled] there was any rumor amongst
the populace, it was unfavorable to me, and I was publicly treated by
all the gossips and pedants like a pupil threatened with a flogging for
not having recited his catechism rightly.” 6</p>
<p>Voltaire was touched by the situation of his rival. He had read
Emile; his comments can still be seen on his copy in the Bibliotheque de
Geneve. In a letter of June 15 he had written of the book: “It is a
hodgepodge of a silly</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII ) ROUSSEAU OUTCAST 191</p>
<p>wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity,
among the boldest ever known…. He says as many hurtful things against
the philos- ophers as against Jesus Christ, but the philosophers will be
more indulgent than the priests.” 7 In any case he admired the
“Profession of Faith”: “fifty good pages,” he called them, but added:
“it is regrettable that they should have been written by… such a knave [
coquin ].” 8 To Mme. du Deffand he wrote: “I shall always love the
author of the ‘Vicaire Savoyard’ whatever</p>
<p>Early in July, 1762, the Senate of Bern notified Rousseau that it
could not tolerate his presence on Bernese soil; he must leave it within
fifteen days or face imprisonment. Meanwhile he received a kindly note
from d’Alembert advising him to seek domicile in the principality of
Neuchatel; this was under the jurisdiction of Frederick the Great, and
was governed by Earl Marischal George Keith, who, said d’Alembert,
“would receive and treat you as the</p>
<p>The King of Prussia:</p>
<p>I have said a good deal that is bad about you; I shall probably say
more such things; however, chased from France, from Geneva, from the
canton of Bern, I have come to seek an asylum in your states…. Sir, I
have not merited grace from you, and I do not ask any; but I have felt
that I ought to declare to your Majesty that I am in your power, and
that I have willed to be so. Your Majesty may dispose of me as you
like.</p>
<p>At an uncertain date Frederick, still in the Seven Years’ War, wrote
to Keith:</p>
<p>We must succor this poor unfortunate. His only offense is to have
strange opinions which he thinks are good ones. I will send a hundred
crowns, from which you will be kind enough to give him as much as he
needs. I think he will accept them in kind more readily than in cash. If
we were not at war, if we were not ruined, I would build him a hermitage
with a garden, where he could live as I believe our first fathers did….
I think poor Rousseau has missed his vocation; he was obviously born to
be a famous anchorite, a desert father, cele- brated for his austerities
and flagellations…. I conclude that the morals of your savage are as
pure as his mind is illogical. 15</p>
<p>I 9 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>The Marischal, whom Rousseau speaks of as a gaunt, aged,
absent-minded saint, sent him provisions, coal, and wood, and proposed
to “build me a little house.” Jean -Jacques interpreted this offer as
coming from Frederick, and refused it, but “from that moment I became so
sincerely attached to him that</p>
<p>Sire:</p>
<p>You are my protector and my benefactor, and I have a heart made for
grati- tude; I want to acquit myself with you if I can.</p>
<p>You want to give me bread; is there none of your subjects who lacks
it?</p>
<p>Take away from before my eyes that sword that flashes and wounds me….
The career of kings of your mettle is great, and you are still far from
your time. But time is pressing; there is not a moment left you to
lose…. Can you resolve to die without having been the greatest of
men?</p>
<p>Could I ever be permitted to see Frederick the Just and Feared cover
his states at last with a happy people whose father he would be, then
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the enemy of kings, would go to die of joy at the
foot of his throne. 17</p>
<p>Frederick made no known answer, but when Keith went to Berlin the
King told him he had received a “scolding” from Rousseau. 18</p>
<p>Apparently assured of a home, Jean-Jacques sent for Therese to join
him. He was not certain that she would come, for he “had long perceived
her affection to grow colder.” He ascribed this to his having ceased to
have sexual relations with her, since “a connection with women was
prejudicial to my health.” 19 Perhaps now she would prefer Paris to
Switzerland. But she came. They had a tearful reunion, and looked
forward at last to some years of peace.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ROUSSEAU AND THE ARCHBISHOP</li>
</ol>
<p>Their next four years were their unhappiest. The Calvinist clergy
of</p>
<p>Neuchatel publicly denounced Rousseau as a heretic, and the
magistrates forbade the sale of £mile. Perhaps to appease them, or in
sincere desire to follow the precepts of his “Vicar,” Rousseau asked the
pastor at Motiers might he join the congregation. (Therese remained
Catholic.) He was ac- cepted, attended worship, and received Communion
“with an emotion of heart, and my eyes suffused with tears of
tenderness.” 20 He gave a handle to ridicule by adopting Armenian
costume — fur bonnet, caftan, and girdle; the long robe allowed him to
conceal the effects of his urinary obstruction. He attended church in
this garb, and wore it in visiting Lord Keith, who made no comment upon
it except to wish him salaam aleikum. He continued to add to his income
by copying music; now he added needlework, and learned to make lace.
“Like the women, I carried my cushion with me when I made visits, or sat
down to work at my door…. This enabled me to pass my time with my female
neighbors without weariness.” 21</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>*93</p>
<p>Probably about this time (late 1762) his publishers prevailed upon
him to begin writing his Confessions. He had forsworn authorship, but
this would not be authorship so much as a defense of his character and
conduct against a world of enemies, and especially against charges of
the philosophes and the gossip of the salons. Furthermore, he had to
answer a great variety of cor- respondence. Women especially offered him
the consoling incense of their adoration, and not only because of their
sympathy with the hunted author of a famous romance, but because they
longed to revert to religion, and saw in the Savoyard Vicar and his
creator no real foe of faith but its brave cham- pion against a
desolating atheism. For such women, and several men, he be- came a
father confessor, a director of souls and consciences. He advised them
to remain in, or return to, the religion of their youth, regardless of
all the difficulties that science and philosophy had suggested; those
incredibilities were not of the essence, and might be silently put
aside; what mattered was trust in God and immortality; with that faith
and hope one could rise above all the unintelligible disasters of
nature, all the pains and griefs of life. A young Catholic in rebellion
against his religion asked for sympathy; Rous- seau, forgetting his own
rebellions, told him not to make so much ado about incidentals: “if I
had been born Catholic I would have remained Catholic, knowing well that
your Church puts a very salutary restraint upon the wan- derings of
human reason, which finds neither bottom nor bank when it would sound
the abysses of things.” 22 To nearly all these suitors for wisdom he ad
- vised a flight from the city to the country, from artifice and
complexity to a natural simplicity of life, and a modest contentment
with marriage and parenthood.</p>
<p>Women who had been shocked by worldly priests and agnostic abbes fell
in love, if only through correspondence, with this unworldly heretic
whom all the churches denounced. Mme. de Blot, titled and respected,
exclaimed to a company of lords and ladies, “ Only the loftiest virtue
could keep a woman of true sensibility from devoting her life to
Rousseau, if she were certain he would love her passionately.” 23 Mme.
de La Tour mistook some compliments in his letters for an avowal of
love; she responded tenderly, warmly, effu- sively; she sent him her
portrait, protesting that it did not do her justice; she grew despondent
when he replied with the calmness of a man who had never seen her. 24
Yet other worshipers wished to kiss the ground he walked on; some raised
altars to him in their hearts; some called him the reborn Christ. At
times he took them seriously, and thought of himself as the crucified
founder of a new faith. 25</p>
<p>Amid these exaltations, and as if to confirm the analogy, a high
priest of the Temple aroused the people to condemn him as a dangerous
revolutionary. On August 20, 1762, Christophe de Beaumont, archbishop of
Paris, issued a mandate to all priests in his diocese to read to their
congregations, and to publish to the world, his twenty-nine-page
denunciation of Emile. He was a man of rigorous orthodoxy and saintly
repute; he had fought against the Jansenists, the Encyclopedic, and the
philosophes ; now it seemed to him that Rousseau, after apparently
breaking away from the infidels, had joined them</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>in attacking the faith upon which, in the Archbishop’s view, rested
the whole social order and moral life of France.</p>
<p>He began by quoting St. Paul’s Second Epistle to Timothy: “There will
come perilous days of men enamored of themselves, bold and proud blas-
phemers, impious calumniators swollen with arrogance, lovers of pleasure
rather than God, men corrupt in spirit and perverse in faith.” 26 Surely
those times had come!</p>
<p>Unbelief, emboldened by all the passions, presents itself under every
form to adapt itself in some way to all ages, characters, and degrees.
Sometimes… it borrows a style light, agreeable, and frivolous; hence so
many tales, as obscene as they are impious [Voltaire’s romans], amusing
the imagination as a means of seducing the mind and corrupting the
heart. Sometimes, affecting profundity and sublimity in its views, it
pretends to go back to the first principles of knowledge, and to assume
divine authority, in order to throw off a yoke which, they say,
dishonors mankind. Sometimes it declaims like a raging woman against
religious zeal, and yet with enthusiasm preaches universal toleration.
And some- times, uniting all these diverse manners of speech, it mixes
the serious with the playful, pure maxims with obscenities, great truths
with great errors, the Faith with blasphemy; in a word, it undertakes to
reconcile light with dark- ness, Jesus Christ with Belial. 27</p>
<p>This, said the Archbishop, was especially the method of Emile, a book
full of the language of philosophy without being truly philosophy;
replete with bits of knowledge which have not enlightened the author and
must only con- fuse his readers; a man given to paradoxes of opinions
and conduct, allying simplicity of manners with pomp of thought, ancient
maxims with a madness of innovation, the obscurity of his retreat with
the desire to be known by all the world. He denounces the sciences, and
cultivates them; he praises the excellence of the Gospel, and destroys
its teachings. He has made himself the Preceptor of the Human Race to
deceive it, the Monitor of the Public to mislead the world, the Oracle
of the Century to destroy it. What an</p>
<p>enterprise ! 28</p>
<p>The Archbishop was appalled by Rousseau’s proposal to make no mention
of God or religion to Emile before the age of twelve, or even eighteen.
So, then, “all nature would in vain have declared the glory of their
Creator,” and all moral instruction would forfeit the support of
religious faith. But man is not by nature good, as the author supposed;
he is born with the taint of original sin; he shares in the general
corruption of humanity. The wise educa- tor-best of all, a priest guided
by divine grace — will use every just means to nourish the good impulses
in men, and to weed out the evil; therefore he will feed the child with
“the spiritual milk of religion, that it may grow toward salvation”;
only by such education can the child develop into a “sincere worshiper
of the true God, and a faithful subject of the sovereign.” 29 So much
sin and crime survive even this assiduous instruction; imagine what they
would be without it. A torrent of wickedness would engulf us. 30</p>
<p>For these reasons, concluded the Archbishop,</p>
<p>after having consulted several persons distinguished for their piety
and wisdom, and having invoked the holy name of God, we condemn the said
book as con-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>!95</p>
<p>aining an abominable doctrine subversive of natural law and the
foundations of the Christian religion; as establishing principles
contrary to the moral teach- ing of the Gospels; as tending to disturb
the peace of states and lead the revolt against the authority of the
sovereign; as containing a very great number of propositions false,
scandalous, full of hatred against the Church and her minis- ters….
Therefore we expressly forbid each and every person in our diocese to
read or keep the said book, under the penalties of the law. 31</p>
<p>This mandate was printed “with the privilege of the King,” and soon
reached Motiers-Travers. Rousseau, always resolving to write no more,
de- cided to reply. Before he put down his pen (November 18, 1762) he
had let his answer run to 128 pages. It was printed at Amsterdam in
March, 1763, as Jean-J acques Rousseau, Citoyen de Geneve, d Christoploe
de Beaumont, Archeveque de Paris. It was soon condemned by the Parlement
of Paris and the Council of Geneva. Attacked by both the leading
religions of Europe, Rousseau retaliated by assailing them both; now the
shy romantic who had disowned the philosophes repeated their arguments
with reckless audacity.</p>
<p>He opened with a question that all opponents in the unending debate
still ask of each other: “Why must I say anything to you, monseigneur?
What common language can we speak, how can we understand each other?” 32
He regretted that he had ever written books; he had not done this till
he was thirty-eight, and he had fallen into this error by the accident
of noticing that “miserable question” of the Dijon Academy. The critics
of his Discourse had led him to reply; “dispute led to dispute,… a nd I
found myself, so to speak, becoming an author at an age when one usually
abandons authorship”; from that time to this, “repose and friends have
disappeared.” 33 In all his career, he claimed, he had been</p>
<p>more ardent than enlightened,… but sincere in everything;… simple and
good, but sensitive and weak, often doing evil and always loving the
good;… adhering rather to my sentiments than to my interests;… fearing
God without fearing hell; reasoning on religion, but without
libertinage; loving neither impiety nor fanaticism, but hating the
intolerant more than the free- thinkers;… confessing my faults to mv
friends and my opinions to all the world. 34</p>
<p>He mourned less the Catholic than the Calvinist condemnation of
Emile. He who had proudly called himself Citoyen de Geneve had fled from
France hoping to breathe in his native city the air of freedom, and to
find there a welcome that would console him for his humiliations. But
now “what am I to say? My heart closes up, my hand trembles, the pen
falls from it. I must be silent;… I must consume in secret the bitterest
of my griefs.” 35 Behold the man who, “in the century so celebrated for
philosophy, reason, and hu - manity,” dared to “defend the cause of
God”— behold him “branded, pro - scribed, hunted from country to
country, from refuge to refuge, without regard for his poverty, without
pity for his infirmities”; finding asylum at last under “an illustrious
and enlightened prince,” and secluding himself in a little village
hidden among the mountains of Switzerland; thinking at last to find
obscurity and peace, but pursued even there by the anathemas of priests.
This Archbishop, “a virtuous man, as noble in soul as in birth,”</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>should have reproved the persecutors; instead, he authorized them
shame- lessly, “he who should have pleaded the cause of the oppressed.”
36 Rousseau perceived that the Archbishop was particularly offended by
the doctrine that men are born good, or at least not evil; Beaumont
realized that if this were true, if man is not tainted at birth by
inheriting the guilt of Adam and Eve, then the doctrine of atonement by
Christ would fall; and this doc- trine was the very heart of the
Christian creed. Rousseau answered that the doctrine of original sin is
nowhere clearly stated in the Bible. He realized that the Archbishop was
shocked by the proposal to defer religious instruction; he replied that
the education of children by nuns and priests had not lessened sin or
crime; those pupils, grown up, had lost their fear of hell, and
preferred a small pleasure at hand to all Paradise in promise; and those
priests them- selves — were they models of virtue in contemporary France
? 37 Nevertheless, “I am a Christian, sincerely Christian, according to
the doctrine of the Gos - pel; not a Christian as a disciple of the
priests, but as a disciple of Jesus Christ.” Then, with an eye on
Geneva, Rousseau added: “H appy to have been born in the holiest and
most reasonable religion on the earth, I remain inviolably attached to
the faith of my fathers. Like them, I take Scripture and reason as the
sole rules of my belief.” 38 He felt the reproach of those who</p>
<p>This is what they cry out to me on every side; this perhaps is what
you your- self would tell me if we two were alone in your study. Such
are men; they change their language with their clothes; they speak the
truth only in their dressing gowns; in their public dress they know only
how to lie. And not only are they deceivers and impostors in the face of
mankind, but they are not ashamed to punish, against their own
conscience, whoever refuses to be public cheats and liars like
themselves. 39</p>
<p>This difference between what we believe and what we preach is at the
heart of the corruption in modern civilization. There are prejudices
which we should respect, but not if they turn education into a massive
deception and undermine the moral basis of society. 40 And if those
prejudices become mur- derous shall we still be silent about their
crimes?</p>
<p>I do not say, nor do I think, that there is no good religion,… but I
do say… that there is none, among those which have been dominant, that
has not inflicted cruel wounds upon humanity. All sects have tormented
others, all have offered to God the sacrifice of human blood. Whatever
may be the source of these contradictions, they exist; is it a crime to
wish to remove them ? 41</p>
<p>Toward the end of his reply Rousseau defended his £mile lovingly, and
wondered why no statue had been raised to its author.</p>
<p>Assuming that I have made some mistakes, even that I have always been
wrong, is no indulgence due to a book in which one feels everywhere —
even in its errors, even in the harm that may be in it — a sincere love
of the good and a zeal for the truth?… A book which breathes only peace,
gentleness, pa- tience, love of order, and obedience to the laws in
everything, even in the mat- ter of religion? A book in which the cause
of religion is so well established, where morals are so respected,…
where wickedness is painted as folly, and</p>

<p>197</p>
<p>virtue as so lovable?… Yes, 1 do not fear to say it: if there were in
Europe a single government truly enlightened,… it would render public
honors to the author of Emile , it would raise statues to him. I know
men too well to expect such recognition; I did not know them well enough
to expect that which they have done. 42</p>
<p>They have raised statues to him.</p>

<li>ROUSSEAU AND THE CALVINISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Letter to Christophe Beaumont pleased only a few freethinkers in
France and a few political rebels in Switzerland. Of twenty- three
“refuta - tions” addressed to the author, nearly al l were from
Protestants. The Calvin- ist clergy of Geneva saw in the Letter an
attack upon miracles and Biblical inspiration; to condone such heresies
would be to invite again the danger to which they had been exposed by
d’Alembert. Angry at the failure of Genevan liberals to speak out in his
defense, Rousseau (May 12, 1763) sent to the Grand Council of Geneva a
renunciation of his citizenship.</p>
<p>This action won some audible support. On June 18 a delegation
submitted to the First Syndic of the republi c a “Very Humble and
Respectful Repre - sentation of Citizens and Burghers of Geneva,” which,
among other griev - ances, complained that the judgment against Rousseau
had been illegal, and that the confiscation of copies of Smile from
Genevan bookstores had in- vaded property rights. The Council of
Twenty-five rejected the protest, and in September the public
prosecutor, Jean-Robert Tronchin (cousin of Vol- taire’s doctor) issued
Lettres ecrites de la campagne, defending the disputed actions of the
Council. The “Representants” appealed to Rousseau to answer</p>
<p>Formally he addressed the letters to the leader of the Representants.
He began by dealing with the harm done to himself through the hasty
condem- nation of his books and his person, without any opportunity for
defense. He admitted the imperfections of his books: “I myself have
found a great num - ber of errors in them; I doubt not that others may
see many more, and that there are still others that neither I nor others
have perceived…. After having heard both parties the public will judge;…
the book will triumph or fall, and the case is close d.” 43 But was the
book “pernicious”? Could any - one read La Nouvelle Heloise and the
“Profession de foi du vicaire Savoyard” and really believe that their
author intended to destroy religion? True, these writings sought to
destroy superstition as “the most terrible plague of man- kind, the
sorrow of sages and the tool of tyranny”; 44 but did they not affirm the
necessity of religion? The author is accused of not believing in Christ;
he believes in Christ, but in a different way from his accusers:</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>We recognize the authority of Jesus Christ because our intelligence
agrees with his precepts and we find them sublime…. We admit revelation
as emanating from the Spirit of God, without our knowing how…. Recog-
nizing a divine authority in the Gospel, we believe that Jesus Christ
was clothed with this authority; we recognize a more than human virtue
in his conduct, and a more than human wisdom in his teaching.</p>
<p>The second letter (forgetting The Social Contract) denied the right
of a civic council to judge in matters of religion. A basic principle of
the Protes- tant Reformation, the right of the individual to interpret
Scripture for him- self, had been violated in condemning Emile.* 5 “If y
ou prove to me today that in matters of faith I am obliged to submit to
the decisions of someone else, tomorrow I shall become a Catholic.” 46
Rousseau admitted that the Re - formers in their turn had become
persecutors of individual interpretation , 47 but this did not
invalidate the principle without which the Protestant revolt against the
papal authority would have been unjust. He accused the Calvinist clergy
(“except my pastor”) of taking over the intolerant spirit of Catholi -
cism; if they had been true to the spirit of the Reformation they would
have defended his right to publish his own interpretation of the Bible.
He now had a good word to say for d’Alembert’s view of the Genevan
clergy:</p>
<p>A philosopher casts a quick glance upon them; he penetrates them,
sees that they are Arians, Socinians; he says so, and thinks to do them
honor; but he does not see that he is endangering their temporal
interests — the only matter that generally determines, here below, the
faith of men. 48</p>
<p>In his third letter he took up the charge that he had rejected
miracles. If we define a miracle as a violation of the laws of nature we
can never know if anything is a miracle, for we do not know all the laws
of nature. 49 Even then every day saw a new “miracle” achieved by
science, not in contraven - tion, but through greater knowledge, of
nature’s laws. “Anciently the Proph - ets made fire descend from the sky
at their word; today children do as much with a lit tle piece of
[burning] glass.” Joshua made the sun stop; any almanac maker can
promise the same result by calculating a solar eclipse. 50 And as
Europeans who perform such wonders among barbarians are thought by these
to be gods, so the “miracles” of t he past — even those of Jesus — may
have been natural results misinterpreted by the populace as divine
interruptions of natural law. 51 Perhaps Lazarus, whom Christ raised
from the dead, had not really been dead. — Besides, how can the
“miracles” of a te acher prove the truth of his doctrine when teachers
of doctrines generally considered false have performed “miracles”
reported as equally real, as when the magicians of Egypt rivaled Aaron
in turning wands into serpents ? 52 Christ warned against “false
Christs” who “shall show great signs as wonders.” 53</p>
<p>Rousseau had begun his letters with a view to helping the
middle-class Representants; he made no plea for the further extension of
the franchise in a democratic direction. Indeed, in Letter vi he again
committed himself to an elected “aristocracy” as the best form of
government, and he assured the rulers of Geneva that the ideal which he
had sketched in The Social Contract was essentially one with the Genevan
constitution. 54 But in Letter vii he told</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>his friends of the protesting bourgeoisie that that constitution
acknowledged the sovereignty of the enfranchised citizens only during
the elections to the General Council and its annual assembly; for the
remainder of the year the citizens were powerless. 55 In all that long
interval the small Council of Twenty- five was the “supreme arbiter of
the laws, and thereby of the fate of all individuals.” In effect the
citoyens et bourgeois , who appeared sover- eign in the Conseil General,
became, after its adjournment, “the slaves of a despotic power,
delivered defenseless to the mercy of twenty- five despots.” 56 This was
almost a call to revolution. However, Rousseau deprecated such a last
resort. In his final letter he praised the bourgeoisie as the sanest and
most peace-loving class in the state, caught between an opulent and
oppressive patriciate and a “brutish and stupid populace”; 57 but he adv
ised the Repre- sentants to keep their patience and trust to justice and
time to right their wrongs.</p>
<p>The Lettres de la montagne offended Rousseau’s enemies and displeased
his friends. The Genevan clergy were alarmed by his heresies, and still
more by his claim that they shared them. Now he turned violently against
the Calvinist ministers, called them “canaille, swindlers, stupid
courtiers, mad wolves,” and expressed preference for the simple Catholic
priests of the French villages and towns. 58 The Representants made no
use of the Letters in their successful campaign for more political
power; they considered Rous- seau a dangerous and incalculable ally. He
resolved to take no further part in Genevan politics.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ROUSSEAU AND VOLTAIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>He had wondered, in Letter v, why “M. de Voltaire,” whom the Genevan
councilors “so often visit,” had not “inspired them with that spirit of
toler - ance which he preaches without cease, and of which he sometimes
has need.” And he put into Voltaire’s mouth an imaginary speech 59
favoring freedom of speech for philosophers on the ground that only a
negligible few read them. The imitation of Voltaire’s light and graceful
manner was excellent. But the sage of Ferney was represented as avowing
his authorship of a recently pub- lished Sermon des cinquantes ( Sermon
of the Fifty), whose paternity Vol- taire had repeatedly denied — for it
was heavy with heresies. We do not know whether Rousseau’s revelation of
the secret was deliberate and malicious; Voltaire thought so, and was
furious, for it subjected him to the possibility of renewed expulsion
from France just as he was settling into Ferney.</p>
<p>“The miscreant!” he exclaimed when he read the telltale letter. “The
mon - ster! I must have him cudgeled — yes, I will have him cudgeled in
his moun- tains at the knees of his nurse!”</p>
<p>“Pray calm yourself,” said a bystander, “for I know that Rousseau
means to pay you a visit, and will very shortly be at Ferney.”</p>
<p>“Ah, only let him come!” cried Voltaire, apparently meditating
mayhem.</p>
<p>“But how will you receive him?”</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>“I will give him supper, put him into my own bed, and say, ‘There is
a good supper; this is the best bed in the house; do me the pleasure to
accept one and the other, and to make yourself happy here.’” 60</p>
<p>But Rousseau did not come. Voltaire revenged himself by issuing
(Decem- ber 31, 1764) an anonymous pamphlet, Sentiments des citoyens (
Feelings of the Citizens ), which is one of the blackest marks on his
character and career. It must be quoted to be believed.</p>
<p>We take pity on a fool, but when his dementia becomes fury we tie him
up. Tolerance, which is a virtue, then becomes a vice…. We pardoned this
man’s romances, in which decency and modesty are as damaged as good
sense…. When he mixed religion with his fiction, our magistrates were of
necessity obliged to imitate those of Paris… and Bern…. Today is not
patience exhausted when he publishes a new book wherein he outrages with
fury the Christian religion, the Reformation that he professes, all the
ministers of the Holy Gospel, and all the agencies of the state?… He
says clearly, in his own name, “There are no miracl es in the Gospel
which we can take literally without abandoning good sense.”…</p>
<p>Is he a scholar who debates with scholars? No,… he is a man who still
carries the tragic marks of his debauches, and who… drags along with him
from town to town, and from mountain to mountain, the unhappy woman
whose mother he made die, and whose children he exposed at the door of a
hospital,… abjuring all the feelings of nature, as he discards those of
honor and religion….</p>
<p>Does he wish to overthrow our constitution by disfiguring it, as he
wishes to overthrow the Christianity that he professes? It suffices to
warn him that the city which he troubles disavows him…. If he thought
that we would draw the sword [make a revolution] because of [the
condemnation of] Emile , he can put this idea into the class of his
absurdities and his follies. But he should be told that if we punish
lightly an impious romance we punish capitally a vile traitor. 61</p>
<p>This was a disgraceful performance, hardly to be excused by
Voltaire’s anger, ailments, and age. (He was now seventy.) No wonder
Rousseau never believed (even today we can hardly believe) that Voltaire
wrote it; he ascribed it instead to the Genevan minister Vernes, who
protested in vain that he was not the author. Rousseau, in one of his
finest moments, published a reply to the Sentiments (January, 1765):</p>
<p>I wish to make with simplicity the declaration that seems required of
me by this article. No malady small or great, such as the author speaks
of, has ever soiled my body. The malady that affects me has not the
slightest resem- blance to the one indicated; it was born with me, as
those who took care of my childhood, and who still live, know. It is
known to MM. Malouin, Morand, Thierry, Daran…. If they find in this
[ailment] the least sign of debauchery, I beg them to confound me and
shame me…. The wise and world-esteemed woman who takes care of me in my
misfortunes… is unhappy only be- cause she shares my misery. Her mother
is in fact full of life, and in good health, despite her old age [she
lived to be ninety-three]. I have never exposed, nor caused to be
exposed, any children at the door of a hospital, nor anywhere else…. I
will add nothing more… except to say that, at the hour of death, I would
prefer to have done that of which the author accuses me, than to have
written a piece like this. 62</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>Though Rousseau’s delivery of his children to a foundling asylum (not
quite precisely their “exposure”) had been known to Paris gossip (he had
admitted it to the Marechale de Luxembourg), Voltaire’s pamphlet was the
first public disclosure. Jean-Jacques suspected Mme. d’fipinay of having
re - vealed it on her visit to Geneva. Now he was convinced that she and
Grimm and Diderot were conspiring to blacken his reputation. Grimm at
this time repeatedly attacked Rousseau in the Correspondance litter aire
, 63 and in his letter of January 15, 1765, speaking of the Letters from
the Mountain, he joined Voltaire in accusing Rousseau of treason: “If
there be anywhere on earth such a crime as high treason, it is found
surely in attacking the funda- mental constitution of a state with the
arms that M. Rousseau has employed to overthrow the constitution of his
country.”</p>
<p>The long quarrel between Voltaire and Rousseau is one of the sorriest
blemishes on the face of the Enlightenment. Their birth and status set
them far apart. Voltaire, son of a prosperous notary, received a good
education, especially in the classics; Rousseau, born to an impoverished
and soon to be broken home, received no formal education, inherited no
classical tradition. Voltaire accepted the literary norms laid down by
Boileau — “Love reason, let all your writings take from reason their
splendor and their worth”; 64 to Rous - seau (as to Faust seducing
Marguerite with Rousseau) “feeling is all.” 65 Vol - taire was as
sensitive and excitable as Jean-Jacques, but usually he thought it bad
manners to let passion discolor his art; he sensed in Rousseau’s appeal
to feeling and instinct an individualistic anarchic irrationalism that
would begin with revolt and end with religion. He repudiated — Rousseau
echoed — Pascal. Voltaire lived like a millionaire, Rousseau copied
music to earn his bread. Voltaire was the sum of all the graces in
society; Rousseau was ill at ease in social gatherings, and too
impatient and irritable to keep a friend. Voltaire was the son of Paris,
of its gaiety and luxuries; Rousseau was the child of Geneva, a somber
and Puritan bourgeois resentful of class distinc- tions that cut him,
and of luxuries that he could not enjoy. Voltaire defended luxury as
putting the money of the rich in circulation by giving work to the poor;
Rousseau condemned it as “feeding a hundred poor people in our towns,
and causing a hundred thousand to perish in our villages.” 66 Voltaire
thought that the sins of civilization are outweighed by its comforts and
arts; Rousseau was uncomfortable everywhere, and denounced almost
everything. Reformers listened to Voltaire; revolutionists heard
Rousseau.</p>
<p>When Horace Walpole remarked that “this world is a comed y to those
who think, a tragedy to those who feel,” 67 he unwittingly compressed
into a line the lives of the two most influential minds of the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p>V. BOSWELL MEETS ROUSSEAU</p>
<p>We get an exceptionally pleasant picture of Jean-Jacques in Boswell’s
re - port of five visits to him in December, 1764. The inescapable
idolator had solemnly sworn (October 21) “neither to talk to an infidel,
nor to enjoy a</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>woman, before seeing Rousseau.” 68 On December 3 he set out from
Neucha - tel for Motiers-Travers. At Brot, halfway, he stopped at an
inn, and asked the landlord’s daughter what she knew about his prey. Her
reply was dis - concerting:</p>
<p>“Monsieur Rousseau often comes and stays here several days with his
house- keeper, Mademoiselle Levasseur. He is a very amiable man. He has
a fine face. But he doesn’t like to have people come and stare at him as
if he were a man</p>
<p>Of course Boswell went ahead. At Motiers he put up at the village inn
and</p>
<p>prepared a letter to M. Rousseau, in which I informed him that an
ancient Scots gentleman of twenty-four was come hither with the hopes of
seeing him. I assured him that I deserved his regard…. Towards the end
of my letter I showed him that I had a heart and soul…. The letter is
really a masterpiece. I shall ever preserve it as proof that my soul can
be sublime. 70</p>
<p>His letter — in French — was a subtle mixture of deliberate naivete
and irre- sistible adulation:</p>
<p>Your writings, Sir, have melted my heart, have elevated my soul, have
fired my imagination. Believe me, you will be glad to have seen me…. O
dear Saint-Preux! Enlightened Mentor! Eloquent and amiable Rousseau! I
have a presentiment that a truly noble friendship will be born today…. I
have much to tell you. Though I am only a young man, I have experienced
a variety of existence that will amaze you…. But I beg you, be alone…. I
know not if I would not prefer never to see you than to see you for the
first time in company. I await your reply with impatience. 71</p>
<p>Rousseau sent word that he might come if he promised to make his
visit short. Boswell went, “dressed in a coat and waistcoat, scarlet
with gold lace, buckskin breeches, and boots. Above all, I wore a
greatcoat of green camlet lined with foxskin fur.” The door was opened
by Therese, “a little, lively, neat French girl.” She led him upstairs
to Rousseau— “a genteel black [dark - complexioned] man in the dress of
an Armenian…. I asked him how he was. ‘Very ill, but I have given up
doctors.’” Rousseau expressed admiration for Frederick, scorn for the
French — “a contemptible nation,” but “you will find great souls in
Spain.” Boswell: “And in the mountains of Scotland.” Rousseau s poke of
theologians as “gentlemen” who “provide a new explana - tion of
something, leaving it as incomprehensible as before.” They discussed
Corsica; Rousseau said he had been asked to draw up laws for it; Boswell
began his lasting enthusiasm for Corsican independence. Presently
Rousseau dismissed him, saying that he wished to go for a walk by
himself.</p>
<p>On December 4 Boswell returned to the siege. Rousseau talked with him
for a while, then dismissed him: “You are irksome to me. It’s my nature,
I cannot help it.” Boswell: “Do not stand on ceremony with me.”
Rousseau: “Go away.” Therese saw Boswell to the door. She told him, “I
have been twenty-two years with Monsieur Rousseau; I would not give my
place to be queen of France. I try to profit by the good advice he gives
me. If he should die, I shall have to go into a convent.” 72</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>Boswell was at the door again on December 5. Rousseau sighed, “My
dear sir, I am sorry not to be able to talk with you as I would wish.”
Boswell “waived such excuses,” and stirred conversation by saying “I had
turned Roman Catholic and intended to hide myself in a convent.”
Rousseau: “What folly!”… Boswell: “Tell me sincerely, are you a
Christian?”</p>
<p>Rousseau “struck his breast and replied, ‘Yes, I pique myself on
being one.’” Boswell (who suffered from melancholy): “Tell me, do you
suffer from melancholy?” Rousseau: “I was born placid. I have no natural
disposition to melancholy. My misfortunes have infected me with it.”
Boswell: “What do you think of cloisters, penances, and remedies of that
sort?” Rousseau: “Mummeries, all of them.” Boswell: “Will you, sir,
assume [spiritual] direc - tion of me?” Rousseau: “I cannot.” Boswell:
“I shall come back.” Rousseau: “I don’t promise to see you. I am in
pain. I need a chamber pot every minute.” 73</p>
<p>That afternoon, in the maison du village, Boswell wrote a
fourteen-page “Sketch of My Life,” and sent it to Rousseau. It confe
ssed one of his adul- teries, and asked, “Is it possible for me yet to
make myself a man?” He re - turned to Neuchatel, but was back at
Rousseau’s door on December 14. Therese told him her master was “very
ill.” Boswell persisted; Rousseau received him. “I found him sitting in
great pain.” Rousseau: “I am overcome</p>
<p>Boswell was back at four, dreaming of Louis XV. “Morals appear to me
an uncertain thing. For instance, I should like to have thirty women.
Could I not satisfy that desire?” “No.” “But consider, if I am rich, I
can take a number of girls; I get them with child; propagation is thus
increased. I give them dowries, and I marry them off to good peasants
who are very happy to have them. Thus they become wives at the same age
as would have been the case if they had remained virgins, and I, on my
side, have had the benefit of enjoying a great variety of women.” Then,
having made no impression with this royal hypothesis, he asked, “Pray
tell me how I can expiate the evil I have done?” Rousseau made a golden
answer: “There is no expiation for evil except good.” 74 Boswell asked
Rousseau to invite him to dinner; Rousseau said, “Tomorrow.” Boswell
returned to the inn “full of fine spirits.”</p>
<p>On December 15 he dined with Jean-Jacques and Therese in the kitchen,
which he found “neat and cheerful.” Rousseau was in good humor, with no
sign of the mental disturbances that were later to appear. His dog and
cat got along well together and with him. “He put some victuals on a
trencher,</p>
<p>Mile. Levasseur: “Shall you, sir, see Monsieur de Voltaire?”
Boswell:</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>“Most certainly.” Then to Rousseau: “Monsieur de Voltaire has no
liking for you.” Rousseau: “One does not like those whom one has greatly
injured. His talk is most enjoyable; it is even better than his books.”
Boswell over - stayed his welcome, but when he left, Rousseau “kissed me
several times, and held me in his arms with elegant cordiality.” When
Boswell reached the inn the landlady said, “Sir, I think you have been
crying.” “This,” he adds, “I retain as a true eulogium of my humanity.”
75</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>A CONSTITUTION FOR CORSICA</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps at Rousseau’s prompting, Boswell, after visiting Voltaire at
Fer - ney, went on to Italy, Naples, and Corsica. Corsica, under the
leadership of Pasquale di Paoli, had freed itself from Genoese
domination (1755). Rous- seau, in The Social Contract, had hailed the
birth of the new state:</p>
<p>There is still one country in Europe open to the Lawgiver. It is the
island of Corsica. The valor and firmness with which this brave people
has shown itself able to regain and defend its freedom richly deserve
the aid of some wise man who will teach them how to preserve it. I have
a premonition that some day this little island will astonish Europe.
76</p>
<p>Voltaire would have thought Rousseau the last man in Europe to be
invited as a lawgiver; but on August 31, 1764, Jean-Jacques received the
following letter from Matteo Buttafuoco, Corsican envoy to France:</p>
<p>You mentioned Corsica, sir, in your Contrat social , in a way most
flattering to our country. Such praise from a pen so sincere as yours…
has suggested the strong wish that you could be the wise legislator who
would assist the na- tion to maintain the liberties obtained at the cost
of so much blood. I recognize, of course, that the task I dare press you
to undertake needs a special knowl- edge of details…. If you deign to
accept this charge, I would supply you with all the illumination
necessary; and M. Paoli… will use his best endeav- ors to send you from
Corsica all the information you may want. This distin- guished chief,
and indeed all my compatriots who have the advantage to know your works,
share my desire, and the sentiments of respect that all Europe has for
you, and which are due you on so many grounds. 77</p>
<p>Rousseau’s reply (October 15, 1764) accepted the assignment and asked
for material illustrating the character, history, and problems of the
Corsican peo ple. He confessed that the task might be “beyond my power,
though not beyond my zeal”; but “I promise you,” he wrote to Buttafuoco
on May 26, 1765, “that for the rest of my life I shall have no other
interest but my - self and Corsica; all other matters will be completely
banished from my thoughts.” 78 He began work at once on his Projet de
constitution pour la Corse.</p>
<p>With the “social contract” in mind, Rousseau proposed that every
citizen should sign a solemn and irrevocable pledge of himself — “bod y,
goods, will, and all my powers”— to the Corsican nation. 79 He hailed
the braves Corses who had won their independence, but he warned them
that they had many</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>vices — laziness, banditry, feuds, ferocity — mostly derived from
hatred of their foreign masters. The best cure for these vices is a
completely agricul- tural life. The laws should give every inducement to
the people to remain on the land rather than gather in cities.
Agriculture makes for individual char- acter and national health; trade,
commerce, finance open the doors to all sorts of chicanery, and should
be discouraged by the state. All travel should be on foot or beast.
Early marriage and large families are to be rewarded; men unmarried by
the age of forty should lose their citizenship. Private prop- erty
should be reduced, state property increased. “I should wish to see the
state the sole owner, the individual taking a share of the common
property only in proportion to his services.” 80 If necessary, the
population should be conscripted to till the lands of the state. The
government should control all education, and all public morality. The
form of government should model itself on the Swiss cantons.</p>
<p>In 1768 France bought Corsica from Genoa, sent in an army, deposed
Paoli, and subjected the island to French law. Rousseau abandoned his
Pro- jet, and denounced the French invasion as violating “all justice,
all humanity, all political righ t, all reason.” 81</p>

<p>For two years Rousseau lived modestly and quietly at Motiers,
reading, writing, treating his ailment, suffering an attack of sciatica
(October, 1764), and receiving courteously the visitors who passed
Therese’s scrutiny. One of these described him gratefully:</p>
<p>You have no idea how charming his society is, what true politeness
there is in his manners, what a depth of serenity and cheerfulness in
his talk. Did you not expect quite a different picture, and figure to
yourself an eccentric creature, always grave and sometimes even abrupt?
Ah, what a mistake! To an expression of great mildness he unites a
glance of fire, and eyes the vivacity of which was never seen. When you
handle any matter in which he has taken an interest, then his eyes, his
lips, his hands — everything about him — speak. You would be quite wrong
to picture in him an everlasting grumbler. Not at all; he laughs with
those who laugh, he chats and jokes with children, he rallies his house-
keeper. 82</p>
<p>But the local ministers had discovered the heresies in Emile and the
Letters from the Mountain , and it seemed to them a scandal that such a
monster should further contaminate Switzerland with his presence. To
appease them he offered (March 10, 1765) to bind himself, by a formal
document, “never</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>suffer a long sitting” 84 — which was painfully true. His own pastor
turned against him, and denounced him in public sermons as Antichrist.
85 The at- tacks of the clergy inflamed their parishioners; some
villagers took to stoning Rousseau when he went out for a walk. About
midnight of September 6-7 he and Therese were awakened by stones pelting
their walls and breaking the windows; one large rock came through the
glass and fell at his feet. A neighbor — a village official — summoned
some guards to his rescue; the crowd dispersed; but Rousseau’s remaining
friends in Motiers adv ised him to leave the town.</p>
<p>He had several offers of asylum, “but I was so attached to
Switzerland that I could not resolve to quit it as long as it was
possible for me to live there.” 86 He had visited, a year before, the
tiny lie de St. -Pierre, in the mid- dle of the Lake of Bienne; there
was but one house on the island — the home of the caretaker; here,
thought Rousseau, was an ideal spot for an unpopular lover of solitude.
It was in the canton of Bern, which had ejected him two years before,
but he received informal assurances that he might move to the island
without fear of arrest. 87</p>
<p>And so, about the middle of September, 1765, after twenty-six months
in Motiers, he and Therese left the home that had become dear to them,
and went to board with the caretaker’s family in a place so isolated
that “neither the populace nor the churchmen can trouble it.” 88 “I
thought I should in that island be more separated from men… and sooner
forgotten by man- kind.” 89 To meet his e xpenses he gave the printer Du
Peyrou the right to publish all his works, “and made him the depositary
of all my papers, under the express condition of making no use of them
until after my death, having it at heart to end my days quietly, without
doing anything which would again bring me back to the recollection of
the public.” 90 He was offered an annuity of twelve hundred livres by
Marischal Keith; he agreed to take half. He arranged another annuity for
Therese. He settled down with her on the island, expecting nothing
further of life. He was now fifty-three years old.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later — in the final year of his life — he composed
one of his finest books, Reveries d’un promeneur solitaire. It described
with subdued eloquence his existence on t he Island of St. Peter. “A
delicious idleness was the first and principal enjoyment that I wished
to taste in all its sweetness.” 91 We have seen elsewhere how he admired
Linnaeus; now, with one of the Swedish botanist’s books in his hand, he
began to l ist and study the plants on his little domain. Or on fair
days, like Thoreau on Walden Pond,</p>
<p>I threw myself alone into a boat which 1 rowed out to the middle of
the lake when the water was calm. There, stretching myself out at full
length in the boat, my eyes toward heaven, 1 let myself go and wander
about slowly at the will of the water, sometimes for several hours,
plunged into a thousand delight- ful reveries. 92</p>
<p>Even on these waters he could not long rest. On October 1 7, 1 765,
the Sen- ate of Bern ordered him to leave the island and the canton
within fifteen days. He was bewildered and overwhelmed. “The measures I
had taken to secure the tacit consent of the government, the
tranquillity with which I</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII )</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>had been left to make my establishment, the visits of several people
from Bern,” had led him to believe that he was now safe from molestation
and pursuit. He begged the Senate for some explanation and delay, and
sug- gested a desperate alternative to banishment:</p>
<p>I see but one resource for me, and however frightful it may appear, I
will adopt it not only without repugnance, but with eagerness, if their
Excellencies will be good enough to consent. It is that it should please
them for me to pass the rest of my days in prison in one of their
castles, or such other place in their estates as they may think fit to
select. I will live there at my own expense, and I will give security
never to put them to any cost. I submit to be without paper or pen, or
any communication from without…. Only let me keep, with a few books, the
liberty to walk occasionally in a garden, and I am content. Was his mind
beginning to break down? He assures us to the contrary:</p>
<p>Do not suppose that an expedient so violent in appearance is the
fruit of despair. My mind is perfectly calm at this moment. I have taken
time to de- liberate, and it is only after profound consideration that I
have brought myself to this decision. Mark, I pray you, that if this
seems an extraordinary resolu- tion, my situation is still more so. The
distracted life I have been made to lead for several years without
intermission would be terrible for a man in full health; judge what it
must be for a miserable invalid worn down with weariness and misfortune,
and who has now no wish but to die in peace. 93</p>
<p>The answer from Bern was an order to leave the island, and all
Bernese terri- tory, within twenty-four hours. 94</p>
<p>Where should he go? He had invitations to Potsdam from Frederick, to
Corsica from Paoli, to Lorraine from Saint-Lambert, to Amsterdam from
Rey the publisher, and to England from David Hume. On October 22 Hume,
then secretary to the British embassy in Paris, wrote to Rousseau:</p>
<p>Your singular and unheard-of misfortunes, independent of your virtue
and genius, must interest the sentiments of every human creature in your
favor; but I flatter myself that in England you could find an absolute
security against all persecution, not only from the tolerating spirit of
our laws, but from the re- spect which everyone there bears to your
character. 95</p>
<p>On October 29 Rousseau left the lie de St. -Pierre. He arranged for
The- rese to remain for the time being in Switzerland; he himself moved
on to Strasbourg. There he stayed a full month, hesitating. Finally he
decided to accept Hume’s invitation to England. The French government
gave him a passport to come to Paris. There Hume met him for the first
time, and soon became fond of him. All Paris ta lked about the exile’s
return. “It is impos - sible,” wrote Hume, “to express or imagine the
enthusiasm of this nation in Rousseau’s favor…. No person ever so much
enjoyed their attention…. Voltaire and everybody else are quite
eclipsed.” 96</p>
<p>The new friendship was flawed at its birth. It is difficult here to
determine the facts with accuracy, or to report them impartially. On
January 1, 1766, Grimm sent to his clientele the following report:</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau made his entry into Paris on the 17th of
December. The following day he promenaded in the Luxembourg Gardens in
his Armenian</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>costume; as no one had been warned, no one profited by the spectacle.
M. le Prince de Conti has lodged him in the Temple, where the said
Armenian holds his court daily. He also promenades daily at an appointed
hour on the boule- vards near his residence.*… Here is a letter that
went the rounds of Paris during his stay here, and which has had a great
success. 98</p>
<p>At this point Grimm transcribed a letter purporting to have come to
Rous- seau from Frederick the Great. It had been composed as a hoax on
Rousseau by Horace Walpole. Let Walpole himself tell of it in his letter
to H. S. Con- way, January 12, 1766:</p>
<p>My present fame is owing to a very trifling composition, but which
has made incredible noise. I was one evening at Mme. Geoffrin’s joking
on Rousseau’s affectations and contradictions, and said some things that
diverted them. When I came home I put them in a letter, and showed it
next day to Helvetius and the Due de Nivernois; who were so pleased with
it that, after telling me some faults in the language,… they encouraged
me to let it be seen. As you know, I willingly laugh at mountebanks,
political or literary, let their talents be ever so great; I was not
averse. The copies have spread like wildfire, et me void a la mode [and
behold, I am in fashion]… Here is the letter [literally translated from
Walpole’s French]:</p>
<p>“The King of Prussia to M. Rousseau: My dear Jean - Jacques:</p>
<p>You have renounced Geneva, your fatherland; you have had yourself
chased from Switzerland, a country so much praised in your writings;
France has issued a warrant against you. Come, then, to me; I admire
your talents; I am amused by your dreams, which (be it said in passing)
occupy you too much and too long. You must at last be wise and happy.
You have had yourself talked of enough for peculiarities hardly fitting
to a truly great man. Show your enemies that you can sometimes have
common sense; this will annoy them without doing you harm. My states
offer you a peaceful retreat; I wish you well, and would like to help
you if you can find it good. But if you continue to reject my aid, be
assured that I shall tell no one. If you persist in racking your brains
to find new misfortunes, choose such as you may desire; I am king, and
can procure any to suit your wishes; and — what surely will never happen
to you among your enemies — I shall cease to persecute you when you
cease to find your glory in being persecuted.</p>
<p>Your good friend,</p>
<p>Frederick.” 99</p>
<p>Walpole had never met Rousseau. His sophisticated intellect and
inherited fortune found no sense in Jean- Jacques’ writings. He knew of
Rousseau’s faults and follies from the dinners at Mme. Geoffrin’s, where
he met Diderot</p>
<p>Did Hume know of this letter? Apparently he had been present at Mme.
Geoffrin’s when it was first concocted; he has been accused of “taking
part”</p>
<ul>
<li>Cf. Rousseau to his friend de Luze: “I wish I could go and see you,
but in order not to</li>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>in its composition. 101 He wrote to the Marquise de Brabantane on
February 16, 1766: “The only pleasantry I permitted myself in connection
with the pretended letter of the King of Prussia was made by me at the
dinner table of Lord Ossory.” 102 On January 3, 1766, Hume made a
farewell vi sit to the diners at Baron d’Holbach’s. He told them of his
hopes to free “the little man” from persecution, and to make him happy
in England. D’Holbach was skeptical. “I am sorry,” he said, “to dispel
the hopes and illusions that flatter you, but I tell you it will not be
long before you are grievously undeceived. You don’t know your man. I
tell you plainly, you’re warming a viper in your bosom.” 103</p>
<p>The next morning Hume and Rousseau, with Jean-Jacques de Luze and
Rousseau’s dog Sultan, left Paris in two post chaises for Calais.
Rousseau paid his own expenses, having refused offers by Hume, Mme. de
Boufflers, and Mme. de Verdelin to supply him with funds. When they
reached Dover (January 10), Rousseau embraced Hume, and thanked him for
bringing him to a land of freedom.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>ROUSSEAU IN ENGLAND</li>
</ol>
<p>They arrived at London on January 13, 1766. Passers-by remarked Rous-
seau’s costume— fur cap, purple robe, and girdle; he explained to Hume
that</p>
<p>Altogether, Hume was thus far pleased with his guest. Soon after
reaching London he wrote to Mme. de Brabantane:</p>
<p>You have asked me my opinion of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After having
watched him in every aspect,… I declare that I have never known a man
more amiable and virtuous. He is gentle, modest, affectionate,
disinterested, of exquisite sensitivity. Seeking faults in him, I find
none but extreme impatience, and a disposition to nurse unjust
suspicions against his best friends… As for me, I would pass my life in
his company without a cloud arising between us. There is in his manners
a remarkable simplicity. In ordinary affairs he is a veritable child.
This makes it easy… for those who live with him to govern him. 106</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>He has an excellent warm heart, and in conversation kindles often to
a degree of heat which looks like inspiration. I love him much, and hope
to have some share in his affections…. The philosophers of Paris
foretold to me that I could not conduct him to Calais without a quarrel;
but I think I could live with him all my life in mutual friendship and
esteem. I believe one great source of our concord is that neither he nor
I are disputatious, which is not the case with any of them. They are
also displeased with him because they think he overabounds in religion;
and it is indeed remarkable that the philosopher of this age who has
been most persecuted is by far the most devout. 107… He has a hankering
after the Bible, and is indeed little better than a Christian. 108</p>
<p>But there were difficulties. As in Paris, so in London, lords,
ladies, authors, commoners flocked to the house of Mrs. Adams, in
Buckingham Street, where Rousseau had been lodged by Hume. Soon he
wearied of these atten- tions, and begged Hume to find him a home away
from London. An offer came to take care of him in a Welsh monastery; he
wished to accept it, but Hume prevailed upon him to board with a grocer
at Chiswick on the Thames, six miles from London. Thither Rousseau and
Sultan moved on January 28. Now he sent for Therese, and troubled his
host and Hume by insisting that she should be allowed to sit at table
with him. Hume com- plained in a letter to Mme. de Boufflers:</p>
<p>M. de Luze… says that she passes for wicked and quarrelsome and tat-
tling, and is thought to be the chief cause of his quitting Neuchatel
[Motiers]. He himself owns her to be so dull that she never knows in
what year of the Lord she is, nor in what month of the year, nor in what
day of the month or week; and that she can never learn the different
values of the pieces of money in any country. Yet she governs him as
absolutely as a nurse does a child. In her absence his dog has acquired
this ascendancy. His affection for that creature is beyond all
expression or conception. 109</p>
<p>Meanwhile Therese had come to Paris. Boswell met her there, and of-
fered to escort her to England. On February 12 Hume wrote to Mme. de
Boufflers: “A letter has come to me by w hich I learn that Mademoiselle
sets out post in company with a friend of mine, a young gentleman, very
good- humored, very agreeable, and very mad…. He has such a rage for
litera- ture that I dread some event fatal to our friend’s honor.” 110
Boswell claimed to have justified this premonition. According to pages,
now destroyed, 111 in his diary, he shared the same bed with Therese at
an inn on the second night out from Paris, and several nights
thereafter. They reached Dover early on February 11. The diary proceeds:
“Wednesday, 12 February: Yesterday morning had gone to bed very early,
and had done it once; thirteen in all. Was really affectionate to her.
At two [p.m.] set out on the fly.” That same evening he took Therese to
Hume in London, and promised her “not [to] mention affaire till after
her death, or that of the philosopher.” On the thirteenth he “delivered
her over” to Rousseau. “ Quanta oscula. He seemed so oldish and weak you
[Boswell] had no longer your enthusiasm for him.” 112 Naturally.</p>
<p>At Chiswick, as at Motiers, Rousseau received more mail than he
wished, and complained of the postage he had to pay. One day, when Hume
brought</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>21 I</p>
<p>him a “cargo” from London, he refused to take it, and bade him return
it to the post office. Hume warned him that in that case the postal
officials would open the rejected mail and learn his secrets. The
patient Scot offered to open such of Rousseau’s correspondence as came
to London, and to bring him only so much as seemed important.
Jean-Jacques agreed, but soon suspected Hume of tampering with his
mail.</p>
<p>Invitations to dinner, usually including Mile. Levasseur, came from
not- ables in London; Rousseau refused them on the score of ill health,
but prob- ably because he was loath to reveal Therese to elevated
company. He re- peatedly expressed a wish to retire farther into the
country. Hearing of this from Garrick, Richard Davenport offered him a
home at Wootton in Der- byshire, 150 miles from London. Rousseau
accepted gladly. Davenport sent a coach to transport him and Therese;
Rousseau complained that he was being treated like a beggar, and he
added to Hume: “If this be real ly a contrivance of Davenport’s you are
acquainted with it and consenting to it, and you could not possibly have
done me a greater displeasure.” An hour later (according to Hume),</p>
<p>he sat suddenly on my knee, threw his hands about my neck, kissed me
with the greatest warmth, and, bedewing all my face with tears,
exclaimed: “Is it possible you can ever forgive me, dear friend? After
all the testimonies of affection I have received from you, I reward you
at last with this folly and ill behavior. But I have, notwithstanding, a
heart worthy of your friendship; I love you, I esteem you; and not an
instance of your kindness is thrown away upon me.”… I kissed him and
embraced him twenty times, with a plenti - ful effusion of tears.
113</p>
<p>The next day, March 22, Jean-Jacques and Therese set off for Wootton,
and Hume never saw them again. Soon afterward Hume wrote to Hugh Blair a
perceptive analysis of Rousseau’s condition and character:</p>
<p>He was desperately resolved to rush into this solitude,
notwithstanding all my remonstrances; and I foresee that he will be
unhappy in that situation, as he has indeed been always in all
situations. He will be entirely without occupation, without company, and
almost without amusements of any kind. He has read very little in the
course of his life, and has now totally renounced all reading; he has
seen very little, and has no manner of curiosity to see or remark;… he
has not, indeed, much knowledge. He has only felt, during the whole
course of his life; and in this respect his sensibility rises to a pitch
beyond what I have seen any example of, but it still gives him a more
acute feeling of pain than of pleasure. He is like a man who were stript
not only of his clothes but of his skin, and turned out in that
situation to combat with the rude and boisterous elements, such as
perpetually disturb this lower world. 114</p>
<p>Rousseau and Therese arrived at Wootton on March 29. At first he was
well pleased with his new home. He described it in a letter to a friend
in Neuchatel: “A solitary house,… not very large but very suitable,
built halfway up the side of a valley”; before it “the loveliest lawn in
the universe,” and a landscape of “meadows, trees, or scattered farms,”
and, nearby, pleas - ant walks along a brook. “In the worst weather in
the world I go tranquilly botanizing.” 115 The Davenports occupied part
of the house on their infre -</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>quent stops there, and their servants remained to take care of the
philosopher and his “housekeeper.” Rousseau insisted on paying Davenport
thirty pounds a year for rent and service.</p>
<p>His happiness lasted a week. On April 3 a London journal, the
St. James Chronicle , published in French and English the supposed
letter of Frederick the Great to Rousseau, with no indication of the
real author. Jean-Jacques was deeply hurt when he learned of this, and
all the more when he found that the editor, William Strahan, had long
been a friend of Hume. Moreover, the tone of the British press toward
Rousseau had distinctly changed since his departure from Chiswick.
Articles critical of the eccentric philosopher multiplied; some
contained items which he thought only Hume knew and could have supplied;
in any case, he felt, Hume should have written some- thing in defense of
his former guest. He heard that the Scot was living in London in the
same house with Francois Tronchin, son of Jean- Jacques’ enemy in
Geneva; presumably Hume was now plentifully informed of Rousseau’s
faults.</p>
<p>On April 24 Rousseau wrote to the St. James Chronicle as follows:</p>
<p>You have offended, sir, against the respect which every private
person owes to a sovereign, by publicly attributing to the King of
Prussia a letter full of extravagance and spite, which consequently you
should have known could not have had this author. You have even ventured
to transcribe his signature, as though you have seen it written by his
hand. I inform you, sir, that this letter was fabricated in Paris; and
what grieves and tears my heart especially is that the impostor who
wrote it has accomplices in England. You owe it to the King of Prussia,
to the truth, and also to me, to print this letter, signed by me, in
reparation of an error which no doubt you would reproach yourself for
having committed, did you know of what a wicked design you have been
made the instrument. I offer you my sincere salutation.</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau 116</p>
<p>We can understand now why Rousseau thought there was a “conspiracy”
against him. Who but his old foes, Voltaire, Diderot, Grimm, and other
lanterns of the Enlightenment, could have engineered the sudden change
of tone in the British press from one of welcome and honor to one of
ridicule and belittlement? About this time Voltaire published,
anonymously, a Letter to Dr. /.-/. Pansophe, reproducing the unfavorable
references to the English people in Jean- Jacques’ writings— that they
were not really free, they cared too much for money, they were not
“naturally good.” The most damaging items in Voltaire’s pamphlet were
reprinted in a London periodical, Lloyd’s Evening News. 117</p>
<p>On May 9 Rousseau wrote to Conway asking that the pension offered him
be withheld for the time being. Hume urged him to accept it; Rousseau
re- plied that he could not accept any benefit obtained through Hume’s
media - tion. Hume demanded an explanation. Brooding in his isolation,
Rousseau seems now to have passed into a frenzy of suspicion and
resentment. On July 10 he sent Hume a letter of eighteen folio pages,
too long for total quotation, but so pivotal to a famous quarrel that
some central passages must be borne in mind:</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU OUTCAST</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>I am ill, sir, and little disposed for writing; but as you ask for an
explanation, it must be given you….</p>
<p>I live outside the world, and I remain ignorant of much that goes on
in it…. I only know what I feel….</p>
<p>You ask me, confidently, who is your accuser? Your accuser, sir, is
the one man in the whole world whom… I would believe: it is yourself….
Nam- ing David Hume as a third person, I will make you the judge of what
I ought to think of him.</p>
<p>Rousseau acknowledged at length Hume’s benefactions, but added:</p>
<p>As for the real good done me, these services are more apparent than
weighty…. I was not so absolutely unknown that, had I arrived alone, I
should have gone without help or counsel…. If Mr. Davenport has been
good enough to give me this habitation, it was not to oblige Mr. Hume,
whom he did not know…. All the good that has befallen me here would have
befallen me in much the same way without him [Hume]. But the evil that
has befallen me would not have happened. For why should I have any
enemies in England? And how and why does it happen that these enemies
are precisely Mr. Hume’s friends?…</p>
<p>I heard also that the son of the mountebank Tronchin, my most mortal
en- emy, was not only the friend but the protege of Mr. Hume, and that
they lodged together….</p>
<p>All these facts together made an impression upon me which rendered me
anxious…. At the same time the letters I wrote did not reach their
destina- tion; those I received had been opened; and all these had
passed through Mr. Hume’s hands….</p>
<p>But what became of me when 1 saw in the public press the pretended
letter from the King of Prussia?… A ray of light revealed to me the
secret cause of the astonishingly sudden change toward me in the
disposition of the British public; and I saw in Paris the center of the
plot which was being executed in London…. When this pretended letter was
published in London Mr. Hume, who certainly knew that it was fictitious,
said not one word, wrote to me nothing….</p>
<p>There remains only one word for me to say to you. If you are guilty,
do not write to me; it would be useless; be assured you would not
deceive me. But if you are innocent deign to justify yourself…. If you
are not — farewell for- ever. 118</p>
<p>Hume replied briefly (July 22, 1766), not meeting the charges, for he
had come to the conclusion that Rousseau was verging upon insanity. “If
I may venture to give my advice,” he wrote to Davenport, “it is that you
would continue the charitable work you have begun, till he be shut up
alto- gether in Bedlam.” 119 Hearing that Rousseau had denounced him in
letters to Paris (e.g., to the Comtesse de Boufflers, April 9, 1766), he
sent to Mme. de Boufflers a copy of Jean- Jacques’ long letter. She
replied to Hume:</p>
<p>Rousseau’s letter is atrocious; it is to the last degree extravagant
and inex - cusable…. But do not believe him capable of any falsehood or
artifice; nor imagine that he is either an impostor or a scoundrel. His
anger has no just cause, but it is sincere; of that I feel no doubt.</p>
<p>Here is what I imagine to be the cause of it. I have heard it said,
and he has perhaps been told, that one of the best phrases in
Mr. Walpole’s letter was by you, and that you had said in jest, speaking
in the name of the King of Prussia, “If you wish for persecutions, I am
a king, and can procure them for you of any sort you like,” and that
Mr. Walpole… had said y ou were its author. If</p>
<p>2I 4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>his be true, and Rousseau knows of it, do you wonder that, sensitive,
hot- headed, melancholy, and proud,… he has become enraged? 120</p>
<p>On July 2 6 Walpole wrote to Hume taking full blame — not expressing
any repentance — for the false letter, and condemning Rousseau’s
“ungrateful and wicked heart”; 121 but he did not deny that Hume had had
a hand in the letter. Hume wrote to d’Holbach, “ You are quite right;
Rousseau is a mon- ster,” and withdrew the kindly words he had formerly
used of Rousseau’s character. 122 When he learned from Davenport that
Jean-Jacques was writ- ing Confessions he assumed that Rousseau would
air his side of the affair. Adam Smith, Turgot, and Marischal Keith
advised Hume to bear the attack in silence, but the philosophes of
Paris, led by d’Alembert, urged him to pub - lish his own account of a
cause already celebre in two capitals. So he issued (October, 17 66) an
Expose succinct de la contestation qui s’est elevee entre M. Hume et M.
Rousseau, which had been put into French by d’Alembert and Suard; a
month later it appeared in English. Grimm gave its essence wide
circulation in his subscription letter of October 15, so that the
quarrel re- sounded in Geneva, Amsterdam, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. A
dozen pam- phlets redoubled the bruit. Walpole printed his version of
the dispute; Bos- well attacked Walpole; Mme. de La Tour’s Precis sur M.
Rousseau called Hume a traitor; Voltaire sent him additional material on
Rousseau’s faults and crimes, on his frequentation of “places of ill
fame,” and on his seditious activities in Switzerland. 123 George III
“followed the battle with intense curiosity.” 124 Hume sent the
pertinent documents to the British Museum. 125</p>
<p>Amid all this furor Rousseau maintained a somber silence. But he
resolved now to return to France at whatever risk and cost. The damp
climate of England, the reserve of the English character, depressed him;
the solitude he had sought was greater than he could bear. Having made
no attempt to learn English, he found it difficult to get along with the
servants. He could converse only with Therese — who daily pleaded with
him to take her to France. To further her plans she assured him that the
servants were planning to poison him. On April 30, 1767, he wrote to his
absent landlord,</p>
<p>Davenport:</p>
<p>Tomorrow, sir, I leave your house…. I am not unaware of the ambushes
which are laid for me, nor of my inability to protect myself; but, sir,
I have lived; it remains for me only to finish bravely a career passed

leave now; but I shall regret even more having had in you so agreeable a
host, and yet not having been able to make of him a friend. 126</p>

baggage behind, and money to pay for thirteen months’ lodging.

1 1 they turned up at Spalding in Lincolnshire. Thence they found their
way to Dover, and there, on May 22, they embarked for Calais, after
sixteen months in England. Hume wrote to Turgot and other friends, 127
asking them to help the outcast who, still tech- nically under warrant
of arrest, now returned desolate to France.</p>
