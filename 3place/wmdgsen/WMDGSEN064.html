<p>I. THE ENVIRONMENT OF GREECE</p>
<p>1 ET US take an atlas of the classic world* and find our way among
the neigh- j hors of ancient Greece. By Greece y or HellaSy we shall
mean all lands oc- cupied, in antiquity, by peoples speaking Greek.</p>
<p>We begin where many invaders entered — over the hills and through the
val- leys of Epirus. Here the ancestors of the Greeks must have tarried
many a year, for they set up at Dodona a shrine to their thundering
sky-god Zeus; as late as the fifth century the Greeks consulted the
oracle there, and read the divine will in the clangor of caldrons or the
rustling leaves of the sacred oak.^ Through southern Epirus flowed the
river Acheron, amid ravines so dark and deep that Greek poets s poke of
it as the portal or very scene of Hell. In Homer’s day the Epirots were
largely Greek in speech and ways; but then new waves of barbarism came
down upon them from the north, and dissuaded them from civilization.</p>
<p>Farther up the Adriatic lay Illyria, sparsely settled with untamed
herdsmen who sold cattle and slaves for salt.** On this coast, at
Epidamnus (the Roman Dyrrachium, now Durazzo), Caesar disembarked his
troops in pursuit of Pom- pey. Across the Adriatic the expanding Greeks
snatched the lower coasts from the native tribes, and gave civilization
to Italy. (In the end those native tribes would sweep back upon them,
and one tribe, almost barbarous till Alexander’s time, would swallow
them up, along with their motherland, in an unprecedented empire.)
Beyond the Alps ranged the Gauls, who were to prove very friendly to the
Greek city of Massalia (Marseilles); and at the western end of the
Mediterranean lay Spain, already half civilized and fully exploited by
the Phoenicians and Carthaginians when, about 550, the Greeks
established their timid colony at Emporium (Ampurias). On the coast of
Africa, menacingly opposite Sicily, was imperial Carthage, founded by
Dido and the Phoenicians, tradition said, in 813; no mere village, but a
city of 700,000 population, monopo- lizing the commerce of the western
Mediterranean, dominating Utica, Hippo, and three hundred other towns in
Africa, and controlling prosperous lands, mines, and colonies in Sicily,
Sardinia, and Spain. This fabulously wealthy metropolis was fated to
lead the Oriental thrust against Greece in the west, as Persia would
lead it in the east.</p>

</ul>
<p>67</p>
<p>68 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Farther east on the African coast lay the prosperous Greek city of
Gyrene, against a dark Libyan hinterland. Then Egypt. It was the belief
of most Greeks that many elements of their civilization had come to them
from Egypt; their legends ascribed the foundation of several Greek
cities to men who, like Cadmus and Danaus, had come from Egypt, or had
brought Egyptian culture to Greece by way of Phoenicia or Crete.® Under
the Saite kings (663-525) Egyptian commerce and art revived, and the
ports of the Nile were for the first time opened to Greek trade. From
the seventh century onward many famous Greeks — Thales, Pythagoras,
Solon, Plato, and Democritus may serve as examples — visited Egypt, and
were much impressed by the fullness and antiquity of its culture. Here
were no barbarians, but men who had had a mature civilization, and
highly developed arts, two thousand years before the fall of Troy. “You
Greeks,” said an Egyptian priest to Solon, “are mere children, talkative
and vain, and knowing nothing of the past.”* When Hecataeus of Miletu s
boasted to the Egyptian priests that he could trace his ancestry through
fifteen gen- erations to a god, they quietly showed him, in their
sanctuaries, the statues of 345 high priests, each the son of the
preceding, making 345 generations since the gods had reigned on earth.®
From the Egyptian cults of Isis and Osiris, in the belief of Greek
scholars like Herodotus and Plutarch, came the Orphic doctrine of a
judgment after death, and the resurrection ritual of Demeter and
Persephone at Eleusis.® Probably in Egypt, Thales of Miletus learned
geometry, and Rhoecus and Theodorus of Samos picked up the art of hollow
casting in bronze; in Egypt the Greeks acquired new skills in pottery,
textiles, metalwork- ing, and ivory;’ there, as well as from the A
ssyrians, Phoenicians, and Hittites, Greek sculptors took the style of
their early statues — flat-faced, slant-eyed, closefisted,
straight-limbed, stiff;* in the colonnades of Sakkara and Beni-Hasan, as
well as in the remains of Mycenaean Greece, Greek architects found part
of their inspiration for the fluted column and the Doric style.® And as
Greece in its youth learned humbly from Egypt, so, when it was
exhausted, it died, one might say, in the arms of Egypt; at AJexandria
it merged its philosophies , its rites, and its gods with those of Egypt
and Judea, in order that they might find a resurrected life in Rome and
Oiristianity.</p>
<p>Second only to Egypt’s was the influence of Phoenicia. The
enterprising merchants of Tyre and Sidon acted like a circulating medium
in the transmis- sion of culture, and stimulated every Mediterranean
region with the sciences, techniques, arts, and cults of Egypt and the
Near East. They excelled and perhaps instructed the Greeks in the
building of ships; they taught them better methods in metalworking,
textiles, and dyes;® they played a part, with Crete and Asia Minor, in
passing on to Greece the Semitic form of the alphabet that had been
developed in Egypt, Crete, and Syria. Farther east, Babylonia gave</p>

<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>o the Greeks its system of weights and measures its water clock and
sun* dial,“ its monetary units of obol, mina, and talent, “ its
astronomical principles, instruments, records, and calculations, its
sexagesimal system of dividing the year, the circle^ and the four right
angles that are subtended by a circle at its center, into 360 parts,
each of the 360 degrees into 60 minutes, and each of the minutes into 60
seconds; it was presumably his acquaintance with Egyptian and Babylonian
astronomy that enabled Thales to predict an eclipse of the sun.“
Probably from Babylonia came Hesiod’s notion of Chaos as the or igin of
all things; and the story of Ishtar and Tammuz is suspiciously like
those of Aphro^ dite and Adonis, Demeter and Persephone.</p>
<p>Near the eastern end of the commercial complex that united the
classic world lay the final enemy of Greece. In some ways — though few —
the civilization of Persia was superior to that of contemporary Hellas;
it produced a type of gentle- man finer than the Greek in every respect
except that of intellectual keenness and education, and a system of
impend administration that easily excelled the clumsy hegemonies of
Athens and Sparta, and lacked only the Greek passion for liberty. — From
Assyria the Ionian Greeks took a measure of skill in animal statuary, a
certain thickness of figure and flatness of drapery in their early
sculp- ture, many decorative motives in friezes and moldings, and
occasiondly a style of relief, as in the lovely stela of Aristion.’’* —
Lydia maintained intimate relations with Ionia, and its brilliant
capital, Sardis, was a clearinghouse for the traflSc in goods and ideas
between Mesopotamia and the Greek cities on the coast. The necessities
of an extensive trade stimulated banking, and caused the Lydian
government, about 680, to issue a state-guaranteed coinage. This boon to
trade was soon imitated and improved by the Greeks, and had effects as
momentous and interminable as those that came from the introduction of
the alphabet. — The influence of Phrygia was older and subtler. Its
mother goddess, Cybele, entered directly and deviously into Greek
religion, and its orgiastic flute music became that “Phrygian mode” so
popular among the populace, and so dis - turbing to the moralists, of
Greece. From Phrygia this wild music crossed the Hellespont into Thrace,
and served the rites of Dionysus. The god of wine was the chief gift of
Thrace to Greece; but one Thracian city, Hellenized Abdera, sought to
even the balance by giving Greece three philosophers — Leucippus,
Democritus and Protagoras. It was from Thrace that the cult of the Muses
passed down into Hellas; and the half-legendary founders of Greek music
— Orpheus, Musaeus, and Thamyris — were Thracian singers and bards.</p>
<p>From Thrace we move southward into Macedonia, and our cultural
circum- vallation of Greece is complete. It is a picturesque land, with
a soil once rich in minerals, plains fertile in grain and fruit, and
mountains disciplining a hardy stock that was destined to conquer
Greece. The mountaineers and peasants were of mixed race, predominantly
Illyrian and Thracian; perhaps they were</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>akin to the Dorians who conquered the Peloponnesus. The ruling
aristocracy claimed Hellenic lineage (from Heracles himself), and spoke
a dialect of Greek. The earlier capital, Edessa, stood on a vast plateau
between the plains that stretched to Epirus and the ranges that reached
to the Aegean. Farther east lay Pella, capital-to-be of Philip and
Alexander; and near the sea was Pydna, where the Romans would conquer
the conquering Macedonians, and win the right to transmit Greek
civilization to the Western world.</p>
<p>This, then, was the environment of Greece: civilizations like
Egypt,</p>
<p>Crete, and Mesopotamia that gave it those elements of technology,
science, and art which it would transform into the brightest picture in
history; empires like Persia and Carthage that would feel the challenge
of Greek commerce, and would unite in a war to crush Greece between them
into a harmless vassalage; and, in the north, warlike hordes recklessly
breeding, restlessly marching, who would sooner or later pour down over
the moun- tain barriers and do what the Dorians had done — break through
what Cicero was to call the Greek border woven on the barbarian robe,“
and destroy a civilization that they could not understand. Hardly any of
these surrounding nations cared for what to the Greeks was the very
essence of life — liberty to be, to think, to speak, and to do. Every
one of these peoples except the Phoenicians lived under despots,
surrendered their souls to super- stition, and had small experience of
the stimulus of freedom or the life of reason. That was why the Greeks
called them all, too indiscriminately, barbaroi, barbarians; a barbarian
was a man content to believe without rea- son and to live without
liberty. In the end the two conceptions of life — the mysticism of the
East and the rationalism of the West — would fight for the body and soul
of Greece. Rationalism would win under Pericles, as under Caesar, Leo X,
and Frederick; but mysticism would always return. The alternate
victories of these complementary philosophies in the vast pendulum of
history constitute the essential biography of Western civiliza-
tion.</p>

<li>ARGOS</li>
</ol>
<p>Within this circle of nations little Greece expanded until its
progeny peopled nearly every Mediterranean shore. For the gaunt hand
that stretched its skeletal fingers southward into the sea was but a
small part of the Greece whose history concerns us. In the course of
their development the irrepressible Hellenes spread into every isle of
the Aegean, into Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus, into Egypt, Palestine,
Syria, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor, into the Sea of Marmora and the
Black Sea, into the shores and</p>
<p>SPARTA</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>7*</p>
<p>peninsulas of the north Aegean, into Italy, Gaul, Spain, Sicily, and
northern Africa. In all these regions they built city-states,
independent and diverse, and yet Greek; they spoke the Greek tongue,
worshiped Greek gods, read and wrote Greek literature, contributed to
Greek science and philosophy, and practiced democracy in the Greek
aristocratic way. They did not leave Greece behind them when they
migrated from their motherland, they carried it with them, even the very
soil of it, wherever they went. For nearly a thousand years they made
the Mediterranean a Greek lake, and the center of the world.</p>
<p>The most discouraging task faced by the historian of classic
civilization is that of weaving into one pattern and story these
scattered members of the body of Greece.* We shall attempt it by the
pleasant method of a tour: with a map at our elbow and no expenditure
but of the imagination, we shall pass from city to city of the Greek
world, and observe in each center the life of the people before the
Persian war — the modes of economy and government, the activities of
scientists and philosophers, the achievements of poetry, and the
creations of art.f The plan has many faults: the geo- graphical sequence
will not quite agree with the historical; we shall be leaping from
century to century as well as from isle to isle; and we shall find
ourselves talking with Thales and Anaximander before listening to Homer
and Hesiod. But it will do us no harm to see the irreverent Iliad
against its actual background of Ionian skepticism, or to hear Hesiod’ s
dour plaints after visiting the Aeolian colonies from which his harassed
father came. When at last we reach Athens we shall know in some measure
the rich variety of the civilization that it inherited, and which it
preserved so bravely at Marathon.</p>
<p>If we begin at Argos, where the victorious Dorians established their
govern- ment, we find ourselves in a scene characteristically Greek: a
not too fertile plain, a small and huddled city of litde
brick-and-plaster houses, a temple on the acropolis, an open-air theater
on the slope of the hill, a modest palace here and there, narrow alleys
and unpaved streets, and in the distance die inviting and merciless sea.
For Hellas is composed of mountains and ocean; majesdc scenery is so
usual there that the Greeks, though moved and inspired by it, seldom
mention it in their books. The winter is wet and cold, the summer hot
and dry; sowing is in our autumn, reaping is in our spring; rain is a
heavenly</p>
<p>• “To write the history of Greece at almost any period without
dissipating the interest is a task of immense difficulty… because there
is no constant unity or fixed center to which the actions and aims of
the numerous states can be subordinated or related.”— Bury, Ancient
Greek Historians, p. 22.</p>
<p>To avoid returning too often to the same scene, the architectural
history of minor cities will be carried in these chapters (Book ii) down
to the death of Alexander (32}).</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>blessing, and Zeus the Rain Maker is god of gods. The rivers are
short and shallow, torrents for a winter spell, d^ smooth pebbles in the
summer heat. There were a hundred cities like Argos in the gamut of
Greece, a thousand like it but smaller; each of them jealously
sovereign, separated from the rest by Greek pugnaci^, or dangerous
waters, or roadless hills.</p>
<p>The Argives ascribed the foundation of their city to Pelasgic Argus,
the hero with a hundred eyes; and its first flourishing to an Egyptian,
Danaus, who came at the head of a ba nd of “Danaae” and taught the
natives to irrigate their fields with wells. Such eponyms are not to be
scorned; the Greeks preferred to end with myth that infinite regress
which we must end with mystery. Under Temenus, one of the returning
Heracleidae, Argos grew into the most power- ful city of Greece,
bringing Tiryns, Mycenae, and all Argolis under its sway. Towards 680
the government was seized by one of those tyrannoi, or dictators, who
for the next two centuries became the fashion in the larger cities of
Greece. Presumably Pheidon, like his fellow dictators, led the rising
merchant class- allied in a passing marriage of convenience with the
commoners — against a land- owning aristocracy. When Aegina was
threatened by Epidaurus and Athens Pheidon went to its rescue and took
it for himself. He adopted — probably from the Phoenicians — the
Babylonian system of weights and measures, and the t/ydian plan of a
currency guaranteed by the «tate; he established his mint on Aegina, and
the Aeginetan “tortoises” (coins marked with the island’s symbol) became
the first official coinage in continental Greece.”</p>
<p>Pheidon’s enlightened despotism opened a period of prosperity that
brought many arts to Argolis. In the sixth century the musicians of
Argos were the most famous in Hellas;” Lasus of Hermione won high place
among the lyric poets of his time, and taught his skill to Pindar; the
foundations were laid of that Argive school of sculpture which was to
give Polycleitus and its canon to Greece; drama found a home here, in a
theater with twenty thousand seats; and architects raised a majestic
temple to Hera, beloved and especially wor- shiped by Argos as the
goddess- bride who renewed her virginity every year.” But the
degeneration of Pheidon’s descendan ts — the nemesis of monarchy — and a
long series of wars with Sparta weakened Argos, and forced it at last to
yield to the Lacedaemonians the leadership of the Peloponnesus. Today it
is a quiet town, lost amid its surrounding fields; remembering vaguely
the glories of its past, and proud riiat in all its long history it has
never been abandoned.</p>
<p>HI. LACXINIA</p>
<p>South of Argos, and away from the sea, rise the peaks of the Pamon
range. They are beautiful, but still more pleasing to the eye is the
Eurotas River that runs between them and the taller, darker, snow-tipped
range of Taygetus on the west. In that seismic valley lay Homer’s
“hollow</p>
<p>SPARTA</p>
<p>caiAP.iv)</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>Lacedaemon,” a plain so guarded by mountains that Sparta, its
capital, needed no walls. At its zenith Sparta (“The Scattered”) was a
union of five villages, totaling some seventy thousand population. Today
it is a hamlet of four thousand souls; and hardly anything remains, even
in the modest museum, of the city that once ruled and ruined Greece.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Expansion of Sparta</li>
</ol>
<p>From that natural citadel the Dorians dominated and enslaved the
south- ern Peloponnesus. To these long-haired northerners, hardened by
moun- tains and habituated to war, there seemed no alternative in life
but con- quest or slavery; war was their business, by which they made
what seemed to them an honest living; the non-Dorian natives, weakened
by agriculture and peace, were in obvious need of masters. So the king s
of Sparta, who claimed a continuous lineage from the Heracleidae of
1104, first subjected the indigenous population of Laconia, and then
attacked Messenia. That land, in the southwestern comer of the
Peloponnesus, was relatively level and fertile, and was tilled by
pacific tribes. We may read in Pausanias how the Messenian king,
Aristodemus, consulted the oracle at Delphi for ways to defeat the
Spartans; how Apollo bade him offer in sacrifice to the gods a virgin of
his own royal race; how he put to death his own daughter, and lost the
wa r.” (Perhaps he had been mistaken about his daughter.) Twff
generations later the brave Aristomenes led the Messenians in heroic
revolt- For nine years their cities bore up under attack and siege; but
in the end the Spartans had their way. The Messenians were subjected to
an annual tax of half their crops, and thousands of them were led away
to join the Helot serfs.</p>
<p>The picture that we are to form of Laconian society before Lycurgus
has, like some ancient paintings, three levels. Above is a master class
of Dorians, living for the most part in Sparta on the produce of fields
owned by them in the country and tilled for them by Helots. Socially
between, geographically surrounding, the masters and the Helots were the
Perioeci (“Dwellers Around”): fre emen living in a hundred villages in
the moun- tains or on the outskirts of Laconia, or engaged in trade or
industry in the towns; subject to taxation and military service, but
having no share in the government, and no right of intermarriage with
the ruling class. Low- est and most numerous of all were the Helots, so
named, according to Strabo, from the town of Helus, whose people had
been among the first to be enslaved by the Spartans.” By simple conquest
of the non -Dorian population or by importing prisoners of war, Sparta
had made Laconia a</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>land of some 224,000 Helots, 120,000 Perioeci, and 32,000 men, women,
and children of the citizen class.*”</p>
<p>The Helot had all the liberties of a medieval serf. He could marry
as</p>
<p>he pleased, breed without forethought, work the land in his own way,
and live in a village with his neighbors, undisturbed by the absentee
owner of his lot, so long as he remitted regularly to this owner the
rental fixed by the government. He was bound to the soU, but neither he
nor the land could be sold. In some cases he was a domestic servant in
the town. He was expected to attend his master in war, and, when called
upon, to fight for the state; if he fought well he might receive his
freedom. His economic condition was not normally worse than that of the
village peasantry in the rest of Greece outside of Attica, or the
unskilled laborer in a modem city. He had the consolations of his own
dwelling, varied work, and the quiet friendliness of trees and fields.
But he was continually subject to martial law, and to secret supervision
by a secret police, by whom he might at any moment be killed without
cause or trial.”</p>
<p>In Laconia, as elsewhere, the simple paid tribute to the clever; this
is a custom with a venerable past and a promising future. In most
civilizations this distribution of the goods of life is brought about by
the normally peaceful operation of the price system: the clever persuade
us to pay more for the less readily duplicable luxuries and services
that they offer us than the simple can manage to secure for the more
easily replaceable necessaries that they produce. But in Laconia the
concentration of wealth was effected by irritatingly visible means, and
left among the Helots a volcanic dis- content that in almost every year
of Spartan history threatened to upset the state with revolution.</p>

<li>Spartct s Golden Age</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1-hat dim past before Lycurgus came, Sparta was a Greek city like
the rest, and blossomed out in song and art as it would never do ^ter
him. Music above aU was popular there, and rivaled man’s antiquity; for
as far back as we can delve we find the Greeks singing. In Sparta, so
frequently at war, music took a martial mm — the strong and simple
“Doric mode”; and not only were other styles discouraged, but any
deviation from this Doric style was punishable by law. Even Terpander,
though he had quelled a sedition by his songs, was fined by the ephors,
and his lyre nailed mute to the wall, because to suit his voice, he had
dared to add another string * These figures, of course, are conjectural,
being based upon a few hints and many assump-</p>

<p>o the instrument; and in a later generation Timotheus, who had
expanded T erpander’s seven strings to eleven, was not allowed to
compete at Sparta</p>
<p>Sparta, like England, had great composers when she imported them.
Towards 670, supposedly at the behest of the Delphic oracle, Terpander
was brought in from Lesbos to prepare a contest in choral singing at the
festival of the Carneia. Likewise Thaletas was summoned from Crete about
620; and soon after came Tyrtaeus, Aleman, and Polymnestus. Their labors
went mostly to composing patriotic music and training choruses to sing
it. Music was seldom taught to individual Spartans;” as in revolution -
ary Russia, the communal spirit was so strong that music took a
corporate form, and group competed with group in magnificent festivals
of song and dance. Such choral singing gave the Spartans another
opportunity for dis- cipline and mass formations, for every voice was
subject to the leader. At the feast of the Hyacinthia King Agesilaus
sang obediently in the place and time assigned to him by the choral
master; and at the festival of the Gymnopedia the whole body of
Spartans, of every age and sex, joined in massive exercises of
harmonious dance and antistrophal song. Such occa^ sions must have
provided a powerful stimulus and outlet to the patriotic sentiment.</p>
<p>Terpander (i.e., “Delighter of Men”) was one of those brilliant poet
- musicians w’;o inaugurated the great age of Lesbos in the generation
before Sappho. Tradition ascribed to him the invention of scolia or
drinking songs, and the expansion of the lyre from four to seven
strings; but the heptachord, as we have seen, was as old as Minos, and
presumably men had sung the glories of wine in the forgotten adolescence
of the world. Certainly he made a name for himself at Lesbos as a
kitharoedos — i.t., a com- poser and singer of musical lyrics. Having
killed a man in a brawl, he was exiled, and found it convenient to
accept an invitation from Sparta. There, it seems, he lived the
remainder of his days, teaching music and training choruses. We are told
that he ended his life at a drinking party: while he was singing —
perhaps that extra note which he had added at the top of the scale — one
of his auditors threw a fig at him; which, entering his mouth and his
windpipe, choked him to death in the very ecstasy of song.”</p>
<p>Tyrtaeus continued Terpander’s work at Sparta during the Second Mes -
senian War. He came from Aphidna — possibly in Lacedaemon, probably in
Attica; certainly the Athenians had an old jokg about the Spartans, that
when the latter were losing the Second War they were saved by a lame
Attic schoolmaster, whose songs of battle woke up the dull Spartans, and
stirred them to victory.” Apparently he sang his own songs to the
flute</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>in public assembly, seeking to transform martial death into enviable
glory. “It is a fine thing,” says one of his surviving fragments, “for a
brave man to die in the front rank of those who fight for their
country…. Let each one, standing squarely on his feet, rooted to the
ground and biting his lips, keep firm…. Foot to foot, shield to shield,
waving plumes mingling and helmets clashing, let the warriors press
breast to breast, each sword and spear-point m eeting in the shock of
battle.”* Tyrtaeus, said the Spartan</p>
<p>Aleman sang in the same generation, as friend and rival of Tyrtaeus,
but in a more varied and earthly strain. He came from far-off Lydia, and
some said that he was a slave; nevertheless the Lacedaemonians welcomed
him, not having yet learned the xenelasia, or hatred of foreigners,
which was to become part of the Lycurgean code. The later Spartans would
have been scandalized at h is eulogies of love and food, and his roster
of Laconia’s noble wines. Tradition ranked him as the grossest eater of
antiquity, and as an insatiable pursuer of women. One of his songs told
how fortunate he was that he had not remained in Sardis, where he might
have become an emas- culate priest of Cybele, but had come to Sparta,
where he could love in freedom his golden- haired mistress
Megalostrata.” He begins for us that dynasty of amorous poets which
culminates in Anacreon, and he heads the list of the “Nine Lyric Poets”
chosen by Alexandrian critics as the best of ancient Greece.* He could
write hymns and paeans as well as songs of wine and love, and the
Spartans liked especially the parthenia, or maiden songs, which he
composed for choruses of girls. A fragment now and then reveals that
power of imaginative feeling which is the heart of poetry:</p>
<p>Asleep lie mountain-top and mountain-gully, shoulder also and</p>
<p>ravine; the creeping things that come from the dark earth, the beasts
that lie upon the hillside, the generation of the bees, the monsters</p>
<p>in the depths of the purple sea; all lie asleep, and with them
the</p>
<p>ribes of the winging birds.t“</p>
<p>• Aleman, Alcaeus, Sappho, Stesichorus, Ibycus, Anacreon, Simonides,
Pindar, Bacchylides.</p>
<p>How strangely similar this is — as if one feeling united two poets
across twenty-five cen turies — to Goedie’s “Wanderer’s Night -
Song”:</p>

<p>77</p>
<p>We may judge from these poets that the Spartans were not always Spar-
tans, and that in the century before Lycurgus they relished poetry and
the arts as keenly as any of the Greeks. The choral ode became so
closely associated with them that when the Athenian dramatists wrote
choral lyrics for their plays they used the Doric dialect, though they
wrote the dialogue in the Attic speech. It is hard to say what other
arts flourished in Lace- daemon in those halcyon days, for even the
Spartans neglected to preserve or record them. Laconian pottery and
bronze were famous in the seventh century, and the minor arts produced
many refinements for the life of the fortunate few. But this little
Renaissance was ended by the Messenian Wars. The conquered land was
divided among the Spartans, and the number of serfs was almost doubled.
How could thirty thousand citizens keep in lasting subjection four times
their number of Perioeci, and seven times their number of Helots? It
could be done only by abandoning the pursuit and patronage of the arts,
and turning every Spartan into a soldier ready at any moment to suppress
rebellion or wage war. The constitution of Lycurgus achieved this end,
but at the cost of withdrawing Sparta, in every sense but the political,
from the history of civilization.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Lycurgus</li>
</ol>
<p>Greek historians from Herodotus onward took it for granted that
Lycur- gus was the author of the Spartan code, just as they accepted as
historical the siege of Troy and the murder of Agamemnon. And as modem
scholar- ship for a century denied the existence of Troy and Agamemnon,
so today it hesitates to admit the reality of Lycurgus. The dates
assigned to him vary from 900 to 600 b.c.; and how could one man take
out of his head the most unpleasant and astonishing body of legislation
in all history, and impose it in a few years not only upon a subject
population but even upon a self- willed and warlike ruling class?”
Nevertheless it would be pre - sumptuous to reject on such theoretical
grounds a tradition accepted by all Greek historians. The seventh
century was peculiarly an age of per- sonal legislators — Zaleucus at
Locris (ca. 660), Draco at Athens (620), and Charondas at Sicilian
Catana (ca. 610) — not to speak of Josiah’s dis - covery of the Mosaic
code in the Temple at Jerusalem (ca. 621). Prob- ably we have in these
instances not so much a body of personal legislation as a set of customs
harmonized and clarified into specific laws, and named, for
convenience’s sake, from the man who codified them and in most cases</p>
<p>78 THELIFEOF GREECE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>gave them a written form.* We shall record the tradition, while
remem- bering that it has in all likelihood personified and
foreshortened a process of change, from cxistom to law, that required
many authors and many years.</p>
<p>According to Herodotus,“ Lycurgus, uncle and guardian of the Spartan
Kang Charilaus, received from the oracle at Delphi certain rhetra, or
edicts, which were described by some as the laws of Lycurgus themselves,
or by others as a divine sanction for the laws that he proposed.
Apparently the legislators felt that to alter certain customs, or to
establish new ones, the safest procedure would be to present their
proposals as commands of the god; it was not the first time that a state
had laid its foundations in the sky. Tradition further relates that
Lycurgus traveled in Crete, admired its insti- tutions, and resolved to
introduce some of them into Laconia.“ The kings and most of the nobles
grudgingly accepted his reforms as indispensable to their own security;
but a young aristocrat, Alcander, resisted violently, and struck out one
of the legislator’s eyes. Plutarch tells the story with his usual
simplicity and charm:</p>
<p>Lycurgus, so far from being daunted or discouraged by this acci-</p>
<p>dent, stopped short, and showed his disfigured face, and eye beaten
out, to his countrymen. They, dismayed and ashamed at the sight,</p>
<p>delivered Alcander into his hands to be punished…. Lycurgus, hav- ing
thanked them, dismissed them all, excepting only Alcander; and taking
him with him into his house, neither did nor said anything</p>
<p>severely to him, but… bade Alcander to wait upon him at table.</p>
<p>The young man, who was of an ingenuous temper, without murmiur- ing
did as he was commanded; and being thus admitted to live with Lycurgus,
he had an opportunity to observe in him, besides his gen- tleness and
calmness of temper, an extraordinary sobriety and an</p>
<p>indefatigable industry; and so, from being an enemy, became one</p>
<p>of his most zealous admirers, and told his friends and relations
that</p>
<p>he was not that morose and ill-natured man they had taken him for,
but the one mild and gentle character of the world.“</p>
<p>Having completed his legislation, Lycurgus (says a probably legendary
coda to lus story) pledged the citizens not to change the laws till his
return. Then he went to Delphi, retired into seclusion, and starved
himself to death, “thinking it a statesman’s duty to make his very
death, if possible, an act of service to the state.”“</p>
<p>• Ly curgus, however, was believed to have forbidden the writing of
his laws.</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Lacedaemonian Constitution</li>
</ol>
<p>When we attempt to specify the reforms of Lycurgus the tradition be-
comes contradictory and confused. It is difficult to say which elements
of the Spartan code preceded Lycurgus, which were created by him or his
generation, and which were added after him. Plutarch and Polybius“
assure us that Lycurgus redistributed the land of Laconia into thirty
thou- sand equal shares among the citizens; Thucydides“ implies that
there was no such distribution. Perhaps old properties were left
untouched, while the newly conquered land was equally divided. Like
Cleisthenes of Sicyon and Cleisthenes of Athens, Lycurgus (viz., the
authors of the Lycurgean constitution) abolished the kinship
organization of Laconian society, and replaced it with geographical
divisions; in this way the power of the old families was broken, and a
wider aristocracy was formed. To prevent the displacement of this
landowning oligarchy by such mercantile classes as were gaining
leadership in Argos, Sicyon, Corinth, Megara, and Athens, Lycurgus
forbade the citizens to engage in industry or trade, prohibited the use
or importation of silver or gold, and decreed that only iron should be
used as currency. He was resolved that the Spartans (i.e., the landown-
ing citizens) should be left free for government and war.</p>
<p>It was a boast of ancient conservatives“ that the Lycurgean
constitution endured so long because the three forms of government —
monarchy, aris- tocracy, and democracy — were united in it, and in such
proportions that each element neutralized the others against excess.
Sparta’s monarchy was really a duarchy, since it had concurrently two
kings, descending from the invading Heraclids. Possibly this strange
institution was a compromise between two related and therefore rival
houses, or a device to secure without absolutism the psychological uses
of royalty in maintaining social order and national prestige. Their
powers were limited: they performed the sacrifices of the state
religion, headed the judiciary, and commanded the army in war. In all
matters they were subordinate to the Senate; and after Plataea they lost
more and more of their authority to the ephors.</p>
<p>The aristocratic and predominant element of the constitution resided
in the Senate, or gerousia, literally and actually a group of old men;
normally citizens under sixty were considered too immature for its
deliberations. Plutarch gives their number as twenty-eight, and tells an
incredible story of their election. When a vacancy occurred candidates
were required to pass silently and in turn before the Assembly; and he
who was greeted the loudest and longest shouts was pronounced elected.“
Perhaps this</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>was thought to be a realistic and economical abbreviation of the
fuller democratic process. We do not know which of the citizens were
ehgible to such election; presumably they were the homoioi, or equals,
who owned the soil of Laconia, had served in the army, and brought their
quota of food to the public mess.“ The Senate originated legislation,
acted as a supreme court in capital crimes, and formulated public
policy.</p>
<p>T he Assembly, or apella, was Sparta’s concession to democracy. Appar
- ently all male citizens were admitted to it upon reaching the age of
thirty; some eight thousand males were ehgible in a population of
376,000. It met on each day of the full moon. All matters of great
public moment were submitted to it, nor could any law be passed without
its consent. Few laws, however, were ever added to the Lycurgean
constitution; and these the Assembly might accept or reject, but not
discuss or amend. It was essentially the old Homeric pubhc meeting,
hstening in awe to the council of chiefs and elders, or to the
army-commanding kings. TheoreticaUy sov- ereignty resided in the apella;
but an amendment made to the constitution after Lycurgus empowered the
Senate, if it judged that the Assembly had decided “crookedly,” to
reverse the decision.“ When an advanced thinker asked Lycurgus to
establish a democracy Lycurgus replied, “Begin, my friend, by setting it
up in your own family.”“</p>
<p>Cicero compared the five ephors (i.e., overseers) to the Roman
tribunes, since they were chosen annually by the Assembly; but they
corresponded more to the Roman consuls, as wielding an administrative
power checked only by the protests of the Senate. The ephorate existed
before Lycurgus, and yet is not mentioned in such reports of his
legislation as have reached us. By the middle of the sixth century the
ephors had become equal in authority to the kings; after the Persian War
they were practically supreme. They received embassies, decided disputes
at law, commanded the armies, and directed, absolved, or punished the
kings.</p>
<p>The enforcement of the government’s decrees was entrusted to the army
and the police. It was the custom of the ephors to arm certain of the
younger Spartans as a special and secret police (the krypteia ) , with
the right to spy upon the people, and, in the case of Helots, to kill at
their discretion.“ This institution was used at unexpected times, even
to do away with Helots who, though they had served the state bravely in
war, were feared by the masters as able and therefore dangerous men.
After eight years of the Peloponnesian War, says the impartial
Thucydides,</p>
<p>he Helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of
their</p>
<p>number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against</p>
<p>SPARTA</p>
<p>8i</p>
<p>CHAP.IV)</p>
<p>he enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the object
being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim their
free- dom would be the most high-spirited and the most apt to rebel.</p>
<p>As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned</p>
<p>hemselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new free-
dom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them,</p>
<p>and no one ever knew how each of them perished.“</p>
<p>The power and pride of Sparta was above all in its army, for in
the</p>
<p>courage, discipline, and skill of these troops it found its security
and its ideal. Every citizen was trained for war, and was liable to
military service from his twentieth to his sixtieth year. Out of this
severe training came the hoplites of Sparta — those close-set companies
of heavy-armed, spear- hurling citizen infantry that were the terror
even of the Athenians, and remained practically undefeated until
Epaminondas overcame them at Leuctra. Around this army Sparta formed its
moral code: to be good was to be strong and brave; to die in battle was
the highest honor and happi- ness; to survive defeat was a disgrace that
even the soldier’s mother could hardly forgive. “Return with your shield
or on it,” was the Spartan</p>
<p>mother’s farewell to her soldier son. Flight with the heavy shield
was impossible.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The Spartan Code</li>
</ol>
<p>To train men to an ideal so unwelcome to the flesh it was necessary
to take them at birth and form them by the most rigorous discipline. The
first step was a ruthless eugenics: not only must every child face the
father’s right to infanticide, but it must also be brought before a
state</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>heir wives shut up, to be made mothers only by themselves, who might
be foolish, infirm, or diseased.” In the general opinion of antiquity
the Spartan males were stronger and handsomer, their women healthier and
lovelier, than the other Greeks.*</p>
<p>Probably more of this result was due to training than to eugenic
birth. Thucydides makes King Archidamus say: “There is little
difference” (at bir th, presumably) “between man and man, but the
superiority lies with him who is reared in the severest school.”* At the
age of seven the Spartan boy was taken from his family and brought up by
the state; he was en- rolled in what was at once a military regiment and
a scholastic class, under a paidonomos, or manager of boys. In each
class the ablest and bravest boy was made captain; the rest were
instructed to obey him, to submit to the punishments he might impose
upon them, and to strivfe to match or better him in achievement and
discipline. The aim was not, as at Athens, athletic form and skill, but
martial courage and worth. Games were played in the nude, under the eyes
of elders and lovers of either sex. The older men made it their concern
to provoke quarrels among the boys, individu- ally and in groups, so
that vigor and fortitude might be tested and trained; and any moment of
cowardice brought many days of disgrace. To bear pain, hardship, and
misfortune silently was required of all. Every year, at the altar of
Artemis Orthia, some chosen youths were scourged till their blood
stained the stones.* At twelve the boy was deprived of undercloth- ing,
and was allowed but one garment throughout the year. He did not bathe
frequently, like the lads of Athens, for water and unguents made the
body soft, while cold air and clean soil made it hard and resistant.
Winter and summer he slept in the open, on a bed of rushes broken from
the Eurotas’ banks. Until he was thirty he lived with his company in
bar- racks, and knew none of the comforts of home.</p>
<p>He was taught reading and writing, but barely enough to make him</p>
<p>literate; books found few buyers in Sparta,* and it was easy to keep
up with the publishers. Lycurgus, said Plutarch, wished children to
learn his laws not by writing but by oral transmission and youthful
practice under care- ful guidance and example; it was safer, he thought,
to make men good by unconscious habituation than to rely upon
theoretical persuasion; a proper education would be the best government.
But such education would have to be moral rather than mental; character
was more important than intel- lect. The young Spartan was trained to
sobriety, and some Helots were compelled to drink to excess in order
that the youth might see how foolish drunkenness can be.“ He was taught,
in preparation for war, to forage</p>
<p>SPARTA</p>
<p>CHAP.IV)</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>in the fields and find his own food, or starve; to steal in such
cases was per- missible, but to be detected was a crime punishable by
flogging.“ If he behaved well he was allowed to attend the public mess
of the citizens, and was expected to listen carefully there so that he
might become acquainted with the problems of the state, and learn the
art of genial conversation. At the age of thirty, if he had survived
with honor the hardships of youth, he was admitted to the full rights
and responsibilities of a citizen, and sat down to dine with his
elders.</p>
<p>The girl, though left to be brought up at home, was also subject to
regu- lation by the state. She was to engage in vigorous games —
running, wres- tling, throwing the quoit, casting the dart — in order
that she might become strong and healthy for easy and perfect
motherhood. She should go naked in public dances and processions, even
in the presence of young men, so that she might be stimulated to proper
care of her body, and her defects might be discovered and removed. “Nor
was there anything shameful in the nakedness of the young women,” says
the highly moral Plutarch; “mod - esty attended them, and all wantonness
was excluded.” While they danced they sang songs of praise for those
that had been brave in war, and heaped contumely upon those that had
given way. Mental education was not wasted upon the Spartan girl.</p>
<p>As to love, the young man was permitted to indulge in it without
preju- dice of gender. Nearly every lad had a lover among the older men;
from this lover he expected further education, and in return he offered
affection and obedience. Often this exchange grew into a passionate
friendship that stimulated both youth and man to bravery in war.“ Young
men were allowed considerable freedom before marriage, so that
prostitution was rare, and hetairai here found no encouragement.“ In all
of Lacedaemon we hear of only one temple to Aphrodite, and there the
goddess was repre- sented as veiled, armed with a sword, and bearing
fetters on her feet, as if to symbolize the foolishness of marrying for
love, the subordination of love to war, and the strict control of
marriage by the state.</p>
<p>The state specified the best age of marriage as thirty for men and
twenty for women. Celibacy in Sparta was a crime; bachelors were
excluded from the franchise, and from the siglw^f=public processions in
which young men and women danced in the nude. According to Plutarch the
bachelors them- selves were compelled to march in public, naked even in
winter, singing a song to the effect that they were justly suffering
this punishment for hav- ing disobeyed the laws. Persistent avoiders of
marriage might be set upon at any time in the streets by groups of
women, and be severely handled.</p>
<p>84 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Those who married and had no children were only less completely dis-
graced; and it was understood that men who were not fathers were not
entitled to the respect that the youth of Sparta religiously paid to
their elders.“</p>
<p>Marriages were usually arranged by the parents, without purchase; but
after this agreement the bridegroom was expected to carry off the bride
by force, and she was expected to resist; the word for marriage was
harpadzein, to seize.“ If such arrangements left some adults still
unmarried, several men might be pushed into a dark room with an equal
number of girls, and be left to pick their life mates in the darkness;“
the Spartans thought that such choosing would not be blinder than love.
It was usual for the bride to stay with her parents for a while; the
bridegroom remained in his barracks, and visited his wife only
clandestinely; “in this relation,” says Plutarch, “they lived a long
time, insomuch that they sometimes had children by their wives before
even they saw their faces by daylight.” When they were ready for
parentage custom allowed them to set up a home. Love came after mar-
riage rather than before, and marital affection appears to have been as
strong in Sparta as in any other civilization.“ The Spartans boasted
that there was no adultery among them, and they may have been right, for
there was much freedom before marriage, and many husbands could be
persuaded to share their wives, especially with brothers.“ Divorce was
rare. The Spartan general Lysander was punished because he left his wife
and wished to marry a prettier one.“</p>
<p>All in all,’ the position of woman was better in Sparta than in any
other Greek community. There more than elsewhere she preserved her high
Homeric status, and the privileges that survived from an early
matrilinear society. Spartan women, says Plutarch,“ “were bold and
masculine, over - bearing to their husbands… and speaking openly even on
the most im- portant subjects.” They could inherit and bequeath
property; and in the course of time — so great was their influence over
men — nearly half the real wealth of Sparta was in their hands.“ They
lived a life of luxury and liberty at home while the men bore the brunt
of frequent war, or dined on simple fare in the public mess.</p>
<p>For every Spartan male, by a characteristic ordinance of the
constitution, was required from his thirtieth to his sixtieth year to
eat his main meal daily in a public dining hall, where the food was
simple in quality and slightly but deliberately inadequate in amoimt. In
this way, says Plutarch,</p>
<p>SPARTA</p>
<p>CHAP.IV)</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>he legislator thought to harden them to the privations of war, and to
keep them from the degeneration of peace; they “should not spend their
lives at home, laid on costly couches at splenchd tables, delivering
themselves up to the hands of their tradesmen and cooks, to fatten them
in comers like greedy brutes, and to ruin not their minds only but their
very bodies, which, enfeebled by indulgence and excess, would stand in
need of long sleep, warm bathing, freedom from work, and, in a word, of
as much care and attendance as if they were co ntinually sick.”“ To
supply the food for this public meal each citizen was required to
contribute to his dining club, periodically, stated quantities of com
and. other provisions; if he failed in this his citizenship was
forfeited.</p>
<p>Normally, in the earlier centuries of the code, the simplicity and
asceti- cism to which Spartan youth was trained persisted into later
years. Fat men were a rarity in Lacedaemon; there was no law regulating
the size of the stomach, but if a man’s belly swelled indecently he
might be publicly reproved by the government, or banished from Laconia.“
There was little of the drinking and the revelry that flourished in
Athens. Differences of wealth were real, but hidden; rich and poor wore
the same simple dress — a woolen peplos, or shirt, that hung straight
from the shoulders without pretense to beauty or form. The accumulation
of movable riches was diffi- cult; to lay up a hundred dollars’ worth of
iron currency required a large closet, and to remove it, nothing less
than a yoke of oxen.“ Human greed remained, however, and found an outlet
in official corraption. Senators, ephors, envoys, generals, and kings
were alike purchasable, at prices befit- ting their dignity.“ When an
ambassador from Samos displayed his gold plate at Sparta, King Cleomenes
I had him recalled lest the citizens be spoiled by alien example.“</p>
<p>The Spartan system, fearful of such contamination, was inhospitable
beyond precedent. Foreigners were rarely welcomed. UsuaUy they were made
to understand that their visits must be brief; if they stayed too long
they were escorted to the frontier by the police. The Spartans
themselves were forbidden to go abroad without permission of the
government, and to dull their curiosity they were trained to a haughty
exclusiveness that would not dream that other nations could teach them
anything.“ The sys- tem had to be ungracious in order to protect itself;
a breath from that excluded world of freedom, luxury, letters, and arts
might topple over this strange and artificial society, in which two

<li>An Estimate oj Sparta</li>
</ol>
<p>What type of man, and what kind of civilization, did this code
produce? First of all, a man of strong body, at home with hardship and
privation. A luxury- loving Sybarite remarked of the Spartans that “it
was no com - mendable thing in them to be so ready to die in the wars,
since by that they were freed from much hard labor and mise rable
living.”” Health was one of the cardinal virtues in Sparta, and sickness
was a crime; Plato’s heart</p>
<p>If it be a virtue to obey the laws, the Spartan was virtuous beyond
most men. “Though the Lacedaemonians are free,” the ex -king Demaratus
told Xerxes, “yet they are not free in all things; for over them is set
law as a master, whom they fear much more than thy people fear thee.””
Sel - dom — probably never again except in Rome and medieval Jewry — has
a peo- ple been so strengthened by reverence for its laws. Under the
Lycurgean constitution Sparta, for at least two centuries, became always
stronger. Though it failed to conquer Argos or Arcadia, it persuaded all
the Pelo- ponnesus except Argos and Achaea to accept its leadership in a
Peloponne- sian League that for almost two hundred years (560-380) kept
the peace in Pelops’ isle. All Greece admired Sparta’s army and
government, and</p>
<p>looked to it for aid in deposing burdensome tyrannies. Xenophon tells
of “the astonishment with which I first noted the unique position of
Sparta</p>
<p>SPARTA</p>
<p>CHAP.IV)</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Here it was, of course, that Plato found the outlines of his utopia,
a little blurred by a strange indifference to Ideas. Weary and fearful
of the vul- garity and chaos of democracy, many Greek thinkers took
refuge in an idolatry of Spartan order and law.</p>
<p>They could afford to praise Sparta, since they did not have to live
in it. They did not feel at close range the selfishness, coldness, and
cruelty of the Spartan character; they could not see from the select
gentlemen whom they met, or the heroes whom they commemorated from afar,
that the Spartan code produced good soldiers and nothing more; that it
made vigor of body a graceless brutality because it killed nearly all
capacity for the things of the mind. With the triumph of the code the
arts that had flour- ished before its establishment died a sudden death;
we hear of no more poets, sculptors, or builders in Sparta after 550.*
Only choral dance and music remained, for there Spartan discipline could
shine, and the individ- ual could be lost in the mass. Excluded from
commerce with the world, barred from travel, ignorant of the science,
the literature, and the philoso- phy of exuberantly growing Greece, the
Spartans became a nation of excel- lent hoplites, with the mentality of
a lifelong infantryman. Greek travelers marveled at a life so simple and
unadorned, a franchise so jealously con- fined, a conservatism so
tenacious of every custom and superstition, a cour- age and discipline
so exalted and limited, so noble in character, so base in purpose, and
so barren in result; while, hardly a day’s ride away, the Athe - nians
were building, out of a thousand injustices and errors, a civilization
broad in scope and yet intense in action, open to every new idea and
eager for intercourse with the world, tolerant, varied, complex,
luxurious, inno- vating, skeptical, imaginative, poetical, turbulent,
free. It was a contrast that would color and almost delineate Greek
history.</p>
<p>In the end Sparta’s narrowness of spirit betrayed even her strength
of soul. She descended to the sanctioning of any means to gain a Spartan
aim; at last she stooped so far to conquer as to sell to Persia the
liberties that Athens had won for Greece at Marathon. Militarism
absorbed her, and made her, once so honored, the hated terror of her
neighbors. When she fell, all the nations marveled, but none mourned.
Today, among the scanty ruins of that ancient capital, hardly a torso or
a fallen pillar sur- vives to declare that here there once lived
Greeks.</p>

<p>Northward from Sparta the valley of the Eurotas reaches across the
frontier of Laconia into the massed mountains of Arcadia. They would be
more beautiful if they were not so dangerous. They have not welcomed the
narrow roads cut out of their rock slopes, and seem to threaten gloom-
ily all disturbers of these Arcadian retreats. No wonder the conquering
Dorians and Spartans were both baffled here, and left Arcadia, like Elis
and Achaea, to the Achaean and Pelasgian stocks. Now and then the trav-
eler comes upon a plain or a plateau, and finds flourishing new towns
like Tripolis, or the remains of ancient cities like Orchomenos,
Megalopolis, Tegea, and Mantinea, where Epaminondas won both victory and
death. But for the most part it is a land of scattered peasants and
shepherds, living precariously with their flocks in these grudging
lulls; and though after Marathon the cities awoke to civilization and
art, they hardly enter the story before the Persian War. Here in these
perpendicular forests once roamed the great god Pan,</p>
<p>In southern Arcadia the Eurotas almost meets a yet more famous river.
Swiftly the Alpheus wears its way through the Parrhasian range, meanders
leisurely into the plains of Elis, and leads the traveler to Olympia.
The Elians, Pausanias tells us,” were of Aeolic or Pelasgic origin, and
came from Aetolia across the bay. Their first king, Aethlius, was father
of that Endymion whose beauty so allured the moon that she closed his
eyes in a perpetual sleep, siimed at leisure, and had by him half a
hundred daugh- ters. Here, where the Alpheus joins the Cladeus flowing
from the north, was the holy city of the Greek world, so sacred that war
seldom disturbed it, and the Elians had the boon of a history in which
battles were replaced by games. In the angle of the merging streams was
the Altis, or hallowed precinct, of Olympian Zeus. Wave after wave of
invaders stopped here to worship him; periodically, in later days, their
delegates returned to be- seech his help and enrich his fane; from
generation to generation the tem- ples of Zeus and Hera grew in wealth
and renown, until the greatest archi- tects and sculptors of Greece were
brought together, after the triumph over Persia, to restore and adorn
them in lavish gratitude. The shrine of Hera went back to looo b.c.; its
ruins are the oldest temple remains in Greece. Fragments of thirty-six
columns and twenty Doric capitals sur- vive to show how often and how
variously the pillars were replaced. Orig- inally, no doubt, they were
of wood; and one shaft of oak still stood when Pausanias came there,
notebook in hand, in the days of the Antonines.</p>

<p>From Olympia one passes by the site of the ancient capital, Elis,
into Achaea. Hither some of the Achaeans fled when the Dorians took
Argos and Mycenae. Like Arcadia it is a land of mountains, along whose
slopes patient shepherds drive their flocks up or down as the seasons
change. On the western coast is the still-thriving port of Patras, of
whose women Pausanias said that they were “twice as numerous as the men,
and devoted to Aphrodite if any women are.”” Other cities huddled
against the hills along the Corinthian Gulf— Aegium, Helice, Aegira,
Pellene — now almost forgotten, but once alive with men, women, and
children, every one of whom was the center of the world.</p>
<p>V. CORINTH</p>
<p>A few more mountains, and the traveler re-enters, in Sicyon, the area
of Dorian settlement. Here, in 676, one Orthagoras taught the world a
trick of politics that aftercenturies would use. He explained to the
peasants that they were of Pelasgic or Achaean stock, while the
landowning aristocracy that exploited them was descended from Dorian
invaders; he appealed to the racial pride of the dispossessed, led them
in a successful revolution, made himself dictator, and established the
manufacturing and trading classes in power.* Under his able successors,
Myron and Qeisthenes, these classes made Sicyon a semi-industrial city,
famous for its shoes and its pottery, though still named from the
cucumbers that it grew.</p>
<p>Farther east is the city that should have been, by all geographic and
economic omens, the richest and most cultured center in Greece. For
Corinth, on the isthmus, had an enviable position. It could lock the
land door to or upon the Peloponnesus; it could serve and mulct the
overland trade between northern and southern Greece; and it had harbors
and ship- ping on both the Saronic and the Corinthian Gulf. Between
these seas it built a lucrative Diolcos (“a slipping through”)— a wooden
tramway along which ships were drawn on rollers over four miles of
land.f Its fortress was the impregnable Acrocorinthus, a mountain peak
two thousand feet high, watered by its own inexhaustible spring. Strabo
has described for us the stirring sight from the citadel, with the city
spread out on two bright</p>
<p>• So in 1789 Camille Desmoulins, from his cafe rostra, urged the
Gauls to overthrow their German (Frankish) aristocracy.</p>
<p>The Diolcos was a grateful alternative to merchants who distrusted
the rough waters off Cape Malea on the sea route to the western
Mediterranean. The tramway was sturdy enough to carry the usual trading
vessel of Greek times; indeed, Augustus transported his fleet over the
Diolcos in pursuit of Antony and Cleopatra after the batde of Actium,
and a Greek squadron was similarly carried over as late as aj). 883.”
Periander planned in his day to cut tile canal that now joins the two

<p>eerraces below, the open-air theater, the great public baths, the
colonnaded market place, the gleaming temples, and the protective walls
that reached to the port of Lechaeum on the northern gulf. At the very
summit of the mount, as if to symbolize a major industry of the city,
was a temple to Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>Corinth had a history stretching back to Mycenaean times; even in</p>
<p>Homer’s day it was famous for its wealth.® After the Dorian conquest
kings ruled it, then an aristocracy dominated by the family of the
Bacchia- dae. But here, too, as in Argos, Sicyon, Megara, Athens,
Lesbos, Miletus, Samos, Sicily, and wherever Greek trade flourished, the
business class, by revolution or intrigue, captured political power;
this is the real meaning of the outbreak of “tyrannies” or dictatorships
in seventh -century Greece. About 655 Cypselus seized the government.
Having promised Zeus the entire wealth of Corinth if he succeeded, he
laid a ten per cent tax on all property each year, and gave the proceeds
to the temple, until, after a decade, he has fulfilled his vow, wh ile
leaving the city as rich as before.” His popular and intelligent rule,
through thirty years, laid the basis of Corinthian prosperity.”</p>
<p>His ruthless son, Periander, in one of the longest dictatorships in
Greek history (625-585), established order and discipline, checked
exploitation, encouraged business, patronized literature and art, and
made Corinth for a time the foremost city in Greece. He stimulated trade
by establishing a state coinage,“ and promoted industry by lowering
taxes. He solved a crisis of unemployment by undertaking great public
works, and establishing colonies abroad. He protected small businessmen
from the competition of large firms by limiting the number of slaves
that might be employed by one man, and forbidding their furt her
importation.” He relieved the</p>
<p>wealthy of their surplus gold by compelling them to contribute to a
colos- sal golden statue as an ornament for the city; he invited the
rich women of Corinth to a festival, stripped them of their costly robes
and jewels, and sent them home with half their beauty nationalized. His
enemies were numerous and powerful; he dared not go out without a heavy
guard, and his fear and seclusion made him morose and cruel. To protect
himself against revolt he acted on the cryptic advice of his fellow
dictator Thrasy- bulus of Miletus, that he should periodically cut down
the tallest ears of corn in the field.*” His concubines preyed upon him
with accusations of his wife, until in a temper he threw her downstairs;
she was pregnant, and died of the shock. He burnt the concubines alive,
and banished to Corcyra</p>
<p>• Cf. the periodical “purges” in Communist Russia, 1935 -38.</p>

<p>CHAP.IV)</p>
<p>his son Lycophron, who so grieved for his mother that he would not
speak to his father. When the Corcyreans put Lycophron to death Per-
iander seized three hundred youths of their noblest families and sent
them to King Alyattes of Lydia, that they might be made eunuchs; but the
ships that bore them touched at Samos, and the Sami ans, braving
Periander’s anger, freed them. The dictator lived to a ripe old age, and
after his death was numbered by some among the Seven Wise Men of ancient
Greece.“</p>
<p>A generation after him the Spartans overthrew the dictatorship at
Cor- inth and set up an aristocracy — not because Sparta loved liberty,
but be- cause she favored landowners against the business classes.
Nevertheless it was upon trade that the wealth of Corinth was based,
helped now and then by the devotees of Aphrodite, and the Panhellenic
Isthmian games. Courtesans were so numerous in the city that the Greeks
often used cor- inthiazomca as signifying harlotry.“ It was a common
matter in Corinth to dedicate to Aphrodite’s temple women who served her
as prostitutes, and brought their fees to the priests. One Xenophon (not
the leader of the Ten Thousand) promises the goddess fifty hetairai, or
courtesans, if she will help him to victory in the Olympic games; and
the pious Pindar, celebrating this triumph, refers to the vow without
flinching.“ “The Tem - ple of Aphrodite,” says Strabo,“ “was so rich
that it owned more than a thousand temple slaves, courtesans whom both
men and women had dedicated to the goddess. And therefore it was also on
account of these women that the city was crowded with people and grew
rich; for instance, the ship captains freely squandered their money
here.” The city was grateful, and looked upon these “hospitable ladies”
as public benefactors. “It is an ancient custom at Corinth,” says an
early author quoted by Athen- aeus,“ “whenever the city addresses any
supplication to Aphrodite… to employ as many courtesans as possible to
join in the supplication.” The courtesans had a religious festival of
their own, the Aphrodisia, which they celebrated wi th piety and pomp.”
St. Paul, in his First Epistle to the</p>
<p>Corinthians,” denounced these women, who stiU in his time plied there
their ancient trade.</p>
<p>In 480 Corinth had a population of fifty thousand citizens and sixty
thou- sand slaves — an unusually h igh proportion of freemen to slaves.”
The quest for pleasure and gold absorbed all classes, and left little
energy for literature and art. We hear of a poet Eumelus in the eighth
century, but Corinthian names seldom grace Greek letters. Periander
welcomed poets at his court, and brought Arion from Lesbos to organize
music in Corinth. In the eighth century the pottery and bronzes of
Corinth were famous;</p>

<p>in the sixth her vase painters were at the top of their profession in
Greece. Pausanias tells of a great cedar chest, in which Cypselus hid
from the Bacchiadae, and upon which artists carved elegant reliefs, with
inlays of ivory and gold.“ Probably it was in the age of Periander that
Corinth raised to Apollo a Doric temple famous for its seven monolithic
columns, five of which still stand to suggest that Corinth may have
loved beauty in more forms than one. Perhaps time and chance were
ungrateful to the city, and her annals fell to be written by men of
other loyalties. The past would be startled if it could see itself in
the pages of historians.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MEGARA</li>
</ol>
<p>Megara loved gold as much as Corinth did, and like her thrived on
com- merce; it had, however, a great poet, in whose verses the ancient
city lives as if its revolutions were one with our own. Standing at the
very entrance to the Peloponnesus, with a port on either gulf, it was in
a position to bar- gain with armies and levy tolls upon trade; to which
it added a busy tex- tile industry manned with men and women who, in the
honest phraseology of the day, were called slaves. The city flourished
best in the seventh and sixth centuries, when it disputed the commerce
of the isthmus with Cor- inth; it was then that it sent out, as trading
posts, colonies as fax-flung as Byzantium on the Bosporus and Megara
Hyblaea in Sicily. Wealth</p>
<p>moimted, but the clever gathered it so narrowly into their hands that
the mass of the people, destitute serfs amid plenty,” listened readily
to men who promised them a better life. About 630 Theagenes, having
decided to become dictator, praised the poor and denounced the rich, led
a starv- ing mob into the pastures of the wealthy breeders, had himself
voted a bodyguard, increased it, and with it overthrew the government.“
For a generation Theagenes ruled Megara, freed the serfs, humbled the
mighty, and patronized the arts. Towards 600 the rich deposed him in
turn; but a third revolution restored the democracy, which confiscated
the property of leading aristocrats, commandeered rich homes, abolished
debts, and passed a decree requiring the wealthy to refund the interest
that had been paid them by their debtors.“</p>
<p>Theognis lived through these revolutions, and described them in
bitter poems that might be the voice of our class war today. He was, he,
tells us (for he is our sole authority on this subject) , a member of an
ancient and noble family. He must have grown up in comfortable
circumstances, for he was guide, philosopher, and lover to a youth named
Cyrnus, who be-</p>

<p>came one of the leaders of the aristocratic party. He gives Cymus
much advice, and asks merely love in return. Like all lovers he
complains of short measure, and his finest extant poem reminds Cyrnus
that he will achieve immortality only through Theognis’ poetry:</p>
<p>Lo, I have given thee wings wherewith to fly</p>
<p>Over the boundless ocean and the earth;</p>
<p>Yea, on the lips of many shalt thou lie,</p>
<p>The comrade of their banquet and their mirth.</p>
<p>Youths in their loveliness shall bid thee sound</p>
<p>Upon. the silver flute’s melodious breath;</p>
<p>And when thou goest darkling underground</p>
<p>Down to the lamentable house of death.</p>
<p>Oh, yet not then from honor shalt thou cease.</p>
<p>But wander, an imperishable name,</p>

<p>Crossing from isle to isle the barren main.</p>

<p>Who cherish song shall cherish thy renown.</p>
<p>Yea, I have given thee wings, and in return</p>
<p>Thou givest me the scorn with which I bum.*</p>
<p>He warns Cymus that the injustices of the aristocracy may provoke a
revolution:</p>
<p>Our state is pregnant, shortly to produce</p>
<p>A mde avenger of prolonged abuse.</p>
<p>The commons hitherto seem sober-minded.</p>

<p>The revolution came; Theognis was among the men exiled by the tri-
umphant democracy, and his property was confiscated. He left his wife
and children with friends, and wandered from state to state — Euboea,
Thebes, Sparta, Sicily; at first welcomed and fed for his poetry, then
lapsing into a bitter and unaccustomed poverty. Out of his resentment he
addresses to Zeus the questions which Job would ask of Yahweh;</p>
<p>Blessed, almighty Jove! with deep amaze</p>
<p>I view the world, and marvel at thy ways</p>
<p>How can you reconcile it to your sense</p>
<p>Of right and wrong, thus loosely to dispense</p>
<p>Your bounties on the wicked and the good.?</p>
<p>How can your laws be known or understood?*“</p>
<p>He becomes bitter against the leaders of the democracy, and prays to
this inscrutable Zeus for the boon of drinking their blood.<em>“ In the
first known use of this metaphor he likens the state of Megara to a ship
whose pilot has been replaced by disorderly and unskilled
mariners.</em>“ He argues that some men are by nature abler than others,
and that therefore aristoc- racy in some form is inevitable; already men
had discovered that majorities never rule. He uses hoi agathoi, the
good, as synonymous with the aristo- crats, and hoi kakoi, the bad,
base, worthless, as signifying the common people.“* These native
differences, he thinks, are ineradicable; “no amount of teaching will
make a bad man good,” **® — though he may merely mean here that no
training can turn a commoner into an aristocrat. Like all good
conservatives he is strong for eugenics: the evils of the world are due
not to tne greed of the “good” but to their misalliances and their
infertility.”*</p>
<p>He plots with Cymus another counterrevolution; he argues that even if
one has taken a vow of loyalty to the new government it is permissible
to assassinate a tyrant; and he pledges himself to work with his friends
until they have taken full vengeance upon their foes.. Nevertheless,
after many years of exile and loneliness, he bribes an official to let
him return to Megara.**“ He is revolted at his own duplicity, and writes
lines of despair that hundreds of Greeks would quote:</p>
<p>Not to be bom, never to see the sun —</p>
<p>No worldly blessing is a greater one!</p>
<p>And the next best is speedily to die.</p>
<p>And lapt beneath a load of earth to lie.*“</p>
<p>In the end we find him back in Megara, old and broken, and promising,
for safety’s sake, never again to write of politics. He consoles himself
with</p>

<li>AEGINA AND EPIDAURUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Across the bay from Megara and Corinth earthquake had raised, or
left, one of their earliest rivals in industry and trade — the island of
Aegina. There, in Mycenaean times, a prosperous city developed, whose
graves gave up much gold.“^ The conquering Dorians found the land too
barren for tillage, but admirably placed for commerce. When the Persians
came the island knew only an aristocracy of tradesmen, eager to sell the
excellent vases and bronzes produced in their shops for the slaves whom
they imported in great number to work in their factories, or for sale to
the cities of Greece. Aristotle, about 350, calculated that Aegina had a
population of half a million, of whom 470,000 were slaves.^® Here the
first Greek coins were made, and the Aeginetan weights and measures
remained standard in Greece till its conquest by Rome.</p>
<p>That such a commercial community could graduate from wealth to art
was revealed when, in 181 1, a traveler discovered in a heap of rubbish
the vigorous and finely carved figures that once adorned the pediment of
the temple of Aphaea. Of the temple itself twenty-two Doric columns
stand, still bearing their architrave. Probably the Aeginetans built it
shortly before the Persian War; for though its architecture is classic,
its statuary shows many traces of the archaic, semi-Oriental style.
Possibly, however, it wgs raised after Salamis; for the statuary, which
represents Aeginetans overcoming Trojans, may sym- bolize the perennial
conflict between Greece and the Orient, and the recent victory won by
the Greek fleet under the very brows of Aegina at Salamis. To that fleet
the little island contributed thirty ships; and one of these, after the
victory, was awarded by the Greeks the first prize for bravery.</p>
<p>A pleasant boat ride takes the traveler from Aegina to Epidaurus, now
a village of five hundred souls, but once among the most famous cities
of</p>

<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>Greece. For here — or rather ten miles out in a narrow gorge among
the loftiest mountains of the Argolic peninsula — was the chief home of
Ascle- pius, the hero- god of healing. “O Asclepius!” Apollo himself had
said through his oracle at Delphi, “thou who art bom a great joy to all
mortals, whom lovely Coronis bare to me, the child of love, at rochy
Epidaurus.”<em>“ Asclepius cured so many people — even raising a man
from the dead — that Pluto, god of Hades, complained to Zeus that hardly
anyone was dying any more; and Zeus, who would hardly know what to do
with the human race if it were not for death, destroyed Asclepius with a
thunderbolt.”</em> But the people, first in Thessaly, then in Greece,
worshiped him as a savior god. At Epidaurus they raised to him the
greatest of his temples, and them dbe physician-priests who from him
were called Asclepiads established a sanitarium known throughout Hellas
for its success in treating disease. Epi- daurus became a Greek Lourdes;
pilgrims flocked to it from every part of the Mediterranean world,
seeking what to the Greeks seemed the great- est boon of all — health.
They slept in the temple, submitted hopefully to the regimen prescribed,
and recorded their cures, which they believed to be miraculous, on stone
tablets that still lie here and there among the ruins of the sacred
grove. It was out of the fees and gifts of these patients that Epi-
daums built its theater, and the stadium whose seats and goals still lie
in the lap of the neighboring hills, and the lovely tholos — a circular,
colon- naded building whose surviving fragments, preserved in the little
museum, are among the most exquisitely carved marbles in Greece. Today
such patients go to Tenos in the Cyclades, where the priests of the
Greek Church heal them”* as those of Asclepius healed their forerunners
two thousand five hundred years ago. And the gloomy peak where once the
people of Epidaurus sacrificed to Zeus and Hera is now the sacred mount
of St. Elias. TTie gods are mortal, but piety is everlasting.</p>
<p>What the student looks for most eagerly at Epidaurus is not the
leveled ruins of the Asclepium. The land is well wooded here, and he
does not see the perfect theater that he is seeking until a turn in the
road spreads it out against the mountainside in a gigantic fan of stone.
Polycleitus the Younger built it in the fourth century before our era,
but even to this day it is almost completely preserved. As the traveler
stands in the center of the orchestra, or dancing place — a spacious
circle paved with stone — and sees before him fourteen thousand seats in
rising tiers, so admirably designed that every seat directly faces him;
as his glance follows the radiating aisles that rise in swift straight
lines from the stage to the trees of the mountain slope above; as he
