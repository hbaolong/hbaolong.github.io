<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XGrandeur and Decadence of Spain</p>
<p>1556-1665</p>
<p>I. SPANISH LIFE</p>
<p>T hose of us who have been brought up on the English historians</p>
<p>easily forget that after as well as b^efore the defeat of the
Armada</p>
<p>Spain was the greatest, richest, farthest-flung empire on earth,
and</p>
<p>that she considered herself, not without reason, superior to
Elizabethan England in literature and to contemporary Italy in art. When
Philip II came to the throne (1556), the Spanish monarchy ruled Spain,
Roussillon, Franche-Comte, Ceuta, Oran, the Netherlands, the duchy of
Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, the Philippines, the
West Indies, most of South America, part of North America, all of
Central America; add (1580-1640) Portugal and the Portuguese possessions
in Asia, Africa, and Brazil; add also a protectorate over Savoy, Parma,
and Tuscany, and an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire ruled by
Philip’s uncle, Ferdinand I. Spain had an army of fifty thousand men
noted for their bravery and discipline, and led by the best generals of
the age; a navy of 140 vessels; an annual revenue ten times that of
England. The gold and silver of America flowed into Spanish ports. The
Spanish court in this age was the most splendid, and the Spanish
aristocracy the proudest, in the world. The Spanish language was spoken
by millions of people outside Spain, and in many countries the educated
classes learned Spanish as in the eighteenth century they would learn
French. Spanish architecture adorned cities in five continents.</p>
<p>Spain had now some eight million population. Agriculture languished
as more and more land was turned to pasture sheep for the production of
wool. About 1560 there were fifty thousand textile workers in Toledo
alone. The demands of her colonies stimulated Spain’s industries;
Seville became one of the busiest ports in Europe; and the colonies in
return sent cargoes of silver and gold. The influx of precious metals
raised prices hectically — in Andalusia 500 per cent in the sixteenth
century; wages clambered in feverish, and finally futile, pursuit of
living costs. Much of the industry was manned by Moriscos — Moors
superficially converted to Christianity. Domestic service was largely
left to slaves captured in African raids or in wars against “infidels.”
The Spanish commoners scorned labor, and were philosophically content
with little; to sleep in a hut, bask in the</p>

<p>CHAP. X) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 275</p>
<p>sun, Strum a guitar, and mourn the stinginess of beauty seemed better
than to sweat like a slave or a A 4 oor. The expulsion of the Moriscos
in 1609 shared with the high prices of Spanish products in the decline
of Spanish industry.</p>
<p>The expulsion of the Jews in 1492 had left a vacuum in the commercial
and financial structure of Spain. The Genoese and the Dutch became the
chief carriers of Spain’s foreign trade. Spain, governed by gr andees
more adept in diplomacy and war than in economic affairs, allowed her
wealth to depend upon the import of gold; for a time the government grew
richer while the people remained poor; but much of the gold was poured
out for war, much of it was tak en by foreign merchants carrying Spain’s
trade, until the government was almost as poor as the people. Spain re-
peatedly repudiated its debts (1557, 15751 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647) or
compelled their conversion into new loans; it was these financial crises
that forced her to end her war with Henry II in 1559, with Henry IV in
1598, and with the United Provinces in 1609. In history we must chercher
not la femme but le banquier.</p>
<p>In Spain we must also look for the priest. Nowhere else on the globe
had religion such power over the people, and therefore over the govern-
ment. Spain rejected not only the Reformation, but — except for an
Erasmian moment — the Renaissance as well. It remained medieval amid
modernity, and contentedly so. The poverty of the people gloried in the
wealth of the Church. Everybody was pious, from the kings who were “more
Catholic than the pope,”^ to the bandits who were never found without
religious medallions or scapulars. In 1615 some forty thousand Spaniards
marched in a demonstration demanding that the Pope make the Immaculate
Conception of the Virgin (i.e., her freedom from the stain of original
sin) a de fide dogma — a belief obligatory on all Catholics.^ Priests,
monks, and friars were everywhere, not smiling on the joys of life and
love as in Italy or France, but casting an aura of El Greco somber- ness
over all affairs except bullfights. Spain had now 9,088 monasteries,
32,000 Dominican and Franciscan friars,® and a rising number of Jesuits.
Churches were dark, rich in awesome relics, and adorned with realistic
terrors in their art. Stories of the saints and their miracles were the
cher- ished poetry of the people. The lyrics of St. John of the Cross
and the writings of St. Teresa made mysticism popular. The Church
herself had to protest against the claims of “Quietists” to divine
communion and beatific visions; in 1640 the Inquisition laid its claws
upon a sect of Alum- brados — “Enlightened Ones” — who claimed that
their mystical union with God cleansed them of sin even in their erotic
ecstasies. We must bear in mind this pervasive and perfervid piety if we
are to understand why the Spanish people could look with passionate
approval upon the burning of heretics, and bleed itself to bankruptcy
and exhaustion in fighting for the</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xfaith in Germany and the Netherlands. There was something noble in
this insanity. It was as if the nation felt that unless its faith were
true, life would be a meaningless absurdity.</p>
<p>So the Inquisition continued its conscientious ferocity. It checked
with “moderate” punishments — such as a hundred lashes — such heresies
as that fornication is no sin, or that marriage is as holy as monastic
celibacy. But for “relapsed” Marranos — converted Jews who secretly
returned to Judaism — death or life imprisonment was the standard
expiation. When Philip II arrived in Spain (1559) he was welcomed at
Valladolid with an auto-da-fe in which 200,000 persons, presided over by
the King, saw ten heretics strangled and two burned alive.“* One of the
condemned appealed to Philip for mercy; he refused it, and won the
admiration of the people by saying, “If my own son were sucli a wretch
as you are, I myself would carry the faggots to burn him.”® Philip
occasionally checked the tendency</p>
<p>The Inquisition prided itself on preserving the medieval faith
undiluted, and on saving Spain from the religious disunity that was
convulsing France. Its emphasis on belief rather than conduct left the
protection of morals to the clergy — who were themselves notoriously lax
in their behavior — and to civil officials whose authority with the
public was impaired by their subjection to Inquisition imprisonment and
fines. Female purity was guarded not only by religion and law, but by
the punto, or point of honor, which required every male to defend or
avenge by the sword the threatened or violated chastity of any woman in
his family. Dueling was illegal but popular. Decent women were usually
kept at home in a semi-Arabic seclusion; they dined apart from the men,
seldom accompanied them in public, and used closed coaches when they
stirred outside their homes. Suitors made their plea with music from the
streets to maidens behind grated windows; they were rarely admitted into
the house until the parents on both sides had come to an agreement;
nevertheless there were many love marriages.^ Under Philip II the level
of morality was kept as high as the beauty of the women or the
imagination of the men allowed; the natural venality of officials was
moderated by the watchfulness of the King; and until the defeat of the
Armada the morale of the nation was sustained by the belief that Spain
was leading a holy war against Islam, the Netherlands, and England. When
that dream broke, Spain collapsed in body and soul.</p>
<p>CHAP. X) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 277</p>
<p>Meanwhile Spanish life had its characteristic splendor and charm.</p>
<p>Charity was widely spread, and good manners ran through every class.
Half the nation claimed noble blood, tried to live up to the pretense of
chivalric courtesy, and insisted on dressing like the uppermost tenth.
Under Philip II dress was fairly simple: the men wore ruffs, doublets,
tight dark hose, and buckled boots; the ladies (all were ladies) covered
their curves with stiff, flat corsages, veiled from the other sex all of
their faces except their eyes (which are especially inflammatory in
Spanish women), and so coyly hid their feet that a glimpse of these was
among the most exciting rewards of a lover’s prayers.® In the relaxing
of morals that followed Philip’s death, female dress became fancier,
fans were flaunted in wordless badinage, rouge glowed on faces,
shoulders, bosoms, and hands, and mysterious legs were concealed in
hoopskirts so ample that theater owners charged each such inflated woman
for two seats.</p>
<p>The bullfight continued to be the favorite spectacle. Pope Pius V
issued a bull against it in 1567, but Philip II protested that such a
prohibition would loose a revolution in Spain, and the edict was
ignored. Religious pro- cessions added a solemn poetry to prosaic days,
and carnival masks covered a multitude of sins. Music was a passion only
secondary — and closely allied — to religion and love. The guitar-shaped
vihuela strummed hypnotic obbligatos to amours, and madrigals enjoyed a
passing popularity. In church music Spain rivaled Italy. Tomas Luis de
Victoria, the Velazquez of</p>
<p>Spanish music, grew up in St. Teresa’s Avila and may have felt her in
- fluence. He had a voice and a vocation; probably he was ordained to
the priesthood in 1564; certainly, a year later, Philip gave him an
allowance to study music in Italy. By 1571 he was choirmaster in the
Collegium Germanicum in Rome. In 1572, aged thirty-two, he issued a book
of motets containing the inspired O vos omnes setting to Jeremiah’s
lamenta - tion over Jerusalem. Returning to Spain (1583), he presented
to Philip II a book of Masses including one of his noblest compositions,
the Mass O quam gloriosum. For the obsequies of Philip’s sister Maria,
widow of Em - peror Maximilian II, he wrote a deeply moving Requiem Mass
which a dis- tinguished historian of music has ranked as “one of the
most magnificent compositions of the entire literature.”® He called it
his swan song; after its publication ( 1 603 ) he gave himself wholly to
his duties as a priest. He was among the outstanding ornaments of
Spain’s most famous reign.</p>

<p>Here is one of the strangest, strongest figures in history, fanatical
and conscientious, hotly hated outside Spain, passionately loved within
it, a</p>

<p>Xchallenge to any student struggling for objectivity. His ancestry
was his fate: his father was Charles V, who left him a kingdom and an
obligation to bigotry; his paternal grandmother was Juana la Loca, the
insane daughter of Ferdinand the Catholic; mysticism and madness were in
his blood, dogma and absolutism were in his heritage. His mother,
Isabella of Portugal, had two other sons, both of whom died of apoplexy
in their childhood; she her- self died at thirty-six, when Philip was
twelve. He was born at Valladolid in 1527, at the very time when his
father’s troops were sacking Rome and im - prisoning the Pope. He was
brought up by priests and women who</p>
<p>immersed him in piety and convinced him that the Catholic Church was
the indispensable support of morality and monarchy. Whereas his father,
reared in Flanders, had become a man of the world, Philip, living mostly
in Spain, became, despite his fair skin and silken yellow hair, a
Spaniard in face and creed, body and mind.</p>
<p>He had almost no youth, for at thirteen he was made governor of</p>
<p>Milan and at sixteen regent of Spain — and this last in no merely
nominal sense. Charles appointed advisers for him, explained their
characters pene- tratingly, bade him play one councilor against another,
and urged him to keep all real power and all final decisions for himself
— which Philip did to the end of his days. In that year 1543 Philip
married his cousin Princess Maria of Portugal; she died in 1 545,
shortly after presenting him with a “star - crossed” son, Don Carlos.
Philip now contracted a morganatic</p>
<p>sons who would keep England Catholic. So in 1554 he crossed the
Channel, married plain, ailing, hopeful Mary (eleven years older than
himself), did his best to make her pregnant, failed, and departed (1555)
to become governor of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Year by year his responsibilities grew. In 1554 he had been made gov-
ernor of the double kingdom of Naples and Sicily. In 1 556 Charles
resigned to him the crown of Spain. For four years Philip ruled his
scattered realms from Brussels. He struggled to adjust his Spanish
solemnity to Flemish jol- lity and Dutch finance. He had no taste for
war, but his generals won for him, at St.-Quentin (1557), a battle that
induced the French to sign the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis. To establish
some friendship with France Philip married Elizabeth of Valois, daughter
of Henry II and Catherine de Medicis. Then, thinking matters stabilized,
he bade farewell to the Nether- lands, and sailed from Ghent (August
1559) to immure himself for the rest of his life in Spain.</p>
<p>CHAP. X) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 279</p>
<p>He transferred the capital from Toledo to Madrid (1560), and soon</p>
<p>afterward, loving solitude, and ill at ease in crowds, he
commissioned Juan Bautista and Juan de Herrera to build for him,
twenty-seven miles northwest of Madrid, an architectural ensemble
including a royal palace, an administrative center, a college, a
seminary, a monastery, a church, and a mausoleum — for Philip was now as
religious as politics would permit. In the battle of St.-Quentin his
cannon had demolished a church dedicated to St. Lawrence; in repentance
of this sacrilege, and in gratitude for his victory, he had vowed to
raise a shrine to the saint in Spain. So he named the vast assemblage of
structures El Sitio Real de San Lorenzo — the royal seat of
St. Lawrence; time, however, has christened it Escorial, from a town
nearby, which itself took its name from the scoriae, or slag, of the
local iron mines.^° As St. Lawrence was believed to have been burned to
death on an iron grill, Juan Bautista designed the ground plan as a
gridiron crisscrossed by halls from side to side, dividing the inner
space into sixteen courts.</p>
<p>Driving out to it from Madrid, one wonders how, in an age with no</p>
<p>faster communication than horses’ feet, Philip could have governed
his global realm from such a sanctuary, lost in gloomy hills; but Madrid
was still farther remote from the world. The great pile is left desolate
today except for the monks and their services; but in its prime, with
its Renais- sance fa§ade 744 feet long, its towers and spires, and the
massive dome of the church, it served as an awesome symbol of Spanish
power, garnished with piety and art. Here half of Christendom was ruled;
religion and gov- ernment were united in one labyrinth of policy and
stone; here the King could live, as he longed to do, not among courtiers
but among priests and monks and saintly relics, and hearing many times a
day the bells of the Mass. Here the Panteon was to receive the remains
of Spain’s kings and queens; the library was to become one of the
richest in Europe; the picture gallery would soon harbor masterpieces by
Raphael, Titian, Tin- toretto, Veronese, El Greco, and Velazquez; here
Pellegrino Tibaldi,</p>
<p>Bartolommeo Carducci, and Federigo Zuccaro came from Italy to join
Juan Fernandez Navarrete, Luis de Morales, Luis de Carbajal, and other
Spanish artists in frescoing the endless walls and vaults. The royal
palace was left entirely simple, but the church, though of sternly Doric
order, had an altar gleaming with porphyry, agate, and gold, and backed
with a retablo elaborate in its ornament. The hall for the reception of
dignitaries was vast and ornate, but Philip’s own room was the poorest
chamber in the building, as modest as a hermit’s cell.^^ The building
symbolized Philip’s power, the room expressed his character.</p>
<p>He tried hard to be a saint, but could not forget that he was a
king.</p>
<p>He knew that he was the mightiest ruler on earth and felt a politic
obli- gation to hauteur; but he dressed so simply that some strangers,
coming</p>
<p>28o the age of reason begins (chap. </p>
<p>Xupon him in the Escorial, mistook him for an attendant and allowed
him to be their cicerone.^^ His protrusive Hapsburg chin should have
betrayed him, for it was an outstanding challenge to the world. In 1559,
before time and trials had hardened him, he was described by a Venetian
ambassador as “always showi ng such gentleness and humanity as no prince
could sur- pass,”^® and an English ambassador reported him (1563) as “of
good dis - position, soft nature, and given to tranquillity.”^^ No one
found any</p>
<p>public humor in him; heartless enemies said that in all his life he
had smiled only once — on hearing of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew;
privately, however, he relished pranks and jests and laughed heartily
enough.^® He collected books with taste and zeal, but preferred art to
literature; he was a discriminating patron of Titian and critic of El
Greco; he loved music and played the guitar when the world was not
looking. He had all the Spanish courtesy of manners, but was awkward
with shyness and stiffened with ceremony. He made a handsome figure till
his penchant for pastry and sweets crippled him with gout. From his
youth he was subject to ill health, and if he rounded out his threescore
years and ten it was only by an obstinate resolve to complete his tasks.
He took government as a sacred duty, and labored at it day after day for
fifty years. He seems really to have believed that God had chosen him to
stem the Protestant tide; hence his grim tenacity and his reluctant
cruelty; “he had no natur al preference for violent courses.”^® He never
forgot a favor (Egmont’s case excepted)</p>
<p>In political morality he compared well enough with his
contemporaries. He hated war, never began one, and bore almost a full
generation of in- juries from England before commissioning the Armada.
He was capable, even beyond most rulers, of sanctimonious dissimulation.
Apparently he joined in a conspiracy to kill Elizabeth, as a last resort
to save Mary Stuart.<em>® His government of Spain was autocratic but
just. He “had an immense solicitude for his subjects, and remedied
whatever social injustices he could find time to discover.”</em>®</p>
<p>His private morals were above those of most sixteenth-century kings.
In his youth at Brussels, if we may believe his enemies, “he was grossly
licentious,” and “it was his chief amusement to issue forth at night dis
- guised, that he might indulge in vulgar and miscellaneous incontinence
in the common haunts of vice.”®“ Years later William of Orange, leading
the Netherlands revolt, accused the hermit of the Escorial of having
murdered his own son and poisoned his third wife;®* but an indignant man
makes a poor historian. However, an unquestionably great and brave his-
torian, the Spanish Jesuit Mariana, renders a like hostile verdict;
while CHAP. X) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 281</p>
<p>crediting Philip with “liberality, resolution, vigilancy, and
abstemiousness in eating and drinking,” he charged him with “lust,
cruelty, pride, perfidy, and several other vices.”^^ A recent Dutch
historian concludes, “Philip II could not be reproached with wantonness
. . . dissipation and immorality . . . After his return to Spain he led,
so far as we know, an austerely moral life”^® as a faithful husband and
a solicitous father. When his third wife, Elizabeth of Valois, fell ill
of smallpox (then often fatal), Philip seldom left her side, though his
ministers pleaded with him not to run such</p>
<p>risk of infection. After Elizabeth’s death Philip undertook another
diplo - matic marriage (1570), with one of many Annes of Austria; Anne
died in 1580, and thereafter Philip spent his warm domestic affections
upon his daughters. His letters to them are human with humor and love.^^
Isabel Clara became his closest companion and his chief solace amid the
cares and defeats of old age. In his will he called her the light of his
eyes. He had no comfort in his sons.</p>
<p>Legend and literature* and human pity have made Philip’s first
son</p>
<p>better known than his father. Carlos was constitutionally weak,
subject to intermittent fever, melancholy, and outbursts of temper and
pride. He was prodigally generous and fiercely brave; he amused his
grandfather, the once great Charles V, by reproaching him for having
fled from Maurice of Saxony at Innsbruck (1552) — “/ never would have
fled!”^® In the preliminaries to the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis Carlos,
then fourteen, had been promised in marriage to Elizabeth of Valois; but
in the treaty itself Phihp, widowed by the death of Mary Tudor, took the
Princess as his own wife, to divert French friendship from England to
Spain. A year later (1560) the bride came to Madrid; Carlos, seeing her
demure beauty, may have resented his father’s variation of the droit du
seigneur, but there is no evidence of any romance between him and the
fourteen-year-old Queen.^®</p>
<p>Despite Carlos’ illness, he was formally recognized as heir to the
crown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don Carlos was made the subject of plays by Schiller, Alfieri,
Otway, Marie Joseph de Chenier, Juan Perez de Montalvan, etc.</li>

<p>Xsympathy with the Netherland rebels. When Alva was appointed to</p>
<p>command in the Low Countries, Carlos protested that the mission
should have been assigned to him; he forbade Alva to go, and attacked
him with drawn dagger when the Duke insisted.^’’ Apparently the Prince
thought for a time of fleeing to the Netherlands and putting himself at
the head of the revolt.^* Philip commissioned unwilling ministers to
watch him. Carlos made plans to escape, sent out agents to collect
funds, amassed 150,000 ducats, and ordered eight horses for his flight
(January 1568). He confided his plan to Don Juan of Austria, who
revealed it to the King. Fearing that his son, if allowed to leave
Spain, would be used by Elizabeth of England or William of Orange as a
contender to depose him, Philip ordered a stricter watch over the
Prince. Carlos threatened suicide; Philip deprived him of all weapons
and confined him in the royal palace at Madrid.</p>
<p>Thus far Philip’s conduct admitted of defense; but now bigotry
intensi - fied the tragedy. Suspecting his son of heresy, the King
ordered that no books should be allowed him but a breviary and some
manuals of devotion. Carlos spurned the books and neglected all
religious observances. A priest warned him that the Inquisition might be
led to inquire whether he was a Christian. Carlos tried to kill himself,
but was prevented; however, he accomplished his purpose by rejecting all
food for three days, then</p>
<p>gorging himself with meat and ice water. A severe dysentery set in;
the Prince welcomed death, accepted the last sacrament, forgave his
father, and died, aged twenty- three (July 24, 1568). Antonio Perez,
Philip’s exile d enemy, accused him of having poisoned Carlos; most of
Europe believed it, research has disproved it.* But the severity of the
youth’s imprisonment stands as one of many dark spots on the record of
the King.</p>
<p>His conduct toward his half-brother, Don Juan of Austria, casts
another shadow over the picture. The natural son of Charles V and
Barbara</p>
<p>Blomberg seems to have excited in Philip an admiration troubled with
jealousy. Nevertheless he raised Juan to the rank of prince, and commis-
sioned him to organize an expedition against the pirates of Algeria.
Juan acquitted himself brilliantly. Philip gave him command of the
land</p>
<p>forces against the rebel Moriscos of Granada; Juan accomplished his
mission witli no time or mercy wasted. Philip appointed him — ^aged
twenty-four — admiral in chief of the combined navies in the “last</p>
<p>crusade”; Juan defeated the Turks at Lepanto and became the hero of
Christendom. He felt that he deserved a kingdom, and he fretted when
Philip made him merely governor general of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>CHAP. X) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 283</p>
<p>The silent King, always too proud to explain or defend himself in the
forum of public opinion, received the full blame for another tragedy. He
had raised to his Council a clever and elegant commoner, Antonio Perez,
who was believed to be the natural son of Philip’s most trusted friend,
Ruy Gomez, Prince of Eboli. When Gomez died (1573), Perez became the
confidant — probably the lover^® — of the doubly intriguing widow. Ana
de Mendoza, Princess of Eboli. Philip himself was said to have had a
liaison with this one-eyed beauty eleven years before, but here
“history” is probably romancing.*® Perez conspired with her to profit
from their knowledge of state secrets. When Juan de Escobedo threatened
to reveal their dubious trafficking, Perez persuaded Philip that
Escobedo had plotted treason, and the King gave Perez an order for
Juan’s assassina - tion. Perez kept the order to himsel f for six
months; then, to Philip’s surprise and embarrassment, he had it carried
out (1578). A year later the secret papers of Don Juan of Austria
convinced Philip of Escobedo’s</p>
<p>innocence. He arrested Perez and confined the Princess to her palace.
Perez confessed under torture and agreed to restore 12,000,000 maravedis
to the treasury. With the help of his wife he escaped to Aragon, where
the Inquisition, at Philip’s urging, pursued him as a heretic. He fled
to France, ascribed his persecution to the King’s lingering passion for
La Eboli, betrayed Spain’s military and financial weaknesses to the
French and English governments, and spurred Essex to raid Spanish ships
and coasts. He died in Paris in 16 ii, after vain attempts to win pardon
and asylum from Philip I 1 I.*‘</p>
<p>Philip found good reason for following the advice that his father had
given him not to trust his aides. The grandees, like the French nobles,
were jealous of the royal power, and were not above conspiring against
the King. He kept them at odds among themselves, played them against one
another, received summaries of their rival views, and made his own
decisions. Losing faith in his subordinates, he labored personally on
details of ad- ministration in every field — papal policy, public works,
local abuses, roads and bridges, dredging rivers for navigation,
establishing libraries, reforming and codifying Spanish law, and
directing an extensive geo- graphical, historical, and statistical
survey of Spain, whose fifteen folio volumes are still unpublished.’**
Undertaking more than even his industry could manage, he fell into a
philosophy of procrastination; many problems, he noted, lost urgency or
meaning if resolutely deferred; in several cases, however, as in the
Netherlands, the course of events decided against him while he weighed
or pigeonholed pros and cons. In his royal cubicle he dictated or wrote
with his own hand instructions for his appointees in five continents. He
assumed that kingly power should be absolute; he ignored or overrode the
cartes, or provincial assemblies, except in Aragon; he</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xissued decrees, even of death, without public trial; and he
comforted his autocracy with the conviction that only so could he
protect the poor against the rich.<em>® Within his despotism he built
up, in a Europe almost universally corrupt, a bureaucracy and a
judiciary comparatively com- petent and just.</em>^</p>
<p>He respected the Church as the traditional molder of morals and</p>
<p>guardian of kings, but he kept religion as subject to the state in
Spain as Henry VIII or Elizabeth I in England. He placed so high a value
on</p>
<p>religious unity as an organ of government that he counted it “bett er
not to reign at all than to reign over heretics.”<em>® Convinced that
the Moriscos, while pretending Catholicism, were still practicing the
Islamic ritual, he issued (1567) a pragmatica forbidding all Moorish
customs, the use of the Arabic language, and the possession of Arabic
books. The Moriscos rose in revolt (1568), captured a large region south
of Granada, massacred Christians, tortured priests, and sold women and
children into Berber slavery in exchange for powder and guns. The
rebellion was suppressed after two years of competitive atrocities. AU
Moriscos were expelled from the province of Granada and were scattered
among Christian communities in Castile; their children were placed in
Christian homes, and school attendance was made compulsory for all
children — the first such require- ment in Europe.</em>® Philip, at war
with the Turks, suspected the Moriscos remaining in Valencia and
Catalonia of plotting with the enemy, but his hands were so full that he
left the final stage of the problem to his</p>
<p>successor.</p>
<p>His father had bequeathed to him the defense of Christendom against
Islam as a major part of Hapsburg policy. In 1570 he joined with Venice
and the papacy in a crusade to end the Turkish mastery of the Mediter-
ranean. Cyprus fell to the Turks while Philip formulated plans and the
three allies assembled a fleet. By the summer of 1571 they had collected
at Messina 208 galleys, 50,000 seamen, and 29,000 soldiers; a crucifix
was at every prow, banners were blessed, prayers rose en masse to the
sky, and the inspiring young Admiral issued the crusading call; “Christ
is your</p>
<p>general, you fight the battle of the Cross.” On September 16, 1571,
the fleet sailed off to a victory that ended Turkish predominance in
the</p>
<p>Mediterranean. As Spain had furnished more than her share of ships
and men, the glamour of Lepanto fell upon Don Juan and the King, and</p>
<p>Philip neared the crest of his curve. The zenith came when he fell
heir to the throne of Portugal (1580) and added that strategic land to
his swelling realm.</p>
<p>His abiding grief was the revolt in the Netherlands. He learned
with</p>
<p>wrath that Coligny, the Protestant leader, had almost convinced
Charles IX that France should ally itself with the rebels. When news
came that</p>
<p>CHAP. X) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 285</p>
<p>Charles had let loose the Massacre of St. Bartholomew upon the Hugue-
nots, Philip rejoiced, and he hardened his heart against the
Netherlands. He urged and paid for the assassination of William of
Orange. He tried to buy the friendship of Henry of Navarre, but Henry
proved unpur- chasable. So Philip bought the Guises and the Catholic
League, and</p>
<p>dreamed of making his daughter the queen of France; then Spain and
France, joining forces, would subdue the Netherlands, make Mary Stuart
queen of England, and end Protestantism everywhere. When Elizabeth sent
aid to Holland (1585) and Mary to her death (1587), Philip, after years
of bearing with politic patience the harrying of Spanish vessels,
coasts, and treasure by Elizabeth’s privateers, turned to war and
bankrupted his government to finance the Armada. All Spain supported the
effort and prayed for victory, feeling that the fate of that fleet would
determine the history of Europe.</p>
<p>Philip took the ignominious catastrophe with outward stoicism, saying
that he had sent the ships to fight men, not winds. But it broke his
spirit and almost broke Spain, though he survived and fought through ten
years more and Spain took a century to admit her ruin. He could hardly
believe that God had abandoned him after thirty years of fighting for
the faith; yet the dark truth must have come to him at last that after
taxing his people into poverty he had failed in everything except the
accidental acquisition of Portugal and the temporary repulse of the
Turks — who had recaptured</p>
<p>Bereavements, isolation, and disease joined to humble the once proud
and confident King. His fourth wife had died in 1580; of the three
children that she had borne him only one survived, a mediocre lad to
whom must be transmitted the first empire upon which the sun never set.
The people still reverenced Philip, despite his errors and defeats; they
were con- vinced that he had labored in a sacred cause and had played
the game of power no more unscrupulously than his enemies, and they bore
with- out reproach the misery into which his economic policies, his
taxation, and his failures had depressed them. In his old age his
father’s last bequest, gout, racked his limbs with pain and crippled him
with paralysis; one eye had gone bad with a cataract; repulsive sores
mangled his skin. In June 1598 he was borne in a litter to the Escorial,
into that favorite room through whose window he could see the high altar
of the church. For fifty-three days he lay rotting, bearing all in the
trust that these were God’s tests cf</p>

<p>Xhis faith, keeping tliat faith to the awful end, clutching and
kissing a</p>
<p>crucifix, and repeating, repeating prayers. He ordered the release of
some prisoners as a final act of mercy. He sent for his son, counseled
him always to be merciful and just, and bade him see the humbling finale
of earthly power. His sufferings ended on September 13, 1598.</p>
<p>He had done the best he could with an intelligence too cramped by</p>
<p>education, too narrow for his empire, too inflexible for his diverse
responsi- bilities. We cannot know that his faith was false; we only
feel that it was bigoted and cruel, like almost all the faiths of the
age, and that it darkened his mind and his people while it consoled
their poverty and supported his pride. But he was not the ogre that the
fervent pens of his foes have pictured. He was as just and generous,
within his lights, as any ruler of his century except Henry IV. He was
decent in his married life, loving and loved in his family, patient
under provocation, brave in adversity, conscientious in toil. He paid to
the full for his rich and damning heritage.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>PHILIP III: 1598-1621</li>
</ol>
<p>His heir was quite another Philip. The father, seeing the youth’s im
-</p>
<p>provident lassitude, had mourned, “God, who has given me so many king
- doms, has not granted me a son fit to govern them.”®^ Philip III, now
twenty, was even more pious than his sire, so that gossip doubted that
he had ever committed even a venial sin. Timid and meek, and quite
unable to command, he handed over all the powers and perquisites of
government to Francisco Gomez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma.</p>
<p>The Duke was a man of some benevolence, for he promoted nearly all
his relatives to lucrative offices. He did not neglect himself; in his
twenty years as chief minister he grossed so fat a fortune that popular
resentment estimated it at the impossible sum of 44,000,000 ducats.*® He
spared to the treasury enough to equip two armadas against England
(1599, 1601); both were shattered by unsympathetic winds. Lerma had the
good sense to welcome the pacific overtures of James I, and after
nineteen years of war Spain and England signed the Peace of London
(1604). The war in the Netherlands continued, draining gold from Spain
faster than it could come from America; Lerma found it beyond his
ingenuity to satisfy, out of the revenues of an exhausted country, the
needs of his hampered generals and his private purse. Realizing the
futility of further efforts to deny independence to the United
Provinces, he signed with them a</p>
<p>twelve-year truce (1609).</p>
<p>But his next enterprise was as costly as war. He was a native of
Valencia,</p>
<p>CHAP, x) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 287</p>
<p>where there were thirty thousand Adorisco families; he had enough
piety to hate these farmers and craftsmen, whose industry and thrift
kept them prosperous amid the proud and shiftless penury of the
Christians. He knew that these Christianized Moors, resenting their
persecution by Philip II, maintained treasonous contacts with the
Moslems of Africa and Turkey, and with Henry IV of France, who hoped to
raise timely revolts in</p>
<p>Spain.®* It was unpatriotic of the Moriscos to avoid wine and eat so
little meat; in this way the burden of the taxes on these commodities
fell almost wholly upon the Spanish Christians. Cervantes expressed the
fear that the Moriscos, who, rarely celibate, had a higher birth rate
than the “Old</p>
<p>Christians,” would soon dominate Spain.’’® Juan de Ribera, Archbishop
of Valencia, presented memorials to Philip III (1602) urging the
expulsion of all Moriscos above seven years of age; the disasters that
had befallen Spain, including the destruction of the Armada, were (he
explained) God’s punishments for harboring infidels; these pretended
Christians should be deported, or sent to the galleys, or shipped to
America to work as slaves in the mines.*““ Over the warnings of the
Pope, and despite the protests of landlords who profited from their
Morisco tenants, Lerma is- sued (1609) an edict that — with some
exceptions — all Moors of Valencia province were to embark within three
days on ships provided for them and be transported to Africa, taking
with them only such goods as they could carry on their backs. The scenes
that had marked the expulsion of the Jews 117 years before were now
repeated. Desperate families found themselves forced to sell their
property at great losses; they marched in misery to the ports; many were
robbed, some were murdered, on the way or on board ship. Reaching
Africa, they rejoiced to touch Moslem soil, but two thirds of them died
of starvation there or were killed as Christians.’** During the winter
of 1609-10 similar expulsions cleared the other provinces of Moriscos;
altogether 400,000 of Spain’s most productive inhabitants were
expropriated and banished. In the eyes of the people this was the most
glorious accomplishment of the reign, and simple Spaniards looked
forward to a more prosperous era now that God had been appeased by
ridding Spain of infidels. The proceeds from the confiscation of Morisco
property rejoiced the court. Lerma pocketed 250,000 ducats, his son
100,000, his daughter and son-in-law 150,000.’*®</p>
<p>By 1618 the greed and carelessness of Lerma, the extravagance of the
King and the court, the venality of officials, and the disruption of the
econ- omy by the Morisco exodus had reduced Spain to a condition where
even the faineant King saw the need of a change. In a flurry of
resolution he dis- missed Lerma (1618), only to accept Lerma’s son, the
Duke of Uceda, as chief minister. Lerma retired gracefully, received a
cardinal’s hat, and</p>

<p>Xlived seven years more in piety and wealth. In 1621 the Council of
Castile warned the King that his realm was being “totally ruined and
destroyed owing to the excessive burdens, taxes and imposts,”^* and it
besought him to moderate his expenditures. He agreed — and then marched
off on a royal progress lavishly equipped and maintained. In that same
year he died, leav- ing to his son a realm enormous and impotent, a
government corrupt and incompetent, a populace reduced to destitution,
beggary, and theft, a no- bility too proud to pay taxes, and a Church
that had stifled the thought and broken the will of the people, and had
transmuted their superstitions into hoards of gold.</p>

<li>PHILIP IV: 1621-65</li>
</ol>
<p>The son differed from his father in everything but extravagance. We
know him externally from the many portraits of him by Velazquez: in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art at New York he is nineteen (1624), hand-
some, blond, already expanding; in the National Gallery at London he is
blithe and confident at twenty-seven, stout and somber at fifty; in the
Prado we can see him in five stages of glory and decay; he is also in
Flor- ence, Turin, Vienna, Cincinnati — he must have spent half his life
in</p>
<p>Velazquez’ studio. But those portraits show only his official fea
tures; he was not really so solemn and proud; we imagine him more justly
by study- ing his children in Velazquez’ portraits; presumably he loved
them beyond reason, as we do ours. In reahty he was a kindly man,
generous to artists, authors, and women; no semi-saint like his father,
but enjoying food and sex, plays and pictures, the court and the hunt,
and resolved to get the most out of life even in a dying Spain. Perhaps
because he savored life so fully, poetry and drama, painting and
sculpture flourished under him as never in Spain before or again. When
his pleasures seemed too promiscu- ous he multiplied his prayers, and he
relied on his good intentions to pave the road to heaven. He had
thirty-two natural children, of whom he ac- knowledged eight.^® Having
little time left for government, he delegated his powers and tasks to
one of the predominant personalities in the diplo- macy of the
seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The career of Don Caspar de Guzman, Count of Olivares, ran remark-
ably parallel and counter to Richelieu’s. For twenty -one years
(1621-42) the great Count played against the wily Cardinal a bloody game
of wits and war for the hegemony of Europe. Velazquez has revealed
Olivares to us without fear and without reproach, in all the pugnacity
of power, his prim mustachios curling like some ferocious scimitar, his
robes and bands and chains and keys of state proclaiming authority His
faults of imperial</p>
<p>CHAP, x) GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN 289</p>
<p>pride, quick irritability, and stern implacability alienated all but
those who knew, too, his dedicated zeal and industry in serving Spain,
his forthright honesty in a venal milieu, his contempt of worldly
pleasures except as de- vices to bemuse the King, his frugal board and
simple private life, his warm support of literature and art. He strove
sincerely to abate abuses, to stop corruption, to recapture past
peculations for the treasury, to moderate the cost of the royal
establishment, to enjoin economy and modesty in dress and equipage, even
to check the cruelty of the Inquisition. He took upon himself all the
burdens of administration, policy, diplomacy, and war. He began his
day’s labors before dawn and continued them when prostrate</p>
<p>We must not follow all the moves of that sanguinary chess; they add
nothing to our knowledge or estimation of mankind. It was a contest of
strength, not of principles, each side shelving religion for military
victory: Richelieu financing Protestant armies in Germany against
Catholic Austria, Olivares sending 300,000 ducats yearly to the Duke of
Rohan to prolong the Huguenot revolt in France.^^ In the end Spain was
crushed; her power on the seas was ended by the Dutch in the battle of
the Downs (1639), and her power on land was ended by the French at
Roussillon (1642) and Rocroi (1643 ). In Spain’s debility Portugal and
Catalonia wrenched them - selves free (1640); and for nineteen years the
Catalan Republic, aided by France, waged war against Castile. At last
the amiable King, who had trusted his minister through a hundred
calamities, reluctantly dismissed him (1643). Olivares fled from hostile
Madrid to voluntary exile in distant Toro; and there, two years later,
he died insane.</p>
<p>Philip now for a time took personal charge. He reduced his own
ex-</p>
<p>penditures and devoted himself conscientiously to government. But the
causes of Spain’s decline were beyond his understanding or control. War
continued, taxes were not lowered; production and population fell. At
the Peace of Westphalia (1648) Spain was helpless, and had to concede
independence to the United Provinces after nearly a century of wasted
war. The Peace of the Pyrenees (1659) gave official sanction to French
ascendancy in Europe. Amid these disasters Philip’s loyal and patient

followed by her sole surviving son, Don Baltasar Carlos, whom Velazquez
had pictured so alluringly. The King was left with only one legitimate
child, Maria</p>
<p>Teresa, whom he gave in marriage to Louis XIV. Longing for an
heir,</p>
<p>Philip, aged forty-four, married (1649) his fourteen-year-old niece,
Mari- ana of Austria, who had been betrothed to Baltasar. She rewarded
him with two sons: Philip Prosper, who died at the age of four, and the
future Carlos Segundo, Charles II. The tired King, racked with
gallstones, weak- ened with hemorrhages, and harassed by magic-mongering
monks, re- signed himself to death (1665), comforted with the thought of
an heir and spared the knowledge that his half-idiot son would bequeath
all Spain to France.</p>
<p>V. PORTUGAL: 1557-1668</p>
<p>Three events marked these years in Portugal: she lost and rewon her
independence, and Camoes wrote The Lusiads.</p>
<p>She shared with Spain the ecstasy of expansion and the ferocity
of</p>
<p>dogma, and preceded her in decline. The rapidity of her colonial
develop- ment had drained overseas her most enterprising sons;
agriculture was neg- lected or left to spiritless slaves; Lisbon reeked
with corrupt officials, covetous merchants, and penniless proletaires,
all living ultimately on im- perial exploitation or foreign trade. Young
King Sebastian, inspired by the Jesuits with religious zeal, proposed to
his uncle, Philip II, a joint con- quest and Christianization of
Morocco. Philip demurred, having his hands full; Sebastian proposed to
undertake the enterprise unaided; Philip warned him that the resources
of Portugal were too small for such a campaign; when Sebastian insi sted
Philip said to his Council, “If he wins, we shall have a good son-in-
law; if be loses, we shall have a good kingdom.”^® Sebastian invaded
Morocco and was overwhelmed and killed (1578) at the battle of

Cardinal Henry; but Henry himself died without issue in 1580, ending the
royal Aviz dynasty that had ruled Portugal since 1385.</p>
<p>This was the opportunity that Philip had waited for. As grandsons of
King Manuel of Portugal, he and Philibert Emmanuel of Savoy were the
most direct heirs to the vacant throne. The Cortes of Lisbon recognized
Philip; some rival claimants resisted his entry; the redoubtable Alva
over- came them; and in 1581 Philip II entered Lisbon as Philip I of
Portugal. By courtesy and bribery he strove to win the friendship of the
nation. He forbade his armies to pillage the countryside, and Alva
hanged so many of</p>

<p>his troops for such offenses that he feared a shortage of rope.
Philip prom- ised to keep Portuguese territory under Portuguese
administrators, to ap- point no Spaniards to office in Portugal, and to
maintain the privileges and liberties of the people. These promises were
kept as long as he lived. So, with astonishing ease, Philip inherited
the Portuguese navy and the Portu- guese colonies in Africa, Asia, and
South America. The old papal line of demarcation between Spanish and
Portuguese possessions disappeared; and the most powerful of European
kings, now made more powerful still, was ready to destroy himself by
invading England.</p>
<p>While Portugal’s empire was passing to Spain and the Dutch, her great
- est poet was singing the glory of her conquests. Again the barriers of
nationality and language defeat our desire to understand. How can those
who were not bred on Portuguese history, and who do not feel the sense
and music of Portuguese speech, do justice to Luiz Vaz de Camoes — our
Camoens?</p>
<p>He lived his song before writing it. One of his ancestors was a
soldier- poet like himself; his grandmother was a relative of Vasco da
Gama, who is the hero of The Liisiads; his father, a poor captain, was
shipwrecked near Goa, and died there shortly after Luiz was born in
Lisbon or Coimbra. The youth probably studied at the university, for his
poem rings with echoes of Catullus, Virgil, Horace, and Ovid. His
personal romance began in a church, in a moment of adoration: he saw a
beautiful woman with “snow - white face and hair of gold,” and was
stirred to poetry. Some of his lines must have offended the court; he
was banished to a village on the upper Tagus, and there dreamed of an
epic that “should increase the glor y of Portugal and make Smyrna
envious despite her being the birthplace of Horner.”^® The
unappreciative government sent him into exile or military service in
Ceuta, where, in battle or quarrel, he lost an eye. Back in Lisbon, he
defended some friends in a brawl, stabbed a courtier, was jailed for
eight months, and was released probably on his promise to enlist for
foreign service. On March 26, 1553, aged twenty-nine, he sailed for
India as a common soldier on the flagship of Fernao Alvares Cabral.</p>
<p>He bore the tedium of humid nights on the half-year voyage by com-
posing the first of two cantos of The Lusiads. In September his ship</p>
<p>reached Goa, the Portuguese Sodom in India. He took part in many cam-
paigns: on the Malabar Coast, off the shores of Arabia, at Mombasa, in
the East Indies, and at Macao, the Portuguese Sodom in China. He de-
scribes himself as brandishing a sword in one hand and a pen in the
other; his comrades called him Trincafortes — the Swashbuckler — and
probably respected his sword more than his pen. A grotto at Macao is
still shown as the place where Camoes wrote part of his poem. An
uncertain story</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xpictures him as brought back from A’lacao in chains, having been
arrested for causes now unknown. Another story (shedding his chains)
tells how his ship was wrecked off the Cambodian coast and Luiz swam
ashore with his epic between his teeth;®® in that wreck, however, he
lost his beloved Chinese concubine. After months of misery he found his
way to Goa, only to be cast into prison. Released, he was jailed again,
this time for debt. A friendly viceroy freed him, and for a brief
interlude the poet could enjoy life and a kaleidoscope of diversely
colored mistresses. In 1567 he borrowed money and took passage for
Portugal; his funds ran out in Mozambique, where he dallied in
destitution for two years. Some transient friends paid his debts and his
fare and brought him at last (1570) to Lisbon. His only possession was
his poem. King Sebastian gave him a modest pen- sion; the poem finally
reached print (1572), and Cam 5 es was allowed to live in penurious
peace for eight years. He died in Lisbon in 1580, and was buried with
other plague victims in a common grave. Portugal cele- brates his
anniversary, June 10, as a memorial holiday, and cherishes as its
national epic Os Lusiadas, whose title means “the Portuguese.” Camoes
took the term Lusia from the old Roman name for the western part of
Spain, Lusitania.</p>
<p>The meandering narrative winds itself about the historic voyage
(1497-99) of Vasco da Gama from Portugal around the Cape of Good Hope to
India. After an invocation to King Sebastian and the “nymphs of Tagus,”
the story proceeds with da Gama’s fleet up t he east coast of Africa.
Feeling an obliga- tion to imitate Homer and Virgil, the poet pictures a
conclave of the gods debating whether they should allow the expedition
to reach India. Bacchus votes No, and rouses the Moors of Mozambique to
attack the Portuguese who are landing for water. Venus intercedes with
Jupiter in the sailors’ behalf; the Moors are repulsed, and Mercury bids
da Gama to get along. The fleet stops on the Kenya coast and is
hospitably received; the native king falls into Camoes’ plan by asking
Vasco to tell him the history of Portugal. The admiral responds at
length, recounts the tragedy of Ines de Castro, describes the fate- ful
battle of Aljubarrota (1385), where the Portuguese first won their
freedom from Spain, and ends with the sailing of his own expedition from
Lisbon. As the new Argonauts cross the Indian Ocean Bacchus and Neptune
stir up a typhoon against them, and Camoes, having lived through such a
storm, rises to an exciting description. Venus stills the waves, and the
fleet triumphantly reaches Calicut.</p>
<p>On the return voyage Venus and her son Cupid arrange a feast for the
weary crew; at her bidding lovely Nereids rise out of the sea, load
palace tables with delicacies and flowers, and comfort the sailors with
food and drink and love.</p>
<p>What famished kisses were there in the wood!</p>
<p>What gentle sound of pretty lamentation!</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>GRANDEUR AND DECADENCE OF SPAIN</p>
<p>What sweet caress! What angry modest mood</p>
<p>That into bright mirth knew sweet transformation!</p>
<p>From dawn till noon such pleasures they pursued</p>
<p>As Venus kindled to a conflagration,</p>
<p>Which men would rather taste of than condemn.</p>
<p>Rather condemn who cannot taste of them.®^</p>
<p>Lest some such Portuguese should complain that these lines insulted
monogamy, Camoes assures us that the affair was quite allegorical, and
that the nymphs were “nothing more than honors . . . whereby life is
exalted and refined.”®^ In any case the sailors allegorically stumble
back to their ships, and the fleet finds its way back to Lisbon. The
poem concludes with a plea to the King to reward merit everywhere, and
not least this patriotic song.</p>
<p>Even through the mist of translation an alien can feel the rippling
music and lyrical ecstasies of this remarkable poem, the warm blood of a
soldier- poet who conveys to us the lusty mettle and adventurous history
of the Portuguese in those expansive days. Tasso is reported to have
named Camoes as the only contemporary poet against whom he would not
con- fidently measure himself; and Lope de Vega, when Spanish and
Portuguese were not so far apart as now, ranked The Lustads above both
The Iliad and The Aenetd.^^ Today the poem is a bond of unity, a flag of
pride and hope, w herever Camoes’ language is spoken — in lovely Lisbon,
in decadent Goa and Macao, in thriving, burgeoning, spirited Brazil.</p>
<p>Camoes, hearing that Philip was taking Portugal, is reported to have
said, almost as his last words, “I loved my country so much that I shall
die with her.”®^ So long as Philip lived, the captive country fared rea
- sonably well; but his successors violated his vows. Olivares proposed
to merge the two nations and languages into one; Spain took most of the
gains from Portugal’s c olonies and trade; and the English and the
Dutch, at war with Spain, captured or pillaged Portuguese as well as
Spanish possessions, markets, and fleets. Spaniards crowded into
Portuguese offices, Spanish ecclesiastics into Portuguese sees. The
Inquisition laid a pall upon Portuguese literature and thought.</p>
<p>Popular discontent rose as national income declined, until at last
the nobility and the clergy led the infuriated nation in revolt.
Encouraged by England and Richelieu, the patriots declared John, Duke of
Braganza, to be the King of Portugal (1640). France and the Dutch sent
protective fleets into the Tagus, and France pledged itself never to
make peace with Spain until the independence of Portugal was recognized.
Spain was so harassed with foreign war that she had hardly any men or
money to put down the resurgence of her neighbor; but when other
pressures eased</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>

<p>Xshe sent two armies, totaling 35,000 troops, against the new
government (1661). Portugal could raise only 13,000; but Charles II of
England, in return for Catherine of Braganza, a more beautiful dowry,
and a lucrative treaty of free trade with Portuguese ports in all
continents, dispatched to Portugal a force under the brilliant General
Friedrich Schomberg. The Spanish invaders were defeated at £vora (1663)
and Montes Claros</p>
<p>(1665), and in 1668 exhausted Spain acknowledged that Portugal was
free.</p>
