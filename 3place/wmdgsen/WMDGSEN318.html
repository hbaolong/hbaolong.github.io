<h4 id="chapter-xxxv">CHAPTER XXXV</h4>
<p>Abelard</p>
<p>1079-1 142</p>
<p>I. DIVINE PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>L ET us give a separate chapter to Abelard. Not merely as a
philosopher, j nor as one of the creators of the University of Paris,
nor as a flame that set the mind of Latin Europe afire in the twelfth
century; but as, with Helo- ise, part and personification of the morals
and literature and highest fascina- tion of their time.</p>
<p>He was born in Brittany, near Nantes, in the village of Le Pallet.
His</p>
<p>father, known to us only as Berenger, was the seigneur of a modest
estate, and could afford to give his three sons and one daughter a
liberal education. Pierre (we do not know the origin of his surname
Abelard) was the oldest, and could claim the rights of primogeniture;
but he felt so lively an interest in studies and ideas that, on growing
up, he surrendered to his brothers his claim and share in the family
.property, and set out to woo philosophy wher- ever a philosophic battle
raged, or some famous teacher taught. It meant much for his career that
one of his first masters was Jean Roscelin ( c . 1050- c. 1120), a rebel
who prefigured Abelard by drawing down upon his head the condemnation of
the Church.</p>
<p>The controversy that Roscelin had aroused stemmed from what seemed
the most harmless problem of the driest logic — the objective existence
of “universals.” In Greek and medieval philosophy a universal was a
general idea denoting a class of objects (book, stone, planet, man,
mankind, the French people, the Catholic Church), actions (cruelty,
justice), or qualities (beauty, truth). Plato, seeing the transitoriness
of individual organisms and things, had suggested that the universal is
more lasting, therefore more real, than any member of the class it
describes: beauty more real than Phryne, justice more real than
Aristides, man more real than Socrates; this is what the Middle Ages
meant by “realism.” Aristotle had countered that the universal is merely
an idea formed by the mind to represent a class of like objects; the
class itself exists, he thought, only as its constituent members. In our
time men have debated whether there is a “group mind” apart from the
desires, ideas, and feelings of the individuals composing the group; and
Hume argued that the individual “mind” itself is only an abstract name
for the series and collection of sensations, ideas, and volitions in an
organism. The Greeks did</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>932</p>
<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>not take the problem too much to heart; and one of the last pagan
philoso- phers — Porphyry ( c . 232-c. 304) of Syria and Rome — merely
phrased it without offering a solution; But to the Middle Ages the
question was vital. The Church claimed to be a spiritual entity
additional to the sum of her in- dividual adherents; the whole, she
felt, had qualities and powers beyond those of its parts; she could not
admit that she was an abstraction, and that the endless ideas and
relations suggested by the term “the Church” were nothing but ideas and
feelings in her constituent members; she was the living “bride of
Christ.” Worse yet: if only indivi dual persons, things, actions, and
ideas existed, what became of the Trinity? Was the unity of the three
Per- sons a mere abstraction; were they three separate gods? We must
place our- selves in his theological environment to understand the fate
of Roscelin.</p>
<p>We know his views only through the reports of his opponents. We are
told that he considered universals or general ideas to be mere words
(voces ) , mere winds of the voice (flatus vocis ) ; individual objects
and persons exist; all else is names (nomina). Genera and species and
qualities have no inde- pendent existence; man does not exist, only men;
color exists only in the form of colored things. The Church would
doubtless have let Roscelin alone had he not applied this “nominalism”
to the Tr inity. God, he is reported to have said, is a word applied to
the three Persons of the Trinity, just as man is ap- plied to many men;
but all that really exists is the three Persons — in effect, three gods.
This was to admit the polytheism of which Islam implicitly ac- cused
Christianity five times a day from a thousand minarets. The Church could
not allow such teaching in one who was a canon of the cathedral at
Compiegne. Roscelin was summoned before an episcopal synod at Soissons
(1092), and was given a choice between retraction and excommunication.
He retracted. He fled to England, attacked clerical concubinage there, 1
re- turned to France, and taught at Tours and Loches. It was probably at
Loches that Abelard sat impatiently at his feet. 2 Abelard rejected
nominalism, but it was for doubts about the Trinity that he was twice
condemned. It deserves also to be noted that the twelfth century called
realism “the ancient doc - trine,” and gave to its opponents the name of
moderni— modems. 8</p>
<p>The Church was ably defended by Anselm ( 103 3-1 109) in several
works that seem to have deeply moved Abelard, if only to opposition.
Anselm came of a patrician family in Italy; he was made Abbot of Bee in
Normandy in 1078; under his rule, as under that of Lanfranc, Bee became
one of the major schools of learning in the West. As perhaps ideally
described by his fellow monk Eadmer in a loving biography, Anselm was a
gentle ascetic who wished only to meditate and pray, and reluctantly
emerged from his cell to govern the monastery and its school. To such a
man, whose faith was his life, doubt was impossible; faith must come
long before understanding; and how could any finite mind expect ever to
understand God? “I do not seek to un - derstand in order to bel ieve,”
he said, following Augustine, “I believe in order</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) ABELARD 933</p>
<p>to understand.” But his pupils asked for arguments for use against
infidels; he himself considered it “negligent if, after we are confirmed
in our faith, we should not aim to understand what we have believed”; 4
he accepted the motto fides quaerens intellectum — imh in quest of
understanding; and in a series of immensely influential works he
inaugurated Scholastic philosophy by attempting a rational defense of
the Christian faith.</p>
<p>In a little treatise, Monologion, he argued for the objective
existence of universals: our notions of goodness, justice, and truth are
relative, and have meaning only by comparison with some absolute
goodness, justice, and truth; unless this Absolute exists we have no
certain standards of judgment, and our science and our morality alike
are baseless and void; God — objective goodness, justice, and truth — is
this saving Absolute, the necessary assump- tion of our lives. As if to.
carry this realism to the utmost, Anselm proceeded in his Proslogion
(c. 1074) to his famous ontological proof of the existence of God: God
is the most perfect being that we can conceive; but if He were merely an
idea in our heads He would lack one element of perfection — namely,
existence: therefore God, the most perfect being, exists. A modest monk,
Gaunilo, signing himself Insipiens (Fool), wrote to Anselm, protest- ing
that we cannot pass so magically from conception to existence, and that
an equally valid argument would prove the existence of a perfect island;
and Thomas Aquinas agreed with Gaunilo. 5 In another brilliant but
unconvinc- ing tract — Cur Dens homo? — Anselm sought some rational
ground for the fundamental Christian belief that God had become man. Why
was this in- carnation necessary? An opinion defended by Ambrose, Pope
Leo I, and several Fathers of the Church 6 held that by eating the
forbidden fruit Adam and Eve had sold themselves and all their progeny
to the Devil, and that only the death of God become man could ransom
humanity from Satan and hell. Anselm proposed a subtler argument: the
disobedience of our first parents was an infinite offense, because it
sinned against an infinite being, and dis- turbed the moral order of the
world; only an infinite atonement could bal- ance and wipe out that
infinite offense; only an infinite being could offer such infinite
atonement; God became man to restore the moral balance of the world.</p>
<p>The realism of Anselm was developed by one of Rosc elin’s pupils,
William of Champeaux (io7o?-ii2i). In 1103 William began to teach
dialectics in the cathedral school of Notre Dame at Paris. If we may
believe Abelard, who was too good a warrior to be a good historian,
William out-Platoed Plato, and held not only that universals are
objectively real, but that the individual is an incidental modification
of the generic reality, and exists solely by par- ticipating in the
universal; so humanity is the real being, which enters into, and thereby
gives existence to, Socrates. Moreover (William is reported to have
taught) the whole universal is present in every individual of its class;
all humanity is in Socrates, in Alexander.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>934</p>
<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>To William’s school Abelard came after much scholarly wandering</p>
<p>(1103?), aged twenty-four or twenty-five. He had a fine figure, a
proud car- riage, good looks, 7 an imposing breadth of brow; and the
vivacity of his spirit gave life and charm to his manners and speech. He
could compose songs and sing them; his lusty humor shook the cobwebs in
the dialectical halls; he was a gay and joyous youth who had discovered
at the same time Paris and philosophy. His defects were those of his
qualities: he was con- ceited, boastful, insolent, self-centered; and in
the exhilaration of his con- scious talent he rode with young
thoughtlessness over the dogmas and sensibilities of his masters and his
time. He was drunk with the “dear delight” of philosophy; this famous
lover loved dialectic more than he loved Heloise.</p>
<p>He was amused by the exaggerated realism of his teacher, and
challenged him in open class. All humanity present in Socrates? Then,
when all human- ity is in Alexander, Socrates (included in all humanity)
must be present in Alexander. Presumably William had meant that all the
essential elements of humanity are present in each human being; we have
not received William’s side of the argument. In any case Abelard would
have none of it. To Wil- liam’s realism, and to Roscelin’s nomi nalism,
he opposed what came to be called conceptualism. The class (man, stone)
physically exists only in the form of its constituent members (men,
stones) ; qualities (whiteness, good- ness, truth) exist only in the
objects, actions, or ideas that they qualify. But the class and the
quality are not mere names; they are concepts formed by our minds from
elements or features observed to be common to a group of individuals,
objects, actions, or ideas. These common elements are real, though they
appear only in individual forms. The concepts by which we think of these
common elements — the generic or universal ideas by which we think of
classes of like objects — are not “winds of voice,” but the most use -
ful and indispensable instruments of thought; without them science and
philosophy would be impossible.</p>
<p>Abelard remained with William, he tells us, “for some time.” Then he
himself began to teach, first at Melun, later at Corbeil, the one forty,
the other twenty-five, miles from Paris. Some criticized him for setting
up his own shop after too brief an apprenticeship, but a goodly number
of students followed him, relishing his quick mind and tongue. Meanwhile
William be- came a monk at St. Victor, and “by request” continued his
lectures there. To h im, after a “grievous illness,” Abelard returned as
a pupil; apparently there was more meat on the bones of William’s
philosophy than a hasty reading of Abelard’s brief autobiography
suggests. But soon their old debates were re - sumed; Abelard (in Abela
rd’s report) forced William to modify his realism, and William’s
prestige waned. His successor and appointee at Notre Dame now (1109?)
offered to yield his place to Abelard; William refused consent. Abelard
resumed lecturing at Melun, then on Mont Ste.-Genevieve, just out- side
Paris. Between him and William, and between their students, a war of</p>
<p>ABELARD</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>logic ran its wordy course for years; and Abelard, despite his
rejection of nominalism, became the leader and hero of the moderni , the
ardent young rebels of the “modern” school.</p>
<p>While he was so embattled, his father and mother entered religious
orders, presumably as a viaticum, and Abelard had to return to Le Pallet
to bid them Godspeed, and perhaps to settle some problems of property.
In 1 1 1 5, after a term of studying theology at Laon, Abelard returned
to Paris, and, apparently without opposition, established his school, or
lecture course, in those very cloisters of Notre Dame where he had
squatted as a student some twelve years before. He became a canon of the
cathedral, 8 though not yet a priest, and might look forward to
ecclesiastical dignities if he could hold his tongue. But it was a hard
condition. He had studied literature as well as phi- losophy, and was a
master of lucid and graceful exposition; like any French- man he
acknowledged a moral obligation to be clear; and he was not afraid to
let some humor lighten the burden of his speech. Students came from a
dozen countries to hear him; his classes were so large that they brought
him considerable money as well as international fame. 9 A letter written
to him a few years later by the Abbe Foulques bears witness:</p>
<p>Rome sent you her children to instruct. . . . Neither distance
nor</p>
<p>mountains nor valleys nor roads infested with brigands prevented the
youth of the world from coming to you. Young Englishmen crowded to your
classes across a dangerous sea; all quarters of Spain, Flanders, Germany
sent you pupils; and they were never tired of praising the</p>
<p>power of your mind. I say nothing of all the inhabitants of Paris,
and the most distant parts of France, which were also thirsty for
your</p>
<p>teaching, almost as if no science existed which could not be learned
from you. 10</p>
<p>From that height and splendor of success and renown why should he not
move on to a bishopric (as William had done), then to an archbishopric?
Why not to the papacy?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>HELOISE</li>
</ol>
<p>Up to this time (1 1 17?), he doth protest, he had maintained “the
utmost continence,” and “had diligently refrained from all excesses.” 11
But in the maiden Heloise, niece of the cathedral canon Fulbert, there
was a comeli- ness of person, and a flair for learning, which aroused
the sensitivity of his manhood and the admiration of his mind. During
those hectic years when Abelard and William fought the universal war,
Heloise had grown from in- fancy to girlhood as an orphan of whose
parentage no certain trace remains. Her uncle sent her for many years to
a convent at Argenteuil; there, falling in love with the books in the
little library, she became the brightest pupil the</p>
<p>93 6 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>nuns had ever had. When Fulbert learned that she could converse in
Latin as readily as in French, and was even studying Hebrew, 12 he took
new pride in her, and brought her to live with him in his home near the
cathedral. She was sixteen when Abelard came into her life (1117).
Presumably she had heard of him long since; she must have seen the
hundreds of students who crowded the cloisters and lecture rooms to hear
him; perhaps, so intel- lectually eager, she had gone openly or
furtively to see and hear the idol and paragon of the scholars of Paris.
We can imagine her modest trepidation when Fulbert told her that Abelard
was to live with them and be her tutor. The philosopher himself gives
the frankest explanation of how it had come about:</p>
<p>It was this young girl whom I . . . determined to unite with
myself</p>
<p>in the bonds of love. And indeed the thing seemed to me very easy to
be done. So distinguished was my name, and I possessed such advan- tages
of youth and comeliness, that no matter what woman I might favor with my
love, I dreaded rejection of none. . . . Thus, utterly</p>
<p>aflame with passion for this maiden, I sought to discover means</p>
<p>whereby I might have daily and familiar speech with her, thereby the
more easily to win her consent. For this purpose I persuaded the girl’s
uncle … to take me into his household … in return for the payment of a
small sum. . . . He was a man keen in avarice, and . . . believed that
his niece would vastly benefit from my teaching. . . . The man’s sim -
plicity was nothing short of astounding; I should not have been more
surprised if he had entrusted a tender lamb to the care of a ravenous
wolf. . . .</p>
<p>Why should I say more? We were united, first in the dwelling that</p>
<p>sheltered our love, and then in the hearts that burned within us.</p>
<p>Under the pretext of study we spent our hours in the happiness of</p>
<p>love. . . . Our kisses outnumbered our reasoned words; our hands</p>
<p>sought less the book than each other’s bosoms; love drew our eyes</p>
<p>together. 13</p>
<p>What had begun with his simple physical desire graduated through</p>
<p>Heloise’s delicacy into “a tenderness surpassing in sweetness the
most fra - grant balm.” It was a new experience for him, and wooed him
quite from philosophy; he borrowed passion from his lectures for his
love, and left them anomalously dull. His students mourned the
dialectician, but welcomed the lover; they were delighted to learn that
even Socrates could sin; they con- soled themselves for lost jousts of
argument by singing the love songs that he now composed; and Heloise
from her windows could hear on their lips the boisterous echo of his
enchantment. 14</p>
<p>Not long afterward she announced to him that she was with child. Se-
cretly by night he stole her from her uncle’s house, and sent her to his
sister’s home in Brittany. 15 Half from fear and half from pity, he
offered to the in- furiated uncle to marry Heloise provided Fulbert
would let him keep the</p>
<p>ABELARD</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>937</p>
<p>marriage secret. The canon agreed, and after his classes had
adjourned Abe- lard went to Brittany to fetch a tender but unwilling
bride. Their son, Astro- labe, was three days old when he arrived.
Heloise long refused to marry him. The reforms of Leo IX and Gregory
VII, a generation back, had barred mar- ried men from the priesthood
unless the wife became a nun; she was not ready to contemplate such a
surrender of her mate and her child; she pro- posed to remain his
mistress, on the ground that such a relationship, kept judiciously
secret, would not, like marriage, close his road to advancement in the
Church . 16 A long passage in Abelard’s History of My Calamities (vii)
ascribes to Heloise at this point a learned array of authorities and
instances against the marriage of philosophers, and an eloquent plea
against “robbing the Church of so shining a light”: “Remember that
Socrates was wedded, and with how sordid a case he first purged that
stain on philosophy, that thereafter other men might be more prudent.”
“It would be far sweeter for her,” he reports her as saying, “to be
called my mistress than to be known as my wife; nay, this would be more
honorable for me as well.” 17 He per suaded her by promising that the
marriage would be known only to an intimate few.</p>
<p>They left Astrolabe with the sister, returned to Paris, and were
married in the presence of Fulbert. To keep the marriage secret Abelard
went back to his bachelor lodgings, and Heloise lived again with her
uncle; the lovers saw each other now only rarely and clandestinely. But
Fulbert, anxious to redeem his prestige, and overruling his promise to
Abelard, divulged the marriage. Heloise denied it, and Fulbert “visited
h er repeatedly with pun- ishments.” Abelard again stole her away; this
time he sent her, much against her will, to the convent at Argenteuil,
and bade her don the garb of a nun, but not to take the vows or the
veil. When Fulbert and his kinsmen heard of this, says Abelard,</p>
<p>they were convinced that now I had completely played them false,</p>
<p>and had rid myself forever of Heloise by forcing her to become a</p>
<p>nun. Violently incensed, they laid a plot against me; and one
night,</p>
<p>while … I was asleep in a secret room in my lodgings, they broke
in</p>
<p>with the help of one of my servants whom they had bribed. There</p>
<p>they had vengeance upon me with a most cruel and shameful punish-
ment . . . for they cut off those parts of my body whereby I had done
that which was the cause of their sorrow. This done, they fled; but</p>
<p>two of them were captured, and suffered the loss of their eyes
and</p>
<p>their genitals . 18</p>
<p>His enemies could not have chosen a subtler revenge. It did not
immedi- ately disgrace him; all Paris, including the clergy, sympathized
with him ; 19 his students flocked to comfort him. Fulbert shrank into
hiding and oblivion, and the bishop confiscated his property. But
Abelard realized that he was ruined, and that “the tale of this amazing
outrage would sp read to the very ends of the earth.” He could no longer
think of ecclesiastical preferment.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>He felt that his fair fame had been “utterly blotted out,” and that
he would be a butt of jokes for generations to come. He felt a certain
unpoetic justice in his fall: he had been maimed in the flesh that had
sinned, and had been betrayed by the man whom he had betrayed. He bade
Helolse take the veil, and he himself, at St. Denis, took the vows of a
monk.</p>

<p>A year later (1 120), at the urging of his students and his abbot, he
re- sumed his lecturing, in a “cell” of the Benedictine priory of
Maisoncelle. Presumably we have the substance of his lecture courses in
his books. These, however, were composed in hectic installments, and
hardly allow dating; they were revised in his final years, when his
spirit was quite broken, and there is no telling how much youthful fire
was quenched by the flow of time. Four minor logical works circle about
the problem of universal; we need not disturb their rest. The
Dialectica, however, is a 375-page treatise on logic in the Aristotelian
sense: a rational analysis of the parts of speech, the categories of
thought (substance, quantity, place, position, time, relation, quality,
pos- session, action, “passion”), the forms of propositions, and the
rules of reason - ing; the renascent mind of Western Europe had
toclarify these basic ideas for itself like a child learning to read.
Dialectic was the major interest of philoso- phy in Abelard’s time,
partly because the new philosophy stemmed from Aristotle through
Boethius and Porphyry, and only the logical treatises of Aristotle (and
not all of these) were known to this first generation of Scho- lastic
philosophy. So the Dialectica is not a fascinating book; yet even in its
formal pages we hear a shot or two in the first skirmishes of a Two
Hundred Years’ War between faith and reason. How can we, in an age
already doubt - ful of the intellect, recapture the glow of a time that
was just discovering “this great mystery of knowledge”? 20 Truth cannot
be contrary to truth, Abelard pleads; the truths of Scripture must agree
with the findings of rea- son, else the God who gave us both would be
deluding us with one or the other. 21</p>
<p>Perhaps in his early period — before his tragedy — he wrote his
Dialogue Between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian. “In a vision of
the night,” he says, three men came to him as a famous teacher, and
asked his judgment on their dispute. All three believe in one God; two
accept the Hebrew Scrip- tures; the philosopher rejects these, and
proposes to base life and morality on reason and natural law. How
absurd, argues the philosopher, to cling to the beliefs of our
childhood, to share the superstitions of the crowd, and to con- demn to
hell those who do not accept these puerilities! 22 He ends unphilo-
sophically by calling Jews fools, and Christians lunatics. The Jew
replies that men could not live without laws; that God, like a good
king, gave man a</p>
<p>ABELARD</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>939</p>
<p>code of conduct; and that the precepts of the Pentateuch sustained
the cour- age and morality of the Jews through centuries of dispersion
and tragedy. The philosopher asks, How, then, did your patriarchs live
so nobly, long be- fore Moses and his laws? — and how can you believe in
a revelation that promised you earthly prosperity, and yet has allowed
you to suffer such poverty and desolation? The Christian accepts much
that the philosopher and the Jew have said, but he argues that
Christianity developed and per- fected the natural law of the one and
the Mosaic law of the other; Christi- anity raised higher than ever
before the moral ideals of mankind. Neither philosophy nor scriptural
Judaism offered man eternal happiness; Christi- anity gives harassed man
such a hope, and is therefore infinitely precious. This unfinished
dialogue is an amazing product for a cathedral canon in the Paris of
1120.</p>
<p>A like freedom of discussion found anoth er medium in Abelard’s most
famous work, Sic et non — Yes and No ( 1 1 20? ) . The earliest known
mention of it is in a letter from William of St. Thierry to St. Bernard
( 1 140) , describ- ing it as a suspicious book secretly circulating
among the pupils and partisans of Abelard. 23 Thereafter it disappeared
from history until 1836, when the manuscript was discovered by Victor
Cousin in a library at Avranches. Its very form must have made the
mitered grieve. After a pious introduction it divided into 157
questions, including the most basic dogmas of the faith; under each
question two sets of quotations were ranged in opposite col- umns; one
set supported the affirmative, the other the negative; and each set
quoted from the Bible, the Fathers of the Church, the pagan classics,
even from Ovid’s Art of Loving (Ars amandi ) . The book may have been
intended as an armory of references for scholastic disputation; but the
introduction, purposely or not, impugned the authority of the Fathers by
showing them in contradiction of one another, even of themselves.
Abelard did not question the authority of the Bible; but he argued that
its language was meant for unlettered people, and must be interpreted by
reason; that the sacred text had sometimes been corrupted by
interpolation or careless copying; and that where scriptural or
patristic passages contradicted one another, reason must attempt their
reconciliation. Anticipating the “Cartesian doubt” by 400 years, he
wrote in the same prologue: “The first key to wisdom is assiduous and
frequent questioning. … For by doubting we come to inquiry, and by
inquiry we arrive at the truth.” 24 He points out that Jesus Himself,
facing the doctors in the Temple, plied them with questions. The first
debate in the book is almost a declaration of independence for
philosophy: “That faith should be founded in human reason, and the
contrary.” He quotes Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory I as defending
faith, and cites Hilary, Jerome, and Augustine to the effect that it is
good to be able to prove one’s faith by rea - son. While repeatedly
affirming his orthodoxy, Abelard opens up for debate such problems as
Divine Providence vs. free will, the existence of sin and evil</p>
<p>94 ° THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>in a world created by a good and omnipotent God, and the possibility
that God is not omnipotent. His free reasoning about such questions must
have shaken the faith of youthful students enamored of debate.
Nevertheless this method of education by the freest discussion became,
probably through Abelard’s example, 25 the regular procedure at French
universities and in philosophical or theological writing; we shall find
St. Thomas adopting it without fear and without reproach. In the very
birth of Scholasticism ra- tionalism found a place.</p>
<p>If the Sic et non offended only a few because its circulation was
limited, Abelard’s attempt to apply reason to the mystery of the Trinity
could not so narrowly confine its influence and alarm, for it was the
subject of his lec- tures in 1120, and of his book On the Divine Unity
and Trinity. He wrote this, he says,</p>
<p>for my students, because they were always seeking for rational
and</p>
<p>philosophical explanations, asking rather for reasons they could un-
derstand than for mere words, saying that it was futile to utter</p>
<p>words which the intellect could not possibly follow, that nothing</p>
<p>could be believed unless it could first be understood, and that it
was absurd for anyone to preach to others a thing which neither he him-
self, nor those whom he sought to teach, could comprehend. 26</p>
<p>This book, he tells us, “became exceedingly popular,” and people
marveled at his subtlety. He pointed out that the unity of God was the
one point agreed upon by the greatest religions and the greatest
philosophers. In the one God we may view His power as the First Person,
His wisdom as the Second, His grace, charity, and love as the Third;
these are phases or modali- ties of the Divine Essence; but all the
works of God suppose and unite at once His power, His wisdom, and His
love. 27 Many theologians felt that this was a permissible analogy; the
bishop of Paris rejected the appeal of the now aged and orthodox
Roscelin to indict Abelard for heresy; and Bishop Geoffroy of Chartres
defended Abelard through all the fury that now fell upon the reckless
philosopher. But in Reims two teachers — Alberic and Lo- tulphe — who
had quarreled with Abelard at Laon in 1113, stirred up the</p>
<p>ABELARD</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>94 1</p>
<p>After a turbulent year with the unruly monks there, Abelard secured
per- mission from the new abbot, the great Suger, to build himself a
hermitage in a lonely spot halfway between Fontainebleau and Troyes
(1122). There, with a companion in minor orders, he raised with reeds
and stalks a little oratory or place of prayer, which he called by the
name of the Holy Trinity. When students heard that he was free to teach
again they came to him and made themselves into an impromptu school;
they built huts in the wilderness, slept on rushes and straw, and lived
on “coarse bread and the herbs of the field.” 29 Here was a thirst for
knowledge that would soon make and crowd universities; now, indeed, the
Dark Ages were a nightmare almost forgotten. In return for his lectures
the students tilled the field, raised buildings, and built him a new
oratory of timber and stone, which he called the Paraclete, as if to say
that the affection of his disciples had come like a holy spirit into his
life just when he had fled from human society to solitude and
despair.</p>
<p>The three years that he spent there were as happy as any that he
could now know. Probably the lectures that he gave to those eager
students are preserved and reshaped in two books, one called Theologia
Christiana , the other simply Theologia. Their doctrine was orthodox,
but an age still a stran- ger to most of Greek philosophy was a bit
shocked to find in them so many laudatory references to pagan thinkers,
and a suggestion that Plato too had in some degree enjoyed divine
inspiration . 30 He could not believe that all these wonderful
pre-Christian minds had missed salvation; 31 God, he in- sisted, gives
His love to all peoples, Jews and heathen included . 32 Abelard
impenitently returned to the defense of reason in theology, and argued
that heretics should be restrained by reason rather than by force . 33
Those who recommend faith without understanding are in many cases
seeking to cover up their inability to teach the faith intelligibly: 34
here was a barb that must have pierced some skins! In attempting a
rationale of Christianity Abelard might seem to have dared no more than
what Alexander of Hales, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas would essay
after him; but whereas even the brave Thomas would leave the Trinity,
and the creation in time, to a faith beyond or above reason, Abelard
sought to embrace the most mystic doc- trines of the Church within the
grasp of reason.</p>
<p>The audacity of the enterprise, and the sharpness of his reviving
wit, brought him new enemies. Probably referring to Bernard of
Clairvaux, and Norbert, founder of the Premonstratensian Order, he
writes:</p>
<p>Certain new apostles in whom the world put great faith ran hither</p>
<p>and yon . . . shamelessly slandering me in every way they could,
so</p>
<p>that in time they succeeded in drawing down upon my head the</p>
<p>scorn of many having authority. . . . God is my witness that
when-</p>
<p>soever I learned that a new assemblage of the clergy was convened, I
believed that it was done for the express purpose of my condemna- tion .

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>942</p>
<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>Perhaps to silence such criticism he abandoned his teaching, and
accepted an invitation to be the abbot of the monastery of St. Gildas in
Brittany (1125?); more likely the politic Suger had arranged the
transfer in the hope of quiet- ing the storm. It was at once a promotion
and an imprisonment. The phi- losopher found himself amid a “barbarous”
and “unintelligible” population, among monks “vile and untamable,” who
openly lived with concubines. 36 Resenting his reforms, the monks put
poison in the chalice from which he drank at Mass; this failing, they
bribed his servant to poison his food; another monk ate the food and
“straightway fell dead”; 37 but Abelard is our sole authority here. He
fought this battle bravely enough, for, with some inter- ruptions, he
remained in this lonely post for eleven years.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE LETTERS OF HELOISE</li>
</ol>
<p>He had an interlude of moderate happiness when Suger decided to use
for other purposes than a nunnery the house at Argenteuil. Since her
separation from Abelard Heloi’se had so devoted herself there to her
duties as a nun that she had been made prioress, and had won “such favor
in the eyes of all . . . that the bishops loved her as a daughter, the
abbots as a sister, and the laity as a mother.” Learning that Heloi’se
and her nuns were looking for new quarters, Abelard offered them the
oratory and buildings of “the Paraclete.”</p>
<p>It was during his troubled abbacy at St. Gildas that he composed his
auto- biography — Historia calamitatum mearum (1133?). We do not know
its mo- tive; it assumed the guise of an essay in consolation offered to
a plaintive friend, “so that, in comparing your sorrows with mine, you
may discover that yo urs are in truth naught”; but apparently it was
intended for the world, as both a moral confession and a theological
defense. An old but unverifiable tradition says that a copy of it came
to Heloi’se, and that she wrote this aston- ishing reply:</p>
<p>To her master, nay father, to her husband, nay brother: his hand-</p>
<p>maid, nay daughter, his spouse, nay sister: to Abelard, Heloi’se.
Your letter written to a friend for his comfort, beloved, was lately

<p>speech and presence, nor comforted by a letter in thine absence. Tell
me one thing only, if thou canst, or let me tell thee what I feel,
nay,</p>
<p>what all suspect: concupiscence joined thee to me rather than affec-
tion When, therefore, what thou hadst desired ceased, all that thou</p>
<p>hadst exhibited at the same time failed. This, most beloved, is not
mine only but the conjecture of all. . . . Would that it seemed thus to
me</p>

<p>Abelard was physiologically incapacitated from responding to such
pas- sion in kind. The reply that tradition assigns to him is a reminder
of religious vows: “To Heloise his dearly beloved sister in Christ,
Abelard her brother - ing and saving punishment from God. He asks for
her prayers, bids her as- suage her grief with the hope of their reunion
in heaven, and begs her to bury</p>

<p>him, when he is dead, in the grounds of the Paraclete. Her second
letter repeats her fond impieties: “I have ever f eared to offend thee
rather than God, I seek to please thee more than Him. . . . See how
unhappy a life I must lead, if I endure all these things in vain, having
no hope of reward in the future. For a long time thou, like many others,
hast been deceived by my simulation, so as to mistake hypocrisy for
religion.” 40 He answers that</p>
<p>satisfied my wretched desires in thee, and this was all that I loved
Weep</p>
<p>for thy Saviour, not for thy seducer; for thy Redeemer, not for thy
de- filer.” 41 And he composes a touching prayer which he asks her to
recite for him. Her third letter shows her resigned to the earthly death
of his love; she asked him now only for a new rule by which she and her
nuns might live properly the religious life. He complied, and drew up
for them a kindly mod- erate code. He wrote sermons for their
edification, and sent these composi- tions to Heloise over a tender
signature: “Farewell in the Lord to His serv - ant, once dear to me in
the world, now most dear in Christ.” In his own broken heart he still
loved her.</p>
<p>Are these famous letters genuine? The difficulties leap to the eye.
The first letter of Heloise purports to follow upon his Historia
calamitatum, which records several visits of Abelard to Heloise at the
Paraclete; yet she com- plains that he has ignored her. Possibly the
Historia was issued in install- ments, and only the earlier parts
preceded the letter. The bold carnality of certain passages seems
incredible in a woman whose religicus devotion through fourteen years
had already earned her the high and general regard which we find
attested by Peter the Venerable as well as by Abelard. There are
artifices of rhetoric in these letters, and pedantic quotations from the
classics and the Fathers, which would hardly occur to a mind sincerely
feel- ing love or piety or remorse. The oldest manuscripts of the
letters date from the thirteenth century. Jean de Meung appears to have
translated them from Latin into French in 1285. 42 We may provisionally
conclude that they are among the most brilliant forgeries in history,
unreliable in fact, but an im- perishable part of the romantic
literature of France. 43</p>
<p>V. THE CONDEMNED</p>
<p>We do not know when or how Abelard escaped from the dignities and
trials of his abbacy. We find John of Salisbury reporting that in 1 1 36
he had attended Abelard’s lectures on Mont Ste. -Genevieve. Nor do we
know by what license he had resumed his teaching; perhaps he had asked
none. It may be that some flouting of Church discipline set
ecclesiastics against him, and by a devious route led to his final
fall.</p>
<p>ABELARD</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>If emasculation had unmanned him there is no sign of it in the works
that have transmitted to us the substance of his teaching. It is
difficult to find ex- plicit heresy in them, but easy to discover
passages that must have made churchmen fret. In a book of moral
philosophy entitled Scito te ipsurn (Know Thyself ) he argued that sin
lies not in the act but in the intention; no act — not even killing — is
sinful in itself. So a mother, having too little clothing to warm her
babe, pressed it against her bosom and unwittingly suffocated it; she
killed the thing she loved, and was properly punished by the law to make
other women more careful; but in the eyes of God she was sinless.
Furthermore, that there should be sin, the agent must violate his own
moral conscience, not merely that of others. Hence the killing of
Christian mar- tyrs was not a sin in Romans who felt such persecution
necessary to the preservation of their state or of a religion which
seemed to them true. Nay, “those even who persecuted Christ or His
followers, whom they considered it their duty to persecute, are said to
have sinned in action; but they would have committed a graver fault if,
contrary to their conscience, they had spared them.” 44 All this might
be logical as well as irritating; but on such a theory the whole
doctrine of sin as a violation o f God’s law threatened to go up in a
haze of casuistry about intentions; who but a few Pauls would admit that
he had acted against his own conscience? Of the sixteen excerpts for
which Abelard was condemned in 1 141 , six were taken from this
book.</p>
<p>What disturbed the Church more than any specific heresy in Abelard
was his assumption that there were no mysteries in the faith, that all
dogmas should be capable of rational explanation. Was he not so drunk
with the lees of logic that he had dared to connect it with the Logos,
the Word of God, as a science almost divine? 45 Granted that this
seductive teacher arrived by unorthodox methods at orthodox conclusions;
how many immature minds, infected by him with the logic-chopping germ,
must have been, by his spe- cious pros and cons, unsettled on the way!
If he had been the only one of his kind he might have been left
untouched, in the hope that he would not take too long to die. But he
had hundreds of eager followers; and there were other teachers — William
of Conches, Gilbert de la Porree, Berenger of Tours — who were also
summoning the faith to trial by reason. How long, on this procedure,
could the Church maintain that unity and fervor of religious belief on
which the moral and social order of Europe seemed to rest? Al- ready one
of Abelard’s pupils, Arnold of Brescia, was fomenting revolution in
Italy.</p>
<p>Probably it was considerations like these that finally brought
St. Bernard into open war with Abelard. The eager watchdog of the faith
scented the wolf at the flock, and led the pack to the hunt. He had long
looked with distrust upon the prowling, invading, audacious intellect;
to seek knowledge except as ministering to sanctity seemed to him plain
paganism; to attempt to explain the sacred mysteries by reason was
impiety and folly; and the</p>
<p>94&lt;S the age of faith (chap, xxxv</p>
<p>same rationalism that began by explaining those mysteries would end
by desecrating them. The saint was not truculent; when ( 1 1 39) William
of St. Thierry, a monk of Reims, called his attention to the dangers in
Abelard’s teaching, and begged him to denounce the philosopher, he put
the monk off and did nothing. Abelard himself precipitated matters by
writing to the archbishop of Sens, asking that at the coming church
council there he should be given an opportunity to defend himself
against the charges of heresy that were being circulated about him. The
archbishop agreed, not unwilling to have his see become the cynosure of
the Christian world; and to ensure a good fight he invited Bernard to
attend. Bernard refused, saying that in the dialectical game he would be
“a mere child” against an Abelard trained in logic through forty years.
But he wrote to several bishops, urging them to attend and defend the
faith:</p>
<p>Peter Abelard is trying to make void the merit of Christian faith</p>
<p>when he deems himself able by human reason to comprehend God</p>
<p>altogether. He ascends to the heavens and descends even to the abyss;
nothing may hide from him! . . . Not content to see things through a
glass darkly, he must behold all things face to face. . . . He savors
of</p>
<p>Arius when he speaks of the Trinity, of Pelagius when he speaks
of</p>
<p>grace, of Nestorius when he speaks of the person of Christ. . . .
The</p>
<p>faith of the righteous believes, it does not dispute. But this man
has no mind to believe what his reason has not previously argued. 46</p>
<p>Bernard’s allies, pleading their own weakness, prevailed upon him to
at - tend. When Abelard arrived at Sens (June, r 140) he found the
public mood, as at Soissons nineteen years before, so set against him by
the mere presence and hostility of Bernard that he hardly dared appear
in the streets. The arch- bishop realized his dream; for a week Sens
seemed the center of the world; the king of France was present with his
ceremonious court; scores of church dignitaries were on hand; and
Bernard, crippled with rheumatism and stern with sanctity, overawed all.
Some of these prelates had felt the sting, in person or collectively, of
Abelard’s atta cks upon the shortcomings of the clergy, the immorality
of priests and monks, the sale of indulgences, the invention of bogus
miracles. Convinced that the judgment of the council would condemn him,
Abelard appeared at its first session, announced that he would accept
none but the Pope as his judge, and left the assembly and the town. The
council was not sure, after this appeal from it, that it could legally
try Abelard; Bernard reassured it; and it proceeded to condemn six- teen
propositions from Abe lard’s books, including his definition of sin, and
his theory of the Trinity as the power, wisdom, and love of the one
God.</p>
<p>Almost penniless, Abelard set out for Rome to lay his case before the
Pope. Age and infirmity retarded him. Reaching the monastery of Cluny in
Burgundy, he was received with compassion and solicitude by Peter the
Venerable, and rested there a few days. Meanwhile Innocent II issued a
de-</p>
<p>ABELARD</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>947</p>
<p>cree confirming the sentence of the council, imposing perpetual
silence upon Abelard, and ordering his confinement in a monastery.
Abelard wished nevertheless to continue his pilgrimage; Peter dissuaded
him, saying that the Pope would never decide against Bernard. Weary to
physical and spiritual exhaustion, Abelard yielded. He became a monk at
Cluny, and hid himself in the obscurity of its walls and its ritual. He
edified his fellow monks by his piety, his silence, and his prayers. He
wrote to Heloise — whom he never saw again — a touching profession of
faith in the teachings of the Church. He composed, probably for her,
some of the most beautiful hymns in me- dieval literature. One “Plaint”
ascribed to him is formally a Lament of David for Jonathan, but any
reader will catch tender overtones in it:</p>
<p>Vel confossus pariter</p>
<p>morerer feliciter</p>
<p>cum, quid amor faciat,</p>
<p>maius hoc non habeat,</p>
<p>et me post te vivere</p>
<p>mori sit assidue;</p>
<p>nec ad vitam anima</p>
<p>satis sit dimidia. . . .</p>
<p>If I might lie in one same grave with thee,</p>
<p>Happily would I die,</p>
<p>Since of all gifts that earthly love can give</p>

<p>Would be unceasing death;</p>
<p>Nor in my wraith would half a soul suffice</p>
<p>To life, or half a breath.</p>

<p>Would that I might</p>

<p>With grief. My spirit faints.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter he fell ill, and his kindly Abbot sent him to the
priory of St. Marcel near Chalons for a change of air. There, on April
21, 1142, he died, aged sixty-three. He was buried in the priory chapel;
but Heloise reminded Peter the Venerable that Abelard had asked to be
interred at the Paraclete. The good Abbot brought the body to her
himself, tried to com- fort her by speaking of her dead lover as the
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle of his time, and left with her a letter
rich in Christian tenderness:</p>
<p>Thus, dear and venerable sister in God, him to whom you were</p>
<p>united, after your tie in the flesh, by the better and stronger bond
of divine love, and with whom . . . you have served the Lord, him
the</p>
<p>Lord now takes in your stead, or as another you, and warms in His</p>
<p>bosom; and for the day of His coming, when shall sound the voice of
the archangel and the trumpet descending from heaven, He keeps him to
restore him to you by His grace. 48</p>
<p>She joined her dead lover in 1 1 64, having lived to equal his age,
and almost his fame. She was buried beside him in the gardens of the
Paraclete. That</p>
