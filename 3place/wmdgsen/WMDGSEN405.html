<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>The Political Collapse</p>
<p>1494-1534</p>
<p>I. FRANCE DISCOVERS ITALY: I494-5 1</p>
<p>R ECALL the situation of Italy in 1494. The city-states had grown</p>
<p>through the rise of a middle class enriched by the development and
management of commerce and industry. They had lost their communal
freedom through the inability of semidemocratic governments to maintain
order amid the feuds of families and the conflicts of classes. Their</p>
<p>economy remained local in structure even while their fleets and
products reached out to distant ports. They competed with one another
more bit- terly than with foreign states; they offered no concerted
resistance to the expansion of French, German, and Spanish commerce into
regions once dominated by Italy. Though Italy gave birth to the man who
rediscovered America, it was Spain that financed him; trade followed in
his wake, gold accompanied his return; the Atlantic nations flourished,
and the Mediter- ranean ceased to be the fa vored home of the white
man’s economic life. Portugal was sending ships around Africa to India
and China, avoiding Moslem hindrances in the Near and Middle East; even
the Germans were shipping through the mouths of the Rhine rather than
over the Alps to Italy. Countries that had for a century bought Italian
woolen products were now making their own; nations that had paid
interest to Italian bank- ers were nursing their own financiers. Tithes,
annates, Peter’s Pence, in - dulgence payments, and pilgrim s’ coins
were now the chief economic contribution of transalpine Europe to Italy;
and soon a third of Europe would divert that flow. In this generation
when the stored-up wealth of Italy raised her cities to their supreme
brilliance and art, Italy was eco- nomically doomed.</p>
<p>She was also politically doomed. While she remained divided into war-
ring economies and states, the development of a national economy was
compelling and financing, in other European societies, the transition
from feudal principalities to the monarchical state. France unified
herself under Louis XI, reducing her barons to courtiers and her
burghers to patriots;</p>
<p>609</p>
<p>6X0 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Spain unified herself by wedding Ferdinand of Aragon to Isabella of
Cas- tile, and conquering Granada, and cementing religious unity with
blood; England unified herself under Henry VII; and though Germany was
al- most as fragmentary as Italy, it acknowledged one king and emperor,
and occasionally gave him money and soldiers to make war upon one or an-
other of the Italian states. England, France, Spain, and Germany raised
national armies out of their own people, and their aristocracies
provided cavalry and leadership; the Italian cities had small forces of
mercenaries inspired only by plunder, led by purchasable condottieri,
and prejudiced against sustaining mortal injuries. It needed only one
engagement to re- veal to Europe the defenselessness of Italy.</p>
<p>Half the courts of Europe now seethed with diplomatic intrigue as to
which should seize the plum. France claimed the first right, and with
many reasons. Giangaleazzo Visconti had given his daughter Valentina in
marriage (1387) to Louis, first Duke of Orleans, and, as the price of
this comforting connection with a royal family, had recognized her
right, and the right of her male issue, to succeed to the duchy of Milan
in case his own direct male line should fail; which it did when Filippo
Maria Visconti died (1447). His son-in-law, Francesco Sforza, then took
Milan by right of his wife Bianca, Filippo Maria’s daughter; but
Charles, Duke of Orleans, claimed Milan as Valentina’s son, denounced
the Sforzas as usurpers, and proclaimed his resolve, when opportunity
should offer, to appropriate the Italian principality.</p>
<p>Moreover, said the French, Charles, Duke of Anjou, had received the
Kingdom of Naples from Pope Urban IV (1266) as reward for defending the
papacy against the Hohenstaufen kings; Joanna II had bequeathed the
Kingdom to Rene of Anjou (1435); Alfonso I of Aragon had claimed it
through her temporary adoption of him as her son, and had by force es-
tablished the house of Aragon on the Neapolitan throne. Rene tried and
failed to recapture the kingdom; his legal right to it passed at his
death to Louis XI, King of France; and in 1482 Sixtus IV, at odds with
Naples,</p>
<p>invited Louis to come and conquer Naples, “which,” said the Pope, “be
- longs to him.” About this time Venice, hard pressed in war by a league
of Italian states, called in desperation to Louis to attack either
Naples or Milan, preferably both. Louis was busy unifying France; but
his son</p>
<p>Charles VIII inherited his claim to Naples, listened to the
Angevin-Nea- politan exiles at his court, noted that the crown of Naples
was joined to that of Sicily, which carried with it the crown of
Jerusalem; he conceived, or was sold, the grandiose idea of capturing
Naples and Sicily, getting</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 6ll</p>
<p>himself crowned King of Jerusalem, and then leading a crusade against
the Turks. In 1489 Innocent VIII, quarreling with Naples, offered the
King- dom to Charles if he would come and take it. Alexander VI (1494)
for- bade Charles, on pain of excommunication, to cross the Alps; but
Alex- ander’s enemy, Cardinal Giuliano d ella Rovere — who later, as
Julius II, would war to drive the French from Italy — came to Charles at
Lyons, and urged him to invade Italy and depose Alexander. Savonarola
added an- other invitation, hoping that Charles would depose Piero de’
Medici in Florence and Alexander in Rome; and many Florentines accepted
the friar’s lead. Finally, Lodovico of Milan, fearing attack from
Naples, of - fered Charles unimpeded passage through the territory of
Milan whenever Charles should undertake a campaign against Naples.</p>
<p>So encouraged by half of Italy, Charles prepared to invade. To
protect his flanks he ceded Artois and Franche-Comte to Maximilian of
Austria, and Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand of Spain, and paid a
large sum to Henry VII for renouncing English claims on Brittany. In
March, 1494, he assembled his army at Lyons: 18,000 cavalry, 22,000
infantry. A fleet was sent to keep Genoa safe for France; on September 8
it recaptured Rapallo from a Neapolitan force that had landed there; and
the unre- strained bloodiness of this first encounter shocked an Italy
accustomed to reasonable slaughter. In that month Charles and his army
crossed the Alps, and paused at Asti. Lodovico of Milan and Ercole of
Ferrara went there to meet him, and Lodovico lent him funds. Charles
disrupted the schedule by getting smallpox. Recovering, he led his
troops through the Milanese into Tuscany. The Florentine frontier
fortresses at Sarzana and Pietra- santa might have resisted him, but
Piero de’ Medici came in perso n to sur- render them, along with Pisa
and Livorno. On November 17 Charles and half his army paraded through
Florence; the populace admired the unprec- edented cavalcade, grumbled
at petty thefts by the soldiery, but noted with relief that they
refrained from rape. In December Charles moved on toward Rome.</p>
<p>We have already looked at the meeting of King and Pope from Alex-
ander’s point of view. Charles behaved with moderation: he asked only a
free passage through Latium for his army, the custody of the papal pris-
oner Djem (who might be used as a pretender and ally in a campaign
against the Turks), and Caesar Borgia’s company as a hostage. Alexander
agreed; the army marched south (January 25, 1495), Borgia soon escaped,
and Alexander was free to reform the lines of his diplomacy.</p>
<p>On February 22 Charles entered Naples in unresisted triumph,
beneath</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>a canopy of cloth of gold borne by four Neapolitan nobles, and
acclaimed by the cheers of the populace. He showed his appreciation by
reducing taxes and pardoning those who had opposed his coming; and at
the request of the barons who ruled the hinterland he recognized the
institution of slavery. Thinking himself secure, he relaxed to enjoy the
climate and scenery; he wrote enthusiastically to the duke of Bourbon
describing the gardens amid which he now lived, lacking only an Eve to
be paradise; he marveled at the architecture, sculpture, and painting in
the city, and planned to take a selection of Italian artists with him to
France; meanwhile he dispatched to France a shipment of stolen art.
Naples so charmed him that he forgot about Jerusalem and his
crusade.</p>
<p>While he dallied in Naples, and his army enjoyed the women of the</p>
<p>streets and the stews a nd caught or spread the “French disease,”
trouble was organizing behind him. The Neapolitan nobles, instead of
being re- warded for helping depose their king, were in many cases
deprived of their estates for the benefit of former Angevin possessors,
or to pay Charles’s debts to his servitors; all state offices were given
to Frenchmen, and nothing could be obtained from them except by bribes
offensively exceeding Nea- politan custom; the occupying army added
insult to injury by their open contempt of the Italian people; in a few
months the French had worn out their welcome, and earned a hatred that
waited in fierce patience for a chance to expel the invaders.</p>
<p>On March 31, 1495, the resilient Alexander, the repentant Lodovico,
the angry Ferdinand, the jealous Maximilian, the cautious Senate of
Venice joined in a league for the united defense of Italy. King Charles,
parading through Naples with a scepter in one hand and a ball —
presumably the globe — in the other, took a month to realize that the
new alliance was rais- ing an army against him. On May 2 1 he left
Naples in charge of his cousin the Count of Montpensier, and led half
his army northward. At Fornovo, on the River Taro in the territory of
Parma, his 10,000 troops found their passage blocked by an allied army
of 40,000 men led by Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua. There, on
July 5, 1495, came the first real test of French vs. Italian arms and
tactics. Gonzaga, though he himself fought bravely, mismanaged his
forces, so that only half of them took part; the Italians were not
mentally prepared to fight warriors who gave no quarter, and many of
them fled; the Chevalier de Bayard, a lad of twenty, offered his men an
inspiring example of reckless courage, and even the King fought
valiantly. The battle was indecisive; both sides claimed vic- tory; the
French lost their baggage train, but remained masters of the field;</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>and during the night they marched unimpeded to Asti, where Louis,
third Duke of Orleans, awaited them with reinforcements. In October
Charles, with damaged repute but a whole skin, was back in France.</p>
<p>The territorial results of the invasion were slight. Gonzalo, the
“Great Captain,” drove the French out of Naples and Calabria, and
restored the Aragonese dynasty in the person of Federigo III (1496). The
indirect</p>
<p>results of the invasion were endless. It proved the superiority of a
national army to mercenary troops. The Swiss mercenaries were a
temporary ex- ception; armed with pikes eighteen feet long, and formed
in solid bat- talions that presented a discouraging “hedgehog” to
advancing cavalry, they were destined to many victories; but soon, at
Marignano (1515), the invincibility of this revived Macedonian phalanx
would be ended by im- proved artillery. It was probably in this war that
cannon were first placed on carriages that allowed them to be readily
manipulated for direction and range; 2 these carriages were drawn by
horses, not (as hitherto in Italy) by oxen; and the French brought into
action, says Guicciardini, such a num- ber of “field pieces and
battering cannon as Italy had never seen before.” 4 The French knights,
descendants of Froissart’s heroes, fought magnifi - cently at Fomovo;
but the knights too would soon yield to cannon. In the Middle Ages the
arts of defense had outrun the means of attack, and had discouraged war;
now attack was gaining on defense, and war became bloodier. The wars of
Italy had heretofore hardly engaged the people, and had afflicted their
fields rather than their lives; now they were to see ail Italy ravaged
and incarnadined. The Swiss learned in this year of war how fertile were
the plains of Lombardy; they would hereafter invade them repeatedly. The
French learned that Italy was divided into frag- ments that awaited a
conqueror. Charles VIII lost himself in amours, and almost ceased to
think of Naples, but his cousin and heir was of sterner stuff. Louis XII
would try again.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ATTACK RENEWED: 1496-1505</li>
</ol>
<p>Maximilian, “King of the Romans”— i.e., of the Germans — provided an
interlude. He fretted at the thought that his great enemy, France,
should be strengthened, and outflank him, by capturing Italy; he had
heard how rich and fair and weak that land was, not yet a country but
only a penin- sula. He too had claims on Italy; technically the cities
of Lombardy were still imperial fiefs, and he, head of the Holy Roman
Empire, might legally give them to whomever he wished; indeed, had not
Lodovico bribed him.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>614</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>with florins and another Bianca, to confer upon him the duchy of
Milan? Moreover, many Italians invited him: both Lodovico and Venice
were ap- pealing to him (1496) to enter Italy and help them resist a
threatened repetition of the French assault. Maximilian came, with a
handful of troops; Venetian subtlety persuaded him to attack Livorno,
the final outlet of Florence on the Mediterranean, and so weaken a
Florence still allied with France and always c ompeting with Venice.
Maximilian’s campaign failed through inadequate co-ordination and
support, and he returned to Ger- many only slightly a wiser man
(December, 1496).</p>
<p>In 1498 the Duke of Orleans became Louis XII. As the grandson of</p>
<p>Valentina Visconti he had not forgotten the claims of his family to
Milan; and as a cousin of Charles VIII he inherited the claims of the
Anjous to Naples. On the day of his coronation he assumed, among others,
the titles of Duke of Milan, King of Naples and Sicily, and Emperor of
Jerusalem. To clear his path he renewed a treaty of peace with England,
and con- cluded another with Spain. By promising her Cremona and the
lands east of the Adda, he lured Venice into signing an alliance with
him “for the purpose of making war in common upon the Duke of Milan,
Lodovico Sforza, and against everyone save the Lord Pope of Rome, for
the purpose of restoring to the Most Christian King . . . the duchy of
Milan as his</p>
<p>rightful and olden patrimony.” 4 A month later (March, 149 9) he made
an agreement with the Swiss cantons to supply him with soldiers in
return or an annual subsidy of 20,000 florins. In May he brought
Alexander VI into the alliance by giving to Caesar Borgia a French bride
of royal blood, the duchy of Valentinois, and a pledge of aid in
reconquering the Papal States for the papacy. Lodovico felt helpless
against such a coalition; he fled to Austria; in three weeks his duchy
disappeared into the realms of Venice and France; on October 6, 1499,
Louis entered Milan in triumph, welcomed by nearly all Italy except
Naples.</p>
<p>Indeed, all Italy but Venice and Naples was now under French domina-
tion or influence. Mantua, Ferrara, and Bologna hastened to submit.
Flor- ence clung to her alliance with France as her only protection
against Caesar Borgia. Ferdinand of Spain, though so closely kin to the
Aragonese dynasty in Naples, entered into a secret compact at Granada
(November 11, 1500) with the representatives of Louis, for the joint
conquest of all Italy south of the Papal States. Alexander VI, needing
French aid in re- conquering these States, co-operated by issuing a bull
that deposed Federigo III of Naples and confirmed the partition of the
Kingdom be- tween France and Spain.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 6lJ</p>
<p>In July, 1501, a French army under the Scot Stuart d’Aubigny, Caesar
Borgia, and Lodovico’s traitorous favorite Francesco di San Severino</p>
<p>marched through Italy to Capua, took and plundered it, and advanced
upon Naples. Federigo, abandoned by all, yielded the city to the French
in return for a comfortable refuge and annuity in France. Meanwhile el
gran capitdn, Gonzalo de Cordoba, won Calabria and Apulia for Ferdinand
and Isabella; and Federigo’s son Ferrante, who surrendered Taranto after
being promised his liberty by Gonzalo, was sent as a prisoner to Spain
on Ferdinand’s demand. When the Spanish army came into contact with
the</p>

<li>. “If the Lord had not put discord between France and Spain,” said
the Pope to the Venetian ambassador, “where should we be?” 5</li>
</ol>
<p>Fo r a time the fortunes of the new war favored the French.
D’Aubigny’s forces overran almost all southern Italy, and Gonzalo shut
up his troops in the fortified town of Barletta. There a medieval
incident brightened a dismal war (February 13, 1503). Angered by the
comment of a French officer that the Italians were an effeminate and
dastardly people, the com- mander of an Italian regiment in the Spanish
army challenged thirteen Frenchmen to fight thirteen Italians. It was
agreed; the war was inter- rupted; and the hostile armies stood as
spectators while the twenty-six combatants fought until all thirteen
Frenchmen had been disabled by wounds and taken prisoner. Gonzalo, with
the Spanish chivalry that often rivaled Spanish cruelty, paid from his
own pocket the ransoms of the prisoners, and sent them back to their
army.®</p>
<p>The incident restored the morale of the Great Captain’s troops; they
is - sued from Barletta, defeated and dispersed the besiegers, and
defeated the French again at Cerignola. On May 16, 1503, Gonzalo entered
Naples unresisted, and was acclaimed by the populace, which can always
be relied upon to applaud the victor. Louis XII sent another army
against Gonzalo; he met it on the banks of the Garigliano, and routed it
(December 29,</p>
<ol start="1503" type="1">
<li>; in that rout Piero de’ Medici, fleeing with the French, was</li>
</ol>
<p>drowned. Gonzalo now laid siege to Gaeta, the last stronghold of the
French in southern Italy. He offered them generous terms, which they
soon accepted (January 1, 1504); and the fidelity with which he kept to
these terms after the French had been disarmed led them — struck by so
great a violation of precedents — to call him le gentil capitaine. 7 By
the treaty of Blois (1505) Louis saved a bit of face by assigning his
Neapolitan</p>
<p>6i6</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>rights to his relative Germaine de Foix, who was, however, to marry
the widowed Ferdinand and bring Naples to him as her dowry. The crowns
of Naples and Sicily were added to those already on Ferdinand’s
insatiable head; and thereafter, till 1707, the Kingdom of Naples
remained an ap- panage of Spain.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAI: 1508-16</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy was now half foreign: southern Italy was Spain’s; northwestern
Italy from Genoa through Milan to the outskirts of Cremona was in the
power of France; the minor principalities accepted French influence;
only Venice and the papacy were comparatively independent, and they were
intermittently at war for the cities of the Romagna. Venice longed for
additional mainland markets and resources to replace those lost to the
Turks or threatened by Atlantic routes to India; she took advantage of
Alexander’s death, and Caesar Borgia’s illness, to seize Faenza,
Ravenna, and Rimini; Julius II proposed to recapture them. In 1504 he
persuaded Louis and Maximilian to stop their unchristian quarreling and
join him in attacking Venice and dividing among them the Venetian
possessions on the mainland. 8 Maximilian’s spirit was willing, but his
treasury was weak, and nothing came of the plot. Julius kept on
trying.</p>
<p>On December 10, 1508, a grand conspiracy was hatched against Venice
at Cambrai. The Emperor Maximilian joined it because Venice had taken
from imperial control Goriza, Trieste, Pordenone, and Fiume, because
Venice ignored his imperial rights in Verona and Padua, and because
Venice had refused him and his little army free passage toward Rome for
the papal coronation upon which he had set his heart. Louis XII joined
the League because disputes had arisen between France and Venice as to
the division of northern Italy. Ferdinand of Spain joined it because
Venice insisted on retaining Brindisi, Otranto, and other Apulian ports
which for centuries had been part of the Kingdom of Naples, but had been
seized by Venice during Na ples’ troubles in 1495. Julius joined the
League</p>
<ol start="1509" type="1">
<li>because Venice not only refused to evacuate the Romagna, but made no
secret of her ambition to acquire Ferrara — an acknowledged papal fief.
The European powers now planned to absorb all the mainland hold- ings of
Venice: Spain would recover her cities on the Adriatic; the Pope would
regain the Romagna; Maximilian would get Padua, Vicenza,</li>
</ol>
<p>Treviso, Friuli, and Verona; Louis would receive Bergamo, Brescia,
Crema, Cremona, and the valley of the Adda River. Had the plan
succeeded, Italy</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 617</p>
<p>would have ceased to exist; France and Germany would have reached
down to the Po, Spain almost up to the Tiber; the Papal States would
have been hemmed in helplessly; and the Venetian bulwark against the
Turks would have been destroyed. In this crisis no Italian state offered
Venice aid; she had provoked almost all of them by her rapacity; indeed,
Ferrara, reasonably suspicious of her, joined the League. The noble
Gonzalo, rudely retired by Ferdinand, offered his services as general to
Venice; the Senate dared not accept, for its sole hope of survival lay
in detaching one ally after another from the League.</p>
<p>Venice deserved sympathy now only because she stood alone against
overwhelming power, and because her loyal rich and her conscripted poor
alike fought with incredible pertinacity to a Pyrrhic victory. The
Senate offered to restore Faenza and Rimini to the papacy, but the angry
Julius responded with a blast of excommunication, and sent his troops to
recap- ture the Romagna cities while the French advance compelled Venice
to concentrate her forces in Lombardy. At Agnadello the French defeated
the Venetians in one of the bloodiest battles of the Renaissance (May
14,</p>
<p>1509); six thousand men died there on that day. The desperate Signory
recalled its remaining troops to Venice, allowed the French to occupy
all Lombardy, evacuated Apulia and the Romagna, confessed to Verona,
Vicenza, and Padua that she could no longer defend them, and gave them
full freedom to surrender to the Emperor or resist him as they chose.
Maximilian came down with the largest army — some 36,000 men — yet seen
in those parts, and laid siege to Padua. The surrounding peasantry made
all the trouble they could for his men; the Paduans fought with a
bravery that attested the good government they had enjoyed under Venice.
Maxi- milian, impatient and always pinched for funds, left in disgust
for the Tirol; Julius suddenly ordered his troops to withdraw from the
siege; Padua and Vicenza voluntarily returned to Venetian control. Louis
XII, having obtained his share of the spoils, disbanded his army.</p>
<p>Julius had by this time realized that the full victory of the League
would be a defeat for the papacy, since it would leave the popes at the
mercy of northern powers among whom the Reformation was already
beginning to find voice. When Venice again offered him all that he could
ask, he, “vowing that he would ne’er consent, consented” (ijio). Ha ving
re-</p>
<p>claimed what he considered to be the just property of the Church, he
was free to turn the fury of his spirit against the French who,
controlling both Lombardy and Tuscany, were now unpleasant neighbors of
the Papal States. At Mirandola he vowed never to shave till he had
driven the</p>
<p>6 1 8</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>French from Italy; so grew the majestic beard of Raphael’s portrait.
Now the Pope gave to Italy, too late, a stirring motto, Fuori i bar bari
! — “Out with the barbarians!” In October, 1511, he formed a “League of
Holy Union” with Venice and Spain; soon he won to it Switzerland and Eng
- land. By the end of January, 1512, Venice had recaptured Brescia and
Bergamo with the joyful co-operation of the inhabitants. France kept
most of her troops at home to meet possible invasion from England and
Spain.</p>
<p>One French force remained in Italy, under the command of a dashing
and courtly youth of twenty-two years. Resenting inaction, Gaston de
Foix led this army first to the relief of besieged Bologna, then to
defeat the Venetians at Isola della Scala, then to retake Brescia,
finally to win a brilliant but costly victory at Ravenna (April 11,
1512). Nearly 20,000 corpses fertilized that battlefield; and Gaston
himself, fighting in the front, received mortal wounds.</p>
<p>Julius repaired with negotiation what had been lost by arms. He per-
suaded Maximilian to sign a truce with Venice, to join the Union against
France, and to recall the 4000 German troops that had been part of the
French army. On his urging, the Swiss marched down into Lombardy with
20,000 men. The French forces, decimated by victory and the loss of
their German contingent, fell back before a converging mass of Swiss,
Venetian, and Spanish soldiery, and retreated to the Alps, leaving
ineffec- tual garrisons in Brescia, Cremona, Milan, and Genoa. Out of
apparently complete disaster the “Holy Union” had in two months after
the battle of Ravenna, through papal diplomacy, driven the French from
Italian soil; and Julius was hailed as the liberator of Italy.</p>
<p>At the Congress of Mantua (August, 1512) the victors divided the</p>
<p>spoils. On the insistence of Julius, Milan was given to
Massimiliano</p>
<p>Sforza, Lodovico’s son; Switzerland received Lugano and the territory
a t the head of Lago Maggiore; Florence was forced to restore the
Medici; the Pope regained all the Papal States won by the Borgias, and
besides acquired Parma, Piacenza, Modena, and Reggio; only Ferrara still
eluded the pontifical grasp. But Julius left many problems to his
successor. He had not really driven out the foreigners: the Swiss held
Milan as a guard for Sforza, the Emperor claimed Vicenza and Verona as
his reward, and Ferdinand the Catholic, wiliest bargainer of them all,
had consolidated the power of Spain in southern Italy. Only French power
seemed finished in Italy. Louis XII sent another army to take Milan, but
it was defeated by the Swiss at Novara with the loss of eight thousand
Frenchmen (June 6,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 619</p>
<p>1513). When Louis died (1515), nothing remained of his once extensive
Italian empire except a precarious foothold at Genoa.</p>
<p>But Francis I proposed to recapture it all. Moreover (Brantome
assures us), he had heard that Signora Clerice of Milan was the most
beautiful woman in Italy, and he desired her consumingly. 9 In August,
1515, he led over a new Alpine pass 40,000 men — the largest army yet
seen in these campaigns. The Swiss came out to meet it; at Marignano, a
few miles from Milan, a furious battle raged for two days (September
13-14, 1515); Francis himself fought like a Roland, and was knighted on
the spot by the Chevalier de Bayard; the Swiss left 13,000 dead on the
field; they and Sforza abandoned Milan, and the city became again a
French prize.</p>
<p>The councilors of Leo X, vacillating, asked Machiavelli’s advice.
He</p>
<p>warned against neutrality between King and Emperor, on the ground
that the papacy would be as helpless before the victor as if it had
taken part; and he recommended an entente with France as the lesser of
two evils. 10 Leo so ordered; and on December n, 1515, Francis and the
Pope met at Bologna to arrange terms of concord. The Swiss signed a
similar peace with France; the Spaniards retired to Naples; the Emperor,
foiled again, surrendered Verona to Venice. So ended (1516) the wars of
the League of Cambrai, in which the partners had changed as in a dance,
and the last condition of affairs was essentially as the first, and
nothing had been de- cided except that Italy was to be the battlefield
on which the great powers would fight duel after duel for the mastery of
Europe. The papacy</p>
<p>yielded Parma and Piacenza to France; Venice rewon her possessions in
northern Italy, but was financially exhausted. Italy was devastated; but
art and literature continued to flourish, whether by the stimulus of
tragic events, or by the impetus of a prosperous past. The worst was yet
to come.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>LEO AND EUROPE: 1513-21</li>
</ol>
<p>The conference at Bologna pitted prestige and diplomacy against au-
dacity and power. The handsome young King, magnificent in gold-</p>
<p>braided cloak and zibeline furs, came with victory in his plumes and
armies at his back, eager to swallow all Italy, merely keeping the Pope
as a police- man; against which Leo had nothing but the glamour of his
office and the subtlety of a Medici. If Leo thereafter played King
against Emperor, and veered from side to side elusively, and
simultaneously signed treaties with each against the other, we mnst not
be too righteous about it; he had no</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>other weapons to wield, and he had the heritage of the Church to
protect. His opponents also used those weapons, in addition to
brandishing regi- ments and artillery.</p>
<p>The secret agreements made at this meeting have remained secret to
this day. Apparently Francis tried to bring Leo into an alliance with
him against Spain; Leo asked for time to think it over — diplomacy’s way
of saying no; it was contrary to the age-long policy of the Church to
let the Papal States be hemmed in by one power on both north and south.
11 The one definite result of the Concordat of 1516 was the repeal of
the Prag- matic Sanction of Bourges. This Sanction (1438) had asserted
the superior authority of a general council over that of the popes, and
had given the French king the right to appoint to all major
ecclesiastical offices in France. Francis consented to annul the
Sanction, provided the royal power of nomination remained; Leo agreed.
It might seem a defeat for the Pope; but in so agreeing Leo was only
accepting a custom centuries old in France; and without so planning it
he was marrying Church and state in France in a way that left the French
monarchy no fiscal reasons for supporting the Reformation. Meanwhile he
ended the long conflict between France and the papacy over the relative
power of councils and popes.</p>
<p>The conference concluded by the French leaders begging forgiveness of
Leo for having warred against his predecessor. “Holy Father,” said</p>
<p>Franc is, “you must not be surprised that we were such enemies to
Julius II, since he was always the greatest enemy to us; insomuch that
in our times we have not met with a more formidable adversary. For he
was in fact a most excellent commander, and would have made a much
better general than a pope.” 12 Leo gave all these doughty penitents
absolution and bene - diction, and they ended by almost kissing his feet
away. 1 *</p>
<p>Francis returned to France under a halo of glory, and for a time con-
tented himself with Venus and mercury. When Ferdinand II died (1516) the
French King planned again the conquest of Naples, perhaps as a glori-
ous means of checking the excess population of France. Nevertheless he
signed a treaty of peace with Ferdinand’s grandson Cha rles I, the new
King of Aragon, Castile, Naples, and Sicily. But when Maximilian died
(1519), and his grandson Charles was put forward to succeed him as head
of the Holy Roman Empire, Francis thought himself fitter to be Emperor
than the nineteen-year-old King of Spain, and actively sought election.
Leo was again in a dangerous position. He would have preferred to sup-
port Francis, for he foresaw that the union of Naples, Spain, Germany,
Austria, and the Netherlands under one head would give that ruler
such</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>preponderance of territory, wealth, and men as would destroy the
balance of power that had hitherto protected the Papal States. And yet
the elec- tion of Charles over papal opposition would alienate the new
emperor precisely when his aid was vitally needed to suppress the
Protestant revolt. Leo hesitated too long to make his influence felt;
Charles I was chosen emperor, and became Charles V. Still playing
balance of power, the Pope offered Francis an alliance; when the King in
turn hesitated, Leo abruptly signed an agreement with Charles (May 8,
1521). The young Emperor offered him almost everything: the return of
Parma and Piacenza, aid against Ferrara and Luther, the reconquest of
Milan for the Sforza family, and the protection of the Papal States and
Florence from any attack.</p>
<p>In September, 1521, the duel was renewed. “My cousin Francis and I,”
said the Emperor, “are in perfect accord; he wants Milan, and so do I.”
14 The French forces in Italy were led by Odet de Foix, Vicomte de
Lautrec; Francis had appointed him at the solicitation of Lautrec’s
sister, who was for the moment the King’s mistress. Louise of Savoy, the
King’s mother, resented the appointment, and secretly diverted to other
uses the money provided for Lautrec’s army by Francis; 15 and the Swiss
in that army de - serted for lack of pay. As a strong papal-imperial
force — ably commanded by Prospero Colonna, the Marquis of Pescara, and
the historian Guic- ciardini — approached Milan, the Ghibelline
supporters of the Empire there</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>Adrian vi: 1522-3</li>
</ol>
<p>His successor was an anomaly in Renaissance Rome: a Pope who was
resolved at all costs to be a Christian. Born of lowly folk in
Utrecht</p>
<p>(1459), Adrian Dedel imbibed piety and scholarship from the Brothers
of the Common Life at Deventer, Scholastic philosophy and theology at
Louvain. At thirty-four he was chancellor of that University; at forty-
seven he was appointed tutor of the future Charles V. In 1515 he was
sent on a mission to Spain, and so impressed Ferdinand with his
administrative ability and moral integrity that he was made bishop of
Tortosa. After Ferdinand’s death Adrian helpe d Cardinal Ximenes to
govern Spain in the absence of Charles; in 1520 he became regent of
Castile. Through all this</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>progress he remained modest in everything but certainty, lived
simply, and pursued heretics with a zeal that endeared him to the
people. The repute of his virtues reached Rome, and Leo made him a
cardinal. In the con- clave that met after Leo’s death his name was put
forward as a candidate</p>
<p>How could the Romans, who had hardly heard of Adrian, forgive such an
affront? The pop ulace denounced the cardinals as madmen, as “be -
trayers of Christ’s blood”; pamphleteers demanded to know why the Vati -
can had been “surrendered to German fury.” 16 Aretino composed a mas -
terpiece of vituperation, termed the cardinals “filthy rabble,” and
prayed that they might be buried alive. 17 Pasquino’s statue was covered
with lampoons. The cardinals feared to show themselves in public; they
as- cribed the election to the Holy Ghost, who, they said, had so
inspired them. 18 Many cardinals left Rome, fearing both the contumely
of the people and the ax of ecclesiastical reform. For his part Adrian
calmly com- pleted his unfinished business in Spain, and notified the
Curia that he could not reach Rome before August. Unaware of the
splendor of the Vatican, he wrote to a Roman friend asking that a modest
house and garden be rented for his residence. When at last he reached
the city (which he had never seen before), his pale ascetic face and
lean frame awed observers into some reverence; but when he spoke, and it
appeared that he knew no Italian, and talked Latin with a guttural
accent all the world away from Italian melody and grace, Rome fumed and
despaired.</p>
<p>Adrian felt himself a prisoner in the Vatican, and pronounced it fit
for the successors of Constantine rather than of Peter. He discontinued
all further decoration of the Vatican chambers; the followers of
Raphael, who had been working there, were dismissed. He sent away all
but four of the hundred grooms that Leo had kept for his stable; he
reduced his personal servants to two — both Dutch — and bade them bring
his household expenses down to one ducat (2.50) a day. He was horrified
by the looseness of sex and tongue and pen in Rome, and agreed with
Lorenzo and Luther that the capital of Christianity was a sink of
iniquity. He</p>
<p>cared nothing for the ancient art that the cardinals showed him; he
de- nounced the statuary as relics of idolatry, and walled up the
Belvedere Palace, which contained Europe’s first collection of classi
cal sculpture. 19 He had a mind to wall up the humanists too, and the
poets, who seemed CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 623</p>
<p>to him to live and write like pagans who had banished Christ. When
Francesco Berni, in one of his bitterest capitoli, satirized him as a
Dutch barbarian incapable of understanding the refinements of Italian
art, litera- ture, and life, Adrian threatened to have the whole tribe
of satirists doused in the Tiber. 20</p>
<p>To lead the Church back from Leo to Christ became the devout passion
of Adrian’s pontificate. He set himself with blunt directness to reform
such ecclesiastical abuses as he could reach. He suppressed superfluous
offices with sometimes inconsiderate and indiscriminate vigor. He
canceled the contracts that Leo had signed to pay annuities to those who
had bought church offices; 2550 persons who had purchased these as an
investment lost, so to speak, both principal and interest; Rome
resounded with their cries that they had been defrauded; and one of the
victims tried to kill the Pope. Relatives who came to Adrian for
sinecures were told to go back and earn an honest living. He put an end
to simony and nepotism, scored the venality of the Curia, enacted severe
penalties for bribery or embezzle- ment, and punished guilty cardinals
with the same treatment as the hum- blest clerk. He bade bishops and
cardinals go back to their sees, and read them lessons on the morality
that he expected of them. The ill repute of Rome, he told them, was the
talk of Europe. He would not accuse the cardinals themselves of vice,
but he charged them with allowing vice to go unpunished in their
palaces. He asked them to put an end to their lux- uries, and to content
themselves with a maximum income of 6000 ducats (5,000) a year. All
ecclesiastical Rome, wrote the Venetian ambassador, “is beside itself
with terror, seeing what the Pope has done in the space of eight days.”
21</p>
<p>But the eight days were not enough, nor the brief thirteen months of
Adrian’s active pontificate. Vice hid its face for a while, but
survived; reforms irked a thousand officials, and met with a sullen
resistance and the hope for Adrian’s early death. The Pope mourned to
see how little one man could do to better men; “how much does a man’s
efficiency,” he often said, “depend upon the age in which his work is
cast!”— and he remarked wistfully to his old friend Heeze: “Dietrich,
how much better it went with us when we were living quietly in Louvain!”
22</p>
<p>Amid these domestic tribulations he faced as honorably as he could
the critical problems of foreign policy. He restored Urbino to
Francesco</p>
<p>Maria della Rovere, and left Alfonso undisturbed in Ferrara. Ousted
dic- tators took advantage of the pacific Pope and again seized power in
Pe- rugia, Rimini, and other Papal States. Adrian appealed to Charles
and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>624</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Francis to make peace, or at least accept a truce, and to join in
repelling the Turks, who were preparing to attack Rhodes. Instead,
Charles signed with Henry VIII of England the Treaty of Windsor (June
19, 1522),</p>
<p>which pledged them to make a concerted assault upon France. On De-
cember 21 the Turks took Rhodes, the last Christian stronghold in the
Eastern Mediterranean, and it was rumored that they were planning to
land in Apulia and conquer disorganized Italy. When Turkish spies were
captured in Rome the trepidation mounted to a point that recalled the
city’s fear of invasion after Hannibal’s victory at Cannae in 216 b.c.
To quite fill Adrian’s cu p of gall, Cardinal Francesco Soderini, his
chief min- ister and confidante, and a principal agent in his
negotiations for a Euro- pean peace, plotted with Francis a French
attack upon Sicily. When</p>
<p>Adrian discovered the plot, and learned that Francis was massing
troops on the border of Italy, he abandoned neutrality and leagued the
papacy with Charles V. Then, broken in body and spirit, he fell sick and
died (Septem- ber 14, 1523). His will left his property to the poor, and
his last instruc- tions were that he should be given a quiet and
inexpensive funeral.</p>
<p>Rome greeted his death with more joy than if the city had been saved
from capture by the Turks. Some believed that he had been poisoned for
art’s sake, and a wag attached to the door of the Pope’s physician an
inscription Liberatori patriae SPQR — expressing the gratitude of the
“Sen - ate and People of Rome to the Liberator of the Fatherland.” The
dead pontiff was blackened by a hundred satires; he was accused of
greed, drunkenness, and the grossest immorality, and every act of his
career was transformed into wickedness by malice and ridicule; now the
surviving freedom of the “press” in Rome prepared by its excesses its
own unmoumed demise. It was a pity that Adrian could not understand the
Renaissance; but it was a greater crime and folly that the Renaissance
could not tolerate a Christian pope.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>CLEMENT VII: THE FIRST PHASE</li>
</ol>
<p>The conclave that met on October 1, 1523, fought for seven weeks over
the selection of Adrian’s success or, and finally named a man who by
uni- versal opinion was the happiest possible choice. Giulio de’ Medici
was the illegitimate son of that amiable Giuliano who had fallen a
victim to the Pazzi conspiracy, and of a mistress, Fioretta, who soon
disappeared from history. Lorenzo took the boy into his family and had
him brought up</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 6 2 his sons. These included Leo,
who, as pope, dispensed Giulio from the canonical impediment of
bastardy, made him archbishop of Florence, then a cardinal, then the
able administrator of Rome and the chief minister of his pontificate.
Now forty-five, Clement was tall and handsome, rich and learned, well
mannered and of moral life, an admirer and patron of literature,
learning, music, and art. Rome greeted his elevation with joy as the
return of Leo’s gulden age. Bembo prophesied that Clement VII would be
the best and wisest ruler that the Church had ever known. 28</p>
<p>He began most graciously. He distributed among the cardinals all the
benefices that he had enjoyed, entailing a yearly revenue of 60,000
ducats. He won the hearts and dedications of scholars and scribes by
drawing them into his service or supporting them with gifts. He dealt
out justice justly, gave audience freely, bestowed charity with less
than Leonine, but with wiser, generosity, and charmed all by his
courtesy to every person and class. No pope ever began so well, or ended
so miserably.</p>
<p>The task of steering a safe course between Francis and Charles in a
war almost to the death, while the Turks were overrunning Hungary, and
one third of Europe was in full revolt against the Church, proved too
much for Clement’s abilities, as for Leo’s too. The magnificent portrait
of Clement in his early pontificate, by Sebastiano del Piombo, is
deceptive: he did not show in his actions the hard resolution that there
seems limned in his face; and even in that picture a certain weak
weariness shows in the tired eyelids drooping upon sullen eyes. Clement
made irresolution a policy. He carried thought to excess, and mistook it
as a substitute for action instead of its guide. He could find a hundred
reasons for a decision, and a hundred against it; it was as if Buridan’s
ass sat on the papal throne. Berni satirized hi m in bitter lines
prophetic of posterity’s judgment:</p>
<p>A papacy composed of compliment,</p>
<p>Debate, consideration, complaisance,</p>
<p>Of furthermore, then, but, yes, well, perchance,</p>
<p>Haply, and such like terms inconsequent. . . .</p>
<p>Of feet of lead, of tame neutrality. . . .</p>
<p>To speak plain truth, you shall live to see</p>
<p>Pope Adrian sainted through this papacy . 24</p>
<p>He took as his chief counselors Gianmatteo Giberti who favored
France, and Nikolaus von Schonberg who favored the Empire; he allowed
his mind to be torn in two between them; and when he decided for France
— only a</p>
<p>6l6 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>few weeks before the French disaster at Pavia — he brought down upon
his head and his city all the wiles and forces of Charles, and all the
fury of a half-Protestant army unleashed upon Rome.</p>
<p>It was Clement’s excuse that he feared the power of an Emperor
holding both Lombardy and Naples; and he hoped, by siding with Francis,
to se- cure a French veto on Charles’s troublesome idea of a general
counc il to adjudicate the affairs of the Church. When Francis came down
over the Alps with a new army of 26,000 French, Italians, Swiss, and
Germans, seized Milan, and besieged Pavia, Clement, while giving Charles
assurances of loyalty and friendship, secretly signed an alliance with
Francis (Decem- ber 12, 1524), brought Florence and Venice into it, and
reluctantly gave triumphant Francis permission to levy troops in the
Papal States and to send an army through papal territory against Naples.
Charles never for- gave the deception. “I shall go into Italy,” he
vowed, “and revenge myself on those who have injured me, especially on
that poltroon the Pope. Some day, perhaps, Martin Luther will become a
man of weight.” 25 At that moment some men thought that Luther would be
made pope; and several of the Emperor’s entourage advised him to contest
the election of Clement on the ground of illegitimate birth. 2 *</p>
<p>Charles sent a German army under Georg von Frundsberg and the</p>
<p>Marquis of Pescara to attack the French outside Pavia. Poor tactics
nulli- fied the French artillery, while the hand firearms of the Spanish
made a mockery of Swiss pikes; the French army was almost annihilated in
one of the most decisive battles of history (February 24-5, 1525).
Francis be- haved gallantly: while his troops retreated he plunged
forward into the enemy’s ranks, making royal slaughter; his horse was
killed under him, but he kept on fighting; at last, thoroughly
exhausted, he could resist no more, and was taken prisoner along with
several of his captains. From a tent among the victors he wrote to his
mother the message so often half-quoted: “All is lost save honor— and my
skin, which is safe.” Charles, who was at this time in Spain, ordered
him sent as a prisoner to a castle near Madrid.</p>
<p>Milan reverted to the Emperor. All Italy felt itself at his mercy,
and one Italian state after another presented him with diverse bribes
for permission to remain in existence. Clement, fearful of invasion by
the imperial army, and of revolution against the Medici in Florence,
abandoned his French alliance, and signed a treaty (April 1, 1525) with
Charles de Lannoy,</p>
<p>Viceroy of Naples for Charles, pledging Pope and Emperor to mutual
aid; the Emperor would protect the Medici in Florence and accept
Francesco Maria Sforza as imperial vicar in Milan; the Pope would pay
Charles, for</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 627</p>
<p>past affronts and future services, 100,000 ducats (,2 50, 000?), 27
which were badly needed for the imperial troops. Shortly afterward
Clement connived at a plot by Girolamo Morone to free Milan from the
Emperor. The Marquis of Pescara revealed it to Charles, and Morone was
jailed. Charles treated captive Francis with feline procrastination.
After soften- ing him with almost eleven months of courteous
imprisonment, he agreed to free him on the impossible conditions that
the King should surrender all French rights, actual or alleged, to
Genoa, Milan, Naples, Flanders, Artois, Toumai, Burgundy, and Navarre;
that Francis should supply Charles with ships and troops for an
expedition against Rome or the Turks; that Francis should marry
Charles’s sister Eleonora; and that the King should surrender his eldest
sons — Francis, ten, and Henry, nine years old — to Charles as hos-
tages for the fulfillment of these terms. By the treaty of Madrid (Janu-
ary 14, 1526) Francis agreed to all these conditions with solemn oaths
and mental reservations. On March 17 he was allowed to return to France,
leaving his sons in his place as prisoners. Arrived in France, he
announced that he had no intention of honoring promises made under
duress; Clement, with the support of canonical law, absolved him from
his oaths; and on May 22 Francis, Clement, Venice, Florence, and
Francesco Maria Sforza signed the League of Cognac, pledging them to
restore Asti and Genoa to France, to give Milan to Sforza as a French
fief, to return to each Italian state all its prewar possessions, to
ransom French prisoners for 2,000,000 crowns, and to bestow Naples upon
an Italian prince who would pay a yearly tribute of 75,000 ducats to the
king of France. The Emperor was cordially invited to sign this
agreement; if he refused, the new League pro- posed to war upon him
until he and all his forces were driven from Italy. 28</p>
<p>Charles denounced the League as violating Francis’ sacred oaths as
well as the treaty that Clement had signed with Lannoy. Unable to go to
Italy himself at this time, he commissioned Hugo de Moncada to win back
Clem- ent by diplomacy, and, that failing, to stir up against the Pope a
revolu- tion of the Colonna and the Roman populace. Moncada performed
his mission nicely: he brought Clement into an amicable agreement with
the Colonna, persuaded the Pope to disband the troops that were guarding
him, and allowed the Colonna to continue organizing a conspiracy to
capture Rome. While Christendom so exercised itself in treachery and
war, the Turks under Suleiman the Magnificent overwhelmed the Hungarians
at Mohacs (August 29, 1526), and captured Budapest (September 10). Clem-
ent, alarmed less Europe should become not merely Protestant but Mo-
hammedan, announced to the cardinals that he was thinking of going
to</p>
<p>6z8</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Barcelona in person to plead with Charles to make peace with Francis
and join forces against the Turks. Charles at that time was equipping a
fleet whose purpose, it was said in Rome, was to invade Italy and depose
the Pope . 29</p>
<p>On September 20 the Colonna entered Rome with five thousand men, and,
overriding feeble resistance, plundered the Vatican, St. Peter’s, and
the neighboring Borgo Vecchio, while Clement fled to Castel Sant’
Angelo. The papal palace was completely stripped, including Raphael’s
tapestries and the Pope’s tiara; sacred vessels, treasured relics, and
costly papal vest - ments were stolen; an hilarious soldier went about
in the white robe and red cap of the Pope, distributing papal
benedictions with mock solemnity . 30 On the following day Moncada
restored to Clement the papal tiara, as- sured him that the Emperor had
only the best intentions toward the papacy, and compelled the frightened
Pope to sign an armistice with the Empire for four months, and to pardon
the Colonna.</p>
<p>Moncada had hardly retired to Naples when Clement raised a new papal
force of seven thousand troops. At the end of October he ordered it to
march against the Colonna strongholds. At the same time he appealed to
Francis I and Henry VIII for aid; Francis sent dilatory excuses; Henry,
absorbed in the difficult task of begetting a son, sent nothing. Another
papal army, in the north, was kept inactive by the apparently
treacherous Fabianism of Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino,
who could not forget that Leo X had ousted him from his duchy, and was
not espe- cially grateful that Adrian and Clement had let him return and
stay. A braver leader was with that army — young Giovanni de’ Medici,
handsome son of Caterina Sforza, heir of her dauntless spirit, and
called Giovanni delle Bande Nere because he and his troops had worn
black bands of mourning when Leo died . 31 Giovanni was all for action
against Milan, but Francesco Maria overruled him.</p>

<p>Charles, still remaining in Spain, and moving his pawns with magic
re- mote control, commissioned his agents to raise a new army. They ap-
proached the Tirolese condottiere, Georg von Frundsberg, already famous
for the exploits of the Landsknechte — German mercenaries — who fought
under his lead. Charles could offer little money, but his agents
promised rich plunder in Italy. Frundsberg was still nominally a
Catholic, but he strongly sympathized with Luther, and hated Clement as
a traitor to the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 629</p>
<p>Empire. He pawned his castle, his other possessions, even the
adornments of his wife; with the 38,000 gulden so obtained he collected
some 10,000 men eager for adventure and pillage and not averse to
breaking a lance over a papal head; some of them, it was said, carried a
noose to hang the Pope. 82 In November, 1526, this impromptu army
crossed the mountains and de- scended toward Brescia. Alfonso of Ferrara
repaid the papacy for its many efforts to depose him, by sending
Frundsberg four of his mightiest cannon. Near Brescia Giovanni delle
Bande Nere was shot in a skirmish with the invaders; he died at Mantua
on November 30, aged twenty-eight. No one remained to hinder the Duke of
Urbino from doing nothing.</p>
<p>Frundsberg’s rabble grossed the Po as Giovanni died, and ravaged the
fertile fields of Lombardy so effectively that three years later English
am- bassadors described that terrain as “the most pitiable country that
ever was in Christendom.” 33 In Milan the imperial commander was now
Charles, Duke of Bourbon; created constable of France for bravery at
Marignano, he had turned against Francis when the King’s mother, as he
felt, had cheated him of his proper lands; he went over to the Emperor,
shared in defeating Francis at Pavia, and was made Duke of Milan. Now,
to raise and pay another army for Charles, he taxed the Milanese
literally to death. He wrote to the Emperor that he had drained the city
of its blood. His sol- diers, quartered upon the inhabitants, so abused
them with theft, brutality, and rape that many Milanese hanged
themselves, or threw themselves from high places into the streets. 34
Early in February, 1527, Bourbon led his army out of Milan, and united
it with Frundsberg’s near Piacenza. The conglomerate horde, now
numbering nearly 22,000 men, moved east along the Via Emilia, avoiding
the fortified cities, but pillaging as it went, and leaving the
countryside empty behind it.</p>
<p>When it became clear to Clement that he had no sufficient forces with
which to stop these invaders, he appealed to Lannoy to arrange a truce.
The Viceroy came up from Naples, and drew up terms for a truce of eight
months: Clement and the Colonna ceased their war and exchanged their
conquests, and the Pope provided 60,000 ducats with which to bribe
Frundsberg’s army to stay out of the Papal States. Then, nearing the end
of his funds, and supposing that Frundsberg and Bourbon would honor an
agreement signed by the imperial Viceroy, Clement reduced his Roman army
to three hundred men. But Bou rbon’s brigands shrieked with fury when
they heard the terms of the truce. For four months they had en- dured a
thousand hardships only in the hope of plundering Rome; most of them
were now in rags, many were shoeless, all were hungry, none was</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>paid; they refused to be bought off with a miserable 60,000 ducats,
of which they knew only a small part would trickle down to them. Fearing
that Bourbon would sign the truce, they besieged his tent, crying, “Pay!
pay !” He hid himself elsewhere, and they plundered his tent. Frundsberg
tried to calm them, but was stricken with apoplexy in the course of his
appeal; he played no further part in the campaign, and died a year
later. Bourbon took command, but only by agreeing to march on Rome. On
March 29 he sent messages to Lannoy and Clement that he could not hold
back his men, and that the truce was perforce at an end.</p>
<p>Now at last Rome realized that it was the intended and helpless prey.
On Holy Thursday (April 8), when Clement was giving his blessing to a
crowd of 10,000 persons before St. Peter’s, a fanatic clad only in a
leather apron mounted the statue of St. Paul and shouted to the Pope:
“Thou bas - tard of Sodom! For thy sins Rome shall be destroyed. Repent
and turn thee! If thou wilt not believe me, in fourteen days thou shalt
see.” On Easter Eve this wild eremite — Bartolommeo Carosi, called
Brandano — went through the streets crying, “Rome, do penance! They
shall deal with thee as God dealt with Sodom an d Gomorrah.” 35</p>
<p>Bourbon, perhaps hoping to satisfy his men with the enlarged sum,
sent to Clement a demand for 240,000 ducats; Clement replied that he
could not possibly raise such a ransom. The horde marched to Florence;
but the Duke of Urbino, Guicciardini, and the Marquis of Saluzzo had
brought in enough troops to man its fortifications effectively; the
horde turned away baffled, and took the road to Rome. Clement, finding
no salvation in truce, rejoined the League of Cognac against Charles,
and implored the help of France. He appealed to the rich men of Rome to
contribute to a fund for defense; they responded gingerly, and suggested
that a better plan would be to sell red hats. Clement had not hitherto
sold appointments to the col- lege of ca rdinals, but when Bourbon’s
army reached Viterbo, only forty - two miles from Rome, he yielded, and
sold six nominations. Before the nominees could pay, the Pope could see,
from the windows of the Vatican, the hungry swarm advancing across the
Neronian Fields. He had now some 4000 soldiers to protect Rome from an
attacking host of 20,000 men.</p>
<p>On May 6 Bourbon’s multitude approached the walls under cover of fog.
They were repelled by a fusillade; Bourbon himself was hit, and died
almost instantly. But the assailants could not be deterred from repeated
attack; their alternatives frere to capture Rome or starve. They found a
weakly defended position; they broke through it, and poured into the
city. The Roman militia and the Swiss Guards fought bravely, but were
annihi-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 631</p>
<p>lated. Clement, most of the resident cardinals, and hundreds of
officials fled to Sant’ Angelo, whence Cellini and others tried to stop
the invasion with artillery fire. But the swarm entered from a confusing
variety of directions; some were hidden by the fog; others so mingled
with fugitives that the Castle cannon could not strike them without
killing the demor- alized populace. Soon the invaders had the city at
their mercy.</p>
<p>As they rushed on through the streets they killed indiscriminately
any man, woman, or child that crossed their path. Their bloodthirst
aroused, they entered the hospital and orphanage of Santo Spirito, and
slaughtered nearly all the patients. They marched into St. Peter’s and
slew the people who had sought sanctuary there. They pillaged every
church and monas- tery they could find, and turned some into stables;
hundreds of priests, monks, bishops, and archbishops were killed.
St. Peter’s and the Vatican o had not to purchase his safety.” 37</p>
<p>Of the victorious mob half were Germans, of whom most had been con-
vinced that the popes and cardinals were thieves, and that the wealth of
the Church in Rome was a theft from the nations, and a scandal to the
world. To reduce this scandal they seized all movable ecclesiastical
valuables, in- cluding sacred vessels and works of art, and carried them
off for melting or ransom or sale; relics, however, they left scattered
on the floor. One soldier dressed himsel f as a pope; others put on
cardinals’ hats and kissed his feet; a crowd at the Vatican proclaimed
Luther pope. The Lutherans among the invaders took especial delight in
robbing cardinals, exacting high ransoms from them as the price of their
lives, and teaching them new rituals. Some cardinals, says Guicciardini,
“were set upon scrubby beasts,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>6 32</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>riding with their faces backward, in the habits and ensigns of their
dignity, and were led about all Rome with the greatest derision and
contempt. Some, unable to raise all the ransom demanded, were so
tortured that they died there and then, or within a few days.” 38 One
cardinal was lowered into a grave and was told that he would be buried
alive unless ransom were brought within a stated time; it came at the
last moment. 89 Spanish and German cardinals, who thought themselves
safe from their own country- men, were treated like the rest. Nuns and
respectable women were vio- lated in situ , or were carried off to
promiscuous brutality in the various shelters of the horde. 40 Women
were assaulted before the eyes of their husbands or fathers. Many young
women, despondent after being raped, drowned themselves in the Tiber.
41</p>
<p>The destruction of books, archives, and art was immense.
Philibert,</p>
<p>Prince of Orange, who had succeeded to the quasi command of the
undis- ciplined horde, saved the Vatican Library by making it his
headquarters, but many monastic and private libraries went up in flames,
and many pre- cious manuscripts disappeared. The University of Rome was
ransacked, and its staff was scattered. The scholar Colocci saw his
house burned to the ground with his collections of manuscripts and art.
Baldus, a professor, saw his newly written commentary on Pliny used to
light a camp fire for the pillagers. The poet Marone lost his poems, but
was comparatively fortunate; the poet Paolo Bombasi was killed. The
scholar Cristoforo Marcello was tortured by having one fingernail after
another pulled out; the scholars Francesco Fortuno and Juan Valdes slew
themselves in de- spair. 42 The artists Perino del Vaga, Marcantonio
Raimondi, and many others were tortured and robbed of all that they had.
The school of</p>
<p>Raphael was finally dispersed.</p>
<p>The number of deaths cannot be calculated. Two thousand corpses</p>
<p>were thrown into the Tiber from the Vatican side of Rome; 9800 dead
were buried; there were unquestionably many more fatalities. A low esti-
mate places the thefts at over a million ducats, the ransoms at three
million; Clement judged the total loss at ten million (,ooo,ooo?).
43</p>
<p>The sack lasted eight days, while Clement looked on from the towers
of Sant’ Angelo. He cried out to God like tortured Job: Quare de vulva
eduxisti me? qui utinam consumptus essem, ne oculus videret — “Why didst
Thou take me out of the womb? Would that I had been consumed, that no
eye had seen me!” 44 He ceased to shave, and never shaved again. He
remained a prisoner in the Castle from May 6 to December 7, 1527, hoping
that rescue would come from the army of the Duke of Urbino, or from</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>&lt;533</p>
<p>Francis I, or Henry VIII. Charles, still in Spain, was glad to hear
that</p>
<p>Rome had been taken, but was shocked when he heard of the savagery of
the sack; he disclaimed responsibility for the excesses, but took full
advan- tage of the Pope’s helplessness. On June 6 his representatives,
possibly without his knowledge, compelled Clement to sign a humiliating
peace. The Pope agreed to pay over to them and the imperialist army
400,000 ducats; to surrender to Charles the cities of Piacenza, Parma,
and Modena, and the castles of Ostia, Civita Vecchia, Civita Castellana,
and Sant’ Angelo itself; he was to remain a prisoner there until the
first 150,000 ducats had been delivered, and was then to be removed to
Gaeta or Naples until Charles should determine what to do with him. All
those in Sant’ Angelo were al - lowed to depart except Clement and the
thirteen cardinals who had ac- companied him. Spanish and German
soldiers were put in charge of the Castle, and kept the Pope nearly
always confined in a narrow apartment. “They have not left him ten scudi
worth of property,” wrote Guicciardini on June 2 1 All the silver and
gold that he had salvaged in his flight was surrendered to his captors,
to make up 100,000 ducats of his ransom.</p>
<p>In the meantime Alfonso of Ferrara seized Reggio and Modena (to</p>
<p>which Ferrara had age-long rights), and Venice took Ravenna. Florence
expelled the Medici a third time, and proclaimed Jesus Christ king of
the new republic. The whole edifice of the papacy, material and
spiritual, seemed to be collapsing into a tragic ruin that awoke the
pity even of those who felt that some punishment was deserved by the
infidelities of Clement, the sins of the papacy, the greed and
corruption of the Curia, the luxury of the hierarchy, and the iniquity
of Rome. Sadoleto, peaceful in Carpentras, heard with horror of Rome’s
fall, and mourned the passing of those halcyon days when Bembo and
Castiglione and Isabella and a hundred scholars and poets and patrons
had made the wicked city the home and summit of the thought and art of
the age. And Erasmus wrote to Sadoleto: “Rome was not alone the shrine
of the Christian faith, the nurse of noble souls, and the abode of the
Muses, but the mother of nations. To how many was she not dearer and
sweeter and more precious than their own land! … In truth this is not
the ruin of one city, but of the whole world.” 48</p>

<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>mer, and joined with famine and the continued presence of the
ravaging horde to make Rome a city of horror, terror, and desolation.
Churches and streets were littered anew with corpses; many of these were
left to rot in the sun; the stench was so strong that the jailers and
prisoners fled from the castle parapets to their rooms; even there many
died of the infection, among them some servants of the Pope. The
impartial plague struck the invaders too; 2500 Germans in Rome died by
July 22, 1527; and malaria, syphilis, and malnutrition cut the horde in
half.</p>
<p>The opponents of Charles began seriously to think of rescuing the
Pope. Henry VIII, fearing that an imprisoned pontiff might not grant him
a di- vorce from Catherine of Aragon, sent Cardinal Wolsey to France to
confer with Francis on measures to liberate Clement. Early in August the
two kings offered Charles peace and 2,000,000 ducats on condition that
the Pope and the French princes should be freed, and that the Papal
States should be restored to the Church. Charles refused. By the treaty
of</p>
<p>Amiens (August 18) Henry and Francis pledged themselves to war
against Charles; soon Venice and Florence joined this new league. French
forces captured Genoa and Pavia, and sacked the latter city almost as
thoroughly as the imperialist army had sacked Rome. Mantua and Ferrara,
dreading the present French more than the distant Charles, now joined
the league. Nevertheless Lautrec, the French commander, unable to pay
his troops, dared not march upon Rome.</p>
<p>The Emperor, hoping to restore his grace in Catholic Christendom, and
to cool the ardor of the growing league, agreed to release the Pope, on
condition that Clement should give no aid to the league, should at once
pay the imperialist army in Rome 1 12,000 ducats, and should give
hostages for his good behavior. Clement raised the money by selling red
hats, and by granting the Emperor a tenth of ecclesiastical revenues in
the Kingdom of Naples. On December 7, after seven months of confinement,
Clement left Sant’ Angelo, and, disguised as a servant, made his way
humbly out of Rome to Orvieto, apparently a broken man.</p>
<p>At Orvieto he was lodged in a dilapidated palace whose roof had cavea
in, whose walls were bare and cracked, whose floors admitted a hundred
draughts. English ambassadors visiting him to get Henry a divorce found
him huddled in bed, his pale emaciated face half lost in a long and
unkempt beard. He spent the winter there, and then moved to Viterbo. On
Feb- ruary 17 the imperialist horde, having received from Clement all
that he could pay, and fearing further decimation by disease, evacuated
Rome and moved south to Naples. Lautrec now brought his army down with
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 635</p>
<p>hope of besieging Naples; but his own troops were thinned out by
malaria, he himself died, and his disordered forces retreated to the
north (August 29,</p>
<p>1528). Losing all hope of aid from the league, Clement offered his
full surrender to Charles; and on October 6 he was allowed to re-enter
Rome. Four fifths of the houses had been abandoned, thousands of
buildings were in ruins; men were amazed to see what nine months of
invasion had done to the capital of Christendom.</p>
<p>Charles seems to have thought for a while of deposing Clement,
annexing the Papal States to the Kingdom of Naples, making Rome the seat
of his empire, and reducing the pope to his primeval role as bishop of
Rome and subject to the emperor. 47 But this would drive Charles into
the arms of the Lutherans in Germany, would court civil war in Spain,
and would arouse France, England, Poland, and Hungary to resist him with
their full and united power. He abandoned the scheme, and turned to the
idea of making the papacy his dependent ally and spiritual aid in
dividing Italy between them. By the treaty of Barcelona (June 29, 1529)
he made substantial concessions to the Pope: the principalities taken
from the Church were to be restored; the Medici relatives of the Pope
were to be re-established in Florence by diplomacy or force; even
Ferrara was now promised to the Pope. In return the Pope agreed to give
Charles the formal investiture of Naples, to allow the imperial armies
free passage through the Papal States, and to meet the Emperor at
Bologna in the following year to settle between them the peace and
organization of Italy.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter Margaret, aunt of Charles and Regent of the</p>
<p>Netherlands, met with Louise of Savoy, mother of Francis, and, with
the aid of various ambassadors and legates, formulated the treaty of
Cambrai (August 3, 1529) between Emperor and King. Charles released the
French princes for a ransom of 1,200,000 ducats; Francis renounced for
France all claims to Italy, Flanders, Artois, Arras, and Tournai. 48 The
allies of France in Italy were left to the mercy of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Charles and Clement met at Bologna on November 5, 1529, each now
convinced that he needed the other. Strange to say, this was Charles’s
first visit to Italy; he had conquered it before seeing it. When he
knelt before the Pope at Bologna, and kissed the foot of the man whom he
had dragged in the dust, it was the first time that these two figures —
the one representing the Church in decline, the other the rising and
here victorious modern state — had ever seen each other. Clement
swallowed all pride, forgave all offenses; he had to. He could no longer
look to France; Charles had ir- resistible armies in both southern and
northern Italy; Florence could not be</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>636</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>recovered for the Medici without imperial troops; the aid of the
Empire was needed against Luther in Germany, against Suleiman in the
East. Charles was generous and prudent: he kept essentially to the terms
of the Barcelona agreement made when he was not so unchallengeably
strong. He forced Venice to restore all that she had taken from the
Papal States. He allowed Francesco Maria Sforza, on paying a large
indemnity, to keep ruined Milan under imperial watching; and he
persuaded Clement to allow the cowardly or faithless Francesco Maria
della Rovere to keep Urbino. He forgave Al- fonso his recent association
with France, and rewarded him for aiding the march on Rome by letting
him retain his duchy as a papal fief, and giving him Modena and Reggio
as imperial fiefs; in return Alfonso paid the Pope 100,000 badly needed
ducats. To consolidate these settlements Charles sum- moned all the
principalities to join in a union of Italy for common defense against
foreign attack — except by Charles; that unity for which Dante had pled
to the Emperor Henry VII, and Petrarch to the Emperor Charles IV, was
now achieved through united subjection to a foreign power. Clement
blessed it all, and crowned Charles Emperor with the iron crown of Lom-
bardy and the imperial-papal crown of the Holy Roman Empire (Febru- ary
22-24, i53 0 )-</p>
<p>The alliance of Pope and Emperor was sealed with Florentine blood.
Resolved to restore his family to power, Clement paid 70,000 ducats to
Philibert, Prince of Orange (who had kept him prisoner), to organize an
army and overturn the republic of rich men that had been set up there
in</p>
<ol start="1527" type="1">
<li>Philibert sent on this mission 20,000 German and Spanish troops,
many of whom had shared in the sack of Rome. 49 In December, 1529, this
force occupied Pistoia and Prato, and laid siege to Florence. To expose
the assailants to Florentine artillery the resolute burghers destroyed
every house, garden, and wall for a mile around the city fortifications;
and Mi- chelangelo left his sculpture of the Medici tombs to build or
rebuild the ramparts and forts. The siege continued mercilessly for
eight months; food became so scarce in Florence that cats and rats
brought some 2.50 apiece. 50 Churches surrendered their vessels,
citizens their plate, women their jewelry, to be transformed into money
for provisions or arms. Pa- triotic monks like Fra Benedetto da Foiano
kept up the spirit of the people with fiery sermons. A courageous
Florentine, Francesco Ferrucci, escaped from the city, organized a force
of three thousand men, and attacked the besiegers. He was defeated with
the loss of two thousand of his soldiers. He himself was captured and
brought before Fabrizio Maramaldi, a</li>

<p>held helpless before him while he repeatedly drove a poignard into
him un- til the hero died. 61 Meanwhile the general whom Florence had
hired to lead its defense, Malatesta Baglioni, entered into a
treacherous agreement with the besiegers; he let them into the city, and
turned his guns upon the Florentines. Starving and disorganized, the
republic surrendered (Au- gust 12, 1530).</p>
<p>Alessandro de’ Medici became Duke of Florence, and disg raced his
fam- ily by his rapacity and cruelty. Hundreds of those who had fought
for the Republic were tortured, exiled, or slain. Fra Benedetto was sent
to Clem- ent, who ordered him imprisoned in Sant’ Angelo; there, said an
uncertain report, the monk was starved to death. 52 The Signory was
disbanded; the Palazzo della Signoria now began to be called Palazzo
Vecchio; and the great eleven-ton bell, La Vacca — the Cow — that had
from the lovely tower called so many generations to parlamento, was
taken down and broken to pieces, “in order,” said a contemporary
diarist, “that we should no more hear the sweet sound of liberty.”

<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>CLEMENT VII AND THE ARTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pope’s treatment of Florence confirmed the degeneration of the
Medici; his efforts to restore Rome revealed a spark of the
administrative genius and esthetic appreciation that had made the family
great. Sebastiano del Piombo, who had portrayed him in maturity, painted
him now as an old man, somber, deep-eyed, white-bearded, giving
benediction; appar- ently suffering had chastened and in some measure
strengthened him. He took vigorous action to protect Italy from the
Turkish fleets that now commanded the Eastern Mediterranean; he
fortified Ancona, Ascoli, and Fano, and paid the costs by persuading the
consistory of June 21, 1532- over the opposition of the cardinals — to
impose a levy of fifty per cent upon the incomes of the Italian clergy,
including the cardinals. 54 Partly by selling ecclesiastical offices, he
raised funds to rebuild the property of the Church, to restore the
University of Rome, and to resume the patronage of scholar- ship and
art. He took measures to ensure a proper supply of grain despite the
raids of Barbary pirates upon shipping near Sicily. In a remarkably
short time Rome was functioning again as the capital of the Western
world.</p>
<p>The city was still rich in artists. Caradosso had come from Milan,
Cellini from Florence, to raise the art of the goldsmith to its
Renaissance zenith; they and many more were kept busy making gold roses
and swords of honor as papal gifts, vessels for the altars, silver
staffs for Church authori-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>638</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>ties and processions, seals for cardinals, tiaras and rings for the
popes. Valerio Belli of Vicenza made for Clement a magnificent casket of
rock crystal, engraved with scenes from the life of Christ. This, now
one of the most precious objects in the Pitti Palace, was presented to
Francis I at the marriage of his son to Catherine de’ Medici.</p>
<p>The decoration of the Vatican stanze had been resumed in 1526. The
greatest painting of Clement’s pontificate was done in the Hall of Con -
stantine: there Giulio Romano pictured The Apparition of the Cross and
The Battle of the Milvian Bridge; Francesco Penni painted The Baptism of
Constantine, and Raffaello del Colie portrayed Rome Presented to Pope
Sylvester by Constantine.</p>
<p>After Michelangelo — and now that Giulio Romano had migrated to</p>
<p>Mantua — the ablest painter in Rome was Sebastiano Luciano, who
acquired his sobriquet del Piombo when he was appointed keeper and
designer of the papal seals (1531). Bom in Venice (c. 1485), he had the
luck to be taught by Gian Bellini, Giorgione, and Cima. One of his
earliest and finest pictures — The Three Ages of Man — shows him as a
delectable youth be- tween two famous foreign composers then in Venice —
Jacob Obrecht and Philippe Verdelot. For the church of San Giovanni
Crisostomo he painted — or finished for Giorgione — a vivid
representation of that saint in the fever of composition; and about the
same time (1510) he copied Giorgione’s most voluptuous manner in a Venus
and Adonis whose generous women seem to belong to a golden age before
the birth of sin. Probably in Venice also Sebastiano painted his
renowned Portrait of a Lady, long ascribed to Raphael as La
Fomarina.</p>
<p>In 1 5 1 1 Agostino Chigi invited Sebastiano to come to Rome and help
adorn the Villa Chigi. There the young artist met Raphael, and for a
time imitated his style of pagan ornament; in return he taught Raphael
the Venetian secrets of warm coloring. Soon Sebastian became a devoted
friend of Michelangelo, imbibed the Titan’s muscular conception of man,
and an - nounced the aim of wedding Venetian color to Michelangelesque
design. He had a chance to do this when Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici asked
him for a picture. Sebastiano chose as his subject The Raising of
Lazarus, in de- liberate competition with the Transfiguration that
Raphael was painting at the time (1518). Critics did not unanimously
contradict his judgment that he had equaled Leo’s favorite.</p>
<p>He might have progressed further had he not been too readily content
with his excellence. A passion for leisure kept him this side of genius.
He was a jovial fellow who could not see why one should wear himself out
either for superfluous gold or for such a will- o’ -the-wisp as
posthumous</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 639</p>
<p>fame. After he had received his sinecure in the Vatican from his
patron made pope, he confined himself for the most part to portraits, in
which few painters have surpassed him.</p>
<p>Baldassare Peruzzi was more ambitious, and made his sonorous name
ring for a generation across the mountains of Italy. He was the son of a
weaver. (Artists are mostly of lowly stock: the middle classes seek
utility first, hop- ing to have time for beauty in their senility;
aristocrats, though they nourish art, prefer the art of life to the life
of art.) Born in Siena (1481), Baldas - sare learned painting under
Sodoma and Pinturicchio, and soon went off to Rome. Apparently it was he
who painted the ceiling of the Stanza d’Eli - odoro in the Vatican, and
Raphael thought the work good enough to leave much of it unchanged.
Meanwhile, like Bramante, he fell in love with the classic ruins,
measured the ground plans of the ancient temples and palaces, and
studied the diverse forms and arrangements of columns and capitals. He
became a specialist in the application of perspective to
architecture.</p>
<p>When Agostino Chigi decided to build the Villa Chigi, Peruzzi was in-
vited to design it (1508). The banker was pleased with the result — the
stately crowning of a Renaissance facade with classic moldings and cor-
nices; and finding that Peruzzi could also paint, he gave the young
artist freedom to decorate several rooms of the interior in competition
with Sebastiano del Piombo and Raphael. In the entrance hall and the
loggia Baldassare pictured Venus combing her hair, Leda and her swan,
Europa and her bull, Danae and her golden shower, Ganymede and his
eagle, and other scenes calculated to raise the tired moneylender from
the prose of his days to the poetry of his dreams. Peruzzi set off his
frescoes with borders painted in such tricks of perspective that Titian
thought them to be veritable reliefs in stone. 55 In the hall of the
upper floor Baldassare made illusory architecture with his brush:
cornices sustained by pictured cary- atids, friezes supported by
pictured pilasters, mimic windows opening upon pictured fields. Peruzzi
had fallen in love with architecture, and made painting its handmaid,
obeying all the builder’s rules, but spiritless. Let us make an
exception here for the Biblical scenes that he painted in a semi- dome
of Santa Maria della Pace (1517), where Raphael had painted sibyls three
years before. Baldassare’s frescoes stood the comparison well, for these
are his finest paintings, while Raphael’s there were not his best.</p>
<p>Leo X must have been impressed by Peruzzi’s versatility, for he
appointed him to su cceed Raphael as chief architect at St. Peter’s ( 1
520) , and engaged him to paint the scenery for Bibbiena’s comedy, La
Calandra (1521). All that remains of Peruzzi’s work on San Pietro is the
ground plan that he drew; Symonds pronounced it “by far th e most
beautiful and interesting of</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>640</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>those laid down for St. Peter’s.” 56 Leo’s death, and the accession
of a pope allergic to art, drove Peruzzi back to Siena, then to Bologna.
There he de- signed the lovely Palazzo Albergati, and made a model for
the never fin- ished fagade of San Petronio. He hurried back to Rome
when Clement VII reopened the paradise of the arts, and resumed his work
at St. Peter’s. He was still there when the imperial mob sacked Rome. He
suffered special tribulations, says Vasari, because “he was grave and
noble of aspect, and they thought him some great prelate in disguise.”
They held him for a lordly ransom; but when he proved his lowly status
by painting a masterly portrait, they contented themselves with taking
from him all but the shirt on his back, and let him go. He made his way
to Siena, and arrived there almost naked. The Sienese government, proud
to recapture its prodigal son, engaged him to design fortifications; and
the church of Fontegiusta commissioned him to paint a mural which was
acclaimed by generous crit- ics as his chef- d’oeuvre— a Sibyl
announcing to a frightened Augustus the coming birth of Christ.</p>
<p>But Peruzzi’s greatest success was the Palazzo Massimi delle Colonne,
which he designed on his return to Rome (1530). The Massimi claimed
descent, and derived their name, from Fabius Maximus, who had earned
immortality by idling; they took their surname from the columned porch
of their previous dwelling, which had been destroyed in the sack. It was
Peruzzi’s good fortune that the curved irregularity of the site forbade
the usual dreary rectangular plan. He chose an oval form, with a
Renaissance fagade and a Doric portico; and while keeping the exterior
simple, he gave the interior all the ornament and splendor of a Roman
palace of Imperial days, with Greek refinements of proportion and
decoration.</p>
<p>Despite his multiform ability Peruzzi died poor, not having had the
heart to haggle with popes, cardinals, and bankers for fees commensurate
with his skill. When Pope Paul III heard that he was dying he bethought
him- self that only Peruzzi and Michelangelo remained to raise
St. Peter’s from walls to dome. He sent tkye artist a hundred crowns
(250?). Baldassare thanked him, and died nevertheless, at the age of
fifty-four (1535). Vasari, after suggesting that a rival had poisoned
him, relates that “all the painters, sculptors, and architects in Rome
followed his body to the grave.”</p>
<p>X. MICHELANGELO AND CLEMENT VII: I52O-34</p>

own mis - fortunes he bore with kindly patience the moods and revolts of
Michel-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 641</p>
<p>angelo, plied him with commissions, and accorded him all the
privileges of genius. “When Buonarroti comes to see me,” he said, “I
always take a seat and bid him be seated, feeling sure that he will do
so without leave.” 57 Even before becoming pope he proposed (1519) what
proved to be the artist ’s culminating sculptural assignment: to add to
the church of San Lorenzo in Florence a “New Sacristy” as a mausoleum
for famous Medici, to de - sign their tombs, and to adorn these with
appropriate statuary. Confident in the Titan’s versatility, Clemen t
also asked him to draw up architectural plans for the Laurentian
Library, strong and spacious enough to safely house the literary
collections of the Medici family. The stately stairway and pillared
vestibule of this Biblioteca Laurenziana were completed (1526- 7) under
Angelo’s supervision; the remainder of the building was later put up by
Vasari and others from Buonarroti’s designs.</p>
<p>The Nuova Sagrestia was hardly an architectural masterpiece. It was
planned as a simple quadrangle, divided with pilasters and surmounted by
a modest dome; its prime function was to receive statuary in the
recesses left in the walls. This “Medici Chapel” was finished in 1524;
and in 1525 Angelo began work on the tombs. Clement wrote to him in the
latter year a gently impatient letter:</p>
<p>Thou knowest that popes have no long life; and we cannot yearn</p>
<p>more than we do to behold the chapel with the tombs of our kins-</p>
<p>men, or at any rate to hear that it is finished. And likewise as
regards the Library. Wherefore we recommend both to thy diligence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we will betake us (in accord with your words) to a</p>
<p>wholesome patience, praying God that He may put it into thy heart</p>
<p>to push the whole enterprise forward together. Fear not that either
commissions or rewards shall fail thee while we live. Farewell, with</p>
<p>God’s blessing and ours .—Giulio.™</p>
<p>There were to be six tombs: for Lorenzo the Magnificent, his
assassinated brother Giuliano, Leo X, Clement VII, the younger Giuliano
“too good to govern a state” (d. 1516), an d the younger Lorenzo, Duke
of Urbino (d.</p>
<p>1519). Only the tombs of the last two were completed, and even these
not quite. Nevertheless they are the apogee of Renaissance sculpture, as
the Sistine Chapel is the summit of Renaissance painting, and St. Pet
er’s dome is the architectural pinnacle of the Renaissance. The tombs
show the dead men in the prime of life, with no attempt to reproduce
their real forms or features: Giuliano in the garb of a Roman commander,
Lorenzo as il Penseroso, the thinker. When some incautious observer
remarked this lack</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>642</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>of realism, Michelangelo answered with words that revealed his
sublime confidence in his artistic immortality: “Who will care, a
thousand years - agus of Giuliano are two nude figures: at the right a
man allegedly sym- bolizing Day, at the left a woman supposedly
representing Night. Similar recumbent figures on the tomb of Lorenzo
have been named Twilight and Dawn. These interpretations are
hypothetical, perhaps fanciful; probably the sculptor’s aim was merely
to carve again his secret fetish, the human body, in all the splendor of
male strength and all the comely contours of the female form. As usual,
he succeeded better with the male; the un- finished figure of Twilight,
slowly surrendering an active and exhausting day to night, matches the
noblest gods of the Parthenon.</p>
<p>War intervened upon art. When Rome fell to the Landsknechte (1527),
Clement could no longer play patron, and Michelangelo’s papal pension of
fifty crowns (25) a month ceased. Meanwhile Florence enjoyed two years
of republican liberty. When Clement made up with Charles, and a
German-Spanish army was despatched to overthrow the republic and rein-
stall the Medici, Florence appointed Angelo (April 6, 1529) to a Commit-
tee of Nine — Nove di Milizia — for the defense of the city. The
Medicean artist became, by the hazard of circumstance, the anti-Medicean
engineer feverishly engaged in designing and building forts and
walls.</p>
<p>But as these works proceeded, Michelangelo became more and more
convinced that the city could not be successfully defended. What single
town, divided as Florence then was in heart and loyalties, could
withstand the artillery and excommunications of Empire and papacy
combined? On September 21, 1529, in a mood of panic, he fled from
Florence, hoping to escape to France and its amiable King. Finding his
way blocked by Ger- man-held terrain, he took temporary refuge in
Ferrara, then in Venice. Thence he sent a message to his friend Battista
della Palla, art agent of Francis I in Florence: Would he join Angelo in
flight to France? 80 Bat- tista refused to leave the post that had been
assigned to him in the defense of the city; instead he wrote to Angelo a
stirring appeal to return to his duty, warning him that otherwise the
government would confiscate his property, leaving his impecunious
relatives destitute. About November 20 the artist was back at his work
on the Florentine fortifications.</p>
<p>According to Vasari he found time, even in those excited months, to
con- tinue work secretly on the tombs of the Medici, and also to paint,
for Al- fonso of Ferrara, the least characteristic of his works, Leda
and the Swan. It was a strange product for a man so slightly sexual and
so generally puri-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE 643</p>
<p>tan; and perhaps it came from a temporarily disordered mind. It
showed the swan copulating with Leda. Alfonso was something of a lecher
be- tween wars, but apparently he had not chosen the subject. The
messenger whom he sent to secure the promised work expressed
disappointment when he saw it, saying, “This is a mere trifle,” and made
no effort to secure it for the Duke. Angelo gave the picture to his
servant Antonio Mini, who took it with him to France, where it passed
into the collection of the omnivorous Francis I. It remained at
Fontainebleau until the reign of Louis XIII, when a high official
ordered it destroyed because of its indecency. How far this order was
carried out, and what was the later history of this original, is un-
known. A copy remains in the vaults of the London National Gallery. 61
When Florence fell to the returning Medici, Battista della Palla and
other republican leaders were put to death. Michelangelo hid himself for
two months in the house of a friend, expecting at any moment a like
fate. But Clement thought him worth more alive than dead. The Pope wrote
to his ruling relatives in Florence bidding them seek out the artist,
treat him with courtesy, and offer him the renewal of his pension if he
would resume work on the tombs. Michael agreed. But again, as with the
mausoleum of Julius, the mind of pontiff and artist had conceived more
than the hand could execute, and the Pope could not live long enough to
see the enterprise through. When Clement died (1534) Michelangelo,
fearful that Ales- sandro de’ Medici would do him harm now that his
protector was gone, took the first opportunity to slip off to Rome.</p>
<p>A profound and somber sadness marks the tombs, and the solemn Ma-
donna de’ Medici that Angelo also carved for the Sacristy. Historians
fond of democracy (and exaggerating its scope in Florence) have
generally as- sumed that the recumbent figures symbolize a city mourning
its forced sur- render to tyranny. But this interpretation is probably
fanciful: after all, they had been designed while the Medici ruled
Florence reasonably well; they had been carved for a Medici Pope
unfailingly kind to Angelo, and by an artist indebted to Medici from his
youth; it is not clear that he in- tended to condemn the family whose
tombs he was preparing; and his representations of Giuliano and Lorenzo
have nothing derogatory about them. No, these figures express something
deeper than the love of liberty by the rich few to rule the poor
unhindered by a Medici house usually popular with the people. They
express rather Michelangelo’s weariness with life, the fatigue of a man
all nerves and titanic uncompassable dreams, who found himself buffeted
by a thousand tribulations, harassed in almost every enterprise by the
dull recalcitrance of matter, the obtuseness of</p>
<p>644 THE RENAISSANCE (chap. XXI</p>
<p>power, and the called-in loans of borrowed time. Angelo had enjoyed
but few of life’s delights: he had no friends on a par with his mind;
woman seemed to him only a smooth anatomy threatening peace; and even
his most majestic triumphs were the issue of exhausting toil and pain,
the unfinishable symphonies of melancholy meditation and inescapable
defeat.</p>
<p>But when Florence had fallen to her worst tyrants, and terror
ruled</p>
<p>where once Lorenzo had governed happily, the artist who had carved a
criticism of life, and no mere theory of government, in the marbles of
the Medici shrine, felt that those melancholy figures expressed, as
well, the glory gone of the city that had nursed the Renaissance. On the
unveiling of the statue of Night the poet Gianbattista Strozzi wrote a
quatrain of literary exposition:</p>
<p>The Night thous seest here, posed gracefully</p>
<p>In act of slumber, was by an angel wrought</p>
<p>Out of this stone. Sleeping, with life she’s fraught.</p>
<p>Wake her, incredulous wight; she’ll speak to thee.</p>
<p>Michelangelo pardoned the complimentary pun on his name, but rejected
the interpretation. He gave his own in four lines that are the most re-
vealing in his poetry:</p>
<p>Caro vie il sonno, e piu Vesser di sasso</p>
<p>Metitre che 7 danno e la vergogna dura.</p>
<p>Non veder, non sentir vik gran ventura;</p>
<p>Perd non mi destar; deh! parla basso. —</p>
<p>Dear is my sleep, but more to be mere stone,</p>
<p>So long as ruin and dishonor reign.</p>
<p>To see naught, to feel naught, is my great gain;</p>
<p>Then wake me not; speak in an undertone. 62</p>

<p>Clement did not die until he had made one more reversal of policy,
and had crowned his disasters by losing England for the Church (1531).
The spread of the Lutheran revolt in Germany had created for Charles V
dif- ficulties and dangers that might, he hoped, be eased by a general
council. He urged this upon the Pope, and was angered by repeated
excuses and delays. Irritated in turn by the Emperor’s award of Reggio
and Modena to Ferrara, Clement veered again toward France. He accepted a
proposal of</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL COLLAPSE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>645</p>
<p>Francis that Caterina de’ Medici should marry the King’s second son
Henry, and he signed secret articles binding himself to help Francis re-
cover Milan and Genoa (1531).“ At a second conference in Bologna</p>
<ol start="1532" type="1">
<li>between Pope and Emperor, Charles again proposed a general coun- cil
at which Catholics and Protestants might meet and find some formula of
reconciliation; he was again rebuffed. He suggested a marriage of
Catherine with Francesco Maria Sforza, imperial vicar in Milan; he found
that the proposal came too late; Catherine was already sold. On October
12, 1533, Clement met Francis at Marseille, and there married his niece
to Henry, Duke of Orleans. It was a prime defect of the Medici as popes
that they thought of themselves as a royal dynasty, and sometimes rated
the glory of their family above the fate of Italy or the Church. Clement
tried to persuade Francis to make peace with Charles; Francis refused,
and had the audacity to ask papal acquiescence to a temporary alliance
of France with the Protestants and the Turks against the Emperor. 64
Clement thought that this was going a bit too far.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Under these circumstances,” says Pastor, “it must be considered
fortu - nate for the Ch urch that the Pope’s days were numbered.” 65 He
had al - ready lived too long. At his accession Henry VIII was still
Defensor fidei, defender of the orthodox faith against Luther; and the
Protestant revolt had as yet proposed no vital doctrinal changes, but
only such ecclesiastical reforms as the Council of Trent would legislate
for the Church in the next generation. At Clement’s death (September 25,
1534) England, Denmark, Sweden, half of Germany, part of Switzerland had
definitely broken away from the Church, and Italy had submitted to a
Spanish domination fatal to the free thought and life that had for good
or evil marked the Renaissance. It was beyond doubt the most disastrous
pontificate in the history of the Church. Everyone had rejoiced at Cl
ement’s accession, everyone rejoiced at his death; and the rabble of
Rome repeatedly defiled his tomb. 66</p>
