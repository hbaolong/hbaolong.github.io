Manners</h4>
<p>I. EDUCATION</p>
<p>O NE of the many basic conflicts fought in eighteenth-century France
was the effort of the Church to retain — and the effort of the philos-
ophes and others to end — ecclesiastical control over education. The
contest</p>
<p>The great majority of the peasants could not read. In many rural com-
munities, even up to 1789, the municipal authorities “could hardly
write.” 1 Most parishes, however, had a petite ecole where the priest or
his appointee taught reading, writing, and catechism, chiefly to boys,
for a small fee paid by the parents per pupil. 2 Children whose parents
could not afford to pay were admitted gratis if they applied. Attendance
was legally required by the edicts of 1694 a °d 1724, but these were not
enforced. 3 Many peasant fathers kept their children from school, partly
through need of them on the farm, partly because they feared that
education would be a troublesome superfluity in those destined to till
the land. Education could not guarantee a rise in status, for class
barriers were almost insurmountable in the first half of the century. In
the villages and small towns those who had learned to read seldom read
anything other than what concerned their daily work. Everyone knew the
catechism, but only in the cities was there any knowl- edge of
literature, science, or history.</p>
<p>In the middle and upper classes most education was carried on at home
by governesses, then by tutors, finally by dancing masters; these last
were expected to teach to both sexes the difficult arts of sitting,
standing, walk- ing, talking, and gesturing, with courtesy and grace.
Some girls received private lessons in Latin; nearly all above the poor
learned to sing and to play the harpsichord. The higher education of
girls was carried on in convents, where they progressed in religion,
embroidery, music, dancing, and the proper conduct of a young woman and
a wife.</p>
<p>Secondary education for boys was almost wholly in the hands of
Jesuits, though the Oratorians and the Benedictines shared in the work.
Skeptics</p>

<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>like Voltaire and Helvetius were among the many distinguished
graduates of the Jesuit College of Louis-le-Grand, where Pere Charles
Poree, pro- fessor of “rhetoric” (i.e., language, literature, and
speech) left loving memo - ries among his students. The curriculum in
the Jesuit schools had hardly changed in two centuries. Though it
continued to emphasize religion and the formation of character, the
material was largely classical. The authors of ancient Rome were studied
in the original, and for five or six years the young scholars lived in
intimacy with pagan thought; no wonder their Christian faith suffered
some questioning. Furthermore, the Jesuits “spared no efforts to develop
the intelligence and zeal of their students.” 4 These were encouraged to
debate, to speak in public, and to act in plays; they were taught rules
for the arrangement and expression of ideas; part of the clarity of
French literature was a product of Jesuit colleges. Finally, the student
received rigorous courses in logic, metaphysics, and ethics, partly
through Aristotle, partly through the Scholastic philosophers; and here
again, though the conclusions were orthodox, the habit of reasoning re-
mained — became, indeed, the outstanding mark of this specifically “Age
of Rea son.” Flogging was also a part of the curriculum, even for
students of philosophy, and with no distinction of rank; the future
Marquis d’Argenson and the Due de Boufflers were flogged before their
classes for having shot peas at their reverend professors. 5</p>
<p>Already there were complaints that the curriculum paid little
attention to the advances of knowledge, that the instruction was too
theoretical, giving no preparation for practical life, and that the
insistent religious indoctrina- tion warped or closed the mind. In a
once famous Traite des etudes (1726-</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>Charles Rollin, rector of the University of Paris, defended the
classical curriculum and the stress on religion. The chief goal of
education, he held, is to make men better. G ood teachers “have little
regard for the sciences where these do not conduce to virtue; they set
no store by the deepest erudi- tion when it is not accompanied by
probity. They prefer an honest man to a man of learning.” 6 But, said
Rollin, it is diffic ult to form moral character without basing it on
religious belief. Hence “the aim of our labors, the end of all our
teaching, should be religion.” 7 The philosophies would soon call this
in question; the debate on the necessity of religion for morality would
continue throughout the eighteenth century, and through the next. It is
alive today.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MORALS</li>
</ol>
<p>Rollin’s argument seemed to be borne out by the class differences in
mo - rality. The peasants, who clung to their religion, lived a
relatively moral life; this, however, may have been due to the fact that
the family was the</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>unit of agricultural production, the father was also the employer,
and fam- ily discipline was rooted in an economic discipline enforced by
the sequence of the seasons and the demands of the soil. In the middle
classes too religion actively survived, and supported parental authority
as the basis of social order. The conception of the nation as an
association of families through generations of time gave the strength of
solidarity and tradition to middle- class morality. The bourgeois wife
was a model of industry, piety, and motherhood. She took childbearing in
her stride, and was soon at her work again. She was content with her
home and her neighborly associations, and rarely touched that gilded
world in which fidelity was smiled at as passe; we seldom hear of
adultery in the middle-class wife. Father and mother alike set an
example of steady habits, religious observance, and mutual affection.
This was the life that Chardin lovingly commemorated in such pictures as
Le Benedicite.</p>
<p>All classes practiced charity and hospitality. The Church collected
and distributed alms. The antireligious philosophes preached
bienfaisance, which they based on love of humanity rather than of God;
modern humanitarian- ism was the child of both religion and philosophy.
Monasteries handed out food to the hungry, and nuns tended the sick;
hospitals, almshouses, orphan- ages, and homes of refuge were maintained
by state, ecclesiastical, or guild funds. Some bishops were worldly
wastrels, but some, like the bishops of Auxerre, Mirepoix, Boulogne, and
Marseilles, gave their wealth and their lives to charity. State
officials were not mere place seekers and sinecure parasites; the
provosts of Paris distributed food, firewood, and money to the poor, and
at Reims a municipal councilor gave 500,000 livres to charity. Louis XV
had strains of sympathy and timid tenderness. When 600,000 livres were
allotted for fireworks to celebrate the birth of the new Duke of
Burgundy (1751), he canceled the display and ordered the sum to be di-
vided as dowries for the six hundred poorest girls of Paris; and other
cities followed his example. The Queen lived frugally, and spent most of
her income on good works. The Due d’Orleans, son of the riotous Regent,
gave most of his fortune to charity. The seamier side of the story
appears in the corruption and negligence that marred the management of
charitable institutions. There were several cases in which hospital
directors pocketed money sent them for the care of the sick or the
poor.</p>
<p>Social morality reflected the nature of man — selfish and generous,
brutal and kind, mingling etiquette and carnage on the battlefield. In
the lower and upper classes men and women gambled irresponsibly,
sometimes losing the fortunes of their families; and cheating was
frequent. 8 In France, as in England, the government profited from this
gambling propensity by estab- lishing a national lottery. The most
immoral feature of French life was the</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>heartless extravagance of the court aristocracy living on revenues
from peasant poverty. The bedsheets of the Duchesse de La Ferte, lavish
with lace, cost 40,000 crowns; the pearls of Mme. d’Egmont were worth
400, - ooo. 9 Dishonesty in office was normal. Offices continued to be
sold, and were used by the purchasers for illegal reimbursement. A large
part of the money collected in taxes never reached the treasury. Amid
this corruption patriotism flourished; the Frenchman never ceased to
love France, the Parisian could not long live outside Paris. And almost
every Frenchman was brave. At the siege of Mahon, to stop drunkenness
among his troops, the Marechal de Richelieu decreed: “Anyone among you
who in future is found drunk will not have the honor of taking part in
the assault”; drinking almost stopped. 10 Dueling persi sted despite all
prohibitions. “In France,” said Lord Chesterfield, “a man is dishonored
by not resenting an affront, and utterly ruined by resenting it.” 11</p>
<p>Homosexual acts were punishable with burning at the stake, but this
law was enforced only among the poor, as upon a muleherd in 1724. The
Abbe Desfontaines, who had taught in a Jesuit college for fifteen years,
was ar- rested on such a charge in 1725. He appealed to Voltaire for
help; Voltaire rose from a sickbed, rode to Fontainebleau, and persuaded
Fleury and Mme. de Prie to secure a pardon; 12 for the next twenty years
Desfontaines was one of Voltaire’s most active enemies. Some of the
King’s pages were deviates; one of them, La Tremouille, appears to have
made the sixteen- year-old ruler his Ganymede. 13</p>
<p>Prostitution was popular among the poor and the rich. In the towns
em- ployers paid their female help less than the cost of necessaries,
and allowed them to supplement their daily labor with nocturnal
solicitation. 14 A con- temporary scribe reckoned the prostitutes in
Paris at forty thousand; an- other estimate said sixty thousand. 15
Public opinion, except in the middle classes, was lenient to such women;
it knew that many nobles, clerics, and other pillars of society helped
to create the demand that generated this supply; and it had the decency
to condemn the poor vendor less than the affluent purchaser. The police
looked the other way except when some private or public complaint was
made against the filles; then a wholesale arrest would be made to clear
the skirts of the government; the women would be herded before some
judge, who would condemn them to jail or hospital; they would be shaved
and disciplined, and soon released, and their hair would grow again. If
they gave too much trouble, or offended a man of power, they could be
sent to Louisiana. Insolent courtesans displayed their carriages and
jewels on the Cours-la-Reine in Paris or on the prom- enade at
Longchamp. 16 If they secured membership, even as supernumer- aries, in
the Comcdie-Francaise or the Opera, they were usually immune to</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>arrest for selling their charms. Some of them rose to be artists’
models or the</p>
<p>Love marriages, without parental consent, were increasing in number
and in literature, and they were recognized as legal if sworn to before
a notary. But in the great majority of cases, even in the peasantry,
marriages were still arranged by the parents as a union of properties
and families rather than as a union of persons. The family, not the
individual, was the unit of society; hence the continuity of the family
and its property was held more important than the passing pleasures or
tender sentiments of precipi- tate youth. Moreover, said a peasant to
his daughter, “chance is less blind than love.” 17</p>
<p>The legal age of marriage was fourteen for boys, thirteen for girls,
but they might be legally betrothed from the age of seven, which
medieval philosophy had fixed as beginning the “age of reason.” The
hounds of de - sire were so hot in the chase that parents married off
their daughters as soon as practicable to avoid untimely deflowering; so
the Marquise de Sauve- boeuf was a widow at thirteen. Girls in the
middle and upper classes were kept in convents until their mates had
been chosen; then they were hurried from nunnery to matrimony, and had
to be well guarded on the way. In this immoral regime nearly all women
were virgins at marriage.</p>
<p>Since the French aristocracy disdained commerce and industry, and
feudal revenues seldom paid for court residence and display, the
nobility resigned itself to mating its land-rich, money-poor sons with
land-poor, money-rich daughters of the upper bourgeoisie. When the son
of the Duchesse de Chaulnes objected to marrying the richly dowered
daughter of the merchant Bonnier, the mother explained to him that “to
marry advantageously beneath oneself is merely taking dung to manure
one’s acres.” 18 Usually, in such unions, the titled son, while using
his wife’s livres, periodically reminded her of her lowly origin, and
soon took a mistress to certify his scorn. This too was remembered when
the middle classes aided the Revolution.</p>
<p>No social stigma, in the aristocracy, was attached to adultery; it
was ac- cepted as a pleasant substitute for the divorce that the
national religion for- bade. A husband serving in the army or the
provinces might take a mistress without giving his wife an acceptable
reason for complaint. He or she might be separated by attendance at
court or duties on the manor; again he might take a mistress. Since
marriage was contracted with no pretense that senti- ment could override
property, many noble couples lived much of their lives apart, mutually
licensing each other’s sins, provided these w ere gracefully veiled and,
in the woman’s case, confined to one man at a time. Montesquieu made his
Persian traveler report that in Paris “a husband who would wish</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>2 9 I</p>
<p>o have sole possession of his wife would be regarded as a disturber
of pub- lic happiness, and as a fool who should wish to enjoy the light
of the sun to the exclusion of other men.” 19 The Due de Lauzun, who for
ten years had not seen his wife, was asked what he would say if his wife
sent him word that she was pregnant; he answered like an
eighteenth-century gen- tleman: “I would write and tell her that I was
delighted that Heaven had blessed our union; be careful of your health;
I will call and pay my respects this evening.” 20 Jealousy was bad
form.</p>
<p>The champion adulterer and model of fashion in this age was Louis
Fran- gois Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, Due de Richelieu, grandnephew
of the austere Cardinal. A dozen titled ladies fell in turn into his
bed, drawn by his rank, his wealth, and his reputation. When his
ten-year-old son was re- buked for slow progress in Latin, he retorted,
“My father never knew Latin, and yet he had the fairest women in
France.” 21 This did not prevent the Duk e’s election to the French
Academy twenty -three years before his friend and creditor Voltaire, who
was two years his senior. Public opinion frowned, however, when he
served as procurer of concubines for the King. Mme. Geoffrin barred him
from her circle as an “epluchure [select assem - blage] des grands
vices.” 22 He lived to the age of ninety -two, escaping the Revolution
by one year.</p>
<p>Such being the relations of spouses, we can imagine the fate of their
chil- dren. In the nobility they were frankly treated as impediments.
They were dismissed at birth to wet nurses; they were brought up by
governesses and tutors; they only intermittently saw their parents.
Talleyrand said he had never slept under the same roof as his father and
mother. Parents thought it wise to maintain a respectful distance
between themselves and their prog- eny; intimacy was exceptional,
familiarity was unheard of. The son always addressed his father as
“monsieur”; the daughter kissed her mother’s hand. When the children
grew up they were sent off to the army, to the Church, or to a nunnery.
As in England, nearly all the property went to the eldest son.</p>
<p>This way of life continued in the court nobility till the accession
of Louis XVI in 1774. It revealed in another aspect the loss of
religious belief in the upper classes; the Christian conception of
marriage, like the medieval ideal of chivalry, was quite abandoned; the
pursuit of pleasure was more nakedly “pagan” than at any time since
Imperial and decadent Rome. Many works on morality were published in
eighteenth-century France, but books of deliberate indecency abounded,
and circulated widely, though clandes- tinely. “The French,” wrote
Frederick the Great, “and above all the inhab- itants of Paris, were now
sybarites enervated by pleasure and ease.” 23 The Marquis d’Argenson,
about 1749, saw in the decline of moral sensibility another omen of
national disaster:</p>
<p>2 9 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>The heart is a faculty of which we despoil ourselves every day by</p>
<p>giving it no exercise, while the mind is continually sharpened and
re- fined. We become more and more intellectual…. I predict that
this</p>
<p>realm will perish from the extinction of the faculties that derive
from the heart. We have no more friends; we no longer love our
mistresses; how shall we love our country?… Men lose daily some part of
that fine quality which we call sensibility. Love, and the need to love,
dis- appear…. Calculations of interest absorb us continually; everything
is a commerce of intrigue…. The interior fire goes out for lack of</p>
<p>nourishment; a paralysis creeps over the heart. 24</p>
<p>It is the voice of Pascal speaking for Port-Royal, the voice of
Rousseau a generation before Jean Jacques, the voice of sensitive
spirits in any age of intellectual ferment and liberation. We shall hear
it again.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Never was a reckless morality so gilded with refinement of manners,
elegance of dress and speech, variety of pleasures, the charm of women,
the flowery politeness of correspondence, the brilliance of intellect
and wit. “Never before had there been in France, nor was there in
contemporary - fected that art, the most useful and agreeable of any,
Fart de vivre, the art of society and conversation.” 26 It was toward
the end of this period that the word civilization came into use. It did
not appear in Johnson’s Dictionary in 1755, nor in the Grand Vocabulaire
published in thirty volumes in Paris in 1768.</p>
<p>The French felt especially civilized in their dress. Men quite
rivaled</p>
<p>women in the care they took with their clothes. In the upper classes
fashion required them to wear a large three-cornered hat, with feathers
and gold braid; but as this disturbed their wigs they usually wore it
under the arm. Wigs were smaller now than under the Great King, but they
were more general, even among artisans. There were twelve hundred wig
shops in Paris, with six thousand employees. Hair and wig were powdered.
Male hair was usually long, caught behind the neck by a ribbon or in a
bag. A long coat of fancy coloring and material — generally of velvet —
covered the inner’ costume, which showed a vest open at the throat, a
fluffy silk shirt, a wide cravat, and sleeves spreading into ornate
ruffles at the wrists. Knee breeches ( culottes ) were colored;
stockings were of white silk, shoes were buckled with silver clasps.
Courtiers, as a distinguishing mark, wore shoes with red</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>heels. Some of them used whalebones to keep their coattails in proper
spread; some wore diamonds in their buttonholes; all carried a sword,
and some a cane. The wearing of a sword was forbidden to servants,
appren- tices, and musicians. 27 The bourgeois dressed simply, in coat
and culottes of plain dark cloth, with stockings of black or gray wool,
and shoes with thick soles and low heels. Artisans and household help
took on the discarded garments of the rich; the elder Mirabeau grumbled
that he could not tell a blacksmith from a lord.</p>
<p>Women still enjoyed the freedom of their legs within the spacious
sanc- tum of their farthingales. The cler gy denounced as “she -
monkeys” and “clerks of the Devil” the women who wore such hoopskirts,
but the ladies loved them for the majesty they gave to their figures
even when enceintes. Mme. de Crequi tells us, “I could not whisper to
Mme. d’Egmont, because our hoops prevented our being near together.” 28
Milady’s high -heeled shoes — of colored leather set off with embroidery
of silver or gold — made her feet entrancing if unseen; her bootmakers
rose into the upper bourgeoisie by such artistry; romances were written
about a pretty foot, which was usually a pretty shoe. Almost as exciting
were the flowered heelless “mules” which Milady wore at home. Useful
also were the flounces, ribbons, fans, and pre- tintailles, or
ornamental “pretties,” that caught the male’s roving eye or dis - guised
the female’s roving form. Corsets of whalebone molded that form to
fashionable shape. Enough of the bosom was shown to certify a cozy
amplitude. Coiffures were low and simple; the tower hairdo waited
till</p>
<ol start="1763" type="1">
<li><p>Cosmetics doctored hands, arms, face, and hair; but men fell
little short of women in using perfume. Every ladylike face was painted
and powdered, and strategically patched with beauty-spot mouches (flies)
made of black silk and cut in the shape of hearts, teardrops, moons,

on the fore- head, on the temples, near the eyes, and at the corners of
the mouth; she carried a patch-box with additional mouches in case any
should fall off. A rich lady’s boudoir table shone with necessaires—
boxes of gold or silver or lapis lazuli designed to hold toiletries.

<p>294 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Meals were not as ornate as dress, but they required as subtle and
varied a science, as delicate an art. French cooking was already the
model and peril of Christendom. Voltaire warned his countrymen in 1749
that their heavy repasts would “eventually numb all the faculties of the
mind”; 29 he gave a good example of simple diet and nimble wits. The
higher the class, the more was eaten; so a typical dinner at the table
of Louis XV included soup, a roast of beef, a cut of veal, some chicken,
a partridge, a pigeon, fruit, and preserves. 30 “There are very few
peasants,” Voltaire tells us, “who eat meat</p>
<p>Coffee now rivaled wine as a drink. Michelet must have loved coffee,
for he thought that its mounting influx from Arabia, India, the island
of Bour- bon, and the Caribbean contributed to the exhilaration of
spirit that marked the Enlightenment. 33 Every apothecary sold coffee in
grain or in a drink at the counter. There were three hundred cafes in
Paris in 1715, six hundred in 1750, and a proportionate number in the
provincial towns. At the Cafe Procope — called also the Cave, because it
was always kept dark — Diderot spilled ideas and Voltaire came in
disguise to hear comments on his latest play. Such coffeehouses were the
salons of the commoners, where men might play chess or checkers or
dominoes, and, above all, talk; for men had grown lonelier as city
crowds had increased.</p>
<p>Clubs were private cafes, restricted in membership and tending to
specific interests. So the Abbe Alari established (c. 1721) the Club de
l’Entresol (a mezzanine in the abbe’s home) where some twenty statesmen,
magistrates, and men of letters gathered to discuss the problems of the
day, including religion and politics. Bolingbroke gave it its name, and
so brought the word club into the French language. There the Abbe de
Saint-Pierre expounded his plans for social reforms and perpetual peace;
some of these worried Cardinal Fleury, who ordered the disbandment of
the club in 1731. Three years later Jacobite refugees from England
founded in Paris the first French Freemasonry lodge. Montesquieu joined
it, and several members of the high nobility. It served as a refuge for
deists and as a center of political</p>

<p>intrigue; it became a channel of English influence, and prepared the
way for the philosophes.</p>
<p>Bored with the round of domestic toil, men and women flocked to the
promenades, dance halls, theaters, concerts, and opera; the rich took to
the hunt, the bourgeoisie to fetes champetres. The Bois de Boulogne, the
Champs-Elysees, the Jardins des Tuileries, the Luxembourg Gardens, and
the Jardin des Plantes — or “Jardin du Roi,” as it was then called— were
favorite resorts for carriage rides, walks, lovers’ haunts, and Easter
parades. If people stayed home they amused themselves with indoor games,
dances, chamber concerts, and private theatricals. Everyone danced.
Ballet had be- come a complex and royal art, in which the King himself
occasionally pranced a part. Ballet dancers like La Camargo and La
Gaussin were the toast of the town and the delicacies of
millionaires.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>Music in France had declined since Lully had outdone Moliere in amus-
ing the Great King. There was not here the same madness about music that
made Italy forget its political subjection, nor that laborious devotion
to compositional technique which was creating the massive Masses and
pro- longed Passions of Bach’s Germany. French music was in transition
from classic form to baroque decoration to rococo grace, from complex
counter- point mutilating words to fluent melodies and tender themes
congenial to French character. Popular composers still issued amorous,
satirical, or melancholy songs deifying lasses, defying kings,
deprecating virginity and delay. Patronage of music was spreading from
kings requiring majesty to financiers apologizing for their fortunes
with concerts, dramas, and poetry open to the influential few.
Rousseau’s opera Les Muses galantes was pro - duced in the home of the
farmer general La Popeliniere. Some rich men had orchestras of their
own. Performances open to the public for an admis- sion charge were
regularly offered in Paris by the Concerts Spirituels, or- ganized in
1725; and other cities followed suit. Opera was presented in the
Palais-Royal, usually in late afternoon, concluding by 8:30 p.m.; then
the audience, in evening dress, promenaded in the Tuileries Gardens, and
sing- ers and instrumentalists entertained them in the open air; this
was one of many charming features of Paris life.</p>
<p>We perceive in reading Diderot’s Le Neveu de Rameau how many com -
posers and executants were then the rage who are forgotten now. Only one
French composer in this period left behind him works that still cling to
life. Jean Philippe Rameau had every impulse to music. His father was
organist</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>in the Church of St.-£tienne at Dijon. Enthusiastic biographers
assure us that Jean at seven could read at sight any music placed before
him. At col- lege he so absorbed himself in music that the Jesuit
fathers expelled him; thereafter he hardly ever opened a book except of
or on music. Soon he was so proficient on organ, harpsichord, and violin
that Dijon had nothing more to teach him. When he strayed into love, his
father, thinking this a waste of talent, sent him to Italy to study its
secrets of melody (1701).</p>
<p>Back in France, Jean served as organist in Clermont-Ferrand,
succeeded his father in Dijon (1709-14), returned to Clermont as
organist of the cathedral (1716), and settled in Paris in 1721. There,
in 1722, aged thirty- nine, he wrote the outstanding work of musical
theory in eighteenth-century France — Traite de Vharmonie reduite a ses
principes naturels. Rameau argued that in a proper musical composition
there is always, whether scored or not, a “fundamental base” from which
all chords above it can be derived; that all chords can be deduced from
the harmonic series of partial tones; and that these chords may be
inverted without losing their identity. Rameau wrote in a style
intelligible only to the most obdurate musicians, but his ideas pleased
the mathematician d’Alembert, who gave them a more lucid exposition in
1752. Today the laws of chordal association formulated by Rameau are
accepted as the theoretical foundation of musical com- position. 34</p>
<p>Opposed by the critics, Rameau fought back with compositions and ex-
positions until he was finally revered for having reduced music to law
as Newton had reduced the stars. 33 In 1726, aged forty-three, he
married Marie Mangot, aged eighteen. In 1727 he pu t to music Voltaire’s
lyric drama Samson, but its production was forbidden on the ground that
Bibli- cal stories should not be reduced to opera. Rameau had to butter
his bread by serving as organist in the Church of
St.-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie. He was fifty before he conquered the
operatic stage.</p>
<p>In that year (1733) Abbe Pellegrin offered him a libretto, Hippolyte
et Aricie, founded on Racine’s Phedre, but he exacted from Rameau a bill
for five hundred livres as security in case the opera should fail. When
it was rehearsed the abbe was so delighted with the music that he tore
up the bill at the end of the first act. The public performance at the
Academie de Musique surprised the audience with bold departures from the
modes that had become a s acred tradition since Lully. Critics protested
Rameau’s novel rhythms, heretical modulations, and orchestral
elaborations; even the or- chestra resented the music. For a time Rameau
thought of abandoning all attempts at opera, but his next effort, Les
Indes galantes (1735), won the audience by its flow of melody, and his
Castor et Pollux (1737) was one of the great triumphs in French operatic
history.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>2 97</p>
<p>Success spoiled him. He boasted that he could turn any libretto into
a good opera, and that he could set a newspaper to music. 36 He produced
a long succession of indifferent operas. When the managers of the
Academie de Musique tired of him, he composed pieces for the
harpsichord, violin, or flute. Louis XV — or Mme. de Pompadour — came to
his aid by engaging him to write the music for Voltaire’s La Trine esse
de Navarre, which had a re - assuring success at Versailles (1745). He
was restored to favor at the Academie, and wrote more operas. As Paris
became familiar with his style it forgot Lully, and acclaimed Rameau as
the unrivaled monarch of the musical world.</p>
<p>Then in 1752 he found himself faced with a new challenge. Virtuosos
and composers had come in from Italy, and a noisy war began between
French and Italian music, which would culminate in the seventies with
Piccini versus Gluck. An Italian troupe presented at the Paris Opera, as
an intermezzo, Pergolesi’s La serva padrona, one of the classics of
comic opera.</p>
<p>I believe I have made it evident that there is neither measure nor
mel- ody in French music, because the language does not allow them; that
French singing is only a continued barking and complaining, unbear- able
to any unprepossessed ear; that its harmony is rough [brute],</p>
<p>without expression, and feeling only what it has learned from its</p>
<p>eacher; that French arias are not arias, that French recitative is
no</p>
<p>recitative. Whence I concluded that the French have no music, and</p>
<p>cannot have any, or that if ever they have any, it will be so much
the worse for them.</p>
<p>The partisans of French music retaliated with twenty-five pamphlets,
and burned Rousseau in effigy at the Opera door. 37 Rameau was
unwillingly used as the piece de resistance in this Guerre des Bouffons,
or War of Buf- foons. When it subsided, and he was pronounced victor, he
acknowledged that French music had still much to learn from the Italian;
and were he not so old, he said, he would go back to Italy to study the
methods of Pergolesi and other Italian masters.</p>
<p>He was now at the height of his popularity, but he had many enemies,
old and new. He added to them with a pamphlet exposing the errors in the
articles on music in the Encyclopedic. Rousseau, who had written most
of</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>he articles, turned upon him with hatred; and Diderot, father of the
En- cyclopedic, abused the old composer with respectful discrimination
in he Neveu de Rameau, which Diderot had the grace not to publish:</p>
<p>The famous musician who delivered us from the plainsong of Lully</p>
<p>hat we had intoned for over a century, and who wrote so much vision-
ary gibberish and apocalyptic truth about the theory of music — writ-
ings which neither he nor anyone else ever understood. We have from him
a number of operas in which one finds harmony, snatches of song,
disconnected ideas, clatter, flights, triumphal processions, spears,</p>
<p>apotheoses,… and dance tunes that will last for all time. 38</p>
<p>When, in 1760, aged seventy-seven, Rameau appeared in a box at the
revival of his opera Dardanus, he received an ovation that almost
rivaled that which would be given to Voltaire eighteen years later. The
King gave him a patent of nobility, and Dijon, proud of its son,
exempted him and his family from municipal taxes to the end of time. At
the height of his glory he caught typhoid fever, wasted away quickly,
and died, September 12, 1764. Paris accorded him a ceremonial interment
in the Church of St.-Eustache, and many towns in France held services in
his honor.</p>
<p>V. THE SALONS</p>
<p>Paris was the cultural capital of the world rather than of France.
“Those who live a hundred leagues from the capital,” said Duclos, “are a
hundred years away from it in ways of conduct and thought.” 39 Probably
never in history had a city so hummed with varied life. Polite society
and advanced literature were bound in an intoxicating intimacy. The fear
of hell had gone from the educated Parisians, and had left them
unprecedentedly gay, care- less in their new confidence that there was
no omnipotent ogre in the skies eavesdropping on their sins. From that
emancipation of the mind no somber aftermath had yet come of a world
shorn of divinity and moral goal and shivering in the chill of
insignificance. Conversation was brilliant, wit frol - icked and
crackled, and often lapsed into superficial badinage; thought then
stayed on the surface of things, as if in fear of finding nothing
beneath; and scandal gossip ran quickly from club to club, from home to
home. But often conversation dared to play on dangerous heights of
politics, religion, and philosophy where it would seldom venture to move
today.</p>
<p>This society was brilliant because women were its life. They were the
deities it worshiped, and they set its tone. Somehow, despite custom and
hindrances, they caught enough education to talk intelligently with the
intellectual lions they loved to entertain. They rivaled the men in
attending</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>2 99</p>
<p>he lectures of scientists. 40 As men lived less in the camp, more in
the capital and at the court, they became increasingly sensitive to the
in- tangible charms of woman — grace of movement, melody of voice,
vivacity of spirit, brightness of eyes, delicacy of tact, tenderness of
solicitude, kind- ness of soul. These qualities had made women lovable
in every civilization; but probably in no other culture had nature,
training, dress, jewelry, and cosmetics made them such bewitching
contraptions as in eighteenth-century France. All these allurements,
however, could not explain the power of women. Intelligence in the
handling of men was needed, and the intelli- gence of women matched and
sometimes overreached the intellect of men. Women knew men better than
men knew women; men came forward too precipitately for ideas to mature
into understanding, while the modest re- treat required even of
receptive women gave them time to observe, experi- ment, and plan their
campaigns.</p>
<p>As male sensitivity widened and deepened, feminine influence grew.
Bravery on the battlefield looked for reward in the salon as well as in
the boudoir and the court; poets were thrilled to find pretty and
patient ears; philosophers were exalted to win a gracious hearing from
women of refine- ment and rank; even the most learned savant discovered
an intellectual stim- ulus in soft bosoms and rustling silk. So, before
their “emancipation,” women exercised a sovereignty that gave its
distinctive character to the age. “Women ruled then,” Mme. Vigee -
Lebrun later recalled; “the Revolution has dethroned them.” 41 They not
only taught manners to men, they ad - vanced or demoted them in
political, even in academic life. So Mme. de Tencin secured the election
of Marivaux, instead of Voltaire, to the Im- mortals in 1742. Cherchez
la jewme was the technique of success; find the woman whom the man
loves, and you find the way to your man.</p>
<p>Claudine Alexandrine de Tencin was, after Pompadour, the most inter-
esting of these women who swayed the powers of France in the first half
of the eighteenth century. We have seen her escaping from a convent and
generating d’Alembert. In Paris she took a home in the Rue St. -Honore,
where she entertained a succession of lovers, including Bolingbroke,
Riche- lieu, Fontenelle (silent but virile at seventy), sundry abbes,
and the head of the Paris police. Gossip added her brother to the list,
but probably she loved Pierre only as a fond sister resolved to make him
a cardinal, if not prime minister. Through him and others she proposed
to be a power in the life of France.</p>
<p>First, she gathered money. She invested in Law’s System, but sold in
good time. She accepted the guardianship of Charles Joseph de La
Fresnai’s for - tune, then refused to return it to him; he killed
himself in her rooms, leav- ing a will denouncing her as a thief ( 1726)
; she was sent to the Bastille, but</p>
<p>300 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>her friends secured her release; she kept most of the money, and
outfaced and outlived all the gossip of the city and the court.</p>
<p>About 1728 she added a salon to her bed as a steppingstone to power.
On Tuesday evenings she entertained for dinner a number of distinguished
men, whom she called her betes, or menagerie: Fontenelle, Montesquieu,
Marivaux, Prevost, Helvetius, Astruc, Marmontel, Henault, Duclos, Mably,
Condorcet, and occasionally Chesterfield. The assemblage was usually all
male; Tencin brooked no rivals at her table. But she gave her “beasts”
free rein, and took no offense at their evident rejection of
Christianity. All ranks were leveled there; count and commoner met on
one level. Here, tradition would later say, was the most brilliant and
searching conversation in all that century of boundless talk. 42</p>
<p>Through her guests, her lovers, and her confessors she pulled strings
that ran from Versailles to Rome. Her brother was not ambitious; he
longed for the quiet simplicity of provincial life; but she saw to it
that he was made archbishop, then cardinal, at last a minister in the
Council of State. She helped to make Mme. de Chateauroux the King’s
mistress, and prodded her to prod him to lead his army in war. She saw
in the lethargy of Louis a source and omen of political decay, and
perhaps she was right in thinking that if she were prime minister the
government would take on more direc- tion and vitality. In her salon men
boldly discussed the degeneration of the monarchy and the possibility of
revolution.</p>
<p>In her old age she lost memory of her sins, allied herself with the
Jesuits, campaigned against the Jansenists, and corresponded intimately
with Pope Benedict XIV, who sent her his portrait in recognition of her
services to the Church. The kindness that had often graced her faults
found many outlets. When Montesquieu’s Spirit of Laws (1748) was
received at first with pub - lic indifference she bought up almost the
whole first edition, and distributed it gratis among her many friends.
She took young Marmontel in tow and mothered him with advice — above
all, to attach himself in friendship to women rather than to men as a
means of rising in the world. 43 She herself, in these years of her
decline, became an author, covering the indiscretion with anonymity; her
two romances were compared by friendly critics with Mme. de La Fayette’s
Trine esse de Cleves.</p>
<p>La Tencin died in 1749, aged sixty- eight. “Where shall I dine on
Tuesdays now?” old Fontenelle wondered, and then answered himself
cheerfully, “Very well; I shall dine at Madame Geoff r in’s.” 44 Perhaps
we shall meet him there.</p>
<p>Almost as old as Tencin’s salon, almost as lasting as Geoffrin’s, was
Mme. du Deffand’s. Orphaned at six (1703), Marie de Vichy -Chamrond was
placed in a convent of some educational repute. She began to reason at
an</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>unseemly age, asking questions alarmingly skeptical; the abbess, at a
loss, turned her over to the learned preacher Massillon, who, unable to
explain the unintelligible, gave her up as beyond salvation. At
twenty-one she be- came Marquise du Deffand through a marriage of
convenience; she soon found her husband intolerably prosaic, and
separated from him by an agree- ment that left her well financed. In
Paris and Versailles she gambled pas- sionately — “I thought of nothing
else”; but after three months and painful losses “I was horrified at
myself and cured myself of that folly.” She did a brief stint as
mistress to the Regent, 45 then passed over to his enemy, the Duchesse
du Maine. At Sceaux she met Charles Henault, president of the Chambre
des Enquetes (Court of Inquiry ) ; he became her lover, and then
subsided into her lifelong friend.</p>
<p>After living for some time with her brother she moved into that same
house in the Rue de Beaune where Voltaire was to die. Already famous for
her beauty, her sparkling eyes, and her merciless wit, she attracted to
her table (1739 f.) a group of celebrities who came to constitute a
salon almost as notable as Tencin’s: Henault, Montesquieu, Voltaire,
Mme. du Chatelet,</p>
<p>Du Deffand had the best mind and the worst character among the salon-
nieres. She was proud, cynical, and more openly selfish than we usually
allow ourselves to appear; when Helvetius’ De I’Esprit labored La Roche
- foucauld’s point that all human motives are egoistic, she remarked,
“Bah!</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>he has only revealed everyon e’s secret.” 47 She could be spitefully
satirical, as in describing Mme. du Chatelet. She had seen all but the
simple and tender sides of French life, and assumed that the poor
shared, as far as their means allowed, all the vices of the rich. She
put no more stock in the uto- pian aspirations of the philosophers than
in the comforting myths of the ancient faith; she shunned conclusions
and preferred good manners. She despised Diderot as a boor, liked and
then hated d’Alembert, and admired Voltaire because he was a seigneur of
manners as well as of the mind. She met him in 1721. When he fled from
Paris she began with him in 1736 a correspondence that is one of the
classics of French literature. Her letters equaled his in subtlety,
penetration, finesse, and art, but fell short of his amiability, ease,
and grace.</p>
<p>At fifty-five she began to lose her sight. She consulted every
specialist, then every quack. When, after three years of struggle, she
became com- pletely blind ( 1754) , she notified her friends that if
they continued to attend her soirees they must put up with a blind old
woman. They came neverthe- less, and Voltaire, from Geneva, assured her
that her wit was even brighter than her eyes had been; he encouraged her
to go on living if only to enrage those who paid her annuities. She
found in Julie de Lespinasse a pretty, vivacious, and charming young
woman who helped her to receive and en- tertain; and now she presided at
her dinners like some blind Homer over a round table of sages and bards.
She moved with dignity and defiance through another twenty-six years.
Her too we hope to meet again.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant age because the women in it were brilliant,
combining brains with beauty beyond any precedent. It was because of
them that French writers warmed thought with feeling and graced
philosophy with wit. How could Voltaire have become Voltaire without
them? Even blunt and cloudy Diderot confessed: “Women accustom us to
discuss with charm and clearness the dryest and thorniest subjects. We
talk to them unceas- ingly; we wish them to listen; we are afraid of
tiring or boring them. Hence we develop a particular method of
explaining ourselves easily, and this method passes from conversation
into style.” 48 Because of w omen French prose became brighter than
poetry, and the French language took on a suave charm, an elegance of
phrase, a courtesy of speech, that made it de- lectable and supreme. And
because of women French art passed from the massive bizarreries of
baroque to a refinement of form and taste that embel- lished every
aspect of French life.</p>
