<h4 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h4>
<p>William Shakespeare</p>
<p>1564 — 16 1 6</p>
<p>I. youth: 1564-85</p>
<p>1 ET US, for the adequacy of this record, summarize what half</p>
<p>^ the world knows about Shakespeare. Now that devout scholarship has
rummaged among his relics for three centuries, it is remarkable how much
we do know — far more than enough to set aside, as not meriting debate,
all doubts about his authorship of nearly all the plays ascribed to his
name.</p>
<p>However, we are not sure about his name. Elizabeth allowed more</p>
<p>freedom of spelling than of religion; the same document might use</p>
<p>different spellings of the same word, and a man might sign his name
variously according to his haste or mood. So contemporaries wrote Mar-
lowe as Mario, Marlin, Marley, Aiorley; and Shakespeare’s six survivi ng
signatures appear to read Willm Shaksp, William Shakespe, Wm Shakspe,
William Shakspere, Willm Shakspere, and William Shakspeare; the now
prevalent spelling has no warrant in his autographs. The last three
signa- tures are all on the same will.</p>
<p>His mother was Mary Arden, of an old Warwickshire family. She</p>
<p>brought to John Shakespeare, son of her father’s tenant, a goodly
dowry in cash and land, and gave him eight children, of whom William was
the third. John became a prosperous businessman in Stratford on Avon,
bought two houses, served his town as ale taster, constable, alderman,
and bailiff, and contributed liberally to the poor. After 1572 his
fortunes fell; he was sued for thirty pounds, he failed to answer, and
an order was issued for his arrest. In 1580, for reasons unknown, he was
required by the court to give security against a breach of the peace. In
1592 he was listed as “not coming monthly to church according to her
Majesty’s laws”; some have concluded from this that he was a “recusant”
Catholic, others that he was a Puritan, others that he dared not face
his creditors. William later restored his father’s finances, and when
the father died (1601) two houses in Henley Street remained in the
Shakespeare name.</p>
<p>The Stratford par ish church registered William’s baptism on April
26, 1 564. Nicholas Rowe, his first biographer, recorded in 1 709 the
Stratford tradition, now generally credited, that the father “bred him .
. . for some</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>THE Age of reasom begins</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>time at a free school . . . But the narrowness of his circumstances,
and the want of his assistance at home, forced his father to withdraw
him from thence.”^ Ben Jonson, in the elegy prefixed to the First Folio
edition of the</p>
<p>Another tradition, recorded by Richard Davies about i68i, described
young William as “much given to all unluckiness in stealing venison and
rabbits, particularly from Sir 〔Thomas〕 Lucy, who had him oft whipped
and sometimes imprisoned.”® On November 27, 1582, when said miscreant
was eighteen, he and Anne Hathaway, then about twenty-five, obtained a
marriage license. Circumstances indicate that Anne’s friends compelle d
Shakespeare to marry her.® In May 1583, six months after the marriage, a
daughter was born to them, whom they named Susanna. Later Anne pre-
sented the poet with twins, who were christened Hamnet and Judith on
February 2, 1585. Probably toward the end of that year Shakespeafe left
his wife and children. We have no record of him between 1585 and 1592,
when we find him an actor in London.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>development: i 592-95</li>
</ol>
<p>The first reference to him there is uncomplimentary. On September 3,
1592, Robert Greene issued from his deathbed a warning to his friends
that they were being displaced in the London theater by “an upstart
Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers hart wrapt in a
Players hyde 〔parody of a line from 5 Henry VI〕 supposes he is as well
able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you; and being an
absolute Johannes fac totum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene
in a</p>
<p>countrey.”* This morsel was prepared for the press as part of
Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit by Henry Chettle, who in a later epistle
offered an apology to one of the two persons (probably Alarlowe and
Shakespeare) who had been attacked by Greene:</p>
<p>With neither of them that take offence was 1 acquainted, and with</p>
<p>one of them I care not if I never be. 〔As to〕 the other … I am
sorry</p>
<p>. . . because myself have seen his demeanour no less civil than he
was excellent in the quality 〔calling〕 he professes. Besides, divers
of wor- ship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues
his</p>
<p>honesty, and his facetious 〔agreeable〕 grace in writing, that
approves his art.®</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 89</p>
<p>There seems no doubt that Greene’s attack and Chettle’s apology
referred</p>
<p>related that he “was received into the playhouse as a servitor” in “a
very mean rank,”® which is probable. But he fretted with ambition,
“desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,” with “not a thought but
turned on dignity.”^ Soon he was acting minor parts, making himself “a
motley to the view”;® then he played the kindly Adam in As You Like It
and the Ghost in Hamlet. Probably he rose to higher roles, for his name
headed the list of actors in Jonson’s Every Man in His Humour (1598),
and in Jon - son’s Sejanus (1604) he and Richard Burbage were specified
as the “prin - cipal tragedians.”® By the end of 1 594 he was a
shareholder in the Chamber- lain’s company of players. It was not as a
dramatist, but as an actor and shareholder in a theatrical company, that
Shakespeare made his fortune.</p>
<p>However, by 1591 he was writing plays. He seems to have begun</p>
<p>as a play doctor, editing, touching up, and adapting manuscripts for
his company. From such work he passed to collaboration; the three parts
of Henry VI 592 ) appear to have been such a composite production.
There- after he wrote plays at the rate of almost two per year —
thirty-six or thirty- eight in all. Several early ones, A Comedy of
Errors (1592), Two Gentle- men of Verona (1594), and Love’s Labour’s
Lost (1594) are lighthearted trifles, frothy with now tiresome badinage;
it is instructive to see that Shakespeare had to grow into greatness by
hard work. But the growth was rapid. Taking a hint from Marlowe’s Edward
II, he found in English</p>
<p>history many a dramatic theme. Richard II (1595) equaled the earlier
play; Richard III (1592) had already surpassed it. In some measure he
fell into the fault of making a whole man out of one quality — the
hunchback King out of treacherous and murderous ambition; but he lifted
the play now and then out of Marlowe’s reach by depth of analysis,
intensity of feeling, and flashes of brilliant phrase; soon “A horse! A
horse! My king - dom for a horse!” was a London cliche.</p>
<p>Then, in Titus Andronicus (1593), genius flagged; imitation took
the</p>
<p>lead and presented a repulsive dance of death. Titus kills his son,
and others kill his son-in-law, on the stage; a bride, raped behind the
scenes, comes on the boards with her hands cut off, her tongue cut out,
her mouth bubbling blood; a traitor chops off Titus’ hand before the
groundlings’ avid eyes; the severed head s of two of Titus’ sons are
displayed; a nurse is killed on stage. Reverent critics have labored to
burden collaborators with part or all of the responsibility for this
slaughter, on the mistaken theory that Shakespeare could not write
nonsense. He wrote reams of it.</p>
<p>It was at about this point in his development that he composed
his</p>
<p>narrative poems and his sonnets. Perhaps the plague that caused the
closing</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, rv</p>
<p>of all London theaters between 1592 and 1594 left him with penurious
leisure, and he thought it advisable to cast a hopeful line to some
patron of poetry. In 1593 he dedicated Venus and Adonis to Henry
Wriothesley, third Earl of Southampton. Lodge had a dapted the tale from
Ovid’s</p>
<p>Metamorphoses; Shakespeare adapted it from Lodge. The Earl was young,
handsome, and addicted to venery; perhaps the poem was spiced to his
taste. Much of it seems jejune to jaded years; but in this proliferated
seduction there are passages of sensuous beauty (e.g., lines 679-708)
such as England had rarely read before. Encouraged by public applause
and a gift from Southampton, Shakespeare issued in 1594 The Ravyshement
of Lucrece, where the seduction was accomplished with a greater economy
of verse. This was the last of his voluntary publications.</p>
<p>About 1593 he began to write, but kept from the press, the sonnets
that first established his pre-eminence among the poets of his time.
Technically the most nearly perfect of Shakespeare’s works, they borrow
heavily from the Petrarchan treasury of sonnet themes — the transitory
beauty of the beloved, her cruel hesitations and inconstancy, the dreary
crawl of unused time, the jealousies and the panting thirst of the
lover, a nd the poet’s boast that in his rhymes the lady’s loveliness
and fame would shine forever. Even some phrases and epithets are
appropriated from Constable, Daniel, Watson, and other sonneteers, who
themselves were links in a chain of pilferings. No one has succeeded in
arranging the sonnets in any con- sistent narrative order; they were the
casual labor of scattered days. We must not take too seriously their
hazy plot — the love of the poet for a young man, his passion for a
“dark lady” of the court, her rejection of him and acceptance of his
friend, the winning of that friend by a rival poet, and Shakespeare’s
despairing dalliance with thoughts of death. It is possible that
Shakespeare, acting before the court, cast looks of distant longing at
the Queen’s ladies in waiting, so intoxicatingly perfumed and gowned; it
is unlikely that he ever spoke to them or followed the scent to the
prey. One such lady, Mary Fitton, became the mistress of the Earl of
Pembroke. She appears to have been blond, but this may have been merely
a passing dye. However, she was unmarried, whereas Shakespeare’s lady
broke her “bed - vow” in loving the poet and his “boy.”^®</p>
<p>In 1609 Thomas Thorpe published the sonnets, apparently without</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s consent. As the au thor supplied no dedication, Thorpe
pro- vided one, to the puzzlement of centuries: “To the onlie begetter
of these ensuing sonnets Mr. W. H. all happinesse and that eternitie
promised by our ever-living poet, wisheth the well-wishing adventurer in
sett ing forth.” The signature, “T. T.,” presumably meant Thomas Thorpe,
but who was “W. H.”? The initials might mean William Herbert, third Earl
of Pem - broke, who had seduced Mary Fitton and was destined, with his
brother</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p>9*</p>
<p>Philip, to receive the dedication of the posthumous First Folio as
“the greatest Maecenas, to learned men, of any peer of his time or
since.” Herbert was only thirteen when the sonnets began (1593), but
their com- position extended to 1598, by which time Pembroke was ripe
for love and patronage. The poet speaks ardently of his “love” for the
“boy”; “love” was then often used for friendship; but Sonnet 20 calls
the lad “the</p>
<p>The important point about the sonnets is not their story but
their</p>
<p>beauty. Many of them (e.g., 29, 30, 33, 55, 64, 66, 71, 97, 106, 117)
are rich in lines whose depth of thought, warmth of feeling, glow of
imagery, or grace of phrase has made them ring for centuries through the
English- speaking world.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MASTERY: 1595-1608</li>
</ol>
<p>But the artifices and restraint of the sonnet clipped the wings of
fancy, and Shakespeare must have rejoiced in the fluent freedom of blank
verse when, still young and ardent, he let himself go in one of the
great love poems of all time. The story of Romeo and Juliet came to
England from the novelle of Masuccio and Bandello; Arthur Brooke
rephrased it in narrative verse (1562); and Shakespeare, following
Brooke and perhaps an earlier play on the subject, staged his Romeo and
Juliet about 1595. The style is cloyed with conceits that may have clung
to his pen from his sonneteering, the metaphors run wild, Romeo is
weakly drawn beside the effervescent Mercutio, and the denouement is a
concatenation of ab- surdities. But who that remembers youth, or has a
dream left in his</p>
<p>soul, can hear that honeyed music of romance without jettisoning all
canons of credibility and rising breathless at the poet’s bidding into
this world of precipitate ardor, trembling solicitude, and melodious
death?</p>
<p>Almost yearly now Shakespeare won a dramatic victory. On June 7,</p>
<p>1594, Elizabeth’s Jewish physician, Rodrigo Lopez, was executed on
the charge of having accepted a bribe to poison the Queen. The evidence
was inconclusive, and Elizabeth long hesitated to sign the death
warrant; but the London populace took his guilt for granted, and
anti-Semitism ran hot in the pubs.^^ Possibly Shakespeare was moved or
commissioned to tap this mood by writing The Merchant of Venice (1596?).
He shared in some measure the feelings of his audience;* he allowed
Shylock to be</p>
<p>• Cf. Two Gentlemen of Verona, V, ii, 3,6; Merry Wives of Windsor,
II, i.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>represented as a comic character in slovenly dress and with a vast
artificial nose; he rivaled Marlowe in bringing out the moneylender’s
hatred and greed; but he gave Shylock some lovable qualities that must
have made the injudicious grieve, and he put into his mouth so bold a
statement of the case for the Jews that competent critics still debate
whether Shylock is pictured as more sinned against than sinning.^^ Here,
above all, Shakespeare showed his skill in weaving into one harmonious
tapestry divers threads of story coming from the Orient and Italy; and
he made the converted Jessica the recipient of such moonstruck poetry as
only a spirit of supreme sensitivity could have conceived.</p>
<p>For five years Shakespeare gave himself chiefly to comedy; perhaps he
had learned that our harassed species reserves its richest rewards for
those who can distract it with laughter or imagination. A Midsummer
Nighfs Dream is powerful nonsense, only redeemed by Mendelssohn; AWs
Well That Ends Well is not salvaged by Helena; Much Ado about
Nothing</p>
<p>lives up to its title; Twelfth Night is bearable only because Viola
makes a very handsome boy; and The Taming of the Shrew is boisterously
in- credible; shrews are never tamed. All these plays were potboilers,
sops to the groundlings, ways of keeping the herd in the pit and the
wolf from the door.</p>
<p>But with the two parts of Henry IV (1597-98) the great magician rose
again to mastery, and mingled clowns and princes — ^Falstaff and Pistol,
Hot- spur and Prince Hal — ^with a success that would have given Sidney
pause. London relished this serving of royal history garnished with
rogues and tarts. Shakespeare carried on with Henry V (1599), at once
moving and amusing his audience with dying Falstaff’s “babbling o’ green
fields,” rousing it with the fanfare of Agincourt, and delighting it
with the bilingual courtship of Princess Kate by the invincible King. If
we may believe Rowe, the Queen was not content to let Falstaff rest; she
bade his creator revive him and show him in love;*® and John Dennis
(1702), relating the same story, adds that Elizabeth desired the miracle
to be accomplished in two weeks. If all this be true. The Merry Wives of
Windsor was an aston- ishing tour de farce; for though the play is noisy
with slapstick and punc- tured with puns, it has Falstaff at the height
of his verve, until he is cast into the river in a hamper of wash. The
Queen, we are told, was pleased.</p>
<p>It is startling to find a dramatist capable of producing in one
season</p>
<p>(1599-1600.^) such nugatory nonsense as this and then so ethereal an
idyl as As You Like It. Perhaps because it took a lead from Lodge’s
novel Rosalynde (1590), the play has a music of refinement in it — still
hobbled with arid badinage, but tender and delicate in feeling, gay and
elegant in speech. What pretty friendship is here between Celia and
Rosalind — and Orlando carving Rosalind’s name into the bark of trees,
“hanging odes upon</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>hawthorns and elegies on brambles”; what a Fortunatus’ fund of
eloquence spilling immortal phrases on every page — and songs that have
been wel- come on a million lips: “Under the greenwood tree,” “Blow,
blow, thou winter wind,” “It was a lover and his lass.” The whole
outpour is such delectable foolery and sentiment as cannot be matched in
any literature.</p>
<p>But amid this cornucopia of sweets Monsieur Melancholy Jaques mingles
some bitter fruit, announcing that lif e’s “wide and universal theatre
pre - sents more woeful pageants than do the scene we play” upon the
boards, that nothing is certain except death, usually after a toothless,
eyeless, taste- less old age.</p>
<p>And so, from hour to hour we ripe and ripe.</p>
<p>And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.</p>
<p>And thereby hangs a tale.^*</p>
<p>So the Swan of Avon warned us that As You Like It was the swan</p>
<p>song of his gaiety, and that thereafter, till further notice, he
proposed to flay the surface of life and show us its bloody reality. Now
he would open his vein of tragedy and mingle gall with his ambrosia.</p>
<p>In 1579 Sir Thomas North’s Plutarch exposed a treasure trove of
drama. Shakespeare took three of the Lives and molded them into The
Tragedy of Julius Caesar (1599?). He found North’s translation so
spirited that he appropriated several passages word for word, merely
measuring the prose into blank verse; however, the speech of Antony over
Caesar’s corpse was the poet’s own invention, a masterpi ece of oratory
and subtlety, and the sole defense he allows to Caesar. His admiration
for Southampton, Pem- broke, and the young Essex may have moved him to
see the assassination from the standpoint of endangered and conspiring
aristocrats; so Brutus b ecomes the center of the play. We, who have
Mommsen’s details as to the odorous corruption of the “democracy” that
Caesar overthrew, are more inclined to sympathize with Caesar, and are
taken aback to find the title character dead at the outset of Act III.
The past is helpless in the hands of the present, which repeatedly
remolds it to the hour’s whim.</p>
<p>In writing Hamlet (1600?), as in Julius Caesar, Shakespeare had the
aid and challenge of an earlier play on the theme; a Hamlet had been
per- formed in London only six years before. We do not know how much he
took from that lost tragedy, or from Fran5ois de Belleforest’s Histoires
tragiques (1576), or from the Historia Danica (1514) of the Danish his-
torian Saxo Grammaticus; nor can we say if Shakespeare read Of the
Diseases of Melancholy, the recent English translation of a French
medical work by Du Laurens. Doubting stoically every attempt to turn
the</p>
<p>plays into autobiography, we are yet warranted in asking whether
some</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>personal grief — ^in addition to the sobering of time — entered into
the pes- simism that cried out in Hamlet and grew bitterer in succeeding
plays. It might have been a second disillusionment with love. Was it the
first arrest of Essex (June 5, 1600), or the collapse of Essex’ revolt,
the arrest of</p>
<p>Essex and Southampton, the execution of Essex (February 25, 1601)?
Presumably these events moved the sensitive poet who had so warmly
praised Essex in the prologue to the last act of Henry V and, in the
dedi- cation to Lucrece, had pledged himself to Southampton forever. In
any case, Shakespeare’s greatest plays were written during or after
these calami - ties. They are subtler in plot, deeper in thought, more
magnificent in langu- age than their predecessors, but also they voice
against life the bitterest re- proaches in all literature. Hamlet’s
vacillating will, and almost his “noble and most sovereign reason,” are
disordered by discovering the reality and the nearness of evil, and by
feeding on the venom of revenge till he him- self sinks to feelingless
cruelty, and sends Ophelia not to a nunnery but to madness and death. In
the end the slaughter is general. Only Horatio sur- vives, too simple to
be mad.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Elizabeth too had found the final balm, and James VI</p>
<p>of Scotland became James I of England. Soon after his accession he
con- firmed and extended the privileges of Shakespeare’s company, which
be - came “the King’s Men.” Shakespeare’s plays were regularly performed
be- fore the King and met with ample royal encouragement. The three
seasons between 1604 and 1607 brought the poet to the fullness of his
genius and his bitterness. Othello (1604?) is as powerful as it is
incredible. The</p>
<p>audience was moved to pity by the devotion and the death of Desdemona
and fascinated by the intelligent malignancy of lago; but in picturing
such unmixed and unmotived evil in a man Shakespeare fell into Marlowe’s
fault of monolithic characters, and even Othello, despite his union of
general- ship and stupidity, lacks that rich admixture of elements which
makes Hamlet and Lear, Brutus and Antony human.</p>
<p>Macbeth (1605?) is a still more macabre contemplation of unmitigated
evil. Shakespeare could cite Holinshed for the stark facts, but he made
the story darker with his passionate disillusionment. The mood reached
its nadir, the art its apogee, in King Lear (1606?). The tale had
been</p>
<p>elaborated by Geoffrey of Monmouth, carried down by Holinshed, and
lately staged by a now unknown dramatist in The True Chronicle of King
Lear (1605); plots were common property. The earlier play had followed
Holinshed in giving Lear a happy ending, through reunion with Cordelia
and restoration to the throne; Shakespeare is apparently guilty of the
King’s madness and dethroned death, and he added the bloody blinding of
Gloucester on the stage. Bitterness is the organ tone of the play. Lear
bids fornication thrive and adultery increase, “for I lack soldiers”;^®

<p>virtue, in his darkened view, is a front for lechery, all government
is</p>
<p>bribery, all history is humanity preying upon itself. He goes mad
perceiv- ing the profundity and the apparent victory of evil, and he
sheds all faith in a sustaining Providence.</p>
<p>Antony and Cleopatra (1607?) reaches lesser heights and depths. There
is something nobler in Antony’s defeat than in Lear’s rage, something
more be lievable and bearable in the Roman’s infatuation with the
Egyptian Queen than in the Briton’s unlikely cruelty to a daughter
absurdly frank; and Cleopatra, cowardly in battle, is magnificent in
suicide. Here too Shakespeare had previous plays to work on, and again
he bettered them, renewing and brightening the oft-told tale with
subtler analyses of char- acter and the unwearied magic and sparkle of
his speech.</p>
<p>In Timon of Athens (1608?) the pessimism is sardonic and unrelieved.
Lear aims his shafts at women, but feels some tardy pity for mankind;
the hero of Coriolanus (1608?) despises the people as the fickle, syco-
phantic, brainless spawn of carelessness; but Timon denounces all, high
or low, and curses civilization itself as having demoralized mankind.
Plutarch in his life of Antony had mentioned Timon as a famous
misanthrope; Lucian had put him in a dialogue; and an English play had
been written about him some eight years before Shakespeare, with an
unknown col- laborator, took up the theme. Timon is an Athenian
millionaire, surrounded by receptive flattering friends. When he loses
his money and sees his friends vanish overnight, he kicks the dust of
civilization from his feet and retires — a Jaques in dour earnest — ^to
a forest solitude, where, he hopes, he “shall find the unkindest beasts
more kinder than mankind.”’® He wishes Alcibiades were a dog, “that I
might love thee something.”” He lives on roots, digs, finds gold.
Friends appear again; he drives them off with lashing scorn; but when
prostitutes come he gives them gold, on condition that they will infect
as many men as possible with venereal disease:</p>

<p>In an ecstasy of hatred he bids nature cease to breed men, and hopes
that vicious beasts may multiply to wipe out the human race. The
excesses of this misanthropy make it seem unreal; we cannot believe that
Shake- speare felt this ridiculous superiority to sinful men, this
cowardly incapacity to stomach life. Such a reductio ad nauseam suggests
that the disease was purging itself, and that Shakespeare would soon
smile again.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ARTISTRY</li>
</ol>
<p>How did a man of so little education come to write plays of such
varied erudition? But it was not really erudition. In no field except
psychology was it extensive or accurate. Shakespeare knew the Bible only
so far as his boyhood studies might have opened it to him; his Biblical
references are incidental and ordinary. His classical learning was
casual, careless, and ap- parently confined to translations. He knew
most of the pagan deities, even the lesser or looser ones, but this
knowledge could have been from the English version of Ovid’s
Metamorphoses. He made little errors that</p>
<p>He had little French and less Italian. He had some knowledge of geog-
raphy, and gave his plays exotic locales from Scotland to Ephesus; but
he gave Bohemia a seacoast,* and he sent Valentine by sea from Verona to
Milan,^® and Prospero from Milan in an ocean-going vessel.®* He took
much of his Roman history from Plutarch, of his English history from
Holinshed and from earlier plays. He made historical faux-pas
unimportant to a dramatist: put a clock in Caesar’s Rome, billiards in
Cleopatra’s Egypt.</p>
<p>Like other Elizabethan dramatists, Shakespeare used many legal
terms,</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Jonson pounced upon this in his talks with Drummond at
Hawthomden.^^ Shake- speare took it from a novel by Robert Greene — a
university graduate. Under Ottokar II (r. 1253-78) Bohemia extended her
rule to the Adriatic shores.^-</li>

<p>97</p>
<p>sometimes improperly; he could have gleaned them in the Inns of Court
— the law schools in which three of his plays were staged — or in the
several lawsuits engaged in by his father or himself. He is rich in
musical terms and was evidently sensitive to music — “Is it not strange
that sheeps’ guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies?”*® He lovingly
remembers the flowers of England, strings them on a rosary in The
Winter’s Tale, and decks Ophelia with them in her delirium; he alludes
to i8o different</p>
<p>plants. He was acquainted with the sports of the field and the points
of a horse. But he had little interest in science, which was soon to
fascinate Bacon. Like Bacon, he retained the Ptolemaic astronomy.<em>®
At times (Sonnet 15) he seems to accept astrology, and he speaks of
Romeo and Juliet as “star - crossed lovers”;</em>^ but Edmund in Lear
and Cassius in</p>
<p>Julius Caesar vigorously reject it: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”*®</p>
<p>All in all, the evidence indicates that Shakespeare had the
incidental learning of a man of affairs too busy with acting, managing,
and living to sink his head into books. He knew the more startling o f
Machiavelli’s ideas, he referred to Rabelais, he borrowed from
Montaigne; but it is unlikely that he read their works. Gonzalo’s
description of an ideal commonwealth*®</p>
<p>The originality is in the language, the style, the imagination, the
dramatic technique, the humor, the characters, and the philosophy. The
language is the richest in all literature: fifteen thousand words,
including the techni- cal terms of heraldry, music, sports, and the
professions, the dialects of the shires, the argot of the pavement, and
a thousand hurried or lazy inventions — occulted, unkenneled, fumitory,
burnet, spurring . . . He relished words and explored the nooks and
crannies of the language; he loved words in general and poured them
forth in frolicsome abandon; if he names a flower he must go on to name
a dozen — the words themselves are fragrant. He makes simple characters
mouth polysyllabic circumlocu- tions. He plays jolly havoc with the
grammar: turns nouns, adjectives, even adverbs into verbs, and verbs,
adjectives, even pronouns into nouns;</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>gives a plural verb to a singular subject or a singular verb to a
plural sub- ject; but there were as yet no grammars of English usage, no
rules. Shake- speare wrote in haste, and had no leisure to repent.</p>
<p>The marvelous style, “manneristic and baroque,”*® has the faults of
its lawless wealth: phrases fancifully artificial or involved,
farfetched images, word plays tiresomely elaborate; puns amid tragedy,
metaphors falling over one another in contradictory confusion,
repetitions innumerable, sen- tentious platitudes, and, now and then,
hilarious, nonsensical bombast fill- ing the unlikeliest mouths.
Doubtless a classical training would have chas- tened the style,
silenced the doubles-entendres; but then consider what we should have
lost. Perhaps he was thinking of himself when he made Ferdinand describe
Adriano as a man</p>
<p>That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</p>
<p>One whom the music of his own vain tongue</p>
<p>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony . . .</p>

<p>From this mint issued an almost universal currency of phrases:

wind in that corner? ;<strong> uneasy lies the head that wears a

of metaphors another thousand, of which one may serve — “to see the
sails conceive and grow big -bellied with the wanton wind.”** And entire
passages now almost as familiar as the phrases: Ophelia’s disordered h
erbal of flowers, Antony over dead Caesar, Cleopatra dying, Lorenzo on
the music of the spheres. And a whole repertoire of songs: “Who is
Silvia?,”*® “Hark, hark! the lark at - spe are’s audience came for his

<p>he be disallowed? Who else (but Blake) would have made the banished
Duke, in As You Like It, regret that he must live by hunting beasts so
often more beautiful than man? Little wonder that a spirit so keen in
every sense should have reacted passionately against the ugliness,
greed, cruelty, lust, pain, and grief that seemed at times to dominate
the panorama of the world.</p>
<p>His originality is least in dramatic technique. As a man of the
theater he knew the tricks of his trade. He began his plays with scenes
or words calculated to jolt the attention of his nut-cracking,
card-playing, ale-swill- ing, woman-ogling audience. He took full
advantage of the abundant “properties” and machinery of the Elizabethan
stage. He studied his fellow actors and created parts suitable to their
physical and mental peculiarities. He used all the jugglery of disguises
and recognitions, all the shifts of scenery and the complications of a
play within a play. But in his crafts- manship he shows some scars of
haste. Sometimes the plot within the plot tears the tale in two; what
has Gloucester’s tragedy to do with Lear’s? Almost all the stories turn
on improbable coincidences, concealed identities, highly opportune
revelations; we may be’ reasonably asked to make be- lieve, in drama as
in opera, for the sake of the story or the song, but an artist should
reduce to a minimum the “baseless fabric” of his dream. Less important
are the inconsistencies of time or character;®* presumably Shakespeare,
thinking of rapid production, not of careful publication, judged that
these flaws would pass unnoticed by an excited audience. Clas- sical
norms and modern taste alike condemn the violence that often dyes
Shakespeare’s stage; this was another concession to the pit, and an
effort to meet the competition of the slaughterhouse school of
Elizabethan- Jacobean dramatists.</p>
<p>As he developed, Shakespeare redeemed the violence with humor and
learned the difficult art of intensifying tragedy with comic relief. The
early comedies are wit and humor unrelieved, the early historical plays
are stodgy for lack of humor; in Henry IV tragedy and comedy alternate
but are not well integrated; in Hamlet the integration is achieved.
Some- times the humor seems too broad; Sophocles and Racine would have
turned up their classical noses at the jokes about human flatulence®^ or
equine micturition.®® An erotic quip now and then is more to the modern
taste. Generally, Shakespeare’s humor is good -natured, not the savage
mis- anthropy of Swift; he felt that the world was better for a clown or
two; he suffered fools patiently, and emulated God in seeing little
difference between them and world-explaining philosophers.</p>
<p>His greatest clown rivals Hamlet as Shakespeare’s supreme achievement
in the creation of character — which is the supreme test of a dramatist.

<p>Brutus and Antony rise out of the limbo of history into a second
life. Not in Greek drama, not even in Balzac, are imagined persons so
endowed with consistent character and vital force. Most real are those
creations that only seem contradictory because of their complexity —
^Lear cruel and then tender, Hamlet thoughtful and impetuous, hesitant
and brave. Sometimes the characters are too simple — ^Richard III merely
villainy, Timon merely cynicism, lago merely hate. Some of the women in
Shakespeare seem plucked from the same mold — ^Beatrice and Rosalind,
Cordelia and Des- demona, Miranda and Hermione — and lose reality, and
then at times a few words make them live; so Ophelia, told by Hamlet
that he had never loved her, answers without recrimination, but with sad
and moving simplic- ity, “I was the more deceived.” Observation,
feeling, empathy, astonish - ing receptivity of senses, penetrating
perception, alert selection of signi- ficant and characteristic detail,
tenacious remembering, come together to people this living city of dead
or imagined souls. Play after play these personae grow in reality,
complexity, and depth, until, in Hamlet and Lear, the poet matures into
a philosopher and his dramas become the glowing vehicles of thought.</p>
<p>V. PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>“Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?”®* So Touchstone asks Corin,
and we ask Shakespeare. One of his confessed rivals gave a negative
answer to the question;®^ and we may accept that judgment as Bernard
Shaw meant it — that there is no metaphysics in Shakespeare, no view as
to the ultimate nature of reality, no theory of God. Shakespeare was too
wise to think that a creature could analyze his creator, or that even
his mind, poised on a moment of flesh, could comprehend the whole.
“There are more things in heaven and ear th, Horatio, than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.”®* If he made a guess he kept it to himself, and
perhaps thereby proved h’m- self a philosopher. He speaks with no
reverence of professed philosophers, and doubts that any of them ever
bore the toothache patiently.®* He laughs at logic and prefers
imagination’s light; he does not offer to solve the mysteries of life or
mind, but he feels and visions them with an intensity that shames or
deepens our hypotheses. He stands aside and watches the dogmatists
destroy one another or disintegrate in the catalysis of time. He hides
himself in his characters and is hard to find; we must beware of
attributing an opinion to him unless it is expressed with some emphasis
by at least two of his creations.</p>
<p>He is at first sight more of a psychologist than a philosopher; but
again not as a theorist but, rather, as a mental photographer, catching
the secret</p>
<p>CHAP, rv)</p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p>lOI</p>
<p>thoughts and symptomatic actions that reveal the nature of a man.
How- ever, he is no surface realist; things do not happen, people do not
speak, in life as in his plays; but in the sum we feel that through
these improbabilities and extravagances we are nearing the core of human
instinct and thought. Sh akespeare knows as well as Schopenhauer that
“reason panders will”;®® he is quite Freudian in putting erotic ditties
into the virgin mouth of the starved and crazed Ophelia; and he reaches
beyond Freud to Dostoevski in studying Macbeth and his “worser”
half.</p>
<p>If we interpret philosophy not as metaphysics but as any large
perspec- tive of human affairs, as a generalized view not only of the
cosmos and the mind but as well of morals, politics, history, and faith,
Shakespeare is a philosopher, profounder than Bacon, as Montaigne is
deeper than Des- cartes; it is not form that makes philosophy. He
recognizes the relativity of morals: “There’s nothing good or bad but
thinking makes it so,”®^ and “our virtues lie in the interpretation of
the time.”®^ He feels the puzzle of determinism: some men are bad by
heredity, “wherein they are not guilty, since nature 〔character〕
cannot choose his origin.”®® He knows the Thrasymachus theory of morals:
Richard III holds that “conscience is but a word that cowards use,
devised at first to keep the strong in awe; our strong arms be our
conscience, swords our law”;®* Richard II judges that</p>
<p>Men must endure</p>
<p>Their going hence even as their coming hither:</p>
<p>Ripeness is all . .</p>
<p>Death is forgivable if it comes after we have fulfilled ourselves.
Shakespeare welcomes Epicurus, too, and admits no inherent contradiction
between pleasure and wisdom. He snaps at the Puritans, and makes the
maid Maria tell Malvolio, “Go shake your ears”®* — ^i.e., “You’re an
ass.” He is as lenient as a pope to sins of the flesh, and puts into the
mad Lear’s mouth a hilarious paean to copulation.’^®</p>
<p>His political philosophy is conservative. He knew the sufferings of
the poor and made Lear voice them feelingly. A fisherman in Pericles
(1609?) notes that fishes live in the sea</p>

<p>mouthful: such whales have I heard on o’ the land, who nev er leave
gaping till they’ve swallowed the whole parish, church, steeple,</p>
<p>bells, and all.’^^</p>
<p>Gonzalo, in The Tempest, dreams of an anarchistic communism where
“all things in common nature should produce,” and there should be no
laws, no magistrates, no labor, and no war;’^® but Shakespeare smiles
this utopia away as made impossible by the nature of man; under every
con- stitution the whales will eat the fish.</p>
<p>What was Shakespeare’s religion? Here especially the search for his
philosophy is difficult. He expresses through his characters almost
every faith, and with such tolerance as must have made the Puritans
think him an infidel. He quotes the Bible often and reverently, and lets
Hamlet, sup- posedly skeptical, talk belie vingly of God, prayer,
heaven, and hell.’‘® Shakespeare and his children were baptized
according to Anglican rites.’^^ Some of his lines are vigorously
Protestant. King John speaks of papal pardons as “juggling witchcraft,”
and quite anticipates Henry V III:</p>
<p>… no Italian priest</p>
<p>Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;</p>
<p>But as we, under heaven, are supreme head.</p>
<p>So, under Him, that great supremacy.</p>
<p>Where we do reign, we will alone uphold . . .</p>
<p>So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart</p>
<p>To him and his usurpt authority.^®</p>
<p>Though, of course, John goes to Canossa in the end. A later play,</p>
<p>Henry Vlll, only partly by Shakespeare, gives very favorable pictures
of Henry and Cranmer and ends with a eulogy of Elizabeth — all chief
archi- tects of the Reformation in England. There are some pro-Catholic
touches, as in the sympathetic portrayal of Catherine of Aragon and
Friar Law- rence;^® but the latter character had come to Shakespeare as
formed in the novelle of Italian Catholics.</p>
<p>Some faith in God survives throughout the tragedies. Lear in his
bitter- ness thinks that</p>
<p>As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, —</p>
<p>They kill us for their sport.”</p>
<p>But: “The gods are just,” answers the good Edgar, “and of our
pleasant vices make i nstruments to plague us”;’® and Hamlet affirms his
faith in “a</p>
<p>CHAP. IV )</p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>divinity that doth shape our ends, rough- hew them how we will.”^®
Despite this struggling faith in a Providence that deals with us justly
there is, in Shakespeare’s greatest plays, a spreading cloud of unbelief
in life itself. Jaques sees in all the “seven ages” of man nothing but
slow riping and fast rotting. We hear the same refrain in King John:</p>
<p>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale</p>
<p>Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;®®</p>
<p>and in Hamlet’s scorn of the world:</p>
<p>Fie on’t! O, fie! ’tis an un weeded garden.</p>
<p>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</p>
<p>Possess it merely;®^</p>
<p>and in Macbeth’s</p>
<p>Out, out, brief candle!</p>
<p>Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor player</p>
<p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</p>
<p>And then is heard no more: it is a tale</p>
<p>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury.</p>
<p>Signifying nothing.®^</p>
<p>Does any sense of immortality soften this pessimism? Lorenzo, after
describing to Jessica the music of the spheres, adds that “such harmony
is in immortal souls.”®® Claudio, in Measure for Measure, visions an
afterlife, but in somber terms of Dante’s Inferno or Pluto’s Hades:</p>
<p>Ah, but to die, and go we know not where;</p>
<p>To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;</p>
<p>This sensible warm motion to become</p>
<p>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</p>
<p>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</p>
<p>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;</p>
<p>To be imprison’d in the viewless winds.</p>
<p>And blown with restless violence round about</p>
<p>The pendent world . . . ’tis too horrible !®’‘</p>
<p>Hamlet speaks casually of the soul as immortal,®® but his soliloquy
affirms no faith; and his dying words in the older version of the play,
“Heaven</p>
<p>We cannot say with confidence how much of this pessimism came
from</p>
<p>104 the age of reason begins (chap. IV</p>
<p>the demands of tragic drama and how much voiced Shakespeare’s mood;
but its repetition and emphasis suggest that it expressed the darker
moments of his philosophy. The sole mitigation of it in these
culminating plays is a hesitant recognition that amid the evils of this
world there are blessings and delights, amid the villains many heroes
and some saints — for every lago a Desdemona, for every Goneril a
Cordelia, for every Edmund an Edgar or a Kent; even in Haml et a fresh
wind blows from Horatio’s faithfulness and Ophelia’s wistful tenderness.

</ol>
<p>However, he had no obvious reason to complain of London. It had given
him success, acclaim, and fortune. There are over two hundred references
to him, almost all favorable, in the surviving literature of his time.
In 1598 Francis Meres’s Palladis Tamia: Wits Treasury listed Sidney,
Spenser, Daniel, Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Chapman, in
that order, as England’s leading authors, and ranked Shakespeare first
among the dramatists.®® In that same year Richard Barnfield, a rival
poet, declared that Shakespeare’s work (of which the best was yet to
come) had already placed his name in “Fame’s immortal Book.”®^ He was
popular even with his competitors. Drayton and Jonson and Burbage were
among his closest friends; and though Jonson criticized his inflated
style, his careless facility in composition, and his outrageous neglect
of classic rules, it was Jonson who, in the First Folio, rated
Shakespeare above all other dramatists an- cient or modern and judged
him to be “not of an age, but for all time.” In the papers that Jonson
left at his death he wrote, “I loved the man . . . this side
idolatry.”®®</p>
<p>Tradition joins Jonson with Shakespeare in the meetings of literary
men at the Mermaid Tavern in Bread Street. Francis Beaumont, who knew
them both, exclaimed:</p>
<p>What things have we seen</p>
<p>Done at the Mermaid! — heard words that have been</p>
<p>So nimble and so full of subtle flame</p>
<p>As if that everyone from whence they came</p>
<p>Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest.</p>
<p>And had resolved to live a fool the rest</p>
<p>Of his dull life.®®</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>And Thomas Fuller’s Worthies of England (1662) reported:</p>
<p>Many were the wit combats betwixt Shakespeare and Ben Jonson,</p>
<p>which two I behold like a Spanish great galleon and an English man-
of-war. Master Jonson (like the former) was built far higher in learn-
ing, solid but slow in his performances. Shakespeare . . . lesser in
bulk but lighter in sailing, could turn with all tides, tack about, and
take</p>
<p>advantage of all winds by the quickness of his wit and
invention.®®</p>
<p>Aubrey, about 1680, continued the easily credible tradition of Shake-
speare’s “very ready and pleasant smooth wit,” and added that he “was a
handsome, well- shaped man, very good company.”®^ The only extant like -
nesses of him are the bust placed over his tomb in the Stratford church
and the engraving prefixed to the First Folio; they agree well enough,
showing a man half bald, with mustache and (in the bust) beard, sharp
nose, and meditative eyes, but giving no sign of the flame that burns in
the plays. Perhaps the plays mislead us about his character; they
suggest a man of high-strung energy and passion fluctuating between the
summits of thought and poetry and the depths of melancholy and despair;
while his contemporaries describe him as civil and honest, slow to take
offense, “of an open and free nature,”®^ enjoying life, careless of
posterity, and showing a vein of practicality unbecoming a poet. Whether
by thrift or gift, he was already rich enough in 1598 to join in
financing the Globe theater; and in 1608 he and six others built the
Blackfriars. His shares in these enterprises, added to his earnings as
actor and playwright, gave him a substantial income — diversely
estimated between ;^2oo®® and £600^* a year. The latter figure seems
better able to explain his purchases of Strat- ford realty.</p>
<p>“He was wont,” says Aubrey, “to go to his native country once a
year.”®® Sometimes he stopped on the way at Oxford, where a John
Davenant kept an inn; Sir William Davenant (poet laureate in 1637) liked
to suggest that he was the unpremeditated result of Shakespeare’s
dalliance there.®® In 1597 the dramatist, for sixty pounds, bought New
Place, the second-largest house in Stratford, but he continued to live
in London. His father died in 1601, leaving him two houses in Henley
Street, Stratford. A year later, for ;C32o, he bought near the town 127
acres of land, which he probably leased to tenant farmers. In 1605 he
bought for ^44° ^ share in the pros- pective ecclesiastical tithes of
Stratford and three other communities. While he was writing his greatest
plays in London he was known in Stratford chiefly as a successful
businessman, frequently engaged in litigation about his properties and
investments.</p>
<p>His son Hamnet had died in 1 596. In 1 607 his daughter Susanna
married John Hall, a prominent Stratford physician, and a year later she
made the</p>

<p>poet a grandfather. He had now new ties to draw him homeward. About
i6io he retired from London and the stage and moved into New Place.
Apparently it was there that he composed Cymbeline (1609?), The Win-
ter^s Tale (1610?), and The Tempest (1611?). Two of these are of minor
rank, but The Tempest shows Shakespeare still master of his powers. Here
is Miranda, who at the outset reveals her nature when, seeing a
shipwreck from the shore, she cries out, “Oh, I have suffered with those
that I saw suffer!”®^ Here is Caliban, Shakespeare’s answer to Rousseau.
Here is Prospero, the kindly magician, surrendering the wand of his art
and bid- ding his airy world a fond goodbye. There is an echo of the
poet’s mel - ancholy in the undiminished eloquence of Prospero’s
lines:</p>
<p>Our revels now are ended. These our actors.</p>
<p>As I foretold you, were all spirits, and</p>
<p>Are melted into air, into thin air:</p>
<p>And, like the baseless fabric of this vision.</p>
<p>The cloud- capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces.</p>
<p>The solemn temples, the great globe itself.</p>
<p>Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve.</p>
<p>And, like this insubstantial pageant faded.</p>
<p>Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</p>
<p>As dreams are made on; and our little life</p>
<p>Is rounded with a sleep.^®</p>
<p>But this is not now the dominant mood; on the contrary, the play
is</p>
<p>Shakespeare relaxing, talking of brooks and flowers, singing songs
like “Full fathom five” and “Where the bee sucks, there suck I.” And,
despite all cautious demurrers, it is the aging poet who speaks through
Prospero’s farewell:</p>
<p>. . . graves at my command</p>
<p>Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth</p>
<p>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</p>
<p>I here abjure . . . I’ll break my staff,</p>
<p>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth.</p>
<p>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</p>
<p>I’ll drown my book.®®</p>
<p>And perhaps it is Shakespeare again, rejoiced by his daughters and
his grandchild, who cries out, through Miranda:</p>
<p>O wonder!</p>
<p>How many goodly natures are there here!</p>
<p>How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world</p>
<p>That hath such people in it!^®®</p>

<p>On February lo, i6i6, Judith married Thomas Quiney. On March 25</p>
<p>Shakespeare made his will. He left his property to Susanna, £300
to</p>
<p>Judith, small bequests to fellow actors, and his “second - best bed”
to his estranged wife. Perhaps he had arranged with Susanna to take care
of her mother. Anne Hathaway survived him by seven years. In April, ac-
cording to John Ward, vicar (1662-81) of Stratford Church, “Shake -</p>
<p>speare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry party, and it seems drank
too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there
contracted.”*<sup>®</sup> Death came on April 23, 1616. The body was
buried under the chancel of the Stratford church. Nearby on the floor,
graved on a stone bearing no name, is an epitaph which local tradition
ascribes to Shakespeare’s hand:</p>
<p>Good friend, for Jesus sake forbeare</p>
<p>To DIGG THE DUST ENCLOASED HEARE.</p>
<p>BlESE BE YE MAN YT 〔tHAT〕 SPARES THES STONES,</p>
<p>And CURST be he yt moves my bones.</p>

<p>He had, so far as we know, taken no steps to have his plays
published; the sixteen that severally appeared in his lifetime were
printed, apparently, without his co-operation, usually in quarto form,
and in various degrees of textual corruption. Stirred by these piracies,
two of his former associates, John Heming and Henry Condell, issued in
1623 the First Folio, contain- ing in one tall volume of some nine
hundred double-column pages the authoritative text of thirty- six of the
plays. “We have but . . . done an office to the dead,” said the
foreword, “. . . without ambition either of self-profit or fame; only to
keep the memory of so worthy a friend . . . alive as was our
Shakespeare.” The volume could then be bought for a pound; each of the
approximately two hundred extant copies is now valued at £ 17,000, more
highly than any book except Gutenberg’s Bible.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s reputation fluctuated curiously in time. Milton (1630)
praised “sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy’s child,” but during the Puritan
inter - val, when the theaters were closed (1642-60), the fame of the
bard faded. It revived with the Restoration. Sir John Suckling, in his
portrait by</p>
<p>Vandyck (in the Frick Gallery, New York), holds the First Folio
open</p>
<p>at Hamlet. Dryden, the oracle of the later seventeenth century, com-
mended Shakespeare as having, “of all modern, and perhaps ancient, poets
. . . the largest and most comprehensive soul . . . always great when
some great occasion is presented to him,” but “many times flat, insipid,
his comic</p>
<p>• “There is no reason to reject this report.” — Sir E. K. Chambers,
William Shakespeare,</p>
<p>I, 89.</p>
<p>Io8 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>art degenerating into clenches, his serious swelling into
bombast.”^®* John Evelyn noted in his diary (i66i) that “the old plays
disgust this refined age, since his Majesty’s being so long abroad” —
i.e., since Charles II and the returning royalists had brought to
England the dramatic norms of France; soon afterward the Restoration
theater produced the bawdiest dramas in modern literature. Shakespeare’s
plays were still performed, but usually in “adaptation” by Dryden,
Otway, or other models of Res- toration taste.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century restored the plays to Shakespeare. Nicholas
Rowe published (1709) the first critical edition and the first
biography. Pope and Johnson issued editions and commentaries; Betterton,
Garrick, Kemble, and Mrs. Siddons made Shakespeare popular on the stage
as never before; and Thomas Bowdler made his own name a verb by pub-
lishing (1818) an expurgated version omitting parts “which cannot with
propriety be read aloud in a fam ily.” In the early nineteenth century
the romantic movement took Shakespeare to its heart, and the
superlatives of Coleridge, Hazlitt, De Quincey, and Lamb transformed him
into a tribal god.</p>
<p>France demurred. By 1700 its literary standards had been formed by
Ronsard, Malherbe, and Boileau in the Latin tradition of order, logical
form, polite taste, and rational control; it had adopted, in Racine, the
classical rules of drama; it was disturbed by Shakespeare’s windy word
play, his bubbling torrent of phrases, his emotional storms, his coarse
clowns, his mingling of comedy with tragedy. Voltaire, returning from
England in 1729, brought with him some appreciation of Shakespeare and
“first showed the French a few pearls which I found in his enormous
dunghill”;^®* but when someone ranked the Englishman above Racine,
Voltaire rose to the defense of France by calling Shakespeare “an
amiable barbarian.”<sup>®</sup> His Philosophical Dictionary (1765) made
some amends: “In this same man there are passages which exalt the
imagination and penetrate the heart. . . . He reaches sublimity without
having searched for it.”^®® Mme. de Stael (1804), Guizot (1821), and
Villemain (1827) helped France to bear with Shakespeare. Finally the
translation of the plays into go od French prose by Victor Hugo’s son
Francois won Shakespeare the respect of France, though never the devout
admiration there accorded to Racine.</p>
<p>The bard had a better press in Germany, where no native playwright
contested the prize. It was Germany’s first great dramatist, Gotthold
Les- sing, who in 1759 informed his countrymen that Shakespeare was
superior to all other poets, ancient or modem; and Herder supported him.
August von Schlegel, Ludwig Tieck, and other leaders of the Romantic
school raised the Shakespearean banner, and Goethe contributed an
enthusiastic</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 109</p>
<p>discussion of Hamlet in Wilhelm Meister (1796).^®® Shakespeare became
popular on the German stage; and for a time German scholarship snatched
the lead from England in the clarification of Shakespeare’s life and
plays.</p>
<p>For those brought up in the aura of Shakespeare an objective estimate
or comparison is impossible. Only one who knows the language, the reli-
gion, the art, the customs, and the philosophy of the Periclean Greeks
will feel the unequaled dignity of the Dionysian tragic drama, the
stark</p>
<p>simplicity and inexorable logic of its structure, its proud
self-restraint in word and deed, the moving commentary of its choral
chants, the high enterprise of seeing man in the perspective of his
cosmic place and destiny. Only one who knows the French language and
character, and the back- ground of the grand siecle, can feel, in the
plays of Corneille and Racine, not merely the majesty and music of their
verse, but as well the heroic effort of reason to overspread emotion and
impulse, the stoic adherence to difficult classic norms, the
concentration of the drama into a few tense hours summarizing and
deciding lives. Only one who knows English in its Elizabethan fullness,
who can ride with gusto the Elizabethan winds of rhetoric, lyric, and
vituperation, who puts no bounds to the theater’s</p>
<p>(But, of course, Shakespeare is supreme.)</p>
