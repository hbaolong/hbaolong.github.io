<h4 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>Justinian</p>
<p>527-565</p>
<p>I. THE EMPEROR</p>
<p>I N 408 Arcadius died, and his son Theodosius II, aged seven, became
Emperor of the East. Theodosius’ sister Pulcheria, having the
advantage</p>
<p>Between Theodosius II and Justinian I the Eastern Empire had many
rulers who in their day made great stir, but are now less than memories:
the lives of great men all remind us how brief is immortality. Leo I
(457-74) sent against Gaiseric (467) the greatest fleet ever assembled
by a Roman government; it was defeated and destroyed. His son-in-law
Zeno the Isaurian (474-9 1 ) , anxious to quiet the Monophysites, caused
a bitter schism between Greek and Latin Christianity by imperially
deciding, in his “unifying” letter, the Hevoticon , that there was but
one nature in Christ. Anastasius (491-518) was a man of ability,
courage, and good will; he restored the finances of the state by wise
and economical administration, reduced taxes, abolished the contests of
men with wild beasts at the games, made Constantinople almost
impregnable by building the “Long Walls” f or forty miles from the Sea
of</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO4</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>Marmora to the Black Sea, expended state funds on many other useful
public works, and left in the treasury 320,000 pounds of gold
(34,400,000), which made possible the conquests of Justinian. The
populace resented his economies and his Monophysite tendencies; a mob
besieged his palace, and killed three of his aides; he appeared to them
in all the dignity of his eighty years, and offered to resign if the
people could agree on a successor. It was an impossible condition, and
the crowd ended by begging him to retain the crown. When presently he
died, the throne was usurped by Justin, an illit- erate senator
(518-27), who so loved his septuagenarian ease that he left the
management of the Empire to his brilliant regent and nephew
Justinian.</p>
<p>Procopius, his historian and enemy, would have been dissatisfied with
Justinian from birth, for the future emperor was born (482) of lowly
Illyrian — perhaps Slavic 1 — peasants near the ancient Sardica, the
modern Sofia. His uncle Justin brought him to Constantinople, and
procured him a good edu- cation. Justinian so distinguished himself as
an officer in the army, and as for nine years aide and apprentice to
Justin, that when the uncle died (527), the nephew succeeded him as
emperor.</p>
<p>He was now forty-five, of medium height and build, smooth shaven,
ruddy faced, curly haired, with pleasatit manners and a ready smile that
could cover a multitude of aims. He was as abstemious as an anchorite,
eating little and subsisting mostly on a vegetarian regimen; 2 he fasted
often, sometimes to exhaustion. Even during these fasts he continued his
routine of rising early, devoting himself to state affairs “from early
dawn to midday, and fa r into the night.” Frequently when his aides
thought he had retired, he was absorbed in study, eager to become a
musician and an architect, a poet and a lawyer, a theologian and a
philosopher, as well as an emperor; nevertheless he retained most of the
superstitions of his time. His mind was constantly active, equally at
home in large designs and minute details. He was not phys- ically strong
or brave; he wished to abdicate in the early troubles of his reign, and
never took the field in his many wars. Perhaps it was a defect of his
ami- ability that he was easily swayed by his friends, and therefore
often vacillated in policy; frequently he subordinated his judgment to
that of his wife. Pro- copius, who devoted a volume to Justinian’s
faults, called him “insincere, crafty, hypocritical, dissembling his
anger, double-dealing, clever, a perfect artist in acting out an opinion
which he pretended to hold, and even able to produce tears … to the need
of the moment”; 3 but this might be a descrip - t ion of an able
diplomat. “He was a fickle friend,” continues Procopius, “a truceless
enemy, an ardent devotee of assassination and robbery.” Apparently he
was these at times; but he was also capable of generosity and lenience.
A general, Probus, was accused of reviling him, and was tried for
treason; when the report of the trial was laid before Justinian he tore
it up and sent a mes- sage to Probus: “I pardon you for your offense
against me; pray that God</p>
<p>CHAP, y) JUSTINIAN IO5</p>
<p>also may pardon yo u.” 4 He bore frank criticism without resentment.
“This tyrant,” so unfortunate in his historian, “was the most accessible
person in the world. For even men of low estate and altogether obscure
had complete freedom not only to come before him but to con verse with
him.” 5</p>
<p>At the same time he promoted the pomp and ceremony of his court even
beyond the precedents of Diocletian and Constantine. Like Napoleon, he
keenly missed the support of legitimacy, having succeeded to a usurper;
he had no prestige of presence or origin; consequently he resorted to an
awe- inspiring ritual and pageantry whenever he appeared in public or
before foreign ambassadors. He encouraged the Oriental conception of
royalty as divine, applied the term sacred to his person and his
property, and required those who came into his presence to kneel and
kiss the hem of his purple robe, or the toes of his buskined feet.* He
had himself anointed and crowned by the patriarch of Constantinople, and
wore a diadem of pearls. No govern- ment has ever made so much ado as
the Byzantine to ensure popular reverence through ceremonial splendor.
The policy was reasonably effective; there were many revolutions in
Byzantine history, but these were mostly coups d’etat of the palace
personnel; the court was not awed by its own solemnity.</p>
<p>The most significant revolt of the reign came early (532), and nearly
cost Justinian his life. The Greens and Blues — the factions into which
the people of Constantinople divided according to the dress of their
favorite jockeys — had brought their quarrels to the point of open
violence; the streets of the capital had become unsafe, and the
well-to-do had to dress like paupers to avoid the nocturnal knife.
Finally the government pounced down upon both factions, arresting
several protagonists. The factions thereupon united in an armed uprising
against the government. Probably a number of senators joined in the
revolt, and proletarian discontent strove to make it a revolution. Pris-
ons were invaded,, and their inmates freed; city police and officials
were killed; fires were started that burned down the church of
St. Sophia and part of the Emperor’s palace. The crowd cried out “ Nika
/” (victory)— and so gave a name to the revolt. Drunk with success, it
demanded the dismissal of two unpopular, perhaps oppressive, members of
Justinian’s council; and he complied. Emboldened, the rebels persuaded
Hypatius, of the senatorial class, to accept the throne; against the
pleading of his wife he accepted, and .vent amid the plaudits of the
crowd to take the imperial seat at the Hippo- drome games. Meanwhile
Justinian hid in his palace, and meditated flight; the Empress Theodora
dissuaded him, and called for active resistance. Beli- sarius, leader of
the army, took the assignment, assembled a number of Goths from his
troops, led them to the Hippodrome, slaughtered 30,000 of the populace,
arrested Hypatius, and had him killed in jail. Justinian restored
his</p>

<p>io6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>dismissed officials, pardoned the conspiring senators, and restored
to the children of Hypatius their confiscated property.’ 1 For the next
thirty years Justinian was secure, but only one person seems to have
loved him.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THEODORA</li>
</ol>
<p>In his book on Buildings Procopius described a statue of Justinian’s
wife: “It is beautiful, but still inferior to the beauty of the Em
press; for to express her loveliness in words, or to portray it as a
statue, would be altogether im- possible for a mere human being.” 7 In
all his writings except one this great - est of Byzantine historians has
nothing but praise for Theodora. But in a book which he left unpublished
during his lifetime, and therefore called Anecdota — “not given out”—
Procopius unfolded so scandalous a tale of the Queen’s premarital life
that its veracity has been debated for thirteen centu - ries. This
“Secret History” is a brief of candid malice, completely one -sided,
devoted to blackening the posthumous reputations of Justinian, Theodora,
and Belisarius. Since Procopius is our chief authority for the period,
and in his other works is apparently accurate and fair, it is impossible
to reject the Anecdota as mere fabrication; we may only rate it the
angry retaliation of a disappointed courtier. John of Ephesus, who knew
the Empress well, and does not otherwise reproach her, calls her simply
“Theodora the strumpet.” 8 For the rest there is scant corroboration of
Procopius’ charges in other con - temporary historians. Many theologians
denounced her heresies, but none of them mentions her depravity — an
incredible generosity if her depravity was real. We may reasonably
conclude that Theodora began as not quite a lady, and ended as every
inch a queen.</p>
<p>She was, Procopius assures us, the daughter of a bear trainer, grew
up in the odor of a circus, became an actress and a prostitute, shocked
and de- lighted Constantinople with her lewd pantomimes, practiced
abortion with repeated success, but gave birth to an illegitimate child;
became the mistress of Hecebolus, a Syrian* was deserted by him, and was
lost sight of for a time in Alexandria. She reappeared in Constantinople
as a poor but honest woman, earning her living by spinning wool.
Justinian fell in love with her, made her his mistress, then his wife,
then his queen. 0 We cannot now determine how much truth there is in
this proemiurri; but if such preliminaries did not dis- turb an emperor,
they should not long detain us. Shortly after their marriage Justinian
was crowned in St. Sophia; Theodora was crowned Empress at his side; and
“not even a priest,” says Procopius, “showed himself outraged.” 10</p>
<p>From whatever she had been, Theodora became a matron whose imperial
chastity no one impugned. She was avid of money and power, she sometimes
gave way to an imperious temper, she occasionally intrigued to achieve
ends opposed to Justinian’s. She slept much, i ndulged heartily in food
and drink,</p>
<p>CHAP, v) JUSTINIAN 107</p>
<p>loved luxury, jewelry, and display, spent many months of the year in
her palaces on’ the shore; nevertheless Justinian remained always
enamored of her, and bore with philosophic patience her interferences
with his schemes. He had invested her uxoriously with a sovereignty
theoretically equal to his own, and could not complain if she exercised
her power. She took an active part in diplomacy and in ecclesiastical
politics, made and unmade Popes and patriarchs, and deposed her enemies.
Sometimes she countermanded her husband’s orders, often to the advantage
of the state ; 11 her intelligence was almost commensurate with her
power. Procopius charges her with cruelty to her opponents, with dungeon
imprisonments and a few murders; men who seriously offended her were
likely to disappear without trace, as in the po- litical morals of our
century. But she knew mercy too. She protected for two years, by hiding
him in her own apartments, the Patriarch Anthemius, who had been exiled
by Justinian for heresy. Perhaps she was too lenient with the adulteries
of Belisarius’ wife; but to balance this she built a pretty “Convent of
Repentance” for reformed prostitutes. Some of the girls repented of t
heir repentance, and threw themselves from the windows, literally bored
to death . 12 She took a grandmotherly interest in the marriages of her
friends, arranged many matches, and sometimes made marriage a condition
of ad- vancement at her court. As might have been expected, she became
in old age a stem guardian of public morals . 13</p>
<p>Finally she interested herself in theology, and debated with her
husband the nature of Christ. Justinian labored to reunite the Eastern
and the Western Church; unity of religion, he thought, was indispensable
to the unity of the Empire. But Theodora could not understand the two
natures in Christ, though she raised no difficulties about the three
persons in God; she adopted the Monophysite doctrine, perceived that on
this point the East would not yield to the West, and judged that the
strength and fortune of the Empire lay in the rich provinces of Asia,
Syria, and Egypt, rather than in Western provinces ruined by barbarism
and war. She softened Justinian’s orthodox intolerance, protected
heretics, challenged the papacy, secretly encouraged the rise of an
independent Monophysite Church in the East; and on these issues she
fought tenaciously and ruthlessly against emperor and pope.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>BELISARIUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Justinian can be forgiven his passion for unity; it is the eternal
temptation of philosophers as well as of statesmen, and generalizations
have sometimes cost more than war. To recapture Africa from the Vandals,
Italy from the Ostrogoths, Spain from the Visigoths, Gaul from the
Franks, Britain from the Saxons; to drive barbarism back to its lairs
and restore Roman civilization to all its old expanse; to spread Roman
law once more across the white man’s</p>
<p>io8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>world from the Euphra tes to Hadrian’s Wall: these were no ignoble
ambi - tions, though they were destined to exhaust saviors and saved
alike. For these high purposes Justinian ended the schism of the Eastern
from the Western Church on papal terms, and dreamed of bringing Arians,
Monophysites, and other heretics into one great spiritual fold. Not
since Constantine had a European thought in such dimensions.</p>
<p>Justinian was favored with competent generals, and harassed by
limited means. His people were unwilling to fight his Avars, and unable
to pay for them. He soon used up the 320,000 pounds of gold that
Justin’s predecessors had left in the treasury; thereafter he was forced
to taxes that alienated the citizens, and economies that hampered his
generals. Universal military service had ceased a century before; now
the imperial army was composed almost wholly of barbarian mercenaries
from a hundred tribes and states. They lived by plunder, and dreamed of
riches and rape; time and again they mutinied in the crisis of battle,
or lost a victory by stopping to gather spoils. Nothing united or
inspired them except regular pay and able generals.</p>
<p>Belisarius, like Justinian, came of Illyrian peasant stock, recalling
those Balkan emperors — Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian — who had saved the
Empire in the third century. No general since Caesar ever won so many
victories with such limited resources of men and funds; few ever
surpassed him in strategy or tactics, in popularity with his men and
mercy to his foes; perhaps it merits note that the greatest generals —
Alexander, Caesar, Belisarius, Sala- din, Napoleon — found clemency a
mighty engine of war. There was a strain of sensitivity and tenderness
in Belisarius, as in those others, which could turn the soldier into a
lover as soon as his bloody tasks were done. And as the Emperor doted on
Theodora, so Belisarius adored Antonina, bore with melting fury her
infidelities, and, for divers reasons, took her with him on his
campaigns.</p>
<p>He won his first honors in war against Persia. After 150 years of
peace between the empires, hostilities had been renewed in the old
competition for control of the trade routes to Central Asia and India.
Amid brilliant victories Belisarius was suddenly recalled to
Constantinople; Justinian made peace with Persia (532) by paying Khosru
Anushirvan 1 1,000 pounds of gold; and then sent Belisarius to win back
Africa. He had concluded that he could never expect to make permanent
conquests in the East: the population there would be hostile, the
frontier difficult to defend. But in the West were na- tions accustomed
for centuries to Roman rule, resenting their heretical bar- barian
masters, and promising co-operation in war as well as taxes in peace.
And from Africa added grain would come to quiet the critical mouths of
the capital.</p>
<p>Gaiseric had died (477) after a reign of thirty-nine years. Under his
suc- cessors Vandal Africa had resumed most of its Roman ways. Latin was
the</p>
<p>CHAP. V) JUSTINIAN IO9</p>
<p>official language, and poets wrote in it dead verse to honor
forgotten kings. The Roman theater at Carthage was restored, Greek
dramas were played again. 14 The monuments of ancient art were
respected, and splendid new buildings rose. Procopius pictures the
ruling classes as civilized gentlemen touched with occasional barbarism,
but mostly neglecting the arts of war, and decaying leisurely under the
sun. 15</p>
<p>In June, 533, five hundred transports and ninety-two warships
gathered in the Bosporus, received the commands of the Emperor and the
blessings of the patriarch, and sailed for Carthage. Procopius was on
Belisarius’ staff, and wrote a vivid, account of the “Vandal War.”
Landing in Africa with only 5000 cavalry, Belisarius swept through the
improvised defenses of Car- thage, and in a few months overthrew the
Vandal power. Justinian too hastily recalled him for a triumph at
Constantinople; the Moors, pouring down from the hills, attacked the
Roman garrison; Belisarius hurried back just in time to quell a mutiny
among the troops and lead them to victory. Carthaginian Africa
thenceforth remained under Byzantine rule till the Arabs came.</p>
<p>Justinian’s crafty diplomacy had arranged an alliance with the
Ostrogoths while Belisarius attacked Africa; now he lured the Franks
into an alliance while he ordered Belisarius to conquer Ostrogothic
Italy. Using Tunisia as a base, Belisarius without much difficulty took
Sicily. In 536 he crossed to Italy, and captured Naples by having some
of his soldiers creep through the aqueduct into the town. The
Ostrogothic forces were meager and divided; the people of Rome hailed
Belisarius as a liberator, the clergy welcomed him as a Trinitarian; he
entered Rome unopposed. Theodahad had Amalasuntha killed; the Ostrogoths
deposed Theodahad, and chose Witigis as king. Witi- gis raised an army
of 150,000 men, and besieged Belisarius in Rome. Forced to economize
food and water, and to discontinue their daily baths, the Ro- mans began
to grumble against Belisarius, who had only 5000 men in arms. He defende
d the city with skill and courage, and after a year’s effort Witigis
returned to Ravenna. For three years Belisarius importuned Justinian for
additional troops; they were sent, but under generals hostile to
Belisarius. The Ostrogoths in Ravenna, besieged and starving, offered to
surrender if Belisarius would become their king. He pretended to
consent, took the city, and presented it to Justinian (540) .</p>
<p>The Emperor was grateful and suspicious. Belisarius had rewarded
himself well out of the spoils of victory; he had won the too-personal
loyalty of his troops; he had been offered a kingdom; might he not
aspire to seize the throne from the nephew of a usurper? Justinian
recalled him, and noticed uneasily the splendor of the general’s
retinue. The By zantines, Procopius reports, “took delight in watching
Belisarius as he came forth from his home each day. … For his progress
resembled a crowded festival procession, since he was always escorted by
a large number of Vandals, Goths, and Moors. Further-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>more, lie had a fine figure, and was tall and remarkably handsome.
But his conduct was so meek, and his manners so affable, that he seemed
like a very poor man, and one of no repute.” 10</p>
<p>The commanders appointed to replace him in Italy neglected the
discipline of their troops, quarreled with one another, and earned the
contempt of the Ostrogoths. A Goth of energy, judgment, and courage was
proclaimed king of the defeated people. Totila gathered desperate
recruits from the barbari- ans wandering homeless in Italy, took Naples
( 543 ) and Tibur, and laid siege to Rome. He astonished all by his
clemency and good faith; treated captives so well that they enlisted
under his banner; kept so honorably the promises by which he had secured
the surrender of Naples that men began to wonder who was the barbarian,
and who the civilized Greek. The wives of some senators fell into his
hands; he treated them with gallant courtesy, and set them free. He
condemned one of his soldiers to death for violating a Roman girl. 1 l
he barbarians in the Emperor’s service showed no such delicacy; un -
paid by the nearly bankrupt Justinian, they ravaged the country till the
population remembered with longing the order and justi ce of Theodoric’s
rule. 17</p>
<p>Belisarius was ordered to the rescue. Reaching Italy, he made his way
alone through Totila’s lines into beleaguered Rome. He was too late; the
Greek garrison was demoralized; its officers were incompetent cowards;
traitors opened the gates, and Totila’s army, ten thousand strong,
entered the capital (546). Belisarius, retreating, sent a message asking
him not to destroy the historic city; Totila permitted plunder to his
unpaid and hungry troops, but spared the people, and protected the women
from soldierly ardor. He made the mistake of leaving Rome to besiege)
Ravenna; in his absence Belisarius recaptured the city; and when Totila
returned, his second siege failed to dis- lodge the resourceful Greek.
Justinian, thinking the West won, -declared war on Persia, and called
Belisarius to the East. Totila took Rome again (549), and Sicily,
Corsica, Sardinia, almost the entire peninsula. At last Justinian gave
to his eunuch general Narses “an exceedingly large sum of money,” and
ordered him to raise a new army and drive the Goths from Italy. Narses
accomplished his mission with skill and dispatch; Totila was defeated
and was killed in flight; the surviving Goths were permitted to leave
Italy safely, and after eighteen yea rs the “Gothic War” came to an end
(553).</p>
<p>Those years completed the ruin of Italy. Rome had been five times
cap- tured, thrice besieged, starved, looted; its population, once a
million, was now reduced to 4o,ooo, ls of whom nearly half were paupers
maintained by papal alms. Milan had been destroyed, and all its
inhabitants killed. Hundreds of towns and villages sank into insolvency
under the exactions of rulers and the depredations of troops. Regions
once tilled were abandoned, and the food supply fell; in Picenum alone,
we are told, 50,000 died of starvation during these eighteen years. 10
The aristocracy was shattered; so many of its</p>

<p>members had been slain in battle, pillage, or flight that too few
survived to continue the Senate of Rome; after 579 we hear of it no
more. 20 The great aqueducts that Theodoric had repaired were broken and
neglected, and again turned the Campagna into a vast malarial marsh,
which remained till our time. The majestic baths, dependent upon the
aqueducts, fell into disuse and decay. Hundreds of statues, surviving
Alaric and Gaiseric, had been broken or melted down to provide
projectiles and machines during siege. Only ruins bore witness to Rome’s
ancient grandeur as capital of half the world. The Eastern emperor would
now for a brief period rule Italy; but it was a costly and empty
victory. Rome would not fully recover from that victory till the
Renaissance.</p>

<li>THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN</li>
</ol>
<p>History rightly forgets Justinian’s wars, and remembers him for his
laws. A century had elapsed since the publication of Theodosius’ Code;
many of its regulations had been made obsolete by changing conditions;
many new laws had been passed which lay in confusion on the statute
books; and many contradictions in the laws hampered executives and
courts. The influence of Christianity had modified legislation and
interpretation. The civil laws of Rome often conflicted with the laws of
the nations composing the Empire; many of the old enactments were ill
adapted to the Hellenistic traditions of the East. The whole vast body
of Roman law had become an empirical accu- mulation rather than a
logical code.</p>
<p>Justinian’s unifying passion resented this chaos, as it chafed at the
dis - memberment of the Empire. In 528 he appointed ten jurists to
systematize, clarify, and reform the laws. The most active and
influential member of this commission was the quaestor Tribonian, who,
despite venality and suspected atheism, remained to his death the chief
inspirer, adviser, and executant of Justinian’s legislative plans. The
first part of the task was accomplished with</p>
<p>To the youth desirous of studying the law: The Imperial Majesty</p>
<p>should be armed with law as well as glorified with arms, that
there</p>
<p>may be good government in times both of war and of peace; and</p>
<p>that the ruler may . . . show himself as scrupulously regardful of
jus- tice as triumphant over his foes. 21</p>
<p>The commissioners then proceeded to the second part of their
assignment: to gather into a system those responsa or opinions of the
great Roman jurists which still seemed worthy to have the force of law.
The result was published as the Digesta or Pandectae (533) ; the
opinions quoted, and the interpreta-</p>
<p>1 1 2 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. V</p>
<p>tions now given, were henceforth to be binding upon all judges; and
all other opinions lost legal authority. Older collections of responsa
ceased to be copied, and for the most part disappeared. What remains of
them suggests that Justinian’s redactors omitted opinions favorable to f
reedom, and by im- pious fraud transformed some judgments of ancient
jurists to better conso- nance with absolute rule.</p>
<p>While this major work was in process, Tribonian and two associates,
find- ing the Codex too laborious a volume for students, issued an
official handbook of civil law under the title of lnstitutiones (533).
Essentially this reproduced, amended, and brought up to date the
Commentaries of Gaius, who in the second century had with admirable
skill and clarity summarized the civil law of his time. Meanwhile
Justinian had been issuing new laws. In 5 34 Tribonian and four aides
embodied these in a revised edition of the Codex-, the earlier issue was
deprived of authority, and was lost to history. After Justinian’s death
his additional legislation was published as Novellae (sc. constimtiones
) — i.e., new enactments. Whereas the previous publications had been in
Latin, this was in Greek, and marked the end of Latin as the language of
the law in the Byzantine Empire. All these publications came to be known
as the Corpus iuris civilis , or Body of Civil Law, and were loosely
referred to as the Code of Justinian.</p>
<p>This Code, like the Theodosian, enacted orthodox Christianity into
law. It began by declaring for the Trinity, and anathematized Nestorius,
Eutyches, and Apollinaris. It acknowledged the ecclesiastical leadership
of the Roman Church, and ordered all Christian groups to submit to her
authority. But en- suing chapters proclaimed the dominion of the emperor
over the Church: all ecclesiastical, like all civil, law, was to emanate
from the throne. The Code pro- ceeded to make laws for metropolitans,
bishops, abbots, and monks, and speci- fied penalties for clerics who
gambled, or attended the theater or the games . 22 Manicheans or
relapsed heretics were to be put to death; Donatists, Montanists,
Monophysites, and other dissenters were to suffer confiscation of their
goods, and were declared incompetent to buy or sell, to inherit or
bequeath; they were excluded from public office, forbidden to meet, and
disqualified from suing orthodox Christians for debt. A gentler
enactment empowered bishops to visit prisons, and to protect prisoners
from abuses of the law.</p>
<p>The Code replaced older distinctions of class. Freedmen were no
longer treated as a separate group; they enjoyed at once, on their
emancipation, all the privi- leges of freemen; they might rise to be
senators or emperors. All freemen were divided into honestiores — men of
honor or rank — and Immiliores — com- moners. A hierarchy of rank, which
had developed among the honestiores since Diocletian, was sanctioned by
the Code: patricii, illustres, spectabiles (hence our respectable),
Claris simi, and gloriosv, there were many Oriental elements in this
Roman law.</p>
<p>The Code showed some Christian or Stoic influence in its legislation
on slavery. The rape, of a slave woman, as of a free woman, was to be
punished with death.</p>
<p>CHAP, v) JUSTINIAN 1 1 3</p>
<p>A slave might marry a free woman if his master consented. Justinian,
like th&amp; Church, encouraged manumissions; but his law allowed a
newborn child to bt sold into slavery if its parents were desperate with
poverty . 23 Certain passages of the Code legalized serfdom, and
prepared for feudalism. A freeman who had cultivated a tract of land for
thirty years was required, with his descendants, to remain forever
attached to that piece of land ; 24 the measure was explained as
discouraging the desertion of the soil. A serf who ran away, or became a
cleric without his lor d’s consent, could be reclaimed like a runaway
slave.</p>
<p>The status of woman was moderately improved by the Code. Her
subjection to lifelong guardianship had been ended in the fourth
century, and the old prin- ciple that inheritance could pass only
through males had become obsolete; the Church, which often received
legacies from women, did much to secure these reforms. Justinian sought
to enforce the views of the Church on divorce, and forbade it except
when one of the parties wished to enter a convent or monastery. But this
was too extreme a departure from existing custom and law; large sec-
tions of the public protested that it would increase the number of
poisonings. The later legislation of the Emperor listed a generous
variety of grounds for divorce; and this, with some interruptions,
remained the law of the Byzantine Empire till 145 3. 25 Penalties
imposed by Augustus upon celibacy and childless - ness were removed in
the Code. Constantine had made adultery a capital crime, though he had
rarely enforced the decree; Justinian kept the death penalty for men,
but reduced the penalty for the woman to immurement in a nunnery. A
husband might with impunity kill the paramour of his wife if, after
sending her three witnessed warnings, he found her in his own house, or
in a tavern, con- versing with the suspected man. Similarly severe
penalties were decreed for in- tercourse with an unmarried woman or a
widow, unless she was a concubine or a prostitute. Rape was punished
with death and confiscation of property, and the proceeds were given to
the injured woman. Justinian not only decreed death for homosexual acts,
but often added torture, mutilation, and the public parading of the
guilty persons before their execution. In this extreme legislation
against sexual irregularities we feel the influence of a Christianity
shocked into a ferocious puritanism by the sins of pagan
civilization.</p>
<p>Justinian made a decisive change in the law of property. The ancient
privi- lege of agnate relatives — relatives through the male line — to
inherit an intestate property was abolished; such inheritance was now to
descend to the cognate relatives in direct line — children,
grandchildren, etc. Charitable gifts and be- quests were encouraged by
the Code. The property of the Church, whether in realty or movables,
rents, serfs, or slaves, was declared inalienable; no member, and no
number of members, of the clergy or the laity could give, sell, or
bequeath anything belonging to the Church. These laws of Leo I and
Anthemius, confirmed by the Code, became the legal basis of the Church’s
growing wealth: secular prop - erty was dissipated, ecclesiastical
property was accumulated, in the course of generations. The Church
tried, and failed, to have interest forbidden. Default- ing debtors
could be arrested, but were to be released on bail or on their oath to
return for trial.</p>
<p>No one could be imprisoned except by order of a high magistrate; and
there</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>1 1 4</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>were strict limits to the time that might elapse between arrest and
trial. Lawyers were so numerous that Justinian built for them a basilica
whose size may be judged from its library of 150,000 volumes or rolls.
Trial was to be held be- fore a magistrate appointed by the emperor; but
if both parties so wished, the case could be transferred to the bishop’s
court. A copy of the Bible was placed before the judge in each trial;
the attorneys were required to swear on it that they would do their best
to defend their clients honorably, but would resign their case if they
found it dishonest; plaintiff and defendant had also to swear on it to
the justice of their cause. Penalties, though severe, were seldom
mandatory; the judge might mitigate them for women, minors, and drunken
offenders. Imprisonment was used as detention for trial, but seldom as a
punish- ment. The Justinian Code retrogressed from the laws of Hadrian
and Antoninus Pius by permitting mutilation as a penalty. Tax collectors
falsifying returns, and persons copying Monophysite literature, could
suffer the loss of a hand, on the theory that the offending member
should pay for the crime. Amputation of nose or throat is frequently
decreed in the Code; later Byzantine law added blinding, especially as a
means for disqualifying heirs or aspirants to the throne. The death
penalty was carried out on free persons by beheading, on some slaves by
crucifixion. Sorcerers and deserters from the army were burned alive. A
con- demned citizen might appeal to a higher court, then to the Senate,
finally to the emperor.</p>
<p>We can admire the Code of Justinian more readily as a whole than in
its parts. It differs most from earlier codes by its rigid orthodoxy,
its deeper obscurantism, its vengeful severity. An educated Roman would
have found life more civilized under the Antonines than under Justinian.
The Emperor could not escape his environment and his time; and in his
ambition to unify everything he codified the superstition and barbarity,
as well as the justice and charity, of his age. The Code was
conservative, like everything Byzan- tine, and served as a strait jacket
for a civilization that seemed destined never to die. It soon ceased to
be obeyed except in a narrowing realm. The Eastern nationalist heretics
whom it flayed opened .their arms to the Moslems, and prospered better
under the Koran than under the Code. Italy under the Lom- bards, Gaul
under the Franks, England under the Anglo-Saxons, Spain under the
Visigoths, ignored the edicts of Justinian. Nevertheless the Code for
some generations gave order and security to a motley assemblage of
peoples, and allowed, across the frontiers and along the streets of a
dozen nations, freer and safer movement than the same regions enjoy
today. It continued to the end the code of the Byzantine Empire; and
five centuries after it disap- peared in the West it was revived by the
jurists of Bologna, accepted by em- perors and popes, and entered like a
scaffolding of order into the structure of many modern states.</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>JUSTINIAN</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>V. THE IMPERIAL THEOLOGIAN</p>
<p>It remained only to unify belief, to weld the Church into a
homogeneous instrument of rule. Probably Justinian’s piety was sincere,
not merely politi - cal; he himself, as far as Theodora would permit,
lived like a monk in his pal- ace, fasting and praying, poring over
theological tomes, and debating doctrinal niceties with professors,
patriarchs, and popes. Procopius, with transparent concurrence, quotes a
conspirator: “It ill becomes anyone who has even a little spirit in him
to refuse to murder Justinian; nor should he entertain any fear of a man
who always sits unguarded in some lobby to a late hour of the night,
eagerly unrolling the Christian Scriptures in company with priests who
are at the extremity of old age.” 26 Almost the first use that Justinian
had made of his power as regent for Justin was to end the breach that
had been widened between the Eastern and the Western Church by the
Emperor Zeno’s Henoticon. By accepting the viewpo int of the papacy,
Jus- tinian won the support of the orthodox clergy in Italy against the
Goths, and in the East against the Monophysites.</p>
<p>This sect, arguing passionately that there was but one nature in
Christ, had become almost as numerous in Egypt as the Catholics. In
Alexandria they were so advanced that they in turn could divide into
orthodox and heterodox Monophysites; these factions fought in the
streets, while their women joined in with missiles from the roofs. When
the armed forces of the Emperor in- stalled a Catholic bishop in the see
of Athanasius, the congregation greeted his first sermon with a volley
of stones, and was slaughtered in situ by the imperial soldiery. While
Catholicism controlled the Alexandrian episcopacy, heresy spread
throughout the countryside; the peasants ignored the decrees of the
patriarch and the orders of the Emperor, and Egypt was half lost to the
Empire a century before the Arabs came.</p>
<p>In this matter, as in many others, the persistent Theodora overcame
the vacillating Justinian. She intrigued with Vigilius, a Roman deacon,
to make him pope if he would offer concessions to the Monophysites. Pope
Silverius was removed from Rome by Belisarius (537), and was exiled to
the island of Palmaria, where he soon died from harsh treatment; and
Vigilius was made Pope by the orders of the Emperor. Finally accepting
Theodora’s view that Monophysitism could not be crushed, Justinian
sought to appease its fol- lowers in a document of imperial theology
known as the Three Chapters. He summoned Vigilius to Constantinople, and
urged him to subscribe to this statement. Vigilius reluctantly
consented, whereupon the African Catholic clergy excommunicated him
(550); he withdrew his consent, was exiled by Justinian to a rock in the
Proconnesus, again consented, obtained leave to return to Rome, but died
on the way(555). Never had an emperor made so open an attempt to
dominate the papacy. Justinian called an ecumenical</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>1 1 6</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>council to meet at Constantinople (553); hardly any Western bishops
at- tended; the council approved Justinian’s formulas, the Western
Church re - jected them, and Eastern and Western Christianity resumed
their schism for a century.</p>
<p>In the end death won all a rguments. Theodora’s passing in 548 was to
Jus - tinian the heaviest of many blows that broke down his courage,
clarity, and strength. He was then sixty-five, weakened by asceticism
and recurrent crises; he left the government to subordinates, neglected
the defenses he had so labored to build, and abandoned himself to
theology. A hundred disasters darkened the remaining seventeen years
during which he outlived himself. Earthquakes were especially frequent
in this reign; a dozen cities were almost wiped out by them; and their
rehabilitation drained the Treasury. In 542 plague came; in 55 6 famine,
in 558 plague again. In 559 the Kotrigur Huns crossed the Danube,
plundered Moesia and Thrace, took thousands of cap- tives, violated
matrons, virgins, and nuns, threw to the dogs the infants born to women
captives on the march, and advanced to the walls of Constanti- nople.
The terrified Emperor appealed to the great general who had so often
saved him. Belisarius was old and feeble; nevertheless he put on his
armor, gathered 300 veterans who had fought with him in Italy, recruited
a few hun- dred untrained men, and went out to meet 7000 Huns. He
disposed his forces with his wonted foresight and skill, concealing 200
of his best soldiers in ad- joining woods. When the Huns moved forward
these men fell upon their flank, while Belisarius met the attack at the
head of his little army. The bar- barians turned and fled before a
single Roman was mortally injured. The populace at the capital
complained that Belisarius had not pursued the enemy and brought back
the Hun leader as captive. The jealous Emperor listened to envious
calumnies against his general, suspected him of conspiracy, and or-
dered him to dismiss his armed retainers. Belisarius died in 565, and
Justinian confiscated half his property.</p>
<p>The Emperor outlived the general by eight months. In his final years
his interest in theology had borne strange fruit: the defender of the
faith had become a heretic. He announced that the body of Christ was
incorruptible, and that Christ’s human nature had never been subject to
any of the wants and indignities of mortal flesh. The clergy warned him
that if he died in this error his soul would “be delivered to the
flames, and bum there eter - nally.” 2 7 He died unrepentant (565),
after a life of eighty-three years, and a reign of thirty-eight.</p>
<p>Justinian’s death was one more point at which antiquity might be said
to end. He was a true Roman emperor, thinking in terms of all the Empire
East and West, struggling to keep back the barbarians, and to bring
again to the vast realm an orderly government of homogeneous laws. He
had accom- plished a good measure of this aim: Africa, Dalmatia, Italy,
Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and part of Spain had been regained; the
Persians had been driven out</p>
<p>CHAP, v) JUSTINIAN 117</p>
<p>of Syria; the Empire had doubled its extent in his reign. Though his
legisla- tion was barbarously severe on heresy and sexual immorality, it
represented, by its unity, lucidity, and scope, one of the peaks in the
history of law. His administration was sullied with official corruption,
extreme taxation, capri- cious pardons and punishments; but it was also
distinguished by a painstaking organization of imperial economy and
government; and it created a system of order which, though a stranger to
freedom, held civilization together in a corner of Europe while the rest
of the continent plunged into the Dark Ages. He left his name upon the
history of industry and art; St. Sophia is also his monument. To
orthodox contemporaries it must have seemed that once more the Empire
had turned back the tide, and won a respite from death.</p>
<p>It was a pitifully brief respite. Justinian had left the treasury
empty, as he had found it full; his intolerant laws and thieving
taxgatherers had alienated nations as fast as his armies had conquered
them; and those armies, decimated, scattered, and ill paid, could not
long defend what they had so devastatingly won. Africa was soon
abandoned to the Berbers; Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Africa, and Spain to
the Arabs; Italy to the Lombards; within a century after Justinian’s
death the Empire had lost more territory than he had gained. With proud
hindsight we may see how much better it would have been to gather the
rising nationalities and creeds into a federated union; to offer
friendship to the Ostrogoths who had governed Italy comparatively well;
and to serve as a protective medium through which the ancient culture
might flow unstinted to the newborn states.</p>
<p>We need not accept Procopius’ estimate of Justinian; it was refuted
by Procopius himself . 28 He was a great ruler, whose very faults sprang
from the logic and sincerity of his creed: his persecutions from his
certainty, his wars from his Roman spirit, his confiscations from his
wars. We mourn the nar- row violence of his methods, and applaud the
grandeur of his aims. He and Belisarius, not Boniface and Aetius, were
the last of the Romans.</p>
