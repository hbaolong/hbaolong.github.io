<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>Julian the Apostate</p>
<p>332-63</p>
<p>I. THE LEGACY OF CONSTANTINE</p>
<p>I N the year 335 the Emperor Constantine, feeling the nearness of
death, called his sons and nephews to his side, and divided among them,
with the folly of fondness, the government of the immense Empire that he
had won. To his eldest son, Constantine II, he assigned the West —
Britain, Gaul, and Spain; to his son Constantius, the East — Asia Minor,
Syria, and Egypt; to his youngest son, Constans, North Africa, Italy,
Illyricum, and Thrace, includ- ing the new and old capitals —
Constantinople and Rome; and to two nephews Armenia, Macedonia, and
Greece. The first Christian Emperor had spent his life, and many
another, in restoring the monarchy, and unifying the faith, of the Roman
Empire; his death (337) risked all. He had a hard choice: his rule had
not acquired the sanctity of time, and could not ensure the peaceable
succession of a sole heir; divided government seemed a lesser evil than
civil war.</p>
<p>Civil war came none the less, and assassination simplified the scene.
The army rejected the authority of any but Constantine’s sons; all other
male relatives of the dead Emperor were murdered, except his nephews
Gallus and Julian; Gallus was ill, and gave promise of an early death;
Julian was five, and perhaps the charm of his age softened the heart of
Constantius, whom tradition and Ammianus credited with these crimes. 1
Constantius re- newed with Persia that ancient war between East and West
which had never really ceased since Marathon, and allowed his brothers
to eliminate one an- other in fraternal strife. Left sole Emperor (353),
he returned to Constanti- nople, and governed the reunified realm with
dour integrity and devoted incompetence, too suspicious to be happy, too
cruel to be loved, too vain to be great.</p>
<p>The city that Constantine had called Nova Roma, but which even in his
lifetime had taken his name, had been founded on the Bosporus by Greek
colonists about 657 b.c. For almost a thousand years it had been known
as Byzantium; and Byzantine would persist as a label for its
civilization and its art. No site on earth could have surpassed it for a
capital; at Tilsit, in 1807, Napoleon would call it the empire of the
world, and would refuse to yield it to a Russia fated by the direction
of her rivers to long for its control. Here</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>at any moment the ruling power could close a main door between East
and West; here the commerce of continents would congregate, and deposit
the products of a hundred states; here an army might stand poised to
drive back the gentlemen of Persia, the Huns of the East, the Slavs of
the North, and the barbarians of the West. The rushing waters provided
defense on every side but one, which could be strongly walled; and in
the Golden Horn — a quiet inlet of the Bosporus — war fleets and
merchantmen might find a haven from attack or storm. The Greeks called
the inlet Keras, horn , possibly from its shape; golden was later added
to suggest the wealth brought to this port in fish and grain and trade.
Here, amid a population predominantly Christian, and long inured to
Oriental monarchy and pomp, the Christian emperor migh t enjoy the
public support withheld by Rome’s proud Senate</p>
<p>In November 324 Constantine the Great led his aides, engineers, and
priests from the harbor of Byzantium across the surrounding hills to
trace the boundaries of his contemplated capital. Some marveled that he
took in so much, but “I shall advance,” he said, “till He, the invisible
God who marches before me, thinks proper to stop.” 2 He left no deed
undone, no word unsaid, that could give to his plan, as to his state, a
deep support in the religious sentiments of the people and in the
loyalty of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>“In obedience to the command of God,” 3 he brought in thousands of
workmen and artists to raise city walls, fortifications, administrative
build- ings, palaces, and homes; he adorned the squares and streets with
fountains and porticoes, and with famous sculptures conscripted
impartially from a hundred cities in his realm; and to divert the
turbulence of the populace he provided an ornate and spacious hippodrome
where the public passion for games and gambling might vent itself on a
scale paralleled only in degenerat- ing Rome. The New Rome was dedicated
as capital of the Eastern Empire on May 11, 330 — a day that was
thereafter annually celebrated with im- posing ceremony. Paganism was
officially ended; the Middle Ages of tri- umphant faith were, so to
speak, officially begun. The East had won its spiritual battle against
the physically victorious West, and would rule the Western soul for a
thousand years.</p>
<p>Within two centuries of its establishment as a capital,
Constantinople be-</p>
<p>CHAP, i) JULIAN THE APOSTATE 5</p>
<p>came, and for ten centuries remained, the richest, most beautiful,
and most civilized city in the world. In 337 it contained some 50,000
people; in 400 some 100,000; in 500 almost a million. 4 An official
document ( c . 450) lists five imperial palaces, six palaces for the
ladies of the court, three for high dig- nitaries, 4388 mansions, 322
streets, 52 porticoes; add to these a thousand shops, a hundred places
of amusement, sumptuous baths, brilliantly orna- mented churches, and
magnificent squares that were veritable museums of the art of the
classic world. 5 On the second of the hills that lifted the city above
its encompassing waters lay the Forum of Constantine, an elliptical
space entered under a triumphal arch at either end; porticoes and
statuary formed its circumference; on the north side stood a stately
senate house; at the center rose a famous porphyry pillar, 1 20 feet
high, crowned with the figure of Apollo, and ascribed to Pheidias
himself.*</p>
<p>From the Forum a broad Mese or Middle Way, lined with palaces and
shops, and shaded with colonnades, led westward through the city to the
Augusteum, a plaza a thousand by three hundred feet, named after
Constan- tine’s mother Helena as Augusta. At the north end of this
square rose the first form of St. Sophia — Church of the Holy Wisdom; on
the east side was a sec- ond senate chamber; on the south stood the main
palace of the emperor, and the gigantic public Baths of Zeuxippus,
containing hundreds of statues in marble or bronze; at the west end a
vaulted monument — the Milion or Mile- stone-marked the point from which
radiated the many magnificent roads (some still functioning) that bound
the provinces to the capital. Here, too, on the west of the Augusteum,
lay the great Hippodrome. Between this and St. Sophia the imperial or
Sacred Palace spread, a complex structure of mar- ble surrounded by 150
acres of gardens and porticoes. Here and there and in the suburbs were
the mansions of the aristocracy. In the narrow, crooked, congested side
streets were the shops of the tradesmen, and the homes or tenements of
the populace. At its western terminus the Middle Way opened through the
“Golden Gate”— in the Wall of Constantine — upon the Sea of Marmora.
Palaces lined the three shores, and trembled with reflected glory in the
waves.</p>
<p>The population of the city was mainly Roman at the top, and for the
rest overwhelmingly Greek. All alike called themselves Roman. While the
lan- guage of the state was Latin, Greek remained the speech of the
people, and, by the seventh century, displaced Latin even in government.
Below the great officials and the senators was an aristocracy of
landowners dwelling now in the city, now on their country estates.
Scorned by these, but rivaling them in wealth, were the merchants who
exchanged the goods of Constantinople and its hinterland for those of
the world; below these, a swelling bureaucracy of governmental
employees; below these the shopkeepers and master work-</p>
<p>Blackened with time and fire, it is now known as the Burnt
Pillar.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>men of a hundred trades; below these a mass of formally free labor,
voteless and riotous, normally disciplined by hunger and police, and
bribed to peace by races, games, and a daily dole totaling 80,000
measures of grain or loaves of bread. At the bottom, as everywhere in
the Empire, were slaves, less nu- merous than in Caesar’s Rome, and more
humanely treated through the leg - islation of Constantine and the
mitigating influence of the Church. 6</p>
<p>Periodically the free population rose from its toil to crowd the
Hippo- drome. There, in an amphitheater 560 feet long and 380 wide,
seats accommodated from 30,000 to 70,000 spectators; 7 these were
protected from the arena by an elliptical moat; and between the games
they might walk under a shaded and marble-railed promenade 27 66 feet
long. 8 Statuary lined the spina or backbone of the course — a low wall
that ran along the middle length of the arena from goal to goal. At the
center of the spina stood an obelisk of Thothmes III, brought from
Egypt; to the south rose a pillar of three intertwined bronze serpents,
originally raised at Delphi to commemo- rate the victory of Plataea (479
b.c.) ; these two monuments still stand. The emperor’s box, the
Kathisma, was adorned in the fifth century with four horses in gilded
bronze, an ancient work of Lysippus. In this Hippodrome the great
national festivals were celebrated with processions, athletic contests,
acrobatics, animal hunts and fights, and exhibitions of exotic beasts
and birds. Greek tradition and Christian sentiment combined to make the
amusements of Constantinople less cruel than those of Rome; we hear of
no gladiatorial combats in the new capital. Nevertheless, the
twenty-four horse and chariot races that usually dominated the program
provided all the excitement that had marked a Roman holiday. Jockeys and
charioteers were divided into Blues, Greens, Reds, and Whites, according
to their employers and their garb; the spectators — and indeed the whole
population of the city — divided likewise; and the principal fashions —
the Blues and Greens — fought with throats in the Hippodrome and
occasionally with knives in the streets. Only at the games could the
populace voice its feelings; there it claimed the right to ask favors of
the ruler, to demand reforms, to denounce oppressive offi- cials,
sometimes to berate the emperor himself as he sat secure in his exalted
seat, from which he had a guarded exit to his palace.</p>
<p>Otherwise the populace was politically impotent. The Constantinian
Constitution, continuing Diocletian’s, was frankly monarchical. The

Diocletian and Constantine concluded that order could be restored only
by restricting higher offices to an aristocracy of patrician counts (
comites ) and dukes {duces), recruited not by birth but through
appointment by an emperor who possessed full responsibility and power,
and was clothed with all the awesome prestige of ceremonial
inaccessibility, Oriental pomp, and ecclesi- astical coronation,
sanctification, and support. Perhaps the system was war- ranted by the
situation; but it left no check upon the ruler except the advice of
complaisant aides and the fear of sudden death. It created a remarkably
efficient administrative and judicial organization, and kept the
Byzantine Empire in existence for a millennium; but at the cost of
political stagnation, public atrophy, court conspiracies, eunuch
intrigues, wars of succession, and a score of palace revolutions that
gave the throne occasionally to compe- tence, seldom to integrity, too
often to an unscrupulous adventurer, an oli- garchic cabal, or an
imperial fool.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CHRISTIANS AND PAGANS</li>
</ol>
<p>In this Mediterranean world of the fourth century, where the state
de- pended so much on religion, ecclesiastical affairs were in such
turmoil that government felt called upon to interfere even in the
mysteries of theology. The great debate between Athanasius and Arius had
not ended with the Council of Nicaea (325). Many bishops — in the East a
majority 9 — still openly or secretly sided with Arius; i.e., they
considered Christ the Son of God, but neither consubstantial nor
coetemal with the Father. Constantine himself, after accepting the
Council’s decree, and banishing Arius, inv ited him to a personal
conference (331)1 could find no heresy in him, and recom- mended the
restoration of Arius and the Arians to their churches, Atha- nasius
protested; a council of Eastern bishops at Tyre deposed him from his
Alexandrian see (335); and for two years he lived as an exile in Gaul.
Arius again visited Constantine, and professed adherence to the Nicene
Creed, with subtle reservations that an emperor could not be expected to
under- stand. Constantine believed him, and bade Alexander, Patriarch of
Constanti- nople, receive him into communion. The ecclesiastical
historian Socrates here tells a painful tale:</p>
<p>It was then Saturday, and Arius was expecting to assemble with
the</p>
<p>congregation on the day following; but Divine retribution over-</p>
<p>took his daring criminality. For going out from the imperial
palace</p>
<p>. . . and approaching the porphyry pillar in the Forum of
Constan-</p>
<p>tine, a terror seized him, accompanied by violent relaxation of
his</p>
<p>bowels. . . . Together with the evacuations his bowels protruded,
fol- lowed by a copious hemorrhage, and the descent of the smaller
intes-</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>tine; moreover, portions of his spleen and his liver were eliminated
in the effusion of blood, so that he almost immediately died. 10</p>
<p>Hearing of this timely purge, Constantine began to wonder whether
Arius had not been a heretic after all. But when the Emperor himself
died, in the following year, he received the rites of baptism from his
friend and coun- selor Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia, an Arian.</p>
<p>Constantius took theology more seriously than his father. He made his
own inquiry into the paternity of Jesus, adopted the Arian view, and
felt a moral obligation to enforce it upon all Christendom. Athanasius,
who had re- turned to his see after Constantine’s death, was again
expelled (339) ; church councils, called and dominated by the new
Emperor, affirmed merely the likeness, not the consubstantiality, of
Christ with the Father; ecclesiastics loyal to the Nicene Creed were
removed from their churches, sometimes by the violence of mobs; for half
a century it seemed that Christianity would be Unitarian, and abandon
the divinity of Christ. In those bitter days Atha- nasius spoke of
himself as solus contra munduvi ; all the powers of the state were
opposed to him, and even his Alexandrian congregation turned against
him. Five times he fled from his see, often in peril of his life, and
wandered in alien lands; through half a century (323-73) he fought with
patient di- plomacy and eloquent vituperation for the creed as it had
been defined under his leadership at Nicaea; he stood firm even when
Pope Liberius gave in. To him, above all, the Church owes her doctrine
of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Athanasius laid his case before Pope Julius I (340). Julius restored
him to his see; but a council of Eastern bishops at Antioch (341) denied
the Pope’s jurisdiction, and named Gregory, an Arian, as bishop of
Alexandria. When Gregory reached the city the rival factions broke into
murderous riots, kill- ing many; and Athanasius, to end the bloodshed,
withdrew (342). 11 In Con- stantinople a similar contest raged; when
Constantius ordered the replace- ment of the orthodox patriot Paul by
the Arian Macedonius, a crowd of Paul’s suppor ters resisted the
soldiery, and three thousand persons lost their lives. Probably more
Christians were slaughtered by Christians in these two years (342-3)
than by all the persecutions of Christians by pagans in the history of
Rome.</p>
<p>Christians divided on almost every point but one — that the pagan
temples should be closed, their property confiscated, and the same
weapons of the state used against them and their worshipers that had
formerly assailed Chris- tianity. 12 Constantine had discouraged, but
not forbidden, pagan sacrifices and ceremonies; Constans forbade them on
pain of death; Constantius or- dered all pagan temples in the Empire
closed, and all pagan rituals to cease. Those who disobeyed were to
forfeit their property and their lives; and these penalties were
extended to provincial governors neglecting to enforce the decree. 13
Nevertheless, pagan isles remained in the spreading Christian sea.</p>
<p>CHAP, i) JULIAN THE APOSTATE 9</p>
<p>The older cities — Athens, Antioch, Smyrna, Alexandria, Rome — had a
large sprinkling of pagans, above all among the aristocracy and in the
schools. In Olympia the games continued till Theodosius I (379-95); in
Eleusis the Mysteries were celebrated till Alaric destroyed the temple
there in 396; and the schools of Athens continued to transmit, with
mollifying interpretations, the doctrines of Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno.
(Epicurus was outlawed, and be- came a synonym for atheist.) Constantine
and his son continued the salaries of the scholarchs and professors who
loosely constituted the University of Athens; lawyers and orators still
flocked there to learn the tricks of rhetoric; and pagan sophists —
teachers of wisdom — offered their wares to any who could pay. All
Athens was fond and proud of Prohaeresius, who had come there as a poor
youth, had shared one bed and cloak with another student, had risen to
the official chair of rhetoric, and at eighty-seven was still so
handsome, vigorous, and eloquent that his pupil Eunapius regarded him as
“an ageless and immortal god.” 14</p>
<p>But the leading sophist of the fourth century was Libanius. Bom at
Anti- och (3 14), he had tom himself away from a fond mother to go and
study at Athens; offered a rich heiress as wife if he would stay, he
declared that he would decline the hand of a goddess just to see the
smoke of Athens. 16 He used his teachers there as stimuli, not oracles;
and amid a maze of professors and schools he educated himself. After
lecturing for a time at Constantinople and Nicomedia, he returned to
Antioch (354), and set up a school that for forty years was the most
frequented and renowned in the Empire; his fame (he assures us) was so
great that his exordiums were sung in the streets. 16 Ammianus
Marcellinus, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Basil were among his pupils.
He enjoyed the favor of Christian princes, though he spoke and wrote in
defense of paganism and offered sacrifice in the temples. When the
bakers of Antioch went on strike he was chosen by both sides as
arbitrator; when Antioch revolted against Theodosius I he was named by
the chastened city to plead its cause before the Emperor. 17 He survived
by almost a generation the assassination of his friend Julian, and the
collapse of the pagan revival.</p>
<p>Fourth-century paganism took many forms: Mithraism, Neoplatonism,
Stoicism, Cynicism, and the local cults of municipal or rustic gods.
Mithraism had lost ground, but Neoplatonism was still a power in
religion and phi- losophy. Those doctrines to which Plotinus had given a
shadowy form — of a triune spirit binding all reality, of a Logos or
intermediary deity who had done the work of creation, of soul as divine
and matter as flesh and evil, of spheres of existence along whose
invisible stairs the soul had fallen from God to man and might ascend
from man to God — these mystic ideas lepft their mark on the apostles
Paul and John, had many imitators among the Chris- tians, and molded
many Christian heresies. 18 In Iamblichus of Syrian Chalcis miracle was
added to mystery in Neoplatonic philosophy: the mystic not only saw
things unseen by sense, but — by touching God in ecstasy — he ac 7</p>
<p>IO</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>quired divine powers of magic and divination. Iamblichus’ disciple,
Maximus of Tyre, combined the claim to mystic faculties with a devout
and eloquent paganism that conquered Julian. Said Maximus, defending
against Christian scorn the use of idols in pagan worship,</p>
<p>God the father and the fashioner of all that is, older than the sun
or sky, greater than time and eternity and all the flow of being, is
un-</p>
<p>namable by any lawgiver, unutterable by any voice, not to be seen</p>
<p>by any eye. But we, being unable to apprehend His essence, use the
help of sounds and names and pictures, of beaten gold and ivory and
silver, of plants and rivers, torrents and mountain peaks, yearning</p>
<p>for the knowledge of Him, and in our weakness naming after His</p>
<p>nature all that is beautiful in this world. … If a Greek is stirred
to</p>
<p>the remembrance of God by the art of Pheidias, or an Egyptian by</p>
<p>worshiping animals, or another man by a river or a fire, I have
no</p>
<p>anger for their divergences; only let them note, let them remember,
let them love. 19</p>
<p>It was in part the eloquence of Libanius and Maximus that won Julian
from Christianity to paganism. When their pupil reached the throne Maxi-
mus rushed to Constantinople, and Libanius raised in Antioch a song of
tri- umph and joy: “Behold us verily restored to life; a breath of
happiness passes over all the earth, while a veritable god, under the
appearance of a man, governs the world.” 20</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE NEW CAESAR</li>
</ol>
<p>Flavius Claudius Iulianus was born in the purple at Constantinople in
332, nephew of Constantine. His father, his eldest brother, and most of
his cousins were slain in the m assacre that inaugurated the reign of
Constantine’s sons. He was sent to Nicomedia to be educated by its
Bishop Eusebius; he received an overdose of Christian theology, and gave
signs of becoming a saint. At seven he began to study classical
literature with Mardonius; the old eunuch’s enthusiasm for Homer and
Hesiod passed down to his pupil, and Julian en- tered with wonder and
delight into the bright and poetic world of Greek mythology.</p>
<p>In 341, for reasons now unknown, Julian and his brother Gallus were
ban- ished to Cappadocia, and were for six years practically imprisoned
in the castle of Macellum. Released, Julian was for a time allowed to
live in Con- stantinople; but his youthful vivacity, sincerity, and wit
made him too popu- lar for the E mperor’s peace of mind. He was again
sent to Nicomedia, where</p>
<p>1 1</p>
<p>CHAP, i) JULIAN THE APOSTATE</p>
<p>pressionable lad of seventeen, ripe for the dangerous fascination of
phi- losophy. And while philosophy and free speculation came to him in
all their lure, Christianity was presented to him as at once a system of
unquestionable dogma and a Church torn with scandal and schism by the
Arian dispute and the mutual excommunications of East and West.</p>
<p>In 3 5 1 Gallus was created Caesar — i.e., heir apparent to the
throne — and took up the task of government at Antioch. Safe for a while
from imperial suspicion, Julian wandered from Nicomedia to Pergamum to
Ephesus, studying philosophy under Edesius, Maximus, and Chrysanthius,
who com- pleted his secret conversion to paganism. Suddenly in 3 54
Constantius sum- moned both Gallus and Julian to Milan, where he was
holding court. Gallus had overreached his authority, and had ruled the
Asiatic provinces with a despotic cruelty that shocked even Constantius.
Tried before the Emperor, he was convicted of various offenses, and was
summarily beheaded. Julian was kept under guard for several months in
Italy; at last he convinced a sus- picious monarch that politics had
never entered his head, and that his one interest was in philosophy.
Relieved to find that he had only a philosopher to deal with,
Constantius banished him to Athens (355). Having expected death, Julian
easily reconciled himself to an exile that placed him at the foun-
tainhead of pagan learning, religion, and thought.</p>
<p>Six happy months he spent there studying in the groves that had heard
Plato’s voice, making friends with Themistius and other immortal and for
- gotten philosophers, pleasing them with his eagerness to learn, and
charming the citizens with the grace and modesty of his conduct. He
compared these polished pagans, heirs of a millennium of culture, with
the grave theologians who had surrounded him in Nicomedia, or those
pious statesmen who had thought it necessary to kill his father, his
brothers, and so many more; and he concluded that there were no beasts
more ferocious than Christians. 21 He wept when he heard of famous
temples overthrown, of pagan priests proscribed, of their property
distributed to eunuchs and partisans. 22 It was probably at this time
that in cautious privacy he accepted initiation into the Mysteries at
Eleusis. The morals of paganism condoned the dissembling of his
apostasy. His friends and teachers, who shared his secret, could hardly
consent to his revealing it; they knew that Constantius would crown him
with inopportune martyrdom, and they looked forward to the time when
their protege would inherit the throne, and restore their emoluments and
their gods. For ten years Julian conformed in all externals to the
Christian worship, and even read the Scriptures publicly in church.
23</p>
<p>Amid all this apprehensive concealment a second summons came to pre-
sent himself before the Emperor at Milan. He hardly dared go; but word
was conveyed to him from the Empress Eusebia that she had promoted his
cause at court, and that he had nothing to fear. To his astonishment
Constantius gave him his sister Helena in marriage, conferred upon him
the title of</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>Caesar, and assigned to him the government of Gaul (3 55). The shy
young celibate, who had come dressed in the cloak of a philosopher,
adopted un- comfortably the uniform of a general and the duties of
matrimony. It must have further embarrassed him to learn that the
Germans, taking advantage of the civil wars that had almost destroyed
the military power of the Empire in the West, had’ invaded the Roman
provinces on the Rhine, defeated a Roman army, sacked the old Roman
colonia of Cologne, taken forty-four other towns, captured all Alsace,
and advanced forty miles into Gaul. Faced with this new crisis,
Constantius called upon the lad whom he both suspected and despised to
metamorphose himself at once into an administrator and a warrior. He
gave Julian a guard of 360 men, commissioned him to reorganize the army
of Gaul, and sent him over the Alps.</p>
<p>Julian spent the winter at Vienne on the Rhone, training himself with
military exercises, and zealously studying the art of war. In the spring
of 356 he collected an army at Reims, drove back the German invaders,
and re- captured Cologne. Besieged at Sens by the Alemanni — the tribe
that gave a name to Germany — he repulsed their attacks for thirty days,
managed to secure food for the population and his troops, and outwore
the patience of the enemy. Moving south, he met the main army of the
Alemanni near Stras- bourg, formed his men into a crescent wedge, and
with brilliant tactics and personal bravery led them to a decisive
victory over forces far outnumbering his own. 24 Gaul breathed more
freely; but in the north the Salian Franks still ravaged the valley of
the Meuse. Julian marched against them, defeated them, forced them back
over the Rhine, and returned in triumph to Paris, the provincial
capital. The grateful Gauls hailed the young Caesar as another Julius,
and his soldiers already voiced their hopes that he would soon be
emperor.</p>
<p>He remained five years in Gaul, repeopling devastated lands,
reorganizing the Rhine defenses, checking economic exploitation and
political corruption, restoring the prosperity of the province and the
solvency of the govern- ment, and at the same time reducing taxes. Men
marveled that this meditative youth, so lately torn from his books, had
transformed himself as if by magic into a general, a statesman, and a
just but humane judge. 25 He established the principle that an accused
person should be accounted innocent till proved guilty. Numerius, a
former governor of Gallia Narbonensis, was charged with embezzlement; he
denied the charge, and could not be confuted at any point. The judge
Delfidius, exasperated by lack of proofs, cried out: “Can anyone, most
mighty Caesar, ever be found guilty if it be enough to deny the charge?”
To which Julian replied: “Can anyone be proved innocent if it be enough
to have accus ed him?” “And this,” says Ammianus, “was one of many
instances of his humanity.” 26</p>
<p>His reforms made him enemies. Officials who feared his scrutiny, or
en- vied his popularity, sent to Constantius secret accusations to the
effect that</p>
<p>JULIAN THE APOSTATE</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Julian was planning to seize the imperial throne. Julian countered by
writing a fulsome panegyric of the Emperor. Constantius, still
suspicious, recalled the Gallic prefect Sallust, who had co-operated
loyally with Julian. If we may believe Ammianus, the Empress Eusebia,
childless and jealous, bribed at- tendants to give Julian’s wife an
abortifacient whenever she was with child; when, nevertheless, Helena
bore a son, the midwife cut its navel string so near the body that the
child bled to death. 27 Amid all these worries Julian received from
Constantius (360) a command to send the best elements of his Gallic army
to join in the war against Persia.</p>
<p>Constantius was not unjustified. Shapur II had demanded the return of
Mesopotamia and Armenia (358); when Constantius refused, Shapur be-
sieged and captured Amida (now Diyarbekir in Turkish Kurdistan). Con-
stantius took the field against him, and ordered Julian to turn over to
the imperial legates, for the campaign in Asia, 300 men from each Gallic
regi- ment. Julian protested that these troops had enlisted on the
understanding that they would not be asked to serve beyond the Alps; and
he warned that Gaul would not be safe should her army be so depleted.
(Six years later the Germans successfully invaded Gaul.) Nevertheless,
he ordered his soldiers to obey the legates. The soldiers refused,
surrounded Julian’s palace, ac - claimed him Augustus — i.e., Emperor —
and begged him to keep them in Gaul. He again counseled obedience; they
persisted; Julian, feeling, like an earlier Caesar, that the die was
cast, accepted the imperial title, and prepared to fight for the Empire
and his life. The army that had refused to leave Gaul now pledged itself
to march to Constantinople and seat Julian on the throne.</p>
<p>Constantius was in Cilicia when news reached him of the revolt. For
an- other year he fought Persia, risking his throne to protect his
country; then, having signed a truce with Shapur, he marched his legions
westward to meet his cousin. Julian advanced with a small force. He
stopped for a while at Sirmium (near Belgrade), and there at last
proclaimed his paganism to the world. To Maximus he wrote
enthusiastically: “We now publicly adore the gods, and all the army that
followed me is devoted to their worship.” 28 Good fortune rescued him
from a precarious position: in November 361 Con- stantius died of a
fever near Tarsus, in the forty-fifth year of his age. A month later
Julian entered Constantinople, ascended the throne without op- position,
and presided with all the appearance of a loving cousin over Con-
stantius’ funeral.</p>

<li>THE PAGAN EMPEROR</li>
</ol>
<p>Julian was now thirty-one. Ammianus, who saw him often, describes him
as</p>
<p>of medium stature. His hair lay smooth as if it had been combed;</p>
<p>and his beard was shaggy and trained to a point; his eyes were
bright</p>
<p>H</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>and full of lire, bespeaking the keenness of his mind. His
eyebrows</p>
<p>fine, his nose perfectly straight, his mouth a bit large, with full
lower lip; his neck thick and bent, his shoulders large and broad. From
his</p>
<p>head to his fingertips he was well proportioned, and therefore
was</p>
<p>strong and a good runner . 29</p>
<p>His self-portrait is not so flattering:</p>
<p>Though nature did not make my face any too handsome, nor give</p>
<p>it the bloom of youth, I myself out of sheer perversity added to
it</p>
<p>this long beard. … I put up with the lice that scamper about in
it</p>
<p>as though it were a thicket for wild beasts My head is
disheveled;</p>
<p>I seldom cut my hair or my nails, and my fingers are nearly
always</p>
<p>black with ink . 30</p>
<p>He prided himself on maintaining the simplicity of a philosopher amid
the luxuries of the court. He rid himself at once of the eunuchs,
barbers, and spies that had served Constantius. His young wife having
died, he resolved not to marry again, and so needed no eunuch; one
barber, he felt, could take care of the whole palace staff; as for
cooks, he ate only the plainest foods, which anyone could prepare . 31
This pagan lived and dressed like a monk. Apparently he knew no woman
carnally after the death of his wife. He slept on a hard pallet in an
unheated room ; 32 he kept all his chambers unheated throughout the
winter “to accustom myself to bear the cold.” He had no taste for
amusements. He shunned the theater with its libidinous panto- mimes, and
offended the populace by staying away from the Hippodrome; on solemn
festivals he attended for a while, but finding one race like another, he
soon withdrew. At first the people were impressed by his virtues, his
as- ceticism, his devotion to the chores and crises of government; they
compared him to Trajan as a general, to Antoninus Pius as a saint, to
Marcus Aurelius as a philosopher-king . 38 We are surprised to see how
readily this young pagan was accepted by a city and an Empire that for a
generation had known none but Christian emperors.</p>
<p>He pleased the Byzantine Senate by his modest observance of its
traditions and prerogatives. He rose from his seat to greet the consuls,
and in general played the Augustan game of holding himself a servant and
delegate of the senators and the people. When, inadvertently, he
infringed a senatorial privi- lege, he fined himself ten pounds of gold,
and declared that he was subject like his fellow citizens to the laws
and forms of the republic. From morn till night he toiled at the tasks
of government, except for an intermission in the afternoon, which he
reserved for study. His light diet, we are told, gave his body and mind
a nervous agility that passed swiftly from one business or visitor to
another, and exhausted three secretaries every day. He performed with
assiduity and interest the functions of a judge; exposed the sophistry
of advocates; yielded with grace to the sustained opinions of judges
against his</p>
<p>CHAP, i) JULIAN THE APOSTATE 15</p>
<p>own; and impressed everyone with the righteousness of his decisions.
He reduced the taxes levied upon the poor, refused the gift of golden
crowns traditionally offered by each province to a new emperor, excused
Africa from accumulated arrears, and remitted the excessive tribute
heretofore ex- acted from the Jews . 34 He made stricter, and strictly
enforced, the require- ments for a license to practice medicine. His
success as an administrator crowned his triumph as a general; “his
fame,” says Ammianus, “gradually spread until it filled the whole
world.” 35</p>
<p>Amid all these activities of government his ruling passion was
philosophy, and his never-forgotten purpose was to restore the ancient
cults. He gave orders that the pagan temples should be repaired and
opened, that their con- fiscated property should be restored, and their
accustomed revenues re- newed. He dispatched letters to the leading
philosophers of the day, inviting them to come and live as his guests at
his court. When Maximus arrived, Julian interrupted the address he was
making to the Senate, ran at full speed to greet his old teacher, and
introduced him with grateful praise. Maximus took advantage of t he
Emperor’s enthusiasm, assumed ornate robes and lux - urious ways, and
was subjected, after Julian’s death, to severe scrutiny of the means by
which he had acquired so rapidly such unbecoming wealth . 36 Julian took
no notice of these contradictions; he loved philosophy too much to be
dissuaded from it by the conduct of philosophers. “If anyone,” he wrote
to Eumenius, “has persuaded you that there is anything more profit -
able to the human race than to pursue philosophy at one’s leisure
without inte rruptions, he is a deluded man trying to delude you.”
37</p>
<p>He loved books, carried a library with him on his campaigns, vastly
en- larged the library that Constantine had founded, and established
others. “Some men,” he wrote, “have a passion for horses, others for
birds, others for wild beasts; but I from childhood have been possessed
by a passionate longing to acquire books.” 38 Proud to be an author as
well as a statesman, he sought to justify his policies with dialogues in
the manner of Lucian, or orations in the style of Libanius, letters
almost as fresh and charming as Cicero’s, and formal philosophical
treatises. In a “Hymn to a King’s Son” he expounded his new paganism; in
an essay “Against the Galileans” he gave his reasons for abandoning
Christianity. The Gospels, he writes, in a preview of Higher Criticism,
contradict one another, and agree chiefly in their in- credibility; the
Gospel of John differs substantially from the other three in narrative
and theology; and the creation story of Genesis assumes a plurality of
gods.</p>
<p>Unless every one of these legends 〔of Genesis〕 is a myth,
involv-</p>
<p>ing, as I indeed believe, some secret interpretation, they are
filled</p>
<p>with blasphemies against God. In the first place He is represented as
ignorant that she who was created to be a helpmate to Adam would be the
cause of man’s fall. Secondly, to refuse to man a knowledge of</p>
<p>i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>good and evil (which knowledge alone gives coherence to the hu-</p>
<p>man mind), and to be jealous lest man should become immortal by-
partaking of the tree of life — this is to be an exceedingly grudging
and envious god. Why is your god so jealous, even avenging the sins</p>
<p>of the fathers upon the children? . . . Why is so mighty a god so
angry against demons, angels, and men? Compare his behavior with the</p>
<p>mildness even of Lycurgus and the Romans towards transgressors.</p>
<p>The Old Testament (like paganism) sanctioned and required animal</p>
<p>sacrifice. . . . Why do you not accept the Law which God gave the</p>
<p>Jews? . . . You assert that the earlier Law . . . was limited in time
and place. But I could quote to you from the books of Moses not merely
ten but ten thousand passages where he says that the Law is for all</p>
<p>time . 89</p>
<p>When Julian sought to restore paganism he found it not only irrecon-
cilably diverse in practice and creed, but far more permeated with
incredible miracle and myth than Christianity; and he realized that no
religion can hope to win and move the common soul unless it clothes its
moral doctrine in a splendor of marvel, legend, and ritual. He was
impressed by the antiquity and universality of myths. “One could no more
discover when myth was originally invented . . . than one could find out
who was the first man that sneezed.” 40 He resigned himself to
mythology, and condoned the use of myths to instill morality’ into
unlettered minds . 41 He himself told again the story of Cybele, and how
the Great Mother had been carried in the form of a black stone from
Phrygia to Rome; and no one could surmise from his narrative that he
doubted the divinity of the stone, or the efficacy of its trans-
ference. He discovered the need of sensory symbolism to convey spiritual
ideas, and adopted the Mithraic worship of the sun as a religious
counterpart, among the people, of the philosopher’s devotion to reason
and light. It was not difficult for this poet-king to pen a hymn to
Helios King Sun, source of all life, author of countless blessings to
mankind; this, he suggested, was the real Logos, or Divine Word, that
had created, and now sustained, the world. To this Supreme Principle and
First Cause Julian added the innumerable deities and genii of the old
pagan creeds; a tolerant philosopher, he thought, would not strain at
swallowing them all.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to picture Julian as a freethinker replacing
myth with reason. He denounced atheism as bestial , 42 and taught
doctrines as su- pernatural as can be found in any creed. Seldom has a
man composed such nonsense as in Julia n’s hymn to the sun. He accepted
the Neoplatonist trinity, identified Plato’s creative archetypal Ideas
with the mind of God, considered them as the intermediary Logos or
Wisdom by which all things had been made, and looked upon the world of
matter and body as a devilish impediment to the virtue and liberation of
the imprisoned soul. Through piety, goodness, and philosophy, the soul
might free itself, rise to the con- CHAP, i) JULIAN THE APOSTATE 17</p>
<p>temptation of spiritual realities and laws, and so be absorbed in the
Logos, perhaps in the ultimate God Himself. The deities of polytheism
were in Julian’s belief impersonal forces; he could not accept them in
their popular anthropomorphic forms; but he knew that the people would
seldom mount to the abstractions of the philosopher, or the mystic
visions of the saint. In public and private he practiced the old
rituals, and sacrificed so many animals to the gods that even his
admirers blushed for his holocausts . 43 During his campaigns against
Persia he regularly consulted the omens, after the fashion of Roman
generals, and listened carefully to the interpreters of his dreams. He
seems to have credited the magic-mongering of Maximus.</p>
<p>Like every reformer, he thought that the world needed a moral renova-
tion; and to this end he designed no mere external legislation but a
religious approach to the inner hearts of men. He had been deeply moved
by the sym- bolism of the Mysteries at Eleusis and Ephesus; no ceremony
seemed to him better fitted to inspire a new and nobler life; and he
hoped that these im- pressive rites of initiation and consecration might
be extended from an aris- tocratic few to a large proportion of the
people. According to Libanius, “he wished rather to be called a priest
th an an emperor.” 44 He envied the ecclesi - astical hierarchy of
Christianity, its devoted priests and women, the com- munalism of its
worship, the binding persuasiveness of its charity. He was not above
imitating the better aspects of a religion which he hoped to sup- plant
and destroy. He called new blood into the pagan priesthood, organized a
pagan Church with himself as its head, and importuned his clergy to
rival and surpass the Christian ministry in providing instruction to the
people, distributing alms to the poor, offering hospitality to
strangers, and giving examples of the good life . 46 He established in
every town schools for lectures and expositions of the pagan faith. To
his pagan priests he wrote like a Fran- cis to fellow monks:</p>
<p>Act towards me as you think I should act towards you; if you
like,</p>
<p>let us make this compact, that I am to point out to you what are my
views concerning all your affairs, and you in return are to do the</p>
<p>same for me concerning my sayings and doings. Nothing in my opin- ion
could be more valuable for us than this reciprocity. . . . 48 We</p>
<p>ought to share our money with all men, but more generally with the
good and the helpless and the poor. And I will assert, though it
will</p>
<p>seem paradoxical, that it would be a pious act to share our
clothes</p>
<p>and food even with the wicked. For it is to the humanity in a man</p>
<p>that we give, and not to his moral character . 47</p>
<p>This pagan was a Christian in everything but creed- and as we read
him, and discount his dead mythology, we suspect that he owed many
lovable developments of his character to the Christian ethic which had
been poured into him in childhood and early youth. How, then, did he
behave to the religion in which he had been reared? He allowed
Christianity full freedoqi</p>
<p>i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>of preaching, worship, and practice, and recalled the orthodox
bishops exiled by Constantius. He withdrew from the Christian Church all
state subsidies, and closed to Christians the chairs of rhetoric,
philosophy, and literature in the universities, on the ground that these
subjects could be taught with sym- pathy only by pagans. 48 He ended the
exemption of the Christian clergy from taxation and burdensome civic
duties, and the free use by the bishops of the facilities supplied for
the public post. He forbade legacies to churches; made Christians
ineligible to governmental offices; 49 ordered the Christians of each
community to make full reparation for any damage that they had inflicted
upon pagan temples during preceding reigns; and permitted the demolition
of Christian churches that had been built upon the illegally seized
lands of pagan shrines. When confusion, injustice, and riots resulted
from this precipitate logic, Julian sought to protect the Christians,
but he refused to change his laws. He was capable of sarcasm hardly
becoming a philosopher when he reminded certain Christians who had
suffered violence that “their Scriptures exhort them to support their
misfortunes with pa - tience.” B0 Christians who reacted to these laws
with insults or violence were severely punished; pagans who took to
violence or insults in dealing with Christians were handled with
leniency. 61 In Alexandria the pagan populace had nursed a special
hatred for that Arian Bishop George who had taken Athanasius’ see; when
he provoked them by a public procession satirizing the Mithraic rites
they seized him and tore him to pieces; and though few Christians cared
to defend him, many Christians were killed or wounded in the attendant
disorders (362). Julian wished to punish the rioters, but his advisers
prevailed upon him to content himself with a letter of strong protest to
the people of Alexandria. Athanasius now came out of hiding, and re-
sumed his episcopal seat; Julian protested that this was done without
consult- ing him, and ordered Athanasius to retire. The old prelate
obeyed; but in the following year the Emperor died, and the Patriarch,
symbol of the tri- umphant Galileans, returned to his see. Ten ye^rs
later, aged eighty, he passed away, rich in honors and scars.</p>
<p>In the end Julian’s passionate perseverance defeated his program.
Those whom he injured fought him with subtle pertinacity; those whom he
favored responded with indifference. Paganism was spiritually dead; it
no longer had in it any stimulus to youth, any solace to sorrow, any
hope beyond the grave. Some converts came to it, but mostly in
expectation of political advancement or imperial gold; some cities
restored the official sacrifices, but only in pay- ment for favors; at
Pessinus itself, home of Cybele, Julian had to bribe the inhabitants to
honor the Great Mother. Many pagans interpreted paganism to mean a good
conscience in pleasure. They were disappointed to find Julian more
puritan than Christ. This supposed freethinker was the most pious man in
the state, and even his friends felt it a nuisance to keep pace with his
devotions; or they were skeptics who not too privately smiled at his</p>
<p>CHAP, i) JULIAN THE APOSTATE 19</p>
<p>outmoded deities and solicitous hecatombs. The custom of sacrificing
ani- mals on altars had almost died out in the East, and in the West
outside of Italy; people had come to think of it as a disgrace or a
mess. Julian called his movement Hellenism, but the word repelled the
pagans of Italy, who scorned anything Greek that was not dead. He relied
too much on philo- sophical argument, which never reached to the
emotional bases of faith; his works were intelligible only to the
educated, who were too educated to ac- cept them; his creed was an
artificial syncretism that struck no roots in the hopes or fancies of
men. Even before he died his failure had become evident; and the army
that loved and mourned him named a Christian to succeed to his
throne.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>journey’s end</li>
</ol>
<p>His last great dream was to rival Alexander and Trajan: to plant
the</p>
<p>Roman standards in the Persian capitals, and end once and for all the
Persian threat to the security of the Roman Empire. Eagerly he organized
his army, chose his officers, repaired thq frontier fortresses,
provisioned the towns that would mark his route to victory. In the fall
of 362 he came to Antioch, and gathered his troops. The merchants of the
city took advantage of the influx to raise prices; the people c
omplained that “everything is plentiful but every - thing is dear.”
Julian called in the economic leaders and pled with them to restrain
their profit seeking; they promised, but did not perform; and at last he
“appointed a fair price for everything, and made it known to all men.”
Perhaps to force prices down he had 400,000 modii (pecks) of corn
brought in from other cities in Syria and Egypt. 62 The merchants
protested that his prices made profit impossible; they secretly bought
up the imported corn, took it and their goods to other towns, and
Antioch found itself with much money and no food. Soon the populace
denounced Julian for his interfer- ence. The wits of Antioch made fun of
his beard, and of his laborious at- tendance upon dead gods. He replied
to them in a pamphlet, Misopogon, or Hater of Beards, whose wit and
brilliance hardly became an emperor. He sarcastically apologized for his
beard, and berated the Antiocheans for their insolence, frivolity,
extravagance, immorality, and indifference to the gods of Greece. The
famous park called Daphne, once a sacred shrine of Apollo, had been
changed into an amusement resort; Julian ordered the amusements ended
and the shrine restored; this had hardly been completed when a fire
consumed it. Suspecting Christian incendiarism, Julian closed the
cathedral of Antioch, and confiscated its wealth; several witnesses were
tortured, and a priest was put to death. 63 The Emperor’s one
consolation in Antioch was his “feast of reason” with Libanius.</p>
<p>At last the army was ready, and in March 363 Julian began his
campaign. He led his forces across the Euphrates, then across the
Tigris; pursued the re-</p>
<p>20 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. I</p>
<p>treating Persians, but was harassed and almost frustrated by their
“sco rched earth” policy of burning all crops in their wake; time and
again his soldiers were near starvation. In this exhausting campaign the
Emperor showed his best qualities; he shared every hardship with his
men, ate their scant fare or less, marched on. foot through heat and
flood, and fought in the front ranks in every battle. Persian women of
youth and beauty were among his captives; he never disturbed their
privacy, and allowed no one to dishonor them. Under his able generalship
his troops advanced to the very gates of Ctesi- phon, and laid siege to
it; but the inability to get food compelled retreat. Shapur II chose two
Persian nobles, cut off their noses, and bade them go to Julian in the
guise of men who had deserted because of this cruel indignity, and lead
him into a desert. They obeyed; Julian trusted them, and followed them,
with his army, for twenty miles into a waterless waste. While he was
extricating his men from this snare they were attacked by a force of
Persians. The attack was repulsed, and the Persians fled. Julian,
careless of his lack of armor, was foremost in their pursuit. A javelin
entered his side and pierced his liver. He fell from his horse and was
carried to a tent, where his physi- cians warned him that he had but a
few hours to live. Libanius alleged that the weapon came from a
Christian hand, and it was noted that no Persian claimed the reward that
Shapur had promised for the slaying of the Emperor. Some Christians,
like Sozomen, agreed with Libanius’ account, and praised the assassin
“who for the sake of God and religion had performed so bold a deed.” 84
The final scene (June 27, 363) was in the tradition of Socrates and
Seneca. Julian, says Ammianus,</p>
<p>lying in his tent, addressed his disconsolate and sorrowing com-</p>
<p>panions: “Most opportunely, friends, has the time now come for me to
leave this life, which I rejoice to restore to Nature at her
demand.”</p>
<p>. . . AH present wept, whereupon, even then maintaining his au-</p>
<p>thority, he chided them, saying that it was unbecoming for them
to</p>
<p>mourn for a prince who was called for a union with heaven and the</p>
<p>stars. As this made them all silent, he engaged with the philosophers
Maximus and Priscus in an intricate discussion about the nobility of</p>
<p>the soul. Suddenly the wound in his side opened wide, the pressure of
the blood checked his breath, and after a draught of cold water for
which he had asked, he passed quietly away, in the thirty-second</p>
<p>year of his age . 55 *</p>
<p>The army, still in peril, required a commander; and its leaders chose
Jo- vian, captain of the imperial guard. The new Emperor made peace with
