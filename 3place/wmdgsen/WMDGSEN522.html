<h4 id="chapter-iv-the-art-of-life">CHAPTER IV The Art of Life</h4>
<p>I. MORALITY AND GRACE</p>
<p>H E who has not lived in the years around 1780,” said Talleyrand,
“has not known the pleasure of life.”* Provided, of course, one belonged
to the upper classes, and had no prejudices in favor of morality.</p>
<p>It is hard to define morality, for each age makes its own definition
to suit its temper and sins. Frenchmen had through centuries relieved
monogamy with adultery, as America relieves it with divorce; and in the
Gallic view judicious adultery does less hurt to the family — or at
least to the children — than divorce. In any case adultery flourished in
eighteenth-century France, and was generally condoned. When Diderot, in
his Encyclopedic, wished to distinguish bind and attach, he gave as
example: “One is bound to one’s wife, attached to one’s mistress.” 2
“Fifteen out of twenty of the noble lords about the court,” according to
a contemporary, “are living with women to whom they are not marrie d.” 3
To have won a mistress was as necessary to status as to have money. Love
was frankly sensual: Boucher painted it en rose, Fragonard gave it lace
and grace; Buffon said, brutally, “There is nothing good in love but the
flesh.” 4</p>
<p>Here and there the finer love appeared, even in Crebillon fils f and
among the philosophes Helvetius dared to be enamored of his wife, while
d’Alem - bert remained faithful to Julie de Lespinasse through all the
variations on her absorbing theme. Jean- Jacques Rousseau undertook in
this age a one-man reform of morals; and shall we also credit the novels
of Samuel Richardson? Some women put on virtue as a fashion, 6 but some
received gratefully the recollected gospel of premarital chastity and
postmarital fidelity as saving them from the indignity of serving as
steppingstones for philanderers. At least monogamy ceased to be a badge
of shame. Roues, married, rediscovered old pleasures in family life;
better to plumb the depths of unity than be for- ever scratching the
surface of variety. Many women who had begun as frivolous surfaces
settled down when children came; some nursed their chil- dren, even
before Rousseau’s exhortations; and often those children, growing up
under maternal love, returned it with filial interest. The Marechale de
Luxembourg, after an adventurous youth, became a model wife, faithful to
her husband while gently mothering Rousseau. When the Comte de Maure-
pas died (1781), after serving both Louis XV and Louis XVI and suffering
a long exile between his ministries, his wife recalled that they “had
spent</p>
<ul>
<li>“ Qui n’a pas vecu dans les annees voisine de 1780 n’a pas connu le
plaisir de vivre.” So this famous remark appears in P. Dupre’s
Encyclopedic de s citations (Paris, 1959), 1, 635, which quotes, as
source, Fr. Guizot’s Memoires pour servir a Vhistoire de mon temps
(Paris, 1858-68),!, 6. 1</li>
</ul>
<p>97</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>fifty years together, and not one day apart.” 7 We hear too much— we
our- selves have spoken too much — of women who gained entrance into
history by breaking marriage vows; we hear too little of those who could
not be made unfaithful even by infidelity. Mile. Crozat, betrothed at
twelve to the future Due de Choiseul, bore with patience his infatuation
with his ambitious sister; she accompanied him in exile, and even the
sophisticated Walpole honored her as a saint. The Duchesse de Richelieu
continued to love her hus- band through all his adulteries, and was
grateful that fate allowed her to die in his arms. 8</p>
<p>Perversions, pornography, and prostitution continued. French law re-
quired the penalty of death for sodomy, and indeed two pederasts were
burned in the Place de Greve in 1750; 9 but usually the law ignored
voluntary and private homosexual acts between adults. 10 Economic
morality was then as now; note the passage in Rousseau’s Emile 11 (1762)
about the adulteration</p>
<p>All in all, the French of the eighteenth century were a kindly
people, de- spite a code of sexual ethics that violated Christian norms
by its candor. See, in the career of Rousseau, the number of people who
came to his aid and comfort despite the difficulty of pleasing him; and
often these sympathetic souls belonged to that aristocracy which he had
reviled. Chivalry had declined in the relation of men to women, but it
survived in the conduct of French officers to war captives of their
class. The irritable and hostile Smollett, travel- ing in France in
1764, wrote: “I respect the French officers in particular for their
gallantry and valor, and especially for that generous humanity which
they experience to their enemies, even amidst the horrors of war.” 12
Goya pictured, but probably exaggerated, the cruelty of French soldiers
to Spanish commoners in the Napoleonic Wars. Certainly the French could
be callously cruel, presumably because they had been inured to brutality
by war and the penal code. They were turbulent, given to knife- wielding
college brawls, and to street riots as a substitute for elections. They
were impetuous, and plunged into good or evil with little loss of time
in deliberation. They were chauvin- ists who could not understand why
the rest of the world was so barbarous as to speak any other language
but French. Mme. Denis refused to learn the English word for bread —
“Why can’t th ey all say pain? ma Perhaps more than any other people
they loved glory. Soon they would die by the thousands crying, “Vive
rEmpereur!“</p>
<p>Of course the French were supreme in manners. The customs of courtesy
established under Louis XIV were tarnished by hypocrisy, cynicism, and
superficiality, but essentially they survived, and gave to life in the
educated classes a grace which no society can rival today. “The French
are so polite, so obliging,” said Casanova, “that one feels drawn to
them at once”— hut he adds that he could never trust them. 14</p>
<p>CHAP. IV )</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>They excelled in cleanliness; in the Frenchwoman this became one of
the cardinal virtues, practiced till death. And it was a part of good
manners to be neatly dressed. The men and women of the court sometimes
sinned against good taste by extensive finery or extravagant coiffures.
A 4 en wore their hair in a queue, which Marechal de Saxe deprecated as
dangerous in war, giving a handle to the enemy; and they powdered their
hair as assiduously as did their ladies. The women raised their hair to
such elevation that they feared to dance, lest they catch fire from
chandeliers. A German visitor calculated that the chin of a French lady
lay exactly midway between her feet and the top of her hair. 15
Hairdressers made fortunes by changing hair fashions fre- quently.
Cleanliness did not extend to the female hair, for this took hours to
arrange, and all but the fanciest women kept the same hairdos for days
with- out disturbing them with a comb. Some ladies carried grattoirs of
ivory, silver, or gold, to scratch the head with piquant grace.</p>
<p>Facial make-up was as complex as now. Leopold Mozart wrote to his
wife from Paris in 1763: “You ask if Parisian ladies are beautiful. How
can one say, when they are painted like Nuremberg dolls, and so
disfigured by this repulsive trick that the eyes of an honest German
cannot tell a naturally beautiful woman when he sees her?” 16 Women
carried their cosmetics with them, and renewed their complexions in
public as brazenly as today. Mme. de Monaco rouged herself before riding
off to be guillotined. Corpses were made up, powdered, and rouged, as in
our time. Feminine dress offered a challenging mixture of invitations
and impediments: low necklines, lacy bodices, hypnotizing gems, great
spreading skirts, and high-heeled shoes, usually of linen or silk.
Buffon, Rousseau, and others protested against cor- sets, but these
remained de rigueur till the Revolution discarded them.</p>
<p>The variety and gaiety of social life were among the attractions of
Paris. The cafes Procope, La Regence, and Gradot entertained
intellectuals and rebels, men about town and women about men, while the
luminaries of liter- ature, music, and art shone in the salons. The
lords of pedigree or wealth kept Versailles and Paris dancing with
dinners, receptions, and balls. In the upper classes the arts included
eating and conversation. The French cuisine was the envy of Europe.
French wit had now reached a refinement where it had worn all topics
thin, and boredom clouded brilliance. The art of conversation declined
in the second half of the eighteenth century; declamation over- heated
it, speakers outran listeners, and wit was cheapened by its own pro-
fusion and its careless stings. Voltaire, who himself could sting,
reminded Paris that wit without courtesy is crudity; 17 and La Chalotais
thought that “the taste for cleverness… has banished science and true
learning” from the salons. 18</p>
<p>In the parks — which were neatly groomed and alive with statuary —
people strolled at their ease, or followed their children or their dogs,
and gay blades pursued damsels skilled in vain retreat. The Gardens of
the Tuileries were probably more beautiful then than now. Hear Mme.
Vigee-Lebrun:</p>
<p>The Opera was close by in those days, bordering on the Palais-Royal.
In summer the performance ended at half- past eight o’clock, and all the
elegant people came out, even before the end, to walk about the grounds.
It was the</p>
<p>IOO</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>fashion for women to carry very large nosegays, which, together with
the scented powder in their hair, literally perfumed the air…. I have
known these gatherings, before the Revolution, to continue till two in
the morning. There were musical performances by moonlight in the open….
There was always a great crowd. 19</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>France took music as part of its gaiete Parisienne. She did not care
to rival Germany in Masses and solemn chorales; she almost ignored
Mozart when he came to Paris, but she forgot to be chauvinistic when her
ears were charmed by Italian melodies. She made fetes galantes out of
her music; she specialized in forms fit for, or recalling, the dance —
courantes, sarabandes, gigues, gavottes, minuets. Her music, like her
morals, her manners, and her arts, circled around woman, and often took
names that recalled her image — V Enchanter esse, L’lngenue, Mimi,
Carillon de Cy there.</p>
<p>In France, as in Italy, opera buff a was more popular than opera
seria before Gluck came (1773). A troupe calling itself Opera-Comique
had installed itself in Paris in 1714; in 1762 it merged with the
Comedie-Italienne; in 1780 this enlarged Opera-Comique moved to a
permanent home in the Salle Fa- vart. The man who made its fortune was
Francois- Andre Philidor, who trav- eled through Europe as chess
champion, and composed twenty-five operas, nearly all of a humorous
turn, like Sancho Pan fa and Tom Jones, but show- ing good taste and
finished art. His operas are now forgot ten, but “Philidor’s defense”
and “Philidor’s legacy” are still remembered as classic moves in chess.
Ballet was a favorite interlude in French opera; here French grace found
another outlet, and motion became poetry. Jean-Georges Noverre, ballet
master at the Paris Opera, wrote a once famous treatise on choreogra-
phy — Lettres sur la danse et les ballets (1760); this prepared the way
for Gluck’s reforms by advocating a return to Greek ideals of the dance,
with naturalness of movement, simplicity of costume, and emphasis on
dramatic significance rather than on abstract configurations or virtuoso
feats.</p>
<p>Public concerts were now a part of life in all the major cities of
France. In Paris the Concerts Spirituels (established in the Tuileries
in 1725) set a high standard of instrumental music. While the
Opera-Comique played Per- golesi’s La serva padrona, the Concerts
performed his Stabat Mater, which was so well received that it was
repeated annually till 1 8 00. 20 The Concerts brought the compositions
of Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Jommelli, Piccini, and the Bachs to French
acceptance, and provided a platform for the leading virtuosos of the
day.</p>
<p>These visiting performers agreed in one thing — that France lagged
behind Germany, Austria, and Italy in music. The philosophes joined in
this judg- ment. “It is a pity,” wrote Grimm (a German) “that people in
this country understand so little of music”; 21 he excepted Mile. Fel,
who sang with a lovely throat. Grimm concurred with Rousseau and Diderot
in asking for a “return</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OK LIFE</p>
<p>IOI</p>
<p>Bouffons which had begun with the presentation of an opera buff a by
an Italian company in Paris. We have noted elsewhere this debate between
French and Italian musical styles; it was not yet over, for Diderot was
still fighting the “War of the Buffoons” in his Le Neveu de Rameau; and
in his Troisieme Entretien sur Le Fils naturel (1757) he called for a
Messiah to redeem French opera from pompous declamation and fanciful
artifice. “Let</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that some genius may arise, strong enough to
convert the nation from this abuse [of artifice], and to impart to a
stage production… the dignity and ethic spirit that it now lacks…. The
tide of bad taste is rising, insensibly submerging the memory of what
was once the glory of the nation. Yet again I repeat: the opera must be
set on a different footing, that it may no longer deserve the scorn with
which it is regarded by all the nations of Europe. 23</p>
<p>In 1773 Gluck arrived in Paris, and on April 19, 1774, he conducted
there the French premiere of lphigenie en Aulide. But that story must
bide its time.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>France produced in this period no plays that have defied oblivion —
perhaps excepting a few of those that Voltaire sent up from Les Delices
or Ferney. But France gave the drama every encouragement of staging and
acclaim. In 1 77 3 Victor Louis raised at Bordeaux the finest theater in
the realm, with a pompous portico of Corinthian columns, classic
balustrade, and sculptural embellishments. The Comedie-Frangaise,
acknowledged by Garrick to be the best group of actors in Europe, was
housed in the Theatre-F rangais built in 1683 in the Rue des Fosses,
St.-Germain-des-Pres: three tiers of galleries in a narrow oblong that
compelled declamation and set the oratorical style of acting in France.
Hundreds of families staged private theatricals, from Vol- taire at
Ferney to the Queen at Trianon — where Marie Antoinette played Colette
in Rousseau’s Le Devin du village— and the Prince de Ligne thought that
“more than ten ladies of quality play and si ng better than any in the
playhouse.” 24 “Little theaters” sprouted everywhere in France. A
Bernardine monastery, hidden in the woods of Bresse, built a small
theater for its monks, “without” (said one of them) “the knowledge of
bigots and small minds.” 25</p>
<p>Despite amateur competition, the stars of the Comedie-F rangaise
shone brightly over France. We have seen how the people of Geneva and
Ferney came out to see Lekain when he played for Voltaire at Chatelaine.
His real name was Henri-Louis Cain, but this was a cursed cognomen which
he for- givably changed. Neither was his face his fortune; Mile. Clairon
took some time to warm to him even in a play. Voltaire had discovered
his ability in an amateur performance, had coached him, and had found a
place for him at the</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Theatre-Frangais. On September 14, 1750, Lekain made his debut as
Titus in Voltaire’s Brutus; and for a generation thereafter he took the
male lead in Voltaire’s plays. The irascible patriarch loved him to the
end.</p>
<p>But Voltaire’s stage favorite (now that Adrienne Lecouvreur had
passed away) was Mile. Clairon. Legally she was Claire-Josephe Hippolyte
Leris de La Tude. Born without benefit of marriage in 1723, and not
expected to survive, she lived to be eighty — which is not always a
blessing for the heroines of the stage. It was not thought worth while
to educate her, but she stole her way into the Theatre-Frangais, was
entranced by the scenery-plus-orations, and never quite overcame a
tendency to make speeches even in the ecstasy of love. She announced
that she would be an actress; her mother threatened to break her arms
and legs if she persisted in so sinful a resolve; 26 she persisted and
joined a traveling troupe. She soon acquired the morals that were
custom- ary in her new profession. “Thanks to my talent, my good looks,
and the ease with which I could be approached, I saw so many men at my
feet that it would have been impossible for me, being endowed with a
naturally tender heart,… to be inaccessible to love.” 27</p>
<p>Back in Paris, she charmed M. de La Popeliniere; he enjoyed her, and
then used his influence to get her a place at the Opera; four months
later the Duchesse de Chateauroux, current mistress to the King, secured
her admis- sion to the Comedie-Frangaise. The company asked her to
choose her first role, expecting her to follow custom and select a minor
part; she proposed to play Phedre; the company protested, but let her
have her way; she carried off the adventure triumphantly. Henceforth she
starred in tragic roles, in which her only rival was Mile. Dumesnil. She
gained a reputation for acquisi- tive promiscuity. She entertained a
roster of nobles, made them pay well, hoarded her gains, and then
yielded much of them to her favorite lover, the Chevalier de Jaucourt,
who wrote articles on economics for the Encyclo- pedic. She paid a
price, too, for the attentions of Marmontel, whom we shall soon meet as
the author of Moral Tales. Consider the woman’s side of it in her letter
to him: “Is it possible that you did not know what troubles you caused
me (unintentionally, but I had them all the same), and that those
troubles have kept me in bed for six weeks, in critical danger? I cannot
be- lieve that you were aware of this, else you would not have gone out
in so- ciety while everybody knew what condition I was in.” 28
Nevertheless she and Marmontel remained fast friends for thirty
years.</p>
<p>It was he whose criticisms and suggestions led her to make an
important change in acting. Till 1748 she had followed the method usual
at the Theatre-Frangais — forceful and emotional speech, grand gestures,
trembling passion. Marmontel found this unnatural and distasteful. Amid
her liaisons Clairon had done much reading, and had become one of the
best-educated women of her day; her fame and esprit had won her
admission to cultivated society; she perceived that the emptiest vessels
were the most resonant. In 1752 an attack of syphilis compelled her to
withdraw for a time from the stage. Recovering, she accepted an
engagement to give thirty-five perform- ances in Bordeaux. On her first
night there, she tells us, she played Phedre</p>
<p>CHAP. IV ) THE ART OF LIFE 103</p>
<p>in the traditional manner, “with all the noise, fury, and unreason
which then</p>
<p>In 1763 Clairon went to Geneva to consult Dr. Tronchin. Voltaire
asked her to stay with him at Les Delices. “Madame Denis is ill; so am
I. Monsieu r Tronchin will come to our hospital to see the three of us.”
31 She came, and the old sage liked her so much that he lured her to
Ferney for a longer visit, and persuaded her to join him in several
performances in his theater. An old drawing shows him, in his seventieth
year, kneeling before her in a passionate avowal.</p>
<p>She retired from the stage in 1766, having already at forty- three
lost her health, and even the precision of her speech. Like Lecouvreur,
she fell in love with a dashing young noble; she sold nearly all her
possessions to rescue him from his creditors; he repaid her by giving
his love, and her livres, to other women. Then, aged forty-nine, she
received from the thirty-six-years-old Christian Friedrich Karl
Alexander, Margrave of Ansbach and Bayreuth, an invitation to live with
him at Ansbach as his mentor and mistress. She went (1773), and for
thirteen years she kept her hold on him. He had imbibed in France some
ideals of the Enlightenment; with her encouragement he ef- fected
several reforms in his principality — abolishing torture and
establishing religious liberty. Her final accomplishment was to persuade
him to sleep every night with his wife. In time Clairon grew bored, and
longed for Paris. The Margrave took her there occasionally; on one of
those trips he adopted a new mistress, and left Clairon in Paris,
handsomely endowed. She was now sixty-three.</p>
<p>She was welcomed in the salons, even by the virtuous Mme. Necker; she
gave lessons in elocution to the future Mme. de Stael. She took on new
lovers, including later the husband of Mme. de Stael herself, who was
glad to get rid of him. He set up the aging actress in comfort, but the
Revolution deflated her livres, and she lived in poverty until Napoleon
reinflated her pension in 1801. In that year a Citizen Dupoirier offered
her a last liaison. She discouraged him in a pitiful note that
summarizes the tragedy of many</p>
<p>104 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>an old actress: “It is likely that your memory still recalls me as
brilliant, young, and surrounded with all my prestige. You must revise
your ideas. I can scarcely see; I am hard of hearing; I have no more
teeth; my face is all wrinkled; my dried-up sk in barely covers my weak
frame.” 32 He came nevertheless, and they comforted each other by
recalling their youth. She died in 1 803 by falling out of bed.</p>
<p>She had long outlived the classic tragic drama whose greatest
eighteenth- century exponent, Voltaire, had acclaimed her as its supreme
interpreter. The Paris audience, predominantly middle-class, was
surfeited with the rhyming speeches of princes, princesses, priests, and
kings; those majestic alexandrines of Corneille and Racine, marching
pompously on six feet, seemed now to be a symbol of aristocratic life;
but were there none but nobles in history? Yes, of course, a Moliere had
shown those others; but that was in comedy; were there not tragedies,
profound trials and noble feelings, in the homes and hearts of people
without pedigree? Diderot thought the time had come for dramas of the
bourgeoisie. And whereas the nobility had shunned sentimen- tality, and
required emotion to wear a stately mask, the new drama, said Diderot,
should liberate feeling, and should not be ashamed to move audi- ences
to handkerchiefs and tears. So he, and some others after him, wrote
drames larmoy ants — weeping plays. Moreover, several of the new play-
wrights not only portrayed and exalted middle-class life, they attacked
the nobility, the clergy, at last even the government — its corruption,
taxes, lux- ury, and waste; they did not merely denounce despotism and
bigotry (Vol- taire had done this well), they praised republics and
democracy; and those passages were applauded with special warmth. 33 The
French stage joined a hundred other forces in preparing revolution.</p>

<li>MARMONTEL</li>
</ol>
<p>“Authors are everywhere,” wrote Horace Walpole from Paris in 1765,
and they “are worse than their own writings, which I don’t mean as a com
- pliment to either.” 34 Certainly the age could not compare, in
literature, with the age of Moliere and Racine, nor with that of Hugo,
Flaubert, and Balzac; in this brief period between 1757 and 1774 we
have, as memorable authors, only Rousseau and Marmontel, and the living
embers of Voltaire’s fire, and the secret, unpublished ebullience of
Diderot. Men and women gave them- selves so intensely to conversation
that their wits were spent before they took to ink. Aristocratic polish
was out of print; philosophy, economics, and poli- tics held the stage;
content now dominated form. Even poetry tended to propaganda; Saint-
Lambert’s Les Saisons (1769) imitated James Thomson, but denounced
fanaticism and luxury unseasonably, and, like Lear, thought of winter in
terms of icy blasts whistling about the hovels of the poor.</p>
<p>Jean-Frangois Marmontel owed his rise to his shrewdness, to women,
and to Voltaire. Bom in 1723, he wrote in his old age amiable Memoires
dHim pere (1804), which offer us a tender picture of his childhood and
youth.</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>IO5</p>
<p>Though he became a skeptic, and almost an idolator of Voltaire, he
had nothing but good to say of the pious people who had brought him up,
and of the kindly and devoted Jesuits who had educated him. He loved
these so much that he took the tonsure, aspired to join their order, and
taught in their colleges at Clermont and Toulouse. But like many another
fledgling of the Jesuits, he flew off on the winds of enlightenment, and
lost at least his in- tellectual virginity. In 1743 he submitted verses
to Voltaire, who so relished them that he sent Marmontel a set of his
works corrected in his own hand. The young poet kept these as a sacred
heirloom, and gave up all notions of a priestly career. Two years later
Voltaire secured a place for him in Paris, and free admission to the
Theatre-Frangais; indeed, in the hidden goodness of his parental-
childless heart, Voltaire sold Marmontel’s poems, and sent him the
proceeds. In 1747 Marmontel’s play Denys le Tyran (Dionysius)— dedicated
to Voltaire — was accepted and produced; it succeeded beyond his hopes;
“in one day I became famous and rich.” 35 Soon he was a minor lion in
the salons; he feasted on dinners and paid with wit, and found a route
to Clairon’s bed.</p>
<p>His second play, Aristomene, brought him more money, friends, and
mis- tresses. At Mme. de Tencin’s gatherings he met Fontenelle,
Montesquieu, Helvetius, Marivaux; at the table of Baron d’Holbach he
heard Diderot, Rousseau, and Grimm. Guided by women, he made his way up
in the world. Having praised Louis XV in clever verses, he was admitted
to the court. Pompadour was charmed by his handsome face and blooming
youth; she persuaded her brother to employ him as secretary, and in 1758
she made him editor of the official journal, Mercure de France. He wrote
a libretto for Rameau, and articles for the Encyclopedie. Mme. Geoffrin
liked him so well that she offered him a cozy apartment in her home,
where he remained for ten years as a paying guest.</p>
<p>To the Mercure he contributed (1753-60) a series of Contes moraux
(Moral Tales), which lifted that periodical into literature. Ex uno
judice omnes. Soliman II, tiring of Turkish delights, asks for three
European beau- ties. The first one resists for a month, yields for a
week, and is then put aside. Another sings beautifully, but her
conversation is soporific. Roxalana does not merely resist, she berates
the Sultan as a lecher and a criminal. “Do you forget who I am and who
you are?” he cries. Roxalana: “You are power - ful, I am beautiful; so
we are even.” She is not surpas singly beautiful, but she has a
retrousse nose, and this overwhelms Soliman. He tries every device to
break down her resistance, but fails. He threatens to kill her; she
proposes to spare him the trouble by killing herself. He insults her;
she insults him more cuttingly. But also she tells him that he is
handsome, and that he needs only her guidance to be as fine as a
Frenchman. He is offended and pleased. Finally he marries her and makes
her his queen. During the ceremony he asks him- self, “Is it p ossible
that a little turned-up nose should overthrow the laws of an empire?” 36
Marmontel’s moral: It is little things that cause great events, and if
we knew those secret trivia we should completely revise history.</p>
<p>Nearly everything prospered with Marmontel until he published
(1767)</p>
<p>106 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>a novel, Belisaire. It was excellent, but it advocated religious
toleration, and questioned “the right of the sword to exterminate
heresy, irreligion, and im - piety, and to bring the whole world under
the yoke of the true faith.” 37 The Sorbonne condemned the book as
containing reprehensible doctrine. Mar- montel appeared before the
Syndic of the Sorbonne and protested, “Come, sir, is it not the spirit
of the age, not mine, that you are condemning?” 38 The spirit of the age
showed in his boldness, and in the mildness of his punish- ment. Ten
years earlier he would have been sent to the Bastille, and his book
would have been suppressed; actually the sale of his novel proceeded fa-
mously, still bearing the “permission and privilege of the King”; and
the government contented itself with recommending that he should keep
silence on the matter. 39 However, Mme. Geoffrin was much disturbed when
the Sorbonne’s decree banning Belisaire was not only read in the
churches but posted on her door. She gently suggested that Marmontel
should find other lodgings.</p>
<p>He landed on his feet as usual. In 1771 he was appointed royal
historiogra- pher, with a good salary; in 1783 he became “perpetual
secretary” of the French Academy; in 1786 he was professor of history at
the Lycee. In 1792, aged sixty-nine and sickened by the excesses of the
Revolution, he retired to £vreux, then to Abloville; there he composed
his Memoires, in which even the Sorbonne was forgiven. He spent his
final years in uncomplaining pov- erty, grateful for having lived a full
and zestful life. He died on the last day of 1799.</p>
<p>V. THE LIFE OF ART</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sculpture</li>
</ol>
<p>The King had a fine taste in art; so did the lords and ladies of his
court, and the millionaires who were now itching to control the state.
It was an event in French history when the Sevres factories, which Mme.
de Pompa- dour had established, began in 1769 to produce hard-paste
porcelain; and though the Germans at Dresden and Meissen had done this
sixty years ear- lier, the Sevres products soon gained a European
market. Great artists like Boucher, Caffieri, Pajou, Pigalle, Falconet,
and Clodion were not above making designs for Sevres porcelain.
Meanwhile faience and soft-paste porce- lain of exquisite design
continued to come from the potters of Sevres, St.- Cloud, Chantilly,
Vincennes…</p>
<p>Potters, metalworkers, cabinetmakers, and tapestry weavers combined
their resources to adorn the rooms of royalty, nobility, and financiers.
Clocks, like that which Boizot designed and Gouthiere cast in bronze, 40
were a characteristic ornament of this age. Pierre Gouthiere and Jacques
Caffieri excelled i n “ormolu”— literally, “ground gold,” actually an
alloy composed chiefly of copper and zinc, carved and chased and inlaid
into furniture. The master cabinetmakers formed a proud and powerful
guild, whose members</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) THE ART OF LIFE IO7</p>
<p>were required to stamp their work with their names as an emblem of
re- sponsibility. The best of them in France came from Germany:
Jean-Frangois Oeben and his pupil Jean-Henri Riesener; these two joined
their skills in making for Louis XV (1769) a magnificent “Bureau du
Roi,” a rococo orgy of design, carving, inlay, and gilt, for which the
King paid 63,000 livres. It was enjoyed by Napoleons I and III, and was
surrendered to the Louvre in</p>
<ol start="1870" type="1">
<li>It is now valued at £ 50,ooo. 41</li>
</ol>
<p>In this age, which set such store by tactile values, sculpture was
esteemed at almost its classic estimate, for its essence was form, and
France was learn- ing that form, not color, is the soul of art. Here
again women outshone the gods; not in the natural imperfections of
reality, but in the ideal shapes and drapery that sensitive sculptors
could assemble and conceive. Sculpture em- bellished not only palaces
and churches but gardens and public parks; so the statues in the Jardins
des Tuileries were among the most popular figures in Paris; and
Bordeaux, Nancy, Rennes, and Reims emulated Paris in terra cotta,
marble, and bronze.</p>
<p>Guillaume Coustou II (only one year younger than the reign) now pro-
duced his finest work. In 1764 Frederick the Great commissioned him to
make statues of Venus and Mars; in 1769 Coustou sent them to Potsdam for
the Palace of Sanssouci. Also in 1769 he began the stately tomb of the
Dauphin and the Dauphine (parents of Louis XVI) for the cathedral of
Sens; on this he labored till his death (1777). In his last decades he
saw the rise of as brilliant a quartet of sculptors as France has fever
known: Pigalle, Falconet, Caffieri, and Pajou.</p>
<p>Failing to win the grand prix that paid for an art education in Rome,
Pigalle went there at his own expense, helped by Coustou. Returning to
Paris, he won admission to the Academie des Beaux-Arts with his first
chef- d’oeuvre, Mercure Attachdnt Ses Talonnieres ( Mercury Attaching
His Heelpieces). Seeing it, the old sculptor Jean- Baptiste Lemoyne
cried out, “Je voudrais r avoir fait!” (I wish I had done that! ) Louis
XV liked it, too, and sent it to his ally, Frederick II, in 1749.
Somehow it found its way back to the Louvre, where we may contemplate
the remarkable skill with which the young artist suggested the
impatience of the Olympian herald to be up and off. Mme. de Pompadour
found Pigalle’s work congenial, and gave him many commissions. He made a
bust of her, -which is now in the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art in New
York; and when her amour with the King subsided into friendship he
carved her likeness as Deesse de FAmitie ( 175 3). 42 He made a statue
of Louis as plain Citoyen for the Place Royale at Reims, and finished
Bouchardon’s Lou is XV for what is now the Place de la Concorde. He por-
trayed Diderot in bronze, as a man torn by conflicting philosophies. But
he let himself go histrionic in the tomb that he carved for the remains
of the Marechal de Saxe in the Church of St. Thomas at Strasbourg — the
amorous warrior striding to death as to a victory.</p>
<p>The most talked-of statue of this period was that which the
intelligentsia of Europe chose Pigalle to make of Voltaire. Mme. Necker
suggested it at</p>
<p>108 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>one of her soirees on April 17, 1770. All of her seventeen guests
(who in- cluded d’Alembert, Morellet, Raynal, Grimm, and Marmontel)
welcomed the proposal, and the public was invited to subscribe to the
cost. Some ob- jections were raised, for it was unusual to raise statues
to any living persons except royalty, and none had been made of
Corneille or Racine before their death. Nevertheless subscriptions
poured in, even from half the sovereigns of Europe; Frederick se nt in
two hundred louis d’or to commemorate his old friend and foe. Rousseau
asked permission to contribute; Voltaire objected; d’Alembert persuaded
him to consent. Freron, Palissot, and other anti - philosophes offered
their tribute, but were refused; the philosophes proved slower than
their opponents to forgive. As for Voltaire himself, he warned Mme.
Necker that he was no fit subject for statuary:</p>
<p>I am seventy-six years old, and I have scarcely recovered from a
severe malady which treated my body and soul very badly for six weeks.
M. Pigalle, it is said, is to come and model my countenance. But,
madame, it would be necessary that I should have a countenance, and the
place where it was can hardly be divined. My eyes are sunk three inches;
my cheeks are of old parch- ment, badly stuck upon bones that hold to
nothing; the few teeth I had are all gone. What I say to you is not
coquetry; it is pure truth. A poor man has never been sculptured in that
condition; M. Pigalle would believe that he was being played with; and
for my part I should have so much self-love that I should never dare to
appear in his presence. I would advise him, if he wished to put an end
to this strange affair, to take his model, with slight alterations, from
the little figure in Sevres porcelain. 43</p>
<p>Pigalle doubled the problem by proposing to make a nude statue of the
famous imp, but he was dissuaded. He went to Ferney in June, and for
eight days the bashful philosopher sat for him, on and off, but so
restlessly — dic- tating to a secretary, making grimaces, blowing peas
at various objects in the room — that the sculptor came close to a
nervous breakdown. 44 Returning to Paris with a mold, he labored on the
task for two months, and revealed the result on September 4; half the
elite came to marvel and smile. It is now in the vestibule of the
library of the Institute.</p>
<p>Pigalle’s only rival for sculptural primacy in this period was
Etienne -</p>
<p>Maurice Falconet, and Diderot tells us a pretty story of their
enmity. Two years younger, Falconet avoided direct competition at first
by making fig- ures in porcelain. Especially delightful was the
Pygmalion which Duru mod- eled after Falconet’s design, showing the
Greek sculptor’s astonishment as his marble Galatea bends to speak to
him. That figure could symbolize a half-forgotten truth: unless a work
of art speaks to us it is not art. When Pigalle was shown this bit of
clay transformed into enduring significance, he uttered the traditional
compliment of one great artist to another: “I wish I had done that!” But
Falconet, seeing Pigalle’s Louis XV Citoyen, did not entirely return the
compliment. “Monsieur Pigalle,” he said, “I do not like you, and I
believe you return my feeling. I have seen your Citoyen. It was possible
to create such a work, since you have done it; but I do not believe that
art can go one line beyond it. This does not prevent us from remaining
as we were.” 45</p>
<p>Falconet was soured by forty years of trials before full recognition
came</p>

<p>o him. He retired into himself, lived in Diogenic simplicity,
quarreled read- ily, belittled his own work, and expressed contempt for
fame, living or post- humous. Fame came at last with his Baigneuse ( 1
757) — a pretty bather trying the water’s temper ature with her toes. 46
Now Mme. de Pompadour warmed to him; for her he carved Amour Menagant —
Cupid threatening to loose an arrow infected with love. For a time
Falconet became the Boucher and Fragonard of sculpture, turning out such
charming titillations as Venus and Cupid, Venus Disrobing before Paris…
He excelled in designing can- delabra, small fountains, and figurines;
he carved in marble the Clock of the Three Graces now in the Louvre; and
he pleased Pompadour by representing her as Music. 47 In 1766 he
accepted Catherine II’s invitation to Russia; in St. Petersburg he
carved his masterpiece, Peter the Great on a prancing horse. He shared
with Diderot and Grimm the favor of the Empress; labored for her through
twelve years; quarreled with her and her ministers; left in a huff and
returned to Paris. In 1783 he suffered a paralytic stroke; during the
eight years that remained to him he kept to his room, confirmed in his
gloomy view of life.</p>
<p>Jean- Jacques Caffieri could be more cheerful, having been nursed
into suc- cess by his father, Jacques, one of the leading bronze workers
of the preced- ing age. He gained early entry into the Academy of Fine
Arts with his figure of an old man, clad only in whiskers, and entitled
Le Fleuve ( The River). The Comedie-F rangaise engaged him to adorn its
halls with busts of the French dramatists; he delighted everyone with
his idealized representations of Corneille, Moliere, and Voltaire. His
masterpiece is a bust of the play- wright Jean de Rotrou, which he made
from an engraving preserved in the family; it is d’Artagnan in middle
age— flowing hair, flashing eyes, pugnacious nose, bristling mustache;
this is one of the finest busts in sculpture’s history. Jealous of the
Comedie, the Company of the Opera persuaded Caffieri to portray their
heroes, too; he made busts of Lully and Rameau, but these have
disappeared. A lovely Portrait of a Young Girl remains, 48 perhaps a
member of the Opera ballet, a charming reconciliation of modest eyes and
proud breasts.</p>
<p>Mme. du Barry’s favorite sculptor was Augustin Pajou. After the
custom - ary novitiate in Rome, he achieved early prosperity with royal
commissions and orders from abroad. He made a dozen portraits of the new
mistress; the one in the Louvre has a classic costume wondrously carved.
At the King’s request he portrayed Buffon for the Jardin du Roi; 49 then
he commemorated Descartes, Turenne, Pascal, and Bossuet. His finest work
survives in the reliefs with which he adorned the lower tier of boxes at
the opera house in Versailles. He lived long enough to work for Louis
XVI, to mourn that King’s execution, and to watch Napoleon bestride the
Continent.</p>

<p>ude. The renewal of interest in Roman architecture by the excavations
at Herculaneum (1738) and Pompeii (1748-63) was nourishing a revival of
classical styles — lines of simplicity and dignity, facade of columns
and pedi- ment, and sometimes a spacious dome. J acques-F ranyois
Blondel, professor at the Academie Royale de l’Architecture, was all for
such classic forms, and his successor, Julien-David Le Roy, issued in
1754 a treatise, Les plus Beaux Monuments de la Grece, which accelerated
the intoxication. Anne-Claude de Tubieres, Comte de Caylus, after much
traveling in Italy, Greece, and the Near East, published (1752- 67)
seven epochal volumes, Recueil d’an - tiquites egyptiennes, etrusques,
grecques, romaines, et gauloises, carefully illustrated from some of his
own drawings; the whole world of French art, even of French manners, was
powerfully influenced by this book toward rejecting the irregularities
of baroque and the frivolities of rococo to seek again the purer lines
of classic styles. So in 1763 Grimm told his clientele:</p>
<p>For some years past we have been making keen inquiry for antique
monu- ments and forms. The predilection for them has become so universal
that now everything is to be done a la grecque , from architecture to
millinery; our ladies have their hair dressed a la grecque , our fine
gentlemen would think themselves dishonored if they did not hold in
their hands a little box a la grecque. 50</p>
<p>And Diderot, the apostle of bourgeois romanticism, suddenly
surrendered to the new wave (1765) on reading a translation of
Winckelmann’s History of Ancient Art. “It seems to me,” he wrote, “that
we must study the antique in order that we may learn to see nature.” 51
That sentence itself was a revolution.</p>
<p>In 1757 Jacques-Germain Soufflot began to build the Church of Ste.-
Genevieve, which Louis XV, when ill at Metz, had vowed to raise to the
patron saint of Paris as soon as he should recover. The King himself
laid the first stone, and the erection of thi s edifice “became the
great architectural - signed it in the form of a Roman temple, with a
portico of sculptured pedi- ment and Corinthian columns, and four wings
meeting in a Greek cross in a central choir under a triple dome.
Controversy marked almost every stage of the construction. Harassed and
disheartened by attacks upon his design, Soufflot died in 1780, leaving
the structure incomplete. The four piers de- signed by him to support
the dome proved too weak, and Charles-ttienne Cuvillier replaced them by
a much more beautiful circle of columns. This chef- d’oeuvre of the
classical revival was secularized by the Revolution; it was renamed the
Pantheon in memory of Marc us Agrippa’s masterpiece at Rome, as the
burial place “of all the gods” of the new order, even of Vol - taire,
Rousseau, and Marat; it ceased to be a Christian church, and became a
pagan tomb; it symbolized, in its architecture and its fate, the
progressive triumph of paganism over Christianity.</p>
<p>The classic style won another victory in the first Church of the
Madeleine (Magdalen), begun in 1764; colonnades and flat-ceiled aisles
took the place of arches and vaults, and a dome covered the choir.
Napoleon swept it away unfinished, to make way for the still more
classical Madeleine that occupies the site today.</p>

<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>I I I</p>
<p>This reversion to grave classic modes, after the rebellious
exuberance of baroque under Louis XIV and the playful elegance of rococo
under Louis XV, was part of the transition, under Louis XV himself, to
le style Louis Seize — the style of building, furniture, and ornament
that was to take the name of the guillotined King. Art disciplined
itself from incalculable curves and superfluous decoration to the sober
simplicity of straight lines and struc- tural form. It was as if the
decline of Christianity had taken the heart out of the Gothic
exaltation, and had left art no recourse but to a Stoic reserve shorn of
gods and clinging to the earth.</p>
<p>The greatest of French builders in this generation was Jacques- Ange
Ga- briel, whose ancestry had put architecture in his blood.
Commissioned by Louis XV (1752) to rebuild an old castle at Compiegne,
he graced the en- trance with a Greek portico of Doric columns, dentil
cornice, and unem- bellished balustrade. He followed similar designs in
rebuilding the right wing of the palace at Versailles (1770). To the
same palace he added (1753-70) an exquisite opera house. The flushed
columns, the delicately carved cornices and handsome balustrade, make
this one of the loveliest interiors in France. Tired of court publicity
and formality, Louis appealed to Gabriel to build him a petite maison
hidden in the woods; Gabriel chose a site a mile from the palace, and
raised there in French Renaissance style the Petit Trianon (1762-68).
Here Pompadour had hoped to enjoy privacy and ease; Du Barry romped
there for a while; then Marie Antoinette made it her favorite retreat as
the royal shepherdess in those happy, careless days when the sun still
shone upon V ersailles.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Greuze</li>
</ol>
<p>In the intimacy of aristocratic homes paintings were a favored
decoration. Statues were cold and colorless; they pleased the eye and
mind rather than heart and soul; paintings could reflect the flux of
moods and tastes, and they could transport the spirit to open spaces,
shady trees, or distant scenes while the body remained immured. So
Claude-Joseph Vernet pictured so many ships riding in French waters that
Louis XV, in a famous quip, thought it unnecessary to build more. The
French government hired Vernet to visit the ports and make paintings of
the vessels anchored there; he did, and made France proud of her fleets.
Diderot secured one of Vernet’s seascapes and landscapes, and prized it
so highly that he prayed to an extemporized God: “I abandon all to thee,
take all back; yes, all, except Vernet!” 53 — And there was Hubert
Robert, who w as called “Robert des Ruines” because he</p>
<p>equipped nearly all his landscapes with Roman ruins, like The Font du
Gard at Nhnes. Nevertheless, Mme. Vigee- Lebrun assures us, he was “very
much in demand” in Paris salons, though he was ruinously fond of eatin
g. 54 — And there was Fran£ois-Hubert Drouais, who preserved for us,
with sensitive portraiture, the loveliness of the Marquise de Sorau and
the innocent child- hood of the future Charles X and his sister
Marie-Adelai’de. 55 But let us look more intimately at Greuze and
Fragonard.</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste Greuze was the Rousseau and Diderot of the brush,
who</p>
<p>1 12</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>rosied his colors with sentiment, and made himself the Apelles of the
bour- geoisie. Sentiment is happier than sophistication, and not as
shallow; we must forgive Greuze for seeing and painting the pleasant
sides of life, for loving the gay gambol of children, the fragile
innocence of pretty girls, and the modest contentment of middle-class
homes. Without Greuze and Chardin we might have supposed that all France
was decadent and corrupt, that Du Barry was its model, that Venus and
Mars were its only gods. But it was the nobles who were decadent, it was
Louis XV who was corrupt; and it was the aristocracy and the monarchy
that fell in the Revolution. The masses of the people — excepting the
rural and city mobs — retained the virtues that save a nation, and
Greuze portrayed them. Diderot hailed Chardin and Greuze, not Boucher
and Fragonard, as the voice and health of France.</p>
<p>We have the usual stories about the artist’s youth: he wanted to
draw; his father forbade it as a cover for idleness; the boy crept from
his bed at night to draw pictures; the father, coming upon one,
relented, and sent him to study with an artist in Lyons. Jean-Baptiste
was not long satisfied with what he could learn there; he made his way
to Paris. He worked for some time in the poverty that tests young
talent. He had good reason later to show the better side of men, for,
like most of us, he found much kindness mingled with the busy
inattentiveness of the world. About 1754 an art collector, La Live de
Jully, bought Greuze’s Fere de Famille (Diderot used the same title
for</p>
<p>He was now thirty, and must long since have felt the magnetism of</p>
<p>woman; is not half of art a by-product of that irresistible force? He
experi- enced it in Rome to the point of agony. He was engaged to teach
drawing to Laetitia, daughter of a duke; she was in the full bloom of
youth; what could he do but fall in love? And he was handsome, with
curly hair and cheerful, ruddy face; Fragonard, his fellow student,
called him an “amorous cherub”; see in the Louvre his self -portrait in
old age, and imagine him at thirty; inevitably Laetitia, with blood that
could not count ducats, played Heloise to his Abelard, surgery omitted.
He took no advantage of her. She proposed marriage; he longed for her,
but realized that the marriage of a poor artist with the heiress of a
duke would soon be a tragedy for the girl; and, uncertain of his
self-control, he resolved not to see her again. She fell ill; he visited
and comforted her, but returned to his resolution. We are assured that
for three months he lay in bed with fever and frequent delirium. 56 In
1756 he returned to Paris, quite untouched by classic art or the
neoclassical revival.</p>
<p>“A few days after my arrival in Paris,” he tells us, “I happened to
be pass - ing, I know not by what fatality, down the Rue Saint- Jacques,
when I no- ticed Mile. Babuti at her counter.” 57 Gabrielle Babuti
worked in a book -</p>

<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>

<p>shop; Diderot had bought her books and “loved her well” (his words)
some years before. Now (1756- 57) she was “over thirty years old”
(Greuze’s account), and feared spinsterhood; she found Jean-Baptiste not
affluent but delectable; after he had paid her a few visits she asked
him, “Monsieur Greuze, would you marry me if I were willing?” Like any
decent French - man he replied, “Mademoiselle, would not any man be too
happy to spend his life with such a charming woman as you are?” He
thought no more of it, but she let the neighborhood understand that he
was her betrothed. He had not the heart to contradict her; he married
her, and for seven years they were reasonably happy. She had a luscious
beauty, and willingly served as his model in many poses that revealed
nothing but suggested all. She gave him in those years three children;
two survived and inspired his art.</p>
<p>The world knows him for his pictures of children. We must not expect
here the supreme excellence of Velazquez’ Don Balthasar Carlos 58 or Van
- dyck’s James II as a Boy ; 59 and we are sometimes repelled, in
Greuze’s girls, by an exaggerated and weepy sentiment, as in the Berlin
Portrait of a Maiden ; but why should we reject the curls and rosy
cheeks and wistful-trustful eyes of Innocence 60 or the unrouged
simplicity of A Young Peasant Girl ? 61 There is no pose in the Boy with
a Lesson Book ; 62 it is any lad weary of a task seemingly irrelevant to
life. Of 1 3 3 extant pictures by Greuze, thirty-six are of girls.
Johann Georg Wille, a German engraver living in Paris, bought as many as
he could of these childhood idealizations, and “held t hem more precious
than the finest paintings of the period.” 63 Greuze repaid the com -
pliment by portraying the unprepossessing Saxon as an exemplar of
virility. As these girls grow up in Greuze’s art they become more
artificial; La Laitiere ( The Milkmaid ) 61 is all dressed up as if for
a ball, and the lass of La Cruche Cassee ( The Broken Pitcher ) 65 has
no excuse (except beauty) for exposing a nipple on her way from the
well. But in a portrait of Sophie Arnould 66 the feathered hat, saucy
pose, and carmine lips seem all in char- acter.</p>
<p>Greuze was a minor Chardin touched with Boucher; a man honestly ad-
miring virtue and middle-class life, but dressing it up, now and then,
with a sensuous lure that Chardin would have shunned. When Greuze forgot
the flesh of his women he could achieve an idyl of bourgeois
domesticity, as in The Village Bride ( UAccordee de Village) 67
Exhibited in the final week of the 1761 Salon, it won the highest
honors, and became the talk of Paris. Diderot extolled it for its
emotion douce; and the Theatre des Italians paid it the unprecedented
compliment of representing it in a “living picture” on the</p>

<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>her chicks pecked for corn on the floor, or drank in safety from the
bowl at the father’s feet. The Marquis de Marigny bought the picture at
once, and the King later paid 16,650 livres for it to prevent its being
sold abroad. It is now in one of the less-frequented rooms of the
Louvre, spoiled by the de- terioration of its too superficial colors,
and passed by in the reaction of real- ism and cynicism against
optimistic sentiment.</p>
<p>Nearly all the artists of Paris felt that Greuze had lowered art by
making it preach through romances instead of revealing truth and
character with penetration and impartiality. Diderot defended him as
“the first of our a rtists who gave morals to art, and arranged his
pictures to tell a story.” 68 He mounted to exclamation points over the
tender tragedies that Greuze de- picted; “Delicieux! Delicieux!” he
cried over The Young Girl Weeping for Her Dead Bird. He himself was
campaigning for middle-class subjects and feelings in drama; he saw in
Greuze a precious ally, and praised him even above Chardin. Greuze took
him too seriously; he stereotyped himself as the apostle of virtue and
sentiment; he sent to Paris journals long expositions of the moral
lessons in the pictures that he was producing. Finally he wore out his
welcome with the art public, even while sentiment was the rising mood of
the age.</p>
<p>During all the twelve years since the acceptance of his candidacy for
the Academy, he had neglected to submit to it the historical picture
required for full membership. In the judgment of the Academy a genre
picture, describing domestic or everyday ’life, called for a less mature
talent than the imaginative reconstruction and competent representation
of some historical scene; hence it accepted genre painters only as
agrees (literally, agreeable), but not yet eligible to academic honors
or professorships. In 1767 the Academy an- nounced that Greuze’s
pictures would no longer be exhibited in the biennial Salon until he had
submitted an historical picture.</p>
<p>On July 29, 1769, Greuze sent in a painting of Septimius Severus
reproach- ing his son Caracalla for attempting to assassinate him. 69
The picture was shown to the members of the Academy. After an hour the
director informed him that he had been accepted, but added, “Monsieur,
you have been re - ceived into the Academy, but it is as a painter of
genre. The Academy took into consideration the excellence of your
previous productions; it has closed its eyes to the present work, which
is unworthy both of it and of you.” 70 Shocked, Greuze defended his
picture, but one of the members demonstrated the faults in the drawing.
Greuze appealed to the public in a letter to the Avant-Courier
(September 25, 1769); his explanation failed to impress con- noisseurs,
and even Diderot admitted the justice of the criticism.</p>
<p>Diderot suggested that the inadequacy of the painting was due to the
dis- turbance of the art ist’s mind by the collapse of his marriage. He
charged that Gabrielle Babuti had degenerated into an arrogant vixen,
exhausting her husband’s funds by her extravagance, wearing him down
with vexations, and destroying his pride by her repeated infidelities.
71 Greuze himself submitted to the commissioner of police (December n,
1785) a deposition charging his wife with persistently receiving her
lovers into his home and over his protests. In a later letter he accused
her of stealing large sums from him, and</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>”5</p>
<p>of attempting to “batter in my head with a chamber pot.” 72 He
secured a legal separation, took their two daughters with him, and left
her half his fortune and an annuity of i ,350 livres.</p>
<p>His character deteriorated under these blows. He became resentful of
any criticism, and lost all modesty in the exaltation of his pictures.
The public, however, agreed with his self-estimate; it flocked to his
studio, and made him rich with purchases of his paintings, and of the
prints derived from them. He invested his earnings in government bonds —
assignats; the Revolution left these bonds worthless, and Greuze found
himself a poor man, while the absorption of France in class violence,
political ecstasy, and the neoclassical reaction destroyed the market
for his pictures of domestic felicity and peace. The new government
rescued him moderately (1792) with a pension of 1,537 livres, but he
soon outran this, and appealed for an advance. A woman of the streets,
named Antigone, came to live with him and care for his failing health.
When he died (1805) nearly all the world had forgotten him, and only two
artists attended his corpse to the grave.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Fragonard</li>
</ol>
<p>Jean-Honore Fragonard survived better than Greuze the trials of
success, for he surpassed Greuze in both sensuality and technique. His
elegant art is the final exaltation of the woman of eighteenth-century
France.</p>
<p>Born at Grasse in Provence (1732), he carried the perfumes and
flowers of his birthplace into his art, along with the romantic love of
the trouba- dours; to which he added Parisian gaiety and philosophic
doubt. Brought to Paris at fifteen, he asked Boucher to take him as a
pupil; Boucher told him, as kindly as possible, that he took only
advanced students. Fragonard went to work for Chardin. In his off hours
he copied masterpieces wherever he could find them. Some of these copies
he showed to Boucher, who, much im- pressed, now accepted him as a
pupil, and enlisted his youthful imagination in making designs for
tapestry. The lad improved so rapidly that Boucher urged him to compete
for the Prix de Rome. Fragonard submitted an his- torical painting —
Jeroboam Sacrificing to the Idols. 73 It was a remarkable</p>
<p>At first he was discouraged by the masterpieces abounding there.</p>
<p>The energy of Michelangelo terrified me — I experienced an emotion
which I could not express; and on seeing the beauties of Raphael I was
moved to tears, and the pencil fell from my hands. In the end I remained
in a state of indolence which 1 lacked the strength to overcome. Then I
concentrated upon the study of such painters as permitted me to hope
that 1 might some day rival them. It was thus that Baroccio, Pietro da
Cortona, Solimena, and Tiepolo attracted and held my attention. 74</p>
<p>Il6 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Instead of copying Old Masters he drew plans or sketches of palaces,
arches, churches, landscapes, vineyards, anything; for already he had
acquired that skill with the pencil which was to make him one of the
most facile and finished draftsmen of an age rich in that basic art. #
Few drawings catch more of nature’s life than the green trees of the
Villa d’Este as seen by Fragonard at Tivoli. 75</p>
<p>On his return to Paris he set himself to satisfy the Academy with a
“his - tory” as the indispensable morceau de reception. Like Greuze he
found historical subjects uncongenial; present Paris with its entrancing
women drew him more powerfully than the past; the influence of Boucher
was still warm in his mood. After much delay he submitted Le Grand
Pretre Coresus Se Sacrifie pour Sauver Callirhoe; let us not stop to
inquire who this priest and maiden were; the Academy found them vivid
and well drawn, and granted Fragonard associate membership. Diderot
raved — “I do not believe that any other artist in Europe could have
conceived this painting”; 76 Louis XV bought it as a design for
tapestry. But Fragonard was finished with his- torical subjects; indeed,
after 1767 he refused to exhibit in the Salon; he worked almost wholly
on private commissions, where he could indulge his own taste, freed from
academic restraints. Long before the French romantics he rebelled
against the “brown sauce” of the Renaissance, and moved out gaily into
less charted seas.</p>
<p>Not quite uncharted. Watteau had opened the way with his radiantly
robed women starting out with easy conscience for Venus’ isle; Boucher
had followed with romping senses; Greuze had mated sensuality and
innocence. Fragonard combined them all: delicate raiment blowing in the
breeze; dainty tarts offering unimpeded sweets; stately ladies
hypnotizing men with the rustle of a dress or the fragility of a blouse,
or with some rhythmic grace or melting smile; and children plump and
rosy and tousle-haired, who had never yet discovered death. In his
drawings and miniatures he pictured almost every aspect of child life —
babes caressing their mothers, girls fondling their dolls, boys mounting
a donkey or playing with a dog…</p>
<p>Fragonard’s Gallic amorousne ss responded congenially to the requests
of aging courtiers and tired mistresses for pictures celebrating and
stirring the flesh. He ranged through the pagan mythology for goddesses
whose rosy bodies were immune to time; now it was Venus, not the Virgin,
who was raised in triumphant assumption to the skies. He stole half the
ritual of re- ligion for the ceremonies of love: The Kiss 77 is a
prayer, The Vow of Love is a sacred pledge, The Sacrifice of the Rose is
the ultimate offering. Among four pictu res painted by Fragonard for
Mme. du Barry’s chateau at Louve - ciennes one had a title that might
have covered half the artist’s work: V Amour Qui Embrasse I’TJnivers (
Love That Sets the World on Fire). He fingered the Gerusalemme liberata
to find the scene where nymphs flaunted their charms before the chaste
Rinaldo. He became the Boucher of the bed,</p>

<p>revealing women in half or all their nudity, as in La Dormeuse ( The
Sleeping Beauty ), La Chemise Enlevee ( The Blouse Removed), or La
Bacchante Endormie 79 Then, realizing that nudity can be disillusioning,
he returned from revelation to suggestion, and painted his most famous
picture, Les Hasards de I’Escarpolette ( The Hazards of the Swing ); 79
the lover gazes in delight at the mysteries of lingerie revealed as his
lady swings higher and higher, kicking one slipper with laughing abandon
into the air. — Finally, Fragonard could be Greuze, and even Chardin: he
pictured modest women, as in L’ Etude, La Lecture 99 and Les Baisers
Maternels; a nd in Mademoiselle Colombe he discovered that women have
souls.</p>
<p>In 1769, aged thirty-seven, he submitted to marriage. When Mile.
Gerard came up from Grasse to study art in Paris, she had only to name
her birth- place to win admission to Fragonard’s st udio. She was not
beautiful, but she was a woman in full bloom; and “Frago” (as he called
himself) decided, like Mme. Bovary, that there could not be much more
boredom in monogamy than in adultery. He found a new pleasure in working
together with her on such pictures as The Child’s First Steps, and
joining his signature with hers. When she bore their first child she
asked might she bring her fourteen-year- old sister up from Grasse to
help her with the infant and the house; he agreed, and for years this
menage lived in precarious peace.</p>
<p>Now he rivaled Greuze in portraying domestic life, and Boucher in
con- veying the tranquillity of rural scenes. He painted some religious
pictures, and made portraits of his friends. He was more constant as a
friend than as a lover, remaining always fond of Greuze and Robert and
David despite their success. When the Revolution came he dedicated a
patriotic picture, La Bonne Mere, to the nation. His savings were mostly
annulled by inflation and governmental defaults, but David, favorite
artist of the new era, secured his appointment to some minor sinecure.
It was about this time that he painted the remarkable self-portrait that
hangs in the Louvre: strong and burly head, white hair cropped close,
eyes still calm with confidence. The Terror frightened and disgusted
him, and he fled to his native Grasse, where he received shelter in the
home of his friend Maubert. He decorated the walls wi th panels
collectively known as Roman d’ Amour et de la Jeunesse (A Story of Love
and Youth). These he had intended for Mme. du Barry, but she, no longer
affluent, had refused them; now they are among the treasures of the
Frick Gallery in New York.</p>
<p>One summer day, returning hot and perspiring from a walk in Paris, he
stopped at a cafe and ate an ice. He was seized almost immediately by a
cerebral congestion, and died with blessed suddenness (August 22, 1806).
Grasse raised a pretty monument to him, with a naked urchin at his feet
and, behind him, a young woman swirling her skirts in a joyous
dance.</p>
<p>An artist must pay a price for symbolizing an age; his fame fades
with its passions, and can return only when the pathos of distance
ennobles him, or some turn in the tide brings a past mode into present
taste. Fragonard pros- pered because his art, desnuda or vestida,
pleased his time, soothing and grac- ing decay; but the stern code of a
Revolution fighting for its life against all</p>
<p>Il8 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>he rest of Europe needed other gods than Venus to inspire it, and
found them in the stoic heroes of republican Rome. The reign of woman
ended, the rule of the warrior returned. Greco-Roman models, redeified
by Winc- kelmann, served a new generation of artists, and the
neoclassical style swept away baroque and rococo in a tidal wave of
ancient forms.</p>

<li>Mme. Geoffrin</li>

<p>The reign of woman ended, but only after the zenith of the salons.
That unique institution reached its climax with Mme. Geoffrin, and
subsided in a fever of romance with Mile, de Lespinasse. It would revive
after the Revolu- tion, with Mesdames de Stael and Recamier, but never
again with the zest and fullness of the time when political celebrities
met on Saturdays at Mme. du Deffand’s, artists met on Mondays and
philosophers and poets on Wednes - days at Mme. Geoffrin’s, philosophers
and scientists on Tuesdays at Mme. Helvetius’ and on Sundays and
Thursdays at Baron d’Holbach’s, and literary and political lions on
Tuesdays at Mme. Necker’s, and any of these might meet any night at
Julie de Lespinasse’s. Besides these there were many minor salons: chez
Mesdames de Luxembourg, de La Valliere, de Forcalquier, de Talmont, de
Broglie, de Bussy, de Crussol, de Choiseul, de Cambis, de Mire- poix, de
Beauvau, d’Anville, d’Aiguillon, d’Houdetot, de Marchais, Dupin, and
d’Epinay.</p>
<p>It was not beauty that distinguished these Junos of the salons;
nearly all of them were middle-aged or older; it was that complex of
intelligence, tact, grace, influence, and unobtrusive money that enabled
a hostess to assemble women of charm and men of mind who could make a
gathering or causerie sparkle with wit or wisdom without setting it on
fire with passion or preju- dice. Such a salon was no place for
flirtations, or for erotic themes or double-entendres. 81 Every man
there might have a mistress, every woman a lover, but this was politely
veiled in the civilized give and take of courtesies and ideas. Platonic
friendships could find acceptance there, as with Du Def- fand and Horace
Walpole, or with Lespinasse and d’Alembert. As the Revo - lution neared,
the salons tended to lose their dispassionate elevation, and be- came
centers of revolt.</p>
<p>Mme. Geoffrin’s salon won the highest repute because she was the most
skillful of lion tamers among the salonnieres, allowed more freedom of
dis- cussion, and knew how — without appearing oppressive — to keep
liberty from passing the bounds of good manners or good taste. She was
one of the few women who rose from the middle class to maintain a
distinguished salon. Her father, valet de chambre to the Dauphine
Marie-Anne, had married the daughter of a banker; their first child,
born in 1 699, was Marie-Therese, who became Mme. Geoffrin. The mother,
a woman of culture with some talent for painting, laid great plans for
her daughter’s development, but died in</p>

<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>1700 giving birth to a son. The two children were sent to live with
their grandmother in the Rue St.-Honore. Half a century later, in reply
to Cath- erine II’s request for a brief autobiography, Mme. Geoffrin
explained her lack of erudition:</p>
<p>My grandmother… had very little education, but her mind was so ob-
servant, so clever, so quick, that… it always served her instead of
knowl- edge. She spoke so agreeably of the things she knew nothing of,
that no one desired she should know them better…. She was so satisfied
with her lot that she regarded education as superfluous for a woman. “I
have managed so well,” she said, “that I have never felt the need of it.
If my granddaughter is a fool, knowledge will make her self-confident
and unbearable; if she has wit and sense she will do as I did; she will
make up the deficiency by her tact and perception.” Therefore, in my
childhood, she taught me simply how to read, but she made me read a
great deal. She taught me to think, and made me reason; she taught me to
know men, and made me say what I thought of them, and told me how she
herself judged them…. She could not endure the ele- gancies that dancing
masters teach; she only desired me to have the grace which nature gives
to a well-formed person. 82</p>
<p>Religion, Grandma felt, was more important than education; so the two
orphans were taken to Mass every day.</p>
<p>Grandma attended also to Marie’s marriage. A wealt hy businessman,
Frangois Geoffrin, aged forty-eight, offered to marry the
thirteen-year-old girl; Grandma thought it a good match, and Marie was
too well brought up to object. She insisted, however, on taking her
brother with her to join M. Geoffrin in the comfortable home, also in
the Rue St.-Honore, which she was to keep to the end of her life. In
1715 she gave birth to a daughter, and in 1 7 1 7 to a son — who died at
the age of ten.</p>
<p>In that same fashionable street Mme. de Tencin opened a famous salon.
She invited Mme. Geoffrin to attend. M. Geoffrin objected; La Tencin’s
past had made some noise, and her favorite guests were such dangerous
free- thinkers as Fontenelle, Montesquieu, Marivaux, Prevost, Helvetius,
and Marmontel. Mme. Geoffrin went nevertheless. She was fascinated by
these untrammeled minds; how tiresome, by comparison, were the merchants
who came to visit her aging husband! He was sixty- five now, and she was
Balzac’s femme de trente ans. She too began to entertain. He objected,
she overruled him; finally he consented to preside at her dinners,
usually silent and always polite. When he died (1749), aged eighty-four,
her diners hardly noticed his absence. One who returned from a journey
inquired what had become of the old gentleman who had sat so
unobtrusively at the head of the table. Mme. Geoffrin answered softly,
“It was my husband. He is dead.” 83</p>
<p>Mme. de Tencin also completed her course in 1749, to the dismay of
her accustomed guests. We must record again the remark of the
ninety-two- year- old Fontenelle: “Such a good woman! [She had been a
veritable syn - thesis of sins.] What a worry! Where shall I dine on
Tuesdays now?” But he brightened up: “Well, on Tuesdays now I must dine
at Mme. Geof - frin’s.” 84 She was glad to have him, for he had been a
philosophe before Montesquieu and Voltaire, he had memories stretching
back to Mazarin, he</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>had seven years left in him, and could bear teasing without taking
offense, being hard of hearing. Most of the celebrities who had shone at
Tencin’s table followed his example, and soon the Geoffrin Wednesday
midday din- ners brought together, at one time or another, Montesquieu,
Diderot, d’Hol - bach, Grimm, Morellet, Raynal, Saint-Lambert, and the
witty little Neapoli- tan, Abbe Ferdinando Gahani, secretary to the
Neapolitan ambassador in Paris.</p>
<p>After her husband’s death, and despite her daughter’s scandalized
opposi - tion, Mme. Geoffrin all owed Diderot, d’Alembert, and Marmontel
to set the line and tone of discussion at her Wednesday dinners. She was
a patriot and a Christian, but she admired the courage and vivacity of
the philosophes. When the Encyclopedic was organized she contributed
over 500,000 livres to its costs. Her home became known as “the salon of
the Encyclopedic and when Palissot satirized the rebels in his comedy
Les Philosophes (1760), he made fun of her as Cydalize, the fairy
godmother of the coterie. There- after she asked her lions to roar more
courteously, and checked wild elo- quence with a deflating compliment —
“Ah, there’s something good!” 85 At last she withdrew her standing
invitation to Diderot, but she sent him a suite of new furniture and an
uncomfortably gorgeous dressing gown.</p>
<p>She discovered that artists, philosophers, and men of affairs did not
mix well; the philosophers liked to talk, the statesmen expected
discretion and good manners; the artists were a tempestuous tribe, and
only artists could understand them. So Madame, who collected art and had
caught some aes- thetic glow from the Comte de Caylus, invited the
leading artists and con- noisseurs of Paris to special dinners on Monday
evenings. Boucher came, La Tour, Vernet, Chardin, Vanloo, Cochin,
Drouais, Robert, Oudry, Nattier, Soufflot, Caylus, Bouchardon, Greuze.
Marmontel was the only philosophe admitted, for he lived in Mme.
Geoffrin’s house. The amiable hostess not only entertained these guests;
she bought their works, posed for their por- traits of her, and paid
them well. Chardin pictured her best, as a stout and kindly matron in a
lace bonnet. 86 After the death of Vanloo she bought two of his pictures
for four thousand livres; she sold them to a Russian prince for fifty
thousand livres, and sent the profit to the widow. 87</p>
<p>To round out her hospitality Mme. Geoffrin gave petits soupers for
her women friends. But no woman was invited to the Monday dinners, and
Mile, de Lespinasse (perhaps as d’Alembert’s alter ego ) was one of the
few women who came to the Wednesday soirees. Madame was somewhat pos-
sessive, and besides she found that female presences distracted her
lions from philosophy and art. Her policy of segregation seemed
justified by the high repute her assemblies gained for interesting and
significant discussions. Foreigners in Paris angled for invitations; to
be able to say, when they re- turned home, that they had attended Mme.
Geoffrin’s salon was a distinction second only to being received by the
King. Hume, Walpole, and Franklin were among her grateful guests.
Ambassadors to Versailles — even the lordly Count von Kaunitz — made it
a point to present themselves at the famous house in the Rue St.-Honore.
In 1758 Prince Cantemir, the Russian ambassador,</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>I 2 I</p>
<p>brought with him the Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, who told of the
accomplish- ments of her daughter; four years later this daughter became
Catherine II, and for many years thereafter the Empress of All the
Russias carried on a charming correspondence with the bourgeois
salonniere. A handsome and brilliant Swede who attended some of Madame’s
dinners went home to be Gustavus III.</p>
<p>A still handsomer youth, Stanislas Poniatowski, was a frequent
visitor, al- most a devotee of Mme. Geoffrin (who sometimes paid his
debts); 88 soon he was calling her Maman; and when he became King of
Poland (1764) he invited her to visit Warsaw as his guest. Though now
sixty-four years old, she accepted. She made a triumphal stay in Vienna
on the way: “I am better - ciety.” 90 When she came back to Paris and
resumed her dinners, a hundred celebrities rejoiced; Piron and Delille
wrote poems celebrating her return.</p>
<p>The trip had been arduous — riding in a coach through half the length
of Europe and back; Mme. Geoffrin was never again as alert and sprightly
as before. She who had once expressed her disbelief in life after death,
91 and had reduced religion to charity, now renewed her observance of
Catholic worship. Marmontel described her peculiar piety:</p>
<p>To be in favor with heaven without being out of favor with her
society, she used to indulge in a kind of clandestine devotion. She went
to Mass as secretly as others go to an intrigue; she had an apartment in
a nunnery,… and a pew in the church of the Capuchins, with as much
mystery as the galante women of that day had their petites maisons for
their amours. 92</p>
<p>In 1776 the Catholic Church announced a jubilee in which all who
visited certain churches at stated times would receive dispensations and
indulgences. On March 11 Mme. Geoffrin attended a long service in the
Cathedral of Notre Dame. Soon after reaching home she fell in an
apoplectic fit. The philosophes were angry that her illness should have
followed an act of wor- s hip; the mordant Abbe Morellet remarked, “She
has confirmed, by her own example, the maxim which she frequently
repeated: ‘One dies only through an act of stupidity.’” 93 The daughter,
Marquise de La Ferte - Imbault, took possession of her sick mother, and
warned the philosophes away. Madame never saw d’Alembert or Morellet
again; however, she ar - ranged that the pensions she had given them
should be increased after her death. She lingered on for another year,
paralyzed and dependent, but dis- tributing charity to the end.</p>

<p>There was only one salon in Europe that could rival Geoffrin’s in
fame and votaries. We have studied elsewhere the career and character of
Marie</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>de Vichy-Chamrond: how as a girl she dismayed nuns and priests with
her freethinking; how she wed the Marquis du Deffand, left him, and
solaced her solitude with a salon ( 1 7 39 f.’) , at first in the Rue de
Beaune, then ( 1 747 ) in the Convent of St. Joseph in the Rue
St. -Dominique. Her new site fright- ened away all but one of ^e
philosophes who had previously come to enjoy her wine and wit;
d’Alembert remained, being the least pugnacious of the tribe; for the
rest, her habitues were men and women of the aristocracy, who tended to
snub La Geoffrin as bourgeoisie. When the Marquise be- came blind at the
age of fifty-seven (1754), her friends still came to her dinners; but
during the rest of the week she felt loneliness with a rising
despondency, until she persuaded her niece to stay with her and serve as
assistant hostess at her soirees.</p>
<p>Julie de Lespinasse was the illegitimate daughter of the Comtesse
d’Albon and Gaspard de Vichy, brother of Mme. du Deffand. The Comtesse
ac- knowledged her, brought her up with her other children, gave her an
ex- ceptionally good education, and sought to have her legitimized; but
one of the daughters objected, and it was never done. In 1739 this half
sister mar- ried Gaspard de Vichy and went to live with him in the
Chateau de Cham- rond in Burgundy. In 1748 the Comtesse died, leaving an
annuity of three hundred livres for Julie, then sixteen. Mme. de Vichy
took Julie to Cham- rond, but treated her as an illegitimate orphan who
served as governess for the children. When Mme. du Deffand visited
Chamrond she was struck by the excellent mind and manners of Mile, de
Lespinasse; she won the girl’s confidence, and learned that she was so
unhappy in her present position that she had decided to enter a convent.
The Marquise proposed that Julie come and live with her in Paris.
Objections were raised by the family, in fear that Du Deffand would
arrange Julie’s legitimation, thus entitling her to a share</p>
<p>I shall introduce you as a young lady from my province who intended
to go into a convent, and will say that I offered you a lodging until
you should find one which would suit you. You will be treated with
politeness, and even with compliment, and you can count upon me that
your self-respect will never be offended.</p>
<p>However,… there is another point which I must explain to you. The
least artifice, even the most trifling little art, if you were to put it
into your conduct, would be intolerable to me. I am naturally
distrustful, and all those in whom I detect slyness become suspect to me
until I lose all confidence in them. I have two intimate friends —
Formont and d’Alembert. I love them passio nately, but less for their
agreeable charms and their friendship than for their absolute
truthfulness. Therefore you must, my queen, resolve to live with me with
the utmost truth and sincerity…. You may think that I preach, but I
assure you that I never do so except in regard to sincerity. On that
point I am without mercy. 94</p>
<p>In April, 1754, Julie came to live with Mme. du Deffand, first above
a car- riage shed, then in a room over the Marquise’s apartment in the
Convent of</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>I2 3</p>
<p>St. Joseph. Perhaps at Madame’s suggestion, the Due d’Orleans settled
upon her a pension of 692 livres. 95 She helped the blind hostess to
receive and place her guests at the salon assemblies; she brightened the
proceedings with her pleasant manners, her quick intelligence, her fresh
and modest youth. She was no beauty, but her bright black eyes and rich
brown hair made an arresting combination. Half the men who came there
fell half in love with her, even Madame’s old fa ithful chevalier,
Charles- Jean-Frangois Henault, president of the Court des Enquetes, who
was seventy, always ailing, always rubicund with a flow of wine. Julie
took their compliments with proper dis- count, but even so the Marquise,
doubly sensitive in her blindness, must have felt that some worship had
passed from her throne. Perhaps another element entered: the older woman
had begun to love the younger one with an affec- tion that would not
share. Both were vessels of passion, despite the fact that the Marquise
had one of the most penetrating minds of the time..</p>
<p>It was inevitable that Julie should fall in love. First (?) with a
young</p>
<p>Irishman of whom we know only the name Taaffe. Once admitted to the
salon, he came almost every day, and it was soon obvious to the Marquise
that he had come to see not her but Mademoiselle. She was alarmed to see
that Julie received his advances favorably. She warned Julie against
compro- mising herself. The proud girl resented the motherly advice.
Fearing to lose her, and anxious to protect her against an impetuous
attachment that prom- ised no permanence, the Marquise commanded Julie
to keep to her room when Taaffe called. Julie obeyed, but was so excited
by the quarrel that she took opium to calm her nerves. Many persons in
the eighteenth century used opium as a sedative. Mile, de Lespinasse
increased her doses with each new romance.</p>
<p>She learned to forget Taaffe, but her next love entered history, for
it fell upon the man whom Mme. du Deffand had taken to herself with a
mater- nal but possessive attachment. Jean Le Rond d’Alembert was in
1754 at the peak of his renown as mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
and collaborator in that Encyclopedic that was the talk of all
intellectual Paris. Voltaire, in a modest moment, called him “the
foremost writer of the century.” 98 Yet he had none of Voltaire’s
advantages. He was of illegitimate birth; his mother, Mme. de Tencin,
had disowned him, and he had not seen his father since childhood. He
lived like a simple bourgeois in the home of the glazier Rousseau. He
was handsome, neat, courteous, sometimes gay; he could talk with almost
any specialist on any subject, but he could also hide his learning
behind a fagade of stories, mimicry, and wit. Otherwise he made few com-
promises with the world. He preferred his independence to the favor of
kings and queens; and when Mme. du Deffand campaigned to get him into
the French Academy he refused to assure himself of Henault’s vote by
prais - ing Henault’s Abrege chronologique de Yhistoire de France
(1744). There was a strain of satire in him that made his wit bite now
and then; 97 he could be impatient, “sometimes violently choleric
against opponents.” 98 He never found out what to say or do when alone
with women; yet his shyness at- tracted them, as if by challenging the
efficacy of their charms.</p>
<p>When Mme. du Deffand first met him (1743) she was struck by the</p>
<p>I2 4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>range and clearness of his mind. She was then forty-six, he
twenty-six. She adopted him as her “wildcat” ( chat sauvage ) - 99
invited him not only to her salon but to private dinners tete-a-tete;
she vowe d her willingness to “sleep for twenty-two hours of the
twenty-four, so long as we pass the remaining two hours together.” 100
It was after eleven years of this warm friendship that Julie came into
their lives.</p>
<p>There was a natural bond between the natural son and the natural
daugh- ter. D’Alembert noted it in retrospect:</p>
<p>Both of us lacked parents and family, and having suffered
abandonment, mis- fortune, and unhappiness from our birth, nature seemed
to have sent us into the world to find each other, to be to each other
all that each had missed, to stand together like two willows, bent by
the storm but not uprooted, because in their weakness they have
intertwined their branches. 101</p>
<p>He felt this “elective affinity” almost at first sight. “Time and
custom stale all things,” he wrote to her in 1771, “but they are
powerless to touch my af - fection for you, an affection which you
inspired seventeen years ago.” 102 Yet he waited nine years before
declaring his love, and then he did it by in- direction: he wrote to her
from Potsdam in 1763 that in refusing Fred- erick’s invitation to become
president of the Berlin Academy of Sciences he had had “a thousand
reasons, one of which you haven’t the wits to guess” 103 — a strange
lapse of intelligence in d’Alembert, for was there ever a woman who did
not know when a man was in love with her?</p>
<p>Mme. du Deffand felt the growing warmth between her prized guest and
her guarded niece; she noticed, too, that Julie was becoming the center
of discussion and interest in the salon. For a while she uttered no
reproach, but in a letter to Voltaire (1760) she made some bitter
remarks on d’Alembert. She allowed a friend to read to her guests,
before d’Alembert had arrived, Voltaire’s reply, referring to these
remarks. D’Alembert came in soon after the reading had begun, and heard
the telltale passage; he laughed with the others, but he was hurt. The
Marquise tried to make amends, but the wound remained. When he visited
Frederick in 1763 his letters were almost daily to Mile, de Lespinasse,
seldom to Madame. After his return to Paris he fell into the habit of
visiting Julie in her apartment before they came down to the salon; and
sometimes Turgot or Chastellux or Marmontel accompanied him in these
intimate visits. The aging hostess felt that she was being be- trayed by
those whom she had helped and loved. Now she looked upon Julie as her
enemy, and she revealed her feelings in a dozen irritating ways — cold
tone, petty demands, occasional reminders of Julie’s dependence. Julie
grew daily more impatient with this “blind and vaporous old woman,” and
with the obligation to be always on hand or nearby to attend to the Mar-
quise at any hour. Every day increased her unhappiness, for each day had
its sting. “All pain strikes deep,” she later wrote, “but pleasure is a
bird of quick passage.” 104 In a final outburst Madame accused her of
deceiving her in her own home and at her expense. Julie replied that she
could no longer live with one who so considered her; and on a day early
in May, 1764, she left to seek other lodgings. The Marquise made the
breach irreparable by insisting</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>hat d’Alembert should choose between them; d’Alembert left, and never
returned.</p>
<p>For a time the old salon seemed mortally wounded by these
amputations. Most of the habitues continued to come to the Marquise, but
several of them — the Marechale de Luxembourg, the Duchesse de
Chatillon, the Comtesse de Boufflers, Turgot, Chastellux, even Henault —
went to Julie to express their sympathy and continued interest. The
salon was reduced to old and faithful friends, and newcomers who sought
distinction and good food. Madame described the change in 1 768:</p>
<p>Twelve people were here yesterday, and I admired the different kinds
and degrees of futility. We were all perfect fools, each in his kind….
We were singularly wearisome. All twelve departed at one o’ clock, but
none left a regret behind…. Pont-de-Veyle is my only friend, and he
bores me to death three quarters of the time. 105</p>
<p>She had never, since her light went out, had any love for life, but
now that her dearest friends were gone she sank into a hopeless and
cynical despair. Like Job, she cursed the day of her birth. “Of all my
sorrows my blindness and age are the least…. There is only one
misfortune,… and that is to be born.” 106 She laughed equally at the
dreams of romantics and philosophers — not only at Rousseau’s Heloise
and Savoyard Vicar, but at Voltaire’s long campaign for “truth.” “And
you, Monsieur de Voltaire, the declared lover of Truth, tell me in good
faith, have you found it? You com- bat and destroy errors, bu t what do
you put in their place?” 107 She was a skeptic, but she preferred genial
doubters like Montaigne and Saint-£vre- mond to aggressive rebels like
Voltaire and Diderot.</p>
<p>She thought herself finished with life, but life had not yet quite
finished with her. Her salon had a fitful resurrection during the
ministry of Choiseul, when the leading men in the government gathered
around the old Marquise, and the friendship of the kindly Duchesse de
Choiseul brought some bright- ness to darkened days. And in 1765 Horace
Walpole began to come to her gatherings, and gradually she developed for
him an affection that became her last desperate hold upon life. We hope
to meet her again in that final and amazing avatar.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Mile, de Lespinasse</li>
</ol>
<p>Julie chose as her new home a three-story house at the meeting of the
Rue de Bellechasse with the Rue St.-Dominique — only a hundred yards
from the Marquise’s conventual home. She was not reduced to poverty;
besides sev - eral small pensions, she had received pensio ns of 2,600
livres out of “the King’s revenues” (1758 and 1763), apparently at the
urging of Choiseul; and now Mme. Geoffrin, at d’Alembert’s suggestion,
dowered her with separate</p>
<p>Soon after settling in these new quarters Julie came down with a
severe case of smallpox. “Mile, de Lespinasse is dangerously ill,” wrote
David Hume</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>o Mme. de Boufflers, “and I am glad to see that d’Alembert has come
out of his philosophy at such a moment.” 108 Indeed, the philosopher
walked a long distance every morning to watch at her bed till late at
night, and then walked back to his own room at Mme. Rousseau’s. Julie
recovered, but was left permanently weak and nervous, her complexion
coarsened and blotched. We can imagine what this meant to a woman
thirty-two years old and still unmarried.</p>
<p>She was cured just in time to care for d’Alember t, who took to his
bed in the spring of 1765 with a stomach ailment that brought him near
death. Marmontel was shocked to find him living in a “little room ill
-lit, ill-aired, with a very narrow bed like a coffin.” 109 Another
friend, the financier Wate - let, offered d’Alembert the use of a
commodious home near the Temple. The philosopher now sadly consented to
leave the woman who had housed and fed him since his childhood. “Oh,
wondrous day!” exclaimed Duclos; “d’Alembert is weaned!” To his new quar
ters Julie commuted daily, repay- ing his recent care of her with her
own unstinted devotion. When he was well enough to move she begged him
to occupy some rooms on the upper floor of her house. He came in the
fall of 1765, and paid her a moderate rental. He did not forget Mme.
Rousseau; he visited her frequently, shared some of his income with her,
and never ceased apologizing for their separa- tion. “Poor foster
mother, fonder of me than of your own children!” 110</p>
<p>For a while Paris assumed that Julie was his mistress. Appearances
war- ranted the assumption. D’Alembert took his meals with her, wrote
letters for her, managed her business affairs, invested her savings,
collected her income. Publicly they were always together; no host
dreamed of inviting one with- out the other. Nevertheless it gradually
dawned even upon the gossipers that Julie was neither mistress nor wife
nor lover to d’Alembert, but only a sister and friend. She seems never
to have realized that his love for her, though he could not put it into
words, was complete. Mesdames Geoffrin and Necker, both of exemplary
morals, accepted the relationship as Platonic. The aging salonniere
invited both of them to both of her gatherings.</p>
<p>It was a severe test of Mme. Geoffrin’s mot herly kindness that she
made no known protest when Mile, de Lespinasse developed a salon of her
own. Julie and d’Alembert had made so many friends that within a few
months her drawing room was filled almost daily, from five to nine
o’clock, with chosen visitors, women as well as men, nearly all of fame
or rank. D’Alem - bert led the conversation, Julie added all the charms
of womanhood, all the warmth of hospitality. No dinner or supper was
offered, but the salon gained the reputation of being the most
stimulating in Paris. Here came Turgot and Lomenie de Brienne, soon to
be high in the government; aristo- crats like Chastellux and Condorcet,
prelates like de Boismont and Boisgelin, skeptics like Hume and
Morellet, authors like Mably, Condillac, Marmontel, and Saint- Lambert.
At first they came to see and hear d’Alembert; then to enjoy the
sympathetic skill with which Julie drew out each guest to shine in his
or her special excellence. No topics were barred here; the most deli-
cate problems of religion, philosophy, or politics were discussed; but
Julie —</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>I2 7</p>
<p>rained in this art by Mme. Geoffrin — knew how to calm the excited,
and return dispute to discussion. The desire not to offend the frail
hostess was the unwritten law that generated order in this liberty. At
the close of Louis XV’s reign the salon of Mile, de Lespinasse, in
Sainte - Beuve’s judgment, was “the most in vogue, the most eagerly
frequented, at an epoch that counted so many that were brilliant.”
111</p>
<p>No other salon offered such a double lure. Julie, though pockmarked
and fatherless, was becoming the second love of a dozen distinguished
men. And d’Alembert was at the height of his powers. Grimm reported:</p>
<p>His conversation offered all that would instruct and divert the mind.
He lent himself with as much facility as good will to whatever subject
would please most generally, bringing to it an almost inexhaustible fund
of ideas, anecdotes, and curious memories. There was no topic, however
dry or frivolous in itself, that he had not the secret of making
interesting…. All his humorous sayings had a delicate and profound
originality. 112</p>
<p>And hear David Hume, writing to Horace Walpole:</p>
<p>D’Alembert is a very agreeable companion, and of irreproachable
morals. By refusing offers from the Czarina and the King of Prussia he
has shown himself above personal gain and vain ambition…. He has five
pensions: one from the King of Prussia, one from the King of France, one
as a member of the Academy of Sciences, one as a member of the French
Academy, and one from his own family. The whole amount is not above six
thousand livres a year; on half of this he lives decently; the other
half he gives to poor people with whom he is connected. In a word I
scarce know a man who, with some few exceptions,… is a better model of a
virtuous and philosophical character. 113</p>
<p>Julie was at opposite poles to d’Alembert in everything but facil ity
and elegance of speech. But whereas the Encyclopediste was one of the
last heroes of the Enlightenment, seeking reason and measure in thought
and action, Julie, after Rousseau, was the first clear voice of the
Romantic move- ment in France, a creat ure (Marmontel described her) of
“the liveliest fancy, the most ardent spirit, the most inflammable
imagination which has existed since Sappho.” 114 None of the romantics,
in flesh or print— no Heloise of Rousseau nor Rousseau himself, no
Clarissa of Richardson or Manon of Prevost — exceeded her in keenness of
sensibility, or in the ardor of her inner life. D’Alembert was
objective, or tried to be; Julie was subjective to the pitch of a
sometimes selfish self- absorption. Yet she “suffered with those t hat
she saw suffer.” 115 She went out of her way to comfort the sick or ag -
grieved, and she labored feverishly to get Chastellux and Laharpe
elected to the Academy. But when she fell in love she forgot everything
and every- body else — in the first case Mme. du Deffand, in the second
and third d’Alembert himself.</p>
<p>In 1766 a young noble, Marques Jose de Mora y Gonzaga, son of the
Spanish ambassador, entered the salon. He was twenty-two, Julie was
thirty-four. He had been married at twelve to a girl of eleven, who died
in</p>
<ol start="1764" type="1">
<li>Julie soon felt the charm of his youth, possibly of his fortune.

of this,</li>

<p>128</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>his father ordered him to military duty in Spain. Mora went, but soon
re- signed his commission. In January, 1771, he began to spit blood; he
went to Valencia, hoping for relief; not cured, he rushed up to Paris
and Julie. They spent many happy days together, to the amusement of her
little court and the secret suffering of d’Alembert. In 1772 the
ambassador was recalled</p>
<p>Julie’s heart was torn by the news of Mora’s death, and all the more
be - cause she had in the meantime given her love to another man. In
September, 1772, she met Comte Jacques- Antoine de Guibert, twenty-nine,
who had made a notable record in the Seven Years’ War. Moreover, his
Compre - hensive Study of Tactics was acclaimed as a masterpiece by
generals and in- tellectuals; Napoleon was to carry a copy of it,
annotated by his own hand, through all his campaign s; and its
“Preliminary Discourse,” denouncing all monarchies, formulated, twenty
years before the Revolution, the basic principles of 1789. We can judge
the admiration that poured upon Guibert from a topic selected for
discussion in a leading salon: “I s the mother, the sister, or the
mistress of M. de Guibert to be most envied?” 117 He had, of course, a
mistress — Jeanne de Montsauge, the latest and longest of his amours.
Julie, in a bitter moment, judged him harshly:</p>
<p>The levity, even hardness, with which he treats women comes from the
small consideration in which he holds them…. He thinks them flirtatious,
vain, weak, false, and frivolous. Those whom he judges most favorably he
be- lieves romantic; and though obliged to recognize good qualities in
some, he does nor on that account value them more highly, but holds that
they have fewer vices rather than more virtues. 118</p>
<p>However, he was handsome, his manners were perfect, his speech
combined substance with feeling, and erudition with clarity. “His
conversation,” said Mme. de Stael, was the “most varied, the most
animated, and the richest that ever I knew.” 119</p>
<p>Julie considered herself fortunate in the preference that Guibert
showed for her gatherings. Fascinated by each other’s fame, they
developed what on his side became an incidental conquest, and on her
side a mortal passion. It was this consuming love that gave her letters
to Guibert a place in French literature and among the most revealing
documents of the time; there, even more than in Rousseau’s Julie, ou La
Nouvelle Heloise (1761), the proto - Romantic movement in France finds
its living expression.</p>

<p>THE ART OF LIFE</p>
<p>I2 9</p>
<p>Her earliest extant letter to Guibert (May 15, 1773) shows her
already in his toils. But she was torn with remorse over the violation
of her pledge of fidelity to Mora. So she wrote to Guibert, who was
leaving for Stras-</p>
<p>Ah, mon Dieu! by what charm, by what fatality, have you come to
distract me? Why did I not die in September? I could have died then
without… the reproaches that I now make to myself. Alas, I feel it, I
could still die for him; there is no interest of mine that I would not
sacrifice to him…. Oh, he will pardon me! I had suffered so much! My
body and soul were so exhausted by the long continuance of sorrow. The
news I received of him threw me into a frenzy. It was then that I first
saw you; then that you received my soul, then that you brought pleasure
into it. I know not which was sweetest — to feel it, or to owe it to
you. 120</p>
<p>Eight days later she took down all her defenses: “If I were young,
pretty, and very charming, I should not fail to see much art in your
conduct to me; but as I am nothing of all that, I find a kindness and an
honor in it which have won you right over my soul forever.” 121 At times
she wrote with all the</p>
<p>You alone in the universe can possess and occupy my being. My heart,
my soul, can henceforth be filled by you alone…. Not once has my door
been opened today that my heart did not beat; there were moments when I
dreaded to hear your name; then again I was brokenhearted not to hear
it. So many contradictions, so many conflicting emotions, are true, and
three words explain them: I love you. 122</p>
<p>The conflict of the two loves increased the nervous agitation that
perhaps had come from the starvation of her hopes for womanly
fulfillment, and from a growing tendency to consumption. She wrote to
Guibert on June 6, 1773:</p>
<p>Though your soul is agitated, it is not like mine, which passes
ceaselessly from convulsion to depression. I take poison [opium] to calm
myself. You see that I cannot guide myself; enlighten me, strengthen me.
I will believe you; you shall be my support. 123</p>
<p>Guibert returned to Paris in October, severed his relations with Mme.
de Montsauge, and offered his love to Julie. She accepted gratefully,
and yielded to him physically — in the antechamber of her box at the
opera (Feb- ruary 10, 1 774). 124 She claimed later that this, when she
was forty-two, was her first lapse from what she called “honor” and
“virtue,” 125 but she did not reproach herself:</p>
<p>Do you remember the condition in which you put me, and in which you
believed you left me? Well, I wish to tell you that, returning quickly
to myself, I rose again [italics hers], and I saw myself not one hair’s
-breadth lower than before…. And what will astonish you, perhaps, is
that of all the impulses that have drawn me to you, the last is the only
one for which I have no re- morse…. In that abandonment, that last
degree of abnegation of myself and of all personal interests, I proved
to you that there is but one misfortune on earth that seems to me
unbearable — to offend you and lose you. That fear would make me give my
life. 126</p>
<p>130 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. IV</p>
<p>For a time she experienced transports of happiness. “I have thought
of you constantly,” she wrote to him (for they kept their liaison
secret, and dwelt apart). “I am so engrossed in you that I understand
the feeling of the devotee for his God.” 127 Guibert inevitably tired of
a love that poured itself out so profusely, leaving no challenge to his
power. Soon he was paying at- tention to the Comtesse de Boufflers, and
resuming his affair with Mme. de Montsauge (May, 1774). Julie reproached
him; he replied coldly. Then, on June 2, she learned that Mora had died
on his way to her, blessing her name. She sank into a delirium of
remorse, and tried to poison herself; Guibert prevented her. Now her
letters to him were mostly about Mora, and how superior the young
Spanish nobleman had been to every other man she had ever known. Guibert
saw her less frequently, Montsauge more. Hoping to remain at least one
of his mistresses, Julie planned marriages for him; he rejected her
choices, and on June 1, 1775, he married Mile, de Courcelles, seventeen
and rich. Julie wrote him letters of hatred and disdain, ending with
protestations of undying love. 128</p>
<p>Through all the fever of her passion she was able to conceal the
nature of it from d’Alembert, who thought the absence, then death, of
Mora was its cause. He welcomed Guibert to her salon, developed a
sincere friendship for him, and personally mailed the sealed letters
which she wrote to her lover. But he noted that she had lost interest in
him, that at times she re- sented his presence. And indeed she wrote to
Guibert: “Did it not seem too ungrateful, I would say that M.
d’Alembert’s departure would give me a sort of pleasure. His presence
weighs upon my soul. He makes me ill at ease with myself; I feel too
unworth y of his friendship and his goodness.” 129 When she was dead he
wrote to her “manes”:</p>
<p>For what reason, which I can neither imagine nor suspect, did that
feeling, [once] so tender for me,… change suddenly to estrangement and
aversion? What had I done to displease you? Why did you not complain to
me if you had anything to complain of?… Or, my dear Julie,… had you done
me some wrong of which I was ignorant, and which it would have been so
sweet to pardon had I known of it?… Twenty times have I been on the
point of throwing myself into your arms, and asking you to tell me what
was my crime; but I feared that those arms would repulse me….</p>
<p>For nine months I sought the moment to tell you what I suffered and
felt, but during those months I always found you too feeble to bear the
tender re- proaches I had to make to you. The only moment when I could
have shown to you, uncovered, my dejected and discouraged heart was that
dreadful mo- ment, a few hours before your death, when you asked me, in
so heartrending a manner, to forgive you…. But then you had no longer
the strength to either speak to me or hear me;… and thus I lost, without
recovery, the mo- ment of my life which would have been to me the most
precious — that of telling you, once more, how dear you were to me, how
much I shared your woes, and how deeply I desired to end my woes with
you. I would give all the moments that remain to me to live, for that
one instant which I can never have again, that instant when, by showing
you all the tenderness of my heart, I might perhaps have recovered
yours. 130</p>
<p>The collapse of Julie’s dream helped tuberculosis to kill her.
Dr. Bordeu (whom we have met in Diderot’s Dream of d* Alembert) was
called in, and</p>

<p>pronounced her condition hopeless. From April, 1776, she never left
her bed. Guibert came to see her every morning and evening, and
d’Alembert left her bedside only to sleep. The salon had been
discontinued, but Con- dorcet came, and Suard, and the good Mme.
Geoffrin, herself dying. On the last days Julie would not let Guibert
come, for she did not wish to let him see how convulsions had disfigured
her face; but she sent him frequent notes; and now he too proteste d: “I
have always loved you; I have loved you from the first moment that we
met; you are dearer to me than anything else in the world.” 131 This,
and d’Alembert’s silent fidelity, and the solicitude of her</p>
<p>Her brother, the Marquis de Vichy, came up from Burgundy, and urged
her to make her peace with the Church. To the Comte d’Albon he wrote: “I
am happy to say that I persuaded her to take the sacraments, in spite
of, in the face of, the entire Encyclopedic.” 132 She sent a last word
to Guibert: “My friend, I love you…. Farewell.” She thanked d’Alembert
for his long devotion, and begged him to forgive her ingratitude. She
died that night, in the early hours of May 23, 1776. She was buried that
same day, from the Church of St.-Sulpice, and as she had desired in her
will — “like the poor.”</p>
