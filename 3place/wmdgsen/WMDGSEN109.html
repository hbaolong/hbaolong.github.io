<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>The Advancement of Learning</p>
<p>T he cultural activity of Periclean Greece takes chiefly three forms
— art, drama, and philosophy. In the first, religion is the inspiration;
in the second it is the battleground; in the third it is the victim.
Since the organization of a religious group presumes a common and stable
creed, every religion sooner or later comes into opposition with that
fluent and changeful current of secular thought that we confidently call
the progress of knowledge. In Athens the conflict was not always visible
on the surface, and did not directly affect the masses of the people;
the scientists and the philosophers carried on their work without
explicitly attacking the popular faith, and often mitigated the strife
by using the old religious terms as sym- bols or allegories for their
new beliefs; only now and then, as in the indict- ments of Anaxagoras,
Aspasia, Diagoras of Melos, Euripides, and Socrates, did the struggle
come out into the open, and become a matter of life and death. But it
was there. It ran through the Periclean age like a major theme, played
in many keys and elaborated in many variations and forms; it was heard
most distinctly in the skeptical discourses of the Sophists and in the
materialism of Democritus; it sounded obscurely in the piety of
Aeschylus, in the heresies of Euripides, even in the irreverent banter
of the conservative Aristophanes; and it was violently recapitulated in
the trial and death of Socrates. Around this theme the Athens of
Pericles lived its mental life.</p>
<p>I. THE MATHEMATICIANS</p>
<p>Pure science, in fifth-century Greece, was still the handmaiden of
philosophy, and was studied and developed by men who were philosophers
rather than scientists. To the Greeks higher mathematics was an
instrument not of prac- tice but of logic, directed less to the conquest
of the physical environment than to the mtellectual construction of an
abstract world.</p>
<p>Popular arithmetic, before the Periclean period, was almost
primitively clumsy.* One upright stroke indicated i, two strokes 2,
three 3, and four 4; 5, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 were expressed by the
initial letter of the Greek word</p>
<ul>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>

<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>for the number — deka^ hekatoTiy chilioiy myrioi. Greek mathematics
never achieved a symbol for zero. Like our own it betrayed its Oriental
origin by taking from the Egyptians the decimal system of counting by
tens, and from the Babylonians, in astronomy and geography, the
duodecimal or sexagesimal system of counting by twelves or sixties, as
still on our clocks, globes, and charts. Probably an abacus helped the
people with the simpler calculations. Fractions were painful for them:
to work with a complex fraction they reduced it to an accumulation of
fractions having i as their common numerator; so If was broken down into
i i</p>
<p>Of Greek algebra we have no record before the Christian era.
Geometry, however, was a favorite study of the philosophers, again less
for its practical value than for its theoretical interest, the
fascination of its deductive logic, its union of subtlety and clarity,
its imposing architecture of thought. Three problems particularly
attracted these mathematical metaphysicians: the squar- ing of the
circle, the trisection of the angle, and the doubling of the cube. How
popular the first puzzle became appears in Aristophanes’ Birds^ in which
a character representing the astronomer Meton enters upon the stage
armed with ruler and compasses, and undertakes to show “how your circle
may be made a square”— i.e., how to find a square whose area will equal
that of a given circle. Perhaps it was such problems as these that led
the later Pythagoreans to formulate a doctrine of irrational numbers and
incommensurable quantities.* It was the Pythagoreans, too, whose studies
of the parabola, the hyperbola, and the ellipse prepared for the epochal
work of Apollonius of Perga on conic sections.“* About 440 Hippocrates
of Qiios (not the physician) published the first known book on geometry,
and solved the problem of squaring the lune.t About 420 Hippias of Elia
accomplished the trisection of an angle through the quadratrbc curve.®
About 410 Democritus of Abdera announced that “in con - structing lines
according to given conditions no one has ever surpassed me, not even the
Egyptians;”* he almost made the boast forgivable by writing four books
on geometry, and finding formulas for the areas of cones and pyramids.*
All in all, the Greeks were as excellent in geometry as they were poor
in arith- metic. Even into their art geometry entered actively, making
many forms of ceramic and architectural ornament, and determining the
proportions and cur- vatures of the Parthenon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Irrational numbers are those that cannot be expressed by either a
whole number or a fraction, like the square root of 2. Incommensurable
quantities are those for which no third quantity can be found which
bears to each of them a relation expressible by a rational num- ber,
like the side and diagonal of a square, or the radius and circumference
of a circle, t A moonlike figure made by the arcs of two intersecting
circles.</li>

<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ANAXAGORAS</li>
</ol>
<p>It was part of the struggle between religion and science that the
study of astronomy was forbidden by Athenian law at the height of the
Periclean age.* At Acragas Empedocles suggested that light takes time to
pass from one point to another.* At Elea Parmenides announced the
sphericity of the earth, divided the planet into five zones, and
observed that the moon always has its bright portion turned toward the
sun.* At Thebes Philolaus the Pythagorean deposed the earth from the
center of the universe, and reduced it to the status of one among many
planets revolving about a “central fire.’” Leucippus, pupil of
Philolaus, attributed the origin of the stars to the in- candescent
combustion and concentration of material “drawn onward in the universal
movement of the circular vortex.”” At Abdera Democritus, pupil of
Leucippus and student of Babylonian lore, described the Milky Way as a
multitude of small stars, and summarized astronomic history as the
periodical collision and destruction of an infinite number of worlds.”
At Chios Oenopides discovered the obliquity of the ecliptic.”* Nearly
everywhere among the Greek colonies the fifth century saw scientific de-
velopments remarkable in a period almost devoid of scientific
instruments.</p>
<p>But when Anaxagoras tried to do similar work at Athens he found the
mood of the people and the Assembly as hostile to free inquiry as the
friend- ship of Pericles was encouraging. He had come from Clazomenae
about 480 B.C., at twenty years of age. Anaximenes so interested him in
the stars that when someone asked him the object of life he answered,
“The investi - gation of sun, moon, and heaven.”” He neglected his
patrimony to chart the earth and the sky, and fell into poverty while
his book On Nature was acclaimed by the intelligentsia of Athens as the
greatest scientific work of the century.</p>
<p>It carried on the traditions and speculations of the Ionian school.
The universe, said Anaxagoras, was originally a chaos of diverse seeds
{sper- mata), pervaded by a novs, or Mind, tenuously physical, and akin
to the source of life and motion in ourselves. And as mind gives order
to the chaos of our actions, so the World Mind gave order to the
primeval seeds, setting them into a rotatory vortex,* and guiding them
toward the development of organic forms.” This rotation sorted the seeds
into the four elements— fire, air, water, and earth — and separated the
world into two revolving layers, an outer one of “ether,” and an inner
one of air. “In consequence of this violent</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the Vortex that Aristophanes, in The CloudSy so effectively
satirized as Socrates* substitute for Zeus.</li>
</ul>
<p>340 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP, XV</p>
<p>whirling motion, the surrounding fiery ether tore away stones from
the earth, and kindled them into stars.’”* The sun and the stars are
glowing masses of rock: “The sun is a red -hot mass many times larger
than the Peloponnesus.”“ When their revolving motion wanes, the stones
of the outer layer fall upon the earth as meteors.“ The moon is an
incandescent solid, having on its surface plains, mountains, and
ravines” it receives its light from the sun, and is of all heavenly
bodies the nearest to the earth.” “The moon is eclipsed through the
interposition of the earth . . . the sun through the interposition of
the moon.”” Probably other celestial bodies are inhabited like the
earth; upon them “men are formed, and other animals that have life; the
men dwell in cities, and cultivate fields as we do.”” Out of the inner
or gaseous layer of our planet successive condensations pro- duced
clouds, water, earth, and stones. Winds are due to rarefactions of the
atmos phere produced by the heat of the sun; “thunder is caused by the
collision of clouds, and lightning by their friction.”” The quantity of
matter never changes, but all forms begin and pass away; in time the
moun- tains will become the sea.” The various f orms and objects of the
world are brought into being by increasingly definite aggregations of
homo- geneous parts {homoiomerid) “ All organisms were originally
generated out of earth, moisture, and heat, and thereafter from one
another.” Man has developed beyond other animals because his erect
posture freed his hands for grasping things.”</p>
<p>These achievements — the foundation of meteorology, the correct ex-
planation of eclipses, a rational hypothesis of planetary formation, the
dis- covery of the borrowed light of the moon, and an evolutionary
conception of animal and human life — made Anaxagoras at once the
Copernicus and Darwin of his age. The Athenians might have forgiven him
these apergus had. he not neglected his nous in explaining the events of
nature and history; perhaps they suspected that this nous, like
Euripides’ deus ex Tnachina, was a device for saving the author’s skin.
Aristotle notes that Anaxagoras sought natural explanations everywhere.”
When a ram with a single horn in the center of its forehead was brought
to Pericles, and a soothsayer interpreted it as a supernatural omen,
Anaxagoras had the animal’s skull cleft, and showed that the brain,
instead of filling both sides of the cranium, had grown upward towards
the center, an d so had produced the solitary horn.” He aroused the
simple by giving a natural explanation of meteors, and re- duced many
mythical figures to personified abstractions.”</p>
<p>The Athenians took him good-humoredly for a time, merely nicknaming
him nous.“ Bu t when no other way could be found of weakening
Pericles,</p>
<p>CHAP.XV) THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING 34I</p>
<p>Cleon, his demagogic rival, brought a formal indictment of impiety
against Anaxagoras on the charge that he had described the sun (still to
the people a god) as a mass of stone on fire; and pursued the case so
relentlessly that the philosopher, despite Pericles’ brave defense of
him, was convicted.*</p>
<p>The backwardness of the Athenians in astronomy was reflected in their
cal- endar. There was no general Greek calendar: every state had its
own; and each of the four possible points for beginning a new year was
adopted some- where in Greece; even the months changed their names
across frontiers. The Attic calendar reckoned months by the moon, and
years by the sun.®* As twelve lunar months made only 360 days, a
thirteenth month was added every second year to bring the calendar into
harmony with the sun and the seasons.® Since this made the year ten days
too long, Solon introduced the custom of having alternate months of
twenty-nine and thirty days, arranged into three weeks (dekades) of ten
(occasionally nine) days each;® and as an excess of four days still
remained, the Greeks omitted one month every eighth year. In this
incred- ibly devious way they at last arrived at a year of 365 K
days.J</p>
<p>Meanwhile a modest degree of progress was made in terrestrial
science. Anaxagoras correctly explained the annual overflow of the Nile
as due to the spring thaws and rains of Ethiopia.® Greek geologists
attributed the Straits of Gibritar to a cleaving earthquake, and the
Aegean isles to a subsiding sea.® Xanthus of Lydia, about 496, surmised
that the Mediterranean and the Red Sea were formerly connected at Suez;
and Aeschylus noted the belief of his time that Sicily had been tom
asunder from Italy by a convulsion of the earth.“ Scylax of Caria
(521-485) explored the whole coast of the Mediterranean and the Black
Sea. No Greek seems to have dared so adventurous a voyage of dis- covery
as that which the Carthaginian Hanno, with a fleet of sixty ships, led
through Gibraltar some 2600 miles down the west coast of Africa (ca.
490). Maps of the Mediterranean world were common in Athens at the end
of the fifth century. Physics, so far as we know, remained undeveloped,
though the curvatures of the Parthenon show considerable knowledge of
optics. The</p>

<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>Pythagoreans, towards 450, announced the most lasting of Greek
scientific hypotheses — the atomic constitution of matter. Empedocles
and others ex- pounded a theory of the evolution of man from lower forms
of life, and de- scribed the slow advance of man from savagery to
civilization.“</p>
<p>in. HIPPOCRATES</p>
<p>The epochal event in the history of Greek science during the
Periclean age was the rise of rational medicine. Even in the fifth
century Greek medicine was in large measure bound up with religion, and
the treatment of disease was still practiced by the temple priests of
Asclepius. This tem- ple therapy used a combination of empirical
medicine with impressive ritual and charms that touched and released the
imagination of the patient; pos- sibly hypnosis and some form of
anesthesia were also employed.“ Secular medicine competed with this
ecclesiastical medicine. Though both groups ascribed their origin to
Asclepius, the profane Asclepiads rejected religious aids, made no claim
to miraculous cures, and gradually placed medicine upon a rational
basis.</p>
<p>Secular medicine, in fifth-century Greece, took form in four
great</p>
<p>schools: at Cos and Cnidus in Asia Minor, at Crotona in Italy, and in
Sicily. At Acragas Empedocles, half philosopher and half miracle man,
shared medical honors with the rational practitioner Acron.“ As far back
as 520 we read of the physician Democedes, who, born at Crotona,
practiced medicine in Aegina, Athens, Samos, and Susa, cured Darius and
Queen Atossa, and returned to spend his last days in the city of his
birth.** At Crotona, too, the Pythagorean’ school produced the most
famous of Greek physicians before Hippocrates. Alcmaeon has been called
the real father of Greek medicine,*“ but he is clearly a late name in a
long line of secular medicos whose origin is lost beyond the horizons of
history. Early in the fifth century he published a work On Nature (peri
physeos) — the usual title, in Greece, for a general discussion of
natural science. He, first of the Greeks, so far as we know, located the
optic nerve and the Eustachian tubes, dissected animals, explained the
physiology of sleep, recognized the brain as the central organ of
thought, and defined health Pythagoreanly as a harmony of the parts of
the body.<strong> At Cnidus the dominating figure was Euryphron, who
composed a medical summary known as the Cnidtan Sen- tences, explained
pleurisy as a disease of the lungs, ascribed many illnesses to
constipation, and became famous for his success as an
obstetrician.</strong> An unmerry war raged between the schools of Cos
and Cnidus; for the</p>
<p>CHAP.XV) THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING 343</p>
<p>Cnidians, disliking Hippocrates’ penchant for basing “prognosis” upon
general pathology, insisted upon a careful classification of each
ailment, and a treatment of it on specific lines. In the end, by a kind
of philosophical justice, many of the Cnidian writings found their way
into the Hippo- cratic Collection.</p>
<p>As we see Hippocrates in Suidas’ thumbnail biography, he appears as
the outstanding physician of his time. He was born in Cos in the same
year as Democritus; despite their far-separated homes the two became
great friends, and perhaps the “laughing philosopher” had some share in
the secularization of medicine. Hippocrates was the son of a physician,
and grew up and practiced among the thousands of invalids and tourists
who came to “take the waters” in the hot springs of Cos. His teacher,
Herodi cus of Selymbria, formed his art by accustoming him to rely upon
diet and exercise rather than upon drugs. Hippocrates won such repute
that rulers like Perdiccas of Macedon and Artaxerxes I of Persia were
among his patients; and in 430 Athens sent for him to try his hand at
staying the great plague. His friend Democritus shamed him by completing
a century, while the great physician died at the age of
eighty-three.</p>
<p>Nothing in medical literature could be more heterogeneous than the
collection of treatises anciently ascribed to Hippocrates. Here are
text- books for physicians, counsels for laymen, lectures for students,
reports of researches and observations, clinical records of interesting
cases, and essays by Sophists interested in the scientific or
philosophical aspects of medicine. The forty-two clinical records are
the only examples of their kind for the next seventeen hundred years;
and they set a high standard of honesty by confessing that in sixty per
cent of the cases the disease, or the treatment, proved fatal.“ Of all
these compositions only four are by general consent from the pen of
Hippocrates — the “Aphorisms,” the “Prognostic,” the “Regimen in Acute
Diseases,” and the monograph “On Wounds in the Head”; the remainder of
the Corpus Hippo craticum is by a variety of authors ranging from the
fifth to the second century b.c.“ There is a fair amount of nonsense in
the assortment, but probably not more than the future will find in the
treatises and histories of the present day. Much of the material is
fragmentary, and takes a loose aphoristic form verging now and then upon
Heracleitean obscurity. Among the “Aphorisms” is the famous remark that
“Art is long, but time is fleeting.”“</p>
<p>The historical role of Hippocrates and his successors was the
liberation of medicine from both religion and philosophy. Occasionally,
as in the treatise on “Regimen,” prayer is advised as an aid; but the
page -by-page</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>tone of the Oillection is a resolute reliance upon rational therapy.
The essay on “The Sacred Disease” directly attacks the theory that
ailments are caused by the gods; all diseases, says the author, have
natural causes. Epilepsy, which the people explained as possession by a
demon, is not ex cepted: “Men continue to believe in its divine origin
because they are at a loss to understand it. . . . Charlatans and
quacks, having no treatment that would help, concealed and sheltered
themselves behind superstition, and called this illness sacred in order
that their complete ignorance might not be revealed.”® The mind of
Hippocrates was typical of the Periclean time spirit — imaginative but
realistic, averse to mystery and weary of myth, recognizing the value of
religion, but struggling to understand the world in rational terms. The
influence of the Sophists can be felt in this move for the emancipation
of medicine; and indeed, philosophy so powerfully affected Greek therapy
that the science had to fight against philosophical as well as
theological impediments. Hippocrates insists that philosophical theories
have no place in medicine, and that treatment must proceed by careful
observation and accurate recording of specific cases and facts. He does
not quite realize the value of experiment; but he is resolved to be
guided by e^erience.®</p>
<p>The natal infection of Hippocratic medicine with philosophy appears
in the once famous doctrine of “humors.” The body, says Hippocrates, is
com - pounded of blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile; that man
enjoys the most perfect health in whom these elements are duly
proportioned and min- gled; pain is the defect or excess of one “humor,”
or its isolation from the rest.® This theory outlived all the other
medical hypotheses of antiquity; it was abandoned only in the last
century, and perhaps survives by transmigra- tion in the doctrine of
hormones or glandular secretions today. Since the behavior of the
“humors” was considered subject to climate and diet, and the most
prevalent ailments in Greece were colds, pneumonia, and malaria,
Hippocrates (?) wrote a brief treatise on “Airs, Waters, Places” in
relation to health. “One may expose oneself confidently to cold,” we are
told, “except after eating or exercise. … It is not good for the body
not to be e^osed to the cold of winter.”“ The scientific physician,
wherever he settles, will study the effects, upon the local population,
of the winds and the seasons, the water supply and the nature of the
soil.</p>
<p>The weakest point in Hippocratic medicine was diagnosis. There was,
apparently, no taking of the pulse; fever was judged by simple touch,
and auscultation was direct. Infection was understood in the case of
scabies, ophthalmia, and phthisis.“ The Corpus contains excellent
clinical pictures</p>
<p>CHAP.XV) THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING 345</p>
<p>of epilepsy, epidemic parotitis, puerperal septicemia, and quotidian,
tertian, and quartan fevers. There is no mention in the Collection of
smallpox, measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, or syphilis; and no clear
mention of ty- phoid fever.“ The treatises on “Regimen” move towards
preventive medi - cine by advocating “prodiagnosis”— an attempt to catch
the first symptoms of a disease, and nip it in the bud.“ Khppocrates was
particularly fond of “prognosis”: the good physician, he believed, will
learn by experience to foresee the effects of various bodily conditions,
and be able to predict from the first stages of a disease the course
that it will follow. Most diseases reach a crisis in which either the
illness or the patient comes to an end; the almost P)rthagorean
calculation of the day on which the crisis should appear was a
characteristic element of Hippocratic theory. If in these crises the
natural heat of the body can overcome the morbid matter and discharge
it, the patient is cured. In any cure nature — i.e., the powers and
constitution of the body — is the principal healer; all that the
physician can do is to remove or reduce the impediments to this natural
defense and recuperation. Hence Hippocratic treatment makes little use
of drugs, but depends chiefly upon fresh air, emetics, suppositories,
enemas, cupping, bloodletting, fomentations, ointments, massage, and
hydrotherapy. The Greek pharmacopoeia was reassuringly small, and
consisted largely of pur- gatives. Skin troubles were treated with
sulphur baths, and by adminis- tering the oil of dolphin livers.“ “Live
a healthy life,” Hippocrates</p>
<p>advises, “and you are not likely to fall ill, except through epidemic
or acci - dent. If you do fall ill, proper regimen will give you the
best chance of recovery.”“ Fasting was often prescribed, if the strength
of the patient allowed; for “the more we nourish unhealthy bodies the
more we injure them.”” In general “a man should have only one meal a
day, u nless he have a very dry belly.”“</p>
<p>Anatomy and physiology made slow progress in Greece, and owed muck of
this to the examination of animal entrails in the practice of augury. A
little brochure “On the Heart,” in the Hippocratic Collection, describes
the ventricles, the great vessels, and their valves. Syennesis of Cyprus
and Diogenes of Crete wrote descriptions of the vascular system, and
Diogenes knew the significance of the pulse.® Empedocles recognized that
the heart is the center of the vascular system, and described it as the
organ by which the pneuma, or vital breath (oxygen?), is carried through
the blood vessels to every part of the body.® The Corpus, following
Alcmaeon, makes the brain the seat of consciousness and thought;
“Through it we think, see, hear, and distinguish the ugly from the
beautiful, the bad from the good.”®</p>

<p>Surgery was still for the most part an unspecialized activity of
advanced general practitioners, though the armies had surgeons on their
staffs.* The Hippocratic literature describes trephining operations, and
its treatment for dislocations of shoulder or jaw are “modem” in
everything except anes - thesia.“ A votive tablet from the temple of
Asclepius at Athens shows a folding case containing scalpels of various
forms.“ The little museum at Epidaurus has preserved for us ancient
forceps, probes, scalpels, catheters, and specula essentially like those
that are used today; and certain statues there are apparently models
illustrating methods for reducing dislocations of the hip.“ The
Hippocratic treatise “On the Physician” gives detailed directions for
the preparation of the operating room, the arrangement of natural and
artificial light, the cleanliness of the hands, the care and use of
instruments, the position of the patient, the bandaging of wounds,,
etc.“ It is clear from these and other passages that Greek medicine in
Hippoc- rates’ days had made great advances, technically and socially.
Heretofore</p>
<p>or at the patients’ homes.™ Women physicians were numerous, and were
usually employed for diseases of their sex; some of them wrote
authoritative treatises on the care of the skin and the hair.” The state
exacted .no public examination of prospective practitioners, but
required satisfactory evidence of an apprenticeship or tutelage to a
recognized physician.™ City govern - ments reconciled socialized with
private medicine by engaging doctors to attend to public health, and to
give medical treatment to the poor; the best of ’such state physicians,
like Democedes, received two talents (2,-</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>a year.™ There were, of course, many quacks and, as always, an in -
exhaustible supply of omniscient amateurs. The profession, as in all
gen- erations, suffered from its dishonest or incompetent minority ;™
and like other peoples the Greeks revenged themselves upon the
uncertainties of medicine by jokes almost as endless as those that wreak
their vengeance upon marriage.</li>

<p>Hippocrates raised the profession to a higher standing by his
emphasis on medical ethics. He was a teacher as well as a practitioner,
and the famous oath ascribed to him may have been designed to ensure the
loyalty of the student to his instructor.*</p>
<p>• The oath is regarded as deriving from the Hippocratic school rather
than from t he master himself; but Ejrodan, writing in the first century
as&gt;., attributes it to Hippocrates.“</p>
<p>CHAP.XV) THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING 347</p>
<p>The Hippocratic Oath</p>
<p>I swear by Apollo Physician, by Asclepius, by Hygiaea, by Pana-</p>
<p>cea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses,
that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this
oath</p>
<p>and this indenture. To hold my teacher in this art equal to my
own</p>
<p>parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need</p>
<p>of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own</p>
<p>brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it,
with-</p>
<p>out fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and
all</p>
<p>other instruction to my own sons, to the sons of my teacher, and</p>
<p>to indentured pupils who have taken the physician’s oath, but to</p>
<p>nobody else. I will use treatment to help the sick according to
my</p>
<p>ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-</p>
<p>doing. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked</p>
<p>to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not
give</p>
<p>to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and</p>
<p>holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even,</p>
<p>verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as
are</p>
<p>craftsmen therein. Into whatsoever houses I enter I will enter to</p>
<p>help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrongdoing</p>
<p>and harm, especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman,</p>
<p>bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of</p>
<p>my profession, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse</p>
<p>with men, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will
never</p>
<p>divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets. Now if I carry
out</p>
<p>this oath, and break it not, may I gain forever reputation among
all</p>
<p>men for my life and for my art; but if I transgress it and for-</p>
<p>swear myself, may the opposite befall me.”</p>
<p>The physician, Hippocrates adds, should maintain a becoming exterior,
keeping his person clean and his clothing neat. He must always remain
calm, and must make his behavior inspire the patient with confidence.”
He must</p>
<p>keep a careful watch over himself, and . . . say only what is
abso-</p>
<p>lutely necessary. . . . When you enter a sick man’s room, bear in</p>
<p>mind your manner of sitting, reserve, arrangement of dress, decisive
utterance, brevity of speech, composure, bedside manners . . . self-</p>
<p>control, rebuke of disturbance, readiness to do what has to be done.
… I urge you not to be too unkind, but to consider carefully your</p>
<p>patient’s superabundance or means. Sometimes give your services</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>for nothing; and if there be an opportunity of serving a stranger</p>
<p>who is in financial straits, give him full assistance. For where
there</p>
<p>is love of man, there is also love of the art.™</p>
<p>If, in addition to all this, the physician studies and practices
philosophy, he becomes the ideal of his profession; for “a physician who
is a lover of wis - dom is the equal of a god.”™</p>
<p>Greek medicine shows no essential advance upon the medical and surgi-
cal knowledge of Egypt a thousand years before the various Fathers of
Medicine; in the matter of specialization the Greek development seems to
have fallen short of the Egyptian. From another point of view we must
hold the Greeks in high esteem, for not until the nineteenth century of
our era was any substantial improvement made upon their medical practice
or theory. In general, Greek science went as far as could be expected
with- out instruments of observation and precision, and without
experimental methods. It would have done better had it not been harassed
by religion and discouraged by philosophy. At a time when many young men
in Athens were taking up with enthusiasm the study of astronomy and com-
parative anatomy, the progress of science was halted by obscurantist
legis- lation, and the persecutions of Anaxagoras, Aspasia, and
Socrates; while the famous “turning around” of Socrates and the Sophists
from the exter- nal to the internal world, from physics to ethics, drew
Greek thought from the problems of nature and evolution to those of
metaphysics and morals. Science stood still for a century while Greece
succumbed to the charms of philosophy.</p>
