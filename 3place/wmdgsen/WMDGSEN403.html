<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>XThe Intellectual Revolt</p>
<p>1300-1534</p>
<p>I. THE OCCULT</p>
<p>I N every age and nation civilization is the product, privilege, and
respon- sibility of a minority. The historian acquainted with the
pervasive</p>
<p>pertinacity of nonsense reconciles himself to a glorious future for
supersti- tion; he does not expect perfect states to arise out of
imperfect men; he perceives that only a small proportion of any
generation can be so freed from economic harassments as to have leisure
and energy to think their own thoughts instead of those of their
forebears or their environment; and he learns to rejoice if he can find
in each period a few men and women who have lifted themselves, by the
bootstraps of their brains, or by some boon of birth or circumstance,
out of superstition, occultism, and credulity to an informed and
friendly intelligence conscious of its infinite ignorance.</p>
<p>So in Renaissance Italy civilization was of the few, by the few, and
for them. The simple common man, named legion, tilled and mined the
earth, pulled the carts or bore the burdens, toiled from dawn to dusk,
and at evening had no muscle left for thought. He took his opinions, his
religion, his answers to the riddles of life from the air about him, or
inherited them with the ancestral cottage; he let others think for him
because others made him work for them. He accepted not only the
fascinating, comforting, in- spiring, terrifying marvels of the
traditional theology — which were daily reimpressed upon him by
contagion, inculcation, and art — but he added to them, in his mental
furniture, the demonology, sorcery, portents, magic, divination,
astrology, relic-worship, and miraclemongering that composed, so to
speak, a popular metaphysics unauthorized by the Church, which
deprecated them as a problem sometimes more troublesome then unbelief.
While the uncommon man in Italy was half a century or more ahead of his
class beyond the Alps in wealth and culture, the common man south of the
Alps shared equally with his transalpine peers the superstitions of the
time.</p>
<p>Often the humanists themselves surrendered to the genius or stultus
loci, and sprinkled their Ciceronian pages with the spirit or
foolishness of their</p>
<p>525</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xsurroundings. Poggio revels in portents and prodigies like headless
horse- men migrating from Como to Germany, or bearded Tritons rising
from the sea to snatch fair women from the shore. 1 Machiavelli, so
skeptical of re- ligion, suggest ed the possibility that “the air is
peopled with spirits,” and declared his belief that great events are
heralded by prodigies, prophecies, revelations, and signs in the sky. 2
The Florentines, who liked to think that the air they breathed made them
clever beyond compare, held that all im- portant events happened on
Saturday, and that it was a sure misfortune to march out to war by
certain streets. 8 Politian was so upset by the Pazzi conspiracy that he
attributed to it a disastrous rainfall that followed it, and condoned
the youths who, to end the rain, exhumed the corpse of the chief
conspirator, paraded it through the city, and then flung it into the
Amo. 4 Marsilio Ficino wrote in defense of divination, astrology, and
demonology, and excused himself from visiting Pico della Mirandola on
the ground that the stars were in an unfavorable conjunction 5 — or was
it a whimsy? If humanists could believe so, how could the people, with
no advantage of leisure or education, be blamed for thinking of the
natural world as the shell and instrument of numberless supernatural
powers?</p>
<p>The people of Italy reckoned so many objects as true relics of Christ
or the Apostles that one might have furnished from Renaissance Roman
churches alone all the scenes of the Gospels. One church claimed to have
a swaddling cloth of the Infant Jesus; another, hay from the Bethlehem
stall; another, fragments of the multiplied loaves and fishes; another,
the table used at the Last Supper; another, the picture of the Virgin
painted by angels for St. Luke. 8 Venetian churches displayed the body
of St. Mark, an arm of St. George, an ear of St. Paul, some roasted
flesh of St. Lawrence, some of the very stones that had killed
St. Stephen. 1</p>
<p>Nearly every object — every number and letter — was believed to have
some magic power. According to Aretino some Roman harlots fed to their
lovers, as an aphrodisiac, the rotting flesh of human corpses stolen
from the cemeteries. 8 Incantations were used for a thousand purposes;
by the proper one, said Apulian peasants, you could protect yourself
from mad dogs. Spirits beneficent or malevolent peopled the air; Satan
often appeared, in person or by deputy, to tempt or terrify, to seduce,
empower or instruct; demons had a fund of mystic knowledge that could be
tapped if one should properly propitiate them. Some Carmelite monks at
Bologna (till Sixtus IV condemned them in 1474) taught that there was no
harm in seeking knowl- edge from devils; 9 and professional sorcerers
offered their expert charms in invoking the aid of demons for paying
customers. Witches — sorcerers</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 527</p>
<p>usually female — were believed to have special access to such helpful
devils, whom they treated as lovers and gods; by delegated demonic power
these women, in the belief of the people, could foresee the future, fly
in a mo- ment over long distances, pass through closed gates and doors,
and wreak dire evils upon persons who offended them; they could induce
love or hate, produce abortion, manufacture poisons, and cause death by
a spell or a glance.</p>
<p>In 1484 a bull of Innocent VIII ( Surnmis desiderantes ) forbade
resort to witches, took for granted the reality of some of their claimed
powers, ascribed to them some storms and plagues, and complained that
many Christians, falling away from orthodox worship, had contracted
carnal union with devils, and, by spells and magic rhymes, curses and
other di- abolical arts, had done grievous harm to men, women, children,
and beasts. 10 The Pope advised the officers of the Inquisition to be on
the alert against such practices. The bull did not impose belief in
witchcraft as the official doctrine of the Church, nor did it inaugurate
the prosecution of witches; popular belief in witches, and occasional
punishment of them, long ante- dated the bull. The Pope was here
faithful to the Old Testament, which had commanded, “Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.” 11 The Church had for centuries maintained the
possibility of demonic influences upon human beings; 12 but the Pope’s
assumption of the reality of witchcraft encouraged</p>
<p>Whether through perverse stimulation by persecution, or from other
causes, the number of persons who believed themselves, or were believed,
to have practised witchcraft rapidly increased, especially in subalpine
Italy; it took on the nature and proportions of an epidemic; popular
report claimed that 25 ,000 persons had attended a “witches’ sabbath” on
a plain near Brescia. In 1518 the inquisitors burned seventy alleged
witches from that region, and had thousands of suspects in their
prisons. The Signory of Brescia protested against this wholesale
detention, and interfered with further executions; whereupon Leo X, in a
bull Honestis (February 15,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>X1521), ordered the excommunication of any officials, and the
suspension of religious services in any community, that refused to
execute, without ex- amination or revision, the sentences of the
inquisitors. The Signory, ig- noring the bull, appointed two bishops,
two Brescian physicians, and one inquisitor to supervise all further
witchcraft trials, and to inquire into the justice of previous
condemnations; only these men were to have the power to condemn the
accused. The Signory admonished the papal legate to put an end to the
condemnation of persons for the sake of confiscating their property. 16
* It was a brave procedure; but ignorance and sadism got the upper hand,
and in the next two centuries, in Protestant as well as Catholic lands,
in the New World as well as the old, burnings for witchcraft were to
form the darkest spots in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>The mania to know the future supported the usual variety of fortune-
tellers — palmists, dream interpreters, astrologers; these last were
more nu- merous and powerful in Italy than in the rest of Europe. Almost
every Italian government had an official astrologer, who determined the
celestially propitious times when important enterprises should commence.
Julius II would not leave Bologna till his astrologer marked the time as
auspicious; Sixtus IV and Paul III let their stargazers fix the hours of
their major con- ferences. 16b So general was the belief that the stars
governed human char- acter and affairs that many university professors
in Italy annually issued iudicia — predictions based on astrology; 16 ’
it was one of Aretino’s humorous devices t o parody these learned
almanacs. When Lorenzo de’ Medici re - established the University of
Pisa he made no arrangements for a course in astrology, but the students
clamored for it, and he had to yield. 16 “ In Lorenzo’s erudite circle
Pico della Mirando la wrote a powerful attack upon astrology, but
Marsilio Ficino, still more learned, defended it. “How happy are the
astrologers!” exclaimed Guicciardini, “who are believed if they tell one
truth to a hundred lies, while other people lose all credit if they tell
one lie to a hundred truths.” 16 ’ Yet astrology had in it a certain
groping toward</p>

</ol>
<p>The superstitions of the people, rather than the opposition of the
Church, retarded the development of science. Censorship of publications
did not</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 529</p>
<p>become a substantial hindrance to science until the Counter
Reformation that followed the Council of Trent (1545^. Sixtus IV brought
to Rome (1463) the most famous astronomer of the fifteenth century,
Johann Muller “Regiomontanus.” During Alexander’s pontificate Copernicus
taught mathematics and astronomy in the University of Rome. Copernicus
had not yet come to his world- shaking theory of the earth’s orbital
revolu - tion, but Nicholas of Cusa had already suggested it; and both
men were churchmen. Throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
the In- quisition was relatively weak in Italy, partly through the
absence of the popes in Avignon, their quarrels in the Schism, and their
infection with the enlightenment of the Renaissance. In 1440 the
materialist Amadeo de’ Landi was tried by the Inquisition at Milan, and
was acquitted; in 1497 Gabriele da Salo, a freethinking physician, was
protected from the Inquisi- tion by his patron, though “he was in the
habit of maintaining that Christ was not God but the son of J oseph.” 16
’ Despite the Inquisition, thought was freer in Italy, and education
more advanced, than in any other country in the fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries. Her schools of astronomy, law, medicine, and
literature were the goals of students from a dozen lands. Thomas
Linacre, English physician and scholar, after completing his uni-
versity courses in Italy, set up an altar in the Italian Alps as he was
return- ing to England, and, taking a last view of Italy, dedicated the
altar to her as Alma mater studiorum, the fostering mother of studies,
the postgraduate university of the Christian world.</p>
<p>If, in this atmosphere of superstition beneath and liberalism above,
science made only modest advances in the two centuries before Vesalius (
1 5 14-64) , it was largely because patronage and honor went to art,
scholarship, and poetry, and there was as yet no clear call, in the
economic or intellectual life of Italy, for scientific methods and
ideas. A man like Leonardo could take a sweeping cosmic view, and touch
a dozen sciences with eager curi- osity; but there were no great
laboratories, dissection was only beginning, no miscroscope could help
biology or medicine, no telescope could yet en- large the stars and
bring the moon to the edge of the earth. The medieval love of beauty had
matured into magnificent art; but there had been little medieval love of
truth to grow into science; and the recovery of ancient literature
stimulated a skeptical epicureanism idealizing antiquity rather than a
stoic devotion to scientific research aiming to mold the future. The
Renaissance gave its soul to art, leaving a little for literature, less
for phi- losophy, least for science. In this sense it lacked the
multiform mental ac-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>53 °</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xtivity of the Greek heyday from Pericles and Aeschylus to Zeno the
Stoic and Aristarchus the astronomer. Science could not advance until
philoso- phy had cleared the way.</p>
<p>Therefore it is natural that the same reader who knows by name a
dozen Renaissance artists will find it hard to recall one Renaissance
Italian scientist, barring Leonardo; even of Amerigo Vespucci he will
have to be reminded; and Galileo ( 1 564-1 642 ) belongs to the
seventeenth century. In truth there were no memorable names except in
geography and medicine. Oderic of Pordenone went to India and China as a
missionary ( c . 1321), returned via Tibet and Persia, and wrote an
account of what he had seen, adding much of value to what Marco Polo had
reported a generation before. Paolo Toscanelli, astronomer, physician,
and geographer, noted Halley’s comet in 1456, and is reputed to have
given Columbus knowledge and encourage- ment for his Atlantic venture.
16 ’ Amerigo Vespucci of Florence made four voyages to the New World
(1497^, claimed to have been the first to dis- cover the mainland, and
prepared maps of it; Martin Waldseemiiller, pub- lishing them, suggested
that the continent be called America; the Italians liked the idea, and
popularized it -in their writings. 1 ® 1</p>
<p>The biological sciences were the last to develop, for the theory of
the special creation of man — almost universally accepted — made it
unnecessary and dangerous to inquire into his natural origin. For the
most part these sciences limited themselves to practical pursuits and
studies in medical botany, horticulture, floriculture, and agriculture.

<li>MEDICINE</li>
</ol>
<p>The most prosperous science was medicine, for men will sacrifice any-
thing but appetite for health. Physicians received a stimulating share
of Italy’s new wealth. Padua paid one of them two thousand ducats a year
to serve as consultant, while leaving him free to charge for his private
prac- tice. 161 Petrarch, standing on his benefices, indignantly
denounced the high</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 53 1</p>
<p>fees of physicians, their robes of scarlet and their miniver hoods,
161 their sparkling rings and golden spurs. He earnestly warned the sick
Pope Clement VI against trusting physicians:</p>
<p>I know that your bedside is beleaguered by doctors, and naturally</p>
<p>this fills me with fear. Their opinions are always conflicting, and
he</p>
<p>who has nothing new to say suffers the shame of limping behind the
others. As Pliny said, in order to make a name for themselves</p>
<p>through some novelty, they traffic with our lives. With them —
not</p>
<p>as with other trades — it is sufficient to be called a physician to
be be- lieved to the last word, and yet a physician’s lie harbors more
danger than any other. Only sweet hope causes us not to think of the
situa- tion. They learn their art at our expense, and even our death
brings</p>
<p>them experience; the physician alone has the right to kill with
im-</p>
<p>punity. Oh, Most Gentle Father, look upon their band as an army
of</p>
<p>enemies. Remember the warning epitaph which an unfortunate man had
inscribed on his tombstone: “I died of too many physicians.” 17</p>
<p>In all civilized lands and times physicians have rivaled women for
the dis- tinction of being the most desirable and satirized of
mankind.</p>
<p>The basis of progress in medicine was the renaissance of anatomy. Ec-
clesiastics, co-operating with physicians as well as with artists,
sometimes provided corpses for dissection from the hospitals that they
controlled. Mondino de’ Luzzi dissected cadavers at Bologna, and wrote
an Anatomia (1316) which remained a classic text for three centuries.
Nevertheless corpses were hard to get. In 1319 some medical students at
Bologna stole a corpse from a cemetery and brought it to a teacher at
the University, who dissected it for their instruction. The students
were prosecuted but ac- quitted, and from that time the civil
authorities winked an eye at the use of executed and unclaimed criminals
in “anatomies.” 18 Beren gario da Carpi (1470-1550), professor of
anatomy at Bologna, was credited with having dissected over a hundred
corpses. 19 Dissection was practised at the Uni- versity of Pisa at
least as early as 1341; soon it was permitted in all the medical schools
of Italy, including the papal school of medicine in Rome. Sixtus IV
(1471-84) officially authorized such dissections. 20</p>
<p>Slowly Renaissance anatomy regained its forgotten classic heritage.
Men like Antonio Benivieni, Alessandro Achillini, Alessandro Benedetti,
and Marcantonio della Torre liberated anatomy from Arabic tutelage, went
back to Galen and Hippocrates, questioned even these sacred authorities,
and added, nerve by nerve, muscle by muscle, and bone by bone, to the
scientific knowledge of the body. Benivieni directed his anatomies to
find-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xmg the internal causes of disease; his treatise On Several Hidden
and Won- derful Causes of Disease and Cures (De abditis nonnullis ac
mirandis mor- borum et sanationum causis, 1507) founded pathological
anatomy, and made post-mortem examinations a main factor in the
development of mod- ern medicine. Meanwhile the new art of printing
accelerated medical prog- ress by facilitating the diffusion and
international exchange of medical texts.</p>
<p>We may loosely estimate the medieval relapse of medical science in
Latin Christendom by noting that the most advanced anatomists and
physicians of this age had barely reached, by 1500, the knowledge
possessed by Hip- pocrates, Galen, and Soranus in the period from 450
b.c. to a.d. 200. Treat- ment was still based on the Hippocratic theory
of humors, and bloodletting was a panacea. The first known transfusion
of human blood was attempted by a Jewish physician in the case of Pope
Innocent VIII (1492); as we have seen, it failed. Exorcists were still
called in to treat impotence and amnesia by religious incantations or
the kissing of relics, perhaps because such suggestive therapy was found
occasionally helpful. Strange pills and drugs were sold by apothecaries,
who added to their incomes by including stationery, varnish,
confectionery, spices, and jewelry among-their wares. 21 Michele
Savonarola, father of the fiery friar, wrote a Practica medicinae ( c .
1440), and some shorter treatises; one of these discussed the frequency
of mental pathology ( bizaria ) in great artists; another told of noted
men who had lived long by the daily use of alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Medical quacks were still numerous, but medical practice was now more
carefully regulated by law. Penalties were prescribed for persons who
prac- tised medicine without a medical degree; and this presumed a
four-year medical course (1500). No physician was allowed to prognose a
grave disease except by consultation with a colleague. Venetian
legislation re- quired physicians and surgeons to meet once a month to
exchange clinical notes, and to keep their knowledge up to date by
attending a course on anatomy at least once a year. The graduating
medical student had to swear that he would never protract the sickness
of a patient, that he would super- vise the preparation of his
prescriptions, and that he would take no part of the price charged by
the apothecary for filling them. The same law (Ven- ice, 1368) li mited
the apothecary’s charge for filling a prescription to ten</p>
<p>Surgery was rising rapidly in repute as its repertoire of operations
and instruments approached the variety and competence of ancient
Egyptian practice. Bernardo da Rapallo devised the perineal operation
for stone</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 533</p>
<p>(145 1), and Mariano Santo became famous for his many successful
lithot- omies by lateral incision ( c . 1530). Giovanni da Vigo, surgeon
to Julius II, developed better methods of ligature for arteries and
veins. Plastic surgery, known to the ancients, reappeared in Sicily
about 1450: mutilated noses, lips, and ears were repaired by grafts of
skin from other parts of the body, and so well that the lines of
adhesion could scarcely be detected. 24</p>
<p>Public sanitation was improving. As Doge of Venice ( 1 343-54),
Andrea Dandolo established the first known municipal commission of
public health; 25 other Italian cities followed the example. These
magistral della smith, tested all foods and drugs offered for public
sale, and isolated the victims of some contagious diseases. As a result
of the Black Death, Venice in 1 374 excluded from her port all ships
carrying persons or goods suspected of infection. At Ragusa (1377) such
arrivals were detained for thirty days in special quarters before being
admitted into the city. Marseille (1383) lengthened the detention period
to forty days — la quarantine, and Venice followed suit in 140 3. 26</p>
<p>Hospitals were multiplying under the zeal of both laity and clergy.
Siena built in 1305 a hospital famous for its size and services, and
Francesco Sforza founded the Ospedale Maggiore in Milan (1456). In 1423
Venice converted the island of Santa Maria di Nazaret into a lazaretto
to hos- pitalize infected persons; this is the first institution of its
kind known in Europe. 27 Florence in the fifteenth century had
thirty-five hospitals. 28 These establishments were generously supported
by public and private do- nations. Some hospitals were notable examples
of architecture, like the Ospedale Maggiore; some adorned their halls
with inspiring works of art. The Ospedale del Ceppo at Pistoia engaged
Giovanni della Robbia to mold for its walls terra-cotta reliefs vividly
describing typical hospital scenes; and the fagade of the Ospedale degli
Innocenti at Florence, designed by Brunellesco, was signalized by the
charming terra-cotta medallions placed in the spandrels of its portico
arches by Andrea della Robbia. Luther, who was so shocked by the
immorality that he found in Italy in 151 1, was also impressed by its
charitable and medical institutions. He described the hos- pitals in his
Table Talk:</p>
<p>In Italy the hospitals are handsomely built, and admirably pro-</p>
<p>vided with excellent food and drink, careful attendants, and learned
physicians. The beds and bedding are clean, and the walls are</p>
<p>covered with paintings. When a patient is brought in, his clothes</p>
<p>are removed in the presence of a notary who makes a faithful inven-
tory of them, and they are kept safely. A white smock is put on him,</p>

<p>Xand he is laid on a comfortable bed, with clean linen. Presently
two</p>
<p>doctors come to him, and servants bring him food and drink in clean
vessels. . . . Many ladies take turns to visit the hospitals and tend
the sick, keeping their faces veiled, so that no one knows who they
are;</p>
<p>each remains a few days and then returns home, another taking her
place. . . . Equally excellent are the foundling asylums of
Florence,</p>
<p>where the children are well fed and taught, suitably clothed in a</p>
<p>uniform, and altogether admirably cared for. 29</p>
<p>It is often the fatality of medicine that its heroic advances in
tnerapy are balanced — almost pursued — by new diseases. Smallpox and
measles, hardly known in Europe before the sixteenth century, now came
to the fore; Europe experienced its first recorded influenza epidemic in
1510; and epi- demics of typhus — a disease not mentioned before 1477 —
swept Italy in 1 505 and 1528. But it was the sudden appearance and
rapid dissemination of syphilis in Italy and France toward the end of
the fifteenth century that constituted the most startling phenomenon and
test of Renaissance medi- cine. Whether syphilis existed in Europe
before 1493, or was brought from America by the return of Columbus in
that year, is a matter still debated by the well informed, and not to be
settled here.</p>
<p>Certain facts support the theory of an indigenous European origin. On
July 25, 1463, a prostitute testified in a court at Dijon that she had
dissuaded an unwelcome suitor by telling him that she had le gros mal —
not further described in the record. 30 On March 25, 1494, the town
crier of Paris was directed to order from the city all persons afflicted
with la grosse verole . 31 We do not know what this “great pox” was; it
may have been syphilis. Late in 1494 a French army invaded Italy; on
February 21, 1495, it oc- cupied Naples; soon afterward a malady became
rampant there, which the Italians called il morbo gallico, “the French
disease,” alleging that the French had brought it into Italy. Many of
the French soldiers were in- fected with it; when they returned to
France, in October, 1495, they scat- tered the disease among the people;
in France, therefore, it was called le mal de Naples, on the assumption
that the French army had contracted it there. On August 7, 1495, two
months before the return of the French army from Italy, the Emperor
Maximilian issued an edict in which mention was made of malum francicum;
obviously this “French disease” could not be ascribed to the French army
not yet returned from Italy. From 1 500 on, the term morbus gallicus was
used throughout Europe to mean syphilis. 32 We may conclude that there
are suggestions, but no convincing evidence, that syphilis existed in
Europe before 1493.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 535</p>
<p>The case for an American origin is based upon a report written
between 1504 and 1506 (but not published till 1539) by a Spanish
physician, Ruy Diaz de l’lsla. He relates that on the return voyage of
Columbus the pilot of the admiral’s vessel was at tacked by a severe
fever, accompanied with frightful skin eruptions, and adds that he
himself, at Barcelona, had treated sailors infected with this new
disease, which, he says, had never been known there before. He
identified it with what Europe was - calling morbus galli- cus, and
contended that the infection had been brought from America. 33 Columbus,
on his first return from the West Indies, reached Palos, Spain, on March
15, 1493. In that same month Pintor, physician to Alexander VI, noted
the first appearance of the morbus gallicus in Rome. 84 Almost two years
elapsed between the return of Columbus and the French occupation of
Naples — sufficient time for the disease to spread from Spain to Italy;
on the other hand, it is not certain that the plague that ravaged Naples
in 1495 was syphilis. 35 Very few bones whose lesions may be interpreted
as syph- ilitic have been found in pre-Columbian European remains; many
such bones have been found among the relics of pre-Columbian America.*
38</p>
<p>In any case the new disease spread with terrifying speed. Caesar
Borgia apparently contracted it in France. Many cardinals, and Julius II
himself, were infected; but we must allow the possibility, in such
instances, of in- fection by innocent contact with persons or objects
bearing the active germ. Skin pustules had long since been treated in
Europe with mercurial oint- ment; now mercury became as popular as
penicillin is in our day; surgeons and quacks were called alchemists
because they turned mercury into gold. Prophylactic measures were taken.
A law of 1496 in Rome forbade barbers to admit syphilitics, or to use
instruments that had been employed by or on them. More frequent
examination of prostitutes was established, and some cities tried to
evade the problem by expelling courtesans; so Ferrara and Bologna
banished such women in 1496, on the ground that they had “a secret kind
of pox which others call the leprosy of St. Job.” 38 The Church preached
chastity as the one prophylaxis needed, and many churchmen practised
it.</p>
<p>The name syphilis was first applied to the disease by Girolamo
Fracas- toro, one of the most varied and yet best integrated characters
of the Renaissance. He had a good start: he was born at Verona (1483) of

<p>Xpatrician family that had already produced outstanding physicians.
At Padua he studied almost everything. He had Copernicus as a fellow
stu- dent, and Pomponazzi and Achillini to teach him philosophy and
anatomy; at twenty-four he was himself professor of logic. Soon he
retired to devote himself to scientific, above all medical, research,
tempered with a fond study of classic literature. This association of
science and letters produced a rounded personality, and a remarkable
poem, written in Latin on the model of Virgil’s Georgies, and entitled
Syphilis, sive de morho gallic o (1521). Italians since Lucretius have
excelled in writing poetical didactic poetry, but who would have
supposed that the undulant spirochete would lend itself to fluent verse?
Syphilus, in ancient mythology, was a shepherd who decided to worship
not the gods, whom he could not see, but the king, the only visible lord
of his flock; whereupon angry Apollo infected the air with noxious
vapors, from which Syphilus contracted a disease fouled with ulcerous
eruptions over his body; this is essentially the story of Job. Fracas-
toro proposed to trace the first appearance, epidemic spread, causes,
and therapy of “a fierce and rare sickness, never before seen for
centuries past, which ravished all of Europe and the flourishing cities
of Asia and Libya, and invaded Italy in that unfortunate war whence from
the Gauls it has its name.” He doubted that the ailment had come from
America, for it ap- peared almost simultaneously in many European
countries far apart. The infection</p>
<p>did not manifest itself at once, but remained latent for a certain
time, sometimes for a month . . . even for four months. In the majority
of</p>
<p>cases small ulcers began to appear on the sexual organs. . . .
Next,</p>
<p>the skin broke out with encrusted pustules. . . . Then these
ulcerated pustules ate away the skin, and . . . infected even the bones.
… In</p>
<p>some cases the lips or nose or eyes were eaten away, or, in others,
the whole of the sexual organs. 39</p>
<p>The poem goes on to discuss treatment by mercury or by guaiac — a
“holy wood” used by the American Indians. In a later work, De
contagione, Fracastoro dealt in prose with various contagious diseases —
syphilis, typhus, tuberculosis — and the modes of contagion by which
they could be spread. In 1 545 he was called by Paul III to be head
physician for the Council of Trent. Verona raised a noble monument to
his memory, and Giovanni dal Cavino graved his likeness on a medallion
which is one of the finest works of its kind.</p>

<p>the indiscr iminate name of “the plague.” It was one measure of the
progress of medicine that it now clearly distinguished and diagnosed the
specific character of an epidemic, and was prepared to deal with so
sudden and virulent an eruption as syphilis. Mere reliance on
Hippocrates and Galen could never have sufficed in such a crisis; it was
because the medical pro- fession had learned the necessity of ever fresh
and detailed study of symp- toms, causes, and cures, in an ever widening
and intercommunicated ex- perience, that it could meet this unexpected
test.</p>
<p>And it was because of such high qualifications, devotion, and
practical success, that the better class of physicians was now
recognized as belonging to the untitled aristocracy of Italy. Having
completely secularized their profession, they made it more respected
than the clergy. Several of them were not only the medical but as well
the political advisers, and the fre- quent and favored companions, of
princes, prelates, and kings. Many of them were humanists, familiar with
classical literature, collecting manu- scripts and works of art; often
they were the close friends of great artists. Finally, many of them
realized the Hippocratic ideal of adding philosophy to medicine; they
passed with ease from one subject to another in their studies and their
teaching; and they gave the professional philosophical fra- ternity a
stimulus to subject Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas — as they sub- jected
Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna — to a fresh and fearless examina- tion
of reality.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>At first glance the Italian Renaissance does not seem to offer a
reasonable harvest of philosophy. Its product cannot compare with the
heyday of French Scholasticism from Abelard to Aquinas, not to speak of
“th e school of Athens.” Its most famous name in philosophy (if we
extend the time limit of the Renaissance) is Giordano Bruno (1548?-!
600), whose work lies beyond the period of our study in this volume.
Pomponazzi remains; but who now does reverence to his poor heroic
skeptical squeak?</p>
<p>The humanists incubated a philosophical revolution by discovering,
and cautiously revealing, the world of Greek philosophy; but, for the
most part, and excepting Valla, they were too clever to lay their
beliefs on the table. The university professors of philosophy were
hobbled by the</p>
<p>Scholastic tradition: after spending seven or eight years struggling
through that wilderness, they either abandoned it for other fields of
study, or drove another generation into it, glorifying the hurdles that
had broken their wills</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>538</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xand brought their intellects to a safe dead end. And who knows but
many of them felt a certain mental and economic security in confining
them- selves to recondite problems carefully and fruitlessly phrased in
unintelligi- ble terminology? In most philosophical faculties
Scholasticism was still de rigueur, and already stiffening with the
approach of death. The old</p>
<p>medieval questions were laboriously reviewed in the old medieval
forms of disputation, and in the proud publications of the staff.</p>
<p>Two elements of life entered to revive philosophy: the conflict
between Platonists and Aristotelians, and the division of Aristotelians
into orthodox and Averroists. At Bologna and Padua these conflicts
became veritable duels, literally matters of life and death. The
humanists were mostly Pla- tonists; under the influence of Gemistus
Pletho, Bessarion, Theodoras Gaza, and other Greeks, they drank deeply
of the wine of the Dialogues, and could hardly understand how anyone
could bear the arid logic, im- potent Organon, and leaden golden mean of
the cautious Aristotle. But these Platonists were resolved to remain
Christians; and it was, so to speak, as their representative and
delegate that Marsilio Ficino devoted half his life to reconciling the
two systems of thought. For this purpose he studied widely, going so far
afield as to Zoroaster and Confucius. When he</p>
<p>reached Plotinus, and himself translated the Enneads, he felt that he
had found in mystic Neoplatonism the silken cord that would bind Plato
to Christ. He tried to formulate this synthesis in his Theologia
platonica, a confused medley of orthodoxy, occultism, and Hellenism, and
arrived hesitantly at a pantheistic conclusion: God is the soul of the
world. This became the philosophy of Lorenzo and his circle, of the
Platonic Acade- mies in Rome, Naples, and elswhere; from Naples it
reached Giordano Bruno; from Bruno it passed to Spinoza and thence to
Hegel; it is still alive.</p>
<p>But there was something to be said for Aristotle, especially if he
could be misinterpreted. Was Aquinas right in understanding him to teach
per- sonal immortality, or was Averroes right in reading De anima as
affirming the deathlessness of only the collective soul of mankind? The
terrible Averroes, that ogre of an Arab, whom Italian art had long since
pictured as prostrate under the feet of St. Thomas, was so active a
competitor for the domination of the Aristotelians that both Bologna and
Padua were hot with his heresy. It was at Padua that the Marsilius who
took its name had lost his reverence for the Church;* at Padua that
Filippo Algeri da Nola, the precursor of Nola-born Bruno, had imbibed
those frightful errors for</p>

<p>which he was sorrowfully cast into a barrel of boiling pitch. 40
Nicoletto Vemias, as professor of philosophy at Padua (1471-99), appears
to have taught there the doctrine that only the world-soul, not the
individual soul, is immortal; 41 and his pupil Agostino Nifo propounded
the same notion in a treatise De intellectu et daemonibus (1492).
Usually the skeptics sought to sooth the Inquisition by distinguishing
(as Averroes had done) between two kinds of truth — religious and
philosophical: a proposition, they urged, might be rejected in
philosophy from the standpoint of reason, while still accepted on faith
in the word of Scripture or the Church. Nifo professed the principle
with reckless simplification: Loquendum est ut plures, senti- endum ut
pauci — ’We must speak as the many do, we must think as the few.” 42
Nifo change d his mind or his speech as his hair changed, and reconciled
himself to orthodoxy. As professor of philosophy at Bologna he drew
lords, ladies, and multitudes to lectures dramatized with grimaces and
antics and salted with anecdotes and wit. He became socially the most
successful opponent of Pomponazzi.</p>
<p>Pietro Pomponazzi, the microscopic bombshell of Renaissance philoso-
phy, was so diminutive that his familiars called him Peretto — “little
Peter.” But he had a large head, a vast brow, a hooked nose, small,
black, pene- trating eyes: here was a man doomed to take life and
thought with painful seriousness. Born at Mantua (1462) of patrician
stock, he studied philoso- phy and medicine at Padua, took both degrees
at twenty-five, and was soon himself a professor there. All the
skeptical tradition of Padua descended to him and culminated in him; as
his admirer Vanini was to put it, “Pythag - oras would have judged that
the soul of Averroes had transmigrated into the body of Pomponazzi.” 43
Wisdom seem s always a reincarnation or echo, since it remains the same
through a thousand varieties and generations of error.</p>
<p>Pomponazzi continued to teach at Padua from 1495 to 1509; then the
winds of war swept through the city, and closed its historic University
halls. In 1512 we find him established at the University of Bologna.
There he remained to the end of his days, marrying thrice, always
lecturing on Aristotle, and modestly likening his relation to his master
to that of an in- sect exploring an elephant. 44 He thought it safer to
offer his ideas not as his own but as implied or explicit in Aristotle
interpreted by Alexander of Aphrodisias. His procedure seems at times
too humble, apparently sub- servient to a dead authority; but since the
Church, following Aquinas, claimed her doctrine to be that of Aristotle,
Pomponazzi may have felt that any demonstration of a heresy as truly
Aristotelian would be one way,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xshort of the stake, of teasing the orthodox tail. The Fifth Council
of the Lateran, under the presidency of Leo X (1513), condemned all who
should assert that the soul is one and indivisible in all men, and that
the individual soul is mortal. Three years later Pomponazzi published
his major work, De irmnortalitate animae, in which he sought to show
that the condemned view was precisely that of Aristotle. Mind, said
Pietro’s Aristotle, is at every step dependent upon matter; the most
abstract knowledge is ulti- mately derived from sensation; only through
the body can mind act upon the world; consequently a disembodied soul,
surviving the mortal frame, would be a functionless and helpless wraith.
As Christians and faithful sons of the Church, Pomponazzi concluded, we
are warranted in believing in the immortality of the individual soul; as
philosophers we are not. It seems never to have occurred to Pomponazzi
that his argument had no validity against Catholicism, which taught the
resurrection of the body as well as of the soul. Perhaps he did not take
this doctrine seriously, and had no thought that his readers would. No
one, so far as we know, urged it against him.</p>
<p>The book ran into a storm. The Fransciscan friars persuaded the doge
of Venice to order all procurable copies to be publicly burned, which
was done. Protests were made to the papal court, but Bembo and Bibbiena
were then high in Leo’s councils, and advised him that the conclusions
of the book were perfectly orthodox; the conclusions were. Leo was not
fooled; he knew quite well this little trick of the two truths; but he
con- tented himself with ordering Pomponazzi to write a decent word of
sub- mission. 45 Pietro complied in Apologiae libri tres (1518),
reasserting that as a Christian he accepted all the teaching of the
Church. About the same time Leo commissioned Agostino Nifo to compose an
answer to Pom- ponazzi’s book; as Agostino loved controversy, he
executed this assignment with pleasure and skill. It is remarkable, and
perhaps illustrates a continu- ing antipathy between the universities
and the clergy, that while Pom- ponazzi’s head hung, so to speak, in
this Inquisitorial balance, three uni - versities competed for his
services. Hearing that Pisa was seeking to lure him to her halls, the
magistrates of Bologna, formally subject to the pope but deaf to the
Franciscan furor, confirmed Pomponazzi’s professorial tenure for eight
years further, and raised his annual salary to 1600 ducats (0, 000?).
48</p>
<p>In two minor books, which he did not publish in his lifetime,
Pom-</p>
<p>ponazzi continued his skeptical campaign. In De incantatione he
reduced to natural causes many supposedly supernatural phenomena. A
physician</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 541</p>
<p>had written to him about cures allegedly due to incantations or
charms; Pietro bade him doubt. “It would be ridiculous and absurd,” he
wrote, - visible cause the reality of which is not guaranteed to us by
any solid probability .” 41 A s a Christian he accepts angels and
spirits; as a philosopher he rejects them; all causes under God are
natural. Reflecting his medical training, he laughs at the widespread
belief in occult sources of cure: if spirits could cure the ills of the
flesh they would have to be material, or use material means, to affect a
material body; and he ironically pictures the healing spirits as rushing
about with their paraphernalia of plasters, ointments, and pills . 48
However he admits certain curative powers in some plants and stones. He
will accept the miracles of the Bible, but suspects that they were
natural operations. The universe is governed by uniform and invariable
laws. Miracles are unusual manifestations of natural forces whose powers
and methods are only partly known to us; and what the people cannot
understand they ascribe to spirits or to God . 49 Without contradicting
this view of natural causation, Pomponazzi accepts much of astrology.
Not only are the lives of men subject to the action of the</p>
<p>heavenly bodies, but all human institutions, he thinks, even
including re- ligions, rise and flourish and decay according to
celestial influences. This is true also of Christianity; at the present
moment, says Pomponazzi, there are signs that Christianity is dying . 50
He adds that as a Christian he rejects all this as nonsense.</p>
<p>His final book, De fato, seems more orthodox, for it is a defense of
free will. He admits its incompatibility with divine foreknowledge and
omnis- cience, but stands on his consciousness of free activity, and on
the necessity of assuming some freedom of choice if there is to be any
moral responsi- bility in man. In his treatise on immortality he had
faced the question whether a moral code could succeed without
supernatural punishments and rewards. He held, with stoic pride, that
the sufficient reward of virtue is virtue itself, not any post-mortem
paradise ; 51 but he confessed that most men can be induced to decency
only by supernatural hopes and fears. Hence, he explained, great
legislators have taught the belief in a future state as an economical
substitute for ubiquitous police; and, like Plato, he justifies the
inculcation of fables and myths if these can help to control the natural
wickedness of men . 52</p>
<p>Therefore they have posited, for the virtuous, eternal reward in
an-</p>
<p>other life, but, for the sinful, eternal punishments, which
frighten</p>
<p>them very greatly. And the greater part of men, if they do good,
do</p>
<p>54 2</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xit more from fear of eternal punishment than hope of eternal good,
since the punishments are more known to us than those eternal</p>
<p>goods. And since this last device can benefit all men, of
whatever</p>
<p>class they are, the legislator, seeing the proneness of men to evil,
and intending the common good, has decreed that the soul is immortal,
not caring for truth but only for righteousness, so that he may bring
men to virtue. 52 *</p>
<p>Most men, he thinks, are so simple mentally and so brutish morally
that they must be treated as children or invalids. It is not wise to
teach them the doctrines of philosophy. “These things,” he says of his
own specula - tions, “are not to be communicated to common people, for
they are incapa - ble of receiving these secrets. We must beware even of
holding discourse concerning them with ignorant priests.” 53 He divides
mankind into phi - losophers and religious persons, and innocently
believes that “philosophers alone are the gods of the earth, and differ
as much from all other men, of whatever rank and condition, as genuine
men differ from those painted on canvas.” 54</p>
<p>In humbler moments he realized the narrow limits of human reason, and
the honorable futility of metaphysics. He pictured himself in his later
years as worn and haggard with thought about it and about, and likened
the philosopher to Prometheus, who, because he wished to steal fire from
heaven — i.e., snatch at divine knowledge — was condemned to be bound to
a rock and to have his heart gnawed at by a vulture endlessl y. 55 “The
thinker who inquires into the divine mysteries is like Proteus. . . .
The Inquisition persecutes him as a heretic, the multitude mocks him as
a fool.” 56</p>
<p>The controversies in which he engaged wore him down and helped to
ruin his health. He suffered from one illness after another, until
finally he determined to die. He chose a hard form of suicide: he
starved himself to death. Resisting every argument and every threat, and
triumphing even over force, he refused either to eat or to speak. After
seven days of this regimen he felt that he had won his battle for the
right to die, and might now safely speak. “I depart gladly,” he said.
Some one asked him, “Where are you going?” “Where all mortals go,” he
answered. His friends made a final e ffort to persuade him to eat, but
he preferred to die (1525).” Cardi - nal Gonzaga, who had been his
pupil, had the remains transported to Man- tua and buried there, and,
with typical Renaissance tolerance, raised a statue to his memory.</p>
<p>Pomponazzi had put into philosophic form a skepticism that had for
two</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 543</p>
<p>centuries been attacking the foundations of Christian belief. The
failure of the Crusades; the influx of Moslem ideas through Crusades,
trade, and Arab philosophy, the removal of the papacy to Avignon and its
ridiculous division in the Schism; the revelation of a pagan Greco-Roman
world full of wise men and great art and yet without the Bible or the
Church; the spread of education, and its increasing escape from
ecclesiastical control; the immorality and worldliness of the clergy,
even of popes, suggesting their private disbelief in the publicly
professed creed; their use of the idea of purgatory to raise funds for
their purposes; the reaction of the rising mercantile and moneyed
classes against ecclesiastical domination; the trans- formation of the
Church from a religious organization into a secular politi- cal power:
all these factors, and many more, combined to make the Italian middle
and upper classes, in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century,
“the most skeptical of European peoples.” 58</p>
<p>It is clear from the poetry of Politian and Pulci, and the philosophy
of Ficino, that the circle of Lorenzo had no actual belief in another
life; and the sentiment of Ferrara appears in the fun that Ariosto makes
of the inferno that to Dante had seemed so frightfully real. Almost half
the literature of the Renaissance is anticlerical. Many of the
condottieri were open athe- ists; 58 the cortigiani or courtiers were
far less religious than the cortigiane or courtesans; and a polite
skepticism was the mark and requisite of a gentleman. 60 Petrarch
lamented the fact that in the minds of many scholars it was a sign of
ignorance to prefer the Christian religion to pagan philoso- phy. 61 In
Venice, 1530, it was found that most of the upper ranks neg- lected
their Easter duty — i.e., did not go to confession and communion even
once a year. 02 Luther claimed to have found a saying current among the
e ducated classes in Italy on going to Mass: “Come, let us conform to
the popular error.” 68</p>
<p>As to the universities, a curious incident reveals the temper of
professors and students. Shortly after Pomponazzi’s death his pupil
Simone Porzio, invited to l ecture at Pisa, chose as his text
Aristotle’s Meteorology . The audience did not like the subject. Several
cried out impatiently: Quid de «»»»«? — “What about the soul?” Porzio
had to set the Meteorology aside and take up Aristotle’s De anima ; at
once t he audience was all attention. 64 We do not know whether in that
lecture Porzio expressed his belief that the human soul differs in no
essential point from the soul of a lion or a plant; we do know that he
so taught in his book De mente humana — On the H uman Mind;™ and he
seems to have escaped unharmed. Eugenio Tar - ralba, indicted by the
Spanish Inquisition in 1528, related that as a youth</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xhe had studied in Rome under three teachers, all of whom taught that
the soul was mortal. 66 Erasmus was astonished to find that at Rome the
funda- mentals of the Christian faith were topics of skeptical
discussion among the cardinals. One ecclesiastic undertook to explain to
him the absurdity of belief in a future life; others smiled at Christ
and the Apostles; many, he assures us, claimed to have heard papal
functionaries blaspheming the Mass. 67 The lower classes kept their
faith, as we shall see; the thousands who heard Savonarola must have
believed; and the example of Vittoria Colonna shows that piety could
survive education. But the soul of the great creed had been pierced with
the arrows of doubt; and the splendor of the medieval myth had been
tarnished by its accumulated gold.</p>
<p>V. GUICCIARDINI</p>
<p>The mind of Guicciardini summarizes the skeptical disillusionment of
the times. It was one of the sharpest minds of the age; too cynical for
our taste, too pessimistic for our hopes, but penetrating as a roving
searchlight in the skies, and candid with the frankness of a writer who
has wisely re- solved on solely posthumous publication.</p>
<p>Francesco Guicciardini had the initial advantage of aristocratic
birth. From his childhood he heard educated conversation in good
Italian, and learned to accept life with the realism and grace of a man
confident of his footing. His great-uncle was several times gonfalonier
of the republic; his grandfather held in turn most of the principal
offices in the government; his father knew Latin and Greek, and filled
several diplomati c posts; “my godfather,” wrote Francesco, “was Messer
Marsilio Ficino, the greatest Platonic philosopher then in the world” 68
— which did not prevent the his- torian from becoming an Aristotelian.
He studied civil law, and at the age of twenty-three was appointed
professor of law at Florence. He traveled widely, even to noting “the
fantastic and bizarre inventions” of Hierony - mus Bosch in Flanders. 69
At twenty- six he married Maria Salviati “because the baiviati, in
addition to their wealth, surpassed other families in influence and
power, and I had a great liking for these things.” 70</p>
<p>Nevertheless he had a passion for excellence, and the self-discipline
to create works of literary art. His Storia Fiorentina, written at
twenty- seven, is one of the most surprising products of an age when
genius, swol- len with its recovered heritage but loosened from
tradition, flowed full and free in a dozen streams. The book limited
itself to a short segment of Florentine history, from 1378 to 1509; but
it treated that period with an</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 545</p>
<p>accuracy of detail, a critical examination of sources, a penetrating
analysis of causes, a maturity and impartiality of judgment, a command
of vivid narrative in fine Italian, that were not matched by the Storie
Florentine that Machiavelli wrote eleven years later in the sixth decade
of his life.</p>
<p>In 1512, still a youth of thirty, Guicciardini was sent as ambassador
to Ferdinand the Catholic. In quick succession Leo X and Clement VII
made him governor of Reggio Emilia, Modena, and Parma, then governor
gen- eral of all the Romagna, then lieutenant general of all papal
troops. In 1534 he returned to Florence, and supported Alessandro de’
Medici throughout that scoundrel’s quinque nnium of tyranny. In 1537 he
was the chief agent in promoting the accession of Cosimo the Younger to
be Duke of Florence. When his hopes of dominating Cosimo faded,
Guicciardini retired to a rural villa to write in one year the ten
volumes of his masterpiece, the Storia d’ltalia.</p>
<p>It is inferior to his earlier work in freshness and vigor of style;
Guic-</p>
<p>ciardini had meanwhile studied the humanists, and slipped into
formality and rhetoric; even so it is a stately style, presaging
Gibbon’s monumental prose. The subtitle, History of the Wars, limits the
subject to matters military and political; at the same time the field is
widened to all Italy, and to all Europe as related to Italy; this is the
first history to view the Euro- pean political system as a connected
whole. Guicciardini writes of what for the most part he knew at first
hand, and, toward the end, of events in which he had played a part. He
collected documents sedulously, and is far more accurate and reliable
than Machiavelli. If, like his more famous con- temporary, he returns to
the ancient custom of inventing speeches for the persons of his tale, he
frankly states that they are true only in substance; some he specifies
as authentic; and all are used effectively to state both sides of a
debate, or to reveal the policies and diplomacy of the European states.
Taken together, this massive history, and the brilliant Storia Fioren-
tina, constitute Guicciardini as the greatest historian of the sixteenth
cen- tury. As Napoleon was anxious to see Goethe, so Charles V, at
Bologna, kept lords and generals waiting in an anteroom while he
conversed at length with Guicciardini. “I can create a hundred nobles in
an hour,” he said, “but I cannot produce such an historian in twenty
years.” 71</p>
<p>As a man of the world he did not take too seriously the efforts of
phi- losophers to diagnose the universe. He must have smiled at the
excitement aroused by Pomponazzi, if he noticed it. Since the
supernatural is beyond our ken, he considered it useless to war over
rival philosophies. Doubtless all religions are based upon assumptions
and myths, but these are forgivable</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>546</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xif they help to maintain social order and moral discipline. For man,
in Guic- ciardini’ s view, is by nature self-seeking, immoral, lawless;
he has to be checked at every turn by custom, morals, law, or force; and
religion is usu- ally the least disagreeable means to these ends. But
when a religion be- comes so corrupt that it has a demoralizing rather
than a moralizing influ- ence, a society is in a bad way, for the
religious supports of its moral code have been sapped. Guicciardini
writes, in his secret record:</p>
<p>To no man is it more displeasing than to me to see the ambition,</p>
<p>covetousness, and excesses of priests, not only because all
wickedness is hateful in itself, but because . . . such wickedness
should find no</p>
<p>place in men whose state of life implies a special relationship
to</p>
<p>God. . . . My relations with several popes have made me desire their
greatness at the expense of my own interest. Had it not been for this
consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as myself; not that</p>
<p>I might set myself free from the laws imposed upon us by Chris-</p>
<p>tianity . . . but that I might see this swarm of scoundrels (quest
a</p>
<p>caterva di scelerati) confined within due limits, so that they might
be forced to choose between a life without crime or a life without</p>
<p>power . 72</p>
<p>Nevertheless his own morality was hardly superior to that of the
priests. His personal code was to adjust himself to whatever powers were
at the moment supreme; his general principles he kept for his books.
There, too, he could be as cynical as Machiavelli:</p>
<p>Sincerity pleases and wins praise, dissimulation is censured and</p>
<p>hated; the former, however, is more useful to others than to oneself.
Therefore I should praise him whose usual mode of life was open</p>
<p>and sincere, and who only used dissimulation in certain things of</p>
<p>great importance; it then succeeds all the better, the more one
has</p>
<p>contrived to establish a reputation for sincerity . 78</p>
<p>He saw through the shibboleths of the various political parties in
Flor- ence; each group, though it shouted for liberty, wanted power.</p>
<p>It seems clear to me that the desire of dominating one’s fellows and
asserting superiority is natural to man, so that there are few so in
love with liberty that they would not seize a favorable opportunity
of</p>
<p>ruling and lording it. Look closely at the behavior of the
indwellers</p>
<p>of the selfsame city; mark and examine their dissensions, and you</p>
<p>shall find that the object is preponderance rather than freedom.</p>
<p>THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>Those, then, who are the foremost citizens do not strive after
liberty, though that be in their mouths; but the increase of their own
sway</p>
<p>and pre-eminence is really in their hearts. Liberty is a cant term
with them, and disguises their lust of superiority in power and honor .
74</p>
<p>He despised the Soderini merchant republic, accustomed to defend its
lib- erties with gold instead of arms. And he had no faith in the people
or democracy:</p>
<p>To speak of the people is to speak of madmen, for the people is a</p>
<p>monster full of confusion and error, and its vain beliefs are as
far</p>
<p>from truth as is Spain from India. . . . Experience shows that
things</p>
<p>very rarely come to pass according to the expectations of the multi-
tude. . . . The reason is that the effects . . . commonly depend on the
will of a few, whose intentions and purposes are nearly always dif-</p>
<p>ferent from those of the many . 75</p>
<p>Guicciardini was one of thousands in Renaissance Italy who had no</p>
<p>faith whatever; who had lost the Christian idyl, had learned the
emptiness of politics, expected no utopia, dreamed no dreams; and who
sat back helpless while a world of war and barbarism swept over Italy;
somber old men, emancipated in mind and broken in hope, who had
discovered, too late, that when the myth dies only force is free.</p>

<p>/. The Diplomat</p>
<p>One man remains, hard to classify: diplomat, historian, dramatist,
phi- losopher; the most cynical thinker of his time, and yet a patriot
fired with a noble ideal; a man who failed in everything that he
undertook, but left upon history a deeper mark than almost any other
figure of the age.</p>
<p>Niccolo Michiavelli was the son of a Florentine lawyer — a man of
mod- erate means, who held a minor post in the government, and owned a
small rural villa at San Casciano ten miles out of the city. The boy
received the ordinary literary education; learned to read Latin readily,
but no Greek. He took a fancy to Roman history, became enamored of Livy,
and found for almost every political institution and event of his day an
illuminating analogue in the history of Rome. He began, but seems never
to have com- pleted, the study of law. He cared little for the art of
the Renaissance, and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xexpressed no interest in the discovery of America; perhaps he felt
that merely the theater of politics was now enlarged, while the plot and
char- acters would remain unchanged. His one absorbing interest was
politics, the technique of influence, the chess of power. In 1498, aged
twenty-nine, he was appointed secretary to the Dieci della Guerra — a
Council of Ten for War — and held that post for fourteen years.</p>
<p>It was at first a modest function — compiling minutes and records,
sum- marizing reports, writing letters; but he was in government, he
could watch the politics of Europe from an inside observation point, he
could try to forecast developments by applying his knowledge of history.
His eager, nervous, ambitious spirit felt that only time was needed
before he would be at the top, playing the heady game of state against
the duke of Milan, the Senate of Venice, the king of France, the king of
Naples, the pope, the emperor. Soon he was sent on a mission to Caterina
Sforza, Countess of Imola and Forli (1498). She proved too subtle for
him, and he came back empty-handed, chastened. Two years later he was
tried again, accompanied Francesco della Casa as associate envoy to
Louis XII of France; della Casa fell ill, and Machiavelli had to head
the mission; he learned French, followed the court from chateau to
chateau, and trans- mitted to the Signory such alert intelligence, such
keen analyses, that on his return to Florence his friends acclaimed him
as now a graduate diplo- mat.</p>
<p>The turning point in his intellectual development was his mission, as
aide to Bishop Soderini, to Caesar Borgia at Urbino (1502). Called back
to Florence for a personal report, he celebrated his rise in the world
by taking a wife. In October he was again despatched to Caesar. He
joined him at Imola, and arrived at Senigallia just in time to note
Borgia’s happiness at h av- ing successfully ensnared, and strangled or
caged, the men who had con- spired against him. These were events that
stirred all Italy; to Machiavelli, meeting the brilliant ogre in the
flesh, they were lessons in philosophy. The man of ideas found himself
face to face with the man of action, and did him homage; envy burned in
the young diplomat’s soul as he realized the distance he had still to
travel from analytical and theoretical thought to a magnificent crushing
deed. Here was a man, six years younger than himself, who in two years
had overthrown a dozen tyrants, given order to a dozen cities, and made
himself the very meteor of his time; how weak words seemed before this
youth who used them with such scornful scarcity! From that moment Cae
sar Borgia became the hero of Machiavelli’s philosophy, as</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 549</p>
<p>Bismarck would be of Nietzsche’s; here, in this embodied will to
power, was a morality beyond good and evil, a model for supermen.</p>
<p>Back in Florence (1503), Machiavelli perceived that some members of
the government suspected him of having been swept off his mental feet by
the dashing Borgia. But his industrious scheming to advance the inter-
ests of his city regained for him the esteem of the Gonfalonier Soderini
and the Council of Ten for War. In 1507 he saw the triumph of one of his
basic ideas. No self-respecting state, he had long argued, could entrust
its defense to mercenary troops; they could not be relied upon in a
crisis; and they or their leader could almost always be bought by an
enemy armed with sufficient gold. A national militia should be formed,
said Machiavelli, composed of citizens, preferably of vigorous peasants
used to hardship and the open air; it should be kept always in good
equipment and training; and it should serve as the last firm line of the
republic’s defense. After long hesitation the government accepted the
plan, and empowered Machiavelli to realize it in action. In 1 508 he led
his new milizia to the siege of Pis a, where it acquitted itself well;
Pisa surrendered, and Machiavelli returned to Florence at the height of
his arc.</p>
<p>On a second mission to France (1510) he passed through Switzerland;
his enthusiasm was aroused by the armed independence of the Swiss Con-
federation, and he made it his ideal for Italy. Returning from France,
he saw the problem of his country: how could its separate principalities
unite to protect Italy if a united nation like France should decide to
absorb the whole peninsula?</p>
<p>The supreme test of his militia came too soon. In 1512 Julius II,
furious against Florence for having refused to join in expelling the
French from Italy, ordered the armies of the Holy League to suppress the
republic and restore the Medici; and Machiavelli ’s militia, assigned to
defend the Floren - tine line at Prato, broke and fled before the
trained mercenaries of the League. Florence was taken, the Medici
triumphed; Machiavelli lost both his reputation and his governmental
post. He made every effort to appease the victors, and might have
succeeded; but two ardent youths, conspiring to re-establish the
republic, were detected; among their papers was found a list of persons
on whose support they had counted; it included Machia- velli. He was
arrested and tortured with four turns of the rack; but no evidence of
his complicity having been found, he was released. Fearing rearrest, he
removed with his wife and four children to the ancestral villa at San
Casciano. There he spent all but the last of his remaining fifteen</p>

<p>Xyears, fretting in hopeful poverty. But for this disaster we should
never have heard of him, for it was in those hungry years that he wrote
books that moved the world.</p>

</ol>
<p>It was a dreary isolation for one who had lived at the very core
of</p>
<p>Florentine politics. Occasionally he would ride into Florence to talk
with old friends and explore any chance of re-employment. Several times
he wrote to the Medici, but he received no reply. In a celebrated letter
to his friend Vettori, then Florentine ambassador in Rome, he described
his life, and told how he came to write The Prince :</p>
<p>Since my last misfortunes I have led a quiet country life. I rise</p>
<p>with the sun, and go into one of the woods for a few hours to inspect
yesterday’s work; I pass some time with the woodcutters, who have</p>
<p>always some troubles to tell me, either of their own or their
neigh-</p>
<p>bors’. On leaving the wood I go to a spring, and thence up to my</p>
<p>bird-snaring enclosure, with a book under my arm — Dante, Petrarch,
or one of the minor poets, such as Tibullus or Ovid. I read their</p>
<p>amorous transports and the history of their loves, recalling my
own</p>
<p>to my mind, and time passes pleasantly in these meditations. Then I
betake myself to the inn by the roadside, chat with passers-by, ask</p>
<p>news of the places whence they come, hear various things, and note
the varied tastes and diverse fancies of mankind. This carries me to</p>
<p>the dinner hour, when, in the company of my brood, I swallow</p>
<p>whatever fare this poor little place of mine, and my slender
patri-</p>
<p>mony, can afford me. In the afternoon I go back to the inn. There
I</p>
<p>generally find the host, a butcher, a miller, and a couple of
brick-</p>
<p>makers. I mix with these boors the whole day, playing at cricca
and</p>
<p>trie true, which games give rise to a thousand quarrels and much</p>
<p>exchange of bad language; and we generally wrangle over farthings,
and our shouts can be heard in San Casciano town. Steeped in this</p>
<p>degradation my wits grow moldy, and I vent my rage at the in-</p>
<p>dignity of fate. . . .</p>
<p>At nightfall I return home and seek my writing room; and divest-</p>

and mire, I assume courtly attire; and thus suitably clothed, I

<p>within the ancient courts of ancient men, by whom, being
cordially</p>

which</p>

quire the motives of their actions; and these men in their humanity</p>

<p>my whole being is absorbed in them. And since Dante says that</p>
<p>there could be no science without retaining that which is heard,
I</p>
<p>have recorded that which I have acquired from the conversation of</p>
<p>these worthies, and have composed a pamphlet De principatibus, in
which I plunge as deeply as I can into cogitations upon this
subject,</p>
<p>discussing the nature of princedom, of how many species it consists,
how these are to be acquired, how they are maintained, why they are
lost; and if you ever cared for any of my scribbles, this one ought</p>
<p>not to displease you. And it should be especially welcome to a
new</p>
<p>prince; for which reason I dedicate it to his Magnificence,
Giuliano.</p>
<p>. . . (December 10, 1 5 1 3 ) 78</p>
<p>Probably Machiavelli has here simplified the story. Apparently he be-
gan by writing his Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy, completing
his commentary on only the first three books. He dedicated these
Discorsi to Zanobi Buondelmonti and Cosimo Rucellai, saying: “I send you
the worthiest gift I have to offer, inasmuch as it comprises all that I
have learned from long experience and continuous study.” He remarks
that</p>
<p>As he proceeded with the Discourses, he perceived that they would be
too long, and too long delayed in their completion, to serve as a
practical gift to one of the ruling Medici. Therefore he interrupted the
work to write a summary that would embody his conclusions; this would
have a better chance of being read, and of bringing a fair return in
the</p>
<p>friendship of the powerful family that now (1513) ruled half of
Italy. So he composed 11 principe (as he came to entitle the book) in a
few months of that year. He planned to dedicate it to Giuliano de’
Medici, then ruling Florence; but Giuliano died (1516) before
Machiavelli could make up his mind to send the book to him; so he
rededicated it, and sent it, to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, who made no
acknowledgment of it. It circulated in manuscript, and was
surreptitiously copied; it was not printed till 1532,</p>
<p>552 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xfive years after the author’s death. Thereafter it was among the
most frequently reprinted books in any language.</p>
<p>To his own description of himself we can add only the anonymous por-
trait of him in the Uffizi Gallery. It shows a slender figure with pale
face, hollow cheeks, sharp dark eyes, thin lips tightly closed;
obviously a man of thought rather than of action, and of keen
intelligence rather than of amiable will. He could not be a good
diplomat because he was too visibly subtle, nor a good statesman because
he was too intense, grasping ideas fanatically as in the portrait he
tightly clasps the gloves that affirm his semi - genteel rank. This man
who so often wrote like a cynic, whose lips so often curled into
sarcasm, who plumed himself on such perfect mendacity that he could make
people think he lied when he spoke the truth, 77 was in his heart of
hearts a flaming patriot, who made the salus populi the supremo lex ,
and subordinated all morality to the unification and redemption of
Italy.</p>
<p>There were many unlikable qualities in him. When Borgia was up he
idealized him; when Borgia was down he followed the crowd and de-
nounced the broken Caesar as a criminal and “a rebel against Christ.” 78
When the Medici were out he condemned them eloquently; when they were in
he licked their boots for a post. He not only visited brothels be- fore
and after marriage, but sent his friends detailed descriptions of his
ad- ventures there. 79 Several of his letters are so coarse that not
even his most voluminous and admiring biographer has dared to publish
them. Nearing fifty, Machiavelli writes: “Cupid’s nets still enthrall
me. Bad roads cannot</p>
<p>Meanwhile he turned his able pen to divers forms of composition, and
rivaled the masters in each. In a treatise on the art of war ( Uarte
della guerra, 1520) he announced to states and generals, from his ivory
tower, the laws of military power and success. A nation that has lost
the martial virtues is doomed. An army requires not gold but men; “gold
alone will not procure good soldiers, but good soldiers will always
procure gold”; 81 gold will flow to the strong nation, but strength
departs from the rich na- tion, for wealth makes for ease and decay.
Consequently an army must</p>
<p>THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>be kept busy; a little war now and then will keep the martial muscles
and apparatus in trim. Cavalry is beautiful, except when faced with
sturdy pikes; the infantry must ever be regarded as the very nerve and
foundation of an army. 82 Mercenary armies are the shame and sloth and
ruin of Italy; each state should have a citizen militia, constituted of
men who would be fighting for their own country, their own lands.</p>
<p>Trying his hand at fiction, Machiavelli wrote one of Italy’s most
popular novelle, Belfagor arcidiavolo, bursting with satiric wit on the
institution of marriage. Turning to drama, he composed the outstanding
comedy of the Italian Renaissance stage, Mandragola. The prologue struck
a new note, making a novel curtsey to critics:</p>
<p>Should anyone seek to cow the author by evil-speaking, I warn</p>
<p>you that he, too, knows how to speak evil, and indeed excels in
the</p>
<p>art; and that he has no respect for anyone in Italy, though he
bows</p>
<p>and scrapes to those better dressed than himself. 83</p>
<p>The play is an astounding revelation of Renaissance morals. The scene
is laid in Florence. Callimaco, hearing an acquaintance praise the
beauty of Lucrezia, wife of Nicias, decides — though he has never seen
her — that he must seduce her if only to be able to sleep in peace. He
is disturbed to learn that Lucrezia is as famous for her modesty as for
her beauty; but he takes hope on being told that Nicias frets over her
failure to conceive. He bribes a friend to introduce him to Nicias as a
physician. He professes to have a potion that will make any woman
fertile; but, alas, the first man who lies with her after she has taken
it will soon afterward die. He offers to undertake this mortal
adventure, and Nicias, with the traditional kind- ness of characters to
their authors, consents to be replaced. But Lucrezia is obstinately
virtuous; she hesitates to commit both adultery and murder in one night.
All is not lost; her mother, lusting for progeny, bribes a friar to
advise her in the confessional to go through with the plan. Lucrezia
yields, drinks, lies with Callimaco, and becomes pregnant. The story
ends with everybody happy: the friar purifies Lucrezia, Nicias rejoices
in his vicarious parentage, and Callimaco can sleep. The play is
excellent in structure, brilliant in dialogue, powerful in satire. What
startles us is not the seductive theme, long hackneyed in classical
comedy, nor even the merely physical interpretation of love, but the
turn of the plot upon the readiness of a friar to counsel adultery for
twenty-five ducats, and the fact that in 1520 the play was produced with
great success before Leo X in</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>XRome. The Pope was so pleased with it that he asked Cardinal Giulio
de’ Medici to give Machiavelli some employment as a writer. Giulio
suggested a history of Florence, and offered 300 ducats (,750?).</p>
<p>The resultant Storie Florentine (1520-5) was almost as decisive a
revolu- tion in historiography as The Prince in political philosophy. It
is true that the book had vital defects: it was hastily inaccurate, it
plagiarized substan- tial passages from previous historians, it was more
interested in the strife of factions than in the development of
institutions, and it totally ignored cultural history — as did nearly
every historian before Voltaire. But it was the first major history
written in Italian, and its Italian was clear, vigorous, and direct; it
rejected the fables with which Florence had embellished her origins; it
abandoned the usual chronicle year-by-year plan, and gave, in- stead, a
smooth-flowing and logical narrative; it dealt not merely with events
but with causes and effects; and it forced upon the chaos of Floren-
tine politics a clarifying analysis of conflicting families, classes,
and inter- ests. It carried the tale along on two unifying themes: that
the popes had kept Italy divided to preserve the temporal independence
of the papacy; and that the great advances of Italy had come under
princes like Theo- doric, Cosimo, and Lorenzo. That a book with such
tendencies should have been written by a man seeking papal ducats, and
that Pope Clement VII accepted its dedication without complaint,
illustrates the courage of the author and the mental and financial
liberality of the Pope.</p>
<p>The History of Florence gave Machiavelli occupation for five
years,</p>
<p>but it did not satisfy his longing to swim again in the muddy stream
of politics. When Francis I lost everything but honor and his skin at
Pavia (1525), and Clement VII found himself helpless against Charles V,
Ma- chiavelli sent letters to the Pope and to Guicciardini, explaining
what could yet be done against the imminent Spanish-German conquest of
Italy; and perhaps his suggestion that the Pope should arm, empower, and
finance Giovanni delle Bande Nere might have delayed destiny awhile.
When Giovanni died, and the German horde advanced upon Florence as a
rich and plunderable ally of the French, Machiavelli rushed to the city,
and, at Clement’s request, prepared a report on how the walls might be
restore d to make it defensible. On May 18, 1526, he was chosen by the
Medicean government to head a board of five “Curators of the Walls.” The
Germans, however, by-passed Florence and headed for Rome. When that city
was sacked, and Clement was a prisoner of the mob, the republican party
in Florence once more expelled the Medici and restored the republic (May
16, 1527). Machiavelli rejoiced, and hopefully applied for his old post
as</p>
<p>THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>secretary of the Ten for War. He was turned down (June io, 1527); his
dealings with the Medici had lost him the support of the
republicans.</p>
<p>He did not long survive that blow. The vital spark of life and
hope</p>
<p>flickered out in him, and left the flesh spiritless. He fell ill,
suffering violent spasms of the stomach. Wife, children, and friends
gathered round his bedside. He confessed to a priest and died, twelve
days after his rejection. He left his family in the utmost poverty, and
the Italy that he had labored to unite was in ruins. He was buried in
the church of Santa Croce, where a handsome monument, marked with the
words, Tanto nomini nullum par elogium — “No eulogy would do justice to
so great a name”— bears witness that an Italy at last united has
forgiven his sins and remembered his dream.</p>
<p>3 . The Philosopher</p>
<p>Let us examine the “Machiavellian” philosophy as impartially as we
can. Nowhere else shall we find so much independent and fearless
thinking on ethics and politics. Machiavelli was justified in claiming
that he had opened new routes on relatively untraveled seas.</p>
<p>It is almost exclusively a political philosophy. There is no
metaphysics here, no theology, no tbeism or atheism, no discussion of
determinism or free will; and ethics itself is soon shoved aside as
subordinate to, almost a tool of, politics. Politics he understands as
the high art of creating, captur- ing, protecting, and strengthening a
state. He is interested in states rather than in humanity. He sees
individuals merely as members of a state; except as they help to
determine its destiny, he pays no attention to the parade of egos across
the landscape of time. He wishes to know why states rise and fall, and
how they can be made to defer as long as possible their inevitable</p>
<p>A philosophy of history, a science of government, are possible, he
thinks, because human nature never changes.</p>
<p>Wise men say, not without reason, that whoever wishes to foresee</p>
<p>the future must consult the past; for human events ever resemble</p>
<p>those of preceding times. This arises from the fact that they are</p>
<p>produced by men who have been, and ever will be, animated by the same
passions; and thus they must necessarily have the same results. 84 … I
believe that the world has always been the same, and has always
contained as much good and evil, although variously distributed</p>
<p>among the nations according to the times. 85</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>556</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>XAmong the most instructive regularities of history are the phenomena
of growth and decay in civilizations and states. Here Machiavelli meets
a very complex problem with a very simple formula. “Valor produces</p>
<p>peace; peace, repose; repose, disorder; disorder, ruin. From disorder
order springs; from order, valor {virtu ) ; and from this, glory and
good fortune. Hence wise men have observed that the age of literary
excellence is sub- sequent to that of distinction in arms; and that . .
. great warriors are produced before philosophers .” 86 In addition to
the general factors in growth or decay may be the action and influence
of leading individuals; so the excessive ambition of a ruler, blinding
him to the inadequacy of his resources for his aims, may ruin his state
by leading it into war with a stronger power. Fortune or chance also
enters into the rise and fall of states. “Fortune is the arbiter of one
half our actions, but she still leaves us to direct the other half .” 87
The more virtil a man has, the less will he be subject to fortune or
yield to it.</p>
<p>The history of a state follows general laws, determined by the
natural wickedness of men. All men are by nature acquisitive, deceitful,
pugna- cious, cruel, and corrupt.</p>
<p>Whoever wishes to found a state and give it laws, must start with</p>
<p>assuming that all men are bad and ever ready to display their vicious
nature whenever they find occasion for it. If their evil disposition</p>
<p>remains concealed for a time, it must be attributed to some unknown
reason; and we must assume that it lacked occasion to show itself;</p>
<p>but time . . . does not fail to bring it to light. . . . The wish to
acquire</p>
<p>is in truth very natural and common, and men always acquire when they
can; and for this they will be praised, not blamed . 88</p>
<p>This being so, men can be made good — i.e., capable of living with
order in a society — only by the application, in sequence, of force,
deceit, and habit. This is the origin of a state: the organization of
force through army and police, the establishment of rules and laws, and
the gradual formation of habits, for the maintenance of leadership and
order in a human group. The more developed a state, the less force will
have to be used or visible in it; indoctrination and habit will suffice;
for in the hands of a capable lawgiver or ruler the people are as soft
clay in the hands of a sculptor.</p>
<p>The best means of habituating naturally wicked men to law and order
is religion. Machiavelli, whom his admirer Paolo Giovio calls irrisor et
atheos, a satirical atheist , 88 writes enthusiastically about religious
institu- tions:</p>
<p>THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>Although the founder of Rome was Romulus . . . yet the gods did</p>
<p>not judge the laws of this prince sufficient . . . and therefore
they</p>
<p>inspired the Roman Senate to elect Numa Pompilius as his succes-</p>
<p>sor. . . . Numa, finding a very savage people, and wishing to
reduce</p>
<p>them to civil obedience by the arts of peace, had recourse to
religion as the most necessary and assured support of any civil society;
and he established it upon such foundations that for many centuries
there</p>
<p>was nowhere more fear of the gods than in that republic; which</p>
<p>greatly facilitated all the enterprises which the Senate or its
great</p>
<p>men attempted. . . . Numa feigned that he held converse with a</p>
<p>nymph, who dictated to him all that he wished to persuade the peo-
ple to. . . . In truth there never was any remarkable lawgiver . . . who
did not resort to divine authority, as otherwise his laws would not</p>
<p>have been accepted by the people; for there are many good laws the
importance of which is known to the sagacious lawgiver, but the</p>
<p>reasons for which are not sufficiently evident to enable him to
per-</p>
<p>suade others to submit to them; and therefore do wise men, to re-</p>
<p>move this difficulty, resort to divine authority. 90 . . . The
observ-</p>
<p>ance of religious institutions is the cause of the greatness of
republics; disregard of these institutions produces the ruin of states.
For where the fear of God is wanting, there the country will be
destroyed,</p>
<p>unless it be sustained by fear of the prince, which may for a
time</p>
<p>supply the want of religion. But the lives of princes are short. . .
.</p>
<p>Princes and republics who wish to maintain themselves . . . must</p>
<p>above all things preserve the purity of religious observances,
and</p>
<p>treat them with proper reverence. 92 . . . Of all men who have been
eulogized, those deserve it most who have been the authors and</p>
<p>founders of religions. Next come such as have established republics
or kingdoms. After these the most celebrated are those who have</p>
<p>commanded armies and have extended the possessions of their coun-
try. To these may be added literary men. . . . Conversely, those men are
doomed to infamy and universal execration who have destroyed religions,
who have overturned republics and kingdoms, who are</p>
<p>enemies of virtue or of letters . 93</p>
<p>Having accepted religion in general, Machiavelli turns upon
Christianity and excoriates it as having failed to make good citizens.
It diverted too much attention to heaven, and enfeebled men by preaching
the feminine virtues:</p>
<p>The Christian religion makes us hold of small account the love of</p>
<p>this world, and renders us more gentle. The ancients, on the con-</p>
<p>trary, found their highest delight in this world . . . Their
religion</p>
<p>558</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xbeatified none but men crowned with worldly glory, such as leaders
of armies and founders of republics; whereas our religion has rather
glorified meek and contemplative men than men of action. It has</p>
<p>placed the supreme good in humility and poorness of spirit, and
in</p>
<p>contempt for worldly things; whereas the other placed it in
great-</p>
<p>ness of mind, in bodily strength, and in all that gives men
daring.</p>
<p>. . . Thus the world has fallen a prey to the wicked, who have
found</p>
<p>men readier, for the sake of going to paradise, to submit to
blows</p>
<p>rather than to resent them. 94 . . .</p>
<p>Had the religion of Christianity been preserved according to the</p>
<p>ordinances of its Founder, the states and commonwealths of Chris-</p>
<p>tendom would have been far more united and happy than they are.</p>
<p>Nor can there be a greater proof of its decadence than the fact that
the nearer people are to the Roman Church, the head of this religion,
the less religious are they. And whoever examines the principles on</p>
<p>which that religion is founded, and sees how widely different
from</p>
<p>those principles its present practice and application are, will
judge</p>
<p>that her ruin or chastisement is near at hand. 05 . . . Possibly the
Chris- tian religion would have been entirely extinguished by its
corrup-</p>
<p>tion, had not St. Francis and St. Dominic . . . restored it to
its</p>
<p>original principles. … To ensure a long existence to religious
sects</p>
<p>or republics, it is necessary frequently to bring them back to
their</p>
<p>original principles . 06</p>
<p>We do not know whether these words were written before news had
reached Italy of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>The rebellion of Machiavelli against Christianity is quite different
from the rebellion of Voltaire, Diderot, Paine, Darwin, Spencer, Renan.
These men rejected the theology of Christianity, but retained and
admired the Christian moral code. This attitude continued till
Nietzsche, and softened the “conflict between religion and science.”
Machiavelli is not bothered by the incredibility of the dogmas; he takes
that for granted, but accepts the theology with a good stomach on the
ground that some system of supernatural belief is an indispensable
support of social order. What he rejects most decisively in Christianity
is its ethic, its conception of good- ness as gentleness, humility,
nonresistance; its love of peace and its de- nunciation of war; its
assumption that states, as well as citizens, are bound by the one moral
code. For his part he prefers the Roman ethic, based upon the principle
that the safety of the people or state is the supreme law. “Where it is
an absolute question of the welfare of our country, we</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 55 9</p>
<p>must admit of no considerations of justice or injustice, of mercy or
cruelty, of praise or ignominy; but putting all else aside we must adopt
whatever course will save the nation’s existence and liberty .” 97
Morality in general</p>
<p>If we apply these considerations to the ethics of war, Machiavelli is
sure that they make Christian pacifism ridiculous and treasonable. War
violates practically all the commandments of Moses: it swears, lies,
steals, kills, commits adultery by the thousands; nevertheless, if it
preserves the society, or strengthens it, it is good. When a state
ceases to expand it begins to decay; when it loses the will to war it is
finished. Peace too long main- tained is enervating and disruptive; an
occasional war is a national tonic, restoring discipline, vigor, and
unity. The Romans of the Republic kept themselves ever ready for war;
when they saw that they would have trou- ble with another state, they
did nothing to avoid the war, but sent an army to attack Philip V in
Macedon and Antiochus III in Greece rather than wait for them to bring
the evils of war to Italy . 102 Virtue, to a Roman, was not humility or
gentleness or peace, but virility, manliness, courage with energy and
intelligence. This is what Machiavelli means by virtu.</p>
<p>From this point of view of a statesmanship quite freed of moral
re-</p>
<p>straints, Machiavelli moves to meet what seems to him the basic
problem of his time: to achieve for Italy the unity and strength
indispensable to her collective liberty. He views with indignation the
division, disorder, cor- ruption, and weakness of his country; and here
we find what in Petrarch’s day was so rare — a man who loved his city
not the less because he loved his country more. Who was responsible for
keeping Italy so divided, and therefore so helpless against the
foreigner?</p>
<p>560</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XA nation can never be united and happy except when it obeys</p>
<p>only one government, whether a republic or a monarchy, as is the</p>
<p>case in France and Spain; and the one cause why Italy is not in
the</p>
<p>same condition is the Church. For having acquired, and holding, a</p>
<p>temporal dominion, yet she has never had sufficient power or cour-
age to enable her to seize the rest of the country and make herself</p>
<p>sole sovereign of all Italy .* 103</p>
<p>We have a new idea here: Machiavelli condemns the Church not for pro-
tecting her temporal power, but for not having used all her resources to
bring Italy under her political rule. So Machiavelli admired Caesar
Borgia at Imola and Senigallia, because he thought he saw in that
ruthless youth the conception and promise of a united Italy; and he was
prepared to justify any means that the Borgias might use to accomplish
this heroic con- summation. When he turned against Caesar at Rome in 1
503 it may have been through rage that his idol had allowed a cup of
poison (as Machiavelli thought) to destroy the dream.</p>
<p>From two centuries of disunity Italy had fallen into such physical
weak- ness and social decay that now (Machiavelli argued) only violent
means could save her. Governments and people alike were corrupt. Sexual
vice had come to replace military ardor and skill. As in the dying days
of an- cient Rome, the citizens had delegated to others — there to
barbarians, here to mercenaries — the defense of their cities and their
lands; but what did these mercenary bands, or their condottieri, care
for the unity of Italy? They lived and thrived by its division. They had
by mutual agreement made war a game almost as safe as politics; their
soldiers had inconvenient objections to being killed; and when they met
foreign armies they took to their heels and “brought Italy to slavery
and contempt.” 105</p>
<p>Who, then, would make Italy one? How could it be done? Not by</p>
<p>democratic suasion; men and cities were too individualistic, too
partisan, and too corrupt, to accept union peaceably; it would have to
be imposed upon them by all the methods of statecraft and war. Only a
ruthless dictator</p>
<ul>
<li>Guicciardini wrote an important comment on this passage: “It is true
that the Church</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 561</p>
<p>could do it; one who would not let conscience make a coward of him,
but would strike with an iron hand, letting his great aim justify all
means.</p>
<p>We are not sure that The Prince was written in this mood. In the very
year 1513 in which it was apparently begun, Machiavelli wrote to a
friend that “the idea of Italian union is laughable. Even if the heads
of the states could agree, we have no soldiers but the Spaniards that
are worth a far- thing. Moreover, the people would never agree with the
leaders.” 106 But in that same 1513 Leo X, young and rich and clever,
had reached the papacy; Florence and Rome, so long enemies, were united
under the Medici. When Machiavelli transferred the dedication of the
book to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, that state too had fallen to the
Medici. The new Duke was only twenty-four in 1516; he had shown ambition
and courage; Machiavelli might forgivably look to this reckless spirit
as one who, under the guidance and diplomacy of Leo (and the instruction
of Machiavelli) could accom- plish what Caesar Borgia, under Alexander
VI, had begun — could lead the Italian states, at least north of Naples
and omitting proud Venice, into a federation strong enough to discourage
foreign invasion. There is evidence that this was also Leo’s hope. The
dedica tion of The Prince to the Medici, though probably aiming first of
all to win employment for the author, could sincerely think of that
family as the possible creators of Italian unity.</p>
<p>The form of 11 principe was traditional: it followed the outline
and</p>
<p>method of a hundred medieval treatises De regimine principum. But in
content what a revolution! No idealistic charge here to a prince to be a
saint, no appeal to him to apply the Sermon on the Mount to the problems
of a throne. On the contrary:</p>
<p>It being my intention to write something that shall be useful to</p>
<p>him who comprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to fol- low
up the real truth of a matter than the imagination of it. Many</p>
<p>have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have
never</p>
<p>been known or seen, for how one lives is so far distant from how one
ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be
done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; a man who wishes to
act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with de-</p>
<p>struction amidst so much that is evil. Hence it is necessary for
a</p>
<p>prince who wishes to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and</p>
<p>to make use of it or not according to necessity. 107</p>
<p>The prince, therefore, must distinguish resolutely between morality
and statesmanship, between his private conscience and the public good,
and must be ready to do for the state what would be called wickedness in
the relations</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xof individuals. He must scorn half measures; enemies who cannot be
won over must be crushed; contenders for his throne must be killed. He
must have a strong army, for a statesman can speak no louder than his
guns. He must keep his army in constant health, discipline, and
equipment; and he must train himself for war by undertaking frequently
the hardships and dangers of the hunt. At the same time he must study
the arts of diplomacy, for sometimes cunning and deceit achieve more
than force, and less ex- pensively. Treaties are not to be honored when
they have become a detri- ment to the nation; “a wise lord cannot, nor
ought he, keep faith when such observance can be turned against him, and
when the reasons that caused him to pledge it no longer exist .” 108</p>
<p>Some degree of public support is indispensable. But if a ruler
must</p>
<p>choose between being feared without love or being loved without fear,
he must sacrifice the love . 109 On the other hand (say the Discorsi) “a
multi - tude is more easily governed by humanity and gentleness than by
haughti- ness and cruelty. . . . 110 Titus, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,
Antoninus, and Marcus Aurelius did not require the pretorian guard nor
the legions to de- fend them, because they were protected by their own
good conduct, the goo d will of the people, and the love of the Senate
.” 111 To secure popular support the prince should patronize art and
learning, provide public spec- tacles and games, and honor the guilds,
always, however, maintaining the majesty of his rank . 112 He should not
give the people liberty, but should comfort them as far as possible with
the appearances of liberty. Subject cities, like Pisa and Arezzo in the
case of Florence, must be dealt with vigorously, even cruelly, at the
outset; then, when obedience has been es- tablished, their submission
may be made habitual by gentler means. In- discriminate and prolonged
cruelty is suicidal . 113</p>
<p>The ruler should support religion, and should himself appear to be
re- ligious, whatever his private beliefs . 114 Indeed, it is more
important and profitable to the prince to seem to be virtuous than to be
so.</p>
<p>Though a prince need not possess all the virtues, to seem to have</p>
<p>them is useful; as, for example, to seem merciful, loyal, humane,
reli- gious, and sincere; it is also useful to be so, but with a mind so
flexible that if the need arise he can be the contrary. . . . He should
be care- ful to let nothing fall from his lips that is not instinct with
the five</p>
<p>qualities mentioned, and must appear to those who see and hear him
all compassion, all faith, all humanity, all religion, all integrity. .
. .</p>
<p>One must color his conduct, and be a great dissembler; and men are so
simple, so absorbed in present necessities, that they are easily</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 563</p>
<p>deceived. . . . Everyone sees what you appear to be, few know what
you are; and those few dare not oppose the opinion of the many . 115</p>
<p>To these precepts Machiavelli adds examples. He notes the success of
Alexander VI, and thinks it entirely due to marvelous lying. He admires
Ferdinand the Catholic of Spain for always putting a religious front on
his military enterprises. He praises the means — warlike courage and
strategic skill mingled with diplomatic craft — by which Francesco
Sforza rose to the throne of Milan. But above all he holds up as his
supreme and almost per- fect exemplar Caesar Borgia:</p>
<p>When all the actions of the Duke are recalled, I do not know how</p>
<p>to blame him; but rather it appears to me that I ought to offer
him</p>
<p>for imitation to all those who are . . . raised to government. . . .
He</p>
<p>was considered cruel; nevertheless his cruelty reconciled all the</p>
<p>Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. . . .
Having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, he could not have regulated
his</p>
<p>conduct otherwise; and only the shortening of the life of Alexander,
and his own sickness, frustrated his designs. Therefore he who con-
siders it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to
gain</p>
<p>friends, to overcome enemies by force or fraud, to make himself
at</p>
<p>once feared and loved by the people, to be followed and revered by
the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him,
to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and</p>
<p>gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and
create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such</p>
<p>a way that they must help him with zeal and offend him with cau-</p>
<p>tion, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this</p>
<p>man . 110</p>
<p>Machiavelli admired Borgia because he felt that his methods and
charac- ter, had it not been for the simultaneous illness of Pope and
son, would have gone far to unite Italy. Now, in concluding The Prince ,
he appeals to the young Duke Lorenzo, and through him to Leo and the
Medici, to organize the union of the peninsula. He describes his
countrymen as “more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the
Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without
order, beaten, de- spoiled, pillaged, and torn, and overrun by foreign
powers.” “Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall heal her
wounds. . . . She entreats God to send some one who shall deliver her
from these wrong and alien in- solen cies .” 117 The situation is
critical, but the opportunity is ripe. “Italy</p>

<p>Xwho better than the Medici, the most famous family in Italy, and now
heading the Church?</p>
<p>Who could express the love with which Italy would hail her</p>
<p>liberator, with what thirst for revenge, what stubborn faith,
what</p>
<p>devotion, what tears? What door would be closed to him? — who</p>
<p>would refuse him obedience? To all of us this barbarous dominion</p>
<p>is a stench in the nostrils. Let therefore your illustrious house
take</p>
<p>up this charge, with that courage and hope with which all just
en-</p>
<p>terprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native</p>
<p>country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified</p>
<p>those words of Petrarch:</p>

be, for the ancient valor is not yet dead in the veins of Italy.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Considerations</li>
</ol>
<p>So the cry that Dante and Petrarch had sent up to alien emperors was
here raised to the Medici; and indeed, had Leo lived longer and played
less, Machiavelli might have seen the liberation begin. But young
Lorenzo died in 1519, Leo in 1521; and in 1527, the year of
Machiavelli’s death, Italy’s subjection to a foreign power was complete.
Liberation would have to wait 343 years until Cavour would effect it by
Machiavellian statesmanship.</p>
<p>Philosophers have been well nigh unanimous in condemning The Prince,
and statesmen in practising its precepts. A thousand books began to ap-
pear against it on the morrow of its publication (1532). But Charles V
studie d it carefully, Catherine de’ Medici brought it to France, Henry
III and Henry IV of France had it with them at their death, Richelieu
ad- mired it, William of Orange kept it under his pillow as if to
memorize it by osmosis. 118 Frederick the Great of Prussia wrote an
Anti-Machiavel as a prelude to outprincing The Prince. To most rulers,
of course, these pre- cepts were no revelation, except as revealing
injudiciously the secrets of their guild. Dreamers who thought to turn
Machiavelli into a Jacobin fan- cied that he had written The Prince not
to express his own philosophy but, by sarcastic indirection, to expose
the ways and wiles of rulers; however,</p>
<p>THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>565</p>
<p>the Discourses expound at greater length the same views. Francis
Bacon ventured a condoning word: “Our thanks are due to Machiavelli and
simi - lar writers, who have openly and without dissimulation shown us
what men are accustomed to do, not what they ought to do .” 118 Hegel’s
judg - ment was intelligent and generous:</p>
<p>The Prince has often been cast aside with horror as containing</p>
<p>maxims of the most revolting tyranny; yet it was Machiavelli’s
high</p>
<p>sense of the necessity of constituting a state which caused him
to</p>
<p>lay down the principles on which alone states could be formed under
the circumstances. The isolated lords and lordships had to be en-</p>
<p>tirely suppressed; and though our idea of Freedom is incompatible</p>
<p>with the means which he proposes . . . including, as these do,
the</p>
<p>most reckless violence, all kinds of deception, murder, and the like
— yet we must confess that the despots who had to be subdued were</p>
<p>assailable in no other way . 120</p>
<p>And Macaulay, in a famous essay, pictured the philosophy of
Machiavelli as a natural reflex of an Italy brilliant and de-moral-ized,
and long since accustomed, by her despots, to the principles of The
Prince.</p>
<p>Machiavelli represents the ultimate challenge of a revived paganism
to a weakened Christianity. In his philosophy religion becomes again, as
in ancient Rome, the humble servant of a state which in effect is god.
The only virtues honored are pagan Roman virtues — courage, endurance,
self- reliance, intelligence; the only immortality is a fading fame.
Perhaps Ma- chiavelli exaggerated the enfeebling influence of
Christianity; had he for- gotten the lusty wars of medieval history, the
campaigns of Constantine, Belisarius, Charlemagne, the Templars, the
Teutonic Knights, and Julius II of recent memory? The Christian morality
emphasized the feminine vir- tues because men had the opposite qualities
in ruinous abundance; some antidote and counterideal had to be preached
to the sadistic Romans of the amphitheater, to the rough barbarians
entering Italy, to lawless peoples striving to subside into
civilization. The virtues that Machiavelli scorned made for orderly and
peaceful societies; those that he admired (and, like Nietzsche, because
he lacked them) made for strong and warlike states, and for dictators
capable of murdering by the million to enforce conformity, and of
incarnadining a planet to extend their rule. He confused the good of the
ruler with the good of the nation; he thought too much of the preser-
vation, seldom of the obligations, never of the corruption, of power. He
ignored the stimulating rivalry and cultural fertility of the Italian
city-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>566</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xstates; he cared little for the magnificent art of his time, or even
for that of ancient Rome. He was lost in idolatry of the state. He
helped to free the state from the Church, but he shared in setting up
for worship an atomistic nationalism not visibly superior to the
medieval notion of states subject to an international morality
represented by the pope. Each ideal has broken down under the natural
selfishness of men; and a candid Christian must ad- mit that in
preaching and practising the principle that no faith need be kept with a
heretic (as in violating the safe-conduct of Huss at Constance and of
Alfonso of Ferrara in Rome), the Church herself was playing a Machia-
vellian game fatal to her mission as a moral power.</p>
<p>And yet there is something stimulating in Machiavelli’s
forthrightness. Reading him, we are brought face to face, as nowhere
else so vividly, with a question that few philosophers had dared
discuss: is statesmanship bound by morality? We may come to at least one
conclusion: that morality can exist only among the members of a society
equipped to teach and enforce it; and that an interstate morality awaits
the formation of an international organization dowered with the physical
power and the public opinion to maintain an international law. Till then
the nations will be as beasts in the jungle; and whatever principles
their governments may profess, their prac- tice will be that of The
Prince.</p>
<p>Looking back upon two centuries of intellectual revolt in Italy
from</p>
<p>Petrarch to Machiavelli, we perceive that its essence and basis lay
simply in lessened concern for another world, and a rising affirmation
of life. Men were delighted to rediscover a pagan civilization whose
citizens were not worried about original sin or a punitive hell, and in
which the natural im- pulses were accepted as forgivable elements in a
vibrant society. Asceti- cism, self-abnegation, and the sense of sin
lost their hold, almost their mean- ing, in the upper strata of the
Italian population; monasteries languished for lack of novices, and
monks and friars and popes themselves sought the joys of the earth
rather than the stigmata of Christ. The bonds of tradition and authority
relaxed; the massive fabric of the Church weighed more lightly on the
thoughts and purposes of men. Life became more extrovert, and though
this often took the form of violence, it cleansed many souls of neurotic
fears and disorders that had darkened the medieval mind. The un-
fettered intellect disported itself happily in every field but science;
the exuberance of emancipation hardly comported, as yet, with the
discipline of experiment and the patience of research; that would come
in the con- structive aftermath of liberation. Meanwhile, among the
educated, the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE INTELLECTUAL REVOLT 567</p>
<p>practices of piety made room for the worship of intellect and genius;
the belief in immortality was commuted into the quest for enduring
renown. Pagan ideals like Fortune, Fate, and Nature encroached upon the
Christian conception of God.</p>
