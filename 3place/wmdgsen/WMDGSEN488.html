<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>XLuther and Erasmus</p>
<p>1 5 1 7S 6</p>
<p>I. LUTHER</p>
<p>H AVING summarized the economic, political, religious, moral, and</p>
<p>intellectual conditions that cradled the Reformation, we must
still</p>
<p>count it among the wonders of history that in Germany one man should
have unwittingly gathered these influences into a rebellion transforming
a conti- nent. We need not exaggerate the role of the hero here; the
forces of change would have found another embodiment had Luther
continued in his obedi- ence. Yet the sight of this rough monk, standing
in doubt and terror and immovable resolution against the most entrenched
institutions and most hallowed customs of Europe, stirs the blood, and
points again the distance that man has come from the slime or the
ape.</p>
<p>What was he like, this lusty voice of his time, this peak of German
history? In 1526, as pictured at forty-three by Lucas Cranach, 1 he was
in transition from slender to stout; very serious, with only a hint of
his robust humor; hair curly and still black; nose immense; eyes black
and brilliant — his enemies said that demons shone in them. A frank and
open countenance made him unfit for diplomacy. A later portrait (1532),
also by Cranach, showed Luther cheerfully obese, with a broad, full
face; this man enjoyed living. In 1524 he abandoned the monastic garb
and dressed like a layman, sometimes in the robes of a teacher,
sometimes in ordinary jacket and trousers. He was not above mending
these himself; his wife complained that the great man had cut a piece
out of his son’s pantaloons to patch his own.</p>
<p>He had slipped into marriage by inadvertence. He agreed with St. Paul
that it is better to marry than to burn, and proclaimed sex to be as
natural and necessary as eating. 2 He retained the medieval notion that
copulation is sinful even in marriage, but “God covers the sin.” 3 He
condemned virginity as a violation of the divine precept to increase and
multiply. If “a preacher of the Gospel . . . cannot live chastely
unmarried, let him take a wife; God has made that plaster for that
sore.” 4 He considered the human method of reproduction a bit absurd, at
least in retrospect, and suggested that “had God consulted me in the
matter, I should have advised Him to continue the veneration of the
species by fashioning human beings out of clay, as Adam</p>
<p>4i5</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>416</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xwas made.” B He had the traditional and German conception of woman
as divinely designed for childbearing, cooking, praying, and not much
else. “Take women from their housewifery, and they are good for
nothing.” 6 “If women get tired and die of bearing, there is no harm in
that; let them die as long as they bear; they are made for that.” 7 The
wife should give her husband love, honor, and obedience; he is to rule
her, though with kindness; she must keep to her sphere, the home; but
there she can do more with the children with one finger than the man
with two fists. 8 Between man and wife “there should be no question of
mine and thine”; all t heir possessions should be in common.®</p>
<p>Luther had the male’s usual dislike for an educated woman. “I wish,”
he said of his wife, “that women would repeat the Lord’s Prayer before
opening their mouths.” 10 But he despised writers who composed satires o
n women. “What defects women have we must check them for in private,
gently . . . for woman is a frail vessel.” 11 Despite his rough candor
about sex and mar - riage he was not insensible to esthetic
considerations. “The hair is the finest ornament women have. Of old,
virgins used to wear it loose, except when they were in mourning. I like
women to let their hair fall down their back; it is a most agreeable
sight.” 12 (This should have made him more lenient with Pope Alexander
VI, who fel l in love with Giulia Farnese’s loosened hair.)</p>
<p>Apparently it was for no physical need that Luther married. In a
burst of humor he said that he had married to please his father and
spite the Devil and the pope. But he took a long time to make up his
mind, and then it was made up for him. When, on his recommendation, some
nuns left their convent, he undertook to find them husbands. Finally
only one remained unmatched, Catherine von Bora, a woman of good birth
and character, but hardly de- signed to arouse precipitate passion. She
had set her sights on a young Wit- tenberg student of patrician stock;
she failed to get him, and entered domestic service to keep alive.
Luther suggested a Dr. Glatz as a husband; she replied that Glatz was
unacceptable, but that Herr Amsdorf or Dr. Luther would do. Luther was
forty-two, Catherine twenty-six; he thought the discrepancy prohibitive,
but his father urged him to transmit the family name. On June 27, 1525,
the ex-monk and the ex-nun became man and wife.</p>
<p>The Elector gave them the Augustinian monastery as a home, and raised
Luther’s salary to 300 guilders (,500) a year; later this was increased
to 400, then to 500. Luther bought a farm, which Katie managed and
loved. She bore him six children, and cared faithfully for them, for all
Martin’s domestic needs, for a home brewery, a fish pond, a vegetable
garden, chickens, and pigs. He called her “my lord Katie,” and implied
that she could put him in his place when he forgot the biological
subordination of man to woman; but she had much to bear from his
occasional storms and his trustful improvi- dence; for he cared nothing
for money, and was recklessly generous. He</p>
<p>CHAP, xrx) LUTHER AND ERASMUS 417</p>
<p>took no royalties for his books, though they made a fortune for his
publisher. His letters to or about Catherine reveal his growing
affection for her, and a generally happy marriage. He repeated in his
own way what had been told him in his youth: “The greatest gift of God
to man is a pious, kindly, God - fearing, home- loving wife.” 13</p>
<p>He was a good father, knowing as if by instinct the right mixture of
disci- pline and love. “Punish if you must, but let the sugar - plum go
with the rod.” 14 He composed songs for his children, and sang these
songs with them while he played the lute. His letters to his children
are among the jewels of German literature. His sturdy spirit, which
could face an emperor in war, was almost broken by the death of his
favorite daughter Magdalena at the age of four- teen. “God,” he said,
“has given no bishop so great a gift in a thousand years as He has given
me in her.” 15 He prayed night and day for her recovery. “I love her
very much, but, dear God, if it is Thy holy will to take her, I would
gladly leave her with Thee.” 16 And he said to her: “Lena dear, my
little daughter, thou wouldst love to remain here with thy father; art
thou willing to go to that other Father?” “Yes, dear father,” Lena
answered, “just as G od wills.” When she died he wept long and bitterly.
As she was laid in the earth</p>
<p>Not content with six children, he took into his many-chambered monas-
tery-home eleven orphaned nephews and nieces, brought them up, sat with
them at table, and discoursed with them tirelessly; Catherine mourned
their monopoly of him. Some of them made uncensored notes of his table
talk; the resulting mass of 6,596 entries rivals Boswell’s Johnson and
Napoleon’s recorded conversations in weight, wit, and wisdom. In judging
Luther we should remember that he never edited these Tischreden; few men
have been so completely exposed to the eavesdropping of mankind. Here,
rather than in the controversies of the theological battlefield, is
Luther chez lui, en pan- toufies, at home, himself.</p>
<p>We perceive, first of all, that he was a man, not an inkwell; he
lived as well as wrote. No healthy person will resent Luther’s relish
for good food and beer, or his fruitful enjoyment of all the comforts
that Catherine Bora could give him. He might have been more prudently
reticent on these points, but reticence came with the Puritans, and was
unknown to Renaissance Italians as well as to Reformation Germans; even
the delicate Erasmus shocks us with his candid physiological speech.
Luther ate too much, but he could punish himself with long fasts. He
drank too much, and deplored drinking as a na- tional vice; but beer was
the water of life to the Germans, as wine to the Italians and the
French; water could literally be poison in those careless days. Yet we
never hea r of his overstepping exuberance into intoxication. “If
God</p>
<p>418 the reformation (chap.xix</p>
<p>can forgive me for having crucified Him with Masses twenty years
running, he can also bear with me for occasionally taking a good drink
to honor Him .” 18</p>
<p>His faults leaped to the eye and the ear. Proud amid his constant
expres- sions of humility, dogmatic against dogma, intemperate in zeal,
giving no quarter of courtesy to his opponents, clinging to
superstitions while laughing at superstition, denouncing intolerance and
practicing it — here was no para- gon of consistency or Grandison of
virtue, but a man as contrary as life and scorched with the powder of
war. “I have not been slow to bite my adversar - ies,” he confessed,
“but what is the good of salt if it does not bite?” 19 He spoke of papal
decrees as Dreck, dung ; 20 of the pope as “the Devil’s sow” or
lieutenant, and as Antichrist; of bishops as “larvae,” unbelieving hypo
- crites, “ignorant apes”; of sacerdotal ordination as marking a man
with “the sign of the beast in the Apocalypse”; of monks as worse than
hangmen or murderers, or, at best, “fleas on God Almighty’s fur coat”;
21 we may surmise how his audiences enjoyed this hilarity. “TTie only
portion of the human anatomy which the pope has had to leave
uncontrolled is the hind end.” 22 Of the Catholic clergy he wrote: “The
Rhine is scarcely big enough to drown the whole accursed gang of Roman
extortioners . . . cardinals, arch- bishops, bishops, and abbots”; 23
or, water failing, “ma y it please God to send down upon them the rain
of fire and sulphur that consumed Sodom and Gomorrha .” 24 One is
reminded of the Emperor Julian’s comment: “There is no wild beast like
an angry theologian.” 26 But Luther, like Clive, marveled</p>
<p>Many think I am too fierce against popery; on the contrary I com-</p>
<p>plain that I am, alas, too mild; I wish I could breathe out
lightning</p>
<p>against pope and popedom, and that every wind were a thunder-</p>
<p>bolt. 26 . . . I will curse and scold the scoundrels until I go to my
grave, and never shall they have a civil word from me. . . . For I am
unable</p>
<p>to pray without at the same time cursing. If I am prompted to
say,</p>
<p>“Hallowed be Thy name,” I must add, “Cu rsed, damned, outraged</p>
<p>be the name of papists.” If I am prompted to say, “Thy Kingdom</p>
<p>come,” I must perforce add, “Cursed, damned, destroyed must be the
papacy.” Indeed, I pray thus orally every day and in my heart, with
-</p>
<p>out intermission . 27 … I never work better than when I am inspired
by anger. When I am angry I can write, pray, and preach well, for</p>
<p>then my whole temperament is quickened, my understanding sharp- ened
. 28</p>
<p>Such rhetorical passion was in the temper of the times. “Some of the
p reachers and pamphlet writers on the orthodox side,” confesses the
learned Cardinal Gasquet, “were Luther’s match in this respect.” 29
Vituperation was expected of intellectual gladiators, and was relished
by their audiences; po-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>LUTHER AND ERASMUS</p>
<p>liteness was suspected of cowardice. When Luther’s wife reproached
him —“Dear husband, you are too rude”— he answered, “A twig can be cut
with a bread knife, but an oak calls for an axe”; 80 a soft answer could
turn away wrath, but could not overturn the papacy. A man mollified to
refined speech would have shrunk from so mortal a combat. It took a
thick skin — thicker than Erasmus’— to slough off papal excommunications
and Imperial bans.</p>
<p>And it took a strong will. This was Luther’s bedrock; hence his self
-con- fidence, dogmatism, courage, and intolerance. But he had some
gentle virtues too. In his middle years he was the height of sociability
and cheerfulness, and a pillar of strength to all who needed consolation
or aid. He put on no airs, assumed no elegances, never forgot that he
was a peasant’s son. He depre - cated the publication of his collected
works, begging his readers to study the Bible instead. He protested
against applying the name Lutheran to the churches that followed his
lead. When he preached he turned his speech to the vocabulary and
understanding of his hearers. His humor was rural- rough, rollicking,
Rabelaisian. “My enemies examine all that I do,” he com - plained; “if I
break wind in Wittenberg they smell it in Rome.” 81 “Women wear veils
because of the angels; I wear trousers because of the girls .” 82 Many
of us have committed such quips, but have not had such merciless
reporters. The same man who uttered them loved music this side of
idolatry, composed tender or thundering hymns, and set them —
theological prejudice for a moment stilled — to polyphonic strains
already used in the Roman Church. “I would not give up my humble musical
gift for anything, however great. … I am quite of the opinion that . . .
next to theology, there is no art which can be compared to music; for it
alone, after theology, gives us . . . rest and joy of heart .” 83</p>
<p>His theology led him to a lenient ethic, for it told him that good
works could not win salvation without faith in redemption by Christ, nor
could sin forfeit salvation if such faith survived. A little sin now and
then, he thought, might cheer us up on the straight and narrow path.
Tired of seeing Melanchthon wear himself thin with gloomy scruples about
minor lapses from sanctity, he told him, with full-blooded humor, Pecca
fortiter — “Sin powerfully; God can forgive only a hearty sinner,” but
scorns the anemic casuist ; 34 yet it would be absurd to rear an
indictment of Luther on this incidental raillery. One thing is clear:
Luther was no puritan. “Our loving God wills that we eat, drink, and be
merry.” 35 “I seek and accept joy wher - ever I can find it. We now
know, ’hank God, that we can be happy with a good conscienc e .” 36 He
advised his followers to feast and dance on Sunday. He approved of
amusements, played a good game of chess, called card-play- ing a
harmless diversion for immature minds , 87 and said a wise word for
dancing: “Dances are instituted that court esy may be learned in
company, and that friendship and acquaintance may be contracted between
young men</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>42O</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xand girls; here their intercourse may be watched, and occasion of
honorable meeting given. I myself would attend them sometimes, but the
youth would whirl less giddily if I did.” 88 Some Protestant preachers
wished to prohibit plays, but Luther was more tolerant: “Christians must
not altogether shun plays because there are sometimes coarseness and
adulteries therein; for such reasons they would have to give up the
Bible too.” 39 All in all, Luther’s con - ception of life was remarkably
healthy and. cheerful for one who thought that “all natural inclinations
are either without God or against Him,” 40 and that nine of every ten
souls were divinely predestined to everlasting hell. 41 The man was
immeasurably better than his theology.</p>
<p>His intellect was powerful, but it was too clouded with the miasmas
of his youth, too incarnadined with war, to work out a rational
philosophy. Like his contemporaries, he believed in goblins, witches,
demons, the curative value of live toads, 42 and the impish incubi who
sought out maidens in their baths or beds and startled them into
motherhood. 43 He ridiculed astrology but sometimes talked in its terms.
He praised mathematics as “relying upon demonstrations and sure proofs”;
44 he admired the bold reach of astronomy into the stars, but, like
nearly all his contemporaries, he rejected the Copemi- can system as
contradicting Scripture. He insisted that reason should stay within the
limits laid down by religious faith.</p>
<p>Doubtless he was right in his judgment that feeling, rather than
thought, is the lever of history. The men who mold religions move the
world; the philosophers clothe in new phrases, generation after
generation, the sublime ignorance of the part pontificating about the
whole. So Luther prayed while Erasmus reasoned; and while Erasmus
courted princes Luther spoke to God — now imperiously, as one who had
fought strenuously in the battles of the Lord and had a right to be
heard, now humbly as a child lost in infinite space. Confident that God
was on his side, he faced insuperable obstacles, and won. “I bear upon
me the ma lice of the whole world, the hatred of the Em- peror, of the
Pope, and of all their retinue. Well, onward, in God’s name!” 48 He had
the courage to defy his enemies because he did not have the intellect to
doubt his truth. He was what he had to be to do what he had to do.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE INTOLERANT HERETICS</li>
</ol>
<p>It is instructive to observe how Luther moved from tolerance to dogma
as his power and certainty grew. Among the “errors” that Leo X, in the
bull Exsurge Domine, denounced in Luther was that “to burn heretics is
against the will of the Holy Spirit.” In the Open Letter to the
Christian Nobility ( 1520) Luther ordained “every man a priest,” with
the right to interpret the Bible according to his private judgment and
individual light; 49 and added,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) LUTHER AND ERASMUS 421</p>
<p>“We should vanquish heretics with books, not with burning.” 47 In the
essay On Secular Authority (1522) he wrote:</p>
<p>Over the soul God can and will let no one rule but Himself. . . .</p>
<p>We desire to make this so clear that everyone shall grasp it, and
that our Junkers , the princes and bishops, may see what fools they
are</p>
<p>when they seek to coerce the people . . . into believing one thing
or</p>
<p>another. . . . Since belief or unbelief is a matter of everyone’s con
-</p>
<p>science . . . the secular power should be content to attend to its
own affairs, and permit men to believe one thing or another as they
are</p>
<p>able and willing, and constrain no one by force. For faith is a
free</p>
<p>work, to which no one can be compelled. . . . Faith and heresy
are</p>
<p>never so strong as when men oppose them by sheer force, without</p>
<p>God’s word . 48</p>
<p>n a letter to Elector Frederick (April 21, 1524) Luther asked
toleration for Munzer and other of his own enemies. “You sho uld not
prevent them from speaking. There must be sects, and the Word of God
must face bat- tle Let us leave in His hands the combat and free
encounter of minds.”</p>
<p>In 1528, when others were advocating the death penalty for
Anabaptists, he advised that unless they were guilty of sedition they
should be merely ban- ished. 49 Likewise, in 1530, he recommended that
the death penalty for blas- phemy should be softened to exile. It is
true that even in these liberal years he talked as if he wished his
followers or God to drown or otherwise eliminate all “papists”; but this
was “campaign oratory,” not seriously meant. In Jan - uary 1 52 1, he
wrote: “I would not have the Gospel defended by violence or murder”; and
in June of that year he reproved the Erfur t students for attack- ing
priests; however, he did not object to “frightening them” a bit to
improve their theology. 50 In May 1529, he condemned plans for the
forcible conver- sion of Catholic parishes to Protestantism. As late as
153 1 he taught that “we neither can nor should force anyone into the
faith.” 51</p>
<p>But it was difficult for a man of Luther’s forceful and positive
character - tion. The transition to intolerance was easiest concerning
the Jews. Till 1537 Luther argued that they were to be forgiven for
keeping their own creed, “since our fools, the popes , bishops,
sophists, and monks, those coarse ass- heads, dealt with the Jews in
such a manner that any Christian would have preferred to be a Jew.
Indeed, had I been a Jew, and had seen such idiots and dunderheads
expound Christianity, I should rather have become a hog than a
Christian. … I would advise and beg everybody to deal kindly with the
Jews, and to instruct them in the Scripture; in such case we could
expect them to come over to us.” 52 Luther may have realized that
Protestantism was</p>
<p>422</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xin some aspects a return to Judaism, in its rejection of monasticism
and cleri- cal celibacy, its emphasis on the Old Testament, the
Prophets, and the Psalms, and its adoption (Luther himself excepted) of
a sterner sexual ethic than that of Catholicism. He was disappointed
when the Jews made no corresponding move toward Protestantism; and his
hostility to the charging of interest helped to turn him against Jewish
moneylenders, then against Jews in general. When Elector John expelled
the Jews from Saxony (1537) Luther rejected a Jewish appeal for his
intercession. In his Table Talk he united “Jews and papists” as “ungodly

declining years h e fell into a fury of anti-Semitism, denounced the
Jews as “a stiff - necked, unbelieving, proud, wicked, abominable
nation,” and demanded that their schools and synagogues should be razed
with fire.</p>

streets and highways be closed against them. Let them be forbidden to
prac- tice usury, and let all their money, and all their treasures of
silver and gold be taken from them and put away in safety. And if all
this be not enough, let them be driven like mad dogs out of the land.

<p>Luther should never have grown old. Already in 1522 he was
outpapaling the popes. “I do not admit,” he wrote, “that my doctrine can
be judged by anyone, even by the angels. He who does not receive my
doctrine cannot be saved.” 55 By 1529 he was drawing some delicate
distinctions:</p>
<p>No one is to be compelled to profess the faith, but no one must
be</p>
<p>allowed to injure it. Let our opponents give their objections and
hear our answers. If they are thus converted, well and good; if not, let
them hold their tongues and believe what they please. … In order to
avoid trouble we should not, if possible, suffer contrary teachings in
the</p>
<p>same state. Even unbelievers should be forced to obey the Ten Com-
mandments, attend church, and outwardly conform. 56</p>
<p>Luther now agreed with the Catholi c Church that “Christians require
cer - tainty, definite dogmas, and sure Word of God which they can trust
to live and die by.” 57 As the Church in the early centuries of
Christianity, divided and weakened by a growing multiplicity of
ferocious sects, had felt com- pelled to define her creed and expel all
dissidents, so now Luther, dismayed by the variety of quarrelsome sects
that had sprouted from the seed of pri- vate judgment, passed step by
step from toleration to dogmatism. “All men</p>
<p>LUTHER AND ERASMUS</p>
<p>CHAP, xrx)</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>now presume to criticize the Gospel,” he complained; “almost every
old doting fool or prating sophist must, forsooth, be a doctor of
divinity.” 68 Stung by Catholic taunts that he had let loose a
dissolvent anarchy of creeds and morals, he concluded, with the Church,
that social order required some cloture to debate, some recognized
authority to serve as “an anchor of faith.” What should that auth ority
be? The Church answered, the Church, for only a living organism could
adjust itself and its Scriptures to inescapable change. No, said Luther;
the sole and final authority should be the Bible itself, since all
acknowledge it to be the Word of God.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, in this infallible book, he
found an explicit command, allegedly from the mouth of God, to put
heretics to death: “Neither shalt thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou
conceal him,” even though it be “thy bro ther, or thy son, or the wife
of thy bosom . . . but thou shalt surely kill him, thy hand shall be the
first upon him to put him to death.” On that awful warrant the Church
had acted in annihilating the Albigensians in the thirteenth century;
that divine imprecation had been made a certificate of authority for the
burnings of the Inquisition. Despite the violence of Luther’s speech he
never rivaled the severity of the Church in dealing with dissent; but he
proceeded, within the area and limits of his power, to silence it as
peaceably as he could. In 1525 he invoked the aid of existing censorship
regulations in Saxony and Brandenburg to stamp out the “pernicious
doctrines” of the Anabaptists and the Zwinglians. 59 In 1530, in his
commentary on the Eighty-second Psalm, he advised governments to put to
death all heretics who preached sedition or against private property,
and “those who teach against a manifest article of the faith . . . like
the articles</p>
<p>Other reformers rivaled or surpassed Luther in hounding heresy. Bucer
of Strasbourg urged the civil authorities in Protestant states to
extirpate all who professed a “false” religion; such men, he said, are
worse than murderers; even their wives and children and cattle should be
destroyed. 82 The com- paratively gentle Melanchthon accepted the
chairmanship of the secular inquisition that suppressed the Anabaptists
of Germany with imprisonment or death. “Why should we pity such men more
than God does?” he asked, for he was convinced that God had destined all
Anabaptists to hell. 83 He</p>
<p>424 THE REFORMATION (chap.xix</p>
<p>recommended that the rejection of infant baptism, or of original sin,
or of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, should be punished
as capital crimes. 64 He insisted on the death penalty for a sectarian
who thought that heathens might be saved, or for another who doubted
that belief in Christ as the Redeemer could change a naturally sinful
into a righteous man. 65 He applauded, as we shall see, the execution of
Servetus. He asked the state to compel all the people to attend
Protestant religious services regularly. 66 He demanded the suppression
of all books that opposed or hindered Lutheran teaching; so the writings
of Zwingli and his followers were formally placed on the index of
prohibited books in Wittenberg. 67 Whereas Luther was con- tent with the
expulsion of Catholics from regions governed by Lutheran princes,
Melanchthon favored corporal penalties. Both agreed that the civil power
was in duty bound to promulgate and uphold “the law of God”— i.e.,
Lutheranism. 68 Luther, however, counseled that where two sects existed
in a state the minority should yield to the majority: in a predominantly
Catholic principality the Protestants should yield and emigrate; in a
prevailingly Protestant province the Catholics should give way and
depart; if they re- sisted, they should be effectively chastised. 69</p>
<p>The Protestant authorities, following Catholic precedents, accepted
the obligation of maintaining religious conformity. At Augsburg (January
18,</p>
<ol start="1537" type="1">
<li>the town council issued a decree forbidding the Catholic worship,
and banishing, after eight days, all who would not accept the new faith.
At the expiration of the period of grace the council sent soldiers to
take possession of all churches and monasteries; altars and statues were
removed, and priests, monks, and nuns were banished. 70
Frankfurt-am-Main promulgated a similar ordinance; and the seizure of
Catholic church properties, and the suppression of Catholic services,
spread through the states controlled by Protestants. 71 Censorship of
the press, already established in Catholic areas, was adopted by the
Protestants; so Elector John of Saxony, at the request of Luther and
Melanchthon, promulgated (1528) an edict that prohibited the
publication, sale, or reading of Zwinglian or Anabaptist literature, or
the preaching or teaching of their doctrines; “and anyone who is aware
of such being done by anybody, whether a stranger or an acquaintance,
must give information to the . . . magistrates of the place, in order
that the offender may be taken up in due time and punished. . . . Those
who are aware of such breeches of the orders . . . and do not give
information, shall be punished by loss of life or property.” 72</li>
</ol>
<p>Excommunication, like censorship, was adopted by the Protestants from
the Catholics. The Augsburg Confession of 1530 proclaimed the right of
the Lutheran Church to excommunicate any member who should reject a
funda- mental Lutheran doctrine. 73 Luther e xplained that “although
excommunica - tion in popedom has been and is shamefully abused, and
made a mere torment,</p>
<p>LUTHER AND ERASMUS</p>

<p>42 5</p>
<p>yet we must not suffer it to fall, but make right use of it, as
Christ com- manded.” 74</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE HUMANISTS AND THE REFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>The intolerant dogmatism of the Reformers, their violence of speech,
their sectarian fragmentation and animosities, their destruction of
religious art, their predestinarian theology, their indifference to
secular learning, their renewed emphasis on demons and hell, their
concentration on personal salva- tion in a life beyond the grave — all
these shared in alienating the humanists from the Reformation. Humanism
was a pagan reversion to classical culture; Protestantism was a pious
return to gloomy Augustine, to early Christianity, even to Old Testament
Judaism; the long contest between Hellenism and Hebraism was renewed.
The humanists had made remarkable headway within the Catholic fold; in
Nicholas V and Leo X they had captured the papacy; popes had not only
tolerated but protected them, and had helped them to recover lost
treasures of classic literature and art — all on the tacit understanding
that their writings would be addressed, presumably in Latin, to the
educated classes, and would not upset the orthodoxy of the people.
Disturbed now in this cozy entente, the humanists found that Teutonic
Eu- rope cared less for them and their aristocratic culture than for the
soul- warm- ing talk of the new vernacular preachers about God and hell
and individual salvation. They laughed at the passionate debates of
Luther and Eck, Luther and Carlstadt, Luther and Zwingli, as battles
over issues that they had thought long dead or courteously forgotten.
They had no taste for theology; heaven and hell had become myths to
them, less real than the mythology of Greece and Rome. Protestantism, as
they saw it, was treason to the Renaissance, was restoring all the
supematuralism, irrationalism, and diabolism that had dark- ened the
medieval mind; this, they felt, was not progress but reaction; it was
the resubjection of the emancipated mind to the primitive myths of the
populace. They resented Luther’s vituper ation of reason, his exaltation
of a faith that was now to be dogmatically defined by Protestant
popelets or potentates. And what remained of that human dignity which
Pico della Mirandola had so nobly described, if everything that happened
on the earth — every heroism, every sacrifice, every advance in human
decency and worth — was merely the mechanical fulfillment, by helpless
and meaningless men, of God’s foreknowledge and inescapable decrees?</p>
<p>Humanists who had criticized, but never left, the Church —
Wimpheling, Beatus Rhenanus, Thomas Mumer, Sebastian Brant — now
hastened to con- firm their loyalty. Many humanists who had applauded
Luther’s initial re - bellion as the wholesome correction of a shameful
abuse drew away from him as Protestant theology and polemics took form.
Willibald Pirkheimer, Hel-</p>
<p>4.26 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xlenist and statesman, who had so openly supported Luther that he had
been excommunicated in the first draft of the bull Exsurge Domine, was
shocked by Luther’s violence of speech, and dissociated himself from the
revolt. In 1529, while still critical of the Church, he wrote:</p>
<p>I do not deny that at the beginning all Luther’s acts did not
seem</p>
<p>to be vain, since no good man could be pleased with all those errors
and impostures that had accumulated gradually in Christianity. So,</p>
<p>with others, I hoped that some remedy might be applied to such great
evils; but I was cruelly deceived. For, before the former errors had</p>
<p>been extirpated, far more intolerable ones crept in, compared
with</p>
<p>which the others seemed child’s play. . . . Things have come to a
pass that the popish scoundrels are made to appear virtuous by the Evan-
gelical ones. . . . Luther, with his shameless, ungovernable tongue,</p>
<p>must have lapsed into insanity, or been inspired by the Evil Spirit .
75</p>
<p>Mutianus agreed. He had hailed Luther as the “morning star of Witten
- berg”; soon he was complaining that Luther “had all the fury of a
maniac.” 76 Crotus Rubianus, who had opened a path for Luther by the
Letters of Ob- scure Men, fled back to the Church in 1 52 1 . Reuchlin
sent Luther a courteous letter, and prevented Eck from burning Luther’s
books in Ingolstadt; but he scolded his nephew Melanchthon for adopting
the Lutheran theology, and he died in the arms of the Church. Johannes
Dobenek Cochlaeus, at first for Luther, turned against him in 1522, and
addressed to him a letter of reproach:</p>
<p>Do you suppose that we wish to excuse or defend the sins and</p>
<p>wickedness of the clergy? God save us! — we would far rather help</p>
<p>you to root them out, as far as it can be done legitimately. . . .
But</p>
<p>Christ does not teach such methods as you are carrying on so offen-
sively with “Antichrist,” “brothels,” “Devil’s nests,” “cesspools,”
and</p>
<p>other unheard-of terms of abuse, not to speak of your threatenings of
sword, bloodshed, and murder. O Luther, you were never taught this
method of working by Christ! 77</p>
<p>The humanists of Germany had perhaps forgotten the scurrility of
their Italian predecessors — Filelfo, Poggio, and many more — which had
set a pace for Luther’s contumelious pen. But the style of Luther’s
warfare was only the surface of their indictment. They noted — as Luther
noted — a deteriora- tion of morals and manners in Germany, and ascribed
it to the disruption of ecclesiastical authority, and the Lutheran
discounting of “good works” as a merit for salvation. They were hurt by
the Protestant derogation of learning, Carlstadt’s equating of pundit
and peasant, Luther’s slighting of scholarship and erudition. Erasmus
voiced the general view of the humanists — and here Melanchthon sadly
concurred 78 — that wherever Lutheranism triumphed, let- ters (i.e.,
education and literature) declined. 79 The Protestants retorted that</p>
<p>LUTHER AND ERASMUS</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>this was merely because learning, to the humanist, meant chiefly the
study of pagan classics and history. For a generation the books and
pamphlets of religious polemics so absorbed the mind and presses of
Germany and Switz- erland that nearly every other form of literature
(except the satire) lost its audience. Publishing firms like Froben’s in
Basel and the Atlansee in Vienna found so few purchasers for the learned
works that they had issued at great cost that they verged on bankruptcy.
80 Rival fanaticisms stifled the young German Renaissance, and the trend
of Renaissance Christianity toward rec- onciliation with paganism came
to an end.</p>
<p>Some humanists, like Eoban Hess and Ulrich von Hutten, remained
faith- ful to the Reformation. Hess wandered from post to post, returned
to Erfurt to find the university deserted (1533), and died professing
poetry at Mar- burg (1540). Hutten, after the fall of Sickingen, fled to
Switzerland, robbing for his food on the way. 81 Destitute and diseased,
he sought out Erasmus at Basel (1522), though he had publicly branded
the humanist as a coward for not joining the Reformers. 82 Erasmus
refused to see him, alleging the inade- quacy of his stove to warm
Hutten’s bones. The poet now composed An Expostulation denouncing
Erasmus as a chicken-hearted renegade; he offered to withhold it from
publication if Erasmus would pay him; Erasmus balked, and urged upon
Hutten the wisdom of settling their differences peaceably. But Hutten
had allowed the manuscript of his lampoon to circulate privately; it
came to Erasmus’ knowledge, and moved him to join the clergy of Basel in
urging the city council to banish the irascible satirist. Hutten sent
the Expostulation to the press, and moved to Mulhouse. There a mob
gathered to attack his refuge; he fled again, and was taken in by
Zwingli at Zurich (June 1533). “Behold,” said the Reform er, here more
humane than the humanist, “behold this destroyer, the terrible Hutten,
whom we see so fond of the people and of children! This mouth, which
blew storms upon the pope, breathes nothing but gentleness and
goodness.” 83 Meanwhile Erasmus replied to the Expostulation in a
hastily written Spongia Erasmi adversus aspergmes Hutteni ( Erasmus ’
Sponge on Hutten’s Aspersions); and he wrote to the town council of
Zurich protesting against the “lies” Hutten had told of him, and
recommending the po et’s banishment. 84 But Hutten was now dying; the
war of ideas and the ravages of syphilis had exhausted him. He breathed
his last (August 29, 1523) on an island in the Lake of Zurich, being
thirty-five years old, and possessing nothing but his clothes and a
pen.</p>

<p>The reaction of Erasmus to the Reformation provides a living debate
among historians and philosoohers. Which method was the better for</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xmankind — Luther’s direct attack upon the Church, or Erasmus’ policy
of peaceful compromise and piecemeal reform? The answers almost define
two types of personality: “tough - minded” warriors of action and will,
“tender - minded” compromisers given to feeli ng and thought. Luther was
basically a man of action; his thoughts were decisions, his books were
deeds. His think- ing was early medieval in content, early modem in
result; his courage and decisiveness, rather than his theology,
co-operated with nationalism to estab- lish the modern age. Luther spoke
in masculinely vigorous German to the German people, and aroused a
nation to overthrow an international power; Erasmus wrote in femininely
graceful Latin for an international audience, a cosmopolitan elite of
university graduates. He was too sensitive to be a man of action; he
praised and longed for peace while Luther waged and relished war. He was
a master of moderation, deprecating intemperance and extravagance. He
fled from action into thought, from rash certainties into cautious
doubt. He knew too much to see truth or error all on one side; he saw
both sides, tried to bring them together, and was crushed in
between.</p>
<p>He applauded Luther’s Theses. In March 1518, he sent copies of them
to Colet and More, and wrote to Colet: “The Roman Curia has cast aside
all shame. What is more impudent than these indulgences?” 86 In October
he wrote to another friend:</p>
<p>I hear that Luther is approved by all good men, but it is said
that</p>
<p>his writings are unequal. I think his Theses will please all, except
a few about purgatory, which they who make their living from it
don’t</p>
<p>want taken from them. … I perceive that the monarchy of the Roman
high priest (as that see now is) is the plague of Christendom, though it
is praised through thick and thin by shameless preachers. Yet I</p>
<p>hardly know whether it is expedient to touch this open sore, for that
is the duty of princes; but I fear that they conspire with the
pontiff</p>
<p>for part of the spoils. 86</p>
<p>For the most part Erasmus lived now in Louvain. He shared in founding
at the university the Collegium Trilingue, with professorships in Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew. In 1519 Charles V gave him a pension. Erasmus made it
a condition of acceptance that he was to keep his independence of body
and mind; but if he was human this pension, added to those that he was
receiving from Archbishop Warham and Lord Mount joy, must have played
some part in molding his attitude toward the Reformation.</p>
<p>As Luther’s revolt pass ed from criticism of indulgences to rejection
of papacy and councils, Erasmus hesitated. He had hoped that Church
reform could be advanced by appealing to the good will of the humanist
pope. He still revered the Church as (it seemed to him) an irreplaceable
foundation of social order and individual morality; and though he
believed that the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) LUTHER AND ERASMUS 429</p>
<p>orthodox theology was shot through with nonsense, he had no trust in
the wisdom of private or popular judgment to develop a more beneficent
ritual or creed; the progress of reason could come only through the
percolation of enlightenment from the instructed few to the emulous
many. He acknowl- edged his share in opening a path for Luther; his own
Praise of Folly was at that moment circulating by the thousands
throughout Europe, pointing scorn at monks and theologians, and giving
sharp point to Luther’s blunt tirades. When the monks and theologians
charged him with laying the egg that Luther hatched, he answered, wryly:
“Yes, but the egg I laid was a hen, whereas Luther has hatched a
gamecock.” 87 Luther himself had read the Praise of Folly, and nearly
everything else published by Erasmus, and he told his friends that he
was merely giving more direct form to what the famous humanist had said
or hinted for many years past. On March 1 8, 1 5 1 9, he wrote to
Erasmus humbly and reverently, soliciting his friendship and, by
implication, his support.</p>
<p>Erasmus had now to make one of the pivotal decisions of his life, and
either horn of the dilemma seemed fatal. If he renounced Luther he would
be called a coward. If he associated himself with Luther in rejecting
the Roman Church he would not merely forfeit three pensions and the pro-
tection that Leo X had given him against obscurantist theologians; he
would have to abandon his own plan and strategy of Church reform through
the improvement of minds and morals in influential men. Already he had
(he thought) made real progress on this line with the Pope, Archbishop
Warham, Bishop Fisher, Dean Colet, Thomas More, Francis I, Charles V.
These men, of course, would never consent to renounce the Church; they
would shrink from disrupting an institution which in their view was
inextricably allied with princely government in maintaining social
stability; but they could be enlisted in a campaign to reduce the
superstitions and horrors in the pre- vailing cult, to cleanse and
educate the clergy, to control and subordinate the monks, and to protect
intellectual freedom for the progress of the mind. To exchange that
program for a violent division of Christendom into warring halves, and
for a theology of predestination and the unimportance of good works,
would seem to these men, and seemed to Erasmus, the way to mad-
ness.</p>
<p>He hoped that peace might still be restored if all parties would
lower their voices. In February 1519, he advised Froben to publish no
more of Luthe r’s works, as being too inflammatory. 88 In April he wrote
to Elector Frederick encouraging him to protect Luther as more sinned
against than sinning. 88 Finally (May 30) he answered Luther:</p>
<p>Dearest brother in Christ, your epistle, showing the keenness of</p>
<p>your mind and breathing a Christian spirit, was most pleasant to
me.</p>

approve nor disapprove of your writings, but that they should read</p>
<p>them before they speak so loudly. I suggested, too, that the subjects

<p>Despite this cautious ambivalence the theologians of Louvain
continued to attack Erasmus as the fountainhead of the Lutheran flood.
On October 8, 1520, Aleander arrived, posted the papal bull
excommunicating Luther, and scored Erasmus as a secret fomenter of the
revolt. The pundits accepted Aleander’s lead, and expelled Erasmus from
the Louvain faculty (October</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) LUTHER AND ERASMUS 43 1</p>
<p>1 perceived that the better a man was, the less he was Luther’s</p>
<p>enemy. … A few persons only were clamoring at him in alarm for</p>

his faults. . . . How, while there are persons calling themselves

braver than princes, especially when I can do nothing. The corruption
of</p>
<p>the Roman court may require reform extensive and immediate, but I and
the like of me are not called on to take a work like that upon</p>
<p>themselves. I would rather see things left as they are than see a</p>
<p>revolution that may lead to one knows not what You may assure</p>
<p>yourself that Erasmus has been, and always will be, a faithful
subject of the Roman See. But I think, and many will think with me,
that</p>
<p>there would be a better chance of a settlement if there were less</p>
<p>ferocity, if the management should be placed in the hands of men of
weight and learning, if the Pope would follow his own disposition</p>
<p>and would not let himself be influenced by others. 92</p>
<p>Luther made it more and more difficult for Erasmus to intercede for
him, since with each month the violence of his speech increased, until
in July 1520, he invited his readers to wash their hands in the blood of
bishops and cardinals. When news came that Luther had publicly burned
Leo’s bull of excommunication, Erasmus confessed himself shocked. On
January 15,1521, the Pope sent him a letter expressing pleasure in his
loyalty; at the same time Leo sent instructions to Aleander to treat the
humanist with every courtesy. As the Diet of Worms approached, a German
prince asked Erasmus to come to Luther’s help, but he replied that it
was too late. He regretted Luther’s refusal to submit; such submission,
he thought, would have furthered the movement for reform; now he feared
civil war. In February 152 1, he wrote to a friend:</p>
<p>Everyone confessed that the Church suffered under the tyranny</p>
<p>of certain men, and many were taking counsel to remedy this state</p>
<p>of affairs. Now this man has arisen to treat the matter in such a way
. . . that no one dares to defend even what he has said well. Six

<p>4?2 THE REFORM ATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xago I warned him to beware of hatred. The Babylonian Captivity has
alienated many from him, and he daily puts forth more atrocious</p>
<p>things. 93</p>
<p>Luther now abandoned hope of Erasmus’ support, and put him aside as a
cowardly pacifist who “thinks that all can be accomplished with civility
and benevolence,” 94 At the same time, and despite Leo’s instructions,
Alean - der and the Louvain theologians continued to attack Erasmus as a
secret Lutheran. Disgusted, he moved to Basel (November 15, 1521), where
he hoped to forget the young Reformation in the old Renaissance. Basel
was the citadel of Swiss humanism. Here labored Beatus Rhenanus, who
edited Tacitus and Pliny the Younger, discovered Velleius Paterculus,
and superin- tended the printing of Erasmus’ New Testament. Here were
printers and publishers who were also scholars, like Hans Amerbach and
that saint among publishers, Johann Froben(ius), who wore himself out
over his presses and texts, and (said Erasmus) “left his family more
honor than for - t une.” 95 Here Diirer lived for years; here Holbein
made breath -taking por- traits of Froben and Bonifacius Amerbach — who
gathered the art collection now in the Basel Museum. Seven years before,
on an earlier visit, Erasmus had described the circle with fond
exaggeration:</p>
<p>I seem to be living in some charming sanctuary of the Muses, where a
multitude of learned persons . . . appears as a matter of course. No one
is ignorant of Latin, none of Greek; most of them know Hebrew.</p>
<p>This one excels in the study of history, that one is deeply versed
in</p>
<p>theology, one is skilled in mathematics, another is a student of
antiq- uity, another is learned in the law. Certainly up to this time it
has</p>
<p>never been my good fortune to live in such an accomplished
society.</p>
<p>. . . What a sincere friendship prevails among them all, what

Holbein’s masterpiece. Standing at a table writing, wrapped in a heavy
fur-trimmed coat, hooded with a beret covering half of each ear, the
greatest of the humanists betrays in his premature age (he was now
fifty-seven) the toll taken by ill health, a peripatetic life of
controversy, and the spiritual loneli- ness and grief brought on by his
attempt to be fair to both sides in the dog- matic conflicts of his
time. Disheveled strays of white hair emerge from the beret. Grim, thin
lips; features refined but strong; a sharp, ferreting nose; heavy
eyelids almost closed on tired eyes; here, in one of the greatest of all
portraits, is the Renaissance slain by the Reformation.</li>

<p>LUTHER AND ERASMUS</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>On December i, 1522, the new pope, Adrian VI, wrote to Erasmus in
terms suggestive of the extraordinary influence with which both sides
credited him:</p>
<p>It lies with you, God helping, to recover those who have been</p>
<p>seduced by Luther from the right road, and to hold up those who</p>
<p>still stand I need not tell you with what joy I shall receive
back</p>
<p>these heretics without need to smite them with the rod of the Im-</p>
<p>perial law. You know how far are such rough methods from my own
nature. I am still as you knew me when we were students together.</p>
<p>Come to me in Rome. You will find here the books which you will</p>
<p>need. You will have myself and other learned men to consult with;</p>
<p>and if you will do what I ask you shall have no cause for regret.
97</p>
<p>After a preliminary exchange of letters pledging each other to
secrecy, Erasmus opened his heart to the Pope:</p>
<p>Your Holiness requires my advice, and you wish to see me. I would</p>
<p>go to you with pleasure if my health allowed. … As to writing</p>
<p>against Luther, I have not learning enough. You think my words
will</p>
<p>have authority. Alas, my popularity, such as I had, is turned to
hatred.</p>
<p>Once I was Prince of Letters, Star of Germany . . . High Priest
of</p>
<p>Learning, Champion of a Purer Theology. The note is altered now.</p>
<p>One party says I agree with Luther because I do not oppose him; the
other finds fault with me because I oppose him. … At Rome and in</p>
<p>Brabant I am called heretic, heresiarch, schismatic. I entirely
disagree with Luther. They quote this and that to show we are alike. I
could</p>
<p>find a hundred passages where St. Paul seems to teach the doctrines
which they condemn in Luther. . . .</p>
<p>Those counsel you best who advise gentle measures. The monks</p>
<p>-Atlases they call themselves of a tottering Church — estrange those
who would be its supporters. . . . Some think there is no remedy but
force. That is not my opinion . . . there would be frightful
bloodshed.</p>
<p>The question is not what heresy deserves, but how to deal with it</p>
<p>wisely. … For myself, I should say, discover the roots of the
disease.</p>
<p>Clean out those to begin with. Punish no one. Let what has taken
place be regarded as a chastisement sent by Providence, and grant a
general amnesty. If God forgives my sins, God’s vicar may forgive.
The</p>
<p>magistrates may prevent revolutionary violence. If possible,
there</p>
<p>should be a check on the printing presses. Then let the world
know</p>
<p>and see that you mean in earnest to reform the abuses which are
justly cried out against. If your Holiness desires to know what are the
roots to which I refer, send persons whom you can trust to every part
of</p>
<p>Latin Christendom. Let them consult the wisest men they can find</p>
<p>in the different countries; and you will soon know. 08</p>
<p>434 THE reformation (chap.xix</p>
<p>Poor Adrian, whose good intentions outran his powers, died broken-
hearted in 1523. His successor, Clement VII. continued to urge Erasmus
to enter the lists against Luther. When finally the scholar yielded, it
was with no personal attack on Luther, no general indictment of the
Reformation, but by an objective and mannerly discussion of free will (
De liber 0 ar bitrio,</p>
<p>1524). He admitted that he could not fathom the mystery of moral
freedom, nor reconcile it with divine omniscience and omnipotence. But
no humanist could accept the doctrines of predestination and determinism
without sacri- ficing the dignity and value of man or of human life:
here was another basic cleavage between the Reformation and the
Renaissance. To Erasmus it seemed obvious that a God who punished sins
that His creatures as made by Him could not help committing, was an
immoral monster unworthy of worship or praise; and to ascribe such
conduct to Christ’s “Father in heaven” would be the direst blasphemy. On
Luther’s assumptions the worst criminal would be an innocent martyr,
fated to sin by an act of God, and then con- demned by divine vengeance
to eternal suffering. How could a believer in predestination make any
creative effort, or labor to improve the condition of mankind? Erasmus
confessed that a ma n’s moral choice is fettered by a thousand
circumstances over which he has had no control; yet man’s con -
sciousness persists in affirming some measure of freedom, without which
he would be a meaningless automaton. In any case, Erasmus concluded, let
us admit our ignorance, our incapacity to reconcile moral freedom with
divine prescience or omnipresent causality; let us postpone the solution
to the Last Judgment; but meanwhile let us shun any hypothesis that
makes man a puppet, and God a tyrant cruder than any in history.</p>
<p>Clement VII sent Erasmus 200 florins (,000?) on receiving the
treatise. Most Catholics were disappointed by the conciliatory and
philosophical tone of the book; they had hoped for an exhilarating
declaration of war. Melanch- thon, who had expressed predestinarian
views in his Loci communes , was favorably impressed by Erasmus’
argument, and omitted the doctrine in later editions; 99 he, too, still
hoped for peace. But Luther, in a delayed re- sponse entitled De servo
arbitrio (1525), defended predestination uncom- promisingly:</p>
<p>The human will is like a beast of burden. If God mounts it, it
wishes</p>
<p>and goes as God wills; if Satan mounts it, it wishes and goes as
Satan wills. Nor can it choose its rider. . . . The riders contend for
its posses- sion. . . . God foresees, foreordains, and accomplishes all
things by an unchanging, eternal, and efficacious will. By this
thunderbolt free</p>
<p>will sinks shattered in the dust . 190</p>
<p>It is significant of the sixteenth-century mood that Luther rejected
free will not, as some eighteenth-century thinkers would do, because it
ran counter to</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) LUTHER AND ERASMUS 435</p>
<p>a universal reign of law and causality, nor, as many in the
nineteenth century would do, because heredity, environment, and
circumstance seemed to de- termine, like another trinity, the desires
that seem to determine the will. He rejected free will on t he ground
that God’s omnipotence makes Him the real cause of all events and all
actions, and that consequently it is He, and not our virtue or our sins,
Who decides our salvation or damnation. Luther faces the bitterness of
his logic manfully:</p>
<p>Common sense and natural reason are highly offended that God</p>
<p>by His mere wi’ 11 deserts, hardens, and damns, as if He delighted in
sin and in such eternal torments, He Who is said to be of such mercy and
goodness. Such a concept of God seems wicked, cruel, and intol- erable,
and by it many men have been revolted in all ages. I myself</p>
<p>was once offended to the very depth of the abyss of desperation,</p>
<p>so that I wished that I had never been created. There is no use
trying to get away from this by ingenious distinctions. Natural
reason,</p>
<p>however much it is offended, must admit the consequences of the</p>
<p>omniscience and omnipotence of God. … If it is difficult to
believe</p>
<p>in God’s mercy and goodness when He damns those who do not</p>
<p>deserve it, we must recall that if God’s justice could be
recognized</p>
<p>as just by human comprehension, it would not be divine. 101</p>
<p>Typical again of the age was the wide sale that this treatise On the
Slave Will had in the seven Latin and two vernacular editions that were
called for within a year. In the sequel this proved the great source
book of Protes- tant theology; here Calvin found the doctrine of
predestination, election, and reprobation which he transmitted to
France, Holland, Scotland, Eng- land, and America. Erasmus answered
Luther in two minor tracts, Hyper - aspistes (The Defender) I and II
(1526-27), but contemporary opinion gave the Reformer the better of the
argument.</p>
<p>Even at this stage Erasmus continued his efforts for peace. To his
corre- spondents he recommended tolerance and courtesy. He thought that
the Church should permit clerical marriage and communion in both kinds;
that she should yield some of her vast properties to lay authorities and
uses; and that such divisive questions as predestination, free will, and
the Real Presence should be left undefined, open to diverse
interpretations. 102 He advised Duke George of Saxony to treat the
Anabaptists humanely; “it is not just to punish with fire any error
whatever, unless there be joined to it sedition or some other crime such
as the laws punish with death.” 103 This was in 1524; in 1533, however,
moved by friendship or senility, he defended the imprison- ment of
heretics by Thomas More. 104 In Spain, where some humanists had become
Erasmians, the monks of the Inquisition began a systematic scrutiny of
Erasmus’ works, with a view to having him condemned as a heretic (1527).
Nevertheless he continued his criticism of monastic immorality and</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>436</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xtheological dogmatism as main provocatives of the Reformation. In
1528 he repeated the charge that “many convents, both of men and women,
are public brothels,” and “in many monasteries the last virtue to be
found is chastity.” 105 In 1532 he condemned the monks as importunate
beggars, seducers of women, hounders of heretics, hunters of legacies,
forgers of testimonials. 106 He was all for reforming the Church while
deprecating the Reformation. He could not bring himself to leave the
Church, or to see her torn in half. “I endure the Church till the day I
shall see a better one.” 107</p>
<p>He was dismayed when he heard of the sack of Rome by Protestant and
Catholic troops in the service of the Emperor (1527); he had hoped that
Charles would encourage Clement to compromise with Luther; now Pope and
Emperor were at each other’s throats. A closer shock came when, in a
pious riot, the reformers at Basel destroyed the images in the churches
(1529). Only a year before, he himself had denounced die worship of
images: “the people should be taught that these are no more than signs;
it would be better if there were none at all, and prayer were addressed
only to Christ. But in all things let there be moderation” 108 : this
was precisely, on this point, the position of Luther. But the incensed
and senseless denudation of churches seemed to him an illiberal and
barbarous reaction. He left Basel and moved to Freiburg-im-Breisgau, in
Catholic Austrian territory. The city authorities received him with
honors, and gave him the unfinished palace of Maximilian I for a
residence. When the Imperial pension came too irregularly the Fuggers
sent him whatever funds he needed. But the monks and theologians of
Freiburg attacked him as a secret skeptic, and as the real cause of the
turmoil in Germany. In 1535 he returned to Basel. A delegation of
university professors went out to welcome him, and Jerome Froben, son of
Johann, gave him rooms in his home.</p>
<p>He was now sixty-nine, thin, with features drawn taut with age. He
suf- fered from ulcers, diarrhea, pancreatitis, gout, stone, and
frequent colds; note the swollen hands in Diirer’s drawing. In his final
year he was confined to his rooms, often to his bed. Harassed with pain,
and hearing almost daily of fresh attacks made upon him by Protestants
and Catholics, he lost the habitual good cheer that had endeared him to
his friends, and became morose. Yet, almost daily, letters of homage
came to him from kings, prelates, statesmen, scholars, or financiers,
and his dwelling was a goal of literary pilgrimage. On June 6, 1536, he
was stricken with acute dysentery. He knew himself to be dying, but he
did not ask for a priest or confessor, and passed away (June 12) without
the sacraments of the Church, repeatedly invoking the names of Mary and
Christ. Basel gave him a princely funeral and a tomb in the cathedral.
The humanists, the printers, and the bishop of the city joined in
erecting over his remains a stone slab, still in place, com- memorating
his “incomparable erudition in every branch of learning” His</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) LUTHER AND ERASMUS 437</p>
<p>will left no legacy for religious purposes, but assigned sums for the
care of the sick or the old, for providing dowries for poor girls, and
for the educa- tion of promising youths.</p>
<p>His standing with posterity fluctuated with the prestige of the
Renais- sance. Almost all parties, in the fever of religious revolution,
called him a trimmer and a coward. The Reformers charged him with having
led them to the brink, inspired them to jump, and then taken to his
heels. At the Council of Trent he was branded as an impious heretic, and
his works were forbidden to Catholic readers. As late as 1758 Horace
Walpole termed him “a begging parasite, who had parts enough to discover
the truth, and not courage enough to profess it.” 109 Late in the
nineteenth century, as the smoke of battle cleared, a learned and
judicious Protestant historian mourned that the Erasmian conception of
reform, “a scholar’s conception . . . was soon interrupted and set aside
by ruder and more drastic methods. Yet it may be questioned whether,
after all, the slow way is not in the long run the surest, and whether
any other agent of human progress can permanently be substituted for
culture. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was Luther’s work; but
if any fresh Reformation is . . . coming, it can only be based on the
principles of Erasmus.” 110 And a Cathol ic historian adds an almost
rationalistic appreciation: “Erasmus belonged, intellectually, to a</p>
