<h4 id="chapter-xiii">CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<p>Western Islam</p>
<p>641-1086</p>
<p>I. THE CONQUEST OF AFRICA</p>
<p>T HE Near East was but a part of the Islamic world. Egypt under
the</p>
<p>Moslems resurrected her Pharaonic glory; Tunis, Sicily, and Morocco
recovered orderly government under Arab leadership, and a passing bril-
liance illuminated Qairwan, Palermo, and Fez; Moorish Spain was a peak
in the history of civilization; and later the Moslem Moguls, ruling
India, would “build like giants and finish like jewelers.”</p>
<p>While Khalid and other conquerors subdued the East, Amr ibn al-As,
only seven years after Mohammed’s death, set out from Gaza in Palestine,
cap - tured Pelusium and Memphis, and marched upon Alexandria. Egypt had
ports and naval bases, and Arab power needed a fleet; Egypt exported
corn to Constantinople, and Arabia needed corn. The Byzantine government
in Egypt had for centuries used Arab mercenaries as police; these were
no hin- drance to the conquerors. The Monophysite Christians of Egypt
had suffered Byzantine persecution; they received the Moslems with open
arms, helped them to take Memphis, guided them into Alexandria. When it
fell to Amr after a siege of twenty-three months (641), he wrote to the
Caliph Omar: “It is impossible to enumerate the riches of this great
city, or to describe its beauty; I shall content myself with observing
that it contains 4000 palaces, 400 baths, 400 theaters.” 1 Amr prevented
pillage, pref erring taxation. Unable to understand the theological
differences among the Christian sects, he for- bade his Monophysite
allies to revenge themselves upon their orthodox foes, and upset the
custom of centuries by proclaiming freedom of worship for all.</p>
<p>Did Amr destroy the Alexandrian Library? The earliest mention of this
story is found in Abd al-Latif (1162-1231), a Moslem scientist; 2 it is
more fully given in Bar-Hebraeus ( 1 2 26-86) , a Christianized Jew of
eastern Syria, who wrote in Arabic, under the name of Abu- ’l -Faraj, an
epitome of world history. In his account an Alexandrian grammarian, John
Philoponus, asked Amr to give him the manuscripts of the library; Amr
wrote to Omar for permission; the Caliph, we are told, replied: “If
these wr itings of the Greeks agree with the Book of God, they are
useless, and need not be preserved; if they disagree they are
pernicious, and should be destroyed”; legend shortens this probably
legendary answer to “Bum the libraries, for they are contained</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>in one book”— the Koran. According to Bar-Hebraeus, Amr distributed
the contents of the library among the city’s public baths, whose 4000
furnaces were fueled for six months with the papyrus and parchment rolls
(642). Against this story it should be noted that ( 1 ) a large part of
the library had been destroyed by Christian ardor under the Patriarch
Theophilus in 392;® (2) the remainder had suffered such hostility and
neglect that “most of the collection had disappeared by 642”; 4 and (3)
in the 500 years between the supposed event and its first reporter no
Christian historian mentions it, though one of them, Euty chius,
Archbishop of Alexandria in 933, described the Arab conquest of
Alexandria in great detail. 6 The story is now generally rejected as a
fable. In any case the gradual dissolution of the Alexandrian Library
was a tragedy of some moment, for it was believed to contain the
complete published works of Asschylus, Sophocles, Polybius, Livy,
Tacitus, and a hundred others, who have come down to us in mangled form;
full texts of the pre-Socratic philosophers, who survive only in
snatches; and thousands of volumes of Greek, Egyptian, and Roman
history, science, literature, and philosophy.</p>
<p>Amr administered Egypt competently. Part of the oppressive taxation
financed the repair of canals and dikes, and the reopening of an
eighty-mile canal between the Nile and the Red Sea; ships could now sail
from the Medi- terranean into the Indian Ocean. 6 (This canal was again
choked with sand in 723, and was abandoned.) Amr built a new capital on
the site where he had pitched his camp in 641; it was called al-Fustat,
apparently from the Arabic for tent; it was the first form of Cairo.
There for two centuries (66 1-</p>
<ol start="868" type="1">
<li>Moslem governors ruled Egypt for the caliphs of Damascus or
Baghdad.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every conquest creates a new frontier, which, being exposed to
danger, suggests further conquest. To protect Moslem Egypt from flank
attack by Byzantine Cyrene, an army of 40,000 Moslems advanced through
the desert to Barca, took it, and marched to the neighborhood of
Carthage. The Moslem general planted his spear in the sand some
eighty’miles south of the modern Tunis, built a camp, and so founded
(670) one of Islam’s major cities, Qairwan — “the resting place.”
Realizing that the capture of Carthage would give the Moslems control of
the Mediterranean and an open road to Spain, the Greek emperor sent
troops and a fleet; the Berbers, forgetting for a mo- ment their hatred
of Rome, joined in defending the city; and it was not till 698 that
Carthage was subdued. Soon thereafter Africa was conquered to the
Atlantic’s shores. The Berbers were persuaded, almost on their own
terms, to accept Moslem rule, and presently the Moslem faith. Africa was
divided into three provinces: Egypt with its capital at al-Fustat,
Ifriqiya with its cap- ital at Qairwan, Maghreb (Morocco) with its
capital at Fez.</p>
<p>For a century even these provinces acknowledged the Eastern caliphs
as their sovereigns. But the difficulties of communication and transport
were increased by the removal of the caliphate to Baghdad; and one by
one the</p>
<p>284 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>African provinces became independent kingdoms. An Idrisid dynasty
(789 —</p>
<ol start="974" type="1">
<li>ruled at Fez, an Aghlabid dynasty (800-909) at Qairwan, and a Tulu-
nid dynasty (869-905) in Egypt. That ancient granary, no longer robbed
of its product by foreign masters, entered upon a minor renaissance.
Ahmad ibn Tulun (869-84) conquered Syria for Egypt, built a new capital
at Qatai (a suburb of al-Fustat), promoted learning and art, raised
palaces, public baths, a hospital, and the great mosque that still
stands as his monument. His son Khumarawayh (884-95) transmuted this
energy into luxury, walled his palace with gold, and taxed his people to
provide himself with a pool of quicksilver on which his bed of inflated
leather cushions might gently float to win him sleep. Forty years after
his death the Tulunids were replaced by another Turkish dynasty, the
Ikshidid (935-69) . These African monarchies, having no roots in the
blood or traditions of the people, had to base their rule on military
force and leadership; and when wealth weakened their mar- tial ardor
their power melted away.</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest of the African dynasties reinforced its military
supremacy by associating itself with an almost fanatical religious
belief. About 905 Abu Abdallah appeared in Tunisia, preached the Ismaili
doctrine of the seven Imams, proclaimed the early coming of the Mahdi or
Savior, and won such a following among the Berbers that he was able to
overthrow the Aghlabid rule in Qairwan. To meet the expectations he had
aroused he summoned from Arabia Obeidallah ibn Muhammad, alleged
grandson of the Ismaili prophet Abdallah, hailed him as the Mahdi, made
him king (909), and was soon put to death by his king’s command.
Obeidallah claimed descent from Fatima, and gave her name to his
dynasty.</p>
<p>Under the Aghlabids and Fatimids North Africa renewed the prosperity
it had known in the heyday of Carthage and under imperial Rome. In the
youth of their vigor the Moslem conquerors in the ninth century opened
three routes, 1500 to 2000 miles long, across the Sahara to Lake Chad
and Timbuctu; northward and westward they established ports at Bone,
Oran, Ceuta, and Tangier; a fructifying commerce bound the Sudan with
the Mediterranean, and Eastern Islam with Morocco and Spain. Spanish
Moslem refugees brought to Morocco the art of leather; Fez flourished as
a center of exchange with Spain, and became famous for its dyes,
perfumes, and rimless cylindrical red hats.</p>
<p>In 969 the Fatimids wrested Egypt from the Ikshidids, and soon there-
after spread their rule over Arabia and Syria. The Fatimid Caliph Muizz
transferred his capital to Qahira (Cairo) : as Qatai had been a
northeastern extension of Fustat, so Qahira (“the victorious”) was a
northeastern pro - longation of Qatai, and, like its predecessors, began
as a military camp. Under Muizz (953-75) and his son Aziz (975-96), the
vizier Yaqub ibn Qillis, a Baghdad Jew converted to Islam, reorganized
the administration of Egypt, and made the Fatimids the richest rulers of
their time. When Muizz’ sister</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>Rashida died she left 2,700,000 dinars ( 2,825,000) , and 1 2,000
robes; when his sister Abda died she left 3,000 silver vases, 400 swords
damascened in gold, 30,000 pieces of Sicilian textiles, and a hoard of
jewelry. 7 But nothing fails like success. The next caliph, al-Hakim
(996-102 1 ) , went half mad with wealth and power. He arranged the
assassination of several viziers, perse- cuted Christians and Jews,
burned many diurches and synagogues, and or- dered the demolition of the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem; the execution of this order
was a contributory cause of the Crusades. .As if to repeat the career of
Caligula, he proclaimed himself a god, and sent mission- aries to
establish his cult among the people; when some of these preachers were
killed he took Christians and’ Jews back into favor, and rebuilt their
shrines. He was assassinated at the age of thirty-six.</p>
<p>Despite these royal prerogatives Egypt prospered as the commercial
link between Europe and Asia. Increasingly the merchants of India and
China sailed past the Persian Gulf and up the Red Sea and the Nile into
Egypt; the wealth and power of Baghdad declined, those of Cairo
grew.Nasir-i-Khosru, visiting the new capital in 1047, described it as
having 20,000 houses, mostly of brick, rising to five or six stories,
and 20,000 shops “so filled with gold, jewelry, embroideries, and satins
that there was no room to sit down.” 8 The main streets were protected
against the sun, and were lighted at night by lamps. Prices were fixed
by the government, and anyone caught charging more was paraded through
the city on a camel, ringing a bell and confessing his crime. 9
Millionaires were numerous; one merchant, a Christian, fed the whole
population at his own expense during five years of famine caused by the
low level of the Nile; and Yaqub ibn Qillis left an estate of some
o,ooo,ooo. 10 Such men joined with the Fatimid caliphs in building
mosques, libraries, and colleges, and fostering the sciences and the
arts. Despite occa- sional cruelties, wasteful luxuries, the usual
exploitation of labor, and the proper number of wars, the rule of the
Fatimids was in general beneficent and liberal, and could compare, in
prosperity and culture, with any age in Egyptian history. 11</p>
<p>The wealth of the Fatimids reached its peak in the long reign of
Mustansir (1036-94), the son of a Sudanese slave. He built for himself a
pleasure pavilion, and lived a life of music, wine, and ease; “this,” he
said, “is more pleasant than staring at the B lack Stone, listening to
the muezzin’s drone, and drinking impure water” (from Mecca’s holy well
of Zemzem) , 12 In 1 067 his Turkish troops rebelled, raided his palace,
and carried away, as loot, priceless treasures of art, great quantities
of jewelry, and twenty-five camel-loads of manuscripts; some of these
served the Turkish officers as fuel to heat their homes, while exquisite
leather bindings mended the shoes of their slaves. When Mustansir died
the Fatimid empire fell to pieces; its once powerful army broke into
quarreling factions of Berbers, Sudanese, and Turks; Ifri- qiya and
Morocco had already seceded, Palestine revolted, Syria was lost.</p>
<p>286 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>When, in 1 1 7 1 , Saladin dethroned the last F atimid caliph, one
more Egyptian dynasty had followed its predecessors through power and
pleasure to decay.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION IN AFRICA: 641-IO58</li>
</ol>
<p>The courts of Cairo, Qairwan, and Fez rivaled one another in the
support of architecture, painting, music, poetry, and philosophy. But
nearly all the surviving manuscripts of Islamic Africa in this period
are hidden in libraries which Western scholarship is just beginning to
explore; much of the art has perished, and only the mosques proclaim the
vigor and spirit of the age. At Qairwan stands the mosque of Sidi Oqba,
originally built in 670, seven times restored, and mostly dating from
838; its cloisters of round arches are upheld by hundreds of Corinthian
columns from the ruins of Carthage; its pulpit is a masterpiece of wood
carving, its mihrab a splendor of porphyry and faience; its square and
massive minaret — the oldest in the world 13 — set a Syrian style for
the minarets of the West. This mosque made Qairwan the fourth holy city
of Islam, one of “the four gates to Paradise.” Only less sacred and mag
- nificent were the mosques of Fez and Marraqesh, of Tunis and
Tripoli.</p>
<p>In Cairo the mosques were many and immense; 300 still adorn that
charm- ing capital. The mosque of Amr, begun in 642, was rebuilt in the
tenth century; nothing remains of its early constituents except the fine
Corinthian columns judiciously rescued from Roman and Byzantine ruins.
The mosque of Ibn Tulun (878) precariously preserves its first form and
ornament. A high crenellated wall surrounds its roomy court; within are
pointed arches older than any others in Egypt except tbe arch of the
Nilometer (865) — a structure built on an island in the Nile to measure
the rise of the river; possi- bly this graceful and convenient form of
the arch passed from Egypt through Sicily and the Normans to Gothic
Europe. 14 In the zigguratlike minaret, and in the domed tomb of Ibn
Tulun, are horseshoe arches — one of the less pleas- ing features of
Moslem art. It is told of Ibn Tulun that he had intended to raise the
arches on 300 columns; but when he learned that these could be secured
only by dismantling Roman or Christian edifices, he decided, instead, to
support the arches with massive piers of brick; 18 here again this
mosque may have suggested a characteristic element of the Gothic style.
Finally, as if to make the building a steppingstone to Chartres, some of
the windows were filled with colored glass, some with grilles of stone
in rosette or stellar or other geometrical designs; these, however, are
of uncertain date.</p>
<p>In 970-2 Jauhar, the converted Christian slave who had conquered
Egypt for theFatimids, built the mosque of el- Azhar (“the brilliant”) ;
some of the original structure is still in place; here too are pointed
arches, rising on 380 columns of marble, granite, or porphyry. The
mosque of al-Hakim (990-</p>
<ol start="1012" type="1">
<li>was built of stone, and most of it survives, though in disuse and
decay;</li>
</ol>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>some conception of its medieval splendor may be gathered from its
elegant stucco arabesques, and the fine Kufic inscription of the frieze.
Once these mosques, now as forbidding as fortresses (and doubtless so
designed) were glorified with exquisite carving and lettering, mosaic,
and tiled mihrabs, and chandeliers that have become museum rarities. The
mosque of Ibn Tulun had 1 8,000 lamps, many of varicolored enameled
glass. 16</p>
<p>The minor arts were practiced in Islamic Africa with Moslem patience
and finesse. Lustered tiles appear in the Qairwan mosque. Nasir-i-Khosru
( 1050) described Cairene pottery “so delicate and translucent that the
hand placed on the outside can be seen from within.” 17 Egyptian and
Syrian glass continued their ancient excellence. Fatimid rock-crystal
wares, preserved intact through a thousand years, are treasured in
Venice, Florence, and the Louvre. Wood carvers delighted the eye with
their work on mosque doors, pulpit panels, mihrabs, and window lattices.
From their Coptic subjects the Egyptian Moslems took the art of
decorating boxes, chests, tables, and other objects with inlay or
marquetry of wood, ivory, bone, or mother-of-pearl. Jewelry abounded.
When Turkish mercenaries raided the chambers of al-Mustansir they came
away with thousands of articles in gold — inkstands, chessmen, vases,
birds, artificial trees set with precious stones. . . . 18 Among the
spoils were curtains of silk brocade worked with gold thread, and
bearing the pictures and biographies of famous kings. From the Copts,
again, the Moslems learned to stamp and print patterns upon textiles
with wooden blocks; this technique was apparently carried from Islamic
Egypt to Europe by Crusaders, and may have shared in the development of
printing. European merchants rated Fatimid textiles above all others,
and told with awe of Cairene and Alexandrian fabrics so fine that a robe
could be drawn through a finger ring. 19 We hear of luxurious Fatimid
rugs, and of tents made of velvet, satin, damask, silk, and cloth of
gold, and decorated with paintings; a tent made for Yazuri, al-
Mustansir’s vizier, required the labor of 150 men over nine years, cost
30,000 dinars (42,500), and claimed to picture all the known animal
species of the world except homo lupus. All that remains of Fatimid
paintings is some fragmentary frescoes in the Arab Museum at Cairo. No
miniatures survive fromFatimidEgypt,but Maqrizi — who in the fifteenth
century wrote a history of painting — tells us that the library of the
Fatimid caliphs contained hundreds of richly illuminated manuscripts,
including 2400 Korans.</p>
<p>In the days of al-Hakim the caliphal library at Cairo had 100,000
volumes; in al- Mustansir’s time, 200,000. We are told that the
manuscripts were lent without charge to all responsible students. In 988
the vizier Yaqub ibn Qillis persuaded the Caliph Aziz to provide tuition
and maintenance for thirty-five students in the mosque of el-Azhar; thus
began the oldest existing university. As this madrasah developed it drew
pupils from all the Moslem world, as the University of Paris, a century
later, would draw them from all Europe.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Caliphs, viziers, and rich individuals added year by year to the
scholarships, until in our time el-Azhar has some 10,000 students and
300 professors. 20 One of the most pleasant sights of world travel is
the assemblage of students in the cloisters of this thousand-year-old
mosque, each group squatting in a semicircle at the base of a pillar
before a seated savant. Famous scholars from all Islam came here to
teach grammar, rhetoric, mathematics, poetry, logic, theology, Hadith,
Koranic exegesis, and law. The students paid no fees, the teachers
received no salaries. Dependent upon governmental subsidy and pri- vate
philanthropy, the famous university tended to ever more zealous ortho-
doxy, and its directing ulemas or learned men had a discouraging effect
upon Fatimid literature, philosophy, and science. We hear of no great
poets under this dynasty.</p>
<p>Al-Hakim set up in Cairo a Dar al-Hikma h (“Hall of Wisdom”) ; its
main function was to teach Ismaili Shi’ite theology; but its curriculum
included astronomy and medicine. Al-Hakim financed an observatory, and
helped Ali ibn Yunus (d. 1009), perhaps the greatest of Moslem
astronomers. After seventeen years of observations Yunus completed the
“Hakimite tables” of astral movements and periods, and gave more precise
values than before to the inclination of the ecliptic, the precession of
the equinoxes, and solar parallax.</p>
<p>The brightest name in Moslem Egyptian science is that of Muhammad ibn
al-Haitham, known to medieval Europe as Alhazen. Born at Basra in 965,
he won repute there as a mathematician and engineer. Hearing that
al-Haitham had a plan for regulating the annual inundation of the Nile,
al-Hakim invited him to Cairo. The plan proved impracticable, and
al-Haitham had to hide in obscurity from the incalculable Caliph.
Fascinated, like all medieval think- ers, by Aristotle’s attempt to
formulate a rational synthesis of knowledge, he composed several
commentaries on the works of the philosopher; none of these commentaries
has reached us. We know al-Haitham chiefly by his Kitab al-Manazir, or
Book of Optics-, of all medieval productions this is prob- ably the most
thoroughly scientific in its method and thought. Al-Haitham studied the
refraction of light through transparent mediums like air and water, and
came so close to discovering the magnifying lens that Roger Bacon,
Witelo, and other Europeans three centuries later based upon his work
their own advances toward the microscope and the telescope. He re-
jected the theory of Euclid and Ptolemy that vision results from a ray
leaving the eye and reaching the object; rather “the form of the
perceived object passes into the eye , and is transmitted there by the
transparent body”— the lens. 21 He remarked the effect of the atmosphere
in increasing the apparent size of sun or moon when near the horizon;
showed that through atmospheric refraction the light of the sun reaches
us even when the sun is as much as nineteen degrees below the horizon;
and on this basis he calculated the height of the atmosphere at ten
(English) miles. He analyzed the correlation</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>

<p>289</p>
<p>between the weight and the density of the atmosphere, and the effect
of atmospheric density upon the weight of objects. He studied with
complex mathematical formulas the action of light on spherical or
parabolic mirrors, and through the burning glass. He observed the
half-moon shape of the sun’s image, during eclipses, on the wall
opposite a small hole made in the window shutters; this is the first
known mention of the camera obscura, or dark cham- ber, on which all
photography depends. We could hardly exaggerate the influence of
al-Haitham on European science. Without him Roger Bacon might never have
been heard of; Bacon quotes him or refers to him at almost every step in
that part of the Opus maius which deals with optics; and Part VI rests
almost entirely on the findings of the Cairene physicist. As late as
Kepler and Leonardo European studies of light were based upon al-
Haitham’s work.</p>
<p>The most striking of all effects produced by the Arab conquest of
North Africa was the gradual but almost complete disappearance of
Christianity. The Berbers not only accepted Mohammedanism, they became
its most fa- natical defenders. Doubtless economic considerations
entered: non-Moslems paid a head tax, and converts were for a time freed
from it. When in 744 the Arab governor of Egypt offered this exemption,
24,000 Christians went over to Islam. 22 Occasional but severe
persecutions of Christians may have influ- enced many to conform to the
ruling faith. In Egypt a Coptic minority held out bravely, built their
churches like fortresses, maintained their worship in secret, and
survive to this day. But the once crowded churches of Alexandria,
Cyrene, Carthage, -and Hippo were emptied and decayed; the memory of
Athanasius, Cyril, and Augustine faded out; and the disputes of Arians,
Donatists, and Monophysites gave way to the quarrels of Sunni and
Ismaili Mohammedanism. The Fatimids propped up their power by gathering
the Ismailites into a Grand Lodge of complex initiations and
hierarchical degrees; the members were used for political espionage and
intrigue; the forms of the order were transmitted to Jerusalem and
Europe, and strongly influenced the organization, ritual, and garb of
the Templars, the Illuminati, and the other secret fraternities of the
Western world. The American businessman is peri- odically a zealous
Mohammedan, proud of his secret doctrine, his Moroccan fez, and his
Moslem shrine.</p>

<p>Having conquered Syria and Egypt, the Moslem leaders realized that
they could not hold the coast without a fleet. Soon their men-of-war
seized Cyprus and Rhodes, and defeated the Byzantine navy (652, 655).
Corsica was occupied in 809, Sardinia in 810, Crete in 823, Malta in
870. In 827 the old struggle between Greece and Carthage for Sicily was
resumed; the Aghlabid caliphs of Qairwan sent expedition after
expedition, and the con- quest proceeded with leisurely bloodshed and
rapine. Palermo fell in 831,</p>

<p>Messina in 843, Syracuse in 878, Taormina in 902. When the Fatimid
caliphs succeeded to the Aghlabid power (909) they inherited Sicily as
part of their domain. When the Fatimids removed their seat to Cairo
their governor of Sicily, Husein al-Kalbi, made himself emir with nearly
sovereign authority, and established that Kalbite dynasty under which
Moslem civilization in Sicily reached its height.</p>
<p>Fortified by mastery of the Mediterranean, the Saracens now looked
appreciatively on the cities of southern Italy. As piracy was quite
within the bounds of honored custom at this time, and Christians and
Moslems raided Moslem or Christian shores to capture infidels for sale
as slaves, Saracen fleets, mostly from Tunisia or Sicily, began in the
ninth century to attack Italian ports. In 841 the Moslems took Bari, the
main Byzantine base in southeastern Italy. A year later, invited by the
Lombard Duke of Benevento to help him against Salerno, they swept across
Italy and back, despoiling fields and monasteries as they went. In 846
eleven hundred Moslems landed at Ostia, marched up to the walls of Rome,
freely plundered the suburbs and the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul,
and leisurely returned to their ships. See- ing that no civil authority
could organize Italian defense, Pope Leo IV took charge, bound Amalfi,
Naples, Gaeta, and Rome in alliance, and had a chain stretched across
the Tiber to halt any enemy. In 849 the Saracens made an- other attempt
to seize the citadel of Western Christianity. The united Italian fleet,
blessed by the Pope, gave them battle, and routed them — a scene pic-
tured by Raphael in the Stanze of the Vatican. In 866 the Emperor Louis
II came down from Germany, and drove the marauding Moslems of south
Italy back upon Bari and Taranto. By 884 they were expelled from the
peninsula. But their raids continued, and central Italy lived through a
generation of daily fear. In 876 they pillaged the Campagna; Rome was so
endangered that the pope paid the Saracens a yearly bribe of 25,000
mancusi (c. 5,000) to keep the peace. 23 In 884 they burned the great
monastery of Monte Cas- sino to the ground; in sporadic attacks they
ravaged the valley of the Anio; finally the combined forces of the pope,
the Greek and German emperors, and the cities of southern and central
Italy defeated them on the Garigliano (916), and a tragic century of
invasion came to an end. Italy, perhaps Chris- tianity, had had a narrow
escape; had Rome fallen, the Saracens would have advanced upon Venice;
and Venice taken, Constantinople would have been wedged in between two
concentrations of Moslem power. On such chances of battle hung the
theology of billions of men.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the polyglot culture of Sicily, yielding with the grace of
habit to new conquerors, took on a Moslem veneer. Sicilians, Greeks,
Lombards, Jews, Berbers, and Arabs mingled in the streets of the Moslem
capital- ancient Panormus, Arabic Balerm, Italian Palermo; all hating
one another religiously, but living together with no more than a
Sicilian average of passion, poetry, and crime. Here Ibn Hawqal, about
970, found some 300</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>mosques, and 300 schoolteachers who were highly regarded by the
inhab- itants “in spite of the fact,” says the geographer, “that
schoolteachers are notorious for their mental deficiency and light
brains.” 24 With sunshine and rain co-operating to make a lush
Vegetation, Sicily was an agricultural para- dise; and the clever Arabs
reaped the fruits of a well-managed economy. Palermo became a port of
exchange between Christian Europe and Moslem Africa; soon it was one of
the richest cities in Islam. The Moslem flair for fine dress, brilliant
jewelry, and the arts of decoration made for a life of otium cum
dignitate — leisure without vulgarity. The Sicilian poet Ibn Ham- dis (
c . 1055-1 132) describes the vivacious hours of Palermitan youth: the
midnight revels, the jolly raid on a convent to buy wine from a
surprised but genial nun, the gay mingling of men and women in festival,
“when the King of the Revels has outlawed care,” and singing girls tease
the lute with slender fingers, and dance “like resplendent moons on the
stems of willowy trees.” 25</p>
<p>There were thousands of poets in the island, for the Moors loved wit
and rhyme, and Sicilian love offered rich themes. There were scholars,
for Palermo boasted a university; and great physicians, for Sicilian
Moslem med- icine influenced the medical school at Salerno. 26 Half the
brilliance of Nor- man Sicily was an Arab echo, an Oriental legacy of
crafts and craftsmen to a young culture willing to learn from any race
or creed. The Norman con- quest of Sicily (1060-91) helped time to
efface the vestiges of Islam in the island; Count Roger was proud that
he had leveled “Saracen cities, castle s, and palaces built with
marvelous art.” 27 But Moslem style left its mark on the Palace of La
Ziza, and on the ceiling of the Capella Palatina; in this chapel of the
palace of the Norman kings Moorish ornament serves the shrine of
Christ.</p>

<p>It was at first the Moors, not the Arabs, who conquered Spain. Tariq
was a Berber, and his army had 7000 Berbers to 300 Arabs. His name is
embedded in the rock at whose foot his forces landed; the Moors came to
call it Gebel al-Tariq, the Mountain of Tariq, which Europe compressed
into Gibraltar. Tariq had been sent to Spain by Musa ibn Nusayr, Arab
governor of North Africa. In 712 Musa crossed with 10,000 Arabs and 8000
Moors; besieged and captured Seville and Merida; rebuked Tariq for
exceeding orders, struck him with a whip, and cast him into prison. The
Caliph Walid recalled Musa and freed Tariq, who resumed his conquests.
Musa had appointed his son Abd al- Aziz governor of Seville; Suleiman,
Walid’s br other, suspected Abd al-Aziz of plotting to make himself
independent sovereign of Spain, and des-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>(chap, xni</p>
<p>patched assassins to kill him. The head was brought to Suleiman, now
caliph, at Damascus; he sent for Musa, who asked: “Grant me his head,
that I may close his eyes.” Within a year Musa died of grief. 28 We may
believe that the story is only a bloody legend.</p>
<p>The victors treated the conquered leniently, confiscated the lands
only of those who had actively resisted, exacted no greater tax than had
been levied by the Visigothic kings, and gave to religious worship a
freedom rare in Spain. Having established their position in the
peninsula, the Moslems scaled the Pyrenees and entered Gaul, intent upon
making Europe a province of Damascus. Between Tours and Poitiers, a
thousand miles north of Gibral- tar, they were met by the united forces
of Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine, and Charles, Duke of Austrasia. After seven
days of fighting, the Moslems were defeated in one of the most crucial
battles of history (732); again the faith of countless millions was
determined by the chances of war. Thenceforth Charles was Carolus
Martellus, or Martel, Charles the Hammer. In 735 the Moslems tried
again, and captured Arles; in 737 they took Avignon, and ravaged the
valley of the Rhone to Lyons. In 759 Pepin the Short finally expelled
them from the south of France; but their forty years of circulation
there may have influenced Languedoc’s unusual tolerance of diverse
faiths, its colorful gaiety, its flair for songs of unpermitted
love.</p>
<p>The caliphs of Damascus undervalued Spain; till 756 it was merely
“the district of Andalusia,” and was governed from Qairwan. But in 755 a
ro - mantic figure landed in Spain, armed only with royal blood, and
destined to establish a dynasty that would rival in wealth and glory the
caliphs of Baghdad. When, in 750, the triumphant Abbasids ordered all
princes of the Umayyad family slain, Abd-er-Rahman, grandson of the
Caliph Hisham, was the only Umayyad who escaped. Hunted from village to
village, he swam the broad Euphrates, crossed into Palestine, Egypt and
Africa, and finally reached Morocco. News of the Abbasid revolution had
intensified the factional rivalry of Arabs, Syrians, Persians, and Moors
in Spain; an Arab group loyal to the Umayyads, fearing that the Abbasid
caliph might question their titles to lands given them by Umayyad
governors, invited Abd-er- Rahman to join and lead them. He came, and
was made emir of Cordova (756). He defeated an army commissioned by the
Caliph al-Mansur to un- seat him, and sent the head of its general to be
hung before a palace in Mecca.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was these events that saved Europe from worshiping Moham-
med: Moslem Spain, weakened with civil war and deprived of external aid,
ceased to conquer, and withdrew even from northern Spain. From the ninth
to the eleventh century the peninsula was divided into Moslem and
Christian by a line running from Coimbra through Saragossa and along the
Ebro River. The Moslem south, finally pacified by Abd-er-Rahman I and
his successors, blossomed into riches, poetry, and art. Abd-er-Rahman II
(822-52) enjoyed the fruits of this prosperity. Amid border wars with
the Christians, rebellions</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII) WESTERN ISLAM 293</p>
<p>among his subjects, and Norman raids on his coasts, he found time to
beau- tify Cordova with palaces and mosques, rewarded poets handsomely,
and forgave offenders with an amiable lenience that may have shared in
produc- ing the social disorder that followed his reign.</p>
<p>Abd-er-Rahman III (912-61) is the culminating figure of this Umayyad
dynasty in Spain. Coming to power at twenty- one, he found “Andaluz”
torn by racial faction, religious animosity, sporadic brigandage, and
the efforts of Seville and Toledo to establish their independence of
Cordova. Though a man of refinement, famous for generosity and courtesy,
he laid a firm hand upon the situation, quelled the rebellious cities,
and subdued the Arab aristo- crats who wished, like their French
contemporaries, to enjoy a feudal sover- eignty on their rich estates.
He invited to his councils men of diverse faiths, adjusted his alliances
to maintain a balance of power among his neighbors and his enemies, and
administered the government with Napoleonic industry and attention to
detail. He planned the campaigns of his generals, often took the field
in person, repulsed the invasions of Sancho of Navarre, captured and
destroyed Sancho’s capital, and discouraged further Christian foray s
during his reign. In 929, knowing himself as powerful as any ruler of
his time, and realizing that the caliph of Baghdad had become a puppet
of Turkish guards, he assumed the caliphal title — Commander of the
Faithful and Defender of the Faith. When he died he left behind him, in
his own handwriting, a mod- est estimate of human life:</p>
<p>I have now reigned above fifty 〔Mohammedan〕 years in victory or</p>
<p>peace. . . . Riches and honors, powers and pleasures, have waited on
my call; nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my
felicity. In this situation I have diligently numbered the days of</p>
<p>pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot. They amount
to fourteen. O man! place not thy confidence in this present world!
29</p>
<p>His son Hakam II (961-76) profited wisely from this half century of
un- happy competence. Secure from external danger and internal revolt,
he gave himself to the adornment of Cordova and other cities; built
mosques, col- leges, hospitals, markets, public baths, and asylums for
the poor; 30 made the University of Cordova the greatest educational
institution of his time; and helped hundreds of poets, artists, and
savants. The Moslem historian al- Maqqari writes:</p>
<p>The Caliph Hakam surpassed every one of his predecessors in love</p>
<p>of literature and the sciences, which he himself cultivated and
fos-</p>
<p>tered … he converted Andaluz into a great market whereto the liter-
ary productions of every clime were immediately brought for sale.</p>
<p>He employed agents to collect books for him in distant countries, and
remitted to them large sums of money, until the number of books thus
conveyed to Andaluz exceeded all calculation. He would likewise</p>
<p>send gifts of money to celebrated authors in the East, to encourage
the</p>
<p>294 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>publication of works, or to obtain the first copies of them. In this
way, knowing that Abu’l Faraj of Isfahan had written a work entitled</p>
<p>Kitab ul-Aghani, he sent him 1000 dinars of pure gold (750), upon
which the author forwarded him a copy of this work, even before it</p>
<p>had appeared in Iraq. 31</p>
<p>While the scholar-caliph attended to the amenities of life, he left
the ad- ministration of the government, even the guidance of national
policy, to his able Jewish prime minister Hasdai ibn Shaprut, and the
leadership of his armies to a brilliant and unscrupulous general who,
under the name of Al- manzor, was to provide material for many a
Christian drama or romance. His real name was Muhammad ibn Abi Amir. He
came of an old Arab family with more genealogy than means; he earned a
living by writing petitions for persons who wished to address the
caliph; became a clerk in the office of the chief qadi or attorney
general; and in 967, at the age of twenty-six, was ap- pointed to manage
the property of al- Hakam’s eldest son, another Abd -er- Rahman. He
ingratiated himself with the lad’s mother, Queen Subh,</p>
<p>charmed her with courtesies and compliments, and impressed her with
his tireless ability; soon he was managing her property as well as her
son’s; and within a year he was named master of the mint. He now became
so generous to his friends that rivals accused him of malversation.
Al-Hakam summoned him to clear his account; knowing that he could not,
Ibn Abi Amir asked a rich friend to advance him the deficit; so armed,
he went to the palace, faced his accusers, and carried the matter off so
triumphantly that the Caliph ap- pointed him concurrently to several
lucrative posts. When Hakam died, ibn Abi Amir secured t he succession
to Hakam’s son Hisham II (976 -1009; —</p>
<p>1 01 0-13) by personally directing the murder of a rival claimant. A
week later he was made vizier. 32</p>
<p>Hisham II was a weakling, altogether incapable of rule; from 978 to
1002 Ibn Ali was caliph in all but name. His enemies charged him, quite
rightly, with loving philosophy more than the Moslem faith; to silence
them he in- vited the orthodox theologians to weed out from al- Hakam’s
great library, and burn, all volumes that in any way impugned the Sunni
creed; and by this act of dastardly vandalism he earned a useful
reputation for piety. At the same time he drew the intellectual classes
to his support by secretly protect- ing the philosophers, welcoming men
of letters at his court, and housing there a bevy of poets who drew
stipends from the treasury, followed his cam- paigns, -and sang his
victories. He built a new town, Zahira, cast of Cordova, for his palace
and administrative offices, while the young Caliph, carefully trained to
absorption in theology, remained almost a neglected prisoner in the
ancient royal residence. To consolidate his position, Ibn Abi Amir re-
organized the army mainly with Berber and Christian mercenaries, who,
hos- tile to the Arabs, felt no obligations to the state, but rewarded
with personal loyalty his liberality and tact. When the Christian state
of Leon aided a do-</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>mestic rebellion against him, he destroyed the rebels, severely
defeated the Leonese, and returned in triumph to his capital; thereafter
he assumed the surname of al- Mansur, “the victorious.” Plots against
him were numerous, but he circumvented them with pervasive espionage and
judicious assassina- tion. His son Abdallah joined one of the
conspiracies, was detected, and was beheaded. Like Sulla, al-Mansur
never left a favor unrewarded, nor an injury unavenged.</p>
<p>The people forgave his crimes because he effectively suppressed other
criminals, and secured an impartial provision of justice for rich and
poor; never had life or property been so safe in Cordova. Men could not
help ad- mire his persistence, intelligence, and courage. One day, while
holding court, he felt a pain in his leg; he sent for a physician, who
advised cautery; with no interruption to the session, al-Mansur allowed
his flesh to be burned without giving any sign of discomfort; “the
assembly,” says al - Maqqari, “perceived nothing until they smelled the
burnt flesh.” 33 As a further aid to popularity, he enlarged the mosque
of Cordova with the labor of Christian captives, and himself wielded
pick and shovel, trowel and saw. Having learned that states- men who
organize successful wars, just or unjust, are exalted by both con-
temporaries and posterity, he renewed the war with Leon, captured and
razed its capital, and massacred the population. Nearly every spring he
sallied forth on a new campaign against the infidel north, and never
returned with- out victory. In 997 he took and destroyed the city of
Santiago de Compostela, leveled to the ground its famous shrine to
St. James, and made Christian cap- tives carry the gates and bells of
the church on their shoulders in his tri- umphal entry into Cordova. 34
(In later years the bells would be returned to Compostela on the backs
of Moslem prisoners of war.)</p>
<p>Though sovereign in fact of Moslem Spain, al-Mansur was not content;
he longed to be sovereign in name, and to found a dynasty. In 99 1 he
resigned his office to his eighteen-year-old son Abd-al-Malik, added the
names say id (lord) and malik karivi (noble king) to his other titles,
and ruled with abso-</p>
<p>lute power. He had wished to die on the battlefield, and, prepared
for this consummation, he took his burial shroud with him on his
campaigns. In 1002, aged 61, he invaded Castile, captured cities,
destroyed monasteries, ravaged fields. On the homeward march he fell
ill; refusing medical attend- ance, he called for his son, and told him
that death would come within two days. When Abd-al-Malik wept al- Mansur
said: “This is a sign that the Em- pire will soon decay.” 35 A
generation later the Cordovan caliphate collapsed. The history of
Moorish Spain after al-Mansur is a chaos of brief reigns,
assassinations, racial strife, and class war. The Berbers, scorned and
impov- erished in the realm that their arms had won, and relegated to
the arid plains of Estremadura or the cold mountains of Leon,
periodically revolted against the ruling Arab aristocracy. The exploited
workers of the towns hated their employers, and changed them
spasmodically with murderous insurrection.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>All classes united in one hatred — of that Amirid family, the heirs
of al- Mansur, which, under his son, almost monopolized the offices of
government and the perquisites of power. In 1008 Abd-al-Malik died, and
was suc- ceeded as prime minister by his brother Abd-er-Rahman Shandjul.
Shandjul drank wine in public, and had a kind word for sin; he preferred
to carouse rather than to govern; in 1009 he was deposed by a revolution
in which nearly all factions joined. The revolutionary masses got out of
hand, plun- dered the Amirid palaces at Zahira, and burned them to the
ground. In 1012 the Berbers captured and pillaged Cordova, slew half the
population, exiled the rest, and made Cordova a Berber capital. So
briefly does a Christian his- torian recount the French Revolution of
Islamic Spain.</p>
<p>But the ardor that destroys is seldom mated with the patience that
builds. Under Berber rule disorder, brigandage, and unemployment
mounted; cities subject to Cordova seceded and withheld tribute, and
even the owners of great estates made themselves sovereign on their
lands. Gradually the surviv- ing Cordovans recovered; in 1 02 3 they
expelled the Berbers from the capital, and gave the throne to
Abd-er-Rahman V. Seeing no advantage in a return to the old regime, the
proletariat of Cordova captured the royal palace, and pro- claimed one
of their leaders, Muhammad al-Mustakfi, as caliph (1023). Muhammad
appointed a weaver as his prime minister. The weaver was as- sassinated,
the proletarian Caliph was poisoned, and in 1027 a union of upper and
middle classes elevated Hisham III. Four years later the army took its
turn, killed Hisham’s prime minister, and demanded Hisham’s abdication.
A council of leading citizens, perceiving that competition for the
throne was making government impossible, abolished the Spanish
caliphate, and replaced it with a council of state. Ibn Jahwar was
chosen first consul, and ruled the new republic with justice and
wisdom.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The political authority and cultural leadership
had been irrevocably destroyed. Scholarship and poetry, frightened by
civil war, had fled from the “Gem of the World” to the courts of Toledo,
Gra nada, and Seville. Moslem Spain disintegrated into twenty-three
taifas or city-states, too busy with intrigue and strife to stop the
gradual absorption of Moham- medan by Christian Spain. Granada’
prospered under the able ministry (1038-73) of Rabbi Samuel Halevi,
known to the Arabs as Ismail ibn Nagh- dela. Toledo declared its
independence of Cordova in 1035, and fifty years later submitted to
Christian rule.</p>
<p>Seville succeeded to the glory of Cordova. Some thought it fairer
than that capital; people loved it for its gardens, palm trees, and
roses, and a gaiety always ready with music, dance, and song.
Anticipating the fall of Cordova, it made itself indepedent in 1023. Its
chief justice, Abu’l Qasim Muhammad, found a mat-maker resembling Hisham
II, hailed him as Caliph, housed and guided him, and persuaded Valencia,
Tortosa, even Cordova, to recognize him; by this simple device the
subtle jurist founded the brief Abbadid dy-</p>

<p>nasty. When he died ( 1042) , his son Abbad al-Mutadid succeeded him,
ruled Seville with skill and cruelty for twenty-seven years, and
extended his power till half of Moslem Spain paid him tribute. His son
al-Mutamid (1068-91), at the age of twenty-six, inherited his realm, but
neither his ambition nor his cruelty. Al-Mutamid was the greatest poet
of Moslem Spain. He preferred the company of poets and musicians to that
of politicians and generals, and rewarded his able rivals in poetry with
unenvious hand; he thought it not too much to give a thousand ducats
(,290) for an epigram. 36 He liked Ibn Am- mar’s poetry, and made him
vizier. Fie heard a girl slave, Rumaykiyya, im - provise excellent
verses; he bought her, married her, and loved her passion- ately till
his death, while not neglecting the other beauties of his harem.
Rumaykiyya filled the palace with her laughter, and drew her lord into a
spiral of gaiety; theologians blamed her for her husband’s coolness to
religion, and the near emptiness of the city’s mosques. Nevertheless
al-Mutamid could rule as well as love and sing. When Toledo attacked
Cordova, and Cordova asked his aid, he sent troops who saved the city
from Toledo and made it sub- ject to Seville. The poet-king stood for a
precarious generation at the head of a civilization as brilliant as
Baghdad’s under Harun, as Cordova’s under al-Mansur.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Civilization in Moorish Spain</li>
</ol>
<p>“Never was Andalusia so mildly, justly, and wisely governed as by her
Arab conquerors.” 37 It is the judgment of a great Ch ristian
Orientalist, whose en- thusiasm may require some discounting of his
praise; but after due deductions his verdict stands. The emirs and
caliphs of Spain were as cruel as Machiavelli thought necessary to the
stability of a government; sometimes they were bar- barously and
callously cruel, as when Mutadid grew flowers in the skulls of his dead
foes, or as when the poetic Mutamid hacked to pieces the lifelong friend
who had at last betrayed and insulted him. 38 Against these stray in-
stances al-Maqqari gives a hundred examples of the justice, liberality,
and refinement of the Umayyad rulers of Spain. 39 They compare favorably
with the Greek emperors of their time; and they were certainly an
improvement upon the illiberal Visigothic regime that had preceded them.
Their manage- ment of public affairs was the most competent in the
Western world of that age. Laws were rational and humane, and were
administered by a well- organized judiciary. For the most part the
conquered, in their internal affairs, were governed by their own laws
and their own officials. 40 Towns were well policed; markets, weights
and measures were effectively supervised. A regular census recorded
population and property. Taxation was reasonable compared with the
imposts of Rome or Byzantium. The revenues of the Cordovan caliphate
under Abd-er-Rahman III reached 12,045,000 gold dinars (7,213,750) —
probably more than the united governmental reve-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>nues of Latin Christendom; 41 but these receipts were due not so much
to high taxes as to well-governed and progressive agriculture, industry,
and trade. 42</p>
<p>The Arab conquest was a transient boon to the native peasantry. The
over- grown estates of the Visigothic nobles were broken up, and the
serfs became proprietors. 43 But the forces that in these centuries were
making for feudal- ism operated in Spain too, though better resisted
than in France; the Arab leaders in their turn accumulated large tracts,
and farmed them with tenants verging on serfdom. Slaves were slightly
better treated by the Moors * than by their former owners; 44 and the
slaves of non-Moslems could free them- selves merely by professing
Islam. The Arabs for the most part left the actual work of agriculture
to the conquered; however, they used the latest manuals of agronomy, and
under their direction agricultural science developed in Spain far in
advance of Christian Europe. 45 The leisurely oxen, hitherto uni-
versally used in Spain for plowing or draft, were largely replaced by
the mule, the ass, and the horse. Stock breeding of Spanish with Arab
strains pro- duced the “noble steed” of the Arab horseman and the
Spanish Caballero. Moslem Spain brought from Asia, and taught to
Christian Europe, the cul- ture of rice, buckwheat, sugar cane,
pomegranates, cotton, spinach, aspara- gus, silk, bananas, cherries,
oranges, lemons, quinces, grapefruit, peaches, dates, figs,
strawberries, ginger, myrrh. 46 The cultivation of the vine was a major
industry among the Moors, whose religion forbade wine. Market gar- dens,
olive groves, and fruit orchards made some areas of Spain — notably
around Cordova, Granada, and Valencia — “garden spots of the world.” The
island of Majorca, won by the Moors in the eighth century, became under
their husbandry a paradise of fruits and flowers, dominated by the date
palm that later gave its name to the capital.</p>
<p>The mines of Spain enriched the Moors with gold, silver, tin, copper,
iron, lq^d, alum, sulphur, mercury. Coral wa s gathered along
Andalusia’s shores; pearls were fished along the Catalonian coasts;
rubies were mined at Baja and Malaga. Metallurgy was well developed;
Murcia was famous for its iron and brass works, Toledo for its swords,
Cordova for shields. Handicraft industry flourished. Cordova made
“Cordovan” leather for the “cordwainers” (cor - dobanes ) of Europe.
There were 1 3,000 weavers in Cordova alone; Moorish carpets, cushions,
silk curtains, shawls, divans found eager buyers every- where. According
to al-Maqqari, 48 Ibn Firnas of Cordova, in the ninth cen- tury,
invented spectacles, complex chronometers, and a flying machine. A
merchant fleet of over a thousand ships carried the products of Spain to
Africa and Asia; and vessels from a hundred ports crowded the harbors of
Barcelona, Almeria, Cartagena, Valencia, Malaga, Cadiz, and Seville. A

<p>lar postal service was maintained for the government. The official
coinage of gold dinars, silver dirhems, and copper fals preserved a
relative stability in comparison with the currencies of contemporary
Latin Christendom; but these Moorish coins, too, gradually deteriorated
in weight, purity, and pur- chasing power.</p>
<p>Economic exploitation proceeded here as elsewhere. Arabs who had ex-
tensive estates, and merchants who squeezed producer and consumer alike,
absorbed the wealth of the land. For the most part the rich lived in
country villas, and left the cities to a proletarian population of
Berbers, “Renegades” (Christian converts to Mohammedanism), “Mozarabs”
(non -Moslems ac- cepting Moslem ways and Arabic speech), and a
sprinkling of palace eu- nuchs, Slav officers and guardsmen, and
household slaves. The Cordovan caliphs, feeling themselves unable to end
exploitation without discouraging enterprise, compromised by devoting a
quarter of their land income to the relief of the poor. 49</p>
<p>The desperate faith of the indigent gave a subtle power to the faqihs
or theologians of the law. Innovations in creed or morals were so
abhorred by the populace that heresy and speculation usually hid their
heads in obscurity of place or speech; philosophy was silenced, or
professed the most respectable conclusions. Apostasy from Islam was
punishable with death. Cordovan caliphs themselves were often men of
liberal views, but they suspected the Egyptian Fatimid caliphs of using
wandering scholars as spies, and occa- sionally they joined the faqihs
in persecuting independent thought. On the other hand the Moorish
authorities gave freedom of worship to all non- Moslem faiths. The Jews,
harshly hounded by the Visigoths, had helped the Moslem conquest of
Spain; they lived now — until the twelfth century — in peace with the
conquerors, developed wealth and learning, and sometimes rose to high
place in the government. Christians faced greater obstacles to political
preferment, but many succeeded nevertheless. Christian males, like all
males, were subject to compulsory circumcision as a measure of national
hygiene; otherwise they were ruled by their own Visigothic-Roman law,
administered by magistrates of their own choosing. 50 In return for
exemption from military service, free and able Christian males paid a
land tax, normally forty-eight dirhems (4.00) per year for the rich,
twenty-four for the mid- dle classes, twelve for manual workers. 51
Christians and Moslems intermar- ried freely; now and then they joined
in celebrating a Christian or Moslem holyday, or used the same building
as church and mosque. 52 Some Christians, conforming to the custom of
the country, established harems, or practiced pederasty. 53 Clerics and
laymen from Christian Europe came in safety and freedom to Cordova,
Toledo, or Seville as students, visitors, or travelers. One Christian
complained of the results in terms that recall ancient Hebrew criti-
cism of Hellenizing Jews:</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>My fellow Christians delight in the poems and romances of the</p>
<p>Arabs; they study the works of Mohammedan theologians and phi-</p>
<p>losophers, not to refute them, but to acquire a correct and
elegant</p>
<p>Arabic style Alas! the young Christians who are most conspicuous</p>
<p>for their talent have no knowledge of any literature or language save
the Arabic; they read and study with avidity Arabic books; they</p>
<p>amass whole libraries of them at great cost; they everywhere sing the
praises of Arabic lore. 54</p>
<p>We may judge the attractiveness of Islam to Christians from a letter
of 1 3 1 1, which gives the Mohammedan population of Granada at that
time as 200,- 000, of whom all but 500 were descendants of Christians
converted to Islam. 55 Christians frequently expressed their preference
of Moslem to Christian rule. 56</p>
<p>But there was another side to the picture, and it darkened with time.
Though Christians were free, the Church was not. Most of her landed
prop- erty had been confiscated by a decree affecting all active
resisters to the con- quest; many churches had been destroyed, and new
ones were prohibited. 57 The Moslem emirs inherited from the Visigoth
kings the right to appoint and depose bishops, even to summon
ecclesiastical councils. The emirs sold bish- oprics to the highest
bidder, though he might be a skeptic or a libertine. Christian priests
were liable to abuse by Moslems in the streets. Moslem theo- logians
commented freely on what seemed to them absurdities in Christian
theology, but it was dangerous for Christians to reply in kind.</p>
<p>Under such tense relations a minor incident could lead to a major
tragedy. A pretty girl of Cordova, known to us only as Flora, was the
child of a mixed marriage. When her Mohammedan father died she resolved
to become a Christian. She fled from her brother’s guardianship to a
Christian home, was caught and beaten by him, persisted in apostasy, and
was turned over to a Moslem court. The qadi, who might have condemned
her to death, ordered her flogged. She escaped again to a Christian
home, and there met a young priest, Eulogius, who conceived for her a
passionate spiritual attachment. While she hid in a convent another
priest, Perfectus, achieved martyrdom by telling some Moslems what he
thought of Mohammed; they had promised not to betray him, but the vigor
of his exposition so shocked them that they denounced him to the
authorities. Perfectus might have saved himself by a retraction; instead
he repeated to the judge his conviction that Mohammed was “the servant
of Satan.” The judge remanded him to jail for some months, hoping for a
change of mood; none came; and Perfectus was condemned to death. He
marched to the scaffold cursing the Prophet as “an impostor, an
adulterer, a child of hell.” The Moslems glo ated over his decapitation,
the Christians of Cordova buried him with pomp as a saint (850) . 58</p>
<p>His death inflamed the theological hatred of both sides. A group of
Chris- tian “Zealots” formed, led by Eulogius; they were determined to
denounce</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>Mohammed publicly, and to accept martyrdom joyfully as a promise of
para- dise. Isaac, a Cordovan monk, went to the qadi and professed a
desire for con- version; but when the judge, well pleased, began to
expound Mohammedan- ism, the monk interrupted him: “Your Prophet,” he
said, “has lied and deceived you. May he be accursed, who has dragged so
many wretches with him down to hell! The qadi reproved him, and asked
had he been drinking; the monk replied: “I am in my r ight mind.
Condemn- me to death.” The qadi had him imprisoned, but asked permission
of Abd-er-Rahman II to dismiss him as insane; the Caliph, incensed by
the splendor of Perfectus’ funeral, or - dered the monk to be executed.
Two days later Sancho, a Frank soldier of the palace guard, publicly
denounced Mohammed; he was beheaded. On the following Sunday six monks
appeared before the qadi, cursed Mohammed, and asked for not death only,
but “your sharpest tortures”; they were be - headed. A priest, a deacon,
and a monk followed their example. The Zealots rejoiced, but many
Christians — priests as well as laymen — condemned this lust for
martyrdom. “The Sultan,” they said to the Zealots, “allows us to ex -
ercise our religion, and does not oppress us; why, then, this fanatical
zeal?” 59 A council of Christian bishops, summoned by Abd-er-Rahman,
reproved the Zealots, and threatened action against them if they
continued the agitation. Eulogius denounced the council as cowards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Flora, her ardor raised by the Zealot movement, left her
con- vent, and with another girl, Mary, went before the qadi ; they both
assured him that Mohammed was “an adulterer, an impostor, and a
villain,” and that Mohammedanism was “an invention of the Devil.” The
qadi co mmitted them to jail. The entreaties of their friends had
inclined them to retract when Eulogius prevailed upon them to accept
martyrdom. They were beheaded (851), and Eulogius, much encouraged,
called for new martyrs. Priests, monks, and women marched to the court,
denounced Mohammed, and ob- tained decapitation (852). Eulogius himself
earned martyrdom seven years later. After his death the movement
subsided. We hear of two cases of mar- tyrdom between 859 and 983, and
none thereafter under Moslem rule in Spain. 60</p>
<p>Among the Moslems religious ardor declined as wealth grew. Despite
the rigor of Moslem law, a wave of skepticism rose in the eleventh
century. Not only did the mild heresies of the Mutazilites finally enter
Spain; a sect arose that declared all religions false, and laughed at
commandments, prayer, fast- ing, pilgrimage, and alms. Another group,
under the name of “Universal Re - ligion,” deprecated all dogmas, and
pled for a purely ethical religion. Some were agnostics: the doctrines
of religion, they said, “may or may not be true; we neither affirm nor
deny them, we simply cannot tell; but our consciences will not allow us
to accept doctrines whose truth cannot be demonstrated.” 01 The
theologians fought back with vigor; when disaster came to Spanish Islam
in the eleventh century they pointed to irreligion as its cause; and
when for a</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>time Islam prospered again, it was under rulers who once more rooted
their power in religious belief, and restricted the controversy between
religion and philosophy to the privacy and amusement of their
courts.</p>
<p>Despite the philosophers, gleaming cupolas and gilded minarets marked
the thousand cities or towns that made Moslem Spain in the tenth century
the most urban country in Europe, probably in the world. Cordova under
al- Mansur was a civilized city, second only to Baghdad and
Constantinople. Here, says al-Maqqari, were 200,077 houses, 60,300
palaces, 600 mosques, and 700 public baths; 62 the statistics are
slightly Oriental. Visitors marveled at the wealth of the upper classes,
and at what seemed to them an extraordi- nary general prosperity; every
family could afford a donkey; only beggars could not ride. Streets were
paved, had raised sidewalks, and were lighted at night; one could travel
for ten miles by the light of street lamps, and along an uninterrupted
series of buildings. 63 Over the quiet Guadalquivir Arab engi- neers
threw a great stone bridge of seventeen arches, each fifty spans in
width. One of the earliest undertakings of Abd-er-Rahman I was an aque-
duct that brought to Cordova an abundance of fresh water for homes, gar-
dens, fountains, and baths. The city was famous for its pleasure gardens
and promenades.</p>
<p>Abd-er-Rahman I, lonesome for his boyhood haunts, planted in Cordova
a great garden like that of the villa in which he had spent his boyhood
near Damascus, and built in it his “Palace of the Rissafah.” Later
caliphs added - tals, marble columns, mosaic floors, gilded ceilings,
and such refined decora- tion as only Moslem art could give. The palaces
of the royal family, the lords and magnates of land and trade, lined for
miles the banks of the stately stream. A concubine of Abd-er-Rahman III
left him a large fortune; he pro- posed to spend it ransoming such of
his soldiers as had been captured in war; proud searchers claimed they
could f ind none; whereupon the Caliph’s favor - ite wife, Zahra,
proposed that he build a suburb and palace to commemorate her name. For
twenty-five years (936-61) 10,000 workmen and 1500 beasts toiled to
realize her dream. The royal palace of al-Zahra that rose three miles
southwest of Cordova was lavishly designed and equipped; 1 200 marble
col- umns sustained it; its harem could accommodate 6000 women; its hall
of au- dience had ceiling and walls of marble and gold, eight doors
inlaid with ebony, ivory, and precious stones, and a basin of
quicksilver whose undulat- ing surface reflected the dancing rays of the
sun. Al-Zahra became the resi-</p>
<p>WESTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>dential center of an aristocracy renowned for the grace and polish of
its manners, the refinement of its tastes, and the breadth of its
intellectual inter- ests. At the opposite end of the city al-Mansur
constructed (978) a rival pal- ace, al-Zahira, which also gathered about
it a suburb of lords, servants, min- strels, poets, and courtesans. Both
suburbs were burned to the ground in the revolution of 1 010.</p>
<p>Normally the people forgave the luxury of their princes if these
would raise to Allah shrines exceeding their palaces in splendor and
scope. The Romans had built in Cordova a temple to Janus; the Christians
had replaced it with a cathedral; Abd-er-Rahman I paid the Christians
for the site, demol- ished the church, and replaced it with the Blue
Mosque; in 1238 the recon- quista would turn the mosque into a
cathedral; so the good, the true, and the beautiful fluctuate with the
fortunes of war. The project became the con- solation of Abd-er-
Rahman’s troubled years; he left his suburban for his city home to
superintend the operations, and hoped that he might before his death
lead the congregation in grateful prayer in this new and majestic
mosque. He died in 788, two years after laying the foundation; his son
al-Hisham con- tinued the work; each caliph, for two centuries, added a
part, till in al- Mansur’s time i t covered an area 742 by 472 feet. The
exterior showed a bat- tlemented wall of brick and stone, with irregular
towers, and a massive minaret that surpassed in size and beauty all the
minarets of the time, so that it too was numbered among the innumerab le
“wonders of the world.” 64 Nineteen portals, surmounted by horseshoe
arches elegantly carved with floral and geometrical decoration in stone,
led into the Court of Ablutions, now the Patio de los Naranjos, or Court
of Oranges. In this rectangle, paved with colored tiles, stood four
fountains, each cut from a block of solid marble so large that seventy
oxen had been needed to haul it from the quarry to the site. The mosque
proper was a forest of 1 290 columns, dividing the interior into eleven
naves and twenty-one aisles. From the column capitals sprang a variety
of arches — some semicircular, some pointed, some in horseshoe form,
most of them with voussoirs, or wedge stones, alternately red or white.
The columns of jasper, porphyry, alabaster, or marble, snatched from the
ruins of Roman or Visigothic Spain, gave by their number the impression
of limitless and bewildering space.’ The wooden ceiling was carved into
cartouches bear- ing Koranic and other inscriptions. From it hung 200
chandeliers holding 7000 cups of scented oil, fed from reservoirs of oil
in inverted Christian bells also suspended from the roof. Floor and
walls were adorned with mosaics; some of these were of enameled glass,
baked in rich colors, and often contain- ing silver or gold; after a
thousand years of wear these dados still sparkle like jewels in the
cathedral walls. One section was marked off as a sanctuary; it was paved
with silver and enameled tiles, guarded with ornate doors, deco- rated
with mosaics, roofed with three domes, and marked off with a wooden</p>
<p>304 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>screen of exquisite design. Within this sanctuary were built the
mihrab and minbar , upon which the artists lavished their maturest
skill. The mihrab itself was an heptagonal recess walled with gold;
brilliantly ornamented with enameled mosaics, marble tracery, and gold
inscriptions on a ground of crim- son and blue; and crowned by a tier of
slender columns and trefoil arches as lovely as anything in Gothic art.
The pulpit was considered the finest of its kind; it consisted of 37,000
little panels of ivory and precious woods — ebony, citron, aloe, red and
yellow sandal, all joined by gold or silver nails, and in- laid with
gems. On this minbar , in a jeweled box covered with gold-threaded
crimson silk, rested a copy of the Koran written by the Caliph Othman
and stained with his dying blood. To us, who prefer to adorn our
theaters with gilt and brass rather than clothe our cathedrals in
jewelry and gold, the deco- ration of the Blue Mosque seems extravagant;
the walls encrusted with the blood of exploited generations, the columns
confusingly numerous, the horseshoe arch as structurally weak and
aesthetically offensive as obesity on bow legs. Others, however, have
judged differently: al-Maqqari (1591-</p>
<ol start="1632" type="1">
<li>thought this mosque “unequaled in size, or beauty of design, or
tasteful arrangement of its ornaments, or boldness of execution”; 05 and
even its di - minished Christian form is ranked as “by universal consent
th e most beauti- ful Moslem temple in the world.” 66</li>

<p>It was a common saying in Moorish Spain that “when a musician dies at
Cordova, and his instruments are to be sold, they are sent to Seville;
when a rich man dies at Seville, and his library is to be s old, it is
sent to Cordova.” 67 For Cordova in the tenth century was the focus and
summit of Spanish intel- lectual life, though Toledo, Granada, and
Seville shared actively in the men- tal exhilaration of the time. Moslem
historians picture the Moorish cities as beehives of poets, scholars,
jurists, physicians, and scientists; al-Maqqari fills sixty pages with
their names. 08 Primary schools were numerous, but charged tuition;
Hakam II added twenty-seven schools for the free instruction of the
poor. Girls as well as boys went to school; several Moorish ladies
became prominent in literature or art. 69 Higher education was provided
by independ- ent lecturers in the mosques; their courses constituted the
loosely organized University of Cordova, which in the tenth and eleventh
centuries was second in renown only to similar institutions in Cairo and
Baghdad. Colleges were established also at Granada, Toledo, Seville,
Murcia, Almeria, Valencia, Cadiz. 70 The technique of paper making was
brought in from Baghdad, and books increased and multiplied. Moslem
Spain had seventy libraries; rich men displayed their Morocco bindings,
and bibliophiles collected rare or beauti- fully illuminated books. The
scholar al-Hadram, at an auction in Cordova, found himself persistently
outbid for a book he desired, until the price of- fered far exceeded the
value of the volume. The successful bidder explained that there was a
vacant place in his library, into which this book would pre-</p>

<p>3°5</p>
<p>cisely fit. “I was so vexed,” adds al - Hadram, “that I could not
help saying to him, ‘He gets the nut who has no teeth.’” 71</p>
<p>Scholars were held in awesome repute in Moslem Spain, and were con-
sulted in simple faith that learning and wisdom are one. Theologians and
grammarians could be had by the hundred; rhetoricians, philologists,
lexicog- raphers, anthologists, historians, biographers, were legion.
Abu Muhammad Ali ibn Hazm (994-1064) , besides serving as vizier to thi
last Umayyads, was a theologian and historian of great erudition. His
Book of Religions and Sects , discussing Judaism, Zoroastrianism,
Christianity, and the principal varieties of Mohammedanism, is one of
the world’s earliest essays in comparative re - ligion. If we wish to
know what an educated Moslem thought of medieval Christianity we need
only read one of his paragraphs:</p>
<p>Human superstition need never excite our astonishment. The most</p>
<p>numerous and civilized nations are thralls to it So great is the
mul-</p>
<p>titude of Christians that God alone can number them, and they can</p>
<p>boast of sagacious princes and illustrious philosophers. Nevertheless
they believe that one is three and three are one; that one of the three
is the Father, the other the Son, and the third the Spirit; that the</p>
<p>Father is the Son and is not the Son; that a man is God and not God;
that the Messiah has existed from all eternity, and yet was created.</p>
<p>A sect of theirs, the Monophysites, numbered by hundreds of thou-
sands, believes that the Creator was scourged, buffeted, crucified, and
that for three days the universe was without a ruler. 72</p>
<p>Ibn Hazm, for his part, believed that every word of the Koran was
literally true. 73</p>
<p>Science and philosophy, in Moslem Spain, were largely frustrated by
the fear that they would damage the people’s faith. Maslama ibn Ahmad
(d.</p>
<p>1007), of Madrid and Cordova, adapted the astronomic tables of al-
Khwarizmi to Spain. A work doubtfully attributed to him describes one of
the many experiments by which alchemy was transmuted into chemistry —
the production of mercuric oxide from mercury. Ibrahim al-Zarqali ( c .
1029-87) of Toledo made an international name by improving astronomical
instruments; Copernicus quoted his treatise on the astrolabe; his
astronomical observations were the best of his age, and enabled him to
prove for the first time the motion of the solar apogee with reference
to the stars; his “Toledan Tables” of planetary movements were used
throughout Europe. Abul Qasim al-Zahrawi (936-1013), physician to
Abd-er-Rahman III, was honored in Christendom as Abulcasis; he stands at
the top of Moslem surgeons; his medi- cal encyclopedia, al-Tasrif ,
included three books on surgery which, trans- lated into Latin, became
the standard text of surgery for many centuries. Cordova was in this
period the favorite resort of Europeans for surgical operations. Like
every civilized city, it had its quota of quacks and money-</p>
<p>306 the age of faith (chap, xiii</p>
<p>mad physicians. One Harrani announced a secret specific against
intestinal troubles, and sold it at fifty dinars (37.50) a phial to
moneyed fools. 74</p>
<p>“We forbear,” says al - Maqqari, “to mention the poets who flourished
un - der Hisham II and al-Mansur, for they were as numerous as the sands
of the ocean.” 75 Among them was the princess Wallada (d. 1087); her
home at Cordova was a veritable salon of the French Enlightenment; wits,
scholars, and poets gathered round her; she made love to a score of
them, and wrote about her amours with a freedom that would have shocked
Mme. Recamier. Her friend Mugha outdid her in beauty of person and
licentiousness of verse. Almost everyone in Andalusia was a poet in
those days, and exchanged im- provised rhymes at any provocation. The
caliphs joined in the sport; and there was seldom a Moorish prince who
did not have at his court a poet not only honored but paid. This royal
patronge did some injury as well as good; the poetry that has reached us
from this age is too often artificial, flowery, lame with laborious
similes, and clogged with petty conceits. The theme was love, carnal or
Platonic; in Spain, as in the East, the Moslem singers antici- pated the
methods, moods, and philosophy of the troubadours. 76</p>
<p>From this dancing galaxy we take one star: Said ibn Judi, son of the
prefect of Cordova; an excellent warrior, a constant lover in the plural
sense, a master of all the qualities that in Moslem judgment made a
perfect gentleman: lib- erality, courage, skillful horsemanship, good
looks, eloquence, poetic talent, strength, and the arts of fencing,
wielding the spear, and bending the bow. 77 He was never sure which he
loved the more — love or war. Sensitive to the slightest touch of a
woman, he suffered a series of infatuations, each of which had every
promise of perpetuity. Like a good troubadour, he loved most ar- dently
where he had seen least; his warmest ode was to Jehane, of whom he had
seen only a lily hand. He was a candid epicurean, and felt that the
burden of proof was always on the moralist. “The sweetest morsel in
life,” he said, “is when the wine cup goes around; when, after a
quarrel, the lovers are reconciled, embrace, and are at peace. I
traverse the circle of pleasures as a frenzied war horse that has taken
the bit in its teeth. I leave no desire unsatis- fied! Steadfast when
the angel of death hovers over my head in the day of battle, a pair of
bright eyes can sway me as they will.” 78 His fellow warriors</p>
<p>A more heroic end came to a greater poet, al-Mutamid, Emir of
Seville. Like other kinglets of disintegrating Spain, he had for several
years paid trib- ute to Alfonso VI of Castile as a bribe to Christian
peace. But a bribe always leaves a balance to be paid on demand. With
the sinews of war provided by his prey, Alfonso pounced upon Toledo in
1085; and al-Mutamid perceived that Seville might be next. The
city-states of Moslem Spain were now too weakened by class and
internecine war to offer any adequate resistance. But</p>

<p>307</p>
<p>across the Mediterranean there had arisen a new Moslem dynasty; it
was called Almoravid from the marabout or patron saint of northwestern
Africa; founded on religious fanaticism, it had turned almost every man
into a soldier of Allah, and its armies had easily conquered all
Morocco. At this juncture the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin, a man of
courage and cunning, re- ceived from the princes of Spain an invitation
to rescue them from the Chris- tian dragon of Castile. Yusuf transported
his army across the Strait, received reinforcements from Malaga,
Granada, and Seville, and met the forces of Alfonso at Zallalca, near
Badajoz (1086). Alfonso sent a courtly message to Yusuf: “Tomorrow
〔Friday〕 is your holyday, and Sunday is ours; I propose, therefore,
that we join battle on Saturday.” Yusuf agreed; Alfonso attacked</p>
<p>Four years later he came back. Al-Mutamid had urged him to destroy
the power of Alfonso, who was rearming for a fresh assault. Yusuf fought
the Christians indecisively, and assumed sovereign power over Moslem
Spain. The poor welcomed him, always preferring new masters to old; the
intellec- tual classes opposed him as representing religious reaction;
the theologians embraced him. He took Granada without a blow, and
delighted the people by abolishing all taxes not prescribed in the Koran
( 1 090) . Al-Mutamid and other emirs joined in a league against him,
and formed a holy alliance with Alfonso. Yusuf besieged Cordova; its
populace delivered it to him. He sur- rounded Seville; al-Mutamid fought
heroically, saw his son killed, broke down in grief, and surrendered. By
1091 all Andalusia except Saragossa was in Yusuf’s hands, and Moslem
Spain, ruled from Morocco, was again a prov- ince of Africa.</p>
<p>Al-Mutamid was sent as a prisoner to Tangier. While there he received
from a local poet, Husri, some verses praising him and asking for a
gift. The ruined emir had now only thirty-five ducats (7) in all the
world; he sent them to Husri with apologies for the smallness of the
gift. Al-Mutamid was transferred to Aghmat, near Morocco, and lived
there for some time in chains, always in destitution, still writing
poetry, till his death ( 1095) . One of his poems might have served as
his epitaph:</p>
<p>Woo not the world too rashly, for behold,</p>
<p>Beneath the painted silk and broidering,</p>
<p>It is a faithless and inconstant thing.</p>
<p>Listen to me, Mutamid, growing old.</p>
<p>And we — that dreamed youth’s blade would never rust,</p>
<p>Hoped wells from the mirage, roses from the sand —</p>
<p>The riddle of the world shall understand</p>
<p>And put on wisdom with the robe of dust . 79</p>
