<h4 id="chapter-xvii">CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<p>The Literature of the Golden Age</p>
<p>I. PINDAR</p>
<p>N ormally the philosophy of one age is the literature of the next:
the ideas and issues that in one generation are fought out on the field
of re- search and speculation provide in the succeeding generation the
background of drama, fiction, and poetry. But in Greece the literature
did not lag behind the philosophy; the poets were themselves
philosophers, did their own thinking, and were in the intellectual
vanguard of their time. That same conflict between conservatism and
radicalism which agitated Gr^ek religion, science, and philoso- phy
found expression also in poetry and drama, even in the writing of
history. Since excellence of artistic form was added, in Greek letters,
to depth of specu- lative thought, the literature of the Golden Age
reached heights never touched again until the days of Shakespeare and
Montaigne.</p>
<p>Because of this burden of thought, and the decay of royal or
aristocratic patronage, the fifth century was less rich than the sixth
in lyric poetry as an independent art. Pindar is the transition between
the two periods: he inherits the lyric form, but fills it with dramatic
magnificence; after him poetry breaks through its traditional limits,
and, in the Dionysian drama, combines with religion, music, and the
dance to make a greater vehicle for the splendor and passion of the
Golden Age.</p>
<p>Pindar came of a Theban family that traced its lineage back to
primitive times, and claimed to include many of the ancient heroes
commemorated in his verse. His uncle, an accomplished flutist, passed
down to Pindar much of his love for music, and something of his skill.
For advanced musical instruction the parents sent the boy to Athens,
where Lasus and Agathocles taught him choral composition. Before he was
twenty — i.e., by 502 — he returned to Thebes, and studied with the
poetess Corinna. Five times he competed against Corinna in public song,
and five times was beaten; but Corinna was very pleasing to be- hold,
and the judges were men.^ Pindar called her a sow, Simonides a crow,
himself an eagle.“* Despite this myopia his reputation rose so high that
his fel- low Thebans soon concocted a story that told how once, as the
young poet slept in the fields, some bees had settled upon his lips, and
had left their honey there.® Soon he was handsomely commissioned to
write odes in honor of princes and rich men; he was the guest of noble
families in Rhodes, Tenedos, 374</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 375</p>
<p>Corinth, and Athens, and for a time lived as royal bard at the courts
of Alexan- der I of Macedon, Theron of Acragas, and Hieron I of
Syracuse. Usually his songs were paid for in advance, very much as if a
city should in our days en- gage a composer to celebrate it with an
original composition for chorus and dance, and to conduct the
performance himself. When Pindar returned to Thebes, towards his forty-
fourth year, he was acclaimed as Boeotia’s greatest gift to Greece.</p>
<p>He worked painstakingly, composing the music for each poem, and often
training a chorus to sing it. He wrote hymns and paeans for deities,
dithyrambs for the festivals of Dionysus, parthenaia for maidens,
enkomia for celebrities, skolia for banquets, threnoi^ or dirges, for
funerals, and epimkia, or songs of victory, for winners at the
Panhellenic competitions. Of all these only forty- five odes remain,
named after the games whose heroes they honored. Of these odes, again,
only the words survive, none of the music; in judging them, we are in
the position of some future historian who, having the librettos of Wag-
ner’s operas but nothing of the scores, should li st him as a poet
rather than a composer, and should rank him by the words that once
attended upon his harmonies. Or if we picture some Chinese scholar,
unfamiliar with Christian story, reading in one evening, in lame
translation, ten Bach chorals divorced from their music and ritual, we
shall measure our justice to Pindar. When read today, ode after ode, in
the silence of the study, he is beyond comparison the dreariest outpost
in the classical landscape.</p>
<p>Only the analogy of music can explain the structure of these poems.
To Pindar, as to Simonides and Bacchylides, the form to be followed in
an epinician ode was as compulsory as sonata form in the sonatas and
symphonies of modem Europe. First came the statement of the theme — the
name and story of the athlete who had gained the prize, or of the
nobleman whose horses had drawn their chariot to victory. In general
Pindar celebrates “the wisdom of man, and his beauty, and the splendor
of his fame.”* In truth he was not much interested in his formal
subject; he sang in praise of mnners, courtesans, and kings, and was
willing to accept any promptly paying tyrant as a patron saint® if the
occa- sion gave scope to his rich imagination and his proudly intricate
verse. His topic might be anything from a mule race to the glory of
Greek civilization in all its variety and spread. He was loyal to
Thebes, and not more inspired than the Delphic oracle when he defended
Theban neutrality in the Persian War; but later he was ashamed of his
error, and went out of his way to praise the leader of the Greek defense
as “renowned Athens, rich, violet -crowned, worthy of song, bulwark of
Hellas, god- protected city.”* The Athenians are said to have given him
ten thousand drachmas (0,000) for the dithyrambs, or pro- cessional
song, in which these lines occurred;^ Thebes, we are less reliably
informed, fined him for his implied reproof, and Athens paid the
fine.®</p>
<p>37^5 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVU</p>
<p>The second part of a Pindaric ode was a selection from Greek
mythology. Here Pindar was discouragingly lavish; as Corinna complained,
he “sowed with the whole sack rather than with the hand.”® He had a high
conception of the gods, and honored them as among his best clients. He
was the favorite poet of the Delphic priesthood; during his life he
received many privileges from them, and after his death his spirit was,
with Caledonian generosity, invited to share in the first fruits offered
at Apollo’s shrine.“ He was the last defender of</p>
<p>But in sunshine ever fair</p>
<p>Abide the good, and all their nights and days</p>
<p>An equal splendor wear.</p>
<p>And never as of old with thankless toil</p>
<p>For their poor empty needs they vex the soil.</p>
<p>And plough the watery seas;</p>
<p>But dwelling with the glorious gods in ease</p>
<p>A tearless life they pass.</p>
<p>Whose joy on earth it was</p>
<p>To keep their plighted word. But, far from these.</p>
<p>Torments the rest sustain too dark for human gaze.“</p>
<p>The third and concluding section of a Pindaric ode was usually a word
of moral counsel. We must not expect any subtle philosophy here; Pindar
was no Athenian, and had probably never met or read a Sophist; his
intellect was con- sumed in his art, and no force remained for original
thought. He was satisfied to urge his victorious athletes or princes to
be modest in their success, and to show respect for the gods, their
fellow men, and their own best selves. Now and then he mingled reproof
with praise, and dared to warn Hieron against greed;“ but neither was he
afraid to say a kind word for that most maligned and loved of all goods
— money. He abhorred the revolutionists of Sicily, and warned them
almost in the words of Confucius: “Even for the feeble it is an easy
thing to shake a city to its foundation, but it is a sore struggle to
set it in its place again.’”® He liked the moderate democracy of Athens
after Salamis, but sincerely believed aristocracy to be the least
harmful of all forms of gov- ernment. Ability, he thought, lies in the
blood rather than in schooling, and</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 377</p>
<p>tends to appear in families that have shown it before. Only good
blood can prepare a man for those rare deeds that ennoble and justify
human life. “Things of a day! What are we and what not? A dream about a
shadow is man; yet when some god-given splendor falls, a glory of light
comes over him, and his life is sweet.</p>
<p>Pindar was not popular in his lifetime, and for some centuries yet he
‘will continue to enjoy the lifeless immortality of those writers whom
all men praise and no one reads. While the world was moving forward he
asked it to stand still, and it left him so far behind that though
younger than Aeschylus he seems older than Aleman. He wrote a poetry as
compact, involved, and devious as Tacitus’ prose, in an artificial and
deliberately archaic dialect of his own, in meters so elaborate that few
poets have ever cared to follow them,* and so varied that only two of
the forty-five odes have the same metrical form. He is so obscure,
despite the naivete of his thought, that grammarians spend a life- time
unraveling his Teutonic constructions, only to find, beneath them, a
mine of sonorous platitudes. If despite these faults, and his frigid
formality, and turgid metaphors, and tiresome mythology, some curious
scholars are still per- suaded to read him, it is because his narratives
are swift and vivid, his simple morality is sincere, and the splendor of
his language lifts to a passing grandeur even the humblest themes.</p>
<p>He lived to the age of eighty, secure in Thebes from the turmoil of
Athenian thought. “Dear to a man,” he sang, “is his own home city, his
comrades and his kinsmen, so that he is well content. But to foolish men
belongeth a love for things afar.”^^ Ten days before his end (442), we
are told, he sent to ask the oracle of Ammon, “What is best for man?”—
to which the Egyptian oracle ans wered, like a Greek, “Death.”“ Athens
put up a statue to him at the public cost, and the Rhodians inscribed
his seventh Olympian ode — a panegyric of their island-in letters of
gold upon a temple wall. When, in 335, Alexander ordered rebellious
Thebes to be burned to th^ ground he commanded his soldiers to leave
unharmed the house in which Pindar had lived and died.</p>

<li>THE DIONYSIAN THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>The story is told in the Lexicon of Suidas^ that during the
performance of a play by Pratinas, about 500 b.c., the wooden benches
upon which the auditors sat gave way, injuring some, and causing such
alarm that the Athenians built, on the southern slope of the Acropolis,
a theater of stone.</p>
<p>• A notable exception is Dryden’s Alexander’s Feast.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>which they dedicated to the god Dionysus.* * * § In the next two
centuries similar tlieaters rose at Eretria, Epidaurus, Argos, Mantinea,
Delphi, Tauro- menium (Taormina), Syracuse, and elsewhere in the
scattered Greek world. But it was on the Dionysian stage that the major
tragedies and comedies were first played, and fought out the bitterest
phase of that war, between the old theology and the new philosophy,
which binds into one vast process of thought and change the mental
history of the Periclean age.</p>
<p>The great theater is, of course, open to the sky. The fifteen
thousand seats, rising in a fanlike semicircle of tiers toward the
Parthenon, face Mt. Hymettus and the sea; when the persons of the drama
invoke the earth and the sky, the sun and the stars and the ocean, they
are addressing realities which most of the audience, as it listens to
the speech or chant, can directly see and feel. The seats, originally of
wood, later of stone, have no backs; many people bring cushions; but
they sit through five plays in a day with no other known support for
their spines than the unaccommodating knees of the auditors behind them.
In the front rows are a few marble seats with backs for the local high
priests of Dionysus and the officials of the city.f At the foot of the
auditorium is an orchestra, or dancing space, for the chorus. At the
rear of this is a small wooden building known as the skene, or scene,
which serves to represent now a palace, now a temple, now a private
dwelling, and probably also to house the players while off stage. ^
There are such simple “properties”— altars, furniture, etc. — as the
story may require; in the case of Aristophanes’ Birds there are
important adjuncts of scenery and costume;” an d Agatharchus of Samos
paints backgrounds in such a way as to produce the illusion of distance.
Several mechanical de- vices help to vary the action or the place. § To
show an action that has transpired within the skerte, a wooden platform
{ekkykletm) may be wheeled out, and have human figures arranged on it in
a tableau suggestive</p>
<p>• This was not the Theater of Dionysus that tourists see today; the
surviving structure was built under the direction of the Finance
Minister Lycurgus about 338. Some parts of it are conjecturally traced
back to 421; some others appear to have been added in the first and
third centuries after Christ.</p>
<p>t This and the remarks about the stage presume that the theater built
by Lycurgus followed the general plan of the structure that it
replaced.</p>
<p>^Whether the action took place on the roof of the skency or upon the
proskenioriy or proscenium, before it, is uncertain; perhaps the action
moved from one level to the other as the location of the story
changed.</p>
<p>§ A drop curtain was used in the Roman period, being lowered into a
crevice at the begin-</p>
<p>ning of a scene, and raised at the end; but our extant plays from the
fifth century give no evi&amp;nce of this, and apparently rely on choral
interludes to serve the purpose of a curtain between the **acts.”</p>
<p>CHAP.XVn) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 379</p>
<p>of what has occurred; so a corpse may be on it, with the murderers
holding bloody weapons in their hands; it is against the traditions of
the Greek drama to represent violence directly on the stage. At either
side of the proscenium is a large, triangular, upright prism that turns
on a pivot; each face of the prism has a different scene painted on it;
and by revolving these periaktoi the background can be altered in a
moment. A still stranger apparatus is the mechane, or machine, a crane
with pulley and weights; it is placed upon the skene at the left, and is
used to lower gods or heroes from heaven down to the stage, or to raise
them back to heaven, or even to exhibit them suspended in the air.
Euripides in particular is fond of using this mechanism to let down a
god — a deus ex machina, as the Romans put it — who piously unties the
knot of his agnostic plays.</p>
<p>The tragic drama at Athens is not a secular or perennial affair, but
part of the annual celebration of the feast of Dionysus.* From among
many plays offered to the archon a few are selected for performance.
Each of the ten tribes or demes of Attica chooses one of its rich
citizens to serve as choragus, i.e., director of the chorus; it is his
privilege to pay the cost of training the singers, dancers, and actors,
and to meet the other expenses of presenting one of the compositions.
Sometimes a choragus spends a for- tune upon scenery, costumes, and
“talent”— in this way every play financed by Nicias obtains a prize;“
some other choragi economize by hiring second - hand robes from dealers
in theatrical costumes.^ The actual training of the chorus is usually
undertaken by the dramatist himself.</p>
<p>The chorus is in many ways the most important as well as the most</p>
<p>costly part of the spectacle. Often it gives its name to the drama;
and through it, for the most part, the poet expresses his views on
religion and philosophy. The history of the Greek theater is a losing
struggle of the chorus to dominate the play: at first the chorus is
everything; in Thespis and Aeschylus its role diminishes as the number
of actors increase; in the drama of the third century it disappears.
Usually the chorus is composed not of professional singers but of
amateurs chosen from the civic roster of the tribe. They are all men,
and number, after Aeschylus, fifteen. They dance as well as sing, and
move in dignified procession across the long and narrow stage,
interpreting through the poetry of motion the words and moods of the
play.</p>
<p>Music holds in the Greek drama a place second only to the action</p>
<p>and the poetry. Usually the dramatist composes the music as well as
the</p>
<p>• Plays were also presented during the lesser Dionysia, or Lenaea,
usually at the Piraeus; and at various times in the local theaters of
the Attic towns.</p>
<p>380 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>words.” Most of the dialogue is spoken or declaimed; some of it is
chanted in recitative; but the leading roles contain lyrical passages
that must be sung as solos, duets, trios, or in unison or alternation
with the chorus.” The singing is simple, without “parts” or harmony. The
accompaniment is usu - ally given by a single flute, and accords with
the voices note for note; in this way the words can be followed by the
audience, and the poem is not drowned out in the song. These plays
cannot be judged by reading them silently; to the Greeks the words are
but a part of a complex art form that weaves poetry, music, acting, and
the dance into a profound and moving unity.*</p>
<p>Nevertheless the play is the thing, and the prize is awarded less for
the music than for the drama, and less for the drama than for the
acting; a good actor can make a success of a middling play.” The actor —
who is always a male — is not disdained as in Rome, but is much honored;
he is exempt from military service, and is allowed safe passage through
the lines in time of war. He is called hypokrites, but this word means
answerer — i.e., to the cho rus; only later will the actor’s role as an
impersonator lead to the use of the word as meaning hypocrite. Actors
are organized in a strong union or guild called the Dionysian Artists,
which has members through- out Greece. Troupes of players wander from
city to city, composing their own plays and music, making their own
costumes, and setting up their own stages. As in all times, the incomes
of leading actors are very high, that of secondary actors precariously
low;” and the morals of both are what mi ght be expected of men moving
from place to place, fluctuating between lux- ury and poverty, and too
high-strung to be capable of a stable and normal life.</p>
<p>In both tragedy and comedy the actor wears a mask, fitted with a
resonant mouthpiece of brass. The acoustics of the Greek theater, and
the visibility of the stage from every seat, are remarkable; but even so
it is found ad- visable to reinforce the voice of the actor, and help
the eye of the distant spectator to distinguish readily the various
characters portrayed. All subtle play of vocal or facial expression is
sacrificed to these needs. When real individuals are represented on the
stage, like the Euripides of the Eccle-</p>
<p>• Music continued to play a central role in the culture of the
classic period (480-323). The great name among the fifth-century
composers was Timotheus of Miletus; he wrote nomes m which the music
dominated the poetry, and represented a stpiy and an action. His ex-
tension of the Greek lyre to eleven strings, and his experiments in
complex and elaborate styles, provoked the conservatives of Athens to
such denunciation that Timotheus, we are told, was about to take his own
life when Euripides comforted him, collaborated with him, and correctly
prophesied that all Greece would soon be at his feet.“</p>
<p>CHAP.XVn) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 381</p>
<p>siazTtsae and the Socrates of the Clouds, the masks imitate, and
largely cari- cature, their actual features. The masks have come down
into the drama from religious performances, in which they were often
instruments of ter- ror or humor; in comedy they continue this
tradition, and are as grotesque and extravagant as Greek fancy can make
them. Just as the actor’s voice is strengthened and his countenance
enlarged by the mask, so his dimen- sions are extended with padding, and
his height is enhanced by an onkos, or projection on his head, and by
kothomoi, or thick-soled shoes, on his feet. All in all, as Lucian puts
it, the ancient actor makes a “hideous and appalling spe ctacle.””</p>
<p>The audience is as interesting as the play. Men and women of all
ranks are admitted,” and after 420 all citizens who need it receive from
the state</p>
<p>There are three days of drama at the city Dionysia; on each day five
plays are presented — three tragedies and a satyr play by one poet, and
a comedy by another.” The performance begins early in the morning and
continues till dusk. Only in exceptional cases is a play performed twice
in the Theater of Dionysus; those who have missed it there may see it in
the theaters of other Greek cities, or with less splendor on some rural
stage in Attica. Between 480 and 380 some two thousand new dramas are
performed at Athens .” In early times the prize for the best tragic
trilogy was a goat, for</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>382</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>the best comedy a basket of figs and a jug of wine; but in the Golden
Age the three prizes for tragedy and the single prize for comedy take
the form of grants of money by the state. The ten judges are chosen by
lot in the theater itself on the first morning of the competition, out
of a large list of candidates nominated by the Council. At the end of
the last play each of the judges writes his selections for first,
second, and third prizes upon a tablet; the tablets are placed in an um,
and an archon draws out five tablets at random. These five judgments,
summed up, constitute the final award, and the other five are destroyed
unread; no one, therefore, can know in advance who the judges are to be,
or which of them will really judge. Despite these precautions there is
some corruption or intimidation of judges.” Plato complains that the
judges, through fear of the crowd, almost alwa ys decide according to
the applause, and argues that this “theatroc - racy” is debasing both
the dramatists and the audience.” When the contest</p>
<p>The size of the theater and the traditions of the festival determine
in large measure the nature of the Greek drama. Since nuances cannot be
conveyed by facial expression or vocal inflection, subtle character
portraits are rare in the Dionysian theater. The Greek drama is a study
of fate, or of man in conflict with the gods; the Elizabethan drama is a
study of action, or of man in conflict with man; the modem drama is a
study of character, or of man in conflict with himself. The Athenian
audience knows in ad- vance the destiny of each person represented, and
the issue of each action; for religious custom is still strong enough in
the fifth century to limit the theme of the Dionysian drama to some
story from the accepted myths and legends of the early Greeks.* There is
no suspense and no surprise, but, instead, the pleasures of anticipation
and recognition. Dramatist after dramatist tells the same tale to the
same audience; what differs is the poetry, the music, the
interpretation, and the philosophy. Even the philosophy, before
Euripides, is determined in large measure by tradition: throughout</p>
<p>•There were a few dramas about later his tory; of these the only
extant example is Aeschylus’ Persian Women. About 493 Phrynichus
presented The Fall of Miletus; but the Athenians were so moved to grief
by contemplating the capture of their daughter city by the Persians that
they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for his innovation, and
forbade any repetition of the play.“ There are some indications that
Themistodes had secretly</p>

<p>Aeschylus and Sophocles the prevailing theme is the nemesis of
punish- ment, by jealous gods or impersonal fate, for insolent
presumption and irreverent pride (hybris ) ; and the recurring moral is
the wisdom of con- science, honor, and a modest moderation (aidos). It
is this combination of philosophy with poetry, action, music, song, and
dance that makes the Greek drama not only a new form in the history of
literature, but one that almost at the outset achieves a grandeur never
equaled again.</p>
<p>HI. AESCHYLUS</p>
<p>Not quite at the outset; for as many talents, in heredity and
history, pre- pare the way for a genius, so some lesser playwrights, who
may here be forgotten with honor, intervened between Thespis and
Aeschylus, Per- haps it was the successful resistance to Persia that
gave Athens the pride and stimulus necessary to an age of great drama,
while the wealth that came with trade and empire after the war provided
for the costly Dionysian con- tests in dithyrambic singing and the
choral play. Aeschylus felt both the stimulus and the pride in person.
Like so many Greek writers of the fifth century, he lived as well as
wrote, and knew how to do as well as to speak. In 499, at the age of
twenty-six, he produced his first play; in 490 he and his two brothers
fought at Marathon, and so bravely that Athens ordered a painting to
commemorate their deeds; in 484 he won his first prize at the Dionysian
festival; in 480 he fought at Artemisium and Salamis, and in 479 at
Plataea; in 476 and 470 he visited Syracuse, and was honored at the
court of Hieron I; in 468, after dominating Athenian literature for a
generation, he lost the first prize for drama to the youthful Sophocles;
in 467 he recaptured supremacy with his Seven against Thebes; in 458 he
won his last and greatest victory with the Oresteia trilogy; in 456 he
was again in Sicily; and there, in that year, he died.</p>
<p>It took a man of such energy to mold the Greek drama into its classic
form. It was Aeschylus who added a second actor to the one drawn out
from the chorus by Thespis, and thereby completed the transformation of
the Dionysian chant from an oratorio into a play.* He wrote seventy
(some say ninety) dramas, of which seven remain. Of these, the
earliest</p>
<p>• Though in Aeschylus the actors were only two, the roles they played
in a drama were — attendants, soldiers, etc. — were not counted as
actors.</p>
<p>384 THE LIFE OF GREECE ( CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>three are minor works;* the most famous is the Prometheus Bound; the
greatest make up the Oresteia trilogy.</p>
<p>The Prometheus Bounds too, may have been part of a trilogy, though no
ancient authority vouches for this. We hear of a satyr play by Aeschy-
lus called Prometheus the Fire Bringer; but it was produced apart from
the Prometheus Bounds in a quite different combination.““ Fragments sur-
vive of a Prometheus Unbound by Aeschylus; these are well-nigh mean-
ingless, but anxious scholars assure us that if we had the full text we
should find Aeschylus answering satisfactorily all the heresies which
the extant play puts int o the hero’s lines. Even so it is noteworthy
that an Athenian audience, at a religious festival, should have put up
with the Titan’s blasphemies. As the play opens we find Prometheus being
chained to a rock in the Caucasus by Hephaestus at the command of a Zeus
irate because Prometheus has taught men the art of fire. Hephaestus
speaks:</p>
<p>High-thoughted son of Themis, who is sage!</p>
<p>Thee loath I loath must rivet fast in chains</p>
<p>Against this rocky height unclomb by man,</p>
<p>^ere never human voice nor face shall find</p>
<p>Out thee who lov’st them; and thy beauty’s flower.</p>
<p>Scorched in the sun’s clear heat shall fade away.</p>
<p>Night shall come up with garniture of stars</p>
<p>To comfort thee with shadow, and the sun</p>
<p>Disperse with retrickt beams the morning frosts;</p>
<p>But through all dangers sense of present woe</p>
<p>Shall vex thee sore, because with none of them</p>
<p>There comes a hand to free. Such fruit is plucked</p>
<p>From love of man! . . . For Zeus is stern,</p>
<p>And new-made kings are cruel.“</p>
<p>Hanging helpless on the crag, Prometheus hurls defiance to Olympus,
and recounts proudly the steps by which he brought civilization to
primi- tive men, who till then</p>
<p>lived like silly ants beneath the ground</p>
<p>In hollow caves unsunned. There came to them</p>
<p>No steadfast sign of winter, nor of spring</p>
<p>Flower-perfumed, nor of summer full of fruit;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Suppliant Women is of the primitive type, in which the chorus
predominates; The Persians is also mostly choral, and vividly describes
the battle of Salamis; the Seven against Thebes was the third play in a
trilogy that told the story of King Laius and his queen Jocasta, the
patricide and incest of their son Oedipus, and the conflict between the
sons of Oedipus for the Theban throne.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 385</p>
<p>But blindly and lawlessly they did all things,</p>
<p>Until I taught them how the stars do rise</p>
<p>And set in mystery, and devised for them</p>

<p>The synthesis of letters, and besides.</p>
<p>The artificer of all things, memory</p>
<p>That sweet muse-mother. I was first to yoke</p>
<p>The servile beasts. . . .</p>
<p>And none but I originated ships. . . .</p>
<p>And I,</p>
<p>Who did devise for mortals all these arts.</p>
<p>Have no device left now to save myself.“</p>
<p>The whole earth mourns with him. “There is a cry in the waves of the
sea as they fall together, and a groaning in the deep; a wail comes up
from the cavern realms of death.” All the nations send their condolences
to this political prisoner, and bid him remember that suffering visits
all: “Grief walks t he earth, and sits down at the feet of each by
turns.” But they do nothing to free him. Oceanus advises him to yield,
“seeing that who reigns, reigns by cruelty instead of right”; and the
chorus of Oceanids, daughters of the sea, wonder whether humanity
deserves to be suffered for with such a crucifixion. “Nay, thine was a
helpless sacrifice, O beloved. . . . Didst thou not see the race of men,
how little in effort and energy, dream- ers bound in chains.^*”“
Nevertheless they so admire him that when Z eus threatens to hurl him
down into Tartarus they stay by him, and face with him the thunderbolt
that blasts them and Prometheus into the abyss. But Prometheus, being a
god, is denied the easement of death. In the lost conclusion of the
trilogy he is raised up from Tartarus to be again chained to a mountain
rock, and a vulture is commissioned by Zeus to gnaw out the Titan’s
heart. The heart grows by night as fast as the vulture consumes it by
day; in this way Prometheus suffers through thirteen generations of men.
Then the kindly giant Heracles kills the vulture, and persuades Zeus to
free Prometheus. The Titan repents, makes his peace with Omnipo- tence,
and places upon his finger the iron ring of necessity.</p>
<p>In this simple and powerful trilogy Aeschylus set the theme of Greek
drama — the struggle of human will against inescapable destiny — and the
theme of the hfe of Greece in the fifth century — the conflict between
re- bellious thought and traditional belief. His conclusion is
conservative, but he knows the case for the rebel, and gives it all his
sympathy; not even in Euripides shall we find so critical a view of
Olympus. This is another</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>(chap, xvn</p>
<p>Paradise Lost in which the Fallen Angel, despite the poet’s piety, is
the hero of the tale. Probably Milton often recalled Aeschylus’ Titan
when he composed such eloquent speeches for Satan. Goethe was fond of
this play, and used Prometheus as a mouthpiece in irreverent youth;
Byron made him the model of nearly all his selves; and Shelley, always
at odds with fate, brought the story back to life in Prometheus Unbound,
where the rebel never yields. The legend hides a dozen allegories:
suffering is the fruit of the tree of knowledge; to know the future is
to g naw one’s heart away; the liberator is always crucified; and in the
end one must accept limits, man muss entsagen, must accomplish his
purpose within the nature of things. This is a noble theme, and helps
the majestic language of Aeschylus to make the Prometheus a tragedy in
the “grand style.” Never has the - self.”“</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Oresteia is greater still — by common consent the
finest achievement in Greek drama, perhaps in all drama.“ It was
produced in 458, probably two years after Prometheus Bound, and two
years before the author’s death. The theme is the fateful breeding of
violence by vio - lence, and the inescapable punishment, through
generation after genera- tion, of insolent pride and excess. We call it
a legend but the Greeks, per- haps rightly, called it history. The
story, as told by each of the greater dramatists of Greece, might be
called The Children of Tantalus, for it was he, the Phrygian king so
recklessly proud in his wealth, who began the long chain of crime, and
called down the vengeance of the Furies, by steal- ing the nectar and
ambrosia of the gods, and giving the divine food to Pelops, his son; in
every age some men acquire more wealth than befits a man, and use it to
spoil their children. We have seen how Pelops, by foul means, won the
throne of Elis, slew his accomplice, and married the daugh- ter of the
king whom he had deceived and killed. By Hippodameia he had three
children: Thyestes, Aerope, and Atreus. Thyestes seduced Aerope; Atreus,
to avenge his sister, served up his brother’s children to him at a
banquet; whereupon Aegisthus, son of Thyestes by Thyestes’ daughter,
vowed vengeance upon Atreus and his line. Atreus had two sons, Aga-
memnon and Menelaus. Agamemnon married Clytaemnestra, and had by her two
daughters, Iphigenia and Electra, and one son, Orestes. At Aulis,</p>
<p>CHAP.XVn) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 387</p>
<p>where his ships were becalmed on the way to Troy, Agamemnon, to the
horror of Clytaemnestra, sacrificed Iphigenia to induce die winds to
blow. While Agamemnon besieged Troy, Aegisthus courted his brooding
wife, won her, and plotted with her to kill the King. It is at this
point that</p>
<p>Aeschylus takes up the tale.</p>
<p>The news has come to Argos that the war is over, and proud Agamem-
non — “robed in steel, and armies trembled at his wrath”— has landed on
Peloponnesian shores, and is approaching Mycenae. A Chorus of Elders
appears before the royal palace, and in ominous chant recalls Agamem-
non’s aba ndomnent of Iphigenia:</p>
<p>In that which Must Be he armed him slowly.</p>
<p>And a strange wind within his bosom tossed,</p>
<p>A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;</p>
<p>And he rose up, daring to the uttermost.</p>
<p>For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying</p>
<p>Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter.</p>
<p>Yea, and itself is grief.</p>
<p>So this man hardened to his own child’s slaying.</p>
<p>As help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter.</p>
<p>And bring his ships relief. . . .</p>
<p>With violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath</p>
<p>Her stole of saffron to the ground she threw.</p>
<p>And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path</p>
<p>To each man’s heart that slew:</p>
<p>A face in a picture, striving amazedly;</p>
<p>The little maid who danced at her father’s board.</p>
<p>The innocent voice man’s love came never nigh.</p>
<p>Who joined to his her little paean-cry</p>
<p>When the third cup was poured.“</p>
<p>Agamemnon’s herald enters to announce the coming of the King. Aes -
chylus realizes with fine imagination the joy of the simple soldier as
he sets foot, after a long absence, upon his native soil; now, says the
herald, “I am ready, if God will, to die.” He describes to the Chorus
the terror and filth of the war, the rain that sent a moisture into the
bones, the vermin that multiplied in the hair, the breathless heat of
Ilion’s summer, and the winter so cold that all the birds fell dead.
Clytaemnestra comes from the palace, somber, nervous, and yet proud, and
orders rich hangings to be strewn for Agamenmon’s path. The King enters
in the royal chariot,</p>
<p>388 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVH</p>
<p>escorted by his troops, and erect in the pride of victory. Behind him
is another chariot, bearing the darkly beautiful Cassandra, Trojan
princess and prophetess, the resentful slave of Agamemnon’s lust, who
bitterly pre - dicts his punishment, and gloomily foresees her own
death. With clever speech Clytaemnestra recounts to the King her years
of longing for this return. “For you indeed the rushing fountains of my
tears have run dry, and there is no drop left. But in my eyes, worn with
late watching, you may see how I sorrowed for the signals of your
victory that ever tarried; and in my disturbed sleep I started at the
faint buzzing of the gnat’s wing, for I dreamt of you long tales of woe,
crowded into a short moment of rep ose.”“ He suspects her sincerity, and
reproves her dourly for the lavish outlay of broidered hangings under
his horses’ feet; but he follows her into the palace, and Cassandra
resignedly accompanies him. Through an intense pause in the action the
Chorus intones softly a song of evil premoni- tion. Then from within
comes the cry towards which every line of the drama has moved, the death
cry of Agamemnon slain by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra. The portals open;
Clytaemnestra is shown with ax in hand and blood on her brow, standing
triumphant over the corpses of Cassandra and the King; and the Chorus
chants the end:</p>
<p>Would God that suddenly.</p>
<p>With no great agony.</p>
<p>No long sick-watch to keep.</p>
<p>My hour would come to me.</p>
<p>My hour, and presently</p>
<p>Bring the eternal, the</p>
<p>Unwaking Sleep,</p>
<p>Now that my Shepherd, he</p>
<p>Whose love watched over me,</p>
<p>Lies in the deep.“</p>
<p>The second play in the trilogy, the Choephorae, or Libation Bearers,
takes its title from the chorus of women who bring offerings to the
grave of the King. Clytaemnestra has sent her young son Orestes to be
reared in distant Phocis, hoping that he may forget his father’s death.
But old men there teach him the ancient law of vengeance: “The shed drop
doth crave new blood”; the state, in those dark days, left the
punishment of mur- der to the dead man’s kin; and men believed that the
soul of the slain would know no peace till he had been avenged. Orestes,
haunted and horrified with the thought of his mission — to kill his
mother anjl Aegisthus — comes secretly to Argos with his comrade
Pylades, seeks out his father’s tomb.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 389</p>
<p>and lays upon it a lock of his hair. Hearing the approach of the
Libation Bearers, the young men withdraw, and listen in fascination as
Electra, Orestes’ brooding sister, comes with the women, stands over the
grave, and calls upon Agamemnon’s spirit to arouse Orestes to avenge
him. Orestes reveals himself; and from her bitter heart she pours into
his simple mind the thought that he must kill their mother. The youths,
disguised as mer- chants, proceed to the royal palace; Clytaemnestra
softens them with hos- pitality; but when Orestes tests her by saying
that the boy she sent to Phocis is dead, he is shocked to see a secret
joy hiding in her grief. She calls Aegisthus to share with him the news
that the avenger whom they feared is no more. Orestes slays him, drives
his mother into the palace, and comes out a moment later already half
insane with the consciousness that he is a matricide.</p>
<p>While I am still not mad I here declare</p>
<p>To all who love me, and confess, that I</p>
<p>Have slain my mother.”</p>
<p>In the third play Orestes is pursued, in the poet’s externalization
of the boy’s wild fancy, by the Erirmyes, or Furies, w hose task it is
to punish crime; and from their euphemistic, deprecatory title, the
Eumenides, or Well-Wishers, the play derives its name. Orestes is an
outcast, shunned by all men; wherever he goes the Furies hang over him
as black ghosts crying out for his blood. He flings himself upon the
altar of Apollo at Delphi, and Apollo comforts him; but the shade of
Clytaemnestra rises from the earth to urge the Furies not to desist from
torturing her son. Orestes goes to Athens, kneels before Athena’s shri
ne, and cries out to her for de- liverance. Athena hears him, and calls
him “perfect by suffering.” When the Erinnyes protest she summons them
to try Orestes’ case before the Council of the Areopagus; the concluding
scene shows this strange trial, symbolical of the replacement of blood
revenge with law. Athena, god- dess of the city, presides; the Furies
state the case for vengeance against Orestes, and Apollo defends him.
The court divides evenly; Athena casts the deciding ballot in favor of
Orestes, and declares him free. She</p>
<p>solemnly establishes the Council of the Areopagus as henceforth the
su- preme court of Attica, whose swift condemnation of the murderer
shall free the land from feuds, and whose wisdom will guide the state
through the dangers that beset every people. The goddess by her fair
speech ap- peases Ae disappointed Furies, and so wins them that their
leader says, “This day a new Order is bom.”</p>
<p>390 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>After the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Oresteia is the highest
achievement in Greek literature. Here is a breadth of conception, a
unity of thought and execution, a power of dramatic development, an
understanding of character, and a splendor of style which in their sum
we shall not find again before Shakespeare. The trilogy is as closely
knit as the three acts of a well-designed drama; each part foreshadows
and requires the next with logical inevitability. As play succeeds play
the terror of the theme</p>
<p>grows until we begin dimly to realize how deeply this story must have
moved the Greeks. It is true that there is too much talk, even for four
murders; that the lyrics are often obscure, their metaphors exaggerated,
their language sometimes heavy and rough and strained. Nevertheless
these chorals are supreme in their kind, full of grandeur and
tenderness, elo- quent with their plea for a new religion of
forgiveness, and for the virtues of a political order that was passing
away.</p>
<p>For the Oresteia is as conservative as the Frometheus is radical,
though only two years seem to have separated them in time. In 462
Ephialtes de- prived the Areopagus of its powers; in 461 he was
assassinated; in 458 Aeschylus offered in the Oresteia a defense of the
Council of the Areopagus as the wisest body in the Athenian government.
The poet was now full of years, and could understand the old more easily
than the young; like Aristophanes he longed for the virtues of the men
of Marathon. Athenaeus would have us believe that Aeschylus was a great
drinker;” but in the Oresteia he is a Puritan preaching a sermon in
buskins on sin and its pun- ishment, and the wisdom bom of suffering.
The law of hybris and nemesis is another doctrine of karma, or of
original sin; every evil deed will be found out, and be avenged in one
life or another. In this way Greek</p>
<p>thought made its trial at reconciling evil with God: all suffering is
due to sin, even if it is the sin of a generation that is dead. The
author of Prome- theus was no naive pietist; his plays, even in the
Oresteia, are studded with heresies; he was attacked for revealing
ritual secrets, and was saved only by the intercession of his brother
Ameinias, who bared before the Assem- bly the wounds he had received at
Salamis.” But Aeschylus was con - vinced that morality, to hold its own
against unsocial impulse, required supernatural sanctions; he hoped
that</p>
<p>One there is who heareth on high —</p>
<p>Some Pan or Zeus, some seer Apollo —</p>
<p>And sendeth down, for the law ttan^ressed.</p>
<p>The Wrath of the Feet that follow.?</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>CHAP.XVn) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>— i.e., the Furies of conscience and retribution. Therefore he speaks
with a solemn reverence for religion, and makes an effort to reach
beyond poly- theism to the conception of one God.</p>
<p>Zeus, Zeus, whate’er He be.</p>
<p>If this name He love to hear.</p>
<p>This He shall be called of me.</p>
<p>Searching earth and sea and air</p>
<p>Refuge nowhere can I find</p>
<p>Save Him only, if my mind</p>
<p>Will cast off, before it die.</p>
<p>The burden of this vanity.”</p>
<p>He identifies Zeus with the personified Nature of Things, the Law or
Rea- son of the World; “The Law that is Fate and the Father and All
-compre- hending are here met together as one.”“</p>
<p>Perhaps these concluding lines of his masterpiece were his last words
as a poet. Two years after the Oresteia we find him again in Sicily.
Some believe that the audience, being more radical than the judges, did
not like the trilogy; but this hardly accords with the fact that the
Athenians, a few years later, and directly contrary to custom, decreed
that his plays might be repeated in the Theater of Dionysus, and that a
chorus should be granted to anyone who offered to produce them. Many
did, and Aeschylus con- tinued to win prizes after his death. Meanwhile
in Sicily, says an old story, an eagle had killed him by dropping a
tortoise upon his bald head, mistak- ing it for a stone.” There he was
buried over his own epitaph, so strangely silent about his plays, so
humanly proud of his scars:</p>
<p>Beneath this stone lies Aeschylus;</p>
<p>Of his noble prowess the grove of Marathon can speak.</p>
<p>Or the long-haired Persian, who knows it well.</p>

<p>The first prize for tragedy was won from Aeschylus in 468 by a new-
comer, aged twenty-seven, and bearing a name that meant the Wise and
Honored One. Sophocles was the most fortunate of men, and almost the
darkest of pessimists. He came from Colonus, a suburb of Athens, and was
the son of a sword manufacturer, so that the Persian and Peloponnesian
Wars, which impoverished nearly all Athenians, left the dramatist a com-
fortable income.“ In addition to wealth he had genius, beauty, and
good</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>392</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>health. He won the double prize for wrestling and music — a
combination that would have pleased Plato; his skill as a ballplayer and
a harpist enabled him to give public performances in both fields; and
after the battle of Salamis it was he who was chosen by the city to lead
the nude youths of Athens in a dance and song of victory .“ Even in
later years he w as hand- some; the Lateran Museum statue shows him old
and bearded and rounded, but still vigorous and tall. He grew up in the
happiest age of Athens; he was the friend of Pericles, and held high
offices under him; in 443 he was Imperial Treasurer; in 440 he was one
of the generals who commanded the Athenian forces in Pericles’
expedition against Samos— though it should be added that Pericles
preferred his poetry to his strategy. After the Athenian debacle in
Syracuse he was appointed to the Committee of Public Safety;‘“ and in
this capacity he voted for the oligarchical constitu- tion of 41 1. His
character pleased the people more than his politics; he was genial,
witty, unassuming, pleasure-loving, and endowed with a charm that atoned
for all hi s errors. He had a fancy for money’” and boys,‘” but in his
old age he turned his favor to courtesans.’” He was very pious, and
pccasionally filled the office of priest.“</p>
<p>He wrote 1 1 3 plays; we have only seven, and do not know the order
in which they were produced. Eighteen times he won the first award at
the Dionysian, twice at the Lenaean, festivals; he received his first
prize at twenty-five, his last at eighty-five; for thirty years he ruled
the Athenian stage more completely than Pericles contemporaneously ruled
Athens. He increased the number of actors to three, and played a role
himself until he lost his voice. He (and after him Euripides) abandoned
the Aeschylean form of trilogy, preferring to compete with three
independent plays. Aeschylus was interested in cosmic themes that
overshadowed the persons of his drama; Sophocles was interested in
character, and was almost mod- em in his flair for psychology. The
Trachinicm Women is on its surface a sensational melodrama: Deianeira,
jealou s of her husband and Heracles’ love for lola, sends him
unwittingly a poisoned robe, and, when it con- sumes him, kills herself;
what draws Sophocles here is not the punishment of Heracles, which would
have seemed central to Aeschylus — nor even the passion of love, which
would have attracted Euripides — but the psy- chology of jealousy. So in
the Ajax no attention is paid to the mighty deeds of the hero; what
lures the author is the study of a man going mad. In the Philoctetes
there is almost no action, but a frank analysis of injured simplicity
and diplomatic dishonesty. In the Electra the story is as slight as it
is old; Aeschylus was fascinated by the moral issues involved;
Sopho-</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 393</p>
<p>cles almost ignores them in his eagerness to study with
psychoanalytic ruth- lessness the young woman’s hatred of her mother.
The play has given its name to a neurosis once widely discussed, as
Oedipus the King has pro- vided a name for another.</p>
<p>Oedipus Tyramius is the most famous of Greek dramas. Its opening</p>
<p>scene is impressive: a motley throng of men, women, boys, girls, and
in- fants sit before the royal palace in Thebes, carrying boughs of
laurel and olive as symbols of supplication. A plague has fallen upon
the city, and the people have gathered to beg King Oedipus to offer some
appeasing sacrifice to the gods. An oracle announces that the plague
will leave Thebes with the unknown assassin of Laius, the former king.
Oedipus lays a bitter curse upon the murderer, whoever he may be, whose
crime has brought such miser)’^ to Thebes. This is a perfect instance of
that method which Horace advised, of plunging in medias res, and letting
explanations enter afterward. But the audience, of course, knew the
story, for the tale of Laius, Oedipus, and the Sphinx was part of the
folklore of the Greeks. Tradition said that a curse had been laid upon
Laius and his children be- cause he had introduced an unnatural vice
into Hellas the consequences of this sin, ruining generation after
generation, formed a typical theme for Greek tragedy. Laius and his
queen Jocasta, said an oracle, would have a son who would slay his
father and marry his mother. For once in the world’s history two parents
wanted a girl for their f irst child. But a son came; and to avoid
fulfillment of the oracle he was exposed on the hills. A shepherd found
him, called him Oedipus from his swollen feet, and gave him to the king
and queen of Corinth, who reared him as their son. Grown to manhood,
Oedipus learned, again from the oracle, that he was destined to kill his
father and marry his mother. Believing the king and queen of Corinth to
be his parents, he fled from that city and took the road to Thebes. On
the way he met an old man, quarreled with him, and slew him, not knowing
that the old man was his father. Nearing Thebes he encountered the
Sphinx, a creature with the face of a woman, the tail of a lion, and the
wings of a bird. To Oedipus the Sphinx pre7 sented its renowned riddle:
“W hat is that which is four-footed, three- footed, and two- footed?”
All who failed to answer correctly were de - stroyed by the Sphinx; and
the terrified Thebans, longing to clear the highway of this monster, had
vowed to have as their next king whoever should solve the riddle, for
the Sphinx had agreed to commit suicide if any- one answered it. Oedipus
replied: “Man; for as a child he crawls on four feet, as an adult he
walks on two, and as an old man he adds a cane.” It was</p>
<p>394 THE LIFE OF GREECE ( CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>a lame answer, but the Sphinx accepted it, and loyally plunged to its
death. The Thebans hailed Oedipus as their savior, and when Laius failed
to return they made the newcomer king. Obeying the custom of the land,
Oedipus married the queen, and had by her four children: Antigone,
Polynices, Eteocles, and Ismene. In the second scene in Sophocles’ play—
the most powerful scene in Greek drama — an old high priest, commanded
by Oedi- pus to reveal, if he can, the identity of Laius’ murderer,
names Oedipus himself. Nothing could be more tragic than the King’s
reluctant and ter - rified realization that he is the slayer of his
father and the mate of his mother. Jocasta refuses to belieVe it, and
explains it away as a Freudian dream: “It has been the lot of many men
in dreams,” she reassures Oedi - pus, “to think themselves partners of
their mother’s bed; but he passes through life most easily to whom these
things become trifles.”” When the identification is complete she hangs
herself; and Oedipus, mad with remorse, gouges out his own eyes, and
leaves Thebes as an exile, with only Antigone to help him.</p>
<p>In Oedipus at Colonus, the second play of an unintentional
trilogy,*</p>
<p>the former king Is a white- haired outcast leaning upon his
daughter’s arm and begging his bread from town to town. He comes in his
wandering to shady Colonus, and Sophocles takes the opportunity to sing
to his native village, and its faithful olive groves, an untranslatable
song which ranks high in Greek poetry:</p>
<p>Stranger, where thy feet now rest</p>
<p>In this land of horse and rider.</p>
<p>Here is earth all earth excelling.</p>

<p>’Tis a plant that flourishes unsubdued,</p>

<p>In youth so rash or in age so wise.</p>
<p>For the orb of Zeus in heaven surveys it.</p>
<p>And blue- grey light of Athena’s eyes.“</p>
<p>An oracle has foretold that Oedipus will die in the precincts of the
Eu- menides; and when he learns that he is now in their sacred grove at
Colonus the old man, having found no loveliness in life, thinks that
here it would be sweet to die. To Theseus, King of Athens, he speaks
lines that sum up with clairvoyant insight the forces that were
weakening Greece — the decay of the soil, of faith, of morals, and of
men:</p>
<p>Only to gods in heaven</p>
<p>Comes no old age, nor death of anything;</p>
<p>All else is turmoiled by our master Time.</p>
<p>The earth’s strength fades, and manhood’s glory fades,</p>
<p>Faith dies, and unfaith blossoms like a flower.</p>
<p>And who shall find in the open streets of men.</p>
<p>Or secret places of his own heart’s love.</p>
<p>One wind blow true forever?”</p>
<p>Then, seeming to hear the call of a god, Oedipus bids a tender
farewell to Antigone and Ismene, and walks into the dark grove, Theseus
alone ac- companying him.</p>
<p>Going on</p>
<p>A little space we turned. And lo, we saw</p>
<p>The man no more; but he, the King,* was there.</p>
<p>Holding a hand to shade his eyes, as one</p>

<p>What form of death</p>
<p>He died, knows no man but our Theseus only</p>

<p>Without one pang. And so the man was led</p>
<p>With naught to mourn for — did not leave the world</p>
<p>As worn with pain and sickness; but his end,</p>
<p>If any ever was, was wonderfuL®</p>
<p>The last play in the sequence, but apparently the first of the three
to be composed, carries the faithful Antigone to her grave. Hearing that
her brothers Polynices and Eteocles are warring for the kingdom, she
hurries back to Thebes in the hope of bringing peace. But she is
ignored, and the brothers fight to their death. Creon, ally of Eteocles,
seizes the throne, and, as punishment for Polynices’ rebellion, forbids
his burial. Antigone, sharing the Greek belief that the spirit of the
dead is tortured so long as the corpse is not interred, violates the
edict and buries Polynices. Mean- while the chorus sings one of the most
renowned of Sophocles’ odes:</p>
<p>Many wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man.</p>
<p>Over the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan.</p>
<p>Through the foam of the firth man makes his perilous way;</p>
<p>And the eldest of deities. Earth that knows not toil or decay,</p>
<p>Ever he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out.</p>
<p>With breed of the yoked horse the ploughshare tumeth about.</p>
<p>The light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and
the</p>
<p>wood,</p>
<p>He traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.</p>
<p>Master of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart</p>
<p>Who roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;</p>
<p>And the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.</p>
<p>Speech, and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit.</p>
<p>He hath learned for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to
fly,</p>
<p>And the nipping airs that freeze, ’neath the open winter sky.</p>
<p>He hath provision for all; fell plague he hath learned to endure;</p>
<p>Safe whate’er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.®</p>
<p>Antigone is condemned by Creon to be buried alive. Creon’s son Haemon
protests against the awful sentence, and, being repulsed swears to his
father “thou shalt never more set eyes upon my face.” Here for a moment
love plays a part in a Sophoclean tragedy and the poet intones to Eros a
hymn long remembered in antiquity:</p>
<p>Love resistless in fight, all yield at a glance of thine eye;</p>
<p>Love who pillowed all night on a maiden’s cheek doth lie;</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>Over the upland folds thou roamest, and the trackless sea.</p>
<p>Love the gods captive holds; shall mortals not yield to thee?”</p>
<p>Haemon disappears; and in search for him Creon orders his soldiers to
open the cave in which Antigone has been entombed. There they find
Antigone dead and beside her Haemon, resolved to die.</p>
<p>We looked, and in the cavern’s vaulted gloom</p>
<p>I saw the maiden lying strangled there,</p>
<p>A noose of linen twined about her neck;</p>
<p>And hard beside her, clasping her cold form.</p>
<p>Her lover lay bewailing his dead bride . . .</p>
<p>When the King saw him, with a terrible groan</p>
<p>He moved towards him, crying, “O my son.</p>
<p>What hast thou done? What ailed thee? What mischance</p>
<p>Has reft thee of thy reason? Oh, come forth.</p>
<p>Come forth, m y son; thy father supplicates.”</p>
<p>But the son glared at him with tiger eyes.</p>
<p>Spat in his face, and then, without a word.</p>
<p>Drew his two-hilted sword and smote, but</p>
<p>Missed his father flying backwards. Then the boy.</p>
<p>Wroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent,</p>
<p>Fell on his sword and drove it through his side</p>
<p>Home; but, yet breathing, clasped in his lax arms</p>
<p>The maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined</p>
<p>With his expiring gasps. So there they lay</p>
<p>Two corpses, one in death.”</p>
<p>The dominant qualities of these plays, surviving time and
translation, are beauty of style and mastery of technique. Here is the
typically “clas - sic” form of utterance: polished, placid, and serene;
vigorous but restrained, dignified but graceful, with the strength of
Pheidias and the smooth deli- cacy of Praxiteles. Classic too is the
structure; every line is relevant, and moves towards that moment in
which the action finds its climax and its significance. Each of these
plays is built like a temple, wherein every part is carefully finished
in detail, but has its proper and subordinate place in the whole; except
that the Philoctetes lazily accepts the deus ex machma (which is a jest
in Euripides) as a serious solution bf a knotty plot. Here, as in
Aeschylus, the drama moves upward towards the hybrts of some crowning
insolence (as in Oedipus’ bitter curse upon the unknown mur - derer);
turns around some anagnorisis or sudden recognition, some peripeteia or
reversal of fortune; and moves downward toward the nemesis</p>
<p>39^ THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVIi;</p>
<p>of inevitable punishment. Aristotle, when he wished to illustrate
perfection of dramatic structure, always referred to Oedipus the King,
and the two plays that deal with Oedipus illustrate well the
Aristotelian definition of tragedy as a purging of pity and terror
through their objective presentation. The characters are more clearly
drawn than in Aeschylus, though not as realistically as in Euripides. “I
draw men as they ought to be drawn,” said Sophocles, “Euripides draws
them as they are””— as if to say that drama should admit some
idealization, and that art should not be photography. But the influence
of Euripides appears in the argumentativeness of the dialogue and the
occasional exploitation of sentiment; so Oedipus wrangles unroyally with
Teiresias, and, blinded, gropes about touchingly to feel the faces of
his daughters. Aeschylus, contemplating the same situation, would have
forgotten the daughters and thought of some eternal law.</p>
<p>Sophocles, too, is a philosopher and a preacher, but his counsels
rely less than those of Aeschylus upon the sanctions of the gods. The
spirit of the Sophists has touched him, and though he maintains a
prosperous orthodoxy, he reveals himself as one who might have been
Euripides had he not been so fortunate. But he has too much of the
poet’s sensitivity to excuse the suffering that comes so often
undeserved to men. Says Lyllus, over</p>
<p>Heracles’ writhing body:</p>
<p>We are blameless, but confess</p>
<p>That the gods are pitiless.</p>
<p>Children they beget, and claim</p>
<p>Worship in a father’s name.</p>
<p>Yet with apathetic eye</p>
<p>Look upon such agony.”</p>
<p>He makes Jocasta laugh at oracles, though his plays turn upon them
creakingly; Creon denounces the prophets as “all a money - getting
tribe”; and Philoct etes asks the old question, “How justify the ways of
Heaven, finding Heaven unjust?’”* Sophocles answers hopefully that
though the moral order of the world may be too subtle for us to
understand it, it is there, and right will triumph in the end.” Follo
wing Aeschylus, he iden- tifies Zeus with this moral order, and comes
even more closely to mono- theism. Like a good Victorian he is uncertain
of his theology, but strong in his moral faith; the highest wisdom is to
find that law which is Zeus, the moral compass of the world, and follow
it.</p>

<p>Sinless in word and deed,</p>

<p>For only in Olympus is their home,</p>
<p>Nor mortal wisdom gave them birth;</p>
<p>And howsoe’er men may forget,</p>
<p>They will not sleep.”</p>
<p>It is the pen of Sophocles, but the voice of Aeschylus, faith making
the last stand against unbelief. In this piety and resignation we see
the figure of Job repentant and reconciled; but between the lines we
catch premonitions of Euripides.</p>
<p>Like Solon, Sophocles counts that man most blessed who has never been
born, and him next happiest who dies in infancy. A modern pessimist has
taken pleasure in translating the somber lines of the chorus on the
death of Oedipus, lines that reflect a world-weariness brought on by old
age, and the bitter fratricide of the Peloponnesian War:</p>
<p>What man is he that yeameth</p>

<p>Every scholastic gossip knows that Sophocles consoled his old age
with the hetaira Theoris, and had offspring by her.” His legitimate son
lophon, fearing, perhaps, that the poet would bequeath his wealth to
Theoris’ child, brought his father to court on a charge of financial
incompetence. Sophocles read to the jury, as evidence of his mental
clarity, certain cho- ruses from the play which he was writing, probably
the Oedipus at Colonits; whereupon the judges not only acquitted him,
but escorted him to his home.” Bom many years before Euripides, he lived
to put on mourning for him; and then, in that same year 406, he too
died. Legend tells how, as the Spartans besieged Athens, Dionysus, god
of the drama, appeared to Lysander and obtained a safe-conduct for the
friends of Sophocles, who wished to bury him in the sepulcher of his
fathers at Deceleia. The Greeks rendered him divine honors, and the poet
Simmias composed for him a quiet epitaph:</p>
<p>Creep gently, ivy, ever gently creep.</p>
<p>Where Sophocles sleeps on in calm repose;</p>
<p>Thy pale green tresses o’er the marble sweep.</p>
<p>While all around shall bloom the purple rose.</p>
<p>There let the vine with rich full clusters hang.</p>
<p>Its fair young tendrils flung around the stone;</p>

<p>Mozart perfected its form in melodious simplicity, and Beethoven com-
pleted the development in works of unbalanced grandeur; so Aeschylus
cleared the way and set the forms for Greek drama with his harsh verse
and stern philosophy, Sophocles fashioned the art with measured music
and placid wisdom, and Euripides completed the development in works of
passionate feeling and turbulent doubt. Aeschylus was a preacher of
almost Hebraic intensity; Sophocles was a “classic” artist clinging to a

<p>Euripides was born in the year — some say on the day — of Salamis,
prob- ably on the island itself, to which, we are told, his parents had
fled for refuge from the invading Medes.” His father was a man of some
property and prominence in the Attic town of Phyla; his mother was of
noble fam- ily,” though the hostile Aristophanes insists that she kept a
grocer’s shop and hawked fruit and flowers on the street. In later life
he lived on Salamis, loving the solitude of its hills, and its varied
prospects of blue sea. Plato wished to be a dramatist and became a
philosopher; Euripides wished to be a philosopher and became a
dramatist. He “took the entire course of Anaxagoras,” says Strabo;” he
studied for a while with Prodicus, and was so intimate with Socrates
that some suspected the philosopher of having a hand in the poet’s
plays.” The whole Sophistic movement entered into his education, and
through him captured the Dionysian stage. He became the Voltaire of the
Greek Enlightenment, worshiping reason with destruc- tive innuendo in
the midst of dramas staged to celebrate a god.</p>
<p>The records of the Dionysian Theater credit him with seventy-five
plays, from The Daughters of Pelias in 455 to The Bacchae in 406;
eighteen sur- vive, and a medley of fragments from the rest.* Their
subject matter tells again the legends of the early Greeks, but with a
note of skeptical pro- test sounding timidly and then boldly between the
lines. The Ion presents the reputed founder of the Ionian tribes in a
delicate dilemma: the oracle of Apollo declares Xuthus to be his father,
but Ion discovers that he is the son of Apollo, who seduced his mother
and then palmed her off on Xuthus; can it be. Ion asks, that the noble
god is a liar? In Heracles and Alcestis the mighty son of Zeus and
Alcmena is described as a good-natured drunk- ard, with the appetite of
Gargantua and the brains of Louis XVI. The</p>

Alcestis, 438; Medea, 431; Hippolytus, 428; Andromache, 427; Hecuba, ca.
425; Electra, ca. 416; The Trojan Women, 415; Iphtgenta in Tauris, ca.
413; Orestes, 408; Iphigenia in Aulis, 40^^; The Bao chae, 40^.</p>
<p>402 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Alcestis recounts the unprepossessing story of how the gods, as a
condition of allowing further life to Admetus (king of Thessalian
Pherae), required that some other should consent to die in his stead.
His wife offers herself as a sacrifice, and bids him a hundred-line
farewell, which he hears with magnanimous patience. Alcestis is carried
out for dead; but Heracles, be- tween solitary drinking bouts and
banquets, goes forth, argues and brow- beats Death into relinquishing
Alcestis, and brings her back alive. The play can be understood only as
a subtle attempt to make the legend ridicu- lous.*</p>
<p>The Hippolytus applies with more finesse and grace the same method of
reduction to the absurd. The handsome hero is a youthful huntsman who
vows to Artemis, virgin goddess of the chase, that he will always be
faithful to her; will ever shun women, and will find his greatest
pleasure in the woods. Aphrodite, incensed by this insulting celibacy,
pours into the heart of Phaedra, Theseus’ wife, a mad passion for
Hippolytus, Theseus’ son by the Amazon Antiope. Here is the first love
tragedy in extant literature, and here at the outset are all the
symptoms of love at the crisis of its fever: Phaedra, rejected by
Hippolytus, languishes and fades to the point of death. Her nurse,
suddenly become a philosopher, muses with Hamlet- like skepticism about
a life beyond the grave:</p>
<p>Yet all man’s life is but ailing and dim.</p>
<p>And rest upon the earth comes never.</p>
<p>But if any far-off state there be.</p>
<p>Dearer than life to mortality.</p>
<p>The hand of the Dark hath hold thereof.</p>
<p>And mist is under and mist above.</p>
<p>And some are sick for life, and cling</p>
<p>On earth to this nameless and shining thing;</p>
<p>For other life is a fountain sealed.</p>
<p>And the deeps below us are unrevealed.</p>
<p>And we drift on legends forever.“</p>
<p>The nurse bears a message to Hippolytus that Phaedra’s bed will
welcome him; he, knowing that she is his father’s wife, is horrified,
and bursts into one</p>

<li>It was presented in 438 as the fourth play in a group by Euripides;
perhaps it was intended as a half-serious satyr play rather than as a
half- comic tragedy. In Bdaustion’s Advmture Browning, with generous
simplicity, has taken the play at its face value.</li>

<p>Was it thy will to make man, why his birth</p>

<p>Phaedra dies; and in her hand her husband finds a note saying that
Hippo- lytus seduced her. Theseus wildly calls upon Poseidon to slay
Hippolytus. The youth protests his innocence, but is not believed. He is
driven out of the land by Theseus; and as his chariot passes along the
shore a sea lion emerges from the waves and pursues him; his horses run
away, upset the chariot, and drag the entangled Hippolytus (i.e., “torn
by horses”) over the rocks to a mangled death. And the chorus cries out,
in lines that must have startled Athens,</p>
<p>Ye gods that did snare him,</p>
<p>Lo, I cast in your faces</p>
<p>My hate and my scorn!</p>
<p>In the Medea Euripides forgets for a while his war against the gods,
and transforms the story of the Argonauts into his most powerful play.
When Jason reaches Colchis, the royal princess Medea falls in love with
him, helps him to get the Golden Fleece, and, to shield him, deceives
her father and kills her brother. Jason vows eternal love to her, and
takes her back with him to lolcus. There the almost savage Medea poisons
King Pelias to secure the throne that Pelias promised to Jason. Since
the law of Thes- saly forbids him to marry a foreigner, Jason lives with
Medea in unwedded love, and has two children by her. But in time he
tires of her barbarian intensity, looks about him for a legal wife and
heir, and proposes to marry the daughter of Creon, King of Corinth.
Creon accepts him, and exiles Medea. Medea, brooding upon her wrongs,
speaks one of the famous passages of Euripides in defense of woman:</p>
<p>Of all things upon earth that bleed and grow,</p>
<p>A herb most bruised is woman. We must pay</p>
<p>Our store of gold, hoarded for that one day.</p>
<p>To buy us some man’s love; and lo, they bring</p>
<p>A master of our flesh! There comes the sting</p>
<p>Of the whole shame. And then the jeopardy.</p>
<p>For good or ill, what shall that master be. . . .</p>
<p>Home never taught her that — how best to guide</p>
<p>Toward peace the thing that sleepeth at her side.</p>
<p>And she who, laboring long, shall find some way</p>
<p>Whereby her lord may bear with her, nor fray</p>
<p>His yoke too fiercely, blessed is the breath</p>
<p>That woman draws! Else let her pray for death.</p>

<p>(chap, xvn</p>
<p>Her lord, if he be wearied of her face</p>
<p>Within doors, gets him forth; some merrier place</p>
<p>Will ease his heart; but she waits on, her whole</p>
<p>Vision enchained on a single soul.</p>
<p>And then they say ’tis they that face the call</p>
<p>Of war, while we sit sheltered, hid from all</p>
<p>Peril! False mocking! Sooner would I stand</p>
<p>Three times to face their battles, shield in hand.</p>
<p>Than bear one child.“</p>
<p>Then follows the terrible story of her revenge. She sends to her
rival, in pretended reconciliation, a set of costly robes; the
Corinthian princess puts one on, and is consumed in fire; Creon, trying
to rescue her, is burned to death. Medea kills her own children and
drives off with their dead bodies before Jason’s eyes. The chorus chants
a philosophic end;</p>
<p>Great treasure halls hath Zeus in heaven.</p>
<p>From whence to man strange dooms be given.</p>
<p>Past hope or fear.</p>
<p>And the end men looked for cometh not.</p>
<p>And a path is there where no man thought:</p>
<p>So hath it fallen here.</p>
<p>The remaining plays turn for the most part upon the tale of Troy.
In</p>
<p>Helen we get the revised version of Stesichorus and Herodotus:” the
Spar - tan queen does not elope -with Paris to Troy; she is carried
against her will to Egypt, and chastely awaits her master there; all
Greece, Euripides sug- gests, has been hoodwinked by the legend of Helen
in Troy. In Iphigenia in Aults he pours into the old story of
Agamemnon’s sacrifice a profusion of sentiment new to the Greek drama,
and a Lucretian horror of the crimes to which the ancient faith
persuaded men. Aeschylus and Sophocles had also written on this theme,
but their plays were soon forgotten in the brilliance of this new
performance. The arrival of Clytaemnestra and her daughter is visioned
with Euripidean tenderness; Orestes, “yet a wordless babe,” is present
to witness the superstitious murder that will dictate his destiny. The
girl is all shyness and happiness as she runs to greet the King:</p>
<p>Iphig. Fain am I, father, on thy breast to fall.</p>
<p>After so long! Though others I outrun —</p>

<p>When Achilles comes she finds that he knows nothing of their supposed

<p>And sat, thy child, upon thy knees the first;</p>
<p>And we exchanged sweet charities of life.</p>
<p>And this was thy discourse with me — “My child,</p>
<p>Shall I behold thee happy in the home</p>
<p>Of thy liege lord and husband, as befits?”</p>
<p>And nestling in the beard which now I clasp</p>
<p>A suppliant, I made answer unto thee:</p>
<p>“I too will welcome thee, when grey with years,</p>
<p>In the sweet shelter of my home, my Sire,</p>

<p>Clytaemnestra denounces Agamemnon’s surrender to a savage ritual, and
utters a threat that contains many tragedies — “Constrain me not to turn

<p>In the Hecuba the war is over; Troy has been taken, and the victors
are apportioning the spoils. Hecuba, widow of King Priam, sends her
young- est son Polydorus with a treasure of gold to Priam’s friend
Polymn estor, King of Thrace. But Polymnestor, thirsting for the gold,
slays the boy and throws his corpse into the sea; it is cast up on the
shores of Ilion, and is brought to Hecuba. Meanwhile the shade of dead
Achilles holds the winds from blowing the Greek fleet homeward till he
has received in human sacrifice the fairest of Priam’s daughters,
Polyxena. The Greek herald, Talthybius, comes to take the girl from
Hecuba. Finding her</p>
<p>prostrate, disheveled, and distraught who had so recently been a
queen, he utters some lines of Euripidean doubt:</p>
<p>What shall I say, Zeus? — that thou look’st on men?</p>
<p>Or that this fancy false we vainly hold</p>
<p>For naught, who deem there is a race of gods,</p>
<p>While chance controlleth all things among men?“</p>
<p>The next act of the composite drama takes the form of The Trojan</p>
<p>Women. It was produced in 415, shortly after the Athenian destruction
of Melos (416), and almost on the eve of the expedition that aimed to
conquer Sicily for the Athenian Empire. It was at this moment that</p>
<p>Euripides, shocked by the massacre in Melos and by the brutal
imperialism of the proposed attack upon Syracuse, dared to present a
powerful plea for peace, a brave portrayal of victory from the
standpoint of the de- feated, “the greatest denunciation of war in
ancient literature.”” He be - gins where Homer ends — after the capture
of Troy. The Trojans lie dead after a general slaughter, and their
women, bereaved to madness, pass down from their ruined city to be the
concubines of the victors. Hecuba enters with her daughters Andromache
and Cassandra. Polyxena has already been sacrificed, and now Talthybius
comes to lead Cassandra to Aga- memnon’s tent. Hecuba falls to the
ground in grief. Andromache tries to console her, but she too breaks
down, as clasping the little prince Astyanax to her breast, she thinks
of his dead father.</p>

<p>Hecuba, dreaming of some distant revenge, bids Andromache accept her
new master graciously, that he may allow her to rear Astyanax, and that
Astyanax may some day restore the house of Priam and the splendor of
Troy. But the Greeks have thought of this too; and Talthybius comes to
announce that Astyanax must die: “ ’Tis their will thy son from this
crested wall of Troy be dashed to death.” He tears the child from
its</p>
<p>mother’s arms, and Andromache, holding it for a last moment, bids it
an hysterical farewell.</p>

<p>In the Electra the ancient theme is far advanced. Agamemnon is dead,
Orestes is in Phocis, and Electra has been married off by her mother to
a peasant whose simple fidelity, and awe of her royal descent, survive
her brooding negligence of him. To her, wondering will Orestes never
find her, Orestes comes, bidden by Apollo himself (Euripides drives this
point home) to avenge Agamemnon’s death. Electra stirs him on; if he
will not kill the murderers she will. The lad finds Aegisthus and slays
him, and then turns upon his mother. Clytaemnestra is here a subdued and
aging woman, gray-haired and frail, haunted by the memory of her crimes,
at once fearing and loving the children who hate her; asking, but not
beg- ging, for mercy; and half reconciled to the penalty of her sins.
When the lalling is over Orestes is overcome with horror.</p>
<p>Sister, touch her again.</p>

<p>Bear in thy bitter pain,</p>

<p>The final act of the drama, in Euripides, is called Iphigenia in
Teams — i.e., Iphigenia among the Tauri. Artemis, it now appears,
substituted a deer for Agamemnon’s daughter on the pyre at Aulis,
snatched the girl from the flames, and made her a priestess at the
shrine of Artemis among the half-savage Tauri of the Crimea. The Tauri
make it a rule to sacrifice to the goddess any stranger who sets foot
unasked upon their shores; and Iphigenia is the unhappy, brooding
ministrant who consecrates the vic- tims. Eighteen years of separation
from Greece and those she loved have dulled her mind with grief.
Meanwhile the oracle of Apollo has promised Orestes peace if he will
capture from the Tauri the sacred image of</p>
<p>Artemis, and bring it to Attica. Orestes and Pylades set sail, and at
last reach the land of the Tauri, who gladly accept them as gifts of the
sea for Artemis, and hurry them off to be slain at her altar. Orestes,
exhausted, falls in an epileptic fit at Iphig enia’s feet; and though
she does not recog - nize him, she is overwhelmed with pity as she sees
the two comrades, in the fairest years of youth, faced with death.</p>

<p>She promises to save them if they will carry back to Argos the
message which she bids them store in their memories.</p>
<p>Iphig. Say, “To Orestes, Agamemnon’s son.</p>
<p>She that was slain in Aulis, dead to Greece</p>
<p>Yet quick, Iphigeni a, sendeth peace.”</p>
<p>Orestes. Iphigenia! Where? Back from the dead?</p>
<p>Iphig. ’Tis I. But speak not, lest thou break my thread.</p>
<p>“Take me to Argos, brother, ere I die.”</p>
<p>Orestes wishes to clasp her in his arms, but the attendants forbid
it; no man may touch the priestess of Artemis. He declares himself
Orestes, but she cannot believe him. He convinces her by recalling the
tales Oectra told them.</p>
<p>Iphig. Is this the babe I knew.</p>
<p>The little babe, light-lifted like a bird? . . .</p>
<p>0 Argos land, O hearth and holy flame</p>
<p>That old Cyclopes lit,</p>
<p>1 bless ye that he lives, that he is grown,</p>
<p>A light and strength, my brother and mine own;</p>
<p>I bless your name for it.“</p>
<p>They offer to rescue her, and in turn she helps them to capture the
image of Artemis. By her subtle ruse they reach their ship safely, and
carry the statue to Brauron; there Iphigenia becomes a priestess, and
there, after her death, she is worshiped as a deity. Orestes is released
from the Furies, and knows some years of peace. The thirst of the gods
is sated, and the drama of The Children of Tantalus is complete.</p>

<li>The Dramatist</li>
</ol>
<p>We must agree with Aristotle that these plays, from the viewpoint of
dramatic technique, fall short of the standards set by Aeschylus and
Sophocles.* The Medea, the Hippolytus, and The Bacchae are well</p>
<p>planned, but even they cannot compare with the structural integrity
of the Oresteia, or the complex unity of Oedipus the King. Instead of
plunging at once into the action, and explaining its antecedents
gradually and naturally in the course of the story, Euripides employs
the artificial expedient of a pedagogical prologue, and, worse stM, puts
it sometimes into the mouth of a god. Instead of showing us the action
directly, which is the function of drama, he too often introduces a
messenger to describe the action, even</p>
<p>4t2 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>when no violence is involved. Instead of making the chorus a part of
the action he transforms it into a philosophical aside, or uses it to
interrupt the development with lyrics always beautiful, but often
irrelevant. In- stead of presenting ideas through action, he sometimes
displaces action with ideas, and turns the stage into a school for
speculation, rhetoric, and argu- ment. Too often his plots depend upon
coincidences and “recognition”— though these are well arranged and
dramatically presented. Most of the plays (like a few by his
predecessors) end with intervention by the deus ex machina, the god from
the crane — a device that can be forgiven only on the assumption that
for Euripides the real play ended before this theophany, and the god was
let down to provide the orthodox with a virtuous conclusion to what
would otherwise have been a scandalous per- formance.” With such
prologues and ep ilogues the great humanist won the privilege of
presenting his heresies on the stage.</p>
<p>The material, like the form, is a medley of genius and artifice.
Euripides is above all sensitive, as every poet must be; he feels the
problems of man- kind intensely, and expresses them with passion; he is
the most tragic and the most human of all dramatists. But his feeling is
too frequently senti- mentality; his “droppings of warm tears”” are too
easily released; he loses no chance to show a mother parting from her
children, and wrings all possible pathos out of every situation. These
scenes are always moving, and sometimes are described with a power
unequaled in tragedy before or since; but they descend occasionally to
melodrama, and a surfeit of vio- lence and horror, as at the close of
the Medea. Euripides is the Byron and Shelley and Hugo of Greece, a
Romantic Movement in himself.</p>
<p>He easily surpasses his rivals in the delineation of character.
Psychologi- cal analysis replaces with him, even more than with
Sophocles, the opera- tion of destiny; he is never weary of
investigating the morals and motives of human conduct. He studies a
great variety of men, from Electra’s peasant</p>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Philosopher</li>

<p>But it would be foolish to judge Euripides chiefly as a playwright;
his ruling interest is not dramatic technique but philosophical inquiry
and pohtical reform. He is the son of the Sophists, the poet of the
Enlighten- ment, the representative of the radical younger generation
that laughed at the old myths, flirted with socialism, and called for a
new social order in which there should be less exploitation of man by
man, of women by men, and of all by the state. It is for these rebel
souls that Euripides writes; for them he adds his skeptical innuendoes,
and inserts a thousand heresies between the lines of supposedly
religious plays. He covers his tracks with pious passages and patriotic
odes; he presents a sacred myth so literally that its absurdity is
manifest and yet his orthodoxy cannot be impeached; he gives the body of
his plays over to doubt, but surrenders the first and last words to the
gods. His subtlety and brilliance, hke those of the French
Encyclopedists, is due in some part to the compulsion laid upon him to
speak his mind while saving his skin.</p>
<p>His theme is that of Lucretius —</p>
<p>Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum</p>
<p>— so great are the evils to which religion has led men: oracles that
breed violence upon violence, myths that exalt immorality with divine
example, and shed supernatural sanctions upon dishonesty, adultery,
theft, human sacrifice, and war. He describes a soothsayer as “a man who
speaks few truths but many lies”;” he calls it “sheer folly” to chart
the future from the entrails of birds;’” he denounces the whole
apparatus of oracles and divination.*” Above all he resents the immoral
implications of the legends:</p>
<p>Men shall know there is no God, no light</p>
<p>In heaven, if wrong to the end shall conquer right. . . .</p>
<p>Say not there be adulterers in heaven,</p>
<p>Nor prisoner gods and gaolers: long ago</p>
<p>My heart hath named it vile, and shall not alter. . . .</p>
<p>These tales be false, false as those feastings wild</p>
<p>Of Tantalus, and gods that tare a child.</p>
<p>This land of murderers to its gods hath given</p>
<p>Its own lust. Evil dwelleth not in heaven. . . .</p>
<p>All these</p>
<p>Are dead unhappy tales of minstrelsy.”*</p>
<p>Sometimes such passages are softened with hymns to Dionysus, or
psalms</p>

<p>of pantheistic piety; but occasionally a character extends the
Euripidean doubt to all the gods:</p>
<p>Doth some one say that there be gods above?</p>
<p>There are not, no, there are not. Let no fool.</p>
<p>Led by the old false fable, thus deceive you.</p>
<p>Look at the facts themselves, yielding my words</p>
<p>No undue credence; for I say that kings</p>
<p>Kill, rob, break oaths, lay cities waste by fraud.</p>
<p>And doing thus are happier than those</p>
<p>Who live calm pious lives day after day.““</p>
<p>He begins his lost Melanippe with a startling couplet —</p>
<p>0 Zeus, if there be a Zeus,</p>
<p>For I know of hirn only by report —</p>
<p>whereupon the audience, we are told, rose to its feet in protest.

<p>And all their ways, like man’s ways, bu t a stream</p>
<p>Of turmoil. He who cares to suffer least,</p>
<p>Not blind as fools are blinded by a priest.</p>
<p>Goes straight … to what death, those who know him know.“*</p>
<p>The fortunes of men, he thinks, are the result of natural causes, or
of aimless chance; they are not the work of intelligent supernatural
beings.“““ He suggests rational explanations of supposed miracles;
Alcestis, for exam- ple, did not really die, but was sent off to burial
while still alive; Heracles caught up with her before she had time to
die.^“ He does not clearly tell us what his belief is, perhaps because
he feels that the evidence does not lend itself to clear belief; but his
most characteristic expressions are those of the vague pantheism that
was now replacing polytheism among the educated Greeks.</p>

<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 415</p>
<p>Social justice is the minor theme of his songs; like all sympathetic
spirits he longs for a time when the strong will be more chivalrous to
the weak, and there will be an end to misery and strife.™ Even in the
midst of war, with all its compulsion to a patriotic belligerency, he
presents the woes and horrors of war with unsparing realism.</p>
<p>How are ye blind.</p>
<p>Ye treaders down of cities, ye that cast</p>
<p>Temples to desolation, and lay waste</p>
<p>Tombs, the untrodden sanctuaries where lie</p>
<p>The ancient dead; yourselves so soon to die.”*</p>
<p>He gnaws his heart out at the sight of Athenians fighting Spartans
for half a century, each enslaving the other, and both killing off their
best; and he indites in a late play a touching apostrophe to peace:</p>
<p>O Peace, thou givest plenty as from a deep spring; there is no</p>
<p>beauty like unto thine; no, not even among the blessed gods. My</p>
<p>heart yearneth within me, for thou tarriest; I grow old and thou
re-</p>
<p>tumest not. Shall weariness overcome mine eyes before they see</p>
<p>thy bloom and thy comeliness.^ When the lovely songs of the</p>
<p>dancers are heard again, and the thronging feet of them that wear</p>
<p>garlands, shall grey hairs and sorrow have destroyed me utterly?</p>
<p>Return, thou holy one, to our city; abide not far from us, thou</p>
<p>that quencheth wrath. Strife and bitterness shall depart if thou
art</p>
<p>with us; madness and the edge of the sword shall flee from our</p>
<p>doors.”* *</p>
<p>Almost alone among the great writers of his time he dares to attack
slavery; during the Peloponnesian War it became obvious that most slaves
were such not by nature but by the accidents of life. He does not recog-
nize any natural aristocracy; environment rather than heredity makes the
man. The slaves in his dramas play important parts, and often speak his
finest lines. With the imaginative sympathy of a poet he considers
women. He knows the faults of the sex, and exposes them so realistically
that Aristophanes was able to make him out a misogynist; but he did more
than any other playwright of antiquity to present the case for women,
and to support the dawning movement for their emancipation Some of his
plays are almost modern, post-Ibsen studies in the problems of sex, even
of sexual perversion.™ He describes men with realism, but women with
gallantry^ the terrible Medea gets more compassion from him than he
accords to the heroic but unfaithful Jason. He is the first dramatist to
make a play</p>

mouthed by thousands of young Greeks:</p>
<p>0 Love, our Lord, of gods and men the king,</p>
<p>Eidier teach not how beauteous beauty is.</p>
<p>Or help poor lovers, whom like clay thou moldest.</p>
<p>Through toil and labor to a happy end.“</p>
<p>Euripides is naturally a pessimist, for every romantic becomes a
pessimist when reality impinges upon romance. “Life,” said Horace
Walpole, “is a comedy to those who think, a tr agedy to those who
feel.”*“ “Long ago,” says our poet,</p>
<p>1 looked upon man’s days, and found a grey</p>
<p>Shadow. And this thing more I surely say</p>
<p>That those of all men who are counted wise.</p>
<p>Strong wits, devisers of great policies.</p>
<p>Do pay the bitterest toll. Since life began</p>
<p>Hath there in God’s eye stood one happy man.!<em>“</em></p>
<p>He wonders at the greed and cruelty of men, the resourcefulness of
evil, and the obscene indiscriminateness of death. At the beginning of
the Alcestis Death says, “Is it not my function to take the doomed?”— to
which Apollo answers, “No; only to dispatch those who have ripened into
full old age.” When death comes after life has been fully lived it is
natural, and does not offend us. “We should not lament our fate if, like
the harv ests that follow each other in the passage of the years, one
generation of men after another flowers, fades, and is carried off. So
it is ordered in the course of Nature; and we must not be dismayed by
anything that is rendered inevitable by her laws.””* His conclusion is
stoicism: “Do thou endure as men must, chafing not.’”“ Now and then,
following Anaximenes and anticipating the Stoics, he consoles himself
with the thought that the spirit of man is part of the divine Air or
pneuma, and will, after death, be preserved in the Soul of the
World.”*</p>

<p>The man whom we picture from these plays resembles sufficiently the
sitting statue in the Louvre, and the busts at Naples, to let us believe
that these are faithful copies of authentic Greek originals. The bearded
face is handsome, but overwrought with meditation, and softened with a
ten- der melancholy. His friends agreed with his enemies that he was
gloomy, almost morose, not given to conviviality or laughter, and
spending his later years in the seclusion of his island home. He had
three sons, and derived some happiness from their childhood.“ He found
solace in books, and was the first private citizen in Greece, so far as
we know, to collect a sub- stantial library.*“ He had excellent friends,
including Protagoras and Socrates; the latter, who ignored other dramas,
said that to see a play by Euripides he would walk to the Piraeus — a
serious matter for a stout philosopher. The younger generation of
emancipated souls looked up to him as their leader. But he had more
enemies than any other writer in Greek history. The judges, who felt
themselves bound, presumably, to protect rehgion and morals from his
skeptical arrows, crowned only five of his efforts with victory; even so
it was liberal of the archon basileus to admit so many Euripidean plays
to a religious stage. Conservatives in all fields looked upon the
dramatist as responsible with Socrates for the growth of unbelief among
Athenian youth. Aristophanes declared war upon him at the outset in The
Acharnians, satirized him with hilarious cari- cature in The
Thesmophoriazusae, and, in the year after the poet’s death, continued
the attack in The Frogs; nevertheless, we are told, the tragic and the
comic dramatist were on friendly terms to the end.“ As for the audi-
ence, it denounced his heresies and crowded to his plays. When, at line
612 of the Hippolytus, the young hunter said, “My tongue hath sworn, but
my mind remains unbound,” the crowd protested so loudly against what
seemed to be an outrageously immoral proposition that Euripides had to
rise in his seat and comfort them with the assurance that Hippolytus
would suffer edifyingly before the story closed — a safe promise for
almost</p>
<p>any character in Greek tragedy.</p>
<p>» ■ ■</p>
<p>• There had already been royal or state libraries in Greece, as we
have seen; and such collections in Egypt can be traced back to the
Fourth Dynasty. A Greek library consisted of scrolls arranged in
pigeonholes in a chest. Publication meant that an author had allowed his
manuscript to be copied, and the copies to be circulated; thereafter
further copies could be made without permission or “copyright.” Copies
of popular works were numerous, and not costly; Plato tells us in the
Apology that Anaxagor as’ treatise On Nature could be bought for a
drachma (). Athens, in the age of Euripides, became the chief center of
the book trade in Greece.</p>
<p>4i8 the life of Greece (chap. xvn</p>
<p>About 410 he was indicted on a charge of impiety; and soon afterward
Hygiaonon brought against him another suit, involving much of the poet’s
fortune, and adduced Hippolytus’ line as proof of Euripides’ dishonesty.
Both accusations failed; but the wave of public resentment that met The
Trojan Women led Euripides to feel that he had hardly a friend left in
Athens. Even his wife, it is said, turned against him because he could
not join in the martial enthusiasm of the city. In 408, at the age of
seventy- two, he accepted the invitation of King Archelaus to be his
guest in the Macedonian capital. At Pella, under the protection of this
Frederick — who had no fears for the orthodoxy of his people — Euripides
found peace and comfort; there he wrote the almost idyllic Iphigenia in
Aulis, and the pro- found religious play. The Bacchae. Eighteen months
after his arrival he died, attacked and dismembered, said pious Greeks,
by the royal hounds.“”</p>
<p>A year later his son produced the two dramas at the city Dionysia,
and the judges gave them the first prize. Even modern scholars have
thought that The Bacchae was Euripides’ apology to Greek religion;”“ and
yet the play may have been intended as a bitter allegory of Euripides’
treatment by the public of Athens. It is the story of how Pentheus, King
of Thebes, was tom to pieces by a mob of female Dionysian orgiasts, led
by his own mother Agave because he had denounced their wild superstition
and in- truded upon their revelry. It was no invention; the tale
belonged to the religious tradition; the dismemberment and sacrifice of
an animal, or of any man who dared to attend the ceremonies, was part of
the Dionysian rite; and this powerful drama, by returning for its plot
to the legend of Dionysus, bound Greek tragedy at its culmination with
Greek tragedy at its birth. The play was composed among the Macedonian
mountains which it describes in lyrics of unfailing power; and perhaps
it was intended for performance in Pella, where the Bacchic cult was
especially strong. Euripides enters with surprising insight into the
mood of religious ecstasy, and puts into the mouths of the Bacchantes
psalms of passionate devotion; it may indeed be that the old poet had
gone to the Hmits of rationalism and beyond it, and recognized now the
frailty of reason, and the persistency of the emotional needs of women
and men. But the story does dubious honor to the Dionysian religion; its
theme is once more the evils that may come of superstitious creeds.</p>
<p>The god Dionysus visits Thebes in disguise as a Bacchus, or
incarnation of himself, and preaches the worship of Dionysus. The
daughters of Cad- mus reject the message; he hypnotizes them into pious
ecstasy, and they</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 419</p>
<p>go up into the hills to worship him with wild dances. They clothe
them- selves with the skins of animals, girdle themselves with snakes,
crown them- selves with ivy, and suckle the young of wolves and deer.
The Theban king Pentheus opposes the cult as hostile to reason, morals,
and order, and imprisons its preacher, who bears his punishment with
Christian gentle- ness. But the god in the preacher asserts himself,
opens the prison walls, and uses his miraculous power to hypnotize the
young ruler. Under this influence Pentheus dresses himself as a woman,
climbs the hills, and joins the revelers. The women discover that he is
a man, and tear him limb from limb; his own mother, drunk with
“possession,” carries Pentheus’ severed head in her hands, thinking it
the head of a lion, and sings a song of triumph over it. When she comes
to her senses and sees that it is the head of her son, she is revolted
with the cult that intoxicated her; and when Dionysus says, “Ye mocked
me, being God; this is your wage,” she answers, “Should God be like a
proud man in his rage?” The last les son is the same as the first; even
in his dying play the poet remained Euripides.</p>
<p>After his death he achieved popularity even in Athens. The ideas for
which he had fought became the dominant conceptions of the following
centuries, and the Hellenistic age looked back to him and to Socrates as
the greatest intellectual stimuli that Greece had ever known. He had
dealt with living problems rather than “dead tales of minstrelsy,” and
it took the ancient world a long time to forget him. The plays of his
prede- cessors slipped into oblivion while his own were repeated in
every year, and wherever the Greek world had a stage. When, in the
collapse of that expedition to Syracuse (415) whose failure had been
forecast in The Trojan Women, the captive Athenians faced a living death
as chained slaves in the quarries of Sicily, those were given their
freedom (Plutarch tells us) who could recite passages from the plays of
Euripides.““ The New Comedy molded itself upon his dramas, and grew out
of them; one of its leaders, Philemon, said, “If I were sure that the
dead have consciousness, I would hang myself to see Euripides.’”“ The
revival of skepticism, liberalism, and humanitarianism in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries made Euripides almost a contemporary figure,
more modem than Shakespeare. All in all, only Shakespeare has equaled
him; and Goethe did not think so. “Have all the nations of the world
since Euripides,” asked Goethe of Eckermann, “produced one dramatist
worthy to hand him his slippers?’““ Not more than one.</p>

<li>ARISTOPHANES</li>
</ol>
<p>1 . Aristophanes and the War</p>
<p>Greek tragedy is more somber than the Elizabethan, because it seldom
employs that principle of comic relief by which, through a humorous
interruption of the tragical, the auditor’s tolerance for tragedy is
increased. The Greek playwright preferred to keep his tragic drama on a
persistently high plane, and relegated comedy to a “satyr” play which
carried no seri - ous import, but allowed the excited emotions of the
audience to subside into humor and ease. In the course of time the comic
drama declared its inde- pendence of tragedy, and a day was allotted to
it, at the Dionysian festivals, when the entire program consisted of
three or four comedies, written by different authors, played in
succession, and competing for a separate prize.</p>
<p>Comedy, like oratory, had its first Greek bloom in Sicily. About
484</p>
<p>there came to Syracuse from Cos a philosopher, physician, poet, and
drama- tist, Epicharmus, who expounded Pythagoras, Heracleitus, and
rationalism in thirty-five comedies, of which only occasional quotations
remain. Twelve years after Epicharmus’ arrival in Sicily the Athenian
archon allowed its first chorus to comedy. The new art developed rapidly
under the stimulus of democracy and freedom, and became the principal
medium, in Athens, of moral and political satire. The wide license of
speech permitted to comedy was a tradition of the Dionysian phallic
procession. The abuse of this freedom led in 440 to a law against
personal attacks in comedy; but this prohibition was repealed three
years later, and full freedom of criticism and abuse continued even
during the Peloponnesian War. The Greek comedy took the place, as
political critic, of a free press in modern democ- racies.</p>
<p>We hear of many comic dramatists before Aristophanes, and the great
Rabelais of antiquity even condescended to praise some of them when the
smoke of his battles with them had cleared away. Cratinus was the
mouthpiece of Cimon, and made rabid war against Pericles, whom he called
“the squill - headed God Almighty”;’” merciful time has spared us the
necessity of reading him. Another forerunner was Pherecrates, who, about
420, satirized, in The Wild Men, those Athenians who professed to
dislike civilization and to long for a “return to nature”: so old are
the brave innovations of our youth. The ablest competitor of
Aristophanes was Eupolis; they at first co-operated, then quarreled and
parted, after which they satirized each other vigorously, but still
agreed in attacking the demo-</p>
<p>CHAP.XVn) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 421</p>
<p>cratic party. If comedy throughout the fifth century was hostile to
democ- racy, it was partly because poets like money and the aristocracy
was rich, but chiefly because the function of Greek comedy was to amuse
with criticism, and the democratic party was in power. Since the leader
of the democracy, Pericles, was sympathetic to new ideas like the
emancipation of woman and the development of a rationalist philosophy,
the comic dramatists ranged themselves, with suspidous unanimity,
against all forms of radicalism, and called for a return to the ways and
reputed morals of the “Men of Marathon.” Aristophanes became th e voice
of this reaction, as Socrates and Euripides were the protagonists of the
new ideas. The con- flict between religion and philosophy captured the
comic stage.</p>
<p>Aristophanes had some excuse for liking aristocracy, since he came of
a cultured and prosperous family, and appears to have owned land in
Aegina. His very name was a patent of nobility, meaning “the best made
manifest.” Bom about 450, he was in the springtime of fife when Athens
and Sparta began that war which was to be a bitter theme of his plays.
The Spartan invasion of Attica compelled him to abandon his country
estate and come to live in Athens. He disliked city life, and resented
the sudden demand upon him to hate Megarians, Corinthians, and Spar-
tans; he denounced this conflict of Greek killing Greek, and called, in
play after play, for peace.</p>
<p>After the death of Pericles in 429 supreme power in Athens passed
into the hands of the rich tanner, Cleon, who represented those
commercial interests that wanted a “knock - out blow”— i.e., the utter
destruction of Sparta as a competitor for the mastery of Greece. In a
lost play, The Babylonians (426), Aristophanes subjected Cleon and his
policies to such stinging ridicule that the burly strategos prosecuted
him for treason, and had him fined. Two years later Aristophanes
revenged himself by pre- senting The Knights. Its leading character was
Demos (i.e., the People), whose major-domo was called the Tanner;
everyone understood the trans- parent allegory, including Cleon, who saw
the play. The satire was so sharp that no actor would play the part of
the Tanner for fear of political misfortune, whereupon Aristophanes took
the role himself. Nicias (the name of the superstitious leader of the
oligarchic faction) announces that an o racle has told him that the next
ruler of Demos’ house will be a sausage - seller. Such a huckster comes
along, and the slaves hail him as “Chief that shall be of our glorious
Athens!” “Prithee,” says the Sausage - Seller, “let me go wash my tripes
. . . y ou make a fool of me.” But one Demosthenes assures him that he
has just the qualifications for ruling the people — is he</p>
<p>422 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>not a rascal, and free from all education? The Tanner, fearing that
he is to be deposed, protests his services and his loyalty to Demos; no
one ex- cept the harlots, he urges, has done so much for Demos as he.
There is the usual Aristophanic burlesque: the Sausage-Seller belabors
the Tanner with tripe, and primes himself for an oratorical contest in
the Assembly by eating garlic. A contest in adulation ensues, to see
which of the can- didates can praise Demos the more lavishly, and
“deserve better of Demos and his belly.” The rivals bring a feast of
good things and lay them before Demos like a platter of pre-election
promises. The Sausage-Seller proposes that as a test of their honesty
each candidate’s locker shall be searched. In the Tanner’s locker a heap
of succulent dainties is found, in particular a massive cake, from which
he has cut only a tiny slice for Demos (a refer- ence to a current
charge that Cleon had embezzled state funds). The Tan- ner is dismissed,
and the Sausage- Seller becomes the ruler of Demos’ house.</p>
<p>The Wasps (422) continues the satire on democracy in a milder and</p>
<p>weaker vein; the chorus is composed of idle citizens — dressed as
wasps — who seek to make an obol or two every day by serving as jurymen,
in order that they may, by listening to “sycophants” and levying
confiscatory fines, vote the money of the rich into the coffers of the
state and the pockets of the poor. But Aristophanes’ ruling interest in
these early plays is to ridicule war and promote peace. The hero of The
Achamians (425) is Diceopolis (“Honest Citizen”), a farmer who complains
that his land has been devastated by armies, so that he can no longer
live by squeezing wine from his vineyards. He sees no reason for war,
and is clear that he him- self has no quarrel with the Spartans. Tired
of waiting for the generals or the politicians to make peace, he signs a
personal treaty with the Lace- daemonians; and when a chorus of
war-patriotic neighbors denounces him he replies:</p>
<p>Well, the very Spartans even. I’ve my doubts and scruples whether</p>
<p>They’ve been totally to blame, in every instance, a ltogether.</p>
<p>Chorus. Not to blame in every instance? Villain, vagabond, how</p>
<p>dare ye.</p>
<p>Talking treason to our faces, to suppose that we will spare ye?</p>
<p>He agrees to let them kill him if he cannot prove that Athens is as
much to blame for the war as Sparta. His head is laid upon a chopping
block, and he begins his argument. Presently an Athenian general enters,
defeated, blustering, and profane; the Chorus is disgusted with him, and
releases DiceopolK, who pleases all by selling a wine called Peace. It
was a play</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 423</p>
<p>of considerable audacity, possible only among a people trained to
hear the other side. Taking advantage of the parabasis or digression in
which the custom of comedy allowed the aiithor to address the audience
through the chorus or one of the characters, Aristophanes explained his
function as a comic gadfly among the Athenians:</p>
<p>Never since our poet presented comedies has he praised himself</p>
<p>upon the stage. . . . But he maintains that he has done you much that
is good. If you no longer allow yourselves to be too much hood-</p>
<p>winked by strangers or seduced by flattery, if in politics you
are</p>
<p>no longer the ninnies you once were, it is thanks to him.
Formerly,</p>
<p>when delegates from other cities wanted to deceive you, they had</p>
<p>but to style you “the people crowned with violets”; at the word</p>
<p>“violets” you at once sat erect on the tips of your bums. Or if,
to</p>
<p>tickle your vanity, some one spoke of “rich and sleek Athens,” he</p>
<p>would get all, because he spoke of you as he would have of anchovies
in oil. In cautioning you against such wiles, the poet has done you</p>
<p>great service.^*</p>
<p>In The Peace (42 1 ) the poet was triumphant: Cleon was dead, and
Nicias was about to sign for Athens a treaty pledging peace and
friendship with Sparta for fifty years. But a few years later
hostilities were resumed; and in 41 1 Aristophanes, abandoning hope in
his fellow citizens, invited the women of Greece to end the bloodshed.
As the Lysistrata opens, the ladies of Athens, while their men are still
asleep, gather at dawn in council near the Acropolis. They agree to
withhold the comforts of love from their spouses until these come to
terms with the enemy; and they send an em- bassy to the women of Sparta
to invite their co-operation in this novel campaign for peace. The men,
awake at last, call to the women to come home; when these refuse, the
men besiege them, but the attackers are repulsed with pails of hot water
and torrents of speech. Lysistrata (“Dis - solver of Armies”) reads the
men a lesson:</p>
<p>During the wars of old we bore with you. . . . But we observed</p>
<p>you carefully; and oftentimes, when we were at home, we used to</p>
<p>hear that you had decided some matter badly. When we inquired</p>
<p>about it, the men w ould answer, “What’s that to you? Be silent.”</p>
<p>And we asked, “How is it, husband, that you men manage these</p>
<p>affairs so foolishly?”</p>
<p>The leader of the men answers that women must keep out of public
matters because they cannot manage the treasury. (As they debate, some
of tht women steal away to their husbands, muttering Aristophanic
excuses.)</p>

<p>2 . Aristophanes and the Radicals</p>
<p>Behind the disintegration of Athenian public life, in the view of
Aris- tophanes, lay two basic evils: democracy and irreligion. He agreed
with Socrates that the sovereignty of the people had become a
sovereignty of politicians; but he was convinced that the skepticism of
Socrates, Anaxag- oras, and the Sophists had helped to loosen those
moral bonds which had once made for social order and personal integrity.
In The Clouds he</p>
<p>made uproarious fun of the new philosophy. An old-fashioned gentleman
by the name of Strepsiades, who is looking for an argument that may jus-
tify him in repudiating his debts, is delighted to hear that Socrates
operates a Thinking Shop where one may learn to prove anything, even if
it is false. He finds his way to the “School of Very Hard Thinkers.” In
the middle of the classroom he sees Socrates suspended from the ceiling
in a basket, engrossed in thought, while some of the students are bent
down with noses to the ground.</p>

<p>In another scene Pheidippides, son of Strepsiades, meets in
personifica- tion Just Argument and Unjust Argument. The first tells him
that he</p>
<p>must imitate the stoic virtues of the men of Marathon, but the other
preaches to him the new morality. What good, asks Unjust Argument, have
men ever gained by justice, or virtue, or moderation? For one hon- est
successful and respected man there can always be found ten dishonest
successful and respected men. Consider the gods themselves: they lied,
stole, murdered, and committed adultery; and they are worshiped by all
the Greeks. When Just Argument doubts that most successful men have been
dishonest. Unjust Argument asks him:</p>

father, on the ground that he is strong enough to do it and enjoys it;
and besides, he asks, “Did you not beat me when I was a boy?” Strepsiad

Zeus no longer exists, having been replaced by Vortex. The enraged
father runs out into the streets, and calls upon all good citizens to

<p>philosophy. They attack and bum down the Thinking Shop, and Socrates
barely escapes with his life.</p>
<p>We do not know what part this comedy played in the tragedy of</p>
<p>Socrates. It was brought out in 423, twenty-four years before the
famous trial. Its good-humored satire does not seem to have offended the
philoso- pher; we are told that he stood throughout the performance, to
give his enemies a better shot. Plato pictures Socrates and Aristophanes
as friends after the performance; Plato himself recommended the play to
Dionysius I of Syracuse as a jolly extravaganza, and maintained his own
friendship with Aristophanes even after his master’s death.“® Of the
three accusers of Socrates in 399 one, Meletus, was a child when the
comedy was pre- sented, and another Anytus, was on friendly terms with
Socrates after the play.““ Probably the later circulation of the play as
literature did the sage more harm than its original performance;
Socrates himself, in Plato’s re - port of his defense, referred to the
play as one of the major sources of that bad reputation which was
prejudicing his case with the jurors.</p>
<p>There was another target in Athens at which Aristophanes aimed his
satire; and in this case the mood was one of implacable hostility. He
dis- trusted the skepticisms of the Sophists, the moral, economic, and
political individualism that was undermining the state, the sentimental
feminism that was agitating the women, and the socialism that was
arousing the slaves. All these evils he saw at their clearest in
Euripides; and he resolved to destroy with laughter the influence of the
great dramatist upon the mind of Greece.</p>
<p>He began in 41 1 with a play which he called The Thesmophoriazusae^
from the women who celebrated in sexual exclusiveness the feast of Deme-
ter and Persephone. The assembled devotees discuss the latest quips of
Euripides against their sex, and plan revenge. Euripides gets wind of
the proceedings, and persuades his father-in-law Mnesilochus to dress as
a woman and enter the meeting to defend him. The first complainant
alleges that the tragic dramatist has deprived her of a living:
fo’rmerly she made wreaths for the temples, but since Euripides has
shown that there are no gods, the temple business has been ruined.
Mnesilochus defends Euripides on the ground that his worst sayings about
women are visibly and audibly true, and are mild compared with what
women themselves know to be their faults. The ladies suspect that this
traducer of the sex cannot be a woman; they tear off Mnesilochus’
disguise, and he saves himself from dismemberment only by snatching a
babe from a woman’s arms and</p>
<p>CHAP.XVn) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 427</p>
<p>threatening to kill it if they touch him. As they nevertheless attack
him, he unwraps the child, and finds that it is a wineskin disguised to
escape the collector of internal revenue. He proposes to cut its throat
just the same, much to the distress of its owner. “Spare my darling!”
she cries; “or at least bring a bowl, and i f it must die, let us catch
its blood.” Mnesilochus solves the problem by drinking the wine, and
meanwhile sending an appeal to Euripides for rescue. Euripides appears
in various parts from his plays — now as Menelaus, now as Perseus, now
as Echo — and finally arranges Mnesilochus’ escape.</p>
<p>The Frogs (405) returns to the assault despite Euripides’ death.
Diony - sus, god of the drama, is dissatisfied with the surviving
playwrights of Athens, and descends to Hades to bring back Euripides. As
he is ferried over to the lower world a choir of frogs greets him with a
croaking chorus that must have provided a month’s catchword for young
Athenians. Aris - tophanes pokes much fun at Dionysus in passing, and
boldly parodies the Mysteries of Eleusis. When the god arrives in Hades
he finds Euripides attempting to unseat Aeschylus as king of all
dramatists. Aeschylus accuses Euripides of spreading skepticism and a
dangerous casuistry, and of cor- rupting the morals of Athenian women
and youth; ladies of refinement, he says, have been known to kill
themselves through shame at having heard Euripides’ obscenities. A pair
of scales is brought in, and each poet throws into it lines from his
plays; one mighty phrase of Aeschylus (here the satire strikes the older
poet too) tips the scale against a dozen of Euripides. At last Aeschylus
proposes that the younger dramatist shall leap into one scale with wife,
children, and baggage, while he will guarantee to find a couplet that
will outweigh them all. In the end the great skeptic loses the contest,
and Aeschylus is brought back to Athens as victor.* This oldest known
essay in literary criticism received the first prize from the judges,
and so pleased the audience that another performance of it was given a
few days afterward.</p>
<p>In a middling play called The Ecclesiazusae (393) — i.e.. The
Assembly- women — Aristophanes turned his laughter upon the radical
movement in general. The ladies of Athens disguise themselves as men,
pack the Assem- bly, outvote their husbands, brothers, and sons, and
elect themselves rulers of the state. Their leader is a fiery
suffragette, Praxagora, who berates her sex as fools for letting
themselves be ruled by such dolts as men, and pro- poses that all wealth
shall be divided equally among the citizens, leaving the slaves
uncontaminated with gold. The attack upon Utopia takes a</p>

<p>more graceful form in Aristophanes’ masterpiece, Th e Birds (414).
Two citizens who despair of Athens climb up to the abode of the birds,
hoping to find there an ideal life. With the help of the birds they
build, between earth and heaven, a Utopian city, Nephelococcygia, or
Cloud-Cuckoo- Land. The birds, in a chorus as lyrically perfect as
anything in the tragic poets, apostrophize mankind:</p>
<p>Ye children of man, whose life is a span.</p>
<p>Protracted with sorrow from day to day,</p>
<p>Naked and featherless, feeble and querulous.</p>
<p>Sickly calamitous creatures of clay,</p>
<p>Attend to the words of the sovereign birds,</p>
<p>Immortal, illustrious lords of the air.</p>
<p>Who survey from on high, with a merciful eye.</p>
<p>Your struggles of misery, labor, and care.</p>
<p>The birds plan to intercept all communication between the gods and
men; no sacrifices shall be allowed to mount to heaven; soon, say the
reformers, the old gods will starve, and the birds will be supreme. New
gods are in- vented in the image of birds, and those conceived in the
image of men are deposed. Finally an embassy comes from Olympus, seeking
a truce; the leader of the birds agrees to take as his wife the
handmaiden of Zeus, and the play ends in a happy marriage.</p>
<p>3 . The Artist and the Thinker</p>
<p>Aristophanes is an unclassifiable mixture of beauty, wisdom, and
filth. When the mood is upon him he can write lyrics of purest Greek
serene, which no translator has ever yet conveyed. His dialogue is life
itself, or perhaps it is swifter, racier, more vigorous than life dares
be. He belongs with Rabelais, Shakespeare, and Dickens in the lusty
vitality of his style; and like theirs his characters give us more
keenly the shape and aroma of the time than all the works of the
historians; no one who has not read Aristophanes can know the Athenians.
His plots are ridiculous, and are put together with an almost extempore
carelessness; sometimes the main theme is exhausted before the play is
half through, and the remainder limps forward on the crutches of
burlesque. The humor is generally of a low order; it cracks and groans
with facile puns, drags itself out to tragic lengths, and too often
depends upon digestion, reproduction, and excre- tion. In The Achamians
we hear of a character who eases himself con-</p>

<p>tinuously for eight months;“* m The Clouds the major forms of human
waste are mingled with sublime philosophy;<em>” every second page offers
us rumps, wind, bosoms, gonads, coitus, pederasty, onanism; everything
is here.</em>” He charges his old rival, Cratinus, with nocturnal
incontinence.*” He is the most contemporary of ancient poets, for
nothing is so timeless as obscenity. Coming to him after any other Greek
author — worst of all, after Euripides — he seems depressingly vulgar,
and we find it difficult to imagine the same audience enjoying them
both.</p>
<p>If we are good conservatives we can stomach all this on the
ground</p>
<p>that Aristophanes attacks every form of radicalism, and upholds
devotedly every ancient virtue and vice. He is the most immoral of all
Greek writers known to us, but he hopes to make up for it by attacking
immorality. He is always found on the side of the rich, but he denounces
cowardice; he lies pitilessly about Euripides, living and dead, but he
assails dishonesty; he describes the women of Athens as unbelievably
coarse, but he exposes Euripides for defaming them; he burlesques the
gods so boldly* that in comparison with the pious Socrates we must
picture him as an hilarious atheist — but he is all for religion, and
accuses the philosophers of under- mining the gods. Yet it took real
courage to caricature the powerful Cleon, and to paint the faults of
Demos to Demos’ face; it took insight to see, in the trend of religion
and morals from sophistic skepticism to epicurean individualism, a basic
danger to the life of Athens. Perhaps Athens would have fared better if
it had taken some of his advice, moderated her im- perialism, made an
early peace with Sparta, and mitigated with aristocratic leadership the
chaos and corruption of post-Periclean democracy.</p>
<p>Aristophanes failed because he did not take his own counsels
seriously enough to observe them himself. His excesses of pornography
and abuse were partly responsible for the law forbidding personal
satire; and though the law was soon repealed, the Old Comedy of
political criticism died before the death of Aristophanes (385), and was
replaced, even in his later plays, by the Middle Comedy of manners and
romance. But the vitality of the Greek comic theater ^appeared along
with its extravagance and brutality. Philemon and Menander rose and
passed and were forgotten, while Aristophanes survived all changes of
moral and literary fashions to come down to our own time with eleven of
his forty-two plays intact. Even today, despite all difficulties of
understanding and translation, Aris- tophanes is alive; and, if we hold
our noses, we can read him with profane delight.</p>

<li>THE HISTORIANS</li>
</ol>
<p>Prose was not completely forgotten in this heyday of dramatic poetry.
Oratory, stimulated by democracy and litigation, became one of the pas-
sions of Greece. As early as 466 Corax of Syracuse wrote a treatise,
Techne Logon (The Art of Words), to guide the citizen who wished to
address an assembly or a jury; here already are the traditional
divisions of an ora- tion into introduction, narrative, argument,
subsidiary remarks, and perora- tion. Gorgias brought the art to Athens,
and Antiphon used the ornate style of Gorgias in speeches and pamphlets
devoted to oligarchical propa- ganda. In Lysias Greek oratory became
more natural and vivid; but it was only in the greatest statesmen, like
Themistocles and Pericles, that the pub- lic address rose above all
visible artifice, and proved the effectiveness of simple speech. The new
weapon was sharpened by the Sophists, and so thoroughly exploited by
their pupils that when the oligarchic party seized power in 404 it
forbade the further teaching of rhetoric.“*</p>
<p>The great achievement of Periclean prose was history. In a sense it
was the fifth century that discovered the past, and consciously sought
for a perspective of man in time. In Herodotus historiography has all
the charm and vigor of youth; in Thucydides fifty years later, it has
already reached a degree of maturity which no later age has ever
surpassed. What separates and distinguishes these two historians is the
Sophist philosophy. Herodotus was the simpler, perhaps the kindlier,
certainly the more cheerful spirit. He was bom in Halicarnassus about
484, of a family exalted enough to participate in political intrigue;
because of his uncle’s adventures he was exiled at the age of
thirty-two, and began those far-reaching travels that supplied the
background for his Histories. He passed down through Phoe- nicia to
Egypt, as far south as Elephantine; he moved west to Gyrene, east to
Susa, and north to the Greek cities on the Black Sea. Wherever he went
he observed and inquired with the eye of a scientist and the curiosity
of a child; and when, about 447, he settled down in Athens, he was armed
with a rich assortment of notes concerning the geography, history, and
man- ners of the Mediterranean states. With these notes, and a little
plagiarizing of Hecataeus and other predecessors, he composed the most
famous of all historical works, recording the life and history of Egypt,
the Near East, and Greece from their legendary origins to the close of
the Persian War. An ancient story tells how he read parts of his book
publicly at Athens and Olympia, and so pleased the Athenians with his
account of the war.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 43I</p>
<p>and their exploits in it, that they voted him twelve talents (0,000)
— which any historian will consider too pleasant to be true.*”</p>
<p>The introduction announces the purpose of the book in grand
style:</p>
<p>This is a presentation of the Inquiries {HistoricA) of Herodotus</p>
<p>of Halicarnassus, to the end that time may not obliterate the
great</p>
<p>and marvelous deeds of the Hellenes and the Barbarians; and espe-
cially that the causes for which they waged war with one another</p>
<p>may not be forgotten.</p>
<p>Since all the nations of the eastern Mediterranean are brought into
the narrative, the b ook is, in a limited sense, a “universal history,”
much broader in its scope than the narrow subject of Thucydides. The
story is uncon- sciously unified by the contrast of barbarian despotism
with Greek democ- racy, and moves, though by halting steps and confusing
digressions, to a foreshadowed and epic end at Salamis. The purpose is
to record “wondrous deeds and wars,””* and in truth the tale sometimes
recalls Gibbon’s regret - table misunderstanding of history as “little
more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of
mankind.’”” Nevertheless Herodotus, though he speaks in only the most
incidental way of literature, science, philosophy, and art, finds room
for a thousand interesting illustrations of the dress, manners, morals,
and beliefs of the societies he describes. He tells us how Egyptian cats
jump into the fire, how the Danubians get drunk on smells, how the walls
of Babylon were built, how the Massagetae eat their parents, and how the
priestess of Athena at Pedasus grew a mighty beard. He presents not only
kings and queens, but men of all degrees; and women, who are excluded
from Thucydides, enliven these pages with their scandals, their beauty,
their cruelties, and their charm.</p>
<p>There is, as Strabo says, “much nonsense in Herodotus”;”* but our his
- torian, like Aristotle, covers a vast field, and has many
opportunities to err. His ignorance is as wide as his learning, his
credulity is as great as his wis - dom. He thinks that the semen of
Ethiopians is black,”’ acce pts the legend that the Lacedaemonians won
battles because they had brought the bones of Orestes to Sparta,“* and
reports incredible figures for the size of Xerxes’ army, the casualties
of the Persians, and the almost woundless victories of the Greeks. His
account is patriotic, but not unjust; he gives both sides of most
political disputes,* signalizes the heroism of the invaders, and tes-
tifies to the honor and chivalry of the Persians. When he depends
upon</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>foreign informants he makes his greatest mistakes; so he thinks that
Nebuchadrezzar was a woman, that the Alps are a river, and that Cheops
came after Rameses III. But when he deals with matters that he has had a
chance to observe in person he is more reliable, and his statements are
increasingly confirmed as our knowledge grows.</p>
<p>He swallows many superstitions, records many miracles, quotes oracles
piously, and darkens his pages with omens and auguries; he gives the
dates of Semele, Dionysus, and Heracles; and presents all history, like
a Greek Bossuet, as the drama of a Divine Providence rewarding the
virtues and punishing the sins, crimes, and insolent prosperity of men.
But he has his rationalistic moments, perhaps having heard the Sophists
in his later years: he suggests that Homer and Hesiod gave name and form
to the Olympian deities, that custom determines men’s faiths, and that
one man knows as much as another about the gods;’“ having accepted
Providence as the final arbiter of history, he puts it aside, and looks
for natural causes; he com- pares and identifies the myths of Dionysus
and Osiris in the manner of a scientist; he smiles tolerantly at some
tales of divine intervention, and offers a possible natural
explanation;’“ and he reveals his general method with a twinkle in his
eye when he says: “I am under obligation to tell what is re - ported,
but I am not obliged to believe it; and let this hold for every nar-
rative in this history.’”“ He is the first Greek historian whose works
have come down to us; and in that sense Cicero may be forgiven for
calling him the Father of History. Lucian, like most of the ancients,
ranked him above Thucydides.“*</p>
<p>Nevertheless the difference between the mind of Herodotus and that of
Thucydides is almost the difference between adolescence and maturity.
Thucydides is one of the phenomena of the Greek Enlightenment, a
descendant of the Sophists as Gibbon was a spiritual nephew of Bayle and
Voltaire. His father was a rich Athenian who owned gold mines in Thrace;
his mother was a Thracian of distinguished family. He received all the
education available in Athens, and grew up in the odor of skepticism.
When the Peloponnesian War broke out he kept a record of it from day to
day. In 430 he suffered from the plague. In 424, aged thirty-six (or
forty), he was chosen one of two generals to command a naval expedition
to TTirace. Because he failed to lead his forces to Amphipolis in time
to relieve it from siege, he was exiled by the Athenians. He spent the
next twenty years of his life in travel, especially in the Peloponnesus;
to this direct acquaint- ance with the enemy we owe something of the
impressive impartiality</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 433</p>
<p>that distinguishes his book. The oligarchic revolution of 404 ended
his exile, and he returned to Athens. He died — some say by murder — in
or before 396, leaving unfinished his History of the Peloponnesian
War.</p>
<p>He begins it simply:</p>
<p>Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between</p>
<p>the Peloponnesians and the Athenians from the moment that it</p>
<p>broke out, believing that it would be an important war, and more</p>
<p>worthy of relation than any that had preceded it.</p>
<p>He opens his introductory narrative where Herodotus left off, at the
close of the Persian War. It is a pity that the genius of the greatest
Greek historians saw nothing worthier of relation in Greek life than its
wars. Herodotus wrote partly with an eye to entertain the educated
reader; Thucydides writes to furnish information for future historians,
and the guidance of precedent for future statesmanship. Herodotus wrote
in a loose and easygoing style, inspired perhaps by the rambling epics
of Homer; Thucydides, like one who has heard the philosophers, the
orators, and the dramatists, writes in a style often involved and
obscure because it attempts to be at once brief, precise, and profound,
a style occasionally spoiled by Gorgian rhetoric and embellishment, but
sometimes as terse and vivid as Tacitus, and rising, in the more crucial
moments, to a dramatic power as intense as anything in Euripides;
nothing in the dramatists can surpass the pages that describe the
expedition to Syracuse, the vacillations of Nicias, and the horrors that
followed his defeat. Herodotus ranged from place to place and from age
to age; Thucydides forces his story into a rigid chronological frame of
seasons and years, sacrificing the continuity of his narrative.
Herodotus wrote in terms of personalities rather than processes, feeling
that processes operate through personalities; Thucydides, though he
recognizes the role of exceptional individuals in history, and occasion-
ally lightens his theme with a portrait of Pericles or Alcibiades or
Nicias, leans rather to impersonal recording and the consideration of
causes, de- velopments, and results. Herodotus wrote of far-off events
reported to him in most cases at second or third hand; Thucydides speaks
often as an eyewitness, or as one who has spoken with eyewitnesses, or
has seen the original documents; in several instances he gives the
documents concerned. He has a keen conscience for accuracy; even his
geography has been veri- fied in detail. He seldom passes moralistic
judgments upon men or events; he lets his patrician scorn of Athenian
democracy get the better of him in picturing Cleon, but for the greater
part he keeps himself aloof from his</p>
<p>434 ^he life of GREECE (cHAP. zvn</p>
<p>story, gives the facts with fairness to both sides, and recounts the
story of Thucydides’ brief military career as if he had never known,
much less been, the man. He is the father of scientific method in
history, and is proud of the care and industry with which he has worked.
“On the whole,” he says, with a glance at Herodotus,</p>
<p>the conclusions I have drawn from the proofs quoted may, I believe,
be safely relied on. Assuredly they will not be disturbed either by</p>
<p>the lays of a poet displaying the exaggeration of his craft, or
by</p>
<p>the compositions of the chroniclers that are attractive at
truth’s</p>
<p>expense — the subjects they treat being out of the reach of evidence,
and time having robbed most of them of historical value by en-</p>
<p>throning them in the region of legend. Turning from these, we</p>
<p>can rest satisfied with having proceeded upon the clearest data,</p>
<p>and having arrived at conclusions as exact as can be expected in</p>
<p>matters of such antiquity. . . . The absence of romance in my
his-</p>
<p>tory will, I fear, detract somewhat from its interest; but if it
be</p>
<p>judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact knowledge of</p>
<p>the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future — which, in
the course of human affairs, must resemble, if it does not reflect,
the</p>
<p>past — I shall be content. In fine, I have written my work not as
an</p>
<p>essay which is to win the applause of the moment, but as a possession
for all time.“’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he yields accuracy to interest in one particular: he
has a passion for putting elegant speeches into the mouths of his
characters. He frankly admits that these orations are mostly imaginary,
but they help him to explain and vivify personalities, ideas, and
events. He claims that each speech represents the substance of an
address actually given at the time; if this is true, all Greek statesmen
and generals must have studied rhetoric with Gorgias, philosophy with
the Sophists, and ethics with Thrasy- machus. The speeches have all the
same style, the same subtlety, the same realism of view; they make the
laconic Laconian as windy as any Sophist- bred Athenian. They put the
most undiplomatic arguments into the mouths of diplomats,* and the most
compromising honesty into the words of gen- erals. The “Funeral Oration”
of Pericles is an excellent essay on the virtues of Athens, and comes
with fine grace from the pen of an exile; but Peri- cles was famous for
simplicity of speech rather than for rhetoric; and Plutarch spoils the
romance by saying that Pericles left nothing written, and that of his
sayings hardly anything was preserved.”®</p>
<p>the speech of Alcibiades at Sparta, vi, 20.89.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE LITERATURE OF THE GOLDEN AGE 435</p>
<p>Thucydides has defects corresponding to his virtues. He is as severe
as a Thracian, and lacks the vivacity and wit of the Athenian spirit;
there is no humor in his book. He is so absorbed in “this war, of which
Thucydides is the historian” (a proudly recurring phrase) that he has an
eye only for political and military events. He fills his pages with
martial details, but makes no mention of any artist, or any work of art.
He seeks causes sedu- lously, but seldom sinks beneath political to
economic factors in the de- termination of events. Though writing for
future generations, he tells us nothing of the constitutions of the
Greek states, nothing of the life of the cities, nothing of the
institutions of society. He is as exclusive towards women as towards the
gods; he will not have them in his story; and he makes the gallant
Pericles, who risked his career for a courtesan advocate of feminine
freedom, say that “a woman’s best fame is to be as seldom as possible
mentioned by men, either for censure or for praise.’”“ Face to face</p>
<p>We are grateful for him, nevertheless, and must not complain too much
that he did not write what he did not undertake to write. Here at least
is an historical method, a reverence for truth, an acuteness of
observation, an impartiality of judgment, a passing splendor of language
and fascination of style, a mind both sharp and profound, whose ruthless
realism is a tonic to our naturally romantic souls. Here are no legends,
no myths, and no miracles. He accepts the heroic tales, but tries to
explain them in natural- istic terms. As for the gods, he is
devastatingly silent; they have no place in his history. He is sarcastic
about oracles and their safe ambiguity,*“ and scornfully exposes the
stupidity of Nicias in relying upon oracles rather than knowledge. He
recognizes no guiding Providence, no divine plan, not even “progress”;
he sees life and history as a tragedy at once sordid and noble, redeemed
now and then by great men, but always relapsing into superstition and
war. In him the conflict between religion and philosophy is decided; and
philosophy wins.</p>
<p>Plutarch and Athenaeus refer to hundreds of Greek historians. Nearly
all of them but Herodotus and Thucydides, in the Golden Age, have been
covered up by the silt of time; and of the later historians only
paragraphs remain. The case is no different with the other forms of
Greek literature. Of the hundreds of tragic dramatists who won prizes at
the Dionysia, we</p>
<p>43&lt;5 THE LIFE OF GREECE . (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>have a few plays by three; of the many comic writers we have one; of
the great philosophers we have two. All in all, not more than
one-twentieth survives from the critically acclaimed literature of
fifth-century Greece; and from the earlier and later centuries even
less.“* Most of what we have comes from Athens; the other cities, as we
can tell from the philosophers that they sent to Athens, were fertile in
genius too, but their culture was sooner engulfed by barbarism from
without and from below, and their manuscripts were lost in the disorder
of revolution and war. We must judge the whole from the fragments of a
part.</p>
<p>Even so it is a rich heritage, if not in quantity (but who has
absorbed it all?), surely in form. Form and order are the essence of the
classic style in literature as well as in art: the typical Greek writer,
like the Greek artist, is never satisfied with mere expression, but
longs to give .form and beauty to his material. He cuts his matter down
to brevity, rearranges it into clar- ity, transforms it into a complex
simplicity; he is always direct, and seldom obscure; he shuns
exaggeration and bias, and even when he is romantic in feeling he
struggles to be logical in thought. This persistent effort to sub-
ordinate fancy to reason is the dominant quality of the Greek mind, even
of Greek poetry. Therefore Greek literature is “modem,” or rather con -
temporary; we find it hard to understand Dante or Milton, but Euripides
and Thucydides are kin to us mentally, and belong to our age. And that
is because, though myths may differ, reason remains the same, and the
life of reason makes brothers of its lovers in all times, and
everywhere.</p>
