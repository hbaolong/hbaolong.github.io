<p>The Summons to Reason</p>
<p>1558-1649</p>
<p>I. SUPERSTITION</p>
<p>ARE people poor because they are ignorant, or ignorant because they
,ZjL are poor? It is a question that divides political philosophers
between conservatives stressing heredity (inborn inequalities of mental
capacity) and reformers relying on environment (the power of education
and op- portunity). In societies knowledge grows, and superstition
wanes, with the increase and distribution of wealth. And yet even in a
widely prosperous country — and especially among the harassed poor and
the idle rich — thought has to live in a jungle of superstitions:
astrology, numerology, palmistry, portents, the evil eye, witches,
goblins, ghosts, demons, in- cantations, exorcisms, dream
interpretations, oracles, miracles, quackery, and occult qualities,
curative or injurious, in minerals, plants, and animals. Consider, then,
the intellectual miasma poisoning the roots and wilting the flowers of
science in a people whose wealth is scant or centered in a few. To the
poor in body and mind superstition is a treasured element in the poetry
of life, gilding dull days with exciting marvels, and redeeming misery
with magic powers and mystic hopes.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne, in 1646, required 652 pages to list and briefly
treat the superstitions current in his day.^ Nearly all these occultisms
flourished among the Britons under Elizabeth and the early Stuarts. In
1597 King James VI published an authoritative Demonologie, which is one
of the horrors of literature. He ascribed to witches the power to haunt
houses, to make men and women love or hate, to transfer disease from one
person to another, to kill by roasting a wax effigy, and to raise
devastating storms; and he advocated the death penalty for all witches
and magicians, and even for their customers.* When a tempest nearly
wrecked him on his return from Denmark with his bride, he caused four
suspects to be tortured into confessing that they had plotted to destroy
him by magic means; and one of them, John Fain, after the most barbarous
torments, was burned to death (1590).®</p>
<p>In this matter the Kirk agreed with the King, and lay magistrates
lenient to witches were threatened with excommunication.^ Between 1560
and 1600 some eight thousand women were burned as witches in a
Scotland</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>having hardly a million souls.® In England the belief in witchcraft
was almost universal; learned physicians like William Harvey and Sir
Thomas Browne shared it; the hardheaded Elizabeth allowed her laws of
1562 to make witchcraft a capital crime; eighty-one women were executed
for it in her reign.® James moderated his fanaticism after passing from
VI to I; he insisted on fair trials of the accused, exposed false
confessions and ac- cusations, and saved the lives of five women charged
by a hysterical boy.’^ The hunt nearly ceased after Charles I, but it
was resumed, and reached its height, under the rule of the Long
Parliament, when in two years (1645-</p>
<ol start="47" type="1">
<li>two hundred “witches” were consumed.®</li>
</ol>
<p>One voice, amid the fury, appealed to reason. Reginald Scot, an
English- man despite his name, published at London in 1584 The
Discouerie of Witchcraft, second only to Johann Wier’s De praestigiis
daemormm (Basel,</p>
<ol start="1564" type="1">
<li>in the dangerous attempt to moderate the sadistic superstition. Scot
described the “witches” as poor old women who could harm no one; even if
Satan did work through them they were rather to be pitied than to be
burned; and to ascribe miracles to these crones was an insult to the
miracles of Christ. He exposed the awful tortures that made witchcraft
confessions worthless, the lax irregularity and injustice of trial
procedure, the incredi- bilities gulped down by judges and inquisitors.
The book had no effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this atmosphere science tried to grow.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SCIENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, the expansion of commerce and industry were compelling
the development of science. The Platonic and artistic strains in the
Renais- sance hardly harmonized with the swelling economy; the demand
grew for a mental procedure that would deal with facts and quantities as
well as with theories and ideas; the Aristotelian empiricism revived,
shorn of its Alexandrian and medieval masks. The emphasis of Italian
humanism on the glories of ancient literature and art made way for a
less ethereal stress on current practical needs. Men had to count and
calculate, measure and design, with competitive accuracy and speed; they
needed tools of obser- vation and recording; demands arose which were
met by the invention of logarithms, analytical geometry, calculus,
machines, the microscope, the telescope, statistical methods,
navigational guides, and astronomical in- struments. Throughout Western
Europe lives were henceforth dedicated to meeting these needs.</p>
<p>In 1614 John Napier in Scotland and in 1620 Joost Biirgi in
Switzerland independently proposed a system of logarithms (i.e., a logic
of numbers) by which products, quotients, and roots could be quickly
calculated from</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VH</p>
<p>the tabulated relation of the given numbers as powers of a fixed
number used as a base. Henry Briggs (1616) modified the method for
common computation by proposing 10 as a base, and published tables
giving the logarithms of all numbers from one to 20,000. Now two numbers
could be multiplied by finding, in such tables, the number whose “log”
was the sum of the logs of the numbers to be multiplied; and a could be
divided by b by finding the number whose log was the log of b subtracted
from the log of a. William Oughtred (1622) and Edmund Gunter (1624) con-
structed slide rules by which the results of logarithmic calculations
could be read in a few seconds. These inventions halved the time given
to arithmetical work by mathematicians, astronomers, statisticians,
navigators, and engineers, and in effect lengthened their lives.®
Kepler, who used the new method in computing planetary motions,
addressed an enthusiastic panegyric to the Laird of Merchiston (1620),
not knowing that Napier was then three years dead. Napier himself had
made a little miscalculation, having figured that the world would come
to an end between 1688 and</p>
<p>1700.^®</p>
<p>Mathematicians and astronomers were still closely allied, for the
reckon- ing of celestial motions, the charting of the calendar, and the
guidance of navigation required complex manipulations of astronomic
measurements. As a mathematician, Thomas Harriot established the
standard form of modern algebra, introduced the signs for root, “greater
than” and “less than,” replaced clumsy capitals with small letters to
indicate numbers, and hit upon the beneficent trick of placing all the
quantities in an equation on one side and zero on the other. As an
astronomer, he discovered the spots on the sun, and his observations of
Jupiter’s satellites were made independently of Galileo’s. George
Chapman, himself a monster o f learn- ing, thought Harriot’s knowledge
to be “incomparable and bottomless.”^^</p>
<p>Astronomy was still dripping with astrology. “Horary” astrology de
-</p>
<p>cided whether the stars favored the enterprise of the hour;
“judicial” astrol - ogy foretold affairs in general, usually with
judicious ambiguity; “naruial” astrology disclosed the destiny of an
individual from his horoscope — an examination of the position of the
stars at the moment of his birth; all these</p>
<p>are found in Shakespeare (though not proving his belief) , and in our
time. The moon, in astrological theory, produced tides, tears, madmen,
and thieves (cf. Shakespeare, / Henry IV, I, ii, 15), and each sign of
the</p>
<p>zodiac controlled the character and fate of specific organs in the
human anatomy (Twelfth Night, I, iii, 146-51). John Dee symbolized the
time by mingling astrology, magic, mathematics, and geography: he
engaged in crystal gazing, wrote a Treatise of the Rosie Cruceap
Secrets, was charged with practicing sorcery against Queen Mary Tudor
(1555), drew up geographical and hydrographical charts for Elizabeth,
proposed a</p>

<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>northwest passage to China, invented the phrase “the British Empire,”
lec - tured on Euclid before large audiences in Paris, defended the
Copemican theory, advocated the adoption of the Gregorian calendar (170
years before England resigned itself to such a papistical contraption),
and died at eighty-one; here was a full life! His pupil, Thomas Digges,
promoted the acceptance of the Copemican hypothesis in England, and
anticipated Bruno’s notion of an infinite universe.^^ Thomas and his
father, Leonard</p>
<p>Meanwhile the study of terrestrial magnetism was also preparing for
Newton. In 1544 Georg Hartmann, a German clergyman, and in 1576 Robert
Norman, an English compass maker, independently discovered the tendency
of the magnetic needle, when freely suspended at its center of gravity,
to “dip” from a horizontal position to one at an angle to</p>
<p>the earth’s surface. Norman’s book. The Newe Attractive (1581), sug -
gested that the “joynt Respective” to which the needle dipped lay within
the earth.^®</p>
<p>This fascinating lead was followed by William Gilbert, physician
to</p>
<p>Elizabeth. After seventeen years of research and experiment —
financed by his inherited fortune, and sometimes watched by the Queen —
he set forth his results in the first great book of English science, De
magnete . . . et de magno magnete tellure (i6oo) — On the Magnet . . .
and the Great Magnet the Earth. He laid a pivoted compass needle
successively at different points upon a globular lodestone, he marked
with lines on the globe the directions in which the needle successively
set, he prolonged each line to form a great circle around the stone, and
he found that all these circles crossed at two diametrically opposite
points on the globe; these were the magnetic poles, which, in the case
of the earth, Gilbert mistakenly identified with the geographical poles.
He described the earth as an enormous magnet, explained thereby the
behavior of the magnetic needle, and showed that any iron bar left for a
long time in a north-and- south position would become magnetized. A
magnet placed at either pole of the globular lodestone took a position
vertical to the globe; placed at any point midway between the poles
(such points constituting the magnetic equator), the magnet lay
horizontal. Gilbert concluded that the dip</p>
<p>of the needle would be greater the nearer it was placed to the
geographical</p>
<p>l66 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>poles of the earth; and though this was not quite correct, it was
approxi- mately confirmed by Henry Hudson in his exploration of the
Arctic in</p>
<ol start="1608" type="1">
<li>From his own observations Gilbert drew up directions for cal-
culating latitude from the degree of the magnetic dip. He suggested that
“from about a magnetic body the virtue magnetical is poured out on every
side”; he ascribed the rotation of the earth to the influence of this
magnetic field. Passing on to the study of electricity — ^wherein little
had been done since antiquity — ^he proved that many other substances
besides amber could, when rubbed, generate frictional electricity; and
from the Greek for amber he formed the word electric to denote a power
to deflect a magnetic needle. He believed that all heavenly bodies are
endowed with magnetism; Kepler was to use this idea to explain the
motion of the planets. Most of Gilbert’s work was an admirable example
of experimental pro - cedure, and its effects on science and industry
were immeasurable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The advance of science appeared more dramatically in the efforts of
adventurous or acquisitive spirits to explore the “great magnet” for</p>
<p>geographical or commercial purposes. In 1576 Sir Humphrey Gilbert (no
kin to William) published a suggestive Discourse . . . for a New Passage
to Cataia — ^i.e., “(Cathay,” or China — proposing a northwest sailing
through or around Canada. Sir Martin Frobisher, in that year, set out
with three small vessels to find such a route. One of his ships
foundered, another deserted; he went ahead in the tiny twenty-five-ton
Gabriel; he reached Baffin Land, but the Elskimos fought him, and he
returned to England for more men and supplies. His later voyages were
diverted from geography by a vain hunt for gold. Gilbert took up the
quest for a northwest passage, but was drowned in the attempt (1583).
Four years later John Davys pushed through the strait now named for him;
then he fought the Armada, went off to the South Seas with Thomas
Cavendish, discovered the Falk- land Islands, and was killed by Japanese
pirates near Singapore (1605). Cavendish explored southern South
America, accomplished the third cir- cumnavigation of the globe, and
died at sea (1592). Henry Hudson navi- gated the Hudson River (1609),
and, in another voyage, reached Hudson Bay; but his crew, maddened with
hardships and longing for home,</p>
<p>mutinied and set him adrift, with eight others, in a small open
boat</p>
<p>(1611); they were never heard of again. William Baffin explored the
bay and the island that bear his name, ventured as far north as 77° 45’
— a lati- tude not reached again for 236 years — and had the further
distinction of first finding longitude by observation of the moon.
Richard Hakluyt</p>
<p>saw in such ships and hearts of oak an epic of courage and terror
surpassing any Iliad, and he gathered their narratives into successive
volumes, the best- known of which are those published as The Principal
Navigations, Voy- ages, and Discoveries of the English Nation (1589,
1598-1600); Sam- uel Purchas expanded the record in Hakluytus Posthumus,
or Purchas his</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>Pilgrimes (1625). So, by the greed for gold or trade, and the zest
for far-off peril and scenes, geography unwittingly grew.</p>
<p>The best work of this age in physics, chemistry, and biology was done
on the Continent; in England, however. Sir Kenelm Digby discovered the
necessity of oxygen to plant life, and Robert Fludd, mystic and medico,
advocated vaccination 150 years before Jenner. Medical prescriptions
con- tinued to rely on their repulsiveness for their effect; the
official London pharmacopoeia of 1618 recommended bile, blood, claws,
cockscomb, fur, sweat, saliva, scorpions, snakeskin, wood lice, and
spider web as medi- caments; and bloodletting was a first resort.^^
Nevertheless this period boasts of Thomas Parr (“old Parr”), who was
presented to Charles I in 1635</p>
<p>as still in good health at the alleged age of 152. Parr did not
profess to know his exact age, but his parish authorities dated his
birth in 1483; he claimed to have joined the army in 1500, and he
recalled in detail the dis- solution of the monasteries by Henry VIII
(1536). “You have lived longer than other men,” said Charles I. “What
have you done more than they?” Parr replied that he had fertilized a
wench when he was over a hundred years old and had done public penance
for it. He had subsisted almost entirely on potatoes, greens, coarse
bread, and buttermilk, with rarely a taste of meat. For a while he
became a lion in London parlors and pubs, and he was so handsomely
feasted that he died within a year of meeting the King. Sir William
Harvey performed a post-mortem on him, found him free of
arteriosclerosis, and diagnosed his death as due to change of air and
food.^®</p>
<p>It was Harvey who provided the scientific climax of the age by
ex-</p>
<p>plaining the circulation of the blood — “the most momentous event in
medical history since Galen’s time.”^® Bom at Folkstone in 1578, he
studied at Cambridge, then at Padua under Fabrizio d’Acquapendente.
Returning, he settled down to medical practice in London, and became
personal phy- sician to James I and Charles I. Through patient years he
carried on experi- ments and dissections on animals and cadavers, and
particularly studied the flow and the course of blood in wounds. He came
to his main theory in 1615,*^ but belatedly published it at Frankfurt in
1628 as a modest Ex- ercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis in
animalibus — the first and greatest classic in English medicine.</p>
<p>The steps to his discovery illustrate the internationalism of
science. For over a thousand years the functions of heart and blood had
been inter- preted as by Galen in the second century a.d. Galen had
supposed that blood flowed to the tissues from the liver as well as the
heart; that air passed from the lungs to the heart; that the arteries
and veins carried twin streams of blood, which were propelled and
received by the heart in tides of ebb and flow; and that blood passed
from the right to the left side of the heart through pores in the septum
between the ventricles.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>1 68</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1506) questioned the view that air passed from
lungs to heart; Vesalius (1543) denied the existence of pores in the
septum, and his masterly sketches of arteries and veins revealed their
terminals as so minute and neighborly as almost to suggest passage and
circulation; Fab- rizio showed that valves in the veins made it
impossible for venous blood to flow from the heart. The Galenic theory
faded away. In 1553 Michael Servetus, and in 1558 Realdo Colombo,
discovered the pulmonary circu- lation of the blood — ^its passage from
the right chamber of the heart through the pulmonary artery to and
through the lungs, its purification there by aeration, and its return
via the pulmonary vein to the left chamber of the heart. Andrea
Cesalpino (c. 1571) tentatively — as we shall see — anticipated the full
theory of circulation. Harvey’s work turned the theory into a
demonstrated fact.</p>
<p>While Francis Bacon, his patient, was extolling induction, Harvey
pro- ceeded to his illuminating conclusion by a striking combination of
deduc- tion and induction. Estimating the amount of blood pressed out of
the heart by each systole, or contraction, to be one half a fluid ounce,
he calculated that in half an hour the heart would pour into the
arteries over 500 fluid ounces — a larger quantity than the entire body
contained. Where did all this blood come from? It seemed impossible that
so great a quantity should be produced, hour after hour, from the
digestion of food. Harvey concluded that the blood pumped out of the
heart was returned to it, and that there was no other apparent avenue
for this but the veins. By simple experiments and observations — as by
pressing a finger upon some superficial vein — it was readily shown that
venous blood flowed away from the tissues and toward the heart.</p>
<p>When I surveyed my mass of evidence, whether derived from</p>
<p>vivisections and my previous reflections on them, or from the
ven-</p>
<p>tricles of the heart and the vessels that enter into and issue
from</p>
<p>them . . . and frequently and seriously bethought me . . . what might
be the quantity of blood which was transmitted . . . and not finding</p>
<p>it possible that this could be supplied by the juices of the
ingested</p>
<p>aliment without the veins on the one hand becoming drained, and</p>
<p>the arteries on the other getting ruptured through the excessive</p>
<p>charge of blood, unless the blood should somehow find its way from
the arteries into the veins, and so return to the right side of the
heart; when, I say, I surveyed all this evidence, I began to think
whether</p>
<p>there might not be a motion as it ’were in a circle . . . And now
I</p>
<p>may be allowed to give my view of the circulation of the blood.^®</p>
<p>He had long hesitated to publish his conclusions, knowing the
con-</p>
<p>servatism of the medical profession of his time. He predicted that
no</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>one over forty years of age would accept his theory.^® “I have heard
him say,” reported Aubrey, “that after his book of the Circulation of
the</p>
<p>Blood came out, he fell mightily in his practice, and ’twas believed
by the vulgar that he was crack- brained.”®® Not until Malpighi in 1660
dem - onstrated the existence of capillaries conveying blood from the
arteries to the veins did the learned world concede the circulation to
be a fact. The new view illuminated almost every field of physiology,
and affected the old problem of the interrelation between body and mind.
Said Harvey;</p>
<p>Every affection of the mind that is attended with either pain or</p>
<p>pleasure, hope or fear, is the cause of an agitation whose
influence</p>
<p>extends to the heart … In almost every affection 〔emotion〕 . . .
the</p>
<p>countenance changes, and the blood appears to course hither and</p>
<p>thither. In anger the eyes are fiery and the pupils contracted;
in</p>
<p>modesty the cheeks are suffused with blushes … in lust how</p>
<p>quickly is the member distended with blood!</p>
<p>Harvey continued to serve Charles I almost to the latter’s bitter
end. He accompanied Charles when revolution drove the King from London,
was with him at the battle of Edgehill, and narrowly escaped death.®®
Meanwhile the rebels sacked his London house and destroyed his manu-
scripts and anatomical collections. Perhaps he had made a variety of
enemies by his sharp temper and views. He rated man as “but a great
mischievous baboon,” says Aubrey, and thought that “we Europeans
knew</p>

have already noted his birth and lineage, his education in letters,
diplomacy, and law, his unexpected poverty, his unheard pleas for
office, his futile cautioning and reluctant prosecution of his
beneficent, guilty friend. Learn-</p>
<p>lyo THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. VH</p>
<p>ing and ambition so consumed him that he had no lust left for women;
he had, however, a liking for young men.®^ Finally, at forty-five
(1606), he married Alice Barnham, who brought him ;^2 2o a year. But he
gave no “hostages to fortune” — he had no children.</p>
<p>On the accession of James I, Bacon, in a letter of adulation profuse
in the manner of the time, suggested himself to the King as fit and due
for a governmental post. Son of a Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, nephew
or cousin to the Cecils, he felt that his long wait for office reflected
some hostility on the part of the commanding ministers; and perhaps his
im- patient opportunism was an effect as well as a cause of his tardy
admis- sion to place. He had already served in Parliament for nineteen
years, usually defending the government, and winning repute for wide
learning, constructive thought, and clear and striking speech.
Periodically he sent to the King “memories” eloquent with prudent
advice: how t o improve mutual understanding and co-operation between
Commons and Lords, to unite the parliaments of England and Scotland, to
end persecution for reli- gious diversity, to pacify Ireland by
conciliating its Catholics, to give</p>
<p>greater freedom to Catholics in England without opening the door to
papal claims, and to find a compromise between Anglicans and Puritans.
“To carry out this program,” in the judgment of the historian who has
most thoroughly studied the politics of this period, “would have been to
avert the evils of the next half- century.”*® James put the proposals
aside as impracticable in the current state of opinion, and contented
himself with including Bacon in the three hundred knighthoods that he
distributed in</p>
<ol start="1603" type="1">
<li>Sir Francis still cooled his heels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless his skill as a lawyer slowly raised him to affluence. By
1607 he estimated his wealth at 24, 155.*® On his luxurious estate at
Gorham- bury, manned with select and expensive servants and alert
secretaries like Thomas Hobbes, he could enjoy the beauty and comfort
that he loved wisely but too well. He nursed his health by gardening,
and built amid his gardens a costly retreat for his scholastic privacy.
He wrote like a philos- opher and lived like a prince. He saw no reason
why reason should be pen- niless, or why Solomon should not be king.</p>
<p>He did not fall far short. In 1607 James, valuing him at last, made
him solicitor general; in 1613, attorney general; in 1616, a member of
the Privy Council; in 1617, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in 1618,
Chancellor. New dignities were added to grace his powers: in 1618 he was
created first Baron Verulam; in January 1621, Viscount St. Albans. When
James went to Scotland he left his Chancellor to rule England. Bacon
“gave</p>
<p>audience in great state to ambassadors,” and lived in such splendor
at Gorhambury that it “seemed as if the court was there, and not in
White - hall or St. James.”*^</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>All was won save honor. In the pursuit of place Bacon had repeatedly
sacrificed principle. As attorney general he used his influence to
secure judicial verdicts desired by the King.<em>® As Keeper of the Seal
he defended and protected the most oppressive monopolies, apparently to
keep the good will of Buckingham. As judge he accepted substantial
presents from persons suing in his court. All this was in the loose
custom of the age: public officials were poorly paid, and they
recompensed themselves with “gifts” from those whom they aided; James
confessed, “If I were … to punish those who take bribes, I should soon
not have a single subject left”; and James himself took
bribes.</em>®</p>
<p>The Parliament that assembled in January 1621 was in angry revolt</p>
<p>against the King. It hated Bacon as James’s best advocate, who had
ruled that monopolies were legal. If it could not yet depose the King it
could impeach his minister. In February it named a committee to inquire
into the courts of justice. In March the committee reported that it had
found many irregularities, especially in the conduct of the Lord
Chancellor. Twenty-three specific cases of corruption were charged
against him. He appealed to the King to save him, predicting tha t
“those who now strike at the Chancellor will soon strike at the
Crown.”®® James advised him to acknowledge the charge and so set an
example deterrent to further venality in office. On April 22 Bacon sent
in his confession to the House of Lords. He admitted taking gifts from
litigants, as other judges did; he denied that his decisions had been
thereby influenced — in several cases he had ruled against the giver.
The Lords condemned him “to pay a fine of</p>
<p>40,000; to be imprisoned in the Tower du ring the King’s pleasure; to
be forever incapable to holding any public office … in the Common-
wealth; never to sit in Parliament nor come within the verge of the
Court.” He was taken to the Tower on May 31, but was released within
four days by order of the Kling, who also remitted the ruinous fine. The
chas- tened Chancellor retired to Gorhambury and tried to live more
simply. In cipher, on a paper left by Bacon at his death, his first
biographer, Rawley, found the famous statement, “I was the ju stest
judge that was in England these fifty years. But it was the justest
censure in Parliament that was these 200 years.”®^</p>
<p>The effects of the impeachment were good. It lessened corruption in
office, especially in the courts; and it set a precedent for the
responsibility of the King’s ministers to Parliament. It turned Francis
Bacon back from politics, where he had been a liberal in views and a
reactionary in practice, to his alternative pursuit of science and
philosophy, where he would “ring the bell that called the wits
together,” and would proclaim, in majestic prose, the revolt and program
of reason.</p>

<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GREAT RENEWAL</li>
</ol>
<p>Philosophy had long been his refuge from affairs, if not his secret
love and happiest aptitude. He had already, in 1603-5, published a noble
work. The Proficience and Advancement of Learning, but that seemed to
him rather a prospectus than a performance. In 1609 he had written to
the Bishop of Ely, “If God give me leave to write a just and perfect
volume of philosophy . . and in 1610 to Casaubon, “To bring about the
better ordering of man’s life … by the help of sound and true
contemplations — this is the thing I aim at.”*®</p>
<p>During those harassed years of office he had conceived — ^with a rash
assumption of abundant days — a magisterial plan for the renovation of
science and philosophy. Seven months before his fall he announced the
plan in a Latin work addressed to all Europe, boldly entitled
Instauratio Magna (The Great Renewal). The title page itself was a
challenge; it</p>
<p>showed a vessel passing full sail through the Pillars of Hercules
into the Atlantic; and where a medieval motto had set between those
pillars the warning “Ne plus ultra’’’ (〔Go〕 no farther beyond). Bacon
wrote,</p>
<p>“Multi pertransibunt, et augebitur scientia“ (Many will pass through,
and knowledge will be increased). The proud proemium added, “Francis of
Verulam reasoned thus with himself, and judged it to be for the interest
of the present and future generations that they should be made
acquainted with his thoughts.”®^</p>
<p>Finding that “in what is now done in the matter of science there
is</p>
<p>only a whirling round about, and perpetual agitation, ending where it
begins,” he concluded that</p>
<p>there was but one course left … to try the whole thing anew upon</p>
<p>a better plan, and to commence a total reconstruction of
sciences,</p>
<ul>
<li>practical〕 arts, and all human knowledge, raised upon the
proper</li>
</ul>
<p>foundation; . . . Moreover, because he knew not how long it might</p>
<p>be before these things would occur to any one else … he resolved</p>
<p>to publish at once so much as he had been able to complete . . . that
in case of his death there might remain some outline and project of that
which he had conceived … All other ambition seemed poor in</p>
<p>his eyes compared with the work which he had in hand.®®</p>
<p>He dedicated the entire project to James I, with apologies for
“having stolen from your affairs so much time as was required for this
work,” but hoping that the result would “go to the memory of your name
and the honor of your age” — and it did. James was a man of considerable
learn- ing and good will; if he could be persuaded to finance the plan,
what</p>
<p>CHAP. Vll)</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>»73</p>
<p>progress might not be made? As Roger Bacon, far back in 1268, had
sent to Pope Clement IV his Opus majus seeking aid for a proposed
expansion of knowledge, so now his namesake appealed to his sovereign to
undertake, as a “royal work,” the organization of scientific research
and the philo - sophical unification of the results for the material and
moral benefit of man- kind. He reminded James of the “philosopher kings”
— ^Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius — who had
given good government to the Roman Empire for a century (a.d. 96-180).
Was it because of his need and hope for state funds that he had
consistently and ruinously supported the King?</p>
<p>A further preface asked the reader to look upon current science
as</p>
<p>porous with error and shamefully stagnant, for</p>
<p>the greatest wits in each successive age have been forced out of
their own course; men of capacity and intellect above the vulgar had
been fain, for reputation’s sake, to bow to the judgment of the time
and</p>
<p>the multitude; and thus, if any contemplations of a higher order took
light anywhere, they were presently blown out by the winds of</p>
<p>vulgar opinions.*®</p>
<p>And to pacify the theologians, who were powerful with the people or
the King, he cautioned his readers to “confine the sense” of his under -
taking “within the limits of duty in respect of things divine.” He
disclaimed any intention to deal with religiou s beliefs or affairs;
“the business in hand … is not an opinion to be held, but a work to be
done … I am laboring to lay the foundation not of any sect or doctrine,
but of human utility and power. He urged others to come forward and join
him in the work, and trusted that successive generations would carry it
on.</p>
<p>In an imperial prospectus, Distributio operis, he offered a plan of
the enterprise. First, he would attempt a new classification of existing
or desirable sciences, and would allot to them their problems and fields
of research; this he accomplished in The Advancement of Learning, which
he translated and expanded in De augmentis scientiarum (1623) to reach a
Continental audience. Second, he would examine the shortcomings of
contemporary logic, and seek a “more perfect use of human reason” than
that which Aristotle had formulated in his logical treatises
collectively known as the Organon; this Bacon did in his Novum Organum
(1620). Third, he would begin a “natural history” of the “phen omena of
the uni- verse” — astronomy, physics, biology. Fourth, he would exhibit,
in a “Ladder of the Intellect” {Scala intellectus) , examples of
scientific inquiry according to his new method. Fifth, as “Forerunners”
(Prodromi), he would describe “such things as I myself have discovered.”
And sixth, he would begin to expound that philosophy which, from
sciences so pur-</p>
<p>*74</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>sued, would be developed and certified. “The completion, however, of
this last part is . . . both above my strength and beyond my hope.” To
us who now flounder and gasp in the ocean of knowledge and specialties.
Bacon’s program seems majestically vain; but knowledge was not then so
im- mense and minute; and the brilliance of the parts performed forgives
the presumption of the whole. When he told Cecil, “I have taken all
knowl - edge to be my province,” he did not mean that he could embrace
all sci - ences in detail, but only that he purposed to survey the
sciences “as from a rock,” with a view to their co -ordination and
encouragement. William Harvey said of Bacon that he “wrote philosophy
like a lord chancellor”;®® yes, and planned it like an imperial
general.</p>
<p>We feel the range and sharpness of Bacon’s mind as we follow h im in
The Advancement of Learning. He offers his ideas with unwonted mod-
esty, as “not much better than that noise . . . which musicians make
while they are tuning their instruments”;®* but he strikes here nearly
all his characteristic notes. He calls for the multiplication and
support of colleges, libraries, laboratories, biological gardens,
museums of science and industry; for the better payment of teachers and
researchers; for ampler funds to finance scientific experiments; for
better intercommunication, co-operation, and division of labor among the
universities of Europe.^® He does not lose his perspective in the
worship of science; he defends a general and liberal education,
including literature and philosophy, as promoting a wise judg- ment of
ends to accompany the scientific improvement of means.^* He tries to
classify the sciences in a logical order, to determine their fields and
bounds, and to direct each to major problems awaiting inquiry and solu-
tion. Many of his demands have been met by the sciences — for better
clin- ical records, for the prolongation of life by preventive medicine,
for the careful examination of “psychical phenomena,” and for the
development of social psychology. He even anticipated our contemporary
studies in the technique of success.^®</p>
<p>The second and boldest part of the Great Renewal, was an attempt to
formulate a new method of science. Aristotle had recognized, and
occasion- ally preached, induction, but the predominant mode of his
logic was deduction, and its ideal was the syllogism. Bacon felt that
the old</p>
<p>Organon had kept science stagnant by its stress on theoretical
thought rather than practical observation. His Novum Organum proposed a
new organ and system of thought — the inductive study of nature itself
through experience and experiment. Though this book too was left
incomplete, it is, with all its imperfections, the most brilliant
production in English philosophy, the first clear call for an Age of
Reason. It was written in Latin, but in such lucid, pithy sentences that
half of it radiates epigrams. The very first lines compacted a
philosophy, announcing the inductive</p>
<p>CHAP, vir)</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>revolution, foreshadowing the Industrial Revolution, and giving
the</p>
<p>empirical key to Hobbes and Locke and Mill and Spencer.</p>
<p>Man, being the servant and interpreter of Nature, can do and under-
stand so much, and so much only, as he had observed, in fact or in</p>
<p>thought, of the course of Nature; beyond this he neither knows any-
thing nor can do anything . . . Human knowledge and human power meet in
one; for where the course is not known, the effect cannot</p>
<p>be produced. Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.*</p>
<p>And as Descartes seventeen years later, in the Discourse on Method,
would propose to begin philosophy by doubting everything, so Bacon here
demands an “expurgation of the intellect” as the first step in the
Renewal. “Human knowledge as we have it is a mere medley and ill-
digested mass, made up of much credulity and much accident, and also of
the childish notions which are at first imbibed.”** Therefore we must,
at</p>
<p>The true method of experience first lights the candle 〔by
hypoth-</p>
<p>esis〕, and then by means of the candle shows the way, commencing as
it does with experience duly ordered . . . and from it educing</p>
<p>axioms 〔“first fruits,” provisional conclusions〕, and from
established axioms again new experiments . . . Experiment itself shall
judge.*®</p>
<p>However, Bacon was wary of hypotheses; they were too often sug-</p>
<p>gested by tradition, prejudice, or desire — i.e., again by “idols”;
he dis - trusted any procedure in which hypothesis, consciously or not,
would</p>
<ul>
<li>The famous phrase “Knowledge is power” does not occur, in that form,
in Bacon’s extant works; but in a fragment of his Meditationes sacrae he

<p>176</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>select from experience confirmatory data and gloss over, or be blind
to, contrary evidence. To avoid this pitfall, he proposed a laborious
induction by accumulation of all facts pertinent to a problem, their
analysis, com- parison, classification, and correlation, and, “by a due
process of exclusion and rejection,” the progressive elimination of one
hypothesis after another, until the “form” or unde rlying law and
essence of a phenomenon should be revealed.^® Knowledge of the “form”
would give increasing control of the event, and science would gradually
remake the environment and possibly man himself.</p>
<p>For this. Bacon felt, is the ultimate aim — that the method of
science shall be applied to the rigorous analysis and resolute remolding
of human character. He urges a study of the instincts and emotions,
which bear the same relation to the mind as winds to the sea.^’ But here
especially the fault lies not merely in the seeking of knowledge but in
its transmission. Man could be remade by an enlightened education, if we
were willing to draw first-rate minds into pedagogy by giving them
adequate remuneration and honor.®® Bacon admires the Jesuits as
educators and wishes they were “on our side.”®* He condemns compendiums,
approves college dramatics, and pleads for more science in the
curriculum. Science and education so conceived would be (as in The New
Atlantis) not the tool and hand-</p>
<p>maid, but the guide and goal, of government. And the confident
Chancellor concludes, “I stake all on the victory of art over Nature in
the race.”</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>A statesman’s philosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, we feel, is a powerful mind — a man, one in a century, at home
equally in philosophy and politics. It would be interesting to know what
this philosopher thought in politics, and what this politician thought
in philosophy.</p>
<p>Not that he had any system in philosophy, or left any orderly
exposition of his thought, except in logic. The trend of his ideas is
clear, but their form is that of a man who had to rush repeatedly out of
the calm of phi- losophy to try a case in law, to fight an opposition in
Parliament, or to counsel an unteachable King. We must gather his views
from incidental remarks and literary fragments, including his Essays
(1597, 1612, 1625). With the vanity inherent in authorship. Bacon wrote,
in dedicating these to Buckingham, “I do conceive . . . 〔the〕 volume
may last as long as</p>
<p>books last.” In his le tters his style is labored and involved, so
that his wife confessed, “I do not understand his enigmatical folded
writing”;®® in the Essays he concealed still intenser labor, disciplined
his pen to clarity, and achieved such compact force of expression that
very few pages in English prose can match them for significant matter
pressed with luminous similes</p>
<p>CHAP. VII)</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>into perfect form. It is as if Tacitus had taken to philosophy, and
had con- descended to be clear.</p>
<p>Bacon’s wisdom is worldly. He leaves metaphysics to the mystical or
the rash; even his vaulting ambition rarely leaped from the fragment to
the whole. Sometimes, however, he seems to plunge into a determinist
material- ism: “In nature nothing really e xists besides individual
bodies performing pure individual acts according to a fixed law”;®^ and
“inquiries into nature have the best result when they begin with physics
and end in math- ematics”;®^ but “nature” here may mean only the
external world. He preferred the skeptical pre-Socratic philosophers to
Plato and Aristotle, and he praised the materialistic Democritus.®* But
then he accepts a sharp distinction between body and soul,®^ and
anticipates Bergson’s chiding of the intellect as a “constitutional
materialist”: “The human understanding is infected by the, sight of what
takes place in the mechanical arts . . . and so imagines that something
similar goes on in the universal nature of things.”®® He rejects in
advance the mechanistic biology o f Descartes.</p>
<p>With careful ambivalence he “seasons” his philosophy “with religion
as with salt.”®® “I had rather believe all the fables in the 〔Golden〕
Legend, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame
is with- out a mind.”®^ He puts atheism in its place in a famous passage
twice repeated.®® His analysis of the causes of atheism illuminates the
theme of this volume:</p>
<p>The causes of atheism are divisions in religion, if they be many;</p>
<p>for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides, but many
divi-</p>
<p>sions introduce atheism. Another is scandal of priests. And
lastly,</p>
<p>learned times, specially with peace and prosperity; for troubles and
adversities do more bow men’s minds to religion.®®</p>
<p>He lays it down as a r ule that “all knowledge is to be limited by
religion.”®® According to his chaplain, Rawley, he “repaired frequently,
when his health would permit him, to the services of the church . . .
and died in the true faith established in the Church of England.”® ^
Nevertheless, like his great predecessor William of Ockham, he availed
himself of the</p>
<p>distinction between theological and philosophical truth: faith might
hold to beliefs for which science and philosophy could find no evidence,
but philosophy should depend only on reason, and science should seek
purely secular explanations in terms of physical cause and effect.®*</p>
<p>Despite his zest for knowledge. Bacon subordinates it to
morality;</p>
<p>there would be no gain to humanity if the extension of knowledge</p>
<p>bro ught no gain in benevolence. “Of all virtues and dignities of the
mind, goodness is the greatest.”®* However, his usual enthusiasm
subsides when he speaks of the Christian virtues. Virtue should be
practiced in moderation, for the wicked may take advantage of the
indiscreetly good.*^ A little</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>dissimulation is necessary to success, if not to civilization. Love
is a mad- ness, and marriage is a noose. “He that hath wife and children
hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great
enterprises . . . The best works, and of the greatest merit for the
public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men.” Like
Elizabeth and Hildebrand, Bacon approved o f clerical celibacy. “A
single life doth well with church - men, for charity will hardly water
the ground when it must first fill a pool.”*® (Note his flair for
metaphor and Anglo -Saxon brevity.) Friendship is better than love, and
married men make unsteady friends. Bacon talks of love and marriage in
the strain of a man who has sacrificed the tender emotions to ambition,
and who could rule a kingdom better than his home.</p>
<p>His political philosophy faced conditions rather than theories. He
had the courage to say a good word for Machiavelli, and candidly
accepted the principle that states are not bound by the moral code
taught to their citizens. He felt, like Nietzsche, that a good war
halloweth any cause. “Neither is the opinion of some of the Schoolmen to
be received, that a war cannot be justly made but upon a precedent
injury or provocation . . . A just fear of an imminent danger, though
there be no blow given, is a lawful cause of war.” In any event, “a just
and honorable war is the true exercise” to keep a nation in trim.<em>®
“For empire and greatness it is of most importance that a nation profess
arms as their principal honor, study, and occupation.” A powerful navy
is a guarantee of neighborly res pect; “to be master of the sea is the
very epitome of monarchy.”</em>^ “In the youth of a state arms do
flourish; in the middle age of a state, learning; and then both of them
together for a time; in the declining age of a state, mercantile acts
and mercha nts.”*® Townsmen make poor warriors, peasants better, yeomen
best. Hence Bacon, like More, condemned enclosures, as reducing the
proportion of landowners in the population. He deprecated the
concentration of wealth as a chief cause of sedition and revolt. Of
these</p>
<p>the first remedy or prevention is to remove by all means possible
that material cause . . . which is want and poverty. . . . To which
purpose serveth the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing
of</p>
<p>manufactures; the banishing of idleness; the repression of waste and
excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil;
the regulating of prices of things vendible; the moderation of</p>
<p>taxes . . . Above all things good policy is to be used that the
treasures and monies in a state be not gathered into a few hands . . .
Money</p>
<p>is like muck, not good except it be spread.*®</p>
<p>Bacon distrusted Parliament as composed of uneducated and intolerant
landowners and merchants or their agents; he thought James I by compar-
ison informed and humane; even the King’s theoretical absolutism
seemed</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>benevolent as the alternative to greedy factions and violent creeds.
Like his contemporary Richelieu, he considered the centralization of
authority in the king, and the royal subordination of the great
landlords, a necessary step in the evolution of orderly government; and
like Voltaire, he thought it easier to educate one man than a multitude.
His own great wealth did not disturb him, and James proved obdurately
wedded to extrav- agance, taxes, and peace.</p>
<p>Bacon had smiled at “the philosophers” who “make imaginary laws for
imaginary commonwealths; their discourses are as the stars, which give
little light because they are so hi gh.” But in his tired age he yielded
to the temptation to picture the kind of society in which he would have
men live. He had doubtless read More’s Utopia (1516); Campanella had
just pub - lished his City of the Sun (1623); now (1624) Bacon wrote The
New</p>
<p>Atlantis. “We sailed from Peru (where we had continued for the</p>
<p>space of one whole year) for China and Japan by the South Sea.” A
long calm, failing rations, a providential isle, a people living happily
under laws made for them by a late King Salomon. Instead of a
parliament, a Salomon’s House — an aggregation of observatories,
laboratories, libraries, zoological and botanical gardens — manned by
scientists, economists, tech- nicians, physicians, psychologis ts, and
philosophers, chosen (as in Plato’s Republic) by equal tests after equal
educational opportunity, and then (without elections) governing the
state, or, rather, ^ruling nature in the interest of man. “The end of
our Foundation,” one of these rule rs explains to the barbarians from
Europe, “is the knowledge of causes and secret motions of things, and
the enlarging of the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all
things possible.”^® Already, in this South Pacific en - chantment, the
Salomonic wizards have invented microscopes, telescopes, self-winding
clocks, submarines, automobiles, and airplanes; they have discovered
anesthetics, hypnosis, and ways of preserving health and lengthening
life; they have found ways of grafting plants, generating new species,
transmuting metals, and transmitting music to distant places. In
Salomon’s House government and science are bound together, and all the
tools and organization of research that Bacon had begged James to
provide are there part of the equipment of the state. The island is
economically independent; it avoids foreign trade as a snare to war; it
imports knowledge, but not goods. So the humbled philosopher replaces
the proud statesman, and the same man who had advised an occasional war
as a social tonic now in his closing years dreams of a paradise of
peace.</p>

<p>He continued working to the end. A year after his retirement he pub-
lished a History of the Reign of Henry Vll. It set a new standard
for</p>
<p>historiography: a clear account, in fine, strong prose, of issues,
policies, and events; a just, impartial, penetrating sketch of a ruler
unideaGzed, il- luminatingly real.’^^ A medley of treatises followed:
History 〔i.e., a study〕 of Winds, History of Density and Rarity,
History of Life and Death,</p>
<p>Sylva Sylvarum, and further essays. He had unexpected leisure now —
no place, no children, no friends, for the place seekers who had crowded
about him in his days of power were scraping before other doors. “What
comrades have you in your work?” he asked a correspondent. “As for me, I
am in the completest solitude.”^^</p>
<p>Seeking to test how long snow could keep flesh from putrefaction, he
interrupted a journey one day in spring to buy a fowl. He killed it and
stuffed it with snow, then found himself chilled. He went to the nearby
home of Lord Arundel and was there put to bed. He thought the trouble
would soon pass; he wrote that the ex periment had “succeeded
excellently well.” He had preserved the fowl — but he lost his life.
Fever consumed him, phlegm choked him; on April 9, 1626, he died, aged
sixty-five, the glowing candle suddenly snuffed out.</p>
<p>He was not, as Pope thought, “the wisest, brightest, meanest of man -
kind.”^* Montaigne was wiser, Voltaire brighter, Henry VIII meaner; and
Bacon’s enemies called him kindly, helpful, and quick to forgive. He was
self-seeking to the verge of servility, and proud enough to anger the
gods; but we share these faults sufficiently to pardon his humanity for
the light that he shed. His egotism was the wind in his sails. To see
ourselves as others see us would be crippling.</p>
<p>He was not a scientist, but a philosopher of science. His range of
ob- servation was immense, but his field of speculation was too vast to
allow him much time for special investigations; he attempted some, with
little result. He fell far behind the progress of contemporary science.
He re- jected the Copernican astronomy, but gave excellent reasons for
doing so.^^ He ignored Kepler, Galileo, and Napier. He often noted (as
in</p>
<p>The New Atlantis), but still underrated, the role of imagination,
hypoth- esis, and deduction in scientific research. His proposal for a
patient col- lection and classification of facts worked well in
astronomy, where the stellar observations and records of thousands of
students gave Copernicus inductive material for his revolutionary
deductions; but it bore small re- semblance to the actual methods that
in his time discovered the laws of</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE SUMMONS TO REASON l8l</p>
<p>planetary motions, the satellites of Jupiter, the magnetism of the
earth, and the circulation of the blood.</p>
<p>He did not claim to have discovered induction; he knew that many</p>
<p>men had practiced it before him. He was not the first to “overthrow
Aris - totle”; men like Roger Bacon and Petrus Ramus had been doing this
for centuries past. And the Aristotle whom they deposed was not (as
Francis Bacon sometimes realized) the Greek who had often used and
praised induction and experiment, but the transmogrified ille
philosophus of the Arabs and the Scholastics. What Bacon wanted to
overthrow was the mistaken attempt to deduce medieval creeds from
ancient metaphysics. In any event, he helped to free Renaissance Europe
from too cramping a deference to antiquity.</p>
<p>He was not the first to emphasize knowledge as the road to power;</p>
<p>Roger Bacon had done it, and Campanella had said, with Baconian
pithi- ness, “Tantum possumus quantum scimus ’^ — Our power is
proportioned to our knowledge.^® Perhaps the statesman stressed unduly
the utilitarian ends of science. Yet he recognized the value of “pure”
as compared with</p>
<p>“applied” science — of “light” as distinct from “fruits.” He urged a
study of ends as well as of means, and knew that a century of inventions
would create greater problems than it solved if it left human motives
unchanged. He might have discovered in his own moral laxity the abyss
created by the progress of knowledge beyond the discipline of
character.</p>
<p>^at remains after all these hindsight deductions? This: that
Francis</p>
<p>Bacon was the most powerful and influential intellect of his time.
Shake- speare, of course, stood above him in imagination and literary
art; but Bacon’s mind ranged over the universe like a searchlight
peering and prying curiously into every corner and secret of space. All
tbe exhilarating en- thusiasm of the Renaissance was in him, all the
excitement and pride of a Columbus sailing madly into a new world. Hear
the joyful cry of this Cock Robin announcing the dawn:</p>
<p>Thus have I concluded this portion of learning touching Gvil</p>
<p>Knowledge; and with civil knowledge have concluded Human Phi-</p>
<p>losophy; and with human philosophy. Philosophy in General. And</p>
<p>being now at some pause, looking back into that I have passed</p>
<p>through, this writing seemeth to me, as far as a man can judge of his
own work, not much better than that noise or sound which musicians make
while they are tuning their instruments; which is nothing</p>
<p>pleasant to hear, but yet is a cause why the music is sweeter
after-</p>
<p>wards. So have I been content to tune the instruments of the muses
that they may play that have better hands. And surely, when I set</p>
<p>before me the condition of these times, in which learning hath made
her third visitation or circuit, in all the qualities thereof; as the
excel-</p>
<p>i 82</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>lency and vivacity of the wits of this age; the noble helps and
lights</p>
<p>which we have by the travails of ancient writers; the art of
printing,</p>
<p>which communicateth books to men of all fortunes; the openness of the
world by navigation, which hath disclosed multitudes of experi-</p>
<p>ments, and a mass of natural history; … I cannot but be raised to</p>
<p>this persuasion, that this third period of time will far surpass that
of the Graecian and Roman learning. … As for my labours, if any, if</p>
<p>any man shall please himself or others in the reprehension of them,
they shall make that ancient and patient request, Verbere sed atidi</p>
<ul>
<li>Strike me if you will, only hear me〕; let men reprehend them,
so</li>
</ul>
<p>they observe and weigh them.^®</p>
<p>Because he expressed the noblest passion of his age — for the
betterment</p>
<p>Men would not listen to him at first; in England, France, and Germany
they preferred to carry the competition of faiths to the arbitrament of
arms; but when that fury had cooled, those who were not fettered with
certainties organized themselves in the spirit of Bacon for the
enlargement of man’s empire not over men but over the conditions and
hindrances -of human life. When Englishmen founded the Royal Society of
London for Improving Natural Knowledge (1660), it was Francis Bacon who
was honored as its inspiration, and Salomon’s House in The New Atlantis
probably pointed the goal.” Leibniz hailed Bacon as the regenerator of
philosophy.’^® And when the philosophes of the Enlightenment put to-
gether their world-shaking Ency elope die (1751), they dedicated it to
Francis Bacon. “If,” said Diderot in the prospectus, “we have come to it
successfully, we shall owe most to the Chancellor Bacon, who proposed
the plan of a universal dictionary of sciences and arts at a time when,
so to speak, neither arts nor sciences existed. That extraordinary
genius, at a time when it was impossible to write a history of what was
known, wrote one of what it was necessary to learn.” And d’Alembert, in
a frenzy of enthusiasm, c alled Bacon “the greatest, the most universal,
and the most eloquent of philosophers.” When the Enlightenment had burst
into the French Revolution the Convention had the works of Bacon
published at</p>
<p>CHAP, vn)</p>
<p>THE SUMMONS TO REASON</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>the expense of the state.^® The tenor and career of British thought
from Hobbes to Spencer — excepting Berkeley and Hume and the English
Hegelians — followed Bacon’s line. His tendency to conceive the external
world in Democritean terms gave Hobbes the impetus to materialism; his
emphasis on induction spurred Locke to an empirical psychology in which
the study of the mind would be freed from the metaphysics of the soul;
and his stress on “commodities” and “fruits” shared with the philosophy
of Helvetius in leading Bentham to identify the useful and the good. The
Baconian spirit prepared England for the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Therefore we may place Francis Bacon at the head of the Age of</p>
<p>Reason. He was not, like some of his successors, an idolater of
reason; he distrusted all cogitations unchecked by actual experience,
and all conclu- sions tainted with desire. “The human understanding is
no dry light, but receives an infusion from the will and affections;
whence proceed sciences which may be ca lled ‘sciences as one would.’
For what a man had rather</p>
<p>hoped.”®<br />
</p>
<p>Nor did he, like the philosophes of the eighteenth century,
propose</p>
<p>reason as an enemy of religion or as a substitute for it; he made
room for both of them in philosophy and life. But he repudiated the
reliance upon traditions and authorities; he required rational and
natural explanations instead of emotional presumptions, supernatural
interventions, and popular mythology. He raised a banner for all the
sciences, and drew to it the most eager minds of the succeeding
centuries. Whether he willed it or not, the enterprise that he called
for — the comprehensive organization of scientific research, the
ecumenical expansion and dissemination of knowledge — con- tained in
itself the seeds of the profoundest drama of modem times: Chris-
tianity, Catholic or Protestant, fighting for its life against the
spread and power of science and philosophy. That drama had now spoken
its prologue to the world.</p>
