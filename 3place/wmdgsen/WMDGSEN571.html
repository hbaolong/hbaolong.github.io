<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>The Great Queen</p>
<p>1558-1603</p>
<p>I. THE USES OF ADVERSITY</p>
<p>O N November 17, 1558, a courier galloped into the court of the royal
palace at Hatfield, thirty-six miles north of London, and announced</p>
<p>to Elizabeth Tudor that she was Queen of England. Her half-sister
Queen Mary, of pitiful fame, had died in the dark of that morning. In
London the Parliament, receiving the news, cried out, “God save Queen
Elizabeth! Long may she reign over us!” — not dreaming that it would be
forty-five years. The churches, though foreboding trouble, thrilled the
air with the clangor of their bells. The people of England, as they had
done for Mary, spread festive tables in the streets, and that evening
they colored the sky with bonfires of eternal hope.</p>
<p>By Saturday the nineteenth the leading lords, ladies, and commoners
of the realm had gathered at Hatfield to vow their allegiance and
feather their nests. To them, on the twentieth, Elizabeth spoke right
royally:</p>
<p>My Lords: The laws of nature move me to sorrow for my sister;</p>
<p>the burden that has fallen upon me maketh me amazed; and yet, con-
sidering I am God’s creature ordained to obey His appointment, I</p>
<p>will thereto yield; desiring from the bottom of my heart that I
may</p>
<p>have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will
in the office now committed to me. And as I am but one body materially
considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so</p>
<p>shall I desire you all, my lords, chiefly you of the nobility, every
one</p>
<p>in his degree and power, to be assistant to me; that I with my
ruling, and you with your service, may make a good account to
Almighty</p>
<p>God, and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth.^</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth, clad in purple velvet, Elizabeth rode
through</p>
<p>London in public procession to that same Tower where, four years
earlier, she had been a prisoner awaiting death. Now, on her route, the
populace acclaimed her, choruses chanted her glory, children tremblingly
recited to her the little speeches of homage they had memorized, and
“such shoot - ing of guns as never was heard afore” heralded a reign
destined to abound, beyond any English precedent, in splendor of men and
minds.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Twenty-five years of trials had tempered Elizabeth to mastery. It</p>
<p>seemed, in 1533, good fortune to have been fathered by Henry VIII,
but it was dangerous to have been bom of Anne Boleyn. The disgrace and
execution of the mother fell within the child’s forgetful years (1536);
yet the pain of that somber heritage outlived her youth and yielded only
to the balm of sovereignty. An act of Par liament (1536) declared Anne’s
marriage null, making Elizabeth illegitimate; coarse gossip debated the
girl’s paternity; in any case, to most Englishmen she was the daughter
of adultery. Her legitimacy was never re-established in law, but another
act of Parliament ( 1 544) confirmed her right, after her half-brother
Edward and her half- sister Mary, to succeed to the throne. During
Edward’s rule (1547-53) she adhered to the Protestant worship; but when
Catholic Mary acceded, Elizabeth, preferring life to consistency,
conformed to the Roman ritual. After Wyatt’s Rebellion (1554) had failed
to unseat Mary, Elizabeth was accused of complicity and was sent to the
Tower; but Mary judged her guilt unproved, and released her to live
under surveillance at Woodstock. Before Mary died she recognized her
sister as her successor and sent her the jewels of the Crown. We owe
Elizabeth’s reign to the kindliness of the “bloody” Queen.</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s more formal education was overwhelming. Her famous</p>
<p>tutor, Roger Ascham, boasted that “she talks French and Italian as
well as she does English, and has often talked to me readily and well in
Latin, moderately in Greek.” - She had a daily stint of theology and
became expert in Protestant dogma; but her Italian teachers seem to have
transmitted to her something of the skepticism they had imbibed from
Pomponazzi, Machiavelli, and Renaissance Rome.</p>
<p>She was never sure of her crown. Parliament (1553) had reaffirmed the
invalidity of her mother’s marriage to her father; state and Church
agreed that she was a bastard; and English law, ignoring William the
Conqueror, excluded bastards from the throne. The whole Catholic world —
and Eng- land was still largely Catholic — believed that the legal heir
to the English scepter was Mary Stuart, great-granddaughter of Henry
VII. It was in- timated to Elizabeth that if she made her peace with the
Church the Pope would wash her free of bastardy and recognize her right
to rule. She was not so inclined. Thousands of Englishmen held property
that had been expropriated from the Church by Parliament under Henry
VIII and</p>
<p>Edward VI. These influential possessors, fearing that a continued
Catholic restoration might enforce restitution, were prepared to fight
for a Protes- tant queen; and the Catholics of England preferred her to
civil war. On January 15, 1559, amid the acclamation of Protestant
London, Elizabeth was crowned in Westminster Abbey as “Queen of England,
France, and Ire land, Defender of the Faith.” For English monarchs,
since Edward III,</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>had regularly claimed the throne of France. Nothing had been left
undone to provide the Queen with problems.</p>
<p>She was now twenty-five, in all the charm of maturing womanhood. She
was moderately tall, with a good figure, fair features, olive
complexion, flashing eyes, auburn hair, and beautiful hands which she
knew how to display.® It seemed impossible that such a lass should cope
successfully with the chaos that encompassed her. Hostile creeds divided
the land, play- ing for power and wielding arms. Pauperism was endemic,
and vagrancy had survived the terrible penalties laid upon it by Henry
VIII. Domestic trade was clogged by a dishonest currency; half a century
of false coinage had left the credit of the fisc so low that the
government had to pay 14 per cent for loans. Mary Tudor, absorbed in
religion, had skimped on national defense, the fortresses were
neglected, the coasts unprotected, the navy unfit, the army ill paid and
ill fed, and its cadres unfilled. England, which under Wolsey had held
the balance of power in Europe, was now a po- litical cripple bandied
about between Spain and France; French troops were in Scotland, and
Ireland was inviting Spain. The Pope was holding over the Queen’s head
the threat of excommunication and interdict and of invasion by the
Catholic states. Invasion definitely loomed in 1559, and fear of
assassination was p art of Elizabeth’s life from day to day. She was
saved by the disunion of her enemies, the wisdom of her counselors, and
the courage of her soul. The Spanish ambassador was shocked by “the
spirit of the woman . . . She is possessed of the Devil, who is dragging
her to his place.”^ Europe had not expected to find the spirit of an
emperor</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>ELIZABETHAN GOVERNMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>Her penetration proved itself at once in her choice of aides. Like
her embattled father — and despite her politic speech at Hatfield — ^she
chose men of untitled birth, for most of the older nobles were Catholic,
and some thought themselves fitter than she to wear the crown. As her
secretary and principal adviser she named William Cecil, whose genius
for prudent policy and assiduous detail became so outstanding a factor
in her success that those who did not know her thought him king. His
grandfather was a prosperous yeoman become country gentleman; his father
was yeoman of the ward- robe to Henry VIII; his mother’s dowry raised
the family to a comfortable estate. William left Cambridge without a
degree, took law at Gray’s Inn, sowed his wild oats in London’s common
fields,® entered the House of Commons at twenty-three ( 1 543 ) , and
married, as his second wife, Mildred Cooke, whose grim Puritanism helped
him toe the Protestant line. He</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(caiAP. 1</p>
<p>served Protector Somerset, then Somerset’s enemy Northumberland.
He</p>
<p>I give you this charge that you shall be of my Privy Council, and</p>
<p>content to take pains for me and my realm. This judgment I have
of</p>
<p>you that you will not be corrupted by any manner of gift, and that
you will be faithful to the state; and that without respect of my
private</p>
<p>will you will give me that counsel which you think best; and if
you</p>
<p>shall know anything necessary to be declared to me of secrecy,
you</p>
<p>shall show it to myself only. And assure yourself I will not fail to
keep taciturnity therein. And therefore herewith I charge you.®</p>
<p>The test of his fidelity and competence is that she kept him as
secretary for fourteen years, then as Lord Treasurer for twenty-six
more, till his death. He presided over the Council, managed foreign
relations, directed public finance and national defense, and guided
Elizabeth in the definitive establishment of Protestantism in England.
Like Richelieu, he thought the safety and stability of his country
required the unifying absolutism of the monarch as against the divisive
ambitions of contentious nobles, covetous merchants, and fratricidal
faiths. He had some Machiavellian ways, rarely cruel, but relentless
against opposition;’^ once he thought of having the Earl of Westmorland
assassinated;® but that was an impatient moment in a half century of
patient tenacity and personal rectitude. He had eyes and spies for
everything, but eternal vigilance is the price of power. He was
acquisitive and thrifty, but Elizabeth pardoned his wealth for his
wisdom and loved the parsimony that accumulated the means for de-
feating the Armada. Without him she might have been misled by such
lighter lights and spendthrift peacocks as Leicester, Hatton, and Essex.
Cecil, reported the Spanish ambassador, “has more genius than the rest
of the Council put together, and is theref ore envied and hated on all
sides.”® Elizabeth sometimes listened to his enemies, and now and then
treated him so harshly that he left her presence broken and in tears;
but she knew, when out of her tantrums, that he was the steadiest pillar
of her reign. In 1571 she made him Lord Burghley, head of the new
aristocracy that, in the face of hostile nobles, upheld her throne and
made her kingdom great. Her minor aides deserve a line even in hurried
history, for they served her with competence, courage, and scant
remuneration, to the exhaustion of their lives. Sir Nicholas Bacon,
father of Francis, was Lord Keeper of</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>the Great Seal from the outset of the reign till his death (1579);
Sir</p>
<p>Francis Knollys was a privy councilor from 1558 and treasurer of the
royal household till his end (1596); Sir Nicholas Throckmorton was her
skillful ambassador in France, and Thomas Randolph in Scotland, Russia,
and Germany. Only next to Cecil in devotion and craft was Sir Francis
Walsingham, a Secretary of State from 1573 to his death (1590); a man of
sensitive refinement, whom Spenser called “the great Maecenas of his
age”; so shocked by repeated plots agains t the Queen’s life that he
formed for her protection a web of espionage that stretched from
Edinburgh to Con- stantinople, and caught in its skein the tragic Queen
of Scots. Seldom has a ruler had servitors so able, so loyal, and so
poorly paid.</p>
<p>For the English government itself was poor. Private fortunes outshone
public funds. The revenue in 1600 totaled 500,000,^° which even now
would be a paltry 5,000,000. Elizabeth seldom levied direct taxes, and
she took in only ^ 36,000 in customs dues. Ordinarily she relied on
income from Crown lands, on grants in aid from the English Church, and
on</p>
<p>“loans” from the rich, which were practically compulsory but
punctually repaid.^^ She honored the debts left by her father, her
brother, and her sister, and acquired such a reputation for solvency
that she could borrow money at Antwerp at 5 per cent, while Philip II of
Spain at times could not borrow at all. She was extravagant, however, in
her expenditure for dresses and finery, and in gifts of economic
privileges to her favorites.</p>
<p>Rarely, and reluctantly, she summoned Parliament to her financial
aid, for she did not patiently bear opposition, criticism, or
surveillance. She put no stock in theories of popular or parliamentary
sovereignty; she be- lieved with Homer and Shakespeare that only one
head should rule — and why not hers, in which ran the blood and burned
the pride of Henry VIII? She held to the divine right of kings and
queens. She imprisoned persons at her own sharp will, without trial or
stated cause; and her Privy Council, acting as the Court of Star Chamber
to try political offenders, suspended without appeal the rights of
habeas corpus and jury trial.^^ She punished Ad.P.s who obstructed her
purposes. She suggested to the local magnates who manipulated elections
to Parliament that it would facilitate matters if they chose candidates
with no boyish notions about free speech; she wanted pounds without
palaver. Her early Parliaments yielded gracefully; her middle
Parliaments yielded angrily; her later Parliaments neared revolt.</p>
<p>She got her will because the nation preferred her judicious
absolutism to the fury of factions competing for power. No one thought
of letting the people rule; politics was — as always — a contest of
minorities to de- termine which should rule the majority. Half of
England resented Eliza- beth’s religious policy, nearly all England
resented her celibacy; but by and large the people, grateful for low
taxes, flourishing trade, domestic</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>order, and prolonged peace, returned the affection offered them by
the Queen. She gave them pageants and “progresses,” listened to them
without visible boredom, shared in their public games, and in a hundred
other ways “fished for men’s souls.”^® The Spanish ambassador, while
bemoaning her Protestantism, wrote to Philip: “She is much attached to
the people, and is confident that they are all on her side, which is
indeed true.”^^ The attempts that were made on her life strengthened her
popularity and power; even the Puritans whom she persecuted prayed for
her safety; and the anniversary of her accession became a day of
national thanksgiving and festival.</p>
<p>Was she the actual ruler, or only a popular front for the lower
nobility of England and the mercantile oligarchy of London.^ Her aides,
though fearing her temper, often corrected her mistakes of policy — ^but
she often corrected theirs. They told her disagreeable truths, gave her
their con- tradictory counsels, and obeyed her decisions; they governed,
but she ruled. “She gives her orders,” reported the Spanish ambassador,
“and has her way as absolutely as her father.”^® Cecil himself se ldom
knew how she would decide, and he fretted over her frequent rejection of
his laborious and meticulous advice. When he urged her not to treat with
France, but to rely solely on Protestant support, she pulled him up with
some asperity: “Mr. Secretar y, I mean to have done with this business;
I shall listen to the proposals of the French King. I am not going to be
tied any longer to you and your brethren in Christ.”^®</p>
<p>Her statesmanship drove both friends and enemies to tears. She was
mad- deningly slow and irresolute in determining policy; but in many
cases her indecision paid. She knew how to ally herself with time, which
dissolves more problems than men solve; her procrastination allowed the
complex factors in a situation to settle themselves into focus and
clarity. She ad- mired the fabled philosopher who, when importuned for
an answer, silently recited the alphabet before replying. She took as
her motto Video et taceo — “I see and am silent.” She discovered that in
politics, as in love, he who does not hesitate is lost. If her policy
often fluctuated, so did the facts and forces to be weighed. Surrounded
by perils and intrigues, she felt her way with forgivable caution,
trying now one course, now another, and making no claim to consistency
in so fluid a world. Her vacillation stumbled into some serious errors,
but it kept England at peace until it was strong enough for war.
Inheriting a nation politically in chaos and</p>
<p>militarily in decay, her only practicable policy was to keep Engla
nd’s enemies from uniting against it, to encourage the Huguenot revolt
against the French monarchy, the Netherlands revolt against Spain, the
Protestant revolt against a Scottish Queen too closely bound to France.
It was an unscrupulous policy, but Elizabeth believed with Machiavelli
that scruples</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>are not becoming in rulers responsible for states. By whatever means
her subtle weakness could devise she preserved her country from foreign
domination, maintained peace — ^with some brief intervals — for thirty
years, and left England richer than ever before in matter and mind.</p>
<p>As a diplomat she could give the foreign secretaries of the age many
a lesson in alert information, resourceful expedients, and incalculable
moves. She was the ablest liar of her time. Of the four women — Mary
Tudor, Mary Stuart, Catherine de Medicis, and Elizabeth — ^who
illustrated Knox’s “monstrous regiment 〔rule〕 of women” in the second
half of the sixteenth century, Elizabeth was unquestionably supreme in
political acumen and diplomatic skill. Cecil thought her “the wisest
woman that ever was, for she understood the interest and dispositions of
all the princes in her time, and was so perfect in the knowledge of her
own realm that no. councilor she had could tell her anything she did not
know before”^^ — which, of course, requires a grain of salt. She had the
advantage of conferring directly with ambassadors in French, Italian, or
Latin, and was thereby independent of interpreters and intermediaries.
“This woman,” said the Spanish am - bassador, “is possessed with a
hundred thousand devils; yet she pretends to me that she would like to
be a nun, live in a cell, and tell her beads from morning till night.
Every Continental government condemned and</p>
<p>admired her. “If she were not a heretic,” said Pope Sixtus V, “she
would be worth a whole world.”^®</p>
<ol start="111" type="1">
<li>THE AMOROUS VIRGIN</li>
</ol>
<p>The secret weapon of her diplomacy was her virginity. This condition,
of course, is a recondite detail on which historians must not pretend to
certainty; let us be as trustful as Raleigh naming a colony. Cecil,
watching Elizabeth’s long flirtation with Leicester, had some passing
doubts, but two Spanish ambassadors, not loath to dishonor the Queen,
concluded to her honor.^® The gossip of the court, as reported by Ben
Jonson to Drum- mond of Hawthornden, held that “she had a membrane on
her which made her incapable of man, though for her delight she tried
many. … A French surgeon undertook to cut it, yet fear stayed her.”^^
“The people,” wrote Camden in his Annales (1615), “cursed Huic, the
Queen’s physician, as having dissuaded the Queen from marrying on
account of some im- pediment an d defect in her.”^* Yet Parliament,
repeatedly begging her to marry, assumed her capacity to bear. Something
went wrong, in this regard, with most of Tudor royalty: probably the
misfortunes of Catherine of Aragon in childbirth were due to Henry
VIII’s s yphilis; his son Edward died in youth of some ill-described
disease; his daughter Mary tried</p>
<p>lO</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>fervently to have a child, only to mistake dropsy for pregnancy; and
Elizabeth, though she flirted as long as she could walk, never ventured
on marriage. “I have always shrunk from it,” she said; and as early as
1559 she declared her intention to remain a virgin.®* In 1566 she
promised Parliament, “I will marry as soon as I can conveniently . . .
and I hope to have children.”®^ But in that same year, when Cecil told
her that Mary Stuart had borne a son, Elizabeth almost wept, and said,
“The Queen of Scots is the mother of a fair son, and I am but a barren
stock.”®® There for a moment she revealed her lasting grief — that she
could not fulfill her womanhood.</p>
<p>The political implications deepened the tragedy. Many of her Catholic
subjects believed her sterility a proper punishment for her father’s
sins and a promise that Catholic Mary Stuart would inherit the crown.
But Parlia- ment and the rest of Protestant England dreaded such a
prospect and importuned her to find a mate. She tried, but began by
losing her heart to a married man. Lord Robert Dudley, tall, handsome,
accomplished, courtly, brave, was the son of that Duke of Northumberland
who had died on the scaffold for trying to disinherit Mary Tudor and
make Jane Grey queen. Dudley was married to Amy Robsart, but was not
living with her, and rumor called him an unprincipled philanderer. He
was with Elizabeth at Windsor when his wife fell downstairs at Cumnor
Hall and died of a broken neck (1560). He and the Queen were suspected,
by the Spanish ambassador and others, of having arranged this clumsy
annulment; the suspicion was unjust,®® but it ended for a while Dudley’s
hopes of be - coming consort to Elizabeth. When she thought she was
dying (1562), she begged that he might be appointed protector of the
realm; she con- fessed that she had long loved him, but called God to
witness that “nothing un seemly” had ever passed between them.®^ Two
years later she offered him to the Queen of Scots and made him Earl of
Leicester to enhance his charms, but Mary was loath to have her rival’s
lover in her bed. Elizabeth comforted him with monopolies, and favored
him till his death (1588).</p>
<p>Cecil had borne this romance with dignified hostility. For a time
he</p>
<p>thought of resigning in protest, for his own plan contemplated a
marriage that would strengthen England with the friendship of some
powerful state. For a quarter of a century a succession of foreign
suitors danced about the Queen. “There are twelve ambassadors of us,”
wrote one of them, “all competing for her Majesty’s hand; and the Duke
of Holstein is coming next, as a suitor for the King of Denmark. The
Duke of Finland, who is here for his brother the King of Sweden,
threatens to kill the</p>
<p>Emperor’s man, and the Queen - fears they will cut each other’s
throat in her presence.”®* She must have felt some satisfac tion when
Philip II, the greatest potentate in Christendom, offered her his
seasoned hand (1559).</p>
<p>CHAP, l) THE GREAT QUEEN II</p>
<p>but she rejected this device for making England a Catholic dependency
of Spain. She took more time in answering a proposal from Charles IX of
France, for France was meanwhile kept on good behavior. The French
ambassador complained that “the world had been made in six days, and she
had already spent eighty days and was still undecided”; she artfully re
- plied that the worl d “had been made by a greater artist than
herself.”^” Two years later she allowed English agents to propose her
marriage to Charles, Archduke of Austria; but at Leicester’s urging she
withdrew the</p>
<p>encouraged to think of becoming the sixteen-year-old husband of the
thirty-seven-year-old Queen; but the negotiations were wrecked on three
obstacles — the Duke’s Catholic faith, his tender youth, and his pock -
marked nose. Five years softened one of these deterrents, and Alengon,
now Duke of Anjou, was considered again; he was invited to London, and
for five years more Elizabeth played with him and France. After a final
flurry (1581) this gay courtship petered out, and Anjou retired from the
field waving as a trophy a garter of the Queen. Meanwhile she had kept
him from marrying the Infanta and thereby allying her two enemies,
France and Spain. Rarely has a woman derived so much advantage from
barrenness, or so much pleasure from virginity.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ELIZABETH AND HER COURT</li>
</ol>
<p>There was more satisfaction in being courted by virile Elizabethans
than in being bedded by a poxy youth, and the courtship could last as
long as marriage did not stifle it. Hence Elizabeth enjoyed perennial
adulation and savored it insatiably. Lords ruined themselves to
entertain her; masques and pageants allegorized her glory; poets
smothered her with sonnets and dedications; musicians strummed her
praise. A madrigal celebrated her eyes as war- subduing orbs, and her
breast as “that fair hill where virtue dwells and sacred skill.”<em>®
Raleigh told her that she walked like Venus, hunted like Diana, rode
like Alexander, sang like an angel, and played like Orpheus.</em>^ She
almost believed it. She was as vain as if all the merits of her England
were the blessed fruit of her mothering; and to a degree they were.
Distrustful of her physical charms, she robed herself in costly</p>
<p>dresses, varying them almost every day; at her death she left two
thousand. She wore jewelry in her hair, on her arms and wrists and ears
and gowns; when a bishop reproved her love of finery she had him warned
not to touch on that subject again, lest he reach heaven
aforetime.®*</p>
<p>Her manners could be alarming. She cuffed or fondled courtiers,
even</p>

<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>foreign emissaries. She tickled the back of Dudley’s neck when he
knelt to receive his earldom.* She spat as she list — once upon a costly
coat. She was usually amiable and easy of access, but she talked
volubly, and she could be an unanswerable shrew. She swore like a pirate
(which, by proxy, she was) ; “by God’s death” w as among her milder
oaths. She could be cruel, as in playing cat and mouse with Mary Stuart,
or letting Lady Catherine Grey languish and die in the Tower; but she
was basically kind and merciful, and she mingled tenderness with her
blows. She often lost her temper, but she soon regained control of
herself. She roared with laughter when amused, which was often. She
loved to dance, and</p>
<p>pirouetted till she was sixty-nine. She gamboled and gambled and
hunted, and was fond of masques and plays. She kept her spirits up even
when her fortunes were low, and in the face of danger she was all
courage and intelligence. She was abstemious in food and drink, but
covetous of money and jewelry; with relish she confiscated the property
of rich rebels; and she managed to get and to hold the crown jewels of
Scotland, Burgundy, and Portugal, besides a hoard of gems presented by
expectant lords. She was not renowned for gratitude or liberality;
sometimes she tried to pay her servants in fair words; but there was a
certain patriotism in her</p>
<p>parsimony and her pride. When she acceded there was hardly a nation
so poor as to do England reverence; when she died England controlled the
seas and challenged the intellectual hegemony of Italy or France.</p>
<p>What sort of mind did she have? She had all the learning that a queen
could carry gracefully. While ruling England she continued her study of
languages; corresponded in French with Mary Stuart, bandied Italian with
a Venetian ambassador, and berated a Polish envoy in virile Latin. She
translated Sallust and Boethius, and knew enough Greek to read Sophocles
and translate a play of Euripides’. She claimed to have read as many
books as any prince in Christendom, and it was likely. She</p>
<p>studied history almost every day. She composed poetry and music, and
played forgivably on the lute and the virginal. But she had sense enough
to laugh at her accomplishments, and to distinguish between education
and intelligence. When an ambassador complimented her on her languages
she remarked that “it was no marvel to teach a woman to talk; it were
far harder to teach her to hold her tongue.”®’* Her mind was as sharp as
her speech, and her wit kept pace with the time. Francis Bacon reported
that “she was wont to say of her instructions to great officers that
they were like to garments, strait at the first putting on, but did by
and by wear</p>
<p>•Aubrey tells a naughty story. Edward de Vere, “Earle of Oxford,
making his low obeisance to Queen Elizabeth, happened to let a Fart, at
which he was so abashed and ashamed that he went to Travell, 7 yeares.
On his returne the Queen welcomed him homq, and sayd, My Lord, I had
forgott the Fart.”®^</p>

<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>loose enough.”®® Her letters and speeches were composed in an English
all her own, devious, involved, and affected, but rich in quaint turns,
fascinating in eloquence and character.</p>
<p>She excelled in intelligence rather than intellect. Walsingham
pro-</p>
<p>nounced her “inapt to embrace any matter of weight”;®* but perhaps he
spoke in the bitterness of unrequited devotion. Her skill lay in
feminine delicacy and subtlety of perception, not in laborious logic,
and sometimes the outcome revealed more wisdom in her feline tentatives
than in their reasoning. It was her indefinable spirit that counted,
that baffled Europe and enthralled England, that gave spur and color to
her country’s flower - ing. She re-established the Reformation, but she
represented the Renais- sance — the lust to live this earthly life to
the full, to enjoy and embellish it every day. She was no exemplar of
virtue, but she was a paragon of vitality. Sir John Hayward, whom she
sent to the Tower for giving re- bellious notions to the younger Essex,
forgave her enough to write of her, nine years after she could reward
him;</p>
<p>Now, if ever any person had eyther the gift or the stile to winne</p>
<p>the hearts of people, it was this Queene; if ever she did expresse
the same, it was … in coupling mildness with majesty as she did, and
in</p>
<p>stately stouping to the meanest sort. All her facultyes were in
motione, and every motione seemed a well-guided actione; her eyes were
set upon one, her ears listened to another, her judgment ran upon a
third, to a fourth she addressed her speech; her spirit seemed to be
every- where, and yet so intyre in her selfe, as it seemed to bee noe
where else. Some she pityed, some she commended, some she thanked, at
others she pleasantly and wittingly jested, contemning no person,</p>
<p>neglecting no office; and distributing her smiles, lookes, and graces
so artificially 〔artfully〕 that thereupon the people again redoubled
the</p>
<p>testimonyes of their joyes. ®’</p>
<p>Her court was her character — loving the things she loved, and
raising her flair for music, games, plays, and vivid speech to an
ecstasy of poems, madrigals, dramas, and masques, and such prose as
England has never known again. In her palaces at Whitehall, Windsor,
Greenwich, Rich- mond, and Hampton Court lords and ladies, knights and
ambassadors, en- tertainers and servitors moved in an exciting
alternation of regal ceremony and gallant gaiety. A special Office of
the Revels prepared amusements that ranged from “riddles” and backgammon
to complex masques and Shake - speare’s plays. Ascension Day, Christmas,
New Year’s, Twelfth Night, Candlemas, and Shrovetide were regularly
celebrated with pastimes, athletic contests, jousts, mummings, plays,
and masques. The masque was one of many Italian importations into
Elizabethan England — a gaudy mix-</p>
<p>14 the age of reason begins (chap. I</p>
<p>ture of pageantry, poetry, music, allegory, buffoonery, and ballet,
put together by playwrights and artists, presented at court, or on rich
estates, with complex machinery and evolutions, and performed by masked
ladies and gentlemen burdened with costly costumes and simple lines.
Elizabeth was fond of drama, especially of comedy; who knows how much
of</p>
<p>Shakespeare would have reached the stage, or posterity, if she and
Leicester had not supported the theater through all the attacks of the
Puritans?</p>
<p>Not content with her five palaces, Elizabeth sallied out almost every
summer on cross- country “progresses” to see and be seen, to keep an eye
on her vassal lords, and to enjoy their reluctant homage. Part of the
court followed her, delighted with the change and grumbling at the
accom- modations and the beer. Towns dressed their gentry in velvet and
silk to welcome her with speeches and gifts; nobles bankrupted
themselves to entertain her; hard-pressed lords prayed that she would
not come their way. The Queen rode on horseback or in an open litter,
greeting happily the crowds that gathered along the road. The people
were thrilled by the sight of their invincible sovereign, and bewitched
to fresh loyalty by her gracious compliments and infectious
happiness.</p>
<p>The court took on her gaiety, her freedom of manners, her luxury of
dress, her love of ceremony, and her ideal of the gentleman. She liked
to hear the rustle of finery, and the men around her rivaled the women
in molding Oriental stuffs to Italian styles. Pleasure was the usual
program, but one had to be ready at any moment for martial exploits
beyond the seas. Seductions had to be circumspect, for Elizabeth felt
responsible to the parents of her maids of honor for their honor; hence
she banished the Earl of Pembroke from the court for making Mary Fitton
pregnant.®® As at any court, intrigue wove many entangling webs; the
women competed unscrupulously for the men, the men for the women, and
all for the favor of the Queen and the perquisites dependent thereon.
Those same gentlemen who exalted in poetry the refinements of love and
morality itched in prose for sinecures, took or gave bribes, grasped at
monopolies, or shared in piratical spoils; and the avid Queen looked
indulgently upon a venality that eked out the inadequate pay of her
servitors. Through her grants, or by her permission, Leicester became
the richest lord in England; Sir Philip Sidney received vast tracts in
America; Raleigh acquired forty thousand acres in Ireland; the second Ea
rl of Essex enjoyed a “corner” on the importation of sweet wines; and
Sir Christopher Hatton rose from the Queen’s lapdog to Lord Chancellor.
Elizabeth was no more sensitive to industrious brains than to handsome
legs — for these pillars of society were not yet shrouded in pantaloons.
Despite her faults she set a pace and a course to elicit the reserve
energies of England’s worthies; she raised their</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>grace and wit and the fostering of poetry, drama, and art. Around
that dazzling court and woman gathered nearly all the genius of
England’s greatest age.</p>
<p>V. ELIZABETH AND RELIGION</p>
<p>But within the court, and through the nation, the bitter battle of
the Reformation raged, and created a problem that many thought would
baffle and destroy the Queen. She was a Protestant; the country was
two-thirds, perhaps three-quarters. Catholic.®® Most of the magistrates,
all of the clergy, were Catholic. The Protestants were confined to the
southern ports and industrial towns; they were predominant in London,
where their number was swelled by refugees from oppression on the
Continent; but in the northern and western counties — almost entirely
agricultural — ^they were a negligible few.^® The spirit of the
Protestants, however, was im- measurably more ardent than the Catholic.
In 1559 John Foxe published his Kerwn in ecclesia gestarwn . . .
commentarii^ describing with passion the sufferings of Protestants under
the preceding reign; the volumes were translated (1563) as Actes and
Monuments; popularly known as The Book of Martyrs, they had an arousing
influence on English Protestants for over a century. Protestantism in
the sixteenth century had the feverish energy of a new idea fighting for
the future; Catholicism had the strength of traditional beliefs and ways
deeply rooted in the past.</p>
<p>In a spreading minority the religious turmoil had generated
skepticism — even, here and there, atheism. The conflict of creeds,
their mutual criticism, their bloody intolerance, and the contrast
between the professions and the conduct of Christians, had made some
matter-of-fact minds doubtful of all theologies. Hear Roger Ascham’s
Scholema ster (1563):</p>
<p>That Italian that first invented the Italian Proverb against our</p>
<p>Englishmen Italianate, meant no more their vanity in living than
their lewd opinion in Religion . . . They make more account of
Tully’s</p>
<p>offices 〔Cicero’s De officiis〕 than St. Paul’s epistles; of a tale
in Boc -</p>
<p>caccio than a story of the Bible. Then they count as fables the
holy</p>
<p>mysteries of the Christian Religion. They make Christ and his Gospel
only serve civil policy; then neither religion 〔Protestantism or</p>
<p>Catholicism〕 cometh amiss to them. In time they be promoters of</p>
<p>both openly; in place again mockers of both privily . . . For
where</p>
<p>they dare, in company where they like, they boldly laugh to scorn</p>
<p>both Protestant and Papist. They care for no Scripture . . . they
mock the Pope; they rail on Luther . . . The heaven they desire is only
their personal pleasure and private profit; whereby they plainly declare
of</p>
<p>i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>whose school . . . they be: that is, Epicures in living, and atheoi
in</p>
<p>doctrine.“*^</p>
<p>Cecil complained (1569) that “deriders of religion. Epicureans,
and</p>
<p>atheists are everywhere”;^® John Strype declared (1571) that “many
were</p>
<p>divinity of Christ.’*® Several dramatists — Greene, Kyd, Marlowe —
^were reputed atheists. The Elizabethan drama, which otherwise so widely
pictures life, contains remarkably little about the strife of faiths,
but makes a great play of pagan mythology.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare’s Love’s Labour’s Lost (IV, iii, 250) are two
obscure</p>
<p>lines:</p>
<p>O paradox! black is the badge of hell.</p>
<p>The hue of dungeons and the school of night.</p>
<p>Many^® have interpreted the last phrase as referring to the evening
as- semblies of Walter Raleigh, the astronomer Thomas Harriot, the
scholar Lawrence Keymis, probably the poets Marlowe and Chapman, and
some others, in Raleigh’s country house at Sherborne, for the study of
astron - omy, geography, chemistry, philosophy, and theology. Harriot,
apparently the intellectual leader of the group, “had strange thoughts
of the Scrip- tures,” reported the antiquary Anthony a Wood, “and always
undervalued the old story of the creation . . . He made a Philosophical
Theology,</p>
<p>wherein he cast off the Old Testament”; he believed in God, but re
-</p>
<p>jected revelation and the divinity of Christ. Robert Parsons, the
Jesuit, wrote in 1 592 of “Sir Walter Rawleigh’s school of Atheisme . .
. wherein both Moyses and our Saviour, the olde and Newe Testamentes are
jested at, and the schollers taught … to spell God backwards.”** Raleigh
was accused of having listened to Marlowe’s reading of an essay on
“atheism.” In March 1594 a government commission sat at Cerne Abbes,
Dorset, to investigate rumors of a set of atheists in the vicinity —
which included Raleigh’s home. The inquiry led to no action now known to
us, but</p>
<p>charges of atheism were brought against Raleigh during his trial
(1603).’’“ In the preface to his History of the W orld he made it a
point to enlarge upon his belief in God.</p>
<p>Some suspicion of freethinking clings to E lizabeth herself. “No

<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>said John Richard Green, “ever lived who was so totally destitute of
the sentiment of religion.”®® “Elizabeth,” in Froude’s judgment, “was
without distinct emotional conviction . . . Elizabeth, to whom the
Protestant creed was as little true as the Catholic . . . had a
latitudinarian contempt for theological dogmatism.”®^ She called upon
God — with terrible oaths that horrified her ministers — to destroy her
if she did not keep her promise to marry Alengon, while in private she
jested over his pretensions to her hand.®^ She declared to a Spanish
envoy that the difference between the warring Christian creeds was “a
mere bagatelle” — whereupon he con- cluded that she was an
atheist.®*</p>
<p>Nevertheless she took it for granted, like almost all governments
before 1789, that some religion, some supernatural source and sanction
of moral- ity, was indispensable to social order and the stability of
the state. For a time, till she had consolidated her position, she
appeared to hesitate, and she played upon the hopes of Catholic
potentates that she might be won to their public faith. She liked the
Catholic ceremony, the celibacy of the clergy, the drama of the Mass,
and she might have made her peace with the Church had not this involved
submission to the papacy. She distrusted Catholicism as a foreign power
that might lead Englishmen to put loyalty to the Church above allegiance
to the Queen. She had been reared in the Protestantism of her father,
which was Catholicism minus the papacy; and this is essentially what she
decided to re-establish in England. She hoped that the semi-Catholic
liturgy of her Anglican Church would mollify the Catholics of the
countryside, while the rejection of the papacy would satisfy the
Protestants of the towns; meanwhile state control of education would
form the new generation to this Elizabethan settlement, and the
disruptive religious strife would be quieted into peace. She made her
hesitations in religion, as in marriage, serve her political purposes;
she kept potential enemies bemused and divided until she could face them
with an accomplished fact.</p>
<p>Many forces urged her to complete the Reformation. Continental re-
formers wrote to thank her in advance for restoring the new worship, and
their letters touched her. Holders of formerly Church property</p>
<p>prayed for a Protestant settlement. Cecil urged Elizabeth to make
herself the leader of all Protestant Europe. London Protestants
indicated their sentiments by beheading a statue of St. Thomas and
casting it into the street. Her first Parliament (January 23 to May 8,
1559) was overwhelm- ingly Protestant. The funds she asked for were
voted without reservation or delay, and to raise them a tax was laid
upon all persons, ecclesiastical or secular. A new Act of Uniformity
(April 28, 1559) made Cranmer’s Book of Common Prayer, revised, the law
of English liturgy, and forbade all other religious ritual. The Mass was
abolished. All Englishmen were</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. 1</p>
<p>required to attend the Sunday service of the Anglican Church or
forfeit a shilling for the succor of the poor. A new Act of Supremacy
(April 29) declared Elizabeth to be the Supreme Governor of England in
all matters, spiritual or temporal. An oath of supremacy acknowledging
the religious sovereignty of the Queen was required of all clergymen,
lawyers, teachers, university graduates, and magistrates, and all
employees of the Church or the Crown. All major ecclesiastical
appointments and decisions were to be made by an ecclesiastical Court of
High Commission chosen by the govern- ment. Any defense of papal
authority over England was to be punished by life imprisonment for the
first offense, by death for the second (1563). By 1 590 all English
churches were Protestant.</p>
<p>Elizabeth pretended that she was not persecuting opinion; any man,
she said, might think and believe as he pleased, provided he obeyed the
laws; all she asked was external conformity for the sake of national
unity. Cecil assured her that “that state could never be in safety where
there was toleration of two religions”®^ — which did not deter Elizabeth
from demand- ing toleration of French Protestants in Catholic France.®®
She had no objection to peaceful hypocrisy, but freedom of opinion was
not to be freedom of speech. Preachers who disagreed with her views on
any im- portant subject were silenced or dismissed.®® The laws against
heresy were redefined and enforced; Unitarians and Anabaptists were
outlawed;®^ five heretics were burned during the reign — which .seemed a
modest number in its day.</p>
<p>In 1563 a convocation of theologians defined the new creed. All were
agreed on predestination; God of His own free will, before the creation
of the world, and without regard to individual human merit or demerit,
had chosen some of mankind to be elect and saved, leaving all the rest
to be reprobate and damned. They accepted Lutheran justification (sal-
vation) by faith — that is, the elect were saved not by their good works
but by belief in the grace of God and the redeeming blood of Christ;
however, they interpreted the Eucharist in Calvin’s sense as a
spiritual, rather than a physical, communion with Christ. By an act of
Parliament (1566) the “Thirty - nine Articles” embodying the new
theology were</p>
<p>made obligatory on all the clergy of England; and they still express
the official Anglican creed.</p>
<p>The new ritual too was a compromise. The Mass was abolished, but, to
the horror of the Puritans, the clergy were instructed to wear white
surplices in reading the service, and copes in administering the
Eucharist. Communion was to be received kneeling, in the two forms of
bread and wine. The invocation of saints was replaced by annual
commemoration of Protestant heroes. Confirmation and ordination were
retained as sacred rites, but were not viewed as sacraments instituted
by Christ; and con-</p>

<p>fession to a priest was encouraged only in expectation of death. Many
of the prayers kept Roman Catholic forms, but took on English dress and
became a noble and formative part of the nation’s literature. For four
hundred years those prayers and hymns, recited by congregation and
priest in the spacious splendor of cathedrals or the simple dignity of
the parish church, have given English families inspiration, consolation,
moral discipline, and mental peace.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ELIZABETH AND THE CATHOLICS</li>
</ol>
<p>It was now the turn of the Catholics to suffer persecution. Though
still in the majority, they were forbidden to hold Catholic services or
possess Catholic literature. Religious images in the churches were
destroyed by government order, and altars were removed. Six Oxford
students were sent to the Tower for resisting the removal of a crucifix
from their col- lege chapel.’“’® Most Catholics submitted sadly to the
new regulations, but a considerable number preferred to pay the fines
for nonattendance at the Anglican ritual. The royal Council calculated
some fifty thousand such “recusants” in England (1580).®® Anglican
bishops complained to the gov - ernment that Mass was being said in
private homes, that Catholicism was emerging into public worship, and
that in some ardent localities it was unsafe to be a Protestant.®®
Elizabeth rebuked Archbishop Parker for laxity (1565), and thereafter
the laws were more rigorously enforced. Catholics who had heard A’lass
in the chapel of the Spanish ambassador were imprisoned; houses in
London were searched; strangers found there were ordered to give an
account of their religion; magistrates were com- manded to punish all
persons possessing books of Roman Catholic theology</p>
<p>(1567)-®“</p>
<p>We must not judge this legislation in terms of the relative
religious</p>
<p>toleration earned for us by the philosophers and revolutions of the
seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries. The faiths were then at war, and
were entangled with politics — a field in which toleration has always
been limited. All parties and governments in the sixteenth century
agreed that theological dissent was a form of political revolt. The
religious conflict be- came explicitly political when Pope Pius V, after
what he felt had been a long and patient delay, issued a bull (1570)
that not only excommuni- cated Elizabeth, but absolved her subjects from
allegiance to her, and for- bade them “to obey her monitions, mandates,
and laws.” Th e bull was ’juppressed in France and Spain, which were
then seeking friendship with England, but a copy of it was clandestinely
posted on the door of the episcopal residence in London. The culprit was
discovered and was put</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>to death. Faced by this declaration of war, the Queen’s ministers
asked Parliament for stricter anti-Catholic laws. Statutes were passed
making it a capital crime to call the Queen a heretic, schismatic,
usurper, or tyrant, or to introduce a papal bull into England, or to
convert a</p>
<p>Protestant to the Roman Church.®- The Court of High Commission was
authorized to examine the opinions of any suspected person and to punish
any of his unpunished offenses against any law, including fornication or
adultery.*®</p>
<p>The Catholic monarchs of Europe could not with much face protest</p>
<p>against these oppressive measures, which so resembled their own. Most
English Catholics continued to submit peaceably, and Elizabeth’s govern
- ment hoped that habit would generate acceptance, and, in time, belief.
It was to prevent this that William Allen, an emigre Englishman, founded
at Douai, then in the Spanish Netherlands, a college and seminary to
train English Catholics for missionary service in England. He expounded
his purpose fervently:</p>
<p>We make it our first and foremost study … to stir up … in the</p>
<p>minds of Catholics . . . zeal and just indignation against the
heretics.</p>
<p>This we do by setting before the eyes of the students the exceeding
majesty of the ceremonial of the Catholic Church in the place where we
live … At the same time we recall the mournful contrast that</p>
<p>obtains at home: the utter desolation of all things sacred which
there exists . . . our friends and kinsfolk, all our dear ones, and
countless</p>
<p>souls besides, perishing in schism and godlessness; every jail
and</p>
<p>dungeon filled to overflowing, not with thieves and villains but with
Christ’s priests and se rvants, nay, with our parents and kinsmen.</p>
<p>There is nothing, then, that we ought not to suffer, rather than
to</p>
<p>look on at the ills that affect our nation.®^</p>
<p>The college functioned at Douai till 1578, when the Calvinists
captured the town; then at Reims, then again at Douai (1593). The Douay
Bible — an English translation of the Latin Vulgate — was produced at
Reims and Douai (1582-1610), and reached publication a year before the
King</p>
<p>James version. Between 1574 and 1585 the college ordained 275
graduates and sent 268 to labor in England. Allen was called to Rome and
made a cardinal, but the work went on; 170 additional priests were
dispatched to England before Elizabeth’s death in 1603. Of the 438
total, ninety -eight suffered the capital penalty.</p>
<p>The leadership of the missionaries passed to a Jesuit, Robert
Parsons, a man of enthusiasm and courage, a firebrand of polemics, and a
master of English prose. He frankly announced that the bull deposing
Elizabeth justified her assassination. Many English Catholics were
shocked, but</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Tolomeo Galli, secretary of state to Pope Gregory XIII, gave the idea
his approval.*”® Parsons urged the Catholic powers to invade England;
the Spanish ambassador in England condemned the plan as “criminal
folly,” and Everard Mercurian, general of the Jesuit order, forbade
Parsons to meddle in politics.®^ Undeterred, he decided on a personal
invasion. He disguised himself as an English officer returning from
service in the</p>
<p>Netherlands; his martial swagger, gold-lace coat, and feathered hat
carried him through the frontier officials (1580); he even smoothed the
way for another Jesuit, Edmund Campion, to follow him in the guise of
a</p>
<p>jewel merchant. They were secretly housed in the heart of London.</p>
<p>They visited imprisoned Catholics, and found them leniently treated.
Recruiting lay and sacerdotal aides, they began their work of inspiring
Catholics to remain faithful to the Church, and reconve rting recent
“apos - tates” to the Protestant creed. Secular priests hiding in
England, alarmed at the boldness of the missionaries, warned them that
they would soon be caught and arrested, and that their detection would
make matters worse for the Catholics, and they begged them to return to
the Continent. But Parsons and Campion persisted. They moved from town
to town, holding secret assemblies, hearing confessions, saying Mass,
and giving their benediction to the whispering worshipers who looked
upon them as messengers from God. Within a year of their coming they
made — it was claimed — twenty thousand converts.®” They set up a
printing press and scattered propaganda; tracts declaring that
Elizabeth, having been ex- communicated, was no longer the lawful queen
of England were found in London streets.®® A third Jesuit was sent to
Edinburgh to urge the Scottish Catholics to invade England from the
north. The Earl of Westmorland answered a summons from the Vatican; he
brought back from Rome to Flanders a mass of bullion to finance an
invasion from the Netherlands; by the summer of 1581, many Catholics
believed, the Spanish troops of Alva would cross into England.^®</p>
<p>Warned by its spies, the English government doubled its efforts
to</p>
<p>capture the Jesuits. Parsons found his way across the Channel, but
Campion was caught (July 1581). He was carried through sympathetic
villages and hostile London to the Tower. Elizabeth sent for him and
tried to save him. She asked. Did he consider her his lawful sovereign?
He replied that he did. But to her next question. Could the Pope
lawfully excommuni- cate her?, he answered that he could not decide an
issue on which learned men were divided. She sent him back to the Tower,
with instructions that</p>

view.”®®</li>

<p>he be kindly treated; but Cecil ordered him to be tortured into
naming his fellow conspirators. After two days of agony he yielded a few
names, and more arrests were made. Recovering his audacity, Campion
chal- lenged Protestant divines to a public debate. By permission of the
Council a debate was staged in the chapel of the Tower; courtiers,
prisoners, and public were admitted; and the Jesuit stood for hours on
weakened legs to plead for the Catholic theology. Neither side convinced
the other; but when Campion was brought to trial the charge was not
heresy but</p>
<p>conspiracy to overthrow the government by internal subversion and ex-
ternal attack. He and fourteen others were convicted, and on December I,
1581, they were hanged.</p>
<p>Those Catholics proved right who had predicted that the Jesuit
mission would exasperate the government into further persecution.
Elizabeth issued an appeal to her subjects to judge between her and
those who sought her tbrone or her life. Parliament decreed (1581) that
conversion to Catholicism should be punished as high treason; that any
priest who said Mass should be fined two hundred marks and be imprisoned
for a year; and that those who refused to attend Anglican services
should pay twenty pounds a month^^ — enough to bankrupt any but the
richest Catholics. Failure to pay the fine incurred arrest and
confiscation of property. Soon the prisons were so crowded with
Catholics that old castles had to be used as jails.’’^ Tension rose on
all sides, heightened by the imminent execution</p>
<p>vasion of England by three armies at once from Ireland, France, and
Spain. The Pope gave sympathetic consideration to this disegno per
Vimpresa (Vlnghilterra and specific measures were prepared;^* but
English spies got wind of them, England made counterpreparations, and
the in- vasion was postponed.</p>
<p>Parliament retaliated with more repressive legislation. All priests
or- dained since June 1559 and still refusing the oath of supremacy were
re- quired to leave the country within forty days or suffer death as
treasonous conspirators; and all who harbored them were to be hanged.’^
On the basis of this and other laws, 123 priests and sixty laymen were
executed during the reign of Elizabeth, and probably another two hundred
died in jail.’’® Some Protestants protested against the severity of this
legislation; some were converted to Catholicism; Cecil’s grandson
William fled to Rome (1585) and pledged obedience to the Pope.^®</p>
<p>Most English Catholics were opposed to any violent action against the
government. One faction among them addressed an appeal to Elizabeth
(1585), affirmed their loyalty, and asked for “a merciful consideration
of their sufferings.” But as if to bear out the government’s claim that
its</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>measures were justified by war, Cardinal Allen issued (1588) a tract
de- signed to rouse the English Catholics to support the approaching
attack on England by Spain. He called the Queen “an incestuous bastard,
be - gotten and bom in sin of an infamous courtesan,” charged that “with
Leices - ter and divers others she hath abused her body … by unspeakable
and incredible variety of lust,” demand ed that the Catholics of England
should rise against this “depraved, accursed, excommunicate heretic,”
and prom - ised a plenary indulgence to all who should aid in deposing
the “chief spectacle of sin and abomination in this age.”*^^ The
Catholics of En gland answered by fighting as bravely as the Protestants
against the Spanish Armada.</p>
<p>After that victory the persecution continued as part of the
continuing war. Sixty-one priests and forty-nine laymen w^ere hanged
between 1588 and 1603; and many of these were cut down from the gibbet
and were drawn and quartered — i.e., they were disemboweled and torn
limb from trunk — ^while still alive.’^^ In a remarkable address
presented to the Queen in the year of her death, thirteen priests
petitioned her to be allowed to remain in England. They repudiated all
attacks on her right to the</p>
<p>throne and denied the authority of the Pope to depose her, but could
not in conscience acknowledge anyone but the Pope as head of the
Christian ChurchJ® The document reached the Queen only a few days before
her death, and no result of it is recorded; but unwittingly it outlined
the prin- ciples on which, two centuries later, the problem would be
solved. The Queen died a victor in the greatest struggle of a reign
stained with no darker blot than this victory.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ELIZABETH AND THE PURITANS</li>
</ol>
<p>Against an apparently weaker enemy, a handful of Puritans, she did
not prevail. They were men who had felt the influence of Calvin; some of
them had visit ed Calvin’s Geneva as Marian refugees; many of them had
read the Bible in a translation made and annotated by Genevan
Calvinists; some had heard or read the blasts of John Knox’s trumpet;
some may have heard echoes of Wyclif’s Lollard “poor priests.” Ta king
the Bible as their infallible guide, they found nothing in it about the
episcopal powers and sacerdotal vestments that Elizabeth had transferred
from the Roman to the Anglican Church; on the contrary, they found much
about presbyters’ having no sovereign but Christ. They acknowledged
Elizabeth as head of the Church in England, but only to bar the pope; in
their hearts they re- jected any control of religion by the state, and
aspired to control of the state by their religion. Toward 1564 they
began to be called Puritans — as</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. 1</p>
<p>a term of abuse — because they demanded the purification of English
Protestantism from all forms of faith and worship not found in the New
Testament. They took the doctrines of predestination, election, and dam-
nation deeply to heart, and felt that hell could be escaped only by sub-
ordinating every aspect of life to religion and morality. As they read
the Bible in the solemn Sundays of their homes, the figure of Christ
almost disappeared against the background of the Old Testament’s jealous
and vengeful Jehovah.</p>
<p>The Puritan attack on Elizabeth took form (1569) when the
lectures</p>
<p>of Thomas Cartwright, professor of theology at Cambridge, stressed
the contrast between the presbyter-ian organization of the early
Christian Church and the episcopal-ian structure of the Anglican
Establishment. Many of the faculty supported Cartwright, but John
Whitgift, headmaster of Trinity College, denounced him to the Queen and
secured his dismissal from the teaching staff (1570). Cartwright
emigrated to Geneva, where, under Theodore de Beze, he imbibed the full
ardor of Calvinist theocracy. Returning to England, he shared with
Walter Travers and others in formu- lating the Puritan conception of the
Church. Christ, in their view, had arranged that all ecclesiastical
authority should be vested in ministers and lay elders elected by each
parish, province, and state. The consistories so formed should determine
creed, ritual, and moral code in conformity with Scripture. They should
have access to every home, power to enforce at least outward observance
of “godly living,” and the right to exco mmunicate recalcitrants and
condemn heretics to death. The civil magistrates were to carry out these
disciplinary decrees, but the state was to have no spiritual
jurisdiction whatever.®®</p>
<p>The first English parish organized on these principles was set up
at</p>
<p>Wandsworth in 1572, and similar “presbyteries” sprang up in the
eastern</p>
<p>But Elizabeth felt that the Puritan movement threatened the whole</p>
<p>settlement by which she had planned to ease the religious strife. She
thought of Calvinism as the doctrine of John Knox, whom she had
never</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>forgiven for his scorn of women rulers. She despised the Puritan
dogmatism even more heartily than the Catholic. She had a lingering
fondness for the crucifix and other religious images, and when an
iconoclastic fury destroyed paintings, .statuary, and stained glass
early in her reign,®^ she awarded damages to the victims and forbade
such actions in the future.®® She was not finicky in her own language,
but she resented the description which some Puritan had given of the
Prayer Book as “culled and picked out of that popish dunghill, the A 4
ass Book,” and of the Court of High Commission as a “little stinking
ditch.”®* She saw in the popular e lection of ministers, and in the
government of the Church by presbyteries and synods independent of the
state, a republican threat to monarchy. Only her monarchical power, she
thought, could keep England Protestant; popular suffrage would restore
Catholicism.</p>
<p>She encouraged bishops to trouble the troublemakers. Archbishop</p>
<p>Parker suppressed their publications, silenced them in the churches,
and obstructed their assemblies. Puritan clergymen had organized groups
for the public discussion of Scriptural passages; Elizabeth bade Parker
put an end to these “prophesyings”; he did. His successor, Edmund
Grindal, tried to protect the Puritans; Elizabeth suspended him; and
when he died (1583) she advanced to the Canterbury see her new chaplain,
John Whit- gift, who dedicated himself to the silencing of the Puritans.
He demanded of all English clergymen an oath accepting the Thirty-nine
Articles, the Prayer Book, and tbe Queen’s religious supremacy; he
subpoenaed all ob - jectors before the High Commission Court; and there
they were subjected to such detailed and insistent inquiry into their
conduct and belief that Cecil compared the procedure to the Spanish
Inquisition.®®</p>
<p>The Puritan rebellion was intensified. A determined minority openly
seceded from the Anglican communion, and set up independent congre-
gations that elected their own ministers and acknowledged no episcopal
control. In 1581 Robert Browne, a pupil (later an enemy) of Cartwright,
and chief voice of these “Independents,” “Separatists,” or
“Congregational - ists,” crossed over to Holland, and he published there
two tracts outlining a democratic constitution for Christianity. Any
group of Christians should have the right to organize itself for
worship, formulate its own creed on the basis of Scripture, choose its
own leaders, and live its religious life free from outside interference,
acknowledging no rule but the Bible, no</p>
<p>authority but Christ. Two of Browne’s followers were arrested in Eng
- land, were judged in contempt of the Queen’s religious sovereignty,
and were hanged (1583).</p>
<p>In the campaign for election to the Parliament of 1586 the
Puritans</p>
<p>waged oratorical war upon any candidate unsympathetic to their cause.
One such was branded as a “common gamester and pot companion”; an -</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Other was “much suspect of popery, cometh very seldom to his church,
and is a whoremaster”; those were days of virile speech. When Parliam
ent convened, John Penry presented a petition for reform of the Church,
and charged the bishops with responsibility for clerical abuses and
popular paganism. Whitgift ordered his arrest, but he was soon released.
Antony Cope introduced a bill to abolish the entire episcopal
establishment and reorganize English Christianity on the presbyterian
plan. Elizabeth ordered Parliament to remove the bill from discussion.
Peter Wentworth rose to a question of parliamentary freedom, and four
members supported him; Elizabeth had all five lodged in the Tower.</p>
<p>Frustrated in Parliament, Penry and other Puritans took to the press.
Eluding Whitgift’s severe censorship of publications, they deluged Eng -
land (1588-89) with a succession of privately printed pamphlets, all</p>
<p>signed “Martin Marprelate, Gentleman,” and attacking the authority
and personal character of the bishops in terms of satirical abuse.
Whitgift and the High Commission deployed all the machinery of espionage
to find the authors and printers; but the printers moved from town to
town, and public sympathy helped them to escape detection until April
1589. Pro- fessional writers like John Lyly and Thomas Nash were engaged
to</p>
<p>answer “Martin” and gave him good competition in scurrility. Finally,
as billingsgate ran out, the controversy subsided, and moderate men
mourned the degradation of Christianity into an art of vituperation.</p>
<p>Stung by these pamphlets, Elizabeth gave Whitgift a free hand to</p>
<p>check the Puritans. The A^arprelate printers were found, arrests
multi- plied, executions followed. Cartwright was sentenced to death,
but was pardoned by the Queen. Two leaders of the “Brownian Movement,”
John Greenwood and Henry Barrow, were hanged in 1593, and soon
thereafter John Penry. Parliament decreed (1593) that anyone who
questioned the Queen’s religious supremacy, or persistently absented
himself from Angli - can services, or attended “any assemblies,
conventicles, or meetings under cover or pretense of any exercise o f
religion” should be imprisoned and — unless he gave a pledge of future
conformity — ^should leave England and never return, on pain of
death.**</p>
<p>At this juncture, and amid the turmoil and fury, a modest parson</p>
<p>raised the controversy to the level of philosophy, piety, and stately
prose. Richard Hooker was one of two clergymen assigned to conduct
services in the London Temple; the other was AValter Travers,
Cartwright’s friend. In the morning sermon Hooker expounded the
ecclesiastical polity of Eliza- beth; in the afternoon Travers
criticized that church government from the Puritan view. Each developed
his sermons into a book. As Hooker was writing literature as well as
theology, he begged his bishop to transfer him to a quiet rural
parsonage. So at Boscombe in Wiltshire he completed</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>the first four books of his great work Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical
Polity (1594); three years later, at Bishopsbourne, he sent Book V to
the press; and there, in 1600, age forty-seven, he died.</p>
<p>His Laws astonished England by the calm and even-tempered dignity of
its argument and the sonorous majesty of its almost Latin style.
Cardinal Allen praised it as the best book that had yet come out of
England; Pope Clement VllI lauded its eloquence and learning; Queen
Elizabeth read it</p>
<p>gratefully as a splendid apology for her religious government; the
Puritans were mollified by the gentle clarity of its tone; and posterity
received it as a noble attempt to harmonize religion and reason. Hooker
astonished his contemporaries by admitting that even a pope could be
saved; he shocked the theologians by declaring that “the assurance of
what we believe by the Word of God is to us not so certain as that which
we perceive by sense”;®^ man’s reasoning faculty is also a divine gift
and revelation.</p>
<p>Hooker based his theory of law on medieval philosophy as formulated
by St. Thomas Aquinas, and he anticipated the “social contract” of
Hobbes and Locke. After showing the need and boon of social
organization, he argued that voluntary participation in a society
implies consent to be governed by its laws. But tlie ultimate source of
the laws is the com- munity itself: a king or a parliament may issue
laws only as the delegate or representatives of the community. “Law
makes the king; the king’s grant of any favor contrary to the law is
void … For peaceable contentment on both sides, the assent of those who
are governed seemeth necessary . . . Laws are not which public
approbation has not made so.”®® And Hooker added a passage that might
have warned Charles I:</p>
<p>The Parliament of England, together with the 〔ecclesiastical〕
Con-</p>
<p>vocation annexed thereunto, is that whereupon the very essence of all
government within this kingdom doth depend; it is even the body of the
whole realm; it consisteth of the king and of all that within the</p>
<p>land are subject to him, for they are all there present, either in
person, or by such as they voluntarily have derived 〔delegated〕 their
power</p>
<p>unto.®*</p>
<p>To Hooker religion seemed an integral part of the state, for
social</p>
<p>order and therefore even material prosperity depend on moral
discipline, which collapses without religious inculcation and support.
Consequently every state should provide religious training for its
people. The Anglican Church might be imperfect, but so would be all
institutions made and manned by the children of Adam. “He that goeth
about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well off as they
ought to be, shall never want attentive and favorable hearers; because
they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regiment
〔government〕 is subject, but</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>the secret lets and difficulties, which in public proceedings are
innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment to
consider.”®® Hooker’s logic was too circular to be convincing, his
learning too schol - astic to meet the issues of his time, his shy
spirit too thankful for order to understand the longing for liberty. The
Puritans acknowledged his eloquence, but went on their way. Compelled to
choose between their country and their faith, many of them emigrated,
reversing the movement of Continental Protestants into England. Holland
welcomed them, and English congregations rose at Middelburg, Leiden, and
Amsterdam. There the exiles and their offspring labored, taught,
preached, and wrote,</p>
<p>preparing with quiet passion for their triumphs in England and their
fulfillment in America.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>ELIZABETH AND IRELAND</li>
</ol>
<p>Ireland had been conquered by the English in 1169-71, and had been
held ever since on the ground that otherwise it would be used by France
or Spain as a base for attacks on England. At Elizabeth’s accession
direct English rule in Ireland was confined to the eastern coast — “the
Pale” — around and south of Dublin; the rest of the island was governed
by Irish chieftains only nominally acknowledging English sovereignty.
The perennial conflict with the English, disrupted the tribal
administration that had given Ireland chaos and violence,, but also
poets, scholars, and saints. Most of the land was left to woods and
bogs; transport and communication were heroic enterprises, and the
native Celtic population of some 800,000 souls lived in a half-lawless
misery on the edge of barbarism. The English in the Pale were almost as
poor, and they made Elizabeth’s problem worse by debauchery, peculation,
and c rime; they robbed the London government as sedulously as they
plundered the Irish peasantry. Throughout the reign English settlers
drove Irish proprietors and tenants from “clearances”; the dispossessed
fought back with assassinations; and life for conquerors and conquered
alike became a persisting fever of force and hate.. Cecil himself
thought that “the Flemings had not such cause to rebel against the
oppression of the Spaniards” as the Irish against English rule.®^</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s Irish policy was ba sed on the conviction that a Catholic
Ireland would be a peril to a Protestant England. She ordered a full
enforcement of Protestantism throughout the island. Mass was prohibited,
the monasteries were closed; public worship ceased outside the narrow
Pale. Priests survived in hiding, and administered the sacraments
furtively to a few. Morality, deprived of both religion and peace,
almost disappeared; murder, theft, adultery, and rape flourished, and
men changed wives without grudge or qualm. Irish leaders appealed to the
popes and Philip II for protection or aid. Philip feared to invade
Ireland, lest the English should invade and help the rebellious Nether-
lands, but he established centers and colleges for Irish refugees in
Spain. Pius IV sent to Ireland an Irish Jesuit, David Wolfe (1560); with
the courage</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>and devotion characteristic of his order, Wolfe established
clandestine missions, brought in other disguised Jesuits, and restored
Catholic piety and hope. The chieftains took heart, and one after
another rose in revolt against English rule.</p>
<p>The most powerful of them was Shane (i.e., John) O’Neill of Tyrone.
Here was such a man as legend could sing of and Irishmen could fight
for. He fiercely defended his title of the O’Neill against a usurping
brother. He ignored the Commandments and adored the Church. He foiled
all English efforts to subdue him, risked his head to visit London and
win Elizabeth’s alliance and support, and returned in triumph to rule
Ulster as well as Tyrone. He fought the rival O’Donnell clan
ferociously, was finally defeated by it (1567), and was killed when he
took refuge with the MacDonnells, Scottish immigrants whose settlement
at Antrim he had formerly attacked.</p>
<p>The history of Ireland after his death was a parade of rebellions,
massacres, and lords deputy. Sir Henry Sidney, father of Sir Philip,
served Elizabeth faithfully in that ungrateful office for nine years. He
joined in defeating O’Neill, hunted Rory O’More to the death, and was
recalled (1578) because of the high cost of his victories. In two years
as Lord Deputy, Walter Devereux, first Earl of Essex, distinguished
himself by a massacre on the island of Rathlin, off the Antrim coast.
Thither the rebel MacDonnells had sent for safety their wives and
children, their aged and ailing, with a protective guard. Essex dis-
patched a force to capture the island. The garrison offered to surrender
if they might be allowed to sail for Scotland; the offer was refused;
they surrendered unconditionally; they and the women and children, the
sick and the old, num- bering six hundred, were put to the sword
(1575).<sup>’</sup></p>
<p>The great revolt of the reign was that of the Geraldine clan in
Munster. After many captivities and escapes, James Fitzmaurice
Fitzgerald crossed to the Continent, raised a troop of Spaniards,
Italians, Portuguese, Flemings, and English Catholic emigres, and landed
them on the coast of Kerry (1579), only to lose his life in an
incidental war with another clan. His cousin Gerald Fitzgerald,
fifteentli Earl of Desmond, carried on the revolt, but the neighboring
Butler clan, under the Protestant Earl of Ormonde, declared for England.
The Catholics of the Pale organized an army and defeated the levies of
the new Lord Deputy, Arthur, Lord Grey (1580). Reinforced, Grey beseiged
Desmond’s main force by land and sea on a promontory in Smerwick Bay.
Finding them- selves defenseless against Grey’s artillery, the six
hundred surviving rebels sur - rendered and begged for mercy; all were
slaughtered, women and men, except for officers who could promise
substantial ransoms.®^ The war of English against Irish, and of clan
against clan, so ravaged Munster that (said an Irish chronicler) “the
lowing of a cow, or the voice of a plowman, was not to be heard that
year from Dingle to the Rock of Cashel”; and an Englishman wrote (1582)
that “there hat h died by famine . . . thirty thousand in Munster in
less than half a year, besides others that are hanged and killed.”®^ For
“to kill an Irishman in that province,” wrote a great English historian,
“was thought no more of than to kill a mad dog.”®“’“ A lmost denuded of
Irish, Munster was divided into plantations for English settlers (1586)
— one of them Edmund Spenser, who there completed The Faerie Queene.</p>
<p>The desperate Irish rose again in 1593. Hugh O’Donnell, Lord of
Tyrconnel,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>joined forces with Hugh O’Neill, second Earl of Tyrone. Spain, now at
open war with England, promised help. In an interregnum between lords
deputy, O’Neill routed an English army at Armagh, captured Blackwater,
an English stronghold in the north (1598), and sent a force to renew the
Munster revolt. The English colonists fled, abandoning their
plantations. Hope and joy spread in Ireland, and even the English
expected that Dublin itself would fall.</p>
<p>It was in this crisis that Elizabeth appointed the youthful Robert
Devereux, second Earl of Essex, as her Lord Deputy in Ireland (March
1599). She gave him an army of 17,500 men — the greatest that England
had ever sent to the island. She bade him attac k O’Neill in Tyrone,
make no peace without con - sulting her, and not return without her
permission. Arrived in Dublin, he dallied through the spring, undertook
a few skirmishes, let his army waste away with disease, signed an
unauthorized truce with O’N eill, and returned to England (September
1599) to explain his failure to the Queen. Quickly re- placing him,
Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, faced with courage and skill a
combination of tricky O’Neill, fearless O’Donnell, and a fleet landing
at</p>
<p>Her record in Ireland subtracted from her glory. She underestimated
the difficulty of conquering, in an almost roadless country, a people
whose love of their land and their faith was their only bond to life and
decency. She scolded her deputies for failures that were due in part to
her own parsimony; they were unable to pay their troops, who found it
more profitable to rob the Irish than to fight them. She vacillated
between truce and terror, and never followed one policy to a decision.
She founded Trinity College and Dublin University (1591), but she left
the people of Ireland as illiterate as before. After the ex- penditure
of 10,000,000, the peace achieved was a desert of desolation over half
the lovely isle, and, over all of it, a spirit of unspeakable hatred
that only bided its time to kill and devastate again.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>ELIZABETH AND SPAIN</li>
</ol>
<p>The Queen was at her best in her management of Spain. She allowed
Philip to think she might marry him or his son; and in his hopes of
winning England with a wedding ring, he played the game of patience till
his friends were alienated and Elizabeth was strong. Pope and Emperor
and a hapless Scottish Queen might beg him to invade England, but he was
too doubtful of France, too troubled in the Netherlands, to venture upon
so incalculable a throw of the political dice. He had no assurance that
France would not pounce upon the Spanish Netherlands the moment he
became embroiled with England. He was loath to encourage revolution</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>anywhere. He trusted, in his heavy procrastinating way, that
Elizabeth would in due time find one or another of the many exits that
an ingenious nature has provided from our life; and yet he was in no
haste to give the throne of England to a Scottish lass in love with
France. For years he held back the Pope from promulgating the
excommunication of Eliza- beth. Ele bore in somber silence her treatment
of Catholics in England, and her protests against the treatment of
English Protestants in Spain. For al- most thirty years he kept the
peace while English privateers made war upon Spanish colonies and
trade.</p>
<p>The nature of man confesses itself in the conduct of states, for
these are but ourselves in gross, and behave, for the most part, as men
presumably did before morals and laws were laid upon them by religion
and force. Conscience follows the policeman, but there were no police
for states. On the seas there were no Ten Commandments, and trade
existed by per- mission of piracy. Small pirate craft used the inlets of
the British coast as lairs and thence sallied forth to seize what they
could; if the victims were Spanish the English could enjoy the religious
fervor of plundering a papist. Bold men like John Hawkins and Francis
Drake fitted out sub- stantial privateers and took all the oceans for
their province. Elizabeth disowned but did not disturb them, for she saw
in the privateers the mak- ings of a navy, and in these buccaneers her
future admirals. The Huguenot port of La Rochelle became a favorite
rendezvous of English, Dutch, and Huguenot vessels, which “preyed on
Catholic commerce under whatever</p>
<p>From such piracy the buccaneers passed to that lucrative trade in
slaves which the Portuguese had opened up a century before. In the
Spanish colonies of America the natives were dying out from toil too
arduous for their climate and constitutions. A demand arose for a
sturdier breed of laborers. Las Casas himself, defender of the natives,
suggested to Charles I of Spain that African Negroes, stronger than the
Caribbean Indians, should be transported to America, to do the heavy
work for the Spaniards there.**^ Charles consented, but Philip II
condemned the trade and in- structed the Spanish-American governors to
prevent the importation of slaves except under license — costly and rare
— by the home administra- tion.*® Aware that some governors were evading
these restrictions, Haw- kins led three ships to Africa ( 1 562),
captured three hundred Negroes, took them to the West Indies, and sold
them to Spanish settlers in exchange for sugar, spices, and drugs. Back
in England, he induced Lord Pembroke and others to invest in a second
venture, and persuaded Elizabeth to put one of her best vessels at his
disposal. In 1 564 he headed south with four ships, seized four hundred
African Negroes, sailed for the West Indies, sold them to Spaniards
under threat of his guns if they refused to buy, and returned</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>home to be hailed as a hero and share his spoils with his backers and
the Queen, who made 6o per cent on her investment.®* In 1567 she lent
him her ship the Jesus; with this and four other vessels he sailed to
Africa, captured all the Negroes his holds could stow, sold them in
Spanish</p>
<p>America at ;^i6o a head, and was homeward bound with loot valued at
100,000 when a Spanish fleet caught him off the Mexican coast at San
Juan de Ulua, and destroyed all of his fleet but two small tenders, in
which Hawkins, after a thousand perils, returned empty-handed to England
(1569).</p>
<p>Among the survivors of that voyage was Hawkins’ young kinsman</p>
<p>Francis Drake. Educated at Hawkins’ expense, Drake became, so to
speak, a native of the sea. At twenty- two he commanded a ship on
Hawkins’ futile expedition; at twenty-three, having lost everything but
his reputation for bravery, he vowed vengeance against Spain; at
twenty-five he received a privateer’s commission from Elizabeth. In
1573, aged twenty -eight, he captured a convoy of silver bullion off the
coast of Panama and returned to England rich and revenged. Elizabeth’s
councilors kept him in hiding for three years while Spain cried out for
his death. Then Leicester, Wal- singham, and Hatton fitted out for him
four small vessels, totaling 375 tons; with these he sailed from
Plymouth on November 15, 1577, on what turned out to be the second
circumnavigation of the globe. As his fleet issued from the Straits of
Magellan into the Pacific, it ran into a heavy storm; the ships were
scattered and never reunited; Drake alone, in the Pelican, moved up the
west coast of the Americas to San Francisco, raiding Spanish vessels on
the way. Then he turned boldly westward to the Philip- pines, sailed
through the Moluccas to Java, across the Indian Ocean to Africa, around
the Cape of Good Hope, and up the Atlantic to reach</p>
<p>Plymouth on September 26, 1580, thirty-four months after leaving it.
He brought with him £600,000 of booty, of which 27 5,000 were</p>
<p>handed over to the Queen.^*® England hailed him as the greatest
seaman and pirate of the age. Elizabeth dined on his ship and dubbed
him</p>
<p>knight.</p>
<p>All this time England had been technically at peace with Spain.
Philip lodged repeated protests with the Queen; she made excuses, hugged
her spoils, and pointed out that Philip also was violating international
“law” by sending help to the rebels in Ireland. When the Spanish
ambassador threatened war she threatened marriage with Alengon and
alliance with France. Philip, busy conquering Portugal, ordered his
envoy to keep the peace. As usual, good luck supplemented the
vacillating genius of the Queen. What would have happened to her if
Catholic France had not been cut in two by civil war, if Catholic
Austria and the Emperor had not been harassed by the Turks, if Spain had
not been embroiled with</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Portugal, France, the papacy, and its rebellious subjects in the
Nether- lands?</p>
<p>For years Elizabeth played fast and loose with the Netherlands,
shifting her policy with fluid circumstance, and no charges of
irresolution or treachery could make her move in blinders on one course.
She had no more liking for Dutch Calvinism than for English Puritanism,
and no more liking than Philip for abetting revolution. She recognized
the importance, to the English economy, of uninterrupted trade with the
Netherlands. She planned to support the revolt of the Netherlands
sufficiently to keep them from surrendering to Spain or bequeathing
themselves to France. For as long as the revolt continued Spain would
stay out of England.</p>
<p>A blessed windfall allowed the Queen to help the rebels at a
delectable profit to her treasury. In December 1568 several Spanish
vessels, carrying ^ 1 50,000 to pay Alva’s troops in the Netherlands,
were driven by English privateers into Channel ports. Elizabeth, who had
just heard of Hawkins’ disaster at San Juan de Ulua, recognized a
providential opportunity to make up for what England had lost in that
defeat. She asked Bishop Jewel whether she had a right to the Spanish
treasure; he judged that God, being surely a Protestant, would be
pleased to see the papists plundered. More- over, the Queen learned, the
money had been borrowed by Philip from Genoese bankers, and Philip had
refused to take title to it until its safe delivery in Antwerp.
Elizabeth had the money transferred to her vaults. Philip complained;
Alva seized all English nationals and goods that he could lay hands upon
in the Netherlands; Elizabeth arrested all Spaniards in England. But the
necessities of trade gradually restored normal relations. Alva refused
to prod Elizabeth into alliance with the rebels. Philip kept his temper.
Elizabeth kept the money.</p>
<p>The uneasy peace dragged on until continued English raids on Spanish
shipping, and the appeals of the imprisoned Mary Stuart’s friends,
involved Philip in a plot to assassinate the Queen.<sup>®</sup>
Convinced of his participation, Elizabeth expelled the Spanish
ambassador (1584) and gave open aid to the Netherlands. English troops
entered Flushing, Brill, Ostend, and Sluys; Leicester was sent to
command them; they were defeated by the Spaniards at Zutphen (1586). But
now at last the issue was drawn. Both Philip and Elizabeth prepared with
all their resources for the war that would decide the mastery of the
seas and the religion of England, perhaps of Europe, perhaps of the New
World.</p>
<p>Spain had risen to wealth by grace of Columbus and Pope Alexander VI,
whose arbitration decrees of 1493 had awarded nearly all of the Ameri-
cas to his native Spain. With those voyages and bulls the Mediterranean
ceased to be the center of the white man’s civilization and power, and
the Atlant ic age began. Of Europe’s three great Atlantic nations France
was</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>debarred by civil war from the contest for oceanic dominion. England
and Spain remained, jutting out like grasping promontories toward
the</p>
<p>promised land. It appeared impossible to dislodge Spain from her pre-
eminence in America; by 1580 she had hundreds of colonies there,</p>
<p>England none; and each year immense riches passed from the mines of
Me.xico and Peru to Spain. It seemed manifest destiny that Spain should
rule all the Western Hemisphere, and make both the Americas in her
political and religious image.</p>
<p>Drake was not content with this prospect. For a time the war for the
world was between himself and Spain. In 1585, financed by his friends
and the Queen, he fitted out thirty vessels and sallied forth against
the</p>
<p>Spanish Empire. He entered the Estuary of Vigo in northwest
Spain,</p>
<p>plundered the port of Vigo, disrobed a statue of the Virgin, and
carried away the precious metals and costly vestments of the churches.
He sailed on to the Canary and Cape Verde islands, pillaged the largest
of them, crossed the Atlantic, raided Santo Domingo, took 30,000 as a
douceur not to destroy the Colombian city of Cartagena, plundered and
burned the town of St. Augustine in Florida, and returned to England
(1586) only because yellow fever had killed a third of his crew.</p>
<p>This was war without its name. On February 8, 1587, the English</p>
<p>government put to death the Scottish Queen. Philip informed Sixtus V
that he was now ready to invade England and dethrone Elizabeth. He asked
the Pope to contribute 2,000,000 gold crowns; Si.xtus offered 600,- 000,
to be paid to Spain only if the invasion actually occurred. Philip bade
his best admiral, the Marquis of Santa Cruz, to prepare the largest
armada so far known in history. Ships were gathered or built at Lisbon,
stores were assembled at Cadiz.</p>
<p>Drake urged Elizabeth to give him a fleet to destroy the Armada
before it could take irresistible form. She consented, and on April 2,
1587, with thirty ships, he hurried out from Plymouth before she could
change her mind. She did, but too late to reach him. On April 16 he ran
his fleet into Cadiz harbor, maneuvered out of range of the batteries on
the shore, sank a Spanish man-of-war, raided the transports and
storeships, captured their cargoes, set all enemy vessels on fire, and
departed unharmed. He anchored off Lisbon and challenged Santa Cruz to
come our and fight. The Marquis refused, for his ships were not yet
armed. Drake moved north to La Coruna and seized great stores collected
there; then to the Azores, where he took a Spanish galleon. W’ith it in
tow he retui’ned to England. Even the</p>
<p>Spaniards marveled at his audacity and seamanship, and said that
“were it not that he was a Lutheran, there was not the like man in the
world.”’®^</p>
<p>Philip patiently rebuilt his fleet. The Marquis of Santa Cruz died
(Janu- ary 1588); Philip replaced him with the Duke of Medina-Sidonia,
a</p>

<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>grandee with more pedigree than competence. When finally the Armada
was complete, it numbered 130 vessels, averaging 445 tons; half the
ships were cargo carriers, half were men-of-war; 8,050 sailors manned
them, 19,000 soldiers sailed. Philip and his admirals thought of naval
warfare in ancient terms — to grapple and board the enemy and fight man
to</p>
<p>man; the English plan was to sink the enemy ’s ships, with their
crowded crews, by broadside fire. Philip instructed his fleet not to
seek out and attack the English squadrons, but to seize some English
beachhead, cross to Flanders, and take on board the 30,000 troops that
the Duke of Parma had ready there; so reinforced, the Spanish were to
march on London. Meanwhile a letter composed by Cardinal Allen (April
1588) was smug- gled into England, bidding the Catholics join the
Spanish in deposing their “usurping, heretic, prostitute” Queen.^®® T o
help restore Catholicism in England, hundreds of monks accompanied the
Armada, under the vicar general of the Inquisition.<sup>®</sup> A devout
religious spirit moved the Spanish sailors and their masters; they
sincerely believed they were on a sacred mission; prostitutes were sent
away, profanity subsided, gambling ceased. On the morning when the fleet
sailed from Lisbon (May 29, 1588),</p>
<p>every man on board received the Eucharist, and all Spain prayed.</p>
<p>The winds favored Elizabeth; the Armada ran into a damaging storm; it
took refuge in the harbor of La Coruna, healed its wounds, and set forth
again (July 12). England awaited it in a feverish mixture of divided
coun- sels, hurried preparations, and desperate resolve. Now the time
had come for Elizabeth to spend the sums that she had saved through
thirty years of skimping and deviltry. Her people. Catholic as well as
Protestant,</p>
<p>came manfully to her rescue; volunteer militia trained in the towns;
Lon- don merchants financed regiments and, asked to fit out fifteen
ships, provided thirty. For ten years now Hawkins had been building
men-of-war for the Queen’s navy; Drake was now a vice -admiral.
Privateers brought their own vessels to the fateful rendezvous. Early in
July 1588 the full complement of eighty-two ships, under command of
Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, as Lord High Admiral of England,
gathered at Plymouth to greet the advancing foe.</p>
<p>On July 19* the vanguard of the Armada was sighted in the mouth of
the Channel. The defending fleet sailed out of Plymouth, and on the
twenty-first the action began. The Spaniards waited for the English to
come close enough for grappling; instead, the light English vessels —
built to low lines and narrow beam — scurried around the heavy Spanish
galleons, firing broadsides as they went. The Spanish decks were too
high; their guns fired too far above the English vessels, doing only
minor</p>

was adopted by Spain in 1582, but not by England till 1751.</li>

<p>damage; the English boats ran beneath the fire, and their
maneuverability and speed left the Spaniards helpless and confused. As
night fell they fled before the wind, leaving one of their ships to be
taken by Drake. Another was blown up, reportedly by a mutinous German
gunner, and the wreck fell into English hands. Luckily, both ships
contained ammuni- tion, which was soon transferred to the Queen’s fleet.
On the twenty - fourth more ammunition came, but still the English had
only enough for a day’s fighting. On the twenty -fifth, near the Isle of
Wight, Howard led an attack; his flagship sailed into the center of the
Armada, exchanging broadsides with every galleon that it passed; and
tlie superior accuracy of the English fire broke the Spanish morale.
“The enemy pursue me,” wrote Medina- Sidonia that night to the Duke of
Parma; “they fire on me from morn till dark, but they will not grapple .
. . There is no remedy, for they are swift and we are slow.”^®® He
begged Parma to send him ammunition and reinforcements, but Parma’s
ports were blockaded by Dutch ships.</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh the Armada anchored in Calais roads. On the
twenty-eighth Drake set fire to eight small and dispensable vessels and
placed them in the wind to sail amid the Spanish fleet. Fearing them,
Medina-Sidonia ordered his ships to put out to sea. On the twenty-ninth
Drake attacked them off the French coast at Gravelines, in the main
action of the war. The Spaniards fought bravely, but with poor
seamanship and gunnery. At noon Howard’s squadron came up, and the full
English fleet poured such fire into the Armada that many of its ships
were disabled and some were sunk; their wooden hulls, though three feet
thick, were penetrated by the English shot; thousands of Spaniards were
killed; blood could be seen flowing from the decks into the sea. At the
close of that day the Armada had lost four thousand men; four thousand
more were</p>
<p>wounded, and the surviving vessels were with difficulty kept afloat.
Seeing that his crews could bear no more, Medina-Sidonia gave orders to
with- draw. On the thirtieth the wind carried the broken fleet into the
North Sea. The English followed them as far north as the Firth of Forth;
then, lacking food and ammunition, they returned to port. They had lost
sixty men and not one ship.</p>
<p>For the remnants of the Armada there was no haven nearer than Spain
itself. Scotland was hostile, and Irish ports were held by English
troops. Desperately the injured ships and starving men made their way
around the British Isles. The water was rough and the wind was wild;
masts were shattered and sails were torn; day after day some vessel sank
or was abandoned, dead men were dropped into the sea. Seventeen ships
were wrecked on the rugged Irish shores; at Sligo alone 1,100
drowned</p>
<p>Spaniards were washed up on the beach. Some of the crews made
landings</p>
<p>CHAP, i;</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>in Ireland and begged for food and drink; they were refused, and
hundreds, too weak to fight, were massacred by the half-savage denizens
of the coasts. Of the 130 vessels that had left Spain, 54 returned; of
27,000 men, 10,000, most of them wounded or sick. Philip, learning of
the prolonged disaster day by day, shut himself up in his Escorial cell,
and none dared speak to him. Sixtus V, pleading that no invasion of
England had occurred, sent not one ducat to bankrupt Sjiain.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was as careful with ducats as the Pope. Wary of peculation
in the navy, she demanded account of every shilling spent by navy and
army before, during, and after the battle; Howard and Hawkins made up
out of their own pockets whatever discrepancies they could not
explain.^®® Elizabeth, expecting a long war, had kept the crews and
troops on short rations and low pay. Now a violent disease, akin to
typhus, ran through the returning men; on some vessels half the crew
died or were disabled; and Hawkins wondered what England’s fate would
have been had the epidemic preceded the enemy.</p>
<p>The naval war continued till Philip’s death (1598). Drake took a
fleet and fifteen thousand men to help the Portuguese in their revolt
against Spain (1589); but the Portuguese hated Protestants more than
Spaniards, the English drank themselves drunk on captured wine, and the
expedition ended in failure and disgrace. Lord Thomas Howard led a fleet
to the Azores to intercept the Spanish flota bringing silver and gold to
Spain; but Philip’s new Armada put Howard’s ships to flight — except the
Revenge, which, caught lagging behind the rest, fought fifteen Spanish
ships hero- ically until overcome (1591). Drake and Hawkins made another
sally to the West Indies (1595), but they quarreled and died on the way.
In 1596 Elizabeth sent still another fleet to destroy ships in Spanish
ports; at Cadiz it found nineteen men-of-war and thirty-six merchantmen;
but these escaped to the open sea while Essex plundered the town. This
expedition too was a failure, but it demonstrated again the English
mastery of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The defeat of the Armada affected almost everything in modern Eu-
ropean civilization. It marked a decisive change in naval tactics;
grappling and boarding gave way to cannonading from shipside and deck.
The weakening of Spain helped the Dutch to win their independence,
advanced Henry IV to the throne of France, and opened North America
to</p>
<p>English colonies. Protestantism was preserved and strengthened,
Cathol- icism waned in England, and James VI of Scotland ceased to flirt
with the popes. Had the Armada been more wisely built and led,
Catholicism might have recovered England, the Guises might have
prevailed in France, Holland might have succumbed; the great burst of
pride and energy that raised up Shakespeare and Bacon as the symbols and
fruit of a triumphant</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>England might never have been; and the Elizabethan ecstasy would have
had to meet the Spanish Inquisition. So wars determine theology and
philosophy, and the ability to kill and destroy is a prerequisite for
permis- sion to live and build.</p>
<p>X. RALEIGH and ESSEX: I588-160I</p>
<p>Though Cecil and Walsingham, Drake and Hawkins had been the</p>
<p>immediate instruments of glory and victory, Elizabeth personified
trium- phant England, and at sixty she was at the top of her fame and
power. Her face was a bit wrinkled, her hair was detachable, some teeth
were missing and some were black, but in her awesome finery of lacy
headdress, flying ruff, padded sleeves, and hoopskirt, all asparkle with
encrusted gems, she stood proud and straight and undeniably a queen.
Parliament grumbled at her royal ways, but submitted; old councilors
offered advice with the timidity of young suitors; and young suitors
fluent with adoration sur- rounded the throne. Leicester and Walsingham
paid their debt to nature, Drake and Hawkins would soon be swallowed by
the sea they had thought to rule. Cecil — the “Atlas of this
commonwealth,” Bacon called him^®’ — was now old, and he creaked with
gout; presently Elizabeth would nurse him in his final illness and feed
him his last food with her own hand.^°® She grew sad with these
amputations, but she did not let them darken the splendor of her
progresses or the vivacity of her court.</p>
<p>New faces shone about her, bringing her some vicarious youth.
Christo- pher Hatton was so handsome that she made him Chancellor
(1587). She waited nine years before accepting Burghley’s advice to make
his sagacious hunchbacked son, Robert Cecil, her Secretary of State. She
relished more the fine features and rattling sword of Walter Raleigh,
and did not mind his private theological doubts; she had some of her
own.</p>
<p>Raleigh was almost the complete Elizabethan man: gentleman, soldier,
mariner, adventurer, poet, philosopher, orator, historian, martyr; here
was the uomo universale of Renaissance dreams, who touched genius at
every point, but never let the part become the whole. Born in Devonshire
in 1552, entered at Oxford in 1568, he fled from books into life and
joined a gallant group of pedigreed volunteers who crossed to France to
fight for the Huguenots. Six years in those wars may have taught him
some of the unscrupulous violence of action and reckless audacity of
speech that molded his later fate. Back in England (1575), he forced
himself to study law, but in 1578 he went off again as a volunteer to
help the Dutch against Spain. Two years later he was in Ireland as a
captain in the army that put down Desmond’s rebellion, and he played no
hesitant part in the Smer -</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>wick massacre. Elizabeth rewarded him with twelve thousand acres in
Ireland and favor at her court. Pleased with his figure, his
compliments,* and his wit, she listened with less than her customary
skepticism to his proposal for English colonies in America; she gave him
a charter, and in 1584 he sent out, but did not accompany, the first of
several expeditions that tried — and failed — to establish a settlement
in Virginia; only the name survived, as a lasting memorial to the
Queen’s inaccessibility. Elizabeth Throckmorton, a maid of honor, proved
more approachable; she accepted Raleigh as her lover, and secretly
married him (1593). As no member of the court might marry without the
Quee n’s consent, the ardent couple received an unexpected honeymoon in
the Tower. Raleigh earned release — with banishment from the court — by
writing to Burghley a letter describing the Queen as an amalgam of all
the perfections in history.</p>
<p>He retired to his Sherborne estate, planned voyages and discoveries,
played with atheism, and wrote poetry whose every line had a character-
istic tang and sting. But two years of quiet exhausted his stability.
With the help of Lord Admiral Howard and Robert Cecil, he fitted out
five vessels and headed for South America, seeking El Dorado — a fabled
land of golden palaces, rivers running gold, and Amazons with
undiminished charms. He sailed a hundred miles up the Orinoco, but found
no female warriors and no gold. Baffled by rapids and falls, he returned
to England empty-handed; but he told how the American natives had
marveled at the beauty of the Queen when he showed them her portrait;
and soon he was readmitted to the court. His eloquent account The
Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiftd Empire of Guiana reafiirmed
his faith that “the sun covereth not sq much riches in any part of the
world’’ as the region of the Orinoco. Tirelessly he preached the
desirability of getting America’s wealth out of Spani sh into English
hands; and he phrased the doctrine of sea power perfectly: “Whoever
commands the sea commands the trade; w’hoever commands the trade of the
world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world
itself.”^®*</p>
<p>In 1596 he joined the expedition to Cadiz, fought as vigorously as he
wrote, and received a wound in the leg. The Queen now “used him gra -
ciously” and made him captain of the guard. In 1 597 he commanded part
of the fleet that Essex led to the Azores. Separated from the rest by a
storm, Raleigh’s squadron encountered and defeated the enemy. Essex
never forgave him for pre-empting victory.</p>
<p>Robert Devereux, second Earl of Essex, surpassed even Raleigh in
fasci- nation. He had Walter’s ambition and verve and pride, a little
more of his</p>
<ul>
<li>The tale of his coat in the mnd beneath her feet is a legend.</li>
</ul>
<p>40</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>hot temper, a little less of his wit, much more of generosity and
noblesse oblige. He was a man of action enamored of intellect — victor
in jousts and on the athletic field, distinguished for bravery and
audacity in war, yet also the helpful and appreciative friend of poets
and philosophers. When his mother bec ame Leicester’s second wife,
Leicester advanced him at court to offset Raleigh’s ingratiating charm.
The Queen, fifty -three, fell maternally in love with the high-strung,
handsome lad of twenty (1587); here was a son to console her
childlessness. They talked, rode, heard music, played cards together,
and “my Lord,” said a gossip, “cometh not to his own lodging till birds
sing in the morning.”^^® Her aging heart suf - fered when he secretly
married Phil ip Sidney’s widow; but she soon for - gave him, and by 1593
he was a member of the Privy Council. However, he was poorly fitted for
court life or statesmanship; “he carried his love and hate always on his
face,” said his servant Cuffe, “and knew not how to hide them.”^^^ He
made enemies of Raleigh, William Cecil, Robert Cecil, finally of the
ungrateful Bacon and the reluctant Queen.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon, who was destined to have more influence on European
thought than any other Elizabethan, had been born (1561) in the very
aura of the court, at York House, official residence of the Lord Keeper
of the Great Seal, who was his father. Sir Nicholas; Elizabeth called
the boy “the young Lord Keeper.” His frail constitution drove him
from</p>
<p>sports to studies; his agile intellect grasped knowledge hungrily;
soon his erudition was among the wonders of those “spacious times.”
After three years at Cambridge he was sent to France with the English
ambassador to let him learn the ways of state. While he was there his
father unexpectedly died (1579) before buying an estate that he had
intended for Francis, who was a younger son; and the youth, suddenly
reduced to meager means, returned to London to study law at Gray’s Inn.
Being a nephew of William Cecil, he appealed to him for some political
place; after four years of waiting, he sent him a whimsical reminder
that “the objection of my years will wear away with the length of my
suit.”^^® Somehow, in that year 1 584, he was elected to Parliament,
though still but twenty-three. He dis-</p>
<p>tinguished himself by favoring more toleration of the Puritans (his
mother was one). The Queen ignored his arguments, but he restated them
bravely in a privately circulated Advertisement Touching the
Controversies of the Church of England (1589). He proposed that no man
should be</p>
<p>molested for his religious faith who promised to defend England
against any foreign power — including the papacy — that threatened
England’s full sovereignty and freedom. Elizabeth and Cecil thought the
young philos- opher a bit forward; and in truth he was ahead of his
times.</p>
<p>Essex relished the keenness of Bacon’s mind and invited his
advice.</p>
<p>The young sage counseled the young noble to seem, if he could not
be,</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>modest; to moderate his expenditures; to seek civil rather than
military office, since setbacks in politics could be sooner redeemed
than defeats in war; and to regard his popularity with the populace as a
danger with the Queen.* Bacon hoped that Essex would mature into a
statesman and give his mentor some opportunity to rise. In 1592 he
appealed again to Cecil in famous lines:</p>
<p>I wax now somewhat ancient; one-and-thirty years is a great deal of
sand in the hourglass . . . The meanness of my estate doth somewhat move
me … I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have moderate
civil ends: for I have taken all knowledge to be my prov-</p>
<p>ince . . . This, whether it be curiosity, or vainglory, or nature . .
.</p>
<p>is so fixed in my mind as it cannot be removed.***</p>
<p>When Essex importuned the Cecils and Elizabeth to give Bacon the</p>
<p>vacant office of attorney general, his appeals were in vain; Edward
Coke, older and technically more fit, was chosen instead. Essex took the
blame handsomely, and gave Bacon an estate at Twickenham with £ i
,800.<strong>® Before Bacon could use this he suffered a brief and
genteel imprisonment for debt.</strong>® In 1 597 he was appointed to
the “Learned Council” of lawyers who advised the Privy Council.***</p>
<p>Despite Bacon’s advice, Essex joined the war party, and planned to
make himself head of the army. His dashing bravery at Cadiz made him too
popular for the Council’s taste; failure at the Azores and his
undiminished pride, extravagance, and sharp tongue alienated the court
and irritated the Queen. When she flatly rejected his recommendation of
Sir George Carew for office in Ireland, he turned his back on her with a
gesture of contempt. Furious, she boxed his ears and cried, “Go to the
Devil!” He grasped his sword and shouted at her, “This is an outrage
that I will not put up with. I would not have borne it from your
father’s hands.” He rushed in anger from the room, and all the court
expected him to be clapped into the Tower (1598).**® Elizabeth did
nothing. On the con- trary — or was it to get rid of him? — a few months
later she appointed him Lord Deputy for Ireland.</p>
<p>Bacon had cautioned him not to seek that ungrateful task of
countering a faith by force; but Essex wanted an army. On March 27,
1599, he left for Dublin amid the acclamations of the populace, the
misgivings of his friends, and the satisfaction of his enemies. Six
months later, having failed in his mission, he hurried back to England
without permission of the Queen, rushed unannounced into her dressing
room, and tried to explain his actions in Ireland. She listened to him
with patient wrath, and had him committed to the custody of the Lord
Keeper at York House until the charges against him could be heard.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>The people of London murmured, for they were ignorant of his failure
and remembered his victories. The Privy Council ordered a semipublic
trial, and commissioned Bacon — as a member of the Learned Council and
as a lawyer pledged to defend the Queen — to draw up a statement of the
charges. He asked to be excused; they insisted; he consented. The
indict- ment he formulated was moderate; Essex acknowledged its truth
and offered humble submission. He was suspended from his offices and was
told to remain in his own home till the Queen should be pleased to free
him (June 5, 1600). Bacon pleaded for him, and on August 26 Essex was
restored to liberty.</p>
<p>Now in his own Essex House, he continued his search for power. One of
his intimates was Shakespeare’s patron, Henry Wriothesley, Earl of
Southampton; him Essex sent to Ireland to propose that Mount) oy, now
Lord Deputy there, should return to England with the English army and
help Fiisex take control of the government. Mount) oy refused. Early in
1601 Essex wrote to James VI of Scotland, asking his aid and promising
to support him as successor to Elizabeth; James sent him a letter of
encour- agement. Wild rumors spread through the excited capital: that
Robert Cecil was planning to make the Spanish Infanta queen of England;
that Essex was to be immured in the Tower; that Raleigh had vowed to
kill him. Perhaps to force Essex to show his hand, the younger Cecil
induced the Queen to send Essex a message requiring him to attend the
Council. His friends warned him that this was a ruse to seize him. One
friend. Sir Gilly Merrick, paid the Chamberlain’s company to stage, that
evening in Southwark, Shakespeare’s Richard I I, showing a sovereign
justly de- posed.^^®</p>
<p>The next morning (February 7, 1601) some three hundred supporters of
Essex, fervent and armed, gathered in the courtyard of his home. When
the Lord Keeper and three other dignitaries came to ask the cause of
this illegal assembly, the crowd locked them up and swept the hesitant
Earl on with them to London and revolution. He had hoped that the people
would rise to his cause, but the preachers bade them stay indoors, and
they obeyed. The forces of the government were on guard and routed the
rebels. Essex was captured and lodged in the Tower.</p>
<p>He was quickly brought to trial on a charge of treason. The
Council</p>
<p>bade Bacon help Coke in preparing the government’s case. His refusal
would have ruined his political career; his consent ruined his
posthumous reputation. When Coke faltered in presenting the indictment.
Bacon rose and stated the matter with convincing, convicting clarity.
Essex confessed his guilt and named his accomplices.^®“ Five of these
were arrested and beheaded. Southampton was sentenced to life
imprisonment; James 1 later released him. Legend told how Essex sent the
Queen a ring once given him by her with a promise to come to his aid if
he should ever return it</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>in his hour of need. If sent, it did not reach her.^^^ On February
25, 1601, aged thirty-five, Essex went gallantly to the fate that was
the seal of his character. Raleigh, his enemy, wept when the blow fell.
For a year the Tower displayed the severed and decaying head.</p>

<li>THE MAGIC fades: 160I-3</li>
</ol>
<p>The sight of that head, or the knowledge that it was staring down
upon her night and day, must have sha red in the somber mood of
Elizabeth’s final years. She sat alone for hours in silent, pensive
melancholy. She maintained the amusements of her court and made at times
a brave pre- tense of gaiety, but her health was gone and her heart was
dead. England had ceased to love her; it felt that she had outlived
herself and should make room for younger royalty. The last of her
Parliaments rebelled more vigorously than any before against her
infringement of parliamentary freedom, her persecution of Puritans, her
rising demands for funds, her gifts of trade monopolies to her
favorites. To everyone’s surprise, the Queen yielded on the last point
and promised to end the abuse. All the members of the Commons went to
thank her, and they knelt as she gave what proved to be her last address
to them, her wistful “Golden Speech” (November 20, 1601):</p>
<p>There is no jewel, be it of never so rich a price, which I prefer</p>
<p>before . . . your love. For I do esteem it more than any treasure . .
.</p>
<p>And though God has raised us high, yet this I count the glory of
my</p>
<p>crown, that I have reigned with your loves . .</p>
<p>She bade them rise and then continued:</p>
<p>To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them</p>
<p>that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it . . . For my own
part, were it not for conscience’ sake to discharge the duty that God
hath</p>
<p>laid upon me, and to maintain His glory, and keep you in safety,
in</p>
<p>mine own disposition I should be willing to resign the place I hold
to any other, and glad to be freed of the glory with the labors; for it
is</p>
<p>not my desire to live or to reign longer than my life and reign shall
be for your good. And though you have had and may have many mightier and
wiser princes sitting in this seat, yet you never had, nor shall have,
any love you better.^-*^</p>
<p>She had postponed as long as she could the question of a successor,
for while the Queen of Scots lived, as legal heir to her throne,
Elizabeth could not reconcile herself to letting Mary undo the
Protestant settlement. Now</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>rhat Mary was dead, and Mary’s son, James VI of Scotland, was heir
apparent, it was some comfort to know that, however vacillating and de-
vious, he was Protestant. She knew that Robert Cecil and others of her
court were secretly negotiating with James to ease his accession and
feather their nests, and were counting the days when she should die.</p>
<p>Rumors moved across Europe that she was dying of cancer. But she was
dying of too much life. Her frame could not bear any more the joys and
sorrows, the burdens and blows of the relentless years. When her god-
son, Sir John Harington, tried to amuse her with witty verses, she sent
him off, sayi ng, “When thou dost feel creeping time at thy gate,
these</p>
<p>fooleries will please thee less.”^^^ In March 1603, having exposed
herself too boldly to the winter cold, she caught a fever. Through three
weeks it consumed her. She spent them mostly in a chair or reclining on
cushions. She would have no doctors, but she asked for music, and some
players came. Finally she was persuaded to take to her bed. Archbishop
Whitgift expressed a hope for her longer life; she rebuked him. He knelt
beside the bed and prayed; when he thought it was enough, he tried to
rise, but she bade him continue; and again, when “the old man’s knees
were weary,”</p>
<p>England, which had long awaited her passing, felt the blow neverthe-
less. Many men realized that a great age had ended, a powerful hand had
fallen from the helm, and some, like Shakespeare, feared a chaotic
inter- lude.^^® Bacon thought her such a great queen that</p>
<p>if Plutarch were now alive to write lives by parallels, it would</p>
<p>trouble him … to find for her a parallel among women. This lady was
endued with learning in her sex singular, and rare even among mascu-
line princes … As for her government . . . this part of the island</p>
<p>never had forty-five years of better times; and yet not through
the</p>
<p>calmness of the season, but through the wisdom of her regiment. For
if there be considered, of the one side, the truth of religion
established, the constant peace and security; the good administration of
justice; the temperate use of the prerogative . . . the flourishing
state of learning . . . and if there be considered, on the other side,
the differences of</p>
<p>religion, the troubles of neighbor countries, the ambition of Spain,
and opposition of Rome; and then that she was solitary and of
herself:</p>
<p>these things I say considered, as I could not have chosen an
〔other〕</p>
<p>instance so recent and so proper, so I suppose I could not have
chosen one more remarkable or eminent . . . concerning the conjunction
of learning in the prince with felicity in the people.^<sup>’</sup></p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>THE GREAT QUEEN</p>
<p>Looking back now in the hindsight of time, we should shade the por-
trait a little, noting and forgiving the faults of the incomparable
Queen. She was no saint or sage, but a woman of temper and passion,
lustily in love with life. The “truth of religion” was not quite
established, and not all her subjects could, as Shak espeare may have
thought, “eat in safety, under their own vines, what they planted, and
sing the merry songs of peace.”^^^ The wisdom of her rule was partly
that of her aides. The</p>
<p>vacillations of her mind proved often fortunate, perhaps by the
chance of change; sometimes they brought such weakness of policy that
the in- ternal troubles of her enemies had to help her to survive. But
survive she did, and she prospered, by fair means or devious. She freed
Scotland from the French and bound it with England; she enabled Henry of
Navarre to balance his Mass in Paris with the Edict of Nantes; she found
England bankrupt and despised, and left it rich and powerful; and the
sinews of learning and literature grew strong in the wealth of her
people. She con- tinued the despotism of her father, but moderated it
with humanity and charm. Denied husband and child, she mothered England,
loved it de- votedly, and used herself up in serving it. She was the
greatest ruler that England has ever known.</p>
