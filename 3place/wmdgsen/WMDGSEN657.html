<h4 id="chapter-xvii">CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<p>From Superstition to Scholarship</p>
<p>1648-1715</p>
<p>I. IMPEDIMENTS</p>
<p>N ATURE, as conceived by all but a small minority of Europeans in</p>
<p>the seventeenth century, was the product or battleground of super-
natural beings benevolent or malevolent, inhabiting human bodies as
souls, or dwelling in trees, woods, rivers, and winds as animating
spirits, or enter- ing organisms as angels or demons, or roaming the air
as michievous elves. None of these spirits was subject to inviolable or
calculable law; any of them could intervene miraculously in the
operations of stones or stars, ani- mals or men; and events not visibly
due to the natural or regular behavior of bodies or minds were
attributed to such supernatural powers taking a mysterious part,
portentous or prophetic, in the affairs of the world. All natural
objects, all planets and their denizens, all constellations and
galaxies, were helpless islands in a supernatural sea.</p>
<p>We have seen some forms of superstition in earlier ages. Most of them
survived the coming of modem science in Copernicus, Vesalius, and Gali-
leo; some flourished in Newton himself. Astrology and alchemy continued
their decline, but astrologers were numerous at the court of Louis XIV;
1 and at Vienna, reported Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in 1717, “there was
a prodigious number of alchemists.” 2 Stur dy Britons still believed in
ghosts, watched for omens, paid for horoscopes, took their dreams as
prophecies, calculated lucky and unlucky days; and less sturdy Britons
begged their king to cure their scrofula with his touch. The seventh
number of The Spectator described the upheaval caused in a British
family by the spilling of a little salt, or by laying a knife and a fork
across each other on a plate, or by allowing thirteen persons in a room
or company. (Note the absence of a thirteenth floor in some
twentieth-century hotels.) In France Jacques Aymer was the hero of his
time (1692) because by the twitching of a hazel twig held in his hand he
could (many believed) detect the nearness of a criminal. 3 In Germany a
magic wand was used to end hemorrhages, heal wounds, and reset bones. 4
In Sweden Stiemhielm was accused of witch- craft when he burned a
peasant’s beard with a magnifying glass; the experi - menter was saved
from death only by the interposition of Queen Christina.® Skeptics of
witchcraft were multiplying, but were probably far out-</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>numbered by believers. The courtiers of Charles II took little stock
in any goblins that might spoil their sport, but the “immense majority,”
and the most prominent authors among the English clergy, still held that
human beings might league themselves with the Devil and thereby acquire
super- natural powers. 6 Joseph Glanvill, an Anglican clergyman of
brilliant mind and forceful style, in Philosophical Considerations
touching Witches and Witchcraft (1666), counted it a shocking wonder
that “men otherwise witty 〔intelligent〕 and ingenious are fallen into
the conceit that there is no such thing as a witch or appariti on”;
doubts of this kind, he warned, would lead to atheism. Another famous
divine, Ralph Cudworth, in his True Intellectual System of the Universe
(1678), denounced as atheists all who denied the reality of witches. 7
The Cambridge Platonist Henry More, in his Antidote to Atheism (1668?),
warmly defended the story of a</p>
<p>“witch” who had been married to Satan for thirty years; and he
thought it sheer blasphemy to question the ability of witches to raise
storms by in- cantation, or ride the air on a broom. 8</p>
<p>The persecution of witches tapered off. The Scottish clergy, however,
distinguished themselves by their burning zeal. At Leith, in 1652, a
variety of tortures induced six women to confess witchcraft; they were
hung up by the thumbs and were flogged; lighted candles were placed
under their feet and in their forcibly opened mouths; four of the six
died of their tor- ments. 9 In 1661 there were fourteen courts trying
witches in Scotland; in 1664 nine women were burned together in Leith.
Such executions con- tinued sporadically in Scotland till 1722. In
England two witches were hanged at Bury St. Edmunds in 1664; three were
put to death in 1682, and an uncertain number in 1712. The arguments of
Weir and Spee, of Hobbes and Spinoza and others, gradually undermined
the witchcraft delusion in the educated laity. Lawyers and magistrates
increasingly withstood the theologians, and refused to prosecute or
convict. In 1712 a jury of simple Englishmen adjudged Jane Wenham guilty
of witchcraft; the judge re- fused to sentence her; the local clergy
denounced him; 10 but there were no executions for witchcraft in England
after that year. In France Colbert secured from Louis XIV an edict
(1672) forbidding condemnations for witchcraft. 11 The Parlement of
Rouen protested that this prohibition vio- lated the Biblical injunction
“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live” (Exodus xxn, 18), and some local
authorities managed to burn seven “sorcerers” in France between 1680 and
1700; but we hear of no executions after 1718. The belief in witchcraft
continued until the temporary triumph of ration- alism in the
eighteenth-century Enlightenment: here and there it still exists.</p>
<p>Censorship and intolerance co-operated with superstition to check the
growth and spread of knowledge. In France the conflicts between kings
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) FROM SUPERSTITION TO SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>popes, between the Gallican Church and the papacy, between Jansenists
and Jesuits, between Catholics and Huguenots, prevented that unity, con-
sistency, and thoroughness of censorship which in this age isolated
Spain from the movements of the European mind. Heretical authors found
ways of evading the censors, and perhaps French wit was stimulated by
the nec- essity of expressing ideas too subtly for officials to
comprehend. In Cath- olic Cologne the Archbishop Elector censored all
speech or publications on religion. In Protestant Brandenburg the Great
Elector, to quiet religious strife, ordered a thorough censorship. In
England, despite the Act of Tol- eration (1689), the government
continued to imprison obnoxious authors and burn heretical books. 12
Nevertheless, the diversity of sects in Protestant lands made censorship
less effective there than in Catholic countries; partly for this reason
England and Holland, in the seventeenth century, excelled in science and
philosophy.</p>
<p>The competing faiths agreed on intolerance. The Catholic Church
argued quite cogently that since nearly all Christians accepted the
Bible as the word of God, and as, according to the Bible, the Son of God
had founded the Church, it was clearly her right and duty to suppress
heresy. Protestant denominations came to a similar but less sanguinary
conclusion: since the Bible was God’s word, anyone deviating from its
teachings (as officially interpreted) should at least be suppressed, and
be thankful that he was not killed. The Treaty of Westphalia (1648)
recognized three religions as legal in Germany: Catholicism,
Lutheranism, and Calvinism; each ruler was left free to choose any one
of these, and to enforce it upon his subjects. The Scandinavian
countries allowed no religious faith but the Lutheran. Switz- erland
permitted each canton to determine its own creed. France led the way to
toleration by the Edict of Nantes (1598), and led the way back by the
Revocation (1685). England, after 1689, eased the disabilities of Dis-
senters, continued diose of Catholics, and exterminated a third of all
Cath- olics in Ireland. The rationalist Hobbes agreed with the popes on
the necessity of intolerance.</p>
<p>However, toleration grew. The critical study of the Bible began in
this age to free men to admire it as literature while suspecting it as
science, and the multiplication of sects made social order increasingly
difficult without mutual toleration. In New England Roger Williams
announced (1644) that it was “the will and command of God” that
“permission of the most paganish, Jewish, Turkish, or Antichristian
consciences and worships be granted to all men in all nations.” 13 John
Milton pleaded for “unlicensed printing” (1644), and Jeremy Taylor
defended “liberty of prophesying” (1646). James Harrington (1656)
allowed no limits to religious freedom: “Where civil liberty is entire,
it includes liberty of conscience; where lib - erty of conscience is
entire . . . , a man, according to the dictates of his own</p>
<p>484</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>conscience, may have the full exercise of his religion, without
impediment to his preferment or employment in the state.” 14 In
commercial countries like Holland, and even in Catholic Venice, the
necessities of trade com- pelled tolerance of the diverse religions of
merchants from alien lands. It was in liberal Holland that Spinoza
published in his Tractatus theologico- politicus (1670) a plea for the
full toleration of heretical ideas; in Holland Bayle defended toleration
in his Philosophical Commentary on the Text, Compel them to come in
(1686); and it was after years of residence in Holland that Locke issued
his Letters on Toleration (1689). Decade after decade the demand for
intellectual freedom rose, and by the end of the seventeenth century no
church would have dared to do what had been done to Bruno in 1600, or to
Galileo in 1633. Eppur si muove.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>EDUCATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowledge was slowly spreading, through newspapers, journals, pam-
phlets, books, libraries, schools, academies, universities. News, in the
seventeenth century, became a commodity bought and sold, first to
bankers, then to statesmen, then to anyone. In 17 1 1 the total
circulation of British newspapers, daily or weekly, was 44,ooo. 15</p>
<p>The Journal des savants, founded in 1665, recognized that events in
the world of literature and scholarship could also be news; soon it
established itself as an international medium of scholars, scientists,
and literary men. Within a few years it had competitors: the Giornale
de’ letterati of Rome (1668), the Giornale Veneto of Venice (1671), and
the Acta Eruditorum of Leipzig (1682). Bayle founded a famous review at
Rotterdam in 1684, Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres; and two years
later Jean Le Clerc began the monthly Bibliotheque universelle ; some of
the most important pronouncements of Locke and Leibniz were made in
these periodicals.</p>
<p>The circulation of books was growing rapidly. In 1701 there were 178
master booksellers in Paris, thirty-six of them printers and publishers.
18 Libraries old and new were making their treasures more widely
available. In 1610 Sir Thomas Bodley obtained from the Stationers’
Company a grant whereby the Bodleian Library that he had established at
Oxford (1598) was to receive a copy of every book published in England;
so in 1930 it had 1,250,000 volumes. In 1617 a decree of Louis XIII
ordered that two copies of every new publication in France be deposited
in the Bibliotheque Royale (now Nationale) at Paris. In 1622 this
collection had 6,000 volumes; in 1715, largely through the zeal of
Colbert, 70,000; in 1926, 4,400,000. The Great Elector of Brandenburg
founded a national library at Berlin in 1661. In that year Mazarin
bequeathed his costly library of 40,000 volumes to</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) FROM SUPERSTITION TO SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>Louis XIV and France, and in 1700 the descendants of Sir Robert Bruce
Cotton deeded the Cottonian Library to the British Museum. The first
English library open to the general public was opened by Thomas Tenison
in London in 1695.</p>
<p>Education was laboring to redeem the losses it had sustained from the
Religious Wars in France, the Civil War in England, and the Thi rty
Years’ War in Germany. Not till Lessing (1729-81) did German schools
and</p>
<p>literature regain the stature they had reached with Luther, Ulrich
von Hut- ten, and Melanchthon two centuries before. In the interval a
mediocre Latin remained the esoteric language of the literary few, while
German, so lusty in Luther, became a merely plebeian instrument; and not
a single writer of German rose to international repute during the long
penance for a generation of fratricidal war. The German nobility,
disdaining the Latin pedantry of the universities, sent their sons to
Ritterakademien — knight schools — or engaged private tutors to prepare
pedigreed youth for the tasks and graces of princely courts. At the
other end of the social scale August Francke, the Pietist, organized at
Halle his Stiftungen, charitable institutions ridiculed by cynics as
“ragged schools,” where, through</p>
<p>thirty-two years (1695-1727), he fed, clothed, and taught the
children of the poor. Soon he added a Hauptschule for the secondary
education of his brightest boys, and a hohere Tochterschule for his
brightest girls. All these schools gave half their time to religion.</p>
<p>The secular spirit in Germany found voice in Christian Thomasius. We
shall commemorate him later as a philosopher; here we see him as the
great- est German educator of his time. Driven from his native Leipzig
because of his heresies, he moved to Halle, in the rising state of
Brandenburg-Prussia (1690); his lectures there led to the founding of
the university; he became its most famous professor, and the protagonist
in making it the first “modern” university. He laughed Scholasticism out
of face, replaced Latin with German as the language of instruction,
published a German magazine, introduced science courses into the
curriculum, and fought for the freedom of teachers and students to
think. Frederick the Great called him the father of the Aufklarung , the
German Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Elementary education was made universal and compulsory for both sexes
in the duchy of Wiirttemberg in 1565, in the Dutch Republic in 1618, in
the duchy of Weimar in 1619, in Scotland in 1696, in France in 1698, in
England in 1876. The delay in England was due to the wide extension of
voluntary education through private religious agencies, and to the
feeling in the ruling classes that in the prevailing economic system the
education of the poor was unnecessary and probably undesirable. The
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge beg an in 1699 to establish
“charity</p>
<p>schools” for poor children, chiefly to transmit Christian theology
and dis -</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>cipline; all teachers were to be members of the Church of England,
and required a license from the bishop. Bernard Mandeville, who made a
stir in 1714 with his Fable of the Bees, denounced these schools as a
waste of money; if parents were too poor to pay for the education of
their children, he said, “it is impudence in them to aspire any
further.” 17</p>
<p>In France every parish had to maintain an elementary school. The
teacher was usually a layman, but he was chosen and controlled by the
bishop, and instruction was firmly Catholic. The petites ecoles of
Port-Royal reached only a few selected boys. In 1684 Jean Baptiste de La
Salle founded the Freres des Ecoles Chretiennes, soon to be known as the
Freres Chretiens. La Salle, an ascetic priest, made religion the
pervading essence of the edu- cation which these “Christian Brothers”
offered gratis to the children of the poor. Four hours a day were
devoted to religious exercises; reading, writing, and arithmetic were
added; but the never forgotten aim was to train loyal Catholics, and to
save souls from worldly riot and everlasting hell. Flogging was found
useful for these purposes. Teachers were ex- horted to teach by example
rather than precept. In 1685 the Christian Brothers opened what was
probably the first modern institution for the training of
elementary-school teachers.</p>
<p>Secondary education in France remained in the hands of the Jesuits,
and was still the best in Christendom. Their Collegium Societatis Jesu,
directly behind the Sorbonne, changed its name to Collegium Ludovici
Magni, or College Louis-le-Grand, after the King attended a play
produced there by the pupils in 1674. At the urging of Mme. de Maintenon
Louis XIV in 1686 opened at St.-Cyr (three miles from Versailles) the
first French boarding school for girls. Nunneries provided higher
education for elite paying girls, always with the emphasis on religion.
Catholic and Protestant authorities agreed in the conviction that human
nature was so ill adjusted to civilized restraints that it could be
molded to morality and order only through the fear of God. The attempt
to educate character without the aid of religion is still in the
experimental stage.</p>
<p>Except in the Dutch Republic, universities were now in decline,
purged by victorious sects, disordered by riotous students, and
dominated by bar- ren theological disputes. In France and Germany
university degrees were sold for cash. None of the great philosophers of
the period, and few of the leading scientists, were on university
staffs, and Hobbes, Leibniz, and Bayle all spoke of the professors with
a contempt that made no allowance for public pressures upon public
employees. Some new universities were opened in this period: Duisberg
(1655), Durham (1657), Kiel (1665), Lund (1666), Innsbruck (1673), Halle
(1694), and Breslau (1702). These were mostly small establishments,
seldom having more than twenty pro- fessors or four hundred pupils. In
nearly all of them the curriculum had</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) FROM SUPERSTITION TO SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>stiffened with age, and the requirements of orthodoxy cramped
students and teachers alike. Milton complained that the English
universities took “from young men the use of their reason by certain
charms compounded of metaphysics, miracles, traditions, and absurd
scriptures”; he felt that he had misspent his years at Cambridge trying
to digest “an asinine feast of sour thistles and bramble,” and other
“sophistical trash.” 18 This bondage of tradition continued in Oxford
and Cambridge until the example of the Royal Society, and the
professorate of Newton at Trinity College (1669-1702), stirred Cambridge
to give a daring prominence to science.</p>
<p>Poets, priests, journalists, and philosophers struggled to
reinvigorate edu- cation. We have summarized Milton’s “Letter to
Mr. Hartlib” (1644) on the ideal school; his prescriptions had no
influence upon actual teaching. In France the most attractive
contribution was Fenelon’s little Traite de V education des filles
(1687). Mme. de Beauvilliers had asked him to out- line some principles
to guide the instruction of her daughters. The priest naturally stressed
the religious reinforcement of the moral code, but he deprecated the
austerities and seclusion of conventual schooling; nunneries, he felt,
“provided no preparation for life in the world, i nto which the convent
graduate entered as one emerging into full daylight from a cave.” 19 He
pleaded for gentle methods in teaching; education should suit itself to
the nature, interests, and sensitivity of the child, rather than bend
all pupils to one inflexible rule. Let us teach the way nature teaches —
not by abstrac- tions but by leading children into the middle of things;
let their games and their natural interests be used as means of
instruction. (Here were Rous- seau’s pedagogy, and the “progressive
education” of the twentieth century, expounded by a priest of the
seventeenth.) Fenelon wished girls to read the classics, if possible in
the original languages; they ought to learn some history, and enough law
to govern an estate; but they should not meddle with science — a young
woman should show a certain “modesty about science” (une pudeur sur la
science). The handsome priest was sensitive to feminine charms, and did
not want them clothed in algebra; he would never have understood Voltai
re’s love for that professor of Newtonian mechanics, Mme. du
Chatelet.</p>
<p>Ten years after Fenelon’s Traite, Defoe published his appeal for
the</p>
<p>higher education of women. Except in rich homes, English girls of the
seventeenth century found little opportunity for secondary education.
Like Esther Johnson with Jonathan Swift, they had to rely on tutors, or,
like Evelyn’s favorite daughter, they had to purloin knowledge by
private enterprise. Macaulay judged that “even in the highest ranks the
English women of that generation 〔1685-1715〕 were decidedly worse
educated than they have been at any other time since the Revival of
Learning.” 20 Swift estimated that hardly one gentlewoman in a thousand
was taught</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>to read or spell; 21 but that gloomy Dean throve on exaggerations. In
any case Defoe thought the neglect of feminine education a barbarous
inequity. “I cannot think that God Almighty ever made women so delicate,
so glori - ous creatures, and furnished them with such charms … to be
only stew- ards of our houses, cooks, and slaves.” So he proposed for
girls an academy</p>
<p>By far the best considered and most influential contribution to peda-
gogical theory in this age of Louis XIV was John Locke’s Some Thoughts
concerning Education (169 3), 28 written after the author had served
several years as tutor in the family of the first Earl of Shaftesbury.
Taking cues from Montaigne, the philosopher proposed that the teacher
should first aim at physical health and stamina; a sound body is
prerequisite to a sound mind. So his pupils are to eat a simple diet,
accustom themselves to scanty clothing, hard beds, cold weather, fresh
air, plenty of exercise, regular sleep, no wine or liquor, and “very
little or no physick” (medicine) . Second in time but first in
importance is the formation of character; all education, physical and
mental as well as moral, should be a discipline in virtue. And as the
body is to be trained to health by hardships, so character is to be
molded by inculcating self-denial in all things that run counter to
mature reason. “Children should be used to submit their desires, and go
without their longings, even from their very cradles”; the discipline of
desire is the backbone of character. This discipline is to be made as
pleas- ant as possible, but it is to be insisted upon throughout. Nor
will single good actions suffice; the pupil must be formed by the
repetition of virtuous actions into good habits ; for “habits work more
constantly and with greater</p>

<p>The education of the intellect should be a discipline in methods
of</p>
<p>thought and rigor of reasoning, not a digest of classics or a
bandying of languages. French and Latin should be taught to the children
at an early age, and by conversation rather than by grammar. Greek,
Hebrew, and Arabic should be left to professional scholars. It would be
better to give time to geography, mathematics, astronomy, and anatomy;
later to ethics and law; finally to philosophy. “The business of
education is not to make the young perfect in any one of the sciences,
but so to open and dispose their minds as may best make them capable of
any, when they shall apply themselves to it.” And as virtue is to be
trained by habit, so thought is to</p>
<p>Nothing does this better than mathematics, which therefore, I think,
should be taught to all those who have the time and opportunity, not so
much to make them mathematicians as to make them reasonable creatures. .
. . We are bom to be, if we please, reasonable creatures, but it is use
and exercise that makes us so, and we are indeed so no further than
industry and application has carried us. … I have men-</p>
<p>tioned mathematics as a way to settle in the mind a habit of
reasoning closely and in train . . . ; that, having got the way of
reasoning which that study naturally brings the mind to, they might be
able to transfer it to other parts of knowledge as they shall have
occasion . 24</p>
<p>Locke’s treatise was designed for a “liberal education” — i.e., one
chiefly in arts, literature, and manners; it was intended to produce a
gentleman — i.e ., a man of “gentle” birth, who would never have to work
for a living.* Its curriculum, while admitting some sciences, generally
adhered to the “humanities” — the studies favored by the Renaissance
humanists. It in- cluded also dancing, riding, wrestlin g, fencing, and
even “a manual trade, nay two or three,” but as helps to health and
character, not as means of livelihood. The arts were to be taught as
recreations, not as professions; the young gentleman was not to take
such affairs very seriously; he should enjoy poetry, but not write it
except as a pastime; he should be taught to enjoy music, but not to seek
proficiency on any instrument; this would take too much time, and,
besides, it would put the youth into “such odd company.” So Locke’s
treat ise was both conservative and liberal. In its repudiation of
Scholastic absorption in ancient languages, its lessened stress on
religion and theology, its emphasis on health and character, and its
effort to prepare well-born youth for public life and service, it
pointed to the future, and had immense influence in England and America.
It shared in forming the physical and moral side of education in the
English “public”</p>
<p>• Gentlemen goes back to the Latin gens, a clan or family line of
freemen. A “liberal” education was originally one intended for freemen (
liberi ).</p>

<p>schools. Translated into French (1695), it went through five editions
in fifty years, and gave many suggestions to Rousseau. Locke’s own
pupil, the third Earl of Shaftesbury, whom we shall meet again, did
credit to his teacher’s theories and character.</p>

<li>THE SCHOLARS</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite their apparent preoccupation with dying languages and dead
debates, great scholars continued to mold the future by illuminating the
past; and some found themselves embattled in the struggle of
Christianity against free thought.</p>
<p>Certain minor devotees merit a passing reverence. Charles du Fresne,
Sieur du Cange, astonished his contemporaries — who knew him as a lawyer
in the Paris Parlement — by issuing (1678) a dictionary of late and
medieval Latin in three volumes so meticulous in scholarship that they
are still the authority in their field. Pierre Huet discovered and
edited a major manu- script of Origen, learned Syriac, Arabic, and
chemistry, made eight hun- dred anatomical dissections, wrote poetry and
fiction, and shared with the learned Mme. Dacier in editing for the
instruction of the Dauphin the famous sixty- volume “Delphin” edition of
Latin classics; he was made bishop of Avranches, and, dying, left the
library that is now a treasured part of the Bibliotheque Nationale. The
Jesuit “Bollandists” continued their centipedalian Acta Sanctorum. In
Paris, under the lead of Jean Mabillon, the Benedictine Congregation of
St.-Maur compiled (1668-1702) a twenty- volume history of Benedictine
saints; in the process they shed precious light upon the annals and
literature of medieval France. Mabillon himself gave a new form to Latin
paleography by his De Re diplomatica (1681) — not a manual of diplomacy
but a treatise on the date, character, and au- thenticity of old
charters and manuscripts. Completing one of his fat folios, Mabillon
wrote: “May it please God not to impute it to me as a crime that I have
passed so many years studying the acts of the saints, and yet resemble
them so little.” 25</p>
<p>The giant of classical erudition in this age was Richard Bentley,
stern master of Trinity College, Cambridge, for forty-two years. His
youth was consumed in consuming the Bodleian Library; at twenty-nine he
was al- ready among the most learned pundits of Europe in Greek, Latin,
and Hebrew literature and antiquities. In that year (1691) he published
a hundred-page Epistola ad Millium, a letter to an early John Mill, so
accurate and recondite in its scholarship that it gave him a European
fame. At thirty he was chosen to give the first series of the lectures
for which funds and a name had been provided in the will of the pious
chemist Robert Boyle.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) FROM SUPERSTITION TO SCHOLARSHIP 491</p>
<p>He responded by arguing powerfully that the cosmic order revealed in
Newton’s recent Principia proved the existence of God. This was a
great</p>
<p>The contest arose from the English share in the debate on the
relative merits of ancient versus modern literature. Sir William Temple
opened fire with the essay Of Ancient and Modern Learning (1690),
defending antiquity. Bentley would probably have praised the essay had
it not praised Phalaris as an example of Greek superiority in
literature. Phalaris was a dictator who governed Akragas (Agrigento) in
Greek Sicily in the sixth century before Christ. History or legend
described him as roasting his enemies in the belly of a brazen bull; but
it honored him as a patron of literature, and 148 letters had come down
the centuries allegedly from his pen. Charles Boyle, an undergraduate at
Christ Church College, Oxford, published the letters in 1695. William
Wotton, preparing a second edition (1697) of his Reflections upon
Ancient and Modern Learning , in which he opposed Temple, asked Bentley
to judge the authenticity of the letters. Bentley replied that their
attribution to Phalaris was a mistake, that they were written in the
second century a.d.; incidentally he pointed out some errors in Charles
Boyle’s edition. Boyle and his teachers issued a hot defense</p>
<p>Every living language, like the perspiring bodies of living
creatures,</p>
<p>is in perpetual motion and alteration; some words go off and become
obsolete; others are taken in and by degrees grow into common use; or
the same word is inverted to a new sense and notion, which in tract of
time makes as observable a change in the air and features of a language
as age makes in the lines and mien of a face. All are sensible of this
in their own native tongues, where continual use makes every man a</p>
<p>critic. For what Englishman does not think himself able, from the
very turn and fashion of the style, to distinguish a fresh English

<p>tion from another a hundred years old? Now, there are as real and</p>
<p>sensible differences in the several ages of Greek. . . , but very few
are so versed and practised in that language as ever to arrive at that
sub- tlety of taste. 27</p>
<p>Here was a scholar who could write English as well as read Greek.</p>
<p>In 1699 the unanimous vote of the six bishops appointed by William
III to nominate for the vacancy raised Bentley to the mastership of
Trinity Col- lege, Cambridge. He reformed student discipline, improved
the curricu- lum, and built an “elaboratory” for chemistry and an
observatory for astronomy; but he so alienated the faculty by his pomp
and overbearing ways, and his affection for money, that he was twice
sentenced to removal from his office; he fought back, and kept his post
to the end. Meanwhile he edited a large number of Greek and Latin
classics, encouraged and fi- nanced the second edition of Newton’s
Principia, demolished Anthony Collins in Remarks on a Late Discourse of
Freethinking (1713), and ven- tured rashly from his field by editing
Paradise Lost with pedantic correc- tions of Milton’s grammar and text.
He made an enemy of Alexander Pope by saying of his translation of the
Iliad , “A pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.” “The
portentous cub,” Bentley reported, never forgave him. In The Dunciad
(April, 1742) Pope ridiculed him as</p>
<p>The mighty scholiast, whose unwearied pains</p>
<p>Made Horace dull, and humbled Milton’s strains. 28</p>
<p>In July Bentley died from a complication of Pope and pleurisy. He was
the greatest and most insufferable scholar that England ever produced.
Meanwhile another Englishman, Thomas Stanley, broadened the British mind
with the first English History of Philosophy (1655-62), and sur- prised
his readers by devoting the last of its four volumes to “Chaldaic
〔Arabic〕 Philosophy.” Scholarship was venturing beyond ancient Rome
and Greece to the Near and Middle East, with disturbing results. Edward
Pococke discovered and edited four Syrian versions of the New Testament
Epistles (1630); for him Oxford established its first chair of Arabic,
and his lectures there opened English eyes to Islamic civilization. In
France Barthelemy d’Herbelot’s lifework, an immense Bibliotheque or
ientale (1697) — subtitled Universal Dictionary Containing Generally All
That Concerns a Knowledge of . . . the Orient — was a revelation of
Arabic history and learning, and played a part in that broadening of
intellectual horizons which burst all bonds in the eighteenth-century
Enlightenment. Students wondered at the wealth of Arabic poetry,
historiography, philoso- phy, and science; they noted hbw the Arabs had
preserved Greek science and philosophy while these were being forgotten
in the Dark Ages of</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) FROM SUPERSTITION TO SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>493</p>
<p>Western Europe; they learned that Mohammed was no mere imposter but a
subtle statesman; and they were puzzled to find no more crime, and no
less virtue, in Islam than in Christendom. The relativity of morals and
theology became a dissolving ferment in the Christian mind.</p>
<p>Studies of Oriental — including Egyptian and Chinese — chronology un-
dermined the Jewish calculation that the world had been created in 3761
b.c., and the computation (1650) of James Ussher, Anglican Archbishop of
Armagh in Ireland, that the Creation had occurred “at the beginning of
the night before Monday, the 23rd of October, 4004 b.c .” 29 Spinoza, as
we shall p resently see, was inaugurating (1670) the “higher criticism”
of the Bible — the study of it as a human production rich in grandeur
and nobility, in errors and absurdities.</p>
<p>The most learned Biblical critic of the seventeenth century, in an
at- tempt to answer Spinoza, brought down upon his head the thunder of
Bossuet for finally conceding much of what the philosopher had claimed.
Richard Simon, a blacksmith’s son, had joined the Oratory at Paris, and
had been ordained a priest (1670). In that year he wrote a pamphlet de-
fending the Jews of Metz, who had been accused of murdering a Christian
child. In 1678, after years of research including studies with several
rabbis, he prepared to publish his Histone critique du Vieux Testament.
He pro- posed en passant to refute Spinoza’s arguments against the
divine inspira - tion of the Scriptures. He admitted that the books of
the Old Testament were not entirely the work of the authors to whom they
were ascribed; that Moses could not have written all the Pentateuch
(which described Moses’ death); and that the Biblical books had been
considerably altered</p>
<p>The general of the Oratory sanctioned the publication of Simon’s
book. But while it was in the press some of the proof sheets came under
the eye of the “Great” Arnauld of Port -Royal. He was alarmed. He showed
the sheets to Bossuet, who at once denounced the volume as “a tissue of
im - pieties and a bulwark of free thought,” which would “destroy th e
authority of canonical scripture.” 30 Bossuet appealed to the secular
authorities to</p>
<p>494</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>prevent publication of the book. They confiscated the entire issue of
thir- teen hundred copies, and reduced them to pulp. Simon retired to an
obscure curacy in Normandy, but he found ways of having his manuscript
printed in Rotterdam (1685). Four years later he published his Histoire
critique du Nouveau Testament. He proposed to complete his labors with a
new trans- lation of the Bible; he finished his version of the New
Testament; but Bos- suet, shocked by the freedom with which Simon
handled the sacred text, persuaded the Chancellor to suppress the book
(1703). Simon abandoned his enterprise, burned his papers, and died
(1712).</p>
<p>His work on the Old Testament elicited forty refutations,
indicating</p>
<p>its irrefutability. With Spinoza’s Tractatus theologico -politicus it
remains one of the landmarks in the modem study of the Bible. Leibniz,
reading these early critiques, warned that this line of inquiry, if
continued, would destroy Christianity. 31 It is still too early to say
whether Leibniz was right.</p>
