<h4 id="chapter-xxxvi-to-elba">CHAPTER XXXVI To Elba</h4>
<p>1813-14</p>
<p>I. TO BERLIN</p>
<p>A LL Europe seemed to strain back to its eighteenth-century divisions
as Napoleon rushed over its snows and through its cities to fortify
his</p>
<p>shaken throne; every old boundary became a crack in the baseless
edifice of alien power. The Milanese, mourning sons who had been called
to serve Napoleon in Russia and had never returned, prepared to unseat
the amiable Eugene, absent viceroy of an absent king; the Romans, fond
of the patient Pope who was still languishing in Fontainebleau
captivity, prayed for his return to his Apostolic See; Neapolitan
princes and populace watched for the moment when the ambitious Murat,
slipping on his ego, would fall be- fore a Bourbon anointed and
legitimate. Austria, dismembered by war and humiliated by a harsh peace,
waited anxiously for Metternich to free it, by some diplomatic finesse,
from its forced alliance with its traditional enemy. The confederated
states along the Rhine dreamed of a prosperity that would not have to be
paid for by the surrender of their sons to an alien and uncon- trollable
genius. Prussia, shorn of half its territory and resources by its
ancient enemy now its unwelcome ally, saw its despoiler shattered by a
colossal calamity: here at last was the opportunity long prayed for; now
it remembered Fichte’s call, and heard the exiled Stein’s appeal, to
throw out those French troops that were patrolling them, those French
indemnity- collectors that were bleeding them, and to stand free and
strong as under Frederick, and become a bastion for German liberty.</p>
<p>Behind these kindred rebellions lay the surprising news that Russia
had not only defeated the supposedly invincible Corsican, had not only
expelled the French army from her soil, but was pursuing it over the
frontier into the grand duchy of Warsaw, and was calling upon the
heartland of Europe to join her in a holy war to overthrow the usurper
who had made France the agent of his Continental tyranny.</p>
<p>On December 18, 1812 — the day on which the beaten Napoleon reached
Paris — Alexander left St. Petersburg. On the 23rd he reached Vilna, and
shared with Kutuzov and his army in celebrating victory. That army too
had suffered on the march that escorted and gnawed at the departing
French; a hundred thousand men had died, fifty thousand had been
wounded, fifty thousand had deserted or been lost. 1 Alexander publicly
praised their gen- eral, but privately questio ned his leadership. “All
he did against the enemy,”</p>
<p>712</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>TO ELBA</p>
<p>7*3</p>
<p>he told Sir Robert Wilson (if we may believe Sir Robert), “was what
he could not help doing, being driven to it by the force of
circumstances. He was victorious in spite of himself…. I will not leave
the army anymore, because I do not want to abandon it to the dangers of
such a command.” 2 Nevertheless, he conferred upon the tired warrior the
highest Russian mili- tary decoration — the Grand Cross of the Order of
St. George.</p>
<p>Convinced, by the fulfillment of his predictions, that he was in some
way divinely inspired, and that he might proceed with all the forces of
Provi- dence behind him, Alexander overruled the hesitations of his
general, took on the supreme command of his united armies, and ordered
them to march to the western frontier. Avoiding Kovno, which was
opposite to still hostile Poland, he continued along the Niemen to
Tauroggen, where General Johann Yorck von Wartenburg, commanding a force
of Prussians, allowed the Russians to cross the river into East Prussia
(December 30, 1812). Stein, who had accompanied Alexander from
St. Petersburg, urged him to proceed in the expectation that the people
of Prussia would welcome him. The Czar proclaimed amnesty to all
Prussians who had fought against him, and called upon the King and the
people of Prussia to join him in his crusade. Fred- erick William III,
tom between the French Eagle and the Russian Bear, re- fused to approve
of Yorclc’s action, and withdrew from Berlin to Breslau. Alexander
advanced across East Prussia, and was greeted joyfully by the people
with shouts of “Long live Alexander! Long live the Cossacks!” 3</p>
<p>Approaching the boundary between East Prussia and Poland, the Emperor
sent a message to the Polish leaders, promising amnesty, a constitution,
and a kingdom with the czar of Russia as king. Apparently by a secret
under- standing between Russia and Austria, Prince Karl Philipp von
Schwarzen- berg, commanding Austrian troops in Warsaw, withdrew them to
Galicia. The Polish authorities came out to welcome Alexander, and on
February 7, 1813, he entered the capital unchallenged. The “grand duchy
of Warsaw” came to this early death, and Poland in its entirety became a
dependency of Russia. Prussia had hoped to recover that part of Poland
which she had pos- sessed in 1795; Alexander hastened to assure
Frederick William III that an acceptable equivalent would soon be found
for his lost share. Meanwhile he again urged the King and people of
Prussia to join him against Napoleon. The Prussians had long been
waiting for such a call. They were a proud people, still remembering
Frederick. The spirit of nationalism had been in- tensified by the quick
expansion of France and the successful uprising of Spain. The middle
classes were hot in protest against the Continental Block- ade and the
high taxes levied to pay the French indemnity. The Christians of Prussia
were fond of their churches and jealous of their creeds, but all sects
distrusted Napoleon as a secret atheist, and united in condemning his
treatment of the Pope. The Tugenbund, or Union of Virtue, appealed to
all Germans to come together in defense of their common Vaterland. The
King of Prussia allowed his ministers to rebuild and expand the Prussian
Army on the pretext of defending Prussia against Alexander’s invasion.
The Russians had taken Marienburg in January, on March 1 1 they
marched</p>
<p>714 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>unresisted into Berlin. Forced to a decision, the peace-loving king,
from Breslau, issued “An mein Volk” (To My People), on March 17, a
moving call to rise in arms against Napoleon:</p>
<p>… Brandenburgers, Prussians, Silesians, Pomeranians, Lithuanians! You
know what you have borne for the past seven years; you know the sad fate
that awaits you if we do not bring this war to an honorable end. Think
of the times gone by — of the great Elector, the great Frederick!
Remember the</p>
<p>This is the final, the decisive struggle; upon it depends our
independence, our prosperity, our existence. There are no other
alternatives but an honorable peace or an heroic end….</p>
<p>We may confidently await the outcome. God and our own firm purpose
will bring victory to our cause, and with it an assured and glorious
peace, and the return of happier times.</p>
<p>All classes rose to the King’s call. The clergy— especially the
Protestant- proclaimed a holy war against the infidel. Teachers — Fichte
and Schleier- macher among them — dismissed their students, saying that
the time called not for study but for action. Hegel remained above “the
battle,” but Goethe gave his blessing to a regiment that saluted him in
passing. 4 Poets — Schenken- dorf, Uhland, Ruckert — put into verse the
sentiments of King and people, or put their pens aside for muskets or
swords; and some of them, like Theo- dor Korner, died in action. Ernst
Moritz Arndt, returning from exile in Russia, helped to rouse and form
the German spirit with his song “Was ist das Deutschen Vaterland?” In
that “War of Liberation” a new Germany was bom.</p>
<p>However, no nation, when its existence is at stake, can rely upon
volun- teers. So, on the day of his appeal to his people, Frederick
William III ordered the conscription of all men between seventeen and
forty years of age, and allowed no substitutes. When the spring of 1813
began, Prussia had</p>
<p>60.000 men trained and ready for service. Of the several armies that
had come in from Russia some 50,000 men were fit for action. With
these</p>
<p>110.000 troops 5 Alexander and Frederick William entered upon the
cam- paign that was to decide the fate of Napoleon and the structure of
Europe.</p>
<p>They realized that this would not be enough, and they sought allies
who could contribute men and funds. Austria for the time being chose to
remain faithful to her alliance with France; she feared that she would
be the first to be attacked if she joined the new coalition; and Francis
II remembered that he had a daughter on the French throne. Prince
Bernadotte had promised Alexander 30,000 men, 6 but he had committed
most of them to the conquest of Norway. England, as April ended, pledged
two million pounds sterling to the new campaign. Prussia opened her
ports to British goods, and soon these were coming in good quantity to
storehouses on the Elbe.</p>
<p>Kutuzov died in Silesia on April 28, still advising the Russians to
go home.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>TO ELBA</p>
<p>715</p>
<p>Alexander summoned Barclay de Tolly to succeed Kutuzov in direct com-
mand of the Russian Army, but kept the supreme command himself. Now he
set out to accomplish westward all that Napoleon had hoped to achieve
eastward: to invade the enemy’s country, defeat his armies, capture his
capi - tal, force him to abdicate, and compel him to peace.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>TO PRAGUE</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile Napoleon was fighting for survival in a France no longer
fasci- nated by his victories. Almost every family in the country was
now to yield another son or brother. The middle classes had welcomed
Napoleon as their protector, but now he was more monarchical than the
Bourbons, and he was courting royalists, who were plotting to depose
him. Priests distrusted him; generals were praying for peace. He himself
was weary of war. Heavy in the paunch, plagued with ailments, conscious
of age, slowing in mind, hesi- tant in will, he could no longer draw
from the elixir of victory the zest for combat, or the appetite for
government. How could this tired man find in this tired nation the human
resources demanded by the mounting onrush of his enemies?</p>
<p>Pride gave him his last power. That faithless Czar, that comely
dancer playing general; that frightened weakling tying the great
Frederick’s army to a Cossack horde; that turncoat French marshal
proposing to lead a Swed- ish army against his native land — they would
never match the gay courage and quick skill of a French soldier, the
passionate strength of a nation chal- lenged to defend those hard-won
natural boundaries which guarded the finest civilization in Europe.
“From now on,” said Napoleon in December, 1812, in a desperate appeal to
racial pride, “Europe has only one enemy— the Russian colossus.” 7</p>
<p>So he levied taxes, negotiated loans, and drew on his cellar hoard.
He issued orders to put the conscript “class” of 1813 into active
service, to pre- script the class of 1814 for training, to prepare for
foreign service the “co - horts” or militia that had been pledged to
only domestic needs, to commis - sion contracts for ammunition,
clothing, weapons, horses, food. He arranged for teaching the new levies
the arts and discipline of drill and march and batde; for stationing the
trained battalions at specified encampments; for holding them ready to
unite, at command, at a given place and time. By mid- April of 1813 he
had organized an army of 225,000 men. He appointed Marie Louise regent,
during his absence at the front; gave her his tried and tired secretary,
Meneval; and left Paris on April 1 5 to meet his armies on the Main and
the Elbe.</p>
<p>Eugene marched south with the remnants salvaged from the Russian
debacle, reinforced with troops called from their stations in Germany.
Gen- eral Bertrand came up from the south. With these trusted men
leading his left and right wings, Napoleon moved forward with his Army
of the Main, and on May 2, at Liitzen, near Leipzig, met an Allied army
under the com-</p>
<p>7 1 6 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>mand of the Russian General Wittgenstein and under the eyes of Czar
and King. The French now numbered 150,000, the Russians 58,000, the
Prussians 45,000. Perhaps to encourage his recruits, the Emperor,
savoring once more the thrills of combat, repeatedly risked himself at
the front of the action; “this was probably the day in all his career,”
wrote Marshal Marmont, “on which he ran the worst direct dangers on the
field of battle.” 8 The Allies acknowledged defeat, and retired by
Meissen and Dresden; but the victori- ous French had lost 20,000 men —
8,000 more than their foes. 9 Napoleon was in part consoled by the
decision of Frederick Augustus I, king of Saxony- worried neighbor of
esurient Prussia — to add his army of 10,000 to the French. On May 9 his
capital, Dresden, became Napoleon’s headquarters between campaigns.</p>
<p>Fearing that Austria would join the Allies to try to recapture north
Italy, Napoleon sent Eugene to Milan to rebuild his army there and keep
an eye on Italian revolutionists. He himself left Dresden on May 1 8,
hoping to achieve a more decisive victory against the Allies, who had
regrouped at Bautzen, thirty miles east of Dresden. He dispatched Ney to
march in a half circle around them and attack them in the rear, while he
himself would lead his main army in a frontal assault. Ney took his
time, and joined the battle too late to prevent the Allies, defeated by
Napoleon, from retreating into Silesia after losing 15,000 men. Napoleon
advanced to the Oder, freed the French garrison at Glogau, and added its
men to his army. Roger de Damas, an emigre, w rote in anger: “The French
Empire has met the crisis and emerged triumphant.” 10</p>
<p>At this moment, when he might have moved along the Oder, freed other
garrisons, and added their trained men to his army, Napoleon listened to
Metternich offering the mediation of Austria in arranging peace.
Berthier for the Emperor’s generals, Caulaincourt for his diplomats,
urged him to accept, fearing a long war by a united coalition with
endless resources against a divided and depleted France. Napoleon
suspected a trick, but hoped that an armistice would give him time to
gather another crop of conscripts, and reinforcements for his cavalry;
and he feared that a refusal would lead Austria into the Allied camp. An
armistice was arranged at Pleisswitz (June 4) for two months, later
extended till August io. Napoleon withdrew his forces to Dresden, issued
directions for the replenishment of his bat- talions, and went to Mainz
to spend some time with Marie Louise; perhaps she could persuade her
father to maintain the alliance of which she was a pledge. Meanwhile
Metternich enlarged and provisioned the Austrian Army, alleging fear of
the Allies.</p>
<p>These made good use of the armistice. They welcomed Bernadotte, who
now committed his army of 25,000 men to the cause. With him came Moreau,
who, convicted of friendly association with the plotters of Napo- leon’s
death, had been allowed to emigrate to America; now he offered his
services to. the Allies as one who knew the secrets of Napoleon’s
strategy. He stressed one rule: avoid battle when Napoleon is
commanding, seek it when he is away. The Allies were more pleased with
Lord Cathcart, who,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) TOELBA 717</p>
<p>on June 15, gave them a subsidy of four million pounds in return for
a pledge to make no peace with Napoleon without England’s consent.
11</p>
<p>On June 27 the Allies, accepting Austria’s mediation, agreed that
all</p>
<p>hree parties should send negotiators to Prague to arrange terms of
peace. Napoleon sen t Narbonne and Caulaincourt, hoping that Alexander’s
fond - ness for the latter, watched by the former, would incline the
Czar to accom- modations. In any case the terms offered to Napoleon
through Caulaincourt and Metternich were what he might have considered
reasonable in view of his defeat in Russia and Poland and the revolt of
Prussia. He was asked to surrender all territory that he had taken from
Prussia, and all claim to the duchy of Warsaw, the Hanseatic
city-states, Pomerania, Hanover, Illyria, and the Confederation of the
Rhine. He could go back to France with her natural boundaries still
preserved, and his throne and dynasty still unchal- lenged. There was a
serious flaw in the proposal: England had reserved the right to make
additional demands, and no peace could be signed without her
consent.</p>
<p>Napoleon sent to Prague a request for the Allies’ official
confirmation of these terms. It reached him only on August 9, with a
warning from Metter- nich that the congress and the armistice would
expire at midnight of Au- gust 10; and that Napoleon’s acceptance must
be received before that time. Napoleon sent a conditional acceptance,
which did not reach Prague until Metternich had declared the congress
and the armistice ended. On August r 1 Austria joined the coalition
against France, and the war was resumed.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>TO THE RHINE</li>
</ol>
<p>So expanded and financed, the Allies now had some 492,000 men in
arms, with 1,383 cannon; Napoleon, having received a contingent from
Denmark, and the new conscripts he had waited for, had 440,000 troops
and 1,200 pieces of artillery. The Allies formed three armies: an “Army
of the North,” under Bernadotte, centered in Berlin; an “Army of
Silesia,” under the impetuous and undiscourageable Blucher, formed
around Breslau; and the largest of the three, the “Army of Bohemia,”
under Prince von Schwar - zenberg, focused in Prague. Together they
formed a half circle covering Napoleon at Dresden; separately each of
the three was free to fight its own way to Paris. Against these Napoleon
opposed an “Army of the Left,” under Oudinot, to hold Bernadotte; an
“Army of the Center,” under Ney, to watch Blucher; and an “Army of the
Right,” under himself, to guard the roads by which Schwarzenberg might
let loose an avalanche of men from Bohemia. There were discouraging but
apparently unavoidable defects in the French position: Napoleon could
not use his fine Italian scheme of concentrating his whole force on one
of his enemies at one time, since this would leave the road to Paris
open to the others; two of his armies had to manage without the spur of
his presence and the quick versatility of his tactical skill.</p>
<p>7 i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>On August 12 Bliicher opened the fall campaign of 1813 by moving
west- ward from Breslau to attack Ney’s divisions at the Katzbach in
Saxony. Ney’s men were caught napping, perhaps literally, and fled in
panic. Napo - leon rushed up from Gorlitz with his Im perial Guard and
Murat’s cavalry, re- formed Ney’s troops, and led them to a victory that
cost Bliicher 6,000 men. 12 But at the same time Schwarzenberg led his
200,000 men north in a dash to seize the French headquarters at Dresden.
Napoleon turned back from the pursuit of Bliicher, led 100,000 men 120
miles in four days, and found the Austrians holding almost all the
heights around the Saxon capital. On August 26 the French army, led by
the Old Guard and the Young Guard, crying “ Vive I’Empereur!” broke
through the enemy lines, and fought so ferociously — Murat leading his
cavalry with his old-time reckless- ness — that, after two days of
combat, Schwarzenberg ordered a retreat, leav- ing 6,000 of his men
dead, disabled, or captured. Napoleon himself had directed some
batteries in the thickest of the fire. 13</p>
<p>Alexander, from an exposed hill, had watched the conflict with his
new favorite, Moreau, beside him. A cannonball shattered both of
Moreau’s legs. A few d ays later he died, in the arms of the Czar, but
crying out, “I, Moreau, struck by a French shot, and dying amid the
enemies of France!” 14</p>
<p>Vandamme pursued the retreating Austrians, was not followed and sup-
ported by Napoleon (who had been stricken with violent gastric pains),
fell into a trap, and surrendered his 7,000 men to one of
Schwarzenberg’s di - visions (August 28). Soon afterward Ney lost 15,000
men in an engagement at Dennewitz (September 6). Napoleon mourned to see
his victory at Dres- den so annulled. He sent orders to the Senate to
call up 120,000 conscripts from the class of 1814, and 160,000 from the
class of 1815. These were youngsters who would need many months of
training. At the same time 60,000 Russian troops, hardened by a campaign
in Poland, were added to Alexander’s army; and on October 8 the Bavarian
Army, previously support - ing Napoleon, joined his foes.</p>
<p>So strengthened, the Allies now aimed to capture Leipzig, and to
decide the war in a battle where their united forces would prevail over
any Na- poleonic strategy. In October 160,000 men — led by Bliicher,
Bennigsen, Bemadotte, Schwarzenberg, Eugen of Wiirttemberg, and other
generals — converged upon the city. Napoleon brought up his armies from
north, cen- ter, and south, 115,000 men in all, under Marmont, Alexandre
Macdonald, Augereau, Bertrand, Kellermann, Victor, Murat, Ney, and
Prince Jozef Poniatowski. Rarely had so much military genius, or so many
nationalities, met on any one field; this, as the Germans called it, was
the Volkerschlacht — the Battle (literally the Slaughter) of the
Nations.</p>
<p>Napoleon took his stand in an exposed position in the rear of his
forces, and directed their movements during the three days of the action
(October 16-19, 1813). According to his own account, 15 the French had
the upper hand until October 18, when the Saxon troops went over to the
Allies and then turned their guns upon the French, who, surprised and
confused, be- gan to give ground. On the next day the contingents from
the Confederation</p>

<p>of the Rhine defected to the Allies. Seeing that his men, apparently
running out of ammunition, 16 were suffering enormous losses, Napoleon
ordered them to retreat across the Rivers Pleisse and Elster. Most of
them succeeded in this, but an excited engineer blew up a bridge over
the Elster while some of the French were crossing; many were drowned,
including the gallant Poniatowski, who had fought so well that Napoleon
had made him a mar- shal on the battlefield. Only 60,000 of the 1 1
5,000 who had fought for Na- poleon at Leipzig reached the River Saale;
thousands fell prisoners, and 120,000 French troops left in German
fortresses were lost to France. Those of the retreating French who
reached the Saale received food and clothing and supplies. Then they
made their way westward to the Main at Hanau; there they fought and
defeated a force of Austrians and Bavarians; and on November 2, after
two weeks of flight, they reached the Rhine at Mainz, and crossed the
river into France.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>TO THE BREAKING POINT</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon seemed ruined beyond recovery. Not counting French soldiers
immobilized in Germany, his army now consisted of 60,000 defeated and
exhausted men huddled near the Rhine, “a mass of stragglers without
arms, without clothes, bearing about them the germs of typhus fever,
with which they infected every place through which they passed.” 17 From
every direc - tion came discouraging news. In Italy Eugene had by great
effort raised a force of 36,000 men, but was now confronted by 60,000
Austrian troops across the Adige. In Naples Murat was plotting to save
his throne by de- fecting to the Allies. In the Netherlands a domestic
revolt, aided by a Prussian division under Biilow, overthrew French rule
(November, 1813); English troops took control of the Scheldt; the house
of Orange was re- stored. Jerome had fled from Westphalia. From Spain
the triumphant Wel- lington crossed the Bidassoa into France (October
7); in December he laid siege to Bayonne.</p>
<p>France itself seemed to be falling to pieces. The loss of Spain, the
inter- ruption of trade with Germany and Italy, had brought an economic
crisis with factories closing and banks failing. In October the closing
of the bank- ing house of Jabach set off a series of bankruptcies. The
stock market fell from 80 in January, 1813, to 47 in December. Thousands
of unemployed roamed the streets, or concealed their poverty in their
homes, or joined the Army to eat. The common people rebelled against
further conscrip- tion; the middle class protested against higher taxes;
the royalists called for Louis XVIII; all classes demanded peace.</p>
<p>Napoleon reached Paris on November 9, and was welcomed by his un-
happy Queen and his rejoicing son. He set about raising a new army of
300,000 men as the first necessity for either war or peace. He sent
engineers to repair roads to new fronts, to restore town walls, to build
fortresses, to prepare to cut dikes or demolish bridges if necessary to
slow an invader’s</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>advance. He conscripted horses for the cavalry, ordered cannon from
the foundries, arms and munitions for the infantry; and as public
revenues fell because of poverty and resistance to taxation, he delved
more and more deeply into his cellar hoard. The nation looked on in
wonder and fear, ad- miring his resilience and resourcefulness, dreading
another year of war. The Allies, hesitant before the Rhine and winter,
sent to him from Frank- furt, on November 9, an informal unsigned offer
of peace: France was to retain her natural frontiers — the Rhine, the
Alps, the Pyrenees — but was to surrender all claim to anything beyond
them. 18 On December 2 Napoleon replied through Caulaincourt, minister
for foreign affairs, giving his official consent. However, the
revolution in Holland ended French control of the mouths of the Rhine;
the Allies aided this revolution, and withdrew their ac- ceptance of
natural frontiers for France. 19 Instead they issued (December 5) the
“Declaration of Frankfurt”: “The Allied Powers are not making war on
France. The Sovereigns desire France to be great, strong, and happy….
The Powers confirm the French Empire in the possession of an extent of
ter- ritory that it never possessed under its kings.” 20</p>
<p>Not much was needed to separate the people from the Emperor. The Sen-
ate and the Legislature were in open revolt against him, demanding a
con- stitution with guarantees of freedom. On December 21 the Allies
crossed the Rhine into France. On December 29 the Senate sent Napoleon
its as- surances of loyalty and support. But on the same day Laine,
member from royalist Bordeaux, read to the Legislature a report
criticizing the “mistakes” and “excesses” of the imperial
administration, praising “the happy sway of the Bourbons,” and
congratulating the Allies on “wishing to keep us within the limits of
our own territory, and to repress an ambitious activity which for the
last twenty years has been so fatal to all the peoples of Europe.” 21
The Legislature voted, 223 to 31, to have Laine’s report printed. That
eve - ning Napoleon ordered the session closed.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1814, the Legislature sent him a delegation to wish him
the compliments of the season. He replied with an outburst of
accumulated anger and fatigue:</p>
<p>“Surely, when we have to drive the enemy from our frontiers, it is
not time to ask me for a constitution. You are not the representatives
of the nation, you are merely the deputies sent by the departments…. I
alone am the representa- tive of the people. After all, what is the
throne? Four pieces of gilt wood cov- ered with velvet? No! The throne
is a man, and that man is myself. It is I who can save France, and not
you! If I were to listen to you I would surrender to the enemy more than
he is demanding. You shall have peace in three months, or I shall
perish.” 22</p>
<p>After the shocked delegates had left him Napoleon sent for some
selected senators, explained his policy and his negotiations for peace,
and concluded with a humble confession as if before the judgment seat of
history:</p>
<p>“I do no t fear to acknowledge that I have made war too long. I had
con- ceived vast projects; I wished to secure to France the empire of
the world. I was mistaken; those projects were not proportioned to the
numerical force of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>TO ELBA</p>
<p>721</p>
<p>our population. I should have been obliged to put them all under
arms; and I now perceive that the advancement of society, and the moral
and social well- being of a state, are not compatible with converting an
entire people into a nation of soldiers.</p>
<p>“I ought to expiate the fault I have committed in reckoning too much
on my good fortune; and I will expiate it. I will make peace. I will
make it in such terms as circumstances demand, and this peace shall be
mortifying to me alone. It is I who have deceived myself; it is I who
ought to suffer, it is not France. She has not committed any error; she
has poured forth her blood for me; she has not refused me any
sacrifice….</p>
<p>“Go, then, gentlemen, announce to your departments that I am about to
conclude a peace, that I shall no longer require the blood of Frenchmen
for my enterprises, for myself,… but for France, and to maintain the
integrity of her frontiers. Tell them that I ask only the means of
repelling a foreign foe from our native land. Tell them that Alsace,
Franche-Comte, Navarre, Bearn are being invaded. Tell them that I call
upon Frenchmen to come to the aid of Freedom.” 23</p>
<p>On January 21 he ordered his agents to release Pope Pius VII from
Fon- tainebleau, and arrange for his return to Italy. On January 23 he
assembled in the Tuileries the officers of the National Guard, presented
to them the Empress and the “King of Rome” (a handsome boy not yet three
years old), and recommended them to the care of the Guard. Once again,
he appointed Marie Louise regent during his absence, this time with his
brother Joseph as lieutenant general of the empire and administrator for
the Empress. On the 24th he was notified that Murat had gone over to the
Allies, and was march- ing up from Naples with eighty thousand men to
aid in expelling Eugene from Italy. On that day he bade goodbye to wife
and son, whom he was never to see again, and left Paris to join his
reconstituted army and chal- lenge the invaders of France.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>TO PARIS</li>
</ol>
<p>They were again advancing on converging lines, this time with their
eyes on Paris. Schwarzenberg literally stole a march on the French by
crossing the Rhine at Basel with 160,000 men, violating Swiss neutrality
with the happy connivance of Bernese oligarchs; moving rapidly through
the cantons, taking undefended Geneva, and emerging into France a
hundred miles far- ther west than the French had expected; and hurrying
north toward Nancy in the hope of joining Bliicher, or coordinating with
him there. Napoleon had ordered French armies to drop their local
campaigns in Italy and south- east France and march north to intercept
Schwarzenberg, or at least slow his advance; but Eugene was tied up by
Austrians, and Soult had his hands full with Wellington.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bliicher, with his “Army of Silesia” still 60,000 strong,
crossed the Rhine at Mainz, Mannheim, and Coblenz, and advanced almost
unop- posed to Nancy, whose rulers and populace received him and his
Prussian troops as deliverers from Napoleonic tyranny. 24 Bernadotte,
having lost his</p>
<p>?22</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>hope of being chosen to succeed Bonaparte, had left the Allies after
Leipzig, to beat the Danes into ceding Norway to Sweden (January 14,
1814); that done, he and his army joined Blucher in the drive on
Paris.</p>
<p>The French forces that Napoleon had left in eastern France dared not
confront either Blucher or Schwarzenberg. Ney retreated west from Nancy,
Mortier from Langres, Marmont from Metz, and awaited the coming of
Napoleon.</p>
<p>He brought with him, to his new headquarters at Chalons-sur-Mame
(only ninety-five miles from Paris), some 60,000 recruits; adding these
to the 60,000 survivors of Leipzig under Ney, Marmont, and Mortier, he
had a total of 120,000 with whom to stop Blucher and Schwarzenberg’s
total of 220,000. He was limited to a policy of keeping the Allied
armies from merg- ing, avoiding confrontation with Schwarzenberg, and
stopping or delaying their advance upon Paris by nibbling victories won
over Allied divisions caught off guard or far enough away from their
central command to be attacked without engaging their main forces. The
campaign of 1814 was one of Napoleon’s most brilliant in strat egy, but
also — because of the dearth of reinforcements — one of the most costly
in mistakes. Blucher too made many mistakes, but he was the most
indomitable and resourceful of all those generals who now or later
opposed Napoleon. Schwarzenberg was more cautious, pardy by temperament,
pardy because he carried Czar Alexander and Emperor Francis II in his
train.</p>
<p>Some initial victories gave Napoleon undue confidence. He caught Blu-
cher ’s men dining or napping at Brienne (January 29, 1814), defeated
the m, and came near to capturing Blucher himself. They retreated, and
Napoleon was too wise to follow them, for his own army had lost 4,000
men, and he too had a narrow escape: a Prussian was approaching him with
drawn saber when General Gourgeaud shot the impertinent fellow dead.
Napoleon grieved over the damage the batde had done to the town and its
famous school, where he had received his scientific education and his
military train- ing; he promised to restore them after the invaders had
been driven from France. 25</p>
<p>He had litde time for reminiscence; Schwarzenberg had rushed up to
buttress Blucher, and suddenly Napoleon’s 46,000 victors found
themselves almost surrounded by 100,000 Austrians, Prussians, and
Russians at La Rothiere (February 1). Napoleon had no choice but to
fight; he so ordered, and commanded in person. The battle was almost
equal, but equal losses were disastrous for the French, and the Emperor
led them in retreat to Troyes. Blucher, restless with Schwarzenberg’s
cautious advance, separated from him and decided to follow his own route
and pace to Paris via the Marne while the Austrians proceeded along the
Seine. Allied officers were so confident of victory that they made
engagements to meet at the Palais-Royal in the com- ing week. 28</p>
<p>After giving his wounded army a week’s rest, Napoleon assigned part
of it to Victor and Oudinot to retard Schwarzenberg, and himself marched
with 60,000 men through the swamps of St.-Gond as a shortcut to
Champau-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>TO ELBA</p>
<p>7 2 3</p>
<p>bert. There they caught up with Bliicher’s rear, and Marmont led the
French to a decisive victory (February io). Pushing on, they met, a day
later, another portion of Bliicher’s army at M ontmirail; Napoleon and
Blii- cher were both present, but Marmont again was the hero. On
February 14 the main forces clashed in a larger combat at Vauchamps, and
Napoleon guided his now more confident army to victory. In four days
Bliicher had lost 30,000 men. 27 Napoleon sent 8,000 prisoners to be
paraded through Paris to restore the morale of the citizens. 28</p>
<p>However, Schwarzenberg had meanwhile driven back Oudinot and Vic- tor
almost to Fountainbleau; one full-scale attack could have brought the
Austro- Russian army, and its two Emperors, within a day’s march of
Paris. Shocked by report of this setback, which canceled all his
victories, Napo- leon, leaving Marmont to at least harass Bliicher,
dashed south with 70,000 men, caught an Allied army under Wittgenstein
at Montereau, defeated it (February 18), took a position at Nangis, and
sent Victor and Oudinot to attack Schwarzenberg in flank and rear.
Finding himself in danger on three sides, the Austrian general thought
it an opportune time to suggest an armis- tice to Napoleon. The Emperor
replied that he would agree to a cease-fire only if it pledged the
Allies to the Frankfurt offer — which left France its natural
boundaries. The Allies, insulted by this proposal that they should
retreat behind the Rhine, ended the negotiations, and, in defiance, at
Chau- mont on March 9, confirmed their alliance for twenty years.
Schwarzenberg retired to Troyes, still commanding 100,000 men.</p>
<p>Napoleon, with 40,000, pursued him cautiously. Meanwhile he learned
that Bliicher had re-formed his forces, and was again making a path to
Paris with 50,000 men. Leaving Oudinot, Macdonald, and Etienne-Maurice
Gerard to trouble Schwarzenberg, he marched his men back from the Seine
to the Marne, and joined Marmont and Mortier in the hope of trapping
Bliicher at the River Aisne, where the Prussian’s only escape would be
by a bridge to Soissons. But two other Allied armies, 50,000 men, moved
down from the north upon Soissons, and frightened its commandant to
surrender the city and the bridge. Bhicher’s forces crossed the bridge,
burned it, and united with their rescuers to total 100,000 troops.
Napoleon pursued them with 50,000 men, fought them indecisively at
Craonne, and was defeated by them in a savage conflict of two days at
Laon (March 9-10).</p>
<p>It did not help him much that on March 1 3, finding another Prussian
army in possession of Reims, he drove out the invaders and received a
heartening welcome from the populace. Then, leaving Marmont and Mortier
to face Bliicher, he again marched from one enemy to the other, and at
Arcis-sur- Aube, on March 20, in a madness of fury, launched his
remaining 20,000 men against Schwarzenberg’s army, still 90,000 strong.
After two days of heroic massacre he acknowledged defeat, and crossed
the Aube to find a place where his depleted army could rest.</p>
<p>He was again at the end of his rope. His exhaustion of flesh and
nerves re- vealed itself in his hot temper, his angry scolding of
officers who had risked their lives for him in war after war. They
warned him that he could expect</p>
<p>7 2 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON ’</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>no reinforcements to reach him from a nation bled to apathy and tired
of la gloire. The government that he had left in Paris — even his
brother Joseph — was sending him appeals to make peace at any price.</p>
<p>In his desperation he decided to risk everything on one more dash of
imaginative strategy. He would leave his best generals to halt the
Allied advance as well as they could; he himself, with a modest force,
would march eastward, release the French soldiers immured in German
fortresses along the Rhine, add those veteran troops to his batter- ed
regiments, cut the Allies’ lines of communication and supplies, attack
their rear guards, and force them to halt in their march; so Paris,
again inspired by his courage, might build its defenses, and defy the
invaders. In a saner moment he sent instructions to Joseph that if
surrender should be imminent, the government, with Marie Louise and the
King of Rome, should be removed to some security behind the Loire, where
all available French troops could gather for a last stand.</p>
<p>While Napoleon led his wondering survivors eastward, the Allies broke
down, day by day, the resistance offered by the remains of the French
army, and moved closer to the end of their long journey. Francis II
stayed behind at Dijon, not willing to share in the humiliation of his
daughter. Frederick William III, usually so mild, felt that he might
justly take revenge for the destruction of his army, the dismemberment
of his country, and has years of exile from his capital. Alexander,
proud and tense, taking no plea- sure in the daily slaughter, saw
himself as fulfilling the vow he had made at Vilna to cleanse Russia of
Moscow’s defilement, and to free Europe from the power madness of the
Corsican.</p>
<p>On March 25 Marmont and Mortier made a desperate attempt to stop the
Allies, at La Fere-Champenoise, a hundred miles from Paris. Outnum-
bered two to one, they fought with such carelessness of death that Alex-
ander himself, advancing into the melee, commanded the uneven slaughter
to stop, crying, 11 Je veux sauver c es braves!”; and after the combat
ended the victors restored to the defeated generals their horses and
swords. 29 Mar- mont and Mortier retreated to Paris to prepare the
defense of the capital.</p>
<p>Bliicher and Schwarzenberg reached the outskirts of Paris on March
29. The sound of their cannon, and the sight of peasants fleeing into
the city, created panic among the citizens, and tremors among the x
2,000 militiamen — most of them armed only with pikes — who were now
called upon to aid the residual army in manning the forts and hills of
the capital. Joseph had long since begged the Empress-Regent to leave
the city as Napoleon had directed; now she obeyed; but “L’Aiglon”
resisted until frightened by the noise of the approaching battle.</p>
<p>On March 30th 70,000 of the invaders began the final attack. Marmont
and Mortier, with 25,000 men, defended as well as they could a city that
the proud Emperor had never thought of fortifying. Old soldiers from Les
Invalides, students from the Lcole Polytechnique, workingmen and other
volunteers, joined the defense. Joseph watched the resistance until he
saw that it was useless and might invite the destructive bombardment of
a city</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>TO ELBA</p>
<p>725</p>
<p>hat was dear to its rich and poor alike. Though Alexander might
behave with commiseration and charity, the Cossacks might escape
control, and Blucher was not the man to keep his Prussian cohorts from
taking full re- venge. So Joseph transferred his authority to the
marshals, and left to join Marie Louise and the French government at
Blois on the Loire. Marmont, after a day of bloody resistance, saw no
sense in continuing it, and signed the capitulation of the city at 2
a.m. of March 31, 1814.</p>
<p>Later that morning Alexander, Frederick William III, and
Schwarzenberg led 50,000 soldiers in formal entry into Paris. The people
greeted them with silent hostility, but the Czar softened them with
undiscouraged courtesy and repeated salutations. 80 When the ceremonies
were over he sought out Talley- rand in the Rue St.-Florentin, and asked
his advice on how to arrange an orderly change of the French government.
They agreed that the Senate should reconvene, that it should draw up a
constitution, and should appoint a provisional government. The Senate
met on April 1, composed a constitu- tion guaranteeing fundamental
liberties, appointed a provisional government, and chose Talleyrand as
its president. On April 2 the Senate declared Napo- leon deposed.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>TO PEACE</li>
</ol>
<p>He was at St.-Dizier, 150 miles from Paris, when the news reached him
(March 27) that the Allies were investing the city. He set out with his
army the next morning. That afternoon he received a more urgent message:
“The presence of the Emperor is necessary if he wishes to prevent his
capital from being delivered to the enemy. There is not a moment to
lose.” He left his army at Troyes and rode most of the remaining miles
on horseback, ailments notwithstanding. Nearing Paris (March 31), he
said to Caulain- court, “I shall put myself at the head of the National
Guard and the Army; we shall reestablish things.” He was shocked to be
informed that it was too late; the capitulation had been signed that
morning. He sent Caulaincourt to Paris in the hope that this “Russian”
might persuade Alexander to a compromise settlement. Fearing arrest if
he himself entered the city, the Emperor rode on to Fontainebleau.
There, that evening, he received word from Caulaincourt: “I am
repulsed.” 81 On April 2 he learned that he had been deposed. He thought
for a moment how pleasant it might be to yield. “I do not cling to the
throne,” he said; “bom a soldier, I can without com - plaint become a
citizen.” But the arrival of his arm y, still numbering 50,000 men, 82
struck a more congenial chord in his nature. He bade it pitch its camp
along the River Essonne (a tributary of the Seine), and hold itself
ready for further orders. To this camp Marmont led the survivors of the
troops that had defended Paris.</p>
<p>On April 3 Napoleon reviewed the Imperial Guard in the court of the
Fontainebleau Palace. He told them, “I have offered the Emperor
Alexander</p>
<p>72 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>a peace sought by great sacrifices…. He has refused…. In a few days I
shall go to attack him in Paris. I count on you.” At first they made no
answer, but when he asked them, “Am I right?” they responded, “ Vive
VEmpereur! A Paris/” and the grenadiers’ band struck up the old revolu -
tionary anthems “Le Chant du depart” and “La Marseillaise.”</p>
<p>The generals were skeptical. In private conference with them he found
them opposed to a Bourbon restoration, but cold to an attempt to drive
the Allies out of Paris. On April 4 Marshals Ney, Oudinot, Moncey,
and</p>
<p>Lefebvre entered his room uninvited, and told him that since the
Senate had deposed him they could not follow him in an attack upon the
Allied forces and the Provisional Government. He answered that he would
lead the Army without them. Ney retorted, “The Army will obey its
leaders.” Napoleon asked what they wanted him to do. Ney and Oudinot
answered, “Abdicate.” Napoleon wrote a conditional abdication, leaving
the throne to his son under the regency of Marie Louise. He sent
Caulaincourt, Macdon- ald, and Ney to Paris to present this offer. On
the way they stopped at the Essonne camp to consult Marmont, and were
startled to find that he had been negotiating privately with
Schwarzenberg for terms of surrender. That night (April 4-5) Marmont led
his 11,000 men across the city line in full acceptance of
Schwarzenberg’s easy terms. On April 5 the Allied leaders notified
Caulaincourt that there would be no further dealings with Napoleon until
he had abdicated unconditionally. Meanwhile they sent troops to sur-
round Fontainebleau and prevent his escape.</p>
<p>Alexander graced these severities by protecting Paris from pillage,
and paying courtesy visits to Marie Louise, Josephine, and Hortense. The
Rus- sian was the most civilized of the conquerors. He persuaded his
colleagues to sign with him the “Treaty of Fontainebleau,” which offered
Napoleon an island in the Mediterranean as a spacious prison, brightened
with an Italian sky and a French income. The essential text:</p>
<p>His Majesty the Emperor Napoleon on the one part, and their Majesties
the Emperor of Austria,… the Emperor of all the Russias, and the King of
Prussia, stipulating in their own names and those of all their Allies on
the other…</p>
<p>Article I. His Majesty the Emperor Napoleon renounces for himself,
his successors, and descendants, as well as for all the members of his
family, all rights of sovereignty and dominion as well in the French
Empire as… in every other country.</p>
<p>Article II. Their Majesties the Emperor Napoleon and Empress Marie
Louise shall retain their titles and rank to be enjoyed during their
lives. The mother, brothers, sisters, nephews, and nieces of the Emperor
shall also retain, wherever they reside, the titles of Princes of the
Emperor’s Family.</p>
<p>Article III. The Island of Elba, adopted by his Majesty the Emperor
Napo- leon as his place of residence, shall form during his life a
separate principality, which shall be possessed by him in full
sovereignty and property.</p>
<p>There shall besides be granted, in full property to the Emperor
Napoleon, an annual revenue of 2,000,000 francs in rent charge, in the
great book of France, of which 1,000,000 shall be in reversion to the
Empress. 33</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI )</p>
<p>TO ELBA</p>
<p>727</p>
<p>Napoleon signed this on April 13, and signed his First Abdication;
the Allies then signed the treaty. He had hoped for Corsica as his
island of exile, but knew that this, a very incubator of revolt, would
not be allowed, and Elba had been his own second choice. 34 Marie Louise
was not permitted to go with him there. She had tried to join him at
Fontainebleau, but the Allies had forbidden this, and Napoleon had
discouraged it. 35 On April 27, unwillingly, she and her son left
Rambouillet for Vienna.</p>
<p>Perhaps Napoleon had dissuaded her from coming to him because he had
decided to kill himself. As before noted, he had been given a phial of
poison by Dr. Yvan on the return from Russia. On the night of April
12-13 he swallowed the contents. Apparently the poison had lost
efficacy; Napoleon suffered, but recovered, much to his shame. He
excused his continuance by proposing to write an autobiography that
would give his side of the story, and would celebrate the deeds of li
mes braves.”™</p>
<p>On April 16 he wrote a farewell to Josephine: “Never forget him who
has never forgotten you and will never forget you.” 37 She died a month
later, May 29. On April 19 he bade goodbye to his valet Constant and his
Mameluke bodyguard Roustam. On the 20th he delivered les adieux to the
soldiers of the Old Guard, who had remained with him to the end:</p>
<p>“Soldiers, I bid you farewell. For twenty years that we have bee n
together your conduct has left me nothing to desire. I have always found
you on the road to glory…. With you and the brave men who still are
faithful, I might have carried on a civil war, but France would be
unhappy. Be faithful, then, to your new king, be obedient to your new
commanders, and desert not our beloved country.</p>
<p>“Do not lament my lot. I will be happy when I know that you are so. I
might have died;… if I consent to live it is still to promote your
glory. I will write the great things that we have achieved.</p>
<p>“I cannot embrace you all, but I embrace your general. Come, General
Petit,</p>
<p>Four hundred of the Guard chose to accompany him to Elba.</p>
<p>He stepped into a carriage with General Bertrand, who would stay with
him to the end. For assurance’ sake he was accompanied by four Allied
officers — Russian, Prussian, Austrian, English; and, for protection, a
small escort of French troops. 39 He needed protection as he passed
through Provence, where the population, strongly Catholic and partly
royalist, hurled insults at him as he passed. At Orgon, near Arles, he
saw himself hanging in effigy, and was threatened by a crowd; it
commanded him to say “ Vive le Roil” and he obeyed, as Louis XVI,
contrariwise, had done. There - after, for safety, he disguised himself
with a uniform and cloak lent him by Austrian and Russian officers. His
spirits were raised, April 26, by finding his sister Pauline waiting for
him at Le Luc. She had abandoned the French Riviera, and an invitation
to Rome, to stay at a little farmhouse. “The Em -</p>
<p>728</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>peror will shortly pass through here,” she wrote to Felice
Bacciocchi, “and I wish to see him and offer him my sympathy…. I have
not loved him because he was a sovereign, but because he is my brother.”
40 She refused to embrace him in his humiliating disguise; he discarded
it, and for four hours basked in her devotion.</p>
<p>On the 27th he proceeded to Frejus. There, on April 28, he was
received, with a salute of twenty-one guns, on board the British ship
Undaunted, and sailed for Elba. For the next nine months he would try
the healing simplici- ties of peace.</p>
<p>To Waterloo</p>
<p>1814-15</p>
<p>I. LOUIS XVIII</p>
<p>H E was the fourth — as Louis XVI was the third — son of Louis
the</p>
<p>Dauphin, son of Louis XV. Till 1791, when he was already thirty-</p>
<p>six, he was apparently content to be the Comte de Provence, handsome,
genial, enjoying and supporting literature, and contributing elegant
con- versation to the salon of his mistress. 1 When Louis XVI tried to
escape from France (1791) the Comte tried also, succeeded, and joined
his younger brother, the Comte d’Artois, at Brussels. When Louis XVII,
wasting away in imprisonment and grief, died at the age of ten (1795),
the Comte de Provence, as the next legitimate heir to the throne of
France, took the title of Louis XVIII, and considered himself the king
of France through all the years of the Revolution and Napoleon. As their
influence spread, Louis had to change his domicile from place to place —
from Germany to Russia to Poland to Russia to England ( 1 8 1 1 ). There
he was supported by the gov- ernment, and acquired a respect for the
British Constitution.</p>
<p>On April 14, 1814, the French Senate, led by Talleyrand, issued the
fol- lowing resolution:</p>
<p>In conformity with the proposition of the Provisional Government, and
the report of a special committee of seven members, the Senate resigns
the pro- visional government of France to His Royal Highness the Comte
d’Artois, with the title of Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, until
Louis-Stanislaus-Xavier, called to the throne of France, shall have
accepted the constitutional charter. 2</p>
<p>The constitution formulated by the Senate called for amnesty to the
sur- viving revolutionists, the prohibition of feudal dues and
ecclesiastical tithes, the confirmation of purchases made from
“national” property (confiscated from the Church and the emigres ), the
maintenance of a Chamber of Depu- ties and a House of Peers, and respect
for civil liberty and the sovereignty of the people.</p>
<p>Pleased by this invitation, disturbed by its conditions, Louis asked
time for consideration. On April 24 he left England for France. From
St.-Ouen, on May 2, he announced that he would respect most of the
proposed consti- tution, but had to reject the sovereignty of the people
as inconsistent with his hereditary rights as king by the grace of God.
He p roposed to “grant” to France and the Senate a “charter” instead of
a constitution. The Senate</p>
<p>730 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>would be a Chamber of Peers chosen by the king; the Corps Legislatif
would become a Chamber of Deputies elected by voters paying three hun-
dred or more francs annually in direct taxes; and these two chambers
were to control the revenues and expenditures of the government. Charmed
by the power of the purse, the two chambers accepted the charter, the
King pledged his cooperation, and the Bourbon Restoration began (June 4,
1814).</p>
<p>Amid this changing of the guards the Allied Powers, by the “First
Treaty</p>
<p>Settled down in the Tuileries, Louis XVIII felt that he had earned
the right to relax and enjoy the restitution of his property. He spoke
of 1814 as “the nineteenth year of my reign.” He was now fifty -nine
years old, genial and courteous, lazy and slow, fat and gouty, and not
every ounce a king. He resigned himself to constitutional government,
and complaisantly ad- justed himself to votes, oratory, factions, and a
press freer than under the Directory or Napoleon. Salons for the
discussion of literature and politics flourished. Mme. de Stael,
triumphant, resumed her Paris gatherings, and entertained kings.</p>
<p>More generally enjoyed by the people was the economic success of the
new regime. Louis had the good sense to leave unaltered the Napoleonic
Code, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, and the structure of the economy.
As Napoleon had been blessed in finding, for the vital Ministry of
Finance, a man of high competence and integrity in Francis Mollien, so
Louis XVIII found for the same office Baron Joseph-Dominique Louis, who
met promptly all obligations of the Treasury, and resisted all
temptations to fiscal chicanery.</p>
<p>The King’s court symbolized his efforts to smooth the tr ansition
between the two regimes. There was, in the first year of the reign,
little retaliation against those who had served Napoleon; the Emperor’s
marshals, excepting Davout, mingled freely with pedigreed royalists at
the Bourbon court. Mem- bers of the lower nobility, like M. and Mme. de
Remusat, who. had been favorites with Napoleon, rushed to worship at the
refurbished shrine. Talley- rand’s quip that the Bourbons had “learned
nothing and forgotten nothing” might have been true of the Comte d’ A
rtois — good-natured and good-look- ing, but foolishly proud; but it
could not justly be applied to Louis XVIII. Napoleon himself, at
St. Helena, testified to the rapidity with which most of the French
people accepted the ancien regime nouveau , as if falling readily into
old habits too long established to have been completely displaced.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were some elements of discord and discontent. The
Church repudiated the Concordat, and insisted on the restoration of her
pre-Revolution power, especially over education. A decree was obtained
from the King requiring strict religious observance of Sundays and
holydays; all shops except of chemists and herbalists were then to be
closed from morn- ing to evening, and no paid labor or business
transport was to be allowed. 3</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>731</p>
<p>It became dangerous not to profess Catholicism. Most troublesome of
all was the Church’s apparently reasonable demand that all ecclesia
stical prop- erty confiscated during the Revolution should be restored
to her. This de- mand could not be met without a revolt of the hundreds
of thousands of peasants, and members of the middle class, who had
bought such property from the state. The fear of these purchasers that
they might be dispossessed, in whole or in part, led many peasants, and
some solid bourgeois, to think they might welcome a Napoleon returning,
if cured of war.</p>
<p>A still active minority of the population cherished the principles of
the Revolution, and worked, however clandestinely, for its revival.
Severely repressed by the new regime, these “Jacobins” played with the
hope that a returned Napoleon might be forced, in order to overthrow the
Bourbon, to be again the Son of the Revolution. In the Army they made
many converts to this hope. The marshals were captivated by the
amiability of the King, but the officer class — seeing their visions of
advancement fading as the nobility resumed its old monopoly of the
higher posts — longed for a revival of the days when a marshal’s baton
could be won and awarded on the field and day of battle. Louis XVIII,
eager to balance the budget, had demobilized 18,000 officers and 300,000
privates; nearly all of these dismissed men, struggling to find a place
in the economy, idealized in memory the Emperor who had dealt out glory
as well as death, and had made even death seem glorious.</p>
<p>The discontent of the Army was the strongest of the forces that
opened a door for the return of the fascinating prodigal. Add a
peasantry fearing dispossession or a restoration of feudal dues;
manufacturers suffering from the influx of British goods; the discomfort
of all but the orthodox Catholics under the i ntensifying sway of the
clergy; the King’s dismissal of both chambers at the end of 1814 — not
to return till May; and a secret yearning of the poor for the excitement
and splendor of Napoleon’s France: these were frail and uncertain winds
of chance, but news of them, brought to Elba, raised the spirit of the
imprisoned gladiator, wounded but not dead.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA: SEPTEMBER, 1814- JUNE, 1 8 1 5</li>
</ol>
<p>It was the most distinguished political assemblage in European
history. Its dominant members were naturally the major victors in the
war of the nations: Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain; but
there were also delegates from Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, the
Papacy, Bavaria, Saxony, Wiirttemberg… ; and defeated France had to be
reckoned with, if only because she was represented by the wily
Talleyrand. The proceedings would illustrate two not quite contrary
principles: that guns speak louder than words, and that physical force
is seldom victorious unless manipulated by mental power.</p>
<p>Russia was represented primarily by Czar Alexander I, with the
largest army and the greatest charm. With the help of Count Andreas
Razumovsky (patron of Beethoven) and Count Karl Robert Nesselrode he
proposed that</p>
<p>73 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>Russia receive all Poland as reward for leading the Allies from
hesitation on the Niemen and the Spree to victory on the Seine; and
Prince Czartoryski, representing Poland by Alexander’s permission,
supported the proposal in hope that the reunification of Poland could be
a step toward independence.</p>
<p>Prussia was represented formally by King Frederick William III, more
actively by Prince von Hardenberg, with Wilhelm von Humboldt as phi-
losopher in attendance. They demanded a fit reward for the martial
leader- ship of “Vorwarts” Bliicher and the sacrifice of Prussian lives.
Alexander agreed, and — conditional on Prussia’s withdrawal of claim to
her former piece of Poland — offered Frederick William all of Saxony,
whose Kang (then imprisoned in Berlin) deserved this denudation for
having given the Saxon Army to Napoleon; and Freiherr vom Stein thought
this a gentlemanly so- lution.</p>
<p>Austria claimed that its declaration for the Allies had decided the
war, and that it should get a generous helping at the victors’ feast.
The exclusion of Austria from Poland was intolerable; and the
appropriation of Saxony by Prussia would throw out of all proportion the
European balance of power between north and south. Metternich deployed
all his patient, devious subtlety to keep Austria from being reduced to
a second-class Power. Em- peror Francis II aided his Minister for
Foreign Affairs by softening his guests with entertainment. His Treasury
had emerged from the war with one foot in bankruptcy; he risked the
remainder by intoxicating his guests with wine and champagne, and
dulling them with Neanderthal meals. The halls of the imperial palaces
sparkled almost nightly with lavish festivals. Actors and actresses,
singers and virtuosos were engaged to entrance the potentates and their
retainers; Beethoven shook the city with “Die Schlacht von Vittoria.”
Fair women wore fortunes on their dresses or in their hair, and
displayed as much of their software as a decent respect for Cardinal
Consalvi would allow. Mistresses were available for titled seekers, and
courtesans supplied the needs of minor notables. The town gossips had
trouble keeping account of the Czar’s amours. 4</p>
<p>Alexander won the women and lost the diplomatic war. Metternich
sought allies against him among the delegates of the minor Powers. He
argued that the principle of legitimacy forbade such spoliation of a
king as Russia and Prussia proposed in Saxony. They agreed, but how
could they talk principle to a Russia that had 500,000 troops quartered
on her western front? Metter- nich appealed to Lord Castlereagh, who
spoke for England: Would not England be uneasy with Russia reaching
through Poland and allied with a Prussia swollen with Saxony? What would
this do to the balance of power east and west? Castlereagh excused
himself; Britain was at war with the United States, and could not risk a
confrontation with Russia.</p>
<p>So Metternich turned as a last resort to Talleyrand. He had angered
the Frenchman by excluding France, along with the lesser Powers, from
the private conferences of the “Big Four,” and deferring to November 1,
1814, the first united assembly of all the attending states. Talleyrand
made common cause with other excluded delegations, and was soon accepted
as their spokes-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>733</p>
<p>man. So fortified, he began to speak of France as still a first-class
Power, ready to raise and supply an army of 300,000 men. Metternich, who
might have seen this as a threat, saw in it a possible promise. He
solicited Talley- rand’s help against Russia; Talleyrand secured Louis
XVIII’s consent; the two diplomats won over Castlereagh now that peace
had been made with America. On January 3, 1815, France, Austria, and
Great Britain formed a Triple Alliance for mutual aid in maintaining the
balance of power. Faced with this new consortium, Russia withdrew her
claim to all Poland; and Prussia, having regained Thorn and Posen,
agreed to take only two fifths of Saxony. Talleyrand received most of
the credit, and boasted that his di- plomacy had changed France from a
beaten beggar to again a major Power.</p>
<p>After almost nine months of bargaining, the assembled dignitaries, by
the “Act of the Congress of Vienna” dated June 8, 1815, redistributed
the soil of Europe according to the ancient principle that to the
victors belong the spoils — if the victors are still strong enough to
take them. Britain kept Malta as her sentry post in the central
Mediterranean; she established her pro- tectorate over the Ionian
Islands as guards over the Adriatic and the eastern Mediterranean; she
returned some, kept some (notably Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope) of
the French and Dutch colonies she had taken during the war. She
recovered control of Hanover, and arranged a close understanding with
the new kingdom of the Netherlands, which now embraced both “Holland”
and “Belgium,” and therefore the mouths of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Poland suffered a new partition, with some improvement. Prussia
received the regions around Posen and Danzig. Austria received Galicia.
Russia re- ceived the grand duchy of Warsaw, which was changed into the
kingdom of Poland under the czar as its king, and with a liberal
constitution.</p>
<p>Prussia came out of the war with gains that prepared her for
Bismarck: in addition to two fifths of Saxony she received Swedish
Pomerania and Riigen, and most of Westphalia; Neuchatel in Switzerland;
and a predominant in- fluence in the German Confederation which now
replaced Napoleon’s Con - federation of the Rhine. Saxony retained three
fifths of its former terrain, and recovered its King. Austria added, to
her pre-Congress lands, Salzburg, Illyria, Dalmatia, the Tirol, and the
“Lombardo - Venetian kingdom” in northern Italy. The Papal States were
returned to the Papacy; Tuscany reverted to the Hapsburg-Bourbon rule.
Finally, in a bow to Christianity, the Congress condemned the trade in
slaves.</p>
<p>During December and January, 1814 — 15, the Congress considered pro-
posals for further dealings with Napoleon. Surely (some delegates
suggested) that excitable man would not long rest content to be
sovereign of tiny Elba. And that island was uncomfortably close to Italy
and France. What deviltry might he stir if he should escape? Various
proposals were made to the Congress to send a force to Elba, seize
Napoleon, and deport him to a farther and safer isolation. Talleyrand
and Castlereagh thought so; Czar Alexander objected, and there the
matter rested. 5</p>
<p>734</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>The Congress was nearing its close when, early on the morning of
March 7, Metternich was awakened by a message marked “Urgent.” It was
from the Austrian consul at Genoa, and informed the Minister that
Napoleon had escaped from Elba. The delegates, notified, agreed to defer
the ending of the Congress and to remain at Vienna until some united
action could be agreed upon. On March 1 1 further word came that
Napoleon had landed near Antibes. On March 13 the Congress, through its
“Committee of the Eight,” pronounced against Napoleon a ban declaring
him an outlaw whom anyone might kill without fear or hindrance of the
law. The Congress had com- pleted its programs, but — though the
delegates now dispersed — it remained technically in session until June
19, when it was notified that Napoleon had been overwhelmed at Waterloo
the day before. The Congress thereupon declared itself officially at an
end.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ELBA</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon reached Elba’s Portoferraio on May 3, 1814. He landed the
next morning, amid the wild acclaim of the town’s population, which
thought that he was bringing millions of francs to spend; eight days
earlier they had hanged him in effigy as a man madly in love with war. 6
They escorted him to the governor’s palace, which would now take on
imperial dignity. For the next nine months he was to be emperor over
eighty-six square miles and twelve thousand souls. He surrounded himself
(partly, it may be, because he believed that display is half the game of
rule) with all the paraphernalia of majesty — uniforms, royal guard,
chamberlains, domestics, musicians, a hundred horses, twenty-seven
carriages. 7 On May 26 four hundred members of his Old Guard came to
serve him as the nucleus of a miniature army. Some two hundred
volunteers came from France, others from Italy or Corsica; altogether he
had soon about sixteen hundred men ready to fight off any attempt to
harm the hated and beloved Emperor. For further inviolability he
fortified the harbor and organized a fleet — one brig (the Inconstant)
and four small vessels, all armed.</p>
<p>How did he finance all this — and the public works and enterprises
with which he improved the island? The Treaty of Fontainebleau had
promised him an annuity from France, but it was not paid. 8 However,
Napoleon had brought with him 3,400,000 francs in silver and gold, and
he collected 400,000 lire annually in taxes and other revenues. After
half a year he began to wonder how he was going to meet his expenses if
he stayed there beyond a year.</p>
<p>For a time he was reasonably happy, considering his expansive ways.
On May 9 he wrote to Marie Louise: “I arrived here fifteen d ays ago. I
have had a pretty dwelling fixed up…. My health is perfect, the country
is agree- able. It lacks news from you, and the assurance that you are
well…. Goodbye, my beloved. Give a kiss to my son.” 9</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>735</p>
<p>Another son, with his mother the faithful Countess Walewska, was
among his early visitors. The sailors and citizens mistook her for the
Empress, and gave her a royal welcome. Napoleon was disturbed, since he
had hoped to have his wife and the “King of Rome” join him on the
island. He relaxed for a day or two in Walewska’s arms, 10 then lovingly
dismissed her for rea - sons of state. Perhaps Marie Louise received
some expanded gossip about those two days. 11</p>
<p>In October his mother and his sister Pauline came to stay with
him.</p>
<p>Pauline offered him her jewels, and asked pardon for Murat’s
disloyalty. Madame Mere gave him motherly care and comfort, and offered
him all her savings. She and Pauline remained with him though they
sorely missed the warm vitality of Italian life.</p>
<p>We can imagine how bored he was, after the first few months, with the
small scope and leverage that the little island could give to his
character and dreams. He tried to escape ennui by physical activity, but
almost daily some news from the mainland added to his restlessness.
Meneval, who was serving Marie Louise in Vienna, informed him of the
discussions in the Congress about removing him to a safer distance, 12
and added that the Con- gress would probably end by February 20. Other
informants told him of the discontent in the Army, the fears of the
peasantry, the agitations of the Jacobins, the enforcement of Catholic
worship. In February, 1815, Hugues Maret, Due de Bassano, sent him a
message via Fleury de Chaboulon, confirming all these reports. 13</p>
<p>Excited by them, and stirred with hopes for a nobler end than death
by inanition, he told his mother of his temptation, and asked for her
advice. She suspected that if she let him go now she would never see him
again. “Let me,” she said, “be a mother for a while, and then I will
give you my opinion.” But she knew that he had already decided for the
last gamble. “Go, my son,” she told him, “and fulfill your destiny.”
14</p>
<p>He felt that he must act soon. A little time more, and he would have
no means of his own to pay those thousand Frenchmen who were serving him
and must be maintained. The conditions had developed for an attempt to
regain his throne, defend it, and transmit it to his son, as beautiful
as Adonis, whom he would train to be a king. The Allies were disbanding
their Con- gress, and were going home with their troops; perhaps,
separately, they would be open to an appeal for peace. The nights were
still long; in the darkness his little fleet might escape detection, and
he would be again on the soil of France.</p>
<p>He prepared as inconspicuously as possible, but with his usual
foresight and thoroughness. He bade the Imperial Guard and eight hundred
grena- diers — eleven hundred men in all — pack their belongings, and be
on the dock on the evening of February 26 for a voyage of several days
to an unstated destination. Nevertheless they surmised that they were
bound for France, and they rejoiced.</p>
<p>On the appointed evening he embraced his mother and sister (who
would</p>
<p>73 &lt;&gt; THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>soon go to friends in Italy), joined his little regiment, boarded,
with it, the Inconstant and five other vessels, and sailed off quietly
in the dark. The winds did not favor them, sometimes leaving their
helpless fleet becalmed, sometimes driving it too near the shore; they
feared to be recognized and stopped and ignominiously jailed. For three
days they moved northward along the Italian coast, then westward past
Genoa and the French Riviera. En route those men who could write made
hundreds of copies of a proclama- tion composed by Napoleon, to be
distributed in France:</p>
<p>Frenchmen:</p>
<p>I have heard, in my exile, your lamentations and your prayers: you
long for the government that you chose, and which alone is lawful. I
have crossed the sea, and am coming to reclaim my rights, which are
yours. To the Army: your possessions, your rank, your glory, the
property, rank, and glory of your chil- dren, have no greater enemies
than those princes whom foreigners have im- posed upon you…. Victory
will march at full speed; the eagle, with the na- tional colors, will
fly from steeple to steeple, even to the towers of Notre- Dame. You will
be the liberators of your country. 15</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY: MARCH 1-20, 1 8 1 5</li>
</ol>
<p>• The little fleet, carrying “Caesar and his fortune,” sighted Cap d’
Antibes at dawn of March i. Soon after midday, in the Golfe Juan, the
eleven hun- dred men began to debark, some jumping into the shallow
water and wading to the shore. Napoleon, last to land, ordered a bivouac
in an olive plantation between the sea and the road from Antibes to
Cannes. He sent a small group to Cannes to buy horses and provisions,
and to pay in cash; he had brought 800,000 gold francs from Elba. He
bade another group go to Antibes and persuade its garrison to join him;
its commander rebuked and imprisoned the messengers. Napoleon refused to
go and attempt to free them; he was resolved to gain Paris without
firing a shot.</p>
<p>He found no welcome in Antibes. The passersby, on being told that the
little man studying maps at an open-air table was the Emperor, voiced no
enthusiasm. The region had been hard hit by the wars, the conscriptions,
and the double blockade; it had no appetite for more of the same. The
mayor of Antibes came to examine the invaders, and told Napo leon, “We
were beginning to be happy and tranquil; you will trouble everything.”
Napoleon, recalling this at St. Helena, said to Gourgaud, “I shall not
tell you how this remark moved me, nor the pain it gave me.” 16 A
passing courier partly re - assured him: the Army and the commonalty, he
reported, were for him, from Paris to Cannes, but the people of Provence
were against him.</p>
<p>Napoleon knew this well, recalling his bitter experiences at Orgon
eleven months before, and these memories now determined his route to
Paris. Rather than follow, at the risk of bloody encounters, the
well-traveled and mostly level highways from Cannes to Toulon,
Marseilles, and Avignon to Paris, he chose the mountainous route from
Cannes to Grasse, Digne, Grenoble</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>737</p>
<p>and Lyons. The region south of Grenoble was lightly populated, the
gar- risons were small and notoriously anti-Bourbon. The mountain passes
were still covered with snow; the Old Guardsmen and the grenadiers would
grumble, but they would never desert him.</p>
<p>So, about midnight of March 1-2, the eleven hundred set out on the
road to Cannes. Some sixty of them had been able to buy horses, but, to
keep pace and friendship with the rest, they walked beside their
baggage-laden mounts. Napoleon usually rode in a carriage. In the center
of the procession some</p>
<p>guardsmen watched over Napoleon’s gold. Tough Corsicans brought up
the rear. 17</p>
<p>At Grasse they left their cannon as too big a problem for icebound
moun- tain ro ads. Napoleon’s veterans, used to winning wars with their
legs, set a good pace for the rest. On March 5 they reached Gap, having
walked (most of them) 1 50 miles in four days. At La Mure, twenty miles
south of Grenoble, they encountered their first serious challenge.</p>
<p>The commander of the Fifth Division of the Army, stationed at
Grenoble, had received orders from Paris to arrest Napoleon, and had
sent a battalion of five hundred men to stop the approaching rebels. As
the opposed columns neared each other Napoleon ordered his defenders to
ground their arms. He stepped out in front and walked toward the
oncoming troops. Nearing them, he stopped and addressed them: “Soldiers
of the Fifth, I am your Emperor; do you recognize me?” He opened his
military greatcoat, and said, “If there is among you a soldier who would
like to kill his Emperor, here lam [me voila].” Almost to a man the
battalion lowered its arms, and cried out, “Vive rEmpereur /” It
disbanded, and the happy soldiers gathered around Napo- leon, seeking to
touch him. He spoke to them affectionately, returned to his group, and
told them, “Everything is settled; in ten days we shall be in the
Tuileries.” 18</p>
<p>That evening they approached Grenoble. Hundreds of peasants and pro-
letaires flocked to welcome him; and when they found one of the city
gates closed they broke it down to let the little army in. Bidding his
exhausted men find a good rest till the next noon, he himself went to
the Inn of the Trois Dauphins. The mayor, the municipal officers, even
the military com- manders came to greet him. On the next morning he
received a larger dele- gation, which asked him to pledge himself to
constitutional government. He knew that Grenoble had been in the
forefront of the Revolution, and that it had never lost its thirst for
freedom. He addressed them in terms that re- pudiated his past
absolutism and promised reform. He acknowledged that he had assumed
excessive power, and that he had allowed his wars, originally defensive,
to become wars of conquest, nearly exhausting France. He pledged himself
to give France a representative government loyal to the principles of
1789 and 1792. Now, he told them, his dearest hope was to prepare his
son to be the worthy and liberal leader of an enlightened France. 19</p>
<p>That afternoon (March 8) he bade his followers resume their march; he
would remain a day more at Grenoble to issue directives to those towns
that</p>
<p>738</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>were accepting his lead; but he promised to rejoin his band in time
to help them to peaceful victories. On March io he caught up with them,
and led them on to Lyons.</p>
<p>By this time the news of Napoleon’s escapade had reached Louis XVIII.
He was not at first alarmed, feeling confident that the culprit would
soon be stopped. But as the march continued, and approached a Grenoble
known for its hostility to the Bourbons, Louis issued on March 7 a
proclamation exhorting every citizen to help take this troublesome
criminal and bring him to a military court for trial and execution; and
the same punishment was decreed for all who aided him. The King summoned
Ney from retirement, and asked him to lead a force against Napoleon. Ney
agreed, but the story that he vowed to bring Napoleon back in an iron
cage is probably a fable. 20 Ney hurried south, took command of a
battalion at Besangon, and called upon Generals de Bourmont and Lecourbe
to join him with their forces at Lons-le-Saunier (northwest of Geneva).
To the six thousand troops so as- sembled he made a fiery speech to stir
their courage. “It is well,” he said, “that the man from Elba has
attempted his foolish enterprise, for it will be the last act of the
Napole onade.” 21 There was little response from his men.</p>
<p>On that day, March 10, Lyons was acclaiming Napoleon. The manufac-
turers there had generally prospered under the Continental Blockade,
which had opened all Europe except England to Lyons products, and they
had no love for the emigres who had returned to the city and were
behaving as if there had never been a Revolution. In this resentment
their employees agreed, for reasons of their own; many of them were
ardent Jacobins, part of an underground current that now rose to the
surface to welcome Na- poleon in the hope that he would lead them back
to 1789. The peasants of the hinterland trembled for their unblessed
lands, and looked to Napoleon to quiet the priestly campaign for the
restoration of the nationalized and redistributed ecclesiastical
domains. And the soldiers of the garrison were eager to replace the red
cockade on their bayonets.</p>
<p>So Lyons opened its gates, the royalists fled, the bourgeoisie
smiled, the workers and soldiers cheered, as Napoleon led his regiment
into the city. The municipal officials, the judges, even some military
leaders came to offer their allegiance; he replied by promising a
constitutional government and a policy of peace. The entire garrison,
except its noble officers, joined his swelling army when he resumed the
march on Paris. He had now twelve thousand troops to fight for him, but
he still hoped to win without a shot. He wrote to Marie Louise,
promising to be in Paris on March 20, the third anniversary of their
son’s birth, and telling her how happy she would make him if she could
join him in Paris soon. He wrote to Ney a note as cordial as if there
had never been a cloud on their friendship; he invited him to a meeting
at Chalons, and promised to receive him as after the battle of Borodino
— as “Prince of the Moskva.”</p>
<p>On March 14, still at Lons-le-Saunier, Ney called his troops together
and read to them the proclamation that was to cost him his life:
“Soldiers, the cause of the Bourbon is lost forever. The legitimate
dynasty that France has</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>739</p>
<p>adopted is about to reascend the throne. It is the Emperor Napoleon,
our sovereign, who is henceforth to reign over our glorious country.”
The soldiers shook the ground with their repeated cries of “Vive
FEmpereur!</p>
<p>On the evening of the 17th, Louis XVIII, in royal apparel, appeared
be- fore the combined chambers in the Palais-Bourbon, and announced his
de- termination to resist Napoleon. “I have labored,” he said, “for the
happiness of my people. Could I, sixty years old, better end my days
than in dying in its defense?” He ordered the mobilization of all loyal
forces. Some an - swered, but they were chiefly his household troops;
the regular Army was slow to respond, and no able leader appeared to
lead or inspire them. The royalists began to emigrate again.</p>
<p>Mme. de Stael’s salon buzzed with rumors, and she too thought of
flight. On March 19 the Journal des debats published an article by her
intermittent lover Benjamin Constant reaffirming his support for Louis
XVIII and con- stitutional government. That evening he went into
hiding.</p>
<p>Louis himself, always reluctant to move, delayed departure till word
came, on March 19, that Napoleon had reached Fontainebleau, and might be
expected in Paris the next day. At 1 1 p.m. Louis and his family rode
out from the Tuileries and headed for Lille. That city was strongly
royalist, but doubtless the King thought, now and then, of a brother who
had set out on a similar trip in 1791, and had been brought back a
prisoner of the people.</p>
<p>On March 20 some enthusiastic Bonapartists, learning that the
Tuileries was free of the King and his household troops, entered it in a
gay impromptu, and prepared the royal chambers to receive Napoleon. All
that day his swelling army marched toward its goal. Napoleon himself
remained in Fontainebleau till 2 p.m., dictating messages and
instructions, and presumably wandering fondly about the palace that had
seen so much history, including an abdication now to be canceled and
avenged. He reached Paris about 9 p.m., accompanied by Bertrand and
Caulaincourt. They drove almost unnoticed until they reached the
Tuileries. There a crowd of relatives and friends greeted him with wild
ecstasy, lifting him bodily up the stairs. He submitted to one embrace
after another, until he stood before them exhausted and bewildered, but
happy to the point of tears. Hortense came; he re- proached her for
having accepted favors from Alexander; she defended her- self; he
melted, took her in his arms, and said, “I am a good father; you know
it…. And you have been present at poor Josephine’ s death. Amid our many
misfortunes her death pained my heart.” 23</p>
<p>So ended the incredible journey: 720 miles from Cannes to Paris in
twenty days, accomplished by most of his companions on foot; and the vow
kept that no shot should be fired in this reconquest of France. Now for
the task of restoring internal peace and unity, forming a new
government, and pre- paring to face 500,000 troops gathering from
Russia, Prussia, Austria, and</p>
<p>740 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>England to send him back to his little island or a more distant one,
or to a firing squad.</p>
<p>Every end is a beginning; and on this March 20, 1815, Napoleon Bona-
parte began his Hundred Days.</p>
<p>V. REBUILDING</p>
<p>The task of restoring a government, an army, and a national will was
made trebly difficult by the illegality of his position, the unity of
his foreign enemies, and the disunion of his people.</p>
<p>He had again, as in 1799, seized by force — or the threat of force —
a legally established government. True enough, he was taking back by
force an authority which had been taken from him by force of arms; but
he had formally surrendered his power by his abdication, and the Senate
had offered the throne to Louis XVIII, who had accepted it as his legal
right, and had not now relinquished it. In the eyes of the Allies — and
of a considerable portion of the French people — he was a usurper.</p>
<p>His foreign enemies were now more firmly united against him than in
their massive campaigns of 1813-14. The many nations represented at the
Congress of Vienna had been unanimous in branding him an outlaw. Not
only had Russia, Prussia, Austria, and England pledged, each of them, 1
50,000 troops to the new campaign to remove him from the scene; Sweden,
the new Ger- man Confederation, and even little Switzerland had promised
to contribute to the wall of flesh and money that was rising to move
upon him.</p>
<p>He sent them humble offers to negotiate a bloodless settlement; they
made no answer. He appealed to his father-in-law, Emperor Francis II of
Austria, to intercede for him with the other Allies — no answer came. He
wrote to his wife to solicit her aid in softening her father; apparently
the message never reached her. On March 25 the united Allies proclaimed
that they were not making war against France, but would never make peace
with Napoleon Bonaparte, lest he should again lead France — willing or
not — into another war disturbing the foundations of European order.</p>
<p>France was by no means united against the united Allies. Thousands of
royalists remained there to plead the case, and organize the defense, of
the absent King. On March 22 hundreds of them welcomed him into Lille on
his flight from Paris, and they grieved when he moved on to Ghent, where
he would again be protected by British power. In the south of France the
royalists were strong enough to keep control of Bordeaux and Marseilles.
In the west the deeply Catholic Vendee had again risen in arms against
Napoleon, whom they considered an atheistic persecutor of their Pope, a
crypto- Jacobin ally of regicides, 24 and an obstinate protector of
property stolen from the Church. In May, 1815, he sent twenty thousand
troops to quell this passionate insurrection. Often, later, he mourned
that these added troops might have won Waterloo. 25</p>
<p>Against his internal foes he could range some elements of public
support</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>741</p>
<p>not all agreeable to his views and character. Most agreeable was the
Army, which (except in Bordeaux and the Vendee) was devoted to him as
the organizer and rewarder of victory. The lower ranks of the nation —
peasants, proletaires, and city populace — were ready to follow his
lead, but they hoped he could avoid war, and they no longer gave him the
worship that had made him reckless and proud. There were still many
Jacobins in the cities, willing to forget his hostility to them if he
would declare himself loyal to the Revo- lution. He accepted their
support, but would not pledge himself to their war against merchants and
priests.</p>
<p>He admired the middle class as the foundation of that social-moral
order which, since the September Massacres, had become the center of his
political philosophy; but it did not offer him its support or its sons.
It valued freedom of enterprise and trade and the press, but not of the
ballot or of public speech; it feared the radicals, and wished to limit
the franchise to property owners. It had elected the Chamber of
Deputies, and was resolved to protect the rights of that body to check
the power and policies of the king or emperor. And that rising section
of the bourgeoisie — the intelligentsia of journalists, au- thors,
scientists, philosophers — was making it quite clear that it would fight
with all its weapons against any attempt of Napoleon to reestablish
imperial power.</p>
<p>The challenged hero was himself divided, in purpose and will. He
still worked hard, noting everything, giving orders, sometimes dictating
150 letters in a day. 26 But his very alertness weakened him, for it
told him how little he could rely upon his new generals, or the
chambers, or the nation, or even upon himself. The diseases that six
years later would kill him were al- ready weakening him; hemorrhoids
irritated and humiliated him. He could not work as long as in the
halcyon days of Marengo and Austerlitz. He had lost something of his old
clearness of mind and steadiness of purpose, his old buoyant confidence
in victory. He had begun to doubt his “star.” 27</p>
<p>On the very evening of his reaching Paris he chose a new ministry,
for he needed its aid at once. He rejo iced to learn that Lazare Carnot
(the “or - ganizer of victory” during the Revolution) was ready to serve
him against his enemies; he found him — aged sixty-two — too old for
battle, but made him minister of the interior, as one whom all could
trust. Hardly for such a reason he chose, as minister of police, Joseph
Fouche, now fifty-six, suspected and feared by all, managing a private
network of spies, and maintaining secret relations with almost every
faction; probably the hurried ruler gave him his old office to keep him
under scrutiny; and no one questioned Fouche ’s ability. In most of the
complications that followed he kept the clearest vision and the most
flexible morality. “The Emperor in my eyes,” he was to write in his
Memoirs, “was nothing bu t a worn-out actor, whose performance could not
be reenacted.” 28 Even while serving Napoleon he predicted, to - ward
the end of March, “He can’t last longer than three months.” 29</p>
<p>The next step was to organize an army. Louis XVIII had felt no need
for any except for internal order; consequently he had ended
conscription, and</p>
<p>74 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>had reduced his military to 1 60,000 men. Napoleon restored
conscription in June, but these lucky youths were not yet mobilized when
Waterloo ended the war. He called upon the National Guard to prepare
itself for full — in- cluding foreign — service; many refused; 1 50,000
obeyed. Adding these and some volunteers to the existing Army, he could
muster, in June, 300,000 men. He stationed most of them in the northern
departments, and bade them await further orders. Meanwhile he repeated
his exploits of 1813 and 1814 in raising and allocating provisions and
materiel for the new Army. Secretly he imported guns from his favorite
enemy, England. 30 He could not use all his former marshals, for some
had committed themselves to Louis XVIII; but he still had Ney, Davout,
Soult, Grouchy, Vandamme. He</p>
<p>studied maps of roads and terrain, and reports of enemy movements,
and planned every major aspect of the coming campaign. In such planning
he was at his best and happiest.</p>
<p>He was least comfortable in his third task — to win public support
despite his seizure of the government. Nearly all elements except the
royalists de- manded his commitment to a constitution that would protect
freedom of speech and press, and make him responsible to an elected
parliament. This went sorely against his grain, for he had long been
accustomed to absolute rule, and felt that an able and well-intentioned
dictator like himself was better for a country than a parlement of
palaver and a count of noses whether of voters or of deputies.
Nevertheless, in a gesture of conciliation, he sent for Benjamin
Constant (April 6) to draw up a constitution that would appease the
liberals without manacling the monarchy. He knew that Constant had
written violently against him, but he recognized in him a finished
stylist and a flexible mind. Constant came, uncertain of his fate, and
was relieved to find that all that the Emperor asked of him was to
extemporize a constitution that would satisfy both Napoleon and Mme. de
Stael. He labored for a week, daily exposing his product to his
employer. On April 14 he presented the result to the Council of
State.</p>
<p>It proposed a constitutional monarchy in which the hereditary head of
the state would have ample executive powers, but would be responsible to
a Chamber of Peers nominated by the ruler, and a legislative Chamber of
(six hundred) Representatives elected by the people through intermediate
as- semblies. Specific clauses abolished state censorship and guaranteed
freedom of worship and the press. In this quite traditional way the
Emperor and his scribe felt that they had united the charms of
democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy.</p>
<p>After all this had been accepted by Napoleon, he insisted that the
new constitution be presented to the people not as a repudiation of his
past rule but as an “Acte Additionnel” certifying liberties that
(Napoleon argued) had already existed under the Empire. Constant and his
liberal advisers pro- tested and yielded. On April 23 the Acte
Additionnel was submitted to a plebiscite of all registered voters. The
royalists refused to vote; many others abstained. The vote was 1,552,450
for, 4,800 against. Napoleon ordered that on May 26 the people should
assemble on the Champ-de-Mars, in a massive</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>743</p>
<p>and formal ceremony called the Champ de Mai, to celebrate the
adoption of the constitution, the beginning of a new era, and the
blessing and departure of the troops. The assembly, postponed to June i,
showed Napoleon in a royal mood: he came dressed in his robes as
emperor, in his coronation coach drawn by four horses, and preceded by
his brothers as princes of the Empire. The assemblage was not pleased by
this aroma of a dead past. What had happened to the new
constitution?</p>
<p>The nation received it with some skepticism and much indifference;
ap- parently many doubted its sincerity or permanence. Napoleon himself
gave contradictory testimony on this point. According to Las Cases, the
Emperor felt that doubt of his sincerity was unjustified:</p>
<p>I returned from Elba a new man. They could not believe it; they could
not imagine that a man might have sufficient strength of mind to alter
his character, or to bend to the power of circumstances. I had, however,
given proofs of this, and some pledge to the same effect. Who is
ignorant that I am not a man for half measures? I should have been as
sincerely the monarch of the constitution of peace as I had been of
absolute sway and great enterprises. 31</p>
<p>But the usually trustworthy Gourgaud, devoted to Napoleon, quoted him
as saying, “I was wrong in losing precious time about a constitution,
all the more since it was my intention to send them [the deputies]
packing as soon as I had been victorious.” 32</p>
<p>He had planned to convoke the chambers only after the campaign, when
he might come to them with a persuasive victory. But Lafayette, who had
emerged from his rural seclusion, aged fifty-eight, to play a part in
the drama, insisted on having the Chamber of Representatives convene
before Napoleon’s departure to join his troops. Napoleon yielded, and
the Chamber met on June 3. At once it gave some indication of its mood
by electing as its president Comte Jean-Denis Lanjuinais, a fervent
enemy of the Emperor. On June 7 Napoleon, in simple costume, went to the
Palais-Bourbon and addressed the combined chambers in so modest a manner
that all the dele- gates took an oath to the new constitution, and of
fidelity to the Emperor. 33</p>
<p>On June 12, about thre e o’clock in the morning, while Paris slept,
Na - poleon left for the front.</p>

<li>THE LAST CAMPAIGN</li>

<li>June 15,181 5: Belgium</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon’s plan of campaign was based upon his information about the
amount, division, leadership, location, and prospective strategy of the
Allied forces. Their westward movement had been postponed to give the
Russians time to arrive and share in the campaign; but Napoleon’s swift
advance brought the decision before the Russians could reach the
Rhine.</p>
<p>By June 1 a Prussian army of 1 20,000 had assembled near Namur in
Bel- gium, under the seventy-three-year-old Marshal Bliicher. Farther
north,</p>
<p>744</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>around Brussels, the Duke of Wellington (his mission in Portugal and
Spain having been triumphantly completed) had been given command of what
he called an “infamous army” of 93,000 British, Dutch, Belgian, and
German recruits, most of whom knew only one language, and were a problem
for an English commander. Wellington had to supply their lack of
training by his own resolution and experience. A moment’s contemplation
of Lawrence’s</p>
<p>Napoleon had left some of his army to guard Paris and his line of
com- munications. To challenge the 213,000 men led by Bliicher and
Wellington, he had 126,000 in his Armee du Nord. His hope, of course,
was to meet and defeat one of the two armies before they could unite,
and then, after rest and reorganization, to dispose of the other. The
main route between the Allied armies ran from Namur through Sombreffe to
Quatre-Bras (Four Arms), and thence west by a wider road from the
Franco-Belgian frontier at Charleroi north by Waterloo to Brussels.
Napoleon’s first objective was to capture Quatre-Bras and thereby close
the route between the two Allied armies.</p>
<p>He had instructed the three columns of his Army of the North to con-
verge on June 14 at the River Sambre opposite Charleroi. He joined one
of the columns, and ordered all three of them to begin crossing the
river into Belgium about 3 a.m. of June 15. They did, and easily
captured Charleroi from its small Prussian garrison. About the same
time, however, General Louis de Bourmont defected to the Allies, and
revealed Napoleon’s plans to Bliicher’s officers. The alert “Vorwarts”
had guesse d them, and had sent part of his army west to Sombreffe, and
joined it about 4 a.m. on the 1 5th.</p>
<p>Napoleon now divided his army into a right wing under Grouchy, a left
wing under Ney, and a reserve force, stationed near Charleroi under
Drouet d’Erlon, to go to the aid of Grouchy or Ney as need should call.
Grouchy was to advance northeast toward Sombreffe to challenge Bliicher;
Ney was to march north and capture Quatre-Bras and in any case prevent
Wellington from coming to join Bliicher. Napoleon himself, expecting a
major clash with Bliicher, rode with Grouchy.</p>
<p>Ney, heretofore “the bravest of the brave,” followed, on June 15 and
16, a policy of caution that badly disrupted Napoleon’s plans. Moving
north from Charleroi, he drove the Prussians out of Gosselles, and then
halted, fearing to encounter Wellington’s much larger force. He sent a
cavalry de - tachment ahead to check the situation at Quatre-Bras; it
returned with the report that that town was free of enemy troops. He led
3,000 men to take it, thinking that these would suffice; but by the time
he sighted Quatre-Bras it had been occupied by Prince Bernhard of
Saxe-Weimar with 4,000 troops and eight guns; Ney turned back to
Gosselies and awaited further instruc- tions. Bernhard sent a message to
Wellington to bring his main army down to Quatre- Bras, lest Ney’s main
force should soon besiege it.</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. on June 15, Wellington, at Brussels, received news that
Na-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>745</p>
<p>poleon’s army had crossed into Belgium. Believing that Napoleon would
follow his custom of making an end run for a flank attack, he held his
forces in readiness near the Belgian capital. That evening he and many
of his officers — “brave men” with a fondness for “fair women”— attended
a ball given by the Duchess of Richmond. 34 There, about midnight, he
received a message that Quatre-Bras was in danger. He quietly gave
orders to his officers to prepare to march early that morning. He
himself, not to disturb the elegant affair, stayed and danced till 3
a.m. 3S</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>June 16: Ligny</li>
</ol>
<p>About 2 p.m. of June 16 Marshal Soult, Napoleon’s chief of staff,
sent final orders to Ney:</p>
<p>The Emperor charges me to notify you that the enemy has assembled a
body of troops between Sombreffe and Brye, and that at 2:30 p.m. Marshal
Grouchy, with the Third and Fourth Corps, will attack him. The intention
of his Majesty is that you should attack whatever [enemy] is before you,
and that after having vigorously pressed them back you should turn
toward us and join us in surrounding the enemy. 36</p>
<p>Bliicher brought up all his 83,000 men to resist the French. The
battle began about 3 p.m. near the town of Ligny, with simultaneous
attacks by Grouchy’s right under Vandamme, his center under Gerard, and
his left — the cavalry — under Grouchy himself, with Napoleon directing
the triple operation of 78,000 men. It soon became evident that the
redoubtable Bliicher was not to be easily disposed of; and if the French
should be defeated here their entire campaign would collapse. At 3:15
Napoleon sent an appeal to Ney: “The Prussian army is lost if you will
act vigorously. The fate of</p>
<p>But Ney too was in difficulties. By 3 p.m. Wellington had brought
down most of ms army to Quatre-Bras. Not knowing this (for
communications had fallen apart in Souk’s hands), Napoleon sent orders
to Drouet d’Erlon at Charleroi to hurry north with his reserve force and
attack Bliicher’s right flank. Drouet had advanced almost to Ligny when
a courier brought him an urgent command from Ney to rush to his support
against Wellington’s su - perior numbers at Quatre- Bras. Drouet thought
Ney’s need the more urgent, and marched his corps to Quatre-Bras, only
to find that Ney, after desperate efforts and having two horses killed
under him, had given up the attempt to dislodge Wellington.</p>
<p>At Ligny the battle raged through six hours of slaughter, in which no
quarter was given by either side; a Prussian officer later recalled that
“the men massacred one another as if they had been animated with a
personal hatred.” 38 Once quiet villages like St. -Amand and La Haye
passed from side to side in desperate man-to-man combat. Ligny itself
went up in flames. As night and rain fell Napoleon ordered his Old Guard
to attack the Prussian</p>
<p>74*5 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>center. The rain became a thunderstorm; the Prussian center gave way;
Bliicher, still resisting, fell from his horse, and had to be carried
away. The French were too exhausted to turn the defeat into a rout. The
Prussians re- treated north toward Wavre, leaving twelve thousand dead
or wounded be- hind them. Napoleon himself had used almost the last
resources of his nervous strength. If Wellington had been able to come
up at that moment from Quatre-Bras there might have been no
Waterloo.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>June 17: Rain</li>
</ol>
<p>It was just as well for Napoleon that the downpour made a major
battle impossible on the 17th. The ground was mud; how could artillery
be drawn or stationed in that sodden and fluctuating earth? Those
adjectives might have been applied to the imperial mind when, at 7 a.m.,
a message from Ney told Napoleon that Wellington was holding
Quatre-Bras, and implying that only the full French army could dislodge
him. Napoleon’s answer— or its obscure phrasing — must have left Ney
more bewildered than ever: “Take up your position at Quatre-Bras…. But
if this is impossible… send information immediately, and the Emperor
will act then. If… there is only a rear guard, attack it and seize the
position.” 39 There was more than a rear guard, and Ney refused to renew
the attack. Wellington, having heard of Bliicher’s defeat, withdrew his
army north to a defen sible plateau called Mont St. -Jean, and retired
to his headquarters at nearby Waterloo.</p>
<p>Napoleon directed Grouchy, with 30,000 men, to pursue the Prussians
throughout June 17, and in any case prevent them from joining
Wellington. He himself, with 40,000 survivors from the battle of Ligny,
marched to join Ney at Quatre-Bras. When he arrived, about 2 p.m., he
was disheartened to learn that Wellington was not there. “On a perdu la
France /” he cried; “we have lost France!” 40 He ordered pursuit, and h
imself led it, with Ney and Drouet d’Erlon; but a heavy shower decided
him to end the pursuit. At 9 p.m., wet to the skin, he rode back a mile
or two to sleep in bed at Caillou; and his exhausted army — the rain
having ceased — bivouacked upon the wet ground for the night.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Sunday, June 18: Waterloo</li>
</ol>
<p>At 2 a.m. Bliicher sent a message to Wellington promising him that a
Prussian corps under General Friedrich Wilhelm von Billow would leave
Wavre at daybreak to join him against the French, and that two other
Prus- sian corps would follow soon thereafter. At 10 a.m. Napoleon, not
knowing of these courtesies, sent instructions to Grouchy to continue
pursuing Bliicher to Wavre.</p>
<p>He had planned to begin action at 9 a.m., but his artillery captains
per- suaded him to delay until the soil had begun to dry. Meanwhile
Wellington had stationed his forces on raised land south of Mont
St. -Jean. He had 70,000 men and 184 guns; Napoleon had 74,000 men and
266 guns. Each leader had</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>TO WATERLOO</p>
<p>747</p>
<p>generals who had earned — or would here earn — a place in history:
Prince Friedrich of Brunswick (son of the Duke who had lost at Valmy and
had been mortally wounded at Auerstedt), Dornberg, Alten, Kempt,
Somerset, Uxbridge, Hill, Ponsonby, Picton, all under a Wellington as
tough as his language and as proud as a duke. Add Biilow, Zieten, and
Pirch under Bliicher; and, for the French, Ney, Grouchy, Vandamme,
Gerard, Cam- bronne, Kellermann, Reille, Lobau, and Napoleon.</p>
<p>He had begun to pay for crowding years into every month, eating and
mating hastily, living at high tension on throne and battlefield, and,
lately, solacing his sorrows with food. Six years later the post-mortem
examination of his organs would show half a dozen ailments and
abnormalities. Now, at Waterloo, he had to spend hours on horseback
while suffering from hemor- rhoids; 41 he had stones in the bladder, and
his dysuria required frequent and often untimely urination; and perhaps
the cancer that killed him and his father was already consuming him. 42
These disorders wore him down in vigor, courage, patience, and
confidence. “I no longer had in me the senti - ment of final success…. I
felt fortune abandon me.” 43 Nevertheless, pre - sumab ly to give them
confidence, he assured his worried generals, “If my orders are well
executed we shall sleep tonight in Brussels.” 44</p>
<p>His generals saw the situation more clearly. Soult advised him to bid
Grouchy bring his 30,000 men west, as soon as possible, and join in the
at- tack; instead Napoleon allowed them to spend time and themselves in
chasing Bliicher north to Wavre; presumably he hoped that if the
Prussians turned west to help Wellington, Grouchy would attack their
rear. Wellington made, according to aftersight, an equally serious error
in leaving 17,000 of his men near Brussels to guard against a French
flank attack upon his vital approaches to the sea.</p>
<p>At 1 1 a.m. Napoleon ordered his army to begin the attack — upon the
enemy center, which was manned by tough Scots and Englishmen. Ney led
with all his old dash and bravery, but the British held firm. From
behind one hill after another hidden artillery spread death wholesale
among the startled French. About 1 p.m., from his observation post
considerably southwest of the action, Napoleon saw, far east, a cloud of
troops moving toward the battle; a German prisoner told him that these
were the van of Billow’s Prus - sian corps, marching to help Wellington.
Napoleon sent a battalion under General Lobau to intercept the
Prussians, and dispatched a message to Grouchy to attack Biilow and then
come to help the main French army against Wellington. About 11:30 a.m.
Grouchy, marching north between Gembloux and Wavre, heard the noise of
cannon fire in the west. General Gerard urged him to abandon pursuit of
Bliicher, and strike cross-country to add his 30,000 men to Napoleon’s.
Grouchy caught up with part of Bliicher’s forces, defeated it, entered
Wavre, found Bliicher gone, and rested.</p>
<p>By that time, 4 p.m., the battle of Waterloo was at its height: a
vast melee of men killing or being killed, gaining or losing a strategic
post, facing on- rushing horses, dodging a dozen swords, falling and
dying in the mud. Thou- sands deserted on either side; Wellington spent
part of his time riding behind</p>
<p>748</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>he lines and frightening deserters back to their posts. Ney led
charge after charge; four horses were killed under him. Toward 6 p.m. he
received an order from Napoleon to seize La Haye Sainte — the Holy
Hedgerow. He suc- ceeded, and thought he had found an opening to
Wellington’s last line. He sent an appeal to Napoleon for additional
infantry, and pushed ahead. Napo- leon fumed at his reckless advance,
for which no adequate support could be sent without weakening the
general plan; but, feeling that “the wretch”</p>
<p>But it was the Prussians who were coming. Biilow had broken Lobau’s
re - sistance, and was rapidly nearing the main action; and two more
Prussian corps were approaching. Napoleon saw that his last chance was
to crush the English before the Prussians could intervene. He called
upon his Old Guard to follow him to the decisive attack. A French
deserter found his way to Wellington and warned him, “The Guards will be
on you in half an hour.” About this time a British marksman sighted
Napoleon. “There’s Bonaparte,</p>
<p>Then, when the French thought they were victorious, the cry came to
Napoleon, the Guards, and Ney that the Prussians, 30,000 of them, 49
were attacking the French, and were spreading terror and disorder. When
Ney charged again, the British line held fast, and Ney fell back.
Wellington saw his chance. Riding the top of the slope to be more
visible, he waved his hat in the air as the signal agreed upon for a
general advance; drums and bugles carried the message; 40,000
Englishmen, Scots, Belgians, and Germans — right, center, and left —
changed from defense to offense, and swept forward, careless of life.
The morale of the French faltered and collapsed, and they fled; even the
Old Guard began to turn their horses back. Napoleon shouted orders to
stop; they were not heard in the tumult; and the smoke of battle helped
the growing dusk to make him indistinguishable in the mass. Yielding to
this sudden plebiscite, he commanded a retreat in the forms prescribed
by the manual of order, but the French, attacked in front and flank by
over- whelmingly superior numbers, had no time for disciplined
formations; “ Sauve qui pent! Let each save himself who can!” became the
motto, spoken or not, of the shattered army, no longer soldiers but men.
Amid the rout Marshal Ney, the faint of flesh and heart at Quatre-Bras,
the hero of heroes at Waterloo, stood horseless and bewildered, his face
blackened with pow- der, his uniform in rags, a broken sword in the hand
that had almost grasped</p>

<p>victory. 50 Then he too — and Napoleon — joined the 40,000 men
rushing down roads and fields to Genappe, to Quatre-Bras, to Charleroi,
and then, by whatever means, over the River Sambre to France.</p>
<p>They left behind them 25,000 dead or wounded, and 8,000 prisoners.
Wellington had lost 15,000, Bliicher 7,000. The two victors met on the
road near La Belle Alliance, and exchanged kisses. Wellington left the
pur- suit to the enthusiastic Prussians, and Bliicher, too old for the
chase, turned it over to Gneisenau at Genappe, and there he sent a
message to his wife: “In concert with my friend Wellington, I have
exterminated the army of Napoleon.” But also he wrote to his friend
Knesebeck: “I tremble in all my members. The effort has been too great.”
51 Wellington put the matter to Lord Uxbridge in his hearty way: “We
have given Napoleon the coup de grace. There is nothing left for him but
to hang him self.” 52</p>
<p>In the retreat Napoleon joined one of the more orderly regiments,
dis- mounted, and walked with the others. He wept for his lost army, 53
and mourned that he had not died.</p>
