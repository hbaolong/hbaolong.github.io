<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>The Islamic Scene</p>
<p>628-1058</p>
<p>I. THE ECONOMY</p>
<p>C IVILIZATION is a union of soil and soul — the resources of the
earth transformed by the desire and discipline of men. Behind the
fagade, and under the burden, of courts and palaces, temples and
schools, letters and luxuries and arts, stands the basic man: the hunter
bringing game from the woods; the woodman felling the forest; the
herdsman pasturing and breed- ing his flock; the peasant clearing,
plowing, sowing, cultivating, reaping, tending the orchard, the vine,
the hive, and the brood; the woman absorbed in the hundred crafts and
cares of a functioning home; the miner digging in the earth; the builder
shaping homes and vehicles and ships; the artisan fash- ioning products
and tools; the pedlar, shopkeeper, and merchant uniting and dividing
maker and user; the investor fertilizing industry with his savings; the
executive harnessing muscle, materials, and minds for the creation of
services and goods. These are the patient yet restless leviathan on
whose swaying back civilization precariously rides.</p>
<p>All these were busy in Islam. Men raised cattle, horses, camels,
goats, ele- phants, and dogs; stole the honey of bees and the milk of
camels, goats, and cows; and grew a hundred varieties of grains,
vegetables, fruits, nuts, and flowers. The orange tree was brought from
India to Arabia at some time be- fore the tenth century; the Arabs
introduced it to Syria, Asia Minor, Pales- tine, Egypt, and Spain, from
which countries it pervaded southern Europe . 1 The cultivation of sugar
cane and the refining of sugar were likewise spread by the Arabs from
India through the Near East, and were brought by Cru- saders to their
European states . 2 Cotton was first cultivated in Europe by the Arabs .
8 These achievements on lands largely arid were made possible by or-
ganized irrigation; here the caliphs made an exception to their
principle of leaving the economy to free enterprise; the government
directed and fi- nanced the maintenance of the greater canals. The
Euphrates was channeled into Mesopotamia, the Tigris into Persia, and a
great canal connected the twin rivers at Baghdad. The early Abbasid
caliphs encouraged the draining of marshes, and the rehabilitation of
ruined villages and deserted farms. In the tenth century, under the
Samanid princes, the region between Bokhara and Samarkand was considered
one of the “four earthly paradises”— the</p>

<p>THE ISLAMIC SCENE</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>others being southern Persia, southern Iraq, and the region around
Damascus.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, iron, lead, mercury, antimony, sulphur, asbestos,
marble, and precious stones were mined or quarried from the earth.
Divers fished for pearls in the Persian Gulf. Some use was made of
naphtha and bitumen; an entry in Harun’s archives gives the price of
“naphtha and reeds” used in burn- ing the corpse of Jafar. 4 Industry
was in the handicraft stage, practiced in homes and artisans’ shops, and
organized in guilds. We find few factories, and no clear advance in
technology except the development of the windmill. Ma- sudi, writing in
the tenth century, speaks of seeing these in Persia and the Near East;
there is no sign of them in Europe before the twelfth century; possibly
they were another gift of the Moslem East to its crusading foes. 6 There
was much mechanical ingenuity. The water clock sent by Harun al-Rashid
to Charlemagne was made of leather and damascened brass; it told the
time by metal cavaliers who at each hour opened the door, let fall the
proper number of balls on a cymbal, and then, retiring, closed the door.
0 Production was slow, but the worker could express himself in integral
work, and made almost every industry an art. Persian, Syrian, and
Egyptian textiles were famous for the patient perfection of their
technique; Mosul for its cotton muslin, Da- mascus for its damask linen,
Aden for its wool. Damascus was noted also for its swords of highly
tempered steel; Sidon and Tyre for glass of unexcelled thinness and
clarity; Baghdad for its glass and pottery; Rayy for pottery, needles,
combs; Raqqa for olive oil and soap; Fars for perfume and rugs. Under
Moslem rule western Asia attained a pitch of industrial and commer- cial
prosperity unmatched by western Europe before the sixteenth century.
7</p>
<p>Land transport was chiefly by camels, horses, mules, and men. But the
horse was too prized to be chiefly a beast of burden. “Do not call him
my horse,” said an Arab; “call him my son. He runs more swiftly than the
tem - pest, quicker than a glance He is so light of foot that he could
dance on the</p>
<p>breast of you r mistress and she would take no hurt.” 8 So the camel,
“ship of the desert,” bore most of the freight of Arab trade; and
caravans of 4700 camels swayed across the Moslem world. Great roads
radiating from Bagh- dad led through Rayy, Nishapur, Merv, Bokhara, and
Samarkand to Kashgar and the Chinese frontier; through Basra to Shiraz;
through Kufa to Medina, Mecca, and Aden; through Mosul or Damascus to
the Syrian coast. Cara- vanserais or inns, hospices and cisterns helped
the traveler and his beasts. Much inland traffic was borne on rivers and
canals. Harun al-Rashid planned a Suez canal, but Yahya, for unknown
reasons, probably financial, discour- aged the idea. 9 The Tigris at
Baghdad, 750 feet wide, was spanned by three bridges built upon
boats.</p>
<p>Over these arteries a busy commerce passed. It was an economic
advantage to western Asia that one government united a region formerly
divided among four states; customs dues and other trade barriers were
removed, and the flow of commodities was further eased by unity of
language and faith.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>The Arabs did not share the European aristocrat’s scorn of the
merchant; soon they joined Christians, Jews, and Persians in the
business of getting goods from producer to consumer with the least
possible profit to either. Cities and towns swelled and hummed with
transport, barter, and sale; ped- lars cried their wares to latticed
windows; shops dangled their stock and re- sounded with haggling; fairs,
markets, and bazaars gathered merchandise, merchants, buyers, and poets;
caravans bound China and India to Persia, Syria, and Egypt; and ports
like Baghdad, Basra, Aden, Cairo, and Alexandria sent Arab merchantmen
out to sea. Moslem commerce dominated the Medi- terranean till the
Crusades, plying between Syria and Egypt at one end, Tunis, Sicily,
Morocco, and Spain at the other, and touching Greece, Italy, and Gaul;
it captured control of the Red Sea from Ethiopia; it reached over the
Caspian into Mongolia, and up the Volga from Astrakhan to Novgorod,
Finland, Scandinavia, and Germany, where it left thousands of Moslem
coins; it answered the Chinese junks that visited Basra by sending Arab
dhows out from the Persian Gulf to India and Ceylon, through the Straits
and up the Chinese coast to Khanfu (Canton) ; a colony of Moslem and
Jew- ish merchants was well established there in the eighth century. 10
This vital- izing commercial activity reached its peak in the tenth
century, when west- ern Europe was at nadir; and when it subsided it
left its mark upon many European languages in such words as tariff,
traffic , magazine , caravan , and bazaar.</p>
<p>The state left industry and commerce free, and aided it with a
relatively stable currency. The early caliphs used Byzantine and Persian
money, but in 695 Abd-al-Malik struck an Arab coinage of gold dinars and
silver dirhems.* Ibn Hawqal ( c . 975) describes a kind of promissory
note for 42,000 dinars addressed to a merchant in Morocco; from the
Arabic word sakk for this form of credit is derived our word check.
Investors shared in financing com- mercial voyages or caravans; and
though interest was forbidden, ways were found, as in Europe, of evading
the prohibition and repaying capital for its use and risk. Monopolies
were illegal, but prospered. Within a century after Omar’s death the
Arab upper classes had amassed great wealth, and lived on luxurious
estates manned by hundreds of slaves. 11 Yahya the Barma- kid offered
7,000,000 dirhems (60,000) for a pearl box made of precious stones, and
was refused; the Caliph Muqtafi, if we may believe Moslem fig- ures,
left at his death 20,000,000 dinars (4,500,000) in jewelry and per-
fumes. 12 When Harun al-Rashid married his son al-Mamun to Buran, her
grandmother emptied a shower of pearls upon the groom; and her father
scattered among the guests balls of musk, each of which contained a writ
en- # The dinar (from the Roman denarius ) contained 65 grams of gold,
or .135 of an ounce, and would be equal to .7214 in terms of the price
of gold in the United States of America in 1947; we shall roughly reckon
it at .75. The dirhem (from the Greek drachma ) contained forty-three
grams of silver, worth some eight cents. As the purity of the coinage
varied, our equivalents will be only approximate.</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) THE ISLAMIC SCENE 209</p>
<p>titling the possessor to a slave, a horse, an estate, or some other
gift. 13 After Muqtadir confiscated 1 6,000,000 dinars of Ibn al-
Jassas’ fortune, that famous jeweler remained a wealthy man. Many
overseas traders were worth 4,000,- 000 dinars; hundreds of merchants
had homes costing from 10,000 to 30,000 dinars (42, 500). 14</p>
<p>At the bottom of the economic structure were the slaves. They were
prob- ably more numerous in Islam in proportion to population than in
Christen- dom, where serfdom was replacing slavery. The Caliph Muqtadir,
we are told, had 11,000 eunuchs in his household; Musa took 300,000
captives in Africa, 30,000 “virgins” in Spain, and sold them into
slavery; Qutayba cap- tured 100,000 in Sogdiana; the figures are
Oriental and must be discounted. The Koran recognized the capture of
non-Moslems in war, and the birth of children to slave parents, as the
sole legitimate sources of slavery; no Moslem (just as in Christendom no
Christian) was to be enslaved. Nevertheless a brisk trade developed in
slaves captured in raids — Negroes from East and Central Africa, Turks
or Chinese from Turkestan, whites from Russia, Italy, and Spain. The
Moslem had full rights of life and death over his slaves; usu- ally,
however, he handled them with a genial humanity that made their lot no
worse — perhaps better, as more secure — than that of a factory worker
in nineteenth-century Europe. 15 Slaves did most of the menial work on
the farms, most of the unskilled manual work in the towns; they acted as
servants in the household, and as concubines or eunuchs in the harem.
Most dancers, singers, and actors were slaves. The offspring of a female
slave by her mas- ter, or of a free woman by her slave, was free from
birth. Slaves were allowed to marry; and their children, if talented,
might receive an education. It is as- tonishing how many sons of slaves
rose to high place in the intellectual and political world of Islam, how
many, like Mahmud and the early Mameluks, became kings.</p>
<p>Exploitation in Asiatic Islam never reached the mercilessness of
pagan, Christian, or Moslem Egypt, where the peasant toiled every hour,
earned enough to pay for a hut, a loincloth, and food this side of
starvation. There was and is much begging in Islam, and much imposture
in begging; but the poor Asiatic had a protective skill in working
slowly, few men could rival him in manifold adaptation to idleness, alms
were frequent, and at the worst a homeless man could sleep in the finest
edifice in town — the mosque. Even so, the eternal class war simmered
sullenly through the years, and broke out now and then (778, 796, 808,
838) in violent revolt. Usually, since state and church were one,
rebellion took a religious garb. Some sects, like the Khur- ramiyya and
the Muhayyida, adopted the communistic ideas of the Persian rebel
Mazdak; one group called itself Surkh Alam — the “Red Flag.” 16 About
772 Hashim al-Muqanna — the “Veiled Prophet” of Khuras an — announced
that he was God incarnate, and had come to restore the communism of Maz-
dak. He gathered various sects about him, defeated many armies,
ruled</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>northern Persia for fourteen years, and was finally (786) captured
and killed. 17 In 838 Babik al-Khurrani renewed the effort, gathered
around him a band known as Muhammira — i.e. “Reds” 18 — seized
Azerbaijan, held it for twenty-two years, defeated a succession of
armies, and (Tabari would have us believe) killed 255,500 soldiers and
captives before he was overcome. The Caliph Mutasim ordered Babik’s own
executioner to cut off Babik’s limbs one by one; the trunk was impaled
before the royal palace; and the head was sent on exhibition around the
cities of Khurasan 19 as a reminder that all men are born unfree and
unequal.</p>
<p>The most famous of these “servile wars” of the East was organized by
Ali, an Arab who claimed descent from the Prophet’s son -in-law. Near
Basra many Negro slaves were employed in digging saltpeter. Ali
represented to them how badly they were treated, urged them to follow
him in revolt, and promised them freedom, wealth — and slaves. They
agreed, seized food and supplies, defeated the troops sent against them,
and built themselves inde- pendent villages with palaces for their
leaders, prisons for their captives, and mosques for their prayers
(869). The employers offered Ali five dinars (3.75) per head if he would
persuade the rebels to return to work; he re- fused. The surrounding
country tried to starve them into submission; but when their supplies
ran out they attacked the town of Obolla, freed and ab- sorbed its
slaves, sacked it, and put it to flames (870) . Much encouraged, Ali led
his men against other towns, took many of them, and captured control of
southern Iran and Iraq to the gates of Baghdad. Commerce halted, and the
capital began to starve. In 871 the Negro general Mohallabi, with a
large army of rebels, seized Basra; if we may credit the historians,
300,000 persons were massacred, and thousands of white women and
children, including the Hashimite aristocracy, became the concubines or
slaves of the Negro troops. For ten years the rebellion continued; great
armies were sent to suppress it; amnesty and rewards were offered to
deserters; many of his men left Ali and joined the government’s forces.
The remnant was surrounded, besieged, and bombarded with molten lead and
“Greek fire”— flaming torches of naphtha. Finally, a government army
under the vizier Mowaffaq made its way into the rebel city, overcame
resistance, killed Ali, and brought his head to the victor. Mowaffaq and
his officers knelt and thanked Allah for His mercies (88 3). 20 The
rebellion had lasted fourteen years, and had threatened the whole
economic and political structure of Eastern Islam. Ibn Tulun, gov- ernor
of Egypt, took advantage of the situation to make the richest of the
caliph’s provinces an independent state.</p>

<p>Next to bread and woman, in the hierarchy of desire, comes eternal

<p>THE ISLAMIC SCENE</p>

<p>for God. Despite polygamy, the Moslem found considerable time for
Allah, and based his morals, his laws, and his government upon his
religion.</p>
<p>Theoretically the Moslem faith was the simplest of all creeds: “There
is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is His Prophet.” (La ilaha il
-Allah,</p>
<p>Muhammad-un Rasulu-llah.) The simplicity of the formula is only
apparent, for its second clause involves the acceptance of the Koran and
all its teach- ings. Consequently the orthodox Moslem also believed in
heaven and hell, angels and demons, the resurrection of body and soul,
the divine predestina- tion of all events, the Last Judgment, the four
duties of Moslem practice- prayer, alms, fasting, and pilgrimage — and
the divine inspiration of various prophets who led up to Mohammed. “For
every nation,” said the Koran, “there is a messenger and prophet” (x,
48) ; some Mosle ms reckon such mes- sengers at 2 24,000; 21 but
apparently only Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were considered by Mohammed as
having spoken the word of God. Hence the Moslem was required to accept
the Old Testament and the Gospels as in- spired scriptures; where these
contradicted the Koran it was because their divine text had been
willfully or unwittingly corrupted by men; in any case the Koran
superseded all previous revelations, and Mohammed excelled all the other
messengers of God. Moslems proclaimed his mere humanity, but revered him
almost as intensely as Christians worshiped Christ. “If I had been alive
in his time,” said a typical Moslem, “I would not have allowed the
Apostle of God to put his blessed foot upon the earth, but would have
borne h im upon my shoulders wherever he wished to go.” 22</p>
<p>Making their faith still more complex, good Moslems accepted and</p>
<p>obeyed, besides the Koran, the ’traditions (Hadith) preserved by
their learned men of their Prophet’s customs (Sunna) and conversation.
Time brought forward questions of creed, ritual, morals, and law to
which the holy book gave no clear answer; sometimes the words of the
Koran were ob- scure, and needed elucidation; it was useful to know
what, on such points, the Prophet or his Companions had done or said.
Certain Moslems devoted themselves to gathering such traditions. During
the first century of their era they refrained from writing them down;
they formed schools of Hadith in divers cities, and gave public
discourses reciting them; it was not unusual for Moslems to travel from
Spain to Persia to hear a Hadith from one who claimed to have it in
direct succession from Mohammed. In this way a body of oral teaching
grew up alongside the Koran, as the Mishna and Gemara grew up beside the
Old Testament. And as Jehuda ha-Nasi gathered the oral law of the Jews
into written form in 189, so in 870, al-Bukhari, after re- searches
which led him from Egypt to Turkestan, critically examined 600,- 000
Mohammedan traditions, and published 7 2 7 5 of them in his Sahib — “Cor
- rect Book.” Each chosen tradition was traced through a long chain
(isnad) of named transmitters to one of the Companions, or to the
Prophet himself.</p>
<p>Many of the traditions put a new color upon the Moslem creed.
Moham-</p>
<p>212 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>med had not claimed the power of miracles, but hundreds of pretty
tradi- tions told of his wonder-working; how he fed a multitude from
food hardly adequate for one man; exorcised demons; drew rain from
heaven by one prayer, and stopped it by another; how he touched the
udders of dry goats and they gave milk; how the sick were healed by
contact with his clothes or his shorn hair. Christian influences seem to
have molded many of the tradi- tions; love toward one’s en emies was
inculcated, though Mohammed had sterner views; the Lord’s Prayer was
adopted from the Gospels; the parables of the sower, the wedding guests,
and the laborers in the vineyard were put into Mohammed’s mouth; 23 all
in all, he was transformed in to an excellent Christian, despite his
nine wives. Moslem critics complained that much of the Hadith had been
concocted as Umayyad, Abbasid, or other propa- ganda; 24 Ibn Abi
al-Awja, executed at Kufa in 772, confessed to having fab- ricated 4000
traditions. 25 A few skeptics laughed at the Hadith collections, and
composed indecent stories in solemn Hadith form. 20 Nevertheless the
acceptance of the Hadith, in one or the other of the approved
collections, as binding in faith and morals, became a distinguishing
mark of orthodox Mos- lems, who therefore received the name of Sunni, or
traditionalists.</p>
<p>One tradition represented the angel Gabriel as asking Mohammed, “What
is Islam? ’’—and made Mohammed reply: “Islam is to believe in Allah and
His Prophet, to recite the prescribed prayers, to give alms, to observe
the fast of Ramadan, and to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.” 27 Prayer,
almsgiving, fast - ing, and pilgrimage constitute the “Four Duties” of
Moslem religion. These, with belief in Allah and Mohammed, are the “Five
Pillars of Islam.”</p>
<p>Prayer had to be preceded by purification; and as prayer was required
of the Moslem five times a day, cleanliness came literally next to
godliness. Mo- hammed, like Moses, used religion as a means to hygiene
as well as to mo- rality, on the general principle that the rational can
secure popular accept- ance only in the form of the mystical. He warned
that the prayer of an unclean person would not be heard by God; he even
thought of making the brushing of the teeth a prerequisite to prayer;
but finally he compromised on the washing of the face, the hands, and
the feet (v, 6). A man who had had sexual relations, a woman who had
menstruated, or given birth, since the last purification, must bathe
before prayer. At dawn, shortly after midday, in late afternoon, at
sunset, and at bedtime the muezzin mounted a minaret to sound the adhan,
or call to prayer:</p>
<p>Allahu Akbar (God is most great) ! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!</p>
<p>Allahu Akbar! I bear witness that there is no God but Allah. I
bear</p>
<p>witness that there is no God but Allah. I bear witness that there is
no God but Allah. I bear witness that Mohammed is the Apostle of
Allah.</p>

<p>It is a powerful appeal, a noble summons to rise with the sun, a
welcome in- terruption in the hot work of the day, a solemn message of
divine majesty in the stillness of the night; grateful even to alien
ears is this strange shrill chant of many muezzins from divers mosques
calling the earthbound soul to a moment’s communion with the mysterious
source of life and mind. On those five occasions all Moslems everywhere
must leave off whatever else they may be doing, must cleanse themselves,
turn toward Mecca and the Kaaba and recite the same brief prayers, in
the same successive postures, in an impressive simultaneity moving with
the sun across the earth.</p>
<p>Those who had the time and will would go to the mosque to say their
prayers. Usually the mosque was open all day; any Moslem, orthodox or
heretic, might enter to make his ablutions, to rest, or to pray. There,
too, in the cloistered shade, teachers taught their pupils, judges tried
cases, caliphs announced their policies or decrees; people gathered to
chat, hear the news, even to negotiate business; the mosque, like the
synagogue and the church, was the center of daily life, the home and
hearth of the community. Half an hour before Friday noon the muezzin
chanted from the minarets the saluta- tion or salaam — a blessing on
Allah, Mohammed, his family, and the great Companions; and called the
congregation to the mosque. The worshipers were expected to have bathed
and put on clean clothes, and to have perfumed themselves; or they might
perform minor ablutions in the tank or fountain that stood in the
courtyard of the mosque. The women usually stayed at home when the men
went to the mosque, and vice versa; it was feared that the presence of
women, even veiled, would distract the excitable male. The worshipers
removed their shoes at the door of the mosque proper, and en- tered in
slippers or stocking feet. There or in the court (if they were nu-
merous) they stood shoulder to shoulder in one or more rows, facing the
mihrab or prayer niche in the wall, which indicated the qibla or
direction of Mecca. An imam or prayer leader read a passage from the
Koran and preached a short sermon. Each worshiper recited several
prayers, and in the prescribed postures of bowing, kneeling, and
prostration; mosque meant a place of prostration in prayer.* Then the
imam recited a complex series of salutations, benedictions, and orisons,
in which the congregation silently joined. There were no hymns,
processions, or sacraments; no collections or pew rents; religion, being
one with the state, was financed from public funds. The imam was not a
priest but a layman, who continued to earn his living by a secular
occupation, and was appointed by the mosque warden for a speci- fied
period, and a small salary, to lead the congregation in prayer; there

<p>214 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>no priesthood in Islam. After the Friday prayers the Moslems were
free, if they wished, to engage in work as on any other day; meanwhile,
however, they had known a cleansing hour of elevation above economic and
social strife, and had unconsciously cemented their community by common
ritual.</p>
<p>The second duty of Moslem practice was the giving of alms. Mohammed
was almost as critical of the rich as Jesus had been; some have thought
that he began as a social reformer revolted by the contrast between the
luxury of the merchant nobles and the poverty of the masses; 28 and
apparently his early followers were mostly of humble origin. One of his
first activities in Medina was to establish an annual tax of two and a
half per cent on the movable wealth of all citizens for the relief of
the poor. Regular officials collected and distributed this revenue. Part
of the proceeds was used to build mosques and defray the expenses of
government and war; but war in return brought booty that swelled the
gifts to the poor. “Prayer,” said Omar II, “carries us halfway to God,
fasting brings us to the door of His palace, almsgiving lets us in.” 29
The traditions abound in stories of generous Moslems; Hasan, for
example, was said to have three times in his life divided his substance
with the poor, and twice given away all that he had.</p>
<p>The third duty was fasting. In general the Moslem was commanded to
avoid wine, carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine or dogs. But Mohammed
was more lenient than Moses; forbidden foods might be eaten in cases of
ne- cessity; of a tasty cheese containing some prohibited meat he only
asked, with his sly humor, “Mention the name of Allah over it.” 30 He
frowned on asceticism, and condemned monasticism (vii, 27); Mohammedans
were to enjoy the pleasures of life with a good conscience, but in
moderation. Never- theless, Islam, like most religions, required certain
fasts, partly as a discipline of the will, partly, we may presume, as
hygiene. A few months after settling in Medina he saw the Jews keeping
their annual fast of Yom Kippur; he adopted it for his followers, hoping
to win the Jews to Islam; when this hope faded he transferred the fast
to the month of Ramadan. For twenty-nine days the Moslem was to abstain,
during the daylight hours, from eating, drinking, smoking, or contact
with the other sex; exceptions were made for the sick, the weary
traveler, the very young or old, and women with child or giving suck.
When first decreed, the month of fasting fell in winter, when daylight
came late and ended soon. But as the lunar calendar of the Moslems made
the year shorter than the four seasons, Ramadan, every thirty-three
years, fell in midsummer, when the days are long and the Eastern heat
makes thirst a torture; yet the good Moslem bore the fast. Each night,
however, the fast was broken, and the Moslem might eat, drink, smoke,
and make love till the dawn; stores and shops remained open all those
nights, inviting the populace to feasting and merriment. The poor worked
as usual during the month of fast; the well-to-do could ease their way
through it by sleeping during the day. Very pious persons spent the last
ten nights of Ramadan in</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE ISLAMIC SCENE 215</p>
<p>the mosque; on one of those nights, it was believed, Allah began to
reveal the Koran to Mohammed; that night was accounted “better than a
thousand months”; and simple devotees, uncertain which of the ten was
the “Night of the Divine Decree,” kept all ten with dire solemnity. On
the first day after Ramadan the Moslems celebrated the festival of Id
al- Fitr , or “Breaking of the Fast.” They bathed, put on new clothes,
saluted one another with an em - brace, gave alms and presents, and
visited the graves of their dead.</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Mecca was the fourth duty of Moslem faith. Pilgrimage
to holy places was traditional in the East; the Jew lived in hopes of
one day seeing Zion; and pious pagan Arabs, long before Mohammed, had
trekked to the Kaaba. Mohammed accepted the old custom because he knew
that ritual is less easily changed than belief; and perhaps because he
himself hankered after the Black Stone; by yielding to the old rite he
opened a wide door to the acceptance of Islam by all Arabia. The Kaaba,
purified of its idols, be- came for all Moslems the house of God; and
upon every Mohammedan the obligation was laid (with considerate
exceptions for the ailing and the poor) to make the Mecca pilgrimage “as
often as he can”— which was soon inter- preted as meaning once in a
lifetime. As Islam spread to distant lands, only a minority of Moslems
performed the pilgrimage; even in Mecca there are Moslems who have never
made a ritual visit to the Kaaba. 31</p>
<p>Doughty has described, beyond all rivalry, the panorama of the
pilgrimage caravan moving with fantastic patience across the desert,
caught between the hot fury of the sun and the swirling fire of the
sands; some 7000 believers, less or more, on foot or horse or donkey or
mule or lordly palanquin, but most tossed along between the humps of
camel s, “bowing at each long stalk - ing pace . . . making fifty
prostrations in every minute, whether we would or no, toward Mecca,” 32
covering thirty miles in a weary day, sometimes fifty to reach an oasis;
many pilgrims sickening and left behind; some dying and abandoned to
lurking hyenas or a slower death. At Medina the pilgrims halted to view
the tombs of Mohammed, Abu Bekr, and Omar I in the mosque of the
Prophet; near those sepulchers, says a popular tradition, a space is
reserved for Jesus the son of Miriam. 33</p>
<p>Sighting Mecca, the caravan pitched its camp outside the walls, for
the whole city was bar am, sacred; the pilgrims bathed, dressed in
seamless robes of white, and rode or walked in a line many miles long,
over dusty roads, to seek living quarters in the town. During their stay
in Mecca they were re- quired to abstain from all disputes, from sexual
relations, and from any sinful act. 34 In the months specially ordained
for pilgrimage the Holy City became a babbling concourse of tribes and
races suddenly doffing nationality and rank in the unanimity of ritual
and prayer. Into the great enclosure called the Mosque of Mecca these
thousands hurried in tense anticipation of a supreme experience; they
hardly noted the elegant minarets of the wall, or the arcades and
colonnades of the cloistered interior; but all stopped in awe at the
well</p>
<p>21 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>of Zemzem, whose water, said tradition, had slaked the thirst of
Ishmael; every pilgrim drank of it, however bitter its taste, however
urgent its effects; some bottled it to take home, to sip its saving
sanctity daily, and in the hour of death . 35 At last the worshipers,
all eyes and no breath, came, near the center of the enclosure, to the
Kaaba itself, a miniature temple illuminated within by silver hanging
lamps, its outer wall half draped with a curtain of rich and delicate
cloth; and in a comer of it the ineffable Black Stone. Seven times the
pilgrims walked around the Kaaba and kissed or touched or bowed to the
Stone. (Such circumambulation of a sacred object — a fire, a tree, a
maypole, an altar of the Temple at Jerusalem — was an old religious
ritual.) Many pil- grims, exhausted and yet sleepless with devotion,
passed the night in the en- closure, squatting on their rugs, conversing
and praying, and contemplating in wonder and ecstasy the goal of their
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>On the second day the pilgrims, to commemorate Hagar’s frantic search
for water for her son, ran seven times between the hills, Safa and
Marwa, that lay outside the city. . . . On the seventh day those who
wished to make the “major pilgrimage” streamed out to Mt. Ararat— six
hours’ journey distant — and heard a three-hour sermon; returning
halfway, they spent a night in prayer at the oratory of Muzdalifa; on
the eighth day they rushed to the valley of Mina and threw seven stones
at three marks or pillars, for so, they believed, Abraham had cast
stones at Satan when the Devil interrupted his preparations for slaying
his son. . . . On the tenth day they sacrificed a sheep, a camel, and
some other horned animal, ate the meat and distributed alms; this
ceremony, commemorating similar sacrifices by Mohammed, was the central
rite of the pilgrimage; and this “Festival of Sacrifice” wa s cele-
brated with like offerings to Allah by Moslems all over the world on the
tenth day of the pilgrimage period. The pilgrims now shaved their heads,
pared their nails, and buried the cuttings. This completed the Major
Pil- grimage; but usually the worshiper paid another visit to the Kaaba
before he returned to the caravan camp. There he resumed his profane
condition and clothing, and began with proud and comforted spirit the
long march back home.</p>
<p>This famous pilgrimage served many purposes. Like that of the Jews to
Jerusalem, of the Christians to Jerusalem or Rome, it intensified the
wor- shiper’s faith, and bound him by a collective emotional experience
to his creed and to his fellow believers. In the pilgrimage a fusing
piety brought together poor Bedouins from the desert, rich merchants
from the towns, Berbers, African Negroes, Syrians, Persians, Turks,
Tatars, Moslem In- dians, Chinese — all wearing the same simple garb,
reciting the same prayers in the same Arabic tongue; hence, perhaps, the
moderation of racial distinc- tions in Islam. The circling of the Kaaba
seems superstitious to the non- Moslem; but the Moslem smiles at similar
customs in other faiths, is disturbed by the Christian rite of eating
the god, and can understand it only as an ex-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE ISLAMIC SCENE 2 1 7</p>
<p>ternal symbol of spiritual communion and sustenance. All religions
are su- perstitions to other faiths.</p>
<p>And all religions, however noble in origin, soon carry an accretion
of su- perstitions rising naturally out of minds harassed and stupefied
by the fatigue of the body and the terror of the soul in the struggle
for continuance. Most Moslems believed in magic, and rarely doubted the
ability of sorcerers to di- vine the future, to reveal hidden treasures,
compel affection, afflict an enemy, cure disease, or ward off the evil
eye. Many believed in magic metamor- phoses of men into animals or
plants, or in miraculous transits through space; this is almost the
framework of the Arabian Nights. Spirits were everywhere, performing
every manner of trick and enchantment upon mortals, and be- getting
unwanted children upon careless women. Most Moslems, like half the
Christian world, wore amulets as protection against evil influences,
con- sidered some days lucky, other days unlucky, and believed that
dreams might reveal the future, and that God sometimes spoke to man in
dreams. Everyone in Islam, as in Christendom, accepted astrology; the
skies were charted not only to fix the orientation of mosques and the
calendar of re- ligious feasts, but to select a celestially propitious
moment for any important enterprise, and to determine the genethlialogy
of each individual — i.e., his character and fate as set by the position
of the stars at his birth.</p>
<p>Seeming to the outer world so indiscriminately one in ritual and
belief, Islam was early divided into sects as numerous and furious as in
Christendom. There were the martial, puritanic, democratic Kharijites;
Murji’ites who held that no Moslem would be everlastingly damned;
Jabrites who denied free will and upheld absolute predestination;
Qadarites who defended the freedom of the will; and many others; we pay
our respects to their sincerity and omniscience, and pass on. But the
Shi‘ites belong inesca pably to history. They overthrew the Umayyads,
captured Persian, Egyptian, and Indian Islam, and deeply affected
literature and philosophy. The Shia (i.e., group, sect) had its origin
in two murders — the assassination of Ali, and the slaughter of Husein
and his family. A large minority of Moslems argued that since Mohammed
was the chosen Apostle of Allah, it must have been Allah’s in - tent
that the Prophet’s descendants, inheriting some measure of his divine
spirit and purpose, should inherit his leadership in Islam. All caliphs
except Ali seemed to them usurpers. They rejoiced when Ali became
caliph, mourned when he was murdered, and were profoundly shocked by Hu-
sein’s death. Ali and Husein became saints in Shia worship; their
shrines were held second in holiness only to the Kaaba and the Prophet’s
tomb. Perhaps influenced by Persian, Jewish, and Christian ideas of a
Messiah, and the Buddhist conception of Bodhisattvas — repeatedly
incarnated saints — the Shi’ites considered the descendants of Ali to be
Imams (“exemplars”), i.e., infallible incarnations of divine wisdom. The
eighth Imam was Riza, whose tomb at Mashhad, in northeastern Persia, is
accounted the “Glory of the</p>
<p>2 l8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Shia World.” In 873 the tw elfth Imam — Muhammad ibn Hasan —
disappeared in the twelfth year of his age; in Shia belief he did not
die, but bides his time to reappear and lead the Shia Moslems to
universal supremacy and bliss.</p>
<p>As in most religions, the various sects of Islam felt toward one
another an animosity more intense than that with which they viewed the
“infidels” in their midst. To these Dhimrni — Christians, Zoroastrians,
Sabaeans, Jews — the Umayyad caliphate offered a degree of toleration
hardly equaled in contem- porary Christian lands. They were allowed the
free practice of their faiths, and the retention of their churches, on
condition that they wear a distinctive honey-colored dress, and pay a
poll tax of from one to four dinars (.75 to 9.00) per year according to
their income. This tax fell only upon non- Moslems capable of military
service; it was not levied upon monks, women, adolescents, slaves, the
old, crippled, blind, or very poor. In return the Dhimrni were excused
(or excluded) from military service, were exempt from the two and a half
per cent tax for community charity, and received the protection of the
government. Their testimony was not admitted in Moslem courts, but they
were allowed self-government under their own leaders, judges, and laws.
The degree of toleration varied with dynasties; the Successors were
spasmodically severe, the Umayyads generally lenient, the Abbasids
alternately lenient and severe. Omar I ejected all Jews and Christians
from Arabia as Islam’s Holy Land, and a quest ionable tradition ascribes
to him a “Covenant of Omar” restraining their rights in general; but
this edict, if it ever existed, was in practice ignored, 36 and Omar
himself con- tinued in Egypt the allowances formerly made to the
Christian churches by the Byzantine government.</p>
<p>The Jews of the Near East had welcomed the Arabs as liberators. They
suffered now divers disabilities and occasional persecutions; but they
stood on equal terms with Christians, were free once more to live and
worship in Jerusalem, and prospered under Islam in Asia, Egypt, and
Spain as never under Christian rule. Outside of Arabia the Christians of
western Asia usually practiced their religion unhindered; Syria remained
predominantly Christian until the third Moslem century; in the reign of
Mamun (813-33) we hear of 1 1,000 Christian churches in Islam — as well
as hundreds of synagogues and fire temples. Christian festivals were
freely and openly celebrated; Christian pilgrims came in safety to visit
Christian shrines in Palestine; 37 the Crusaders found large numbers of
Christians in the Near East in the twelfth century; and Christian
communities have survived there to this day. Christian heretics
persecuted by the patriarchs of Constantinople, Jerusalem, Alexandria,
or Antioch were now free and safe under a Moslem rule that found their
dis- putes quite unintelligible. In the ninth century the Moslem
governor of An- tioch appointed a special guard to keep Christian sects
from massacring one another at church. 38 Monasteries and nunneries
flourished under the skeptical Umayyads; the Arabs admired the work of
the monks in agriculture and</p>
<p>THE ISLAMIC SCENE</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>reclamation, acclaimed the wines of monastic vintage, and enjoyed, in
trav- eling, the shade and hospitality of Christian cloisters. For a
time relations between the two religions were so genial that Christians
wearing crosses on their breasts conversed in mosques with Moslem
friends. 39 The Mohammedan administrative bureaucracy had hundreds of
Christian employees; Christians rose so frequently to high office as to
provoke Moslem complaints. Sergius, father of St. John of Damascus, was
chief finance minister to Abd-al-Malik, and John himself, last of the
Greek Fathers of the Church, headed the council that governed Damascus.
40 The Christians of the East in general regarded Is- lamic rule as a
lesser evil than that of the Byzantine government and church. 41</p>
<p>Despite or because of this policy of tolerance in early Islam, the
new faith won over to itself in time most of the Christians, nearly all
the Zoroastrians and pagans, and many of the Jews, of Asia, Egypt, and
North Africa. It was a fiscal advantage to share the faith of the ruling
race; captives in war could escape slavery by accepting Allah, Mohammed,
and circumcision. Gradually the non-Moslem populations adopted the
Arabic language and dress, the laws and faith of the Koran. Where
Hellenism, after a thousand years of mastery, had failed to take root,
and Roman arms had left the native gods unconquered, and Byzantine
orthodoxy had raised rebellious heresies, Mo- hammedanism had secured,
almost without proselytism, not only belief and worship, but a tenacious
fidelity that quite forgot the superseded gods. From China, Indonesia,
and India through Persia, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt to Mo- rocco and
Spain, the Mohammedan faith touched the hearts and fancies of a hundred
peoples, governed their morals and molded their lives, gave them
consoling hopes and a strengthening pride, until today it owns the
passionate allegiance of 350,000,000 souls, and through all political
divisions makes them one.</p>

<li>THE PEOPLE</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the Umayyads the Arabs constituted a ruling aristocracy, and
en- joyed a stipend from the state; in return for these privileges, all
able-bodied Arab males were subject at any time to military service. As
conquerors they were proud of their supposedly unmixed blood and pure
speech. With keen genealogical consciousness the Arab added his father’s
name to his own, as in Abdallah ibn (son of) Zobeir; sometimes he added
his tribe and place of origin, and made a biography of a name, as in Abu
Bekr Ahmad ibn Jarir al-Azdi. Purity of blood became a myth as the
conquerors took conquered women as concubines, and reckoned their
offspring as Arabs; but pride of blood and rank remained. The higher
class of Arabs moved about on horse- back, clothed in white silk and a
sword; the commoner walked in baggy trousers, convoluted turban, and
pointed shoes; the Bedouin kept his flowing gown, head shawl and band.
Long drawers were prohibited by the Prophet,</p>
<p>220 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>but some Arabs ventured into them. All classes affected jewelry.
Women stimulated the male fancy with tight bodices, bright girdles,
loose and color- ful skirts. They wore their hair in bangs at the front,
curls at the side, braids at the back; sometimes they filled it out with
black silk threads; often they adorned it with gems or flowers.
Increasingly after the year 715, when out of doors, they veiled the face
below the eyes; in this way every woman could be romantic, for at any
age the eyes of Arab women are perilously beautiful. Women matured at
twelve and were old at forty; in the interval they inspired most of
Arabic poetry, and maintained the race.</p>
<p>The Moslem had no respect for celibacy, and never dreamed of
perpetual continence as an ideal state; most Moslem saints married and
had children. Perhaps Islam erred in the opposite direction, and carried
marriage to an extreme. It gave the sexual appetite so many outlets
within the law that pros- titution diminished for a time under Mohammed
and the Successors; but ex- haustion requires stimulation, and dancing
girls soon played a prominent role in the life of even the most married
Moslem male. Moslem literature, being intended only for male eyes and
ears, was sometimes as loose as male con- versation in a Christian land;
it contained a superabundance of deliberately erotic books; and Moslem
medical works gave much attention to aphrodisi- acs. 42 In strict
Mohammedan law fornication and pederasty were to be pun- ished with
death; but the growth of wealth brought an easier ethic, punished
fornication with thirty strokes, and winked at the spread of homosexual
love. 43 A class of professional homosexuals ( mukhannath ) arose who
imitated the costume and conduct of women, plaited their hair, dyed
their nails with henna, and performed obscene dances. 44 The Caliph
Suleiman ordered the mukhannath of Mecca castrated; and the Caliph
al-Hadi, coming upon two women attendants in Lesbian relations, beheaded
them on the spot. 45 Despite such discouragement homosexualism made
rapid progress; a few years after al- Hadi it was prevalent at Harun’s
court, and in the songs o f his favorite poet Abu Nuwas. The Moslem
male, separated from women before marriage by purdah, and surfeited with
them after marriage by the harem, fell into ir- regular relations; and
women, secluded from all men but relatives, slipped into similar
perversions.</p>
<p>The contact with Persia promoted both pederasty and purdah in Islam.
The Arabs had always feared, as well as admired, woman’s charms, and had
revenged themselves for instinctive subjection to them by the usual male
doubts about her virtue and intelligence. “Consult women,” said Omar I,
“and do the contrary of what they advise.” 46 But the Moslems of Moham -
med’s century had not secluded their women; the two sexes exchanged
visits, moved indiscriminately through the streets, and prayed together
in the mosque. 47 When Musab ibn al-Zobeir asked his wife Aisha why she
never veiled her face, she answered: “Since Allah, may He remain blessed
and ex - alted, hath put upon me the stamp of beauty, it is my wish that
the public</p>
<p>THE ISLAMIC SCENE</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>should view that beauty, and thereby recognize His grace unto them.”
48 Under Walid II (743-4) , however, the harem-and-eunuch system took
form, and purdah developed with it. Harim, like haram, meant forbidden,
sacred; the seclusion of women was originally due to their being tabu
because of menstruation or childbirth; the harem was a sanctuary. The
Moslem husband knew the passionate temper of the Oriental, felt a need
to protect his women, and saw no escape from their adultery except
through their incarceration. It became reprehensible for women to walk
in the streets except for short distances and veiled; they could visit
one another, but usually they traveled in curtained litters; and they
were never to be seen abroad at night. They were separated from the men
in the mosque by a screen or railing or gallery; finally they were
excluded altogether; 49 and religion, which in Latin Chris- tendom has
been described as a secondary sexual characteristic of the female,
became in Islam, as public worship, a prerogative of the male. Even more
cruelly, women were forbidden the pleasure of shopping; they sent out
for what they needed; and pedlars, usually women, came to spread their
wares on the harem floor. Rarely, except in the lower classes, did the
women sit at table with their husbands. It was unlawful for a Moslem to
see the face of any woman except his wives, slaves, and near relatives.
A physician was allowed to see only the afflicted part of a woman
patient. The man found the system very convenient; it gave him at home a
maximum of opportunity, and outside the home full freedom from
surveillance or surprise. As for the women themselves, until the
nineteenth century, there is no evidence that they objected to purdah or
the veil. They enjoyed the privacy, security, and comforts of the
zenana, or women’s quarters; they resented as an insult any negligence
of the husband in maintaining their seclusion; 50 and from their
apparent prison the legal wives still played a lively part in history.
Khaizuran, Harun’s mother, and Zobaida, his wife, rivaled in the eighth
and ninth cen - turies the influence and audacity of Aisha in the
seventh, and enjoyed a mag- nificence hardly dreamed of by Mohammed’s
wives.</p>
<p>The education of girls, in most ranks of the population, seldom went
be- yond learning their prayers, a few chapters of the Koran, and the
arts of the home. In the upper classes women received considerable
instruction, usually by private tutors, but sometimes in schools and
colleges; 51 they learned poetry, music, and many varieties of
needlework; some became scholars, even teachers. Several were famous for
enlightened philanthropy. They were taught a brand of modesty adapted to
their customs; surprised at the bath, they would cover their faces
first; they marveled at the immodesty of Euro- pean women who bared half
their bosoms at a ball and embraced divers men in a dance; and they
admired the forbearance of a God who did not strike such sinners dead.
52</p>
<p>As in most civilized countries, marriages were usually arranged by
the parents. The father might marry his daughter to whomever he wished
before</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>she became of age; after that she might choose. Girls were usually
married by the age of twelve, and were mothers at thirteen or fourteen;
some married at nine or ten; men married as early as fifteen. The
betrothal, or marriage contract, pledged the groom to give her a dowry;
this remained her property through marriage and divorce. The groom was
rarely allowed to see the face of his bride before marriage. The wedding
followed eight or ten days after the betrothal; it required no priest,
but was accompanied by brief prayers; it involved music, feasting, a
“shower” of g ifts, and a gay illumination of the bridegroom’s street
and house. After many ceremonies the husband, in the privacy of the
bridal chamber, drew aside the veil of his wife, and said, “In the name
of God the Compassionate, the Merciful.” 53</p>
<p>If this belated examination left the groom dissatisfied, he might at
once send the wife back to her parents with her dowry. Polygamy in Islam
was more often successive than simultaneous; only the rich could afford
plural wives. 54 Facility of divorce made it possible for a Moslem to
have almost any number of successive mates; Ali had 200; 55 Ibn
al-Teiyib, a dyer of Baghdad who lived to be eighty-five, is reported to
have married 900 wives. 50 In addi- tion to wives a Moslem might have
any number of concubines; Harun con- tented himself with 200, but
al-Mutawakkil, we are told, had 4000, each of whom shared his bed for a
night. 57 Some slave merchants trained female slaves in music, song, and
sexual seduction, and then sold them as concubines for as much as
100,000 dirhems (0,000). 58 But we must not think of the usual harem as
a private brothel. In most cases the concubines became moth- ers, and
prided themselves on the number and gender of their children; and there
were many instances of tender affection between master and concu- bine.
Legal wives accepted concubinage as a matter of course. Zobaida, wife of
Harun, presented him with ten concubines. 59 In this way a man’s house -
hold might contain as many children as an American suburb. A son of
Walid I had sixty sons and an unrecorded number of daughters. Eunuchs,
forbidden by the Koran, became a necessary appendage to the harem;
Chris- tians and Jews participated in importing or manufacturing them;
caliphs, viziers, and magnates paid high prices for them; and soon these
cunning castrati subjected many phases of Moslem government to their
narrow competence. In the early centuries after the conquest this harem
system pre- vented the Arabs from being ethnically absorbed by the
conquered popula- tion, and multiplied them to a number needed to rule
their spreading realm. Possibly it had some eugenic effect from the free
fertility of the ablest men; but after Mamun polygamy became a source of
moral and physical deterio- ration, and — as mouths grew faster than
food — of increasing poverty and dis- content.</p>

<p>considerable cost. The infidelities of her husband were quite beyond
her ken, and were accounted morally negligible; her own infidelity was
pun- ishable with death. It is remarkable how many adulteries she
managed to commit despite her handicaps. She was reviled and revered,
belittled and sup- pressed, and in most cases was loved with passion and
tenderness. “For my wife,” said Abu’l Atiyya, “I will gladly renounce
all the prizes of life and all the wealth of the world”; 00 such
professions were frequent, an d sometimes sincere. In one matter the
Moslem wife was favored as compared with some European women. Whatever
property she received was wholly at her dis- posal, not subject to any
claim of her husband or his creditors. Within the security of the zenana
she spun, wove, sewed, managed the household and the children, played
games, ate sweets, gossiped and intrigued. She was expected to bear many
children, as economic assets in an agricultural and patriarchal society;
the estimation in which she was held depended chiefly upon her
fertility; “a piece of old matting lying in a corner,” said Mohammed,
“is better than a barren wife.” 01 Nevertheless abortion and
contraception were widely practiced in the harem. Midwives transmitted
ancient tech- niques, and physicians offered new ones. Al-Razi (d. 924)
included in his Quintessence of Experience a section “on the means of
preventing concep - tion,” and listed twenty -four, mechanical or
chemical. 02 Ibn Sina (Avi- cenna, 980-1037), in his famous Qanun, gave
twenty contraceptive recipes.</p>
<p>In nonsexual morals the Mohammedan did not differ appreciably from
the Christian. The Koran more definitely denounced gambling and
intoxication (v, 90) ; but some gambling and much drinking continued in
both civili- zations. Corruption in government and judiciary flourished
in Islam as in Christendom. In general the Moslem seems to have excelled
the Christian in commercial morality, 63 fidelity to his word, and
loyalty to treaties signed; 64 Saladin was by common consent the best
gentleman of the Crusades. The Moslems were honest about lying; they
allowed a lie to save a life, to patch up a quarrel, to please a wife,
to deceive in war the enemies of the faith. 65 Moslem manners were both
formal and genial, and Moslem speech was heavy with compliments and
polite hyperbole. Like the Jews, the Moslems greeted one another with a
solemn bow and salutation: “Peace 〔 salaam 〕 be with you”; and the
proper reply of every Moslem was, “On you be peace, and the mercy and bl
essings of God.” Hospitality was universal and generous. Clean - liness
was a function of income; the poor were neglected and encrusted, the
well-to-do were scrubbed, manicured, and perfumed. Circumcision, though
not mentioned in the Koran, was taken for granted as a precaution of hy-
giene; boys underwent the operation at five or six. 66 Private baths
were a luxury of the rich, but public bathhouses were numerous; Baghdad
in the tenth century, we are told, had 27,ooo. 67 Perfumes and incense
were popular with men as well as with women. Arabia was famous of old
for its frankin</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>cense and myrrh; Persia for its oil of roses or violets or jasmine.
Gardens of shrubs, flowers, and fruit trees were attached to many homes;
and flowers were loved, above all in Persia, as the very fragrance of
life.</p>
<p>How did these people amuse themselves? Largely with feasting, venery
in both senses, flirtation, poetry, music, and song; to which the lower
orders added cockfights, ropedancers, jugglers, magicians, puppets. . .
. We find from Avicenna’s Qanun that the Moslems of the tenth century
had nearly all the sports and physical foibles of our time: boxing,
wrestling, running, archery, throwing the javelin, gymnastics, fencing,
riding, polo, croquet, weight lifting and ball playing with mallet,
hockey stick, or bat. 08 Games of chance being forbidden, cards and dice
were not much used; backgammon was popular; chess was allowed, though
Mohammed had denounced the carving of the pieces in the likeness of men.
Horse racing was popular, and was patronized by the caliphs; in one
program, we are informed, 4000 horses took part. Hunting remained the
most aristocratic of sports, less violent than in Sasanian times, and
often subsiding into falconry. Captured animals were sometimes used as
pets; some families had dogs, others monkeys; some caliphs kept lions or
tigers to awe subjects and ambassadors.</p>
<p>When the Arabs conquered Syria they were still half-barbarous tribes,
recklessly brave, violent, sensual, passionate, superstitious, and
skeptical. Islam softened some of these qualities, but most of them
survived. Probably the cruelties recorded of the caliphs were no worse
in total than those of contemporary Christian kings, Byzantine,
Merovingian, or Norse; but they were a disgrace to any civilization. In
717 Suleiman, on pilgrimage to Mecca, invited his courtiers to try their
swords on 400 Greeks recently captured in war; the invitation was
accepted and the 400 men were beheaded in merry sport as the Caliph
looked on. 09 Al-Mutawakkil, enthroned, cast into prison a vizier who
had, some years before, treated him with indignity; for weeks the
prisoner was kept awake to the point of insanity; then he was allowed to
sleep for twenty-four hours; so strengthened, he was placed between
boards lined with spikes, which prevented his moving without
self-laceration; so he lay in agony for days till he died. 70 Such
savagery, of course, was ex- ceptional; normally the Moslem was the soul
of courtesy, humanity, and tolerance. He was, if we may describe the
mythical average, quick of appre- hension and wit; excitable and lazy,
easily amused and readily cheerful; find- ing content in simplicity,
bearing misfortune calmly, accepting all events with patience, dignity,
and pride. Starting on a long journey, the Moslem took his grave linen
with him, prepared at any time to meet the Great Scav- enger; overcome
in the desert by exhaustion or disease, he would bid the others go on,
would perform his final ablutions, hollow out a pit for his grave, wrap
himself in his winding sheet, lie down in the trench, and wait for the
coming of death, and a natural burial by the wind-blown sands. 71</p>

<p>THE ISLAMIC SCENE</p>
<p>225</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GOVERNMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>Theoretically, in the generation after Mohammed, Islam was a
democratic republic in the ancient sense: all free adult males were to
share in choosing the ruler and determining policy. Actually the
Commander of the Faithful was chosen, and policy was decided, by a small
group of notables in Medina. This was to be expected; men being by
nature unequal in intelligence and scruple, democracy must at best be
relative; and in communities with poor communica- tion and limited
schooling some form of oligarchy is inevitable. Since war and democracy
are enemies, the expansion of Islam promoted one-man rule; unity of
command and quickness of decision were required by a martial and
imperialist policy. Under the Umayyads the government became frankly
monarchical, and the caliphate was transmitted by succession or trial of
arms.</p>
<p>Again theoretically, the caliphate was a religious rather than a
political office; the caliph was first of all the head of a religious
group, Islam; and his primary duty was to defend the faith; in theory
the caliphate was a theocracy, a govern- ment by God through religion.
The caliph, however, was not a pope or a priest, nor could he issufe new
decrees of the faith. In practice he enjoyed nearly absolute power,
limited by no parliament, no hereditary aristocracy, no priesthood, but
only by the Koran — which his paid pundits could interpret at his will.
Under this despotism there was some democracy of opportunity: any man
might rise to high office unless both his parents were slaves.</p>
<p>The Arabs, recognizing that they had conquered decadent but
well-organized societies, took over in Syria the Byzantine, in Persia
the Sasanian, administrative system; essentially the old order of life
in the Near East continued, and even the Hellenic-Oriental culture,
overleaping the barrier of language, revived in Moslem science and
philosophy. Under the Abbasids a complex system of central, provin-
cial, and local government took form, operated by a bureaucracy that
suffered little interruption from royal assassinations and palace
revolutions. At the head of the administrative structure was the hajib
or chamberlain, who in theory merely managed ceremony, but in practice
accumulated power by controlling entry to the caliph. Next in rank, but
(after Mansur) superior in power, was the vizier, who appointed and
supervised the officials of the government, and guided the policy of the
state. The leading bureaus were those of taxation, accounts,
correspondence, police, post, and a department of grievances, which
became a court of appeal from judicial or administrative decisions. Next
to the army in the caliph’s affections was the bureau of revenue; here
all the pervasive pertinacity</p>
<p>The public post, as under the Persians and Romans, served only the
govern- ment and very important persons; its chief use was to transmit
intelligence and</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>directives between the provinces and the capital, but it served also
as a vehicle of espionage by the vizier upon local officers. The system
issued itineraries, avail - able to merchants and pilgrims, giving the
names of the various stations, and the distances between them; these
itineraries were the basis of Arabic geography. Pigeons were trained and
used as letter carriers — the first such use known to his- tory (837).
Additional “intelligence” was provided by travelers and merchants, and
in Baghdad 1700 “aged women” served as spies. No amount of surveillance,
however, could check the Oriental- Occidental appetite for “squeeze” or
“graft.” The provincial governors, as in Roman days, expected their
tenure of office to reimburse them for the expenses of their climb and
the tribulations of their descent. The caliphs occasionally forced them
to disgorge their accumulations, or sold this right of squeezing to the
newly appointed government; so Yusuf ibn Omar extracted 76,000,000
dirhems from his predecessors in the government of Iraq. Judges were
well paid, yet they too could be influenced by the generous; and
Mohammed (says a tradition) was convinced that out of three judges at
least two would go to hell. 73</p>
<p>The law by which the great realm was ruled claimed to deduce itself
from the Koran. In Islam, as in Judaism, law and religion were one;
every crime was a sin, every sin a crime; and jurisprudence was a branch
of theology. As conquest extended the reach and responsibilities of
Mohammed’s impromptu legislation, and puzzled it with cases unforeseen
in the Koran, the Moslem jurists invented traditions that implicitly or
explicitly met their need; hence the Hadith became a second source of
Mohammedan law. By strange but repeated coincidence these useful
traditions echoed the principles and judgments of Roman and Byzantine
law, and still more of the Mishna or Gemara of the Jews. 74 The growing
mass and complexity of legal traditions gave sustenance and high status
to the legal profession in Islam; the jurists ( faqihs ) who expounded
or applied the law acquired by the tenth century almost the power and
sanctity of a priestly class. As in twelfth-century France, they allied
themselves with the monarchy, sup- ported the absolutism of the
Abbasids, and reaped rich rewards.</p>
<p>Four famous schools of law took form in orthodox Islam. Abu Hanifa
ibn Thabit (d. 767) revolutionized Koranic law by his principle of
analogical inter- pretation. A law originally enacted for a desert
community, he argued, must be interpreted analogously, not literally,
when applied to an industrial or urban society; on this basis he
sanctioned mortgage loans and interest (forbidden in the Koran), much a
s Hillel had done in Palestine eight centuries before. “The legal rule,”
said Hanifa, “is not the same as the rules of grammar and logic. It
expresses a general custom, and changes with the circumstances that
produced it.” 75 Against this liberal philosophy of progressive law the
conservatives of Medina put forth a strong defender in Malik ibn Anas
(715-95). Basing his system on a study of 1700 juridical Hadith, Malik
proposed that since most of these traditions had arisen in Medina, the
consensus of opinion in Medina should be the criterion of interpretation
of both the Hadith and the Koran. Muhammad al-Shafii (767-</p>
<p>820), living in Baghdad and Cairo, thought that infallibility should
have a wider base than Medina, and found in the general consensus of the
whole Moslem com- munity the final test of legality, orthodoxy, and
truth. His pupil Ahmad ibn</p>
<p>THE ISLAMIC SCENE</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>22 ?</p>
<p>Hanbal (780-855) considered this criterion too wide and vague, and
founded a fourth school on the principle that law should be determined
exclusively by the Koran and the traditions. He denounced the
rationalism of the Mutazilites in philosophy, was jailed for orthodoxy
by al-Mamun, but held so valiantly to his conservative position that
when he died almost the entire population of Baghdad attended his
funeral.</p>
<p>Despite this century-long debate, the four schools of law recognized
by ortho- dox Islam agreed in detail as much as they differed in
principle. They all assumed the divine origin of the Moslem law, and the
necessity of divine origin for any law adequate to control a naturally
lawless mankind. They all entered into such minute regulation of conduct
and ritual as only Judaism could equal; they pre- scribed the correct
use of toothpicks and matrimonial rights, the proper dress of the sexes,
and the moral arrangement of the hair. One legist never ate watermelon
because he could not find, in either the Koran or the Hadith, the
canonical method for such an operation. 76 The multiplicity of
enactments would have stifled human development; but legal fictions and
condoned evasions reconciled the rigor of the law with the flow and
vigor of life. Even so, and despite the wide acceptance of the
liberalizing Hanafite code, Mohammedan law tended to be too conserva-
tive, too inflexibly mortised in orthodoxy to allow a free evolution of
economy, morals, and thought.</p>
<p>With these provisos we must concede that the early caliphs, from Abu
Bekr to al-Mamun, gave successful organization to human life over a wide
area, and may be counted among the ablest rulers in history. They might
have devastated or confiscated everything, like the Mongols or the
Magyars or the raiding Norse; instead they merely taxed. When Omar
conquered Egypt he rejected the advice of Zobeir to divide the land
among his follow- ers, and the Caliph confirmed his judgment: “Leave
it,” said Omar, “in the people’s hands to nurse and fructify .” 77 Under
the caliphal government lands were measured, records were systematically
kept, roads and canals were mul- tiplied or maintained, rivers were
banked to prevent floods; Iraq, now half desert, was again a garden of
Eden; Palestine, recently so rich in sand and stones, was fertile,
wealthy, and populous . 78 Doubtless the exploitation of simplicity and
weakness by cleverness and strength went on under this sys- tem as under
all governments; but the caliphs gave reasonable protection to life and
labor, kept career open to talent, promoted for three to six centuries
the prosperity of areas never so prosperous again, and stimulated and
sup- ported such a flourishing of education, literature, science,
philosophy, and art as made western Asia, for five centuries, the most
civilized region in the world.</p>
<p>V. THE CITIES</p>
<p>Before searching out the men and the works that gave meaning and dis-
tinction to this civilization we must try to visualize the environment
in which</p>
<p>228 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>they lived. Civilization is rural in base but urban in form; men must
gather in cities to provide for one another audiences and stimuli.</p>
<p>Moslem towns were nearly all of modest size, with 10,000 souls or
less, cramped into a small and usually walled area for protection
against raid or siege, with unlit streets of dust or mud, and little
stucco houses hugging their privacy behind a forbidding continuum of
external wall; all the glory of the town was concentrated in the mosque.
But here and there rose the cities in which Moslem civilization touched
its summits of beauty, learning, and happiness.</p>
<p>In Moslem sentiment both Mecca and Medina were holy cities, one as
the seat of the ancient Arab shrine and the birthplace of the Prophet,
the other as his refuge and home. Walid II rebuilt in splendor the
modest mosque at Medina; at Wali d’s urging, and for 80,000 dinars, the
Byzantine emperor sent forty loads of mosaic stones, and eighty
craftsmen from Egypt and Greece; the Moslems complained that their
Prophet’s mosque was being built by Christian infidels. Despite the
Kaaba and this mosque, the two cities took on under the Umayyads an
aspect of worldly pleasure and luxury that would have shocked the
earlier caliphs, and must have gladdened the trium- phant Quraish. The
spoils of conquest had flowed into Medina, and had been distributed
chiefly to its citizens; pilgrims were coming to Mecca in greater
number, and with richer offerings than ever before, enormously
stimulating trade. The holy cities became centers of wealth, leisure,
gaiety, and song; palaces and suburban villas housed an aristocracy
surfeited with servants and slaves; concubines accumulated, forbidden
wine flowed, singers strummed pleasantly sad melodies, and poets
multiplied rhymes of war and love. At Medina the beautiful Suqainah,
daughter of the martyred Husein, presided over a salon of poets,
jurists, and statesmen. Her wit, charm, and good taste set a standard
for all Islam; she could not count her successive husbands on her
jeweled fingers; and in some instances she made it a condition of
marriage that she should retain full freedom of action. 79 The Umayyad
spirit of joie de vivre had conquered the abstemious puritanism of Abu
Bekr and Omar in the most sacred centers of Islam.</p>
<p>Jerusalem was also a holy city to Islam. Already in the eighth
century the Arabs predominated in its population. The Caliph
Abd-al-Malik, envying the splendor with which the church of the Holy
Sepulcher had been restored after its destruction by Khosru Parvez,
lavished the revenues of Egypt to surpass that shrine with a group of
structures known to the Moslem world as Al-Haram al-Sharif (the
venerable sanctuary) . At the south end was built (691-4) Al-Masjid
al-Aqsa — “The Farther Mosque”— so named after a pas- sage in the Koran
(xvii, 1). It was ruined by earthquake in 746, restored in 785, and
often modified; but the nave goes back to Abd-al-Malik, and most of the
columns to Justinian’s basilica in Jerusalem. Muqaddasi considered it
more beautiful than the Great Mosque at Damascus. Somewhere in the
sacred</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE ISLAMIC SCENE 229</p>
<p>enclosure, it was said, Mohammed had met Abraham, Moses, and Jesus,
and had prayed with them; near by he had seen the rock (reckoned by
Israel to be the center of the world) where Abraham had thought to
sacrifice Isaac, and Moses had received the Ark of the Covenant, and
Solomon and Herod had built their temples; from that rock Mohammed had
ascended into heaven; if one but had faith he could see in the rock the
footprints of the Prophet. In 684, when the rebel Abdallah ibn Zobeir
held Mecca and re- ceived the revenues of its pilgrims, Abd-al-Malik,
anxious to attract some of this sacred revenue, decreed that thereafter
this rock should replace the Kaaba as the object of pious pilgrimage.
Over that historic stone his artisans (691) raised in Syrian- Byzantine
style the famous “Dome of the Rock,” which soon ranked as the third of
the “four wonders of the Moslem world” (the others were the mosques of
Mecca, Medina, and Damascus) . It was not a mosque, but a shrine to
house the rock; the Crusaders erred twice in calling it the “Mosque of
Omar.” Upon an octagonal building of squared stones, 528 feet in
circuit, rises a dome, 1 1 2 feet high, made of wood externally covered
with gilded brass. Four elegant portals — their lintels faced by
splendid repousse bronze plates — lead into an interior divided into
diminishing octagons by concentric colonnades of polished marbles; the
magnificent columns were taken from Roman ruins, the capitals were
Byzantine. The spandrels of the arches are distinguished by mosaics
depicting trees with all the delicacy of a Courbet; even finer are the
mosaics of the drum below the dome. Running around the cornice of the
outer colonnade, in yellow letters on blue tiles, is an inscription in
Kufic — the angular characters favored in Kufa; Saladin had it set up in
1 187; it is a lovely example of this unique form of architectural
decoration. Within the colonnade is the massive, shapeless rock, 200
feet around. “At dawn,” wrote Muqaddasi,</p>
<p>when the light of the sun first strikes on the cupola, and the
drum</p>
<p>reflects his rays, then is this edifice a marvelous sight to behold,
and such that in all Islam I have never seen the equal; neither have I
heard tell of aught built in pagan times that rivals in grace this Dome
of the Rock. 80</p>
<p>Abd-al- Malik’s plan to make this monument replace the Kaaba failed;
had it succeeded, Jerusalem would have been the center of all the three
faiths that competed for the soul of medieval man.</p>
<p>But Jerusalem was not even the capital of the province of Palestine;
that honor went to al-Ramlah. Many places that are now poor villages
were in Moslem days flourishing towns. “Aqqa” (Acre) “is a large city,
spaciously laid out,” wrote Muqaddasi in 985; “Sidon is a large city,
surrounded by gardens and trees,” wrote Idrisi in 1154. “Tyre is a
beautiful place,” wrote Yaqubi in 891, built on a rock jutting out into
the Mediterranean; “its inns are five or six stories high,” wrote
Nasir-i- Khosru in 1047, “and great is the quan tity of wealth exposed
in its</p>
<p>230 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>clean bazaars.” 81 Tripoli, to the north, had “a fine harbor, capable
of holding a thousand ships.” Tiberias was famous for its hot springs
and its jasmines. Of Nazareth the Moslem travel er Yaqut wrote in 1224:
“Here was born the Messiah Isa, the son of Mariam — peace be upon him! .
. . But the people of this place cast dishonor upon her, saying that
from all time no virgin has ever borne a child.” 82 Baalbek, said
Yaqubi, “is one of the finest towns in Syria”; “prosperous and pleas -
ant,” added Muqaddasi. Antioch was second only to Damascus among the
cities of Syria; the Moslems held it from 635 to 964, the Byzantines
then till 1084; the Mohammedan geographers admired its many beautiful
Christian churches, its rising terraces of pretty homes, its lush
gardens and parks, the running water in every house. Tarsus was a major
city; Ibn Hawqal (978) reckoned its male adults at 100,000; the Greek
Emperor Nicephorus recaptured it in 965, destroyed all the mosques, and
burned all the Korans. Aleppo was enriched by the junction there of two
caravan routes: the city “is populous and built of stone,” wrote Muqad -
dasi; “shady streets, with rows of shops, lead to each of the gates of
the mosque”; in that shrine was a mihrab famous for the beauty of its
carved ivory and wood, and a minbar “most exquisite to behold”; near by
were five colleges, a hospital, and six Christian churches. Homs (the
ancient Emesa) “is one of the largest cities</p>
<p>The eastward sweep of the Arab empire favored for its capital a site
more central than either Mecca or Jerusalem; and the Umayyads wisely
chose Da- mascus — already heavy with centuries when the Arabs came.
Five converging streams made its hinterland the “Garden of the Earth,”
fed a hundred public fountains, a hundred public baths, and 1 20,000
gardens, 84 and flowed out westward into a “Valley of Violets” twelve
miles long and three miles wide. “Damascus,” said Idrisi, “is the most
delightful of all God’s cities.” 85 In the heart of the town, amid a
population of some 140,000 souls, rose the palace of the caliphs, built
by Muawiya I, gaudy with gold and marble, brilliant with mosaics in
floors and walls, cool with ever-flowing fountains and cas- cades. On
the north side stood the Great Mosque, one of 572 mosques in the city,
and the sole surviving relic of Umayyad Damascus. In Roman days a temple
of Jupiter had adorned the site; on its ruins Theodosius I had built
(379) the cathedral of St. John the Baptist. Walid I, about 705,
proposed to the Christians that the cathedral should be remodeled and
form part of a new mosque, and promised to give them ground and
materials for another cathedral anywhere else in the city. They
protested, and warned him that “it is written in our books that he who
dest roys this church will choke to death”; but Walid began the
destruction with his own hands. The whole land tax of the empire, we are
told, was devoted for seven years to the construction of the mosque; in
addition a large sum was given to the Christians to finance a new
cathedral. Artists and artisans were brought in from India, Persia, Con-
stantinople, Egypt, Libya, Tunis, and Algeria; all together 12,000
workmen</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) THE ISLAMIC SCENE 23I</p>
<p>were employed, and the task was completed in eight years. Moslem
travelers unanimously describe it as the most magnificent structure in
Islam; and the Abbasid caliphs al-Mahdi and al-Mamun — no lovers of the
Umayyads or Damascus — ranked it above all other buildings on the earth.
A great battle- mented wall, with interior colonnades, enclosed a
spacious marble-paved court. On the south side of this enclosure rose
the mosque, built of squared stones and guarded by three minarets — one
of which is the oldest in Islam. Ground plan and decoration were
Byzantine, and were doubtless influenced by St. Sophia. The roof and
dome — fifty feet in diameter — were covered with plates of lead. The
interior, 429 feet long, was divided into nave and aisles by two tiers
of white marble columns, from whose gold-plated Corinthian capitals
sprang round or horseshoe arches, the first Moslem examples of this
latter form.* The mosaic floor was covered with carpets; the walls were
faced with colored marble mosaics and enameled tiles; six beautiful
grilles of marble divided the interior; in one wall, facing Mecca, was a
mihrab lined with gold, silver, and precious stones. Lighting was
effected through seventy- four windows of colored glass, and 1 2,000
lamps. “If,” said a traveler, “a man were to sojourn here a hundred
years, and pondered each day on what he saw, he would see something new
every day.” A Greek ambassador, allowed to enter it, confessed to his
associates: “I had told our Senate that the power of the Arabs would
soon pass away; but now, seeing here how they have built, I know that of
a surety their dominion will endure great length of days.” 87 1</p>
<p>Striking northeast from Damascus across the desert, one came to Raqqa
on the Euphrates, royal seat of Harun al-Rashid; and then through Hatra
and across the Tigris to Mosul; farther northeast lay Tabriz, whose
finest age was still to come; then, to the east, Tehran (as yet a minor
town), Damghan, and — east of the Caspian — Gurgan. In the tenth century
this was a provincial capital noted for its cultured princes; the
greatest of them, Shams al-Maali Qabus, was a poet and scholar who
sheltered Avicenna at his court, and left behind him, as his tomb, a
gigantic tower 167 feet high, the Gunbad-i-Qabus, the only structure
standing of a once populous and prosperous city. Along the northern
route to the east lay Nishapur, still melodious in Omar Khayyam’s verse;
Mashhad, the Mecca of Shia Moslems; Merv, capital of a once mighty
province; and — usually beyond the reach of the caliph’s taxgatherers—
Bokhara and Samarkand. Over the mountain ranges to the south lay Ghazni.

Damascus suffered by fire in 1069, was restored, was burnt almost to the
ground by Timur in 1400, was rebuilt, and was severely injured by fire
in 1894; since then plaster and whitewash have replaced the medieval
decoration. On one wall of the mosque may still be seen the inscription
that had overhung the lintel of the Christian church, and which the
Moslems ne ver erased: “Thy kingdom, O Christ, is an everlasting
kingdom, and Thy dominion endureth forever.” 88</li>

one could find in the eleventh century a dozen prosperous cities in Iran
— Herat, Shiraz (with its famous gardens and lovely mosque), Yazd,
Isfahan, Kashan, Qasvin, Qum, Hamadan, Kirmanshah, Samana; and in Iraq
the populous cities of Basra and Kufa. Everywhere the traveler could see

<p>It was an old Babylonian city, and not far from ancient Babylon;
bricks bear- ing Nebuchadrezzar’s name were found in 1848 under the
Tigris there. It throve under the Sasanian kings; after the Moslem
conquest it became the seat of several Christian monasteries, mostly
Nestorian. From these monks, we are told, the Caliph al-Mansur learned
that the site was cool in summer, and free from the mosquitoes that
harassed Kufa and Basra. Perhaps the Caliph thought it advisable to put
some distance between himself and those unruly cities, already swelling
with a revolutionary proletariat; and doubt- less he saw strategic
advantage in a site safely inland, yet in touch by water, through the
Tigris and the major canals, with all the cities on the two rivers, and
then through the Gulf with all the ports of the world. So in 762 he
transferred his residence from Hashimiya, and the governmental offices
from Kufa, to Baghdad, surrounded the site with a threefold circular
wall and a moat, changed its official name from Baghdad (“Gift of God”)
to Medina t - al- Salam (“City of Peace”) , and employed 1 00,000 men to
build in four years great brick palaces for himself, his relatives, and
the bureaus of the govern- ment. At the center of this “Round City of al
- Mansur” rose the caliphal pal - ace, called the “Golden Gate” from its
gilded entrance, or the “Green Dome” from its gleaming cupola. Outside
the walls, and directly on the west bank of the Tigris, al- Mansur built
a summer residence, the “Palace of Eternity”; here, for most of his
years, Harun al-Rashid made his home. From the win- dows of these
palaces one might see a hundred vessels unloading on the docks the wares
of half the earth.</p>
<p>In 768, to provide his son al-Mahdi with independent quarters,
al-Mansur built a palace and a mosque on the eastern or Persian side of
the river. Around these buildings a suburb grew, Rusafa, connected with
the Round City by</p>

<p>233</p>
<p>two bridges resting on boats. As most of the caliphs after Harun made
their dwelling in this suburb, it soon outstripped the city of Mansur in
size and wealth; after Harun “Baghdad” means Rusafa. From the royal
centers, on either side of the Tigris, narrow crooked streets, designed
to elude the sun, led out their chasms of noisy shops to the residential
districts of the well-to- do. Each craft had its street or mart —
perfumers, basket weavers, wire-pullers (in the literal sense),
money-changers, silk weavers, booksellers. . . . Over the shops and
beyond them were the homes of the people. Almost all dwell- ings but
those of the rich were of unbaked brick, made for a lifetime, but not
for much longer. We have no reliable statistics of the population;
probably it reached 800,000; some authorities estimate it at
2,000,000;°° in any case it was in the tenth century the largest city in
the world, with the possible exception of Constantinople. There was a
crowded Christian quarter, with churches, monasteries, and schools;
Nestorians, Monophysites, and orthodox Christians had there their
separate conventicles. Harun rebuilt and enlarged an early mosque of
al-Mansur, and al-Mutadid rebuilt and enlarged this mosque of Harun.
Doubtless several hundred additional mosques served the hopes of the
people.</p>
<p>While the poor solaced life with heaven, the rich sought heaven on
earth. In or near Baghdad they raised a thousand splendid mansions,
villas, palaces — simple without, but “within, nothing but azure and
gold.” We may imagine this domestic splendor from an incredible passage
in Abulfeda, which assures us that the royal palace at Baghdad had on
its floors 22,000 carpets, and on its walls 38,000 tapestries, 12,500 of
silk. 91 The residences of the caliph and his family, the vizier, and
the governmental heads occupied a square mile of the eastern city. Jafar
the Barmakid inaugurated an aristocratic migration by building in
southeastern Baghdad a mansion whose splendor contributed to his death.
He tried to evade Harun’s jealousy by presenting the palace to Mamun;
Harun accepted it for his son, but Jafar continued to live and frolic in
the “Qasr Jafari” till his fall. When the palaces of al -Mansur and
Harun began to crumble, new palaces replaced them. Al-Mutadid spent
400,000 dinars (,900,000) on his “Palace of the Pleiades” (892); we may
judge its extent from the 9000 horses, camels, and mules that were
housed in its stables. 92 Al- Muqtafi built next to this his “Palace of
the Crown” (902), which, with its gardens, covered nine square miles.
Al-Muqtadir raised in his turn the “Hall of the Tree,” s o named because
in its garden pond stood a tree of silver and gold; on the silver leaves
and twigs perched silver birds, whose beaks piped mechanical lays. The
Buwayhid sultans outspent them all by lavishing 13,000,000 dirhems upon
the Muizziyah Palace. When Greek ambassadors were received by
al-Muqtadir in 917, they were impressed by the twenty-three palaces of
the Caliph and his government, the porticoes of marble columns, the
number, size, and beauty of the rugs and tapestries that almost covered
floors and walls, the thousand grooms in shining uniforms,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>the gold and silver saddles and brocaded saddlecloths of the
emperor’s horses, the variety of tame or wild animals in the spacious
parks, and the royal barges, themselves palaces, that rode on the
Tigris, waiting the Caliph’s whim.</p>
<p>Amid these splendors the upper classes lived a life of luxury, sport,
worry, and intrigue. They went to the Maydan or plaza to watch horse
races or polo games; drank precious forbidden wine, and ate foods
brought from the greatest possible distances at the greatest possible
price; robed themselves and their ladies in gorgeous and colorful
raiment of silk and gold brocade; per- fumed their clothing, hair, and
beards; breathed the aroma of burning am- bergris or frankincense; and
wore jewelry on their heads, ears, necks, wrists, and feminine ankles;
“the clinking of thine anklets,” sang a poet to a lass, “has bereft me
of reason.” 93 Usually women were excluded from the social gath- erings
of the men; poets, musicians, and wits took their place, and doubtless
sang or spoke of love; and willowy slave girls danced till the men were
their slaves. Politer groups listened to poetic readings, or recitations
of the Koran; some formed philosophical clubs like the Brethren of
Purity. About 790 we hear of a club of ten members: an orthodox Sunni, a
Shi’ite, a Kharijite, a Manichean, an erotic poet, a materialist, a
Christian, a Jew, a Sabaean, and a Zoroastrian; their meetings, we are
told, were marked by mutual tolerance, good humor, and courteous
argument. 94 In general Moslem society was one of excellent manners;
from Cyrus to Li Hung Chang the East has surpassed the West in courtesy.
It was an ennobling aspect of this Baghdad life that all the permitted
arts and sciences found there a discriminating patronage, that schools
and colleges were numerous, and the air resounded with poetry.</p>
<p>Of the life of the common people we are told little; we may only
assume that they helped to uphold this edifice of grandeur with their
services and their toil. While the rich played with literature and art,
science and philos - ophy, the simpler folk listened to street singers,
or strummed their own lutes and sang their own songs. Now and then a
wedding procession redeemed the din and odor of the streets; and on
festive holydays people visited one an- other, exchanged presents with
careful calculation, and ate with keener relish than those who feasted
from plates of gold. Even the poor man gloried in the majesty of the
caliph and the splendor of the mosque; he* shared some dirhems of the
dinars that were taxed into Baghdad; he carried himself with the pride
and dignity of a capital; and in his secret heart he numbered himself
among the rulers of the world.</p>
