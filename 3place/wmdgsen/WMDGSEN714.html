<h4 id="chapter-iii">CHAPTER III</h4>
<p>The Rulers</p>
<p>I. GEORGE I: 1714-27</p>
<p>T HE English, as Voltaire and Montesquieu were soon to perceive, were
much cleverer than the French in the matter of government. Having
beheaded one sovereign and sent another scurrying in fright across the
Channel, they now imported a king who had left his heart and mind in
Germany, who took long leaves of absence in his native Hanover, and who
could readily be ruled by a Parliament whose ways and language he could
never understand.</p>
<p>The house of Hanover had its roots in medieval Germany, tracing its
princely lineage through the dukes of Brunswick-Liineburg to Henry the
Lion (1129-95), a °d beyond him to his Welf, or Guelph, ancestry. Han-
over itself became an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. Its
first Elector, Ernest Augustus, married Sophia, granddaughter of James I
of England. After the death of Ernest his widow, by Parliament’s Act of
Set - tlement (1701), became heiress to the English throne.</p>
<p>Her son George Louis, second Elector of Hanover, clouded this happy
heritage by an unhappy marriage. His wife, Sophia Dorothea, resented his
infidelities, and planned elopement with Count Philipp von Konigsmarck,
handsome colonel of the guards. George discovered the plot; the Count
was never heard of again, and was presumably put to death ( 1 694) .
Sophia Dor- othea was arrested and tried, her marriage was annulled, and
she was im- prisoned for the remaining thirty-two years of her life in
the castle of Ahlden. She had borne to her husband a daughter who became
the mother of Frederick the Great, and a son who became George II of
England.</p>
<p>Sophia, Dowager Electress of Hanover, died in 1714, two months before
the passing of Queen Anne; therefore she missed royalty, but her son was
at once proclaimed George I of Great Britain and Ireland. On September
18 he reached England, beginning a new epoch in English history. He
brought with him his son and daughter-in-law, a number of German aides,
and two mistresses: Charlotte von Kielmannsegge, whom he made Coun- tess
of Darlington, and Countess Melusina von der Schulenburg, whom he made
Duchess of Kendal and perhaps his wife. England might have ac- cepted
this arrangement as in accord with the morals of the time, but both</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>ladies, to British eyes and purse, were ugly and costly. Melusina
sold her influence for such fat sums that even Walpole, superintendent
of corrup- tion, complained; whereupon George asked had not Walpole
himself re- ceived fees for his recommendations to office? 1</p>
<p>In 1714 George I was fifty- four years old, tall and soldierly, a
“plain,</p>
<p>blunt man” who cared not a pfennig for books, but had shown his
courage on more than one battlefield. Lady Mary Montagu called hi m “an
honest blockhead,” 2 but he was not as dull as he seemed; and she
admitted that “he was passively good-natured, and wished all mankind
enjoyed quiet, if they would let him do so.” 3 He could not be expected
to feel at home in so un - familiar an environment, so uncertain an
employment. He had been hired by the British oligarchy to forestall a
second Stuart restoration; he had no “divine right” or personal claim to
the throne; he saw that these masterly Englishmen who ruled Parliament
were bent on ruling him too; and he could scarcely forgive them for
speaking English. He thought them inferior to his Hanoverian associates.
He withdrew into the recesses of St. James’s Palace, fled to Hanover
almost annually, and did all that he could to divert. English funds and
policy to the protection of his beloved electorate.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, his own son hated him as a murderer. George
Augustus, now Prince of Wales, denounced the continuing imprisonment of
his mother, rebelled against the ascendancy and airs of the regal mis-
tresses, quarreled with the King’s ministers, and made his views so
clear that</p>
<p>This schism in the reigning family accorded more or less with the
divi- sion of the ruling minority and the Parliament into Tories and
Whigs. Vol- taire estimated that some eight hundred men controlled
municipal govern- ment, elections to Parliament, national legislation,
administration, and the judiciary. 4 There was no longer any troublesome
talk about democracy, such as had been raised by Cromwell’s Independents
and the Levellers. Voting for Parliament was limited to property owners
— some 160,000 in this period 5 — and these normally accepted the
candidate recommended by the local squire or lord.® Politicians were
Tory or Whig according as they fa- vored either the titled nobility or
the gentry (lesser landowners) and the commercial interests. “Church of
England men” followed the Tory line; Dissenters supported the Whigs. The
Tories had opposed the subordination of the monarch to the Parliament;
they clung, with the Established Church, to the theory of divine right
in kings; in the last days of Queen Anne they had thought of recalling
the exiled Stuarts to power; naturally, now that the</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE RULERS 91</p>
<p>house of Hanover was enthroned, they were displaced by the anti-
Jacobite Whigs. Whereas heretofore the ministries had usually included
men from both parties, George I called only Whigs to high office, and so
established government by party through a cabinet. And since, not
understanding Eng- lish, he soon ceased to preside over cabinet
meetings, the dominant member became “prime minister,” and took over
more and more of the functions and powers of the king.</p>
<p>The ministry was led for seven years by James Stanhope. One of his
first and most popular acts was to restore John Churchill, Duke of
Marlborough — who had been impeached by the Tories — to all his former
offices, espe- cially as captain general of the army. Returning from
exile, the Duke re- tired to Blenheim Palace; there he suffered a long
illness, and died on June 16, 1722. The nation, forgiving his
acquisitions and remembering his unin- terrupted victories, accepted
Bolingbroke’s verdict— “He was so great a man that I do not recollect
whether he had any faults or not.” 7 His widow, the Sarah Churchill who
had for a decade ruled a queen, spent twenty-two years cherishing and
defending his memory. When the Duke of Somerset asked her in marriage,
she answered, “If I was young and handsome as I was, instead of old and
faded as I am, and you could lay the empire of the world at my feet, you
should never share the heart and hand that once be- longed to John
Churchill.” 8 In 1743, a year before her death at eighty -four, she
proposed to burn her early love letters, but reading them again she felt
“I could not do it,” and let them survive. 9 There must have been much
good in a woman who could so faithfully love, and in a man who could win
such devotion from so difficult a woman.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke replaced Marlborough in exile. Dismissed from the govern-
ment by George I, threatened with impeachment for secretly negotiating
with the fallen dynasty, hated by the Whigs and Dissenters whom he stung
with his wit, and shunned by churchmen as a scorner of Christian
theology, he fled to France (March, 1715), joined James III, became his
secretary of stateless state, helped to organize a Jacobite rebellion in
England, and pro- posed an invasion of England from France. Parliament
declared him guilty of treason, confiscated his property, and condemned
him to death.</p>
<p>The movement to restore the Stuarts almost toppled George I. The To-
ries, hating the Hanoverians as usurpers and boors; the common people of
England, rooted in old loyalties, and secretly longing for the banished
dy- nasty; the upper and lower classes of Scotland, proud of having
given a Scottish king to England, and fretting under the Act of Union
(1707) which had ended the Scottish Parliament — all were ready to abet
an invasion by the youth whom Louis XIV had recognized as the only
legitimate king of England.</p>
<p>James Francis Edward Stuart was now (1715) twenty-seven, though
his-</p>
<p>92 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>tory knows him as “the Old Pretender.” He had been brought up in
France, and so steeped in the Catholic faith by monastic teachers and
the sufferings of his father, James II, that he rejected Bolingbroke’s
plea that he should strengthen the Jacobite sentiment in England by
promising conversion to Protestantism. How, Bolingbroke argued, could
the Presbyterian Scots and the Tory Anglicans be roused to the support
of a man bringing to their throne the religion that they had through a
century of turmoil fought to overthrow? James was obdurate; he declared
that he would rather be a throneless Catholic than a Protestant king.
Bolingbroke, free from faith and principles, pronounced him fitter to be
a monk than a king. 10 Meanwhile (August, 1714) Parliament had offered
,£100,000 f° r the capture of</p>
<p>James III in case he should land on British soil.</p>
<p>A personal factor appeared to turn events to the Preten der’s cause.
John Erskine, Earl of Mar, had been secretary of state for Scotland in
the final years of Queen Anne. Dismissed by George I, he laid plans for
a Jacobite rising in England, then sailed to Scotland and called upon
the Scots to join his standard of revolt (September 6, 1715). Several
nobles rallied to him, raising his forces to six thousand foot and six
hundred horses; but Edin- burgh, Glasgow, and the southern Lowlands
adhered to the Hanoverian. The British government decreed death for
treason, and confiscation of prop- erty, against all rebels; it
mobilized thirteen thousand men, and called six thousand more to the
fleet; and it ordered the Duke of Argyll, commanding the garrisons at
Edinburgh and Stirling, to suppress the rebellion. He met Mar’s forces
at Sheriffmuir (November 13, 1715) in an engagement from which neither
side could claim a decisive victory. Another Scottish force of two
thousand, instead of joining Mar, advanced recklessly to within thirty
miles of Liverpool, vainly hoping to inspire and protect Jacobite up-
risings in the English towns. At Preston a government army surrounded it
and compelled its unconditional surrender (November 14).</p>
<p>James III must have known of these events before he sailed from
Dunkirk on December 27. Bolingbroke had warned him that no Jacobite
revolt would rise in England. The Pretender was carried on by faith in
the divine legitimacy of his cause, plus 100,000 crowns from the French
government, and thirty thousand from the Vatican. Landing in Scotland,
he joined Mar’s army at Perth, and made plans for a solemn coronation at
Scone. But his taci- turnity and melancholy countenance, and his
complaint that he had been deceived about the extent of the rebellion,
added nothing to the enthusiasm of the Scots; they complained in their
turn that they never saw him smile, and rarely heard him speak; 11
moreover, he was shaking from the ague, and bore the northern winter
hardly. Mar judged his troops unfit for battle; he ordered them to
retreat to Montrose, and to bum all towns, villages, and crops in their
wake as a measure to halt Argyll’s pursuit. James lamented the</p>
<p>chap, m)</p>
<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>destruction, and left money in part compensation for those whose
property had suffered. Then, as Argyll’s greatly superior army
approached Montrose, James, Mar, and other leaders of the revolt fled
precipitately to the coast, and took ship to France (February 4, 1716).
Everywhere the rebel forces surrendered or dispersed.</p>
<p>Most of the prisoners were transported to servitude in the colonies;
fifty- seven were executed, and a dozen Scottish nobles, now refugees in
France, were marked for death if ever they returned. James had hoped
that Philippe d’Orleans would send troops t o his rescue in Scotland;
but France was now contemplating an alliance with England, and urged
James to leave French soil. He settled for a time at papal Avignon, and
then in Rome.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke remained in France till 1723, and, knowing French well,
made himsdf at home in the salons and among the philosophers. Clever in
everything but politics, he bought shares in Law’s System, and sold at
great</p>
<p>The suppression of the revolt had left a few nobles headless, but it
had not reduced Jacobite sentiment in Britain. By the Triennial Acts of
1641 and 1694 no Parliament was to last over three years. Hence the
first Parlia- ment of George I faced in 1717 the prospect of an election
in which a Tory and Jacobite majority might be returned. To guard
against this the Parlia- ment, by the Septennial Act of 1716, voted
itself four additional years of life, and ruled that thereafter all
Parliaments might continue for seven years. “This,” said Marlborough’s
most brilliant descendant, “was the boldest and most complete assertion
of Parliament’s sovereign ty that England had yet seen.” 13 George I,
also fearful of a Tory victory, approved the new law; in effect the
Hanoverians had to abdicate in order to reign.</p>
<p>To further protect the new dynasty, Stanhope concluded with France
and Holland (1717) a Triple Alliance that ended French support of Jaco-
bite claims, and English support of Spain against France. In 1720 Spain
signed a submissive peace, and George I could sit more securely, during
his seven remaining years, on his alien throne. In 1726 his still
imprisoned wife sent him a bitter letter, challenging him to meet her,
within a year, at the judgment seat of God. Soon afterward she died of
brain fever. Tradition</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>represents a soothsayer as having predicted that George I would not
outlive his wife by a year. In 1727 the King’s health began to fail. In
June he left England to visit his beloved Hanover. Near Osnabriick a
folded paper was thrown into his carriage; it was a dying curse left him
by his wife. Reading it, the King fell into a fit, and on June 1 1 he
died. 14</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>GEORGE II AND QUEEN CAROLINE</li>
</ol>
<p>His son and enemy received the news as an unreasonably delayed act of
justice on the part of Providence. When the Archbishop of Canterbury
presented George Augustus with the late King’s will, he stuffed it into
his pocket, and he never let it be made public. Some said it was
concealed be- cause it proposed to put Hanover and England under
separate heads; others claimed that it left to grandson Frederick Louis,
to mistress or wife the Duchess of Kendal, and to his daughter the Queen
of Prussia substantial sums that would thin the royal purse. 15 History
does not know.</p>
<p>Like his father, George II was a good soldier. At twenty-five he
had</p>
<p>fought valiantly under Eugene and Marlborough at Audenaarde (1708);
at sixty he was to lead his own troops to victory at Dettingen (1743).
Often he carried the manners of the camp into the court, ranting
irascibly; upon h is ministers he lavished such terms as “scoundrels,”
“stinking blockheads,” and “buffoons.” 16 But he worked industriously at
the king trade, spoke Eng - lish correctly though with a thick
Westphalian accent, 17 observed impa- tiently but carefully the limits
placed upon his powers and income by Par- liament, and for thirteen
years firmly supported Robert Walpole in keeping John Bull solvent and
peaceful. Like his father, he retired frequently to Hanover, to the
delight of all concerned. Like his father, he quarreled with the Prince
of Wales, for “it ran a little in the family,” as Horace Walpole put it,
“to hate the eldest son.” 18 Like his father, he took mistresses, if
only to be in the fashion; unlike his father, he dearly loved his
wife.</p>
<p>Caroline, daughter of Margrave John Frederick of Brandenburg- Ans-
bach, had been brought up at the Charlottenburg court of George I’s
sister, Sophia Charlotte, first Queen of Prussia. There she had met
Leibniz, had en- joyed the debates of philosophers, Jesuits, and
Protestant divines, and had developed a scandalous degree of religious
liberalism and tolerance. Charles VI, “Holy Roman” Emperor, offered her
his hand and creed; she refused both, and ma rried ( 1 705 ) George
Augustus, the “little red - faced” 19 Electoral Prince of Hanover; to
him, with all his temper and hers, through all his mishaps and
mistresses, she remained faithful and devoted to the end. George treated
her harshly, and wrote her long letters about his liaisons; but he
respected her mind and character enough to let her rule England
(with</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>Walpole’s help) in his long absences, and to let her guide his
policies when he returned.</p>
<p>After her plump, fresh-colored youth she had no charms of body except
lovely hands, and few graces of manner or speech, to hold her husband;
however, he admired the architecture of her bust, and ordered her to
expose it convincingly . 20 She grew stouter with each pregnancy, her
face was scarred with smallpox, her voice was loud and guttural, she
loved intrigue and power. But gradually the English began to like her
hearty humor; they came to understand what sacrifice she was making of
health and happiness to be a good wife and queen; and the intellect of
England saw with surprise that this blunt Brandenburger had an
appreciative mind and ear for the literature, science, philosophy, and
music of the age.</p>
<p>Her court became almost a salon. There she welcomed Newton, Clarke,
Berkeley, Butler, Pope, Chesterfield, Gay, and Lady Mary Montagu. She
supported Lady Mary’s initiative in vaccination. She saved a daughter of
Milton from poverty; she supported Handel through all the changing moods
of the public and the King. She contributed from her private purse the
means to encourage young and needy talent ; 21 she rescued the heretic
Whiston with a pension; she secured religious liberty for the Scottish
Ja- cobites. She arranged the appointment of Anglican bishops on the
ground of their learning rather than their orthodoxy. She herself was a
deist with a hesitant belief in immortality ; 22 but she thought that
the Established Church should be financed by the government as an aide
to popular morality and calm . 23 “This princess,” said Voltaire, “is
certainly born for the encourage - ment of the arts, and for the good of
the human race. . . . She is an amiable philosopher seated on a throne
.” 24</p>
<p>She had enough philosophy to see, even in her last hour, the humor in
life’s tragedies. Suffering mortally from a rupture that she had long
con - cealed from all but the King, she advised him, then fifty, to
marry again after her death. His answer, since re in his grief, revealed
the time: “Non, f aurai des mattresses 〔No, I will have mistresses〕 .”
“Ah, mon Dieu,“ she ex - claimed, “cela n’empeche pas 〔that will not
interfere〕 !” 25 He mourned her loss with unwonted feeling: “I never
yet saw a woman wor thy to buckle her shoe .” 26 Twenty -three years
later, in pursuance of his will, her coffin in Westminster Abbey was
opened so that his remains might lie by her side.</p>

<li>ROBERT WALPOLE</li>
</ol>
<p>It was through her brave championship, against a pack of
office-seeking, warmongering enemies, that Walpole was able to give
England twenty years of prosperity and peace. He was no saint; he was
probably the most</p>
<p>96 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>corrupt minister that England has ever had, but he was also one of
the best. In that corrupt age only through corruption could wisdom
rule.</p>
<p>As the youngest son of an old Norfolk family, Robert had been
intended for the Church, and at Eton, where he was the contemporary of
his future foe, Bolingbroke, this was the object of his studies. But the
death of his older brothers made him heir to the family fortune; and as
the family controlled three electoral boroughs, he had no trouble in
turning successfully from theology to politics. Aged twenty-five, he
entered the House of Commons as a Whig (1701). His connections, money,
quick intelligence, and mastery of administrative finance won him
appointment as secretary of war (1708). In 1 7 1 2 the victorious Tories
unseated him, and sent him to the Tower on a charge of corruption; but
as the smell of sterling had become so constant and ubiquitous as to
produce olfactory insensibility, he was soon released, soon re-elected,
soon in office as first lord of the treasury (1715). Political
complications led him to resign in 1717. In 1720 the collapse of the
South Sea Company, and the justification of his warnings, convinced even
his ene- mies that he was the man best equipped to lead England back to
financial stability. As again first lord of the treasury (1721), he
stopped the panic, as we have seen, by putting the Bank of England
behind the company’s obli - gations; gradually the entire ^ 7,000,000
owed by it to the public was re- paid. 27 The grateful gamblers rewarded
Walpole with twenty-two years of power.</p>
<p>The accession of George II briefly interrupted Walpole’s ascendancy.
The new King had sworn unforgiving hostility to all who had served his
father; he dismissed Walpole, and asked Sir Spencer Compton to form a
new ministry. But Compton soon displayed and acknowledged the inade-
quacy of his talents; Caroline advised her husband to recall Walpole,
who clinched the argument by promising King and Queen a larger
allowance; Sir Spencer gratefully accepted an earldom, and Walpole
resumed his rule. To him first the title “prime minister” was applied,
originally (as with Christian, Puritan, and Methodist) as a term of
abuse. And he was the first chief minister to make 10 Downing Street his
official home.</p>
<p>His character sheds some light on the art of political success. He
had only a year at university, and was weak in the educational equipment
usual in British prime ministers. There was little elegance in his
manners or his speech. “When he ceased to talk politics,” said Macaulay,
“he could talk of nothing but women, and he dilated on his favorite
theme with a freedom which shocked even that plain- spoken generation.”
28 His son Horace did not hold it against him that he knew few books;
“he knew mankind, not their writings; he consulted their interests, not
their systems.” 29 He had suf - ficient command of Latin to use it as
his medium of communication with George I, for that king knew no
English, and Walpole knew no German or</p>

<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>French. He had all the qualities of John Bull except pugnacity: he
was stout, bluff, hearty, good-natured, practical; he enjoyed dinners
and drink, but would work hard when called upon; and perhaps it was also
like John Bull that he rattled his purse instead of his sword.</p>
<p>He had almost no morals. He lived for years in open adultery, showing
little respect for the suave decorum of aristocratic vice. He jested
with Queen Caroline on her husband’s mistresses; after her death he
advised her daughters to summon these maids of honor to distract the
mind of the grieving King. He laughed at religion. When Caroline was
dying he sent for the Archbishop of Canterbury. “Let this farce be
played,” he proposed; “the Archbishop will d o it very well. You may bid
him be as short as you wish. He will do the Queen no hurt, any more than
any good, and it will satisfy all the wise and good fools, who will call
us atheists if we don’t pre - tend to be as great fools as they are.” 30
He took no stock in noble motives or professions of unselfishness. Like
Marlborough, he used public office to amass private wealth. He found
political plums for his son Horace and other relatives. At a cost of £
200,000 he built a magnificent mansion at his estate of Houghton, and
adorned it with paintings valued by Horace at ^ 40,000; he kept open
house there for the entire county of Norfolk. 31 He was as gen- erous as
John Bull because (if we credit his enemies) he could not clearly
distinguish between Jo hn Bull’s funds and his own.</p>
<p>He used money to buy M.P.s as Richelieu had used it to buy armies, as
Henri Quatre had used it to immobilize foes. Walpole employed it as a
last resort, after all softer arguments had failed. The parliamentary
corrup- tion that had taken form under Charles II had reached the point
where the House of Commons could be managed, for good or evil, only by
massive lubrication. Walpole kept a secret reserve — even a special room
— for the purchase of seats and votes and editors; it was alleged that
he spent £ 50,000 annually in subsidizing periodicals to expound his
point of view. 32 In 1725 he prompted George I to establish the Most
Honorable Order of the Bath, to consist of the sovereign, a grand
master, and thirty-six knights compan- ions; to Walpole, as to Napoleon,
it seemed more economical to rule men with ribbons than with
currency.</p>
<p>He used these corrupt methods to maintain England in prosperity and
calm. His ends did not justify his means, but they revealed the better
side of his character. He was a man of good will, resolved to keep his
country on an even keel despite all the commotions of party politics,
the crosswinds of class interests, the chauvinistic cries for war. It
was his motto, he said, quieta (or tranquilla ) non movere — to let
sleeping dogs lie; and though this left his rule undistinguished by
conquests or reforms, he earned the commendation of the judicious. His
enemies had to admit that he was not vindictive or un- forgiving, and
that he was more trustworthy, even more trusting, in his</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>friendships than could have been expected of one so familiar with the
baser aspects of mankind. 33 He had no far-flung schemes for glory, but
he met each problem, as it arose, with such shrewdness, tolerance, and
tact that England finally forgave him all his faults except his love of
peace.</p>
<p>His economic legislation struck a compromise between the landowning
gentry and the business class. He sought to reduce taxes on land, and
sup- ported extreme penalties for offenses against property. At the same
time he welcomed the rise of capitalism. He favored merchants and
manufacturers with export bounties and import dues, and seemed
insensitive to the poverty of landless laborers in the villages and the
growing proletariat in the towns; he appears to have felt that the
maldistribution of wealth was an inevitable result of nature’s
maldistribution of ability. Excepting those bounties and dues, he
advocated, long before the French physiocrats and Adam Smith, a policy
of free trade; in a single year he reduced the duties on 106 articles of
export, on thirty-eight articles of import; he removed many restraints
on the commerce of the American colonies; and he argued that the English
economy would prosper best under a minimum of state regulation. Time
justified his view; the national wealth grew rapidly, however
ill-distributed; governmental revenues rose; and by handling them with
parsimony and efficiency Walpole won praise as “the best commercial
minister the country</p>
<p>His most spectacular defeat came on his famous excise bill (1733).
The smugglers of tobacco and wine were cheating the treasury of tariff
dues, and burdening property with more than its share of taxes. To
circumvent this form of private enterprise Walpole proposed an excise
tax (a slice “cut out” for the government) to be levied on these
articles wherever stored, and whenever sold, in England. Revenue
officers (“excise men”) were author - ized to search any house at any
time, and persons found hiding dutiable goods were subjected to fines or
imprisonment. Everybody concerned in the importation, smuggling, sale,
or consumption of tobacco or wine rose in protest. Walpole’s opponents
in the Commons denounced the tax, and the manner of its enforcement, as
the arbitrary action of a tyrant, and a monstrous infringement of
British liberty. “The members of Parliament,” as Frederick the Great put
the matter, “told Walpole that he could pay them for their ordinary
mischief, but that this proposal was beyond the limits of their
corruption” 35 — or perhaps they hoped to replace him in control of
public funds. Pamphlets in thousands of copies reviled the minister in
en- thusiastic billingsgate. Crowds surged around Westminster Hall,
burned effigies of Walpole in dozens of bonfires, and tried to lynch him
as he left St. Stephen’s Church; the nation was inflamed to the verge of
revolution. Queen Caroline feared for the loyalty of the army, and
trembled for the safety of the new dynasty. Walpole withdrew the
measure, acknowledging</p>

<p>99</p>
<p>defeat; and from that moment his power declined. His enemies gathered
for the kill.</p>

<p>They were many and diverse. One group, still Jacobite, plotted with
the Old Pretender, and would soon thrill with the romance of young
Bonnie Prince Charlie. One coterie danced around Frederick Louis, Prince
of Wales, foe and heir to the King. Against the minister were the
greatest Eng- lish writers of the age — Swift, Pope, Fielding,
Arbuthnot, Thomson, Aken- side, Gay; they ridiculed his manners, exposed
his morals, censured his poli- cies, and reproached him for
discontinuing that lavish aid to authors which had distinguished the
government under William III and Queen Anne. The Tories, thirsting for
the ichor of office, pulled strings, manipulated poets, and roused the
winds of Parliament in their resolve to replace the ministerial Falstaff
at the national trough. William Pulteney, Chesterfield, and the up-
coming Pitt voiced their cause, and Bolingbroke defended it
unrelentingly with his lethal pen.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke had received a royal pardon in 1723, allowing his return
to England and his estates; but, by Walpole’s influence, he was excluded
from office and Parliament as a man of many treasons and dubious
fidelity. He remained a power none the less. In his town house the
intelligentsia of Eng- land gathered, fascinated by his handsome figure,
his sophisticated wit, and the aura of his name. There and in his
country home he traded barbs with Swift, heresies with Pope, and ballads
with Gay; there he labored to weld hungry Tories and inadequately
lubricated Whigs into a united opposition to Walpole; there he organized
the staff and program of a magazine — called at first (1726) The Country
Gentleman and then The Craftsman — -which struck a blow, week after week
for ten years, at everything that Walpole did or proposed to do.
Bolingbroke himself wrote the most damaging arti- cles, the most
brilliant political prose of the age after the decline of Swift. A
series of nineteen letters (1733-34 ) — ^4 Dissertation upon Parties —
was mockingly dedicated to Walpole. “Till I read 〔them〕,” Chesterfield
wrote to his son, “I did not kn ow all the extent and power of the
English lan- guage.” 36</p>
<p>Bolingbroke’s character was his defeat. His fine manners (which

experiments with men, economics, and states; hence it is the best guide
to the nature of man, and therefore to the interpretation of the present
and the anticipation of the future. “History is philosophy teaching by
examples. . . . We see men at their whole length in history.” 37 We
should “apply ourselves to it in a philosophical spirit,” aiming not
merely to comprehend causes, effects, and uniform sequences, but to
conduct ourselves in ways that have heretofore proved most propitious to
human development and happiness. 38 The diffi- culty in such studies is
that “there are few histories without lies, and none without some
mistakes. . . . The lying spirit has gone forth from ecclesias- tical to
other historians”; 39 but the resolute student, by confronting liar
with</p>
<p>In 1736 Bolingbroke returned to the arena of politics with Letters on
the Spirit of Patriotism, which attacked the corruption of Walpole’s
administra - tion, and called for a new spirit of selfless devotion in
English politics.</p>
<p>Neither Montaigne in writing his Essays, nor Des Cartes in
building</p>
<p>new worlds, nor . . . Newton in discovering and establishing the</p>
<p>true laws of nature on experiment and a sublime geometry, felt more
intellectual joys than he feels who is a real patriot, who bends all the
force of his understanding, and directs all his thoughts and actions, to
the good of his country. 40</p>
<p>His hope turned to the younger generation. Visiting England in 1738,
he cultivated the friendship of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, who
was now leading the oppositio n to Walpole. To Frederick’s private
secretary Boling - broke now addressed his most famous production, The
Idea of a Patriot</p>
<p>King. Frederick died in 1751, but his son, the future George III,
derived from these pages some articles of his political creed. 41
Essentially the essay was a plea for a benevolent monarchy, such as
Voltaire and the philosophes were to dream of in the next generation.
England — Bolingbroke argued — was now so debased that no one could save
it except a king who should rise above faction and party, even above
Parliament, take power into his own hands, repel and punish bribery, and
rule as well as reign. But the pa- triot king would view his power not
as a divine right but as a public trust, not as absolute but as limited
by natural law, the liberties of his subjects, the freedom of the press,
and the customs of the realm: and he would judge all issues according as
they affected the prosperity and happiness of the peo- ple. 42 He would
promote commerce as the chief s ource of a nation’s wealth. He would, in
Britain, strengthen the navy as the guardian of national inde- pendence
and of the Continental balance of power.</p>
<p>The Idea of a Patriot King was an attempt to build, with displaced
Tories and discontented Whigs, a new party of Tories dressed in Whig
principles,</p>

<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>IOI</p>
<p>renouncing Jacobitism, and seeking to reconcile land with commerce,
em- pire with liberty, public service with private wealth.* When the
essay was publisned (1749) it became the rallying cry of young
enthusiasts who, as “the King’s Friends,” looked to the monarchy to
cleanse the government of England. It formed the political philosophy of
Samuel Johnson and both the elder and the younger Pitt. It inspired the
liberal conservatism of Ben- jamin Disraeli, whose Vindication of the
English Constitution (1835) hailed Bolingbroke as the father of Tory
democracy, as the man whose “complete reorganization of the public mind
laid the foundation for the future acces- sion of the Tory party to
power.” 44 It was the Bolingbroke and Disraeli in - fluence that
remolded the defeated Tories into the progressive “Conserva - tives” of
England today.</p>
<p>V. HOW TO GET INTO A WAR</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bolingbroke’s propaganda shared with the bellicose spirit
of a money- minded Parliament in ending Walpole’s long ascendancy.
Basing his tenure on tranquillity preserved, the cautious minister shied
away from for- eign entanglements, agreed with Cardinal Fleury — who was
ruling France on similar principles — to maintain as long as possible
the peace established by the Treaty of Utrecht, and, for the rest, left
the management of external relations to his able brother Horatio. But
the retention of Gibraltar by Eng- land, and the rivalry between England
and Spain for control of America and the seas, begot increasing violence
as the years progressed. Both George I and his minister Stanhope, in
January and June, 1721, had assured Philip V of Spain that England would
give up Gibraltar as soon as the fi- nances of Britain and the temper of
Parliament improved; but the British public refused to countenance such
a surrender. 45 Let us follow now the English account of how England
slipped into war; it will illustrate both the jingoism of the populace
and the integrity of British historians. 46</p>
<p>The South Sea Company, we are told, “grossly abused” the privilege ac
- corded to England by Spain, of sending one trading ship per year to
the Spanish possessions in the New World, an d “a large illicit trade
had sprung up,” partly managed, partly connived at, by the company.
Spain retaliated by boarding English vessels suspected of smuggling.
Robert Jenkins alleged that in one such case (1731) he had lost an ear;
he preserved if, displayed it in Britain, and cried out for revenge. The
Spanish confiscated some Eng- lish ships engaged in licit commerce, and
kept English prisoners in irons; English privateers captured Spaniards
and sold them as slaves in the British</p>

<p>colonies. Smuggling continued; the Spanish government protested; Wal-
pole, reluctant to reduce the income of the struggling South Sea
Company, temporized, though he dealt severely with smuggling along the
English coasts. The English merchant class favored war, confident of
naval superi- ority, secure against invasion, and hopeful of new markets
and expanded trade. The people were excited with factual and fictitious
tales of Spanish brutality; Englishmen who clamored for action were
hailed as manly pa- triots, those who advised moderation were called
lily-livered cowards. Jen- kins showed Parliament his ear in a bottle
(March, 1738), whereupon Pul- teney, Pitt, and others of the opposition
to Walpole made hot speeches about the honor of England.* In martial
counterpoint the Spanish public denounced the English as heretical dogs,
and swallowed a story that an English captain had made a noble Spaniard
cut off and devour his own nose.</p>
<p>Both governments behaved sensibly. La Quadra, Spain’s chief minister,
issued for public consumption a hot letter to Walpole, but privately in-
formed him that Spain would welcome a negotiated settlement. Defying
popular uproar, the British government signed with Spain the Convention
of the Pardo (January 14, 1739), in which both sides made concessions,
and a commission was made to settle all outstanding grievances. Half the
Spanish public accepted the convention; nearly all England rose in anger
against it. The South Sea Company complained that the convention would
severely limit its income and dividends; and the English ambassador at
Madrid was also an agent of the company. Moreover, the Asiento by which
Spain allowed England to supply Negro slaves to Spanish America expired
on May 6, 1739, and Philip V refused to renew the contract. 49
Nevertheless, pursuing his pacific policy, Walpole recalled the British
fleet from the Medi- terranean; then, wrongly suspecting that Spain was
signing a secret alliance with France, he revoked the order, and bade
the fleet protect Gibraltar. La Quadra protested; Walpole, yielding to
the martial mood of Parliament and people, broke off negotiations; and
on October 19, 1739, England de- clared war against Spain. The public,
still calling Walpole a coward, re- joiced, and throughout England
church bells rang. Now James Thomson wrote his stirring ballad “Rule,
Britannia!” pledging that “Britons never will be slaves.”</p>
<p>Normally nothing so strengthens a government as a declaration of war,
for then the loyal opposition muzzles its guns. But Walpol e’s ministry
was an exception. His enemies rightly felt that his heart was not in
marching armies or in squadrons belching fire; they blamed all military
reverses on his mismanagement, and ascribed a naval success at
Portobello (on the Isth-</p>

member of the opposition. In February, 1741, Samuel Sandys proposed to
Parlia- ment that the King be advised to dismiss his chief minister. The
motion was defeated, but only by Walpole’s solicitation of Jacobite
votes. He survived another year; nevertheless he realized that his time
was up, and that the country wanted a change.</p>
<p>And he was exhausted. “He who in former years,” his son wrote, “was
asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow . . . now never sleeps
above an hour without waking; and he who at dinner always forgot that he
was minister, and was more gay and thoughtless than all his company, now
sits without speaking, and with his eyes fixe d, for an hour together.”
50 New elections returned a Parliament overwhelmingly hostile; it
defeated him in a minor matter, and on February 13, 1742, he resigned.
Too old to face the tumult of the Commons, he easily persuaded George II
to make him Earl of Orford, and as such he sank upward into the House of
Lords. He had feathered his nest for his fall.</p>
<p>He died, after suffering stoically a long and painful illness, on
March 1 8, 1745, aged sixty-eight. England bade goodbye to peace, and
set out, with Pitt after Pitt, to conquer the world.</p>

<li>Ireland: 1714-56</li>
</ol>
<p>Rarely in history has a nation been so oppressed as the Irish.
Through repeated victories by English armies over native revolts, a code
of laws had been set up that chained the Irish in body and soul. Their
soil had been confiscated until only a handful of Catholic landowners
remained, and nearly all of it was held by Protestants who treated their
agricultural labor- ers as slaves. “The poor people in Ireland,” said
Chesterfield, “are used worse than Negroes by their lords and masters.”
51 It was “not unusual in Ireland,” said Lecky, “for great landed
proprietors to have regular prisons in their houses for the summa ry
punishment of the lower orders.” 52 Many of the landlords lived in
England, and spent there (Swift estimated) a third of the rents paid by
Irish tenants. 53 The tenants — racked by rents paid to the landlord, by
tithes paid to the Established Church which they hated, and by dues paid
to their, own priests — lived in mud hovels with leaky roofs, went half
naked, and were often on the edge of starvation; Swift thought “the
Irish tenants live worse than English beggars.” 54 Those landlords who
remained in Ireland, and the deputies of the absentees, drugged
themselves against the barbarism and hostility of their surroundings
with carousals of food and drink, extravagant hospitality, quarreling
and dueling, and gam- bling for high stakes.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Having full power over Ireland, the British Parliament stifled any
Irish industry that competed with England. We have seen elsewhere how an
act of 1699 destroyed the nascent wool manufactures by forbidding the
export of Irish woolens to any country whatever. In like manner such
foreign com- merce as Ireland had preserved amid political turmoil and
military devasta- tion was mercilessly throttled by English laws. Irish
exports were saddled with export duties that cut them off from nearly
all markets but England. 55 Many Irish had lived by raising cattle and
exporting them to England; laws of 1665 and 1680 forbade the English
importation of Irish cattle, sheep, or swine, of beef, mutton, bacon, or
pork, even of butter or cheese. Ireland had exported her products to the
English colonies; an act of 1663 required that, with a few exceptions,
no European articles could be imported into English colonies except from
England in English ships manned by English- men. The Irish merchant
marine died. Said Swift: “The conveniency of ports and harbors, which
nature bestowed so liberally on this kingdom, is of no more use to us
than a beautiful prospect to a man shut up in a dungeon.” 56</p>
<p>Protestants as well as Catholics we re harassed by England’s
legislation for her Irish subjects; and in one famous instance they
joined the Catholics in overruling the British government. The export of
money as rent to absentee landlords had by 1722 created a shortage of
metal currency in Ireland. Walpole offered to relieve this by an issue
of copper coins. The plan was reasonable, but was spotted with the usual
corruption: the Duchess of Kendal was granted a patent to mint the new
coinage; she sold it to Wil- liam Wood, ironmaster, for £ 10,000; and to
raise this sum plus his profit Wood proposed to coin £ 100,800 in
halfpennies or farthings. As the total metal currency of Ireland was
then only ,£400,000, the Irish protested that coppers would have to be
used in payments as well as making change; that foreign accounts,
including the rents of absentee landlords, would have to be paid in
silver or bank notes; that the cheaper coins would drive the better ones
into hoarding or export; and that soon Ireland would have nothing but
troublesome coppers as its currency. To meet these complaints . the
British government agreed to reduce the new issue to ,£40,000, and it
presented a report from Isaac Newton, master of the Mint, that Wood’s
halfpennies were quite as good in metallic content as the patent
required, and much better than the coins inherited from earlier
reigns.</p>
<p>At this juncture Jonathan Swift, Anglican dean of St. Patrick’s
Cathedral</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>were worth far less than their face value; and, indeed, some
economists con- firmed his claim by calculating that Ireland would
sustain a loss of £ 60,480 by the issue as first proposed. 57 In the
fourth letter Swift advanced to a pow- erful indictment of all English
rule in Ireland, and laid down the principle that “all government
without the consent of the governed is the very defini - tion of
slavery.” 58 The Irish, including the majority of Protestants among
them, responded eagerly to this bold note; ballads urging resistance to
Eng- land were sung in the streets; and the English government, which
had for centuries defied an entire people, now found itself in retreat
before a single pen. It offered a reward of three hundred pounds for the
apprehension of the author, but though hundreds knew that this was the
gloomy Dean, no one dared take action against him. Nor would any
Irishman face the anger of the people by accepting the new coins.
Walpole acknowledged defeat, canceled the issue, and allowed Wood £
24,000 compensation for his futile expenses and his vanished gains.</p>
<p>The structure of Irish politics made impossible any resistance to
English domination except by mob action or individual violence. Since no
one could hold office except by adherence to the Church of England, the
Irish Parlia- ment, after 1692, was composed entirely of Protestants, 59
and was now wholly subservient to England. In 1719 the English
Parliament reaffirmed its paramount right to legislate for Ireland. Laws
that in England protected parliamentary or individual liberty, like the
Habeas Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights, were not extended to Ireland;
the relative freedom of the press en- joyed in England had no existence
in Ireland. The two parliaments resem- bled each other only in the
corruption of their electors and their members. They differed again in
the dominant influence of Anglican bishops in the Irish House of
Lords.</p>
<p>The Established Church in Ireland included about a seventh of the
popu- lation among its adherents, but it was supported by tithes taken
from the peasantry, nearly all of whom were Catholics. A small
proportion of the people followed the Presbyterian or other Dissenting
creeds, and received a measure of toleration, short of eligibility to
office. Catholics were excluded not only from office but from all the
learned professions except medicine, and from nearly every avenue to
higher education, wealth, or influence. 60 They were forbidden to
purchase land, or to invest in mortgages on land, or to hold any long or
valuable lease. They could not serve as jurors, except where Protestants
were not available. They could not teach in schools; they could not vote
for municipal or national offices; they could not validly marry a
Protestant. 61 Their religious worship was permitted, if celebrated by a
priest who had registered with the government and had taken the Oath of
Abjuration disclaiming allegiance to the Stuart line; other priests were
liable to imprisonment, but this law was seldom enforced after 1725; in
1732a</p>
<p>10 6 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>committee of the Irish Parliament reported that there were 1,445
priests in Ireland, 229 Catholic churches, 549 Catholic schools. After
1753 the zeal of the English abated, and the condition of the Catholics
in Ireland improved.</p>
<p>The disorder of religious life shared with the poverty of the people
and the hopelessness of social advancement in demoralizing Irish life.
The ablest and bravest Catholics — who would have raised the level of
Irish capacity, moral- ity, and intelligence — emigrated to France or
Spain or America. Many Irish- men sank into beggary or crime as an
escape from starvation. Robber gangs hid in the countryside, smugglers
and wreckers lurked near the shores, and some property owners kept as
many as eighty bravos to do their bidding re- gardless of the law.
Thousands of cattle and sheep were slaughtered by rov- ing bands,
apparently as acts of Catholic revenge upon Protestant landlords. It was
difficult for a people to respect the laws passed by an Irish Parliament
that often spoke of the Catholics — three quarters of the population —
as “the common enemy.”</p>
<p>There were some brighter elements in Irish life. The cheerful,
easygoing, laughter-loving temper of the people survived through all
their hardships; and their superstitions and legends surrounded their
lives with magic and poetry without leading them to such violence as
marked the witchcraft perse- cutions in Scotland and Germany. The
Anglican clergy in Ireland included some fine scholars (e.g., Bishop
Ussher of Armagh), a prominent philosopher (George Berkeley, bishop of
Cloyne), and the greatest writer of English in the first quarter of the
eighteenth century, Jonathan Swift, dean of St. Pat- rick’s Cathedral.
The Dublin Society, founded in 1731, labored to improve technology in
agriculture and industry, to stimulate invention, and to en- courage
art. There were many cases of individual Protestants helping in- digent
Catholics, and of magistrates applying leniently the Draconian regula-
tions of the penal code.</p>
<p>But by and large the Irish scene was one of the most shameful in
history. A degrading poverty, a chaotic lawlessness, a nomadic
pauperism, 34,000 beg- gars, countless thieves, an upper class living in
drunken extravagance amid a starving peasantry, every crop failure
bringing widespread starvation — “the old and sick,” said Swift, “dying
and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin” 62 — this terrible
picture must find a place in our conception of man. After the long and
bitter frost of 1 7 39 came the desperate famine of 1 740-41 , in which,
by one estimate, twenty per cent of the population perished, leav- ing
many deserted villages. In the county of Kerry the number of taxpayers
fell from 14,346 in 1733 to 9,372 in 1744. Berkeley calculated that “the
na - tion probably will not recover this loss in a century.” 63 He was
wrong. Pa - tiently the women bore children to replace the dead.
Religious ardor de- clined among the Protestants as education spread; it
increased among the Catholics as their religion identified itself with
the struggle of the nation for</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>freedom. The high birth rate favored by the Catholic Church, as her
secret weapon against all opposition, soon countervailed the
depredations of famine, pestilence, and war; by 1750 the population of
Ireland had risen from ap- proximately 2,000,000 in 1700 to some
2,370,000. In the long run the faith and fertility of the oppressed
overcame the arms and greed of the conquerors.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>SCOTLAND: 1714-56</li>
</ol>
<p>Why was the fate of Scotland so different from that of Ireland?</p>
<p>First of all, Scotland had never been conquered; on the contrary, it
had given the English a Scottish king. Its Highland chieftains, still
unsubdued, provided a fighting class that had led the Scots again and
again in invasions of England. Its Lowland stock was Anglo-Saxon,
basically of the same breed as the English. Its soil remained in
resolute native hands. Its religion, like the Anglican, was a product of
the Reformation, not a heritage from the medie- val Church; and it
united instead of dividing the nation. After the Act of Union ( 1 707) ,
Scotland shared in proportion to population in electing mem- bers of the
now British — i.e., English- Welsh-Scottish — Parliament; it submit- ted
to be ruled from London, but only after extorting commercial conces-
sions that enriched the Scottish people. Every parish in Scotland tried
to set up a school for its children, and four universities offered the
best higher edu- cation then available in the British Isles. In the
course of the eighteenth cen- tury this educational activity flowered
into a “Scottish Enlightenment”— Hume, Hutcheson, Reid, Robertson, Adam
Smith — that gave a heady pace to the English mind.</p>
<p>That bright fulfillment, however, had to be earned; fifty years
passed be- fore the fruits of the union matured. Scotland in 1714 was
still basically feudal: each district, outside the cities, was ruled by
a great noble through his vassal lairds, and the land was worked by a
loyal and letterless tenant peas- antry. But now the political union
with England was rapidly undermining that structure. The nobles had
dominated the Scottish Parliament; when that Parliament was ended the
Scottish representatives in the British Parliament found themselves in
an environment where the influence of trade and indus- try rivaled that
of land; they adopted English ideas and technology; and by 1750 the
manufacturers and merchants of Scotland were challenging the national
leadership of the Argylls, the Atholls, the Hamiltons, and the Mars. The
Jacobite adventure of 1 745 was the last flare of Scottish feudal power;
when it failed, the economic life of Scotland merged with the English
econ- omy, and the rule of the middle classes began. The union opened
the English colonies to Scottish trade; in 1718 Glasgow launched the
first Scottish vessel to cross the Atlantic; soon Scottish merchants
were everywhere. Agricultural</p>

<p>technology and urban sanitation improved; the death rate fell;
population rose from 1,000,000 in 1700 to 1,652,000 at the close of the
century. Edin- burgh, with fifty thousand inhabitants, was in 1751 the
third-largest city in Great Britain, surpassed only by London and
Bristol.</p>
<p>The Presbyterian Kirk remained almost fanatically loyal to the
Calvinist theology . Every Sunday the people walked — sometimes two or
three miles — to churches sternly bare of ornament, and heard hours of
preaching and prayer emphasizing the fatality of predestination and the
terrors of hell. The Bible was the daily inspiration of every Scottish
family; as late as 1 763 Hume, in wry exaggeration, estimated two Bibles
in Scotland to every man, woman, and child. 64 The preachers were men of
little education but of sincere and moving piety; they lived in austere
simplicity, and their example and precepts contributed forcefulness to
the stability and integrity of the Scottish charac- ter. The elders and
minister of each kirk watched sharply over the conduct and speech of the
parishioners; they meted out penalties for swearing, slan- der,
quarreling, witchcraft, fornication, adultery, any breach of the
Sabbath, any deviation from their awful creed. The ministers condemned
dancing, wedding festivities, and attendance at the theater. They still
held trials for witchcraft, though executions for it were becoming rare.
In 1727 a mother and daughter were convicted on such a charge; the
daughter escaped, but the mother was burned to death in a barrel of
pitch. 65 When the British Parlia- ment (1736) repealed the law
punishing witchcraft with death, the Scottish Presbytery denounced the
repeal as violating the Bible’s express command. 66</p>
<p>Meanwhile the parish schools maintained by the Kirk, and the “burg
schools” supported by the towns, prepared students for the universities.
To Edinburgh, Aberdeen, St. Andrews, and Glasgow came eager young men
from every class — from farms and workshops as well as from lairds’
mansions and baronial halls. A zeal for knowledge animated them, and
they bore any hardship in their quest. Many of them lived in cold attic
rooms, and took their chief nourishment from a sack of oatmeal
periodically carried in from the paternal farm. The professors too were
stoics, rarely receiving over sixty pounds a year. In the universities
hardly less than in the parish schools, the- ology was the core of the
curriculum; but the classics were taught, and a little science; and the
Scottish mind was touched by the secular thought of Europe. Francis
Hutcheson, who held the chair of moral philosophy at Glasgow (1729-46),
put aside dogmatic discussions, and based his ethics on natural grounds.
Students and professors alike became tinged with the Arian heresy — that
Christ, though divine, was not coequal or coeternal with God the Father.
A Scottish author in 1714 mentione d “the great vogue, among our young
gentry and students,” of Hobbes and Spinoza. 67 Little coteries of
youngsters intoxicated with emancipation formed clubs — the “Sulfur So -
ciety,” the “Hell - fire,” the “Demirip Dragoons”— proudly preaching

<p>ism; 88 probably they mingled with Jacobite malcontents. For
Scotland, out- side of those merchant classes that were tied to the
English economy, still thrilled to the memory of the Stuarts, and
dreamed of the time when James III, or his son, would lead the Scots
again across the border to restore a Scottish dynasty to the British
throne.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE: 1 745</li>
</ol>
<p>James III had exhausted himself in futile attempts to lead an
expedition into England or Scotland. In 1 7 19 he married Maria
Clementina Sobieska, grand- daughter of Poland’s most famous king. It
was an unhappy marriage, but it gave James a son whose lovely face and
lively temper — going back perhaps to Mary Queen of Scots — were the
pride and problem of his parents. Eng- land called Charles Edward Stuart
“the Young Pretender”; Scotland called him “Bonnie Prince Charlie.”
Brought up in a discordant household, taught conflicting faiths by his
Catholic and Protestant tutors, Charles grew up with an indifferent
education, but with all the charms of athletic youth and all the ardor
of a head itching for a crown. The Duke of Liria was thrilled by the
lad’s “great beauty,” his merry brown eyes and light -brown hair; a bold
rider, a good shot, a body six feet tall and made for war, a “mighty
golfer,” an accomplished musician, a graceful dancer— this, said the
Duke, “is altogether the most ideal prince I have ever met.” 89 Charles
was con - scious of his virtues, which made him now and then
unmanageable. In 1734, still a boy of fourteen, he was allowed to sample
war in the Spanish army at Gaeta; aroused by this baptism of fire, he
could hardly wait for an oppor- tunity to take England.</p>
<p>It seemed at hand when the British Parliament, overruling Walpole,
opened hostilities with Spain (1739). Frederick the Great’s attack on
Silesia (1740) swelled into the War of the Austrian Succession; England
sent its main army to the Continent; what better time could the
Jacobites find to make another dash for the English throne? In Scotland
they formed “the Association” (1739) pledged to that enterprise; they
sent emissaries to England to stir up a Stuart revolution; they
dispatched appeals to France for money, arms, and troops. Louis XV
ordered seven ships of war and twenty-one troop transports to assemble
at Brest and prepare to convey ten thousand men under Marechal de Saxe
from Dunkirk to England. In Italy Prince Charles anx- iously awaited an
invitation from Paris to join the expedition. No invitation came, but he
left Rome on January 10, 1744, rode day and night to Frascati, Lerici,
and Genoa, took ship to Antibes, and drove on madly to Paris. His aging
father remained in Rome, and never saw him again. Charles was well
received, and moderately financed, by the King. He went on to
Gravelines,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>I IO</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>and waited impatiently for orders to sail with Marechal de Saxe, who
waited impatiently for the French fleet.</p>
<p>The winds and waves, as usual, declared for England. The French
fleet, sailing from Brest (February 6), ran into a “mer affreuse,” a
frightful sea, and “tonjours un vent” always a contrary wind. Ships
collided, masts broke, all was in chaos when word came that an English
squadron of fifty-two ships was approaching. The French fled back to
Brest, but many of their vessels were lost, and the rest were badly hurt
by the gale. With this discouraging news word reached France that the
English Jacobites were disorganized and spiritless, and that no help
could be expected from them if the French came. Louis informed Saxe that
the invasion scheme must be abandoned. England, not yet formally at war
with France, complained that the presence of Charles on French soil was
a breach of treaty commitments. Charles, disguised, hid in Paris, vowing
to his friends that he would invade England even if he had to go alone
in an open boat. His father sent him a plea to avoid precipitate action,
“which would end in your ruin, and that of all those who would join with
you in it.” 70 Meanwhile Charles’ supporters intrigued against one an -
other for influence and perquisities, and denounced one another to him,
until he wrote in despair, “I am plagued out of my life” (November 1 6,
1744). 71</p>
<p>Finally, despite all warnings, and without consulting the French
court, he decided to “tempt my destiny” and “conquer or die.” He sent
agents to Scot - land to rouse the clans; these were so little prepared
that they thought of for- bidding him to come. The English Jacobites,
following Bolingbroke’s lead, were seeking reconciliation with George
II. Nevertheless Charles borrowed</p>
<p>1 80.000 livres, accepted the offer of two armed vessels, and sailed
for Scot- land (July 15, 1745). Near Land’s End the little convoy was
met by a Brit - ish man-of- war; one of Charles’s ships was so damaged
that it returned to Brest. In the other he passed north to the west of
England, and on August 3 he touched Scottish soil at Eriska, in the
Outer Hebrides. A clan leader ad- vised him to go home. “I am come
home,” answered the Prince. He was warned that on August 1 the British
government had proclaimed a reward of</p>
<p>30.000 pounds to anyone who would bring him captive, alive or dead.
Charles replied by dismissing the ship that had brought him, so cutting
off his own retreat. On August 19 he raised his standard at Glenfinnan
in the Highlands, and called all Jacobites to his aid.</p>
<p>Most clan leaders remained aloof; some professed followers plotted to
be- tray him; half a dozen lords declared for him; of his two thousand
men twelve hundred were Macdonalds and Camerons. Eluding government
forces under Sir John Cope, Charles led his band south. On September 17
they entered Edinburgh, seized the guardhouse and the gates, and
established their leader in the once royal palace of Holyrood, where
Mary Stuart had argued with John Knox, and James VI and I had forgotten
his mother. The</p>

<p>Prince, twenty-five years old, made an alluring picture in his
Highland habit, with red velvet breeches, green velvet bonnet, and white
cockade. Many a Scot, thinking that national glory had returned in this
handsome reincarna- tion, knelt and kissed his hand, and all the ladies
prayed and longed for him. He had hardly time to savor his reception
when he learned that Cope was nearing Edinburgh with two thousand
troops. On September 2 1 Charles led out his now three thousand men, met
Cope’s ar my at Prestonpans, routed it, took many captives, treated them
humanely, and returned to Holyrood anointed with victory. Scotland
seemed won.</p>
<p>At ease for a month, Charles requisitioned food and clothing for his
sol- diers, and welcomed the adhesion of additional clans. Louis XV sent
him money and arms from France. On November 8 the happy Prince, on foot,
crossed into England with 4,500 men; he besieged and captured Carlisle;
he was welcomed in Manchester; he pressed on to Derby, hoping by his
dra- matic advance to rouse England to receive him as its legitimate
king. He issued a proclamation vowing that Anglicans and Presbyterians
should suf- fer no more hurt from him, a Roman Catholic, than they had
received from George I, a Lutheran. 72 England did not believe him, and
did not propose to begin anew the weary struggle of the younger faith
against the old. Though hardly anyone in England rose against Charles,
only a handful of English re- cruits came to his aid. The English
Jacobites played safe.</p>
<p>George II had hastened back from Hanover to protect his threatened
throne, and had ordered three English armies to converge at Derby.
Charles was all for ignoring them and rushing on to London with his six
thousand men, but his Scottish chieftains refused to follow him. They
pointed out that each of the government armies was ten thousand strong,
that these, in his rear, would harass and soon overwhelm him, and that
the Jacobite rising which he had promised them was nowhere to be seen;
they insisted on return- ing to Scotland, where they might raise more
clans, and might receive rein- forcements from France. Charles yielded,
and led the sad retreat from Derby to Glasgow. At nearby Falkirk, with
nine thousand men, he defeated an Eng- lish force of ten thousand under
Hawley (January 17, 1746). But it was a Pyrrhic victory. His army was
weakened with losses and desertions; its sup- plies were running out; it
was paid in oatmeal; its leaders were quarreling like clans. Again they
advised retreat. The Prince pleaded for a stand; he saw nothing but
disintegration and ruin in further retreat; why should they run away
from an enemy no stronger than that which they had defeated? Again he
yielded; but now he knew that he was beaten. The Scottish army turned
back toward the Highlands. The pessimism of its leaders swept through
the ranks; desertions ran into thousands; what remained was not so much
an army as an undisciplined and disheartened crowd.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the main English force, under the Duke of Cumberland,
en-</p>
<p>I 12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>tered Scotland, took control of the eastern coast, and received at
Leith a reinforcement of five hundred Hessians brought by George II from
Austria. With 8,800 men Cumberland marched north into Inverness county.
There on Culloden Moor, April 16, 1746, Charles faced him with seven
thousand men poorly armed, poorly fed, poorly led. They fought with
Scottish courage, but they were shattered by Cumberland’s superior
artillery firing grapeshot — “bags of balls” (said a Scottish poet) that
“hewed them down, aye, score by score, as grass does fall before the
mower.” 73 Charles rode about wildly, seeking to rally his retreating
men, but they took to precipi- tate and individual flight. His aides
forced him to withdraw from the battle- field by seizing the bridle of
his horse. His spirit broken, he fled with a few friends, and wandered
in hiding from one refuge to another, repeating, with glory departed,
the tale of Charles II. At last (September 20) he found a vessel that
took him back to France.</p>
<p>Cumberland pursued his routed foes with orders of “No quarter”:

<p>The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) between England and France re-
quired the expulsion of Charles from French soil. He refused to obey; he
was forcibly evicted by French troops; he returned in disguise to Paris,
even, in 1750, to London, seeking in vain to revive the Jacobite cause,
prom- ising in vain to abjure the Catholic faith. 76 Finally admitting
defeat, he fell into such drunkenness and debauchery that all the major
Catholic powers repudiated him. He died in Rome in 1788, aged
sixty-eight. Voltaire, thirty years before, had already written a just
epitaph upon the second Jacobite revolt:</p>

<p>THE RULERS</p>

<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE RISE OF WILLIAM PITT: 1708-56</li>
</ol>
<p>The fall of Walpole bequeathed England to a succession of minor
minis- tries that floundered in political chaos and inconclusive wars.
Lord Wil- mington, as first lord of the treasury (1742-43), ruled at
home while George II fought with theatrical but real heroism at
Dettingen (June 27,</p>
<p>1743). “During all the battle,” wrote Frederick the Great, “the King
of England kept himself at the head of his Hanoverian battalion, his
left foot behind, sword in hand and arm outstretched, very much like a
master of fencing”; 78 just the same he inspired his men by his bravery,
while he mod - estly accepted the commands of his generals. The ministry
of Henry Pel- ham (1743-54) l e d England back to peace, but it
continued the technique of ruling by the purchase of votes in boroughs
and Parliament. His brother, the Duke of Newcastle, kept a tariff of
England’s politicians, on which, for budgetary convenience, he listed
the current market price of each man’s soul. 79 The most lasting
distinction of these two ministries is that they in- cluded the man who
made the British Empire, and who stood out in his turbulent time as one
of the most powerful characters in history.</p>
<p>William Pitt was born (1708) to money because his grandfather, Thomas
Pitt, had made a vast fortune in India. Thomas himself was a man to be
reckoned with. He took service as a sailor in a merchant vessel, settled
in Bengal, and engaged in trade in “illicit” competition with the East
India Company, to which Parliament had granted a monopoly. He was fined
£ 1,000, continued to compete, brought the company to terms, joined it,
and was for twelve years governor of Madras. By 1701 he was a man of
sterling, rich enough to buy the famous “Pitt diamond” for £ 20,000, and
clever enough to sell it to Philippe d’Orleans, Regent of France, for £
1 35, - 000; now valued at ,£480,000, it is preserved among the state
jewels of France in the Louvre as a brilliant witness to the
depreciation of currencies. Thomas invested his gains in English realty,
bought a seat in Parliament, and represented there, from 1710 to 1715,
the “rotten borough” of Old Sarum. He devised his estate to Robert Pitt,
his eldest son, who married Harriet Villiers, who gave him seven
children, of whom William Pitt was the sec- ond son.</p>
<p>At Eton William protested against the discipline; he thought the
fagging would break the spirit of the students; it did not break his. At
Oxford he distinguished himself by suffering from gout at the age of
eighteen. Hoping to shake off the ailment in a warmer climate, he left
the university without a degree and traveled in France and Italy, but
gout remained his cross through all his victories. Nevertheless he
joined the army, served in it for four years, saw no battle, but came
out with the conviction that war is the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>1 14</p>
<p>arbiter of history and the destiny of states. In 1735 his family,
while keep- ing him relatively poor as a younger son, bought Old Sarum’s
votes for him, and he began his career in Parliament.</p>
<p>He soon made himself heard there, for he was the most effective
orator that that forensic cavern has ever known. All the force of his
passionate character went into his speeches, all his resolve to rise to
power, to unseat Walpole, to dominate Parliament and the King, finally
to remake Europe to his heart’s desire. For those purposes he used
logic, drama, imagina tion, enthusiasm, poetry, bombast, invective,
sarcasm, satire, appeals to patriot- ism, to personal and national
interest and glory. As the years progressed he developed his oratorical
mastery until it embraced all the arts of a Demos- thenes or a Cicero.
He could lower his voice to a whisper, or raise it to an angry roar; he
could sink an enemy with a phrase. He followed Demos- thenes’ rule and
made action the life of speech; every line had its gesture, every
feeling molded his hawklike face and glowed in his deep-set eyes, until
his whole body came into play as if the word had been made flesh. He was
the greatest actor that ever shunned the stage.</p>
<p>He was no saint. Ambition was the mast of his character and the wind
in his sails; but it redeemed itself by embracing all England, and
consumed itself in dragging England, willy-nilly, out over imperial seas
to world supremacy. Feeling himself to be the voice of the state, beyond
any Han- overian gutturals or Walpolian bribes, he appropriated the
ethic of gov- ernments — that all is good that advantages the state; if
he used deception, calumny, intimidation, intrigue, ingratitude,
perjury, treachery, these were tools of the statesman’s trade, and were
to be judged not by preachers but by kings. At nearly every step in his
rise he turned his back upon a position that he had recently defended
with all the sublimity of moral passion; 80 he seldom stopped to explain
or apologize; he mounted all intent toward his goal; and his success —
which was England’s— sanctified his sins and haloed his head. Meanwhile
there was something grand in his pride; he disdained to buy advancement
with servility, he remained incorruptible amid corrup- tion, and he
attained his ends by the force of an uncompromising personal- ity that
would not be deterred.</p>
<p>He pursued Walpole as a peacemongering merchant too chicken-livered
to risk war with Spain, and too subservient to a king who, said Pitt,
showed an “absurd, ungrateful, and perfidious partiality for Hanover,”
and “con - sidered England only as a province to a despicable
electorate.” 81 The ardent orator pursued his martial policy with such
intensity that the Duchess of Marlborough, dying in 1744, left Pitt a
legacy of ten thousand pounds, for Sarah had inherited her dead Duke’s
love of war. When Pelham came to office he asked the King to make Pitt
secretary of war; George II, still burning with Pitt’s fire, refused.
Pelham persisted; he described Pitt as</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE RULERS</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>“the most able and useful man we have amongst us, truly honorable and
strictly honest.” 82 The King yielded, and in 1 746 Pitt entered the
ministry, first as joint vice-treasurer for Ireland, then as paymaster
of the forces. This position had become by custom a mine of personal
wealth: the paymaster took for himself one half of one per cent of all
subsidies voted by Parlia- ment to foreign princes; and he invested at
interest — which he kept for him- self — the large floating balance left
with him for the payment of’ troops. Pitt refused to take anything more
than his official salary; when the King of Sardinia pressed him to
accept a gift equal to the usual deduction from his subsidy he declined
it. England, which had long accounted such perquisites as a normal
accommodation to the nature of man, applauded Pitt’s anoma - lous
integrity, and listened with eagerness to his pleas for a Britain that
would bestride the world.</p>
<p>In June, 1755, without a declaration of war, hostilities between
England and France broke out in America. In January, 1756, England
signed a treaty with Prussia. In May France concluded a defensive
alliance with Austria. In November Pitt, now secretary of state, became
England’s voice and arm in that Seven Years’ War that would determine
the map of Europe till the French Revolution.</p>
