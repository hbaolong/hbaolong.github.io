<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>Etruscan Prelude</p>
<p>800-508 B.C.</p>
<p>I. ITALY</p>
<p>e UIET hamlets in the mountain valleys, spacious pastures on the
slopes, lakes upheld in the chalice of the hills, fields green or yellow
verging toward blue seas, villages and towns drowsy under the noon sun
and then alive with passion, cities in which, amid dust and dirt,
everything from cot- tage to cathedral seems beautiful — this for two
thousand years has been Italy. “Throughout the whole earth, and wherever
the vault of heaven spreads, there is no country so fair”: thus even the
pro saic elder Pliny spoke of his fatherland . 1 “Here is eternal
spring,” sang Virgil, “and summer even in months not her own. Twice in
the year the cattle breed, twice the trees serve us with fruit.” 2 Twice
a year the roses bloomed at Paestum, and in th e north lay many a
fertile plain like Mantua’s, “feeding the white swans with grassy
stream.” 3 Like a spine along the great peninsula ran the Apen - nines,
shielding the west coast from the northeast winds, and blessing the soil
with rivers that hurried to lose themselves in captivating bays. On the
north the Alps stood guard; on every other side protecting waters lapped
difficult and often precipitous shores. It was a land well suited to
reward an industri- ous population, and strategically placed athwart the
Mediterranean to rule the classic world.</p>
<p>The mountains brought death as well as splendor, for earthquakes and
eruptions now and then embalmed the labor of centuries in ashes. But
here, as usually, death was a gift to life; the lava mingled with
organic matter to enrich the earth for a hundred generations . 4 Part of
the terrain was too steep for cultivation, and part of it was malarial
marsh; the rest was so fertile that Polybius marveled at the abundance
and cheapness of food in ancient Italy,® and suggested that the quantity
and quality of its crops might be judged from the vigor and courage of
its men. Alfieri thought that the “man - plant” had flourished better in
Italy than anywhere else . 0 Even today the timid student is a bit
frightened by the intense feelings of these fascinating folk — their
taut muscles, swift love and anger, smoldering or blazing eyes; the
pride and fury that made Italy great, and tore her to pieces, in the
days of Marius and Caesar</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. I</p>
<p>and the Renaissance, still run in Italian blood, only awaiting a good
cause or argument. Nearly all the men are virile and handsome, nearly
all the women beautiful, strong, and brave; what land can match the
dynasty of genius that the mothers of Italy have poured forth through
thirty centuries? No other country has been so long the hub of history —
at first in government, then in religion, then in art. For seventeen
hundred years, from Cato Censor to Michelangelo, Rome was the center of
the Western world.</p>
<p>“Those who are the best judges in that country,” says Aristotle,
“report that when Italus became king of Oenotria, the people changed
their name, and called themselves no longer Oenotrians but Italians.” 7
Oenotria was the toe of the I talian boot, so teeming with grapes that
the word meant “land of wine.” Italus, says Thucydides, was a king of
the Sicels, who had occupied Oenotria on the way to conquer and name
Sicily. 8 Just as the Romans called all Hellenes Graeci, Greeks, from a
few Graii who had emigrated from north Attica to Naples, so the Greeks
gradually extended the name Italia to all the peninsula south of the
Po.</p>
<p>Doubtless many chapters of Italy’s story lie silent under her crowded
soil. Remains of an Old Stone Age culture indicate that for at least
30,000 years before Christ the plains were inhabited by man. Between
10,000 and 6000 b.c. a neolithic culture appeared: a longheaded race
called by ancient tradi- tion Liguri and Siceli fashioned rude pottery
with linear ornament, made tools and weapons of polished stone,
domesticated animals, hunted and fished, and buried their dead. Some
lived in caves, others in round huts of wattle and daub; from these
cylindrical cottages architecture pursued a continuous developme nt to
the round “House of Romulus” on the Palatine, the Temple of Vesta in the
Forum, and the Mausoleum of Hadrian — the Castel Sant’ Angelo of
today.</p>
<p>About 2000 b.c. northern Italy was invaded — presumably not for the
first time — by tribes from central Europe. They brought with them the
custom of building their villages upon piles sunk in water, for safety
from animal or human attack. They settled on Garda, Como, Maggiore, and
the other en- chanted lakes that still lure aliens to Italy. Later they
moved south and, find- ing fewer lakes, built their homes upon land, but
still upon a foundation of piles. Their habit of surrounding these
settlements with rampart and moat passed down to form features of Roman
camps and medieval chateaux. They pastured flocks and herds, tilled the
soil, wove clothing, fired pottery; and out of bronze, which had
appeared in Italy toward the end of the Neo- lithic Age (about 2500
b.c.), they forged a hundred varieties of tools and weapons, including
combs, hairpins, razors, tweezers, and other timeless im- plements.®
They allowed their rubbish to accumulate so lavishly around the</p>
<p>CHAP. I) ETRUSCAN PRELUDE 5</p>
<p>villages that their culture has received the name of terramare —
earth marl — from the fertilizing potency of these remains. So far as we
know, they were the direct ancestors of the basic population of Italy in
historical times.</p>
<p>In the valley of the Po the descendants of these terramaricoli, about
1000 b.c., learned from Germany the use of iron, made from it improved
imple- ments, and, so armed, spread their “Villanovan” culture from its
center at Villanova, near Bologna, far down into Italy. From them, we
may believe, came the blood, languages, and essential arts of the
Umbrians, Sabines, and Latins. Then, about 800 b.c., a new flood of
immigrants arrived, subjugated the Villanovan population, and
established between the Tiber and the Alps one of the strangest
civilizations in the records of mankind.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ETRUSCAN LIFE</li>
</ol>
<p>The Etruscans are among the irritating obscurities of history. They
ruled Rome for a hundred years or more, and left upon Roman ways so
varied an influence that Rome can hardly be understood without them; yet
Roman literature is as mute concerning them as a matron anxious to
forget, pub- licly, the surrenders of her youth. Italian civilization,
as literate provision, begins with them: 8000 inscriptions, as well as
many works of art, mingle with their remains; and there are indications
of a lost literature in poetry, drama, and history. 10 But only a few
unrevealing words of the language have been deciphered, and scholarship
stands in deeper darkness today before the Etruscan mystery than that
which shrouded the Egypt of the Pharaohs before Champollion.</p>
<p>Consequently men still debate who the Etruscans were, and when and
whence they came. Perhaps the old tradition has been too readily set
aside; pedants love to disprove the accepted, which mischievously
survives. Most Greek and Roman historians took it for granted that the
Etruscans had come from Asia Minor. 11 Many elements in their religion,
dress, and art suggest an Asiatic origin; many, again, seem natively
Italian. Most likely the civilization of Etruria was an out- growth of
the Villanovan culture, commercially influenced by Greece and the Near
East, while the Etruscans themselves, as they believed, were invaders
from Asia Minor, probably Lydia. In any case, their superior killing
power made them the ruling caste in Tuscany.</p>
<p>We do not know where they landed; but we know that they founded, con-
quered, or developed many cities — not mere villages of mud and straw as
before them, but walled towns with geometrically laid-out streets, and
houses not only of beaten earth, but often of baked brick or stone.
Twelve of these communities joined in a loose Etruscan Federation,
dominated by Tarquinii (now Cometo),</p>
<p>6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Airetium (Arezzo), Perusia (Perugia), and Veii (Isola Farnese).*
Hardships of transportation through mountains and forests collaborated
with the jealous pugnacity of men, here as in Greece, to form
independent city-states, seldom united against external foes; each
cherished its separate security, often stood aside while others were
attacked, and, one after another, succumbed to Rome. But through most of
the sixth century b.c. these allied municipalities constituted the
strongest political force in Italy, with a well-organized army, a famous
cavalry, and a powerful navy that for a time ruled what is still called
the Tyrrhene (i.e., Etruscan) Sea.f</p>
<p>As in the case of Rome, the government of the Etruscan cities began
as a monarchy, became an oligarchy of “first families,” and gradually
gave over to an assembly of propertied citizens the right of choosing
the annual magistrates. So far as we can make out from the tomb
paintings and reliefs, it was a thoroughly feudal society, with an
aristocracy owning the soil and enjoying in luxury the surplus product
of Villanovan serfs and war-won slaves. Under this discipline Tuscany
was reclaimed from forest and swamp, and a system of rural irrigation
and urban sewage was developed beyond anything discoverable in
contemporary Greece. Etruscan engineers built drainage tunnels to take
the overflow of lakes, and cut drained roadways through rock and hill.
12 As early as 700 b.c. Etruscan industry mined the copper of the
western coast and the iron of Elba, smelted the iron ore at Populonia,
and sold pig iron throughout Italy. 18 Etruscan merchants traded up and
down the Tyrrhene Sea, brought amber, tin, lead, and iron from northern
Europe down the Rhine and the Rhone and over the Alps, and sold Etruscan
products in every major port of the Mediterranean. About 500 b.c.
Etruscan towns issued their own coins.</p>
<p>The people themselves are pictured on their tombs as short and
stocky, with large heads, features almost Ariatolian, complexion ruddy,
especially in women; but rouge is as old as civilization. 14 The ladies
were famous for their beauty, 15 and the men sometimes had faces of
refinement and nobility. Civilization had already advanced to a
precarious height, for specimens of dental bridgework have been found in
the graves; 10 dentistry, like medicine and surgery, had been imported
from Egypt and Greece. 17 Both sexes wore the hair long, and the men
fondled beards. Garments followed the Ionian style: an inner shirt like
the chiton, and an outer robe that became the Roman toga. Men as well as
women loved ornament, and their tombs abounded in jewelry.</p>
<p>If we may judge from the gay pictures of the sepulchers, the life of
the Etruscans, like that of the Cretans, was hardened with combat,
softened with luxury, and brightened with feasts and games. The men
waged war lustily, and practiced a variety of virile sports. They
hunted, fought bulls in the arena, and</p>
<p>• The names given are Roman; the Etruscan names are unknown,</p>
<p>t The Greeks called the Etruscans Tyrrheni or Tyrseni; the Romans
called them Etrusci or Tusci. Possibly, like tyrant , the Greek name
came from Tyrrha, a fortress in Lydia. T ower is probably a kindred
word.</p>
<p>ETRUSCAN PRELUDE</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>drove their chariots, sometimes four horses abreast, around a
dangerous course. They threw the discus and the javelin, pole-vaulted,
raced, wrestled, boxed, and fought in gladiatorial bouts. Cruelty marked
these games, for the Etruscans, like the Romans, thought it dangerous to
let civilization get too far from the brute. Less heroic persons
brandished dumbbells, threw dice, played the flute, or danced. Scenes of
bibulous merriment relieve the paintings in the tombs. Sometimes they
are symposia for men only, with vinous conversation; now and then they
show both sexes, richly dressed, reclining in pairs on elegant couches,
eating and drinking, waited on by slaves, and entertained by dancers and
musicians. 18 Occasionally the meal is adorned with an amorous
embrace.</p>
<p>Probably the lady in this case was a courtesan, corresponding to the
Greek hetaira. If we may believe the Romans, the young women of Etruria,
like those of Greek Asia and Samurai Japan, were allowed to obtain
dowries by prosti- tution; 19 a character in Plautus accuses a girl of
“seeking in the Tuscan way to</p>
<p>Religion provided every incentive to a negative morality. The
Etruscan pantheon was fully equipped to terrify the growing ego and ease
the tasks of parentage. The greatest of the gods was Tinia, who wielded
the thunder and the lightning. About him, as a committee pitilessly
carrying out his commands, were the Twelve Great Gods, so great that it
was sacrilege (and we may there- fore neglect) to pronounce their names.
Especially fearsome were Mantus and Mania, master and mistress of the
Underworld, each with an executive horde of winged demons. Least
appeasable of all was Lasa or Mean, goddess of fate, brandishing snakes
or a sword, and armed with stylus and ink to write, and hammer and nails
to affix, her unalterable decrees. Pleasanter were the Lares and Penates
— little statuettes kept on the hearth, and symbolizing the spirits of
field and home. r</p>
<p>The sacred science of ascertaining the future by studying the livers
of sheep or the flight of birds had probably come down to the Etruscans
from Babylonia; but according to their own traditions it had been
revealed to them by a divine boy, grandson of Tinia, who sprang to life
from a furrow freshly turned, and at once spoke with the wisdom of a
sage. Etruscan ritual culminated in the sacrifice of a sheep, a bull, or
a man. Human victims were slaughtered or buried alive at the funerals of
the great. In some cases prisoners of war were massacred as a
propitiation of the gods; so the Phoceans taken at Alalia in 535 b.c.
were stoned to death in the forum of Caere, and some 300 Romans captured
in 358 b.c.</p>
<p>8 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.I</p>
<p>were sacrificed at Tarquinii. The Etruscan appears to have believed
that for every enemy slain he could secure the release of a soul from
hell . 24 The belief in hell was the favorite feature of Etruscan
theology. The dead spirit, as seen in the sepulchral representations,
was conducted by genii to the tribunal of the Underworld, where in a
Last Judgment it was given an oppor- tunity to defend its conduct in
life. If it failed, it was condemned to a variety of torments that left
their mark on Virgil (reared on Mantua’s Etruscan lore), on the early
Christian conception of hell, and, through these and twenty cen- turies,
on Tuscan Dante’s Inferno . From such damnation the good were spared,
and the sufferings of the damned might be shortened by the prayers or
sacrifices of their living friends. The saved soul passed from the
Underworld to the society of the gods above, there to enjoy feasts,
luxuries, and powers depicted hopefully on the tombs.</p>
<p>Normally the Etruscans buried their dead. Those who could afford it
were laid to rest in sarcophagi of terra cotta or stone, and the lid was
topped with reclining figures carved partly in their likeness, partly in
the smiling style of the archaic Greek Apollos ; here, again, Etruscan
traditions contributed to medieval art. Occasionally the dead were
cremated and placed in cinerary urns, which also might be adorned with
the figure of the deceased. In many cases the urn or tomb simulated a
house; sometimes the tomb, cut into the rock, was divided into rooms,
and was equipped for post-mortem living with furniture, utensils, vases,
clothing, weapons, mirrors, cosmetics, and gems. In a tomb at Caere the
skeleton of a warrior lay on a perfectly preserved bed of bronze, with
weapons and chariots beside it; and in a chamber behind his were the
ornaments and jewelry of a woman presumably his wife. The dust that had
been her beloved body was clothed in her bridal robes . 25</p>
<p>in. ETRUSCAN ART</p>
<p>Etruscan art is nearly all that we know of Etruscan history. We can
trace in it the manners and morals of the people, the power of religion
and caste, and the changing tides of economic and cultural contact with
Asia Minor, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. It was an art fettered by
ecclesiastical conventions and liber- ated by technical skill; it
reflected a brutal and obscurantist civilization, but expressed it with
character and force. Oriental influences — Ionic, Cypriot, Egyptian —
dictated its earlier forms and styles, and Greek models dominated its
later sculpture and pottery. In architecture and painting, however, in
bronze statuary and the working of metals, Etruscan art spoke with its
own voice and was unique.</p>
<p>The architectural remains are never more than fragments or tombs.
Parts of Etruria’s city walls still stand— heavy structures of
uncemented masonry firmly and accurately joined. The homes of rich
Etruscans defined the classic design of the Italian house: a
deliberately forbidding external wall, a central atrium or</p>
<p>ETRUSCAN PRELUDE</p>
<p>CHAP. I)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>reception room, an opening in the roof of the atrium to let rain fall
into a cistern below, and a circuit of small chambers surrounding the
atrium and often faced by a colonnaded porch. Vitruvius has described
Etruscan temples, and the tombs sometimes take their form. Essentially
they followed Greek models; but the “Tuscan style” m odified the Doric
by leaving the column unfluted, giving it a base, and planning the cella
on a six-to-five proportion of length to breadth, instead of the more
graceful Attic relation of six-to-three. A cella of brick, a peristyle
of stone, architraves and pediments of wood, reliefs and ornaments in
terra cotta, the whole resting on a podium or elevation, and brightly
painted outside and within: this was the Etruscan temple. For secular
mass architecture — for city gates and walls, aqueducts and drains — the
Etruscans (so far as we know) introduced the arch and vault to Italy.
Apparently they had brought these majestic forms from Lydia, which had
taken them from Babylonia.* But they did not follow up this brilliant
method of covering great spaces without a confusion of columns and an
oppressive weight of architraves. For the most part they walked in the
grooves worn by the Greeks, and left Rome to con- summate the arcuate
revolution.</p>
<p>The most renowned of Etruria’s products is its pottery. Every m useum
abounds in it, setting the weary navigator of ceramic halls to wonder
what unseen perfection exonerates these stores. Etruscan vases, when
they are not clearly copies of Greek forms, are mediocre in design,
crude in execution, barbarous in ornament. No other art has produced so
many distortions of the human frame, so many hideous masks, uncouth
animals, monstrous demons, and terrifying gods. But the black wares (
bucchero nero) of the sixth century b.c. have an Italian vigor, and
perhaps represent an indigenous development of Villanovan styles. Fine
vases were found at Vulci and Tarquinii — imported from Athens or
imitated from black-figured Attic shapes. The Francois Vase, a huge
amphora discovered at Chiusi by a Frenchman of that name, was apparently
the work of the Greek masters Gitias and Ergotimus. The later urns,
red-figured on a black ground, are elegant, but again evidently of Greek
manufacture; their abundance suggests that the Attic potters had
captured the Etruscan market and driven the native workers into merely
industrial production. All in all, the robbers were justified who, when
they rifled Etruscan tombs, left so much of the pottery.</p>
<p>We cannot speak of Etruscan bronzes with such reckless irreverence.
The bronze casters of Etruria were at the top of their craft. They
almost rivaled the potters in productivity; one city alone is reported
to have had two thousand statues in bronze. What remains to us from
their hands belongs mostly to the period of Roman domination. Among
these reliefs two masterpieces stand out?, the Orator who now holds
forth, with Roman dignity and bronze restraint, in the Archeological
Museum at Florence; and — also at Florence — the Chimera found at Arezzo
in 1553, and partly restored by Cellini. It is a disagreeable</p>

Nineveh. Some</p>

<p>figure, presumably the monster slain by Bellerophon — head and body
of a lion, a serpent for a tail, a goat’s head growing anomalously out
of the back; but its power and finish reconcile us to its biological
extravagance. Etruscan bronze- workers produced, often for distant
export, millions of statuettes, swords, hel- mets, cuirasses, spears,
shields, utensils, urns, coins, locks, chains, fans, mirrors, beds,
lamps, candelabra, even chariots. Greeting the visitor to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is an Etruscan chariot: body and
wheels of wood, sheathing and tires of bronze, the high front embossed
with figures of consider- able grace. Many bronze objects were
delicately engraved. The surface was coated with wax, the design was
etched in with a stylus, the piece was dipped into acid, the wax-freed
fines were burned into the metal, and then the wax was melted away. In
the working of silver and gold, bone and ivory, the Etruscan artist was
the heir and peer of the Egyptian and the Greek.</p>
<p>Sculpture in stone was never popular in Etruria. Marble was scarce,
and the quarries of Carrara were apparently unknown. Fine clays were at
hand, how- ever, and soon took shape in a profusion of terra-cotta
reliefs, statuettes, and sepulchral or architectural ornaments. About
the end of the sixth century an unknown Etruscan artist established a
school of sculpture at Veii, and molded the chef- d’oeuvre of Etruscan
art— that Apollo of Veii which was found on the site in 1916, and until
lately stood in the Villa Giulia at Rome. Modeled on the Ionian and
Attic Apollos of the time, this engaging statue shows an almost feminine
Mona Lisa face, with delicate smile, archly slanting eyes, and a body of
health, beauty, and life; the Italians call it il Apollo che caimmna —
“the Apollo that walks.” In this, a nd in many excellent figures on
sarcophagi, Etruscan sculptors carried to perfection the Asiatic
stylization of hair and drapery, while in the Orator they or their Roman
heirs established a tradition of realistic portraiture.</p>
<p>Etruscan painting collaborated with that of Greek Italy in
transmitting another art to Rome. The elder Pliny described frescoes at
Ardea “of older age than Rome itself”; and at Caere others of “still
greater antiquity” and “supreme beauty.” 27 The art used pottery, and
the inte riors of homes and tombs, for its surfaces; only tomb frescoes
and vase pictures remain, but in such quantity that every stage of
Etruscan painting can be traced in them, from Oriental and Egyptian,
through Greek and Alexandrian, to Roman and Pompeian styles. In some
tombs we find the first Italian examples of windows, portals, columns,
porticoes, and other architectural forms mimicked by painting on inner
walls, in the very manner of Pompeii. Often the colors of these frescoes
are faded; a few are astonishingly fresh and brilliant after more than a
score of centuries. The technique is mediocre. In the earlier pictures
there is no perspective, no foreshortening, no use of light and shade to
give fullness and depth; the figures are Egyptianly slender, as if seen
in a horizontally convex mirror; the faces are regularly in profile,
wherever the feet may point. In the later examples perspec- tive and
foreshortening appear, and the proportions of the body are represented
with greater fidelity and skill. But in either case there is in these
paintings a</p>
<p>CHAP, i) ETRUSCAN PRELUDE II</p>
<p>frolicsome and impish vivacity that makes one wonder how pleasant the
life of the Etruscans must have been, if their tombs were so gay.</p>
<p>Here are men in battle, and enjoying it; or they play at war in the
jousts of the arena. They hunt the boar or lion with all the bravery of
men who have or expect an audience; they box or wrestle in the
palaestra, while the spectators dispute more violently than the
combatants; they ride their horses, or drive their chariots, around the
amphitheater; sometimes, resigned to peace, they fish. One pleasant
scene shows a couple idly boating on a quiet stream: so old is wisdom.
In a grave at Caere the pictured man and his lady recline on a couch;
garlanded with laurel, he pledges her his eternal fidelity with a goblet
of wine; she smiles and believes him, though she knows he lies. In other
burial chambers the Etruscan painter sketches his idea of paradise:
endless revelry, with careless lasses dancing wildly to double-pipes and
the lyre. Pipes and lyres, trumpets and syrinxes, were apparently
essential to every banquet, wedding, and funeral; love of music and the
dance is one of the gracious aspects of Etruscan civiliza- tion. In the
Tomb of the Lioness at Cometo the figures whirl about in nude and
Bacchic frenzy . 28</p>
<p>It was the natural destiny of the Etruscans to expand north and
south, to extend their sway to the foothills of the Alps and the Greek
cities of Cam- pania, and then to find themselves face to face, across
the Tiber, with grow- ing Rome. They established colonies at Verona,
Padua, Mantua, Parma, Modena, Bologna, and beyond the Apennines at
Rimini, Ravenna, and Adria; from this modest Etruscan outpost the
Adriatic took its name. They hemmed in Rome with Etruscan settlements at
Fidenae, Praeneste (Pales- trina), and Capua, perhaps also at Cicero’s
Tusculum (“little Tuscany”). Finally — in 618 b.c., according to a
precise and precarious tradition — an Etruscan adventurer captured the
throne of Rome; and for a century the Roman nation was ruled and formed
by Etruscan civilization and power.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ROME UNDER THE KINGS</li>
</ol>
<p>About iooo b.c. Villanovan migrants crossed the Tiber and settled in
Latium. No one knows whether they conquered, or exterminated, or merely
married the neolithic population they found there. Slowly the
agricultural villages of this historic region between the Tiber and the
Bay of Naples coalesced into a few jealously sovereign city-states,
loath to unite except in annual religious festivals or occasional wars.
The strongest was Alba Longa, lying at the foot of Mt. Alban, probably
where Castel Gandolfo now shelters the Pope on summer days. It was from
Alba Longa, perhaps in the eighth century before Christ, that a colony
of Latins — greedy for conquest, or driven by the pressure of the birth
rate upon the land — moved some twenty</p>
<p>12 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. I</p>
<p>miles to the northwest and founded the most famous of man’s
habitations.</p>
<p>This hazardously hypothetical paragraph contains all that history
dares say about the origin of Rome. But Roman tradition was not so
parsimonious. When the Gauls burned the city in 390 b.c. most historical
records were pre- sumably destroyed, and thereafter patriotic fancy
could paint a free picture of Rome’s birth. What we should call April
22, 753 b.c., was given as the date, and events were reckoned A.U.C. —
armo urbis conditae — “in the year from the city’s foundation.” A
hundred tales and a thousand poem s told how Aeneas, offspring of
Aphrodite- Venus, had fled from burning Troy, and how, after suffering
many lands and men, he had brought to Italy the gods or sacred effigies
of Priam’s city. Aeneas had married Lavinia, daughter of the king of
Latium; and eight generations later their descendant Numitor, said the
story, held the throne of Alba Longa, Latium’s capital. A usurper, Amul
- ius, expelled Numitor and, to end the line of Aeneas, killed Numitor’s
sons and forced his only daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a priestess of
Vesta, vowed to virginity. But Rhea lay down by the banks of a stream
and “opened her bosom to catch the breeze.” 20 Too trustful of gods and
men, she fell asleep; Mars, overcome with her beauty, left her rich with
twins. Amulius ordered these to be drowned. They were placed on a raft,
which kind waves carried to the land; they were suckled by a she-wolf (
lupa ) or — said a skep- tical variant — by a shepherd’s wife, Acca
Larentia, nicknamed Lupa be - cause, like a wolf’s, he r love-making
knew no law. When Romulus and Remus grew up they killed Amulius,
restored Numitor, and went resolutely forth to build a kingdom for
themselves on the hills of Rome.</p>
<p>Archeology offers no confirmation to these stories of our youth;
prob- ably they contain a core of truth. Perhaps the Latins sent a
colony to develop Rome as a strategic moat against the expanding
Etruscans. The site was twenty miles from the sea, and not well adapted
to maritime commerce; but in those days of marauding pirates it was an
advantage to be a bit inland. For internal trade Rome was well placed at
the crossroads of traffic on the river and the land route between north
and south. It was not a healthy location; rains, floods, and springs fed
malarial marshes in the surrounding plain and even in the lower levels
of the city; hence the popularity of the seven hills. The first of these
to be settled, tradition said, was the Palatine, possibly because an
island near its foot made easier there the fording and bridging of the
Tiber. One by one the neighboring slopes were peopled, until the human
overflow crossed the river and built upon the Vatican and Janiculum.*
The three tribes — Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans — that dwelt on the
hills joined in</p>
<p>• There were more than seven of these modest elevations in Rome, and
the “seven” varied from time to time. In Cicero’s day they were the
Palatine, Capitoline, Caelian, Esquiline, Aventinc, Viminal, and
Quirinal.</p>
<p>ETRUSCAN PRELUDE</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>a federation, the Septimontium, and slowly merged into the city of
Rome.</p>
<p>The ancient story goes on to tell how Romulus, to secure wives for
his settlers, arranged some public games and invited the Sabines and
other tribes to attend. During the races the Romans seized the Sabine
women and drove off the Sabine men. Titus Tatius, King of the Sabine
Curites tribe, declared war and advanced upon Rome. Tarpeia, daughter of
the Roman who had charge of a fortress on the Capitoline, opened a gate
to the invaders. They crushed her with their shields in fair recompense;
and later generations gave her name to that “Tarpeian Rock” from which
condemned men were hurled to death. As the troops of Tatius neared the
Palatine, the Sabine women, not insensitive to the compliment of
capture, secured an armistice on the plea that they would lose their
husbands if the Curites won, and their brothers or fathers if the
Curites lost. Romulus persuaded Tatius to share the kingdom with him and
join his tribe with the Latins in a common citizenship; there- after the
freemen of Rome were called Curites or Quirites . 80 There may again be
some elements of truth in this wholesale romance — or perhaps it
patrioti- cally concealed a Sabine conquest of Rome.</p>
<p>After a long reign Romulus was lifted up to heaven in a whirlwind,
there- after to be worshiped as Quirinus, one of Rome’s favorite gods.
Tatius too having died, the heads of the more important families chose a
Sabine, Numa Pompilius, as king. Probably the real power of government,
between the foundation of the city and the Etruscan domination, was in
the hands of these elders, or senatores, while the functions of the
king, like those of the archon basileus in coeval Athens, were chiefly
those of the highest priest . 81 Tradition pictured Numa as a Sabine
Marcus Aurelius, at once philosopher and saint. “He strove,” says
Livy,</p>
<p>to inculcate fear of the gods as the most powerful influence that
could act upon … a barbarous people. But as this effort would fail
to</p>
<p>impress them without some claim to supernatural wisdom, he pre-</p>
<p>tended that he had nocturnal interviews with the divine nymph</p>
<p>Egeria; and that it was on her advice that he was instituting the</p>
<p>religious ritual most acceptable to Heaven, and was appointing
special priests for each major deity . 32</p>
<p>By establishing a uniform worship for the diverse tribes of Rome,
Numa strengthened the unity and stability of the state ; 88 by
interesting the bellicose Romans in religion, Cicero thought, Numa gave
his people forty years of peace . 84</p>
<p>His successor, Tullus Hostilius, restored to the Romans their normal
life. “Convinced that the vigor of the state was becoming enfeebled
through in - action, he looked around for a pretext for war.” 35 He
chose Rome’s mother</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>

<p>(chap. 1</p>
<p>city, Alba Longa, as an enemy, attacked it, and completely destroyed
it. When the Alban king broke a promise of alliance, Tullus had him tied
to two chariots and tom to pieces by driving the chariots in opposite
direc- tions. 88 His successor, Ancus Martius, agreed with his martial
philosophy; Ancus understood, according to Dio Cassius,</p>
<p>that it is not sufficient for men who wish to remain at peace to
re-</p>
<p>frain from wrongdoing . . . but the more one longs for peace the</p>
<p>more vulnerable one becomes. He saw that a desire for quiet was not a
power for protection unless accompanied by equipment for war;</p>
<p>he perceived also that delight in freedom from foreign broils
very</p>
<p>quickly ruined men who were unduly enthusiastic over it. 87</p>
<p>V. THE ETRUSCAN DOMINATION</p>
<p>About 655 B.C., proceeds the tradition, Demaratus, a rich merchant
ban- ished from Corinth, came to live in Tarquinii, and married an
Etruscan woman. 88 His son Lucius Tarquinius migrated to Rome, rose to
high position there, and, on the death of Ancus, either seized the
throne or, more probably, was chosen to it by a coalition of Etruscan
families in the city. “He was the</p>
<p>After a reign of thirty-eight years the first Tarquin was
assassinated by the patricians, who aimed to limit the kingship again to
a religious role. But Tarquin’s widow, Tanaquil, took charge of the
situation and was able to transmit the throne to her son Servius
Tullius. Servius, says Cicero, was the first “to hold the royal power
without being chosen by the people” 41 — i.e., by the leading families.
He governed well, and built a protective moat and wall around Rome; but
the great landowners resented his rule and plotted to unseat him.
Consequently he allied himself with the richer members of the plebs, and
reorganized the army and the voters to strengthen his position.</p>
<p>• Perhaps also he cleansed it with sewers. Roman historians ascribed
to him the Cloaca b.c . 40</p>
<p>CHAP, i) ETRUSCAN PRELUDE 15</p>
<p>Taking a census of persons and property, he classified the citizens
according to wealth rather than birth, so that while leaving the old
aristocracy intact, he raised up as a balance to it a class of equites,
literally, horsemen — men who could equip themselves with horse ( equus
) and armor to serve in the cav- alry.* The census reported some 80,000
persons capable of bearing arms; reckoning one woman and one child for
each soldier, and a slave for every fourth family, we may estimate at
260,000 the population of Rome and its subject environs about 560 b.c.
Servius divided the people into thirty-five new tribes, arranging them
according to place of residence rather than kin- ship or rank; thereby,
like Cleisthenes a generation later in Attica, he weak- ened the
political cohesion and voting power of the aristocracy — the class that
rated itself supreme by birth. When another Tarquin, grandson of
Tarquinius Priscus, charged Servius with ruling illegally, he submitted
him- self to a plebiscite and received, says Livy, “a unanimous vote.”
42 Uncon - vinced, Tarquin had Servius assassinated, and announced
himself king.f Under Tarquinius Superbus (“the Proud”) the monarchy
became abso - lute, and Etruscan influence supreme. The patricians had
thought of the rex as the executive of the Senate and chief priest of
the national religion; they could not long consent to unlimited royal
power. Therefore they had killed Tarquinius Priscus and had raised no
hand to protect Servius. But this new Tarquin was worse than the first.
He surrounded himself with a bodyguard, degraded freemen with months of
forced labor, had citizens crucified in the Forum, put to death many
leaders of the upper classes, and ruled with an insolent brutality that
won him the hatred of all influential men . 44 1 Think- ing to gain
popularity by successful wars, he attacked the Rutuli and the Volscians.
While he was with the army the Senate assembled and deposed him (508
b.c.), in one of the great turning points of Roman history.</p>

<p>t Few students are inclined to follow the extreme skepticism of
Ettore Pais, who rejects as legendary all Roman history before 443 b.c.,
and believes that the two Tarquins were one person, who never existed.
48 A tentative and modified acceptance of the traditional story after
Romulus appears to “account for the phenomena” better than any other
hypothesis.</p>
<p>t The traditional account of the Tarquins is probably darkened by
aristocratic and anti- Etruscan propaganda. The history of early Rome
was written chiefly by representatives or admirers of the patrician
class, just as the history of the emperors was later written by sena-
torial partisans like Tacitus.</p>
<p>l6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Ardea, his son, Sextus Tarquin, was debating with a relative, Lucius
Tar- quinius Collatinus, the comparative virtue of their wives.
Collatinus pro- posed that they should take horse to Rome and surprise
their ladies in the late hours of the night. They found the wife of
Sextus feasting with intimates, but Lucretia, wife of Collatinus, was
spinning wool for her husband’s cloth - ing. Sextus was i nflamed with
desire to try Lucretia’s fidelity and enjoy her love. A few days later
he returned secretly to the home of Lucretia and overcame her by wile
and force. Lucretia sent for her father and her hus- band, told them
what had happened, and then stabbed herself to death. Thereupon Lucius
Junius Brutus, a friend of Collatinus, called upon all good men to drive
the Tarquins from Rome. He himself was a nephew of the King; but his
father and his brother had been put to death by Tarquin, and he had
gained his cognomen Brutus — i.e., idiot — by pretending lunacy so that
he might be spared for his revenge. Now he rode with Collatinus to the
capital, told Lucretia’s story to the Senate, and persuaded it to banish
all the royal family. The King had meanwhile left the army and hurried
to Rome; Brutus, apprised of this, rode out to the army, told Lucretia’s
story again, and won the soldiers’ support. Tarquin fled north, and
appealed to Etruria to restore him to his throne . 45 *</p>
<p>An assembly of the citizen-soldiers was now convened; and instead of
a king chosen for life it elected two consuls,! with equal and rival
powers, to rule for a year. These first consuls, says the tradition,
were Brutus and Col- latinus; but Collatinus resigned, and was replaced
by Publius Valerius, who won the name Publicola — “friend of the
people”— by putting through the Assembly several laws that remained
basic in Rome: that any man who should try to make himself Icing might
be killed without trial; that any at- tempt to take a public office
without the people’s consent should be punish - able with death; and
that any citizen condemned by a magistrate to death or flogging should
have the right of appeal to the Assembly. It was Valerius who
inaugurated the custom whereby a consul, upon entering the Assembly,
must part the axes from the rods and lower them as a sign of the
people’s sovereignty and sole right, in peace, to impose a sentence of
death.</p>
<p>The revolution had two main results: it freed Rome from Etruscan as-
cendancy and replaced the monarchy with an aristocracy that ruled Rome
until Caesar. The political position of the poorer citizens was not
improved; on the contrary, they were required to surrender the lands
that Servius had given them, and they lost the modest measure of
protection with which the</p>
<p>• Most students since Niebuhr consign Lucretia to legend and
Shakespeare. We do not know where history retires and poetry enters.
Some have thought even Brutus to be legend ; 46 but here, again,
skepticism has probably gone too far.</p>
<p>t Or, says another tradition, two praetors or generals.</p>
<p>ETRUSCAN PRELUDE</p>

<p>*7</p>
<p>monarchy had shielded them from aristocratic domination. 47 The
victors called the revolution a triumph of liberty; but now and then
liberty, in the slogans of the strong, means freedom from restraint in
the exploitation of the weak.</p>
<p>The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, added to the defeat of the
Etruscans by Greek colonists at Cumae in 524, threatened to end Etruscan
le adership in central Italy. Responding for these reasons to Tarquin’s
appeal, Lars Porsena, chief magistrate of Clusium, collected an army
from the feder- ated cities of Etruria and advanced upon Rome. At the
same time an attempt was made in Rome itself to restore Tarquin. The two
sons of Brutus were among the arrested conspirators, and the fiery first
consul provided an exemplar — perhaps a myth — for all later Romans when
he witnessed in stoic silence the flogging and beheading of his
children. The Romans destroyed the Tiber bridges before Porsena could
reach them; it was in this defense of the bridgeheads that Horatius
Codes immortalized himself in Latin and English lays. Despite this and
other legends with which defeat tried to cover itself with glory, Rome
surrendered to Porsena, 48 and yielded portions of her territory to Veii
and to the Latin towns that had been despoiled by Rome’s kings. 49
Porsena showed his good taste by not demanding the restoration of
Tarquin; in Etruria, too, by this time, aristocracy had driven out
monarchy. Rome was weakened for a generation, but her revolution
remained.</p>
<p>The Etruscan power had been expelled, but the marks and relics of</p>
<p>Etruscan influence were to survive in Roman civilization to its end.
That influence was apparently least on the Latin language; nevertheless,
the Roman numerals are probably Etruscan, 60 and the name Roma may have
come from the Etruscan rumon, river. 51 The Romans believed that they
had taken from Etruria the ceremonies of a retu rning conqueror’s
triumph, the purple-hemmed robes and ivory curule (chariotlike) seat of
the magistrates, and the rods and axes carried before each consul by
twelve lictors in token of his authority to strike and kill. 62 * The
coins of Rome, centuries before she had a fleet, were adorned with the
prow of a ship — long used in the coinage of Etruria to symbolize her
commercial activity and naval power. From the seventh to the fourth
centuries b.c. it was a custom among Roman aristocrats to send their
sons to Etruscan cities for higher education; there, among other • In an
Etruscan tomb at Vetulonia, dated back to the eighth century b.c., a
double -headed iron ax was found, with its shaft enclosed by eight iron
rods . 53 The double ax as a symbol of government is at least as old as
Minoan Crete. The Romans gave to the bound rods and axes the name of
fasces , bundles. The twelve lictors ( ligare, to bind) owed their
number to the twelve cities of the Etruscan Federation, each of which
provided a lictor for the chief officer of the Federation . 54</p>

<p>things, they learned geometry, surveying, and architecture. 85 Roman
dress derived from the Etruscan, or both from a common source.</p>
<p>The first actors, and their name histriones, came to Rome from
Etruria. It was Tarquinius Priscus, if we may believe Livy, who built
the first Circus Maximus, and imported race horses and pugilists from
Etruria for Roman games. The Etruscans gave Rome brutal gladiatorial
contests, but they also transmitted to Rome a higher status of woman
than could be found in Greece. Etruscan engineers built the walls and
sewers of Rome, and turned it from a swamp into a protected and
civilized capital. From Etruria Rome took most of her religious ritual,
her augurs, haruspices, and soothsayers; as late as Julian (a.d. 363),
Etruscan soothsayers were an official part of every Roman army. With
Etruscan rites Romulus was believed to have laid out the limits of Rome.
From the same source came the Roman wedding cere- mony, with its
symbolism of capture, and the Roman ceremonial funeral. Rome took her
musical modes and instruments from Etruria. 50 Most of her artists were
Etruscans, and the Roman street where the artists worked was called
Vicus Tuscus; the arts themselves, however, may have filtered in through
Latium from the Campanian Greeks. Sculptural portraiture in Rome was
deeply influenced by the death masks made for the family gal- lery — a
custom taken from Etruria. Etruscan sculptors adorned the temples and
palaces of Rome with bronze statuary and terra-cotta figures and
reliefs; Etruscan architects bequeathed to Rome a “Tuscan style” that
still survives in the colonnade of St. Peter’s Church; Etruscan Icings
at Rome seem to have built her first large edifices, and to have
transformed Rome from an assem- blage of earthen or wooden huts into a
city of wood, brick, and stone. Not till Caesar would Rome see again so
much building as under Etruscan rule.</p>
<p>We must not exaggerate. However much Rome learned from her neigh-
bors, she remained, in all the basic features of life, distinctively
herself. Nothing in Etruscan history quite suggests the Roman character,
the grave self-discipline, the cruelty and courage, the patriotism and
stoic devotion that patiently conquered, and then patiently ruled, the
Mediterranean states. Now Rome was free, and the stage was cleared for
the incomparable drama of the grandeur and decline of paganism in the
ancient world.</p>
