<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>Germany on the Eve of Luther</p>
<p>1 453“ I 5 I 7</p>
<p>I. THE AGE OF THE FUGGERS</p>
<p>I N the final half-century before the Reformation all classes in
Germany prospered except the knights. Probably it was the rising status
of the peas- ants that sharpened their resentment against surviving
disabilities. A few were bondsmen, a minority were proprietors, the
great majority were tenant farmers paying rent to feudal lords in
produce, services, or money. The ten- ants complained of the lor d’s
exactions; of the twelve— in some cases sixty- days of labor which
custom required them to give him yearly; of his</p>
<p>withdrawal of land from the Allgemeine or commons in which tradition
had allowed them to fish, cut timber, and pasture their animals; of the
damage done to crops by the lord’s huntsmen and hounds; of biased
administration of justice in the local courts which the landlords
controlled; and of the death tax laid upon the tenant family when the
passing of its head interrupted the care of the land. Peasant
proprietors raged at the usurious rates they had to pay for loans to
move their crops, and at the quick foreclosure of farms by clever money
lenders who had made loans to owners obviously unable to re- pay. All
classes of tillers grudged the annual tithe levied by the Church on
their harvests and broods.</p>
<p>These discontents ignited agrarian revolts sporadically throughout
the fifteenth century. In 1431 the peasants around Worms rose in futile
rebellion. They chose as their standard a farmer’s shoe— actually a boot
laced from ankle to knee; they stuck it on poles or painted its likeness
on flags; and Bundschuh — the Bond of the Shoe — became the favorite
title of rebel rural bands in the age of Luther. In 1476 a cowherd, Hans
Bohm, announced that the Mother of God had revealed to him that the
Kingdom of Heaven on earth was at hand. There should be no more
emperors, popes, princes, or feudal lords; all men were to be brothers,
all women sisters; all were to share alike in the fruits of the earth;
lands, woods, waters, pastures, were to be common and free. Thousands of
peasants came to hear Hans; a priest joined him; the bishop of Wurzburg
smiled tolerantly. But when Hans told his fol- lowers to bring to the
next meeting all the weapons they could muster, the</p>
<p>2 93</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>bishop had him arrested; the bishop’s soldiers fired into the crowd
that tried to save him; and the movement collapsed.</p>
<p>In 1491 the peasants on the domain of the abbot of Kempten in Alsace
attacked his monastery, alleging that they were being forced into
serfdom by forged documents; the Emperor Frederick III effected a
compromise. Two years later the feudatories of the bishop of Strasbourg
proclaimed a Bundschuh ; they demanded an end to feudal dues and
ecclesiastical tithes, the abolition of all debts, and the death of all
Jews. They planned to seize the town of Schlettstadt, whence they hoped
to spread their power through Alsace. The authorities got wind of the
plot, seized the leaders, tortured and hanged them, and frightened the
rest into temporary submission. In 1502 the peasants of the bishop of
Speyer formed a Bundschuh of 7,000 men pledged to end feudalism, to
“hunt out and kill all priests and monks,” and to restore what they
believed to have been the communism of their ancestors. A peasant
revealed the scheme in the confessional; ecclesiastics and nobles joined
in circumventing it; the main conspirators were tortured and hanged.
1</p>
<p>In 1512 Joss Fritz secretly organized a similar movement near
Freiburg- im-Breisgau; God, the pope, and the emperor were to be spared,
but all feudal ownership and dues were to be abolished. A peasant who
had been constrained to join this Bund exposed it to his confessor; the
authorities arrested and tortured the leaders; the revolt aborted, but
Joss Fritz lived to join in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1525. In 1517 a
league of 90,000 peasants in Styria and Carinthia undertook to end
feudalism there: for three months their bands attacked castles and slew
lords; finally Emperor Maximilian, who sympathized with their cause but
rebuked their violence, sent against them a small force of soldiery,
which subdued them into sullen peace. But the stage was set for the
Peasants’ War, and the Anabaptist communism, of Ref - ormation
Germany.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a more matter-of-fact revolution was proceeding in German
industry and commerce. Most industry was still handicraft, but it was
in- creasingly controlled by entrepreneurs who provided material and
capital, and bought and sold the finished product. The mining industry
was making rapid progress; great profits were drawn from mining silver,
copper, and gold; gold and silver bullion now became a favorite means of
storing wealth; and the royalties paid for mining rights to territorial
princes — especially to the elector of Saxony who protected Luther 2 —
enabled some of them to re- sist both pope and emperor. Reliable silver
coins were minted, currency multiplied, the passage to a money economy
was almost complete. Silver plate became a common possession in the
middle and upper classes; some families displayed tables or chairs of
solid silver; monstrances, chalices, reli- quaries, even statues, of
silver or gold accumulated in the German churches, and inclined princes
to a religious reform that allowed them to confiscate</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 295</p>
<p>ecclesiastical wealth. Aeneas Sylvius, in 1458, marveled to see
German inn- keepers regularly serving drinks in silver cups, and asked:
“What woman, not only among the nobility but among the plebeians, does
not glitter with gold? — and shall I make mention of horse bridles
embossed with the purest gold, of . . . armor and helmets sparkling with
gold?” 3</p>
<p>The financiers were now a major political power. The Jewish money-
lenders of Germany were displaced by the Christian family-firms of the
Welsers, the Hochstetters, and the Fuggers — all of Augsburg, which, at
the end of the fifteenth century, was the financial capital of
Christendom. Jo- hannes Fugger, a weaver’s son, became a textile
merchant, and left at his death (1409) a small fortune of 3,000 florins
(5,000?). His son Jakob ex- panded the business; when he died (1469) his
wealth ranked seventh in Augsburg. Jakob’s sons Ulrich, Georg, and Jakob
II raised the firm to</p>
<p>supremacy by advancing money to the princes of Germany, Austria, and
Hungary in return for the revenue of mines, lands, or cities. From these
speculative investments the Fuggers derived immense profits, so that by
1500 they were the richest family in Europe.</p>
<p>Jakob II was the culminating genius of the family, enterprising,
ruthless, and industrious. He trained himself stoically by studying
every phase of the business, every advance in bookkeeeping,
manufacturing, merchandising, and finance. He demanded the sacrifice of
everything but the family itself to the business, and the subordination
of every individual Fugger to the family interest; he established the
principle that none but a Fugger should have power in the concern; and
he never allowed his political friendships to influence his loans. He
formed cartels with other firms to control the price and sale of various
products; so in 1498 he and his brothers entered into an agreement with
Augsburg merchants to “corner” the Venetian market in copper and uphold
the price. 4 In 1488 the family lent 150,000 florins to Archduke
Sigismund of Austria, and as security it received the entire yield of
the Schwarz silver mines until the debt should be repaid. In 1492 the
Fuggers intermarried with the Thurzos of Cracow in a cartel to work the
silver and copper mines of Hungary, and to m aintain the “highest
possible prices” for the products. 5 By 1501 the Fuggers were operating
vast mining enterprises in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and
Spain. In ad- dition they imported and manufactured textiles; they
traded in silks, velvets, furs, spices, citrus fruits, munitions,
jewelry; they organized express trans- portation and a private postal
service. By 15 n, when Jakob II became sole head of the firm, its assets
reached 196,791 guilders; by 1527 (two years after his death) its
capital was reckoned at 2,02 1,202 guilders (0,000,000? ) — a profit of
50 per cent per year through sixteen years. 6</p>
<p>Part of this profit came from the Fuggers’ relations with emperors
and popes. Ulrich Fugger made loans to Frederick III; Jakob II became
chief</p>
<p>296 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>broker to Maximilian I and Charles V; the vast extension of the
Hapsburg power in the sixteenth century was made possible by Fugger
loans. Though Jakob rejected the ecclesiastical limitations on interest,
and the attempts of churchmen to fix a “just price” for consumers’
goods, he remained a Catholic, made loans to clergymen to pay their
promotion fees, and, with Ulrich, obtained (1494) the management of
papal finances in Germany, Scandinavia, Bohemia, and Hungary.</p>
<p>In his final years Jakob Fugger was the most honored and unpopular
citizen in Germany. Some Catholics attacked him as a usurer; some nobles
for outbribing them in the pursuit of office or power; some merchants
for his enviable monopolies; many workers for overriding medieval
regulations of trade and finance; most Protestants for managing the
export of German money to the popes. But emperors and kings, princes and
prelates, sent en- voys to him as to a ruler; Diirer, Burgkmair, and the
elder Holbein painted his portrait as a stern and simple realist; and
Maximilian gave him the title of Count of the Empire. Jakob tried to
atone for his wealth by building 106 houses for the poor but Catholic of
Augsburg.* For his bones he raised a pretty chapel in the church of
St. Anna. He died in the odor of sanctity, leav- ing millions of
guilders and no children; the greatest gift of all had been denied
him.</p>
<p>From him we may date the capitalist era in Germany, the growth of
private monopolies, the dominance of businessmen controlling money over
feudal lords owning land. German mining and textiles were already organ-
ized on capitalist lines — i.e., controlled by providers of capital — by
the end of the fifteenth century, following the lead of Flanders and
Italy in textiles a hundred years before. The Middle Ages had thought of
private property as in some measure a public trust: the rights of the
owner were limited by the necessities of the group whose organization
gave him opportunities, facilities, and protection. Perhaps under the
influence of Roman law — which now overshadowed German jurisprudence —
the property owner began to think of his ownership as absolute; he felt
that he had a right to do what he liked with his own. It did not seem
wrong to the Fuggers, the Hochstetters, and the other “merchant princes”
to “corner” a product and then force up its price, or to form cartels
for the limitation of output and the control of trade, or to manipulate
investments so as to cheat small stockholders. 7 In many instances a
merchant placed his agents at the city gates with orders to buy for him
all specified incoming goods, so that he might resell them at his own
price in the town. 8 Ambrose Hochstetter bought up all available quick-
silver, then raised the retail price 7 5 per cent. 9 A German company
bought 600,000 guilders’ worth of pepper from the king of Port ugal at
higher than</p>

</ul>
<p>297</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER</p>
<p>the usual price, on condition that the king would charge a still
higher price to all other importers of pepper from Portugal into
Germany. 10 Partly through such agreements and monopolies, partly
through growing wealth and an increase in the demand for goods, partly
through a rising supply of precious metals from Central Europe and
America, prices mounted between 1480 and 1520 with a celerity rivaled
only in our century. “In a short time, because of usury and avarice,”
Luther complained, “he that coul d formerly live on a hundred guilders
cannot do so now on two hundred.” 11 It is more than a twice-told
tale.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages had seen great inequalities of political power; the
new age of the Fuggers added such economic disparities as Europe had not
known since the millionaires and slaves of Imperial Rome. Some merchant
capitalists of Augsburg or Nuremberg were worth 5,000,000 francs each (
5,000,000? ) . Many bought their way into the landed aristocracy,
sported coats of arms, and repaid highbo rn contempt with “conspicuous
consump - tion.” Joachim Hochstetter and Franz Baumgartner spent 5,000
florins (25,000?) on a single banquet, or gambled with 10,000 florins in
one game. 12 The luxuriously furnished and artistically decorated homes
of rich businessmen aroused the resentment of nobility, clergy, and
proletariat alike. Preachers, writers, revolutionaries, and legislators
joined in fulminating against monopolists. Geiler von Kaisersberg
demanded that they “should be driven out like wolves, since they fear
neither God nor man, and breed famine, thirst, and poverty.” 13 Ulrich
von Hutten distinguished four classes of robbers: merchants, jurists,
priests, and knights, and judged the merchants to be the greatest
robbers of them all. 14 The Cologne Reichstag of 1512 called upon all
civic authorities to proceed “with diligence and severity . . . against
the usurious, ’forestalling, capitalistic companies.” 15 Such decrees
were repeated by other diets, but to no effect; some legislators
themselves had investments in the great merchant firms, agents of the
law were pacified with shares of stock, 16 and many cities prospered
from the growth of un- impeded trade.</p>
<p>Strasbourg, Colmar, Metz, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Vienna, Ratisbon
(Regensburg), Mainz, Speyer, Worms, Cologne, Trier, Bremen, Dort- mund,
Hamburg, Magdeburg, Liibeck, Breslau, were thriving hubs of in- dustry,
commerce, letters, and arts. They and seventy-seven others were “free
cities”— i.e., they made their own laws, sent representatives to the
provincial and Imperial diets, and acknowledged no political obedience
except to the emperor, who was too indebted to them for financial or
military aid to attack their liberties. Though these cities were ruled
by guilds dom- inated by businessmen, nearly every one of them was a
paternalistic “welfare state” to the extent that it regulated production
and distribution, wages and prices and the quality of goods, with a view
to protecting the weak from the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>strong, and to ensure the necessaries of life to all. 17 We should
now call them towns rathei than cities, since none of them exceeded
52,000 population; nevertheless they were as populous as at any time
before the middle of the nineteenth century, 18 and more prosperous than
at any time before Goethe. Aeneas Sylvius, a proud Italian, wrote of
them enthusiastically in 1458:</p>
<p>Never has Germany been richer, more resplendent, than today.</p>
<p>. . . Without exaggeration it may be said that no country in
Europe</p>
<p>has better or more beautiful cities. They look as fresh and new as
if</p>
<p>they had been built yesterday; and in no other cities is so much
free- dom to be found. . . . Nothing more magnificent . . . can be found
in all Europe than Cologne, with its wonderful churches, city hall,</p>
<p>towers, and palaces, its dignified burghers, its noble streams, its
fertile cornfields. . . . Nor is Augsburg surpassed in wealth by any
city in the world. Vienna has palaces and churches that even Italy may
envy. 19</p>
<p>Augsburg was not only the financial center of Germany, it was the
main commercial link with then flourishing Italy. It was chiefly
Augsburg mer- chants who built and managed that Fondaco Tedesco, in
Venice, whose walls were frescoed by Giorgione and Titian. So bound to
Italy, Augsburg echoed the Italian Renaissance; its merchants supported
scholars and artists, and some of its capitalists became models of
manners and culture, if not of morals. So Konrad Peutinger, syndic or
mayor in 1493, was diplomat, merchant, scholar, jurist, Latinist,
Hellenist, and antiquarian as well as businessman.</p>
<p>Nuremberg was a center of arts and crafts rather than of large-scale
in- dustry or finance. Its streets were still medievally tortuous, and
shaded by overhanging upper stories or balconies; its red-tiled roofs,
high-peaked gables, and oriel windows made a picturesque confusion
against its rural background and the Pegnitz’ turgid stream. The people
were not as affluent here as in Augsburg, but they were joyous,
gemutlich , and loved to disport themselves in such festivities as their
annual carnival of mask, costume, and dance. Here Hans Sachs and the
Meistersingers sang their lusty airs; here Albrecht Diirer raised German
painting and engraving to their zenith; here the best goldsmiths and
silversmiths north of the Alps made costly vases, church vessels,
statuettes; here the metal workers fashioned a thousand plant, animal,
and human forms in bronze, or wrought iron into handsome railings or
screens; here the woodcutters were so numerous that we wonder how they
could all make a living. The churches of the cities became repositories
and museums of art, for every guild or corporation or prosperous family
com- missioned some work of beauty for the shrine of a patron saint.
Regiomon- tanus chose Nuremberg as his home “because I find there
without di fficulty all the peculiar instruments necessary for
astronomy; and there it is easiest for</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 299</p>
<p>me to keep in touch with the learned of all countries, for Nuremberg,
thanks to the perpetual journeyings of her merchants, may be counted the
center of Europe.” 20 It was characteristic of Nuremberg that the most
famous of her merchants, Willibald Pirkheimer, was also an enthusiastic
humanist, a patron of the arts, and a devoted friend of Diirer’s.
Erasmus called Pirlc - heimer “the chief glory of Germany.” 21</p>
<p>The voyages of Da Gama and Columbus, the Turkish control of the</p>
<p>Aegean, and Maximilian’s wars with Venice disturbed the trade
between</p>
<p>IL THE STATE</p>
<p>How was Germany governed in this critical and formative age?</p>
<p>The knights or lower nobility, who in former years had ruled the
country- side as vassals of feudal seigneurs, were losing their miltary,
economic, and political position. Mercenary troops hired by princes or
cities, and equipped with firearms and artillery, were mowing down
knightly cavalry helplessly brandishing swords; commercial wealth was
raising prices and costs, and was outstripping landed property as a
source of power; cities were establish- ing their independence, and
princes were centralizing authority and law. The knights took some
revenge by waylaying the commerce that passed their way; and when
merchants and municipalities protested, the knights asserted their right
to wage private wars. Comines described the Germany of this time as
prickly with castles from which at any time “robber barons” and their
armed retainers might pour forth to plunder merchant, traveler, and
peasant alike. 22 Some knights made it their custom to cut off the right
hands of the merchants they robbed. Gotz von Berlichingen, though he
him- self had lost his right hand in the service of his prince,
substituted an iron hand, and led knightly bands to attack not only
merchants but cities — Nuremberg, Darmstadt, Metz, and Mainz (1512). His
friend Franz von Sickingen laid claims against the city of Worms,
ravaged its environs, seized its councilors, tortured its burgomaster,
resisted all attempts of Imperial troops to capture him, and was
transiently subdued only by receiving an annual subsidy to serve the
emperor. Twenty-two cities of Swabia — chiefly</p>
<p>500 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>Augsburg, Ulm, Freiburg, and Constance — joined with some of the
higher nobility to re-form the Swabian League (1488); these and other
combi- nations checked the robber knights, and succeeded in having
private war declared illegal; but Germany on the eve of Luther was a
scene of social and political disorder, “a universal reign of force.”
23</p>
<p>The secular and ecclesiastical princes who presided over the chaos
con- tributed to it by their venality, their diverse coinages and
customs dues, their confused competition for wealth and place, their
distortion of Roman Law to give themselves almost absolute authority at
the expense of the people, the knights, and the emperor. Great families
like the Hohenzollerns in Brandenburg, the Wettins in Saxony, the
Wittelsbachers in the Palatinate, the dukes of Wiirttemberg, not to
speak of the Hapsburgs of Austria, be- haved like irresponsible
sovereigns. If the power of the Catholic emperor over the German princes
had been greater the Reformation might have been defeated or postponed.
And the rejection of Rome by many of the princes was a further move
toward financial and political independence.</p>
<p>The character of the emperors in this period accentuated the weakness
of the central government. Frederick III (r. 1440-93) was an astrologer
and alchemist who so loved the studious tranquillity of his gardens at
Graz that he allowed Schleswig-Holstein, Bohemia, Austria, and Hungary
to detach themselves from the Empire. But toward the end of his
fifty-three-year reign he played a saving stroke by betrothing his son
Maximilian to Mary, heiress to Charles the Bold of Burgundy. When
Charles fought himself into an icy grave in 1477, the Hapsburgs
inherited the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Maximilian I (r. 1493-1519), emperor-elect but never crowned, began
his reign with every omen of success. All the Empire rejoiced in his
good looks and good nature, his unassuming sensibility, his effervescent
cheerful- ness, his generosity and chivalry, his courage and skill in
joust and hunt; it was as if an Italian of the High Renaissance had
mounted a German throne. Even Machiavelli was impressed, calling him “a
wise, prudent, God -fearing prince, a just ruler, a great general, brave
in peril, bearing fatigue like the most hardened soldier … a pattern of
many princely virtues.” 24 But “Max” was not a great general, and he
lacked the cynical intellect required for Machiavelli’s model prince. He
dreamed of restoring the grandeur of the Holy Roman Empire by
recapturing its former possessions and influence in Italy; he invaded
the peninsula time and again in futile wars which the more practical
Diet refused to finance; he allowed himself to think of deposing the
doughty Julius II and making himself pope as well as emperor; 25 and
(like his contemporary, Charles VIII of France) he excused his
territorial am- bitions as necessary preludes to an overwhelming assault
upon the Turks. But he was constitutionally and financially incapable of
sustained enterprise; he was unable to will the means as well as to wish
the ends; and at times he</p>
<p>CHAP. xv) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER }OI</p>
<p>was so poor that he lacked funds to pay for his dinner. He labored to
reform the administration of the Empire, but he violated his own
reforms, and they died with him. He thought too much in terms of the
Hapsburg power. After many disappointments in war he returned to his
father’s policy of diplomatic marriages. So for his son Phili p he
accepted Ferdinand’s offer of Juana’s hand; she was a bit off-color
mentally, but she brought Spain as her dowry. In 1515 he betrothed his
granddaughter Mary and his grandson Ferdinand to Louis and Anne, son and
daughter of Ladislas, King of Bohemia and Hungary; Louis was killed at
Mohacs (1526), Ferdinand became King of Bohemia and (so far as the Turks
would permit) of Hungary, and the Hapsburg power reached its widest
range.</p>
<p>The most amiable facet of Maximilian was his love and encouragement
of music, learning, literature, and art. He applied himself zealously to
the study of history, mathematics, and languages; we are assured that he
could speak German, Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, Walloon, Flemish,
and English, and that on one campaign he talked with seven alien
commanders in their seven different tongues. Partly through his example
and exertions, the dia- lects of South and North Germany merged into a
gemeines Deutsch which became the language of German gover nment, of
Luther’s Bible, and of German literature. Between wars he tried to be an
author, and left compo- sitions on heraldry, artillery, architecture,
hunting, and his own career. He planned an extensive collection of
monumenta — relics and inscriptions — from the German past, but again
funds ran out. He proposed to the popes a calen- dar reform which they
effected eighty years later. He reorganized the Uni- versity of Vienna,
established new professorships of law, mathematics, poetry, and
rhetoric, and made Vienna for a time the most active seat of learning in
Europe. He invited Italian humanists to Vienna, and empowered Conradus
Celtes to open there an academy of poetry and mathematics. He favored
humanists like Peutinger and Pirkheimer, and made the harassed Reuchlin
a Count Palatine of the Empire. He gave commissions to Peter Vischer,
Veit Stoss, Burgkmair, Diirer, and the other artists who flourished in
his reign. He ordered at Innsbruck an ornate tomb to cherish his
remains; it was left i ncomplete at his death, but it gave occasion for
Peter Vischer’s fine statues of Theodoric and Arthur. If Maximilian had
been as great as his plans he would have rivaled Alexander and
Charlemagne.</p>
<p>In the Emperor’s last year Diirer painted an honest por trait of him
— worn out and disillusioned, defeated by the maddening stinginess of
time. “Earth</p>

<p>becoming another Florence; and soon his grandson, inheriting half of
West- ern Europe, would become the most powerful ruler in
Christendom.</p>
<p>HI. THE GERMANS: I3OO-I517</p>
<p>They were probably at this time the healthiest, strongest, most vital
and exuberant people in Europe. As we see them in Wolgemut and Diirer,
in Cranach and Holbein, the men were stout, thick-necked,
massive-headed, lion-hearted animals ready to consume the world and wash
it down with beer. They were coarse but jolly, and tempered their piety
with sensuality. They could be cruel, as witness the awful instruments
of torture that they used on criminals, but they could be merciful and
generous, too, and rarely displayed their theological ferocity in
physical ways; in Germany the In- quisition was bravely resisted and
usually subdued. Their robust spirits made for bibulous humor rather
than dry wit, dulled their sense of logic and beauty, and denied them
the grace and subtlety of the French or Italian mind. Their meager
Renaissance foundered in bibliolatry; but there was a steady
persistence, a disciplined industry, a brute courage, in German thought
that enabled them to break the power of Rome, and already gave promise
of making them the greatest scholars in history.</p>
<p>By comparison with other nations they were clean. Bathing was a
national passion. Every well-arranged house, even in rural districts,
had its bathroom. As in ancient Rome, the numerous public bathhouses
provided much more than baths; men could be shaved there, women could
have their hair dressed, diverse forms of massage were offered, drinking
and gambling were allowed, and relief could be found from monogamy.
Usually the two sexes bathed to- gether, chastely clothed; but there
were no laws against flirtations, and an Italian scholar, visiting
Baden- Baden in 1417, remarked that “no baths in the world are more fit
for the fecundity of women.” 27</p>
<p>The Germans of that age could not be accused of puritanism. Their
con- versation, correspondence, literature, and humor were sometimes
coarse by our standards, but that went with their vigor of body and
soul. They drank too much at all ages, and imbibed sexual experience
lavishly in their youth; Erfurt in 1501 seemed to the pious Luth er
“nothing better than a brothel and beerhouse.” 28 German rulers,
ecclesiastical as well as secular, agreed</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 303</p>
<p>hotuser , or houses of women; King Sigismund was honored with this
privilege at Bern (1414) and Ulm (1434), so heartily to his satisfaction
that he pub- licly thanked his hosts for it. 30 Unlicensed women
sometimes set up Wink el- haiiser — irregular houses; in 1492 the
licensed prostitutes of Nuremberg complained to the burgomaster of this
unfair competition; in 1 508 they re- ceived permission to storm the
Winkelhaus; they did. In the actual moral code of Europe in the later
Middle Ages resort to a prostitute was condoned as a venial but normal
sin. Perhaps the spread of syphilis after 1492 made it a mortal
affair.</p>
<p>Marriage, as elsewhere, was a union of properties. Love was
considered a normal result, not a reasonable cause, of marriage.
Betrothal was as binding as matrimony. Weddings were ceremonious and
luxurious in all classes; festiv- ities might last for a week or two;
the purchase of a husband was as expensive as the upkeep of a wife. The
authority of the male was theoretically absolute, but was more real in
deeds than in words; we note that Frau Diirer had much to say to her
husband. The women of Nuremberg were undaunted enough to pull the
half-naked Emperor Maximilian from bed, throw a wrap around him, and
lead him in a merry nocturnal dance in the street. 31 According to a
hoary legend, some men of the upper classes in fourteenth-century Ger-
many, when leaving for extended absences from home, locked an iron
“chastity belt” around the waist and thighs of their wives, and took the
key with them. 32 Traces of the custom are found in medieval Venice and
six- teenth-century France; but in the rare cases that seem authentic
the belt was voluntarily donned by wife or mistress, and the key was
given to hus- band or lover, as a guarantee of fidelity in marriage or
sin. 33</p>
<p>Family life flourished. An Erfurt chronicle reckons eight or ten
offspring per couple as normal; households of fifteen children were not
uncommon. These numbers included bastards, for illegitimate children,
who abounded, were usually taken into the father’s home after his
marriage. Family names came into use in the fifteenth century, often
indicating ancestral occupation or place of origin, but now and then
congealing a moment’s jest into the rigor of time. Discipline was firm
at home and school; even the future Emperor Max received many a
spanking, and no harm seems to have come from it except to parent or
teacher. German homes were now ( c . 1500) the most comfortable in
Europe, with wide staircases, sturdy balustrades, massive furniture,
cushioned seats, carved chests, windows of colored glass, canopied beds,
tapestried walls, carpeted floors, bulging stoves, shelves crowded with
books or flowers or musical instruments or silver plate, and kitchens
gleam- ing with all the utensils for a German feast.</p>
<p>Externally the houses were mostly of wood, and fires were frequent.
Over* hanging eaves and windowed balconies shaded the streets. Only a
few avenues in the larger towns were paved. Street lighting was unknown
except</p>
<p>304 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>on festival evenings; life was unsafe outdoors at night. Petty
criminals were as numerous as the pigs and cows that strayed in the
street. There was no organized police; severe punishments were relied
upon to deter crime. The penalty for robbery was death, or, in mild
theft, cutting off the ears. Blas- phemers had their tongues torn out;
exiles illegally returning to Nuremberg had their eyes gouged out. Women
who had murdered their husbands were buried alive, or were tortured with
red-hot tongs and then hanged. 34 Among the mechanisms of torture
formerly exhibited in the Schloss or Castle of Nuremberg were chests
filled with sharp stones, against which the victim was crushed; racks
for stretching his limbs; braziers to apply fire to the soles of his
feet; sharp iron frames to dissuade him from sitting, lying, or sleep-
ing; and die verfliichte Jungfer, or Cursed Maiden of iron, who received
the condemned with arms of steel, enclosed him in a spiked embrace, and
then, relaxing, let him fall, pierced and bloody and broken, to a slow
death in a pit of revolving knives and pointed bars. 85</p>
<p>Political morality accorded with the general moral laxity. Bribery
was widespread, and worst at the top. Adulteration of goods was common,
despite the live burial of two men at Nuremberg for adulterating wine
(1456). Commercialism — the sacrifice of morals to money — was as
intense as in any age; money, not man, was the measure of all things.
Yet these same hustling burghers gave large sums to charity. “In papal
times,” Luther wrote,</p>
<p>Manners became coarser — in France and England as well as in Germany
— when the plutocracy of money superseded the aristocracy of birth in
con- trolling the economy. Drunkenness was the national vice; both
Luther and Hutten denounced it, though Hutten preferred it to “the
deceit of the Italians, the thievery of the Spaniar ds, the pride of the
French.” 87 Some of the drinking may have been due to the sharp spices
used in preparing meals. Table manners were rough and ready. Forks had
come to Germany in the fourteenth century, but men and women still liked
to eat with their fingers; even in the sixteenth century a preacher
condemned forks as contrary to the will of God, Who “would not have
given us fingers if He had wanted</p>
<p>Dress was grandiose. Workmen were content with cap or felt hat, short
blouse, and trousers overlapping — or tucked into — boots or high shoes.
The middle classes added a vest, and an open coat lined and/or bordered
with fur. But the possessors of pedigree competed feverishly with the
collectors</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 305</p>
<p>of guilders in the glory of their garb. In both these classes the
hats of the men were spacious involutions of costly cloth, sometimes
trimmed with feathers, ribbons, pearls, or gold. Shirts were often of
silk. Outer garments, brightly colored, were lined with fur, and might
be threaded with silver. Rich women wore crowns of gold, or
gold-embroidered hoods, and braided gold thread into their hair; but
modest maidens covered their heads with muslin handkerchiefs tied under
the chin. Geiler von Kaisersberg alleged that smart women had wardrobes
costing as much as 4,000 florins (00,- 000? ) . 39 Men wore their chins
shaved but their hair long; male curls were carefully fostered; note
Diirer’s proud ringlets, and Maximilian’s fancy locks. Finger rings were
a sign or pretense of class, as now. Conradus Celtes remarked that
fashions in clothing changed more rapidly in Germany than elsewhere, and
as often for men as for women. On festive occasions the men might
outshine the women in magnificence.</p>
<p>Festivals were numerous, continuing the medieval spirit of
make-believe and gay display, with a happy moratorium on labor and the
Commandments. Christmas was still Christian, despite its pagan vestiges;
the Christmas tree was to be a seventeenth-century innovation. Every
town celebrated a Kermis (Dutch kerk, church, and mis, Mass) or feast of
its patron saint; men and women would then dance together in the
streets, merriment would be de rigueur, and no saint or preacher could
abate the revel’s rough hilarity. Dancing sometimes became an epidemic
mania, as in Metz, Cologne, and Aix in 1374, or at Strasbourg in 1412.
In some such cases sufferers from St. Vitus’s dance would seek relief
from what they thought to be demoniacal possession, by dancing
themselves to exhaustion, as some young maniacs do today. Men found
other outlets for their instincts in hunting, or in the dying sport of
the joust. Thousands of men and women traveled, often using a dis- tant
shrine as an excuse. They moved in painful delight on horses or mules or
in coaches or sedan chairs, bearing the discomforts of unpaved roads and
unwashed inns. Sensible persons, when they could, journeyed by boat
along the Rhine, the Danube, or the other majestic streams of Central
Europe. By 1500 a postal service, open to all, united the major
towns.</p>
<p>All in all the picture is one of a people too vigorous and prosperous
to tolerate any longer the manacles of feudalism or the exactions of
Rome. A proud sense of German nationality survived all political
fragmentation, and checked supernational emperors as well as
supernatural popes; the Refor- mation would defeat the Holy Roman Empire
as well as the papacy. In the 1,500-year war between Teuton and Roman
victory was once more, as in the fifth century, inclining toward
Germany.</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE MATURING OF GERMAN ART</li>
</ol>
<p>This coming of age first manifested itself in art. We may find it
hard to believe, but it is true, that at the very height of the Italian
Renaissance — from the birth of Leonardo (1452) to the death of Raphael
(1520) — German artists were in demand throughout Europe for their
excellence in every craft</p>
<p>in wood, iron, copper, bronze, silver, gold, engraving, painting,
sculpture, architecture. Perhaps with more patriotism than impartiality,
Felig Fabri of Ulm wrote in 1484: “When anyone wishes to have a first
-rate piece of work- manship in bronze, stone, or wood, he employs a
German craftsman. I have seen German jewelers, goldsmiths, stonecutters,
and carriage makers do wonderful things among the Saracens; they
surpassed even the Greeks and Italians in art.” 40 Some fifty years
later an Italian found this still true: “The Germans,” wrote Paolo
Giovio, “are carrying everything before them in art, and we, sluggish
Italians, must needs send to Germany for good work- men.” 41 German
architects were engaged by Florence, Assisi, Orvieto, Siena, Barcelona,
and Burgos, and were called upon to complete the duomo at Milan. Veit
Stoss captivated Cracow, Diirer received honors in Venice, and Holbein
the Younger took England by storm.</p>
<p>In ecclesiastical architecture, of course, the zenith had passed with
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. None the less a single
generation of Munich citizens raised in Late Gothic their Frauenkirche
(1468-88) or Church of Our Lady, and the Altes Rathaus (1470-88) or Old
Town Hall; in the first two decades of the sixteenth century Freiburg in
Saxony com- pleted its choir, Augsburg built the Fugger Chapel,
Strasbourg Cathedral finished its Lawrence Chapel, and a lovely
Chorlein, or oriel window, was added to the parsonage of the
Sebalduskirche in Nuremberg. Domestic architecture in this period built
charming cottages, with red tiled roofs, tim- bered upper stories,
flower-decked balconies, and spacious eaves to protect the windows from
sun or snow; so in Mittenwald’s arduous climate the un - discourageable
Germans countered the sublimity of the Bavarian Alps with the simple and
cherished beauty of their homes.</p>
<p>Sculpture was the glory of the age. Minor carvers abounded who would
have shone as major stars in a less brilliant galaxy: Nicolaus Gerhart,
Simon Leinberger, Tilman Riemenschneider, Hans Backoff en. . .
.Nuremberg alone in one generation produced a trio of masters hardly
surpassed in equal time by any town in Italy. The career of Veit Stoss
was a tale of two cities Nur- tured in Nuremberg, and acquiring fame as
engineer, bridge-builder, archi- tect, engraver, sculptor, and painter,
he went to Cracow at thirty, and did his best work there in a flamboyant
Late Gothic style that well expressed both the piety and the
excitability of the Poles. He returned to Nuremberg</p>
<p>CHAP, XV) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 307</p>
<ol start="1496" type="1">
<li>with sufficient funds to buy a new house and marry a second wife,
who bore him five children to add to her predecessor’s eight. At the
height of his abundance Veit was arrested for having shared, perhaps
unwittingly, in a forgery; he was branded by burning through both
cheeks, and was forbidden ever to leave Nuremberg again. The Emperor
Maximilian par- doned him and restored his civic rights (1506), but
Stoss remained an out- cast to the end of his painfully long life. In
1517 he carved a large group representing the Annunciation or Angelical
Salutation; he enclosed the two figures — among the most nearly perfect
in all the range of wood sculpture- in a garland of roses, surrounded
this with a rosary, attached seven medal- lions picturing the joys of
the Virgin, and crowned the whole — all in linden wood — with an
unprepossessing portrayal of God the Father. The fragile composition was
suspended from the vault of the choir in the Lorenzkirche, where it
still hangs as a treasured relic of the great city’s halcyon days. For
the Sebalduskirche, Stoss carved in wood a Crucifixion never surpassed
in its kind (1520). In that year his son Andreas, as prior of the
Nuremberg Carmelites, procured for Stoss a commission to design an altar
for a church in Bamberg. While the artist labored on this assignment the
Reformation captured Nuremberg; Andreas was replaced as prior because he
remained a Catholic; Veit himself clung to the colorful faith that had
inspired his art; payments on the altar commission were stopped, and the
work remained in- complete. Stoss spent his final ten years in
blindness, solitude, and desolation, predeceased by his wives, abandoned
by his children, and rejected by an age too absorbed in theology to
recognize that it was losing, at ninety-three (1533), the greatest wood
carver in history. 42</li>
</ol>
<p>A bronze worker equally supreme in his line lived in the same city
and time, but led a quieter and happier life. Peter Vischer the Elder
portrayed himself in a niche of his most famous product as an earnest,
simple laborer, short, stocky, full-bearded, with a leather apron around
his waist, and ham- mer and chisel in his hands. He and his five sons
gave eleven years ( 1 508-19) to their chef- d’oeuvre , the Sebaldusgrab
or Tomb of Sebald, Nuremberg’s patron saint. The enterprise was costly;
funds ran out, and the work lay un- finished when Anton Tucher roused
the citizens to contribute the 800 guild- ers (0,000? ) still required.
This masterpiece is not impressive at first sight; it does not seem to
rival Orcagna’s Tabernacle (1348) at Florence; and the snails and
dolphins on whose backs the structure rests are not the likeliest car-
riers of so immense a weight. But a closer inspection reveals an
astonishing perfection in the parts. The central sarcophagus of silver
is adorned with four reliefs representing the miracles of the saint.
Around it rise the bronze pillars of a Gothic canopy, delicately carved
with Renaissance ornament, and joined in lovely metal lacery at the top.
On the pillars, around the base, in the socles, in the niches of the
crowning baldachin, the artists deposited a</p>
<p>308 the reformation (chap. XV</p>
<p>veritable population of pagan, Hebrew, or Christian figures —
Tritons, Cen- taurs, Nereids, Sirens, Muses, Fauns, Hercules, Theseus,
Samson, the Proph- ets, Jesus, the Apostles, and angels playing music or
sporting with lions or dogs. Some of these effigies are still crude,
many are finished with the precision of a Donatello or a Ghiberti; all
contribute vividly to a varied realization of life. The statues of
Peter, Paul, Matthew, and John rival the Four Apostles that Diirer
painted some seven years later in this same Nurem- berg.</p>
<p>No prince or potentate, we are told, came to Nuremberg in these first
decades of the sixteenth century without visiting Peter Vischer’s
foundry, and many solicited his art. A score of churches displayed his
products, from the great brass candelabra in the Lorenzkirche to the
tomb of Maxi- milian I at Innsbruck. His five sons followed him in
sculpture, but two pre- ceded him in death. Hermann Vischer the Younger,
who died at thirty-one (1517), cast a handsome bronze relief for the
tomb of Cardinal Casimir in the cathedral of Cracow.</p>
<p>As the Vischers excelled in bronze, and Veit Stoss in wood, so Adam
Kraft led all his contemporaries in the sculpture of stone. German
chroniclers pictured him, and Peter Vischer the Elder, and Sebastian
Lindenast (who designed the obsequious electors on the Frauenkirche
clock) as devoted artists and friends. “They were like brothers. Every
Friday, even in their old age, they met and studied together like
apprentices, as the designs that they executed at their meetings prove.
Then they separated, having quite forgotten to eat or drink.” 48 Bom
probably in the same year as Peter</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 309</p>
<p>merit, is typical of Teutonic art — a courageous realism that does
not need idealization to convey a sincere piety and faith.</p>
<p>The minor arts continued the same medieval moods and themes.
Miniaturists were still in sufficient demand to maintain prosperous
guilds. Major artists like Diirer and Holbein drew designs for stained
glass; this art, declining in France and England, now reached its apex
in Germany; the Lorenzkirche, the cathedrals of Ulm and Cologne,
received world-famous windows in this period. Not only churches but
guildhalls, castles, even private homes had some windows of stained
glass. Cities like Nuremberg, Augsburg, Regensburg, Cologne, and Mainz
were proud of their craftsmen-artists: metalworkers who glorified
torches, chandeliers, basins, ewers, locks, trays; goldsmiths whose
products, from spoons to altars, were treasured throughout Europe;
textile workers who wove fine carpets, tapestries, ecclesiastical
vestments, and the ornate garb of the patrician class; devout women who
wore out their fingers and eyes to cover altars and priests with
embroideries and silk. Woodcutters were never better. Michael Wolgemut,
besides painting two magnificent windows for the Lorenzkirche, cut in
wood a dozen altar- masterpieces, and then taught Diirer to surpass
him.</p>
<p>Engraving by cutting a design into wood or copper developed in the
fifteenth century into a mature art, respected on a par with painting.
The greatest painters cultivated it. Martin Schongauer carried it to
completion; some of his engravings — The Scourging of Christ , Carrying
the Cross , St. John on Patmos , The Tempta- tion of St. Anthony — are
among the greatest of all time. 44 Book illustration by engravings
became convenient and popular, and rapidly replaced illumination. The
most famous paintings of the period were multiplied in engravings that
sold readily at book stalls, fairs, and festivals. Lucas van Leyden
showed an astonish- ing precocity in this field, engraving his Mohammed
at fourteen, his Ecce Homo at sixteen (1510), and nearing perfection in
his copper engraving of Maximilian, 45 Dry point engraving, by a pointed
instrument throwing up a burr or ridge of excised metal along the lines
of the des ign, was used by the anonymous “Master of the House Book”
toward 1480. Etching by covering a metal surface with wax, cutting a
design in the wax, and letting an acid eat (German dtzen) into the
exposed lines, grew from the decoration of armor into the incision of
metal plates from which etchings could be printed; Daniel Hopfer, an
armorer, seems to have made the first recorded etching in 1 504.
Burgkmair and Diirer practiced the new art imperfectly; Lucas van Leyden
probably learned it from Diirer, but soon went beyond him to
mastery.</p>
<p>In painting this was Germany’s greatest age. Influenced by both Dutch
and Italian schools, and by their own expatriated Memling, German
painters in the second half of the fifteenth century graduated from
Gothic intensity and un- gainliness into a more graceful line, and
figures that moved with ease in natural scenes reflecting the domestic
life of the triumphant bourgeoisie . Subjects re- mained predominantly
sacred, but secular topics advanced; altarpieces gave way to panel
pictures, and rich donors, no longer satisfied to kneel in the comer of
a religious group, demanded portraits in which they would be all in all.
Painters</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>themselves emerged from medieval anonymity into distinct
individualities, signing their work with their names as a grasp at
immortality. Still anonymous is the “Master of the Life of the Virgin,”
who worked at Cologne toward 1470, and left a Virgin and St. Bernard
with a very German Virgin squeezing milk from her breast for the Child,
before a devout monk who hardly suggests the hound of heaven that
pursued Abelard. Michael Pacher is one of the first who transmitted his
name as well as his work. The Parish Church of St. Wolfgang in
Salzkammergut still shows the massive altarpiece, thirty-six feet long,
that he carved and painted for it in 1479-81; the study of perspective
in these panels shared in the education of German art. Martin Schongauer
brought into his painting the finesse of an accomplished engraver, and
the delicate sentiment of Rogier van der Weyden. Born at Augsburg ( c .
1445), Schongauer settled in Colmar, and developed there a school of
engraving and painting that played a major role in bringing the arts to
fulfillment in Diirer and Holbein.</p>
<p>Year by year the thriving cities of the south stole the leadership of
German art from Cologne and the north. At Augsburg, the center of the
trade with Italy, Hans Burgkmair brought Italian decorative touches into
his pictures, and Hans Holbein the Elder combined Italian ornament with
the high seriousness of the Gothic style. Hans passed his art down to
his sons Ambrose and Hans, whom he fondly portrayed in his paintings.
Ambrose faded from history, but Hans Jr. became one of the glories of
Germany, Switzerland, and England.</p>
<p>The greatest of Diirer’s predecessors was Matthias Gothardt Neihardt,
who by a scholar’si error became known to posterity as Matthias
Griinewald. In the immemorial social heredity of art he learne d the
painter’s magic from Schongauer at Colmar, added his own hunger for fame
and perfection, prac- ticed patiently at Ghent, Speyer, and Frankfurt,
and chose Strasbourg as his home ( 1479) . Probably there he painted his
first master product, a double portrait of Philip II of
Hanau-Lichtenberg and his wife; Diirer himself would never excel this in
depth of penetration and grace of execution. 46 Wandering anew,
Griinewald worked for a while with Diirer at Basel — where he painted
the Portrait of a Man now in New York — and again with Diirer making
woodcuts in Nuremberg. In 1 503 he settled at Seligenstadt, and there
finally he developed his own mature and characteristic style — the
graphic rendering of Biblical scenes with passionate feeling and tragic
power. Archbishop Albrecht made him court painter at Mainz (1509), but
dis- missed him when Griinewald persisted in applauding Luther (1526). H
married unfortunately, and withdrew into a melancholy solitude that maj
have lent some dark shades to the chiaroscuro of his art.</p>
<p>His masterpiece — probably the greatest German painting — is the
complex polyp tych made for a monastery at Isen in 1513. The central
panel shows the Virgin and her Child in an almost Turneresque glow of
golden color</p>
<p>CHAP. Xv) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 311</p>
<p>against a background of distant seas. But the outstanding and
unforgettable panel is a gruesome Crucifixion: Christ in His final
agony, the body covered with wounds and bloody sweat, the limbs
distorted with pain; Mary swoon- ing in the arms of St. John; Magdalen
hysterical with angry and incredulous grief. Still other panels could be
major paintings by themselves: a concert of angels in a Gothic
architectural setting of brilliant reds and browns; a macabre Temptation
of St. Anthony; the same saint and a fellow anchorite in a weird forest
of decaying trees; and a Boschian nightmare apparently symbolizing
Anthony’s dreams. In the predominance of color, light, and feeling over
line, form, and representation this almost theatrical outburst of
pictorial power is the culmination of German Gothic painting on the eve
of the triumph of line and logic in a Diirer who, rooted in the
mysticism of medieval Germany, stretched out hands of longing to the
humanism and art of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p>V. ALBRECHT DURER: 1471-1528</p>
<p>No other nation has so unanimously chosen one of its sons as its
repre- sentative in art as Germany — Protestant and Catholic, North and
South — has chosen Diirer. On April 6, 1928, the four-hundredth
anniversary of his death, the Reichstag in Berlin and the city council
in Nuremberg put aside politics and dogmas to honor the artist whom
Germany loves best. Mean- while connoisseurs vainly offered ,000,000 for
a painting — The Feast of the Rose Garlands — for which Diirer himself
received no guilders (,-</p>
<p>75°?)- 47</p>
<p>His Hungarian father was a goldsmith settled in Nuremberg. Albrecht
was the third of eighteen children, most of whom died in infancy. In the
parental studio the boy learned to draw with pencil, charcoal, and pen,
and to engrave with the burin; he taught himself to observe
microscopically, and to represent objects and subjects in indefatigable
detail, so that in some of his portraits almost every hair seems to have
received its individual stroke of the brush. The father had hoped that
his son would be another goldsmith, but he yielded to the youth’s desire
to widen his art, and sent him as an ap - prentice to Wolgemut (i486).
Albrecht developed slowly; his genius lay in ambition, perseverance,
patience. “God lent me industry,” he said, “so that I learned well; but
I had to put up with a great deal of annoyance from his assistants.” 48

to</p>
<p>his hands, you would have said that you had never seen anything more
elegant. And of his speech the sweetness was so great that one wished it
would never end. 49</p>
<p>Attracted by Schongauer’s engravings, he made his way to Colmar</p>
<p>(1492), only to find that that master was dead. He learned what he
could from Schongauer’s brothers, then passed on to Basel, where he
absorbed from Griinewald the secret of intensely religious art. He was
already a skilled draftsman; an edition of St. Jerome’s letters, printed
at Basel in 1492, bore on its title page a portrait of the saint by
Diirer; and this was so ac- claimed that several publishers competed for
his future work. However, his father urged him to come home and marry; a
wife had been chosen for him in his absence. He returned to Nuremberg,
and settled down to wedded life with Agnes Frey ( 1 494) .</p>
<p>A year earlier he had painted himself as a youth garbed and coiffured
al- most like a woman, proud yet diffident, distrusting and defying the
world. In 1498, still vain of his features, and now also of his beard,
he painted his portrait as a young patrician richly dressed, with
tasseled cap and long brown curls; this is one of the great
self-portraits of all time. In 1500 he pic- tured himself again, more
simply costumed, the face elongated between masses of hair falling to
the shoulders, the penetrating eyes mystically intent; Diirer seems here
to have deliberately presented himself in an imagined like- ness of
Christ, not in impious bravado, but presumably in his oft-voiced opinion
that a great artist is an inspired mouthpiece of God. 50 Vanity was the
prop of his industry. He not only multiplied self-portraits, but found
room for himself in many of his pictures. At times he could be modest,
and sadly conscious of his li mitations. “When we are praised,” he told
Pirk - heimer, “we turn up our noses and believe it all; but perhaps a
master mocker</p>
<p>He could not have been infatuated with his wife, for he set out for
Italy shortly after his marriage, leaving her behind. He had heard of
what he called the “regrowth” of the arts in Italy “after they had been
in hiding for a millennium”; 52 and though he never intimately shared in
that resurrection of classic literature, philosophy, and art which
accompanied the Renaissance, he was anxious to see at first hand what it
was that had given the Italians their excellence in painting and
sculpture, in prose and poetry. He stayed chiefly in Venice, where the
Renaissance had not yet reached full bloom; but when he came back to
Nuremberg (1495) he had somehow received the stimulus that sparked the
rapid productivity of his next ten years. In 1507, with a loan of a
hundred florins (,500?) from Pirkheimer, he went again to</p>
<p>CHAP. Xv) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LTJTHER 3</p>
<p>Italy, and this time he stayed for a year and a half. He studied the
works of Mantegna and Squarcione at Padua, copied drawings humbly, and
was soon recognized by the Bellini and other Venetians as an
accomplished draftsman. The Feast of the Rose Garlands , which he
painted for a German church in Venice, won praise even from the
Italians, who still considered most Ger- mans to be barbarians. The
Venetian Signory offered him a permanent post if he would take up his
residence there, but his wife and friends were im- portuning him to come
back to Nuremberg. He noted that artists had won a much higher social
standing in Italy than in Germany, and resolved to demand a similar
status on his return. “Here,” he wrote, “I am a fine gentle - man; at
home I am a parasite”— i.e., unproductive of material goods . 53</p>
<p>He was delighted by the excitement of art in Italy, the number and
con- flicts of artists, the learned and passionate discussions of art
theories. When Jacopo de’ Barbari expounded to him the principles of
Piero della Francesca</p>
<p>Diirer himself remained in a creative but confusing tension between
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, between German mysticism and
Italian worldliness; and the joy of life that he had seen in Italy never
quite over- came in his soul the medieval meditation on death. Except
for his portraits, his subjects remained almost wholly religious, and
many mystical. Never- theless his real religion was art. He worshiped a
perfect line more than the imitation of Christ. Even in his religious
productions he showed the artist’s driving interest in all the objects
of even the most common daily experience. Like Leonardo, he drew nearly
everything that he saw — rocks, streams, trees, horses, dogs, pigs, ugly
faces and figures, and imaginary beings of marvelous or horrible form.
He drew his left leg as seen in diverse positions, and punched a pillow
into seven different shapes to be studied by his indefati- gable pen. He
crowded his work with a veritable menagerie of animals, and sometimes he
drew a whole city as a background for a picture. He illustrated with
relish and humor the life and doings of country folk. He loved the
Germans, painted their enormous heads and rubicund features without pro-
test, and introduced them into the unlikeliest environments, always
richly robed like prosperous burghers, and wrapped and muffled, even in
Rome or</p>

<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>Palestine, against the German cold. His drawings are an ethnography
of Nuremberg. His chief patrons were its merchant princes, whom he
rescued from death with his portraits, but he received commissions also
from dukes and Imperial electors, and at last from Maximilian himself,
As Titian loved best to portray the nobility and royalty, Diirer was
most at home in the middle class, and his woodcut of the Emperor made
him look like what Louis XII had called him — the “burgomaster of
Augsburg.” Once only Diirer achieved nobility in a portrait — an
imaginary rendering of Charlemagne.</p>
<p>The thirty-six portraits are his most readily enjoyable works, for
they are simple, sensual, earthy, swelling with character. Behold
Hieronymus Holz- schuher, the Nuremberg senator: a powerful head, stern
face, thinning hair on a massive forehead, a beard trimmed to immaculate
symmetry, sharp eyes as if watching politicians, yet with the beginning
of a twinkle in them; here is a man wit h a good heart, good humor, good
appetite. Or consider Diirer’s dearest friend, Willibald Pirkheimer: the
head of a bull concealing the soul of a scholar, and suggesting the
gastric needs of Gargantua. And who would guess, behind the creased and
flattened features of the immense Frederick the Wise of Saxony, the
Elector who defied a pope to protect Luther? Nearly all the portraits
are fascinating: Oswolt Krell, whose earnest con- centration shows even
in the veins of his hands; or Bernhard von Resten, with the delicate
blue blouse, the majestic overspreading hat, the meditative eyes of an
absorbed artist; or Jakob Muffel, burgomaster of Nuremberg, a brown
study of earnest devotion, shedding some light on the greatness and
prosperity of the city; or the two portraits of Diirer’s father, weary
with</p>
<p>Painting was not his forte, nor much to his taste. But his visits to
Italy stirred him to seek color as well as line. For Frederick of Saxony
and his Castle Church in Wittenberg he painted a triptych later known as
the Dresden Altarpiece; here Italian modes of proportion and perspective
framed figures resolutely German: a Frau as the Virgin, a professor as
St. Anthony, a German acolyte as St. Sebastian; the result is not
irresistible. Finer is the Paumgartner Altarpiece in Munich: a splendid
St. Joseph and a Mddchen Marv aeainst an architectural</p>

<p>background of Roman ruins; but the foreground is littered with absurd
mani- kins The Adoration of the Magi, in the Uffizi, is a triumph of
color in the Vii* gin’s blue robe and the gorgeous vestments of the
Oriental kings. Christ among the Doctors shows a pretty Jesus with
girlish curls surrounded by bearded and wrinkled pundits — one a
horrible caricature all nose and teeth. The Feast of the Rose Garlands
rivaled the greatest Italian pictures of the time in its skillfully or-
dered composition, the loveliness of both Mother and Child, the general
splendor of the color; this is Diirer’s greatest painting, but one must
now venture all the</p>
<p>Discouraged by inadequate remuneration for the labor of painting, and
perhaps by the compulsion to repeat old religious themes, Diirer turned
in- creasingly to the more gainful and original work of woodcutting and
engrav- ing; for there one plate could make a thousand copies easily
carried to every market in Europe, and could provide the same
illustration for a thousand printed volumes. Line was Diirer’s forte,
drawing was his realm, wherein no man then alive surpassed him; there
even the proud Italians marveled at his finesse. Erasmus compared him,
as a draftsman, with an ancient master of line:</p>
<p>Apelles was aided by color. . . . But Diirer, though admirable
also</p>
<p>in other respects — what does he not express in monochrome . . . pro-
portions, harmonies? Nay, he even depicts that which cannot be</p>
<p>depicted — fire, rays of light, thunder . . . lightning … all the
sensa-</p>
<p>tions and emotions, in fine, the whole mind of man as it reflects
itself in the behavior of the body, and almost the voice itself. These
things he places before the eyes in the most pertinent lines — black
ones, yet so that if you should spread pigments on them you would injure
the work. And is it not more wonderful to accomplish without the</p>
<p>blandishments of color what Apelles accomplished with their aid?
56</p>
<p>Diirer returned the compliment by engraving a portrait of Erasmus
(1526), not from the living sitter but from the painting by Massys. It
did not rival that portrait, much less Holbein’s; even so it is a master
piece of drawing in the folds and shadows of the cloak, the wrinkles of
face and hands, the ruffled leaves of the open book.</p>
<p>Diirer has left us over a thousand drawings, most of them miracles of
realistic or pious or impishly fanciful design. Some are obvious
caricatures; one is age and wisdom drawn to a hair . 57 Occasionally the
subject is inanimate, as in The Wire-drawing Mill or just plain
vegetation, like A Piece of Turf, or an animal, like the Head of a
Walrus. Usually plants and beasts crowd around living per-</p>
<p>3 16 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>sons, as in the complex Madonna ’with a Multitude of Animals. The
religious subjects are the least successful, but we must except and
honor the remarkable Hands of a Praying Apostle . And lastly there are
fine studies of classic my- thology, like the Apollo or the Orpheus.</p>
<p>Diirer transformed some 250 of his drawings into woodcuts, and a
hundred into engravings; these two groups are the most distinctive
portions of his legacy. Until the turn of the century he incised the
designs himself; later he delegated the woodcutting to others — only by
this collaboration could he have delineated so vast an area of life. He
began by illustrating books like Der Ritter von Turn and Sebastian
Brant’s Narrenschiff ; twenty years afterward he drew fascinating border
figures for the Prayer Book of Maximilian. He tried his pen at nudes,
and succeeded handsomely in The Men’s Bath , not so well in The Women’s
Bath ; in both he served as a revolutionary force in a German art that
had shunned the nude as a scandal or a disillusionment. Famous were the
woodcuts that portrayed the life of the Virgin and the Passion of
Christ. Devout women could now contemplate, by their own hearths, a
print showing the betrothal of Joseph and Mary; and practical Germans
were pleased to find, in The Sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt , all
the cozy details of Teutonic domesticity and industry — Mary sewing,
Joseph working at his bench, and angelic children bringing in firewood
without being asked. Thirty-seven small woodcuts — the “Little Pas -
sion”— and eleven larger ones — the “Great Passion”— brought the story
of the sufferings and death of Christ into thousands of homes, and
whetted the public appetite for Luther’s translation of the New
Testament. Another series illus - trated the Book of Revelation; some of
these woodcuts, like The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and St. Michael
Fighting the Dragon , were so vivid that for centurie s the German mind
thought of the Apocalypse in terms of Diirer’s prints.</p>
<p>From woodcuts he passed to die more painstaking art of engraving. Now
and then he tried dry point etching, as in the chiaroscuro Holy Family;
usually he worked with the burin. The Fall of Man is -sculpture on
copper, in forms worthy of the Greeks, in proportion and symmetry worthy
of the Italians, with Diirer’s customary profusion of fauna and flora,
where nearly every item held for him and his generation a symbolical
significance. Nude females of an excellence un- precedented in German
art emerged from the metal in The Sea Monster and The Combat of Virtue
and Pleasure, with background landscapes beautifully drawn. The sixteen
engravings constituting the “Engraved Passion” are less impressive than
the woodcut Passions. But the St. Eustace is a cornucopia of vivid
designs: five dogs, a horse, a forest, a swarm of birds, a congeries of
castles on a hill, a stag bearing a crucifix between his antlers, and
persuading the hand- some hunter to leave off killing and become a
saint.</p>
<p>In 1 5 1 3-14 Diirer reached his summit as a draftsman in three
Meisterstiche , Master Engravings. The Knight, Death , and the Devil is
a powerful version of a somber medieval theme: a stern-faced rider in
full armor on a Verroc- chian steed, hemmed in by ugly figures of death
and Satan, but moving for- ward resolutely to the triumph of virtue over
all; it seems incredible that</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 317</p>
<p>such plenitude and delicacy of detail could be cut into metal.
St. Jerome in His Study shows a quieter phase of the Christian victory:
the old bald saint bent over his manuscript, writing apparently by the
light of his halo, a lion and a dog lying peacefully on the floor, a
skull sitting in silent eloquence on a window sill, and what looks for
all the world like his wife’s hat hanging on the wall — the whole room
drawn in the most careful perspective, with all shadows and sun rays
meticulously drawn. Finally the engraving that Diirer entitled
Melancholia I reveals an angel seated amid the chaos of an unfinished
building, with a medley of mechanical tools and scientific instru- ments
at her feet; a purse and keys attached to her girdle as emblems of
wealth and power; her head resting pensively on one hand, her eyes
gazing half in wonder, half in terror, about her. Is she asking to what
end all this labor, this building and demolition and building, this
pursuit of wealth and power and the mirage called truth, this glory of
science and Babel of in- tellect vainly fighting inevitable death? Can
it be that Diirer, at the very outset of the modern age, understood the
problem faced by triumphant science, of progressive means abused by
unchanging ends? *</p>
<p>So, drawing by drawing, painting by painting, with an arduous
industry and patience so different from Leonardo’s procrastination and
Raphael’s ease, Diirer passed into the age of Luther. About 1 508 he
bought the house that made Nuremberg famous; the second World War
destroyed it; the tourist trade rebuilt it as a copy of the original.
Its two lower stories were of stone, the third and fourth of pink stucco
and half timber; and over a pro- jecting eave two further stories
crouched under the gabled roof. Here for nineteen years Diirer lived in
moderate misery with his childless wife. Agnes was a simple Hausfrau who
wondered why Albrecht spent so much time on unremunerative studies or
with bibulous friends. He moved in circles be- yond her mental reach,
neglected her socially, traveled most often without her, and when he
took her to the Netherlands, dined with celebrities or with his host,
while leaving his wife to eat “in the upper kitchen” with the ir maid.
88 In 1 504 his widowed mother joined Diirer’s household; she persisted
ten years more; his portrait of her moves our sympathy for the wife —
who was not too charming herself. His friends considered Agnes a shrew
in- capable of sharing Diirer’s rapt intellectual life.</p>
<p>In his later years the Nuremberg master enjoyed a European fame as
the leader and glory of German art. In 1 5 1 5 the Emperor allotted him
a modest pension of a hundred florins a year (,500? ) . This was
irregularly paid, for Maximilian’s income never caught up with his
plans. When Max died the pension stopped, and Diirer decided to visit
the Netherlands and solicit its renewal from Charles V. He took with him
a large assortment of drawings</p>
<p>For other dubious interpretations cf. Panofsky, Diirer , I,
156-71.</p>
<p>3 1 8 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>and paintings to sell or exchange in Holland or Flanders, and managed
thereby to pay nearly all the cost of the trip. The journal that he kept
of his tour (July 1520-July 1521) is almost — not quite — as intimate as
those that Boswell would write two centuries later. It records his
expenses, sales, pur- chases, visits, and honors; it reveals the
burgher’s care with financial details, and the artist’s f orgivable
delight in the recognition of his genius. After chasing Charles through
a dozen cities, Durer obtained the renewal of his pension, and could
give the rest of his journey to viewing the sights and heroes of the
Lowlands. He was astonished by the wealth and beauty of Ghent, Brussels,
and Bruges; by the great polyptych of the Van Eycks in St. Bavon’s, and
by the Antwerp Cathedral, “the like of which I have never seen in German
lands.” 59 He met Erasmus, Lucas van Leyden, Bemaert van Orley, and
other Netherlands worthies, and was feted in the cities by the artists’
guilds. In the mosquito swamps of Zeeland he contracted the malaria that
ruined the health of his remaining years.</p>
<p>One entry in his journal reads: “I have bought Luther’ s tract for
five</p>
<p>white-pennies, and have given one for the Condemnation of that mighty
man.” 60 At Antwerp (May 1 52 1 ) a rumor reached him that Luther had
been “treacherously seized” on leaving the Diet of Worms. Durer did not
know that this abduction had been arranged to protect the Reformer; and
fearing that Luther had been killed, he wrote in his journal a
passionate defense o f the rebel, and an appeal to Erasmus to come to
the aid of his party:</p>
<p>So this man, enlightened by the Holy Ghost to be the continuer</p>
<p>of the true faith, has disappeared. … If he has suffered it is for
the</p>
<p>Christian truth against the unchristian papacy, which works
against</p>
<p>the freedom of Christ, exacting from us our blood and sweat
there-</p>
<p>with to nourish itself in idleness while the peoples famish. O
God!</p>
<p>never were men so cruelly put down under human laws as under those of
the Roman See. . . . Everyone sees how clear is the doctrine an-</p>
<p>nounced in Luther’s books, and how it conforms to the Holy Gospel. We
must preserve these books from being burned; rather let us throw into
the fire the books written to oppose him. . . . All you pious</p>
<p>Christians, deplore with me the loss of this man, and pray the
Lord</p>
<p>that he will send another guide. O Erasmus of Rotterdam, where wilt
thou remain? Wilt thou see the injustice and blind tyranny of the</p>
<p>powers now ruling? Hear me, knight of Christ, ride by the side of</p>
<p>Our Lord XS; old as thou art . . . thou too mayst win the
martyr’s</p>
<p>crown Make thy voice heard! . . . O Erasmus, may God thy Judge</p>
<p>be glorified in thee! 61</p>
<p>When Diirer returned to Nuremberg he devoted himself almost wholly to
religious art, and with new emphasis on the Gospels. In 1 526 he
completed his greatest group of paintings — The Four A postles —
improperly named,</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER. 319</p>
<p>since Mark the Evangelist was not one of the Twelve; but perhaps that
very error pointed to the Protestant idea of returning from the Church
to the Gospels. The two panels are among the proudest possessions of
that Haus det Kunst in which war-wounded Munich has regathered her
famous collec- tions of art. One panel pictures John and Peter, the
other Mark and Paul- all four in gorgeously colored robes hardly
befitting fishermen communist saints; in these vestments Diirer bowed to
Italian idealization, while in the broad and massive heads he asserted
his German environment. Probably these majestic figures had been
intended to form the wings of a triptych for a Catholic church. But in
1525 the municipal council of Nuremberg declared for the Reformation.
Abandoning the plan for an altarpiece, Diirer presented the panels to
the city, and affixed to each panel inscriptions strongly stressing the
import ance of the Gospels. Despite the keys in Peter’s hand — usually
taken as representing the divine establishment and powers of the Church
— these paintings could be interpreted as Diirer’s Protestant testa -
ment.</p>
<p>He had now only two more years to live. Periodic attacks of malarial
fever broke both his health and his spirit. Even in 1522 he had drawn
his final self-portrait as the Man of Sorrows, naked, disheveled,
haggard, sickly, in pain, holding in his hands the scourge and whip of
the Passion of Christ. Nevertheless he worked to the end. When he died
(April 6, 1528), aged fifty-seven, he left enough drawings, woodcuts,
and engravings — besides 6,000 florins — to support his widow in somber
comfort for the remainder of her life. Pirkheimer, who mourned him as
“the best friend I have had in my life,” wrote a simple epitaph for the
tomb:</p>
<p>QUICQUID ALBERTI DURERI MORTALE</p>
<p>FUIT SUB HOC CONDITUR TUMULO</p>
<p>—“Whatever was mortal of Albrecht Diirer lies under this mound.”</p>
<p>He missed supreme stature as an artist by sacrificing the greatest
task o art to a lesser one: he was so charmed to see the passing shapes
of persons, places, and things take lasting life under his hands that he
absorbed himself chiefly in representing the real — lovely or ugly,
significant or meaningless — and only occasionally fused the scattered
elements of sense perception to form in creative imagination, and then
in line or color, ideal beauties to give us goals to aim at, or
revealing visions to offer understanding or peace. But he rose to the
call of his time. He cut into wood or copper a biography of his
expectant and generative generation; his pen or pencil, burin or brush
evoked the hidden souls of the forceful men who trod the stage of the
age; he made</p>

<p>that epoch live for us, across four centuries, in all its

<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE GERMAN HUMANISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a lusty Germany in letters as well as in life and art.
Literacy was spreading. Books were pouring forth from sixteen publishers
in Basel, twenty in Augsburg, twenty-one in Cologne, twenty-foui in
Nuremberg; there Anton Koberger alone employed twenty-four presses and a
hundred men. The trade in books was a major line in the busy commerce of
the fairs at Frankfurt, Salzburg, Nordlingen, and Ulm. “Everybody
nowadays wants to read and write,” said a c ontemporary German; and
another reported: “There is no end to the new books that are written.”
62 Schools multiplied in the towns; every city provided bursaries or
scholarships for poor but able students; nine new universities were
founded in this half-century; and those at Vienna, Heidelberg, and
Erfurt opened their doors to the New Learning. Literary academies arose
in Strasbourg, Augsburg, Basel, Vienna, Nuremberg, and Mainz. Rich
burghers like Peutinger and Pirk- heimer, and the Emperor Maximilian
himself, opened their libraries, art collections, and purses to eager
scholars; and great ecclesiastics like Johann von Dahlberg, Bishop of
Worms, and Albrecht of Brandenburg, Arch- bishop of Mainz, were
enlightened patrons of scholarship, poetry, and art. The Church in
Germany, following the lead of the popes, welcomed the Renaissance, but
emphasized linguistic studies of Biblical and patristic texts. The Latin
Vulgate Bible was printed in twenty-six editions in Germany be- tween
1453 and 1500; there were twenty German translations of the Bible before
Luther’s; 63 the spread of the New Testament among the people pre -
pared them for Luther’s challenging contrast between the Gospels and the
Church; and the reading of the Old Testament shared in the Protestant
re-Judaizing of Christianity.</p>
<p>The humanist movement in Germany was at first — and after its
flirtation with Luther — more orthodox in theology than its Italian
counterpart. Ger- many had no classical past like Italy’s; she had not
had the privilege of being conquered and educated by Imperial Rome; she
had no direct bond with non-Christian antiquity. Her memory hardly went
beyond her Christian centuries; her scholarship, in this age, hardly
ventured beyond the Christian fathers; her Renaissance was a revival of
early Christianity rather than of classic letters and philosophy. In
Germany the Renaissance was engulfed in the Reformation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless German humanism took its lead from Italv. Poggio
Brae-</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 321</p>
<p>ciolini, Aeneas Sylvius, and other humanists, visiting Germany,
brought the seed; German students, pilgrims, ecclesiastics, merchants,
and diplomats, visiting Italy, came back bearing on them, even
unwittingly, the pollen of the Renaissance. Rodolphus Agricola, son of a
Dutch parish priest, received plentiful schooling at Erfurt, Cologne,
and Louvain; gave seven years to further studies of Latin and Greek in
Italy; and returned to teach at Gro- ningen, Heidelberg, and Worms. The
age marveled at his unpopular virtues — modesty, simplicity, honesty,
piety, chastity. He wrote in a Latin almost worthy of Cicero; he
predicted that Germany would soon “app ear no less Latin than Latium”;
64 and indeed, in the next generation, Agricola’s Hol - land produced in
Erasmus a Latinist who would have been quite at home in the Rome of
Tacitus and Quintilian. It was on a trip to Rome that Agricola
contracted the fever from which he died at Heidelberg at the age of
forty- two (1485).</p>
<p>He was rivaled in influence — hardly in amiability — by Jakob
Wimpheling, whose temper was as harsh as his Latin was smooth. Resolved
to lift Ger- many to Italy’s level in education and letters, this
“Schoolmaster of Ger - many” drew up plans for a system of public
schools, established learned societies, and yet foresaw how dangerous
intellectual advance would be without moral development. “What profits
all our learning,” he asked, “ if our characters be not correspondingly
noble, or all our industry without piety, or all our knowledge without
love of our neighbor, or all our wisdom without humility?” 65</p>
<p>The last of these orthodox humanists was Johannes Trithemius, Abbot
of Sponheim, who nevertheless wrote in 1496: “The days of building monas
- teries are past; the days of their destruction are coming.” 66 A less
devout humanist, Celtes, described Trithemius as “abstemious in drink,
disdaining animal food, living on vegetables, eggs, and milk, as did our
ancestors when … no doctors had begun to brew their
gout-and-fever-breeding concoc- tions.” # 67 In his brief life he became
a very summa of learning: skilled in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and their
literatures, and carrying on a correspond- ence with Erasmus,
Maximilian, Imperial electors, and other celebrities. The common people
of the time could only explain his attainments on the theory that he
possessed secret supernatural powers. However, he died at fifty-four
(1516).</p>
<p>Conradus Celtes was the most zealous and effective of the German hu-
manists. Passing like some hurried diplomat of letters from city to
city, studying in Italy, Poland, and Hungary, teaching in Cologne,
Heidelberg, Cracow, Prague, Mainz, Vienna, Ingolstadt, Padua, Nuremberg,

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>earthed precious forgotten manuscripts like the plays of Hrotswitha,
and ancient maps like that which he gave to Peutinger, whose name it
came to bear. Wherever he went he gathered students about him, and
inspired them with his passion for poetry, classical literature, and
German antiquities. In 1447, at Nuremberg, the Emperor Frederick III
crowned him poet laureate of Germany. At Mainz Celtes founded (1491) the
influential Rhenish Lit- erary Society, which included scientists,
theologians, philosophers, physi- cians, historians, poets, such lawyers
as the distinguished jurist Ulrich Zasius, and such scholars as
Pirkheimer, Trithemius, Reuchlin, and Wimpheling. At Vienna, with funds
provided by Maximilian, he organized ( 1501 ) an Acad- emy of Poetry
which became an honored part of the university, and in which teachers
and pupils lived together in the same house and enterprise. In the
course of his studies Celtes apparently lost his religious faith; he
raised such questions as “Will the soul live after death?” and “Is
there, really, a God?” In his travels he took many samples of
femininity, but none to the altar; and he concluded lighthea rtedly that
“there is nothing sweeter under the sun, to banish care, than a pretty
maid in a man’s arms.” 68</p>
<p>This skeptical amoralism grew in fashion among the German humanists
in the final decades before Luther. Eoban Hesse wrote in good Latin
Heroides Christianae (1514), which imitated Ovid even more in scandal
than in form; he included love letters from Magdalen to Jesus, and from
the Virgin Mary to God the Father. To suit the deed to the word, he
lived as loosely as Cellini, outdrank all rivals, and thought nothing of
emptying a bucket of ale at one draught.</p>
<p>Conradus Mutianus Rufus, however, achieved an amiable reconciliation
of skepticism with religion. After studying at Deventer, at Erfurt, and
in Italy, he contented himself with a modest canonry at Gotha, put over
his door the motto Beata tranquillitas, collected admiring students, and
taught them to “esteem the decrees of philosophers above those of
priests”; 69 but, he warned them, they must conceal their doubts of
Christian dogma from the multitude by a gentlemanly adherence to
ecclesiastical ceremonies and forms. 70 “By faith,” he said, “we mean
not the conformity of what we say with fact, but an opinion about divine
things founded upon credulity and profit- seeking persuasion.” 71 He
objected to Masses for the dead as useless, to fasts as unpleasant, and
to auricular confession as embarrassing. 72 The Bible, he thought,
contains many fables, like those of Jonah and Job; prob- ably Christ had
not really died on the cross; the Greeks and the Romans, so far as they
lived honorably, were Christians without knowing it, and doubt- less
went to paradise. 78 Creeds and ceremonies are to be judged not on their
literal claims but by their moral effects; if they promote social order
and private virtue they should be accepted without public questioning.
Mutianus demanded a clean life from his disciples; and in his later
years he vowed, “I</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 323</p>
<p>will turn my studies to piety, and will learn nothing from poets,
philoso- phers, or historians save what can promote a Christian life.”
74 Having lived with all the consolations of philosophy, he died with
all the blessings of the Church (1526).</p>
<p>The natural resentment aroused among the orthodox by the skepticism
of the later humanists fell in accumulation upon the mildest and
kindliest scholar of the time. Johannes Reuchlin observed the medieval
tradition of gathering education from a dozen centers, through the
ubiquity of Latin as the language of instruction in Western Europe. In
the grammar school of his native Pforzheim, in the universities of
Freiburg, Paris, Basel, Orleans, and Poitiers, in Linz, Milan, Florence,
and Rome, he pursued with almost fanatical ardor the study of Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, and law. Following the custom of the German humanists, he
changed his name — which he derived from rauchen, to smoke — to Gzpmo —
kapnos being Greek for smoke. At twenty he compiled a Latin dictionary,
which went through several editions. At Rome Johannes Argyropoulos gave
him a difficult passage in Thucydides to translate; Reuchlin responded
so readily that the old Greek exclaimed: “Greece has now fled beyond the
Alps.” 75 The avid student let no rabbi pass without learning some
Hebrew from him; Mutianus claimed to have heard of Reuchlin giving a
Jewish scholar ten gold pieces for explaining one Hebrew phrase 76 — but
this may have been a humanist’s dream. Pico della Mirandola persuaded
Reuchlin to seek wisdom in the Cabala. Comparing Jerome’s translation of
the Old Testament with the original Hebrew text, “Capnio” pointed out
many errors in what theologians habitually quoted as an infallible
document. At thirty-eight (1493) he was appointed professor of Hebrew in
the University of Heidelberg. The Hebrew dictionary and grammar that he
composed put the study of Hebrew and of the Old Testa- ment on a
scientific basis, and contributed to the powerful influence of the
Hebrew Scriptures on Protestant thought. Gradually his admiration for
Hebrew eclipsed his devotion to the classics. “The Hebrew language,” he
wrote, “is unadulterated, concise, and brief. It is the language in
which God spoke to man, and in which man co nversed with the angels face
to face.” 77 Through all his studies he retained the orthodox faith. He
muddied it a bit with mysticism, but he devoutly submitted all his
writings and teachings to the authority of the Church.</p>
<p>A strange medley of circumstances made him the hero of the German
Renaissance. In 1508 Johannes Pfefferkorn, a rabbi turned priest, issued
a book, Judenspiegel ( Mirror of the Jews), condemning persecution of
the Jews, and clearing them from legendary crimes popularly laid to
their charge, but urging them to give up moneylending and the Talmud,
and accept Christianity. Supported by the Dominicans of Cologne, he
submitted to the Emperor a recommendation that all Hebrew books except
the Old</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>3H</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>Testament should be suppressed. Maximilian ordered that all Jewish
litera- ture critical of Christianity should be surrendered to
PfefFerkorn, and that it should be examined by the universities of
Cologne, Erfurt, Mainz, and Heidelberg, by Jakob van Hoogstraeten, head
of the Inquisition at Cologne, and by Reuchlin because of his fame for
Hebrew learning. All but Reuchlin advised that the books should be
confiscated and burned. Reuchlin’s minor - ity opinion proved a landmark
in the history of religious toleration. He divided Jewish books into
seven classes; one group, consisting of works ex- pressly mocking
Christianity, should be burned; all the rest, including the Talmud,
should be preserved, if only because they contained much of value to
Christian scholarship. Moreover, he argued, the Jews had a right to
freedom of conscience, both as citizens of the Empire and as having
under- taken no obligations to Christianity. 78 In private
correspondence Reuchlin spoke of Pfef ferkom as an “ass” who had no real
understanding of the books he proposed to destroy.</p>
<p>Pfefferkorn responded to these courtesies in a Handspiegel ( Hand</p>
<p>Mirror) that attacked Reuchlin as a bribed tool of the Jews. Reuchlin
re- torted in the same vituperative vein in an Augenspiegel ( Eyeglass )
that aroused a storm among the orthodox. The theological faculty at
Cologne complained to Reuchlin that his book was making the Jews too
happy, and they urged him to withdraw it from circulation. Maximilian
forbade its sale. Reuchlin appealed to Leo X; the Pope turned the matter
over to various counselors, who reported that the book was harmless. Leo
suspended action, but assured the humanists around him that no harm
should come to Reuchlin. Meanwhile Pfefferkom and his Dominican
supporters accused Reuchlin, be- fore the tribunal of the Inquisition at
Cologne, as an unbeliever and a traitor to Christianity. The archbishop
interposed, and remitted the case to Rome, which passed it on to the
episcopal court of Speyer, which acquitted Reuch- lin. The Dominicans in
their turn appealed to Rome; and the university faculties of Cologne,
Erfurt, Mainz, Louvain, and Paris ordered Reuchlin’s books to be
burned.</p>
<p>It is remarkable — and eloquent of Germany’s cultural vitality in
this age - how many notables now came to Reuchlin’s defense: Erasmus,
Pirkheimer, Peutinger, Oecolampadius of Basel, Bishop Fisher of
Rochester, Ulrich von Hutten, Mutianus, Eoban Hesse, Luther,
Melanchthon, even some of the higher clergy, who, as in Italy, favored
the humanists. Imperial electors, princes, and fifty-three cities
proclaimed their support of Reuchlin. Letters from his defenders were
collected and published (1514) as Clarorum viro- rum epistolae ad
Johannem Reuchlin. In 1515 the humanists sent forth a more devastating
book, Epistolae obscurorum virorum ad venerabilem virum magistrum
Ortuinum Gratium ( Letters of Obscure Men to the Ven- erable Master
Ortuinus Gratius, professor of literature *- ^ologne) . This is</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 325</p>
<p>one of the major satires in literary history. It succeeded so well
that an enlarged edition was issued in 1516, and a continuation a year
later. The authors pretended to be pious monks, admirers of Gratius and
enemies of Reuchlin, and concealed themselves under grotesque pseudonyms
— Nicolaus Caprimulgius (goat-milker), Johannes Pellifex (skin-maker),
Simon Wurst (sausage), Conradus Unckebunck. In Latin made deliberately
bad to imi- tate the monastic style, the writers complained of the
ridicule heaped upon them by the “poets” (as the German humanists were
called) ; they inquired eagerly about the prosecution of Reuchlin;
meanwhile they exposed their absurd ignorance, the grossness of their
morals and their minds; they argued ridiculous questions in solemn
Scholastic form, quoted Scripture in extenu- ation of obscenities, and
unwittingly made fun of auricular confession, the sale of indulgences,
the worship of relics, the authority of the pope — the very themes of
the Reformation. All literate Germany puzzled over the au- thorship of
the volumes; only later was it admitted that Crotus Rubianus of Erfurt,
a disciple of Mutianus, had written most of the first edition, and
Hutten most of the continuation. Roused to anger, Leo X forbade the
read- ing or possession of the book, condemned Reuchlin, but let him off
with the costs of the Speyer trial (1520). Reuchlin, sixty-five and
exhausted, retired into obscurity, peacefully lost in the glare of the
Reform.</p>
<p>The German humanist movement too disappeared in that conflagration.
On one side it was fought by most of the universities; on the other, the
Re- formers, engaged in a struggle for life, strengthened their cause
with a reli- gious faith that centered on personal salvation in the
other world and left little time for studies of classical civilization,
or of human amelioration here below. The German humanists themselves
invited defeat by failing to ad- vance from Greek literature to Greek
philosophy, by wandering into coarse polemics or a mysticism far less
mature than Eckhart’s. They left no major works; the grammars and
dictionaries that Reuchlin hoped would be his “monument more lasting
than brass” were soon superseded and forgotten. And yet who knows if
Luther would have dared sling his David’s shots at Tetzel and the popes
if the mind of Germany had not been in a measure freed from ultramontane
terrors by the humanists? The followers of Reuchlin and Mutianus were a
vigorous minority at Erfurt, where Luther studied for four years. And
the greatest German poet of the age, nurtured in humanism, became the
ardent herald of the Reformation.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ULRICH VON HUTTEN</li>
</ol>
<p>There were no giants in the German literature of this age before
Luther; there was only an amazing effervescence and fertility. Poetry
was written</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>to be read aloud, and was therefore welcomed In cottage and palace.
Mys- tery and Passion plays continued to be acted, overlaying a rough
piety with a strong interest in dramatic art. By 1450 the German popular
drama was largely secularized. It included, even in the course of
religious plays, crude and sometimes scandalous farces. 79 Humor
frolicked in the literature; now the vicissitudes and drolleries of Till
Eulenspiegel, that wandering trickster (literally, owlglass), romped
through Germany, his merry pranks sparing neither layman nor priest; and
in 1515 his adventures took printed form. Time and again the literature,
as well as the art, showed monks and priests being dragged down to hell.
80 Satire flourished in every literary form.</p>
<p>The most effective satire of the time was the Narrenschiff (1494), or
Ship of Fools, of Sebastian Brant; no one could have expected so lively
a performance from a professor of law and classical literature at Basel.
Brant imagined a fleet (he forgot it en voyage and later called it a
ship) manned by fools and trying to navigate the sea of life. One fool
after another struts the scene; one class after another bears the whip
of the jurist’s angry doggerel — peasant, mechanic, beggar, gambler,
miser, usurer, astrologer, law- yer, pedant, fop, philosopher, priest;
the vanity of ambitious men, the idle- ness of students, the venality of
tradesmen, the dishonesty of journeymen — all get their share of the
blows, and Brant reserves his respect only for the pious and orthodox
Catholic who ordains his life so as to gain paradise. Beautifully
printed, and adorned with woodcuts that pointed each barb of the tale,
the book sailed to triumph everywhere in Western Europe, through a dozen
translations; next to the Bible it was the most widely read book of the
time.</p>
<p>Brant laid his lash tenderly upon the clergy, but Thomas Murner, a
Fran- ciscan friar, attacked monks and priests, bishops and nuns with
satires at once sharper, coarser, and wittier than Brant’s. The priest,
said Murner, is interested in money more than in religion; he coaxes
every possible penny from his parishioners, then pays part of his
gleanings to his bishop for per- mission to keep a concubine. Nuns make
love clandestinely, and the one who has the most children is chosen
abbess. 81 Murner, however, agreed with Brant in fidelity to the Church;
he denounced Luther as one more fool; and in a touching poem Von dem
Untergang des christlichen Glaubens he mourned the decline of Christian
belief and the deepening chaos of the religious world.</p>
<p>if the immense popularity of these satires revealed the scorn in
which even loyal Catholics held their clergy, the still more passionate
satires of Ulrich von Hutten abandoned all hope for the self-reform of
the Church, and called for open revolt. Born of a knightly family in
Franconia, Ulrich was sent at eleven to the monastery of Fulda with the
expectation that he would become a monk. After six years of probation he
fled (1505), and led CHAP. Xv) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 327</p>
<p>the life of a wandering student, composing and reciting poetry,
begging his way and often shelterless, but finding means to make love to
a lass who left her signature in his blood. 82 His small body was almost
consumed with fever; his left leg was often made useless by ulcers and
swellings; his temper took on the irritability of an invalid, but Eoban
Hesse found him “altogether lov - able.” 83 A kindly bishop took him to
Vienna, where the humanists wel - comed him, but he quarreled with them
and moved on to Italy. He studied at Pavia and Bologna, shot poisoned
epigrams at Pope Julius II, joined an in- vading German army in order to
eat, and then, always in pain, made his way back to Germany.</p>
<p>At Mainz fortune gave him a passing smile: he wrote a panegyric on
young Archbishop Albrecht, and received 200 guilders (,000?) in ac-
knowledgment. Albrecht’s court was now a very hive of humanists, many of
them irreverent freethinkers. 84 There Hutten began his contribution to
the Epistolae obscurorum virorum; there he met Erasmus, and was capti-
vated by the great scholar’s learning, wit, and charm. With Albrecht’s
guild - ers and aid from his relenting father, he again sought the sun
of Italy, blasting at every stop the “hypocritical, corrupt race of
theologians and monks.” 86 From the papal capital he sent a warning to
Crotus Rubianus:</p>
<p>Renounce your desire to see Rome, my friend; what you seek there</p>
<p>is not to be found there any longer. … You may live from plunder,</p>
<p>commit murder and sacrilege . . . you may revel in lust and deny God
in heaven; but if you do but bring money to Rome you are a most</p>
<p>respectable person. Virtue and heavenly blessings are sold here; you
may even buy the privilege of sinning in future. You would then be</p>
<p>crazy to be good; sensible folk will be wicked. 86</p>
<p>With gay irony he dedicated to Leo X (1517) a new edition of Valla’s
dev - astating treatise on the fictitious “Donation of Constantine,” and
assured the Pope that most of his papal predecessors had been tyrants,
robbers, and extortioners, who had turned the punishments of the next
world into reve- nue for themselves. 87 This work came into Luther’s
hands, and warmed his ire against the papacy.</p>
<p>Despite the vituperative violence in many of Hutten’s poems, they won
him a scattered fame in Germany. Repatriating himself in 1517, he was
en- tertained at Nuremberg by Konrad Peutinger; and at this rich
scholar’s sug - gestion Maximilian crowned Hutten poet laureate.
Albrecht now took him into his diplomatic service, and sent him on
important missions as far afield as Paris. “When Hutten returned to
Mainz (1518) he found Germany agi- tated by Luther’s theses on
indulgences; and he must have smiled to see his own easygoing Archbishop
uncomfortably involved. Luther was being summoned to Augsburg to face
Cardinal Cajetan and a charge of heresy.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>328</p>

<p>Hutten hesitated; he was attached to the Archbishop emotionally and
finan- cially, but he felt in his blood the call to war. He mounted his
horse and rode off to Augsburg.</p>

<li>THE GERMAN CHURCH</li>
</ol>
<p>What actually was the condition of the German Church in the youth of
Luther? One indication appeared in the readiness of high ecclesiastics
to accept the criticism and critics of the Church. There were some
scattered atheists whose names are lost in the censorship of time; and
Erasmus men- tions “men amongst us who think, like Epicurus, that the
soul dies with the</p>

<p>faithful ministers of the faith to produce or sustain such widespread
piety among the people. The parish priest, as like as not, had a
concubine or a common-law wife; 03 but the lion-loined Germans seem to
have condoned this as an improvement upon promiscuity; and had not the
popes themselves, in this lusty period, rebelled against celibacy? As
for the “regular” clergy— those subject to a monastic regula or rule —
many of their orders were now engaged in earnest self-reform. The
Benedictines had settled into a half- conventual, half-worldly ease, and
the Teutonic Knights continued their loose morals, martial cruelties,
and territorial greed; but the Dominican, Franciscan, and Augustinian
friars returned to the observance of their rules, and performed many
works of practical benevolence . 94 Most zealous in this reform were the
Augustinian Eremites, originally anchorites or hermit monks, but later
gathered into communities. They kept with apparent fidel- ity their
monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and were learned
enough to fill many chairs in German universities. It was this order
that Luther chose when he decided to become a monk.</p>
<p>The complaints against the German clergy were chiefly against the</p>
<p>prelates, and on the score of their wealth and worldliness. Some
bishops and abbots had to organize the economy and administration of
great areas that had come into the possession of the Church; they were
mitered or tonsured feudal seigneurs, and not always the most lenient .
95 These ecclesiastics be- haved like men of the world rather than men
of God; and it was alleged that several of them rode to provincial or
federal diets with their concubines in their trains . 96 A learned
Catholic prelate and historian, Johannes Janssen, has summed up perhaps
too severely the abuses of the German Church on the eve of the
Reformation:</p>
<p>The contrast of pious love and worldly greed, of godly renuncia-</p>
<p>tion and godless self-seeking, made itself apparent in the ranks of
the clergy as well as in other classes of society. By too many among
the</p>
<p>ministers of God and religion preaching and the care of souls
were</p>
<p>altogether neglected. Avarice, the besetting sin of the age,
showed</p>
<p>itself among the clergy of all orders and degrees, in their anxiety
to</p>
<p>increase to the utmost extent all clerical rents and incomes, taxes
and perquisites. The German Church was the richest in Christendom.
It</p>
<p>was reckoned that nearly a third of the whole landed property of</p>
<p>the country was in the hands of the Church — which made it all
the</p>
<p>more reprehensible in the ecclesiastical authorities to be always
seek- ing to augment their possessions. In many towns the church
build-</p>
<p>ings and institutions covered the greater part of the ground.</p>
<p>Within the sacerdotal body itself there were also the most marked</p>
<p>contrasts in respect of income. The lower orders of parochial clergy,
whose merely nominal stipends were derived from the many precari-</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>ous tithes, were often compelled by poverty — if not tempted by</p>
<p>avarice — to work at some trade which was quite inconsistent with</p>
<p>their position, and which exposed them to the contempt of their pa-
rishioners. The higher ecclesiastical orders, on the other hand, en-</p>
<p>joyed abundant and superfluous wealth, which many of them had no
scruples in parading in such an offensive manner as to provoke the</p>
<p>indignation of the people, the jealousy of the upper classes, and the
scorn of all serious minds. … In many places complaints were loud</p>
<p>against the mercenary abuse of sacred things . . . against the large
and frequent sums of money sent to Rome, of annates and hush money. A
bitter feeling of hatred against the Italians . . . began gradually</p>
<p>to gain ground, even amongst men who, like Archbishop Berthold</p>
<p>von Henneberg, were true sons of the Holy Church. “The Italians,”</p>
<p>he wrote on September 9, 1496, “ought to reward the Germans for</p>
<p>their services, and not drain the sacerdotal body with frequent
extor- tions of gold. 97</p>
<p>Germany might have forgiven the worldliness of its bishops if it
could have been spared the pretensions and exactions of the popes. The
rising spirit of nationalism resented the claims of the papacy to hold
no emperor legiti- mate till papally confirmed, and to depose emperors
and kings at will. Con- flicts between secular and ecclesiastical
authorities persisted in appointments to benefices, in the overlapping
jurisdiction of civil and episcopal courts, in the immunity of the
clergy from nearly all civil legislation. German nobles looked with
fretting concupiscence upon the rich possessions of the Church, and
businessmen grieved that monasteries claiming exemption from taxation
were competing with them in manufacturing and trade. 98 The quarrel at
this stage was over material concerns rather than over theological
differ- ences. Says another Catholic historian:</p>
<p>It was the general opinion in Germany that in the matter of taxation
the Roman Curia put on the pressure to an unbearable degree. . . .</p>
<p>Again and again was the complaint made that chancery dues, annates .
. . and consecration fees were unduly raised or unlawfully extended;
that numerous new indulgences were published without the consent of the
bishops of the country, and tithe after tithe raised for a crusade and
diverted to another object. Even men devoted to the Church and the Holy
See . . . often declared that the German grievances against:</p>
<p>Rome were, from a financial point of view, for the most part only too
well founded. 99</p>
<p>In 1457 Martin Meyer, Chancellor to Archbishop Dietrich of Mainz, ad-
dressed to Cardinal Piccolomini an angry recapitulation of the wrongs
that Germany suffered from the Roman Curia:</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) GERMANY ON THE EVE OF LUTHER 33I</p>
<p>The election of prelates is frequently postponed without cause,</p>
<p>and benefices and dignities of all kinds are reserved for the
cardinals and papa) secretaries; Cardinal Piccolomini himself has been
granted a general reservation in an unusual and unheard-of form in
three</p>
<p>German provinces. Expectancies * without number are conferred,</p>
<p>annates and other taxes are collected harshly, and no delay is
granted, and it is also known that more has been exacted than the sums
due. Bishoprics have been bestowed not on the most worthy but on the</p>
<p>highest bidder. For the sake of amassing money, new indulgences</p>
<p>have daily been published, and war tithes imposed, without consult-
ing the German prelates. Lawsuits that ought to have been dealt with at
home have been hastily transferred to the Apostolic tribunal. The
Germans have been treated as if they were rich and stupid barbarians,
and drained of their money by a thousand cunning devices. … For</p>
<p>many years Germany has lain in the dust, bemoaning her poverty</p>
<p>and her sad fate. But now her nobles have awakened as from sleep; now
they have resolved to shake off the yoke , and to win back their ancient
freedom . 100</p>
<p>When Cardinal Piccolomini became Pius II (1458) he defied this chal-
lenge; from Diether von Isenburg he demanded 20,500 guilders before con-
firming him as the next archbishop of Mainz ( 1459). Diether refused to
pay, charging that the sum exceeded every precedent; Pius excommunicated
him; Diether ignored the ban, and several German princes supported him.
Diether engaged a Nuremberg jurist, Gregor Heimburg, to arouse public
sentiment for giving councils supremacy over the popes; Heimburg went to
France to arrange concerted action against the papacy; for a time it
seemed that the northern nations would throw off allegiance to Rome. But
papal agents de- tached from the movement one after another of Diether’s
allies, and Pius appointed Adolf of Nassau to replace him. The armies of
the two arch- bishops fought a bloody war; Diether was defeated; he
addressed to the German leaders a warning that unless they stood
together they would be repeatedly oppressed; and this manifesto was one
of the first documents printed by Gutenberg. 301</p>
<p>German discontent was not quieted by this victory of the popes. After
a large sum of money had gone from Germany to Rome in the jubilee of 1
500, a diet at Augsburg demanded that part of the money should be
returned to Germany. 102 The Emperor Maximilian grumbled that the pope
drew a hundred times more revenue from Germany than he himself could
collect. In 1510, being at war with Pope Julius II, he directed the
humanist Wim-</p>
<ul>
<li>An expectancy was a promise of appointment to a benefice in
anticipation of the in- cumbent’s death or removal. The postponement of
appointments was often due to the rule that between the death of one
bishop and the selection of his successor the revenues of the see went
to the Roman Curia.</li>

<p>332 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>pheling to draw up a list of Germany’s grievances against the papacy;
for a time he thought of proposing the separation of the German Church
from Rome, but Wimpheling dissuaded him on the ground that he could not
ex- pect persistent support from the princes. Nevertheless all the
economic de- velopments of this age prepared for Luther. A basic
diversity of material interests finally opposed the German Reformation —
demanding an end to the flow of German money into Italy — to an Italian
Renaissance that fi- nanced poetry and art with transalpine gold.</p>
<p>Among the people anticlericalism went hand in hand with piety. “A
revo - lutionary spirit of hatr ed for the Church and the clergy,”
writes the honest Pastor, “had taken hold of the masses in various parts
of Germany. . . . The cry of ‘Death to the priests!’ which had long been
whispered in secret, was now the watchword of the day.” 103 So keen was
this popular hostility that the Inquisition, then rising in Spain,
hardly dared condemn anyone in Germany, Violent pamphlets rained
assaults not so much upon the German Church as upon the Roman See. Some
monks and priests joined in the attack, and stirred up their
congregations against the luxury of the higher clergy. Pil- grims
returning from the jubilee of 1500 brought to Germany lurid — often
exaggerated — stories of immoral popes, papal poisonings, cardinals’
roister - ings, and of a general paganism and venality. Many Germans
vowed that as their ancestors had broken the power of Rome in 476, they
or their children would crush that tyranny again; others recalled the
humiliation of the Em- peror Henry IV by Pope Gregory VII at Canossa,
and thought the time had come for revenge. In 152 1 the papal nuncio
Aleander, warning Leo X of an imminent uprising against the Church, said
that five years earlier he had heard from many Germans that they were
only waiting for “some fool” to open his mouth against Rome. 104</p>
<p>A thousand factors and influences — ecclesiastical, intellectual,
emotional, economic, political, moral — were coming together, after
centuries of ob- struction and suppression, in a whirlwind that would
throw Europe into the greatest upheaval since the barbarian conquest of
Rome. The weakening of the papacy by the Avignon exile and the Papal
Schism; the breakdown of monastic discipline and clerical celibacy; the
luxury of prelates, the corrup- tion of the Curia, the worldly
activities of the popes; the morals of</p>

the relic- mongering and peddling of indulgences; the triumph of Islam

<p>extension of literacy and education; the translation and reading of
the Bible; the newly realized contrast between the poverty and
simplicity of the Apostles and the ceremonious opulence of the Church;
the rising wealth and economic independence of Germany and England; the
growth of a middle class resentful of ecclesiastical restrictions and
claims; the protests against the flow of money to Rome; the
secularization of law and government; the intensification of nationalism
and the strengthening of monarchies; the na- tionalistic influence of
vernacular languages and literatures; the fermenting legacies of the
Waldenses, Wyclif, and Huss; the mystic demand for a less ritualistic,
more personal and inward and direct religion: all these were now uniting
in a torrent of forces that would crack the crust of medieval custom,
loosen all standards and bonds, shatter Europe into nations and sects,
sweep away more and more of the supports and comforts of traditional
beliefs, and perhaps mark the beginning of the end for the dominance of
Chris- tianity in the mental life of European man.</p>
