<h4 id="chapter-xii-the-germany-of-bach">CHAPTER XII The Germany of
Bach</h4>
<p>I 7 1 5~5 6</p>
<p>I. THE GERMAN SCENE</p>
<p>I T was not to be expected that Voltaire, as he passed through
Germany, could discipline his volatile Parisian mind to an appreciation
of German bodies, features, manners, speech, Gothic letters, music, and
art. He had probably never heard of Johann Sebastian Bach, who died on
July 1 8, 1750, eighteen days after Voltaire reached Berlin. And
presumably he had not seen Hume’s description of Germany in i 748 as “a
fine country, full of in - dustrious honest people; were it united it
would be the greatest power… in the world.” 1</p>
<p>It was fortunate for France and England that these virile folk,
numbering then some twenty millions, were still divided into more than
three hundred practically independent states, each with its sovereign
prince, its own court, policy, army, coinage, religion, and dress; all
in various stages of economic and cultural development; the whole
agreeing only in language, music, and art. Sixty-three of the
principalities — including Cologne, Hildesheim, Mainz, Trier, Speyer,
Wurzburg — were ruled by archbishops, bishops, or abbots. Fifty-one
cities — chiefly Hamburg, Bremen, Magdeburg, Augsburg, Nur- emberg, Ulm,
and Frankfurt-am-Main — were “free,” i.e., loosely subject, like the
princes, to the head of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Outside of Saxony and Bavaria, most of the German land was cultivated
by serfs legally bound to the soil they tilled, and subject to nearly
all the old feudal dues. As late as 1750, of the eight thousand peasants
in the bish- opric of Hildesheim 4,500 were serfs. 2 Class divisions
were sharp, but they were so mortised in time that the commonalty
accepted them with very little complaint; and they were mitigated by a
greater survival and honoring of seignorial obligations to protect the
peasant in misfortune, to care for him in sickness and old age, to look
after widows and orphans, and to main- tain order and peace. 3 The
Junker landlords in Prussia distinguished them- selves by competent
management of their domains, and their quick adop- tion of improved
agricultural techniques.</p>
<p>Now that Germany had had sixty-seven years to recover from the Thirty
Years’ War, indu stry and commerce were reviving. The Leipziger Messe
was the best-attended fair in Europe; it surpassed the Frankfurt fair
even in</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>he sale of books. Frankfurt and Hamburg reached in this century a
degree of mercantile activity equaled only by Paris, Marseilles, London,
Genoa, Venice, and Constantinople. The merchant princes of Hamburg used
their wealth not merely for luxury and display, but for the enthusiastic
patronage of opera, poetry, and drama; here Handel had his first
triumphs, Klopstock found shelter, and Lessing wrote his Hamburgische
Dratmturgie — e ssays on the Hamburg theater. The German cities were
then, as now, the best- administered in Europe. 4</p>
<p>Whereas in France and England the king had succeeded in bringing the
nobles into subservience to the central government, the electors,
princes, dukes, counts, bishops, or abbots who ruled the German states
had deprived the emperor of any real power over their domains, and had
brought the lower nobility into attendance at the princely courts. Aside
from the free cities, these courts (Residenzen) were the centers of
cultural as well as po- litical life in Germany. The wealth of the
landowners was drawn to them, and was spent in immense palaces,
sumptuous expenditure, and magnificent uniforms that in many cases were
half the man and most of his authority. So Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of
Wiirttemberg, commissioned J. F. Nette and Donato Frizoni to build for
him (1704-33) at Ludwigsburg (near Stutt- gart) an alternative Residenz
so lordly in design and decoration, and so re- plete with elegant
furniture and objects of art, as must have cost his subjects many
thalers and arduous days. The great Schloss, or castle, at Heidelberg,
begun in the thirteenth century, added in 1751 a cellar vat with a
capacity for brewing 49,000 gallons of beer at a time. At Mannheim Duke
Charles Theodore, during his long rule as Elector Palatine (1733-99),
spent 35 mil- lion florins on artistic and scientific institutions,
museums, and libraries, and in support of architects, sculptors,
painters, actors, and musicians. 5 Hanover was not large or magnificent,
but it had a resplendent opera house, luring Handel. Germany was as mad
about music as Mother Italy herself.</p>
<p>Munich too had a great opera house, financed by a tax on playing
cards. But the duke-electors of Bavaria made their capital famous also
for archi- tecture. When his duchy was overrun by Austrians in the War
of the Span- ish Succession, Maximilian Emanuel had found refuge in
Paris and Ver- sailles; when he returned to Munich (1714) he brought
with him a flair for art and the rococo style. With him came a young
French architect, Fran go is de Cuvillies, who built for the next
Elector, Charles Albert, in the park of Nymphenburg, that masterpiece of
German rococo, the little palace called the Amalienburg (1734 — 39).
Simple without, it is a wilderness of ornament within: a domed and
dazzling Hall of Mirrors (Spiegelsaal), with silvered stucco carved in
latticework and arabesques; and a Yellow Room (Gelbes Zimmer) where the
gilt stucco baffles the eye that tries to follow its intricate design.
In the same overwhelming style Josef Effner began and Cuvillies</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>399</p>
<p>completed the Empire Rooms (Reichen Zimmer) in the ducal residence at
Munich. Cuvillies had left France at the age of twenty, before acquiring
the full discipline of French taste; unchecked by him, the German
artists elab- orated the stucco with amateur abandon, achieving retail
perfection within gross exaggeration. The Empire Rooms were shattered in
the Second World War.</p>
<p>Frederick Augustus I “the Strong,” Elector of Saxony (r. 1694
-1733),</p>
<p>was not to be outdone by any Mimchner duke. Despite passing to Warsaw
( 1 697) as King Augustus II of Poland, he found time to tax the Saxons
suffi- ciently to make Dresden “the Florence on the Elbe,” leadin g all
German cities in expenditure on art. “The town is the neatest I have
seen in Ger - many,” reported Lady Mary Montagu in 1716; “most of the
houses are new built; the Elector’s palace very handsome.” 8 Augustus
collected pictures al - most as avidly as concubines; his son, Elector
Frederick Augustus II (r. 1 73 3-63), poured out money on horses and
pictures, and, said Winckel- mann, “brought the arts to Germany.” 7 In 1
743 this younger Augustus sent Algarotti to Italy with ducats to buy
paintings; soon afterward the Elector bought for 100,000 sequins
(00,000?) the collection of Duke Francesco III of Modena; and in 1754 he
bought Raphael’s Sistine Madonna for twenty</p>
<p>A handsome opera house rose in Dresden in 17 1 8; its company must
have excelled, for Handel raided it for his English ventures in 1719;
and under Johann Hasse its orchestra was among the best in Europe. 8 It
was in Dresden that Meissen porcelain was born — but that must have a
story of its own. In the architecture of the Saxon capital the great
name was Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann. For Augustus der Starke he built in
17 11-22 the famous Zwinger Palace as a festival center for the court: a
brilliant baroque complex of columns, arches, lovely mullioncd windows,
balconies, and crowning cupola. The Zwinger was destroyed by bombing in
1945, but the magnifi- cent gate has been rebuilt on the original
design. For the same inexhaustible Elector the Roman architect Gaetano
Chiaveri raised in Italian baroque the Hofkirche, or Court Church
(1738-51); this too was largely ruined and successfully restored.
History is a contest between art and war, and art plays the part of
Sisyphus.</p>

<li>GERMAN LIFE</li>
</ol>
<p>Germany was now leading Europe in elementary education. In 1717 King
Frederick William I of Prussia made primary education compulsory in his
king- dom, and during the next twenty years he founded 1,700 schools to
instruct</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>and indoctrinate the young. These schools were usually taught by
laymen; the role of religion in education was diminishing. Stress was
laid on obedience and industry, and flogging was de rigueur. One
schoolmaster reckoned that in fifty- one years of teaching he had given
124,000 lashes with a whip, 136,715 slaps with the hand, 911,527 blows
with a stick, and 1,115,800 boxes on the ear. In 1747 Julius Hecker, a
Protestant clergyman, established in Berlin the first Real- schule , so
named because it added mathematics and industrial courses to Latin,
German, and French; soon most German cities had similar
institutions.</p>
<p>In the universities the study of Greek rose to new prominence, laying
the foundations for later German supremacy in Hellenic scholarship.
Additional universities rose at Gottingen (1737) and Erlangen (1743).
Financed by the Elector of Hanover (become King of England), Gottingen
followed the Uni- versity of Halle in according freedom of teaching to
its professors, and expand- ing instruction in natural science, social
studies, and law. University students now discarded the academic gown,
wore cloak, sword, and spurs, fought duels, and took instruction from
the looser ladies of the town. Except in philosophy and theology, German
was the language of education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the German language was now in bad repute, for the
aristocracy was adopting French. Voltaire wrote from Berlin (Nove mber
24, 1750): “I find myself here in France; no one talks anything but
French. German is for the soldiers and the horses; it is needed only on
the road.” 9 The German theater</p>
<p>German literature suffered from this lack of national consciousness.
The most influential German author of the age, Johann Christoph
Gottsched, who gath- ered about him a literary circle that made Leipzig
“a little Paris,” used German in his writings, but he imported his
principles from Boileau, denounced baroque art as a glittering chaos,
and called for a return to the classical rules of composi- tion and
style as practiced in the France of Louis XIV. Two Swiss critics, Bod-
mer and Breitinger, attacked Gottsched’s admiration of order and rule;
poetry, they felt, took its power from forces of feeling and passion
deeper than reason; even in Racine a world of emotion and violence
welled up through the classic form. “The best writings,” Bodmer urged,
“are not the result of rules;… the rules are derived from the writings.”
10</p>
<p>Christian Gellert, who exceeded all German writers in popularity,
agreed with Bodmer, Breitinger, and Pascal that feeling is the heart of
thought and the life of poetry. He deserved his Christian name; he was
so respected for the purity of his life and the gentleness of his ways
that kings and princes attended his lectures on philosophy and ethics at
the University of Leipzig, and women came to kiss his hands. He was a
man of unashamed sentiment, who mourned the dead at Rossbach instead of
celebr ating Frederick’s victory; yet Frederick, the greatest realist of
the age, called him “ le plus raissonable de tous les savans allemans ”—
the most reasonable of all German savants. 11 Frederick, however,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>4OI</p>
<p>for him in the battle of Kunersdorf (1759). The King’s judgment of
German literature was harsh but hopeful: “We have no good writers
whatever; perhaps they will arise when I am walking in the Elysian
Fields…. You will laugh at me for the pains I have taken to impart some
notions of taste and Attic salt to a nation which has hitherto known
nothing but how to eat, drink, and fight.” 12 Meanwhile Ka nt,
Klopstock, Wieland, Lessing, Herder, Schiller, and Goethe had been
born.</p>
<p>One German of the time won Frederick’s active sympathy. Christian von
Wolff, son of a tanner, rose to be professor at Halle. Taking all
knowledge as his specialty, he tried t o systematize it on the basis of
Leibniz’ philosophy. Though Mme. du Chatelet called him “un grand
bavard,” a great babbler, he pledged himself to reason, and in his
stumbling way began the Auf kid- rung, the German Enlightenment. He
broke precedent by teaching science and philosophy in German. Just to
list his sixty-seven books would clog our course. He began with a four-
volume treatise on “all the mathematical sci - ences” (1710); he
translated these volumes into Latin (1713); he added a mathematical
dictionary (1716) to facilitate the transition to German. He proceeded
with seven works (1712-25) on logic, metaphysics, ethics, poli- tics,
physics, teleology, and biology, each title beginning bravely with the
words Verniinftige Gedanke, “reasonable thoughts,” as if to fly the flag
of reason at his mast. Aspiring to a European audience, he covered the
same vast area in eight Latin treatises, of which the most influential
were the Fsycho- logia empirica (1732), the Psychologia rationalis
(1734), and the Theologia naturalis (1736). After surviving all these
pitfalls he explored the philos- ophy of law (1740-49); and to crown the
edifice he wrote an auto-</p>
<p>biography.</p>
<p>The systematic march of his scholastic style makes him hard reading
in our hectic age, but now and then he touched vital spots. He rejected
Locke’s derivation of all knowledge from sensation, and served as a
bridge from Leibniz to Kant by insisting on the active role of the mind
in the formation of ideas. Body and mind, action and idea, are two
parallel processes, neither influencing the other. The external world
operates mechanically; it shows many evidences of purposive design, but
there are no miracles in it; and even the operations of the mind are
subject to a determinism of cause and effect. Ethics should seek a moral
code independent of religious belief; it should not rely on God to
terrify men into morality. The function of the state is not to dominate
the individual, but to widen the opportunities for his development. 13
The ethics of Confucius are especially to be praised, for they based
morality not on supernatural revelation but on human reason. 14 “The
ancient emperors and kings of China were men of a phi losophical turn,…
and to their care it is owing that their form of government is of all
the best.” 15</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Despite Wolff’s earnest avowals of Christian belief, many Germans</p>
<p>hought his philosophy dangerously heterodox. Some members of the
Halle faculty warned Frederick William I that if Wolff’s determinism
were to be accepted, no soldier who deserted could be punished, and the
whole struc- ture of the state would collapse. 18 The frightened King
ordered the philoso- pher to leave Prussia in forty- eight hours on
“pain of immediate death.” He fled to Marburg and its university, where
the students hailed him as the apostle and martyr of reason. Within
sixteen years (1721-37) over two hundred books or pamphlets were
published attacking or defending him. One of the first official acts of
Frederick the Great after his accession (1740) was his warm invitation
to the exile to return to Prussia and Halle. Wolff came, and in 1743 he
was made chancellor of the university. He grew more orthodox as he aged,
and died ( 1754) with all the piety of an orthodox Christian.</p>
<p>His influence was far greater than one would judge from his present
paltry fame. France made him an honorary member of her Academie des
Sciences; the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg named him professor
emeritus; the English and the Italians translated him assiduously; the
King of Naples made the Wolffian system obligatory in his universities.
The younger generation of Germans called him the Sage, and felt that he
had taught Germany to think. The old Scholastic methods of teaching
declined, academic freedom increased. Martin Knutzen took the Wolffian
philosophy to the University of Konigsberg, where he taught Immanuel
Kant.</p>
<p>The development of science and philosophy, and the disillusioning
conse- quences of Biblical research, shared with powerful secularizing
forces in weakening the influence of religion on German life. Deistic
ideas, coming in from England through translations and through the
connection of Eng- land with Hanover, spread among the upper classes,
but their effect was negligible compared with the result of the
subordination of the Church- Catholic as well as Protestant — to the
state. The Reformation had for a time strengthened religious belief; the
Thirty Years’ War had injured it; now the subservience of the clergy to
the ruling princes deprived them of the godly aura that had sanctified
their power. Appointments to ecclesiastical office were dictated by the
prince or the local feudal lord. The nobility, as in England, affected
religion as a matter of political utility and social form. The Lutheran
and Calvinist clergy lost status, and Catholicism slowly gained ground.
In this period the Protestant states of Saxony, Wiirttemberg, and Hesse
passed under Catholic rulers; and the agnostic Frederick had to
conciliate Catholic Silesia.</p>
<p>Only one religious movement prospered in Protestant areas — that of
the Unitas Fratrum, the Moravian Brethren. In 1722 some of its members,
op- pressed in Moravia, migrated to Saxony and found refuge on the
estate of</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THE GERMANY OF BACH 403</p>
<p>Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Himself a godson of Philipp
Jakob Spener, the young Count saw in the refugees a chance to revive the
spirit of Pietism. He built for them on his lands the village of
Herrnhut (“the Lord’s hill”), and spent nearly all his fortune in
printing Bibles, catechisms, hymn - books, and other literature for
their use. His travels in America (1741-42), England (1750), and
elsewhere helped to establish colonies of the Unitas Fratrum in every
continent; indeed, it was the Moravian Brethren who in- augurated the
modern missionary activity in the Protestant churches. 17 Peter Bohler’s
meeting with John Wesley in 1735 brought a strong influence of the
Brethren into the Methodist movement. In America they settled near
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and in Salem, North Carolina. They kept their
faith and discipline almost untouched by winds of doctrine and fashions
of dress, perhaps at the cost of some hardness of spirit in their family
relations; but the skeptic must respect the strength and sincerity of
their belief, and its exceptional accord with their moral life.</p>
<p>Morals in this age were generally more wholesome in Germany than in
France, except where imitation of France passed from language to
lechery. In the middle classes family life was subject to an almost
fanatical discipline; fathers habitually whipped their daughters,
sometimes their wives. 18 Fred- erick William I kept the court of Berlin
in fearsome order, but his daughter described the Saxon court at Dresden
as quite up to that of Louis XV in adultery. Augustus the Strong, we are
assured on dubious authority, had 354 “natural” children, some of whom
forgot their common parentage in incestuous beds. Augustus himself was
alleged to have taken, as one of his mistresses, his bastard daughter
Countess Orczelska, 19 who later taught the ars amoris to Frederick the
Great. In the early eighteenth century the faculty of law at the
University of Halle issued a pronouncement defending princely
concubinage. 20</p>
<p>Manners were strict, but laid no claim to Gallic grace or
conversational charm. The nobles, shorn of political power, warmed
themselves with uni- forms and titles. “I have known,” wrote Lord
Chesterfield in 1 748, “many a letter returned unopened because one
title in twenty had been omitted in the direction.” 21 Oliver
Goldsmith’s judgment was patriotically harsh: “Let the Germans have
their due; if they are dull, no nation alive assumes a more laudable
solemnity, or bet ter understands the decorum of stupidity”; 22 and
Frederick the Great agreed with him. 23 Eating continued to be a popular
way of spending the day. Furniture took over the styles of carving and
marquetry then flourishing in France, but there was nothing in France or
England quite as jolly as the gaily colored ceramic stoves that roused
the envy of Lady Mary Montagu. 24 German gardens were Italianate, but
Ger- man houses, with their half-timbered fronts, mullioned windows, and
pro- tective eaves, gave to German towns a colorful charm revealing a
keen,</p>

<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>however unformulated, aesthetic sense. And indeed it was a German,
Alex- ander Baumgarten, who in his Aesthetic (1750) established the
modern use of that term, and announced a theory of beauty and art as a
part and prob- lem of philosophy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>GERMAN ART</li>
</ol>
<p>Pottery was here a major art, for in this period the Germans showed
Europe how to make porcelain. Augustus the Strong hired Johann Friedrich
Bottger to transmute base metals into gold; Bottger failed; but with
Spi- noza’s old friend Walter von Tschirnhaus he established a faience
factory in Dresden, and made experiments that at last succeeded in
producing the first European hard-paste porcelain. In 1710 he moved the
manufacture to Meissen, fourteen miles from Dresden, and there he
continued to refine his methods and products till his death (1719).
Meissen porcelain was painted in rich colors on a white background with
delicate designs of flowers, birds, genre, landscapes, marine views, and
exotic snatches from Oriental dress and life. Under Johann Joachim
Kandler the process was further improved; sculpture in porcelain was
added to painting under glaze; fantastic figurines preserved the persons
of German folklore and comedy; and imaginative masterpieces like the
“Swan Service” of Kandler and Eberlein showed that art could rival in
brightness and smoothness the varied armory of woman. Soon all
aristocratic Europe, even in France, was adorning its rooms with
humorously satirical figures in Meissen porcelain. The town retained its
leadership in the art till 1758, when it was sacked by the Prussian army
in the Seven Years’ War.</p>
<p>From Augsburg, Nuremberg, Bayreuth, and other centers the German
potters poured into German homes a baroque profusion of ceramic prod-
ucts, from the loveliest faience and porcelain to jolly jugs that made
even beer drinking an aesthetic experience. Through most of the
eighteenth cen- tury Germany led Europe not only in porcelain but in
glass. 25 Nor were the German ironworkers anywhere surpassed in this
age; at Augsburg, Ebrach, and elsewhere they made wrought-iron gates
rivaling those that Jean La- mour was raising at Nancy. The German
goldsmiths were excelled only by the very best in Paris. German
engravers (Knobelsdorff, Glume, Rugendas, Ridinger, Georg Kilian, Georg
Schmidt) cut or burned exquisite designs into copper plates. 26</p>
<p>German painters in this period did not win the international renown
still awarded to Watteau, Boucher, La Tour, and Chardin. It is part of
our unavoid- able parochialism that non-Germans are not acquainted with
the paintings of Cosmas Asam, Balthasar Denner, Johann Fiedler, Johann
Thiele, Johann Ziese- nis, Georg de Marees; let us at least recite their
names. Better known to us than</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GERMANY OF BACH 405</p>
<p>hese is a French artist domiciled in Germany, Antoine Pesne, who
became court painter to Frederick William I and Frederick the Great. His
masterpiece pictures Frederick as a still innocent child of three, with
his six-year-old sister Wilhelmine; 27 if this had been painted in Paris
all the world would have heard of it.</p>
<p>One family garnered fame in three fields — painting, sculpture, and
architec- ture. Cosmas Damian Asam, in the Church of St. Emmeram in
Regensburg, pic- tured the assumption of St. Benedict into Paradise,
giving him the help of a lofty launching pad. Cosmas joined his brother
Egid in designing the interior of the Church of St. Nepomuk in Munich —
architecture overlaid with sculpture in wildest baroque. Egid carved in
stucco The Assumption of Mary for an abbey church at Rohr in Bavaria. A
fine Italian hand showed in the imposing Neptune Fountain set up in
Dresden by Lorenzo Mattielli; this was a famous feature in the splendor
of the Saxon capital. Balthasar Permoser spoiled his sculptured
Apotheosis of Prince Eugene 28 with a confusion of symbolical figures;
he dec- orated with a like extravagance the pavilion of the Dresden
Zwinger; he achieved an almost Michelangelic dignity and force in the
Apostles grouped around the pulpit of the Hofkirche in Dresden; and his
linden-wood St. Am- brose in that church ranks near the top of European
sculpture in the first half of the eighteenth century. Georg Ebenhecht
imagined a slim German beauty in the lovely Bacchus and Ariadne that he
carved for the park at Sanssouci. German parks and gardens abounded in
sculpture; a connoisseur of baroque estimated that “there is a bigger
proportion of good garden statues in Germany than in the whole of the
rest of Europe put together.” 29</p>
<p>But it was only in architecture that German artists caught the eye of
European artists in this age. Johann Balthasar Neumann left his mark in
a dozen places. His masterpiece was the Residenz of the Prince-Bishop of
Wurzburg; others collaborated in the design and execution (1719-44), but
his was the guiding hand. The Venetian Room and the Mirror Room, re-
splendent in their decoration, were shattered in the Second World War,
but four rooms remain to attest the splendor of the interior; and the
lordly staircase, known to all the art world for its ceiling frescoes by
Tiepolo, was one of several such structures that helped to give Neumann
his^ pre- eminence among the architects of his time. Quite different,
but almost as fine, was the staircase he built for the episcopal palace
in Bruchsal — another casualty of the national suicide. Perhaps more
beautiful than either was the double staircase made by him for the
Augustusburg at Briihl, near Cologne. Staircases were his passion; he
lavished his art on still another in a monastery at Ebrach. Interrupting
his ascents and descents, he built the Wallfahrts - kirche (pilgrimage
church) of Vierzehnheiligen on the Main; he decorated in ornate baroque
the Paulinuskirche in Trier and the Kreuzbergkirche near Bonn; and to
the cathedral at Wurzburg he added a chapel whose exterior is as nearly
perfect as baroque can be.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical architecture now specialized in massive monasteries.
The Kloster Ettal, a Benedictine cloister which Emperor Louis of
Bavaria</p>
<p>founded in 1 330 in a picturesque valley near Oberammergau, was
restored in 1 7 1 8 by Enrico Zuccalli, and was crowned with a graceful
dome. The abbey church was destroyed by fire in 1744; it was rebuilt in
1752 by Josef Schmuzer; the interior was elaborately adorned in
gold-and-white rococo style, with frescoes by Johann Zeiller and Martin
Knoller; sumptuous side altars were added in 1757, and an organ
celebrated for its handsome case. The most impressive of these prayerful
monuments is the incredibly rich Kloster kirche, or cloister church, of
the Benedictine monastery at Otto- beuren, southeast of Memmingen. Here
Johann Michael Fischer organized the ensemble, Johann Christian
contributed the gilt carvings, and Martin Hormann provided the choir
stalls — the pride of German wood carving in this century. Fischer
worked intermittently on this enterprise from 1737 till his death in
1766.</p>
<p>The ruling classes were as loath as the monks to wait for a heaven
beyond the grave. Some stately town halls were erected, as at Liineburg
and Bam- berg; but the major efforts of secular architecture were
devoted to castles and palaces. Karlsruhe had, as Residenz of the
Margrave of Baden-Durlach, a unique Schloss in the shape of a fan — the
ribs radiating out from a garden handle into the city streets. This
palace, like much of the city, was laid in ruins by the Second World
War; the great Schloss Berlin, built by Andreas Schliiter and his
successors (1699-1720), fell in the same tragedy; still an- other victim
was the Schloss Monbijou, near the Spandau Gate of Berlin; the castle at
Briihl, designed for the Archbishop of Cologne, was partly destroyed;
the Schloss Bruchsal was a total loss. At Munich Josef Effner raised the
Preysing Palace, and at Trier Johann Seitz housed the ruling Archbishop
in the Kurfiirstliches Palais (Electoral Palace) — a model of modest
beauty. For the Bishop-Elector of Mainz Maximilian von Welsch and Johann
Dientzenhofer put up near Pommersfelden another great castle, the
Schloss Weissenstein, in which Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt installed a
famous double staircase where dignitaries could go up and down without
collision.</p>
<p>Frederick the Great capped the secular architecture of Germany in the
eighteenth century by commissioning Georg von Knobelsdorff and others to
build at Potsdam (sixteen miles out of Berlin), on a design laid out by
the King himself, three palaces that in their ensemble almost rivaled
Ver- sailles: the Stadtschloss, or State House ( 1 745-5 1 ) , the Neues
Palais (1755), and Frederick’s summer residence, which he spelled
“Schloss Sanssouci.” From the River Havel a broad avenue of gently
rising steps led in five stages through a terraced park to this “Castle
without Care,” whose mul - lioned windows and central dome took some
hints from Dresden’s Zwinger</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THE GERMANY OF BACH 407</p>
<p>Palace. One wing contained an extensive art gallery; under the dome
ran a circle of handsome Corinthian columns; and a Bibliothek adorned
with rococo scrollwork and gleaming with glass-enclosed books offered a
retreat from politics and generals. It was chiefly in Sanssouci that
Voltaire met his match in the philosopher-king who could govern a state,
defy the church, design a building, sketch a portrait, write passable
poetry and excellent his- tory, win a war against half of Europe,
compose music, conduct an orches- tra, and play the flute.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>GERMAN MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>From the birth of Handel and Bach in 1685 to the death of Brahms in
1897 German music was supreme; at any time in those 212 years the
greatest living composer, except in opera, was a German. 30 Two musical
forms, the oratorio and the fugue, attained their highest development in
the work of Germans in the first half of the eighteenth century; and
some would add that the Roman Catholic Mass received its final
expression at the hands of a German Protestant. The age of painting
ended; the age of music began.</p>
<p>Music was part of the religion, as religion was so great a part of
music, in every German home. There was hardly a family, except in the
poorest class, that could not sing part song, hardly an individual who
could not play one or more instruments. Hundreds of amateur groups
called Liebhaber performed cantatas that professional singers now
consider discouragingly difficult. 31 Manuals of music were as popular
as the Bible. Music was taught with reading and writing in the common
schools. Musical criticism was further advanced than in any other
country but Italy, and the leading musi- cal critic of the century was a
German.</p>
<p>Johann Mattheson was probably more famous and unpopular among Ger-
man musicians than any German composer. His vanity clouded his achieve-
ments. He knew the classical and the modern literary languages, he wrote
on law and politics, he played the organ and the harpsichord so well
that he could turn down a dozen invitations to exalted posts. He was an
elegant dancer, an accomplished man of the world. He was an expert
fencer, who nearly killed Handel in a duel. He sang successfully in the
Hamburg Opera; composed operas, cantatas, Passions, oratorios, sonatas,
and suites; and de- veloped the cantata form before Bach. For nine years
he served as Kapell- meister for the Duke of Holstein; then, becoming
deaf, he resigned himself to writing. He published eighty-eight books,
eight of them on music, and added a treatise on tobacco. He founded and
edited (1722-25) Critica mu- sica, the earliest known critical
discussion of past and current compositions,</p>
<p>408</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>and compiled a biographical dictionary of contemporary musicians. He
died at eighty-three (1764), having powerfully stimulated the musical
world.</p>
<p>Musical instruments were in continuous evolution and change, but the
organ was still their unchallenged chief. Usually it had three or four
manu- als or keyboards, plus a pedal board of two and a half octaves,
plus a variety of stops that could imitate almost any other instrument.
No finer organs have been built than those made by Andreas Silbermann of
Strasbourg and Gottfried Silbermann of Freiberg. But string instruments
were mounting in popularity. The clavichord (that is, key and string)
used a manual of keys to manipulate levers armed with little “tangents”
of brass to strike the strings; this instrument was already three
centuries old, perhaps more. In the harpsichord (which the French called
clavecin, and the Italians clavi- or gravicembalo ) the strings were
plucked by a tongue of quill or leather at- tached to levers moved by
(usually) a double manual of keys, aided by two pedals and three or four
stops. The term clavier was applied in Germany to any keyboard
instrument — clavichord, harpsichord, or piano — and to the manuals of
an organ. The harpsichord was essentially a harp in which the fingers
plucked the strings through the media of keys, levers, and plectra. It
produced sounds of a delicate charm, but since the plectrum rebounded as
soon as it had struck the string, this instrument had no means of
holding a note or varying its intensity. To get two degrees of tone it
had to resort to a double manual — the upper one for piano (soft), the
lower for forte (loud). The pianoforte grew out of efforts to overcome
these limitations.</p>
<p>In or before 1709 Bartolommeo Cristofori made at Florence four gravi-
cembali col piano e forte — “clavichords with soft and loud.” In these
the plucking plectrum was replaced by a little leather hammer whose
contact with the string could be continued by keeping the key depressed,
while the loudness of the note could be determined by the force with
which the finger struck the key. In 17 1 1 Scipione di Maffei described
the new instru- ment in his Giornale dei letter ati d’ Italia; in 1725
this essay appeared at Dres - den in a German version; in 1726 Gottfried
Silbermann, inspired by this translation, 32 built two pianofortes on
Cristofori’s principles. About 1733 he showed an improved model to
Johann Sebastian Bach, who pronounced it too weak in the upper register,
and requiring too heavy a touch. Silber- mann admitted these defects and
labored to remove them. He succeeded so well that Frederick the Great
bought fifteen of his pianofortes. Bach played one of these when he
visitecf Frederick in 1747; he liked it, but judged him- self too old to
adopt the new instrument; he continued through his remain- ing three
years to prefer the organ and the harpsichord.</p>
<p>The orchestra was used mainly in the service of opera or choir; music
was seldom composed for it alone except in the form of overtures.
Oboes</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GERMANY OF BACH 409</p>
<p>and bassoons were more numerous than in our orchestras today; the
wood- winds dominated the strings. Public concerts were as yet rare in
Germany; music was almost entirely confined to the church, the opera,
the home, or the streets. Semipublic concerts of chamber music were
given in Leipzig from 1743 in the homes of prosperous merchants; larger
and larger quarters were taken, the performers were increased to
sixteen, and in 1 746 a Leipzig directory announced that “on Thursdays a
Collegium Musicum, under the direction of the worshipful Company of
Merchants and other persons, is held from five to eight o’clock at the
Three Swans [an inn]”; these con - certs, it added, “are fashionably
frequented, and are admired wi th much attention.” 33 From this
Collegium Musicum evolved in 1781 the Grosses Konzert in the Leipzig
Gewandhaus (Drapers’ Hall)— the oldest concert series now in
existence.</p>
<p>Only a small minority of musical compositions were written for
instru- ments alone; but some of these productions shared in developing
the sym- phony. At Mannheim a school of composers and performers — many
of them from Austria, Italy, or Bohemia — took a leading part in this
development. There the Elector Palatine Charles Theodore (r. 173 3-99) ,
a patron of all the arts, gathered an orchestra that was generally
reputed to be the best in Europe. For that group Johann Stamitz, a
virtuoso of the violin, composed true symphonies: orchestral
compositions divided into three or more move- ments, of which at least
the first followed “sonata form”— exposition of con- trasted themes,
their “free elaboration,” and their recapitulation. Following the lead
of Neapolitan composers, the new form took normally the se- quence of
fast, slow, and fast movements — allegro, andante, allegro; and from the
dance it sometimes added a minuet. So the age of polyphonic music, based
on one motif and culminating in J. S. Bach, passed into the symphonic
age of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.</p>
<p>The human voice remained the most magical of instruments. Karl
Philipp Emanuel Bach, Karl Heinrich Graun, and others put to music the
passionate love poems of Johann Christian Gunther; and Johann Ernst Bach
of Wei- mar found inspiration for several fine lieder in the poetry of
Christian Gel- lert. Opera flourished in Germany now, but it was
predominantly Italian in form, importing its compositions and singers
from Italy. Every major court had its opera hall, usually open only to
the elite. Hamburg, controlled by its merchants, was an exception: it
offered German opera, opened the performances to the paying public, and
recruited its divas from the market place. In Hamburg Reinhard Keiser
ruled the Gansemarkt (Goosemarket) Theater for forty years. During his
reign he composed 1 16 operas, mostly Italian in text and style, but
some of them German. For in 1728 Mattheson’s Musikalischer Patriot
raised a battle cry against the Italian invaders: “ Out, barbarians!
[Fuori barbari! ] Let the [operatic] calling be forbidden to the</p>
<p>410</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>aliens who encompass us from east to west; let them be sent back
again across their savage Alps to purify themselves in the furnace of
Etna!” 34 But the lure of Italian voices and melodies proved
irresistible. Even in Hamburg the rage for Neapolitan operas stifled
native productions. Keiser surren- dered and moved to Copenhagen; the
Hamburg theater closed in 1739 after sixty years of existence; and when
it reopened in 1741 it was frankly devoted to Italian opera. When
Frederick restored opera to Berlin (1742), he chose German composers but
Italian performers. “A German singer!” he exclaimed. “I would as soon
hear my horse neigh.” 35</p>
<p>Germany produced in this age one operatic composer of the first rank,
Johann Adolf Hasse, but he too wooed Italy. For ten year^ he studied
there with Alessandro Scarlatti and Niccolo Porpora; he married the
Italian singer Faustina Bordoni (1730); he wrote the music for Italian
librettos by Apos- tolo Zeno, Metastasio, and others. His early operas
were so enthusiastically received in Naples and Venice that Italy called
him u il caro Sass one,” the lovable Saxon. When he returned to Germany
he passionately defended Italian opera. Most Germans agreed with him,
and honored him above the absent Handel and far above the obscure Bach;
Burney ranked him and Gluck as the Raphael and Michelangelo of music in
German lands. 36 No one, not even the Italians, equaled the richness of
his hundred operas in melodic or dramatic invention. In 1731 he and his
wife, the greatest diva of her time, were invited to Dresden by Augustus
the Strong; Faustina cap- tured the capital with her voice, Hasse with
his compositions. In 1760 be lost most of his property, including his
collected manuscripts, in the bom- bardment of Dresden by Frederick the
Great. The ruined city gave up opera, and Hasse and his wife moved to
Vienna, where, by now seventy- four, he competed with Gluck. In 1771, at
the marriage of the Archduke Ferdinand in Milan, he shared the musical
program with the fourteen-year- old Mozart. “This boy,” he is reported
to have said, “will throw us all into the shade.” 37 Soon afterward he
and Faustina went to spend their remain - ing years in Venice. There
they both died in 1783, he aged eighty-four, she ninety. The harmony of
their lives surpassed the melody of their songs. While Italian music
triumphed in tbe opera houses of Germany, church music flourished
despite Frederick’s ridicule of it as “old - fashioned” and “debased.”
38 We shall see Catholic music prospering in Vienna; and in the north
the surviving fervor of Protestantism inspired a multitude of cantatas,
chorales, and Passions, as if a hundred composers were preparing the way
and the forms for Bach. Organ music predominated, but many church or-
chestras included violins and violoncellos. The influence of opera
appeared not only in the enlargement of church orchestras and choirs,
but also in the increasingly dramatic character of church
compositions.</p>
<p>The most famous composer of religious music in Bach’s Germany was</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THE GERMANY OF BACH 411</p>
<p>Georg Philipp Telemann, who was born four years before Bach ( 1 68 1
) and died seventeen years after him (1767). Mattheson considered
Telemann su- perior to all his German contemporaries in musical
composition; Bach, with one exception, may have agreed, for he
transcribed whole cantatas by his rival. Telemann was a child prodigy.
At an early age he learned Latin and Greek, the violin and the flute; at
eleven he began to compose; at twelve he wrote an opera, which was
performed in a theater with himself singing one of the roles. At twelve
he composed a cantata, and conducted it stand- ing on a bench so that
the players could see him.</p>
<p>He grew into a robust and jolly Teuton, bubbling with humor and mel-
ody. In 1701, passing through Halle, he met the sixteen-year-old Handel,
and loved him at first sight. He went on to Leipzig to study law, but
re- lapsed into music as organist for the Neuekirche (1704). A year
later he ac- cepted the post of Kapellmeister in Sorau; then to
Eisenach, where he met Bach; in 17 14 he served as godfather to Johann
Sebastian’s son Karl Philipp Emanuel. In 1 7 1 1 his young wife died,
taking his heart with her, he said; but three years later he married
again. In 1721 he advanced to Hamburg, where he served as Kapellmeister
for six churches, directed musical instruc- tion in the Gymnasium , took
charge of the Hamburg Opera, edited a jour- nal of music, and organized
a series of public concerts which continued into our own time.
Everything prospered with Telemann, except that his wife preferred
Swedish officers.</p>
<p>His productivity rivaled any man’s in that age of musical giants. For
all the Sundays and feast days of thirty-nine years he composed sacred
music — Passions, cantatas, oratorios, anthems and motets; he added
operas, comic operas, concertos, trios, serenades; Handel said that
Telemann could com- pose a motet in eight parts as quickly as one writes
a letter. 39 He took his style from France, as Hasse took his from
Italy, but he added his own pe- culiar verve. In 1765, aged eighty-four,
he wrote a cantata, Ino, which Ro- main Rolland thought equal to the
similar productions of Handel, Gluck, and Beethoven. But Telemann was
the victim of his own fertility. He com- posed too rapidly for
perfection, and did not have the patience to revise, or the courage to
destroy, the imperfect products of his genius; a critic accused him of
“incredible immoderation.” 40 Today he is almost forgotten; but now and
then he comes to us as a disembodied spirit through the air, and we find
all his resurrected utterances beautiful. 41</p>
<p>Frederick was not alone in preferring Karl Heinrich Graun to Telemann
and Bach. Karl first reached fame by his soprano voice; this failing, he
turned to composition, and at the age of fifteen he wrote a Grosse
Passions- kantata (1716) which was performed in the Kreuzschule at
Dresden. After a period as Kapellmeister at Brunswick he was engaged by
Frederick (1735) to direct music at Rheinsberg. He continued during his
remaining fourteen</p>
<p>4 12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>years to serve the Prussian court, for even his religious music
pleased the skeptical King. Der T od Jesu, a Passion first performed in
the Berlin cathe- dral in 1755, achieved a renown in Germany rivaled
only by that of Han- del’s Messiah in England and Ireland; it was
repeated annually in Holy Week till our own time. All Protestant Germany
joined Frederick in</p>
<p>mourning Graun’s comparatively early death.</p>
<p>Meanwhile half a hundred Bachs had laid the seed and scene for their
most famous heir. Johann Sebastian himself drew up his family tree in
Ur- sprung der musikalisch Bachischen Familie, which reached print in
1917; the meticulous Spitta has devoted 180 pages to charting that
Orphean stream. The towns of Thuringia were sprinkled with Bachs,
traceable as far back as</p>
<ol start="1509" type="1">
<li>The oldest musikalischer Bach, with whom Johann Sebastian began his
list, was his great-great-grandfather Veit Bach (d. 1619). From him de-
scended four lines of Bachs, many of them prominent as musicians; these
were so numerous that they formed a kind of guild, which met
periodically to exchange notes. One of them, Johann Ambrosius Bach,
received from his father the violin technique which he transmitted to
his children. In 1671 he succeeded his cousin as Hofmusikus, court
musician, at Eisenach. In 1668 he had married Elisabeth Lammerhirt,
daughter of a furrier who became a town councilor. By her he had two
daughters and six sons. The oldest son, Johann Christoph Bach, rose to
be organist at Ohrdruf. Another, Johann Jakob Bach, joined the Swedish
army as oboist. The youngest was</li>

<p>V. JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH: 1685-1750</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Chronology</li>
</ol>
<p>He was born on March 21, 1685, at Eisenach, in the duchy of Saxe-</p>
<p>Weimar. In the Cottahaus on the Lutherplatz the great reformer had
lived as a boy; on a hill overlooking the town stood the Wartburg, the
castle where Luther hid from Charles V (1521) and translated the New
Testa- ment; Bach’s works are the Reformation put to music.</p>
<p>His mother died when he was nine; his father died eight months later;
Johann Sebastian and his brother Johann Jakob were taken into the family
of their brother Johann Christoph. In the Gymnasium at Eisenach
Sebastian learned much catechism and some Latin; in the Lyceum at
neighboring Ohrdruf he studied Latin, Greek, history, and music. He
stood high in his classes, and was rapidly advanced. His father had
taught him the violin, his brother Christoph taught him the clavier. He
took eagerly to these musi- cal studies, as if music ran in his blood.
He copied note for note a large</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GERMANY OF BACH 413</p>
<p>number of musical compositions not regulary available to him; so,
some think, began the impairment of his sight.</p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, to relieve the pressure on Johann Christoph’s
grow - ing family, Sebastian set forth to earn his own living. He found
employment as a soprano singer in the school of the Convent of
St. Michael at Liine- burg; when his voice changed he was kept as a
violinist in the orchestra. From Liineburg he visited Hamburg,
twenty-eight miles away, perhaps to attend the opera, certainly to hear
the recitals of Johann Adam Reinken, the seventy-seven-year-old organist
of the Katharinenkirche. Opera did not attract him, but the art of the
organ appealed to his robust spirit; in that towering instrument he felt
a challenge to all his energy and skill. By 1703 he was already so
accomplished that the Neuekirche at Arnstadt (near Er- furt) engaged him
to play, three times a week, the great organ recently in- stalled there,
which continued in service till 1 863. Free to use the instrument for
his studies, he now composed his first significant works.</p>
<p>Ambition kept him always alert to improve his art. He knew that at
Lii- beck, fifty miles away, the most renowned organist in Germany,
Dietrich Buxtehude, would give a series of recitals between Martinmas
and Christ- mas in the Marienkirche. He asked his church’s consistory
for a month’s leave of absence; it was granted; he delegated his duties
and fees to his cou- sin Johann Ernst, and set out on foot (October,
1705) for Liibeck. We have seen Handel and Mattheson making a similar
pilgrimage. Bach was not tempted to marry Buxtehude’s daughter as the
price of inheriting his post; he wanted only to study the master’s org
an technique. This or something else must have fascinated him, for he
did not get back to Arnstadt till the middle of February. On February
21, 1706, the consistory reproved him for extending his leave, and for
introducing “many wunderliche variations” in his preludes to the
congregational hymns. On November 1 1 he was ad- monished for failure to
train the choir adequately, and for privately allow- ing “a stranger
maiden to sing in the church.” (Women were not yet</p>
<p>permitted to sing in church.) The alien lass was Maria Barbara Bach,
his cousin. He made what excuses he could, but in June, 1707, he
resigned, and accepted the post of organist in the Church of St. Blasius
at Miihlhausen. His yearly salary, exceptionally good for the time and
place, was to be eighty- five gulden, thirteen bushels of corn, two
cords of wood, six trusses of brushwood, and three pounds of fish. 42 On
October 17 he made Maria Bar- bara his wife.</p>
<p>But Miihlhausen proved as uncomfortable as Arnstadt. Part of the city
had burned down; the harassed citizens were in no mood for wonderful
variations; the congregation was torn between orthodox Lutherans who
loved to sing and Pietists who thought that music was next to
godlessness.</p>
<p>4H THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>The choir was in chaos, and Bach could transform chaos into order
only with notes, not with men. When he received an invitation to become
or- ganist and director of the orchestra at the court of Duke Wilhelm
Ernst of Saxe-Weimar he humbly begged his Miihlhausen employers to
dismiss him. 43 In June, 1 708, he moved to his new post.</p>
<p>At Weimar he was well paid — 156 gulden a year, raised to 225 in
1713; now he could feed the brood that Maria Barbara was hatching. He
was not quite content, for he was subordinate to a Kapellmeister, Johann
Drese; but he profited from the friendship of Johann Gottfried Walther,
organist in the town church, author of the first German dictionary of
music (1732), and composer of chorales hardly inferior to Bach’s.
Perhaps through the learned Walther he undertook now a careful study of
French and Italian music. He liked Frescobaldi and Corelli, but was
especially charmed by the violin concertos of Vivaldi; he transcribed
nine of these for other instru- ments. Sometimes he incorporated bits of
the transcriptions into his own compositions. We can feel the influence
of Vivaldi in the Brandenburg Con- certos, but we feel in them, too, a
deeper spirit and richer art.</p>
<p>His chief duty at Weimar was to serve as organist in the
Schlosskirche, or Castle Church. There he had at his disposal an organ
small but fully equipped. For that instrument he composed many of his
greatest organ pieces: the Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor, the best of
the toccatas, most of the major preludes and fugues, and the
Orgelbuchlein, or Little Book for the Organ. His fame thus far was as an
organist, not as a composer. Observers, including the critical
Mattheson, marveled at his agility with keys, pedals, and stops; one
declared that Bach’s feet “flew over the pedal board as if they had
wings.” 44 He was invited to perform in Halle, Cassel, and other cities.
At Cassel (1714) the future Frederick I of Sweden was so impressed that
he took from his finger a diamond ring and gave it to Bach. In 1717, at
Dresden, Bach met Jean Louis Marchand, who as organist to Louis XV had
achieved an international renown. Someone proposed a contest between the
two. They agreed to meet in the home of Count von Flemming; each was to
play at sight any organ composition placed before him. Bach appeared at
the appointed hour; Marchand, for reasons now un- known, left Dresden
before that time, giving Bach an unpleasant victory by default.</p>
<p>Despite his industry and his growing fame, he was passed over when
the Weimar Kapellmeister died; the office was transmitted to the dead
man’s son. Bach was in a mood to try another court. Prince Leopold of
Anhalt- Cothen offered him the post of Kapellmeister. The new Duke of
Saxe- Weimar, Wilhelm Augustus, refused to let his organist go; Bach
insisted; the Duke imprisoned him (April 6, 1717); Bach persisted; the
Duke re- leased him (December 2); Bach hurried with his family to
Cothen. As</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GERMANY OF BACH 415</p>
<p>Prince Leopold was a Calvinist, and disapproved of church music,
Bach’s function was to direct the court orchestra, in which the Prince
himself played the viola da gamba. Consequently it was in this period
(1717-23) that Bach composed much of his chamber music, including the
French and English suites. In 1721 he dispatched to Margrave Christian
Ludwig of Brandenburg the concertos that bear that name.</p>
<p>Those were mostly happy years, for Prince Leopold loved him, took him
along on various journeys, proudly displayed Bach’s talent, and remained
his friend when history parted their ways. But on July 7, 1720, Maria
Barbara died, after giving Bach seven children, of whom four survived.
He mourned her for seventeen months; then he took as his second wife
Anna Magdalena Wulcken, daughter of a trumpeter in his orchestra. He was
now thirty-six, she was only twenty; yet she acquitted herself well of
the task assigned to her — to be a faithful mother to his children.
Moreover she knew music, aided him in his composition, copied his
manuscripts, and sang for him in what he called “a very clear soprano.”
45 She bore him thirteen children, but seven died before reaching the
age of five; there were many heartbreaks in that wonderful family. As
his children grew in number and years, the problem of their education
disturbed him. He was a hearty Lutheran; he disliked the gloomy
Calvinism that reigned in Cothen; he refused to send his offspring to
the local school, which taught the Calvinist creed. Besides, his beloved
Prince married (1721) a young princess whose demands upon Leopold
lessened his interest in music. Once again Bach thought it time for a
change. He was a restless spirit, but his restlessness made him; if he
had remained at Cothen we should never have heard of him.</p>
<p>In June, 1722, Johann Kuhnau died, after filling for twenty years the
post of cantor in the Thomasschule at Leipzig. This was a public school
with seven grades and eight teachers, giving instruction especially in
Latin, music, and Lutheran theology. The students and graduates, under
the di- rection of the cantor, were expected to provide the music for
the churches of the city. The cantor was subject to the rector of the
school and to the municipal council, which paid the salaries.</p>
<p>The council asked Telemann to take the vacated post, for it favored
the Italian style which characterized Telemann’s compositions, but Tel
emann declined. It then offered the place to Christoph Graupner,
Kappellmeister at Darmstadt, but Graupner’s employer refused to release
him from his con - tract. On February 7, 1723, Bach presented himself as
a candidate, and sub- mitted to various tests of his competence. No one
doubted his ability as an organist, but some members of the council
thought the style of his compo- sitions unduly conservative. 46 One
proposed that “as the best musicians are not available, we must take a
man of moderate a bility.” 47 Bach was engaged (April 22, 1723) on
condition that he would teach Latin as well as music,</p>
<p>41 6 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>hat he would lead a modest and retired ( eingezogen ) life, subscribe
to the Lutheran doctrine, show the council “all due respect and
obedience,” and never leave the city without the burgomaster’s
permission. On May 30 he was installed with his family in the
residential wing of the school, and be- gan his official tasks. He
stayed at that burdensome post till his death.</p>
<p>Henceforth most of his compositions, except the Mass in B Minor, were
composed for use in the two main churches of Leipzig — St. Thomas’ and
St. Nicholas’. Church services on Sunday began at 7 a.m. with an orga n
prelude; then the minister intoned the Introit, the choir sang the
Kyrie, the minister and the choir — and sometimes the congregation —
sang the Gloria in German, the worshipers sang a hymn, the minister
chanted the Gospel and the Credo, the organist “preludized,” the choir
sang a cantata, the con - gregation sang the hymn “Wir glauben all’ in
einem Gott” (We All Be - lieve in One God) ; the minister preached for
an hour, prayed, and blessed; there followed Holy Communion, and another
hymn. This service con- cluded at ten in winter, at eleven in summer. At
eleven the students and faculty ate dinner in the school. At 1:15 p.m.
the choir returned to the church for vespers, prayers, hymns, a sermon,
and the German form of the Magnificat. On Good Friday the choir sang the
Passion. To perform the music for all these services Bach trained two
choirs, each of some twelve members, and an orchestra of some eighteen
pieces. Soloists were part of the choir, and sang with it before and
after their arias and recitatives.</p>
<p>For his complex services at Leipzig Bach received a salary
averaging</p>
<p>seven hundred thalers per year. This included his share of the
students’ tuition fees, and his honorariums for providing music at
weddings and funerals. The year 1729, which gave us The Passion
according to St. Mat- thew, was reckoned by Bach as a bad year, for the
weather was so good that there was a dearth of deaths. 48 Occasionally
he earned some extra tha- lers by conducting public concerts for the
Collegium Musicum. He tried to improve his income by claiming control
over the music in the Pauliner- kirche attached to the University of
Leipzig; some competitors objected, and for two years he carried on a
controversy with the university authori- ties, achieving at last a
compromise unsatisfactory to everybody concerned.</p>
<p>He fought another long battle with the municipal council, which ap-
pointed students to the Thomasschule; the councilors tended to send him
scholars chosen through political influence rather than for musical
capacity; he could make neither treble nor bass out of such newcomers,
and on Au- gust 23, 1730, he lodged a formal protest with the council.
It retorted that he was an incompetent teacher and a poor
disciplinarian, that he lost his temper in scolding the students, that
disorder was rife in the choirs and the school. 49 Bach wrote to a
friend at Liineburg for help in finding another post. None being open to
him, he appealed (July 27, 1733) to Augustus</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>417</p>
<p>III, the new King of Poland, to give him a court position and title
that might shield him from the “undeserved affronts” that he received.
Augustus took three years to comply; finally (November 19, 1736) he
conferred upon Bach the title of koniglicher Hof komponist — composer
for the royal court. Meanwhile the new director of the Tomasschule,
Johann August Ernesti, contested with Bach the right to appoint,
discipline, and flog the choir prefects. The dispute dragged on for
months; Bach twice ejected Ernesti’s appointee from the organ gallery;
at last the King confirmed Bach’s authority.</p>
<p>So his life as cantor in Leipzig was not a happy one. His spirit and
energy were absorbed in his compositions and their performance; little
remained for pedagogy or diplomacy. He found some consolation in his
spreading fame as composer and organist. He accepted invitations to play
at Weimar, Cassel, Naumburg, and Dresden; he received fees for these
incidental per- formances, and for testing organs. In 1740 his son Karl
Philipp Emanuel was engaged as cembalist in the chapel orchestra of
Frederick the Great; in 1741 Bach visited Berlin; in 1747 Frederick
invited him to come and try the pianofortes recently bought from
Gottfried Silbermann. The King was astonished by “old Bach’s”
improvisations; he challenged him to extempo - rize a fugue in six
parts, and was delighted with the response. Returning to Leipzig, Bach
composed a trio for flute, violin, and clavier, and sent it, with some
other pieces, as a Musical Offering — Musikalisches Opfer — dedicated to
the royal flutist as “a sovereign admired in music as in all other
sciences of war and peace.” 50 Aside from such exciting interludes, he
gave himself with exhausting devotion to his duties as cantor, to his
love for his wife and children, and to the expression of his art and
soul in his works.</p>

<p>How shall we be excused for venturing, without professional compe-
tence, to survey the magnitude and variety of Bach’s production? Nothing
is possible here except a catalogue graced with affection.</p>
<p>First of all, then, the organ works, for the organ remained his
abiding love; there he was unmatched except by Handel, who was lost
beyond the seas. Sometimes Bach would pull out all its stops, just to
test its lungs and feel its power. On it he disported himself as with an
instrument completely under his control, subject to all his fantasies.
But in his imperious fashion he set a limit to the willfulness of
performers by specifying, through under- lying numerals, the chords to
be used with the written bass notes; this is the “figured” or “thorough”
bass that indicated the continuo by which the</p>
<p>418 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>organ or harpsichord should accompany other instruments or the
voice.</p>
<p>During his stay at Weimar Bach prepared for his oldest son and other
students a “little organ book”— Orgelbiichlem — composed of forty-five
chorale preludes and dedicated “to the Highest God alone for His honor,
and to my neighbor that he may teach himself thereby.” The function of a
chorale prelude was to serve as an instrumental preface to a congrega-
tional hymn, to outline its theme and set its mood. The preludes were
ar- ranged to form fit sequences for Christmas, Passion JiVeek, and
Easter; these events of the ecclesiastical year remained to the end the
proccupation of Bach’s organ and vocal music. And here at the outset, in
the chorale “Alle Menschen miissen sterben”— All Men Must Die — we meet
one of Bach’s recurrent subjects, always tempered with the resolution to
face death with faith in Christ’s resurrecti on as a promise of our own.
Years later we shall hear the same note in the somber chorale “Komm,
siisser Tod”— Come, Sweet Death. Along with this enveloping piety there
is in these prel- udes, and generally in Bach’s instrumental
compositions, a healthy humor; sometimes he runs friskily over the keys
in a merriment of variations that recalls the complaints of the Arnstadt
Consistory.</p>
<p>Altogether Bach left 143 chorale preludes, which students of music
rank the most characteristic and technically perfect of his works. They
are his lyrics, as the Masses and Passions are his epics. He ran the
gamut of musical forms, omitting opera as alien to his place, his
temperament, and his con- ception of music as primarily an offering to
God. To give his art freer range he added a fugue to the prelude,
letting a theme in the bass run after the same theme in the treble, or
vice versa, in an intricate game that delighted his contrapuntal soul.
So the Prelude and Fugue in E Minor begins with inviting simplicity,
then soars to an almost frightening complexity of rich- ness and power.
The Prelude and Fugue in D Minor is already Bach at his best in
structure, technical workmanship, thematic development, imagina- tive
exuberance, and massive force. Perhaps finer still is the Passacaglia
and Fugue in C Minor. The Spaniards gave the name pasacalle to a tune
played by a musician “passing along a street”; in Italy it became a
dance form; in Bach it is a majestic flow of harmony, at once simple,
meditative, and profound.</p>
<p>For the organ or the clavichord Bach wrote a dozen toccatas — i.e.,
pieces that could exercise the “touch” of a performer. Usually they
included rapid runs over the keyboard, brave fortissimi, delicate
pianissimi, and a fugue of notes playfully treading upon one another’s
heels. In this group the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor has won the widest
audience, partly</p>
<p>hrough orchestral transcriptions more congenial than the organ to the
modern unecclesiastical ear. Of the seven toccatas for clavichord or
harpsi- chord, the Toccata in C Minor is again Bach in all his confident
mastery</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GERMANY OF BACH 419</p>
<p>of technique — a frolic of counterpoint followed by an adagio of
serene and stately loveliness.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us, with underprivileged fingers and
half-illiterate ears, to appreciate the pleasure that Bach took and gave
in his compositions for the clavier — which for him usually meant the
clavichord. First of all, we should have to understand the principles of
structure that he followed in developing a few notes of theme or motive
into a complex but orderly elaboration — like the arabesque which, in a
Persian carpet or a mosque mihrab, wanders from its base in seeming
abandon, yet always with a logic that adds an intellectual satisfaction
to the sensual enjoyment of the form. And again, we should have to
borrow Bach’s manual magic, for he invented a playing technique that
called for the full use of all the fingers (including the thumb) of each
hand, whereas his predecessors had seldom used or required more than the
middle three in their compositions for the clavier. Even in the position
of the hand he caused a revolution. Players had tended to keep the hand
flat in striking the keys; Bach taught his pupils to curve the hand, so
that all the finger tips would strike the keys at the same level.
Without that technique Liszt would have been impossible.</p>
<p>Finally, adopting a system proposed by Andreas Werckmeister in 1691,
Bach demanded that the strings in the instruments be tuned to equal “tem
- perament”— i.e., that the octave be divided into twelve exactly equal
semi- tones, so that no dissonance might occur in modulation. In many
cases he insisted on himself tuning the clavichord that he was to play.
51 So he wrote Das wohltemperirte Klavier, or The Well-tempered
[properly tuned] Clavichord (Part I, 1722; Part II, 1744): forty-eight
preludes and fugues — two for each major and minor key — “for the use
and prac tice of young musicians who desire to learn, as well as for
those who are already skilled in this study, by way of amusement,” as
the original title read. The pieces are of great technical interest to
musicians, but many of them, too, can convey to us Bach’s gay caprice or
meditative feeling; so Gounod adopted the Prelude in C Major, in a
corrupted form, as the obbligato for his “Ave Maria.” Some profound
spirits, like Albert Schweitzer, have found in these preludes and fugues
a “world of peace” amid the turmoil of human strife. 52</p>
<p>Endless in fertility, Bach issued in 1731 the first part of the
Klavieriibung, which he described as “exercises consisting of preludes,
allemandes, cou - rantes, sarabands, gigues, minuets, and other
galanteries, composed for the mental recreation of art lovers.” 53 In
later years he added three further in - stallments, so that this Clavier
Practice finally included several of his most famous compositions:
“inventions,” “partitas,” sinfonie, the “Goldberg Variations,” the
“Italian Concerto,” and some new chorale preludes for the organ. The
“inventions,” said the manuscript, were offered as “an honest guide by
which lovers of the clavier… are shown a plain way… not</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>only to acquire good ideas (inventiones ) , but also to work them out
them- selves,… to acquire a cantabile style of playing, and… to gain
a</p>
<p>strong predilection for composition.” 84 By these examples t he
student could see how a theme or motive, once found, might be
elaborated, usually by counterpoint, through a logical development to a
unifying conclusion. Bach played with his themes like a jolly juggler,
throwing them into the air, turning them inside out, tumbling them
upside down, then setting them soundly on their feet again. Notes and
themes were not only his meat and drink and atmosphere, they were also
his relaxation and his holidays. The partitas were similar diversions.
The Italians had applied the term partita to a dance composition in
several diverse parts. So the Partitas in D Minor and B Major used five
dance forms: the allemande, or German dance, the French courante, the
saraband, the minuet, and the gigue. The influence of Italian performers
appears here, even to the crossing of hands, a favorite device with
Domenico Scarlatti. These pieces seem slight to us now; we must remember
that they were composed not for the mighty pianoforte but for the frail
clavichord; if we do not ask too much of them they can still give us a
unique delight.</p>
<p>More difficult of digestion are the “Goldberg Variations.” Johann The
- ophilus Goldberg was clavichord player for Count Hermann Kayserling,
the Russian envoy at the Dresden court. When the Count visited Leipzig
he brought Goldberg along to soothe him to sleep with music. On these
occasions Goldberg cultivated the acquaintance of Bach, eager to learn
his keyboard technique. Kayserling expressed the wish that Bach would
write some clavichord pieces of a character “that would brighten him up
a little on his sleepless nights.” 58 Bach obliged with the “Aria with
Thirty Varia - tions,” which has proved to be a specific for insomnia.
Kayserling rewarded him with a golden goblet containing a hundred louis
d’or. It was probably he who secured for Bach the appointment as court
composer to the Saxon Elector-King.</p>
<p>Bach’s art was in these variations, but hardly his heart. With more
feel - ing and pleasure he dedicated to the clavier seven toccatas, many
sonatas, a wonderfully lively and lovely “Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue”
in D minor, and an “Italian Concerto” in which, with amazing vitality
and spirit, he tried to transfer to the keyboard the effects of a small
orchestra.</p>
<p>One form found its way into nearly all his orchestral compositions —
the fugue. The fugue, like most musical forms, had come from Italy; the
Ger- mans followed it with an impassioned pursuit that dominated their
music till Haydn. Bach experimented with it in Die Kunst der Fuge: he
took a single theme and built from it fourteen fugues and four canons in
a contra- puntal labyrinth illustrating every type of fugal technique.
He left the manuscript unfinished at his death; his son Karl Philipp
Emanuel published</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>4 2I</p>
<p>it (1752); only thirty copies were sold. The age of polyphony and the
fugue was dying with its greatest master; counterpoint was giving place
to harmony.</p>
<p>He was not as fond of the violin as of the organ and clavichord. He
had begun as a violinist, and he sometimes played the viola in the
ensembles that he at the same time conducted; but as no contemporary and
no son mention his violin playing, we may assume that he was not at his
best on that instru- ment. Yet he must have been proficient, since he
composed for the violin and the viola music of extreme difficulty, which
presumably he was ready to play himself. All the Western musical world
knows the chaconne with which he concluded a Partita in D Minor for solo
violin; it is a tour de technique that every violinist used to look to
as his supreme challenge. To some of us it is distasteful showmanship of
prestidigitation — a horse tortur- ing a cat at several removes. To Bach
it was a daring attempt to achieve on the violin the polyphonic depth
and force of the organ. When Busoni tran- scribed the piece for the
piano the polyphony became more natural, and the result was magnificent.
(We must not be supercilious about transcrip- tions, for then we should
have to condemn Bach himself.)</p>
<p>When we come to Bach’s compositions for his dainty orchestras, even
the unprofessional ear finds a dozen odes to joy. The Musikalisches
Opfer must have delighted Frederick the Great with its sparkling
melodies, and startled him with its meditative, half-Oriental strains.
In addition to the partitas or suites in the Klavieriibung Bach wrote
fifteen suites for dances. Six were called English, for reasons now
unknown; six were more under- standably called French, since they
followed French models and used French terms, including suite itself. In
some of them technique predomi- nates; then even the string instruments
emit chiefly wind. Yet the simplest soul amongst us can feel the solemn
beauty of the famous “Arioso,” or “Air for G String,” which forms the
second movement of Suite No. 3. These compositions were almost forgotten
after Bach’s death, until Men - delssohn played parts of them to Goethe
in 1830, and persuaded the Ge- wandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig to revive
them in 1838.</p>
<p>Bach adopted the concerto form as practiced by Vivaldi, and used it
in a dozen varieties of instrumental combinations. For one who was born
andante the stately slow movement makes the violin Concerto in D Minor
particularly pleasant, and it is again the adagio of the violin Concerto
No. 2 in E that moves us with its somber depth and meditative
tenderness. Per- haps the most delectable of these pieces is the
Concerto in D Minor for Two Violins; the vivace is all design without
color, like a winter elm; but the largo is an ethereal snatch of pure
beauty — beauty standing in its own right, without “program” or any
intellectual a lloy.</p>
<p>The Brandenburg Concertos have their own special history. On
March</p>
<p>422 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>23, 1721, Bach sent them to an otherwise forgotten prince with the
fol- lowing letter in French, phrased in the manner of the time:</p>
<p>To His Royal Highness, Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Branden-</p>
<p>burg:</p>
<p>Monseigneur:</p>
<p>As I had the honor of playing before your Royal Highness a couple</p>
<p>of years ago, and as I observed that you took some pleasure in the
small talent that Heaven had given me for music, and in taking leave of
me your Royal Highness honored me with a command to send you some pieces
of my composition, I now, according to your gracious orders, take the
liberty of presenting my very humble respects to your Royal Highness,
with the present concertos,… humbly praying you not</p>
<p>o judge their imperfection by the severity of the fine and delicate
taste that everyone knows you to have for music, but rather to consider
be- nignly the profound respect and very humble obedience to which they
are meant to testify. For the rest, Monseigneur, I very humbly beg</p>
<p>your Royal Highness to have the goodness to continue your graces</p>
<p>oward me, and to be convinced that I have nothing so much at heart as
the wish to be employed in natters more worthy of you and your service,
for, with zeal unequaled. Monseigneur, I am your Royal High- ness’s most
humble and most obedient servant,</p>
<p>Jean Sebastien Bach. 56</p>
<p>We do not know whether the Margrave acknowledged or rewarded the
gift; probably he did, for he was devoted to music, and maintained an
excellent orchestra. At his death (1734) the six concertos, in Bach’s
most careful and elegant hand, were listed among 127 concertos in an
inventory found by Spitta in the royal archives at Berlin. In the
inventory each of the 1 2 7 concertos was valued at four groschen ( $
1.60? ).</p>
<p>The Brandenburg Concertos follow the form of the Italian concerto</p>
<p>grosso — compositions in several movements, played by a small group
of predominating instruments (the concertino ) accompanied by and con-
trasted with an orchestra of strings (the ripieno or tutti ). Handel and
the Italians used two violins and a violoncello for the concertino; Bach
varied this with his usual audacity, putting forward a violin, an oboe,
a trumpet, and a flute as the leading instruments in the second
concerto, a violin and two flutes in the fourth, and a clavichord, a
violin, and a flute in the fifth; and he developed the structure into a
complex interplay of concertino with ripieno in a lively debate — of
separation, opposition, interpenetration, union — whose art and logic
only the professional musician can understand and enjoy. The rest of us
may find some passages wearisomely repetitious,</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>42 3</p>
<p>reminiscent of a village orchestra beating time for a dance; but even
we can feel the charm and delicacy of the dialogue, and find in the slow
move- ments a calming peace more congenial to aging hearts and laggard
feet than in the vivacious roulette of the allegros. And yet the second
concerto begins with a captivating allegro; the fourth is made
delightful by a frolicsome flute; and the fifth is Bach in excelsis.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Vocal</li>
</ol>
<p>When Bach composed for the voice he could not lay aside all the arts
and legerdemain that he had developed on the keyboard, or the
tantalizing feats that he demanded of his orchestras; he wrote for
voices as if they were instruments of almost limitless dexterity and
range, and he made only a grudging concession to the singer’s desire to
breathe. He followed the custom of his time in stretching one syllable
over half a dozen notes (“ Kyrie ele -e-e-e-e- eison”) such
proliferation is no longer in style. N ever- theless it is through his
production for the voice that Bach achieved his present repute as the
greatest composer in history.</p>
<p>His trustful faith in the Lutheran creed gave him as warm an
inspiration as any that Palestrina had found in the Catholic Mass. He
wrote some twenty-four hymns and six motets; it was in hearing one of
these six — “Singet dem Herrn”— that Mozart first felt the depth of
Bach. For the con- gregations and his choirs he wrote powerful chorales
that would have re- joiced Luth er’s kindred heart: “An Wasserfliissen
Babylons” (By the</p>
<p>Waters of Babylon), “Wenn wir in hochsten Noten sind” (When we Are in
Direst Need), “Schmiicke dich, o liebe Seele” (Make Yourself Beautiful,
Beloved Soul); this last so affected Mendelssohn that he told Schumann,
“If life were to deprive me of hope and faith, this one chorale would
bring them back.” 57</p>
<p>For the feasts of Christmas, Easter, and the Ascension Bach composed
oratorios — massive songs for choruses, soloists, organ, or orchestra.
The Weihnachts Oratorium, as he called the first, was performed in the
Thomas- kirche in six parts in six days between Christmas and Epiphany,
1734-35. Assuming full right to his own property, he took some seventeen
arias or choruses from his earlier works, and wove them into a two-hour
story of the birth of Christ. Some of the self -plagiarisms hardly
harmonized with the new text, but one could forgive many faults in a
composition that pre- sented, almost at the outset, th e chorus “How
Shall I Fitly Meet Thee?”</p>
<p>Essentially the oratorios were combinations of cantatas. The cantata
itself was a chorale interspersed with arias. Since the Lutheran service
frequently invited cantatas, Bach composed about three hundred, of which
some two</p>
<p>4*4 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>hundred survive. Their intimate connection with the Lutheran ritual
has limited their audience in our time, but many of the airs embedded in
them have a beauty transcending any theology. At Weimar, in his
twenty-sixth year ( 1 7 1 1 ) , Bach wrote his first outstanding
cantata, “Actus tragicus,” mourning the tragedy of death but rejoicing
in the hope of resurrection. In 1 7 14-17 he commemorated the divisions
of the ecclesiastical year with some of his finest cantatas: for the
first Sunday in Advent, 1714, “Nun komm, du Heiden Heiland” (Now Come,
Thou Saviour of the Heathen) ; for Easter of 1715, “Der Himmel lacht,
die Erde jubilieret” (The Heavens Laugh, the Earth Rejoices), in which
he used three trumpets, a kettledrum, three oboes, two violins, two
violas, two violoncellos, a bassoon, and a key- board continuo to help
the chorus, and persuade the congregation, to shake with joy over the
triumph of Christ; for the fourth Sunday in Advent, 1715, “Herz und Mund
und Tat und Leben” (Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life), with the
familiar lilting chorale and oboe obbligato, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s
Desiring”; and for the sixteenth Sunday after Trinity, 1715,</p>
<p>“Komm, du siisse Todesstunde” (Come, Thou Sweet Hour of Death). At
Leipzig he composed another paean to Christ’s resurrection— “Christ lag
in Todesbanden” (Christ Lay in Death’s Dark Prison). And for the bicen -
tennial (1730) of the Augsburg Confession he put Luther’s hymn “Ein’
feste Burg is t unser Gott” into the form of a cantata as powerful as
the hymn, but perhaps too wildly furious to be a fit expression of
faith.</p>
<p>Religious though he was, and wedded to piety by his tasks, Bach had
in him a healthy sense of earthly joys, and could laugh as heartily as
he could mourn. Secular elements crept into his religious compositions;
so some strains from the operas of his time have been detected in the
B-Minor Mass. 58 He did not hesitate to lavish the resources of his art
upon purely secular cantatas, of which twenty- one exist. He composed a
“Hunt Can - tata,” a “Coffee Cantata,” a “Wedding Cantata,” and seven
cantatas for civic ceremonies. In 1725, for the birthday of Professor
August Muller of Leipzig University, he wrote a full-length cant ata,
“Der zufriedengestellte Aeolus,” celebrating, perhaps with a sly
metaphor, the liberation of the winds. In 1 742 he gave his music to a
frankly burlesque “Peasants’ Cantata,”</p>
<p>Before religious music entered into its decline Bach carried it to
heights never reached before in Protestant lands. Among the many
survivals of Catholic liturgy in the Lutheran service was the singing of
the Magnificat on the Feast of the Visitation (July 2). This
commemorated the visit of Mary to her cousin Elizabeth, when, according
to the Gospel of St. Luke (i, 46-55), the Virgin uttered her
incomparable song of thanksgiving:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>Magnificat anima mea dominum,</p>
<p>Et exsultavit spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo,</p>
<p>Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae;</p>
<p>Ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes</p>
<p>—“My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
my Saviour, for He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden;
behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.” Bach twice set
the se and subsequent lines to music; in the present form probably for
the Christmas service at Leipzig in 1723. Here religion, poetry, and
music all reach the same summit in a noble unity.</p>
<p>Six years later he touched those heights again and again in The
Passion according to St. Matthew. To set to music the story of Christ’s
sufferings and death had for centuries been part of Catholic ritual.
Many Protestant composers in Germany had adapted the cantata form to
this purpose; two of them had already used the Gospel of St. Matthew as
their text. 59 Bach wrote at least three Passions, following severally
the narratives of John (1723), Matthew (1729), and Mark (1731). Of this
last only fragments remain. The J ohannespassion suffers from an
illogical sequence of scenes and mingling of events, and from a Teutonic
tendency to thunderous dec- lamations; but the later parts subside to a
tenderness and delicacy of feeling, a somber depth of contemplation, as
moving as anything in music. The aria “Es ist vollbracht” (It Is
Accomplished) is a profound rendering of the crucial event in the
Christian story; there could be no greater test of a composer or a
painter.</p>
<p>On Good Friday afternoon, April 15, 1729, in the Thomaskirche at
Leip- zig, Bach produced the greatest of his compositions. In this
Matthauspassion he had the advantage of a good German libretto, based on
Matthew’s rela - tively full account, and arranged by a local
litterateur, Christian Friedrich Henrici, pennamed “Picander.” Bach
himself seems to have written the text</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>itself. For to us in Western civilization this remains the most
moving of all tragedies, since it does not merely represent the
crucifixion of a noble ideal- ist by our fellow men, but symbolizes also
his daily crucifixion in Christen- dom, and the slow death, in many of
us, of the faith that loved him as its God.</p>
<p>Bach almost succeeded in touching again, in the B-Minor Mass, the</p>
<p>heights of emotion and artistry reached in the Matthauspassion. But
he could not feel so fully in harmony with his new enterprise. The
Gospel Passion was the root and pivot of the Protestant creed, and Bach
was ir- revocably immersed in that creed. The Mass, however, was a Roman
Cath- olic development; the Credo itself voiced unmistakable commitment
to “unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam.” Though the
Lutheran</p>
<p>Shall we expose the hesitant reservations with which we admire this
mas- sive Mass in B Minor? Bach’s power overrides in many numbers the
humil - ity that should infuse an address to the Deity; sometimes it
seems that he must have thought God hard of hearing, as having been so
long silent in so many languages. The Kyrie drags along its rumbling and
confused immen- sity, until at last we too cry “Eleison— have mercy!”
The Gloria is often exquisite in its orchestral accompaniment, and moves
on to a lovely aria, the “Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris”; but then it
becomes raucous w ith horns</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>in the “Quoniam tu solus sanctus,” and treats the “Cum - Sancto
Spiritu” with such staccato thunder as must have made the Holy Spirit
tremble lest this mighty Teuton should take heaven by storm. Strange to
say, the Credo — whose doctrinal niceties, dividing Christendom, do not
naturally lend themselves to music — produces the supreme moments of the
B-Minor Mass: the “Et incarnatus est” and the Crucifixus, where Bach
catches again the hushed rev erence of the St. Matthew Passion. Then the
“Et resurrexit” brings out all the impatient fortissimi of trumpets and
drums to shout and roar with jubilation over Christ’s conquest of death.
The Benedictus calms us with its delicate tenor aria and its heavenly
violin solo; the orchestral accompaniment to the Agnus Dei is profoundly
beautiful; but the “Dona</p>
<p>nobis pacem” is a proof of power rather than a gift of peace. These
are</p>
<p>frank reactions of no critical worth. Only those can fully appreciate
the B-Minor Mass who, to a Christian rearing that has not lost its
emotional overtones, add the technical competence to discern and enjoy
the structure, tonalities, and workmanship of the composition, the
variety of resources used, the complexity of the orchestration, and the
adaptation of musical motives to the ideas of the text.</p>
<p>Some professional musicians criticized Bach in his lifetime. In
1737</p>
<p>Johann Adolf Scheibe (later Kapellmeister to the King of Denmark)
pub- lished an anonymous letter praising Bach as an organist, but
suggesting that “this great man would be the admiration of all nations
if he had more amen - ity, and if his works were not made unnatural by
their turgid and confused character, and th eir beauty obscured by too
much art.” 90 A year later Scheibe renewed the attack: “Bach’s church
pieces are constantly more artificial and tedious, and by no means so
full of impressive conviction, or of such intellectual reflection, as
the works of Tel emann and Graun.” 61 Scheibe had tried to obtain the
post of organist at Leipzig; Bach had com- mented unfavorably on his
test performance, and had satirized him in a cantata; there may have
been some spite in Scheibe’s critique. But Spitta, the most z ealous of
Bach’s admirers, tells us that many of Scheibe’s con - temporaries
shared his views. 62 Some of the critics may have represented the
reaction of the new generation in Germany against the contrapuntal music
that had reached in Bach an excellence beyond which nothing seemed pos-
sible except imitations; the twentieth century has seen a similar
reaction against the symphony.</p>
<p>Scheibe would probably have preferred Handel to Bach. But Handel was
so lost to England that Germans must have found it difficult to compare
him with Bach. When this was done it was always to place Handel first.
63 Beethoven expressed the German view when he said, “Handel is the
great - est of us all”; 64 but that was bef ore Bach had been quite
resurrected from oblivion. It is a pity that these two giants — the
chief glories of music and</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>of Germany in the first half of the eighteenth century — never met;
they might have influenced each other beneficently. Both men stemmed
from the organ, and were recognized as the greatest organists of their
time; Bach continued to favor that instrument, while Handel, moving
among divas and castrati, gave supremacy to the voice. Handel wedded
Italian melody to German counterpoint, and opened a road to the future;
Bach was the com- pletion and perfection of the polyphonic, fugal,
contrapuntal past. Even his sons felt that no further movement was open
on that line.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was something healthy in that old music, which men
like Mendelssohn would recall with longing; for it was still infused
with trustful faith, not yet disturbed by doubts that would reach to the
heart of the consoling creed. It was the voice of a culture “in form,”
as the consist - ency and culmination of a tradition and an art. It
reflected the ornamental elaboration of baroque, and of a now
unchallenged aristocracy. Germany had not yet entered its Aufkldrung,
nor heard any chanticleers of revolu- tion. Lessing was still young;
nearly every German took for granted the Nicene Creed; only Prince
Frederick of Prussia preferred Voltaire. Soon the magnificent structure
of inherited beliefs and ways was to be shaken almost to collapse by the
agitations of innovating minds; that old ordered peace, that stability
of classes, that marvelous and unquestioning faith, which had written
the music of Bach, would pass away; and all things, even music, would
change, always excepting man.</p>

<p>His isolation and domestication in Leipzig enabled him to inherit the
past without resentment or revolt. His religious faith was, next to his
music, his comfort and refuge. He had eighty-three volumes of theology,
exegesis, or homilies in his library. To his masculine and orthodox
Lutheranism he added some tinge of mysticism, perhaps from the Pietist
movement of his time — even though he opposed Pietism as hostile to any
church music but hymns. Most of his music was a form of worship. Usually
he began to compose by praying “Jesu juva” (Jesus help me). He prefaced
or ended nearly all his works by dedicating them to the honor and glory
of God. He defined music as “eine wohlklingende Harmonie zur Ehre Gottes
und zuldssigen Ergotzung des Gemuths ,, —“an agreeable harmony for the
honor of God and the permissible delight of the soul.” 65</p>
<p>The portraits that survive show him in his later years as a typical
Ger- man, broad-shouldered, stout, with full and ruddy face and majestic
nose; add arched eyebrows that gave him an imperious, half-irritated,
half-chal- lenging look. He had a temper, and fought stoutly for his
place and views;</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE GERMANY OF BACH</p>
<p>429</p>
<p>otherwise he was an amiable and kindly bear, who could unbend his
dignity in humor when opposition ceased. He took no part in the social
life of Leipzig, but he did not stint in hospitality to his friends,
among whom he numbered many rivals like Hasse and Graun. 66 He was a
family man, doubly absorbed in his work and his home. He trained all his
ten surviving children to music, and provided them with instruments; his
house contained five claviers, a lute, a viola da gamba, and several
violins, violas, and violon- cellos. As early as 1730 he wrote to a
friend: “I can already form a con - cert, both vocal and instrumental,
from my own family.” 67 We may see later how his sons carried on his art
and surpassed his fame.</p>
<p>In his final years his eyesight failed. In 1749 he consented to an
operation by the same doctor who had treated Handel with apparent
success; this time it failed, and left him totally blind. Thereafter he
lived in a darkened room, for the light that he could not see hurt his
eyes. Like the deaf Bee- thoven, he continued to compose despite his
affliction; now he dictated to a son-in- law the chorale prelude “Wenn
wir in hochsten Noten sind.” He had long prepared himself for death, had
disciplined himself to accept it as, in its due time, a gift of the
gods: so he composed the moving “Komm, Siisser Tod”:</p>
<p>Come, kindly Death, blessed repose,</p>
<p>Come, for my life is dreary,</p>
<p>And I of earth am weary.</p>
<p>Come, for I wait for thee,</p>
<p>Come soon and calm thou me;</p>
<p>Gently mine eyelids close;</p>
<p>Come, blest repose. 68</p>
<p>On July 18, 1750, his eyesight seemed miraculously restored; his
family gathered around in joy. But suddenly, on July 28, he died of an
apoplectic stroke. In the hopeful language of the time, “he fell calmly
and blessedly asleep in God.” 69</p>
<p>After his death he was almost forgotten. Part of this oblivescence
was due to the confinement of Bach to Leipzig, part to the difficulty of
his vocal compositions, part to the decline of taste for religious music
and contra- puntal forms. Johann Hiller, who in 1789 occupied Bach’s
place as cantor of the Thomasschule, sought “to inspire the pupils with
abhorrence of the crudities of Bach.” 70 The name Bach, in the second
half of the eighteenth</p>
<p>Only his sons remembered his work. Two of them described it to Johann
Nicolaus Forkel, director of music at the University of Gottingen.
Forkel</p>
<p>430 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>studied several of the compositions, became enthusiastic, and
published in 1 802 an eighty-nine-page biography which declared that</p>
<p>he works that Johann Sebastian Bach has left us are a priceless
national heritage, of a kind that no other race possesses…. The
preservation of the memory of this great man is not merely a concern of
art, it is a concern of the nation…. This man, the greatest musical poet
and</p>
<p>he greatest musical theoretician that has ever existed, and that
prob- ably will ever exist, was a German. Be proud of him, O Fatherland!
72</p>
<p>This appeal to patriotism opened Bach’s grave. Karl Zelter, director
of the Singakademie in Berlin, bought the manuscript of the
Matthauspassion. Felix Mendelssohn, Zelter ’s pupil, prevailed upon him
to let him conduct, at the Singakademie, the first non-church
performance of the composition (March 1 1, 1829). A friend of
Mendelssohn remarked that the St. Matthew Passion had come to light
almost exactly a hundred years after its first presentation, and that a
twenty-year-old Jew was accountable for its resur- rection. 73 All the
performers gave their services free. Mendelssohn added to the revival by
including other works of Bach in his recitals. In 1830 he was for a time
the guest of Goethe, who kept him busy playing Bach.</p>
<p>The revival fell in with the Romantic movement, and with the renewal
of religious faith after the Napoleonic Wars. Rationalism had had its
day; it had been associated with the murderous Revolution, and with that
ter- rible “Son of the Revolution” who had so often humiliated Germany
on the battlefield; now Germany was victorious, and even Hegel joined in
ac- claiming Bach as a hero of the nation. In 1837 Robert Schumann
appealed for the complete publication of Bach’s works; in 1 850 the
Bachgesellschaft was formed; Bach manuscripts were collected from every
source; in 1851 the first volume was issued, in 1900 the forty-sixth and
last. Brahms said that the two greatest events in German history during
his lifetime were the foundation of the German Empire and the complete
publication of Bach. 74 Today these compositions are more frequently
performed than those of any other composer, and the ranking of Bach as
“the greatest musical poet that has ever existed” is accepted throughout
the Western world.</p>
