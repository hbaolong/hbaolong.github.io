<h4 id="chapter-xxii">CHAPTER XXII</h4>
<p>Spinoza</p>
<p>1632-77</p>
<p>I. THE YOUNG HERETIC</p>
<p>T HIS strange and lovable character, who made the boldest attempt in
modem history to find a philosophy that could take the place of a lost
religious faith, was born in Amsterdam on November 24, 1632. His
ancestors can be traced to the town of Espinosa, near Burgos, in the
Spanish province of Leon. They were Jews who, as conversos to
Christianity, in- cluded scholars, priests, and Cardinal Diego
d’Espinosa, onetime grand inquisitor. 1 Part of the family, presumably
to escape the Spanish Inquisition, migrated to Portugal. After a period
of residence there, at Vidigueira, near Beja, the grandfather and father
of the philosopher moved to Nantes in France, and thence, in 1593, to
Amsterdam. They were among the first Jews who settled in that city,
eager to enjoy the religious freedom guaran- teed in 1579 by the Union
of Utrecht. By 1628 the grandfather was re- garded as head of the
Sephardic community in Amsterdam; at various times the father was warden
of the Jewish school there and president of the organized charities of
the Portuguese synagogue. The mother, Hana Debora d’Espinoza, came to
Amsterdam from Lisbon. She died when Baruch was six years old, leaving
him a consumptive heredity. He was brought up by the father and a third
wife. As “Baruch” was Hebrew for blessed, the boy was later named
Benedictus in official and Latin documents.- In the synagogue school
Baruch was given a predominantly religious education, based upon the Old
Testament and the Talmud; there was also some study of Hebrew
philosophers, especially Abraham ibn Ezra, Moses ben Maimon, and Hasdai
Crescas, with perhaps some dippings into the Cabala. Among his teachers
were two men of prominence and ability in the community, Saul Morteira
and Manasseh ben Israel. Outside of school Baruch received, in Spanish,
considerable instruction in secular subjects, since his father wished to
prepare him for a business career. In addition to Spanish and Hebrew he
learned Portuguese, Dutch, and Latin, with later a touch of Italian and
French. He developed a fondness for mathematics, and made geometry the
ideal of his philosophical method and thought.</p>
<p>It was natural that a youth of exceptionally active mind should raise
some questions about the doctrines transmitted to him in the
synagogue</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>school. Perhaps even there he had heard of Hebrew heresies. Ibn Ezra
had long ago pointed out the difficulties involved in ascribing to Moses
the later parts of the Pentateuch; Maimonides had proposed allegorical
interpretations of some otherwise indigestible passages in the Bible, 2
and had suggested some doubts about personal immortality, 3 and about
Crea- tion as against the eternity of the world. 4 Crescas had ascribed
extension to God, and had rejected all attempts to prove by reason the
freedom of the will, the survival of the soul, and even the existence of
God. In addition to these predominantly orthodox Jews, Spinoza must have
read Levi ben Gerson, who had reduced Biblical miracles to natural
causes, and had subordinated faith to reason, saying, “The Torah cannot
prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to
believe.” 5 And only recently, in this Amsterdam community, Uriel Acosta
had challenged the belief in immortality, and, humiliated by
excommunication, had shot himself (1647). The vague recollection of that
tragedy must have deepened the turmoil in Spinoza’s mind when he felt
slipping from him the upholding theology of his people and his
family.</p>
<p>In 1654 his father died. A daughter claimed the whole estate; Spinoza
contested her claim in court, won his case, and then turned over to her
all of the legacy but a bed. Now dependent upon himself, he earned his
bread by grinding and polishing lenses for spectacles, microscopes, and
telescopes. In addition to tutoring some private pupils, he became an
in- structor in the Latin school of Frans van den Ende, ex- Jesuit,
freethinker, dramatist, and revolutionary.* There Spinoza improved his
Latin; perhaps he was stimulated by van den Ende to study Descartes,
Bacon, and Hobbes; he may now have dipped into the Summa theologiae of
Thomas</p>
<p>Aquinas. He seems to have fallen in love with the headmaster’s
daughter; she preferred a more affluent suitor, and Spinoza, so far as
we know, made no further move toward marriage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had begun to lose his faith. Probably before reaching
the age of twenty he had ventured, with all the pain and trepidation
that such moltings bring to sensitive spirits, upon some exciting ideas
— that matter may be the body of God, that angels may be phantoms of the
imagination, that the Bible said nothing of immortality, that the soul
is identical with life. 7 He might have kept these proud heresies to
himself had his father lived; and even after his father’s death he might
have remained silent had not some friends importuned him with questions.
After much hesitation, he confessed to them the tremors of his faith.
They reported him to the synagogue.</p>
<p>It has often been pointed out, but must always be borne in mind,
that</p>
<ul>
<li>Later van den Ende served the Dutch as a secret agent in Paris; he
was captured by the French government, and was hanged ( 1676) . 6</li>
</ul>
<p>622</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>the leaders of the Jewish community in Amsterdam were in a difficult
position in dealing with heresies that attacked the fundamentals of the
Christian as well as the Jewish creed. The Jews enjoyed in the Dutch
Republic a religious toleration denied them elsewhere in Christendom;
but that could be withdrawn if they tolerated among themselves ideas
that might unsettle the religious basis of morality and social order.
According to the biography of Spinoza written in the year of his death
by a French refugee in Holland, Jean Maximilien Lucas, the students who
reported Baruch’s doubts falsely added the charge that he had expressed
scorn of the Jewish people for thinking itself especially chosen by God,
and for believing that God was the author of the Mosaic Code. 8 We do
not know how far we can trust this account. In any case the Jewish
leaders must have resented any disruption of the faith that had been a
tower of strength and a well of comfort to the Jews through centuries of
bitter suffering.</p>
<p>The rabbis summoned Spinoza, and chided him for disappointing the
bright hopes that his teachers had held for his future in the community.
One of these teachers, Manasseh ben Israel, was absent in London. An-
other, Saul Morteira, pleaded with the youth to abandon his heresies. In
fairness to the rabbis we must note that Lucas, though strongly
sympathetic with Spinoza, records that when Morteira recalled the loving
care he had given to the education of his favor ite pupil, Baruch
“answered that in return for the trouble Morteira had taken in teaching
him the Hebrew language, he 〔Spinoza〕 would now be glad to teach his
instructor how to excommunicate.” 9 This seems quite out of character
with all else that we hear of Spinoza, but we must not let our
affections select the evidence; and (to vary a remark of Cicero’s) there
is hardly anything so foolish but we can find it in the lives of the
philosophers.</p>
<p>We are told that the synagogue leaders offered Spinoza an annual
pension of a thousand gulden if he would promise to take no hostile step
against Judaism, and would show himself from time to time in the
synagogue. 10 The rabbis appear to have invoked against him at first
only the “lesser excommunication,” w hich merely excluded him, for
thirty days, from intercourse with the Jewish community. 11 We are told
that he accepted this sentence with a light heart, saying, “Good; they
are forcing me to do nothing that I would not have done of my own free
will”; 12 probably he was already living outside the Jewish quarter of
the city. A fanatic tried to assassinate him, but the weapon only tore
Spinoza’s coat. On July 24, 1656, the religious and secular authorities
of the Jewish community solemnly pronounced from the pulpit of the
Portuguese synagogue the full excommunication of “Baruch d’Espinosa,”
with all the customary curses and prohibitions: no one was to speak or
write to him, or do him any service, or read his writings, or come wi
thin the space of four cubits’</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>623</p>
<p>distance from him. 13 Morteira went before the Amsterdam officials,
notified them of the charges and the excommunication, and asked that
Spinoza be expelled from the city. They sentence d Spinoza to “an exile
of some</p>
<p>months.” 14 He went to the nearby village of Ouderkerk, but soon
returned to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>His knowledge of Hebrew won him several friends in a little circle of
students led by Lodewijk Meyer and Simon de Vries. Meyer had degrees in
philosophy and medicine; in 1666 he published Philosophiae Sacrae
Scripturae interpres, which subordinated the Bible to reason; it may
have reflected — or influenced — the views of Spinoza. De Vries, a
prosperous merchant, was so fond of Spinoza that he wished to give him
two thousand florins; Spinoza refused to take them. When de Vries neared
death (1667) he proposed, being unmarried, to make Spinoza his heir;
Spinoza persuaded him to leave the entire estate to a brother; the
gratified brother offered him an annuity of five hundred florins;
Spinoza accepted three hundred. 15 Another Amsterdam friend, Johan
Bouwmeester, wrote to Spinoza, “Love me, for I love you with all my
heart.” 16 Next to philosophy, frien dship was the chief support of
Spinoza’s life. In one of his letters he wrote:</p>
<p>Of all the things that are beyond my power, I value nothing more</p>
<p>highly than to be allowed the honor of entering into bonds of friend-
ship with people who sincerely love truth. For, of things beyond our
power, I believe there is nothing in the world which we can love</p>
<p>with tranquility except such men. 17</p>
<p>He was not quite a recluse, nor an ascetic. He approved “good
food</p>
<p>and drink, the enjoyment of beauty and growing plants, the hearing of
music, visits to the theater”; 18 it was on such a visit that the
attempt had</p>
<p>interrupted his speculations” 20 that Spinoza in 1660 left Amsterdam
to live in the quiet village of Rijnsburg — “town on the Rhine” — six
miles from Leiden. The Collegiants, a Mennonite sect resembling the
Quakers, made their headquarters there, and Spinoza found welcome in one
of their families.</p>
<p>In that modest dwelling, now preserved as the Spinozahuis, the
philoso- pher wrote several minor works, and Book I of the Ethics. He
composed in 1662 a Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being; but
this was largely a reflection of Descartes. More interesting is the
fragment De Intellectus Emendatione (On the Improvement of the
Intellect), which was set aside, unfinished, in that same year. Within
its forty pages we</p>
<p>624 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XXII</p>
<p>get a preview of Spinoza’s philosophy. We feel the loneliness of the
out- cast in its first sentences:</p>
<p>After experience had taught me that all things that frequently
take</p>
<p>place in ordinary life are vain and futile; when I saw that all
the</p>
<p>things I feared, and which feared me, had nothing good or bad in</p>
<p>them save in so far as the mind was affected by them, I determined at
last to inquire whether there might be anything which might be</p>
<p>truly good and able to communicate its goodness, and by which the
mind might be affected to the exclusion of all other things.</p>
<p>He felt that riches could not do this, nor fame (honor), nor the
pleasures of the flesh (libido)-, turmoil and grief are too often
mingled with these delights. “Only the love towards a thing eternal and
infinite feeds the</p>
<p>knowledge of the union which the mind has with the whole of nature. .
. . The more the mind understands the order of nature, the more easily
it will be able to liberate itself from useless things ”; 23 here is
Spinoza’ s first phrasing of the “intellectual love of God” — the
reconciliation of the indi- vidual with the nature of things and the
laws of the universe.</p>
<p>This eloquent little treatise states also the aim of Spinoza’s
thinking, and his understanding of scien ce and philosophy. “I wish to
direct all sciences in one direction or to one end, namely, to attain
the greatest possible human perfection; and thus everything in the
sciences that does not pro- mote this endeavor must be rejected as
useless .” 23 Here is quite a different strain from that which we heard
in Francis Bacon; the progress of the sciences is a delusion if they
merely increase man’s power over things with - out improving his
character and desires. That is why the chef -d? oeuvre of modern
philosophy will be called Ethics despite its long metaphysical prelude,
and why so much of it will analyze the bondage of man to desire, and his
liberation through reason.</p>

<li>THEOLOGY AND POLITICS</li>
</ol>
<p>The circle of gentlemen students whom Spinoza had left behind in</p>
<p>Amsterdam heard that he had begun, for a pupil in Rijnsburg, a
geometrical</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>62 5</p>
<p>version of Descartes’ Principia philosophiae. They importuned him to
complete it and send it to them. He did, and they financed its
publication (1663) as Renati Des Cartes Principia Philosophiae more
geometrico demonstrata. We need note only three things about it: that it
expressed Descartes’ views (for example, on free will), not Spinoza’s;
that it was the only book of Spinoza’s printed in his lifetime over his
own name; and that in an appended fragment, Cogitata metaphysica, he
suggested that time was not an objective reality, but a mode of
thinking. 24 This is one of several Kantian elements in Spinoza’s
philosophy.</p>
<p>In Rijnsburg he made some new friends. The great anatomist Steno be-
came acquainted with him there. Henry Oldenburg, of the Royal Society,
coming to Leiden in 1661, went out of his way to visit Spinoza, and was
deeply impressed; returning to London, he began a long correspondence
with the unprinted but already famous philosopher. Another Rijnsburg
friend, Adriaan Koerbagh, was summoned before an Amsterdam court (1668),
charged with “intemperate” opposition to the prevailing theology; one
magistrate sought to implicate Spinoza as the source of Koerbagh’s
heresies; Koerbagh denied this, and Spinoza was spared; but the young
heretic was sentenced to ten years in prison, where he died after he had
served fifteen months of his term. 25 We can understand why Spinoza did
not rush into print.</p>
<p>In June, 1663, he moved to Voorburg, near Hie Hague. For six
years</p>
<p>he lived in the home of an artist, still polishing lenses and
composing the Ethics. The desperate defensive war of the United
Provinces against Louis XIV frightened the Dutch government into tighter
restrictions on the expression of ideas. Nevertheless Spinoza published
anonymously, in 1670, a Treatise on Theology and Politics that became a
milestone in Biblical criticism. The title page of this Tractatus
theologico-politicus stated the purpose: “to set forth that freedom of
thought and speech not only may, without prejudice to piety and the
public peace, be granted, but that also it may not, without danger to
piety and the public peace, be withheld.” Spinoza disclaimed atheism,
supported the fundamentals of religious belief, but undertook to show
the human fallibility of those Scriptures upon which the Calvinist
clergy based their theology and intolerance. The clergy in Holland were
using their influence, and their Biblical texts, to oppose the party led
by the de Witts, which favored liberal thought and negotiations for
peace; and Spinoza was warmly devoted to that party and to Jan de
Witt.</p>
<p>As I marked the fierce controversies of philosophers raging in</p>
<p>Church and state, the source of bitter hatred and dissension . . . ,
I</p>
<p>determined to examine the Bible afresh in a careful, impartial,
and</p>
<p>6a6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>unfettered spirit, making no assumptions concerning it, and
attributing to it no doctrines which I do not find clearly therein set
down. With</p>
<p>these precautions I constructed a method of scriptural
interpretation. 26</p>
<p>He noted and illustrated the difficulty of understanding the Hebrew
of the Old Testament; the Masoretic text — which filled in the vowels
and accents omitted by the original writers — was partly guesswork, and
could hardly give us an indisputable prototype. He profited much, in the
earlier chapters of this treatise, from Maimonides’ Guide to the
Perplexed. He followed Abraham ibn Ezra and others in questioning the
Mosaic author- ship of the Pentateuch. He denied that Joshua had
composed the Book of Joshua; and he ascribed the historical books of the
Old Testament to the priest-scribe Ezra, of the fifth century b.c. The
Book of Job, he thought, was a Gentile production translated into
Hebrew. Not all these conclusions have been accepted by later research;
but they were a brave advance toward understanding the composition of
the Bible; and they preceded by eight years the more scholarly Critique
du Vieux Testament (1678) of Richard Simon. Spinoza pointed out that in
several instances the same story or passage was repeated in different
places in the Bible, sometimes in the same words, sometimes in divergent
versions; the one case suggesting common borrowing from an earlier
manuscript, the other raising the question as to which account was the
Word of God. 27 There were chronological im- possibilities and
contradictions. In his Epistle to the Romans (111, 20-28) Paul taught
that man can be saved only by faith, not by works; the Epistle of the
Apostle James (11, 24) taught precisely the opposite; which was God’s
view and Word? Such diverse texts, the philosopher pointed out, have
generated bitterest — even murderous — quarrels among theologians, not
the good conduct that a religion should inspire.</p>
<p>Were the Old Testament prophets the voice of God? Evidently they</p>
<p>were not ahead of the knowledge shared by the educated classes of
their time; “Joshua,” for example, took it for granted that the sun,
until he “stopped” it, revolved around the earth. 28 The prophets e
xcelled not in learning but in intensity of imagination, enthusiasm, and
feeling; they were great poets and orators. They may have been divinely
inspired, but if so it was by a process that Spinoza confessed himself
unable to understand. 29 Perhaps they dreamed that they saw God; and
they may have believed in the reality of their dream. So we read of
Abimelech that “God said unto him in a dream” (Gen. xx, 6). The divine
element in the prophets was not their prophecies but their virtuous
lives; and the theme of their preach- ing was that religion lies in good
conduct, not in sedulous ritual.</p>
<p>Were the miracles recorded in the Bible real interruptions of the
normal course of nature? Did the sins of men bring down fire and flood,
and did</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>627</p>
<p>the prayers of men give fertility to the earth? Such stories, Spinoza
sug- gested, were used by the Scriptural authors to reach the
understanding of simple men and move them to virtue or devotion; we must
not take them literally.</p>
<p>When, therefore, the Bible says that the earth is barren because
of</p>
<p>men’s sins, or that the blind were healed by faith, we ought to
take</p>
<p>no more notice than when it says that God is angry at men’s sins,</p>
<p>that he is sad, that he repents of the good he has promised or done,
or that, on seeing a sign, he remembers something he had promised; these
and similar expressions are either thrown out poetically, or re- lated
according to the opinions and prejudices of the writer. We may be
absolutely certain that every event which is truly described in</p>
<p>Scripture necessarily happened — like everything else — according to
natural law; and if anything is there set down which can be proved</p>
<p>in set terms to contravene the order of nature, or not to be
deducible therefrom, we must believe it to have been foisted into the
sacred</p>
<p>writings by irreligious hands; for whatsoever is contrary to nature
is contrary to reason, and whatsoever is contrary to reason is absurd .
30</p>
<p>This was probably the most forthright declaration of independence yet
made for reason by a modern philosopher. So far as it was accepted, it
involved a revolution of profounder significance and results than all
the wars and politics of the time.</p>
<p>In what sense, then, is the Bible the Word of God? Only in this:
that</p>
<p>it contains a moral code that can form men to virtue. It contains
also many things that have led — or been adapted — to human deviltry.
For the gen- erality of men (too obsessed with daily cares to have
leisure or capacity for intellectual development) the Biblical stories
can be a beneficent aid to morality. But the emphasis of religious
teaching should always be upon conduct rather than creed. It is a suff
icient creed to believe in “a God, that is, a supreme being who loves
justice and charity,” and whose proper worship “consists in the practice
of justice and love towards one’s neigh - bor.” No other doctrine is
necessary . 31</p>
<p>Aside from that doctrine, thought should be free. The Bible was not
intended to be a textbook of science or philosophy; these are revealed
to us in nature, and this natural revelation is the truest and most
universal voice of God.</p>
<p>Between faith or theology and philosophy . . . there is no
connec-</p>
<p>tion, or affinity. . . . Philosophy has no end in view save truth;
faith . . . looks for nothing but obedience and piety. . . . Faith,
therefore, allows the greatest latitude in philosophical speculation,
allowing us without</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>blame to think what we like about anything, and only condemning, as
heretics and schismatics, those who teach opinions that tend to produce
hatred, anger, and strife . 32</p>
<p>So Spinoza, in his own optimistic v ariation, renewed Pomponazzi’s
dis - tinction between two truths, the theological and the
philosophical, each of which, though contradictory, may be allowed to
the same person in the one case as a citizen, in the other as a
philosopher. Spinoza would allow to secular officials the right to
compel obedience to the laws; the state, like the individual, has the
right of self-preservation. But he adds:</p>
<p>With religion the case is widely different. Since it consists not
so</p>
<p>much in outward action as in simplicity and truth of character,
it</p>
<p>stands outside the sphere of law and public authority. Simplicity and
truth of character are not produced by the constraint of laws, nor by
the authority of the state; no one the whole world over can be forced or
legislated into a state of blessedness; the means required for such a
consummation are faithful and brotherly admonition, sound educa- tion,
and, above all, free use of the individual judgment. … It is in</p>
<p>every man’s power to wield the supreme righ t and authority of free
judgment . . . and to explain and interpret religion for himself .
33</p>
<p>The public practice of religion should be subject to state control,
for though religion may be a vital force in molding morality, the state
must remain supreme in all matters affecting public conduct. Spinoza was
as firm an Erastian as Hobbes, and followed him in subordinating the
Church to the state, but he cautioned his readers, “I speak here only of
the out - ward observances, . . . not of . . . the inwar d worship .” 34
And (probably having Louis XIV in mind) he rose to hot indignation in
denouncing the use of religion by the state for purposes contrary to
what he conceives as basic religion — justice and benevolence.</p>
<p>If, in despotic statecraft, the supreme and essential mystery be
to</p>
<p>hoodwink the subjects, and to mask the fear, which keeps them down,
with the specious garb of religion, so that men may fight as bravely</p>
<p>for slavery as for safety, and count it not shame but highest
honor</p>
<p>to risk their blood and their lives for the vainglory of a tyrant;
yet in a free state no more mischievous expedient could be planned or
at-</p>
<p>tempted. 〔It is〕 wholy repugnant to the general freedom . . .
when</p>
<p>law enters the domain of speculative thought, and opinions are put on
trial and condemned on the same footing as crimes, while those who
defend and follow them are sacrificed not to public safety, but to</p>
<p>their opponents’ hatred and cruelty. If deeds alone could be made the
ground of criminal charges, and words were always allowed to pass</p>
<p>free, . . . seditions would be divested of every semblance of
justification,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>and would be separated from mere controversy by a hard and fast</p>
<p>line . 35</p>
<p>In examining the Scriptures Spinoza faced the fundamental issue be-
tween Christians and Jews: Had Christianity been unfaithful to Christ in
rejecting the Mosaic Law? In his opinion that Law was intended for the
Jews in their own state, and not for other nations, not even for the
Jews themselves when living in an alien society; only the moral laws in
the Mosaic Code (like the Ten Commandments) have eternal and universal
validity . 36 Some passages in Spinoza’s discussion of Judaism reveal a
strong resentment of his excommunication, and an anxiety to justify his
rejection of the synagogue’s teachings. But he joined the Jews in hoping
for their early restoration to an autonomous Israel. “I would go so far
as to believe that . . . they may even raise up their state anew, and
God may elect them a second time .” 37</p>
<p>He made several approaches to Christianity. He apparently read the
New Testament with increasing admiration for Christ. He rejected the
notion of Christ’s p hysical resurrection from the dead , 38 but he
found himself in such sympathy with the preaching of Jesus that he
conceded to him a special revelation from God:</p>
<p>A man who can by pure intuition comprehend ideas which are</p>
<p>neither contained in, nor deducible from, the foundation of our</p>
<p>natural knowledge, must necessarily possess a mind far superior
to</p>
<p>those of his fellow men; nor do I believe that any have been so
en-</p>
<p>dowed save Christ. To him the ordinances of God leading to salvation
were revealed directly without words or visions, so that God mani-</p>
<p>fested himself to the Apostles through the mind of Christ, as he</p>
<p>formerly did to Moses through the supernatural voice. In this
sense</p>
<p>the voice of Christ, like the voice which Moses heard, may be called
the voice of God; and it may be said that the wisdom of God (wisdom more
than human*) took upon itself in Christ human nature, and that Christ
was the way of salvation. I must at this juncture declare that</p>
<p>those doctrines, which certain churches put forward concerning</p>
<p>Christ, I neither affirm nor deny, for I freely confess that I do
not</p>
<p>understand them. . . . Christ communed with God mind to mind.</p>
<p>Thus we may conclude that no one except Christ received the revela-
tion of God without the aid of imagination, whether in words or</p>
<p>vision . 39</p>
<p>This olive branch offered to the Christian leaders could not
conceal</p>
<p>from them that the Tractatus theologico-politicus was one of the
boldest pronouncements yet made in the conflict between religion and
philosophy.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Hardly had it appeared when the church council of Amsterdam (June
30,</p>
<ol start="1670" type="1">
<li>protested to the Grand Pensionary of Holland that so heretical a
volume should be allowed to circulate in a Christian state. A synod at
The Hague, petitioned him to ban and confiscate “such soul
-destroying</li>
</ol>
<p>books.” 40 Lay critics jo ined in the attack upon Spinoza; one called
him Satan incarnate; 41 Jean Le Clerc described him as “the most famous
atheist of our time”; 42 Lambert van Velthuysen accused him of “craftily
introduc - ing atheism . . . destroying all worship and religion from
the very founda- tion.” 43 Luckily for Spinoza, the Grand Pensionary,
Jan de Witt, was one of his admirers, who had already conferred upon him
a small pension. As long as de Witt lived and ruled, Spinoza could rely
on his protection. That was to be for only two years.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>THE PHILOSOPHER</li>
</ol>
<p>In May, 1670, shortly after publication of the Tractatus, Spinoza
moved to The Hague, perhaps to be nearer to de Witt and other
influential</p>
<p>friends. For a year he stayed in the house of the Widow van Velen;
then he passed to the home of Hendrik van der Spyck on the
Pavilioensgracht; this building was bought in 1927 by an international
committee, and is preserved as the Domus Spinozana. There he remained to
the end of his life. He occupied one room on the top floor, and slept in
a bed that during the day could be folded into the wall. 44 He “was
sometimes three whole months without stepping out of doors,” Bayle
tells; perhaps his con - sumptive lungs made him fearful of the winter
damp. But he had many visitors, and (again according to Bayle) he
occasionally “visited persons of importance … to discourse of state
affairs,” which “he understood well.” 45 He continued to polish lenses;
Christian Huygens commented on their excellence. 46 He kept an account
of his expenditures; we learn there- from that he lived on four and a
half sous per day. His friends insisted on helping him, for they must
have seen that his confinement to the house, and the dust from his lens
polishing, were aggravating his constitutional ailment.</p>
<p>The protection that he received from Jan de Witt ended when a mob
assassinated both the de Witt brothers in the streets of The Hague
(August 20, 1672). Hearing of the murder, Spinoza wished to go out and
denounce the crowd to its face as ultimi barbarorum, the lowest
barbarians, but his host locked the door and prevented him from leaving
the house. 47 Jan de Witt’s will left Spinoza an annuity of two hundred
francs. 48 * After the</p>

<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>631</p>
<p>death of de Witt the civil power fell to Prince William Henry, who
needed the support of the Calvinist clergy. When a second edition of the
Tractatus theologico-politicus appeared in 1674, the Prince and the
Council of Hol- land issued a decree prohibiting the sale of the book;
and in 1675 the Calvinist consistory of The Hague published a
proclamation bidding all citizens to report at once any attempt to print
any writing by Spinoza. 49 Between 1650 and 1680 there were some fifty
edicts, by church authorities, against the reading or circulation of the
philosopher’s works. 60</p>
<p>Perhaps such prohibitions shared in spreading his fame into Germany,
England, and France. On February 16, 1673, Johann Fabritius, professor
in the University of Heidelberg, wrote “to the very acute and renowned
Philosopher Benedictus de Spinoza” in the name of the liberal Elector of
the Palatinate, Prince Charles Louis:</p>
<p>His Serene Highness … has commanded me to write to you . . . and</p>
<p>ask whether you are willing to accept an ordinary professorship
of</p>
<p>philosophy in his illustrious university. You will be paid the
annual</p>
<p>salary which the ordinary professors enjoy today. You will not
find</p>
<p>elsewhere a prince more favorable to distinguished geniuses, among
whom he reckons you. You will have the utmost freedom of</p>
<p>philosophizing, which he believes you will not misuse to disturb
the</p>
<p>publicly established religion . . .</p>
<p>Spinoza replied on March 30:</p>
<p>MOST HONORABLE SIR:</p>
<p>If I had ever experienced a wish to take on a professorship in
any</p>
<p>faculty, I could have desired no other than that which is offered
me</p>
<p>through you by his Serene Highness the Elector Palatine. . . .
Since,</p>
<p>however, it was never my intention to give public instruction, I
can-</p>
<p>not be induced to embrace this glorious opportunity … For first,</p>
<p>I think that if I want to find time for instructing youth, then I
must</p>
<p>desist from developing my philosophy. Secondly, … I do not know</p>
<p>within what limits that freedom of philosophizing ought to be
con-</p>
<p>fined in order to avoid the appearance of wishing to disturb the</p>
<p>publicly established religion. For schisms arise not so much from
an</p>
<p>ardent love of religion as from men’s various dispositions, or the
love of contradiction. … I have already experienced these things
while</p>
<p>leading a private and solitary life; much more then are they to
be</p>
<p>feared after I shall have risen to this degree of dignity. Thus you
see, Most Honored Sir, that I am not holding back in the hope of
some</p>
<p>better fortune, but from love of peace. 51</p>
<p>Spinoza was fortunate in his refusal, for in the following year
Turenne devastated the Palatinate, and the university was closed.</p>
<p>6 32</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>In May, 1673, amid the invasion of the United Provinces by a French
army, an invitation came to Spinoza from a colonel in that army to visit
the Great Conde at Utrecht. Spinoza consulted the Dutch authorities, who
may have seen in the invitation an opportunity to open negotiations for
a desperately needed truce. Both sides gave him safe-conducts, and the
philosopher made his way to Utrecht. Meanwhile Conde had been sent
elsewhere by Louis XIV; he sent word (according to Lucas 52 ) asking
Spinoza to wait for him; but after several weeks another message said
that he was indefinitely delayed. It was apparently at this time that
Marechal de Luxembourg advised Spinoza to dedicate a book to Louis,
assuring him of a liberal response from the King. 53 Nothing came of the
proposal. Spinoza returned to The Hague, to find that many citizens
suspected him of treason. A hostile crowd gathered about his house,
shouting insults and throwing stones. “Do not be troubled,” he told his
landlord; “I am in - nocent, and there are many … in high places who
well know why I went to Utrecht. As soon as you hear any disturbance at
your door I will go out to the people, even if they should treat me as
they treated the good de Witt. I am an honest republican, and the
welfare of the Republic is my aim.” 54 His host would not let him go,
and the crowd dispersed.</p>
<p>He was now forty-one. A portrait in the Domus Spinozana at The Hague
shows him as a fine type of Sephardic Jew, with flowing black hair,
heavy eyebrows, black, bright, and slightly somber eyes, a long straight
nose, altog ether a rather handsome face, if only in comparison with
Hals’s Descartes. “He was extremely neat in his appearance,” reported
Lucas, “and never left his house without wearing clothes that
distinguished the gentleman from the pedant.” 55 His manners wer e grave
but amiable. Olden- burg noted his “solid learning combined with
humanity and refinement.” 56 “Those who have been acquainted with
Spinoza,” wrote Bayle, “. . . all say that he was sociable, affable,
honest, friendly, and a good moral man.” 57 To his neighbors he spoke no
heresy; on the contrary, he encouraged them to continue their church
attendance, and occasionally he accompanied them to hear a sermon. 58
More than any other modern philosopher he achieved a tranquillity bom of
self-control. He rarely replied to criticism; he dealt with ideas rather
than personalities. Despite his determinism, his uprooting from his
people, and his illness, he was far from being a pessi- mist. “Act
well,” he said, “and rejoice.” 59 To know the worst and believe the best
might have been the motto of his thought.</p>
<p>Friends and admirers made a path to his door. Walter von Tschirnhaus
persuaded him to let him see the manuscript of the Ethics . “I beg you,”
wrote the mathematician- physicist, “to help me with your usual courtesy
wherever I do not rightly grasp your meaning.” 60 Probably through this
eager student Leibniz won access to Spinoza (1676), and presumably
to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>the still unpublished masterpiece. The surviving members of
Dr. Meyer’s circle in Amsterdam came to see him, or were among his
correspondents. His letters to and from European scholars shed
unexpected light upon the intellectual climate of the time. Hugo Boxel
repeatedly urged him to admit the reality of ghosts. In 1675 the
anatomist Steno sent from Florence a touching appeal for Spinoza’s
conversion to Catholicism:</p>
<p>If you wish, I shall willingly take upon myself the task of
showing</p>
<p>you . . . wherein your teachings are behind ours, although I
should</p>
<p>wish that you . . . would offer to God a refutation of your own
errors … in order that if your first writings have turned aside a
thousand</p>
<p>souls from the true knowledge of God, the recantation of them, rein-
forced by your own example, may lead back to him a thousand</p>
<p>thousand with you as with another Augustine. I pray with all my heart
that this grace may be yours. Farewell . 61</p>
<p>The fascination of Catholicism captured also Albert Burgh, son of</p>
<p>Spinoza’s friend Conraad Burgh, treasurer general of the United
Provinces. Albert, like Steno, had become a convert while traveling in
Italy. In</p>
<p>September, 1675, he wrote to Spinoza not so much soliciting as
challenging him to accept the Roman Catholic faith:</p>
<p>How do you know that your philosophy is the best among all those</p>
<p>which have ever been taught in the world, or are actually taught now,
or ever will be taught in the future? . . . Have you examined all those
philosophies, ancient as well as modern, which are taught here and in
India and everywhere throughout the world? And even if you have</p>
<p>duly examined them, how do you know that you have chosen the</p>
<p>best? . . .</p>
<p>If, however, you do not believe in Christ, you are more wretched</p>
<p>than I can say. But the remedy is easy: return from your sins,
and</p>
<p>realize the fatal arrogance of your wretched and insane reasoning. .
. .</p>
<p>Will you, you wretched little man, vile worm of the earth, . . .
dare, in your unspeakable blasphemy, to put yourself above the
Incarnate,</p>
<p>Infinite Wisdom? . . .</p>
<p>From your principles you will not explain thoroughly even one of</p>
<p>those things which are accomplished in witchcraft . . . , nor will
you</p>
<p>be able to explain any of the stupendous phenomena among those who
are possessed by demons, of all of which I have myself seen various
instances, and I have heard most certain evidence . 62</p>
<p>Spinoza, in part, replied (December, 1675):</p>
<p>What I could scarcely believe when it was related me by others, I</p>
<p>at last understand from your letter; that is, that not only have
you</p>
<p>634</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>become a member of the Roman Church . . . but that you are a very
keen champion of it, and have already learned to curse and rage</p>
<p>petulantly against your opponents. I had not intended to reply to
your letter, . . . but certain friends who with me had formed great
hopes</p>
<p>for you from your natural talent, earnestly prayed me not to fail
in</p>
<p>the duty of a friend, and to think rather of what you recently
were</p>
<p>than of what you now are I have been induced by these arguments</p>
<p>to write to you these words, earnestly begging you to be kind enough
to read them with a calm mind.</p>
<p>I will not here recount the vices of priests and popes to turn
you</p>
<p>away from them, as the opponents of the Roman Church are wont to do.
For they usually publish these things from ill-feeling, and … in</p>
<p>order to annoy rather than instruct. Indeed, I will admit that there
are found more men of great learning, and of an upright life, in the
Roman than in any other Christian Church; for since there are more . . .
mem- bers of this Church, there will also be found in it more men of
every condition. … In every Church there are many very honest men
who</p>
<p>worship God with justice and charity . . . For justice and charity
are</p>
<p>the surest sign of the true Catholic faith . . . , and wherever these
are found, there Christ really is, and where they are lacking, there
Christ also is not. For by the spirit of Christ alone can we be led to
the love of justice and charity. If you had been willing duly to ponder
these</p>
<p>facts within yourself, you would not have been lost, nor would
you</p>
<p>have caused bitter sorrow to your parents. . . .</p>
<p>Your asked me, how I know that my philosophy is the best among</p>
<p>all those which have ever been taught in the world, or are taught
now, or will be taught in the future. This, indeed, I can ask you with
far</p>
<p>better right. For I do not presume that I have found the best
philoso- phy, but I know that I think 〔it〕 the true one. . . . But you
who pre-</p>
<p>sume that you have at last found the best religion, or rather the
best men, to whom you have given over your credulity, how do you know
that they are the best among all those who have taught other religions,
or are teaching them now, or will teach them in the future? Have</p>
<p>you examined all those religions, both ancient and modern, which</p>
<p>are taught here and in India, and everywhere throughout the
world?</p>
<p>And even if you have duly examined them, how do you know that</p>
<p>you have chosen the best? . . .</p>
<p>Do you regard it as arrogance and pride because I use my reason,</p>
<p>and acquiesce in that true Word of God which is in the mind and can
never be depraved or corrupted? Away with this deadly superstition;
acknowledge the reason which God has given you, and cultivate it, if you
would not be numbered among the brutes. … If you will . . .</p>
<p>examine the histories of the Church (of which I see you are most</p>
<p>ignorant), in order to see how false are many of the Pontifical
tradi- tions, and by what . . . arts the Roman Pontiff, six hundred
years after the birth of Christ, obtained sovereignty over the Church, I
doubt not</p>

<p>Burgh joined the Franciscan order, and died in a monastery in
Rome.</p>
<p>Most of Spinoza’s extant correspondence was with Oldenburg. We are
surprised to find that much of it deals with science, that Spinoza
carried on experiments in physics and chemistry, and that his letters
are illustrated with many diagrams. This correspondence was interrupted
in 1665. Olden- burg was arrested in 1667, and was held in the Tower of
London on suspicion of dealing with a foreign power. On his release he
turned to religion, and when he resumed correspondence with Spinoza
(1675) he joined in the effort to win him back to some form of orthodox
Christianity. He begged him to take the story of Christ’s resurrection
not allegorically but literally. “The whole Christian religion and its
truth,” he thought, “rests on this article of the Resurrection; and if
it is taken away, the mis - sion of Christ and his hea venly teaching
collapse.” 64 He finally gave up Spinoza as a lost soul, and
discontinued the correspondence (1677).</p>
<p>All through the years from 1662 Spinoza had been working on the</p>
<p>Ethics. As early as April, 1662, he wrote to Oldenburg that he was
think- ing of publishing it, but “I am naturally afraid lest the
theologians . . . take offense, and with their usual hatred attack me,
who utterly loathe quar- rels.” 65 Oldenburg urged him to publish,
“however much the theological quacks may growl,” 66 bu t Spinoza still
hesitated. He allowed some friends to read parts of the manuscript, and
probably profited from their com- ments, for he repeatedly revised the
treatise. The clamor aroused by the Tractatus theologico-politicus
justified his caution. The murder of the de Witts, and the suspicions
directed against him after his visit to the French army, further
troubled him; and it was not till 1675 that he made another move to put
the Ethics into print. He reported the results to Oldenburg:</p>
<p>At the time when I received your letter of 22 July, I was setting</p>
<p>out for Amsterdam with the intention of getting printed the work</p>
<p>about which I have written to you. While I was engaged in this matter
a rumor was spread everywhere that a book of mine about God was in the
press, and that in it I endeavored to show that there is no God.</p>
<p>This rumor was believed by many. Therefore certain theologians . . .
seized the opportunity of bringing complaints against me before the
Prince and the magistrates. . . . When I heard all this … I decided
to</p>
<p>postpone the publication I was preparing. 67</p>
<p>He put the manuscript away, and turned to writing a treatise on the
state, Tractatus politicus, but death came upon him before he could
finish it.</p>
<p>On February 6, 1677, Georg Hermann Schuller, a young physician.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>wrote to Leibniz: “I fear that Mr. Benedictus Spinoza will soon leave
us, as the consumption . . . seems to grow worse every day.” 68 Two
weeks later, while the rest of the household were absent, the
philosopher entered upon his final suffering. Schuller alone (not Meyer,
as formerly supposed) was with him at the time. Spinoza left
instructions that his modest be- longings be sold to pay his debts, and
that such manuscripts as he had not burned be published anonymously. He
died on February 20, 1677, with- out any religious ministrations. 69 He
was buried in a cemetery of the New Church of The Hague, near the tomb
of Jan de Witt. The manuscripts — chiefly the Ethics, the Tractatus
politicus, and the treatise On the Improve- ment of the Intellect — were
prepared for the press by Meyer, Schuller, and others, and were printed
at Amsterdam toward the end of 1677.</p>
<p>And so we come at last to the book into which Spinoza had poured his
life and solitary soul.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>GOD</li>
</ol>
<p>He called it Ethica ordine geometrico demonstrata, first because
he</p>
<p>thought of all philosophy as a preparation for right conduct and wise
living, and second because, like Descartes, he envied the intellectual
asceticism and logical sequence of geometry. He hoped to build, on the
model of Euclid, a structure of reasoning in which every step would fol-
low logically from preceding proofs, and these would at last be
irrefutably derived from axioms universally received. He knew that this
was an ideal, and he could hardly have supposed it proof against error,
for he had by a similar method expounded the Cartesian philosophy, with
which he did not agree. At least the geometrical scheme would make for
clarity; it would check the confusion of reason by passion, and the
concealment of sophistry with eloquence. He proposed to discuss the
behavior of men, and even the nature of God, as calmly and objectively
as if he were dealing with circles, triangles, and squares. His
procedure was not faultless, but it led him to rear an edifice of reason
imposing in its architectural grandeur and unity. The method is
deductive, and would have been frowned upon by Francis Bacon; but it
claimed to be in harmony with all experience.</p>
<p>Spinoza began with definitions, mostly taken from medieval
philosophy. The words he used have changed their meaning since his day,
and now some of them obscure his thought. The third definition is
fundamental: “I understand Substance to be that which is in itself and
is conceived through itself; I mean that, the conception of which does
not depend upon the conception of another thing f rom which it must be
formed.” He does not mean substance in the modern sense of material
constituents; our use</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SPINOZA 637</p>
<p>of the word to mean essence or basic significance comes closer to his
intent. If we take literally his Latin term substantia, it indicates
that which stands under, underlies, supports. In his correspondence 70
he speaks of “substance or being”; i.e., he identifies substance with
existence or reality. Hence he can say that “existence appertains to the
nature of substance,” that in sub - stance, essence and existence are
one . 71 We may conclude that in Spinoza substance means the essential
reality underlying all things.</p>
<p>This reality is perceived by us in two forms: as extension or
matter,</p>
<p>and as thought or mind. These two are “attributes” of substance; not
as qualities residing in it, but as the same reality perceived
externally by our senses as matter, and internally by our consciousness
as thought. Spinoza is a complete monist: these two aspects of reality —
matter and thought — are not distinct and separate entities, they are
two sides, the outside and the inside, of one reality; so are body and
mind, so is physiological action and the corresponding mental state.
Strictly speaking, Spinoza, so far from being a materialist, is an
ideaYist: he defines an attribute as “that which the</p>
<p>Nature has two aspects. As the power of motion in bodies, and as the
power of generation, growth, and feeling in organisms, it is natura
naturans</p>
<p>6 3 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>— nature “creating” or giving birth. As the sum of all individual
things, of all bodies, plants, animals, and men, it is natura naturata —
generated or “created” nature. These individual entities in generated
nature are called by Spinoza modi, modes — transient modifications and
embodiments of substance, reality, matter-mind, God. They are part of
substance, but in our perception we distinguish them as passing,
fleeting forms of an eternal whole. This stone, this tree, this man,
this planet, this star — all this marvel- ous kaleidoscope of appearing
and dissolving individual forms — constitute that “temporal order”
which, in On the Improvement of the Intellect, Spinoza contrasted with
the “eternal order” that in a stricter sense is the underlying reality
and God:</p>
<p>By series of causes and real entities I do not understand … a
series</p>
<p>of individual mutable things, but the series of fixed and eternal
things.</p>
<p>For it would be impossible for human weakness to follow up the</p>

<p>dividual and mutable things depend so intimately and essentially (so
to speak) on these fixed ones, that without them they can neither exist
nor be conceived . 74</p>
<p>So a single, specific triangle is a mode; it may but need not exist;
but if it does it will have to obey the laws — and will have the powers
— of the triangle in general. A specific man is a mode; he may or may
not exist; but if he does he will share in the essence and power of
matter-mind, and will have to obey the laws that govern the operations
of bodies and thoughts. These powers and laws constitute the order of
nature as natura naturans; they constitute, in theological terms, the
will of God. The modes of matter in their totality are the body of God;
the modes of mind in their totality, are the mind of God; substance or
reality, in all its modes and attributes, is God; “whatever is, is in
God .” 76</p>
<p>Spinoza agrees with the Scholastic philosophers that in God essence
and existence are one — His existence is involved in our conception of
His essence, for he conceives God as all existence itself. He agrees
with the Scholastics that God is causa sui, self-caused, for there is
nothing outside him. He agrees with the Scholastics that we can know the
existence of God, but not his real nature in all his attributes. He
agrees with St. Thomas Aquinas that to apply the masculine pronouns to
God is absurd but con-</p>

<p>venient.* He agrees with Maimonides that most of the qualities we
ascribe to God are conceived by weak analogy with human qualities.</p>
<p>God is described as the lawgiver or prince, and styled just,
merciful, etc., merely in concession to popular understanding and the
imper-</p>
<p>fection of popular knowledge 77 . . . God is free from passions, nor
is he affected with any emotion 〔afjectus〕 of joy or sorrow 78 . . .
Those who confuse divine with human nature easily attribute human
passions to God, especially if they do not know how passions are
produced in the mind . 79</p>
<p>God is not a person, for that means a particular and finite mind; but
God is the total of all the mind (all the animation, sensitivity, and
thought) — as well as of all the matter — in existence . 80 “The hum an
mind is part of a certain infinite intellect” 81 (as in the Aristotelian
-Alexandrian tradition). But “if intellect and will appertain to the
eternal essence of God, some - thing far else must be understood by
these two attributes than what is common ly understood by men .” 82 “The
actual intellect, . . . together with will, desire, love, etc., must be
referred to the natura naturata, not to the natura naturans” ; 83 that
is, individual minds, with their desires, emotions, and volitions, are
modes or modifications, contained in God as the totality of things, but
not pertaining to Him as the law and life of the world. There is will in
God, but only in the sense of the laws operating every- where. His will
is law.</p>

<p>640 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>desires or designs, except as the totality contains all the desires
and designs of all modes and therefore of all organisms. In nature there
are only effects following inevitably from antecedent causes and
inherent properties. There are no miracles, for the will of God and the
“fixed and unchanged order of nature” are one ; 87 any break in “the
chain of natural events” would be a self-contradiction.</p>
<p>Man is only a small part of the universe. Nature is neutral as
between man and other forms. We must not apply to nature or to God such
words as good or evil, beautiful or ugly; these are subjective terms, as
much so as hot or cold; they are determined by the contribution of the
external world to our advantage or displeasure.</p>
<p>The perfection of things is to be judged by their nature and
power</p>
<p>alone; nor are they more or less perfect because they delight or
offend the human senses, or because they are beneficial or prejudicial
to</p>
<p>human nature 88 … If, therefore, anything in nature seems to us</p>
<p>ridiculous, absurd, or evil, it is because we know only in part, and
are almost entirely ignorant of, the order and interdependence of nature
as a whole; and also because we want everything to be arranged</p>
<p>according to the dictates of our human reason. In reality that which
reason considers evil is not evil in respect to the order and laws
of</p>
<p>nature as a whole, but only in respect to the laws of our reason .
89</p>
<p>Likewise there is no beauty or ugliness in nature.</p>
<p>Beauty … is not so much a quality of the object beheld, as an
effect</p>
<p>in him who beholds it. If our sight were longer or shorter, if our
con- stitutions were different, what we now think beautiful we
should</p>
<p>think ugly. . . . The most beautiful hand, seen through the
microscope, will appear horrible 90 … I do not attribute to nature
either beauty or deformity, order or confusion. Only in relation to our
imagination</p>
<p>can things be called beautiful or ugly, well-formed, or confused .
91</p>
<p>Order is objective only in the sense that all things cohere in one
system of law; but in that order a destructive storm is as natural as
the splendor of a sunset or the sublimity of the sea.</p>
<p>Are we justified, on the basis of this “theology,” in calling Spinoza
an atheist? We have seen that he was not a materialist, for he did not
identify God with matter; he says quite clearly that “those who think
that the Tractatus 〔theologico-politicus〕 rests on the identification
of God with nature — taking nature in the sense of a certain mass of
corporeal matter — are entirely wrong .” 92 He conceived God as mind as
well as matter, and he did not reduce mind to matter; he acknowledged
that mind is the only reality directly known. He thought that something
akin to mind is mingled</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>641</p>
<p>with all matter; in this respect he was a panpsychist. He was a
pantheist, seeing God in all things, and all things in God. Bayle, Hume,
and others 93 considered him an atheist; and this term might seem
justified by Spinoza’s denial of feeling, desire, or purpose in God . 94
He himself, however, ob- jected to “the opinion which the common people
have of me, who do not cease to accuse me falsely of atheism .” 95
Apparently he felt that his ascrip - tion of mind and intelligence to
God absolved him from the charge of atheism. And it must be admitted
that he spoke repeatedly of his God in terms of religious reverence,
often in terms quite consonant with the con- ception of God in
Maimonides or Aquinas. Novalis would call Spinoza “der Gottbetrunkene
Mensch,” the God -intoxicated man.</p>
<p>Actually he was intoxicated with the whole order of nature, which in
its eternal consistency and movement seemed to him admirable and sub-
lime; and in Book I of the Ethics he wrote both a system of theology and
the metaphysics of science. In the world of law he felt a divine
revelation greater than any book, however noble and beautiful. The
scientist who studies that law, even in its pettiest and most prosaic
detail, is deciphering that revelation, for “the more we understand
indivi dual objects, the more we understand God .” 96 (This sentence
struck Goethe as one of the pro - foundest in all literature.) It seemed
to Spinoza that he had honestly ac- cepted and met the challenge
implicit in Copernicus — to reconceive deity in terms worthy of the
universe now progressively revealed. In Spinoza science and religion are
no longer in conflict; they are one.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>MIND</li>
</ol>
<p>Next to the nature and operation of the cosmos the greatest puzzle in
philosophy and science is the nature and operation of the mind. If it is
difficult to reconcile an omnipotent benevolence with the neutrality of
nature and the fatality of suffering, it seems just as hard to
understand how an apparently external and material object in space can
generate an appar- ently immaterial and spaceless idea, or how an idea
in the mind can become a motion in the body, or how idea can contemplate
idea in the mystery of consciousness.</p>
<p>Spinoza tries to avoid some of these problems by rejecting Descartes’
assumption that body and mind are two different substances. Body and
mind, he believes, are one and the same reality, perceived under two
differ- ent aspects or attributes, just as extension and thought are one
in God. There is then no problem of how body acts upon mind or vice
versa; every action is the simultaneous and unified operation of both
body and mind. Spinoza defines mind as “the idea of the body”; 97 i.e.,
it is the psycho -</p>
<p>642</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>logical (not necessarily the conscious) correlate or accompaniment of
a physiological process. The mind is the body felt from within; the body
is the mind seen from without. A mental state is the inside, or internal
aspect, of bodily action. An act of “will” is the mental accompaniment o
f a bodily desire that is moving into physical expression. There is no
action of the “will” upon the body; there is a single action of the
psychophysical (mental- material) organism; the “will” is not the cause,
it is the consciousness of the action. “The decision of the mind, and
the desire and determination of the body are . . . one and the same
thing, which, when considered under the at- tribute of thought . . . ,
we call a decision (decretum ) , and which, when considered under the
attribute of extension, and deduced from the laws of motion and rest, is
called a determination” (a finished action ). 98 Hence - taneous ,in
nature with the order and passions of the mi nd .” 99 In all cases of
the supposed interaction of mind and body the actual process is not the
interplay of two distinct realities, substances, or agents, but the
single action of one substance, which, seen from outside, we call body,
and which, seen from within, we call mind. To every process in the body
there is a corres- ponding process in the mind; “nothing can happen in
the body which is not perceived by the mind .” 100 But this mental
correlate need not be a thought; it may be a feeling; and it need not be
conscious; so a sleepwalker performs any number of actions while he is
“unconscious .” 101 This theory has been called “psychophysical
parallelism”; however, it supposes parallel processes not in two
different entities, but in one psychophysical unity doubly seen.</p>
<p>On this basis Spinoza proceeds to a mechanistic description of
the</p>
<p>knowledge process. Probably following Hobbes, he defines sensation,
mem- ory, and imagination in physical terms . 102 He takes it as evident
that most knowledge originates in impressions made upon us by external
objects; but he admits to the idealist that “the human mind perceives no
external body as actually existing save through ideas of modifications
in its body .” 103 Perception and reason, two forms of knowledge, are
derived from sensa- tion; but a third and higher form, “intuitive
knowledge,” is derived (Spi - noza thinks) not from sensation but from a
clear, distinct, immediate, and comprehensive awareness of an idea or
event as part of a universal system of law.</p>
<p>Anticipating Locke and Hume, Spinoza rejects the notion that the mind
is an agent or entity possessing ideas; “mind” is a general or abstract
term for the succession of perceptions, memories, imaginations,
feelings, and other mental states. “The idea of the mind, and the mind
itself” at any moment, “are one and the same thing .” 104 Nor are there
any distinct “fac - ulties” such as intellect or will; these also are
abst ract terms for the sum of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>643</p>
<p>cognitions or volitions; “intellect or will have reference in the
same manner to this or that idea, or to this or that volition, as
‘stoniness’ to this or that stone, or ‘man’ to Peter or Paul .” 105
Neither do idea and volition differ; a volition or act of “will” is
merely an idea that has “affirmed itself” 106 (i.e., has lasted long
enough to complete itself in an action, as ideas, if unimpeded,
automatically do). “The decision of the min d … is nothing but the
affirma- tion which the idea necessarily involves insofar as it is an
idea 107 . . . Will and intellect are one and the same thing .” 108</p>
<p>From another standpoint what we call will is simply the sum and play
of desires. “By desire … I understand all the efforts, impulses,
appetites, and volitions of a man, which . . . not infrequently are so
opposed to one another that he is drawn hither and thither, and knows
not where to turn .” 109 Deliberation is the alternating domination of
body-and-thought by conflicting desires; it ends when one desire proves
powerful enough to maintain its corresponding mental state long enough
to pass into action. Obviously (says Spinoza) there is no “free will”;
the will at a ny moment is just the strongest desire. We are free
insofar as we are allowed to express our nature or our desires without
external hindrance; we are not free to choose our own nature or our
desires; we are our desires. “There is in no mind absolute or free will,
but the mind is determined for willing this or that by a cause which is
determined in its turn by another cause, and this again by another, and
so on to infinity .” 110 “Men think themselves free because they are
conscious of their volitions and desires, but are ignorant of the causes
by which they are led to wish and desire”; 111 it is as if a stone flung
through space should think it is moving and falling of its own will .
112</p>
<p>Possibly the Calvinist fatalism in the “climate of opinion” that
Descartes and Spinoza lived in as residents of Holland may have shared
with the Galilean mechanics (Newton’s Principia had not yet appeared) in
molding the mechanistic theory in Descartes and the determinist
psychology in Spinoza. Determinism is predestinarianism without
theology; it substitutes the primeval vortex or nebula for God. Spinoza
followed the logic of mechanism to its bitter end; he did not, like
Descartes, confine it to bodies and animals; he applied it to minds as
well, as he had to, since to him mind and body were one. He concluded
that the body is a machine , 113 but he denied that determinism makes
morality useless or insincere. The exhorta- tions of the moralist, the
ideals of the philosophers, the stigma of public condemnation, and the
penalties of the courts are still valuable and neces- sary; they enter
into the heritage and experience of the growing individual, and
therefore into the factors that form his desires and determine his
will.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MAN</li>
</ol>
<p>Into this apparently static philosophy Spinoza inserts two dynamic
ele- ments: first and generally, that matter and mind are everywhere
united, that all things are animated, that they have in them something
akin to what in ourselves we call mind or will; second and specifically,
that this vital ele- ment includes in everything a conatus sese
preservandi — an “effort at self - preservation.” “Everything insofar as
it is in itself endeavors to preserve its own being,” and “the power or
endeavor of anything … to persist in its own being is nothing else than
. . . the essence of that . . . thing .” 114 Like the Scholastic
philosophers who said that esse est agere (to be is to act) and that God
is actus purus (pure activity) ; like Schopenhauer, who saw in will the
essence of all things; like those modem physicists who reduce matter to
energy — Spinoza defines the essence of each being through its powers of
action; “the power of God is the same as his essence”; 115 in this
aspect God is energy (and energy might be named, in addition to matter
and mind, as a third attribute which we perceive as constituting the
essence of substance or reality). Spinoza follows Hobbes in ranking
entities according to their capacity for action and effectiveness. “The
perfection of things is estimated solely from their nature and power”
116 — but in Spinoza perfect means per-f actum, complete.</p>
<p>Consequently he defines virtue as a power of acting or doing; “by
virtue and power ( potentia ) I understand the same thing”; 117 but we
shall see that this “potency” means power over ourselves perhaps even
more than power over others . 118 “The more each one seeks what is
useful to him — i.e., the more he endeavors and is able to preserve his
being — the more he is endowed with virtue. . . . The endeavor to
preserve oneself is the only basis of virtue .” 119 In Spinoza virtue is
biological, almost Darwinian; it is any quality that makes for survival.
In this sense, at least, virtue is its own reward; “it is to be desired
for its own sake; nor is there anything more excellent or more useful to
us . . . for the sake of which virtue ought to be desired .” 120</p>
<p>As the endeavor for self- preservation (the “struggle for existence”)
is the active essence of anything, all motives derive from it, and are
ultimately self- seeking. “Since reason postulates nothing against natur
e, it postulates, therefore, that each man should love himself, and seek
what is useful to him — I mean what is truly useful to him — and desire
whatever leads man truly to a greater state of perfection
〔completion〕, and finally that each one should endeavor to preserve
his being as far as in him lies .” 121 These desires need not be
conscious; they may be unconscious appetites lodged in our flesh. Taken
altogether, they constitute the essence of man . 122 We judge all</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>645</p>
<p>things in terms of our desires. “We do not strive for, wish, seek, or
desire anything because we think it to be good; we judge a thing to be
good because we . . . desire it .” 123 “By good ( bonum ) I understand
that which we certainly kno w to be useful to us .” 124 (Here is
Bentham’s utilitarianism in one sentence.)</p>
<p>All our desires aim at pleasure or the avoidance of pain. “Pleasure
is man’s transition from a lesser state of perfection 〔completion,
fulfill - ment 〕.” 125 Pleasure accom panies any experience or feeling
that enhances the bodily-mental processes of activity and self-
advancement . 126 “Joy consists in this, that one’s power is increased.”
127 * Any feeling that de - presses our vitality is a weakness rather
than a virtue. The healthy man will soon slough off the feelings of
sadness, repentance, humility, and pity ; 129 however, he will be
readier than the weak man to render aid, for generosity is the
superabundance of confident strength. Any pleasure is legitimate if it
does not hinder a greater or more lasting pleasure. Spinoza, like
Epicurus, recommends intellectual pleasures as the best, but he has a
good word for a great variety of pleasures.</p>
<p>There cannot be too much merriment. . . . Nothing save gloomy</p>
<p>. . . superstition prohibits laughter. . . . To make use of things,
and take delight in them as much as possible (not indeed to satiety, for
that is not . . . delight), is the part of a wise man; … to feed himself
with</p>
<p>moderate pleasant food and drink, and to take pleasure with
perfumes,</p>
<p>. . . plants, dress, music, sports, and theaters . 130</p>
<p>The trouble with the conception of pleasure as the realization of
desires is that desires may conflict; only in the wise man do they fall
into a har- monious hierarchy. A desire is usually the conscious
correlate of an appetite which is rooted in the body; and so much of the
appetite may remain un- conscious that we have only “confused and
inadequate ideas” of its causes and results. Such confused desires
Spinoza called affectus, which may be translated by emotions. He defines
these as “modifications of the body by which the power of action in the
body is increased or diminished . . . and at the same time t he ideas of
these modifications” 131 — a definition vaguely recognizing the role of
internal (endocrine) secretions in emotion, and remarkably anticipating
the theory of C. G. Lange and William James that the bodily expression
of an emotion is the direct and instinctive result of the cause, and
that the conscious feeling is an accompaniment or result, not a cause,
of the bodily expression and response. Spinoza proposed to study the
emotions — love, hate, anger, fear, etc. — and the power of reason
over</p>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche echoes these definitions. “What is good? All that enhances
the feeling of power . . . What is happiness? The feeling that power is
increasing .” 128</li>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>them, “in the same manner … as if I were dealing with lines, planes,
and bodies”; 132 not to praise or denounce them but to understand them;
for “the more an emotion becomes known to us, the more it is within our
power, and the less the mind i s passive to it.” 183 The resulting
analysis of the emotions owed something to Descartes, perhaps more to
Hobbes, but it so improved upon them that when Johannes Muller, in his
epochal Physio- logic des Menschen (1840), came to treat of the
emotions, he wrote: “With regard to the relations of the passions to one
another, apart from their physiological conditions, it is impossible to
give any better account than that which Spinoza has laid down with
unsurpassed mastery” 134 — and he proceeded to quote extensively from
the Ethics.</p>
<p>An emotion becomes a passion when, through our confused and inade-
quate ideas of its origin and significance, its external cause dictates
our feeling and response, as in hatred, anger, or fear. “The m ind is
more or less subject to passions according as it has more or less
adequate ideas.” 188 A man with poor powers of perception and thought is
especially subject to passion; it is such a life that Spinoza describes
in his classic Book IV, “Of Human Bondage.” Such a man, however violent
his action may be, is really passive — is swept along by an external
stimulus instead of holding his hand and taking thought. “We are driven
about by external causes in many ways, and, like waves driven by
contrary winds, we waver and are uncon- scious of the issue and our
fate.” 186</p>
<p>Can we free ourselves from this bondage, and become in some measure
the masters of our lives?</p>
<p>vn. REASON</p>
<p>Never completely, for we remain part of nature, subject (as Napoleon
wa s to say) to “the nature of things.” And since the emotions are our
motive force, and reason can be only a fight and not a fire, “an emotion
can neither be hindered nor removed save by a contrary and stronger emo-
tion.” 137 Hence society rightly seeks to moderate our passions by
appealing to our love of praise and rewards, our fear of blame and
punishment. 138 And society rightly labors to instill in us a sense of
right and wrong as another check to passion. Conscience, of course, is a
social product, not an innate endowment or divine gift. 189</p>
<p>But to use the imaginary rewards and punishments of a fife after
death as stimulants to morality is an encouragement to superstition and
quite un- worthy of a mature society. Virtue should be — and is — its
own reward, if we define it, like men, as ability, intelligence, and
strength, and not, like cowards, as obedience, humility, and fear.
Spinoza resented the Christian view of fife as a vale of tears, and of
death as a door to heaven or hell; this,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>647</p>
<p>he felt, casts a pall over human affairs, clouding with the notion of
sin the legitimate aspirations and enjoyments of men. To be daily
thinking of dea th is an insult to life. “A free man thinks of nothing
less than of death, and his wisdom is a meditation not on death but on
life .” 140</p>
<p>Nevertheless Spinoza seems at times to flutter around the idea of
immor- tality. His theory of mind and body as two aspects of the same
reality com- mitted him in logic to view their death as simultaneous. He
affirms this quite clearly: “The present existence of the mind, and its
power of imagin - ing, are taken away as soon as the mind ceases to
affirm the present existence of the body”; 141 and again: “The mind can
imagine nothing, nor can it re - collect anything that is past, except
while the body exists .” 142 In Book V some hazy distinction s appear.
“If we look at the common opinion of men, we shall see that they are
indeed conscious of the eternity of their minds, but they confound this
with duration, and attribute it to imagination and mem- ory, which they
believe remain after death .” 143 Insofar as the mind is a series of
temporal ideas, memories, and imaginations connected with a particular
body, it ceases to exist when that body dies; this is the mortal
duration of the mind. But insofar as the human mind conceives things in
their eternal relationships as part of the universal and unchanging
system of natural law, it sees things as in God; it becomes to that
extent part of the divine eternal mind, and is eternal.</p>
<p>Things are conceived as actual in two ways by us, either insofar
as</p>
<p>we conceive them to exist with relation to certain time and space, or
insofar as we conceive them to be contained in God 〔the eternal</p>
<p>order and laws〕, and to follow from the necessity of the divine
nature 〔those laws〕. But those things which are conceived in this
second</p>
<p>manner as true or real we conceive under a certain species of
eternity 〔sub quadam specie etemitatis — in their eternal aspect〕, and
their</p>
<p>ideas involve the eternal and infinite essence of God . 144</p>
<p>When we see things in that timeless way we see them as God sees them;
our minds to that extent become part of the divine mind, and share
eternity.</p>
<p>We attribute to the human mind no duration which can be defined</p>
<p>by time. But as there is nevertheless something else which is
conceived under a certain eternal necessity through the essence of God,
this</p>
<p>something will be necessarily the eternal part which appertains to
the mind 148 . . . We are certain that the mind is eternal insofar as it
con- ceives things under the species of eternity . 146</p>
<p>Let us suppose that in contemplating the majestic sequence of
apparent cause and effect according to apparently everlasting laws,
Spinoza felt that through “divine philosophy” he had escaped, like some
sinless Buddha, from</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>648</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>the chain of time, and had shared in the viewpoint and tranquillity
of an eternal mind.</p>
<p>Despite this seeming reach for the moon, Spinoza devoted most of his
concluding Book V, “Of Human Liberty,” to formulating a natural ethic, a
fount and system of morals independent of survival after death, though
fondly using religious terms. One sentence reveals his starting point:
“An emotion which is a passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form
a clear and distinct idea of it” 147 — that is, an emotion aroused in us
by external events can be reduced from passion to controlled feeling by
letting our knowledge play upon it until its cause and nature become
clear, and its result in action can, through remembered experience, be
foreseen. One method of clearing up an emotional state is to see the
events that begot it as part of a chain of natural causes and necessary
effects. “I nsofar as the mind understands all things as necessary, it
has more power over the emo- tions, and is less passive to them” 148 —
less given to passions. No one be- comes passionate at what he considers
natural and necessary. Anger at an insult can be cooled by viewing the
offender as the product of circum- stances outreaching his control;
grief over the passing of aged parents can be moderated by realizing the
naturalness of death. “The endeavor to un - derstand is the first and
only basis of virtue ,” 149 in Spinoza’s sense of this word, for it
reduces our subjection to external factors, and increases our power to
control and preserve ourselves. Knowledge is power; but the best and
most useful form of that power is power over ourselves.</p>
<p>So Spinoza works his Euclidean way to the life of reason. Recalling
his three kinds of knowledge, he describes merely sensory knowledge as
leav- ing us too open to domination by external influences; rational
knowledge (reached by reasoning) as gradually freeing us from bondage to
the pas- sions by letting us see the impersonal and determined causes of
events; and intuitive knowledge — direct awareness of the cosmic order —
as making us feel ourselves part of that order and “one with God.” “We
should expect and bear both faces of fortune with an equal mind; for all
things follow by the eternal decree of God in the same way as it follows
from the essence of a triangle that its three angles will make two right
angles .” 150 This escape from thoughtless passion is the only true
freedom ; 151 and he who achieves it, as the Stoics used to say, can be
free in almost any condition in any state. The greatest gift that
knowledge can give us is to see ourselves as reason sees us.</p>
<p>On this naturalistic basis Spinoza arrives at some ethical
conclusions sur- prisingly like Christ’s:</p>
<p>He who rightly knows that all things follow from the necessity of</p>
<p>divine nature, and come to pass according to eternal, natural,
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>649</p>
<p>regular laws, will find nothing at all that is worthy of hatred,
laughter, or contempt, nor will he deplore anyone; but as far as human
virtue can go, he will endeavor to act well . . . and rejoice . 152 . .
. Those who cavil at men, and prefer rather to reprobate vices than to
inculcate</p>
<p>virtues . . . , are a nuisance both to themselves and to others . 153

is</p>
<p>indignant with no one, and is in no wise proud . 154 . . . He who
lives under the guidance of reason endeavors as much as possible to
repay hatred, rage, contempt, etc., with love and nobleness. . . . He
who</p>
<p>wishes to avenge injuries by reciprocal hatred will live in

<p>Hatred is increased by reciprocated hatred, and, on the contrary, can
be demolished by love . 155 . . . Men under the guidance of reason . . .
desire nothing for themselves which they do not also desire for the</p>
<p>rest of mankind . 156</p>
<p>Does this control of emotion by reason contradict, as some 157 have
thought, Spinoza’s admission that only an emotion can overcome an emo -
tion? It would unless the following of reason could itself be raised to
an emotional level and warmth. “A tr ue knowledge of good and evil
cannot restrain any emotion insofar as the knowledge is true, but only
insofar as it is considered as an emotion .” 158 This need, and perhaps
a desire to kindle reason with phrases hallowed by piety and time, led
Spinoza to the final and culminating thought of his work — that the life
of reason must be in- spired and ennobled by the “intellectual love of
God.” Since God, in Spi - noza, is the basic reality and invariable law
of the cosmos itself, this amor intellectuals dei is not the abject
propitiation of some nebular sultan, but the wise and willing adjustment
of our ideas and conduct to the nature of things and the order of the
world. Reverence for the will of God and an understanding acceptance of
the laws of nature are one and the same thing. Just as the mathematician
finds a certain awe and ecstasy in viewing the world as subject to
mathematical regularities, so the philosopher may take the deepest
pleasure in contemplating the grandeur of a universe moving
imperturbably in the rhythm of universal law. Since “love is pleasure ac
- companied by the idea of an external cause ,” 159 the pleasure we
derive from viewing — and adapting ourselves to — the cosmic order rises
to the emotion of love toward the God who is the order and life of the
whole. Then “love toward a being eternal and infinite fills the mind
completely with joy .” 160 This contemplation of the world as a
necessary result of its own nature — of the nature of God — is the
ultimate source of content in the mind of the sage; it brings him the
peace of understanding, of limitations recognized, of truth accepted and
loved. “The highest good ( summum bonum) of the mind is the knowledge of
God, and the highest virtue of the mind is to know God .” 161</p>
<p>650</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Thus Spinoza mated the mathematician and the mystic in his soul. He
still refused to see in his God a spirit capable of returning man’s
love, or of rewarding litanies with miracles; but he applied to his
deity the tender terms that for thousands of years had inspired and
comforted the simplest devotees and the profoundest mystics of Buddhism,
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Cold in the solitude of his
philosophic empyrean, longing to find something in the universe to
receive his adoration and his confidence, the gentle heretic who had
viewed the cosmos as a geometrical diagram ended by seeing and losing
all things in God, by becoming, to the confusion of posterity, the God-
intoxicated “atheist.” The compulsion to find meaning in the universe
made the exile from every faith conclude his seeking with the vision of
an omnipresent divinity, and an exalting sense that, if only for a
moment, he had touched eternity.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE STATE</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps, when Spinoza had finished the Ethics, he felt that, like
most Christian saints, he had formulated a philosophy for the use and
salvation of the individual rather than for the guidance of citizens in
a state. So, tow ard 1675, he set himself to consider man as a
“political animal,” and to apply reason to the problems of society. He
began his fragmentary Tracta- tus politicus with the same resolve that
he had made in analyzing the pas- sions — to be as objective as a
geometer or a physicist:</p>
<p>That I might investigate the subject matter of this science with
the</p>
<p>same freedom of spirit as we generally use in mathematics, I have</p>
<p>labored carefully not to mock, lament, or execrate human actions, but
to understand them; and to this end I have looked upon passions, such as
love, hatred, anger, envy, ambition, pity, and the other perturba- tions
of the mind, not in the light of vices of human nature, but as</p>
<p>properties just as pertinent to it as are heat, cold, storm, thunder,
and the like to the nature of the atmosphere. 162</p>
<p>Since human nature is the material of politics, Spinoza felt that a
study of the state should begin by considering the basic character of
man. We might understand this better if we could imagine man before
social organ- ization modified his conduct by force, morality, and law;
and if we would remember that underneath his general and reluctant
submission to these socializing influences he is still agitated by the
lawless impulses that in the “state of nature” were restrained only by
fear of hostile power. Spinoza follows Hobbes and many others in
supposing that man once existed in such a condition, and his picture of
this hypothetical savage is almost as</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>651</p>
<p>dark as in The Leviathan. In that Garden of Evil the might of the
individual was the only right; nothing was a crime, because there was no
law; and nothing was just or unjust, right or wrong, because there was
no moral code. Consequently “the law and ordinance of nature . . .
forbids nothing . . . and is not opposed to strife, hatred, anger,
treachery, or in general any- thing that appetite suggests .” 163 By
“natural right,” then — i.e., by the opera- tio ns of “nature” as
distinct from the rules and laws of society — every man is entided to
whatever he is strong enough to get and to hold; and this is still
assumed between species and between states ; 164 hence man has a “nat -
ural right” to use animals for his service or his food . 165</p>
<p>Spinoza moderates this savage picture by suggesting that man, even in
his first appearance on the earth, may have been already living in
social groups. “Since fear of solitude exists in all m en — because no
one in solitude is strong enough to defend himself and procure the
necessaries of life — it follows that men by nature tend towards social
organization .” 166 Men, then, have social as well as individualistic
instincts, and society and the state have some roots in the nature of
man. However and whenever it came about, men and families united in
groups, and the “natural right” or might of the individual was now
limited by the right or might of the community. Doubt- less men accepted
these restrictions reluctantly, but they accepted them when they learned
that social organization was their most powerful tool for individual
survival and development. So the definition of virtue as any quality
that makes for survival — as “the endeavor to preserve oneself” 167 —
has to be enlarged to include any quality that makes for the survival of
the group. Social organization, the state despite its restraints,
civilization de- spite its artifices — these are the greatest inventions
that man has made for his preservation and development.</p>
<p>Therefore Spinoza anticipates Voltaire’s answer to Rousseau:</p>
<p>Let satirists laugh to their hearts’ content at human affairs,
let</p>
<p>theologians revile them, let the melancholy praise as much as
they</p>
<p>can the rude and barbarous isolated life, let them despise men
and</p>
<p>admire the brutes; despite all this, men will find that they can
prepare with mutual aid far more easily what they need. … A man who
is</p>
<p>guided by reason is freer in a state where he lives according to com-
mon law than in solitude where he is subject to no law . 168</p>
<p>And Spinoza rejects also the other end of the law-less dream — the
utopia of the philosophical anarchist:</p>
<p>Reason, can, indeed, do much to restrain and moderate the passions,
but we saw . . . that the road which reason herself points out is very
steep; so that such as persuade themselves that the multitude . . .
can</p>
<p>6 5 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>ever be induced to live according to the bare dictates of reason must
be dreaming of the poetic golden age, or of some stage play . 189</p>
<p>The purpose and function of the state should be to enable its members
to live the life of reason.</p>
<p>The last end of the state is not to dominate men, nor to restrain</p>
<p>them by fear; rather it is to set free each man from fear, that he
may live and act with full security and without injury to himself or
his</p>
<p>neighbor. The end of the state … is not to make rational beings into
brute beasts and machines 〔as in war〕 ; it is to enable their bodies
and their minds to function safely. It is to lead men to live by, and
to</p>
<p>exercise, a true reason. . . . The end of the state is really liberty
. 170</p>
<p>Consequently Spinoza renews his plea for freedom of speech, or at
least of thought. But yielding, like Hobbes, to fear of theological
fanaticism and strife, he proposes not merely to subject the church to
state control, but to have the state determine what religious doctrines
shall be taught to the people. Quandoque dorrmtat Homerus.</p>
<p>He proceeds to discuss the traditional forms of government. As became
a Dutch patriot resenting the invasion of Holland by Louis XIV, he had
no admiration for monarchy, and he sharply counters Hobbes’s
absolutism:</p>
<p>Experience is supposed to teach that it makes for peace and concord
when all authority is conferred upon one man. For no political order has
stood so long without notable change as that of the Turks, while none
have been so short-lived, nay, so vexed by seditions, as popular or
democratic states. But if slavery, barbarism, and desolation are to be
called peace, then peace is the worst misfortune that can befall a
state. . . . Slavery, not peace, comes from the giving of all power
to</p>
<p>one man. For peace consists not in the absence of war, but in a union
and harmony of men’s souls . 171</p>
<p>Aristocracy, as “government by the best,” would be fine if the best
were</p>
<p>And so Spinoza, in his dying days, began to outline his hopes for
democ- racy. He who had loved the mob-murdered de Witt had no delusions
about the multitude. “Those who have had experience of how changeful
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>&lt;553</p>
<p>rupted by avarice and luxury .” 173 Yet “I believe democracy to be of
all forms of government the most natural, and the most consonant with
indi- vidual liberty. In it no one transfers his natural right so
absolutely that he has no further voice in affairs; he only hands it
over to the majority .” 174 Spinoza proposed to admit to the suffrage
all males except minors, criminals, and slaves. He excluded women
because he judged them by their nature and their burdens to be less fit
than men for deliberation and government . 175 He thought that ruling
officials would be encouraged to good behavior and peaceful policies if
“the militia should be composed of the citizens only, and none of them
be exempted; for an armed man is more independent than a man unarmed .”
176 The care of the poor, he felt, was an obligation incum - bent on the
society as a whole . 177 And there should be but a single tax: The
fields, and the whole soil, and, if it can be managed, the houses,
should be public property, that is, the property of him who holds the
right of the commonwealth; and let him lease them at a yearly rent to
the citizens. . . . With this exception, let them all be free and exempt
from every kind of taxation in time of peace . 178</p>
<p>Then, just as he was entering upon the most precious part of his
treatise, death took the pen from his hand.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE CHAIN OF INFLUENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>In the great chain of ideas that binds the history of philosophy into
one noble groping of baffled human thought, we can see Spinoza’s system
form - ing in twenty centuries behind him, and sharing in shaping the
modern world. First, of course, he was a Jew. Excommunicated though he
was, he could not shed that intensive heritage, nor forget his years of
poring over the Old Testament and the Talmud and the Jewish
philosophers. Recall again the heresies that must have startled his
attention in Ibn Ezra, Maimon- ides, Hasdai Crescas, Levi ben Gerson,
and Uriel Acosta. His training in the Talmud must have helped to sharpen
that logical sense which made the Ethics a classic temple of reason.
“Some begin” their philosophy “from created things,” he said, “and some
from the human mind. I begin from God .” 179 That was the Jewish
way.</p>
<p>From the philosophers traditionally most admired he took little —
though in his distinction between the world of passing things and the
divine world of eternal laws we may find another form of Plato’s
division between indi - vidual entities and their archetypes in the mind
of God. Spinoza’s analysis of the virtues has been traced to Aristotle’s
Nicomachean Ethics . 180 But</p>
<p>654</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>“the authority of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates,” he told a friend,
“has not much weight with me .” 181 Like Bacon and Hobbes, he preferred
Democri - tus, Epicurus, and Lucretius. His ethical ideal may echo the
Stoics; we hear in it some tones of Marcus Aurelius; but it was fully
consistent with Epi- curus.</p>
<p>He owed more to the Scholastic philosophers than he realized, for
they came to him through the medium of Descartes. They too, like Thomas
Aquinas in the great Surnma, had attempted a geometrical exposition of
philosophy. They gave him such terms as substantia, natura naturans, at-
tributum, essentia, summum bonum, and many more. Their identification of
existence and essence in God became his identification of existence and
essence in substance. He extended to man their merger of intellect and
will in God.</p>
<p>Perhaps (as Bayle thought) Spinoza read Bruno. He accepted Giordano’s
distinction between natura naturans and natura naturata; he may have
taken term and idea from Bruno’s conato de conservarsi ; 182 he may have
found in the Italian the unity of body and mind, of matter and spirit,
of world and God, and the conception of the highest knowledge as that
which sees all things in God — though the German mystics must have
spread that view even into commercial Amsterdam.</p>
<p>More immediately, Descartes inspired him with philosophical ideals,
and repelled him with theological platitudes. He was inspired by
Descartes’ ambition to make philosophy march with Euclid in form and
clarity. He probably followed Descartes in drawing up rules to guide his
life and work. He adopted too readily Descartes’ notion that an idea
must be true if it is “clear and distinct.” He accepted and
universalized the Cartesian view of the world as a mechanism of cause
and effect reaching from some primeval vortex right up to the pineal
gland. He acknowledged his indebtedness to Descartes’ analysis of the
passions . 183</p>
<p>The Leviathan of Hobbes, in Latin translation, obviously evoked much
welcome in Spinoza’s thought. Here the conception of mechanism was
worked out without mercy or fear. The mind, which in Descartes was dis-
tinct from the body and was endowed with freedom and immortality, be-
came, in Hobbes and Spinoza, subject to universal law, and capable of
only an impersonal immortality or none at all. Spinoza found in The
Leviathan an acceptable analysis of sensation, perception, memory, and
idea, and an unsentimental analysis of human nature. From the common
starting point of a “state of nature” and a “social compact” the two
thinkers came to contrary conclusions: Hobbes, from his royalist
circles, to monarchy; Spinoza, from his Dutch patriotism, to democracy.
Perhaps it was through Hobbes that the gentle Jew was led to MachiavelH;
he refers to him as “that most acute Florentine,” and again as “that
most ingenious . . . , foreseeing</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>SPINOZA</p>
<p>655</p>
<p>man.” 184 But he escaped the confusion of right with might, rec
ognizing that this is forgivable only among individuals in the “state of
nature,” and among states before the establishment of effective
international law.</p>
<p>All these influences were tempered and molded by Spinoza into a
struc- ture of thought awe-inspiring in its apparent logic, harmony, and
unity. There were cracks in the temple, as friends and enemies pointed
out: Old- enburg ably criticized the opening axioms and propositions of
the Ethics , 185 and Uberweg subjected them to a Germanically meticulous
analysis. 186 The logic was brilliant, but perilously deductive; though
based upon per- sonal experience, it was an artistry of thought resting
upon internal con- sistency rather than objective fac t. Spinoza’s trust
in his reasoning (though what other guide could he have?) was his sole
immodesty. He expressed his confidence that man can understand God, or
essential reality and univer- sal law; he repeatedly avowed his
conviction that he had proved his doc- trines beyond all question or
obscurity; and sometimes he spoke with an assurance unbecoming in a
spray of foam analyzing the sea. What if all logic is an intellectual
convenience, a heuristic tool of the seeking mind, rather than the
structure of the world? So the inescapable logic of determin- ism
reduces consciousness (as Huxley confessed) to an epiphenomenon — an
apparently superfluous appendage of psychophysical processes which, by
the mechanics of cause and effect, would go on just as well without it;
and yet nothing seems more real, nothing more impressive, than
conscious- ness. After logic has had its say, the mystery, tam grande
secretum, remains.</p>
<p>These difficulties may have shared in the unpopularity of
Spinoza’s</p>
<p>philosophy in the first century after his death; but resentment was
more violently directed against his critique of the Bible, prophecies,
and miracles, and his conception of God as lovable but impersonal and
deaf. The Jews thought of their son as a traitor to his people; the
Christians cursed him as a very Satan among philosophers, an Antichrist
who sought to rob the world of all meaning, mercy, and hope. Even the
heretics condemned him. Bayle was repelled by Spinoza’s view that all
things and all men are modes of the one and only substance, cause, or
God; then, said Bayle, God is the real agent of all actions, the real
cause of all evil, all crimes and wars; and when a Turk slays a
Hungarian it is God slaying Himself; this, Bayle pro- tested (forgetting
the subjectivity of evil) was a “most absurd and mon - strous
hypothesis.” 187 Leibniz was for a decade (1676 -86) strongly influenced
by Spinoza. The doctrine of monads as centers of psychic force may owe
something to omnia quodammodo anrmata. At one time Leibniz declared that
only one feature of Spinoza’s philosophy offended him — the rejection of
final causes, or providential design, in the cosmic process. 188 When
the outcry against Spinoza’s “atheism” became universal, Leibniz joined
in it as part of his own conatus sese preservandi.</p>
<p>6;6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Spinoza had a modest, almost a concealed, share in generating the
French Enlightenment. The leaders of that combustion used Spinoza’s
Biblical criticism as a weapon in their war against the Church, and they
admired his determinism, his naturalistic ethic, his rejection of design
in nature. But they were baffled by the religious terminology and
apparent mysticism of the Ethics. We can imagine the reaction of
Voltaire or Diderot, of Hel- vetius or d’Holbach, to such statements as
“The mental intellectual love towards God is the very love of God with
which God loves himself.” 189</p>
<p>The German spirit was more responsive to this side of Spinoza’s
thought. According to a conversation (1780) reported by Friedrich
Jacobi, Lessing not only confessed that he had been a Spinozist through
all his mature life, but affirmed that “there is no other philosophy
than Spinoza’s.” 190 It was precisely the pantheistic identification of
nature and God that thrilled the Germany of the romantic movement after
the Aufkldrung under Frederick the Great had run its course. Jacobi,
champion of the new Gefiihlsphiloso- phie, was among the first defenders
of Spinoza (1785); it was another German romantic, Novalis, who called
Spinoza “ der Gottbetrunkene</p>
<p>England for a century knew Spinoza chiefly through hearsay, and de-
nounced him as a distant and terrible ogre. Stillingfleet (1677)
referred to him vaguely as “a late author 〔who〕 I hear is mightily in
vogue among many who cry up anything on the atheistical side.” A
Scottish professor, George Sinclair (1685), wrote of “a monstrous rabble
of men who, follow - ing the Hobbesian and Spinosian principle, slight
religion and undervalue the Scripture.” Sir John Evelyn ( 1690?) spoke
of the Tractatus theo-</p>
<p>logico- politicus as “that infamous book,” a “wretched obstacle to
the searchers of holy truth.” Berkeley (1732), while ranking Spinoza
among “weak and wicked writers,” thought him “the great leader of our
modern infi dels.” 192 As late as 1739 the agnostic Hume shuddered
cautiously at the “hideous hypothesis” of “that famous atheist,” the
“universally infamous Spinoza.” 193 Not till the romantic movement at
the turn of the eighteenth</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) SPINOZA 657</p>
<p>into the nineteenth century did Spinoza really reach the English
mind. Then he, more than any other philosopher, inspired the youthful
meta- physics of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley and Byron. Shelley
quoted the Tractatus theologico-politicus in the original notes to Queen
Mab, and began a translation of it, for which Byron pledged a preface; a
fragment of this version came into the hands of an English critic, who,
taking it for a work by Shelley himself, called it a “schoolboy
speculation . . . too cru de for publication entire.” George Eliot
translated the Ethics with virile</p>
<p>resolution, and James Froude 194 and Matthew Arnold 195 acknowledged
the influence of Spinoza on their mental development. Of all the
intellectual products of man, religion and philosophy seem to endure the
longest. Pericles is famous because he lived in the days of
Socrates.</p>
<p>We love Spinoza especially among the philosophers because he was also
a saint, because he lived, as well as wrote, philosophy. The virtues
praised by the great religions were honored and embodied in the outcast
who could find a home in none of the religions, since none would let him
conceive God in terms that science could accept. Looking back upon that
dedicated life and concentrated thought, we feel in them an element of
nobility that encourages us to think well of mankind. Let us admit half
of the terrible picture that Swift drew of humanity; let us agree that
in every generation of man’s history, and almost everywhere, we find
superstition, hypocrisy, cor- ruption, cruelty, crime, and war: in the
balance against them we place the long roster of poets, composers,
artists, scientists, philosophers, and saints. That same species upon
which poor Swift revenged the frustrations of his flesh wrote the plays
of Shakespeare, the music of Bach and Handel, the odes of Keats, the
Republic of Plato, the Principia of Newton, and the Ethics of Spinoza;
it built the Parthenon and painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; it
conceived and cherished, even if it crucified, Christ. Man did all this;
let him never despair.</p>
