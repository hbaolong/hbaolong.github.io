<h4 id="chapter-xi-spain-and-the-enlightenment">CHAPTER XI Spain and the
Enlightenment</h4>
<p>I7OO-88</p>
<p>I. MILIEU</p>
<p>AT his death in 1700 Charles II, last of the Spanish Hapsburgs,
bequeathed Spain and all its global empire to the age-long enemy of the
Hapsburgs — Bourbon France. The grandson of Louis XIV, as Philip V of
Spain, fought bravely during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-13)
to maintain that empire unimpaired; nearly all Europe rose in arms to
prevent so danger- ous an aggrandizement of Bourbon power; in the end
Spain had to yield Gibraltar and Minorca to England, Sicily to Savoy,
and Naples, Sardinia, and “Belgium” to Austria.</p>
<p>Moreover, the loss of sea power left Spain only a precarious hold on
the colonies that nourished her commerce and her wealth. Wheat in
Spanish America gave from five to twenty times the yield per acre that
came from the soil of Spain. From those sunny lands came mercury,
copper, zinc, ar- senic, dyes, meat, hides, rubber, cochineal, sugar,
cocoa, coffee, tobacco, tea, quinine and a dozen other medicaments. In
1788 Spain exported to her Amer- ican colonies goods valued at
158,000,000 reales; she imported from them goods valued at 804,000,000
reales; this “unfavorable balance of trade” was wiped out by a stream of
American silver and gold. The Philippines sent cargoes of pepper,
cotton, indigo, and sugar cane. At the end of the eight- eenth century
Alexander von Humboldt estimated the population of the Philippines at
1,900,000, of Spanish America at 16,902,000; Spain herself, in 1797, had
1 0,54 1, 000. 1 It is one credit to Bourbon rule that this last figure
almost doubled the population of 5,700,000 in 1700.</p>
<p>Geography favored Spain only for maritime commerce. In the north the
land was fertile, fed with rains and the melting snows of the Pyrenees;
irriga- tion canals (mostly bequeathed to their conquerors by the Moors)
had re- claimed Valencia, Murcia, and Andalusia from aridity; the rest
of Spain was discouragingly mountainous or dry. The gifts of nature were
not developed by economic enterprise; the most venturesome Spaniards
went to the colo- nies; Spain preferred to buy industrial products from
abroad with her co- lonial gold and the yield of her own mines of
silver, copper, iron, or lead; her industries, still in the guild or
domestic stage, lagged far behind those of the industrious North; and
many of her rich mines were operated by foreign management for the
profit of German or English investors. The production of wool was
monopolized by the Mesta, an association of flock owners privi- leged by
the government, entrenched in tradition, and dominated by a small</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>2 74</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>minority of nobles and monasteries. Competition was stifled,
improvements lagged. A meager proletariat festered in the towns, serving
as domestics to the great or as journeymen in the guilds. Some Negro or
Moorish slaves adorned affluent homes. A small middle class lived in
dependence upon the government, the nobility, or the Church.</p>
<p>Of the agricultural land 51.5 per cent was owned in vast tracts by
noble families, 16.5 per cent by the Church, 32 per cent by communes
(towns) or peasants. The growth of peasant proprietorship was retarded
by an old law of entail, which required that an estate should be
bequeathed intact to the eldest son, and that no part of it should be
mortgaged or sold. Through most of the century, except in the Basque
provinces, three quarters of the soil was tilled by tenants paying
tribute in rent, fees, service, or kind to aristocratic or
ecclesiastical landlords whom they rarely saw. As rents were raised ac-
cording to the productivity of the farm, the tenants had no incentive to
inventiveness or industry. 2 The owners defended the practice by
alleging that the progressive depreciation of the currency forced them
to raise rents to keep pace with rising prices and costs. Meanwhile a
sales tax on such neces- saries as meat, wine, olive oil, candles, and
soap fell heavily upon the poor (who spent most of their income on
necessaries), more lightly upon the rich. The result of these
procedures, of hereditary privilege, and of the natural inequality of
human ability, was a concentration of wealth at the top, and at the
bottom a somber poverty that continued from generation to genera- tion,
alleviated and abetted by supernatural consolations.</p>
<p>The nobility was jealously divided into grades of dignity. At the top
(in</p>
<ol start="1787" type="1">
<li>were 1 19 grandees — grande s de E spail a. We may guess at their
wealth from the probably exaggerated report of the contemporary British
traveler Joseph Towmsend that “three great lords— the dukes of Osuna,
Alba, and Medinaceli — cover [own] almost the whole province of
Andalusia.” 3 Medi - naceli received one million reales yearly from his
fisheries alone; Osuna had an annual income of 8,400,000 reales; the
Count of Aranda had nearly 1,600,000 reales a year. 4 Below the grandees
were 535 titulos — men who had been given hereditary titles by the king
on condition of remitting half their income to the Crown. Below these
were the Caballeros — chevaliers or knights named by the king to
lucrative membership in one of the four military orders of Spain:
Santiago, Alcantara, Calatrava, and Montesa. The lowliest of the nobles
were the 400,000 hidalgos, who owned modest tracts of land, were exempt
from military service and from imprisonment for debt, and had the right
to display a coat of arms and be addressed as Don. Some of them were
poor, some joined the beggars in the streets. Most of the nobles lived
in the cities, and named the municipal officials.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the divine guardian of the status quo the Spanish Church claimed a
comfortable share of the gross national product. A Spanish authority
reck- oned its annual income, after taxes, at 1,101,753,000 reales, and
that of the state at 1,371, 000, ooo. 5 A third of its revenues came
from land; large sums from tithes and first fruits; petty cash from
christenings, marriages, funerals, Masses for the dead, and monastic
costumes sold to pious people who thought</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 275</p>
<p>hat if they died in such robes they might slip unquestioned into
Paradise. Monastic mendicants brought in an additional 53,000,000
reales. The aver- age priest, of course, was poor, partly because of his
number; Spain had 91,258 men in orders, of whom 16,481 were priests and
2,943 were Jesuits. 6 In 1797 sixty thousand monks and thirty thousand
nuns lived in three thou- sand monasteries or convents. The Archbishop
of Seville and his staff of 235 aides enjoyed an annual revenue of six
million reales; the Archbishop of Toledo, with six hundred aides,
received nine million. Here, as in Italy and Austria, ecclesiastical
wealth aroused no protest from the people; the cathe- dral was their
creation, and they loved to see it gorgeously adorned.</p>
<p>Their piety set a standard for Christendom. Nowhere else in the
eighteenth century was the Catholic theology so thoroughly believed, or
the Catholic ritual so fervently observed. Religious practices rivaled
the pursuit of bread, and probably exceeded the pursuit of sex, as part
of the substance of life. The people, including the prostitutes, crossed
themselves a dozen times a day. The worship of the Virgin far surpassed
the adoration of Christ; images of her were everywhere; women lovingly
sewed robes for her statues, and crowned her head with fresh flowers; in
Spain above all rose the popular demand that her “immaculate
conception”— her freedom from the stain of original sin — be made a part
of the defined and required faith. The men al- most equaled the women in
piety. Many men, as well as women, heard Mass daily. In some religious
processions (until it was forbidden in 1777) men of the lower classes
flogged themselves with knotted cords ending in balls of wax containing
broken glass; they professed to be doing this to prove their devotion to
God or Mary or a woman; some thought such bloodletting was good for the
health 7 and kept Eros down.</p>
<p>Religious processions were frequent, dramatic, and colorful; one
humorist complained that he could not take a step in Madrid without
coming upon such a solemnity; and not to kneel when it passed was to
risk arrest or in- jury. When the people of Saragossa rose in revolt in
1766, sacking and loot- ing, and a religious procession appeared with a
bishop holding the Sacrament before him, the rioters bared their heads
and knelt in the streets; when the retinue had filed by they resumed the
sack of the town. 8 In the great Corpus Christi procession all the
departments of the government took part, some- times led by the king.
Throughout Holy Week the cities of Spain were draped in black, theaters
and cafes were closed, churches were crowded, and supplementary altars
were set up in public squares to accommodate the overflow of piety. In
Spain Christ was king, Mary was queen, and the sense of divine presence
was, in every waking hour, part of the essence of life. Two religious
orders especially prospered in Spain. The Jesuits, through their
learning and address, dominated education and became confessors to
royalty. The Dominicans controlled the Inquisition, and though this
institu- tion had long since passed its heydav it was still strong
enough to terrify the people and challenge the state. When some remnants
of Judaism appeared under Bourbon laxity the Inquisition snuffed them
out with autos-da-fe. In seven years (1720-27) the Inquisitors condemned
868 persons, of whom 820</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>were accused of secret Judaism; seventy-five were burned, others were
sent to the galleys, or merely scourged. 9 In 1722 Philip V testified
his adoption of Spanish ways by presiding over a sumptuous auto-da-fe in
which nine heretics were burned in celebration of the coming of a French
princess to Madrid. 10 His successor, Ferdinand VI, showed a milder
spirit; during his reign (1746- 59) “only” ten persons— all “relapsed”
Jews— were burned alive. 11</p>
<p>The Inquisition exercised a strangling censorship over all
publication. A Dominican monk reckoned that there was less printing in
Spain in the eight- eenth century than in the sixteenth. 12 Most books
were religious, and the people liked them so. The lower classes were
illiterate, and felt no need for reading or writing. Schools were in the
hands of the clergy, but thousands of parishes had no schools at all.
The once great Spanish universities had fallen far behind those of
Italy, France, England, or Germany in everything but orthodox theology.
Medical schools were poor, ill-staffed, ill-equipped; ther- apy relied
upon bloodletting, purging, relics, and prayer; Spanish physicians were
a peril to human life. Science was medieval, history was legend, super-
stition flourished, portents and miracles abounded. The belief in
witchcraft survived to the end of the century, and appeared among the
horrors that Goya drew.</p>
<p>Such was the Spain that the Bourbons came from France to rule.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Philip v: 1700-46</li>
</ol>
<p>Felipe Quinto was a good man within his lights, which had been
limited by his education. As a younger son to the Dauphin he had been
trained to modesty, piety, and obedience, and he never overcame these
virtues suffi- ciently to meet half a century of challenges in
government and war. His piety led him to accept in Spain a religious
obscurantism that was dying in France; his docility made him malleable
by his ministers and his wives.</p>
<p>Maria Luisa Gabriela, daughter of Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, was
only thirteen when she married Philip (1701), but she was already adept
in femi- nine wiles; her beauty and vivacity, her tantrums and tears
reduced the King to an exhausted subjection, while she and her chief
lady in waiting manipu- lated the politics of their adopted land. Marie
Anne de La Tremoille, Prin- cesse des Ursins, French widow of a Spanish
grandee, had helped the girl Queen to marriage and power. Ambitious but
tactful, she became for a decade a power behind the throne. She could
not rely upon beauty, for she was fifty-nine in 1701, but she provided
the knowledge and subtlety lacking in the Queen, and after 1705 she
determined policy. In 1714 Maria Luisa, aged twenty-six, died, and
Philip, who had learned to love her devotedly, sank into a morbid
melancholy. Mme. des Ursins thought to salvage her power by arranging
his marriage with Isabella (Elizabeth) Farnese, daughter of Duke Odoardo
II of Parma and Piacenza. She went to meet the new Queen at the Spanish
border, but Isabella curtly ordered her to leave Spain. She withdrew to
Rome and died eight years later in wealth and oblivion.</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 277</p>
<p>Isabella did not admit that the Renaissance was over; she had all the
force of will, keenness of intellect, fire of temper, and scorn of
scruples that had marked the women, as well as the men, who had
dominated sixteenth- century Italy. She found in Philip a man who could
not make up his mind, and who could not sleep alone; their bed became
her throne, from which she ruled a nation, directed armies, and won
Italian principalities. She had known almost nothing of Spain, nor did
she ever take to the Spanish character, but she studied that character,
she made herself familiar with the needs of the country, and the King
was surprised to find her as informed and resourceful as his
ministers.</p>
<p>In his first years of rule Philip had used Jean Orry and other French
aides to reorganize the government on lines set by Louis XIV:
centralized and audited administration and finance, with a trained
bureaucracy and provin- cial intendants, all under the legislative,
judicial, and executive authority of the royal council, here called the
Consejo de Castilla. Corruption diminished, extravagance was checked —
except in the building operations of the King. To these French ministers
there succeeded in 1714 an able and ambitious Italian, the Abate Giulio
Alberoni, whose energy made the Spanish shudder. Son of a Piacenza
gardener, he had reached Spain as secretary to the Due de Ven- dome. He
had been the first to suggest Isabella Farnese as Philip’s second wife;
grateful, she eased his way to power. Together they kept the King away
from affairs, and from any counsel but their own. Together they planned
to build up Spain’s armed forces, and use them to drive the Austrians
out of Italy, restore Spanish ascendancy in Naples and Milan, and set up
ducal thrones to be graced, someday, by the farseeing Isabella’s
sons.</p>
<p>Alberoni asked five years for preparation. He replaced titled
sluggards with middle-class ability in the leading posts; he taxed the
clergy and im- prisoned rebellious priests; 13 he scrapped worn-out
vessels and built better ones; he set up forts and arsenals along coasts
and frontiers; he subsidized industry, opened up roads, accelerated
communication, abolished sales taxes and traffic tolls. The British
ambassador in Madrid warned his government that with a few more years of
such advances Spain would be a danger to other European powers. 14 To
soothe such fears Alberoni pretended that he was raising forces to help
Venice and the papacy against the Turks. Indeed, he sent six galleys to
Clement XI, who rewarded him with a red hat (1717). “The Spanish
monarchy,” wrote Voltaire, “has resumed new life under Cardinal
Alberoni.” 15</p>
<p>Everything was granted him but time. He hoped to win French and Eng-
lish consent to Spanish aims in Italy, and offered substantial
concessions in return, but the careless King spoiled these maneuvers by
revealing his desire to replace Philippe d‘Orleans as ruler of France.
Philippe turned against Felipe, and joined England and the United
Provinces in a pact to maintain the territorial arrangements fixed by
the Treaty of Utrecht. Austria violated that treaty by compelling Savoy
to give her Sicily in exchange for Sardinia. Alberoni protested that
this placed athwart the Mediterranean a power whose head still claimed
the crown of Spain. Cursing the undue acceleration of events, he
resigned himself to premature war. His newborn fleet captured</p>
<p>278 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Palermo (1718), and his troops soon brought all Sicily under Spanish
con- trol. Austria thereupon joined England, France, and Holland in a
Quadruple Alliance against Spain. On August 11, 1718, a British squadron
under Ad- miral Byng destroyed the Spanish fleet off the coast of
Sicily; Spain’s best troops were bottled up in that island while French
armies invaded Spain. Philip and Isabella sued for peace; it was granted
on condition of Alberoni’s banishment. He fled to Genoa (1719), made his
way in disguise through Austrian-held Lombardy to Rome, took part in the
conclave that elected Innocent XIII, and died in 1752, aged
eighty-eight. On February 17, 1720, a Spanish envoy signed in London a
treaty by which Philip resigned all claim to the throne of France, Spain
surrendered Sicily to Austria, England prom- ised to restor e Gibraltar
to Spain, and the Allies pledged to Isabella’s off - spring the right of
succession to Parma and Tuscany.</p>
<p>In the kaleidoscope of international politics allies soon become
enemies, and foes may formally become friends. To cement peace with
France, Philip had betrothed his two-year-old daughter, Maria Ana
Victoria, to Louis XV in 1721, and had sent her — all wondering — to
France (1722). But in 1725 France sent her back so that Louis might
marry a woman who could at once undertake the task of giving him an
heir. Insulted, Spain allied herself with Austria; the Emperor Charles
VI promised to help recapture Gibraltar; when a Spanish army tried to
take that bastion Austrian help did not come; the attempt failed, and
Spain not only made peace with England, but restored to her the Asiento
monopoly of selling slaves to Spanish colonies; in return Britain
pledged to put Isabella’s son Don Carlos on the ducal throne of Parma.
In 1731 Carlos and six thousand Spanish troops were escorted to Italy by
an English fleet. Austria, to secure British and Spanish support for the
accession of Maria Theresa to the Imperial throne, yielded Parma and
Piacenza to Carlos. In 1734 Carlos promoted himself to Naples.
Isabella’s triumph was complete.</p>
<p>Philip, however, sank into a melancholy mood that, after 1736, lapsed
now and then into insanity. He shrank into a corner of his room,
thinking that all who entered planned to kill him. He was loath to eat
for fear of being poisoned. For a long time he refused to leave his bed
or be shaved. Isabella tried a hundred ways to heal or soothe him; all
failed but one. In 1737 she coaxed Farinelli to come to Spain. One
night, in an apartment adjoining the King’s, she arranged a concert in
which the great castrat o sang two arias by Hasse. Philip rose from his
bed to look through a doorway and see what agency could make such
captivating sounds. Isabella brought Farinelli to him; the monarch
praised and caressed him, and bade him name his reward; nothing would be
refused. Previously instructed by the Queen, the singer asked only that
Philip should let himself be shaved and dressed, and should appear at
the royal council. The King consented; his fears subsided; he seemed
miraculously healed. But when the next evening came he called for
Farinelli, and begged him to sing those same two songs again; only so
could he be calmed to sleep. So it continued, night after night, for ten
years. Farinelli was paid 200,000 reales a year, but was not allowed to
sing except at</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 279</p>
<p>he court. He accepted the condition gracefully, and though his power
over the King was greater than that of any minister, he never abused it,
always used it for good; he remained untouched by venality, and won the
admiration of all. 16</p>
<p>In 1746 Philip ordered 100,000 Masses to be said for his salvation;
if so many should not be needed to get him into heaven the surplus
should be applied to poor souls for whom no such provision had been
made. 17 In that year he died.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>FERDINAND VI: 1 746-59</li>
</ol>
<p>His second son by his first wife succeeded him, and gave Spain
thirteen years of healing rule. Isabella survived till 1766; she was
treated with kind- ness and courtesy by her stepson, but she lost her
power to influence events. Ferdinand’s wife, Maria Barbara, Scarlatti’s
pupil, was now the woman be - hind the throne; though she loved food and
money beyond reason, she was a gentler spirit than Isabella, and gave
most of her energies to encouraging music and art. Farinelli continued
to sing for the new rulers, and Scarlatti’s</p>
<p>Ferdinand was a man of good will, kindly and honest, but he had
inherited a delicate constitution and was subject to fits of passion, of
which he was painfully ashamed. 18 Conscious of his limitations, he left
administration to two able ministers — Don Jose de Carvajal and Zenon de
Somodevilla, Marques de la Ensenada. Ensenada improved agricultural
methods, subsidized mining and industry, built roads and canals,
abolished internal tolls, rebuilt the navy, replaced the hated sales tax
by a tax on income and property, reorganized the finances, and broke
down the intellectual isolation of Spain by sending stu- dents abroad.
Partly through Ensenada’s diplomacy a concordat was signed with the
papacy (1753), reserving to the King the right to tax ecclesiastical
property and to appoint bishops to Spanish sees. The power of the Church
was reduced, the Inquisition was subdued, public autos-da-fe were
abolished.</p>
<p>The two ministers diverged in foreign policy. Carvajal felt the charm
of the devoted British ambassador, Sir Benjamin Keene, and took a
peaceful pro-British line; Ensenada favored France, and moved toward war
with England. Ferdinand, appreciating his energy and ability, was long
patient with him, but finally dismissed him. While nearly all Europe
fell into seven years of war, Ferdinand gave his people a longer period
of tranquillity and prosperity than Spain had enjoyed since Philip
II.</p>
<p>In 1758 Maria Barbara died. The King, who had loved her as if
politics had had nothing to do with their marriage, fell into a state of
melancholy and unshaved dishevelment strangely recalling that of his
father; in his final</p>

<p>year he too was insane. Toward the end he refused to go to bed,
fearing that he would never get up again. He died in his chair, August
io, 1759. Every- one mourned the royal lovers, for their rule had been a
rare blessing to Spain.</p>

<li>THE ENLIGHTENMENT ENTERS SPAIN</li>
</ol>
<p>The story of the Enlightenment in Spain is a case of a resistible
force en- countering an immovable body. The Spanish character, and its
blood-written pledge to its medieval faith, turned back sooner or later
all winds of heresy or doubt, all alien forms of dress or manners or
economy. Only one eco- nomic force favored foreign thought — Spanish
merchants who daily dealt with strangers, and who knew to what power and
wealth their like had risen in England and France. They were willing to
import ideas if these could weaken the hold that nobles and clergy had
inherited on the land, life, and mind of Spain. They knew that religion
had lost its power in England; some had heard of Newton and Locke; even
Gibbon was to find a few readers in Spain. 19</p>
<p>Of course the strongest Enlightenment breezes came from France. The
French aristocrats who followed Philip V to Madrid were already touched
by the irreligion that hid its head under Louis XIV but ran rampant
during the Regency. In 1714 some scholars founded the Real Academia
Espanola in emulation of the French Academy; soon it began work on a
dictionary; in 1737 the Diario de los liter atos de Espana undertook to
rival the Journal des savants. The Duke of Alba, who directed the Real
Academia for twenty years (1756-76), was a warm admirer of Jean-Jacques
Rousseau. 20 In 1773 he subscribed eight louis d’or for Pigalle’s statue
of Voltaire; “Condemned</p>
<p>Gratuitous advertisement was given to Rousseau’s Emile by its
ceremoni - ous burning in a Madrid church (1765). 22 Young Spaniards
acquainted with Paris, like the Marques de Mora who loved Julie de
Lespinasse, came back to Spain with some rubbing of the skepticism that
they had encountered in the salons. Copies of works by Voltaire,
Diderot, or Raynal were smuggled into Spain, and aroused some innovating
minds. A Spanish journalist wrote in 1763: “Through the effect of many
pernicious books that have become the fashion, such as those of
Voltaire, Rousseau, and Helvetius, much cooling of faith has been felt
in this countr y.” 23 Pablo Olavide openly expressed Voltairean ideas in
his Madrid salon (c. 17 66). 24 On the shelves of the So- ciedades
Economicas de los Amigos del Pai’s in Madrid were works by Vol- taire,
Rousseau, Bayle, d’Alembert, Montesquieu, Hobbes, Locke, and Hume. 25
Abbe Clement, touring Spain in 1768, reported a wide spread of religious
indifference, even unbelief, covered with external observance of
Catholic ritual. 26 In 1778 the Inquisition was informed that the
highest offi- cials of the court read the French philosophes. 27</p>
<p>It was of considerable importance to Spanish history that Pedro
Abarca,</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p>28 l</p>
<p>Conde de Aranda, traveling in France, became a friend of Voltaire. We
may judge of his connections by his later activity as Spanish ambassador
to Ver- sailles; he mixed freely with the Encyclopedists in Paris,
formed an admiring intimacy with d’Alembert, and crossed France to visit
Voltaire at Ferney. In Spain he professed fidelity to the Church, but it
was he who persuaded Charles III to expel the Jesuits. Under his
guidance Charles joined the ranks of those “enlightened despots” to whom
the philosophes were looking as their likeliest aides in the spread of
education, liberty, and reason.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>Charles in: 1759-88</li>
</ol>
<p>/. The New Government</p>
<p>When he arrived from Naples he was forty-three years old. He was wel-
comed by all but the Jesuits, 28 who resented the sale of their
Paraguayan settlements by Spain to Portugal (1750). Otherwise he won all
hearts by remitting arrears of taxes, and restoring some of the
privileges that the provinces had lost under the centralizing policy of
Philip V. His first year as king of Spain was saddened by the death of
his wife, Maria Amalia. He never married again. It is to the credit of
the Spanish Bourbons of the eighteenth century that they gave the
monarchs of Europe an example of marital devo- tion and stability.</p>
<p>A British diplomat drew a British picture of Charles, who had had
some encounters with the English in Naples:</p>
<p>The King has a very odd appearance in person and dress. He is of
diminu- tive stature, with a complexion the color of mahogany. He has
not been meas- ured for a coat these thirty years, so that it sits on
him like a sack. His waist- coat and breeches are generally leather,
with a pair of cloth spatterdashes on his legs…. He goes out a-sporting
every day of the year, rain or blow. 29</p>
<p>But the Earl of Bristol added, in 1761:</p>
<p>The Catholic King has good talents, a happy memory, and uncommon com-
mand of himself on all occasions. His having been often deceived renders
him suspicious. He ever prefers carrying a point by gentle means, and
has the pa- tience to repeat exhortations rather than exert his
authority… Yet, with</p>
<p>he greatest air of gentleness, he keeps his ministers and attendants
in the utmost awe. 30</p>
<p>His personal piety gave no warning that he would attack the Jesuits
or un dertake religious reforms. He heard Mass daily. His “honest and
obstinate adherence to all his treaties, principles, and engagements”
astonished an Eng - lish enemy. 31 He devoted a large part of each
weekday to governmental affairs. He rose at six, visited his children,
breakfasted, worked from eight to eleven, sat in council, received
dignitaries, dined in public, gave several hours to hunting, supped at
nine-thirty, fed his dogs, said his prayers, and went to bed. His
hunting was probably a health measure, aimed to dispel the melancholy
that ran in the family.</p>
<p>He began with some serious mistakes. Unfamiliar with Spain, which
he</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>had not seen since his sixteenth year, he took as his first aides
two’ Italians who had served him well in Naples: the Marchese de’
Grimaldi in foreign policy, the Marchese de’ Squillaci in domestic
affairs.</p>
<p>The Earl of Bristol described Squillaci as “not bright. He is fond of
busi - ness, and never complains of having too much, notwithstanding the
variety of departments that center in him…. I believe he is incapable of
taking any bribes, but I would not be equally responsible for his wife.”
32 Squillaci did not like the crime, odor, and gloom of Madrid; he
organized a zealous police and a street-cleaning squad, and lighted the
capital with five thousand lamps. He legalized monopolies for supplying
the city with oil, bread, and other necessities; a drought raised
prices, and the populace called for Squil- laci’s head. He offended the
clergy by regulations that checked their privi - leges and power. He
lost a thousand supporters by banning concealed weap- ons. Finally he
stirred up a revolution by attempting to change the dress of the people.
He persuaded the King that the long cape, which hid the figure, and the
broad hat with turned-down rim, which hid much of the face, made it
easier to conceal weapons, and harder for the police to recognize
criminals. A succession of royal decrees forbade the cape and the hat,
and officers were equipped with shears to cut the offending garments
down to legal size. 33 This was more government than the proud
Madrilenos could stand. On Palm Sunday, March 23, 1766, they rose in
revolt, captured ammunition stores, emptied the prisons, overwhelmed
soldiers and police, attacked Squillaci’s home, stoned Grimaldi, killed
the Walloon guards of the royal palace, and pa- raded with the heads of
these hated foreigners held aloft on pikes and crowned with broad-rimmed
hats. For two days the mob slaughtered and pillaged. Charles yielded,
repealed the decrees, and sent Squillaci, safely escorted, back to
Italy. Meanwhile he had discovered the talents of the Conde de Aranda,
and appointed him president of the Council of Castile. Aranda made the
long cape and wide sombrero the official costume of the hangman; the new
connotation made the old garb unfashionable; most Ma- drilenos adopted
French dress.</p>
<p>Aranda came of an old and wealthy family in Aragon. We have seen him
imbibing Enlightenment in France; he went also to Prussia, where he
studied military organization. He returned to Spain eager to bring his
country abreast of those northern states. His Encyclopedist friends
rejoiced too pub- licly over his accession to power; he mourned that
they had thereby made his course more difficult, 34 and he wished they
had studied diplomacy. He defined political diplomacy as the art of</p>
<p>recognizing the strength, resources, interests, rights, fears, and
hopes of the dif- ferent powers, so that, as the occasion warrants it,
we may appease these powers, divide them, defeat them, or ally ourselves
with them, depending on how they serve our advantage and increase our
security. 35</p>
<p>The King was in a mood for ecclesiastical reforms because he
suspected the clergy of secretly encouraging the revolt against
Squillaci. 36 He had per- mitted the government press to print in 1765
an anonymous Tratado de la</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 283</p>
<p>regalia de V amortization, which questioned the right of the Church
to amass real property, and argued that in all temporal matters the
Church should be subject to the state. The author was Conde Pedro
Rodriguez de Campoma- nes, a member of the Consejo de Castilla. In 1761
Charles had issued an order requiring royal consent for the publication
of papal bulls or briefs in Spain; later he rescinded this order; in
1768 he renewed it. Now he supported Aranda and Campomanes in a
succession of religious reforms that for one exciting generation remade
the intellectual face of Spain.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Spanish Reformation</li>
</ol>
<p>The Spanish reformers — perhaps excepting Aranda — had no intent to
de- stroy Catholicism in Spain. The long wars to drive out the Moors
(like the long struggle for the liberation of Ireland) had made
Catholicism a part of patriotism, and had intensified it into a faith
too sanctified by the sacrifices of the nation to admit of successful
challenge or basic change. The hope of the reformers was to bring the
Church under control of the state, and to free the mind of Spain from
terror of the Inquisition. They began by attacking the Jesuits.</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus had been born in Spain in the mind and
experiences of Ignatius Loyola, and some of its greatest leaders had
come from Spain. Here, as in Portugal, France, Italy, and Austria, it
controlled secondary edu- cation, gave confessors to kings and queens,
and shared in forming royal policies. Its expanding power aroused the
jealousy, sometimes the enmity, of the secular Catholic clergy. Some of
these believed in the superior authority of ecumenical councils over the
popes; the Jesuits defended the supreme author- ity of the popes over
councils and kings. Spanish businessmen complained that Jesuits engaging
in colonial commerce were underselling regular mer- chants because of
ecclesiastical exemption from taxation; and this, it was pointed out,
lessened royal revenues. Charles believed that the Jesuits were still
encouraging the resistance of the Paraguayan Indians to the orders of
the Spanish government. 37 And he was alarmed when Aranda, Campomanes,
and others showed him letters which, they alleged, had been found in the
cor- respondence of the Jesuits; one of these letters, supposedly from
Father Ricci, general of the order, declared that Charles was a bastard
and should be super- seded by his brother Luis. 38 The authenticity of
these letters has been rejected by Catholics and unbelievers alike; 39
but Charles thought them genuine, and concluded that the Jesuits were
plotting to depose him, perhaps to have him killed. 40 He noted that an
attempt had been made, allegedly with Jesuit com- plicity, to
assassinate Joseph I of Portugal (1758). He determined to follow
Joseph’s example, and expel the order from his realm.</p>
<p>Campomanes warned him that such a move could succeed only through
secret preparations followed by a sudden and concerted blow; otherwise
the Jesuits, who were revered by the people, could arouse a troublesome
furor throughout the nation and its possessions. On Aranda’s suggestion
sealed messages, signed by the King, were sent out early in 1 767 to
officials every-</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>where in the empire, with orders, on pain of death, to open them only
on March 31 in Spain, on April 2 in the colonies. On March 31 the
Spanish Jesuits awoke to find their houses and colleges surrounded by
troops, and themselves placed under arrest. They were ordered to depart
peaceably, taking only such possessions as they could carry with them;
all other Jesuit property was confiscated by the state. Each of the
exiles was granted a small pension, which was to be discontinued if any
Jesuit protested the expulsion. They were taken in carriages under
military escort to the nearest port, and shipped to Italy. Charles sent
word to Clement XIII that he was transporting them “to the
ecclesiastical territories, in order that they may remain under the wise
and immediate direction of his Holiness…. I request your Holi- ness not
to regard this resolution otherwise than as an indispensable civil
precaution, which I have adopted only after mature examination and pro-
found reflection.” 41</p>
<p>When the first vessel, bearing six hundred Jesuits, sought to deposit
them at Civitavecchia, Cardinal Torrigiani, papal secretary, refused to
let them land, arguing that Italy could not so suddenly take care of so
many refugees. 42 For weeks the ship roamed the Mediterranean seeking
some hospitable port, while its desperate passengers suffered from
weather, hunger, and disease. Finally they were allowed to debark in
Corsica; and later, in manageable groups, they were absorbed into the
Papal States. Meanwhile the Jesuits experienced similar banishment from
Naples, Parma, Spanish America, and the Philippines. Clement XIII
appealed to Charles III to revoke edicts whose suddenness and cruelty
must shock all Christendom. Charles replied: “To spare the world a great
scandal I shall ever preserve, as a secret in my heart, the abominable
plot that necessitated this rigor. Your Holiness ought to be- lieve my
word: the safety of my life exacts of me a profound silence.” 43</p>
<p>The King never fully revealed the evidence upon which he had based
his decrees. The details are so controverted and obscure that judgment
is baffled. D’Alembe rt, no friend of the Jesuits, questioned the method
of their banish- ment. On May 4, 1767, he wrote to Voltaire:</p>
<p>What do you think of the edict of Charles III, so abruptly expelling
the Jesuits? Persuaded as I am that he had good and sufficient reasons,
do you not think that he ought to have made them known, and not shut
them up in his “royal heart”? Do you not think he ought to have allowed
the Jesuits to justify themselves, especially since everyone is sure
they could not? Do you not think, too, that it would be very unjust to
make them all die of starvation if a single lay brother, who perhaps is
cutting cabbage in the kitchen, should say a word, one way or the other,
in their favor?… Does it not seem to you that he could act with more
common sense in carrying out what, after all, is a reasonable matter ?
44</p>
<p>Was the expulsion popular? A year after its completion, on the
festival of St. Charles, the King showed himself to the people from the
balcony of his palace. When, following custom, he asked what gift they
desired of him, they cried out “with one voice” that the Jesuits should
be allowed to return, and to wear the habit of the secular clergy.
Charles refused, and banished the</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 285</p>
<p>Archbishop of Toledo on charge of having instigated the suspiciously
con- cordant petition. 45 When, in 1769, the Pope asked the bishops of
Spain for their judgment on the expulsion of the Jesuits, forty-two
bishops approved, six opposed, eight gave no opinion. 46 Probably the
secular clergy were con- tent to be relieved of Jesuit competition. The
Augustinian friars of Spain approved the expulsion, and later supported
the demand of Charles III that the Society of Jesus be completely
dissolved. 47</p>
<p>No such summary action could be taken with the Inquisition. Far more
deeply than the Society of Jesus it was mortised in the awe and
tradition of the people, who ascribed to it the preservation of morals
and the purity of their faith — even of their blood. When Charles III
came to the throne the Inquisition held the mind of Spain by a severe
and watchful censorship. Any book suspected of religious heresy or moral
deviation was submitted to c alt fic adores — qualifiers, or examiners;
if they thought it dangerous they sent their recommendations to the
Consejo de la Inquisicion; this could decree the suppression of the book
and the punishment of the author. Periodically the Inquisition published
an Index of prohibited books; to own or read one of these without
ecclesiastical permission was a crime that only the Inquisition could
forgive, and for which the offender could be excommunicated. Priests
were required, especially in Lent, to ask all penitents whether they
had, or knew anyone who had, a prohibited book. Any person failing to
report a violation of the Index was considered as guilty as the
violator, and no ties of family or friendship could excuse him. 48</p>
<p>Charles’s ministers here accomplished only minor reforms. In 1768 the
Inquisitorial censorship was checked by requiring that all edicts
prohibiting books should secure royal approval before being put into
effect. In 1770 the King or dered the Inquisition’s tribunal to concern
itself only with heresy and apostasy, and to imprison no one whose guilt
had not been conclusively established. In 1784 he ruled that proceedings
of the Inquisition regarding grandees, cabinet ministers, and royal
servants must be submitted to him for review. He appointed Inquisitor
generals who showed a more liberal attitude toward diversities of
thought. 49</p>
<p>These modest measures had some effect, for in 1782 the Inquisitor
General sadly reported that fear of ecclesiastical censure for reading
forbidden books was “nearly extinct.” 50 In general the agents of the
Inquisition, after 1770, were milder, its penalties more humane, than
before. Toleration was granted to Protestants under Charles III, and in
1779 to Moslems, though not to Jews. 51 There were four autos-da-fe
during the reign of Charles III, the last in 1780 at Seville, of an old
woman accused of witchcraft; and this execution aroused such criticism
throughout Europe 52 that the way was prepared for the suppression of
the Spanish Inquisition in 1813.</p>
<p>Nevertheless even under Charles III freedom of thought, if expressed,
was still legally punishable with death. In 1768 Pablo Olavide was
denounced to the Inquisition as having pornographic paintings in his
Madrid home — per- haps some copies of Boucher’s nudes, for Olavide had
traveled in France,</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>even to Ferney. A more serious charge was laid against him in 1774 —
that in the model villages established by him in Sierra Morena he had
allowed no monasteries, and had forbidden the clergy to say Mass on
weekdays, or beg for alms. The Inquisition notified the King that these
and other offenses had been proved by the testimony of eighty witnesses.
In 1778 Olavide was sum- moned to trial; he was accused of upholding the
Copernican astronomy, and of corresponding with Voltaire and Rousseau.
He abjured his errors, was “reconciled” with the Church, su ffered
confiscation of all his property, and was sentenced to confinement in a
monastery for eight years. In 1780 his health collapsed, and he was
allowed to take the waters at a spa in Catalonia. He escaped to France,
and received a hero’s welcome from his philosophic friends in Paris. But
after some years of exile he grew unbearably lonesome for his Spanish
haunts. He composed a pious work, The Gospel Triumphant, or The
Philosopher Converted, and the inquisition permitted his return. 53</p>
<p>We note that the trial of Olavide occurred after the fall of Aranda
from his place at the head of the Consejo de Castilla. In his final
years of power Aranda founded new schools, taught by secular clergy, to
supply the void left by the Jesuits; and he reformed the currency by
replacing debased coins with money of good quality and superior design
(1770). However, his sense of his superior enlightenment made him in
time irritable, overbearing, and presumptuous. After making the power of
the king absolute, he sought to limit it by increasing the authority of
the ministers. He lost perspective and measure, and dreamed of bringing
Spain, in one generation, out of its con- tented Catholicity into the
stream of French philosophy. He expressed too boldly his heretical
ideas, even to his confessor. Though many of the secular clergy
supported some of his ecclesiastical reforms as beneficial to the
Church, 54 he frightened many more by disclosing his hope of completely
disbanding the Inquisition. 55 He became so unpopular that he did not
dare go out of his palace without a bodyguard. He complained so often of
the burdens of office that at last Charles took him at his word and sent
him as ambassador to France (1773-87). There he predicted that the
English colo- nies in America, which were beginning their revolt, would
in time become one of the great powers of the world. 58</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The New Economy</li>
</ol>
<p>Three able men dominated the ministry after Aranda’s departure. Jose
Monino, Conde de Floridablanca, succeeded Grimaldi as secretary of state
for foreign affairs (1776), and dominated the cabinet till 1792. Like
Aranda, but in less degree, he felt the influence of the philosophes. He
guided the King in measures for improving agriculture, commerce,
education, science, and art; but the French Revolution frightened him
into conservatism, and he led Spain into the first coalition against
Revolutionary France (1792). Pedro de Campomanes presided over the
Council of Castile for five years, and was the prime mover in economic
reform. Gaspar Melchor de Jove- llanos, “the most eminent Spaniard of
his age,” 57 came into public view as</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 287</p>
<p>a humane and incorruptible judge in Seville (1767) and Madrid (1778).
Most of his activity in the central government followed 1789, but he
con- tributed powerfully to economic policy under Charles III with his
Informe sobre un proyecto de ley agraria (1787); this proposal for a
revision of agri- cultural law, written with almost Ciceronian elegance,
gave him a European reputation. These three men, with Aranda, were the
fathers of the Spanish Enlightenment and the new economy. On the whole,
in the judgment of an English scholar, their “result for good rivals
that achieved in an equally short time in any other country; and in the
history of Spain there is certainly no period which can compare with the
reign of Charles III.” 58</p>
<p>The obstacles to reform in Spain were as great in economy as in
religion. The concentration of inalienable ownership in titled families
or ecclesiastical corporations, and the monopoly of wool production by
the Mesta seenWd to be insurmountable barriers to economic change.
Millions of Spaniards took pride in indolence, and showed no shame in
begging; change was distrusted as a threat to idleness.* Money was
hoarded in palace coffers and church treasuries instead of being
invested in commerce or industry. The expulsion of Moors, Jews, and
Moriscos had removed many sources of agricultural betterment and
commercial development. Difficulties of internal communica- tion and
transport left the interior a century behind Barcelona, Seville, and
Madrid.</p>
<p>Despite these deterrents, in Madrid and other centers men of good
will — nobles, priests, and commoners, without distinction of sex —
formed Socie- dades Economicas de los Amigos del Pais to study and
promote education, science, industry, commerce, and art. They founded
schools and libraries, translated foreign treatises, offered prizes for
essays and ideas, and raised money for progressive economic undertakings
and experiments. Acknowl- edging the influence of French physiocrats and
Adam Smith, they con- demned the national accumulation of gold as a
monument to stagnation, and one of them asserted: “The nation tha t has
the most gold is the poorest,… as Spain has shown.” 60 Jovellanos hailed
“the science of civil economy” as “the true science of the state.” 61
Economic treatises multiplied. Campomanes’ Discurso sobre el fo?nento de
la industria popular inspired thousands, includ- ing the King.</p>
<p>Charles began by importing grain and seed for regions where
agriculture had decayed. He urged towns to lease their uncultivated
common lands to peasants at the lowest practical rent. Floridablanca,
using crown revenues from vacant ecclesiastical benefices, established
in Valencia and Malaga monte s ptos (pious funds) for lending money to
farmers at low interest. To check deforestation and erosion, Charles
ordered all communes to plant, each year, a fixed number of trees; hence
came that annual celebration of “Arbor Day” which was still, in both
hemispheres, a wholesome custom in our youth. He encouraged the
disregard of old entails, discouraged new ones, and thereby facilitated
the breakup of large estates into peasant properties.</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>The privileges of the Mesta sheep monopoly were sharply reduced;
large tracts of land formerly reserved by it for pasturage were opened
to cultiva- tion. Foreign colonists were brought in to people sparsely
inhabited areas; so, in the Sierra Morena region of southwestern Spain,
hitherto abandoned to robbers and wild beasts, Olavide created (1767 f.)
forty-four villages and eleven towns of French or German immigrants;
these settlements became famous for their prosperity. Extensive canals
were dug to connect rivers and irrigate large tracts of formerly arid
land. A network of new roads, which for a time were the best in Europe,
62 bound the villages and the towns in a quickened facility of
communication, transport, and trade.</p>
<p>Governmental aid went to industry. To remove the stigma traditionally
attached to manual labor, a royal decree declared that craft occupations
were compatible with noble rank, and that craftsmen were henceforth
eligible to governmental posts. Model factories were established: for
textiles at Guada- lajara and Segovia; for hats at San Fernando; for
silks at Talavera; for porce- lain at Buen Retiro; for glass at San
Ildefonso; for glass, cabinetry, and tapestry at Madrid. Royal edicts
favored the development of large-scale capitalistic production,
especially in the textile industry. Guadalajara in 1780 had eight
hundred looms employing four thousand weavers; one company at Barcelona
managed sixty factories with 2,162 cotton-weaving looms; Valencia had
four thousand looms weaving silk, and, favored by its facilities for
export, was cutting into the silk trade of Lyons. By 1792 Barcelona had
eighty thousand weavers, and ranked second only to the English Midlands
in the production of cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Seville and Cadiz had long enjoyed a state-protected monopoly of com-
merce with Spain’s possessions in the New World; Charles III ended this
privilege, and allowed various ports to trade with the colonies; and he
ne- gotiated a treaty with Turkey (1782) that opened Moslem harbors to
Span- ish goods. The results were beneficial to all parties. Spanish
America grew rapidly in wealth; Spain’s income from America rose eight
hundred per cent under Charles III; her export trade was tripled. 63</p>
<p>The expanding activities of the government required enlarged
revenues. These were raised in some measure by state monopolies in the
sale of brandy, tobacco, playing cards, gunpowder, lead, mercury,
sulfur, and salt. At the outset of the reign there were sales taxes of
fifteen per cent in Catalonia, fourteen per cent in Castile. Jovellanos
aptly described sales taxes: “They sur - prise their prey… at its birth,
pursue and nip it as it circulates, and never lose sight of it or let it
escape, until the moment of its consumption.” 64 Under Charles the sales
tax in Catalonia was abolished, and in Castile it was reduced to two,
three, or four per cent. 65 A moderate graduated tax was laid upon
incomes. To secure additional funds by putting the savings of the people
to work, Francisco de Cabarrus persuaded the Treasury to issue
interest-bear- ing government bonds. When these fell to seventy-eight
per cent of their par value, he founded (1782) the first national bank
of Spain, the Banco de San Carlos, which redeemed the bonds at par and
restored the financial credit of the state.</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 289</p>
<p>The result of statesmanship and enterprise was a substantial rise in
the prosperity of the nation as a whole. The middle classes profited
most, for it was their organizations that remade the Spanish economy. At
Madrid 375 businessmen composed five great merchant guilds — the Cinco
Gremios Ma- yores — which controlled most of the trade of the capital;
we may judge their wealth from the fact that in 1776 they lent thirty
million reales to the government. 66</p>
<p>Generally the government favored this rise of the business class as
indis- pensable to freeing Spain from economic and political dependence
upon states with a more advanced economy. Here, as there, the growing
prole- tariat had little share in the new affluence. Wages rose,
especially in Cata- lonia, where the well-to-do complained that servants
were hard to find and hard to keep; 67 but, by and large, prices rose
faster than wages, and the “working classes” were as poor at the end of
the reign as at the beginning. An Englishman traveling in Valencia in
1787 remarked the contrast between “the opulence of… mercha nts,
manufacturers, ecclesiastics, the military, or gentlemen of landed
property,” and the “poverty, wretchedness, and rags” visible “in every
street.” 68 So the middle classes welcomed the Luces— the Enlightenment
coming in from France and England — while their em- ployees, crowding
the churches and kissing the shrines, comforted themselves with divine
grace and hopes of paradise.</p>
<p>The cities expanded under the new economy. The great maritime centers
— Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Cadiz — had populations ranging from
80,000 to 100,000 (1800). Madrid in. 1797 had 167,607, plus 30,000
foreigners. When Charles III came to the throne the city had the
reputation of being the dirtiest capital in Europe. In the poorer
quarters people still emptied their garbage into the streets, relying
upon wind or rain tq distribute it; when Charles forbade this they
denounced him as a tyrant. “The Spaniards,” he said, “are children, who
cry when they are washed.” 69 Nevertheless his agents established a
system of garbage-collection and sewage, and scavengers were organized
to gather offal for fertilizer. 70 An effort to suppress mendicancy
failed; the people refused to let the police arrest beggars — especially
the blind ones, who had formed themselves into a powerful guild.</p>
<p>Year by year Charles improved his capital. Water was led from the
moun- tains into seven hundred fountains, from which 720 water carriers
laboriously delivered it to the houses of the city. The streets were
lighted by oil lamps from nightfall to midnight during six months of
autumn and winter. Most streets were narrow and tortuous, following old
and devious paths and hiding from the summer sun; but some fine avenues
were laid out, and the people enjoyed spacious parks and shady
promenades. Especially popular was the Paseo del Prado, or Meadow Walk,
cooled with fountains and trees, and favored for amorous reconnaissance
and rendezvous. There, in 1785, Juan de Villanueva began to build the
Museo del Prado. And there, almost any day, four hundred carriages drove
by, and, any evening, thirty thousand Madrilenos gathered. They were
forbidden to sing ribald songs, or bathe nude in the fountains, or play
music after midnight; but they enjoyed the</p>

<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>melodious cries of women selling naranjas, limas, and avellanas —
oranges, limes, and hazelnuts. At the end of the eighteenth century,
said travelers, the spectacle visible daily on the Prado equaled that
which in other cities of that period could be seen only on Sundays and
holidays. 71 Madrid became then, as it has again become in our time, one
of the most beautiful cities in Europe.</p>
<p>Charles III was not as successful in foreign policy as in domestic
affairs. The revolt of the English colonies in America seemed to offer a
chance to avenge the losses suffered by Spain in the Seven Years’ War;
Aranda urged Charles to help the revolutionists; the King secretly sent
the rebels a million livres (June, 1776). Attacks by English corsairs
upon Spanish shipping fi- nally led Spain to declare war (June 23,
1779). A Spanish force recaptured Minorca, but an attempt to take
Gibraltar failed. An invasion of England was prepared, but was
frustrated by “Protestant” storms. In the Peace of Ver - sailles Spain
(1783) withdrew its demand for Gibraltar, but regained Florida.</p>
<p>The failure to restore Spain’s territorial integrity saddened the
King’s final years. The wars had consumed much of the wealth which the
new economy had produced. His brilliant ministers had never overcome two
powerful forces of conservatism — the grandees with their vast estates,
and the clergy with their vested interest in the simplicity of the
people. Charles himself had seldom wavered in his basic fidelity to the
Church. His people never ad- mired him so much as when, meeting a
religious procession, he gave his coach to the prelate who was carrying
the Host, and then joined the retinue on foot. His religious devotion
won the affection which had been withheld from him, as a stranger from
Italy, in the first decade of his reign. When he died (December 14,
1788), after fifty-four years of rule in Naples and Spain, there were
many who reckoned him, if not the greatest, certainly the most
beneficent king that Spain had ever had. His kindly nature shone out
when, on his deathbed, he was asked by the attending bishop had he yet
pardoned all his enemies. “How should I wait for this pass bef ore
forgiving them?” he asked. “They were all forgiven the moment after the
offense.” 72</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE SPANISH CHARACTER</li>
</ol>
<p>What sort of people were they, these Spaniards of the eighteenth cen-
tury? By all reports their morals were good, compared with their peers
in England or France. Their intense religion, their courage and sense of
honor, their family coherence and discipline provided strong correctives
to their sexual sensitivity and their pugnacious pride, even while
sanctioning a pas- sionate chauvinism of race and faith. Sexual
selection promoted courage, for Spanish women, desiring protection, gave
their most intoxicating smiles to those men who dared the bulls in the
arena or the streets, or who quickly re- sented and avenged an insult,
or who returned with glory from the wars.</p>
<p>Sexual morality had softened with the influx of French ideas and
ways. Girls were closely guarded, and parental consent (after 1766) was
a legal requisite for marriage; but after marriage the women in the
larger cities in-</p>

<p>29</p>
<p>dulged in flirtations. The cortejo or cicisbeo — c ourtier or
attendant cavalier — became a necessary appendage to a woman of fashion,
and adultery in- creased. 73 One small group, the majos and majas,
constituted a unique aspect of Spanish life. The maps were men of the
lower class who dressed like dandies, wore long capes, long hair, and
broad-rimmed hats, smoked big cigars, were always ready for a fight, and
lived a Bohemian life financed as often as possible by their majas —
their mistresses. Their sexual unions paid no attention to law; often
the maja had a husband who supported her while she supported her majo.
Half the world knows the maja, garbed or not, from Goya’s brush.</p>
<p>Social morality was relatively high. Political and commercial
corruption existed, but not on the scale known in France or England; a
French traveler reported that “Spanish probity is proverbial, and it
shines conspicuou sly in commercial relations.” 74 The word of a Spanish
gentleman was moral tender from Lisbon to St. Petersburg. Friendship in
Spain was often more lasting than love. Charity was plentiful. In Madrid
alone religious institutions daily distributed thirty thousand bowls of
nourishing soup to the poor. 75 Many new hospitals and almshouses were
established, many old ones were enlarged or improved. Almost all
Spaniards were generous and humane, except to heretics and bulls.</p>
<p>Bullfights rivaled religion, sex, honor, and the family as objects of
Spanish devotion. Like the gladiatorial games of ancient Rome, they were
defended on two grounds: courage had to be developed in men, and bulls
had to die before being eaten. Charles III forbade these contests, but
they were resumed soon after his death. Skillful and riskful toreadors
were the idols of all classes. Each had his following; the Duchess of
Alba favored Costillares, the Duchess of Osuna favored Romero, and these
factions divided Madrid as Gluck and Piccini divided Paris. Men and
women wagered their earnings on the fate of the bulls, and on almost
everything else. Gambling was illegal but universal; even private homes
held gambling soirees, and the hostesses pock- eted the fees.</p>
<p>Genteel male dress gradually abandoned the somber black garb and
stiff collar of an earlier generation for the French habit of colored
coat, long vest of satin or silk, knee breeches, silk stockings, buckled
shoes, all crowned with a wig and a three-cornered hat. Usually the
Spanish woman made a sacred mystery of her charms by swathing them in
lace bodices and long — sometimes hoop-skirts, and using mantilla veils
to hide eyes in whose dark depths some Spaniard would gladly sink his
soul. But whereas in the seven- teenth century a lady rarely allowed her
feet to be seen by a man, now her skirts were shortened to a few inches
above the floor, and the formerly heelless slippers were displaced by
sharp-pointed high-heeled shoes. Preach- ers warned that such indecent
exposure of female feet added dangerous fuel to the already combustible
male. The women smiled, adorned their shoes, flashed their skirts, and
waved their fans, even on winter days. Isabella Far- nese had an armory
of 1,626 fans, some of them painted by artists of na- tional renown.</p>
<p>Social life was restrained in everything but the dance. The evening

<p>blies avoided serious discussion, preferring games, the dance, and
gallantry. Dancing was a major passion in Spain, and sprouted varieties
that became famous in Europe. The fandango was danced to a triple
measure with cas- tanets; the seguidilla was performed by two or four
couples, with castanets and usually with song; its derivative, the
bolero, took form toward 1780, and soon acquired a mad popularity. In
the contradanza a line of men faced a line of women in alternating
approach and retreat, as if symbolizing the tactics of the eternal war
between woman and man; or four couples formed and enclosed a square in
the stately contradanza cuadrada — xht quadrille. Masquerade balls
sometimes drew 3,500 eager dancers, and in Carnival time they danced
till dawn.</p>
<p>These dances made motion a living poetry and a sexual stimulus. “It
was said that a Spanish woman dancing the seguidilla was so seductive
that even a pope and the whole College of Cardinals would be swept off
their dig- nity /’ 76 Casanova himself found something to learn in
Spain:</p>
<p>About midnight the wildest and maddest of dances began…. It was the
fandango, which I fondly supposed I had often seen, but which [here] was
far beyond my wildest imaginings…. In Italy and France the dancers are
care- ful not to make the gestures which render this the most voluptuous
of dances. Each couple, man and woman, make only three steps, then,
keeping time to the music with their castanets, they throw themselves
into a variety of lascivious attitudes; the whole of love from its birth
to its end, from its first sigh to its last ecstasy, is set forth. In my
excitement I cried aloud. 77</p>
<p>He marveled that the Inquisition allowed so provocative a dance; he
was told that it was “absolutely forbidden, and no on e would dare to
dance it if the Conde de Aranda had not given permission.”</p>
<p>Some of the most popular forms of Spanish music were associated with
the dance; so the cante flamenco , or gypsy (“Flemish”) singing, used a
plain - tive and sentimental tone with which all gypsy singers
accompanied the seguidilla gitana. Perhaps these mournful melodies
echoed old Moorish airs, or reflected the somber quality of Spanish
religion and art, or the irritating inaccessibility of the female form,
or the disillusionment following realiza- tion. A more joyous strain
came in with Italian opera (1703) and Farinelli’s arias. The old
castrato , after trilling through two reigns, lost favor under Charles
III, who dethroned him with a line: “Capons are good only to eat.” 78
The Italian influence continued with Scarlatti, and triumphed again with
Boccherini, who arrived in 1768, dominated the music of the court under
Charles III and Charles IV, and remained in Spain till his death
(1805).</p>
<p>By a reverse movement Vicente Martin y Solar, after making a name in
Spain, successfully produced Italian opera in Florence, Vienna, and
St. Peters- burg. Antonio Soler’s harpsichord sonatas rivaled
Scarlatti’s; and Don Luis Mison developed the tonada y or vocal solo,
into the tonadillo as an inter- mezzo of song between the acts of a
play. In 1799 a royal order ended the reign of Italian music in Spain by
forbidding the performance of any piece not written in Castilian
language and presented by Spanish artists. 79</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 293</p>
<p>We cannot sum up the Spanish character in one homogeneous mold. The
Spanish soul varies with the scenery from state to state, and the
afrancesados , or Frenchified Spaniards, who gathered in Madrid, were
quite another type than those natives who had been mortised and tenoned
in Spanish ways. But if we set aside exotic minorities, we may recognize
in the Spanish people a character indigenous and unique. The Spaniard
was proud, but with a silent force that took little from chauvinism or
nationality; it was a pride of in- dividuality, a resolute sense of
solitary struggle against earthly injury, per- sonal insult, or eternal
damnation. To such a spirit the external world could seem of secondary
moment, not worth bothering about or toiling for; noth- ing mattered but
the fate of the soul in the conflict with man and in the search for God.
How trivial, then, were the problems of politics, the race for money,
the exaltation of fame or place! Even the triumphs of war had no giory
unless they were victories over the enemies of the faith. Rooted in that
faith, the Spaniard could face life with a stoic tranquillity, a
fatalism that waited quietly for eventual Paradise.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE SPANISH MIND</li>
</ol>
<p>When Louis XIV accepted the offer of the last Hapsburg King of Spain
to bequeath his crown to a grandson of the Grand Monarque, a Spanish
ambassador at Versailles exclaimed joyfully, “Now there are no more
Pyrenees!” But those gloomy masses stood thei r ground as an obstinate
barrier to French lumieres , and as a symbol of the resistance that
would meet the attempt of a dedicated few to Europeanize the Spanish
mind.</p>
<p>Campomanes startled the old with a Discurso sobre la education
popular de los artesanos y su ]omento (1774-76), which made a wider
extension of popular education an indispensable base for national
vitality and growth. Some high ecclesiastics and great landowners saw no
sense in disturbing the people with unnecessary knowledge that might
lead to religious heresy and social revolt. Undeterred, Jovellanos
labored to spread faith in education. “Numerous are the streams that
lead to social prosperity,” he wrote, “but all spring from the same
source, and that source is public education.” 80 He hoped that education
would teach men to reason, that reason would free them from superstition
and intolerance, and that science, developed by such men, would use the
resources of nature for the conquest of disease and pov- erty. Some
noble ladies took up the challenge, and formed a Junta de Damas to
finance primary schools. Charles III spent considerable sums in
establish- ing free elementary schools. Private individuals joined in
founding academies for the study of language, literature, history, art,
law, science, or medicine.</p>
<p>The expulsion of the Jesuits compelled and facilitated the remolding
of secondary schools. Charles ordered an expansion of science courses in
these colleges, a modernization of their textbooks, and the admission of
laymen to their faculties. He endowed colleges, and gave pensions to
outstanding teachers. 81 The universities were advised to admit Newton
to their courses</p>
<p>294 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XI</p>
<p>in physics, and Descartes and Leibniz into their courses in
philosophy. The University of Salamanca rejected the advice on the
ground that “the prin - ciples of Newton… and Cartesio do not resemble
the revealed truth as much as do those of Aristotle”; 82 but m ost
Spanish universities accepted the royal directive. The University of
Valencia, with 2,400 students, was now (1784) the largest and most
progressive educational center in Spain. Several religious orders
adopted filosofia moderna in their colleges. The general of the
Discalced Carmelites urged Carmelite teachers to read Plato, Aristotle,
Cicero, Francis Bacon, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Locke, Wolff, Con-
dillac; here was no regimen for saints. One chapter of the Augustinian
Friars studied Hobbes, another studied Helvetius. Such studies were
always fol- lowed by refutations, but many an ardent soul has lost his
faith in refuting its enemies.</p>
<p>One remarkable monk had “modernized” while Charles III was still a
youth. Though spending the last forty-seven years ( 1 7 1 7-64) of his
life in a Benedictine monastery at Oviedo, Benito Jeronimo Feijoo y
Montenegro managed to study Bacon, Descartes, Galileo, Pascal, Gassendi,
Newton, and Leibniz; and he saw with wonder and shame how Spain, since
Cervantes, had been isolated from the main currents of European thought.
From his cell he sent forth, between 1726 and 1739, a series of eight
volumes which he called Teatro crttico — not dramatic criticism, but a
critical examination of ideas. He attacked the logic and philosophy then
taught in Spain; lauded Bacon’s plea for inductive science; summarized
the findings of scientists in many fields; ridiculed magic, divination,
bogus miracles, medical ignorance, and popular superstitions; laid down
rules of historical credibility that ruth- lessly punctured fond
national legends; demanded an extension of education to all classes; and
advocated a freer and more public life for women in edu- cation and
society.</p>
<p>A swarm of enemies gathered around his books, impugning his
patriotism and denouncing his audacities. The Inquisition summoned him
before its tribunal, but it could find no explicit heresy in him or his
work. In 1 742 he resumed his campaign with the first of five volumes
entitled Cartas eruditas y curiosas ( Learned and Inquiring Letters). He
wrote a good style, recog- nizing every author’s moral obligation to be
clear; and the public so relished his instruction and his courage that
fifteen editions of the Teatro and the Cartas were required by 1786. He
could not banish superstition from Spain; witches, ghosts, and demons
still peopled the air and frightened the mind; but a beginning had been
made, and it is to the credit of his order that this had been done by a
monk who remained unmolested in his modest cell until his death at
eighty-eight ( 1 764).</p>
<p>It was another cleric who wrote the most famous prose work of eight-
eenth-century Spain. Just as the Benedictines saw that no harm should
come to Feijoo, so the Jesuits protected one of their priests whose
chief production was a satire of sermons. Jose Francisco de Isla was
himself an eloquent preacher, but he was first amused, then disturbed,
by the oratorical tricks, the literary conceits, the histrionics and
buffoonery with which some preach-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 295</p>
<p>ers caught the attention and pennies of the people in churches and
public squares. In 1758 he made high fun of these evangelists in a novel
called Historic! del famoso predicador Fray Genmdio. Brother Gerund,
said Father Isla,</p>
<p>always began his sermons with some proverb, some pothouse witticism,
or some strange fragment which, taken from its context, would seem at
first blush to be an inconsequence, a blasphemy, or an impiety, until at
last, having kept his audience waiting a moment in wonder, he finished
the clause, and came out with an explanation that reduced the whole to a
sort of miserable trifling. Thus, preaching one day on the mystery of
the Trinity, he began his sermon by say- ing, “I deny that God exists a
Unity in essence and a Trinity in person,” and then stopped short for an
instant. The hearers, of course, looked around,… wondering what would be
the end of this heretical blasphemy. At length, when the preacher
thought he had fairly caught them, he went on: “Thus say the Ebionite,
the Marcionite, the Arian, the Manichean, the Socinian; but I prove it a
gainst them all from the Scriptures, the Councils, and the Fathers.”
83</p>
<p>Within a day of its publication eight hundred copies of Fray Gerundio
were sold. The preaching friars assailed it as encouraging disrespect of
the clergy. Isla was summoned before the Inquisition, and his book was
condemned (1760), but he himself was not punished. Meanwhile he joined
his fellow Jesuits in exile, and on the road suffered an attack of
paralysis. He spent his declining years at Bologna, living on the
pittance allowed him by the Span- ish government.</p>
<p>Almost every Spaniard who could write wrote poetry. At a poetic joust
in 1727 there were 150 competitors. Jovellanos added poetry and drama to
his activities as jurist, educator, and statesman. His home in Madrid
became a meeting place for men of letters. He composed satires in the
manner of Juvenal, rebuking the corruption he had found in government
and law; and, like any city dweller, he sang the joys of rural peace. —
Nicolas Fernandez de Moratfn composed an epic canto on the exploits of
Cortez; we are told that this is “the noblest poem of its class produced
in Spain during the eight - eenth century.” 84 The gay and gracious
verses of Diego Gonzalez, an Au - gustinian friar, were more popular
than the didactic Four Ages of Man which he dedicated to Jovellanos. —
Don Tomas de Iriarte y Oropesa also indulged a didactic bent in his poem
On Music; better were his Fables (1782), which chastised the foibles of
pundits and earned him a reputation that still survives. He translated
tragedies by Voltaire and comedies by Moliere; he made fun of the monks
“who hold sway over the heavens and two thirds of Spain”; he was
prosecuted by the Inquisition, recanted, and died of syphilis at
forty-one ( 1 79 1 ) , 85</p>
<p>In 1780 the Spanish Academy offered an award for an eclogue
celebrating pastoral life. Iriarte won second prize and never forgave
the victor, for Juan Melendez Valdes went on to become the leading
Spanish poet of the age. Juan wooed Jovellanos, and through him obtained
the chair of humanities at Salamanca (1781); there he won first the
students, then the faculty, to a more adventurous curriculum, even to
reading Locke and Montesquieu. Be- tween classes he wrote a volume of
lyrics and pastoral poetry — vivid evoca-</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>ions of natural scenery in verses of such delicacy and finish as
Spain had not read for more than a century. The continuing favor of
Jovellanos raised Melendez to the judiciary at Saragossa and to the
chancery court at Vallado- lid, and his poetry suffered from his
politics. When Jovellanos was exiled (1798) Melendez was banished, too.
He turned his pen to denouncing the French invaders of Spain, and Joseph
Bonaparte especially; but in 1808 he returned to Madrid, accepted office
under Joseph Bonaparte, and shocked Spain with poetic flatteries of his
foreign masters. In the war of liberation that deposed Joseph the poet’s
house was sacked by French soldiers , he him- self was attacked by an
angry mob, and he fled for his life from Spain. Be- fore crossing the
Bidassoa into France he kissed the last spot of Spanish earth (1813).
Four years later he died in obscurity and poverty in Montpellier.</p>
<p>Spain should have had good dramatists in this age, for the Bourbon
kings were well disposed toward the theater. Three factors made for its
decline: the strong preference of Isabella Farnese for opera and of
Philip V for Farinelli; the consequent dependence of the theater upon
the general public, whose applause went most to farces, miracles,
legends, and verbal conceits; and the effort of the more serious
dramatists to imprison their plays within the “Aristotelian unities” of
action, place, and time. T he most popular play- wright of the century
was Ramon Francisco de la Cruz, who wrote some four hundred little
farces satirizing the manners, ideas, and speech of the middle and lower
classes, but portraying the sins and follies of the populace with a
forgiving sympathy. Jovellanos, the uomo universale of Spain, put his
hand to comedy, and won both the audience and the critics with his
Delinquente horn ado (1773 ) — The Honored Criminal: a Spanish
gentleman, after repeatedly refusing to fight a duel, finally takes up a
persistent chal- lenge, kills his opponent in a fair fight, and is
condemned to death by a judge who turns out to be his father. Always a
reformer, Jovellanos aimed with his play to obtain a mitigation of the
law that made dueling a capital crime.</p>
<p>The campaign for the Aristotelian unities was led by the poet Nicolas
Fernandez de Moratin, and was carried on to success by his son Leandro.
The early poems of this youth pleased Jovellanos, who secured a berth
for him with the Spanish embassy in Paris. There he made friends with
Goldoni, who turned him to writing plays. Fortune lavished gifts upon
“Moratin the Younger”; he was sent at public expense to study the
theaters in Germany, Italy, and England; and on his return to Spain he
was given a sinecure that allowed him time for literary work. His first
comedy was offered to a Ma- drid theater in 1786, but its presentation
was delayed for four years while managers and actors debated whether a
play obeying the rules of Aristotle and French drama could win a Spanish
audience. Its success was moderate. Moratin took the offensive; in his
Comedia nueva (1792) he made such fun of the popular comedies that the
audience thereafter accepted dramas that studied character and
illuminated life. Moratin was acclaimed as the Spanish Moliere, and
dominated the stage of Madrid until the French invasion of</p>

<p>Goya, to co-operate with the government of Joseph Bonaparte. When Jo-
seph fell, Moratin narrowly escaped imprisonment. He sought refuge in
France, and died in Paris in 1828 — the same year in which the
self-exiled Goya died in Bordeaux.</p>
<p>Vlll. SPANISH ART</p>
<p>What could be expected of it after the ravaging of Spain in the long
War of the Spanish Succession? Invading armies pillaged the churches,
rifled the tombs, burned the pictures, and stabled their horses in
venerated shrines. And after the war a new invasion came; through half a
century Spanish art submitted to French or Italian domination; and when,
in 1752, the Academy of San Fernando was formed to guide and help young
artists, it labored to impress upon them the principles of a
neoclassicism completely uncongenial to the Spanish soul.</p>
<p>Baroque struggled violently to preserve itself, and in architecture
and sculpture it had its way. It triumphed in the towers that Fernando
de Cases y Nova added (1738) to the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela,
and in the north front by Ventura Rodriguez (1764) for that same
monument to Spain’s patron St. James. One of the legends dear to the
people told how a statue of the Virgin on a pillar in Saragossa had come
to life and had spoken to St. James; on that site Spanish piety built
the Church of the Virgen del Pilar; and for that church Rodriguez
designed the Templete, a chapel of marble and silver to house the
Virgin’s image.</p>
<p>Two famous palaces were raised in the reign of Philip V. Near Segovia
he bought the grounds and grange of a monastery; he engaged Filippo
Iuvara of Turin to erect there the Palace of San Ildefonso (1719 f.); he
surrounded the buildings with gardens and twenty-six fountains rivaling
those of Ver- sailles. The ensemble took the name of La Granja, and cost
the people 45,000,000 crowns. It had hardly been finished when, on
Christmas Eve of 1734, fire destroyed the Alcazar, which had been the
royal residence in Madrid since the Emperor Charles V. Philip moved to
Buen Retiro, where Philip IV had built a palace in 1631; this remained
the chief royal seat for thirty years.</p>
<p>To replace the Alcazar Iuvara planned a palacio real — apartments,
offices, council rooms, chapel, library, theater, and gardens — which
would have sur- passed in grandeur any royal residence then known; the
model alone con- tained enough wood to build a house. Before he could
begin construction Iuvara died (1736). Isabella Farnese rejected his
design as impossibly ex- pensive, and his successor, Giovanni Battista
Sacchetti of Turin, raised (1737-64) the royal palace that stands in
Madrid today — 470 feet long, 470 feet wide, 100 feet high. Here the
style of the late Renaissance replaced baroque: the fagade was of Doric
and Ionic columns, and was crowned by a balustrade pointed with colossal
statues of Spain’s early kings. When Na - poleon escorted his brother
Joseph to reign in this palace he said, as they</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>mounted the superb stairway, “You will be better lodged than I.” 86
Charles III moved into this immensity in 1764.</p>
<p>Under French and Italian influences Spanish sculpture lost something
of its wooden severity, and dowered its seraphim with laughter and a
saint or two with grace. Subjects were nearly always religious, for the
Church paid best. So the Archbishop of Toledo spent 200,000 ducats for
the Transparente which Narciso Tome raised (1721) behind the cathedral
choir: a complex of marble angels floating on marble clouds; an opening
in the ambulatory, making the marble luminous, gave the altar screen its
name. The old realism survived in the Christ Scourged 87 of Luis Carmona
— a figure in wood, hor- rible with welts and bloody wounds. Lovelier
are the statues of Faith, Hope, and Charity which Francisco Vergara the
Younger carved for the cathe- drals of Cuen§a (1759); Cean-Bermudez, the
Vasari of Spain, ranked these among the finest products of Spanish
art.</p>
<p>The great name in the Hispanic sculpture of the eighteenth century
was Francisco Zarcillo y Alcaraz. His father and teacher, a sculptor in
Capua, died when Francisco was twenty, leaving him the main support of a
mother, a sister, and six brothers. Too poor to pay for models,
Francisco invited passers-by, even beggars, to share his meal and pose
for him; so, perhaps, he found the figures for his masterpiece, The Last
Supper , now in the Ermita de Jesus in Murcia. With the aid of his
sister Ines, who drew and modeled, his brother Jose, who carved details,
and his priest brother Patricio, who colored the figures and the drapes,
Francisco in his seventy-four years pro- duced 1,792 statues or
statuettes, some with such tasteless devices as an embroidered velvet

A^adrid offered him rich commissions to decorate the royal palace. He
preferred to remain in his native Murcia, which in 1781 gave him a
sumptuous funeral.</p>
<p>Spanish painting in the eighteenth century labored under a double
foreign incubus, from which it did not recover until Goya broke all
shackles with his impetuous and unprecedented art. First came a French
wave, with Jean Ranc, Rene and Michel- Ange Houasse, and Louis-Michel
Vanloo. The last became court painter to Philip V, and painted an
immense canvas of the entire royal family, wigs, hoops, and all. 88 Then
a flock of lively Italians — Vanvitelli, Amigoni, Corrado…</p>
<p>Giambattista Tiepolo and his sons reached Aladrid in June, 1762. On
the ceiling of the throne room in the new royal palace they painted a
vast fresco. The Apotheosis of Spain, celebrating the history, power,
virtues, piety and provinces of the Spanish monarchy: symbolical
mythological figures poised in air, nereids, tritons, zephyrs, winged
genii, chubby putti , virtues and vices flying through the luminous
void, and Spain herself enthroned amid her possessions, and glorified
with all the attributes of good government. On the ceiling of the
guardroom Tiepolo represented Aeneas Conducted to the Temple of
Immortality by Venus; and on the ceiling of the Queen’s ante - chamber
he portrayed again The Triumph of the Spanish Monarchy. In</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 299</p>
<p>1766 Charles commissioned Tiepolo to paint seven altarpieces for the
Church of San Pasquale at Aranjuez; one of these, still brilliant in the
Prado, used the face of a Spanish beauty to represent The Immaculate
Conception of the Virgin. The King’s co nfessor, Padre Joaquin de
Electa, condemned the paganism and crudities of Tiepolo’s work as alien
to the spirit of Spain. Tiepolo repented, and painted a powerful
Deposition from the Cross 89 — a meditation on death brightened by
angels promising resurrection. These efforts exhausted the old Titan; he
died in Madrid in 1770, aged seventy- four. Shortly afterward the
Aranjuez altarpieces were removed, and Anton Raphael Mengs was
commissioned to replace them.</p>
<p>Mengs had come to Madrid in 1761. He was then thirty-three, strong,
confident, masterful. Charles III, who had never felt at ease on
Tiepolo’s fluorescent clouds, saw in the enterprising German just the
man to organize the artwork for the palace. In 1764 Mengs was made
director of the San Fernando Academy, and he ruled Spanish painting
during his stays in Spain. He misinterpreted the classic style into a
bloodless, lifeless immobility, en- raging both old Tiepolo and young
Goya. But he fought beneficently to end the extravagance of baroque
decoration and the fantasies of rococo imagination. Art, said Mengs,
should seek first a “natural style,” by imitating nature faithfully;
only then should it aim at the “sublime style” of the Greeks. How was
sublimity to be achieved? By eliminating the imperfect and irrelevant;
by combining partial perfections, variously found, into ideal forms
conceived by a disciplined imagination, shunning all excess.</p>
<p>Mengs began his work by depicting the deities of Olympus on the
ceiling of the King’s bedchamber. Similar pictures decorated the bedroom
of the Queen. Perhaps perceiving that their Afajesties did not quite
follow him to Olympus, Mengs produced for the royal oratory an
altarpiece, The Nativity of Our Lord and a Descent from the Cross. He
worked hard, ate little, grew irritable, lost his health, thought Rome
would restore it; Charles gave him a leave of absence, which Mengs
extended to four years. In his second Span- ish sojourn (1773-77) he
added more frescoes to the royal palaces in Madrid and Aranjuez. His
health again gave way, and he begged permission to re- tire to Rome. The
good King granted it, and a continuing pension of three thousand crowns
per year.</p>
<p>But were there no native artists then painting in Spain? There were
many, but our interest, waning with distance and time, has left them in
the murky limbo of fading fame. There was Luis Melendez, who almost
equaled Char- din in still lifes ( bordegones , fruteras)-, the Prado
has forty of them, the Boston Aluseum has an appetizing example, but the
Louvre outdoes them all with a wonderful self-portrait. And Luis Paret y
Alcazar, who rivaled Cana- letto in picturing city scenes, as in his
Puerta del So/ 90 — the main square of Afadrid. And Antonio Viladamat,
whom Mengs pronounced the finest Span- ish painter of the age. And the
kindly, surly, devoted Francisco Bayeu y Subias, who won first prize at
the Academy in 1758, designed tapestries for Mengs, and became the
friend, enemy, and brother-in-law of Goya.</p>

<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>FRANCISCO DE GOYA Y LUCIENTES</li>
</ol>
<p>/. Growth</p>
<p>Like all Iberian boys, Francisco took the name of a patron saint,
then the name of his father, Jose Goya, and of his mother, Eugracia
Lucientes — lady of grace and light. She was an hidalga , hence the de
that Francisco inserted into his name. He was born on March 30, 1746, in
Fuentetodos, an Aragon village of 150 souls and no trees — a stony soil,
a hot summer, a cold winter, killing many, making the survivors grim and
tough.</p>
<p>Francisco dabbled with brushes, and, in his boyhood, painted for the
local church a picture of Nuestra Senora del Pilar, patroness of Aragon.
In 1760 the family moved to Saragossa; there the father worked as a
gilder, and earned enough to send his boy to study art under Jose Luzan.
With him and Juan Ramirez Goya copied Old Masters, imitated Tiepolo’s
subtle coloring, and learned enough anatomy to draw forbidden nudes.
Story tells of his joining — soon leading — a band of wild youths who
defended their parish against another, how in one of the brawls some
bravos were killed, and how Francisco, fearing arrest, fled to
Madrid.</p>
<p>In December, 1763, he took an examination for admission to the
Academy, and failed. Legend describes his riotous life in the capital;
we only know that Goya was not in love with laws. He competed again in
17 66, and failed. Perhaps these failures were his fortune: he escaped
the academic tutelage of Mengs, he studied the work that Tiepolo was
doing in Madrid, and he laid the foundations of a unique style pervaded
with personality. The legend tells next how he joined a troupe of
bullfighters and traveled with them to Rome, at a date unknown. He was
always a devotee of toreadors, and once he signed himself “Francisco de
los Toros.” “I used to be a bullfighter in my youth,” he wrote in old
age to Moratrn; “with sword in hand I feared noth - ing.” 91 Perhaps he
meant that he had been one of those venturesome lads who fought bulls in
the streets. In any case he reached Italy, for in 1770 he won second
prize in a competition at the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma. Legend
describes him climbing the dome of St. Peter’s, and breaking into a
convent to carry off a nun. More likely lie was studying the pictures of
Magnasco, whose dark coloring, tortured figures, and Inquisition scenes
may have moved him more deeply than the calm and classic poses that
Mengs had recommended in Spain.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1771 he was back in Saragossa, decorating a chapel in
the cathedral, Iglesia Metropolitana della Nuestra Senora del Pilar.
This he did well, earning fifteen thousand reales for six months’ work;
and now he could support a wife. Since propinquity dominates in
determining our choice of mates, he married (1773) Josefa Bayeu, who had
youth and golden hair and was near at hand. She served as his model, and
he painted her portrait many times; that which hangs in the Prado shows
her tired with many preg- nancies, or saddened by Francisco’s
digressions from monogamy. 92</p>
<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>He returned to Madrid (1775). Probably on Bayeu’s recommendation,</p>
<p>A spirochete intruded upon this prosperity. We do not know the origin
of Goya’s syphilis; we know that he was seriously ill in April, 1777. 93
He recovered gradually, but we may suspect that the ailment had some
influence on the pessimism in his art, perhaps on his loss of hearing in
1793. He was well enough in 1778 to take part in a project of Charles
III to spread abroad, through prints, the treasures of Spanish art. For
this purpose Goya made copies of eighteen paintings by Velazquez; from
these copies he made etch- ings; it was a new skill for him, and his
burin was for a while unsure and crude; but from that beginning he grew
to be one of the greatest etchers since Rembrandt. He was allowed to
present his copies in person to the King, and in 1780 he was enrolled as
one of the court painters. Now at last he was received into the Academy.
About 1785 he made his famous portrait of Charles III, showing him in
hunting costume, dressed to kill, but aged, weary, toothless, bowlegged,
bent; here, as usual, Goya sacrificed favor to truth.</p>
<p>His father having died, Goya brought his mother and brother Camilo to
live with him, Josefa, and the children. To support this enlarged
household he accepted a variety of commissions: to paint a fresco in the
Church of San Francisco el Grande, devotional pictures for the Calatrava
College at Sala- manca, and genre scenes for the country house of the
Duke of Osuna; and to execute portraits as the most lucrative branch of
his profession. He made several of Osuna; 94 one of the Duke and his
family — the children as stiff as dollars; and a three-quarter length of
the Duchess of Osuna 95 — a miracle of oils transfigured into silk and
lace.</p>
<p>Perhaps Goya was happy in 1784. In that year Javier was born, the
only one of his children who would survive him. The frescoes in San
Francisco el Grande were ceremoniously unveiled, and were hailed as the
finest paint- ing of that age; the King and all the court were present,
and joined in the praise. About 1787 Goya painted the portrait of the
Marquesa de Pontejos, which is now one of the prize possessions of the
National Gallery at Wash- ington. A year later he returned to nature in
La Pradera de San Isidro 96 — a.</p>

<p>He was kept busy in 1789 making portraits of the new King and Queen
for their formal entry into Madrid on September 21. Felipe, eldest son
of Charles III, had been barred from the succession as an imbecile; the
crown passed to the second son, whom an unsympathetic historian
described as only “semi - imbecile.” 98 Charles IV was simple and
unsuspecting, and so good as almost to invite wickedness. Presuming
himself, as second son, ex- cluded from the succession, he had taken to
a life of hunting, eating, and parentage. Now, plump and malleable, he
submitted amiably to his wife, Maria Luisa of Parma; he ignored — or was
ignorant of — her adulteries, and promoted her lover, Manuel de Godoy,
to head the ministry ( 1 792-97 ).</p>
<p>The new Queen had played with liberal ideas before her accession, and
Charles IV in his first year encouraged Floridablanca, Jovellanos, and
Cam- pomanes (all of whom Goya portrayed) to continue their program of
re- forms. But the fall of the Bastille frightened Charles IV and
Floridablanca into a political reaction that turned the government back
to full co-operation with the Church as the strongest bulwark of
monarchy. Many of the pro- gressive measures enacted under Charles III
were allowed to lapse; the Inquisition recaptured some of its powers;
the importation of French litera- ture was stopped; all newspapers
except the official Diario de Madrid were suppressed; Jovellanos,
Campomanes, and Aranda were banished from the court. The people rejoiced
in the triumph of their cherished faith. In 1793 Spain joined in the war
of the monarchical powers against revolutionary France.</p>
<p>Amid this turmoil Goya prospered. In April, 1789, he was named pintor
de cdmara — painter to the chamber. When Josefa fell ill and the doctor
pre- scribed sea air, Goya took her to Valencia (1790), where he was
feted as Spain’s new Velazquez. Apparently he was in demand from one end
of Spain to another, for in 1792 we find him in Cadiz as the guest of
Sebastian Martinez. On his way back, at Seville, he was stricken with
dizziness and partial paralysis; he returned to his friend in Cadiz, and
fretted through a lengthy convalescence.</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 303</p>
<p>What was this illness? Bayeu spoke of it vaguely as “of the most
terrible nature,” and doubted that Goya would ever recover.“ Goya’s
loyal friend Zapater wrote in March, 1793: “Goya has been brought to
this pass by his lack of reflection, but he is to be commiserated with
all the pity that his affliction demands.” 100 Many students have
interpreted the dis ease as an. aftermath of syphilis, 101 but the
latest medical analysis rejects this view and diagnoses it as
inflammation of the nerves in the labyrinth of the ear. 102 Whatever the
cause, Goya, returning to Madrid in July, 1793, was stone deaf, and
remained so till his death. In February, 1794, Jovellanos noted in his
diary: “I wrote to Goya, who answered that as a result of his apoplexy
he was not even capable of writing.” 103 But the paralysis gradually
disap - peared, and by 1795 Goya was strong enough to fall in love.</p>
<p>Teresa Cayetana Marla del Pilar was the thirteenth duchess of the
famous Alba line. As her father had imbibed French philosophy, she was
brought up on libertarian lines, with an education that gave her an
alert intellect and an undisciplined will. At thirteen she married the
nineteen-year-old Don Jose de Toledo Osorio, Duke of Alba. Frail and
sickly, the Duke for the most part kept to his home and absorbed himself
in music. Goya portrayed him at the harpsichord confronting a Haydn
score. The Duchess was haughty, beautiful, and sensual; a French
traveler remarked that “she has not a hair on her head that does not
provoke desire”; 104 and she satisfied her own desires without
restriction of morals, expense, or class. She took into her house- hold
a half-wit, a one-eyed monk, and a little Negress who became her
especial pet. Generosity hid in her audacities; she may have taken to
Goya because he was deaf and unhappy, as well as because he could
immortalize her with his brush.</p>
<p>He must have seen her many times before she stood for her portrait by
him, for she fluttered in and out of the court, keeping gossip busy with
her flirtations and her bold hostility to the Queen. His first dated
picture of her shows her in full length, her sharp, thin features
shrouded in a mass of black hair, her right hand pointing to something
on the ground; looking, clearly we read the inscription: “ A la duquesa
de Alba Fco de Goya 1 79 j”,’ 105 there is here a suggestion of
friendship already established. This is not one of Goya’s masterpieces.
Much better is the portrait that he painted, in this year, of Francisco
Bayeu, who had just passed away. In November Goya suc- ceeded him as
director of the school of painting in the Academy.</p>
<p>The Duke of Alba died in June, 1796. The Duchess retired for a
brief</p>
<p>period of mourning to her country estate at Sanlucar, between Seville
and Cadiz. It is not certain that Goya accompanied her; we only know
that he was absent from Madrid from October, 1796, till April, 1797, and
that he recorded in two notebooks some of the things he had seen in
Sanlucar. Most of the drawings show the Duchess: receiving guests,
petting her Negro girl, tearing her own hair in a rage, taking her
siesta (while the maid removes the chamber vessel) , 106 fainting in a
promenade, or flirting with one or another of Goya’s rivals for her
caressing hands. The sketches show his rising jeal - ousy, and picture
also another woman — emerging naked from the bath, lying</p>
<p>304 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>half dressed on the bed, or adjusting the garter on a shapely leg;
perhaps Goya, like the Duchess, indulged in tangents to the curve of
love. Yet it was probably in Sanlucar that he painted his proudest
picture of her 107 — dressed as a saucy maja in a black-and-yellow
costume, with a sash of scarlet and gold about her tiny waist, and a
black mantilla over her head; her right hand (itself a masterpiece of
painting) carries two rings, one bearing the name “Alba,” the other
“Goya”; her index finger points to his name, and the date 1797, traced
in the sandy soil at her feet. He always refused to sell this
portrait.</p>
<p>The bloom of the romance had blown away by the time Goya returned to
Madrid. Some of his Capricho drawings (1797?) accuse her of wanton
surrender to an indecent variety of males. Godoy accused her of seducing
the Minister of War, and wrote to the Queen that “the Alba and all her
suppo rters ought to be buried in a huge pit.” 108 When the Duchess died
(July 23, 1803), age forty, Madrid gossiped that she had been poisoned.
Sympathy went out to her because she had left much of her huge fortune
to her servants; also she bequeathed an ann uity of 3,600 reales to
Goya’s son Javier. The King ordered an inquiry into her death — and put
Godoy at its head. The physician and some attendants of the Duchess were
imprisoned; her will was annulled; her servants were deprived of their
legacies; the Queen was soon wearing Alba’s most beautiful jewels.
109</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">

</ol>
<p>Goya had resigned in 1797 as director of painting at the Academy. He
was too busy now to teach. In 1798 he was chosen to decorate the dome
and tympanums of the Church of San Antonio de la Florida; and though he
troubled the clergy by giving his angels voluptuous limbs, nearly all
agreed that he had transferred to those saintly spaces, in a fury of
inspiration, the life and blood of Madrid’s st reets. On October 31,
1799, he was appointed “First Painter to the Court,” with a salary of
fifty thousand reales per year. He made in 1800 the most famous of all
his paintings: Charles IV and His Family 1 ™— a merciless revelation of
royal imbecility; we shudder to think how this collection of swollen
bodies and stunted souls would have looked without their glamorous
raiment — a virtuosity of radiance rarely surpassed in the history of
art. We are told that the victims expressed complete satis- faction with
the work. 111</p>
<p>In a corner of that picture Goya painted himself. We must forgive the
egotism of his many self-portraits; some of them, doubtless, were
experi- mental studies made with a mirror, like an actor practicing
facial expression before a glass; and two of them are magnificent. The
best of them (Plate 1 of the Caprichos) shows him at fifty, deaf but
proud, with a pugnacious chin, sensual lips, enormous nose, sly and
surly eyes, black hair growing over his ears and almost to his chin,
and, to top it all, a lordly silk hat rising over his massive head like
a challenge to all the fortuitous nobles of the world. Nineteen years
later, after surviving a revolution, he discarded the hat,</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 305</p>
<p>opened his shirt at the neck, and showed himself in a more amiable
mood, still proud, but too confident of himself to stoop to challenges.
112</p>
<p>Portraiture was his forte. Though his contemporaries knew that he
would not flatter them, they eagerly submitted to the verdict of an art
that they hoped would carry them down, for fame or shame, through
centuries. We know of three hundred nobles and eighty-eight members of
the royal family who sat for him; two hundred of these portraits
survive. One of the best is of Ferdinand Guillemardet, the French
ambassador; it was brought to Paris by the sitter, was acquired by the
Louvre in 1865, and played a part in stirring up Goya’s fame in France.
Among Goya’s pictures of children the finest is that of Don Manuel
Osorio de Zuniga, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York;
here Goya touched Velazquez. He rivaled Velazquez again in his gallery
of women, running the range from such scarecrows as The Infanta Maria
Josefa to the “ravishing” Senora Garcia 1 13 and the aging actress La
Tirana 11 * — beauty waning but replaced with character.</p>
<p>The most fully revealed of Goya’s women is the saucy maja who, about
1798, posed unadorned for the Maja Desnuda, and, provocatively dressed,
for La Maja V estida ; these companion pictures attract almost as many
gazers in the Prado as the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. The Desnuda and
Velazquez’ Rokeby Venus are among the few nudes in Spanish painting; to
depict the nude in Spanish art was punishable by a year in prison,
confiscation of goods, and exile. Velazquez ventured it under the
protection of Philip IV, Goya under the protection of Godoy, who agreed
with Goya in preferring sub- stantial bosoms, slim waists, and swelling
hips. Despite legend, Goya’s Maja did not represent the Duchess of Alba,
nor was the V estida painted over- night to replace the Desnuda when the
angry Duke (in the legend) came with a duel in his eye. But the two
pictures were bought by, or given to, the Duchess, and passed at her
death into the collection of Godoy.</p>
<p>While Goya was financing his family with portraits he amused himself
(1796-97?) with etchings and water colors which he published in 1799 as
Los Caprichos — eighty-three caprices of graver, brush, and angry mind,
de- scribing with somber satire and sarcastic captions the manners,
morals, and institutions of his time. The most significant of the series
is No. 43: a man has fallen asleep at his desk while demons swarm about
his head; on the desk is an inscription: “El sueno de la razon produce
monstruos” (The dream of reason produces monsters). Goya interpreted
this to mean “Fantasy aban - doned by reason produces monsters; united
with reason she is the mother of the arts and the source of their
marvels.” 115 This was a thrust at the supersti- tions that darkened the
mind of Spain, but it was also a description of half of Goya’s art. He
was haunted by horrible dreams; the Caprichos espe - cially are ghastly
with them. There the human form is degraded into a hun- dred bloated,
haggard, crippled, bestial shapes; owls and cats leer at us, wolves and
vultures prowl, witches fly through the air, the ground is strewn with
skulls and shinbones, and corpses of newborn children newly dead. It is
as if the diseased imagination of Hieronymus Bosch had leaped across
France and the centuries to enter and disorder Goya’s mind.</p>
<p>30 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Was Goya a rationalist? We can only say that he favored reason
against superstition. In one of his drawings he showed a young woman,
crowned with laurel and holding a scale, chasing black birds with a
whip; underneath this Goya wrote: “Divine Reason, do not spare anyone.”
116 Another shows monks unfrocking themselves; 117 and upon a monk in
prayer he put the face of a lunatic. 118 He pictured The Tribunal of the
Inquisition 119 as a dismal scene of pitiful victims judged by cold
authority. He represented a Jew chained in an Inquisition cell, and
wrote the caption: “Zapat a, your glory will be everlasting”; 120 was
this an echo of Voltaire’s Questions of Zapata?</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Revolution</li>
</ol>
<p>Was Goya a revolutionist? No. He was not even a republican. There is
no sign in his art or his words that he desired the overthrow of the
Spanish monarchy. He attached himself and his fortunes to Charles III,
to Charles IV, to Godoy, to Joseph Bonaparte, and associated gladly with
the nobility and the court. But he had known poverty, he still saw it
around him, he was repelled by the destitution of the masses, their
consequent ignorance and superstition, and the Church’s acceptance of
mass poverty as a natural con - sequence of the nature and inequality of
men. Half of his art commemorated the rich, the other half was a cry for
justice to the poor, a protest against the barbarism of law, the
Inquisition, and war. He was a loyalist in his portraits, a Catholic in
his paintings, a rebel in his drawings; there, with an almost savage
power, he expressed his hatred of obscurantism, injustice, folly, and
cruelty. One drawing represents a man stretched on a rack, with an
inscrip- tion, “Because he discovered the movement of the earth.”
Another pictures a woman in the stocks because “she showed sympathy for
the Liberal cause.”</p>
<p>Who were these Spaniards who called themselves Liberales? They were
apparently the first political faction to use that name. They meant by
it to signalize their desire for liberty — of the mind from censorship,
of the body from degradation, of the soul from tyranny. They had
received gratefully the Luces coming in from the French Enlightenment.
They welcomed the entry of a French force into Spain (1807); indeed,
half of the population welcomed it as an army of liberation; no protest
was heard when Charles IV resigned and his son Ferdinand VII was
enthroned under the protection of Murat’s soldiery. Goya painted a
portrait of the new ruler.</p>
<p>But the mood of the people, and of Goya, changed when Napoleon sum-
moned Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to Bayonne, deposed both of them,
exiled one to Italy, the other to France, and made his brother Joseph
king of Spain. An angry crowd gathered before the royal palace; Murat
ordered his soldiers to clear the square; the crowd fled, but
reassembled, twenty</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) SPAIN AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 307</p>
<p>housand strong, in the Plaza Mayor. When French and Mameluke troops
marched toward the plaza they were fired on from windows and arcades;
infuriated, they entered houses, killing indiscriminately. Troops and
crowd entered into an all-day batde, the famous Dos de Mayo (May 2,
1808); hundreds of men and women fell. From some nearby vantage Goya saw
part of the massacre. 123 On May 3 thirty of the prisoners taken by the
sol- diers were executed by a firing squad, and every Spaniard found
with a gun in his hands was put to death. Nearly all Spain was now in
revolt against the French. A “War of Liberation” spread from province to
province, dis - gracing both sides with bestial ferocities. Goya saw
some of these, and was haunted by their memory till his death. In 1 8 1
1 , fearing the worst, he made his will. In 1812 Josefa died. In 1813
Wellington took Madrid; Ferdinand VII was again king.</p>
<p>Goya celebrated the triumph of Spain by painting two of his most
famous pictures (1814). 124 One, Dos de Mayo, was his reconstruction of
what he had seen, heard, or imagined of the battle between the populace
of Madrid and the French and Mameluke troops. He placed the Mamelukes in
the center, for it was their participation that stirred the hottest
resentment in Spanish memory. We need not ask if the picture is accurate
history; it is brilliant and powerful art, from the gradations of
gleaming colors on the horse of the falling Mameluke to the faces of men
terrified and brutalized by the choice between killing and being killed.
Even more vivid is the com- panion picture, The Shooting of the Third of
May — a. squad of French rifle- men executing Spanish prisoners; nothing
in Goya is more impressive than the contrast of terror and defiance in
the central figure of that massacre.</p>
<p>Still a pensioned pintor de cdmara , but no longer a favorite at the
court, Goya, widowed, silenced, and deaf, retired into the world of his
art. Perhaps in 1812 he made the most powerful of his engravings, The
Colossus 125 — a Hercules with the face of Caliban, seated on the edge
of the earth, a Mars resting after triumphant war. Ever since 1810 he
had been drawing little sketches which he later engraved and printed,
and to which he gave the title The Fatal Consequences of Spain’s Bloody
War with Bonaparte, and other Caprichos. He did not dare publish these
eighty-five drawings; he be- queathed them to his son, whose son sold
them to the Academy of San Fer- nando, which published them in 1863 as
Los Desastres de la Guerra.</p>
<p>These sketches are not usual battle scenes, which disguise killing as
hero- ism and glory; they are moments of terror and cruelty in which the
frail restraints of civilization are forgotten in the ecstasy of
conflict and the in- toxication of blood. Here are houses on fire,
collapsing upon their inmates; women rushing to the battle with stones
or pikes or guns; women raped; men tied to posts before firing squads;
men shorn of a leg, an arm, or a head; a soldier cutting off a man’s
genitals; 126 corpses impaled upon the shar p stumps or limbs of trees;
dead women still clutching their infants at their breast; children
gazing in horror at the slaughter of their parents; dead men cast in
heaps into pits; vultures feasting upon the human dead. Under these
pictures Goya added sardonic captions: “This is what you were born for”;
127</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>“This I saw”; 128 “It happened like this”; 129 “To bury the dead and
be silent.” 180 At the end Goya expressed his despair and his hope:
No. 79 is a woman dying amid gravediggers and priests, and is captioned
“Truth dies”; but No. 80 shows her radiating light, and asks, “Will she
rise again?”</p>

<p>In February, 1819, he bought a country house on the other side of the
Manzanares. It was shaded by trees, and though he could not hear the
music of the brook that bordered it, he could feel the lesson of its
placid continu- ance. The neighbors called his home La Quinta del Sordo,
the House of the Deaf. As Javier had married and made a separate
household, Goya took with him Dona Leocadia Weiss, who served him as
mistress and house- keeper. She was a lusty shrew, but Goya was immune
to her eloquence. She brought with her two children — a boy, Guillermo,
and a lively little girl, Maria del Rosario, who became the solace of
the artist’s declining life.</p>
<p>He badly needed so wholesome a stimulus, for his mind was on the edge
of lunacy. Only so can we understand the pinturas negras with which he
covered many walls of the house that was his asylum. As if reflecting
the darkness of his mind, he painted chiefly in black and white; and as
if faithful to the vagueness of his visions, he gave no certain contours
to the forms, but used rough daubs to quickly fix upon the walls the
fleeting images of a dream. On one of the long side walls he represented
The Pilgrimage of San Isidro — the same festival that he had painted
joyfully in 1788, thirty-one years before; but now it was a gloomy
panorama of bestial and drunken fanatics. On the opposite wall he
gathered even more horrible figures in a Sabbath of Witches awesomely
worshiping a huge black goat as their Satan and commanding god. At the
farther end of the room rose the most hideous form in the history of
art, Saturn Devouring His Offspring — a giant crunch- ing a naked child,
having eaten the head and one arm, and now gorging himself on the other,
splashing blood; 131 perhaps it is an insane symbol of insane nations
consuming their children in war. These are the visions of a man who is
obsessed with macabre imaginings, and madly paints them to drive them
out of himself and immobilize them on the wall.</p>
<p>In 1823 Leocadia, whose Freemason activities had made her fear
arrest, fled to Bordeaux with her children. Goya, left alone with the
madness that he had painted on his walls, decided to follow them. But if
he went without royal permission he would forfeit the official salary
that he was receiving as pintor de camara. He asked for several months’
leave to take the waters at</p>
<p>As he neared death his love for his grandson Mariano became his
dominant passion. He settled an annuity on the boy, and offered to pay
expenses if Javier would bring Mariano to Bordeaux. Javier could not
come, but he sent his wife and son. When they arrived Goya embraced them
with such emo-</p>

<p>ion that he broke down and had to take to his bed. He wrote to his
son: “My dear Javier, I only want to tell you that all this joy has been
too much for me…. May God grant that you can come and fetch them, and
then my cup of happiness will be full.” 132 The next morning his voice
was gone, and half his body was paralyzed. He lingered for thirteen
days, impatiently awaiting Javier, in vain. He died on April 1 6, 1828.
In 1899 his remains were brought from Bordeaux to Madrid and were
interred before the altar of the Church of San Antonio de la Florida,
where, 10 1 years before, he had painted under the dome the pains and
griefs, the joys and loves, of Spanish life.</p>
