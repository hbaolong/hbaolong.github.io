of the Sea</h4>
<p>I 49 2_I 5 I 7</p>
<p>I. COLUMBUS</p>
<p>I T was “manifest destiny” that someone in this age would dare the
perils of the Atlantic to find India or “Cathay.” For two thousand years
legend had told of an Atlantis across the sea; and later myths had
placed beyond the Atlantic a fountain whose waters conferred eternal
youth. The failure of the Crusades compelled the discovery of America;
the domination of the eastern Mediterranean by the Turks, the closing or
obstruction of land routes by the Ottomans at Constantinople and by
anti-Christian dynasties in Persia and Turkestan, made the old avenues
of East-West trade costly and dan- gerous. Italy and even France might
cling to the remnants of that trade over every discouragement of tolls
and war, but Portugal and Spain were too far west to make such
arrangements profitably; their problem was to find an- other route.
Portugal found one around Africa; nothing was left for Spain but to try
a passage west.</p>
<p>The growth of knowledge had long since established the sphericity of
the earth. The very errors of science encouraged audacity by
underestimating the width of the Atlantic, and picturing Asia as lying
ready for conquest and exploitation on the farther side. Scandinavian
mariners had reached Labrador in 986 and 1000, and had brought back news
of an immense continent. In 1477, if we may believe his own account,
Christopher Columbus visited Ice- land, 1 and presumably heard proud
traditions of Leif Ericsson’s voyage to “Vinland.” All that was needed
now, for the great adventure, was money. Bravery abounded.</p>
<p>Columbus himself, in the Mayorazzo or will that he made before
setting out on his third voyage across the Atlantic, named Genoa as his
birthplace. It is true that in his extant writings he always calls
himself by the Spanish name Cristobal Colon, never by the Italian name
Cristoforo Colombo; but this was presumably because he was writing in
Spanish, living in Spain, or sailing for a Spanish sovereign, not
because he had been born in Spain. Possibly his forebears had been
Spanish Christianized Jews who had migrated to Italy; the evidence of
Hebraic blood and sentiment in Columbus is al- most convincing. 2 His
father was a weaver, and Christoforo appears to have</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>CHAP.Xni) THE CONQUEST OF THE SEA 259</p>
<p>followed that craft for a time in Genoa and Savona. The biography
written by his son Ferdinand credits him with studying astronomy,
geometry, and cosmography at the University of Pavia, but the university
records do not list him, and he himself tells us that he became a sailor
at fourteen. 8 For in Genoa every road leads down to the sea.</p>
<p>In 1476 a ship on which he was heading for Lisbon was attacked by
pirates; the vessel foundered; Columbus relates that with the support of
some wreck- age he swam six miles to the shore; but the great admiral
had high powers of imagination. A few months later (he says) he sailed
for England as seaman or captain, thence to Iceland, thence to Lisbon.
There he married, and set- tled down as a maker of maps and charts. His
father-in-law was a mariner who had served Prince Henry the Navigator;
doubtless Columbus heard from him some glowing tales of the Guinea
coast. In 1482, probably as an officer, he joined a Portuguese fleet
that sailed that coast to Elmina. He read with interest, and many
annotations, Pope Pius II’s Historia rerum gestarum, which suggested the
circumnavigability of Africa. 4</p>
<p>But his studies more and more inclined him to the west. He knew that
Strabo, in the first century of our era, had told of an attempt to
circle the globe. He was familiar with Seneca’s lines: “An age will come
in after years</p>
<p>About 1484 he proposed to John II of Portugal that the King should
equip three vessels for a year of exploration across the Atlantic and
back; that Columbus should be appointed “Great Admiral of the Ocean” and
perpetual governor of whatever lands he might discover; and that he
should receive a tenth of all revenues and precious metals thereafter
derived from those lands by Portugal. 6 (Obviously the idea of spreading
Christianity was secondary to material considerations.) The King
submitted the proposal to a com- mittee of savants; they rejected it on
the ground that Columbus’s estimate of the distance across the Atlantic
as merely 2,400 miles was far too small. (It was approximately correct
from the Canary Islands to the West Indies.)</p>
<p>260 the reformation (chap. XIII</p>
<p>In 1485 two Portuguese navigators proposed a similar project to King
John, but agreed to finance it themselves; John gave them at least his
blessing; they sailed (1487), followed too northern a route, encountered
rough westerly winds, and turned back in despair. Columbus renewed his
appeal (1488); the King invited him to an audience; Columbus came just
in time to witness the triumphant return of Bartholomeu Dias from a
successful rounding of Africa. Absorbed in prospects of an African route
to India, the Portuguese government abandoned consideration of a passage
across the Atlantic. Co- lumbus turned to Genoa and Venice, but they too
gave him no encourage- ment, for they had a vested interest in the
eastward route to the East. He commissioned his brother to sound out
Henry VII of England, who invited Columbus to a conference. When the
invitation reached him he had already committed himself to Spain.</p>
<p>He was now (1488) some forty-two years old; tall and thin, with long
face, ruddy complexion, eagle nose, blue eyes, freckles, bright red hair
al- ready turning gray, and soon to be white. His son and his friends
described him as modest, grave, affable, discreet, temperate in eating
and drinking, fervently pious. Others alleged that he was vain, that he
paraded and in- flated the titles he received, that he ennobled his
ancestry in his imagination and his writings, and that he bargained
avidly for his share in the New World’s gold; however, he was worth more
than he asked. He deviated oc - casionally from the Ten Commandments,
for at Cordoba, after his wife’s death, Beatriz Enriquez bore him an
illegitimate son (1488). Columbus did not marry her, but he provided
well for her in his life and his will; and as most dignitaries in those
agile times had such by-products, no one seems to have been put out by
the accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had laid his petition before Isabella of Castile (May 1,
i486). She referred it to a group of advisers presided over by the
saintly Archbishop Talavera. After long delay they reported the plan to
be impracticable, argu- ing that Asia must be much farther west than
Columbus supposed. Neverthe- less Ferdinand and Isabella gave him an
annuity of 1 2,000 maravedis (40? ), and in 1489 they furnished him with
a letter ordering all Spanish munici- palities to provide him with food
and lodging; perhaps they wished to keep an option on his project lest
by some chance it should bestow a continent on a rival king. But when
the Talavera committee, after reconsidering the scheme, again rejected
it, Columbus resolved to submit it to Charles VllI of France. Fray Juan
Perez, head of the monastery of La Rabida, dissuaded him by arranging
another audience with Isabella. She sent him 20,000 mara- vedis to
finance his trip to her headquarters at the siege city of Santa Fe. He
went; she heard his plea kindly enough, but her advisers once more
discoun- tenanced the idea. He resumed his preparations for going to
France (Janu- ary 1492).</p>
<p>THE CONQUEST OF THE SEA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>l6 1</p>
<p>At this critical juncture a baptized Jew prodded the march of
history. Luis de Santander, finance minister to Ferdinand, reproached
Isabella for lack of imagination and enterprise, tempted her with the
prospect of con- verting Asia to Christianity, and proposed to finance
the expedition himself with the aid of his friends. Several other Jews —
Don Isaac Abrabanel, Juan Cabrero, Abraham Senior — supported his plea.
7 Isabella was moved, and of- fered to pledge her jewels to raise the
needed sum. Santander judged this un- necessary; he borrowed 1,400,000
maravedis from the fraternity of which he was treasurer; he added
350,000 out of his own pocket; and Columbus somehow got together 250,000
more.* On April 17, 1492, the King signed the requisite papers. Then or
later he gave Columbus a letter to the Khan of Cathay; it was China, not
India, that Columbus hoped to reach, and which to the end of his life he
thought he had found. On August 3 the Santa Maria (his flagship), the
Pinta, and the Nina sailed from Palos with eighty-eight men, and
provisions for a year.</p>
<p>H. AMERICA</p>
<p>They headed south to the Canary Islands, seeking winds from the east
be- fore they faced into the west. After a long stay at the islands they
ventured forth (September 6) along the twenty-eighth parallel of
latitude — not quite far enough south to get the full boon of the trade
winds; we know now that a still more southerly crossing would have
shortened the distance and tribu- lation to America. The weather was
kindly, “like April in Andalusia,” Co - lumbus noted in his log; “the
only thing wanting was to hear nightingales.” Thirty-three days passed
anxiously. Columbus understated to his men the nautical mileage of each
day; but as he overestimated his speed, his statements were unwillingly
correct. The calms persisting, he changed his course, whereupon, even
more than before, the crew felt lost in the aimless wastes of the sea.
On October 9 the captains of the Pinta and the Nina boarded the flagship
and pleaded for an immediate turnabout back to Spain. Columbus promised
that unless land were sighted in three days he would do as they wished.
On October 10 his own crew mutinied, but he appeased them with the same
pledge. On October 1 1 they drew from the ocean a green branch bearing
flowers; their trust in the Admiral ret urned. At two o’clock the next
morning, under a nearly full moon, Rodrigo de Triana, the lookout on the
Nina, shouted Tierra! tierra! It was land at last.</p>
<p>When dawn came they saw naked natives on the beach, “all of good</p>
<ul>
<li>All these private contributions were later repaid by the government.
Santander was sum- moned before the Inquisition July 17, 1491, on
charges unknown; he was “reconciled,” but apparently relapsed into
heresy or Judaism, for all his property was confiscated; Ferdinand,
however, restored it to his children. 8</li>
</ul>
<p>262 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>stature.” The three captains were rowed to the shore by armed men;
they knelt, kissed the ground, and thanked God. Columbus christened the
island San Salvador — Holy Saviour — and took possession of it in the
name of Ferdi- nand, Isabella, and Christ. The savages received their
future enslavers with civilized courtesies. The Admiral wrote:</p>
<p>In order that we might win good friendship — because I knew that</p>
<p>hey were a people who could better be freed and converted to our Holy
Father by love than by force, I gave to some of them red caps,</p>
<p>and to some glass beads… and many other things of slight value, in
which they took much pleasure. They remained so much our friends that it
was a marvel; and later they came swimming to the ships’ boats, and
brought us parrots and cotton thread… and many other things, and in
exchange we gave them little glass beads…. Finally they</p>
<p>exchanged with us everything they had, with good will. 9</p>
<p>The report of the “friendly and flowing savage” which was to bewitch
Rousseau, Chateaubriand, and Whitman may have begun then and there. But
among the first things that Columbus learned on the island was that
these natives were subject to slave raids by other native groups, and
that they them- selves, or their ancestors, had conquered earlier
indigenes. Two days after landing, the Admiral struck an ominous note in
his journal: “These people are very unskilled in arms…. With fifty men
they could all be subjected and made to do all that one wished.” 10</p>
<p>But alas, there was no gold in San Salvador. On October 14 the little
fleet sailed again, seeking Cipango — Japan — and gold. On October 28 a
landing was made on Cuba. There too the natives were well disposed; they
tried to join their visitors in singing the Ave Maria, and did their
best to make the sign of the cross. When Columbus showed them gold they
seemed to indicate that he would find some at a point in the interior
which they called Cubana- cam — i.e., mid-Cuba. Mistaking this for El
gran can — the Great Khan of China — he sent two Spaniards, with full
diplomatic credentials, to find that elusive potentate. They returned
without locating the Khan, but with a pleasant account of the courtesies
with which they had been everywhere re- ceived. They brought also the
first report, by Europeans, of American to- bacco: they had seen male
and female natives smoking tabaco herbs rolled into a cigar, which was
inserted into the nose. Disappointed, Columbus left Cuba (December 4) ,
taking with him, by force, five native youths to serve as interpreters,
and seven women to comfort them. All died en route to Spain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Columbus’s senior captain, Martin Alonso Pinzon, had de-
serted with his ship to hunt gold on his own. On December 5 Columbus
reached Haiti. There he remained four weeks, welcomed and feasted by
the</p>
<p>CHAP.XIIl) the conquest of the sea 263</p>
<p>natives. He found some gold, and felt himself a bit closer to the
Khan; but his flagship grounded on a reef, and was smashed to pieces by
waves and rocks, on the eve of the Christmas that he had planned to
celebrate as the happiest of his life. Luckily the Nina was near by to
rescue the crew, and the kindly natives ventured out in their canoes to
help salvage most of the cargo before the vessel sank. Their chieftain
consoled Columbus with hospitality and gold, and assurances that there
was plenty of the murderous metal in Haiti. The Admiral thanked God for
the gold, forgave Him for the ship- wreck, and wrote in his journal that
Ferdinand and Isabella would now have funds sufficient to conquer the
Holy Land. He was so impressed with the good manners of the natives that
he left part of his crew as a settlement to explore the island while he
returned to Spain to report his discoveries. On January 6 , 1493, Pinzon
rejoined him with the Pinta; his apologies were ac- cepted, for Columbus
was loath to sail back with only one ship. On January 16 they began the
journey home.</p>
<p>It was a long and miserable voyage. All through January the winds
were hostile, and on February 12 a violent storm buffeted the tiny
ships, which were not much more than seventy feet long. 11 As they
approached the Azores, Pinzon deserted again, hoping to be the first to
reach Spain with the great news that Asia had been found. The Nina
anchored off Santa Maria in the Azores (February 17); half the crew went
ashore, partly to make a pil- grimage to a shrine of the Virgin; they
were arrested by the Portuguese authorities and were kept in jail for
four days while Columbus fretted off- shore. They were released, and the
Nina sailed again; but another storm drove it from its course, split its
sails, and so depressed the sailors that they vowed to spend their first
day on land fasting on bread and water and ob- serving the Ten
Commandments. On March 3 they sighted Portugal, and though Columbus knew
that he was risking a diplomatic mess, he decided to debark at Lisbon
rather than attempt the remaining 225 miles to Palos with one sail. John
II received him with courtesy; the Nina was repaired; and on March 15 it
reached Palos after “infinite toil and terror” (said Columbus), 193 days
after leaving that port. Martin Pinzon had landed on northwestern Spain
several days before, and had sent a message to Ferdinand and Isabella,
but they refused to see him or his messenger. The Pinta sailed into
Palos a day after the Nina. Pinzon fled in fear and disgrace to his
home, took to his bed, and died.</p>
<p>hi. the waters of bitterness</p>
<p>Columbus was welcomed by King and Queen at Barcelona, lived six</p>
<p>months at the court, and received the title Almirante del Mar Oceano
— “Ad - miral of the Ocean Sea”— by which was meant the Atlantic west of
the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Azores. He was made governor of the New World, or, as he described
him- self , “Vice -King and General Governor of the Islands and Terra
Firma of Asia and India.” 12 As John II was rumored to be fitting out a
fleet to cross the Atlantic, Ferdinand appealed to Alexander VI to
define the rights of Spain in the “Ocean Sea.” The Spanish Pope, in a
series of bulls ( 1493), al - lotted to Spain all non-Christian lands
west, and to Portugal all those east, of an imaginary line drawn north
and south 270 miles west of the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. The
Portuguese refused to accept this line of de- marcation, and war was
imminent when the rival governments, by the Treaty of Tordesillas (June
7, 1494), agreed that the line should run along a meridian of longitude
250 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands for dis- coveries before that
date, but 370 leagues west for later discoveries. (The eastern corner of
Brazil lies east of this second line.) The papal bulls termed the new
terrain “Indies”; scholars like Pietro Martire d’ Anghiera accepted</p>
<p>Hoping for gold, Ferdinand and Isabella provided Columbus with a new
fleet of seventeen vessels, equipped with 1,200 seamen, animals to start
flocks and herds in the “Indies,” and five ecclesiastics to shrive the
Spaniards and convert the “Indians.” The second voyage sailed from
Seville on September</p>
<p>The fleet sailed eastward along the Haitian coast. On January 2,
1494, the Admiral landed men and cargo to found a new settlement, which
he called Isabella. After supervising the construction of a town and the
repair of his ships, he left to explore Cuba. Unable to circumnavigate
it, he concluded that it was the mainland of Asia, perhaps the Malay
Peninsula. He thought of rounding it and circling the globe, but his
ships were not equipped for it. He turned back toward Haiti (October 29,
1494), wondering how his new settlement had fared. He was shocked to
find that it had behaved like its predecessor; that the Snaniards had
raped native women, stolen native stores</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII ) THE CONQUEST OF THE SEA 265</p>
<p>of food, and kidnaped native boys to serve as slaves; and that the
natives had killed many Spaniards in revenge. The missionaries had made
little attempt to Christianize the Indians. One friar had joined a group
of malcontents who had sailed back to Spain to give the sovereigns a
discouraging report of Haiti’s reputed resources. Columbus himself now
became a slave dealer. He sent out expeditions to capture 1,500 natives;
400 of these he gave to the set- tlers, 500 he dispatched to Spain. Two
hundred of these died on the voyage; the survivors were sold at Seville,
but died in a few years, unable to adjust themselves to the colder
climate, or perhaps to the savagery of civilization.</p>
<p>Leaving orders with his brother Bartolome to transfer the settlement
from Isabella to a better site at Santo Domingo (now Ciudad Trujillo),
Columbus sailed for Spain (March 10, 1496), and reached Candandandanddiz
after an unhappy voy- age of ninety-three days. He presented his
sovereigns with Indians and gold nuggets; it was not much, but it
modified the doubts that had formed at court about the wisdom of pouring
more money into the Atlantic. The Admiral was uncomfortable on land; the
salt of the sea was in his blood; he begged for at least eight ships for
another trial of fortune. The sovereigns consented; and in May 1498,
Columbus sailed again.</p>
<p>This third voyage moved southwest to the tenth meridian of latitude,
then followed this due west. On July 3 1 the crew sighted the great
island which the pious commander named Trinidad; and on August 3 1 he
saw the main- land of South America, perhaps a year before, perhaps a
year after, Vespucci. After exploring the Gulf of Paria he sailed
northwest, and reached Santo Domingo August 31. This third settlement
had survived, but one of every four of the five hundred Spaniards that
he had left there in 1496 was suffer- ing from syphilis, and the
settlers had divided into two hostile groups that were now on the verge
of war. To appease the discontent, Columbus allowed each man to
appropriate a large tract of land, and to enslave the natives dwell- ing
on it; this became the rule in the Spanish settlements. Worn now with
hardships, disappointments, arthritis, and a disease of the eyes,
Columbus al- most broke down under these problems. His mind clouded
occasionally, he became irritable, querulous, dictatorial, avaricious,
and ruthless in his punish- ments; so at least many of the Spaniards
claimed, and they fretted under an Italian’s rule. He recognized that
the problems of managing the settlement</p>
<p>The sovereigns took him at his word, and appointed Francisco de Boba-
dilla; but, going beyond the Admiral’s request, they gave their
commissioner full authority, even over Columbus. Bobadilla reached Santo
Domingo while Columbus was away, and heard many complaints of the manner
in which Cristoforo and his brothers Bartolome and Diego had ruled what
was now</p>
<p>i 66</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>called Hispaniola. When Columbus returned, Bobadilla had him cast
into jail, with manacles on his arms and fetters on his feet. After a
further inquest the commissioner sent the three brothers, in chains, to
Spain (October i, 1 500). Arriving at Cadiz, Columbus wrote a pitiful
letter to friends at court:</p>
<p>It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes
with</p>
<p>he Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in dis-
cussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nonetheless I
per- sisted therein…. Over there I have placed under their
sovereignty</p>
<p>more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700</p>
<p>islands…. In seven years I, by the divine will, made that
conquest.</p>
<p>At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was
incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains…. The</p>
<p>accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made</p>
<p>by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession of
the</p>
<p>land….</p>
<p>I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom</p>
<p>heir Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to con-
sider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes… now</p>
<p>at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my prop-
erty without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy. 13</p>
<p>Ferdinand was busy dividing the Kingdom of Naples with Louis XII; six
weeks went by before he ordered Columbus and his brothers released, and
summoned them to court. King and Queen received them in the Alhambra,
consoled them, and restored them to affluence, but not to their former
authority in the New World. By the Capitulations or agreement that they
had signed in 1492, the sovereigns were bound to leave Columbus full au-
thority in the lands he had discovered, but they felt that he was no
longer fit to exercise it. They named Don Nicolas de Ovando as new
governor of the Indies; however, they allowed the Admiral to collect all
his property rights at Santo Domingo, and all that was hitherto due him
of the gold dig- gings and trade. Columbus lived the rest of his life a
rich man.</p>
<p>But he was not content. He importuned the King and Queen for one more
fleet; and though they were not yet clear that the “Enterprise of the
Indies” would bring them a net gain, they felt that they owed him
another trial. On May 9, 1 502, from Cadiz, Columbus began his fourth
voyage, with four ships and 140 men, including his brother Bartolome and
his son Fernando. On June 15 he sighted Martinique. On June 29, feeling
a storm in the air and in his joints, he anchored off a sheltered spot
of the Haitian shore near Santo Domingo. A fleet of thirty ships was in
the main harbor, about to sail for Spain. Columbus sent word to the
governor that a hurricane was brewing, and advised him to detain the
vessels for a while. Ovando rejected the warn- ings and dispatched the
fleet. The hurricane arrived; the Admiral’s ships sur -</p>
<p>chap.xiii) the conquest of the sea 267</p>
<p>vived it with minor damage; of the g overnor’s fleet all vessels but
one were wrecked; 500 lives were lost, including Bobadilla’s; and a rich
cargo of gold was surrendered to the sea.</p>
<p>Columbus now began, unsuspectingly, the most arduous and tragic
months in his troubled career. Continuing westward, he reached Honduras,
and ex- plored the coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica in the hope of
finding a strait that would let him circumnavigate the earth. On
December 5, 1 502, a temp- est of wind and rain arose, whose mad force
is vividly described in Colum- bus’s journal:</p>
<p>For nine days I was as one lost, without any hope of life. Eyes
never</p>
<p>beheld the sea so high, angry, and covered with foam. The wind not
only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run be-</p>
<p>hind any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in
this bloody ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky
look more terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a
fur-</p>
<p>nace, and the lightning broke forth with such violence that each time
I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes
came</p>
<p>with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the
ships</p>
<p>would be blasted. All this time the water never ceased to fall from
the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The
men</p>
<p>were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful</p>
<p>suffering. 14</p>
<p>To add to the terror of wind, water, lightning, and rocky reefs near
by, a waterspout — a spray- spreading “twister” in the sea — appeared,
perilously close to the ships, and shooting water “up to the clouds.”
Columbus took out his Bible, and read from it how Christ had stilled the
storm at Capernaum; then he exorcized the waterspout by tracing with his
sword a cross in the sky, whereupon, we are told, the tower of water
collapsed. After twelve awful days the fury passed, and the fleet rested
in a harbor near the present eastern end of the Panama Canal. There
Columbus and his men celebrated sadly the Christmas of 1 502 and the New
Year’s Day of 1503, not knowing that the Pacific was only forty miles
away.</p>
<p>Further misfortunes came. Thirteen sailors, rowing the flagship’s
boat up a river to find fresh water, were attacked by Indians; all but
one of the Span- iards were killed, and the boat was lost. Two vessels
had to be abandoned as too worm-eaten to be seaworthy; the other two
leaked so badly that the pumps had to be worked night and day. Finally
the worms proved stronger than the men, and these surviving ships had to
be beached on a shore of Jamaica (June 25, 1503). There the hapless crew
remained a year and five days, depending for food on the precarious
friendship of the natives, who themselves had little to spare. Diego
Mendez, whose calm courage in all this adversity kept Columbus from
complete despair, volunteered to lead six</p>

<p>Christians and ten Indians in a dugout canoe 455 miles — eighty of
them out of sight of land — to Santo Domingo to solicit aid. On that
venture their water</p>
<p>Four more months passed before help came; even then the ship that
Ovando sent leaked so badly that it was barely able to return to Santo
Domingo. Columbus, with his brother and son, sailed in a stouter vessel
to Spain, arriving November 7 after a long and stormy voyage. The King
and Queen were disappointed that he had not found more gold, or a strait
to the Indian Ocean; and neither Ferdinand nor Isabella, who was dying,
had time to receive the white- haired sailor finally home from the sea.
His “tenths” from Haiti were still paid to him; he suffered from
arthritis, but not from poverty. When at last Ferdinand consented to see
him Columbus, older than his fifty-eight years, could hardly bear the
long journey to the court at Segovia. He demanded all the titles,
rights, and revenues promised him in</p>

bus refused. He followed the court to Salamanca and Valladolid; and
there, broken in body and heart, he died, May 20, 1506. No man had ever
so re- made the map of the earth.</li>

<li>THE NEW PERSPECTIVE</li>

<p>Now that he had shown the way, a hundred other mariners rushed to the
New World. That name was apparently first used by a Florentine merchant
whose own name now describes the Americas. Amerigo Vespucci was sent to
Spain by the Medici to straighten out the affairs of a Florentine
banker. In 1495 he won a contract to fit out twelve vessels for
Ferdinand. He caught the exploration fever, and in letters later
(1503-04) written to friends in Florence, he claimed that he had made
four voyages to what he termed novo mondo , and that on one of these, on
June 16, 1497, he had touched the main- land of South America. As John
Cabot reached Cape Breton Island, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on June
24, 1497, and Columbus sighted Venezuela in</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII ) THE CONQUEST OF THE SEA 269</p>
<p>1498, Vespucci’s account would give him the credit of being the first
Eu - ropean to reach the mainland of the Western Hemisphere since Leif
Ericsson ( c. 1000). Confusion and inaccuracies in Vespucci’s reports
have cast doubt on his claims; but it is noteworthy that in 1 505
Columbus, who by that time should have been able to judge Vespucci’s
reliability, entrusted him with a letter to the Admiral’s son Diego. 15
In 1508 Vespucci was made piloto mayor — chief of all the pilots — of
Spain, and held that position till his death.</p>
<p>A Latin version of one of his letters was printed at Saint-Die
(Lorraine) in April 1507. Martin Waldseemiiller, professor of
cosmography in the Uni- versity of Saint-Die, quoted the letter in his
Cosmo graphiae introduction which he published there in that year; he
accepted Vespucci’s account as trustworthy, and suggested that the name
Amerige or America should be given to what we now term South America. In
1538 Gerhardus Mercator ap- plied American on one of his famous maps, to
all the Western Hemisphere. It is agreed that in 1499, if not in 1497,
Vespucci, sailing with Alonso de Ojeda, explored the coast of Venezuela.
In 1500, shortly after Cabral’s ac - cidental discovery of Brazil,
Vicente Pinzon, who had commanded the Nina on Columbus’s first voyage,
explored the Brazilian coast and discovered the Amazon. In 1513 Vasco
Nunez de Balboa sighted the Pacific, and Ponce de Leon, dreaming of a
fountain of youth, discovered Florida.</p>
<p>The discoveries begun by Henry the Navigator, advanced by Vasco da
Gama, culminating in Columbus, and rounded out by Magellan effected the
greatest commercial revolution in history before the coming of the
airplane. The opening of the western and southern seas to navigation and
trade ended the Mediterranean epoch in the history of civilization, and
began the Atlantic era. As more and more of America’s gold came to
Spain, economic decline progressed in the Mediterranean states, and even
in those South German cities which, like Augsburg and Nuremberg, had
been commercially tied with Italy. The Atlantic nations found in the New
World an outlet for their surplus population, their reserve energy, and
their criminals, and developed there avid markets for European goods.
Industry was stimulated in Western Europe, and demanded the mechanical
inventions, and better forms of power, that made the Industrial
Revolution. New plants came from America to enrich European agriculture
— the potato, tomato, artichoke, squash, maize. The influx of gold and
silver raised prices, encouraged manufacturers, har- assed workers,
creditors, and feudal lords, and generated and ruined Spain’s dream of
dominating the world.</p>
<p>The moral and mental effects of the explorations rivaled the economic
and political results. Christianity was spread over a vast hemisphere,
so that the Roman Catholic Church gained more adherents in the New World
than the Reformation took from her in the Old. The Spanish and
Portuguese lan- guages were given to Latin America, and produced there
vigorous inde-</p>

<p>pendent literatures. European morals were not improved by the
discoveries; the lawless brutality of the colonists flowed back to
Europe with returning seamen and settlers, and brought an
intensification of violence and sexual irregularity. The European
intellect was powerfully moved by the reve- lation of so many peoples,
customs, and cults; the dogmas of the great reli- gions suffered by
mutual attrition; and even while Protestants and Catholics raised their
hostile certainties to ruinous wars, those certitudes were melting away
into the doubts and consequent tolerance of the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Above all, a pride of achievement inspired the human mind just when
Copernicus was about to reduce the cosmic importance of the earth and
its inhabitants. Men felt that the world of matter had been conquered by
the courage of the human mind. The medieval motto for Gibraltar — ne
plus ultra — was denied by abbreviation; it became now plus ultra — more
beyond. All limits were removed; all the world was open; everything
seemed possible. Now, with a bold and optimistic surge, modern history
began</p>
