<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>The Grandeur and Decline of Islam</p>
<p>1058-1258</p>
<p>I. THE ISLAMIC EAST: IO58-I25O</p>
<p>W HEN Tughril Beg died (1063) he was succeeded as Seljuq sultan by
his nephew Alp Arslan, then twenty-six years of age. A well-disposed
Moslem historian describes him as</p>
<p>tall, with mustaches so long that he used to tie up their ends when
he wished to shoot; and never did his arrows miss the mark. He w’ore so
lofty a turban that men were wont to say that from its top to the end of
his mustaches was a distance of two yards. He was a strong and just
ruler, generally magnanimous, swift to punish tyranny or extortion</p>
<p>among his officials, and extremely charitable to the poor. He was
also devoted to the study of history, listening with great pleasure and
inter- est to chronicles of former kings, and to works that threw light
on</p>
<p>their characters, institutions, and methods of administration. 1</p>
<p>Despite these scholarly inclinations, Alp Arslan lived up to his name
— “the lion- hearted hero”— by conquering Herat, Armenia, Georgia, and
Syria. The Greek Emperor Romanus IV collected 100,000 varied and
ill-disciplined troops to meet Arslan’s 15,000 experienced v/arriors.
The Seljuq leader of- fered a reasonable peace; Romanus rejected it
scornfully, gave battle at Man- zikert in Armenia (1071), fought bravely
amid his cowardly troops, was defeated and captured, and was led before
the Sulta n. “What would have been your behavior,” asked Arslan, “had
fortune smiled upon your arms?” “I would have inflicted upon thy body
many a stripe,” answered Romanus. Arslan treated him with all courtesy,
released him on the promise of a royal ransom, and dismissed him with
rich gifts. 2 A year later Arslan died by an assassin’s knife.</p>
<p>His son Malik Shah (1072-92) was the greatest of the Seljuq sultans.
While his general Suleiman completed the conquest of Asia Minor, he him-
self took Transoxiana as far as Bokhara and Kashgar. His able and
devoted prime minister, Nizam al- Mulk, brought to this and Arslan’s
reign much of the brilliance and prosperity that the Barmakids had given
to Baghdad in the days of Harun al-Rashid. For thirty years Nizam
organized and controlled administration, policy, and finance, encouraged
industry and trade, im- proved roads, bridges, and inns, and made them
safe for all wayfarers. He</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 3O9</p>
<p>was a generous friend to artists, poets, scientists; raised splendid
buildings in Baghdad; founded and endowed a famous college there; and
directed and fi- nanced the erection of the Great Dome Chamber in the
Friday Mosque at Isfahan. It was apparently at his suggestion that Malik
Shah summoned Omar Khayyam and other astronomers to reform the Persian
calendar. An old tale tells how Nizam, Omar, and Hasan ibn al-Sabbah,
when schoolmates, vowed to share with one another any later good
fortune; like so many good stories it is probably a legend, for Nizam
was born in 1017, while both Omar and Hasan died in 1 123-4; an d there
is no indication that either of these was a centenarian. 3</p>
<p>At the age of seventy-five Nizam wrote down his philosophy of govern-
ment in one of the major works of Persian prose — the Siyasat-nama , or
Book of the Art of Rule . He strongly recommended religious orthodoxy in
people and king, considered no government secure without a religious
base, and de- duced from religion the divine right and authority of the
sultan. At the same time he did not spare his divine monarch some human
advice on the duties of a sovereign. A ruler must avoid excess in wine
and levity; must detect and punish official corruption or tyranny; and
must, twice a week, hold public audiences at which even the lowliest
subject may present petitions or griev- ances. Nizam was humane but
intolerant; he mourned that Christians, Jews, and Shi‘ites were employed
by the government, and he denounced the Is - mailite sect with especial
violence as threatening the unity of the state. In 1092 an Ismaili
devotee approached him in the guise of a suppliant, and stabbed him to
death.</p>
<p>The assassin was a member of the strangest sect in history. About
1090 an Ismaili leader — the same Hasan ibn al-Sabbah whom legend allied
with Omar and Nizam — seized the mountain fortress of Alamut (“Eagle’s
Nest”) in northern Persia, and from that stronghold, 10,000 feet above
the sea, waged a campaign of terror and murder against the opponents and
persecutors of the Ismaili faith. Nizam’s book charged the group with
being lineally de - scended from the communistic Mazdakites of Sasanian
Persia. It was a secret fraternity, with diverse grades of initiation,
and a Grand Master whom the Crusaders called the “Old Alan of the
Mountain.” The lowest degree of the order included the fidais, who were
required to obey, without hesitation or scruple, any of their leader’s
commands. According to Alarco Polo, who passed by Alamut in 1 27 1 , the
Master had arranged behind the fortress a gar- den peopled like the
Mohammedan paradise with “ladies and damsels who dallied with the men to
their hearts’ content.” The candidates for admission to the order were
given hashish to drink; when stupefied by it, they were brought into the
garden; and on recovering their senses they were told that they were in
paradise. After four or five days of wine, women, and good food, they
were again drugged with hashish, and were carried from the gar- den.
Waking, they asked for the lost paradise, and were told that they
would</p>
<p>3!° THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>be readmitted to it, and forever, if they should obey the Master
faithfully, or be slain in his service. 4 The youths who complied were
called hashshasheen, drinkers of hashish — whence the word assassin.
Hasan ruled Alamut for thirty-five years, and made it a center of
assassination, education, and art. The organization long survived him;
it seized other strongholds, fought the Crusaders, and (it is alleged)
killed Conrad of Montferrat at the behest of Richard Coeur de Lion. 5 In
1256 the Mongols under Hulagu captured Alamut and other Assassin
centers; thereafter the members of the order were hunted and slain as
nihilist enemies of society. Nevertheless it continued as a religious
sect, and became in time peaceable and respectable; its zealous ad-
herents in India, Persia, Syria, and Africa acknowledge the Agha Khan as
their head, and yearly pay him a tenth of their revenues. 6</p>
<p>Malik Shah died a month after his vizier. His sons fought a war of
succes- sion, and in the ensuing chaos no united Moslem resistance was
offered to the Crusades. Sultan Sinjar at Baghdad restored the Seljuq
splendor for a reign (1 117-57), and literature prospered under his
patronage; but after his death the Seljuq realm disintegrated into
independent principalities of petty dynasties and warring kings. At
Mosul one of Malik Shah’s Kurd slaves, Zangi, founded in 1 1 27 the
Atabeg (“Father of the Prince”) dynasty, which fought the Crusaders
zealously, and extended its rule over Mesopotamia. Zangi’s son Nur
-ud-din Mahmud (1146-73) conquered Syria, made Damas- cus his capital,
ruled with justice and diligence, and plucked Egypt from the dying
Fatimids.</p>
<p>The same decadence that had subjected the Abbasids to Buwayhid and
Seljuq domination had, two centuries later, debased the caliphs of Cairo
to the role of Shia priests in a state actually ruled by their soldier
viziers. Im- mersed in a numerous harem, hedged in by eunuchs and
slaves, emasculated by comfort and concubines, the Fatimids allowed
their prime ministers to take the title of kings, and to dispense at
will the offices and perquisites of government. In 1164 two candidates
competed for this royal vizierate. One of them, Shawar, asked the help
of Nur-ud-din, who sent him a small force under Shirkuh. Shirkuh slew
Shawar, and made himself vizier. When Shir- kuh died ( 1 1 69) he was
succeeded by his nephew al-Malik al-Nasir Salah- ed-din Yusuf ibn Ayyub
— i.e., the King, the Defender, the Honor of the Faith, Joseph, son of
Job — known to us as Saladin.</p>
<p>He was born (1138) at Tekrit on the upper Tigris, of Kurd —
non-Semitic — stock. His father Ayyub rose to be governor first of
Baalbek under Zangi, then of Damascus under Nur-ud-din. Saladin, brought
up in those cities and courts, learned well the arts of statesmanship
and war. But with these he com- bined orthodox piety, a zealous study of
theology, and an almost ascetic sim- plicity of life; the Moslems number
him among their greatest saints. His chief garment was a coarse woolen
cloth, his only drink was water, and his sexual temperance (after some
early indulgence) aroused all but the emula-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 3 1 1</p>
<p>tion of his contemporaries. Sent with Shirkuh to Egypt, he gave so
good an account of himself as a soldier that he was put in command over
Alexandria, which he successfully defended against the Franks (1167).
Made vizier at thirty, he devoted himself to restoring orthodox
Mohammedanism in Egypt. In 1 17 1 he had the name of the ShiaFatimid
caliph replaced in the public prayers by that of the Abbasid caliph —
now merely the orthodox pontiff of Baghdad. Al-Adid, last of the
Fatimids, was at the time ill in his palace, and did not notice this
ecclesiastical revolution; Saladin kept him fully unin- formed, so that
the wastrel “might die in peace.” This the Caliph did pres - ently, and
as no successor was appointed, the Fatimid dynasty came to a quiet end.
Saladin made himself governor instead of vizier, and acknowledged
Nur-ud-din as his sovereign. When he entered the caliphal palace at
Cairo he found there 12,000 occupants, all women except the male
relatives of the Caliph; and such wealth in jewelry, furniture, ivory,
porcelain, glass, and other objects of art as could hardly be rivaled by
any other dignitary of that era. Saladin kept nothing of all this for
himself, gave the palace to his captains, and continued to live, in the
vizier’s chambers, a life of fortunate simplicity.</p>
<p>On Nur-ud- din ’s death (1173) the provincial governors refused to ac
- knowledge his eleven-year-old son as king, and Syria verged again on
chaos. Alleging fear that the Crusaders would take the country, Saladin
left Egypt with a force of 700 horsemen, and in swift campaigns made
himself master of Syria. Returning to Egypt, he took the title of king,
and thereby inaugurated the Ayyubid dynasty (1175). Six years later he
set out again, made Damascus his capital, and conquered Mesopotamia.
There, as at Cairo, he continued to display the stern orthodoxy of his
faith. He built several mosques, hospitals, monasteries, and madrasas or
theological schools. He encouraged architec- ture, discountenanced
secular science, and shared Plato’s disdain for poetry. All wrongs that
came to his knowledge were speedily redressed; and taxes were lowered at
the same time that public works were extended and the functions of
government were carried on with efficiency and zeal. Islam gloried in
the integrity and justice of his rule, and Christendom acknowl- edged in
him an infidel gentleman.</p>
<p>We shall not detail the medley of local dynasties that divided
Eastern Islam after his death (1193). His sons lacked his ability, and
the Ayyubid rule in Syria ended in three generations (1260). In Egypt it
flourished till 1250, and reached its zenith under the enlightened Malik
al-Kamil</p>
<p>(1218-38), friend of Frederick II. In Asia Minor the Seljuqs
established (1077- 1327) the sultanate of “Rum” (Rome), and for a time
made Konya (St. Paul’s Iconium) the center of a lettered civilization.
Asia Minor, which had been half Greek since Homer, was now
de-Hellenized, and became as Turkish as Turkestan; there, today, Turkey
holds its precarious seat in a once Hittite capital. An independent
tribe of Turks ruled Khwarizm ( 1077-</p>
<p>1231), and extended its power from the Urals to the Persian Gulf. It
was in</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>this condition of political atomism that Jenghiz Khan found Asiatic
Islam.</p>
<p>Yet even in these declining years Islam led the world in poetry,
science, and philosophy, and rivaled the Hohenstaufens in government.
The Seljuq sultans — Tughril Beg, Alp Arslan, Malik Shah, Sinjar — were
among the ablest monarchs of the Middle Ages; Nizam al-Mulk ranks with
the greatest statesmen; Nur-ud-din, Saladin, and al-Kamil were the
equals of Richard I, Louis IX, and Frederick II. All these Moslem
rulers, and even the minor kings, continued the Abbasid support of
literature and art; at their courts we sh all find poets like Omar,
Nizami, Sa‘di, and Jalal ud -din Rumi; and though philosophy faded out
under their cautious orthodoxy, architecture flourished more splendidly
than before. The Seljuqs and Saladin persecuted Moslem heresy; but they
were so lenient to Christians and Jews that Byzan- tine historians told
of Christian communities inviting Seljuq rulers to come and oust
oppressive Byzantine governors. 7 Under the leadership of the Sel- juqs
and Ayyubids Western Asia again prospered in body and mind. Da- mascus,
Aleppo, Mosul, Baghdad, Isfahan, Rayy, Herat, Amida, Nishapur, and Merv
were in this period among the best adorned and most cultured cities in
the white man’s world. It was a brilliant decay.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ISLAMIC WEST: 1086-1300</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1 249 al-Salih, last Egyptian sultan of the Ayyubid line, passed
away. His widow and former slave, Shajar-al-Durr, connived at the murder
of her stepson, and proclaimed herself queen. To save their masculine
honor, the Moslem leaders of Cairo chose another former slave, Aybak, as
her associ- ate. She married him, but continued to rule; and when he
attempted a decla- ration of independence she had him murdered in his
bath (1257). She herself was presently battered to death with wooden
shoes by Aybak’s women slaves.</p>
<p>Aybak had lived long enough to found the Mamluk dynasty. Mamluk meant
“owned,” and was applied to white slaves, usually strong and fear - less
Turks or Mongols employed as palace guards by the Ayyubid sultans. As in
Rome and Baghdad, so in Cairo the guards became the kings. For 267 years
(1250-1517) the Mamluks ruled Egypt, and sometimes Syria (127 1 —</p>
<p>1516); they incarnadined their capital with assassinations, and
beautified it with art; their courage saved Syria and Egypt — even
Europe — when they routed the Mongols at Ain-Jalut (1260). They received
less wide acclaim for saving Palestine from the Franks, and driving the
last Christian warrior from Asia.</p>
<p>The greatest and least scrupulous of the Mamluk rulers was al-Malik
Bai- bars (1260-77). Born a Turkish slave, his brave resourcefulness
raised him to high command in the Egyptian army. It was he who defeated
Louis I</p>
<p>XCHAP.XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 3 1 3</p>
<p>at Mansura in 1250; and ten years later he fought with fierce skill
under the Sultan Qutuz at Ain-Jalut. He murdered Qutuz on the way back
to Cairo, made himself sultan, and accepted with winning grace the
triumph that the city had prepared for his victorious victim. He renewed
repeatedly the war against the Crusaders, always with success; and for
these holy campaigns Moslem tradition honors him next to Harun and
Saladin. In peace, says a contemporary Christian chronicler, he was
“sober, chaste, just to his people, even kind to his Christian
subjects.” 8 He organized the government of Egypt so well that no
incompetence among his successors availed to unseat the Mamluks till
their overthrow by the Ottoman Turks in 1 5 1 7. He gave Egypt a strong
army and navy, cleared its harbors, roads, and canals, and built the
mosque that bears his name.</p>
<p>Another Turkish slave deposed Baibars’ son, and became Sultan al
-Mansur Sayf-al-Din Qalaun ( 1 279-90) . History remembers him chiefly
for the great hospital that he built at Cairo, and which he endowed with
an annuity of a million dirhems (00,000). His son Nasir (1293-1340) was
thrice en- throned but only twice deposed; built aqueducts, public
baths, schools, monasteries, and thirty mosques; dug with the forced
labor of 100,000 men a canal connecting Alexandria with the Nile; and
exemplified Mamluk ways by slaughtering 20,000 animals for the marriage
feast of his son. When Nasir traveled through the desert forty camels
bore on their backs a garden of rich earth to provide him with fresh
vegetables every day. 9 He depleted the treasury, and condemned his
successors to a slow decline of the Mamluk power.</p>
<p>These sultans do not impress us as favorably as the Seljuqs or
Ayyubids. They undertook great public works, but most of these were
accomplished by peasants and proletaires exploited to the limit of human
tolerance, and for a government completely irresponsible to either the
nation or an aristoc- racy; assassination was the only known form of
recall. At the same time these brutal rulers had good taste and a large
spirit in literature and art. The Mamluk period is the most brilliant in
the history of medieval Egyptian architecture. Cairo was now ( 1 250-1
300) the richest city west of the Indus. 10 Markets teeming with all the
necessaries and many of the superfluities of life; the great slave mart
where one could buy and sell men and maidens; little shops nestling in
the walls, and crowded with goods of flexible price; alleys crawling
with men and beasts, noisy with pedlars and carts, deliberately narrow
for shade and crooked for defense; homes hidden behind stem fagades,
rooms dark and cool amid the glare and heat and bustle of the streets,
and breathing from an inner court or garden close; interiors lushly
furnished with hangings, carpets, embroideries, and works of art; men
chewing hashish to produce a dreamy intoxication; women gossiping in the
zenana, or furtively flirting in a window bay; music strummed from a
thou- sand lutes, and weird concerts in the Citadel; public parks
redolent with</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>3H</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>flowers and picnicking; canals and the great river dotted with cargo
barges, passenger vessels, and pleasure boats: this was the Cairo of
medieval Islam. One of its poets sang:</p>
<p>Beside that garden flowed the placid Nile.</p>
<p>Oft have I steered my dahabiya there;</p>
<p>Oft have I landed to repose awhile,</p>
<p>And bask and revel in the sunny smile</p>
<p>Of her whose presence made the place so fair. 11</p>
<p>Meanwhile in North Africa a succession of dynasties had their day.
Zayrids (972-1148) and Hafsids (1228-1534) ruled Tunisia; Hammadids
(1007-</p>
<ol start="1152" type="1">
<li><p>governed Algeria; Almoravids (1056-1147) and Almohads
(1130-</p></li>
<li><p>held sway in Morocco. In Spain the victorious Almoravids, once
the frugal warriors of Africa, rapidly learned the luxurious ways of the
Cor- dovan and Sevillian princes whom they had replaced. The discipline
of war gave way to the blandishments of peace; courage yielded to money
as the standard of excellence and the goal of desire; women won by their
grace and charms a power rivaled only by theologians promising like joys
in para- dise. Officials became corrupt, and administration, which had
been compe- tent under Yusuf ibn Tashfin (1090-1106), was already
debased under Ali his son (1106-43). As governmental negligence grew,
brigandage spread; roads became unsafe; commerce languished, wealth
declined. The kings of Catholic Spain seized their opportunity, and
raided Cordova, Seville, and other cities of Moorish Spain. Again the
Moslems turned to Africa for deliverance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There, in 1 1 2 1 , a religious revolution had raised a new sect to
power and violence. Abdallah ibn Tumart denounced both the
anthropomorphism of the orthodox and the rationalism of the
philosophers; he demanded a return to simplicity of life and creed; and
ended by proclaiming himself the Mahdi or Messiah promised in the Shia
faith. The barbarous tribes of the Atlas range flocked to him, organized
themselves under the name of Almohads or Unitarians, overthrew the
Almoravid rulers in Morocco, and found it an easy matter to do the like
in Spain. Under the Almohad emirs Abd al-Mumin (1145-63) and Abu Yaqub
Yusuf (1163-84) order and prosperity returned to Andalusia and Morocco;
literature and learning once more raised their heads; and philosophers
were protected on the quiet understanding that they would make their
works unintelligible. But Abu Yusuf Yaqub (1184-99) yielded to the
theologians, forsook philosophy, and ordered all philosoph- ical works
to be burned. His son Muhammad al-Nasir (1 199-12 14) cared for neither
philosophy nor religion; he neglected government, specialized in
pleasure, and was overwhelmingly defeated by the united armies of Chris-

Moors retired to Granada, where the Sierra Nevada, or Snowy Ridge,
provided some defense; and well-rivered fields flowered into vineyards,
olive orchards, and orange groves. A succession of prudent rulers
sustained Granada and its dependencies — Xeres, Jaen, Almeria, and
Malaga — against repeated Chris- tian assaults; commerce and industry
revived, art flourished, the people gained renown for their gay dress
and joyous fetes; and the little kingdom survived till 1492 as the last
European foothold of a culture that had made Andalusia for many
centuries an honor to mankind.</p>

<li>GLIMPSES OF ISLAMIC ART: IO58-125O</li>
</ol>
<p>It was in this age of Berber domination that Moslem Spain raised the
Al- hambra at Granada and the Alcazar and Giralda at Seville. The new
archi- tectural style is often called Morisco, as having entered from
Morocco; but its elements came from Syria and Persia, and mark as well
the Taj Mahal in India; so wide and rich was the realm of Moslem art. It
was a feminine style, aiming no longer at impressive strength as in the
mosques of Damascus, Cordova, and Cairo, but at a delicate beauty in
which all skill seemed ab- sorbed in decoration, and the sculptor
engulfed the architect.</p>
<p>The Almohads were enthusiastic builders. First they built for
defense, and surrounded their major cities with mighty walls and towers,
like the Torre del Oro, or Tower of Gold, that guarded the Guadalquivir
at Seville. The Alcazar there was a union of fortress and palace, and
showed a plain, blunt front to the world. Designed by the Toledan
architect Jalubi for Abu Yaqub Yusuf (1181), it became after 1248 the
favorite domicile of the Christian kings; it was modified, repaired,
restored, or enlarged by Pedro I (1353), Charles V (1526) … and Isabella
( 1 8 3 3 ) ; it is now predominantly Christian in origin but
predominantly Moorish — or Christian Moorish (“Mudejar”)— in workmanship
and style.</p>
<p>The same Abu Yaqub Yusuf who began the Alcazar built in 1171 the</p>
<p>great mosque of Seville, of which nothing remains. In 1196 the
architect Jabir raised the magnificent minaret of the mosque, known to
us as the Giralda. The conquering Christians transformed the mosque into
a church ( 1 235) ; in 1401 this was torn down, and on its site — partly
with its materials — was erected the vast cathedral of Seville. Of the
Giralda the lowest 230 feet are of the original structure, the remaining
82 are a Christian supple- ment ( 1 568) completely harmonious with the
Moorish base. The upper two thirds are richly ornamented with arcaded
balconies and lace-like trellises of stucco and stone. At the top is a
powerful bronze figure of Faith (1568), which hardly symbolizes the
ever-religious mood of Spain by turning with the winds; hence the
Spanish name Giralda — that which turns ( gira ) . Towers</p>
<p>3 I &lt;5 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>almost as beautiful were raised by the Moors at Marraqesh (1069) and
Rabat (1197).</p>
<p>At Granada, in 1248, Muhammad ibn al-Ahmar (1232-73) ordered the
erection of Spain’s most famous edifice, the Alhambra— i.e., “the red.”
The chosen site was a mountain crag bounded by deep ravines, and looking
down upon two rivers, the Darro and the Genii. The emir found there a
fortress, the Alcazaba, dating from the ninth century; he added to it,
built the great outer walls of the Alhambra and the earlier of its
palaces, and left every- where his modest motto: “There is no conqueror
but Allah.” The immense structure has been repeatedly extended and
repaired, by Christians as well as Moors. Charles V added his own palace
in square Renaissance style, solemn, incongruous, and incomplete.
Following the principles of military architecture as developed in
Eastern Islam, the unknown architect designed the enclosure first as a
fortress capable of holding 40,000 men. 12 The more luxurious taste of
the next two centuries gradually transformed this fortress into a
congeries of halls and palaces, nearly all distinguished by unsurpassed
delicacy of floral or geometrical decoration, carved or stamped in
colored stucco, brick, or stone. In the Court of the Myrtles a pool
reflects the foli- age and the fretted portico. Behind it rises the
battlemented Tower of Co- mares, where the besieged thought to find a
last and impregnable redoubt. Within the tower is the ornate Hall of the
Ambassadors; here the emirs of Granada sat enthroned, while foreign
emissaries marveled at the art and wealth of the tiny kingdom; here
Charles V, looking out from a balcony window upon the gardens, groves,
and stream below, mused,- “How ill -fated the man who lost all this!” 13
In the main courtyard, th e Patio de los Leones, a dozen ungainly marble
lions guard a majestic alabaster fountain; the slen- der columns and
flowered capitals of the surrounding arcade, the stalactite archivolts,
the Kufic lettering, the time-subdued tints of the filigree ara-
besques, make this the masterpiece of the Morisco style. Perhaps in
their enthusiasm and their luxury the Moors here pressed their art
beyond ele- gance to excess; where all is ornament the eye and soul grow
weary even of beauty and skill. This delicacy of decoration leaves a
sense of frailty, and sacrifices that impression of secure strength
which architecture should con- vey. And yet nearly all this frosting has
survived a dozen earthquakes; the ceiling of the Hall of the Ambassadors
fell, but the rest remained. In sum this picturesque ensemble of
gardens, palaces, fountains, and balconies sug- gests both the climax
and the decay of Moorish art in Spain: a wealth gone to extravagance, a
conquering energy relaxed into a flair for ease, a taste for beauty that
has subsided from power and grandeur to elegance and grace.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century Moorish art flowed back from Spain into North
Africa, and Marraqesh, Fez, Tlemcen, Tunis, Sfax, and Tripoli reached
the apogee of their splendor with handsome palaces, dazzling mosques,
and labyrinthine slums. In Egypt and the East a new virility was brought
into Islamic art by the Seljuqs,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 317</p>
<p>the Ayyubids, and the Mamluks. Southeast of Cairo Saladin and his
successors, using the forced labor of captured Crusaders, raised the
immense Citadel, prob- ably in imitation of the castles built by the
Franks in Syria. At Aleppo the Ayyubids reared the Great Mosque and
Citadel, and at Damascus the mausoleum of Saladin. Meanwhile an
architectural revolution transformed the old courtyard style of mosque
into the madrasa or collegiate mosque throughout Eastern Islam. As
mosques increased .in number, it was no longer necessary to design them
with a large central court to hold a numerous congregation; and the
rising demand for schools required new educational facilities. From the
mosque proper — now almost always crowned with a dominating dome — four
wings or transepts spread, each with its own minarets, a richly
decorated portal, and a spacious lec- ture hall. Normally each of the
four orthodox schools of theology and law had its own wing; as an honest
sultan said, it was desirable to support all four schools, so that at
least one would in any case be found to justify the actions of the gov-
ernment. This revolution in design was continued by the Mamluks in
mosques and tombs firmly built in stone, guarded with massive doors of
damascened bronze, lighted by windows of stained glass, and brilliant
with mosaics, carvings in colored stucco, and such enduring tiles as
only Islam knew how to make.</p>
<p>Of Seljuq architectural monuments not one in a hundred has survived.
In Armenia the mosque of Ani; at Konya the magnificent portal of the
mosque of Diwrigi, the immense mosque of Ala-ud-din, the cavernous porch
and em- broiderylike fagade of the Sirtjeli madrasa; in Mesopotamia the
Great Mosque of Mosul, and the mosque of Mustansir at Baghdad; in Persia
the tower of Tughril Beg at Rayy, the tomb of Sinjar at Merv, the
dazzling mihrab of the Alaviyan Mosque at Hamadan, the ribbed vault and
unique squinches of the Fri- day Mosque at Qasvin, and there, too, the
great arches and mihrab of the Hayda- ria Mosque: these are but a few of
the structures that remain to prove the skill of Seljuq architects and
the taste of Seljuq kings. But more beautiful than any of these —
rivaled in Persia only by the later Tomb of Imam Riza at Mashhad — is
the masterpiece of the Seljuq age, the Masjid-i-Jami, or Friday Mosque,
of Isfahan. Like Chartres or Notre Dame, it bears the labor and stamp or
many centuries; begun in 1088, it was several times restored or
enlarged, and reached its present form only in 1612. But the larger of
the great brick domes carries the inscription of Nizam al-Mulk, and the
date 1088. The porch and the sanctuary portals — one eighty feet high —
are adorned with mosaic faience hardly rivaled in all the history of
that art. The inner halls are roofed with ribbed vaults, complex
squinches, and pointed arches springing from massive piers. The mihrab
(1310) has a stucco relief of vine and lotus foliage, and Kufic
lettering, unsurpassed in Islam.</p>
<p>Such monuments laugh out of court the notion that the Turks were
barbarians. Just as the Seljuq rulers and viziers were among the most
capable statesmen in history, so the Seljuq architects were among the
most competent and courageous builders of an Age of Faith distinguished
by massive and audacious designs. The Persian flair for ornament was
checked by the heroic mold of the Seljuq style; and the union of the two
moods brought an architectural outburst in Asia Minor, Iraq, and Iran,
strangely contemporary with the Gothic flowering in France. In- stead of
hiding the mosque in a corner of a court, as the Arabs had done, the</p>
<p>3 1 8 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>Seljuqs gave it a bold and brilliant fagade, raised its height, and
led it up to a circular or conical dome that brought all the edifice
into unity. The pointed arch, the vault, and the dome were now perfectly
combined. 14</p>
<p>All the arts reached their Moslem zenith in this strange age of
grandeur and de- cay. Pottery seemed to the- Persians an indispensable
amenity of life; and seldom has the ceramic art reached so heterogeneous
an excellence. 15 The techniques of luster decoration, of monochrome or
polychrome painting over or under glaze, of enamel, tile, faience, and
glass, now perfected their Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Sasanian, and Syrian
heritage. Chinese influence entered, especially in the paint- ing of
figures, but it did not dominate the Persian style. Porcelain was
imported from China; but the scarcity of kaolin in the Near and Middle
East discouraged the Moslem manufacture of this translucent ware.
Nevertheless, during the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries
Persian pottery remained unrivaled — superior in variety of forms,
elegance of proportions, brilliance of decoration, grace and delicacy of
line. 16</p>
<p>In general the minor arts in Islam hardly deserved so slighting a
name. Aleppo and Damascus in this period produced frail marvels of glass
with enamel designs, and Cairo made for mosques and palaces enameled
glass lamps which are among the prizes of art collectors today.* The
Fatimid treasury dispersed by Saladin contained thousands of crystal or
sardonyx vases whose artistry seems beyond our skill today. The old
Assyrian art of metalwork reached now an unprecedented height in Syria
and Egypt, whence it passed to Venice in the fifteenth century. 18
Copper, bronze, brass, silver, gold were cast or beaten into utensils,
weapons, arms, lamps, ewers, basins, bowls, trays, mirrors, astronomical
instruments, flower vases, chandeliers, pen boxes, inkstands, braziers,
perfume burners, animal figures, Koran cases, andirons, keys, scissors .
. . delicately engraved, and in many instances inlaid with precious
metals or stones. Brass table tops were incised with super- abundant
designs, and magnificent metal grilles were made for sanctuaries, doors,
or tombs. A silver salver engraved with ibexes, geese, and the name of
Alp Arslan, and dated 1066, now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, has
been judged “the outstanding silver piece of the Islamic period” of
Persian art* “and the most im - portant single object surviving from
Seljuq times .” 19</p>
<p>Sculpture remained a dependent art, confined to reliefs and carvings
of stone or stucco, to ornamental scripts and arabesques; a reckless
ruler might have a statue made of himself or his wife or a singing girl,
but such figures were secret sins, rarely exposed to public gaze. Wood
carving, however, flourished. Doors, pulpits, mihrabs, lecterns,
screens, ceilings, tables, lattice windows, cabinets, boxes, combs were
cut in lacelike designs, or were laboriously rounded by cross- legged
turners revolving their lathes with a bow. A still more incredible
patience produced silks, satins, brocades, embroideries, gold-woven
velvets, hangings, tents, and rugs of such delicate weave or fascinating
design as set the world won- deringly envious. Marco P olo, visiting
Asia Minor about 1270, noted there “the most beautiful rugs in the
world.” 20 John Singer Sargent thought a certain Per - sian rug “worth
all the pictures ever painted”; 21 yet expert opinion judges extant
Persian carpets to be imperfect examples of an art in which Persia has

<p>turies led the world. Only tattered fragments remain of Iranian rugs
from the Seljuq age, but we may surmise their excellence from their
representation in the miniatures of the Mongol period.</p>
<p>Painting in Islam was a major art in miniatures, and an ever less
minor art in murals and portraiture. The Fatimid Caliph Amir (1 101-30)
engaged artists to paint in his rooms at Cairo the portraits of
contemporary poets; 22 apparently the old prohibition of “graven images”
was weakening. Seljuq painting reached its height in Transoxiana, where
Sunnite prejudices against representation was di- luted by distance; and
Turkish manuscripts picture their heroes abundantly. No certainly Seljuq
miniature has reached us, but the heyday of the art in the ensu- ing
Mongol period of Eastern Islam leaves little doubt of its flourishing in
Seljuq times. Subtle minds and hands made ever lovelier Korans for
Seljuq, Ayyubid, or Mamluk mosques, monasteries, dignitaries, and
schools, and engraved upon the leather or lacquer bindings designs as
delicate as a spider’s web. Rich men - sian poet, “cannot grasp the joy
that reason draws from a fine - drawn line.” 23</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE AGE OF OMAR KHAYYAM: IO38-II22</li>
</ol>
<p>The artists of this age were apparently equaled in number by the
poets and savants. Cairo, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Baalbek, Aleppo,
Damascus, Mosul, Emesa, Tus, Nishapur, and many other cities boasted
colleges; Bagh- dad alone had thirty in 1064. A year later Nizam al-Mulk
added another, the Nizamiya; in 1234 the Caliph Mustansir founded still
another, which in size, architecture, and equipment surpassed all the
rest; one traveler called it the most beautiful building in the city. It
contained four distinct law schools, in which qualified students
received free tuition, food, and med- ical care, and a monthly gold
dinar for other expenses; it contained a hos- pital, a bathhouse, and a
library freely open to students and staff. Women probably attended
college in some cases, for we hear of a shaikha — a lady professor —
whose lectures, like Aspa sia’s or Hypatia’s, drew large audiences ( c .
1 1 78). 24 Libraries were now richer and more numerous than ever in
Islam; Moslem Spain alone had seventy public libraries. Grammarians,
lexi- cographers, encyclopedists, and historians continued to flourish.
Collective biography was a Moslem hobby and forte: Ibn al-Qifti
(d. 1248) wrote the lives of 414 philosophers and scientists; Ibn Abi
Usaybia (1203-70) per- formed a like service for 400 physicians;
Muhammad Awfi (1228) achieved an encyclopedia of 300 Persian poets
without mentioning Omar Khayyam;</p>
<p>320 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>and Muhammad ibn Khallikan (1211-82) surpassed all other singlehanded
works of this kind in his Obituaries of Men of Note , containing brief
anec- dotal lives of 865 distinguished Mohammedans. It is remarkably
accurate for a book covering so wide a field; Ibn Khallikan nevertheless
apologized for its imperfections, saying, in its final words, that “God
has allowed no book to be faultless except the Koran.” Muhammad
al-Shahrastani, in a Book of Religions and. Sects (1128), analyzed the
leading faiths and phi- losophies of the world, and summarized their
history; no contemporary Christian could have written so learned and
impartial a work.</p>
<p>Moslem fiction never rose above the episodic picaresque proliferation
of tales unified only by the persistence of a single character. After
the Koran, the Thousand Nights and a Night, and the fables of Bidpai,
the most popular book in Islam was the Maqamat ( Discourses ) of Abu
Muhammad al-Hariri (1 054-1 122) of Basra. Here, in rhymed Arabic prose,
are the ad- ventures of the charming scoundrel Abu Zaid, who wins
forgiveness for his pranks, crimes, and blasphemies by his genial humor,
resourceful clever- ness, and tempting philosophy:</p>
<p>Obey not the fool who forbids thee to pull beauty’s rose when in</p>
<p>full bloom thou’rt free to possess’it; pursue thine end still, though
it seem past thy skill; let them say what they will; take thy pleasure
and bless it! 25</p>
<p>Nearly every literate Moslem now wrote poetry, and nearly every ruler
encouraged it. If we may take the word of Ibn Khaldun, hundreds of poets
could be found at the Almoravid and Almohad courts in Africa and Spain.
20 At a gathering of rival poets in Seville, el-Aama et-Toteli (i.e.,
the Blind Poet of Tudela) won the prize with lines that sum up half the
poetry of the world:</p>
<p>When she laughs, pearls appear; when she removes her veil, the moon
is-seen;</p>
<p>The universe is too narrow to contain her; yet she is enclosed in my
heart. 27</p>
<p>The other poets, we are told, tore up their verses unread. In Cairo
Zuheyr sang of love long after his hair was white. In Eastern Islam the
breakup of the Empire into small kingdoms increased the number and
rivalry of patrons, and helped literature, as in nineteenth-century
Germany. Persia was the richest of the nations in her poets. Anwari of
Khurasan (fl. 1185) rhymed for a time at the court of Sinjar, whom he
praised only next to himself.</p>
<p>I have a soul ardent as fire, a tongue fluent as water,</p>
<p>A mind sharpened by intelligence, and verse devoid of flaw.</p>
<p>Alas! there is no patron worthy of my eulogies!</p>
<p>Alas! there is.no sweetheart worthy of my odes! 28</p>
<p>Quite as confident was his contemporary Khagani (1106-85), whose
arrogance provoked his tutor to a genealogical barb:</p>
<p>3 2 1</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM</p>
<p>My dear Khagani, skillful though you be</p>
<p>In verse, one little hint I give you free:</p>
<p>Mock not with satire any older poet;</p>
<p>Perhaps he’s your sire, though you don’t know it. 29</p>
<p>Europe knows Persian poetry chiefly through Omar Khayyam; Persia
classes him among her scientists, and considers his quatrains the casual
amuse- ment of “one of the greatest mathematicians of medieval times.”
30 Abu’l - Fath Umar Khayyami ibn Ibrahim was born at Nishapur in 1038.
His</p>
<p>cognomen meant tentmaker, but proves nothing about his trade or that
of his father Abraham; occupational names, in Omar’s time, had lost
their lit - eral application, as among the Smiths, Taylors, Bakers, and
Porters of our land. History knows little of his life, but records
several of his works. His Algebra , translated into French in 1857, made
significant advances both on al-Khwarizmi and on the Greeks; its partial
solution of cubic equations has been judged “perhaps the very highest
peak of medieval mathematics.” 31 Another of his works on algebra (a
manuscript in the Leiden Library) studied critically the postulates and
definitions of Euclid. In 1074 the Sultan Malik Shah commissioned him
and others to reform the Persian calendar. The outcome was a calendar
that required a day’s correction every 3770 years — slightly more
accurate than ours, which requires a day’s correction</p>
<p>In the winter of a.h. 508 〔a.d. i i 14-5〕 the King sent a messenger
to</p>
<p>Merv bidding its governor tell Umar al-Khayyami to select a
favor-</p>
<p>able time for him to go hunting. . . . Umar looked into the matter
for two days, made a careful choice of the desirable time, and
himself</p>
<p>went to superintend the mounting of the King. When the King had</p>
<p>gone a short distance the sky became overcast, a wind rose, and snow
and mist supervened. All present fell to laughing, and the King wished
to turn back. But Umar said, “Ha ve no anxiety, for this very hour</p>
<p>the clouds will clear away, and during these five days there will
be</p>
<p>no drop of moisture.” So the King rode on, and the clouds opened,</p>
<p>and during those five days there was no wet, and no cloud was</p>
<p>seen. 33</p>
<p>The rubaiyah or quatrain (from rubai , composed of four) is in its
Persian form a poem of four lines rhyming aaba . It is an epigram in the
Greek sense, as the expression of a completed thought in terse poetic
form. Its origin is unknown, but it long antedated Omar. In Persian
literature it is never part of a longer poem, but forms an independent
whole, hence Persian collectors</p>
<p>322 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>of rubaiyat arrange them not by their thought sequence but in the
alpha- betical order of the final letter of the rhyming syllables. 34
Thousands of Persian quatrains exist, mostly of uncertain authorship;
over 1 200 of them have been attributed to Omar, but often questionably.
The oldest Persian manuscript of the Rubaiyat of Omar (in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford) goes back only to 1460, and contains 158 stanzas,
alphabetically arranged. 85 Several of these have been traced to Omar’s
predecessors — some to Abu Said, one to Avicenna; 37 it is hardly
possible, save in a few cases, to assert positively that Omar wrote any
particular one of the quatrains ascribed to him. 38</p>
<p>The German Orientalist Von Hammer, in 1818, was the first European to
call attention to Omar’s rubaiyat. In 1859 Edward FitzGerald translated
seventy-five of them into English verse of a unique and pithy
excellence. The first edition, though its price was a penny, found few
purchasers; persistent and enlarged reissues, however, succeeded in
transforming the Persian mathematician into one of the most widely read
poets in the world. Of the 1 10 quatrains translated by FitzGerald
forty-nine — in the judgment of those familiar with the original — are
faithful paraphrases of single quatrains in the Persian text; forty-four
are composites, each taking something from two or more quatrains; two
“reflect the whole spirit of the original poem”; six are from quatrains
sometimes included in Omar’s text, but probably not his; two were
influenced by FitzGerald’s reading of Hafiz; three have no source in any
extant text of Omar, were apparently fathered by FitzGerald, and were
suppressed by him in his second edition. 39 Of stanza lxxxi —</p>
<p>O Thou, who man of baser earth didst make,</p>
<p>And e’en with Paradise devise the snake,</p>
<p>For all the sin wherewith the face of man</p>
<p>Is blackened, man ’s forgiveness give— and take! —</p>
<p>no corresponding passage can be found in Omar. 40 For the rest a
compar- ison of FitzGerald’s version with a literal translation of the
Persian text</p>
<p>CHAP. Xiv; GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 323</p>
<p>but the Sufi Najmud-din-Razi denounced him as the arch freethinker of
his time . 41</p>
<p>Influenced perhaps by science, perhaps by the poems of al- Ma’arri,
Omar rejected theology with patient scorn, and boasted of stealing
prayer rugs from the mosque . 42 He accepted the fatalism of the Moslem
creed, and, shorn of hope for an afterlife, fell into a pessimism that
sought consolation in study and wine. Stanzas cxxxii-iii of the Bodleian
manuscript raise intoxi- cation almost to a world philosophy:</p>
<p>’Tis I who have swept with my mustaches the wineshop,</p>
<p>To what is good and ill of both worlds said good-bye.</p>
<p>Should both worlds fall like a polo ball into the street,</p>
<p>You shall seek me out. A-sleeping like a drunkard I shall be. . .
.</p>
<p>From all that is, save wine, to refrain is well. . . .</p>
<p>To be inebriate, squalid, and vagrant is well.</p>
<p>One draught of wine is well from Moon to Fish 43 —</p>
<p>that is, from one end of the sky to the other. But when we note how
many Persian poets chant similar eulogies to unconsciousness, we wonder
is not this Bacchic piety a pose and literary form, like Horace’s
ambigendrous loves?</p>
<p>Probably such incidental quatra ins give a false impression of Omar’s
life; they doubtless played a minor role in his eighty-five years. We
should pic- ture him not as a drunkard sprawling in the street, but as
an old savant quietly content with cubic equations, a few constellations
and astronomic charts, and an occasional cup with fellow scholars “star
-scattered on the grass.” He seems to have loved flowers with the
passion of a people bound to a parched terrain; and if we trust
Nizami-i-Arudi, he was granted his wish to lie where flowers
bloomed.</p>
<p>In the year a.ii. 506 〔a.d. 1112-3〕 Umar Khayyami and Muzaffar-</p>
<p>i-Isfizari had alighted in the city of Balkh … in the house of Emir
Abu Sa’d, and I had joined that assembly. In this friendly gathering I
heard that Proof of the Trut h (Omar) say, “My grave will be in a
spot</p>
<p>where trees will shed their blossoms on me twice a year.” This seemed
to me impossible, though I knew that one such as he would not speak idle
words.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Nishapur in the year 530 〔1135〕, it being
then</p>
<p>some thirteen years since that great man had veiled his countenance
in the dust … I went to visit his grave. . . . His tomb lay at the
foot</p>
<p>of a garden wall, over which pear trees and peach trees thrust their
heads; and on his grave had fallen so many flower petals that his dust
was hidden beneath them. Then I remembered his words at Balkh,</p>
<p>and I fell to weeping, because on the face of the earth, in all
the</p>
<p>regions of the habitable globe, I nowhere saw one like unto him.

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>V. THE AGE OF SA’dI: II50 -129I</p>
<p>Five years after Omar’s death a poet far more honored in Persia was
born at Gandzha, now Kirovabad, near Tiflis. As if in foil to Omar,
Ilyas Abu Muhammad, later known as Nizami, lived a life of genuine
piety, rigorously abstained from wine, and devoted himself to parentage
and poetry. His Romance of Layla and Majnun ( 1 1 88) is the most
popular of all love stories in Persian verse. Qays Majnun (i.e., the
Mad) becomes enamored of Layla, whose father compels her to marry
another man; Majnun, delirious with disappointment, retires from
civilization to the wilderness; only when Layla’s name is mentioned does
he return to brief sanity. Widowed, she joins him, but dies soon
afterward; and Romeo Qays kills himself on her grave. Trans- lation
cannot render the melodious intensity of the original.</p>
<p>Even the mystics sang of love, but we have their solemn assurance
that the passion they portrayed was but a symbol for the love of God.
Muham- mad ibn Ibrahim, known to literature as Farid al- Din Attar
(“Pearl of Faith, Druggist”), was born near Nishapur (1119), and
received his final name from vending perfumes. Feeling a call to
religion, he left his shop and en- tered a Sufi monastery. His forty
books, all in Arabic, include 200,000 lines of poetry. His most famous
work was the Mantiq al-T ayr, or Discourse of the Birds. Thirty birds
(i.e., Sufis) plan a united search for the king of all birds, Simurgh
(Truth). They pass through six valleys: Search, Love,</p>
<p>Knowledge, Detachment (from all personal desire), Unification (where
they perceive that all things are one), and Bewilderment (from losing
all sense of individual existence) . Three of the birds reach the
seventh valley, Annihilation (of the self), and knock at the door of the
hidden king. The royal chamberlain shows each of them a record of its
deeds; they are over- come with shame, and collapse into the dust. But
from this dust they rise again as forms of light; and now they realize
that they and Simurgh (which means thirty birds) are one. They lose
themselves henceforth in Simurgh, as shadows vanish in the sun. In other
works Attar put his pantheism more directly: reason cannot know God, for
it cannot understand itself; but love and ecstasy can reach to God, for
He is the essential reality and power in all things, the sole source of
every act and motion, the spirit and life of the world. No soul is happy
until it loses itself as a part in this spirit as the whole; longing for
such union is the only true religion; self-effacement in that union is
the only true immortality. 45 The orthodox denounced all this as heresy;
a crowd attacked Attar’s house and burned it to the ground. How - ever,
he was relatively indestructible; tradition claims for him a life of 1 1
o years. Before he died, we are told, he laid his hands in blessing upon
the child who would hail him as master, and eclipse his fame.</p>
<p>Jalal-ud-Din Rumi (1201-73) was a native of Balkh, but lived most
of</p>
<p>CHAP.XIv) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 325</p>
<p>his life at Konya* A mysterious Sufi, Shams-i-Tabrizi, came there to
preach, and Jalal was so moved by him that he founded the famous order
of Mawlawi, or Dancing Dervishes, which still makes Konya its capital.
In a comparatively short life Jalal wrote several hundred poems. The
shorter ones, collected as his Divan or Book of Odes , are marked by
such depth of feeling, sincerity, and richness, yet naturalness, of
imagery as place them at the top of all religious poetry composed since
the Psalms. Jalal’s main work, the Mathna r wi-i-Ma &gt; na r wi
(Spiritual Couplets ), is a diffuse exposition of Sufism, a religious
epic outweighing in bulk all the legacy of “Homer.” It has passages of
great beauty, but a thing of beauty, laden with words, is not a joy
forever. The theme again is universal unity.</p>
<p>One knocked at the Beloved’s door, and a Voice asked from within*
“Who is there?”— and he answered, “It is I.” Then the Voice said,</p>
<p>“This house will not hold Me and Thee,” and the door stayed shut.</p>
<p>Then went the Lover into the desert, and in solitude fasted and</p>
<p>prayed. After a year he returned, and knocked again at the door. And
again the Voice asked, “Who is there?” And the Lover said, “It is</p>
<p>Thyself!” And the door wa s opened to him . 46</p>
<p>I looked about me to find him. He was not on the Cross. I went to</p>
<p>the idol temple, to the ancient pagoda; no trace of Him was
visible</p>
<p>there. … I bent the reins of search to the Kaaba; He was not in
that</p>
<p>resort of old and young. I questioned Ibn Sina 〔Avicenna〕 of
His</p>
<p>state; He was not in Ibn Sina’s range. I gazed into my own heart.</p>
<p>There I saw Him. He was nowhere else.</p>

<p>And lastly Sa’di. His real name, of course, was much longer—
Musharrit ud-Din ibn Muslih ud-Din Abdallah. His father held a post at
the court of the</p>
<p>326 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>Atabeg Sad ibn Zangi at Shiraz; when the father died the Atabeg
adopted the boy, and Sa’di, following Moslem custom, added his patron’s
name to his own. Scholars debate the dates of his earthly stay — 1 184-1
283, 49 1184- 129 1, 50 1 1 93- 1 291; 51 in any case he almost spanned
a century. “In my youth,” he tells us, “I was overmuch religious . . .
scrupulously pious and ab - stinent.” 52 After graduating from the
Nizamiya College at Baghdad ( 1226) he began those extraordinary Wander
jahre which took him for thirty years through all the Near and Middle
East, India, Ethiopia, Egypt, and North Africa. He knew every hardship,
and all degrees of poverty; he complained that he had no shoes, until he
met a man without feet, “whereupon I thanked Providence for its bounty
to myself.” 53 In India he exposed the mechanism of a miracle-working
idol, and killed the hidden Brahmin who was the god of the machine; in
his later rollicking verse he recommended a like sum- mary procedure
with all quacks:</p>
<p>You too, should you chance to discover such trick,</p>
<p>Make away with the trickster; don’t spare him; be quick!</p>
<p>For if you should suffer the scoundrel to live,</p>
<p>Be sure that to you he no quarter will give.</p>
<p>So I finished the rogue, notwithstanding his wails,</p>
<p>With stones, for dead men, as you know, tell no tales . 54</p>
<p>He fought against the Crusaders, was captured by the “Infidels,” and
was ransomed. Gratefully he married the daughter of his ransomer. She
turned out to be an int olerable vixen. “The ringlets of the lovely,” he
wrote, “are a chain on the feet of reason.” 55 He divorced her,
encountered more ring - lets, assumed more chains. He outlived this
second wife, retired at fifty to a garden hermitage in Shiraz, and
stayed there the last fifty years of his life.</p>
<p>Having lived, he began to write; all his major works, we are told,
were composed after this retirement. The Pandnama is a Book of Wisdom-,
the Divan is a collection of short poems, mostly in Persian, some in
Arabic, some pious, some obscene. The Bustan, or Orchard , expounds in
didactic verse Sa’di’s general philosophy, relieved by passages of
tender sensuality:</p>
<p>Never had I known moments more delicious. That night I clasped</p>
<p>my lady to my breast and gazed into her eyes swimming with</p>
<p>sleep I said to her: “Beloved, my slender cypress tree, now is
not</p>
<p>the time to sleep. Sing, my nightingale! Let thy mouth open as
un-</p>
<p>folds the rosebud. Sleep no more, turmoil of my heart! Let thy
lips</p>
<p>offer me the philter of thy love.” And my lady looked upon me and</p>
<p>murmured low: “Turmoil of thy heart? Yet dost thou wake me?”</p>
<p>. . . Thy lady has repeated all this time that she has never belonged
to another. . . . And thou dost smile, for thou knowest that she lies.
But what matter? Are her lips less warm beneath thy lips? Are her shoul-
ders less soft beneath thy caress? . . . They say the breeze of May
is</p>
<p>sweet, as the perfume of the rose, the song of the nightingale,
the</p>
<p>327</p>

<p>green plain, and the blue sky. O thou who knowest not, all these are
sweet only when one’s lady is there! 56</p>
<p>The Gulistan, or Rose Garden ( 1 258) , is a medley of instructive
anecdotes interspersed with delectable poetry.</p>
<p>An unjust king asked a holy man, “What is more excellent than</p>
<p>prayer?” The holy man said: “For you to remain asleep till
midday,</p>
<p>that for this one interval you may not afflict mankind.” 57 Ten der
-</p>
<p>vishes can sleep on one rug, but two kings cannot be accommodated in
a whole kingdom. 58 If you court riches, ask not for content-</p>
<p>ment. 59 The religious man who can be vexed by an injury is as yet a
shallow brook. 60 Never has anyone acknowledged his own igno-</p>
<p>rance, except that person who, while another is talking and has
not</p>
<p>yet finished, begins to speak. 61 Had you but one perfection and sev-
enty faults, your lover would discern only that one perfection. 62</p>
<p>Hurry not . . . learn deliberation. The Arab horse makes a few</p>
<p>stretches at full speed, and breaks down; the camel, at its
deliberate pace, travels night and day, and gets to the end of its
journey. 63 Ac- quire knowledge, for no reliance can be placed on riches
or posses-</p>
<p>sions. . . . Were a professional man to lose his fortune, he need
not</p>
<p>feel regret, for his knowledge is of itself a mine of wealth. 64 The
se- verity of the schoolmaster is more useful than the indulgence of the
father. 65 Were intellect to be annihilated from the face of the earth,
nobody could.be brought to say, “I am ignorant.” * 66 Levity in a nut is
a sign of its being empty. 67</p>
<p>Sa’di was a philosopher, but he forfeited the name by writing
intelligibly. His was a healthier philosophy than Omar’s; it understood
the consolations of faith, and knew how to heal the sting of knowledge
with the simple bless- ings of a kindly life; Sa’di experienced all the
tragedies of the human com - edy, and yet insisted on a hundred years.
But he was a poet as well as a philosopher: sensitive to the form and
texture of every beauty from a woman’s “cypress limbs” to a star that
for a moment possesses by itself all the evening sky; and capable of
expressing wisdom or platitude with brev- ity, delicacy, and grace. He
was never at a loss for an illuminating com- parison or an arresting
phrase. “To give education to the worthless is like throwing walnuts
upon a dome”; 08 “a friend and I were associating like two kernels in
one almond shell”; 69 “if the orb of the sun had been in the wallet” of
this stingy merchant, “nobody would have seen daylight in t he world
till Judgment Day.” 70 In the end, despite his wisdom, Sa’di remained
the poet, surrendering his wisdom with a whole heart to the rich slavery
of love.</p>

<li>MOSLEM SCIENCE: IO57-1258</li>
</ol>
<p>Moslem scholars divided the medieval peoples into two classes — those
that cul- tivated science, and those that did not. In the first class
they named the Hindus, Persians, Babylonians, Jews, Greeks, Egyptians,
and Arabs. These, in their view, were the elite of the world; the
others, of whom the Chinese and the Turks were the best, resembled
animals rather than men. 72 The judgment sinned chiefly against the
Chinese.</p>
<p>The Moslems continued, in this period, their unchallenged ascendancy
in sci- ence. In mathematics the most signal advances were made in
Morocco and Azerbaijan; we see here again the range of Islamic
civilization. In 1229 Hasan al-Marraqushi (i.e., of Marraqesh) published
tables of sines for each degree, and tables of versed sines, arc sines,
and arc cotangents. A generation later Nasir ud-Din al-Tusi (i.e., of
Tus) issued the first treatise in which trigonometry was considered as
an independent science rather than an appendage to astronomy; this Kitab
shakl al-qatta remained without a rival in its field until the De Trian
- giilis of Regiomontanus two centuries later. Perhaps Chinese
trigonometry, which appears in the second half of the thirteenth
century, was of Arabic origin. 73</p>
<p>The outstanding work of physical science in this age was the Kitab
mizan al-hikmah , or Book of the Balance of Wisdom , written about 1122
by a Greek slave from Asia Minor, Abu’l Fath al -Khuzini. It gave a
history of physics, formu- lated the laws of the lever, compiled tables
of specific gravity for many liquids and solids, and proposed a theory
of gravitation as a universal force drawing all things towards the
center of the earth. 74 Water wheels, known to the Greeks and Romans,
were improved by the Moslems; the Crusaders saw such wheels raising
water from the Orontes, and introduced them into Germany. 75
Alchemists</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 329</p>
<p>flourished; they knew, said al- Latif, “300 ways of making dupes.” 70
One alche - mist “drew from Nur-ud-din a substantial loan for alchemical
research, and dis- appeared; a wit, apparently unreproved, published a
list of fools in which Nur- ud- din’s name led all the rest; and
offered, if the alchemist would return, to substitute his name for that
of the Sultan. 77</p>
<p>In 1081 Ibrahim al-Sahdi of Valencia constructed the oldest known
celestial globe, a brass sphere 209 millimeters (81.5 inches) in
diameter; upon its surface, in forty-seven constellations, were engraved
1015 stars in their respective magni- tudes. 78 The Giralda of Seville
(1190) was an observatory as well as a minaret; there Jabir ibn Aflah
made the observations for his lslalo al-majisti , or Correction of the
Almagest (1240). The same reaction against Ptolemaic astronomy marked
the works of Abu Ishaq al-Bitruji (Alpetragius) of Cordova, who paved
the way for Copernicus by destructively criticizing the theory of
epicycles and eccen- trics through which Ptolemy had sought to explain
the paths and motions of the stars.</p>
<p>The age produced two geographers of universal medieval renown. Abu
Ab- dallah Muhammad al-Idrisi was born at Ceuta (1100), studied at
Cordova, and wrote in Palermo, at the behest of King Roger II of Sicily,
his Kitab al-Rujari (Roger’s Book) . It divided the earth into seven
climatic zones, and each zone into ten parts; each of the seventy parts
was illustrated by a detailed map; these maps were the crowning
achievement of medieval cartography, unprecedented in full- ness,
accuracy, and scope. Al-Idrisi, like most Moslem scientists, took for
granted the sphericity of the earth. Rivaling him for the honor of being
the greatest medieval geographer was Abu Abdallah Yaqut (1 179-12 29).
Born a Greek in Asia Minor, he was captured in war and enslaved; but the
Baghdad merchant who bought him gave him a good education, and then
freed him. He traveled much, first as a merchant, then as a geographer
fascinated by places and their diverse populations, dress, and ways. He
rejoiced to find ten libraries at Merv, one containing 12,000 volumes;
the discriminating curators allowed him to take as many as 200 volumes
at a time to his room; those who have loved books as the lifeblood of
great men will sense the dusty joy he felt in these treasuries of the
mind. He moved on to Khiva and Balkh; there the Mongols almost caught
him in their murderous advance; he fled, naked but clutching his
manuscripts, across Persia to Mosul. While buttering the bread of
poverty as a copyist, he completed his Mu’ jam al-Buldan (1228) — a vast
geographical encyclopedia which summed up nearly all medieval knowledge
of the globe. Yaqut included almost everything — astronomy, physics,
archaeology, ethnography, history, giving the co-ordinates of the cities
and the lives and works of their famous men. Seldom has any man so loved
the earth.</p>
<p>Botany, almost forgotten since Theophrastus, revived with the Moslems
of this age. Al-Idrisi wrote a herbal, but stressed the botanical rather
than merely the medicinal interest of 360 plants. A bu’l Abbas of
Seville (1216) earned the surname of al-Nabati, the Botanist, by his
studies of plant life from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Abu Muhammad ibn
Baitar of Malaga (1190-1248) gathered all Islamic botany into a vast
work of extraordinary erudition, which remained the standard botanical
authority till the sixteenth century, and marked him as the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>greatest botanist and pharmacist of the Middle Ages. 79 Ibn al-Awan
of Seville (1190) won a like pre-eminence in agronomy; his Kitab
al-Falaha ( Book of the Peasant ) analyzed soils and manures, described
the cultivation of 585 plants and fifty fruit trees, explained methods
of grafting, and discussed the symptoms and cures of plant diseases.
This was the most complete treatment of agricultural science in the
whole medieval period. 80</p>
<p>In this as in the preceding age the Moslems produced the leading
physi- cians of Asia, Africa, and Europe. They excelled especially in
ophthal- mology, perhaps because eye diseases were so prevalent in the
Near East; there, as elsewhere, medicine was paid most to cure, least to
prevent. Oper- ations for cataract were numerous. Khalifah ibn- abi’l
-Mahasin of Aleppo (1256) was so confident of his skill that he operated
for cataract on a one- eyed man. 81 Ibn Baitar’s Kitab al -Jami made
medicinal-botanical history; it listed 1400 plants, foods, and drugs,
300 of them new; analyzed their chem- ical constitution and healing
power; and added acute observations on their use in therapy. But the
greatest name in this acme of Moslem medicine is Abu Marwan ibn Zuhr
(1091-1162) of Seville, known to the European medical world as Avenzoar.
He was the third in six generations of famous physicians, all of one
family line, and each at the top of his profession. His Kitab al-Tasir,
or Book of Simplification on Therapeutics and Diet, was written at the
request of his friend Averroes, who (himself the greatest phi- losopher
of the age) considered him the greatest physician since Galen. Ibn
Zuhr’s forte was clinical description; he left classical analyses of
mediastinal tumors, pericarditis, intestinal tuberculosis, and
pharyngeal paralysis. 82 Translations of the T asir into Hebrew and
Latin deeply influenced Euro- pean medicine.</p>
<p>Islam led the world also in the equipment and competence of its
hospitals. One founded by Nur-ud-din at Damascus in 1160 gave free
treatment and drugs during three centuries; for 267 years, we are told,
its fires were never extinguished. 83 Ibn Jubayr, coming to Baghdad in
1184, marveled at the great Bimaristan Adadi, a hospital rising like
some royal palace along the banks of the Tigris; here food and drugs
were given to the patients without charge. 84 In Cairo, in 1285, Sultan
Qalaun began the Maristan al-Mansur, the greatest hospital of the Middle
Ages. Within a spacious quadrangular enclosure four buildings rose
around a courtyard adorned with arcades and cooled with fountains and
brooks. There were separate wards for diverse diseases and for
convalescents; laboratories, a dispensary, out-patient clinics, diet
kitchens, baths, a library, a chapel, a lecture hall, and particularly
pleas- ant accommodations for the insane. Treatment was given gratis to
men and women, rich and poor, slave and free; and a sum of money was
disbursed to each convalescent on his departure, so that he need not at
once return to work. The sleepless were provided with soft music,
professional story-</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 3 3 1</p>
<p>tellers, and perhaps books of history. 85 Asylums for the care of the
insane existed in all the major cities of Islam.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>AL-GHAZALI AND THE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid these advances of science the old orthodoxy fought to keep the
loy- alty of the educated classes. The conflict between religion and
science led many to skepticism, some to open atheism. Al-Ghazali divided
Moslem thinkers into three groups — theists, deists or naturalists, and
materialists — and denounced all three groups alike as infidels. The
theists accepted God and immortality, but denied creation and the
resurrection of the body, and called heaven and hell spiritual
conditions only; the deists acknowledged a deity but rejected
immortality, and viewed the world as a self-operating machine; the
materialists completely rejected the idea of God. A semi- organized
movement, the Dahriyya, professed a frank agnosticism; several of these
doubting Thomases lost their heads to the executioner. “You tor - ment
yourself for nothing,” said Isbahan ibn Qara to a pious faster during
Ramadan; “man is like a seed of grain that sprouts and grows up and is
then mowed down to perish forever. . . . Eat and drink!” 86</p>
<p>It was in reaction against such skepticism that Mohammedanism
produced its greatest theologian, the Augustine and the Kant of Islam.
Abu Hamid al-Ghazali was born at Tus in 1058, lost his father early, and
was reared by a Sufi friend. He studied law, theology, and philosophy;
at thirty-three he was appointed to the chair of law at the Nizamiya
College in Baghdad; soon all Islam acclaimed his eloquence, erudition,
and dialectical skill. After four years of this glory he was laid low by
a mysterious disease. Appetite and digestion failed, paralysis of the
tongue occasionally distorted his speech, and his mind began to break
down. A wise physician diagnosed his case as mental in origin. In truth,
as al-Ghazali later confessed in his remarkable autobiography, he had
lost belief in the capacity of reason to sanction the Mohammedan faith;
and the hypocrisy of his orthodox teaching had be- come unbearable. In
1094 he left Baghdad, ostensibly on a pilgrimage to Mecca; actually he
went into seclusion, seeking silence, contemplation, and peace. Unable
to find in science the support he sought for his crumbling faith, he
turned from the outer to the internal world; there, he thought, he found
a direct and immaterial reality, which offered a firm basis for belief
in a spiritual universe. He subjected sensation — on which materialism
seemed to rest — to critical scrutiny; accused the senses of making the
stars appear small when, to be so visible from afar, they must be vastly
larger than the earth; and concluded from a hundred such examples that
sensation by itself could be no certain test of truth. Reason was
higher, and corrected one sense with another; but in the end it too
rested on sensation. Perhaps there</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>332</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>was in man a form of knowledge, a guide to truth, surer than reason?
Al-Ghazali felt that he had found this in the introspective meditation
of the mystic: the Sufi came closer than the philosopher to the hidden
core of reality; the highest knowledge lay in gazing upon the miracle of
mind until God appeared within the self, and the self itself disappeared
in the vision of an all-absorbing One . 87</p>
<p>In this mood al-Ghazali wrote his most influential book — Tahafut al-
Filasifa ( The Destruction of Philosophy) . All the arts of reason were
turned against reason. By a “transcendental dialectic” as subtle as
Kant’s, the Mos - lem mystic argued that reason leads to universal
doubt, intellectual bank- ruptcy, moral deterioration, and social
collapse. Seven centuries before Hume, al-Ghazali reduced reason to the
principle of causality, and causal- ity to mere sequence: all that we
perceive is that B regularly follows A, not that A causes B. Philosophy,
logic, science, cannot prove the existence of God or the immortality of
the soul; only direct intuition can assure us of these beliefs, without
which no moral order, and therefore no civilization, can survive .
88</p>
<p>In the end al-Ghazali returned through mysticism to all orthodox
views. The old fears and hopes of his youth flowed back upon him, and he
pro- fessed to feel the eyes and threats of a stern deity close over his
head. He proclaimed anew the horrors of the Mohammedan hell, and urged
their preaching as necessary to popular morality . 89 He accepted again
the Koran and the Hadith. In his Ihya Uluin al-Din ( Revival of the
Science of Religion) he expounded and defended his renovated orthodoxy
with all the eloquence and fervor of his prime; never in Islam had the
skeptics and the philoso- phers encountered so vigorous a foe. When he
died ( 1 1 1 1 ) , the tide of un- belief had been effectually turned.
All orthodoxy took comfort from him; even Christian theologians were
glad to find, in his translated works, such a defense of religion, and
such an exposition of piety, as no one had written since Augustine.
After him, and despite Averroes, philosophy hid itself in the remote
corners of the Moslem world; the pursuit of science waned; and the mind
of Islam more and more buried itself in the Hadith and the Koran.</p>
<p>The conversion of al-Ghazali to mysticism was a great victory for
Sufism. Orthodoxy now accepted Sufism, which for a time engulfed
theology. The mullahs — learned exponents of Moslem doctrine and law —
still dominated the official religious and legal world; but the field of
religious thought was yielded to Sufi monks and saints. Strangely
contemporary with the rise of the Franciscans in Christendom, a new
monasticism took form in twelfth-century Islam. Sufi dev- otees now
abandoned family life, lived in religious fraternities under a sheik or
master, and called themselves dervish or faqir — a Persian and an Arabic
word for poor man or mendicant. Some by prayer and meditation, some by
ascetic self- denial, others in the exhaustion that followed wild
dancing, sought to transcend the self and rise to a wonder-working unity
with God.</p>
<p>CHAP. Xiv) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 333</p>
<p>Their doctrine received formulation in the 150 books of Muhyi al-Din
ibn al-Arabi (1 165-1240) — a Spanish Moslem domiciled in Damascus. The
world was never created, said al-Arabi, for it is the external aspect of
that which in in- ward view is God. History is the development of God to
self-consciousness, which He achieves at last in man. Hell is temporary;
in the end all will be saved. Love is mistaken when it loves a physical
and transitory form; it is God Who ap- pears in the beloved, and the
true lover will find and love the author of all beauty in any beautiful
form. Perhaps recalling some Christians of Jerome’s time, al - Arabi
taught that “he who loves and remains chaste unto death dies a martyr,”
and achieves the highest reach of devotion. Many married dervishes
professed to live in such chastity with their wives. 90</p>
<p>Through the gifts of the people some Moslem religious orders became
wealthy, and consented to enjoy life. “Formerly,” complained a Syrian
sheik about 1250, “the Sufis were a fraternity dispersed in 4 the flesh
but united in the spirit; now they are a body well clothed carnally, and
ragged in divine mystery.” 91 The populace smiled tolerantly at these
sacred worldlings, but lavished worship upon sincere devotees, ascribed
to them miraculous deeds and powers, honored them as saints, celebrated
their birthdays, prayed for their intercession with Allah, and made
pilgrimages to their tombs. Mohammedanism, like Christianity, was a de-
veloping and adjustable religion, which would have startled a reborn
Mohammed or Christ.</p>
<p>As orthodoxy triumphed, toleration waned. From Harun al-Rashid on,
the so- called “Ordinance of Omar,” formerly ignored, was increasingly
observed . Theoretically, though not always in practice, non-Moslems
were now required to wear distinguishing yellow stripes on their
clothing; they were forbidden to ride on horseback, but might use an ass
or a mule; they were not to build new churches or synagogues, but might
repair old ones; no cross was to be displayed outside a church, no
church bell should ring; non-Moslem children were not to be admitted to
Moslem schools, but could have schools of their own: this is still the
letter of the law — not always enforced — in Islam. 92 Nevertheless
there were 45,000 Christians in tenth-century Baghdad; 93 Christian
funeral processions passed unharmed through the streets; 94 and Moslem
protests continued against the employment of Christians and Jews in high
office. Even in the heat and chal- lenge of the Crusades Saladin could
be generous to the Christians in his realm.</p>

<p>For a time philosophy survived in Moslem Spain by judiciously
sprinkling professions of orthodoxy among the timid tentatives of
critique; and thought found a precarious freedom in the courts of rulers
who enjoyed in private the speculations that they accounted harmful to
the populace. So the Almo- ravid governor of Saragossa chose as his
minister and friend Abu Bekr ibn Bajja, who had been born there about
1106. Avempace, as Europe would call him, had reached even in youth an
extraordinary proficiency in science,</p>
<p>334 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>medicine, philosophy, music, and poetry. Ibn Khaldun tells how the
gov- ernor so admired some verses of the young scholar that he vowed the
poet should always walk on gold when entering his presence; whereupon
ibn Bajja, lest this vow should abate his welcome, put a gold coin in
each of his shoes. When Saragossa fell to the Christians the
poet-scientist-minister fled to Fez, where he found himself destitute
among Moslems who accused him of atheism. He died at the age of thirty,
allegedly by poison. His lost treatise on music was accounted the
masterpiece on that subtle subject in the liter- ature of Western Islam.
His most famous work, A Guide to the Solitary , renewed a basic theme of
Arabic philosophy. The human intellect, said Ibn Bajja, is composed of
two parts: the “material intellect,” which is bound up with the body and
dies with it; and the “Active Intellect,” or impersonal cosmic mind,
which enters into all men, and is alone immortal. Thought is man’s
highest function; by thought, rather than by mystic ecstasy, man can
attain to knowledge of, and union with, the Active Intellect, or God.
But thinking is a perilous enterprise, except in silence. The wise man
will live in quiet seclusion, shunning doctors, lawyers, and the people;
or perhaps a few philosophers will form a community where they may
pursue knowledge in tolerant companionship, far from the maddened crowd.
95</p>
<p>Abu Bekr (Europe’s Abubacer) ibn Tufail ( 1 107?— 1 1 85) continued
the ideas of Ibn Bajja, and almost realized his ideals. He too was
scientist, poet, physician, and philosopher. He became the doctor and
vizier of the Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf at Marraqesh, the Almohad capital
in Morocco; he man- aged to spend most of his waking hours in the royal
library, and found time to write, among more technical works, the most
remarkable philosophical romance in medieval literature. It took its
title from Ibn Sina, and (through Ockley’s English translation in 1708)
may have suggested Robinson Crusoe to Defoe.</p>
<p>Hayy ibn Yaqzan (“Alive, Son of Vigilant”), who gives his name to the
tale, was cast in infancy upon an uninhabited island. Nursed by a
she-goat, he grew in intelligence and skill, made his shoes and clothes
from animal skins, studied the stars, dissected animals alive or dead,
and “arrived at the highest degree of knowledge, in this kind, which the
most learned natural- ists ever attained.” 96 He passed from science to
philosophy and theology, demonstrated to himself the existence of an
all-powerful Creator, practiced asceticism, forswore meat, and achieved
an ecstatic union with the Active Intellect. 97 Hayy was now forty-nine,
and ripe for an audience. Fortunately a mystic named Asal now had
himself deposited on the island, seeking soli- tude. Fie met Hayy, who
for the first time discovered the existence of man- kind; Asal taught
him language, and rejoiced to find that Hayy had arrived unaided at a
knowledge of God. He confessed to Hayy the coarseness of the popular
religion in the land from which he, Asal, had come, and mourned that a
modicum of morality had been achieved only by promises of heaven</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 335</p>
<p>and threats of hell. Hayy resolved to go and convert this benighted
people to a higher and more philosophical religion. Arrived, he preached
his pan- theism in the market place. The populace ignored him, or did
not under- stand him. Hayy concluded that Mohammed was right: that the
people can be disciplined to social order only by a religion of myth,
miracle, ceremony, and supernatural punishments and rewards. He
apologized for his intrusion, returned to his island, and lived there
with Asal in daily companionship with placid animals and the Active
Intellect; and “thus they continued serving God until they died.”</p>
<p>It was with a rare absence of jealousy that Ibn Tufail, about 1153,
intro- duced to the favor of Abu Yakub Yusuf a young lawyer and
physician, known to Islam as Abu al-Walid Muhammad ibn Rushd (1126-98),
and to medieval Europe as Averroes — the most influential figure in
Islamic phi- losophy. His grandfather and his father had in turn been
chief justice of Cordova, and had lavished on him all the education that
the old capital could provide. One of his pupils has transmitted what
purports to be Averroes’ own account of his first interview with the
Emir.</p>
<p>When I was presented to the Prince of Believers I found him alone</p>
<p>with Ibn Tufail, who . . . sounded my praises to him with compli-</p>
<p>ments that I did not deserve. . . . The Emir opened the conversation
by asking, “What opinion did the philosophers hold abou t the heav- ens?
Are they eternal, or did they have a beginning?” I was overcome with
terror and confusion, and sought some pretext for not answer- ing . . .
but the Emir, perceiving my trouble, turned to Ibn Tufail,</p>
<p>and began to discourse with him on the question, recalling the opin-
ions of Plato and Aristotle and other philosophers, and the objections
that had been made to them by Moslem theologians; all with such full-
ness of memory as I should not have expected even of professional</p>
<p>philosophers. The Emir put me at my ease, and tested my
knowledge.</p>
<p>When I had retired he sent me a sum of money, a riding horse, and a
costly robe of honor.“</p>
<p>In 1169 Averroes was appointed chief justice of Seville; in 1 172, of
Cordova. Ten years later Abu Yaqub called him to Marraqesh to serve as
court phy- sician; and he continued in this capacity when (1 184) Yaqub
was succeeded by Yaqub al-Mansur. In 1 194 he was banished to Lucena,
near Cordova, to satisfy public resentment of his heresies. He was
forgiven and recalled in 1 198, but died in that year. His tomb may
still be seen at Marraqesh.</p>
<p>His work in medicine has been almost forgotten in his fame as a
philoso- pher; he was, however, “one of the greatest physicians of his
time,” the first to explain the function of the retina, and to recognize
that an attack of smallpox confers subsequent immunity.“ His
encyclopedia of medicine ( Kitab al-Kulliyat fi-l-tibb), translated into
Latin, was widely used as a text in Christian universities. Meanwhile
the Emir Abu Yaqub had expressed the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>33&lt;5</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>wish that someone would write a clear exposition of Aristotle; and
Ibn Tu- fail recommended the task to Averroes. The suggestion was
welcomed, for Averroes had already concluded that all philosophy was
contained in the Stagirite, who merely needed interpretation to be made
contemporary with any age. # He resolved to prepare for each major work
of Aristotle first a summary, then a brief commentary, then a detailed
commentary for ad- vanced students — a mode of progressively complex
exposition habitual in Moslem universities. Unfortunately he knew no
Greek, and had to rely on Arabic translations of Syriac translations of
Aristotle; nevertheless his pa- tience, perspicuity, and keen analyses
won him throughout Europe the name of the Commentator, and placed him at
once near the head of Moslem phi- losophy, second only to the great
Avicenna himself.</p>
<p>To these writings he added several works of his own on logic,
physics, psychology, metaphysics, theology, law, astronomy, and grammar,
and a reply to al- Ghazali’s Destruction of Philosophy under the title
of Destruction of the Destruction ( Tahafut al-Tahafut). He argued, as
Francis Bacon would, that though a little philosophy might incline a man
to atheism, un- hindered study would lead to a better understanding
between religion and philosophy. For though the philosopher cannot
accept in their literal sense the dogmas of “the Koran, the Bible, and
other revealed books ,” 100 he per- ceives their necessity in developing
a wholesome piety and morality among the people, who are so harassed
with economic importunities that they find no time for more than
incidental, superficial, and dangerous thinking on first and last
things. Hence the mature philosopher will neither utter nor encourage
any word against the established faith . 101 In return the philoso- pher
should be left free to seek the truth; but he should confine his discus
- sions within the circle and comprehension of the educated, and make no
propaganda among the populace . 102 Symbolically interpreted, the
doctrines of religion can be harmonized with the findings of science and
philosophy ; 103 such interpretation of sacred texts through symbol and
allegory has been practiced, even by divines, for centuries. Averroes
does not explicitly teach, he merely implies, the doctrine imputed to
him by Christian critics — that a proposition may be true in philosophy
(among the educated) and false (harmful) in religion (and morals ). 104
Hence the opinions of Averroes must be sought not in the minor treatises
which he composed for a general audi- ence, but in his more recondite
commentaries on Aristotle.</p>
<p>He defines philosophy as “an inquiry into the meaning of existence,”
with a view to the improvement of man . 103 The world is eternal; the
movements of the heavens never began, and will never end; creation is a
myth.</p>
<p>The partisans of creation argue that the agent 〔God〕 produces a</p>
<ul>
<li>new〕 being without needing for its production any pre-existing
ma-</li>
</ul>
<p>Santayana, in The Life of Reason , adopted the same principle.</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM</p>
<p>terial. … It is such imagining that has led the theologians of the
three religions existing in our day to say that something can issue from
noth- ing. 106 . . . Motion is eternal and continuous; all motion has
its cause in a preceding motion. Without motion there is no time. We
cannot conceive of motion having either a beginning or an end. 107</p>
<p>Nonetheless God is the creator of the world in the sense that it
exists at any moment only through His sustaining power, and undergoes,
so to speak, a continuous creation through the divine energy. 108 God is
the order, force, and mind of the universe.</p>
<p>From this supreme order and intelligence there emanates an order and
in- telligence in the planets and the stars. From the intelligence in
the lowest of the celestial circles (that of the moon) comes the Active
or Effective Intel - lect, which enters into the body and mind of
individual men. The human mind is composed of two elements. One is the
passive or material intellect — a capacity and possibility of thought,
forming a part of the body, and dying with it (the nervous system? ) .
The other is the Active Intellect — a divine influx which activates the
passive intellect into actual thought. This Active Intellect has no
individuality; it is the same in all men; and it alone is immortal. 109
Averroes compares the operation of the Active Intellect upon the
individual or passive intellect with the influence of the sun, whose
light makes many objects luminous, but remains everywhere and
permanently one. 110 And as fire reaches out to a combustible body, so
the individual in- tellect aspires to be united with the Active
Intellect. In this union the human mind becomes like unto God, for it
holds all the universe potentially in the grasp of its thought; indeed
the world and its contents have no existence for us, and no meaning,
except through the mind that apprehends them. 111 Only the perception of
truth through reason can lead the mind to that union with God which the
Sufis think to reach by ascetic discipline or intoxicat- ing dance.
Averroes has no use for mysticism. His notion of paradise is the quiet
and kindly wisdom of the sage. 112</p>
<p>This was Aristotle’s conclusion too; and of course the theory of the
active and passive intellect ( nous poietikos and nous pathetikos) goes
back to Aris- totle’s De Anima (iii, 5) as interpreted by Alexander of
Aphrodisias and Themistius of Alexandria, transformed into the emanation
theory of the Neoplatonists, and transmitted in philosophic dynasty
through al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Ibn Bajja. Here at the end, as in its
beginning, Arabic philos- ophy was Aristotle Neoplatonized. But whereas
in most Moslem and Chris- tian philosophers Aristotle’s doctrines were
retailored to meet the needs of theology, in Averroes Mohammedan dogmas
were reduced to a minimum to reconcile them with Aristotle. Hence
Averroes had more influence in Christendom than in Islam. His Moslem
contemporaries persecuted him, Moslem posterity forgot him, and allowed
most of his works to be lost in their Arabic form. Jews preserved many
of them in Hebrew translation, and</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>Maimonides followed in Averroes’ steps in seeking to reconcile
religion and philosophy. In Christendom the Commentaries, translated
into Latin from the Hebrew, fed the heresies of Siger de Brabant, and
the rationalism of the School of Padua, and threatened the foundations
of Christian belief. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote his Summae to stem this
Averroistic tide; but he fol- lowed Averroes in the method of his
Commentaries, in divers interpretations of Aristotle, in choosing matter
as the “principle of individuation,” in the symbolical explanation of
anthropomorphic Scriptural texts, in admitting the possible eternity of
the world, in rejecting mysticism as a sufficient basis for theology,
and in recognizing that some dogmas of religion are beyond reason, and
can be accepted by faith alone. 113 Roger Bacon ranked Averroes next to
Aristotle and Avicenna, and added, with characteristic exaggeration,
“The philosophy of Averroes today 〔 c . 1270〕 obtains the unanimous
suf - f rage of wise men.” 114</p>
<p>In 1150 the Caliph Mustanjid, at Baghdad, ordered burned all the
philo- sophical works of Avicenna and the Brethren of Sincerity. In 1194
the Emir Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, then at Seville, ordered the burning
of all works by Averroes except a few on natural science; he forbade his
subjects to study philosophy, and urged them to throw into a fire all
books of philoso- phy wherever found. These instructions were eagerly
carried out by the people, who resented attacks upon a faith that for
most of them was the dear- est solace of their harassed lives. About
this time Ibn Habib was put to death for studying philosophy. 115 After
1 200 Islam shunned speculative thought. As political power declined in
the Moslem world, it sought more and more the aid of the theologians and
lawyers of orthodoxy. That aid was given, but in return for the
suppression of independent thought. Even so, the aid did not suffice to
save the state. In Spain the Christians advanced from city to city,
until only Granada remained Moslem. In the East the Crusaders cap- tured
Jerusalem; and in 1 258 the Mongols took and destroyed Baghdad.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE COMING OF THE MONGOLS: 1219-58</li>

<p>Once again history illustrated the truism that civilized comfort
attracts barbarian conquest. The Seljuqs had brought new strength to
Eastern Islam; but they too had succumbed to ease, and had allowed the
empire of Malik Shah to break down into autonomous kingdoms culturally
brilliant and militarily weak. Religious fanaticism and racial
antipathies divided the people into bitter sects, and frustrated any
united defense against the Crusades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the plains and deserts of northwestern Asia, the
Mongols thrived on hardships and primitive fertility. They lived in
tents or the open</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 339</p>
<p>air, followed their herds to fresh pastures, clothed themselves in
oxhides, and studied with relish the arts of war. These new Huns, like
their kin of eight centuries back, were experts with dagger and sword,
and arrows aimed from their flying steeds. If we may believe the
Christian missionary Giovanni de Piano Carpini, “they eat anything
edible, even lice”; 118 and they had as little repugnance to feeding on
rats, cats, dogs, and human blood as our most cultured contemporaries to
eating eels and snails. Jenghiz Khan (1167-</p>
<ol start="1227" type="1">
<li>— i.e., the Great King — disciplined them with severe laws into an
irre- sistible force, and led them to the conquest of Central Asia from
the Volga to the Chinese Wall. During the absence of Jenghiz Khan from
his capital at Karokorum, a Mongol chieftain rebelled against him, and
formed a league with Ala al-Din Muhammad, the Shah of the independent
state of Khwarizm. Jenghiz suppressed the rebellion, and sent the Shah
an offer of peace. The offer was accepted; but shortly thereafter two
Mongol merchants in Trans- oxiana were executed as spies by Muhammad’s
governor of Otrar. Jenghiz demanded the extradition of the governor;
Muhammad refused, beheaded the chief of the Mongol embassy, and sent its
other members back without their beards. Jenghiz declared war, and the
Mongol invasion of Islam began (1219).</li>
</ol>
<p>An army under the Khan’s son Juji defeated Muhammad’s 400,000 troops
at Jand; the Shah fled to Samarkand, leaving 160,000 of his men dead on
the field. Another army, under Jenghiz’ son Jagatai, captured and sacked
Otrar.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>strike a paralyzing terror into the hearts of later opponents, and to
leave no possibility of revolt among the defeated. The policy
succeeded.</p>
<p>Jenghiz now returned to Mongolia, enjoyed his 500 wives and
concubines, and died in bed. His son and successor Ogotai sent a horde
of 300,000 men to capture Jalal ud-Din, who had formed another army at
Diarbekr; Jalal was defeated and killed, and the unhindered Mongols
ravaged Azerbaijan, north- ern Mesopotamia, Georgia, and Armenia ( 1 2
34) . Hearing that a rebellion, led by the Assassins, had broken out in
Iran, Hulagu, a grandson of Jenghiz, led a Mongol army through Samarkand
and Balkh, destroyed the Assassin stronghold at Alamut, and turned
toward Baghdad.</p>
<p>Al-Mustasim Billah, last of the Abbasid caliphs of the East, was a
learned scholar, a meticulous calligrapher, a man of exemplary
gentleness, devoted to religion, books, and charity: this was an enemy
to Hulagu’s taste. The Mongol accused the Caliph of sheltering rebels,
and of withholding promised aid against the Assassins; as penalty he
demanded the submission of the Caliph to the Great Khan, and the
complete demilitarization of Baghdad. Al- Mustasim returned a boastful
refusal. After a month of siege, al-Mustasim sent Hulagu presents and an
offer of surrender. Lured by a promise of clem- ency, he and his two
sons gave themselves up to the Mongol. On February 13, 1258, Hulagu and
his troops entered Baghdad, and began forty days of pillage and
massacre; 800,000 of the inhabitants, we are told, were killed.
Thousands of scholars, scientists, and poets fell in the indiscriminate
slaugh- ter; libraries and treasures accumulated through centuries were
in a week plundered or destroyed; hundreds of thousands of volumes were
consumed. Finally the Caliph and his family, after being forced to
reveal the hiding place of their secret wealth, were put to death. 119
So ended the Abbasid caliphate in Asia.</p>
<p>Hulagu now returned to Mongolia. His army remained behind, and under
other generals it advanced to the conquest of Syria. At Ain Jalut it met
an Egyptian army under the Mamluk leaders Qutuz and Baibars, and was de-
stroyed ( 1260) . Everywhere in Islam and Europe men of all faiths
rejoiced; the spell of fear was broken. In 1 303 a decisive battle near
Damascus ended the Mongol threat, and saved Syria for the Mamluks,
perhaps Europe for Christianity.</p>
<p>Never in history had a civilization suffered so suddenly so
devastating a blow. The barbarian conquest of Rome had been spread over
two centuries; between each blow and the next some recovery was
possible; and the German conquerors respected, some tried to preserve,
the dying Empire which they helped to destroy. But the Mongols came and
went within forty years; they came not to conquer and stay, but to kill,
pillage, and carry their spoils to Mongolia. When their bloody tide
ebbed it left behind it a fatally disrupted economy, canals broken or
choked, schools and libraries in ashes, govern- ments too divided, poor,
and weak to govern, and a population cut in half</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 34I</p>
<p>and shattered in soul. Epicurean indulgence, physical and mental
exhaustion, military incompetence and cowardice, religious sectarianism
and obscurant- ism, political corruption and anarchy, all culminating in
piecemeal collapse before external attack — this, and no change of
climate, turned Western Asia from world leadership to destitution, from
a hundred teeming and cultured cities in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, the
Caucasus, and Transoxiana into the poverty, disease, and stagnation of
modern times.</p>
<p>X. ISLAM AND CHRISTENDOM</p>
<p>The rise and decline of Islamic civilization is one of the major
phenomena of history. For five centuries, from 700 to 1 200, Islam led
the world in power, order, and extent of government, in refinement of
manners, in standards of living, in humane legislation and religious
toleration, in literature, scholar- ship, science, medicine, and
philosophy. In architecture it yielded the palm, in the twelfth century,
to the cathedrals of Europe; and Gothic sculpture found no rival in
inhibited Islam. Moslem art exhausted itself in decoration, and suffered
from narrowness of range and monotony of style; but within its
self-imposed limits it has never been surpassed. In Islam art and
culture were more widely shared than in medieval Christendom; kings were
callig- raphers, and merchants, like physicians, might be
philosophers.</p>
<p>In sexual morality during these centuries Christendom probably
excelled Islam, though there was not much to choose; Christian monogamy,
however evaded in practice, kept the sexual impulse within bounds, and
slowly raised the status of woman, while Islam darkened the face of
woman with purdah and the veil. The Church succeeded in limiting
divorce; and homosexual di- versions seem never to have attained, even
in Renaissance Italy, the spread and freedom allowed them not in
Mohammedan law but in Moslem life. The Moslems seem to have been better
gentlemen than their Christian peers; they kept their word more
frequently, showed more mercy to the defeated, and were seldom guilty of
such brutality as marked the Christian capture of Jeru- salem in 1099.
Christian law continued to use ordeal by battle, water, or fire while
Moslem law was developing an advanced jurisprudence and an en- lightened
judiciary. The Mohammedan religion, less original than the He- brew,
less embracing in eclecticism than the Christian, kept its creed and
ritual simpler and purer, less dramatic and colorful, than the
Christian, and made less concession to the natural polytheism of
mankind. It resembled Protestantism in scorning the aid and play that
Mediterranean religion of- fered to the imagination and the senses; but
it bowed to popular sensualism in its picture of paradise. It kept
itself almost free from sacerdotalism, but fell into a narrow and
dulling orthodoxy just when Christianity was entering into the most
exuberant period of Catholic philosophy.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>342</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>The influence of Christendom on Islam was almost limited to religion
and war. Probably from Christian exemplars came Mohammedan mysticism,
monasticism, and the worship of the saints. The figure and story of
Jesus touched the Moslem soul, and appeared sympathetically in Moslem
poetry and art . 120</p>
<p>The influence of Islam upon Christendom was varied and immense. From
Islam Christian Europe received foods, drinks, drugs, medicaments,
armor, heraldry, art motives and tastes, industrial and commercial
articles and tech- niques, maritime codes and ways, and often the words
for these things — orange , lemon , sugar , syrup, sherbet, julep,
elixir, jar, azure, arabesque, mat- tress, sofa, muslin, satin, fustian,
bazaar, caravan, check, tariff, traffic, douane, magazine , risk, sloop,
barge, cable, admiral. The game of chess came to Europe from India via
Islam, and picked up Persian terms on the way; check- mate is from the
Persian shah mat — 11 the king is dead.” Some of our musical instruments
bear in their names evidence of their Semitic origin — lute, rebeck,
guitar, tambourine. The poetry and music of the troubadours came from
Moslem Spain into Provence, and from Moslem Sicily into Italy; and
Arabic descriptions of trips to heaven and hell may have shared in
forming The Di- vine Comedy. Hindu fables and numerals entered Europe in
Arabic dress or form. Moslem science preserved and developed Greek
mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, . and medicine, and
transmitted this Greek heritage, considerably enriched, to Europe; and
Arabic scientific terms — algebra, zero, cipher, azimuth, alembic,
zenith, almanac — still lie imbedded in European speech. Moslem medicine
led the world for half a millennium. Moslem phi- losophy preserved and
corrupted Aristotle for Christian Europe. Avicenna and Averroes were
lights from the East for the Schoolmen, who cited them as next to the
Greeks in authority.</p>
<p>The ribbed vault is older in Islam than in Europe , 121 though we
cannot trace the route by which it came into Gothic art. Christian spire
and belfry owed much to the minaret , 122 and perhaps Gothic window
tracery took a lead from the cusped arcading of the Giralda tower . 123
The rejuvenation of the ceramic art in Italy and France has been
attributed to the importation of Moslem potters in the twelfth century,
and to the visits of Italian potters tto Moslem Spain . 124 Venetian
workers in metal and glass, Italian bookbinders, Spanish armorers,
learned their techniques from Moslem artisans ; 125 and al- most
everywhere in Europe weavers looked to Islam for models and designs.
Even gardens received a Persian influence.</p>
<p>We shall see later by what avenues these influences came: through
com- merce and the Crusades; through a thousand translations from Arabic
into Latin; through the visits of scholars like Gerbert, Michael Scot,
and Adelard of Bath to Moslem Spain; through the sending of Christian
youths by their Spanish parents to Moslem courts to receive a knightly
education 12C — for the Moslem aristocrats were accounted “knights and
gentlemen, albeit</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) GRANDEUR AND DECLINE OF ISLAM 343</p>
<p>Moors”; 127 through the daily contact of Christians with Moslems in
Syria, Egypt, Sicily, and Spain. Every advance of the Christians in
Spain admitted a wave of Islamic literature, science, philosophy, and
art into Christendom. So the capture of Toledo in 1085 immensely
furthered Christian knowledge of astronomy, and kept alive the doctrine
of the sphericity of the earth. 128</p>
<p>Behind this borrowing smoldered an undying hate. Nothing, save bread,
is so precious to mankind as its religious beliefs; for man lives not by
bread alone, but also by the faith that lets him hope. Therefore his
deepest hatred greets those who challenge his sustenance or his creed.
For three centuries Christianity saw Islam advance, saw it capture and
absorb one Christian land and people after another, felt its
constricting hand upon Christian trade, and heard it call Christians
infidels. At last the potential conflict became actual: the rival
civilizations clashed in the Crusades; and the best of the East or West
slew the best of the West or East. Back of all medieval history lay this
mutual hostility, with a third faith, the Jewish, caught between the
main combatants, and cut by both swords. The West lost the Crusades, but
won the war of creeds. Every Christian warrior was expelled from the
Holy Land of Juda- ism and Christianity; but Islam, bled by its tardy
victory, and ravaged by Mongols, fell in turn into a Dark Age of
obscurantism and poverty; while the beaten West, matured by its effort
and forgetting its defeat, learned avidly from its enemy, lifted
cathedrals into the sky, wandered out on the high seas of reason,
transformed its crude new languages into Dante, Chau- cer, and Villon,
and moved with high spirit into the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The general reader will marvel at the length of this survey of
Islamic civi- lization, and the scholar will mourn its inadequate
brevity. Only at the peaks of history has a society produced, in an
equal period, so many illustrious men — in government, education,
literature, philology, geography, history, mathematics, astronomy,
chemistry, philosophy, and medicine — as Islam in the four centuries
between Harun al-Rashid and Averroes. Part of this brilliant activity
fed on Greek leavings; but much of it, above all in states- manship,
poetry, and art, was original and invaluable. In one sense this zenith
of Islam was a recovery of the Near East from Greek domination; it
reached back not only to Sasanian and Achaemenid Persia, but to the
Judea of Solo- mon, the Assyria of Ashurbanipal, the Babylonia of
Hammurabi, the Akkad of Sargon, the Sumeria of unknown kings. So the
continuity of history re- asserts itself: despite earthquakes,
epidemics, famines, eruptive migrations, and catastrophic wars, the
essential processes of civilization are not lost; some younger culture
takes them up, snatches them from the conflagration, car- ries them on
imitatively, then creatively, until fresh youth and spirit can enter the
race. As men are members of one another, and generations are mo- ments
in a family line, so civilizations are units in a larger whole whose
name is history; they are stages in the life of man. Civilization is
polygenetic — it is</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>the co-operative product of many peoples, ranks, and faiths; and no
one who studies its history can be a bigot of race or creed. Therefore
the scholar, though he belongs to his country through affectionate
kinship, feels himself also a citizen of that Country of the Mind which
knows no hatreds and no frontiers; he hardly deserves his name if he
carries into his study political prejudices, or racial discriminations,
