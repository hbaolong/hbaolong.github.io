<p>i 733- 8 7</p>
<p>I. THE ATHENS OF GERMANY</p>
<p>W HY did the supreme age of German literature make Weimar its</p>
<p>home? Germany had no one capital to concentrate her culture, as</p>
<p>France and England had, and no concentrated wealth to finance it.
Berlin and Leipzig had been weakened — Dresden had been almost destroyed
— by the Seven Years’ War; Hamburg gave its money first to opera, then
to the thea - ter. In 1774 Weimar, capital of the duchy of
Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, was a quiet little town of some 6,200 souls; even
after it had become famous Goethe spoke of it as “this small capital,
which, as people jokingly say, has ten thou - sand poets and a few
inhabitants.” 1 Was its glory ma de by great individuals?</p>
<p>From 1758 to 1775 Weimar was governed by a niece of Frederick the
Great, the vivacious Dowager Duchess Anna Amalie, who, at the age of
nineteen, had been widowed by the death of Duke Konstantin, and had be-
come regent for their one-year-old son Karl August. It was she who
opened a door between government and literature by inviting Wieland to
come and tutor her sons (1772). She was one of several cultivated women
who, under her lead, and till her death in 1807, stimulated poets,
dramatists, and historians with sex and praise. After 1776 she made her
home a salon, and there — though all spoke French as well — she
encouraged the use of German as a language of literature.</p>
<p>In 1775 the Weimar court included some twenty-two persons and their
servitors. The poet Count Christian zu Stolberg found a pleasant
informality there in that year of Goethe’s arrival. “The old Duchess
[then thirty -six] is the very personification of good sense, and yet
most agreeable and natural. The Duke is a wonderful lad and full of
promise; so is his brother. And many excellent people.” 2 In 1787
Schiller described “the Weimar ladies” as “very sensitive; there is
scarcely one of them that has not had an affaire de coeur. They all
strive to make conquests…. A quiet, scarcely perceptible gov- ernment
allows everyone to live, and to bask in the air and sunshine. If one is
disposed to gaiety, every opportunity is offered.” 3</p>
<p>Karl August assumed the government of the duchy on September 3, 1775,
at the age of eighteen. Shortly thereafter, having pensioned his
mistress, 4 he took a wife, Princess Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt, and
captured Goethe on the way. He hunted with fury, drove his carriage
wildly through the quiet town, and passed hurriedly from woman to woman;
but his impetuosity was checked by an intellect that slowly matured into
good judgment. He studied</p>
<p>55 2</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>and fostered agriculture and industry, cultivated the sciences,
helped litera- ture, and labored for the good of his principality and
its people. Hear Mme. de Stael, who toured Germany in 1803:</p>
<p>Of all the German principalities there is none that makes us feel
more than Weimar the advantages of a small state, when its sovereign is
a man of strong understanding, and is capable of endeavoring to please
all classes of his subjects without losing anything in their obedience….
The military talents of the Duke are universally respected, and his
lively and reflective conversation con- tinually brings to our
recollection that he was formed by the great Frederick. It is by his own
and his mother’s reputation that the most distinguished men of learning
have been attracted to Weimar. Germany, for the first time, has a
literary metropolis. 5</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WIELAND: 1733-75</li>
</ol>
<p>Christoph Martin Wieland is the least known, but perhaps the most
lov- able, of the four men who made Weimar’s fame. Almost all the
influences of the time played upon him and tuned his lyre in their turn.
Son of a pastor in Oberholzheim (near Biberach in Wiirttemberg), he was
nurtured in piety and theology. When he discovered poetry, he made the
virtuous Klopstock his ideal, and then turned to Voltaire for relief. At
nearby Warthausen he found the extensive library of Count von Stadion;
he plunged into French and English literature, and sloughed off so much
theology that in a romance, Don Sylvio von Rosalva (1764), he held up
his boyhood faith to ridicule. He published prose translations of twenty
plays by Shakespeare (1762-66), thereby giving Germany for the first
time a view of Shakespeare as a whole, and providing German playwrights
with an escape from the classic formula of French drama. Meanwhile
Winckelmann and others were spreading the Hellenic gospel; Wieland made
his own version of it, adopted a light epi- curean tone in Komische
Erzdhlungen ( Comic Tales, 1765), and made a fictitious Greek the
protagonist of his main prose work, Geschichte des Aga- thon ( 1 766- 67
). Lessing called it “the only novel for thinking men.” 6</p>
<p>In its wandering pages Wieland (aged thirty-three) proposed to
expound his philosophy of life, exemplified in the physical and
intellectual adventures of an Athenian of the Periclean age. “Our plan,”
said the preface, “required that our hero should be represented in a
variety of trials,” whose effect would be to educate a man in integrity
and wisdom without the use of religious incentives or supports. 7
Agathon (i.e., Good), young and handsome, resists the attempt of a
Delphic priestess to seduce him; instead he develops for the simple
maiden Psyche (Soul) a pure though passionate love. He enters poli-
tics, becomes disgusted by the factionalism of parties, denounces the
voters for their lack of principle, and is banished from Athens.
Wandering in the mountains of Greece, he comes upon a band of Thracian
women who are celebrating the feast of Bacchus with wild and sensual
dances. They mistake Agathon for Bacchus, and almost stifle him with
their embraces; he is rescued by a pirate band, which sells him as a
slave in Smyrna to Hippias, a Sophist</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>of the fifth century b.c. Wieland expounds the philosophy of the
Sophists with indignation:</p>
<p>The wisdom of which the Sophists made a profession was in quality, as
well as in effect, the exact opposite of that professed by Socrates. The
Sophists taught the art of exciting other men’s passions [through
oratory] ; Socrates in - culcated the art of controlling one’s own. The
former showed how to appear wise and virtuous, the latter how to be so.
The former encouraged the youth of Athens to assume control of the
state; the latter pointed out to them that it would take half their
lifetime to learn how to rule themselves. The Socratic philosophy took
pride in going without riches; the philosophy of the Sophists knew how
to acquire them. It was complaisant, prepossessing, versatile; it
glorified the great,… dallied with women, and flattered everybody who
paid for it. It was everywhere at home, a favorite at court, in the
boudoir, with the aristocracy, even with the priesthood, while Socrates’
doctrin es… would be pronounced unprofitable by the busy, insipid by the
idle, and dangerous by the devout. 8</p>
<p>Hippias, as Wieland pictures him, embodies all the ideas and vices of
the Sophists. He is a philosopher, but he has seen to it that he is also
a millionaire. He resolves to bring the upright Agathon to an epicurean
way of thought and life. The wisest policy, he argues, is to pursue
pleasant sensations, and “all pleasures are in reality sensual.” 9 He
laughs at those who deny themselves munda ne joys to gain heavenly
delights that may never materialize. “Who has ever seen those gods, and
those spiritual beings, whose existence it [re- ligion] asserts?” All
that is a trick the priests play upon us. 10 Agathon con - demns this
philosophy as ignoring the spiritual element in man and the needs of
social order. Hippias introduces him to the rich and lovely Danae,
encour- ages her to seduce him, and conceals from him Danae’s hetaera
past. She dances, and the grace of her body, added to the charm of her
conversation and the music of her voice, leads Agathon to offer her his
full but virtuous love. Danae spoils Hippias’ plot by returning
Agathon’s love in kind. She, who had passed through many arms, finds a
new experience and happiness in Aga- thon’s devotion. Tired of soulless
loves, she aspires to begin with Agathon a new and purer life. She buys
him from Hippias, frees him, and invites him to share her wealth.
Hippias, in revenge, reveals to Agathon Danae’s career as a courtesan.
Agathon takes ship to Syracuse.</p>
<p>There he gains such repute for wisdom and integrity that he becomes
chief minister to the dictator Dionysius. By this time he has
surrendered some of his idealism:</p>
<p>He did not now have as highflown conceptions of human nature as
before. Or, rather* he had come to know the infinite distance between
the metaphysi- cal man, of whom one thinks or dreams in speculative
solitude, or the natural man as he proceeds in crude simplicity from the
hands of the universal mother, and the artificial man whom society,
laws, opinions, needs, dependence, and continual struggle of his desires
with his circumstances, of his own advantage with the advantage of
others, and the consequent necessity of continual dis- simulation and
masking of his true intentions, have falsified, degraded, distorted, and
disguised, in a thousand unnatural and deceptive forms. He was no longer
the youthful enthusiast who imagined that it would be as easy to carry
out a</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>great undertaking as to conceive it. He had learned how little one
ought to ex- pect from others, how little one ought to count on their
co-operation, and (what is most important) how little one ought to trust
oneself…. He had learned that the most perfect plan is often the worst
[and] that in the moral world, as in the material, nothing moves in a
straight line; in short, that life is like a voyage, where the pilot
must adapt his course to wind and weather, where he is never sure that
he will not be delayed or drifted aside by contrary currents; and that
everything depends upon this: amid a thousand deviations from one’s
course, yet to hold one’s mind unbendingly fixed upon the port of
destination. 11</p>
<p>Agathon serves Syracuse well and accomplishes some reforms, but a
court cabal deposes him, and he retires to Tarentum. There he is
welcomed by his father’s old friend the Pythagorean philosopher and
scientist Archytas (fl. 400- 365 b.c.), who realizes Plato’s dream of a
philosopher-king. There Aga- thon finds his youthful love Psyche, but,
alas, she is married to Archytas’ son, and turns out to be Agathon’s
sister. However (with the magic wand of a novelist) Danae is brought
from Smyrna to Tarentum; she has abandoned her epicurean ways to live in
a demure modesty. Agathon, realizing that he had sinned in deserting
her, begs her forgiveness; she embraces him, but refuses marriage; she
has resolved to atone for the meandering morals of her past by living
her remaining years in continence. The story ends with Agathon in-
credibly content with sisters.</p>
<p>The book has a hundred faults. The structure is loose, the
coincidences are lazy evasions of artistry; the style is agreeable but
diffuse; in many paragraphs the subject avoids the predicate until it is
forgotten; a critic greeted the au- thor’s birthday by wishing him a
life as long as his sentences. Even so, The History of Agathon is one of
the major works of the Frederician age. Its conclusions indicated that
Wieland had reconciled himself with the world, and could now be trusted
to teach and tame stormy and stressful youths. In 1769 he was made
professor of philosophy at Erfurt. Thence, three years later, he issued
Der goldene Spiegel ( The Golden Mirror), which expressed his ideas on
education. Anna Amalie was charmed; she invited him to try his pedagogy
on her sons. He came, and spent the rest of his life in Weimar. In 1773
he founded Der teutsche Merkur ( The German Herald ), which under his
leadership was for a generation (1773-89) the most influential literary
review in Germany. He was the intellectual star of Weimar till Goethe
came; and when, in 1775, the dashing young author of Werther took the
city by storm, Wieland welcomed him without jealousy, and was to remain
his friend for thirty-six years.</p>

<p>From the time when he trod the streets of Frankfurt-am-Main as con-
sciously the grandson of its mayor, to his septuagenarian years when his
casual conversation made the renown of his Boswell Eckermann, Johann</p>
<p>55 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Wolfgang von Goethe ran a full gamut of experience, absorbing all
that life, love, and letters could give him, and returning it gratefully
in wisdom and art.</p>
<p>Frankfurt was a “free city,” dominated by merchants and fairs, but
also the imperially designated seat for the coronation of German kings
and Holy Roman emperors. In 1749 it contained 33,000 souls, nearly all
pious, well- behaved, and gemutlich. Goethe’s birthplace was a
substantial four -story house (destroyed by fire in 1944, rebuilt in
1951). His father, Johann Kaspar Goethe, was the son of a prosperous
tailor and innkeeper; he ruined his po- litical career by pride and
arrogance, and retired from the practice of law to a life of amateur
scholarship in his elegant library. In 1748 he married Katharina
Elisabeth, daughter of Johann Wolfgang Textor, Schultheiss or
Burgermeister of Frankfurt. Her son never forgot that through her he be-
longed to the untitled patriciate that had ruled the city for
generations. When he was seventy-eight he told Eckermann, “We Frankfurt
patricians always considered ourselves equal to the nobility; and when I
held in my hands the diploma of nobility [granted him in 1782], I had
nothing more, in my own opinion, than I had possessed long ago.” 12 He
felt that U n ur die Lumpe sind bescheideri ”— only rascals are modest.
13</p>
<p>He was the eldest of six children, of whom only he and his sister
Cornelia survived childhood; in those days much parentage was love’s
labor lost. It was not a happy household; the mother was of a kindly
nature, inclined to humor and poetry, but the father was a pedantic
disciplinarian who alienated his offspring by the harshness and
impatience of his temper. “With my fa - ther,” Goethe recalled, “there
could be no pleasant relation.” 14 Fr om him, as well as from experience
as a privy councilor, Goethe may have derived some- thing of the
stiffness that showed in his later life. From his mother he may have
taken his poetic spirit and his love of the drama. She built a
marionette theater in her home; her son never recovered from its
fascination.</p>
<p>The children received their first education from their father, then
from tutors. Wolfgang acquired a reading knowledge of Latin, Greek, and
Eng- lish, some Hebrew, and the ability to speak French and Italian. He
learned to play the harpsichord and the violoncello, to sketch and
paint, to ride and fence and dance. But he took life as his best
teacher. He explored all quarters of Frankfurt, including the
Judengasse; he ogled the pretty Jewish girls, visited a Jewish school,
attended a circumcision, formed some notion of Jew- ish holydays. 15 The
Frankfurt fairs, by bringing into the city exotic faces and goods, added
to his education; so did the French officers in the Goethe home during
the Seven Years’ War. In 1764 the fifteen -year-old boy saw the
coronation of Joseph II as King of the Romans; he sucked in every bit of
it, and spent twenty pages describing it in his autobiography. 16</p>
<p>At fourteen he had the first of the many love affairs that engendered
half of his poetry. He had already won a reputation for his facility in
writing verses. Some boys with whom he occasionally mingled asked him to
compose a poetic letter in the style of a girl to a youth; he did so
well that they had it delivered to a lovelorn member of the group as
coming from the object of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>his devotion. This lad wished to answer in kind but lacked wit and
rhymes; would Goethe compose a reply for him? Goethe consented, and in
gratitude the lover paid the expenses of an outing for the group to a
suburban inn. The waitress there was a lass in her teens, called
Margarete — Gretchen for short; Goethe gave that name to the heroine of
Faust. Perhaps because of the ro- mances he had read and the letters he
had written, he was in a mood to appreciate the charm of girlhood. “The
first propensities to love in an un - corrupted youth,” he wrote at
sixty, “take altogether a spiritual direction. Nature seems to desire
that one sex may by the senses perceive goodness and beauty in the
other. And so, by the sight of this girl, and by my strong in- clination
for her, a new world of the beautiful and the excellent was revealed to
me.” 17 He never l ost that world; one woman after another stirred his
sensitive spirit, almost always with reverence as well as desire; at the
age of seventy-three he fell in love with a girl of seventeen.</p>
<p>For a while he was too awed to speak to the charmer. “I went to
church for love of her, and… during the long Protestant service I gazed
my fill at her.” 18 He saw her again at her inn, seated, like another
Gretchen, at a spinning wheel. Now she took the initiative, and gaily
signed the second love letter that he had fabricated as from a girl.
Then one of the group, whom Goethe had recommended to his grandfather,
was caught falsifying bonds and wills; Wolfgang’s parents forbade him
further association with those boys; Gretchen moved to a distant town,
and Goethe never saw her again. He was much put out when he learned that
she had said, “I always treated</p>
<p>He was quite content now (1765) to leave Frankfurt and study law at
the University of Leipzig. Like any eager youth he read widely outside
of his assigned subjects. He had already, in his father’s library,
browsed in Bayle’s Dictionnaire historique et critique, with much damage
to his religious faith; “and as soon as I reached Leipzig I tried to
free myself altogether from my connec tion with the church.” 20 For a
time he delved into mysticism, alchemy, even magic; this too entered
Faust. He tried his hand at etching and wood- cuts, studied the picture
collection at Dresden, frequently visited the painter Oeser in Leipzig.
Through Oeser he became acquainted with the writings of Winckelmann;
through these, and Lessing’s Laokoon, he received his first infusions of
reverence for the classic style. He and other students were pre- paring
a hearty reception for Winckelmann at Leipzig when the news came that
Winckelmann had been murdered in Trieste ( 1768).</p>
<p>The sense of beauty was predominant in his approach to the world. In
re- ligion he liked only its colorful and dramatic sacraments. He did
not care for philosophy as written by philosophers, except Spinoza; he
shuddered at logic and fled from Kant. He loved drama, wrote a worthless
one at Leipzig, and composed poetry almost every day, even while
listening to lectures on law. The poems which he published as Das
Leipziger Liederbuch are in the style of Anacreon, playful, sometimes
erotic:</p>
<p>Yet I’m content, and full of joy,</p>
<p>If she’ll but grant her smile so sweet,</p>
<p>558</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Or if at table she’ll employ,</p>
<p>To pillow hers, her lover’s feet;</p>
<p>Give me the apple that she bit,</p>
<p>The glass, from which she drank, bestow,</p>
<p>And, when my kiss so orders it,</p>
<p>Her bosom, veiled till then, will show. 21</p>
<p>Was this merely wishful thinking? Apparently not. He had found in
Leip- zig a pretty head — Annette Schonkopf — who was willing to enter
at least the vestibule of love. She was the daughter of a wine merchant
who served a midday meal to students; Goethe ate there frequently, and
fell in desire with her. She returned his ardor with judicious reserve,
and allowed other men to be attentive to her; he grew jealous, and took
to spying on her; they quarreled and made up, quarreled and made up,
quarreled and parted. Even in these ecstasies he reminded himself that
he was the grandson of a Bur germeister , and that he had in him a
daimon — the urge and drive of an omnivorous genius that demanded
freedom for its full development to its own imperative des- tiny.
Annette accepted another suitor.</p>
<p>Goethe counted this a defe at, and tried to forget it in dissipation.
“I had lost her really, and the frenzy with which I revenged my fault
upon myself by assaulting in various frantic ways my physical nature, in
order to inflict some hurt on my moral nature, contributed very much to
the bodily maladies under which I lost some of the best years of my
life.” 22 He sank into melan - choly, suffered from nervous indigestion,
developed a painful tumor in the neck, and woke up one night with an
almost fatal hemorrhage. He left Leip- zig without taking his degree,
and returned to Frankfurt (September, 1768) to face paternal reproofs
and maternal love.</p>
<p>During his long convalescence he made the acquaintance of Susanne von
Klettenberg , an ailing, kindly Moravian Pietist. “Her serenity and
peace of mind never left her; she looked upon her sickness as a
necessary element of her transient earthly existence.” 23 He described
her, years later, with sym - pathy and skill in the “Confessions of a
Beautiful Soul” which he inserted into Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre , but
he recorded very debonairly her claims that his nervousness and
melancholy were due to his failure to reconcile him- self to God.</p>
<p>Now I had believed, from my youth upward, that I stood on very good
terms with my God — nay, I even fancied… that he might be in arrears to
me, as I was daring enough to think that I had something to forgive him.
This presumption was grounded on my infinite good will, to which, it
seemed to me, he should have given better assistance. It may be imagined
how often I got into disputes on this subject with my friends, which,
however, always terminated in the friendliest way. 24</p>
<p>Nevertheless he experienced stray moments of piety, even to attending
some sessions of the Moravian Brethren; but he was repelled by the
“mediocre intelligence” of these simple people, 25 and soon returned to
his casual com - bination of pantheistic faith and rationalistic
doubt.</p>
<p>In April, 1770, he departed for Strasbourg, hoping to get his law
degree. A fellow student described him (then twenty- one) as “a handsome
figure,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>559</p>
<p>with a magnificent forehead and great, flashing eyes,” but added,
“All would not be smooth sailing with this young man, for he seemed to
have a wild and unsettled air.” 26 Perhaps his long illness had unnerved
him; his “daimon” was too unsettling to let him gain stability; but what
youth with fire coursing in his blood can enjoy repose? When he stood
before the great cathedral he hailed it patriotically as not Catholic
but “German architecture, our archi - tecture, for the Italians can
boast of none like it, still less the French.” 27 (He had not yet seen
Italy or France.) “Alone I climbed to the highest peak of the tower,…
and ventured at that elevation to step out on a platform which measured
scarcely a square yard…. I inflicted this terror and tor- ture upon
myself so many times until the experience became a matter of
indifference to me.” 26 One of his professors noted that “Herr Goethe
behaved</p>
<p>A dozen new experiences served to feed his flame. He met Herder
several times during the latter’s stay in Strasbourg. Herder, five years
older, domi - nated these encounters; Goethe, in a modest interlude,
called himself a “planet” revolving around Herder’s sun. He was
disturbed by Herder’s dic - tatorial tendency, but was stimulated by him
to read old ballads, Macpher- son’s “Ossian,” and (in Wieland’s
translation) Shakespeare. But also he read Voltaire, Rousseau, and
Diderot. Besides pursuing his work in law, he took courses in chemistry,
anatomy, obstetrics… And he continued his study of women.</p>
<p>He felt their charm with all the keen sensitivity of a poet, all the
electric incandescence of youth. Forty-seven years later he told
Eckermann that he believed in a mysterious magnetic effect of one person
upon another, and most of all through difference of sex. 30 He was
stirred by the light and prancing walk of girls, by the music of their
voices and laughter, by the color and rustle of their dress; and he
envied the intimacy of the flower they sometimes wore in their corsage
or their hair. One after another of these magic creatures called to his
blood, grew in his imagination, and moved his pen. There had already
been Gretchen and Annette; soon there would be Lotte and Lili and
Charlotte; later Minna and Ulrike. But now, at Sesenheim (near
Strasbourg), there was the most appealing of them all, Friederike
Brion.</p>
<p>She was the younger daughter (nineteen in 1771) of the town pastor,
whom Goethe compared to Goldsmith’s virtuous Vicar of Wakefield. The
pages about Friederike in Goethe’s autobiography are the finest prose he
ever wrote. 31 Several times he rode out from Strasbourg to enjoy the
un- spoiled simplicity of this rural family. He took Friederike for long
walks, for she was most at home in the open air. She fell in love with
him, and gave him all that he asked. “I n a lonely place in the forest
we embraced each other with deep emotion, and gave each other the most
faithful assurance that each loved the other from the bottom of the
heart.” 32 Soon he was confessing to a</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>560</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>friend that “one is not happier by a hair’s breadth by attaining the
object of his wishes.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was writing, in Latin, his doctoral thesis, which
affirmed (like “Febronius”) the right of the state to be independent of
the church. It won the approval of the university faculty; he passed the
examinations, and on August 6, 1771, he received his degree as a
licentiate at law. The time had come to leave Strasbourg. He rode out to
Sesenheim to say goodbye to Friederike. “When from my horse I reached
her my hand, the tears stood in her eyes, and I felt very uneasy….
Having at last escaped the excitement of a farewell, I, in a quiet and
peaceful journey, pretty well regained my self- possession.” 33 Remorse
came later. “Gretchen had been taken away from me; Annette had left me;
now for the first time I was guilty. I had wounded the most lovely heart
to its very depths; and the period of a gloomy repentance — with the
absence of a refreshing love, to which I had become accustomed — was
most agonizing.” 34 It is sadly self -centered; but which of us, in the
trial and error of love, has not wounded one or two hearts before
winning one? Friederike died unmarried, April 3, 1813.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Gotz and Werther</li>
</ol>
<p>In Frankfurt the new licentiate grudgingly practiced law. He
visited</p>
<p>Darmstadt occasionally, and felt the influence of its cult of
sentiment. He was now in a strong reaction against France, against
French drama and its rigid rules, even against Voltaire. More and more
he relished Shakespeare, who had put the nature of man, lawful or
lawless, upon the stage. In this mood, and in the exuberant vigor of
youth, he was ripe for Sturm und Drang. He sympathized with its
rejection of authority, its exaltation of instinct over intellect, of
the heroic individual over the tradition-imprisoned masses. And so, in
1772-73, he wrote Gotzvon Berlichingen.</p>
<p>It was a remarkable performance for a lad of twenty-three: a drama
unit- ing war, love, and treachery in a story warm with zeal for
liberty, exuding vitality, and holding the interest from beginning to
end. Gotz was a knight whose right hand had been shot off in battle when
he was twenty-four ( 1 504) ; an iron hand had been attached to his arm,
and with it he wielded his sword as lethally as before. Refusing to
acknowledge any overlord but the Emperor, he became one of those “robber
barons” who, in the name of free - dom, claimed full authority on their
lands, even to pillaging wayfarers and waging private war. In 1 495
Emperor Maximilian I had issued an edict against private wars, under the
double penalty of ban by the Empire and excom- munication by the Church.
Gotz of the Iron Hand rejected the ban as con- travening traditional
rights, and the play turned at first on the struggle be- tween the rebel
knight and the Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. Goethe, loving women much more
than war, let the center of interest pass to Adelaide von Walldorf,
whose beauty and wealth fired a dozen men with reckless pas- sion. For
her Adelbert von Weislingen, another “free” knight, broke his alliance
with Gotz and his troth with Gotz’s sister Maria, and went over to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>561</p>
<p>he Bishop. Perhaps in Weislingen’s vacillating love Goethe remembered
his own unfaithfulness. He sent a copy of the play to Friederike by a
friend, saying, “Poor Friederike will feel somewhat consoled when she
sees that the faithless lover is poisoned.” 35</p>
<p>The author colored history to suit his drama; Gottfried von
Berlichingen was not so noble and magnanimous as Goethe’s Gotz; but such
emendations are poetic licenses, like tortured rhymes. Forgivable, too,
is the rough, wild speech which Goethe ascribed to his hero as echoing
virility. When the play was produced in Berlin (1774) Frederick the
Great condemned it as a “de - testable imitation” of the “barbarism”
that he, like Voltaire, saw in Shake - speare, and he called upon German
dramatists to seek their models in France. Herder at first agreed with
Frederick, and told Goethe, “Shakespeare has ruined you”; 36 but he sent
the published version to his friends with high praise: “You have hours
of enchantment before you. There is an uncommon degree of authentic
German power, depth, and sincerity in the piece, though now and then it
is merely an intellectual exercise.” 37 The younger generation</p>
<p>In May, 1772, the young advocate had to go on legal business to
Wetzlar, seat of the Imperial Appellate Court. Not at all absorbed in
law, he wandered through fields, woods, and boudoirs, drawing, writing,
absorbing. In Wetzlar he met Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, poet and mystic,
and Georg Christian Kest- ner, a notary whom Goethe described as
“distinguished by a calm and equable demeanor, clearness of view,…
serene and tireless activity,” 39 and so confident of advancement that
he was already engaged to marry. Kestner described Goethe
magnanimously:</p>
<p>Twenty-three years old, the only son of a very wealthy father.
According to his father’s intention he was to practice law at the court
here; according to his own he was to study Homer and Pindar and whatever
else his genius, his taste, and his heart should inspire…. Indeed, he
has true genius, and is a man of character. He possesses an imagination
of extraordinary vividness, and ex- presses himself in images and
similes… His feelings are violent, but he is usually master of them. His
convictions are noble. He is quite free from preju- dice, and acts as he
likes without caring whether it pleases others, or is the fashion, or is
permissible. All compulsion is hateful to him. He loves children, and
can play with them for hours…. He is a quite remarkable man. 40</p>
<p>On June 9, 1772, at a country dance, Goethe met Kestner’s betrothed,
Charlotte Buff. The next day he visited her, and found a new charm in
womanhood. “Lotte,” then twenty, was the eldest sister in a family of
eleven. The mother was dead, the father was busy earning a living; Lotte
served as</p>
<p>562</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>mother to the brood. She not only had the bright gaiety of a healthy
girl, she had also the attractiveness of a young woman who, simply but
neatly dressed, performed the duties of her place with competence,
affection, and good cheer. Goethe soon fell in love with her, for he
could not remain long with- out some feminine image warming his
imagination. Kestner saw the situation, but, sure of his possession,
showed an amiable tolerance. Goethe allowed himself almost the
privileges of a rival wooer, but Lotte always checked him, and reminded
him that she was engaged. Finally he asked her to choose be- tween them;
she did, and Goethe, his pride only momentarily shaken, left Wetzlar the
next day (September 1 1 ). Kestner remained his loyal friend till
death.</p>
<p>Before returning to Frankfurt Goethe stopped at Ehrenbreitstein on
the Rhine, the home of Georg and Sophie von La Roche. Sophie had two
daugh- ters, “of whom the eldest,” Maximiliane, “soon particularly
attracted me…. It is a very pleasant sensation when a new passion begins
to stir in us before the old one is quite extinct. Thus, when the sun is
setting, one likes to see the moon rise on the op posite side.” 41
Maximiliane, however, married Peter Brentano, and bore a lively daughter
Bettina, who fell in love with Goethe thirty-five years later. Goethe
resigned himself to Frankfurt and law. Not quite, for at times he
thought of suicide.</p>
<p>Among a considerable collection of weapons I possessed a handsome,
well- polished dagger. This I laid every night by my bed, and before
extinguishing the candle I tried whether I could succeed in plunging the
sharp point a cou- ple of inches deep into my heart. Since I could never
succeed in this, I at last laughed myself out of the notion, threw off
all hypochondriacal fancies, and re- solved to live.</p>
<p>To be able to do this with cheerfulness I was obliged to solve a
literary problem, by which all that I had felt… should be reduced to
words. For this purpose I collected the elements which had been at work
in me for a few years; I rendered present to my mind the cases which had
most affected and tormented me; but nothing would come to a definite
form. I lacked an event, a fable, in which they could be seen as a
whole. 42</p>
<p>A fellow advocate at Wetzlar provided the amalgamating event. On Oc-
tober 30, 1772, Wilhelm Jerusalem, having borrowed a pistol from
Kestner, kil led himself in despair over his love for the wife of a
friend. “All at once, [when] I heard the news of Jerusalem’s death,”
Goethe recalled, “… the plan of Werther was formed, and the whole ran
together from all sides.” 43 Perhaps so, but it was not until fifteen
months later that he began to write the book. Meanwhile he carried on
with Maximiliane Brentano — who had moved with her husband to Frankfurt
— a flirtation so persistent that the hus- band protested, and Goethe
withdrew.</p>
<p>A variety of abortive literary projects distracted him. He dallied
with the idea of retelling the story of the Wandering Jew; he planned to
have him visit Spinoza, and to show that Satan, to all appearances, was
triumphing over Christ in Christendom; 44 but he wrote only ten pages of
Der ewige Jude. He composed some satires on Jacobi, Wieland, Herder,
Lenz, and Lavater, but managed to win their friendship nevertheless. He
contributed to Lavater’s</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>Physiognomische Fragmente, and allowed him to physiognomize his head,
with flattering results: “Intelligence is here, with sensibility to
kindle it,” judged the Swiss. “Observe the energetic brow,… the eye so
swiftly penetrating, searching, enamored,… and the nose, in itself
enough to pro- claim the poet…. With the virile chin, the well-opened
vigorous ear — who could question the genius in this head?” 45 — and who
could live up to such a cephalogram? Jacobi thought it could be done,
for, after visiting Goethe in July, 1773, he described him in a letter
to Wieland as “from head</p>
<p>At last, in February, 1774, Goethe wrote the book that gave him a
Euro- pean renown — Die Leiden des jungen Werthers. He had thought of it
so long, had so long rehearsed it in brooding and fancy, that now he
dashed it off, he tells us, “in four weeks…. I isolated myself
completely, I forbade the visits of my friends.” 47 Fifty years later he
said to Eckermann, “That was a creation which I, like the pelican, fed
with the blood of my own heart.” 48 He killed Werther to give himself
peace.</p>
<p>He was inspired in making the book brief. He used the letter form,
partly in imitation of Richardson’s Clarissa and Rousseau’s Julie,
partly because it lent itself to the expression and analysis of emotion,
and perhaps because in that form he could use some of the letters he had
written from Wetzlar to his sister Cornelia or to his friend Merck. He
shocked Charlotte and Kestner by giving her actual name, Lotte, to the
object of a love obviously describing Goethe’s passion for Kestner’s
bride. Kestner became “Albert,” and was favorably portrayed. Even the
meeting at the dance, and the morrow’s visit, were in the story as they
had been in fact. “Since that day sun, moon, and stars can go calmly
about their business, but I am conscious neither of day nor of night,
and the whole world around me is fading away…. I have no more prayers to
say except to her.” 49 Werther is not quite Goethe: he is more
sentimental, more given to tears and gushing words and
self-commiseration. In order to lead the narrative to its tragic
denouement, Werther had to be changed from Goethe to Wilhelm Jerusalem.
The final touches echo his- tory: Werther, like Jerusalem, borrows
Albert’s pistol for his suicide, and Lessing’s Emilia Galotti lies on
his desk as he dies. “No clergyman escorted him” to his grave.</p>
<p>The Sorrows of the Young Werther (1774) was an event in the history
of literature and of Germany. It expressed and promoted the romantic
element in Sturm und Drang, as Gotz von Berlichingen had expressed the
heroic. Re- bellious youth acclaimed it with praise and imitation; some
dressed in blue coat and buff vest like Werther, some wept like Werther;
some committed suicide as the only fashionable thing to do. Kestner
protested at the invasion of his privacy, but was soon appeased, and we
are not told that Charlotte complained when Goethe told her, “Your name
is uttered in reverence by thousands of adoring lips.” 50 The German
clergy did not join in the applause. A Hamburg preacher denounced
Werther as an apology for suicide; Pastor Goeze, Lessing’s enemy,
blasted the book, and Lessing condemned it for its</p>
<p>5 6 4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>sentimentality and lack of classic restraint. 51 At a public dinner
the Reverend J. C. Hasenkampf censured Goethe to his face for “that
wicked piece of writing,” and added, “May God improve your perverse
heart!” Goethe de - flated him with a soft answer: “Remember me in your
prayers.” 52 Mean - while the little book swept through Europe in a
dozen translations, three in France in three years; now for the first
time France admitted that Germany had a literature.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Young Atheist</li>
</ol>
<p>The clergy had some excuse for worrying about Goethe, for he was in
this stage openly hostile to the Christian Church. “He reveres the
Christian</p>
<p>prays.” 53 Goethe was especially averse to the Christian emphasis on
sin and contrition; 54 he preferred to sin without remorse. He wrote to
Herder (about</p>
<ol start="1774" type="1">
<li>: “If only the whole teaching of Christ were not such bilge that I,
as a human being, a poor limited creature of desires and needs, am
infuriated by it!” 55 He planned a drama on Prometheus as a symbol of
man defying the gods; he wrote little more than a prologue, which
shocked Jacobi and pleased Lessing. What remains of it is the most
radical of Goethe’s antireligious out - bursts. Prometheus speaks:</li>
</ol>
<p>Cover thy heaven, Zeus, with cloudy mist,</p>
<p>And disport yourself ^like a child who cuts off thistle heads —</p>
<p>On oaks and mountain peaks!</p>
<p>My earth you must still let stand,</p>

<p>You nourish your majesty with difficulty</p>
<p>From sacrifices and votive prayers,</p>
<p>And it would starve,</p>
<p>Were not children and beggars such hopeful fools.</p>
<p>When I was but a child, and knew not what to think,</p>

<p>Here sit I, forming men after my image,</p>
<p>A race that may be like me,</p>

<p>And to disdain you, as I do.</p>
<p>From this nadir of proud atheism Goethe moved slowly to the gentler
pantheism of Spinoza. Lavater reported that “Goethe told us many things
about Spinoza and his writings…. He had been an extremely just, upright,
poor man…. All modern deists had drawn primarily from him…. His
correspondence, Goethe added, was the most interesting in the whole
world as concerned uprightness an d love of humanity.’’ 56 Forty -two
years later Goethe told Karl Zelter that the writers who had most
influenced him were Shakespeare, Spinoza, and Linnaeus. 57 On June 9,
1785, he acknowledged the receipt of Jacobi’s book On the Teachings of
Spinoza; hi s discussion of Jacobi’s interpretation reveals considerable
study of the Jewish philosopher - saint. “Spinoza,” he wrote, “does not
demonstrate the existence of God; he demonstrates that existence [the
matter-mind reality] is God. Let others call him an atheist on this
account; I am inclined to call him and praise him as most godly, and
even most Christian…. I receive from him the most wholesome influences
upon my thinking and acting.” 58 In his autobiography Goethe remarked on
his reply to Jacobi:</p>
<p>Happily I had already prepared myself,… having in some degree appro-
priated the thoughts and mind of an extraordinary man…. This mind, which
had worked upon me so decisively, and was destined to affect so deeply
my whole mode of thought, was Spinoza. After looking through the world
in vain to find a means of development for my strange nature, I at last
fell upon the Ethics of this philosopher…. I found in it a sedative for
my passions; and a free, wide view over the sensible and moral world
seemed to open before me…. I was never so presumptuous as to think that
I understood perfectly a man who… raised himself, through mathematical
and rabbinical studies, to the highest reach of thought, and whose name,
even at this day, seems to mark the limit of all speculative efforts.
59</p>
<p>He gave added warmth to his Spinozistic pantheism by the intensity
with which he loved nature. It was not merely that he found delight in
bright fields, or mystic woods, or plants and flowers multiplying with
such exuber- ant diversity; he also loved nature’s sterner moods, and
liked to fight his way</p>
<p>Nature! By her we are surrounded and encompassed — unable to step out
of her, and unable to enter deeper into her. She receives us,
unsolicited and un- warned, into the circle of her dance, and hurries
along with us, till we are ex- hausted, and drop out of her arms….</p>
<p>She creates ever new forms; what now is, was never before; what was,
comes not again; all is new, and yet always the old….</p>
<p>She seems to have contrived everything for individuality, but cares

<p>for individuals. She is ever building, ever destroying, and her
workshop is in- accessible…</p>
<p>She has thought, and is constantly meditating; not as a man, but as
nature. She has an all-embracing mind of her own; no one can penetrate

<p>She lets every child tinker with her, every fool pass judgment on

<p>She has placed me here, she will lead me away. I trust myself to her.
She may do as she likes with me. She will not hate her work. 60</p>
<p>In December, 1774, Duke Karl August stopped at Frankfurt en route to
seek a bride at Karlsruhe. He had read and admired Gotz von
Berlichingen; he invited the author to meet him. Goethe came and made a
favorable impres- sion; the Duke wondered might not this handsome and
mannerly genius be an ornament of the Weimar court. He had to hurry on,
but asked Goethe to meet him again on his return from Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>Goethe spoke often of destiny, too little of chance. He might have
an- swered that it was destiny, not chance, that brought him to the
Duke, and that it turned him from the loveliness of Lili Schonemann to
Weimar’s un - known perils and opportunities. Lili was the only daughter
of a rich mer- chant in Frankfurt. Goethe, now a social lion, was
invited to a reception in her home. She performed brilliantly at the
piano; Goethe leaned over a corner of it and drank in her sixteen-year-
old charms as she played. “I was sensible of feeling an attractive power
of the gentlest kind…. We grew into the habit of seeing each other…. We
were now necessary to each other…. An irresistible longing dominated me”
61 — so rapidly can that famous fever rise, blown up by a poet’s
sensitivity. Before* he quite realized what it meant, he was officially
engaged (April, 1775). Then Lili, thinking him securely captured,
coquetted with others. Goethe saw and fumed.</p>
<p>Just at this time two friends, Counts Christian and Friedrich zu
Stolberg, came to Frankfurt on their way to Switzerland. They suggested
that Goethe join them. His father urged him to go, and to continue on
into Italy. “With some intimation, but without leavetaking, I separated
myself from Lili.” 62 He started out in May, 1775; at Karlsruhe he met
the Duke again, and was definitely invited to Weimar. He went on to
Zurich, where he met Lavater and Bodmer. He climbed St. Gotthard, and
looked longingly at Italy. Then the image of Lili regained ascendancy;
he left his companions, turned home- ward, and in September had Lili in
his arms. But, back in his room, he felt again his old dread of marriage
as imprisonment and stagnation. Lili resented his vacillation; they
agreed to break off their betrothal; in 1776 she married Bernhard von
Tiirckheim.</p>
<p>The Duke, briefly at Frankfurt on his way back from Karlsruhe,
offered to send a coach to take Goethe to Weimar. Goethe consented, made
his arrangements, and waited for the appointed day. The coach did not
come. Had he been played with and deceived? After some days of fretful
delay, he started out for Italy. But at Heidelberg the promised coach
caught up with</p>

<p>him; the Duke’s emissary made explanations and apologies; Goethe
accepted</p>

<li>herder: 1744-76</li>
</ol>
<p>Hardl y a month after Goethe’s arrival at Weimar he passed on to the
Duke, with warm approval, Wieland’s suggestion that the vacant post of
Generalsuperintendent of the clergy and the schools of the duchy be
offered to Johann Gottfried Herder. The Duke agreed.</p>
<p>Born at Mohrungen in East Prussia (August 25, 1744), Herder was, by
geography and Baltic mists, akin to Immanuel Kant. His father was a poor
schoolmaster and Pietist cantor, so that the boy had all the uses of
adversity. From the age of five he suffered from a fistula in the right
eye. Soon required to add to the family income, he left school to become
secretary and servant to Sebastian Trescho, who made «; good living by
writing handbooks of piety. Trescho had a library, which Johann
consumed. At eighteen he was sent to Konigsberg to have the fistula
removed, and to study medicine at the university. The operation failed,
and the dissection classes so upset the youth’s stomach that he turned
from medicine to theology.</p>
<p>He formed a friendship with Hamann, who taught him English, using
Hamlet as a text; Herder learned almost all the play by heart. He
attended Kant’s lectures on geography, astronomy, and Wolff’s
philosophy; Kant liked him so much that he excused him from the fees
charged for the courses. Herder supported himself by translating and
tutoring, and from the age of twenty to twenty-five he taught in the
cathedral school at Riga. At twenty- one he was ordained a Lutheran
minister; at twenty-two he became a Free- mason; 63 at twenty-three he
was appointed adjutant pastor in two churches near Riga. He broke into
print at twenty-two with a volume Vber die neuere deutsche Litteratur;
he added a second and third tome to it a year later; Kant, Lessing,
Nikolai, and Lavater were impressed by the young author’s learning, and
they commended his appeal for a national literature</p>
<p>Herder anticipated the Werther fashion by falling hopelessly in love
with a married woman; he suffered so severe a physical and mental
depression that he was given a leave of absence with promise of
re-employment at a better salary on his return. He borrowed money, left
Riga (May 23, 1769), and never saw it again. He went by ship to Nantes,
stayed there four months, and passed to Paris. He met Diderot and
d’Alembert, but he was never won to the French Enlightenment.</p>
<p>His bent was aesthetic rather than intellectual. In Paris he began to
collect primitive poetry, and found in it more delight than in the
classic literature of France. He read Macpherson’s “Ossian” in a German
translation, and pronounced these skillful imitations superior to most
modern English verse after Shakespeare. He began in 1769 those essays in

<p>cism which he called Wdldchen (groves); three volumes of these he
pub- lished in his lifetime as Kritische W aider ( Critical Woods). In
February, 1770, he spent fourteen days in fruitful contact with Lessing
at Hamburg. Then he joined the Prince of Holstein-Gottorp as tutor and
companion, and traveled with him through western Germany. In Cassel he
met Rudolph Raspe, professor of archaeology and soon to be author of
Baron Mun- chausen’s Narrative of His Marvelous Travels and Campaigns in
Russia (1785). Raspe had called the attention of Germany to Thomas
Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry in the year of its appearance
(1765). Herder was strengthened in his belief that poets should abandon
the Win- ckelmann-Lessing call for imitation of Greek classics, and
should rather cling to the popular sources of their nation’s traditions
in folk poetry and ballad history.</p>
<p>Passing with the Prince to Darmstadt, Herder met its “Circle of Sensi
- tives,” took kindly to their exaltation of sentiment, and especially
appreci - ated the sentiments of Caroline Flachsland, the orphaned
sister-in-law of Privy Councilor Andreas von Hesse. He was invited to
preach in a local church. She heard him and was moved; they walked in
the woods; they touched hands and he was moved. He proposed. She warned
him that she lived on the charity of her sister, and could bring him no
dowry; he replied that he was heavily in debt, had on ly the dimmest
prospects, and was com- mitted to accompany the Prince. They pledged
each other no formal troth, but agreed to love each other by mail. On
April 27, 1770, his party left for Mannheim.</p>
<p>When it reached Strasbourg Herder, though he longed to see Italy,
left the Prince. The fistula in his lachrymal gland blocked the tear
duct to the nostril, causing constant pain. Dr. Lobstein, professor of
gynecology at the university, promised that an operation would clear up
the matter in three weeks. Herder submitted, without anesthetics, to
repeated drilling of a chan- nel through the bone to the nasal passage.
Infection set in, and for almost six months Herder was confined to his
hotel room, discouraged by the fail- ure of the operation, and gloomy
with doubts of his future. It was in this mood of suffering and
pessimism that he met Goethe (September 4, 1770). “I was able to be
present at the operation,” Goethe recalled, “and to be serv - iceable in
many wa ys.” 64 He was inspired by Herder’s view that poetry arose
instinctively among the people, not from “a few refined and cultivated
men.” 65 When Herder left, his funds quite exhausted, Goethe “borrowed a
sum of money for him,” which Herder later repaid.</p>
<p>Reluctantly he accepted an invitation from Count Wilhelm zu Lippe,
ruler of the little principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, in northwest
Germany, to serve him as court preacher and consistory president in his
modest capital, Biickeburg. In April, 1771, Herder left Strasbourg,
visited Caroline at Darm- stadt and Goethe at Frankfurt, and reached
Biickeburg on the twenty- eighth. He found the Count an “enlightened
despot” of a rigid disciplinarian cast. The town was provincial in
everything but music, which was well sup- plied by Johann Christoph
Friedrich Bach. Herder resigned himself to isola-</p>

<p>569</p>
<p>ion from the mainstream of German thought; but the books that he
issued from his foot of earth powerfully affected that stream, and
shared in forming the literary ideas of Sturm und Drang. He assured
German authors that if they were to seek their inspiration in the roots
of the nation and the life of the people they would in time outshine all
that the French had done. In philosophy and science this prediction was
verified.</p>
<p>His Abhandlung iiber den Ur sprung der Sprache ( Treatise on the
Origin of Language, 1772) won the prize that had been offered by the
Berlin Acad- emy in 1770. While sincerely professing piety, Herder
rejected the notion that language was a special creation of God; it was
a human creation, natu- rally resulting from the processes of sensation
and thought. Originally, he suggested, language and poetry were one as
expressions of emotion, and verbs, expressing action, were the first
“part of speech.” — Another volume, Auch eine Philosophic der Geschichte
( One More Philosophy of History,</p>
<p>1774), presented history as “the natural philosophy of successive
events.” Each civilization was a biological entity, a plant with its own
birth, youth, maturity, decline, and death; it should be studied from
the standpoint of its own time, without moral prepossessions based on
another environment and age. Like the Romantics in general, Herder
admired the Middle Ages as the age of imagination and feeling, of
popular poetry and art, of rural simplicity and peace; by contrast,
post-Reformation Europe was the worship of the state, of money, urban
luxury, artificiality, and vice. He criticized the En- lightenment as
the idolatry of reason, and compared it unfavorably with the classic
cultures of Greece and Rome. In all the historic process Herder, like
Bossuet, saw the hand of God, but sometimes the eloquent pastor forgot
his theology, and thought that “the general change of the world was
guided far less by man than by a blind fate.” 66</p>
<p>His loneliness moved him, despite his meager income, to ask Caroline
and her brother-in-law might he come and make her his wife. They
consented, and the lovers were married at Darmstadt on May 2, 1773. They
returned to Biickeburg, and Herder borrowed money to make his rectory a
pleasant home for his mate. She gave him a lifelong service and
devotion. Through her a coolness that had developed between Herder and
Goethe was ended, and when Goethe found himself in a position to
recommend the pastor to a more remunerative post, he was happy to do it.
On October 1, 1776, Herder and Caroline arrived in Weimar, and moved
into the house that Goethe had prepared for them. Now only one member
had yet to come of the quadrum- virate that was to make Weimar’s
fame.</p>
<p>V. SCHILLER’S WANDER] AH RE: 1 759 -87</p>
<p>Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller was born on November 10, 1759, at
Marbach in Wvirttemberg. His mother was the daughter of the landlord of
the Lion Inn. The father was a surgeon — later a captain — in the army
of Duke Karl Eugen; he moved about with his regiment, but his wife
stayed mostly</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>in Lorch or Ludwigsburg. In those towns Friedrich received his
education. His parents intended him for the ministry, but were persuaded
by the Duke to send him, aged fourteen, to the Karlsschule at
Ludwigsburg (later at Stuttgart), where the sons of officers were
prepared for law, medicine, or an army career. The discipline was
rigorously military; the studies were uncon- genial to a lad almost
femininely sensitive. Schiller reacted by imbibing all the rebel ideas
that he could find, and pouring them (1779-80) into Die Rtiuber ( The
Robbers ), a drama that surpassed Gotz von Berlichingen as an expression
of Sturm und Drang.</p>
<p>In 1780 Schiller was graduated in medicine, and became surgeon to a
regi- ment at Stuttgart. His salary was slight; he lived in one room
with Lieutenant Kapf; they prepared their own meals, chiefly of sausage,
potatoes, and let- tuce, and, on gala occasions, wine. He tried hard to
be a man in the soldier’s sense of battle, beer, and bordellos; he
visited the prostitutes who attended the camp; 67 but he had no taste
for vulgarity, for he idealized women as sacred mysteries to be
approached with trembling reverence. His landlady, Luise Vischer, was a
thirty-year-old widow, but when she played the harp- sichord “my spirit
left its mortal clay,” 68 and he wished he could be “fixed forever to
thy lips,… thy breath to drink,” 69 — a novel way of suicide.</p>
<p>He tried in vain to find a publisher for The Robbers; failing, he
saved and borrowed, and paid for its printing himself (1781). Its
success aston- ished even the twenty-two-year- old author. Carlyle
thought it marked “an era in the Literatur e of the World;” 70 but
respectable Germany was shocked to find that the play left hardly any
aspect of current civilization undamned. Schiller’s preface pointed out
that the denouement showed the grandeur of conscience and the wickedness
of revolt.</p>
<p>Karl Moor, elder son of the aging Count Maximilian von Moor, is espe-
cially beloved by his father for his idealism and generosity, and is
therefore envied and hated by his brother Franz. Karl goes off to the
University of Leipzig, and imbibes the rebellious sentiments that were
seething in the youth of Western Europe. Dunned for his debts, he
denounces the heartless money- grubbers who “damn the Sadducee who fails
to come to church reg - ularly, although their own devotion consists in
reckoning up their usurious gains at the very altar.” 71 He loses all
faith in the existing social order, joins a robber band, becomes its
captain, pledges to be loyal to it till death, and comforts his
conscience by playing Robin Hood. One of the band describes him:</p>
<p>He does not commit murder, as we do, for the sake of plunder, and as
to money… he seems not to care a straw for it; his third of the booty,
which belongs to him of right, he gives to orphans, or to support
promising youths at college. But should he happen to get into his
clutches a country squire who grinds his peasants like cattle, or some
gold-laced villain who warps the law to his own purposes,… or any other
chap of that kidney — then, my boy, he is in his element, and rages like
a very devil. 72</p>
<p>Karl denounces the clergy as sycophants of power and secret
worshipers of Mammon; “the best of them would betray the whole Trinity
for ten shek - els.” 78</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>571</p>
<p>Meanwhile Franz arranges that a false message should announce to the
Count that Karl is dead. Franz becomes heir to the estate, and offers
mar- riage to Amelia, who loves Karl alive or dead. Franz poisons his
father, and quiets his qualms with atheism: “It has not yet been proved
that there is an eye above this earth to take account of what passes on
it…. There is no God.” 74 Karl hears of his brother’s crimes, leads his
band to the paternal</p>
<p>All this, of course, is nonsense. The characters and events are
incredible, the style is bombastic, the speeches unbearable, the
conception of woman romantically ideal. But it is powerful nonsense.
There is in nearly all of us a secret sympathy with those who defy the
law; we too sometimes feel our- selves “squeezed into stays” by the
thousands of laws and ordinances that</p>
<p>Baron Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg offered to present it in the Na-
tionaltheater at Mannheim if Schiller would provide a happier ending. He
did: Moor marries Amelia instead of killing her. Without asking
permission of Duke Karl Eugen, his military commander, Schiller slipped
away from Stuttgart to attend the premiere on January 13, 1782. People
came from Worms, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, and elsewhere to see the
performance; Au- gust Iffland, one of the finest actors of that
generation, played Karl; the audi- ence shouted and sobbed its approval;
no other German drama had ever re- ceived such an ovation; 76 it was a
high-water mark in Sturm und Drang. After the play Schiller was feted by
the actors and courted by a Mannheim publisher; he found it hard to
return to Stuttgart and resume his life as regimental surgeon. In May he
escaped again to Mannheim to see another performance of The Robbers, and
to discuss with Dalberg plans for a second drama. Back again with his
regiment, he received a reproof from the Duke, and was forbidden to
write any more plays.</p>
<p>He could not accept such a prohibition. On September 22, 1782, accom-
panied by a friend, Andreas Streicher, he fled to Mannheim. He offered
Dalberg a new play — Die Verschworung des Fiesko zu Genua ( The Con-
spiracy of Fiesko at Genoa). He read it to the actors; they pronounced
it a sad decline from The Robbers-, Dalberg thought he might produce the
play if Schiller revised it; Schiller spent weeks on this task; Dalberg
rejected the result. Schiller found himself penniless. Streicher spent,
in supporting him,</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>he money he had saved to study music in Hamburg. When this ran out,
Schiller welcomed an invitation to stay in Bauerbach in a cottage owned
by Frau Henrietta von Wolzogen. There he wrote a third play, Kabale und
Liebe ( Intrigue and Love), and fell in love with Fraulein Lotte von,
Wolzo- gen, aged sixteen. She preferred a rival. Meanwhile Fiesko,
published, had a good sale. Dalberg repented, and sent Schiller an
invitation to be resident playwright for the Mannheim theater at three
hundred florins per year. He agreed (July, 1783).</p>
<p>Despite many unpaid debts, and one serious illness, Schiller,
modestly lodged in Mannheim, had a year of precarious bliss. Fiesko
received its pre- miere January 11, 1784; the incredibly happy ending
which Dalberg had insisted upon spoiled it, and the play aroused no
enthusiasm. But Kabale und Liebe was better constructed, had fewer
orations, and showed a growing sense of the theater; some have
pronounced it, from the theatrical point of view, the best of all German
tragedies. 77 After the initial performance (April 15, 1784) the
audience gave it such tumultuous applause that Schiller rose from his
seat in a box and bowed.</p>
<p>His happiness was extreme and brief. He was not temperamentally fit
to deal with actors, who were almost as high-strung as himself; he
judged their acting strictly, and reproved them for not accurately
memorizing their lines. 78 He was unable to finish a third play, Don
Carlos , by the stipulated time. When his contract as Theaterdichter
neared expiration in September, 1784, Dalberg refused to renew it.
Schiller had saved nothing, and was again faced with destitution and
impatient creditors.</p>
<p>About this time he published some letters, Fhilosophische Brief e,
which indicate that religious doubts were added to his economic
embarrassments. He could not accept the old theology, and yet his poetic
spirit was revolted by such materialistic atheism as d’Holbach had
expressed in Systeme de la nature (1770). He could no longer pray, but
he envied those who could, and he described with a sense of great loss
the comfort that religion was bringing to thousands of souls in
suffering, grief, and the nearness of death. 79 He kept his faith in
free will, immortality, and an unknowable God, basing all, like Kant, on
the moral consciousness. And he expressed memorably the ethic of Christ:
“When I hate, I take something from myself; when I love, I become richer
by what I love. To pardon is to receive a property that has been lost.
Misanthropy is a protracted suicide.” 80</p>
<p>Amid these complications Christian Gottfried Korner brought into
Schil- ler’s life one of the finest friendships in literary history. In
June, 1784, he sent to Schiller from Leipzig a letter of warm
admiration, accompanied by portraits of himself, his fiancee Minna
Stock, her sister Dora, and Dora’s fiance Ludwig Huber, and a wallet
that Minna had embroidered. Korner had been bom in 1756 (three years
before Schiller) to the pastor of that same Thomaskirche where Bach a
generation earlier had conducted so much enduring music. The youth
became a licentiate in law at the age of twenty- one, and was now
counselor to the Upper Consistory in Dresden. Schiller, pressed with
troubles, delayed reply till December 7. Korner answered:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>ROADS TO WEIMAR</p>
<p>573</p>
<p>“We offer you our friendship without reserve. Come to us as soon as
pos - sible.” 81</p>
<p>Schiller hesitated. He had made friendships in Mannheim, and had had
several amours, especially (1784) with Charlotte von Kalb, who had been
married only a year before. At Darmstadt, in December, 1784, he met Duke
Karl August of Saxe- Weimar, read to him the first act of Don Carlos ,
and received the title of Rat, or honorary councilor; but no offer came
of a place in the Weimar firmament. He decided to accept Korner ’s
invitation to Leip - zig. On February 10, 1785, he sent to his unknown
admirer an emotional appeal that shows him near the breaking point:</p>
<p>While half of Mannheim is rushing to the theater… I fly to you,
dearest friends…. Since your last letter the thought has never left me
that we were meant for each other. Do not misjudge my friendship because
it may seem somewhat hasty. Nature waives ceremony in favor of certain
beings. Noble souls are held together by a delicate thread which often
proves lasting….</p>
<p>If you will make allowances for a man who cherishes great ideas and
has performed only small acts; who as yet can only surmise from his
follies that Nature has destined him for something; who demands
unbounded love and yet knows not what he can offer in return; but who
can love something beyond himself, and has no greater torment than the
thought that he is very far from being what he desires to be; if a man
of this stamp may aspire to your friend- ship ours will be eternal, for
I am that man. Perhaps you will love Schiller; even should your esteem
for the poet have declined.</p>
<p>This letter was interrupted, but was resumed on February 22.</p>
<p>I cannot remain any longer in Mannheim…. I must visit Leipzig, and
make your acquaintance. My soul thirsts for new food — for better men —
for friend- ship, affection, and love. I must be near you, and, by your
conversation and company, freshness will be breathed into my wounded
spirit…. You must give me new life, and I shall become more than I ever
was before. I shall be happy — I never yet was happy…. Will you welcome
me ? 82</p>
<p>Korner answered on March 3, “We will welcome you with open arms”; and
he paid G. J. Goschen, a Leipzig publisher, to send Schiller an advance
payment for future essays. 83 When the poet reached Leipzig (March
17,</p>
<ol start="1785" type="1">
<li>Korner was absent in Dresden, but his fiancee, her sister, and Huber
revived Schiller with food and solicitous hospitality. Goschen took to
him at once. “I cannot describe to you,” he wrote, “how grateful and
accommo - dating Schiller is when given critical advice, and how much he
labors at his own moral development.” 84</li>
</ol>
<p>Korner met Schiller for the first time at Leipzig on July 1, and then
re- turned to Dresden. “Heaven brought us together in a wonderful
manner,” Schiller wrote to him, “and our friendship is a miracle.” But
he added that he was again approaching bankruptcy. 85 Korner sent him
money, assurance, and advice:</p>
<p>Should you be in want of more, write to me, and by return post I will
send you any amount… If I were ever so rich, and could… place you above
ever wanting the necessaries of life, still I would not dare do it. I
know that you are capable of earning wherewith to provide for all your
wants as soon</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>as you put your hand to the work. But allow me at least for one year
to place you above the necessity of working. I can spare it without
being worse off myself; and you can repay me, if you like, at your own
convenience. 86</p>
<p>Korner’s generosity was all the more remarkable since he was
preparing for marriage. The wedding took place at Dresden on August 7,
1785. In September Schiller joined them, and he lived with them, or at
their expense, till July 20, 1787. It was about this time — perhaps amid
the happiness of the newlyweds — that he composed his most famous poem,
An die Freude , the Ode to Joy that became the crown of the Ninth
Symphony. Everyone knows Beethoven’s stirring melody, but few of us,
outside of Germany, know Schiller’s words. They began with a call to
universal love, and ended with a summons to revolution:</p>

<p>For two years Korner supported Schiller, hoping that the poet would
beat into presentable shape the drama that was to portray the conflict
between Philip II and his son Carlos. But Schiller dallied so long with
the play that- he lost the mood in which he had begun it; perhaps more
reading of history had altered his view of Philip; in any case, he
changed the plot out of unity and sequence. Meanwhile (February, 1787)
he fell in love with Henrietta von Arnim, and love letters consumed his
ink, while Henrietta shopped for a richer suitor. Korner persuaded
Schiller to isolate himself in a suburb until he had finished his play.
At last it was complete (June, 1787), and the Ham- burg theater offered
to produce it. Schiller’s spirits and pride revived; per - haps now he
might be judged worthy to join the galaxy of literary lights that shone
around Duke Karl August. Korner, relieved, agreed that there was no
future for the poet in Dresden. Besides, Charlotte von Kalb was in
Weimar, husbandless and beckoning. On July 20, after many farewells,
Schiller drove out from Dresden into a new life. On the morrow he was in
Weimar, and the great circle was complete.</p>
