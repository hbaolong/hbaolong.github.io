<h4 id="chapter-xviii-catherine-the-great">CHAPTER XVIII Catherine the
Great</h4>
<p>1762-96</p>
<p>I. THE AUTOCRAT</p>
<p>C ATHERINE was victorious, but exposed to all the hazards of a
chaotic change. To reward the soldiers who had escorted her to power,
she ordered the drinking establishments of the capital to supply them
with beer and vodka free of charge; the result was a general drunkenness
that for a time almost dissolved the military basis of her power. At
midnight of June 29-30 Catherine, who was having her first sleep in
forty-eight hours, was awakened by an officer who tol d her, “Our men
are terribly drunk. A hussar has shouted to them, ’To arms! Thirty
thousand Prussians are coming to take</p>
<p>As news of the coup d’etat spread through Russia it became evident
that</p>
<p>We do not know if the wide sympathy for Peter was a factor in his
death. Broken in spirit, the fallen Czar sent humble petitions to his
wife to “have pity on me, and give me my only consolation”— his mistress
— and to let him return to his relatives in Holstein. Instead of
receiving such comfort he was confined to a single room, and was always
under surveillance. Alexei Orlov, chief of those who guarded him, played
cards with him, and lent him money. 2 On July 6, 1762 (N. S.), Alexei
rode in haste to St. Petersburg and informed</p>
<p>441</p>
<p>44 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Catherine that Peter had quarreled with him and other attendants, and
in the ensuing scuffle had died. As to the mode of his death history has
only rumors, none confirmed: that he was poisoned or strangled , 3 that
he was fatally beaten , 4 that he died of “inflammation of the bowels
and apoplexy”; 5 “the details of the murder,” the latest historian
concludes, “were never fully re - vealed, and the part p layed in it by
Catherine remains uncertain.” 6 It is im - probable that Catherine
ordered the deed , 7 but she punished no one for it, concealed it from
j?he public for a day, went through two days of visible weeping, and
then reconciled herself to the fait accompli. Nearly all Europe held her
guilty of murder, but Frederick the Great, who had so much to lose by
Peter’s dethronement, exonerated her: “The Empress was quite ig - norant
of this crime, and she heard of it with a despair which was not feigned,
for she justly foresaw the judgment that everybody passes upon her
today.” 8 Voltaire agreed with Frederick. Catherine’s son Paul, after
reading the private papers left by his mother at her death, concluded
that Alexei had killed Peter without any order or request from
Catherine. 9</p>
<p>The event created, as well as solved, problems for Catherine: it
inspired a succession of conspiracies to depose her, and left her
harassed and imperiled amid the administrative chaos that surrounded
her. She later wrote of this period: “The Senate remained lethargic and
deaf to the affairs of state. The seats of legislation had reached a
degree of corruption and disintegration that made t hem scarcely
recognizable.” 10 Russia had just emerged from a victorious but costly
war; the treasury owed thirteen million rubles, and was running a
deficit of seven million rubles per year; the condition of the fisc had
been signalized by the refusal of Dutch bankers to lend Russia money.
The pay of the troops was many months in arrears. The army was so dis-
organized that Catherine feared at any moment an invasion of the Ukraine
by the Tatars of South Russia. The court was agitated with plots and
coun- terplots, with dread of losing, or hope of gaining, offices of
profit or power. Shortly after Peter’s fall, the Prussian ambassador
considered it “certain that the reign of the Empress Catherine is not to
be more than a brief episode in the histo ry of the world.” 11 This was
wishful thinking, for Frederick de - plored the death of his worshipful
ally, and Catherine was annulling Peter’s orders to help Frederick.</p>
<p>The Empress sought to quiet ecclesiastical opposition by deferring
the op- eratio n of Peter’s ukases for the secularization of Church
lands. She warmed</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>443</p>
<p>petence, she decided to center all rule in herself, and to face the
absolute monarchs of Europe with a n absolutism that would rival
Frederick’s com - bination of militarism with philosophy. She took no
husband. Since the nobility controlled the Senate, the choice was
between the autocracy of the sovereign and the fragmentary absolutism of
feudal lords — precisely the choice faced by Richelieu in
seventeenth-century France.</p>
<p>Catherine surrounded herself with able men, and won their loyalty,
fre- quently their love. She made them work hard, but she paid them
well, per- haps too well; the splendor and luxury of her court became a
major drain upon the revenues. It was a heterogeneous court, rooted in
barbarism, ve- neered with French culture, and ruled by a German woman
superior to her aides in education and intellect. Her lavish rewards for
exceptional service begot emulation without checking corruption. Many
members of her en- tourage took bribes from foreign governments; some
achieved impartiality by accepting bribes from opposite sides. In 1762
Catherine issued to the na- tion a remarkable confession:</p>
<p>We consider it as our essential and necessary duty to declare to the
people, with true bitterness of heart, that we have for a long time
heard, and now in manifest deeds see, to what degree corruption has
progressed in our Empire, so that there is hardly an office in the
government in which… justice is not attacked by the infection of this
pest. If anyone asks for place, he must pay for it; if a man has to
defend himself against calumny, it is with money; if anyone wishes
falsely to accuse his neighbor, he can by gifts insure the success of
his wicked designs. 12</p>
<p>Of the conspiracies that multiplied around her, some aimed to replace
her with Ivan VI. Deposed by the coup d’etat of December, 1741, he had
now suffered twenty-one years of imprisonment. In September, 1762,
Voltaire voiced apprehension that “Ivan may overthrow our benefactress”;
13 and he wrote, “I am afraid that our dear Empress will be killed.” 14
Catherine visited Ivan, and found him “ a human derelict reduced to
idiocy by long years of incarceration.” 15 She left orders with his
guards that if any attempt, not au - thorized by herself, should be made
to release him, they should put Ivan to death rather than surrender him.
At midnight of July 5-6, 1764, an army officer, Vasili Mirovich,
appeared at the prison with a paper purporting to be an order of the
Senate that Ivan should be turned over to him. Supported by several
soldiers, he knocked at the door of the cell in which two guards slept
with Ivan, and demanded entrance. Refused, he ordered cannon to be
brought up to demolish the door. Hearing this, the guards slew Ivan.
Miro- vich was arrested; a document found on him declared that Catherine
had been deposed, and that Ivan VI was henceforth czar. At his trial he
refused to reveal the names of his accomplices. He was put to death.
Public opinion generally accused Catherine of murdering Ivan. 16</p>
<p>Conspiracies continued. In 1768 an officer named Choglokov, asserting
that he had been commissioned by God to avenge the death of Peter III,
armed himself with a long dagger, found entry to the royal palace, and
hid himself at the turn of a passage where Catherine usually passed.
Grigori</p>
<p>444 RO USSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Orlov heard of the plot, and arrested Choglokov, who proudly
confessed his intent to kill the Empress. He was banished to
Siberia.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE LOVER</li>
</ol>
<p>Surrounded by nobles whom she could not trust, and harassed by
intrigues that disordered administration, Catherine invented a new form
of rule by making her successive lovers the executives of the
government. Each of her lovers was, during his ascendancy, her prime
minister; she added her person to the emoluments of the office, but she
exacted competent service in return. “Of all places in the government,”
wrote Masson (one of Catherine’s many French enemies), “there was not
one of which the duties were so scrupu - lously fulfilled…. Nor,
perhaps, was there any post in which the Empress displayed more choice
and discernment. I believe no instance occurred of its having been
filled by a person incapable of it.” 17 It would be a mistake to think
of Catherine as a debauchee; she observed all the external amenities,
never indulged in risque conversation, never allowed it in her presence.
18 To most of her lovers she gave a faithful — to some a tender —
attachment; her let- ters to Potemkin are almost girlishly devoted, and
the death of Lanskoi afflicted her with a desolating grief.</p>
<p>She approached with both art and science the task of choosing a new
favorite. She watched for men who combined political with physical ca-
pacity; she invited a prospect to dinner, sampled his manners and mind;
if he passed this scrutiny she had him examined by the court physician;
if he sur- vived this test she appointed him her aide-de-camp, gave him
a succulent salary, and admitted him to her bed. Being quite devoid of
religious belief, she allowed no Christian ethic to interfere with her
unique manner of choos- ing ministers. She explained to Nikolai
Saltykov: “I am serving the Empire in educating competent youths.” 19
The treasury paid heavily for these favor - ites — though probably much
less than France paid for the mistresses and con- cubines of Louis XV.
Castera reckoned that the five Orlovs received seven- teen million
rubles, Potemkin fifty million, Lanskoi 7,260,000. Some of this outlay
came back to Russia in effective service; Potemkin, the most pampered of
her lovers, added lucrative territory to the empire.</p>
<p>But why did she change her paramours so often, taking twenty-one in
forty years? Because some failed in one or the other of their double
duties; some died; some proved unfaithful; some were needed in distant
posts. One, Rimsky-Korsakov, she surprised in her own apartments in the
arms of her maid of honor; Catherine merely dismissed him; another,
Mamonov, left her for a younger mate; the Empress resigned him without
revenge. 20 “It is a very remarkable feature in the character of
Catherine,” said Masson, “that none of her favorites incurred her hatred
or her vengeance, though several of them offended her, and their
quitting their office did not depend upon herself. No one [of them] was
ever seen to be punished…. In this respect Catherine appears superior to
all other women.” 21</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>445</p>
<p>After the accession Grigori Orlov retained his ascendancy for ten
years. Catherine amorously extolled him:</p>
<p>Count Grigori has the mind of an eagle. I have never met a man who
has a finer grasp of any matter that he undertakes or even that is
suggested to him…. His honesty is proof against any assault…. It is a
pity that education has had no chance to improve his qualities and
talents, which are indeed supreme, but which his haphazard life has
allowed to lie fallow. 22</p>
<p>“This one,” she wrote elsewhere, “would have remained [her lover and
favorite] forever had he not been the first to tire.” 23 Grigori labored
for the emancipation of the serfs, proposed the liberation of Christians
from the Ottoman yoke, served capably during the wars, offended the
court by pride and insolence, and played truant from Catherine’s arms.
He was banished in 1772 to wealth and comfort on his estates. His
brother Alexei became grand admiral, led the Russian fleet to victory
over the Turks, remained in favor throughout the reign, and lived to
lead his regiments against Napoleon.</p>
<p>Grigori was succeeded as favorite by an obscure Adonis, Alexis
Vassil- chik, whom a court faction foisted upon Catherine to divert her
mind from the banished Orlov, but she found him politically and
otherwise inept and replaced him (1774) with Grigori Alexandrovich
Potemkin. He was an officer in the Horse Guards, whose uniform she had
donned (1762) to lead them against Peter. Noticing that, her sword
lacked the tassel proudly worn by the Guards, Potemkin tore his from the
hilt, rode boldly out of the ranks, and presented the decoration to her;
she accepted it, forgave his audacity, admired his handsome face and
muscular frame. His father, a retired colonel in the lesser nobility,
had destined him for the priesthood; Potemkin received considerable
education in history, classics, and theology, and distinguished himself
at the University of Moscow. But he found army life more suitable than a
seminary to his wild and imaginative temperament. Of course he was
hypnotized by Catherine’s union of beauty and power; “when she enters an
unlit room,” he said, “she lights it up.” 24 In the war of 1768 he led
his cavalry regiment with such reckless courage that Catherine sent him
a personal com- mendation. Back in St. Petersburg, he fretted with
jealousy of the Orlovs and Vassilchik. He quarreled with the Orlovs, and
in a brawl with them he lost an eye. 25 To get the Empress out of his
mind — or to get himself into hers — he left the court, isolated himself
in a suburb, studied theology, let his hair and beard grow, and declared
that he would become a monk. Catherine took pity on him, sent him word
that she had a high regard for him, and invited him to return. He cut
his beard, trimmed his hair, donned his military uni- form, appeared at
court, and thrilled to imperial smiles. When Catherine found Vassilchik
inadequate she opened her arms to Potemkin, then twenty- four, at the
peak of his masculine vigor and dashing charm. Soon she was as
infatuated with him as he with her. She showered favors, rubles, land,
serfs, upon him, and when he was absent she sent him billets-doux quite
innocent of majesty.</p>
<p>How odd it is! Everything I used to laugh at has now happened to me,
for my love for you has made me blind. Sentiments that I thought
idiotic, exag-</p>
<p>446 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>gerated, and scarcely natural I am now experiencing myself. I can’t
keep my silly eyes off you….</p>
<p>We can meet only during the next three days, for then comes the first
week of Lent, which is reserved for prayers and fasting, and… it would
be a great sin to meet. The mere thought of this separation makes me
cry. 26</p>
<p>He proposed marriage to her; some historians believe they were
secretly wed; in several letters she calls him “my beloved husband,” and
speaks of her - self as “your wife” 27 — though we must never conclude
to reality from words. He seems to have tired of her, perhaps because of
her unchecked fondness; the call of adventure proved stronger than the
invitation to assault a citadel already won. His influence over her
remained so great that most of the favor- ites who succeeded him did so
only after his approval had been secured.</p>
<p>It was so with Piotr Zavadovsky, who basked in her boudoir from 1776
to 1777; with Simon Zorich (1777-78), and Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov
(1778-80). Not until she took Alexis Lanskoi (1780) did she have again
an affair of the heart. He was not only handsome and accomplished, he
was a man of poetic sensibility and humane beneficence, an intelligent
friend to letters and arts. “Everybody seemed to share the Sovereign’s
predilection for him.” 28 Sud - denly he was seized with unbearable pain
in the bowels; the court suspected Potemkin of having poisoned him;
despite all medical aid and Catherine’s devoted care, he died, breathing
his last breath in her arms. She passed three days in seclusion and
grief. We hear the woman behind the ruler — the heart behind history —
in her letter of July 2, 1784:</p>
<p>I thought I should die of irreparable loss…. I had hoped that he
would be the support of my old age. He was attentive, he learned much,
he had ac- quired all my tastes. He was a young man whom I was bringing
up, and who was grateful, kind, and good…. Lanskoi is no more,… and my
room, so pleasant before, has become an empty den, in which I can just
drag myself about like a shadow…. I cannot look upon a human face
without my voice choking…. I cannot sleep or eat…. I know not what will
become of me. 2 ®</p>
<p>For a year she denied herself a lover; then she yielded to Alexis
Ermolov ( 1785 — 86), who so displeased Potemkin that he was quickly
replaced by Alexis Mamonov. Alexis soon tired of his
fifty-seven-year-old mistress; he asked permission to marry Princess
Sherbatov; Catherine gave the couple a court marriage, and sent them off
loaded with presents (1789). 30 The last on the list was Platon Zubov
(1789-96), a lieutenant in the Horse Guards, muscular and mannerly.
Catherine was grateful for his services; she took upon herself the care
of his education, and ended by treating him as a son. He stayed with her
till her death.</p>

<li>THE PHILOSOPHER</li>

<p>Between love and war, statesmanship and diplomacy, this astonishing
woman found time for philosophy. We get a measure of the high repute won

<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>447</p>
<p>eenth century proud to correspond with them, and competing for their
praise.</p>
<p>Long before her accession Catherine had relished the style, wit, and
irrev- erencies of Voltaire, and had dreamed of becoming the
“enlightened des - pot” of his dreams. She mu st have liked Diderot too,
for in September, 1762, she offered to print the E?icyclopedie in
St. Petersburg if the French govern- ment continued to outlaw it. Only
one letter survives of those that she wrote to Voltaire before 1765; it
replied to some lines that he had sent her in Octo- ber, 1763:</p>
<p>For the first time 1 regret that I am not a poet, and that 1 must
answer your verses in prose. But I may tell you that since 1746 I have
been under the greatest obligations to you. Before that period I read
nothing but romances, but by chance your works fell into my hands, and
ever since then I have never ceased to read them, and have had no desire
for books less well written than yours, or less instructive…. So I
return continually to the creator of my taste as to my deepest
amusement. Assuredly, monsieur, if I have any knowl- edge I owe it to
you. I am now reading the Essai sur Vhistoire generate, and 1 should
like to learn every page of it by heart. 31</p>
<p>Throughout her life, or till their deaths, Catherine corresponded
with Voltaire, Diderot, d’Alembert, Mme. Geoff rin, Grimm, and many more
French notables. She contributed to the funds Voltaire raised for the
Calas and the Sirvens. We have seen how she ordered large shipments of
watches from Ferney, and of stockings knitted by Voltaire’s workers,
sometimes (if we may believe the old fox) by Voltaire himself. It was a
feather in his skull- cap that crowned heads should so honor him, and he
repaid Catherine by becoming her press agent in France. He exonerated
her from complicity in the death of Peter III; “I know,” he wrote, “that
Catherine is reproached with some bagatelle about her husband; but these
are family matters in which I do not mix.” 32 He pleaded with his
friends to support him in supporting Catherine; so to d’Argental:</p>
<p>I have another favor to ask of you; it is for my Catherine. We must
establish her reputation in Paris among worthy people. I have strong
reasons for be- lieving that MM. the Dukes of Praslin and Choiseul do
not regard her as the most scrupulous woman in the world. Nevertheless I
know… that she had no part in the death of that drunkard of hers….
Besides, he was the greatest fool that ever occupied a throne…. We are
under obligations to Catherine for having had the courage to dethrone
her husband, for she reigns with wis- dom and with glory, and we ought
to bless a crowned head who makes re- ligious toleration universal
through 135 degrees of longitude…. Say, then, much good for Catherine, I
pray you. 33</p>
<p>Mme. du Deffand thought this exculpation of the Empress quite
shameful; Mme. de Choiseul and Horace Walpole denounced it. 34 Praslin
and Choiseul, who were directing the foreign relations of France, could
not be expected to admire an Empress who was opposing French influence
in Poland and defy- ing it in Turkey. Voltaire himself had occasional
doubts; when he learned that Ivan VI had been slain, he admitted sadly
that “we must moderate a little our enthusiasm” for Catherine. 35 But
soon he was praising her legislative</p>
<p>448</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>program, her patronage of the arts, her campaign for religious
liberty in Poland; now (May 18, 1767) he gave her the title of
“Semiramis of the North.” When she went to war with Turkey he
interrupted his attack upon I’infdme (the Catholic Church) to applaud
her crusade to save Christians from Mohammedans.</p>
<p>Diderot was equally fascinated by beauty on the throne, and with sub-
stantial reasons. When Catherine heard that he was planning to sell his
library in order to raise a dowry for his daughter, she instructed her
Paris agent to buy it at whatever price Diderot should ask; he asked and
received sixteen thousand livres. Then she requested Diderot to keep the
books till his death, and to be their custodian for her at a salary of a
thousand livres per year; moreover, she paid his salary twenty-five
years in advance. Diderot overnight became a rich man and a defender of
Catherine. When she invited him to visit her he could hardly refuse.
“Once in a lifetime,” he said, “one must see such a woman.” 36</p>
<p>Having arranged the finances of his wife and daughter, he set out,
aged sixty (June 3, 1773), on the long, rough journey to St. Petersburg.
He dallied two months in Tbe Hague, sipping fame; proceeded via Dresden
and Leip- zig; carefully avoiding Berlin and Frederick, about whom he
had made some barbed remarks. Twice on the trip he fell violently sick
of colic. He reached St. Petersburg on October 9, and was received by
the Czarina on the tenth. “Nobody knows better than she,” he reported,
“the art of putting everyone</p>
<p>For a while he tried, like Voltaire with Frederick, to play the
diplomat, and turn Russia from alliance with Austria and Prussia to
alliance with France; 39 she soon diverted him to topics nearer to his
trade. He told her in some detail how Russia could be transformed into
Utopia; she listened gaily, but remained skeptical. Later she recalled
these conversations in a letter to Comte Louis-Philippe de Segur:</p>
<p>I talked much and frequently with him, but with more curiosity than
profit. If I had believed him everything would have been turned upside
down in my kingdom; legislation, administration, finance — all would
have been turned topsy- turvy to make room for impractical theories….
Then, speaking openly to him, I said: “Monsieur Diderot, I have listened
with the greatest pleasure to all that your brilliant intellect has
inspired. With all your high principles one would make fine books, but
very bad business…. You work only upon paper, which endures all things;…
but I, poor Empress as I am, work on the human skin, which is irritable
and ticklish to a different degree.”… There - after he talked only about
literature. 40</p>
<p>When she came upon some notes that he had made “On the Instructions
of her Imperial Majesty… for the Drawing up of Laws,” she described</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>hem (after his death) as “veritable babble, in which one could find
neither knowledge of realities nor prudence, nor insight.” 41
Nevertheless she enjoyed</p>
<p>After five months of ecstasy in her friendship, and discomfort at her
court, Diderot turned homeward. Catherine ordered a special carriage
built for him, in which he could recline at ease. She asked him what
gifts she should send him; he answered, None, but he reminded her that
she had not yet kept her promise to reimburse him for the expenses of
his trip; he calculated these at fifteen hundred rubles, she gave him
three thousand and a costly ring, and assigned an officer to accompany
him to The Hague. On his return to Paris he eulogized her
gratefully.</p>
<p>Catherine made no approaches to Rousseau, who was painfully antipodal
to her in temper and ideas. But she cultivated Melchior Grimm, for she
knew that his Correspondance litteraire reached influential Europeans.
He took the first step by offering (1764) to send her his periodical
letters; she agreed, and paid him fifteen hundred rubles per year. He
first saw her when he went to St. Petersburg (1773) in the retinue of
the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt to attend the marriage of the Prince’s
sister to Grand Duke Paul. Catherine found him much more realistic than
Diderot, and very usefully informed on all aspects of that Parisian
world which fascinated her with its literature, philosophy, art, women,
and salons. She invited him to chat with her almost every day during the
winter of 1773-74. About these meetings she wrote to Voltaire: “M.
Grimm’s conversation is a delight to me; but we have so many things to
say to each other that thus far our interviews have been marked by more
eagerness than order or se quence.” In the ardor of these conversa -
tions she had repeatedly to remind herself that (as she put it) she must
return to her gagne-pain — earn her bread by attending to the business
of govern- ment. 43 Grimm came back to Paris dripping with enthusiasm
for Catherine as “the nourishment of my soul, the consolation of my
heart, the pride of my mind, the joy of Russia, and the hope of Europe.”
44 He visited St. Petersburg</p>
<p>What were the results of this flirtation between autocracy and
philosophy? Insofar as she cultivated the philo sophes as her press
agents in France, the political effect was nil; French policy, and
consequently French historians, remained bitterly hostile to a Russia
that was balking French aims in Eastern Europe. But her admiration for
the heroes of the French Enlightenment was sincere, having begun long
before her accession to power; if it had been an</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>affectation it would not have borne such long confrontations with
Diderot and Grimm. Her liaison with French thought helped to Europeanize
literate Russia, and to modify the Western view of Russia as a colossal
brute. Many Russians followed Catherine’s lead, corresponded with French
writers, and</p>
<p>felt the influence of French culture, manners, and art. A growing
number of Russians visited Paris, and though many spent their time in
sexual adventures, many frequented the salons, the museums, and the
court, read French liter- ature and philosophy, and brought back with
them ideas that shared in pre- paring the outburst of Russian literature
in the nineteenth century.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE STATESMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>We can hardly doubt the good intentions of Catherine in the early
years of her reign.</p>
<p>In her copy of Fenelon’s Telemaque were found these resolutions:</p>
<p>Study mankind, learn to use men without surrendering to them
unreservedly. Search for true merit, be it at the other end of the
world, for usually it is modest and retiring.</p>
<p>Do not allow yourself to become the prey of flatterers; make them
under- stand that you care neither for praise nor for obsequiousness.
Have confidence in those who have the courage to contradict you,… and
who place more value on your reputation than on your favor.</p>
<p>Be polite, humane, accessible, compassionate, and liberal-minded. Do
not let your grandeur prevent you from condescending with kindness
toward the small, and putting yourself in their place. See that this
kindness, however, does not weaken your authority nor diminish their
respect…. Reject all artificiality. Do not allow the world to
contaminate you to the point of making you lose the ancient principles
of honor and virtue….</p>
<p>I swear by Providence to stamp these words into my heart. 46</p>
<p>She informed herself assiduously on every relevant subject, and wrote
de- tailed instructions on a thousand topics from army training and
industrial operations to the toilette of her court and the production of
operas and plays. Said one of her earliest and least friendly
biographers:</p>
<p>Ambition extinguished not in C atherine’s soul an ardent relish for
pleasure. But she knew how to renounce pleasure, and to make the
transition to employ- ments the most serious, and application the most
indefatigable to the affairs of government. She assisted at all the
deliberations of the Council, read the dis- patches of her ambassadors,
and dictated, or indicated… the answers to be returned. She entrusted
her ministers with only the details of business, and still kept her eye
on the execution. 47</p>
<p>The task of governing her vast area was made almost impossible by the
number (ten thousand), diversity, contradictions, and chaos of existing
laws. Hoping to play Justinian to Russia, and to consolidate her power,
Catherine, on December 14, 1766, summoned to Moscow administrative
agents and legal experts from every part of the empire, to undertake a
thorough revision and codification of Russian law. In preparation for
their coming she per- sonally prepared a Nakaz , or lnstructto?is ,
describing the principles upon</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) CATHERINE THE GREAT 45 1</p>
<p>which the new code should be formed. These reflected her reading of
Mon- tesquieu, Beccaria, Blackstone, and Voltaire. She began by
declaring that Russia must be thought of as a European state, and should
have a constitution based upon “European principles.” This did not, in
her understanding, mean a “constitutional government” subordinating the
sovereign to a legislature chosen by the people; the educational level
of Russia would not permit even so limited an electoral franchise as
existed in Britain. It meant a government in which the ruler, though
ultimately the sole source of law, ruled in obedi- ence to law.
Catherine upheld the feudal system — i.e., the system of mutual loyalty
and services between peasant and vassal, vassal and liege lord, lord and
sovereign — as indispensable to economic, political, and military order
in the Russia of 1766 (a land of communities almost isolated from one
another, and from the center of government, by difficulties of
communication and transport); but she urged that the rights of masters
over their serfs should be defined and limited by law, that serfs should
be allowed to own property, and that the trial and punishment of serfs
should be transferred from the feudal lord to a public magistrate
responsible to a provincial court respon- sible to the sovereign. 48 All
trial should be open, torture should not be used, capital punishment
should be abolished in law as well as in fact. Religious worship should
be free; “amo ngst so many different creeds the most injurious error
would be intolerance.” 49 The Nakaz, before being printed, was sub -
mitted by her to her advisers; they warned her that any sudden change
from existing custom would plunge Russia into disorder; and she allowed
them to modify her proposals, especially those for the gradual
emancipation of the serfs. 50</p>
<p>Even as so bowdlerized the Instructions, published in Holland in
1767, stirred the European intelligentsia to enthusiastic praise. The
Empress sent a copy direct to Voltaire, who made his usual obeisance.
“Madame, last night I received one of the guarantees of your immortality
— your code in a German translation. Today I have begun to translate it
into French. It will appear in Chinese, in every tongue; it will be a
gospel for all mankind.” 51 And he added in later letters: “Legislators
have the first place in the temple of glory; conquerors come behind
them…. I regard the Instructions as the finest monument of the century.”
52 The French government forbade the sale of the Instructions in
France.</p>
<p>The modified Nakaz was presented to the “Committee for Drafting a New
Code,” which met on August 10, 1767. It was compos ed of 564 mem- bers
elected by various groups: 161 from the nobility, 208 from the towns, 79
from the free peasantry, 54 from the Cossacks, 34 from non-Russian
tribes (Christian or not), and 28 from the government. The clergy was
not represented as a class, and the serfs were not represented at all.
In some ways the Committee corresponded to the States-General that was
to meet in Paris in 1789; and, as in that more famous assembly, the
delegates brought to the government lists of grievances and proposals
for reform from their constitu- ents. These documents were transmitted
to the Empress, and they offered her and her aides a valuable survey of
the condition of the realm.</p>
<p>45 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>The Committee was empowered not to pass laws, but to advise the
sover- eign on the state and needs of each class or district, and to
offer suggestions for legislation. The delegates were guaranteed freedom
of speech and in- violability of person. Some of them proposed the
emancipation of all serfs, some asked that the right to own serfs be
more widely extended. In Decem- ber, 1767, the Committee recessed; in
February, 1768, it moved to St. Peters- burg; altogether it held 203
sessions; on December 18, 1768, it was adjourned sine die because the
outbreak of war with Turkey called many delegates to the front. The task
of drafting proposed legislation was deputed to subcom- mittees, some of
which continued to meet till 1775; but no code of laws was formulated.
Catherine was not altogether displeased with this inconclusive result.
“The Committee,” she said, “… has given me light and knowledge for all
the Empire. I know now what is necessary, and with what I should occupy
myself. It has elaborated all parts of the law, and has distributed the
affairs under heads. I should have done more had it not been for the war
with Turkey, but a unity hitherto unknown in the principles and methods
of discussion has been introduced.” 53 Meanwhile she had show n the
nobles on how broad a base her power rested. The Committee, before
adjourning, pro- posed to confer upon her the appellation “Great”; she
refused, but consented to be called “Mother of the Country.”</p>
<p>Two of Catherine’s recommendations became law: the abolition of
torture and the establishment of religious toleration. This was widely
extended: it allowed the Roman Catholic Church to compete with the Greek
Orthodox; it protected the Jesuits even after the dissolution of their
order by Pope Clement XIV (1773); it permitted the Volga Tatars to
rebuild their mosques. Catherine admitted the Jews into Russia, but she
subjected them to special taxes, and (possibly for their safety)
confined them to specific areas. She left the Raskolniki — religious
dissenters — free to practice their rites unhindered; “we have indeed,”
she wrote to Voltaire, “fanatics who, as they are no longer persecuted
by others, burn themselves; but if those of other countries did the
same, no great harm would result.” 54</p>
<p>The philosophes were especially pleased by Catherine’s subordination
of the Russian Church to the state. Some of them complained that she
still at- tended religious services (so did Voltaire); the older of them
recognized that her attendance was indispensable to retaining the
allegiance of the people. By a decree of February 26, 1764, she turned
into state property all the lands of the Church. The salaries of the
Orthodox clergy were henceforth paid by the state — so ensuring their
support of the government. Many monasteries and nunneries were closed;
those that remained were forbidden to accept more than a prescribed
number of novices, and the legal age for taking vows was raised. The
surplus revenues from ecclesiastical institutions were applied to the
foundation of schools, asylums, and hospitals. 55</p>
<p>Both the clergy and the nobility opposed the extension of popular
educa- tion, fearing that the spread of knov/ledge among the masses
would lead to heresy, unbelief, and factionalism, and would imperil
social order. Here, as elsewhere, Catherine began with liberal
aspirations. She appealed to Grimm:</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>Listen a moment, my philosophical friends: you would be charming,
ador- able, if you would have the charity to map out a plan for young
people, from ABC to university…. I, who have not studied and lived in
Paris, have neither knowledge nor insight in the matter…. 1 am very much
concerned about an idea for a university and its management, a gymnasium
[secondary school] and an elementary school…. Until you accede to my
request I shall hunt through the Ency elope die. Oh, I shall be certain
to draw out what I want! 56</p>
<p>Meanwhile she was moved by the pedagogical enthusiasm of Ivan Betsky,
who had traveled in Sweden, Germany, Holland, Italy, and France, had
frequented the salon of Mme. Geoff rin, had studied the Encyclopedic ,
and had met Rousseau. In 1763 she organized at Moscow a school for
foundlings, which by 1796 had graduated forty thousand students; in 1764
a school for boys was opened in St. Petersburg, and in 1765 a school for
girls; in 1764 the Smolny Monastery was transformed into the Smolny
Institute for girls of the nobility — an echo of Mme. de Mai ntenon’s
St. -Cyr; Catherine was the first Russian ruler to do anything for the
education of women. Baffled by the dearth of qualified teachers, she
sent Russian students to study pedagogy in England, Germany, Austria,
and Italy. A teachers’ college was founded in 1786.</p>
<p>She admired Joseph II’s reforms of education in Austria, and asked
him to lend her someone familiar with his procedure. He sent her Theodor
Yanko- vich, who drew up for her a plan which she promulgated as a
“Statute of Popular Schools” (August 5, 1786). An elementary school was
established in the chief town of each county, and a high school in each
of the principal cities of twenty-six provinces. These schools were open
to all children of any class; corporal punishment was not allowed in
them; teachers and textbooks were provided by the state. The project was
largely frustrated by the reluc- tance of the parents to send their
children to school rather than use them for labor at home. In the ten
years between their foundation and Catherine’s death the “popular
schools” grew slowly from forty to 3 16; the teachers from 136 to 744;
the pupils from 4,398 to 17,341. In 1796 Russia was still far be- hind
the West in public instruction.</p>
<p>Higher education was scantily provided by the University of Moscow,
and by special academies. A School of Commerce was founded in 1772, an
Academy of Mines in 1773. The old Academy of Sciences was enlarged and
was provided with ample funds. In 1783, on urging by Princess Dashkova,
and under her presidency, a Russian Academy was organized for the im-
provement of the language, the encouragement of literature, and the
study of history; it issued translations, published periodicals, and
compiled a dic- tionary which appeared in six installments between 1789
and 1799.</p>
<p>Appalled by the high death rate in Russia, and the primitive
character of public sanitation and personal hygiene, Catherine brought
in foreign physi- cians, established a College of Pharmacy at Moscow,
and provided funds for the production of surgical instruments. She
opened in Moscow three new hospitals, a foundling asylum, and an insane
asylum, and in St. Petersburg three new hospitals, including a “Secret
Hospital” for venereal diseases. 57 In</p>
<p>454</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>1768 she introduced into Russia inoculation for smallpox, and quieted
public fears by serving, aged forty, as the second Russian subject of
the treatment; soon Catherine reported to Voltaire that “more people had
been inoculated here in one month than in Vienna in a year.” 58 (In 1772
Naples had its first inoculation, and in 1774 Louis XV, zminoculated,
died of smallpox.)</p>
<p>V. THE ECONOMIST</p>
<p>One of Ca therine’s basic measures (1765) provided for a survey of
all Russian land. The operation met with much resistance from landlords;
by the end of the reign it had covered twenty out of fifty provinces,
but it was not completed till the middle of the nineteenth century. As
it proceeded the Empress realized with discouraging clarity how the
economy of Russia rested upon the organization of agriculture by a
feudal system of lords and serfs. In 1766 she offered a prize of a
thousand ducats for the best essay on the emancipation of the serfs. The
winner was Bearde de l’Abbaye of Aix -la- Chapelle, who argued that “the
whole universe demands of sovereigns that they should emancipate the
peasants,” and predicted that agri cultural pro- duction would be
immensely increased by “making the farmers the owners of the land they
cultivate.” 59 The noble landowners, however, warned Catherine that
unless the peasant was bound to the land and his landlord he would
migrate to the towns or, more irresponsibly, from village to village,
creating chaos, disrupting production, and interfering with the
conscription of sturdy peasant sons for the army or the fleet.</p>
<p>The puzzled Czarina proceeded cautiously, for the nobles had the
money and the arms to overthrow her, and in such an attempt they could
rely upon the support of a clergy resenting the loss of their lands and
their serfs. She feared the disorder that might come from a wholesale
movement of liberated peasants to towns unprepared to house or feed or
employ them. She made moves toward emancipation. She renewed the edict
of Peter III forbidding the purchase of serfs for factory labor, and she
required employers to pay their workers in cash and to maintain
conditions of work as determined by the officials of the town or the
mir; 6# even so, the status of industrial serfs remained one of
heartless and stupefying slavery. Catherine forbade serfdom in the towns
that she founded, 61 and, on their payment of a small fee, she freed the
serfs on lands taken over from the Church. 62 These improvements,
however, were outweighed by her repeated grants of state lands to men
who had served her well as generals, statesmen, or lovers; in this way
over 800,000 free peasants became serfs. The proportion of serfs in the
rural population rose from 52.4 per cent at the outset of the reign to
55.5 per cent at its close, and the number of serfs rose from 7,600,000
to 2o,ooo,ooo. 63 By her “Let - ters of Grace to the Nobility” (1785)
Catherine completed her surrender to the nobles: she reaffirmed their
exemption from the poll tax, corporal punishment, and military service,
and their right to be tried only by their peers, to mine their lands, to
own industrial enterprises, and to travel abroad</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>455</p>
<p>at will. She forbade the landlords to be tyrannical or cruel, but she
nullified this prohibition by forbidding the serfs to send her their
complaints.</p>
<p>The peasants, so silenced, resorted to flight, rebellion, or
assassination. Be- tween 1760 and 1769 thirty landlords were killed by
their peasants; between 1762 and 1773 there were forty peasant revolts.
64 These were quickly sup- pressed until a rebel leader arose who knew
how to turn resentment into organization, and peasant arms into
victories. Emelyan Pugachev was a Don Cossack who had fought in Russian
ranks against the Prussians and the Turks. He asked for discharge, was
refused, deserted, was captured, de- serted again, and accepted the life
of an outlaw. In November, 1772, en- couraged by discontented monks, he
proclaimed that he was Peter III, who had miraculously survived all
attempts to kill him. He attracted peasants and brigands to his
standard, until he felt strong enough to declare open rebel- lion
against the usurper Catherine (September, 1773). Cossacks of the Urals,
the Volga, and the Don; thousands of men who had been condemned to
force-labor in the mines and smelters of the Urals; hundreds of Old Be-
lievers eager to overthrow the Orthodox Church; local Tatar, Kirghiz,
and Bashkir tribes who had not forgiven Elizabeth’s dragooning of them
into Christianity; serfs who had fled from their masters, and prisoners
who had escaped from jail: t hese flocked to Pugachev’s standard, until
he had twenty</p>
<p>Catherine at first made fun of “ le marquis Pugachev,” but when she
learned that the rebels had taken Kazan, she sent a substantial force
under General Piotr Ivanovich Panin to suppress the rebellion. The
nobles, seeing the whole feudal structure endangered, came to her aid;
soon General Alex- ander Vasilievich Suvorov joined Panin with cavalry
freed by peace with the Turks; the insurgents were thrown into disorder
by their encounter with disciplined troops under imperial officers; they
retreated from one position to another, exhausted their provisions, and
began to starve. Some of their leaders, hoping to earn bread and pardon,
made Pugachev their prisoner and delivered him to the victors. He was
brought to Moscow in an iron cage, was tried in the Kremlin, was
beheaded and then quartered, and his head was exhibited on a pole in
four sections of the city, pour decourager les autres. Five of his
captains were executed, others were knouted this side of death, and were
sent to Siberia. One result of the revolt was to strengthen the alliance
of the Empress with the nobility.</p>
<p>In some measure she challenged the nobility by favoring the growth of
a business class. Convinced by the arguments of the physiocrats, she
established free trade in agricultural products (1762), later in
everything; she put an end</p>
<p>456</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>( 1 775 ) t0 government-sanctioned monopolies by ruling that any man
should be free to undertake and operate an industrial enterprise. The
growth of a middle class was retarded by the predominance of cottage and
manorial industry, and the participation of nobles in industrial and
commercial ven- tures. Factories multiplied from 984 to 3,161 during
Catherine’s reign, but these were mostly small shops employing only a
few workers. Urban popu- lation increased from 328,000 in 1724 to
1,300,000 in 1796 — still less than four per cent of the population.
65</p>
<p>The busy Empress, with only grudging support from her noble
entourage, did what she could to promote commerce. Roads were terrible,
but rivers were many, and canals bound them into a beneficent web. Under
Catherine a canal was begun between the Volga and the Neva to join the
Baltic with the Caspian Sea, and she planned another to join the Caspian
and Black Seas. 66 By negotiation or by war she secured the unhindered
passage of Rus- sian commerce into the Black Sea and thence into the
Mediterranean. She prodded her diplomats to arrange trade treaties with
England (1766), Poland (1775), Denmark (1782), Turkey (1783), Austria
(1785), and France</p>
<p>(1787). Foreign commerce grew from 21,000,000 rubles in 1762 to
96,000,- 000 in 1 7 96. 67</p>
<p>In such figures we must allow for the currency inflation with which
gov- ernments pay for their wars. To finance her campaigns against
Turkey Catherine borrowed, at home and abroad, 130,000,000 rubles; she
issued paper money far beyond any gold collateral; during her reign the
ruble lost thirty-two per cent of its value. In the same period, despite
a rise of revenues from 17,000,000 to 78,000,000 rubles, the national
debt rose to 215,000,- ooo. 68 Most of this was due to the wars that
broke the power of Turkey, and carried the borders of Russia to the
Black Sea.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE WARRIOR</li>
</ol>
<p>Like any philosopher, Catherine had begun with pacific aims. She an-
nounced that the internal problems of the empire would absorb her
attention, and that she would, if unmolested, avoid all conflict with
foreign powers. She confirmed Peter Ill’s peace with Prussia, and ended
his war with Den - mark. She rejected in 1762 the temptation to conquer
Kurland or to interfere in Poland; “I have people enough to make happy,”
she said, “and that little corner of the earth will add nothing to my
comfort.” 69 She reduced the army, neglected the arsenals, and sought to
negotiate with Turkey a treaty of perpetual peace.</p>
<p>But the more she studied the map, the more fault she found with the
boundaries of Russia. On the east the empire was well protected by the
Urals, the Caspian Sea, and the weakness of China. On the north it was
protected by ice. But on the west Sweden held part of Finland, from
which at any mo- ment an attack might be expected from a nation still
resenting its losses to Peter the Great; and Poland and Prussia barred
the way into “Europe” and Europeanization. On the south the Tatars,
under a Moslem and Turkish-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>457</p>
<p>controlled khan, barred the way to the Black Sea. What abortions of
history had given Russia such geography, such anomalous boundaries? Old
General Miinnich, new general Grigori Orlov, whispered to her how much
more rational it would be if the Black Sea were the southern boundary,
and how sweet it would be if Russia could take Constantinople and
control the Bos- porus. Nikita Panin, her foreign minister from 1763 to
1780, pondered ways of promoting Russia’s influence in Poland and
preventing that defenseless land from falling under Prussian
domination.</p>
<p>Catherine was moved by their arguments. And she itched to give her
adopted country a place in politics commensurate with its place on the
map. Within a year of her accession she sallied forth upon a foreign
policy that aimed at nothing less than to make Russia the pivotal power
on the Con- tinent. “I tell you,” she wrote to Count Keyserling, he r
ambassador at War- saw, “that my aim is to be joined in bonds of
friendship with all the powers, in armed alliance, so that I may always
be able to range myself on the side of the oppressed, and so become the
arbiter of Europe.” 70</p>
<p>At times she came close to her goal. By taking Russia out of the
Seven Years’ War she in effect decided that Continent -wide conflict in
favor of Frederick. In 1764 she signed with Frederick a treaty that
presaged the dis- memberment of Poland. She took advantage of Denm ark’s
need of Russian support against Sweden to dominate the foreign policy of
the Danes. In</p>
<p>1779 she served as arbiter between Frederick and Joseph at the Peace
of Teschen, and became protectress of the German Imperial Constitution.
In</p>
<p>1 780 she bound Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, Austria, and Portugal with
Russia in a “League of Armed Neutrality” to protect neutral shipping in
the war of England with the American colonies: neutral ships were to be
free from attack by either combatant unless they carried munitions of
war; and a blockade, to be legal and respected, must be real, and no
mere paper declara- tion.</p>
<p>Long before that second reversal of alliances the irrepressible
conflict had begun for control of the Black Sea. Catherine’s f irst
Turkish war origi- nated as a strange by-product of her invasion of
Poland. She had sent troops there to help the non-Catholics in their
struggle for equal rights with the Catholic majority; the Catholics
moved a papal nuncio to explain to Turkey that now was an opportune time
for Turkey to attack Russia; France sec- onded the suggestion, and urged
Sweden and the Khan of the Crimea to join in the attack. 71 Voltaire
mourned for his endangered Empress. “That a nun - cio enlists the Turks
in his cr usade against you,” he wrote to her, “is worthy of an Italian
farce: Mustafa the worthy ally of the Pope!”— the situation almost
persuaded him to be a Christian. Indeed, in a letter of November, 1768,
he proposed to Catherine a holy war against the infidels:</p>
<p>You force the Poles to be tolerant and happy despite the nuncio, and
you seem to be having trouble with the Mussulmen. If they wage war on
you, per- haps Peter the Great’s idea of making Constantinople the
capital of the Rus - sian Empire may take shape…. I think that if ever
the Turks are expelled from Europe it will be by the Russians…. It is
not enough to humiliate them; they must be sent back forever. 72</p>
<p>458 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Sweden refused to share in the assault upon Russia, but the Crimean
Tatars ravaged the newly settled Russian colony of Novaya Serbia
(January, 1769). A Turkish army of 100,000 men advanced toward Podolia
to join the army of the Polish Confederation. Catherine refused to
withdraw her forces from Poland. She sent thirty thousand men under
Alexander Golitsyn and Piotr Rumiantsev to repulse the Tatars and check
the Turks; told that these were too numerous, she replied, “The Romans
did not concern themselv es with the number of their enemies; they only
asked, ‘Where are they?’” 73 The Tatars were driven back; Azov and
Taganrog, at the mouth of the Don, were taken; seventeen thousand
Russians defeated 150,000 Turks at Kagul (1770); Ru- miantsev advanced
as far as Bucharest, where he was received with joy by the Orthodox
population. In 1771 Vasili Mikhailovich Dolgoruki overran the Crimea and
put an end to Turkish rule there. Even more spectacular was the exploit
of Alexei Orlov, who led a Russian fleet through the English Channel,
the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean, defeated the Turkish navy off
Chios, and annihilated it at Chesme (July, 1770); but the damage to his
own ships was too severe to let him follow up his victories.</p>
<p>Some other events were less comforting to Catherine. A plague broke
out in the Russian army along the Danube and spread back to Moscow,
where, in the summer of 1770, it took a thousand lives a day. She knew
that Frederick looked askance at the extension of her realm and power;
that Joseph II was disturbed by the advance of Russia to the Austrian
frontier in the Balkans; that France was leaving no stone unturned to
strengthen her Turkish ally; that England would vigorously oppose
Russian control of the Bosporus; and that Sweden was merely awaiting her
opportunity. Catherine invited the Turks to a conference; they came, but
balked at her insistence on the inde- pendence of the Crimea; and in
1773 the war was resumed.</p>
<p>In January, 1774, Mustafa III died; his successor decided that Turkey
had reached a condition of chaos and exhaustion that threatened her
existence as a European state. By the Peace of Kuchuk Kainarji (in
Romania), July 21, 1774, Turkey recognized the independence of the
Crimea (which remained under Tatar rule), ceded Azov, Kerch, Yenikale,
and Kilburun (at the</p>
<p>mouth of the Dnieper) to Russia, opened the Black Sea, the Bosporus,
and the Dardanelles to Russian shipping, paid Russia a war indemnity of
4,500,- 000 rubles, granted amnesty to Christians involved in
insurrections against their Turkish governors, and acknowledged the
right of Russia to protect Christians in Turkey. Altogether, this was
one of the most advantageous treaties ever made by Russia. 74 Russia was
now a Black Sea power; the Crimea and the other Tatar regions in South
Russia were left open to early Russian conquest, and the skeptical
Empress could pose as the defender of the faith. Drunk with success,
Catherine dreamed of liberating — i.e., conquering — Greece, and
crowning her grandson Constantine at Constantinople as head of a new
empire. She gladdened Voltaire’s aging heart with visions of Olympic
Games restored; “we will have the ancient Greek tragedies enacted by Gre
- cian players in the theater of [Dionysius at] Athen s.” Then, mindful
of armies and treasury exhausted, she added: “I must practice
moderation, and say that peace is better than the finest war in the
world.” 75</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>She was now replacing Frederick as the most famous sovereign in
Europe; everyone marveled at her resolute pursuit of her aims, and the
awesome ex- tension of her power. Joseph II of Austria, who had so long
bowed to the genius of Frederick, traveled to Mogilev, and thence all
the way to St. Pe- tersburg, to meet the Czarina and solicit her
alliance. In May, 1781, she signed with Joseph a pact for united action
in Poland and against Turkey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Potemkin was making a name for himself in the south. He or-
ganized, equipped, and fed a new army of 300,000 men, built a Black Sea
fleet, with harbors at Sevastopol and Odessa and an arsenal at Kherson,
colon- ized the sparsely settled regions of South Russia, founded towns
and villages, established manufactures, and supplied the colonists with
cattle, tools, and seed — all with a view to having bases of supplies in
a campaign to add the Cri- mea to Catherine’s crown, and perhaps win a
crown for himself. The Tatars of the Crimea quarreled and divided;
Potemkin softened their leaders with bribes; when, at last, he invaded
the peninsula (December, 1782), he found only negligible resistance, and
on April 8, 1783, over Turkey’s futile protests, the Crimea was absorbed
into the Russian realm. Potemkin was made field marshal, president of
the College of War, Prince of Tauris, and governor general of the
Crimea. The Empress added a pourboire of 100,000 rubles; Potemkin used
them on mistresses, liquor, and food.</p>
<p>Catherine too thought it time for relaxation. She combined pleasure
with business by arranging a stately “progress” over land and water to
inspect her conquests and impress their people — and all Europe — with
the wealth and splendor of her court. On January 2, 1787, muffled in
furs, she left the Win- ter Palace and began the long journey in a
berime , or coach, large enough to contain — besides her now spacious
self — her current favorite Mamonov, her chief lady in waiting, a
lapdog, and a small library. She was followed by fourteen carriages and
170 sleighs, bearing the ambassadors of Austria, Brit- ain, and France —
Cobenzl, Fitzherbert, and the Comte de Segur — plus the Prince de Ligne
and an army of officials, courtiers, musicians, and servants. Potemkin
had gone some days in advance to prepare the route, to light it by
hundreds of torches, and to arrange for each evening’s meals and
sleeping quarters for all. At major towns the cortege rested for one or
two days while the Czarina met the local dignitaries, surveyed
conditions, asked questions, distributed censure or reward. Every town
on the route, warned and in- structed by Potemkin, was on its best
behavior, washed and dressed as never before, happy for a day.</p>
<p>At Kiev Potemkin superintended the transfer of the mobile court
to</p>
<p>eighty-seven vessels which he had equipped and adorned. On these the
im- perial horde moved down the Dnieper. Along the river Catherine saw
the “Potemkin villages” which the clever Prince of Tauris had primed and
pol - ished for her pleasure, and perhaps to impress the diplomats with
the prosper- ity of Russia. Some of the prosperity had been improvised
by Potemkin, some of it was real. “That he constructed sham villages
along the banks, and marshaled the peasantry to create the illusion of
progress was the fantastic invention of a Saxon diplomatist.” 76 The
Prince de Ligne made several excur - sions ashore to see behind the
facades; he reported that while Potemkin had</p>
<p>460 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>used some legerdemain, he (Ligne) had been impressed by the “superb
estab - lishments in their infancy, growing manufactures, villages with
regular streets lined by trees.” 77 Catherine herself was probably not
deceived, but she m ay have concluded, as Segur did, that even if half
the prosperity and neatness of those towns was a passing show, the
actuality of Sevastopol — town, forts, and port, built on Crimean shores
in two years — was enough to merit Potemkin praise. The Prince de Ligne,
who had known almost everyone of account in Europe, called him “the most
extraordinary man I have ever met.” 78</p>
<p>At Kaniov Stanislas Poniatowski, king of Poland, came to offer his
homage to the woman who had given him her love and his throne. Farther
down the Dnieper, at Kaidaky, Joseph II joined the procession, which
thence went ov- erland to Kherson and into the Crimea. There the
Empress, the Emperor, and the Governor General fondled their dreams of
driving the Turks from Eu- rope: Catherine of capturing Constantinople,
Joseph of absorbing the Bal- kans, Potemkin of making himself king of
Dacia (Romania). England and Prussia advised Sultan Abdul-Hamid to
strike at the Russians while they were off guard, with their military
preparations incomplete. 79 The insolence of the Russian ambassador at
Constantinople provided an additional stimulus; the Sultan jailed him,
declared a holy war, and demanded the restoration of Cri- mea as the
price of peace. In August, 1787, the main Turkish army crossed the
Danube and marched into the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Potemkin had celebrated too soon; Russia was not yet prepared for the
ultimate test; he advised the Empress to surrender the Crimea. She
reproved him for his unwonted timidity; she ordered him, Suvorov, and
Rumiantsev to marshal all their available forces and go forth to meet
the invaders; she her- self retreated to St. Petersburg. Suvorov routed
the Turks at Kilburun, and Potemkin besieged Ochakov, which commanded
the outlets of both the Dniester and the Bug. While jihad and crusade
came face to face in South Russia, Sweden decided that now at last the
time had come to recapture her lost provinces. Encouraged by England and
Prussia, 80 Gustavus III renewed an old alliance with the Turks, and
demanded of Catherine the return of Fin- land and Karelia to Sweden, and
of the Crimea to Turkey. Of that war we may speak later; it is enough to
say here that on July 9, 1 799, a Swedish fleet decisively defeated the
Russians in the Baltic; the roar of Swedish cannon could be heard from
the Winter Palace; Catherine thought of evacuating her capital. Soon,
however, her agents persuaded Sweden to peace (August 15,</p>
<p>1790).</p>
<p>Now she was free to concentrate forces against the Turks, and Austria
joined Russia in the war. Potemkin ended the siege of Ochakov by
ordering his men to attack at whatever price; the victory cost the
Russians eight thou- sand lives; and the fury of battle ended in
indiscriminate massacre (Decem- ber 17, 1788). Potemkin went on to take
Bender, the Austrians captured Bel- grade, Suvorov routed the Turks at
Rimnik (September 22, 1789). Turkey seemed doomed.</p>
<p>The Western powers felt that the situation called for united action
against Catherine if the strategic Bosporus was not to fall into her
hands and make</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>Russia the master of Europe. Frederick the Great having died (1786),
his successor, Frederick William II, saw with dismay the movement of
Russia toward Constantinople, and of Austria into the Balkans; between
Russia and Austria so strengthened, Prussia would be at their mercy. On
January 31, 1790, he bound his government with the Porte in a pact that
committed him to declare war upon both Russia and Austria in the spring,
and not to lay down arms till all Turkey’s lost territory had been
restored.</p>
<p>The political tide seemed to be turning against Catherine. Revolt in
the Austrian Netherlands and disorder in Hungary weakened Joseph II; he
died on February 20, 1790, and his successor signed an armistice with
the Turks. England and Prussia again urged Catherine to make peace on
the basis of re- storing all terrain won in the war; she refused; the
capture of Ochakov had cleared Russian access to the Black Sea; she
would not surrender that vital gain. Moreover, her generals were moving
from victory to victory, culminat- ing in the capture of Izmail
(December 22, 1790) by Suvorov and Potemkin; in taking that Turkish
stronghold on the Danube the Russians lost ten thousand men, the Turks
thirty thousand. After that feast of blood Potem- kin, exhausted,
relapsed into luxurious indolence and shameless incest with his nieces;
and on October 15, 1791, he died on a road near Jassy. Catherine fainted
three times on the day that she heard of his death.</p>
<p>In March, 1791, William Pitt the Younger proposed to Parliament that
an ultimatum be dispatched to Russia requiring her to return to Turkey
all territory taken in the present conflict, and he prepared to send a
British fleet into the Baltic as a promise of war. Catherine made no
reply, and Parliament, hearing British merchants mourn the loss of
Russian trade, dissuaded Pitt from his enterprise. Turkey, exhausted,
gave up the struggle, and signed at Jassy (January 9, 1792) a treaty
that confirmed Russia’s control of the Crimea and the basins of the
Dniester and the Bug. Catherine had not reached Constantinople, but she
had risen to the zenith of her career as the most powerful ruler in
Europe, and the most remarkable woman of her century.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE WOMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>Was she a woman, or a monster? We have seen that at the beginning of
her reign she was physically attractive; by 1780 she had grown stout,
but this merely added weight to her majesty. The Prince de Ligne (who
was among the first to call her “the Great” 81 ) described her
gallantly:</p>
<p>She still [in 1780] looked well. One saw that she had been beautiful
rather than pretty…. It needed no Lavater to read on her forehead, as in
a book, genius, justice, courage, depth, equanimity, sweetness, calm,
and decision. Her fine bust had been acquired at the expense of her
waist, once so terribly thin; but people generally grow fat in Russia….
One never noticed that she was short. 82</p>
<p>Castera, writing shortly after her death, pictured her as modestly
dressed in a green robe. “Her hair, lightly powdered, floated over her
shoulders, and</p>
<p>462</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>was surmounted by a small cap covered with diamonds. In the last
years of her life she put on a great deal of rouge, for she still had
pretensions not to allow the traces of time to appear on her face; and
it is probable that only these pretensions were the cause of her living
in the utmost temperance.” 83</p>
<p>She was vain, visibly conscious of her accomplishments and her power.
“Vanity is her idol,” Joseph II told Kaunitz; “luck and exaggerated
compli - ments have spoiled her.” 84 Frederick the Great thought that if
Catherine were corresponding with God she would claim at least equal
rank. 85 Yet she talked with Diderot as “man to man,” and begged
Falconet to omit compli - ments. She was as amiable (barring a few
possible murders and the sanctified slaughters of war) as Charles II of
England and Henry IV of France. She daily threw from her windows bread
for the thousands of birds that came regularly to her to be fed. 88 In
the ending years of her reign she indulged now and then in fits of rage
unbefitting omnipotence, but she took care not to give an order or sign
a paper in these volcanic moods; soon she grew ashamed of such
outbursts, and schooled herself to self-control. As to her courage
Europe discarded all doubt.</p>
<p>She was unquestionably and imperturbably sensual, but her amours
offend us less than the Parc aux Cerfs of Louis XV. Like all the rulers
of her time she subordinated morality to politics, and suppressed
personal feelings when these impeded the aggrandizement of her state.
Where there was no such con- flict she had all the tenderness of a
woman, loving children, gamboling with them, teaching them, making toys
for them. On her tours she was always care- ful that drivers and
servants were properly fed. 87 Among the papers found on her table after
her death was an epitaph she had composed for herself: “She forgave
easily, and hated no one. Tolerant, understanding, of a gay disposi-
tion, she had a republican spirit and a kind heart.” 88</p>
<p>She was not kind to her first son; partly because Paul had been taken
from her soon after birth, and had been brought up by Panin and others
under Elizabeth’s sup ervision; partly because the conspiracies to
unseat her some- times proposed to make him emperor with a regency;
partly because Paul long suspected his mother as Peter’s murderer; and
also because Paul “was always brooding over the theft of his rights” to
succeed his presumptive fa - ther on the throne. But Catherine took to
her heart Paul’s charming sons Alexander and Constantine, personally
attended to their education, tried to alienate them from their father,
and schemed to have Alexander, not Paul, inherit her crown. 89 Paul,
happily mated with a second wife, looked with manifest disgust upon the
concatenation of paramours that amused his mother and drained the
revenues of the state.</p>
<p>Mentally Catherine surpassed all her favorites. She indulged their
greed, but rarely allowed them to determine her policy. She absorbed
French liter- ature to a point where she could correspond with its
leaders as ope philo- sophe to another; indeed, her letters to Voltaire
excelled his in good sense, and rivaled them in grace and wit. Her
correspondence was almost as volu- minous as Voltaire’s, though written
in the interstices of court intrigues, domestic insurrections, critical
diplomacy, and map-remaking wars. Her</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>463</p>
<p>conversation kept Diderot on his toes, and moved Grimm to ecstasy:
“One must have seen, at those moments, this singular head, composed of
genius and grace, to form an idea of the fire that swayed her, the
shafts that she let fly, the sallies that pressed… one upon another… Had
it only been in my power to take down these conversations literally, the
whole world would have possessed a precious and perhaps unique fragment
in the history of the human mind.” 90 There was, however, a hurried
confusion and instability in the torrent of her ideas; she plunged too
quickly into projects that she had not thought through, and she was
sometimes defeated by the urgency of events and the multiplicity of her
tasks. Even so, the result was immense.</p>
<p>It seems incredible that in a career of such political and military
excitement Catherine found time to write poems, chronicles, memoirs,
plays, opera librettos, magazine articles, fairy tales, a scientific
treatise on Siberia, a his - tory of the Roman emperors, and extensive
Notes on Russian History. In 1769-70 she edited anonymously a satirical
journal to which she was the chief contributor. One of her sketches
described a religious hypocrite who attended Mass every day, lit candles
before holy images, and mumbled prayers intermittently, but cheated
tradesmen, maligned neighbors, beat servants, denounced current
immorality, and mourned the good old da ys. 91 Catherine’s fairy tale
Prince Khlor told of a youth who went through perilous adven- tures to
find a fabled rose without thorns, only to discover in the end that
there was no such rose but virtue; this story became a classic in
Russian liter- ature, and was translated into many languages. Two of her
plays were his- torical tragedies imitating Shakespeare; most of them
were unpretentious comedies ridiculing charlatans, dupes, misers,
mystics, spendthrifts, Caglio- stro, Freemasons, religious fanatics;
these pieces lacked subtlety but they pleased the audiences, though
Catherine concealed her authorship. On the curtain of the theater that
she built in the Hermitage she placed an inscrip- tion, Ridendo castigat
mores — “He. chastizes manners with laughter”; this well expressed the
aim of her comedies. Oleg , the best of her dramas, was a remarkable
succession of scenes from Russian history, enlivened by seven hundred
performers in dances, ballets, and Olympic games. Most of Cathe- rine’s
literary work was revised by secretaries, for she never mastered Rus -
sian spelling or grammar, and she did not take herself too seriously as
an authoress; but literature took courage from the imperial example, and
gave a final and tarnished glory to her reign.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>LITERATURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Russia was becoming aware of its intellectual immaturity. A host of
au- thors humbly copied foreign models, or translated works that had won
fame in France, England, or Germany. Catherine allowed five thousand
rubles from her privy purse to further this exotic flow; she herself
translated Mar- montel’s Belisaire. With Russian enthusiasm for vast
enterprises, Rachmani - nov, a landowner in Tambov, translated the works
of Voltaire, and Verevkin,</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>director of the College of Kazan, turned into Russian the
Encyclopedic of Diderot. Others translated the plays of Shakespeare, the
Greek and Latin classics, the Gerusalenrme liberata of Tasso…</p>
<p>Gavril Romanovich Derzhavin was the most successful poet of the
reign. Born lowly in eastern Orenburg, with Tatar blood in his veins, he
served for ten years in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, saw Catheri ne’s
ride to power, took part as an officer in suppressing Pugachev’s revolt,
and worked his way up to a seat in the Senate. Noting that the Empress
had used the name Felitza for a benevolent princess in Prince Khlor,
Derzhavin, in a famous ode (1782), gave the same name to “the godlike
Queen of the Kirghiz -Kazakh horde,” and begged this sultana to “teach
me how to find the rose without thorns,… how to live pleasantly but
justly.” 92 When the poet apostro - phized Felitza as one “from whose
pen flows bliss to all mortals,” he was ob - viously extolling
Catherine. When he reproved himself for “sleeping till noon, smoking
tobacco, drinking coffee,… and making the world tremble with my looks,”
or indulging in “sumptuous feasts at a table spark ling with silver and
gold,” all the court knew that this was a hit at Potemkin. Derzhavin
rose to raptures in praising the “Empress” Felitza, who “creates light
from darkness,” injures no one, treats small faults forgivingly, lets
people speak freely, “writes fables for the instruction” of her people,
and “teaches the - zhavin protested that he wished no reward for
bringing so much honey, but Catherine promoted him, and soon he was so
close to her that he could see her faults; he wrote no more lauds. He
turned to a higher throne and indited an “Ode to the Deity,”
congratulating Him on being “three -in- one,” and on keeping the heavens
in such good order. At times he descended to meta- physics, and echoed
Descartes’ proof of God’s existence: “Surely I am, hence</p>
<p>Denis Ivanovich von Visin startled the capital with two lively
comedies: The Brigadier and The Minor. The success of the latter was so
complete that Potemkin advised the author to “die now, or never write
again”— i.e., anything further would dim his fame. 95 Visin rejected the
advice and saw its implied prophecy come true. In his later years he
traveled in Western Europe and sent home some excellent letters, one of
which contained a proud prediction: “We [t he Russians] are beginning;
they [the French] are end- ing-” 96</p>
<p>The most interesting figure in the literature of Catherine’s reign
was Niko - lai Ivanovich Novikov. Dismissed from the University of
Moscow for lazi- ness and backwardness, he developed into a man of
incessant intellectual ac- tivity. At the age of twenty-five (1769), in
St. Petersburg, he edited a magazine, The Drone, impishly so called to
counter Sumarokov’s periodical, The Industrious Bee. In lively style
Novikov attacked the corruption preva-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>lent in the government; he assailed the Voltairean irreligion of the
upper classes as destructive of morals and character; he lauded by
contrast what he supposed to have been the unquestioning faith and
exemplary morals of the Russians before Peter the Great. “It is as if
the old Russian rulers had fore - seen that, through the introduction of
arts and sciences, the most precious treasure of the Russians — their
morality — would be irretrievably lost”; 97 here too Rousseau was at war
with Voltaire. Catherine gave The Drone some sour looks, and it ceased
publication in 1770. In 1775 Novikov joined the Freemasons, who in
Russia were turning to mysticism, Pietism, and Rosicru- cian fancies
while their brothers in France were playing with revolution. In 1779 he
moved to Moscow, took charge of the university press, and pub- lished
more books in three years than had come from that press in twenty- four.
Financed by a friend, he acquired additional presses, formed a publish-
ing house, opened bookstores throughout Russia, and scattered broadcast
his gospel of religion and reform. He established schools, hospitals,
and dispen- saries, and model housing for workingmen.</p>
<p>When the French Revolution turned Catherine from an enlightened into
a frightened despot, she feared that Novikov was subverting the existing
order. She directed Platon, the Metropolitan of Moscow, to examine Novi-
kov’s ideas. The prelate reported: “I implore the all -merciful God that
there may be, not only in the flock entrusted to me by God and you but
through- out the world, such Christians as Novikov.” 98 Suspicious
nevertheless, the Empress ordered Novikov’s imprisonment in the fortress
of Schlusselburg (1792). There he remained till Catherine’s death.
Released by Paul I, he retired to his estate of Tikhvin, and passed his
remaining years in works of piety and charity.</p>
<p>A worse fate fell to Alexander Nikolaevich Radishchev. Sent by Cath-
erine to the University of Leipzig, he picked up some works of the
philo- sophes , and was especially moved by Rousseau’s Social Contract
and Raynal’s exposure of European brutality in colonial exploitation and
the slave trade. He returned to St. Petersburg fired with social ideals.
Put in charge of the customshouse, he learned English to deal with
British merchants, took up English literature, and was especially
influenced by Sterne’s Sentimental Journey. In 1790 he published one of
the classics of Russian literature, Jour- ney from St. Petersburg to
Moscow. It professed orthodoxy, but denounced the impositions of priests
upon popular credulity; it accepted monarchy but justified revolt
against a ruler who violate d the “social contract” by over - riding the
law. It described the dismemberment of families by conscription, and the
abuse of serfs by masters; at one place, said Radishchev, he had been
told of a landlord who had violated sixty peasant maidens. He denounced
censorship, and pleaded for freedom of the press. He did not advocate
revo- lution, but he asked for a merciful understanding of its
advocates. He ap- pealed to the nobles and the government to end
serfdom. “Let yourselves be softened, you hardhearted ones; break the
fetters of your brethren, open the dungeons of slavery. The peasant who
gives us health and life has a right to control the land which he
tills.” 99</p>
<p>Strange to say, the book was passed by the censor. But Catherine in
1790</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>was fearful that her people might imitate the French Revolution. She
made note to punish the violator of sixty virgins, but she ordered
Radishchev to be tried for treason. Passages were found in his book
about the storming of fortresses and the uprising of soldiers against a
cruel czar; and there were eulogies of the English for resisting an
unjust king. The Senate condemned the author to death; the Empress
commuted this to ten years in Siberia. Em- peror Paul I allowed
Radishchev to return from exile (1796); Alexander I invited him to
St. Petersburg (1801). There, a year later, thinking, without reason,
that he was to be banished again, he killed himself. His fate and that
of Novikov are among the many blots on a brilliant reign.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>ART</li>
</ol>
<p>Catherine did a little more for art than for literature, for art
appealed only to the upper classes, and sounded no tocsin of revolt.
Popular music, how- ever, was unwittingly revolutionary, for nearly all
of it consisted of sad songs, in a minor key and with plaintive
accompaniment, telling not only of hearts broken in love but of lives
worn out with toil. The nobles rarely heard those songs, but they
enjoyed the Italian operas that were brought to St. Petersburg by
Galuppi, Paisiello, Salieri, and Cimarosa, all paid by the state.
Catherine herself did not care much for opera. “In music,” she said, “I
can recognize no tones but those of my nine dogs, who in turn share the
honor of being in my room, and whose individual voices I can recognize
from a distance.” 100</p>
<p>She confessed, too, that she had no understanding of art. She did
what she could to develop such understanding in Russia. She provided the
funds with which Betsky set into actual functioning (1764) the Academy
of Arts that had been organized under Elizabeth (1757). She bought
acknowledged masterpieces abroad, and displayed them in her galleries;
so she gave 1 80,000 rubles for the collection of Count von Briihl in
Dresden, ,£40,000 for the collection of Sir Robert Walpole at Houghton
Hall, 440,000 francs for Choiseul’s collection, and 460,000 for
Crozat’s. Without knowing it, she made fine bargains, for these
gleanings included eleven hundred pieces by Raphael, Poussin, Vandyck,
Rembrandt, and other perennials, whose value has grown with the advance
of time and the retreat of currency. Through Grimm and Diderot (whose
Salons she followed carefully) she gave com- missions to French artists
— Vernet, Chardin, Houdon. She had life-size copies made of Raphael’s
frescoes in the Vatican, and built a special gallery for them in the
Hermitage.</p>
<p>She gave few commissions to native artists, for to her French taste
there was little of lasting worth in the Russian art of her time.
However, she pro- vided funds for the education and support of students
in the Academy of Arts, and sent several of them to study in Western
Europe. From that Academy came the history painter Anton Losenko and the
portrait painters Dmitri Levitsky and Vladimir Borovikovsky. After five
years in Paris and three in Rome, Losenko returned to St. Petersburg
(1769) to teach in the</p>

<p>Academy. He made a stir with Vladimir before Rogneda, but — perhaps
too burdened with academic duties — he failed to produce the
masterpieces ex- pected of him, and death took him at thirty-six (1773).
— Catherine em- ployed Levitsky to portray some of the young women who
were studying at the Smolny Institute; the result is a testimony to
their beauty. His portrait of Catherine concealed her amplitude under
flowing robes. She sat also for Mme. Vigee-Lebrun, who was one of many
French artists whom she invited to give Gallic grace to Russian art.</p>
<p>The greatest of her imported artists was Falconet. He came in 1766,
and stayed twelve years. Catherine asked him to design, and cast in
bronze, an equestrian statue of Peter the Great. He had brought with him
a young woman, Marie-Anne Collot, who modeled the colossal head.
Falconet dared the laws of physics by representing the horse as
springing into the air, with only its hind feet touching terra firma —
an immense boulder brought from Karelia to symbolize the massive
resistance that Peter had overcome; to se- cure equilibrium Falconet
showed a brass serpent — symbol of envy — biting the horse’s tail. This
chef - d’oeuvre kept its poise while St. Petersburg changed into
Petrograd and then into Leningrad. Falconet took longer with this work
than Catherine had expected; she lost interest in it, and neglected the
sculptor, who returned to Paris disappointed with her, Russia, and life.
In 1758 Nicolas-Frangois Gillet came from France to teach sculpture at
the Academy. Three of his pupils achieved excellence in Catherine’s
reign: Chubin, Kozlovsky, and Shchedrin. Chubin was commissioned by
Potemkin to carve a Catherine 11 for the rotunda of the Taurida Palace;
experts called it “lifeless and cold”; 101 so too seems t he statue
Chubin made of Potemkin. Kozlovsky achieved similar rigidity in his tomb
for Marshal Suvorov, and even in his Cupid. Shchedrin’s main work was
done under Alexander I: to 1812 belongs the Caryatids Holding Up the
Celestial Sphere — woman bears the world. Ivan Petrovich Martos
specialized in funerary monuments; ceme- teries in St. Petersburg were
peopled with his pleurants; “he made marble weep.” Native sculpture
lagged except in imitation of foreign styles. Ortho - dox churches
excluded statuary, and the nobles were content with such artists as they
found among their serfs.</p>
<p>But architecture flourished under Catherine, for she was resolved to
leave her mark upon her capital. “Great buildings,” she said, “declare
the greatness of a reign no less eloquently than great actions.” 102
“You know,” she wrote in 1779, “that the mania for building is stronger
with us than ever, and no earthquake ever demolished as many structures
as we have set up…. This mania is an infernal thing; it runs away with
money, and the more one builds, the more one wants to build; it is a
disease, like drunkenness.” 103 Though she told Falconet, “I can’t even
draw,” she had her own mind in art, or a mind influenced by the Roman
excavations at Herculaneum and the books of Caylus and Winckelmann. She
turned her back upon the ornate baroque and flowery rococo that had
reigned under Elizabeth, and cast her vote for the chaster neoclassic
style. Some contemporaries credited her with providing explicit
instructions and preliminary sketches for her architects. 104 Finding no
native artists who could realize her conceptions, she called to</p>
<p>468</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Western Europe for men who had inherited the classical tradition. So
came Jean-Baptiste Vallin de La Mothe, who built for her on the Neva the
Palace of the Academy of Arts (1765-72) — a Renaissance facade of coated
bricks and classic portico, and, within, a majestic semicircular
stairway leading to a rotunda under a dome. As an adjunct to the Winter
Palace Vallin built the famous Hermitage, which Catherine thought of as
a refuge from court eti- quette, but which became her art gallery, and
is now one of the principal museums of the world. Catherin e described
it to Grimm in 1790 as “my little retreat, so situated that to go there
and back from my room is just three thousand paces. There I walk about
amid a quantity of things that I love and delight in, and those winter
walks are what keep me in h ealth.” 105</p>
<p>From France, too, came the Scot Charles Cameron, who had studied
classic ornament there. Catherine was delighted with the brilliance and
delicacy with which he adorned — with silver, lacquer, glass, jasper,
agate, and poly- chrome marble — the private apartment that she reserved
for herself, her lovers, and her dogs in the Grand Palace at Tsarskoe
Selo. “I have never seen the equal of these newly decorated rooms,” she
wrote; “during the last nine weeks I have never tired of contemplating t
hem.” 106 Around this palace she had a park designed in the “natural”
and “English” style, which she de - scribed in a letter to Voltaire: “I
now madly love the jar dins a I’anglaise, the short lines, the curved
lines, the gently graded slopes, the pools and lakes…. I have a profound
aversion to straight lines; in a word, Anglomania dominates my
plantomania.” 107 For her son Paul and his lovely second wife Cameron
built in Pavlovsk (another suburb of the capital) a palace in Italian
villa style; here the Grand Duke and Maria Feodorovna housed the art
col- lected in their West-European tours.</p>
<p>From Italy came Antonio Rinaldi, who raised two luxurious mansions as
gifts from Catherine to Grigori Orlov: the Marble Palace on the Neva,
and, near Tsarskoe Selo, the Gatchina Palace, which became the favorite
resi- dence of Paul I. And from Italy came Giacomo Quarenghi, who had
been fascinated by the Greek temples at Paestum and the masterpieces of
Palladio in Vicenza. In 1780 he submitted to Catherine, through Grimm,
plans and models for various structures that he hoped to build.
Catherine was attracted, and from that date till 1815 Quarenghi raised,
in or near St. Petersburg, a profusion of buildings in classic style:
the theater of the Hermitage, the Smolny Institute (which he added to
the Smolny Monastery of Rastrelli), the Bank of the Empire, the Chapel
of the Malta Order, the English Palace at Peterhof, and the Alexander
Palace at Tsarskoe Selo. This was designed for Catherine’s grandson the
future Alexander I, who moved into it in 1793, two years after its
completion. “It is one of the masterpieces of eighteenth - century
architecture.” 108 *</p>
<p>But were there no Russian architects fit to spend Ca therine’s
rubles? Yes. Hoping to leave a monument to her memory at Moscow, she
commissioned</p>

<p>CATHERINE THE GREAT</p>
<p>469</p>
<p>Vasili Bazhenev to design a stone Kremlin to replace the brick
Kremlin of Ivan the Great. Bazhenev conceived an immensity that would
have dwarfed Versailles; those who saw the wooden model — which itself
cost sixty thou- sand rubles — marveled at its architectural excellence.
But the foundations laid for it sank as the soil subsided through the
action of the Moscow River, and Catherine withdrew from the enterprise.
However, she found funds that enabled Ivan Starov to build, on the left
bank of the Neva, the Taurida Palace; this splendor she presented to
Potemkin to commemorate his con- quest of the Crimea.</p>
<p>Whatever the cost of her buildings, Catherine achieved her object.
The contemporary Masson wrote: “A Frenchman, after winding along the
inhos - pitable shores of Prussia and traversing the wild and
uncultivated plains of Livonia, is struck with astonishment and rapture
at finding again, in the midst of a vast desert, a large and magnificent
city, in which the society, amusements, arts and luxuries abound which
he had supposed to exist no- where but in Paris.” 109 And the Prince de
Ligne, after seeing nearly all Eu - rope, concluded that “in spite of
Catherine’s shortcomings her public and private edifices make
St. Petersburg the finest city in the world.” 110 The flesh and blood of
ten million peasants had been turned into brick and stone.</p>

<p>Catherine, like rulers throughout the ages, would have explained that
since men must die in any case, why should not genius be employed by
statesmen to direct those harassed lives and certain deaths to making
the country strong and its cities great? Years of power, the challenges
of revolt and war, the fluctuations of victory and defeat, had
accustomed her to bear unflinchingly the sufferings of others, and to
turn aside from the exploitation of the weak by the strong as beyond her
means to cure.</p>
<p>Disturbed by a dozen conspiracies to unseat her, and frightened
by</p>
<p>Pugachev’s revolt, she was terrified by the French Revolution. She
bore with it complacently when it promised to be only the overthrow of
an idle aris- tocracy and an incompetent government; but when a Paris
mob forced Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to leave Versailles and live
in the Tuileries amid an unchained populace — when the Constituent
Assembly declared itself su- preme, and Louis consented to be merely its
executive officer — Catherine shuddered at the encouragement so given to
those who sought similar action in Russia. She allowed the clergy to
forbid the publication of her once be- loved Voltaire’s works (1789);
111 she herself soon proscribed all French pub - lications; she had the
busts of Voltaire removed from her chambers to a lumber room (1792). 112
She banished the idealistic Radishchev (1790), im- prisoned the
public-spirited Novikov (1792), and established an inquisitorial
censorship over literature and plays. When Louis XVI and Marie
Antoinette were guillotined (1793) she broke off all relations with the
French govern- ment, and urged the European monarchies to form a
coalition against France.</p>
<p>470</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>She herself did not join in that coalition; she used it to keep the
Western powers busy while she completed her absorption of Poland. “Many
of my enterprises are unfinished,” she told one of her diplomats; “the
courts of Berlin and Vienna must be occupi ed so as to leave us
unfettered.” 113</p>
<p>Some vestiges of her early liberalism survived till 1793. In that
year a courtier reported to her that Frederic-Cesar de Laharpe, who had
been tutor- ing her grandsons, was an unregenerate republican. She sent
for him and told him of the report; he answered: “Your Majesty knew,
before entrusting me with the education of the Grand Dukes, that I was a
Swiss, and therefore a republican.” He asked her to examine his pupils,
and from their conduct judge his work. But she already knew how well he
had taught them. “Mon - sieur,” she said, “be a Jacobin, a republican,
or what you please; I believe you are an honest man, and that is enough
for me. Stay with my grandchildren, retain my complete confidence, and
instruct t hem with your wonted zeal.” 114</p>
<p>Amid the turmoil she took her last lover (1789). Platon Zubov was</p>
<p>wenty-five, she was sixty-one. She wrote to her amant-en-titre ,
Potemkin: “I have returned to life like a fly that the cold had
benumbed.” 115 Her new “pupil” proposed a three -pronged attack upon
Turkey: a Russian army under his twenty-four-year-old brother Valerian
was to cross the Caucasus into Persia and shut off all overland trade
between Turkey and the East; an- other army, under Suvorov, was to go
through the Balkans to besiege Con- stantinople; and Russia’s new Black
Sea Fleet, led by the Empress herself, was to capture control of the
Bosporus. After years of preparation this epic enterprise was begun
(1796); Derbent and Baku were taken; and Catherine looked forward to
victories that would complete her program and crown her career.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 17, 1796, she seemed as gay as ever. After
breakfast she retired to her room. As time passed and she did not
reappear, her female attendants knocked at the door. Receiving no
answer, they en- tered. They found the Empress stretched out on the
floor, the victim of the rupture of an artery in the brain. She was
twice bled, and for a moment re- covered consciousness, but she could
not speak. At ten o’clock that evening she died.</p>
<p>Her enemies felt that she had not deserved so merciful a death. They
never forgave her the contradictions between her liberal professions and
her abso- lutist rule, her intolerance of opposition, her failure to
carry out her pro- posed reform of Russian law, her surrender to the
nobility in her extension of serfdom. Families impoverished by high
taxes, or mourning the loss of sons in her wars, did not thank her for
her victories. But the people as a whole applauded her for expanding
Russia to wider and safer boundaries. She had added 200,000 square miles
to Russia’s area, had opened new ports to Russia’s trade, had raised the
population from nineteen to thirty -six mil- lion souls. She had been
unscrupulous in her diplomacy — perhaps, in her absorption of Poland, a
little more so than most other rulers of that time.</p>
<p>Her greatest achievement lay in carrying on the efforts of Peter the
Great to bring Russia into Western civilization. Whereas Peter had
thought of</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII ) CATHERINE THE GREAT 47 1</p>
<p>his chiefly in terms of technology, Catherine thought of it
principally in terms of culture; by the force and courage of her
personality she drew the literate classes of Russia out of the Middle
Ages into the orbit of modern thought in literature, philosophy,
science, and art. She was ahead of her Christian compeers (excepting the
un-Christian Frederick II) in establishing religious toleration. A
French historian compared her favorably with Le Grand Monarque:</p>
<p>The generosity of Catherine, the splendor of her reign, the
magnificence of her court, her institutions, her monuments, her wars,
were precisely to Russia what the age of Louis XIV was to Europe; but,
considered individually, Cath- erine was greater than this Prince. The
French formed the glory of Louis; Catherine formed that of the Russians.
She had not, like him, the advantage of reigning over a polished people;
nor was she surrounded from infancy by great and accomplished
characters. 116</p>
<p>In the estimate of an English historian Catherine was “the only woman
ruler who has surpassed England’s Elizabeth in ability, and equaled her
in the en - during significance of her wor k.” 117 “She was,” said a
German historian, “every inch a ‘political being,’ unmatched by anyone
of her sex in modern history, and yet at the same time a thorough woman
and a great lady.” 118 We may apply to her the magnanimous principle
laid down by Goethe: her faults were an infection from her time, but her
virtues were her own.</p>
