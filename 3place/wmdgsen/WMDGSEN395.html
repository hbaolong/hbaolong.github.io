<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>Venice and Her Realm</p>
<p>I 378-i534</p>
<p>I. PADUA</p>
<p>U NDER the dictatorship of the Carraresi Padua was a major
Italian</p>
<p>power, rivaling and threatening Venice. In 1378 Padua joined</p>
<p>Genoa in attempting to subjugate the island republic. In 1380 Venice,
ex- hausted by her war with Genoa, ceded to the duke of Austria the city
of Treviso, strategically situated on her north. In 1383 Francesco I da
Carrara bought Treviso from Austria; soon afterward he tried to take
Vicenza, Udine, and Friuli; had he succeeded he would have commanded the
roads from Venice to her iron mines at Agordo, and the routes of
Venetian trade with Germany; i.e., Padua would have controlled vital
sources of Venetian industry and commerce. Venice was saved by the skill
of her diplomats. They persuaded Giangaleazzo Visconti to join Venice in
war against</p>
<p>Padua; Gian, while doubtless distrusting Venice, seized the
opportunity to extend his frontier eastward with Venetian connivance.
Francesco I da Carrara was defeated and abdicated (1389); and his son,
namesake, and suc- cessor renewed (1399) a treaty of 1338 that had
acknowledged Padua to be a dependency of Venice. When Francesco II da
Carrara resumed the struggle and attacked Verona and Vicenza, Venice
declared war to the death, captured and executed him and his sons, and
brought Padua under direct rule by the Venetian Senate (1405). The weary
city abandoned the luxury of a native exploiter, prospered under an
alien but competent ad- ministration, and became the educational center
of the Venetian domain. From all quarters of Latin Christendom students
came to its renowned uni- versity — Pico della Mirandola, Ariosto,
Bembo, Guicciardini, Tasso, Gali- leo, Gustavus Vasa who would be King
of Sweden, John Sobieski who would be King of Poland. . . . The chair of
Greek was founded in 1463 and occupied by Demetrius Chalcondyles sixteen
years before he went to Florence. A century later Shakespeare could
still speak of “Fair Padua, nursery of arts.”</p>
<p>One Paduan was himself a famous educational institution. Trained as
a</p>
<p>VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>28l</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>tailor, Francesco Squarcione developed a passion for classic art,
traveled widely in Italy and Greece, copied or sketched Greek and Roman
sculp- ture and architecture, collected ancient medals, coins, and
statuary, and returned to Padua with one of the best classical
collections of his time. He opened a school of art, installed his
collection there, and gave his pupils two main directives: to study
ancient art and the new science of perspective. Few of the 137 artists
whom he formed remained in Padua, since most of them came from outside.
But in return Giotto came from Florence to paint the Arena frescoes;
Altichiero came from Verona ( c . 1376) to adorn a chapel in
St. Anthony’s; and Donatello left memorials of his genius in the
cathedral and its square. Bartolommeo Bellano, a pupil of Donatello, set
up two lovely female statues for Gattamelata’s chapel in the same
church; Pietro Lombardo of Venice added a fine figure of the
condottiere* s son, and a splendid tomb for Antonio P.oselli. Andrea
Briosco — “Riccio” — and An- tonio and Tullio Lombardo carved for the
Gattamelata chapel some superb marble reliefs; and Riccio set up in the
choir of the church one of the most imposing candelabra in Italy. He
shared with Alessandro Leopardi of Venice and Andrea Morone of Bergamo
in designing the unfinished church of Santa Giustina (i502f), a chaste
example of the Renaissance architec- tural style.</p>
<p>It was from Padua and Verona that Iacopo Bellini and Antonio
Pisanello brought to Venice the seeds of that Venetian school of
painting through which the splendor of Venice was blazoned to the
world.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>VENETIAN ECONOMY AND POLICY</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1378 Venice was at nadir: her Adriatic trade was bottled up by a
vic- torious Genoese fleet, her communications with the mainland were
blocked by Genoese and Paduan troops, her people were starving, her
government contemplated surrender. Half a century later she ruled Padua,
Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Bergamo, Treviso, Belluno, Feltre, Friuli,
Istria, the Dal- matian coast, Lepanto, Patras, and Corinth. Secure in
her many-moated citadel, she seemed immune to the political vicissitudes
of the Italian main- land; her wealth and power mounted until she sat
like a throned queen at the head of Italy. Philippe de Comines, arriving
as French ambassador in 1495, pictured her as “the most triumphant city
that I have ever seen.” 1 Pietro Casola, coming from hostile Milan about
the same time, found it “im - possible to describe the beauty,
magnificence, and wealth” 2 of this unique assemblage of 117 islands,
150 canals, 400 bridges, all dominated by the</p>
<p>282 THE RENAISSANCE ( CHAP. XI</p>
<p>flowing promenade of the Grand Canal, which the traveled Comines pro-
nounced “the most beautiful street in the world.”</p>
<p>Whence came the wealth that supported this magnificence? Partly from
a hundred industries — shipbuilding, iron manufactures, glass blowing,
leather dressing and tooling, gem cutting and setting, textiles … all
or- ganized in proud guilds ( scuole ) that united master and man in
patriotic fellowship. But perhaps more of Venetian opulence came from
the mer- cantile marine whose sails flapped on the lagoons, whose
galleys took the products of Venice and her mainland dependencies, and
the German and other wares that scaled the Alps, and carried them to
Egypt, Greece, By- zantium, and Asia, and returned from the East with
silks, spices, rugs, drugs, and slaves. The exports of an average year
were valued at 10,000,000 duc- ats (50,000,000? ); 3 no other city in
Europe could equal this trade. The Venetian vessels could be seen in a
hundred ports, from Trebizond in the Black Sea to Cadiz, Lisbon, London,
Bruges, even in Iceland. 4 On the Rialto, the commercial center of
Venice, merchants could be seen from half the globe. Marine insurance
covered this traffic, and a tax on imports and exports was the mainstay
of the state. The annual income of the Ve- netian government in 1455 was
800,000 ducats (0,000,000?); in the same year the revenue of Florence
was some 200,000 ducats, of Naples 310,000, of the Papal States 400,000,
of Milan 500,000, of all Christian Spain, 800, ooo. 5</p>
<p>This commerce dictated the policies, as it so largely financed the
opera- tions, of the Venetian Republic. It raised to power a mercantile
aristocracy that made itself hereditary and controlled all the organs of
the state. It kept a population of 190,000 (in 1422) profitably
employed, but it left them dependent upon foreign markets, materials,
and food. Imprisoned in her labyrinth, Venice could feed her people only
by importing food; she could supply her industries only by importing
lumber, metals, minerals, leather, cloth; and she could pay for these
imports only by finding markets for her products and her trade.
Dependent on the mainland for food, out- lets, and raw materials, she
fought a succession of wars to establish her con- trol over northeastern
Italy; dependent likewise on non-Italian areas, she was anxious to
dominate the regions that supplied her wants, the markets that took her
goods, the routes by which her vital commerce passed. She became by
“manifest destiny” an imperialistic power.</p>
<p>So the political history of Venice turned on her economic needs. When
the Scaligeri at Verona, or the Carraresi at Padua, or the Visconti at
Milan attempted to spread their sway over northeastern Italy, Venice
felt en-</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 283</p>
<p>dangered and took to arms. Fearful that Ferrara might control the
mouths of the Po, she tried to determine the choice or policy of the
ruling marquis there, and resented the claims of the papacy to Ferrara
as its fief. Her own westward expansion angered Milan, which had
expansive ideas of its own. When Filippo Maria Visconti attacked
Florence (1423), the Tuscan Re- public appealed to Venice for aid, and
pointed out that a Milan master over Tuscany would soon absorb all Italy
north of the Papal States. In a debate often repeated in history, Doge
Tommaso Mocenigo, dying, pled in the Venetian Senate the cause of peace;
Francesco Foscari argued for an of- fensive war of defense; Foscari won,
and Venice began with Milan a series of wars that lasted, with some
lucid intervals, from 1425 to 1454. The death of Filippo Maria (1447),
the chaos of the Ambrosian Republic in Milan, and the capture of
Constantinople by the Turks inclined the rival states to sign at Lodi a
treaty that left the island Republic exhausted but victorious.</p>
<p>Her expansion in the Adriatic began with a legitimate excuse. Her
geo- graphical position as the northernmost port of the Mediterranean
was the fortune of Venice, but it was of no worth without control of the
Adriatic. The eastern coast offered in its isles and bays convenient
lairs for pirate vessels, whose raids were a frequent loss and constant
peril to Venetian shipping. When Venice bribed the Crusaders to help her
take Zara in 1202, she acquired a post from which year by year to clear
out these pi- rate nests, until all the Dalmatian coast accepted her
sovereignty. When those same Crusaders raped Constantinople (1204),
Venice received, as her share of the spoils, Crete, Salonika, the
Cyclades, and the Sporades, precious links in a golden chain of trade.
With leisurely pertinacity she took Du- razzo, the Albanian coast, the
Ionian Islands (1386-92), Friuli and Istria (1418-20), Ravenna (1441);
she was now indisputably Queen of the Adri- atic, and charged tolls to
all non-Venetian vessels plying that sea.® As the advance of the Ottoman
Turks toward Constantinople made it difficult for that capital to defend
the outlying possessions of Byzantium, many Greek islands and cities
submitted themselves to Venice as the only power ready to protect them.
In Cyprus a stately queen, Caterina Cornaro, last of the Lusignan line,
was persuaded that she could not hold her island against the Turks; she
abdicated in favor of a Venetian governor (1489) and a Vene- tian
pension of 8000 ducats a year; she retired to an estate at Asolo, near
Treviso, set up an unofficial court, patronized literature and art, and
became the subject or dedicatee of poems and operas, and paintings by
Gentile Bellini, Titian, and Veronese.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>(CHAP. Xt</p>
<p>All these laborious conquests of diplomacy or arms, these outlets,
guard- ians, and tributaries of Venetian trade faced in their turn the
rising tide of the Ottomans. At Gallipoli (1416) a Turkish garrison
attacked a Venetian fleet; the Venetians fought with their usual courage
and won a decisive victory; for a generation the rival powers lived in a
truce and commercial amity that shocked a Europe anxious to have Venice
fight Europe’s battle</p>
<p>in. VENETIAN GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>Even her enemies admired her government, and sent agents to study its
structure and functioning. Its military organs were the most efficient
navy and army in Italy. Besides her merchant fleet, which in need could
be con- verted to men-of-war, Venice had in 1423 a navy of forty-three
galleys and 300 auxiliary vessels. 7 These were used even in wars with
land powers in Italy; in 1439 they were dragged overland on rollers
across mountains and valleys to be launched on the Lago di Garda, where
they bombarded the possessions of Milan. 8 While other Italian states
still waged their wars with mercenaries, Venice built her army around a
militia of her own loyal pop- ulation, well seasoned and trained, and
armed with the latest muskets and artillery. For generals, however, she
relied on condottieri schooled in the Renaissance style of campaign by
strategy. In her wars with Milan Venice developed the talents of three
famous condottieri: Francesco Carmagnola,</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 285</p>
<p>Erasmo da Narni “Gattamelata,” and Bartolommeo Colleoni; the last two
distinguished by historic statues, the other by having his head cut off,
in the Venetian Piazzetta, on a charge of privately negotiating with the
enemy.</p>
<p>This government, which even Florentines sought to emulate, was a</p>
<p>closed oligarchy of old families so long enriched by commerce that
only the initiate could smell the money in their nobility. These
families had managed to restrict membership in the Maggior Consiglio to
male descend- ants of persons who had sat in this Great Council before
1297. In 1315 the names of all eligibles were inscribed in a Libro
d’oro, or Book of Gold. Out of its 480 members the Council named sixty —
later 120 — Pregadi (“invited men”) to serve in yearly terms as a
legislative Senate; it appointed the heads of the numerous governmental
departments, who together constituted an administrative Colie gio; and
it selected as chief executive — always subject to the Council — a doge
or leader who presided over it and the Senate, and held office for life
unless the Council cared to depose him. The doge was aided by six privy
councilors, who with him composed the Signoria. This Signory and the
Senate were in practice the real government of Venice; the Great Council
proved too large for effective action, and became a body of electors
exercising appointive and supervisory powers. It was an efficient
constitution, which normally maintained the people in a reasonable
degree of prosperity; and it was capable of long-term and well
calculated policies that might have been impossible in a government
subject to the fluctuations of public emotion or sentiment. The great
majority of the population, though excluded from office, showed no
active resentment against the rul- ing minority. In 1310a group of
excluded nobles under Bajamante Tiepolo rose in revolt; and in 1355 Doge
Marino Faliero conspired to make himself dictator. Both attempts were
easily suppressed.</p>
<p>To guard against internal or external conspiracies, the Maggior
Consiglio yearly chose from its membership a Council of Ten as a
committee of pub- lic safety. Through its secret sessions and trials,
its spies and swift pro- cedure, this Consiglio di Died became for a
time the most powerful body in the government. Ambassadors often
reported to it secretly, and held its instructions more binding than
those of the Senate; and any edict of the Ten had the full force of law.
Two or three of its members were dele- gated, each month, as Inquisitori
di stato, to search among the people and the officials for any suspicion
of malfeasance or treason. Many legends arose around this Council of
Ten, usually exaggerating its secrecy and severity. It published its
decisions and sentences to the Great Council;</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>though it allowed secret denunciations to be placed in the mouths of
lions’ heads scattered about the city, it refused to consider any
unsigned charges, or any that did not offer two witnesses; 9 and even
then a four-fifths vote was required before the accusation could be put
on the agenda. 10 Any per- son arrested had the right to choose two
counsel for his defense before the Ten. 11 A condemnatory sentence had
to receive a majority vote on five successive ballots. The number of
persons imprisoned by the Ten was “very small.” 12 However, it was not
above arranging the assassination of spies, and of enemies of Venice in
foreign states. 13 In 1582 the Senate, feel- ing that the Council had
served its purpose and had often exceeded its authority, reduced its
powers; and from that date the Council of Ten ex- isted only in
name.</p>
<p>The forty judges appointed by the Great Council provided an efficient
and severe judiciary. The laws were clearly formulated, and were
strictly enforced against nobles and commoners alike. Penalties
reflected the cruelty of the times. Imprisonment was often in narrow
cells admitting a minimum of light and air. Flogging, branding,
mutilation, blinding, cut- ting out the tongue, breaking limbs on the
wheel, and other delicacies were included among legal punishments.
Persons condemned to death could be strangled in jail, or secretly
drowned, or hanged from a window of the Doges’ Palace, or burned at the
stake. Persons guilty of atrocious crimes or sacrilegious theft were
tortured with red-hot pincers, dragged along the streets by a horse, and
then beheaded and quartered. 14 As if to compensate for this ferocity,
Venice opened her doors to political and intellectual refu- gees, and
dared to shelter Elisabetta Gonzaga and her Guidobaldo against the
terrible Borgia, when her sister-in-law Isabella had been frightened
into letting her depart from her native Mantua.</p>
<p>The administrative organization was probably the best in Europe in
the fifteenth century, though corruption found openings here as in every
gov- ernment. A bureau of public sanitation was established in 1385;
measures were taken to provide clean drinking water and to prevent the
formation of swamps. Another bureau fixed the maximum prices that might
be charged for food. A postal and courier service was set up not only
for the government but also for private correspondence and parcel
transporta- tion. 15 Retired public servants were pensioned, and
provision was made for their widows and orphans. 16 The administration
of dependent territories on the Italian mainland was relatively so just
and competent that these dis- tricts prospered better under Venetian
rule than ever before, and readily returned to Venetian allegiance after
being detached from it by the chances of war. 17 Venetian administration
of overseas dependencies was not so</p>
<p>VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>laudable; they were used chiefly as prizes of war, much of their soil
was awarded to Venetian noblemen and generals, and the native
population, while retaining their local institutions of government,
seldom reached the higher offices. In her relations with other states
Venice was especially well served by her diplomats. Few governments
possessed such acute observers and intelligent negotiators as Bernardo
Giustiniani. Guided by the in- formed reports of her ambassadors, the
careful statistical records of her bureaucracy, and the astute
statesmanship of her senators, Venice repeat- edly won in diplomacy what
she had lost in war. 18</p>
<p>Morally this government was no better than the others of the time, in
penal legislation worse. It made and broke alliances according to
fluctua- tions of advantage, allowing no scruple, no sentiment of
fidelity, to hamper policy: such was the code of all Renaissance powers.
The citizens readily accepted this code; they approved every Venetian
victory, however won; they gloried in the strength and stability of
their state, and offered it, in its need, a patriotism and fullness of
service unmatched among their contem- poraries. They honored the doge
only next to God.</p>
<p>The doge was usually the agent, quite exceptionally the master, of
the Council and the Senate; his splendor far outshone his power. In his
public appearances he was clothed in magnificent raiment and was heavy
with gems; his official bonnet alone contained jewels to the value of
194,000 ducats (, 850, 000?). 19 Venetian painters may have learned from
his garb the gorgeous colors that flowed from their brushes; and some of
their most brilliant portraits are of doges in official robes. Venice
believed in cere- mony and display, partly to impress ambassadors and
visitors, partly to awe the population, partly to give it pageantry in
place of power. Even the dogaressa received a sumptuous coronation. The
doge received foreign dignitaries, and signed all important documents of
state; his influence was pervasive and continuous through his lifelong
tenure amid persons elected for a year; in theory, however, he was
merely the servant and spokesman of the government.</p>
<p>A long and colorful succession of doges marches through Venetian his-
tory, but only a few impressed their personalities upon the character or
fortunes of the state. Despite the dying eloquence of Tommaso Mocenigo,
the Great Council chose the expansionist Francesco Foscari to succeed
him. Coming to the throne at the age of fifty, the new Doge, in a reign
of thirty- four years (1423-57), carried Venice through blood and
turmoil to the zenith of her power. Milan was defeated, Bergamo,
Brescia, Cremona, Crema were won. But the growing autocracy of the
victorious Doge</p>
<p>aroused the jealousy of the Ten. They charged him with having won
his</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>election by bribery; and unable to prove this they accused his son
Iacopo of treasonable communication with Milan (1445). Under the agony
of the wheel Iacopo admitted or pretended his guilt. He was exiled to
Rumania, but was soon permitted to live near Treviso. In 1450 one of the
Inquisitors of the Ten was assassinated; Iacopo was credited with the
crime; he denied it even under extreme torture; he was exiled to Crete,
where he went mad with loneliness and grief. In 1456 he was brought back
to Venice, charged again with secret correspondence with the government
of Milan; he ad- mitted it, was tortured to the verge of death, and was
returned to Crete, where he died soon afterward. The old Doge, who had
borne the perils and responsibilities of a long and unpopular war with
stoic fortitude, broke down before these trials, which not all his
dignity could prevent. At</p>
<p>eighty-six he became incapable of carrying the burdens of his office;
he was deposed by the Great Council with a life annuity of 2000 ducats.
He retired to his home, and there, a few days later, he died of a burst
blood vessel as the bells of the campanile announced the accession of a
new doge.</p>
<p>Foscari’s victories had earned Venice the hatred of all the Italian
states; none could any longer feel secure in the nearness of her
grasping power. A dozen combinations were formed against her; finally
(1508) Ferrara, Mantua, Julius II, Ferdinand of Spain, Louis XII of
France, and the Em- peror Maximilian joined in the League of Cambrai to
destroy her. Leo- nardo Loredano (1 501-21) was Doge in that crisis; he
led the people through it with an incredible tenacity only partly
revealed in the handsome portrait of him by Giovanni Bellini. Nearly all
that Venice had won on the mainland by a century of forceful expansion
was taken from her; Ven- ice herself was surrounded. Loredano minted his
plate; the aristocracy brought forth its hidden wealth to finance
resistance; the armorers forged a hundred thousand weapons; and every
man armed himself to fight for island after island in what seemed to be
a hopeless cause. Miraculously, Venice saved herself, and recovered part
of her mainland realm. But the effort exhausted her finances and her
spirit; and when Loredano died — though fifty-seven years of Titian, and
most of Tintoretto and Veronese, were still to come — Venice knew that
in wealth and power her zenith and glory had passed.</p>

<li>VENETIAN LIFE</li>
</ol>
<p>The last decades of the fifteenth century, and the early decades of
the sixteenth, were the period of greatest splendor in Venetian life.
The profits</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 289</p>
<p>of a world trade that had made its peace with the Turks, and had not
yet suffered severe curtailment from the rounding of Africa or the
opening of the Atlantic, poured into the islands, crowned them with
churches, walled the canals with palaces, filled the palaces with
precious metals and costly furniture, glorified the women with finery
and jewelry, supported a bril- liant galaxy of painters, and overflowed
in bright festivals of tapestried gondolas, masked liaisons, and
babbling waters echoing with song.</p>
<p>The life of the lower classes was the normal routine of toil, eased
by Italian leisureliness and loquacity, and the inability of the rich to
monop- olize any but the most perfumed delights of love. Every
humpbacked bridge, and the Grand Canal, teemed with men transporting the
products of half the world. There were more slaves here than in other
European cities; they were imported, chiefly from Islam, not as laborers
but as do- mestic servants, personal guards, wet nurses, concubines.
Doge Pietro Mocenigo, at the age of seventy, kept two Turkish slaves for
his sexual entertainment. 20 One Venetian record tells of a priest who
sold a female slave to another priest, who on the following day had the
contract annulled because he had found her with child. 21</p>
<p>The upper classes, though so well served, were not idlers. Most of
them, in their mature years, were active in commerce, finance,
diplomacy, gov- ernment, or war. The portraits we have of them show men
rich in con- scious personality, proud of their place, but also serious
with a sense of obligation. - A minority of them dressed in silks and
furs, perhaps to please the artists who painted them; and a set of young
bloods — La Compagnia della Scalza, “the Company of the Hose”— flaunted
tight doublets, silk brocades, and striped hose embroidered with gold or
silver or inset with gems. But every young patrician sobered his dress
when he became a member of the Great Council; then he was required to
wear a toga, for by a robe almost any male may be endowed with dignity,
and any woman with mystery. Occasionally, in their magnificent palaces,
or in their villa gardens at Murano or other suburbs, the nobles
betrayed their secret wealth to lav- ishly entertain a visitor, or to
celebrate some vital event in the history of their city or their family.
When Cardinal Grimani, high in both the no- bility and the Church, gave
a reception for Ranuccio Farnese (1542), he invited three thousand
guests; most of them came in cabined gondolas smoothed with velvet and
eased with cushions; and he provided them with music, acrobatics,
ropewalking, dancing, and dinner. Normally, however, the Venetian
nobility in this period lived, ate, and dressed in moderate style, and
earned some fraction of their keep.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Perhaps the middle classes were the happiest of all, and joined most
light- heartedly in private and public merriment. They provided the
lower hier- archy of the Church, the bureaucracy of the government, the
professions of physician, attorney, and pedagogue, the management of
industry and the guilds, the mathematical operations of foreign
commerce, the control of local trade. They were neither so harassed as
the rich to preserve a for- tune, nor so worried as the poor to feed and
clothe their young. Like the other classes they played cards, threw
dice, and deployed chessmen across the hours, but they rarely gambled
into ruin. They loved to play musical instruments, to sing and dance. As
their houses or apartments were small, they made promenades and patios
of the streets; these were almost free of horses and vehicles, since
transport preferred the canals. So it was not un- usual for the less
sedate classes, of an evening or on some festal day, to form impromptu
dances and choruses in the public squares. Every family had musical
instruments and included some bearable voice. And when Adrian Willaert
led the great double choir in St. Mark’s, the thousands who could get in
to hear reversed their famous boast, and became for a moment Chris-
tians first and Venetians afterward.</p>
<p>The festivals of Venice, in their unrivaled setting of churches,
palaces, and sea, were the most gorgeous in Europe. Every excuse was
used for pomp and pageantry: the inauguration of a doge, some religious
holyday or national holiday, the visit of a foreign dignitary, the
conclusion of a favorable peace, the Gharingello or Women’s Holiday, the
anniversary of St. Mark or the patron saint of a guild. In the
fourteenth century the joust was still the crowning event of a festival;
indeed, as late as 1491, when Ven- ice received with stately ceremony
the abdicated Queen of Cyprus, some troops from Crete held a joust on
the frozen Grand Canal. But the joust seemed inappropriate to a naval
power, and it was gradually replaced with some form of water festival,
usually a regatta. The greatest feast of all the year was the Sposalizio
del Mare, the solemn and colorful rite of marrying Venice — La
Serenissima, the most serene — to the Adriatic. When Beatrice d’Este
came to Venice in 1493 as the captivating emissary of Lodovico of Milan,
the Grand Canal was adorned throughout its length like some splen- did
avenue in Christmas time; the ship Bucentaur, symbolizing the Venetian
state and all decorated in purple and gold, sailed to meet her; a
thousand boats rowed or sailed around it, each adorned with garlands and
bunting; so many were the vessels, said an enthusiastic chronicler, that
for a mile around the water could not be seen.</p>
<p>In a letter written from Venice on this occasion Beatrice described
a</p>
<p>VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>momaria given in her honor in the Palace of the Doges. It was a
dramatic spectacle, mostly in pantomime, presented by masked actors
called momari , mummers. The Venetians were fond of divers such
performances. They retained till 1462 the medieval “mysteries”; but
popular demand caused these religious plays to be prefaced or
interrupted with comic interludes of so loose and disorderly a character
that they were forbidden in that year. Meanwhile the humanist movement
renewed Italian acquaintance with classic comedy; Plautus and Terence
were staged by the Compagnia della Scalza and other groups; and in 1 506
Fra Giovanni Armonio, monk, actor, and musician, presented in Latin, in
the convent of the Eremitani, Stepha- nium, the first modern comedy.
From these beginnings Venetian comedy progressed toward Goldoni, always
competing with the Harlequin and Pantaloon of the commedia dell’ arte ,
and at times so rivaling this in unin - hibited humor that Church and
state engaged in a running war with the Venetian stage.</p>
<p>An earthy licentiousness and profanity sat side by side, in the
Venetian or Italian character, with orthodox belief and hebdomadal
piety. The populace crowded St. Mark ’s on Sundays and holydays, and
drank homeo - pathic doses of the religion of terror and hope pictured
in the mosaics or sculptured in statue or relief; the deliberate
darkness of the pillared cavern intensified the effect of the icons and
sermons; and even the prostitutes, hiding for a time the yellow
handkerchief which the law required them to display as the badge of
their tribe, came here, after a weary night, to cleanse themselves with
prayer. The Venetian Senate favored this popular piety, and surrounded
the doge and the state with all the awe of religious ritual. It imported
at great cost, after the fall of Constantinople, the relics of East- ern
saints, and offered to pay ten thousand ducats for the seamless coat of
Christ.</p>
<p>And yet that same Senate, which Petrarch likened to an assembly of
the gods, 22 repeatedly flouted the authority of the Church, ignored the
most terrible papal decrees of excommunication and interdict, offered
asylum to prudent skeptics (till 1527), 23 sharply reproved a friar for
attacking the Jews (1512), and sought to make the Church in Venice an
appanage of the state. Bishops for Venetian sees were chosen by the
Senate, and were pre- sented to Rome for confirmation; such appointments
were in many cases put into effect despite papal refusal to confirm
them; after 1488 none but a Venetian could be appointed to a Venetian
episcopate; and no revenues could be collected or used by any
ecclesiastic, in the Venetian realm, who had not been approved by the
government. Churches and monasteries were</p>
<p>292 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>subject to state supervision, but no churchman could hold a public
office. 24 All legacies to monastic establishments paid a tax to the
state. Ecclesiastical courts were carefully watched to see to it that
guilty ecclesiastics should receive the same penalties as guilty laymen.
The Republic long resisted the introduction of the Inquisition; when it
yielded it made all verdicts of the Venetian inquisitors subject to
review and sanction by a senatorial com- mission; and only six sentences
of death were issued in all the history of the Inquisition in Venice. 25
The Republic proudly took the stand that in tem- poral matters it
“recognized no superior except the Divine Majesty.” 28 It openly
accepted the principle that a general council of the bishops of the
Church is above the pope, and that an appeal may be made from a pope to
a future council. When Sixtus IV laid an interdict on the city (1483)
the Council of Ten ordered all clergy to continue their services as
usual. When Julius II renewed the interdict as part of his war against
Venice, the Ten forbade the publication of the edict in Venetian
territory, and had their agents in Rome affix to the doors of
St. Peter’s an appeal from the Pope to a future council (1509). 27
Julius won that war, and forced Venice to ac- cept his spiritual
authority as absolute.</p>
<p>All in all, Venetian life was more attractive in its setting than in
its spirit. The government was competent, and showed high courage in
adversity; but it was sometimes brutal and always selfish; it never
thought of Venice as part of Italy, and seemed to care little what
tragedy might befall that divided land. It developed powerful
personalities — self-reliant, shrewd, ac- quisitive, valiant, proud; we
know a hundred of them in their portraits by artists whom they had just
enough refinement to patronize. It was a civil- ization that, compared
with the Florentine, lacked subtlety and depth; that, compared with the
Milanese under Lodovico, lacked finesse and grace. But it was the most
colorful, sumptuous, and sensually bewitching civilization that history
has ever known.</p>
<p>V. VENETIAN ART</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Architecture and Sculpture</li>
</ol>
<p>Sensuous color is the essence of Venetian art, even of its
architecture. Many Venetian churches and mansions, some business
buildings, had mo- saics or frescoes on their fronts. The fagade of
St. Mark’s gleamed with gilt and almost haphazard ornament; every decade
brought to it new spoils and forms, until the face of the great fane
became a bizarre medley of archi-</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 293</p>
<p>tecture, sculpture, and mosaic, in which decoration drowned
structure, and the parts forgot the whole. To admire that fagade with
something fonder than wonder one must take his stand 576 feet away, at
the farther end of the Piazza San Marco; in that perspective the
brilliant conglomeration of Romanesque portals, Gothic ogees, classical
columns, Renaissance railing, and Byzantine domes blends int o one
exotic phantasm, an Aladdin’s magic dream.</p>
<p>The Piazza was not then as ample and majestic as now. In the
fifteenth century it was still unpaved; part of it was occupied by vines
and trees, a stonecutter’s yard, and a latrine. In 1495 it was paved
with brick; in 1 500 Alessandro Leopardi cast for the three flagstaffs
such pedestals as no later ones would ever surpass; and in 1512
Bartolommeo Buon the Younger raised the majestic campanile. (It fell in
1902, but was rebuilt on the same design.) Not so pleasing are the
offices of the Procurators of St. Mark — the Procuratie Vecchie and
Nuove, built between 1517 and 1640, and hemming in the Piazza on north
and south with their immense and monoto- nous facades.</p>
<p>Between St. Mark’s and the Grand Ca nal stood the chief glory of
civic Venice, the Palace of the Doges. It underwent in this period so
many ren- ovations that little remained of its earlier form. Pietro
Baseggio rebuilt (1309-40) the southern wing facing the Canal; Giovanni
Buon and his son Bartolommeo Buon the Elder raised a new wing (1424-38)
on the western or Piazzetta front, and set up the Gothic Porta della
Carta (1438-43)* at the northwestern corner. These southern and western
fagades, with their graceful Gothic arcades and balconies, are among the
happiest products of the Renaissance. To the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries belong most of the sculptures on the fagades, and the superb
carvings of the column cap- itals; Ruskin thought one of these capitals
— beneath the figures of Adam and Eve — the finest in Europe. Within the
court Bartolommeo Buon the Younger and Antonio Rizzo built an ornate
arch, named after Francesco Foscari, and mingling three architectural
styles in unexpected harmony: Renaissance columns and lintels,
Romanesque arches, Gothic pinnacles. In the niches of the arch Rizzo
placed two strange statues: Adam protesting his innocence, and Eve
wondering at the penalties of knowledge. Rizzo planned, and Pietro
Lombardo completed, the eastern fagade of the court, a delightful
marriage of round and pointed arches with Renaissance cor- nices and
balconies. It was Rizzo again who designed the Scala de’ Giganti,</p>
<ul>
<li>Called “Door of the Paper” because on a bulletin board near it the
Signory posted its decrees.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>2 94</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>or Giants’ Stairs, from the court to the first floor— a simple,
stately structure named from the gigantic statues of Mars and Neptune
set up by Iacopo Sansovino at the head of the steps to symbolize
Venetian mastery of land and sea. In the interior were prison cells,
administrative offices, reception rooms, assembly halls for the Great
Council, the Senate, and the Ten. Many of these rooms were, or were soon
to be, decorated with the proudest murals in the history of art.</p>
<p>While the Republic glorified itself in this architectural gem, the
richer nobles . . . Giustiniani, Contarini, Gritti, Barbari, Loredani,
Foscari, Ven- dramini, Grimani . . . bounded the Grand Canal with their
palaces. We must picture these not in their present deterioration but in
their fifteenth- and sixteenth-century heyday: with their facades of
white marble, por- phyry, or serpentine; their Gothic windows and
Renaissance colonnades; their carved portals opening on the water; their
hidden courtyards adorned with statuary, fountains, gardens, frescoes,
urns; their interiors with tile or marble floors, mighty fireplaces,
inlaid furniture, Murano glass, silken can- opies, hangings of gold or
silver cloth, bronze chandeliers gilded, enameled, or chased, coffered
ceilings, and murals by men whose names have gone around the world. So,
for example, the Palazzo Foscari was decorated with paintings by Gian
Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Paris Bordone, Veronese. Perhaps these
rooms were more magnificent than comfortable, the chairs too
straight-backed, the windows drafty, and no mode of heating that could
warm both sides of a room or a man at the same time. Some Venetian
palaces cost 200,000 ducats; a law of 1476 tried to limit expenditure to
1 50 ducats per room, but we hear of rooms whose fixtures and
furnishings cost</p>
<ol start="2000" type="1">
<li>Probably the most ornate of the palaces was the Ca d’Oro, named the
House of Gold because the owner, Marino Contarini, ordered that almost
every inch of the marble fagade should be covered with decoration, much
of it in gilt. Its Gothic balconies and tracery still make it the
prettiest front on the Canal.</li>
</ol>
<p>These millionaires, while feathering their own nests, spared
something for the citadels of their incident al faith. Strange to say,
St. Mark’s was not till 1807 the cathedral of Venice; formally it was
the private chapel of the doge and the shrine of the city’s patron
saint; it belonged, so to speak, to the religion of the state. The
episcopal see was attached to the minor church of San Pietro di
Castello, in the northeastern corner of the city. In the same remote
section the Dominican friars had their seat, in the church of San
Giovanni e Paolo; there Gentile and Giovanni Bellini found their final
rest. More important to history is the church of the Franciscans — Santa
Maria</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 295</p>
<p>Gloriosa dei Frari (1330-1443), known in fond abbreviations as I
Frari, the Friars. Externally it made no show, but its interior gathered
fame through the years as the tomb of celebrated Venetians — Francesco
Foscari, Titian, Canova — and as a gallery of art. Here Antonio Rizzo
designed a noble mon- ument for the Doge Niccolo Tron; Gian Bellini set
up his Frari Madonna, and Titian his Madonna of the Pesaro Family; here,
above all, Titian’s As - sumption of the Virgin rises in majesty behind
the altar. Lesser master- pieces adorned lesser fanes: San Zaccaria
offered its congregation inspir- ing Madonnas by Giovanni Bellini and
Palma Vecchio; Santa Maria dell’ Orto had Tintoretto’s Presentation of
the Virgin, and his bones; San Se - bastiano received Veronese’s remains
and some of his finest paintings; and for San Salvatore Titian painted
an Annunciation in his ninety-first year.</p>
<p>In the construction and decoration of the churches and palaces of
Venice a remarkable family of architects and sculptors played a
persistent part. The Lombardi came to Venice from northwestern Italy,
and so earned their cognomen, but their real name was Solari. They
included the Cristo- foro Solari who carved the effigies of Lodovico and
Beatrice, and his brother Andrea, a painter; both men worked in Venice
as well as Milan. Pietro Lombardo left his mark upon a score of
buildings in Venice. He and his sons Antonio and Tullio designed the
churches of San Giobbe and Santa Maria de’ Miracoli— hardly to our
current taste; the tombs of Pietro Mo- cenigo and Niccolo Marcello in
Santi Giovanni e Paolo, of Bishop Zanetti in Treviso Cathedral, and of
Dante in Ravenna; and the Palazzo Vendra- min-Calergi, in which Wagner
died; and in most of these enterprises they supplied the sculpture as
well as the architectural plans. Pietro himself did much architectural
and sculptural work in the Palace of the Doges. Tullio and Antonio,
aided by Alessandro Leopardi, set up the tomb of Andrea Vendramin in
Santi Giovanni e Paolo — the greatest work of sculpture in Venice
excepting only the Colleoni of Verrocchio and Leopardi in the square
before that church. For the adjoining Scuola di San Marco, or Fraternity
of St. Mark, Pietro Lombardo designed a rich portal and a strange
fa9ade. Finally a Sante Lombardo shared in building the Scuola di San
Rocco, famous for its fifty-six paintings by Tintoretto. Largely</p>
<p>through the work of this family the Renaissance style of columns,
archi- traves, and decorated pediments prevailed over Gothic ogives and
pin- nacles, and Byzantine domes. In Venice, however, Renaissance archi-
tecture, still unsteady under Oriental influence, was too ornate, and
obscured its lines with ornament. The atmosphere and classic
traditions</p>
<p>296 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>of Rome were needed to give the new style its definitive and
harmonious form.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Bellini</li>
</ol>
<p>Next to St. Mark’s and the Ducal Pa lace, the glory of V enetian art
was in painting. Many forces conspired to make the painters the
favorites of Venetian patronage. The Church, here as elsewhere, had to
tell the Chris- tian story to its people, of whom only a few could read;
she needed pictures and statuary to continue the passing effect of
speech; so each generation, and many churches and monasteries, had to
have Annunciations, Nativities, Adorations, Visitations, Presentations,
Massacres of the Innocents, Flights into Egypt, Transfigurations, Last
Suppers, Crucifixions, Entombments, Resurrections, Ascensions,
Assumptions, Martyrdoms. When detachable paintings faded, or grew stale
to a congregation, they might be sold to col- lectors or museums; they
were periodically cleaned and occasionally re- painted or retouched;
their authors, if reincarnated, might not recognize them today. This, of
course, did not apply to murals, which usually dis- integrated on their
walls. Sometimes, to avoid this fatality, the picture was painted upon
canvas and this was then fixed to the wall, as in the Hall of the Great
Council. In Venice the state rivaled the Church in appetite for</p>
<p>murals, for these could feed patriotism and pride by celebrating the
gran- deur and ceremonies of the government, the triumphs of trade or
war. The scuole , too, might order murals and painted banners to
commemorate their patron saints or their annual pageantry. Rich men
wanted scenes of out- door beauty or indoor love pictured on the walls
of their palaces; and they sat for portraits to cheat for a while the
ironic brevity of fame. The Si- gnory ordered a portrait of every doge
in turn; even the Procurators of St. Mark so preserved their features
for a careless posterity. It was in Venice that the portrait and the
easel picture achieved most popularity.</p>
<p>Until the middle of the fifteenth century painting developed slowly
in Venice; then, like some flower catching the morning sun, it burst
into un- paralleled radiance as Venetians found in it a vehicle of the
color and life that they had learned to love. Perhaps some of that V
enetian flair for color had come to the lagoons from the East, with
merchants who imported Ori- ental ideas and tastes as well as goods, who
brought back with them mem- ories of gleaming tiles and gilded domes,
and displayed in Venetian markets, churches, or homes Oriental silks,
satins, velvets, brocades, and cloth of silver or gold. Indeed Venice
never quite made up its mind whether it was CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER
REALM 297</p>
<p>an Occidental or an Oriental state. On the Rialto East and West did
meet; Othello and Desdemona could become man and wife. And if Venice and
her painters could not learn color from the East, they could get it from
the Venetian sky, observing its infinite variety of light and mist, and
the splen- dor of sunsets touching campaniles and palaces, or mirrored
in the sea. Meanwhile the victories of Venetian arms and fleets, and the
heroic re- covery from threatened ruin, roused the pride and imagination
of patrons and painters, and commemorated themselves in art. Wealth
discovered that it was meaningless unless it could transform itself into
goodness, beauty, or truth.</p>
<p>An external stimulus was added to generate a Venetian school of
paint- ing. In 1409 Gentile da Fabriano was brought to Venice to
decorate the Hall of the Great Council, and Antonio Pisano, called
Pisanello, came from Verona to collaborate. We cannot say how well they
performed, but it is probable that they stirred the Venetian painters to
replace with softer con- tours and richer colors the dark and rigid
hieratic forms of the Byzantine tradition, and the pale and lifeless
forms of the Giottesque school. Perhaps some minor influence came down
over the Alps with Giovanni d’Ala - magna (d. 1450); but Giovanni seems
to have grown up, and learned his art, in Murano and Venice. With his
brother-in-law Antonio Vivarini he painted for the church of San
Zaccaria an altarpiece whose figures begin to have the grace and
tenderness that would make the work of the Bellini a revelation to
Venice.</p>
<p>The greatest influence of all came from Sicily, or Flanders.
Antonello da Messina grew up as a businessman, and presumably had no
thought, in his youth, that his name would be carried down for centuries
in the history of art. While in Naples he saw (if we accept Vasari’s
perhaps romantic account) an oil painting that had been sent to King
Alfonso by some Flor- entine merchants in Bruges. From Cimabue ( c .
1240-c. 1302) to Antonello (1430-79) Italian painting on wood or canvas
had relied on tempera — mix- ing the colors with a gelatinous substance.
Such colors left a rough surface, were maladapted to blending for
delicate shades and gradations, and tended to crack and slake off even
before the art ist’s death. Antonello saw the ad - vantages of mixing
pigments with oil: readier blending, easier handling and cleaning,
brighter finish, greater permanence. He went to Bruges, and there
studied the oil technique of the Flemish painters, then basking in the
heyday of Burgundy. Having occasion to go to Venice, he became so
enamored of the city — being himself “greatly addicted to women and
pleas - ure” 28 — that he spent there the remainder of his life. He
abandoned busi-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>ness, and gave all his industry to painting. For the church of San
Cassiano he painted in oil an altarpiece that became a model for a
hundred similar pictures: the Madonna enthroned between four saints,
with musician angels at her feet, and full Venetian colors on the
brocades and satins of the drapery. Antonello shared his knowledge of
the new method with other artists, and the great age of Venetian
painting began. Many nobles sat to him for their portraits, and several
of these pictures survive: the crude, strong Poet at Pavia, the
Condottiere in the Louvre, the Portrait of a Man, plump and quizzical,
in the Johnson Collection in Philadelphia, the Portrait of a Young Man
in New York, and the Self-Portrait in London. At the height of his
success Antonello fell sick, developed pleurisy, and died at the age of
forty-nine. The artists of Venice gave him a sumptuous funeral, and
acknowledged their debt in a generous epitaph:</p>
<p>In this ground is buried Antoninus the painter, the highest orna-</p>
<p>ment of Messina and all Sicily; celebrated not only for his
pictures,</p>
<p>which were distinguished by singular skill and beauty, but
because,</p>
<p>with high zeal and tireless technique, through mixing colors with
oil, he first brought splendor and permanence to Italian painting.
29</p>
<p>Among the pupils of Gentile da Fabriano at Venice was Iacopo Bellini,
founder of a brief but major dynasty in Renaissance art. After this
tutelage Iacopo painted in Verona, Ferrara, and Padua. There his
daughter married Andrea Mantegna; and through him, as well as more
directly, Iacopo came under Squarcione’s influence. When he returned to
Venice he brought with him, if we may mingle metaphors, a rubbing of the
Paduan technique, and an echo of the Florentine. All this, and the
Venetian heritage, and, later, Antonello’s tricks with oil, passed down
to Iacopo’s sons, the rival geniuses Gentile and Giovanni Bellini.</p>
<p>Gentile was twenty-three when the family moved to Padua (1452). He
felt intimately the influence of his brother-in-law Mantegna; when he
painted the shutters for the organ in the Padua cathedral he followed
too carefully the hard figures and bold foreshortenings of the Eremitani
fres- coes. But in Venice a new gentleness appeared in his portrait of
San Lorenzo Giustiniani. In 1474 the Signory assigned to him and his
half- brother Giovanni the task of painting or repainting fourteen
panels in the Hall of the Great Council. These canvases were among the
earliest Ve- netian pictures painted in oil. 30 They were destroyed by
fire in 1577, but the sketches that remain show that Gentile used for
the pictures his char- acteristic narrative style, in which some major
incident is portrayed at the</p>
<p>VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>center, and a dozen episodes play at the side. Vasari saw the
paintings, and marveled at their realism, variety, and complexity.
31</p>
<p>When Sultan Mohammed II sent a request to the Signory for a good
portrait painter, Gentile was chosen. In Constantinople (1474) he en-
liven ed the Sultan’s chambers and spirits with erotic pictures, and
made of him a portrait (London) and a medallion (Boston), both showing a
power- ful character drawn by an expert hand. Mohammed died in 1481; his
suc- cessor, more orthodox, obeyed the Moslem ban on the painting of
human figures, and scattered into oblivion all but those two of the
works done by Gentile in the Turkish capital. Luckily Gentile had
returned to Venice in 1480, heavy with gifts and decorations from the
old Sultan. He rejoined Giovanni in the Ducal Palace, and completed his
contract with the Signory. It rewarded him with a pension of two hundred
ducats a year.</p>
<p>In his old age he painted his greatest pictures. The guild of
St. John the Evangelist had what it believed to be a miracle-working
relic of the True Cross. It solicited Gentile to describe in three
paintings the healing of an invalid by the relic, a Corpus Christi
procession carrying it, and the miracu- lous finding of the lost
fragment. The first panel has yielded its splendor to time. The second,
painted when Gentile was seventy, is a brilliant pano- rama of
dignitaries, choristers, and candle bearers parading around the Piazza
San Marco, with St. Mark’s in the background, appearing very much as it
is today. In the third picture, painted at seventy-four, the relic has
fallen into the San Lorenzo Canal; the people crowding the bywalks and
bridges are panic-stricken, and many kneel in prayer; but Andrea Vendra-
min plunges into the water, recovers the relic, and then, buoyed up by
it, moves with uninfected dignity toward the shore. Every figure in
these crowded canvases is drawn with realistic fidelity. And again the
artist delights in surrounding the main event with engaging episodes: a
boat slip- ping away from its dock while the gondolier watches the
recovery of the relic; and a nude black Moor poised to dive into the
stream.</p>
<p>Gentile’s last great picture (Brera) was painted at the age of
seventy -six for his own confraternity of St. Mark, and showed the
Apostle preaching in Alexandria. As usual it is a crowd; Gentile
preferred to take humanity wholesale. He died at seventy-eight (1507),
leaving the picture to be fin- ished by his brother Gian.</p>
<p>Giovanni Bellini (Gian Bellini, Giambellino) was only two years</p>
<p>younger than Gentile, but outlived him by nine. In this span of
eighty- six years he ranged the whole gamut of his art, tried and
mastered a rich variety of genres, and brought Venetian painting to its
first peak. At Padua</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>he absorbed Mantegna’s technical teaching without imitating his hard
and statuesque style; and in Venice he adopted with unprecedented
success the new method of mixing pigments with oil. He was the first
Venetian to reveal the glory of color; and at the same time he attained
to a grace and accuracy of line, a delicacy of feeling, a depth of
interpretation, that, even in the lifetime of his brother, made him the
greatest and most sought-for painter in Venice.</p>
<p>Churches and guilds and private patrons seemed never to tire of his
Ma- donnas; he bequeathed the Virgin in a hundred forms to a dozen
lands. The Venetian Academy alone has a host of them: Madonna with the
Sleeping Child, Madonna with Two Holy Women, Madonna con Bambino, Ma-
donna degli Alberetti, Madonna with St. Faul and St. George, Madonna
Enthroned . . . and, best of this group, the Madonna of St. Job; this,
we are told, is the first picture that Giovanni painted in oils, and it
is one of the most brilliantly colored works in Venice — which is to say
in the world. The little Museo Correr at the western end of the Piazza
San Marco has another Giambellino Madonna, tender and sad and lovely;
San Zaccaria has a variation on the Madonna of St. Job; the church of
the Frari has a Ma- donna Enthroned, a little stiff and severe and
hemmed in by gloomy saints, but appealing in her rich blue robes. The
zealous wanderer will find many more of Gian’s Virgins, in Verona,
Bergamo, Milan, Rome, Paris, London, New York, Washington. What more, in
color, could be said of Our Lady after this polygraphic devotion?
Perugino and Raphael would rival this multiplicity, and Titian, in that
same church of the Frari, would find some- thing more to say.</p>
<p>Giovanni did not do so well with the Son. Christ Blessing, in the
Louvre, is middling, but the Sacred Conversation near it is movingly
beautiful. The famous Pieta in the Brera at Milan has been warmly
praised , 32 but it shows a duet of charmless faces holding up a dead
Christ who seems to need noth- ing more, for perfect physical condition,
than to be freed from too much attention; this harsh and crude burial
picture — undated — belongs to Bellini’s Mantegnesque youth. How much
more pleasing is the Santa Justina in a private collection in Milan! —
again somewhat stylized and posed, but with a delicacy of features, a
modest drooping of the eyelids, a splendor of cos- tume, that make this
one of Gian’s most successful efforts. It was appar - ently a portrait,
and Gian was now so skilled in rendering a living face and soul that a
hundred patrons begged to share his immortality. Look again at Doge
Loredano; with what depth of understanding, and keenness of eye, and
dexterity of hand Bellini has caught the unfaltering, serene power
of</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) VENICE AND HER REALM 301</p>
<p>the man who could lead his people to victory in a war for survival
against the united assault of nearly all the great states of Italy and
transalpine Eu- rope! — And then, rivaling the Leonardo who was creeping
up on him in skill and fame, Giovanni tried his palette at bizarre
landscapes like that medley of rocks, mountains, castles, sheep, water,
riven tree, and clouded sky which St. Francis (in the Frick Collection)
calmly confronts as he re- ceives the stigmata.</p>
<p>In his old age the master tired of repeating the usual sacred themes,
and experimented with allegory and classic mythology. He turned Knowl-
edge, Happiness, Truth, Slander, Purgatory, the Church herself, into
per- sons or stories, and sought to bring them to life with alluring
landscapes. Two of his pagan pictures hang in the Washington National
Gallery:</p>
<p>Orpheus Charming the Beasts, and The Feast of the Gods — a picnic of
bare- breasted women and half-naked, half-drunken men. The picture is
dated 1514; it was painted for Duke Alfonso of Ferrara when the artist
was eighty- four years old. We are reminded again of Alfieri’s boast—
that the man-plant grows more vigorously in Italy than elsewhere on the
earth.</p>
<p>Giovanni lived only a year after signing that testament of youth. His
was a full and reasonably happy life: an astonishing procession of
master- pieces, a kaleidoscope of warm colors on soft robes, an immense
advance in grace, composition, and vitality upon the Giotteschi and the
Byzantophiles, a power of perception and individualization unseen in the
arid figures and indiscriminate masses of Gentile’s pictures, a fruitful
mediation, in time and style, between a Mantegna who knew only Romans
and a Titian who felt and pictured every phase of life from Flora to
Charles V. One of Gian’s pupils was Giorgione, who developed his
master’s idyls of wood and stream; Titian worked with Giorgione, and
received the great tradition. Genera- tion by generation Venetian art
was accumulating its knowledge, varying its experiments, and preparing
its culmination.</p>
<p>3 . From the Bellini to Giorgione</p>
<p>The success of the Bellini made painting popular in Venice, where mo-
saics had held so long a sway. Studios multiplied, patrons opened their
purses, and artists developed who, though they were not Bellini or</p>
<p>Giorgiones, would have been the brightest stars in lesser galaxies.
Vincenzo Catena painted so well that many of his pictures were credited
to Gian Bellini or to Giorgione. Antonio Vivarini’s younge r brother,
Bartolommeo, met a conservative demand by applying to medieval themes
the technique</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>of Squarcione and the fuller colors that painting had learned to mix
and convey. Bartolommeo’s nephew and pupil, Alv ise Vivarini, threatened
for a time to rival Gian Bellini with pretty Madonnas, and achieved a
monu- mental altarpiece — Madonna with Six Saints — which passed from
Italy to the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum in Berlin. Alvise was a good
teacher, for three of his pupils found moderate fame. Bartolommeo
Montagna we leave to Vicenza. Giovanni Battista Cima da Conegliano
worked for the Ma- donna market; one at Parma has a handsome figure of
the Archangel Michael, while another in Cleveland redeems itself with
brilliant color. Marco Basaiti painted a fine Calling of the Sons of
Zebedee (Venice), and a delightful portrait — A Youth — in the London
National Gallery.</p>
<p>Carlo Crivelli may also have been a pupil of the Vivarini; however,
he had to abscond from Venice soon after his seventeenth year ( 1457) :
having abducted the wife of a sailor, he was fined and jailed; released,
he sought safety in Padua, where he studied in Squarcione’s school. In
1468 he moved to Ascoli, and spent his remaining twenty-five years
painting pictures for the churches there and thereabouts. Perhaps
because he left Venice so soon, Crivelli hardly shared in the
progressive movement of Venetian painting; he preferred tempera to oil,
kept to the traditional religious subjects, and adopted an almost
Byzantine scheme of subordinating representation to decoration. He gave
his pictures an enamel finish, which went well with the gilded frames of
the polyptychs he filled; and though his Madonnas seem cold, there is a
delicate grace in their drawing that presages Gior- gione.</p>
<p>Vettor (Vittore) Carpaccio was a major among these minors. Starting
with studies in perspective and design in the manner of Mantegna, he
adopted the narrative style of Gentile Bellini, added to it a youthful
pref- erence for imaginary idyls rather than contemporary events, and
applied to his romantic themes a fully developed technique. Quite alien
to his usually blithe spirit is an early picture (in New York),
Meditation on the Passion — a macabre study of Sts. Jerome and Onofrius
imagining Christ seated before them dead, with skull and crossbones at
their feet, and a back- ground of lowering clouds. When he was
thirty-three (1488) Carpaccio received an important commission: to paint
for the School of St. Ursula a series of pictures illustrating her
history. In nine picturesque panels he told how the handsome Prince
Conon of England had come to Brittany to wed Ursula, daughter of its
king; how she begged him to postpone the wedding until, with a train of
1 1,000 virgins, she could make a pilgrimage to Rome;</p>
<p>VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>how Conon accompanied her lovingly, and all received the papal
blessing; how, then, an angel appeared to Ursula and announced that she
and her virgins must go to Cologne and be martyred; how she leaves the
sorrowing Conon and, with her train, goes in calm dignity to Cologne;
how its pagan kinglet proposes marriage to her, and, when she refuses,
slays all 11,001. The legend suited Carpaccio’s fancy; he deli ghted in
picturing the crowds of maidens and courtiers, and made nearly every one
of them aristocratic and fair and colorfully dressed; and to the various
scenes he brought not only his pictorial science but his knowledge of
actual things — the forms of architecture, the shipping in a bay, the
patient procession of the clouds.</p>
<p>In an interval of his nine years’ labor with Ursula, Carpaccio
painted for the School of St. John the Evangelist The Healing of the
Demoniac by a relic of the Holy Cross. Daring comparison with Gentile
Bellini, Vittore described a scene on a Venetian canal, crowded with
people, gondolas, and palaces. Here was all of Gentile’s realism and
detail, done with a brilliant finish beyond the older man’s reach.
Stirred by Carpaccio’s success, the School of St. George of the
Slavonians asked him to commemorate their patron saint on the walls of
their Venetian oratory. Again he took nine years, and painted nine
scenes. They do not quite equal the Ursula series, but Carpaccio, now in
his fifties, had not lost his flair for representing graceful figures in
harmonious combinations, and architectural backgrounds fanciful in
conception but convincing in presentation. St. George attacks the dragon
in an impetuous charge; in contrast St. Jerome is shown as the quiet
scholar immersed in study in a surprisingly handsome room, with no other
company than his lion. Every feature in the room is pictured with minute
fidelity, even to the musical score so legible on a fallen scroll that
Molmenti transcribed it for the piano.</p>
<p>In 1 508 Carpaccio and two obscure artists were appointed to set a
value on a strange mural painted by a rising young artist on an outer
wall of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi — the warehouse of the Teuton merchants
near the Rialto bridge. He judged it worth a fee of 1 50 ducats (875?).
Though Carpaccio still had eighteen years of life in him, he painted
only one more great picture — a Presentation in the Temple (1510) for
the chapel of the</p>
<p>304</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>4 . Giorgione</p>
<p>It might seem strange that artists should be hired at high fees to
paint a warehouse wall. But in 1507 the Venetians felt that life without
color was dead; and the German traders there, some from the great
Diirer’s Nurem - berg, had their own lusty sense of art. So they
sublimated part of their profits into two murals, and had the luck to
choose immortals for the task. The paintings soon succumbed to salt
moisture and the sun, and only vague blotches remain, but even these
attest the early fame of Giorgione da Castelfranco. He was then
twenty-nine years old. We do not know his name; an old story made him
the love child of an aristocratic Barbarelli and a woman of the people;
but this may be an afterthought. 38 In his thirteenth or fourteenth year
( c . 1490) he was sent from Castelfranco to Venice to serve as
apprentice to Gian Bellini. He developed rapidly, won substantial
commissions, bought a house, painted a fresco on its front, and filled
his home with music and revelry; for he played the lute well, and
preferred gay women in the flesh to the loveliest of them on canvas.
What influences formed his wistful style it is hard to say, for he was
unlike the other painters of his day, except that he may have learned
from Carpaccio some grace and charm. Probably the decisive influence
came from letters rather than from art. When Giorgione was twenty-seven
or twenty-eight Italian literature was taking a bucolic turn; Sannazaro
published his Arcadia in 1504; per- haps Giorgione read these poems and
found in their pleasant fancies some suggestions of idealized landscapes
and amours. From Leonardo — passing through Venice in 1500 — Giorgione
may have acquired a taste for a mystic, dreamy softness of expression, a
delicacy of nuance, a refinement of manner that made him, for a
tragically brief moment, the summit of Venetian art.</p>
<p>Among the earliest works attributed to him — for in hardly any case
can we be sure of his authorship — are two wood panels describing the
exposure and rescue of the infant Paris; the story is an excuse for
painting shepherds and rural landscapes breathing peace. In the first
picture that is by common consent his — The Gypsy and the Soldier — we
get a typically Giorgionesque fancy: a casual woman, naked except for a
shawl around her shoulders, sits on her discarded dress on the mossy
bank of a rushing stream, nurses a child, and looks anxiously about her;
behind her stretches a landscape of Roman arches, a river and a bridge,
towers and a temple, curious trees, white lightning, and green
storm-laden clouds; near her is a comely youth holding a shepherd’s
staff— but richly garbed for a shepherd! — and so pleased with the scene
that he ignores the gathering storm. The story is uncertain;</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) VENICE AND HER REALM 305</p>
<p>what the picture means is that Giorgione liked handsome youths,
soft-con- toured women, and nature even in its moods of wrath.</p>
<p>In 1 504 he painted, for a bereaved family in the town of his birth,
the Madonna of Castelfranco. It is absurd and beautiful. In the
forefront St. Liberale, in the shining armor of a medieval knight, holds
a lance for the Virgin, and St. Francis preaches to the air; high aloft
on a double pedestal Mary sits with her babe, who leans recklessly out
from his high perch. But the green and violet brocade at Mary’s feet is
a wonder of color and design; Mary’s robes fall about her in w rinkles
as lovely as wrinkles can ever be; her face has the gentle tenderness
that poets picture in the mates of their dreams; and the landscape
recedes with Leonardesque mystery till the sky melts into the sea.</p>
<p>When Giorgione and his friend Tiziano Vecelli received the assignment
to paint the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, Giorgione chose the wall fronting the
Grand Canal, and Titian took the Rialto side. Vasari, examining Gior-
gione’s fresco half a century later, found it impossible to make head or
tail of what another spectator described as “trophies, nude bodies,
heads in chiaroscuro . . . geometricians measuring the terrestrial
globe, perspectives of columns, and between them men on horseback, and
other fantasies.” However, the same writer adds: “It may be seen how
accomplished Gior- gione was in handling colors in fresco.” 34</p>
<p>But his genius lay in conception rather than coloring. When he
painted the Sleeping Venus that was a priceless treasure of the Dresden
Gallery, he might have thought of her in purely sensual terms as an
inviting forma- tion of molecules. Doubtless she is that, too, and marks
the passage of Venetian art from Christian to pagan themes and
sentiment. But there is nothing immodest or suggestive about this Venus.
She lies asleep, precari- ously nude in the open air, on a red cushion
and a white silken robe, her right arm under her head, her left hand
serving as a fig leaf, one perfect limb outstretched over another raised
beneath it; seldom has art so simulated the velvet texture of feminine
surfaces, or so conveyed the grace of a natural pose. But on her face is
a look of such innocence and peace as rarely accord with naked beauty.
Giogione here has put himself beyond good and evil, and lets the
esthetic sense transiently dominate desire. In another piece — the Fete
champetre or Pastoral Symphony of the Louvre — the pleasure is frankly
sexual, and yet again has all the innocence of nature. Two nude women
and two clothed men are enjoying a holiday in the countryside: a
patrician youth, in a doublet of gleaming red silk, strumming a lute;
beside him a disheveled shepherd painfully trying to bridge the gap
between a sim-</p>

<p>306</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>pie and a cultivated mind; the aristocrat’s lady, in a grac eful
motion, empty- ing a crystal pitcher into a well; the shepherd’s lass
waiting patiently for</p>
<p>Finally, in The Concert of the Pitti Palace, desire seems forgotten
as</p>
<p>irrelevantly primitive, and music is all, or becomes a bond of
friendship subtler than desire. Until the nineteenth century this “most
Giorgio - nesque” of all pictures 35 was regularly accredited to
Giorgione; many critics now ascribe it to Titian; since the matter is
still doubtful let us leave the authorship to Giorgione, because he
loved music only next to woman, and because Titian is rich enough in
masterpieces to spare one to his friend. At the left a plumed youth
stands, a bit lifeless and negative; a monk sits at a clavichord, his
beautifully rendered hands on the keys, his face turned round to a bald
cleric on our right; the cleric lays one hand on the monk’s shoulder,
and holds in the other a cello resting on the floor. Has the music
ended, or not yet begun? It does not matter; what moves us is the silent
depth of feeling in the countenance of the monk, whose every fiber has
been refined, and his every sentiment ennobled, by music; who hears it
long after all the instruments have been mute. That face, not idealized
but pro- foundly realized, is one of the miracles of Renaissance
painting.</p>
<p>Giorgione lived a short life, and apparently a merry one. He seems to
have had many women, and to have healed each broken romance with a new
one soon begun. Vasari reports that Giorgione caught the plague from his
latest love; all that we know is that he died in the epidemic of 1 5 1 1
at the age of thirty- four. His influence was already extensive. A dozen
“Gior - gionesque” minor artists painted rural idyls, conversation
pieces, musical interludes, masque costumes, in vain efforts to capture
the refinement and finish of his style, the airy overtones of his
landscapes, the guileless eroti- cism of his themes. He left two pupils
who were to make a stir in the world: Sebastiano del Piombo, who went
off to Rome, and Tiziano Vecelli, the greatest Venetian of all.</p>
<p>5 . Titian: The Formative Years: 7477-/555</p>
<p>He was bom in the town of Pieve, in the Cadoric range of the
Dolomites, and those rugged mountains were well remembered in his
landscapes. When he was nine or ten he was brought to Venice, and was
apprenticed successively to Sebastiano Zuccato, Gentile Bellini, and
Giovanni Bellini.</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) VENICE AND HER REALM 307</p>
<p>In Giovanni’s studio he worked side by side with Giorgione, who was
his senior by only a year. When that Keats of the brush set up his own
studio Titian probably went with him as assistant or associate. He was
so deeply influenced by Giorgione that some of his early pictures have
been ascribed to Giorgione, and some of Giorgione’s later pictures to
Titian; the inimita - ble Concert probably belongs to this period.
Together they painted the Fondaco walls.</p>
<p>From the plague that took Giorgione’s life— or from the moratorium
laid upon Venetian art by the war of the League of Cambrai — Titian fled
to Padua ( 1 5 1 1 ) . There he painted three frescoes for the Scuola
del Santo, recording miracles of St. Anthony; if we may judge from their
crudity, Titian at thirty-five had far to go before equaling the best
work of Gior- gione; Goethe, however, with penetrating hindsight, saw in
them “the prom ise of great things.” 36 Returning to Venice, Titian
addressed to the doge and the Council of Ten (May 31, 1513) a letter
that recalls Leonar- do’s appeal to Lodovico a generation before:</p>
<p>Illustrious Prince! High and mighty lords! I, Titian of Cadore,</p>
<p>have from childhood upwards studied the art of painting, desirous of
a little fame rather than of profit. . . . And although in the past,
and</p>
<p>also in the present, I have been urgently invited by His Holiness
the</p>
<p>Pope and other lords to enter their service, I, as the faithful
subject</p>
<p>of your Excellencies, have rather cherished the wish to leave behind
me a memorial in this famous city. Therefore, if it seem good to</p>
<p>your Excellencies, I am anxious to paint in the Hall of the Great</p>
<p>Council, employing therein all my powers; and to begin with a
can-</p>
<p>vas of the battle on the side of the Piazzetta, which is so
difficult</p>
<p>that no one has yet had the courage to attempt it. I should be
willing to accept for my labor any reward that may be thought proper,
or</p>
<p>even less. Therefore, being, as aforesaid, studious only of honor and
to please your Excellencies, I beg to ask for the first broker’s
patent,</p>
<p>tive of all promised reversions of such patent, and on the same con-
ditions and with the same charges and exemptions as Messer Zuan</p>
<p>Belin 〔Gian Bellini〕, besides two assistants to be paid by the
Salt</p>
<p>Office, as well as all colors and necessaries. … In return for
which</p>
<p>I promise to do the work above named with such speed and excel-</p>
<p>lence as will satisfy the Signori . 87</p>
<p>A “broker’s patent” ( senseria ) was formally an appointment as trade
in - termediary between Venetian and foreign merchants; actually, in the
case of the broker’s pa tent with the German merchants in Venice, it
made the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>holder the official painter of the state, and paid him 300 crowns
(750) a year for painting a portrait of the doge and such other pictures
as the gov- ernm ent might require. Apparently Titian’s proposal was
tentatively ac - cepted by the Council; in any case he began to paint
The Battle of Cadore in the Ducal Palace. But his rivals persuaded the
Council to withhold the patent from him, and to suspend the pay of his
assistants (1514). After negotiations that irritated all concerned, he
received the post and pay of the patent without the title (1516). He in
his turn procrastinated, and did not complete till 1537 the two canvases
that he had begun in the Sala del Mag- gior Consiglio. They were
destroyed by fire in 1 577.</p>
<p>Titian developed leisurely, like any organism dowered with a century
of life. But as early as 1 508 he showed the spiritual penetration and
techni- cal power that were to put him above all his rivals in
portraiture. A name- less portrait once named Ariosto has in it a memory
of Giorgione’s style— a poetic face, and subtle eyes a little malicious,
and sumptuous raiment that set a model for a thousand later works. And
in this period (1506-16) the maturing artist already knew how to paint
women of ample loveliness, stemming from Giorgione and expanding toward
Rubens. The movement from the Virgin to Venus continued in Titian, even
while he painted reli- gious pictures of great spendor and renown. The
same hand that stirred piety with a Gypsy Madonna and an Adoration of
the Shepherds could turn to a Woman at Her Toilet, and that incarnation
of voluptuous inno- cence, the Flora of the Uffizi Gallery. This gentle
face and generous bosom probably served again in The Daughter of
Herodias; Salome is as thor- oughly Venetian as the severed head is
powerfully Hebraic.</p>
<p>In or near the year 1515 Titian produced two of his most celebrated
pic- tures. The Three Ages of Man shows a group of naked infants
sleeping be- neath a tree; a Cupid so soon inoculating them with the mad
pursuit; a bearded octogenarian contemplating a skull; and a young
couple happy in the spring of love, yet looking at each other wistfully,
as if foreseeing the erosive pertinacity of time. Sacred and Profane
Love has a modern title that would surprise a resurrected Titian. When
first mentioned (1615), the picture was called Beauty Adorned and
Unadorned ; 38 probably it aimed not to point a moral but to adorn a
tale. The “profane” nude is the most perfect figure in Titian’s
repertoire, the very V enus de Milo of the Renais - sance. But the
“sacred” lady is secular too; her jeweled girdle draws the eye, her
silken gown tempts the touch; probably she is the same buxom courtesan
who posed for Flora and the Woman at Her Toilet. If the spec- tator
looks long enough he will see a complex landscape behind the
figures:</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) VENICE AND HER REALM 309</p>
<p>plants and flowers and a thick clump of trees, a shepherd tending his
flock, two lovers, hunters and dogs chasing a hare, a town and its
towers, a church and its campanile, a green Giorgionesque sea, a clouded
sky. What differ- ence does it make that we cannot knowjust what the
picture “means”? It is beauty made to “stay awhile”; and is that not
what Faust thought worth a soul?</p>
<p>Having learned that female beauty, adorned or natural, would always
find customers, Titian pursued the theme joyously. Early in 1516 he ac-
cepted the invitation of Alfonso I to paint some panels in the Castello
at Ferrara. The artist was lodged there, with two assistants, for some
five weeks, and presumably came frequently thereafter from Venice. For
the Alabaster Hall Titian painted three pictures that continued
Giorgione’s pagan mood. In The Bacchanal men and women, some of them
naked, drink, dance, and make love before a landscape of brown trees,
blue lake, and silver clouds; a scroll on the ground bears a French
motto: “He who drinks and does not drink again does not know what d
rinking is.” In the distance an old Noah sprawls naked and drunk; closer
a lad and lass join in dance, their garments whirling in the breeze; in
the foreground a woman whose firm breasts display her youth lies nude
and sleeping on the grass; and near her an anxious child raises his
dress to ease his bladder and bring the Bacchic cycle to completion. In
Bacchus and Ariadne the abandoned woman is startled by a Bacchic
procession bursting through the woods — drunken satyrs, a naked male
entwined with snakes, the nude god of wine leaping from his chariot to
capture the fleeing princess. In these pictures, and The Worship of
Venus, the Pagan Renaissance is in full command.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Titian painted an arresting portrait of his new patron, the
Duke Alfonso: a handsome intelligent face, a corpulent body dignified
with robes of state, a beautiful hand (hardly that of a potter and
gunner) resting on a beloved cannon; this is the picture that stirred
even Michelangelo to praise. Ariosto sat for a portrait, and returned
the compliment with a line in a later edition of the Furioso. Lucrezia
Borgia too sat for the great por- traitist, but no trace of that
painting remains; and Laura Dianti, Alfonso’s mistress, may have posed
for a picture that survives only in a copy in Modena. It was probably
for Alfonso that Titian made one of his finest pictures, The Tribute
Money: a Pharisee with the head of a philosopher, asking his question
sincerely, and a Christ answering without resentment, brilliantly.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the times that Titian could pass from Bacchus
to Christ, from Venus to Mary, and back again, with no apparent loss to
his</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>peace of mind. In 1518 he painted for the church of the Frari his
greatest work, The Assumption of the Virgin. When it was placed behind
die high altar, in a majestic marble frame, the Venetian diarist Sanudo
thought the event worth noting: “May 20, 1518: Yesterday the panel
painted by Titian for . . . the Minorites was pu t up.” 39 To this day
the sight of the Frari Assumption is an event in any sensitive life.
Near the center of the immense panel is the figure of the Virgin, full
and strong, clothed in a robe of red and a mantle of blue, rapt in
wonder and expectation, lifted up through the clouds by an inverted halo
of winged cherubim. Above her is an inevitably futile attempt to portray
the Deity — all raiment and beard, and hair di- sheveled by the winds of
heaven; finer is the angel that brings Him a crown for Mary. Below are
the Apostles, a variety of magnificent figures, some gazing in
astonishment, some kneeling in adoration, some reaching up as if to be
taken with her into paradise. Standing before this powerful evoca- tion,
the unwilling skeptic mourns his doubts, and acknowledges the beauty and
aspiration of the myth.</p>
<p>In 1519 Iacopo Pesaro, Bishop of Paphos in Cyprus, in gratitude for
the victory of his Venetian fleet over a Turkish squadron, commissioned
Titian to paint another altarpiece for the Frari — for the chapel that
had been dedi- cated there by his family. Titian knew the risk he was
running in challeng- ing comparison between this Madonna of the Pesaro
Family and his master- piece so lately acclaimed. He worked for seven
years on the new picture before he released it from his studio. He chose
to represent the Virgin en- throned; but, defying precedent, he placed
her at the right in a diagonal scheme that put the donor at the left,
with St. Peter between them, and St. Francis at her feet. The
composition would have been thrown off balance but for the bright
illumination focusing the Mother and her Child. Many an artist, tired of
the traditional centralized or pyramidal structure of such pictures,
welcomed and imitated the experiment.</p>
<p>About 1523 Marquis Federigo Gonzaga invited Titian to Mantua. The
artist did not stay long, for he had commitments in Venice and Ferrara;
but he began a series of eleven paintings representing Roman emperors;
these have been lost. On one of his visits he painted an attractive
portrait of the young bearded Marquis. Federigo’s mother, the splendid
Isabella, was still living, and sat for a picture. Finding the result
uncomfortably realistic, she put it among her antiquities, and asked
Titian to copy a portrait that Francia had made of her forty years
before. It was from this that Titian produced ( c . 1534) the famous
picture with the turban hat, the ornate sleeves, the stole of fur, the
pretty face. Isabella protested that she had never been so</p>

<p>CHAP. XI )</p>
<p>beautiful, but she arranged to have this reminiscent portrait descend
to pos- terity.</p>
<p>Here for a while we leave Tiziano Vecelli. To understand his later
ca- reer we must fill in the background of political events in which his
greatest patron after 1 533 — Charles V — was intimately concerned.
Titian was fifty- six in 1 533. Who would have supposed that he had
still forty-three years to live, and that he would paint as many
masterpieces in his second half-cen- tury as in the first?</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Minor Artists and Arts</li>
</ol>
<p>We must retrace our steps now, and briefly honor two painters who
were bom after Titian but died long before his death. We bow, in
passing, to Girolamo Savoldo, who came to Venice from Brescia and
Florence, and painted pictures of high excellence: the Madonna and
Saints now in the Brera Gallery; an ecstatic St. Matthew in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art; and a Magdalen in Berlin, far more tempting
than the stout lady of that name in Titian.</p>
<p>Giacomo Nigreti was named Palma from some hills near his birthplace,
Serina, in the Bergamasque Alps; he became Palma Vecchio when his grand-
nephew Palma Giovane also acquired fame. For a time he was considered
the equal of Titian by their contemporaries. Perhaps some jealousy arose
between them, which was not eased by Titian’s stealing of Giacomo’s mis
- tress. Giacomo had painted her as Violante; Titian had her pose for
his Flora. Like Titian, Palma handled sacred and profane themes with
equal skill if not with equal zest; he specialized in Sacred
Conversations or Holy Families, but probably owed his fame to his
portraits of Venetian blondes — full-bosomed women who dyed their hair
to an auburn hue. Nevertheless his finest pictures are religious: a
Santa Barbara in the church of Santa Maria Formosa, the patron saint of
the Venetian bombardiers; and the Jacob and Rachel of the Dresden
gallery — a handsome shepherd sharing a kiss with a buxom lass. Palma’s
portraits would have ranked with the best of his time and city had not
Titian produced half a hundred deeper ones.</p>
<p>His pupil Bonifazio de’ Pitati, called Veronese from his
birthplace,</p>
<p>adopted the style of Giorgione’s Fete champetre and Titian’s Diana to
adorn Venetian walls and furniture with attractive landscapes and nudes;
and his Diana and Actaeon is worthy of these masters.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Lotto, less popular than Bonifazio in their day, has gained
repute with the years. A shy, pious, melancholy spirit, he was not quite
at home</p>
<p>3 12</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>in Venice, where paganism resumed its sway as soon as the church
bells and choirs ceased to sing. At the age of twenty ( 1 500) he
produced one of the most original paintings of the Renaissance, the
St. Jerome in the Louvre: no hackneyed image of the emaciated eremite,
but an almost Chinese study of somber chasms and mountainous rocks, amid
which the old scholar is a minor element, at first hardly seen; this is
the first European painting that reproduces nature in its wild dominance
rather than as an imaginary back- ground. 40 Passing to Treviso, Lorenzo
painted for the church of Santa Cristina a monumental altar back of The
Madonna Enthroned, which made his fame throughout northern Italy.
Another success with a Madonna for the church of San Domenico at
Recanati earned him a call to Rome. There Julius II commissioned him to
paint some rooms in the Vatican; but when Raphael came the frescoes that
Lotto had begun were destroyed. Perhaps this humiliation helped to
darken Lorenzo ’s mood. Bergamo better appreci - ated his peculiar
talent for moderating the warm colors of Venetian art into softer tones
more congruous with piety; twelve years he labored there, modestly paid
but content to be first in Bergamo rather than fourth in Venice. For the
church of San Bartolommeo he painted an overcrowded but still beautiful
altarpiece, The Madonna in Majesty. Lovelier is an Ado- ration of the
Shepherds at Brescia; the color, while full and pervasive, has a subdued
tone more restful to eye and spirit than the brilliant effects of the
great Venetians.</p>
<p>A sensitive soul like Lotto’s could at times penetrate more deeply
into a personality than Titian. Few artists have caught the glow of
healthy youth so intimately as in Lotto’s Portrait of a Boy in the
Castello at Milan. His Self-Portrait shows Lorenzo himself apparently
well and strong, but he must have known much sickness and pain to
represent illness so sympatheti- cally as in The Sick Man of the
Borghese Gallery, or in another of the same title in the Galleria Doria
at Rome — an emaciated hand pressed over the heart, a look of pain and
bewilderment on the face, as if asking why should he, so good or so
great, be chosen by the germ? A more famous portrait, Laura di Pola,
shows a woman of quiet beauty, also puzzled by life, and finding no
answer except in religious faith.</p>
<p>Lotto too came to that consolation. Restless, solitary, unmarried, he
wandered from place to place, perhaps from philosophy to philosophy,
until in his final years (1552-6) he settled down as a resident in the
convent of the Santa Casa at Loreto, near the Holy House that pilgrims
believed to have once sheltered the Mother of God. In 1554 he gave all
his property to the convent, and took an oblate’s vows. Titian called
him “as good as good -</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 3 I 3</p>
<p>ness, and as virtuous as virtue.” 41 Lotto had outlived the Pagan
Renaissance, and had sunk to rest, so to speak, in the arms of the
Council of Trent.</p>
<p>In that vibrant century — 1450-1550 — during which Venetian commerce
suffered so many defeats, and Venetian painting scored so many
victories, the minor arts shared in the cultural exuberance. It was not
for them a Renaissance, for they were old and mature in Italy by
Petrarch’s t ime, and merely continued their medieval excellence.
Perhaps the mosaicists had lost some of their skill or patience; even so
their work on St. Mark’s was at least abreast of their age. The potters
w T ere now learning to make porcelain; Marco Polo had brought some from
China; a sultan had sent fine specimens of it to the doge (1461); by
1470 the Venetians were making their own. The glass blowers at Murano
reached in this period the acme of their art, making cristallo of
exquisite purity and design. The names of the leading glass blowers were
known throughout Europe, and every royal house com- peted for their
wares. A 4 ost of them used a mold or model; some put the mold aside,
blew a bubble into the molten glass as it poured from the fur- nace, and
shaped the substance into cups, vases, chalices, ornaments of a hundred
colors and a thousand forms. Sometimes, learning from the Mos- lems,
they painted the surface with colored enamel or gold. The glass arti-
sans kept jealously in their families the secret processes by which they
achieved their miracles of fragile beauty, and the Venetian government
passed stern laws to prevent these esoteric subleties from becoming
known in other lands. In 1454 the Council of Ten decreed that</p>
<p>if a workman carry into another country any art or craft to the</p>
<p>detriment of the Republic, he will be ordered to return; if he
dis-</p>
<p>obeys, his nearest relatives will be imprisoned, in order that the
soli- darity of the family may persuade him to return; if he persists in
his disobedience, secret measures will be taken to have him killed wher-
ever he may be. 4 “</p>
<p>The only known case of such an assassination was at Vienna in the
eight- eenth century. Despite the law, Venetian artists and artisans
found their way over the Alps in the sixteenth century, and brought
their technique to France and Germany as gifts to the conquerors of
Italy.</p>
<p>Half the artisans of Venice were artists. The pewterers
embellished</p>
<p>dishes, platters, beakers, and cups with graceful borders and floral
designs. The armorers were famous for damascened cuirasses, helmets,
shields, swords, and daggers, and sheaths chased or engraved with
elegant patterns; and other masters might make for short weapons ivory
handles studded</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>

<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>with gems. In Venice, about 1410, Baldassare degli Embriachi, a
Floren- tine, carved in bone the great altarpiece, in thirty-nine
sections, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The wood carvers
not only made fine sculptural figures and reliefs, like the Circumcision
in the Louvre, or the chest painted by Bartolommeo Montagna and formerly
in the bombed Poldi-Pezzoli Museum in Milan; they decorated the ceilings
and doors and furniture of Venetian aristocrats with carvings, bosses,
and intarsia, and chiseled the choir stalls of such churches as the
Frari and San Zaccaria. Venetian jewelers met a heavy foreign as well as
tomestie demand, but took time to rise from quantity to quality. The
goldsmiths, now under German instead of Oriental influenc:, turned out
tons of plate, personal adornment, and decorative fixtures for
everything from cathedrals to shoes. The illumination and calligraphy of
manuscripts continued, slow ly yielding to print. French and Flemish
influences entered into the designs cf Vene- tian textiles, but Venetian
dyes and skills gave the products their favored texture and hues. It was
from Venice that the queen of Fiance ordered three hundred pieces of
dyed satin (1532); and it was in the soft and luxu- rious stuffs worked
in Venetian shops, and in the colors given them in Venetian vats, that
the great painters of Venice found models for the lordly and glowing
robes that made half the brillance of their art. Venice almost realized
Ruskin’s ideal of an economy in which every industry would be an art,
and every product would proudly express the personality and artistry of
the artisan.</p>

<p>Venice was in this period too busy living to care much for books; and
still its scholars, libraries, poets, and printers shared in giving it a
fair name. It took no prominent part in the humanist movement;
nevertheless humanism had here one of its noblest exemplars — Ermolao
Barbaro, who was crowned poet by an emperor at fourteen, taught Greek,
translated Aristotle, served his fellow men as a physician, his country
as a diplomat, and his Church as a cardinal, and was killed by the
plague at thirty-nine. Venetian women made as yet little pretense to
education; they were content to be physically alluring, or maternally
fertile, or finally venerable; but in 1530 Irene of Spilimbergo opened a
salon for men of letters, studied painting under Ti- tian, sang sweetly,
played well on viol, harpsichord, and lute, and talked</p>
<p>VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>315</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>learnedly about ancient and modern literature. Venice gave protection
to intellectual refugees from the Turks in the East and from the
Christians in the West; here Aretino would laugh securely at popes and
kings, as, cen- turies later, Byron would here celebrate their decay.
Aristocrats and pre- lates formed clubs or academies for the cultivation
of music and letters, and opened their homes and libraries to the
assiduous, the melodious, and the erudite. Monasteries, churches, and
private families collected books; Cardi- nal Domenico Grimani had eight
thousand, which he gave to Venice; Cardinal Bessarion did the same with
his precious hoard of manuscripts. To house these, and the remnants of
Petrarch’s bequ est, the government twice ordered the erection of a
public library; war and other distractions foiled the plan; at last (153
6) the Senate engaged Iacopo Sansovino to build the Libreria Vecchia,
architecturally the most handsome library in Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Venetian printers were producing the finest printed books
of the age, perhaps of all time. They were not the first in Italy.
Sweynheim and Pannartz, once aides to Johann Fust in Mainz, set up the
first Italian press in a Benedictine monastery at Subiaco in the
Apennines (1464); in 1467 they transferred their equipment to Rome, and
published twenty- three books in the next three years. In 1469, or
earlier, printing began in Venice and Milan. In 1471 Bernardo Cennini
opened a printing establish- ment in Florence, to the dismay of
Politian, who mourned that “now the most stupid ideas can in a moment be
transferred into a thousand volumes and spread abroad.” 43 Copyists
thrown out of work vainly denounced the new gadget. By the end of the
fifteenth century 4987 books had been printed in Italy: 300 in Florence,
629 in Milan, 925 in Rome, 2835 in</p>
<p>Venice. 44</p>
<p>The superiority of Venice in this regard was due to Teobaldo Manucci,
who changed his name to Aldo Manuzio, and later Latinized it into Aldus
Manutius. Born at Bassiano in the Romagna (1450), he learned Latin at
Rome and Greek at Ferrara, both under Guarino da Verona; and then him-
self lectured at Ferrara on the classics. Pico della Mirandola, one of
his pu- pils, invited him to come to Carpi and tutor his two nephews,
Lionello and Alberto Pio. Teacher and pupils developed a lasting mutual
affection; Aldus added the name Pio to his own, and Alberto and his
mother, Count- ess of Carpi, agreed to finance the first large-scale
adventure in publishing. Aldus’ plan was to collect, edit, print, and
broadcast at nominal cost all the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>316</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>nearly all manuscripts were heavy with errors of transcription;
editors would have to be found and paid to collate and revise texts;
fonts of Latin and Greek type would have to be designed and cast; paper
would have to be imported in large quantities; typesetters and pressmen
would have to be engaged and trained; a machinery of distribution would
need to be impro- vised; a book-buying public would have to be coaxed
into existence on a wider base than ever before; and all this would have
to be financed without the protection of copyright laws.</p>
<p>Aldus chose Venice for his headquarters because its commercial
connec- tions made it an excellent center for distribution; because it
was the richest city in Italy, and had many magnates who might want to
adorn their rooms with uncut books; and because it harbored scores of
refugee Greek scholars who would be glad to be employed as editors or
proofreaders. John of Speyer had already established the first printing
press in Venice (1469?); Nicholas Jensen of France, who had learned the
new art in Gutenberg’s Mainz, set up another a year later. In 1479
Jensen sold his press to Andrea Torresano. In 1490 Aldus Manutius
settled in Venice, and in 1499 he mar- ried Torresano’s daughter.</p>
<p>In his home near the church of Sant’ Agostino Aldus gathered Greek
scholars, fed them, bedded them, and set them to editing classic texts.
He talked Greek with them, and wrote in Greek his dedications and
prefaces. In his house the new type was molded and cast, the ink was
made, the books were printed and bound. His first publication (1495) was
a Greek and Latin grammar by Constantine Lascaris, and in that same year
he began to issue the works of Aristotle in the original. In 1496 he
published the Greek grammar of Theodorus Gaza, and in 1497 a Greek-Latin
dictionary com- piled by himself. For he continued to be a scholar even
amid the hazards and tribulations of publishing. So in 1502, after years
of study, he printed his own Rudimenta grammaticae linguae Latinae, with
an introduction to Hebrew for good measure.</p>
<p>From these technical beginnings he went on to publish one after
another of the Greek classics (1495^: Musaeus ( Hero and Leander),
Hesiod,</p>
<p>Theocritus, Theognis, Aristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Sophocles,
Euripides, Demosthenes, Aeschines, Lysias, Plato, Pindar, Plutarch’s Mo
- ralia. … In those same years he put forth a large number of Latin and
Italian works, from Quintilian to Bembo, and the Adagia of Erasmus, who,
sensing the vital import of Aldo’s enterprise, came in person to live
with him for a time, and edit not only his own Adagia or Dictionary of
Quota- tions, but Terence, Plautus, and Seneca too. For the Latin books
Aldus had VENICE AND HER REALM</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>a graceful semiscript type designed, not, as legend said, from the
handwrit- ing of Petrarch, but by Francesco da Bologna, an expert
calligrapher; this is the type that we now, from that origin, call
italic. For the Greek texts he cut a font based on the careful
handwriting of his chief Greek scholar, Mar- cus Musurus of Crete. He
marked all his publications with a motto, Festina lente — “Make haste
slowly”— and accompanied it with a dolphin symboliz- ing speed and an
anchor standing for stability; this symbol, along with the pictured
tower that Torresano had used, established the custom of the printer’s
or publisher’s colophon.*</p>
<p>Aldus worked at hi s enterprise quite literally night and day. “Those
who cultivate letters,” he wrote, in his preface to Aristotle’s Organon,
“must be supplied with the books necessary for their purpose; and until
this supply is secured I shall not rest.” Over the door o f his study he
placed a warning inscription: “Whoever thou art, thou art earnestly
requested by Aldus to state thy business briefly, and to take thy
departure promptly. . . . For this is a place of work.” 45 He was so
absorbed in his publishing campaign that he neglected his family and his
friends, and ruined his health. A thou- sand tribulations sapped his
energy: strikes disrupted his schedule, war sus- pended it for a year
during the Venetian struggle for survival against the League of Cambrai;
rival printers in Italy, France, and Germany pirated the editions whose
manuscripts had cost him dearly, and whose texts he had paid scholars to
revise. But the sight of his small and handy volumes, clearly typed and
neatly bound, going forth to a widening public at a modest price (about
two dollars in the currency of today) gladdened his heart and re- paid
his toil. Now, he told himself, the glory of Greece would shine upon all
who cared to receive it. 46</p>
<p>Inspired by his devotion, Venetian scholars joined with him to found
the Neacademia, or New Academy (1500), dedicated to the acquisition,
edit- ing, and publishing of Greek literature. The members, at their
meetings, spoke only Greek; they changed their names to Greek forms;
they shared the tasks of editing. Distinguished men labored in this
Academy — Bembo, Alberto Pio, Erasmus of Holland, Linacre of England.
Aldus gave them much credit for the success of his enterprise, but it
was his own energy and passion that carried it through. He died
exhausted and poor (1515), but fulfilled. His sons continued the work;
but when their son, Aldo the sec- ond, died (1597), the firm dissolved.
It had served its purpose faithfully. It had taken Greek literature from
the half-hidden shelves of rich collec-</p>

<p>tors, and had scattered it so widely that even the ravaging of Italy
in the third decade of the sixteenth century, and the desolation of
northern Eu- rope by the Thirty Years’ War, could lose that heritage as
it had been so largely lost in the dying ages of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>2 . Bembo</p>
<p>Besides helping to revive the literature of Greece, the members of
the New Academy contributed vigorously to the literature of their time.
An- tonio Coccio, called Sabellicus, chronicled Venetian history in his
Decades. Andrea Navagero composed Latin poems so nearly perfect in form
that his proud countrymen hailed him as having snatched the leadership
of letters from Florence to Venice. Marino Sanudo kept a lively diary of
cur- rent events in politics, literature, art, manners, and morals; the
fifty-eight volumes of these Diarii picture the life of Venice more
fully and vividly than any history of any city in Italy.</p>
<p>Sanudo wrote in the racy language of daily speech; his friend Bembo
devoted half a long life to polishing an artificial style in Latin and
Italian. Pietro imbibed culture in his cradle, for he was the child of
rich and lettered Venetians. Moreover, as if to confirm his literary
purity, he was born in Florence, proud home of the Tuscan dialect. He
studied Greek in Sicily under Constantine Lascaris, and philosophy at
Padua under Pomponazzi. Perhaps, if we may judge from his conduct — for
he seldom took sin very seriously — he imbibed some skepticism from
Pomponazzi, who doubted the immortality of the soul; but he was too much
of a gentleman to disturb the consolations of the faithful; and when the
reckless professor was accused of heresy Bembo persuaded Leo X to deal
with him leniently.</p>
<p>Bembo’s happiest days were spent at Ferrara, from his twenty -eighth
to his thirty-sixth year (1498-1506). There he fell in love, if only in
a literary way, with Lucrezia Borgia, queen of that courtly court. He
forgot her dubious background at Rome in the lure of her quiet grace,
the glow of her “Titian” hair, the fascination of her fame; for fame
too, like beauty, can</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) VENICE AND HER REALM 319</p>
<p>When Bembo moved from Ferrara to Urbino (1506) he was at the</p>
<p>height of his charm. He was tall and handsome, of noble birth and
breed- ing, of distinguished presence without obtrusive pride; he could
write poetry in three languages, and his letters were already prized;
his con- versation was that of a Christian, a scholar, and a gentleman.
His Asolani, published during his stay at Urbino, fell in with the
spirit of that court. What topic could be more pleasant than love? —
what mise en scene fitter for such discourse than the gardens of
Caterina Cornaro at Asolo? — what occasion more suitable than the
wedding of one of her maids of honor? — who could better speak of love,
however Platonic, than the three youths and three maidens into whose
mouths Bembo put his savory mixture of philosophy and poetry? Venice,
whose artists took hints and scenes from the book, Ferrara, whose
Duchess received the adoring dedication, Rome, where ecclesiastics were
glad ragionar d’amore, Urbino, which boasted the author in the flesh —
all Italy acclaimed Bembo as a master of delicate senti- ment and
polished style. When Castiglione idealized in The Courtier the
discussions he had heard or imagined in the Ducal Palace at Urbino, he
gave to Bembo the most distinguished role in the dialogue, and chose him
to phrase the famed concluding passages on Platonic love.</p>
<p>In 1512 Bembo accompanied Giuliano de’ Medici to Rome. A year later
Giuliano’s brother became Leo X. Bembo was soon lodged in the
Vatican</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Venice, Ferrara, Urbino, Rome, he wrote such Latin</p>
<p>poetry as Catullus or Tibullus might have penned — elegies, idyls,
epitaphs, odes; many frankly pagan, some, like his Priapus, in the best
vein of Renais- sance licentiousness. The Latin of Bembo and Politian
was idiomatically perfect, but it came at the wrong time; had they been
born fourteen cen- turies earlier they would have been de rigueur in the
schools of modem Europe; writing in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, they could not be the voice of their country, their epoch,
even of their class. Bembo realized this, and in an essay Della volgar
lingua he defended the use of Italian for literary purposes. He tried to
show the way by composing canzoni in the manner of Petrarch; but here
his passion for polish devitalized his verse, and</p>
<p>3 2 °</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>turned his amours into poetic conceits. Nevertheless many of these
poems were set to music as madrigals, some by the great Palestrina
himself.</p>
<p>The sensitive Bembo found Rome a ghostly city after the death of his
friends Bibbiena, Chigi, and Raphael. He retired from his papal post</p>
<p>(1520), and, like Petrarch, sought health and ease in a rural home
near Padua. Now, at fifty, he fell in love in no mild Platonic way. For
the next twenty-two years he lived in a free union with Donna Morosina,
who gave him not only three children but such comforts and consolations,
such solici- tude and care, as had never graced his fame, and now came
doubly welcome to his declining years. He still enjoyed the income of
several ecclesiastical benefices. He used his wealth largely to collect
fine paintings and sculp- tures, and among them Venus and Jove held an
honored place beside Mary and Christ. 18 His home became a goal of
literary pilgrimage, a salon of artists and wits; and from that throne
he laid down the laws of style for Italy. Even while papal secretary he
had cautioned his associate Sadoleto to avoid reading the Epistles of
St. Paul, lest their unpolished speech of the commonalty should mar his
taste; “put away these trifles,” Bembo told him, “for such absurdities
do not become a man of dignity.” 49 All Latin, he told Italy, must be
modeled upon Cicero, all Italian upon Petrarch and Boccac- cio. He
himself, in his old age, wrote histories of Florence and Venice; they
are beautiful and dead. But when his Morosina died the great stylist
forgot his rules, forgot Plato and Lucrezia and Castiglione, and wrote
to a friend a letter that, perhaps alone of all that flowed from his
pen, invites remem- brance:</p>
<p>I have lost the dearest heart in the world, a heart which
tenderly</p>
<p>watched over my life — which loved it and sustained it neglectful</p>
<p>of its own; a heart so much the master of itself, so disdainful of
vain embellishments and adornments, of silk and gold, of jewels and
treas- ures of price, that it was content with the single and (so she
assured me) supreme joy of the love I bore it. This heart, moreover,
had</p>
<p>for vesture the softest, gracefulest, daintiest of limbs; it had at
its</p>
<p>service pleasant features, and the sweetest, most graciously endowed
form that I have ever met in this land.</p>
<p>He can never forget her dying words:</p>
<p>“I commend our children to you, and beseech you to have care</p>
<p>of them, both for my sake and for yours. Be sure they are your own,
for I have never deceived you; that is why I could take Our Lord’s</p>
<p>body just now with a soul at peace.” Then, after a long pause,
she</p>

<p>added, “Rest with God,” and a few minutes afterward closed her</p>
<p>eyes forever, those eyes that had been the clear-shining faithful
stars of my weary pilgrimage through life. 80</p>
<p>Four years later he was still mourning her. Losing his ties with
life, he became pious at last; and in 1539 Paul III could make him a
priest and a cardinal. For his remaining eight years he was a pillar and
exemplar of the Church.</p>

<p>If now, leaving the egregious Aretino to a later chapter, we move out
of Venice to her northern and western dependencies, we shall find there
too some radiance of the Golden Age. Treviso could boast that it had
begotten Lorenzo Lotto and Paris Bordone; and its cathedral had an
Annunciation by Titian and a fine choir designed by the innumerable
Lombardi. The little town of Pordenone gave its name to Giovanni Antonio
de’ Sacchi, and still shows in its duomo one of his chefs-d’oeuvre, a
Madonna with Saints and Donor. Giovanni was a man of buoyant energy and
self-confidence, ready of wit and sword, willing to undertake anything
anywhere. We find him painting in Udine, Spilimbergo, Treviso, Vicenza,
Ferrara, Mantua, Cremona, Piacenza, Geno a, Venice, forming his style on
Giorgione’s land - scapes, Titian’s architectural backgrounds, and
Michelangelo’s muscles. He gladly accepted an invitation to Venice
(1527), anxious to pit his brush against Titian’s; his St. Martin and
St. Christopher, p ainted for the church of San Rocco, achieved an
almost sculptural effect by modeling with light and shade; Venice hailed
him as a worthy rival of Titian. Pordenone re- sumed his travels,
married thrice, was suspected of killing his brother, was knighted by
King John of Hungary (who had never seen any of his pic- tures), and
returned to Venice (1533) to resume his duel with Titian. Hoping to prod
Titian on to finishing his battle picture in the Ducal Palace, the
Signory engaged Pordenone to do a panel on the opposite wall. The
competition between Leonardo and Michelangelo was here repeated (1538),
with a dramatic supplement: Pordenone wore a sword at his belt. His
canvas — splendid in color, too violent in action — was adjudged second
best, and Pordenone moved on to Ferrara to design some tapestries for
Ercole II. Two weeks after arrival he died. His friends said it was
poison- ing; his enemies said it was time.</p>
<p>Vicenza too had heroes. Bartolommeo Montagna founded a school of
painting rich in mid dling Madonnas. Montagna’s best is the Madonna En

<p>Verona, after a proud history of fifteen hundred years, became a Ve-
netian dependency in 1404, and remained so till 1796. Nevertheless she
had a healthy cultural life of her own. Her painters fell behind those
of Ven- ice, but her architects, sculptors, and woodworkers were not
surpassed in the “Most Serene” capital. The fourteenth -century tombs of
the Scaligers, though too ornate, suggest no lack of sculptors; and the
equestrian statue of Can Grande della Scala, with the flowing caparison
of the horse so viv- idly portraying motion, falls short only of the
masterpieces of Donatello and Verrocchio. The most sought-for wood
carver in Italy was Fra Gio- vanni da Verona. He worked in many cities,
but he devoted a large part of his life to carving and inlaying the
choir stalls of Santa Maria in Organo in his native city.</p>
<p>The great name in Veronese architecture was “that rare and universal
genius” (Vasari calls him), Fra Giocondo. Hellenist, botanist,
antiquarian, philosopher, and theologian, this remarkable Dominican
friar was also one of the leading architects and engineers of his time.
He taught Latin and Greek to the famous scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger,
who practised medicine in Verona before moving to France. Fra Giocondo
copied the inscriptions on the classic remains in Rome, and presented a
book on the subject to Lorenzo de’ Medici. His researches led to the
discovery of the greater part</p>

<p>tect. Giovanmaria Falconetto, after drawing all the antiquities of
his own locality, inarched off to Rome to do the same thing there, and
devoted twelve years, on and off, to the task. Returning to Verona, he
took the losing side in politics, and had to move to Padua. There Bembo
and Cor- naro encouraged him in the application of classical design to
architecture; and the generous centenarian housed, fed, financed, and
loved Giovanmaria to the end of the artist’s seventy -six years.
Falconetto designed a loggia for Cornaro’s palace in Padua, two of that
city’s gates, and the church of Santa</p>
<p>Michele Sanmicheli gave himself chiefly to fortification. Son and</p>
<p>nephew of Veronese architects, he went to Rome at sixteen, and
carefully measured the ancient buildings. After making a name for
himself in de- signing churches and palaces, he was sent by Clement VII
to build defenses for Parma and Piacenza. The distinguishing feature of
his military archi- tecture was the pentagonal bastion, from whose
projecting balcony guns could be fired in five directions. When he
examined the fortifications of Venice he was arrested as a spy; but his
examiners were so impressed by his knowledge that the Signory engaged
him to construct fortresses in Verona, Brescia, Zara, Corfu, Cyprus, and
Crete. Back in Venice, he built a massive fort on the Lido. In preparing
for the foundations he soon struck water. Following the example of Fra
Giocondo, he sank a double cordon of con- nected piles, pumped the water
from between the two circles, and set the foundations in this dry ring.
It was a hazardous undertaking, whose success was in doubt to the last
minute. Critics predicted that when heavy artillery should be fired from
this fort the structure would shake itself loose from its foundations
and collapse. The Signory placed in it the stoutest cannon in Venice,
and ordered them all fired at once. Pregnant women fled from the
neighborhood to avoid premature deliveries. The cannon were fired, the
fort stood firm, the mothers returned, and Sanmicheli was the toast of
Venice.</p>
<p>In Verona he designed two majestic city gates, adorned with Doric
col- umns and cornices; Vasari ranked these structures, architecturally,
with the Roman theater and amphitheater that had survived in Verona from
Roman days. He built the Palazzo Bevilacqua there, and the Grimani and
Mo- cenigo palaces; he reared a campanile for the cathedral, and a dome
for San Giorgio Maggiore. His friend Vasari tells us that though Michele
in youth had indulged in some moderate adultery, he became in later life
a model Christian, taking no thought for material gains, and treating
all men with</p>

<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>kindness and courtesy. He bequeathed his skills to Iacopo Sansovino
and a nephew whom he loved exceedingly. When news came to him that this
nephew had fallen in Cyprus while fighting for Venice against the Turks,
Sanmicheli developed a fever, and died in a few days, aged seventy-three
(i559)*</p>
<p>To Verona belonged the finest medalist of the Renaissance, perhaps of
all time . 51 Antonio Pisano, known to history as Pisanello, always
signed himself Victor, and thought of himself as a painter. Half a dozen
of his paintings survive, and they are of excellent quality;* but it is
not these that have sustained his name through the centuries.
Recapturing the skill and compact realism of Greek and Roman coin
designs, Pisanello molded little circular reliefs, seldom more than two
inches in diameter, combining finesse of workmanship with such fidelity
to truth that his medallions are the most trustworthy representations we
have of several Renaissance notables. These are not profound works; they
have no philosophical overtones; but they are treasures of painstaking
workmanship and historical illumination.</p>
<p>Excepting Pisanello and the Carotos, Verona, in painting, remained
medi- eval. After the fall of the Scaligers it subsided quietly into a
secondary role. It was not, like Venice, a Rialto where merchants from a
dozen lands rubbed elbows and faiths and wore out one another’s dogmas
with mutual attrition. It was not, like Lodovico’s Milan, a political
power, nor like Flor - ence a focus of finance, nor like Rome an
international house. It was not so close to the Orient, nor so
captivated by humanism, as to tincture its Christianity with paganism;
it continued content with medieval themes, and rarely reflected in its
art the sensuous zest that evoked the nudes of Giorgione and Titian,
Correggio and Raphael. In a later period one of its sons, who indeed is
known by its name, entered gaily into the pagan mood; but Paolo Veronese
became in life a Venetian rather than a Veronese. Verona was
becalmed.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century its painters were still abreast of their
times; note how Padua called one of them — Altichiero da Zevio — to
decorate the chapel of San Giorgio. Toward the end of that century
Stefano da Zevio went to Florence and learned the Giottesque tradition
from Agnolo Gaddi; returning to Verona he painted frescoes that
Donatello pronounced the</p>

<p>best yet done in those parts. His pupil Domenico Morone advanced upon
him by studying the works of Pisanello and the Bellini; the Defeat of
the Buonacolsi, in the Castello at Mantua, emulates the multitudinous
pano- ramas of Gentile. Domenico’s son Francesco, by his murals, helped
Fra Giovanni’s woodwork to make the sacristy of Santa Maria in Organo
one of the treasure rooms of Italy. Domenico’s pupil Girolamo dai Libri,
at the age of sixteen (1490), painted in the same favorite church an
altarpiece — Deposition from the Cross — “which when uncovered,” reports
Vasari, “ex - cited such wonder that the whole city ran to congratulate
the artist’s father”; 52 its landscape was one of the best in
fifteenth-century art. In an- other of Girolamo’s pictures (New York) a
tree was so realistically por - trayed that — on the word of a holy
Dominican — birds tried to perch on its branches; and the grave Vasari
himself avers that in a Nativity that Giro- lamo painted for Santa Maria
in Organo you might count the hairs on the rabbits. 53 Girolamo’s father
had received the name dai Libri from his skill in illuminating
manuscripts; the son carried on the art, and came to excel in it all
other miniaturists in Italy.</p>
<p>About 1462 Iacopo Bellini painted in Verona. One of the boys who</p>
<p>served him was Liberale, who later received the name of his city;
through this Liberale da Verona a touch of Venetian color and vitality
entered Ver- onese painting. Liberale, like Girolamo, found that he
prospered best by illuminating manuscripts; he earned 800 crowns
(0,000?) in Siena by his miniatures. Badly treated in his old age by his
married daughter, he be- queathed his estate to his pupil Francesco
Torbido, went to live with him, and died at the reasonable age of
eighty-five (1536). Torbido studied also with Giorgione, and improved
upon Liberale, who forgave him. Another of Liberale’s pupils,
Giovanfrancesco Caroto, was strongly i nfluenced by Mantegna’s masterly
polyptych in San Zeno. He went to Mantua to study with the old master,
and made such progress that Mantegna sent out Caroto’s work as his own.
Giovanfrancesco made excellent portraits of Guidobaldo and Elisabetta,
Duke and Duchess of Urbino. He returned to Verona a rich man, who could
afford, now and then, to speak his mind. When a priest accused him of
making lascivious figures, he asked, “If painted figures move you so,
how can you be trusted with flesh and blood?” 54 He was among the few
Veronese painters who wandered from religious themes.</p>
<p>If to these men we add Francesco Bonsignori, Paolo Morando, called
Cavazzolo, Domenico Brusasorci, and Giovanni Caroto

<p>younger brother), the roster of Veronese painters in the Renaissance
is relatively complete. They were almost all good men; Vasari has a
moral pat on the back for nearly every one of them; their lives were
orderly for artists, and their work had a placid and wholesome beauty
that reflected their natures and their environment. Verona sang a pious
and tranquil minor chord in the song of the Renaissance.</p>
