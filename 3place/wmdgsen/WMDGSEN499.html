<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XXXThe Genius of Islam</p>
<p>1258-1520</p>
<p>T HE Moslem world had sustained, from 1095 to 1291, a series of
assaults as violent and religious as those by which it later subdued the
Balkans and changed a thousand churches into mosques. Eight Crusades,
inspired by a dozen popes, had hurled the royalty, chivalry, and rabble
of Europe against Mohammedan citadels in Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine,
Egypt, and Tunisia; and though these attacks had finally failed, they
had gravely weakened the order and resources of the Moslem states. In
Spain the Crusades had suc- ceeded; there Islam had been beaten back
while its survivors were crowded into a Granada whose doom was leisurely
delayed. Sicily had been taken from Islam by the virile Normans. But
what were these wounds and ampu- tations compared with the wild and
ruinous descent of the Mongols (1219-</p>
<ol start="58" type="1">
<li>into Transoxiana, Persia, and Iraq? City after city that had been a
haven of Moslem civilization was subjected to pillage, massacre, and
fire — Bokhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Merv, Nishapur, Rayy, Herat, Baghdad.
. . . Provincial and municipal governments were shattered; canals,
neglected, succumbed to the swirling sand; commerce was put to flight;
schools and libraries were destroyed; scholars and scientists were
scattered, slaughtered, or enslaved. The spirit of Islam was broken for
almost a century. It slowly revived; and then Timur’s Tatars swept
across western Asia in a fre sh desolation, and the Ottoman Turks cut
their way through Asia Minor to the Bosporus. No other civilization in
history has known disasters so numerous, so widespread, and so
complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>And yet the Mongols, Tatars, and Turks brought their new blood to re-
place the human rivers they had shed. Islam had grown luxurious and
supine; Baghdad, like Constantinople, had lost the will to live by its
own arms; men there were so in love with easeful life that they half
invited death; that pic- turesque civilization, too, as well as the
Byzantine, was ripe to die. But so rich had it been that — like ancient
Greece and Renaissance Italy — it was able, by its salvaged fragments
and memories, to civilize its conquerors. Persia un- der the Mongol
Il-Khans developed an enlightened government, produced good literature
and majestic art, and graced history with a noble scholar, Rashidu’d
-Din. In Transoxiana Timur built almost as impressively as he had
destroyed; and amid his ravages he paused to honor Hafiz. In Anatolia

<p>XXXTurks were already civilized, and poets among them were as
plentiful as concubines. In Egypt the Mamluks continued to build like
giants; and in West Africa Islam fathered a philosopher-historian beside
whom the great- est pundits of contemporary Christendom were midges
snared and starved in the cobwebs of Scholasticism. And meanwhile Islam
was spreading through India to the farthest reaches of the East.</p>
<p>I. THE IL-KHANS OF PERSIA: 1265-1337</p>
<p>When Marco Polo set out across Persia (1271) to see the China of
Kublai Khan, he found himself within the Mongol Empire almost all the
way. His- tory had never before recorded so vast a realm. On the west it
touched the Dnieper in Russia; in the south it included the Crimea,
Iraq, Persia, Tibet, and India to the Ganges; in the east it embraced
Indochina, China, and Korea; in the north lay its original home,
Mongolia. Throughout these states the Mongol rulers maintained roads,
promoted commerce, protected travelers, and permitted freedom of worship
to diverse faiths.</p>
<p>Hulagu, grandson of Genghis Khan, after destroying Baghdad ( 1 258) ,
es- tablished a new capital at Maragha in northwest Persia. When he died
(1265) his son Abaqa became khan or prince of Persia, loosely subject to
the distant Kublai Khan; so began the Il-Khan dynasty that ruled Persia
and Iraq till</p>
<ol start="1337" type="1">
<li>Greatest of the line was Ghazan Khan. He was almost the shortest man
among his troops, but his will was stronger than their arms. He broke
off allegiance to the Great Khan in Mongolia or China, and made his
state an independent kingdom, with its capital at Tabriz. Envoys came to
him from China, India, Egypt, England, Spain. . . . He reformed
administration, stabilized the currency, protected the peasants from
landlords and robbers, and promoted such prosperity as recalled Baghdad
in its proudest days. At Tabriz he built a mosque, two colleges, a
philosophical academy, an ob- servatory, a library, a hospital. He set
aside the revenues of certain lands in perpetuity to support these
institutions, and secured for them the leading scholars, physicians, and
scientists of the age. He was himself a man of wide culture and many
languages, apparently including Latin. 1 For himself he raised a
mausoleum so majestic and immense that his death ( 1 304) seemed a
triumphal entry into a nobler home.</li>
</ol>
<p>Marco Polo described Tabriz as “a great and glorious city.” Fra
Oderic (1320) pronounced it “the finest city in the world for trade.
Every article</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GENIUS OF ISLAM 665</p>
<p>splendid bathhouses in the world.” 3 He calculated the population at
a mil - lion souls.</p>
<p>Uljaitu continued the enlightened policies of his brother Ghazan. His
reign saw some of the noblest architecture and illumination in Persian
his- tory. The career of his chancellor, Rashidu’d - Din Fadlu’llah,
illustrates the prosperity of education, scholarship, and literature at
this time. Rashidu’d - Din was born in 1247 at Hamadan, perhaps of
Jewish parentage; so his enemies held, citing his remarkable knowledge
of Mosaic Law. He served Abaqa as physician, Ghazan as premier, Uljaitu
as treasurer. In an eastern suburb of Tabriz he established the Rab‘
-i-Rashidi, or Rashidi Foundation, a spacious university center. One of
his letters, preserved in the Library of Cambridge University, describes
it:</p>
<p>In it we have built twenty-four caravanserais 〔inns〕 touching
the</p>
<p>sky, 1,500 shops surpassing pyramids in steadfastness, and 30,000</p>
<p>fascinating houses. Salubrious baths, pleasant gardens, stores,
mills, factories for cloth weaving and paper-making . . . have been
con-</p>
<p>structed. . . . People from every city and border have been removed
to the said Rab‘. Among them are 200 reciters of the Koran. . . . We</p>
<p>have given dwellings to 400 other scholars, theologians, jurists, and
traditionalists 〔Hadith scholars〕 in the street which is named
“The</p>
<p>Street of the Scholars”; daily payments, pensions, yearly clothing al
- lowances, soap money and sweets money have been granted for them all.
We have established 1,000 other students . . . and have given orders for
their pensions and daily pay … in order that they may be com-</p>
<p>fortably and peacefully occupied in acquiring knowledge and profit-
ing people by it. We have prescribed, too, which and how many</p>
<p>students should study with which professor and teacher; and after</p>
<p>ascertaining each knowledge- seeker’s aptness of mind and capability
of learning a particular branch of the sciences . . . we have
ordered</p>
<p>him to learn that science. . . .</p>
<p>Fifty skilled physicians who have come from the cities of Hindu-</p>
<p>stan, China, Misr 〔Egypt〕, and Sha’m 〔Syria〕 have all been
granted</p>
<p>our particular attention and favor in a thousand ways; we have</p>
<p>ordered that they should frequent our “House of Healing” 〔hospital〕
every day, and that every one should take ten students capable of</p>
<p>learning medicine under his care, and train them in the practice
of</p>
<p>this noble art. To each of the opticians and surgeons and bonesetters
who work in . . . our hospital we have ordered that five of the sons</p>
<p>of our servitors should be entrusted so as to be instructed in
the</p>
<p>oculist’s art, in surgery and bonesetting. For all these men … we</p>
<p>have founded a quarter behind our hospital . . . their street is
called “The Street of the Healers.” Other craftsmen and industrialists
too,</p>
<p>whom we have transferred from various countries, have been estab-
lished, each group in a particular street. 4</p>
<p>666 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXWe must marvel at the industry of a man who, while actively
sharing in the administration of a kingdom, found time and knowledge to
write five books on theology, four on medicine and government, and a
voluminous history of the world. Moreover, an admiring Moslem assures
us, Rashidu’d - Din could give to his writing only the time between
morning prayer and sunrise; however, there are cloudy days even in
Azerbaijan. He labored seven years on his Jami‘ut -Tcnvarikh, or
Compendium of Histories; he published it in two tremendous volumes,
which in English would make seven. Here were substantial accounts of the
Mongols from Genghis Khan to Ghazan; of the various Mohammedan states
and dynasties in Eastern and Western Islam; of Persia and Judea before
and after Mohammed; of China and India, with a full study of Buddha and
Buddhism; and a chasteningly brief report on the doings and ideas of
European kings, popes, and philosophers. Those who have read these
volumes — not yet translated into a European tongue — pronounce them the
most valuable and scholarly work in all the prose liter- ature of
Persia. Not only did Rashidu’d -Din use the archives of his own
government; he engaged Chinese scholars to secure for him Chinese
treaties and other documents, and he appears to have read these — and
Arabic, He- brew, Turkish, and Mongolian authorities — in their original
languages. 6</p>
<p>To transmit this Compendium to posterity despite time and war, Rashi-
du’d -Din sent copies to scattered libraries, had it translated and
disseminated in Arabic, and assigned revenues for making two copies
every year, one in Arabic, one in Persian, to be presented to some city
of the Moslem world. Nevertheless much of it has been lost, along with
his other works, and perhaps as the result of his political disaster. In
1312 Uljaitu associated with him Ali-Shah as co- chancellor of the
exchequer. Under Uljaitu’s successor, Abu Sa‘id, Ali -Shah spread divers
charges against his colleague, and per- suaded the Khan that Rashidu’d
-Din and his son Ibrahim had poisoned Uljaitu, The historian was
dismissed, and soon thereafter was put to death (1318), at the age of
seventy, along with one of his sons. His properties were confiscated,
his foundations were deprived of their endowments, and the suburb Rab‘
-i-Rashidi was plundered and destroyed.</p>
<p>Abu Sa’id made belated amends by appointing another son of the
historian his vizier. Ghiyathu’d - Din governed wisely and justly. After
Abu Sa’id’s death a period of anarchy brought the dynasty of the
Il-Khans to an end, and their realm was divided into petty states
ravaged by war and redeemed by poetry.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>HAFIZ: 1320-89</li>
</ol>
<p>For in Persia every other man wrote verses, and kings honored poets
only next to mistresses, calligraphers, and generals. In Hafiz’s time a
score of</p>
<p>THE GENIUS OF ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>66 7</p>
<p>Persian poets won renown from the Mediterranean to the Ganges and
from Yemen to Samarkand. All of them, however, bowed to Shamci’d -Din
Mu- hammad Hafiz, and assured him that he had surpassed the melodius 2
a‘di himself. He agreed with this estimate, and addressed himself
reverently:</p>
<p>I have never seen any poetry sweeter than thine, O Hafiz,</p>
<p>I swear it by that Koran which thou keepest in thy bosom.®</p>
<p>Hafiz means rememberer; it was a title given to anyone who, like our
poet, had memorized the whole Koran. Bom at Shiraz at a date and of
ancestry unknown, he soon fell into verse. His first patron was Abu
Ishaq, who had been appointed shah of Fars (southeastern Persia) by
Ghazan Khan. Abu Ishaq so loved poetry that he neglected government.
When warned that hostile forces were preparing to attack his capital,
Shiraz, he remarked what a fool a man must be to waste so fair a spring
on war. An insensitive general, Ibn-Muzaffar, captured Shiraz, killed
Abu Ishaq (1352), forbade the drink- ing of wine, and closed every
tavern in the town. Hafiz wrote a mournful elegy:</p>
<p>Though wine gives delight, and the wind distills the perfume</p>
<p>of the rose,</p>
<p>Drink not the wine to the strains of the harp, for the constable</p>
<p>is alert.</p>
<p>Hide the goblet in the sleeve of the patchwork cloak,</p>
<p>For the time, like the eye of the decanter, pours forth blood.</p>
<p>Wash the wine stain from your dervish cloak with tears,</p>
<p>For it is the season of piety, and the time of abstinence. 7</p>
<p>Muzaffar’s successor, finding prohibition impracticable, or having
discovered that wine-bibbers can be more easily ruled than puritans,
reopened the taverns, and Hafiz gave him immortality.</p>
<p>He followed Persian conventions in spending so many verses on wine;
at times he reckoned a glass of wine as “worth more than a virgin’s
kiss.” 8 But even the grape grows dry after a thousand couplets, and
soon Hafiz found love, virginal or practiced, indispensable to
poetry:</p>
<p>Knowest thou what fortune is? ’Tis beauty’s sight obtaining;</p>
<p>’Tis asking in her lane for alms, and royal pomp disdaining. 9</p>
<p>No freedom now seemed so sweet as love’s sl avery.</p>
<p>Our stay is brief, but since we may attain</p>
<p>The glory that is love, do not disdain</p>
<p>To hearken to the pleadings of the heart;</p>
<p>Beyond the mind life’s secret will remain.</p>
<p>668</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXLeave then your work and kiss your dear one now,</p>
<p>With this rich counsel I the world endow;</p>
<p>When spring buds lure, the wind deserts his mill</p>
<p>And gently glides to kiss the leafy bough</p>
<p>Belle of Shiraz, grant me but love’s demand,</p>
<p>And for your mole — that clinging grain of sand</p>
<p>Upon a cheek of pearl — Hafiz would give</p>
<p>All of Bokhara, all of Samarkand. . . .</p>
<p>If I with Fate but once might throw the dice,</p>
<p>I’d try a throw, no matter what the price,</p>
<p>To have my breath, O Love, be one with yours;</p>
<p>What need would I have then for paradise? . . .</p>
<p>He who of gold and silk your tresses spun,</p>
<p>Who made the red rose and the white rose one,</p>
<p>And gave your cheek to them for honeymoon —</p>
<p>Can He not patience give to me, His son ? 10</p>
<p>He seems at last to have cooled into marriage; if we interpret his
subtle verses rightly, he found a wife, and had several children, before
he could quite make up his mind between woman and wine. In some verses
he seems to mourn her death:</p>
<p>My lady, that did change this house of mine</p>
<p>Into a heaven when that she dwelt therein,</p>
<p>From head to foot an angel’s grace divine</p>
<p>Enwrapped her; pure she was, spotless of sin;</p>
<p>Fair as the moon her countenance, and wise;</p>
<p>Lords of the kind and tender glance, her eyes</p>
<p>With an abounding loveliness did shine.</p>
<p>Then said my heart: Here will I take my rest!</p>
<p>This city breathes her love in every part.</p>
<p>But to a distant bourne was she addressed,</p>
<p>Alas! he knew it not, alas, poor heart!</p>
<p>The influence of some cold malignant star</p>
<p>Has loosed my hand that held her; lone and far</p>
<p>She journey eth that lay upon my breast . 11</p>
<p>In any case he became domesticated, cultivated a quiet privacy, and
seldom stirred abroad; he would, he said, let his poems travel for him.
He was in- vited to many a royal court, and was moved for a moment to
accept Sultan Ahmad’s offer of a home in the royal palace at Baghdad .
12 But his love for Shiraz kept him prisoner; he doubted if paradise
itself had streams as lovely, or roses as red. He indited a laud, now
and then, to the Persian kinglets of his time, in hopes of a gift to
ease his poverty; for there were no publishers</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GENIUS OF ISLAM 669</p>
<p>in Persia to launch one’s ink upon public seas, and art had to wait,
hat in hand, in the antechambers of nobles or kings. Once, indeed, Hafiz
almost went abroad: an Indian shah sent him not only an invitation but
money for the trip; he set out, and reached Hormuz on the Persian Gulf;
he was about to board a ship when a tempest upset his imagination and
enamored him of stability. He returned to Shiraz, and sent the shah a
poem in lieu of himself.</p>
<p>The divan or collected poetry of Hafiz contains 693 poems. Most are
odes, some are quatrains, some are unintelligible fragments. They are
more difficult than Dante to translate, for they jingle with multiple
rhymes which in English would make doggerel, and they teem with
recondite allusions that tickled the wits of the time but now lie heavy
oil the wings of song. Often he can be better rendered in prose:</p>
<p>The night was about to fade when, drawn by the perfume of the</p>
<p>roses, I went down into the garden to seek, like the nightingale,
balm for my fever. In the shadow there gleamed a rose, a rose red as a
veiled lamp, and I gazed upon its countenance. . . .</p>
<p>The rose is lovely only because the face of my beloved is lovely.</p>
<p>. . . What were the fragrance of the greensward and -:he breeze that
blows in the garden were it not for the cheek of my beloved, which</p>
<p>is like a tulip? . . .</p>
<p>In the darkness of the night I sought to unloose my heart from
the</p>
<p>bonds of thy tresses, but I felt the touch of thy cheek, and drank
of</p>
<p>thy lips. I pressed thee to my breast, and thy hair enveloped me like
a flame. I pressed my lips to thine, and yielded up my heart and soul to
thee as in ransom. 13</p>
<p>Hafiz was one of those blessed and harassed souls who, through art,
poetry, imitation, and half-unconscious desire, have become so sensitive
to beauty that they wish to worship — with eyes and speech and
fingertips — every fair form in stone or paint or flesh or flower, and
suffer in stifled silence as beauty passes by; but who find, in each
day’s fresh revelation of loveliness or grace, some forgiveness for the
brevity of beauty and the sovereignty of death. So Hafiz mingled
blasphemies with his adoration, and fell into angry heresies even while
praising the Eternal One as the source from which all earthly beauty
flows.</p>
<p>Many have sought to make him respectable by interpreting his wine as
Spiritual Ecstasy, his taverns as monasteries, his flames as the Divine
Fire. It is true that he became a Sufi and a sheik, assumed the dervish
robe, and wrote poems of misty mysticism; but his real gods were wine,
woman, and song. A movement was begun to try him for unbelief, but he
escaped by pleading that the heretical verses were meant to express the
views of a Chris- tian, not his own. And yet he wrote:</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>(CHA .</p>
<p>XXXO zealot! think not that you are sheltered from the sin of
pride,</p>
<p>For the difference between the mosque and the infidel church is</p>
<p>but vanity , 14</p>
<p>where infidel , of course, means Christian. Sometimes it seemed to
Hafiz that God was but a figment of m an’s hope:</p>
<p>And He who draws us in these flashing days,</p>
<p>Whom we adore, though we know whom He slays,</p>
<p>He well may sorrow, for when we are gone,</p>
<p>He too will vanish in that selfsame blaze . 15</p>
<p>When he died his orthodoxy was so doubtful, and his hedonism so volu-
minous, that some objected to giving him a religious funeral; but his
friends saved the day by allegorizing his poetry. A later generation
enshrined his bones in a garden — the Hafiziyya — flaming with the roses
of Shiraz, and the poet’s pr ediction was fulfilled — that his grave
would become “a place of pilgrimage for the freedom- lovers of all the
world.” On the alabaster tomb - stone was engraved one of the master’s
poems, profoundly religious at last:</p>
<p>Where are the tidings of union? that I may arise —</p>
<p>Forth from the dust I will rise up to welcome thee!</p>
<p>My soul, like a homing bird, yearning for paradise,</p>

<li>TIMUR: 1336-1405</li>
</ol>
<p>We first hear of the Tatars as a nomad people of Central Asia, kin
and neighbors to the Mongols, and joining these in European raids. A
Chinese writer of the thirteenth century describes the common run of
them much as Jordanes had pictured the Huns a thousand years before:
short of stature, hideous of visage to those unfamiliar with them,
innocent of letters, skilled in war, aiming their arrows unerringly from
a speeding horse, and continuing their race by an assiduous polygamy. In
trek and campaigns they took with them bed and board — wives and
children, camels, horses, sheep, and dogs; pastured the animals between
battles, fed on their milk and flesh, clothed themselves with their
skins. They ate gluttonously when supplies were plentiful, but they
could bear hunger and thirst, heat and cold, “more pa - tiently than any
people in the world.” 17 Armed with arrows— sometimes tipped with
flaming naphtha — and cannon and all the medieval mechanisms of siege,
they were a fit and ready instrument for a man who dreamed of empire
with his mother’s milk.</p>
<p>When Genghis Khan died (1227) he divided his dominions among his four
sons. To Jagatai he gave the region around Samarkand, and the name of
this son came to be applied to the Mongol or Tatar tribes under his
rule. Timur (i.e., iron) was born at Kesh in Transoxiana to the emir of
one such tribe. According to Clavijo the new “Scourge of God” assumed
this func - tion precociously: he organized bands of young thieves to
steal sheep or cattle from near-by herds. 18 In one of these enterprises
he lost the third and fourth fingers of his right hand; in another he
was wounded in the heel, and so limped the rest of his life. 19 His
enemies called him Timur-i-Lang, Timur the Lame, which careless
Occidentals like Marlowe made into Tamburlane or Tamerlane. He found
time for a little schooling; he read poetry, and knew the difference
between art and degeneration. When he was sixteen his father bequeathed
to him the leadership of the tribe and retired to a monastery, for the
world, the old man said, is “no better than a golden vase filled with
serpents and scorpions.” * The father, we are told, advised his son
always to support religion. Timur followed the precept even to turning
men into minarets.</p>
<p>In 1361 the khan of Mongolia appointed Khoja Ilias governor of Trans-
oxiana, and made Timur one of Khoja’s councilors. But the energetic
youth was not ripe for statesmanship; he quarreled violently with other
members of Khoja’s staff, and was forced to flee from Samarkand into the
desert. He gathered some youthful warriors about him, and joined his
band with that</p>
<p>• This, however, is from Timur’s Memoirs (v, i ), supposedly dictated
by him in last years, but of doubtful authenticity.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXof his brother Amir Husein, who was in like straits. Wandering
from one hiding place to another, they were hardened in body and soul by
danger, homelessness, and poverty, until they were raised to moderate
fortune by be- ing employed to suppress a revolt in Sistan. So ripened,
they declared war on Khoja, deposed and slew him, and became joint
rulers, at Samarkand, over the Jagatai tribes (1365). Five years later
Timur connived at the as- sassination of Amir Husein, and became sole
sultan.</p>
<p>“In 769,” (1367) reads his dubious autobiography, “I entered my
thirty - third year; and being of restless disposition, I was much
inclined to invade some of the neighboring countries.” 20 Resting at
Samarkand during the winters, he marched forth almost every spring in a
new campaign. He taught the towns and tribes of Transoxiana to accept
his rule docilely; he conquered Khurasan and Sistan, and subdued the
rich cities of Herat and Kabul; he discouraged resistance and revolt by
savage punishments. When the city of Sabzawar surrendered after a costly
siege, he took 2,000 captives, “piled them alive one upon another,
compacte d them with bricks and clay, and erected them into a minaret,
so that men, being apprised of the majesty of his wrath, might not be
seduced by the demon of arrogance”; so the matter is reported by a
contemporary panegyrist. 21 The town of Zirih missed the point and
resisted; the heads of its citizens made more minarets. Timur overran
Azerbaijan, took Luristan and Tabriz, and sent their artists to
Samarkand. In 1387 Isfahan yielded, and accepted a Tatar garrison, but
when Timur had gone the population rose and slew the garrison. He
returned with his army, stormed the city, and ordered each of his troops
to bring him the head of a Persian. Seventy thousand Isfahan heads, we
are told, were set on the walls, or were made into towers to adorn the
streets. 22 Appeased, Timur reduced the taxes that the city had been
paying to its governor. The re- maining towns of Persia paid ransom
quietly.</p>
<p>At Shiraz in 1387, says a tradition too pretty to be trusted, Timur
sum- moned to his presence the town’s most famous citizen, and angrily
quoted to him the lines which had offered all Bokhara and Samarkand for
the mole on a lady’s cheek. “With the blows of my lustrous sword,” Timur
is said to have complained, “I have subjug ated most of the habitable
globe … to embellish Samarkand and Bokhara, the seats of my government;
and you, miserable wretch, would sell them both for the black mole of a
Turk of Shiraz!” Hafiz, we are assured, bowed low and said: “Alas, O
Prince, it is this prodigality which is the cause of the misery in which
you find me.” Timur so relished the reply that he spared the poet and
gave him a handsome gift. It is regret- table that no early biographer
of Timur mentions this charming incident. 28</p>
<p>While Timur was in south Persia word was brought to him that Tuqat-
mish, Khan of the Golden Horde, had taken advantage of his absence to
invade Transoxiana, and even to sack that picturesque Bokhara which
Hafiz</p>
<p>THE GENIUS OF ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>673</p>
<p>had valued at half a mole. Timur marched a thousand miles north
(consider the commissary problems involved in such a march), and drove
Tuqatmish back to the Volga. Turning south and west, he raided Iraq,
Georgia, and Armenia, slaughtering en route the heretical Sayyids, whom
he branded as “misguided communists.” 24 He took Baghdad (1393) at the
request of its inhabitants, who could no longer put up with the cruelty
of their Sultan Ahmed ibn Uways. Finding the old capital in decay, he
bade his aides re- build it; meanwhile he added some choice wives to his
harem, and a cele- brated musician to his court. Ahmed found asylum in
Brusa with the Ottoman Sultan Bajazet I; Timur demanded Ahmed’s
extradition; Bajazet replied that this would violate Turkish canons of
hospitality.</p>
<p>Timur would have advanced at once upon Brusa, but Tuqatmish had again
invaded Transoxiana. The angry Tatar swept across south Russia, and,
while Tuqatmish hid in the wilderness, he sacked the G olden Horde’s
cities of Sarai and Astrakhan. Unresisted, Timur marched his army
westward from the Volga to the Don, and perhaps planned to add all
Russia to his realm. Russians of all provinces prayed feverishly, and
the Virgin of Vladi- mir was borne to Moscow between lines of kneeling
suppliants who cried out, “Mother of God, save Russia!” The poverty of
the steppes helped to save it. Finding little to plunder, Timur turned
back at the Don, and led his weary and hungry soldiers back to Samarkand
(1395-96).</p>
<p>In India, said all reports, there was wealth enough to buy a hundred
Russias. Proclaiming that Moslem rulers in north India were too tolerant
of Hindu idolatry, and that all Hindus must be converted to
Mohammedanism, Timur, aged sixty-three, set out for India at the head of
92,000 men ( 1 398). Near Delhi he met the army of its Sultan Mahmud,
defeated him, slaughtered 100,000 (?) prisoners, pillaged the capital,
and brought back to Samarkand all that his troops and beasts could carry
of the fabled riches of India.</p>
<p>In 1399, still remembering Ahmed and Bajazet, he marched forth again.
He crossed Persia to Azerbaijan, deposed his wastrel son as governor
there, hanged the poets and ministers who had seduced the youth into
revelry, and redevastated Georgia. Entering Asia Minor, he besieged
Sivas, resented its long resistance, and, when it fell, had 4,000
Christian soldiers buried alive — or were such stories war propaganda?
Wishing to protect his flank while attacking the Ottomans, he sent an
envoy to Egypt proposing a nonaggres- sion pact. The Sultan al-Malik
imprisoned the envoy and hired an assassin to kill Timur. The plot
failed. After reducing Aleppo, Hims, Baalbek, and Damascus, the Tatar
moved on to Baghdad, which had expelled his ap- pointees. He took it at
great cost, and ordered each of his 20,000 soldiers to bring him a head.
It was done — or so we are told: rich and poor, male and female, old and
young, paid this head tax, and their skulls were piled in ghastly
pyramids before the city’s gates (1401). Moslem mosques, monas -</p>
<p>674 THE reformation (chap, xxx</p>
<p>teries, and nunneries were spared; everything else was sacked and
destroyed, so thoroughly that the once brilliant capital recovered only
in our time, by the grace of oil.</p>
<p>Feeling now reasonably sure on left and right, Timur sent Bajazet a
final invitation to submit. The Turk, made too confident by his triumph
at Nicop- olis (1396), retorted that he would annihilate the Tatar army,
and would make Timur’s chie f wife his slave. 25 The two ablest generals
of the age joined battle at Ankara (1402). Timur’s strategy compelled
the Turks to fight when exhausted by a long march. They were routed.
Bajazet was taken prisoner, Constantinople rejoiced, Christendom was for
half a century saved by the Tatars from the Turks. Timur continued
Europeward to Brusa, burned it, and carried away its Byzantine library
and silver gates. He marched to the Mediterranean, captured Smyrna from
the Knights of Rhodes, butchered the inhabitants, and rested at Ephesus.
Christendom trembled again. The Genoese, who still held Chios, Phocaea,
and Mitylene, sent in their submission and tribute. The Sultan of Egypt
released the Tatar envo y, and entered the distinguished company of
Timur’s vassals. The con - queror returned to Samarkand as the most
powerful monarch of his time, ruling from Central Asia to the Nile, from
the Bosporus to India. Henry IV of England sent him felicitations,
France sent him a bishop with gifts, Henry III of Castile dispatched to
him a famous embassy under Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo.</p>
<p>It is to Clavijo’s detailed memoirs that we owe most of our knowledge
of Timur’s court. He left Cadiz on May 22, 1403, traveled v ia
Constantinople, Trebizond, Erzerum, Tabriz, Tehran (here first mentioned
by a European), Nishapur, and Mashhad, and reached Samarkand on August
31, 1404. He had with some reason expected to find there only a horde of
hideous butchers. He was astonis hed at the size and prosperity of
Timur’s capital, the splendor of the mosques and palaces, the excellent
manners of the upper class, the wealth and luxury of the court, the
concourse of artists and poets celebrating Timur. The city itself, then
over 2,000 years old, had some 150,000 inhabit- ants, and “most noble
and beautiful houses,” and many palaces “embowered among trees”;
altogether, and not including the extensive suburbs, Clavijo reckoned
Samarkand to be “rather larger than Seville.” Water was piped into the
houses from a river that ran by the city, and irrigation canals greened
the hinterland. There the air was fragrant with orchards and vineyards;
sheep grazed, cattle ranged, lush crops grew. In the town were factories
that made artillery, armor, bows, arrows, glass, porcelain, tiles, and
textiles of unsur- passed brilliance, including the kirimze or red dye
that gave its name to crim- son. Working in shops or fields, dwelling in
houses of brick or clay or wood, or taking their ease urbanely on the
riverside promenade, were Tatars, Turks, Arabs, Persians, Iraoi,
Afghans, Georgians, Greeks, Armenians.</p>

<p>&lt;5 75</p>
<p>Catholics, Nestorians, Hindus, all freely practicing their rites and
preaching their contradictory creeds. The principal streets were
bordered with trees, shops, mosques, academies, libraries, and an
observatory; a great avenue ran in a straight line from one end of the
city to the other, and the main section of this thoroughfare was covered
with glass. 28</p>
<p>Clavijo was received by the Tatar emperor on September 8. He passed
through a spacious park “wherein were pitched many tents of silk,” and
pavilions hung with silk embroideries. The tent was the usual abode of
the Tatar; Timur himself, in this park, had a tent 300 feet in
circumference. But there were palaces there too, with floors of marble
or tile, and sturdy furni- ture inset with precious stones or sometimes
altogether made of silver or gold. Clavijo found the monarch seated
cross- legged on silken cushions “un - der the portal of a most
beautiful palace,” facing a fountain that threw up a column of water
which fell into a basin wherein apples bobbed incessantly. Timur was
dressed in a cloak of silk, and wore a high, wide hat studded with
rubies and pearls. He had once been tall, vigorous, and alert; now, aged
sixty- eight, he was bent, weak, ailing, almost blind; he could barely
raise his eyelids to see the ambassador.</p>
<p>He had acquired as much culture as a man of action could bear; he
read history, collected art and artists, befriended poets and scholars,
and could on occasion assume elegant manners. His vanity equaled his
ability, which no one exceeded in that time. Contradicting Caesar, he
reckoned cruelty a necessary part of strategy; yet, if we may believe
his victims, he seems to have been often guilty of cruelty as mere
revenge. Even in civil government he conferred death lavishly — as to a
mayor who had oppressed a city, or a butcher who had charged too much
for meat. 27 He excused his harshness as needed in ruling a people not
yet reconciled to law, and he justified his mas- sacres as means of
forcing disorderly tribes into the order and security of a united and
powerful state. But, like all conquerors, he loved power for its own
sake, and spoils for the grandeur they could finance.</p>
<p>In 1405 he set out to conquer Mongolia and China, dreaming of a half-
world state that would wed the Mediterranean to the China Sea. His army
was 200,000 strong; but at Otrar, on the northern border of his realm,
he died. His last orders were that his troops should march on without
him; and for a while his white horse, saddled and riderless, paced the
host. But his soldiers well knew that his mind and will had been half
their might; soon they turned back, mourning and relieved, to their
homes. His children built for him at Samarkand the majestic Gur-i-Mir,
or Mausoleum of the Emir, a tower crowned with a massive bulbous dome,
and faced with bricks enam- eled in lovely turquoise blue.</p>
<p>His empire crumbled with his brain. The western provinces almost at
once fell away, and his progeny had to content themselves with the

<p>XXXEast. The wisest of this Timurid line was Shah Rukh, who allowed
his son Ulug to govern Transoxiana from Samarkand, while he himself
ruled Khu- rasan from Herat. Under these descendants of Timur the two
capitals be- came rival centers of a Tatar prosperity and culture equal
to any in Europe at the time (1405-49) . Shah Rukh was a competent
general who loved peace, favored letters and art, and founded a famous
library at Herat. “Herat,” wrote a Timurid prince, “is the garden of the
world.” 28 Ulug Beg cherished scientists, and raised at Samarkand the
greatest observatory of the age. He was, says a florid Moslem
biographer,</p>
<p>learned, just, masterful, and energetic, and attained to a high
degree in astronomy, while in rhetoric he could split hairs. In his
reign the</p>
<p>status of men of learning reached its zenith. … In geometry he
ex-</p>
<p>pounded subtleties, and on questions of cosmography he elucidated</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s Almagest Until now no mon arch like him has ever sat</p>
<p>on a throne. He recorded observations of the stars with the co-opera-
tion of the foremost scientists. … He constructed in Samarkand a</p>
<p>college the like of which, in beauty, rank, and worth, is not to
be</p>
<p>found in the seven climes. 29</p>
<p>This paragon of patronage was murdered in 1449 by his bastard son;
but the high culture of the Timurid dynasty continued under the sultans
Abu Sa‘id and Husein ibn -Baiqara at Herat till the end of the fifteenth
century. In 1501 the Uzbeg Mongols captured Samarkand and Bokhara; in
1510 Shah Ismail, of the new Safavid dynasty, took Herat. Babur, last of
the Timurid rulers, fled to India, and founded there a Mogul (Mongol)
dynasty which made Moslem Delhi as brilliant a capital as Medicean
Rome.</p>
<p>rv. THE MAMLUKS: I34O-1517</p>
<p>While Islam in Asia suffered repeated invasions and revolutions,
Eg)pt was exploited with relative stability by the Mamluk sultans
(1250-1517). The Black Death destroyed Egyptian prosperity for a time,
but through such vicissitudes the Mamluks continued to reconcile
competent administration and artistic interests with embezzlement and
atrocity. In 1381, however, with Sultan Malik al-Nasir Barquq, the Burji
Mamluks began a dynasty of luxury, intrigue, vio- lence, and social
decay. They debased the coinage even beyond the custom of governments,
taxed the necessaries of life, abused the state monopoly of sugar and
pepper, and laid such heavy dues at Alexandria on European trade with
India that Occidental merchants were provoked into finding a route to
India around Africa. Within a generation after Vasco da Gama’s voyage
(1498) Egypt lost much of its once rich share of the commerce between
East and West; and this economic disaster reduced the country to such
destitution that it offered</p>

<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>677</p>
<p>only feeble resistance when Selim I ended the Mamluk rule and made
Egypt a province of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Cairo remained from 1258 to 1453 the richest, fairest, and most
populous city in Islam. Ibn-Batuta described it glowingly in 1326; and
Ibn-Khaldun, visiting it in 1383, called it “the metropolis of the
universe, the garden of the world, the ant heap of the human species,
the throne of royalty; a city adorned with palaces and chateaux,
convents, monasteries, and colleges, and illumined by the stars of
erudition; a paradise so bounteously watered by the Nile that the earth
seems here to offer its fruits to men as gifts and salutations” 30 — to
which the toilsome fellaheen might have demurred.</p>
<p>The Egyptian mosques of this age reflected the severity of the
government rather than the colors of the sky. Here were no “ivans” or
portals of glazed brick and tinted tile as in Islamic Asia, but massive
stone walls that made the mosque a fortress rather than a house of
prayer. The mosque (1356-63) of Sultan Hassan was the wonder of its age,
and is still the stateliest monument of Mamluk art. The historian al-
Maqrizi thought that “it surpassed all other mosques ever built,” 31 but
he was a Cairene patriot. An uncertain tradition tells how the Sultan
collected renowned architects from many lands, asked them to name the
tallest edifice on earth, and bade them erect a loftier one. They named
the palace of Khosru I at Ctesiphon, whose surviving arch rises 105 feet
from the ground. Stealing stones from crumbling pyramids, their workmen
built the walls of the new mosque up to 100 feet, added a cornice for
thirteen feet more, and raised at one corner a minaret to 280 feet. The
gloomy towering mass im- presses, but hardly pleases, the Western eye;
the Cairotes, however, were so proud of it that they invented or
borrowed a legend in which the Sultan cut off the right hand of the
architect lest he should ever design an equal master- piece — as if an
architect designed with his hand. More attractive, despite their
function, were the funerary mosques that the Mamluk sultans built
outside Cairo’s walls to embalm their bones. Sultan Barquq al -Zahir,
who began life as a Circassian slave, ended in mute glory in the most
splendid of these tombs.</p>
<p>The greatest builder among the Burji Mamluks was Qa‘it Bey. Though
harassed by war with the Turks, he managed to finance costly edifices in
Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem; restored in Cairo the Citadel of Saladin
and the univer- sity mosque of el-Azhar; built a hotel famous for its
arabesques of stone; raised within the capital a mosque with ornate
ornament; and crowned his demise with a memorial mosque, in granite and
marble, whose superb decoration, lofty balconied minaret, and
geometrically carved dome make it one of the lesser victories of Moslem
art.</p>
<p>All the minor arts flourished under the Mamluks. Carvers in ivory,
bone, and wood made a thousand handsome products, from pen boxes to
pulpits, con- ceived with taste and executed with unremitting industry
and skill; witness the pulpit from Qa‘it Bey’s extramural mosque, in the
Victoria and A lbert Museum. Gold and silver inlay reached its peak
during these bloody dynasties. And Egyptian pottery, which had invented
a thousand novelties in its immemorial millenniums, now gave the world
enameled glass: mosque lamps, beakers, vases.</p>

Moslem artists, giving beauty a lasting form, atoned for the barbarities
of their kings.</p>
<p>V. THE ottomans: 1288-1517</p>
<p>History begins after origins have disappeared. No one knows where the
“Turks” arose; some have guessed that they were a Finno -Ugric tribe of
the Huns, and that their name meant a helmet, which is durko in one
Turkish dialect. They formed their languages from Mongolian and Chinese,
and later imported Persian or Arabic words; these “Turkish” dialects are
the sole means of classify - ing their speakers as Turks. One such clan
took its name from its leader Seljuq; it grew from victory to victory,
until its multiplied descendants, in the thirteenth century, ruled
Persia, Iraq, Syria, and Asia Minor. A kindred clan under Ortogh- rul
fled in that century from Khurasan to avoid drowning in the Mongol
inunda- tion. It found military employment with the Seljuq emir of Konya
(Iconium) in Asia Minor, and received a tract of land to pasture its
herds.</p>
<p>When Ortoghrul died (1288?) his son Othman or Osman, then thirty
years old, was chosen to succeed him; from him the Ottomans or Osmanlis
received their name. They did not, before the nineteenth century, call
themselves Turks; they applied that name to semi-barbarous peoples in
Turkestan and Khurasan. In 1290, seeing that the Seljuqs were too weak
to prevent him, Othman made himself the independent emir of a little
state in northwestern Asia Minor; and in 1299 he advanced his
headquarters westward to Yeni-Sheir. He was not a great general, but he
was patiently persistent; his army was small, but it was composed of men
more at home on horse than on foot, and willing to risk a weary life or
limb for land, gold, women, or power. Between them and the Sea of
Marmora lay drowsy Byzantine cities ill governed and poorly defended.
Othman laid siege to one such town, Brusa; failing at first, he returned
again and again to the attempt; finally it surrendered to his son
Orkhan, while Othman himself Jay dying at Yeni-Sheir (1326),</p>
<p>Orkhan made Brusa, sanctified with his father’s bones, the new
capital of the Ot tomans. “Manifest destiny”— i.e., desire plus power —
drew Orkhan toward the Mediterranean, ancient circlet of commerce,
wealth, and civilization. In the very year of Brusa’s fall he seized
Nicomedia, which became Izmid; in 1330 Nicaea, which became Iznik; in
1336 Pergamum, which became Bergama. These cities, reeking with history,
were centers of crafts and trade; they depended for food and markets
upon environing agricultural communities already held by the Ottomans;
they had to live with this hinterland or die. They did not resist long;
they had been oppressed by their Byzantine governors, and heard that
Orkhan taxed lightly and allowed religious liberty; and many of these
Near Eastern Christians were harassed heretics — Nestorians or
Monophysites. Soon a large part of the conquered terrain accepted the
Moslem creed; so war solves theologi-</p>
<p>CHAP, XXX ) THE GENIUS OF ISLAM 67 problems before which reason
stands in hesitant impotence. Having thus extended his realm, Orkhan
took the title Sultan of the Ottomans. The Byzan- tine emperors made
their peace with him, hired his soldiers, and allowed his son Suleiman
to establish Ottoman strongholds on European soil. Orkhan died in 1 359,
aged seventy-one, firmly placed in the memory of his people.</p>
<p>His successors formed a dynasty hardly equaled in history for a
merger of martial vigor and skill, administrative ability, barbarous
cruelty, and cultured devotion to letters, science, and art. Murad
(Amurath) I was the least attractive of the line. Illiterate, he signed
his name by pressing his inked fingers upon documents, in the fashion of
less distinguished homicides. When his son Saondji led a criminally
unsuccessful revolt agai nst him Murad tore out the youth’s eyes, cut
off his head, and compelled the fathers of the rebels to behead their
sons. 32 He trained an almost invincible army, conquered most of the
Balkans, and eased their submission by giving them a more efficient
government than they had known under Christian domination.</p>
<p>Bajazet I inherited his father’s crown on the field of Kosova (1389).
After leading the army to victory, he ordered the execution of his
brother Yakub, who had fought valiantly throughout that crucial day.
Such fratricide became a regular aftermath of an Ottoman accession, on
the principle that sedition against the government is so disruptive that
all potential claimants to the throne should be disposed of at the
earliest convenience. Bajazet earned the title of Yilderim — the
Thunderbolt — by the speed of his military strategy, but he lacked the
states- manship of his father, and wasted some of his wild energy in
sexual enterprise. Stephen Lazarevitch, vassal ruler of Serbia,
contributed a s ister to Bajazet’s harem; this Lady Despoina became his
favorite wife, taught him to love wine and sumptuous banquets, and
perhaps unwittingly weakened him as a man. His pride flourished till his
fall. After deflowering Europe’s chivalry at Nicopolis he released the
Count of Nevers with a characteristic challenge, as reported or improved
by Froissart:</p>
<p>John, I know well thou art a great lord in thy country, and son
to</p>
<p>a great lord. Thou art young, and peradventure thou shalt bear some
blame or shame that this adventure hath fallen to thee in thy first</p>
<p>chivalry; and to excuse thyself of this blame, and to recover
thine</p>
<p>honor, peradventure thou wilt assemble a puissance of men, and come
co make war against me. If I were in doubt or fear thereof, ere thou
departed I should cause thee to swear by thy law and faith that never
thou, nor none of thy company, should bear arms . . . against me. But I
will neither make thee nor none of thy company to make any such oath or
promise, but I will that when thou art returned and art at thy pleasure,
thou shalt raise what puissance thou wilt, and spare not, but come
against me; thou shalt find me always ready to receive thee and thy
company. . . . And this that I say, show it to whom thou list, for</p>
<p>I am able to do deeds of arms, and every ready to conquer further</p>

<p>XXXWhen Timur captured Bajazet at Ankara he treated him with ail
respect despite the year of insulting correspondence that had passed
between them. He ordered the Sultan’s bonds removed, seated him at his
side, assured him that his life would be spared, and directed that three
splendid tents should be fitted out for his suite. But when Bajazet
tried to escape he was confined to a room with barred windows, which
legend magnified into an iron cage. Bajazet fell ill; Timur summoned the
best physicians to treat him, and sent the Lady Despoina to attend and
console him. These ministrations failed to revive the vital forces of
the broken Sultan, and Bajazet died a prisoner, a year after his
defeat.</p>
<p>His son Mohammed I reorganized the Ottoman government and power.
Though he blinded one pretender and killed another, he acquired the
cognomen “Gentleman” by his courtly manners, his just rule, and the ten
years of peace that he allowed to Christendom. Murad II had like tastes,
and preferred poetry to war; but when Constantinople set up a rival to
depose him, and Hungary violated its pledge of peace, he proved himself,
at Varna (1444), as good a general as any. Then he retired to Magnesia
in Asia Minor, where twice a week he held reunions of poets and pundits,
read verse, and talked science and philosophy. A revolt at Adrianople
called him back to Europe; he suppressed it, and overcame Hunyadi Janos
in a second battle of Kosovo. When he died (1451), after thirty years of
rule, Christian historians ranked him among the greatest monarchs of his
time. His will directed that he should be buried at Brusa in a modest
chapel without a roof, “so that the mercy and blessing of God might come
unto him with the shining of the sun and moon, and the falling of the
rain and dew upon his grave.” 34</p>
<p>Mohammed II equaled his father in culture and conquests, political
acumen, and length of reign, but not in justice or nobility. Bettering
Christian instruction, he broke solemn treaties, and tarnished his
victories with superfluous slaughter. He was Orientally subtle in
negotiation and strategy. Asked what his plans were, he answered, “If a
hair in my beard knew, I would pluck it out.” 35 He spoke five
languages, was w r ell read in several literatures, excelled in
mathematics and engineering, cultivated the arts, gave pensions to
thirty Ottoman poets, and sent royal gifts to poets in Persia and India.
His grand vizier, Mahmud Pasha, seconded him as a patron of letters and
art; he and his master supported so many colleges and pious foundat ions
that the Sultan received the name “Father of Good Works.” Mohammed was
also “Sire of Victory”; to him and his cannon Constantinople fell; under
the guns of his navy the Black Sea became a Turkish pond; before his
legions and diplomacy the Balkans crumbled into servitude. But this
irresistible conqueror could not conquer himself. By the age of fifty he
had worn himself out by every form of sexual excess; aphrodisiacs failed
to implement his lust; finally his harem classed him with his eunuchs.
He died (1481), aged fifty-one, just when his army seemed on the verge
of conquering Italy for Islam.</p>
<p>A contest among his sons gave the throne to Bajazet II. The new
sultan was not inclined to war, but when Venice took Cyprus, and
challenged Turkish control of the eastern Mediterranean, he roused
himself, deceived his deceivers</p>

<p>with a pledge of peace, built an armada of 270 vessels, and destroyed
a Venetian fleet off the coasts of Greece. A Turkish army raided
northern Italy as far west as Vicenza (1502); Venice sued for peace;
Bajazet gave her lenient terms, and retired to poetry and philosophy.
His son Selim deposed him, and mounted the throne (1512); presently —
some said of poison — Bajazet died.</p>
<p>History is in some aspects an alternation of contrasting themes: the
moods and forms of one age are repudiated by the next, which tires of
tradition and lusts for novelty; classicism begets romanticism, which
begets realism, which begets impressionism; a period of war calls for a
decade of peace, and peace prolonged invites aggressive war. Selim I
despised his father’s pacific policy.</p>
<p>Vigorous in frame and will, indifferent to pleasures and amenities,
loving the chase and the camp, he won the nickname of “the Grim” by
having nine relatives strangled to contracept revolt, and waging war
after war of conquest. It did not displease him that Shah Ismafil of
Persia raided the Turkish frontier. He registered a vow that if Allah
would grant him victory over the Persians, he would build three mighty
mosques — in Jerusalem, Buda, and Rome. 36 Having heated the religious
predilections of his people to the fighting point, he marched against
Isma’il, captured Tabriz, and made northern Mesopotamia an Ottoman
province. In 1515 he turned his artillery and Janissaries against the
Mamluks, and added Syria, Arabia, and Egypt to his realm (1517). He
carried to Constantinople, as an honored captive, the Cairene “caliph”—
rather the high priest — of orthodox Mohammedanism; and thereafter the
Ottoman sultans, like Henry VIII, be- came the masters of the church as
well as of the state.</p>
<p>In the full glory of his powers Selim prepared to conquer Rhodes and
Christendom. When all his preparations were complete he caught the
plague and died (1520). Leo X, who had trembled more at Selim’s advance
than at Luther’s rebellion, ordered all Christian churches to chant a
litany of gratitude to God.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ISLAMIC LITERATURE: 14OO-152O</li>
</ol>
<p>Even Selim the Grim threaded verses on rhyme, and bequeathed to
Suleiman the Magnificent a royal divan of his collected poems as well as
an empire ranging from the Euphrates to the Danube and the Nile. Twelve
sultans and many princes — including that Prince Djem whom his brother
Bajazet II paid Christian kings and popes to keep in refined confinement
— appear among the 2,200 Ottoman poets who have won fame in the last six
centuries. 37 Most of these bards took their forms and ideas, sometimes
the language, of their verse from the Persians; they continued to
celebrate, in endless rivulets of rhyme, the greatness of Allah, the
wisdom of the shah or sultan, and the trembling envy of the cypress
trees seeing the white slenderness of the beloved’s legs. We of the West
are now too familiar with these charms to thrill to such lofty similes;
but the “terrible Turks,” whose women were alluringly robed from nose to
toes, were stirred to the roots by these poetic revelations; and the
poetry that in its denatured</p>
<p>682 THE REFORMATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXtranslation leaves us unmoved could inspire them to piety,
polygamy, and war.</p>
<p>From a thousand dead immortals we cull with untutored fancy three
names still unfamiliar to the provincial Occident. Ahmedi of Sives
(d. 1413), taking his cue from the Persian master Nizami, wrote an
Iskander-nama , or Book of Alexander , an immense epic in strong, crude
style, which gave not only the story of Alexander’s c onquest by Persia,
but as well the history, religion, science, and philosophy of the Near
East from the earliest times to Bajazet I. We must forgo quotation, for
the English version is such stuff as nightmares are made of. The poetry
of Ahmad Pasha (d. 1496) so delighted Mohammed II that the Sultan made
him vizier; the poet fell in love with a pretty page in the conqueror’s
retinue; Mohammed, having the same predilection, ordered the poet’s
death; Ahmad sent his master so melting a lyric that Mohammed gave him
the boy, but banished both to Brusa. 38 There Ahmad took into his home a
younger poet, soon destined to surpass him. Nejati (d. 1508), whose real
name was Isa (Jesus), wrote an ode in praise of Mohammed II, and
fastened it to the turban of the Sultan’s favorite partner in chess.
Mohammed’s curiosity fell for the lure; he read the scroll, sent for the
author, and made him an official of the royal palace. Bajazet II kept
him in favor and affluence, and Nejati, triumphing heroically over
prosperity, wrote in those two reigns some of the most lauded lyrics in
Ottoman literature.</p>
<p>Even so the great masters of Moslem poetry were still the Persians.
The court of Husein Baiqara at Herat so teemed with nightingales that
his vizier, Mir Ali Shir N awa’i, complained, “If you stretch out your
feet you kick the backside of a poet”; to which a bard replied, “And so
do you if you pull up yours.” 39 For Mir Ali Shir (d. 1501), besides
helping to rule Khurasan, supporting literature and art, and winning
renown as a miniaturist and a composer, was also a major poet — at once
the Maecenas and Horace of his time. It was his enlight- ened patronage
that gave aid and comfort to the painters Bihzad and Shah Muzaffar, and
the musicians Qul- Muhammad, Shayki Na’i, and Husein Udi, and the
supreme Moslem poet of the fifteenth century — Mulla Nuru’d -Din Abd-er-
Rahman Jami (d. 1492).</p>
<p>In a long and uneventful life Jami found time to achieve fame as a
scholar and mystic as well as a poet. As a Sufi he expounded in graceful
prose the old mystic theme, that the joyous union of the soul with the
Beloved — i.e., God — comes only when the soul realizes that self is a
delusion, and that the things of this world are a maya of transitory
phantoms melting in a mist of mortality. Most of Jami’s poetry is
mysticism in verse, spiced with some attractive sensuality. Salomon wa
Absal tells a pretty tale to point the superiority of divine to earthly
love. Salaman is the son of the shah of Yun (i.e., Ionia); born without
a mother (which is much more difficult than parthenogenesis), he is
brought up by the fair princess Absal, who becomes enamored of him when
he reaches fourteen. She conquers him with cosmetics:</p>
<p>The darkness of her eyes she darkened round</p>
<p>With surma, to benight him in midday,</p>
<p>And over them adorned and arched the bows</p>

<p>To wound him there when lost; her musky locks</p>
<p>Into so many snaky ringlets curled,</p>
<p>In which Temptation nestled o’er her cheek,</p>
<p>Whose rose she kindled with vermilion dew,</p>
<p>And then one subtle grain of musk laid there,</p>
<p>The bird of that beloved heart to snare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in passing, with a laugh would break</p>
<p>The pearl-enclosing ruby of her lips. . . .</p>
<p>Or, rising as in haste, her golden anklets</p>
<p>Clash, at whose sudden summons to bring down</p>
<p>Under her silver feet the golden crown 40</p>
<p>of the heir-apparent Prince. He yields without effort to these lures,
and for a time boy and lady enjoy a lyric love. The King reproaches the
youth for such dalliance, and bids him steel himself for war and
government. Instead Salaman elopes with Absal on a camel, “like sweet
twin almonds in a single shell.” Reach - ing the sea, they make a boat,
sail it “for a moon,” and come to a verdant isle rich in fragrant
flowers, singing birds, and fruit falling profusely at their feet. But
in this Eden conscience stabs the Prince with thoughts of the royal
tasks he has shunned. He persuades Absal to return with him to Yun; he
tries to train himself for kingship, but is so torn between duty and
beauty that at last, half mad, he joins Absal in suicide: they build a
pyre and leap hand in hand into its flames. Absal is consumed, but
Salaman emerges incombustible. Now, his soul cleansed, he inherits and
graces the throne — It is all an allegory, Jami explains: the King is
God, Salaman is the soul of man, Absal is sensual delight; the happy
isle is a Satanic Eden in which the soul is seduced from its divine
destiny; the pyre is the fire of life’s experience, in which sensual
desire is burned away; the</p>
<p>With an audacity redeemed by the result, Jami dared to rhyme again
the favorite themes of a dozen poets before him: Yusuf u Zulaikha , and
Laila njoa Majnun. In an eloquent exordium he restates the Sufi theory
of heavenly and earthly beauty:</p>
<p>In the Primal Solitude, while yet Existence gave no sign of
being,</p>
<p>and the universe lay hid in the negation of itself, Something was. .
. .</p>
<p>It was beauty absolute, showing Herself to Herself alone, and by Her
own light. As of a most beautiful lady in the bridal chamber of</p>
<p>mystery was Her robe, pure of all stain of imperfection. No
mirror</p>
<p>had Her face reflected, nor had the comb passed through Her tresses,
nor the breeze with balmy breath stirred even a single hair, nor any
nightingale come nestling to her Rose. . . . But beauty cannot bear to
be unknown; behold the Tulip on the mountain top, piercing the</p>
<p>rock with its shoot at the first smile of spring. … So Beauty
Eternal</p>
<p>came forth from the Holy Places of Mystery to beam on all
horizons</p>

and its Heavens; and so She was revealed in the mirror of created
things.</p>
<p>. . . And all atoms of the universe became as mirrors casting back

fell upon the rose, and the nightingale was crazed with helpless love.
Fire caught Her ardor, and a thousand moths came to perish in the
flame.</p>
<p>. . . And She it was who gave the Moon of Canaan that sweet bright-
ness which made Zulaikha mad . 41</p>
<p>From these celestial heights Jami descends to describe the Princess
Zulaikha’s loveliness with fervent repetition and detail, even to her
“chaste fortress and forbidden place.”</p>
<p>Her breasts were orbs of a light most pure,</p>
<p>Twin bubbles new-risen from fount Kafur,</p>
<p>Two young pomegranates grown on one spray,</p>

sees Joseph in the flesh, exposed in the market as a slave. She buys
him, tempts him, he refuses her ad- vances, she wastes away. The vizier
dies; Joseph displaces him and marries Zulaikha; soon both waste away,
at last to death. Only the love of God is truth and life. — It is an old
tale; but who could sleep over such sermons?</p>

<li>ART IN ASIATIC ISLAM</li>
</ol>
<p>Through all the reach of Islam, from Granada to Delhi and Samarkand,
kings and nobles used geniuses and slaves to raise mosques and
mausoleums, to paint and fire tiles, to weave and dye silks and rugs, to
beat metal and carve wood and ivory, to illuminate manuscripts with
liquid color and line. The Il-Khans, the Timurids, the Ottomans, the
Mamluks, even the petty dynas- ties that ruled the frailer fragments of
Islam, maintained the Oriental tradi- tion of tempering pillage with
poetry, and assassination with art. In rural villages and urban palaces
wealth graduated into beauty, and a fortunate few enjoyed the nearness
of things tempting to the touch or fair to see.</p>
<p>The mosque was still the collective shrine of Moslem arts. There
brick and tile composed the lyric of the minaret; portals of faience
broke into flashing colors the ardor of the sun; the pulpit displayed
the carved contours or inlaid intricacies of its wood; the splendor of
the mihrab pointed the worshiper to Mecca; grilles and chandeliers
offered their metal lacery as homage to Allah; rugs softened tiled
floors and cushioned praying knees; precious silks enveloped illuminated
Korans. At Tabriz Clavijo marveled at “beautiful mosques adorned with
tiles in blue and gold”; 43 and at Isfahan</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE GENIUS OF ISLAM 685</p>
<p>one of Uljaitu’s viziers set up in the Friday Mosque a mihrab in
which prosaic stucco became a lure of arabesques and lettering. Uljaitu
himself raised at Sultaniya a sumptuous mausoleum (1313), planning to
bring to it the remains of Ali and Husein, the founder saints of the
Shi‘a sect; the plan miscarried graciously, and the Khan’s own bones
were housed in this imposing ceno - taph. Immense and majestic are the
ruins of the mosque at Varamin (1326).</p>
<p>Timur loved to build, and stole architectural ideas, as well as
silver and gold, from the victims of his arms. Like a conqueror, he
favored mass, as symbolizing his empire and his will; like a nouveau
riche he loved color, and carried decoration to extravagance. Charmed by
the glazed blue tiles of Herat, he drew Persian potters to Samarkand to
face with gleaming slabs the mosques and palaces of his capital; soon
the city shone and sparkled with glorified clay. At Damascus he noted a
bulbous dome swelling out above the base and then tapering upward to a
point; he bade his engineers take its plan and measurements before it
fell in the general conflagration; he topped Samarkand with such domes,
and spread the style between India and Russia, so that it ranges now
from the Taj Mahal to the Red Square. When he re- turned from India he
brought back so many artists and artisans that they raised for him in
three months a gigantic mosque — the “Church of the King” — with a
portal 100 feet high and a ceiling upheld by 480 pillars of stone. For
his sister Tchouchouk Bika he built the funerary mosque that became the
architectural masterpiece of his reign. 44 When he ordered a mosque to
honor the memory of his chief wife, Bibi Khanun, he supervised the
construction himself, threw meat to the workers in the excavations and
coins to assiduous artisans, and inspired or compelled all to work con
furia until winter halted building and cooled his architectural
fire.</p>
<p>His descendants achieved a maturer art. At Mashhad, on the way from
Tehran to Samarkand, Shah Rukh’s enterprising wife, Gawhar Shad, en -
gaged the architect Qavam ad-Din to build the mosque that bears her name
(1418). It is the most gorgeous and colorful production of Moslem
Persian architecture. 45 Minarets carrying exquisite “lanterns” guard
the shrine. Four lordly arches lead into a central court, each faced
with faience tiles “never equaled before or since” 46 — a splendor of
time-defying color in a hundred forms of arabesque and geometrical
patterns and floral motives and stately Kufic script, all made more
brilliant by the Persian sun. Over the southwest “Portico of the
Sanctuary” a dome of blue tiles rivals the sky; and on the portal, in
large white letters on a blue ground, is the proud and pious dedica-
tion of the Queen:</p>
<p>Her Highness, the Noble in Greatness, the Sun of the Heaven of</p>
<p>Chastity and Continence . . . Gawhar Shad — may her greatness be</p>
<p>eternal, and may her chastity endure! . . . from her private
property,</p>

<p>XXXand for the benefit of her future state, and for the day on which

<p>pire! And may He increase on the inhabitants of the world His</p>
<p>Goodness, His Justice, and His Generosity! 47</p>
<p>The mosque of Gawhar Shad was but one of a complex of buildings that
made Mashhad the Rome of the Shi‘a sect. There the worshipers of Imam
Riza, in the course of thirty generations, have accumulated an
architectural ensemble of arresting splendor: graceful minarets,
dominating domes, arch- ways faced with luminous tiles or with plates of
silver or gold, spacious courts whose blue and white mosaic or faience
return the greeting of the sun: here, in an overwhelming panorama of
color and form, Persian art has wielded all its magic to honor a saint
and awe the pilgrim into piety.</p>
<p>From Azerbaijan to Afghanistan a thousand mosques rose in this age
out of the soil of Islam, for the poetry of faith is as precious to man
as the fruits of the earth. To us of the West, imprisoned in the
provinces of the mind, these shrines are but empty names, and even to
honor them with these curt obeisances may weary us. What does it mean to
us that Gawhar Shad re- ceived for her chaste bones a lovely mausoleum
at Herat; that Shiraz rebuilt its Masjid-i-Jami in the fourteenth
century; that Yazd and Isfahan added resplendent mihrabs to their Friday
Mosques? We are too far away in space and years and thought to feel
these grandeurs, and those who worship in them have little taste for our
Gothic audacities or the sensual images of our Renaissance. Yet even we
must be moved when, standing before the ruins of the Blue Mosque at
Tabriz (1437-67), we recall its once famed glory of blue faience and
golden arabesques; and we are not unmindful that Mohammed II and Bajazet
II raised at Constantinople (1463, 1497) mosques almost rivaling
St. Sophia’s majesty. The Ottomans took Byzantine plans, Persian
portals, Armenian domes, and Chinese decorative themes to form their
mosques at Brusa, Nicaea, Nicomedia, and Konia. In architecture, at
least, Moslem art was still in apogee.</p>
<p>Only one art — a David before Goliath — dared stand up to
architecture in Islam. Perhaps even more honored than the makers of
mosques were the masters of calligraphy and the patient miniaturists who
illuminated books with the infinitesimal calculus of the brush or pen.
Murals were painted, but from this period none survives. Portraits were
painted; and a few remain. The Ottomans publicly obeyed the Biblical and
Koranic prohibition of graven images, but Mohammed II imported Gentile
Bellini from Venice to Constantinople (1480) to make the likeness of him
that now hangs in the London National Gallery. Copies exist of alleged
portraits of Timur. In</p>
<p>THE GENIUS OF ISLAM</p>

<p>687</p>
<p>general the Mongol converts to Islam preferred the traditions of
Chinese art to the taboos of the Mohammedan faith. From China they
brought into Persian illumination dragons, phoenixes, cloud forms,
saintly halos, and moonlike faces, and mated them creatively with
Persian styles of limpid color and pure line. The mingling modes were
closely kin. Chinese and Persian miniaturists alike painted for
aristocrats of perhaps too refined a taste, and sought rather to please
the imagination and the sense than to represent objec- tive forms.</p>
<p>The great centers of Islamic illumination in this age were Tabriz,
Shiraz, and Herat. Probably from the Tabriz of the Il-Khans come the
fifty-five leaves of the “De Motte” Shah -nama — Firdausi’s Book of
Kings— painted by divers artists in the fourteenth century. But it was
at Herat, under the Ti- murid rulers, that Persian miniature painting
touched its zenith. Shah Rukh engaged a large staff of artists, and his
son Baisunkur Mirza founded an academy devoted to calligraphy and
illumination. From this school of Herat came the Shah-nama ( 1429) — a
miracle of glowing color and flowing grace- now so carefully hidden and
religiously handled in the Gulistan Palace Li- brary at Tehran. To view
it for the first time is like discovering the odes of Keats.</p>
<p>The real Keats of illumination — the “Raphael of the East”— was Kamal
al-Dim Bihzad. He knew in life, and reflected in art, the terrors and
vicissi- tudes of war. Born at Herat about 1440, he studied at Tabriz,
then returned to Herat to paint for Sultan Husein ibn-Baiqara and his
versatile vizier Mir Ali Shir Nawa’i. When Herat became the center of
Uzbeg and Safavid campaigns Bihzad moved again to Tabriz. He was among
the first Persian painters to sign their works, yet his art remains are
literally few and far be- tween. Two miniatures in the Royal Egyptian
Library at Cairo, illustrating Sa’di’s Bustan, show some theologians
debating their mysteries in a mosque; the manuscript bears the date
1489, and the colophon reads: “Painted by the slave, the sinner,
Bihzad.” The Freer Gallery in Washington has a Portrait of a Y oung Man
Painting, copied from Gentile Bellini and signed “Bihzad”; the fine
hands reveal the two artists — portrayer and portrayed. Less certainly
his are the miniatures in a British Museum copy of Nizami’s Khamza, and
in the same treasury a manuscript of a Z afar-nama, or Book of the
Victories of Timur.</p>
<p>These relics hardly explain Bihzad’s unrivaled reputation. They
reveal a sensitive perception of persons and things, an ardor and range
of color, a vivacity of action caught in a delicate accuracy of line;
but they can hardly compare with the miniatures painted for the Duke of
Berry almost a century before. Yet Bihzad’s contemporaries felt that he
had revolutionized illumi - nation by his original patterns of
composition, his vivid landscapes, his care- fully individualized
figures almost leaping into life. The Persian historian</p>
<p>688</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. A</p>
<p>XXKhwandamir, who was near fifty when Bihzad died (c. 1523), said of
him, perhaps with the prejudice of friendship: “His draughtsmanship has
caused the memory of all other painters in the world to be obliterated;
his fingers, endowed with miraculous qualities, have erased the pictures
of all other artists among the sons of Ad am.” 48 It should chasten our
certitudes to reflect that this was written after Leonardo had painted
The Last Supper, Michel- angelo the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and Raphael
the Stanze of the Vatican, and that Khwandamir had probably never heard
their names.</p>
<p>The art of the potter declined in this epoch from its finesse in
Seljuq Rayy and Kashan. Rayy had been laid in ruins by earthquakes and
Mongol raids, and Kashan devoted most of its kilns to tiles. New ceramic
centers, however, rose at Sultaniya, Yazd, Tabriz, Herat, Isfahan,
Shiraz, and Samarkand. Mosaic faience was now a favored product: small
slabs of earthenware, each painted in one metallic color, and glazed to
a brilliance that only needed care for permanence. When patrons were
opulent, Persian builders used such faience not only for mihrabs and
decoration, but even to cover large surfaces of mosque portals or walls;
there is an arresting example in a mihrab — from the mosque of Baba
Kasin (c. 1354) — in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>
<p>The metalworkers of Islam maintained their skill. They made bronze
doors and chandeliers for mosques from Bokhara to Marraqesh, though none
quite matched Ghiberti’s “gates to paradise” (1401 -52) in the
Baptistery of Florence. They forged the best armor of the age — helmets
conically shaped to deflect descending blows, shields of shining iron
encrusted with silver or gold, swords inlaid with golden lettering or
flowers. They made handsome coins, and such medallions as that which
preserves the pudgy profile of Mohammed the Conqueror, and great brass
candlesticks engraved with stately Kufic script or delicate floral
forms; they cast and adorned incense burners, writing cases, mirrors,
caskets, braziers, flasks, ewers, basins, trays; even scissors and
compasses were artistically chased. A like superiority was conceded to
the Moslem artist-artisans who cut gems, or worked with pre- cious
metals, or carved or inlaid ivory or wood. The textile remains are frag-
mentary, but the miniatures of the time picture a vast variety of
beautiful fabrics, from the fine linens of Cairo to the silken tents of
Samarkand; indeed it was the illuminators who designed the complex yet
logical patterns for Mongol and Timurid brocades, velvets, and silks,
and even for those Persian and Turkish rugs that were soon to be the
envy of Europe. In the so-called minor arts Islam still led the
world.</p>

<li>ISLAMIC THOUGHT</li>
</ol>
<p>In science and philosophy the glory had gone. Religion had won its
war against them, just when it was giving ground in the adolescent West.
The highest honors now went to theologians, dervishes, fakirs, saints;
and scientists aimed rather to absorb the findings of their predecessors
than to look nature freshly in the face. At Samarkand Moslem astronomy
had its last fling when the stargazers in the observatory of Uleg Beg
formulated (1437) astronomic tables that enjoyed high esteem in Europe
till the eighteenth century. Armed with tables and an Arab map, an Arab
navigator piloted Vasco da Gama from Africa to India on the historic
voyage that ended the economic ascendancy of Islam. 49</p>
<p>In geography the Moslems produced a major figure in this age. Bom at
Tangier in 1304, Muhammad Abu Abdallah ibn- Batuta wandered through
Daru’l -Islam — the Mohammedan world — for twenty-four years, and
returned to Morocco to die in Fez. His itinerary suggests the immense
spread of Mohammed’s creed: he claims to have traveled 75,000 miles
(more than any other man before the age of steam) ; to have seen
Granada, North Africa, Timbuktu, Egypt, the Near and Middle East,
Russia, India, Ceylon, and China, and to have visited every Moslem ruler
of the time. In each city he paid his respects first to the scholars and
divines, only then to the potentates. We see our own provincialism
mirrored in him when he lists “the seven mighty kings of the world,” all
Moslems except</p>
<p>Between 1250 and 1350 the most prolific writers on “natural history”
were Moslems. Mohammed ad-Damiri of Cairo wrote a 1,500-page book on
zoology. Medicine was still a Semitic forte; hospitals were numerous in
Islam; a physician of Damascus, Ala’al -din ibn-al-Nafis, expounded the
pulmonary circulation of the blood 270 years ( c . 1260) before
Servetus; 52 and a Granada physician, Ibn- al-Khatib, ascribed the Black
Death to contagion — and advised quarantine for the infected — in the
face of a theology that attributed it to divine vengeance on man’s sins.
His treatise On Plague ( c . 1360) contained a notable heresy: “It must
be a principle that a proof taken from the Traditions” of the companions
of Mohammed “has to undergo modification when in manifest contradiction
with the evidence of the senses.” 53</p>
<p>Scholars and historians were as numerous as poets. Always they wrote
in Arabic, the Esperanto of Islam; and in many cases they combined study
and writing with political activitv and administration. Abu-l-Fida of

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXpart in a dozen military campaigns, served al-Nasir as minister at
Cairo, returned to Syria as governor of Hamah, collected an extensive
library, and wrote some books that in their day stood at the head of
their class. His treatise on geography (Taqwin al-Buldan) outranged in
scope any European work of the kind and time; it calculated that three
quarters of the globe were covered with water, and noted that a traveler
gained or lost a day in going westward or eastward around the world. His
famous Abridgement of the History of the Human Race was the chief Moslem
history known to the West.</p>
<p>But the great name in the historiography of the fourteenth century is
Abd-er-Rahman ibn-Khaldun. Here is a man of substance, even to Western
eyes: solid with experience, travel, and practical statesmanship, yet
familiar with the art and literature, science and philosophy of his age,
and embracing almost every Moslem phase of it in a Universal History.
That such a man was born in Tunis (1332) and raised there suggests that
the culture of North Africa was no mere echo of Asiatic Islam, but had a
character and vitality of its own. “From my childhood,” says Ibn -
Khaldun’s autobiography, “I showed myself avid of knowledge, and devoted
myself with great zeal to schools and their courses of instruction.” The
Black Death took his parents and many teachers, but he continued his
studies until “I found at last that I knew something” ® 4 — a
characteristic delusion of youth. At twenty he was secretary to the
sultan at Tunis; at twenty-four, to the sultan at Fez; at twenty-five he
was in jail. He moved to Granada, and was sent as its ambas- sador to
Peter the Cruel at Seville. Returning to Africa, he became chief
minister to Prince Abu Abdallah at Bougie; but he had to flee for his
life when his master was deposed and slain. In 1370 he was sent by the
city of Tlemcen as envoy to Granada; he was arrested on the way by a
Moorish prince, served him four years, and then retired to a castle near
Oran. There (1377) he wrote the Muqaddama al-Alamat, literally
Introduction to the Universe. Needing more books than Oran could supply,
he returned to Tunis, but he made influential enemies there, and removed
to Cairo (1384). His fame as a scholar was already international; when
he lectured in the mosque of el-Azhar students crowded around him, and
Sultan Barquq gave him a pension, “as was his wont with savants.” 65 He
was appointed qadi malekite, or royal judge; took the laws too
seriously, closed the cabarets, was lampooned out of office, again
retired to private life. Restored as chief qadi, he accompanied Sultan
Nasir ad-Din Faraj in a campaign against Timur; the Egyptian forces were
defeated; Ibn-Khaldun sought refuge in Damascus; Timur besieged it; the
historian, now an old man, led a delegation to ask lenient terms of the
invincible Tatar. Like any other author, he brought a manuscript of his
history with him; he read to Timur the section on Timur, and invited
corrections; perhaps he had revised the pages ad hoc.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE GENIUS OF ISLAM 691</p>
<p>The plan worked; Timur freed him; soon he was once more chief judge
at Cairo; and he died in office at the age of seventy-four ( 1406).</p>
<p>Amid this hectic career he composed an epitome of Avenues’
philosophy, treatises on logic and mathematics, the Muqaddama , a
History of the Berbers , and The Peoples of the East . Only the last
three survive; together they con- stitute the Universal History. The
Muqaddama or Prolegomena is one of the high lights in Islamic literature
and in the philosophy of history, an amazingly “modem” product for a
medieval mind. Ibn -Khaldun conceives history as “an important branch of
philosophy,” 56 and takes a b road view of the historian’s task:</p>
<p>History has for its true object to make us understand the social</p>
<p>state of man, i.e., his civilization; to reveal to us the phenomena
that naturally accompany primitive life, and then the refinement of man-
ners . . . the diverse superiorities that peoples acquire, and which
beget empires and dynasties; the diverse occupations, professions,
sciences, and arts; and lastly all the changes that the nature of things
can effect in the nature of society. 57</p>
<p>Believing himself the first to write history in this fashion, he asks
pardon for inevitable errors:</p>
<p>I confess that of all men I am the least able to traverse so vast a
field.</p>
<p>… I pray that men of ability and learning will examine my work
with</p>
<p>good will, and when they find faults will indulgently correct
them.</p>
<p>That which I offer to the public will have little value in the eyes
of</p>
<p>scholars . . . but one should always be able to count on the courtesy
of his colleagues. 68</p>
<p>He hopes that his work will help in the dark days that he
foresees:</p>
<p>When the world experiences a complete overturn it seems to</p>
<p>change its nature in order to permit new creation and a new organiza-
tion. Hence there is need today of an historian who can describe the
state of the world, of its countries and peoples, and indicate the</p>
<p>changes in customs and beliefs. 59</p>
<p>He devotes some proud pages to pointing out the errors of some
historians. They lost themselves, he feels, in the mere chronicling of
events, and rarely rose to the elucidation of causes and effects. They
accepted fable almost as readily as fact, gave exaggerated statistics,
and explained too many things by supernatural agency. As for himself, he
proposes to rely entirely on natural factors in explaining events. He
will judge the statements of historians by the present experience of
mankind, and will reject any alleged occurrence that would now be
accounted impossible. Experience must judge tradition. 60 His own
method, in the Muqaddama , is first to deal with the philosophy of</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXX692</p>
<p>history; then with professions, occupations, and crafts; then with
the history of science and art. In succeeding volumes he gives the
political history of the various nations, taking them one by one,
deliberately sacrificing the unity of time to that of place. The true
subject of history, says Ibn-Khaldun, is civilization: how it arises,
how it is maintained, how it develops letters, sci- ences, and arts, and
why it decays . 61 Empires, like individuals, have a life and trajectory
which are their own. They grow, they mature, they decline . 82 What are
the causes of this sequence?</p>
<p>The basic conditions of the sequence are geographical. Climate
exercises a general but basic influence. The cold north eventually
produces, even in peoples of southern origin, a white skin, light hair,
blue eyes, and a serious disposition; the tropics produce in time a dark
skin, black hair, “dilatation of the animal spirits,” lightness of mind,
gaiety, quick transports of pleasure, leading to song and dance . 63
Food affects character: a heavy diet of meats, condiments, and grains
begets heaviness of body and mind, and quick suc- cumbing to famine or
infection; a light diet, such as desert peoples eat, makes for agile and
healthy bodies, clearness of mind, and resistance to disease . 64 There
is no inherent inequality of potential ability among the peoples of the
earth; their advancement or retardation is determined by geographical
con- ditions, and can be altered by a change in those conditions, or by
migration to a different habitat . 66</p>
<p>Economic conditions are only less powerful than the geographical.
Ibn- Khaldun divides all societies into nomad or sedentary according to
their means of getting food, and ascribes most wars to the desire for a
better food supply. Nomad tribes sooner or later conquer settled
communities because nomads are compelled by the conditions of their life
to maintain the martial qualities of courage, endurance, and solidarity.
Nomads may destroy a civili- zation, but they never make one; they are
absorbed, in blood and culture, by the conquered, and the nomad Arabs
are no exception. Since a people is never long content with its food
supply, war is natural. It is war that gener- ates and renews political
authority. Hence monarchy is the usual form of government, and has
prevailed through nearly all history . 66 The fiscal policy of a
government may make or break a society; excessive taxation, or the entry
of a government into production and distribution, can stifle incentive,
enterprise, and competition, and kill the goose that lays the revenues .
67 On the other hand, an excessive concentration of wealth may tear a
society to pieces by promoting revolution . 68</p>
<p>There are moral forces in history. Empires are sustained by the
solidarity of the people, and this can be best secured through the
inculcation and prac- tice of the same religion; Ibn-Khaldun agrees with
the popes, the Inquisition, and the Protestant Reformers on the value of
unanimity in faith.</p>
<p>THE GENIUS OF ISLAM</p>
<p>693</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX )</p>
<p>To conquer, one must rely upon the allegiance of a group animated</p>
<p>with one corporate spirit and end. Such a union of hearts and
wills</p>
<p>can operate only through divine power and religious support. . .
.</p>
<p>When men give their hearts and passions to a desire for worldly</p>
<p>goods, they become jealous of one another, and fall into discord. . .
.</p>
<p>If, however, they reject the world and its vanities for the love of
God . . . jealousies disappear, discord is stilled, men help one
another</p>
<p>devotedly; their union makes them stronger; the good cause makes
rapid progress, and culminates in the formation of a great and power-
ful empire. 89</p>
<p>Religion is not only an aid in war, it is likewise a boon to order in
a society and to peace of mind in the individual. These can be secured
only by a reli- gious faith adopted without questioning. The
philosophers concoct a hun- dred systems, but none has found a
substitute for religion as a guide and inspiration for human life.
“Since men can never understand the world, it is better to accept the
faith transmitted by an inspired legislator, who knows better than we do
what is better for us, and has prescribed for us what we should believe
and do.” 70 After this orthodox prelude our philosopher -his- torian
proceeds to a naturalistic interpretation of history.</p>
<p>Every empire passes through successive phases. ( 1 ) A victorious
nomad tribe settles down to enjoy its conquest of a terrain or state.
“The least civilized peoples make the most extensive conquests.” 71 (2)
As social rela - tions become more complex, a more concentrated
authority is required for the maintenance of order; the tribal chieftain
becomes king. (3) In this set- tled order wealth grows, cities multiply,
education and literature develop, the arts find patrons, science and
philosophy lift their heads. Advanced urbanization and comfortable
wealth mark the beginning of decay. (4) The enriched society comes to
prefer pleasure, luxury, and ease to enterprise, risk, or war; religion
loses its hold on human imagination or belief; morals deteriorate,
pederasty grows; the martial virtues and pursuits decline; mer- cenaries
are hired to defend the society; these lack the ardor of patriotism or
religious faith; the poorly defended wealth invites attack by the
hungry, seething millions beyond the frontiers. (5) External attack, or
internal in- trigue, or both together, overthrow the state. 72 Such was
the cycle of Rome, of the Almoravids and Almohads in Spain, of Islam in
Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Persia; and “it is always so.” 78</p>
<p>These are a few of the thousands of ideas that make the Muqaddama the
most remarkable philosophical product of its century. Ibn-Khaldun has
his own notions on almost everything but theology, where he thinks it
unwise to be original. While writing a major work of philosophy he
pronounces philosophy dangerous, and advises his readers to let it
alone; 74 probably he meant metaphysics and theology rather than
philosophy in its wider sense</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>694</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXas an attempt to see human affairs in a large perspective. At
times he talks like the simplest old woman in the market place; he
accepts miracles, magic, the “evil eye,” the occult properties of the
alphabet, divination through dreams, entrails, or the flight of birds.
75 Yet he admires science, admits the superiority of the Greeks to the
Moslems in that field, and mourns the decline of scientific studies in
Islam. 76 He rejects alchemy, but acknowledges some faith in astrology.
77</p>
<p>Certain other discounts must be made. Though Ibn-Khaldun is as broad
as Islam, he shares many of its limitations. In the three volumes of the
Muqad- dama he finds room for but seven pages on Christianity. He makes
only casual mention of Greece, Rome, and medieval Europe. When he has
writ- ten the history of North Africa, Moslem Egypt, and the Near and
Middle East, he believes that he has narrated “the history of all
peoples.” 78 Some - times he is culpably ignorant: he thinks Aristotle
taught from a porch, and Socrates from a tub. 79 His actual writing of
history falls far short of his theo- retical introduction; the volumes
on the Berbers and the Orient are a dreary record of dynastic
genealogies, palace intrigues, and petty wars. Apparently he intended
these volumes to be political history only, and offered the Muqaddama as
a history — though it is rather a general consideration — of
culture.</p>
<p>To recover our respect for Ibn-Khaldun we need only ask what
Christian work of philosophy in the fourteenth century can stand beside
the Prole- gomena. Perhaps some ancient authors had covered part of the
ground that he charted; and among his own people al-Masudi (d. 9 56), in
a work now lost, had discussed the influence of religion, economics,
morals, and environ- ment on the character and laws of a people, and the
causes of political de- cline. 80 Ibn-Khaldun, however, felt, and with
some reason, that he had created the science of sociology. Nowhere in
literature before the eighteenth century can we find a philosophy of
history, or a system of sociology, com- parable in power, scope, and
keen analysis with Ibn- Khaldun’s. Our leading contemporary philosopher
of history has judged the Muqaddama to be “un - doubtedly the greatest
work of its kind that has ever yet been created by any mind in any time
or place.” 81 Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology (1876-96) may
compare favorably with it, but Spencer had many aides. In any case we
may agree with a distinguished historian of science, that “the most
important historical work of the Middle Ages” 82 was the Muqaddama of
Ibn-Khaldun.</p>
