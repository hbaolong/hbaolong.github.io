<p>XXDiderot Proteus</p>
<p>•758 -73</p>
<p>I. THE PANTHEIST</p>
<p>W E call him Proteus because, like the sea god in Homer, he
“tried</p>
<p>to escape his captor s by assuming all sorts of shapes.” 1
Voltaire</p>
<p>called him Pantophilus because Diderot was in love with every branch
of science, literature, philosophy, and art. In each of these fields he
had in- timate knowledge; to each he made suggestive contributions.
Ideas were his meat and drink. He gathered them, savored and sampled
them, and poured them out in a profuse chaos whenever he found a blank
sheet or a willing ear. “I throw my ideas upon paper, and they become
what they may” 2 — perhaps foes. He never co-ordinated them, never
bothered with consistency; we can quote him in almost any direction, but
his composite direction was unmistakable. He was more original than
Voltaire, perhaps because he had never accepted classic norms, and could
let himself go without well-bred restraints. He followed every theory
wherever it led him, sometimes to its depths, sometimes to its dregs. He
saw every point of view except those of the priest and the saint,
because he had no cer- tainties.</p>
<p>As for me, 1 concern myself more with forming than with dissipa-</p>
<p>ting clouds, with suspending judgment rather than with judging. . .
.</p>
<p>I do not decide, I ask questions. 3 … I let my mind rove
wantonly,</p>
<p>give it free rein to follow any idea, wise or mad, that may come
upper- most; I chase it as do young libertines on the track of a
courtesan</p>
<p>whose face is windblown and smiling, whose eyes sparkle, and whose
nose turns up. . . . My ideas are my trollops. 4</p>
<p>Diderot had an intellectual imagination; he visioned ideas,
philosophies, personalities, as others vision forms and scenes. Who else
in his time could have conceived the scandalous, unmoral, shiftless,
fascinating “nephew of Rameau”? After creating a charact er, he let it
develop as of its own ac- cord; he let it lead him on as if the
character were the author, and the author the puppet. He imagined
himself in the place of a young unwilling</p>

<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>651</p>
<p>nun, and made her so real that skeptical Frenchmen worried over her
woes. He experimented mentally with ideas, entertained them for a time,
imagined their consequences in logic or action, then tossed them aside.
There was hardly an idea of that time that did not enter his head. He
was not only and literally a walking encyclopedia, he was a moving
laboratory, and his ideas wandered with his feet.</p>
<p>So in Pensees sur /’ interpretation de la nature, which he published
in 1754 — anonymously, but with permission tacite from the benevolent
Males- herbes — he played with ideas of monism, materialism, mechanism,
vitalism, and evolution. Still under Bacon’s spell, he took from him the
title, the aphoristic form, and the summons to scientists to labor in
concert for the conquest of nature through experiment and reason. He was
inspired, too, by Maupertuis’ Systeme universel de la nature (1751), and
Buffon’s His - toire naturelle (1749 f.); he agreed with Maupertuis that
all matter might be alive, and with Buffon that biology was now ready to
speak to philos- ophy. He welcomed in both authors the emerging
hypothesis of evolution.</p>
<p>He began with a proud design: “It is nature that I wish to
describe</p>
<ul>
<li>ecrire〕 ; nature is the only book for the philosopher.” 3 He
conceived of nature as a half-blind, half-intelligent power operating
upon matter, mak- ing matter live, making life take a million
experimental forms, improv- ing this organ, discarding that one, giving
birth and death creatively. In that cosmic laboratory thousands of
species have appeared and disappeared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as in the animal and plant kingdoms an individual begins, . .
.</p>
<p>grows, endures, perishes, and passes away, could it not be likewise
with entire species? If faith did not teach us that animals come from
the</p>
<p>hands of the Creator such as we see them, and if it were allowed
to</p>
<p>have the least doubt of their commencement and their end, might not
the philosopher, abandoned to his conjectures, suppose that animality
had from all eternity its particular elements, scattered and confounded
in the mass of matter; that these elements happened to unite, since it
was possible for this to happen; that the embryo formed from these
elements passed through an infinity of organizations and developments;
that it acquired in succession movement, sensation, ideas, thought, re-
flection, consciousness, feelings, passions, signs, gestures, articulate
sounds, language, laws, sciences, and arts; that millions of years
passed between these developments; that perhaps it 〔the organism〕 has
still further developments to undergo, other additions to receive,
now</p>
<p>unknown to us; . . . that it may lose these faculties as it
acquired</p>
<p>them; that it may forever disappear from nature, or, rather, continue
to exist under a form, and with faculties, quite other than those which
we notice in it in this moment of time? 0</p>
<p>Nature in Diderot is everything; she is his God; but of her essence
we know only her confused abundance and restless change. Nature is
matter</p>
<p>652</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXalive. Everything is matter, but matter contains in itself the elan
of life and the potentiality of thought. Man is not a machine, but
neither is he an immaterial spirit; body and soul are one organism, and
die together. “Everything destroys itself and perishes; nothing remains
but the world; nothing endures but time.” 7 Nature is neutral: she makes
no distinction between good and evil, great and small, sinner and saint.
She cares for the species rather than for the individual; let the
individual mature and repro- duce, then let him die; and every species
too will die. Nature is wise in a myriad subtle details, which seem to
show design; she gives organisms instincts that enable them to live and
make live; but also she is blind, de- stroying philosophers and fools
alike with one belch of fire, one heave of her shoulders through the
crust of the earth. We shall never be able to understand Nature, or to
ferret out her purpose or meaning, if she have any; for we ourselves, in
all our bloody and majestic history, are among her transient and
infinitesimal sports.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE DREAM OF D’ALEMBERT</li>
</ol>
<p>Diderot continued his speculations on nature in one of the strangest
pro- ductions in French literature — Le Reve d’Alembert. It was
characteristic of him to present his thoughts in the form of a dream, to
foist the dream upon his friend, and to make two famous contemporaries —
Julie de Les- pinasse and Dr. Theophile de Bordeu — the speakers in the
dialogue. “I put my ideas into the mouth of a man who dreams,” Diderot
told his mistress; “it is often necessary to give wisdom the air of
foolishness in order to procure it entry.” 8 Under th ese disguises he
let his philosophical imagination run wild, careless of personal peril
and social effects. He was quite pleased with the result; he described
it to Sophie Volland as “the maddest and deepest thing ever written;
there are five or six pages that will make your sister’s hair stand on
end”;“ yet he assured her that it con - tained “not a single improper
word.” 10 He wrote it in 1769, read parts of it to friends, and thought
of having it printed — presumably abroad and un- signed; but A^lle. de
Lespinasse protested, for reasons that will soon be obvious. In a heroic
gesture he threw the manuscript into the fire, probably knowing that
there was another copy; in any case, the work was printed in 1830.</p>
<p>It is a tripartite affair. In the pre liminary “conversation”
(“Entretien</p>
<p>entre d’Alembert et Diderot”) the mathematician objects to his
friend’s vitalistic materialism as no more acceptable than the
Schoolmen’s concep - tion of God. “Between you and the animal,” Diderot
tells him, “there is no difference but one of organism” (degree of
organic development), and</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>653</p>
<p>likewise between animal and plant; consequently everything in man
must have its seed or its analogy in plants. And in matter too? asks
d’Alembert. Yes, Diderot replies; for “how do you know that feeling is
essentially in - compatible with matter — you who do not know the
essence of anything, neither of matter nor of feeling? . . . There is
not more than one sub- stance in the universe, in man, in animals.”
11</p>
<p>The second part of the trilogy shows Dr. Bordeu and Allle. de
Lespi-</p>
<p>nasse at the bedside of d’Alembert, who is asleep after his
argumentative</p>
<p>Why am I what I am? Because it was inevitable that I should be.</p>
<p>… If everything is a general flux, . . . what will not be
produced</p>
<p>here or elsewhere bv the passing and vicissitudes of some millions of
centuries? Who can tell what the thinking and feeling being is on</p>
<p>Saturn? . . . Might the feeling and thinking being on Saturn have</p>
<p>more senses than we? Ah, if so, the Saturnian is unfortunate,
〔for〕</p>
<p>the more the senses, the more the needs . 14</p>
<p>“He is right,” Bordeu comments Lamarckianly; “organs produce needs,
and, reciprocally, needs produce organs.”</p>
<p>D’Alembert wakes for a moment, finds Bordeu kissing Lcspinasse, pro -
mere forget him, and pursue the train of ideas started by the dream.
Bordeu notes the birth of human freaks, and challenges the believers in
divine design to explain them. Mademoiselle has a bright apcrqn:
“Perhaps man is only the freak of a woman, or woman of a man.” ir ’ The
doctor enlarges on this Diderotically: “The only difference between them
is that one has a bag hanging outside, and the other has it tucked away
inside.” D’Alembert wakes and protests, “1 th ink you are talking filth
to Made- moiselle de Lcspinasse.” Bordeu rises to keep an appointment
with another</p>
<p>654</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXpatient; d’Alembert begs him to stay long enough to explain: “How
comes it that I have remained myself to myself and to others through all
the vicissitudes I have undergone in the course of my life, and when
perhaps I possess no longer a single one of the molecules I brought with
me</p>
<p>at birth?” The doctor replies, “Memory, and . . . the slowness of t
he changes”; and Mademoiselle offers a striking analogy: “The spirit of
a monastery is conserved because the monastery repeoples itself bit by
bit, and when a new monk enters he finds a hundred old ones who lead him
on to’think and feel like them.” 16</p>
<p>Bordeu thenceforth dominates the discussion. He differentiates “roman
- tic” from “classic” genius as the senses dominating, or being
dominated by, conscious mind. He thinks Lespinasse an obvious example of
the first, and blandly informs her, “You will divide your time between
laughter and tears, and never be more than a child.” He gives a
physiological explana - tion of dreams:</p>
<p>Sleep is a state in which there is no more ensemble 〔no more
co-ordi- nation of the senses by consciousness or purpose〕. All
concerted</p>
<p>action, all discipline, ceases. The master 〔the conscious self〕 is
aban- doned to the discretion of his vassals 〔the senses〕. … Is the
optic</p>
<p>thread 〔nerves〕 agitated? Then the origin of the network 〔the
brain〕 sees. If the auditory thread demands, it hears. Action and
reaction</p>
<ul>
<li>sensation and response〕 are the only things which subsist between
them. This is consequent on . . . the law of continuity and habit.
If</li>
</ul>
<p>the action begins by the voluptuous end which nature has destined</p>
<p>for the pleasure of love and the propagation of the species, the
effect … on the origin of the bundle will be to reveal the image of
the</p>
<p>beloved. If this image, on the other hand, is first of all revealed
to the origin of the bundle, the tension of the voluptuous end, the
effer-</p>
<p>vescence and effusion of the seminal fluid, will be the effect of
the</p>
<p>reaction. … In the waking state the network obeys the impressions</p>
<p>made by an external object. Asleep, it is from the exercise of its
own feeling that everything passing within itself emanates. There is
nothing to distract in a dream; hence its vivacity. 17</p>
<p>Perhaps feeling that the patient he had intended to visit would be
more readily cured by nature than by medicine, Bordeu forgets him, and
pro- ceeds to expound determinism, and to describe “self -respect,
shame, and remorse” as “puerilities founded on the ignorance and vanity
of a person who imputes to himself the merit and demerit of an
inevitable instant.” 18</p>
<p>Diderot became so enamored of Bordeu as his mouthpiece that in Part
III, “Suite de 1’entretien” (Continuation of the Conversation) he
left</p>
<p>d’Alembert out altogether. So freed, the doctor denounces chastity as
un - natural, and approves of onanism as the necessary relief of
congested vesi-</p>

<p>cles. “Nature tolerates nothing useless. And then can I be
blameworthy in helping her when she calls for my aid by the least
equivocal of symptoms? Let us never provoke her, b ut occasionally lend
her a hand.” 19 The doctor ends by recommending experiments in the
reproductive mingling of dif- ferent species, possibly producing thereby
a type of man-animal that might contentedly act as servant to man.
Mademoiselle, anticipating Anatole France and the penguins, wonders,
should these half-men be baptized?</p>
<p>bordeu (about to leave). Have you seen in the zoological gardens, in
a glass cage, an orangutan with the look of St. John preaching in
the</p>
<p>desert?</p>
<p>mademoiselle. Yes, I have.</p>
<p>bordeu (going). The Cardinal de Polignac said to it one day,
“Speak,</p>
<p>and I baptize thee.” 20</p>
<p>In Elements de physiologie (c. 1774) Diderot rounded out his theory
of evolution with some musing on the “missing link”:</p>
<p>It is necessary to begin by classifying beings, from the inert
molecule (if there is one) to the active molecule, to the microscopic
animal, to the . . . plant, to the animal, to man. . . . One mustn’t
believe the</p>
<p>chain of being to be interrupted by the diversity of forms; the
form</p>
<p>is only a mask which deceives, and a missing link exists perhaps in
an unknown being which the progress of comparative anatomy has not yet
been able to assign to its true place. 21</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>DIDEROT ON CHRISTIANITY</li>
</ol>
<p>He had promised Sophie Volland that there would be nothing in The
Dream of cT Alembert about religion; actually, of course, the trilogy
ex- pressed a philosophy that quite dispensed with deity. Publicly he
remained a deist, keeping God as Prime Mover only, and denying
providence, or divine design. Theoretically he was an agnostic,
disclaiming any knowledge of, or interest in, anything beyond the world
of the senses and the sciences. Sometimes he spoke vaguely of a cosmic
consciousness, which stumbled along through endless time, making
experiments, producing now sterile freaks or lucky accidents — hardly a
God to receive a prayer. In another mood he could become violently
antagonistic. He told of the misanthrope who, in revenge upon life,
propagated the idea of God; the idea spread, and soon “men fell to
quarreling, hating, and cutting one another’s throats; and they have
been doing the same thing ever since that abominable name was
pronounced.” And Diderot added, in cautious ecstasy, “I would sacri
-</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXfice my life, perhaps, if I could annihilate forever the notion of
God.” 22 Yet the same muddleheaded genius felt the amazing order and
grandeur of the cosmos; he wrote to Mile. Volland: “Atheism is close to
being a kind of superstition, as puerile as the other”; and he added: “I
am mad - dened at being entangled in a devilish philosophy that my mind
cannot help approving and my heart refuting.” 23 In his later years he
admitted the difficulty of deriving the organic from the inorganic, or
thought from sensation. 24</p>
<p>But he never relented in his war on Christianity. A passionate
paragraph in a private letter sums up his case against it:</p>
<p>The Christian religion is to my mind the most absurd and
atrocious</p>
<p>in its dogmas: the most unintelligible, the most metaphysical, the
most entangled and obscure, and consequently the most subject to
divisions, sects, schisms, heresies; the most mischievous for the public
tranquil- lity, the most dangerous to sovereigns by its hierarchic
order, its</p>
<p>persecutions, its discipline; the most flat, the most dreary, the
most Gothic and most gloomy in its ceremonies; the most puerile and un-
sociable in its morality; . . . the most intolerant of all. 25</p>
<p>In Promenade du sceptique (1747) he had acknowledged the services of
the Church in training character and forming morals; in later years he
thought that while discouraging petty crime the Christian religion had
fomented greater ones: “Sooner or later a moment comes when the notion
which had prevented a man from stealing a shilling will cause 100,000
men to be slaughtered. Fine compensation!” 26 However, “our religious
opinions have little influence on ou r morals”; 27 men fear present laws
more than a distant hell and an invisible God. Even a priest “hardly
relies upon praying to the gods except when he is little concerned about
the matter.” 28 In 1783 Diderot predicted that belief in God, and
submission to kings, would be everywhere at an end within a few years;
29 the prediction seemed verified in France in 1792; but Diderot also
predicted that “the belief in the existence of God will remain forever.”
30</p>
<p>Like most of those who have lost their faith in Catholic doctrine,
this same Diderot who thought Christian ceremonies dreary and gloomy re-
mained sensitive to the beauty and solemnity of Catholic ritual, and he
de- fended it against Protestant critics in his Salon of 1165 :</p>
<p>Those absurd rigorists do not know the effect of outward cere-</p>
<p>monies upon the people. Thev have never seen our Adoration of the
Cross on Good Friday, the enthusiasm of the multitude at the proces-
sion of Corpus Christi, an enthusiasm bv which I am sometimes carried
away. I have never seen that long file of priests in sacerdotal

<p>ments, those young acolytes in white albs, . . . strewing flowers
be-</p>
<p>fore the Holy Sacrament, that crowd preceding and following them in
religious silence, so many men prostrate on the ground, I have never
heard that grave, pathetic chant sung by the priests and affectionately
answered by numberless men, women, girls, and children, without</p>
<p>being stirred in my inmost heart, and without tears coming into
my</p>
<p>eyes. 31</p>
<p>But after wiping his eyes he resumed the attack. In the Entretien
(Tun philosophe avec la marechale de — (1776), he imagined a skeptic,
whom he named Crudeli (Italian for cruel), talking with a titled lady
who “held that the man who denies the Blessed Trinity is a ruffian who
will end on the gallows.” She is surprised to find that M. Crudeli, who
is an atheist, is not also a sensualist and a thief. “I think that if I
had nothing to fear or hope after death I should allow myself a good
many little pleasures here below.” Crudeli asks, “What are those
things?” “They are only for my confessor’s ears. . . . But what motive
can an unbeliever hav e for being good, unless he is mad?” She retreats
a little before his arguments, then takes a new line of defense: “We
must have something with which to frighten off those actions which
escape the severity of the laws.” And be - sides, “if you destroy
religion, what will you put in its place?” Crudeli answers, “Suppose I
had nothing to put in its place, there would always be one terrible
prejudice less.” He pictures Mohammedans on a Christian - killing
rampage, and Christians burning Mohammedans and Jews.</p>
<p>marechale. Suppose everything that you believe false should be true,
and you were damned. It is a terrible thing to be damned — to</p>
<p>burn through eternity.</p>
<p>crudeli. La Fontaine thought we should be as comfortable as fishes in
water.</p>
<p>marechale. Yes, yes, but your La Fontaine became very serious at</p>
<p>the end, and I expect the same of you.</p>
<p>crudeli. I can answer for nothing when my brain has softened.</p>
<p>The most anticlerical of the philosophes kept a special bitterness
for what seemed to him the waste of human seed and energy in monasteries
and nunneries. One of his angriest pages excoriated parents who con-
demned unwilling daughters to convent life; and his technically most
fin- ished production is an imaginary re-creat ion of such a nun’s
career. La Religieuse ( The Nun) was written in 1760 as the result of a
prank by which Grimm and Diderot hoped to bring back to their company
the Marquis de Croixmare from Caen to Paris. About this time Diderot was
aroused by a nun’ s appeal to the Parlement of Paris to release her from
the vows that (she claimed) her parents had constrained her to take.
The</p>
<p>658</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXkindly Marquis wrote to the Parlement in her behalf, but in vain.
We know nothing more of this nun, but Diderot reconstructed her history
with such realistic fancy that she will live for centuries. He supposed
that she had escaped from her convent, and he sent to Croixmare, as if
from her pen, a series of letters describing her conventual experiences
and asking his help in beginning a new life. The Marquis answered;
Diderot replied in her name; and this correspondence continued through
four months and 150 pages.</p>
<p>Diderot pictured Suzanne persecuted by a harsh abbess, imprisoned,
stripped, tortured, starved. She complains to a priest, who secures her
transfer to another convent; there, however, the abbess is a Lesbian who
overwhelms her with love and solicits her co-operation. Diderot probably
exaggerated the cruelties of abbesses and the griefs of nuns, but he
made all the priests in his story amiable and benevolent, and he treated
the Les- bian theme with a delicacy rare in his works. The Marquis was
moved, and came to Paris. The hoax was revealed to him; he forgave it.
The strange device had produced a remarkable study in psychology,
perhaps influenced by Richardson’s Clarissa ; never had a skeptic
entered so vividly into the feelings of a reluctant saint. A visitor who
came upon the author during the composition of these letters found him,
says Grimm, “plunged in grief . . . and tears.” 32 Diderot confessed
that he was weeping over his own tale, for tears came to him as readily
as to Rousseau. He was for- givably proud of his epistolary novel, of
its verisimilitude, sentiment, and style; he revised it carefully, and
bequeathed it for publication after his death. It saw the light in 1796,
under the Revolution. In 1865 La Re- ligieuse was publicly burned by
order of the Tribunal of the Seine. 33</p>
<p>Published with it in 1796, burned with it in 1865, was Jacques le
fataliste et son maitre, which Diderot, with the pathos of nearness,
considered his greatest work. 34 It may be so, but it is also the most
absurd. Infatuated with T ristram Shandy ( 1 760- 67 ) , he adopted
Sterne’s trick of composing a story largely of interruptions, intruding
upon it whimsically now and then to talk to the reader about the
characters and the plot. He began and ended the book with passages and
incidents copied directly from Sterne, 35 and he bettered Sterne’s
example of startling the reader with an occasional in - decency. The two
characters that carry the story reflect Cervantes’ device of contrasting
master and man in temperament and philosophy. The mas- ter rejects,
Jacques professes, fatalism; “Everything . . . that happens down here,”
he says, “is written up yonder.” 30 Jacques “believed that a man wended
his way just as necessarily to glory or ignominy as a ball . . . would
follow the slope of the mountain” down which it rolled. “His</p>
<ul>
<li>former〕 captain had filled Jacques’ head with all these ideas
drained out of Spinoza, whom he knew by heart” 37 — a rare captain.</li>

<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>659</p>
<p>Midway in the story Diderot tarries to tell, with verve and skill,
the</p>
<p>story of the Marquise de la Pommeraye, mistress of the Marquis des
Arcis. Suspecting that he has tired of her, she resolves to find out by
hinting that their liaison has become a bore. She is deeply offended by
his admission that he is willing to relapse from a lover into a friend.
She plans a unique revenge. She finds a pretty prostitute, finances her
rehabilitation, teaches her grammar, manners, and an impressive piety,
introduces her to the Mar- quis as a lady of lineage, trains her to
arouse his humors and reject his advances, guides her in the art of
eliciting a proposal of marriage. Some months after the marriage Mme. de
la Pommeraye reveals to the Marquis the past of his mate. But the
Marquise’s revenge is spoiled by an anomalous development. The reformed
sinner has learned to love her Marquis; in shame and tears she confesses
her deception, and proposes to disappear from his life. Meanwhile she
has been so faithful and affectionate a wife that the Marquis has
discovered more happiness in marriage than ever in adultery. He forgives
her, and refuses to let her go; he lives with her in brave content, and
Mme. de la Pommeraye eats her heart out in defeat.</p>
<p>This intermezzo is by all means the most striking part of Jacques
le</p>
<p>fataliste; it has the close texture, the subtle touches of
psychological real- ism, the concentrated feeling quietly expressed,
which are missing in the novel as a whole. Schiller recognized it as a
gem of literary art, and trans- lated it into German in 1785.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE NEPHEW OF RAMEAU</li>
</ol>
<p>Le Neveu de Rameau, and not Jacques le fataliste, is Diderot’s
greatest single book — “the classical work,” Goethe called it, “of an
outstanding man.” 38 Written in 1761, this too was left unpublished, for
it is by all means the most scandalous, as well as the most original, of
Diderot’s pro - ductions. Apparently he thought it too indigestible to
be offered even to his friends. After his death a copy of the text found
its way into a Ger- many throbbing with Sturm und Drang. Schiller was
shocked and excited by it, and passed it on to Goethe, who, at the
height of his fame (1805), translated it into German. This translation
entered France, and was retrans- lated into French (1821). Another copy
was published in 1823, but it had come to the printer bowdlerized by
Diderot’s daughter. The original manu - script was not discovered till
1891, in a bookstall on the quays of the Seine. That manuscript is now
in the J. Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.</p>
<p>Diderot chose, as the mouthpiece of ideas too bizarre for even
Diderot to express in the first person, Jean Frangois Rameau, nephew of
the famous composer Jean Philippe Rameau (d. 1764), who was still alive
when the</p>
<p>66 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXunpublishable dialogue was written. Diderot knew music well; he
talked familiarly of Locatelli, Pergolesi, Jommelli, Galuppi, Leo,
Vinci, Tartini, and Hasse, and rightly predicted that in violin playing
the difficult would soon displace the beautiful . 39</p>
<p>The nephew composed music, and had some success as a music teacher;
but he was harassed by the handicap of his name, and jealous of his
uncle’s superiority; he gave up the battle, and sank into the Bohemian
shiftlessness and self-indulgent amoralism described by Diderot. Many
other traits at- tributed to him in the dialogue are confirmed by
contemporary reports , 40 but history gives no support to Diderot’s
characterization of him as a pander who proposed to market the beauty of
his wife. When that wife died Jean Francois lost all self-respect; his
sarcastic and unchastened tongue made him a social outcast; at last he
was excluded from the home of the rich M. Bertin, on whom he had for
years depended for his dinners; and he had to seek associates in the
Cafe de la Regence and other outposts of advanced and penniless
ideas.</p>
<p>Diderot begins (note how he weaves his books into his life):</p>
<p>Let the weather be fair or overcast, it is my habit, about five
o’clock in the afternoon, to go walking toward the Palais-Royal. It is I
whom you can see always alone, dreaming on d’Argenson’s bench. I discuss
with myself politics, love, taste, philosophy. I abandon my mind to all
its libertinage. . . . When the weather is too cold or w et I take
refuge in the Cafe de la Regence, where I watch the chess games. . . .
One</p>
<p>afternoon I was there, looking around, talking little, hearing as
little as I could, when I was approached by one of the most bizarre
persons in the land . 41</p>
<p>There follows a remarkable character portait: a man who has drunk the
dregs of life and bitterly recalls the wine; formerly moneyed and
comfort- able, with the prettiest wife in Paris; received once in every
fashionable home ; 42 abreast of all the culture in France; sunk now
into poverty and degradation, living on merciful dinners and forgotten
loans, seeing nothing in fife but struggle and defeat, rejecting all
religion as a beautiful and terrible lie, viewing all morality as
timidity and sham, and yet keeping enough of his past to clothe his
disillusionment in educated eloquence and rational dress. He has a sharp
and bitter humor: “Madame So -and-So has been delivered of twins; each
father will have one”; or, of a new opera: “It has some pretty passages;
too bad this is not the first tim e they have been composed .” 43 His
deepest tragedy is that he believes in nothing. He has heard Rousseauian
mouthings about nature — how much better it is than civilization; but he
observes that “in nature all species devour one an - other,” and the sub
lime end of every organism is to be eaten. He sees the</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) DIDEROT PROTEUS 66 1</p>
<p>same anthropophagy in the economic world, except that there men con-
sume one another by due process of law. All morality, he thinks, is a
hoax that the clever play upon the simple, or that the simple play upon
them- selves. See that pious woman coming from church with modest
downcast eyes; “her imagination at night rehearses the scenes of the
〔licentious〕 Fortier des Chartrains and the 〔libidinous〕 postures of
Aretino .” 44 The wise man, thinks the nephew, will laugh at the Ten
Commandments, and enjoy all the sins judiciously. “Hurrah for wisdom and
philosophy!— the wisdom of Solomon: to drink good wines, gorge on choice
foods, tumble pretty women, sleep on downy beds; outside of that, all is
vanity .” 45 After this, what was left for the Nietzsches and
Baudelaires to say?</p>
<p>Diderot ends this danse macabre of ideas by calling the nephew “a do
- nothing, a glutton, a coward, a spirit of mud”— to which Rameau
replies, “I believe you are right .” 40 A mean thought comes to us: How
could Diderot have drawn this character so vividly if he had not found
him lurk- ing in himself? He protests against the idea. He admits that
he is no saint.</p>
<p>I do not condemn the pleasure of the senses. I too have a palate</p>
<p>that relishes delicate dishes and delicious wines. I have a heart
and</p>
<p>eyes, and I like to see a beautiful w oman, I like to feel under
my</p>
<p>hand the firmness and roundness of her throat 〔gorge〕, to press her
lips to mine, to draw’ pleasure from her eyes, and to expire in her
arms. Sometimes, with my friends, a little debauch, even a bit
tumultuous, does not displease me. But — I will not conceal it from you
— it seems to me infinitely sweeter to have helped the unfortunate, … to
have</p>
<p>given salutary counsel, to have read an agreeable book, to take a
walk with a man or a woman dear to me, to have given some
instructive</p>
<p>hours to my children, to have written a good page, to fulfill the</p>
<p>duties of my place, to sav to my beloved tender and sw eet w’ords
that bring her arms around my neck. . . .</p>
<p>A man of my acquaintance grew to wealth in Cartagena; he was a</p>
<p>younger son in a country where custom transmits all property to the
eldest. Word reached him in Colombia that his older brother, a spoiled
brat, had despoiled his too indulgent father and mother of all that they
possessed, and had expelled them from their chateau; and that these good
people were now languishing in poverty in a provincial town.</p>
<p>What did this younger son do, w r ho, so badlv treated by his
parents, had gone so far abroad to seek his fortune? He sent them help,
he</p>
<p>hastened to arrange his affairs and return, opulent, to his father
and mother; he restored them to their home, he provided dowries to get
his sisters married. Ah, my dear Rameau, this man regards those months
as the happiest in his life. He spoke of them to me with tears in his
eyes.</p>
<p>And I, in telling you his story, I feel my heart troubled with joy,
with</p>
<p>a pleasure that can find no words . 47</p>
<p>662</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<ol start="25" type="I">
<li>ETHICS AND POLITICS</li>
</ol>
<p>There were in Diderot at least two characters, as in us all: a
private self, preserving secretly all the impulses of human nature as
found in primitive, savage, even animal, life; and a public self
reluctantly accepting education, discipline, and morality as the price
to be paid for protection by social order. There were still other selves
in him: the Diderot who had not for- gotten his youth, his Bohemian
liberties and loves, his freedom from re- sponsibilities except to the
police; and there was the paterfamilias who, if al - lowed a mistress
capable of understanding his language and ideas, could be also,
intermittently, a fairly good husband, a doting father, a half-domesti-
cated animal, a man with some appreciation of money, morality, and
law.</p>
<p>This Jekyll and Hyde produced, between 1770 and 1772, two dialogues
illustrating the vacillation of his views. In Entretien d’un pere avec
ses enfants he drew a loving picture of his father gently expounding
“the danger of those who put themselves above the law.” But two years la
ter he wrote the most radical of all his works. Louis Antoine de
Bougainville had just (1771) published his Voyage autour du monde,
recounting his ex- periences in Tahiti and other South Pacific isles.
Diderot seized upon parts of the narrative as illustrating certain
superiorities of savagery to civiliza- tion. To elucidate these he
composed (1772), with his usual verve, imagina- tion, and partiality, a
Supplement au Voyage de Bougmnville, which saw the light only in 1796.
He took up an old Tahitian mentioned by Bougain- ville, and fancied him
making a farewell address to the admiral of the de- parting French:</p>
<p>And you, chief of the brigands who obey you, quickly push off</p>
<p>your vessel from our shore. We are innocent, we are happy; all
you</p>
<p>can do for us is to spoil our happiness. We follow the pure instinct
of nature; you have sought to efface its character from our souls. Here
all things belong to all men; you have preached some strange distinc-
tion between “thine” and “mine.” Our daughters an d our wives were held
in common by us all; you have shared this privilege with us, and . . .
have inflamed them with frenzies unknown before. … You</p>
<p>have slaughtered each other for them; they have come back stained
with your blood.</p>
<p>We are free, and behold, you have planted in our earth the title
of</p>
<p>our future slavery. . . . On this metal blade you have written,
This</p>
<p>country is ours. . . . And why? Because you have set foot here?
If</p>
<p>a Tahitian disembarked one day upon your shores, and graved upon one
of your stones . . . This country belongs to the inhabitants of
Tahiti,</p>
<p>what would you think of such a proceeding? . . .</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>He whom you wish to seize like an animal, the Tahitian, is your</p>
<p>brother. . . . What right have you over him that he has not over</p>
<p>you? You came. Did we fall upon you? Did we pillage your ships?</p>
<p>. . . No. We respected our image in you. Leave us our customs,
they</p>
<p>are wiser and more honorable than yours. We have no wish to barter
what you call our ignorance against your useless knowledge . 48</p>
<p>The Nestor of Tahiti goes on to remind the Europeans how cordial was
the welcome they had received; how they were housed and fed and loved.
For (Diderot supposed) there was no Sixth Commandment in the island, and
no jealousy; the native women could not understand the ship’s chap -
lain when he spoke of sin and shame; they gave the ultimate hospitality
to the sailors. With what result? Syphilis, unknown to the islanders
before, was now appearing in the native women, and was being
communicated to the native men. The old man begs the visitors to leave
the island and never return.</p>
<p>Diderot added a “Conversation of the Chaplain and Orou”— a native who
had learned Spanish. Orou, on whose hut the chaplain has been billeted,
offers him the choice of his wife and daughters as his bedmate. The
chap- lain explains that his moral code forbids him to accept such a
favor, but one of the girls touches him and he becomes a man. He spends
the next three days explaining Christian ethics to Orou, and the next
three nights sleeping in turn with a second daughter and a third
daughter, and “the fourth night, as in honor bound, he consecrated to
the wife o f his host .” 49 His efforts to convert Orou to Christianity
provide Diderot with a joyful page:</p>
<p>chaplain. What is marriage with you?</p>
<p>orou. Agreement to share the same hut and sleep in the same bed as
long as we wish to do so.</p>
<p>chaplain. And when you wish no longer?</p>
<p>orou. We separate.</p>
<p>chaplain. And what happens to the children?</p>
<p>This is no problem, says Orou; the lady returns with them to her
father; she is soon courted by another man, who is glad to accept her
children, for children are economic assets in an agricultural
society.</p>
<p>chaplain. Can a father sleep with his daughter, a mother with her</p>
<p>son, a brother with his sister, a husband with another man’s
wife?</p>
<p>orou. Why not?</p>
<p>chaplain. I suppose, however, that even here a son does not often
sleep with his mother.</p>
<p>orou. Not unless he has a great deal of respect for her . 30</p>
<p>66 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXThe chaplain comes away almost won to “Tahitian” ways; he admits
that he “was tempted to throw his clothes into the ship and pass the
rest of his life among” these “children of nature.” Diderot concludes
almost as his former friend Rousseau had argued in his Discourse on the
Arts and Sci- ences (1750) and his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality
(1755):</p>
<p>Would you like an abridged account of almost all our wretched-</p>
<p>ness? Here it is. There existed a natural man. There was
introduced</p>
<p>into this man an artificial man; and a civil war, enduring throughout
life, arose. . . . Sometimes the natural man is stronger, sometimes he
is struck down by the moral and artificial man. In either case the poor
monster is pulled about, pinched with tweezers, tortured, stretched on
the wheel, . . . ceaselessly unhappy. 31</p>
<p>Diderot, of course, was very poorly informed about the Tahitians.</p>
<p>Bougainville himself had described them as ridden with superstitions
and taboos, terrified by imaginary evil spirits, and subject to priests,
not to mention a variety of insects and diseases. Diderot, restless in
monogamy, was in no mood to understand why the necessities of social
order had placed so many restraints upon the lawless sexual instincts of
mankind. He was one more example of the individual intellect imagining
itself wiser than the customs of the race.</p>
<p>There is an amusing contrast between the ethical philosophy of
Diderot the writer and that of Diderot the man. Theoretically, at times,
his moral ideas verged upon anarchism. In those moments he described
human nature as basically good, and on this assumption he proposed to
“follow nature”— i.e., instinct. Only through instinct, he felt, could
the individual free him- self from the bonds that religion and society
lay upon him with their thousand conventions, prohibitions, and laws. In
this mood he described coitus as “the sovereign happiness”; 32 he
defined love as “the voluptuous rubbing of two membranes,” and “the
voluptuous loss of a few drops of liquid”; 53 and he assured his
mistress that adultery “is a fault less reprehensi - ble than the
slightest lie.”’ 54 He was a philosopher longing to live like a
rooster.</p>
<p>As his experience of life widened he reversed almost all his ethical
views. Veering from Rousseau toward Voltaire, he took an increasingly
gloomy view of man as bad by nature as well as through social
deterioration. “Nothing shows so well how detestable human nature is as
the facility with which people consent to the most wicked acts when 〔as
in a crowd〕 . . . nobody is personally responsible for the evil that is
done.”’ 5 “Believe me,” says Jacques the Fatalist, “we never pity anyone
but ourselves.” 50 Now Diderot cancels his earlier exaggerations with
new ones: “The natural man” would “twist his father’s neck and sleep
with his mother were it not</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>66 5</p>
<p>for the development of his reason by education .” 57 As his sexual
needs diminished, Diderot came to agree with Epicurus that “the
pleasures of the soul” are more steadily satisfying than physical
delights . 38 “Is there,” he asks, “only physical pleasure in possessing
a beautiful woman? Is there only physical pain in losing her by death or
inconstancy? Is not the distinction between physical and moral as solid
as that between the animalcule that feels and the animal that reasons?”
59</p>
<p>Now that he had arrived at the biological conception of virtue as any
quality that makes for survival, he came vaguely to understand that the
highest virtues are those that make for the survival of the group, since
social organization is the chief means of individual survival. Diderot
recognized, in the nephew of Rameau, what happens to one who tries to
cast off the restraints imposed upon the individual for the preservation
of the group; such a man becomes a derelict without faith, food, mate,
or hope. So Diderot concludes his dream of Tahiti with a tardy council
of moderation: “We w ill preach against insensate laws until they are
reformed. But mean- while we will submit to them. He who of his own
authority infringes a bad law authorizes everyone else to infringe a
good one. It is less inconvenient to be mad among madmen than to be wise
all alone .” 00</p>
<p>When his daughter Angelique developed the charms of young woman-
hood, Diderot began to worry about her morals. He watched over her
virginity as a precious and marketable asset, and after he had seen her
safely married he warned her against adultery; the very suspicion of in-
fidelity on her part, he told her, would crush him with grief and make
him die of shame . 61 In his art criticisms he denounced Boucher as
corrupt, and exalted modesty and other Christian virtues as pictured by
Greuze and Chardin; in his plays he preached the old virtues like any
settled and pros- perous bourgeois. Diderot amused himself with such
pieces of reckless humor as the Supplement cm Voyage de Bougainville,
and with anarchistic revels of imagination at the dinners of d’Holbach;
but when he came home he insisted upon all the middle-class virtues, and
tried to practice them if only he might be allowed a little
adultery.</p>
<p>His political ideas were as confused as his views of morality, and
with his good-humored candor he admitted it. He did not agree with
Voltaire that an enlightened monarch would prove the best available
instrument of reform; he condemned Frederick the Great as a tyrant, and
he tried to con- vert Catherine the Great to democratic ideas. He
accepted constitutional monarchy, but proposed a national assembly —
chosen by property owners as having a stake in good and economical
government . 02 (When he wrote this, none but the propertied middle
class could be imagined as a possible substitute for the aristocracy in
the government of France.) He dreamed of a benign society in which both
liberty and equality (those natural ene-</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmies) would be assured to all, but he doubted if any reforms would
be effective until widespread education should have raised the average
in- telligence of the people.*</p>
<p>His economic ideas were radical in theory, moderate in application.
Even in old ag e he clung to an anarchistic communism as his ideal. “I
am con - vinced that there cannot be any real happiness for mankind
except in a social state in which there would be no king, no magistrate,
no priest, no laws, no thine or mine, no ownership of pro perty, no
vices or virtues”; 65 but he confessed that this prospect is “
diablement ideal.”™ “What a devilish social economy we have!” exclaimed
the nephew of Rameau. “There are some men who are gorged with
everything, while others, who have stom- achs just as importunate,
haven’t a bite to put between their teeth.” 87 Diderot knew, in his
sober moments, that inequality of possessions will continue as long as
inequality of ability remains. He dismissed socialism as impracticable
because as yet there was only a small, disorganized, and hardly
conscious proletariat; but he hoped that the status of these workers
would soon be raised. When it came to practical reforms, he stood with
the physiocrats on the side of nascent capitalism. He declared the
rights of property to be sacred and absolute, condemned any infringement
of those rights by the state, and joined with Quesnay, Turgot, and
Voltaire in call- ing for the liberation of industry and commerce from
governmental con- trols. 68 He favored state subsidies to agriculture as
that part of the economy that was most vital and yet most at the mercy
of the rest. 60 Like all of us, he grew more conservative as his years
and his income increased.</p>

<li>DIDEROT ON ART</li>
</ol>
<p>All this rambling invasion of theology, ethics, politics, and
economics constituted merely a few sides of Diderot’s polymorphous
interest and ac - tivity; there were many more. Who would have thought
that this burly Jack-of-all-ideas would become, overnight, the leading
art critic of his age?</p>
<p>In 1759 his friend Grimm, busy with war and Mme. d’Epinay, asked</p>
<p>Diderot to substitute for him in reporting to the clientele of his
Corre- spondance the biennial exhibitions of paintings and sculpture in

<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>66 7</p>
<p>Diderot reported the Salons between 1759 and 1771, and those of 1775
and 1781, sometimes at great length, for in these notes he let himself
wander freely over almost every phase of human life. Nothing so fresh
and inti- mate had ever appeared in art criticism before. Some of his
critiques were cast in the form of conversations with painters at the
exhibition itself; some were introduced as a personal communication to
Grimm — as in 1761:</p>
<p>Here, my friend, are the ideas that have passed through my head</p>
<p>on seeing the pictures exhibited in this year’s Salon. I throw them
upon the paper without much care to select them or to express them. . .
.</p>
<p>The only thought I have had in mind is to spare you some moments</p>
<p>that you will employ better. 70</p>
<p>He went at his new task with ebullient delight. He thanked Grimm for
compelling him to look at the exhibited art not with the “superficial
and distracted gaze” of the passing crowd, but with the resolve to study
each canvas or marble until he really felt its artistry and
significance. He had no technical preparation, but he talked with the
artists themselves — Chardin, La Tour, Cochin, Falconet . . . ; he
studied their method of composition, brushwork, and coloring. “I opened
my soul to the effects 〔produced by the artist’s labor〕; I conceived
the magic of the light and the shade; I un - derstood color; I acquired
the feeling of the flesh.” 71</p>
<p>He became in the end a competent critic of technique. But,
disclaiming all technical knowledge, he proposed merely to say what each
work meant to him. First he described the subject or story in some
detail, since most of Grimm’s clientele would never see the pieces in
question; some clients,</p>
<p>however, bought pictures on Did erot’s recommendation. Often he would
imagine, and graphically recount, the living drama of which the artist
rep- resented only the concentrated, telling moment; at times he turned
art into literature; and at last he could boast: “Chardin, La Grenee, Gr
euze, and others . . . have assured me that I was the only literary man
whose images could pass upon the canvas almost as they had succeeded one
another in my head.” 72</p>
<p>He expressed his preferences and prejudices with unabashed candor.
After denouncing almost everything in contemporary French civilization,
he defended French painters with patriotic ardor. He called Hogarth a
liar and an ignoramus for saying that France had no colorist. “Chardin,”
he retorted, “is perhaps one of the greatest colorists in all painting.”
73 He was severe on Nattier. He railed at Boucher’s nudes, but enjoyed
them. After criticizing the defects in one nude he added: “All the same,
let me have her just as she is, and I do not think I shall waste time
complaining that her hair is too dark.” A picture of Joseph rejecting
the advances of Potiphar’s wife angered him. “I can’t imagine what he
could have wanted. I wouldn’t</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhave asked for any better, and I have often settled for less.” 74
He sympa - thized with artists who painted nudes, and especially with
sculptors who modeled them; after all, “what can you do in statuary with
buttons and pants?” 75 He liked Greuze’s pict ures of girlish innocence;
he fully shared Greuze’s sentimentality; he particularly appreciated the
portraits of</p>
<p>Greuze’s wife, who had been Diderot’s mistress in his youth. He
relished the wild landscapes in Dutch and Flemish art, and found “more
poetr y in a single tree which has suffered the buffets of the years and
seasons, than in all the fa5ade of a palace. A palace must be in ruins
to be an object of interest.” 70 He rejected the classic emphasis on
rationality, order, and har - mony, and exalted creative imagination
above analytical reason. He called for “compositions terrible or
sensuous, which . . . carry love or terror to the depths of your heart,
dissolve your senses, and purge your soul; there is something in that
which no rules can achi eve.” 77 He despised the notion of “art for
art’s sake”; art, he thought, had a moral task: “to honor virtue and
expose vice.” 78</p>
<p>To his observations on the Salon of 1765 Diderot felt confident
enough to add an “Essai sur la peinture.” Like Plato and Aristotle he
found the es- sence of beauty in the harmonious relation of parts in a
whole; but he sug- gested that there must also be a harmony of the
object with its environment and with its intended purpose. Ideally, he
thought beauty might be defined as complete adaptation to function; so a
healthy and intelligent man should seem beautiful. Art should select, in
a scene, the features that point its sig- nificance, and should
eliminate irrelevant elements; it need not be a slavish imitation of the
objective and indiscriminate reality. Yet the artist must study the
natural object rather than ancient models or formal rules; better one
Teniers than a dozen fanciful Watteaus. Diderot felt a certain discord
between reason and art; he recognized that Boileau’s classical precepts
had crippled French poetry. Here he left Voltaire and sided with
Rousseau: art must above all be the voice and product of feeling.
Therefore he ex- alt ed color, while Reynolds in the same decade was
extolling design. “De - sign gives form to beings,” Diderot conceded,
“but color gives them life.” 79 Goethe found many things in this essay
that seemed to him wrong, but he translated portions of it, and d
escribed it to Schiller as “a magnificent work; it speaks even more
usefully to the poet than to the painter, though for the painter too it
is a torch of powerful illumination.” 80</p>

<li>DIDEROT AND THE THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>“When I was young,” Diderot wrote, “I h esitated between the Sorbonne
〔priesthood〕 and the stage.” 81 And in 1774: “For some thirty years I
have</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>669</p>
<p>against my taste made the Encyclopedic, and written only two plays.”
82 He attached more importance to his plays than to his novels; and as
most of his novels were published only after his death, his plays had
the greater influence on his fame and his life. And they constituted
almost a revolu- tion in the history of the French theater.</p>
<p>He had read with emotion the novels of Richardson; in 1761 he wrote
an tLloge de Richardson, rising to lyric praise of the Englishman for
his evoca- tion of feeling, his inculcation of virtue, his courage in
picturing middle- class life as worthy of serious art. Moreover, Diderot
had been impressed by George Lillo’s The London Merchant (1731), which
had successfully brought the sentiments and tribulations of the business
class to the English stage. He called the play “sublime,” even co mpared
it with Sophocles; why should not broken hearts be worthy of tragic
drama despite their lack of pedigree? When Diderot took to composing
plays in the genre serieux he startled French conventions by using
middle-class characters and writing in prose. So in 1757 he sent to
stage and press Le Fils naturel, ou les epreuves de la vertu. It had no
success on the boards; it was acted twice in the provinces (1757), not
till 1771 in Paris, and then, apparently, only once. But in its printed
form it became a cause celehre.</p>
<p>The story was interesting enough. The virtuous, prosperous bastard
Dorval finds himself falling in love with Rosalie, the betrothed of his
host, Clairville. He perceives that she returns his affection; he
resolves to absent himself rather than ruin the nuptials of his friend.
As he is about to leave he sees Clairville attacked by armed assailants;
he fights them and saves his friend’s life. When he learns that
Rosalie’s merchant father has lost his fortune and can give her no
dowry, he secretly makes up her loss. The bankrupt merchant turns out to
be Dorval’s father as well as Rosalie’s; she reconciles herself to being
his sister; she marries Clairville; Dorval marries Clairville’s sister
Constance, and the play ends wit h everyone bathed in tears of joy. This
was Diderot’s contribution to what critics had already termed la comedie
larmoy ante — the drama of tears.*</p>
<p>What gave the play a place in French history was a series of
dialogues published with it, and later entitled Entretiens sur Le Fils
naturel. The tradition of the French theater was that serious (as
distinguished from comic) drama should concern itself only with
personages of the nobility, and should be written in verse. Diderot now
expounded his view that seri- ous drama should not be afraid to use
bourgeois characters and occupa- tions, and scenes from domestic life,
presented with realism and in prose. He proposed to show that the phrase
bourgeois gentilhomme (middle-class gentleman) was not the laughable
contradiction-in-terms that Moliere had</p>
<ul>
<li>Comedie and comedien meant drama and actor rather than comedy and

<p>XXtaken it to be, but a development of the new society in which the
bourgeoi- sie was rising in wealth, status, and power. The dramatist, he
argued, should present not so much studies in character as conditions of
actual life — e.g., in the family, in the army, in politics, in the
professions, even in industry. And as the middle classes were a chief
repository of virtue in France, Diderot insisted that one function of
the new drome (as he called it) should be “to inspire men with love of
virtue and abhorrence of vice.” He branded a merely entertaining art as
an idle-class luxury; every art should have a social function and use;
and what better aim could the theater have than to make virtue
charming?</p>
<p>The play and its accompanying pronunciamento divided intellectual
Paris into hostile camps. Palissot and other antiphilosophes ridiculed
Di- derot’s ideas. Freron did not merely criticize the play as dull
didacticism wet with sentiment and unreal virtue, but he showed, in
successive issues of his Annee litteraire, a suspicious similarity
between the first half of Le Fils naturel and the comedy II veto amico
(The True Friend) which Gol- doni had staged at Venice in 1750. Diderot
confessed:</p>
<p>I took possession of it as if it were a piece of property belonging
to</p>
<p>me. Goldoni has not been more scrupulous. He laid hold of L’Avare</p>
<ul>
<li>Moliere’s The Miser 〕 without anyone taking it into his head to
find that bad; and no one among us has dreamed of accusing Moliere or
Corneille of plagiarism for having tacitly borrowed the idea of some
play either from an Italian author or from the Spanish theater. 83</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this was true of Corneille’s Le Cid and Moliere’s Le Festin
de pierre ( Don Juan).</p>
<p>Encouraged by friends, defiant of his enemies, and amid the
direst</p>
<p>troubles of the Encyclopedic , Diderot wrote and published (1758)
another play, Le Fere de famille, and added to it a provocative
“Discours sur la poesie dramatique”— a title reminiscent of the one that
Dryden had used for a similar essay ninety years before. The Family
Father was produced in Toulouse and Marseilles in 1760, and at the
Theatre-Frangais in Paris in February, 1761; there it ran for seven
nights, which was considered a mod- erate success. Voltaire allowed
performances of his tragedy Toner ede to be postponed to permit this
run, and he wrote to his new rival: “Oh, my dear brother Diderot! I
yield you my place with all my heart, and I should like to crown you
with laurel.” Diderot replied: “Thank you, my dear master. I know how
much you must have desired the success of your disciple, and I am
touched by it. My affection and homage to the end of my life.” 84 The
play was successfully revived at the Theatre -Frangais in 1769, and
became a minor element in the triumph of the philosophes.</p>
<p>The plot was partly autobiographical. The father is a loving

<p>of Didier Diderot, except that he preaches far more than that good
man had been reported to do. The son, Saint-Albin (a fond portrait of
Denis Diderot), seeks parental permission to marry Sophie, a girl of the
working class. The father consents to see her, likes her, but refuses to
let his son marry so poor a lass. After five acts, and by a coincidence
that has served a thousand dramas, the young lady turns out to be a
daughter of excellent family; the father relents; all is well. Freron
could be pardoned for calling the plot melodramatic, mechanical, and
absurd. One critic pointed out that this ode to virtue was dedicated to
Grimm, who had shared a prostitute with Rousseau and was now the lover
of Mme. d’Epinay, and that Diderot had named the heroine after his
mistress Sophie Volland. Voltaire, while complimenting the author on the
“tender and virtuous things” in the play, wrote to Mme. du Deffand:
“Have you had Le Fere de famille read to you? Isn’t it ludicrous? In
faith, our century is a poor one compared to that of Louis XIV.” 85</p>
<p>Diderot, however, felt that the seventeenth-century French drama had
been a thoroughly unnatural form — in its pompous, declamatory style, in
its straitlaced unities of action, place, and time, and in its supine
imitation of ancient classics rather than of living realities. His
plays, unashamedly sen- timental, were omens of the Romantic reaction
against the intellectualism and emotional rest raint of the classic age.
Diderot’s influence was felt also in the increasing realism of scenic
sets, in the historic veracity of the actors’</p>
<p>He had his say also on the histrionic art. In a challenging essay,
Paradoxe sur le comedien (1778), he argued that to move an audience the
actor must not surrender himself to the emotion he expresses, but must
remain com- pletely self-possessed. This, of course, flew in the face of
Horace’s advice to poets, “Si vis me flere, primum tibi flendum est” (If
you wish me to weep you must first weep yourself) . No, said Diderot;
the actor</p>
<p>must have in himself an unmoved and disinterested onlooker. He must
have penetration and no sensibility … If the actor were full, really</p>
<p>full, of feeling, how could he play the same part twice running
with</p>
<p>the same spirit and success? Full of fire at the first performance,

<p>front of the theater with tearful creatures, but I will have none of
them on the boards. 8 “</p>
<p>(A counsel hardly followed by those who acted Diderot’s plays.)</p>
<p>It was a paradox in Didero t himself, for in 1757 he had written:
“Poets 〔and〕 actors . . . feel intensely, and reflect little.”““ Now
he reversed him - self, perhaps after watching David Garrick, in Paris
(1763, 1770), simulate diverse emotions in quick succession and at will.
Or he might have found his paradox in Hamlet’s bidding to the players at
Elsinore: “In the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of
passion, acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.”“ 1
Sir Henry Irving re - jected Diderot ’s analysis, but a modern critic
believes that “it has remained to this day the most significant attempt
to deal with the problem of act- ing.” 32 Actors may be emotional in
life, but not on the stage. (Perhaps their self-control on the stage
leads to their emotional release in life; hence many sins must be
forgiven them.) They must study the indicated feeling in its causes, and
express it in their gestures and speech, but they must “remem - ber” it
“in tranquillity.” 93 Diderot struck the balance in a letter to Mile.
Jodin: “An actor who has nothing but sense and judgment is cold; one who
has nothing but verve and sensibility is mad.” 94</p>
<p>Looking back upon this disorderly review of Diderot ’s chaotic mind,
we forgive his confusion in the literally magnanimous profusion of his
ideas and the scope of his interests. Nothing human was alien to him
except re- ligion, and even there, as we have seen, he was not immune to
religious feeling. It was characteristic of him to begin with
mathematics and physics, and end with drama and music. He could not be a
great scientist, being too impatient for research and experiment; he
leaped too buoyantly to generalizations, but these were almost always
illuminating. He knew enough about music to write a method of clavecin
instruction and a treatise on harmony. He composed the most influential
plays, and the best novels, of his time; in the short story he excelled
all his contemporaries except Vol- taire; and he surpassed Voltaire
himself in giving to the short story that concentration of thought and
action which determined the form into our own day. Addicted to
conversation and trained in the salons, he developed the dialogue to a
brilliance and vitality seldom equaled before or since. And he wrote
philosophy not in a secret language for ivory towers, but as a living
debate, on living themes, among men willingly caught in the stream of
the world.</p>

<p>Behind this kaleidoscopic mind was a man of many virtues and almost
every fault, each taking its turn on the stage of his life. When Adichel
Vanloo painted him Diderot protested that the face in the picture showed
only a fleeting part of him, merely one expression of but one mood.</p>
<p>I had a hundred different expressions in a day, according to the</p>
<p>mood that was on me. I was serene, sad, dreamy, tender, violent, pas-
sionate, eager. The outward signs of my many and varying states of</p>
<p>mind chased one another so rapidly across my face that the painter’s
eye caught a different me from moment to moment, and never got one right
. 95</p>
<p>Gradually, however, those many faces merged into a composite mold,
and left him the rugged physiognomy that we see in the portrait by
Greuze: as somber as Caesar, worn out by his passionate encounters with
an army of ideas and enemies, and by attempts to express in static words
the fluent nuances of his yes-and- no’s. High brow receding on a half
-bald head; large rustic ears and big bent nose, firm mouth and fighting
chin, brown eyes heavy and sad, as if recalling unrecallable errors, or
realizing the indestruc- tibility of superstition, or noting the high
birth rate of simplicity. Usually in public he wore a wig, but when he
lost himself in the ecstasy of mono- logue he might remove it, play with
it, or rest it on his lap. He was ab- sorbed in being, and had no time
for seeming.</p>
<p>He yielded to no one in appreciation of his character. He admitted,
“I get excited for a moment”; but “a moment later I am myself again, the
frank, gentle, just, indulgent, honest, charitable, obliging man.
Continue, if you please, this eulogy, for it isn’t complete. I haven’t
said anything about my intellige nce.” He doubted if any man alive was
more honest than he, and he was sure that even the “pillars of the
Church” would rely upon his word. “What beautiful souls yours, mine, and
his are!” he wrote to his mis - tress, letting Grimm into the trinity.
He spoke with rapture about his books and plays, confident of their
immortality. He thought his morals excellent, and indeed he had only one
mistress at a time. He spoke of him- self as “the philosopher,” and
acknowledged his likeness to Socrates. “What doe s it matter,” he asked,
“whether I owe my estimable qualities to nature</p>
<p>Actually he had most of the virtues with which he credited himself.
He was honest in the sense of candid, though he had done a deal of lying
in his youth. There was no pose or affectation in him. He was gentle

<p>XXGeoffrin had to call him to order and decency. He certainly had
courage, for he continued to fight when so many friends deserted him,
when even Voltaire advised him to quit. He was just, except to piety and
Rousseau; we may see later that he did not suf ficiently allow for Jean
Jacques’ sensi - bility. He was unquestionably generous, always ready to
aid those who appealed to him, and more lavish in praise of others than
of himself. He spent many days substituting for Grimm in the
Correspondence, or put- ting into effective shape the literary efforts
of his friends. He helped a long succession of poor people with gifts
out of his modest income. When a needy scribe showed him a satire on
Diderot and asked him to revise it, saying that he needed bread, Diderot
revised and improved it, and sug- gested that he dedicate it to the
current Due d’Orleans, “who does me the honor to hate me.” It was so
done, and the Duke sent the young author twenty-five louis. 97 He was
lenient in his criticisms of books and paintings (excepting Boucher’s),
saying that he preferred to point to the good rather</p>
<p>He was assuredly richer than Voltaire in ideas, for there were no
checks and balances in his constitution. He was more imaginative, less
rational, more impetuous, never mature. “Diderot,” said Voltaire, “is
too hot an oven; everything that is baked in it gets burned”; 100 even
so, many things came out half baked. He was as keen as Rousseau in
sensibility, as tender in his sentiments, as ready to weep over the
loveliness of nature and the tragedies of life. He made his religieuse
say, and it probably expressed him- self, “For a tender soul the
shedding of tears is a delicious condition.” 101 His visitors sometimes
found him in tears — or in a rage — over a book. Per- haps his
friendship with Rousseau was based upon a community of senti- ment, the
same exaltation of feeling, the same love of nature, the same ro- mantic
conception of genius as instinct, passion, and imagination, the same
enthusiasm for the novels of Richardson. He longed to warn Clarissa
against Lovelace, and when he read of cruel kings he could easily
imagine himself “using a dagger with marvelous facility.” 102 Voltaire +
Rousseau = Di - derot; neither of those two could forgive him for
including them both while remaining unique and himself.</p>
<p>His habits expressed the ambivalence of his qualities. He liked good
food to the point of gourmandizing and gallstones, but he was alive to
all the cultural offerings of his time. He hated and ridiculed travel,
103 but he</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>

<p>675</p>
<p>crossed Europe to slap the thighs of Catherine the Great. He wept
over beautiful poetry, and indulged in coarse obscenity. He despised
money, and talked of poverty as the inspiring friend of philosophers;
but when his father died he went to Langres (1759) and was glad to get
his third of the patrimony, so that by 1760 he had an income of four
thousand livres per year. “I need a carriage,” he said, “a comfortable
apartment 〔it was a duplex〕, fine linen, a perfumed woman, and I could
easily put up with the other curses of our civilized state”; here the
Voltaire in him checked and laughed at the Rousseau.</p>
<p>His wife was too busy with frustrated motherhood and unperfumed
housework to provide a fit and necessary audience for his proliferating
ideas. Like Milton he cried out for divorce on grounds of intellectual
in- compatibility. Not allowed this, he did what the French still do —
he took a mistress. There was, briefly, Mile. Babuti, who became Mme.
Greuze. Then Mme. de Puisieux, who held him for a decade. In 1755 he
found just what he needed: a young woman who for eighteen years gave him
love, fidelity, and understanding. Louise Henriette Volland (whom he re-
christened Sophie because she seemed to him the soul of wisdom) was al-
ready thirty-eight when they first met — unmarried, plump, shortsighted;
he described her as wearing spectacles on a rather “dried - up” face,
and he had to scold her, now and then, for rivaling his appetite. But
she had gathered books instead of lovers; she had read widely, even in
politics and philosophy; she talked well, and listened better. Diderot
found her legs too thick, but he was grateful for her ears, and loved
her mind and heart.</p>
<p>Ah, Grimm 〔he wrote〕, what a woman! How tender she is, how</p>
<p>sweet, how honest, delicate, sensible! She reflects . . . We
don’t</p>
<p>know any more than she does in customs, morals, feelings, in an in-
finity of important things. She has her judgment, views, ideas, her own
way of thinking, formed according to reason, truth, and common</p>
<p>sense; neither public opinion nor authorities, nor anything, can sub-
jugate them. 104</p>
<p>This could not all be infatuation, for the objective Dr. Tronchin saw
in her “the soul of an eagle in a house of gauze”; 105 that is, she
loved fine clothes and intellectual flights.</p>
<p>To her, through twenty years, Diderot wrote his finest letters, which
remain among the literary treasures of the eighteenth century. He could
write to her frankly about everything; he could send her his bawdy
stories and his latest speculations; he would write to her as he would
talk “if I were at your side, an arm on the back of your chair.” 106 In
his relation - ship with her he realized, as never before, the part that
feeling and senti- ment can play in life. Now he could hardly believe in
determinism; it</p>
<p>676</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXseemed incredible that their complex exchange of devotion and ideas
could be the physicochemical result of some primeval nebula. Sometimes,
in such a mood, he could even speak of God. He told Sophie how, walking
in the countryside with Grimm, he plucked a blade of wheat and fell into
thought over the mystery of growth. “What are you doing?” asked Grimm.
“I am listening.” “Who is talking to you?” “God.” 107</p>
<p>After some twelve years of his liaison with Sophie Volland his love
sub- sided, his letters grew shorter, his protestations of fidelity more
forced. In 1769, aged fifty-seven, he succeeded his dead friend
Damilaville as the lover of Mme. de Meaux, aged fifty-four. A year later
a younger gallant displaced Diderot. Meanwhile Denis continued to assure
Sophie of his “eternal love.”</p>
<p>Through all the wanderings of his heart and mind his wife,
Antoinette, bore with him faithfully, scolded him incontinently, and
sought consola- tion in religion and cards. They quarreled almost daily,
and time did not bridge the gap between the man with a thousand ideas
and the woman with one God. When his friends came to visit him they
never stopped to greet her. When she discovered his affair with Sophie
she burst into a fury which seemed to him quite unproportioned to so
common a diversion. For a while he had his meals served to him in his
study. “She is beginning to feel the effects of this little divorce,” he
wrote to Grimm. “The exhaustion of her funds, which is not dist ant,
will bring reconciliation.” 108 She fell sick, he relented, and tended
her with grumbling care. She responded with such sweetness that he
thought, she must be dying; however, he described her illness jokingly
in a letter to Sophie. When his friend Suard proposed to marry, Diderot
advised him to drown himself instead. (Suard’s marriage was one of the
happiest in that unhappy age.)</p>
<p>Probably Diderot would have fled from his home had he not so loved
his domestic comforts and his pretty daughter. Antoinette was
forty-three when (1753) she bore her fourth child. As Marie Angelique
grew up</p>
<p>through all the charms of girlhood, Diderot concentrated all his
tenderness upon her. He joined her in her games; we picture the topheavy
philosopher playing hopscotch with her, and hide-and- seek, and
blindman’s buff. “I was crazy about my little girl. What a lovely
character! What a woman I</p>
<p>could make of her if her mother would let me!” He took care to
preach</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>677</p>
<p>husband in due time. He made the choice, Antoinette disapproved,
Ange- lique approved, and was married (1772). Diderot wept at losing
her, and wept still more when he saw her happiness in marriage. He
helped the young couple generously, saying, “Isn’t it better to help
them at a difficult moment than to wait until they no longer need
anything?” The son -in-law became a successful manufacturer, whose
descendants, after the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy (1814),
became cautious conservatives.</p>
<p>As Diderot matured through parentage he began to understand his
father better, and to honor the code of morals that helped a man to
bring up a good family. But much of the Bohemian remained in him. Though
he loved his den, his old clothes and slippers, and liked to toast his
toes before a fire, he absented himself from such felicity now and then,
as when he spent a month with d’Holbach at Grandval. He still frequented
the cafes, and was a familiar figure in some salons. Mme. Geoffrin loved
him despite his rough speech, and in a burst of maternal affection she
sent him a new desk, cozy armchairs of leather, a great clock of gold
and bronze, and a luxurious dressing gown. He thanked her, and sadly let
his old furniture be taken away; but he expressed tender regrets for his
discarded robe de chcmibre:</p>
<p>Why did I not keep it? It was just made for me, and I was made
for</p>
<p>it. It followed everv fold in mv bodv without inconveniencing me.</p>
<p>It was picturesque and handsome. The new robe, stiff and starched,
makes a mannequin of me. There w as no call to which its good nature did
not lend itself. … If a book was covered with dust, one of its</p>
<p>flaps was readv as a duster. When the ink on my pen was thick and</p>
<p>w’ould not flowper its side was readv. You could see, traced in long
black stripes, the frequent services it had rendered me. These long
stripes an- nounced the man of letters, the w r riter, the toiler. At
present I look like one of the idle rich; no one recognizes me. … I was
absolute master of my old dressing gown; I have become the slave of the
new 7 one. 110</p>
<p>He counted his friendships the chief solace and inspiration of his
life. His association with Grimm was closer and more permanent than any
of his loves. In 1772, when they had known each other for twenty-two
years, he wrote to him: “My tender, my only friend, you have alw 7 ays
been, you will always be, my dear and only friend.” 111 Yet there were
times when he was keenly hurt by Grimm’s coldness and seeming indi
fference. The Ger- man exploited Diderot’s good nature, often delegating
to him the writing of his Correspovdcmce Diderot substituted for him not
only in reporting the Salon exhibitions but in review ing the latest
books; and sometimes he w 7 orked through the night to meet the deadline
that Grimm had laid dow 7 n. 112 Grimm offered to pay him; Diderot
refused to be paid. It is sad to relate that when (1773) Stanislas II
Poniatowski, King of Poland, hear-</p>

<p>XXing that Diderot was planning to visit St. Petersburg, proposed to
invite him to stop in Warsaw, Grimm advised the King that there would be
no profit in making the philosopher’s acquaintance. “Instead of
utilizing his time to share the glory of genius with Voltaire, Diderot
wastes it writing scrap for these 〔 Correspondence 〕 sheets, or giving
it away to all who are bold enough to ask for it. I dare say to your
Majesty that he will die</p>
<p>unknown .” 113</p>
<p>Probably Diderot’s happiest hours (aside from t hose he spent
with</p>
<p>Angelique) were when he took the floor at the dinners of d’Holbach or
Mme. Geoffrin, and sailed forth rudderless on a stream of eloquence on
any subject whatever. He was not at his best in polite gatherings where
wit, rather than ideas, was in demand. Mme. Geoffrin herself was fright-
ened by his enthusiasms, and her counsels of moderation and decency
weighted his flights. But at the Baron’s table, where, as Hume was
assured, “seventeen atheists” assembled, he could let himself go; and
then (nearly all agreed) there was nothing so fascinating, so absorbing,
in all the brilliant conversation of Paris. “He who has known Diderot
only in his writings,” said Marmontel, “has not known him at all. … I
have experienced few greater intellectual pleasures .” 114 Henri
Meister, who often heard him, de - scribed him in an apt comparison:</p>
<p>When I recall Diderot, the immense variety of his ideas, the amazing
multiplicity of his knowledge, the rapid flight, the warmth, the im-</p>
<p>petuous tumult of his imagination, all the charm and all the disorder
of his conversation, I venture to liken his character to nature herself,
exactly as he used to conceive her — rich, fertile, abounding in germs
of every sort, gentle and fierce, simple and majestic, worthy and sub-
lime, but without any dominating principle, without a master, and</p>
<p>without a God . 115</p>
<p>Or hear a firsthand report on Diderot’s conversation, by Proteus
himself:</p>
<p>I seemed extraordinary to them, inspired, divine. Grimm hardly had
eyes enough to see me, nor ears enough to hear me. Everybody was
astonished. I myself felt a contentment within me that I can’t express.
It was like a fire burning in my depths that seared my breast, spread
over them, and set fire to them. It was an evening of enthusiasm, for
which I was the hearth . 118</p>
<p>His contemporary reputation was greater among those who knew him than
among those who had merely read his published works, which were chiefly
the Encyclopedic and his plays; the best of them — La Religieuse,
Jacques le fataliste, Le Reve d’Alembert, Le Neveu de Rameau — were
still</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>DIDEROT PROTEUS</p>
<p>679</p>
<p>unprinted at his death. Partly for this reason, partly because of the
radical- ism of his ideas on religion and sex, he failed — and never
tried — to win ad- mission to the Academy. To his friends, however, he
was le philosophe — the philosopher, leader of the rebel tribe.
Rousseau, even after coming to hate him as a secret enemy, wr ote in the
Confessions : “At the distance of some centuries Diderot will seem a
prodigious man. People will look from afar at that universal head with
mingled admiration and astonishment, as we look today at the heads of
Plato and Aristotle .” 117</p>
<p>Goe the, Schiller, Lessing were fascinated by Diderot’s writings;
Sten - dhal, Balzac, Delacroix joined in the admiration; Comte rated him
the supreme genius of that exciting age ; 118 Michelet called him “the
true Prometheus,” and said that one could draw upon Diderot’s works for
a hundred years and infinite riches would still be left . 110 Or shall
we hear Mme. Geoffrin, who knew him well but had not read his books? “He
is a good and honest man,” she wrote, “but he is so wrongheaded, and is
so badly balanced, that he sees and hears nothing as it is; he is always
like a man who dreams, and who believes his dreams to be real .” 120</p>
<p>He was good and bad, honest and dishonest, wrongheaded and intuitive,
badly balanced and brilliantly creative, a dreamer, warrior, and seer,
whose stature in history seems to grow as his time recedes, until today
some think him “the most interesting and provocative figure of the
French eighteenth century .” 121 Let us leave the matter there until we
meet him again— face to face with an empress, and then in the rendezvous
of the philosophes with death.</p>
