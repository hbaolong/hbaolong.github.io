<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>John Calvin</p>
<p>1509-64</p>
<p>I. YOUTH</p>
<p>H E was born at Noyon, France, July 10, 1509. It was an
ecclesiastical city, dominated by its cathedral and its bishop; here at
the outset he had an example of theocracy — the rule of a society by
clergymen in the name of God. His father, Gerard Chauvin, was secretary
to the bishop, proctor in the cathedral chapter, and fiscal procurator
of the county. Jean’s mother died while he was still young; the father
married again, and perhaps Calvin owed to stern step-rearing part of his
somber spirit. Gerard destined three of his sons for the priesthood,
confident that he could place them well. He found benefices for two, but
one of these became a heretic and died refusing the sacraments. Gerard
himself was excommunicated after a finan- cial dispute with the
cathedral chapter, and had some trouble getting buried in holy
ground.</p>
<p>Jean was sent to the College de la Marche at the University of Paris.
He registered as Johannes Calvinus, and learned to write excellent
Latin. He passed later to the College de Montaigu, where he must have
heard echoes of its famous pupil Erasmus; and he remained there till
1528, when his Cath- olic counterpart, Ignatius Lo yola, entered. “The
stories told at one time of Calvin’s ill - regulated youth,” says a
Catholic authority, “have no foun - dation.” 1 On the contrary, the
available evidence indicates an assiduous stu - dent, shy, taciturn,
pious, and already “a severe censor of his comrades’ morals”; 2 yet
loved by his friends, now as later, with an unshakable fidelity. In the
hot pursuit of esoteric knowledge or fascinating theory he read far into
the night; even in those student years he developed some of the many
ailments that plagued his mature life and helped to form his mood.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, late in 1528, a directive came from his father to go to
Orleans and study law, presumably, said the son, “because he judged that
d ethics the logic, precision, and severity of Justinian’s Institutes ,
and gave his</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>460 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>own masterpiece a similar name. He became above all a lawgiver, the
Numa and Lycurgus of Geneva.</p>
<p>Having taken his degree as Licentiate or Bachelor of Laws (1531), he
returned to Paris and entered upon a voracious study of classical
literature. Feeling the common urge to see himself in print, he
published (1532) a Latin essay on Seneca’s De dementia ; the sternest of
religious legislators began his public career with a salute to mercy. He
sent a copy to Erasmus, hailing him as the “second glory” (after Cicero)
and “first delight of let - ters.” He seemed dedicated to humanism when
some sermons of Lu ther reached him and stirred him with their audacity.
Alert circles in Paris were discussing the new movement, and there must
have been much talk about the reckless monk who had burned the bull of a
pope and defied the ban of an emperor; indeed, Protestantism had already
had martyrs in France. Some men who were urging Church reform were among
Calvin’s friends; one of them, Gerard Roussel, was a favorite of the
King’s sister, Marguerite of Navarre; another, Nicholas Cop, was chosen
rector of the university, and Calvin probably had a hand in preparing
Cop’s fateful inaugural address (November 1, 1533). It began with an
Erasmian plea for a purified Chris- tianity, proceeded to a Lutheran
theory of salvation through faith and grace, and ended with an appeal
for a tolerant hearing of the new religious ideas. The speech created a
furore; the Sorbonne erupted in anger; the Parlement began proceedings
against Cop for heresy. He fled; a reward of 300 crowns was offered for
his capture alive or dead, but he managed to reach Basel, which was now
Protestant.</p>
<p>Calvin was warned by friends that he and Roussel were scheduled for
arrest. Marguerite seems to have interceded for him. He left Paris
(January</p>
<ol start="1534" type="1">
<li>and found refuge in Angouleme; and there, probably in the rich
library of Louis de Tillet, he began to write his Institutes. In May he
ventured back to Noyon, and surrendered the benefices whose income had
been sup- porting him. He was arrested there, was freed, was rearrested
and again freed. He returned clandestinely to Paris, talked with
Protestant leaders, and met Servetus, whom he was to bum. When some
Protestant extremists posted abusive placards at various points in
Paris, Francis I retaliated with a furious persecution. Calvin fled just
in time (December 1534), and joined Cop in Basel. There, a lad of
twenty-six, he completed the most eloquent, fervent, lucid, logical,
influential, and terrible work in all the literature of the reli- gious
revolution.</li>

<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE THEOLOGIAN</li>
</ol>
<p>He published the book in Latin (1536) as Christianae religionis
institutio (The Principles of the Christian Religion). Within a year the
issue was sold</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>out and a new edition was invited. Calvin responded with a much
enlarged version (1539), again in Latin; in 1541 he translated this into
French; and this form of the work is one of the most impressive
productions in the gamut of French prose. The Parlement of Paris
proscribed the book in both languages, and copies of it were publicly
burned in the capital. Calvin continued throughout his life to expand
and republish it; in its final form it ran to 1,1 18 pages.</p>
<p>The first edition opened with a passio nate but dignified “Preface to
the Most Christian King of France.” Two events gave occasion for
addressing Francis: the royal edict of January 1535 against the French
Protestants, and the almost simultaneous invitation of Francis to
Melanchthon and Bucer to come to France and arrange an alliance between
the French monarch ard the Lutheran princes against Charles V. Calvin
hoped to reinforce political expediency with theological arguments, and
help incline the King, like his sister, toward the Protestant cause. He
was anxious to dissociate this from the Anabaptist movement then verging
on communism in Munster. He de- scribed the French reformers as
patriots, devoted to the King and averse from all economic or political
disturbance. The beginning and end of this famous Preface reveal the
majesty of Calvin’s thought and stvle</p>
<p>When I began this work, Sire, nothing was further from my</p>
<p>thoughts than writing a book which would afterwards be presented to
your Majesty. My intention was only to lay down some elemen-</p>
<p>tary principles, by which inquirers on the subject of religion
might</p>
<p>be instructed in the nature of true piety But when I perceived
that</p>
<p>the fury of certain wicked men in your kingdom had grown to such</p>
<p>a height as to leave no room in the land for sound doctrine, I
thought I should be usefully employed if in the same work … I exhibited
my</p>
<p>confession to you, that you may know the nature of that doctrine</p>
<p>which is the object of such unbounded rage in those madmen who are
now disturbing the country with fire and sword. For I shall not be</p>
<p>afraid to acknowledge that this treatise contains a summary of
that</p>
<p>very doctrine, which, according to their clamors, deserves to be pun-
ished with imprisonment, banishment, proscription, and flames, and to be
exterminated from the face of the earth. I well know with what atrocious
insinuations your ears have been filled by them, in order to render our
cause most odious in your esteem; but your clemency</p>
<p>should lead you to consider that if accusation be accounted
sufficient evidence of guilt, there will be an end to all innocence in
words and actions. . . .</p>
<p>You yourself, Sire, can bear witness of the false calumnies with</p>
<p>which you hear it 〔our cause〕 daily traduced: that its only
tendency</p>
<p>is to wrest the scepters of kings out of their hands, to overturn all
the tribunals … to subvert all order and government, to disturb the
oeace</p>
<p>462 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>and tranquillity of the people, to abrogate all laws, to scatter all
prop- erties and possessions, and, in a word, to involve everything in
total confusion. . . .</p>
<p>Wherefore I beseech you, Sire — and surely it is not an unreason-</p>
<p>able request — to take upon yourself the entire cognizance of
this</p>
<p>cause, which has hitherto been confusedly and carelessly
agitated,</p>
<p>without any order of law, and with outrageous passion rather than</p>
<p>judicial gravity. Think not that I am now meditating my own indi-</p>
<p>vidual defense in order to effect a safe return to my native country;
for though I feel the affection which every man ought to feel for
it,</p>
<p>yet, under the existing circumstances, I regret not my removal from
it. But I plead the cause of all the godly, and consequently of
Christ</p>
<p>Himself. . . .</p>
<p>Is it probable that we are meditating the subversion of kingdoms?</p>
<p>— we who were never heard to utter a factious word, whose lives were
ever known to be peaceable and honest while we lived under your</p>
<p>government, and who, even now in our exile, cease not to pray for</p>
<p>all prosperity to attend yourself and your kingdom! . . . Nor have
we, by Divine Grace, profited so little in the Gospel, but that our life
may be an example to our detractors of chastity, liberality, mercy,
tem-</p>
<p>perance, patience, modesty, and every other virtue. . . .</p>
<p>Though you are now averse and alienated from us, and even in-</p>
<p>flamed against us, we despair not of regaining your favor, if you
will only read with calmness and composure this our confession,
which</p>
<p>we intend as our defense before your Majesty. But, on the contrary,
if your ears are so preoccupied with the whispers of the malevolent as
to leave no opportunity for the accused to speak for themselves,</p>
<p>and if those outrageous furies, with your connivance, continue to</p>
<p>persecute with imprisonments, scourges, tortures, confiscations,</p>
<p>and flames, we shall indeed, like sheep destined for the
slaughter,</p>
<p>be reduced to the greatest extremities. Yet shall we in patience pos-
sess our souls, and wait for the mighty hand of the Lord . . . for
the</p>
<p>deliverance of the poor from their affliction, and for the punishment
of their despisers, who now exult in such perfect security. May the</p>
<p>Lord, the King of Kings, establish your throne with righteousness</p>
<p>and your kingdom with equity . 4</p>
<p>It is difficult for us, in an age when theology has given place to
politics as the center of human interest and conflict, to recapture the
mood in which Calvin composed the Institutes. He, much more than
Spinoza, was a God-in- toxicated man. He was overwhelmed by a sense of
man’s littleness and God’s immensity. How absurd it would be to suppose
that the frail reason of so infinitesimal a mite as man could understand
the Mind behind these in- numerable, obedient stars? In pity of man’s
reason God has revealed Himself</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) JOHN CALVIN 463</p>
<p>to us in the Bible. That this Holy Book is His Word (says Calvin) is
proved by the unrivaled impression that it makes on the human
spirit.</p>
<p>Read Demosthenes or Cicero, read Plato, Aristotle, or any others</p>
<p>of that class; I grant you that you will be attracted, delighted,
moved, and enraptured by them in a surprising manner; but if, after
reading them, you turn to the perusal of the sacred volume, whether you
are willing or unwilling, it will affect you so powerfully, it will so
pene-</p>
<p>trate your heart, and impress itself so strongly on your mind,
that,</p>
<p>compared with its energetic influence, the beauties of
rhetoricians</p>
<p>and philosophers will almost entirely disappear; so that it is easy
to</p>
<p>perceive something divine in the sacred Scriptures, which far
sur-</p>
<p>passes the highest attainments and ornaments of human industry .
5</p>
<p>Consequently this revealed Word must be our final authority, not only
in religion and morals but in history, politics, everything. We must
accept the story of Adam and Eve; for by their disobedience to God we
explain man’s evil nature and his loss of free will.</p>
<p>The mind of man is so completely alienated from the righteous-</p>
<p>ness of God that it conceives, desires, and undertakes everything
that is impious, perverse, base, impure, and flagitious. His heart is
so</p>
<p>thoroughly infected by the poison of sin that it cannot produce any-
thing but what is corrupt; and if at any time men do anything appar-
ently good, yet the mind always remains involved in hypocrisy and</p>
<p>deceit, and the heart enslaved by its inward perversity . 6</p>
<p>How could so depraved a being ever deserve eternal happiness in
paradise? Not one of us could ever earn it by any amount of good works.
Good works are good, but only the sacrificial death of the Son of God
could avail to earn salvation for men. Not for all men, for God’s
justice demands the damnation of most men. But His mercy has chosen some
of us to be saved; and to these he has given an upholding faith in their
redemption by Christ. For St. Paul said: “God the Father hath chosen us
in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
without blame before Him in love; hav- ing predestinated us unto the
adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good
pleasure of His will .” 7 Calvin, like Luther, inter - preted this to
mean that God, by a free choice quite independent of our virtues and
vices, determined, long before the creation, just who is to be saved and
who is to be damned . 8 To the question why God should choose men for
salvation or damnation without regard to their merits, Calvin answers
again in the words of Paul: “For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on
whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
compas- sion.” 9 Calvin concludes:</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>In conformity, therefore, to the clear doctrine of Scripture, we</p>
<p>assert that by an eternal and immutable counsel God has once for all
determined both whom He would admit to salvation, and whom He would
condemn to destruction. We affirm that this counsel, as far as concerns
the elect, is founded on His gratuitous mercy, totally ir-</p>
<p>respective of human merit; but that to those whom He devotes to</p>
<p>condemnation, the gate of life is closed by a just and
irreprehen-</p>
<p>sible, but incomprehensible, judgment . 10</p>
<p>Even the fall of Adam and Eve, with all its consequences, in the
Pauline theory, to the human race, “was ordained by the admirable
counsel of God .” 11</p>
<p>Calvin admits that predestination is repulsive to reason, but he
replies, “It is unreasonable that man should scrutinize with impunity
those things which the Lord has determined to be hidden in Himself .” 12
Yet he professes to know why God so arbitrarily determines the eternal
fate of billions of souls: it is “to promote our admiration of His
glory” by the display of His power . 18 He agrees that this is “a
horrible decree” (decretum horribile), “but no one can deny that God
foreknew the future final fate of man before He created him, and that He
foreknew it because it was appointed by His own dec ree .” 14 Others
might argue, like Luther, that the future is determined because God has
foreseen it and His foresight cannot be falsified; Calvin reverses the
matter, and considers that God foresees the future because He has willed
and determined it. And the decree of damnation is absolute; there is no
purgatory in Calvin’s theology, no halfway house where one might, by a
few million years of burning, wipe out his “reprobation.” And therefore
there is no room for prayers for the dead.</p>
<p>We might sup pose that on Calvin’s assumptions there would be no
sense in any kind of prayer; all being fixed by divine decree, not an
ocean of orisons could wash away one jot of the inexorable destiny.
However, Calvin is more human than his theology: let us pray with
humility and faith, he tells us, and our prayers will be answered; the
prayer and the answer were also decreed. Let us worship God in humble
religious services, but we must re- ject the Mass as a sacrilegious
pretense of priests to transform earthly ma- terials into the body and
blood of Christ. Christ is present in the Eucharist only spiritually,
not physically; and the adoration of the consecrated wafer as literally
Christ is sheer idolatry. The use of graven images of the Deity, in
clear violation of the Second Commandment, encourages idolatry. All
religious pictures and statuary, even the crucifix, should be removed
from the churches.</p>
<p>The true Church is the invisible congregation of the elect, dead,
living, or to be born. The visible Church is composed of “all those who,
by a con - fession of faith, an exemplary life, and participation in the
sacraments of</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>465</p>
<p>baptism and the Lord’s Supper” (Calvin rejects the other sacraments),
“pro - fess the same God and Christ with ourselves.” 15 Outside of this
Church there</p>
<p>It is remarkable how much of Roman Catholic tradition and theory sur-
vived in Calvin’s theology. He owed something to Stoicism, especially to
Seneca, and something to his studies of law; but his chief reliance was
on St. Augustine, who drew predestinarianism out of St. Paul, who did
not know Christ. Calvin sternly ignored Christ’s conception of God as a
loving and merciful father, and calmly passed by a multitude of Biblical
passages that assumed man’s freedom to mold his own destiny (2 Pet. 3:9;
1 Tim. 2:4; 1 John 2:2; 4 : 14, etc.). C alvin’s genius lay not in
conceiving new ideas but in developing the thought of his predecessors
to ruinously logical conclu- sions, expressing these with an eloquence
equaled only by Augustine, and formulating their practical implications
in a system of ecclesiastical legis- lation. He took from Luther the
doctrine of justification or election by faith; from Zwingli the
spiritual interpretation of the Eucharist; and from Bucer the
contradictory notions of the divine will as the cause of all events, and
the requirement of a strenuous practical piety as the test and witness
of election. Most of these Protestant doctrines had come down, in milder
form, in Catholic tradition; Calvin gave them stark emphasis, and
neglected the compensatory mitigating elements in the medieval faith. He
was more medi- eval than any thinker between Augustine and Dante. He
completely re- jected the humanist concern with earthly excellence, and
turned men’s thoughts again, more somberly than before, to the after
world. In Calvinism the Reformation again repudiated the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>That so unprepossessing a theology should have won the assent of
hundreds of millions of men in Switzerland, France, Scotland, England,
and North America is at first sight a mystery, then an illumination. Why
should Calvin- ists, Huguenots, and Puritans have fought so valiantly in
defense of their own helplessness? And why has this theory of human
impotence shared in producing some of the strongest characters in
history? Is it because these believers gained more strength from
believing themselves the few elect than</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>4 66</p>
<p>they lost by admitting that their conduct contributed nothing to
their fate? Calvin himself, at once shy and resolute, was confident that
he belonged to the elect, and this so comforted him that he found the
“horrible decree” of predestination “productive of the most delightful
benefit.” 19 Did some of the self-elect take pleasure in considering how
few were to be saved, and how many were to be damned? The belief that
they were chosen of God gave many souls the courage to face the
vicissitudes and apparent aimlessness of life, as a similar faith
enabled the Jewish people to preserve itself amid difficulties that
might otherwise have sapped the will to live; indeed, the Calvinist idea
of being divinely chosen may have been indebted to the Jewish form of
the belief, as Protestantism in general owed so much to the Old
Testament. The confidence in divine election must have been a tower of
courage to Huguenots suffering war and massacre, and to Pilgrims
uprooting themselves perilously to seek new homes on hostile shores. If
a reformed sinner could catch this confidence, and could believe that
his reform had been ordained by God, he could stand unshaken to the end.
Calvin enhanced this feeling of pride in election by making the elect,
penniless or not, an hereditary aristocracy: the children of the elect
were automatically elect by the will of God . 20 So, by a simple act of
faith in one’s self, one could, if only in imagination, possess and
transmit paradise. For such immortal boons a confession of helplessness
was a bargain price.</p>
<p>Calvin’s foll owers needed such consolation, for he taught them the
medie- val view that earthly life is a vale of misery and tears. He
cheerfully granted “the correctness of their opinion who considered it
as the greatest boon not to be born, and, as the next greatest, to die
immediately; nor was there any- thing irrational in the conduct of those
who mourned and wept at the birth of their relations, and solemnly
rejoiced at their funerals”; he merely re - gretted that these wise
pessimists, being mostly pagans ignorant of Christ, were doomed to
everlasting hell . 21 Only one thing could make life bearable- • the
hope of uninterrupted happiness after death. “If heaven is our country,
what is the earth but a place of exile? — and if the departure out of
this world is an entrance into life, what is the world but a sepulcher
?” 22 Unlike his poetical counterpart, Calvin gives his most eloquent
pages not to the phan- tasmagoria of hell but to the loveliness of
heaven. The pious elect will suffer without a murmur al l the pains and
griefs of life. “For they will keep in view that day when the Lord will
receive His faithful servants into His peaceful kingdom, will wipe every
tear from their eyes, invest them with robes of joy, adorn them with
crowns of glory, entertain them with ineffable de- lights, and exalt
them to a fellowship with His majesty, and … a participation in His
happiness .” 23 For the poor or unfortunate, who cover the earth, it may
have been an indispensable belief.</p>

<p>HI. GENEVA AND STRASBOURG: 1536-41</p>
<p>While the Institutes was in the press (March 1536), Calvin, according
to a tradition generally but not unanimously accepted, 24 made a hurried
trip across the Alps to Ferrara, probably to ask help for the persecuted
Protes- tants of France from the Protestant Duchess Renee, wife of Duke
Ercole II and daughter of the late Louis XII. Moved by the fervor of his
religious con- victions, she made him her spiritual guide through
reverent correspondence till his death. Returning to Basel in May,
Calvin ventured to Noyon to sell some property; then, with a brother and
a sister, he started for Strasbourg. War barring the road, they stopped
for a time at Geneva (July 1536).</p>
<p>The capital of French Switzerland was older than history. In
prehistoric times it was a congeries of lake dwellings, built upon
piles, some of which can still be seen. In Caesar’s day it was a busy
crossing of trade routes at the bridge where the Rhone rushes out of
Lake Leman to wander through France in search of the Mediterranean. In
the Middle Ages Geneva fell under the secular as well as spiritual rule
of its bishop. Normally the bishop was chosen by the cathedral chapter,
which thereby became a power in the city; this was essentially the
government that Calvin later restored in Protes- tant form. In the
fifteenth century the dukes of Savoy, which lay just beyond the Alps,
secured control of the chapter, and raised to the episcopate men
subservient to Savoy and given to the pleasures of this world for fear
there might not be a next. The once excellent episcopal government, and
the morals of the clergy under it, deteriorated. A priest, bidden to
dismiss his concubine, agreed to do so as soon as his fellow clergymen
would be equally ungallant; gallantry prevailed. 25</p>
<p>Within this ecclesiastical-ducal rule the leading families of Geneva
organ- ized a Council of Sixty for municipal ordinances, and the Council
chose four sy ndics as executive officers. Usually the Council met in
the bishop’s cathe - dral of St. Peter; and religious and civil
jurisdiction were so mingled that while the bishop minted the coinage
and led the army, the Council regulated morals, issued excommunications,
and licensed prostitutes. As in Trier, Mainz, and Cologne, the bishop
was also a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, and naturally assumed
functions from which bishops are now free. Some civic leaders, led by
Frangois de Bonnivard, sought to liberate the city from both the
episcopal and the ducal authority. To strengthen this movement these
Patriotes effected an alliance with Catholic Fribourg and Protestant
Bern. Adherents of the alliance were called by the German term for con-
federates — Eidgenossen, oath comrades; the French corrupted this into
Hu- guenots. By 1520 the Genevese leaders were mostly businessmen, for
Geneva, unlike Wittenberg, was a commercial city, mediating in trade
be-</p>

<p>^••een Switzerland on the north, Italy on the south, and France on
the west. The Genevese burghers set up (1526) a Great Council of Two
Hundred, and this chose a Small Council of Twenty-Five, which became the
real ruler of the municipality, frequently flouting the authority of
bishop and duke alike. The bishop declared the city in rebellion, and
summoned ducal troops to his aid. These seized Bonnivard, and imprisoned
him in the castle of Chillon. The Bernese army came to the aid of
beleaguered Geneva; the duke’s forces were defeated and dispersed; the
bishop fled to Annecy; By - ron’s hero was freed from his dungeon. The
Great Council, angered by the clergy’s support of Savoy, declared f or
the Reformed faith, and assumed ecclesiastical as well as civil
jurisdiction throughout the city (1536), two months before Calvin
arrived.</p>
<p>The doctrinal hero of this revolution was William Farel. Like Luther,
he was passionately pious in youth. At Paris he came under the influence
of Jacques Lefevre d’Etaples, whose translation and explanation of the
Bible upset Farel’s orthodoxy; for in the Scriptures he could find no
trace of popes, bishops, indulgences, purgatory, seven sacraments, the
Mass, the celibacy of the clergy, the worship of Mary or the saints.
Disdaining ordi- nation, he set out as an independent preacher,
wandering from town to town in France and Switzerland. Small of stature,
weak of frame, strong of voice and spirit, his pale face brightened by
fiery eyes and a beard of flaming red, he denounced the pope as
Antichrist, the Mass as sacrilege, the church icons as idola that must
be destroyed. In 1532 he began to preach in Geneva. He was arrested by
the bishop’s agents, who proposed to throw the “Lutheran dog” into the
Rhone; the syndics intervened, and Farel escaped with a few bruises on
his head and some spittle on his coat. He won the Council of Twenty-Five
to his views, and, with the aid of Peter Viret and Antoine Froment,
aroused so much popular support that nearly all the Catholic clergy
departed. On May 21, 1536, the Small Council decreed the abolition of
the Mass, and the removal of all images and relics from the churches.
Ecclesi- astical properties were converted to Protestant uses for
religion, charity, and education; education was made compulsory and free
of chaige; and a strict moral discipline was made law. The citizens were
called upon to swear allegiance to the Gospel, and those who refused to
attend Reformed services were banished. 26 This was the Geneva to which
Calvin came.</p>
<p>Farel was now forty-seven; and though he was destined to outlive
Calvin by a year, he saw in the stern and eloquent youth, twenty years
his junior, just the man needed to consolidate and advance the Reform.
Calvin was reluctant; he had planned a life of scholarship and writing;
he was more at ease with God than with men. But Farel, with the mien of
some thundering Biblical prophet, threatened to lay a holy curse upon
him if he should prefer his private studies to the arduous and dangerous
preaching of the undiluted</p>

<p>Word. Calvin yielded; Council and presbytery approved; and — with no
other ordination — he began his ministry (September 5, 1536) by giving
in the church of St. Peter the first of several addresses on the
Epistles of St. Paul. Everywhere in Protestantism, except among the
socially radical sects, the influence of Paul overshadowed that of
Peter, the reputed founder of the Roman See.</p>
<p>In October Calvin accompanied Farel and Viret to Lausanne, and took a
minor part in the famous disputation that won that city to the
Protestant camp. Returning to Geneva, the senior and junior pastors of
St. Peter’s set about to rededicate the Genevese to God. Sincerely
accepting the Bible as the literal Word of God, they felt an inescapable
obligation to enforce its moral code. They were shocked to find many of
the people given to sing- ing, dancing, and similar gaieties; moreover,
some gambled, or drank to in- toxication, or committed adultery. An
entire district of the city was occupied by prostitutes, under the rule
of their own Reine du bordel, the Brothel Queen. To the fiery Farel and
the conscientious Calvin a genial acceptance of this situation was
treason to God.</p>
<p>To restore the religious basis of an effective morality, Farel issued
a Con- fession of Faith and Discipline, and Calvin a popular Catechism,
which the Great Council approved (November 1536). Citizens persistently
trans- gressing the moral code were to be excommunicated and exiled. In
July 1537, the Council ordered all citizens to go to the church of
St. Peter and swear allegiance to Farel’s Confession. Any manifestation
of Catholicism— such as carrying a rosary, cherishing a sacred relic, or
observing a saint’s day as holy — was subject to punishment. Women were
imprisoned for wearing im- proper hats. Bonnivard, too joyous in his
liberty, was warned to end his licentious ways. Gamblers were put into
the stocks. Adulterers were driven through the streets into
banishment.</p>
<p>Accustomed to ecclesiastical rule, but to the lenient moral
discipline of a Catholicism softened by southern climes, the Genevese
resisted the new dis- pensation. The Patriotes, who had freed the city
from bishop and duke, re- organized to free it from its zealous
ministers. Another party, demanding liberty of conscience and worship,
and therefore called Libertins or Liber- als,* joined with the Patriotes
and the secret Catholics; and this coalition, in the election of
February 3, 1538, captured a majority in the Great Council. The new
Council told the ministers to keep out of politics. Farel and Calvin
denounced the Council, and refused to serve the Lord’s Supper until the
rebellious city conformed to the sworn discipline. The Council deposed
the two ministers (April 23), and ordered them to leave the city within
three days. The people celebrated the dismissal with public rejoicings.
27 Farel ac-</p>
<p>Calvin. by charging them with moral laxity, gave the word libertine
its new connotation.</p>
<p>470 “THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>cepted a call to Neuchatel; there he preached to the end of his days
( 1 565), and there a public monument honors his memory.</p>
<p>Calvin went to Strasbourg, then a free city subject only to the
emperor, and ministered to L’Eglise des Etrangers, a congregat ion of
Protestants chiefly from France. To eke out the fifty-two guilders
(,300?) annually paid him by the church, he sold his library and took
students as boarders. Finding bachelorhood inconvenient in this
situation, he asked Farel and Bucer to sea rch out a wife for him, and
listed specifications: “I am none of those in - sane lovers who, when
once smitten with the fine figure of a woman, em- brace also her faults.
This only is the beauty which allures me — that she be chaste, obliging,
not fastidious, economical, patient, and careful for my health.” 28
After two false starts he married ( 1 540) Idelette de Bure, a poor
widow with several children. She bore him one child, who died in
infancy. When she passed away (1549) he wrote of her with the private
tenderness that underlay his public severity. He lived in domestic
loneliness the remain- ing fifteen years of his life.</p>
<p>While he labored in Strasbourg events moved on at Geneva. Encouraged
by the expulsion of Farel and Calvin, the exiled bishop planned a
triumphant return to his cathedral. As a preliminary step he persuaded
Iacopo Sadoleto to write an Epistle to the Genevese , urging them to
resume their Catholic worship and faith (1539). Sadoleto was a gentleman
of exceptional virtue for a cardinal and a humanist; he had already
advised the papacy to handle Protestant dissent gently, and he later
received under his protection at Car- pentras heretical Waldenses
fleeing from massacre (1545). In a fine Latin learned under the
impeccable Bembo, he addressed “to his dearly beloved Brethren, the
Magistrates, Senate, and citizens of Geneva,” twenty pages of diplomatic
courtesies and theological exhortation. He noted the rapid divi- sion of
Protestantism into warring sects, led, he alleged, by crafty men avid
for power; he compared this with the centuries-long unity of the Roman
Church, and asked whether it was more likely that truth lay with those
contradictory factions than with a Catholic doctrine formed by the
experi- ence of ages and the assembled intelligence of ecclesiastical
councils. He con- cluded by offering to Geneva whatever service it was
in his power to give.</p>
<p>The Council thanked him for his compliments, and promised him a
further response. But no one could be found in Geneva who would
undertake to cross swords, or Latin, with the polished humanist.
Meanwhile a number of citizens asked to be released from their oath to
support the Confession of Faith and Discipline, and for a time it seemed
that the city would return to Catholicism. Caivin learned of the
situation, and in a reply to the Cardinal he rose with all the power of
his mind and pen to the defense of the Ref- ormation. He countered
courtesy with courtesy, eloquence with eloquence, but he would not yield
an inch of his theology. He protested against the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) JOHN CALVIN 471</p>
<p>implication that he had rebelled through personal ambition; he could
have risen to far greater comfort had he remained orthodox. He admitted
the divine foundation of the Catholic Church, but he charged that the
vices of the Renaissance popes proved the capture of the papacy by
Antichrist. To the wisdom of Church councils he opposed the wisdom of
the Bible, which Sadoleto had almost ignored. He regretted that the
corruption of the Church had necessitated secession and division, but
only so could the evils be cured. If Catholics and Protestants would now
co-operate to cleanse the doctrine, ritual, and personnel of all the
Christian churches, they would be rewarded with a final unity in heaven
with Christ. It was a powerful letter, perhaps unappreciative of the
incidental virtues of the Renaissance popes, but other- wise phrased
with a comity and dignity rare in the controversies of the time. Luther,
reading it in Wittenberg, hailed it as quite annihilating the Cardinal;
“I rejoice,” he cried, “that God raises up men who will . . . finish the
war against Antichrist which I began.” 29 The Council of Geneva was so
im - pressed that it ordered t he two letters printed at the city’s
expense (1540). It began to wonder whether, in banishing Calvin, it had
lost the ablest man in the Swiss Reform.</p>
<p>Other factors nourished the doubt. The ministers who had replaced
Farel and Calvin proved incompetent both in preaching and in discipline.
The public lost respect for them, and returned to the easy morality of
unreformed days. Gambling, drunkenness, street brawls, adultery,
flourished; lewd songs were publicly sung, persons romped naked through
the streets. 30 Of the four syndics who had led the movement to expel
Farel and Calvin, one had to be condemned to death for murder, another
for forgery, a third for treason, and the fourth died while trying to
escape arrest. The businessmen who con- trolled the Council must have
frowned upon this disorder as impeding trade. The Council itself had no
taste for being replaced and perhaps ex- communicated by a restored
bishop. Gradually a majority of the members came to the idea of
recalling Calvin. On May 1, 1541, the Council annulled the sentence of
banishment, and pronounced Farel and Calvin to be honor- able men.
Deputation after deputation was sent to Strasbourg to persuade Calvin to
resume his pastorate at Geneva. Farel forgave the city for not ex-
tending him a similar invitation, and with noble generosity joined the
depu- tations in urging Calvin to return. But Calvin had made many
friends in Strasbourg, felt obligations there, and saw nothing but
strife in store for him at Geneva; “there is no place in the world that
I fear more.” He agreed only to pay the city a visit. When he arrived
(September 13,1 541 ) he received so many honors, so many apologies, so
many promises of co-operation in re- establishing order and the Gospel,
that he had not the heart to refuse. On September 16 he wrote to Farel:
“Your wish is granted. I am held fast here. May God give His blessirg.”

<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE CITY OF GOD</li>
</ol>
<p>Calvin behaved, in the early years of his recall, with a moderation
and modesty that won all but a small minority to his support. Eight
assistant pastors were appointed, under him, to serve St. Peter’s and
the other churches of the city. He labored twelve to eighteen hours a
day as preacher, ad- ministrator, professor of theology, superintendent
of churches and schools, adviser to municipal councils, and regulator of
public morals and church liturgy; meanwhile he kept enlarging the
Institutes, wrote commentaries on the Bible, and maintained a
correspondence second in extent only to that of Erasmus, and surpassing
it in influence. He slept little, ate little, fasted fre- quently. His
successor and biographer, Theodore de Beze, marveled that one little man
( unicus homunculus) could carry so heavy and varied a bur- den.</p>
<p>His first task was the reorganization of the Reformed Church. At his
re- quest the Small Council, soon after his return, appointed a
commission of five clergymen and six councilors, with Calvin at their
head, to formulate a new ecclesiastical code. On January 2, 1542, the
Great Council ratified the resultant Ordonnances ecclesiastiques, whose
essential features are still ac- cepted by the Reformed and Presbyterian
churches of Europe and America. The ministry was divided into pastors,
teachers, lay elders, and deacons. The pastors of Geneva constituted
“The Venerable Company,” which governed the Church and trained
candidates for the ministry. No one henceforth was to preach in Geneva
without authorization by the Company; the consent of the city council
and the congregation was also required, but episcopal ordi- nations —
and bishops — were taboo. The new clergy, while never claiming the
miraculous powers of the Catholic priests, and though decreeing them-
selves ineligible for civil office, became under Calvin more powerful
than any priesthood since ancient Israel. The real law of a Christian
state, said Calvin, must be the Bible; the clergy are the proper
interpreters of that law; civil governments are subject to that law, and
must enforce it as so inter- preted. The practical men in the councils
may have had some doubts on these points, but they appear to have felt
that social order was so profitable to the economy that some
ecclesiastical assumptions might for the time being go unchallenged.
Through an astonishing quarter of a century a theocracy of clergymen
seemed to dominate an oligarchy of merchants and men of affairs.</p>
<p>The authority of the clergy over Genevese life was exercised through
a Consistory or Presbytery composed of five pastors and twelve lay
elders, all chosen by the Council. As the pastors held tenure throughout
their ministry, and the elders for only a year, the Consistory, in
matters not vitally affecting business, was ruled by its ecclesiastical
members. It took the right</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>to ordain the religious worship and moral conduct of every
inhabitant; it sent a minister and an elder to visit every house and
family annually; it could summon any person before it for examination;
it could publicly re- prove or excommunicate offenders, and could rely
on the Council to banish from the city those whom the Consistory banned
from the Church. Calvin held power as the head of this Consistory; from
1541 till his death in 1564 his voice was the most influential in
Geneva. His dictatorship was one not of law or force but of will and
character. The intensity of his belief in his mis - sion, and the
completeness of his devotion to his tasks, gave him a strength that no
one could successfully resist. Hildebrand, revived, could have re-
joiced over this apparent triumph of the Church over the state.</p>
<p>So empowered, the clergy first regulated religious worship. “The
whole household shall attend the sermons on Sunday, except when someone
shall be left at home to tend the children or the cattle. If there is
preaching on weekdays all who can must come.” (Calvin preached three or
four times a week.) “Should anyone come after the sermon has begun, let
him be warned. If he does not amend, let him pay a fine of three sous.”
32 No one was to be excused from Protestant services on the plea of
having a different or private religious creed; Calvin was as thorough as
any pope in rejecting individual- ism of belief; this greatest
legislator of Protestantism completely repudiated that principle of
private judgment with which the new religion had begun. He had seen the
fragmentation of the Reformation into a hundred sects, and foresaw more;
in Geneva he would have none of them. There a body of learned divines
would formulate an authoritative creed; those Genevans who could not
accept it would have to seek other habitats. Persistent absence from
Protestant services, or continued refusal to take the Eucharist, was a
punish- able offense. Heresy again became an insult to God and treason
to the state, and was to be punished with death. Catholicism, which had
preached this view of heresy, became heresy in its turn. Between 1 542
and 1564 fifty-eight persons were put to death, and seventy-six were
banished, for violating the new code. Here, as elsewhere, witchcraft was
a capital crime; in one year, on the advice of the Consistory, fourteen
alleged witches were sent to the stake on the charge that they had
persuaded Satan to afflict Geneva with plague. 38</p>
<p>The Consistory made little distinction between religion and morality.
Conduct was to be guided as carefully as belief, for good conduct was
the goal of right belief. Calvin himself, austere and severe, dreamed of
a com- munity so well regulated that its virtue would prove his
theology, and would shame the Catholicism that had produced or tolerated
the luxury and laxity of Rome. Discipline should be the backbone of
personality, enabling it to rise out of the baseness of human nature to
the erect stature of the self -con- quered man. The clergy must lead by
example as well as precept; they may</p>
<p>474 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>marry and beget, but they must abstain from hunting, gambling,
feasting, commerce, and secular amusements, and accept annual visitation
and moral scrutiny by their ecclesiastical superiors.</p>
<p>To regulate lay conduct a system of domiciliary visits was
established: one or another of the elders visited, yearly, each house in
the quarter assigned to him, and questioned the occupants on all phases
of their lives. Consistory and Council joined in the prohibition of
gambling, card-playing, profanity, drunkenness, the frequenting of
taverns, dancing (which was then enhanced by kisses and embraces),
indecent or irreligious songs, excess in entertain- ment, extravagance
in living, immodesty in dress. The allowable color and quantity of
clothing, and the number of dishes permissible at a meal, were specified
by law. Jewelry and lace were frowned upon. A woman was jailed for
arranging her hair to an immoral height. 34 Theatrical performances were
limited to religious plays, and then these too were forbidden. Children
were to be named not after saints in the Catholic calendar but
preferably after Old Testament characters; an obstinate father served
four days in prison for insisting on naming his son Claude instead of
Abraham. 85 Censorship of the press was taken over from Catholic and
secular precedents, and enlarged ( 1 560) : books of erroneous religious
doctrine, or of immoral tendency, were banned; Montaigne’s Essays and
Rousseau’s Emile were later to fall under this proscription. To speak
disrespectfully of Calvin or the clergy was a crime. 36 A first
violation of these ordinances was punished with a reprimand, further
violation with fines, persistent violation with imprisonment or banish-
ment. Fornication was to be punished with exile or drowning; adultery,
blasphemy, or idolatry, with death. In one extraordinary instance a
child was beheaded for striking its parents. 37 In the years 1558-59
there were 414 prosecutions for moral offenses; between 1 542 and 1 564
there were seventy- six banishments and fifty-eight executions; the
total population of Geneva was then about 20,ooo. 38 As everywhere in
the sixteenth century, torture was often used to obtain confessions or
evidence.</p>
<p>Regulation was extended to education, society, and the economic life.
Calvin established schools and an academy, searched through Western Eu-
rope for good teachers of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and theology, and
trained young ministers who carried his gospel into France, Holland,
Scotland, and England with all the ardor and devotion of Jesuit
missionaries in Asia; in eleven years (1555-66) Geneva sent 161 such
envoys into France, many of whom sang Huguenot psalms as they suffered
martyrdom. Calvin considered class divisions natural, and his
legislation protected rank and dignity by pre- scribing the quality of
dress, and the limits of activity for each class. 39 Every person was
expected to accept his place in society, and to perform its duties
without envy of his betters or complaint of his lot. Begging was banned,
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) JOHN CALVIN 475</p>
<p>indiscriminate charity was replaced by careful communal
administration of poor relief.</p>
<p>Calvinism gave to hard work, sobriety, diligence, frugality, and
thrift a religious sanction and laurel that may have shared in
developing the indus- trious temper of the modem Protestant businessman;
but this relationship has been overstressed. 40 Capitalism was more
highly developed in Catholic Florence and Flanders before the
Reformation than in Calvin’s Geneva. Calvin rejected individualism in
economics as well as in religion and morals. The unit of society, in his
view, was not the free individual (with whom Luther had begun his
revolt) but the city-state community, whose members were bound to it in
rigorous law and discipline. “No member of the Christian community,” he
wrote, “holds his gifts to himself, or for his priva te use, but shares
them among his fellow members; nor does he derive benefit save from
those things which proceed from the common profit of the body as a
whole.” 41 He had no sympathy with acquisitive speculation or ruthless
ac - cumulation. 42 Like some late-medieval Catholic theorists, he
permitted interest on loans, but in theory he limited it to 5 per cent,
and urged loans without interest to necessitous individuals or the
state. 43 With his approval the Consistory punished engrossers,
monopolists, and lenders who charged excessive interest; it fixed prices
for food and clothes and surgical operations; it censured or fined
merchants who defrauded their clients, dealers who skimped their
measures, clothiers who cut their cloth too short. 44 Sometimes the
regime moved toward state socialism: the Venerable Company estab- lished
a bank, and conducted some industries. 45</p>
<p>If we bear these limiting factors in mind, we may admit a quiet and
grow- ing entente between Calvinism and business. Calvin could not long
have kept his leadership had he obstructed the commercial development of
a city whose commerce was its life. He adjusted himself to the
situation, allowed interest charges of 10 per cent, and recommended
state loans to finance the introduction or expansion of private
industry, as in the manufacture of clothing or the production of silk.
Commercial centers like Antwerp, Am- sterdam, and London took readily to
the first modern religion that accepted the modern economy. Calvinism
took the middle classes into its fold, and grew with their growth.</p>
<p>What were the results of Calvin’s rule? The difficulties of
enforcement must have been extreme, for never in history had such strict
virtue been re- quired of a city. A considerable party opposed the
regimen, even to the point of open revolt, but a substantial number of
influential citizens must have sup- ported it, if only on the general
theory of morals — that others need them. The influx of French Huguenots
and other Protestants must have strength- ened Calvin’s hand; and the
limitation of the experiment to Geneva and its hinterland raised the
chances of success. The recurrent fear of invasion and</p>
<p>476 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>absorption by hostile states (Savoy, Italy, France, the Empire)
compelled political stability and civic obedience; external danger
promoted internal discipline. In any case we have an enthusiastic
description of the results from the pen of an eyewitness, Bernardino
Ochino, an Italian Protestant who had found refuge in Geneva:</p>
<p>Cursing and swearing, unchastity, sacrilege, adultery, and impure</p>
<p>living, such as prevail in many places where I have lived, are
here</p>
<p>unknown. There are no pimps and harlots. The people do not know</p>
<p>what rouge is, and they are all clad in seemly fashion. Games of</p>
<p>chance are not customary. Benevolence is so great that the poor need
not beg. The people admonish one another in brotherly fashion, as</p>
<p>Christ prescribes. Lawsuits are banished from the city, nor is
there</p>
<p>any simony, murder, or party spirit, but only peace and charity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are no organs here, no voice of bells,
no</p>
<p>showy songs, no burning candles or lamps 〔in the churches〕, no</p>
<p>relics, pictures, statues, canopies, or splendid robes, no farces or
cold ceremonies. The churches are quite free from idolatry . 46</p>
<p>The extant records of the Council for this period do not quite agree
with this report: they reveal a high percentage of illegitimate
children, aban- doned infants, forced marriages, and sentences of death;
47 Calvin’s son -in- law and his stepdaughter were among those condemned
for adultery. 48 But then again, as late as 1610, we find Valentin
Andreae, a Lutheran minister from Wiirttemberg, praising Geneva
enviously:</p>
<p>When I was in Geneva I observed something great which I shall</p>
<p>remember and desire as long as I live. There is in that city not
only</p>
<p>the perfect institute of a perfect republic, but, as a special
ornament, a moral discipline which makes weekly investigations into the
con-</p>
<p>duct, and even the smallest transgressions, of the citizens. . . .

<p>V. THE CONFLICTS OF CALVIN</p>
<p>Calvin’s character harmonized with his theology. The oil painting in
the University Library at Geneva pictures him as a severe and somber
mystic; dark but bloodless complexion, scanty black beard, high
forehead, penetrat- ing, ruthless eyes. He was short and thin and
physically frail, hardly fit to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) JOHN CALVIN 477</p>
<p>carry a city in his hands. But behind the weak frame burned a mind
sharp, narrow, devoted, and intense, and a firm, indomitable will,
perhaps a will to power. His intellect was a citadel of order, making
him almost the Aquinas of Protestant theology. His memory was crowded
and yet precise. He was ahead of his time in doubting astrology, abreast
of it in rejecting Copernicus, a bit behind it (like Luther) in
ascribing many terrestrial occurrences to the Devil. His timidity
concealed his courage, his shyness disguised an inner pride, his
humility before God became at times a commanding arrogance before men.
He was painfully sensitive to criticism, and could not bear opposition
with the patience of one who can conceive the possibility that he may be
wrong. Racked with illness, bent with work, he often lost his temper and
broke out into fits of angry eloquence; he confessed to Bucer that he
found it difficult to tame “the wild beast of his wrath.” 50 His virtues
did not include humor, which might have softened his certainties, nor a
sense of beauty, which might have spared ecclesiastical art. Yet he was
no unmiti- gated kill-joy; he bade his followers be cheerful, play
harmless games like bowling or quoits, and enjoy wine in moderation. He
could be a kind and tender friend, and an unforgiving enemy, capable of
hard judgments and stem revenge. Those who served him feared him, 61 but
those loved him most who knew him best. Sexually his life showed no
fault. He lived simply, ate sparingly, fasted unostentatiously, slept
only six hours a day, never took a holiday, used himself up without
stint in what he thought was the service of God. He refused increases in
salary, but labored to raise funds for the relief of the poor. “The
strength of that heretic,” said Pope Pius IV, “consisted in this, that
money never had the slightest charm for him. If I had such servants my
dominion would extend from sea to sea.” 62</p>
<p>A man of such mettle must raise many enemies. He fought them with
vigor, and in the controversial language of the time. He described his
oppo- nents as riffraff, idiots, dogs, asses, pigs, and stinking beasts
B3 — epithets less becoming to his elegant Latinity than to Luther’s
gladiatorial style. But he had provocations. One day Jerome Bolsec, an
ex-monk from France, inter- rupted Calvin’s sermon at St. Peter’s to
denounce the predestinarian doctrine as an insult to God; Calvin
answered him by citing Scripture; the police arrested Bolsec; the
Consistory charged him with heresy; the Council was inclined to put him
to death. But when the opinions of theologians in Zurich, Basel, and
Bern were solicited, they proved disconcerting: Bern recom- mended
caution in dealing with problems beyond human ken — a new note in the
literature of the age; and Bullinger warned Calvin that “many are dis -
pleased with what you say in your Institutes about predestination, and
draw the same conclusions as Bolsec.” 54 The Council compromised on
banishment &lt;1551). Bolsec returned to France and Catholicism.</p>
<p>More important in result was Calvin’s controversy with Joachim

<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>phal. This Lutheran minister of Hamburg denounced as “Satanic blasphe
- mies” the view of Zwingli and Calvin that Christ was only spiritually
present in the Eucharist, and thought the Swiss Reformers should be
refuted not by the pens of theologians but by the rods of magistrates
(1552). Calvin an- swered him in terms so severe that his fellow
Reformers at Zurich, Basel, and Bern refused to sign his remonstrance.
He issued it nevertheless; Westphal and other Lutherans returned to the
attack; Calvin branded them as “apes of Luther,” and argued so
effectively that several regions hitherto Lutheran— Brandenburg, the
Palatinate, and parts of Hesse, Bremen, Anhalt, and Baden — were won to
the Swiss view and the Reformed Church; only the silence of Melanchthon
(who secretly agreed with Calvin), and the post-mortem echo of Luther’s
thunderbolts saved the rest of northern Germany for the Lutheran
creed.</p>
<p>Turning from these assaults on the right, Calvin faced on the left a
group of radicals recently arrived in Switzerland from Counter
Reformation Italy. Caelius Secundus Curio, teaching in Lausanne and
Basel, shocked Calvin by announcing that the saved — including many
heathen — would far outnumber the damned. Laelius Socinus, son of a
leading Italian jurist, settled in Zurich, studied Greek, Arabic, and
Hebrew in order to understand the Bible better, learned too much, and
lost his faith in the Trinity, predestination, original sin, and the
atonement. He expressed his skepticism to Calvin, who answered as well
as possible. Socinus agreed to refrain from public utterance of his
doubts; but later he spoke out against the execution of Servetus, and
was among the few who, in that fevered age, stood up for religious
toleration.</p>
<p>In a state where religion and government were fused in an
intoxicating mixture, it was natural that Calvin’s most persistent
conflicts should be with</p>
<p>On June 27, 1547, Calvin found attached to his pulpit a placard
reading:</p>
<p>Gross hypocrite! You and your companions will gain little by your</p>
<p>pains. If you do not save yourselves by flight, nobody shall
prevent</p>
<p>your overthrow, and you will curse the hour when you left your</p>
<p>monkery. . . . After people have suffered long they avenge
themselves. . . . Take care that you are not served like M. Verle 〔who
had been</p>
<p>killed〕. … We will not have so many masters. . . , 55</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>479</p>
<p>Jacques Gruet, a leading Libertin, was arrested on suspicion of
having writ- ten the placard; no proof was adduced. It was claimed that
he had, some days previously, uttered threats against Calvin. In his
room were found papers, allegedly in his handwriting, calling Calvin a
haughty and ambitious hypo- crite, and ridiculing the inspiration of the
Scriptures and the immortality of the soul. He was tortured twice daily
for thirty days until he confessed — we do not know how truthfully —
that he had affixed the placard and conspired with French agents against
Calvin and Geneva. On July 26, half dead, he was tied to a stake, his
feet were nailed to it, and his head was cut off. 66</p>
<p>Tension mounted until, on December 16, 1 547, the Patriotes and
Libertins came armed to a meeting of the Great Council, and demanded an
end to the power of the Consistory over the citizens. At the height of a
violent tumult Calvin entered the room, faced the hostile leaders, and
said, striking his breast: “If you want blood, there are still a few
drops here; strike, then!” Swords were drawn, but no one ventured to be
the first assassin. Calvin addressed the gathering with rare moderation,
and finally persuaded all par- ties to a truce. Nevertheless his
confidence in himself was shaken. On De- cember 17 he wrote to Viret: “I
hardly hope that the Church can be upheld much longer, at least by my
ministry. Believe me, my power is broken, un- less God stretch forth His
hand.” But the opposition divided into factions, and subsided till the
trial of Servetus offered another opportunity.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MICHAEL SERVETUS: 15H-53</li>
</ol>
<p>Miguel Serveto was born at Villanova (some sixty miles north of Sara-
gossa), son of a notary of good family. He grew up at a time when the
writings of Erasmus were enjoying a transitory tolerance in Spain. He
was in some measure influenced by the literature of the Jews and the
Moslems; he read the Koran, made his way through rabbinical
commentaries, and was impressed by the Semitic criticism of Christianity
(with its prayers to a Trinity, to Mary, and to saints) as polytheistic.
Luther called him “the Moor.” At Toulouse, where he studied law, he saw
for the first time a com- plete Bible, vowed to read it “a thousand
times,” and was deeply moved by the visions of the Apocalypse. He won
the patronage of Juan de Quintana, confessor to Charles V, and was taken
by Juan to Bologna and Augsburg (1530). Michael discovered
Protestantism, and liked it; he visited Oeco- lampadius at Basel, and
Capito and Bucer at Strasbourg; soon he was too heretical for their
taste, and was invited to graze in other fields.</p>
<p>In 1531 and 1532 he published the first and second edition of his
basic work, De Trinitatis erroribus. It was rather confused, and in a
crude Latin that must have made Calvin smile if ever; but in wealth of
Biblical erudition</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>480</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>it was an astonishing performance for a lad of twenty. Jesus, in
Servetus’s view, was a man into whom God the Father had breathed the
Logos, the Divine Wisdom; in this sense Jesus became the Son of God; but
he was not equal or co-eternal with the Father, Who might communicate
the same spirit of wisdom to other men; “the Son was sent from the
Father in no other way than as one of the Prophets.” 57 This was pretty
close to Mohammed’s conception of Christ. Servetus proceeded to take the
Semitic view of Trini- tarianism. “All those who believe in a Trinity in
the essence of God are tritheists”; and, he added, they are “true
atheists” as deniers of the One God. 88 This was youthfully extreme, but
Servetus tried to soften his heresy by inditing rhapsodies on Christ as
the Light of the World; most of his readers, however, felt that he had
extinguished the light. As if to leave no stone unhurled, he concurred
with the Anabaptists that baptism should be given only to adults.
Oecolampadius and Bucer repudiated him, and Servetus, reversing Calvin’s
itinerary, fled from Switzerland to France (1532).</p>
<p>On July 17 the Inquisition at Toulouse issued a warrant for his
arrest. He thought of going to America, but found Paris more agreeable.
There, dis- guising himself as Michel de Villeneuve (the family name),
he studied mathematics, geography, astronomy, and medicine, and flirted
with astrol- ogy. The great Vesalius was his fellow student in
dissection, and their teachers praised them equally. He quarreled with
the dean of the medical faculty, and seems in general to have given
offense by his impetuosity, pas- sion, and pride. He challenged Calvin
to a debate, but did not appear at the appointed place and time (1534).
In the furore over Cop’s address and th e heretical placards, Servetus,
like Calvin, left Paris. At Lyons he edited a scholarly edition of
Ptolemy’s Geography. In 1540 he moved to Vienne (sixteen miles south of
Lyons), and there he lived till his last year, practicing medicine and
scholarship. Out of so many scholars available to the Lyons
publishers-printers, he was chosen to edit a Latin translation of the
Bible by Santes Pagnini. The work took him three years, and ran to six
volumes. In a note on Isaiah 7 : 14, wh ich Jerome had rendered “a
virgin shall conceive,” Servetus explained that the Hebrew word meant
not virgin but young woman, and he suggested that it referred not
prophetically to Mary but simply to Hezekiah’s wife. In the same spirit
he indicated that other seem- ingly prophetic passages in the Old
Testament referred only to contempo- rary figures or events. This proved
disconcerting to Protestants and Catholics alike.</p>
<p>We do not know when Servetus discovered the pulmonary circulation of
the blood — the passage of the blood from the right chamber of the heart
along the pulmonary artery to and through the lungs, its purification
there by aeration, and its return via the pulmonary vein to the left
chamber of the heart. So far as is now known, he did not publish his
finding till 1553, when</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>he included it in his final work, The Restitution of Christianity. He
brought the theory into a theological treatise because he thought of the
blood as the vital spirit in man, and therefore — more probably than the
heart or the brain —the real seat of the soul. Deferring for a while the
problem of Servetus’s priority in this discovery, we merely note that he
had apparently completed the Christianismi restitutio by 1 546, for in
that year he sent the manuscript to Calvin.</p>
<p>The very title was a challenge to the man who had written the
Christianae religioms institutio; but further, the book sharply
rejected, as blasphemy, the notion that God had predestined souls to
hell regardless of their merits or guilt. God, said Servetus, condemns
no one who does not condemn himself. Faith is good, but love is better,
and God Himself is love. Calvin thought it sufficient refutation of all
this to send Servetus a copy of the Institutes. Servetus returned it
with insulting annotations, 59 and followed up with a series of letters
so contemptuous that Calvin wrote to Farel (February 13,</p>
<ol start="1546" type="1">
<li>: “Servetus has just sent me a long volume of his ravings. If I
consent he will come here, but I will not give my word, for should he
come, if my authority is of any avail, I will not suffer him to get out
alive.” 80 Servetus, angry at Calvin’s refusal to continue the
correspondence, wrote to Abel Poupin, one of the Genevese ministers (
1547) :</li>
</ol>
<p>Your gospel is without God, without true faith, without good</p>
<p>works. Instead of a God you have a three-headed Cerberus 〔the</p>
<p>predestinating Trinity?〕. For faith you have a deterministic
dream.</p>
<p>. . . Man is with you an inert trunk, and God is a chimera of the
en-</p>
<p>slaved will. … You close the Kingdom of Heaven before men. . . .</p>
<p>Woe! woe! woe! This is the third letter that I have written to
warn</p>
<p>you, that you may know better. I will not warn you again. In this</p>
<p>fight of Michael I know that I shall certainly die . . . but I do
not</p>
<p>falter. . . . Christ will come. He will not tarry. 61</p>
<p>Obviously Servetus was a bit more insane than the average of his
time. He announced that the end of the world was at hand, that the
Archangel Michael would lead a holy war against both the papal and the
Genevese Antichrists, and that he, who had been named after the
Archangel, would fight and die in that war. 62 The Restitutio was a call
to that war. No wonder it had diffi- culty finding a publisher. The
Basel printers shied away from it. Finally (January 3, 1553) it was
clandestinely printed in Vienne by Balthasar Ar- nouillet and Guillaume
Gueroult. Their names, and the place of publication, were omitted, and
the author signed himself only as MSV. He paid all the expenses,
corrected the proofs, and then destroyed the manuscript. TKa volume ran
to 734 pages, for it included a revised form of De Trinitatis erroribus,
and Servetus’s thirty letters to Calv in.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Of the thousand copies printed some were sent to a bookseller in
Geneva. There one came into the hands of Guillaume Trie, a friend of
Calvin’s. The thirty letters made plain to Calvin that MSV stood for
Michael Servetus of Villanova. On February 26, 1553, Trie wrote to a
Catholic cousin in Lyons, Antoine Ameys, expressing surprise that
Cardinal Francois de Tournon should allow such a book to be printed in
his diocese. How did Trie know the place of publication? Calvin knew
that Servetus was living in Lyons or Vienne.</p>
<p>Ameys brought the matter to Matthias Ory, inquisitor at Lyons.
Ory</p>
<p>notified the Cardinal, who ordered Maugiron, Lieutenant-Governor of
Vienne, to investigate. On March 16 Servetus was summoned to Maugiron’s
house. Before obeying he destroyed all papers that might incriminate
him. He denied having written the book. Ameys dispatched to Trie a
request for more evidence of Servetus’ s authorship. Trie obtained from
Calvin some of Servetus’s letters, and sent them to Lyons. They tallied
with several letters in the book. On April 4 Servetus was arrested.
Three days later he escaped by leaping over a garden wall. On June 17
the civil court of Vienne con- demned him, if found, to be burned alive
by a slow fire.</p>
<p>Servetus wandered about France for three months. He decided to seek
refuge in Naples, and to go via Geneva. For reasons unknown he remained
in Geneva a month, under an assumed name; and meanwhile he arranged for
transportation to Zurich. On Sunday, August 13, he attended church,
perhaps to avoid investigation by the authorities. He was recognized.
Calvin was informed, and ordered his arrest. Calvin explained this
action in a later letter (September 9, 1553): “When the papists are so
harsh and violent in defense of their superstitions that they rage
cruelly to shed innocent blood, are not Christian magistrates shamed to
show themselves less ardent in de- fense of the sure truth?” The Small
Council followed Calvin’s lead, and outran his ferocity. Since Servetus
was only a transient, and not a citizen subject to the laws of Geneva,
the Council could not legally do more than banish him.</p>
<p>He was confined in the former episcopal palace, now a prison. He was
not tortured, except by the lice that infested his cell. He was allowed
paper and ink, and whatever books he cared to buy, and Calvin lent him
several volumes of the early Fathers. The trial was carefully conducted,
lasting over two months. The indictment was drawn up by Calvin in
thirty-eight articles, supported by quotations from the writings of
Servetus. One charge was that he had accepted Strab o’s description of
Judea as a barren country, whereas</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) JOHN CALVIN 483</p>
<p>appeared in person as the accuser. Servetus defended his views
boldly, even to pantheism. By an unusual co-operation of hostile faiths,
the Protestant Council of Geneva asked the Catholic judges at Vienne for
particulars of the charges that had been brought against Servetus there.
One new count was sexual immorality; Servetus replied that rupture had
long since made him impotent, and had kept him from marriage. 65 He was
further accused of having attended Mass at Vienne; he pleaded fear of
death as exculpation. He challenged the jurisdiction of a civil court
over cases of heresy; he assured the court that he had engaged in no
sedition, and had not violated the laws of Geneva; and he asked for an
attorney, better acquainted than himself with these laws, to help him in
his defense. These pleas were refused. The French Inquisition sent an
agent to Geneva to demand that Servetus be sent back to France for the
execution of the sentence that had been pronounced against him;
Servetus, in tears, begged the Council to reject this demand; it did;
but the demand may have stimulated the Council to equal the Inquisition
in severity.</p>
<p>On September i two enemies of Calvin — Ami Perrin and Philibert Ber-
thelier — were allowed to join the judges in the trial. They engaged
Calvin in disputes, to no result; but they persuaded the Council to
consult the other churches of Protestant Switzerland on how Servetus
should be treated. On September 2 Calvin’s leadership in the city was
again challenged in the Council by Patriotes and Libertins; he survived
the storm, but the evident desire of the opposition to rescue Servetus
may have hardened Calvin to pursue the heretic to the death. However, we
should note that the chief prosecutor in the trial was Claude Rigot, a
Libertin . es</p>
<p>On September 3 Servetus presented to the Council a written reply to
the thirty-eight charges adduced by Calvin. He met each point with keen
argu- ment and Scriptural or patristic citations; he questioned Calvin’s
right to interfere in the trial, and called him a disciple of Simon
Magus, a criminal, and a homicide. 67 Calvin answered in twenty-three
pages; these were sub- mitted to Servetus, who returned them to the
Council with such marginal comments as “liar,” “impostor,” “hypocrite,”
“miserable wretch”; 68 prob - ably the strain of a month’s impr isonment
and mental torment had broken Servetus’s self - control. Calvin’s
reports of the trial are themselves in the man - ner of the time; he
writes of Servetus that “the dirty dog wiped his snout”; “the perfidious
scamp” soils each page with “impious ravings.” 69 Servetus petitioned
the Council to indict Calvin as a “repressor of the truth of Jesus
Christ,” to “exterminate” him, confiscate his goods, and, with the
proceeds, reimburse Servetus for the losses he had sustained by Calvin’s
actions. The suggestion was not favorably received.</p>
<p>On October 1 8 the replies came in from the Swiss churches whose
counsel had been asked; all advised the condemnation of Servetus, none
his execution.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>^CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>484</p>
<p>On October 25 Perrin made a last effort to save him by moving for a
retrial before the Council of Two Hundred; he was overruled. On the
twenty-sixth the Small Council, with no member dissenting, passed
sentence of death on two counts of heresy — Unitarianism and the
rejection of infant baptism. When Servetus heard the sentence, says
Calvin, “he moaned like a madman, and . . . beat his breast, and
bellowed in Spanish, Misericordia! MisericordiaP ’ He asked to talk with
Calvin; he pleaded with him for mercy; Calvin offered no more than to
give him the final consolations of the true religion if he would retract
his heresies. Servetus would not. He asked to be beheaded rather than
burned; Calvin was inclined to support this plea, but the aged Farel, in
at the death, reproved him for such tolerance; and the Council voted
that Servetus should be burned alive. 70</p>
<p>The sentence was carried out the next morning, October 27, 1553, on
the hill of Champel, just south of Geneva. On the way Farel importuned
Servetus to earn divine mercy by confessing the crime of heresy;
according to Farel the condemned man replied, “I am not guilty, I have
not merited death”; and he besought God to pardon his accusers. 71 He
was fastened to a stake by iron chains, and his last book was bound to
his side. When the flames reached his face he shrieked with agony. After
half an hour of burning he died.*</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>AN APPEAL FOR TOLERATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Catholics and Protestants united in approving the sentence. The
Inquisi- tion at Vienne, cheated of its living prey, burned Servetus in
effigy. Melanch- thon, in a letter to Calvin and Bullinger, gave “thanks
to the Son of God” for the “punishment of this blasphemous man,” and
called the burning “a pious and mem orable example to all posterity.” 73
Bucer declared from his pulpit in Strasbourg that Servetus had deserved
to be disemboweled and tom. to pieces. 74 Bullinger, generally humane,
agreed that civil magistrates must punish blasphemy with death. 75</p>
<p>Yet even in Calvin’s day some voices spoke for Servetus. A Sicilian
wrote</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>contra prodigiosos errores Michaelis Serveti. If, he argued, we
believe in the inspiration of the Bible, then we know the truth, and all
who oppose it are enemies and blasphemers of God. Since their offense is
immeasurably greater than any other crime, the civil authority must
punish heretics as worse than murderers; for murder merely kills the
body, while heresy accepted damns the soul to everlasting hell. (This
was precisely the Catholic position.) More- over, God Himself has
explicitly instructed us to kill heretics, to smite with the sword any
city that abandons the worship of the true faith revealed by Him. Calvin
quoted the ferocious decrees of Deut. 13:5-15, 17:2-5; Exodus 22:20; and
Lev. 24:16, and argued from them with truly burning eloquence:</p>
<p>Whoever shall maintain that wrong is done to heretics and</p>
<p>blasphemers in punishing them makes himself an accomplice in their
crime. . . . There is no question here of man’s authority; it is God Who
speaks, and it is clear what law He would have kept in the Church</p>
<p>even to the end of the world. Wherefore does He demand of us so</p>
<p>extreme severity if not to show us that due honor is not paid Him so
long as we set not His service above every human consideration,</p>
<p>so that we spare not kin nor blood of any, and forget all
humanity</p>
<p>when the matter is to combat for His glory? 76</p>
<p>Calvin moderated his conclusions by counseling mercy to those whose
heresies were not fundamental, or were clearly due to ignorance or
feeble- ness of mind. But whereas in general he accepted St. Paul as his
guide, he refused to use the Pauline expedient of declaring the old law
superseded by the new. In truth the theocracy that he had apparently
established would have crumbled into disorder if differences of creed
had been allowed public voice.</p>
<p>What, meanwhile, had become of the Erasmian spirit of tolerance?
Eras- mus had been tolerant because he had not been certain; Luther and
Melanch- thon had abandoned tolerance as they progressed in certainty;
Calvin, with lethal precocity, had been certain almost from his
twentieth year. A few humanists who had studied classic thought, and had
not been frightened back into the Roman fold by distaste for the
violence of theological strife, remained to suggest, diffidently, that
certainty in religion and philosophy is unattainable, and that therefore
theologians and philosophers should not kill.</p>
<p>The humanist who most clearly spoke for tolerance amid the clash of
cer- tainties had been for a time one of Calvin’s closest friends.
Sebastian Castellio, bom in the French Jura in 1515, became an adept in
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, taught Greek at Lyons, lived with Calvin in
Strasbourg, was ap- pointed by him rector of the Latin School at Geneva
(1541), and began there a translation of the entire Bible into
Ciceronian Latin. While he admired Calvin as a man, he abominated the
doctrine of predestination, and fretted</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>under the new discipline of body and mind. In 1 544 he charged the
Genevese ministers with intolerance, impurity, and drunkenness. Calvin
complained to the Council; Castellio was found guilty of calumny, and
was banished ( 1 544) • F° r nine years he lived in great poverty,
supporting a large family, and working at night on his version of the
Scriptures. He finished this in 1551; then, lonesome for the placid
drudgery of scholarship, he began again at Genesis 1 : 1, and translated
the Bible into French. Finally (1553) he ob- tained a professorship of
Greek at the University of Basel. He sympathized with the Unitarians,
longed to help Servetus, and was shocked by Calvin’s defense of the
execution. Under assumed names he and Caelius Curio pub- lished (March
1554) the first modern classic on toleration: De haereticis an sint
perse quendi (Should Heretics Be Persecuted?)</p>
<p>The main body of the work was an anthology, compiled by Curio, of
Christian pleas for tolerance, from Lactantius and Jerome to Erasmus,
the early Luther, and Calvin himself. Castellio contributed the argument
in preface and epilogue. For hundreds of years, he pointed out, men had
debated free will, predestination, heaven and hell, Christ and the
Trinity, and other difficult matters; no agreement had been reached;
probably none would ever be reached. But none is necessary, said
Castellio; such disputes do not make men better; all that we need is to
carry the spirit of Christ into our daily lives, to feed the poor, help
the sick, and love even our enemies. It seemed to him ridiculous that
all the new sects, as well as the old Church, should pretend to absolute
truth and make their creeds obligatory on those over whom they had
physical power; as a result a man would be orthodox in one city and
become a heretic by entering another; he would have to change his
religion, like his money, at each frontier. Can we imagine Christ
ordering a man to be burned alive for advocating adult baptism? The
Mosaic laws calling for the death of a heretic were superseded by the
law of Christ, which is one of mercy, not of despotism and terror. If a
man denies life after death, and rejects all law, he may (said
Castellio) be justly silenced by the magis- trates, but he should not be
killed. Moreover (he thought), persecution of beliefs is futile;
martyrdom for an idea spreads the idea far more rapidly than the martyr
could have done had he been allowed to live. What a tragedy (he
concluded) that those who had so lately freed themselves from the
terrible Inquisition should so soon imitate its tyranny, should so soon
force men back into Cimmerian darkness after so promising a dawn! 77</p>
<p>Knowing Castellio’s sentiments, Calvin at once recognized his hand in
the De haereticis. He delegated the task of answering it to his most
brilliant dis - ciple, Theodore de Besze, or Beze, or Beza. Born in
Vezelay of aristocratic lineage, Theodore studied law at Orleans and
Bourges, practiced it success- fully in Paris, wrote Latin poetry,
charmed some women by his wit, more by his prosperity, lived a gay life,
married, fell dangerously ill, experienced</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) JOHN CALVIN 487</p>
<p>a sickbed conversion reverse to Loyola’s, adopted Protestantism, fled
to Geneva, presented himself to Calvin, and was made professor of Greek
at the University of Lausanne. It is remarkable that a Protestant
refugee from a Huguenot-persecuting France should have undertaken to
defend persecu- tion. He did it with the skill of a lawyer and the
devotion of a friend. In September 1554, he issued his De haereticis a
civili ma.gistra.tu puniendis libellus ( A Little Book on the Duty of
Civil Magistrates to Punish Heretics ). He pointed out again that
religious toleration was impossible to one who accepted the divine
inspiration of the Scriptures. But if we reject the Bible as God’s Word,
on what shall we build the religious faith that is so clearly
indispensable — considering the natural wickedness of men — to moral
restraint, social order, and civilization? Nothing would then be left
but chaotic doubts disintegrating Christianity. To a sincere believer in
the Bible there could be only one religion; all others must be false or
incomplete. Yes, the New Testament preaches a law of love, but this does
not excuse us from punishing thieves and murderers; how then does it
warrant us in sparing heretics?</p>
<p>Castellio returned to the contest in a tract Contra libellum Calvini,
but it lay unpublished for half a century. In another manuscript, De
arte dubitandi , he anticipated Descartes by making the “art of
doubting” the first step in the pursuit of truth. In Four Dialogues
(1578) he defended free will and the possibility of universal salvation.
In 1 562, in Conseil 4 la France desolee, he appealed in vain to
Catholics and Protestants to end the civil wars that were devastating
France, and to allow every believer in Christ “to serve God ac - cording
not to other men’s faith but to his own.” 78 Hardly anyone heard a voice
so out of tune with the time. Castellio died in poverty at the age of
forty-eight (1563). Calvin pronounced his early death a just judgment of
a just God.</p>
<p>vra. CALVIN TO THE END: 1 554-64</p>
<p>Perhaps Calvin knew Castellio’s secret leaning toward Unitarianism—
be- lief in a God not triune, therefore a rejection of Christ’s
divinity; and he can be forgiven for seeing in this basic doubt the
beginning of the end for Chris- tianity. He feared this heresy all the
more because he found it in Geneva itself, above all among the
Protestant fugitives from Italy. These men saw no sense in replacing
incredible transubstantiation with incredible predesti- nation; their
rebellion attacked the fundamental assumption of Christianity, that
Christ was the Son of God. Matteo Gribaldi, professor of jurisprudence
at Padua, had a summer home near Geneva. During the trial of Servetus he
spoke openly against civil punishment for religious opinions, and
advocated freedom of worship for all. Hailed before the Council, he was
banished on suspicion of Unitarianism (1559). He secured appointment as
professor of</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>law in the University of Tubingen; Calvin sent word there of
Gribaldi’s doubts; the university pressed him to sign a Trinitarian
confession; instead he fled to Bern, where he died of the plague in
1564. Giorgio Blandrata, an Italian physician domiciled in Geneva, was
summoned before the Council on a charge of questioning the divinity of
Christ; he fled to Poland, where he found some tolerance for his heresy.
Valentino Gentile, from Calabria, openly expressed Unitarian views in
Geneva, was thrown into prison, was sentenced to death (1557), recanted,
was released, went to Lyons, was arrested by the Catholic authorities,
but was freed on his assurance that his chief interest lay in refuting
Calvin. He joined Blandrata in Poland, returned to Switzerland, was
seized by the Bernese magistrates, was convicted of per- jury and
heresy, and was beheaded (1566).</p>
<p>Amid these battles for the Lord, Calvin continued to live simply, and
to rule Geneva by the power of a personality armed with the delusions of
his followers. His position became stronger as years gave it roots. His
only weakness was physical; headaches, asthma, dyspepsia, stone, gout,
and fever racked and thinned his frame, and formed his face to taut
severity and gloom. A long illness in 1558 — 59 left him lame and
feeble, with repeated hemorrhages of the lungs. Thereafter he had to
keep to his bed most of the time, though he continued to study, direct,
and preach, even when he had to be borne to the sanctuary in a chair. On
April 25, 1564, he made his will, full of con- fidence in his election
to everlasting glory. On the twenty-sixth the</p>
<p>syndics and the Council came to his bedside; he asked their pardon
for his outbreaks of anger, and begged them to hold steadfastly to the
pure doctrine of the Reformed Church. Farel, now in his eightieth year,
came from Neu- chatel to bid him au revoir. After many days of prayer
and suffering Calvin found peace (May 27, 1564).</p>
<p>His influence was even greater than Luther’s, but he walked in a path
that</p>
<p>A year before his death his pupil Olevianus joined with Melanchthon’s
pupil Ursinus in preparing the Heidelberg Catechism, which became the
accepted expression of the Reformed faith in Germany and Holland.
Beze</p>
<p>JOHN CALVIN</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>and Bullinger reconciled the creeds of Calvin and Zwingli in the
Second Helvetic Confession (1566), which became authoritative for the
Reformed churches in Switzerland and France. In Geneva itself Calvin’s
work was ably continued by Beze. But year by year the business leaders
who controlled the Councils resisted more and more successfully the
attempts of the Consistory and the Venerable Company to place moral
checks upon economic opera- tions. After Beze’s death (1608) the
merchant princes consolidated their supremacy, and the Genevan Church
lost the directive privileges that Calvin had won for it in nonreligious
affairs. In the eighteenth century the influence of Voltaire moderated
the Calvinist tradition, and ended the sway of a puritan ethic among the
people. Catholicism patiently struggled to recap- ture a place in the
city; it offered a Christianity without gloom and an ethic without
severity; in 1954 the population was 42 per cent Catholic, 47 per cent
Protestant. 79 But the most impressive man-made structure in Geneva is
the noble “Reformation Monument” which, running majestically along a
park wall, celebrates the victories of Protestantism, and raises at its
center the powerful figures of Farel, Calvin, Beze, and Knox.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the hard theocracy of Calvin was sprouting democratic buds.
The efforts of the Calvinist leaders to give schooling to all, and their
inculca- tion of disciplined character, helped the sturdy burghers of
Holland to oust the alien dictatorship of Spain, and supported the
revolt of nobles and clergy in Scotland against a fascinating but
imperious queen. The stoicism of a hard creed made the strong souls of
the Scottish Covenanters, the English and Dutch Puritans, the Pilgrims
of New England. It steadied the heart of Crom- well, guided the pen of
blind Milton, and broke the power of the backward- facing Stuarts. It
encouraged brave and ruthless men to win a continent and spread the base
of education and self-government until all men could be free. Men who
chose their own pastors soon claimed to choose their governors, and the
self-ruled congregation became the self-governed municipality. The myth
of divine election justified itself in the making of America.</p>
<p>When this function had been performed, the theory of predestination
fell into the backwaters of Protestant belief. As social order returned
in Europe after the Thirty Years’ War, in England after the revolutions
of 1642 and 1689, in America after 1793, the pride of divine election
changed into the pride of work and accomplishment; men felt stronger and
more secure; fear lessened, and the frightened cruelty that had
generated Calvin’s God gave way to a more humane vision that compelled a
reconception of deity. Decade by decade the churches that had taken
their lead from Calvin discarded the harsher elements of his creed.
Theologians dared to believe that all who died in infancy were saved,
and one respected divine announced, without causing a commotion, that
“the number of the finally lost . . . will be</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>490</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>very inconsiderable.” 80 We are grateful to be so reassured, and we
will agree that even error lives because it serves some vital need. But
we shall always find it hard to love the man who darkened the human soul
with the most absurd and blasphemous conception of God in all the long
and honored his- tory of nonsense.</p>
