<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>The Byzantine World</p>
<p>565-1095</p>
<p>I. HERACLIUS</p>
<p>I F now we turn from the Oriental side of the endless duel between
East and West, we are soon moved with sympathy for a great empire
harassed at once with internal discord and, on every side, external
attack. Avars and Slavs were crossing the Danube and taking possession
of imperial lands and towns; Persians were preparing to overrun Western
Asia; Spain was lost to the Visigoths; and the Lombards, three years
after Justinian’s death, con - quered half of Italy (568) . Plague swept
the Empire in 542 and again in 566; famine in 569; poverty, barbarism,
and war broke down communications, discouraged commerce, stifled
literature and art.</p>
<p>Justinian’s successors were men of ability, but only a century of
Napoleons could have coped with their problems. Justin II (565-78)
fought vigorously against an expanding Persia. Tiberius II (578-82),
favored by the gods with almost every virtue, was taken by them after a
brief and just reign. Maurice (582-602) attacked the invading Avars with
courage and skill, but received little support from the nation;
thousands entered monasteries to escape mili- tary service; and when
Maurice forbade the monasteries to receive new members until the danger
was over, the monks clamored for his fall. 1 The centurion Phocas led a
revolution of the army and the populace against the aristocracy and the
government (602) ; the five sons of Maurice were butch- ered before his
eyes; the old Emperor refused to let the nurse of his youngest child
save it by substituting for it her own; he himself was beheaded; the six
heads were hung up as a spectacle for the people, and the bodies were
cast into the sea. The Empress Constantina and her three daughters, and
many of the aristocracy, were slain, usually with torture, with or
without trial; eyes were pierced, tongues were torn out, limbs were
amputated; 2 once more the scenes of the French Revolution were
rehearsed.</p>
<p>Khosru II took advantage of the disorder, and renewed the old war of
Persia against Greece. Phocas made peace with the Arabs, and transported
the entire Byzantine army into Asia; he was everywhere defeated by the
Persians, while the Avars, unresisted, seized nearly all the
agricultural hinter- land of Constantinople. The aristocracy of the
capital appealed to Heraclius, the Greek governor of Africa, to come to
the rescue of the Empire and their</p>
<p>4 2 3</p>
<p>424 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>property. He excused himself on the ground of age, but sent them his
son. The younger Heraclius fitted out a fleet, sailed into the Bosporus,
overthrew Phocas, exhibited the mutilated corpse of the usurper to the
populace, and was hailed as emperor (610).</p>
<p>Heraclius deserved his title and his name. With almost the energy of
Heracles he set himself to reorganize the shattered state. He spent ten
years in rebuilding the morale of the people, the strength of the army,
and the re- sources of the treasury. He gave land to peasants on
condition that the eldest son in each family should render military
service. Meanwhile the Persians captured Jerusalem (614), and advanced
to Chalcedon (615); only the By- zantine navy, still controlling the
waters, saved the capital and Europe. Soon afterward the Avar hordes
marched up to the Golden Horn, raided the sub- urbs, and took thousands
of Greeks into slavery. The loss of the hinterland and of Egyp t cut off
the city’s supply of grain, and compelled abolition of the dole (618).
Heraclius, desperate, thought of transporting his army to Carthage and
thence attempting to retake Egypt; the people and the clergy refused to
let him go, and the Patriarch Sergius agreed to lend him the wealth of
the Greek Church, at interest, to finance a holy war for the recapture
of Jerusalem. 3 Heraclius made peace with the Avars, and at last (622)
set out against the Persians.</p>
<p>The campaigns that followed were masterpieces of conception and
execu- tion. For six years Heraclius carried the war to the enemy, and
repeatedly defeated Khosru. In his absence a Persian army and a host of
Avars, Bulgars, and Slavs laid siege to Constantinople (626) ; an army
despatched by Hera- clius defeated the Persians at Chalcedon, and the
garrison and populace of the capital, roused by the Patriarch, scattered
the barbarian horde. Heraclius marched to the gates of Ctesiphon; Khosru
II fell; Persia pled for peace, and surrendered all that Khosru had
taken from the Greek Empire. After seven years’ absence, Heraclius
returned in triumph to Constantinople.</p>
<p>He hardly deserved the fate that shamed his old age. Weakened by
disease, he was devoting his last energies to strengthening the civil
administration when suddenly wild Arab tribes poured into Syria (634),
defeated an ex- hausted Greek army, and captured Jerusalem (638) ; and
even as the Emperor lay on his deathbed Egypt fell (641 ) . Persia and
Byzantium had fought each other to a common ruin. Under Constans II
(642-68) the Arab victories continued; thinking the Empire beyond
saving, Constans spent his last years in the West, and was killed in
Syracuse. His son Constantine IV Pogonatus was abler or luckier. When
through five crucial years (673-8) the Moslems made another effort to
take Constantinople, “Greek fire,” now mentioned for the first time,
saved Europe. The new weapon, allegedly invented by Cal- linicus of
Syria, was akin to our flame throwers, an incendiary mixture of naphtha,
quicklime, sulphur, and pitch; it was thrown against enemy ships or
troops on flaming arrows, or blown against them through tubes, or shot
on</p>
<p>THE BYZANTINE WORLD</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>iron balls bearing flax and tow soaked in oil; or it was loaded and
fired on small boats which were set adrift against the foe. The
composition of the mixture was a secret successfully guarded for two
centuries by the Byzantine government; to reveal any knowledge of it was
treason and sacrilege. The Saracens finally discovered the formula, and
used “Saracen fire” against the Crusaders. Until the invention of
gunpowder it was the most talked-of weapon in the medieval world.</p>
<p>The Moslems made another assault upon the Greek capital in 7 17. An
army of 80,000 Arabs and Persians under Moslema crossed the Hellespont
at Aby- dos, and besieged Constantinople from the rear. At the same time
the Arabs fitted out a fleet of 1800 vessels, presumably small; this
armada entered the Bosporus, overshadowing the straits, said a
chronicler, like a moving forest. It was the good fortune of the Greeks
that in this crisis an able general, Leo “the Isaurian,” replaced the
incompetent Theodosius III on the throne, and assumed the organization
of defense. He disposed the small Byzantine navy with tactical skill,
and saw to it that every ship was well supplied with Greek fire. In a
little while the Arab vessels were aflame, and nearly every ship in the
great fleet was destroyed. The Greek army made a sortie upon the be-
siegers, and won so decisive a victory that Moslema withdrew to
Syria.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ICONOCLASTS: 717-802</li>
</ol>
<p>Leo III derived his cognomen from the district of Isauria in Cilicia;
accord- ing to Theophanes he was born there of Armenian parentage. His
father moved thence to Thrace, raised sheep, and sent 500 of them, with
his son Leo in the bargain, as a present to the Emperor Justinian II.
Leo became a guards- man of the palace, then commander of the Anatolian
legions, finally, by the convincing suffrage of the army, emperor. He
was a man of ambition, strong will, and patient perseverance; a general
who repeatedly defeated Moslem forces greatly superior to his own; a
statesman who gave the Empire the stability of just laws justly
enforced, reformed taxation, reduced serfdom, extended peasant
proprietorship, distributed lands, repopulated deserted regions, and
constructively revised the laws. His only fault was autocracy.</p>
<p>Perhaps in his Asiatic youth he had imbibed from Moslems, Jews, Mani-
cheans, Monophysites, and Paulicians a Stoic-Puritan conception of
religion that condemned the addiction of popular Christianity to image
worship, ceremonialism, and superstition. The Old Testament (Deut. iv,
15) had ex- plicitly forbidden any “graven i mage of any figure, male or
female, the like- ness of any beast that is on the earth.” The early
Church had frowned upon images as relics of paganism, and had looked
with horror upon pagan sculp- tures purporting to represent the gods.
But the triumph of Christianity under Constantine, and the influence of
Greek surroundings, traditions, and statu-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>ary in Constantinople and the Hellenistic East, had softened this
opposition. As the number of worshiped saints multiplied, a need arose
for identifying and remembering them; pictures of them and of Mary were
produced in great number; and in the case of Christ not only His
imagined form but His cross became objects of reverence — even, for
simple minds, magic talismans. A natural freedom of fancy among the
people turned the holy relics, pictures, and statues into objects of
adoration; people prostrated themselves before them, kissed them, burned
candles and incense before them, crowned them with flowers, and sought
miracles from their occult influence. In Greek Christianity especially,
sacred images were everywhere — in churches, monas- teries, houses and
shops, even on furniture, trinkets, and clothes. Cities in danger from
epidemic, famine, or war tended to rely upon the power of the relics
they harbored, or on their patron saint, rather than on human enter-
prise. Fathers and councils of the Church repeatedly explained that the
images were not deities, but only reminders thereof; 4 the people did
not care to make such distinctions.</p>
<p>Leo III was offended by these excesses of popular faith; it seemed to
him that paganism was in this manner reconquering Christianity; and he
felt keenly the satire directed by Moslems, Jews, and Christian sects
against the superstitions of the orthodox multitude. To weaken the power
of the monks over the people and the government, and win the support of
Nestorians and Monophysites, he assembled a great council of bishops and
senators, and with their consent he promulgated in 726 an edict
requiring the complete removal of icons from the churches;
representations of Christ and the Virgin were forbidden; and church
murals were to be covered with plaster. Some of the higher clergy
supported the edict; the lower clergy and the monks protested, the
people revolted. Soldiers trying to enforce the law were attacked by
wor- shipers horrified and infuriated by this desecration of the dearest
symbols of their faith. In Greece and the Cyclades rebel forces
proclaimed a rival em- peror, and sent a fleet to capture the capital.
Leo destroyed the fleet, and imprisoned the leaders of the opposition.
In Italy, where pagan forms of worship had never died, the people were
almost unanimous against the edict; Venice, Ravenna, and Rome drove out
the Imperial officers; and a council of Western bishops summoned by Pope
Gregory II anathematized the Icono- clasts — image breakers — without
naming the Emperor. The patriarch of Con- stantinople joined the revolt,
and sought by it to restore the independence of the Eastern Church from
the state. Leo deposed him (730), but did him no violence; and the edict
was so mildly enforced that when Leo died (741), most of the churches
retained their frescoes and mosaics unharmed.</p>
<p>His son Constantine V (741-75) continued his policy, and received
from hostile historians the genial epithet of Copronymus — “named from
dung.” A council of Eastern bishops, called by him at Constantinople
(754), con- demned image worship as “abominable,” charged that through
such worship</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE BYZANTINE WORLD 427</p>
<p>“Satan had re - introduced idolatry,” denounced “the ignorant artist
who with his unclean hands gives form to that which should be believed
only by the heart,” 5 and decreed that all images in the churches should
be erased or destroyed. Constantine executed the decree without
moderation or tact; imprisoned and tortured resisting monks; again eyes
or tongues were tom out, noses were cut off; the patriarch was tortured
and beheaded (767) . Like Henry VIII, Constantine V closed monasteries
and convents, confiscated their property, turned the buildings to
secular uses, and bestowed monastic lands upon his favorites. At Ephesus
the imperial governor, with the approval of the Emperor, assembled the
monks and nuns of the province, and forced them to marry one another as
an alternative to death. 6 The persecution con- tinued for five years
(765-7 1 ) .</p>
<p>Constantine exacted from his son Leo IV (775-80) an oath to continue
the Iconoclastic policy; Leo did what he could despite his weak
constitution. Dying, he named his ten-year-old son Constantine VI as
emperor (780-97), and nominated his widow, the Empress Irene, as regent
during the youth’s minority. She ruled with ability and without scruple.
Sympathizing with the religious feelings of the people and her sex, she
quietly ended the enforce- ment of the Iconoclast edicts; permitted the
monks to return to their monas- teries and their pulpits, and convened
the prelates of Christendom in the Second Council of Nicaea (787), where
350 bishops, under the lead of papal legates, restored the veneration —
not the worship — of sacred images as a legiti- mate expression of
Christian piety and faith.</p>
<p>In 790 Constantine VI came of age. Finding his mother reluctant
to</p>
<p>surrender her power, he deposed and exiled her. Soon the amiable
youth relented; he brought her back to court, and associated her with
him in the im- perial power (792). In 797 she had him imprisoned and
blinded, and there- after reigned under the title of emperor — not
basilissa but basileus. For five years she administered the Empire with
wisdom and finesse: lowered taxes, scattered largess among the poor,
founded charitable institutions, and beau- tified the capital. The
people applauded and loved her, but the army fretted at being ruled by a
woman more capable than most men. In 802 the Icono- clasts revolted,
deposed her, and made her treasurer Nicephorus emperor. She yielded
quietly, and asked of him only a decent and safe retreat; he promised
it, but banished her to Lesbos, and left her to earn a scanty living as
a seamstress. Nine months later she died, with hardly a penny or a
friend. The theologians forgave her crimes because of her piety, and the
Church canonized her as a saint.</p>

<li>IMPERIAL KALEIDOSCOPE: 802-1057</li>
</ol>
<p>A full perspective of Byzantine civilization would require at this
point a record of many emperors and some empresses — not of their
intrigues, palace</p>
<p>428 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>revolutions, and assassinations, but of their policy and legislation,
and their age-long effort to protect the diminishing Empire from Moslems
on the south and Slavs and Bulgars on the north. In some respects it is
an heroic picture: through all the fluent shifts of appearing and
disappearing figures the Greek heritage was in good measure preserved;
economic order and continuity were maintained; civilization continued,
as if by some enduring impetus from the ancient labors of Pericles and
Augustus, Diocletian and Constantine. In other aspects it is a sorry
spectacle of generals climbing over slain rivals to imperial power, to
be slain in their turn; of pomp and luxury, eye-gouging and nose-
cutting, incense and piety and treachery; of emperor and patriarch
unscrupu- lously struggling to determine whether the empire should be
ruled by might or myth, by sword or word. So we pass by Nicephorus I
(802-11) and his wars with Harun al-Rashid; Michael I (811-13),
dethroned and tonsured into monkhood because of his defeat by the
Bulgars; Leo V the Armenian (813-20), who again forbade the worship of
images, and was assassinated while singing an anthem in church; Michael
II (820- 9) the illiterate “Stam - merer,” who fell in love with a nun,
and persuaded the Senate to entreat him to marry her; 7 Theophilus
(829-42), a legislative reformer, royal builder, and conscientious
administrator, who revived the Iconoclastic persecution, and died of
dysentery; his widow Theodora, who as an able regent (842-56) ended the
pers ecution; Michael III “the Drunkard” (842 -67), whose amiable
incompetence left the government first to his mother and, after her
death, to his cultured and capable uncle Caesar Bardas. Then suddenly a
unique and unexpected figure appeared on the scene, overthrew every
precedent except violence, and founded the powerful Macedonian
dynasty.</p>
<p>Basil the Macedonian was born (812?) near Hadrianople of an Armenian
peasant family. As a child he was captured by Bulgars, and lived his
youth among them beyond the Danube, in what was then called Macedonia.
Escap- ing in his twenty-fifth year, he made his way to Constantinople,
and was hired as groom by a diplomat who admired his physical strength
and massive head. He accompanied his master on a mission to Greece, and
there attracted the attention, and some of the wealth, of the widow
Danielis. Back in the capital, he tamed a spirited horse for Michael
III, was taken into the Em- peror’s service, and, though quite
illiterate, rose to the position of lord cham - berlain. Basil was ever
convenient and competent; when Michael sought a husband for his
mistress, Basil divorced his peasant wife, sent her to Thrace with a
comforting dowry, and married Eudocia, who continued her services to the
Emperor. 8 Michael supplied Basil with a mistress, but the Macedonian
thought he deserved the throne as reward. He persuaded Michael that
Bardas was plotting to depose him, and then killed Bardas with his own
enormous hands (866). Long accustomed to reign without ruling, Michael
made Basil coemperor and left him all the tasks of government. When
Michael threat- ened to dismiss him, Basil arranged and supervised his
assassination, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE BYZANTINE WORLD 429</p>
<p>became sole emperor (867) : so, even under hereditary monarchy,
career was open to talent. With such servility and crime the letterless
son of a peasant established the longest of all Byzantine dynasties, and
began a nineteen-year reign of excellent administration, legislating
wisely, judging justly, replenish- ing the treasury, and building new
churches and palaces for the city that he had captured. No one dared
oppose him; and when he died by a hunting acci- dent the throne passed
with unwonted quiet to his son.</p>
<p>Leo VI (886-912) was the complement of his father: learned, bookish,
sedentary, mild; gossip concluded that he was Michael’s, not Basil’s,
son, and perhaps Eudocia was not sure. He earned his cognomen of “the
Wise” not by his poetry, nor by his treatises on theology,
administration, and war, but by his reorganization of provincial and
ecclesiastical government, his new formulations of Byzantine law, and
his meticulous regulation of industry. Though an admiring pupil of the
scholarly patriarch Photius, and himself devoted to piety, he shocked
the clergy, and amused the people, by four marriages. His first two
wives died without bearing him a son; Leo insisted on a son as the only
alternative to a war of succession; the moral theology of the Church
forbade a third marriage; Leo persisted, and his fourth wife, Zoe,
crowned his resolution with a boy.</p>
<p>Constantine VII (912-58) was called Porphyrogenitus — “born in the
pur - ple”— i.e., in the porphyry-lined apartment reserved for the use
of expecting empresses. He inherited his fath er’s literary tastes, not
his administrative capacity. He composed for his son two books on the
art of government: one on the “themes” or provinces of the Empire, and a
Book of Ceremonies de - scribing the ritual and etiquette required of
the emperor. He supervised the compilation of works on agriculture,
medicine, veterinary medicine, and zoology, and formed an “historians’
history of the world” by selecting ex - tracts from historians and
chroniclers. Under his patronage Byzantine litera- ture flourished in
its polished and anemic way.</p>
<p>Perhaps Romanus II (958-63) was like other children, and did not read
his father’s books. He married a Greek girl, Theophano; she was
suspected of poisoning her father-in- law and hastening Romanus’ death;
and before her twenty-four-year-old husband was dead she seduced into
her arms the ascetic general Nicephorus II Phocas, who with her
connivance seized the throne. Nicephorus had already driven the Moslems
from Aleppo and Crete (961); in 965 he drove them from Cyprus, in 968
from Antioch; it was these victories that shattered the Abbasid
caliphate. Nicephorus pled with the patriarch to promise all the rewards
and honors of martyrdom to soldiers who should fall in battle against
the Moslems; the patriarch refused on the ground that all soldiers were
temporarily polluted by the blood that they shed; had he con- sented,
the Crusades might have begun a century earlier. Nicephorus lost
ambition, and retired into the palace to live like an anchorite. Bored
with this monastic existence, Theophano became the mistress of the
general John</p>
<p>43° the age of faith (chap. xviii</p>
<p>Tzimisces. With her connivance he killed Nicephorus (969) and seized
the throne; remorseful, he repudiated and exiled her, and went off to
atone for his crimes by transient victories against the Moslems and the
Slavs.</p>
<p>His successor was one of the most powerful personalities in Byzantine
his- tory. Basil II, born to Romanus and Theophano (958), had served as
co- emperor with Nicephorus Phocas and Tzimisces; now (976) he began at
the age of eighteen an undivided rule that lasted half a century.
Troubles encom- passed him: his chief minister plotted to displace him;
the feudal barons, whom he proposed to tax, financed conspiracies
against him; Bardas Sclerus, general of the eastern army, rebelled, and
was suppressed by Bardas Phocas, who then had himself proclaimed emperor
by his troops; the Moslems were recovering nearly all that Tzimisces had
won from them in Syria; the Bulgars were at their zenith, encroaching
upon the Empire in east and west. Basil suppressed the revolt, reclaimed
Armenia from the Saracens, and in a ruthless thirty years’ war destroyed
the Bulgarian power. After his victory in 1014 he blinded 15,000
prisoners, leaving one eye in every hundredth man to lead the tragic
host back to Samuel, the Bulgarian tsar; perhaps in terror rather than
in admiration the Greeks called him Bulgaroctonus, Killer of Bulgars.
Amid these campaigns he found time to war against “those w ho enriched
themselves at the expense of the poor.” By his laws of 996 he sought to
break up some of the large estates, and to encourage the spread of a
free peasantry. He was about to lead an armada against the Saracens in
Sicily when death surprised him in his sixty-eighth year. Not since
Heraclius had the Empire been so extensive, nor since Justinian so
strong.</p>
<p>The Byzantine decline was resumed under his aged brother Constantine
VIII (1025-8). Having no offspring but three daughters, Constantine per-
suaded Romanus Argyrus to marry the eldest, Zoe, who was nearing fifty.
As regent, and with the help of her sister Theodora, Zoe governed the
state through the reigns of Romanus III (1028-34), Michael IV
(1034-42),</p>
<p>Michael V ( 1 042 ) , and Constantine IX (1042-55); and seldom had
the Em- pire been better ruled. The imperial sisters attacked corruption
in state and Church, and forced officials to disgorge their embezzled
hoards; one who had been chief minister surrendered 5300 pounds of gold
(,226,000) which he had secreted in a cistern; and when the Patriarch
Alexis died, a cache of 100,000 pounds of silver (7,000,000) was
discovered in his rooms. 0 For a brief interlude the sale of offices was
stopped. Zoe and Theodora sat as judges on the highest tribunal, and
dispensed stern justice. Nothing could rival Zoe’s impartiality. Having
at sixty-two married Constantine IX, and knowing that her cosmetic skill
had preserved barely the surface of her charms, she allowed her new
husband to bring his mistress Sclerena to live in the royal palace; he
chose quarters between their apartments, and Zoe never visited him
without making sure that he was disengaged. 10 When Zoe died (1050),
Theodora retired to a convent, and Constantine IX ruled for five years
with wisdom</p>
<p>THE BYZANTINE WORLD</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>and taste; he chose men of competence and culture for his aides,
rebeautified St. Sophia, built hospitals and refuges for the poor, and
supported literature and art. At his death (1055) the supporters of the
Macedonian dynasty led a popular revolt that brought the virgin Theodora
out of her conventual re- treat, and, much against her will, crowned her
empress. Despite her seventy- four years she and her ministers governed
efficiently; but in 1056 she died so suddenly that chaos ensued. The
palace aristocracy named Michael VI em- peror; the army preferred the
general Isaac Comnenus. One battle decided the issue; Michael became a
monk, and Comnenus entered the capital in 1057 as emperor. The
Macedonian dynasty had come to an end after 190 years of violence, war,
adultery, piety, and excellent administration.</p>
<p>Isaac Comnenus resigned after two years, named Constantine Ducas, the
president of the Senate, as his successor, and entered a monastery. When
Constantine died (1067) his widow Eudocia acted as regent for four
years; but the demands of war required a sterner leader, and she married
and crowned Romanus IV. Romanus was defeated by the Turks at Manzikert
(1071), returned to Constantinople in disgrace, was deposed, imprisoned,
and blinded, and was allowed to die of his untended wounds. When Alexius
Comnenus I, nephew of Isaac Comnenus, came to the throne (1081), the
Byzantine Empire seemed near its fall. The Turks had taken Jerusalem
(1076), and were advancing through Asia Minor; the Patzinak and Cuman
tribes were approaching Constantinople from the north; the Normans were
attacking the Byzantine outposts in the Adriatic; the government and the
army were crippled with treason, incompetence, corruption, and
cowardice. Alexius met the situation with subtlety and courage. He sent
agents to foment revolution in Norman Italy; gave Venice commercial
privileges in return for the aid of its navy against the Normans;
confiscated Church treasures to rebuild his army; took the field in
person, and won victories by strategy rather than by blood. Amid these
foreign cares he found time to reorganize the government and its
defenses, and gave the tottering Empire another cen- tury of life. In
1095, in a far-reaching stroke of diplomacy, he appealed to the West to
come to the aid of the Christian East; at the Council of Piacenza he
offered a reunion of the Greek with the Latin Church in return for the
unity of Europe against Islam. His appeal conspired with other factors
to unleash the first of those dramatic Crusades that were to save, and
then destroy, Byzantium.</p>

<li>BYZANTINE LIFE: 566-IO95</li>
</ol>
<p>At the beginning of the eleventh century the Greek Empire, through
the arms and statesmanship of the Isaurian and Macedonian dynasties, had
reached again the power, wealth, and culture of its zenith under
Justinian. Asia Minor, northern Syria, Cyprus, Rhodes, the Cyclades, and
Crete had</p>
<p>43 2 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>been wrested from the Moslems; southern Italy was once more Magna
Grecia, ruled by Constantinople; the Balkans had been recaptured from
Bulgars and Slavs; Byzantine industry and commerce again dominated the
Mediterranean; Greek Christianity had triumphed in the Balkans and
Russia; and Greek art and literature were enjoying a Macedonian
renaissance. The revenue of the state in the eleventh century reached
the present equivalent of ,4oo,ooo,ooo. n</p>
<p>Constantinople was at the crest of its curve, surpassing ancient Rome
and Alexandria, contemporary Baghdad and Cordova, in trade, wealth,
luxury, beauty, refinement, and art. Its population of nearly a million
12 was now pre- dominantly Asiatic or Slav — Armenians, Cappadocians,
Syrians, Jews, Bul- gars, and half-Slav Greeks, with a colorful infusion
of merchants and soldiers from Scandinavia, Russia, Italy, and Islam;
and at the top a thinning layer of Greek aristocrats. A thousand
varieties of homes — gabled, terraced, or domed — with balconies,
loggias, gardens, or pergolas; full markets reeking with the products of
all the world; a thousand narrow muddy streets of tenements and shops;
splendid thoroughfares bordered with stately mansions and shady
porticoes, peopled with statuary, spanned with arches of triumph, and
leading out to the countryside through guarded gates in the fortress
walls; complex royal palaces — the Triconchus of Theophilus, the New
Palace of Basil I, the Bucoleon of Nicephorus Phocas, descending by
marble stairs to a sculptured co lonnaded wharf on the Sea of Marmora;
churches “as many as there are days in the year” (said a traveler) , and
several of them</p>
<p>Within the city palaces of the aristocracy and the great merchants,
and in the villas of seaside and hinterland, every luxury available to
that age could be found, and decoration uninhibited by Semitic tabus:
marbles of every grain and hue, murals and mosaics, sculptures and fine
pottery, curtains slid- ing on silver rods, tapestries and carpets and
silks, doors inlaid with silver or ivory, furniture exquisitely carved,
table services of silver or gold. Here moved the world of Byzantine
society: men and women of fine face and figure, dressed in colored silks
and lace and furs, and rivaling the graces, amours, and intrigues of
Bourbon Paris and Versailles. Never were ladies better powdered and
scented, jeweled and coiffured; in the imperial palaces fires were kept
burning all the year long to brew the perfumes required to deodorize
queens and princesses . 13 Never before had life been so ornate and
ceremonious, so colorful with processions, receptions, spectacles and
games, so minutely ordained by protocol and etiquette. At the Hippodrome
as well</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII ) THE BYZANTINE WORLD 433</p>
<p>as in the court the firmly established aristocracy flaunted its
finest raiment and ornament; on the highways its stately equipages
passed, so reckless as to earn the hatred of the pedestrian poor, and so
rich as to bring down the anathemas of prelates who served God in
vessels, and on altars, of marble, alabaster, silver, and gold.
Gonstantinople, said Robert of Clari , 14 contained “two thirds of the
world’s wealth”; even the common “Greek inhabitants,” reported Benjamin
of Tudela, “seem all to be the children of kings.” 15</p>
<p>“If Constantinople,” said a twelfth - century writer, “surpasses all
other cities in wealth, it also surpa sses them in vice.” 10 All the
sins of a great city found room here, impartially in rich and poor.
Brutality and piety took turns in the same imperial souls; and among the
people intensity of religious need could be adjusted to the corruption
or violence of politics and war. The cas- tration of children to serve
as eunuchs in harems and administration, the assassination or blinding
of present or potential rivals for the throne, contin- ued through
divers dynasties and the monotonous kaleidoscope of changeless change.
The populace, disordered and manipulated by divisions of race, class, or
creed, was fickle, bloodthirsty, periodically turbulent; bribed by the
state with doles of bread, oil, and wine; diverted by horse races, beast
baitings, rope dancing, indecent pantomimes in the theater, and by
imperial or ecclesi- astical pageantry in the streets. Gambling halls
and saloons were everywhere; houses of prostitution could be found on
almost every street, sometimes “at the very church doors.” 17 Th e women
of Byzantium were famous for their licentiousness and their religious
devotion, the men for their quick intelli- gence and unscrupulous
ambition. All classes believed in magic, astrology, divination, sorcery,
witchcraft, and miraculous amulets. The Roman virtues had disappeared
even before the Latin tongue; Roman and Greek qualities had been
overwhelmed by a flood of uprooted Orientals who had lost their own
morality and had taken on no other except in words. Yet even in this
highly theological and sensual society the great majority of men and
women were decent citizens and parents, who settled down after youthful
frolics to the joys and sorrows of family life, and grudgingly performed
the work of the world. The same emperors who blinded their rivals poured
out charity to hospitals, orphanages, homes for the aged, free hostels
for travelers . 18 And in that aristocracy where luxury and ease seemed
the order of every day, there were hundreds of men who gave themselves,
with a zeal tempered by venality, to the tasks of administration and
statesmanship, and somehow man- aged, despite all overturns and
intrigues, to save the realm from every disaster, and to maintain the
most prosperous economy in the medieval Christian world.</p>
<p>The bureaucracy that Diocletian and Constantine had established had
become in seven centuries an effective engine of administration,
reaching every region of the realm. Heraclius had replaced the old
division of the Empire into provinces by a division into “themes,” or
military units ruled by</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>434</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>a strategos or military governor; this was one of a hundred ways in
which the Islamic threat modified Byzantine institutions. The themes
retained consid- erable self-government, and prospered under this
centralized rule; they re- ceived a continuity of order without bearing
the direct force of the struggles and violence that disturbed the
capital. Constantinople was ruled by the emperor, the patriach, and the
mob; the themes were governed by Byzantine law. While Islam confused law
with theology, and Western Europe floun- dered through the chaos of a
dozen barbarian codes, the Byzantine world cherished and extended the
legacy of Justinian. The “novels” or new laws of Justin II and
Heraclius, the Ecloga, or selected laws, issued by Leo III, the
Basilica, or royal edicts, promulgated by Leo VI, and the “novels” of
the same Leo, adjusted the Pandects of Justinian to the changing needs
of five centuries; codes of military, ecclesiastical, maritime,
mercantile, and rural law gave order and dependability to legal
judgments in army and clergy, in markets and ports, on the farm and the
sea; and in the eleventh century the school of law at Constantinople was
the intellectual center of secular Chris- tendom. So the Byzantines
preserved Rome’s greatest gift— Roman law- through a millennium of peril
and change, until its revival at Bologna in the twelfth century
revolutionized the civil law of Latin Europe and the canon law of the
Roman Church. The Byzantine Maritime Code of Leo III, devel- oped from
the nautical regulations of ancient Rhodes, was the first body of
commercial law in medieval Christendom; it became in the eleventh
century the source of similar codes for the Italian republics of Trani
and Amalfi; and by that lineage entered into the legal heritage of the
modern world.</p>
<p>The Rural Code was a creditable attempt to check feudalism and
establish a free peasantry. Small holdings were given to retired
soldiers; larger tracts belonging to the state were cultivated by
soldiers as a form of military serv- ice; and great areas were colonized
by heretical sects transported from Asia into Thrace and Greece. Still
vaster regions were settled, under governmental compulsion or
protection, by barbarian groups who were judged less dan- gerous within
the Empire than outside; so Goths were received into Thrace and Illyria,
Lombards into Pannonia, Slavs into Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece; by the
tenth century the Peloponnesus was predominantly Slav, and Slavs were
numerous in Attica and Thessaly. State and Church co-operated to
diminish slavery; imperial legislation forbade the sale of slaves, or
the en- slavement of a freeman, and automatically emancipated slaves who
entered the army or the clergy, or married a free person. In
Constantinople slavery was in effect limited to domestic service, but it
flourished there.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is almost a Newtonian law of history that large
agricultural holdings, in proportion to their mass and nearness, attract
smaller holdings, and, by purchase or otherwise, periodically gather the
land into great estates; in time the concentration becomes explosive,
the soil is redivided by taxation or revolution, and concentration is
resumed. By the tenth century most of</p>
<p>THE BYZANTINE WORLD</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIll)</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>the soil of the Byzantine East was owned in extensive domains by rich
land- lords ( dynatoi , “powerful men”), or by churches, monasteries, or
hospitals endowed with supporting terrain by pious legacy. Such tracts
were worked by serfs, or by coloni legally free but economically
chained. The owners, equipped with retinues of clients, guards, and
domestic slaves, led lives of refined luxury in their villas or their
city palaces. We see the good and bad of these great lords in the story
of Basil I’s benefactress, the lady Danielis. When she visited him in
Constantinople 300 slaves took turns supporting the litter, or covered
couch, in which she traveled from Patras. She brought to her imperial
protege richer presents than any sovereign had ever sent to a Byzantine
emperor; 400 youths, 100 eunuchs, and 100 maidens were but a part of her
gift; there were also 400 pieces of art-woven textiles, 100 pieces of
cambric (each sq fine that it could be enclosed in the joint of a reed),
and a dinner service in silver and gold. During her lifetime she gave
away much of her wealth; at her death she willed the rest to Basil’s
son. Leo VI found himself suddenly dowered with eighty villas and farms,
masses of coin and jewelry and plate, costly furniture, rich stuffs,
numberless cattle, thousands of slaves. 10</p>
<p>Such Greek gifts were not altogether pleasing to the emperors. The
wealth so gleaned from the flesh and sweat of millions of men gave the
owners a power collectively dangerous to any sovereign. Out of
self-interest as well as humanity, the emperors sought to halt this
process of concentration. The severe winter of 927-8 ended in famine and
plague; starving peasants sold their holdings to great landowners at
desperately low prices, or merely in exchange for subsistence. In 934
the regent Romanus issued a “novel” that</p>
<p>43 6 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>The Eastern Empire in this period acquired an urban and
semi-industrial character quite different from the ruralism of Latin
Europe north of the Alps. Miners and metallurgists actively explored and
developed the lead, iron, cop- per, and gold in the soil. Not only
Constantinople but a hundred other Byzan- tine cities — Smyrna, Tarsus,
Ephesus, Durazzo, Ragusa, Patras, Corinth, Thebes, Salonika,
Hadrianople, Heraclea, Selymbria — throbbed and re- sounded with
tanners, cobblers, saddlers, armorers, goldsmiths, jewelers,
metalworkers, carpenters, wood carvers, wheelwrights, bakers, dyers,
weav- ers, potters, mosaicists, painters As caldrons and caverns of
manufacturing</p>
<p>and exchange, Constantinople, Baghdad, and Cordova in the ninth
century almost rivaled the bustle and bedlam of a modern metropolis.
Despite Persian competition the Greek capital still led the white world
in the production of fine tissues and silks; only second to it in this
regard were Argos, Corinth, and Thebes. The textile industry was highly
organized, and used much slave labor; most other workers were free
artisans. The proletarian population of Constantinople and Salonika were
class-conscious, and staged many unsuc- cessful revolts. Their employers
formed a considerable middle class, acquisi- tive, charitable,
industrious, intelligent, and fiercely conservative. The major
industries, including their workers, artists, managers, merchants,
lawyers, and financiers, were organized into systemata, or corporation
guilds, lineally descended from the ancient collegia and artes , and
akin to the large economic units of a modern “corporative” state. Each
corporation had a monopoly in its line, but was strictly regulated by
legislation in its purchases, prices, meth- ods of manufacture, and
conditions of sale; governmental examiners kept surveillance over
operations and accounts; and at times maximum wages were fixed by law.
Minor industries, however, were left to free workers and indi- vidual
enterprise. The arrangement gave order, prosperity, and continuity to
Byzantine industry, but it checked initiative and invention, and tended
to an Oriental fixity of status and life . 20</p>
<p>Commerce was encouraged by state maintenance or supervision of docks
and ports, governmentally regulated insurance and loans on bottomry, a
vigorous war on piracy, and the most stable currency in Europe. Over all
commerce the Byzantine government exercised a pervasive control — pro-
hibited certain exports, monopolized the trade in corn and silk, charged
export and import duties, and taxed sales . 21 It almost invited its
early replace- ment as commercial mistress of the Aegean and Black Seas
by allowing for- eign merchants — Armenians, Syrians, Egyptians,
Amalfians, Pisans, Vene- tians, Genoese, Jews, Russians, and Catalans —
to carry most of its trade, and to set up semi- independent “factories”
or agencies in or near the capital. Interest charges were permitted, but
were limited by law to twelve, ten, eight per cent, or even less.
Bankers were numerous; and perhaps it was the moneylenders of
Constantinople, rather than those of Italy, who developed</p>

<p>437</p>
<p>the bill of exchange, 22 and organized the most extensive credit
system in Christendom before the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>V. THE BYZANTINE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>From the labor and skill of the people and the superfluities of the
rich there came in the ninth and tenth centuries a remarkable revival of
letters and arts. Although the Empire to its dying day called itself
Roman, nearly all Latin elements had disappeared from it except Roman
law. Since Heraclius, Greek had been the language of government,
literature, and liturgy, as well as of daily speech, in the Byzantine
East. Education was now completely Greek. Nearly every free male, many
women, even many slaves, received some education. The University of
Constantinople, which, like letters in general, had been allowed to
decay in the crises of the Heracleian age, was restored by Caesar Bardas
(863), and attained high repute for its courses in philology,
philosophy, theology, astronomy, mathematics, biology, music, and
literature; even the pagan Libanius and the godless Lucian were read.
Tuition was largely free to qualified students, and the teachers were
paid by the state. Libraries, public and private, were numerous, and
still preserved those classic masterpieces which had been forgotten in
the disordered West.</p>
<p>This ample transmission of the Greek heritage was at once stimulating
and restrictive. It sharpened and widened thought, and lured it from its
old round of homiletical eloquence and theological debate. But its very
wealth discour- aged originality; it is easier for the ignorant than for
the learned to be original. Byzantine literature was intended chiefly
for cultured and leisurely ladies and gentlemen; polished and polite,
artistic and artificial, Hellenistic but not Hel- lenic, it played on
the surface, and spared the heart, of human life. Though the churchmen
of the period were remarkably tolerant, thought of its own accord,
through habits formed in youth, stayed within the circle of ortho- doxy,
and the iconoclasts were more pious than the priests.</p>
<p>It was another Alexandrian age of scholarship. Pundits analyzed
language an d prosody, wrote epitomes, “outlines,’’ and universal
histories, compiled dictionaries, encyclopedias, anthologies. Now (917)
Constantine Cephalas collected The Greek Anthology ; now (97 6) Suidas
accumulated his ency- clopedic lexicon. Theophanes ( c . 814) and Leo
the Deacon (b. 950) wrote valuable histories of their own or recent
times. Paul of TEgina (615-90) composed an encyclopedia of medicine that
combined Moslem theory and practice with the legacy of Galen and
Oribasius; it discussed in almost mod- ern terms operations for cancer
of the breast, hemorrhoids, catheterization of the bladder, lithotomy,
castration; eunuchs were manufactured, says Paul, by crushing the
testicles of children in a hot bath. 28</p>
<p>43 8 the age of faith (chap, xviii</p>
<p>The outstanding Byzantine scientist of these centuries was an obscure
and impoverished teacher, Leo of Salonika ( c . 850), of whose existence
Constan- tinople took no notice until a caliph invited him to Baghdad.
One of his pupils, captured in war, became the slave of a Moslem
dignitary, who soon marveled at the youth’s knowledge of geometry. Al
-Mamun, learning of it, induced him to join in a discussion of
geometrical problems at the royal pal- ace, was impressed by his
performance, heard with eager curiosity his ac- count of his teacher,
and at once sent Leo an invitation to Baghdad and affluence. Leo
consulted a Byzantine official, who consulted the Emperor Theophilus,
who hastened to secure Leo with a state professorship. Leo was a
polymath, and taught and wrote on mathematics, astronomy, astrology,
medicine, and philosophy. Al-Mamun submitted to him several problems in
geometry and astronomy, and was so pleased with the replies that he
offered Theophilus eternal peace and 2000 pounds of gold if the Emperor
would lend him Leo for a while. Theophilus refused, and made Leo
Archbishop of Salonika to keep him out of al- Mamun’s reach. 24</p>
<p>Leo, Photius, and Psellus were the stellar luminaries of this age.
Photius (820?-9i), the most learned man of his time, was in six days
graduated from layman to patriarch, and belongs to religious history.
Michael Psellus ( 1018? —</p>
<ol start="80" type="1">
<li>was a man of the world and the court, an adviser of kings and
queens, a genial and orthodox Voltaire who could be brilliant on every
subject, but landed on terra firma after every theological argument or
palace revolution. He did not let his love of books dull his love of
life. He taught philosophy at the University of Constantinople, and
received the title of Prince of Philosophers. He entered a monastery,
found the monastic career too peace- ful, returned to the world, served
as prime minister from 1071 to 1078, and had time to write on politics,
science, medicine, grammar, theology, juris- prudence, music, and
history. His Chronographia recorded the intrigues and scandals of a
century (976-1078) with candor, verve, and vanity (he de- scribes
Constantine IX as “hanging on Psellus’ tongue” 23 ) . Elere, as a
sample, is a paragraph from his description of the revolt that restored
Theodora to the throne in 1055:</li>
</ol>
<p>Each 〔soldier in the crowd〕 was armed: one grasped a hatchet,
an-</p>
<p>other a battle-ax, one a bow, another a lance; some of the populace
carried heavy stones; and all ran in great disorder … to the apart-</p>
<p>ments of Theodora. . . . But she, taking refuge in a chapel, remained
deaf to all their cries. Abandoning persuasion, the crowd used force
upon her; some, drawing their daggers, threw themselves upon Theo- dora
as if to kill her. Boldly they snatched her from the sanctuary,</p>
<p>clothed her in sumptuous robes, seated her on a horse, and, circling
about her, led her to the church of St. Sophia. Now all the population,
highborn as well as low, joined in paying her homage, and all pro-</p>
<p>claimed her queen . 20</p>
<p>CHAP. XVlll) THE BYZANTINE WORLD 439</p>
<p>The personal letters of Psellus were almost as charming and revealing
as Cicero’s; his speeches, verses, and pamphlets were the talk of the
day; his malicious humor and lethal wit were an exciting stimulus amid
the ponder- ous erudition of his contemporaries. Compared with him and
Photius and Theophanes, the Alcuins, Rabani, and Gerberts of the
contemporary West were timid emigrants from barbarism into the Country
of the Mind.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous side of this Byzantine renaissance was its art.
From 726 to 842 the Iconoclastic movement prohibited the sculptural or
(with less strictness) pictorial representation of sacred beings; but in
compensation it freed the artist from a monotonous confinement within
ecclesiastical themes, and turned him to the observation, portrayal, and
decoration of secular life. The gods were replaced as subjects by the
imperial family, aris - tocratic patrons, historical events, the animals
of the forest, the plants and fruits of the field, the fond trivia of
domestic life. Basil I built in his palace the Nea, or New Church, “all
adorned,” says a contemporary, “with fine pearls, gold, shining silver,
mosaics, silks, and marble in a thousand varie- ties.” 27 Much of the
decora tion recently uncovered in St. Sophia was the work of the ninth
century. The central dome was rebuilt in 975 after an earthquake, and
then received its great mosaic of Christ seated on a rainbow; additional
mosaics were set up in 1028; the massive cathedral, like a living
organism, achieved continued life by the death and renewal of its parts.
The bronze doors installed in 838 were so renowned for excellence that
similar doors were ordered from Constantinople for the monastery of
Monte Cas- sino, the cathedral of Amalfi, and the basilica of San Paolo
outside the walls of Rome; the last pair, made in Constantinople in
1070, still survives as a testi- mony to Byzantine art.</p>
<p>The royal or “Sacred Palace,” of which the Nea formed the chapel, was
a growing congeries of chambers, reception halls, churches, baths,
pavilions, gardens, peristyles, and courts; almost every emperor added
something to it. Theophilus gave the group a new Oriental touch with a
throne room known as Triconchos, from the shell-like apses that formed
three of its sides — a plan imported from Syria. North of this he built
the Hall of the Pearl; south of it several heliaka or sunrooms, and the
Kamilas, an apartment with roof of gold, columns of green marble, and an
exceptionally fine mosaic representing on a gold ground men and women
gathering fruit. Even this mosaic was surpassed in an adjoining
structure, on whose walls green mosaic trees stood out against a golden
mosaic sky; and by the floor of the Hall of Harmony, whose marble
tesserae gave the effect of a meadow in full flower. Theophilus carried
his taste for bizarre splendor a ontrance in his palace of Magnaura: in
its audience chamber a golden plane tree overhung the throne; golden
birds sat on the branches and the throne; golden griffins lay on either
side of the royal seat, and golden lions at its foot; when a foreign
ambassador was presented, the mechanical griffins rose, the mechanical
lions stood up, swished their tails</p>
<p>44 ° THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>and roared, and the birds broke into mechanical song . 28 All this
was a frank copy of like absurdities in the palace of Harun al-Rashid at
Baghdad.</p>
<p>Constantinople was beautified with the taxes of commerce and the</p>
<p>“themes,” but enough remained to .add some lesser splendors to the
provin- cial capitals. The monasteries, rich again, rose in stately
mass: in the tenth century the Lavra and Iviron at Athos; in the
eleventh, St. Luke’s in Phocis, the Nea Moni in Chios, the convent of
Daphni near Eleusis — whose almost classic mosaics are the finest
examples of the mid-Byzantine style. Georgia, Armenia, and Asia Minor
shared in the movement, and became outposts of Byzantine art. The public
buildings of Antioch drew Moslem eulogies. In Jerusalem the chur ch of
the Holy Sepulcher was rebuilt soon after Heraclius’ victories. In
Egypt, before and after the Arab conquest, the Coptic Chris- tians
raised domed churches modest in size, but adorned with such artistry in
metal, ivory, wood and textiles that all the skills of Pharaonic,
Ptolemaic, Roman, Byzantine, and Mohammedan Egypt seemed to have reached
them as an unimpaired legacy. The Iconoclastic persecutions drove
thousands of monks from Syria, Asia Minor, and Constantinople to
southern Italy, where they were protected by the popes; through these
refugees, and through Oriental merchants, Byzantine styles of
architecture and decoration flour- ished in Bari, Otranto, Benevento,
Naples, even Rome. Ravenna continued to be Greek in art, and produced in
the seventh century the magnificent mosa- ics of St. Apollinaris in
Classe. Salonika remained Byzantine, and adorned its own St. Sophia with
somber mosaic apostles as gaunt as El Greco’s saints.</p>
<p>In all these lands and cities, as in the capital, the Byzantine
renaissance poured forth masterpieces of mosaic, miniature, pottery,
enamel, glass, wood, ivory, bronze, iron, gems, and textiles woven,
dyed, and decorated with a skill that all the world honored. Byzantine
artists made cups of blue glass decorated under the surface with golden
foliage, birds, and human fig- ures; glass vessels with a necking of
enameled arabesques and flowers; and other forms of glass so exquisite
that they were the favorite gifts of Byzan- tine emperors to foreign
potentates. Even more valued as presents were the costly robes, shawls,
copes, and dalmatics that displayed Byzantine textile art; such were
“Charlemagne’s cloak” in the cathedral of Metz, and the deli - cate
silks found at Aachen in the coffin of that king. Half the majesty that
hedged in the Greek emperor, much of the awe that exalted the patriarch,
some of the splendor that clothed the Redeemer, the Virgin, and the mar-
tyrs in the ritual of the Church, came from gorgeous vestments that
embod- ied the lives of a dozen artisans, the technique of centuries,
and the richest dyes of land and sea. The Byzantine goldsmiths and gem
cutters were at the top of their line until the thirteenth century; the
treasury of St. Mark’s at Venice is rich with the spoils of their craft.

<p>the immense mosaic, covering forty square yards, unearthed in
Istanbul in 1935 from the ruins of the palace of the Macedonian
emperors. 29 When Iconoclasm subsided, or where it did not reach, the
churches fed piety with icons painted in tempera upon wood, and
sometimes cased in enameled or jeweled frames. No miniatures in all the
history of illumination surpass the “Vision of Ezekiel” in the ninth -
century volume of Gregory Nazianzen’s sermons in the Bibliotheque
Nationale at Paris; 30 or the 400 illustrations of the “Menologus”
manuscript in the Vatican ( c . 1000); or the pictures of David in the
Paris Psalter ( c . 900). We shall find in them no perspective, no
modeling of forms through light and shade; but, as ample recompense, a
rich and sensuous coloring, a lively play of imagination, a new
knowledge of human and animal anatomy, a happy riot of beasts and birds,
of plants and flowers, among saints and deities, fountains, arcades, and
porticoes — birds pecking at fruit, bears dancing, stags and bulls
locking their horns in battle, and a leopard lifting an impious leg to
make a flowing initial for a pious phrase. 31</p>
<p>Byzantine potters had long known the art of enameling — i.e.,
applying to a terra-cotta or metal base a metallic oxide which, when
fired, fused with the base and gave it both protection and brilliance.
The art had come from the Orient to ancient Greece, had disappeared in
the third century b.c., and had reappeared in the third century a.d.
This mid-Byzantine period was rich in enamels — portrait medallions,
icons, crosses, reliquaries, cups, chalices, book covers, and ornaments
for harness and other equipage. As early as the sixth century Byzantium
received from Sasanian Persia the art of cloisonne enamel: the colored
paste was poured into surface areas confined by thin wires or metal
strips; these cloisons, soldered to a metal base, constituted the
decorative design. A famous example of Byzantine cloisonne is a
reliquary made ( c . 948) for Constantine Porphyrogenitus, and now in
Limburg; it is characteristically Byzantine in its minute and
conscientious execution, its ornate and luxurious ornament.</p>
<p>No other art has been so overwhelmingly religious as the Byzantine. A
church council of 787 laid down the law: “It is for painters to execute;
it is for the clergy to ordain the subjects and govern the procedure.”
32 Hence the somber seriousness of this art, its narrow scope of theme,
its monotony of method and style, the rarity of its ventures into
realism, humor, and com- mon life; ornate and brilliant beyond rival, it
never reached the lusty variety and scandalous secularity of mature
Gothic art. So much the more must we marvel at its victories and
influence. All Christendom from Kiev to Cadiz acknowledged its
leadership and flattered it with imitation; even China bowed to it now
and then. In its Syrian forms it shared with Persia in mold- ing the
architecture, mosaics, and decorative motives of Islamic art. Venice
modeled itself on Constantinople, and St. Mark ’s on the Church of the
Apostles there; Byzantine architecture appeared in France, and
mounted</p>
<p>44 2 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>as far north as Aachen. Illuminated manuscripts everywhere in the
West confessed Byzantine influence. The Bulgars took over Byzantine
faith and ornament; and the conversion of Vladimir to Greek Christianity
opened a dozen avenues by which Byzantine art entered into Russian
life.</p>
<p>From the fifth to the twelfth century Byzantine civilization led
Christian Europe in administration, diplomacy, revenue, manners,
culture, and art. Probably never before had there been a society so
splendidly adorned, or a religion so sensuously colorful. Like every
other civilization, it rested on the backs of serfs or slaves, and the
gold and marble of its shrines and palaces were the transmuted sweat of
workers toiling on or in the earth. Like every other culture of its
time, it was cruel; the same man who knelt before the image of the
Virgin could slaughter the children of Maurice before their father’s
eyes. There was something shallow about it, a veneer of aristocratic</p>
<p>The marvel remains that this civilization lasted so long. What hidden
re- sources, or inner vitality, enabled it to survive the victories of
Persia in Syria, the loss of Syria, Egypt, Sicily, and Spain to the
Moslems? Perhaps the same religious faith that weakened defense by
relying upon relics and miracles gave some order and discipline to a
people perennially patient, how- ever periodically turbulent, and
surrounded emperor and state with an aura of sanctity that frightened
change. The bureaucracy, collectively immortal, gave continuity and
stability through all wars and revolutions, kept internal peace,
regulated the economy, and gathered in the taxes that permitted the
Empire to expand again almost to its Justinian amplitude. Though the
pos- sessions of the caliphs were vaster than the Byzantine, their
revenues were probably less; and the looseness of Moslem government, the
inadequacy of its communications and its administrative machinery,
allowed the Abbasid dominion to disintegrate in three centuries, while
the Byzantine Empire en- dured through a millennium.</p>
<p>Byzantine civilization performed three vital functions. For a
thousand years it stood as a bulwark of Europe against Persia and
Eastern Islam. It</p>

<p>faithfully cherished and fully transmitted — until plundered by the
Crusaders in 1 204 — the recopied texts that handed down the literature,
science, and philosophy of ancient Greece. Monks fleeing Iconoclast
emperors brought Greek manuscripts to South Italy, and restored there a
knowledge of Greek letters; Greek professors, shunning Moslem and
Crusader alike, left Con- stantinople, sometimes settled in Italy, and
served as carriers of the classic germ; so year by year Italy
rediscovered Greece, until men drank them- selves drunk at the fountain
of intellectual freedom. And finally, it was Byzantium that won Bulgars
and Slavs from barbarism to Christianity, and brought the immeasurable
force of the Slavic body and soul into the life and destiny of
Europe.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE BALKANS: 558-IO57</li>
</ol>
<p>For only a few hundred miles north of Constantinople were troubled
oceans of men disdainful of letters and half in love with war. The Hun
tide had hardly ebbed when a new people of kindred blood, the Avars,
moved from Turkestan through southern Russia (558), enslaved masses of
Slavs, raided Germany to the Elbe (562), drove the Lombards into Italy
(56 8), and so ravaged the Balkans that the Latin-speaking population
there was almost wiped out. For a time the power of the Avars reached
from the Baltic to the Black Sea. In 626 they be- sieged and almost
captured Constantinople; their failure began their decline; in 805 they
were conquered by Charlemagne; and gradually they were absorbed by the
Bulgars and the Slavs.</p>
<p>The Bulgars, originally a mixture of Hun, Ugrian, and Turkish blood,
had formed part of the Hun empire in Russia. After Attila’s death one
branch estab - lished a kingdom — “Old Bulgaria”— along the Volga around
the modern Kazan; their capital, Bolgar, was enriched by the river
trade, and prospered till it was de- stroyed by the Tatars in the
thirteenth century. In the fifth century another branch migrated
southwest to the valley of the Don; one tribe of these, the Uti- gurs,
crossed the Danube (679), founded a second Bulgarian kingdom in the an-
cient Moesia, enslaved the Slavs there, adopted their language and
institutions, and were ultimately absorbed into the Slavic stock. The
new state reached its zenith under the Khagan or Khan (Chief) Krum
(802), a man of barbarian cour- age and civilized cunning. He invaded
Macedonia — a province of the Eastern Empire — captured 1 100 pounds of
gold, and burned the town of Sardica, now, as Sofia, Bulgaria’s ca
pital.</p>
<p>The Emperor Nicephorus bettered the instruction by burning Pliska,
Krum’s capital (81 1), but Krum trapped and destroyed the Greek army in
a mountain pass, slew Nicephorus, and made the imperial skull his
drinking cup. In 8 1 3 he besieged Constantinople, fired its suburbs,
and devastated Thrace, rehearsing the events of 1913. He was preparing
another attack when he burst a blood vessel and died. His son Omurtag
made peace with the Greeks, who yielded to him half of Thrace. Under
Khan Boris (852-88) Bulgaria adopted Christianity. Boris him-</p>
<p>444 THE AGE OE faith (chap. xviii</p>
<p>self, after a long reign, entered a monastery; emerged four years
later to depose his elder son Vladimir and enthrone his younger son
Simeon; lived till 907, and wa s canonized as the first of Bulgaria’s
national saints. Simeon (893 -927) became one of the great kings of his
time; he extended his rule to Serbia and the Adriatic, called himself
“Emperor and Autocrat of All the Bulgars and Greeks,” and re - peatedly
made war against Byzantium; but he tried to civilize his people with
translated Greek literature, and to beautify his Danubian capital with
Greek art. A contemporary describes Preslav as “a marvel to behold,”
full of “high palaces and churches” richly ado rned; in the thirteenth
century it was the largest city in the Balkans; some scanty ruins
remain. After Simeon’s death Bulgaria was weak - ened with civil strife.
Bogomil heretics converted half the peasantry to pacifism and communism;
Serbia recovered its independence in 931; the Emperor John Tzimisces
reconquered eastern Bulgaria for the Greek Empire in 972; Basil II
conquered western Bulgaria in 1014; and Bulgaria became again
(1018-1186) a province of Byzantium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile that harassed Empire had received a visit (934-42) from a
new barbarian horde. The Magyars, like the Bulgars, were probably
derived from those tribes, loosely named Ugri or Igurs (whence ogre ) ,
who wandered on the western confines of China; they too had, through
long association, a strong infusion of Hun and Turkish blood; they spoke
a tongue closely re- lated to those of the Finns and the Samoyeds. In
the ninth century they migrated from the Ural-Caspian steppes to the
lands adjoining the Don, the Dnieper, and the Black Sea. There they
lived by tilling the soil in sum- mer, fishing in winter, and at all
seasons capturing and selling Slavs as slaves to the Greeks. After some
sixty years in the Ukraine they again moved westward. Europe was then at
nadir; no strong government existed west of Constantinople; no united
army stood in the way. In 889 the Magyars over- ran Bessarabia and
Moldavia; in 895, under their chieftain Arpad, they began their
permanent conquest of Hungary; in 899 they poured over the Alps into
Italy, burned Pavia and all its forty-three churches, massacred the
inhabitants, and for an entire year ravaged the peninsula. They
conquered Pannonia, raided Bavaria (900-7) , devastated Carinthia (901 )
, took Moravia (906), plundered Saxony, Thuringia, Swabia (913),
southern Germany, and Alsace (917), and overwhelmed the Germans on the
Lech, a tributary of the Danube (924). All Europe trembled and prayed,
for these invaders were still pagan, and all Christendom seemed doomed.
But in 933 the Mag- yars were defeated at Gotha, and their advance was
stayed. In 943 they again invaded Italy; in 955 they pillaged Burgundy.
At last in that year the united armies of Germany, under Otto I, won a
decisive victory on the Lechfeld, or valley of the Lech, near Augsburg;
and Europe, having in one terrible century (841-955) fought the Normans
in the north, the Moslems in the south, and the Magyars in the east,
could breathe among its ruins.</p>
<p>The Magyars, subdued, made Europe more secure by accepting Chris-</p>

<p>tianity (975). Prince Geza feared the absorption of Hungary into the
re- expanding Byzantine Empire; he chose Latin Christianity to win peace
in the West, and married his son Stephen to Gisela, daughter of Henry
II, Duke of Bavaria. Stephen I (997- 1038) became Hungary’s patron saint
and greatest king; he organized the Magyars on the lines of German
feudalism, and accentuated the religious basis of the new society by
accepting the king- dom and crown of Hungary from Pope Sylvester II
(1000). Benedictine monks flocked in, built monasteries and villages,
and introduced Western techniques of agriculture and industry. So, after
a century of war, Hungary passed from barbarism to civilization; and
when Queen Gisela presented a cross to a German friend it was already a
masterpiece of the goldsmith’s art.</p>
<p>The earliest known home of the Slavs was a marshy region of Russia
enclosed by Kiev, Mohilev, and Brest-Litovsk. They were of Indo-European
stock, and spoke languages related to German and Persian. Periodically
overrun by nomad hordes, often enslaved, always oppressed and poor, they
grew patient and strong through endless hardships; and the fertility of
their women overcame the high mortality born of famine, disease, and
chronic war. They lived in caves or mud huts; hunted, herded, fished,
and tended bees; sold honey, wax, and skins; and slowly resigned
themselves to settled tillage. Themselves hunted even into hardly
accessible marshes and forests, brutally captured and callously sold,
they adopted the morals of their time, and bartered men for goods.
Inhabiting a cold and damp terrain, they warmed themselves with strong
liquor; they found Christianity pref- erable to Mohammedanism, which
forbade alcoholic drinks . 34 Drunkenness, un- cleanliness, cruelty, and
a passion for pillage were their outstanding faults; thrift, caution,
and imagination hovered in them between virtue and vice; but also they
were good-natured, hospitable, sociable, and loved games, dances, music,
and song. The chieftains were polygamous, the poor monogamous, the women
— bought or captured for marriage — were anomalously faithful and
obedient . 35 The patriarchal families were loosely organized in clans,
and these in tribes. The clans may have owned property in common in
their early pastoral stage; 36 but the growth of agriculture — in which
different degrees of energy and ability, on di- verse soils, produced
unequal results — generated private or family property. Fre- quently
divided by migration and fraternal war, the Slavs developed a variety of
Slavonic languages: Polish, Wendish, Czech, and Slovak in the west;
Slovene, Serbo-Croat, and Bulgarian in the south; Great Russian, White
Russian, and Lit- tle Russian (Ruthenian and Ukrainian) in the east;
nearly all of these, however, have remained intelligible to the speakers
of any one of them. Pan-Slavism of speech and customs, along with space,
resources, and a vitality born of hard con- ditions, rigorous selection,
and simple food, made the spreading power of the Slavs.</p>
<p>As the German tribes moved south and west in their migrations into
Italy and Gaul, an area of low population pressure was left behind them
in north and cen- tral Germany; drawn into this vacuum, and prodded by
the invading Huns, the Slavs expanded westward across the Vistula even
to the Elbe; in these lands they became the Wends, Poles, Czechs,
Vlachs, and Slovaks of later history. Towards</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>446</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>the end of the sixth century a torrent of Slav immigration flooded
rural Greece. The cities closed their gates against it, but a strong
Slavonic infusion entered the Hellenic blood. About 640 two kindred Slav
tribes, the Srbi and the Chrobati, repeopled Pannonia and Illyricum. The
Serbs accepted Greek, the Croats Roman, Christianity; this religious
division, crossing ethnic and linguistic unity, weakened the nation
against its neighbors, and Serbia fluctuated between independence and
subjection to Byzantium or Bulgaria. In 989 the Bulgarian Tsar Samuel,
having defeated and captured the Serbian John Vladimir, gave him his
daughter Kossara in marriage, and allowed him to return to Zita, his
capital, as a vassal prince; this is the theme of the oldest Serb novel,
Vladimir and Kossara, written in the thir- teenth century. The coastal
cities of the ancient Dalmatia — Zara, Spalato, Ragusa — retained their
Latin language and culture; the remainder of Serbia became Slav. Prince
Voislav freed Serbia in 1042; but in the twelfth century it again
acknowl- edged the suzerainty of Byzantium.</p>
<p>When, at the end of the eighth century, this amazing migration of the
Slavs was complete, all central Europe, the Balkans, and Russia were a
Slavic sea beating upon the borders of Constantinople, Greece, and
Germany.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE BIRTH OF RUSSIA: 509-IO54</li>
</ol>
<p>The Slavs were but the latest of many peoples who rejoiced in the
rich soil, spacious steppes, and many navigable rivers of Russia, and
mourned the miasmic marshes and forbidding forests, and the absence of
natural bar- riers to hostile invasion, summer’s heat, or winter’s cold.
On its least in - hospitable coasts — the western and northern fringes
of the Black Sea — the Greeks had founded a score of towns — Olbia,
Tanais, Theodosia, Panti- capeum (Kerch) . . . — as early as the seventh
century b.c.; and had engaged in trade and war with the Scythians of the
hinterland. These natives, proba- bly of Iranian origin, imbibed some
civilization from the Persians and the Greeks, and even produced a
philosopher — Anacharsis (600 b.c.) — who came to Athens and argued with
Solon.</p>
<p>During the second century b.c. another Iranian tribe, the Sarmatians,
con- quered and displaced the Scythians; and amid this turmoil the Greek
colo- nies decayed. In the second century a.d. the Goths entered from
the west, and established the Ostrogothic kingdom; about 375 this was
overthrown by the Huns; and thereafter, for centuries, the southern
plains of Russia saw hardly any civilization, but rather a succession of
nomad hordes — Bulgars, Avars, Slavs, Khazars, Magyars, Patzinaks,
Cumans, and Mongols. The Khazars were of Turkish origin; in the seventh
century they expanded through the Caucasus into south Russia,
established an orderly dominion from the Dnieper to the Caspian Sea, and
built a capital, Itil, at a mouth of the Volga near the present
Astrakhan. Their kings and upper classes accepted the Jewish religion;
hemmed in between a Moslem and a Christian empire,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVTir) THE BYZANTINE WORLD 447</p>
<p>they probably preferred to displease both equally rather than one
danger- ously; at the same time they gave full freedom to the varied
creeds of the people. Seven courts administered justice — two for
Moslems, two for Chris- tians, two for Jews, one for heathens; an appeal
was allowed from the last five to the Moslem courts, whose
administration of justice was at that time con- sidered best . 87
Encouraged by this enlightened policy, merchants of various faiths
gathered in the Khazar towns; a lively trade developed there between the
Baltic and the Caspian Seas, and Itil, in the eighth century, was one of
the great commercial cities of the world. In the ninth century Khazaria
was over- run by Turkish nomads; the government could no longer protect
its trade channels from brigandage and piracy; and in the tenth century
the Khazar kingdom melted away into the ethnic chaos from which it had
taken form.</p>
<p>Into that motley multitude of south and central Russia in the sixth
century came a migration of Slavic tribes from the Carpathian Mountains.
They settled the valleys of the Dnieper and the Don, and reached out
more thinly to Lake Ilmen in the north. For centuries they multiplied,
year by year clear- ing the forests, draining the swamps, eliminating
wild beasts, creating the Ukraine. They spread over the plains in a
movement of human fertility rivaled only by the Hindus and the Chinese.
All through known history they have been on the march — into the
Caucasus and Turkestan, into the Urals and Siberia; this process of
colonization goes on today, and the Slav ocean every year enters new
ethnic bays.</p>
<p>Early in the ninth century an apparently negligible attack came upon
Slav- dom from the northwest. The Scandinavian Vikings could spare men
and en- ergy from their assaults upon Scotland, Iceland, Ireland,
England, Germany, France, and Spain to send into northern Russia bands
of one or two hundred men to prey upon the communities of Balts, Finns,
and Slavs, and then return with their booty. To protect their robberies
with law and order, these Vae- ringjar or Varangians (“followers”— of a
chieftain) established fortified posts on their routes, and gradually
they settled down as a ruling Scandinavian minority of armed merchants
among a subject peasantry. Some towns hired them as guardians of social
order and security; apparently the guardians con- verted their wages
into tribute, and became the masters of their employers . 88 By the
middle of the ninth century they governed Novgorod (“new fort”) and had
extended their rule as far south as Kiev. The routes and settlements
they controlled were loosely bound into a commercial and political
empire called Ros or Rus, a term of much disputed derivation. The great
rivers that traversed the land connected — through canals and short
overland hauls — the Baltic and Black Seas, and invited a southward
expansion of Varangian trade and power; soon these fearless merchant-
warriors were selling their goods or services in Constantinople itself.
Conversely, as commerce grew more reg- ular on the Dnieper, the Volkhov,
and the Western Dvina, Moslem mer- chants came up from Baghdad and
Byzantium and traded spices, wines, silks,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>448</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>and gems for furs, amber, honey, wax, and slaves; hence the great
number of Islamic and Byzantine coins found along these rivers, and even
in Scandi- navia. As Moslem control of the eastern Mediterranean blocked
the flow of European products through French and Italian outlets to
Levantine ports, Marseille, Genoa, and Pisa declined in the ninth and
tenth centuries, while in Russia towns like Novgorod, Smolensk,
Chernigov, Kiev, and Rostov flourished through Scandinavian, Slavic,
Moslem, and Byzantine trade.</p>
<p>The Ancient Chronicle of Russia (twelfth century) gave personality to
this Scandinavian infiltration by its tale of “three princes”: the
Finnish and Slavic population of Novgorod and its vicinity, having
driven out their Varangian overlords, fell to so much quarreling among
themselves that they invited the Varangians to send them a ruler or
general (862) . Three brothers came, says the story — Rurik, Sineus, and
Truvor — and established the Russian state. The story may be true,
despite latter-day skepticism; or it may be a patriotic gloss on a
Scandinavian conquest of Novgorod. The Chronicle further relates that
Rurik sent two of his aides, Askold and Dir, to take Con- stantinople;
that these Vikings stopped en route to capture Kiev, and then declared
themselves independent of both Rurik and the Khazars. In 860 Kiev was
strong enough to send a fleet of 200 vessels to attack Constantinople;
the expedition failed, but Kiev remained the commercial and political
focus of Russia. It gathered under its power an extensive hinterland;
and its earliest rulers — Askold, Oleg, and Igor — rather than Rurik at
Novgorod, might justly be called the founders of the Russian state.
Oleg, Igor and the able Princess Olga (Igor’s widow), and her warrior
son Sviatoslav (962 -72) widened the Kievan realm until it embraced
nearly all the eastern Slavonic tribes, and the towns of Polotsk,
Smolensk, Chernigov, and Rostov. Between 860 and 1043 the young
principality made six attempts to take Constantinople; so old is the
Russian drive to the Bosporus, the Russian hunger for secure access to
the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>With Vladimir (972- 1015), fifth “Grand Duke of Kiev,” Rus, as the
new principality called itself, became Christian (989). Vladimir married
the sister of the Emperor Basil II, and thereafter, till 1917, Russia,
in religion, alphabet, coinage, and art, was a daughter of Byzantium.
Greek priests explained to Vladimir the divine origin and right of
kings, and the usefulness of this doc- trine in promoting social order
and monarchical stability. 30 Under Vladimir’s son Yaroslav (1036-54)
the Kievan state reached its zenith. Its authority was loosely
acknowledged, and taxes were received by it, from Lake Ladoga and the
Baltic to the Caspian, the Caucasus, and the Black Sea. The Scandinavian
invaders were absorbed, and Slav blood and speech prevailed. Social
organ- ization was frankly aristocratic; the prince entrusted
administration and de- fense to a higher nobility of boyars, and a
lesser nobility of dietski or otroki — pages or retainers; below these
came the merchants, the townspeople, the semiservile peasantry, and the
slaves. A code of laws — Russkaya Pravda, or</p>

<p>449</p>
<p>Russian Right — sanctioned private revenge, the judicial duel, and
the com- purgative oath, but established trial by a jury of twelve
citizens. 40 Vladimir founded a school for boys at Kiev, Yaroslav
another at Novgorod. Kiev, the meeting point of btiats from the Volkhov,
the Dvina, and the lower Dnieper, took toll of all passing merchandise.
Soon it was rich enough to build 400 churches and a great cathedral —
another St. Sophia — in the Byzantine style. Greek artists were imported
to decorate these buildings with mosaics, fres- coes, and other
Byzantine ornament; and Greek music entered to prepare for the triumphs
of Russian choral song. Slowly Russia lifted itself out of its dirt and
dust, built palaces for its princes, raised cupolas above huts of mud,
and out of the patient strength of its people reared little isles of
civilization in a still barbarous sea.</p>
