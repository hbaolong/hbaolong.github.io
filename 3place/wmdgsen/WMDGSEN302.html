<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>XThe Decline of the West</p>
<p>566-1066</p>
<p>W HILE Islam was on the march, and Byzantium was recovering from
seemingly fatal blows, Europe fought its way up through the “Dark</p>
<p>Ages.” This is a loose term, whi ch any man may define to his
prejudice; we shall arbitrarily confine it to non-Byzantine Europe
between the death of Boethius in 524 and the birth of Abelard in 1079.
Byzantine civilization con- tinued to flourish during this period,
despite severe losses of territory and prestige. But Western Europe in
the sixth century was a chaos of conquest, disintegration, and
rebarbarization. Much of the classic culture survived, for the most part
silent and hidden in a few monasteries and families. But the physical
and psychological foundations of social order had been so disturbed that
centuries would be needed to restore them. Love of letters, devotion to
art, the unity and continuity of culture, the cross-fertilization of
communi- cating minds, fell before the convulsions of war, the perils of
transport, the economies of poverty, the rise of vernaculars, the
disappearance of Latin from the East and of Greek from the West. In the
ninth and tenth centuries the Moslem control of the Mediterranean, the
raiding of European coasts and towns by Normans, Magyars, and Saracens
accelerated this localism of life and defense, this primitivism of
thought and speech. Germany and East- ern Europe were a maelstrom of
migrations, Scandinavia was a pirates’ lair, Britain was overrun by
Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Danes; Gaul by Franks, Normans, Burgundians,
and Goths; Spain was torn between Visigoths and Moors; Italy had been
shattered by the long war between the Goths and Byzantium, and the land
that had given order to half the world suffered for five centuries a
disintegration of morals, economy, and government.</p>
<p>And yet during that long darkness Charlemagne, Alfred, and Otto I
gave intervals of order and stimulus to France, England, and Germany;
Erigena resurrected philosophy, Alcuin and others restored education,
Gerbert im- ported Moslem science into Christendom, Leo IX and Gregory
VII re- formed and strengthened the Church, architecture developed the
Roman- esque style; and Europe began in the eleventh century its slow
ascent to the twelfth and thirteenth, the greatest of medieval
centuries.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p>CHAP. XTX)</p>
<p>THE DECLINE OF THE WEST</p>
<p>451</p>
<p>I. ITALY: 566-IO95</p>
<p>I. The Lombards: 8-774</p>
<p>Three years after the death of Justinian, Byzantine rule was
extinguished in northern Italy by the Lombard invasion.</p>
<p>Paul the Deacon, who was one of them, thought that the Lombards or
Longobardi owed their name to their long beards. 1 They themselves
believed that their original home had been Scandinavia, 2 and so Dante,
their descend- ant, 3 apostrophized them. 4 We find them on the lower
Elbe in the first cen- tury, on the Danube in the sixth, used by Narses
in his Italian campaign of 552, sent back to Pannonia after his victory,
but never forgetting the fruitful loveliness of northern Italy. In 568,
pressed on north and east by Avars, 1 30,- 000 Lombards — men, women,
children, and baggage — moved laboriously across the Alps into
“Lombardy,” the lush plains of the Po. Narses, who might have stopped
them, had been deposed and disgraced a year before; Byzantium was busy
with Avars and Persians; Italy itself, exhausted by the Gothic War, had
no stomach for fighting, no money to pay for vicarious heroism. By 573
the Lombards held Verona, Milan, Florence, and Pavia — which became
their capital; in 601, they captured Padua, in 603 Cremona and Mantua,
in 640 Genoa. Their mightiest king, Liutprand (712-44), took Ravenna in
eastern Italy, Spoleto in the center, Benevento in the south, and
aspired to unite all Italy under his rule. Pope Gregory III could not
allow the papacy to become a Lombard bishopric; he called in the
unsubdued Vene- tians, who retook Ravenna for Bvzantium. Liutprand had
to content himself with giving northern and central Italy the best
government they had had since Theodoric the Goth. Like Theodoric, he
could not read. 5</p>
<p>The Lombards developed a progressive civilization. The king was
elected and advised by a council of notables, and usually submitted his
legislation to a popular assembly of all free males of military age.
King Rathari (643) pub- lished a code of laws at once primitive and
advanced: it allowed money com- pensation for murder, proposed to
protect the poor against the rich, ridiculed the belief in witchcraft,
and gave freedom of worship to Catholic, Arian, and pagan alike. 6
Intermarriage absorbed the Germanic invaders into the Italian blood and
won them to the Latin tongue; the Lombards left their signature here and
there in blue eyes, blond hair, and a few Teutonic words in Italian
speech. As the conquest subsided into law, the commerce natural to the
valley of the Po was resumed; by the end of the Lombard period the
cities of north- ern Italy were rich and strong, ready for the arts and
wars of their medieval peak. Literature faltered; from this age and
realm time has preserved only one book of significance — Paul the
Deacon’s History of the Lombards ( c .</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>452</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>X748); it is dull, poorly arranged, and without a grain of
philosophic salt. But Lombardy left its name on architecture and
finance. The building trades had retained some of their old Roman
organization and skill; one group, the magistri Comacini, or masters of
Como, took the lead in compounding a “Lombard” style of architecture
that would later ripen into Romanesque.</p>
<p>Within a generation after Liutprand the Lombard kingdom broke against
the rock of the papacy. King Aistulf seized Ravenna in 75 1 , and ended
the Byzantine exarchate. As the ducatus Romanos or duchy of Rome had
been legally under the exarch, Aistulf claimed Rome as part of his
widened realm. Pope Stephen II called upon Constantine Copronymus for
aid; the Greek emperor sent a harmless note to Aistulf; Stephen, in a
move of endless results, appealed to Pepin the Short, King of the
Franks. Scenting empire, Pepin crossed the Alps, overwhelmed Aistulf,
made Lombardy a Frank fief, and gave all central Italy to the papacy.
The popes continued to acknowledge the formal suzerainty of the Eastern
emperors, but Byzantine authority was now ended in northern Italy. The
Lombard vassal King Desiderius tried to restore the independence and
conquests of Lombardy; Pope Hadrian I sum- moned a new Frank;
Charlemagne swept down upon Pavia, consigned Des- iderius to a
monastery, ended the Lombard kingdom, and made it a province of the
Franks (774).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Normans in Italy : 1036-85</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy was now abandoned to a thousand years of divided and alien
rule, whose details we shall not chronicle. In 1036 the Normans began
the con- quest of southern Italy from the Byzantine power. The lords of
Normandy were wont to transmit land to all sons equally, as in modern
France; but whereas in France the law resulted in small families, in
medieval Normandy it resulted in small holdings. With no taste for
peaceful poverty, and with a zest for adventure and rapine still warm in
their Viking memories, some lusty Normans hired themselves out to the
rival dukes of southern Italy, fought valiantly for and against
Benevento, Salerno, Naples, and Capua, and were given the town of Aversa
as their reward. Other Norman young bloods, hearing of lands to be won
for a blow or two, left Normandy for Italy. Soon the Normans there
numbered enough to fight for themselves; and by 1053 the boldest of
them, Robert Guiscard (i.e., the Wise or Wily), had carved out a Norman
kingdom in southern Italy. He was such stuff as myths are made of:
taller than any of his soldiers, strong of arm and will, fair of fea-
tures, blond of hair and beard, splendid in dress, greedy and liberal of
gold, occasionally cruel, always brave.</p>
<p>Recognizing no law but force and guile, Robert overran Calabria, took
Benevento almost over the dead body of Pope Leo IX ( 1054) , struck
alliance</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 453</p>
<p>with Nicholas II, pledged him tribute and vassalage, and received
from him title to Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily (1059). Leaving his
younger brother Roger to conquer Sicily, he himself captured Bari
(1071), and drove the Byzantines from Apulia. Fretting at the Adriatic
barrier, he dreamed of crossing it, taking Constantinople, and making
himself the mightiest monarch in Europe. He improvised a fleet, and
defeated the Byzantine navy off Du- razzo (1081). Byzantium appealed to
Venice; Venice responded, for she could not be less than queen of the
Adriatic; and in 1082 her skillful galleys routed Guiscard’s ships not
far from the site of his recent victory. But in the following year
Robert, with Caesarean energy, transported his army to Durazzo, defeated
there the forces of Alexius I, the Greek Emperor, and marched across
Epirus and Thessaly almost to Salonika. Then, on the verge of realizing
his dream, he received a desperate appeal from Pope Gregory VII to come
and save him from the Emperor Henry IV. Leaving his army in Thessaly,
Robert hurried back to Italy, raised a new force of Normans, Ital- ians,
and Saracens, rescued the Pope, captured Rome from the Germans,
suppressed an uprising of the people against his army, and allowed his
angry soldiers to burn and sack the city so thoroughly that not even the
Vandals of 45 1 could equal this destructiveness (1084) . Meanwhile his
son Bohemond returned to confess that his army in Greece had been
destroyed by Alexius. The old buccaneer built a third fleet, defeated
the Venetian navy off Corfu (1084), took the Ionian isle of Cephalonia,
and died there, of infection or poison, at the age of seventy (1085). He
was the first and greatest of the condottieri , the robber captains of
Italy.</p>
<p>3 . Venice : 4.51-1095</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the northern end of the peninsula, a new state had been
born, destined to grow in power and splendor while most of Italy
withered in anarchy. In the barbarian invasions of the fifth and sixth
centuries — above all during the Lombard invasion of 568 — the
populations of Aquileia, Padua, Belluno, Feltre, and other towns fled
for safety to join the fisher folk who dwelt in the little islands
formed by the Piave and Adige Rivers at the head of the Adriatic Sea.
Some refugees remained after the crises passed, and founded the
communities of Heraclea, Melamocco, Grado, Lido . . . and Rivo Alto
(Deep River) — which, as Rialto, became the seat of their united
government (81 1). A tribe of Veneti had occupied northeastern Italy
long before Caesar; in the thirteenth century the name Venezia was
applied to the unique city that had grown from the refugee
settlements.</p>
<p>Life was hard there at first. Fresh water was difficult to secure,
and was valued like wine. Forced to market on the mainland, in exchange
for wheat and other commodities, the fish and salt that they drew from
the sea, the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>454</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>XVenetians became a people of boats and trade. Gradually the commerce
of northern and central Europe with the Near East flowed through
Venetian ports. The new federation, to protect itself from Germans and
Lombards, acknowledged Byzantium as its overlord; but the
inaccessibility of the islands, in their shallow waters, to attack by
land or sea, the industry and fortitude of the citizens, the mounting
wealth of their spreading trade, gave the little state an unbroken
sovereignty through a thousand years.</p>
<p>Twelve tribunes — apparently one for each of the twelve principal
islands — managed the government till 697, when the communities, feeling
the need of a united authority, chose their first dux or doge — leader
or duke — to serve until death or revolution should depose him. Doge
Agnello Badoer (809-27) so skillfully defended the city against the
Franks that the doges were chosen from his descendants till 942. Under
Orseolo II (991-1008) Venice revenged herself against the raids of
Dalmatian pirates by storming their lairs, absorb- ing Dalmatia, and
establishing her control over the Adriatic. In 998 the Venetians began
to celebrate, on every Ascension Day, this maritime victory and mastery
by the symbolic ceremony of the sposalizia : the doge, from a gaily
decorated galley, flung into the open waters a consecrated ring, and
cried in Latin: “We marry you, the sea, in sign of our true and
perpetual</p>
<p>In 1033 an aristocracy of commerce ended the hereditary transmission
of the ducal power, returned to the principle of election by an assembly
of citi- zens, and compelled the doge henceforth to govern in
collaboration with a senate. By this time Venice was already called “the
golden” ( Venetia aurea ), and her people were famous for their
luxurious dress, their wide- spread literacy, and their civic devotion
and pride. They were a restlessly acquisitive tribe, clever and subtle,
courageous and quarrelsome, pious and unscrupulous; they sold Christian
slaves to the Saracens, 8 and with part of the profit they built shrines
to the saints. The Rialto shops had able craftsmen who inherited the
industrial skills of Roman Italy; a busy local trade moved along the
canals, silently but for the terse cries of the gondoliers; the island
quays were picturesque with adventurous galleys laden with the products
of Europe and the East. Mercantile voyages were financed by capitalist
loans, paying normally twenty per cent. 9 The gap between rich (
maggiori ) and poor (jninori) widened as the rich became vastly richer,
the poor only slightly less poor. No mercy was shown to simplicity. The
race went to the swift, the battle to the strong. The minori walked on
bare ground, and the refuse of their houses ran along the streets and
into the canals; the maggiori built splendid palaces, and sought to
appease God and the people with the most ornate cathedral in the Latin
world. The Palace of the Doges, first raised</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 455</p>
<p>in 814, burnt in 976, bore many changes of face and figure before
finding its graceful blend of Moorish ornament and Renaissance form.</p>
<p>In 828 some Venetian merchants stole from an Alexandrian church what
purported to be the relics of St. Mark. Venice made the apostle her
patron saint, and ravaged half the world to enshrine his bones. The
first St. Mark’s, begun in 830, was so damaged by fire in 976 that Peter
Orseolo II began a new and larger edifice. Byzantine artisans were
summoned, who modeled it on Justinian’s church of the Holy Apostles in
Constantinople— with five domes over a cruciform plan. For nearly a
century the work proceeded; the main structure was finished in
substantially its present form in 1071, and was consecrated in 1095. The
relics of St. Mark having been lost in the fire of 976, and their
absence threatening the sanctity of the cathedral, it was arranged that
on the day of consecration the worshipers should gather in the church
and pray that the relics might be found. According to a tradition dear
to good Venetians, a pillar succumbed to their orisons, fell to the
ground, and revealed the evangelical bones. 10 The building was
repeatedly damaged and repaired; hardly a decade but saw some alteration
or embellishment; the St. Mark’s that we know is of no one date or
period, but is a stone and jewel record of a millennium. Marble facings
were added to the brick walls in the twelfth century; columns of every
variety were imported from a dozen cities; Byzantine artists naturalized
in Venice executed mosaics for the cathe- dral in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries; four bronze horses were appro- priated from
conquered Constantinople in 1204, and were placed over the main portal;
Gothic artists in the fourteenth century added pinnacles, win- dow
tracery, and a sanctuary screen; and in the seventeenth century Renais-
sance painters covered half the mosaics with indifferent murals. Through
all these changes and *centuries the strange edifice kept its character
and unity — always Byzantine and Arabic, ornate and bizarre: the
exterior overwhelm- ingly brilliant with arches, buttresses, spires,
pillars, portals, pinnacles, en- crusted polychrome marble, carved
cornices, and stately bulbous domes; the interior with its dark
wilderness of colored columns, carved or painted span- drels, somber
frescoes, 5000 square yards of mosaic, floor inlaid with jasper,
porphyry, agate, and other precious stones; and the Pala (Toro, or
golden reredos, made of costly metals and cloisonne enamel in
Constantinople in 976, overloaded with 2400 gems, and set up behind the
main altar in 1 105. In St. Mark’s, as in St. Sophia’s, the Byzantine
passion for decoration outran itself. God was to be honored with marble
and jewelry; man was to be terri- fied, disciplined, encouraged, and
consoled by a hundred scenes from the Christian epic, from the creation
to the destruction of the world. St. Mark’s was the supreme and
characteristic expression of a Latin people exuberantly won to an
Oriental art.</p>
<p>45&lt;5</p>
<p>THE AGE GF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>X4. Italian Civilization: 566-1095</p>
<p>While eastern and southern Italy remained Byzantine in culture, the
rest of the peninsula evolved a new civilization — a new language,
religion, and art — from its Roman heritage. For even amid invasion,
chaos, and poverty, that heritage was never wholly lost. The Italian
language was the rude Latin of the ancient populace, transforming itself
slowly into the most melodious of all tongues. Italian Christianity was
a romantic and colorful paganism, an affectionate polytheism of local
and protective saints, a frank mythology of legend and miracle. Italian
art suspected Gothic as barbarous, clung to the basilican style, and
finally, in the Renaissance, returned to Augustan forms. Feudalism never
prospered in Italy; the cities never lost their ascendancy over the
countryside; industry and commerce, not agriculture, paved the roads to
wealth.</p>
<p>Rome, never a commercial city, continued to decline. Its senate had
per- ished in the Gothic War; its ancient municipal institutions, after
700, were empty tools and rebel dreams. The motley populace, living in a
squalor alle- viated by sexual license and papal alms, could express its
political emotions only by frequent uprisings against foreign masters or
disfavored popes. The old aristocratic families spent their time
competing with one another for con- trol of the papacy, or with the
papacy for control of Rome. Where consuls, tribunes, and senators had
once forged laws with rods and axes, social order was now barely
sustained by the decrees of ecclesiastical councils, the ser- mons and
agents of bishops, and the dubious example of thousands of monks, of
every nationality, not seldom idle and not always celibate. The Church
had denounced the promiscuity of the public baths; the great halls and
pools of the thermae were deserted, and the pagan art of cleanliness was
in decay. The imperial aqueducts having been ruined by neglect or war,
the people drank the waters of the Tiber. 11 The Circus Maximus and the
Colosseum, of bloody memory, were no longer used; the Forum began in the
seventh century to revert to the cow pasture from which it had been
formed; the Capitol was paved with mire; old temples and public
buildings were dismem- bered to provide material for Christian churches
and palaces. Rome suffered more from Romans than from Vandals and Goths.
12 The Rome of Caesar was dead, and the Rome of Leo X had yet to be
born.</p>
<p>The old libraries were scattered or destroyed, and intellectual life
was almost confined to the Church. Science succumbed to the superstition
that gives romance to poverty. Only medicine kept its head up, clinging
with monastic hands to the Galenic heritage. Perhaps out of a
Benedictine mon- astery at Salerno, in the ninth century, a lay medical
school took form which bridged the gap between ancient and medieval
medicine, as Hellenized south Italy bridged the gap between Greek and
medieval culture. Salerno had</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 457</p>
<p>been a health resort for over a thousand years. Local tradition
described its collegium Hippocraticum as composed of ten physician
instructors, of whom one was a Greek, one a Saracen, one a Jew. 13 About
the year 1060 Constantine “the African,” a Roman citizen who had studied
medicine in the Moslem schools of Africa and Baghdad, brought to Monte
Cassino (where he became a monk) and to nearby Salerno an exciting cargo
of Islamic medical lore. His translations of Greek and Arabic works in
medi- cine and other fields shared in the resurrection of science in
Italy. At his death ( c . 1087) the school of Salerno stood at the head
of medical knowl- edge in the Christian West.</p>
<p>The distinctive achievement of art in this age was the establishment
of the Romanesque architectural style (774-1200). Inheriting the Roman
tra- dition of solidity and permanence, the Italian builders thickened
the walls of the basilica, crossed the nave with a transept, added
towers or attached pillars as buttresses, and supported with columns or
clustered piers the arches that upheld the roof. The characteristic
Romanesque arch was a simple semicircle, a form of noble dignity, better
fitted to span a space than to bear a weight. In early Romanesque the
aisles — in later Romanesque the nave and aisles — were vaulted, i.e.,
roofed with arched masonry. The exterior was usually plain, and of
unfaced brick. The interior, though moderately adorned with mosaics,
frescoes, and carvings, shunned the luxurious decoration of the
Byzantine style. Romanesque was Roman; it sought stability and power
rather than Gothic elevation and grace; it aimed to subdue the soul to a
quieting humility rather than lift it to a heaven-storming ecstasy.</p>
<p>Italy produced in this period two masterpieces of Romanesque: the
mod- est church of Sant’ Ambrogio at Milan, and the immense duomo of
Pisa. The building from whose doors Ambrose had barred an emperor was
rebuilt by Benedictines in 789, and again decayed. From 1046 to 1071
Archbishop Guido had it completely remodeled from a colonnaded basilica
into a vaulted church. Nave and aisles, formerly roofed with wood, now
sustained — by round arches springing from compound piers — a vaulted
ceiling of brick and stone. The groins or ridges formed in the vault by
the intersecting ma- sonry arches were reinforced with “ribs” of brick;

<p>The simple front of Sant’ Ambrogio seems all the world apart from the
complex fagade of the cathedral of Pisa, but the elements of style are
the same. After the decisive victory of the Pisan over the Saracen fleet
near Palermo (1063), the city commissioned the architects Buschetto (a
Greek?) and Rinaldo to commemorate the battle, and offer part of the
spoils to the Virgin, by erecting a shrine that should make all Italy
envious. Nearly the entire massive edifice was made of marble. Above the
west portals — later (1606) equipped with superb bronze doors — four
tiers of open arcades spanned the fagade in immoderate iteration.

<li>CHRISTIAN SPAIN: 7H-IO95</li>
</ol>
<p>The history of Christian Spain in this period is that of one long
crusade — the rising resolve to expel the Moors. These were rich and
strong; they held the most fertile terrain, and had the best government;
the Christians were poor and weak, their soil was difficult, their
mountain barriers shut them off from the rest of Europe, divided them
into petty kingdoms, and encouraged provincial chauvinism and fraternal
strife. In this passionate peninsula more Christian blood was shed by
Christians than by Moors.</p>
<p>The Moslem invasion of 7 1 1 drove the unconquered Goths, Suevi,
Chris- tianized Berbers, and Iberian Celts into the Cantabrian Mountains
of north- western Spain. The Moors pursued them, but were defeated at
Covadonga (718) by a small force under the Goth Pelayo, who thereupon
made him- self King of Asturias, and so founded the Spanish monarchy.
The repulse of the Moors at Tours allowed Alfonso I (739-57) to extend
the Asturian frontiers into Galicia, Lusitania, and Viscaya. His
grandson Alfonso II (791 — 842 ) annexed the province of Leon, and made
Oviedo his capital.</p>
<p>In this reign occurred one of the pivotal events of Spanish history.
A shepherd, allegedly guided by a star, found in the mountains a marble
coffin .vhose contents were believed by many to be the remains of the
Apostle James, “brother of the Lord.” A chapel was built on the site,
and later a splendid cathedral; Santiago de Compostela — “St. James of
the Field of the Star”— became a goal of Christian pilgrimage only less
sought than Jerusa- lem and Rome; and the sacred bones proved invaluable
in stirring morale, and raising funds, for the wars against the Moors.
St. James was made the patron saint of Spain, and spread the name
Santiago over three continents. Beliefs make history, especially when
they are wrong; it is for errors that men have most nobly died.</p>
<p>East of Asturias, and just south of the Pyrenees, lay Navarre. Its
inhabitants were mostly of Basque stock — probably of mixed Celtic
Spanish and African Berber blood. Helped by their mountains they
successfully defended their inde- pendence against Moslems, Franks, and
Spaniards; and in 905 Sancho I Garcia founded the kingdom of Navarre,
with Pamplona as his capital. Sancho “the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 459</p>
<p>peacefully incorporating Navarre in the north (1076), it came by 1095
to include a large part of north-central Spain. Catalonia — northeastern
Spain around Barce- lona — was conquered by Charlemagne in 788, and was
ruled by French counts who made the region a semi- independent “Spanish
March”; its language, Catalan, was an interesting compromise between
Provengal French and Castilian. Leon, in the northwest, entered history
with Sancho the Fat, who was so heavy that he could walk only by leaning
upon an attendant. Deposed by the nobles, he went to Cordova, where the
famous Jewish physician and statesman Hasdai ben Shap- rut cured him of
obesity. Now as lithe as Don Quixote, Sancho returned to Leon and
reconquered his throne (959). 14 Castile, in central Spain, was named
from its castles; it fronted Moslem Spain, and lived in continual
readiness for war. In 930 its knights refused any longer to obey the
kings of Asturias or Leon, and set up an independent state, with its
capital at Burgos. Fernando I (1035-65) united Leon and Galicia to
Castile, compelled the emirs of Toledo and Seville to pay him yearly
tribute, and, like Sancho the Great, canceled his labors with his death
by dividing his realm among his three sons, who zealously continued the
tradition of internecine war among the Christian Spanish kings.</p>
<p>Agricultural poverty and political disunity kept Christian Spain far
be- hind its Moslem rival in the south and its Frank rival in the north
in the amenities and arts of civilization. Even within each little
kingdom unity was an interlude; the nobles almost ignored the kings
except in war, and ruled their serfs and slaves in feudal sovereignty.
The ecclesiastical hierarchy formed a second nobility; bishops, too,
owned land, serfs, and slaves, led their own troops in war, usually
ignored the popes, and ruled Spanish Christianity as a well-nigh
independent church. In 1020 at Leon, nobles and bishops joined in
national councils, and legislated as a parliament for the kingdom of
Leon. The Council of Leon granted to that city a charter of
self-government, making it the first autonomous commune in medieval Eu-
rope; similar charters were granted to other Spanish cities, probably to
en- list their ardor and funds in the war against the Moors; and a
limited urban democracy rose amid the feudalism, and under the
monarchies, of Spain.</p>
<p>The career of Rodrigo (Ruy) Diaz illustrates the bravery, chivalry,
and chaos of Christian Spain in the eleventh century. He has come down
to us rather under the title the Moors gave him of El Cid (Arabic say
id) — noble or lord — than under his Christian sobriquet of El Campeador
— the Challenger or Champion. Born at Bivar near Burgos about 1040, he
grew up as a caballero or military adventurer, fighting anywhere for any
paying cause; by the age of thirty he was admired throughout Castile for
his daring skill in combat, and distrusted for his apparently equal
readiness to fight Moors for Christians, or Christians for Moors. Sent
by Alfonso VI of Castile to collect tribute due from al-Mutamid, the
poet emir of Seville, he was accused, on his return, of keeping part of
the tribute, and was banished from Castile (1081). He became a
freebooter, organized a small army of soldiers of for- tune, and sold
his services to Christian or Moslem rulers indifferently. For</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>460</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xeight years he served the emir of Saragossa, and extended the
Moorish do- minion at the expense of Aragon. In 1089, leading 7000 men,
mostly Mos- lems, he captured Valencia, and exacted from it a monthly
tribute of 10,000 gold dinars. In 1090 he seized the count of Barcelona,
and held him for a ransom of 80,000 dinars. Finding Valencia closed to
him on his return from this expedition, he besieged it for a year; when
it surrendered (1094) he violated all the conditions on which it had
laid down its arms, burned its chief justice alive, divided the
possessions of the citizens among his follow- ers, and would have burned
the judge’s wife and daughters too had not the city and his own soldiers
raised a cry of protest. 15 In this and other ways the Cid behaved in
the fashion of his times. He atoned for his sins by gov- erning Valencia
with ability and justice, and making it a saving rampart against the
Almoravid Moors. When he died (1099) his wife Jimena held the city for
three years. An admiring posterity transformed him by legend into a
knight moved only by a holy zeal to restore Spain to Christ; and his
bones at Burgos are revered as those of a saint. 10</p>
<p>So divided against itself, Christian Spain achieved its slow
reconquista only because Moslem Spain finally surpassed it in
fragmentation and anarchy. The fall of the Cordovan caliphate in 1036
offered an opportunity brilliantly used by Alfonso VI of Castile. With
the help of al-Mutamid of Seville he captured Toledo (1085) and made it
his capital. He treated the conquered Moslems with Moslem decency, and
encouraged the absorption of Moor- ish culture into Christian Spain.</p>
<p>hi France: 6 1 4- 1 060</p>
<p>1 . The Coming of the Carolingians: 614-768</p>
<p>When Clotaire II became king of the Franks, the Merovingian dynasty
seemed secure; never before had a monarch of that family ruled so large
and united a realm. But Clotaire was indebted for his rise to the nobles
of Austrasia and Bur- gundy; he rewarded them with increased
independence and enlarged domains, and chose one of them, Pepin I the
Elder, as his “Mayor of the Palace.” The major domns — ’head of the
house”— had been originally the superintendent of the royal household
and overseer of the royal estates; his administrative functions grew as
the Merovingian kings concentrated on debauchery and intrigue; step by
step he took control of the courts, the army, the finances. Clotaire’s
son King Dago - bert (628-39) checked for a time the power of the major
domns and the grandees. “He rendered justice to rich and poor alike,”
says the chronicler Fredegar; “he took little sleep or food, and cared
only so to act that all men should leave his presence full of joy and
admiration”; 17 however, Fredegar adds, “he had three queens and a host
of concubines,” and was “a slave to incontinence.” 18 Under his
negligent successors — the rois faineants or do-nothing kings — power
passed</p>
<p>CHAP.XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 461</p>
<p>again to the mayor of the palace. Pepin II the Younger defeated his
rivals at the battle of Testry (687), expanded his title from major
domus to dux et prlnceps Francorum , and ruled all Gaul except
Aquitaine. His illegitimate son Charles Martel (the Hammer), nominally
as mayor of the palace and Duke of Austrasia, ruled all Gaul under
Clotaire IV (717-19). He resolutely repelled invasions of Gaul by
Frisians and Saxons, and saved Europe for Christianity bv turning back
the Moslems at Tours. He supported Boniface and other missionaries in
the con- version of Germany, but in the critical financial needs of his
career he confiscated church lands, sold bishoprics to generals,
quartered his troops on monasteries, beheaded a protesting monk, 19 and
was condemned to hell in a hundred sermons and tracts.</p>
<p>In 751 his son Pepin III, as ’major domus to Childeric III, sent an
embassy to Pope Zacharias to ask would it be sinful to depose the
Merovingian puppet and make himself king in fact as well as name.
Zacharias, who needed Frank support against the ambitious Lombards,
answered with a comforting negative. Pepin called an assembly of nobles
and prelates at Soissons; he was there unanimously chosen king of the
Franks (751); and the last of the do-nothing kings was ton- sured and
sent to a monastery. In 754 Pope Stephen II came to the abbey of
St. Denis outside of Paris, and anointed Pepin rex Dei gr atia , “king
by the grace of God.” So ended the Merovingian dynasty (486 -751), so
began the Carolingian</p>
<p>( 7 5 i - 98 7 ).</p>
<p>Pepin III “the Short” was a patient and far -seeing ruler, pious and
practical, loving peace and invincible in war, and moral beyond any
royal precedent in the Gaul of those centuries. All that Charlemagne
accomplished was prepared by Pepin; in their two reigns of sixty-three
years (751-814) Gaul was at last trans- formed into France. Pepin
recognized the difficulty of governing without the aid of religion; he
restored the property, privileges, and immunities of the Church; brought
sacred relics to France, and bore them on his shoulders in im- pressive
pageantry; rescued the papacy from the Lombard kings, and gave it a
spaciou s temporal power in the “Donation of Pepin” (756). He was
content to receive in return the title of patricius Romanus&gt; and a
papal injunction to the Franks never to choose a king except from his
progeny. He died in the fullness of his power in 768, after bequeathing
the realm of the Franks jointly to his sons Carloman II and the Charles
who was to be Charlemagne.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Charlemagne: 768-814.</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest of medieval kings was born in 742, at a place unknown.
He was of German blood and speech, and shared some characteristics of
his people — strength of body, courage of spirit, pride of race, and a
crude sim- plicity many centuries apart from the urbane polish of the
modern French. He had little book learning; read only a few books — but
good ones; tried in his old age to learn writing, but never quite
succeeded; yet he could speak old Teutonic and literary Latin, and
understood Greek. 20</p>
<p>In 771 Carloman II died, and Charles at twenty-nine became sole
king.</p>
<p>462 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XTwo years later he received from Pope Hadrian II an urgent appeal
for aid against the Lombard Desiderius, who was invading the papal
states. Charle- magne besieged and took Pavia, assumed the crown of
Lombardy, confirmed the Donation of Pepin, and accepted the role of
protector of the Church in all her temporal powers. Returning to his
capital at Aachen, he began a series of fifty-three campaigns — nearly
all led in person — designed to round out his empire by conquering and
Christianizing Bavaria and Saxony, de- stroying the troublesome Avars,
shielding Italy from the raiding Saracens, and strengthening the
defenses of Francia against the expanding Moors of Spain. The Saxons on
his eastern frontier were pagans; they had burned down a Christian
church, and made occasional incursions into Gaul; these reasons sufficed
Charlemagne for eighteen campaigns (772-804), waged with untiring
ferocity on both sides. Charles gave the conquered Saxons a choice
between baptism and death, and had 4500 Saxon rebels beheaded in one
day; 21 after which he proceeded to Thionville to celebrate the nativity
of Christ.</p>
<p>At Paderborn in 777 Ibn al-Arabi, the Moslem governor of Barcelona,
had asked the aid of the Christian king against the caliph of Cordova.
Charles led an army across the Pyrenees, besieged and captured the
Christian city of Pamplona, treated the Christian but incalculable
Basques of northern Spain as enemies, and advanced even to Saragossa.
But the Moslem uprisings that al-Arabi had promised as part of the
strategy against the caliph failed to appear; Charlemagne saw that his
unaided forces could not challenge Cordova; news came that the conquered
Saxons were in wild revolt and were marching in fury upon Cologne; and
with the better part of valor he led his army back, in long and narrow
file, through the passes of the Pyrenees. In one such pass, at
Roncesvalles in Navarre, a force of Basques pounced down upon the rear
guard of the Franks, and slaughtered nearly every man in it (778) ;
there the noble Hruodland died, who would become three centuries later
the hero of France’s most famous poem, the Chanson de Roland. In 795
Charlemagne sent another army across the Pyrenees; the Spanish March — a
strip of northeast Spain — became part of Francia, Barce- lona
capitulated, and Navarre and Asturias acknowledged the Frankish sov-
ereignty (806) . Meanwhile Charlemagne had subdued the Saxons (785), had
driven back the advancing Slavs (789), had defeated and dispersed the
Avars (790-805), and had, in the thirty-fourth year of his reign and the
sixty-third of his age, resigned himself to peace.</p>
<p>In truth he had always loved administration more than war, and had
taken to the field to force some unity of government and faith upon a
Western Europe torn for centuries past by conflicts of tribe and creed.
He had now brought under his rule all the peoples between the Vistula
and the Atlantic, between the Baltic and the Pyrenees, with nearly all
of Italy and much of the Balkans. How could one man competently govern
so vast and varied a</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 463</p>
<p>realm? He was strong enough in body and nerves to bear a thousand re-
sponsibilities, perils, and crises, even to his sons’ plotting to kill
him. He had in him the blood or teaching of the wise and cautious Pepin
III, and of the ruthless Charles Martel, and was something of a hammer
himself. He ex- tended their power, guarded it with firm military
organization, propped it with religious sanction and ritual. He could
vision large purposes, and could will the means as well as wish the
ends. He could lead an army, persuade an assembly, humor the nobility,
dominate the clergy, rule a harem.</p>
<p>He made military service a condition of owning more than a pittance
of property, and thereby founded martial morale on the defense and
extension of one’s land. Every freeman, at the call to arms, had to
report in full equip - ment to the local count, and every noble was
responsible for the military fitness of his constituents. The structure
of the state rested on this organ- ized force, supported by every
available psychological factor in the sanctity of anointed majesty, the
ceremonial splendor of the imperial presence, and the tradition of
obedience to established rule. Around the king gathered a court of
administrative nobles and clergymen — the seneschal or head of the
palace, the “count palatine” or chief justice, the “palsgraves” or
judges of the palace court, and a hundred scholars, servants, and
clerks. The sense of public participation in the government was
furthered by semiannual as- semblies of armed property owners, gathered,
as military or other conven- ience might dictate, at Worms,
Valenciennes, Aachen, Geneva, Paderborn . . . usually in the open air.
At such assemblies the king submitted to smaller groups of nobles or
bishops his proposals for legislation; they considered them, and
returned them to him with suggestions; he formulated the capitula , or
chapters of legislation, and presented these to the multitude for their
shouted approval; rarely the assembly voiced disapproval with a
collective grunt or moan. Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims, has transmitted
an intimate picture of Charles at one of these gatherings, “saluting the
men of most note, conversing with those whom he seldom saw, showing a
tender interest to- ward the elders, and disporting himself with the
young.” At these meetings each provincial bishop and administrator was
required to report to the King any significant event in his locality
since the pr evious convocation. “The King wished to know,” says
Hincmar, “whether in any part or corner of the Kingdom the people were
restless, and the cause thereof .” 22 Sometimes (continuing the old
Roman institution of inquisitio ) the representatives of the King would
summon leading citizens to inquire and give under oath a “true
statement” (veredictum) as to the taxable wealth, the state of public
order, the existence of crimes or criminals, in the district visited. In
the nin th century, in Frank lands, this verdict of a jurata, or sworn
group of inquir- ers, was used to decide many local issues of land
ownership or criminal guilt. Out of the jurata , through Norman and
English developments, would come the jury system of modern times .

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>XThe empire was divided into counties, each governed in spiritual
matters by a bishop or archbishop, and in secular affairs by a comes
(companion — of the king) or count. A local assembly of landholders
convened twice or thrice a year in each provincial capital to pass upon
the government of the region, and serve as a provincial court of
appeals. The dangerous frontier counties, or marches, had special
governors — graf, margrave , or markherzog ; Roland of Roncesvalles, for
example, was governor of the Breton march. All local administration was
subject to rnissi dominici — “emissaries of the master” — sent by
Charlemagne to convey his wishes to local officials, to review their
actions, judgments, and accounts,’ to check bribery, extortion,
nepotism, and exploitation, to receive complaints and remedy wrongs, to
protect “the</p>
<p>The sixty- five capitularies that remain of Charlemagne’s legislation
are among the most interesting bodies of medieval law. They were not an
organ- ized system, but rat her the extension and application of
previous “barbarian” codes to new occasion or need. In some particulars
they were less enlight- ened than the laws of King Liutprand of
Lombardy: they kept the old wer- gild, ordeals, trial by combat, and
punishment by mutilation ; 24 and decreed death for relapse into
paganism, or for eating meat in Lent — though here the priest was
allowed to soften the penalty . 25 Nor were all these capitular- ies
laws; some were answers to inquiries, some were questions addressed by
Charlemagne to officials, some were moral counsels. “It is necessary,”
said one article, “that every man should seek to the best of his
strength and ability to serve God and walk in the way of His precepts;
for the Lord Em- peror cannot watch ove r every man in personal
discipline .” 20 Several articles struggled to bring more order into the
sexual and marital relations of the people. Not all these counsels were
obeyed; but there runs through the capitularies a conscientious effort
to transform barbarism into civilization.</p>
<p>Charlemagne legislated for agriculture, industry, finance, education,
and religion as well as for government and morals. His reign fell into a
period when the economy of southern France and Italy was at low ebb
through the control of the Mediterranean by the Saracens. “The
Christians,” said Ibn Khaldun, “could no longer float a plank upon the
sea .” 27 The whole structure of commercial relations between Western
Europe and Africa and</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 465</p>
<p>the Levant was disturbed; only the Jews — whom Charlemagne sedulously
protected for this reason — connected the now hostile halves of what
under Rome had been a united economic world. Commerce survived in Slavic
and Byzantine Europe, and in the Teutonic north. The English Channel and
the North Sea were alive with trade; but this too would be disordered,
even before Charlemagne’s death, by Norse piracy and raids. Vikings on
the north and Moslems on the south almost closed the ports of France,
and made her an inland and agricultural state. The mercantile middle
class declined, leaving no group to compete with the rural aristocracy;
French feudalism was promoted by Charlemagne’s land grants and by the
triumphs of Islam.</p>
<p>Charlemagne struggled to protect a free peasantry against spreading
serf- dom, but the power of the nobles, and the force of circumstance,
frustrated him. Even slavery grew for a time, as a result of the
Carolingian wars against pagan tribes. The King’s own estates,
periodically extended by confiscations, gifts, intestate reversions, and
reclamation, were the chief source of the royal revenue. For the care of
these lands he issued a Capitulare de villis astonishingly detailed, and
revealing his careful scrutiny of all state income and expense. Forests,
wastelands, highways, ports, and all mineral subsoil resources were the
property of the state. 28 Every encouragement was given to such commerce
as survived; the fairs were protected, weights and meas- ures and prices
were regulated, tolls were moderated, speculation in futures was
checked, roads and bridges were built or repaired, a great span was
thrown across the Rhine at Mainz, waterways were kept open, and a canal
was planned to connect the Rhine and the Danube, and thereby the North
with the Black Sea. A stable currency was maintained; but the scarcity
of gold in France and the decline of trade led to the replacement of
Constan- tine’s gold solidus with the silver pound.</p>
<p>The energy and solicitude of the King reached into every sphere of
life. He gave to the four winds the names they bear today. He
established a sys- tem of poor relief, taxed the nobles and the clergy
to pay its costs, and then made mendicancy a crime. 29 Appalled by the
illiteracy of his time, when hardly any but ecclesiastics could read,
and by the lack of education among the lower clergy, he called in
foreign scholars to restore the schools of France. Paul the Deacon was
lured from Monte Cassino, and Alcuin from York (782), to teach the
school that Charlemagne organized in the royal palace at Aachen. Alcuin
(735-804) was a Saxon, born near York, and edu- cated in the cathedral
school that Bishop Egbert had founded there; in the eighth century
Britain and Ireland were culturally ahead of France. When King Offa of
Mercia sent Alcuin on a mission to Charlemagne, the latter begged the
scholar to remain; Alcuin, glad to be out of England when the Danes were
“laying it desolate, and dishonoring the monasteries with adul - tery,”
30 consented to stay. He sent to England and elsewhere for books and
teachers, and soon the palace school was an active center of study, of
the</p>
<p>466 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xrevision and copying of manuscripts, and of an educational reform
that spread throughout the realm. Among the pupils were Charlemagne, his
wife Liutgard, his sons, his daughter Gisela, his secretary Eginhard, a
nun, and many more. Charlemagne was the most eager of all; he seized
upon learning as he had absorbed states; he studied rhetoric, dialectic,
astronomy; he made heroic efforts to write, says Eginhard, “and used to
keep tablets under his pillow in order that at leisure hours he might
accustom his hand to form the letters; but as he began these efforts so
late in life, they met with ill suc- cess.” 31 He studied Latin
furiously, but continued to speak German at his court; he compiled a
German grammar, and collected specimens of early German poetry.</p>
<p>When Alcuin, after eight years in the palace school, pled for a less
ex- citing environment, Charlemagne reluctantly made him Abbot of Tours
(796). There Alcuin spurred the monks to make fairer and more accurate
copies of the Vulgate of Jerome, the Latin Fathers, and the Latin
classics; and other monasteries imitated the example. Many of our best
classical texts have come down to us from these monastic scriptoria of
the ninth century; practically all extant Latin poetry except Catullus,
Tibullus, and Propertius, and nearly all extant Latin prose except
Varro, Tacitus, and Apuleius, were preserved for us by the monks of the
Carolingian age. 32 Many of the Caro- line manuscripts were handsomely
illuminated by the patient art of the monks; to this “Palace School” of
illumination belonged the “Vienna” Gos - pels on which the later German
emperors took their coronation oath.</p>
<p>In 787 Charlemagne issued to all the bishops and abbots of Francia an
historic Capitulare de litteris colendis, or directive on the study of
letters. It reproached ecclesiastics for “uncouth language” and
“unlettered tongues,” and exhorted every cathedral and monastery to
establish schools where clergy and laity alike might learn to read and
write. A further capitulary of 789 urged the directors of these schools
to “take care to make no differ - ence between the sons of serfs and of
freemen, so that they might come and sit on the same benches to study
grammar, music, and arithmetic.” A capit - ulary of 805 provided for
medical education, and another condemned med- ical superstitions. That
his appeals were not fruitless appears from the many cathedral or
monastic schools that now sprang up in France and western Germany.
Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans, organized schools in every parish of his
diocese, welcomed all children to them, and forbade the priest instruc-
tors to take any fees; 33 this is the first instance in history of free
and general education. Important schools, nearly all attached to
monasteries, rose in the ninth century at Tours, Auxerre, Pavia,
St. Gall, Fulda, Ghent, and else- where. To meet the demand for teachers
Charlemagne imported scholars from Ireland, Britain, and Italy. Out of
these schools were to come the uni- versities of Europe.</p>
<p>We must not overestimate the intellectual quality of the age; this

<p>lastic resurrection was the awakening of children rather than the
maturity of such cultures as then existed in Constantinople, Baghdad,
and Cordova. It did not produce any great writers. The formal
compositions of Alcuin are stiflingly dull; only his letters and
occasional verses show him as no pom- pous pedant but a kindly soul who
could reconcile happiness with piety. Many men wrote poetry in this
short-lived renaissance, and the poems of Theodulf are pleasant enough
in their minor way. But the only lasting com- position of that Gallic
age was the brief and simple biography of Charle- magne by Eginhard. It
follows the plan of Suetonius’ Lives of the Caesars, and even snatches
passages therefrom to apply to Charlemagne; but all is forgiven to an
author who modestly describes himself as “a barbarian, very little
versed in the Roman tongue .” 34 He must have been a man of talent
nevertheless, for Charlemagne made him royal steward and treasurer and
intimate friend, and chose him to supervise, perhaps to design, much of
the architecture of this creative reign.</p>
<p>Palaces were built for the Emperor at Ingelheim and Nijmegen; and at
Aachen, his favorite capital, he raised the famous palace and chapel
that survived a thousand dangers to crumble under the shells and bombs
of the Second World War. The unknown architects modeled its plan on the
church of San Vitale at Ravenna, which owed its form to Byzantine and
Syrian exemplars; the result was an Oriental cathedral stranded in the
West. The octagonal structure was surmounted by a circular dome; the
interior was divided by a circular two- storied colonnade, and was
“adorned with gold and silver and lamps, railings and doors of solid
bronze, columns and crucibles brought fro m Rome and Ravenna,” 35 and a
famous mosaic in the dome.</p>
<p>Charlemagne was profusely generous to the Church; at the same time he
made himself her master, and used her doctrines and personnel as
instruments of education and government. Much of his correspondence was
about re- ligion; he hurled scriptural quotations at corrupt officials
or worldly clerics; and the intensity of his utterance forbids suspicion
that his piety was a po- litical pose. He sent money to distressed
Christians in foreign lands, and in his negotiations with Moslem rulers
he insisted on fair treatment of their Christian population . 36 Bishops
played a leading part in his councils, assem- blies, and administration;
but he looked upon them, however reverently, as his agents under God;
and he did not hesitate to command them, even in matters of doctrine or
morals. He denounced image worship while the popes were defending it;
required from every priest a written description of how baptism was
administered in his parish, sent the popes directives as numer- ous as
his gifts, suppressed insubordination in monasteries, and ordered a
strict watch on convents to prevent “whoring, drunkenness, and covetous
- ness” among the nuns . 37 In a capitulary of 8 1 1 he asked the clergy
what t hey meant by professing to renounce the world, when “we see” some
of them</p>

possessions; now making use, for this purpose, of menaces of eternal
flames, now of promises of eternal beatitude; despoiling simple-minded
people of their prop- erty in the name of God or some saint, to the
infinite prejudice of their law- ful heirs.” Nevertheless he allowed the
clergy their own courts, decreed</p>
<p>Out of this intimate co-operation of Church and state came one of the
most brilliant ideas in the history of statesmanship: the transformation
of Charlemagne’s realm into a Holy Roman Empi re that should have behind
it all the prestige, sanctity, and stability of both Imperial and papal
Rome. The popes had long resented their territorial subordination to a
Byzantium that gave them no protection and no security; they saw the
increasing sub- jection of the patriarch to the emperor at
Constantinople, and feared for their own freedom. We do not know who
conceived or arranged the plan of a papal coronation of Charlemagne as
Roman emperor; Alcuin, Theodulf, and others close to him had discussed
its possibility; perhaps the initiative lay with them, perhaps with the
councilors of the popes. There were great difficulties in the way: the
Greek monarch already had the title of Roman emperor, and full historic
right to that title; the Church had no recognized authority to convey or
transfer the title; to give it to a rival of Byzantium might precipitate
a gigantic war of Christian East against Christian West, leaving a
ruined Europe to a conquering Islam. It was of some help that Irene had
seized the Greek throne (797); now, some said, there was no Greek
emperor, and the field was open to any claimant. If the bold scheme
could be carried through there would again be a Roman emperor in the
West, Latin Christianity would stand strong and unified against
schismatic Byzan- tium and threatening Saracens, and, by the awe and
magic of the imperial name, barbarized Europe might reach back across
centuries of darkness, and inherit and Christianize the civilization and
culture of the ancient world.</p>
<p>On December 26, 795, Leo III was chosen Pope. The Roman populace did
not like him; it accused him of various misdeeds; and on April 25, 799,
it attacked him, maltreated him, and imprisoned him in a monastery. He
escaped, and fled for protection to Charlemagne at Paderborn. The King
received him kindly, and sent him back to Rome under armed escort, and
ordered the Pope and his accusers to appear before him there in the
follow- ing year. On November 24, 800, Charlemagne entered the ancient
capital in state; on December 1 an assembly of Franks and Romans agreed
to drop the charges against Leo if he would deny them on solemn oath; he
did; and the way was cleared for a magnificent celebration of the
Nativity. On</p>
<p>CHAP.XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 469</p>
<p>Christmas Day, as Charlemagne, in the chlamys and sandals of a
patricius Romanus , knelt before St. Peter’s altar in prayer, Leo
suddenly produced a jeweled crown, and set it upon the King’s head. The
congregation, per - haps instructed beforehand to act according to
ancient ritual as the senatus populusque Romanus confirming a
coronation, thrice cried out: “Hail to Charles the Augustus, crowned by
God the great and peace-bringing Em- peror of the Romans!” The royal
head was anointed with holy oi l, the Pope saluted Charlemagne as
Emperor and Augustus, and offered him the act of homage reserved since
476 for the Eastern emperor.</p>
<p>If we may believe Eginhard, Charlemagne told him that had he known
Leo’s intention to crown him he would not have en tered the church. Per-
haps he had learned of the general plan, but regretted the haste and
circum- stances of its execution; it may not have pleased him to receive
the crown from a pope, opening the door to centuries of dispute as to
the relative dig- nity and power of donor and recipient; and presumably
he anticipated dif- ficulties with Byzantium. He now sent frequent
embassies and letters to Constantinople, seeking to heal the breach; and
for a long time he made no use of his new title. In 802 he offered
marriage to Irene as a means of mutu- ally legitimizing their dubious
titles; 39 but Irene’s fall from power shattered</p>
<p>The coronation had results for a thousand years. It strengthened the
papacy and the bishops by making civil authority derive from
ecclesiastical conferment; Gregory VII and Innocent III would build a
mightier Church on the events of 800 in Rome. It strengthened
Charlemagne against baronial and other disaffection by making him a very
vicar of God; it vastly advanced the theory of the divine right of
kings. It contributed to the schism of Greek from Latin Christianity;
the Greek Church did not relish subordination to a Roman Church allied
with an empire rival to Byzantium. The fact that Charlemagne (as the
Pope desired) continued to make Aachen, not Rome, his capital,
underlined the passage of political power from the Mediterranean to
northern Europe, from the Latin peoples to the Teutons. Above all, the
coronation established the Holy Roman Empire in fact, though not in the-
ory. Charlemagne and his advisers conceived of his new authority as a
re- vival of the old imperial power; only with Otto I was the
distinctively new character of the regime recognized; and it became
“holy” only when Fred - erick Barbarossa introduced the word sacrum into
his title in 1155. All in all, despite its threat to the liberty of the
mind and the citizen, the Holy</p>
<p>470 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XRoman Empire was a noble conception, a dream of security and peace,
order and civilization restored in a world heroically won from
barbarism, violence, and ignorance.</p>
<p>Imperial formalities now hedged in the Emperor on occasions of state.
Then he had to wear embroidered robes, a golden buckle, jeweled shoes,
and a crown of gold and gems, and visitors prostrated themselves to kiss
his foot or knee; so much had Charlemagne learned from Byzantium, and
By- zantium from Ctesiphon. But in other days, Eginhard assures us, his
dress varied little from the common garb of the Franks — linen shirt and
breeches next to the skin, and over these a woolen tunic perhaps fringed
with silk; hose fastened by bands covered his legs, leather shoes his
feet; in winter he added a close-fitting coat of otter or marten skins;
and always a sword at his side. He was six feet four inches tall, and
built to scale. He had blond hair, animated eyes, a powerful nose, a
mustache but no beard, a presence “always stately and dignified .” 40 He
was temperate in eating and drinking, abominated drunkenness, and kept
in good health despite every exposure and hardship. He often hunted, or
took vigorous exercise on horseback. He was a good swimmer, and liked to
bathe in the warm springs of Aachen. He rarely entertained, preferring
to hear music or the reading of a book while he ate. Like every great
man he valued time; he gave audiences and heard cases in the morning
while dressing and putting on his shoes.</p>
<p>Behind his poise and majesty were passion and energy, but harnessed
to his aims by a clairvoyant intelligence. His vital force was not
consumed by half a hundred campaigns; he gave himself also, with never
aging enthusi- asm, to science, law, literature, and theology; he
fretted at leaving any part of the earth, or any section of knowledge,
unmastered or unexplored. In some ways he was mentally ingenuous; he
scorned superstition and pro- scribed diviners and soothsayers, but he
accepted many mythical marvels, and exaggerated the power of legislation
to induce goodness or intelligence. This simplicity of soul had its fair
side: there was in his thought and speech a directness and honesty
seldom permitted to statesmanship.</p>
<p>He could be ruthless when policy required, and was especially cruel
in his efforts to spread Christianity. Yet he was a man of great
kindness, many charities, warm friendships, and varied loves. He wept at
the death of his sons, his daughter, and Pope Hadrian. In a poem Ad
Carolum regem Theo- dulf draws a pleasant picture of the Emperor at
home. On his arrival from labors his children gather about him; son
Charles takes off the father’s cloak, son Louis his sword; his six
daughters embrace him, bring him bread, wine, apples, flowers; the
bishop comes in to bless the King’s food; Alcuin is near to discuss
letters with him; the diminutive Eginhard runs to and fro like an ant,
bringing in enormous books . 41 He was so fond of his daughters that he
dissuaded them from marriage, saying that he could not bear to be
without them. They consoled themselves with unlicensed amours, and bore
several</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 47 1</p>
<p>illegitimate children. 42 Charlemagne accepted these accidents with
good humor, since he himself, following the custom of his predecessors,
had four successive wives and five mistresses or concubines. His
abounding vitality made him extremely sensitive to feminine charms; and
his women preferred a share in him to the monopoly of any other man. His
harem bore him some eighteen children, of whom eight were legitimate. 43
The ecclesiastics of the court and of Rome winked leniently at the
Moslem morals of so Christian a king.</p>
<p>He was now head of an empire far greater than the Byzantine,
surpassed, in the white man’s world, only by the realm of the Abbasid
caliphate. But every extended frontier of empire or knowledge opens up
new problems. Western Europe had tried to protect itself from the
Germans by taking them into its civilization; but now Germany had to be
protected against the Norse and the Slavs. The Vikings had by 800
established a kingdom in Jut- land, and were raiding the Frisian coast.
Charles hastened up from Rome, built fleets and forts on shores and
rivers, and stationed garrisons at danger points. In 810 the king of
Jutland invaded Frisia and was repulsed; but shortly thereafter, if we
may follow the chronicle of the Monk of St. Gall, Charlemagne, from his
palace at Narbonne, was shocked to see Danish pirate vessels in the Gulf
of Lyons.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he foresaw, like Diocletian, that his overreaching
empire needed quick defense at many points at once, he divided it in 806
among his three sons — Pepin, Louis, and Charles. But Pepin died in 8
10, Charles in 8 1 1 ; only Louis remained, so absorbed in piety as to
seem unfit to govern a rough and treacherous world. Nevertheless, in
813, at a solemn ceremony, Louis was elevated from the rank of king to
that of emperor, and the old monarch uttered his mine dimittis :
“Blessed be Thou, O Lord God, Who hast granted me the grace to see’ with
my own eyes my son seated on my throne !” 44 Four months later,
wintering at Aachen, he was seized with a high fever, and de- veloped
pleurisy. He tried to cure himself by taking only liquids; but after an
illness of seven days he died, in the forty-seventh year of his reign
and the seventy-second year of his life (814). He was buried under the
dome of the cathedral at Aachen, dressed in his imperial robes. Soon all
the world called him Carolus Magnus, Karl der Grosse, Charlemagne; and
in 1165, when time had washed away all memory of his mistresses, the
Church which he had served so well enrolled him among the blessed.</p>
<p>3 . The Carolingian Decline</p>
<p>The Carolingian renaissance was one of several heroic interludes in
the Dark Ages. It might have ended the darkness three centuries before
Abelard had it not been for the quarrels and incompetence of
Charlemagne’s succes -</p>
<p>47 2 the age of faith (chap. XI</p>
<p>Xsors, the feudal anarchy of the barons, the disruptive struggle
between Church and state, and the Norman, Magyar, and Saracen invasions
invited by these ineptitudes. One man, one lifetime, had not availed to
establish a new civilization. The short-lived revival was too narrowly
clerical; the com- mon citizen had no part in it; few of the nobles
cared a fig for it, few of them even bothered to learn how to read.
Charles himself must bear some blame for the collapse of his empire. He
had so enriched the clergy that the power of the bishops, now that his
strong hand was lifted, outweighed that of the emperor; and he had been
compelled, for military and administrative reasons, to yield a dangerous
degree of independence to the courts and barons in the provinces. He had
left the finances of an imperially burdened government dependent upon
the loyalty and integrity of these rude aristo- crats, and upon the
modest income of his own lands and mines. He had not been able, like the
Byzantine emperors, to build up a bureaucracy of civil servants
responsible only to the central power, or capable of carrying on the
government through all vicissitudes of imperial personnel. Within a
generation after his death the missi dominici, who had spread his
authority through the counties, were disbanded or ignored, and the local
lords slipped out of central control. Charlemagne’s reign was a fea t of
genius; it repre- sented political advancement in an age and region of
economic decline.</p>
<p>The cognomens given to his successors by their contemporaries tell
the story: Louis the Pious, Charles the Bald, Louis the Stammerer,
Charles the Fat, Charle s the Simple. Louis the “Pious”* (814 -40) was
as tall and hand- some as his father; modest, gentle, and gracious, and
as incorrigibly lenient as Caesar. Brought up by priests, he took to
heart the moral precepts that Charlemagne had practiced with such
moderation. He had one wife, and no concubines; he expelled from the
court his father’s mistresses and his sisters’ paramours, and when the
sisters protested, he immured them in nunneries. He took the priests at
their word, and bade the monks live up to their Bene- dictine rule.
Wherever he found injustice or exploitation he tried to stop it, and to
right what wrong had been done. The people marveled to find him always
taking the side of the weak or poor.</p>
<p>Feeling bound by Frank custom, he divided his empire into kingdoms
ruled by his sons — Pepin, Lothaire, and Louis “the German” (whom we
shall call Ludwig). By his second wife, Judith, Louis had a fourth son,
known to history as Charles the Bald; Louis loved him with almost
grandparental infatuation, and wished to give him a share of the empire,
annulling the divi- sion of 817; the three older sons objected, and
began eight years of civil war against their father. The majority of the
nobles and the clergy supported the rebellion; the few who seemed loyal
deserted Louis in a crisis at Roth- feld (near Colmar), which thereafter
was known as the Liigenfeld, the Field</p>

faithful, kind, gentle, and much besides.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 473</p>
<p>of Lies. Louis bade his remaining supporters leave him for their own
pro- tection, and surrendered to his sons (833). They jailed and
tonsured Judith, confined young Charles in a convent, and ordered their
father to abdicate and do public penance. In a church at Soissons Louis,
surrounded by thirty bishops, and in the presence of his son and
successor Lothaire, was compelled to bare himself to the waist,
prostrate himself upon a haircloth, and read aloud a confession of
crime. He took the gray garb of a penitent, and for a year was
imprisoned in a monastery. From this moment a united episco- pate ruled
France amid the disintegration of the Carolingian house.</p>
<p>Popular sentiment revolted against Lothaire’s treatment of Louis.
Many nobles and some prelates responded to the appeals of Judith to
annul the deposition; a quarrel among the sons ensued; Pepin and Ludwig
released their father, restored him to his throne, and returned Judith
and Charles to his arms (834). Louis took no revenge, but forgave all.
When Pepin died (838) a new partition was made; Ludwig did not like it,
and invaded Saxony. The old Emperor again took the field, and repelled
the invasion; but he fell ill of exposure on the way back, and died near
Ingelheim (840). Among his last words were a message of forgiveness to
Ludwig, and an appeal to Lo- thaire, now Emperor, to protect Judith and
Charles.</p>
<p>Lothaire tried to reduce Charles and Ludwig to the rank of vassals;
they defeated him at Fonteney (841), and took at Strasbourg an oath of
mutual loyalty famous as our oldest document in French. In 843, however,
they signed with Lothaire the Treaty of Verdun, and partitioned the
empire of Charlemagne into approximately the modern states of Italy,
Germany, and France. Ludwig received the lands between the Rhine and the
Elbe, Charles received most of France and the Spanish March. Lothaire
received Italy, and the lands between the Rhine on the east and the
Scheldt, Saone, and Rhone on the west; this heterogeneous terrain,
stretching from Holland to Pro- vence, took his name as Lothari regvum ,
Lotharingia, Lothringar, Lorraine. It had no ethnic or linguistic unity,
and inevitably became the battleground between Germany and France,
repeatedly changing masters in the bloody fluctuations of victory and
defeat.</p>
<p>During these costly civil wars, weakening the government, man power,
wealth, and morale of Western Europe, the expanding tribes of
Scandinavia invaded France in a barbarian wave that resumed and
completed the havoc and terror of the German migrations of four
centuries before. While the Swedes were infiltrating Russia, and the
Norwegians were getting a foothold in Ireland, and the Danes were
conquering England, a mixture of Scandi- navians whom we may call Norse
or Northmen raided the coastal and river cities of France. After the
death of Louis the Pious these raids became great expeditions, with
fleets of over a hundred vessels fully manned with oarsmen- warriors. In
the ninth and tenth centuries France endured forty-seven Norse attacks.
In 840 the raiders sacked Rouen, beginning a century of assaults</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>474</p>
<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>Xupon Normandy; in 843 they entered Nantes and slew the bishop at his
altar; in 844 they sailed up the Garonne to Toulouse; in 845 they
mounted the Seine to Paris, but spared the city on receiving a tribute
of 7000 pounds of silver. In 846 — while the Saracens were attacking
Rome — the Northmen con- quered Frisia, burned Dordrecht, and sacked
Limoges. In 847 they besieged Bordeaux, but were repulsed; in 848 they
tried again, captured it, plundered it, massacred its population, and
burned it to the ground. In the following years they dealt a like fate
to Beauvais, Bayeux, St.-Lo, Meaux, fivreux, Tours; we may surmise
something of the terror by noting that Tours was pillaged in 853, 85 6,
862, 872, 886, 903, and 919. 45 Paris was pillaged in 856, again in 861,
and burned in 865. At Orleans and Chartres the bishops organ- ized
armies and drove back the invaders (855); but in 856 Danish pirates
sacked Orleans. In 859 a Norse fleet sailed through Gibraltar into the
Medi- terranean; raided towns along the Rhone as far north as Valence;
crossed the Gulf of Genoa, and plundered Pisa and other Italian cities.
Baffled here and there by the fortified castles of the nobles, the
invaders rifled or de- stroyed the treasures of the unprotected churches
and monasteries, often burning them and their libraries, and sometimes
killing the priests and monks. In the litanies of those dark days men
prayed, Libera nos a jurore Normano- rum — “Deliver us from the Norse
fury!” 46 As if in a conspiracy with the Northmen, the Saracens took
Corsica and Sardinia in 810, ravaged the French Riviera in 820, sacked
Arles in 842, and held most of the French Mediterranean coast till
972.</p>
<p>What were the kings and barons doing in all this half century of
destruc- tion? The barons, themselves harassed, were loath to go to the
aid of other regions, and responded weakly to appeals for united action.
The kings were busy with their wars for territory or the Imperial
throne, and sometimes en- couraged the Norse to raid a rival’s shores.
In 859 Archbishop Hincmar of Reims directly accused Charles the Bald of
negligence in the defense of France. Charles was succeeded (877-88) by
worse weaklings — Louis II the Stammerer, Louis III, Carloman, and
Charles the Fat. By the accidents of time and death all the realm of
Charlemagne was again united under Charles the Fat, and the dying empire
had another chance to fight for its life. But in 880 the Norse captured
and burned Nijmegen, and turned Courtrai and Ghent into Norman
strongholds; in 88 1 they burned Liege, Cologne, Bonn, Priim, and
Aachen; in 882 they captured Trier, killing the archbishop who led its
defense; in the same year they took Reims, forcing Hincmar to flight and
death. In 883 they seized Amiens, but retired on receiving 1 2,000
pounds of silver from King Carloman. In 885 they took Rouen, and sailed
up to Paris in 700 ships with 30,000 men. The governor of the city,
Count Odo or Eudes, and its Bishop Gozlin led a valiant resistance; for
thirteen months Paris stood siege, and made a dozen sorties; finally
Charles the Fat, instead of coming to the rescue, paid the Northmen 700
pounds of silver, and gave them</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 475</p>
<p>permission to go up the Seine and winter in Burgundy, which they
pillaged to their hearts’ content. Charles was deposed, and died in 888.
Odo was chosen king of France, and Paris, its strategic value now
proved, became the seat of government.</p>
<p>Odo’s successor, Charles the Simple (898 -923), protected the region
of the Seine and the Saone, but raised no hand against Norse
depredations in the rest of France. In 911 he conceded to Rolf or Rollo,
a Norman chieftain, the districts of Rouen, Lisieux, and Lvreux, which
the Normans already held; they consented to do feudal homage for them to
the king, but laughed in his face as they performed the ceremony. Rollo
agreed to baptism; his people followed him to the font, and slowly
subsided into agriculture and civilization. So Normandy began, as a
Norse conquest in France.</p>
<p>The simple king had found a solution for Paris at least; now the
Normans themselves would block invaders entering the Seine. But
elsewhere the Norse raids continued. Chartres was pillaged in 91 1,
Angers in 919; Aquitaine and Auvergne were plundered in 923; Artois and
the Beauvais region in 924. Almost at the same time the Magyars, having
ravaged southern Germany, entered Burgundy in 917, crossed and recrossed
the French frontier unhin- dered, robbed and burned the monasteries near
Reims and Sens (937), passed like consuming locusts through Aquitaine
(951), burned the suburbs of Cambrai, Laon, and Reims (954), and
leisurely looted Burgundy. Under these repeated blows of Norse and Hun
the fabric of social order in France verged upon total collapse. Cried
an ecclesiastical synod at Trosle in 909:</p>
<p>The cities are depopulated, the monasteries ruined and burned, the
country reduced to solitude. … As the first men lived without law</p>
<p>… so now every man does what seems good in his own eyes,
despising</p>
<p>laws human and divine The strong oppress the weak; the world is</p>
<p>full of violence against the poor, and of the plunder of
ecclesiastical goods. . . . Men devour one another like the fishes in
the sea. 47</p>
<p>The last Carolingian kings — Louis IV, Lothaire IV, Louis V — were
well- meaning men, but they had not in their blood the iron needed to
forge a liv- ing order out of the universal desolation. When Louis V
died without issue (987), the nobles and prelates of France sought
leadership in some other line than the Carolingian. They found it in the
descendants of a marquess of Neustria significantly named Robert the
Strong (d. 866) . The Odo who had saved Paris was his son; a grandson,
Hugh the Great (d. 956), had acquired by purchase or war almost all the
region between Normandy, the Seine, and the Loire as his feudal realm,
and had wielded more wealth and power than the kings. Now Hugh’s son,
called Hugh Capet, had inherited this wealth and power, and apparently
the ability that had won them. Archbishop Adal- bero, guided by the
subtle scholar Gerbert, proposed Hugh Capet as king of France. He was
unanimously elected (987), and that Capetian dynasty</p>
<p>47 6 the age of faith (chap. XI</p>
<p>Xbegan which, in direct or collateral line, would rule France until
the Revo- lution.</p>

<p>Perhaps we exaggerate the damage done by the Norse and Magyar raids;
to crowd them into a page for brevity’s sake darkens unduly the picture
of a life in which there were doubtless intervals of security and peace.
Monas- teries continued to be built throughout this terrible ninth
century, and were often the centers of busy industry. Rouen, despite
raids and fires, grew stronger from trade with Britain; Cologne and
Mainz dominated commerce on the Rhine; and in Flanders thriving centers
of industry and trade devel- oped at Ghent, Ypres, Lille, Douai, Arras,
Tournai, Dinant, Cambrai, Liege, and Valenciennes.</p>
<p>The monastic libraries suffered tragic losses of classic treasures
during the raids, and doubtless many churches were then destroyed which
had opened schools on the lines of Charlemag ne’s decree. Libraries
survived at the mon - asteries or churches of Fulda, Lorsch, Reichenau,
Mainz, Trier, Cologne, Liege, Laon, Reims, Corbie, Fleury, St. Denis,
Tours, Bobbio, Monte Cas-</p>
<p>sino, St. Gall The Benedictine monastery at St. Gall was acclaimed
for its</p>
<p>writers as well as for its school and its books. Here Notker Balbulus
— the Stammerer — (840-912) wrote excellent hymns and the Chronicle of
the Monk of St. Gall, here Notker Labeo — the Thick-lipped — (950-1022)
trans- lated Boethius, Aristotle, and other classics into German; these
translations, among the first productions of German prose, helped to fix
the forms and syntax of the new tongue.</p>
<p>Even in harassed France the monastic schools were lighting up these
Dark Ages. Remy of Auxerre opened a public school at Paris in 900; and
in the tenth century schools were established at Auxerre, Corbie, Reims,
and Liege. At Chartres, about 1006, Bishop Fulbert (960-1028) founded a
school that became the most renowned in France before Abelard; there the
venera- bilis Socrates, as his pupils called him, organized the teaching
of science, medicine, and classical literature as well as theology,
Scripture, and liturgy. Fulbert was a man of noble devotion, saintly
patience, and endless charity. To his school, before the end of the
eleventh century, would come such scholars as John of Salisbury, William
of Conches, Berengar of Tours, and Gilbert de la Porree. Meanwhile, now
at Compiegne, now at Laon, the Palace School established by Charlemagne
reached the height of its glory under the encouragement and protection
of Charles the Bald.</p>
<p>To this Palace School, in 845, Charles invited divers Irish and
English scholars. Among them was one of the most original and audacious
minds of the Middle Ages, a man whose existence casts doubt upon the
advisability of retaining the phrase “Dark Ages” even for the ninth
century. His name</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 477</p>
<p>doubly revealed his origin. Johannes Scotus Eriugena — “John the
Irishman, bor n in Erin”; we shall call him simply Erigena. Though
apparently not an ecclesiastic, he was a man of wide learning, a master
of Greek, a lover of Plato and the classics, and something of a wit. A
story that has all the ear- marks of literary invention tells how
Charles the Bald, dining with him, asked him Quid distat inter sottum et
Scotum — 1 What distinguishes” (literally, what separates) “a fool from
an Irishman?”— to which John is said to have answered, “The table.” 48
Nevertheless Charles was fon d of him, attended his lectures, and
probably enjoyed his heresies. John’s book on the Eucharist interpreted
the sacrament as symbolical, and by implication questioned the Real
Presence of Christ in the consecrated bread or wine. When Gottschalk, a
German monk, preached absolute predestinarianism, and therefore denied
free will in man, Archbishop Hincmar asked Erigena to write a reply. The
resultant treatise De divina praedestinatione (c. 85 1 ) began with a
startling exaltation of philosophy: “In ea rnestly investigating and
attempting to dis- cover the reason of all things, every means of
attaining to a pious and perfect doctrine lies in that science and
discipline which the Greeks call philosophy.” In effect the book denied
predestination; the will is free in both God and man; God does not know
evil, for if He knew it, He would be the cause of it. The answer was
more heretical than Gottschalk’s, and was condemned by two church
councils in 855 and 859. Gottschalk was confined in a mon- astery till
his death, but the King protected Erigena.</p>
<p>In 824 the Byzantine Emperor Michael the Stammerer had sent to Louis
the Pious the Greek manuscript of a book, The Celestial Hierarchy ,
believed by Christian orthodoxy to have been composed by Dionysius “ the
Areopa- gite.” Louis the Pious turned the manuscript over to the
monastery of St. Denis, but nobody there could translate its Greek.
Erigena, at the King’s request, now undertook the task. The translation
deeply influenced Erigena, and re-established in unofficial Christian
theology the Neoplatonist picture of a universe evolving or emanating
out of God through different stages or degrees of diminishing
perfection, and slowly returning through different degrees back into the
deity.</p>
<p>This became the central idea of John’s own masterpiece, De divisione
na - turae (867). Here, amid much nonsense, and two centuries before
Abelard, is a bold subjection of theology and revelation to reason, and
an attempt to reconcile Christianity with Greek philosophy. John accepts
the authority of the Bible; but since its sense is often obscure, it
must be interpreted by reason —usually by symbolism or allegory.
“Authority,” says Erigena, “sometimes proceeds from reason, but reason
never from authority. For all authority that is not approved by true
reason seems weak. But true reason, since it rests on its own strength,
needs no reinforcement by any authority.” 49 “We should not allege the

<p>47^ THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xrather to authority than to reason.” 50 Here is the Age of Reason
moving in the womb of the Age of Faith.</p>
<p>John defines Nature as “the general name for all things that are and
that are not”— i.e., all objects, processes, principles, causes, and
thoughts. He di- vides Nature into four kinds of being: ( 1 ) that which
creates but is not cre- ated — viz., God; (2) that which is created and
creates — viz., the prime causes, principles, prototypes, Platonic
Ideas, Logos, by whose operation the world of particular things is made;
(3) that which is created and does not create — viz., the said world of
particular things; and (4) that which neither creates nor is created —
i.e., God as the final and absorbing end of all things. “God is
everything that truly is, since He makes all things and is made in all
things.” There was no creation in time, for this would imply a change in
God. “When we hear that God made everything, we ought to understand
nothing other than that God is in all things — i.e., subsists as the
essence of all things.” 51 “God Himself is comprehended by no intellect;
neither is the secret essence of anything created by Him comprehensible.
We perceive only accidents, not essences” ® 2 — phenomena, not noumena,
as Kant would say. The sensible qualities of things are not inherent in
the things themselves, but are pro- duced by our forms of perception.
“When we hear that God wishes, lo ves, chooses, sees, hears … we should
think nothing else than that His ineffable essence and power are being
expressed by meanings co- natural with us” (con - genial to our nature)
“lest the true and pious Christian be silenced concern - ing the
Creator, and dare say nothing of Him for the instruction of simple
souls.” 53 Only for a like purpose may we speak of God as masculine or
feminine; “He” is neither. 54 If we take “Father” as meaning the
creative sub - stance or essence of all things, and “Son” as the divine
Wisdom according to which all things are made or governed, and “Spirit”
as the life or vitality of creation, we may think of God as a Trinity.
Heaven and hell are not places, but conditions of soul; hell is the
misery of sin, heaven is the happiness of vir- tue and the ecstasy of
the divine vision (the perception of divinity) revealed in all things to
the soul that is pure. 55 The Garden of Eden was such a state of soul,
not a place on the earth. 50 All things are immortal: animals too, like
men, have souls that pass back, after death, into the God or creative
spirit from whom they emanated. 57 All history is a vast outward flow of
creation by emanation, and an irresistible inward tide that finally
draws all things back into God.</p>
<p>There have been worse philosophies than this, and in ages of
illumination. But the Church properly suspected it as reeking with
heresy. In 865 Pope Nicholas I demanded of Charles the Bald that he
should either send John to Rome for trial, or dismiss him f rom the
Palace School, “that he may no longer give poison to those who seek for
bread.” 53 We do not know the outcome. William of Malmesbury 59 relates
that “Johannes Scotus came to England and our monastery, as report says;
was pierced with the iron pens of the boys</p>
<p>CHAP.XIx) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 479</p>
<p>whom he instructed,” and died from the results; probably the tale was
a schoolboy’s wishful dream. Philosophers like Gerbert, Abelard, and
Gilbert de la Porr6e were secretly influenced by Erigena, but for the
most part he was forgotten in the chaos and darkness of the age. When in
the thirteenth century his book was exhumed from oblivion it was
condemned by the Council of Sens (1225), and Pope Honorius III ordered
that all copies should be sent to Rome and there be burned.</p>
<p>In these disturbed centuries French art marked time. Despite Charle-
magne’s example, the French continued to build their churches on the
basili - can plan. About 996 William of Volpiano, an Italian monk and
architect, became head of the Norman abbey of Fecamp. He brought with
him many of the devices of the Lombard and Romanesque style; and
apparently it was his pupils who built the great Romanesque abbey church
of Jumieges (1045-67). In 1042 another Italian, Lanfranc, entered the
Norman monas- tery at Bee, and soon made it a vibrant intellectual
center. Students flocked to it in such number that new buildings had to
be provided; Lanfranc designed them, perhaps with some more expert help.
Not a stone remains of his struc- tures; but the Abbaye aux Hommes at
Caen (1077-81) survives as a testi- mony to the powerful Romanesque
style developed in Normandy by Lan- franc and his fellows.</p>
<p>All over France and Flanders in the eleventh century new churches
were built, and artists adorned them with murals, mosaics, and statuary.
Charle- magne had directed that church interiors should be painted for
the instruc- tion of the faithful; the palaces at Aachen and Ingelheim
were decorated with frescoes; and doubtless many churches followed these
examples. The last fragments of the Aachen frescoes were destroyed in
1944; but similar murals survive in the church of St. Germain at
Auxerre. These differ only in scale from the style and figures in the
manuscript illumination of the time. At Tours, in the reign of Charles
the Bald, a great Bible was written and painted by the monks, and
presented to the King; it is now No. 1 of the Latin codices in the
Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. Still more beautiful is the “Lothaire”
Gospe l also made at this time by the monks of Tours. The monks of
Reims, in the same ninth century, produced the famous “Utrecht” Psalter
—108 vellum leaves containing the Psalms and the Apostles’ Creed, exuber
- antly illustrated with a veritable menagerie of animals and a museum
of tools and occupations. In these lively pictures a lusty realism
transforms the once stiff and conventional figures of miniature art.</p>
<p>5 . The Rise of the Dukes: 987-1066</p>
<p>The France that Hugh Capet ruled (987-996) now stood out as a
separate nation, no longer acknowledging the suzerainty of the Holy
Roman Empire;</p>
<p>4^0 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xthe unification of western continental Europe achieved by
Charlemagne was never restored, except momentarily by Napoleon and H
itler. But Hugh’s France was not our France; Aquitaine and Burgundy were
virtually inde- pendent duchies, and Lorraine would for seven centuries
attach itself to Germany. It was a France heterogeneous in race and
speech: northeastern France was more Flemish than French, and had a
large German element in its blood; Normandy was Norse; Brittany was
Celtic and aloof, dominated by refugees from Britain; Provence was still
in stock and speech a Roman- Gallic “province”; France near the Pyrenees
was Gothic ; Catalonia, tech- nically under the French monarchy, was
Goth-alonia. The Loire divided France into two regions of diverse
cultures and tongues. The task of the French monarchy was to unify this
diversity, and make a nation from a dozen peoples. The task would take
800 years.</p>
<p>To improve the chances of an orderly succession, Hugh, in the first
year of his reign, had had his son Robert crowned co-lcing. Robert the
Pious (996-</p>
<ol start="1031" type="1">
<li>is accounted a “mediocre king,” 60 perhaps because he shunned the
glory of war. Having some dispute over boundaries with the Emperor Henry
II of Germany, he arranged a meeting with him, exchanged presents, and
reached a peaceable agreement. Like Louis IX, Henry IV, and Louis XVI,
Robert had a kindly feeling for the weak and the poor, and protected
them as well as he could from the unscrupulous strong. He offended the
Church by marrying his cousin Bertha (998) , bore excommunication
patiently there- for and the taunts of those who thought her a witch;
finally he separated from her and lived unhappily forever afterward. At
his death, we are told, “There was great mourning and intolerable
grief.” 01 A war of succession followed between his sons; the elder,
Henry I ( 103 1-60) , won, but only by the help of Robert, Duke of
Normandy. When that long conflict (103 1-9) ended, the monarchy was so
impoverished in money and men that it could no longer prevent the
dismemberment of France by powerful and independ- ent lords.</li>
</ol>
<p>About the year 1000, through the gradual appropriation of surrounding
territory by great landowners, France was divided into seven main
princi- palities ruled by counts or dukes: Aquitaine, Toulouse,
Burgundy, Anjou, Champagne, Flanders, and Normandy. These dukes or
counts were in nearly all cases the heirs of chieftains or generals to
whom estates had been granted, for military or administrative services,
by the Merovingian or Carolingian kings. The king had become dependent
upon these magnates for mobilizing troops and protecting frontier
provinces; after 888 he no longer legislated for the whole realm, or
gathered taxes from it; the dukes and counts passed laws, levied taxes,
waged war, judged and punished, as practically sovereign powers on their
estates, and merely offered the king a formal homage and limited
military service. The authority of the king in law, justice, and finance
was narrowed to his own royal domain, later called the lie de France —
the</p>
<p>CHAP.XIX) THE DECLINE OF THE WEST 4 Sl</p>
<p>region of the Saone and middle Seine from Orleans to Beauvais and
from Chartres to Reims.</p>
<p>Of all the relatively independent duchies, Normandy grew most rapidly
in authority and power. Within a century after its cession to the
Northmen, it had become — perhaps through proximity to the sea and its
position between England and Paris — the most enterprising and
adventurous province in France. The Norse were now enthusiastic
Christians, had great monasteries and abbey schools, and reproduced with
a recklessness that would soon drive Norman youth to carve new kingdoms
out of old states. The progeny of the Vikings made strong governors, not
too finicky about their morals, nor pal- sied with scruples, but able to
rule with a firm hand a turbulent population of Gauls, Franks, and
Norse. Robert I (1028-35) was not y et duke of Nor- mandy when in 1026
his eye was caught by Harlette, daughter of a tanner in Falaise. She
became his cherished mistress according to an old Danish custom, and
soon presented him with a son known to his contemporaries as William the
Bastard, to us as William the Conqueror. Weighed down by his sins,
Robert in 1035 left Normandy on a penitential pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
Be- fore going he called his chief barons and prelates to him and said
to them:</p>
<p>By my faith, I will not leave ye lordless. I have a young bastard
who</p>
<p>will grow, please God, and of whose good qualities I have great
hope.</p>
<p>Take him, I pray you, for lord. That he was not born in wedlock mat-
ters little to you; he will be none the less able in battle … or to
render justice. I make him my heir, and I hold him seized, from this
present, of the whole duchy of Normandy . 62</p>
<p>Robert died en route; for a time nobles ruled for his son; but soon
William began to issue orders in the first person. A rebellion tried to
unseat him, but he put it down with dignified ferocity. He was a man of
craft and courage and farseeing plans, a god to his friends, a devil to
his foes. He bore with good humor many quips about his birth, and signed
himself, now and then, Gulielmus Nothus — William the Bastard; but when
he besieged Alengon, and the besieged hung hides over their walls in
allusion to his grandfather’s trade, he cut off the hands and feet, and
gouged out the eyes, of his prisoners, and shot these members from his
catapults into the town. Normandy admired his brutality and iron rule,
and prospered. William moderated the exploita- tion of the peasantry by
the nobles, and appeased these with fiefs; he domi- nated and presided
over the clergy, and appeased them with gifts. He attended devoutly to
his religious duties, and shamed his father by unprece- dented marital
fidelity. He fell in love with the beautiful Matilda, daughter of
Baldwin, Count of Flanders; he was not disconcerted by her two children
and her living but separated husband; she sent William away with
insults, saying that she “would rather be a veiled nun than marry a
bastard”; 63 he persevered, won her, and married her despite the
denunciations of the clergy.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XI</p>
<p>XHe deposed Bishop Malger and Abbot Lanfranc for condemning the mar-
riage, and burned down part of the abbey of Bee in his rage. Lanfranc
per- suaded Pope Nicholas II to validate the union; and William, in
atonement, built at Caen the famous Norman Abbaye aux Hommes. By this
marriage William allied himself with the Count of Flanders; in 1048 he
had already signed an entente with the king of France. Having so guarded
and garnished his flanks, he proceeded, at the age of thirty-nine, to
conquer England.</p>
