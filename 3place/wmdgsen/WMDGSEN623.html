<h4 id="chapter-xxviii-beethoven">CHAPTER XXVIII Beethoven</h4>
<p>1770 — 1827</p>
<p>I. YOUTH IN BONN: 177O-92</p>
<p>H E was born on December 16, 1770. Bonn was the seat of the prince-
archbishop elector of Cologne, one of those Rhineland principalities
which, before Napoleon “secularized” them, were ruled by Catholic arch -
bishops engagingly secular and inclined to support well-behaved artists.
A considerable part of Bonn’s 9,560 popula tion was dependent upon the
elec- toral establishment. Beethoven’s grandfather was a bass singer in
the Elec - tor’s choir; his father, Johann van Beethoven, was a tenor
there. The family, of Dutch stock, had come from a village near Louvain.
The Dutch van indicated place of origin, and did not, like the German
von or the French de, indicate titled and propertied nobility.
Grandfather and father were inclined to excessive drinking, and
something of this passed down to the composer.</p>
<p>In the year 1767 Johann van Beethoven married the young widow Maria
Magdalena Keverich Laym, daughter of a cook in Ehrensbreitstein. She de-
veloped into a mother much beloved by her famous son for her soft heart
and easy ways. She gave her husband seven children, four of whom died in
infancy. The survivors were the brothers Ludwig, Caspar Karl (1774-</p>
<p>1815), and Nikolaus Johann (1776-1848).</p>
<p>The father’s salary of three hundred florins as “Electoral Court
tenorist” was apparently his sole income. The family lived in a poor
quarter of Bonn, and the young Beethoven’s surroundings and associations
were not of a kind to make him a gentleman; he remained a roughhewn
rebel to the end. Hop- ing to improve the family income by developing a
son into a child prodigy, Beethoven’s father induced or compelled the
four -year-old boy to practice at the clavier or on the violin many
hours in the day, occasionally at night. Apparently the boy had no
spontaneous urge to music, 1 and (according to divers witnesses) he had
to be urged on by a severe discipline that some- times brought him to
tears. The torture succeeded, and the boy came to love the art that had
cost him so many painful hours. At the age of eight, with another pupil,
“he was displayed in a public concert, March 26, 1778, with financial
results unrecorded. In any case the father was encouraged to en- gage
teachers who could lead Ludwig into the higher subledes of music.</p>
<p>Aside from this he received little formal education. We hear of his
attend- ing a school where he learned enough Latin to salt some of his
letters with</p>
<p>567</p>
<p>5 6 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>humorous Latin inventions. He picked up enough French (which was the
Esperanto of the time) to write it intelligibly. He never learned to
spell correctly in any language, and seldom bothered to punctuate. But
he read some good books, ranging from Scott’s novels to Persian poetry,
and copied into his notebooks morsels of wisdom from his reading. His
only sport was in his fingers. He loved to improvise, and in that game
only Abt Vogler could match him.</p>
<p>In 1784 Maria Theresa’s youngest son, Maximilian Francis, was
appointed elector of Cologne, and took up his residence in Bonn. He was
a kindly man, enthusiastic about food and music; he became “the fattest
man in Eu - rope,” 2 but also he brought together an orchestra of thirty
-one pieces. Bee- thoven, aged fourteen, played the viola in that
ensemble, and was also listed as “deputy court organist,” with a salary
of 150 gulden (50?) per year. 3 A report to the Elector in 1785
described him as “of good capability,… of good, quiet behavior, and
poor.” 4</p>
<p>Despite some evidence of sexual ventures,* the good behavior and
grow- ing competence of the youth led to his receiving from the Elector
(1787) permission and funds for a trip to Vienna for instruction in
musical compo- sition. Soon after his arrival he was received by Mozart,
who heard him play, and praised him with disappointing moderation,
apparently thinking that the piece had been long rehearsed. Suspecting
this suspicion, Beethoven asked Mozart to give him, on the piano, a
theme for variations. Mozart was as- tonished at the youth’s fertility
of invention and sureness of touch, and said to his friends, “Keep your
eyes on him; someday he will give the world something to talk about”; 6
but this story has too familiar an air. Mozar t ap- pears to have given
the boy some lessons, but the death of Mozart’s father,</p>
<p>The father, whose tenor voice had long since decayed, wrote to the
Elector, describing his extreme poverty, and appealing for help. No
answer is recorded, but another singer in the choir came to the rescue.
In 1788 Ludwig himself added to the family income by giving piano
lessons to Eleonore von Breuning and her brother Lorenz. Their widowed,
wealthy, cultured mother received the young teacher into full equality
with her chil- dren, and the friendships so formed helped in some
measure to smooth the sharp comers of Beethoven’s character.</p>
<p>Helpful, too, was the kindness of Count Ferdinand von Waldstein
(1762-</p>
<p>1823), himself a good musician, and a close friend of the Elector.
Learning of Beethoven’s poverty, he sent him occasional gifts of money,
pretending</p>
<p>*The post-mortem examination of Beethoven revealed various internal
disorders which Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians (3d ed., I,
271b) described as “most probably the result of syphilitic affections at
an early period of his life.” Thayer, biographer par excellence of
Beethoven, put the matter politely: Beethoven “had not escaped the
common penalties of transgressing the laws of strict purity” 5 The
matter is s till debated.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) BEETHOVEN 569</p>
<p>hat they were from the Elector. Beethoven later dedicated to him the
piano sonata (Opus 53 in C Major) that bears his name.</p>
<p>Ludwig needed help more than ever now, for his despondent father had
surrendered to alcohol, and had been with difficulty rescued from arrest
as a public nuisance. In 1789 Beethoven, not yet nineteen, took upon
himself the responsibility for his younger brothers, and became legal
head of the family. A decree of the Elector (November 20) ordered that
the services of Johann van Beethoven should be dispensed with, and that
half of his annual salary of two hundred reichsthalers should be paid
him, and the other half to his eldest son. Beethoven continued to earn a
small sum as chief pianist and second organist in the Elector’s
orchestra.</p>
<p>In 1790, flush with a triumph in London, Franz Joseph Haydn stopped
at Bonn on his way home to Vienna. Beethoven presented to him a cantata
that he had recently composed; Haydn praised it. Probably some word of
this reached the Elector’s ear; he listened favorably to suggestions
that he allow the youth to go to Vienna for study with Haydn, and to
continue for some months to receive his sala ry as a musician on the
Elector’s staff. Probably Count von Waldstein had won this boon for his
young friend. He wrote in Ludwig’s album a farewell note: “Dear
Beethoven, you are travel - ing to Vienna in fulfillment of your
long-cherished wish. The genius of Mozart [who had died on December 5,
1791] is still weeping and bewailing the death of her favorite…. Labor
assiduously and receive Mozart’s spirit from the hands of Haydn. Your
true friend Waldstein.”</p>
<p>Beethoven left Bonn, father, family, and friends on or about November
1,</p>

<li>Soon afterward French Revolutionary troops occupied Bonn, and the

</ol>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>PROGRESS AND TRAGEDY: 1792-1802</li>
</ol>
<p>Arrived in Vienna, he found the city alive with musicians competing
for patrons, audiences, and publishers, looking askance at every
newcomer, and finding no disarming beauty in the youth from Bonn. He was
short, stocky, dark- complexioned (Anton Esterhazy called him “the
Moor”), pock -</p>
<p>marked, front upper teeth overlapping the lower, nose broad and flat,
eyes deepset and challenging, and head “like a bullet,” wearing a wig
and a van. He was not designed for popularity, with either the public or
his competi- tors, but he was rarely without a rescuing friend.</p>
<p>Soon came news that his father had died (December 18, 1792). Some
diffi- culty having developed about Beethoven’s share in his father’s
small annuity, he petitioned the Elector for its continuance; the
Elector responded by dou- bling it, and adding: “He is further to
receive three measures of grain… for the education of his brothers”
(Karl and Johann, who had moved to Vi - enna). 7 Beethoven, grateful,
made some good resolutions. In a friend’s al - bum, May 22, 1793, he
wrote, using the words of Schiller’s Don Carlos: “I am not wicked— Hot
blood is my fault — my crime is that I am young….</p>
<p>570 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Even though wildly surging emotions may betray my heart, yet my heart
is good.” He resolved “to do good wherever possible, to love liberty
above all else, never to deny the truth, even before the throne.” 8</p>
<p>He kept his expenditures to a stoic minimum: for December, 1792,
four- teen florins (5?) for rent; six florins for rent of a piano;
“eating, each time 12 kreuzer” (six cents); “meals with wine, 6 l / 2
florins” (6.25??). An - other memorandum lists “Haidn” at various times
as costing two groschen (a few cents); apparently Haydn was asking
little for his lessons. For a while the student accepted correction
humbly. But as the lessons continued, Haydn found it impossible to
accept Beethoven’s reported deviations from orthodox rules of
composition. Toward the end of 1793 Beethoven quit his aging master, and
went three times a week to study counterpoint with a man more famous as
teacher than as composer, Johann Georg Albrechts- berger. Concurrently,
three times a week, he studied violin with Ignaz Schup- panzigh. In
1795, having taken all that he felt need of from Albrechtsberger, he
applied to Antonio Salieri, then director of the Vienna Opera, for
instruc- tion in composition for the voice. Salieri charged nothing to
poor pupils; Beethoven presented himself as such, and was accepted. All
four of these teachers found him a difficult disciple, bursting with
ideas of his own, and resenting the formalism of the musical theory
offered him. We can imagine the shudders generated in “Papa Haydn” (who
lived till 1809) by the ir - regularities and sonorities of Beethoven’s
compositions.</p>
<p>Despite — perhaps because of — his deviations from traveled roads,
Beetho- ven’s performances won him, by 1794, a reputation as the most
interesting pianist in Vienna. The pianoforte had won its battle with
the harpsichord; Johann Christian Bach in 1768 had begun performing
solos on it in England; Mozart adopted it, Haydn followed suit in 1780,
Muzio Clementi was com- posing concertos definitely designed for the
piano and its new flexibility between piano and forte, between staccato
and sostenuto. Beethoven made full use of the piano’s powers and his
own, especially in his improvisations, where no printed notation
hampered his style. Ferdinand Ries, pupil of both Haydn and Beethoven,
later declared: “No a rtist that I ever heard came at all near the
height which Beethoven attained in this branch of playing. The wealth of
ideas which forced themselves on him, the caprices to which he
surrendered himself, the variety of treatment, the difficulties, were
in- exhaustible.” 9</p>
<p>It was as a pianist that the patrons of music first appreciated him.
At an evening concert in the home of Baron van Swieten, after the
program had been completed, the host (biographer Schindler relates)
“detained Beetho - ven and persuaded him to add a few fugues of Bach as
an evening bless- ing.” 10 Prince Karl Lichnowsky— the leading amateur
musician in Vienna — so liked Beethoven that he regularly engaged him
for his Friday musicales, and for a time entertained him as a house
guest; Beethoven, however, could not adjust himself to the Prince’s meal
hours, and preferred a nearby hotel. The most enthusiastic of the
composer’s titled patrons was Prince Lob - kowitz, an excellent
violinist, who spent nearly all his income on music and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>BEETHOVEN</p>
<p>571</p>
<p>musicians; for years he helped Beethoven, despite quarrels, and he
took in good spirit Beethoven’s insistence on being treated as a social
equal. The ladies of these helpful nobles enjoyed his proud
independence, took lessons and scoldings from him, and allowed the poor
bachelor to make love to them, in letters. 11 They and their lords
accepted his dedications, and rewarded him moderately.</p>
<p>So far his fame was only as a pianist, and, as such, it reached
Prague and Berlin, to which he made visits as a virtuoso in 1796. But
meanwhile he composed. On October 21, 1795, he published, as his Opus I,
Three Grand Trios, about which Johann Cramer, after playing them,
announced, “This is the man who is to console us for the loss of
Mozart.” 12 Stimulated by such praise, Beethoven wrote in his notebook:
“Courage! Despite all bodily weak - nesses my spirit shall rule…. This
year must determine the complete man. Nothing must remain undone.”
13</p>
<p>In 1797 Napoleon, unseen, first came into Beethoven’s life. The young
general, having driven the Austrians from Lombardy, had led his army
over the Alps, and was nearing Vienna. The surprised capital
extemporized de- fense as well as it could with guns and hymns; now
Haydn wrote Austria’s national anthem — “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser,
unsern guten Kaiser Franz”; and Beethoven produced music for another war
song— “Ein grosses deutsches Volk sind wir.” These spirited compositions
were later to be worth many regiments, but they did not move Napoleon,
who exacted a hu- miliating peace.</p>
<p>A year later General Bernadotte came to Vienna as the new French am-
bassador, and shocked the citizens by raising from his balcony the
French Revolutionary tricolor flag. Beethoven, who had frankly expressed
republi- can ideas, openly declared his admiration of Bonaparte, and was
often seen at the ambassador’s receptions. 14 Apparently it was
Bernadotte who sugges ted to Beethoven the idea of a composition
honoring Napoleon. 13</p>
<p>Seeking to tap nearer services, Ludwig in 1799 dedicated his Opus 13,
“Grande Sonate Pathetique,” to Prince Lichnowsky, in gratitude for
favors received or hoped for. The Prince responded ( 1800) by putting
six hundred gulden at Beethoven’s disposal “until I obtain a suitable
appointment.” 16 This sonata began simply, as if in humble filiation
from Mozart; then it proceeded to a difficult intricacy that would later
seem simple beside the almost aggres- sive complexity and power of the
Hammerklavier Sonatas or the “Appas - sionata.” Still easy on eyes and
hands were the First Symphony (1800) and the “Moonlight Sonata” in C
sharp minor (1801). B eethoven did not give the latter piece its famous
name, but called it “Sonata quasi Fantasia.” Ap - parendy he had no
intention of making it a love song. It is true that he dedi- cated it to
the Countess Giulia Guicciardi, who was among the untouchable goddesses
of his reveries, but it had been written for another occasion, quite
unrelated to this divinity. 17</p>
<p>To the year 1802 belongs one of the strangest and most appealing
docu- ments in the history of music. This secret “Heiligenstadt
Testament”— which was not seen by others till found in Beethoven’s
papers after his</p>
<p>57 2 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>death — is intelligible only through a frank confrontation of his
character.</p>
<p>His early environment scarred him lastingly; he could never forget,
and never forgive, the toilsome, anxious poverty, or the humiliation of
seeing his father surrender to failure and drink. He himself, as the
years saddened him, yielded more and more to the amnesia of wine. 18 In
Vienna his stature (five feet five inches) invited wit, and his face was
no fortune; his hair thick, di- sheveled, bristling; his heavy beard
spreading up to his sunken eyes, and sometimes allowed to grow to half
an inch befo re shaving. 19 “Oh God!” he cried in 1819, “what a plague
it is to one when he has so fatal a face as mine!” 20</p>
<p>These physical disadvantages were probably a spur to achievement,
but, after the first few years in Vienna, they discouraged care of his
dress, his body, his rooms, or his manners. “I am an untidy fellow,” he
wrote (April 22, 1801); “perhaps the only touch of genius which I
possess is that my things are not always in very good order.” He earned
enough to keep ser - vants, but he soon quarreled with them, and seldom
kept them long. He was brusque with the lowly; with the highborn he was
sometimes obsequious, often proud, even arrogant. He was merciless in
assessing his rivals, and was rewarded by their almost unanimous
dislike. He was severe with his pupils, but taught some of them without
charge. 21</p>
<p>He was a misanthrope, judging every man basically base, but fondly
for- giving his troublesome nephew Karl, and loving every pretty pupil.
He gave to nature the unquestioning affection that he could not offer to
mankind. He frequently fell into melancholy moods, but almost as
frequently had spells of raucous jollity, with or without wine. He had
an often inconsiderate sense of humor (e.g., Letters 14, 22, 25, 30 22
), punned at every opportunity, and invented sometimes offensive
nicknames for his friends. He could laugh more readily than he could
smile.</p>
<p>He tried, through worried years, to conceal from the world the
affliction that embittered his life. In a letter of June 29, 1801, he
revealed it to a friend of his youth, Franz Wegeler:</p>
<p>For the last three years my hearing has become weaker and weaker. The
trouble is supposed to have been caused by the condition of my abdomen,
which… was wretched even before I left Bonn, but has become worse in
Vienna, where I have been constantly afflicted with diarrhea, and have
been suffering in consequence from an extraordinary disability…. Such
was my condition until the autumn of last year, and sometimes I gave way
to despair.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>BEETHOVEN</p>
<p>I must confess that I lead a wretched life. For almost two years I
have ceased to attend any social functions, just because I find it
impossible to say to people: I am deaf. If I had any other profession I
might be able to cope with my infirmity; but in my profession it is a
terrible calamity. Heaven alone knows what is to become of me. Already I
have cursed my Creator and my existence… I beg you not to say anything
about my condition to anyone, not even to Lorchen [Eleonore von
Breuning].</p>
<p>Apparently in hopes of profiting from its sulfur baths, Beethoven
spent part of 1802 in Heiligenstadt, a small village near Gottingen.
Wandering in nearby woods, he saw, at a short distance, a shepherd
playing a pipe. As he heard no sound, he realized that now only the
louder sounds of an orchestra would reach him. He had already begun to
conduct as well as to perform and compose; and the implications of this
peasant’s unheard pipe thfew him into despair. He went to his room and
composed, on October 6, 1802, what is known as the “Heiligenstadt
Testament,” a spiritual will and apologia pro vita sua. Though he
captioned it “For my brothers Carl and Beetho -</p>
<p>ven,” he carefully concealed the document from all eyes but his own.
It is here transcribed in its essential lines:</p>
<p>O ye men who think and say that I am malevolent, stubborn, or misan-
thropic, how greatly do ye wrong me, you who do not know the secret
cause of my seeming so. From childhood my heart and mind were disposed
to the gentle feeling of good will, I was even ever eager to accomplish
great deeds, but reflect now that for 6 years I have been in a hopeless
case, aggravated by senseless physicians,… finally compelled to face the
prospect of a last- ing malady… Born with an ardent and lively
temperament, even suscepti- ble to the diversions of society, I was
compelled early to isolate myself, to live in loneliness, when I at
times tried to forget all this, O how harshly was I repulsed by the
doubly sad experience of my bad hearing, and yet it was impossible for
me to say to men speak louder, shout, for I am deaf. Ah how could I
possibly admit an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more
perfect in me than in others… O I cannot do it, therefore forgive me
when you see me draw back when I would gladly mingle with you…. What a
humiliation when one stood beside me and heard a flute in the dis- tance
and 1 heard nothing…. Such incidents brought me to the verge of despair;
but little more and I would have put an end to my life — only art it was
that withheld me, ah, it seemed impossible to leave the world until I
had produced all that I felt called upon to produce…. O Divine One thou
lookest into my inmost soul, and thou knowest it, thou knowest that love
of man and desire to do good lives therein. O men, when someday you read
these words, reflect that ye did me wrong…. You my brothers Carl and</p>
<p>as soon as I am dead if Dr. Schmid is still alive ask him in my name
to</p>
<p>describe my malady and attach this document to the history of my
illness so that so far as possible at least the world may become
reconciled with me after my death. At the same time I declare you two to
be the heirs of my small fortune…. It is my wish that your lives may be
better and freer from care than I have had, recommend virtue to your
children, it alone can give happiness, not money, I speak from
experience, it was virtue that upheld me in my misery, to it next to my
art I owe the fact that I did not end my life by suicide — Farewell and
love each other… with joy I hasten toward death. In the margin he wrote:
“To be read and executed after my death.” 23 It was not a suicide note;
it was both hopeless and resolute. Beethoven</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>proposed to accept and transcend his hardship, and bring to other
ears than his own all the music that lay silent within him. Almost at
once — still in Heiligenstadt in November, 1802 — he composed his Second
Symphony, in D, wherein there is no note of complaint or grief. Only one
year after his cry from the depths he composed his Third Symphony, the
Eroica, and entered with it his second and most creative period.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE HEROIC YEARS: 1803-09</li>
</ol>
<p>The learned musicologists who have been trailed in these hesitant
pages divide Beethoven’s productive career into three periods: 1792
-1802; 1803-16; 1817-24. In the first he worked tentatively in the
simple and placid? style of Mozart and Haydn. In the second period he
made greater demands upon the performers in tempo, dexterity, and force;
he explored contrasts of mood from tenderness to power; he gave rein to
his inventiveness in variation, and to his flair for improvisation, but
he subjected these to the logic of affiliation and development; he
changed the sex of the sonata and the symphony from feminine sentiment
and delicacy to masculine assertiveness and will. As if to signalize the
change, Beethoven now replaced the minuet in the third move- ment with a
scherzo frolicking with notes, laughing in the face of fate. Now he
found in music an answer to misfortune: he could absorb himself in the
creation of music that would make the death of his body a passing
incident in an extended life. “When I am playing and composing, my
affliction… hampers me least.” 24 He could no longer hear his melodies
with his physical ears, but he could hear them with his eyes, with the
musician’s secret ability to transfer imagined tones into spots and
lines of ink, and then hear them, soundless, from the printed pages.</p>
<p>Almost all the works of this period became classics, appearing
through suc- ceeding generations in orchestral repertoires. The
“Kreutzer Sonata,” Opus 47, composed in 1803 for violinist George
Bridgetower, was dedicated to Rodolphe Kreutzer, teacher of the violin
in the Paris Conservatory of Music; Beethoven had met him in Vienna in
1798. Kreutzer judged the piece alien to his style or mood, and seems
never to have played it publicly.</p>
<p>Beethoven ranked as the best of his symphonies the Eroica , 26
composed in 1803-04. Half the world knows the story about its original
dedication to Napoleon. Despite his titled friends and judicious
dedications, Beethoven remained to the end of his life a resolute
republican; and he applauded the seizure and reconstitution of the
French government by Bonaparte in 1799- 1800 as a move toward
responsible rule. In 1802, however, he expressed his regret that
Napoleon had signed a concordat with the Church. “Now,” he wrote,
“everything is going back to the old track.” 26 As to the dedication,
let an eyewitness, Ferdinand Ries, tell the tale:</p>
<p>In this symphony Beethoven had Bonaparte in his mind, but as he was
when he was First Consul. Beethoven esteemed him greatly at the time,
and likened</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>BEETHOVEN</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>him to the greatest Roman consuls. I as well as several of his more
intimate friends saw a copy of the [ Eroica ] score lying upon his
table, with the word “Buonaparte” at the extreme top of the title page,
and at the extreme bottom “Luigi van Beethoven” but not another word…. I
was the first to bring him the intelligence that Bonaparte had
proclaimed himself emperor, where- upon he flew into a rage, and cried
out, “Is then he too nothing more than an ordinary human being? Now he
will trample on all the rights of man, and indulge only his ambition. He
will exalt himself above all others, become a tyrant.” Beethoven went to
the tabl e, took hold of the title page by the top, tore it in two, and
threw it on the floor. The first page was rewritten and only then did
the symphony receive the title “Sinfonia eroica.” 27</p>
<p>When the symphony was published (1805) it bore the title Sinfonia
eroica per festeggiare il sovvenira d’un gran uomo— “Heroic symphony to
celebrate the memory of a great man.” 28</p>
<p>It received its first public performance April 7, 1805, in the
Theater-an- der-Wien. Beethoven conducted despite his defective hearing.
His style of conducting accorded with his character — excitable,
demanding, “most ex - travagant. At a pianissimo he would crouch down so
as to be hidden by the desk; and then, as the crescendo increased, would
gradually rise, beating all the time, until at the fortissimo he would
spring into the air, with his arms extended as if wishing to float on
the clouds.” 29 The symphony was criti - cized for “strange modulations
and violent transitio ns,… undesirable origi- nality,” and excessive
length; the critic advised Beethoven to go back to his earlier and
simpler style. 30 Beethoven winced and growled, and worked on.</p>
<p>Giving another hostage to fortune, he tried his hand at opera; on
Novem- ber 20, 1805, he conducted the premiere of Leonore. But
Napoleon’s troops had occupied Vienna on November 13; the Emperor
Francis and the leading nobles had fled; the citizens were in no mood
for opera; the performance</p>
<p>was a resounding failure despite the applause of the French officers
in the scanty audience. Beethoven was told that his opera was too long,
and clum- sily arranged. He shortened and revised it, and offered it a
second time on March 29, 1806; again it failed. Eight years later, when
the city teemed with the Congress of Vienna, the opera, renamed Fidelio,
was given a third trial, and achieved a moderate success. Beethoven’s
mode of composition had be - come attuned to instruments with greater
range and flexibility than the human voice; the singers, however anxious
to break new barriers, simply could not sing some soaring passages, and
at last they rebelled. The opera is occasionally staged today, borne on
the wings of the composer’s fame, and with revisions that he can no
longer revise.</p>
<p>From that difficult and unrewarding experience he passed to one
master- piece after another. In 1805 he presented Piano Concerto in G,
No. 4, Opus 58, second only to the fifth in the affection of virtuosos.
He celebrated the year 1806 with the Sonata in F Minor, Opus 57, later
christened “Appas - sionata,” and added three quartets, Opus 59,
dedicated to Count Andreas Razumovsky, Russian ambassador at Vienna. In
March, 1807, Beethoven’s friends, probably to console him for the
failure of his opera, organized a benefit concert for him; there he
conducted his Symphonies No. One, Two,</p>
<p>576 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>XXand Three (the Eroica ), and his new Symphony No. Four in B Flat,
Opus</p>
<ol start="60" type="1">
<li>We are not told how the audience bore up under this surfeit.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1806 Prince Miklos Nicolaus Esterhazy commissioned Beethoven to
compose a Mass for the name day of his wife. Beethoven went to the
Ester- hazy chateau at Eisenstadt in Hungary, and presented there his
Mass in C, Opus 86, on September 13, 1807. After the performance the
Prince asked him, “But, my dear Beethoven, what is this that you have
done again?” Beethoven interpreted the question as expressing
dissatisfaction, and he left the chateau before his invitation had run
out.</p>
<p>He signalized 1808 with two symphonies now known throughout the
world: Symphony No. Five in C Minor, and the Sixth or Pastoral Sym-
phony in F. They appear to have been composed concurrently through sev-
eral years, in alternations of mood between the brooding of the Fifth
and the gaiety of the Sixth; fitly they received their premiere together
on Decem- ber 22, 1808. Frequent repetitions have lessened their charm,
even for old music lovers; we are no l onger moved by “Fate knocking at
the door,” or birds warbling in the trees; but perhaps the fading of our
enchantment is due to lack of the musical education that might have
equipped us to follow with appreciation and pleasure the logic of
thematic contrasts and develop- ments, the cooperation of counterpoint,
the playful rivalry of different in- struments, the dialogue of winds
and strings, the mood of each movement, the structure and direction of
the whole. Minds are differently molded — some to feelings, some to
ideas; it must have been as hard for Hegel to under- stand Beethoven as
for Beethoven — or anyone — to understand Hegel.</p>
<p>In 1808-09 he composed the Piano Concerto No. 5 in E Flat, Opus 73,
known as the “Emperor.” Of all his works this is t he most lovable, the
most enduringly beautiful, the one of which we never tire; however often
we have heard it, we are moved beyond words by its sparkling vivacity,
its gay in- ventiveness, its inexhaustible fountains of feeling and
delight. In this con- certo a man rising triumphantly out of apparent
disaster wrote an ode to joy far niore convincing than the stentorian
chorus of the Ninth Symphony.</p>
<p>Perhaps the happiness of the “Emperor Concerto” and the Pastoral Sym
- phony reflected Beethoven’s inc reasing prosperity. In 1 804 he had
been en- gaged as piano teacher by Archduke Rudolf, youngest son of the
Emperor Francis; so began a friendship that often helped the
increasingly discreet republican. In 1808 he received a flattering offer
from Jerome Bonaparte, king of Westphalia, to come and serve as
Kapellmeister in the royal choir and orchestra at Cassel. Beethoven
agreed to fill the post at six hundred gold ducats per year; apparently
he had still some faith in his dying ears. When word spread that he was
negotiating with Cassel, his friends protested against what they called
disloyalty to Vienna; he answered that he had toiled there for sixteen
years without receiving a secure position. On February 26, 1809, the
Archduke sent him a formal agreement by which, in return for Beetho-
ven’s remaining in Vienna, he would be guaranteed an annual sum of 4,000
florins, of which Rudolf would pay 1,500, Prince Lobkowitz 700, and
Count Elinsky 1,800; in addition Beethoven might keep whatever he
earned. He</p>

<p>577</p>
<p>accepted, and stayed. In that year 1809 Papa Haydn died, and
Beethoven in- herited his crown.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE LOVER</li>
</ol>
<p>Having achieved economic stability, he returned to his lifelong quest
for a wife. He was a warmly sexual man. Presumably he found a variety of
outlets, 31 but he had long felt the need for a permanent companionship.
In Bonn, according to his friend Wegeler, he was “always loving.” In
1801 he mentioned to Wegeler “a dear sweet girl who loves me and whom I
love.” This is generally supposed to have been his seventeen-year-old
pupil Count- ess Giulia Guicciardi; however, she married Count
Gallenberg. In 1805 Bee- thoven centered his hopes upon the widowed
Countess Josephine von Deym, to whom he sent a passionate
declaration:</p>
<p>Here I give you a solemn promise that in a short time I shall stand
before you more worthy of myself and of you — Oh, if only you would
attach some value to this — I mean to founding my happiness by means of
your love…. Oh, beloved Josephine, it is no desire for the other sex
that draws me near to you, it is just you , your whole self, with all
your individual qualities — this has compelled my regard — this has
bound all my feelings — all my emotional power — to you…. You make me
hope that your heart will long beat for me — Mine can only — cease — to
beat for you — when — it no longer beats. 32</p>
<p>Apparently the lady turned to other prospects. Two years later
Beethoven was still appealing to be admitted to her presence; she did
not reply.</p>
<p>In March, 1807, he paid such devout attentions to Mme. Marie Bigot
that her husband protested. Beethoven sent “Dear Maria, dear Bigot,” a
letter</p>
<p>On March 14, 1809, expecting to be in Freiburg, he wrote to Baron von
Gleichenstein:</p>
<p>Now you can help me to look for a wife. Indeed, you might find
some</p>
<p>beautiful girl at F who would perhaps now and then grant a sigh to my
harmonies…. If you do find one, please form the connection in advance. —
But she must be beautiful, for it is impossible for me to love anything
that is not beautiful — or else I should have to love myself 34</p>
<p>But this was presumably one of Beethoven’s jokes.</p>
<p>More serious was his affair with Therese Malfatti. She was another of
his pupils, daughter of a distinguished physician. A letter to her of
May 8, 1810, has some of the air of an accepted lover. On May 2
Beethoven had sent an urgent request to Wegeler, then at Coblenz, to go
to Bonn and locate and send him the composer’s baptismal certificate,
for “I have been said to be older than I am.” Wegeler complied.
Beethoven made no acknowledgment, and in July Stephan von Breuning wrote
to Wegeler: “I believe his marriage project has fallen through, and for
this reason he no longer feels the lively desire to thank you for your
trouble.” Till his fortieth year he insisted that</p>
<p>578 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>he had been born in ’1772. The baptismal certificate gave his birth
year as I 77°-</p>
<p>After his death three letters were found in a locked drawer which are
among the most tender and fervent love letters in history. They were
never sent. As they name no name, no year, and no address, they remain a
mystery that has produced its own literature. The first letter, dated
“July 6, in the morning,” tells of Beethoven’s hectic three -day trip
from Vienna to a woman in an unstated place in Hungary. Some
phrases:</p>
<p>My angel, my all, my very self…. Can our love endure except through
sacrifices — except through not demanding everything — can you change it
that you are not wholly mine, I not wholly thine. Oh, God! look out into
the beauties of nature, and comfort yourself with that which must be —
love de- mands everything…. We shall soon surely see each other…. My
heart is full of many things to say to you — ah, there are moments when
I feel that speech is nothing after all — cheer up — remain my true, my
only treasure, my all as I am yours….</p>
<p>Your faithful</p>
<p>Ludwig</p>
<p>The second and much briefer letter is dated “Evening, Monday, July
6,” and ends: “ Oh God! so near so far! Is our love not truly a
celestial edifice- firm as heaven’s vault.” The third letter:</p>
<p>Good morning, on July 7</p>
<p>Though still in bed my thoughts go out to you, Meine unsterbliche</p>
<p>Geliebte [my immortal beloved], now and then joyfully, then sadly,
waiting to learn whether or not fate will hear us. I can live only
wholly with you, or not at all — yes I am resolved to wander so long
away from you until I can fly to your arms and say that I am really at
home, send my soul enwrapped in you into the land of spirits…. Oh God,
why is it necessary to part from one whom one so loves and yet my life
in W[ien — Vienna] is now a wretched life — your love makes me at once
the happiest and the unhappiest of men — at my age I need a steady,
quiet life…. Be calm, only by a calm consideration of our existence can
we achieve our purpose to live together — be calm — love me — today —
yesterday — what tearful longings for you — My life — my all — farewell
— Oh, continue to love me — never misjudge the most faithful heart of
your beloved L.</p>
<p>Ever thine, ever mine, ever for each other. 35</p>
<p>Who was she? No one knows. The pundits are divided, chiefly between
the Countess Guicciardi-Gallenberg and the Countess Therese von Bruns-
wig; nothing short of a countess would do. Apparently the lady was mar-
ried; if so, Beethoven, in wooing her, was forgetting the excellent
principle he had professed to the Bigots. However, the letters were not
sent; no harm was done; and music may have profited.</p>
<p>V. BEETHOVEN AND GOETHE: 1809-12</p>
<p>In 1 809 Austria was again at war with France. In May French
cannonballs were dropping on Vienna; court and nobility fled; Beethoven
sought refuge in a cellar. The city surrendered, the victors taxed the
commonalty a tenth</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>BEETHOVEN</p>
<p>of a year’s income, the well -to-do a third. Beethoven paid, but,
from a safe distance, shook his fist at a patrolling Gaul, and cried,
“If I, as a general, knew as much about strategy as I, the composer,
know about counterpoint, I’d give you something to do!” 36</p>
<p>Otherwise, the period from 1809 to 1815 shows Beethoven in relatively
good spirits. In those years he often visited the home of Franz
Brentano, prosperous merchant and patron of art and music, who sometimes
helped Ludwig with a loan. Franz’s wife, Antonie, was at times confined
to her room with illness; more than once, during such spells, Beethoven
came in quietly, played the piano, then left without a word, having
spoken to her in his own language. On one such occasion he was
surprised, as he played, by hands placed upon his shoulders. Turning, he
found a young woman (then twenty-five), pretty, her eyes glowing with
pleasure over his playing — even over his singing, to his own music,
Goethe’s famous lyric about Italy, “Kennst du das Land.” She was
Elisabeth— “Bettina”— Brentano, sister to Franz, and to the Clemens
Brentano whom we shall meet as a famous Ger- man author. She herself was
later to produce a number of successful books presenting autobiography
and fiction in a now inextricable mixture. She is our only authority for
the story just told, and for the later episode in which, at a party in
Franz’s ho me, she heard Beethoven discourse not only pro- foundly, but
with an order and elegance not generally ascribed to him, though
sometimes appearing in his letters. On May 28, 1810, she wrote en-
thusiastically about him to Goethe, whom she knew not merely through
neighborly relations with his family in Frankfurt, but through a visit
with him in Weimar. Some excerpts from this famous letter:</p>
<p>When I saw him of whom I shall now speak to you, I foirgot the whole
world…. It is Beethoven of whom I now wish to tell you, and who made me
forget the world and you…. He stalks far ahead of the culture of man-
kind. Shall we ever overtake him? — I doubt it, but grant that he may
live until the… enigma lying in his soul is fully developed,… then
surely he will place the key to his heavenly knowledge in our
hands….</p>
<p>He himself said, “When I open my eyes I must sigh, for what I see is
con - trary to my religion, and I must despise the world which does not
know that music is a higher revelation than wisdom and philosophy, the
wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am the
Bacchus -who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them
spiritually drunken…. I have no fear for my music — it can meet no evil
fate. Those who understand it must be freed by it from all the miseries
which the others drag about with them….</p>
<p>“Music is the mediator between intellectual and sensuous life. I
should like to talk to Goethe about this — would he understand me?…
Speak to Goethe about me;… tell him to hear my symphonies, and he will
say that I am right in saying that music is the one incorporeal entrance
into the higher world of knowledge.”</p>
<p>Bettina transmitted to Goethe these raptures of Beethoven, and added:
“Rejoice me now with a speedy answer, which shall show Beethoven that
you appreciate him.” Goethe replied on June 6, 1810:</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Your letter, heartily beloved child, reached me at a happy time. You
have been at great pains to picture for me a great and beautiful nature
in its achieve- ments and its striving…. I feel no desire to contradict
what I can grasp of your hurried explosion; on the contrary I should
prefer for the present to admit an agreement between my nature and that
which is recognizable in these manifold utterances. The ordinary human
mind might, perhaps, find contradictions in it; but before that which is
uttered by one possessed of such a demon, an ordinary layman must stand
in reverence…. Give Beethoven my heartiest greetings, and tell him that
I would willingly make sacrifices to have his acquaintance…. You may be
able to persuade him to make a journey to Karlsbad, whither I go nearly
every year, and would have the greatest leisure to listen to him and
learn from him. 37</p>
<p>Beethoven was unable to get to Karlsbad, but the two supreme artists
of their time met at Teplitz (a watering place in Bohemia) in July,
1812. Goethe visited Beethoven’s lodgings there, and gave a first
impression in a letter to his wife: “A more self -centered, energetic,
sincere artist I never saw. I can understand right well how singular
must be his attitude toward the world.” 38 On July 21 and 23 he spent
the evenings with Beethoven, who, he reported, “played delightfully.”
Familiar the story how, on one of their walks together,</p>
<p>here came towards them the whole court, the Empress [of Austria] and
the dukes. Beetho ven said: “Keep hold of my arm, they must make room
for us, not we for them.” Goethe was of a different opinion, and the
situation became awkward for him; he let go of Beethoven’s arm and took
a stand at the side with his hat off, while Beethoven with folded arm
walked right through the dukes and only tilted his hat slightly while
the dukes stepped aside to make room for him, and all greeted him
pleasantly; on the other side he stopped and waited for Goethe, who had
permitted the company to pass by him where he stood with bowed head.
“Well,” Beethoven said, “I’ve waited for you be - cause I honor and
respect you as you deserve, but you did those yonder too much honor.”
39</p>
<p>This was Beethoven’s account, according to Bettina, who adds:
“Afterward</p>
<p>Dubious as they sound, both stories harmonize with authentic
expressions in which the two geniuses summarized their meetings. On
August 9 Beetho- ven wrote to his Leipzig publishers, Breitkopf and
Hartel: “Goethe is too fond of the atmosphere of the court, more so than
is becoming to a poet.” On September 2 Goethe wrote to Karl Zelter:</p>
<p>I made Beethoven’s acquaintance in Teplitz. His talent amazed me.
Unfortu - nately he is an utterly untamed personality, not altogether in
the wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but who does not make
it any the more enjoyable either for himself or for others by his
attitude. He is very excusable, on the other hand, and much to be
pitied, as his hearing is leaving him, which,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) BEETHOVEN 58 1</p>
<p>perhaps, mars the musical part of his nature less than the social. He
is of a laconic nature, and will become doubly so because of this lack.
41</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE LAST VICTORIES: 1811-24</li>
</ol>
<p>Wherever he went he composed. In 1 8 1 1 he gave final form to Opus
97 in B Flat, a trio for piano, violin and violoncello, and dedicated it
to the Arch- duke Rudolf — whence its name. It is one of his brightest,
clearest, cleanest works, least confused by profusion, almost statuesque
in its organic form. His last appearance as a performer was at the piano
in a presentation of this classic in April, 1814. He was now so deaf
that he had lost the proper ad- justment of hand and pedal pressure to
musical intent; some of the fortissimi drowned out the strings, while
some pianissimi were inaudible.</p>
<p>In May, 1812, while Napoleon was massing half a million men for death
in Russia, Beethoven issued his Seventh Symphony, which, less often per-
formed, seems now to wear better than the Fifth or the Sixth. Here is a
somber dirge for lost greatness and shattered hopes, and here, too, is
tender- ness for fading but cherished loves, and a quest for
understanding and peace. As its funeral march was an unwitting “1812
overture” to Napoleon’s disas - ter in Moscow, so its premiere, on
December 8, 1813, was contemporary with the collapse of Napoleon’s power
in Germany and Spain. The enthusi - astic reception of this symphony
gladdened for a time the aging pessimist, who continued to produce
masterpieces that for him had to be like those on Keats’s Grecian urn,
“ditties of no tone.”</p>
<p>The Eighth Symphony, written in October, 1812, first performed on</p>
<p>February 27, 1814, was not so well received; the master had relaxed,
and had decided to be playful; it did not quite accord with the mood of
a nation watching its fate daily hanging on the fortunes of war. But now
we may de- light in the jolly, prancing scherzando, whose persistent
punctuation ap- parently made fun of a recent invention, the
metronome.</p>
<p>The most successful of Beethoven’s compositions was “Die Schlacht von
Vittoria,” offered in Vienna on December 8, 1813, to celebrate the
battle in which Wellington had definitely destroyed French power in
Spain. The news brought tardy satisfaction to the Austrian capital,
which had been re- peatedly humiliated by the apparently invincible
Corsican. Now for the first time Beethoven became really famous in his
adopted city. The music, we are told, hardly deserved its triumph; die
Schlacht war schlecht. Its sub- ject and success made Beethoven popular
with the dignitaries who, in 1814, attended the Congress of Vienna. The
composer forgivably took the op- portunity to organize a benefit concert
for himself; the imperial court, resplendent with victory, offered him
the use of its spacious Redoutensaal; Beethoven sent personal
invitations to the notables of the Congress; six thou- sand persons
attended; and Beethoven was enabled to hide a substantial sum to cushion
his future and his nephew’s.</p>
<p>On November 11, 1815, his brother Karl died, after bequeathing a
small</p>
<p>582</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>sum to Ludwig, and appointing him co-guardian, with the widow, of an
eight-year-old son, Karl. From 1815 to 1826 Beethoven carried on, in
letters and the courts, a searing contest with widow Theresia for
control of Karl’s movements, education, and soul. Theresia had brought
Karl Senior a dowry and a house, but had lapsed into adultery; she
confessed to her hus- band, who forgave her. Beethoven never forgave
her, and considered her unfit to guide Karl’s development. We shall not
follow that quarrel in its wearing length and sordid details. In 1826
Karl, torn between mother and uncle, tried to kill himself. Beethoven
finally acknowledged the failure of his loving rigor. Karl recovered,
joined the Army, and took care of himself reasonably well.</p>
<p>With the year 1817 Beethoven passed into the final period of his
creative life. Long a revolutionist in private politics, he now made
open war against classic norms, welcomed the Romantic movement into
music, and gave to the sonata and the symphony a looser structure that
subordinated the old rules to a rampant freedom of emotional and
personal expression. Something of the wild spirit that had spoken in
France through Rousseau and the Revo- lution, in Germany through Sturm
und Drang, in young Goethe’s Werthers Leiden and young Schiller’s Die
Rauber, then in the poems of Tieck and Novalis, in the prose of the
Schlegels, in the philosophies of Fichte and Schelling — something of
all this came down to Beethoven, and found rich soil in his natural
emotionalism and individualistic pride. An old system of law,
convention, and restraint collapsed in art as in politics, leaving the
reso- lute individual free to express or embody his feelings and desires
in a joy- ful bursting of old rules, bonds, and forms. Beethoven mocked
the masses as asses, the nobles as impostors, their conventions and
courtesies as irrelevant to artistic creation; he refused to be
imprisoned in molds fashioned by the dead, even by such melodious dead
as Bach and Handel, Haydn and Mozart and Gluck. He made his own
revolution, even his own Terror, and made his “Ode to Joy” a declaration
of independence even in expectation of death.</p>
<p>The three Hammerklavier Sonatas formed a bridge between the second
period and the third. Even their name was a revolt. Some angry Teutons,
tired of Italian domination in the language and income of music, had
pro- posed using German, instead of Italian, words for musical notations
and instruments. So the majestic pianoforte should discard that Italian
word for low and strong , and be called Hammerklavier, since the tones
were produced by little hammers striking strings. Beethoven readily
accepted the idea, and wrote Sigmund Steiner, manufacturer of musical
instruments, on January 1 3, 1817: “Instead of Pianoforte,
Hammerklavier— which settles the matter once for all.” 42</p>
<p>The most remarkable of the Hammerklavier Sonatas is the second, Opus
106 in B Flat, written in 1818- 19 as a “Grosse Sonata fur das Hammer -
klavier.” Beethoven told Czerny that it was to remain his greatest piece
for the piano, and this judgment has been confirmed by pianists in every

<p>ceeding generation. It seems to express a somber resignation to old
age, ill- ness, and a darkening solitude, and yet it is a triumph of art
over despair.</p>
<p>It was in further rejection of such despondency that Beethoven wrote
the Ninth Symphony. He began work on it in 1 8 1 8, concurrently with
the Missa solemnis which was to be performed at the installation of
Archduke Rudolf as archbishop of Olmiitz. The Mass was finished first,
in 1823, three years too late for the installation.</p>
<p>Anxious to add to the little hoard that he had accumulated as a
refuge against old age and as a bequest to nephew Karl, Beethoven
conceived the notion of selling subscriptions for pre-publication copies
of his Mass. He sent invitations to this effect to the sovereigns of
Europe, asking from each of them fifty ducats in gold. 43 Acceptances
came in slowly, but by 1825 ten had come: from the rulers of Russia,
Prussia, France, Saxony, Tuscany, the Princes Golitsyn and Radziwill,
and the Caecilia Association of Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The Missa solemnis is generally held to have justified its long
gestation and the strange bartering of its finished form. There is no
trace in it of the occasional blasphemies that interrupted his inherited
Catholic faith. Each moment of the liturgy is interpreted with
concordant music, and through it all is audible the dying man’s
desperate faith, written by him in th e manu- script score at the outset
of the Credo: “God above all— God has never deserted me.” 44 The music
is too powerful to be an expression of Christian humility; but the
dedicated concentration on each part and phrase, and the sustained
majesty of the whole, make the Missa solemnis the fit and final offering
of a great flawed spirit to an incomprehensible God.</p>
<p>In February, 1824, he completed the Ninth Symphony. Here his struggle
to express his final philosophy — the joyful acceptance of man’s fate—
broke through all the trammels of classic order, and the impetuous
monarch let the pride of his power carry him to massive exultations that
sacrificed the old god order to the young god liberty. In the profusion
of shattered altars the themes that should have stood out as pillars to
the edifice disappeared from all but esoteric view; the phrases seemed
unduly insistent and repeated; an occasional moment of tenderness or
calm was overwhelmed by a sudden fortissimo flung as if in rage at a mad
and unresponsive world. Not so, a great scholar replies; there is, in
this apparent embarrassment of riches, “an extreme simplicity of form,
underlying an elaboration of detail which may at first seem bewildering
until we realize that it is purely the working out, to its logical
conclusions, of some ideas as simple and natural as the form itself.”
46</p>
<p>Perhaps the master deliberately abandoned the classic effort to give
lasting form to mortal beauty or veiled significance. He confessed his
surrender, and frolicked in the unregulated wealth of his imagination
and the lavished resources of his art. In the end he recaptured some
flair of youthful defiance, and enshrined in music that ode of
Schiller’s which was not really to mere</p>

<p>With his culminating masterpieces now complete, Beethoven longed for
an opportunity to present them to the public. But Rossini had so
captivated Austria in 1823, and Viennese audiences were now so enamored
of Italian melody, that no local impresario dared risk a fortune on two
compositions so difficult as the Missa solemnis and the Choral Symphony.
A Berlin pro- ducer offered to present them; Beethoven was about to
agree, when a com- bination of music lovers, led by the Lichnowsky
family, alarmed at the thought of Vienna’s outstanding composer being
forced to go to a rival capital for the premiere of his latest and most
prestigious works, agreed to underwrite their production at the
Karntnerthor Theater. After hard bar- gaining on all sides the concert
was given on May 7, 1824, before a crowded house, and with a stoic
program: an overture (“The Consecration of the House”), four parts of
the Missa solemnis , and the Ninth Symphony with a stentorian German
chorus to crown it all. The singers, unable to reach the high notes
prescribed, omitted them. 46 The Mass was received solemnly, the
symphony with enthusiastic acclaim. Beethoven, who had been standing on
the platform with his back to the audience, did not hear the applause,
and had to be turned around to see it. 47</p>

<p>He quarreled with Schindler and other friends about the small share
(420 florins) they gave him of the 2,200 taken at the concert; he
charged them with cheating him; they left him solitary now except for
the occa- sional presence of his nephew, whose attempt at suicide (1826)
topped the inspired bear’s cup of grief. It was in those years that he
wrote the last five of his sixteen quartets.</p>
<p>The spark for these labors had come in 1823 from the offer of Prince
Nikolai Golitsyn to pay “any sum demanded” for orte, two, or three quar
- tets to be dedicated to him. Beethoven agreed, for fifty ducats each.
Those three (Opp. 127, 130, and 132), and Opp. 13 1 and 135, constitute
the terminal quartets whose mysterious strangeness has ensured their
fame. Opus 130 was privately played in 1826, to the avowed delight of
the listeners, except that the performers found the fourth movement
beyond their pow- ers; Beethoven wrote a simpler finale. The rejected
movement is now offered as “Grosse Fugue,” Opus 133, which a Beethoven
scholar bravely interprets as expressing the composer’s final
philosophy: Life and reality are composed of inseparable opposites —
good and evil, joy and sorrow, health and sickness, birth and death; and
wisdom will adjust itself to them as the inescapable essence of life.
Most highly praised of the five, and con- sidered by Beethoven to be his
greatest quartet, is Opus 131 in C Sharp</p>

<p>585</p>
<p>Minor, finished on August 7, 1826; here, we are told, “the mystical
vision is most perfectly sustained.” 48 Heard again recently, it seemed
to be a long weird wail, the pitiful moaning of a mortally wounded
animal. The last of the five, Opus 135, states a motto for its final
movement: Muss es sein? (Must it be? ) , and gives the answer: Es muss
sein.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1826, racked by a tearing cough, Beethoven asked for a
doctor. Two of his former physicians refused to come. 49 A third,
Dr. Wawruch, came, and diagnosed pneumonia. Beethoven took to his bed.
His brother Johann came to watch over him. Nephew Karl, with Bee-
thoven’s blessing, left at the call of the Army. On January 1 1
Dr. Wawruch was joined by Dr. Malfatti. He prescribed frozen punch to
help the patient sleep; Beethoven relished the liquor in it, and “abused
the prescription.” 50 Dropsy and jaundice developed; urine collected in
Beeth oven’s body instead of being excreted; twice he was tapped to
release the fluid; he compared himself to a geyser.</p>
<p>Resolved to make no use of the bank shares — totaling ten thousand
florins — which he had hidden for Karl, and faced by rapidly rising
expenses, Beethoven wrote, on March 6, 1827, to Sir George Smart of
London:</p>
<p>What is to become of me? What am I to live on until I have recovered
my lost strength and can again earn my living by means of my pen?… I beg
you to exert all your influence to induce the Philharmonic Society to
carry out their former decision to give a concert for my benefit. My
strength is not equal to saying anything more. 51</p>
<p>The Society sent him a hundred pounds as an advance on the receipts
of the proposed concert.</p>
<p>By March 16 the physicians agreed that Beethoven had not long to
live. They and brother Johann asked his consent to summoning a priest.
“I wish it,” he answered. His occasional bouts with God had been
forgotten; his let ter of March 14 shows him ready to accept whatever
“God in His divine wisdom” might decree. 52 On March 23 he received the
last sacrament, ap - parently in a docile mood; his brother later
reported that the dying man had said to him, “I thank you for this last
service.” 53 Soon after the cere - mony Beethoven said to Schindler, “
Comoedia finita est ”— referring appar- ently not to the religious
service but to life itself; 54 the phrase was used in the classic Roman
theater to announce the end of the play.</p>
<p>He died on March 26, 1827, after three months of suffering. A few mo-
ments before his death a flash of lightning illuminated the room,
followed by a sharp clap of thunder. Aroused, Beethoven raised his right
arm and shook his clenched fist, apparently at the storm. Soon
thereafter his agony ended. We shall never know what that last gesture
meant.</p>
<p>The post-mortem examination revealed the complex of internal
disorders that had darkened his life and his temper. The liver was
shrunken and dis- eased. The arteries of the ears were clogged with
fatty particles, and the auditory nerves were degenerated. “The pains in
the head, indigestion, colic, and jaundice, of which he frequently
complained, and the deep de-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>pression which gives the key to so many of his letters, would all
follow naturally from the chronic inflammation of the liver and the
digestive de- rangements to which it would give rise.” 65 Probably his
love of walking and the open air had moderated these ailments, and had
given him most of the painless hours in his life.</p>
<p>His funeral was attended by thirty thousand persons. Hummel the
pianist and Kreutzer the violinist were among the pallbearers; Schubert,
Czerny, and Grillparzer were among the torchbearers. The tombstone bore
only the name Beethoven and his dates of birth and death.</p>
