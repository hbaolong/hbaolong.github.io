<p>XXThe Moral Release</p>
<p>1300-1534</p>
<p>V. THE FOUNTS AND FORMS OF IMMORALITY</p>
<p>N OWHERE are the prejudices of the historian so likely to mislead</p>
<p>him as when he seeks to determine the moral level of an age — unless
it be in the kindred inquiry into the decline of religious belief. In
either case the dramatic exception will strike his eye and turn it from
the unrecorded average. His vision will be further blurred if he
approaches the problem with a thesis to prove — as, for example, that
religious doubt brings moral decay. And the records themselves are
ambivalent, capable, according to the selective bias, of proving almost
anything. The works of Aretino, the autobiography of Cellini, the
correspondence of Machiavelli and Vettori can be stressed to convey the
odor of disintegration; the letters of Isabella and Beatrice d’Este, of
Elisabetta Gonzaga and Alessandra Strozzi can be quoted to paint a
picture of sisterly tenderness and ideal family life. The reader will
have to be on his guard.</p>
<p>Many factors entered into the moral decline that accompanied the
intel- lectual exaltation of the Renaissance. Probably the basic factor
was the growth of wealth that resulted from Italy’s s trategic position
on the routes of trade between western Europe and the East, and from the
flow of tithes and annates out of a thousand Christian communities into
Rome. Sin be- came more prevalent as more funds were provided to meet
its costs. The spread of wealth weakened the ascetic ideal: men and
women came to re- sent an ethic that had been born of poverty and fear,
and that now ran counter to both their impulses and their means. They
heard with rising sympathy the view of Epicurus that life should be
enjoyed, and that all pleasures are to be accounted innocent until
proved guilty. The charms of woman triumphed over the prohibitions of
theology.</p>
<p>Perhaps next to wealth the main source of immorality was the
political unsettlement of the times. The strife of factions, the
frequency of war, the influx of foreign mercenaries, and, later, the
invasion of Italy by foreign armies recognizing no moral restraints on
Italian soil, the repeated dis-</p>
<p>568</p>
<p>CHAP, xx) THE MORAL RELEASE 569</p>
<p>ruption of agriculture and trade by the ravages of war, the
destruction of freedom by despots who replaced peaceful legitimacy with
autocratic force: all these disordered Italian life, and cracked the
“cake of custom” that normally conserves morality. Men found themselves
unmoored in a sea of violence. Neither state nor Church seemed able to
protect them; they protected themselves as best they could, by arms or
craft; lawlessness became the law. The despots, placed above the law and
dedicated to a short but stirring life, indulged themselves in every
pleasure; and their ex- ample was followed by the moneyed minority.</p>
<p>In assessing the role of religious unbelief in releasing the natural
im- morality of mankind, we must begin by distinguishing the skepticism
of the lettered few from the persistent piety of the many. Enlightenment
is of minorities, and emancipation is individual; minds are not freed en
masse. A few skeptics might protest against false relics and bogus
miracles and indulgences offering promissory notes for cash; but the
people accepted them with awe and hope. In 1462 the scholar-Pope Pius II
and some cardi- nals went out to the Milvian Bridge to meet the head of
the Apostle An- drew, which was arriving from Greece; and the
scholar-Cardinal Bessarion pronounced a solemn oration when the precious
figment was deposited in St. Peter’s. The people undertook pilgrimages
to Loreto and Assisi, flocked to Rome in jubilee years, made the
stations of the cross from church to church, and mounted on their knees
the Scala Santa which, they were told, was the very stairway that Christ
had climbed to the tribune of Pilate. Powerful characters might laugh at
all this while their health was good, but rare was the Renaissance
Italian who did not ask for the sacraments on his deathbed. Vitellozzo
Vitelli, the rough condottiere who had fought Alex- ander VI and Caesar
Borgia, begged a messenger to go to Rome and seek papal absolution for
him before Caesar’s handy man tightened the noose around his neck. Women
especially worshiped Mary; almost every village had a miracle-working
icon of her; now ( c . 1524) the Rosary became a favorite form of
prayer. Every decent house had a crucifix and a holy pic- ture or two;
and before one or more of these, in many homes, a lamp was kept burning
endlessly. Village squares and city streets might be adorned with a
statue of Jesus or the Virgin, placed in a separate tabernacle or a
niche in a wall. The festivals of the religious calendar were celebrated
with a pomp and magnificence that gave the people thrilling
interruptions to their toil; and every decade or so the coronation of a
pope offered proces- sions and games that to antiquarians recalled the
spectacles of ancient Rome. Never was a religion more beautiful than
when the artists of the Renais-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXsance housed and carved its shrines, and painted its heroes and
legends, and drama, music, poetry, and incense joined in the colorful,
odorous, sumptu- ous worship of God.</p>
<p>But this, again, is but one side of a scene too diverse and
contradictory to be briefly described. In the cities many of the
churches were left relatively empty of men then as now. 1 As to the
countryside hear Archbishop An- tonino of Florence describing the
peasants of his diocese about 1430:</p>
<p>In the churches themselves they sometimes dance and leap and</p>
<p>sing with women. On holydays they spend little time on divine serv-
ice or hearing the whole Mass, but most in games or taverns or con-
tentions at the church doors. They blaspheme God and His saints</p>
<p>on slender provocation. They are filled with lies and perjuries;
they</p>
<p>make no conscience of fornication, and of worse sins still. Very</p>
<p>many of them do not confess even once a year; far fewer are those</p>
<p>who take Communion. . . . They do little to instruct their
families</p>
<p>in the manner of faithful folk. They use enchantments for them-</p>
<p>selves and their beasts. Of God, or their own souls’ health, they</p>
<p>think not at all. . . . Their parish priests, caring not for the
flock</p>
<p>committed to them, but only for its wool and milk, do not
instruct</p>
<p>them through preaching and the confessional, or by private admoni-
tions, but walk in the same error as their flocks, following their
cor-</p>
<p>rupt ways . 2</p>
<p>We may reasonably conclude, from the existence and natural deaths of
such men as Pomponazzi and Machiavelli, that a large section of the edu-
cated classes in the Italy of 1500 had lost faith in Catholic
Christianity; and we may more precariously assume that even among the
letterless religion had lost some of its power to control the moral
life. An increasing pro- portion of the population had ceased to believe
in the divine origin of the moral code. Once the Commandments appeared
to be man-made, and were shorn of their supernatural sanctions in heaven
and hell, the code lost its terrors and its efflcacy. Tabus fell away,
and a calculus of expediency took their place. The sense of sin, the
gloom of guilt, waned; conscience was left comparatively free; and each
man did what seemed to him convenient, even if not traditionally right.
Men no longer wished to be good, but to be strong; many private
individuals took to themselves, long before Machia- velli, those
privileges of force and fraud — that principle of the end justify- ing
the means — which he conceded to the rulers of states; perhaps his ethic
was an after-image of the morals he had seen around him. Platina
attributed to Pius II the remark that “even if the Christian faith had
not been con -</p>
<p>THE MORAL RELEASE</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>5 7 1</p>
<p>firmed by miracles, it ought to be received because of its morality
.” 3 But men did not reason so philosophically. They said, simply: If
there is no hell or heaven, we must enjoy ourselves here, and we may
indulge our appetites without fear of punishment after death. Only a
strong and intel- ligent public opinion could have taken the place of
the lost supernatural sanctions; but neither the clergy nor the
humanists nor the universities rose to this task.</p>
<p>The humanists were as morally corrupt as the clergy they
criticized.</p>
<p>There were shining exceptions, scholars who found decency compatible
with intellectual liberation — Ambrogio Traversari, Vittorino da Feltre,
Marsilio Ficino, Aldus Manutius. . . . But an impressively large
minority of the men who resurrected Greek and Roman literature lived
like pagans who had never heard of Christianity. Their mobility
deracinated them; they passed from city to city seeking laurels and
fees, and sank no roots in stability. They were as fond of money as any
moneylender or his wife. They were vain of their genius, their income,
their features, their dress. They were coarse in their speech,
ungenerous and disgraceful in their con- troversies, faithless in their
friendships and transient in their loves. Ariosto, as we have noted,
dared not trust his son to a humanist tutor for fear of moral
contamination; probably he found it unnecessary to forbid the boy to
read Orlando furioso, which was salted with melodious obscenity. Valla,
Poggio, Beccadelli, Filelfo summarized in their loose lives one of the
basic problems of ethics and civilization: must a moral code, to
function effec- tively, have supernatural sanctions — the belief in
another life, or in the divine origin of the moral code?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MORALS OF THE CLERGY</li>
</ol>
<p>The Church might have sustained the supernatural sanctions provided
by the Hebraic Scriptures and the Christian tradition, if her personnel
had led lives of decency and devotion. But most of them accepted the bad
as well as the good in the morals of the time, and reflected the
antithetical facets of the laity. The parish priest was a simple
ministrant, usually of slight education, but normally (pace the good
Antonino) leading an exemplary life ; 4 ignored by the intelligentsia
but welcomed by the people. Among the bishops and abbots there were some
high livers, but many good men; and perhaps half the college of
cardinals maintained a pious and Christian con- duct that shamed the gay
worldliness of their colleagues . 5 All over Italy there were hospitals,
orphan asylums, schools, almshouses, monti di pietd</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>57 *</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XX(loan offices), and other charitable institutions managed by the
clergy. The Benedictine, Observantine, and Carthusian monks were honored
for the relatively high moral level of their lives. Missionaries faced a
thousand dangers to spread the faith in “heathen” lands and among the
pagans of Christendom. Mystics hid themselves away from the violence of
the times, and sought closer communion with God.</p>
<p>Amid this devotion there was so much laxity of morals among the
clergy that a thousand testimonies could be adduced to prove it. The
same Pe- trarch who remained faithful to Christianity to the end, and
who drew a favorable picture of discipline and piety in the Carthusian
monastery where his brother lived, repeatedly denounced the morals of
the clergy in Avi- gnon. From the novelle of Boccaccio in the fourteenth
century, through those of Masuccio in the fifteenth, to those of
Bandello in the sixteenth, the loose lives of the Italian clergy form a
recurrent theme of Italian literature. Boccaccio speaks of “the lewd and
filthy life of the clergy,” in sins “natural or sodomitical .” 6
Masuccio described the monks and friars as “ministers of Satan,”
addicted to fornication, homosexualism, avarice, simony, and im - piety,
and professed to have found a higher moral level in the army than in the
clergy . 7 Aretino, familiar with all filth, railed at the errors of
printers as rivaling in number the sins of the clergy; “truly it would
be easier to find Rome sober and chaste than a correct book .” 8 Poggio
almost exhausts his vocabulary of vituperation in exposing the
immorality, hypocrisy, cupidity, ig norance, and arrogance of monks and
priests ; 9 and Folengo’s Orlandino tells the same tale. Apparently the
nuns, who today are angels and ministers of grace, shared in the
revelry. They were especially lively in Venice, where monasteries and
nunneries were sufficiently close to each other to allow their inmates,
now and then, to share a bed; the archives of the Proveditori sopra
monasteri contain twenty volumes of trials for the cohabi- tation of
monks and nuns . 10 Aretino speaks unquotably about the nuns of Venice .
11 And Guicciardini, usually temperate, loses his poise in describing
Rome: “Of the Court of Rome it is impossible to speak with sufficient
severity, for it is a standing infamy, an example of all that is most
vile and shameful in th e world .” 12</p>
<p>These testimonies seem exaggerated, and may be prejudiced. But hear
St. Catherine of Siena:</p>
<p>On whatever side you turn — whether to the secular clergy of</p>
<p>priests and bishops, or to the religious orders, or to prelates small
or great, old or young, . . . you see nothing but offenses; and all
stink</p>
<p>in my nostrils with a stench of mortal sin. Narrow, greedy, and

<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>ricious . . . they have abandoned the care of souls. . . . Making a
god of their belly, eating and drinking in disorderly feast, they fall
thence forthwith into filth, living in lasciviousness . . . feeding
their children with the substance of the poor. . . . They flee from
choir service</p>
<p>as from poison. 18</p>
<p>Here again we must discount something, since no saint can be trusted
to speak of human conduct without indignation. But we may accept the
sum- ming up of a candid Catholic historian:</p>
<p>It is not surprising, when the highest ranks of the clergy were
in</p>
<p>such a state, that among the regular orders and secular priests
vice</p>
<p>and irregularities of all sorts should have become more and more</p>
<p>common. The salt of the earth had lost its savor. … It was such</p>
<p>priests as these that gave occasion to the more or less
exaggerated</p>
<p>descriptions of the clergy by Erasmus and Luther, who visited Rome
during the reign of Julius II. But it is a mistake to suppose that
the</p>
<p>corruption of the clergy was worse in Rome than elsewhere; there</p>
<p>is documentary evidence of the immorality of the priests in
almost</p>
<p>every town in the Italian peninsula. In many places — Venice, for</p>
<p>instance — matters were far worse than in Rome. No wonder, as</p>
<p>contemporary writers sadly testify, the influence of the clergy
had</p>
<p>declined, and that in many places hardly any respect was shown for
the priesthood. Their immorality was so gross that suggestions in</p>
<p>favor of allowing priests to marry began to be heard. . . . Many
of</p>
<p>the monasteries were in a deplorable condition. The three essential
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience were in some convents</p>
<p>almost entirely disregarded. . . . The discipline of many convents
of</p>
<p>nuns was equally lax. 14</p>
<p>Less forgivable than irregularities of sex and festivities of diet
were the activities of the Inquisition. But these remarkably declined in
Italy during the fifteenth century. In 1440 Amadeo de’ Landi, a
mathematician, was tried on a charge of materialism, but was acquitted.
In 1478 Galeotto Marcio was condemned to death for writing that any man
who lived a good life would go to heaven whatever his religion might be;
but Pope Sixtus IV saved him. 16 In 1497 the physician Gabriele da Said
was pro- tected from the Inquisition by his patients, though he
maintained that Christ was not God, but was the son of Joseph and Mary,
conceived in the usual ridiculous way; that Christ’s body was not in the
consecrated wafer; and that His miracles had been performed not by
divine power but through the influence of the stars; 17 so one myth
drives out another. In 1500 Gior-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXgio da Novara was burnt to death at Bologna, apparently for denying
the divinity of Christ without having influential friends. In the same
year the bishop of Aranda declared with impunity that there is neither
heaven nor hell, and that indulgences were merely a means of raising
funds. 18 In 1510, when Ferdinand the Catholic tried to introduce the
Inquisition into Naples, he met with such determined resistance from all
classes of the population that he had to abandon the attempt. 1 *</p>
<p>Amid the ecclesiastical decay there were several centers of wholesome
reform. Pius II deposed a general of the Dominicans, and disciplined lax
monasteries in Venice, Brescia, Florence, and Siena. In 1517 Sadoleto,
Giberti, Caraffa, and other churchmen founded the Oratory of the Divine
Love as a center for pious men who desired some refuge from the pagan
worldliness of Rome. In 1523 Caraffa organized the order of Theatines,
in which secular priests lived under monastic rules of chastity,
obedience, and poverty. Cardinal Caraffa resigned all his benefices and
distributed his property among the poor; so did Saint Gaetano, another
founder of the Theatines. These devotees, many of them men of noble
lineage and great wealth, astonished Rome by strict adherence to their
self-imposed rules, and their fearless visits to victims of the plague.
In 1533 Antonio Maria Zaccaria established at Milan a similar community
of priests, first called the Regular Clerics of St. Paul, but soon to be
known as Barnabites from the church of St. Barnabas. Caraffa drew up a
helpful program of reform for the clergy of Venice, and Giberti essayed
similar reforms in the diocese of Verona (1528-31). Egidio Canisio
reformed the Augustinian eremites, and Gregorio Cortese effected a
similar betterment among the Benedictines at Padua.</p>
<p>The outstanding effort at monastic reform in this age was the
foundation of the Capuchin Order. Matteo di Bassi, a friar of the
Franciscan Observ- antines at Montefalcone, thought that he saw
St. Francis in a vision, and that he heard him say: “I wish my rule to
be observed to the letter, to the</p>
<p>THE MORAL RELEASE</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>self-reform that came to the monastic and mendicant orders in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 20</p>
<p>Some of these reforms were undertaken in response to the Protestant
Ref- ormation. Many of them were of spontaneous generation, and
indicated a saving vitality in Christianity and the Church.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>SEXUAL MORALITY</li>
</ol>
<p>Turning now to laic morals, and beginning with the relations of
the</p>
<p>sexes, we should remind ourselves at the outset that man is by nature
polyg- amous, and that only the strongest moral sanctions, a helpful
degree of poverty and hard work, and uninterrupted wifely supervision,
can induce him to monogamy. It is not clear that adultery was less
popular in the Mid- dle Ages than in the Renaissance. And as medieval
adultery was tempered with chivalry, so in the Renaissance it was
softened, in the lettered classes, by an idealization of the refinement
and spiritual charms of the educated woman. Greater equality of the
sexes in education and social standing made possible a new intellectual
comradeship between men and women. In Mantua, Milan, Urbino, Ferrara,
and Naples life was graced and stirred by the prominence of attractive
and cultivated women.</p>
<p>Girls of good family were kept in relative seclusion from men not of
their own household. They were sedulously instructed in the advantages
of premarital chastity; sometimes with such success that we hear of a
young woman drowning herself after being raped. She was doubtless
exceptional, for a bishop proposed to raise a statue to her. 21 In the
Roman catacombs a young gentlewoman strangled herself to avoid
seduction; her body was borne in triumph through the streets of Rome,
with a laurel crown on her head. 22 Nevertheless there must have been
considerable premarital adven- ture; otherwise it would be difficult to
account for the extraordinary num- ber of bastards to be found in any
city of Renaissance Italy. Not to have bastards was a distinction; to
have them was no serious disgrace; the man, on marrying, usually
persuaded his wife to let his illegitimate progeny join the household
and be brought up with her own children. To be a bastard was no great
disability; the social stigma involved was almost negligible;
legitimation could be obtained by lubricating an ecclesiastical hand. In
de- fault of legitimate and competent heirs bastard sons could succeed
to an estate, even to a throne, as Ferrante I succeeded Alfonso I at
Naples, and as Leonello d’Este succeeded Niccolo III at Ferrara. When
Pius II came to Ferrara in 1459 he was received by seven princes, all
illegitimate. 23 The</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXrivalry of bastards with legitimate sons was a rich source of
Renaissance violence. Half the novelle turn on seductions; and usually
such stories were read or heard by women with only a momentary lowering
of the eyes. Robert, Bishop of Aquino, toward the close of the fifteenth
century, described the morals of the young men in his diocese as
unashamedly cor- rupt; they explained to him, he tells us, that
fornication was no sin, that chastity was an old-fashioned tabu, and
that virginity was on the wane. 24 Even incest had its devotees.</p>
<p>As for homosexuality, it became almost an obligatory part of the
Greek revival. The humanists wrote about it with a kind of scholarly
affection, and Ariosto judged that they were all addicted to it.
Politian, Filippo Strozzi, and the diarist Sanudo were reasonably
suspected of it; 25 Michel- angelo, Julius II, and Clement VII were less
convincingly charged with it; San Bernardino found so much of it in
Naples that he threatened the city with the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah.
26 Aretino described the aberration as quite popular in Rome, 27 and he
himself, between one mistress and an- other, asked the duke of Mantua to
send him an attractive boy. 28 In 1455 the Venetian Council of Ten took
official note “how the abominable vice of sodomy multiplies in this
city”; and “to avert the wrath of God,” it ap - pointed two men in each
quarter of Venice to put down the practice. 29 The Council noted that
some men had taken to wearing feminine garb, and that some women were
adopting male attire, and it called this “a species of sodomy.” 30 In
1492 a noble and a p riest, convicted of homosexual acts, were beheaded
in the Piazzetta, and their bodies were publicly burned. 31 These, of
course, were exceptional cases, from which we must not gen- eralize; but
we may assume that homosexuality was more than normally present in
Renaissance Italy until the Counter Reformation.</p>
<p>We may say likewise of prostitution. According to Infessura — who
liked to load his statistics against papal Rome — there were 6,800
registered prosti- tutes in Rome in 1490, not counting clandestine
practitioners, in a popula- tion of some 90,ooo. 32 In Venice the census
of 1509 reported 1 1,654 prosti- tutes in a population of some 3oo,ooo.
33 An enterprising printer published a “Catalogue of all the principal
and most honored courtesans of Ve nice, their names, addresses, and
fees.” 34 On the roads they frequented taverns; in the cities they were
the favorite guests of young blades and fervent artists. Cellini
recounts his night’s lodging with a courtesan as an incident of no
moment, and describes a dinner of artists, including Giulio Romano and
himself, in which each man was required to bring a woman of low
resistance. At a higher level the banker Lorenzo Strozzi gave a banquet

<p>1519 to fourteen persons, including four cardinals and three women of
the demimonde. 36</p>
<p>As wealth and refinement increased, a demand arose for courtesans
with some education and social charm; and as in the Athens of Sophocles
hetaerae rose to meet this demand, so in the Rome of the late fifteen
century, and in the Venice of the sixteenth, a class of cortigiane
oneste — genteel courtesans — developed, who rivaled the finest ladies
in dress, manners, culture, even in hebdomadal piety. While the simpler
prostitutes — cortigiane di candela — practised in brothels, these Roman
hetaerae lived in their own homes, en- tertained lavishly, read and
wrote poetry, sang and played music, and joined in educated
conversation; some collected pictures and statuary, rare editions and
the latest books; some maintained literary salons. To keep up with the
humanists many of them took classical names — Camilla, Polyxena,
Penthesilea, Faustina, Imperia, Tullia. One scandalous wit, in the
pontifi- cate of Alexander VI, wrote a series of epigrams beginning with
a number in praise of the Virgin or the saints, and then, without a
blush, continuing with several in honor of the distinguished courtesans
of his time. 36 When one such, Faustina Mancina, died, half of Rome
mourned her, and Michel- angelo was one of many who wrote sonnets to her
memory. 37</p>
<p>The most renowned of these cortigiane oneste was Imperia de Cugnatis.
Made rich by her patron Agostino Chigi, she adorned her home with
luxurious furniture and choice art, and gathered about her a bevy of
scholars, artists, poets, and churchmen; even the pious Sadoleto sang
her praise. 33 Probably it was Imperia whom Raphael took as his model
for the Sappho of his Parnassus. She died in the flower of her beauty at
the age of twenty-six ( 1 5 1 1 ) , ’and received honorable burial in
the church of San Gregorio, with a marble tomb engraved in the finest
lapidary style; and half a hundred poets lamented her in classic
elegies. 39 (Her daughter killed herself rather than submit to
seduction. 40 ) Almost as renowned was Tullia d’Aragona, illegitimate
daughter of the Cardinal of Aragon. Admired for her golden hair and
sparkling eyes, her generosity and carelessness with money, her grace of
carriage and charm of conversation, she was received in Naples, Rome,
Florence, and Ferrara like a visiting princess. The</p>
<p>Mantuan ambassador at Ferrara described her entry in an undiplomatic
letter to Isabella d’Este (1537):</p>
<p>I have to record the arrival among us of a gentle lady, so modest</p>
<p>in behavior, so fascinating in manners, that we cannot help consider-
ing her something divine. She sings impromptu all kinds of airs and</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmotets. . . . There is not one lady in Ferrara, not even
Vittoria</p>
<p>Colonna the Duchess of Pescara, who can stand comparison with</p>
<p>Tullia. 41</p>
<p>Moretto da Brescia painted a bewitching portrait of her, looking as
innocent as a novice nun. She made the mistake of outliving her charms;
she died in a wretched hut near the Tiber; and her total belongings, at
auction, brought a dozen crowns (50?). But in all her poverty she had
kept her lute and harpsichord to the last. She left also a book that she
had composed On the Infinity of Perfect Love . 42</p>
<p>Doubtless that title reflected the Renaissance fashion of talking and
writing about Platonic love. If a woman could not commit adultery she
might at least allow herself to arouse in a man a kind of poetic
gallantry that made her the object of verses, courtesies, and
dedications. The de- votion s of the troubadours, the Vita Nuova of
Dante, and Plato’s dis - courses on spiritual love had begotten in a few
circles a fine sentiment of adoration toward woman — usually another
man’s wife. Most people paid no attention to the idea, preferring their
love in a frankly sensual form; they might write sonnets, but their goal
was coitus; and hardly once in a hundred cases, despite the novelists,
did they marry the object of their love.</p>
<p>For marriage was an affair of property, and property could not be
made dependent upon the passing whims of physical desire. Betrothals
were ar- ranged by family councils, and most young people accepted
without ef- fectual protest the mates so assigned to them. Girls could
be betrothed at the age of three, though marriage had to be delayed till
twelve. In the fifteenth century a daughter unmarried at fifteen was a
family disgrace; in the sixteenth century the age of disgrace was
deferred to seventeen, to allow time for higher education. 43 Men, who
enjoyed all the privileges and facilities of promiscuity, could be lured
into marriage only by brides bring- ing substantial dowries. In
Savonarola’s day there were many marriageable</p>

<p>Weddings themselves consumed enormous sums; Leonardo Bruni com-
plained that his matrimonium had squandered his patrimonium . 48 Kings
and queens, princes and princesses spent half a million dollars on a
wedding while famine raged among the people.* 7 When Alfonso the
Magnificent of Naples married, he set up tables for 30,000 diners on the
shores of the Bay. Lovelier was the reception that Urbino gave to Duke
Guidobaldo when he brought from Mantua his bride Elisabetta Gonzaga:
ranged on a hill slope stood the ladies of the city, beautifully
dressed; before them their children carried olive branches; mounted
choristers, in graceful formation, sang a cantata that had been composed
for the occasion; and an especially comely matron, impersonating a
goddess, offered the new Duchess the loyalty and affection of the
people. 48</p>
<p>After marriage the woman usually kept her own name; so Lorenzo ’s
wife continued to be called Donna Clarice Orsini; sometimes, however,
the wife might add her husband’s name to her own— Maria Salviati de’
Medici. In the medieval theory of marriage it was expected that love
would develop between man and wife through the varied partnerships of
marriage in joy and sorrow, prosperity and adversity; and apparently the
expectation was fulfilled in the majority of cases. No love of youth for
maiden could be deeper or truer than that of Vittoria Colonna for the
Marquis of Pescara, to whom she had been engaged from the age of four;
no loyalty could have been greater than that of Elisabetta Gonzaga,
accompanying her crippled husband through all his misfortunes and
exiles, and faithful to his memory till her death.</p>
<p>Nevertheless adultery was rampant. 49 Since most marriages among the
upper classes were diplomatic unions of economic or political interests,
many husbands felt warranted in having a mistress; and the wife, though
she might mourn, usually closed her eyes — or her lips — to the offense.
Among the middle classes some men assumed that adultery was a legitimate
diversion; Machiavelli and his friends seem to have thought nothing of
ex- changing notes about their infidelities. When, in such cases, the
wife avenged herself by imitation, the husband was as like as not to
ignore it, and wear his horns with grace. 50 But the influx of Spaniards
into Italy, via Naples and Alexander VI and Charles V, brought the
Spanish “point of honor” into Italian life, and in t he sixteenth
century the husband felt called upon to punish his wife’s adultery with
death, while preserving his pristine privileges unimpaired. The husband
might desert his wife and still prosper; the deserted wife had no remedy
except to reclaim her dowry, return to her relatives, and live a lonely
life; she was not allowed to marry again.</p>

<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>RENAISSANCE MAN</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of intellectual enfranchisement and moral release
pro- duced “the man of the Renaissance.” He was not typical enough to
merit that title; there were a dozen types of man in that age as in any
other; he was merely the most interesting, perhaps because he was
exceptional. The Renaissance peasant was what peasants have always been
until machinery made agriculture an industry. The Italian proletaire of
1500 was like those of Rome under the Caesars or Mussolini; occupation
makes the man. The Renaissance businessman was like his past and present
peers. The Renais- sance priest, however, was different from the
medieval or modem priest; he believed less and enjoyed more; he could
make love and war. Amid these types was an arresting mutation, a sport
of the species and the time, the kind of man we think of when we recall
the Renaissance, a type unique in history, except that Alcibiades,
seeing him, would have felt reborn.</p>
<p>The qualities of this type revolved about two foci: intellectual and
moral audacity. A mind sharp, alert, versatile, open to every impression
and idea, sensitive to beauty, eager for fame. It was a recklessly
individualistic spirit, set on developing all its potential capacities;
a proud spirit, scorning Chris- tian humility, despising weakness and
timidity, defying conventions, mor- als, tabus, popes, even,
occasionally, God. In the city such a man might lead a turbulent
faction; in the state, an army; in the Church he would gather a hundred
benefices under his cassock, and use his wealth to climb to power. In
art he was no longer an artisan working anonymously with others on a
collective enterprise, as in the Middle Ages; he was “a single and sep
arate person,” who stamped his character upon his works, signed his name
to his paintings, even, now and then, carved it on his statues, like
Michelangelo on the Pietci. Whatever his achievements, this “Renaissance
man” was always in motion and disconte nt, fretting at limits, longing
to be a “universal man”— bold in conception, decisive in deed, eloquent
in speech, skilled in art, acquainted with literature and philosophy, at
home with women in the palace and with soldiers in the camp.</p>
<p>His immorality was part of his individualism. His goal being the
suc-</p>
<p>cessful expression of his personality, and his environment imposing
upon him no standards of restraint either from the example of the clergy
or from</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 581</p>
<p>the terror of a supernatural creed, he allowed himself any means to
his ends, and any pleasure on the way. None the less he had his own
virtues. He was a realist, and seldom talked nonsense except to a
reluctant woman. He had good manners when he was not killing, and even
then he preferred to kill with grace. He had energy, force of character,
direction and unity of will; he accepted the old Roman conception of
virtue as manliness, but added to it skill and intelligence. He was not
needlessly cruel, and he ex- celled the Romans in his capacity for pity.
He was vain, but that was part of his sense of beauty and form. His
appreciation of the beautiful in woman and nature, in art and crime, was
a mainspring of the Renaissance. He re- placed the moral with the
esthetic sense; if his type had multiplied and pre- vailed, an
irresponsible aristocracy of taste would have supplanted the
aristocracies of birth or wealth.</p>
<p>But, again, he was only one of many kinds of Renaissance man. How
different was the idealistic Pico, with his belief in the moral
perfectibility of mankind — or the grim Savonarola, blind to beauty and
absorbed in righteousness — or the gentle gracious Raphael, scattering
beauty about’ him with an open hand — or the demonic Michelangelo,
haunted with the Last Judgment long before he painted it — or the
melodious Politian, who thought there would be pity even in hell — or
the honest Vittorino da Feltre, so suc- cessfully binding Zeno to Christ
— or the second Giuliano de’ Medici, so kindly just that his brother the
Pope considered him unfit for government! We perceive, after every
effort to abbreviate and formulate, that there was no “man of the
Renaissance.” There were men, agreeing only in one thing: that life had
never been lived so intensely before. The Middle Ages had said — or had
pretended to say — No to life; the Renaissance, with all its heart and
soul and might, said Yes.</p>
<p>V. RENAISSANCE WOMAN</p>
<p>The emergence of woman was one of the brightest phases of the period.
Her status in European history has usually risen with wealth, though
Periclean Greece, too near the Orient, was an exception. When hunger is
no longer feared, the male quest turns to sex; and if man still despoils
him- self for gold, it is to lay it at a woman’s feet, or bef ore the
children she has given him. If she resists him he idealizes her. Usually
she has the good sense to resist him, and to make him pay dearly for the
boons whose con- templated splendor swells his veins. If, moreover, she
adds graces of mind and ch aracter to her body’s charms, she gives man
the highest satisfaction</p>
<p>582 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhe can find this side of glory; and in return he raises her to an
almost queenly dominance in his life.</p>
<p>We must not imagine that this was the pleasant role of the
average</p>
<p>woman in the Renaissance; it fell to a fortunate few, while the far
greater number put off their bridal robes to carry domestic burdens and
family headaches to their graves. Hear San Bernardino on the proper time
for beating a wife:</p>
<p>And I say to you men, never beat your wives while they are great</p>
<p>with child, for therein would lie great peril. I say not that you</p>
<p>should never beat them; but choose your time. … I know men who</p>
<p>have more regard for a hen that lays a fresh egg daily than for
their</p>
<p>own wives. Sometimes the hen will break a pot or a cup, but the</p>
<p>man will not beat her, for fear of losing the egg that is her
fruit.</p>
<p>How stark mad, then, are many that cannot suffer a word from their
own lady who bears such fair fruit! For if she speak a word more</p>
<p>than he thinks fit, forthwith he seizes a staff and begins to
chastise</p>
<p>her; and the hen, which cackles all day without ceasing, you
suffer</p>
<p>patiently for her egg’s sake . 52</p>
<p>A girl of good family was carefully trained for success in getting
and</p>
<p>keeping a prosperous mate; this was the major subject of her
curriculum. Till a few weeks before marriage she was kept in relative
seclusion in a convent or in the home, and received from her tutors or
nuns an education as thorough as that which came to all but the scholars
among the men of her class. Usually she learned some Latin, and became
distantly acquainted with the leading figures of Greek and Roman
history, literature, and phi- losophy. She practised some form of music,
and sometimes played at sculp- ture or painting. A few women became
scholars, and publicly debated problems of philosophy with men, like the
learned Cassandra Fedeli of Venice; but this was highly exceptional.
Several women wrote good verse, like Costanza Varano, Veronica Gambara,
and Vittoria Colonna. But the educated woman of the Renaissance retained
her femininity, her Christian- ity, and its moral code; and this gave
her a union of culture and character that made her irresistible to the
higher Renaissance man.</p>
<p>For the lettered men of that age felt her attractiveness intensely,
even to writing and reading books that analyzed her charms in scholarly
detail. Agnolo Firenzuola, a Vallombrosan monk, composed a dialogue
Sopra la bellezza delle donne, on the beauty of women, and carried off
this difficult subject with a skill and erudition hardly becoming a
monk. Beauty itself</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 583</p>
<p>he defines after Plato and Aristotle as “an orderly concord, a
harmony in - scrutably resulting from the composition, union, and
commission of divers members, each of which shall itself be well
proportioned and in a certain sense beautiful, but which, before they
combine to make one body, shall be different and discrepant among them
selves.” 53 He proceeds to examine with finesse every part of the
feminine frame, laying down the standard of beauty for each. The hair
should be thick, long, and blonde — a soft yellow nearing brown; the
skin bright and clear, but not pale white; the eyes dark, large, and
full, with touches of blue in a white iris; the nose must not be
aquiline, for that is especially disconcerting in a woman; the mouth
should be small, but the lips full; the chin round and dimpled; the neck
round and rather long — bu t let not Adam’s apple show; the shoulders
should be broad, the bosom full — with a gentle fall and swell; the
hands white and plump and soft; the legs long, the feet small. 54 We
perceive that Firenzuola had spent much time contemplating his subject,
and had discovered an admirable new topic for philosophy.</p>
<p>Not content with these gifts, Renaissance woman, like any other, dyed
her hair — almost always to blonde — and added false locks to fill it
out; peasant women, having spent their beauty, cut off their tresses and
hung them out for sale. 35 Perfumes were a mania in sixteenth-century
Italy: hair, hats, shirts, stockings, gloves, shoes, all had to be
scented; Aretino thanks Duke Cosimo for perfuming the roll of money he
had sent him; “some objects that date from that period have not yet lost
their odor.” 56 A well-to- do woman’s dressing table was a wilderness of
cosmetics, usually in fancy containers of ivory, silver, or gold. Rouge
was applied not only to the face but to the breasts, which in the larger
cities were left mostly bare. 57 Various preparations were used to
remove blemishes, to polish the fingernails, to render the skin soft and
smooth. Flowers were placed in the hair and on the dress. Pearls,
diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, agates, amethysts, beryls,
topazes, or garnets adorned the fingers in rings, the arms in bracelets,
the head in tiaras, and (after 1525) the ears in earrings; besides which
jewelry might be studded into the headgear, the dress, the shoes, and
the fan.</p>
<p>Feminine dress, if we may judge from the portraits, was rich, heavy,
and uncomfortable. Velvets, silks, and furs hung in massive folds from
the shoulders or — when the shoulders were bare — from fastenings over
the breasts. Dresses were bound with a girdle at the waist, and swept
the floor behind the feet. The shoes of the well-to-do woman were high
of both sole and heel, to protect her feet from the filth of the
streets; nevertheless the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>584</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXupper portion was often of delicate brocade. Handkerchiefs were now
in use in the upper classes; they were made of fine linen, often striped
with gold thread or fringed with lace. Petticoats and lingerie were
trimmed with lace and embroidered with silk. Sometimes the dress reached
up around the neck in a ruff stiffened with metal ribs, and occasionally
rising above the head. The headdress of the women took a hundred forms:
turbans, tiaras, kerchiefs or veils bound with pearls, hoods stiffly
shaped with wire, caps like a boy’s or a forester’s. . . . Frenchmen
visiting Mantua were delightfully shocked to find the Marchioness
Isabella wearing a fancy cap with jeweled feathers, and, beneath,
shoulders and bosom bare almost to the nipples . 68 Preachers complained
about the amount of female bosom that invited the male eye. Now and then
the flair for nudity went out of bounds, and Sacchetti observed of some
women that if they took off their shoes they would be naked . 69 Most
women imprisoned themselves in corsets that c ould be tightened by
turning a key, so that Petrarch pitied “their bellies so cruelly
squeezed that they suffer as much pain from vanity as the martyrs
suffered for religion .” 80</p>
<p>Armed with all these weapons, the Renaissance woman of the upper
classes raised her sex out of medieval bondage and monastic contempt to
be almost the equal of man. She conversed on equal terms with him about
literature and philosophy; she governed states with wisdom, like
Isabella, or with all-too-masculine force, like Caterina Sforza;
sometimes, clad in armor, she followed her mate to the battlefield, and
bettered the instruction of his violence. She refused to leave the room
when rough stories came up; she had a good stomach, and could hear
realistic language without los- ing her modesty or her charm. The
Italian Renaissance is rich in women who made a high place for
themselves by their intelligence or their virtue: Bianca Maria Visconti
who, in the absence of her husband Francesco Sforza, governed Milan so
capably that he used to say he had more confidence in her than in his
whole army, and who at the same time was known for her “piety,
compassion, charity, and beauty of person”; 61 or Emilia Pio, whose
husband died in her youth, but who so cherished his memory that she was
never known, through all her remaining years, to encourage the
attentions of any man; or Lucrezia Tornabuoni, mother and molder of
Lorenzo the Magnificent; or Elisabetta Gonzaga, or Beatrice d’Este, or
the maligned and gentle Lucrezia Borgia; or the Caterina Cornaro who
made Asolo a school for poets, artists, and gentlemen; or Veronica
Gambara, the poetess and salonniere of Correggio; or Vittoria Colonna,
the untouched goddess of Michelangelo.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 585</p>
<p>Vittoria recaptured, without proud display, all the quiet virtue of
a</p>
<p>Roman heroine of the Republic, and combined with it the noblest
features of Christianity. She had distinguished ancestry: her father was
Fabrizio Colonna, grand constable of the Kingdom of Naples; her mother,
Agnese da Montefeltro, was a daughter of Federigo, the scholarly Duke of
Urbino. Betrothed in childhood to Ferrante Francesco d’Avalos, Marquis
of Pescara, she married him at nineteen (1509); and the love that united
them before and after marriage was a finer poem that any of the sonnets
that they ex- changed during his campaigns. At the battle of Ravenna
(1512) he was wounded almost to death, and was taken prisoner; he took
advantage of his captivity to compose A Book of Loves, which he
dedicated to his wife. Meanwhile he had carried on a liaison with one of
Isabella d’Este’s maids of honor. 82 After his release he returned to
Vittoria briefly, then sallied forth on one campaign after another, so
that she seldom saw him again. He led the forces of Charles V at Pavia
(1525), and won a decisive victory. Offered the crown of Naples if he
would join a conspiracy against the Emperor, he thought it over for a
while, then revealed the plot to Charles. When he died (November, 1525)
he had not seen his wife for three years. Ignorant of, or ignoring, his
infidelities, she spent her twenty-two years of widowhood in works of
charity, piety, and devotion to his memory. When she was urged to marry
again she replied: “My husband Ferdina nd, who to you seems dead, is not
dead to me.” 83 She lived in quiet retirement at</p>
<p>The educated women of the Renaissance emancipated themselves with-
out any propaganda of emancipation, purely by their intelligence, char-
acter, and tact, and by the heightened sensitivity of men to their
tangible and intangible charms. They influenced their time in every
field: in poli- tics by their ability to govern states for their absent
husbands; in morals by their combination of freedom, good manners, and
piety; in art by develop- ing a matronly beauty which modeled a hundred
Madonnas; in literature by opening their homes and their smiles to poets
and scholars. There were innumerable satires on women, as in every age;
but for every bitter or sar- castic line there were litanies of devotion
and praise. The Italian Renais-</p>

<p>XXsance, like the French Enlightenment, was bisexual; women moved
into every sphere of life; men ceased to be coarse and crude, and were
molded to finer manners and speech; and civilization, with all its
laxity and violence, took on a grace and refinement such as it had not
known in Europe for a thousand years.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE HOME</li>
</ol>
<p>The rising refinement showed itself in the form and life of the home.
While the dwellings of the populace remained as before — unadorned
white- washed stucco or plaster walls, flagstone floors, an inner court
usually with a well, and around the court one or two stories of rooms
furnished with the simple necessaries of life — the palaces of the
nobles and nouveaux riches took on a splendor and luxury again recalling
Imperial Rome. The wealth that in the Middle Ages had been concentrated
on the cathedral now poured itself out into mansions equipped with such
furniture, conveniences, delicacies, and ornaments as could hardly be
found, north of the Alps, in the seats of princes and kings. The Villa
Chigi and the Palazzo Massimi, both designed by Baldassare Peruzzi,
enclosed a labyrinth of rooms, each ornate with columns and pilasters,
or fretted cornice, or gilded coffered ceiling, or paintings on vault
and walls, or sculptured chimney pieces, or stucco carvings and
arabesques, or floors of marble or tile. Every mansion had elegant beds,
tables, chairs, chests, and cabinets built for a century and cut to
please the eye; its massive credences or buffets were loaded with silver
plate and fancy pottery; it had soft and comfortable beds, fine carpets
and handsome drapes, and linen abundant, enduring, and perfumed. Great
fireplaces warmed the rooms, and lamps, torches, or chandeliers lighted
them. All that was lacking in these palaces was children.</p>
<p>For family limitation rises as the means for supporting children
mount. The Church and the Scriptures bade men increase and multiply, but
com- fort counseled infertility. Even in the countryside, where children
were economic assets, families of six children were rare; in the city,
where children were liabilities, families were small — the richer the
smaller — and many homes had no children at all . 64 What lovely
children Italian families could have appears in the bambini and putti of
the artists, the cantorie of Donatello and Luca della Robbia, and such
sculptural portraits as The Young St. John of Antonio Rossellino in the
Washington National Gallery. The solidarity of the family, the mutual
loyalty and love of parents and children, stand out all the more
attractively amid the moral looseness of the times.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 587</p>
<p>The family was still an economic, moral, and geographical unit.
Usually the debts of one defaulting member were paid by the rest — a
marked ex- ception to the individualism of the age. Rarely did any
member marry or leave the state without the family’s consent. Servants
were freeborn free - spoken members of the family. Paternal authority
was supreme, and was obeyed in all crises; but normally the mother ruled
the household. Ma- ternal love was as fond in the princesses as in the
paupers. Beatrice d’Este writes about her baby boy to her sister
Isabella: “I often wish that you could be here to see him, as I am quite
sure that you would never be able to stop petting and kissing him.” 65
Most families of the middle class kept a register of births, marriages,
deaths, and interesting events, interspersed here and there with
intimate comments. In one such family record Gio- vanni Rucellai
(ancestor of the dramatist of the same name) wrote, toward the end of
his life ( c . 1460), these proud words of a Florentine:</p>
<p>I thank God that he has created me a rational and immortal being;</p>
<p>in a Christian country; close to Rome, the center of the
Christian</p>
<p>faith; in Italy, the noblest country in Christendom; and in
Florence,</p>
<p>the most beautiful city of the whole world. … I thank Our Lord
for</p>
<p>an excellent mother, who, though only in her twentieth year at
the</p>
<p>time of my father’s death, refused all offers of marriage, and de
-</p>
<p>voted herself wholly to her children; and also for an equally
excel-</p>
<p>lent wife, who loved me truly, and cared most faithfully for both</p>
<p>household and children; who was spared to me for many years, and
whose death has been the greatest loss that ever has or could have</p>
<p>befallen me. Recalling all these innumerable favors and benefits,
I</p>
<p>now in my old age desire to detach myself from all earthly things
in</p>
<p>order to devote my whole soul to giving praise and thanks to
Thee,</p>
<p>my Lord, the living source of my being. 66</p>
<p>Two men, who were perhaps one, wrote, about 1436, treatises on the
family and its governance. Agnolo Pandolfini was probably the author of
an eloquent Trattato del governo della famiglia; Leon Battista Alberti,
soon afterward, composed a Trattato della famiglia, whose third book,
“Economico,” is so largely similar to the earlier treatise that some
have thought the two works were different forms of one essay by Alberti.
Per- haps they are both genuine, so alike because they both based
themselves upon Xenophon’s Oeconomicus. Pandolfini’s performance is the

exposing one to suspicion, envy, and abuse. The sources of a man’s
happiness lie not in public office or fame, but in his wife and
children, his economic success, his good repute, and his friends. A man
should marry a wife sufficiently younger than himself to submit to his
instruction and molding; and he should teach her, in the early years of
their marriage, the obligations of motherhood and the arts of household
management. A prosperous life comes from the economical and orderly use
of health, talent, time, and money: of health through continence,
exercise, and a moderate diet; of talent through study and the formation
of honest character by religion and example; of time through shunning
idleness; and of money through a care- ful accounting and balancing of
income, expenditure, and savings. The wise man will invest first of all
in a farm or estate, so arranged as to provide him and his family not
only with a country residence, but with corn, wine, oil, fowl, wood, and
as many as possible of the other necessaries of life. It is well also to
have a house in the city, so that the children may use the educational
facilities there, and learn some of the industrial arts . 67 But the
family should spend as much of the year as possible in the villa and the
country:</p>
<p>While every other possession causes work and danger, fear and</p>
<p>disappointment, the villa brings a great and honorable advantage; the
villa is always true and kind. … In spring the green trees and the</p>
<p>song of the birds will make you joyful and hopeful; in autumn a</p>
<p>moderate exertion will bring forth a hundredfold; all through the</p>
<p>year melancholy will be banished from you. The villa is the spot</p>
<p>where good and honest men love to congregate. . . . Hasten thither,
and fly from the pride of the rich, and the dishonor of evil men .

peasants: “Had I not been bom a rustic, I should readily have been

however, having been a farmer, “what to you are delights are to me a
bore .” 69</p>

<li>PUBLIC MORALITY</li>
</ol>
<p>Pandolfini was right in at least one judgment — that commercial and
pub- lic morality was the least attractive side of Renaissance life.
Then, as now, success, not virtue, was the standard by which men were
judged; even the righteous Pandolfino prays for wealth rather than for
immortal life. Then,</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) THE MORAL RELEASE 589</p>
<p>as now, men itched for money, and stretched their consciences to
grasp it. Kings and princes betrayed their allies, and broke their most
solemn pledges, at the call of gold. Artists were no better: many of
them took advance payments, failed to finish or begin the work, but kept
the money just the same. The papal court itself gave a high example of
money lust; hear again the greatest historian of the papacy:</p>
<p>A deep-rooted corruption had taken possession of nearly all the</p>
<p>officials of the Curia. . . . The inordinate number of gratuities
and</p>
<p>exactions had passed all bounds. Moreover, on all sides deeds were
dishonestly manipulated, and even falsified, by the officials. No</p>
<p>wonder that there arose from all parts of Christendom the loudest</p>
<p>complaints about the corruption and financial extortions of the</p>
<p>papal officials. It was even said that in Rome everything had its</p>
<p>price. 70</p>
<p>The Church still condemned all taking of interest as usury. Preachers
inveighed against it; cities — Piacenza, for example — sometimes forbade
it under pain of exclusion from the sacraments and from Christian
burial. But the lending of money at interest went on, because such loans
were indis- pensable in an expanding commercial and industrial economy.
Laws were passed prohibiting a higher rate than twenty per cent, but we
hear of cases where thirty per cent was charged. Christians competed
with Jews in moneylending, and the town council of Verona complained
that the Chris- tians exacted harder terms than the Jews; 71 public
resentment, however, fell chiefly upon the Jews, and occasionally led to
outbreaks of antisemitic violence. The Franciscans met the problem for
the most helpless borrowers by establishing, through gifts and legacies,
monti di pietd, funds (literally heaps) of charity, from which they made
loans to the needy, at first with- out interest. The first of these was
organized at Orvieto in 1463; soon every major city had one. Their
growth involved expenditures of administra- tion; and the Fifth Lateran
Council (1515) granted the Franciscans the right to charge for each loan
an amount necessary to cover the costs of management. Instructed by this
experience, some theologians of the six- teenth century allowed a
moderate interest on loans. 72 Through the com- petition of the monti di
pietd, and probably more through the increasing competence and rivalry
of the professional bankers, the rate of interest fell rapidly during
the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Industry became more ruthless with its size, and with the
disappearance of a personal relationship between employer and employed.

<p>XXism the serf had enjoyed certain rights along with his burdensome
dues: in sickness, economic depression, war, and old age his lord was
expected to take care of him. In the cities of Italy the guilds
performed something of this function for the better class of labor; but
in general the “free” laborer was free to starve when he could find no
work. When he found it he had to take it on the employer’s terms, and
these were hard. Every invention and improvement in production and
finance added to profits, rarely to wages. Businessmen were as severe
with one another as with their em- ployees; we hear of their many tricks
in competition, their deceptive con- tracts, their innumerable frauds;
73 when they co-operated it was to ruin their competitors in another
town. However, there were instances of a fine sense of honor among many
Italian merchants; and the Italian finan- ciers had the best reputation
in Europe for integrity. 74</p>
<p>Social morality was a blend of violence and chastity. In the
correspond- ence of the times we find many evidences of a tender and
kindly spirit; and the Italians could not compete with the Spaniards in
ferocity, or with the French soldiery in wholesale butchery. Yet no
nation in Europe could match the endless merciless slander that swept
around all prominent persons in Rome; and who but the Italians of the
Renaissance could have called Aretino divine? Private violence
flourished. Family feuds were refreshed by the breakdown of custom and
belief, and the inadequate administration of the laws; men took
vengeance into their own hands, and families mur- dered one another for
generations. At Ferrara, as late as 1537, dueling to the death was legal
and practised; even boys were allowed to fight each other with knives in
these legal lists. 75 The strife of parties was bitterer than anywhere
else in Europe. Crimes of violence were innumerable. Assassins could be
bought almost as cheaply as indulgences. The palaces of Roman nobles
swarmed with bravi, thugs ready to kill at a nod from their lords.
Everyone had a dagger, and brewers of poison found many customers; at
last the people of Rome could hardly believe in the natural death of any
man of prominence or wealth. Important personages required that all food
or drink served to them should first be tasted by another in their
presence. Strange stories were told in Rome of a venenum atterminatum, a
poison that took effect only after an interval long enough to cover up
the trail of the poisoner. A man had to live on the alert in those days;
any evening, if he left the house, he might be ambushed and robbed, and
be lucky not to be killed; even in church he was not safe; and on the
highways he had to be ready for brigands. The Renaissance mind, living
amid these dangers, had to be as sharp as an assassin’s blade.</p>
<p>THE MORAL RELEASE</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>59 *</p>
<p>Sometimes cruelty was collective and contagious. At Arezzo, in 1502,
a riot broke out against an oppressive Florentine commission; hundreds
of Florentines in Arezzo were slain in the streets; whole families were
wiped out. One victim was stripped naked and hanged, and a lighted torch
was thrust between his buttocks; whereupon the jolly crowd nicknamed the
corpse il sodomita .™ Tales of violence, cruelty and lust were as
popular as superstition. The court of Ferrara, brilliant with poetry and
art, was</p>
<p>ghastly with princely crimes and royal punishments. The
irresponsibility of despots like the Visconti and the Malatestas
provided a model and stim- ulus for the amateur violence of the
people.</p>
<p>The morals of war worsened with time. In the early days of the
Renais- sance almost all battles were modest engagements of mercenaries,
who fought without frenzy and knew when to stop; victory was judged won
as soon as a few men had fallen; and a live ransomable prisoner was
worth more than a dead enemy. As the condottieri became more powerful,
and armies larger and more costly, troops were allowed to plunder
captured cities in lieu of regular pay; resistance to plunder led to the
massacre of the inhabitants, and ferocity grew at the smell of the blood
it shed. Even so, the cruelty of the Italians in war was far exceeded by
the invading Spanish and French. When the French took Capua in 1501,
says Guicciardini, they “committed great slaughter . . . and women of
all ranks and qualities, even such as were consecrated to the service of
God . . . fell a sacrifice to their lust or avarice; many of these poor
creatures were afterwards sold at Rome for a small price,” 77 —
apparently to Christians. The enslavement of prisoners of war increased
as the wars of the Renaissance progressed.</p>
<p>There were instances of fine loyalty of man to man, of citizen to
state; but by and large the development of cunning put a premium on
deceit. Generals sold themselves to the highest bidder, and then, in
mid-campaign, negotiated with the enemy for a higher price. Governments
too changed sides in the middle of a war, and allies became foes by the
scratch of a pen. Princes and popes violated safe-conducts given by
them; 78 govern- ments consented to the secret assassination of their
enemies in other states. 79 Traitors could be found in any city or camp:
instance Bernardino del Corte, who sold Lodovico’s Castello to France;
the Swiss and Italians who betrayed Lodovico to the French; Francesco
Maria della Rovere, who kept his papal troops from going to the rescue
of the pope in 1527; Malatesta Baglioni, who sold out Florence in 1530.
. . . As religious belief declined, the notion of right and wrong was
replaced, in many minds, by that of practicality; and as governments
seldom enjoyed the authority of legitima-</p>

<p>XXtion by time, the habit of obedience to law lapsed, and custom had
to be supplanted by force. Against the tyranny of governments the only
re- course was tyrannicide.</p>
<p>Corruption ran through every department of administration. In Siena
the bureau of finance had finally to be put into the hands of a saintly
monk, since everybody else had embezzled. Except in Venice, the courts
were notoriously venal. One of Sacchetti’s stories tells of a judge who
was bribed with the gift of an ox; but the opponent sent the judge a cow
and a calf, and won his case. 80 Justice was expensive; the poor had to
get along without it, and found it cheaper to kill than to litigate. Law
itself was mak- ing some progress, but chiefly in theory. At Padua and
Bologna, Pisa and Perugia, there were famous jurists — Cino da Pistoia,
Bartolus of Sassofer- rato, Baldo degli Ubaldi — whose reinterpretation
of Roman law dominated jurisprudence for two centuries. Nautical and
commercial law expanded as foreign trade increased. Giovanni da Legnano
opened a path for Grotius with a Tractatus de bello (1360), the earliest
known work on the laws of war.</p>
<p>But the practice of law was less excellent than its theory. Though
police protection of life and property was taking form, especially in
Florence, it could not keep abreast of crime. Lawyers abounded. Torture
continued to be used in the examination of witnesses as well as of the
accused. Punish- ments were barbarous. In Bologna a convict might be
suspended in a cage from one of the leaning towers, and left to fester
in the sun; 81 in Siena a condemned man was slowly tom to pieces with
red-hot pincers while bound to a cart slowly moving through the streets;
82 in Milan, under Petrarch’s host Giovann i Visconti, prisoners were
subjected to piecemeal mutilation. 88 Early in the sixteenth century the
custom began of con- demning prisoners to pull the heavy oars of
galleys; so the ships of Julius II were manned by galley slaves chained
by the leg. 84</p>
<p>Against these barbarities we may place the high development of or-
ganized charity. Every man who made a will left a sum to be distributed
among the poor of his parish. Since beggars were numberless, some
churches provided the equivalent of modem “soup kitchens”; so the church
of Santa Maria in Campo Santo, at Rome, fed thirteen beggars daily, and
two thousand on Mondays and Fridays. 85 Hospitals, lazarettos, asylums
for incurables, for the poor, for orphans, for destitute pilgrims, for
reformed prostitutes, were numerous in Renaissance as in medieval Italy.
Pistoia and Viterbo were celebrated for the scope of their charities. At
Mantua</p>
<p>Lodovico Gonzaga established the Ospedale Maggiore for the care of
the</p>
<p>THE MORAL RELEASE</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>593</p>
<p>poor and infirm, and gave it three thousand ducats a year of
governmental funds. 86 At Venice a society known as the Pellegrini,
including in its mem- bership Titian and the two Sansovini, provided
mutual aid to its members, dowered poor girls, and practised other
charities. Florence in 1500 had seventy-three civic organizations
devoted to works of charity. The Con- fraternita della Misericordia,
founded in 1244 but allowed to decay, was restored in 1475; its members
were laymen who visited the sick, practised other charities, and earned
the love of the people by their courageous at- tendance upon victims of
the plague; their silent black-robed processions are still among the
most impressive sights of Florence. 87 Venice had a similar
Confraternita di San Rocco; Rome had a Sodality of the Dolorosa, now 504
years old; and Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici founded in 1519 the
Confraternita della Carita to take care of poor persons above the
mendicant class, and to provide decent burial for the destitute. The
private charity of unrecorded millions lfent some mitigation to the
struggle of man against man, nature, and death.</p>

<li>MANNERS AND AMUSEMENTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid violence and dishonesty, and the boisterous life of university
stu- dents, and the rough humor and kindliness of peasant and
proletaire, good manners grew as one of the arts of the Renaissance.
Italy now led Europe in personal and social hygiene, dress, table
manners, cooking, conversation, and recreations; and in all of these
except dress Florence claimed to lead Italy. Florence patriotically
mourned the filth of other cities, and Italians made Tedesco, German, a
synonym for coarseness of language and life. 88 The old Roman habit of
frequent bathing continued in the educated classes; the well-to- do
displayed their finery and “took the waters” at ps of lace. At a
tournament given by Lorenzo de’ Medici his brother Giuliano wore
garments costing 8000 ducats. 89</p>
<p>A revolution in table manners came in the fifteenth century with the
in- creasing substitution of a fork for the fingers in carrying food to
the mouth. Thomas Coryat, touring Italy about 1600, was struck by the
novel custom,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XX“which,” he wrote, “is not used in any other country that I saw in
my travels”; and he shared in introducing the idea into England. 90
Knives, forks, and spoons were of brass, sometimes of silver — which was
lent out to neighbors preparing banquets. Meals were modest except on
such out- standing occasions or at state functions; then excess was
compulsory. Spices — pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, juniper, ginger,
etc. — were used in abundance to flavor food and stimulate thirst; hence
every host offered his guests a variety of wines. The reign of garlic in
Italy can be traced back to 1 548, but doubtless had begun long before.
There was very little drunk- enness or gluttony; the Italians of the
Renaissance, like the later French, were gourmets, not gourmands. When
men ate apart from the women of their families they might invite a
courtesan or two, as Aretino did when he entertained Titian. More
careful people would grace the meal with music, poetic improvisations,
and educated conversation.</p>
<p>The art of conversation — bel parlare — to speak with intelligence,
urbanity, courtesy, clarity, and wit — was reinvented by the
Renaissance. Greece and Rome had known it, and here and there in
medieval Italy — as at the courts of Frederick II and Innocent III — it
had been kept precariously alive. Now in Lorenzo’s Florence, in
Elisabetta’s Urbino, in Leo’s Rome, it flourished again: nobles and
their ladies, poets and philosophers, generals and scholars, artists and
musicians met in the companionship of minds, quoted famous authors, made
an occasional obeisance to religion, graced their language with a light
fantastic touch, an d basked in one another’s audience. Such
conversation was so admired that many essays and treatises were cast in
dialogue form to appropriate its elegance. In the end the game was
carried to excess; language and thought became too precious and refined;
an enervating dilettantism softened manliness. Urbino became Rambouillet
in France, and Moliere attacked les precieuses ridicules just in time to
save the art of good converse for France.</p>
<p>Despite the preciosity of a few, Italian speech enjoyed a freedom of
sub- ject and epithet that would not be allowed by social manners today.
Since general conversation was rarely heard by unmarried women of good
char- acter, it was assumed that sex might be openly discussed. But
beyond this, and even in the highest male circles, there was a looseness
of sexual jest, a gay freedom in poetry, a coarse obscenity in drama,
that seem to us now among the less presentable aspects of the
Renaissance. Educated men could scribble lewd verses on statuary, the
refined Bembo wrote in praise of Priapus. 91 Youths competed in
obscenity and profanity to prove their ma- turity. Men of all classes
swore great oaths and curses, often involving</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 595</p>
<p>blasphemy of the most sacred names in the Christian faith. And yet
the phrases of courtesy had never been so flowery, forms of address had
never been so gracious; women kissed the hand of any intimate male
friend on meeting or leaving him, and men kissed the hand of a woman;
presents were ever passing from friend to friend; and tact of word and
deed reached a development that seemed unattainable in northern Europe.
Italian manuals of manners became favored texts beyond the Alps.</p>
<p>The same was true of Italian handbooks of dancing, fencing, and other
recreations; in recreation, as in conversation and profanity, Italy led
the Christian world. On summer evenings girls danced in the squares
of</p>
<p>Florence, and the most graceful won a silver garland; in the villages
young men and women danced on the green. In homes and at formal balls
women danced with women or men, and men with men or women; in any case
the aim was grace. In the Renaissance the ballet flourished; the poetry
of mo- tion was added to the arts.</p>
<p>Cardplaying was even more popular than dancing; in the fifteenth cen-
tury it became a mania in all classes; Leo X was an addict. Often it
involved gambling; recall how Cardinal Raffaello Riario won 14,000
ducats in two games with the son of Innocent VIII. Men gambled also with
dice, and sometimes loaded them. 92 This too became a passion, which
legislation vainly sought to moderate. In Venice gambling ruined so many
noble families that the Council of Ten twice forbade the sale of cards
or dice, and called upon servants to report masters violating these
ordinances. 93 The monte di pietd established by Savonarola in 1495
required of borrowers a pledge to avoid gambling at least till the loan
had been paid. 94 Sedate peo- ple brooded over chess, and fondled
expensive sets; Giacomo Loredano at Venice had chessmen valued at 5000
ducats.</p>
<p>Young men had their special games, mostly in the open air. The upper-
class Italian was trained to ride, wield sword and lance, and tilt in
tourna- ments. For such contests the towns, on certain holidays, roped
off space in a square, usually convenient to windows and balconies
whence the ladies could encourage their knights. As these combats proved
insufficiently mortal, some rash youths, in the Roman Colosseum in 1332,
introduced the bullfight, with a man on foot armed only with a spear; on
that occasion eighteen knights, all of old Roman families, were killed,
and only eleven bulls. 96 Such contests were occasionally repeated in
Rome and Siena, but never caught the Italian taste. Horse racing was
more popular, and aroused the enthusiasm of Romans, Sienese, and
Florentines alike. Hunting, fal- conry, foot races, boat regattas,
tennis, and boxing rounded out the sports,</p>
<p>596 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXand kept the Italians individually in form, while collectively the
defense of the cities was left to mercenary aliens.</p>
<p>All in all it was a gay life despite its toils and risks, its natural
and super- natural terrors. City folk had the pleasure of walking or
riding out to the countryside, to the banks of the rivers or the shores
of the sea; they culti- vated flowers to adorn their homes and persons,
and, by their villas, carved stately gardens into geometrical forms. The
Church was generous with holy days, and the state added holidays of its
own. Water festivals were held on the Venetian lagoons, on the Arno at
Venice, the Mincio at</p>
<p>Mantua, the Ticino at Milan. Or, on special days, great processions
moved down the city streets, with floats and banners designed for the
guilds by artists of international renown; bands played, pretty girls
sang and danced, dignitaries marched; and in the evening fireworks shot
their evanescent wonder into the sky. On Holy Saturday, in Florence,
three flints brought from the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem lit a taper
that lit a candle that- carried along a wire by a mechanical dove —
reached and set off the fire- works in the Carro or emblematic car of
state in the piazza before the cathedral. On Corpus Christi the parade
would be halted to hear a cantata sung by a choir of girls and boys, or
see an episode of Scriptural history or pagan mythology enacted by some
confraternity. If a great dignitary came to town he might be received
with a trionfo, a procession arranged with chariots in the manner of a
Roman triumph for a victorious general. When Leo X visited his beloved
Florence in 1 5 1 3, all the city turned out to watch his triumphal car
— decorated and painted by Pontormo — pass under great arches that
spanned the central street; seven other chariots moved in that
cavalcade, bearing impersonations of famous figures in Roman history; on
the last a naked boy, covered with gilt, represented the coming, with
Leo, of the Golden Age; but the boy died shortly afterward from the
effect of the gilt. 96</p>
<p>At carnival time the processional floats in Florence might symbolize
some idea like Prudence, Hope, Fear, Death, or the elements, the winds,
the seasons, or tell in pantomime a story like Paris and Helen, or
Bacchus and Ariadne, with songs appropriate to ea ch scene; for such a
“masque” Lorenzo wrote his famous ode to youth and joy. On those
carnival nights everyone from urchins to cardinals wore masks, played
pranks, and made love, with a freedom that revenged itself in advance
for the restraints of Lent. In 1512, when Florence seemed still
prosperous, but unsuspected mis- fortunes were only a few months away,
Piero di Cosimo and Francesco Granacci designed for a carnival pageant a
“Masque of the Triumph of</p>
<p>THE MORAL RELEASE</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>597</p>
<p>D eath”: an enormous triumphal car, drawn by black buffaloes, was cov
- ered with a black cloth on which were painted skeletons and white
crosses; in the car stood a colossal figure of Death with a scythe in
his hand; around him were tombs, and lugubrious figures on whose black
robes were painted white bones gleaming in the dark; and behind the car
masked figures walked, whose black hoods were painted with death heads
both in front and behind. From the tombs on the cars rose other figures,
painted to seem only bones; and these skeletons chanted a song reminding
men that all must die. Before and after the car came a cavalcade of
decrepit horses, bearing the bodies of dead men . 97 So, at the height
of carnival, Piero di Cosimo, echoing Savonarola, pronounced his
judgment on the pleasures of Italy, and his prophecy of the doom to
come.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>DRAMA</li>
</ol>
<p>In such masques and carnival fetes the Italian drama had one of its
progeni- tors. For often some scene, usually from sacred history, would
be performed on one of the floats or cars, or on temporary stages at
points on the procession route. But the primary source of the Italian
drama was the divozione , an epi- sode of the Christian story acted by
the members of any guild, sometimes by professional players belonging to
a confraternity that made a business of pre- senting such spectacles.
The texts of several divozioni have come down through time, and show a
surprising dramatic power; so the Virgin, finding Christ in Jerusalem
and then again losing him, searches frantically for him, crying out: “O
my so loving Son! O my Son, where have you gone? O my so gracious Son,
through what gate have you gone? O my divine Son, you were so sorrow-
ful when you left me! Tell me, for the love of God, where, where has my
Son gone ?” 98</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century, especially in Florence, a more developed
form of drama, the sacra rappresentazione, was played in the oratory of
a guild, or in the refectory of a convent, or in a field or public
square. The scenic arrange- ments for these performances were often
complex and ingenious: skies were simulated by vast awnings painted with
stars; clouds were represented by masses of wool suspended and swaying
in the air; angels were impersonated by boys supported aloft on metal
frames concealed in waving draperies. The libretto was usually in poetic
form, accompanied with music on the viol or the lute. Lorenzo de’ Medici
and the Pulci were among the poets who wrote words for such religious
plays. Politian, in his Orfeo, adapted the form of the sacra rap-
presentazione to a pagan theme.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other components of Italian life were sharing in the birth
of Italian drama. The farse or farces that had long been played by
passing mum-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXmers in the medieval towns contained the germ of Italian comedy.
Some players excelled in improvising dialogue for simple scenarios or
plots; this commedia dell’ arte was a favorite vehicle of the Italian
genius for satire and burlesque. In such farces the traditional masks or
characters of popular comedy took form and name: Pantalone, Arlecchino,
Pulcinella or Punchinello.</p>
<p>The humanists played their part in the complex of factors leading to
the drama by restoring the texts, and arranging performances, of ancient
Roman comedies. Twelve plays of Plautus were discovered in 1427, and
served as an additional stimulus. At Venice, Ferrara, Mantua, Urbino,
Siena, Rome the comedies of Plautus and Terence were staged, and the old
classic tradition soared over centuries to form again a secular theater.
In i486 the Menaechmi of Plautus was for the first time presented in
Italian, and the transition from ancient to Renaissance drama was fully
prepared. Toward the end of the fifteenth century the religious drama
lost its hold on educated audiences in Italy; pagan subjects
increasingly replaced Christian themes; and when native dramatists like
Bibbiena, Machiavelli, Ariosto, and Aretino wrote plays, it was in the
ribald style of Plautus, a world away from the once-beloved stories of
Mary and Christ. All the old scenes of Roman comedy, all the superficial
plots turning on mistaken sex or identity or rank, all the stock
characters, including panders and prostitutes, with which Plautus had
pleased the groundlings, all the old plebian coarseness and rough play,
reappeared in these Italian com- edies.</p>
<p>• Despite the preservation of Seneca’s plays, and the recovery of the
Greek drama, tragedy never acquired a standing on the Renaissance stage.
Even the upper classes wished to be amused rather than deepened, and
turned a cold eye upon Gian Trissino’s Sophonisba (1515), and Giovanni
Rucellai’s Rosa - munda , which in the same year was performed in the
Rucellai gardens at Florence before Leo X.</p>
<p>It was the misfortune of Italian comedy that it took form when
Italian morals were at nadir. That such plays as Bibbiena’s Calandra and
Machiavelli’s Mandra - gola could satisfy the tastes of the Italian
upper classes, even at refined Urbino, and could be performed before
popes without arousing protest, reveals again how intellectual freedom
can comport with moral deterioration. When the Counter Reformation came
with the Council of Trent (1545^, the morals of clergy and laity were
severely censored, and the comedy of the Renaissance was banished from
the amusements of Italian society.</p>
<p>X. MUSIC</p>
<p>It was a redeeming feature of Italian comedy that ballets,
pantomimes, and concerts were presented as intermezzi between the acts.
For next to love itself, music was the chief recreation and consolation
of every class in</p>

<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>Italy. Montaigne, traveling in Tuscany in 1581, was “astounded to see
peasants with lutes in their hands, and, beside them, shepherds reciting
A riosto by heart”; but this, he adds, “is what we may see in all of
Italy.” 89 Renaissance painting has a thousand representations of people
playing music, from the luting angels at the Madonna’s feet in so many
Corona - tions, and Melozzo’s serenading se raphim, to the quiet
exaltation of the man at the harpischord in The Concert; and note the
boy — whom we can hardly believe to be the painter himself — in the
center of Sebastiano del Piombo’s Three Ages of Man. The literature
likewise conveys a picture of a people singing or playing music in their
homes, at their work, on the street, in music academies, monasteries,
nunneries, churches, in processions, masques, trionfi, and pageants, in
religious or secular plays, in the lyric passages and interludes of
dramas, in such outings as Boccaccio imagined in the Decam- eron. Rich
men kept a variety of musical instruments in their homes, and arranged
private musicales. Women organized clubs for the study and per- formance
of music. Italy was — is — mad about music.</p>
<p>Folk song flourished at all times, and learned music periodically
rejuve- nated itself at that fount; popular melodies were adapted for
complex madrigals, for hymns, even for passages in music for the Mass.
“In Flor - ence,” says Cellini, “peopl e were wont to meet on the public
streets of a summer night” to sing and dance. 100 Street singers— canton
di piazza — strummed their sad or merry notes on handsome lutes; people
gathered to sing laudes, hymns of praise, to the Virgin before her
street or roadside shrines; and in Venice mating songs rose to the moon
from a hundred gondolas, or throaty lovers hopefully serenaded hesitant
lasses in the mystic shadows of labyrinthine canals. Almost every
Italian could sing, and nearly as many could sing in simple vertical
harmony. Hundreds of these popu- lar part songs have come down to us
under the picturesque name of frottole, little fruits; usually short,
usually amorous; arranged for a dominant soprano supported by tenor,
alto, and bass. Whereas in previous centuries the tenor voice had “held”
the melody and so derived its name, now in the fifteenth the air was
carried by the soprano — so called because its music was written above
the rest. This part did not need a female voice; as often as not it was
sung by a boy, or by the falsetto of an adult male. ( Castrati did not
ap- pear in the papal choir till 1562.) 101</p>
<p>Among the educated classes considerable knowledge of music was re-
quired. Castiglione demands of his courtier or gentleman some amateur
proficiency in music, “which not only doth make sweet the minds of men,
but also many times doth wild beasts tame.” 102 Every person of culture
was</p>
<p>6oo</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXexpected to read simple music at sight, accompany himself on some
instru- ment, and take part in an impromptu musicale. 103 Sometimes
people joined in a ballata that involved a union of singing, dancing,
and instrumental music. Universities after 1400 offered courses and
degrees in music; there were hundreds of music academies; Vittorino da
Feltre founded a school of music at Mantua about 1425; our
“conservatories” of music are called so because in Naples many
orphanages ( conservatori ) were used as music schools. 104 Music was
further spread by the adaptation of printing to musical notation; about
1476 Ulrich Hahn printed at Rome a complete missal with movable type for
notes and lines; and in 1501 Ottaviano de’ Petrucci began at Venice the
commercial printing of motets and frottole.</p>
<p>At the courts music was more prominent than any other art except
those of personal adornment. Usually the ruler chose a favorite church,
whose choir became the object of his care; he paid goodly sums to
attract to it the finest available voices and instrumentalists from
Italy, France, and Bur- gundy; he trained new singers from their
childhood, as Federigo did at Urbino; and he expected the members of the
choir to perform also for his state ceremonies and court festivities.
Guillaume Dufay of Burgundy di- rected music at the court of the
Malatestas in Rimini and Pesaro, and at the papal chapel in Rome, for a
quarter of a century (1419-44). Galeazzo Maria Sforza about 1460
organized two chapel choirs, and brought to them from France Josquin
Depres, then the most famous composer in western Europe. When Lodovico
Sforza welcomed Leonardo to Milan it was as a musician; and it is to be
noted that Leonardo was accompanied, in going from Florence to Milan, by
Atalante Migliorotti, a celebrated musician and maker of musical
instruments. A still more famous maker of lyres, lutes, organs, and
clavichords was Lorenzo Gusnasco of Pavia, who made Milan one of his
homes. The court of Lodovico was flush with singers: Narcisso,
Testagrossa, Cordier of Flanders, and Cristoforo Romano, chastely loved
by Beatrice. Pedro Maria of Spain conducted concerts in the palace and
for the public; and Franchino Gaffuri founded and taught in a famous
private music school in Milan. Isabella d’Este was devoted to music,
made it the chief theme of decoration in her inner sanctum, and herself
played several instruments. When she ordered a clavichord from Lorenzo
Gusnasco she specified that the keyboard should respond to a light
touch, “for our hands are so delicate that we cannot play well i f the
keys are too stiff.” 105 At her court lived the leading lutanist of his
day, Marchetto Cara, and Bartolom- meo Tromboncino, who composed such
alluring madrigals that when he</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 6oi</p>
<p>killed his unfaithful wife no punishment was meted out to him, and
the matter was passed over as a discord soon to be resolved.</p>
<p>Finally the cathedrals and the churches, the monasteries and the
nunneries resounded with music. In Venice, Bologna, Naples, Milan, the
nuns sang Vespers so movingly that crowds flocked to hear them. Sixtus
IV or- ganized the famous Sistine Chapel choir; Julius II added, in
St. Peter’s, a capella Iulia, or Julian chapel choir, which trained
singers for the Sistine choir. This was the summit of the Latin world ’s
musical art in the Renais - sance; to it came the greatest singers from
all Roman Catholic countries. Plain chant was still the letter of canon
law in church music; but here and there the ars nova of France — a form
of complex counterpoint — made its way into the Roman choirs and
prepared for Palestrina and Victoria. Once it had been held undignified
to have any other musical instrument than the organ accompany a church
choir; but in the sixteenth century a variety of instruments were
brought in to give church music some of the grace and adornment of
secular performances. At St. Mark’s in Venice the Flemish master, Adrian
Willaert of Bruges, presided over the choirs for thirty-five years, and
trained them to such performances as made Rome envious. At Florence
Antonio Squarcialupi organized a School of Har- mony, of which Lorenzo
was a member. For a generation Antonio reigned over the cathedral choir,
and the great duomo rang with music that stilled all philosophic doubt.
Leon Battista Alberti was a doubter, but when the choir sang he
believed:</p>
<p>All other modes of singing weary with repetition; only religious</p>
<p>music never palls. I know not how others are affected; but for
my-</p>
<p>self those hymns and psalms of the Church produce on me the very</p>
<p>effect for which they were designed, soothing all disturbance of the
soul, and inspiring a certain ineffable languor full of reverence
to-</p>
<p>ward God. What heart of man is so rude as not to be softened when he
hears the rhythmic rise and fall of those voices, complete and</p>
<p>true, in cadences so sweet and flexible?- I assure you that I
never</p>
<p>listen … to the Greek words ( Kyrie eleison) that call on God for</p>
<p>aid against our human wretchedness, without weeping. Then, too,</p>
<p>I ponder what power music brings with it to soften us and soothe .
106</p>
<p>Despite all this popularity, music was the one art in which Italy
lagged behind France during most of the Renaissance. Shorn of papal
revenues by the flight of the popes to Avignon, and with the courts of
the despots still culturally immature in the fourteenth century, Italy
lacked then the</p>
<p>602</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmeans and the spirit for the higher grades of music. She produced
lovely madrigals (a word of uncertain derivation), but these songs,
modeled on those of the Proven§al troubadours, were set to a musical
frame of such strictly regulated polyphony that the form died of its own
rigidity.</p>
<p>The pride of trecento music in Italy was Francesco Landini, organist
of San Lorenzo in Florence. Though blind from his childhood, he became
one of the finest and most loved musicians of his time, honored as an
or- ganist, lutanist, composer, poet, and philosopher. But even he took
his lead from France; his two hundred secular compositions applied to
Italian lyrics the ars nova that had captured France a generation
before. The “new art” was doubly new: it accepted binary rhythms as well
as the</p>
<p>hurled his thunderbolts in all directions, aimed one at the ars nova
as fanci- ful and degenerate, and his prohibition had some effect in
discouraging musical development in Italy. However, John XXII could not
live forever, though at times it seemed possible; after his death at the
age of ninety (1334) the new art triumphed in the learned music of
France, and shortly thereafter in Italy.</p>
<p>At Avignon French and Flemish singers and composers constituted the
papal choir. When the papacy returned to Rome it brought with it a large
number of French, Flemish, and Dutch composers and singers; and for a
century these alien musicians and their successors dominated the music
of Italy. As late as Sixtus IV all the voices in the papal choir were
from beyond the Alps; and a like foreign supremacy ruled in the music of
the courts in the fifteenth century. When Squarcialupi died ( c . 147
5), Lorenzo chose a Dutchman, Heinrich Ysaac, to succeed him as organist
in the cathedral at Florence. Heinrich wrote music for some of the canti
carnascialeschi, and for Politian’s lyrics, and he taught the future Leo
X to love — even to compose — French songs. 107 For a time the chansons
of France were sung in Italy, as once Italy had recited the lays of the
troubadours.</p>
<p>This invasion of Italy by French musicians, preceding by a century
its invasion by French armies, produced toward 1520 a revolution in
Italian music. For these men from the north — and the Italians whom they
trained — were steeped in the ars nova, and applied it in setting to
music the lyric poetry of Italy. In Petrarch, Ariosto, Sannazaro, and
Bembo — later in Tasso and Guarini — they found delectable verses crying
out for music; indeed, had not poetry always intended itself to be at
least a recitative, if not a song? Petrarch’s canzoniere had already
lured musicians; now every</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 603</p>
<p>line of it was set to music, some stanzas a dozen times or more;
Petrarch is the most completely musicked poet in world literature. Or
there were little lyrics of unknown authorship but simple and viable
sentiment, that touched the chords of every heart, and invited the
strings of every instru- ment. E.g.:</p>
<p>One from the other borrowing leaves and flowers,</p>
<p>I saw fair maidens beneath summer trees,</p>
<p>Weaving bright garlands with low love ditties.</p>
<p>Mid that sweet sisterhood the loveliest</p>
<p>Turned her soft eyes to me and whispered, “Take!”</p>
<p>Love-lost I stood, and not a word I spake.</p>
<p>My heart she read, and her fair garland gave;</p>
<p>Therefore I am her servant to the grave. 108</p>
<p>To such verses the composers applied the full and complex music of
the motet: polyphony in which all four parts — sung by four or eight
voices — were of equal value, instead of three parts subserving one; and
all the complex subtlety of counterpoint* and fugue wove the four
independent rivulets of sound into a stream of harmony. So rose the
Italian madrigal of the sixteenth century — one of the fairest flowers
of Italian art. Whereas in Dante’s time music had been a handmaid to
poetry, now it became a full-fledged partner, not obscuring the words,
not slurring the sentiment, but uniting them with a music that made them
doubly stir the soul, while delighting with its technical skill the
educated mind.</p>
<p>Almost all the great composers of sixteenth-century Italy, even
Pales- trina, turned their art now and then to the madrigal. Philippe
Verdelot, a Frenchman living in Italy, and Costanza Festa, an Italian,
contest the honor of having first developed the new form, between 1520
and 1530; soon after them came the Arcadelt — a Fleming in Rome —
mentioned by Rabelais. 109 In Venice Adrian Willaert relaxed from his
duties as choir- master at San Marco to compose the finest madrigals of
his time.</p>
<p>Usually the madrigal was sung without instrumental accompaniment.
Musical instruments were innumerable , but only the organ dared compete
with the human voice. Instrumental music slowly developed in the early
sixteenth century out of music forms originally intended for dances or
choruses; so the pavane, the saltarello, and the saraband graduated from
dance accompaniments to instrumental pieces, alone or in suite; and
the</p>
<p>•This term arose about 1300 as punctum contra punctum— point counter
point, note against note; notes being then indicated by points.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>604</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXmusic for a madrigal, played without song, became the instrumental
can- zone , the distant progenitor of the sonata, 109 “ and therefore of
the sym- phony.</p>
<p>The organ was already in the fourteenth century almost as highly de-
veloped as today. The pedal board appeared in Germany and the Low
Countries in that age, and was soon adopted in France and Spain; Italy
de- layed acceptance of it till the sixteenth century. By that time most
large organs had two or three keyboards, with a variety of stops and
couplers. Great church organs were themselves works of art, designed,
carved, and painted by masters. The same love of form went into the
making of other musical instruments. The lute — the favorite instrument
of the home — was built of wood and ivory, shaped like a pear, pierced
with sound holes in a graceful pattern, with a finger board divided by
frets of silver or brass, and ending in a pegbox turned at a right angle
to the neck. A pretty woman plucking the strings of a lute held in her
lap made a picture that went to the head of many a sensitive Italian.
Harps, citherns, psalters, dulcimers, and guitars were also favorites
with musical fingers.</p>
<p>For those who preferred fiddling to plucking there were viols of
diverse sizes, including the tenor viola da braccio , held on the arm,
and the bass viola da gamba, resting against the leg. The latter became
the later violon- cello, and the viol, about 1 540, became the violin.
Wind instruments were less popular than the stringed; the Renaissance
had the same objection that Alcibiades had raised to making music by
puffing out the cheeks; neverthe- less there were flutes and fifes
(“pipes”), bagpi pes, trumpets, horns, flageolets, and the shawm or
oboe. Percussion instruments — drums, tabors, cymbals, tambourines,
castanets — added their fury to the ensemble. All Renaissance musical
instruments were of Oriental origin except for the keyboard that was
added to other instruments besides the organ to indi- rectly strike or
pluck the strings. The oldest of these keyboard instru- ments was the
clavichord ( clavis meaning key), which appeared in the twelfth century
and had a sentimental resurrection in the days of Bach; here the strings
were struck with little brass tangents operated by the keys. In the
sixteenth century it was displaced by the clavicembalo or harpsichord,
whose strings were plucked by points of quill or leather at- tached to
woode n “jacks” that rose when the keys were depressed. The virginal was
an English, the spinet an Italian, variant, of the harpsichord.</p>
<p>All these instruments were as yet subordinate to the voice; and the
great virtuosos of the Renaissance were singers. But at the baptism of
Alfonso of Ferrara in 1476 we hear of a feast in the Schifanoia Palace,
at which a</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE MORAL RELEASE 605</p>
<p>concert was given by a hundred trumpeters, pipers, and tambourine
play- ers. In the sixteenth century the Signory of Florence employed a
regular band of musicians, of which Cellini was one. Performances by
several instruments in concert were given in this period, but they were
still for the aristocratic few. On the other hand solo instrumental
performances were almost fanatically popular. Men went to church not
always to pray but to hear a great organist like Squarcialupi or
Orcagna. When Pietro Bono played the lute at the court of Borso in
Ferrara the souls of the listeners, we are told, flew out of this world
into another . 110 The great executants were the happy favorites of a
day, who asked no fame of posterity but received all their renown before
their deaths.</p>
<p>Musical theory lagged a generation behind practice: performers
in-</p>
<p>novated, professors denounced, then debated, then approved. Meanwhile
the principles of polyphony, counterpoint, and fugue were formulated for
easier instruction and transmission. The great musical feature of the
Ren- aissance was not theory, nor even technical advances; it was the
increas- ing secularization of music. In the sixteenth century it was no
longer re- ligious music that made the advances and experiments; it was
the music of the madrigal and the courts. Side by side with philosophy
and literature, and reflecting the pagan aspect of Renaissance art and
the relaxation of morals, the music of sixteenth-century Italy escaped
frorp ecclesiastical control, and sought inspiration in the poetry of
love; the old conflict be- tween religion and sex was resolved for a
time in the triumph of Eros. The reign of the Virgin ended, the
ascendancy of woman began. But under either rule music was the handmaid
of the queen.</p>

<li>PERSPECTIVE</li>
</ol>
<p>Were the morals of Renaissance Italy really worse than those of other
lands or times? It is difficult to make comparisons, since all evidence
is a selection. The age of Alcibiades in Athens displayed much of the
im- morality of the Renaissance in sexual relations and political
chicanery; it too practised abortion on a large scale, and cultivated
erudite courtesans; it too liberated simultaneously the intellect and
the instincts; and, antici- pating Machiavelli, Sophists like
Thrasybulus in Plato’s Republic attacked morality as weakness. Perhaps
(for in these matters we are limited to vague impressions) there was
less private violence in classic Greece than in Renaissance Italy, and a
bit less of corruption in religion and politics. Dur- ing an entire
century of Roman history — from Caesar to Nero — we find</p>
<p>606 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXgreater corruption in government, and a worse breakdown of
marriage, than in the Renaissance; but even in that epoch there remained
many Stoic virtues in the Roman character; Caesar, with all his
ambivalent capacity in bribery and love, was still the greatest general
in a nation of generals.</p>
<p>The individualism of the Renaissance was another side of its
intellectual vivacity, but compares unfavorably, in morals and politics,
with the com- munal spirit of the Middle Ages. Political deceit,
treachery, and crime were probably as rife in France, Germany, and
England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as in Italy, but those
countries had the wisdom not to produce a Machiavelli to expound and
expose the principles of their statecraft. Manners, not morals, were
coarser north of the Alps than below them, except for a small class in
France — exemplified by the Chevalier Bayard and Gaston de Foix — which
still retained the better side of chivalry. Given equal opportunity, the
French were as adept at adultery as the Italians; observe how readily
they adopted syphilis; note the sexual melee in the fabliaux; count the
twenty-four mistresses of Duke Philip of Bur- gundy, and the Agnes
Sorels and Dianes de Poitiers of the French kings; read Brantome.</p>
<p>Germany and England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were
too poor to rival Italy in immorality. Travelers from these countries
were therefore astounded by the laxity of Italian life. Luther, visiting
Italy in 1 51 1, concluded that “if ther e is a hell, then Rome is built
upon it; and this I have heard in Rome itself.” 111 Everyone knows the
shocked judg - ment of Roger Ascham, the English scholar who visited
Italy about 1550:</p>
<p>I was once in Italy myself; but I thank God my abode there was</p>
<p>but nine days; and yet I saw in that little time, in one city, more
lib-</p>
<p>erty to sin than ever I heard tell in our noble city of London in
nine</p>
<p>years. I saw it was there as free to sin, not only without all
punish-</p>
<p>ment but also without any man’s marki ng, as it is free in the city
of</p>
<p>London to choose without all blame whether a man lust to wear shoe or
pantocle. 112</p>
<p>And he quotes as an established proverb the saying, Ingle se
Italianato e un diavolo incamato : “An Englishman Italianate is a devil
incarnate.”</p>
<p>We know the corruption of Italy better than that of transalpine
Europe because we know more about Italy, and because the Italian laity
made little effort to conceal its immorality, and sometimes wrote books
defend- ing it. However, Machiavelli, who wrote such a book, reckoned
Italy as</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) THE MORAL RELEASE 607</p>
<p>“more corrupt than all other countries; next come the French and the
Spaniards”; 113 he admired the Germans and the Swiss as still possessing
many of the virile virtues of ancient Rome. We may diffidently conclude
that Italy was more immoral because she was richer, weaker in government
and the reign of law, and further advanced in that intellectual
development which usually makes for a moral release.</p>
<p>The Italians made some laudable efforts to check license. The vainest
of these efforts were the sumptuary regulations that in nearly every
state forbade extravagance of immodesty of dress; the vanity of men and
women overrode with sly persistence the occasional assiduity of the law.
The popes inveighed against immorality, but were in some cases swept
along with the stream; their attempts at reforming abuses in the Church
were nullified by the inertia or vested interests of the clergy; they
themselves were rarely as wicked as passionate history once painted
them, but they were more concerned to re-establish the political power
of the papacy than to restore the moral integrity of the Church. “In our
corrupt times,” said Guicciardini, “the goodness of a pontiff is c
ommended when it does not surpass the wickedness of other men .” 114
Valiant attempts at reform were</p>
<p>Even these powerful preachers failed. The instincts formed through a
hundred thousand years of hunting and savagery had re-emerged through
the cracked shell of a morality that had lost the support of religious
belief, of respected authority, and established law. The great Church
that had once ruled kings could no longer govern or cleanse itself. The
destruction of political liberty in state after state had dulled the
civic sense that had enfranchised and ennobled the medieval communes;
where there had been citizens there were now only individuals. Excluded
from government and flush with wealth, men turned to the pursuit of
pleasure, and foreign in- vasion surprised them in siren arms. The
city-states had for two centuries directed their forces, their subtlety,
and their treachery against one an- other; it was now impossible for
them to unite against a common foe. Preachers like Savonarola, rebuffed
in all pleas for reform, called down the</p>
<p>608 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXjudgment of heaven upon Italy, and predicted the destruction of
Rome and the break-up of the Church . 115 France, Spain, and Germany,
weary of sending tribute to finance the wars of the Papal States and the
luxuries of Italian life, looked with amazement and envy at a peninsula
so shorn of will and power, so inviting in beauty and wealth. The birds
of prey gath- ered to feast on Italy.</p>
