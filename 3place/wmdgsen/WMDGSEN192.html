<h4 id="chapter-viii">CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<p>Literature Under the Revolution</p>
<p>I45-3O B.C.</p>
<p>I. LUCRETIUS</p>
<p>AMID this turbulent transformation of economy, government, and</p>
<p>lx . morals, literature was not forgotten, and did not quite escape
the fever and stimulus of the age. V arro and Nepos found safety in
antiquarian scholar- ship or historical research; Sallust retired from
his campaigns to defend his party and disguise his morals with brilliant
monographs; Caesar stooped from empire to grammar and continued his wars
in his Commentaries; Catul- lus and Calvus sought refuge from politics
in the pursuit and poetry of love; timid and sensitive spirits like
Lucretius hid themselves in the gardens of philosophy; and Cicero
retreated now and then from the heat of the Forum to cool his blood with
books. But not one of them found peace. War and revolution touched them
with pervasive infection; and even Lucretius must have known the
restlessness which he describes:</p>
<p>There is a weight on their minds, and a mountain of misery lies
on</p>
<p>their hearts. . . . For each, not knowing what he wants, seeks always
to change his place, as if he could drop his burden. Here is one who,
bored to death at home, goes forth every now and then from his</p>
<p>palace; but feeling no better abroad, suddenly returns. Off he</p>
<p>courses, driving his nags to his country house in headlong haste. . .
.</p>
<p>He has hardly crossed the threshold when he yawns, or seeks oblivion
in a heavy sleep, or even hurries back to the city. So each man
flees</p>
<p>from himself; but, as one might expect, the self which he cannot</p>
<p>escape cleaves to him all the more against his will. He hates himself
because, a sick man, he does not know the cause of his - complaint.</p>
<p>Any man who could see that clearly would cast aside his business,</p>
<p>and before all else would seek to understand the nature of things.
1</p>
<p>His poem is our only biography of Titus Lucretius Carus; it is
proudly reticent about its author; and outside of it, barring a few
allusions, Roman literature is strangely silent about one of its
greatest men. Tradition placed his birth at 99 or 95, his death at 55 or
51, b.c. He lived through half a century of the Roman revolution:
through the Social War, Marian massacres,</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>CHAP.VIIl) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION I47</p>
<p>and Sullan proscriptions; thro ugh Catiline’s conspiracy and Caesar’s
con - sulate. The aristocracy to which he probably belonged was in
obvious decay; the world in which he lived was falling apart into a
chaos that left no life or fortune secure. His poem is a longing for
physical and mental peace.</p>
<p>Lucretius sought refuge in nature, philosophy, and poetry. Perhaps
also he had a round of love; he must have fared badly, for he writes
ungallantly of women, denounces the lure of beauty, and advises itching
youth to appease the flesh with calm promiscuity . 2 In woods and
fields, in plants and animals, m mountain, river, and sea, he found a
delight only rivaled by his passion for philosophy. He was as
impressionable as Wordsworth, as keen of sense as Keats, as prone as
Shelley to find metaphysics in a pebble or a leaf. Nothing of nature’s
loveliness or terror was lost upon him; he was stirred by the forms and
sounds, odors and savors, of things; felt the silences of secret haunts,
the quiet falling of the night, the lazy waking of the day. Everything
natural was a marvel to him — the patient flow of water, the sprouting
of seeds, the endless changes of the sky, the imperturbable persistence
of the stars. He observed animals with curiosity and sympathy, loved
their forms of strength or grace, felt their sufferings, and wondered at
their wordless philosophy. No poet before him had so expressed the
grandeur of the world in its detailed variety and its congregated power.
Here at last nature won the citadels of literature, and rewarded her
poet with a force of descriptive speech that only Homer and Shakespeare
have surpassed.</p>
<p>So responsive a spirit must have been deeply moved in youth by the
mystery and pageantry of religion. But the ancient faith, which had once
served family discipline and social order, had lost its hold on the
educated classes of Rome. Caesar smiled indulgently as he played
pontifex maximus, and the banquets of the priests were the holydays of
Roman epicures. A small minority of the people were open atheists; now
and then some Roman Alcibiades noctumally mutilated the statues of the
gods . 3 No longer inspired or consoled by the official ritual, many
among the lower classes were flocking to the bloodstained shrines of the
Phrygian Great Mother, or the Cappa- docian goddess Ma, or some of the
Oriental deities that had entered Italy with soldiers or captives from
the East. Under the influence of Greek or Asiatic cults the old Roman
idea of “Orcus” as a colorless subterranean abode of all the
indiscriminate dead had developed into belief in a literal Hell — a
“Tartarus” or “Acheron” of endless suffering for all but a “reborn”
initiated few . 4 The sun and the moon were conceived as gods, and every
eclipse sent terror into lonely villages and teeming tenements. Chaldean
fortunetellers and astrologers were overrunning Italy, casting
horoscopes for paupers and millionaires, revealing hidden treasures and
future events, interpreting omens and dreams with cautious ambiguity and
profitable flattery. Every unusual</p>
<p>148 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>occurrence in nature was examined as the warning of a god. It was
this mass of superstition, ritualism, and hypocrisy that Lucretius knew
as religion.</p>
<p>No wonder that he rebelled against it, and attacked it with all the
ardor of a religious reformer. We may judge from the bitterness of his
resentment the depth of his youthful piety and the distress of his
disillusionment. Seeking for some alternative faith, he passed through
the skepticism of Ennius to the great poem in which Empedocles had
expounded evolution and the con- flict of opposites. When he discovered
the writings of Epicurus it seemed to him that he had found the answers
to his questions; that strange mixture of materialism and free will, of
joyful gods and a godless world, appealed to him as a free man’s answer
to doubt and fear. A breath of liberation from supernatural terrors
seemed to come out of Epicurus’ garden, revealing the omnipresence of
law, the self-ruled independence of nature, the forgivable naturalness
of death. Lucretius resolved to take this philosophy out of the ungainly
prose in which Epicurus had expressed it, fuse it into poetic form, and
offer it to his generation as the way, the truth, and the life. He felt
in himself a rare and double power — the objective perception of the
scientist and the subjective emotion of the poet; and he saw in the
total order of nature a sublimity, and in nature’s parts a beauty, that
encouraged and justified this marriage of philosophy and poetry. His
great purpose aroused all his powers, lifted him to a unique
intellectual exuberance, and left him, before its com- pletion,
exhausted and perhaps insane. But his “long and delightful toil” gave
him a consuming happiness, and he poured into it all the devotion of a
profoundly religious soul.</p>
<p>He chose for his work a philosophical rather than a poetic title — De
Rerum Nature, “On the Nature of Tilings”— a simple translation of the
Peri Physeos (“About Nature”) which the pre -Socratics had used as a
common name for their treatises. He offered it to the sons of Caius
Memmius, praetor in 58, as a road from fear to understanding. He took as
his model the Empedoclean epic of exposition, as his speech the quaint
bluntness of Ennius, as his medium the mobile and versatile hexameter.
And then, for- getting for a moment the distant carelessness of the
gods, he began with a fervent apostrophe to Venus conceived, like
Empedocles’ Love, as a symbol of creative desire and the ways of
peace:</p>
<p>Mother of Aeneas’ race, delight of men and gods, O nurturing</p>
<p>Venus! . . . Through thee every kind of life is conceived and
born,</p>
<p>and looks upon the sun; before thee and thy coming the winds flee,
and the clouds of the sky depart; to thee the miraculous earth lifts up
sweet flowers; for thee the waves of the sea laugh, and the peaceful
heavens shine with overspreading light. For as soon as the springtime
face of day appears, and the fertilizing south wind makes all things</p>
<p>*49</p>
<p>CHAP.Vin) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>fresh and green, then first the birds of the air proclaim thee and
thy advent, O divine one, pierced to the heart by thy power; then
the</p>
<p>wild herds leap over the glad pastures, and cross the swift
streams;</p>
<p>so, held captive by thy charm, each one follows thee wherever thou
goest to lead. Then through seas and mountains and rushing rivers,</p>
<p>and the leafy dwellings of the birds, and the verdant fields,
thou</p>
<p>strikest soft love into the breasts of all creatures, and makest them
to propagate their generations after their kinds. Since, therefore, thou
alone rulest the nature of things; since without thee nothing rises to
the shining shores of light, nothing joyful or lovely is bom; I long for
thee as partner in the writing of these verses. . . . Grant to my</p>
<p>words, O goddess, an undying beauty. Cause, meanwhile, the savage
works of war to sleep and be still. … As Mars reclines upon thy</p>
<p>sacred form, bend thou around him from above, pour sweet coaxings
from thy mouth, and beg for thy Romans the gift of peace . 6</p>
<p>H. DE RERUM NATURA</p>
<p>If we try to reduce to some logical form the passionate disorder
of</p>
<p>Lucretius’ argument, his initial thesis lies in a famous line:</p>
<p>Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum —</p>
<p>“to so many evils religion has persuaded men .” 6 He tells the story
of Iphigenia in Aulis, of countless human sacrifices, of hecatombs
offered to gods conceived in the image of man’s greed; he recalls the
terror of sim - plicity and youth lost in a jungle of vengeful deities,
the fear of lightning and thunder, of death and Hell, and the
subterranean horrors pictured in Etruscan art and Oriental mysteries. He
reproaches mankind for preferring sacrificial ritual to philosophical
understanding:</p>
<p>O miserable race of men, to impute to the gods such acts as
these,</p>
<p>and such bitter wrath! What sorrow did men 〔through such
creeds〕</p>
<p>prepare for themselves, what wounds for us, what tears for our chil-
dren! For piety lies not in being often seen turning a veiled head
to</p>
<p>stones, nor in approaching every altar, nor in lying prostrate . .
.</p>
<p>before the temples of the gods, nor in sprinkling altars with the
blood of beasts . . . but rather in being able to look upon all things
with</p>
<p>amind at peace?</p>
<p>There are gods, says Lucretius, but they dwell far off in happy
isolation from the thought or cares of men. There, “beyond the flaming
ramparts of the world” {extra flammantia moenia jtmndi), 8 beyond the
reach of our sacrifices and prayers, they live like followers of
Epicurus, shunning worldly</p>
<p>Ijo CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>affairs, content with the contemplation of beauty and the practices
of friend- ship and peace . 0 They are not the authors of creation, nor
the causes of events; who would be so unfair as to charge them with the
wastefulness, the disorder, the sufferings, and the injustices of
earthly life? No, this infinite universe of many worlds is
self-contained; it has no law outside itself; nature does everything of
her own accord. “For who is strong enough to rule the sum of things, to
hold in hand the mighty bridle of the unfathomable deep? — who to turn
all the heavens around at once … to shake the serene sky with thunder,
to launch the lightning that often shatters temples, and cast the bolt
that slays the innocent and passes the guilty by?” 10 The only god is
Law; and the truest worship, as well as the only peace, lies in learning
that Law and loving it. “This terror and gloom of the mind must be
dispelled not by the sun’s rays . . . but by the aspect and law of
nature.” 11</p>
<p>And so, “touching with the honey of the Muses” the rough materialism
of Democritus, Lucretius proclaims as his basic theorem that “nothing
exists but atoms and the void” 12 — i.e., matter and space. He proceeds
at once to a cardinal principle (and assumption) of modem science — that
the quantity of matter and motion in the world never varies; no thing
arises out of nothing, and destruction is only a change of form. The
atoms are</p>
<p>indestructible, unchangeable, solid, resilient, soundless, odorless,
tasteless, colorless, infinite. They interpenetrate one another to
produce endless com- binations and qualities; and they move without
cease in the seeming stillness of motionless things.</p>
<p>For often on a hill . . . woolly sheep go creeping wherever the</p>
<p>dew-sparkling grass tempts them, and the well-fed lambs play and</p>
<p>butt their heads in sport; yet in the distance all these are blurred
to- gether and seem but a whiteness resting on a green hill. Sometimes
great armies cover wide fields in maneuvers mimicking war; the bril-
liant bronze of their shields illumines the countryside and is mirrored
in the sky; the ground trembles and thunders under their marching</p>
<p>feet and their galloping steeds; and the mountains, buffeted by
the</p>
<p>sound, hurl it back to the very stars: and yet there is a place on
the</p>
<p>peaks from which these armies appear to be motionless, a little
bright- ness resting on the plain . 18</p>
<p>The atoms * have parts — twithwm, or “least things”— each minimum
being solid, indivisible, ultimate. Perhaps because of the different
arrangement of these parts, the atoms vary in size and shape, and so
make possible the re- freshing diversity of nature. The atoms do not
move in straight or uniform</p>
<p>• Lucretius never uses this word, b ut calk hk primordial panicles
prhnordia, elementa, or sermrn (seeds).</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 1 5 1</p>
<p>lines; there is in their motion an incalculable “declination” or
deviation, an elemental spontaneity that runs through all thin gs and
culminates in man’s free will.*</p>
<p>All was once formless; but the gradual assortment of the moving atoms
by their size and shape produced — without design — air, fire, water,
and earth, and out of these the sun and moon, the planets and stars. In
the infinity of space new worlds are ever being bom, and old worlds are
wasting away. The stars are fires set in the ring of ether (a mist of
thinnest atoms) that surrounds each planetary system; this cosmic wall
of fire constitutes the “flaming ramparts of the world.” A portion of
the primeval mist broke off from the mass, revolved separately, and
cooled to form the earth. Earthquakes are not the growling of deities,
but the expansion of subterranean gases and streams. Thunder and
lightning are not the voice and breath of a god, but natural results of
condensed and clashing clouds. Rain is not the mercy of Jove, but the
return to earth of moisture evaporated from it by the sun.</p>
<p>Life does not differ essentially from other matter; it is a product
of moving atoms which are individually dead. As the universe took form
by the in- herent laws of matter, so the earth produced by a purely
natural selection all the species and organs of life.</p>
<p>Nothing arises in the body in order that we may use it, but what</p>
<p>arises brings forth its own use . 14 … It was no design of the
atoms</p>
<p>that led them to arrange themselves in order with keen intelligence .
. . but because many atoms in infinite time have moved and met in all
manner of ways, trying all combinations. . . . Hence arose the</p>
<p>beginnings of great things . . . and the generations of living
crea-</p>
<p>tures . 16 . . . Many were the monsters that the earth tried to
make:</p>
<p>. . . some without feet, and others without hands or mouth or
face,</p>
<p>or with limbs bound to their frames. … It was in vain; nature</p>
<p>denied them growth, nor could they find food or join in the way
of</p>
<p>love. . . . Many kinds of animals must have perished then, unable</p>
<p>to forge the chain of procreation … for those to which nature
gave</p>
<p>no 〔protective〕 qualities lay at the mercy of others, and were
soon</p>
<p>destroyed . 16</p>
<p>Mind {animus) is an organ precisely like feet or eyes; it is, like
them, a tool or function of that soul {ammo) or vital breath which is
spread as a very fine matter throughout the body, and animates every
part. Upon the highly sensitive atoms that form the mind fall the images
or films that per- petually emanate from the surfaces of things; this is
the source of sensation. Taste, smell, hearing, sight, and touch are
caused by particles coming from</p>
<p>• Cf. the “indeterminacy” ascribed to the electrons by some
physicists of our time.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>objects and striking tongue or palate, nostrils, ears, eyes, or skin;
all senses are forms of touch. The senses are the final test of truth;
if they seem to err, it is only through misinterpretation, and only
another sense can correct them. Reason cannot be the test of truth, for
reason depends upon experience — i.e., sensation.</p>
<p>The soul is neither spiritual nor immortal. It could not move the
body unless it too were corporeal; it grows and ages with the body; it
is affected like the body by disease, medicine, or wine; its atoms are
apparently dis- persed when the body dies. Soul without body would be
senseless, mean- ingless; of what use would soul be without organs of
touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight? Life is given us not in
freehold but on loan, and for so long as we can make use of it. When we
have exhausted our powers we should leave the table of life as
graciously as a grateful guest rising from a feast. Death itself is not
terrible; only our fears of the hereafter make it so. But there is no
hereafter. Hell is here in the suffering that comes from ignorance,
passion, pugnacity, and greed; heaven is here in the sapientum templa
serena — “the serene temples of the wise.” 17</p>
<p>Virtue lies not in the fear of the gods, nor in the timid shunning
of</p>
<p>pleasure; it lies in the harmonious operation of senses and faculties
guided by reason. “Some men wear out their lives for the sake of a
statue and fame”; but “the real wealth of man is to live simply with a
mind at peace” ( vivere parce aequo ammo )} 6 Better than living stiffly
in gilded halls is “to lie in groups upon the soft g rass beside a
rivulet and under tall trees,” 19 or to hear gentle music, or lose one’s
ego in the love and care of our children. Marriage is good, but
passionate love is a madness that strips the mind of clarity and reason.
“If one is wounded by the sha fts of Venus — whether it be a boy with
girlish limbs who launches the shaft, or a woman radiating love from her
whole body — he is drawn toward the source of the blow, and longs to
unite.” 20 No marriage and no society can find a sound basis in such
erot ic befuddlement.</p>
<p>As Lucretius, exhausting his passions on philosophy, finds no room
for romantic love, so he rejects the romantic anthropology of Greek
Rousseau- ians who had glorified primitive life. Men were hardier then,
to be sure; but they dwelt in caves without fire, they mated without
marriage, killed with- out law, and died of starvation as frequently as
people in civilization die of overeating. 21 How civilization developed,
Lucretius tells in a pretty sum- mary of ancient anthropology. Social
organization gave man the power to survive animals far stronger than
himself. He discovered fire from the friction of leaves and boughs,
developed language from gestures, and learned song from the birds; he
tamed animals for his use, and himself with marriage</p>
<p>CHAP.Vin) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 153</p>
<p>and law; he tilled the soil, wove clothing, molded metals into tools;
he observed the heavens, measured time, and learned navigation; he
improved the art of killing, conquered the weak, and built cities and
states. History is a procession of states and civilizations rising,
prospering, decaying, dying; but each in turn transmits the civilizing
heritage of customs, morals, and arts; “like runners in a race they hand
on the lamps of life” (e t quasi cursores vital lampada tradunt) .
22</p>
<p>All things that grow decay: organs, organisms, families, states,
races, planets, stars; only the atoms never die. The forces of creation
and develop- ment are balanced by the forces of destruction in a vast
diastole and systole of life and death. In nature there is evil as well
as good; suffering, even’ un- merited, comes to every life, and
dissolution dogs the steps of every evolu- tion. Our earth itself is
dying: earthquakes are breaking it up. The land is becoming exhausted,
rains and rivers erode it, and carry even the mountains at last into the
sea. Someday our whole stellar system will suffer a like mortality; “the
walls of the sky will be stormed on every side, and will collapse into a
crumbling ruin.” 28 But the very moment of mortality betrays the
invincible vitality of the world. “The wailing of the newborn infant is
mingled with the dirge sung for the dead.” 24 New systems form, new
stars and planets, another earth, and fresher life. Evolution begins
again.</p>
<p>Looking back over this “most marvelous performance in all antique
litera - ture,” 25 we may first recognize its shortcomings: the chaos of
its contents, left unrevised by the poet’s early death; the repetition
of phrases, lines, whole passages; the conception of sun, moon, and
stars as no larger than we see them; 28 the inability of the system to
explain how dead atoms became life and consciousness; the
insensitiveness to the insights, consolations, inspira- tions, and
moving poetry of faith, and the moral and social functions of religion.
But how light these faults are in the scale against the brave attempt at
a rational interpretation of the universe, of history, of religion, of
disease; * the picture of nature as a world of law, in which matter and
motion are never diminished or increased; the grandeur of the theme and
the nobility of its treatment; the sustained power of imagination that
feels everywhere “the majesty of things,” and lifts the visions of
Empedocles, the scie nce of Democritus, and the ethics of Epicurus into
some of the loftiest poetry that any age has known. Here was a language
still rough and immature, almost devoid as yet of philosophical or
scientific terms; Lucretius does not merely create a new vocabulary, he
forces the old speech into new channels of</p>

<p>rhythm and grace; and, while molding the hexameter into an unequaled
masculinity of power, reaches now and then the mellow tenderness and
fluency of Virgil. The sustained vitality of his poem shows Lucretius as
one who amid all sufferings and disappointments enjoyed and exhausted
life almost from birth to death.</p>
<p>How did he die? Saint Jerome reports that “Lucretius was driven mad
by a love philter, after he had written several books. . . . He died by
his own hand in his forty- fourth year.” 28 The story i s
uncorroborated, and has been much doubted; no saint could be trusted to
give an objective account of Lucretius. Some critics have found support
for the story in the unnatural tension of the poem, its poorly organized
contents, and its sudden end; 29 but one need not be a Lucretius to be
excitable, disorderly, or dead.</p>
<p>Like Euripides, Lucretius is a modem; his thought and feeling are
more congenial to our time than to the century before Christ. Horace and
Virgil were deeply influenced by him in their youth, and recall him
without name in many a lordly phrase; but the attempt of Augustus to
restore the old faith made it unwise for these imperial proteges to
express too openly their admiration and their debt. The Epicurean
philosophy was as unsuited to the Roman mind as epicurean practices
suited Roman taste in the age of Lucretius.* Rome wanted a metaphysic
that ^ould exalt mystic powers rather than natural law; an ethic that
would make a virile and martial people rather than humanitarian lovers
of quiet and peace; and a political philosophy that, like those of
Virgil and Horace, would justify Rome’s imperial mastery. In the
resurrection of faith after Seneca, Lucretius was almost forgotten. Not
tillPoggio rediscovered him in 1418 did he begin to influence European
thought. A physician of Verona, Girolamo Fracastoro (1483-1553) took
from the poet the theory of disease as due to noxious “seeds” ( sermna )
float - ing in the air; and in 1647 Gassendi revived the atomic
philosophy. Voltaire read the De Rerum Natura devotedly, and agreed with
Ovid that its rebel verses would last as long as the earth. 80</p>
<p>In the endless struggle of East and West, of “tender - minded” and
con - soling faiths vs. a “tough - minded” and materialistic science,
Lucreti us waged alone the most vigorous battle of his time. He is, of
course, the greatest of philosophical poets. In him, as in Catullus and
Qcero, Latin literature came of age, and leadership in letters passed at
last from Greece to Rome.</p>

<p>CHAP.VIIl) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>1 55</p>
<p>in. lesbia’s lover</p>
<p>In 57 b.c. the Caius Memmius to whom Lucretius dedicated his poem
left Rome to serve as propraetor in Bithynia. After the growing custom
of Roman governors he took with him an author — not Lucretius, but a
poet different from the other in everything but the strength of his
passion. Quintus (or Caius) Valerius Catullus had come to Rome some five
years before from his native Verona, where his father was of sufficient
standing to be frequent host to Caesar. Quintus himself must have had a
substantial competence, for he owned villas near Tibur and on Lake Garda
and had an elegant house in Rome. He speaks of these properties as
choked with mortgages, and re- peatedly proclaims his poverty; but the
picture we form of him from his poems is that of a polished man of the
world who did not bother to earn a living, but enjoyed himself
unstintingly among the wilder set in the capital. The keenest wits, the
cleverest young orators and politicians belonged to this circle: Marcus
Caelius, the impecunious aristocrat who was to become a communist;
Licinius Calvus, brilliant in poetry and in law; and Helvius Cinna, a
poet whom Antony’s mob would mistake for one of Caesar’s assassins and
beat to death. These men opposed Caesar with every epigram at their
disposal, unaware that their literary revolt reflected the revolution in
which they lived. They were tired of old forms in literature, of the
crudity and bombast of Naevius and Ennius; they wished to sing the
sentiments of youth in new and lyric meters, and with a refinement and
delicacy of execution known once in the Alexandria of Callimachus, but
never yet seen in Rome. And they were resentful of old morals, of the
mos maiorum perpetually preached upon them by their exhausted elders;
they announced the sanctity of instinct, the innocence of desire, and
the grandeur of dissipation. They and Catullus were no worse than other
young literary blades of their genera- tion and the next; Horace, Ovid,
Tibullus, Propertius, even the shy Virgil in his youth, made life and
verse revolve around any woman, married or not, who fed their muses with
facile casual love.</p>
<p>The liveliest lady in this group was Clodia, of the proud old
Claudian gens that even now had emperors in its loins.* Apuleius 31
assures us that it was she whom Catullus named Lesbia in memory of the
Sappho whose poems he occasionally translated, often imitated, and
always loved. Arriving in Rome at the age of twenty-two, he cultivated
her friendship while her husband governed Cisalpine Gaul. He was
fascinated the moment she “set her shining foot on the well- worn
threshold”; he called her his “lustrous goddess of the</p>
<p>Cf. p. ijj.</p>

<p>156</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>delicate step”; and indeed a woman’s walk, like her voice, may be in
itself a sufficient seduction. She accepted him graciously as one of her
worshipers; and the enraptured poet, unable to match otherwise the gifts
of his rivals, laid at her feet the most beautiful lyrics in the Latin
tongue. For her he translated perfectly Sappho’s description of the
lover’s frenzy that now raged in him ; 32 and to the sparrow that she
pressed to her bosom he indited a jewel of jealousy:</p>
<p>Sparrow, delight of my beloved,</p>
<p>Who plays with you, and holds you to her breast;</p>
<p>Who offers her forefinger to your seeking,</p>
<p>And tempts your sharp bite;</p>
<p>I know not what dear jest it pleases my shining one</p>
<p>To make of my desire! . . .*</p>
<p>For a while he was consumed with happiness, played attendance upon
her daily, read his poems to her, forgot everything but his
infatuation.</p>
<p>Let us live, Lesbia mine, and love,</p>
<p>And all the mumbling of harsh old men</p>
<p>We shall reckon as a pennyworth.</p>
<p>Suns may sink and return;</p>
<p>For us, when once our brief sun has set,</p>
<p>There comes the long sleep of everlasting night.</p>
<p>Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred,</p>
<p>Then another thousand, then a second hundred,</p>
<p>Then still another thousand, then a hundred.</p>
<p>And when we shall have reached many thousands</p>
<p>We shall confuse the count, lest we should ever know,</p>
<p>Or some mean soul should envy us,</p>
<p>Learning the great sum of our kisses.f</p>

verse. The foregoing is an almost literal translation of</p>

<p>CHAP. VIII ) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 1 57</p>
<p>We do not know how long this ecstasy lasted; probably his thousands
wearied her, and she who had betrayed her husband for him found it a
relief to betray him for another. Her benefactions now ranged so widely
that Catull us madly fancied her “embracing at once three hundred adul -
terers.” 35 In the very heat of his love he came to hate her (odi et amo
30 ) and</p>
<p>A woman’s words to hungry lover said</p>
<p>Should be upon the flowing winds inscribed,</p>
<p>Upon swift streams engraved . 37</p>
<p>When sharp doubt became dull certainty his passion turned to
bitterness and coarse revenge; he accused her of yielding to tavern
habitues, denounced her new lovers with obscene abandon, and meditated
suicide, poetically. At the same time he was capable of nobler feelings:
he addressed to his friend Manlius a touching epithalamium or wedding
song, envying him the whole- some comradeship of marriage, the security
and stability of a home, and the happy tribulations of parentage. He
snatched himself from the scene by accompanying Memmius to Bithynia, but
he was disappointed in his hopes of restoring there his spirits or his
purse. He went out of his way to find the grave of a brother who had
died in the Troad; over it he performed reverently the ancestral burial
rites; and soon afterward he composed tender lines that gave the world a
famous phrase:</p>
<p>Dear brother, through many states and seas</p>
<p>Have I come to this sorrowful sacrifice,</p>
<p>Bringing you the last gift for the dead. . . .</p>
<p>Accept these offerings wet with fraternal tears;</p>
<p>And forever, brother, hail and farewell.*</p>
<p>His sojourn in Asia changed and softened him. The skeptic who had</p>
<p>written of death as “the sleep of an eternal night” was moved by the
old religions and ceremonies of the East. In the rich and flowing verse
of his greatest poem, “Atys,” he described with vivid intensity the
worship of Cybele, and caught an exotic fervor in the lament of the
self-emasculated devotee over the joys and friends of his youth. In
“Peleus and Thetis” he retold the tale of Peleus and Ariadne in
hexameters of such melodious delicacy as even Virgil would hardly equal.
In a small yacht bought at Amastris he sailed through the Black Sea, the
Aegean, and the Adriatic, and</p>

<p>up the Po to Lake Garda and his villa at Sirmio. “Oh, what happier
way is there to escape the cares of the world,” he asked, “than to
return to our own homes and altars, and rest on our own belo ved bed ?”
89 Men begin by seeking happiness and are content at last with
peace.</p>
<p>We know Catullus more intimately than most Roman poets, because his
subject is nearly always himself. These lyric cries of love and hate
reveal a sensitive and kindly spirit, capable of generous feeling even
for relatives, but unpleasantly self-centered, deliberately obscene, and
merciless to his enemies. He published their most private peculiarities,
their pederasdc pro- pensities, their bodily odor. One of them washes
his teeth with urine, after an old Spanish custom ; 40 another is so
foul of breath that if he should open his mouth all persons near him
would fall dead . 41 Catullus oscillates easily between love and offal,
kisses and fundaments; he rivals Martial as a guide to the street-corner
urology of Rome, and suggests in his contemporaries and his class a
mixture of primitive coarseness with civilized refinement, as if
educated Romans, however versed in the literature of Greece, could never
quite forget the stable and the camp. Catullus pleads, like Martial,
that he must salt his lines with dirt to hold his audience.</p>
<p>He atoned for these faults by the conscientious perfection of his
verse. His hendecasyllabics leap with a naturalness and spontaneity that
escape the artifices of Horace and occasionally rise above all the
graces of Virgil. It took much art to conceal his art, and Catullus more
than once refers to the painful toil and care that produced his quick
intelligibility and apparent ease. His vocabulary helped him to this
end; he molded the words of popular speech into poetry, and enriched the
Latin of literature with affectionate diminutives as well as tavern
slang. He avoided inversions and obscurities, and gave to his lines a
limpid fluidity grateful to the ear. He pored over the poets of
Hellenistic Alexandria and ancient Ionia: mastered the smooth technique
and varied meters of Callimachus, the lusty directness of Archil- ochus,
the vinous exuberance of Anacreon, the amorous ecstasy of Sappho;
indeed, it is largely through him that we must guess how these poets
wrote. He learned their lessons so thoroughly that he became, from their
pupil, their equal. He did for Latin poetry what Cicero did for Latin
prose: he took it as crude potency and lifted it to an art that only
Virgil would surpass.</p>

<li>THE SCHOLARS</li>
</ol>
<p>How were Latin books written, illustrated, bound, published, sold?
For school exercises, short letters, transient commercial records, the
Romans through antiquity wrote with a stylus upon waxed tablets and
erased with the thumb.</p>
<p>CHAP.Vin) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 1 59</p>
<p>The oldest literary Latin known to us was written with quill and ink
upon paper manufactured in Egypt from the pressed and glued leaves of
the papyrus tree. In the first centuries of our era parchment made from
the dried skins of animals began to rival papyrus as a receptacle of
literature and important docu- ments. A folded sheet of membrane, or
vellum, constituted a diploma , or two- fold. Usu ally a literary work
was issued as a roll ( volumen, “wound up”), and was read by unrolling
as the reading progressed. The text was customarily written two or three
narrow columnae to a page, often without punctuation of clauses or even
separation of words. Some manuscripts were illustrated by ink drawings;
Varro’s Imagines , e.g., consisted of 700 portraits of famous men,
each</p>
<p>Stimulated by these facilities, Roman literature and scholarship
began to equal the industry of the Alexandrians. Poems, pamphlets,
histories, textbooks rivaled the Tiber’s floods; every aristocrat
adorned his escapades with verse, every lady composed words and music,
every general wrote memoirs. It was an age of “outlines”; summaries on
every subject struggled to meet the needs of a hurried commercial age.
Marcus Terentius Varro, despite many military campaigns, found time
during his eighty-nine years (116-26 b.c.) to synopsize nearly every
branch of knowledge; his 620 “volumes” (some seventy -four books)
constituted a one-man encyclopedia for his time. Fascinated by the
pedigrees of words, he wrote an essay On the Latin Language , now our
chief guide to early Roman speech. Perhaps in co-operation with the aims
of Augustus, he tried in his treatise On Country Life ( De Re Rustica ,
36 b.c.) to encourage a return to the land as the best refuge from the
disorder of civil strife. “My eightieth year,” said his introduction,
“warns me that I must pack up and prepare to leave this life”; 42 he
would make his last testament a guide to rural happiness and peace. He
admired the sturdy women who were delivered of children in the fields
and soon resumed work. 43 He mourned the low native birth rate that was
transforming the popula- tion of Rome; “formerly the blessing of
children was woman’s pride; now she boasts with Ennius that she ‘would
rather face battle three times than bear one child.’” In his Divine
Antiquities he concluded that the fertility, order, and courage of a
nation require moral commandments supported by religious belief.
Adopting the distinction of the great jurist Q. Mucius Scaevola between
two kinds of religion — one for philosophers and one for the people 44 —
he argued that</p>
<p>I&lt;So CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>the second must be upheld regardless of its intellectual defects; and
though he himself accepted only a vague pantheism,* he proposed a
vigorous attempt to restore the worship of Rome’s ancient deities.
Influenced by Cato and Polybius, he in his turn decisively affected the
religious policy of Augustus and the pious ruralism of Virgil.</p>
<p>As if to complete the work of the elder Cato in every field, Varro
continued the censor’s Origines in his Life of the Roman People— a.
history of Roman civil- ization. It is a pity that time has scuttled
this and nearly all of Varro’s work, while preserving the schoolboy
biographies of Cornelius Nepos. In Rome history was an art, never also a
science; not even in Tacitus did it rise to a critical s crutiny and
summary of sources. History as rhetoric, however, found in this age a
bril- liant practitioner — Caius Sallustius Crispus (86-35 B - c - ) •
He played a vigorous role as politician and warrior on Caesar’s side,
governed Numidia, stole with ski ll, and spent a fortune on women; then
he retired to a life of luxury and letters in a Roman villa that became
famous for its gardens and was to be the home of emperors. His books,
like politics, were a continuation of war by other means; his Histories,
Jugurthine War, and Catiline were able defenses of the populates,
powerful attacks upon the “old guard.” He exposed the moral decay of
Rome,f charged the Senate and the courts with placing property rights
above human rights, and put into the mouth of Marius a speech asserting
the natural equality of all classes and demanding a career open to
talent wherever bom. 40 He deepened his narratives with philosophical
commentary and psychological analysis of char- acter, and carved out a
style of epigrammatic compactness and vivid rapidity which became a
model for Tacitus.</p>
<p>That style, like almost all Roman prose of Sallust’s century and the
next, took its color and tone from the oratory of the Forum and the
courts. The develop- ment of the legal profession, and the growth of a
talkative democracy, had widened the demand for public speaking. Schools
of rhetoric were multiplying despite governmental hostility;
“rhetoricians,” said Cicero, “are everywhere.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>• ‘The soul of the world is God, and its parts are the true
divinities.’* t Varro claims that Sallust “was taken in adultery by
Annius Milo, soundly beaten with thongs, and permitted to escape only
after paying a sum of money”; 40tt but this, too, may be politics.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII ) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION l6l</p>
<p>was through oratory that the Latin language reached its full height
of colorful eloquence, masculine power, and almost Oriental grace.
Indeed, the younger orators who came after Hortensius and Cicero
condemned the luxurious adorn- ment and passionate turbulence of what
they called the “Asianic” style; and Caesar, Calvus, Brutus, and Pollio
pledged themselves to a calmer, chaster, sparer “Attic” speech. Here, so
long ago, the battle lines formed between “romanticism” and
“classicism”— between the emotional and the intellectual view of life
and domination of style. Even in oratory, the young classicists
complained, the East was conquering Rome.</p>
<p>V. CICERO’S PEN</p>
<p>Proud of his speeches, and aware that they were making literature,
Cicero felt keenly the criticism of the “Attic” school, and defended
himself in a long series of treatises on oratorical art. In lively
dialogues he sketched the history of Roman eloquence and laid down the
rules for composition, prose rhythm, and delivery. He did not admit that
his own style was “Asian”; he had modeled it, he claimed, upon that of
Demosthenes; and he reminded the Atticists that their cold and
passionless speech drove audiences to sleep or flight.</p>
<p>The fifty-seven orations that have come down to us from Cicero
illustrate all the tricks of successful eloquence. They excel in the
passionate presenta- tion of one side of a question or a character, the
entertainment of the auditors with humor and anecdote, the appeal to
vanity, prejudice, sentiment, patriot- ism, and piety, the ruthless
exposure of the real or reported, public or private, faults of the
opponent or his client, the skillful turning of attention from
unfavorable points,, the barrage of rhetorical questions framed to make
answer difficult or damaging, the heaping up of charges, in periodic
sen- tences whose clauses are lashes, and whose torrent overwhelms.
These speeches do not pretend to be fair; they are defamations rather
than declama- tions, briefs that take every advantage of that freedom of
abuse which, though forbidden to the stage, was allowed in the Forum and
the courts. Cicero does not hesita te to apply to his victims terms like
“swine,” “pest,” “butcher,” “filth”; he tells Piso that virgins kill
themselves to escape his lechery, and excoriates Antony for being
publicly affectionate to his wife. Audiences and juries enjoyed such
vituperation, and no one took it too seriously. Cicero corresponded
amiably with Piso a few years after the brutal attack of the In Pisonem.
It is to be admitted, further, that Cicero’s orations abound rather in
egotism and rhetoric than in moral sincerity, philosophical wisdom, or
even legal acumen or depth. But what eloquence! Even Demos- thenes was
not so vivid, vital, exuberantly witty, so full of the salt and tang of
the human fray. Certainly no man before or after Gcero spoke a Latin
so</p>
<p>1 62 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>seductively charming and fluent, so elegantly passionate; this was
the zenith of Latin prose. “You have discovered all the treasures of
oratory,” said the generous Caesar in dedicating his book On Analogy to
Cicero; “and you have been the first to employ them. Thereby you have
laid the Roman people under a mighty obligation, and you honor your
fatherland. You have gained a triumph to be preferred to that of the
greatest generals. For it is a nobler thing to enlarge the boundaries of
human intelligence than those of the Roman Empire.” 47</p>
<p>The speeches betray the politician; the letters of Cicero bare the
man, and make even the politician forgivable. Nearly all of them were
dictated to a secretary and never revised by Cicero; most of them were
written with no thought of publication; seldom, therefore, has a man’s
secret soul been so completely exposed. “He who reads these letters,”
said Nepos, “will not much need a history of those times”; 48 in them
the most vital part of the revolutionary drama is seen from within, all
blinds removed. Usually their style is artless and direct and dances
with humor and wit; 40 their language is an attractive mixture of
literary grace and colloquial ease. They are the most interesting of Ci
cero’s remains; indeed, of all extant Latin prose. It is natural that we
should find in so large a correspondence (864 letters, ninety of them to
Cicero) occasional contradictions and insincerities. There is no sign
here of the religious piety and belief that appear so frequently in
Cicero’s essays or in those speeches in which he plays up the gods as
his last trump. His private opinion of various men, especially of
Caesar, does not always conform with his public protestation. 00 His
incredible vanity ap- pears more amiably here than in his orations,
where he seems to be carrying his own statue with him wherever he goes;
he smilingly confesses that “my own applause has the greatest weight
with me.” 81 Fie assures us, with charm - ing innocence, that “if ever
any man was a stranger to vainglory it is my - self.” 52 We are amused
to find so many letters about money and so much ado about so many homes.
Besides modest villas at Arpinum, Asturae, Puteoli, and Pompeii, Cicero
had an estate at Formiae valued at 250,000, another at Tusculum worth
500,000, and a palace on the Palatine that cost him 3,500,000
sesterces.* Such comfort seems outrageous in a philosopher.</p>
<p>But which of us is so virtuous that his reputation could survive the
publi- cation of his intimate correspondence? Indeed, as we continue to
read these letters, we almost come to like the man. He had no more
faults, perhaps no</p>

<p>CHAP. VIII ) LITERATURE UNDER THE REVOLUTION 163</p>
<p>greater vanity, than we; he made the mistake of immortalizing them
with perfect prose. At his best he was a hard worker, a tender father, a
good friend. We see him in his home, loving his books and his children,
and trying to love his wife, the rheumatic and irritable Terentia, whose
wealth and eloquence equaled his own. They were too rich to be happy;
their worries and quarrels were always in large figures; at last, in
their old age, he divorced her over some financial dispute. Soon
afterward he married Publilia, who attracted him by having more money
than years; but when she showed dis- like for his daughter Tullia he
sent Publilia away, too. Tullia he loved hu- manly beyond reason; he
grieved almost to madness at her death and wished to build a temple to
her as a deity. Pleasanter are the letters to and about Tiro, his chief
secretary, who took his dictation in shorthand and managed his finances
so ably and honestly that Cicero rewarded him with freedom. Most
numerous are the letters to Atticus, who invested Cicero’s savings,
extricated him from financial difficulties, published his writings, and
gave him excellent unheeded advice. To Atticus, wisely absent in Greece
at the height of the revolution, Cicero writes a letter of typical
cordiality and charm:</p>
<p>There is nothing of which I so much feel the want as of him with</p>
<p>whom I can communicate everything that concerns me; who loves me, who
is prudent; to whom I can speak without flattery, dissimulation, or
reserve. My brother, who is all candor and kindness, is away. . . .</p>
<p>And you, who have so often relieved my cares and anxieties by your
counsel, who used to be my companion in public matters, my confi- dant
in all private ones, the partaker of all my words and thoughts — where
are you ? 84</p>
<p>In those turbulent days when Caesar crossed the Rubicon, conquered
Pompey, and made himself dictator, Cicero retired for a moment from
politi- cal life and sought solace in reading and writing philosophy.
“Remember,” he begged Atticus, “not to give up your books to anybody,
but to keep them, as you promised, for me. I entertain the strongest
affection for them, as I now feel disgust for everything else .” 88 In h
is youth, defending the poet Archias in the most modest and amiable of
his speeches, he had praised the study of literature as “nourishing our
adolescence, adorning our prosperity, and delighting our old age .” 86
Now he took his own counsel, and in lit tle more than two years wrote
almost a library of philosophy.* The dissolution of religious belief in
the higher classes had left a moral vacuum, by which Rome seemed to be
drawn into a disintegration of character and society.</p>

<p>Cicero dreamed that philosophy might serve as a substitute for
theology in providing for these classes a guide and stimulus to right
living. He resolved not to construct one more system, but to summarize
the teachings of the Greek sages and offer them as his last gift to his
people . 57 He was honest enough to confess that he was for the most
part adapting, sometimes trans- lating, the treatises of Panaedus,
Poseidonius, and other recent Greeks . 58 But he transformed the dull
prose of his models into limpid and graceful Latin, enlivened his
discourse with dialogue, and passed quickly over the deserts of logic
and metaphysics to the living problems of conduct and statesmanship.
Like Lucretius he had to invent a philosophical terminology; he
succeeded, and put both language and philosophy heavily in his debt. Not
since Plato had wisdom worn such prose.</p>
<p>It was from Plato above all that his ideas stemmed. He did not relish
the dog- matism of the Epicureans, who “talk of divine things with such
assurance that</p>

<p>and could not safely let it die. (The emperors would reason so in
persecuting Christianity.) When his beloved Tullia died, Cicero inclined
more strongly than ever to the hope of personal immortality. Many years
before, in the “Dream of Scipio” with which he ended his Republic y he
had borrowed from Pythagoras, Plato, and Eudoxus a complex and eloquent
myth of a life beyond the grave, in which the good great dead enjoyed
eternal bliss. But in his private correspond- ence-even in the letters
that condoled with bereaved friends — there is no men- tion of an
afterlife.</p>
<p>Knowing the; skepticism of his age, he based his moral and political
treatises on purely secular grounds, independent of supernatural
sanctions. He begins (in De Finibus) by inquiring for the road to
happiness, and hesitantly agrees with the Stoics that virtue alone
suffices. Therefore (in De Officiis) he examines the way of virtue, and
by the charm of his style succeeds for a time in making duty
interesting. “All men are brothers,” he writes, and “the whole world is
to be considered as the common city of gods and men.” 66 The most
perfect morality would be a conscientious loyalty to this whole. More
immediately a man owes it to himself and society, first of all, to
establish a sound economic basis to his life, and then to fulfill his
duties as a citizen. Wise statesmanship is nobler than the subtlest
philosophy . 07</p>
<p>Monarchy is the best form of government when the monarch is good, the
worst when he is bad — a truism soon to be illustrated in Rome.
Aristocracy is good when the really best rule; but Cicero, as a member
of the middle class, could not quite admit that the old entrenched
families were the best. Democracy is good when the people are virtuous,
which, Cicero thought, is never; besides, it is vitiated by the false
assumption of equality. The best form of government is a mixed
constitution, like that of pre-Gracchan Rome: die democratic power of
the assemblies, the aristocratic power of the Senate, the almost royal
power of the consuls for a year. Without checks and balances monarchy
becomes despotism, aristocracy becomes oligarchy, democracy becomes mob
rule, chaos, and d ictatorship. Writing five years after Caesar’s
consulate, Cicero cast a dart</p>
<p>Plato says that from the exaggerated license which people call</p>
<p>liberty, tyrants spring up as from a root . . . and that at last such

into its opposite. … For out of such an ungovemed populace one is</p>

<p>who curries favor with the people by giving them other men’s prop -
erty. To such a man, because he has much reason for fear if he remains a
private citizen, the protection of public office is given, and continu-
ally renewed. He surrounds himself with an armed guard, and emerges as a
tyrant over the very people who raised him to power . 08</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Caesar won; and Cicero thought it best to bury his
discontent in melodious platitudes on law, friendship, glory, and old
age. Silent leges inter</p>

<p>All in all, Cicero’s essays in philosophy are meager in result . Like
his states- manship they clung too anxiously to orthodoxy and tradition.
He had all the curiosity of a scientist and all the timidity of a
bourgeois; even in his philosophy he remained a politician, reluctant to
offend any vote. He col- lected the ideas of others, and balanced pros
and cons so well that we come out from his sessions by the same door
wherein we went. Only one thing redeems these little books — the simple
beauty of their style. How pleasant Cicero’s Latin is, how easy to read,
ho w smoothly and clearly the stream of language flows! When he narrates
events he catches some of the vivacity that made his speeches chain
attention; when he describes a character it is with such skill that he
mourns that he has no time to be Rome’s grea test historian ; 74 when he
lets himself go he flowers into the balanced clauses and crashing
periods which he had learned from Isocrates, and with which he had made
the Forum resound. His ideas are those of the upper classes, but his
style aims to reach the people; for them he labors to be clear, toils to
make his truisms thrilling, and salts abstractions with anecdote and
wit.</p>
<p>He re-created the Latin language. He extended its vocabulary, forged
from it a flexible instrument for philosophy, fitted it to be the
vehicle of learning and literature in western Europe for seventeen
hundred years. Posterity remembered him more as an author than as a
statesman. When, despite all his reminders, men had almost forgotten the
glory of his consulate, they cherished his conquests in letters and
eloquence. And since the world honors form as well as substance, art as
well as knowledge and power, he achieved, of all Romans, a fame second
only to Caesar’s. It was an exception that he could never forgive.</p>
