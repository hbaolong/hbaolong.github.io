<h4 id="chapter-xvii-russian-interlude">CHAPTER XVII Russian
Interlude</h4>
<p>1725-62</p>
<p>I. WORK AND RULE</p>
<p>F REDERICK the Great wrote, about 1776: “Of all the neighbors of</p>
<p>Prussia, Russia merits most attention, as being the most dangerous;
it is powerful and near. Those who in the future will govern Prussia
will, like me, be forced to cultivate the friendship of these
barbarians.” 1</p>
<p>Always, in thinking of Russia, we must remember its size. Under Cath-
erine II it included Esthonia, Livonia, Finland (in part), European
Russia, the northern Caucasus, and Siberia. Its area expanded from
687,000 to 913,- 000 square kilometers in the eighteenth century; its
population grew from thirteen millions in 1722 to thirty-six millions in
1790. 2 Voltaire in 1747 estimated the population of France or Germany
to be slightly greater than that of Russia, but he noted that Russia was
three times larger than either of those states. Time and Russian loins
would fill those vast spaces.</p>
<p>In 1722, 97.7 per cent of the Russian population was rural; in 1790,
still</p>
<p>96.4 per cent; so slow was industrialization. In 1762 all but ten per
cent of the people were peasants, and 52.4 per cent of these were serfs.
3 Half of the land was owned by some 100,000 nobles, most of the rest by
the state or the Russian Orthodox Church, some by semifree peasants
still owing services and obedience to local lords. A landlord’s wealth
was reckoned by the num - ber of his serfs; so Count Peter Cheremetyev
was 140,000 serfs rich. 4 The 992,000 serfs of the Church were a main
part of her wealth, and 2,800,000 serfs tilled the lands of the Crown in
1762.®</p>
<p>The noble provided military leadership and economic organization; he
was usually exempt from military service, but often offered it in hopes
of favors from the government. He had judiciary rights over his serfs,
he could punish them, sell them, or banish them to Siberia; normally,
however, he allowed his peasants to govern their internal affairs
through their village assembly, or mir. He was obliged by law to provide
seed for his serfs, and to maintain them through periods of dearth. A
serf might achieve freedom by buying it from his owner or by enlisting
in the army; but this required his owner’s consent. Free peasants could
buy and own serfs; some of these free - men, called kulaki (fists),
dominated village affairs, lent money at usurious rates, and exceeded
the lords in exploitation and severity. 6 Master and man alike were a
tough breed, strong in frame and arm and hand; they were en- gaged
together in the conquest of the soil, and the discipline of the seasons
lay heavy upon them both. Sometimes the hardships were beyond bearing.

<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>RUSSIAN INTERLUDE</p>
<p>4 2 3</p>
<p>peatedly we hear of serfs in great number deserting their farms and
losing themselves in Poland or the Urals or the Caucasus; thousands of
them died on the way, thousands were hunted and captured by soldiery.
Every now and then peasants rose in armed revolt against masters and
government, and gave desperate battle to the troops. Always they were
defeated, and the survivors crept back to their tasks of fertilizing the
women with their seed and the soil with their blood.</p>
<p>Some serfs were trained to arts and crafts, and supplied nearly all
the needs of their masters. At a feast given to Catherine II (the Comte
de Segur tells us) the poet and the composer of the opera, the architect
who had built the auditorium, the painter who decorated it, the actors
and actresses in the drama, the dancers in the ballet, and the musicians
in the orchestra were all serfs of Count Cheremetyev. 7 In the long
winter the peasants made the cloth- ing and the tools they would need in
the coming year. Town industry was slow in developing, partly because
every home was a shop, and partly be- cause difficulties of
transportation usually limited the market to the pro- ducer’s vicinity.
The government encouraged industrial enterprises by offer - ing
monopolies to favorites, sometimes by providing capital, and it approved
participation by nobles in industry and trade. An incipient capitalism
ap- peared in mining, metallurgy, and munitions, and in factory
production of textiles, lumber, sugar, and glass. Entrepreneurs were
permitted to buy serfs to man their factories; su ch “possessional
peasants,” however, were bound not to the owner but to the enterprise; a
governmental decree of 1736 required them, and their descendants, to
remain in their respective factories until officially permitted to
leave. In many cases they lived in barracks, often isolated from their
families. 8 Hours of labor ran from eleven to fifteen per day for men,
with an hour for lunch. Wages ranged from four to eight rubles per day
for men, from two to three rubles for women; but some employers gave
their workers food and lodging, and paid their taxes for them. After
1734 “free”— non-serf — labor increased in the factories, as giving more
stim- ulus to the workers and more profits to the employer. Labor was
too cheap to favor the invention or application of machinery; but in
1748 Pulzunov used a steam engine in his ironworks in the Urals. 9</p>
<p>Between the nobles and the peasants a small and politically powerless
middle class slowly took form. In 1725 some three per cent of the
population were merchants: tradesmen in the villages and towns and at
the fairs; im- porters of tea and silk from China, of sugar, coffee,
spices, and drugs from overseas, and of the finer textiles, pottery, and
paper from Western Europe; exporters of timber, turpentine, pitch,
tallow, flax, and hemp. Caravans moved to China via Siberian or Caspian
routes; ships went out from Riga, Revel, Narva, and St. Petersburg.
Probably more traffic went on the rivers and canals than on the roads or
the sea.</p>
<p>At the center of that internal commerce was Moscow. Physically it was
the largest city in Europe, with long, broad streets, 484 churches, a
hundred palaces, thousands of hovels, and a population of 277,535 in
1780; 10 here Russians, Frenchmen, Germans, Greeks, Italians, English,
Dutch, and Asi-</p>
<p>4 2 4 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>atics talked their own languages and freely worshiped their own gods.
St. Petersburg was the citadel of government, of a Frenchified
aristocracy, of literature and art; Moscow was the hub of religion and
commerce, of a half- Oriental, still-medieval life, and of a jealously
and conscientiously Slavic patriotism. These were the rival foci around
which Russian civilization re- volved, sometimes tearing the nation in
two like a dividing cell, sometimes making it the tense complexity that
would, before the end of the century, be- come the terror and arbiter of
Europe.</p>
<p>It was impossible that a people so used up and brutalized by the
conflict with nature, so lacking in facilities of communication or in
security of life, with so little opportunity for education and so little
time for thought, should enjoy, except in the isolated villages, the
privileges and perils of democracy. Some form of feudalism was
inevitable in the economy, some mode of monarchy in central rule. It was
to be expected that the monarchy would be subject to frequent overturns
by noble factions controlling their own mili- tary support; that the
monarchy should seek to make itself absolute; and that it should depend
upon religion to help its soldiery, police, and judiciary to maintain
social stability and internal peace.</p>
<p>Corruption clogged every avenue of administration. Even the wealthy
nobles who surrounded the thro ne were amenable to “gifts.” “If there be
a Russian proof against flattery,” said the almost contemporary Castera,
“there is not one who can resist the temptation of gold.” 11 Nobles
controlled the palace guard that made and unmade “sovereigns”; they fo
rmed a caste of officers in the army; they manned the Senate which,
under Elizabeth, made the laws; they headed the collegia, or ministries,
that ruled over foreign rela- tions, the courts, industry, commerce, and
finance; they appointed the clerks who carried on the bureaucracy; they
guided the ruler’s choice of the gov - ernors who managed the
“guberniyas” into which the empire was divided, and (after 1761) they
chose the voevodi who governed the provinces. Over all branches of the
government loomed the mostly middle-class Fiscal, a federal bureau of
intelligence, authorized to discover and punish peculation; but, despite
its large use of informers, it found itself foiled, for if the mon- arch
had dismissed every official guilty of venality the machinery of the
state would have stopped. The tax collectors had such sticky fingers
that scarcely a third of their gleanings reached the treasury. 12</p>

<li>RELIGION AND CULTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Religion was especially strong in Russia, for poverty was bitter, and
mer- chants of hope found many purchasers. Skepticism was confined to an
upper class that could read French, and Freemasonry had many converts
there. 13 But the rural, and most of the urban, population lived in a
supernatural world of fearful piety, surrounded by devils, crossing
themselves a dozen times a day, imploring the intercession of saints,
worshiping relics, awed by miracles, trembling over portents,
prostrating themselves before holy images, and moaning somber hymns from
stentorian breasts. Church bells were immense</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) RUSSIAN INTERLUDE 425</p>
<p>and powerful; Boris Godunov had set up one of 288,000 pounds, but the
Empress Anna Ivanovna outrang him by having one cast of 432,000 pounds.
14 The churches were filled; the ritual was more solemn here, and the
prayers were more ecstatic, than in half-pagan papal Rome. The Russian
priests — each of them a papa , or pope — wore awesome beards and
flowing hair, and dark robes reaching to their feet (for legs are an
impediment to dignity). They seldom mingled with the aristocracy or the
court, but lived in modest simplic- ity, celibate in their monasteries
or married in their rectories. Abbots and priors governed the monks,
abbesses the nuns; the secular clergy submitted to bishops, these to
archbishops, these to provincial metropolitans, these to the patriarch
in Moscow; and the Church as a whole acknowledged the secular sovereign
as its head. Outside the Church were dozens of religious sects, rivaling
one another in mysticism, piety, and hate.</p>
<p>Religion served to transmit a moral code that barely availed to
create order amid the strong natural impulses of a primitive people. The
nobles of the court adopted the morals, manners, and language of the
French aristocracy; their marriages were transactions in realty, and
were alleviated with lovers and mistresses. The women of the court were
better educated than the men, but in moments of passion they could erupt
in hot words and murderous vio- lence. Among the people language was
coarse, violence was frequent, and cruelty corresponded with the
strength of the frame and the thickness of the skin. Everyone gambled
and drank according to his means, and stole accord- ing to his station,
15 but everyone was charitable, and huts exceeded palaces in
hospitality. Brutality and kindness were universal.</p>
<p>Dress varied from the fashions of Paris at the court to the fur caps,
sheep- skins, and thick mittens of the peasantry; from the silk
stockings of the noble to the woolen bands that encased the legs and the
feet of the serf. In sum- mer the common people might bathe nude in the
streams, sex ignored. Rus- sian baths, like the Turkish, were heroic but
popular. Otherwise hygiene was occasional, sanitation primitive. Nobles
shaved; commoners, despite the ukases of Peter the Great, kept their
beards.</p>
<p>Nearly every home had a balalaika, and St. Petersburg, under
Elizabeth and Catherine II, had opera imported from Italy and France.
Here came famous composers and conductors, and the finest singers and
virtuosi of the age. Musical education was well financed, and justified
itself in the outburst of musical genius in the second half of the
nineteenth century. From all Russia promising male voices were sent to
the leading churches to be trained. As the Greek rite allowed no
instruments in choirs, the voices had free play, and attained such
depths of unison and harmony as were hardly equaled elsewhere in the
world. Boys took the soprano parts, but it was the bassos that
astonished many a foreigner with their nether reach, and their range of
feel- ing from whispers of tenderness to waves of guttural power.</p>
<p>Who composed this moving music for Russia’s choirs? Mostly obscure
monks, unknelled and unknown. Two stand out in the eighteenth century.
Sozonovich Berezovsky was a Ukrainian lad whose voice seemed designed
for the adoration of God. Catherine II sent him to Italy at state
expense to get the best musical education; he lived for years at
Bologna, and under</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Padre Martini he learned the art of composition. Returning to Russia,
he wrote religious music that combined Russian intensity with Italian
elegance. His efforts to reform the singing of the choirs met with
orthodox resistance; he fell into morbid melancholy, and killed himself
at the age of thirty-two (1777). 16 Still more famous was Dmitri
Bortniansky. When only seven years old he was admitted to the Court
Church Choir; the Empress Elizabeth com- missioned Galuppi to tutor him;
when Galuppi returned to Italy Catherine II sent Dmitri with him to
Venice; thence he passed to Padre Martini, and then to Rome and Naples,
where he composed music in the Italian style. In 1779 he returned to
Russia; he was soon appointed director of the Court Church Choir, and he
kept this post till his death (1825). For the choir he composed a Greek
Mass, and settings in four and eight parts for forty-five Psalms. It was
due especially to his training that the choir reached the excellence
which made it one of the wonders of the musical world. In 1901
St. Petersburg cel- ebrated with pomp the 1 50th anniversary of his
birth.</p>
<p>French influence dominated Russian art, but the leading figure was an
Italian, Francesco (or Bartolomeo) Rastrelli. His father, Carlo, had
been called to Russia by Peter the Great (1715), and had cast in bronze
an eques- trian statue of Peter, and a full-length figure of the Empress
Anna Ivanovna. The son inherited the Louis Quinze Style that Carlo had
brought from France; he added to it some inspiration from the baroque
masterpieces of Balthasar Neumann and Fischer von Erlach in Germany and
Austria; and he adapted these influences so harmoniously with Russian
needs and styles that he became the architectural favorite of Czarina
Elizabeth. Almost every Russian building of artistic note from 1741 to
1765 was designed by him or his aides. On the left bank of the Neva he
raised (1732-54) the Winter Palace, which was burned down in 1837 but
was conjecturally restored on the original plan: a monstrous mass of
windows and columns in three layers, topped by statues and battlements.
More to Elizabeth’s taste was the Palace of Tsarskoe Selo (i.e., the
Czar’s village), on a hill fifteen miles south of St. Petersburg. At its
left he built a church; in the interior of the palace a cere- monial
stairway led to a Grande Galerie which was illuminated by immense
windows during the day and by fifty-six chandeliers at night; at the
farther end were the throne room and the apartments of the Empress. A
Chinese Room paid the usual homage of the eighteenth century to Chinese
art; an Amber Room was paneled with plaques of amber, given to Peter the
Great by Frederick William I in exchange for fifty-five tall grenadiers;
and a pic- ture gallery housed some of the imperial collections. The
interior was mostly in rococo decoration, which an English traveler
described as a “mixture of barbarism and magnificence.” 17 Catherine II,
who was chaste if only in her taste, had the golden ornaments of the
fa§ade removed.</p>
<p>Literature developed more slowly than art. The paucity of readers
gave it little encouragement, censorship by Church and state cramped
expression, and the Russian language had not yet refined itself, in
grammar or vocabu- lary, into a literary vehicle. And yet, even before
the accession of Elizabeth (1742), three writers left their names on the
face of history. Vasili Tatish- chev was a man of action and thought, a
traveler and historian, a diplomat</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) RUSSIAN INTERLUDE 427</p>
<p>and philosopher, loving Russia but opening his mind eagerly to
economic and intellectual developments in the West. He was one of
several promising youths whom Peter sent abroad for intellectual
insemination. He came back with dangerous ideas: he had read, directly
or in summaries, Bacon, Des- cartes, Locke, Grotius, and Bayle; his
Orthodox faith had withered, and he supported religion only as an aide
to government. 18 He served Peter in dangerous campaigns, became
governor of Astrakhan, and was accused of peculation. 19 In his
wanderings he gathered a store of geographical, ethno- logical, and
historical data, which he used in a History of Russia. The book offended
the clergy; no one dared print it till the early and liberal years of
Catherine II’s reign ( 1 768-74).</p>
<p>Prince Antioch Cantemir continued the revolt against theology. Son of
a Moldavian hospodar (governor) , he was brought to Russia in his third
year, learned to speak six languages, served in embassies to London and
Paris, met Montesquieu and Maupertuis, and, returning, wrote satires of
those “Pan - Slavic” patriots who opposed the contamination of Russian
life with Western ideas. Here is a bit of his poem “To My Mind”:</p>
<p>Immature mind, fruit of recent studies, be quiet, urge not the pen
into my hands…. Many easy paths lead in our days to honors; the least
acceptable is the one the nine barefoot sisters [the Muses] have laid
out…. You have to toil and moil there, and while you labor people avoid
you as a pestilence, rail at y ou, loathe you…. “Who pores over books
becomes an atheist”; thus Crito grumbles, his rosary in his hands,… and
bids me see how dangerous is the seed of learning that is cast among us:
our children,… to the horror of the Church, have begun to read the
Bible; they discuss all, want to know the cause of all, and put little
faith in the clergy;… they place no candles before the images, they
observe no feasts….</p>
<p>O Mind, I advise you to be dumber than a dumpling…. Complain not of
your obscurity…. If gracious Wisdom has taught you anything,… explain it
not to others. 20</p>
<p>Kantemir offended further by translating Fontenelle’s Entretiens sur
la pluralite des mondes. The book was denounced as Copernican,
heretical, blasphemous, but Kantemir foiled his persecutors by dying at
thirty-six (1744). Not till 1762 did his satires find a publisher.</p>
<p>Under Czarina Elizabeth Russian literature began to assert itself as
some- thing more than an echo of the French. Mikhail Lomonosov felt
rather the German influence; having studied at Marburg and Freiburg, he
married a Frdulein, and brought with her to St. Petersburg a heavy load
of science. He became the lion of the Academy, adept in everything, even
in drinking. 21 He refused to specialize; he became a metallurgist,
geologist, chemist, electrician, astronomer, economist, geographer,
historian, philologist, orator; Pushkin called him “the first Russian
university.” 22 Amid all this he was a poet.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>hat his salary of five thousand rubles per year did not suffice to
keep both his theater and himself alive. “What was once seen at Athens,
what is now to be seen in Paris, is also seen in Russia, by my care…. In
Germany a crowd of poets has not produced what I have succeeded in doing
by my own efforts.” 23 In 1760 he tired of his labors and moved to
Moscow, but there his flair for quarreling soon left him moneyless. He
appealed to Catherine II to send him abroad at state expense, and
assured her: “If Europe were described by such a pen as mine, an outlay
of 300,000 rubles would seem small.” 24 Catherine bore with him till he
died of drink (1777).</p>
<p>Let us enliven our pages with the romance of a princess. Natalia
Borisovna Dolgorukaya was the daughter of Count and Field Marshal Boris
Chere- metyev, comrade in arms of Peter the Great. At the age of fifteen
(1729), “radiantly beautiful,” and “one of the greatest heiresses in
Russia,” 25 she was betrothed to Vasili Lukich Dolgoruki, the prime
favorite of Czar</p>
<p>Peter II. Before they could be married Peter died, and his successor
banished Vasili to Siberia. Natalia insisted on marrying him and
following him into exile. She lived with him for eight years in Tobolsk,
and bore him two chil- dren. In 1739 he was put to death. After three
more years of exile she was allowed to return to European Russia. Having
completed the education of her children, she entered a convent at Kiev.
There, at the request of her son Mikhail, she composed her Memoirs
(1768), which her poet grandson, Prince Ivan Mikhailovich Dolgoruki,
published in 1810. Three Russian poets have celebrated her memory, and
Russia, honors her as the type of the many Russian women who ennobled
revolution with their heroism and constancy.</p>
<p>All in all, Russian civilization was a mixture of unavoidable
discipline and callous exploitation, of piety and violence, of prayer
and profanity, of music and vulgarity, of fidelity and cruelty, of
servile obsequiousness and indomi- table bravery. These people could not
develop the virtues of peace because they had to fight, through long
winters and long winter nights, a bitter war against the arctic winds
that crossed unhindered over their frozen plains. They had never known
the Renaissance or the Reformation, and so — except in their artificial
capital — they were still imprisoned in medieval swaddling clothes. They
comforted themselves with pride of race and surety of faith: not yet a
territorial nationalism, but a fierce conviction that while the West was
damning itself with science, wealth, paganism, and unbelief, “Holy
Russia” remained loyal to the Christianity of the patriarchs, was more
en - deared to Christ, and would someday rule and redeem the world.</p>

<li>RUSSIAN POLITICS: 1725-41</li>
</ol>
<p>Between Peter the Great and Elizaveta Petrovna Russian history is a
dreary and confusing record of intrigue and palace revolutions; here, if
anywhere, we may with a good conscience save space and time.
Nevertheless, some ele- ments of the melange must be noted if we are to
understand the position, character, and conduct of Catherine the
Great.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) RUSSIAN INTERLUDE 429</p>
<p>The natural heir to the throne in 1725 was Piotr Alexeevich, the
ten-year- old boy of Peter’s slain son Alexis. But Peter’s widow, who
could neither read nor write, persuaded the palace guard (by paying
their long-overdue wages) that he had designated her as his successor;
and with their support she pro- claimed herself (February 27, 1725)
Catherine I, Empress of All the</p>
<p>Russias. This lesser Catherine then took to drink and adultery,
achieved stupor every evening, retired regularly by 5 a.m., and left the
government to her former lover Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov and
a Supreme Council. Count Andrei Ostermann, of German birth, took charge
of foreign affairs and directed Russia into friendship with Germany and
Austria and hostility to France. Following the plans of Peter I,
Catherine married her daughter Anna Petrovna to Karl Friedrich, duke of
Holstein-Gottorp; the couple went to live in Kiel, where Anna bore the
future Peter III. Catherine herself, exhausted with pleasure, died May
6, 1727, having nominated as her heir that same Piotr Alexeevich whose
throne she had usurped.</p>
<p>Peter II was still only twelve; Menshikov continued to govern, and
used his power to feather his nest. A group of nobles, led by the
brothers Ivan and Vasili Lukich Dolgoruki, overthrew Menshikov and
banished him to Siberia, where he died in 1729. A year later Peter II
was carried off by small- pox, and the male branch of the Romanov
dynasty ended. It was this contre- temps that allowed Russia to be ruled
for sixty-six years by three women who rivaled or exceeded, in executive
capacity and political results, most contemporary kings, and outpaced
all of them but Louis XV in sexual prom- iscuity.</p>
<p>The first of these czarinas was Anna Ivanovna, the
thirty-five-year-old daughter of Ivan Alexeevich, the feeble-minded
brother of Peter the Great. The Council chose her because she had
acquired a protective reputation for humility and obedience. Dominated
by the Dolgorukis and the Golitsyns, the Council drew up “Conditions”
which they sent to Anna, then in Kurland, as prerequisite to her
confirmation as empress. She signed (January 28, 1730). But neither the
army nor the clergy wished to replace autocracy with oligarchy. A
delegation of the palace guard went out to meet Anna, and petitioned her
to take absolute power. Emboldened by their arms, she tore up the
“Conditions” in the presence of the court.</p>
<p>Distrusting the Russian nobles, Anna brought in from Kurland the Ger-
mans who had pleased her there. Ernst von Biihren, or Biron, who had
been her lover, became the head of her government; Ostermann was
restored to for- eign affairs; Count Christoff von Miinnich reorganized
the army; Lowen- wolde, Korff, and Keyserling helped to give the new
regime some German efficiency. Taxes were collected with careful rigor;
education was extended and improved; an instructed civil service was
prepared. With similar effec- tiveness the new administration
imprisoned, banished, or executed the Dol- gorukis and the
Golitsyns.</p>
<p>Satisfied with two lovers (Biron and Lowenwolde), Anna lived a
relatively regular life, rose at eight, gave three hours to government,
and smiled ap- proval as her Germans expanded Russian power. An army

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>invaded Poland, deposed the French-oriented Stanislas Leszczynski,
en- throned the Saxon Augustus III, and took the first step toward
binding Po- land to Russia. France countered by urging Turkey to attack
Russia; the Sultan demurred, being busy on his Persian front; Russia
thought it a good time to declare war against Turkey; so began (1735)
sixty years of conflict for control of the Black Sea. Anna’s diplomats
explained that the Turks, or their dependents in South Russia, held the
outlets of the five great rivers — Dniester, Bug, Dnieper, Don, Kuban —
which were the main channels of south-bound Russian commerce; that the
semibarbarous Moslem tribes in- habiting the lower basins of these
streams were a standing threat to the Chris- tians of Russia; that the
northern shores of the Black Sea were a natural and necessary part of
Russia; and that a great and growing nation like Russia should no longer
be blocked from free access to the Black Sea and the Med- iterranean.
This remained the theme song of Russia through the remainder of the
century, and beyond.</p>
<p>The first objective was the Crimea, the almost-island that stood as a
Turk- ish stronghold on the northern front of the Black Sea. To take
that peninsula was the goal of Miinnich ’s campaign in 1736. His chief
foes were space and disease. He had to cross 330 miles of wilderness in
which not one town could provide food or medicine for his 57,000 troops;
eighty thousand wagons had to accompany them in a long line subject at
any point and moment to attack by Tatar tribes. With brilliant
generalship Miinnich in twenty-nine days took Perekop, Koslov, and
Bakhchisarai (the Crimean capital) ; but in that month dysentery and
other ailments spread such misery and mutiny among his men that he had
to abandon his conquests and retreat into the Ukraine. Meanwhile another
of Anna’s generals took Azov, which controlled the mouth of the Don.</p>
<p>Miinnich marched south again in April, 1737, with seventy thousand
men, and captured Ochakov, near the mouth of the Bug. In June Austria
joined in attacking the Turks, but its campaign so miscarried that it
signed a separate peace; and Russia, suddenly left to face the full
Turkish army, and expecting war with Sweden, signed (September 18, 1739)
a peace that restored to the Turks almost all that had been won in three
campaigns. This treaty was celebrated in St. Petersburg as a splendid
triumph, which had cost only a hundred thousand lives.</p>
<p>Anna survived the war by a year. Shortly before her death (October
17,</p>
<ol start="1740" type="1">
<li>she named as heir to the throne the eight-week-old Ivan VI, son of
her German-born niece Anna Leopoldovna and Prince Anton Ulrich of
Brunswick, Biron to be regent till Ivan reached seventeen. But Miinnich
and Ostermann had now had enough of Biron; they joined with Ulrich and
Leopoldovna to send him to Siberia (November 9, 1 740). Anna Leopoldovna
became regent, with Miinnich as “first minister.” Fearing the total
domina - tion of Russia by Teutons, the French and Swedish ambassadors
aroused and financed a revolt of the Russian nobles. They chose as their
secret candi- date for the throne Elizaveta Petrovna, daughter of Peter
the Great and Catherine I.</li>

<p>RUSSIAN INTERLUDE</p>
<p>43 1</p>
<p>Elizabeth, as we shall call her, was thirty-two years old, but was at
the height of her beauty, courage, and vivacity. She loved athletics and
violent exercise, but also she was fond of amorous delight, and
entertained a succes- sion of gallants. She had little education, wrote
Russian with difficulty, spoke French well. She seems to have had no
thought of gracing the throne until Anna Leopoldovna and Ostermann set
her aside in favor of foreigners. When the Regent ordered the
St. Petersburg regiments to Finland, and the soldiers grumbled at facing
a winter war, Elizabeth seized the opportunity; she put on military
garb, went to the barracks at 2 a.m. December 6, 1741, and ap- pealed to
the soldiers to support her. At the head of a regiment she sledged over
the snow to the Winter Palace, awakened the Regent, and sent both her
and the baby Czar to prison. When the city awoke it found that it had a
new ruler, a thoroughly Russian Empress, a daughter of the great Peter.
Russia and France rejoiced.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ELIZABETH PETROVNA: 1741-62</li>
</ol>
<p>It is difficult to make her out through the mists of time and
prejudice. Catherine II, meeting her in 1744, was “struck by her beauty
and the majesty of her bearing…. In spite of being very stout, she was
not in the least dis- figured by her size, nor embarrassed in her
movements,… though she wore an immense hoop when she dressed up.” 26 She
was privately skeptical to the verge of atheism; 27 publicly she was
zealously orthodox. A French observer noted her “pronounced taste for
liquor,” 28 but we must remember that Russia is cold and vodka warms.
She refused marriage, fearing that it would divide her power and
multiply disputes; some say that she secretly married Alexis Razumovsky;
if so, he was merely primus inter pares. She was vain, loved finery, had
fifteen thousand dresses, heaps of stockings, 2,500 pairs of shoes; 29
some of these she used as missiles in argument. She could up- braid her
servants and courtiers in the language of a sergeant. She sanctioned
some cruel punishments, but she was basically kind. 30 She abolished the
death penalty except for treason ( 1 744) ; torture was allowed only in
the gravest trials; flogging remained, but Elizabeth felt that some way
had to be found to discourage the criminals who made the highways and
city streets unsafe at night. She was both restless and indolent. She
had a keen natural intelli- gence, and gave her country as good a
government as the condition of Rus- sian education, morals, manners, and
economy allowed.</p>
<p>Having banished Ostermann and Miinnich to Siberia, she restored the
Senate to administrative leadership, and entrusted foreign affairs to
Alexei Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ry umin. Catherine II described him as “a
great in - triguer, suspicious, firm and intrepid in his principles, an
implacable enemy, but the true friend of her friends.” 31 He was fond of
money, as those usually are who know that their high state invites a
fall. When England sought to bribe him it estimated his integrity as
costing 100,000 crowns. 32 We do not know if the purchase went through,
but Bestuzhev generally took an Eng-</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>43 2</p>
<p>lish line; this, however, was a natural retort to French support of
Sweden and Turkey against Russia. Frederick the Great in his turn
offered Bestuzhev 100,000 crowns if he would ally Russia with Prussia;
the offer was refused; 33 instead, Bestuzhev allied Russia with Austria
(1745) and England (1755). When England followed this by an alliance
with Prussia (January 16, 1756), Bestuzhev’s house of chancelleries fell
apart, and Elizabeth henceforth ig - nored his advice. A new ministry
bound Russia to the Franco- Austrian “re - versal of alliances,” and the
Seven Years’ War was on.</p>
<p>We have seen — far back! — how the Russian general Apraksin defeated
the Prussians at Gross- Jagersdorf (1757), and then withdrew his army
into Poland. The French and Austrian ambassadors convinced Elizabeth
that Bestuzhev had ordered Apraksin’s retreat and was conspiring to
depose her. She ordered the arrest of both the Chancellor and the
general (1758). Apraksin died in jail. Bestuzhev denied both charges,
and later knowledge has cleared him. His foes wished to torture him into
confession; Elizabeth forbade this. Mikhail Vorontsov replaced Bestuzhev
as chancellor.</p>
<p>Amid the balls, gambling, intrigues, jealousies, and hatreds of the
court, Elizabeth encouraged her aides to advance Russian civilization.
Her young favorite Ivan Shuvalov opened a university at Moscow,
established primary and secondary schools, sent students abroad for
graduate study in medicine, and imported French architects, sculptors,
and painters for the Academy of Arts (Akademia Iskustv) which he set up
in the capital (1758). He cor- responded with Voltaire, and induced him
to write a History of the Russian Empire under Peter the Great (1757).
His brother Piotr Shuvalov helped the economy by removing tolls on
internal trade. Meanwhile, however, to con- sole the Pan-Slavists,
Elizabeth allowed religious intolerance to grow; she closed some mosques
in the Tatar regions, and banished 35,000 Jews.</p>
<p>Her proudest achievement was that her armies and generals repeatedly
de- feated Frederick II, stopped the Prussian advance, and were on the
point of crushing him when her physical decline weakened her power to
hold the Franco- Austro-Russian alliance together. As early as 1755 the
British am- bassador reported: “The health of the Empress is bad; she is
affected with spitting of blood, shortness of breath, constant coughing,
swollen legs, and water on the chest; yet she danced a minu et with me.”
34 Now she paid heavily for having preferred promiscuity to marriage.
Childless, she had long sought someone of royal blood who could face the
external and internal problems of Russia, and, inexplicably, her choice
had fallen upon Karl Friedrich Ulrich, son of her sister Anna Petrovna
and of Karl Friedrich, duke of Holstein-Gottorp. It was the greatest
error of her reign, but she re- deemed it by her choice for his
mate.</p>
<p>V. PETER AND CATHERINE: 1 743-6 1</p>
<p>Piotr Feodorovich, as Elizabeth renamed her heir, was born at Kiel in
1728. As grandson of both Peter I and Charles XII, he was eligible to
both the</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>RUSSIAN INTERLUDE</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>Russian and the Swedish thrones. Of feeble health, he was kept at
home till he was seven; then, by a sudden change, he was assigned to the
Holstein Guards, and was raised to be a soldier. He became a sergeant at
nine, marched proudly in field parades, and learned the language and
morals of army offi- cers. At eleven he was given a German tutor who
brought him up unforget- tably in the Lutheran faith, and disciplined
him into neurosis. Browbeaten by this pedagogue, he shrank into timidity
and secrecy, took to cunning and deceit, 35 became “permanently
irritable, stubborn, quarrelsome.” 38 Rousseau might have cited him as
illustrating the notion that man is good by nature but is deformed by a
bad environment; Peter had a kind heart, and a longing to do the right,
as we shall see by his royal decrees; but he was ruined by being cast
for parts he was not fitted to play. Catherine II, meeting him when he
was eleven, described him as “good -looking, well-mannered, cour-
teous,” and she “felt no repugnance at the idea” of becoming his wife.
37</p>
<p>In 1743 Elizabeth had him brought to Russia, made him grand duke,
con- verted him, apparently, to the Orthodox faith, and tried to train
him for rule. But she “stood aghast” at the inadequacy of his education
and the in- stability of his character. At St. Petersburg he added
drunkenness to his other faults. Elizabeth hoped that before she herself
died this strange youth, if mated to a healthy and intelligent woman,
might beget a competent future czar. With that lack of ethnic prejudice
which marked the European aris- tocracies even during the rise of
nationalistic states, Elizabeth looked out- side Russia and chose an
undistinguished princess from one of the smallest German principalities.
The wily Frederick II had recommended this choice, hoping to have a
friendly German czarina in a Russia already fearsome to Germany.</p>
<p>At this point we are confronted by the memoirs of Catherine the
Great. There is no doubt of their authenticity; they were not printed
till 1859, but the French manuscript, in Catherine’s own hand, is
preserved in the national archives in Moscow. Are they trustworthy? By
and large the story they tell is confirmed by other sources. 38 Their
fault is not mendacity but partiality; they are a tale told well with
wit and verve, but they are in part an apologia for having dethroned her
husband, and for bearing with such equanimity the news that he had been
killed.</p>
<p>She was born in Stettin, Pomerania, April 21, 1729, and was
christened Sophia Augusta Frederika after three of her aunts. Her mother
was Princess Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp; through her
Catherine was a cousin to Peter. Her father was Christian August, prince
of Anhalt-Zerbst in central Germany, a major general i n Frederick’s
army. Both parents were disap - pointed by the birth of a girl; the
mother mourned as if it had been a mis- carriage. Catherine atoned for
her sex by developing the virility of a general and the statesmanship of
an emperor, all the while remaining the most sought and found mistress
in Europe.</p>
<p>She had a variety of childhood sicknesses, one so severe that it left
her apparently deformed for life, “the backbone running zigzag,” the
“right shoulder much higher than the left”; she now “assum ed the shape
of the letter</p>
<p>434</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Z.” The local hangman, who had become a specialist in dislocations,
encased her in a corset “which I never removed day or night except when
changing my underclothes”; and “after eighteen months I began to show
signs of straightening out.” 39 She was so often told that she was ugly
that she de - termined to develop intelligence as a substitute for
beauty; she was another case of a felt defect stimulating compensatory
powers. Her ugliness disap- peared as puberty rounded out her angles
into curves. Despite her tribula- tions she was of “a happy
disposition,” and of such natural vivacity “as needed to be restrained.”
40</p>
<p>She was educated by tutors, especially by a Lutheran clergyman who
suf- fered from her questions. Was it not unfair, she asked, “that
Titus, Marcus Aurelius, and all the great men of antiquity, virtuous
though they might be, should have been damned because they did not know
about R evelation?” She argued so well that her teacher proposed to flog
her, but a governess inter- vened. She especially wanted to know what
that chaos had been like which, according to Genesis, had preceded the
Creation. “His replies never seemed to satisfy me,” and “we both lost
our tempers.” He was still further harassed by her insistence on his
explaining “just what was circumcision?” 41 Her other teachers and the
governess were French, so that she learned that lan- guage well; she
read Corneille, Racine, and Moliere, and was clearly ready for Voltaire.
She became one of the best-educated women of her time.</p>
<p>News of this bright princess reached the Empress Elizabeth, eager for
a girl who might give Peter intelligence by osmosis. On January i, 1744,
an invitation came to Sophia’s mother to come with her for a visit to
the Russian court. The parents hesitated; Russia seemed dangerously
unstable and primi- tive; but Sophia, surmising that she was being
considered as a wife for the Grand Duke, pleaded for an affirmative
reply. On January 12 they began the long and difficult journey through
Berlin, Stettin, EastTrussia, Riga, and St. Petersburg to Moscow. At
Berlin Frederick entertained them, and took a fancy to Sophia, “asking
me a thousand questions, and talking about opera, comedy, poetry,
dancing, everything, in short, that one could possibly imag- ine in
conversing with a girl of fourteen.” 42 At Stettin “my father tenderly
took leave of me, and t his was the last time I saw him; I cried
bitterly.” Mother and daughter, with a lavish entourage, reached Moscow
on February 9, after a sleigh ride of fifty-two hours from
St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>That evening she met Peter for the second time, and again was
favorably impressed, until he confided to her that he was a convinced
Lutheran, and was in love with one of the ladies in waiting at the
court. 43 She noticed that his German accent and manners were
distasteful to the Russians; for her part she resolved to learn Russian
thoroughly, and to accept the Orthodox faith in toto. She felt “little
more than indifference” toward Peter, but “I was not indifferent to the
Russian crown.” She was given three teachers— for the lan- guage, for
the religion, and for Russian dances. She studied so earnestly — once
getting out of bed in the middle of the night to study her lessons —
that on February 22 she was bedded with pleurisy. “I remained between
life and death for twenty-seven days, during which I was bled sixteen
times, some-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>RUSSIAN INTERLUDE</p>
<p>imes four times a day.” 44 Her mother lost favor at court by asking
that a Lutheran clergyman be summoned; Sophia won many hearts by asking
for a Greek priest. At last, on April 21, she was able to appear in
public. “I had become as thin as a skeleton;… my face and features were
drawn, my hair was falling out, and I was totally pale.” 45 The Empress
sent her a pot of rouge.</p>
<p>On June 28 Sophia underwent, with impressive piety, the ceremony of
conversion to the Orthodox faith. Now to her existing names were added
Ekaterina Alexeevna; henceforth she was Catherine. The next morning, in
the great cathedral, Ouspenski Sobor, she was formally betrothed to
Grand Duke Peter. All who saw her were pleased with her tactful modesty;
even Peter began to love her. After fourteen months of apprenticeship
they were married, August 21, 1745, at St. Petersburg. On October 10
Catherine’s mother left for home.</p>
<p>Peter was now seventeen, his wife sixteen. She was beautiful and he
was plain, having suffered from smallpox in their betrothal year. She
was intel- lectually avid and alert; he “displayed,” said Soloviev,
“every symptom of mental backwardness, and resembled a grown- up child.”
46 He played with dolls and marionettes and toy soldiers; he was so fond
of dogs that he kept several of them in his apartment; Catherine was not
clear which was worse, their barking or their stench. 47 He did not
improve the situation by playing his violin. His taste for liquor
increased; “from 1753 he got drunk almost daily.” 48 The Empress
Elizabeth often reproved him for his faults, but she did not add example
to precept. She was more disturbed by his unconcealed dislike of Russia,
which he called “an accursed land”; 49 by his scorn of the Orthodox
Church and clergy; above all, by his idolatry of Frederick the Great,
even when Russia and Prussia were in deadly war. He surrounded himself
with a “Holsteiner Guard” of soldiers nearly all German; in his pleas -
ure house at Oranienbaum he dressed his attendants in German uniforms,
and put them through Prussian drills. When the Russian generals Fermor
and Saltykov defeated the Prussians in 1759 they refrained from pursuing
their victories for fear of offending Peter, 50 who might at any moment
become czar.</p>
<p>The marriage became almost a conflict of cultures, for Catherine was
fur- thering her education by studying the literature of France. It
seems incredible that this young woman, in her unhappy years as grand
duchess, read Plato, Plutarch, Tacitus, Bayle, Voltaire, Diderot, and
Montesquieu, whose Spirit of Laws, she said, should be “the breviary of
every sovereign of common sense.” 51 Such books must have finished
Catherine’s religious beliefs— though she continued assiduously her
observation of the Orthodox ritual; and they gave her that conception of
“enlightened despotism” which Frederick had imbibed from Voltaire a
generation before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (if we may believe her firsthand report) “the marriage
between</p>
<p>436 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>cruel; the violence of his love, his reiterated efforts, could not
accomplish the consummation of his marriage” 53 — a remarkable parallel
with Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Perhaps the distaste that
Catherine, during their long be- trothal, had come to feel for Peter had
become evident to him, and made him psychologically impotent. He soon
turned to other women, and took a suc- cession of mistresses, who hoped
to replace Catherine as grand duchess. In her account these first years
of marriage were years of misery for her. One day (according to Horace
Walpole), when the Empress asked her why no issue had come of her union,
she replied that none should be expected — which in effect announced her
husband’s impotence. “Elizabeth replied that the state demanded
successors, and left the Grand Duchess to procure them by whose
assistance she pleased. A son and a daughter were the fruits of her obe-
dience.” 5 4 Mme. Maria Choglokova, appointed by Elizabeth to be lady in
waiting to Catherine, explained to the Grand Duchess (according to the
Grand Duchess) that there were important exceptions to the rule of
marital fidelity; she promised to keep the secret if Catherine took a
lover; 55 and “there can be little doubt that this shameful suggestion
came not from the</p>
<p>Did Catherine follow these exemplars to excess? After her accession,
yes. Before her accession she seems to have limited herself stoically to
three lov- ers. First — some six years after marriage — came Sergei
Saltykov, a lusty young officer. Catherine explains her response:</p>
<p>If I may venture to be frank,… I combined, with the mind and tempera-
ment of a man, the attractions of a lovable woman. I pray to be forgiven
for this description, which is justified by its truthfulness…. I was
attractive; consequently one half of the road to temptation was already
covered, and it is only human in such situations that one should not
stop halfway…. One can- not hold one’s heart in one’s hand, forcing it
or releasing it, tightening or re - laxing one’s grasp at will. 57</p>
<p>In 1751 she became pregnant, but had a miscarriage; and this painful
ex- perience was repeated in 1753. In 1754 she gave birth to the future
Emperor Paul I. Elizabeth rejoiced, gave Catherine a present of 100,000
rubles, and sent Saltykov to safe obscurity in Stockholm and Dresden,
where, Catherine tells us, he was “frivolous with all the women he met.”
58 Peter drank more, and took fresh mistresses, finally settling down
with Elizaveta Vorontsova, niece of the new Chancellor. Catherine
quarreled with him, and made public fun of him and his friends. 59 In
1756 she accepted the attentions of a hand- some Pole, twenty-four years
old, Count Stanislas Poniatowski, who had come to St. Petersburg as
attache to Sir Charles Hanbury-Williams, the Brit- ish ambassador.
Stanislas’ autobiography describes her in 1755:</p>
<p>She was five-and-twenty years old;… she was at that perfect moment
which is generally, for women who have beauty, the most beautiful. She
had black hair, a dazzlingly white skin, long black eyelashes, a Grecian
nose, a</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>RUSSIAN INTERLUDE</p>
<p>mouth that seemed made for kisses, perfect hands and arms, a slim
figure rather tall than short, an extremely active bearing, yet full of
nobility. The sound of her voice was pleasant, and her laugh was as
merry as her disposition. 60</p>
<p>Gazing at her, he “forgot that there was a Siberia.” This was the
most deeply felt of her many loves, and his; long after she had taken
other suitors her heart remained with Poniatowski, and he never quite
recovered from his in- fatuation, however sorely tried by her policies.
When she went to stay with Peter at Oranienbaum, Stanislas risked his
life by secretly visiting her there. He was detected, and Peter gave
orders that he be hanged. Catherine inter- ceded with Peter’s mistress,
who, softened by a gift, a ppeased the Grand Duke. Finally, in a burst
of good nature, Peter not only forgave Poniatowski but called Catherine
to join her lover, and entered with them and Elizaveta Vorontsova into
an amiable menage a quatre, with many gay suppers to- gether. 61</p>
<p>On December 9, 1758, Catherine gave birth to a daughter. The court
gen- erally believed that Poniatowski was the father, 62 but Peter took
the credit, accepted congratulations, and organized festivities to
celebrate his achieve- ment; 63 however, the child died four months
later. The Empress had Ponia- towski recalled to Poland, and Catherine
was briefly loveless. But she was charmed by the adventures, in love and
war, of Grigori Grigorievich Orlov, aide-de-camp to Piotr Shuvalov.
Orlov had made a reputation by keeping to his post in the battle of
Zorndorf despite three wounds. He had the build of an athlete and “the
face of an angel”; 64 but his only morality was to win power and women
by any available means. Shuvalov had a mistress, Princess Elena Kurakin,
one of the fairest and loosest beauties of the court; Orlov won her away
from his superior; Shuvalov vowed to kill him, but died before attending
to the matter. Catherine admired Orlov’s cour age, and noted that in the
guards he had four brothers all tall and strong; these five warriors
would be useful in an emergency. She arranged a meeting with Grigori,
then another, and another; soon she displaced Kurakin. By July, 1761,
she was pregnant ; in April, 1762, she gave birth, as secretly as
possible, to Orlov’s son, who was brought up as Alexis Bobrinsky.</p>
<p>In December, 1761, it became apparent that the Empress was entering
upon her final illness. Attempts were made to bring Catherine into a
plot to prevent the accession of Peter; she was warned that Peter, as
czar, would cast her aside and make Elizaveta Vorontsova his wife and
queen; but Catherine refused to join in the plot. On January 5, 1762
(N.S.), the Empress Elizabeth died, and Peter, without open opposition,

<p>He astonished everyone by the generosity of his measures. The good
na- ture that had been blurred by coarse and thoughtless manners came to
the fore in a burst of gratitude for his peaceful accession to power. He
pardoned enemies, he retained most of Elizabeth’s ministers, and he
tried to be kind to</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Catherine. In the royal palace he allowed her comfortable quarters at
one end, housed himself at the other, and assigned to his mistress the
intermediate rooms; it was a mortal affront, of course, but Catherine
was secretly pleased to be at a distance from him. He provided her with
an ample allowance, and paid her extensive debts without inquiring into
their origin. 65 In official cere- monies he gave her equal standing
with himself, sometimes yielded her prece- dence. 66</p>
<p>He recalled from exile the men and women whom previous rulers had
sent to Siberia; now Munnich returned, aged eighty-two, to be welcomed
by thirty-two grandsons; Peter restored him to his rank as field
marshal; Miin- nich vowed to serve him to the end, and did. The happy
Emperor freed the nobles from the obligation that Peter the Great had
laid upon them to give many years of their lives to the state; they
proposed to build a statue of him in gold; he bade them use the metal
more sensibly. 67 A decree of February 2 1 abolished the universally
hated secret police, and forbade arrest on political charges until these
had been reviewed and sanctioned by the Senate. On June 25 Peter issued
a ukase that adultery should henceforth be exempt from official censure,
“since in that matter even Christ had not condemned”; 68 the court was
delighted. Merchants were pleased by a lowering of export dues; the
price of salt was reduced; the buying of serfs for factory labor was
stopped. Old Believers, who had fled from Russia to avoid persecution
under Elizabeth, were invited to return and enjoy religious freedom. The
clergy, however, was incensed by decrees of February 1 6 and March 2 1
nationalizing all the lands of the Church, and making all Orthodox
clergymen salaried em- ployees of the government. The serfs on these
secularized domains were freed, and serfs on the estates of the nobility
expected that they too would soon be freed. Amid all these reforms —
suggested to him by various ministers — Peter continued to drink
heavily.</p>
<p>The most startling of his measures, and the one that gave him the
greatest happiness, was his termination of the war with Prussia. Even
before his acces- sion he had done much to help Frederick, secretly
transmitting to him the military plans of Elizabeth’s Council; now he
boasted of having done this. 69 On May 5 he bound Russia with Prussia in
defensive and offensive alliance. He instructed the commander of the
Russian forces then with the Austrian army to put them at the service of
“the King my master.” 70 He donned a Prussian uniform, and ordered the
local soldiery to do the same; he estab- lished Prussian discipline in
the army; he organized military exercises every day for his court, and
compelled every male courtier to participate regardless of age and gout.
71 He gave his own “Holsteiner Guard” precedence over th e proud
regiments of the capital.</p>
<p>The Russian army was not averse to peace, but it was shocked by
Russia’s precipitate desertion of her French and Austrian allies, and
her surrender of all terrain won from Prussia during the war. It was
alarmed when Peter an- nounced that he proposed to send a Russian host
against Denmark to recover that duchy of Schleswig which Denmark had
taken from the dukes of Hol- stein, who included Peter’s fath er. The
troops made it clear that they would</p>

<p>RUSSIAN INTERLUDE</p>
<p>439</p>
<p>refuse to fight such a war; when Peter asked Kirill Razumovsky to
lead an army to Denmark, the general answered, “Your Majesty must first
give me another army to force mine to advance.” 72</p>
<p>Suddenly, despite his brave and remarkable reforms, Peter found
himself unpopular. The army hated him as a traitor, the clergy hated him
as a Lu- theran or worse, the unfreed serfs clamored for emancipation,
and the court ridiculed him as a fool. Upon all this came the general
suspicion that he in- tended to divorce Catherine and marry his
mistress. 73 “That young woman” (according to Castera), “destitute of
everything like address, but stupidly proud,… had the art of obtaining
from the Czar — sometimes by flattery, sometimes by chiding, and
sometimes even by beating him — a renewal of the promise he had made
her,… to marry her and place her, instead of Cather- ine, upon the
throne of Rus sia.” 74 As power and liquor went more and more to his
head, he treated Catherine harshly, even to publicly calling her a fool.
75 The Baron de Breteuil wrote to Choiseul: “The Empress [Catherine] is
in the crudest state, and is treated with the utmost contempt…. I should
not be surprised, knowing her courage and violence, if this were to
drive her to some extremity… Some of her friends are doing their best to
pacify her, but they would risk everything for her if she required it.”
76</p>
<p>St. Pet ersburg and its environs were full of Catherine’s partisans.
She was popular with the army, the court, and the populace. Next to her
ladies in waiting and Grigori Orlov, her closest intimate in these
critical days was Eka- terina Romanovna, Princess Dashkova. This bold
and enterprising lady was only nineteen years old, but, as niece to
Chancellor Vorontsov and sister to Peter’s mistress, she was already
prominent in the affairs of the court. Peter,</p>
<p>On June 14 Peter ordered Catherine’s arrest; he canceled the order,
but bade her retire to Peterhof, twelve miles west of the capital. Peter
himself withdrew to Oranienbaum with his mistress. He left instructions
that the army should prepare to sail for Denmark, and promised to join
it in July. On June 27 Lieutenant Passek was arrested for making
derogatory speeches against the Emperor. Fearing that he would be
tortured into confessing the plot, Grigori and Alexei Orlov decided that
they must act at once. Early on the twenty-eighth Alexei rode in haste
to Peterhof, roused Catherine from her sleep, and persuaded her to ride
back with him to St. Petersburg. On the way they stopped at the barracks
of the Ismailovsky Regiment; the soldiers were summoned by a drum roll;
Catherine appealed to them to save her from the threats of the Emperor;
they swore to protect her; “they rushed to kiss my hands and feet, the
hem of my dress, calling me their savior” (so Cather - ine wrote to
Poniatowski 78 ) — for they knew that she would not send them to</p>

<p>Denmark. Escorted by two regiments and the Orlovs, she proceeded to
the Kazan Cathedral, where she was proclaimed autocrat of Russia. The
Preo- brazhensky Regiment joined her there, and begged her to “forgive
us for being the last to come.” 79 The Horse Guards fell in, and
fourteen thousand troops accompanied her to the Winter Palace; there the
Church Synod and the Senate officially announced the dethronement of
Peter and the accession of Catherine. Some high dignitaries protested,
but the army frightened them into swearing allegiance to the
Empress.</p>
<p>She donned the uniform of a captain of the Horse Guards, and rode at
the head of her troops to Peterhof. Peter had come there that morning to
see her; informed of the revolt, he fled to Kronstadt; Miinnich offered
to go with him to Pomerania and organize an army to restore him; Peter,
unable to de- cide, returned to Oranienbaum. When Catherine’s forces
approached he spent a day in pleas for a compromise; then, on June 29
(O. S.), he signed his abdication; “he allowed himself to be
overthrown,” said Frederick, “as a child lets himself be sent to bed.”
80 He was imprisoned at Ropsha, fifteen</p>
