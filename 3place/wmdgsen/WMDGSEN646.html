<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>Tragedy in the Netherlands</p>
<p>1649-1715*</p>
<p>T HE century from 1555 to 1648 had seen the heroic defense of the</p>
<p>Netherlands against the world-embracing empire of Spain; the period
from 1648 to 1715 saw the magnificent defense of the Dutch Republic
against the swelling navy of England and the unprecedented armies of
France. In each case the tiny state maintained itself with a courage and
success that claim a high place in history. And amid these burdens and
assaults it continued its development of commerce, science, and art; its
cities offered havens of refuge to harassed thought; and its republican
in- stitutions flung an inspiring challenge to encompassing and powerful
mon- archies.</p>
<p>I. THE SPANISH NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>The southern or Spanish Netherlands continued till 1713 under Spanish
rule. Their ethnically diverse peoples were overwhelmingly Catholic, and
they preferred to be subject to a distant and weakened Spain rather than
to the Protestants north of them, or to a neighboring France that
threatened at any moment to engulf them. The Peace of the Pyrenees
(1659) gave most of Artois to France; the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
(1668) gave her Douai and Tournai; the Peace of Nijmegen (1678) gave her
Valenciennes, Maubeuge, Cambrai, St.-Omer, and Ypres. And the Dutch
Republic was as merciless as the French monarchy. By the Treaty of
Westphalia (1648) Spain, eager to free its armies for continued war with
France, not only ceded to the United Provinces the districts that they
had captured in Flanders, Limburg, and Brabant, but agreed that the
River Scheldt should be closed to foreign trade. This stifling
humiliation crippled Antwerp and the whole economy of the Spanish
Netherlands. La politique ria pas d’en - trailles.</p>
<p>Within such hostile walls what we now call Belgium cherished its tra-
ditional culture, welcomed the Jesuits, and followed the intellectual
lead of Louvain. When the French bombarded Brussels (1695) a large
section of</p>
<p>• The political and military history of the Netherlands after 1688 i
s deferred to Chapter XXIV below.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS 165</p>
<p>the city was turned into debris; all the lovely architecture of the
Grand’ Place was destroyed except a guild hall and the noble Hotel de
Ville. The Maison du Roi (in which the royal address was read to the
States-General) was rebuilt in ornate Gothic (1696); this and the Hotel
de Ville are among the most beautiful structures in Europe today.
Sculptors lavished their art in adorning the facades of churches and
civic buildings, and the pulpits, confessionals, and tombs in church
interiors. Brussels continued to make fine tapestries. 1</p>
<p>Flemish painting declined sharply after Rubens and Vandyck, as if
those two lives had exhausted the pictorial genius of a century. The
rise of France in art and wealth drew many Flemish painters, like
Philippe de Champaigne. A greater man, David Teniers the Younger,
stayed. Taught by his father, he became a “master” in the Guild of
St. Luke by the age of twenty-three; and four years later (1637) he
sealed his success by marrying Anne, daugh- ter of Jan “Velvet” Brueghel
and ward of Rubens himself. In 1651 the Archduke Leopold William
summoned him from Antwerp to Brussels to be court painter and curator of
the royal museum; one of Teniers’ can - vases shows the Archduke and
himself among the pictures of this gallery. 2 He painted with reluctant
skill old themes like The Prodigal Son 3 and The Temptation of
St. Anthony , 4 but like his Dutch contemporaries he pre- ferred to
catch within small frames the life of the peasantry, not reducing the
peasantry to brutes as in Pieter Brueghel, but joining with them in
their recreations and festivals. He showed himself acquainted in detail
with the Interior of a Cabaret , 5 but he could also paint rural
landscapes transfigured by an ever-changing sky. He loved light as
Rembrandt loved shade, and he caught it on his brush with a sensitive
delicacy that has not been surpassed.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE DUTCH REPUBLIC</li>
</ol>
<p>The seven Dutch provinces were now united in a proud and victorious
republic whose wealth and expansion stirred the wonder and jealousy of
its neighbors. Here was a nation anomalously without a king; each town
was almost independently governed by a council of rich burghers; each
town council sent delegates to a provincial assembly; each such assembly
sent representatives to a States-General that ruled the interrelations
of the provinces, and their foreign affairs. So far it was an ideal
government for the merchant princes whose fortunes were swelling with
the growth of Dutch trade. Against this oligarchy of businessmen stood
one aristocratic force: the descendants of that William I and Silent of
Orange and Nassau who had led the country through the darkest days of
its struggle with Spain. The States-General had rewarded him with the
title of stadholder</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>1 66</p>
<p>and command of its armies; he had been able to transmit that title
and command to his descendants; and the control of the military was now
a power ever threatening to transform the oligarchic republic into an
aristo- cratic monarchy. In July, 1650, William II of Orange, as
stadholder and captain general, tri ed by a coup d’etat to establish his
supreme authority over all the United Provinces; several provincial
leaders resisted; William and his soldiers imprisoned six of them,
including Jacob de Witt, burgo- master of Dordrecht. But smallpox
defeated William in victory; he died on November 6, 1650, aged
twenty-four. A week later his widow, Mary Stuart (great-granddaughter of
the last Queen of Scots), gave birth to William III of Orange, destined
to surpass his father’s dreams by becoming King of England.</p>
<p>Beneath these rival ruling classes the farmers and fishermen who fed
the nation shared only such remnant of its prosperity as the merchants,
manu- facturers, and landowners neglected to absorb. If we may believe
the Dutch painters, the peasants had been depressed by war and
exploitation to an almost bestial poverty, redeemed by festivals and
dulled by drink. The craftsmen in their shops, and the workers in the
factories of Amsterdam, Haarlem, and Leiden were better paid than their
like in England, 8 but they staged a bitter strike in 1672. Huguenot
immigrants from France enriched Dutch industry with their savings and
their skills. By 1700 the United Prov- inces had replaced France as the
leading industrial nation in the world.</p>
<p>The greatest fortunes were derived from overseas commerce and devel-
opment. In 1652 the Dutch made their first settlement at the Cape of
Good Hope, and founded Capetown. The Dutch East India Company paid divi-
dends averaging eighteen per cent over a period of 198 years. 7 The
natives in the Dutch colonies were sold or worked as slaves; the
investors at home heard little about this, and took their dividends with
Dutch placidity. Dutch foreign trade continued till 1740 to exceed that
of any other nation; 8 of twenty thousands vessels carrying the maritime
commerce of Europe in 1665, fifteen thousand were Dutch. 9 The merchants
and financiers of Hol- land were by general agreement the ablest of the
time. The Bank of Am- sterdam had evolved practically all the techniques
of modern finance; its deposits were estimated at what would now be
,ooo,ooo; 10 accounts running into millions could be settled there in an
hour; and confidence in Dutch solvency and reliability was so high that
the Dutch Republic could borrow money at a lower rate of interest —
sometimes as low as four per cent — than any other government. 11
Amsterdam was probably the most beautiful and civilized city in Europe
in this age. We have seen Descartes’ eulogy of it; Spinoza spoke
likewise. 12 Pepys was equally enthusiastic about The Hague — “a most
neat place in all respects, the houses so neat in all places and things
as possible.” 18</p>
<p>N^hese thriving provinces would have been a paradise but for the
nature</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>of man. Their prosperity invited attacks by England and France;
the</p>
<p>struggle for internal control led to the tragedy of Jan de Witt; and
the rivalry of religious creeds divided an otherwise amiable people into
devout hostilities. The predominant Calvinists, wherever they could,
prevented the public exercise of Catholic worship. In 1682 the Synod of
Dort (Dord- recht), probably retaliating the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes, drew up a confession of orthodox Calvinism, required every
pastor to sign it or be dismissed, appointed Pierre Jurieu, an ex-French
Huguenot, to conduct a Calvinist Inquisition, subpoenaed, tried, and
excommunicated heretics, and invoked the “secular arm” to imprison them.
14 Nevertheless the Ar - minian heresy grew; bold men dared to think
that God had not predestined the majority of mankind to everlasting
hell. Dissenting sects — Mennonites, Collegiants (who sheltered
Spinoza), Lucianites, Pietists, even Unitarians — found it possible to
live in Holland in the interstices and slumbers of the law. Socinians
had sought refuge in the United Provinces from persecution in Poland,
but their Unitarian worship was forbidden by a Dutch statute of 1653.
Daniel Zwicker published at Amsterdam in 1658 a treatise ques- tioning
the divinity of Christ, and subordinating the Bible to “the universal
reason of mankind”; yet he managed to die as pe aceably as a general. In
1 668, however, one Kerbagh, for expressing similar ideas, was sentenced
to ten years in prison, where he died. Hadrian Beverland was jailed for
sug- gesting that the original sin of Adam and Eve was sexual
intercourse and had little to do with apples.</p>
<p>Toward the close of the seventeenth century religious toleration in-
creased. Dealing with many countries of diverse cultures, opening their
ports and bourse to merchants of many faiths or none, the Dutch found it
profitable to practice a degree of toleration imperfect indeed, but
consid- erably broader than elsewhere in Christendom. Though the
Calvinists were politically supreme, the Catholics were so numerous that
their suppression was impracticable. Moreover, as Sir William Temple
noted, the social and political dominance of the business classes left
the clergy with far less influence than in other states. Refugees from
other lands, contributing to the economy or the culture, demanded and
received a limited religious freedom. When Cromwell seized power in
England, its Royalists sought safety in Holland; when Charles II was
restored, English republicans took refuge in the Dutqh Republic; when
Louis XIV oppressed the Huguenots, they escaped in part to the United
Provinces; when Locke, Collins, and Bayle feared persecution in England
or France, they found a haven in Holland; when the Portuguese synagogue
of Amsterdam excommunicated Spinoza he was received and aided by Dutch
scholars, and pensioned by Jan de Witt. Li ttle Holland became “the
school of Europe” 15 in business and finance, in science and
philosophy.</p>
<p>This civilization would have been depressingly materialistic had it
not</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>1 68</p>
<p>been for its religious liberty, its science, its literature, and its
art. Huygens and other Dutch scientists will meet us later. There were
Dutch poets, dramatists, and historians, but their language confined
their fame. The Dutch cities were alive with books and publishers.
England had only two publishing centers, London and Oxford, France had
Paris and Lyons; the United Provinces had Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leiden,
Utrecht, and The Hague, printing books in Latin, Greek, German, English,
French, and Hebrew as well as in Dutch; Amsterdam alone had four hundred
shops printing, publishing, and selling books. 16</p>
<p>The taste for art competed with the lust for money and the bargaining
for eternal salvation. The Dutch burghers, who had denuded their Prot-
estant churches of ornament, gave to their women and their homes the
decoration they had taken from the Lord. They quieted their wives with
velvet, silk, and gems; they spread their tables with gold and silver
plate; they brightened their walls with tapestries, and their shelves or
cupboards with pottery or engraved glass. At Delft, after 1650, Dutch
potters, in- spired by imported Chinese and Japanese wares, produced
glazed earthen- ware, chiefly blue on white, that gave a bright
loveliness to homes that had once been puritanically bare. And there was
hardly a Dutch family but had at least one of those little paintings
that brought the ideal of the clean and peaceful dwelling, and the
refreshment of trees, flowers, and streams, within arm’s reach on
domestic walls.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE FLOWERING OF GENRE</li>
</ol>
<p>The heroic age of Dutch painting had passed. The new clients were</p>
<p>more numerous but less wealthy; they asked for small pictures that
would let them see their own daily life in a distilled and refined
extract, reproduced with a realism that aroused the pleasure of
recognition, or touched with some delicate but homely sentiment, or
inviting the soul into a landscape’s liberating view. The Dutch painters
met this demand with a refinement of line and light and color that
crowded meticulous artistry into a little space. These artists are known
throughout Europe and America, for their desperate competition with one
another led them to pour forth a quick profusion of small pictures at
low prices, and now there is hardly a museum that does not hang them.

<p>TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>we must look more leisurely at the unfortunate but joyful Jan Steen,
and the greatest of the genre painters, Jan Vermeer, and the greatest of
Dutch landscape painters, Jacob van Ruisdael.</p>
<p>Steen was a brewer’s son in Leiden, worked in The Hague, Delft, and
Haarlem, and ended as a tavernkeeper in Leiden; in between he made
himself the best figure painter, barring Rembrandt, in Dutch art. At
twenty- three (1649) he married Margarete, daughter of the painter Jan
van Goyen; her face and figure were her only dowry, but they served him
as inspiring models for a time. He was so poorly paid for his pictures
that in 1670 an apothecary attached all the paintings he could find in
Steen’s house, and auctioned them off to cover a debt of ten gulden. His
early pictures record the pleasures or penalties of intoxication. An
excellent example, Dissolute Life , 17 shows one woman drowsy, another
asleep, with liquor; seizing the moment, a child steals from a cupboard;
a dog eats from the table; a nun, entering, launches into a homily on
the sinfulness of rum; everything here, though picturing chaos, is
composed and drawn with the order and</p>
<p>harmony of art. A lovelier theme animates the misnamed Menagerie : 18
a little girl feeds milk to a lamb, garden fowl prance about, a peacock
dangles his tail from a blasted tree; pigeons perch aloft, a dove soars
in from the street: this is an idyl that makes all the problems of
philosophy seem meaningless; it is life, each part with its own
sufficient reason, ignoring ultimates. When Steen bypassed the tavern he
gave bright views of Dutch civilization: pleasant interiors, music
lessons, concerts, festivals, happy families, and the artist himself,
smoking in The Merry Company 19 or playing the lute. 20 Then,
discouraged by the unappreciative prices paid for his work, he returned
to selling beer, drank forgetfully, and died at the age of fifty-three,
leaving four hundred paintings unsold.</p>
<p>One glance at a single picture by Jan Vermeer, The Head of a Girl ,
21 reveals a world and an art almost antipodal to Steen’s. This pearl
beyond price was auctioned away in 1882 for two and a half gulden; a
good critic now ranks it as “one of the dozen finest pictures in the
world.” 22 The young lady obviously comes of a good home and family; her
eyes are clear of fear, unclouded with even the normal wonderment of
youth; she is quietly happy, and alert to the music of life; and she is
given to us with a careful craftsmanship of color, line, and light that
make the brush an astonishing vehicle of understanding and sympathy.</p>
<p>Vermeer was born at Delft in 1632, lived there, so far as we know,

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>exact contemporary of Spinoza (1632-77). He married at twenty, and
had eight children; he received good prices for his paintings, but he
toiled at them with such time-consuming care, and spent so much money in
buying pictures, that he died in debt; his widow had to apply for aid to
the court of bankruptcy. Yet his thirty-four surviving works suggest a
background of middle-class comfort. One of them 23 shows him in his
studio, with fluffy cap and particolored jerkin, stockings, rumpled but
of silk, his</p>
<p>buttocks bulging with prosperity. Doubtless he lived in one of the
better quarters of Delft, perhaps in the outskirts from which he could
have a View of Delft– 24 we feel, in that famous picture, his fondness
for his native town. He seems to have been more contentedly domesticated
than the artists of our time. Love of the home shines out in most Dutch
painting, but in Vermeer the home becomes a little temple, and the
housewife is proud of her ministrations; in his Christ with Mary and
Martha 25 the latter shares the pedestal with Mary. His women are no
longer the heavy bundles of flesh sometimes seen in Dutch art; they are
of some refinement and sensitivity; they may even, like the seated lady
in Mistress and Maid , 29 be expensively robed, delicately featured,
carefully coiffured, or be rich in silk and musical instruments, like
the Lady Seated at the Virginals 27 Vermeer makes an epic of family
life, or a lyric of simple and normal domestic moments; not group scenes
of confused and multiple activity, but at his best one woman alone,
quietly reading a letter, 28 or intent on her sewing, 29 or adorning
herself with a necklace, or asleep at her sewing, 30 or just a girl and
her smile. 31 Vermeer recorded with perfect art his gratitude for a good
woman and a happy home. In the eighteenth century he was almost for-
gotten; his little masterpieces were ascribed to de Hooch, Terborch, or
Rembrandt; only in 1858 was he disinterred. Now his name stands only
after those of Rembrandt and Hals in Dutch painting.</p>
<p>One thing is missing in these genre painters — the life of nature
that surrounded the interloping towns. Italy, and Poussin in Italy, had
caught some of the fresh air and open fields; England would discover
them in the next century; now Dutch painters, leaving for a while their
chaste or hilarious interiors, placed their easels to capture the lure
of rippling streams, silent and leisurely windmills, burgeoning farms,
trees shaming our hectic transiency, exotic vessels swaying in crowded
ports, clouds kaleidoscoping the sky. All the world knows the
Middelharnis Road of Meindert Hobbema — perspective vanishing into
endless space; but far more beautiful is his Water Mill with the Great
Red Roof . 32 Aelbert Cuyp found his inspiration in plump kine wading in
lush marshes, 33 horses halting thirsty at an inn, sails disappearing on
the sea. 84 Salomon van Ruisdael marveled at the tremor of waters
reflecting and inverting boats and trees ( Canal and Ferry 33 ), and
taught his nephew to surpass him.</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS 171</p>
<p>Jacob van Ruisdael grew in Haarlem, and left us a View of Haarlem</p>
<p>quite as impressive as Vermeer’s Delft, and better conveying the vast
yet huddled complexity of a great city. Moving to Amsterdam, he became a
member of the Mennonite Brethren, and perhaps their mysticism helped his
poverty to make him feel the tragic side of the nature in which he loved
to lose himself. He knew that those fields, woods, and skies that
promised peace could also destroy, that nature had moods of wrath in
which even the proudest, sturdiest trees could be shorn by mad winds and
tom from their roots, that deadly clefts could form in the good earth,
that lightning could wreak its lethal fire upon every form of life with
playful indifference. No idyl is The Waterfall on the Cliff , 37 but the
furious surge of the sea upon rocks that it has vowed to shatter and
submerge or wear away; The Storm ? 3 is the sea beating in rage against
its enemy the land; The Beach 39 is no pleasure strand but a shore
disordered by a mounting surf under a lowering sky; Winter * 0 is no
skating frolic, but a poor cottage shivering under threatening clouds;
and the masterly etching of Oak T rees despoils them of their dignity to
show their branches disheveled or bare, their trunks wounded and
distorted by inclement time. The Jewish Cemetery 41 is itself an image
of death — ruined walls, a dying tree, flood waters running over tombs.
Not that Ruisdael was always gloomy; in The Wheat Field 42 he rendered
with deep feeling the quiet of a country road, the blessing of rich
crops, the exhilaration of expanding space. The Dutch seem to have felt
their land and clime maligned in Ruisdael’s pictures; they paid for

<p>Their independence won, the United Provinces, after the Treaty of</p>
<p>Westphalia, gave themselves to the pursuit of money, pleasure, and
war. They were the least self-contained nation in history; the products
of their soil could support only an eighth of their population; the life
of the country depended upon foreign trade and colonial exploitation;
and these depended upon a navy capable of protecting Dutch vessels and
settlements. The Spanish mastery of the seas had ended with the defeat
of the Spanish Armada. The English navy, bouncy with victory, spread its
sails out over</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>the ocean. Soon English mercantile expansion encountered. Dutch ships
and Dutch settlements in India, the East Indies, Africa, even in the
“New Amsterdam” that was to become New York. Some Englishmen, still warm
with the fire of Hawkins and Drake, felt that these ubiquitous Dutch
should be replaced by ubiquitous Britons, and that this could be done
with a naval victory or two. “The merchants,” reported the Earl of
Clarendon, “took to discourse of ‘the infinite benefit that would
accrue’ from a barefaced war against the Dutch, how easily they might be
subdued, and the trade carried on by the English.” 44 Cromwell thought
it a good idea.</p>
<p>In 1651 the English Parliament passed a Navigation Act forbidding</p>
<p>foreign vessels to bring into England any merchandise except that
produced in their own country. The Dutch had been shipping to England
the</p>
<p>products of their colonies; now this lucrative trade was stopped.
They sent an embassy to London to secure some modification of the act;
the English not only refused, but demanded that Dutch vessels meeting
English ships in “English waters” ( i.e., all the waters between
England, France, and the Netherlands) should lower their flags in
recognition of English dominance of those seas. The Dutch emissaries
returned empty- handed to The Hague. In February, 1652, the English
seized seventy Dutch merchantmen found in “English waters.” On May 19 an
English fleet under Robert Blake met a Dutch squadron under Maarten
Tromp; Tromp refused to lower his flag; Blake attacked; Tromp withdrew.
So began the “First Dutch War.”</p>
<p>The separatism of the supposedly United Provinces now brought them
close to disaster. The unified military leadership formerly provided by
the princes of Orange had lapsed; the States-General became a debating
society instead of a state. The English had a strong and centralized
government under the resolute Cromwell; they had a better navy; they had
all the ad- vantages of geography and prevailing westerly winds. They
destroyed Dutch fishing fleets, captured Dutch merchantmen, and defeated
the Dutch Admiral de Ruyter off the coast of Kent. Tromp won over Blake
off</p>
<p>Dungeness (November 30, 1652), but died in battle in the following
July. The result of a year’s war was the overwhelming demonstration of
English naval power. English blockade of the Dutch coast brought
economic life almost to a standstill in the Provinces. Thousands of
their population approached starvation, and threatened revolt.</p>
<p>It was at this unhappy juncture that Jan de Witt undertook the
leadership of the country. He came of a family long prominent in Dutch
commerce and politics. His father, Jacob de Witt, was six times elected
burgomaster of Dordrecht. Jan himself received all available education,
traveled in France with his older brother, Cornelis, met Cromwell in
England, and then settled down as a lawyer in The Hague (1647). Three
years later his</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>father was among the six republican leaders imprisoned by William II
of Orange, the Stadholder, who wished to establish his political, as
well as his military, authority over all the seven provinces. When
William II died (1650) the States-General, perhaps influenced by the
apparently successful creation (1649) of a republic in England, refused
to accept his posthumous son as his successor, and discontinued the
stadholdership. The internal drama of the United Provinces became a
struggle between the mercantile republican and pacific spirit
represented by de Witt, and the martial aristocratic spirit soon to be
revived in the young and ardent William III.</p>
<p>On December 21, 1650, Jan de Witt, still a youth of twenty-five, was
elected pensionary (chief magistrate) of Dordrecht, and its
representative in the States-General of the United Provinces. In
February, 1653, that body named him grand pensionary of the republic,
and gave him the bitter task of negotiating peace with victorious
England. Cromwell was merciless. He demanded that the Dutch acknowledge
English dominance, and salute the English flag, in the Channel; that
they admit the right of English captains to search Dutch vessels at sea;
that they pay for the privilege of fishing in English waters, and give
compensation for the murder of Englishmen by the Dutch in Amboyna in
1623; and that they perpetually exclude from office or power all members
of the house of Orange — which, being allied by marriage to the Stuarts,
had vowed to restore that dynasty in England. De Witt removed this last
clause from the treaty as presented to the States- General and ratified
by it (April 22, 1654); then he induced the Estates of the one province
of Holland to accept the treaty with this clause included. William III
never forgave him.</p>
<p>De Witt consolidated his position by marrying the wealthy Wendela
Bicker; through her he became related to the mercantile princes of
Amster- dam; with their support he filled the most important posts in
Holland with his father, his brother, his cousins, and his friends; soon
he had in his hands all the reins of government in the province. Other
provinces reluctantly accepted his lead, for Holland, enriched by its
ports, paid fifty-seven per cent of the Union’s expenses, and provided
most of the Dutch fleet. He was unpopular with the masses, but his
administration was enlightened and competent. He checked extravagant
outlays, reduced the interest on the federal debt, overhauled the fleet,
built better ships, trained new naval personnel. Reflecting the
sentiments of the merchants, he strove for peace but prepared for war.
In 1658, and again in 1663, he was re-elected as grand pensionary of the
United Provinces. He impressed observers with his devotion to the tasks
of government, the simplicity and modesty of his bearing, and the
integrity of his family life. The wealth of his wife enabled him to live
in a sumptuous home, where he could receive foreign emissaries in
imposing surroundings; but that home was a center of Dutch culture</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>rather than of luxurious display; poetry mingled there with politics;
science and philosophy were discussed perhaps too freely for de Witt’s
Calvinistic constituents; and even the dreaded heretic Spinoza found a
loyal friend and protector in the Grand Pensionary.</p>
<p>It was always his tragedy that he loved peace more than war, while
the neighbors of the rich republic gathered their forces to destroy it.
In 1660 Charles II was restored to the throne of England. He pointedly
recom- mended his nephew, William III of Orange, to the good will of Jan
de Witt; soon he demanded the annulment of that “Act of Seclusion” by
which William was barred from office; de Witt consented; and so the
Stuart King unwittingly prepared the fall of the Stuart dynasty. In
October, 1664, an English expedition seized the Dutch colony of New
Amsterdam, and re- named it New York in honor of the Duke of York (the
future James II), then head of the English navy. The States-General of
the United Provinces protested; the protest was ignored; in March, 1
665, the Second Dutch War began.</p>
<p>The preparations that de Witt had made were now vindicated. Weakness
of leadership had passed from the States-General to the careless and in-
competent government of Charles II; and while the Merrie Monarch danced
with his mistress, de Witt won the applause even of his enemies by the
energy and devotion with which he attended to all the aspects and
details of military organization. Repeatedly he sailed with the fleet,
exposed himself to all the perils of battle, and inspired the crews with
his courage and zeal. The Dutch navy was not yet equal to the English in
vessels, men, or</p>
<p>discipline; and in the first major encounter of the war the English
navy under the Duke of York decisively defeated the Dutch (Lowestoft,
June 13, 1665). The patient burghers reconstituted the fleet, and put it
under the command of one of history’s ablest and most daring admirals.
In June, 1667, Michel Adriaanszoon de Ruyter led sixty-six ships into
the Thames, captured the fort of Sheerness (some forty miles east of
London), broke the barriers that had blocked entry into the Medway
(which flows into the Thames at Sheemess), and captured, burned, or sank
sixteen English men-of-war that lay there unprepared for so unmannerly a
visitor (June 12, 1667). Charles II, having no taste for war, bade his
diplomats offer the Dutch an acceptable peace. On July 21, 1667, the two
powers signed the Treaty of Breda. The Dutch surrendered the apparently
unimportant New York to England, and agreed to salute the English flag
in English waters; England surrendered the colony of Surinam (Dutch
Guiana, in South America) to the Dutch, and modified the Navigation Act
in favor of Dutch trade. The treaty was a moderate victory for de Witt,
and</p>
<p>brought him to the height of his career.</p>
<p>But he made now a succession of fatal blunders. He further
alienated</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>the supporters of William III by putting through the provincial
assembly of Holland (August 5, 1667) a “Perpetual Edict” excluding any
stadholder of any province from supreme military or naval command of the
Union. Thereupon the adherents of the young Prince resigned from the
army, leaving it without experienced leadership. Unfortunately, this act
of family rivalry occurred while France was invading the Spanish
Netherlands, thereby threatening the vital interests of the United
Provinces. A France controlling the southern provinces would soon reopen
the Scheldt to foreign trade; Antwerp, revived, would challenge the
commercial</p>
<p>ascendancy of Amsterdam; the whole economy of the northern provinces
would be imperiled. And how long would Louis XIV stop at the Dutch
frontier? If he should decide to absorb the United Provinces, and take
control of the mouths of the Rhine, the country would in effect cease to
exist, and Dutch Protestantism would be doomed.</p>
<p>De Witt offered the aggressive King a series of compromises; they
were refused. He arranged with England (January 23, 1668), and shortly
there- after with Sweden, a Triple Alliance for common defense against
expand- ing France. Louis tactfully agreed to end his “War of
Devolution” on</p>
<p>condition of retaining a cordon of cities and fortresses that he had
captured in Flanders and Hainaut. These terms were accepted by England
and Swe- den, and therefore by the United Provinces, in the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle (May 2, 1668). Apparently the danger h ad been averted
by de Witt’s diplomacy. In July he was elected to a fourth term of five
years as grand pensionary of the republic.</p>
<p>But he had misread the policies of the French and English kings.
Louis never forgave the Dutch for interfering with his conquest of the
Spanish Netherlands. He vowed that “if Holland should trouble him as it
had done the Spanish, he would send his men with shovels and pickaxes to
throw it into the sea,” 45 presumably by opening the dykes. He resented
the republic and coveted the Rhine; he was resolved to destroy the one
and control the other. A war of tariffs heated the conflict: Colbert had
laid prohibitive duties upon Dutch goods entering France, and the Dutch
had retaliated in kind. A clever exception was made for munitions;
Louvois, French minister of war, persuaded the Dutch manufacturers to
sell him great quantities of war material; 46 meanwhile the Dutch
businessmen withheld their consent to the taxes that de Witt proposed
for replenishing the army and its supplies. The French diplomatic corps
proved its skill, or affluence, by detaching England and Sweden from
alliance with the United</p>
<p>Provinces. By the secret Treaty of Dover (June 1, 1670) Charles
II</p>
<p>agreed to abandon the Triple Alliance and join Louis in war against
the Dutch. In 1672 Sweden, needing French help against Denmark and Ger-
many, withdrew from the same alliance. Spain, the Empire, and
Branden-</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>burg promised aid to the republic, but their available forces were
too meager or distant to count much in meeting the immense levies that
were now let loose upon the United Provinces by land and sea. Again de
Witt offered concessions and compromises; they were rejected.</p>
<p>On March 23, 1672, England began the attack upon the Dutch Republic;
on April 6 France declared war. Some 130,000 men marched against the
little state, under Turenne, Conde, Luxembourg, Vauban, and Louis
himself; “Never had there been such a magnificent army,” said Voltaire.
47 By clever and unexpected strategy the main French force passed
through German territory — appeasing the villages with “gifts” — to
assault less strongly fortified points. On June 12, under the fire of
the Dutch and the eyes of the King, the French crossed the Rhine,
swimming the sixty feet of its width that were too deep for wading; this
became a favorite episode in the iconography of the King. Moving north
into the heart of the United Provinces, the royal armies easily captured
one city after another. Utrecht surrendered without resistance; the
provinces of Overijssel and Gelderland submitted; soon only Amsterdam
and The Hague remained to be taken. It availed little that on June 6 de
Ruyter had defeated the combined English and French fleets at Southwold
Bay. De Witt asked Louis for</p>
<p>terms; Louis demanded a large indemnity, French control of all Dutch
highways and waterways, and the re-establishment of the Catholic
religion throughout the republic. Rejecting these conditions as
tantamount to slavery, the Dutch resorted to their last defense: they
opened the dykes, letting in their ancient enemy, the sea, as a saving
friend. Soon the waters were pouring over the land, and the French
armies, unprepared for such an inundation, retreated helplessly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the country was devastated; the troops of the bishop of
Munster and the Elector of Cologne, allied with Louis, were marching un-
hindered through the province of Overijssel; French and English vessels,
despite de Ruyter, were raiding Dutch commerce; the economic life of the
beleaguered state neared collapse. De Witt, during these bitter months,
had labored as hardly any man in Dutch history before him — raising
funds, equipping and provisioning the fleet, standing on deck beside de
Ruyter in the battle of Southwold Bay, and striving through embassy
after embassy to negotiate a saving peace. In June, 1672, he sent Louis
an offer to cede to him Maastricht and parts of Dutch Brabant, and to
pay all the costs of the war. But this offer too was scorned; and when
de Witt’s countrymen heard of it they denounced him as planning a
treasonable surrender. 48 The people now cast upon him all the
responsibility for their misfortunes. They charged him with naive and
reckless trust in the words of Charles II and Louis XIV; they accused
him of filling a dozen lucrative offices with his relatives; above all,
they could not forgive him for refusing to the house of</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>Orange the military and political honors that through a century had
kept the Dutch provinces free. They laid at his door the incompetence
and cowardice of his bourgeois generals. The Calvinist clergymen
denounced him as a secret freethinker, as a follower of Descartes and
friend of</p>
<p>Spinoza. 49 Even the commercial classes, which had been his main
support, turned against him now as the organizer of defeat.</p>
<p>His brother Cornelis, who had shared with him the emoluments of</p>
<p>office and the burdens and perils of war, received with him the
hatred and insults of the populace. On June 21, 1672, an unsuccessful
attempt was made to assassinate Jan; two days later a like attempt was
made upon Cornelis. On July 24 the officials of The Hague arrested
Cornelis on a charge of plotting against the Prince of Orange. On August
4 Jan resigned his office as grand pensionary. On August 19 Cornelis was
put to the torture, and was condemned to exile. Though warned that he
was risking his life, Jan made his way through a hostile city to the
Gevangenpoort prison to see his brother. Soon a crowd collected outside,
urged on by a sheriff, a goldsmith, and a barber. A civic guard
commissioned to hold back the mob shared its hatred of the de Witts, and
made no resistance when it battered down the doors of the jail and
rushed in. Jan and Cornelis were seized, dragged into the square, and
beaten to death, and their bodies were hung head downward on a lamppost
(August 20, 1672).</p>
<p>The Dutch Republic died with them, and the house of Orange returned
to power.</p>
<p>V. WILLIAM III OF ORANGE</p>
<p>Mary Stuart, broken in spirit by the execution of her father, Charles
I (1649), the death of her young husband, William II of Orange (1650),
the abolition of the stadholdership, and the exclusion of the house of
Orange from office, brought up her son to a somber self-control that
would silently bide its time till persistence brought victory.
Physically weak, surrounded in his development by enemies set to guard
him, but inheriting from William I of Orange the motto Je maintiendrai —
“I will maintain” — he grew up as a sickly lad hiding behind an immobile
face a fire of resolution and revenge. Austere, decorous, coldly
courteous, he shunned amusements and frivolity, and pursued outdoor
sports to overcome his repeated head- aches and his liability to
fainting spells. This was a frail vessel to house the spirit that would
capture the throne of England and chasten the King of France.</p>
<p>His mother went to England in 1660 to rejoice in her brother’s corona
- tion; she died there of smallpox on Christmas Eve. In 1666 the
government</p>
<p>i?8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>of Holland province declared the sixteen-year-old Prince a ward of
the state; Jan de Witt replaced his beloved guardians and tutors with
persons more responsive to the policy of the provincial Estates. 50
William ’s hatred of de Witt grew with every year. At the height of
Jan’s power the Prince, eluding his new guardians, rode from The Hague
to Bergen-op-Zoom (1668), and took a boat to Zeeland, the province that
had been most loyal to his ancestors. The people of its capital,
Middelburg, greeted him with mass demonstrations of fidelity and
affection. He assumed without hesitation or opposition the presidency of
the Zeeland provincial assembly. Returning to The Hague, he announced
that his minority was now ending on his eighteenth birthday (November 4,
1668), and that he would henceforth dispense with the guardians that the
Estates of Holland had given him. The Estates refused to remove them; he
dismissed them; they remained. He bided his time.</p>
<p>It came when the French and German armies overran the Dutch</p>
<p>provinces, Dutch armies surrendered town after town, and The Hague
itself seemed defenseless. Yielding to the demands of the military, and
hoping that the restoration of the house of Orange to leadership would
restore the unity and morale of the nation, the States-General appointed
William captain general of the Union (February 25, 1672). On July 2 the
Estates of Zeeland, flouting the “Perpetual Edict,” elected William thei
r provincial stadholder; on July 4 the Estates of Holland followed suit;
on July 8 he was made supreme commander of the Union’s armed forces on
land and sea. He showed his spirit when the French King offered peace in
return for an indemnity of sixteen million florins and the cession of
large areas to France, Munster, and Cologne; a secret offer was made to
recognize William as king of the remainder. The Estates of Holland asked
his advice; he replied, “Rather let us be hacked to pieces than accept
such conditions.” 61 When the second Duke of Buckingham, coming from
England to urge William to make peace, said to him, “Do you not see that
your country is lost?” he replied, “My country is in great danger, but
there is a sure way never to see it lost, and that is to die in the last
ditch.” 52 Nevertheless, with wisdom remarkable in a youth of
twenty-two, he counseled patient and courteous negotiations with the
English; already he may have seen in a co-operation of the English and
the Dutch the only hope of checking the aggressions of France. He took
measures to strengthen the ties between the United Provinces, the
Empire, and Brandenburg. The outlines of the Grand Alliance were taking
form in his mind.</p>
<p>He proceeded to the headquarters of the army, and so was absent from
The Hague when the de Witts were murdered. He had apparently no share in
planning that act, which perhaps no one had planned; but when he heard
of it he did not hide his satisfaction; and he protected and pensioned
the</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) TRAGEDY IN THE NETHERLANDS 179</p>
<p>men who had led the mob. 63 He tried now to be a good general; he
never succeeded, but the experienced soldiers who came enthusiastically
to his standard reorganized the army and the navy, and victories began
to out- weigh defeats. De Ruyter and Comelis Tromp (son of Maarten)
out-</p>
<p>fought the English and French fleets at Schooneveldt and Kykduin
(1673); the German invaders were stopped in Groningen; William
captured</p>
<p>Naarden; the provinces of Gelderland, Utrecht, and Overijssel were
cleared of the enemy; nearly everywhere the French were in retreat. For
the time being, at least, the United Provinces were saved, and they
hailed William as their savior.</p>
<p>To these successes he added diplomatic victories. On February 19,
1674, he persuaded England to a separate peace by agreeing to pay a war
indemnity of two million florins; on April 22 and May 1 1 he signed
treaties with Munster and Cologne; he confirmed the alliance of the
United</p>
<p>Provinces, Spain, Brandenburg, Denmark, and the Empire against a now
isolated France. As a final stroke he won the hand of Mary, eldest
daughter of James, Duke of York, brother of the English King. The two
leading Protestant powers were now drawn together; the net was being
closed around France; and it was no minor matter that Mary stood only
after her father in line of succession to the English throne. Seldom in
history has so young a statesman laid such farseeing plans, and with
such success.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, the French renewed their attack, took Ypres and
Ghent, and advanced to the Dutch border. De Ruyter was defeated by a
French fleet off the Sicilian coast (April 22, 1676), and died a week
later of his wounds. Louis offered peace to the States-General on
tempting terms: he would restore all Dutch territory held by the French,
provided the States would agree to his retention of Franche-Comte and
Lorraine. The Emperor, Brandenburg, and Denmark protested against such a
peace; William supported them; the States-General, dominated by
commercial interests, overruled him, deserted its allies, and signed the
separate Peace of Nijmegen with France (August 10, 1678).</p>
<p>William viewed the peace as merely a truce, and strove through the
next ten years to reconstruct the alliance. The Dutch merchants
restrained his martial temper, arguing that the exhausted provinces
needed a rest from turmoil, and that prosperity was returning. Two
events of the year 1685 played int o William’s hands. Louis revoked the
Edict of Nantes; persecuted Huguenots crowded into the Netherlands, and
led an active propaganda for a union of Protestant powers against
France. In England James II, become King, revealed his hope to make that
nation Catholic; English Protestants planned to depose him, leaving
William’s wife, Mary, in line for the throne. William had carried on a
liaison with Mary’s best friend, Elizabeth</p>
<p>Villiers, 54 but Mary forgave him, and agreed that if she became
queen of</p>
<p>180 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>England she would obey her husband as king. In 1 686 William
succeeded in arranging an alliance with the Empire, Brandenburg, Spain,
and Sweden for common defense. On June 30, 1688, the English Protestant
leaders invited William and Mary to enter England with armed forces and
help them dethrone their Catholic King. William hesitated, for Louis XIV
had a vast army awaiting the royal decision to attack either the
Netherlands or the Empire. Louis sent it word to advance into Germany;
William’s hands were free. On November 1, 1688, he sailed with fourteen
thousand men to win the throne of England.</p>
