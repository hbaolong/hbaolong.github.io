<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>France: The Regency</p>
<p>1 7 1 5 — 2 3</p>
<p>I. THE YOUNG VOLTAIRE: 1694-1715</p>
<p>H E was not yet Voltaire; till his release from the Bastille in 1 7 1
8 he was Francis Marie Arouet. He was bom in Paris on November 21,
1694,</p>
<p>and became its distilled essence till 1778. His presumptive father,
Francis Arouet, was an affluent attorney, acquainted with the poet
Boileau and the courtesan Ninon de Lenclos, whose wills he wrote, and
with the dramatist Pierre Corneille, whom he described as “the most
boring mortal” he had ever met. 1 The mother, Marie Marguerite Daumard,
was of slightly noble lineage, daughter of an official of the Parlement,
and sister of the comp- troller general of the royal guard; through them
she had access to the court of Louis XIV. Her vivacity and sprightly wit
made her home a minor salon. Voltaire thought she possessed all the
intellect in his parentage, as his father had all the financial skill;
the son absorbed both of these gifts into his herit- age. She died at
the age of forty, when he was seven. Of her five children the eldest was
Armand, who adhered zealously to the Jansenist theology and the
patrimonial property. Francis Marie, the youngest child, was so sickly
in his first year that no one believed he could survive. He continued
till his eighty-fourth year to expect and announce his early death.</p>
<p>Among the friends of the family were several abbes. This title,
meaning father, was given to any secular ecclesiastic, whether or not he
was an or- dained priest. Many abbes, while continuing to wear
ecclesiastical dress, became men of the world and shone in society;
several were prominently at home in irreverent circles; some lived up to
their title literally but clan- destinely. The Abbe de Chateauneuf was
the last lover of Ninon de Lenclos and the first teacher of Voltaire. He
was a man of wide culture and broad views; he passed on to his pupil the
paganism of Ninon and the skepticism of Montaigne. According to an old
but questioned story, he introduced to the boy a mock epic, La Mo’isade,
which was circulating in secret manu- scripts; its theme was that
religion, aside from belief in a Supreme Being, was a device used by
rulers to keep the ruled in order and awe. 2</p>
<p>Voltaire’s education proceeded when his abbe tutor took him o n a
visit to Ninon. The famous hetaera was then (1704) eighty-four years
old. Frangois found her “dry as a mummy,” but still full of the milk of
woman’s</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>kindness. “It pleased her,” he later recalled, “to put me in her
will; she left me two thousand francs to buy books with .” 3 She died
soon afterward.</p>
<p>To balance this diet he was entered, age ten, as a resident student
at the Jesuit College of Louis-le-Grand on the Left Bank of Paris. It
was reputed the best school in France. Among its two thousand pupils
were such sons of the nobility as could bear an education; in his seven
years there Voltaire made many of the aristocratic friends with whom he
maintained an easy familiarity throughout his life. He received a good
training in the classics, in literature, and especially in drama; he
acted in plays presented there, and, aged twelve, wrote a play himself.
He did well in his studies, won many prizes, and delighted and alarmed
his teachers. He expressed disbe- lief in hell, and called heaven “the
great dormitory of the world .” 4 One of his teachers sadly predicted
that this young wit would become the standard- bearer of French deism —
i.e., a religion that discarded nearly all theology except belief in
God. They endured him with their customary patience, and he reciprocated
by retaining, through all his heresies, a warm respect and gratitude for
the Jesuits who had disciplined his intellect to clarity and order. He
wrote, when he was fifty-two:</p>
<p>I was educated for seven years by men who took unrewarded and</p>
<p>indefatigable pains to form the minds and morals of youth. . . . They
inspired in me a taste for literature, and sentiments which will be
a</p>
<p>consolation to me to the end of my life. Nothing will ever efface
from my heart the memory of Father Poree, who is equally dear to all who
have studied under him. Never did a man make study and virtue so</p>
<p>pleasant. … I had the good fortune to be formed by more than one</p>
<p>Jesuit of the character of Father Poree. What did I see during
the</p>
<p>seven years that I was with the Jesuits? The most industrious,
frugal, regulated life; all their hours divided between the care they
took of us and the exercises of their austere profession. I call to
witness the thou- sands educated by them, as I was; there is not one who
would belie my words . 5</p>
<p>After graduation Fran§ois proposed to make literature his profession,
but his father, warning him that authorship was an open sesame to
destitution, insisted on his studying law. For three years Fran§ois, as
he put it, “studied the laws of Theodosius and Justinian in order to
know the practice of Paris.” He resented “the profusion of useless
things with which they wished to load my brain; my motto is, to the
point .” 6 Instead of absorbing himself in pandects and precedents he
cultivated the society of some skeptical epi- cureans who met in the
Temple — the remains of an old monastery of the Knights Templar in
Paris. Their chief was Philippe de Vendome, grand prior of France, who
had enormous ecclesiastical revenues and little reli-</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>gious belief. With him were the Abbes Servien, de Bussy, and de
Chaulieu, the Marquis de La Fare, the Prince de Conti, and other
notables of easy in- come and gay life. The Abbe de Chaulieu proclaimed
that wine and women were the most delectable boons granted to man by a
wise and beneficent Nature. 7 Voltaire adjusted himself without effort
to this regimen, and shocked his father by staying out with such
revelers till the then ungodly hour of io p.m.</p>
<p>Presumably at the father’s request, Voltaire was appointed page to
the French ambassador at The Hague (1713). All the world knows how the
excitable youth fell in love with Olympe Dunoyer, pursued her with</p>
<p>poetry, and promised her eternal adoration. “Never love equaled
mine,” he wrote to her, “for never was there a person better worthy of
love than you.” 8 The ambassador notified Arouet pere that Francois was
not made for diplomacy. The father summoned his son home, disinherited
him, and threatened to ship him off to the West Indies. Frangois, from
Paris, wrote to “Pimpette” that if she did not come to him he would kill
himself. Being wiser by two years and one sex, she answered that he had
better make his peace with his father and become a good lawyer. He
received paternal pardon on condition that he enter a law office and
reside with the lawyer. He agreed. Pimpette married a count. It was
apparently Voltaire’s last ro - mance of passion. He was as high-strung
as any poet, he was all nerves and sensitivity, but he was not strongly
sexed; he was to have a famous liaison, but it would be far less an
attraction of bodies than a mating of minds. His energy flowed out
through his pen. Already at the age of twenty-five he wrote to the Ma
rquise de Mimeure: “Friendship is a thousand times more precious than
love. It seems to me that I am in no degree made for passion. I find
something a bit ridiculous in love … I have made up my mind to renounce
it forever.” 9</p>
<p>On September 1, 1715, Louis XIV died, to the great relief of
Protestant Europe and Catholic France. It was the end of a reign and an
age: a reign of seventy-two years, an age — le grand siecle — that had
begun in the glory of martial triumphs, the brilliance of literary
masterpieces, the splendor of baroque art, and had ended in the decay of
arts and letters, the exhaustion and impoverishment of the people, the
defeat and humiliation of France. Everyone turned with hope and doubt to
the government that was to suc- ceed the magnificent and unmourned
King.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE REGENCY: 1 7 1 5</li>
</ol>
<p>There was a new king, Louis XV, great-grandson of Louis XIV, but he
was only five years old. He had lost his grandfather, his father, his
mother,</p>
<p>6 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. I</p>
<p>his brothers, his sisters, his great-grandfather last of all. Who
would be re- gent for him?</p>
<p>Two dauphins had preceded Le Roi Soleil to death: his son Louis, who
had died in 17 n, and his grandson, the Duke of Burgundy, who had died
in 1712. Another grandson had been accepted as Philip V of Spain, on
con- dition of renouncing all rights to the throne of France. Two of the
old King’s illegitimate sons survived him; he had legitimized them, and
had decreed that in default of princes of the royal blood, they should
inherit his crown. The elder of them, Louis Auguste, Due du Maine, now
forty-five, was an amiable weakling whose consciousness of his club foot
intensified his shy- ness and timidity; he might well have been content
with the luxury and ease of his 900,000-livre estate at Sceaux (just
outside of Paris), had not his ambitious wife prodded him to compete for
the regency. The Duchesse du Maine never forgot that she was the
granddaughter of the Great Conde; she maintained an almost royal court
at Sceaux, where she patronized art- ists and poets (including
Voltaire), and gathered about her a gay and faith- ful entourage as a
prelude and springboard to sovereignty. She had some charms. She was
immaculate in body and garb, so short and slim that she could have been
taken for a girl; she had wit and cleverness, a good classi- cal
education, a ready tongue, an inexhaustible and exhausting vivacity. She
was sure that under her thumb her husband would make a delightful re-
gent. She had prevailed sufficiently with the forces about the dying
King to have drawn from him (August 12, 1715) a will that left to the
Due du Maine control of the young Louis’ per son, education, and
household troops, and a place on the Council of Regency. However, a
codicil (August 25) to that will named, as president of the Council,
Philippe II, Due</p>
<p>d’Orleans.</p>
<p>Philippe was the son of the old King’s androgynous brother Philipp e
I (“Monsieur”) by a second wife, the robust and realistic Charlotte
Elisabeth, Princess Palatine. The youth’s education had been entrusted
to an abbe whom both Saint- Simon’s Memoirs and Duclos’ Secret Memoirs
of the Re - gency describe as a cloaca maxima of vices. The son of a
provincial apothe- cary, Guillaume Dubois studied hard, earned his
living by tutoring,</p>
<p>married, then left his wife, with her consent, to enter the College
Saint- Michel at Paris, where he paid his tuition by zealously
performing menial tasks. Graduating, he accepted a position as aide to
Saint-Laurent, officer of the household to “Monsieur.” He took the
tonsure and minor orders, apparently forgetting his wife. When
Saint-Laurent died Dubois was made tutor to the future Rege nt.
According to the rarely impartial Duclos, “the Abbe felt that he would
soon be despised by his pupil if he did not corrupt him; he left nothing
undone to accomplish this end, and unfortunately was</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>but too successful .” 10 Saint -Simon, who hated unpedigreed talent,
enjoyed himself describing Dubois:</p>
<p>A little, pitiful, wizened, herring-gutted man in a flaxen wig,
with</p>
<p>a weazel’s face brightened by some intellect. In familiar terms, he
was a regular scamp. All the vices unceasingly fought within him for</p>
<p>supremacy, so that a continual uproar filled his mind. Avarice,
de-</p>
<p>bauchery, ambition were his gods; perfidy, flattery, footlicking
his</p>
<p>means of action; complete impiety was his religion; and he held the
opinion, as a great principle, that probity and honesty are chimeras</p>
<p>with which people deck themselves, but which have no existence. . .
.</p>
<p>He had wit, learning, knowledge of the world, and much desire to</p>
<p>please and insinuate himself, but all was spoiled by an odor of
falsehood which escaped in spite of him through every pore of his body.
. . .</p>
<p>Wicked, . . . treacherous, and ungrateful, expert in the blackest
vil-</p>
<p>lainies, terribly brazen when detected. He desired everything, envied
everything, and wished to seize everything . 11</p>
<p>Saint- Simon was close to Philippe’s family, and must not be rashly
con - tradicted; we must add, however, that this abbe was a good
scholar, an able aide, a wise and successful diplomat, and that
Philippe, knowing the man well, remained faithful to him to the end.</p>
<p>The pupil, perhaps already botched by his paternal ancestry, took
readily to his tutor’s instructions, and bettered them in mind an d
vice. He delighted his teacher by his tenacious memory, his intellectual
acumen, his penetrat- ing wit, his understanding and appreciation of
literature and art. Dubois secured Fontenelle to ground the youth in
science, and Homberg to initiate him into chemistry; later Philippe,
like Charles II of England and Voltaire at Cirey, was to have his own
laboratory, and seek in chemical experi- ments some respite from
adultery. He painted tolerably, played the lyre, engraved illustrations
for books, and collected art with the most discrimina- ting taste. In
none of these fields did he dig deeply; his interests were too varied,
and his amusements had an option on his time. He was quite devoid of
religious belief; even in public he “affected a scandalous impiety .” 12
In this and in his sexual license he gave a symbol and impetus to his
country and century.</p>
<p>Like most of us he was a confusion of characters. He lied with ease
and sly delight at need or whim; he spent millions of francs, drawn from
an impoverished people, on his personal pleasures and pursuits; however,
he was generous and kindly, affable and tolerant, “naturally good,
humane, and compassionate” (said Saint -Simon 13 ), and more faithful to
his friends than to his mistresses. He drank himself drunk as a nightly
ritual before going</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>to bed. 14 When his mother reproved him he answered her, “From six
o’clock in the morning till night I am subjected to prolonged and
fatiguing labor; if I did not amuse myself after that, I could not bear
it; I should die of melancholy.” 15</p>
<p>Perhaps his sexual redundancies had some excuse in the abortion of
his first love. He developed a passionate attachment to Mile, de Sery, a
high- born maid of honor to his mother. He wrote poetry for her, sang to
her, visited her twice a day, and wished to marry her. Louis XIV
frowned, and powerfully recommended his bastard daughter, the Duchesse
de Blois. Philippe obeyed (1692), but continued his attentions to Mile,
de Sery so zealously that she bore him a son. The angry monarch banished
her from Paris. Philippe sent her many livres, but tried, with brief
success, to be faith- ful to his wife. She gave him a daughter, the
future Duchesse de Berry, who became his dearest love and bitterest
tragedy.</p>
<p>The death of his father (1701) gave Philippe the ducal title and
family wealth, with no other obligation but to enjoy his life in peace
and risk it in war. He had already fought bravely against the first
Grand Alliance (1692-97), receiving some major wounds; now he won
further distinction by his reckless gallantry in the War of the Spanish
Succession (1702-13). Surviving, he rewarded himself with a feast of
tarts. Through all his sins, and except in his impieties, he maintained
a charm of manners and a re- finement and courtesy of speech reminiscent
of the Sun King’s idyllic youth.</p>
<p>Only when all direct heirs to the throne had been removed by death or
treaty did it occur to Philippe that he might claim the regency. Gossip
accused him of having poisoned the princes of the blood to clear his way
to sovereignty, but posterity has agreed with Louis XIV in rejecting
this calumny. Several groups began’ to think of him as a lesser evil
than the Due and Duchesse du Maine. French Protestants who had under
duress accepted conversion to Catholicism prayed for his accession to
the regency as a man notably inclined to toleration; so did the
Jansenists, suffering under royal persecution and papal bulls; so did
the esprits forts, or freethinkers, who were delighted with the idea of
a freethinker ruling France; so did the Parisian populace, tired of the
late King’s tardy austerities; so did George I of England, who offered
him financial aid, which Philippe refused. Above all, the “nobility of
the sword”— the titled families that had been reduced from their ancient
power by Richelieu and Louis XIV to become depend- ent parasites of the
court — hoped through Philippe to avenge itself against the royal insult
of subjection to bastards in rule and to tradesmen in admini- stration.
Saint-Simon, himself among the highest-ranking nobles, urged Philippe to
abandon his idleness and debauchery, and fight for his right to the
regency.</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Philippe cared more for pleasure than for power, and might have pre-
ferred to be left alone. But now, prodded by his friends, he spurred
himself to a flurry of action. He or they, under the Due du Maine’s
nose, bought the support of the royal household troops. They won
political and military notables with promises of office, and coddled the
Parlement with hopes of former privileges renewed. On September 2, 1715
— the very day after Louis XIV’s death— Philippe summoned the Paris
Parlement, the leaders of the nobility, and the chief officials of the
state to the Palais de Justice. The Due du Maine came hoping to receive
the regency, but the audacity, mendacity, and eloquence of the Due
d’Orleans outplayed him. “I shall n ever,” Philippe promised, “have any
other purpose but to relieve the - tions he could no longer be
answerable for the boy King’s person, and must ask to be relieved of
that duty. Philippe and the Parlement took him at his word, and Maine,
furious but helpless, retired to Sceaux and the tirades of his wife.
Philippe d’Orlea ns, aged forty-two, became for eight years regent of
France.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>BOOM AND CRASH: 1716-20</li>
</ol>
<p>His first task was to restore financial order and stability to the
state. He inherited a bankrupt government, with a debt of 2,400,000,000
livres; to which was added a floating debt of 590 million livres in the
form of billets d’etat — royal promissory notes circulating in the
nation, and now worth hardly a third of their face value. The net
receipts of the government for 1715 were 69 million livres; its
expenses, 147 million. Most of the revenue expected in 1 7 1 6 had been
spent in advance. 17</p>
<p>Saint-Simon advised a flat declaration of bankruptcy. Due Adrien
Maurice de Noailles protested. The Regent compromised with some
intermediate measures of economy and reform. The army was reduced to 2
5,000 men; dis- charged soldiers were exempted from taxes for six years;
those with eight children were permanently exempt. The taille, the
gabelle, the capitation, and other taxes were reduced; abuses in their
collection were denounced,</p>
<p>IO</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>and some were remedied. Hundreds of dispensable governmental office-
holders were dismissed — 2,400 in Paris alone. A Chambre de Justice was
established (March, 1716) before which all those financiers, merchants,
munitions manufacturers, and others were summoned on suspicion of having
defrauded the government. Here Noailles, accustomed to military
measures, instituted a veritable terror; those who would reveal their
fellow defaulters were promised lenience; informers were promised a
fifth of all funds recovered by their help; the penalty of death was
decreed against interference with informers; confiscation of property
and condemnation to the galleys for life were prescribed for those who
gave false testimony about their finances. Some convicted persons were
hanged; some were put into pillories before a rejoicing populace; a few
financiers, hopeless of clearing themselves, committed suicide. The
results were not commen- surate with the methods. Most of the guilty
bought exemption from ex- amination or conviction by bribing the
officials of the Chamber, or the friends of the Regent, or his
mistresses. Corruption ran to the point where, instead of the guilty
offering bribes, the courtiers solicited them. A finan- cier having been
fined 1,200,000 livres, a courtier promised to have the fine forgiven
for a fee of 300,000 livres. “My dear Count,” said the finan - cier,
“you come too late ; I have just concluded a similar arrangement with
your wife for half that sum.” 18 The edict that dissolved the Chambre de
Justice (March, 1717) declared, with a candor rare in governments, that
“corruption was so widely spread that almost all classes were infected
with it, so that just punishments could not be laid upon so great a
number of guilty persons without dangerously disturbing commerce, public
order, and the state.” The net profit to the government, when the
inquisition was ended, was some seventy million francs. 19</p>
<p>Disappointed with these results, the Regent gave ear to a remarkable
Scot who offered him a new system of finance. John Law, bom to an
Edinburgh banker in 1671, studied banking in London, saw the opening of
the Bank of England in 1694, fought a duel over a love affair, killed
his rival, and fled to the Continent with a death sentence on his head.
He was handsome, affable, mathematical; he speculated successfully in
foreign ex- change, and his capacity for calculating and remembering the
combinations of cards helped him to butter his bread in divers lands. He
watched the working of the banks at Amsterdam, Hamburg, Venice, and
Genoa. In Amsterdam especially he felt the magic of the credit system,
by which a bank issued paper money to many times the gold value of its
reserves, put- ting ten gulden to work on the security of one, and so
stimulating, facilita- ting, and multiplying industrial and commerical
activities; and there he saw how, with a bank that businessmen could
trust, transactions might be effected by a mere shifting of bank
balances, without the nuisance of car-</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>rying or exchanging silver or gold. He wondered why such a national
bank and credit system could not be established in France. He conceived
what was later called his Systeme.</p>
<p>His central conception was to increase the employment of men and
materials by issuing paper money, on the credit of the state, to twice
the value of the national reserves in silver, gold, and land; and by
lowering the rate of interest, so encouraging businessmen to borrow
money for new enterprises and methods in industry and commerce. In this
way money would create business, business would increase employment and
produc- tion, the national revenues and reserves would rise, more money
could be is- sued, and the beneficent spiral would expand. If the
public, instead of hoard- ing the precious metals, could be induced, by
interest payments, to deposit its savings in a national bank, these
savings could be added to the reserves, and additional currency could be
issued; idle money would be put to work, and the prosperity of the
country would be advanced.</p>
<p>In 1708 Law expounded his ideas to the French government; Louis XIV
rejected them. When Philippe d’Orleans became regent, Law proposed to
redeem with his System the bankrupt finances of France. He inquired why
it was that only France, Spain, and Portugal, among the leading states
of Europe, were still without national banks, and why it was that
France, with a soil so fruitful and men so clever, was nevertheless
lying prostrate in economic stagnation. Philippe agreed to let him
establish, as a private venture, a Banque Generate (1716). It accepted
deposits, paid interest, made loans, and issued bank notes — for ten, a
hundred, and a thousand francs — whose steady value, tied to a fixed
weight of silver, soon made them a preferred medium of exchange. These
notes constituted the first regular paper money, and Law’s bank, with
its provincial branches, set up the first organized credit system in
France. In April, 1717, the notes of the bank were made receivable for
taxes.</p>
<p>In September Law advanced to a more adventurous stage of his ideas.
He secured from the Regent a concession to a new Compagnie d’Occident
for the exploitation of the whole Mississippi basin, then under French
con- trol. He sold to the public 200,000 shares in this Company of the
West at 500 livres per share; it was a high price, but three quarters of
the payment could be made in billets d’etat — government notes — at
their face value, which was thrice their actual worth. Glad of this
opportunity .to exchange depreciated paper for shares in a
profit-promising enterprise, the public soon took up all the shares.
With swelling optimism Law instructed his bank to buy the royal tobacco
monopoly, and all French companies handling foreign trade; these he
combined with the Compagnie d’Occident in a Compagnie des Indes, which
was to monopolize all foreign commerce. A socialism of external trade
seemed to some businessmen to presage a socialism</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>of internal production and distribution; opposition to Law began to
form.</p>
<p>On December 4, 1718, Law’s bank was reconstituted as the Banque</p>
<p>Royale; its notes were declared legal tender, and it was given almost
full cont rol of the nation’s finances. He issued new stock in the
Compagnie des Indes at 550 livres the share; it was soon subscribed.
Expectation of high returns raised the public estimate of the shares’
worth; they were exchanged</p>
<p>stopped to lecture the crowd for its fanatic greed. Tiny stalls in
the little street fetched higher rentals per month than houses had
brought in twenty years. Residents complained that the noise was
unbearable. Still the buyers shouted their competing offers; the price
of a share rose almost daily, some- times hourly; at the end of 1719
some were sold for 12,000 livres each; by that time the market value of
all outstanding shares was eighty times greater than the worth of all
the known gold and silver in France. 20 Since only ten per cent of its
face value had to be paid for a share, turnovers were rapid, and
fortunes were made in a day. A banker made 100 million livres, a hotel
waiter thirty million. 21 Now for the first time men heard the word
millionaire . 22</p>
<p>Law was the man of the hour. In 1720 he was made comptroller general
of finances. Highflown lords and ladies fluttered in his anteroom,
seeking his advice in money matters or his support in court intrigues.
“I myself,” Voltaire would recall, “saw him pass through the galleries
of the Palais - Royal followed by dukes and peers, marshals of France,
bishops of the Church.” 23 A duchess humbly kissed his hand.</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>He was not visibly spoiled by the apparent triumph of his ideas, or
by the exaltation of his personal power; indeed, he was alarmed by the
exag- gerated value that public avidity had placed upon the shares of
the com- pany. 24 He took no advantage of his position to swell his own
wealth. Saint-Simon, who opposed the System, declared:</p>
<p>There was neither avarice nor roguery in his composition. He was
a</p>
<p>gentle, good, respectable man, whom excess of credit and fortune had
not spoiled, and whose deportment, equipage, table, and furniture</p>
<p>could not scandalize anyone. He suffered with singular patience and
constancy all vexations excited by his operations, until toward the last
… he became quick and bad-tempered.</p>
<p>Some of the nobility frowned upon him as an alien and a Protestant,
and noted that he and his English wife, though they seemed devoted to
each other, were not legally married. To reduce this hostility Law
accepted French citizenship and the Roman Catholic faith.</p>
<p>He used his power to spur the prosperity of his adopted country. He
reduced taxes and put an end to their clumsy and corrupt collection by
private agencies. He showed for the masses a sympathy unusual in finan-
ciers. He broke up, for cultivation by the peasantry, large estates held
by the Church or by corporations; he went so far as to propose, soon
after being made comptroller general, that the Church be compelled to
sell all the property it had acquired since 1600 — that is, half of all
its French posses- sions. 25 He anticipated Turgot by abolishing duties
on the movement of food and goods within France. He organized the
building or repair of roads, bridges, and canals. He brought in skilled
artisans from abroad to establish new industries; he encouraged
industrial expansion by lowering the rate of interest on loans; French
enterprises increased sixty per cent in the two years (1719-20) of his
ascendancy. He revived and multiplied the merchant marine by expanding
trade with Asia, Africa, and America; French ships engaged in foreign
trade numbered sixteen in March, 1719, three hundred in June, 1720;
French foreign commerce, under Law, reached again the zenith it had
touched under Colbert. He persuaded French nobles to finance the
production of coffee and tobacco in Louisi- ana, and himself financed
the development of the Arkansas River area. In 1718 New Orleans was
founded, and took the Regent’s family name.</p>
<p>Despite the many-sided efforts of Law and Philippe, the American
enter- prise did not prosper. Much of the Mississippi Valley was still
unconquered wilderness. Every effort was made to settle the region with
French colon- ists. Law offered dowries and 450 acres to emigrating
families. When emi- gration proved less attractive than speculation,
prisoners, vagabonds, and prostitutes were deported to Louisiana, and
young men and women (like</p>
<p>H THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. I</p>
<p>the Manon Lescaut of Prevost’s novel) were pressed into the venture
by stratagem or force. Such victims were so badly fed that many of them
died on the way. Edicts of May, 1720, stopped this barbarous
impressment. In the colony itself poor equipment, bad management, and
rebellion hampered economic improvement, and made the earnings of the
“Mississippi Com - pany” (as the people called it) far less than
speculation had presumed. Hopes of gold or precious stones to be mined
from the colonial soil proved illusory, though Law himself had
entertained that dream.</p>
<p>News of these difficulties must have reached France. The cleverest of
the speculators judged that the shares of the company had touched their
peak, and that it was now time to sell. They made great profits by
selling promptly; thousands of others, equally greedy but poorer in
information or judgment, were ruined by selling too late. In December,
1719, the selling became more eager and competitive than the buying.
Within a month the Due de Bourbon disposed of his shares for twenty
million livres; the Prince de Conti sold his for fourteen million; three
wagons were needed to cart away the gold that Law did not dare refuse
the Prince for his bank notes and company shares. 26 A Prussian
speculator unloaded his holdings and departed with thirty million livres
in gold. Others cashed their shares to buy land, houses, jewelry, and
other articles whose worth rested on the solid base of human need or
vanity. The financiers who had been punished by the Chamber of Justice
revenged themselves by cashing their notes and sending the gold out of
France. Law tried to stop the drain of gold from the treasury by
securing from the Regent edicts forbidding the public to hold, trade, or
export the precious metals, and requiring the surrender of all gold and
silver above the value of five hundred francs to the Banque Royale.
Agents of the bank were empowered to enter homes and search for hidden
precious metal; even Louis XIV had never ventured upon such an invasion
of privacy. “Many people,” according to Saint -Simon, “hid their money
with so much secrecy that, dying without being able to say where they
had put it, their little treasures remained buried and lost to their
heirs.” 27</p>
<p>As the price of shares continued to decline, Law tried to bolster it
by offering 9,000 livres (in paper money) per share; but the consequent
in- crease in bank notes lowered their value and raised the price of
goods. By May, 1720, .prices had risen one hundred per cent, wages
seventy-five per cent, as compared with 1716; by July a pair of silk
stockings brought forty livres. A panic of inflation set in; men rushed
to exchange paper currency and stock certificates for goods; so the Due
de La Force amassed candles, and the Marechal d’Estrees piled up stores
of coffee and chocolate. To check this flight from money to goods, Law
announced (May 21) a fifty per cent reduction in the official value of
bank notes and company</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>r 5</p>
<p>shares. It was a serious error — perhaps due to pressure from the
frightened Regent, who himself felt the pressure of Law’s noble and
clerical foes. 28 Philippe tried to ease the crisis by restoring all his
company shares to the bank. 29</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the wave of selling continued. In July the bank was
com- pelled to suspend payment on any of its notes above ten francs.
Holders of the notes besieged the bank, clamoring for the redemption of
their paper in silver or gold. In Paris the crowd was so great that ten
women were trampled to death in the confusion; later three of the
corpses were carried in an angry procession beneath the windows of the
Regent. The people, whose mad speculation had caused the collapse of the
System, held Law responsible for all difficulties. Attempts were made to
seize and kill him; these failing, his coach was smashed to pieces in
the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. Repeated riots expressed the feeling
of the public that it had been deceived by financial tricks, and that
the upper classes had profited at the expense of the community.
Parlement joined in the attacks upon Law; Philippe banished it to
Pontoise (July 20); the people defended the Parlement.</p>
<p>In August the shares of the Mississippi Company, which at their peak
had reached 12,000 livres, fell to 2,000, and the bank notes dropped to
ten per cent of their original worth. In October the news leaked out —
and spread from mouth to mouth — that the Regent, during the prosperity
of the Banque Royale, had drawn from it notes to the total face value of
three billion francs, of which a large part had been consumed in lavish
gifts to friends and mistresses. About the same time a cashier of the
bank absconded to Prussia with an enormous quantity of its gold. The
shares of the Missis- sippi Company fell to 200 livres. In December the
Regent abolished the bank, dismissed Law, and recalled the Parlement. On
the fourteenth, Law left France with his son. He had sunk his own
fortune into the Compagnie des Indes, and shared the fate of most
shareholders; he had deposited no funds abroad; now he took with him
only two thousand livres and a few mediocre gems. At Brussels he
received from Peter the Great an invitation to come and take charge of
Russia’s finances; he refused. He retired to Venice, was joined by his
wife and daughter, lived in obscurity and pov- erty, and died there in
1729.</p>
<p>The principles upon which he had established his bank were
theoretically sound; they would have made France solvent and prosperous
had it not been for the incredible avidity of speculators and the
extravagance of the Re gent. Law’s own accounts, on examination, were
found to be without fault. Temporarily the French economy was left
apparently in ruins: shareholders and noteholders were demanding
impossible payment, the circulation of money was almost paralyzed,
industry was hesitating, foreign</p>
<p>i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>commerce was becalmed, prices were beyond the capacity of the people
to pay. The Regent summoned the brothers Paris to make some order out of
the chaos. They called in all bank notes and redeemed their diverse
categories with liens on the national revenue, at a loss of sixteen to
ninety- five per cent to the holders. The public, its fury exhausted,
submitted patiently to this practical bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Something remained from the debacle. Agriculture benefited from the
rise in the value of its products and the depreciation of the currency.
In- dustry, stimulated by low interest and high prices, recovered
rapidly; new enterprises appeared everywhere. Internal trade profited
from the reduction of internal tolls; commerce, when the chaos subsided,
resumed its extension overseas. The middle classes, in whom the pursuit
of gain was natural and necessary, emerged unscathed and enlarged.
Financiers multiplied in num- ber and power. The nobility gained by
paying its debts in cheapened cur- rency, but lost face by having shown,
in the fever of speculation, a con- cupiscence as blatant as in any
class. The Regency remained tarnished with its faithlessness to its
financial obligations and its continued luxury amid widespread disaster.
An anonymous critic complained that “it will take centuries to eradicate
the evil which Law is responsible for in having ac- customed the people
to ease and luxury, in having made them discontented with their
condition, in having raised the price of food and manual labor, and in
making all classes of tradespeople look for exorbitant profits.” 30 But
that same commercial spirit stimulated the economy and the intellect of
France, while lowering the moral tone of French society. By 1722 the
French economy had recovered sufficiently to let the Regent return, with
the easy conscience of a government, to his wonted ways of kindly rule
and generous adultery.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE REGENT</li>
</ol>
<p>His German mother had warned him to check his amiability. “It is
better to be kind than harsh,” she told him, “but justice consists in
punishing as well as rewarding; and it is certain that he who does not
make Frenchmen fear him will soon fear them, for they despise those who
do not intimidate them.” 31 Philippe, molded by Montaigne, admired
English liberty, and spoke optimistically about having subjects who
would not obey him blindly, but would be intelligent enough to let him
explain to them</p>
<p>the reasons for his laws. He symbolized the spirit of his regime by
abandon- ing Versailles and coming to live in the Palais-Royal, in the
heart and fever of Paris. He disliked the ceremonies jind publicity of
court life, and put them behind him. For further ease and privacy he
arranged that the young</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>King should live not at Versailles but in the chateau of suburban
Vincennes. Far from poisoning the boy, as gossip alleged, Philippe
showed him every kindness and all due subordination, so that Louis XV
preserved throughout his life a grateful remembrance of the care which
the Regent had lavished upon him. 32</p>
<p>Two days after Louis XIV had been buried, Philippe ordered the
release from the Bastille of all prisoners except those known to have
been guilty of serious crimes against society. Hundreds of these men had
been imprisoned by secret letters ( lettres de cachet) of the late King;
most of them were Jansenists accused only of religious nonconformity;
others had been incar- cerated so long that no one, not even themselves,
knew the cause. One man, arrested thirty-five years before, had never
been brought to trial or told the reason of his confinement; released in
his old age, he found himself bewildered by freedom; he did not know a
soul in Paris, and had not a sou; he begged, and was allowed, to remain
in the Bastille to the end of his life.</p>
<p>The dead King’s confessor, Michel Le Tellier, who had hounded the</p>
<p>Jansenists, was banished from Paris. The Regent advised the opposing
fac- tions in the Church to quiet their disputes. He winked an eye at
clandestine Protestants, and appointed several of them to administrative
posts. He wished to renew the liberal Edict of Nantes, but the Jesuits
and the Jan- senists united in denouncing such toleration, and his
minister Dubois, angling for a cardinal’s hat, dissuaded him. 33 “The
justice refused to the Protestants</p>
<p>Politically, and even when he sent Voltaire to the Bastille, Philippe
was a liberal and enlightened ruler. He explained his ordinances to the
people in terms so moderate and sincere that Michelet saw in them a
herald of the Constituent Assembly of 1789. 36 Offices were filled with
able men regard- less of their enmity to the Regent himself; one who had
threatened him with assassination was made chief of the Council of
Finance. 37 Philippe, by nature epicurean, remained a stoic till 5 p.m.;
till then, says Saint-Simon, “he devoted himself exclusively to public
business, rece ption of ministers, councils, etc., never dining during
the day, but taking chocolate between two and three o’clock, when
everybody was allowed to enter his room . . . His familiarity and his
readiness of access extremely pleased people, but were much abused.” 38
“Of all the race of Henry IV”— that is, of all the Bourbons — said
Voltaire, “Philippe d’Orleans resembled that monarch the most in his
courage, goodness of heart, openness, gaiety, affability, and</p>
<p>i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>freedom of access, and with an understanding better cultivated.” 39
He dis - concerted ambassadors and councilors by the range of his
knowledge, the penetration of his mind, the wisdom of his judgment. 40
But he shared the weakness of philosophers — the ability and willingness
to see so many sides to a subject that time was absorbed in discussion,
and decisive action was deferred.</p>
<p>Liberal though he was, he would not tolerate any abridgment of the
traditional royal authority. When Parlement, availing itself of the
privilege of remonstrance which he had promised it, refused to register
some of his decrees (i.e., to enter them among the recognized laws of
the land), he summoned it (August 25, 1718) to a famous lit de justice —
a session at which the King, seated on a “bed” of judgment, exercised
his sovereignty to compel the registration of a royal edict. The 153
magistrates, solemn in their scarlet robes, walked on foot to the
Tuileries. The young King, follow- ing Philippe’s instructions, ordere d
them — and they proceeded — to register the Regent’s decrees. Since the
Due and Duchesse du Maine had continued to oppose him in council and by
intrigues, he took the occasion to deprive the royal bastards of their
status as princes of the blood. The legitimate dukes were restored to
their former precedence and rights, to the delight of the Due de
Saint-Simon, to whom this was the greatest achievement of the Regency,
and the noblest moment of his Memoires.</p>
<p>The Duchesse du Maine did not accept defeat. She financed some of the
wits who pricked the Regent with lampoons. He tolerated these barbs with
the patience of St. Sebastian, excepting, as we shall see, the
Philippiques and the J’ai - vus (“I -have- seens”) attributed to
Voltaire. In December, 1718, the Duchess entered into a conspiracy with
Cellamare, the Spanish ambas- sador, with Alberoni, the Spanish premier,
and with Cardinal Melchior de Polignac to overthrow the Regent and make
Philip V of Spain king of France, with the Due du Maine as his chief
minister. The conspiracy was discovered, the ambassador was dismissed,
the Duke and Duchess were sent to separate prisons, from which they were
released in 1721. The Duke claimed ignorance of the plot. The Duchess
resumed her court and in- trigues at Sceaux.</p>
<p>Amid these harassments, and within the limits of tradition and his
char- acter, Philippe undertook some moderate reforms. More roads were
built during his brief tenure than in Louis XIV’s half century. He saved
millions of francs by abandoning Marly and Versailles, and keeping a
numerically modest court. Many of Law’s innovations survived in a more
economical and merciful collection of taxes, and the dismissal of
taxgatherers accused of corruption or waste. Philippe contemplated a
graduated income tax: he tried it in Normandy, in Paris, and at La
Rochelle; it lapsed with his pre-</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>mature death. He did his best to keep France out of war; he
demobilized thousands of troops, and settled them on uncultivated land;
he housed the remaining soldiers in barracks instead of quartering them
upon the people. With generous vision he opened the University of Paris
and the Biblio- theque Royale to all qualified students without charge;
the state paid their tuition . 41 He supported with public funds the
Academie Royale des Sciences, the Academie Royale des Inscriptions et
Belles-Lettres, the Academie Royale de l’Architecture; he financed the
publication of learn ed works; he established in the Louvre an Academie
des Arts Mecaniques to promote invention and the industrial arts . 42 He
gave pensions to artists, scholars, and savants, provided rooms for them
in the royal palaces, and loved to talk with these men about their
diverse pursuits. His measures and reforms fell short of full fruition
partly because of the incubus of debt and the collapse of Law’s
financial revolution, and partly through the Regent’s own physical and
moral defects.</p>
<p>It is one of the pitiful tragedies in the history of France that this
man with so many virtues of mind and heart was sullied and weakened with
the debauchery of his class and time. Son of a sexual invert, tutored by
an ecclesiastical rake, he grew up almost devoid of restraint in sexual
indul- gence.. “He would have had virtues,” said Duclos, “if one could
have them without principles .” 43 Forced to marry an illegitimate
daughter of Louis XIV, and finding no love or comfort in his wife, he
took to frequent drunk- enness, and to such a concatenation of
mistresses as no ruler has equaled out- side of Islamic seraglios. He
chose his male friends among roisterers whom he called roues, who spent
fortunes in venery and furnished their homes with costly art and sexual
stimulants . 44 In the Palais-Royal, or in his villa at St. -Cloud,
Philippe joined his friends — mostly young nobles, but also some
cultivated Englishmen like Lords Stair and Stanhope — in petits soupers
where cultured women like Mme. du Deffand mingled with actresses, divas,
and mistresses in providing feminine stimulation to male wit. Says
Saint- Simon, with possibly some sanctimonious coloration:</p>
<p>At these parties the character of everyone was passed in review,</p>
<p>ministers and favorites like the rest, with a liberty which was
unbridled license. The gallantries past and present of the court and the
town, all the old stories, disputes, jokes, absurdities, were raked up;
nobody was spared; M. le Due d’ Orleans had his say like the rest. But
very rarely did these discourses make the slightest impression upon him.
The com- pany drank as much as they could, inflamed themselves, said the
filthiest things without stint, uttered impieties with emulation; and
when they had made a good deal of noise and were very drunk, they went
to bed to recommence the same game the next day . 45</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Philippe’s restless, uprooted spirit expressed itself in the brief
tenure of</p>
<p>This same paragon of promiscuity loved his mother, visited her twice
daily, and meekly bore her sorrowful reprimands. He did not love his
wife, but he gave her attentions and courtesy, and found time to have
five chil- dren by her. He loved his children, grieved when his youngest
daughter took to a nunnery, and let no day pass without visiting, in the
Luxembourg Palace, his oldest daughter, whose life was almost as sad a
scandal as his own.</p>
<p>Her marriage with Charles, Due de Berry, soon became an oscillation
of war and truce. Having caught him in alien arms, she agreed to smile
upon his infidelities if he would condone her own; a contemporary
chronicle adds that “they undertook to protect each other.” 47
Granddaughter of “Mon - sieur le Sodomite,” and scion of a Bavarian
family with insanity in its blood, she found stability of mind or morals
beyond her power; and her con- sciousness of her faults heated a haughty
temper that alarmed all who entered her life. She took full advantage of
her derivation, rode through Paris like a queen, and kept at the
Luxembourg a luxurious menage, some- times with eight hundred servants.
48 When her husband died (1714) she entertained a succession of lovers.
She shocked everyone by her drunken- ness and debauchery, indecent
language, and scornful pride; and her fits of piety alternated with
skeptical sallies against religion.</p>
<p>She seems never to have loved anyone so much as her father, nor he
any- one so much as her. She shared his intelligence, sensitivity, and
wit along with his morals, and her beauty in youth rivaled that of his
choicest mis- tresses. The gossip of Paris, having no heart and knowing
no law, accused them of incest; for good measure it added that he had
committed incest with all three of his daughters. 49 Probably some of
these rumors were set afloat by the circle of Adme. du Maine. 50
Saint-Simon, closest to the situa- tion, rejected them as base
cruelties; Philippe himself never bothered to deny them. His complete
freedom from jealousy of his daughter’s lovers, 51</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>and her lack of jealousy of his mistresses 52 hardly accord with the
possessive character of love. 53</p>
<p>Only one man could detach her from her father — Captain Rion of her
palace guard, who so entranced her with his masculinity that she became
his slave. In 1719 she shut herself in at the Luxembourg with a few
attendants, and gave birth to the captain’s daughter. Soon afterward she
secretly married him. She begged her father to let her announce this
marriage; he refused; her love for him turned into a mad resentment. She
fell sick, neglected herself, developed an alarming fever, and died,
aged twenty-four, of a purgative administered by her doctor (July 21,
1719). An autopsy re- vealed some malformations in her brain. No bishop
would consent to offi- ciate at her funeral, and Philippe was humbly
grateful when the monks of St.-Denis allowed her remains to be deposited
in the royal vaults of their abbey church. Her mot her rejoiced at her
daughter’s death; her father buried himself in the emptiness of
power.</p>
<p>V. SOCIETY UNDER THE REGENCY</p>
<p>The growth of wealth in France between the Edict of Nantes (1598)</p>
<p>and its Revocation (1685), the urbanization of life, and the decline
of re- ligious belief after the religious wars and the Jansenist
disputes, had pro- duced in the nobility a relaxation of morals
symbolized by Louis XIV in the youth of his reign. The marriage of the
King to Mme. de Maintenon (1685), his conversion to monogamy and
morality, and the sobering effect of military disasters, had compelled
his court to change at least its external ways; and the self-reforms of
the clergy had for a generation checked the weakening of the Church. The
freethinkers had censored their own pub- lications, and the epicureans
had kept their revels from public view. But when the stern and repentant
King was succeeded by the skeptical, licen- tious, and tolerant Regent,
these restraints fell away, and the resentment of suppressed instincts
broke out in a wave of irreligion and self-indulgence similar to the
sensual riot of English society in Restoration England after a
generation of Puritan ascendancy ( 1642-60). Immorality was now a badge
of liberation and sophistication; “debauchery became a kind of
etiquette.” 54</p>
<p>Christianity was in decline long before the Ency clopedie attacked
it, even before Voltaire first aimed at it the darts of his pen. Dupuy
in 1717 com- plained of the large number of materialists in Paris. 55
“Today,” said Massil - lon in 1718, “ungodliness almost lends an air of
distinction and glory; it is a merit that gives access to the great, . .
. that procures for obscure men the privilege of familiarity with the
people’s prince.” 56 That prince’s mother, shortly before her death in
1722, wrote: “I do not believe that</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>there are in Paris, either among ecclesiastics or people of the
world, one hundred persons who have a true Christian faith and really
believe in our Saviour; and this makes me tremble.” 57 Few of the
younger generation thought of going from Catholicism to Protestantism;
they went to atheism, which was much safer. The Cafes Procope and
Gradot, like the Temple, were the rendezvous of unbelieving wits.</p>
<p>If irreligion shared in releasing moral laxity in the upper class,
poverty co-operated with the natural lawlessness of men in producing
moral chaos among the lower strata of Pa ris. The learned Lacroix
calculated that “the dangerous characters, beggars, vagabonds, thieves,
swindlers of every de- scription, formed perhaps a sixth of the people”;
58 and we may assume that</p>
<p>But in the nobility at Paris, in the floating gentry of the town, in
the</p>
<p>addicts of literature or art, in the financiers and the abbes
commendataires, the moral precepts seemed quite forgotten, and
Christianity was remem- bered only for a Sunday social hour. The double
standard, which had sought to protect the inheritance of property by
making the infidelity of the wife a far graver offense than that of the
husband, was left behind when the wife came to Paris or Versailles;
there the wife who confined her favors to her husband was considered
old-fashioned; there women rivaled the men in tying and untying knots.
Marriage was accepted to preserve the family, its possessions, and its
name; but beyond that no fidelity was demanded, by the mores of the time
and class, from either the husband or the wife. 60 In the Middle Ages
marriage had been counted on to lead to love; now mar- riage as seldom
led to love as love to marriage; and even in adultery there was little
pretense of love. Here and there, however, a faithful couple shone as a
brave exception amid the kaleidoscopic crowd: the Duke and Duchess of
Saint-Simon, the Count and Countess of Toulouse, M. and Mme. de Luynes,
M. and Mme. de Pontchartrain, M. and Mme. de Belle-Isle. Many reckless
wives graduated into subdued and exemplary grandmothers. Some, their
charms worn out with circulation, retired to comfortable convents, and
distributed charity and wisdom.</p>
<p>One of the most enterprising women of the Regency was Claudine Alex-
andrine de Tencin. She bounced out of a nunnery at the age of thirty-two
into a giddy progression of liaisons. She had excuses: her father was a
sue-</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>cessful philanderer as well as president of the Parlement of
Grenoble; her mother was a flighty coquette; and Claudine herself was
conscious of a beauty that itched to be sold. Her older sister Mme. de
Grolee was only less promiscuous; in her deathbed confession at the age
of eighty-seven she explained, “I was young, I was pretty; men told me
so and I believed them; guess at the rest.” 61 Claudine’s older brother
Pierre took holy orders, and made his way through many women to a
cardinal’s hat and the archbishop- ric of Lyons. To save a dowry
Claudine’s father entered her into a con - vent at Montfleury. There she
fretted in reluctant piety for sixteen years. In 1713, aged thirty-two,
she escaped, and hid in the room of the Chevalier Destouches, an
artillery officer, with whose aid she became (1717) the mother of the
philosopher d’Alembert. Not foreseeing the Ency clopedie in this infant,
she exposed him on the steps of the Church of St.-Jean-le-Rond in Paris.
She passed on to Matthew Prior and Lord Bolingbroke and Marc Rene de
Voyer d’Argenson, and then flung herself— allegedly after posing as a
nude statue 62 — into the arms of the Regent himself. Her stay there was
brief; she tried to transmute her caresses into a benefice for her
beloved brother; Philippe replied that he did not like wenches who
talked business between sheets; 63 he ordered his doors closed to her.
She picked herself up and conquered Dubois. We shall meet her again.</p>
<p>Amid this moral flux some women of Paris carried on the distinctive
French virtue of assembling titles, intellect, and beauty in salons. The
most polished society in the capital gathered in the architectural
splendor of the Hotel de Sully; there came statesmen, financiers, poets
— Fontenelle in his silent sixties, Voltaire in his brash twenties. A
more lighthearted group met at the Hotel de Bouillon, which Lesage
immortalized in an angry moment: invited to read there his play T ur
caret, and arriving late, he was haughtily reproved by the Duchess, “You
have made us lose an hour”; he replied, “I will make you gain twice the
time,” and left the house. 64 We have noted the salon of Mme. du Maine
at Sceaux. Marguerite Jeanne Cordier de Launay, who was to be Baronne de
Staal, served the Duchess as lady in waiting, and wrote bright Memoir es
(published in 1755) describing the comedies, conceits, fetes-de-nuit,
and masquerades that left scant room for conversa- tion amid les
divertissements de Sceaux.</p>
<p>But conversation dominated the salon that Anne Therese de Courcelles,
Marquise de Lambert, held in the Hotel de Nevers (now the Bibliotheque
Nationale). Rich but austere, she continued into the riotous Regency the
staid and stately manners of Louis XIV’s declining years. She
discouraged cardplaying, chess, even music; she was all for intellect.
Like the Marquise du Chatelet, she was interested in science and
philosophy, and sometimes (says Voltaire) she talked above her own head;
but the head was pretty and titled, which made any metaphysic
effervesce. Every Tuesday she enter-</p>

<p>tained scientists and aristocrats; every Wednesday, writers, artists,
and scholars, including Fontenelle, Montesquieu, and Marivaux. At her
gather- ings savants gave lectures, authors read their forthcoming
books, and liter- ary reputations were made; from that bureau cT esprit,
or ministry of mind, this generous and ambitious hostess waged a score
of successful campaigns to get her proteges into the French Academy. She
was one of the hundreds of gracious, cultured, civilized women who make
the history of France the most fascinating story in the world.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>WATTEAU AND THE ARTS</li>
</ol>
<p>A revolution in art mirrored the change in politics and morals. After
the collapse of Louis XIV’s imperialistic policy in the War of the
Spanish Suc - cession ( 1 702-1 3 ) , the spirit of France turned from
the gore of glory to the pleasures of peace. The mood of the time found
no need for new churches, more use for city mansions like the Hotel
Matignon and the Palais-Bourbon (1721-22). Excepting such architectural
immensities, dwellings and rooms became smaller now, but their
decoration was more delicate and refined. Baroque began to pass into
rococo:* i.e., the style of irregular forms and abundant ornament took a
turn toward an almost brittle elegance, running to playful and
incalculable fantasy. The delight in exquisite finish, bright colors,
and surprising evolutions of design became a mark of the style Regence.
The classical orders disappeared under a frolic of dainty curves,
corners were concealed, moldings were lavishly carved. Sculpture aban-
doned the Olympian grandeur of Versailles for smaller forms of graceful
movement and emotional appeal. Furniture shunned right angles and
straight lines, and aimed at comfort rather than dignity. Now came the
siege ft deux, the armchair built for two, designed for friends and
lovers re- senting the pathos of distance. Charles Cressent, chief
cabinetmaker to the Regent, established the Regency style with chairs,
tables, desks, and bureaus brilliant with mother-of-pearl marquetry and
gay with conscious loveli- ness.</p>
<p>Philippe himself, in person, manners, and tastes, symbolized the
transition to rococo. When he moved the government from Versailles to
Paris he brought art down from the classic sobriety of Louis XIV to the
lighter spirit of the capital, and he directed the wealth of the
bourgeoisie to the patronage of art. He was patron ex officio and par
excellence; he was rich in his own right, and paid handsomely. His taste
was not for grandeur or massive display, nor for the traditional
pictorial themes of religion, legend,</p>

<p>or history, but for minor masterpieces of perfect workmanship
tempting the fingers and opening the eyes, like jeweled caskets, silver
vessels, golden bowls, fanciful chinoiseries, and paintings of luscious
women dressed in nature by Rubens or Titian, or swaying in Veronese’s
gorgeous robes. His art collection in the Palais-Royal was thrown open
to all responsible visitors; it would have rivaled any collection had it
not been for his mistresses, who asked and received. Artists came to his
rooms to study and copy, and Philippe went to their studios to watch and
learn. To Charles Antoine Coypel, his premier peintre, he spoke with
characteristic courtesy and modesty: “I am happy and proud, monsieur, to
receive your advice, and to avail myself of your lessons.” 65 He would
have been a highly civilized man had he not suffered from thirst and an
uncontrollable appreciation of beauty.</p>
<p>The quality of the age expressed itself most clearly in painting.
Liber- ated by the Regent and their new patrons, artists like Watteau,
Pater, Lancret, and Lemoyne discarded the rules that Le Brun had laid
down in the Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts. They responded willingly to
the demand for pictures that would reflect the Regent’s appetite for
beauty and pleasure, the vivacious grace of Regency women, the warm
colors of Regency furniture and drapes, the gay parties in the Bois de
Boulogne, the games and masquerades of the court at Sceaux, the fluid
morals of actors, actresses, prima donnas, and danseuses. The pagan
mythology replaced the grim stories of somber saints; strange figures
from China, Turkey, Persia, or India let the released mind roam freely
through exotic dreams; idyllic pastorals supplanted heroic “histories”;
portraits of purchasers superseded the exploits of kings.</p>
<p>Some painters already famous under Louis XIV continued to flourish in
the Regency. Antoine Coypel, after adorning Versailles in the correct
style of the old court, painted in the Palais-Royal ladies in alluring
neglige. Nicolas de Largilliere, already fifty-nine when the Grand
Monarque died, carried on for thirty years more; he hangs in pride and
wig, with wife and daughter, in the inexhaustible Louvre. Alexandre
Frangois Desportes, who died at eighty-two in 1743, was now painting
spacious landscapes, like the Pay sage d’lle de France in the Musee de
Compiegne. Frangois Lemoyne, who killed himself at forty-nine (1737),
decorated the Church of St.- Sulpice piously, then warmed the Salon d’
Hercule at Versailles with vo - luptuous forms that would be inherited
by Boucher. And Claude Gillot, designer of scenery and costumes for the
stage, engraver of landscapes and theatrical tableaux, introduced that
style of fetes champetres which we associate with his pupil Antoine
Watteau.</p>
<p>Antoine was a Fleming, bom to a tiler in Valenciennes (1684). Flemish
influences first molded him — the paintings of Rubens, Ostade, and
Teniers,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>and the teaching of a local painter, Jacques Gerin. When Gerin
died</p>
<p>(1702), Watteau advanced to Paris, penniless. He earned his bread by
assisting a scene painter, then by working in a factory that turned out
small portraits and devotional pictures wholesale. His wages were three
francs a week plus enough food to keep him alive and let him develop
tubercu- losis. Another fever burned in him — the hunger for greatness
and fame. He gave his evenings and holidays to drawing persons and
places from nature. One of these sketches struck the eye and fancy of
Gillot, who was painting panels for the Comedie-Italienne; he invited
Watteau to join him. Antoine came, and fell in love with the actors; he
painted incidents from</p>
<p>their hectic lives, their reckless shifting loves, their games and
picnics, their voluble panic when Mme. de Maintenon, offended by their
satire, restricted them to pantomime. Watteau captured the pathos of
their instability, the comical expressions of their faces, the folds of
their strange costumes; and he gave these pictures a gleaming texture
that may have stirred some jealousy in Gillot. In any case master and
pupil quarreled and parted, and Antoine moved to the studio of Claude
Audran in the Luxembourg. There he studied with awe Rubens’ pictorial
apotheosis of Marie de Medicis; and in the gardens he found vistas of
trees and clouds that lured his pencil or brush.</p>
<p>Those were bitter years when French boys were being hurried off to
one battlefield after another in the long War of the Spanish Succession.
Their immolation was duly prefaced by patriotic parades and pathetic
farewells; Watteau described them in The Departure of the Troops with
such deli- cacy of feeling and technique that Audran in turn took alarm
at being sur- passed. Hoping to win the Prix de Rome, Antoine entered
the competition offered by the Academie Royale de Peinture et de
Sculpture in 1709; he won only the second prize, but the Academy
enrolled him as a member in</p>
<ol start="1712" type="1">
<li>After many minor efforts, he reached the crest of his curve with The
Embarkation for Cythera (1717), now one of the choicest treasures of the
Louvre. All Paris applauded it; the delighted Regent made him an
official painter to the King, and the Duchesse de Berry commissioned him
to decorate her Chateau La Muette. He worked feverishly, as if knowing
that he had only four more years to live. Antoine Crozat, who rivaled
Philippe himself as a patron of art, offered Watteau board and bed in
his commodious hStel; there the younger Antoine studied the finest
collection yet gathered by a private citizen. For Crozat he painted four
decorative panels, The Seasons. Soon dissatisfied with luxury, he moved
from place to place, even to London (1719); but coal dust and fog drove
him back to Paris, where he lived for a time with the art dealer
Gersaint. For him Antoine painted, in eight mornings, two sides of a
signboard showing fashionable Parisians examining pictures in a shop;
over the casual realism</li>

characteristic</p>
<p>thirty-seven.</p>
<p>His long illness infected his character and his art. Slender and
ailing, nervous and diffident, easily tired, seldom smiling and rarely
gay, he kept his sorrow out of his art, and painted life as his wishes
saw it — a panorama of lively actors and lissome women, an ode to
wistful joy. Too frail for sensuality, he maintained amid the license of
the Regency a decency of morals which was reflected in the temper of his
work. He painted a few nudes, but they held no fleshly lure; for the
rest his women wore radiant costumes tiptoeing through the vestibules of
love. His brush fluctuated between the vicissitudes of actors, the
rituals of courtship, and the kalei- doscope of the sky. He clothed V
Indifferent 69 in the costliest, laciest rai- ment he could imagine. He
pictured The French Comedians 67 in a dramatic scene, and caught the
Italian actor Giuseppe Baletti as Gilles the clown 68 in a brown study
and white pantaloons. He surprised A Guitar Player 69 in a mood of
amorous melancholy, and saw A Music Party 70 entranced by a lute. He
placed his figures against dreamy backgrounds of playful foun- tains,
swaying trees, and gliding clouds, with here and there a pagan statue
echoing Poussin, as in La Fite d Amour 71 or Les Champs-Ely sees . 72 He
loved women from a timid distance, with all the longing of one too weak
to woo; and he was moved not so much by cozy contours as by the luster
of their hair and the sinuous flow of their robes. Upon their garments
he cast all the wizardry of his colors, as if knowing that by such
raiment woman had become the mystery engendering, besides mankind, half
the wit and poetry and adoration of the world.</p>
<p>So he poured his spirit into his most famous picture, UEmbarquement
pour Cy there, in which graceful women, succumbing to male agitation,
em- bark with their courtiers for the isle where Venus, it was said, had
a temple, and had emerged, dripping with beauty, from the sea. Here the
men almost outshine the ladies in the splendor of their dress; but what
charmed the Academy was the overhanging grandeur of the trees, and the
distant island’s snowy crest tinged with the sun and touching clouds.
Watteau liked this subtle theme so well that he painted it in three
variations. And Paris re- sponded by choosing Watteau to carry the
colors of the Regency, to cele- brate the pleasures of life in a regime
that would die as soon as it had spent its youth. He became by official
title the peintre des fetes galantes, the painter of urban lovers
picnicking pastorally in a tranquil countryside, mingling Eros and Pan
in the sole religion of the age. A breath of melan- choly passes over
these seemingly carefree scenes; these pliant sylphs could</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>not be so tender if they had not known some suffering, or could not
guess the brevity of adoration. This is the quality of Watteau — the
delicate render- ing of perfect moments that must pass.</p>
<p>He died too soon to savor his fame. After he was gone connoisseurs
dis- covered his drawings, and some preferred them to his paintings, for
here the chalk or pencil had achieved a finesse of detail in hands and
hair, a sub- tlety of nuance in eyes and pose and flirting fan, that the
oils had never quite revealed. 73 The women of Paris became especially
fond of themselves as seen in the dead artist’s longing; the beau monde
dressed itself a la Watteau, walked and lounged a la Watteau, adorned
its boudoirs and salons as these had been in the shapes and colors of
his vision. The style Watteau entered into the design of furniture, into
the rural motifs of deco- ration and the airy arabesques of rococo.
Artists like Lancret and Pater took over Watteau’s specialty, and
pictured fetes champetres, conversations galantes, musicales in the
park, dances on the green, declarations of love’s eternity. Half the
painting of France through the next one hundred years was a memory of
Watteau. His influence continued through Boucher to Fragonard to
Delacroix to Renoir, and the Impressionists found in his tech- nique
suggestive foreshadowings of their theories of light and shade and mood.
He was, as the captivated Goncourts said, “the great poet of the
eighteenth century.” 74</p>

<p>Under the easy morals and tolerance of the Regency literature
prospered, and heresy found a footing that it never lost again. Theaters
and the opera recovered from the frowns of the late King and Mme. de
Maintenon; Philippe, or some of his household, attended the Opera, the
Opera- Comique, the Theatre-Fran§ais, or the Theatre des Italiens almost
every evening. The Theatre-Franqais, while preserving Corneille, Racine,
and Moliere, opened its stage to fresh plays like Voltaire’s Oedipe, in

<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>happy vein with he Drnble boiteux (1707), which pictured an impish
demon, Asmodeus, perching on a pinnacle in Paris, lifting roofs at will
with his magic wand, and revealing to his friend the private lives and
un- licensed loves of the unsuspecting residents. The result was a
rollicking dis- closure of the sordid schemes, hypocrisies, vices, and
devices of humanity. One lady, surprised by her husband in bed with his
valet, solves a dozen problems at once by crying out that she is being
raped; the husband kills the valet, the lady saves both her virtue and
her life, and dead men tell no tales. Nearly everyone rushed to buy or
borrow the book, delighted to see other people exposed; “two seigneurs
of the court,” said the Journal de Verdun for December, 1707, “fought,
sword in hand, in Barbin’s shop, to get the last c opy of the second
edition.” 76 Sainte -Beuve found almost an epitome of the age in the
remark of Asmodeus about a brother demon with whom he had quarreled: “We
embraced, and since then we are mortal enemies.” 77</p>
<p>Two years later Lesage reached almost the level of Moliere with a</p>
<p>comedy satirizing the financiers. Some of these had advance news of
Tur- caret, and tried to prevent its performance; a story, probably
legendary, pictured them offering the author 100,000 francs to withdraw
the play; 78 the Dauphin, son of Louis XIV, ordered it produced.
Turcaret is a con- tractor-merchant-moneylender who lives in luxury amid
the destitution of war. He is generous only to his mistress, who bleeds
him as sedulously as he bleeds the people. “I marvel at the course of
human life,” says the valet Frontin; “we pluck a coquette; the coquette
devours a man of affairs; the man of affairs pillages others; and all
this makes the most diverting chain of knaveries imaginable.” 79</p>
<p>Perhaps the satire here is unfair and is edged with revenge. In the
most famous of eighteenth-century French novels Lesage succeeded in
depicting a more complex character, and with greater objectivity.
Following Spanish models again, The Adventures of Gil Bias de Santillane
moves in picaresque style through a world of banditry, drinking bouts,
abductions, seductions, and politics, in which cleverness is the supreme
virtue and success pardons all. Gil begins as an innocent youth, tender
with ideals and love of mankind, but credulous, talkative, and vain. He
is captured by robbers, joins them, learns their arts and ways,
graduates from them to the Spanish court, and serves the Duke of Lerma
as aide and pander. “Before I was about the court my nature was
compassionate and charitable; but tenderness of heart is an
unfashionable frailty there, and mine became harder than any flint. Here
was an admirable school to correct the romantic sensibilities of friend-
ship.” 80 He turns his back upon his parent s, and refuses to help them.
His luck fails, he is imprisoned, he resolves to reform; he is released,
retires to the country, marries, and tries to be a good citizen. Finding
this an intol-</p>

<p>erable bore, he returns to the court and its code. He is knighted,
marries again, and is surprised by the virtue of his wife and by his
happiness in her children, of whom “I devoutly believe myself the
father.” 81</p>
<p>Gil Bias became the favorite novel of French readers until Hugo’s Les
Miser ables (1862) challenged its size and supremacy. Lesage loved his
book so well that he spread it over twenty years of his life. The first
two volumes appeared in 1715, the third in 1724, the fourth in 1735;
and, as i n Cervantes’ Don Quixote, the last was as good as the first.
He financed his old age by writing little comedies for the popular
Theatre de la Foire (Theater of the Fair); and in 1738 he issued another
novel, Le Bachelier de Salamanque, padding the book with unacknowledged
pilferings in the manner of the time. He had become almost deaf at
forty, but could hear with a trumpet; lucky man, who could close his
ears at will, as we close our eyes. Toward the end of his life he lost
the use of his faculties “except in the middle of the day,” so that,
said his friends, “his mind seemed to rise and set with the</p>
<p>Lesage’s Gil Bias finds fewer readers today than the Memoires of
Louis de Rouvroy, Due de Saint-Simon. No one loves the Duke now, for he
lacked the modest man’s ability to conceal his vanity. He never forgot
that</p>
<p>I learned the death of the King upon awakening. Immediately after-
ward, I went to pay my respects to the new monarch. … I went thence to
M. le Due d’Orleans; I reminded him of a promise he had given me, that
he would allow the dukes to keep their hats on when their votes were
asked for. 83</p>
<p>He loved the Regent sincerely, served him in the Council of State,
admon- ished him to moderation in mistresses, and comforted him in
bereavements and defeats. Close to events for fifty years, he began in
1694 to record them — from the standpoint of his class — from his own
birth in 1675 to the Regent’s death in 1723. He himself survived till
1755 into an uncongenial age. The Marquise de Crequi set him down as “an
old sick crow, burning with envy and devoured by vanity.” 84 But she was
writing memoirs, too, and could not stomach his obstinate
continuance.</p>
<p>The garrulous Duke was always biased, often unjust in his judgments,
occasionally careless of chronology, 85 sometimes consciously incorrect
in his report; 88 he ignored everything but politics, and lost himself,

volumes are a detailed and precious record by an observant and
penetrating eye and a fluent pen; they enable us to see Mme. de
Maintenon, Fenelon, Philippe d’ Orleans, and Saint -Simon almost as
vividly as Bourrienne allows us to see Napoleon. To give his prejudices
freedom, he tried to keep his memoirs secret, and forbade their
publication within a century of his death. None of them reached print
till 1781, many of them not before 1830. Of all the memoirs that

<li>THE INCREDIBLE CARDINAL</li>
</ol>
<p>If we were to believe Saint-Simon, the most inspiring maxims of our
youth were contradicted by the career of Guillaume Dubois. He had all
the vices, and every success except succes d’estime. Hear Saint-Simon
again on his fellow councilor:</p>
<p>His intellect was of the most ordinary kind; his knowledge the
most</p>
<p>commonplace; his capacity nil; his exterior that of a ferret, of a
pedant; his conversation disagreeable, broken, always uncertain; his
falsehood written upon his features. . . . Nothing was sacred to him. .
. . He had a declared contempt for faith, promises, honor, probity,
truth; took</p>
<p>pleasure in laughing at all these things; was equally voluptuous
and</p>
<p>ambitious. . . . With all this he was soft, cringing, supple, a
flatterer, a false admirer, taking all shapes with the greatest
facility. . . . His judg- ment . . . was involuntarily crooked. . . .
With such defects it is surpris- ing that the only man he was able to
seduce was M. le Due d’Orleans, who had so much intelligence, such a
well-balanced mind, and so much clear and rapid perception of character
87</p>
<p>— which should have led the acidulous author to doubt the
perspicacity of his jealousy. We must confess, however, that Duclos
agrees with Saint- Simon. 88</p>
<p>Dubois was in his sixtieth year when the Regency gave him power. He
was a bit dilapidated, having survived several venereal diseases, 89 but
he was able to entertain Mme. de Tencin when she fell out of Philippe’s
arms. In any case he must have had some intellectual acumen, for he
managed foreign affairs reasonably well. He took a fat bribe from
Britain to do what he thought was good for France. The Whigs in England
and Emperor Charles VI in Austria were plotting to repudiate the Treaty
of Utrecht and renew the war against France. Philip V, not content with
the throne of Spain, was itching to be king of France, and thought an
entente with England would clear his way. If England, Spain, Austria,
and the Austrian Netherlands (“Belgium”) should unite in another Grand
Alliance, the old</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>circumvallation of France would rise again, and all the policies and
victories of Richelieu and Louis XIV would be annulled. To forestall
such a union Dubois and Philippe signed an accord with England and the
United Prov- inces (“Holland”) on January 4, 1717. This was a boon to
France, to</p>
<p>the European balance of power, and to Britain; for if France and
Spain had come under one head their combined fleets would have
challenged Eng- land’s control of the seas. It was also a boon to the
new and insecure Hanoverian monarchy in England, since France was now
pledged to give no further aid to the Stuart claimants to the English
crown.</p>
<p>The Spanish government was outwitted, and was not pleased. Its ruling
minister, Alberoni, joined in the plot of Cellamare and the Duchesse du
Maine to overthrow the Regent and make Philip V king of France. Dubois
unearthed the conspiracy, and persuaded the reluctant Philippe to follow
England in declaring war against Spain (1718). The Treaty of The Hague
(1720) ended this conflict. To consolidate the peace, Dubois arranged
the mating of Philip’s daughter to Louis XV, and of Philippe’s daughters
to Philip’s sons. The marriages were contracted on the frontier island
of Bidassoa (January 9, 1722), and were celebrated with an auto-da-fe.
90 As the Infanta Maria Ana Victoria was only three years old, it would
be some time before Louis XV could elicit from her an heir to the
throne; if in this interim the young King should die, the Regent would
become king of France, and Dubois would be his perpetual minister.</p>
<p>He climbed subtly step by step. In 1720 he was made archbishop of</p>
<p>Cambrai; by the humor of history a Protestant king, George I, asked
the skeptical Regent to persuade the Pope to give Dubois this famous
archie- piscopal see, recently ennobled by Fenelon; and the bishops of
France, in- cluding the saintly Massillon, joined in the ceremonies
conferring this dignity upon a man whom many Frenchmen considered an
epitome of sin. Dubois felt himself inadequately rewarded for his
services to France. He used French money to promote to the papacy a
candidate pledged to send him a red hat. Innocent XIII sadly kept the
promise, and the Archbishop became Cardinal Dubois (July 16, 1721). A
year later he was made prin- cipal minister of the realm, with a salary
of 1 00,000 livres. As he had an in- come of 120,000 livres from his
archbishopric, and 204,000 from seven abbeys, and 100,000 as
superintendent of the post, and an English pension reckoned by
Saint-Simon at 960,000, Dubois now had an annual income of some
1,500,000 livres. 91 His only worry was that his wife, who was still
alive, might refuse his bribes, reveal her existence, and invalidate his
ec- clesiastical dignities. 92</p>
<p>Time caught up with him. On February 5, 1723, Louis XV came of age,
and the Regency ended. Still only thirteen, the King, enjoying life at
Ver- sailles, asked Philippe to continue to govern the kingdom, and
Dubois re-</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>mained Philippe’s principal aide. But on August i the Cardinal’s
bladder burst, and suddenly, loaded with livres, he was dead. Philippe
took over the administration, but with him too time had run out.
Surfeited with women, stupefied with drink, losing his sight, losing
even his good manners, he bore in semiconsciousness the contumely of a
regime that had begun with almost universal good will and was ending in
official abasement and public con- tempt. The doctors warned him that
his mode of life was killing him. He did not care. He had drunk the wine
of life too greedily, and had reached the dregs. He died of an
apoplectic fit, December 2, 1723, falling into the arms of his mistress
pro tern. He was forty-nine years old.</p>
<p>Philippe d’Orleans does not impress us as a bad man, despite the
gamut of his sins. He had the vices of the flesh rather than of the
soul: he was a spendthrift, a drunkard, and a lecher, but he was not
selfish, cruel, or mean. He was a man of mercy, brave and kind. He won a
kingdom by a gamble, and gave it away with light heart and open hand.
His wealth provided him with every opportunity, his power offered him no
discipline. It is a pitiful sight — a man brilliant in mind, liberal in
views, struggling to repair the damage done to France by the bigotry of
the Great King, letting noble purposes drown in meaningless
intoxication, and losing love in a maelstrom of debauchery.</p>
<p>Morally, the Regency was the most shameful period in the history of
France. Religion, beneficent in the villages, disgraced itself at the
top by anointing men like Dubois and Tencin with high honors, so losing
the respect of the emancipated intellect. The French mind enjoyed
comparative freedom, but used it not to spread a humane and tolerant
intelligence so much as to loose human instincts from the social control
necessary to civili- zation; skepticism forgot Epicurus, and became
epicurean. Government was corrupt, but it preserved peace long enough to
let France recover from a devastating reign of grandeur and war. The
“System” of Law collapsed in bankruptcy, but it gave a powerful stimulus
to the French economy. Those eight years saw the spread of free
education, and the liberation of art and literature from royal tutelage
and domination; they were the years of The Embarkation for Cythera, of
Gil Bias, of Oedipe, of Montesquieu’s Lettres persanes. The Regency sent
Voltaire to the Bastille, but it gave him such freedom and toleration as
he would never know again in France even in the hour of his triumph and
his death.</p>

<li>VOLTAIRE AND THE BASTILLE: 1715-26</li>
</ol>
<p>A characteristic passage in Saint-Simon describes a young upstart who
made much noise during the Regency:</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Arouet, son of a notary who was employed by my father and me</p>
<p>until his death, was exiled … to Tulle at this time 〔1716〕 for some
verses very satirical and very impudent. I should not amuse myself by
writing down such a trifle if this same Arouet, having become a great
poet and academician under the name of Voltaire, had not also become …
a</p>
<p>manner of personage in the republic of letters, and even achieved a
sort of importance among certain people. 93</p>
<p>This young upstart, now twenty-one, described himself as “thin, long,
and fleshless, without buttocks.” 94 Perhaps because of this disability,
he pranced from one host or hostess to another, welcomed even in lordly
circles for his sparkling verse and ready wit, imbibing and effusing
heresy, and playing the gallant. Shining especially at Sceaux, he
pleased the Duchesse du Maine by satirizing the Regent. When Philippe
reduced by a half the horses in the royal stables, Arouet quipped that
he would have done better to dismiss half the asses that cro wded his
Highness’s court. Worse yet, he seems to have set afloat some lines on
the morals of the Duchesse de Berry. Voltaire denied authorship, but
those lines were later published in his Works. He kept up this strategy
of denial almost to the end of his life, as a forgivable protection
against a threatening censorship. The Regent could pardon lampoons of
himself, for they were often undeserved; but he was deeply hurt by
squibs on his daughter, for they were mostly true. On May 5, 1716, he
issued an order that “the Sieur Arouet, the son, be sent to Tulle” — a
town three hundred miles south of Paris, famed for its odorous
tanneries, not yet for the delicate fabric that later took its name.
Arouet’s father persuaded the Regent to change the place of exile from
Tulle to Sully-sur-Loire, a hundred miles from the capital. Arouet went,
and was received as a house guest by the current Due de Sully,
descendant of Henry IV’s great minister.</p>
<p>He enjoyed there everything but liberty. Soon he addressed a
verse</p>
<p>“Epitre a M. le due d’Orleans,” protesting his innocence, and begging
re - lease. It was granted; and by the end of the year he was back in
Paris, flut- tering and rhyming, sometimes obscenely, often
superficially, always clev- erly. Consequently any able satire running
anonymously along cafe tables was ascribed to him. Early in 1717 an
especially pointed diatribe appeared, in which each sentence began with
J’ai vu — “I have seen.” For example:</p>
<p>/ have seen the Bastille and a thousand other prisons filled with
brave citizens, faithful subjects.</p>
<p>I have seen the people wretched under a rigorous servitude.</p>
<p>I have seen the soldiery perishing of hunger, thirst . . . and
rage.</p>
<p>I have seen a devil in the guise of a woman . . . ruling the kingdom.
. . .</p>
<p>7 have seen Port-Royal demolished. …</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>/ have seen — and this includes all — a Jesuit adored</p>
<p>1 have seen these evils, and I am not yet twenty years old. 95</p>
<p>Obviously these verses referred to Louis XIV and Mme. de Maintenon,
and they must have been written by a Jansenist foe of the Jesuits,
rather than by an impious skeptic who still had a kindly beat in his
heart for the Society of Jesus. The real author w as A. L. Le Bran, who
later begged Voltaire’s forgiveness for having let him bear the blame.
98 But gossip lauded Arouet for the poem; literary gatherings importuned
him to recite it, and no one (except the author) believed his denials.
Reports to the Regent accused him not only of the yai-vus but also — and
apparently with justice — of a Latin in- scription, “Puero regnante . .
.”— “A boy 〔Louis XV〕 reigning; a man no - torious for poisoning and
incest ruling; . . . public faith violated 〔failure of La w’s bank〕 ;
. . . the country sacrificed to the hope of a crown; an in - heritance
basely anticipated; France about to perish.” 97 On May 16, 1717, a
lettre de cachet directed “that Sieur Arouet be arrested and taken to
the Bastille.” The poet was surprised in his rooms, and was allowed to
take with him nothing but the clothes he wore.</p>
<p>He had no time to bid adieu to his current mistress, Suzanne de
Livry; his friend Lefevre de Genonville took his place on her bosom;
Arouet par- doned them philosophically — “We must put up with these
bagatelles.” 98 A few years later Lefevre died, and Voltaire wrote to
his memory verses that may exemplify the young rebel’s talent for
gracious poetry, and the tender</p>

<p>3*</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Suzanne married the wealthy Marquis de Gouvemet, and refused to admit
Voltaire when he called at her home. He consoled himself with the
thought that “all the diamonds and pearls that deck her now are not
worth one of her kisses in the old days.” 100 He did not see her again
until, fifty -one years later, he came back to Paris to die; then, aged
eighty-three, he made it a point to visit the widowed Marquise, aged
eighty-four. There was a devil in this Voltaire, but also the kindest
heart in the world.</p>
<p>He did not find the Bastille intolerable. He was allowed to send —
and pay — for books, furniture, linen, a nightcap, and perfume; he often
dined with the governor, played billiards and bowling with prisoners and
guards; and he wrote La Henriade. The Iliad was among the books he had
sent for; why should he not rival Homer? And why limit epics to legends?
There, in living history, was Henry IV, gay, bold, heroic, lecherous,
tol- erant, generous; why could not that adventurous, tragic life be fit
for epic poetry? The prisoner was not allowed writing paper, for this in
his hands could be a deadly weapon; so he wrote the first half of his
epic between the lines of printed books.</p>
<p>He was released on April n, 1718, but was forbidden to stay in Paris.
From Chatenay, near Sceaux, he wrote letters to the Regent, begging for-
giveness; again the Regent relented, and on October 1 2 issued
permission to “le Sieur Arouet de Voltaire to come to Paris whenever he
pleases.” 101</p>
<p>But when and how had he come to that new name? Apparently about the
time of this imprisonment in the Bastille. We find it first in the edict
just cited. Some 102 have thought it an anagram for AROUET L 〔e〕 J
〔eune〕 , tak- ing U as V and J as I. The Marquise de Crequi 103
ascribed it to Veautaire, a small farm near Paris; Voltaire had
inherited this from a cousin; it conveyed no seigneurial rights, but
Arouet, like Balzac, took the seigneurial de by right of genius, and
signed himself, as in the dedication to his first play, “Arouet de
Voltaire.” Soon he would need only one name to identify himself any -
where in Europe.</p>
<p>That play, Oedipe, was an event in the literary history of France. It
was stark insolence in a lad of twenty-four to challenge not only
Corneille, who had staged his Oedipe in 1659, but Sophocles too, whose
Oedipus Tyrannus had appeared 330 b.c. Moreover, this was a tale of
incest, and might be taken as reflecting upon the relations of the
Regent with his daughter — precisely the issue on which Arouet had been
imprisoned. The Duchesse du Maine, at whose court the poet had conceived
his play, interpreted it so, and rejoiced. With his usual audacity,
Voltaire asked the Regent might he dedicate the piece to him; the Regent
demurred, but permitted dedication to his mother. The premiere was
announced for November 18, 1718. Two factions formed among the playgoers
of Paris — those supporting the Re- gent, and those favoring the
Duchesse du Maine; it was expected that their</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>duel of hisses and cheers would make a farce of the performance. But
the clever author had inserted lines to please one faction, other lines
to please the other. The Regent’s party was appeased by a passage
describing how King Laius (like Philippe) dismissed the costly palace
guard; the Jesuits were gratified to see how well their pupil had
profited from the dramas they had staged at the College Louis-le-Grand;
but the freethinkers hailed enthusiastically two lines, in the first
scene of Act IV, that were to become the theme song of Voltaire’s
life:</p>
<p>Nos pretres ne sont pas ce qu’un vain peuple pense ;</p>
<p>Notre credulite fait toute leur science</p>
<p>—“Our priests are not what a silly populace supposes; all their
learning c onsists in our credulity.” Each faction applauded in turn,
and in the end the drama was greeted with unanimous approval. According
to an old tradi- tion Voltaire’s father, approaching death, came to the
first night still breath - ing anger against his worthless and
disreputable son, but wept with pride at the splendor of the poetry and
the triumph of the play.</p>
<p>Oedipe had an unprecedented run of forty- five days. Even Corneille’s
nephew, the aging Fontenelle, praised it, though he suggested to
Voltaire that some of the verses were “too strong and full of fire.” The
brash youth replied with an ungracious double- entendre : “To correct
myself I shall read your Pastorales.” 10 * Paris insisted on identifying
the incestuous Oedi - pus with the Regent, and Jocasta with his
daughter. Facing the gossip bravely, the Duchesse de Berry attended
several performances. The Regent had the play produced at his palace
theater, and welcomed the author to his court.</p>
<p>A few months later a scandalmongering poet, hiding under anonymity,
issued Les Philippiques, diatribes in which Philippe was accused of
planning to poison the young King and usurp the throne. Voltaire was
widely sus- pected of authorship; he protested his innocence, but he had
lied so fla- grantly in similar cases that now only the author believed
him. Philippe gave him the benefit of the doubt, and merely advised him
to absent himself from Parisian felicity a while. He went back to the
Chateau de Sully (May,</p>
<p>1719). After a year he was allowed to return to the capital. There he
was for a time a darling of the aristocracy.</p>
<p>Convinced that money was the philosopher’s stone, he put his sharp
wits to the problems and tricks of finance. He cultivated bankers, and
was well rewarded for helping the brothers Paris to secure contracts to
supply provi- sions and munitions to the army; 105 our hero was a war
profiteer. He stayed out of Law’s System, invested judiciously, lent
money at interest. In 1722 his father died, and after some resolute
litigation Voltaire inherited an annuity of 4,250 francs. In that same
year he received from the Regent a</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>pension of 2,000 livres. He was now a rich man; soon he would be a
mil- lionaire. We must not think of him as a revolutionist, except in
religion.</p>
<p>Fortunately for his education, his second drama, Artemire, failed
(Feb- ruary 15, 1720). He ran from his box onto the stage, and argued
with the audience on the merits of the piece; they applauded his speech
but kept their thumbs down; after eight performances he withdrew the
play. Later in that year he read part of La Henriade at a gathering;
there were some criticisms; in a Virgilian gesture he threw the
manuscript into the fire; H6nault snatched the sheets from the flame,
and compared himself to Augustus rescuing the Aeneid; Voltaire, he said,
now owed him an epic and “a nice pair of sleeve ruffles.” 106 The poet
easily recovered his pride when the Regent himself listened to a reading
from the poem. Wherever he went he read some part of it. In 1723 he
visited Lord Bolingbroke and his French wife at their villa, La Source,
near Orleans; they assured him that his epic surpassed “all poetical
works which have appeared in France.” 107 He pretended to doubt it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he exchanged philosophies with the titled skeptic, and
heard of the deists who were bedeviling Christianity in Britain. He
began to sus- pect that England had advanced beyond France in science
and philosophy. But he had come to Bolingbroke’s heresies before meeting
him or reading the English deists. In 1722 he accepted the invitation of
the Comtesse Marie de Rupelmonde to accompany her to the Netherlands.
She was a widow, aged thirty-eight, and intellectual, but she was
beautiful. He, aged twenty- eight, accepted. At Brussels he met a rival
poet, Jean Baptiste Rousseau, who praised Oedipe but chided Voltaire for
impiety. Seldom able to bear criticism patiently, Voltaire remarked
about Rousseau’s “Ode to Posterity,” “Do you know, my master, that I do
not believe this ode will ever reach its address?” 108 They continued to
snap at each other till Rousseau’s death. As Voltaire and his Countess
continued on their way to Holland, she re- vealed her religious doubts
to him, and asked him for his own views. Bub- bling with verse, he
replied in a famous Epitre d Uranie, which was not published till 1732,
and not acknowledged by Voltaire till forty years after- ward. Every
sensitive Christian youth will recognize in it a stage in his own
development.</p>
<p>Tu veux done, belle Uranie,</p>

<p>Devant toi, d’une main bar die,</p>
<p>Aux superstitions farrache le bandeau;</p>

<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>T’apprenne a mepriser les horreurs du tombeau,</p>
<p>Et les terreurs de P autre vie *</p>
<p>The poet proceeds with “respectful step.” “I wish to love God, I seek
in him my father”; but what kind of God does the Christian theology
offer? “A tyrant whom we should hate. He created men in ‘his own image,’
only to make them vile; he gave us sinful hearts to have the right to
punish us; he made us love pleasure, so that he might torment us with
frightful pains . . . eternal.” He had hardly given us birth when he tho
ught of destroying us. He ordered the water to engulf the earth. He sent
his son to atone for our sins; Christ died, but apparently in vain, for
we are told that we are still stained with the crime of Adam and Eve;
and the Son of God, so acclaimed for mercy, is represented as waiting
vengefully to plunge most of us into hell, including all those countless
people who never heard of him. “I do not recognize in this disgraceful
picture the God whom I must</p>
<p>adore - 1 should dishonor him by such insult and homage.” And yet he
feels the nobility and the living inspiration in the Christian concept
of the Saviour:</p>
<p>Behold this Christ, powerful and glorious, . . . trampling death
under his triumphant feet, and emerging victorious from the gates of
hell.</p>
<p>His example is holy, his morality is divine. He consoles in secret
the</p>
<p>hearts that he illumines; in the greatest misfortunes he gives them
sup- port; and if he bases his doctrine on an illusion, it is still a
blessing to be deceived with him.</p>
<p>In conclusion the poet invites Uranie to make up her own mind on
religion, in full trust that God, who “has placed natural religion in
your heart, will not resent a simple and candid spirit. Believe that
before his throne, in all times, in all places, the soul of the just man
is precious; believe that the modest Buddhist monk, the kindly Moslem
dervish, find more grace in his eyes than a pitiless 〔predestinarian〕
Jansenist or an ambitious pope.”</p>
<p>Back in Paris Voltaire settled down in the Hotel de Bemieres on
the</p>
<p>Rue de Beaune and the present Quai Voltaire (1723). In November he
went to a gathering of notables in the Chateau de Maisons (nine miles
from Paris), where the greatest actress of the age, Adrienne Lecouvreur,
was to read his new play, Mariamne. But before that ceremony could take
place he came down with smallpox, which in those days killed a high
percentage of its hosts. He made his will, confessed, and awaited death.
The other guests * “You wish, then, lovely Urania 〔a name for
Aphrodite〕, th at, raised at your command into a new Lucretius, I
should before you, with bold hand, tear the veil from superstitions;
that I should expose to your eyes the dangerous tableau of holy lies
with which the earth is filled, and that my philosophy should teach you
to despise the horrors of the tomb and the terrors of the other
life”</p>

<p>fled, but the Marquis de Maisons called in Dr. Gervais from Paris.
“Instead</p>
<p>In 1724 La Henriade began secretly to circulate among the
intelligentsia. It was a political broadcast on an epic scale. Taking
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew as a text, it traced religious crimes
through the ages: mothers offering their children to be burned on the
altars of Aloloch; Agamemnon preparing to sacrifice his daughter to the
gods for a little breeze; Christians persecuted by Romans , heretics by
Christians, fanatics “invoking the Lord while slaughtering their
brothers”; devotees inspired to kill French kings. The poem lauded
Elizabeth for helping Henry of Navarre. It described the battle of Ivry,
the clemency of Henry, his liaison with Gabrielle</p>
<p>d’Estrees, his siege of Paris. It approved his conversion to
Catholicism, but it criticized the papacy as a power “inflexible to the
conquered, complaisant to conquerors, ready, as in terest dictates,
either to absolve or to condemn.”</p>
<p>Voltaire had hoped that La Henriade would be accepted as the national
epic of France, but Catholicism was too dear to his countrymen to let
them receive the poem as the epos of their soul. And its faults leaped
to the scholarly eye. The obvious imitations of Homer and Virgil — in
the battle scenes, in the visit of the hero to hell, in the intrusion of
personified ab- stractions, after the manner of Homeric deities, into
the action — sacrificed the charms of invention and originality; and
though the style made good prose, it lacked the illuminating imagery of
verse. The author, drunk with printer’s ink, had no suspicion of this.
He wrote to Thieriot: “Epic poetry is my forte, or I am much deceived.”
110 He was much deceived.</p>
<p>Even so, the plaudits seemed to justify him. A French critic
pronounced it superior to the Aeneid, and Frederick the Great thought
that “a man without prejudice will prefer La Henriade to the poem of
Homer.” 111 The first edition was soon disposed of; a pirated edition
was published in Hol- land and exported into France; the police banned
the book; everyone bought it. It was translated into seven languages; we
shall see it making a stir in England. It played a part in reviving the
popularity of Henry IV. It made France ashamed of its religious wars,
and critical of the theologies that had inflamed men to such
ferocity.</p>
<p>Now for a time Voltaire enjoyed fame and fortune unalloyed. He was
recognized as the greatest living poet in France. He was received at the
court of Louis XV; the Queen wept over his plays, and gave him 1,500
livres from her privy purse (1725). He wrote a dozen letters complaining
and boasting of his life as a courtier. He talked in a tone of easy
familiarity</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>FRANCE: THE REGENCY</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>with lords, noble or ignoble. Doubtless he talked too much, which is
the easiest thing in the world. One night at the opera (December, 1725)
the Chevalier de Rohan-Chabot, hearing him hold forth in the lobby,
asked him, with a very superior air, u Monsieur de Voltaire, Monsieur
Arouet — comment vous appelez- vous? 〔what really is your name?〕” We
do not know what the poet replied. Two days later they met at the
Comedie- Fra^aise; Rohan repeated his question. Voltaire’s rejoinder is
diversely re - ported; in one account he answered, “One who does not
trail after a great</p>
<p>On February 4 Voltaire was lunching at the house of the Due de Sully
when a message came that someone wished to see him at the palace gate.
He went. Six ruffians pounced upon him and beat him mercifully. Rohan,
di- recting the operation from his carriag e, cautioned them, “Don’t
strike his head; something good may come out of that.” 114 Voltaire
rushed back to the house, and asked Sully ’s aid in taking legal action
against Rohan; Sully refused. The poet retired to a suburb, where he
practiced swordsmanship. Then he appeared at Versailles, resolved to
demand “satisfaction” from the Chevalier. The law made dueling a capital
crime. A royal order bade the police watch him. Rohan refused to meet
him. That night, to the relief of everyone concerned, the police
arrested the poet, and he found himself again in the Bastille. “The
family of the prisoner,” reported the lieutenant general of the Paris
police, “applauded unanimously . . . the wisdom of an order which kept
the young man from committing some ne w folly.” 115 Voltaire wrote to
the authorities defending his conduct, and offering to go in voluntary
exile to England if released. He was treated as before, with every
comfort and consideration.</p>
<p>His proposal was accepted; after fifteen days he was freed, but a
guard was ordered to see him to Calais. Members of the government gave
him letters of introduction and recommendation to prominent Englishmen,
and the Queen continued to pay his pension. At Calais he was entertained
by friends while waiting for the next boat to sail. On May 10 he
embarked, armed with books for the study of English, and not unwilling
to see the country in which, he had heard, men and minds were free. Let
us see.</p>
