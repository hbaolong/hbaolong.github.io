<p>Leibniz</p>
<p>1646 — 1716</p>
<p>I. THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW</p>
<p>A CHASM of character and thought separates Spinoza from Leibniz.</p>
<p>The solitary Jew, cast out by Judaism, not accepting
Christianity,</p>
<p>living in poverty in an attic room, finishing only two books, slowly
evolv- ing a boldly original philosophy that would alienate all the
religions, and dying of consumption at forty-four; the German man of the
world, busy with statesmen and courts, traveling through nearly all of
Western Europe, spreading his feelers into Russia and China, accepting
both Protestantism and Catholicism, welcoming and using a dozen systems
of thought, writing half a hundred treatises, embracing God and the
world with desperate optimism, living out his threescore years and ten,
and resembling his prede- cessor only in the loneliness of his funeral:
here in one generation are the antipodes of modem philosophy.</p>
<p>But before we come to this protean mosaic of a man, let us
acknowledge some minor credits to German thought. Samuel von Pufendorf
began his trajectory in 1632, in the same year as Spinoza and Locke.
After studying at Leipzig and Jena he went to Copenhagen as tutor in the
family of a Swedish diplomat; was arrested with him when Sweden declared
war upon Denmark; and tempered the tedium of imprisonment by
constructing a sys- tem of international law. Released, he moved to
Leiden, where he published the results as Elementa Jurisprudentiae
universalis (1661), which so pleased Charles Louis of the Palatinate
(the same who later invited Spinoza) that the Elector called him to
Heidelberg, and created for him a professor- ship in natural and
international law — the first such chair in history. There Pufendorf
composed a study of the German realm, De Statu Imperii Ger- manici,
Liber Unus (1667), which shocked Leopold I by attacking the Holy Roman
Empire and its emperors. Pufendorf migrated to Sweden and the University
of Lund (1670), where he published his chef d’ oeuvre, De lure Naturae
et Gentium (1672). Attempting to mediate between Hobbes and Grotius,
Pufendorf identified the “law of nature” not with the “war of each
against all,” but with the dictates of “right reason.” He extended
“natural rights” (rights belonging to all rational beings) to Jews
and</p>
<p>Turks, and argued that international law should hold not only among
Ghris-</p>
<p>658</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>659</p>
<p>tian states, but equally in their relations with “infidels.” He
preceded Jean Jacques Rousseau by almost a century in declaring that the
will of the state is, and should be, the sum of the wills of its
constituent individuals; but he thought slavery desirable as a way of
reducing the number of beggars, tramps and thieves. 1</p>
<p>Some Swedish pastors thought these theories made too little account
of God and the Bible in political philosophy; they urged that Pufendorf
be returned to Germany; but Charles XI called him to Stockholm and made
him historiographer royal. The professor repaid him by writing a
biography of the King and a history of Sweden. In 1687, perhaps with an
eye to travel, Pufendorf dedicated to the Great Elector of Brandenburg a
treatise on the relation of the Christian religion to civil life (De
Habitu cbristianae Religionis ad Vitam civilem), defending toleration.
He soon accepted a call to Berlin, became historiographer to Frederick
William, was made a baron, and died (1694). His writings remained for
half a century the dominant works in political and legal philosophy in
Protestant Europe, and their realistic analysis of social relations
helped events to deflate the theory of the divine right of kings.</p>
<p>The decline in the theological interpretation of human affairs was
accen- tuated by the careers of Balthasar Bekker and Christian
Thomasius. Bekker was a Dutch pastor ministering to a flock in
Friesland. Having spoiled his faith with Descartes, he proposed to apply
reason to Scripture. He inter- preted Biblical devils as popular
delusions or metaphors; he traced the pre-Christian history of the idea
of Satan, held it an interpolation into Christianity, concluded that the
Devil was a myth, and blasted him out of existence in a Dutch manifesto,
De betooverte Wereld ( The Bedeviled World, 1691). The Church severely
censured Bekker, feeling that fear of the Devil is the beginning of
wisdom. The Devil suffered some loss in prestige, but not in
devotees.</p>
<p>Thomasius carried on the battle. While continuing to accept the
Scrip- tures as a guide to religion and salvation, he aspired to follow
the rule of reason, to believe only up to the evidence, and to encourage
religious toler- ation. As professor of natural law at Leipzig
(1684-90), he offended the faculty and the ministry by the originality
of his views, methods, and language. He countered the superstitions of
his time with lusty German laughter; he agreed with Bekker in exorcizing
the Devil from religion; he denounced the belief in witchcraft as
shameful ignorance, and the persecu- tion of “witches” as criminal bru
tality; through his influence trials for sorcery were ended in Germany.
To make matters worse, he lectured his students in German instead of
Latin, taking half the dignity out of peda- gogy. In 1688 he began to
pubish a periodical review of books and ideas; we should have called it
the first serious journal in German, but it took</p>
<p>66o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>its erudition with a light heart, coated scholarship with humor, and
called itself Scherzhafte und emsthafte, vernunftige und einfdltige
Gedanken iiber allerhand lustige und nutzliche Bucher und Fragen (
Jocose and Earnest, Rational and Silly Thoughts on All Kinds of Pleasant
and Useful Books and Questions). His defense of the Pietists against the
orthodox clergy, and of intermarriage between Lutherans and Calvinists,
so alarmed the authorities that they forbade him to write or lecture,
and finally ordered his arrest (1690). He escaped to Berlin; the Elector
Frederick III gave him a professorship at Halle; he took part in
organizing the university there, and soon made it the liveliest
intellectual center in Germany. In 1709 Leipzig invited him to return;
he refused, and remained at Halle thirty-four years, to the end of his
life. He inaugurated the Aufklarung which produced Less- ing and
Frederick the Great.</p>
<p>Some of the enthusiasts pushed their revolt to the extremes of
atheism. Matthias Knutzen of Holstein discarded all supernatural belief;
“insuper Deum negamus” — above all we deny God. 2 He proposed to replace
Chris- tianity, its churches, and its priests with a positivist
“religion of humanity” in full anticipation of Auguste Comte, and to
base morality solely on the naturalistic education of conscience (1674).
He claimed seven hundred followers; this was probably an exaggeration;
but we observe that between 1662 and 1713 at least twenty-two works were
published in Germany aiming to spread or refute atheism. 3</p>
<p>Leibniz deplored “the apparent triumph of freethinkers.” “In our
day,” he wrote, toward 1700, “many people have scant respect for
Revelation . . . or miracles.” 4 And he added, in 1715: “Natural
religion is growing very much weaker. Many hold that souls are
corporeal; others that God Himself is corporeal. Mr. Locke and his
followers are doubtful whether souls are not material and naturally
perishable.” 5 Leibniz was not too firm in his own faith; but as a man
of the world and its courts, he wondered where the rising rationalism
would end, and what it would do to churches, morals, and thrones. Could
the rationalists be answered in their own terms, and the faith of the
fathers be rescued for the health of the children?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WANDERJAHRE</li>
</ol>
<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was two years old when the Thirty
Years’</p>
<p>War ended; he grew up in one of the most barren and unhappy periods
of German history. But he had every educational opportunity then
available, for his father was professor of moral philosophy at the
University of Leipzig. Gottfried was a Wunderkind, eager for knowledge
and in love with books. The paternal library was opened to him with the
invitation</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>“ Tolle , lege” (Take and read). He began Latin at eight, Greek at
twelve; he devoured history; he became a “polymath” — learned in many
fields. At fifteen he entered the university, where the stimulating
Thomasius was one of his teachers. At twenty he applied for the doctor’s
degree in law; Leipzig refused it because of his youth, but he received
it soon afterward from Nuremberg’s university at Altdorf. His doctoral
dissertation there made such an impression that he was at once offered a
professorship. He declined, saying that he had “different things in
view.” Very few of the major</p>
<p>philosophers have held university chairs.</p>
<p>Economically secure, intellectually free, he now dipped into all
the</p>
<p>movements and philosophies that were agitating renascent Germany. He
had studied the Scholastic systems at Leipzig; he kept their terminology
and many of their ideas, like the ontological proof for the existence of
God. He imbibed the full Cartesian tradition, but salted it with
Gassendi’s ob - jections and atomism. He passed on to Hobbes, praised
him as subtilissimus, and flirted with materialism. 6 Living for a time
(1666-67) * n Nuremberg, he sampled the mysticism of the Rosicrucians
(Fraternitas Rosae Crucis), that Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross which
alchemists, physicians, and clergymen had founded about 1 654; he became
its secretary and delved into alchemy, very much as his future rival
Newton was doing at Cambridge. He left no idea untouched or unborrowed.
Before he was twenty-two he had written several treatises, small in
scope but swelling with confidence.</p>
<p>One of these, Novus Methodus docendi discendique luris (A New</p>
<p>Method of Teaching and Learning Law) attracted the attention of a</p>
<p>diplomat then staying in Nuremberg, Johann von Boineburg, who advised
the young author to dedicate it to the Archbishop Elector of Mainz, and
arranged to have it presented in person. The plan worked, and in 1667
Leibniz entered the service of the Elector, first as assistant in
revising the laws, then as councilor. He remained at Mainz five years.
He became familiar with Catholic clergymen, theology, and ritual, and
began to dream of reuniting the sundered Christian creeds. The Elector,
however, was more interested in Louis XIV than in Luther, for the
insatiable King was spread- ing his armies into the Low Countries and
Lorraine, too close to Germany, and was obviously anxious to swallow the
Rhine. How could he be stopped?</p>
<p>Leibniz had a plan for that — indeed, two plans, brilliant enough for
a lad of twenty-four. The first was to unite the western German states
in a Rheinbund for mutual defense (1670). The second was to deflect
Louis from Germany by persuading him to seize Egypt from the Turks.
Rela- tions between France and Turkey were at that time strained; if
Louis (anticipating Napoleon by 128 years) were to send an expedition to
con- quer Egypt, he would capture control of the commerce — including
Dutch commerce — that went from Europe through Egypt to the East, he
would</p>
<p>662</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>keep the soil of France free of war, he would end the Ottoman threat
to Christendom, he would be the honored savior, instead of the dreaded
scourge, of Europe. Boineburg so wrote to Louis, enclosing an outline of
the plan from Leinbniz’ pen.* Simon Arnaud de Pomponne, the French
foreign minister, invited Leibniz (February, 1672) to come and offer the
plan to the King. In March the twenty-six-year-old statesman set out for
Paris.</p>
<p>The generals foiled him and themselves. By the time Leibniz reached
Paris Louis had mended his quarrel with Turkey, and had decided to
attack Holland; on April 6 he declared war. Pomponne informed Leibniz
that crusades were out of fashion, and he refused to let him see the
King. Still hoping, the philosopher drew up for the French government a
memorial, of which he sent a summary — the Consilium Aegyptiacum — to
Boineburg. If the proposal had been carried out to success, France,
rather than England, might have captured India and the rule of the seas.
Louis’ decision, said Admiral Mahan, “which killed Colbert and ruined
the prosperity of France,</p>
<p>Boineburg died before the Consilium reached him, and Leibniz mourned
the loss of an unselfish friend. Partly for this reason he did not
return to Mainz; moreover, he had been caught in the intellectual
currents of Paris, and found them more stimulating than those that
surrounded even the liberal and enlightened Elector. Now he met Antoine
Arnauld of Port- Royal, and Malebranche, and Christian Huygens, and
Bossuet. Huygens drew him into higher mathematics, and Leibniz began
those infinitesimal calculations that were to lead him to the
calculus.</p>
<p>In January, 1673, on a mission from the Elector of Mainz to Charles
II, he crossed the Channel to England. In London he made the
acquaintance of Oldenburg and Boyle, and felt the zest of awakening
science. Returning to Paris in March, he gave more and more of his time
to mathematics. He contrived a computing machi ne that improved upon
Pascal’s by performing multiplication and division as well as addition
and subtraction. In April he was elected, in absence, a member of the
Royal Society. By 1675 he had discovered the differential calculus, by
1676 the infinitesimal calculus, and he had formulated his successful
notation. No one any longer charges Leibniz with having plagiarized his
calculus from Newton’s. 9 Newton had apparently made his discovery in
1666, but he did not publish it till 1692; Leibniz published his
differential calculus in 1684, his integral calculus in</p>

<p>•“Even this early,” said Spengler, “Leibniz laid down the principle
that Napoleon grasped . . . more clearly after Wagram, viz., that
acquisitions on the Rhine and in Belgium would not permanently better
the position of France, and that the neck of Suez would one day be the
key of world- dominance .” 7</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>663</p>
<p>Leibniz reached his own discovery independently, that he antedated
Newton in publishing the discovery, and that Leibniz’ system of notation
proved superior to Newton’s. 11</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Mainz died in March, 1673, leaving Leibniz without
official employment. Soon he signed an agreement to serve Duke John
Frederick of Brunswick-Liineburg as curator of the ducal library at Han-
over. Still fascinated by Paris, Leibniz remained there till 1676,
then</p>
<p>traveled leisurely to Hanover via London, Amsterdam, and The Hague.
At Amsterdam he talked with Spinoza’s disciples, and at The Hague with
the philosopher himself. Spinoza hesitated to confide in him, for
Leibniz was proposing to reconcile Catholicism and Protestantism, which
might then join in suppressing freedom of thought. 12 Leibniz overcame
these suspicions, and Spinoza allowed him to read — even to copy
passages from — the manuscript Ethical The two men had several long
conversations. Leibniz had much trouble, after Spinoza’s death, in
concealing how deeply he had been influenced by the saintly Jew.</p>
<p>He reached Hanover toward the end of 1676, and remained in the employ
of successive Brunswick princes through the remaining forty years of his
life. He had hoped to be accepted as a councilor of state, but the dukes
assigned him to care for their libraries and write the history of their
house. He performed these tasks intermittently well. His voluminous
history (Annales Brunsvicenses) was weighted and illuminated with
original documents assiduously obtained; his genealogical researches in
Italy estab- lished the common origin of the Este and Brunswick
dynasties; and though the subject of his book was uncomfortably
confining for so ambitious a genius, he lived to see the Brunswick
family inherit England. He tried hard to be a German patriot; he pleaded
with the Germans to use their vernacular in law; but he wrote his
treatises in Latin or French, and was a shi ning exemplar of the “good
European” and the cosmopolitan mind. He warned the German princes that
their divisive jealousies, and their deliberate weakening of the
Imperial power, condemned Germany to be the victim of better centralized
states, and the battleground of repeated wars between France, England,
and Spain. 14</p>
<p>His secret hope was to serve the Emperor and the Empire rather than
the princes of the separate states. He had a hundred plans for
political, economic, religious, and educational reform, and he agreed
with Voltaire that it was easier to reform a state by converting its
ruler than by slowly educating the masses, who are too harassed with
board and bed to have much time for thought. 16 In 1680, when the
Imperial librarian died, Leibniz offered himself for the post, but he
added that he would not want it unless it carried with it membership in
the Emperor’s Privy Council. His application was rejected. Returning to
Hanover, he found some solace in</p>
<p>664</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>the friendship of the Electress Sophia, and, later, of her daughter
Sophia Charlotte, who gave him entree to the Prussian court, helped him
to found the Berlin Academy (1700), and inspired him to write his
TheodicSe. For the rest he ennobled his modest position by corresponding
with the leading thinkers of Europe, by making major contributions to
philosophy, and by advancing a brave plan for the religious
reunification of Christendom.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>LEIBNIZ AND CHRISTIANITY</li>
</ol>
<p>Was he himself a Christian? Outwardly yes, of course; a man with his
zeal to pass from philosophy to statesmanship had to robe himself in the
theology of his time and place. “I have endeavoured in all things,” said
his pr eface to the Theodicy “to consider the need for edification.” 16
The writings that he published during his life were exemplary in their
faith; they defended the Trinity, miracles, divine grace, free will,
immortality; and they attacked the freethinkers of the age as
undermining the moral bases of social order. However, “he went to church
little . . . and for many years did not communicate”; 17 the simple
people of Hanover nicknamed him Lovenix (i.e., glauht nichts — believes
nothing). 18 Some students have credited him with two opposed
philosophies: one for public consumption and the comforting of
princesses; the other “a clear -cut affirmation of all the principles of
Spinozism.” 19 “Leibniz fell into Spinozism whenever he allowed himself
to be logical; in his published works, accordingly, he took care to be
illogical.” 20</p>
<p>His efforts to reconcile Catholicism and Protestantism subjected him
to the charge of indifferentism. 21 His passion for unity and compromise
dominated his theology; while avoiding preachers, he labored to bring
them together. Because he saw deeply he minimized surface diversities;
if Christianity was a form of government, its creedal varieties seemed
to him not instruments of piety and good will but obstacles to order and
peace.</p>
<p>In 1677 the Emperor Leopold I sent Christopher Rojas de Spinola,</p>
<p>titular bishop of Tina in Croatia, to the court of Hanover to suggest
to the Duke, John Frederick, himself a convert to Catholicism, that he
join in a campaign to reunite Protestants with Rome. Probably the plan
had political fringes: the Elector at the time desired the support of
the Emperor, and Leopold hoped for a stronger German unity and spirit
against the Turks. For a while Spinola commuted between Vienna and
Hanover, and the affair progressed. When Bossuet (1682) formulated the
Gallican Declarations by which the French clergy defied the Pope,
Leibniz may have been led to hope that France would join with Germany in
a Catholi- cism sufficiently independent of the papacy to soften
Protestant hostility</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>665</p>
<p>to the ancient creed. In 1683, as the Turks were marching to the
siege of Vienna, Spinola assembled at Hanover a conference of Protestant
and Catholic t heologians, and submitted to them “rules for the
ecclesiastical union of all Christians.”</p>
<p>It was probably for this meeting 22 that Leibniz anonymously composed
the strangest of the many documents that were found among his papers
after his death. It was called Systema Theologicum, and purported to be
such a statement of Catholic doctrine as any Protestant of good will
might accept. In 1819 a Catholic editor published it as evidence that
Leibniz had been secretly converted; more likely it was a diplomatic
effort to reduce the theological gap between the two communions, but the
editor was justified in considering the paper overwhelmingly Catholic.
It began with brief im- partiality:</p>
<p>After invoking the divine aid by long and earnest prayer, putting</p>
<p>aside, so far as is humanly possible, all party spirit, looking at
the</p>
<p>religious controversies as though I had come from another planet, a
humble learner, unacquainted with any of the various communions, bound
by no obligations, I have, after due consideration, arrived at</p>
<p>the conclusions hereinafter set forth. I have deemed it incumbent</p>
<p>upon me to embrace them because Holy Writ, immemorial religious
tradition, the dictates of reason, and the sure testimony of the facts,
seem to me to concur in establishing them in the mind of any unpreju-
diced human being. 23</p>
<p>Thereupon followed a profession of faith in God, Creation, original
sin, purgatory, transubstantiation, monastic vows, invocation of saints,
use of incense, religious images, ecclesiastical vestments, and the
subordination of the state to the Church. 24 This generosity to
Catholicism might cast doubt on the document, but its authenticity as a
work of Leibniz is generally accepted today. 25 Perhaps he hoped, by so
supporting the Catholic view, to prepare for himself a commodious berth
at the court of the Catholic Emperor in Vienna. And, like any good

<p>All these arguments failed to move the Protestants. Louis XIV
disrupted the decor by revoking the Edict of Nantes and making brutal
war upon French Protestants. Leibniz set aside his agape for more
gracious times.</p>
<p>In 1687, to consult scattered archives for his Armais of the House of
Brunswick, he set out on three years of travel through Germany, Austria,
and Italy. In Rome, on the assumption that he would accept conversion,
the authorities offered him the curatorship of the Vatican Library; he
declined. He made a brave attempt to obtain cancellation of the
ecclesiasti- cal decrees against Copernicus and Galileo. 27 After his
return to Hanover he began (1691) three years of correspondence with
Bossuet in the hope of reviving the movement for the reunion of
Christendom. Could not the Roman Church call a really ecumenical
council, one including Protestant as well as Catholic leaders, to r
econsider and revoke the Council of Trent’s harsh branding of
Protestants as heretics? The bishop, who had just bombarded these
“heretics” with his Variations des eglises protestantes (1688), replied
uncompromisingly: if the Protestants wished to re-enter the sacred fold,
let them accept conversion and end the debate. Leibniz begged him to
reconsider. Bossuet held out hope: “I enter into the scheme.’ … You
shall shortly hear what I think.” 28 In 1691 Leibniz wrote to Mme.
Brinon with his usual optimism:</p>
<p>The Emperor is favorably disposed; Pope Innocent XI and a number</p>
<p>of cardinals, generals of monastic orders, . . . and many grave
theo-</p>
<p>logians, having carefully considered the matter, have expressed them-
selves in the most encouraging terms. … It is no exaggeration to say
that if the King of France and the prelates . . . who have his ear
in</p>
<p>this matter were to take concerted action the thing would not be</p>
<p>merely feasible, it would be as good as done. 29</p>
<p>When Bossuet’s answer came it was crushing: the decisions of the
Council of Trent were irrevocable; they had rightly held the Protestants
to be heretics; the Church is infallible; no conference between Catholic
and Protestant leaders could reach any constructive result unless the
Protestants would agree in advance to adopt the decisions of the Church
on the matters at issue. 30 Leibniz replied that the Church had often
changed her views and teaching, had contradicted herself, and had
condemned and excom- municated persons without just cause. He declared
that he “washed his hands of all responsibility for whatever further
ills the existing schism may have in store for the Christian Church.” 31
He turned to the apparently more hopeful task of reconciling the
Lutheran and Calvinist branches of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>66 7</p>
<p>Protestantism, but here he met with an intransigence as hard and
proud as Bossuet’s. At last he privately called down a plague upon all
the rival theologies, and proclaimed that there were only two kinds of
books with any value: those reporting scientific demonstrations or
experiments, and those containing history, politics, or geography. 32
Outwardly, and laxly, he remained a Lutheran to the end of his life.</p>

<li>LOCKE REVIEWED</li>
</ol>
<p>Half of Leibniz’ product was an argumentum ad hominem, undertaken</p>
<p>In form it is a dialogue between Philalethes (Lover of Truth),
repre-</p>
<p>senting Locke, and Theophilus (Lover of God), representing Leibniz.
The dialogue is vigorously sustained, and still makes good reading for
any person of keen mind and endless leisure. The preface shows Leibniz
in his most courteous mood, professing modestly to win readers by
attaching his discourse to “the Essay on the Understanding by a
distinguished English - man, one of the most beautiful and esteemed
works of this period.” The question to be discussed is stated with
laudable clarity: “To know whether</p>
<p>• Locke wrote of the mind at birth as “white paper ,” 84 but did not
use the phrase tabula rasa (clean slate), which was Aquinas’ translation
of a passage in Aristotle’s De animal</p>
<p>6( 58 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XXIII</p>
<p>receptacle of experience; it is a complex organ that by its structure
and functions transforms the data of sensation, just as the digestive
tract is no empty sack but a system of organs for the digestion of food
and its</p>
<p>transformation into the needs and organs of the body. In a famous
epigram Leibniz summarized and amended Locke: Nihil est in intellectu
quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi ipse intellectus — “Nothing is in the
mind that has not been in the senses, except the mind itself” 36 Locke,
as Leibniz noted, had recognized that ideas could come from
introspective “reflection” as well as from external sensation, but had
ascribed to a sensory origin all elements entering into reflection.
Leibniz, on the contrary, argued that the mind of itself supplies
certain principles or categories of thought, such as “being, substance,
unity, identity, cause, perception, reason, and many other notions which
the senses cannot give”; 37 and that these tools of understanding, these
organs of mental digestion, are “innate,” not in the sense that we are
conscious of them at birth, or always conscious of them when we use
them, but in the sense that they are part of the native structure or
“natural</p>
<p>The inheren t principles, in Leibniz’ judgment, include all
“necessary</p>
<p>truths, such as are found in pure mathematics ,” 38 for it is the
mind, not sensation, that supplies the principle of necessity;
everything sensory is individual and contingent, and gives us, at best,
repeated sequence but not necessary sequence or cause . 39 (Locke had
conceded this. 40 ) Leibniz considered innate all our instincts, our
preference of pleasure to pain, and all the laws of reason 41 — though
these become clear only with experience. Among the innate laws of
thought two are especially basic: the principle of contradiction — that
contradictory statements cannot be true at the same time (“if A is a
circle it is not a square”); and the principle of</p>
<p>sufficient reason — “that nothing happens without a reason why it
should be so rather than otherwise .” 42 Human intelligence, Leibniz
thought, differs from animal knowledge by deducing general ideas from
particular experiences through the use of innate principles of reason;
brutes are pure empirics, guiding themselves solely by examples; “so far
as we can judge of them, they never attain to the formation of necessary
propositions .” 43 The principle of sufficient reason suffices to
“demonstrate the being of a</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>66 9</p>
<p>God, and all the other parts of metaphysics or natural theology.” 44
In this sense our idea of God is innate, though in some minds or tribes
the idea may be unconscious or confused; and we may say the same of the
idea of immortality. 45 The moral sense is innate, not in its specific
content or judgments, which may vary in time and place, but as
consciousness of a difference between right and wrong; this
consciousness is universal. 46</p>
<p>In Leibniz’ psyc hology the mind is active not only as entering by
its</p>
<p>structure and functioning into the making of every idea, but also in
the incessant continuance of its activity. Using the word think in
Descartes’ broad sense as including all mental operations, Leibniz
agreed jwith the Cartesians that the mind is always thinking, whether
awake, unconscious, or asleep. “A state without thought in the soul, and
an absolute repose in the body, appear to me equally contrary to nature,
and without example in the world.” 47 Some mental operations are
subconscious; “it is a great error to believe that there is no
perception in the soul besides those of which it is conscious.” 48 It is
with such propositions in Leibniz that modern psy- chology began its
efforts to delve into what some students called un- conscious mind, and
what esprits forts considered to be merely cerebral or other bodily
processes that did not evoke consciousness.</p>
<p>Leibniz has much to say about the relation between body and soul, but
there he leaves psychology, soars into metaphysics, and asks us to see
all the world as psychophysical monads, like ourselves.</p>
<p>V. MONADS</p>
<p>When he was in Vienna in 1714 he met Eugene of Savoy, who, with</p>
<p>Marlborough, had saved Europe from subjection to Louis XIV. The
Prince asked the philosopher for a brief statement of his philosophy in
a form intelligible to a general. Leibniz responded by composing a
compact treatise of ninety paragraphs, which he left among his papers at
his death. A German translation was published in 1720, but the original
French text was not printed till 1839, and then it was the editor who
christened it La Monadologie. Leibniz could have taken the term monad
from Giordano Bruno, 49 or from Frans (son of the chemist J. B.) van
Helmont, 50 who used the word to describe the minute “seeds” which alone
were directly created by God, and which developed into all the forms of
matter and life. An English physician, Francis Glisson, had attributed
not only force but instinct and ideas to all substances (1672). A
similar theory had germi- nated in Leibniz’ roving and receptive mind
since 1686. He may have been influenced by the recent work of
microscopists, who had shown such th robbing life in the smallest cells.
Leibniz concluded that “there is a</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>world of created beings — living things, animals . . . , souls . . .
, in the least part of matter .” 61 Every portion of matter may be
conceived as a pond full of fishes, and every drop of blood in one of
these microscopic fishes is another pond full of fishes, and so on ad
infinitum. He was moved — as Pascal had been appalled — by the
indefinite divisibility of every ex- tended thing.</p>
<p>This endless divisibility, Leibniz suggested, is a puzzle arising
from our conception of reality as matter, therefore as extended,
therefore as divisible ad nauseam. If we consider the ultimate reality
as energy, and conceive the world as composed of centers of force, the
mystery of divisibility vanishes, because force, like thought, does not
imply extension. So he rejected the atoms of Democritus as the ultimate
components of the uni- verse, and replaced them with monads, unextended
units of force; he de- fined substance not as matter but as energy. (Up
to this point Leibniz’ conception was quite in accord with twentieth-
century physics.) “Matter” is everywhere instinct with motion, activity,
and life. Every monad feels or perceives; it has inchoate or incipient
mind, in the sense that it is susceptible — and responds — to external
changes.</p>
<p>We shall understand the monads better if we think of them “in
imitation of the notion that we have of souls .” 52 As each soul is “a
simple, separate Person ,” 53 a solitary ego, solus contra mundum,
fighting its way by its own internal will against everything outside it,
so each monad is essentially alone, a separate, independent center of
force against all other centers of force; reality is a universe of
individual powers, unified and harmonized only through the laws of the
whole, or God. As every soul is different from all others, so is every
monad unique; in the entire cosmos there are no two beings completely
alike, for their differences constitute their individuality; two things
having all the same qualities would be indistinguishable, identi- cal,
one (“the law of indiscemibles”). 54 As each soul feels or perceives the
reality surrounding it, and, ever less clearly, the reality
progressively distant from it, but feels all reality in some degree, so
each monad feels, however confusedly and unconsciously, the whole
universe; in this way it is a mirror more or less obscurely reflecting
and representing the world. And as no individual mind can really look
into another mind, so no single monad can see into another; it has no
window or other opening for such direct communication; and therefore it
cannot directly produce any change in any other monad.</p>
<p>The monads do change, for change is essential to their life; but
the</p>
<p>changes come from their own inner striving . 65 For just as each self
is desire and will, so each monad contains — is — an inner purpose and
will, an effort to develop; this is the “entelechy” that Aristotle spoke
of as the core of every life; in this sense 〔as Schopenhauer was to
say〕 force and</p>
<p>CHAP, xxm)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>671</p>
<p>will are two forms or degrees of the same fundamental reality . 86
There is an immanent teleology in nature: there is in everything a
seeking, an “appetition,” a guiding, molding purpose, even though that
purpose, that</p>
<p>In that diversity the most important feature is the degree in which
the “mind” of the monad is conscious. All monads have mind, in the sense
of sensitivity and response; but not all mind is conscious. Even we
marvelous human beings go through many mental processes without
consciousness, as in dreams; or as when, in our intense attention to
certain aspects of a situation, we are not aware that we are perceiving
many other elements in the scene — elements which may nevertheless be
deposited in memory, enter into our dreams, or emerge from hidden
corners of the mind into later consciousness; or as when, conscious of
the roar and hiss of the surf, we do not realize that each wave, and
each particle of each wave, is beating upon our ears to produce a
thousand individual impressions that become our hearing of the sea. So
the simplest monads feel and perceive every- thing about them, but so
confusedly that they have no consciousness. In plants the feelings
become clearer and more specialized, and lead to more specific
responses. In the monad that is the soul of an animal the echoing
perceptions become memories, whose interplay begets consciousness. Man
is a colony of monads 〔cells?〕, each with its own hunger, needs, and
purposes; but these particles become a unified community of living
organ- isms under the direction of a dominating monad which is man’s
entelechy and soul . 58 “When this soul is raised to the level of
reason, it is . . . reckoned</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of this philosophy is Leibniz’ theory of
“pre - established harmony.” What is the relation between the inner life
of a monad and its outward manifestation, or material shell? And how
shall we</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>explain the apparent interaction of physical body and spiritual mind
in man? Descartes had delegated this problem helplessly to the pineal
gland; Spinoza had answered it by denying any separation or interaction
of matter and mind, since these were, in his view, merely the outside
and inside aspects of one process and reality. Leibniz restored the
problem by think- ing of the two aspects as separate and distinct; he
denied their interaction, but ascribed the simultaneity of the physical
and the mental processes as due to a continuous collusion marvelously
prearranged by God:</p>
<p>The soul follows its own laws, and the body its own likewise, and</p>
<p>they accord by virtue of the harmony pre-established, among all sub-
stances, since they are all representations of one and the same uni-
verse . 61 . . . Bodies act as though, per impossible, there were no
souls, and souls act as if there were no bodies, and both act as if each
influ- enced the other . 62 …Iam… asked how it happens that God is
not</p>
<p>content to produce all the thoughts and modifications of the soul</p>
<p>without these useless bodies which the soul (it is said) can
neither</p>
<p>move nor know. The answer is easy. It is that it was God’s will
that</p>
<p>there should be a greater rather than a lesser number of substances,
and He found it good that these modifications should correspond to some-
thing outside . 63</p>
<p>Suspecting that this debonair exploitation of deity as a substitute
for thought might not win universal applause, Leibniz embellished it
with the occasionalism and timepieces of Geulincx: body and mind, each
operating independently of the other and yet in puzzling harmony, are
like two clocks so skillfully constructed, wound, and set that they tick
off the seconds and strike the hours in perfect agreement, without any
interaction or mutual influence; so the physical and psychical
processes, though quite independent, and never acting upon each other,
accord through a “harmony pre-established by a divine anticipatory
artifice .” 64</p>
<p>Let us assume that what Leibniz had in view, but did not care to say,
was that the apparently separate but synchronous processes of mechanism
and life, of action and thought, are one and the same process, seen ex-
ternally as matter, internally as mind. But to have said this would have
been to repeat Spinoza, and share his fate.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>WAS GOD JUST?</li>
</ol>
<p>This need to put theological clothing upon philosophical nudities led
Leibniz to write the book that drew the ire and wit of Voltaire, and al-
most lost a really profound thinker in the caricature of Professor
Pangloss</p>
<p>CHAP, xxm)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>673</p>
<p>defending the best of all possible worlds. The only complete
philosophical work published by Leibniz in his lifetime was called
Essais de Theodicee sur la bonte de Dieu, la liberte de I’homme, et
I’origine du mal (1710) — almost as comforting a promissory note as
Descartes’ Principles of First Philosophy, in Which are Demonstrated the
Existence of God and the Imm ortality of the Soul (1641). “Theodicy,” of
course, meant the justice, or justification, of God.</p>
<p>This book, like the others, had an occasional origin. In an
article</p>
<p>(“Hieronymus Rorarius”) in the Dictionnaire historique et critique
Bayle, while expressing great admiration for Leibniz, questioned the
philosopher’s view that faith can be reconciled with reason, or man’s
freedom with God’s omnipotence, or earthly evil with divine goodness and
power. We had better, said Bayle, give up the idea of proving religious
creeds; it merely brings the difficulties into clearer light. Leibniz
replied in an essay (1698) contributed to Jacques Basnage’s journal,
Histoire des ouvrages des savants. In the second edition of his
Dictionary Bayle added to the article on</p>
<p>Rorarius a substantial note again hailing Leibniz as “that great
philosopher,” but pointing out further obscurities, especially in the
theory of pre-</p>
<p>established harmony. Leibniz sent (1702) his rejoinder directly to
Bayle, but did not print it. In that same year he wrote again to the
Rotterdam scholar, complimenting him on his “striking reflections” and
“boundless researches.” 65 Few episodes in the history of philosophy are
so pleasant as the mutual courtesy in this exchange of ideas. Sophia
Charlotte, Queen of Prussia, expressed her desire to know Leibniz’
answers to Bayle’s doubts. He was preparing such a statement when news
came to him that Bayle had died. He revised and extended his replies,
and published them as the Theodicee. He was now sixty-four years old,
felt the nearness of the “Great Perhaps,” and may have longed to believe
in the justice of God to man. How had it come about that a world created
by an omnipotent and benevolent deity had been sullied with such martial
massacres, political corruption, human cruelty and suffering,
earthquakes, famines, poverty, and disease?</p>
<p>The “preliminary dissertation on the confronting of faith with
reason” described reason and the Bible as being both of them divine
revelations, and therefore unlikely to contradict each other. Bayle had
wondered how a good God, presumably foreseeing all “the fruit thereof,”
could have allowed the temptation of Eve; Leibniz answered that to make
man capable of morality God had to give him free will, and therefore
freedom to sin. It is true that free will seems incompatible with both
science and theology: science sees everywhere the rule of invariable
law, and human freedom seems lost in God’s foreknowledge and
predestination of all events. Bu t (said Leibniz) we are obstinately and
directly conscious that we are free.</p>
<p>674</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>Though we cannot prove this freedom, we must accept it as a
prerequisite to any sense of moral responsibility, and as the only
alternative to viewing man as a ridiculously helpless physiological
machine.</p>
<p>As to the existence of God, Leibniz is content with traditional
Scholastic arguments. We conceive a perfect being, and since existence
is a necessary element in perfection, a perfect being must exist. There
must be a neces- sary and uncaused being behind all proximate causes and
contingent events. It is inconceivable that the grandeur and order of
nature should have any other source than a Supreme Intelligence. The
Creator must contain in Himself, in an infinite degree, the power,
knowledge, and will discoverable in His creatures. Divine design and
cosmic mechanism are not contra- dictory: Providence uses mechanism its
wonders to perform; and God can interrupt the world machine now and then
to work a miracle or two . 86</p>
<p>Of course the soul is immortal. Death, like birth, is only a change
of</p>
<p>form in an assemblage of monads; the inherent soul and energy remain.
Soul, except in God, is always attached to body, and body to soul; but
there will be a resurrection of the body as well as of the soul . 67
(Leibniz is here a good Catholic.) Below man the immortality of the soul
is im- personal 〔merely a redistribution of energy?〕; only the
rational soul of man will enjoy a conscious immortality.</p>
<p>Good and evil are human terms, defined according to our pleasure and
pain; these terms cannot be applied to the universe without presuming
for man an omniscience possible only t o God. “Imperfection in the part
may be required for a greater perfection in the whole” 68 ; so sin is an
evil, but is a result of free will, which is a good; and even the sin of
Adam and Eve was in some sense a felix culpa, a happy fault, since it
resulted in the coming of Christ . 69 “There is in the universe … no
chaos, no confusion, save in appearance .” 70 The afflictions of men
“contribute to the greater good of those who suffer them .” 71 Even</p>
<p>holding … to the established doctrine that the number of men</p>
<p>damned eternally will be incomparably greater than that of the saved,
we must say that the evil could not but seem to be almost as nothing in
comparison with the good, when one contemplates the true vastness of the
City of God. . . . Since the proportion of that part of the uni-</p>
<p>verse which we know is almost lost in nothing compared with that</p>
<p>which is unknown, … it may be that all evils are almost
nothingness</p>
<p>in comparison with the good things which are in the universe . 72 . .
.</p>
<p>One need not even agree that there is more evil than good in the</p>
<p>human kind! For it is possible, and even a very reasonable thing,
that the glory and perfection of the blessed may be incomparably greater
than the misery and imperfection of the damned . 73</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>675</p>
<p>Imperfect as it may seem to our selfish sight, this world is the best
that God could have created so long as He left men human and free. If a
better world had been possible, we may be sure God would have created
it.</p>
<p>It follows from the supreme perfection of God that in producing</p>
<p>the universe He chose the best possible plan, containing the greatest
variety, together with the greatest order; the best^arranged situation,
place, and time; the greatest effect produced by the simplest means; the
most power, the most knowledge, the most happiness and goodness in
created things, of which the universe admitted. For as all possible
things have a claim to existence in the understanding of God in</p>
<p>proportion to their perfections, the result of all these claims must
be the most perfect actual world which is possible . 74</p>
<p>We cannot recommend any further reading of Leibniz’ Theodicy today,
except to those who would appreciate to the full the bitter laughter of
Candide.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>PARALIPOMENA</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, the Theodicee became the most widely read of Leibniz’
books, and succeeding generations knew him as “the best
-of-all-possible- worlds man.” If we must regret the edifying abs urdity
of that performance, our respect for the author revives when we
contemplate the prodigious variety of his intellectual interests. Though
science was but one corner of his thought, he was fascinated by it; if
he had to live another life, he told Bayle, he would have been a
biologist. 75 He was one of the profoundest mathematicians of an age
rich in mathematicians. He bettered Descartes’ formula for measuring
force.* His conception of matter as energy seemed to his time a bravura
of metaphysics, but it is now a commonplace of physics. He described
matter as our confused perception of the operations of force. Like our
contemporary theorists he rejected the “absolute mo - tion” assumed by
Newton; motion, said Leibniz, “is simply change in the relative position
of bodies, and thus is nothing absolute, but consists in a relation.” 76
Anticipating Kant, he interpreted space and time not as ob - jective
realities but as perceptual relations: space as perceived coexistence,
time as perceived succession — views adopted in relativity theories
today. In his final year (1715) Leibniz entered into a long
correspondence with Samuel Clarke about gravitation; this seemed to him
another occult quality,</p>
<p>• Descartes’ formula was mv — force is mass times velocity. Leibniz,
on the basis of Galileo’s work, changed this to mv 2 . The current

<p>acting at enormous distances through an apparent void; it would be,
he objected, a perpetual mira cle; no greater, replied Clarke, than “pre
- established harmony.” 77 Leibniz feared that Newton’s theory of the
cosmic mechanism would make many atheists; on the contrary, said Clarke,
the majestic order revealed by Newton would strengthen the belief in
God; 78 the aftermath justified Leibniz.</p>
<p>In biology Leibniz vaguely visioned evolution. Like many thinkers be-
fore and after him he saw a “law of continuity” running through the</p>
<p>Nothing is accomplished all at once, and it is one of my great</p>
<p>maxims . . . that nature makes no leaps. . . . This law of
continuity</p>
<p>declares that we pass from the small to the great — and the reverse-
through the medium, in degree as well as in parts. 80 〔This is now</p>
<p>questioned by many physicists.〕 . . . Men are linked with animals,
these with plants, and these again with fossils, which in their turn are
con- nected with those bodies which sense and imagination represent to
us as completely dead and inorganic. 81</p>
<p>In this majestic continuity all antitheses dissolve through a great
chain of being and hardly perceptible differences, from the simplest
matter to the most complex, from the lowliest animalcule to the greatest
ruler, genius, or saint.</p>
<p>Leibniz’ mind see med to span the whole continuity that he described.
He was au courant with every science; he knew the history of nations and
of philosophy; he touched the worldly affairs of a dozen states; he was
at home with atoms and with God. In 1693 he published a paper on the
beginnings of the earth, quietly ignoring Genesis, and he developed his
geological ideas in a treatise, Protogaea, which was published (1749)
after his death. Our planet, he thought, had once been an incandescent
globe; it gradually cooled, contracted, and formed a crust; as it
cooled, the vapor surrounding it condensed into water and oceans — which
became salty by dissolving minerals in the crust. Subsequent geological
changes were due either to the action of water flooding the surface,
leaving sedimentary formations, or to the explosion of subterranean
gases, leaving igneous rocks. The same treatise gave an excellent
explanation of fossils, 82 and advanced toward a theory of evolution. It
seemed to him “worthy of belief that in the course of vast changes” in
the crust of the earth “even the species of animals have many times been
transformed.” 83 He thought</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>LEIBNIZ</p>
<p>677</p>
<p>it probable that the earliest animals were marine forms, and that the
amphibia and land animals were descended from these. 84 Like some opti-
mists of the nineteenth century, he saw in this evolutionary
transformism one basis for faith in “a perpetual and unrestricted
progress of the uni - verse. . . . Progress will never come to an end.”
86</p>
<p>From biology Leibniz jumped to Roman law, and from this to Chinese
philosophy. His Novissima Sinaica (1697) — “the latest news from China”
— eagerly took up the reports that missionaries and merchants were send-
ing from the “Middle Kingdom.” He held it probable that in philosophy,
mathematics, and medicine the Chinese had made discoveries which might
be of great help to Western civilization, and he urged cultural links
with Russia partly as a means of opening cultural communication with the
East. He corresponded with scholars, scientists, and statesmen in twenty
coun- tries and three languages. He wrote some three hundred letters
every year; fifteen thousand of them have been preserved; 86 Voltaire’s
corresp ondence rivals this in quantity, but yields to it in
intellectual diversity. Leibniz suggested an international culture
bourse, or exchange, through which men of learning could compare notes
and ideas. 87 He planned an inter- national language — “characteristica
universalis” — in which each idea in philosophy and science would have
its symbol or character, so that thinkers could manipulate notions by
this ars combinatoria, just as mathematicians used signs for quantities;
so he came close to founding mathematical or symbolic logic. 88 By a
kind of noble futility he distributed himself into so many areas that he
left hardly anything but fragments behind him.</p>
<p>Our eager polymath found no time for marriage. At last, aged fifty,
he proposed; but, say s Fontenelle, “the lady asked for time to take the
matter</p>
<p>He dreamed of establishing academies in the great capitals, and suc-
ceeded in one. The Berlin Academy was founded ( 1 700) on his
initiative, and elected him its first president. He met Peter the Great
at Torgau (1712), and again at Carlsbad and Pyrmont; he proposed a
similar academy for St. Petersburg; the Czar loaded him with gifts, and
adopted his sug- gestion for governing Russia through administrative
“colleges”; but Leibniz did not live to see the Academy of
St. Petersburg take form in 1724. In</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>1712 we find him in Vienna, itching for an Imperial post and pregnant
with another academy; he submitted to Charles VI a plan for an institu-
tion that would promote not only science but education, agriculture, and
industry; and he offered his services to direct it. The Emperor raised
him to the ranks of the nobility, and made him an Imperial councilor
(1712).</p>
<p>His long absences from Hanover angered the new Elector George;</p>
<p>Leibniz’ salary was for a period discontinued, and he was warned that
it was time, after a quarter century of interruptions, that he should
finish his history of the house of Brunswick. When Queen Anne died,
George left Hanover to take the throne of England. Three days after this
de- parture Leibniz arrived from Vieniia (1714). He had hoped to be
taken to London and enjoy there some loftier office and emoluments; he
sent conciliatory letters to the new King; but George I answered that
until the Annals were complete Leibniz had better remain in Hanover. 91
Besides, England had not forgiven him for disputing with Newton the
parentage of calculus.</p>
<p>Disappointed and lonely, he struggled for two years more to believe
in the good intentions of the universe. The man who was remembered in
the eighteenth century as the apostle of optimism died in pain of gout
and stone at Hanover on November 14, 1716. His death was not noticed by
the Berlin Academy, nor by the German courtiers in London, nor by any
friends at home, for these had been alienated by his absences and his
privacy. No clergyman came to administer religious rites to the
philosopher who had defended religion against philosophy. One man alone,
his former secretary, attended the funeral. A Scotsman then in Hanover
wrote that Leibniz “was buried more like a robber th an what he really
was, the ornament of his country.” 92</p>
<p>We must not spend space marking the flaws in this polymorphous multi-
tude of ideas; time has long since performed these unpleasant obsequies.
Critics have charged Leibniz with ubiquitous borrowing: they have found
his psychology in Plato, his theodicy in the Scholastics, his monads in
Bruno, his metaphysics, ethics, and mind-and-body relation in Spinoza.
But who can say anything on these problems but what has been said a
hundred times before? It is easier to be original and foolish than to be
original and wise; there are a thousand possible errors for every truth,
and mankind, with all its efforts, has not yet exhausted the
possibilities. There is much nonsense in Leibniz, but we cannot quite
decide whether it was honest nonsense or protective discoloration. So he
tells us that when God created the world He saw in a flash, in its most
minute detail, everything that was to happen in history. 93 “I always
begin as a philosopher,” he said, “but I always end up as a theologian”
94 — i.e., he felt that philosophy missed its aim if it did not lead to
virtue and piety.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) LEIBNIZ 679</p>
<p>His long and genial debate with Locke gave him one of his many claims
to s ignificant thought. He may have exaggerated the innateness of
“innate ideas,” but he admitted that they were capacities, instincts, or
aptitudes rather than ideas; and he succeeded in showing that Locke’s
sensationism had oversimplified the process of k nowledge, and that
“mind” is by its nature — if only crudely at birth — an organ for the
active reception, manip- ulation, and transformation of sensations;
here, as in his views of space and time, Leibniz stands high as a
precursor of Kant. The doctrine of monads is shot through with
difficulties (if they are not extended, how can any number of them
produce extension? if they “perceive” the universe, how can they be
immune to external influence?), but it was an illuminating attempt to
bridge the chasm between mind and matter by making matter mental rather
than mind material. Of course Leibniz failed to reconcile mechanism and
design in nature, or mechanism in the body with freedom in the will; and
his reseparation of mind and body after Spinoza had united them in one
two-sided process was a step backward in philosophy. His pretense that
this is the best of all possible worlds was the gallant or hope- ful
effort of a courtier to comfort a queen. The most learned of philoso-
phers (“a whole academy in himself,” Frederick the Great called him)
wrote theology as if nothing had happened in the history of thought
since St. Augustine. But with all his shortcomings his achievements in
science and philosophy were immense. Patr iot and yet “good European,”
he re - stored Germany to a high place in the development of Western
civiliza- tion. “Of all who made Germany illustrious,” wrote Frederick
II, “those rendering the greatest service to the human spirit were
Thomasius and Lei bniz.” 95</p>
<p>His influence diminished as his theology lost face before the moral
con- sciousness of mankind. Within a generation after his death his
philosophy was given a systematic reformulation by Christian von Wolff,
and in this modified form it became the dominant fashion of thought in
the German universities. Outside Germany his influence was slight.
Though most of his writings were in French, they were too fragmentary to
exert any con- sistent or concentrated force; no collected edition
appeared till 1768, and even then some important but heterodox items
were excluded, and had to wait till 1901 to venture into print. His
calculus notation was destined to victory, but for half a century his
rivals, Newton and Locke, carried every- thing before them, and became
the idols of the French Enlightenment. Yet even amid that ecstasy of
reason Buffon ranked Leibniz as the greatest genius of his age. 98 The
outstanding German thinker of the twentieth century, Oswald Spengler,
considered Leibniz “without doubt the greatest</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>To round out these superlatives we may add that, all in all, the
seven- teenth century was the most productive in the history of modern
thought. Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Bayle, Leibniz: here
was a majestic sequence of men warm with the wine of reason, joyfully
confident (most of them) that they could understand the universe, even
to forming “clear and distinct ideas” about God, and leading — all but
the last — to that heady Enlightenment which was to convulse both
religion and gov- ernment in the French Revolution. Leibniz foresaw that
terminus; and while he continued to the end to defend freedom of speech,
98 he urged freethinkers to consider the effect of their spoken or
written words upon the morals and spirit of the people. About 1700, in
the Nouveaux Essais , he uttered a remarkable warning:</p>
<p>If fairness wishes to spare persons (freethinkers), piety demands the
representation, where it is fitting, of the bad effects of their dogmas
when they are . . . contrary to 〔belief in〕 the providence of a
perfectly wise, good, and just God, and contrary to that immortality of
souls</p>
<p>which renders them susceptible to the effects of His justice, not
to</p>
<p>speak of other opinions dangerous as regards morality and the
police.</p>
<p>I know that excellent and well-meaning men maintain that these</p>
<p>theoretic opinions have less influence upon practice than is thought,
and I also know that there are persons of an excellent disposition</p>
<p>whom these opinions will never make do anything unworthy of them-
selves. … It may be said that Epicurus and Spinoza, for example, have
led a life wholly exemplary. But these reasons cease most frequently in
their disciples or imitators, who, believing themselves released from
the troublesome fear of an overseeing Providence and of a menacing
future, give loose reins to their brutish passions, and turn their minds
to the seduction and corruption of others; and if they are ambitious,
and of a disposition somewhat harsh, they will be capable, for their</p>
<p>pleasure or advancement, of setting on fire the four corners of
the</p>
<p>earth. I have known this from the character of some whom death has
swept away. I find also that similar opinions, insinuating themselves
little by little into the minds of men of high life who rule others, and
upon whom affairs depend, and slipping into the books of fashion,</p>
<p>dispose all things to the general revolution with which Europe is</p>
<p>threatened.“</p>
<p>There is a spirit of sincere concern in these lines, and we must
respect the counsel of caution that they express. And yet, even after
the Enlighten- ment had crumbled creeds, and the French Revolution had
set on fire the four corners of the earth, and the September massacres
had transiently sated the thirst of the gods, a major historian could
look back to this first</p>

<p>age of modern science and philosophy and see its adventurers not as
destroyers of civilization but as liberators of mankind. Said Lecky:</p>
<p>It was thus that the great teachers of the seventeenth century . .
.</p>
<p>disciplined the minds of men for impartial inquiry, and, having
broken the spell that so long had bound them, produced a passionate love
of truth which has revolutionized all departments of knowledge. It is to
the impulse which was then communicated that may be traced a great
critical movement which has renovated all history, all science, all</p>
<p>theology — which has penetrated into the obscurest recesses, destroy-
ing old prejudices, dispelling illusions, rearranging . . . our
knowledge, and altering the whole scope and character of our sympathies.
But all this would have been impossible but for the diffusion of a
rationalistic spirit . 100</p>
<p>So, for good or ill, the seventeenth century laid the foundations
of</p>
<p>modern thought. The Renaissance was tied to classical antiquity and
to Catholic ritual and art; the Reformation was bound to primitive
Chris- tianity and a medieval creed. Now this rich and fateful era, from
Galileo to Newton, from Descartes to Bayle, from Bacon to Locke, turned
its face toward an uncharted future that promised all the dangers of
liberty. It deserved, perhaps even more than the eighteenth century, the
name Age of Reason; for though its thinkers were still the voices of a
small minority, they displayed a wiser moderation, a deeper sounding of
the limits and difficulties of reason and freedom, than the unmoored
protagonists of the French Enlightenment. In any case the greatest drama
in modem history had played its second act, and moved on to its
fulfillment.</p>
