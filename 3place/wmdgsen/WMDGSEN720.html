<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>XThe Worship of Beauty</p>
<p>I. THE TRIUMPH OF ROCOCO</p>
<p>I N this age between the Regency and the Seven Years’ War— the age of
le style Louis Quinze — women challenged the gods for adoration, and the
pursuit of beauty rivaled the devotions of piety and the passions of
war. In art and music, as in science and philosophy, the supernatural
receded be- fore the natural. The ascendancy of a woman over a sensual
and sensitive king gave new prestige to delicacy and sentiment; the
hedonistic orientation of life that had begun under Philippe d’Orleans
reached its fullest expres - sion under Pompadour. Beauty became more
than ever a matt er of “tactile values”; it was something pleasant to
touch as well as to behold, from Sevres porcelains to Boucher’s nudes.
The sublime gave place to the delight - ful, the dignified to the
graceful, the grandeur of size to the charm of ele- gance. Rococo was
the art of an epicurean moneyed minority eager to en- joy every pleasure
before the disappearance of its fragile world in an anticipated deluge
of change. In that frankly earthly style lines gamboled, colors
softened, flowers had no thorns, subjects shunned tragedy to stress the
bright potentialities of life. Rococo was the last stage of baroque, of
the rebellion of imagination against reality, of freedom against order
and rules. Yet it was not disorderly license; its products still had
logic and structure, giving form to significance; but it abhorred
straight lines and sharp angles, it shied away from symmetry, and found
it painful to leave any piece of furniture uncarved. Despite its
coquettish prettiness, rococo produced thousands of objects unsurpassed
in finish and elegance. And for half a cen- tury it made the minor arts
the major art of France.</p>
<p>Never before, so far as we know, had there been such activity, rarely
such excellence, in the once lesser fields of aesthetic enterprise. In
this pe- riod the artist and the artisan were again made one, as in
medieval Europe, and those who could beautify the intimate appurtenances
of life were hon- ored with the painters, sculptors, and architects of
the age.</p>
<p>Never before had furniture been so exquisite. In this “style of
Louis</p>
<p>Fifteenth” it was no longer so monumental as under the Great King; it
was designed for comfort rather than for dignity; it was more fitted to
feminine contours and finery than to majesty and display. Sofas took on
a diversity of</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xshapes to suit attitudes and moods; “today,” Voltaire wrote, “social
behav - ior is easier than in the past,” and “ladies can be seen reading
on sofas or daybeds without causing embarrassment to their friends and
acquaint- ances.” 1 Beds were crowned with delicate canopies, their
panels were</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>chiffonier, the buffet — these took now the forms, often the names,
that they have in essence retained to our time. Carving and other
ornamentation were profuse to an extent that provoked a reaction in the
second half of the cen- tury. The “buhlwork” introduced by Andre Charles
Boulle under Louis XIV — an inlay of furniture with metal or shell — was
carried on by his sons as cabinetmakers to Louis XV; and a dozen
variations of marquetry broke up the surface of painted, veneered, or
lacquered wood. Voltaire ranked some lacquerwork of eighteenth-century
France as equal to any that had come from China or Japan. Craftsmen like
Cressent, Oppenordt, Oeben, Caffieri, and Meissonier achieved such
pre-eminence in the design or adorn- ment of furniture that
cabinetmakers came from abroad to study their tech- niques, and then
spread French styles from London to St. Petersburg. Juste Aurele
Meissonier included in one mind a dozen arts: he built houses, deco-
rated their interiors, fashioned furniture, molded candlesticks and
silver- ware, designed snuffboxes and watch cases, organized pompes
funebres or galantes, and wrote several works to transmit his skills; he
was almost the uomo universale of his time.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the ceremonious publicity of the seventeenth century was replaced
by the intimacies of life under Louis XV, interior decoration passed
from splendor to refinement; and here again the age marked a zenith.
Furniture, carpets, upholstery, objets d’art, clocks, mirrors, panels,
tapestries, drapes, paintings, ceilings, chandeliers, even bookcases
were brought into gratify- ing harmonies of color and style. Sometimes,
we may suspect, books were bought for the color and texture of their
bindings as well as for their con- tents; but we can understand that
pleasure too, and we gaze with envy at personal libraries housed behind
glass in handsome cases set into the wall. Dining rooms were rare in
France before 1750; dining tables were usually made to be easily
multiplied and removed, for dinner guests might be in- calculably
numerous. Chimneypieces were no longer the massive monu- ments that had
come down from the Middle Ages to Louis XIV, but they were richly
embellished, and now and then (a rare instance of poor taste in this
period) female figures were used as caryatids upholding the mantel-
piece. Heating was almost entirely by open fireplaces, protected by
orna-</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY</p>
<p>mental screens, but here and there we find in France a stove faced,
as in Germany, with decorated faience. Lighting was by candles in a
hundred different fixtures, culminating in immense and glittering
chandeliers of rock crystal, glass, or bronze. We marvel at the amount
of reading that was done by candlelight; but perhaps the difficulties
diminished the production and consumption of trash.</p>
<p>Wall panels, lightly colored and delicately adorned, replaced
tapestries as the century advanced, and in this period the art of
tapestry had its final flowering. In almost every variety of textiles —
from damasks, embroideries, and brocade to immense carpets and drapes —
France now challenged the finest weaves of the Orient. Amiens
specialized in pictured velvets; Lyons, Tours, and Nimes were famous for
decorated silks; in Lyons Jean Pille- ment, Jean Baptiste Huet, and
others made wall hangings stamped and sewn with Chinese or Turkish
motifs and scenes that captivated Pompa- dour. Tapestries were woven in
the nationalized factories of Paris and Beau- vais, and in private shops
at Aubusson and Lille. They had by this time lost their utilitarian
function of protecting against damp and drafts; they were purely
decorative, and were often reduced in size to suit the tendency to
smaller rooms. The weavers at Les Gobelins and Beauvais followed designs
prepared, and the colors prescribed, by the leading painters of the age.
Especially beautiful were the fifteen tapestries woven by the Gobelins
(1717) after cartoons provided by Charles Antoine Coypel to illustrate
Don Quixote. The Beauvais weavers, as we shall see, produced some fine
tapestries after designs by Boucher. The Savonneries — originally soap
works —were reorganized in 1712 as the “Royal Factory for the
Manufacture of Carpets in the Persian and Near- Eastern Styles”; soon
they were weaving massive carpets distinguished by careful drawing,
varied colors, and soft velvet pile; these are the finest pile carpets
of eighteenth-century France. It was the tapestry factories that made
the painstaking upholstery for the chairs of the well-to-do. Many humble
fingers must have been worn to calluses to prevent the same on thriving
fundaments.</p>
<p>French potters were entering upon an adventurous age. The wars of
Louis XIV gave them an opportunity: the old King melted his silver to
finance his armies; he replaced his silverware with faience, and bade
his sub- jects do likewise; soon the faience factories at Rouen, Lille,
Sceaux, Stras- bourg, Moustiers-Ste.-Marie, and Marseilles were meeting
this new demand; and after the death of Louis XIV the taste for dishes
and other objects in faience encouraged the potters to produce some of
the finest wares of the kind in European history. Artists as famous as
Boucher, Falconet, and Pajou painted scenes or molded forms for French
faience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile France was moving toward the production of porcelain. Soft-
paste varieties had long since been made in Europe — as far back as 1581
in</p>
<p>3°6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XFlorence, 1673 in Rouen. These, however, were imitations of Chinese
ex- emplars; they were made not from the hard-paste kaolin, or
china-stone clay, as fused at high temperatures in the Far East, but
from softer clays fired at low temperatures and covered with a glossy
“frit.” Even so, these pate-tendre porcelains — especially those fired
at Chantilly, Vincennes, and Mennecy-Villeroi (near Paris) — were very
beautiful. Hard-paste porcelain continued to be imported from China or
Dresden. In 1749 Mme. de Pompa- dour coaxed 100,000 livres from Louis
XV, and 250,000 from private sources, to expand the production of
soft-paste wares at Vincennes. In 1756 she had Vincennes’ hundred
artisans moved to a more commodious building at Sevres (between Paris
and Versailles), and there, in 1769, France began to make true
hard-paste porcelain.</p>
<p>Goldsmiths and silversmiths had the advantage that the French
monarchy used their products as a national reserve, transferring bullion
into extrava- gant forms of beauty that could be readily fused in
emergency. Under Louis XV the middle classes enlarged the demand for
silverware as utensils and decoration. Almost every type of cutlery now
used took its present form in eighteenth-century France: oyster forks,
ice spoons, sugar spoons, hunting services, traveling services, folding
knives and forks; add exqui- sitely carved or molded salt cellars,
teapots, ewers, jugs, toilet articles, can- dlesticks . . . ; in this
field the Louis Quinze is “the purest of all French styles.” 2 The
goldsmiths and silversmiths made also the little boxes that men</p>
<p>Metalwork bore the mark of the age in its delicate pattern and
finish. Andirons took fabulous forms in intricate designs, usually of
fantastic ani- mals. Gilt bronze was used to make or decorate andirons,
torches, candela- bras, or chandeliers, or to mount clocks, barometers,
porcelain, or jade; the eighteenth century was the heyday of modern
bronze. Clocks could be monsters — watches could be gems — of bronze,
enamel, silver, or gold, chased in the most exquisite style. Torches
were in some cases masterpieces of sculpture, like that which Falconet
made for Versailles. Miniatures and me- dallions were among the
temptations of the time. One family, the Roettiers, produced within a
century five graveurs de medailles, all so distinguished for their work
that they were welcomed into the Academie Royale des Beaux- Arts along
with the greatest painters and sculptors. It was in the little things of
life that the eighteenth century displayed its most careless wealth</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY 307</p>
<p>and most careful art. “Those who have not lived before 1789,” said
Talley - rand, “will never know how sweet life could be” 3 — if one
could choose his class and dodge the guillotine.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ARCHITECTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Architecture almost ignored rococo. Styles change less readily in
building than in decoration, for the requirements of stability are less
fluid than the tides of taste. The Academie Royale de 1 ’ Architecture,
organized by Colbert in 1 671, was now led by inheritors of the Louis
XIV traditions. Robert de Cotte contin- ued the work of Jules
Hardouin-Mansard, who had completed the Palace of Versailles; Germain
Boffrand was a pupil of Mansard; Jacques Jules Gabriel and his son
Jacques Ange were collateral descendants of Mansard; so the stream of
talent obdurately dug its bed. These men preserved the baroque, even the
semi- classical, exteriors of the grand siecle with columns, capitals,
architraves, and cupolas; but many of their constructions allowed a
frolic of rococo within.</p>
<p>The decline of faith left little stimulus for new churches; two old
ones, how- ever, had their facades renewed. Robert de Cotte faced
St.-Roch with classical columns and pediment (1736), and Jean Nicolas
Servandoni provided St.-Sulpice (1733-45) with a massive two-storied
portico of Doric and Ionic colonnades in somber Palladian style. But it
was secular architecture that expressed the spirit of the age. Several
of the palaces built in this period later became national ministries or
foreign embassies: so the Hotel de Matignon (1721) became the Austrian
embassy, and then the home of the prime minister; the Palais-Bourbon
(1722-50) was partly incorporated into the Chambre des Deputes; the
Hotel de Soubise (remodeled in 1742) became the Archives Nationales.</p>
<p>Under the Marquis de Marigny as commissioner of buildings a large
number of architects, sculptors, painters, and decorators prospered; he
found lodgings and commissions for them, and saw that they were
adequately paid. His favorite architect was Jacques Ange Gabriel, who
accepted wholeheartedly the classical tradition. After the Peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) Edme Bouchardon was engaged to cast an equestrian
statue of Louis XV, and Gabriel was asked to de- sign the entourage for
this monument. Around an open space between the Jar- dins des Tuileries
and the Champs-filysees he placed a ring of balustrades and sunken
gardens; on the north side he raised the present Hotel Crillon and the
present Ministry of the Marine, both in purely classic form; and to
adorn the square he set up four mythological figures, which the
Parisians soon named after the royal mistresses — Mailly, Vintimille,
Chateauroux, and Pompadour. The square was named Place Louis Quinze; now
we call it Place de la Concorde. It is a comfort to know that there were
traffic jams there two hundred years ago. This same James Angel Gabriel
in 1752 built the perfectly proportioned ficole Militaire, whose
Corinthian columns are as graceful as any in the Roman Forum.</p>
<p>It was not only Paris that had its face remodeled in this reign. At
Chantilly the Due de Bourbon engaged Jean Aubert to set up for his
horses and dogs</p>
<p>3°8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xstables so palatial as to invite contrast with the cottages of the
peasants. In Lor- raine Stanislas Leszczynski made Nancy one of the
fairest cities in France. There Boffrand finished the cathedral that had
been begun by his master Jules Hardouin-Mansard. Emmanuel Here de Corny
laid out (1750- 57) the “New City” at Nancy: a rococo Hotel de Ville, or
City Hall; the Place Stanislas, lead - ing through a public garden and a
triumphal arch to the Place de la Carriere and the Palais du
Gouvernement; and Jean Lamour guarded this Place Stanislas with iron
grilles (1751-55) that are the finest of their kind in modern art. Lyons
now gave itself the Place Louis-le-Grand; Nantes, Rouen, Reims, and
Bordeaux each opened a Place Royale; Toulouse raised a noble Capitole;
Rouen provided lovely fountains; stately bridges beautified Sens,
Nantes, and Blois; and Mont- pellier spread out its promenade. Between
1730 and 1760 Jean Jacques Gabriel transformed Bordeaux into a modern
city with open squares, wide avenues, airy parks, a handsome waterfront,
and public buildings in majestic Renaissance style.</p>
<p>Finally French architecture crossed frontiers; French architects were
com- missioned to build in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Russia, Italy,
Spain. By the middle of the century, when France was declining in
military power and political prestige, she reached the height of her
influence in manners and art.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>SCULPTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Sculpture in this period was fighting an angry struggle for
recognition as a major art. Its function had long been mainly
decorative; but whereas under Louis XIV it had commissions to adorn
great palaces and extensive gardens, it was less favored now that the
royal passion for building had exhausted itself and France. The rich
were hiding in smaller structures, and heroic statuary found no place in
drawing rooms and boudoirs. Sculptors complained that the Academie
Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture gave most of its prizes to painters;
Pigalle proposed that there be a royal sculptor as well as a royal
painter, and personally campaigned for the order of St.-Michel to break
down the tradition that only painters received this reward. Reluctantly
the sculptors turned to decorating homes with small pieces, vases, and
reliefs, and sought to rival the portrait painters by giving to
decaying, paying flesh the illusion of lasting bronze or stone. Some of
them, entering more intimately into the home, adopted the elegance,
naturalness, and playfulness of rococo, while still favoring the
sobriety of classic lines.</p>
<p>As with painters and artisans, the sculptor’s art tended to run in
families. Nicolas Coustou helped his teacher, Antoine Coysevox, to
decorate the royal palaces at Marly and Versailles; he designed the
great figures, symbolizing French rivers, that are now in the Hotel de
Ville at Lyons; his Descent from the Cross is still in
Notre-Dame-de-Paris; and his Berger Chasseur is one of a dozen masterly
statues that face time and weather in the Gardens of the Tuiler- ies.
Nicolas’ younger brother, Guillaume Coustou I, turned Marie Leszczynska
into marble as Juno, 4 and carved the powerful Horses of Marly (1740-45)
—</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY</p>
<p>309</p>
<p>originally for that palace, but now rebelling against the bridle at
the west and east approaches to the Place de la Concorde. Guillaume’s
son, Guillaume Cous - tou II, made for the Dauphin the tomb in the
cathedral of Sens.</p>
<p>Nancy gave birth to another artistic dynasty. Jacob Sigisbert Adam
trans- mitted sculpture and architecture to three sons. Lambert
Sigisbert Adam, after ten years of tutelage in Rome, went up to Paris,
where he collaborated with his younger brother, Nicolas Sebastien, in
designing the Neptune and Amphitrite Fountain in the gardens of
Versailles. Then he moved to Potsdam and carved for Frederick the Great,
as gifts from Louis XV, two marble groups — Hunting and Fishing — for
the grounds of Sanssouci. Nicolas Sebastien returned to Nancy and
designed the tomb of Katharin Opalinska in the Church of Notre-
Dame-de-Bon-Secours. A third brother, Frangois Balthasar Gaspard, helped
to decorate Stanislas’ capital.</p>
<p>A third family of sculptors began with Filippo Caffieri, who left
Italy in 1660 to work with his son Frangois Charles for Louis XIV.
Another son, Jacques Caffieri, brought the genius of the line to its
peak, surpassing all his contempo- raries as a worker in bronze. Nearly
all the royal palaces competed for his time. At Versailles he and his
son Philippe adorned the chimney piece in the apart- ment of the
Dauphin, and made the rococo bronze pedestal for the King’s famous
astronomical clock. The bronze mounts that Jacques made for furniture
are now treasured beyond the furniture itself. 5</p>
<p>Edme Bouchardon, whom Voltaire called “our Pheidias,” 6 accepted com
- pletely the classical principles proclaimed by his patron the Comte de
Caylus. For many years he labored in rivalry with Pigalle, until Pigalle
thought himself surpassed; Diderot quoted the younger sculptor as saying
that he had “never entered Bouchardon’s studio without coming out with a
sense of discourage - ment that lasted entire weeks.” 7 Diderot thought
that Bouchardon’s Amour (Cupid ) 8 was destined to immortality, but it
hardly catches the fire of love. Better is the fountain that the
sculptor carved for the Rue de Grenelle in Paris — a masterpiece of
classic dignity and strength. In 1749 the city commissioned him to
execute an equestrian statue of Louis XV. He worked on it nine years,
cast it in 1758, but did not live to see it set up. Dying (1762), he
asked the municipal authorities to let Pigalle finish the enterprise; so
their long rivalry ended in a gesture of admiration and trust. The
statue was erected in the Place Louis Quinze, and was demolished as a
hated emblem by the Revolution (1792).</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste Lemoyne rejected classical restraints as sentencing
sculpture to death. Why should not marble or bronze, as well as
pictorial tempera or oil, express movement, feeling, laughter, joy, and
grief — as, indeed, Hellenistic statu- ary had dared to do? In that
spirit Lemoyne designed the tombs of Cardinal Fleury and the painter
Pierre Mignard for the Church of St.-Roch. So, in the Montesquieu that
he carved for Bordeaux, he showed the author of The Spirit of Laws as a
quizzical, melancholy skeptic, a cross between a Roman senator and a
provincial philosopher smiling at Parisian ways. That fleeting smile be-
came almost the identifying signature of the many portrait busts that
Lemoyne made, by order of the King, to commemorate divers worthies of
France. This</p>
<p>3io</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xlively expressionistic style triumphed over the classicism of
Bouchardon and passed down to Pigalle, Pajou, Houdon, and Falconet in
one of the great ages of sculpture in France.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>PAINTING</li>
</ol>
<p>The commanding artists were now the painters, and the dominance of
Boucher reflected again the influence of women on the arts. The Marquise
de Pompadour felt that painters had dallied long enough with Roman he-
roes, Christian martyrs, and Greek gods; let them see the loveliness of
living women in the finery of their costume or the rosiness of their
flesh; let them catch in line and color the unprecedented elegance of
the age in features, manners, dress, and all the accessories of an
affluent minority life. Woman, once a sin, proclaimed herself still a
sin, but only to be more tempting; she revenged herself on those
frightened centuries in which she had been hu- miliated by the Church as
the mother and agent of damnation, and had been admitted to a
eunuch-conceived Paradise only through the virginity of the Mother of
God. Nothing could more boldly announce the decline of re- ligion in
France than the displacement of the Virgin in French art.</p>
<p>The King, the aristocracy, and the financiers replaced the Church

<p>patronage. In Paris the painters’ Academie de St. -Luc served as a
rival and prod to the conservative Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts; and
in the provinces additional academies sprang up at Lyons, Nancy, Metz,
Mar- seilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Pau, Dijon, and
Reims. Besides the annual Prix de Rome a dozen competitions and prizes
kept the art world in movement and ferment; and sometimes the King or
another patron would console losers by buying their entries or
pensioning them for a stay in Italy.</p>
<p>Artists displayed their paintings in the streets; on some religious
festivals they pinned them to the hangings that the pious draped from
their win- dows on processional routes. To discourage what seemed to
established artists an unseemly procedure, the Academie des Beaux-Arts,
after an in- terruption of thirty-three years, resumed in 1737, in the
Salon Carre of the Louvre, the public exhibition of contemporary
paintings and sculpture. This annual — or, after 1751, biennial —
“Salon” became, in late August and through September, an exciting event
in the artistic and social life of Paris, and in the literary world. The
war between conservatives in the Academy and rebels in or out of it made
art a battle rivaling sex and war in the gossip of the capital; devotees
of chaste line and corrective discipline scorned, and were scorned by,
protagonists of color, experiment, innovation, liberty. Art criticism
became a flourishing enterprise. The Reflexions sur la peinture</p>

<li>of Comte de Caylus were read to a full concourse of the Academie;
Grimm reported the exhibitions to the clients of his letters; and
Diderot came out of his war on Christianity to emerge as the most
controversial art critic of the time. Engravers like Jacques Le Blon and
Laurent Cars spread the flutter by disseminating prints of famous works,
by illustrating books, and by producing masterpieces of their own.

<p>Never, except in religious art, had artists won so keen a public, or

<p>So many painters rose to prominence in this period that merely to
men- tion them would dam our stream. We shall look more carefully at
Boucher, Chardin, and La Tour, but there are others who would be shocked
to be ignored.</p>
<p>There was the brilliant but lackadaisical Jean Francois de Troy,
too</p>
<p>handsome to be great; everybody loved him, and he agreed sufficiently
to use his own features as those of Christ in The Agony in the Garden .
9 He judged it more pleasant to seduce women than to picture them, and
left behind him many broken hearts and blemished works. — Francois (not
to be confused with the sculptor Jean Baptiste) Lemoyne decorated the

<p>Jean Marc Nattier was the vogue in portraiture, for he knew how to
re- deem with pose, color, and the play of light the defects with which
birth or life had flawed his sitters; all but one of the ladies he
painted were pleased to find themselves, on his canvases, as alluring as
they had always believed themselves to be. His Madame de Pompadour hangs
in Versailles- lovely tinted hair, and gentle eyes hardly revealing her
will to power. Roy- alty competed for Nattier: he showed Marie
Leszczynska as a modest bourgeoise setting out for a rural holiday, 10
and did full justice to the beauty of the Queen’s daughter Adelaide. 11
When Peter the Great came to Paris, Nattier made portraits of him and
his Czarina; Peter invited him to move to Russia; Nattier refused; Peter

Paris some Flemish realism, picturing people as they were; the elder
Mira- beau must have been alarmed to see himself as Aved saw him, 12 but
it is one of the great portraits of the century.</p>
<p>To all these gentlemen of the antechamber — even to Boucher and Char-
din — Grimm and Diderot preferred Carle Vanloo. He came of a long line
of pictorial Vanloos, of whom we know nine by name. Born at Nice in
1705, he was taken by his painter brother Jean Baptiste to Rome, where
he studied with both the chisel and the brush. At Paris he won the Prix
de Rome (1724); he spent another session in Italy, and returned to
France. He pleased the Academy, and angered Boucher, by following all
the academic rules. As he had never spared time from his art to learn
reading or writing, good manners or polite discourse, Pompadour shunned
him with a pretty shiver as a “bete a faire peur” — a “frightful beast”;
13 neverthe less she com- missioned him to paint A Spanish Conversation.
For a while he accepted the mood of the time, and pictured women dressed
in ideal contours; but he soon sobered down to an exemplary family life,
proud of his accom- plished wife and fond of his daughter Caroline. In
1753 he shared with Boucher in decorating the gorgeous Salle du Conseil
in the Palace of Fon- tainebleau. He climbed to such affectionate fame
that when he appeared in his seat at the Comedie-Frangaise after an
almost mortal illness, the entire audience rose and applauded, revealing
the close .relation of art and letters in that tensely cultural age.</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste Oudry recorded the royal hunts in engravings,
paintings, and tapestries. The Queen chose him as her teacher, and
marveled to watch him work. Some of his engravings provided excellent
guides for tapestry weavers; soon Oudry was appointed director of the
royal factory at Beau- vais. He found there nothing but chaos and
decadence; he reorganized the operations with a firm hand, infected the
workers with his enthusiasm, and designed for them a series of
tapestries illustrating with delectable animals the fables of La
Fontaine. There too he made the cartoon for the dazzling assemblage of
women and beasts that hangs in the Louvre as the Diana Portiere. The
weavers at Les Gobelins become jealous of these Beauvais successes; they
persuaded the King to transfer Oudry to the older factory; and there
Oudry wore himself out in a long struggle to have the weavers accept the
colors that he prescribed. Meanwhile he contributed, both in Beauvais
and in Paris, to train the varied talents of the most distinctive,
brilliant, and berated artist of mid-century France.</p>

<p>THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY</p>
<p>3*3</p>
<p>2 . Boucher: 1103-10</p>
<p>Listen to Diderot contemplating Boucher’s nudes:</p>
<p>What colors! what variety! what wealth of objects and ideas! This</p>
<p>man has all but truth. . . . The degradation of taste, of color, of
com- position, of character, of expression, has followed step by step
the de- basement of morals. . . . What should this man paint save what
he</p>
<p>conceives in his imagination? And what can he conceive who spends his
life in the company of women of the town? . . . This man takes</p>
<p>the brush only to show me buttocks and breasts. He knows not what
grace is. . . . Delicacy, honesty, innocence, and simplicity have
be-</p>
<p>come strangers to him. He has never seen nature for an instant; at
least not the nature which interests my soul, yours, that of any
wellborn</p>
<p>child, that of any woman who has feeling. He is without taste. . .
.</p>
<p>And it is at that moment, forsooth, that he is made first painter to
the King 〔1765〕. 14</p>
<p>Boucher presumably never saw this critique, since it was directed to
Grimm’s foreign clientele. Let us look at him without malice
aforethought.</p>
<p>He was a child of Paris, of its code and ways. His father was a
designer who kept an art shop near the Louvre, and taught Francis the
rudiments of painting and sculpture. As the boy showed a facile talent,
he was ap- prenticed to the engraver Laurent Cars, then to the painter
Fran5ois Le- moyne. Being engaged to paint scenery for the Opera, he
fell in with a succession of actresses and chorus girls; he imitated, so
far as his means allowed, all the dissipations of the Regency. 15 Once,
he tells us, he experi- enced an idyllic love for a pretty fruitiere,
Rosette; she seemed to him sim- plicity and purity incarnate; he took
her as model for a Madonna into which he poured all that remained of his
boyhood piety. But while this work was still unfinished he relapsed into
promiscuity. When he tried to finish it his inspiration had vanished,
and Rosette too. He never recaptured that moment of tender imagination.
16</p>
<p>His skill developed rapidly under the tutelage of Lemoyne. In
that</p>
<p>atelier he learned something of Correggio’s flair for femi nine
figures of classic features and supple grace. At the Luxembourg Palace
he studied the resplendent canvases in which Rubens had turned the life
of Marie de Medicis into an epic of color and noblesses de robes. In
1723, aged twenty, he won the Prix de Rome, entitling him to three
years’ board and lodging in Paris, a pension of three hundred livres,
and four years in Rome. We get a picture of student life in the Paris of
the Regency when we are told that his companions carried the victor on
their shoulders around the Place du Louvre.</p>
<p>3H</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XIn 1727 he accompanied Carle Vanloo to Italy. The director of
the</p>
<p>Academie Royale de France in Rome reported that he had found for “a
young man named Boucher … a little hole of a room, and I have packed him
in there. I am afraid it is really no more than a hole, but at least he
will be under cover.” 17 The “modest youth,” as the director described
him, did not always have to sleep there, for he found many beds open to
him in Rome. It is significant of changing taste that he showed no
liking for the work of Raphael or Michelangelo, but struck up a
friendship with Tiepolo.</p>
<p>Returning to Paris (1731), he continued to burn the candle at both
ends. He was seldom content with any but a firsthand knowledge of his
models. Nevertheless he found time to paint some outstanding pictures —
e.g., U En- levement d Europe ( The Rape of Europa ), one of his
countless expositions of the female form. In 1 7 3 3 he thought he had
discovered Venus herself in his model Jeanne Buseaux, and, though he
felt that “marriage is scarcely in my line,” 18 he took her as his wife.
He was briefly faithful to her, and she re - paid him in kind. Probably
she posed for his painting Renaud et Armide , 19 which won him full
membership in the Academie des Beaux- Arts (1734). Louis XV now
commissioned him to paint cheerful scenes in the bedroom of the still
loved Queen. With the reopening of the Salon in 1737 his work found
wider fame and patronage; thereafter he knew no poverty, and soon no
rival.</p>
<p>His specialty was nudes. Until his marriage he had seldom lingered
long enough with one woman to discover much more of her than her skin;
but he had found that surface endlessly interesting, and seemed resolved
to por- tray it in every nook and cranny, every form and pose, from hair
of blond silk to feet that never knew a shoe. Boucher was rococo in the
flesh.</p>
<p>But he was more than that. Though later critics condemned his art as
technically defective, he was actually a master craftsman in
composition, color, and line; however he sometimes scrimped his art in
hurry for a fee. Many contemporaries acclaimed the fresh plein-air
spirit of his pictures, the fertility of his imagination, the easy grace
of his line; and the hostile Dide- rot thought that “no one understands
as Boucher does the art of light and shade.” 20 Hardly any branch of
painting eluded his skill. Those of us who know only some of his
paintings and tapestries are surprised to learn that “the popularity of
Boucher was due as much to his drawings as to his paint - ings.” 21 His
drawings became precious items in his lifetime; illustrious collectors
competed for them; they were bought like easel pictures, and were hung
on bedroom or boudoir walls. They were marvels of economy — a dimple
made with a dot, a smile dashed off with a line, and all the sheen and
rustle of silken skirts emerging miraculously from a bit of chalk.</p>
<p>Surely not for the pelf involved, but because of the genius and
imagina- tion swelling in him, lighting his eyes, driving his hands,
Boucher worked</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY</p>
<p>315</p>
<p>ten hours a day in his studio, leaving his mark on almost everything
that he touched. Besides a thousand pictures, he painted fans, ostrich
eggs, pottery, medallions, screens, furniture, carriages, stage scenery,
the walls and ceiling of a theater; all alert Paris came to see the
decor he provided as background for Noverre’s ballet Les Fetes chinoises
(1754). He had only a minor inter - est in landscapes, being Aphrodite’s
ambassador to the Louvre; yet he en - shrined his human forms in woods
and fields, by sparkling waters or shady ruins, under white clouds in a
blue sky, and a warm sun abetting and ap- proving the heat of the blood.
One would have thought genre pictures quite uncongenial to him;
nevertheless he painted A Family Scene, and — as if to free himself from
the thralldom of beauty — he represented farm- yards, barns, dovecotes,
wheelbarrows, back-yard debris, donkeys ambling under a load of
clattering pans. To round out his repertoire he became the greatest
tapestry designer of the century.</p>
<p>In 1736 Oudry invited him to Beauvais to design for the weavers
there. He began with fourteen drawings of Italian village scenes; 22
they proved so successful that they were woven at least a dozen times
before his death. He proceeded to a more typical theme, The Story of
Psyche — five hang- ings modeled by Mme. Boucher; these tapestries are
among the choice mas- terpieces of eighteenth-century art. He crowned
his work with six tapes- tries called The Noble Pastoral ; 23 one of
these, The Bird Catchers ( La Pipee aux Oiseaux) shows as charming a
pair of lovers as ever evolved from silk or wool. Critics have
complained that with Oudry and Boucher tapestry became too much like
painting, and lost its distinguishing virtues. Louis XV hardly minded,
for when Oudry died (1755) he promoted</p>
<p>Boucher to head Les Gobelins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the triumphant artist had won the ardent patronage of Pom-
padour. For her he decorated the palace of Bellevue, and designed its
furni- ture. For the theater with which she strove to entertain the King
he painted the scenery and devised the costumes. He made several
portraits of her, so appealing in beauty and grace that all judgment
hesitates before them. The charge that Boucher never got beyond the
flesh is silenced here; he has made us see not so much the physical
charms of the mistress as the qualities of intelligence and tenderness
that endeared her to the King, the cultural in- terest that made her the
goddess of the philosophes, and the feminine artistry of dress that
daily clothed with new allure the body’s fading charms. Through these
portraits, and La Tour’s, she could quietly remind the King of the
beauty that was gone and the subtler bewitchments that remained.
Perhaps, too, she us ed Boucher’s sensual pictures to please the royal
lust. No wonder she made Boucher her favorite, secured him an apartment
in the Louvre, took lessons from him in engraving, discussed with him
her plans for decorating her palaces and promoting the arts. For her he
painted</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>X( 1 75 3) two °f his greatest pictures, Le Lever du Soleil ( Sunrise
) and Le Coucher du Soleil (Sunset) 24 — in both of which, of course,
the sun is out- shone by human forms.</p>
<p>He survived Pompadour, survived the disastrous war with England and
Frederick, and continued prosperous to the end of his sixty-seven years.
Commissions flowed in; he became wealthy, but worked as zealously as
ever, and he redeemed his wealth with generosity. He was now a benevo-
lent satyr, untiringly sensual, but ever gay and kind, “obliging and
disin - terested, . . . incapable of base jealousies, . . . immune from
any low appetite for money gains.” 25 He worked too fast to reach the
highest excel - lence; he indulged his imagination so freely that he
lost touch with reality. He told Reynolds that he needed no models, and
preferred to paint from memory, but his memory idealized. Uncorrected by
reality, he became careless in his drawing and exaggerated in color; he
almost invited the harsh criticisms that came upon him in his later
years. Grimm, Diderot, and others accused him of mistaking prettiness
for beauty, of reducing art from dignity to specious and superficial
decoration, and of lowering the moral tone of the time by idealizing
physical charms. Diderot denounced his “simperings, affectations, . . .
beauty spots, rouge, gewgaws, . . . frivo - lous women, libidinous
satyrs, bastard infants of Bacchus and Silenus.” 28 Dying at work in his
studio, Boucher left unfinished on his easel The Toi- lette of Venus —
as if to defy Diderot. And Diderot, hearing that the artist was dead,
had a twitch of remorse. “I have spoken, too much evil of</p>
<p>Boucher,” he said; “I retract.” 27 Let us leave the matter there.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Chardin: 1699-1119</li>
</ol>
<p>How different from Boucher’s was the world of Chardin— what a con-
trast in conceptions of beauty, in character and wit! Here was almost a
class war, a revolt of the middle-middle class against the wasteful
epicure- anism of the financiers, the aristocracy, and the court. Jean
Baptiste Simeon Chardin was born bourgeois, remained contentedly
bourgeois, and painted bourgeois life affectionately to the end. His
father was a master cabinet- maker, high in his guild, owner of a home
in the Rue de Seine on the Left Bank. Because he supposed that Jean
would succeed him in his trade, he gave him little schooling, much
manual training. Chardin later regretted this scantiness of education,
but it kept him from treading again the old tracks in art, and turned
his face and brush to the objects around him in the workshop and the
home. He liked to draw, and soon itched to paint. The father let him
enroll in the studio of Pierre Jacques Cazes, then a painter for the
court.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>The youth was unhappy there; the classical models he was told to copy
seemed absurdly remote from the life he knew. When a surgeon friend of
his father asked him to paint a sign proclaiming the barber- surgeon’s
trade and displaying its instruments, Jean, perhaps remembering
Watteau’s em - blem for Gersaint, painted a vast signboard showing a man
wounded in a duel, attended by a surgeon and assistant; but for good
measure Chardin added a water carrier, a constable, some night watchmen,
a carriage, a woman gazing from its window, a crowd of onlookers peering
over heads — and all in an eclat of bustle and gestures and excitement.
The surgeon was displeased, and proposed to discard the sign, but it won
so much attention and approval from passers-by that he let it remain
over his door. We hear no more of Chardin till in 1728 his paintings of
a fish ( La Rate) and a side- board with silver and fruit (Le Buffet )
drew special praise in an open-air exhibition in the Place Dauphine.
Some members of the Academy invited him to apply for membership; he
arranged to have a few of his paintings displayed there anonymously;
they were acclaimed as masterpieces, as- cribed to Flemings; he
confessed his authorship; he was reproved for the ruse, but was admitted
(1728).</p>
<p>In 1731 he became the fiance of Marguerite Sainctar, whose parents
promised a good dowry. During the engagement these parents suffered
heavy losses and died, leaving Marguerite penniless; Chardin married her
nevertheless. Chardin pere gave them rooms on the third floor of a house
that he had recently bought at the corner of the Rue du Four and the Rue
Princesse. There the artist pitched his studio, which was also his
kitchen; for he had now definitely chosen to paint still life and genre.
The vegeta- bles, fruit, fish, bread, and meat that littered the room
became in turn the models for his brush and the menu of his meals.</p>
<p>Chardin was charmed by the changing shapes and colors of ordinary
things. He saw in them qualities of texture and light rarely noticed by
in- curious eyes. The cheeks of an apple were to him as romantic as a
maiden’s blush, and the gleam of a knife on the green of a tablecloth
challenged him to catch it in its flight and fix it in his art. He
rendered these lowly objects with such fidelity and insight, such
mastery of color and contour, light and shade, as few painters have
displayed. We look at these natures mortes and perceive that they are
alive, that we never saw them properly before, never realized the
complexity and uniqueness of their forms, nor the nuances of their
tints. Chardin found poetry not only in a vase of flowers or a cluster
of grapes, but in an old worn caldron, a nut, an orange rind, a
crumbling crust of bread. There had always been poetry in them, as the
Flemish and the Dutch had known; but who in the France of Boucher and
Pompadour had ever suspected it? The beauty of these objects, of course,
was in the eye of the beholder, or rather in his soul; it was Chardin’s
intense feeling,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>318</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xas well as his intent vision — and his poverty — that made a lyric
of the larder, an epic of a menu.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the story — or legend? — of how he was prodded into
painting human forms. One day he heard his friend Aved refuse a com-
mission of four hundred livres to paint a portrait; Chardin, accustomed
to small fees, marveled at the refusal; Aved answered, “You think a
portrait is as easy to paint as a sausage?” 28 It was a cruel jibe, but
useful; Chardin had confined his subjects too narrowly, and would soon
have satiated his clients with dishes and food. He resolved to paint
figures, and discovered in him- self a genius of sympathetic portrayal
that he had allowed to sleep. Meeting the challenge head on, he painted
a portrait of Aved himself as Le Souffleur (The Blower ). 29 He bettered
this with Le Chateau de Cartes ( The House of Cards) ; but here too the
excellence was in the clothing rather than the face. In V Enfant au
Toton (The Child with a Top) Chardin struck his</p>
<p>second stride: the hands a bit awkward, but the face revealing a
sympa- thetic understanding. This tender empathy found outlets in his
pictures of girls, as in the two masterpieces in the Rothschild
Collection: a girl playing badminton, another “amusing herself with her
luncheon.”</p>
<p>In women Chardin saw not the rosy lures that had aroused Boucher but
the wifely and maternal virtues that made the family the prop and savior
of the state. With Chardin the middle-class woman entered French art,
and had her due. He knew her and loved her in all her engaging services:
bringing food from the market, drawing water, peeling turnips, winding
wool, caring for the sick, warning the schoolboy against truancy, or (in
the most famous of Chardin’s picture s, Le Benedicite 30 ) holding up
the meal until the youngest daughter, with little hands joined, has
murmured grace. He saw woman always in her house dress, without frills,
never idle, serving her husband or her children from dawn and the
morning prayers till they are all safely tucked in bed. Through Chardin
we see a Paris saner than the court, still clinging to the old morality,
and to the religious faith that gave it a mystical support. It is the
most wholesome art in all of art’s history.</p>
<p>These now universally acclaimed pictures found a very limited market,
and brought Chardin just enough francs to maintain him in contented sim-
plicity. He could not haggle with customers; he let his pictures go for
al- most any offered fee; and as he worked slowly and laboriously, he
wore himself out in relative poverty, while Boucher used himself up in
affluence. When his first wife died, after only four years of marriage,
he let his rooms and affairs fall into a baccalaureate disorder. His
friends prevailed upon him to remarry, if only to have a woman’s deft
and patient hand restore some order to his menage. He hesitated for nine
years, then took to wife the widow Marguerite Pouget, in literally a
marriage of convenience. She brought him a moderate dowry, including a
house that she owned at 13</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF BEAUTY</p>
<p>Rue Princesse. He moved into it, and his poverty ended. She was a
good woman and a solicitous wife. He learned to love her gratefully.</p>
<p>To further finance him the King gave him (1752) a pension of five
hun- dred livres, and the Academy (1754) appointed him its treasurer.
Soon afterward it engaged him to place the pictures submitted to its
Salons; he was thoroughly unsuited to this task, but his wife helped
him. In 1756 a friendly engraver, Charles Nicolas Cochin II, persuaded
Marigny to give Chardin a comfortable apartment in the Louvre. It was
this same Cochin who, anxious to draw Chardin away from culinary
repetitions, secured for him a commission to paint three dessus-de-porte
pictures — to be placed “over the door”— for some rooms in Marigny’s
chateau. Chardin laboriously produced (1765) Attributs des Arts,
Attributs des Sciences, and Attributs de la Musique . 31 A further
commission resulted in two similar tableaux for Pompadour’s palace of
Bellevue. Unfortunately the five thousand livres pledged for these five
pictures were not paid till 1771.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the aging artist was losing his skill. In 1767 Diderot, who
in 1759 ha d hailed his work as the soul of “nature and truth,” said
sadly, “Chardin is an excellent genre painter, but he is passing.” 32 La
Tour’s pas - tels were capturing the fancy of Paris. In a burst of
rivalry Chardin himself took chalk and paper, and astonished La Tour by
turning out two pastel portraits of himself which are among the most
arresting and most finished products in the Louvre. One showed him with
an old double-knotted coif on his head, spectacles crowning the end of
his nose, cravat wound warmly about his neck; the other revealed the
same garb, the same face full of wonder and character, plus a visor to
shade his ailing eyes. Still more re- markable was the pastel portrait
that he made of his second wife, now sixty-eight years old, a lovely and
kindly face, drawn with skill and love. This is the picture that we
would choose as the chef- d’oeuvre of Chardin.</p>
<p>It was a triumphant close to a unique and honorable life. We need not
picture Chardin as a man immune to human faults; indeed, he too, pierced
by the nettles of life and jealousy, could react with touching choler
and prickly speech. But when he died (1779) not a soul in the envious,
slander- ous world of Parisian art and wit could find a hostile word to
say of him. Even that decaying regime seemed to realize that Chardin had
revealed, with a technique that none surpassed in his time, the France
that was the real and still healthy France, that hidden world of simple
labor and family loyalty that would survive — and would enable France to
survive — a century of chaos and revolution. He was, said Diderot, “the
greatest magician that we have had.” 33</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>X4 . La Tour: 1104-88</p>
<p>The veering vanes of taste today award the palm for
eighteenth-century French painting not to Boucher, nor to Chardin, but
to Maurice Quentin de La Tour. As a “character” he is the most
interesting of the three, for he mingled his vices and virtues with
impish insouciance, drove the whole cowering world into a corner, and,
like Diogenes, told a king to get out of his way. He was a moneygrubber
of consummate rapacity, bumptious, im- pudent, arrogant; a bitter enemy
and incalculable friend, as vain as an old man concealing or boasting
his years. He was an honest, straightforward curmudgeon, a lavish
philanthropist, a genial boor, a fire-eating patriot, a scorner of
titles, refusing a royal offer of nobility. But all this is irrelevant;
he was the greatest draftsman of his time, and the greatest pastel
painter in the history of France.</p>
<p>Louis XV, sitting to La Tour for a portrait, was piqued by his
frequent praise of foreigners. “I thought you were a Frenchman,” said
the King. “No, Sire,” answered the artist, “I am a Picard, from Saint -
Quentin.” 34 He was born there to a prosperous musician, who proposed to
make him an engineer. The boy preferred to draw pictures; the father
reproved him; Maurice, aged fifteen, fled to Paris, then to Reims, then
to Cambrai, paint- ing portraits here and there. At Cambrai an English
diplomat invited him to London as his guest. Maurice went, made money
and merry, returned to Paris, and posed as an English painter. Rosalba
Camera was in Paris in 1721; her pastel portraits were sought for by
every notable from the Re- gent to the newest nouveau riche. La Tour
found that such drawing with colored crayons suited his hectic
temperament better than the patient elaboration of oil. Through years of
trial and error he learned to achieve with chalk such shades and
subtleties of color and expression as no other portraitist of the time
could match.</p>
<p>When he exhibited some of his portrayals in the Salon of 1737 the oil
painters began to fear this crayon competition. His three pastels were
the talk of the Salon of 1 740; his portrait of President de Rieux, in
the black robe and red gown of a magistrate, was the triumph of the
Salon of 1741; his portrait of the Turkish ambassador was besieged with
admiring specta- tors in 1742. Soon all the fashionable world demanded
transfiguration into chalk. La Tour’s encounter with the King became
historic. The artist be - gan by objecting to the room chosen, which
admitted light from every side. “What do you expect me to do in this
lantern?” grumbled La Tour. “I particularly chose this sequestered
room,” replied the King, “so that we should not be interrupted.” “I did
not know, Sire,” said La Tour, “that you were not the m aster in your
own house.” On another occasion he expressed</p>

<p>regret that France had no adequate fleet; the King slyly countered,
“And what about Vernet?”— who was painting seascapes crowded with ships.
33 When La Tour found the Dauphin misinformed on some affair, La Tour
told him blandly, “You see how easily people of your kind allow your -
selves to be taken in by swindlers.” 36</p>
<p>Despite his distressing candor, the Academy in 1 746 admitted him to
full membership — which was a certificate of mastery. But in 1749,
prodded by the oil painters, it resolved to accept no more works in
pastel. In 1753 a painter complained that “M. de La Tour has so
developed the art of pastel that he may provoke a distaste f or oil
painting.” 37 La Tour fought back with invectives and chef-
d’oeuvres.</p>
<p>He had a rival in pastel; Jean Baptiste Perronneau was preferred
by</p>
<p>Lemoyne, Oudry, and other Academicians. La Tour asked him to paint a
portrait of La Tour; Perronneau complied and produced a masterpiece. La
Tour paid him handsomely, but then painted himself in one of the most
revealing self-portraits known. He arranged with Chardin to have the two
portraits exhibited side by side in the Salon of 1751. Everyone agreed
that the autoritratto excelled Perronneau’s portrait. La Tour’s La Tour
still smiles in victory in the Louvre.</p>
<p>There, too, is the portrait with which he challenged Boucher — the
one pas- tel that he exhibited in 1755. He almost lost the opportunity.
When an invitation came to paint the most famous woman of the reign, he
replied, “Kindly inform Madame de Pompadour that I do not go out to
paint.” It was his way of luring fortune by retreat. His friends begged
him to yield; he sent word that he would come, but on condition that no
one should interrupt the sitting. Arriving, he removed his gaiters,
unbuckled his shoes, discarded his wig and his collar, covered his head
with a taffeta cap, and began to paint. Suddenly the door opened; the
King entered. La Tour pro- tested, “You gave me your promise, madame,
that your door would remain closed.” The King laughed, and begged him to
resume work. La Tour re - fused. “It is impossible for me to obey your
Majesty. I shall return w hen Madame is alone. … I do not like to be
interrupted.” The King with -</p>
<p>drew, and La Tour completed the sitting.</p>
<p>Of the two most famous portraits of Pompadour, La Tour’s is pro -</p>
<p>founder than Boucher’s; less brilliant in color, less exquisite in
fini sh and de- tail, but more mature in expression and interpretation.
La Tour pictured the Marquise, doubtless at her own suggestion, as the
patroness of art, music, letters, and philosophy. On a nearby sofa a
guitar; in her hand some sheets of music; on the table a globe, a
portfolio of her own engravings, Voltaire’s Henriade, Montesquieu’s
Esprit des lois, and Volume IV of Diderot’s En - cyclopedic.</p>
<p>When La Tour had finished the portrait he asked for a fee of
48,000</p>
<p>322</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xlivres. Madame, extravagant though she was, thought this a bit de
trop; she sent him 24,000 livres in gold. La Tour proposed to send the
money back. Chardin asked him whether he knew the cost of the paintings
in Notre- Dame, which included masterpieces by Le Brun and Le Sueur.
“No,” La Tour admitted. Chardin calculated their total cost at 1 2,600
livres. La Tour, readjusting his perspective, accepted the 24,000
livres. In general he charged for his portraits according to the wealth
of the sitters; if they objected he sent them away unportrayed. Probably
he made exceptions for Voltaire, Rousseau, and d’Alembert, for he warmly
admired the philosophes, and frankly avowed his own loss of religious
belief.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of his high fees he was in universal demand. Through
him we know the leading personalities of the age; he became a pantheon
in pastel. He drew lovely portraits of the Queen, of the young Dauphin
and the demure Dauphine, 38 and of La Camargo, prima ballerina; he
managed to make Rousseau look amiable and sane; 39 in one of his finest
works he pic- tured Maurice de Saxe, the handsome victor over armies and
women; 40 he caught the full fire of life in the eyes of his friend the
painter Jean Res - tout; 41 and he dressed himself in silk and lace and
wig for the self-portrait that now hangs in Amiens. Despite his rough
manners, his lawless caprices, and his unpredictable moods he was
welcomed in aristocratic homes, in M. de La Popeliniere’s circle at
Passy, in Mme. Geoffrin’s salon. He was on terms of friendship with the
leading writers of his time, even with the painters and sculptors who
envied his success — Vanloo, Chardin, Greuze, Pigalle, Pajou. The King
gave him a superfluous pension, and a lodging in the Louvre. The man
must have been lovable after all.</p>
<p>He never married, but he did not scatter his seed as widely as
Boucher. He had a mistress, Mile. Fel, whose singing helped to make the
success of Rousseau’s opera Le Devin du village; Grimm sickened with
unrequited love for her, but she gave herself wholeheartedly to La Tour.
He remem- bered her accommodations so gratefully that in his eightieth
year he still drank to her memory. Her devotion was one of his
consolations when age stiffened his fingers and dulled his eyes. He paid
for the hybris of his zenith with the long humiliation of his decline;
he outlived his genius, and had to hear critics speak of it as dead.</p>
<p>Nearing eighty, he left his apartment in the Louvre to live in the
fresher air of Auteuil; and finally he returned to the city of his
birth. St.-Quentin received the prodigal son with salvos of gunfire,
ringing of bells, and popu- lar acclaim. In that quiet town he lived
four years more, his proud reason fading into a mild and harmless
insanity, mumbling a pantheistic philos- ophy, praying to God and the
sun, and dreaming hopefully of revolution. He died a year before its
coming, kissing the hands of his servants in his final agony.</p>
