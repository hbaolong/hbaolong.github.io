<h4 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>The Classic Zenith in French</p>
<p>Literature</p>
<p>1643-1715</p>
<p>I. MILIEU</p>
<p>T HE zenith in French classical literature was not coterminous with
the age of Louis XIV ; it came, rather, under the ministry of Mazarin
and in the halcyon youth of the reign (1661-67), before Mars had sent
the Muses to the rear. The initial stimulus to the literary outburst was
given by Richelieu’s encouragement of drama and poetry; the second spur
came from the martial triumphs at Rocroi (1643) ar, d Lens (1648); the
third flowed from the diplomatic victories of France in the treaties of
Westphalia (1648) and the Pyrenees (1659); the fourth, from the
association of men of letters with men of breeding and women of culture
in the salons; only the final impulse was the patronage of literature by
the King and the court. Many of the literary masterpieces of the reign —
Pascal’s Letters (1656) and Thoughts, Moliere’s Tartuffe (1664), Le
Festin de pierre (1665), and Le Misanthrope (1666), La Roch efoucauld’s
Maxims (1665), Boileau’s Satires (1667), Racine’s Andromaque (1667) —
were written before 1667 by men who had grown up under Richelieu and
Mazarin.</p>
<p>It remains nevertheless that Louis was the most lavish patron of
literature in all history. Hardly two years after taking over the
government (1662-</p>
<ol start="63" type="1">
<li>— consequently before all but two of the works just mentioned — he
asked Colbert and others to have competent persons draw up a list of
authors, scholars, and scientists, of whatever land, who merited aid.
From these lists forty-five Frenchmen and fifteen foreigners received
royal pensions . 1 The Dutch scholars Heinsius and Vossius, the Dutch
physicist Christian Huygens, the Florentine mathematician Viviani, and
many other foreigners were surprised to receive letters from Colbert
apprising them that they had been voted pensions by the French King,
subject to approval by their own governments. Some of these pensions ran
as high as three thousand livres per year. Boileau, the unofficial
president of poetry, lived on his pensions like a grand seigneur, and
left 286,000 francs in cash; Racine received 145,000 francs over a
period of ten years as royal historian . 8 Probably the international
pensions were motived in part by the wish to</li>
</ol>
<p>I2 9</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>have a favorable press abroad; and the domestic gifts aimed to bring
thought, like industry and art, under governmental co-ordination and
con- trol. This aim was achieved: all publication was subjected to state
censor- ship, and the French mind submitted, with only sporadic and
negligible resistance, to royal supervision of its printed expression.
Moreover, the King was persuaded that these pensioned pens would sing
his praises in prose and verse and send a rosy picture of him down to
history. They did their best.</p>
<p>Louis not only pensioned men of letters, he protected and respected
them, raised their social status, and welcomed them at cour t.
“Remember,” he said to Boileau, “that I shall always have a half hour to
give you.” 3 His literary taste may have leaned too far toward classical
order, dignity, and good form; but these virtues seemed to him not only
to stabilize government but to ennoble France. In some ways he was ahead
of the people and the court in his literary judgments. We have seen him
protecting Moliere against noble and ecclesiastical sniping; we shall
see him encouraging the highest flights of Racine.</p>
<p>Again at the suggestion of Colbert, and again following in the steps
of Richelieu, Louis declared himself the personal protector of the
French Academy, raised it to the rank of a major state institution,
provided it with ample funds, and gave it lodgings in the Louvre.
Colbert himself became a member. When an Academician who was also a
grand seigneur had an easy chair installed in the Academy for his own
comfort, Colbert sent for thirty-nine more such seats to maintain an
equality of dignity above di stinctions of class; so “ les quarante
fauteuils ” became a synonym for the Academie Frangaise. In 1663 a
subsidiary Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres was organized to
record the events of the reign.</p>
<p>Colbert saw to it that the forty Immortals earned their keep by
dutiful attendance, and by work on the Dictionary. This undertaking,
begun in 1638, was progressing so slowly that Boisrobert could express
alphabetically his longing for longevity:</p>
<p>Six months they’ve been engaged on F;</p>
<p>Oh, that my fate would guarantee</p>
<p>That I should keep alive till G. 4</p>
<p>The plan of the Dictionary was elaborate: it proposed to trace
each</p>
<p>permissible word through the history of its uses and spellings, with
abundant illustrative quotations; so fifty-six years elapsed between its
inception and its first publication (1694). It screened too strictly the
language of the people, the professions, and the arts; it pruned
Rabelais, Amyot, and Montaigne; it outlawed a thousand expressions that
favored vivid speech.</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 131</p>
<p>The same logic, precision, and clarity that made geometry the ideal
of seventeenth-century science and philosophy, the same authority and
discipline by which Colbert ruled the economy and Le Brun the arts, the
same dignity and refinement that governed the court of the King, the
same classic cleaving to rules that molded the style of Bossuet,
Fenelon, La Rochefoucauld, Racine, and Boileau — these dictated the
Dictionary of the Academy. Periodically it has been revised and
reissued, struggling to main- tain order in a living growth, its
classical citadel repeatedly assaulted, and often conquered, by the
errors of the people, the terminology of the sciences, the jargon of the
trades, the argot of the streets; a dictionary, like history and
government, is a composition of forces between the weight of the many
and the power of the few. Something was lost to the language in
vitality, much was gained in purity, precision, elegance, and prestige.
It produced no turbulent and wanton Shakespeare, but it became the most
respected language in Europe, the medium of diplomacy, the speech of
aristocracies. For a century and more, Europe aspired to be French.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CORNEILLE POSTSCRIPT: 1 643-84</li>
</ol>
<p>The langu age reached its zenith in the flexible facility of
Moliere’s</p>
<p>dialogue, in the sonorous rhetoric of Corneille, and in the melodious
re- finement of Racine.</p>
<p>Corneille was apparently in his prime — aged thirty-seven — when
Louis became King. He began the reign with Le Menteur, which raised the
tone of French comedy as Le Cid had raised that of tragedy. Thereafter
he staged tragedies almost annually: Rodogune (1644), Theodore (1645),
Heraclius (1646), Don Sancho d’ Aragon (1649) , Andromede (1650),</p>
<p>Nicomede (1651), Pertharite (1652). A few were well received, but, as
each trod on its predecessor’s heels, it became evident that Corneille
was working too hastily, and that the sap of his genius was running
thin. His flair for portraying nobility was lost in a river of argument;
his eloquence defeated itself by continuance. “My friend Corneille,”
said Moliere, “has a familiar who inspires him with the finest verses in
the world. But sometimes the familiar leaves him to shift for himself,
and then he fares very badly.” 5 Pertharite was so unfavorably received
that Corneille for six years retired from the theater (1653-59). He
dealt with his critics in a series of Examens, and in three Discours on
dramatic poetry; these showed his critical faculty rising as his poetic
talent fell; they became a fountainhead of modern literary criticism,
and served as models when Dryden defended his middling poetry in
excellent prose.</p>
<p>In 1659 a thoughtful gift from Fouquet called Corneille back to
the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>» 3 *</p>
<p>boards. Oedipe won some acclaim in the wake of the young King’s
praise; but the works that followed — Sertorius (1662), Sophonisbe
(1663), Othon (1664), Agesilas (1666), Attila (1667) — were so mediocre
that Fontenelle could hardly believe that they were by Corneille; and
Boileau emitted a cruel epigram: “ Apres /’Agesilas, betas! Mais apres
/’Attila, bola! — After Agesilas, alas! But after Atti la, stop!” Madame
Henrietta, usually the soul of kindness, made matters worse by inviting
both Corneille and Racine, each with the knowledge of the other, to
write a play on the same theme — Berenice, the Jewish princess with whom
the future Emperor Titus fell in love. Racine’s Berenice was played at
the Hotel de Bourgogne on November 21, 1670, almost five months after
Henrietta’s death, and met with full success; Corneille’s Tite et
Berenice was performed a week later by</p>
<p>Moliere’s company, and was coldly received. The failure broke
Corneille’s spirit. He tried again with Pulcherie (1672) and Surena
(1674); they too failed; and Corneille spent the remaining decade of his
life in quiet and somber piety.</p>
<p>He was so careless of money that, despite a pension of two thousand
livres and other gifts from Louis XIV, he ended his life in poverty.
Through some oversight the pension was interrupted for four years; then
Corneille appealed to Colbert, who had it restored; but after the death
of Colbert it lapsed again. Boileau, hearing of it, informed Louis XIV,
and offered to give up his own pension in favor of Corneille. The King
immediately sent two hundred livres to the old poet, who soon thereafter
died (1684), aged seventy-eight. A eulogy memorable for generosity and
eloquence was pronounced upon him in the French Academy by the rival who
had</p>
<p>succeeded him, and who had already raised French drama and poetry to
the peak of their history.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>racine: 1639-99</li>
</ol>
<p>Like Moliere, he was of middle-class origin. His father was
controller of the state’s salt monopoly at La Ferte -Milon, some fifty
miles northeast of Paris; his mother was the daughter of an attorney at
Villers-Cotterets. She died in 1641, when Jean was not yet two; his
father died a year later; and the boy was brought up by his paternal
grandparents. There was a strong Jansenist bent in the family; a
grandmother and an aunt joined the Port- Royal sisterhood, and Jean
himself, at the age of sixteen, was sent to the petite ecole kept there
by the Solitaries. He received from them an</p>
<p>intensive training in religion and Greek — two influences that were
to take turns in dominating his life. He was fascinated by the plays of
Sophocles and Euripides, and translated some of them himself. At the
College</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 133</p>
<p>cTHarcourt in Paris he learned some philosophy and more classical
lore, and discovered the mysterious charms of young womanhood, new and
used. For two years he lived on the Quai des Grands- Augustins with his
cousin Nicolas Vitart, who fluctuated between Port-Royal and the
theater. Racine heard several plays, wrote one, and presented it to
Moliere. It was not good enough for production, but Moliere gave him a
hundred louis nevertheless, and encouraged him to try again. Racine
decided upon a literary career.</p>
<p>Alarmed by this madness, and by reports of his amours, his relatives
sent him to Uzes in south France (1659) as understudy to an uncle who,
as canon of the cathedral, promised him an ecclesiastical benefice if he
would study theology and be ordained. For a year the young poet, still
simmering with Paris, covered his fire with a black robe, and read
St. Thomas Aquinas — with a little Ariosto and Euripides on the side.
Now he wrote to La Fontaine:</p>
<p>All the women are brilliant . . . corpus solidum et sued plenum
〔flesh firm and succulent〕; but as the first thing that was said to me
was to be on my guard, I do not wish to say more about them. Besides,
it</p>
<p>would be profaning the house of a beneficed priest, in which I live,
to make a long discourse on the matter; domus mea domus or ationis 〔my
house is the house of prayer〕, … I was told, “Be blind.” If I can’t
be</p>
<p>that entirely, I can at least be mute; for . . . one must be a monk
with monks, just as I was a wolf with you and the other wolves of
your</p>
<p>pack. 0</p>
<p>The canon fell into difficulties, the promised benefice became
uncertain, Racine discovered that he had no vocation to the priesthood.
He changed his garb, closed the Srnmna, and returned to Paris
(1663).</p>
<p>Arrived, he published an ode that drew a hundred louis from the royal
purse. Moliere suggested to him a theme which Racine turned into his
second play, La Thebaide . Moliere produced it on June 20, 1664, but had
to withdraw it after four performances. However, it made enough noise to
be heard at Port-Royal-des-Champs. His nun aunt sent him thence a letter
that deserves to be quoted as part of a drama as eloquent and touch- ing
as anything in Racine:</p>
<p>Having learned that you are planning to come here, I have asked</p>
<p>of our Mother permission to see you. . . . But I have heard news,
these last days, that has moved me deeply. I write to you in the
bitterness of my heart, shedding tears that I should wish to lay in
abundance</p>
<p>before God to obtain from him your salvation, which is what I
long</p>
<p>for with more ardor than anything else in the world. I have
learned</p>
<p>»34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>with sorrow that you frequent, more than ever, people whose name is
an abomination to all who have any measure of piety, and with</p>
<p>reason, since they are forbidden entry to the church, or access to
the Sacrament. . . . Judge, then, my dear nephew, in what state I
must</p>
<p>be, for you must know the tenderness I have always had for you, and
that I have asked for nothing except that you should belong to God</p>
<p>in some honorable employment. I beg you, then, my dear nephew,</p>
<p>to have pity on your soul, to look into your heart and consider</p>
<p>seriously into what an abyss you have cast yourself. I hope that</p>
<p>what has been told me is not true; but if you are so unfortunate
as</p>
<p>to be continuing a commerce which dishonors you before God and</p>
<p>men, you must not think of coming to see us, for you well understand
that I could not speak with you, knowing you to be in a state so</p>
<p>deplorable and so contrary to Christianity. Meanwhile I shall not</p>
<p>cease to pray God to have mercy upon you and thereby upon me,</p>
<p>since your salvation is so dear to me. 7</p>
<p>Here is quite another world than that which our pages usually record
— a world of profound belief in the Christian creed, and of loving
devotion to its moral code. We cannot but sympathize with a woman who
could write with such sincerity of feeling, and not without excuse in
her view of the French drama as it had been in her youth. Not quite so
tender was a public statement by Nicole, who had taught Racine at
Port-Royal:</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this gentlemen has written . . . stage plays. . .
.</p>
<p>In the eyes of right-minded people such an occupation is in
itself</p>
<p>not a very honorable one; but, viewed in the light of the
Christian</p>
<p>religion and the Gospel teaching, it becomes really a dreadful
one.</p>
<p>Novelists and dramatists are poison- mongers who destroy not men’s
bodies but their souls. 8</p>
<p>Corneille, Moliere, and Racine separately answered this indictment,
Racine with an angry vigor that he keenly repented in later years.</p>
<p>His break with Port-Royal was soon followed by a break with Moliere.
On December 4, 1665, Moliere’s company presented Racine’s third play,
Alexandre. Moli&amp;re was characteristically generous; he knew that
Racine did not admire him as a tragic actor, and that the young author
was in love with the most beautiful but not the most capable of his
actresses; he kept himself and the Bejarts out of the cast, gave the
leading female role to Ther&amp;se du Parc, and spared no expense on the
production. It met with a good reception, but Racine was dissatisfied
with the acting. He arranged a private performance of his play by the
Troupe Royale; he was so pleased that he withdrew it from Moli&amp;re
and gave it to this rival company. He persuaded Mile, du Parc, who had
become his mistress, to leave Moliere’s</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 135</p>
<p>company and join the older one. In its new home at the Hotel de
Bourgogne the play ran through thirty performances in little more than
two months. It was not one of Racine’s masterpieces, but it established
him as the successor of Corneille, and won him the guiding friendship of
the critic Boileau. When Racine boasted, “I have a surprising facility
in writing my verses,” Boileau replied, “I want to teach you to write
them with dif - ficulty .” 9 Henceforth the great critic taught the poet
the rules of classic art.</p>
<p>We do not know with what difficulty Racine wrote Andromaque; in any
case he reached in it the full perfection of his dramatic power and
poetic style. Its dedication to Madame Henrietta recalls that he read
the play to her, and that she wept. Yet it is a drama of terror rather
than of sentiment, with all the inevitable catastrophe that we expect in
Aeschylus or Sophocles. The plot is a tangle of loves. Orestes loves
Hermione, who loves Pyrrhus, who loves Andromache, who loves Hector, who
is dead. Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, has been awarded three prizes for his
share in the Greek victory over Troy: Epirus as his kingdom, Andromache
(Hector’s widow) as his captive, and Hermione (daughter of Menelaus and
Helen) as his wife. Andromache is still young and beautiful, though
always in tears; she lives only to remember her noble husband, and to
fear for their child Astyanax, whom Racine, by dramatic license, rescues
from the death allotted him in Euripides to use him. here as a hinge of
fate. Orestes, son and slayer of Clytemnestra, comes to Epirus as envoy
of the Greeks to. demand of Pyrrhus the surrender and death of Astyanax
as a possible future avenger of Troy. Pyrrhus rejects the proposal in a
passage of untranslatable music:</p>
<p>On craint qu’avec Hector Troie un jour ne renaisse ,</p>
<p>Son fils peut me ravir le jour que je lui laisse.</p>
<p>Seigneur, tant de prudence entraine trop de soin:</p>
<p>Je ne sais point prevoir les malheurs de si loin.</p>
<p>Je songe quelle etait autrefois cette ville,</p>
<p>Si superbe en ramparts, en heros si fertile,</p>
<p>Maitresse de I’Asie; et je regarde enfin</p>
<p>Quel fut le sort de Troie et quel est son destin.</p>
<p>Je ne vois que des tours que la cendre a couvertes,</p>
<p>Un fieuve teint de sang, des campagnes desertes,</p>
<p>Un enfant dans les fers; et je ne puis songer</p>
<p>Que Troie en cet hat aspire i se venger.</p>
<p>Ah! si du fils d’ Hector la perte etait juree,</p>
<p>Pourquoi d’un an entier Vavons-nous differee?</p>
<p>Dans le sein de Priam ria-t-on pu Pimmoler?</p>
<p>Sous tant de morts, sous Troie il fallait Paccabler.</p>
<p>Tout halt juste alors: la vieillesse et Venfance</p>
<p>En vain sur leur faiblesse appuyaient leur defense;</p>

<p>There is one defect here: Pyrrhus, and perhaps Racine, do not
recognize how much the conqueror’s pity owes to the fact that he has
fallen in love with the child’s mother — even to offering to marry her
(whom he might have made his slave), and to adopt Astyanax as his son
and heir. She refuses him; she cannot forget Hector, whom Pyrrhus’
father killed. He threatens to abandon the child to the Greeks, and,
terrified, she consents to marriage. But Hermione — as powerful a
conception as Lady Macbeth — burns with anger at being cast aside; while
still loving Pyrrhus, she resolves to kill him; she accepts Orestes’
proffered devotion, on condition that he shall slay Pyrrhus. Reluctantly
he agrees. At every step and in every</p>
<p>character of this drama there is a conflict of motives mounting to a
psy- chological complex as subtle as any in literature. Greek soldiers,
violating sanctuary, kill Pyrrhus at the altar where he is exchanging
marriage vows with Andromache. Hermione scorns Orestes, runs to the
altar, plunges a knife into the dead Pyrrhus, stabs herself, and dies.
This is Racine’s greatest play, worthy to stand comparison with
Shakespeare or Euripides: a plot well constructed, characters revealed
in depth, feelings studied in their full complexity and intensity, + and
poetry of such splendor and harmony as France had not heard since
Ronsard.</p>
<p>Andromaque was at once recognized as a masterpiece, establishing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“They fear that Hector and Trov may one day be reborn; that his
son may take from me the life that in him I have spared. Sir, so much
foresight is too cautious; I cannot see evils at so great a distance. I
think what Troy used to be -so proud within its ramparts, so fertile in
heroes, mistress of Hither Asia; and then I behold its fate and destiny.
I see nothing but towers covered with sand, a river colored with blood,
fields deserted, a child in chains; and I cannot imagine that Troy in
this condition aspires to revenge. Ah, if the death of Hector’s son had
been promised, why have deferred it an entire year? Could we not have
immolated him on the breast of Priam? He might have been crushed under
Troy amid a thousand deaths. All might have been allowable then; old age
and infancy would in vain have sought in their weakness their defense;
victory and might, more cruel than ourselves, would have excited us to
murder in the confusion of our blows. Mv fury against the vanquished was
only too severe. But should my cruelty survive my wrath? Should I
leisurely bathe in the blood of a child despite the pity that I feel
rising in me? No, sir, let the Greeks seek another prey, let them pursue
elsewhere the relics of Troy; the course of my enmity is run. Epirus
will save that which Troy ha s preserved.”</p></li>

<p>Racine as the successor, and perhaps the superior, of Corneille. He
entered now his happiest decade, passing from one triumph to another,
and even challenging Moliere with a comedy. Les Plaidews (1668), a
burlesque on greedy lawyers, false witnesses, and corrupt judges, echoed
Racine’s own experience of the law. He had solicited and obtained a lien
on the income of a priory; his claim was disputed by a monk; a long
lawsuit followed, which so disgusted Racine that he abandoned the case,
and avenged himself with the play. It did not please its first audience;
but when it was shown at court Louis XIV laughed so heartily at its
sallies that the public changed its mind; and this mediocre comedy
played its part in filling Racine’s purse.</p>
<p>One minor note intervened. On December n, 1668, his mistress Mile, du
Parc died in mysterious circumstances — of which more later on. After
due delay he took another actress, Marie Champmesle. She had an
attentive husband but a bewitching voice; Racine eluded the one and
surrendered to the other. The liaison lasted from Berenice to Phedre ,
after which, as a wit expressed it, the lady was deracinee — torn from
the root — by the Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre.</p>
<p>Racine thought that Britannicus (1669) was his most careful work; and
like Phedre and Athalie it is often ranked above Andromaque. The modern
reader, even if steeped in Tacitus, will likely find it distasteful: a
termagant Agrippina, a whining Britannicus, a floundering Burrhus, a
slimy Narcissus, a Nero all evil — no character here shows us complexity
or development, none offers us that strain of nobility which should
somewhere redeem any tragedy worthy of a poet’s pen.</p>
<p>As Britannicus looked into Tacitus’ chamber of horrors, so
Berenice</p>
<ol start="1670" type="1">
<li>took an emperor’s love story from a compact line in Suetonius:
Berenicem statim ab urbe demisit invitus invitam 12 — “He, unwillingly,
at once sent the unwilling Berenice from the city.” Titus, besieging
Jerusalem (A.D. 70), had fallen in love with the Jewish princess. Though
already thrice married, she follows him to Rome as his mistress; but
when he inherits the throne he realizes that the Empire would not
tolerate an alien queen, and he dismisses her in a royal burst of common
sense. The play was warm with sentiment, and succeeded well with both
the public and the King, who must have recognized with pleasure his own
court and victories in Berenice’s description of the young Emperor’s
glory:</li>

<p>Is it any wonder that Racine, so skillful in adulation, rose rapidly
in favor with the King?</p>
<p>We pass respectfully by some lesser plays, all of them still holding
the French stage: Bajazet (1672), Mithridate (1673), which Louis liked
best of all, and Iphigenie (1674), which Voltaire ranked with Athalie as
one of the finest poems ever written. 14 Iphigenie had its premiere in
the Versailles gardens, by the light of crystal chandeliers hung in the
orange and</p>
<p>pomegranate trees; violins played; half the elite audience melted;
Racine stepped forward to acknowledge the most cherished plaudits of his
career. Produced in Paris, it ran for forty performances in three
months. Mean- while (1673) he had been elected to the French Academy.
Nothing seemed lacking to his happiness.</p>
<p>But it is still not given to poets to be happy, unless beauty proves
a joy forever, and praise encounters no discordant voice. “The applause
I have met with,” Racine told his son, “has often flattered me a great
deal; but the smallest critical censure . . . always caused me more
vexation than all the pleasure given me by praise.” 15 He himself was
not only thin -skinned, as he had to be, but he was short-tempered, and
returned every unkind word. At the height of his success he found half
of Paris carping at him, even working for his fall. Corneille had
outlived himself, but his followers remembered the heroic tone and
topics of his earlier tragedies, the air of nobility in his eloquence,
the lofty level on which he raised the calls of honor and the state
above the romances of the heart. They accused Racine of debasing the
tragic drama with the half-mad passions of ignoble creatures,
introducing to the stage the gallantries of courtly love, and drenching
it with the tears of his heroines. They were resolved to bring him down.
* “Have you seen the splendor of this night? These torches, this pyre,
this night with sacred flames, these eagles, these fasces, this
assemblage, this army, this crowd of kings, these consuls, this senate —
all taking their luster from my lover; this purple and gold made
brighter by his glory, and these laurels still bearing witness to his
victories; all these eyes that we see come from all parts to unite upon
him alone their eager glances; this majestic bearing, this sweet
presence. Heaven, with what respect and what willingness all hearts
secretly assure him of their trust! Speak: can one see him without
thinking, with me, that in whatever obscurity fate had given him birth,
the world, beholding him, would have recognized its master?”</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 1 39</p>
<p>When it became known that he was writing Phidre, a group of his</p>
<p>enemies persuaded Nicolas Pradon to write a rival play on the same
theme. Both dramas had originally the same title — Phedre et Hippolyte —
and stemmed from the legend that Euripides had told with classic
restraint. Phedra, wife of Theseus, developed an uncontrollable passion
for Hip- polytus, son of Theseus by an earlier marriage; finding him
frigid to</p>
<p>women, Phedra hanged herself, leaving in revenge a note accusing Hip-
polytus of an attempt against her virtue; Theseus banished his innocent
son, who was soon afterward killed while driving horses along Troezen’s
shores. Racine altered the sequence, making Phedra poison herself after
hearing of Hippolytus’ death. This version was produced at the Hotel de
Bourgogne on January 1, 1677; Pradon’s was staged two days later at the
Theatre de Guenegaud. Both for a time had equa l success; but Pradon’s
play is now forgotten, while Racine’s is usually rated as his
masterpiece; the role of Phedre is the goal of all French actresses, as
that of Hamlet lures the tragedians of the English theater.* Racine,
model of the classic style, rivaled the romantics in the emotionalism of
Phedra’s love, and Hippolytus (quite contrary to the legend) bums for
the Princess Aricia. Phedra learns of this passion, and Racine gives us
in excited detail a study of a woman scorned. He redeems these romantic
ecstasies with a powerful description of how the frightened horses of
Hippolytus dragged him to death.</p>
<p>In the preface to Phedre (the religious element in him now rising as
the sexual subsided) Racine offered an olive branch to Port-Royal:</p>
<p>I do not dare assure myself that this … is the best of my
tragedies</p>
<p>. . . But I am sure that I have written none in which virtue has been
put in a better light. The slightest faults are here severely punished;
the mere thought of crime is here regarded with as much horror as
the</p>
<p>crime itself. The weaknesses of love are here seen as real
weaknesses.</p>
<p>The passions are brought to view only to show all the disorder of</p>
<p>which they are the cause; and vice is here painted throughout in
colors that make us see and hate its deformity. This is the proper end
that</p>
<p>every man who works for the public should propose to himself. . .
.</p>
<p>It would perhaps be a means of reconciling the tragic drama with</p>
<p>many persons famous for their piety and their teaching who have
lately condemned it, but who would judge it more favorably if
authors</p>
<p>thought as much of instructing their spectators as of entertaining
them, and if they followed in this the true intention of tragedy .
17</p>
<p>Arnauld, famous for his piety and his teaching, welcomed this new
note, and announced his approval of Phedre. Perhaps in writing the
preface</p>
<p>• Adam Smith thought Phedre “the finest tragedy, perhaps, that is
extant in any lan - guage.” 18</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Racine, now thirty-eight, was looking forward to settling down from
multiplicity to unity. On June 1 of this year 1677 he took a
well-dowered wife. He discovered the comforts of domesticity, and found
more delight in his first child than in his most successful play. The
jealousies and cabals of competitors had soured his taste for the
theater. He put aside the plots and notes that he had made for future
dramas, and for twelve years he con- fined himself to writing occasional
verse and prose — chiefly a filial and reverent history of
Port-Royal.</p>
<p>A bitter contretemps disturbed his exemplary peace. In 1679 the
special court investigating the charges of poisoning made against
Catherine Monvoisin drew from her the accusation that Racine had
poisoned his mistress Therese du Parc. “La Voisin” gave details, but
there was no</p>
<p>corroboration. Being confident of death, she had nothing to lose by
making false accusations; and it was noted that one of her clients and
friends was the Comtesse de Soissons, a member of the clique that had
opposed Racine in the affaire Phedre . ,s Nevertheless Louvois wrote to
the commissioner Bazin de Bezons, on January 1, 1680: “The royal warrant
for the arrest of the Sieur Racine will be sent to you as soon as you
ask for it.” But as the investigation proceeded and seemed to implicate
Mme. de Montespan, the King ordered the suppression of the trial record,
and no action was taken against Racine. 19</p>
<p>Louis showed continued faith in the dramatist. In 1664 he assigned
him a pension; in 1674 he gave him a sinecure worth 2,400 livres per
year, in the department of finance; in 1677 he appointed Racine and
Boileau court historiographers; in 1690 the poet became gentleman in
ordinary to the King, which brought him an additional two thousand
livres annually. In 1696 he was rich enough to buy the office of
secretary to the King.</p>
<p>His active fulfillment of his duties as historiographe royal shared
in with- drawing him from the theater. He accompanied the King on
campaigns to record the events more faithfully. Otherwise he remained at
home, busying himself with the development of his two sons and five
daughters, but some- times, amid their turbulence, wishing that he had
become a monk. He might never have written another play had not Mme. de
Maintenon appealed to him to compose a religious drama, purified of all
love interest, to be played by the young women whom she had gathered
into the Academy of St.-Cyr. Andromaqiie had already been played there,
but the virtuous Maintenon noted that the girls enjoyed the passages of
amorous passion. To bring them back to piety Racine wrote Esther.</p>
<p>He had never before taken a theme from the Bible, but he had studied
that book for forty years, and knew all the complex history recorded in
the Old Testament. He himself coached the young ladies in their parts,
and the King contributed 100,000 francs to provide the Persian costumes
required. When it was produced (January 25, 1689) Louis was among the
few men in the audience. The clergy, then the court, clamored to see it;
St.-Cyr gave</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 141</p>
<p>twelve more performances. Esther did not reach the general public
till 1721, six years after the death of the King, and then (religion
having lost its royal patronage) it met with indifferent success.</p>
<p>On January 5, 1691, St.- Cyr produced Racine’s latest play,
Athalie.</p>
<p>Athaliah was the wicked queen who for six years led many of the Jews
into the pagan worship of Baal, until she was deposed by a priestly
revolu- tion. 20 Racine made from the story a drama whose power can be
felt only by those who come to it familiar with the Bible narrative, and
still warm with orthodox Jewish or Christian faith; others will find its
long speeches and somber spirit discouraging. The play seemed to applaud
the expulsion of the Huguenots and the triumph of the Catholic
hierarchy; on the other hand it contained, in the high priest’s warning
to the young King Joad, a strong denunciation of absolute rule:</p>
<p>Brought up far from the throne, you have not felt its poisonous</p>
<p>charm; you do not know the drunkenness of absolute power, and the
enchantment of cowardly flatterers. Soon thev will tell you that the</p>
<p>holiest laws . . . should obey the king; that a king has no other
restraint than his own will; that he should sacrifice everything to his
supreme grandeur . . . Alas! they have misled the wisest of kings.
21</p>
<p>The lines won much applause during the eighteenth century, and may
have moved Voltaire and others 22 to rank Athalie as the greatest of
French dramas. Subsequent lines suggest that the highpriest was merely
arguing for the subordination of kings to priests.</p>
<p>Louis, whose piety now exceeded Racin e’s, saw no harm in the play,
and continued to receive Racine at court despite the poet’s known
sympathy with Port-Royal. But in r 698 the royal favor lapsed. At the
request of Mme. de Maintenon Racine drew up a statement of the
sufferings that were afflicting the people of France in the final years
of the reign. The King surprised her reading this document, took it,
drew from her the author’s name, and flew into a rage. “Does he think,
because he is a perfect master of verse, that he knows everything? And
because he is a great poet does he want also to be minister?” Maintenon,
all apologies to Racine, assured him that the storm would soon pass. It
did; Racine returned to the court and was received graciously, though,
he thought, not as warmly as</p>
<p>before. 23 *</p>
<ul>
<li>Says Racine’s son: “He returned several times to the court, and
always had the honor of approaching his Majesty .” 24 Saint -Simon gives
a different account: Racine fell from favor by criticizing Scarron’s
comedies in the presence of Mm e. de Maintenon and the King. “At this
the poor widow blushed, not for the reputation of the cripple
attacked,</li>
</ul>
<p>142</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>What killed the poet was not a cold look from the King, but an
abscess of the liver. He submitted to an operation, and was for a time
relieved; but he was not deceived when he said, “Death has sent in its
bill.” 26 Boileau, himself ailing, came to stay at his friend’s bedside.
“I rejoice,” said Racine, “to be allowed to die before you.” 27 He drew
up a simple will, whose central paragraph was a plea to Port-Royal:</p>
<p>I desire that my body shall be taken to Port-Royal-des-Champs,
and</p>
<p>that it shall be buried in the cemetery there … I most humbly beg the
Mother Abbess and the nuns to grant me this honor, though I know that I
am unworthy of it, both by the scandals of my past life and by the litde
use that I have made of the excellent education that I formerly received
in that house, and the great examples of piety and penitence that I saw
there. . . . But the more I have offended God, the more do I need the
prayers of so holy a community. 2 *</p>
<p>He died April 21, 1699, aged fifty-nine. The King pensioned the widow
and the children till the death of the last survivor.</p>
<p>France ranks Racine among her greatest poets, as representing, with
Corneille, the highest development of the modem classic drama. Under
Boileau ’s urging he accepted a strict interpretation of the “three
unities,” and achieved thereby an unrivaled concentration of feeling and
power through a single action transpiring in one place and completed in
one day. He avoided the intrusion of secondary plots, and all mingling
of tragedy and comedy; he excluded commoners from his tragedies, and
dealt usually with princes and princesses, kings and queens. His
vocabulary was purged of all words that might have been out of place in
the salons or the court, or might have raised an eyebrow in the French
Academy. He complained that he did not dare mention, in his plays, so
vulgar an operation as eating, though Homer was full of it. 29 The aim
was to achieve a style that would reflect in literature the speech and
manners of the French aristocracy. These restrictions limited Racine’s
range; each of his dramas, before Esther , was like its predecessors,
and in each the sentiments were the same.</p>
<p>Despite the classical idea of intelligence overspreading life and
con- trolling emotion and speech, Racine verged upon romanticism in the
character and intensity of the feelings he expressed. Whereas in
Corneille the sentiments stressed honor, patriotism, and nobility, in
Racine they centered largely about love or passion; we sense in him the
influence of the romances of d’Urfe, Mme. de Scudery, and Mme. de La
Fayette. He ad - mired Sophocles most among all dramatists, but he
reminds us rather of Euripides, in whom the Sophoclean restraint and
dignity of expression passed now and then into an abandon of ardor and
feeling; there is more restraint of speech in Hamlet or Macbeth than in
Andromaque or Phedre.</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 143</p>
<p>Racine frankly stated his view that “the first rule” of drama “is to
please and touch the heart .” 30 He did this by dealing with the heart,
by taking as his main characters persons — usually women — of emotional
intensity, and turning his plays into a psychology of passion.</p>
<p>He accepted the classic prohibition of violent action on the stage,
and therefore restricted himself to expressing passion by speech. This
put a heavy burden upon style; the drama became a succession of
orations, and the uninterrupted march of alexandrines — twelve-syllable
lines rhyming in couplets — skirts the edge of monotony; we miss in
Racine and Corneille the flexibility, naturalness, and incalculable
variety of Elizabethan blank verse. What a labor of genius must have
been required to lift this narrow form out of a wearying sameness by the
force and beauty of style! Racine and Corneille should not be read, they
must be heard, preferably at night in the court of the Invalides or the
Louvre.</p>
<p>To compare Racine with Corneille is an old pastime among the French.
Mme. de Sevigne, after seeing Bajazet, and before Iphigenie or Phedre
had been staged, pronounced for Corneille with her usual verve. Rashly,
but perhaps rightly, she predicted:</p>
<p>Racine will never be able to go beyond . . . Andromaque . . . His
plays are written for 〔Mile.〕 Champmesle . . . When he grows old and
ceases to be in love, then it will be seen whether I am mistaken or not.
Long live, then, our friend Corneille; and let us forgive the bad lines
we</p>
<p>meet with in him for the sake of those divine passages that so often
transport us . . .</p>
<p>It is in general the opinion of everyone of good taste . 31 But
Voltaire, having undertaken to edit Corneille, shocked the French
Academy by noting the faults, the crudities, the rhetoric of the great
dramatist. “I confess,” he wrote, “that in editing Corneille I become an
idolater of Racine .” 32 Time has recognized those faults, and has
forgiven them in one who had not Racine’s advantage of coming after
Corneille. To have raised the French drama from its previous level to
the height of he Cid and Polyeucte was a more difficult achievement than
to reach the passionate ecstasies and melodious beauty of Andromaque and
Phedre. Corneille and Racine are the masculine and feminine themes in
the poetry of the Great Century — the powerful expression of honor and
love. They must be taken</p>
<p>David Hume, a canny Scot well versed in the language and literature
of France, thought that “with regard to the stage, the French have
excelled</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>even the Greeks, who far excelled the English.” 33 This is a judgment
that would have surprised Racine himself, who worshiped Sophocles as
perfec- tion, though he dared to rival Euripides. And in this he
succeeded, which is praise indeed. He kept the modem drama at a level
that only Shakespeare and Corneille had reached, and that no one but
Goethe has touched again.</p>

<li>LA FONTAINE: 1621-95</li>
</ol>
<p>In that age of flamboyant literary enmities it is a pleasure to hear
of the famous, half-legendary friendship of Boileau, Moliere, Racine,
and La Fontaine — la societe des Quatre Amis.</p>
<p>Jean de La Fontaine was the black sheep of the group. Like the
others, he came from the middle class; the aristocracy is too interested
in the art of life to spare time for the life of art. Bom at
Chateau-Thierry in</p>
<p>Champagne, son of the local Master of the Waters and Forests, he grew
up as an eager part of surrounding nature, became a lover of fields,
woods, trees, streams, and all their denizens; he learned the habits,
and divined with sympathy the aims, worries, and thoughts of a hundred
species of animals; all he had to do, when he wrote, was to make these
multipede philosophers speak, and he became another Aesop, fused by his
fables into the memory of millions.</p>
<p>His parents thought they would make a priest of him, but he had no
flair for the supernatural. He tried to practice law, but he found
poetry much more intelligible. He married a rich girl (1647), gave her a
son, arranged a separation from his wife (1658), went to Paris, pleased
Fouquet, and received from that amiable embezzler a pension of a
thousand livres, on condition of quarterly payments in verses. When
Fouquet fell La</p>
<p>Fontaine addressed to the King a courageous petition for the
financier’s pardon; consequently he never basked in the royal sun. Shorn
of his pension, La Fontaine, who had no notion of making a living, was
housed and fed by the Duchesse de Bouillon, whom we have met as a
Frondeuse. While under her wing he published (1664) the first book of
his Contes , a collection of novelettes in verse, Boccaccianly risque,
but told with such disarming simplicity that soon half of France, even
blushing maidens, read them.*</p>
<ul>
<li>Take as example Le Faiseur d’oreilles-The Maker of Ears. Sir William
goes to the city for business, leaving his wife, Alix, pregnant. Her
relative Andre warns her that, judging from the color of her
countenance, her child will be lacking an ear. He offers himself as a
surgeon, and explains that a bout of love will supply the missing
member. She accepts the prescription, and takes several doses, until the
thought occurs , to her that the child will have too many ears. When
William returns he restores the moral balance by seducing Andre’s wife .

<p>Shortly thereafter Marguerite of Lorraine, dowager Duchess of
Orleans, installed him in the Luxembourg Palace as gentleman in waiting.
There he wrote more Contes , and thence he sent to the printer the first
six books of his fabulous Fables (1668). He pretended that they were
paraphrases of Aesop or Phaedrus; some were; some were taken from the
legendary Bidpai of India, some from the fabliaux of France; but most of
them were re- created in the bubbling rivulet of La Fontaine’s mind and
verse. The very first one was an unwitting summary of his careless,
singing life:</p>

<p>“I will pay you,” she said,</p>
<p>“Before harvest, on the faith of</p>

<p>The ant is not a lender;</p>
<p>This is his least fault;</p>
<p>“What were you doing in summer?”</p>
<p>He asked this borrower.</p>
<p>“Night and day to every comer</p>
<p>I sang; do not be displeased.”</p>
<p>“You sang! I am happy to hear it.</p>
<p>Well, then, dance now.”</p>
<p>La Fontaine was wiser than Descartes, who thought all animals to be
thoughtless automata; the poet loved them, sensed their reasoning, and
found in them all the livable lessens of philosophy. France was charmed
to receive wisdom in such digestible doses. The fabulist became the most
widely read author in the land. The critics for once agreed with the
people, and joined in his praise; for though simplicity was his soul, he
knew the French language in its peasant color and earthy tang, and gave
his verses such supple grace, delectable turns, vivid pictures in a
line, that all the bourgeois gentilshommes in France rejoiced to find
that their animals, even their insects, had been talking poetry all the
time. “I use animals,” La Fontaine said, “to instruct men.” 35</p>
<p>In 1673 Marguerite of Lorraine died, and the poet, who had been</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>singing improvidently and had not managed well the modest fees
allowed him for his books, found himself rich in debts. He had better
luck than his grasshopper, for the learned and kindly Mme. de La
Sabli&amp;re gave him lodging, food, and motherly care in her home on
the Rue St.-Honore, and there he lived in quiet content till her death
in 1693. He divided his time (he tells us) into two parts: one part for
sleep, the other for doing nothing. 86 La Bruy&amp;re described him as a
man who could make animals, trees, and stones speak elegantly, but was
himself dull, “heavy; and stupid” in con - versation; 87 however, there
are contrary reports that he could be a lively causeur when he found
congenial ears. 88 A hundred anecdotes, largely legendary, celebrated
his absent-mindedness. Being late for dinner, he excused himself: “I
have just come from the funeral of an ant; I followed the procession to
the cemetery, and I escorted the family home.” 39 Louis XIV opposed his
election to the French Academy, on the ground that the poet’s life and
Contes were hardly exemplary; finally he relented (1684), saying that La
Fontaine had promised to behave. But the old poet knew no distinction
between virtue and sin, only between natural and unnatural; he had
learned his ethics in the woods. Like Moliere, he felt no attraction
toward Port-Royal, those bons disputeurs (he called them) whose “lessons
seem to me a bit depressing.” 40 For a time he joined the coterie of
freethinkers at the Temple, but when a stroke nearly felled him in the
street, he thought it time to make his peace with the Church; still, he
wondered, “was St. Augustine as wise as Rabelais?” 41 He died in 1695,
aged seventy-four. His nurse was confident of his eternal salvation,
for, she said, “he was so simple that God would not have the courage to
damn him.” 42</p>
<p>V. BOILEAU: 1636-17II</p>
<p>In the meetings of the Four Friends in the Rue du Vieux Colombier the
conversation was usually dominated by Nicolas Boileau, who laid down the
rules of literature and morals with all the authority and confidence of
Dr. Johnson at the Turk’s Hea d Tavern in Soho. Like Johnson, Boileau
was more important as a voice than as an author; his best works are
middling poetry, but his edicts were of more lasting effect in
literature than those of Louis XIV in politics. His friendship and
critical acclaim helped</p>
<p>Moli&amp;re and Racine to survive the antics of hostile cabals.</p>
<p>He was the fourteenth child of a clerk in the Paris Parlement.
Destined for the priesthood, he studied theology at the Sorbonne. He
rebelled, took up law, and was entering practice when his father died
(1657), leaving him a patrimony sufficient to support him in verse. He
spent ten years</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>sharpening his pen; then, in twelve Satires (i666f.), he pronounced
judg- ment upon his fellow men. He was alarmed by “this frightful crowd
of famished rhymesters”; 43 he attacked it as a horde of locusts; he
named names, making enemies by the rhyme; and, to bring the women too
down upon his head, he ridiculed the romances with which Mmes. de
Scudery and de La Fayette were using the paper and hours of France. He
praised the ancients, and, among the modems, Malherbe and Racan, Moliere
and Racine. “I think,” he said, “that without wounding conscience or t
he state, we may call bad poetry bad, and have full right to be bored by
a foolish book.” 44 These Satires bore us in their turn because their
aim was</p>
<p>achieved: the poets condemned were destroyed beyond our memory or
interest; moreover, the tender-minded amongst us, especially if we are
authors, prefer critics who direct us to the good rather than those who
belabor the bad.</p>
<p>Having adopted the severity of Juvenal in the Satires , Boileau in a
series of Epistles (1669- 95) restrained his hatchet to Horace’s milder
mood, and achieved a smoother style. It was these poetic letters that
led Louis to invite him to the court. The King asked him which of his
own verses he thought the best. Boileau, with an eye to the main chance,
read nothing from his published work, but recited as “least bad” some
still unprinted lines in honor of Le Grand Monarque. He was rewarded
with a pension of two thousand livres, 45 and became persona grata at
the court. “I like Boileau,” said Louis, “as a necessary scourge that we
can pit against the bad taste of second -rate authors.” 46 And as Louis
sustained Moliere against the bigots, so he raised no</p>
<p>The poem that has carried him over the whirlpools of time is VArt</p>
<p>poetique (1674), which has rivaled in influence its model, Horace’s
Ars poetica. At the outset Boileau warns young bards that Parnassus is
steep; let them be sure, before they set out to climb that sacred mount
of the Muses, that they have something worth saying, something that
will</p>
<p>strengthen truth and tendra au bon sens — will make for good sense
and taste. Vary your discourse, he advises them; a style too equal and
uniform (like Bo ileau’s) puts us to sleep; and “happy the poet who,
with a light touch, passes from the grave to the sweet, from the
pleasant to the severe.” 47 Keep a sharp ear for the cadence of your
words. Follow Malherbe’s rules on language and style. Study not your
contemporaries but the ancients: in epic poetry Homer and Virgil, in
tragic drama Sophocles, in comedy Terence, in satire Horace, in eclogue
Theocritus. “Make haste slowly;</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>without losing courage, put your work on the anvil twenty times . . .
Add occasionally, omit often .” 48 “Love those who criticize you, and,
bowing to reason, correct yourself without complaint .” 49 “Work for
glory, and let not sordid gain be ever the object of your toil .” 50 If
you write dramas, observe the unities:</p>
<p>QiCen un lieu , qu’en un jour, un seul fait accompli</p>
<p>Tienne jusqu’ a la fin le theatre rempli</p>
<p>— “Let one action, completed in one place and one day, keep the
theater</p>
<p>Boileau joined Moliere in making les precieuses ridiculous, and
he</p>
<p>scorned the artificial love poetry that had enfeebled French verse.
Against this bathos of sentiment he raised the Cartesian worship of
reason and the classic inculcation of restraint. He formulated the
principles of the classic style, and summarized them in two classic
lines:</p>
<p>Aimez done la raison ; que toujour s vos ecrits</p>
<p>Empruntent d’elle seule et leur lustre et leur prix</p>
<p>— “Love reason, then; let your writings take from it both their
splendor and their worth .” 53 No sentimentality, no emotionalism, no
bombast; no pedantry, no artificiality, no pompous obscurity. The ideal
in literature, as in life, is a stoic self- control, and “nothing in
excess.”</p>
<p>Boileau loved Moliere, but regretted his descents into farce. He
loved Racine, but apparently did not remark his romantic exaltation of
feeling, and his emotion-bursting heroines — Hermione, Berenice, Phedre.
A warrior must exaggerate his share of the truth. Boileau was too lusty
a battler to understand what Pascal had said — that the heart has its
reasons which the head cannot understand, and that literature without
feeling may be as smooth as marble and as cold. Horace had allowed for
feeling: “If you wish me to weep,” to feel what you write, “you must
weep first” — you must feel the matter yourself. All the literature and
art of the Middle Ages remained hidden from Boileau.</p>
<p>The influence of his teaching was immense. Through three generations
French poetry and prose tried to adhere to his classic rules. These
shared in molding the style of English literature in the “Augustan Age,”
whose Pope frankly imitated V Art poetique in his Essay on Criticism.
Boileau’s influence did harm and good. By deprecating imagination and
feeling, it put a damper on poetry in France after Racine and in England
after Dryden; verse at its best took on the chiseled form of sculpture,
but lost the warmth</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 149</p>
<p>and color of painting. Nevertheless it was good that the ideal of
reason should enter into belles-lettres; too much nonsense had been
written about love and shepherds; Europe needed Boileau’s angry scorn to
cleanse the literary air of absurdity, affectation, and shallow
sentiment. Perhaps it was in part through Boileau that Moliere rose from
farce to philosophy, and Racine perfected his art.</p>
<p>It was just like Boileau that when, with a gift from the King (1687),
he bought a house and garden in Auteuil, he said nothing in his writings
of the nature that surrounded him — except that from those fields he now
took the name Despreaux. There, for nearly all his remaining years, he
lived in simple peace, never visiting the court, but warmly welcoming
his friends. People noted that “he had many friends, though he spoke ill
of every - body.” 54 He was brave enough to express sy mpathy for
Port-Royal, and to tell a Jesuit that Pascal’s Provincial Letters were a
masterpiece of French prose. He outlived all of the circle of which he
had been the honored theorist: Moliere was long since gone, La Fontaine
went in 1695, Racine in 1 699; the old and ailing satirist spoke
feelingly of “the dear friends whom we have lost, and who have
disappeared velut somnium surgentis” — like the dream of a man rising
from sleep. 55 As death neared he left Auteuil, and went to die (1711)
in the rooms of his confessor in the cloister of Notre Dame. There, he
hoped, Satan would not dare touch him.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE ROMANTIC PROTEST</li>
</ol>
<p>The ladies did not take as kindly to the classic canons of reason,
modera- tion, and restraint as old Corneille and young Racine. Their
world was a realm of feeling and romance, and the manages de convenance
that they contracted stirred rather than checked the fantasies of love.
Alongside the classic drama the romantic novel grew to immense
proportions, wide acclaim, and international influence. The ladies of
France never had enough of such novels, and never found them too long.
When Gauthier de La Calprenede stopped his Cleopdtre after ten volumes
(1656), his fiancee refused to marry him until he had concluded it in
two more. 56</p>
<p>Mile. Madeleine de Scudery enslaved half of France with her
ten-volume novels, Artamene, ou le Grand Cyrus (1649-53) anc * Clelie
(1654-60). French society was flattered to find that in these romantic
proliferations the characters, under pseudonyms, described and revealed
the celebrities of the time. Soon the ladies and gentlemen of the salons
called themselves by names from the romances, and learned to sigh and
deny like their heroes and heroines; Mile, de Scudery herself became
Sappho, and was so addressed in the salons to the end of her ninety-four
years. She wrote to please her</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>brother Georges, published her books under his name, and preferred
his surveillance to marriage. Her reign over literate women and perfumed
men continued until Moliere’s Precieuses ridicules and Femmes savantes
changed literary fashions; then Madeleine bravely kept the last of her
ninety volumes from the press. Those who suffer from leisure may still
locate in the fifteen thousand pages of Le Grand Cyrus, or the ten
thousand of Clelie, passages distinguished by the delicacy of their
sentiment, or remarkable for their analysis of character. And La Scud6ry
deserves remembrance, too, for having labored to advance the education
of women in France.</p>
<p>Marie Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, who became by marriage the
Comtesse de La Fayette, is a more attractive figure because she not only
wrote a famous romance, but lived one more famous still. She received an
unusually full education. After her marriage (1655) she went to live in
Auvergne. Finding life dull there, she arranged an amicable separation
from her husband (1659), came to Paris, and joined the circle that met
at the Hotel de Rambouillet. She became lady in waiting to Madame Hen-
rietta, and later commemorated her in a loving memoir. She was a
relative but friend of Mme. de Sevigne, who, after forty years of
intimacy, wrote of her: “Never did we have the smallest cloud upon our
friendship; long habit had not made her merit stale to me; the flavor of
it was always fresh and new.” 57 This is an exceptional compliment to
both parties, for friend - ships are as mortal as romantic love. We
shall find a rare union of love and friendship in Mme. de La Fayette’s
relations with La Rochefoucauld.</p>
<p>When she decided to cross pens with Mile, de Scudery she hit upon a
revolutionary innovation: she wrote a romance in one volume only two
hundred pages long. She adopted the principle that, other things equal,
the best book is that which omits most of its original form; every
sentence omitted, she said, added a louis d’or to the value of the book,
and every word omitted added twenty sous. After some minor products she
com- posed (1672) and published (1678) her chef-d’oeuvre, La Princesse
de Cleves. The plot (to mix figures) was a triangle with a tangent.
Mile, de Chartres is so modestly beautiful that the Prince de Cleves
becomes her slave at first sight. On her mother’s advice she marries
him, but with no warmer sentiment than respect. Soon thereafter the Due
de Nemours sees her and falls precipitately in love with her. She repels
him virtuously, but his feverish persistence touches her; and gradually
her pity turns to love. She confesses this development to her husband,
and begs him to take her away from the court and temptation. He cannot
believe that she is faith- ful, and worries himself to death* gored, so
to speak, with his own imagi- nary horns. The Princess, in remorse over
his death, repulses the Duke, and devotes the rest of her life to
charity. The skeptical Bayle remarked that</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 1 5 1</p>
<p>if so pure and faithful a woman could be found in France he would
walk twelve hundred miles to see her. 58</p>
<p>The book was published anonymously, but the literary world soon de-
cided that it was one result of an already famous intimacy. Said Mile,
de Scudery, “M. de La Rochefoucauld and Mme. de La Fayette have written
a novel . . . which I am told is admirably done”; 59 but she added,
“They are no longer of an age to do anythi ng else together.” 60 Both
the alleged authors disclaimed authorship. “The Princesse de Cleves
wrote La</p>
<p>Scudery, “is a poor orphan, disowned by father and mother.” In any
case there was general agreement that this was the finest novel yet
written in France. Fontenelle confessed to having read it four times,
and Boileau, foe of romance, judged Mme. de La Fayette “the finest
spirit and best writer among the women of France.” History recognizes La
Princesse de Cleves as one of the first, and still one of the best,
psychological novels. It is the only French novel of that age that can
still be read without pain.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>MME. DE SEVIGNE: 1 62 6-96</li>
</ol>
<p>But there are ten volumes surviving from that reign — and also by a
woman — that even in the palpitation of our time can be read with a
self- surrendering delight. Marie de Rabutin-Chantal lost her parents in
her childhood, and inherited their substantial fortune. Some of the best
minds in France collaborated in her education, and the best families in
France formed her in the arts of life. At eighteen she married Henri,
Marquis de Sevigne; but this philanderer loved her fortune more than
herself, squan- dered part of it on mistresses, fought a duel over one
of these, and was killed (1651). Marie tried to forget him, but she
never married again, absorbed in bringing up her son and daughter.
Perhaps, as her malicious cousin Bussy- Rabutin suggested, she was of “a
cold disposition”; 61 or per - haps she had learned that sex depletes
while parentage fulfills. Her letters are alive with happiness, almost
all parental.</p>
<p>She loved society as much as she distrusted marriage. As a young
widow with 530,000 livres, 62 she had many a noble suitor — Turenne,
Rohan, Bussy . . . She saw no sense in driving all but one of them away;
yet no word of scandal or liaison has clouded her name. She was loved
with a less doubtful sincerity by her friends, who included de Retz, La
Roche- foucauld, Mme. de La Fayette, and Fouquet. The first two were
barred from the court for participation in the Fronde, the last for
inexplicable wealth; Mme. de Sevigne, as warmly faithful to all four,
was not welcome in the sacred precincts, though we find her receiving
some gracious words from the King at a performance of Esther at St.-Cyr.
Outside the court</p>
<p>G 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>many circles took pleasure in her company, for she had all the graces
of a cultured woman, and conversed as spiritedly as she wrote. This is
the reverse of a more usual compliment; we are often advised, perhaps
reck- lessly, to write as we speak.</p>
<p>Over fifteen hundred of her letters survive, nearly all to her
daughter; for Fran§oise Marguerite married (1669) the Comte de Grignan,
and soon went to live with him in Provence, where he was lieutenant
governor. From 1671 to 1690 the mother dispatched a letter by almost
every post — sometimes twice a day — to this young wife now separated
from her by the length of France. “The correspondence I have with you,”
she told her, “is my well -being, the sole pleasure of my life; every
other con- sideration is but mean when put in competition with this.” 63
The love that</p>
<p>The most touching incident in these letters is the life and
conventual death of Mme. de Grignan’s first child. She came to Paris to
be delivered under the care of her mother. Soon she sent an apology to
her husband for having borne a girl — who would have to be reared
painfully, dowered expensively, and then lost; and when Fran9oise
returned to Provence she left little Marie Blanche for a while with the
fascinated grandma. Mme. de Sevigne wrote to the father: “If you want a
son, take the trouble to make him.” 64 She wrote to the unappreciative
paren ts ecstatic details of the marvel they had reluctantly
begotten:</p>
<p>Your little girl grows lovable. . . , white as snow, and laughing</p>
<p>incessantly . . . Her complexion, her throat, all her little body,
are</p>
<p>wonderful. She does a hundred little things — babbling, coaxing,
strik- ing, making the sign of the cross, asking pardon, making a bow,
kissing her hand, shrugging her shoulders, dancing, wheedling, plucking
your chin … I amuse myself with her for hou rs together.” 65</p>
<p>It cost Grandma many a tear to let the plump miracle go to Provence;
and many more when the parents put her into a convent when she was still
but five years old. The child never came back. At the age of fifteen she
took the vows, and disappeared from the world.</p>
<p>The lieutenant governor was extravagant, and entertained beyond his
station. His wife periodically informed her mother of their approaching
bankruptcy; the mother scolded them lovingly, and sent them great
sums.</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE</p>

<p>“How, for the love of God or man, can one keep so much gold, so much
silver, so many jewels, such furniture, amid the extreme misery of the
poor who surround us in these times ?” 66 To keep herself solvent after
these deductions, Mme. de Sevigne traveled laboriously to her property
at Les Rochers in Brittany to see that it was properly tended, and its
rents transmitted to her with only reasonable pilferage. She found a new
happi- ness in the fields, the woods, and the Breton peasantry, and
wrote of them as vividly as of that Parisian society of which she was
the semiweekly newsletter for her daughter.</p>
<p>Her son was a problem of another kind. She was very fond of him, for
he was good- natured, and had, she tells us, a “fund of wit and humor. .
. . He used to read us some chapters out of Rabelais, which were enough
to make one die of laughter .” 67 Charles was a model son, except that
he walked in his father’s steps from one port of call to another, until
— but let Madame, writing to her daughter, bear responsibility for the
rest; nothing could better illustrate the tone of the time:</p>
<p>A word or two concerning your brother . . . Yesterday he wanted
to</p>
<p>acquaint me with a dreadful accident that had befallen him. He had
met with a happy moment; but when he came to the point — It was a</p>
<p>strange thing! The poor damsel never had been so entertained in her
life. The cavalier, quite defeated, retired, thinking himself bewitched;
and, what you will find better than all the rest, he could not be easy
till he had acquainted me with his disaster. We laughed very heartily at
him; I told him I was overjoyed to find him punished in the sinful part
… It was a scene for Moliere . 68</p>
<p>He contracted syphilis; she berated him; but she nursed him
lovingly.</p>
<p>She tried to infuse a little religion into him, but she had so little
of it herself that she could not give him much. She was moved by
Bourdaloue’s sermons, and had some spurts of piety, but she smiled at
the religious processions that so pleased the people of the tenements.
She read Amauld, Nicole, and Pascal, and sympathized with Port-Royal,
but she was repelled by their concentration on avoiding damnation; she
could not bring herself to believe in hell . 69 In general she shied
away from serious thought; such matters were not for women, and
disturbed the charm of a comfortable life. Yet her reading was of the
best — Virgil, Tacitus, and St. Augustine in Latin, Montaigne in French,
and she knew intimately the plays of</p>
<p>Corneille and Racine. Her humor was heartier, more joyous, than
Moliere’s. Hear her on a friend given to absent-minded
contemplation:</p>
<p>Brancas was overturned the other day into a ditch, where he found</p>
<p>himself so much at his ease that he asked those who came to help
him</p>

<p>out if they had any occasion for his services. His glasses were
broken, and his head would have been so too, if he had not been more
lucky than wise; but all this did not seem to have interrupted his
meditation in the least. I wrote him word this morning … to let him know
that</p>
<p>he had been overturned and was very near breaking his neck, as I</p>
<p>supposed he was the only person in Paris that had not heard of it.
70</p>
<p>Altogether, these letters make one of the most revealing portraits in
literature, for the Marquise chronicles her faults and virtues
carelessly. A loving mother, at home in the salons of the capital and
the fields of</p>
<p>Brittany; telling her daughter of the latest gossip of the
aristocracy, but also that “the nightingale, the cuckoo, and the warbler
are beginning 〔to si ng〕 in the spring of the woods”; rarely uttering
an ill word about the hundreds of persons who flutter through her two
thousand pages; always ready to help those in trouble, and gracing her
speech with delicate com- pliments and courtesy; guilty, now and then,
of unfeeling mirth (as when she joked about the hanging of some poor
Breton rebels), yet sensitive to the sufferings of the poor; condoning
the immorality of her times and class, but herself of conduct
irreproachable; a spirit bubbling with good will and joie de vivre; too
modest to publish a book, but writing the best French in that age of the
best French ever written.</p>
<p>Did she think her letters might be published? Sometimes she indulged
in rhetorical flights as if smelling printers’ ink; ye t her letters are
full of business details, emotional intimacies, and compromising
revelations, which she could hardly have intended for the public eye.
She knew that her daughter showed her letters to friends, but such
sharing was frequent in those days, when correspondence was almost the
sole means of com- munication through distances. Her granddaughter
Pauline, whom she kept from following Blanche Marie into a nunnery,
inherited and preserved the . letters, but they were not published till
1726, thirty years after the Mar- quise’s death. They are now among the
most treasured classics in the litera - ture of France, a rich bouquet
whose fragrance grows with the centuries.</p>
<p>As she neared the end of her life she thought more about religion,
and confessed her fear of death and judgment. In the mists of Brittany
and the rains of Paris she developed rheumatism, lost her joy in life,
and discovered that she was mortal..</p>
<p>I embarked upon life without my consent, and I must go out of it;</p>
<p>this overwhelms me. And how shall I go? . . . When will it be? . .
.</p>
<p>I bury myself in these thoughts, and I find death so terrible that I
hate life more because it leads me toward death than because of the
thorns with which it is planted. You will say that I want to live
forever. Not</p>
<p>at all; but if my opinion had been asked, I should have preferred to
die</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>in my nurse’s arms. That would have removed me from vexations of
spirit, and would have given me Heaven full surely and easily. 71</p>
<p>It was not true that she hated life because it led to death; she
hated death because she had enjoyed life intensely for almost seventy
years. Wishing to die in the home of her beloved daughter, she crossed
France through four hundred miles and pains to the Chateau Grignan. When
death came she faced it with a courage that surprised herself, comforted
with the sacraments and hoping for immortality. It has been granted
her.</p>

<li>LA ROCHEFOUCAULD: 1613-80</li>
</ol>
<p>What a different spirit was the most famous of modern cynics, the
most merciless unmasker of bur frailties, the gloomy invalid who
slandered women and love, and whom three women loved to their death?</p>
<p>He was the sixth Francois de La Rochefoucauld, bom of a long line of
princes and counts, eldest son of the grand master of the wardrobe to
Queen and Regent Marie de Medicis. Until he inherited the ducal title on
his father’s death (1650), he was Prince de Marsillac. He was educated
in Latin, mathematics, music, dancing, fencing, heraldry, and etiquette.
Aged fourteen, he was married, by his father’s arrangement, to Andree de
Vivonne, only daughter and heir of the late grand falconer of France. At
fifteen he was given command of a cavalry regiment; at sixteen he bought
a colonelcy. He attended the salon of Mme. de Rambouillet, which
polished his manners and style. With all the idealism of youth, and its
preference for mature women, he fell in love with the Queen, with Mme.
de Chevreuse, with Mile, de Hautefort. When Anne of Austria plotted
against Richelieu, . Frangois served her, was detected, and was for a
week imprisoned in the Bastille (1636). Soon released, he was banished
to the family estate at Verteuil. He reconciled himself for a time to
living with his wife, played with his young sons Frangois and Charles,
and learned that the countryside has delights that only the city can
understand.</p>
<p>In those days, among the French upper classes, a legal marriage could
not be dissolved, but it could be ignored. After a decade of restless
monog- amy, the Prince set out for adventure in war or love. When he set
his sights on Mme. de Longueville (1646) it was no longer through
idealistic devotion but in the resolve to capture a renowned and
well-defended citadel; it would be a distinction to seduce the wife of a
duke and the sister of the Great Conde. For her part she may have
accepted him for political reasons; he could be a useful ally in the
aristocratic rebellion wherein she was resolved to play an active role.
When she informed him that he had</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>made her pregnant, 72 he gave all his support to the Fronde. In 1652
she molted him, and took on the Due de Nemours; La Rochefoucauld tried
to convince himself that this was what he had desired; as he put it
later, “When we have loved someone to the point of weariness . . . ,
most wel - come … is some act of infidelity that may justify us in
disengaging our affection.” 73 In that year, fighting for the Fronde in
the Faubourg St. - Antoine, he was struck by a musket shot that injured
both his eyes, leav- ing him partly blind. He retired again to
Verteuil.</p>
<p>He was now forty years old, beginning to suffer from gout, and
em-</p>
<p>bittered by misfortunes mostly of his own contrivance. His idealism
had died in the wake of Mme. de Longueville, and in the shifty intrigues
and ignoble end of the Fronde. He amused his hours, and defended his
career, in Memoir es ( 1 662 ) that showed him a careful master of the
classic style. In 1661 he was allowed to return to the court; henceforth
he divided his time between his wife at Verteuil and his friends in the
Paris salons.</p>
<p>His favorite salon was that of Mme. de Sable. There she and her
guests occasionally played a game of Sentences: someone would offer a
comment on human nature or conduct, and the group would toss it pro and
con. Mme. de Sable was a neighbor and devoted friend of
Port-Royal-de-Paris; she adopted its view of the natural wickedness of
man and the emptiness of earthly life; La Rochefoucauld’s pessimism,
born of disillusionments in love and war, of political treachery and
physical pain, of deceiving and being deceived, may have received a
minor reinforcement from the Jansen- ism of his hostess. He found a
somber pleasure in refining at leisure his own sentences and those of
others; he allowed these apothegms to be read, some- times amended, by
Mme. de Sable and other friends. One of these copied them; a Dutch
pirate publisher printed 189 of them, anonymously, about 1663; salon
circles recognized them as La Rochefoucauld’s; and the author himself
issued a better edition, with 317 entries, in 1665, under the title of
Sentences et maximes morales. The little book, soon known briefly as
Maximes, became almost at once a classic. Readers not only admired the
precise, compact, and chiseled style; they enjoyed the exposure of other
people’s selfishness, and only rarely realized that the story was told
about themselves.</p>
<p>La Rochefoucauld’s standpoint is stated in his second maxim: “Self
-love 〔amour de soi 〕 is the love of a man’s own self, an d of
anything else for his own sake … A man’s whole life is but one continued
exercise and strong agitation of it.” Vanity ( amour -propre ) is only
one of the many forms that self-love takes, but even that form enters
into almost every action and tho ught. Our passions may sometimes sleep,
but our vanity never rests. “He that refuses praise the first time that
it is offered does so because he would hear it a second time.” 74 The
hunger for applause is the source of all con -</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 157</p>
<p>scious literature and heroism. “All men are proud alike; the only
difference is that all do not take the same methods of showing it .” 75
“Virtues are lost in self- interest, as rivers are in the sea .” 76 “If
we reflect upon our ‘secret’ thoughts, we shall find within our own
breast the seed of all those vices which we condemn in others,” and we
shall be able to judge, from our private corruption, the basic depravity
of mankind . 77 We are the slaves of our passions; if one passion is
overcome it is not by reason but by another passion ; 78 “intellect is
always the dupe of feeling”; “men never desire any - thing very eagerly
which they desire only by the dictates of reason”; 79 and “the plainest
man, with the help of passion, will prevail more than the most eloquent
man without it .” 80</p>
<p>The art of life lies in concealing our self-love sufficiently to
avoid antag- onizing the self-love of others. We must pretend to some
degree of altruism. “Hypocrisy is a sort of homage which vice pays to
virtue .” 81 The phi - losopher’s supposed contempt of riches or noble
birth is just his way of exalting his own wares. Friendship is “only a
kind of traffic in which self - love ever proposes t o be the gainer”;
82 we may measure its sincerity by noting that we find something not
altogether displeasing in the misfortunes of our friends . 83 We more
readily forgive those who have injured us than those whom we have
injured, or who have obliged — therefore obligated — us with favors . 84
Society is a war of each against all. “True love is like ghosts —
something that everyone talks of but scarcely anyone has seen”; 85 and
“if we had never heard discourse of love, most of us would never have
fallen in love .” 86 Yet love, when real, is so profound an experience
that women who have once known it can have little capacity for
friendship, finding the latter by comparison so cold and flat . 87 Hence
women hardly exist except when in love. “Some ladies may be met with who
never had any intrigue at all; but it will be exceeding hard to find any
who have had one and no more .” 88 “The generality of honest women are
like hidden treasures, which are safe only because nobody has sought
them .” 89</p>
<p>The ailing cynic knew quite well that these epigrams were not a just
description of humanity. He hedged many of them with “almost,” “nearly,”
or the like philosophical cautions; he confessed that “it is easier to
know mankind in general than any one man in particular”; 90 and his
preface allowed that his maxims did not apply to those “few favorites
whom Heaven</p>
<p>x 5 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>there be), which lies hidden in the bottom of our hearts.” 94 And
“though it may be said, with great truth . . . , that men never act
without a regard for their own interest, yet it does not follow that all
that they do is corrupt, and that no such thing as justice or honesty is
left in the world. Men may govern themselves by noble means, and propose
〔to themselves〕 interests full of commendation and honor.” 95</p>
<p>Old age softened La Rochefoucauld, even while it darkened his gloom.
In 1670 his wife died, after forty-three years of patient fidelity,
having given him eight children, and having nursed him for the last
eighteen years. In 1672 his mother died, and he confessed that her life
had been a long miracle of love. In that year two of his sons were
wounded in the invasion of Holland; one succumbed to his injuries. The
bastard son whom Mme. de Longueville had borne, whom he had not been
allowed to claim as his own, but had deeply loved, fell in the same
unholy war. “I have see n La Roche- foucauld weep,” reported Mme. de
Sevigne, “with a tenderness that made me adore him.” 96 Was his love for
his mother and his sons self -love? Yes, if we may view these as part
and extensions of his self. This is the recon- ciliation of altruism and
egoism — that altruism is the expansion of the self, and of self- love,
to one’s family, or friends, or community. Society can be satisfied with
such embracing magn-anim-ous selfishness.</p>
<p>One of La Rochefoucauld’s most superficial remarks was that “few</p>
<p>women’s worth lasts longer than their beauty.” 97 His mother and his
wife were exceptions, and it was ungenerous to ignore the thousands of
women who had lost their physical beauty in the service of men and other
children. In 1665 a third woman offered him most of her life. Doubtless
Mme. de La Fayette pleased her own heart in seeking to comfort him. He
was fifty-two, gouty, and half-blind; she was thirty-three, still
beautiful, but herself an invalid, suffering from tertian fever. She had
been appalled by the cynicism of the Maximes, and perhaps some pleasant
notion of reforming and com- forting this unhappy man entered into her
view. She invited him to her home in Paris; he came, carried in a sedan
chair; she swathed and cushioned his aching foot; she brought her
friends, including the effervescent Mme. de Sevigne, to help her
entertain him. He came again, and even more fre- quently, until his
visits aroused the gossip of Paris. We do not know if sexual intimacy
was involved; in any case it was a minor part in what proved to be an
exchange of. souls. “He gave me understanding,” she said, “but I
reformed his heart.” 98 He may have helped her with La Princess de
Cleves, though the tenderness and delicacy of that romance are all the
world apart from the harshness of the Maximes.</p>
<p>After the death of Mme. de La Rochefoucauld this historic friendship
became a kind of spiritual marriage, and French literature contains many
a picture of the frail little woman sitting quietly beside the old
philosopher</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE</p>
<p>1 59</p>
<p>immobilized with pain. “Nothing,” said Mme. de Sevigne, “could be com
- pared to the charm and confidence of their friendship.” 99 Someone
said that where La Rochefoucauld ends, Christianity begins; 100 it
proved true in this case. Perhaps Mme. de La Fayette, sincerely pious,
persuaded him that only religion could answer the problems of
philosophy. When he felt himself dying he asked Bishop Bossuet to give
him the last sacraments (1680). His friend survived him for thirteen
ailing years.</p>

<p>Eight years after La Rochefoucauld’s death Jean de La Bruy ere con
-</p>
<p>firmed his sardonic analysis of Parisian humanity. Jean was the son
of a minor civil servant. He studied law, bought a minor governmental
office, became tutor to the grandson of the Great Conde, served the
Conde family as ecuyer gentilhomme — gentleman in waiting — and followed
it to Chan- tilly and Versailles. He remained a bachelor to the end of
his life.</p>
<p>Sensitive and shy, he suffered from the sharp edge of class
distinctions in France, and he could not evoke the amiable pretenses
that might have smoothed his way, despite his middle-class origin, among
the aristocracy and at the court. He observed the royal menagerie with a
hostile and pene- trating eye, and took his revenge by describing it in
a book into which he poured nearly all his intellectual substance. He
entitled it Les Caracteres de Theophraste traduits du grec avec les
caracteres ou les moeurs de ce siecle — The Characters of Theophrastus
Translated from the Greek, ’with the Characters or Manners of This Age.
The book became the talk of Paris, for under recognizable disguises it
portrayed persons well known in the city or at the court; and each of
them reveled in the exposure of the rest. “Keys” were published,
purporting to identify the portraits with their originals; La Bruyere
protested that the resemblances were accidental, but no one believed it,
and his fame was made. Eight editions were used up before the author’s
death in 1696; to each he added new “characters,” in which Paris saw the
mirror of the time.</p>
<p>To us today, who have lost the key to this gallery, the material
seems a bit thin, the ideas traditional and hackneyed, the spirit a bit
envious, the satire too facile, as of Menalcas, the absent-minded man.
101 La Bruyere asked for no change in the religion or government of
France. He thought it good that there should be poor people; otherwise
it would be difficult to get servants, and there would be no one to mine
or till the earth; the fear of poverty is indispensable to the
production of wealth. 102 He proudly numbered Bossuet among his friends;
he repeated in the final section of his book (“Of Freethinkers”) the
arguments that the great preacher had ex -</p>
<p>l6o THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. V</p>
<p>pressed with better judgment and in nobler prose; he echoed the
proofs that Descartes had given of God and immortality; and with some
skill he invoked against the agnostics of his time the order and majesty
of the heavens, the signs of design in living things, and the sense of
self-determina- tion in the will, and of immateriality in the mind. He
struck at the arrogance of aristocrats, the greed of financiers, and the
servility of courtiers, whom he pictured as facing Louis, rather than
the altar, in the chapel at Versailles; but he took care to hand
protective bouquets to the King . 103 In at least one passage he put
caution aside, and rose bravely to describe the bestial condi- tion to
which the peasants of France had been reduced by the wars and taxes of
the reign:</p>
<p>Certains animaux far ouches, des males et des femelles, repandus par
la campagne , noirs, livides , et tout brules du soleil , attaches a la
terre qu’ils fouillent et qu’ils remuent avec une opinidtrete
invincible; ils ont comme une voix articulee &gt; et quand ils se levent
sur leurs pieds , ils montrent une face humaine; et en effet ils sont
des hommes .*</p>
<p>That page has remained a locus classicus in France’s classic age.</p>
<p>X. FOR GOOD MEASURE</p>
<p>Shall we now, exhausted, jumble together in a cowardly appendix some
Im- mortals who are beginning to die?</p>
<p>There is Jean Chapelain, who helped to organize the French Academy,
and was considered in his day (1595-1674) the greatest poet in France.
There is Jean Baptiste Rousseau, who wrote forgettable poetry, but such
biting epigrams that he was banished from France (1712) for defamations
of character. Almost every noble active in politics wrote memoirs; we
have seen those of de Retz and La Rochefoucauld, and will come later to
those of Saint-Simon; only next to these are the three volumes in which
Mme. de Motteville recorded, with charm- ing modesty, her twenty-two
years at the court of Anne of Austria. We note that she agreed with La
Rochefoucauld : “The hard experience I have had of the fictitious
friendship of human beings has forced me to believe that there is
nothing so rare in this world as probity, or a good heart capable of
gratitude.” 105 She was such a rarity.</p>

<p>Madame Henrietta, sent him to the Bastille. He was released after a
year on condition of retiring to his estate; there, fretting to the end
of his days, he com- posed his lively Memoires. Even more untrustworthy
are the Historiettes in which Tallemant des Reaux drew malicious
vignettes of celebrities in literature or affairs. Claude Fleury, with
his conscientious Histoire ecclesiastique (1691), and Sebastien de
Tillemont, with his Histoire des empereurs (i69of.), and his
sixteen-volume Memoires pour servir a V histoire ecclesiastique des six
premiers siecles (1693), labored painstakingly, unwittingly, to clear
the wilderness for Gibbon’s Decl ine and Fall of the Roman Empire (177
6f.).</p>
<p>And there is, last of all, Charles de Marquetel, Seigneur de
Saint-£vremond. He was the most genial of those esprits forts who
shocked Catholics and Hugue- nots, Jesuits and Jansenists alike by
questioning the basic doctrines of their common faith. His adventurous
military career was leading him toward a mar- shal’s baton when he fell
into disfavor as a friend of Fouquet and a critic of Mazarin. Learning
that he was scheduled for arrest, he fled to Holland, and then (1662) to
England. His fine manners and skeptical wit made him a favorite in the
London salon of Hortense Mancini, and at the court of Charles II. Like
the Marechal d’Hocquincourt in one of his merriest dialogues, 106 he
loved war best, women next, philosophy third. Having sipped all the
delights in Montaigne and studied Epicurus with Gassendi, he concluded
with the maligned Greek that sense pleasure is good but intellectual
pleasure better, and that we need as little concern ourselves with the
gods as they seem to do with us. To eat well and write well appeared to
him a reasonable combination. In 1666 he visited Holland again, met
Spinoza, and was deeply impressed by the Christian life of the pantheist
Jew. 107 A pension from the English government, added to the salvaged
remnants of his fortune, enabled him to write a long series of minor
works, all in a style of airy grace that shared in forming Voltaire. His
Reflexions sur les divers genie s du peuple romain helped Montesquieu,
and his correspond- ence with Ninon de Lenclos made part of the
fragrance that permeates French letters. On reaching the age of
fifty-eight, and unaware that he had thirty-two years of life still
before him, he described himself as irremediably in firm. “With - out M.
Descartes’ philosophy, which says, ‘I think, therefore I am,’ I should
scarcely believe myself to be; that is all the benefit I have received
from study- ing that famous man.” 108 He almost rivaled Fontenelle in
longevity, dying in 1703 at the age of ninety; and he achieved for a
Frenchman the rare distinction of being buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>“Some centuries hence,” wrote Frederick the Great to Voltaire, “they
will translate the good authors of the time of Louis XIV as we translate
those of the age of Pericles and of Augustus.” 109 Long before the King
was dead many Frenchmen had already compared the art and literature of
the reign to that of the ancient best. In 1687 Charles Perrault (brother
of the Claude Perrault who had designed the eastern facade of the
Louvre) read to the French Academy a poem, Le Siecle de Louis le Grand ,
in which he ranked his own time above any period in the history of
Greece or Rome.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Though Perrault included Boileau among the contemporaries whom he
considered superior to their classic analogues, the old critic leaped to
the defense of antiquity, and told the Academy it was a shame to listen
to such nonsense. Racine tried to smother the fire by pretending that
Perrault was jesting, 110 but Perrault felt that he had a remunerative
point. He returned to the battle in 1688 with Paralleles des Anciens et
des Modernes, a long but lively dialogue upholding the superiority of
the modems in architecture, painting, oratory, and poetry — except for
the Aeneid, which he thought finer than the Iliad, the Odyssey, or any
other epic. Fontenelle supported him brilliantly, but La Bruyfere, La
Fontaine, and Fenelon sided with Boileau.</p>
<p>It was a healthy quarrel; it marked the end of the Christian and
medieval theory of degeneration, and of Renaissance and humanist
humility before ancient poetry, philosophy, and art. It was generally
agreed that science had now advanced beyond any stage reached in Greece
or Rome; even Boileau admitted this; and the court of Louis XIV readily
conceded that the art of life had never been so beautifully developed as
at Marly and Versailles. We shall not pretend to decide the issue; let
us put it aside until all phases of this age, in all Europe, have been
passed in review. We need not believe that Corneille was superior to
Sophocles, or Racine to Euripides, or Bossuet to Demosthenes, or Boileau
to Horace; we should hardly equate the Louvre with the Parthenon, or
Girardon and Coysevox with Pheidias and Praxiteles. But it is pleasant
to know that these preferences are de- batable, and that those ancient
models are not beyond rivalry.</p>
<p>Voltaire called the reign of Louis XIV “the most enlightened age
the</p>
<p>wo rld has ever seen,” 111 not anticipating that his own epoch would
be named “the Enlightenment.” We should have to moderate his eulogy.
Officially it was an age of obscurantism and intolerance, capped by the
Revocation of the humane Edict of Nantes; “enlightenment” was the pos -
session of a small minority discountenanced by the court and sometimes
disgraced by epicurean excess. Education was controlled by a clergy
dedi- cated to the medieval creed. Freedom of the press was hardly
dreamed of; freedom of speech was a clandestine audacity amid enveloping
censorship. There had been more initiative and spirit, more birth of
genius, under Richelieu than under the Great King. The age was unrivaled
in the royal patronage and eloquent servility of literature and art.
Both the art and the literature touched grandeur, as in the Louvre
Colonnade and Andromaque; sometimes they fell into the grandiose, as in
the Palace of Versailles or the rhetoric of the later Corneille. There
was something artificial in the tragic drama and major arts of the
period; they leaned too heavily upon Greek, Roman, or Renaissance
models; they took their subjects from an alien antiquity rather than
from the history, faith, and character of France; they</p>
<p>CHAP. V) CLASSIC ZENITH IN FRENCH LITERATURE 163</p>
<p>expressed the classical education of an exclusive caste rather than
the life and soul of the people. Hence, amid all that gilded galaxy, the
plebeian Moliere and La Fontaine are most alive today, because they
forgot Greece and Rome and remembered France. The classic age cleansed
the language, chiseled the literature, gave grace to speech, and taught
passion to reason; but also it chilled French (and English) poetry for
almost a century after the great reign.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was a great reign. Never in history had a ruler been
so generous to science, letters, and the arts. Louis XIV persecuted
Jansenists and Huguenots, but it was under him that Pascal wrote,
Bossuet preached, and Fenelon taught. He conscripted art to his purpose
and glory, but with his nourishment it gave France magnificent
architecture, sculpture, and painting. He protected Moliere against a
swarm of enemies, and supported Racine from tragedy to tragedy. Never
did France write better drama, better letters, or better prose. The
King’s good manners, his self -control, his patience, his respect for
women, helped to spread a charming courtesy through the court, into
Paris and France and Europe. He misused some women, but it was under his
rule that women reached a status, in literature and life, that gave
France a bisexual culture lovelier than any other in the world. After
making every discount, and regretting that so much beauty was tarnished
with so much cruelty, we may join the French in acclaiming the age of
Louis XIV as standing with Periclean Greece, Augustan Rome, Renaissance
Italy, and Elizabethan- Jacobean England among the peaks in the
faltering trajectory of mankind.</p>
