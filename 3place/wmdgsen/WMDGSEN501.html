<h4 id="chapter-xxxii">CHAPTER XXXII</h4>
<p>The Jews</p>
<p>1300-1564</p>
<p>I. THE WANDERERS</p>
<p>I N his Flores Historiarum (1228) Roger Wendover told of an Armenian
archbishop who, visiting the monastery of St. Albans early in the thir-
teenth century, was asked about the story that a Jew who had talked with
Christ was still alive in the Near East. The archbishop assured the
monks that the story was true. His attendant added that the archbishop
had dined with this immortal only a short time before leaving Armenia;
that the man’s name, Latin-wise, was Cartophilus; that when Jesus was
leaving the tribunal of Pontius Pilate this Cartophilus struck the Lord
in the back, saying, “Go faster”; and that Jesus said to him, “I go, but
thou shalt tarry till I come.” Other Armenians, visiting St. Albans in
1252, repeated the tale. Popular fiction expanded it, varied the name of
the wanderer, and told how, every hundred years or so, he fell into a
grave illness and deep coma, from which he recovered as a youth with
memories still fresh of the trial, death, and resurrection of Christ.
The story sank out of record for a while, but re- appeared in the
sixteenth century; and excited Europeans claimed to have seen Ahasuerus
— as der evnge Jude or le Juif errant was now called — at Ham- burg
(1547 and 1564), Vienna (i599),Liibeck (1601), Paris (1644), New- castle
(1790), finally in Utah (1868). The legend of the Wandering Jew was
welcomed, in a Europe that was losing its faith, as a reassuring proof
of the divinity and resurrection of Christ, and a fresh pledge of His
second coming. For us the myth is a somber symbol of a people losing its
homeland in the seventy-first year of the Christian era, wandering for
eighteen cen- turies over four continents, and suffering repeated
crucifixions, before re- gaining its ancient habitation in the unstable
flux of our time. 1</p>
<p>The Jews of the Dispersion found least misery under the sultans
in</p>
<p>Turkey and the popes in France and Italy. Jewish minorities lived
safely in Constantinople, Salonika, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine,
Arabia, Egypt, North Africa, and Moorish Spain. The Berbers gave them a
reluctant toler- ation, yet Simon Duran led a flourishing settlement in
Algeria. In Alexandria the Jewish community, as described by Rabbi
Obadiah Bertinoro in 1488,</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII )</p>
<p>721</p>
<p>lived well, drank too much wine, sat cross-legged on carpets like the
Mos- lems, and removed their shoes before entering the synagogue or the
home of a friend. 2 German Jews finding refuge in Turkey wrote back to
their rela- tives enthusiastic descriptions of the happy conditions
enjoyed there by the Jews. 3 In Palestine the Ottoman pasha allowed the
Jews to build a synagogue on the slope of Mt. Zion. Some Western Jews
made pilgrimages to Palestine, holding it good fortune to die in the
Holy Land, and best of all in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the center and zest of Jewish thought in this age were
in the unforgiving West. There they were least unfortunate in
enlightened Italy. In Naples they enjoyed the friendship of King Robert
of Anjou. They pros- pered in Ancona, Ferrara, Padua, Venice, Verona,
Mantua, Florence, Pisa, and other hives of the Renaissance. “Italy has
many Jews,” said Erasmus in</p>
<p>151 8; “Spain hardly any Christians.” 4 Commerce and finance were
respected in Italy, and the Jews who served those necessities were
valued as stimulating agents in the economy. The old requirement that
Jews should wear a dis- tinguishing badge or garment was generally
ignored in the peninsula; well- to-do Jews dressed like the Italians of
their class. Jewish youths attended the universities, and an increasing
number of Christians studied Hebrew.</p>
<p>Occasionally some holy hater like St. John of Capistrano would excite
his hearers to demand the full enforcement of all “blue law” canonical
disabili - ties against the Jews; but though Capistrano was supported by
Popes Euge- nius IV and Nicholas V, the effect of his eloquence was
transient in Italy. Another Franciscan friar, Bernardino of Feltre,
attacked the Jews so vocif- erously that the civic authorities of Milan,
Ferrara, and Venice ordered him to be silent or decamp. When a
three-year-old child was found dead near the house of a Jew in Trent
(1475), Bernardino proclaimed that the Jews had murdered it. The bishop
had all the Jews in Trent imprisoned, and some, under duress of torture,
said that they had slain the boy and drunk his blood as part of a
Passover ritual. All the Jews in Trent were burned to death. The corpse
of “little Simon” was embalmed and displayed as a saintly relic; thou -
sands of simple believers made pilgrimages to the new shrine; and the
story of the alleged atrocity, spreading over the Alps into Germany,
intensified antisemitic feeling there. The Venetian Senate denounced the
tale as a pious fraud, and ordered the authorities within Venetian
jurisdiction to protect the Jews. Two lawyers came from Padua to Trent
to examine the evidence; they were nearly torn to pieces by the
populace. Pope Sixtus IV was urged to canonize Simon, but he refused,
and forbade honoring him as a saint; s however, Simon was beatified in 1
582.</p>
<p>In Rome the Jews for centuries enjoyed fairer conditions of life
and</p>
<p>liberty than anywhere else in Christendom, partly because the popes
were usually men of culture, partly because the city was ruled and
divided by Orsini and Colonna factions too busy fighting each other to
spare hostility</p>
<p>722 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>to others, and perhaps because the Romans were too close to the
business side of Christianity to take their religion fanatically. There
was as yet no ghetto in Rome; most of its Jews lived in the Septus
Hebraicus on the left bank of the Tiber, but they did not have to;
palaces of the Roman aristoc- racy rose amid Jewish dwellings, and
synagogues near Christian churches. 6 Some oppression remained: the Jews
were taxed to support the athletic games, and were forced to send
representatives to take part in them, half naked, against Jewish customs
and tastes. Racial antagonism survived. Jews were caricatured on the
Roman stage and in Carnival farces, but Jewesses were regularly
presented as gentle and beautiful; note the contrast between Barabas and
Abigail in Marlowe’s Jew of Malta, and between Shylock and Jessica in
The Merchant of Venice.</p>
<p>By and large the popes were as generous to the Jews as could be
expected of men who honored Christ as the Messiah and resented the
Jewish belief that the Messiah had not yet come. In establishing the
Inquisition the popes exempted unconverted Jews from its jurisdiction;
it could summon such Jews only for attacks on Christianity, or for
attempts to convert a Chris- tian to Judaism. “Jews who never ceased
professing Judaism were, on the whole, left undisturbed” 7 by the
Church, though not by the state or the populace. Several popes issued
bulls aiming to mitigate popular hostility. Pope Clement VI labored in
this regard, and made papal Avignon a merciful haven for Jews fleeing
from the predatory government of France. 8 Martin V, in 1419, proclaimed
to the Catholic world:</p>
<p>Whereas the Jews are made in the image of God, and a remnant</p>
<p>will one day be saved, and whereas they have besought our protec-
tion: following in the footsteps of our predecessors, we command</p>
<p>that they be not molested in their synagogues; that their laws,</p>
<p>rights, and customs be not assailed; that they be not baptized by
force, constrained to observe Christian festivals, nor to wear new
badges,</p>
<p>and that they be not hindered in their business relations with Chris-
tians. 9</p>
<p>Eugenius IV and Nicholas, as we shall see, issued repressive
legislation; but for the rest, says Graetz, “among the masters of Italy,
the popes were most friendly to the Jews.” 10 Several of them— Alexander
VI, Julius II, Leo X — ignoring old decrees, entrusted their lives to
Jewish physicians. Contempo- rary Jewish writers celebrated gratefully
the security enjoyed by their people under the Medici popes, 11 and one
of them called Clement VII “the</p>
<p>This was the heyday of the Renaissance period, and a succession</p>
<p>of cultured, polished, luxurious, worldly-wise popes in Rome re-</p>
<p>garded the promotion of culture as being as important a part of

<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>7 X 3</p>
<p>function as the forwarding of the religious interests of the
Catholic</p>
<p>Church They tended, therefore, from the middle of the fifteenth</p>
<p>century onward, to overlook inconvenient details of canon law and</p>
<p>to show … a wide tolerance for those who were not Catholic. The</p>
<p>Jewish loan-bankers constituted an integral part of the economic</p>
<p>machinery of their dominions, while as broad-minded men of the</p>
<p>world they appreciated the conversation of Jewish physicians and</p>
<p>others with whom they came into contact. Hence the persecutory</p>
<p>regulations that had been elaborated by the Fathers of the
Church,</p>
<p>and codified by the Third and Fourth Lateran Councils, were
almost</p>
<p>entirely neglected by them With this example before their eyes,</p>
<p>the other Italian princes — the Medici of Florence, the Estensi
of</p>
<p>Ferrara, the Gonzaga of Mantua — acted in much the same fashion.</p>
<p>Though they were disturbed by occasional interludes of violence
or</p>
<p>fanaticism — as for example when Savonarola obtained control of</p>
<p>Florence in 1497 — the Jews mixed with their neighbors and shared</p>
<p>in their life to a degree that was almost unexampled. They played
a</p>
<p>distinct part in certain aspects of the Renaissance. . . . They
mirrored it in their own lives and in their literary activities in the
Hebrew</p>
<p>tongue; they made important contributions to philosophy, music, and
the theater; they were familiar figures in many of the Italian courts.
13</p>
<p>Some once famous figures illustrate these bright days in the
relations of Christians and Jews. Immanuel ben Solomon Haromi (i.e., of
Rome) was born in the same year as Dante (1265), and became his friend.
He was as much a Renaissance man as a loyal Jew could be: physician by
profession, preacher, Biblical scholar, grammarian, scientist, man of
wealth and affairs, poet, and “writer of frivolous songs that very often
passed the bounds of decency.” 14 A complete master of Hebrew, he
introduced the sonnet form into that language; he almost rivaled the
Italians in fluency and spirit, and not again before Heine would a
Jewish poet show such talent for satire, such brilliance and wit.
Perhaps Immanuel had imbibed some of the Aver- roist skepticism of the
age; one of his poems expresses a distaste for heaven with all its
virtuous people (he thought only ugly women were virtuous), and a
preference for hell, where he expected to find the most tempting
beauties of all time. In his old age he composed a weak imitation of
Dante — Topheth we-Eden (Heaven and Paradise); in Judaism, as in
Protestantism, there was no purgatory. More generous than Dante,
Immanuel, following Rabbinical tradition, ad mitted into heaven all “the
righteous of the nations of the world”; 15 however, he condemned
Aristotle to hell for teaching the eternity of the universe.</p>
<p>A similar spirit of lighthearted humor gave tang and verve to the
writings of Kalonymos ben Kalonymos. King Robert of Naples, on a visit
to Prov- ence, noticed the young scholar of the Beautiful Name, and took
him to</p>
<p>724 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>Italy. At first Kalonymos was all for science and philosophy; he
translated Aristotle, Archimedes, Ptolemy, Galen, al-Farabi, and
Averroes into He- brew, and wrote in a high ethical vein. But he found
the gay mood of Naples easy to assimilate. When he moved to Rome he
became a Jewish Horace, satirizing amiably the faults and foibles of
Christians, Jews, and himself. He mourned that he had been born a man;
had he been a woman he would not have had to pore over the Bible and the
Talmud, or to learn the 613 precepts of the Law. His Purim Tractate made
fun of the Talmud, and the popularity of this satire among the Roman
Jews suggests that they were not as pious as their more unhappy brethren
in other lands.</p>
<p>The Renaissance revived not only Greek but Hebrew studies. Cardinal
Egidio de Viterbo invited Elijah Levita from Germany to Rome ( 1 509) ;
for thirteen years the Jewish scholar lived in the Cardinal’s palace as
an honored guest, teaching Egidio Hebrew, and receiving instruction in
Greek. Through the efforts of Egidio, Reuchlin, and other Christian
pupils of Jewish teachers, chairs of Hebrew were established in several
Italian universities or academies. Elijah del Medigo, who taught Hebrew
at Padua, was so highly regarded there, despite his refusal of
conversion, that when a violent controversy broke out among the
Christian students over a problem in scholarship the university
authorities and the Venetian Senate appointed Del Medigo to arbitrate,
which he did with such erudition and tact that all parties were
satisfied. Pico della Mirandola invited him to teach Hebrew in Florence.
There Elijah joined the humanist circle of the Medici, and we may still
see him among the figures painted by Benozzo Gozzoli on the Medici
palace walls. The scholar gave no encouragement to Pico’s notion of
finding Chris - tian dogmas in the Cabala; on the contrary, he ridiculed
that apocalypse as a heap of stupefying absurdities.</p>
<p>North of the Alps the Jews were less fortunate than in Italy. They
were expelled from England in 1290, from France in 1306, from Flanders
in 1370. France recalled them in 1315 on condition of giving to the king
two thirds of any money they might collect on loans made before their
expulsion; 16 when the royal profits on these operations ended the Jews
were banished again (1321). They returned in time to be blamed for the
Black Death, and were again exiled (1349). They were recalled (1360) to
lend financial aid and skill in raising sums to ransom the captured
French king from England. But in 1394 an Israelite converted to
Christianity mysteriously disappeared; the Jews were accused of killing
him; some tortured Jews confessed that they had advised the convert to
return to Judaism; public opinion was in- flamed, and Charles VI
reluctantly ordered another banishment of the harassed race.</p>
<p>There was a substantial community of Jews in Prague. Some of them
went</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE JEWS 725</p>
<p>to hear the sermons of Huss’s forerunner Milicz because he showed so
much knowledge and appreciation of the Old Testament. Huss studied
Hebrew, read Hebrew commentaries, and quoted Rashi and Maimonides. The
Tabo- rites who carried Huss’s reforms close to communism called
themselves the Chosen People, and gave the names Edom, Moab, and Amalek
to the Ger- man provinces against which they waged war. The Hussite
armies, however, were not averse to killing Jews; when they captured
Prague (1421) they gave them not the Mohammedan choice of conversion or
taxation, but the simpler choice of apostasy or death. 17</p>
<p>Of all the Christian states Poland was second only to Italy in
hospitality to the Jews. In 1098, 1 146, and 1 196 many Jews migrated
from Germany to Poland to avoid death at the hands of Crusaders. They
were well received, and prospered; by 1207 some of them owned large
estates. In 1264 King Boleslav the Pious gave them a charter of civil
rights. After the Black Death more Germans moved to Poland, and were
welcomed by the ruling aristoc- racy as a progressive economic ferment
in a nation still lacking a middle class. Casimir III the Great
(1333-70) confirmed and extended the rights of the Polish Jews, and the
Grand Duke Vitovst guaranteed these rights to the Jews of Lithuania. But
in 1407 a priest told his congregation at Cracow that Jews had killed a
Christian boy and had gloated over his blood; the charge provoked a
massacre. Casimir IV renewed and again enlarged the liberties of the
Jews ( 1447) ; “we desire,” he said, “that the Jews, whom we</p>
<ol start="1494" type="1">
<li>Perhaps to prevent such attacks, the Jews of Cracow were thereafter
required to live in a suburb, Kazimierz.</li>
</ol>
<p>There, and in other Polish or Lithuanian centers, the Jews,
overcoming all obstacles, grew in number and prosperity. Under Sigismund
I their liberties were restored, except of residence; and they remained
in favor with Sigismund II. In 1556 three Jews in the town of Sokhachev
were charged with having stabbed a consecrated Host and made it bleed;
they protested their innocence, but were burned at the stake by order of
the bishop of Khelm. Sigismund II denounced the accusation as a “pious
fraud” designed to prove to Jews and Protestants that the consecrated
bread had really been changed into the body and blood of Christ. “I am
shocked by this hideous villainy.” said the King; “nor am I sufficiently
devoid of common sense as to</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>726</p>
<p>believe that there could be any blood in the Host.” 19 But with the
death of this skeptical ruler ( 1572) the era of good feelings between
the government and the Jews of Poland came to an end.</p>
<p>For a time the Jews lived peaceably in medieval Germany. They func-
tioned actively along the great river avenues of trade, in the free
cities and the ports; even archbishops asked Imperial permission to
harbor Jews. By the Golden Bull (1355) the Emperor Charles IV shared
with the Imperial electors the privilege of having Jews as serin earner
ae — servants of the cham- ber; i.e., the electors were empowered to
receive Jews into their dominions, protect them, use them, and mulct
them. In Germany, as in Italy, students eager to understand the Old
Testament at first hand learned Hebrew; the conflict between Reuchlin
and Pfefferkorn stimulated this study; and the first complete printing
of the Talmud (1520) provided further impetus.</p>
<p>The influence of Judaism culminated in the Reformation. Theologically
this was a reversion to the simpler creed and severer ethic of early
Judaic Christianity. Protestant hostility to religious pictures and
statuary was, of course, a return to the Semit ic antipathy to “graven
images”; some Protes - tant sects observed Saturday as the Sabbath; the
rejection of “Mariolatry” and the worship of saints approached the
strict monotheism of the Jews; and the new ministers, accepting sex and
marriage, resembled the rabbis rather than the Catholic priests. Critics
of the Reformers accused them of “Judaizing,” called them semi - Judaei,
“half - Jews”; 20 Carlstadt himself said that Melanchthon wanted to go
back to Moses; Calvin included Judaizing among the deadly sins of
Servetus, and the Spaniard admitted that his He- brew studies had
influenced him in questioning the trinitarian theology. Cal- vin’s rule
in Geneva recalled the dominance of the priesthood in ancient Israel.
Zwingli was denounced as a Judaizer because he studied Hebrew with Jews
and based many of his sermons and commentaries on the Hebrew text of the
Old Testament. He confessed himself enchanted by the Hebrew lan-
guage:</p>
<p>I found the Holy Tongue beyond all belief cultivated, graceful,</p>
<p>and dignified. Although it is poor in the number of words, yet
its</p>
<p>lack is not felt because it makes use of its store in so manifold a
fashion. Indeed, I may dare to say that if one conceives its dignity and
grace, no other language expresses so much with so few words and so
power- ful expressions; no language is so rich in many-sided and
meaningful . . . modes of imagery. No language so delights and quickens
the</p>
<p>human heart . 21</p>
<p>Luther was not so enthusiastic. “How I hate people,” he complained,
“who lug in so many languages as Zwingli does; he spoke Greek and
Hebrew</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>727</p>
<p>the Jews as if he had never learned anything from them; no man is a
hero to his debtor. In a pamphlet “Concerning the Jews and Their Lies”
(1542) he discharged a volley of arguments against the Jews: that they
had refused to accept Christ as God, that their age- long sufferings
proved God’s hatred of them, that they were intruders in Christian
lands, that they were insolent in their usurious prosperity, that the
Talmud sanctioned the deception, rob- bery, and killing of Christians,
that they poisoned springs and wells, and murdered Christian children to
use their blood in Jewish rituals. We have seen, in studying his aging
character, how he advised the Germans to bum down the homes of Jews, to
close their synagogues and schools, to confiscate their wealth, to
conscript their men and women to forced labor, and to give all Jews a
choice between Christianity and having their tongues torn out. In a
sermon delivered shortly before his death he added that Jewish physi-
cians were deliberately poisoning Christians. 23 These utterances helped
to make Protestantism — so indebted to Judaism — more antisemitic than
official Catholicism, though not more so than the Catholic populace.
They in- fluenced the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg to expel the
Jews from those territories. 24 They set the tone in Germany for
centuries, and prepared its people for genocidal holocausts.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ON THE RACK</li>
</ol>
<p>Why did Christians and Jews hate each other? Doubtless a pervasive
and continuing reason was a vital conflict in religious creeds. The Jews
were a perennial challenge to the fundamental tenets of
Christianity.</p>
<p>This religious hostility led to a racial segregation at first
voluntary, later compulsory, issuing in the establishment of the first
ghetto in 1516. The segregation accentuated differences of dress, ways,
features, worship, and speech; these differences encouraged mutual
distrust and fear; this fear generated hate. The Jews turned into a
glory their usual exclusion from mar- riage with Christians; their pride
of race boasted of descent from kings who had ruled Israel a thousand
years before Christ. They scorned the Christians as superstitious
polytheists, a little slow of mind, mouthing gentle hypoc- risies amid
merciless brutalities, worshiping a Prince of Peace and repeatedly
waging fratricidal wars. The Christians scorned the Jews as outlandish
and unprepossessing infidels. Thomas More told of a pious lady who was
shocked to learn that the Virgin was a Jewess, and who confessed that
thereafter she would be unable to love the Mother of God as fervently as
before. 25</p>
<p>The theory of the Eucharist became a tragedy for the Jews. Christians
were required to believe that the priest transformed the wafer of
unleavened bread into the body and blood of Christ; some Christians,
like the Lollards</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>728</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>doubted it; stories of consecrated wafers bleeding at the prick of a
knife or a pin could strengthen belief; and who would do so horrible a
deed but a Jew? Such legends of a bleeding Host were plentiful in late
medieval cen- turies. In several cases, as at Neuburg (near Passau) in
1338, and at Brussels in 1369, the allegations led to the murder of Jews
and the burning of their homes. In Brussels a chapel was set up in the
cathedral of St. Gudule to commemorate the bleeding Host of 1 369, and
the miracle was annually cele- brated with a festival that became the
Flemish Kermess. 26 In Neuburg a clerk confessed that he had dipped an
unconsecrated Host in blood, had hidden it in a church, and had accused
the Jews of stabbing it. 2T It should be added that enlightened
ecclesiastics like Nicholas of Cusa condemned as shameful cruelties the
legends of Jewish attacks on the Host.</p>
<p>Economic rivalries hid behind religious hostility. While the papal
prohi- bition of interest was respected among Christians, the Jews
acquired almost a monopoly of moneylending in Christendom. When
Christian bankers ignored the taboo, firms like the Bardi, Pitti, and
Strozzi in Florence, the Welsers, Hochstetters, and Fuggers in Augsburg,
rose to challenge this monopoly, and a new focus of irritation formed.
Both Christian and Jewish bankers charged high interest rates,
reflecting the risks of lending money in an unstable economy rendered
more unstable by rising prices and debased currencies. Jewish lenders
ran greater risks than their competitors: the col- lection of debts owed
by Christians to Jews was uncertain and hazardous; ecclesiastical
authorities might declare a moratorium on debts as in the Cru- sades;
kings might, and did, lay confiscatory taxes upon Jews, or force “loans”
from them, or expel the Jews and absolve their debtors, or exact a share
in permitted collections. North of the Alps nearly all classes except
businessmen still regarded interest as usury, and condemned the Jewish
bankers especially when borrowing from them. Since the Jews were gener-
ally the most experienced financiers, they were in several countries
employed by the kings to manage the finances of the state; and the sight
of rich Jews holding lucrative posts and collecting taxes from the
people inflamed popular resentment.</p>
<p>Even so, some Christian communities welcomed Jewish bankers. Frank-
furt offered them special privileges on condition that they would charge
only 32 y 2 per cent, while their rate to others was 43 per cent. 28
This seems shocking, but we hear of Christian moneylenders charging up
to 266 per cent; the Holzschuhers of Nuremberg charged 220 per cent in
1304; the Christian lenders in Brindisi charged 240 per cent. 29 We hear
of towns call- ing for the return of Jewish bankers as more lenient than
their Christian counterparts. Ravenna stipulated, in a treaty with
Venice, that Jewish fin- anciers should be sent to it to open credit
banks for the promotion of agri- culture and industry. 80</p>

<p>Nationalism added another note to the hymn of hate. Each nation
thought it needed ethnic and religious unity, and demanded the
absorption or con- version of its Jews. Several Church councils, and
some popes, were aggres- sively hostile. The Council of Vienne ( 1 3 1 1
) forbade all intercourse between Christians and Jews. The Council of
Zamora (1313) ruled that they must be kept in strict subjection and
servitude. The Council of Basel (143 1 —</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>renewed canonical decrees forbidding Christians to associate with
Jews, to serve them, or to use them as physicians, and instructed
secular authorities to confine the Jews in separate quarters, compel
them to wear a distinguish- ing badge, and ensure their attendance at
sermons aimed to convert them. 31 Pope Eugenius IV, at war with the
Council of Basel, dared not be outdone by it in troubling the Jews; he
confirmed the disabilities decreed by that Council, and added that Jews
should be ineligible for any public office, could not inherit property
from Christians, must build no more synagogues, and must stay in their
homes, behind closed doors and windows, in Passion Week (a wise
provision against Christian violence) ; moreover, the testimony of Jews
against Christians should have no validity in law. Eugenius com- plained
that some Jews spoke scandalously about Jesus and Mary, and this was
probably true; 32 hatred begot hate. In a later bull Eugenius ordered
that any Italian Jew found reading Talmudic literature should suffer
con- fiscation of his property. Pope Nicholas V commissioned St. John of
Capis- trano ( 1447) to see to it that every clause of this repressive
legislation should be enforced, and authorized him to seize the property
of any Jewish physi- cian who treated a Christian. 33</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite such edicts the general Christian public behaved toward the
Jews with the good nature that actuates nearly all men, women, and
animals when their purposes are not crossed. But there could be found in
most communi- ties a minority not averse to practicing cruelty when this
might be done with collective impunity. So the Pastoureaux, originating
as shepherds bound for the Holy Land, but attracting riffraff as they
passed through France (1320), decided to kill en route all Jews refusing
to be baptized. At Toulouse 500 Jews sought refuge in a tower; they were
besieged by a wild mob, which gave them a choice between baptism or
death. The governor of the city tried in vain to rescue them. Finding
resistance impossible, the fugitives instructed the strongest among them
to slay them; in this way, we are told, all but one died; and the
survivor, though offering to submit to baptism, was torn to pieces by
the crowd. In like manner all the Jews of 1 20 communities in south- ern
France and northern Spain were blotted out, leaving only some destitute
remnants. 34 In 1321, on a charge of poisoning wells, 120 Jews were
burned near Chinon. 35 In 1336 a German fanatic announced that he had
received a revelation from God commanding him to avenge the death of
Christ by killing Jews. He gathered a following of 5,000 peasants, who
called them-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>730</p>
<p>selves Armleder from a leather band worn on the arm; they ranged
through Alsace and the Rhineland, killing all the Jews they could find.
A murderous mania swept through Bavaria, Bohemia, Moravia, and Austria
(1337). Pope Benedict XII tried in vain to stop it, but only in Ratisbon
and Vienna were the Jews effectively protected; elsewhere thousands were
tortured and killed. 36</p>
<p>The Black Death was a special tragedy for the Jews of Christendom.
The same plague had slain Mongols, Moslems, and Jews in Asia, where no
one thought of blaming the Jews; but in Western Europe a populace
maddened by the ravages of the pestilence accused the Jews of poisoning
the wells in an attempt to wipe out all Christians. Fevered imaginations
brewed details: the Jews of Toledo, it was said, had dispatched agents
with boxes of poison, made from lizards and basilisks and Christian
hearts, to all the Jewish communities in Europe, with instructions to
drop these concentrations into wells and springs. The Emperor Charles IV
denounced the charge as absurd; so did Pope Clement VI; 37 many
burgomasters and municipal councils spoke to the same effect, which was
little indeed. A false belief spread among the Christians that the Jews
were rarely touched by the plague. In some cities — perhaps through
differences in hygienic laws or medical care — the fever did seem less
fatal to them than to the Christians; 38 but in many places — e.g.,
Vienna, Ratisbon, Avignon, Rome — the Jews suffered equally. 39
Neverthe- less some Jews were tortured into confessing that they had
distributed the poison. 40 Christians closed their wells and springs,
and drank rain water or melted snow. Merciless pogroms broke out in
France, Spain, and Germany. In one town in southern France the entire
Jewish community was cast into the flames. All Jews in Savoy, all Jews
around Lake Leman, all in Bern, Fri- bourg, Basel, Nuremberg, Brussels,
were burned. Clement VI a second time denounced the horror and the
charge, declared the Jews innocent, and pointed out that the plague was
as severe where no Jews lived as anywhere else; he admonished the clergy
to restrain their parishioners, and excom- municated all persons who
killed or falsely accused Jews. In Strasbourg, however, the bishop
joined in the accusation, and persuaded the reluctant municipal council
to banish all Jews. The populace thought this measure too mild; it drove
out the council and installed another, which ordered the arrest of all
Jews in the city. Some escaped to the countryside; many of these were
killed by the peasantry. Two thousand Jews left in the city were jailed,
and were commanded to accept baptism; half of them submitted, the rest
refused and were burned (February 14, 1439). All in all, some 510 Jewish
com- munities were exterminated in Christian Europe as a result of these
po- groms; 41 many more were decimated; in Saragossa, for example, only
one Jew out of five survived the Black Death persecutions. 42 Lea
estimated 3,000 Jews killed at Erfurt, 12,000 in Bavaria. 43 In Vienna,
on the advice of Rabbi</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>731</p>
<p>Jonah, all the Jews gathered in their synagogue and killed
themselves; similar mass suicides occurred in Worms, Oppenheim, Krems,
and Frankfurt. 44 A panic of flight carried thousands of Jews from
Western Europe into Poland or Turkey. It would be hard to find, before
our time, or in all the records of savagery, any deeds more barbarous
than the collective murder of Jews in the Black Death.</p>
<p>Slowly the surviving Jews of Germany crept back to the cities that
had despoiled them, and rebuilt their synagogues. But they were all the
more hated for having been wronged. In 1385 all thirty-six towns of the
Swabian League imprisoned their Jews, and released them only on
condition that all debts owed them should be canceled; this was
especially satisfactory to Nuremberg, which had borrowed 7,000 pounds
from them (00,000?) 45 In 1389 a number of Jews were massacred on a
charge that they had dese- crated a consecrated Host; on the same excuse
fourteen Jews were burned in Posen ( r 399). 40 For diverse reasons the
Jews were expelled from Cologne (1424), Speyer (1435), Strasbourg and
Augsburg (1439), Wurzburg</p>
<p>(1453), Erfurt (1458), Mainz (1470), Nuremberg (1498), Ulm (1499).
Maximilian I sanctioned their expulsion from Nuremberg on the ground
that “they had become so numerous, and through their usurious dealings
they had become possessed of all the property of many respectable
citizens, and had dragged them into misery and dishonor.” 47 In 1446 all
Jews in the mark of Brandenburg were imprisoned, and their goods were
confiscated, on charges which Bishop Stephen of Brandenburg scored as a
cover for greed: “Those princes have acted iniquitously who, prompted by
inordinate avarice, and without just cause, have seized on certain Jews
and thrown them into prison, and refuse to make restitution of that of
which they robbed them.” 48 In 145 1 Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, one of
the most enlightened men of the fifteenth century, enforced the wearing
of badges by the Jews under his jurisdiction. Two years later John of
Capistrano began his missions, as legate of Pope Nicholas V, in Germany,
Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Poland. His power- ful sermons accused
the Jews of killing children and desecrating the Host- charges which
popes had branded as murderous superstitions. Urged on by this “scourge
of the Jews,” the dukes of Bavaria drove all Hebrews from their duchy.
Bishop Godfrey of Wurzburg, who had given them full privi- leges in
Franconia, now banished them, and in town after town Jews were arrested,
and debts due them were annulled. At Breslau several Jews were jailed on
Capistrano’s demand; he himself supervised the tortures that wrung from
some of them whatever he bade them confess; on the basis of these
confessions forty Jews were burned at the stake (June 2, 1453). The re-
maining Jews were banished, but their children were taken from them and
baptized by force. 40 Capistrano was canonized in 1 690.</p>
<p>The tribulations of the Jews in Ratisbon illustrate the age. A
converted</p>
<p>732 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>Jew, Hans Vogel, alleged that Israel Bruna, a seventy-five-year-old
rabbi, had bought from him a Christian child, and had killed it to use
its blood in a Jewish ritual. The populace believed the accusation, and
cried out for the death penalty. The city council, to save the old man
from the crowd, im- prisoned him. Emperor Frederick III ordered him
released. The council dared not obey, but it arrested Vogel, told him
that he must die, and invited him to confess his sins. He admitted that
Bruna was innocent, and the rabbi was freed. But news came to Ratisbon
that Jews under torture had confessed to killing a child in Trent.
Belief in Vogel’s charge rose again. The council ordered the arrest of
all Ratisbon Jews, and the confiscation of all their goods. Frederick
intervened, and laid a fine of 8,000 guilders on the city. The coun- cil
agreed to free the Jews if they would pay this fine and an additional
10,- 000 guilders (50,000?) as bail. They answered that 18,000 guilders
were more than all the property still left them; they could not possibly
raise such a sum. They were kept in jail for two years more, and were
then released on taking oath not to leave Ratisbon and not to seek
revenge. The clergy, however, agitated for their expulsion, and
threatened with excommunication any tradesman who sold goods to Jews. By
1500 only twenty-four families remained, and in 1519 these were
expelled. 50</p>
<p>Their expulsion from Spain has been described above, as vital to the
history of that country. In Portugal their crucifixion was renewed when
Clement VII, at the urging of Charles V, allowed Portuguese prelates to
establish the Inquisition (1531) for the purpose of enforcing the
practice of Christianity upon the novos cristaos — mostly Jews who had
been bap- tized against their will. The severe code of Torquemada was
adopted, spies were set to watch the converts for any relapse into
Jewish religious observ- ances, and thousands of Jews were imprisoned.
Emigration of Jews was prohibited, for their economic functions were
still necessary in the Portu- guese economy. To prevent flight,
Christians were forbidden to buy prop- erty from Jews, and hundreds of
Jews were sent to the stake for attempting to leave the country. Shocked
by these procedures, and perhaps swayed by Jewish gifts, Clement
abrogated the powers of the Portuguese Inquisition, and ordered the
release of its prisoners and the restoration of confiscated goods. His
bull of October 17, 1532, laid down humane principles for deal- ing with
the converts:</p>
<p>Since they were dragged by force to be baptized, they cannot be</p>
<p>considered members of the Church; and to punish them for heresy</p>
<p>and relapse were to violate the principles of justice and equity.
With sons and daughters of the first Marranos the case is different;
they be- long to the Church as voluntary members. But as they have
been</p>
<p>brought up by their relatives in the midst of Judaism, and have
had</p>
<p>this example continually before their eyes, it would be cruel to
pun-</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>733</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII )</p>
<p>ish them according to the canonical law for falling into Jewish
ways</p>
<p>and beliefs; they must be kept in the bosom of the Church through</p>
<p>gentle treatment. 51</p>
<p>That Clement was sincere appears from a brief issued by him on July
26, 1534, when he felt death upon him; it instructed the papal nuncio in
Portugal to hasten the release of imprisoned converts. 52</p>
<p>Pope Paul III continued the efforts to aid the Portuguese Jews, and
1,800 of the prisoners were freed. But when Charles V returned from his
ap- parently successful expedition against Tunis he demanded, as reward,
the restoration of the Inquisition in Portugal. Paul reluctantly agreed
(1536), but with conditions that seemed to King John III to nullify his
consent: the accused must be confronted with the accuser, and the
condemned should have the right of appeal to the pope. A fanatical
convert helped the in- quisitors by placarding Lisbon Cathedral with a
defiant announcement: “The Messiah has not yet appeared; Jesus was not
the Messiah; and Chris - tianity is a lie.” 63 As such a statement was
clearly calculated to injure the Jews, we may reasonably suspect an
agent provocateur . Paul appointed a commission of cardinals to
investigate the procedures of the Portuguese Inquisition. It
reported:</p>
<p>When a pseudo-Christian is denounced — often by false witnesses</p>
<p>— the inquisitors drag him away to a dismal retreat where he is
al-</p>
<p>lowed no sight of heaven or earth, and least of all to speak with
his</p>
<p>friends, who might succor him. They accuse him on obscure testi-</p>
<p>mony, and inform him neither of the time nor the place where he</p>
<p>committed the offense for which he is denounced. Later on he is</p>
<p>allowed an advocate, who often, instead of defending his cause, helps
him on the road to the stake. Let an unfortunate creature acknowl-</p>
<p>edge himself a true believing Christian, and firmly deny the
trans-</p>
<p>gressions laid to his charge, they condemn him to the flames, and</p>
<p>confiscate his goods. Let him plead guilty to such and such a
deed,</p>
<p>though unintentionally committed, they treat him in a similar manner
under the pretense that he obstinately denies his wicked intentions.</p>
<p>Let him freely and fully admit what he is accused of, he is reduced
to extremest necessity, and condemned to the dungeon’s never -lifting
gloom. And this they call treating the accused with mercy and com-</p>
<p>passion and Christian charity! Even he who succeeds in proving
his</p>
<p>innocence is condemned to pay a fine, so that it may not be said that
he was arrested without cause. The accused who are held prisoners are
racked by every instrument of torture to admit the accusations</p>
<p>against them. Many die in prison, and those who are set free, with
all their relatives bear a brand of eternal infamy. 54</p>
<p>Though harassed by political developments, and the danger of losing
Spain and Portugal as Leo had lost Germany and Clement England, Paul did
all</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>734</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>that he could to mitigate the Inquisition. But day by day the terror
went on, until the Portuguese Jews found, by whatever desperate device,
some escape from their hosts, and joined the Jews of Spain in seeking
some corner of Christendom or Islam where they might keep their Law and
yet be allowed to live.</p>
<p>ni. THE SECOND DISPERSION</p>
<p>Where could they go? Sardinia and Sicily, where Jews had lived for a
thousand years past, were included with Spain in Ferdinand’s edict of ex
- pulsion; by 1493 the last Jew had left Palermo. At Naples thousands of
the fugitives were welcomed by Ferrante I, by Dominican friars, and by
the local Jewish community; but in 1540 Charles V decreed the expulsion
of all Jews from Naples.</p>
<p>Genoa had long had a law limiting the entry of additional Jews. When
Conversos arrived from Spain in 1492 they were not allowed to stay more
than a few days. A Genoese historian described them as “cadaverous,
emaciated specters with sunken eyes, differing from the dead only in re-
taining the power to move.” 68 Many died of starvation; women bore dead
infants; some parents sold their children to pay for transport from
Genoa. A small number of the exiles were received into Ferrara, but were
required to wear a yellow badge, 88 perhaps as a precaution against the
spread of dis- ease.</p>
<p>Venice had long been a haven for the Jews. Efforts had been made to
expel them (1395, 1487), but the Senate had protected them as important
contributors to commerce and finance. A considerable part of the
Venetian export trade was carried on by Jews, and they were active in
the import of wool and silk from Spain, spices and pearls from India. 87
For a long time they had, of their own choice, occupied the quarter
named after them — the Giu- decca. In 1516, after consultation with
leading Jews, the Senate ordained that all Jews, except a few specially
licensed, should live in a section of the city known as the Ghetto,
apparently from a foundry (getto) existing there. 88 The Senate ordered
all Marranos or converted Jews to leave Venice; many Christian
competitors urged the measure, some Christian merchants opposed it as
threatening the loss of certain markets, especially in Islam, but
Charles V threw his influence into the scale, and the expulsion decree
was carried out. 89 Soon, however, Jewish merchants crept back into
Venice; exiles from Portugal replaced the expelled Marranos, and
Portuguese be- came for a rime the language of the Venetian Jews.</p>
<p>Many Iberian exiles were kindly received into Rome by Pope Alexander
VI, and prospered under Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, and Paul III.
Clement allowed Marranos to practice Judaism freely, holding that they
were not</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>735</p>
<p>obligated by any compulsory baptism. 60 In Ancona, the Adriatic port
of the Papal States, where the Jews were a vital element in
international trade, Clement established a haven for professing Jews,
and guaranteed them against molestation. As to Paul II I, “no pope,”
said Cardinal Sadoleto, “has ever bestowed upon Christians so many
honors, such privileges and concessions, as Paul has given to the Jews.
They are not only assisted, but positively armed, with benefits and
prerogatives.” 61 A bishop compl ained that Mar- ranos entering Italy
soon returned to the practice of Judaism, circumcising their baptized
children almost “under the eye of the pope and the populace.” Under
pressure of such criticism Paui re-established the Inquisition in Rome
(1542) , but he “took the part of the Marranos throughout his life.”
62</p>
<p>His successors, caught in a reaction against the easy ways of the
Ren- aissance, turned to a policy of making life uncomfortable for the
Jews. Old canonical decrees were again enforced. Paul IV (1555-59)
required every synagogue in the Papal States to contribute ten ducats
(50?) toward the maintenance of a House of Catechumens, where Jews were
to be in- structed in the Christian faith. He forbade the Jews to employ
Christian serv- ants or nurses, to take Christians as medical patients,
to sell Christians anything but old clothes, or to have any avoidable
intercourse with Chris- tians. They were not to use any but the
Christian calendar. All synagogues in Rome were destroyed but one. No
Jew might own realty; those who had any were to sell it within six
months; by this plan Christians were enabled to buy 500,000 crowns’
worth (2,500,000) of Jewish property for a fifth of the actual value. 63
All Jews remaining in Rome were now (1555) con- fined to a ghetto where
10,000 persons had to live within a square kilometer; several families
occupied one room; and the low level of the quarter sub- jected it to
the periodical overflow of the Tiber, making the region a plague-
stricken swamp. 64 The ghetto was surrounded by grim walls, whose gates
were shut at midnight and opened at dawn, except on Sundays and Chris-
tian holydays, when they were closed all day. Outside the ghetto the
Jews were compelled to wear a distinctive garb — the men a yellow hat,
the women a yellow veil or badge. Similar ghettos were established in
Florence and Siena, and, by papal edict, in Ancona and Bologna — where
it was called “In - ferno.” 65 Pau l IV issued a secret order that all
Marranos in Ancona should be cast into Inquisition prisons, and their
goods confiscated. Twenty-four men and one woman were there burned alive
as relapsed heretics ( 1 556) ; 86 and twenty-seven Jews were sent to
the galleys for life. 67 It was, for the Jews of Italy, a ghastly
twilight to a golden age.</p>
<p>A handful of Jewish refugees slipped into France and England despite
the excluding laws. Nearly all Germany was closed to them. Many went to
Antwerp, but only a few were allowed to stay more than a month. Diogo
Mendes, a Portuguese Marrano, established at Antwern -&gt; ranch of the
bank</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>736</p>
<p>(chap, xxxn</p>
<p>that his family had founded in Lisbon. By 1 532 he was so successful
that the Antwerp Council arrested him and fifteen others on a charge of
practicing Judaism. Henry VIII, who employed Mendes as a financial
agent, intervened, and the thirteen were released on payment of a heavy
fine — the “final cause” of many such arrests. Other Jews passed on to
Amsterdam, where they would prosper after the liberation of Holland from
Spain (1589).</p>
<p>Those fugitives who sought asylum in regions of Islam not directly
con- trolled by the Turkish sultan fared little better than in
Christendom. Jews trying to land at Oran, Algiers, and Bugia were shot
at by Moors, and sev- eral were killed. Forbidden to enter the cities,
they built an impromptu ghetto of huts put together from scraps of
lumber; one hut caught fire, and the entire settlement, including many
Jews, was consumed. Those who went to Fez found the gates closed against
them. They squatted in the fields and lived on herbs and roots. Mothers
killed their infants rather than let them die of starvation; parents
sold their children for a little bread; pestilence carried off hundreds
of children and adults. Pirates raided the camp and stole children to
sell them as slaves. 68 Murderers ripped open the bodies of Jews to find
jewels they were believed to have swallowed. 69 After all these
sufferings the survivors, with incredible courage, and under endless
dis- abilities, developed new Jewish communities in Moorish North
Africa. At Algiers, Simon Duran II repeatedly risked his life to protect
the exiles and to organize them into some security. At Fez, Jakob Berab
became the most famous Talmudist of his time.</p>
<p>Under the Mameluk and Ottoman sultans the Spanish refugees found
humane acceptance in Cairo, and soon rose to leadership of the Jewish
com- munity. Selim I abolished the old office of Nagid or prince, by
which one rabbi had appointed all rabbis, and had controlled all Jewish
affairs, in Egypt; thereafter each Jewish community was to choose its
own rabbi and manage its own internal concerns. The new rabbi of Cairo,
David ibn abi- Zimra, a Spanish immigrant, ended the Seleucid method of
chronology which the Jews of Asia and Africa were using, and persuaded
them to adopt (as the Jews of Europe had done in the eleventh century) a
calendar that reckoned by the year since creation {anno mundi),
tentatively fixed as 3761 B.C.</p>
<p>Wherever the Sephardic or Iberian Jews went they acquired cultural —
often political — leadership over the native Jews. In Salonika they
became, and remained till 1918, a numerical majority of the population,
so that non- Spanish Jews who came to live there had to learn Spanish.
Under this Jewish hegemony Salonika was for a time the most flourishing
commercial center in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Sultan Bajazet II welcomed Jewish exiles to Turkey, for they brought
with them precisely those skills in handicrafts, trade, and medicine
which</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII )</p>
<p>737</p>
<p>were least developed among the Turks. Said Bajazet of Ferdinand the
Cath- olic: “You call Ferdinand a wise king, who has made his country
poor and enriched ours?” 70 Like all non -Moslems in Islam, the Jews
were subject to a poll or head tax, but this exempted them from military
service. Most of the Turkish Jews remained poor, but many rose to wealth
and influence. Soon nearly all physicians in Constantinople were Jews.
Suleiman so favored his Jewish physician that he freed him and his
family from all taxation. Jews rose to such prominence as diplomats
under Suleiman that Christian ambas- sadors had to court these Jews as
an approach to the Sultan. Suleiman was shocked by the oppression of the
Ancona Jews under Paul IV, and remon- strated against it to the Pope
(March 9, 1556); he demanded the release of such Ancona Jews as were
subjects of Turkey, and they were freed. 71 Gracia Mendesia, of the
Mendes banking family, after practicing philanthropy, and suffering
insult and injury, in Antwerp, Ferrara, and Venice, finally found peace
in Istanbul.</p>
<p>The Holy Land, under Turkish rule, received again the people that had
first made it holy. As Jerusalem was sacred to Christians and Moslems as
well as to Jews, only a limited number of Hebrews wasallowed to live
there. But at Safed, in Upper Galilee, the Jews grew so rapidly in
number and cultural prestige that Jakob Berab tried to establish a
Sanhedrin there as a ruling congress for all Jewry. It was a bold
conception, but the Jews were too divided in space, language, and ways
to permit such a unification of rule. Nevertheless, in Jewish prayers
throughout Islam and Christendom,</p>
<p>Yahveh was supplicated to “gather the dispersed from the four
corners</p>
<p>of the earth”; and at Yom Kippur and Passover the Jews everywhere
joined in the hope that sustained them thro ugh all tragedies: “Next
year we shall be in Jerusalem.” 72</p>

<li>THE TECHNIQUE OF SURVIVAL</li>
</ol>
<p>The ability of the Jews to recover from misfortune is one of the
impressive wonders of history, part of that heroic resilience which man
in general has shown after the catastrophes of life.</p>
<p>Segregation was not the worst indignity; they were happier and safer
with one another than amid the hostile crowd. Poverty they could bear,
since they had known it for centuries, and it was not their prerogative;
indeed, they were more likely to be proud of their occasional wealth
than conscious of their immemorial indigence. The unkindest cut of all,
however motived, was the badge or distinguishing garment that marked
them off as the despised and rejected of men. The great historian of the
Jews writes bitterly:</p>
<p>738</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>The Jew-badge was an invitation to the gamin to insult the
wearers</p>
<p>and to bespatter them with mud; it was a suggestion to stupid mobs to
fall upon them, to maltreat them, and even to kill them; and it</p>
<p>afforded the higher class an opportunity to ostracize the Jews,
to</p>
<p>plunder them, or to exile them. Worse than this outward dishonor</p>
<p>was the influence of the badge on the Jews themselves. They became
more and more accustomed to their ignominious position, and lost</p>
<p>all feeling of self-respect. They neglected their outward appear-</p>
<p>ance. . . . They became more and more careless of their speech,</p>
<p>because they were not admitted to cultured circles, and in their own
midst they could make themselves understood by means of a jargon.</p>
<p>They lost all taste and sense of beauty, and to some extent
became</p>
<p>despicable, as their enemies desired them to be. 78</p>
<p>This is exaggerated and too general; many Jews retained their pride,
some gloried in the splendor of their dress; we hear again and again of
Jewish girls renowned for their beauty; and the Jiidisch, which in the
sixteenth century evolved as a jargon of German with Slavic and Hebraic
borrowings, was developing a vigorous and varied literature even as
Graetz wrote his History of the Jews. But in any case the supreme crime
of those centuries was the deliberate degradation of an entire people,
the merciless murder of the soul.</p>
<p>Part and basis of the crime was the exclusion of the Jews from almost
all occupations but commerce and finance. For reasons already
summarized, 74 and because a tithe of agricultural produce was demanded
by the Church, Jews more and more withdrew from cultivation of the soil;
and finally they were forbidden to own land. 75 Since they were not
admitted to the guilds (which were formally Christian religious
organizations), they could not rise in the manufacturing world, and
their mercantile operations were hedged in with Christian monopolies. By
and large, in their dealings with Christians, they found themselves
limited to petty industry, trade, and moneylending. In some regions they
were forbidden to sell to Christians anything but second- hand goods.
After the thirteenth century they lost their invidious pre-emi- nence in
finance. But their fluid capital, their international languages, their
international connections through scattered relatives, enabled them to
achieve a high place in the foreign commerce of the Christian states. So
prominent was the Jewish role that those countries which excluded them
lost, and those that received them gained, in the volume of their
international trade. This was one — not the main — reason why Spain and
Portugal declined while Holland rose, and why Antwerp yielded commercial
leadership to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>It was a saving consolation that the Jews, in their internal affairs,
could be ruled by their own laws and customs, their own rabbis and
synagogue coun- cils. As in Islam, so in Jewry, religion, law, and
morality were inextricably one; religion was held to be coextensive with
life. In 1310 Rabbi Jakob ben</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>739</p>
<p>Asher formulated Jewish law, ritual, and morality in Arabaah Turim
(Four Rows); this replaced the Mishrta Torah (1170) of Maimonides with a
code in which all the legislation of the Talmud and the rulings of the
Geonim were made obligatory on all Jews everywhere. The Turim became the
ac- cepted guide for rabbinical law and judgment till 1565.</p>
<p>The disasters of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries disrupted the
social organization of the Jews. The rabbis, like the priests, suffered
a high mor- tality in the Black Death. Persecutions, expulsions, and a
fugitive life almost put an end to Jewish law. The Sephardic Jews found
it difficult to accept the language and customs of the Jewish
communities which offered to absorb them; they set up their own
synagogues, kept their own Spanish or Portu- guese speech; and in many
cities there were separate congregations of Span- ish, Portuguese,
Italian, Greek, or German Jews, each with its own rabbi, customs,
charities, and jealousies. 76 In this crisis the Jewish family saved the
Jewish people; the mutual devotion of parents and children, brothers and
sisters, provided a haven of stability and security. These centuries of
disorder in Jewish mores ended when Rabbi Joseph Karo issued from Safed
his Shul- chtm Aruch (Venice, 1 564-65) ; in this T able in Order the
religion, law, and customs of the Jews were once more codified. But as
Karo based his code chiefly on Spanish Judaism, the Hebrews of Germany
and Poland felt that he had paid too little attention to their own
traditions and interpretations of the Law; Rabbi Moses Isserles of
Cracow added to the Table in Order his Mapath ha-Shulchan (A Cloth for
the Table, 1571), which formulated the Askenazi variations on Karo’s
mostly Sephardic code. With this emendation the Shulchan Aruch remained
till our own time the Justinian and Blackstone of orthodox Jews. To say
of a Jew that he obeyed all the precepts of the Shulchan Aruch was the
summit of Jewish praise.</p>
<p>Since all formulations of Jewish law were based on the Talmud, we can
— or can we? — imagine the trepidation with which the Jews followed the
vicissitudes of their second holy book. In its literary and less
authoritative section — the Haggada — there were some passages that
ridiculed certain Chris- tian beliefs. Converts from Judaism paved their
way into Christian accept- ance by denouncing these passages, and
calling for the suppression of the entire Talmud. Despite such
movements, culminating in the attack of Pfef- ferkorn on Reuchlin, Leo X
encouraged the first printing of the Talmud (Venice, 1520); but Julius
III signalized the passing of the Renaissance by ordering the
Inquisition to burn all copies to be found in Italy ( 1553) . Jewish
homes were invaded; thousands of copies were seized; there were bonfires
of Jewish books in Rome, Bologna, Ravenna, Ferrara, Padua, Venice, and
Mantua; Milan, however, refused to obey the incendiary decree. 77 Com-
mittees of Jews pleaded with the Pope to rescind his edict; he
procrastinated while the volumes burned; but Pius IV ruled that the
Talmud might be</p>
<p>740 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>published after submitting to censorship. Thereafter the Jews
censured their own publications. 78</p>
<p>The Z ohar, text of Jewish Cabalism, survived uninjured because some
Catholic scholars thought they found in it proofs of the divinity of
Christ. The Zohar had been written shortly before 1 295 as one of a
series of mystical works transmitting the Cabal a or “secret tradition”
of Jews who took refuge from poverty, persecution, and befuddlement in
contemplating the divine and esoteric symbolism of numbers, letters,
backward reading of words, the Ineffable Name of Yahveh, and so on.
Sorrowing Jews gathered in private groups to seek, by fasting, weeping,
ascetic austerities, and Cabalistic inter- pretations, some novel
revelation, above all as to the coming of the Messiah who would redeem
Israel from all its griefs.</p>
<p>Those who have tried to feel the unprecedented depth of racial
suffering which the Jews experienced in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and
sixteenth cen- turies, can understand such forgivable escapes into
consolatory mysticism, and the repeated deception of the desperate Jews
by belief that the Messiah had actually come. In 1524 a young and
handsome Arabian Jew, calling himself David Reubeni, rode on a white
horse through Rome to the Vatican, and presented himself to Clement VII
as brother and envoy of a Jewish king whom he described as reigning in
Arabia over the old Hebrew tribe of Reu- ben. His king, said David, had
300,000 soldiers, with insufficient arms; if the Pope and the European
princes would provide the weapons, the tribe would drive the Moslems out
of Palestine. Clement was interested, and treated David with all the
courtesies due to an ambassador. The Jews of Rome were pleased to see a
Jew so honored; they supplied David with the means to keep high
diplomatic state; and when an invitation came to him from John III of
Portugal, he sailed in a ship with a numerous retinue and under a Jewish
flag.</p>
<p>John III was so taken with his proposals that he suspended the
persecution of the Marranos. The Jews of Portugal, most of them baptized
against their will, became half-hysterical with joy, and many proclaimed
their belief that David was the Messiah. Diogo Pires, a converted Jew
who had become secre- tary to the King, had himself circumcised to prove
his Judaism; he changed his name to Solomon Molcho, made his way to
Turkey, and announced that Reubeni was the forerunner of the Messiah,
who himself would arrive in</p>
<ol start="1540" type="1">
<li>Reubeni had made no claims to be either Messiah or forerunner; he
was a visionary impostor who wanted money, ships, and arms. The flight
of Pires-Molcho a roused King John’s suspicions; he bade Reubeni depart;
David left, was stranded on the coast of Spain, and was arrested by the
Inquisition. Charles V, apparently to please Clement, ordered him
released. Reubeni went to Venice (1530), and proposed to the Senate that
it should arm the Jews of Europe for an attack upon the Turks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile Molcho came to Ancona, received a passport from the
Pope.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE JEWS 741</p>
<p>rode across Italy, and preached Judaism fervently in Rome. When the
Inquisition sought to arrest him as a relapsed Converso, Clement rescued
him and sent him safely out of the city. Although Molcho had now lost
faith in Reubeni, he joined him in a rash mission to Ratisbon, where
they peti- tioned Charles to arm the Marranos against Islam. Charles had
them arrested, and brought them with him to Mantua. There Molcho was
sentenced to be burned. At the last moment he was offered an Imperial
pardon if he would return to Christianity; he refused, and welcomed
martyrdom (1532). Reubeni was sent to Spain, was imprisoned by the
Inquisition, and died about 1536, apparently by poisoning. The
brokenhearted Jews of Europe crept back into their ghettoes, their
mysticism, and their despair.</p>
<p>V. JEWISH THOUGHT</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that the age of the Second Dispersion
should produce any high culture among the Jews; their energy was
consumed in the brute task of survival. Education, in which they had
excelled, was dis- rupted by the mobility and insecurity of life; and
while Christian Europe moved with exhilaration into the Renaissance, the
Jews of Christendom moved into the ghetto and the Cabala. The Second
Commandment forbade them to share in the revival of art. Jewish scholars
were many, but for the most part they sank themselves in the Talmud.
There were grammarians like Profiat Duran and Abraham de Balmes,
translators like Isaac ibn-Pulkar, who put al-Ghazzali into Hebrew, and
Jakob Man tin, who rendered Avi- cenna, Averroes, Maimonides, and Levi
ben Gerson into Latin. Elijah Levita alarmed orthodox Jews by arguing
conclusively (1538) that the Masoretic text of the Old Testament — i.e.,
the text with notes, vowel points and punc- tuation — was not older than
the fifth century a.d.</p>
<p>The Odyssey of the Abrabanels illustrates the vicissitudes of the
Jewish intellect in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Born in
Lisbon in 1437, Don Isaac Abrabanel served Affonso V of Portugal as
finance minister; but he mingled his public life with Biblical and
historical studies, and made his spacious home a salon of scholars,
scientists, and men of affairs. When Affonso died Abrabanel lost the
royal favor, and fled to Spain (1484). He was absorbed in writing
commentaries on the historical books of the Bible when Ferdinand the
Catholic called him to office, and for eight years Isaac shared in
managing the finances of Castile. He labored to avert the disaster that
befell the Jews in 1492; failing, he joined them in their melancholy
exodus. At Naples he was employed by the government, but the French
invaders (1495) sacked his home, destroyed his choice library, and
forced him to flee to Corfu. There he wrote as many a Jew must have
written in</p>
<p>742 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>those years: “My wife, my sons, and my books are far from me, and I
am left alone, a stranger in a strange land.” 79 He made his way to
Venice, and was given a diplomatic post (1503). Amid these fluctuations
of fortune he found time to write several philosophical or theological
works, now of minor interest; but he established the principle that
Scriptural events and ideas should be interpreted in terms of the social
and political life of their times. He was allowed to spend his final six
years in unwonted security and peace.</p>
<p>His sons were his decoration. Samuel Abrabanel prospered at Salonika,
was made finance minister at Naples, and earned the love of his people
by his many philanthropies. Judah Leon Abrabanel — Leo Hebraeus — rose
to such prominence as a physician in Genoa and Naples that he became
known as Leon Medigo. He studied many sciences, wrote poetry, and
ventured into metaphysics. In 1505 he was appointed physician to Gonzalo
de Cordoba, but two years later the “Great Captain” fell out with
Ferdinand, and Leon joined his father in Venice. His Dialoghi d’ Amove
(written in 1502, pub - lished in 1535) found quite an audience among
the Renaissance Italians, for whom the philosophical analysis of love
served as prelude or obbligato to amorous victories. Intellectual beauty
— the beauty of order, plan, and har- mony — is superior to physical
beauty, argued the Dialogues; the supreme beauty is the order, plan, and
harmony of the universe, which is the outward expression of divine
beauty; love rises in stages from the admiration and pursuit of physical
to intellectual to heavenly beauty, and culminates in the intellectual
love of God — the understanding and appreciation of the cosmic order,
and the desire to be united with the Deity. The manuscript may have been
known to Castiglione, who made Bembo speak to like effect in 11 corti-
giano (1528) ; and the printed book may have found its way across a
century to influence Spinoza’s amor dei intellectmlis . 80</p>
<p>To this ethereal amour the dispersed Portuguese Jews preferred
Usque’s impassioned prose poem in Portuguese, Consolation for the
Sorrows of Israel (Ferrara, 1553 ). It pictured the alternate triumphs
and disasters of the Jewish nation, and comforted the Jews with the
assurance that they were still God’s chosen people. They had been
punished by God for their sins, but they were being purified by their
sufferings; and no deviltry of man could cheat them of their divine
destiny to happiness and glory.</p>
<p>Jewish contributions to science inevitably slackened in this
prolonged vivisection of a people. Not only did insecurity, poverty, and
instability im- pede scientific pursuits, but one of the most respected
and influential of the rabbis, Solomon ben Abraham ben Adret of
Barcelona, at the very begin- ning of this period (1305), had forbidden,
under penalty of excommunica- tion, the teaching of science or
philosoohy to any Jew under the age of</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>743</p>
<p>twenty-five, on the ground that such instruction might damage
religious faith. Nevertheless Isaac Israeli the Younger, of Toledo,
summarized the astronomy of his time (1320), and clarified the Jewish
calendar and chro- nology; Immanuel Bonfils of Tarascon drew up valuable
astronomical tables, and anticipated exponential and decimal calculus;
Abraham Crescas of Ma- jorca, “Master of Maps and Compasses to the
Government of Aragon,” made a mapamundi (1377) which was so widely
recognized as the best world map yet made that Aragon sent it as a
distinguished gift to Charles VI of France, where it is now a prized
possession of the Bibliotheque Nationale. Abraham’s son Jehuda C rescas
was the first director of Henry the Naviga- tor’s nautical observatory
at Sagres, and helped to chart his explorations. Pedro Nunes’s Treatise
on the Sphere (1537) opened the way for Mercator</p>
<p>Abraham Zacuto was the one major figure in the Jewish science of the
fifteenth century. While teaching at Salamanca (1473-78) he compiled his
Almanack perpetuum, whose astronomical tables were used as navigational
guides on the voyages of Vasco da Gama, Cabral, Albuquerque, and
(after</p>
<ol start="1496" type="1">
<li>Columbus. Zacuto was among the refugees from Spain (1492). He found
temporary asylum in Portugal; he was consulted by the court in pre-
paring Da Gama’s expedition to India, and the ships were equipped with
his improved astrolabe. But in 1497 persecution drove him from Portugal
too. For years he wandered in poverty until he settled in Tunis; and
there, in his old age, he comforted himself by writing a history of his
people. His pupil Joseph Vecinho, physician to John II of Portugal, was
sent to chart latitudes and solar declinations along the Guinea coast,
and the charts so prepared proved invaluable to Da Gama. Vecinho was one
of the commission to which John II referred Columbus’s proposals for
seeking a western route to the Indies (1484), and shared in the negative
decision. 81</li>
</ol>
<p>Jewish physicians were still the most sought for in Europe. Harassed
with religious condemnations and official restrictions, and risking
their lives in treating prominent Christians, they were nevertheless the
favorites of popes and kings. Their contributions to medical science
were not now brilliant, except for d’Orta’s to tropical medicine; but
Amatus Lusitanus exemplified the finest traditions of his profession and
his people. Driven by the Inquisi- tion from the Portugal whose Latin
name he had taken, he lived passingly in Antwerp, Ferrara, and Rome, and
settled in Ancona ( c . 1549), whence he was often called to treat that
same Pope Julius III who labored to destroy the Talmud. To the end of
his life he was able to take oath that he had never concerned himself
with compensation, had never accepted valuable presents, had served the
poor without fee, had made no distinction in his practice</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>744</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>among Christian, Jew, and Turk, and had allowed no difficulties of
time or distance to interfere with devotion to his calling. His
Curiationum medi- cinalium centuriae septem (1563) gave clinical records
of 700 cases that he had treated; these Centuries were studied and
treasured by physicians throughout Europe. The king of Poland invited
Amatus to be his personal physician; Lusitanus preferred to remain in
Ancona; but in 1 556 he was com- pelled to resume his wandering when
Paul IV demanded the conversion or imprisonment of all Marranos in
Italy.</p>
<p>Ben Adret ’s moratorium on science and philosophy had less effect on
philosophy than on science, and less in France than in Spain. The
influence of Maimonides was still strong among the Jews who managed to
survive in southern France. Joseph Kaspi dared to write treatises on
logic and ethics for the guidance of his son, and defended the liberal
philosophical tradition that had received its classical exposition in
Maimonides’s Moreh Nebuchim. This approach produced a major Jewish
thinker in Levi ben Gerson, known to the Christian world as Gersonides.
Like most Jewish philosophers, he earned his bread by practicing
medicine, and realized Hippocrates’s ideal of the physician-philosopher.
Bom at Bagnols (1288) in a family of scholars, he lived nearly all his
life in Orange, Perpignan, and Avignon, where he worked in peace under
the protection of the popes. There was hardly a science that he did not
deal with, hardly a problem in philosophy that he left untouched. He was
a learned Talmudist, he contributed to the mathematics of music, he
wrote poetry.</p>
<p>In mathematics and astronomy he was among the lights of the age. He
anticipated (1321) the method later formulated by Maurolico (1575) and
Pascal (1654), of finding the number of simple permutations of n objects
by mathematical induction. His treatise on trigonometry paved the way
for Regiomontanus, and was so widely esteemed that Pope Clement VI com-
missioned its translation into Latin as De sinibus, chordis, et arcubus
(1342). He invented, or materially improved, the cross-staff for
measuring the alti- tude of stars; this remained for two centuries a
precious boon to navigation. He made his own astronomic observations,
and ably critized the Ptolemaic system. He discussed but rejected the
heliocentric hypothesis, in a manner suggesting that there were quite a
few adherents of it in his time. He per- fected the camera obscura, and
used it, with the cross-staff, to determine more accurately the
variations in the apparent diameter of the sun and moon.</p>
<p>As ben Gerson’s science stemmed from the Arabic mathematicians and
astronomers, so his philosophy was based on a critical study of the com-
mentaries in which Averroes had expounded Aristotle. During the years 1
3 19-2 1 Levi composed commentaries on these commentaries, covering
Aristotle’s treatises on logic, physics, astronomy, meteorology, botany,
zool -</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>745</p>
<p>ogy, psychology, and metaphysics; and to these studies he added, of
course, repeated readings of Maimonides. His own philosophy, and most of
his science, were embodied in a Hebrew work entitled, in the fashion of
the age, Milchamoth Adonai ( Battles of the Lord, 1317-29). It ranks
second only to the Moreh Nebuchim in Jewish medieval philosophy, and
continues Maimonides’s attempt to reconcile Greek thought with Jewish
faith, much to the detriment of the faith. When we consider the similar
efforts of Aver- roes and Thomas Aquinas to harmonize Mohammedanism and
Christianity with Aristotle, we might almost say that the impact of
Aristotle on medieval theologies inaugurated their disintegration and
the transition from the Age of Faith to the Age of Reason. Gersonides
sought to soften orthodox resent- ment by professing his readiness to
abandon his views if these should be proved contrary to Scripture — an
old Scholastic dodge. Nevertheless he went on to reason at great length
about God, creation, the eternity of the world, the immortality of the
soul; and when his conclusions contradicted Scripture he interpreted it
with such violence to the text that his critics renamed his book Battles
against the Lord . 62 We must not take literally, said Levi, such
stories as that of Joshua stopping the sun; these and similar “miracles”
were probably natural events whose causes were forgotten or unknown. 88
Finally he proclaimed his rationalism without disguise: “The Torah
cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason
urges us to believe.” 84</p>
<p>Gersonides derived the existence of God from what the atheist Holbach
would call “the system of nature”: the law and order of the univer se
reveal a cosmic Mind. To this he adds the teleological argument: most
things in living nature seem designed as means to end, and Providence
gives every organism the means of self-protection, development, and
reproduction. The world as cosmos or order was created in time, but not
out of nothing; an inert, formless mass pre-existed from eternity;
creation gave it life and form. Between God and the created forms is an
intermediary power which Ger- son, following Aristotle and Averroes,
calls nous poietikos, the Active or Creative Intellect; this emanation
of divine intelligence guides all things, and becomes the soul in man.
So far as the soul depends upon the individual’s sensations, it is
mortal; so far as it conceives universals, and perceives the order and
unity of the world, it becomes consciously part of the Active Intellect,
which is immortal.</p>
<p>Ben Gerson’s philosophy was rejected by the Jews as essentially a
form f Averroism, a rationalism that would ultimately dissolve religious
belief. Christian thinkers studied him, Spinoza was influenced by him;
but the heart and mind of thoughtful Jews were more faithfully expressed
by Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas, who had imbibed the conservatism of
Solomon ben Adret. Bom in Barcelona in 1340, Crescas lived through a
period of rabid anti-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>746</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>semitism. He was arrested on a charge of having desecrated a Host; he
was soon released, but his son, on the very eve of marriage, was killed
in the massacres of 1391. Persecution strengthened Hasdai’s faith, for
only by belief in a just God and a compensatory heaven could he bear a
life so evil in injustice and suffering. Seven years after the martyrdom
of his son he published in Spanish a T ratado which sought to explain to
Christians why a Jew should not be asked to accept Christianity.
Courteously and moder- ately he argued that the Christian dogmas of the
Fall, Trinity, Immaculate Conception, Incarnation, Atonement, and
Transubstantiation involved in- superable contradictions and absurd
impossibilities. Yet when he composed his major work, Or Adonai ( Light
of the Lord, 1410), he took a stand from which the Christians might have
defended these theories: he renounced rea- son and bade it surrender to
faith. Though he was not officially a rabbi, he shared the rabbinical
view that the renewed persecutions were a divine punishment for
subjecting the revealed religion to rationalistic dilution. If he wrote
philosophy it was through no admiration for it, but to prove the
weakness of philosophy and reason, and to affirm the necessity of
belief. He repudiated the attempts of Maimonides and Gerson to reconcile
Judaism with Aristotle; who was this Greek that God had to agree with
him? He protested the Aristotelian notion that God’s supreme quality is
knowledge; rather it is love; God is the Absolutely Good. Crescas
admitted that reason cannot harmoniz e God’s foreknowledge with man’s
freedom; we must there - fore reject not freedom but reason. We must
believe in God, free will, and immortality for our peace of mind and our
moral health, and we need make no pretense to prove these beliefs by
reason. We must choose between our proud, weak reason, which dissolves
belief and begets despair, and our hum- ble faith in God’s Word, through
which alone we can bear the indignities and inequities of fife.</p>
<p>Crescas was the last of a brilliant fine of medieval Jewish
philosophers. He was not at once appreciated by his people, for his
pupil Joseph Albo caught the philosophical audience with his more
readable Ikkarim (Fundamental Principles) ; this combined Maimonides and
Crescas in an eclectic system more consonant than either with orthodox
Judaism, which was not prepared to admit the irrationality of faith.
After Albo’s death (1444) the Jews re - tired from philosophy, almost
from history, till Spinoza. Massacres, disloca- tions, destitution, and
restrictions of residence and occupation had broken their spirit, and
had diminished their number to the lowest level since the fall of
Jerusalem in 70 a.d . 85 The despised and rejected of men found refuge
in the sorrowing chants and comforting fellowship of the synagogue, in
hopes of divine forgiveness, earthly justification, and celestial bliss.
Scholars buried themselves in the Talmud, confining their reasoning to
the elucidation of the saving Law, while some followed the Cabala into a
mysticism that</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>

<p>747</p>
<p>sublimated misery into heaven-scaling delusions. Jewish poetry ceased
to sing. Only a remnant lifted its head now and then defiantly against
the storm, or softened the ironies of life with wistful humor and wry
wit. Not till the humble Jew of Amsterdam would dare to unite Judaism,
Scholasti- cism, and Cartesianism into a sublime merger of religion and
science would the Jews wake from their long and healing sleep to take
their place again in the raceless and timeless international of the
mind.</p>
