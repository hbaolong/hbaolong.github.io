<p>Art in the Age of Holbein</p>
<p>15*7-64</p>
<p>I. ART, THE REFORMATION, AND THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>A RT had to suffer from the Reformation, if only because
Protestantism xJL believed in the Ten Commandments. Had not the Lord God
said, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any li keness
of any- thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth”? (Exodus 20:4) How was
representative art possible after that sweeping prohibition? The Jews
had obeyed, and had passed by art. The Moslems had almost obeyed, had
kept their art decorative, largely abstract, often representing things,
rarely persons, never God. Protestantism, rediscovering the Old
Testament, followed the Semitic line. Catholicism, whose Greco-Roman
heritage had overshadowed its Judaic origin, had more and more ignored
the veto: Gothic sculpture had fashioned saints and gods in stone;
Italian painting had pictured the Bible story, and the Renaissance had
quite forgotten the Second Commandment in a blooming riot of repre-
sentative art. Perhaps that old interdict had been meant to ban
representation for magical ends; and the patrons of art, in Renaissance
Italy, had the good sense to override a primitive and now meaningless
taboo.</p>
<p>The Church, greatest patron of all, had employed the arts to form the
let- terless in the dogmas and legends of the faith. To the
ecclesiastical statesman who felt that myths were vital to morality,
this use of art seemed reasonable. But when the myths, like purgatory,
were manipulated to finance the ex- travagances and abuses of the
Church, reformers forgivably rebelled against the painting and sculpture
that inculcated the myths. In this matter Luther was moderate, even if
he had to revise the Commandments. “I do not hol d that the Gospel
should destroy all the arts, as certain superstitious folk be- lieve. On
the contrary, I would fain see all arts . . . serving Him Who hath
created them and given them to us. The law of Moses forbade only the
image of God.” 1 In 1526 he called upon his adherents to “assail the . .
. idola - ters of the Roman Antichrist by means of painting.” 2 Even
Calvin, whose followers were the most enthusiastic iconoclasts, gave a
limited approval to images. “I am nor so scrupulous as to judge th at no
images should be endured . . . but seeing that the art of painting and
carving . . . cometh from God, I</p>
<p>820</p>
<p>821</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) art IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN</p>
<p>require that the practice of art should be kept pure and lawful.
Therefore men should not paint nor carve anything but such as can be
seen with the eye.” 3 Reformers less human than Luther, less cautious
than Calvin, pre - ferred to outlaw religious painting and sculpture
altogether, and to clear their churches of all ornament; “truth”
banished beauty as an infidel. In England, Scotland, Switzerland, and
northern Germany the destruction was wholesale and indiscriminate; in
France the Huguenots melted down the reliquaries, shrines, and other
vessels found in the churches that came into their power. We should have
to recapture the ardor of men risking their lives to reform religion
before we could understand the angry passion that in moments of victory
destroyed the images that had contributed to their subjection. The
demolition was brutal and barbarous, but the guilt of it must be shared
by the institution that had for centuries obstructed its own reform.</p>
<p>Gothic art ended in this period, but the Reformation was only one
cause of its demise. The reaction against the medieval Church brought
with it a distaste for the styles of architecture and ornament long
associated with her. And yet Gothic was dying even before Luther spoke.
It ailed in Catholic France as well as in rebellious Germany and
England; it was consumed in its own flamboyance. And the Renaissance, as
well as the Reformation, was fatal to Gothic. For the Renaissance came
from Italy, which had never loved Gothic and had travestied it even in
adopting it; and the Renaissance spread chiefly among educated people
whose polite skepticism could not under- stand the enthusiastic faith of
crusading and Gothic days. As the Reforma- tion progressed, the Church
herself, which had found in Gothic architecture her supreme artistic
expression, was too impoverished by the loss of Britain, Germany, and
Scandinavia, and the inroads made upon her revenues by Catholic kings,
to finance art as lavishly as before, or to determine taste and style.
Day by day a secularizing, paganizing Renaissance asserted its classical
predilections over the sacred traditions of medieval faith and form. Men
impiously reached over pious and fearful centuries to grasp again the
earth- loving, pleasure-loving passions of antiquity. War was declared
against Gothic as the art of the barbarians who had destroyed Imperial
Rome. The conquered Romans came back to life, rebuilt their temples,
exhumed the statues of their gods, and bade first Italy, then France and
England to re- sume the art that had embodied the glory of Greece and
the grandeur of Rome. The Renaissance conquered Gothic, and in France it
conquered the Reformation.</p>
<p>822</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ART OF THE FRENCH RENAISSANCE</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>“A Malady of Building”</li>
</ol>
<p>In French ecclesiastical architecture Gothic fought successfully for
a reprieve. Some old cathedrals added fresh elements, necessarily
Gothic; so Caen’s St. -Pierre completed its famous choir; Beauvais built
its south transept; and Gothic made almost its expiring effort when Jean
Vast raised above that transept crossing a spire 500 feet high (1553).
When, on Ascension Day, 1573, that towering audacity collapsed into the
ruined choir, the disaster symbolized the end of the noblest style in
architectural history.</p>
<p>Lesser Gothic splendors rose in this period at Pontoise, Coutances,
and a dozen other cities of France. In Paris, where every glance reveals
some marvel from a believing past, two handsome Gothic churches took
form: St.-Etienne-du-Mont (1492-1626) and St.-Eustache (1532-1654). But
Renaissance features stole into them: in St.-Etienne the magnificent
stone screen overarching the choir; in St.-Eustache the compound
pilasters and quasi-Corinthian capitals.</p>
<p>The replacement of ecclesiastical Gothic with secular Renaissance
archi- tecture reflected the taste of Francis I, and the humanistic
emphasis on ter- restrial pleasure rather than celestial hope. All the
economic fruition, the aristocratic patronage, the pagan hedonism, that
had fed the fires of art in Renaissance Italy now nourished the devotion
of architects, painters, sculp- tors, potters, and goldsmiths in France.
Italian artists were brought in to mingle their skills and decorative
motives with surviving Gothic forms. Not only in Paris, but at
Fontainebleau, Moulins, Tours, Bourges, Angers, Lyons, Dijon, Avignon,
and Aix-en-Provence the brilliance of Italian design, the realism of
Flemish painting, and the taste and bisexual grace of the French
aristocracy combined to produce in France an art that challenged and
inherited the Italian supremacy.</p>
<p>At the head of the movement was a king who loved art with abandon and
yet with discrimination. The lighthearted, smiling spirit of Francis I
wrote itself into the architecture of the reign. Osez! he told his
artists — “Dare!” 4 — and he let them experiment as even Italy had not
allowed. He recognized the Flemish power in portraiture, kept Jean
Clouet as his court painter, com- missioned portraits of himself and his
entourage by Joos van Cleve. But in all the arts of refinement and
decoration it was Italy that inspired him. After his victory at
Marignano (1515) he visited Milan, Pavia, Bologna, and other Italian
cities, and enviously studied their architecture, painting, and minor
arts. Cellini quotes him as saying: “I well remember to have inspected
all the best works, and by the greatest masters, of all Italy”; 5
probably the exag -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 823</p>
<p>geration is the ebullient Cellini’s. Vasa ri notes in a dozen
instances the pur- chase of Italian art by Francis I through agents in
Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan. Through these efforts Leonardo’s Mona
Lisa, Michelangelo’s Leda, Bronzino’s Venus and Cupid, Titian’s
Magdalen, and a thousand vases, medals, drawings, statuettes, paintings,
and tapestries crossed the Alps to end their travels in the Louvre.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic monarch, if he could have had his way, would have
im- po rted all the best artists of Italy. Money was to be lavished
temptingly. “I will choke you with gold,” he promised Cellini. Benvenuto
came, and stayed intermittently (1541-45), long enough to confirm French
goldsmithry in a tradition of exquisite design and technique. Domenico
Bemabei “Bocca - doro” had come to France under Charles VIII; Francis
employed him to design a new Hotel de Ville f or Paris (1532); nearly a
century passed before it was finished; the Commune of 1871 burned it
down; it was rebuilt to Boccadoro’s plan. Leonardo came in his old age
(1516); all the world of French art and pedigree worshiped him, but we
know of no work done by him in France. Andrea del Sarto came (1518), and
soon fled. Giovanni Bat- tista “II Rosso” was lured fro m Florence
(1530), and stayed in France till his suicide. Giulio Romano received
urgent invitations, but was charmed by Mantua; however, he sent his most
brilliant assistant, Francesco Primaticcio (1532). Francesco Pellegrino
came, and Giacomo da Vignola, and Niccolo dell’Abbate, and Sebastiano
Serlio, and perhaps a dozen more. At the same time French artists were
encouraged to go to Italy and study the palaces of Florence, Ferrara,
and Milan, and the new St. Peter’s rising in Rome. Not since the
conquest of ancient Rome by Greek art and thought had there been so rich
a transfusion of cultural blood.</p>
<p>Native and Flemish artists resented the Italian seduction; and for
half a century (1498-1545) the history of French architecture was a
royal battle between a Gothic style affectionately rooted in the soil,
and Italian ipodes seeping into France in the wake of conquered
conquerors. The struggle pic- tured itself in stone in the chateaux of
the Loire. There Gothic still had the upper hand, and Gallic
master-masons dominated the design: a feudal castle within a protective
moat, with fortresslike towers rising at the corners in ma- jestic
verticality; spacious mullioned windows to invite the sun, and sloping
roofs to shed the snow, and dormer windows peering out like monocles
from the roofs. But the Italian invaders were allowed to depress the
pointed arch back into the older rounded form; to arrange the facades in
tiers of rectangu- lar windows buttressed with pilasters and crowned
with pediments; and to decorate the interiors with classic columns,
capitals, friezes, moldings, roun- dels, arabesques, and sculptured
cornucopias of plants, flowers, fruits animals, imperial busts, and
mythical divinities. Theoretically the two styles, Gothic and classical,
were incongruous; their fusion by French discrimi-</p>
<p>824 the reformation (chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>nation and taste into a harmonious beauty shared in making France the
Hellas of the modem world.</p>
<p>A fever of building — une maladie de batir, a wondering general
called it 6 — now seized upon France, or Francis. To the old chateau at
Blois he added ( 1 5 1 5 — 19) for Queen Claude a north wing whose
architect was a French- man, Jacques Sourdeau, but whose style was quite
Renaissance. Finding it inconvenient to build a stairway within the
addition, Sourdeau designed one of the architectural cynosures of the
age — an external spiral staircase rising in an octagonal tower through
three stages to an elegant gallery projecting from the roof, each stage
richly adorned with a sculptured balcony.</p>
<p>After the death of his burdened Queen, Francis turned his
architectural passion to Chambord — three miles south of the Loire, ten
northeast of Blois. There the dukes of Orleans had built a hunting
lodge; Francis replaced this (1526-44) with a predominantly Gothic
chateau, so vast — with its 440 rooms, and stables for 1,200 horses —
that it required the labor of 1,800 work- men through twelve years. Its
French designers made the north facade fas- cinating but confused with a
maze of towers, “lanterns,” pinnacles, and sculptural ornament; and they
distinguished the interior with a spiral staircase of great splendor,
unique for a double passage that divided ascent from descent. Francis
favored Chambord as a happy hunting ground; here his court loved to
gather with all its trappings; and here he spent the declining years of
his life. Most of the interior ornament was destroyed by revolution-
ists in. 1793, in belated revenge on royal extravagance. Another
Francis-can palace — the chateau of Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne, was
adorned with a majolica facade by Girolamo della Robbia, and was
completely demolished in the Revolution.</p>
<p>The extravagance was not confined to the King. Many of his aides
treated themselves to palaces that still seem like importations from
some fairy realm. One of the most perfect is Azay-le-Rideau, on an
island in the Indre; Gilles Berthelot, who built it (1521), was not for
nothing treasurer of France. Thomas Bohier, receiver-general of taxes in
Normandy, built Chenonceaux (1513 f.) ; Jean Cottereau, finance
minister, rebuilt the chateau of Main- tenon; Guillaume de Montmorency
raised a lordly palace at Chantilly ( 1530) — another casualty of the
Revolution. His son Anne de Montmorency, Con- stable of France, erected
the chateau of Ecouen (1531-40) near Saint- Denis. The chateau of
Villandry was restored by Jean le Breton, secretary of state; Usse was
completed by Charles d’Espinay. Add to these the hdtels or palaces of
Valengay, of Semblangay at Tours, of Escoville at Caen, of Bemuys at
Toulouse, of Lallemont at Bourges, of Bourg-theroulde at Rouen, and a
hundred others, all products of this reckless reign, and we may judge
the prosperity of the lords and the poverty of the people.</p>
<p>Feeling inadequately housed, Francis decided to rebuild the chateau
that</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 825</p>
<p>Louis VII and Louis IX had erected at Fontainebleau, for this, said
Cellini, was the spot In his kingdom that the King loved best.” The
donjon and the chapel were restored, the rest was torn down; and on the
site Gilles de Breton and Pierre Chambiges raised in Renaissance style a
congeries of palaces connected by a graceful Gaterie de Frangois
Premier. The exterior was not attractive; perhaps the King, like the
merchant princes of Florence, thought a pretentious fagade, so near the
city, might draw an evil eye from the populace. He kept his esthetic
flair for the interior; and there he relied upon Italians raised in the
decorative tradition of Raphael and Giulio Ro- mano.</p>
<p>For ten years (153 1-4 1 ) II Rosso — so named from his ruddy face —
worked on the adornment of the Gallery of Francis I. Vasari describes
the artist, then thirty- seven, as a man “of fine presence, grave and
gracious speech, an accomplished musician, a well- versed philosopher,”
and “an excellent archi - tect” as well as a sculptor and painter; 7
such were the undivided men of that expansive age. Rosso arranged the
walls into fifteen panels, each adorned in High Renaissance style: a
base of carved and inlaid walnut wainscoting; a fresco of scenes from
classical mythology or history; a rich surrounding of stucco decorations
in statuary, shells, weapons, medallions, animal or human figures,
garlands of fruit or flowers; and a ceiling of deeply coffered wood
completed the effect of warm color, sensuous beauty, and careless
delight. All this was quite to the King’s taste. He gave Rosso a house
in Paris, and a pension of 1,400 livres (5,000?) a year. The artist,
says Vasari, “lived like a lord, with his servants and horses, giving
banquets to his frien ds.” 8 He gathered to his service half a dozen
Italian, and several French, painters and sculptors, who formed the
origin and nucleus of the “School of Fontaine - bleau.” At the height of
his success and splendor his Italian temper ended his career. He accused
one of his aides, Francesco Pellegrino, of robbing him; Pellegrino,
after suffering much torture, was found to be innocent; Rosso, in shame
and remorse, swallowed poison and died in agony at the age of forty- six
(1541).</p>
<p>Francis mourned him, but he had already found in Primaticcio an
artist capable of continuing Rosso’s work in the same style of
voluptuous imagina - tion. Primaticcio was a handsome youth of
twenty-seven when he reached France in 1532. The King soon recognized
his versatile ability as architect, sculptor, and painter; he gave him a
staff of assistants, a good salary, and, later, the revenues of an
abbey; so the contributions of the faithful were transformed into art
that would possibly have shocked the monks. Prima- ticcio made designs
for the royal tapestry works; carved a masterly chimney piece for Queen
Eleonora’s room at Fontainebleau, and repaid the Duchesse d’Etampes’
patronage and protection by adorning her room in the chateau with
paintings and stucco statuary. The paintings have died repeated
deaths</p>
<p>8z6</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>under restorations, but the statues remain in their glory; one stucco
lady, raising her hands to a cornice, is among the fairest figures in
French art. How could a king enamored of such demure shamelessness
accept stern Calvinism in place of a Church that smiled tolerantly upon
these charming nudes?</p>
<p>The demise of the royal satyr, and the accession of the stern Henry
II, did not inju re Primaticcio’s status or bowdlerize his style. Now
(1551 -56), aided by Philibert Delorme and Niccolo dell’Abbate, he
designed, painted, carved, and otherwise decorated the Gallery of Henry
II at Fontainebleau. Here too the paintings have been ruined, but the
grace of the female statues is alluring, and the end wall is a stately
splendor of classic elements. Still finer, we are told (for it was
destroyed in 1738), was the Gallery of Ulysses, which Primaticcio and
his company adorned with 16 1 subjects from the Odyssey.</p>
<p>The chateau of Fontainebleau marked the triumph of the classic style
in France. Francis filled its halls with sculptures and objects of art
bought for him in Italy and reinforcing the classic message by their
excellence. Mean- while Sebastiano Serlio, who worked for a while at
Fontainebleau, published his Opere di architettura (1548), which
preached the Vitruvian classicism of his master Baldassare Petruzzi; it
was at once translated into French by Jean Martin, who also translated
Vitruvius ( 1 547). From the School of Fontaine- bleau French artists
trained under Rosso or Primaticcio scattered the classic norms and
ideals through France; and these remained dominant there for centuries,
along with the corresponding classic literary forms inaugurated by the
Pleiade. Excited by Serlio and Vitruvius, French artists like Jacques A.
du Cerceau, Jean Bullant, and Delorme went to Italy to study the remains
of Roman architecture, and, returning, wrote treatises formulating
classic ideas. Like Ronsard and Du Bellay, they condemned medieval
styles as bar- barous, and resolved to chasten matter into form. Through
these men, their work, and their books, the architect emerged as an
artist distinct from the master-mason, and standing high in the social
scale. Italian artists were no longer needed in French building, for
France now went beyond Italy to ancient Rome itself for architectural
inspiration, and effected a superb syn- thesis of the classic orders
with the traditions and climate of France.</p>
<p>In this milieu of thought and art the noblest civic building in
France took form. Viewing the Louvre today from the left bank of the
Seine, or standing in its majestic courts, or wandering day after day
through this treasure house of the world, the spirit shrinks with awe at
the immensity of the monument. If, in some universal devastation, only
one building might be spared, we should choose this. Philip Augustus had
raised its first form about 1 191 as a fortress castle to guard Paris
against invasion along the Seine. Charles V had added two new wings
(1357), with an external staircase that may have sug- gested the gem at
Blois. Finding this medieval structure, half palace and half prison,
inadequate for his residence and entertaining, Francis had it torn</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 827</p>
<p>down, and commissioned Pierre Lescot (1546) to raise in its place a
chateau fit for a French Renaissance king. When, a year later, Francis
died, Henry II bade the enterprise go on.</p>
<p>Lescot was a noble and a priest, Sieur de Clagny, Abbe of Clermont,
canon of Notre Dame, painter, sculptor, architect. He it was who
designed the rood loft in the church of St.- Germain l’Auxerrois (des
troyed in 1745), and the palace that is now the Hotel Carnavalet. In
both of these tasks he enlisted the aid of his friend Jean Goujon for
decorative sculpture; and when work on the new Louvre had made some
progress he called upon Goujon to come and adorn it. In 1 548 Lescot
raised the western wing of the palaces that now enclose the Cour Carree
or Square Court of the Louvre. The style of the Italian Renaissance
dictated the facade from ground to roof — exclusively, as Rabelais might
say: three tiers of rectangular windows, the tiers separated by marble
cornices, the windows separated by classic columns; three porches
sustained by elegant classic pillars; only the sloping roof was French,
and there too the moldings were of classic grace. The general aspect
would have been too severe had not Goujon inserted statues in the niches
of the porticoes, and carved exquisite reliefs in the pediments and
beneath the cornices, and crowned the central projection with the emblem
of Henry and Diana. Within this Lescot wing Goujon built the Salle des
Cariatides — four stately females upholding a gallery for musicians; and
it was again Goujon who decorated the vault of the great staircase that
led to the royal chamber where slept the kings of France from Henry IV
to Louis XIV. The work on the Louvre continued under Charles IX, Henry
IV, Louis XIII and XIV,</p>
<p>Napoleon I and III, always faithful to the style set by Lescot and
Goujon, until today the spreading edifice is the congealed essence of
350 years of a civilization that ground the toil of the people into the
splendors of art. Would the Louvre have been possible if the aristocracy
had been just?</p>
<p>For Henry II and Diane de Poitiers Philibert Delorme created
architec- tural Edens. As a youth Philibert studied and measured the
remains of classic Rome; he loved them, but, back in France, he
announced that henceforth French architecture must be French. His spirit
of classic idolatry and French patriotism was precisely the program of
the Pleiade. He designed the horse- shoe stairway in the Cour des Adieux
at Fontainebleau, and the fireplace and coffered ceiling in the Gallery
of Henry II. For Diane he built at Anet</p>
<p>(1548-53) a veritable city of palaces and formal gardens; there
Cellini placed in a pediment his Nymph of Fontainebleau , and Goujon
surpassed the Florentine with his group of Diana and her stag. Most of
this costly para- dise has gone to ruin; an unimpressive gateway remains
in the court of the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. For the same
triumphant mistress Delorme completed Chenonceaux — a little gift from
her enamored King; it was Philip who conceived the idea of extending the
palace across the Cher. When</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>Catherine de Medicis took the chateau from Diane, Delorme continued
to labor there till the masterpiece was complete. For a time his
too-mathemati- cal style fell from favor, and he retired to write an
encyclopedic Treatise on Architecture. In his old age he was called back
to work by Catherine, and designed for her a new palace, the Tuileries
(1564-70), which the Commune of 187 1 destroyed. From all his patrons he
received rich rewards. He became a priest, and held several fruitful
benefices. He died (1570) as a canon of Notre Dame, and provided in his
will for two illegitimate children. 2 * * * * * * 9</p>
<p>Jean Bullant completed the brilliant trio of architects who adorned
France in the reigns of Catherine’s husband and sons. In his th irties,
at Ecouen, he made his reputation by designing for Anne de Montmorency a
chateau quite perfect in its classic lines. In his sixties he succeeded
Delorme in building the Tuileries, and continued working till his death
— de jour en jour en apprenant mourant, as he said — “From day to day,
while learning dying.”</p>
<p>It is the fashion to regret the importation of Italian styles into
French building, and to suggest that the native Gothic, left undeflected
by that influ- ence, might have evolved into a civic architecture more
congenial to French grace than the relatively rigorous lines of the
classic orders. But Gothic was dying of old age, perhaps of senile
excess and Flamboyant old lace; it had run its course. The Greek
emphasis on restraint, simplicity, stability, and clear structural lines
was well suited to temper French exuberance into disci- plined maturity.
Some medieval quaintness was sacrificed, but that too had had its day,
and seems picturesque precisely because it died. As French Renaissance
architecture developed its own national character, mingling dormer
windows and sloping roofs with columns, capitals, and pediments, it gave
France for three centuries a style of building that was the envy of
Western Europe; and now that it too is passing away we perceive that it
was beautiful.</p>

<li>The Ancillary Arts</li>
</ol>
<p>A thousand artist-artisans adorned French life in this vivacious age
of</p>
<p>Frangois Premier and Henri Deux. Woodworkers carved the choir stalls
of</p>
<p>Beauvais, Amiens, Auch, and Brou, and dared to decorate Gothic
structures</p>
<p>with a Renaissance play of fauns, sibyls, bacchants, satyrs, even,
now and</p>

pursuit-</p>
<p>tables, chairs, frames, prie-dieu, bedsteads, and cabinets, carving
them with</p>
<p>perhaps a plethora of ornament, and sometimes inlaying them with
metal, ivory, or precious stones. The metalworkers, now at the crest of
their excel- lence, glorified utensils and weapons with damascening or
engraving, and designed grilles — poems in iron tracery — for chapels,
sanctuaries, gardens, and tombs, or made such hinges as those on the
west doors of Notre Dame,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 829</p>
<p>so beautiful that piety ascribed them to angelic hands. Cellini, who
had little praise left for others after meeting his own needs, confessed
that in making church plate — or such domestic plate as Jean Duret
engraved for Henry li- the French goldsmiths had “attained a degree of
perfection nowhere else to be found.” 10 The stained glass in Margaret
of Austria’s chapel at Brou, or in St.- Etienne’s at Beauvais, or in
St. -Etienne-du-Mont at Paris, proclaimed a glory not yet departed. At
Fontainebleau Francis established a factory in which tapestries were
woven in one piece, instead of being made, as before, in separate
sections, then sewn together; and gold and silver threads were mingled
opulently with dyed silk and wool. After 1530 the patterns and subjects
of French tapestry ceased to be Gothic and chivalric, and followed
Renaissance designs and themes from Italy.</p>
<p>Renaissance motives dominated ceramics in the majolica of Lyons, the
faience of southern France, the enamels of Limoges. Leonard Limousin and
others painted, with brilliant fused enamel colors, elegant forms of
plants and animals, gods and men, on copper basins, vases, ewers, cups,
saltcellars, and other lowly utensils raised to works of art. Here too
Francis took a hand, made Leonard head of the royal manufactory of
enamels at Limoges, and crowned him with the title of valet de chambre
du roi. Leonard special- ized in painting portraits in enamel on copper
plates; an excellent sample- portraying Francis himself — is in the
Metropolitan Museum at New York; many more are in the Apollo Gallery of
the Louvre, quietly attesting a golden day.</p>
<p>Portraiture was a fully developed art in France before the Italians
came. Which of the Italians in France could have bettered the portrait
of Guillaume de Montmorency painted by an anonymous master about 1520,
and now in the Lyons Museum? V oilcL un homme ! — this is no pictorial
compliment, it is a man. Rosso, Primaticcio, de ll’Abbate, and others in
the School of Fontaine - bleau brought to France what they had learned
from Raphael, Perino del Vaga, Giovanni da Udine, or Giulio Romano, in
decorating pilasters, cor- nices, ceilings . . . with “grotesques” or
playful figures o f cherubs, children, spirals, arabesques, and plants.
An unnamed member of the school painted the Diane de Poitiers now in the
Worcester, Massachusetts, Museum — sitting at her toilette, dressed in a
diadem. After 1 545 many Flemish painters, in- cluding Brueghel the
Elder, came to France to study the work at Fontaine- bleau. But their
own style was too deeply rooted to yield to the Italian influence; the
realistic vigor of their portraiture prevailed over the feminine grace
of the heirs of Raphael.</p>
<p>One Flemish family in France almost constituted a school by itself.
Jean (Jehan, Jehannet, Janet) Clouet was attached to the court of
Francis at Tours and Paris; all the world knows the portrait he painted
of the King</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>830</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>about 1525, now in the Louvre: proud, conceited, happy royalty just
before a fall. Jean’s son Frangois Qouet succeeded him as court painter,
and re - corded the dignitaries of four reigns in chalk or oil. His
Henry II surpasses his father ’s Francis I: we are astonished to see the
chasm between the gay gallant and the somber son; we can understand how
this man could sanction the chambre ardente for the persecution of
heresy, though we do not see in the almost Borgian face any hint of his
lasting devotion to Diane. For a time Corneille de Lyon, operating a
rival atelier, challenged the Clouets in such portraits as that of
Marechal Bonnivet, lover of Marguerite. But no contem- porary in France
could equal the gallery of portraits that Francois Clouet made of
Catherine de Medicis, Francis II, Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth of
Valois, Philip II, Marguerite, future wife of Henry IV, and Charles IX
as a youth — too lovely to forecast the frightened King of the Massacre.
Flemish realism and veracity are in these portraits tempered with French
delicacy, precision, and vivacity; the tone is subdued, the line is
accurate and confident, the elements of a complex character are caught
and unified; only Holbein’s England would enjoy such a color ful
historian.</p>
<p>Sculpture was a handmaiden to architecture, and yet it was the
sculptors who made the architecture brilliant. Now, indeed, French
sculpture poured forth masterpieces only second to those that
Michelangelo and others were then cutting out of Carrara. Lordly tombs
were modeled: of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany by Giovanni di Giusto
Betti (Saint-Denis); of two</p>
<p>Cardinals of Amboise by Roland Leroux and Jean Goujon (Rouen) ; and
of Louis de Breze, Diane’s husband, in the same cathedral, of uncertain
authorship. The Rouen tombs seem too ornate to befit mortality, but the
cardinals are almost revived as unidealized strong administrators to
whom religion was an incident in statesmanship. Francis I, his wife
Claude, and his daughter Charlotte were buried in Saint-Denis in a tomb
of Renaissance style designed by Delorme, with superb sculptures by
Pierre Bontemps. Near by is a little chef- d’oeuvre by Bontemps— a
funerary urn for the heart of the King. French sculptors no longer
needed Italian tutelage to inherit the classic art of Rome.</p>
<p>Jean Goujon inherited at least the classic grace. We hear of him
first in 1 540, listed as a “stonecutter and mason” in Rouen. There he
cut the columns supporting the organ in the church of St.-Maclou, and
carved statues for the tombs of the Cardinals, and perhaps for that of
Breze. He adorned the rood screen in the church of St.- Germain 1
’Auxerrois with sculptures now partially preserved in the Louvre, and
recalling Hellenistic reliefs in the rhythmic elegance of their lines.
Goujon’s characteristic quality of feminine grace approached perfection
in the Nymphs that he contributed to the “Fountain of the Innocents”
designed by Lescot (1547 ); Bernini thought</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 83 1</p>
<p>these figures the most beautiful works of art in Paris. We have noted
Gou- jon’s Diana and the Stag at Anet, and his sculptures on the Louvre.
His pagan deities and his idealization of the female form suggest, for
France, the triumph of the Renaissance over the Reformation, of
classical over Gothic ideas, of woman over her medieval detractors.
However, tradition describes Goujon as a Huguenot. About 1542, as
penance for attending a Lutheran sermon, he was condemned to walk
through the streets of Paris in his shirt, and to witness the burning of
a Protestant preacher. 11 Toward 1562 he left France for Italy. He died
at Bologna before 1 568, in obscurity hardly merited by the man who had
brought to its culmination the art of the Renaissance in France.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PIETER BRUEGHEL: 1 5 20-69</li>
</ol>
<p>Except for Brueghel and tapestry this was a fallow age in Lowland
art. Paint- ing fluctuated between emulation of the Italians — in
refined technique, rich coloring, classic mythology, nude women, and
Roman architectural backgrounds — and the native flair for realistic
portrayal of eminent persons and ordinary things. Patronage came not
only from the court, the Church, and the aristocracy, but increasingly
from rich merchants who offered their stout forms and over- flowing
jowls to the admiration of posterity, and liked to see reflected in
painting the domestic scenes and rural landscapes of their actual life.
A sense of humor, sometimes of the grotesque, replaced the lofty mood of
the Italian masters. Michelangelo criticized what seemed to him a lack
of discrimination and nobility in Flemish art: “They paint in Flanders
only to deceive the external eye, things that gladden you . . . the
grass of the fields, the shadows of the trees, and bridges and rivers .
. . and little objects here and there . . . without care in selecting
and rejecting.” 12 To Michelangelo art was the selection of sig
nificance for the illustration of nobility, not the indiscriminate
representation of reality; his solemn nature, encased in his irremovable
boots and his misanthropic isola- tion, was immune to the glory of green
fields and the affections of the hearth.</p>
<p>For our part we make a grateful bow to Joachim Patinir, if only for
the Leonardesque landscape in his St. Jerome; to Joos van Cleve for his
lovely portrait of Eleanor of Portugal; to Bernaert van Orley for his
Holy Family in the Prado, his tapestry designs, and his stained glass in
Brussels’ St. -Gudule; to Lucas van Leyden for crowding so many masterly
engravings and woodcuts into his thirty-nine years; to Jan van Scorel
for the Magdalen cherishing the vase of ointments from which she had
bathed the feet of Christ; and to Anthonis Mor for his forceful
portraits of Alva, Cardinal Granvelle, Philip II, Mary Tudor, and, not
least, himself.</p>
<p>Note how the painting craft in the Netherlands ran in families. Joos
van Cleve handed down some of his skill to his son Cornelis, who painted
some fine por- traits before going mad. Jan Massys, inheriting the
studio of his father Quentin, painted by preference nudes like Judith
and Suzanna and the Elders; his son</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>832</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>Quentin Massys II carried on the trade, while his brother Comelis
took his art to England and painted Henry VIII in old age, bloated and
hideous. Pieter Pourbus and his son Frans painted portraits and pieties
at Bruges, and Frans’s son Frans Pourbus II painted portraits at Paris
and Mantua. And there were Pieter “Droll” Brueghel, his painter wife,
his painter mother -in-law, his sons Pieter “Hell” Brueghel and Jan
“Velvet” Brueghel, his painter grandsons, his painter great-grandsons. .
. .</p>
<p>Pieter Brueghel the Elder, whose fame is among the inescapable
fashions of our time, may have derived his name from either of two
villages named Brueghel in Brabant; one of them was near Hertogenbosch,
where Hie- ronymus Bosch had been born, and in whose churches Pieter
might have seen several paintings of the man who influenced his work
only less than nature itself. At twenty-five (c. 1545) he migrated to
Antwerp, and was appren- ticed to Pieter Coecke, whose landscape
woodcuts may have helped to form the young painter’s interest in fields,
woods, waters, and sky. This lesser Pieter had begotten a daughter,
Maria, whom Brueghel toddled in his arms as a child, and whom he later
made his wife. In 1552 he followed the current custom of his craft and
went to study painting in Italy. He returned to Ant- werp with a
sketchbook thick with Italian landscapes, but with no visible Italian
influence on his technique; to the end he practically ignored the subtle
modeling, chiaroscuro, and coloratura of the southern masters. Back in
Ant- werp, he lived with a housekeeper-concubine, whom he promised to
marry when she stopped lying; he recorded her lies with notches cut into
a stick; and having no stick for his own sins, he renounced her when the
notches overflowed. In his middle forties (1563) he married Maria
Coecke, now seventeen, and obeyed her summons to move to Brussels. He
had only six years of life left to him.</p>
<p>Though his paintings led to his being dubbed “Peasant Brueghel,” he
was a man of culture, who read Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Rabelais,
probably Erasmus. 13 Karel Mander, the Dutch Vasari, described him as
“tranquil and orderly, speaking little, yet amusing in company,
delighting to horrify peo- ple .. . with tales of ghosts and banshees”;
14 hence, perhaps, his other sobriquet, “Droll Brueghel.” His sense of
humor leaned to satire, but he tem - pered this with sympathy. A
contemporary engraving shows him heavily bearded, with a face bearing
lines of serious thought. 15 At times he followed Bosch in seeing life
as a heedless hurrying of most souls to hell. In the Dulle Griet he
pictured hell as hideously and confusedly as Bosch himself; and in The
Triumph of Death he visioned death not as a natural sleep of exhausted
forms, but as a ghastly cutting off of limbs and life — skeletons
attacking kings, cardinals, knights, and peasants with arrows, hatchets,
stones, and scythes — criminals beheaded or hanged or bound to a wheel —
skulls and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 833</p>
<p>corpses riding in a cart; here is one more variant of that: “Dance of
Death” which flits through the art of this somber age.</p>
<p>Brueghel ’s religious pictures carry on the serious mood. They have
neither the grandeur nor the light grace of Italian pictures; they
merely reinterpret the Biblical story in terms of Flemish climate,
physiognomy, and dress. They rarely reveal religious feeling; most of
them are excuses for painting crowds. Even the faces in them carry no
feeling; the people who jostle one another to see Christ carry His cross
seem heedless of His suffering, but only anxious to get a good view.
Some of the pictures are Biblical parables, like The Sewer; some others,
following Bosch, take proverbs for their themes. The Blind Leading the
Blind shows a succession of dull-eyed peasants, cruelly ugly, following
one another into a ditch; and Netherlandish Proverbs illustrates, in one
teeming picture, nearly a hundred old saws, including some of Rabe-
laisian fragrance.</p>
<p>Brueghel’s major interest was in peasant crowds, and landscapes
covering with their indifferent beneficence or maleficence the futile,
forgivable activi- ties of men. Perhaps he thought there was safety in
crowds; there he need not individualize the faces or model the flesh. He
refused to picture a person posing for art or history; he preferred to
show men, women, and children walking, running, jumping, dancing,
playing games, in all the varied anima- tion and naturalness of life. He
harked back to the scenes of his childhood, and delighted to
contemplate, to join, the fun and feasting, music and mat- ing, of the
peasantry. He and a friend, on several occasions, disguised them- selves
as farmers, attended village fairs and weddings, and — pretending to be
relatives — brought presents to bridegroom and bride . 16 Doubtless on
these outings Pieter took his sketchbook, for among his extant drawings
are many of rustic figures and events. He had no taste for, nor
commissions from, the aristocrats that Mor and Titian found it so
profitable to portray; he painted only simple people, and even his dogs
were mongrel curs that could be found in any city alley or rural hut. He
knew the bitter side of peasant life, and sometimes visioned it as a
multitudinous confusion of fools. But he loved to paint the games of
country children, the dances of their elders, the riot of their
weddings. In The Land of Cockayne peasants exhausted with toil or love
or drink sprawl out on the grass dreaming of Utopia. It is the peasant,
Brueghel seems to say, who knows how to play and sleep as well as how to
work and mate and die.</p>
<p>Against death he saw but one consolation — that it is an integral
part of that Nature which he accepted in all its forms of beauty and
terror, growth and decay and renewal. The landscape redeems the man; the
absurdity of the part is pardoned in the majesty of the whole.
Heretofore — excepting Alt- dorfer — landscapes had been painted as
backgrounds and appendages to human figures and events: Brueghel made
the landscape itself the picture, the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>men in it mere incidents. In The Fall of Icarus the sky, the ocean,
die moun- tains, and the sun have absorbed the attention of the painter,
and of the participants; Icarus is two unnoticed legs ridiculously
sinking into the sea; and in The Storm man is hardly visible, lost and
helpless in the war and power of the elements.</p>
<p>The art and philosophy of Brueghel culminate in the five paintings
that remain of a series planned to illustrate the moods of the year. The
Wheat Harvest schematically pictures the cutting and stacking of the
sheaves, the workers lunching or napping beneath the visible heat and
stillness of the summer air. In The Hay Harvest girls and boys bear the
autumn fruit of the fields in baskets on their heads, a farmer sharpens
his scythe, sturdy women rake the hay, men pitch it to the top of the
wagon load, the horses champ their meal in a resting interval. The
Return of the Herd heralds winter — the skies darkling, the cattle
guided back to their stalls. Finest of the series is The Hunters in the
Snow: roofs and ground are white; dwellings range in an amazing
perspective along the plains and hills; men skate, play hockey, fall on
the ice; hunters and their dogs start out to capture food; the trees are
bare, but birds in the branches promise spring. The Gloomy Day is winter
scowling its farewell. In these paintings Brueghel reached his peak, and
set a precedent for the snowy landscapes of future Lowland art.</p>
<p>Only a painter or a connoisseur can judge these pictures in their
artistic quality and technique. Brueghel seems content to give his
figures two dimen- sions, does not bother to mingle shadow with their
substance; he lets our imagination, if it must, add a third dimension to
his two. He is too interested in crowds to care about individuals; he
makes nearly all his peasants alike, ungainly lumps of flesh. He does
not pretend to be a realist, except in gross. He puts so many people or
episodes into one painting that unity seems sacrificed; but he catches
the unconscious unity of a village, a crowd, a wave of life.</p>
<p>What does he mean to say? Is he merely jesting, laughing at man as a
grotesque “forked radish,” and at fife as a silly strutting to decay? He
en - joyed the lusty swing of the peasants’ dance, sympathized with
their toil, and looked with indulgent humor on their drunken sleep. But
he never recovered from Bosch. Like that unsaintly Jerome, he took
sardonic pleasure in depicting the bitter side of the human comedy — the
cripples and criminals, the defeated or obscene, the inexorable victory
of death. He seems to have searched for ugly peasants; he caricatures
them, never lets them smile or laugh; if he gives their crude faces any
expression it is one of dull indiffer- ence, of sensitivity beaten out
by the blows of life . 17 He was impressed and hurt by the apathy with
which the fortunate bear the misery of the unfor- tunate, the haste and
relief with which the living forget the dead. He was op- pressed by the
vast perspective of nature — that immensity of sky under which</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 835</p>
<p>all human events seem drowned in insignificance, and virtue and vice,
growth and decay, nobility and ignominy alike seem lost in a vast and
indiscriminate futility, and man is swallowed up in the landscape of the
world.</p>
<p>We do not know if this was Brueghel’s real philosophy, or merely the
playfulness of his art. Nor do we know why he gave up the battle so
soon, dying at forty-nine (1569); perhaps more years would have softened
his wrath. He bequeathed to his wife an ambiguous picture, The Merry Way
to the Gallows , a masterly composition in fresh greens and distant
blues, peasants dancing near the village gibbet, and, perched on this, a
magpie, emblem of a chattering tongue.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>CRANACH AND THE GERMANS</li>
</ol>
<p>German ecclesiastical architecture went in hiding during the
Reformation. No new churches were raised to art as well as piety; many
churches were left unfinished; many were pulled down, and princely
castles were put together with their stones. Protestant churches
dedicated themselves to a stern simplicity; Catholic churches, as if in
defiance, ran to excessive ornament while the Renais- sance moved into
the baroque.</p>
<p>Civic and palace architecture replaced cathedrals as dukes replaced
bishops and the state enveloped the Church. Some picturesque civic
structures of this period were casualties of the second World War: the
Althaus in Brunswick, the House of the Butchers’ Guild at Hildesheim,
the Renaissance -style Rathaus or Town Hall of Nymegen. The most
pretentious architecture of this and the next age took the form of
immense castles for the territorial princes: Dresden Castle, which cost
the people 100,000 florins (,500,000?); the palace of Duke Christopher
at Stuttgart’, so lavish in fixtures and furniture that the city magis-
trates warned the Duke that the luxury of his court was scandalously in
contrast with the poverty of his people; and the vast Heidelberg Castle,
begun in the thirteenth century, rebuilt in Renaissance fashion in
1556-63, and partly de- stroyed in the second World War.</p>
<p>The art crafts retained their excellence in the service of princes,
nobles, merchants, and financiers. Cabinetmakers, woodcutters,
ivory-cutters, engravers, miniaturists, textile workers, ironworkers,
potters, goldsmiths, armorers, jewelers — all had the old medieval
skills, though they tended to sacrifice taste and form to complexity of
ornament. Many painters drew designs for woodcuts as carefully as if
they were making portraits of kings; and woodcutters like Hans
Lutzeburger of Basel labored with the devotion of a Diirer. The
goldsmiths of Nuremberg, Munich, and Vienna were at the top of their
line; Wenzel Jamnitzer might have challenged Cellini. About 1547 German
artists began to paint glass with enamel colors; in this way vessels and
windows took on crude but rich designs, and the prosperous bourgeois
could have his likeness fused into the windowpanes of his home.</p>
<p>836 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>German sculptors kept their preference for metal statuary and
reliefs. The sons of Peter Vischer carried on his craft: Peter the
Younger cast a bronze plaque of Orpheus and Eurydice ; Hans designed a
handsome Apollo Fountain for the court of the Nuremberg town hall; Paul
is usually credited with a pretty figure in wood, known as The Nuremberg
Madonna . Peter Flotner of Nurem- berg cast excellent reliefs of Envy,
Justice, Saturn, and the Muse of Dance. One of the most delightful
objects in the Louvre is a bust, by Joachim Deschler, of Otto Heinrich,
Count Palatine, six and a half inches high, and nearly as wide in its
corpulence, with a face formed by years of bon appetit; this is German
humor at its broadest.</p>
<p>The glory of German art continued to be in painting. Holbein equaled
Diirer, Cranach followed on their heels, and Baldung Grien, Altdorfer,
and Amberger formed a creditable second line. Hans Baldung Grien made
his fame with an altarpiece for the cathedral of Freiburg-im-Breisgau;
but more attractive is The Madonna ’with the Parrot — a buxom Teuton
with golden hair, and a parrot pecking at her cheeks. Christopher
Amberger painted some elegant portraits; the Lille Museum has his
Charles V, sincere, intelligent, incipiently fanatical; the Chicago Art
Institute’s Portrait of a Ma?i is a finely chiseled, gentle face.</p>
<p>Lucas Cranach the Elder took his name from his native town, Kronach,
in Upper Franconia. We know almost nothing further of him till his
appoint- ment, at the age of thirty-two, as court painter to Elector
Frederick the Wise at Wittenberg (1504). He kept his position at the
Saxon court, there or a Weimar, for nearly fifty years. He met Luther,
liked him, pictured him again and again, and illustrated some of the
Reformer’s writings with cari - catures of the popes; however, he made
portraits also of Catholic notables like the Duke of Alva and Archbishop
Albrecht of Mainz. He had a good business head, turned his studio into a
factory of portraits and religious paint- ings, sold books and drugs on
the side, became burgomaster of Wittenberg in 1565, and died full of
money and years.</p>
<p>The Italian influence had by this time reached Wittenberg. It appears
in t he grace of Cranach’s religious pictures, more visibly in his
mythologies, most in his nudes. Now, as in Italy, the pagan pantheon
competes with Mary, Christ, and the saints, but German humor enlivens
the traditional by making fun of safely dead gods. I n Cranach’s
Judgment of Paris the Trojan seducer goes to sleep while the shivering
beauties wait for him to wake and judge. In Venus and Cupid the goddess
of love is shown in her usual nudity, except for an enormous hat — as if
Cranach were slyly suggesting that desire</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 837</p>
<p>is so formed by custom that it can be stilled by an unwonted
accessory. Nevertheless Venus proved popular, and Cranach, with help,
issued her in a dozen forms to shine in Frankfurt, Leningrad, the
Borghese Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. … In Frankfurt she
hides her charms re- vealingly behind a dozen gossamer threads; these
serve again for the Lucretia in Berlin, who cheerfully prepares to
redeem her honor with a bare bodkin. The same lady posed for The Nymph
of the Spring (New York), lying on a bed of green leaves beside a pool.
In the Geneva Museum she becomes Judith, no longer nude, but dressed to
kill, holding her sword over Holo- fernes’ severed head, which winks
humorously at its mischance. Finally the lady, re-bared, becomes Eve in
Das Paradies at Vienna, in Adam and Eve at Dresden, in Eve and the
Serpent in Chicago, where a handsome stag joins and names her party.
Nearly all these nudes have some quality that saves them from eroticism
— an impish humor, a warmth of color, an Italian finesse of line, or an
unpatriotic slenderness in the female figures; here was a brave attempt
to reduce the Frau.</p>
<p>The portraits that pou red from Cranach’s hand or aides are more
interest - ing than his stereotyped nudes, and some rival Holbein’s.
Anna Cuspinian is realism tempered with delicacy, gorgeous robes, and a
balloon hat; the husband, Johannes Cuspinian, sat for a still finer
portrait — all the idealism of a young humanist reflected in the
meditative eyes and symbolized in the book fondly clasped. A hundred
dignitaries were preserved in paint or chalk in this popular atelier ,
but none so well deserves survival as the child Prince of Saxony
(Washington), all innocence and gentleness and golden curls. At the
other side of life is the portrait of Dr. Johannes Schoner, terrible in
features, noble in art istry. And here and there, in Cranach’s work, are
magnificent animals, all pedigreed, and stags so natural that — claimed
a friend —“dogs barked when they saw them.” 18</p>
<p>Cranach might have been greater had he not succeeded so soon and
well. The multiplication of his patrons divided his genius; he had no
time to give all of it to any one task. Inevitably, as his eighty-one
years rolled by, he tired and slacked down; the drawing, once as fine as
Diirer’s, became careless, details were shirked, the same faces, nudes,
and trees were repeated to life- lessness. In the end we have to agree
with the judgment passed on the early Cranach by the aging Diirer — that
Lucas could depict the features but not the soul. 19</p>
<p>In 1550, when he was seventy-eight, he painted his own portrait: a
stout councilor and merchant rather than painter and engraver, with
powerful square head, stately white beard, expansive nose, eyes full of
pride and char- acter. Three years later he surrendered his flesh to
time. He left behind him three sons, all artists: John Lucas, Hans, and
Lucas the Younger, whose Sleeping Hercules transmitted a theme from
Rabelais to Swift by showing</p>
<p>838 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>the giant peacefully ignoring the darts with which the pigmies around
him barely pierce his ectoderm. Perhaps Lucas the Elder ignored as
serenely the pricks of those who condemned him for bourgeois ideals and
unconscientious haste; and under the tombstone that bears the ambiguous
compliment Celer- rhnus pictor — fastest painter — he sleeps well.</p>
<p>With him the great age of German painting passed. The basic cause of
the decline was more probably the intensity of religious dispute than
the Protestant repudiation of religious imagery. Possibly a moral
letdown coars- ened German painting after 1520; nudes began to play a
leading role; and even in Biblical pictures painters ran to themes like
Suzanna and the Elders, Potiphar’s wife tempting Joseph, or Bathsheba in
her bath. For two cen - turies after the death of Cranach German art
receded in the backwash of theology and war.</p>
<p>V. THE TUDOR STYLE: 1517-58</p>
<p>The reign of Henry VIII began with a Gothic masterpiece in the chapel
of Henry VII, and closed with the Renaissance architecture of royal
palaces; the change of style aptly reflected the conquest of the Church
by the state. The attack of the government on the bishops, the
monasteries, and ecclesi- astical revenues put an end to English
ecclesiastical architecture for almost a hundred years.</p>
<p>Henry VII, anticipating death, had allotted £ 140,000 (4,000,000?) to
build in Westminster Abbey a Lady Chapel to contain his tomb. It is a
masterpiece not of construction but of decoration, from the cenotaph
itself to the intricate stone skein of the fan vault, which has been
called “the most wonderful work of masonry ever put together by the hand
of man.” 20 As the chapel is Gothic in plan and Renaissance in
adornment, we have here the beginning of the Tudor or Florid Style.
Henry VIII, as a young human- ist, was readily won to classical
architectural forms. He and Wolsey brought several Italian artists into
England. One of them, Pietro Torrigiano, was commissioned to design the
paternal tomb. Upon the sarcophagus of white marble and black stone the
Florentine sculptor laid lavish decoration in carvings or gilt bronze:
plump putti, floral wreaths of airy grace, reliefs of the Virgin and
divers saints, angels sitting atop the tomb and extending pretty feet
into space, and, over the whole, the recumbent figures of Henry VII and
his Queen Elizabeth. This was such sculpture as England had never seen
before, and in England it has never been surpassed. Here, said Francis
Bacon, the parsimonious King, who had pinched pennies to spend pounds,
’d welle th more richly dead than he did alive in any of his palaces.”
21</p>
<p>Henry VIII was not the man to allow anyone to be more sumptuously
buried than himself. In 1518 he contracted to pay Torrigiano £ 2,000
for</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 839</p>
<p>a tomb “more greater by the fourth part” than his father’s. 22 This
was never finished, for the artist as well as the King had a royal
temper; Torrigiano left England in a huff (1519), and when he returned
he did no more work on the second tomb. Instead he designed for Henry
VII’s chapel a high altar, rere - dos, and baldachin, which Cromwell’s
men destroyed in 1643. In 1521 Torrigiano departed for Spain.</p>
<p>The mortal comedy was resumed in 1524 when Wolsey commissioned
another Florentine, Benedetto da Rovezzano, to build him a tomb in
St. George’s Chapel at Windsor, “the design whereof,” wrote Lord
Herbert</p>
<p>Aside from these labors, and the glorious wood screen and stalls and
stained glass and vault of King’s College Chapel at Cambridge, the memo
- rable architecture of this age was dedicated to glorifying the country
houses of the aristocracy into fairy palaces rising amid the fields and
woods of Eng- land. The architects were English, but a dozen Italians
were enlisted for the decoration. An imposingly wide fagade in mixed
Gothic and Renaissance, a turreted gateway leading into a court, a
spacious hall for crowded fes- tivities, a massive staircase, usually in
carved wood, rooms adorned with murals or tapestry and lighted with
lattice windows or oriels, and, around the buildings, a garden, a deer
park, and, beyond, a hunting ground — this was the English nobleman’s
skeptical forestalling of paradise.</p>
<p>The most famous of these Tudor manor houses was Hampton Court, built
by Wolsey (1515) for himself, and bequeathed in terror to his King
(1525). Not one architect but a coalition of English master builders
created it, basically in Perpendicular Gothic and on a medieval plan,
with moat and towers and crenellated walls; Giovanni da Maiano added a
Renaissance touch in terra-cotta roundels on the fagade. The Duke of
Wiirttemberg, visiting England in 1 592, called Hampton Court the most
magnificent palace in the world. 24 Only less sumptuous were Sutton
Place in Surrey, built (152 1-27) for Sir Richard Weston, and Nonesuch
Palace, begun for Henry VIII in 1538 on an imperial scale. “He invited
thither,” says an old description, “the most excellent artificers,
architects, sculptors, and statuaries of different na- tions, Italians,
Frenchmen, Hollanders, and native Englishmen; and these presented a
marvelous example of their art in the decoration of the palace.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>840</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>and both within and without adorned it with statues which here recall
in literal reproduction the ancient works of Rome, and elsewhere surpass
them in excellence.” 26 Two hundred and thirty men were constantly
employed on this palace, which was intended to outshine the Chambord and
Fontaine- bleau of Francis I. Seldom had English kings been so rich, or
the English people so poor. Henry died before Nonesuch could be
finished. Elizabeth made it her favorite residence; Charles II gave it
to his mistress Lady Castle- maine (1670), who had it pulled down, and
sold the parts, as the only way to transform a liability into an
asset.</p>

<li>HOLBEIN THE YOUNGER: 1 497- 1 543</li>
</ol>
<p>How futile are words before a work of art! Each art successfully
resists translation into any other medium; it has its own inalienable
quality, which must speak for itself or not at all. History can only
record the masters and the masterpieces; it cannot convey them. To sit
silently before Holbein’s pic - ture of his wife and children is better
than a biography. However . . .</p>
<p>He was more fortunate in his parentage than in his time. His father
was among the leading painters in Augsburg. From him Hans learned the
ele- ments of the art, and from Hans Burgkmair something of Italian
grace and modeling. In 1 5 1 2 he painted four altar panels now in the
Augsburg Gallery — middling enough, but astonishingly good for a lad of
fifteen. Two years later he and his brother Ambrose, also a painter,
decamped to Basel. Perhaps the father had insisted too much on his own —
still Gothic — style; perhaps there was not enough educated money in
Augsburg to support more than a few artists; in any case youth and
genius seldom love home. In Basel the lads discovered that freedom is a
trial. Hans illustrated various volumes, in- cluding Erasmus’ Praise of
Folly; he did some rough painter’s work, made a signboard for a
schoolmaster, and decorated a table top with lively inci- dents from the
story of St. Nobody — that handy nonentity who was charged with every
anonymous mischief, and never said a word in his own defense. The skill
shown in this work earned Hans a fruitful commission — to paint
portraits of the burgomaster Jakob Meyer and his wife (1517). The fame
of these portraits traveled; Jakob Hertenstein called Holbein to
Lucerne, and there Hans frescoed the fagade and walls of the patron’s
home, and painted that portrait of Benedict Hertenstein which is now in
the Metropolitan Museum in New York. From Lucerne he may have passed
into Italy; his work henceforth revealed Italian influence in anatomical
accuracy, architec- tural backgrounds, and the management of light. When
he returned to Basel, aged twenty-two, he set up his own studio, and
married a widow (1519). In that year his brother died and in 1524 their
father.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 841</p>
<p>German realism mingled with Romanesque architecture and classic orna-
ment in the religious pictures that Holbein now produced. Startling is
the realism — echoing Mantegna — of Christ in the Tomb: the body all
bone and skin, the eyes ghastly open, the hair disheveled, the mouth
agape in a last ef- fort to breathe; this seems irrevocable death, and
no wonder Dostoievski said the picture could destroy a man’s religious
faith. 28 About this time Holbein painted murals for the hall of the
Grand Council in Basel. The coun- cilors were pleased, and one of them
commissioned him to provide an altar- piece for a Carthusian monastery.
This Passion of Christ suffered in the iconoclastic riots of 1529, but
two shutters were saved, and were presented to the cathedral at
Freiburg-im-Breisgau. They borrow much from Baldung Grien, but they have
their own power in the remarkable play of the light that emanates from
the Child. In 1522 the town clerk of Basel ordered an- other altarpiece;
for this placidly beautiful Madonna, now preserved in the Kunstmuseum of
Solothurn, Holbein used his wife and son as models — the wife then a
woman of modest comeliness, not yet touched by tragedy. Prob- ably near
this time 27 he produced his religious masterpiece, The Virgin and Child
with the Family of Burgomaster Meyer — splendid in composition, line,
and color, and intense in feeling; we understand more sympathetically
the Burgomaster’s prayer to the Madonna when we learn that at t he time
of this painting the two sons pictured at his feet, and one of the two
wives kneel- ing at the right, were dead.</p>
<p>But the fees for such religious pictures were small in proportion to
the care and labor they required. Portraits were more lucrative, and
there was a growing family to support. In 1519 Holbein painted the young
scholar Bonifacius Amerbach — a noble face, in which idealism survives a
penetrating</p>
<p>About 1523 Holbein painted himself, now twenty-six, and seemingly</p>
<p>842 the reformation (chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>prosperous; but the cold glance suggests some fighting resentment of
life’s bufferings. Tradition discredits him with a moderate addiction to
drink and women, and represents him as unhappy with his wife. Apparently
he shared some Lutheran views; his woodcuts of The Dance of Death ( c .
1525) sati- rized the clergy — but even the clergy did that in those
days. The series showed Death dogging the steps of every man, woman, or
class — Adam, Eve, the Emperor, a noble, a physician, a monk, a priest,
a pope, a millionaire, an astrologer, a duchess, a jester, a gambler, a
thief — all en route to the Last Judgment; it is as powerful a work as
any of Diirer’s in this medium. Aside from this masterpiece of drawing,
and the Meyer Madonna, Holbein is with- out visible piety. Perhaps he
imbibed some skepticism from Erasmus and the Basel humanists. 29 He was
more interested in anatomy than in religion.</p>
<p>The Reformation, though he presumably favored it, ruined his market
in Basel. No more religious pictures were asked of him. Payments on the
paintings for the council hall were suspended. Rich men, frightened by
the Peasants’ War, retreated into privacy and parsimony, and thought the
time unpropitious for portraits. “Here the arts are freezing,” wrote
Erasmus from Basel in 1526. 80 He gave Holbein letters of introduction
to friends in Ant- werp and London, and Holbein, leaving his family at
home, sought fortune in the north. He visited Quentin Massys, and
doubtless they exchanged notes about Erasmus. From Antwerp he crossed to
England. Erasmus’ letter assured him a cordial welcome from Thomas More,
who gave him a place in his Chelsea home; and there he painted (152 6)
the portrait of More that is now in the Frick Gallery in New York. To
the hindsight of the historian the tense and half-somber eyes foreshadow
the devotion and tenacity of the martyr; to the insight of an artist the
wonder will be in the fur and folds of the sleeve. In 1527 Holbein
painted Thomas More and His Family — the old- est known group picture in
transalpine secular art.</p>
<p>Late in 1528 Holbein, having made some pounds and shillings, returned
to Basel, gave Erasmus a copy of More and His Family, and rejoined his
wife. Now he painted one of his greatest, most honest pictures, showing
his own family with a realism unsparing to himself. Each of the three
faces is sad: the girl resigned, almost hopeless; the boy gazing up
plaintively at his mother; she looking upon them with grief and
affection profoundly mirrored in her eyes — the grief of a wife who has
lost the love of her husband, the affection of a mother whose children
are her only tie to life. Three years after paint- ing this masterly
self-indictment, Holbein left his family again.</p>
<p>During this stay in Basel he painted another portrait of Froben, and
made six more of Erasmus, not as searchingly profound as those of
1523-24. The town council renewed his commission to fresco its chambers,
but, yield- ing to the triumphant iconoclasts, it condemned all
religious pictures, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 843</p>
<p>ruled that “God has cursed all those who make them.” 81 Commissions
fell, and in 1532 Holbein returned to England.</p>
<p>There he painted portraits so plentifully that most of the figures
domi- nating the English scene in those turbulent years are still alive
by the magic of Holbein’s hand. In the Queen’s Library at Windsor are
eighty -seven sketches in charcoal or chalk, some for cartoons, most of
them for portraits; apparently the artist required only one or two
sittings from his subjects, and then painted their likeness from such
sketches. The Hanseatic merchants in London solicited his art, but did
not inspire his best. For the Guildhall of the Hanse he painted two
murals preserved only in copies or drawings: one represented The Triumph
of Poverty, the other The Triumph of Riches; both are marvels of
individualized character, living movement, and coherent design, and
illustrate the motto of the Guild — “Gold is the father of joy and the
son of care; he who lacks it is sad, he who has it is uneasy.” 82</p>
<p>Thomas Cromwell, who was to exemplify this adage, submitted his hard
face and soft frame to Holbein’s brush in 1 534. Through him the artist
found access to the highest figures at the court. He painted The French
Ambas- sadors, and one of them, Charles de Saulier, he portrayed with
especial suc- cess, revealing the man beneath the vestments and insignia
of office. Four others — Sir Henry Guilford (controller of the royal
household), Sir</p>
<p>Nicholas Carew (royal equerry to the King), Robert Cheseman (royal
fal- coner to the King), and Dr. John Chambers (physician to the King) —
sug- gest the thick skins that alone could safely live near the
parboiled King, Holbein became one of them about 1 5 3 7 as official
court painter. He received a workshop of his own in Whitehall Palace,
dwelt in comfort, had mistresses and bastards like anybody else, and
dressed in color and silk. 88 He was called upon to decorate rooms,
design ceremonial garments, bookbindings, weap- ons, tableware, seals,
royal buttons and buckles, and the gems that Henry presented to his
wives. In 1 53 8 the King sent him to Brussels to paint Princess
Christine of Denmark; she proved quite charming, and Henry would gladly
have had her, but she took Duke Francis of Lorraine instead; perhaps she
preferred to hang in a gallery rather than die on the block. Holbein
took the opportunity to visit Basel briefly; he arranged an annuity of
forty guilders (,000?) for his wife, and hurried back to London. Soon
thereafter came the commission to paint Anne of Cleves; Holbein almost
foreshadowed the result in the sad eyes of the portrait now in the
Louvre.</p>
<p>For the King himself he painted several large pictures, nearly all
lost. One survives in the Barber Surgeons’ Hall in London: Henry VIII
Granting a Charter of Incorporation to the Barber Surgeons’ Company;
Henry domi - nates the scene in his robes of state. The artist made
appealing portraits of Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour, and the fifth
wife, Catherine Howard. When Henry himself sat or stood for Holbein the
painter rose to the chal-</p>
<p>844 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>lenge, and produced portraits surpassed in his own work only by the
Louvre and Basel pictures of Erasmus. The portrait of 1536 shows the
monarch Teutonically pompous and stout. Henry liked it despite himself,
and com- missioned Holbein to paint the royal family as a fresco in
Whitehall Palace; this mural was destroyed by fire in 1698, but a copy
made in 1667 for Charles II reveals a masterly design: at the upper left
Henry VII, pious and modest; lower, his son, brandishing the symbols of
power and spreading his legs like a colossus; at the right his mother
and his third wife; and in the center a marble monument retailing in
Latin the virtues of the kings. The figure of Henry VIII was elaborated
with such realism that a legend arose about per- sons entering the room
and mistaking the portrait for the living King. In 1540 Holbein painted
a still more imposing Henry VIII in Wedding Dress. Finally (1542) he
displayed Henry in the deterioration of mind and body. Nemesis here
worked leisurely, lengthening the revenge of the gods from clean or
sudden death to prolonged and ignominious decay.</p>
<p>Two lovely pictures redeem the royal gallery: one of Prince Edward at
the age of two, all innocence; the other of Edward aged six (in the
Metro- politan Museum of Art). This second portrait is a delight to
behold. We may judge the art of Holbein when we see him, within a year
or two, portray unflinchingly the obese pride of the father, and then
catch with such myste- rious skill the guileless kindliness of the
son.</p>
<p>At forty-five ( 1 542 ) the artist pictured himself again, and with
the same objectivity with which he had depicted the King: a suspicious,
pugnacious fellow with carelessly kept graying hair and beard; and once
more (1543) in a roundel showing him in a gentler mood. In that year
plague came to London, and chose him as one of its victims.</p>
<p>Technically he was one of the supreme painters. He saw meticulously,
and so portrayed; every line, color, or attitude, every incidence or
variation of light, that could reveal significance was caught and pinned
down upon the paper, linen, wood, or wall. What accuracy in the line,
what depth and smoothness and warmth in the color, what skill in
ordering details into a unified composition! But in many of the
portraits, where the object was not the subject but the fee, we miss the
sympathy that could see, and feel with, a man’s secret soul; we find it
in the Louvre and Basel Erasmus, and in the picture of his family. We
miss, except in the Meyer Madonna, the ideal- ism that ennobled the
realism in the Van Eycks’ Adoration of the Lamb. His indifference to
religion kept him short of the grandeur of Griinewald, and marked him
off from Diirer, who always had one foot in the Middle Ages. Holbein was
neither Renaissance like Titian nor Reformation like Cranach; he was
German-Dutch-Flemish-English matter-of-fact and practical sense. Perhaps
his success prevented the effective entry of Italian pictorial prin-
ciples and finesse into England. After him Puritanism triumphed over
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 845</p>
<p>Elizabethan passion, and English painting languished till Hogarth
came. At the same time the glory departed from German painting. A flood
of barba- rism would have to pass over Central Europe before the sense
of beauty would find voice there again.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ART IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL: 1 5 1 5 — 55</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite El Greco and Velazquez, Cervantes and Calderon, Spain never
had a Renaissance in the rich Italian sense. Her far-won wealth gave new
ornaments to her Christian culture, it offered productive rewards to
native genius in literature and art, but it did not flow into any
exciting recapture — as in Italy and France — of that pagan civilization
which had adorned the Mediterranean world before and after Christ, and
which had begotten Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Quintilian, Trajan, and
Hadrian on the soil of Spain itself. The remembrance of that classic era
had been deeply overladen by the long struggle of Spanish Christianity
with the Moors; all the glorious memo- ries were of that protracted
victory, and the faith that had won it became inseparable from the proud
remembrance. While everywhere else in Europe the state was humiliating
the Church, in Spain the ecclesiastical organization grew stronger with
the generations; it challenged and ignored the papacy, even when
Spaniards ruled the Vatican; it survived the pious absolutism of
Ferdinand and Charles V and Philip II, and then dominated every aspect
of Spanish life. The Church in Spain was almost the sole patron of the
arts; therefore it called the tune, named the themes, and made art, like
philosophy, the handmaiden of theology. The Spanish Inquisition
appointed inspectors to outlaw nudity, immodesty, paganism, or heresy in
art, to specify the man- ner of treating sacred subjects in sculpture
and painting, and to direct Spanish art toward the transmission and
confirmation of the faith.</p>
<p>And yet Italian influence was pouring into Spain. The rise of
Spaniards to the papacy, the conquest of Naples and Milan by Spanish
kings, the cam- paigns of Spanish armies and the missions of Spanish
statesmen and church- men in Italy, the busy trade between Spanish and
Italian ports, the visits of Spanish artists like Forment and the
Berruguetes to Italy, of Italian artists like Torrigiano and Leone Leoni
to Spain — all these factors affected Spanish art in methods, ornament,
and style, hardly in spirit or theme, more in paint- ing than in
sculpture, and in architecture least.</p>
<p>The cathedrals dominated the landscape and the towns as the faith
domi- nated life. Traveling in Spain is a pilgrimage from one to another
of these mighty fanes. Their awesome immensity, their wealth of interior
ornament, the dim-lit silence of their naves, the devoted stonework of
their cloisters, accentuate the simplicity and poverty of the
picturesque tiled dwellings that</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>846</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>huddle below, looking up to them as the promise of a better world.
The Gothic style still ruled in the giant cathedrals that rose above
Salamanca (1513) and Segovia (1522); but at Granada Diego de Siloe,
architect son of a Gothic sculptor, designed the interior of the
cathedral with classic columns and capitals, and crowned the Gothic plan
with a classic dome (1525). The style of the Italian Renaissance
completely dislodged Gothic in the palace of Charles V at Granada.
Charles had reproved the bishop of Cordova for spoiling the great mosque
by building within its 850 pillars a Christian church; 84 but he sinned
almost as grievously when he tore down some halls and courts of the
Alhambra to make room for a structure whose stern mass and dull symmetry
might have passed without offense amid kindred build- ings in Rome, but
proved strikingly out of harmony with the frail elegance and gay
diversity of the Moorish citadel.</p>
<p>Something of the Moors’ flair for architectural decoration appeared
in the “plateresque” style that marked chiefly the civil architecture of
this reign. It took its name from its resemblance to the complex and
delicate ornament lavished by the silversmith (platero) or goldsmith
upon plate and other objects of their art. It topped and flanked portals
and windows with winding arabesques of stone; it grooved or spiraled or
flowered columns with Moorish fantasy; it pierced grilles and
balustrades with marble foliage and embroidery. This plateresco marked
the Obispo Chapel at Madrid, the church of Santo Tomas at Avila, the
choir of the cathedral at Cordova, and it disported itself without
restraint on the Ayuntmniento or Town Hall of Seville (1526 f.).
Portugal adopted the style on a portal suffused with orna- ment, and
columns carved with decoration, in the magnificent monastery of Santa
Maria at Belem (1517 f.). Charles V took the style to the Lowlands and
Germany, where it flourished its signature on the town halls of Antwerp
and Leyden and the castle of Heidelberg. Philip II found plateresque too
florid for his taste, and under his frowns it died an early death.</p>
<p>Spanish sculpture yielded more readily than architecture to the
swelling Italian t ide. Pietro Torrigiano, after breaking Michelangelo’s
nose in Flor - ence and bearding Henry VIII in London, settled in
Seville (1521), and modeled in terra cotta an ungainly St. Jerome which
Goya mistakenly judged to be the supreme work of modem sculpture. 35
Feeling poorly paid for a statue of the Virgin, Torrigiano smashed it to
bits, was arrested by the Inquisition, and died in its jails. 38 Damian
Forment, returning to Aragon from Italy, carried the spirit of the
Renaissance on his chisel and in his boasts; he called himself “the
rival of Pheidias and Praxiteles,” and was accepted at his own estimate.
The ecclesiastical authorities allowed him to carve likenesses of
himself and his wife on the base of the reredos that he made for the
abbey of Monte Aragon. For the church of Nuestra Senora del Pilar at
Saragossa he cut in alabaster a spacious retable in bas-relief,
combining Gothic with</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) ART IN THE AGE OF HOLBEIN 847</p>
<p>Renaissance elements, painting with sculpture, color with form. To
anothei retable, in the cathedral of Huesca, Forment devoted the last
thirteen years of his life (1520-33).</p>
<p>As Pedro Berruguete had dominated Spanish painting in the
half-century before Charles V, so his son became the leading Spanish
sculptor of this age. Alonso learned the art of color from his father,
then went to Italy and worked with Raphael in painting, with Bramante
and Michelangelo in stat- uary. When he came back to Spain (1520) he
brought with him Michel- angelo’s penchant for figures caught in tense
emotion or violent attitudes. Charles appointed him court sculptor and
painter. At Valladolid he worked for six years carving in wood an altar
screen, forty-two by thirty feet, for the church of San Benito el Real;
only fragments remain, chiefly a San Sebastian vividly colored, with
blood pouring from the wounds. In 1535 he joined with his chief rival,
Felipe de Borgona, to carve choir stalls in the Toledo Cathedral; here
too the Michelangelesque manner swayed his hand, and presaged baroque in
Spain. When he neared eighty he was commissioned to erect in the
hospital of St. John at Toledo a monument to its founder, Cardinal Juan
de Tavera; he took his son Alonso as helper, created one of the chefs-
d’oeuvre of Spanish sculpture, and died in the attempt in his
seventy-fifth year (1561).</p>
<p>Spanish painting, still in tutelage to Italy and Flanders, produced
no out- standing master under Charles V. The Emperor favored foreign
painters, imported Anthonis Mor to make portraits of Spanish notables,
and for him- self declared that he would allow none but the great Titian
to paint him. The only Spanish painter of this age whose fame crossed
the Pyrenees was Luis de Morales. The first fifty years of his life were
spent in the poverty and obscurity of Badajoz, painting for churches and
chapels in the province of Estremadura. He was fifty-four when Philip II
bade him come and paint in the Escorial (1564). He presented himself in
magnificent array, which the King thought unbecoming in an artist, but
Philip softened when he learned that Luis had spent his life’s savings
to attire himself fitly for an audience with his Majesty. Morales’
Christ Carrying the Cross did not strike the royal fancy, and he
returned to Badajoz and penury. Several of his pic- tures can be seen at
the Hispanic Society in New York, all of them beautiful; but the best
example of his work is a Virgin and Child in the Prado — a bit too
redolent of Raphael. Philip, passing through Badajoz in 1581, allotted
the artist a tardy pension, which enabled him — now disabled by palsy
and failing eyes — to eat regularly during the five years left to him of
life.</p>
<p>The artisans of Spain were often artists in all but name. Spanish
lace and leather continued supreme in Europe. The woodworkers too were
unsur- passed; Theophile Gautier thought that Gothic art had never come
closer to perfection than in the choir stalls of Toledo Cathedral.
Metalworkers</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>848</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>made works of art out of sanctuary screens, window grilles, balcony
railings, door hinges, even nails. Goldsmiths and silversmiths
transformed some of the precious metal flowing in from America into
ornaments for princes and vessels for the Church; famous were the
custodias they made in filigree silver or gold to hold the consecrated
Host. Gil Vicente, not satisfied to be the leading dramatist of Portugal
and Spain in this period, executed a monstrance — for displaying the
Host to the congregation — which has been rated “the masterpiece of the
goldsmith’s work in Portugal.” 37 And Francisco de Hol - landa,
Portuguese despite his name, carried on with distinction the dying art
of illumination.</p>
<p>All in all, this less than half a century came off with credit in the
field of art despite the absorption and disruption of energies in the
religious revolu- tion. TTie masters in architecture, sculpture, and
painting were hardly com- parable to the giants who shook all Europe
with theology; religion was the tune of the time, and art could only
provide an accompaniment. But II Rosso, Primaticcio, Lescot, Delorme,
Goujon, and the Clouets in France, the Ber- ruguetes in Spain, Brueghel
in Flanders, Cranach in Germany, Holbein everywhere, made an honorable
roster of artists for an age so agitated and so brief. Art is order, yet
everytning was in chaos — not religion only, but morals, social order,
art itself. Gothic was fighting its losing battle with classic forms,
and the artist, uprooted from his own past, had to experiment with
