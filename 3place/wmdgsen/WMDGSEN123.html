<p>XXXThe Coming of Rome</p>
<p>I. PYRRHUS</p>
<p>*’TT THO is so worthless or indolent,” Polybius demands to know, “as
V V not to wish to understand by what means and under what system of
polity the Romans in less than fifty-three years have succeeded in sub-
jecting the whole inhabited world to their sole government — a thing
unique in history? Who is so passionately devoted to other studies as to
regard anything of greater moment than the acquisition of this
knowledge?’” It is a permissible inquiry, which may engage us later; but
there have been so many conquests since Polybius wrote that we cannot
spend much time on any of them. We have tried to show that the essential
cause of the Roman conquest of Greece was the disintegration of Greek
civilization from within. No great nation is ever conquered until it has
destroyed itself. Deforesta- tion and the abuse of the soil, the
depletion of precious metals, the migration of trade routes, the
disturbance of economic life by political disorder, the corruption of
democracy and the degeneration of dynasties, the decay of morals and
patriotism, the decline or deterioration of the population, the
replacement of citizen armies by mercenary troops, the human and
physical wastage of fratricidal war, the guillotining of ability by
murderous revo- lutions and counterrevolutions — all these had exhausted
the resources of Hellas at the very time when the little state on the
Tiber, ruled by a ruthless and farseeing aristocracy, was training hardy
legions of landowners, con- quering its neighbors and competitors,
capturing the food and minerals of the western Mediterranean, and
advancing year by year upon the Greek settlements in Italy. These
ancient communities, once proud of their wealth, their sages, and their
arts, had been impoverished by war, by the depredations of Dionysius I,
and by the growth of Rome as a rival center of trade. The native tribes
that, centuries before, had been enslaved by the Greeks or pushed back
into the hinterland, increased and multiplied while their masters
cultivated comfort through infanticide and abortion. Soon the native
stocks were contesting the control of southern Italy. The Greek cities
turned to Rome for help; they were helped, and absorbed.</p>
<p>659</p>
<p>66o THE LIFE OF GREECE ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXTaras, frightened by the growth of Rome, called to its aid the
dashing young king of Epirus. In that picturesque and mountainous
country, known to us as southern Albania, Greek culture had kept a
precarious footing ever since the Dorians had raised a shrine to Zeus at
Dodona.* In 295 Pyrrhus, who traced his ancestry to Achilles, became
king of the Molossians, the dominant Epirote tribe. He was handsome and
brave, a despotic but popular ruler. His subjects thought that he could
cure the spleen by pressing his right foot upon their prostrate backs;
nor was anyone so poor as to be refused his ministrations.“* When the
Tarentines appealed to him he saw an alluring opportunity: he would
conquer Rome, the danger in the West, as Alexander had conquered Persia,
the danger in the East; and he would prove his genealogy by his courage.
In 28 1 he crossed the Ionian (Adriatic) Sea with 25,000 infantry, three
thousand horse, and twenty elephants; the Greeks had taken elephants as
well as mysticism from India. He met the Romans at Heracleia, and won a
“Pyrrhic victory”: his losses were so great, and his resources in men
and materials were now so small, that when an aide complimented him on
his success he created an historic phrase by replying that another such
triumph would ruin him.® The Romans sent Caius Fabricius to treat with
him for an exchange of prisoners. At supper, says Plutarch, amongst all
sorts of things that were discoursed of, but more par-</p>
<p>ticularly Greece and its philosophers, Cineas 〔the Epirote
diplomat〕</p>
<p>spoke of Epicurus, and explained the opinions his followers hold</p>
<p>about the gods and the commonwealth, and the objects of life, plac-
ing the chief happiness of man in pleasure, and declining public</p>
<p>affairs as an injury and disturbance of a happy life, removing the
gods afar off both from kindness or anger, or any concern for us at all,
to</p>
<p>a life wholly without business and flowing in pleasures. Before
he</p>
<p>had done speaking, “O Hercules!” Fabricius cried out to Pyrrhus,</p>
<p>“may Pyrrhus and the Samnitest entertain themselves with opinions as
long as they are at war with us.”*</p>
<p>Impressed by the Romans, and despairing of adequate aid from the
Greeks of Italy, Pyrrhus dispatched Cineas to Rome to negotiate peace.
The Senate was about to agree when Appius Claudius, blind and dying, had
himself carried into the senate house and protested against making peace
with a foreign army on Italian soil. Frustrated, Pyrrhus fought again,
won another suicidal victory at Asculum, and then, hopeless of success
against Rome, sailed to Sicily with the generous resolve to free it from
the Carthaginians. There he drove the Cartha- ginians back with reckless
heroism; but whether it was that the Sicilian Greeks</p>
<p>• Italian archeologists in 1929 unearthed at Butrinto (the ancient
Buthrotum) numerous architectural and sculptural remains of Greek and
Roman civilization, including a Greek theater of the third century
b.c.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>were too timid to rally to him, or that he governed them as willfully
as any tyrant, he received so little support that he had to abandon the
island after a three years’ campaign, making the prophetic remark, “What
a battlefield I am leaving to Carthage and Rome!” Arriving with depleted
forces in Italy, he was defeated at Beneventum (275), where for the
first time the light-armed and mobile cohorts proved their superiority
to the unwieldy phalanxes, and thereby wrote a chapter in military
history.® Fyrrhus returned to Epirus, says the philo- sophical
Plutarch,</p>
<p>after he had consumed six years in these wars; and though unsuc-</p>
<p>cessful in his affairs, yet preserved his courage unconquerable among
all these misfortunes, and was held, for military experience and per-
sonal valor and enterprise, above all the other princes of his time;</p>
<p>but what he got by brave actions he lost again by vain hopes, and by
new desires of what he had not, kept nothing of what he had.®</p>
<p>Pyrrhus went out now to fresh wars, and was kiUed with a tile by an
old woman in Argos. In that same year (272) Taras yielded to Rome.</p>
<p>Eight years later Rome began her century-long struggle against
Carthage for the mastery of the western Mediterranean. After a
generation of fighting Carthage ceded to Rome Sardinia, Corsica, and the
Carthaginian portions of Sicily. In the Second Punic War Syracuse made
the mistake of siding with Carthage, whereupon Marcellus starved it into
surrender. The victors plundered the city so thoroughly that it never
recovered. Marcellus “removed to Rome,” says Livy, “the ornaments of
Syracuse— the statues and pictures in which it aboimded. . . . The
spoils were almost greater than if Carthage itself had been taken.’” By
210 all Sicily had fallen forfeit to Rome. The island was trans - formed
into a granary for Italy, and relapsed into an agricultural economy in
which nearly all the work was done by hopeless slaves. Industries were
discour- aged, trade was limited, wealth was sluiced off to Rome, and
the free population withered away. Sicily disappeared from the history
of civilization for a thou- sand years.</p>

<li>ROME THE LIBERATOR</li>
</ol>
<p>At every step the expansion of Rome was aided by the mistakes of her
enemies. In the year 230 two Romans were sent to Scodra, capital of
Illyria (northern Albania) to remonstrate against the attacks of
Illyrian pirates upon Roman shipping. Queen Teuta, who had been allowed
to share the spoils, answered that “it was contrary to the custom of the
Illyrian rulers to hinder their subjects from winning booty from the
sea.”® When one envoy threatened war Teuta had him killed. Pleased with
so inex-</p>
<p>662 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXpensive an excuse for seizing the Dalmatian coast, Rome dispatched
an ex- pedition which reduced Illyria to a Roman protectorate almost as
easily in 229B.C. asin A.D. 1939. Corcyra (Corfu), Epidamnus (Durazzo),
and other Greek settlements became Roman dependencies. Since Greek trade
had also suffered from Illyrian piracy, Athens, Corinth, and the two
leagues applauded Rome as a deliverer, accepted her ambassadors, and
admitted the Romans to participation in the Eleusinian mysteries and the
Isthmian games.</p>
<p>In 2 16 Hannibal annihilated the Roman army at Cannae, and marched up
to the gates of Rome. While Rome faced the greatest crisis in the
history of the republic, Philip V, Kdng of Macedon, signed an alliance
with Han- nibal and prepared to invade Italy (214). In the conference at
Naupactus ( 2 1 3 ) the Aetolian delegate Agelaus appealed for the unity
of all Greeks, in this First Macedonian War, against the rising power in
the west:</p>
<p>It would be best of all if the Greeks never made war upon each</p>
<p>other, but regarded it as the highest favor in the gift of the
gods</p>
<p>could they always speak with one heart and voice, and marching</p>
<p>arm in arm like men fording a river, repel barbarian invaders and</p>
<p>unite in preserving themselves and their cities. . . . For it is
evident</p>
<p>that whether the Carthaginians beat the Romans or the Romans the
Carthaginians in this war, it is not in the least likely that the
victors</p>
<p>will be content with the sovereignty of Italy and Sicily, but they
are</p>
<p>sure to come here and extend their ambitions beyond the bounds of
justice. Therefore I implore you all to secure yourselves against
this</p>
<p>danger, and I address myself especially to King Philip. For you.
Sire,</p>
<p>the best security is, instead of exhausting the Greeks and making</p>
<p>them an easy prey to the invader, on the contrary to take thought for
them as for your own body, and to attend to the safety of every</p>
<p>province of Greece as if it were part and parcel of your own do-</p>
<p>minions.’</p>
<p>Philip heard him politely, and became for a moment the idol of
Greece. But his treaty with Hannibal, if we may believe the too
patriotic Livy, specified that in return for Philip’s attack upon Italy,
Carthage, if success - ful in the present war, would help Philip to
subdue all mainland Greece to Macedonia.” Perhaps because the terms of
such an agreement became</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE COMING OF ROME 663</p>
<p>to Hannibal, and three years later the elder Scipio overwhelmed the
Car- thaginian at Zama. As the last great century of Greek civilization
came to an end Egypt, Rhodes, and Pergamum appealed to Rome for help
against Philip. Rome responded by inviting the Second Macedonian War.
Op- posed by nearly all of Greece as well as by Rome, Philip fought with
the ferocity of a beast at bay. He used every treachery, stole whatever
he found to his purpose, and treated captives with such cruelty that
every man in Abydos, when Philip’s siege was provi ng irresistible,
killed his wife and children and then himself In 197 Titus Quinctius
Flamininus, a patrician of the type that made Polybius a pro-Roman
enthusiast, so overwhelmed Philip at Cynoscephalae that suddenly all
Macedonia — indeed, all Greece- lay at the mercy of Rome. To the disgust
of his Aetolian allies (who</p>
<p>claimed that they had won the battle), Flamininus, after exacting
severe indemnities and appropriating a shipload of spoils, allowed the
safely weakened Philip to keep his throne, on the ground that Macedonia
was needed as a bulwark against the barbarians in the north.</p>
<p>The Roman general had learned Greek at Tarentum (as Rome called
Taras), and had known the fascination of Greek hterature, philosophy,
and art. It was apparently his sincere resolve to liberate the Greek
city-states from Macedonian domination, and to give them every
opportunity to live in freedom and peace. Having with some difficulty
convinced the Roman commissioners that this was a wise policy, he went
to the Isthmian games at Girinth (196), where all the important Greek
world was gathered (each man telhng the next, says Polybius, what the
Romans would do now) , and announced through a herald; “The Senate of
Rome, and Titus Quinctius the proconsul, having overcome King Phihp and
the Macedonians, leave the following people free, without garrisons,
subject to no tribute, and gov- erned by their own laws: the
Corinthians, Phocians, Locrians, Euboeans, Phthiotic Achaeans,
Magnesians, Thessalians, and Perrhaebian s”— i.e., all those mainland
Greeks who were not already free. The greater part of the assemblage,
unable to credit so unprecedented an act of liberality, cried out that
the announcement should be repeated. When the herald read it again,
“such a mighty burst of cheering arose,” says Polybius, “that those who
listen to the tale today cannot easily conceive what it was.”“ Many
doubted the sincerity of the declaration, and looked for a trick behind
it; but Fla- mininus that day began the removal of Roman troops from
Corinth, and by 194 his entire army was back in Italy. Greece hailed him
as “Savior and Liberator,” and entered happily upon its last days of
freedom.</p>
<p>664</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXin. ROME THE CONQUEROR</p>
<p>The Aetolians were not satisfied with these arrangements. Some of the
cities that Rome had freed had once been under Aetolian domination, and
were not now restored to the League. The Second Macedonian War was
hardly over when the Aetolians invited Antiochus III to rescue Greece
from Rome. Pergamum and Lampsacus, caught between the restless Gauls on
the north and the expanding Seleucid power on the south, appealed to
Rome for help against Antiochus. The Senate sent its ablest general,
Publius Scipio Africanus, victor of Zama. With a few legions and the
troops of Eumenes II, the Roman generals defeated Antiochus at Magnesia,
and turning north- ward, drove back the Gauls. The Romans extended their
protection over nearly all the Mediterranean coast of Asia, and then
returned to Italy. Eumenes was grateful, but mainland Greece denounced
him as a traitor to Hellas for calling in the barbarous Romans against
his fellow Greeks.</p>
<p>For fickle Greece already regretted that she had ever accepted the
favors of her rude rescuer from the west. It was observed that though
Flamininus and his successors had given Greece freedom, they had taken
in payment — from any city that had supported Philip or Antiochus or the
Aetolians — so much booty that the Greeks dreaded another such
liberation. For three days, in Flamininus’ triumph, the spoils of his
Grecian campaign passed in continuous train before the eyes of Rome: on
the first day arms, armor, and innumerable statues of marble or bronze;
on the second day 18,000 pounds of silver, 3,714 pounds of gold, and
100,000 silver coins; on the third day 1 14 coronets.” Moreover, the
Romans had supported, and now through their representatives continued
actively to support, the moneyed classes in Greece against the poorer
citizens, and had forbidden all manifestations of class war. The Greeks
did not want peace at such a price; they wished to be free to settle
their own disputes, and to give play to national territorial ambitions;
they could not bear changelessness. Soon the rival leagues were at odds,
and faction ran rife everywhere. Each city or group laid conflicting
claims before the Roman Senate; the Senate dispatched commissions to in-
vestigate and adjudicate; the Greeks denounced this interference as vas-
salage. The chains of foreign control were invisible but real; year
after year the Greeks — all but the rich — felt them more sharply, and
prayed for an end to this freedom. The Senate began to listen to those
of its members who contended that there would never be order or quiet in
Greece until Rome took full control.</p>
<p>In 179 Philip V died, and his eldest son Perseus, not without
bloodshed.</p>
<p>THE COMING OF ROME</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>66 his throne. Seventeen years of peace had restored the economy of
Macedon, and had raised up a fresh generation of youths for the jaws of
war. Perseus negotiated an alliance with Seleucus IV, and married
Seleucus’ daughter; Rhodes joined the alliance, and sent a great fleet
to escort the bride. All Greece rejoiced, and saw in Perseus a living
hope against the power of Rome. Eumenes II, fearful for the independence
of Pergamum, journeyed to Rome and urged the Senate, for its ovra sake,
to destroy Macedon. On his way home he was almost killed in a private
quarrel. It suited Rome to interpret the brawl as a plot of Perseus to
assassinate the king; and a patriotic exchange of diplomatic
recriminations announced the Third Macedonian War. Only Epirus and
Illyria had the courage to help Perseus; the Greek states sent him
secret letters of sympathy, but did noth- ing. In 1 68 Aemilius Paulus
annihilated the Macedonian army at Pydna, destroyed seventy Macedonian
cities, banished their upper classes to Italy, and quartered the kingdom
into four autonomous but tributary republics, among which all trade and
intercourse were forbidden. Perseus was im- prisoned in Italy, and died
of maltreatment in two years. Epirus was devas- tated, and 100,000
Epirots were sold into slavery at a dollar a head.“ Rhodes, which had
played no active part in the war, was punished by the liberation of her
possessions on the Asiatic coast, and by the establishment of a com-
petitive and free port at Delos. The private papers of Perseus were cap-
tured, and all Greeks who had offered him aid or comfort were banished
or jailed. A thousand of the Achaean League’s most prominent representa
- tives, including Polybius, were deported to Italy; they remained in
exile there for sixteen years, during which seven hundred of them died.
The ad- miration of Greece for Rome the liberator had never been so
intense as was now the Greek hatred of Rome the conqueror.</p>
<p>The severity of the victors had unwilled results. The weakening
of</p>
<p>Rhodes ended her policing of the Aegean, and revived a
trade-destroying piracy. The removal of so many aristocrats left the
field open to radical leadership in the cities of the Achaean League,
and the class war enjoyed one of its bitterest periods. The rich clung
to the protection of Rome, the poor demanded the expulsion both of the
rich and of the Roman power. In 150 the surviving Achaean exiles
returned from Italy, and joined in the demand for the repudiation of
Roman authority in Greece. To weaken the Achaean power Rome sent to
Greece a commission that ordered Corinth, Orchomenos, and Argos to
secede from the League. The ladies of Corinth replied by emptying pails
of refuse upon the heads of the commissioners.” In 146 the League voted
for a war of liberation, hoping that Rome’s cam -</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXpaigns in Spain and Africa would divert her energies and incline
her to a complaisant peace. A fever of patriotism swept the cities of
the League. Slaves were freed and armed, a moratorium on debts was
proclaimed, and land was promised to the poor, while the unhappy rich,
trembling between socialism and Rome, reluctantly contributed their
jewelry and their money to the cause of freedom. Athens and Sparta
remained aloof, but Boeotia, Locria, and Euboea committed themselves
bravely to the war. The repub- lics of Macedonia joined in open revolt
against Rome.</p>
<p>The angry Senate sent over an army under Mummius and a fleet under
Metellus. Their combined forces overcame all resistance, and in 146 Mum-
mius captured Corinth, the citadel of the League. Whether to destroy a
commercial rival in the east as the younger Scipio was in that year
destroy- ing Carthage in the west, or to give rebellious Greece a lesson
after the fashion of Alexander at Thebes, the rich city of merchants and
courtesans was put to the flames, all the men were slaughtered, and all
the women and children were sold into slavery. Mummius carried off to
Italy whatever wealth could be moved, including the works of art with
which the Corinthi- ans had adorned their cities and their homes.
Polybius tells how Roman soldiers used world-famous paintings as boards
for their games of draughts or dice. The League was dissolved, and its
leaders were put to death. Greece and Macedonia were united into one
province under a Roman gov- ernor. Boeotia, Locris, Corinth, and Euboea
were subjected to annual tribute; Athens and Sparta were spared, and
were allowed to remain under their own laws. The party of property and
order was upheld everywhere, and all attempts to wage war, or make
revolutions, or change the constitu- tion, were proscribed. The
turbulent cities had at last found peace.</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>Our Greek Heritage</p>
<p>G reek civilization was not dead; it had yet several centuries of
life</p>
<p>before it; and when it died* it bequeathed itself in an incomparable
legacy to the nations of Europe and the Near East. Every Greek colony
poured the elixir of Greek art and thought into the cultural blood of
the hinterland — into Spain and Gaul, Etruria and Rome, Egypt and
Palestine, Syria and Asia Minor, and along the shores of the Black Sea.
Alexandria was the port of reshipment for ideas as well as goods: from
the Museum and the Library the works and views of Greek poets, mystics,
philosophers, and scientists were scattered through scholars and
students into every city of the Mediterranean concourse. Rome took the
Greek heritage in its Hellen- istic form; her playwrights adopted
Menander and Philemon, her poets imitated the modes, measures, and
themes of Alexandrian literature, her arts used Greek craftsmen and
Greek forms, her law absorbed the statutes of the Greek cities, and her
later imperial organization was modeled upon the Greco-Oriental
monarchies: Hellenism, after the Roman conquest of Greece, conquered
Rome even as the Orient was conquering Greece. Every extension of Roman
power spread the ferment of Hellenic civiliza- tion. The Byzantine
Empire wedded Greek to Asiatic culture, and passed on some part of the
Greek inheritance to the Near East and the Slavic north. The Syrian
Christians took up the torch and handed it to the Arabs, who carried it
through Africa to Spain. Byzantine, Moslem, and Jewish scholars conveyed
or translated the Greek masterpieces to Italy, arousing first the
philosophy of the Schoolmen and then the fever of the Renaissance. Since
that second birth of the European mind the spirit of Greece has seeped
so thoroughly into modem culture that “all civilized nations, in all
that con - cerns the activity of the intellect, are colonies of Hellas”
today.</p>
<p>If we include in our Hellenic heritage not only what the Greeks
in-</p>
<p>vented but what they adapted from older cultures and transmitted by
these</p>
<p>• We may arbitrarily date this at a.d. 325, when Constantine founded
Constantinople, and Christian Byzantine civil ization began to replace
the “pagan” Greek culture in the eastern</p>
<p>t Increased knowledge of Egyptian and Asiatic civilization compels
extensive modification of Sir Henry Maine’s classic hyperbole: “Except
the blind forces of nature, nothi ng moves in this world which is not
Greek m its origin.”*</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>diverse routes to our own, we shall find that patrimony in almost
every phase of modern life. Our handicrafts, the technique of mining,
the essen- tials of engineering, the processes of finance and trade, the
organization of labor, the governmental regulation of commerce and
industry — all these have come down to us on the stream of history from
Rome, and through Rome from Greece. Our democracies and our
dictatorships alike go back to Greek exemplars; and though the widened
reach of states has evolved a representative system unknown to Hellas,
the democratic idea of a govern- ment responsible to the governed, of
trial by jury, and of civil liberties of thought, speech, writing,
assemblage, and worship, have been profoundly stimulated by Greek
history. These things above all distinguished the Greek from the
Oriental, and gave him an independence of spirit and enterprise that
made him smile at the obeisances and inertia of the East.</p>
<p>Our schools and universities, our gymnasiums and stadiums, our
athletics and Olympic games, trace their lineage to Greece. The theory
of eugenic mating, the conception of self -containment and of
self-control, the cult of health and natural living, the pagan ideal of
a shameless enjoyment of every sense, found their historic formulations
in Greece. Christian theology and practice (the very words are Greek)
stem in large part from the mystery religions of Greece and Egypt, from
Eleusinian, Orphic, and Osirian rites; from Greek doctrines of the
divine son dying for mankind and rising from the dead; from Greek
rituals of religious procession, ceremonial purifica- tion, holy
sacrifice, and the sacred common meal; from Greek ideas of hell demons,
purgatory, indulgences, and heaven; and from Stoic and Neo-Pla- tonic
theories of the Logos, creation, and the final conflagration of the
world. Even our superstition is indebted to Greek bogies, witches,
curses, omens, and unlucky days. And who could understand English
literature, or one ode of Keats, without some tincture of Greek
mythology?</p>
<p>Our literature could hardly have existed without the Greek tradition.
Our alphabet came from Greece through Cumae and Rome; our language is
littered with Greek words; our science has forged an international
language through Greek terms; our grammar and rhetoric, even the
punctuation and paragraphing of this page, are Greek inventions. Our
literary genres are Greek–the lyric, the ode, the idyl, the novel, the
essay, the oration, the biography, the history, and above all the drama;
again nearly all the words are Greek. The terms and forms of the modem
drama — tragedy, comedy, and pantomime — are Greek; and though
Elizabethan tragedy is unique, the comic drama has come down almost
unchanged from Menander and Phile- mon through Plautus and Terence, Ben
Jonson and Moliere. The Greek dramas themselves are among the richest
portions of our inheritance.</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>OUR GREEK HERITAGE</p>
<p>669</p>
<p>Nothing else in Greece seems so foreign to us as its music; and yet
modem music (until its return to Africa and the Orient) was derived from
medieval chants and dances, and these went back in part to Greece. The
oratorio and the opera owe something to the Greek choral dance and
drama; and the theory of music, so far as we know, was first explored
and expounded by the Greeks from Pythagoras to Aristoxenus. Our debt is
least in painting; but in the art of fresco a direct line can be traced
from Polygnotus through Alexandria and Pompeii, Giotto and Michelangelo,
to the arresting murals of our own day. The forms and much of the
technique of modem sculpture are still Greek, for upon no other art has
the Hellenic genius stamped itself so despotically. We are only now
freeing ourselves from the fascination of Greek architecture; every city
in Europe and America has some temple of commerce or finance whose form
or columnar fagade came from the shrines of Greek gods. We miss in Greek
art the study of character and the por- trayal of the soul, and its
infatuation with physical beauty and health leaves it less mature than
the masculine statuary of Egypt or the profound paint- ing of the
Chinese; but the lessons of moderation, purity, and harmony em- bodied
in the sculpture and architecture of the classic age are a precious
heirloom for our race.</p>
<p>If Greek civilization seems more akin and “modem” to us now than
that</p>
<p>• Copernicus knew of Aristarchus’ heliocentric hypothesis, for he
mentioned it in a para - graph that disappeared from later editions of
his book.®</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>sophical theory, and ennobled it with an ethical code; Herophilus and
Erasistratus raised anatomy and physiology to a point which, except in
Galen, Eurojie would not reach again till the Renaissance. In the work
of these men we breathe the quiet air of reason, always uncertain and
unsafe, but cleansed of passion and myth. Perhaps, if we had its
masterpieces entire, we should rate Greek science as the most signal
intellectual achievement of mankind.</p>
<p>But the lover of philosophy will only reluctantly yield to science
and art the supreme places in our Grecian heritage. Greek science itself
was a child of Greek philosophy — of that reckless challenge to legend,
that youthful love of inquiry, which for centuries united science and
philosophy in one adventurous quest. Never had men examined nature so
critically and yet so affectionately: the Greeks did no dishonor to the
world in thinking that it was a cosmos of order and therefore amenable
to understanding. They in- vented logic for the same reason that they
made perfect statuary: harmony, unity, proportion, form, in their view,
provided both the art of logic and the logic of art. Curious of every
fact and every theory, they not only estab- lished philosophy as a
distinct enterprise of the European mind, but they conceived nearly
every system and every hypothesis, and left little to be said on any
major problem of our life. Realism and nominalism, idealism and
materialism, monotheism, pantheism, and atheism, feminism and com-
munism, the Kantian critique and the Schopenhaurian despair, the
primitiv- ism of Rousseau and the immoralism of Nietzsche, the synthesis
of Spencer and the psychoanalysis of Freud — all the dreams and wisdom
of philosophy are here, in the age and land of its birth. And in Greece
men not only talked of philosophy, they lived it: the sage, rather than
the warrior or the saint, was the pinnacle and ideal of Greek life.
Through all the centuries from Thales that exhilarating philosophical
bequest has come down to us, inspir- ing Roman emperors, Christian
Fathers, Scholastic theologians. Renaissance heretics, Cambridge
Platonists, the rebels of the Enlightenment, and the devotees of
philosophy today. At this moment thousands of eager spirits are reading
Plato, perhaps in every country on the earth.</p>
<p>Qvilization does not die, it migrates; it changes its habitat and its
dress, but it lives on. The decay of one civilization, as of one
individual, makes room for the growth of another; life sheds the old
skin, and surprises death with fresh youth. Greek civilization is alive;
it moves in every breath of mind that we breathe; so much of it remains
that none of us in one lifetime could absorb it all. We know its defects
— its insane and pitiless wars, its stagnant slavery, its subjection of
woman, its lack of moral restraint, its</p>

<p>OUR GREEK HERITAGE</p>
<p>671</p>
<p>corrupt individualism, its tragic failure to unite liberty with order
and peace. But those who cherish freedom, reason, and beauty will not
linger over these blemishes. They will hear behind the turmoil of
political history the voices of Solon and Socrates, of Plato and
Euripides, of Pheidias and Prax- iteles, of Epicurus and Archimedes;
they will be grateful for the existence of such men, and will seek their
company across alien centuries. They will think of Greece as the bright
morning of that Western civilization which, with all its kindred faults,
is our nourishment and our life.</p>

<p>The full title of a book is given only at the first reference to it.
Later references may be filled out by consulting the Bibliography. In
references to modern works a Roman number (in capitals) indicates the
volume, the Arabic number the page. In references to classical texts the
Roman number (in small letters) indicates the “book” or main division;
the Axabic number indicates the section, the marginal division, or the
verse. Where sections are long a subdivision is indicated by an Arabic
number after a period.</p>
