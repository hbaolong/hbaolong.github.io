to Stockholm</h4>
<p>I. THE SWISS: 1754-98</p>
<p>T HOSE of us who have enjoyed peace amid the scenic paradise of Swit-
zerland, and inspiration in the courage and integrity of its people,
find it difficult to realize that beneath the calm character, patient
husbandry, and steady industry that Europe admired then, and does now,
there lay the natural conflicts of race against race, language against
language, creed against creed, canton against canton, class against
class. On their modest scale the Swiss had very nearly realized the
ideal pictured by the Abbe de Saint-Pierre and dreamed of by Rousseau
and Kant: a confederation of states independ- ent in their internal
affairs but pledged to united action in their relations with the
surrounding world. In 1760 the Helvetic Union (Helvetische Gesell-
schaft) was formed to promote national rather than cantonal dedication,
and to unite the scattered movements for political reform.</p>
<p>Voltaire, living close by, estimated the population of Switzerland in
1767 at 720,000.’ Most of them tilled the soil or trained the vine,
terracing the slopes almost to the mountaintops. The textile industry
was growing, espe- cially in the province of St. Gallen and the canton
of Zurich; other manu- facturing centers were taking form in Glarus,
Bern, and Basel; and Geneva and Neuchatel were the great centers of
watchmaking. Agents spreading over Europe from London to Constantinople
(which had eighty-eight of them) developed for Geneva an export trade
that rapidly enriched the city on the Rhone. Banks multiplied, for the
Swiss financiers had won an inter- national reputation for fidelity.</p>
<p>As everywhere, the majority of abilities was contained in a minority
of men, and led to a concentration of wealth. Generally the cantons were
ruled by oligarchies, which behaved like any ruling class. The
patricians were gen- erous patrons of literature, science, and art, but
they resisted every move to extend the franchise. Gibbon, dwelling in
Lausanne, accused the Bernese oligarchy of discouraging industry in
their dependent provinces, and of keeping down the standard of living
there, on the principle that “poor and obedient subjects are preferable
to rich and recalcitrant ones.” 2 Societies for the abolition of
economic or political privilege were repeatedly organized, but were kept
in check by state and church allied. 3 Class war agitated Geneva, on and
off, throughout the eighteenth century. Relative peace pre- vailed there
from 1737 to 1762, but the burning of Emile by the municipal council
(1762) set off an agitation for widening the franchise. Rousseau and
Voltaire both aided this movement, and after much controversy the patri-
ciate yielded to the middle classes a minor share in the government.</p>
<p>This left quite voteless three fourths of the population — the
natifs, persons</p>
<p>643</p>
<p>644 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>born in Geneva but of non-native parents. These were excluded also
from most of the professions, from military office, and from mastership
in the guilds; and they were forbidden to address petitions to the Grand
Conseil and the Petit Conseil that ruled the republic. But they were
heavily taxed. On April 4, 1766, a delegation of natifs went to Ferney
and asked Voltaire to help them secure the franchise. He told them:</p>
<p>My friends, you constitute the most numerous class of an independent,
indus- trious community, and you are in slavery. You ask only to be able
to enjoy your natural advantages. It is just that you be accorded so
moderate a request. I shall serve you with all the influence I have;…
and if you are forced to leave a country which prospers through your
labor, I shall be able to serve and protect you elsewhere. 4</p>
<p>Aristocracy and bourgeoisie united to resist the appeal of the natifs
, and all that Voltaire could do was to welcome into his industrial
colony as many of the discontented artisans as came to him (1768). In
1782 the natifs rose in a revolt that overthrew the patriciate and
established a representative gov- ernment. But the aristocrats appealed
to France, Bern, and Sardinia; these powers intervened, the rebellion
was put down, the oligarchy was restored. The natifs had to wait for the
French Revolution to bring them freedom.</p>
<p>The cantons produced in this third of a century some personages of
inter- national renown. Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi was one of those rare
individ- uals who take the New Testament as a guide to conduct. He
agreed with Rousseau that civilization had corrupted man, but he felt
that reform could come not through new laws and institutions, but
through the remaking of hu- man conduct by education. All through his
life he welcomed children, espe- cially the poor and, above all, the
homeless; he gave them shelter and school- ing, and in their instruction
he applied the libertarian principles of Rousseau’s Smile, along with
some ideas of his own. He expounded his views in one of the most widely
read books of that generation. The heroine of Lionhard und Gertrud
(1781-87) reforms an entire village by trying to deal with people as
Christ would have done, and by educating her children with patient con-
sideration of their natural impulses and aptitudes. Pestalozzi proposed
to give the children as much freedom as the rights of others would
permit. Early education should begin by example, and should teach by
objects, the senses, and experience rather than by words, ideas, or
rote. Pestalozzi practiced his methods in various Swiss schools, chiefly
at Yverdon. There Talleyrand, Mme. de Stael, and others visited him, and
thence his theories spread through Europe. Goethe, however, complained
that Pestalozzi’s schools were form - ing insolent, arrogant, and
undisciplined individualists. 5</p>
<p>Angelica Kauffmann, born in the Grisons canton, rivaled A 4 me.
Vigee- Lebrun as the most renowned woman artist of their time. Even at
the age of twelve, besides being a good musician, she painted so well
that bishops and nobles sat to her for their portraits. At the age of
thirteen (1754) she was taken by her father to Italy, where she
continued her studies and was every- where feted for her accomplishments
and her personal charm. Invited to England in 1766, she made a stir by
her portrayal of Garrick. Sir Joshua</p>

<p>Reynolds became very fond of “Miss Angel,” painted her portrait, and
was painted in turn. She joined in the establishment of the Royal
Academy of Arts, which in 1773 appointed her, with others, to decorate
St. Paul’s. In 1781 she retired to Rome, where (1788) she numbered
Goethe among her devoted friends. She died there in 1807; her funeral,
arranged by Canova, was one of the events of the age; the entire art
community followed her to her tomb.</p>
<p>The outstanding Swiss of the generation after Rousseau was Johann
Kaspar Lavater. Born at Zurich in 1741, he became a Protestant pastor,
and retained throughout his life the most fervent attachment to orthodox
Chris- tianity. We have seen his attempts to convert Goethe and
Mendelssohn. But he was not dogmatic; he maintained friendships across
religious and national boundaries, and all who knew him respected him;
many loved him. 6 He wrote works of mystical piety, expounded the Book
of Revelations fanci- fully, believed in the miraculous powers of prayer
and Cagliostro, and gave his wife hypnotic treatments on prescriptions
by Mesmer. His most charac- teristic claim was that character can be
judged from the features of the face and the contours of the head. He
interested Goethe and Herder in his views, and they contributed articles
to his book Physiognomische Fragmente ( r 775-7 8). He studied the
looks, heads, and figures of prominent individuals, and correlated
cranial and facial features with specific qualities of mind and
character. His analyses and conclusions were widely accepted but are now
generally rejected; his general principle, that psychological qualities
share (with air, environment, diet, occupation, etc.) in molding the
body and the face, retains a substantial measure of truth. Every face is
an autobiography.</p>
<p>Lavater was part of a Swiss efflorescence which included Rousseau,
the poet and scientist Albrecht von Haller, the poet and painter Salomon
Gess- ner, the historian Johannes von Muller, and Horace de Saussure,
who started the sport of mountain climbing by scaling Mont Blanc in 1787
after twenty- seven years of trying. Meanwhile the cantons felt the
winds of revqlution blowing across the border from France. In 1797
Frederic Cesar de Laharpe, who had tutored the grandchildren of
Catherine the Great, joined with Peter Ochs, a guild merchant of Basel,
in calling upon the French Revolutionary government to help them
establish a democratic republic in Switzerland. Local revolts in Bern
and Vaud (January, 1798) paved the way; a French army crossed the
frontier on January 28; most of the Swiss population wel- comed it as a
li berator from oligarchy; on March 1 9 the “One and Indivisible
Helvetic Republic” was proclaimed, abolishing all privileges of canton,
class, or person, and making all Swiss equal before the law. Zurich
resisted longest, and in the turmoil that ensued honest old Lavater was
shot (1799). He died in 1801 as the slow effect of the wound.</p>

<p>Everybody liked the Dutch. The Danish dramatist Holberg, who visited
the United Provinces (“Holland”) and “Belgium” in 1704, enthused espe

<p>daily over their canals, whose boats, he said, “transport me from one
place to another” in dulcet peace, and “enable me to spend every night
in a town of considerable size, so that of an evening I have been able
to go to the opera or the theater directly upon arrival.” 7 Twelve years
later Lady Mary Wort - ley Montagu was similarly pleased:</p>
<p>The whole country [Holland] appears a large garden; the roads all
well paved, shaded on each side with rows of trees, and bordered with
large canals full of boats passing and repassing…. All the streets [in
Rotterdam]… so neatly kept that… I walked almost all over town
yesterday, incognita , in my slippers, without receiving one spot of
dirt; and you may see the Dutch maids washing the pavement… with more
application than ours do our bedcham- bers…. The merchants’ ships come
[on the canals] to the very doors of the houses. The shops and
warehouses are of a surprising neatness and magnifi- cence, filled with
an incredible quantity of fine merchandise. 8</p>
<p>But these rosy reports described Holland before she had felt the
economic effects of her victory over Louis XIV in the War of the Spanish
Succession. Then she had bled her men and money close to exhaustion; her
public debt was enormous; much of her carrying trade had been lost to
her military allies but commercial competitors — and to Germany. The
dividends of the Dutch East India Company fell from forty per cent in 1
7 1 5 to twelve and a half per cent in 1737, those of the Dutch West
India Company from five per cent in 1700 to two per cent in 1740. 9 The
Seven Years’ War brought further dam - age. The bankers of Amsterdam
grew rich on high interest loans to the war- ring powers, but the peace
of 1763 ended this boon, and many Dutch banks failed, leaving every
major business harmed. Boswell, in Holland in 1763, reported “many of
the principal towns sadly decayed….You meet with multitudes of poor
creatures who are starving in idleness.” 10 Taxes were raised, leading
to the emigration of capital and sturdy human stock; now Dutch and
German colonists mingled their blood in South Africa, slowly forming the
Boers.</p>
<p>Recovery came through Dutch character, industry, and integrity. A
calm, strong, frugal people tilled the land, oiled their windmills,
tended their cows, cleaned their dairies, and produced delectable
malodorous cheeses; Holland led Europe in scientific farming. 11 Delft
recaptured its market for porcelain. The Dutch and Jewish bankers of
Amsterdam regained their reputation for reliability and resourcefulness;
they lent at low interest and risk, received lucrative contracts to pay
and provision troops; governments and business applied to Amsterdam for
loans, and rarely went away empty; through nearly all that turbulent
century the bourse in Amsterdam was the financial center of the Western
world. Said Adam Smith about 1775: “The province of Holland,… in
proportion to the extent of its territory and the number of its people,
is a richer country than England.” 12</p>
<p>What most impressed Voltaire in 1725 13 was the almost peaceful
cohabi- tation of diverse faiths. Here were orthodox Catholics and
Jansenist Catho- lics (had not Jansen himself been Dutch?), Arminian
free-will Protestants and Calvinist predestination Protestants,
Anabaptists and Socinians, Mora-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI )</p>
<p>FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM</p>
<p>647</p>
<p>vian Brethren and Jews, and a sprinkling of freethinkers basking in
the French Enlightenment. 14 Most of the magistrates were Protestant,
but they “regularly took money from the Catholics,” says a Dutch
historian, “for conniving at their religious exerc ises, and allowing
them to hold office.” 15 The Catholics were now a third of the three
million population. The upper classes, acquainted through commerce with
a dozen faiths, were skeptical of them all, and did not allow them to
interfere with gambling, drinking, gour- mandizing, and some discreet
adultery in Gallic style. 16</p>
<p>French was the language of the cultured. Schools were numerous, and
the University of Leiden was famous for its courses in medicine, which
remem- bered the great Boerhaave. Nearly all towns had art societies,
libraries, and “chambers of rhetoric” with periodic contests in poetry.
Dutch art dealers had a European reputation for their treasures and
frauds. 17 The great age of Dutch painting had ended with Hobbema
(d. 1709), but Cornelis Troost was at least an echo of its glory.
Perhaps the most brilliant product of Dutch art in this age was glass
delicately stippled, or engraved with diamond points. 18 Amsterdam was a
nest of publishers, some of them gentlemen, some pirates. Creative
activity in literature sank to a low level in the first half of the
eighteenth century; but toward 1780 a revival of letters nourished a
real poet, Willem Bilderdijk.</p>
<p>One of Boswell’s friends told him that he would find the Dutch “hap
py in their own dullness”; 19 but Boswell reported from Utrecht: “We
have brilliant assemblies twice a week, and private parties almost every
evening…. There are so many beautiful and amiable ladies in our circle
that a quire of paper could not co ntain their praises.” 20 The most
fascinating pages in Boswell’s Holland jottings are those that describe
his hesitant romance with “Zelide,” or “Belle de Zuylen”— i.e., Isabella
van Tuyll. She belonged to an old and distinguished family; her father,
“l ord of Zuilen and West- broek,” was one of the governors of Utrecht
province. She received more education than she could hold, became
proudly heterodox, and flouted con- ventions, morals, religion, and
rank, but she charmed any number of men with her beauty, gaiety, and
exciting candor. She shrank from genteel and dutiful marriage. “If I had
neither father nor mother I would not get mar - ried…. I should be well
pleased with a husband who would take me as his mistress; I should say
to him, ‘Do not look upon faithfulness as a duty. You should have none
but the rights and jealousies of a lover.’” 21 To which Boswell, the
most assiduous fornicator in Europe, replied, “Fie, my Zelide, what
fancies are these?” She persisted: “I would prefer being my lover’s
laundress, and living in a garret, to the arid freedom and good manners
of our great families.” 22</p>
<p>Zelide passed through a succession of love affairs that left her
single and permanently scarred. Already at twenty-four she was quieting
her nerves with opium. At thirty (1771) she married Saint-Hyacinthe de
Charriere, a Swiss tutor, and went to live with him near Lausanne.
Finding him intellec- tually inadequate, she fell in love in her forties
with a man ten years younger than herself; he used her and left her. She
sought catharsis in writing a novel,</p>
<p>6 4 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>Caliste (1785-88), which sent Sainte-Beuve into raptures. At
forty-seven, in Paris, she met Benjamin Constant, aged twenty, and
seduced him with her mind (1787). “Mme. de Charriere,” he wrote, “had so
original and lively a manner of looking at life, so deep a contempt for
prejudice, so powerful an intellect, and so vigorous and disdainful a
superiority over the common run of men, that,… bizarre and arrogant like
her, I discovered in her con- versation a pleasure I had not known
before…. We became intoxicated with our scorn of the human race.” 23
This went on t ill 1794, when Benjamin found a fresh intoxication with
Mme. de Stael. Zelide retired into a bitter seclusion, and died at
sixty-five, having created and exhausted the emptiness of life.</p>
<p>She could have found food for pessimism in the political history of
the United Provinces in the eighteenth century. After the death of
William III (1702) the government was monopolized by an oligarchy of
business lead- ers devoted to taxation, nepotism, and intrigue. “The
citizens,” complained a Dutch writer in 1737, “are shut out of the
administration,… and no advice or vote is asked in affairs of state.” 24
The military incompetence of this regime was exposed when Holland
entered the War of the Austrian Succession (1743): a French army invaded
Holland, and met with little re- sistance; many towns surrendered
without argument; Marechal de Noailles reported, “We have to do with
some very obliging people.” 25 Not all; most of the citizens cried out
for a martial leader to save the country, as William III had done in
1672; his collateral descendant William IV, Prince of Or- ange, was made
stadholder of the seven provinces, captain of the army, admiral of the
navy (May 3, 1747); in October these offices were made hereditary in his
family; in effect monarchy was restored. But the fourth William was too
much of a Christian to be a good general; he was unable to re-establish
discipline in the army; defeat followed defeat; and in the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) Holland was lucky to survive territorially intact
but again economically desolate. William died of erysipelas at forty
(1751); his widow, Princess Anne, served as regent till her death
(1759); Prince Ludwig Ernst of Brunswick-Wolfenbiittel ruled sternly but
ably till William V came of age (1766).</p>
<p>In the war between England and the American colonies Holland pro-
tested British interference with Dutch shipping, and joined Russia in
the “Armed Neutrality” of 1780; England declared war, and captured
nearly all Dutch shipping. In the Treaty of Paris (1783) the interests
of Holland were almost ignored; she surrendered Negapatam (in south
India) to Eng- land, and allowed the English free navigation through the
Moluccas. Hol- land ceased to play a part among the powers.</p>
<p>These disasters destroyed the popularity of William V. Moreover, the
success of the revolt in America stimulated democratic ideas in the
Nether- lands, and led to the rise of a party of “Patriots” hostile to
the ruling family. Through every change of government the moneyed
minority had so ab- sorbed the declining wealth of the nation that many
men turned to begging, and many women to prostitution, in once
flourishing and orderly towns. In 1783 companies o f “free shooters”
were secretly formed in Amsterdam and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM</p>
<p>649</p>
<p>The Hague to prepare revolution. In 1787 the Patriots seized power,
but William V was restored by armed intervention from Prussia. The
French Revolution revived the ardor of the Patriots; they invited France
to come to their aid. In 1794 French troops invaded Holland; the Dutch
army was overwhelmed; William V fled to England; and the Dutch
revolutionists joined with the French in organizing the Batavian
Republic (1795-1806). In 1815 the son of William V restored the house of
Orange-Nassau to power as King William I. His descendants reign in the
Netherlands today (1967). III. THE DANES: 1715-97</p>
<p>The first official census of Denmark (1769) reckoned its population
at 825,000 souls, with another 727,600 in Norway, which remained till
1814 under the Danish kings. Nearly all the peasants in Norway owned
their lands, and were as proud as Vikings. In Denmark half the peasantry
were serfs, and the other half were subject to feudal dues. The kings
labored to check this feudalism, but they were financially dependent
upon the mag- nates, and serfdom continued till 1787. In this regime
little encouragement was given to commerce or industry; no significant
middle class developed; and the opening of the Kiel Canal (1783)
benefited English and Dutch traders rather than the Danes. In 1792
Denmark was the first European power to abolish the slave trade in its
dominions.</p>
<p>As the nobles ruled the state, so the Lutheran Church ruled the
pulpit, the press, and, hopefully, the mind. A severe censorship,
maintained from 1537 to 1849, outlawed all print or speech not in accord
with Lutheran ortho- doxy, and many no ntheological books, like Goethe’s
Wert her, were pro - scribed as imperiling public morality. The
development of literature was further hampered by the use of German at
court, Latin at the universities, and French in belles-lettres — of
which there was almost none. To have in- augurated Danish literature by
writing in the vernacular, and to have brought some rays of the
Enlightenment into Denmark, were among the accomplishments of the most
brilliant Dane of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Norway as well as Denmark can claim Ludvig von Holberg, for he was
born in Bergen (December 3, 1684). After studying at the local Latin
school, he crossed the water to enter the University of Copenhagen. Soon
his funds ran short; he returned to Norway and served as tutor in the
family of a country parson. Having saved sixty thalers, he set out to
see the world. In 1704 he was in Holland; in 1706-8 he was educating
himself in the libra- ries of Oxford. Back in Copenhagen, he gave
lectures which brought him little more than self-instruction; meanwhile
he lived by tutoring, and fed on ambition. In 1714 the university
appointed him to a professorship, without pay, but a private gift
enabled him to wander through Italy and France for two years, mostly on
foot. Returning from this grandest of grand tours, he was made professor
of metaphysics, which he hated, then of Latin and rhetoric, at last ( 1
7 30) of history and geography, which he loved.</p>
<p>In his leisure moments he created Danish literature. Till his time
there had</p>
<p>650</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>been, in Danish, hardly anything but ballads, farces, hymns, and
works of popular piety. Holberg produced a small library of poems,
satires, novels, and treatises in Danish on politics, law, history,
science, and philosophy. Only Voltaire rivaled him in versatility. Like
Voltaire he used laughter as a scourge of pompous professors worshiping
the classics, lawyers hobbling justice with technicalities, clergymen
scrambling for money and place, phy- sicians easing patients into
eternity. Nearly all these pillars of society were pilloried in his
first major work, a mock epic, Peder Paars (1719). Some great Danes felt
the sting, and urged King Frederick IV to suppress the book as offensive
to morals and making fun of priests; the King had the first canto read
to him, and judged it “a harmless, amusing work”; but the royal council
informed Holberg that it would have been better if the poem had never
been written. 26</p>
<p>So he turned to the stage. In 1720 a French actor, Etienne Capion,
opened in Copenhagen the first Danish theater. Finding no Danish plays
meriting production, he imported dramas from France and Germany. He saw
from Peder Paars that Holberg had the materials and talent for comedy;
he ap- pealed to him to provide the new theater with vernacular plays;
within a year Holberg composed five, within eight years twenty, and all
so rich in pictures of local mores that his great successor, Adam
Oehlenschlager, said of him: “He knew how to paint the bourgeois life of
his Copenhagen so faithfully that if this city were to be swallowed up,
and if after two hundred years the comedies of Holberg were
rediscovered, one would be able to re- construct the epoch from them,
just as from Pompeii and Herculaneum we know the times of ancient Rome.”
27</p>
<p>Holberg took forms and ideas from Plautus, Terence, Moliere, and the
Commedia dell’ Arte, which he had seen in Italy. Some of his comedies

<p>He had shocked his university confreres by writing for the stage; now
he mollified them with historical works presenting to Danish readers the
results of West-European scholarship. A Description of Denmark and
Norway (1729), A History of Denmark (1732-3 5), a Universal Church
History (1727-47), and A History of the Jews were compilations, but they
were well done. From these labors Holberg sought relief in his
masterpiece — Nico- lai Klirmi Iter subterraneum (1741). He wrote it in
Latin prose to reach a European audience; it did, but through
translations: Jens Baggesen turned</p>

<p>651</p>
<p>it into Danish, in which it ran through three editions; in German it
had ten, in Swedish, Dutch, and English, three, in French and Russian
two, in Hun- garian one. It was this Subterranean Journey of Niels Klim
that made Hol- berg the Swift as well as the Voltaire of Denmark.</p>
<p>The noises from a cave rouse Niels’s curiosity; he re solves to
investigate; his friends lower him by a rope, which breaks; “with
amazing velocity I was hurried down into the abyss.” 30 Within the crust
of the earth he finds an open space or firmament, containing a sun, its
planets, and many stars. Falling toward one of these planets, he becomes
its satellite, and revolves around it helplessly; but he catches hold of
an eagle and is carried with it to make a soft landing on the planet
Potu (“Utopfia]” reversed). Here the trees are the ruling species, ri ch
in sapient sap; unfortunately “that very tree which I climbed upon… was
the wife of the sheriff.” 31 Potu has some ex - cellent laws. People who
“dispute publicly about the qualities and essence of the Supreme Being
are looked upon as slightly in sane”; they are treated by bloodletting
to reduce their fever, and then are kept in confinement until they
“emerge from this delirium.” 32 Mothers in Potu nurse their infants—
twenty- one years before Rousseau’s appeal to maternal breasts. In the
prov - ince of Cocklecu (Cuckoldy) the women govern the state, the men
keep house or become prostitutes, the Queen has a harem of three hundred
hand- some youths. The philosophers in Cocklecu spend their time trying
to get to the sun, and pay little attention to earthly affairs. In the
province of Mi- kolac all the people are atheists, and “do whatever evil
they can conceal from the police.” 33 Niels comes upon a book entitled T
avian’s Journey to the Superterranean World, which describes Europe and
its strange customs: heads covered with enormous wigs, hats worn under
the arm (as among the nobles of France), “little cakes or wafers that
are carried about the streets,</p>
<p>The Iter subterraneum contained some satires of Christian dogma, and
called for freedom of worship for all sects; but it recommended belief
in God, heaven, and hell as necessary supports for a moral code
continually battered by the demands of the ego and the flesh. 35 King
Frederick V made the reformed reformer a baron in 1747; Holberg had the
pleasure -of rebel- lion in his youth and of acceptance in old age,
which ended in 1754. He re- mains to this day the dominating figure in
the literature of Denmark.</p>
<p>Some would give that place rather to Johannes Ewald, whose career
matched those of Byron, Keats, and Shelley in adventure, suffering, and
brevity. Born in Copenhagen in 1743, son of a Lutheran minister, he
rebelled against his puritanic elders, fell in love at sixteen with
Arense Hulegaard, abandoned a theological career as too tardy in its
rewards, enlisted in the Prussian and then the Austrian army, resolved
to win the wealth and glory that would make Arense his bride. But
privations and disease destroyed his health; he returned to Copenhagen
and theology; Arense married a promp- ter fortune, and Ewald poured out
his heart in poetry and prose. He wrote the first original Danish
tragedy, Rolf Krage (1770), and reached the zenith</p>
<p>6 5 z</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>of Danish poetry in the eighteenth century with Balder’ s Death
(1773), an heroic drama in verse. His work brought him hardly enough
bread to live on; he retired to rural solitude, nursed a succession of
ailments, and was at last revived by a pension from the government. He
rewarded it with a play, The Fishers (1779), containi ng the patriotic
ballad “King Christian Stood by the Lofty Mast,” which became the
favorite national song of the DanesJ 6 It was Ewald’s call to glory and
his farewell to life; he died after a long and painful illness in 1781,
aged thirty-eight. Scandin avians rank him as “one of the greatest lyric
poets of the North, perhaps the very greatest.” 37</p>
<p>As the eighteenth century progressed, the political history of
Denmark became part of the unending modern drama between tradition and
experi- ment. Christian VI (r. 1730-46) mingled the opposed forces. He
and his ministers advanced economic development by importing weavers and
spin- ners to establish a textile industry, by forming national
companies to trade with Asia and America, and by opening the Bank of
Copenhagen (1736). They brought Greenland under the Danish crown (1744).
They spread primary and secondary schools, and founded academies for the
promotion of letters and learning. However, they renewed an old
ordinance requiring Sun- day attendance at Lutheran services; they
closed all theaters and dance halls, banished actors, forbade
masquerades.</p>
<p>Christian’s son Frederick V (r. 1746 -66) allowed these laws to
stand, but softened them by his genial spirit and sensual life. In 1751
he secured from Hanover Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff, who, as
chief minister, raised the honesty and competence of administration,
restored the army and navy, kept them out of the Seven Years’ War, and
stirred the still waters of Danish culture by importing professors,
poets, artists, and scientists; we have seen Klopstock accepting such an
invitation. In 1767 Count von Bern- storff crowned his pacific foreign
policy by persuading Catherine the Great to sign an agreement releasing
Holstein-Gottorp to Denmark.</p>
<p>Frederick V, worn out with pleasure, died at forty-three (1766).
His</p>
<p>son Christian VII (r. 1766-1808) was hurried into marriage at the age
of seventeen with Caroline Matilda, sister of England’s George III; she
bright - ened the social life of the capital, but her half-insane
husband neglected her for a life of profligacy, and Caroline slipped
into a tragic amour with the court physician, Johann Friedrich
Struensee. Son of a theology professor at Halle, Struensee studied
medicine there, and, like most physicians, lost his religious faith. He
owed his influence with the King to his skill in treating the clinical
results of royal amours, and with the Queen to his success in bringing
Christian VII sufficiently to her bed to beget an h eir. As the King’s
mind sank into apathetic gloom, the Queen’s power in the government
grew; and as she allowed her physician to direct her policies as well as
to enjoy her favors, he became (1770) the real ruler of the state.
Orders went out from the royal palace signed by Struensee in the name of
the non-compos- mentis King. Bernstorff was dismissed, and retired
peacefully to his estates in Germany.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM 653</p>
<p>Struensee had read the philosophes , and on their principles he
proposed to remodel Danish life. He abolished the abuses of noble
privilege, ended censorship of the press, established schools, cleansed
the civil service of cor- ruption and jobbery, emancipated the serfs,
forbade judicial torture, pro- claimed toleration for all religions,
encouraged literature and art, reformed the law and the courts, the
police, the university, the finances, municipal sanitation… To reduce
the public debt he canceled many pensions, and appropriated the revenues
of pious foundations to public ends.</p>
<p>The nobles plotted his fall, and used the freedom of the press to sap
his popularity. Pious Danes resented religious toleration as atheism,
and spoke of Struensee as a foreigner whose sole source of authority was
the bed of the Queen. On January 17, 1772, a group of army officers
persuaded the King that Struensee and the Queen were planning to kill
him. He signed an order for their arrest. Caroline was deported to
Hamlet’s Castle of Kron - borg; Struensee was cast into a dungeon, and,
after five weeks of suffering, confessed adultery with the Queen. On
April 28, 1772, he was hacked to pieces on a scaffold in the presence of
an approving multitude. Caroline, on the insistence of George III, was
allowed to retire to Celle in Hanover, where she died on May 10, 1775,
aged twenty-four.</p>
<p>The successful conspirators raised to power Ove Guldberg, tutor
of</p>
<p>Prince Frederick. During twelve years of rule Guldberg led a
patriotic re- action against foreign influence in government, language,
and education, opened office to commoners, restored serfdom, judicial
torture, the suprem- acy of the Lutheran Church, and the religious
orientation of the university. Count von Bernstorff’s neph ew and
protege Andreas Peter von Bernstorff was put in charge of foreign
affairs. When Prince Frederick made himself regent (1784) Guldberg was
dismissed; Andreas von Bernstorff became chief minister, and remained so
till his death. Under his prudent guidance serfdom was again abolished
(1787), the slave trade was ended in Danish dominions, economic
enterprise was freed. When Bernstorff died (1797) Denmark had been set
firmly on the road to that peaceful prosperity which made her the envy
of the world.</p>

<li>Politics: 1 7 18-71</li>
</ol>
<p>The dramatic career of Charles XII had been a tragedy for Sweden. His
aims had consulted his thirst for glory rather than the resources of his
coun- try. The Swedish people had borne with him valiantly while he
exhausted their manpower and their wealth, but they had known, long
before he died, that he was doomed to fail. By the Treaties of Stockholm
(1719-20) Sweden yielded the duchies of Bremen and Verden to Hanover,
and the larger part of Pomerania to Prussia. By the Peace of Nystad
(1721) she surrendered Livonia, Esthonia, Ingermanland, and east Karelia
to Russia. Sweden’s power</p>
<p>654 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XXVI</p>
<p>on the mainland was ended, and she was compelled to withdraw into a
pen- insula rich in minerals and national character, but demanding
arduous labor and persistent skill as the price of life.</p>
<p>The defeat of Charles weakened the monarchy, and allowed the nobles
to regain control of the government. The constitution of 1720 gave domi-
nant power to a Riksdag, or Diet, made up of four “estates”: a
Riddarhus, or House of Nobles, composed of the heads of all noble
families; a House of Priests — the bishops plus some fifty delegates
elected by and from the parish clergy; a House of Burgesses — some
ninety delegates representing the admin- istrative officials and
business leaders of the towns; and a House of Peasants — approximately a
hundred delegates chosen by and from the free landown- ing farmers. Each
estate sat separately, and no measure could become law unless three
estates approved; in effect the peasant estate had no legislative power
except by consent of two other estates. During the meetings of the
Riksdag a “Secret Committee” of fifty nobles, twenty -five priests, and
twenty-five burgesses prepared all bills, chose the ministers, and
controlled foreign policy. The nobles were free from taxation, and had
exclusive right to the higher offices in the state. 38 When the Riksdag
was not in session the government was led by a Rad (Council) of sixteen
or twenty-four men chosen by the Riksdag and responsible to it. The king
presided over this Council and could cast two votes; otherwise he had no
lawmaking power. Russia, Prussia, and Denmark collaborated to support
this constitution, on the ground that it favored a policy of peace and
checked the martial pro- pensities of strong kings.</p>
<p>The monarchy ceased to be hereditary, became elective. At the death
of Charles XII (November 30, 1718) the throne would have passed by
hered- ity to Karl Friedrich, duke of Holstein- Gottorp, a son of
Charles’s eldest sister; but the Riksdag, assembling in January, 1719,
for the first time in twenty years, gave the crown to Ulrika Eleanora,
another sister of Charles, on her agreement to renounce the royal
absolutism that her brother had ex- ercised. Even so, she proved hard to
manage, and in 1720 she was persuaded to abdicate in favor of her
husband, Landgrave Frederick I of Hesse-Cassel, who now became King
Frederick I of Sweden. Under the prudent guidance of Count Arvid
Bernhard Horn as chancellor, Sweden was allowed eighteen years of peace
in which to recover from the wounds of war.</p>
<p>Proud Swedes ridiculed his pacifism, and called his partisans
“Nightcaps” —“Caps” for short— implying that they were dotards sleeping
while Sweden fell behind in the parade of the powers. Against these a
party of “Hats” was formed by Count Carl Gyllenborg, Karl Tessin, and
others; this captured the Riksdag in 1738, and Gyllenborg replaced Horn.
Resolved to restore Sweden to her former place among the powers, he
renewed the lapsed alli- ance with France, which sent her subsidies in
return for opposition to the aims of Russia; and in 1741 the government
declared war against Russia, hoping to regain those Baltic provinces
which had been lost to Peter the Great. But neither the army nor the
navy had been sufficiently prepared; the navy was incapacitated by
disease, and the army yielded all Finland to the Russian advance.
Czarina Elizabeth, anxious to win Sweden’s support,</p>

<p>FROM GENEVA T O STOCKHOLM</p>
<p>655</p>
<p>agreed to restore most of Finland if her cousin, Adolphus Frederick
of Hol- stein-Gottorp, was named heir to the Swedish throne. On these
terms the Peace of Abo ended the war (1743). When Frederick I died
(1751) Ad- olphus Frederick became king.</p>
<p>The estates soon taught him that he was king in name only. They
disputed his right to name new peers, or to choose the members of his
household; they threatened to dispense with his signature if he objected
to signing certain measures or documents. The King was docile, but he
had a proud and com- manding consort, Louisa Ulrika, sister of Frederick
the Great. King and Queen attempted a revolt against the power of the
estates. It failed; its agents were tortured and beheaded; the King was
spared because the people loved him. Louisa Ulrika consoled and
distinguished herself by becoming Queen of Letters: she befriended
Linnaeus, and gathered about her a circle of poets and artists through
whom she spread the ideas of the French Enlightenment. The Riksdag
appointed a new tutor for her ten-year-old son, with instruc- tions to
inform the future Gustavus III that in free states kings exist only on
sufferance; that they are invested with splendor and dignity “more for
the honor of the realm than for the sake of the person who may happen to
oc- cupy the chief place in t he pageant,” and that “as the glare and
glitter of a court” might mislead them into delusions of grandeur, they
would do well to visit the huts of the peasantry now and then, and see
the poverty that pays for the royal pomp. 39</p>
<p>On February 12, 1771, Adolphus Frederick died, and the Council sum-
moned Gustavus III to come from Paris and accept the forms of
royalty.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Gustavus III</li>
</ol>
<p>He was the most attractive king since Henry IV of France. Handsome
and gay, loving women, the arts, and power, he flashed through Swedish
history like an electric charge, bringing to action all the vital
elements in the nation’s life. He had been well educated by Karl Tessin,
and had been spoiled by his fond mother. He was intellectually
precocious and keen, well endowed with imagination and aesthetic sense,
restless with ambition and pride; it is not easy to be a humble prince.
His mother transmitted to him her love of French literature; he read
Voltaire avidly, sent him homage, learned the Henriade by heart. The
Swedish ambassador at Paris forwarded to him each volume of the
Encyclopedic as it appeared. He studied history with attention and
fascination; he was thrilled by the careers of Gustavus Vasa, Gustavus
Adolphus, Charles XII; after reading of these men he could not bear to
be a do-nothing king. In 1766, without consulting him, and with- out the
consent of his parents, the Council married him to Princess Sophia
Magdalena, daughter of Denmark’s Frederick V. She was shy, gentle,
pious, and thought the theater a place of sin; he was skeptical, loved
the drama, and never forgave the Council for projecting him into this
uncongenial marriage. The Council appeased him for a time by a handsome
grant for a trip to France (1770-71).</p>
<p>He stopped at Copenhagen, Hamburg, and Brunswick, but Paris was

<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>goal. He braved the anger of Louis XV by calling upon the banished
Choi- seul, and he violated the conventions by visiting Mme. du Barry in
her chateau at Louveciennes. He met Rousseau, d’Alembert, Marmontel, and
Grimm, but was disillusioned; “I have made the acquaintance of all the
philosophers,” he wrote to his mother, “and find their books much more
agreeable than their persons.” 40 He s hone as a northern star at the
salons of Mmes. Geoffrin, du Deffand, de Lespinasse, d’Epinay, and
Necker. Amid his triumphs he received word that he had become king of
Sweden. He did not hurry back; he stayed in Paris long enough to secure
large subsidies for Sweden from the almost bankrupt government of
France, and 300,000 livres for his own use in managing the Riksdag. On
his way home he stopped to see Frederick the Great, who warned him that
Prussia would defend — if necessary by arms — that Swedish constitution
which so strictly limited the powers of the king.</p>
<p>Gustavus reached Stockholm on June 6. On the fourteenth he opened his
first Riksdag with amiable words strangely like those with which another
hampered king , George III, had opened his first Parliament in 1760.
“Born and bred among you, I have learned from my tenderest youth to love
my country, and I hold it the highest privilege to have been born a
Swede, and the greatest honor to be the first citizen of a free people.”
41 His eloquence and patriotism won a warm response from the nation, but
it left the politi- cians unmoved. The Caps, friends of the constitution
and Russia, and financed by forty thousand pounds from Catherine II, won
a majority in three of the four estates. Gustavus countered by borrowing
200,000 pounds from Dutch bankers to buy the election of his nominee as
marshal of the Riksdag. But he had still to be crowned, and the
Cap-controlled estates re- vised the coronation oath to pledg e the king
to abide by the decision of “a majority of the estates,” and to base all
preferments on merit alone. Gustavus resisted for half a year this move
toward democracy; then (March, 1772) he signed it. Secretly he resolved
to overthrow this ungracious constitution as soon as opportunity
came.</p>
<p>He prepared his ground by establishing popularity. He made himself
ac- cessible to all; he “bestowed favors as if receiving them”; he sent
no one away discontent. Several army leaders agreed with him that only a
strong central government, untrammeled by a venal Riksdag, could save
Sweden from domination by Russia and Prussia — which at this very time
(August 5,</p>
<ol start="1772" type="1">
<li>were partitioning Poland. Vergennes, the French ambassador, con-
tributed 500,000 ducats to the expenses of the coup. On August 18
Gustavus arranged that army officers should meet him at the arsenal the
next morning. Two hundred came; he asked them to join him in
overthrowing a regime of corruption and instability fo stered by
Sweden’s enemies; all but one agreed to follow him. The exception,
Governor-General Rudbeck, rode through the streets of Stockholm calling
upon the people to protect their freedom; they remained apathetic, for
they admired Gustavus, and had no love for a Riksdag that, in their
view, covered an oligarchy of nobles and businessmen with democratic
forms. The young King (now twenty-six)</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. XXVI )</p>
<p>FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM</p>
<p>657</p>
<p>led the officers to the barracks of the Stockholm Guards; to these he
spoke so persuasively that they pledged him their support. He seemed to
be re- peating, step by step, the procedure by which Catherine II had
reached power in Russia ten years before.</p>
<p>When the Riksdag met on August 2 1 it found its Rikssaal surrounded
by grenadiers, and the hall itself held by troops. Gustavus, in a speech
that made history, reproved the estates for having debased themselves
with party quarrels and foreign bribery, and he ordered read to them the
new constitu- tion that his aides had prepared. It retained a limited
monarchy, but widened the powers of the king; it gave him control of the
army, navy, and foreign relations; he alone could appoint and depose
ministers; the Riksdag was to assemble only at his call, and he could
dismiss it at will; it could discuss only such measures as he laid
before it, but no measure could become law without the Riksdag’s
consent, and it would retain control of the purse through the Bank of
Sweden and the right to tax. The king was not to engage in a war of
offense without the Riksdag’s concurrence. Judges were to be named by
the king and be then irremovable; and the right of habeas corpus would
pro- tect all arrested persons from the delays of the law. Gustavus
asked the dele- gates to accept this constitution; the bayonets
convinced them; they ac- cepted, and swore loyalty. The King thanked the
Riksdag and dismissed it, promising to recall it within six years. The
Hats and Caps parties disappeared. The coup d’etat was effected with
bloodless expedition, and apparently to the satisfaction of the people;
they “hailed Gustavus as their liberator, and loaded him with
blessings;… men embraced one another with tears of joy.” 42 France
rejoiced, Russia and Prussia threa tened war to restore the old
constitution. Gustavus stood his ground; Catherine and Frederick
retreated, lest war should endanger their Polish spoils.</p>
<p>In the ensuing decade Gustavus behaved as a constitutional monarch —
i.e., subject to constituted law. He carried out beneficent reforms, and
earned a place among the “enlightened despots” of the century. Voltaire
hailed him as “the worthy heir of the great name of Gustavus.” 43
Turgot, frustrated in France, had the satisfaction of seeing his
economic policies succeed in Swe- den, where free trade was legalized in
grains, and industry was released from the cramping regulations of the
guilds. Commerce was stimulated by the organization of free ports on the
Baltic and free market towns in the interior. Mirabeau pere was asked
for advice on improving agriculture; Lemercier de la Riviere was
commissioned to draw up a plan for public education. 44 Gustavus sent to
Voltaire a copy of the ordinance guaranteeing freedom of the press
(1774), and wrote: “It is you that humanity has to thank for the
destruction of those obstacles which ignorance and fanaticism have
opposed to its progress.” 45 He reformed the law and the judiciar y,
abolished torture, reduced penalties, and stabilized the currency. He
lowered the taxes of the peasantry. He reorganized the army and the
fleet. Ending the Lutheran monopoly on Swedish piety, he granted
toleration to all Christian sects and, in three major cities, to Jews.
When he summoned the Riksdag in 1778, his first six years of rule were
approved by it without a single dissenting voice.</p>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Swedish Enlightenment</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid this activity of legislation and administration, the King
contributed with all his heart to the magnificent outburst of literature
and science that put Sweden fully abreast of European intellectual
developments in the eighteenth century. This was the age of Linnaeus in
botany, of Scheele and Bergman in chemistry; we have elsewhere paid them
honor. But perhaps we should have included under science one of the most
remarkable Swedes of the age, Emanuel Swedenborg, for it was as a
scientist that he first earned fame. He did original work in physics,
astronomy, geology, paleontology, mineralogy, physiology, and
psychology. He improved the air pump by using mercury; he gave good
accounts of magnetism and phosphorescence; he proposed a nebular
hypothesis long before Kant and Laplace; he antici- pated modem research
on the ductless glands. He showed, 150 years before any other scientist,
that the motion of the brain is synchronous with the respiration rather
than with the pulse. He localized in the cortex of the brain the higher
operations of the mind, and assigned to specific parts of the brain the
control of specific parts of the body. 47 He addressed the House of
Nobles on the decimal system, the reform of the currency, the balance of
trade. All his genius seemed directed to science. But when he concluded
that his studies were leading him to a mechanistic theory of mind and
life, and that this theory led to atheism, he reacted strongly away from
science toward religion. In 1745 he began to have visions of heaven and
hell; he came to trust these visions literally, and he described them in
his treatise Heaven and Its Wonders and Hell. He informed his thousands
of readers that in heaven they would not be disembodied spirits but real
flesh-and- blood men and women, enjoying the physical as well as the
spiritual delights of love. He did not preach, nor did he found a sect;
but his influence spread throughout Europe, affecting Wesley, William
Blake, Coleridge, Carlyle, Emerson, and Browning; and finally (1788) his
followers formed the “New Jerusalem Church.”</p>
<p>Despite his opposition Sweden gave its mind more and more to the En-
lightenment. The import or translation of French and English works
rapidly produced a secularization of culture and a refinement of
literary taste and forms. Under Gustavus III and his mother the new
liberalism found wide acceptance in the middle and upper classes, even
among the higher clergy, who began to preach toleration and a simple
deistic creed. 48 Everywhere the watchwords were reason, progress,
science, liberty, and the good life here on earth. Linnaeus and others
organized the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences in 1739; Karl Tessin
founded the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in</p>

<p>CHAP. XXVI ) FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM 659</p>
<p>and directed it to award yearly a medal worth twenty ducats for the
best Swedish work in history, poetry, or philosophy; he himself won the
first award with his panegyric of Lennart Torstenson, the most brilliant
of Gustavus Adolphus’ generals. In 1786 the King established (to use his
own words) “a new academy for the cultivation of our own langua ge, on
the model of the Academie Frangaise. It is to be called the Swedish
Academy, and will consist of eighteen members.” This and the Academy of
Belles - Lettres were provided with funds for pensions to Swedish
scholars and authors. 49 Gustavus personally helped men of letters, of
science, or of music; he made them feel that his bounty was their due;
he gave them new social status by inviting them to his court; and he
stimulated them by his competi- tion.</p>
<p>There had been drama in Sweden before him, especially under
encourage- ment by his mother, but it had been provided by French actors
presenting French plays. Gustavus dismissed the alien troupe, and called
upon native talent to produce plays for a really Swedish theater. He
himself collaborated with Johan Willander in writing an opera, Thetis
och Felee this had its premiere on January 18, 1773, and ran for
twenty-eight nights. Then for eight years the King gave himself to
politics. In 1781 he took up the pen again, and composed a series of
plays which still rank high in Swedish literature. The first of them,
Gustaf Adolfs Adelmod ( Gustavus Adolphus’ Magnanimity , 1782) marked
the beginning of the Swedish drama. The King took his subjects from
historical records, and taught his people the history of their country
as Shakespeare had taught the English. In 1782, at state ex- pense, a
superb theater was built for both drama and music. Gustavus wrote his
plays in prose, had them versified by Johan Kellgren, and had native or
foreign composers put them to music; so his plays became operas. The
best results of this collaboration were Gustaf Adolf och Ebha Brahe ,
celebrating the great commander’s love story, and Gustaf Vasa , which
told how the first Gustavus had freed Sweden from Danish domination.</p>
<p>With such royal leadership, and three universities (Uppsala, Abo, and
Lund), Sweden moved into its own Enlightenment. Olof von Dalin provided
an Addisonian prelude by writing anonymously, and periodically publish-
ing (1733-34), Den svenska Argus , discussing everything except
politics, in the genial style of the Spectator. Nearly every reader was
pleased. The Riksdag voted a reward to the author, who forthwith came
out of hiding. Queen Louisa Ulrika made him court poet and tutor to the
future Gustavus III. This fettered and dulled his Muse, but it allowed
him time and money to write his chef- d’oeuvre, Svea Rikes Historia ,
the first critical history of the Swedish realm.</p>
<p>The most interesting figure in the new Pleiade was a woman, Hedvig
Nordenflycht, the Sappho, Aspasia, and Charlotte Bronte of Sweden. She
alarmed her puritan parents by reading plays and poetry; they punished
her, she persisted, and wrote verses so charming that they resigned
themselves to the scandal. But they compelled her to marry the overseer
of their estate, who was wise and ugly; “I loved to listen to him as a
philosopher, but the</p>
<p>66 o</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>sight of him as a lover was unendurable.” 50 She learned to love him,
only to have him die in her arms after three years of marriage. A
handsome young clergyman ended her mourning by courting her; she became
his wife, and enjoyed “the most blissful life that any mortal can have
in this imperfect world”; but he died within a year, and Hedvig went
almost insane with grief. She isolated herself in a cottage on a small
island, and voiced her sor- row in poems that were so well received that
she moved to Stockholm and issued annually (1744-50) Aphorisms for
Women, by a Shepherdess of the North. Her home became a salon for the
social and intellectual elite. Young poets like Fredrik Gyllenborg and
Gustaf Creutz followed her in adopting the classic French style and in
espousing the Enlightenment. In 1758, aged forty, she fell in love with
Johan Fischerstrom, twenty-three; he confessed that he loved another,
but when he saw Hedvig desolate he proposed mar- riage to her. She
refused the sacrifice, and to simplify matters she tried to drown
herself. She was rescued, but she died three days later. Shepherdess of
the North is still a classic in the literature of Sweden.</p>
<p>Creutz followed her romantic flight with an exquisite cycle of songs,
A tis och Camilla (1762), which remained for many years the most admired
poem in the language. Camilla, as a priestess of Diana, is vowed to
chastity; Atis, a hunter, sees her, longs for her, wanders through the
woods in despair. Camilla too is stirred, and asks Diana, “Is not
nature’s law as holy as your decree ?” She comes upon a wounded hart;
she tends and comforts it; it licks her hand; Atis begs similar
privileges; she rebukes him; he jumps from a high cliff, seeking death;
Cupid breaks his fall; Camilla tends him and ac- cepts his embrace; a
serpent buries its fang in her alabaster breast; she dies in Atis’ arms.
Atis sucks the poison from her wound, and nears death. Diana relents,
revives them both, and releases Camilla from her virgin vows; all is
well. This idyl was acclaimed by literate Sweden and by Voltaire, but
Creutz turned to politics and became chancellor of Sweden.</p>
<p>If Hedvig Nordenflycht was the Sappho of Sweden, Karl Bellmann was
its Robert Burns. Brought up in comfort and piety, he learned to prefer
the jolly songs of the taverns to the somber hymns of his home. In the
taverns the realities of life and feeling were revealed with little
concern for conven- tion and propriety; there each soul was bared by
liquor, and let truth come out between fancy and wrath. The most tragic
figure in this human wreck- age was Jan Fredman, once clockmaker to the
court, now trying to, forget in drink the failure of his marriage; and
the gayest was Maria Kiellstrom, queen of the lower depths. Bellmann
sang their songs with them, composed songs about them, sang these before
them to music composed by himself. Some of his songs were a bit loose,
and Kellgren, the uncrowned poet laureate of the age, reproved him; but
when Bellmann prepared Fredmans Epistlar for the press (1790), Kellgren
chaperoned these verse letters with an enthusiastic preface, and the
volume received an award from the Swedish Royal Academy. Gustavus III
heard Bellmann gladly, called him “the Anac - reon of the North,” and
gave him a sinecure in the government. The assassina- tion of the King
(1792) left the poet without income; he sank into poverty,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM 66 1</p>
<p>was imprisoned for debt, was released by friends. Dying of
consumption at the age of fifty-five, he insisted on a last visit to his
favorite tavern; there he sang till his voice failed him. He died soon
afterward, February n, 1795. Some rank him as “the most original of all
Swedish poets,” and “by all odds the greatest in the circle of poets”
that honored this reign. 51</p>
<p>But the man whom his contemporaries recognized as second only to the
King in the intellectual life of the time was Johan Henrik Kellgren. Son
of a clergyman, he discarded the Christian creed, marched with the
French Enlightenment, and welcomed all the pleasures of life with a
minimum of remorse. His earliest book, Mina Ldjen (My Laughter) was an
extended ode to joy, erotic joys included; Kellgren hailed laughter as
“the one divine, dis - tinguishing mark of humanity,” and invited it to
accompany him to the end of his days. 52 In 1778, aged twenty-seven, he
joined with Karl Peter Lenngren in founding the Stockholmsposten ; for
seventeen years his lively pen made this journal the dominant voice in
Swedish intellectual life; in its pages the French Enlightenment held
full sway, the classic style was hon- ored as the supreme norm of
excellence, German romanticism was laughed out of court, and Kellgren’s
mistresses were exalted in poem s that scandal- ized the conservatives
of the hinterland. The assassination of his beloved King took the heart
out of the poet’s hedonistic philosophy. In 1795 one of his amours ran
out of control and deepened into love. Kellgren began to acknowledge the
rights of romance, idealism, and religion; he retracted his condemnation
of Shakespeare and Goethe, and he thought that, after all, the fear of
God might be the beginning of wisdom. However, when he died (1795), aged
only forty-four, he asked that no bells be tolled for him ; 53 he was,
at the end, again a son of Voltaire.</p>
<p>A charming aspect of his character was his willingness to open the
col- umns of the Posten to opponents of his views. The most vigorous of
them was Thomas Thorild, who declared war on the Enlightenment as the
im- mature idolatry of superficial reason. At the age of twenty-two
Thorild startled Stockholm with Passionerna ( The Passions ), which, he
said, “con - tains the full force of my philosophy and all the splendor
of my imagina- tion — unrhymed, ecstatic, marvelous.” He declared that
“his whole life was consecrated to… revealing nature and reforming the
world.” 54 Around him gathered a group of literary rebels who fed their
fires with Sturm und Drang, ranked Klopstock above Goethe, Shakespeare
above Racine, Rous- seau above Voltaire. Failing to win Gustavus III to
these views, Thorild migrated to England (1788), nourished his soul with
James Thomson, Ed- ward Young, and Samuel Richardson, and joined the
radicals who favored the French Revolution. In 1790 he returned to
Sweden and published po- litical propaganda that stirred the government
to banish him. After two years in Germany he was readmitted into Sweden,
and subsided into a pro- fessorial chair.</p>
<p>There were several other stars in this literary firmament. Carl
Gustaf af Leopold pleased the King with the classic form and courtly
tone of his verse. Bengt Lidner, like Thorild, preferred romance. He was
expelled</p>
<p>662</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>from the University of Lund because of his escapades (1776);
continued his studies and irregularities at Rostock; was put on a ship
bound for the East Indies, escaped from it, returned to Sweden, and
attracted the attention of Gustavus with a volume of poetic fables. He
was appointed secretary to Count Creutz in the embassy at Paris; there
he studied women more than politics, and was sent home, where he died in
poverty at the age of thirty- five (1793). He redeemed his life by three
volumes hot with Byronic fire. — And there was modest Anna Maria
Lenngren, wife of Kellgren’s collabora - tor on the Stockholmsposten. To
that periodical she contributed verse that won her a special
commendation by the Swedish Royal Academy. But she did not let her Muse
interfere with her household chores, and in a poem addressed to an
imaginary daughter she counseled her to avoid politics and society and
content herself with the tasks and joys of the home.</p>
<p>Was there, in Swedish art, any movement answering to the literature
and the drama? Hardly. Karl Gustaf of Tessin decorated in rococo
(c. 1750) the royal palace that his father, Nicodemus Tessin, had built
in 1693-97, and he gathered a rich collection of paintings and statuary,
which is now part of the Stockholm National Museum. Johan Tobias Sergei
carved a Venus and a Drunken Faun in classic style, and commemorated in
marble the robust features of Johan Pasch. The Pasch family included
four painters: Lorenz the Elder, his brother Johan, his sister Ulrica,
and Lorenz the</p>
<p>Younger; each of these painted royalty and nobility. They were a
modest part in the brilliant Enlightenment that graced this reign.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Assassination</li>
</ol>
<p>It was the King himself who brought the bright flowering to a tragic
end. The American Revolution, so powerfully aided by France, seemed to
him a threat to all monarchies; he called the colonists “rebellious
subjects,” and vowed that he would never recognize them as a nation
until the King of England had absolved them from their oath of
allegiance. 55 More and more in his final decade he strengthened the
royal power, surrounded it with cere- mony and etiquette, and replaced
able aides of independent mind with servitors who obeyed his wishes
without hesitation or dissent. He began to restrict the freedom that he
had given to the press. Finding his wife dull, he indulged in
flirtations 56 that shocked public opinion, which expected the kings of
Sweden to give the nation a model of marital affection and fidelity. He
alienated the people by establishing a governmental monopoly in the
distillation of liquor; the peasants, accustomed to distill their own,
evaded the monopoly by a hundred expedients. He spent increasingly on
the army and navy, and was visibly preparing for war with Russia. When
he as- sembled his second Riksdag (May 6, 1786) he found no longer, in
the estates, the approval that the Riksdag of 1778 had given to his
measures; almost all of his proposals were rejected, or were amended to
futility, and he was compelled to surrender the government’s liquor
monopoly. On July 5 he dismissed the Riksdag, and resolved to rule
without its consent.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI )</p>
<p>FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM</p>
<p>663</p>
<p>That consent, by the constitution of 1772, was necessary for any war
but one of defense, and Gustavus was meditating an attack upon Russia.
Why? He knew that Russia and Denmark had signed (August 12, 1774) a
secret treaty for united action against Sweden. He visited Catherine II
at St. Petersburg in 1777, but their mutual pretenses of friendship
deceived neither the hostess nor her guest. As Russian victories against
Turkey mounted, Gustavus feared that if nothing were done to end them
the Em- press would soon direct her immense armies westward in the hope
of sub- jecting Sweden to her will as she had done with Poland. Was
there any way of frustrating that design? Only, the King felt, by aiding
Turkey with a flank attack upon St. Petersburg. The Sultan helped him
decide by offering Sweden a subsidy of a million piasters annually for
the next ten years if she would join in the effort to check Catherine.
Perhaps now Sweden could recover what she had surrendered to Peter the
Great in 1721. In 1785 Gus- tavus began to prepare his army and navy for
war. In 1788 he sent to Russia an ultimatum demanding the restoration of
Karelia and Livonia to Sweden, and of the Crimea to Turkey. On June 24
he embarked for Finland. On July 2, at Helsingfors, he took charge of
his assembled forces, and began to drive toward St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Everything went wrong. The fleet was stopped by a Russian flotilla in
an indecisive battle off the island of Hogland (July 17). In the army
113</p>
<p>officers mutinied, charging that the King had violated his pledge to
make no offensive war without the Riksdag’s consent; they sent an
emissary to Catherine offering to place themselves under her protection
and to co- operate with her in making both Swedish and Russian Finland
an independ- ent state. Meanwhile Denmark dispatched an army to attack
Goteborg, the richest city in Sweden. Gustavus accepted this invasion as
a challenge that would arouse the spirit of his people; he appealed to
the nation, and es- pecially to the rugged peasants of the mining
districts called the Dales, to give him a new and more loyal army; he
went in person, dressed in the Dalesmen’s characteristic garb, to
address them from that same c hurchyard, in the village of Mora, where
Gustavus Vasa had asked for their aid in 1521. The people responded;
volunteer regiments were formed in a hundred towns. In September the
King, fighting for his political life, rode 250 miles in forty-eight
hours, made his way into Goteborg, and inspired the garrison to continue
its defense against twelve thousand besieging Danes. Fortune turned in
his favor. Prussia, unwilling to let Sweden fall subject to Russia,
threatened war upon Denmark; the Danes withdrew from Swedish soil.
Gustavus returned in triumph to his capital.</p>
<p>Now, emboldened by a new army dedicated to him, he summoned the
Riksdag to assemble on January 26, 1789. Of 950 men in the House of
Nobles, seven hundred supported the mutinous officers, but the other
houses — clergy, burgesses, and peasants — were overwhelmingly for the
King. Gustavus declared political war against the nobles by submitting
to the Riksdag an “Act of Unity and Security” which ended many
privileges of the aristocracy, opened nearly all offices to commoners,
and gave the King</p>
<p>664 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>full monarchical powers over legislation, administration, war, and
peace. The three lower estates accepted the act, the Riddarhus rejected
it as un- constitutional. Gustavus arrested twenty-one nobles, including
Count Fred- rik Axel von Fersen and Baron Karl Fredrik von Pechlin — one
honorable and ineffective, the other clever and treacherous. But the
power of the purse still remained with the Riksdag, and appropriations
required the con- sent of all four chambers. The three lower orders
voted the King, for as long as he might consider necessary, the funds he
asked for continuing the war against Russia; the House of Nobles refused
to vote supplies beyond two years. On April 17 Gustavus entered the
Riddarhus, took the chair, and put to the nobles the question of
accepting the decision of the three other houses. The noes
preponderated, but the King announced that his pro- posal had won. He
thanked the nobles for their gracious support, and with- drew, having
risked assassination by the infuriated magnates.</p>
<p>He now felt free to prosecute the war. During the remainder of 1789
he rebuilt the army and the fleet. On July 9, 1790, his navy met the
Russian in the Svensksund part of the Gulf of Finland, and won the most
decisive vic- tory in Sweden’s naval history; the Russians lost fifty
-three ships and 9,500 men. Catherine II, still busy with the Turks, was
ready for peace; by the Treaty of Varala (August 15, 1790) she agreed to
end her efforts to control the politics of Sweden, and prewar boundaries
were restored. On October 19, 1791, Gustavus persuaded her to sign with
him a defensive alliance which pledged her to send Sweden 300,000 rubles
per year.</p>
<p>Doubtless their common fear of the French Revolution turned the old
foes to this new partnership. Gustavus remembered gratefully that France
had been Sweden’s faithful friend through 250 years, and that Louis XV
and Louis XVI had supported him with 38,300,000 Iivres between 1772
and</p>
<ol start="1789" type="1">
<li>He proposed a League of Princes to invade France and restore the
monarchy to power; he sent Hans Axel von Fersen (son of his enemy Count
von Fersen) to arrange the flight of Louis XVI from Paris; he
himself</li>
</ol>
<p>went to Aix-la-Chapelle to lead the allied army; and he offered
asylum in his camp to the French emigres. Catherine gave money but no
men, Leopold II refused to co-operate, and Gustavus returned to
Stockholm to protect his throne.</p>
<p>The nobles whose political supremacy he had ended were not reconciled
to defeat. They looked upon Gustavus’ absolute rule as a plain violation
of the constitution that he had sworn to support. Jakob Ankarstrom
brooded over the fall of his c lass. “I bethought me much if perchance
there was any fair means of getting the King to rule his land and people
according to law and benevolence, but every argument was against me….
’Twere better</p>
<p>On March 16, 1792, a date ominously recalling Caesar, Gustavus
received</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI )</p>
<p>FROM GENEVA TO STOCKHOLM</p>
<p>665</p>
<p>a letter warning him not to attend a masquerade ball scheduled for
that night in the French Theater. He went half masked, but the
decorations on his breast revealed his rank. Ankarstrom recognized him,
shot him, and fled. Gustavus was carried to a coach and led through an
excited crowd to the royal palace. He was bleeding dangerously, but he
jokingly remarked that he resembled a pope borne in procession through
Rome. Within three hours of the attack Ankarstrom was arrested; within a
few days, all the ring- leaders. Horn confessed that the plot had had a
hundred accomplices. The populace cried out for their execution;
Gustavus recommended clemency. Ankarstrom was scourged, beheaded, and
quartered, Gustavus lingered for ten days; then, told that he had only a
few hours of life left to him, he dictated documents for a regency to
govern the country and the capital. He died on March 26, 1792, aged
forty-five. Nearly all the nation mourned him, for it had learned to
love him despite his faults, and it realized that under his lead Sweden
had lived through one of the most glorious ages in her history.</p>
