West</h4>
<p>I. THE kings’ r egister</p>
<p>T he smallest but richest morsel of Alexander’s legacy was allotted
to the ablest and wisest of his generals. With characteristic loyalty
—</p>
<p>perhaps as a visible sanction of his authority — Ptolemy, son of
Lagus, brought the body of the dead king to Memphis, and had it entombed
in a sarcophagus of gold.* He brought with him alio Alexander’s
occasional mistress Thais, married her, and had by her two sons. He was
a plain, blunt soldier, capable both of generous feeling and of
realistic thinking. While other inheritors of Alexander’s realm spent
half their lives in war, and dreamed of undivided sovereignty, Ptolemy
devoted himself to con- solidating his position in an alien country, and
to promoting Egyptian agriculture, commerce, and industry. He built a
great fleet, and made Egypt as secure against naval attack as nature had
made it almost unassail- able by land. He helped Rhodes and the Leagues
to preserve their inde- pendence of Macedon, and so won the title of
Soter. Only when, after eighteen years of labor, he had firmly organized
the political and economic life of his new realm did he call himself
king (305). Through him and his successor Greek Egypt established its
rule over Gyrene, Crete, the Cy- clades, Cyprus, Syria, Palestine,
Phoenicia, Samos, Lesbos, Samothrace, and the Hellespont. In his old age
he found time to write astonishingly truth- ful commentaries on his
campaigns, and to establish, about 290, the Mu- seum and Library that
were to make the fame of Alexandria. In 285, feeling his eighty-two
years, he appointed his second son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, to the throne,
yielded the government to him, and took his place as a subject in the
young king’s court. Two years later he died.</p>
<p>Already the fertile valley and delta had poured great wealth into the
royal treasury. Ptolemy I, to give a dinner to his friends, had had to
bor- row their silver and rugs; Ptolemy II spent ,500,000 on the feast
that climaxed his coronation.’ The new Pharaoh was a convert to the
philoso -</p>

<p>phy of Gyrene, and was resolved to enjoy each monochronos hedone —
every pleasure that the moment gave. He ate himself into obesity, tried
a variety of mistresses, repudiated his wife, and finally married his
sister Arsinoe.* The new queen ruled the Empire and managed its wars
while Ptolemy II reigned among the chefs and scholars of his court.
Following and improving upon the example of his father, he invited to
Alexandria as his guests famous poets, savants, critics, scientists,
philosophers, and artists, and made his capital beautiful with
architecture in the Greek style. Dur- ing his long reign Alexandria
became the literary apd scientific capital of the Mediterranean, and
Alexandrian literature flourished as it would never do again.
Nevertheless Philadelphus was unhappy in his old age; his gout and his
cares increased with the extent of his wealth and his power. Look- ing
out from his palace window he saw and envied a beggar who lay at ease in
the sun on the harbor dunes, and he mourned, “Alas, that I was not bom
one of these!”* Haunted by the fear of death, he sought in the lore of
Egyptian priests the magic elixir of eternal life.’</p>
<p>He had so enlarged and lavishly financed the Museum and Library that
kter history named him as their founder. In 307 Demetrius of Phalerum,
expelled from Athens, had taken refuge in Egypt. Ten years later we find
him at the court of Ptolemy I. It was he, apparently, who suggested to
Ptolemy Soter that the capital and the dynasty might be made illustrious
by establishing a Museum — i.e., a House of the Muses — i.e., of the
arts and sciences — which would rival the universities of Athens.
Inspired, probably, by Aristotle’s industry in collecting and
classifying books, knowledge, ani - mals, plants, and constitutions,
Demetrius appears to have recommended the erection of a group of
buildings capable not only of sheltering a great collection of books,
but also of housing scholars who would devote their lives to research.
The plan appealed to the first two Ptolemies; funds were provided, and
the new university slowly took form near the royal palaces. There was a
general mess hall, where the scholars seem- to have had their meals;
there was an exedra, or lecture hall, a court, a cloister, a garden, an
astronomical observatory, and the great Library. The head of the entire
institution was technically a priest, since it was formally dedicated to
the Muses as actual goddesses. Living in the Museum were four groups of
scholars: astronomers, writers, mathematicians, and physicians. All of
these men were Greeks, and all received a salary from the royal
treasury. Their function was not to teach, but to make researches,
studies, and experi- -nients. In later decades, as students multiplied
about the Museum, its mem- bers undertook to give lectures, but the
Museum remained to the end an</p>

<p>587</p>
<p>Institute for Advanced Studies rather than a university. It was, so
far as we know, the first establishment ever set up by a state for the
promotion of literamre and science. It was the distinctive contribution
of the Ptolemies and Alexandria to the history of civilization.</p>
<p>Ptolemy Philadelphus died in 246, after a long and largely beneficent
reign. Ptolemy III Euergetes (Well-Doer) was another Thothmes III,</p>
<p>intent on conquering the Near East; he took Sardis and Babylon,
marched as far as India, and so effectually disorganized the Seleucid
Empire that it crumbled at the touch of Rome. We shall not follow the
record of his wars, for though ^ere is drama in the details of strife,
there is a dreary eternity in its causes and results; such history
becomes a menial attendance upon the vicissitudes of power, in which
victories and defeats cancel one another into a resounding zero.
Euergetes’ young wife Beren ice gave thanks for his successes by
dedicating a lock of her hair to the gods; the poets celebrated the
story, and the astronomers lauded her to the skies by naming one of the
constellations Coma Berenices — Berenice’s Hair.</p>
<p>Ptolemy IV Philopator so loved his father that he imitated his wars
and his triumphs. But his victory over Antiochus III at Raphia (217)
had</p>
<p>been won with native troops — their first use by any Ptolemy; and the
Egyptians, now armed and conscious of their strength, began from this
time onward to break down the authority of the Greeks on the Nile.
Philopator gave himself to amusement, spent much time on his spacious
pleasure boat, introduced the Bacchanalia into Egypt, and half persuaded
himself that he was descended from Dionysus. In 205 his wife was killed
by his mistress; and shortly afterward Philopator himself passed away.
In the ensuing chaos Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus III of Seleucia
were about to dismember and absorb Egypt when Rome — with which the sec-
ond Ptolemy had made a treaty of friendship — entered upon the scene,
de- feated Philip, sent Antiochus packing, and made Egypt a Roman
protec- torate (205).</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>SOCIALISM UNDER THE PTOLEMIES</li>
</ol>
<p>By far the most interesting aspect of Ptolemaic Egypt is its
extensive experiment in state socialism. Royal ownership of the land had
long been a sacred custom in Egypt; the Pharaoh, as king and god, had
full right to the soil and all that it produced. The fellah was not a
slave, but he could not leave his place without the permission of the
government, and he was required to turn over the larger part of his
crops to the state.’ The Ptole-</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>588</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>mies accepted this system, and extended it by appropriating the great
tracts which, under previous dynasties, had belonged to the Egyptian
nobles or priests. A great bureaucracy of governmental overseers,
supported by armed guards, managed all Egypt as a vast state farm.’
Nearly every peasant</p>
<p>Doubtless this system of socialism had been evolved because the
condi- tions of tillage in Egypt required more co-operation, more unison
of action in time and space, than individual ownership could be expected
to provide. The amount and character of the crops to be sown depended
upon the extent of the annual inundation, and the efficiency of
irrigation and drain- age; these matters naturally made for central
control. Greek engineers in the employ of the government improved the
ancient processes, and ap- plied a more scientific and intensive
agriculture to the land. The ancient shaduf was replaced by the noria, a
large wheel sometimes forty feet in diameter, equipped with buckets
hanging freely on the interior rim; at the top of the revolution each
bucket was tilted by an obstructing bar, and emptied its contents into
an irrigation reservo ir; better still, the “screw of Archimedes” and
the pump of Ctesibius* raised water with a speed un - known before the
Ptolemies.” The centralization of economic manage - ment in the hands of
the government, and the institution of forced labor, made possible great
public works of flood control, road construction, irri- gation, and
building, and prepared the way for the engineering feats of</p>
<p>♦ See Chap. XXVII below.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) EGYPT AND THE WEST 589</p>
<p>Rome. Ptolemy II drained Lake Moeris, and turned its bed into a great
tract of fertile land for distribution among the soldiers. In 285 he
began to restore the canal from the Nile near Heliopolis to the Red Sea
near Suez Pharaoh Necho and Darius I had built and rebuilt this, but
twice the shifting sands had choked it up, as in a century they would do
again.</p>
<p>Industry operated under similar conditions. The government not only
owned the mines, but either worked them itself, or appropriated the
ore.” The Ptolemies opened up valuable gold deposits in Nubia, and had a
stable gold coinage. They controlled the copper mines of Cyprus and
Sinai. They had a monopoly of oil — derived not from the soil but from
plants like linseed, croton, and sesame. The government fixed, each
year, the amount of land to be sown to such plants; it took the whole
produce at its own price; it extracted the oil in state factories
through great beam presses worked by serfs; it sold the oil to retailers
at its own price, and excluded foreign competition by a heavy tariff;
its profit ranged from seventy to three hundred per cent.” Apparently
there were similar governmental sub - sidies in salt, natron (carbonate
of soda used as soap), incense, papyrus, and textiles; there were some
private textile factories, but they had to sell all their product to the
state.” Minor industries were left in private hands; the state merely
licensed and supervised them, bought a large share of their output at
fixed prices, and taxed a good part of the profits into the royal
treasury. Handicrafts were carried on by ancient guilds, whose members
were by tradition bound to their trade, their village, even to their
domi- cile.” Industry was well developed; chariots, furniture, terra
cotta, carpets, cosmetics were produced in abundance; glass blowing and
the weaving of linen were Alexandrian specialties. Invention was more
advanced in Ptole- maic Egypt than in any economy before imperial
Rome’s; the screw chain, the wheel chain, the cam chain, the ratchet
chain, the pulley chain, and the scr ew press were all in use;” and the
chemistry of dyes had progressed to the point of treating cloths with
diverse reagents which brought forth, from immersion in one dye, a
variety of fast colors.” In general the fac - tories of Alexandria were
worked by slaves, whose low cost of mainte- nance enabled the Ptolemies
to undersell in foreign trade the products of Greek handicraft.”</p>
<p>All commerce was controlled and regulated by the government; retail
traders were usually state agents distributing state goo ds.” All
caravan routes and waterways were owned by the state. Ptolemy II
introduced the camel into Egypt, and organized a camel post to the
south; this carried only governmental communications, but these included
nearly all the com-</p>
<p>59° THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>mercial correspondence of the country. The Nile was busy with passen-
ger and freight traffic, apparently under private management subject to
state regulation.” For the Mediterranean trade the Ptolemies built the
largest commercial fleet of the time, with vessels of three hundred tons
burden.” The warehouses of Alexandria invited world trade; its double
harbor was the envy of other cities; its lighthouse was one of the Seven
Wonders.* The fields, factories, and workshops of Egypt supplied a great
surplus, which found markets as far east as China, as far south as
central Africa, as far north as Russia and the British Isles. Egyptian
explorers sailed down to Zanzibar and Somaliland, and told the world
about the Troglodytes who lived along the east African coast on sea
food, ostriches, carrots, and roots.” To break the Arab hold on Indian
trade with the Near East,</p>
<p>Egyptian ships sailed directly from the Nile to India. Under the wise
en- couragement of the Ptolemies Alexandria became the leading port of
re- shipment for Eastern merchandise destined for the markets of the
Medi- terranean.</p>
<p>This flowering of commerce and industry was quickened by excellent
banking conveniences. Payment in kind survived to some degree, as a
legacy from ancient Egypt; and the grain of the royal treasuries was
used as part of the bank reserve; but deposits, withdrawals, and
transfers of grain might be made on paper instead of being physically
performed.” Be - side this modified barter rose a complex money economy.
Banking was a government monopoly, but its operations might be delegated
to private firms.” Bills were paid by drafts on bank balances; banks
lent money at</p>

eight hundred talents (about 82,400,000) It rose in several setbacks to
a height of four hundred feet; it was covered with white marble and
adorned with sculptures in marble and bronze; above the pillared cupola
that contained the light rose a twenty-one-foot statue of Poseidon. The
flame came from the burning of resinous wood, and was made visible,
probably by convex metal mirrors, to a</p>

<p>nomic opportunities, unprecedented facilities for the life of the
mind, and a wealthy court as the source and center of a luxurious social
life. Nor was the king an incalculable despot. Egyptian tradition
combined with Greek law to build up a system of legislation which
borrowed from, and improved upon, the Athenian code in every respect
except freedom. The edicts of the king had full legal force; but the
cities enjoyed considerable self-government, and the Egyp- tian, Greek,
and Jewish population lived each under its own system of law, chose its
own magistrates, and pled before its own courts.““ A Turin papyrus gives
us the record of an Alexandrian lawsuit; the issues are precisely
defined, the evi- dence is carefully presented, precedents are
summarized, and the final judgment is given with judicial impartiality.
Other papyri preserve Alexandrian wills, and reveal the antiquity of
legal forms: “This is the will of Peisias the Lycian, son of X, of sound
mind and deliberate intention.”®</p>
<p>The Ptolemaic was the most efficiently organized government in the
Hellenis- tic world. It took its national form from Egypt and Persia,
its municipal form from Greece, and passed them on to Imperial Rome. The
country was divided into nomes or provinces, each administered by
appointees of the king. Nearly all these officials were Greek. The idea
of Alexander, that Greek and Oriental or. Egyptian should live and
mingle on equal terms, was forgotten as unlucrative; the valley of the
Nile became frankly a conquered land. The Greek overseers brought an
advanced technology and management to the economic life of Egypt, and
enormously expanded the wealth of the nation; but they took the
increase. The state charged high prices for the products which it
controlled, and barred competition with a tariff-wall; hence olive oil
that cost twenty-one drachmas in Delos cost fifty-two in Alexandria.
Everywhere the government took rentals, taxes, customs, and tolls,
sometimes labor and life itself. The peasant paid a fee to the state for
the right to keep cattle, for the fodder that he fed them, and for the
privilege of grazing them on the common pasture land. The private owner
of gardens, vineyards, or orchards paid a sixth — under Ptol- emy II a
half — of his produce to the state.® All persons except soldiers,
priests, and government oflSicials paid a poll tax. There were taxes on
salt, legal docu- ments, and bequests; a five per cent tax on rentals, a
ten per cent tax on sales, a twenty-five per cent levy on all fish
caught in Egyptian waters, a toll on goods passing from village to town,
or along the Nile; there were high export as well as import duties at
all Egyptian ports; there were special taxes to maintain the fleet and
the lighthouse, to keep the municipal physicians and police in good
humor, and to buy a gold crown for every new king;® nothing was
overlooked that could fatten the state. To keep track of all taxable
products, income, and transactions the government maintained a swarm of
scribes, and a vast system of personal and property registration; to
collect the taxes it farmed them out to specialists, supervised their
operations, and held their possessions as security till</p>

<p>he returns were in. The total revenue of the Ptolemies, in money and
kind, was probably the greatest gathered by any government between the
fall of Persia and the ascendancy of Rome.</p>
<p>in. ALEXANDRIA</p>
<p>Most of this wealth came to Alexandria. The nome capitals and a few
other towns were also prosperous, with paved and lighted streets, police
protection, and a good water supply; but nothing quite so “modem” as
Alexandria had ever been seen before. Strabo describes it in the first
cen- tury A.D. as over three miles long and a mile wide; Pliny reckons
the city wall as fifteen miles in length.“ Dinocrates of Rhodes and
Sostratus of Cnidus laid out the city on the rectangular plan, with a
central avenue one hundred feet wide ranning from east to west, crossed
by an equally wide avenue from north to south. Each of these
thoroughfares, and probably some others, was well lighted at night, and
was kept cool during the day by mile after mile of shaded colonnades. Of
the four quarters into which the main arteries divided the city the
westernmost, Rhacotis, was occupied chiefly by Egyptians; the northeast
portion formed the Jewish quarter; the southeast comer, or Bracheum,
contained the royal palace, the Museum, the Library, the tombs of the
Ptolemies, the sarcophagus of Alex- ander (the H6tel des Invalides of
the age), the arsenal, the chief Greek temples, and many spacious parks.
One park had a portico six hundred feet in length; another contained the
royal zoological collection. In the center of the city were the
administrative buildings, the government store- houses, the courthouse,
the main gymnasium, and a thousand shops and bazaars. Outside the gates
were a stadium, a hippodrome or race track, an amphitheater, and a vast
cemetery known as the Necropolis, or City of the Dead.® Along the beach
ran a succession of bathing establishments and resorts. A dike or mole,
called Heptastadium because it was seven stadia long, connected the city
with the island of Pharos, and made two harbors out of one. Behind the
city lay Lake Mareotis, which provided ports and outlets for the trafiic
on the Nile; here the Ptolemies kept their pleasure boats and took their
royal ease.*</p>
<p>The population of Alexandria about 200 b.c. was as varied as in a
mod- em metropolis: from four to five hundred thousand Macedonians,
Greeks,</p>
<p>•Hardly anything but a few catacombs and pillars have been preserved
from ancient Alexandria. Its remains lie directly under the present
capital, making excavation expensive; probably they have sunk beneath
the water level; and parts of the old city have been covered oy the
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) EGYPT AND THE WEST 593</p>
<p>Egyptians, Jews, Persians, Anatolians, Syrians, Arabs, and negroes.*”
The growth of commerce had swelled the lower middle class, and filled
the cosmopolitan capital with a busy, talkative, litigious crowd of
shopkeepers and traders, always on the alert for a bargain, and with no
prejudice in favor of honesty. At the top were the Macedonians and the
Greeks, liv- ing in such luxury as astonished the Roman ambassadors who
were ap- pointed to the court in 273. Athenaeus recounts the delicacies
that bur- dened the tables and digestions of the master class,” and
Herodas writes: “Alexandria is the house of Aphrodite, and everything is
to be found there — wealth, playgrounds, a large army, a serene sky,
public displays, philosophers, precious metals, fine young men, a good
royal house, an academy of science, exquisite wines, and beautiful
women.”” Alexandria’s poets were discovering the literary value of
virginity, and its novelists would soon make it the theme and final
casualty of many a tale; but the city was notorious for the generosity
of its women and the number of its stepdaughters of joy; Polybius
complained that the finest private homes in Alexandria belonged to
courtesans.“ Women of all classes moved freely through the streets,
shopped in the stores, and mingled with the men. Some of them made a
name for themselves in literature and scholarship.“ The Macedonian
queens and ladies of the court, from Ptolemy IPs Arsinoe to Antony’s
Cleopatra, took an active part in politics, and served policy rather
than love with their crimes; but they retained sufficient charm to
arouse the men to unprecedented gallantry, at least in poetry and prose,
and brought into Alexandrian society an element of feminine influence
and grace un- known in classic Greece.</p>
<p>Probably a fifth of Alexandria’s population was Jewish. As far
back</p>
<p>as the seventh century there had been Hebrew settlements in Egypt;
many Jewish traders had entered in the wake of the Persian conquest.
Alexander had urged Jews to emigrate to Alexandria, and had, according
to Josephus, offered them equal political and economic rights with the
Greeks.” Ptol - emy 1 , after taking Jerusalem, carried with him into
Egypt thousands of Jewish captives, who were freed by his successor;” at
the same time he invited well-to-do Hebrews to establish their homes and
businesses in Alexandria.“ By the beginning of the Christian era there
were a million Jews in Egypt.” A large number of these lived in the
Jewish quarter of the capital. It was no ghetto, for the Jews were free
to live in any quarter but the Brucheum, which was restricted to
official families and their servi-</p>

<p>ors. They chose their own gerousia or senate, and followed their own
worship. In 169 the high priest Onias III built a great temple at
Leontopolis, a suburb of Alexandria, and Ptolemy VI, his personal
friend, assigned the revenues of Heliopolis for its maintenance. Such
temples served as schools and meeting places as well as for religious
services; hence they were called by the Greek-speaking Jews synagogai,
i.e., places of assembly. Since few Egyptian Jews after the second or
third generation in Egypt knew Hebrew, the reading of the Law was
followed by an interpretation in Greek. Out of these explanations and
applications rose the custom of preaching a sermon on a text; and out of
the ritual came the first forms of the Catholic Mass.“</p>
<p>This religious and racial separation combined with economic rivalries
to arouse, towards the end of this period, an anti-Semitic movement in
Alex- andria. The Greeks and Egyptians alike were habituated to the
union of church and state, and frowned upon the cultural independence of
the Jews; furthermore, they felt the competition of the Jewish artisan
or business- man, and resented his energy, tenacity, and skill. When
Rome began to import Egyptian grain it was the Jewish merchants of
Alexandria who car- ried the cargoes in their fleets.“” The Greeks,
perceiving their failure to</p>
<p>The Jews did what they could to allay the resentment against
their</p>
<p>awixia — thandandandandi social separation — and their success.
Though they clung to their religion they spoke Greek, studied and wrote
about Greek literature, and translated their sacred books and their
histories into Greek. To ac- quaint the Greeks with the Jewish religious
tradition, and to enable the Jew who knew no Hebrew to read his own
scriptures, a group of Alexan- drian Jewish scholars began, probably
under Ptolemy II, a Greek transla- tion of the Hebrew Bible. The kings
favored the undertaking in the hope that it would make the Jews of Egypt
more independent of Jerusalem, and would lessen the flow of
Jewish-Egyptian funds to Palestine. Legend told how Ptolemy
Philadelphus, at the suggestion of Demetrius of Phalerum,</p>
<p>CHAP,XXV) EGYPT AND THE WEST 595</p>
<p>had invited some seventy Jewish scholars to come from Judea about 250
to translate the scriptures of their people; how the King had lodged
each of them in a separate room on Pharos, and had kept them without
inter- communication until each had made his own rendering of the
Pentateuch; how all the seventy versions, when finished, agreed word for
word, prov- ing the divine inspiration of the text and of the
translators; how the King rewarded the scholars with costly presents of
gold; and how from these circumstances the Greek version of the Hebrew
Bible came to be known as the hermeneia kata tons hebdomekonta — the
Interpretation according to the Seventy — m Latin, Interpretatio
Septuaginta {sc. Seniorum) — in a word, the “Septuagint.”*** Whatever
the process of translation, the Pentateuch seems to have appeared in
Greek before the close of the third century, and the Prophetic books in
the second.“ This was the Bible used by Philo and St. Paul.</p>
<p>The process of Hellenization in Egypt failed as completely with
the</p>
<p>natives as with the Jews. Outside of Alexandria the Egyptians
sullenly mdntained their own religion, their own dress or nudity, their
own im- memorial ways. The Greeks thought of themselves as conquerors,
not as fellow men; they did not bother to build Greek cities south of
the Delta, or to learn the language of the people; and their laws did
not recognize the marriage of an Egyptian with a Greek. Ptolemy I tried
to unite the Greek and native faiths by identifying Serapis and Zeus;
later Ptolemies encour- aged the cult of themselves as gods to offer a
common and convenient ob- ject of worship to their heterogeneous
population; but those Egyptians who were not courting office paid little
attention to these artificial cults. The Egyptian priests, shorn of
their wealth and power, and dependent for their sustenance upon grants
of money from the state, waited patiently for the Greek wave to recede.
In the end it was not Hellenism that won in Alexandria, but mysticism;
now w’^ere laid the foundations of Neo-Platonism and the medley of
promissory cults that competed for the Alexandrian soul in the centuries
that surrounded the birth of Christ. Osiris as Serapis became the
favorite god of the later Egyptians, and of many Egyptian Greeks; Isis
regained popularity as the goddess of women and motherhood. When
Christianity came neither the clergy nor the people found it impossible
to change Isis into Mary, and Serapis into Christ.</p>

<p>The lesson of Ptolemaic socialism is that even a government may ex-
ploit. Under the first two Ptolemies the system worked reasonably well:
great engineering enterprises were completed, agriculture was improved,
marketing was brought into order, the overseers behaved with a modest
measure of injustice and partiality, and though the exploitation of
mate- rials and men was thorough, its profits went in large degree to
develop and adorn the country, and to finance its cultural life. Three
factors ruined the experiment. The Ptolemies went to war, and spent more
and more of the people’s earnings upon armies, navies, and campaigns.
After Philadel - phus there was a rapid deterioration in the quality of
the kings; they ate and drank and mated, and allowed the administration
of the system to fall into the hands of rascals who ground every
possible penny out of the poor. The fact that the exploiters were
foreigners was never forgotten by the Egyptians, nor by the priests who
dreamed of the fleshpots of Egypt that their class had enjoyed before
the Persian and Greek domination.</p>
<p>The Ptolemaic conception of sociahsm was essentially one of
intensified production rather than of wide distribution. The fellah
received enough of his product to keep him alive, but not enough to
encourage him in his work or in the business of rearing a family.
Generation after generation the government’s exactions grew. The system
of detailed national control became intolerable, like the relentlessly
watchtul eye of a despotic parent. The state lent seed-com to the
peasant to plant his crop, and then bound him to the farm until the
harvest was in. No peasant might use any of his own product until all
his debts had been paid to the state. The fellah was patient, but even
he began to grumble. By the second century a substantial part of the
soil had been abandoned for lack of peasants to work it; the cleruchs or
lessees of royal land could get no tenants to till it for them; they
tried to do it themselves, but were not up to the task; gradually the
desert crept back upon civilization. In the gold mines of Nubia the
slaves worked naked in dark and narrow galleries, in cramping positions,
loaded with chains, and encouraged by the whip of the overseer; their
food was poor, not even enough to keep them alive; thousands of them
succumbed from malnutrition and fatigue; and the only welcome event in
their Uves was death.“ The common laborer in the factories received one
obol (nine cents) a day, the skilled worker two or three. Every tenth
day was a day of rest.</p>
<p>Complaints multiplied, and strikes grew more frequent: strikes
among</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) EGYPT AND THE WEST 597</p>
<p>he miners, the quarrymen, the boatmen, the peasants, the artisans,
the tradesmen, even the overseers and the pohce; strikes seldom for
better pay, since the toilers had ceased to hope for this, but of simple
exhaustion and despair. “We are worn out,” says a papyrus record of one
strike; “we will run away”— i.e., seek sanctuary in a temple.“ Nearly
all the exploiters were Greeks, nearly all the exploited were Egyptians
or Jews. The priests</p>
<p>clandestinely appealed to the religious feelings of the natives,
while the Greeks resented any concession made to Jews or Egyptians by
the gov- ernment. In the capital the populace was bribed by state
bounties and spectacles, but it was excluded from the royal quarter, was
watched by a large military force, and was allowed no voice in national
affairs; in the end it became an irresponsible and violent mob.“ In 2 16
the Egyptians revolted, but were put down; in 189 they revolted again,
and the mutiny continued for five years. The Ptolemies won for a time by
the force of their army, and by raising their contributions to the
priests; but the situation had be- come impossible. The country had been
milked to depletion, and even the exploiters felt that nothing
remained.</p>
<p>Disintegration set in on every side. The Ptolemies passed from
natural to unnatural vice, from intelligence to stupidity; they married
with a free- dom and haste that forfeited the esteem of their people;
luxury unfitted them for war or government, at last even for thought.
Lawlessness and dishonesty, incompetence and hopelessness, the absence
of competition and of the stimulus that comes from ownership, lowered
year by year the productivity of the land. Literature waned, creative
art died; after the third century Alexandria added little to either. The
Egyptians lost respect for the Greeks; the Greeks, if such a thing can
be believed, lost respect for themselves. Year by year they forgot their
own language, and spoke a corrupt mixture of Greek and Egyptian; more
and more of them married their sisters, after native custom, or married
into Egyptian families and were absorbed; thousands of them worshiped
Egyptian gods. By the second century the Greeks had ceased to be the
dominant race even politi- cally; the Ptolemies, to preserve their
authority, had adopted the Egyptian faith and ritual, and had increased
the power of the priests. As the kings sank into epicurean ease the
clergy reasserted its leadership, and won back year by year the lands
and privileges which the earlier Ptolemies had taken away.“ The Rosetta
Stone, dated 196 b.c., describes the coronation cere- monies of Ptolemy
V as following almost completely the Egyptian forms. Under Ptolemy V
(203-181) and Ptolemy VI (181-145) dynastic feuds absorbed the energies
of the royal house, while Egyptian agriculture and</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>598</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>industry decayed. Order and peace were not restored until Caesar, as
a mere incident in his career, took Egypt with hardly a blow, and
Augustus made it a province of Rome (30 b.c.).</p>
<p>V. SUNSET IN SICILY</p>
<p>The Hellenistic age faced east and south, and almost ignored the
west. Gy- rene prospered as usual, having learned that it is better to
trade than to war; out of it, in this period, came Callimachus the poet,
Eratosthenes the philosopher, and Carneades the philosopher. Greek Italy
was worried and weakened by the double challenge of multiplying natives
and rising Rome, while Sicily lived in daily fear of the Carthaginian
power. Twenty-three years after the coming of Timoleon a rich man’s
revolution suppressed the Syracusan democracy, and put the government
into the hands of six hundred oligarchic families (320). These divided
into factions, and were in turn overthrown by a radical revolution in
which four thousand persons were killed and six thousand of the well to
do were sent into banishment. Agathocles won dictatorship by promising a
can- cellation of debts and a redistribution of the land.“ So,
periodically, the concen - tration of wealth becomes extreme, and gets
righted by taxation or by revolu- tion.</p>
<p>After forty-seven years of chaos, during which the Carthaginians
repeatedly invaded the island, and Pyrrhus came, won, lost, and went,
Syracuse by un- merited good fortune fell into the power of Hieron II,
the most beneficent of the many dictators thrown up by the passions and
turbulence of the Sicilian Greeks. Hieron ruled for fifty- four years,
says the astonished Polybius, “with - out killing, exiling, or injuring
a single citizen, which indeed is the most remark- able of all things.
Surrounded by all the means of luxury, he led a modest and temperate
life, and lived to the age of ninety. On several occasions he wished to
resign his authority, but the people begged him to retain it.“ He had
the good judgment to make an alliance with Rome, and thereby kept the
Carthaginians at bay for half a century. He gave the city order and
peace, and considerable free- dom; he executed great public works, and
without oppressive taxation left a full treasury at his death. Under his
protection or patronage Archimedes brought ancient science to its
culmination, and Theocritus sang, in the last perfect Greek, the
loveliness of Sicily and the expected bounty of its king. Syracuse
became now the most populous and prosperous city in Hellas.“</p>
<p>Hieron amused his leisure by watching his artisans, under the
supervision of Archimedes, construct for him a pleasure boat that
embodied all the shipbuilding art and science of antiquity. It was half
a stadium (407 feet) in length; it had a sport deck with a gymnasium and
a large marble bath, and a shaded garden deck</p>
<p>EGYPT AND THE WEST</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>with a great variety of plants; it was manned by six hundred seamen
in twenty groups of oars, and could carry in addition three hundred
passengers or marines; it had sixty cabins, some with mosaic floors, and
doors of ivory and precious woods; it was elegantly furnished in every
part, and was adorned with paintings and statuary. It was protected
against attack by armor and turrets; from each of the eight turrets
great beams extended, with a hole at the end through which large stones
could be dropped upon enemy vessels; throughout its length Archi- medes
constructed a great catapult capable of hurling stones of three talents’
weight (174 pounds), or arrows twelve cubits (eighteen feet) long. It
could carry 3900 tons of cargo, and itself weighed a thousand tons.
Hieron had hoped to use it in regular service between Syracuse and
Alexandria; but finding it too large for his own docks, and
extravagantly expensive to maintain, he filled it with com and fish fro
m Sicily’s abounding fields and seas, and sent it, vessels and con -
tents, as a gift to Egypt, which was suffering an unusual dearth of
com.“</p>
<p>Hieron died in 216. He had wished to establish a democratic
constitution be- fore his death, but his daughters prevailed upon his
dotage to bequeath his power to his grandson.®® Hieronymus turned out to
be a weakling and a scoim- drel; he abandoned the Roman alliance,
received envoys from Carthage, and permitted them to become in effect
the rulers of Syracuse. Rome, not abounding in com, prepared to fight
Carthage for the wealth of an island that had never learned to govern
itself. All the Mediterranean world, like a decaying fmit, pre- pared to
fall into the hands of a greater and more mthless conqueror than Greek
history had ever known.</p>

<p>Books</p>
<p>I. LIBRARIES AND SCHOLARS</p>
<p>I N every field of Hellenistic life except the drama we find the
same</p>
<p>phenomenon — Greek civilization not destroyed but dispersed. Athens
was dying, and the Greek settlements of the west, barring Syracuse, were
in decay; but the Greek cities of Egypt and the East were at their
material and cultural zenith. Polybius, a man of wide experience,
historical knowl- edge, and careful judgment, spoke, about 148 b.c., of
“ the present day, when the progress of the arts and sciences has been
so rapid”;’ the words have a familiar ring. Through the dissemination of
Greek as a common tongue a cultural unity was now established which
would last in the east- ern Mediterranean for nearly a thousand years.
All men of education in the new empires learned Greek as the medium of
diplomacy, literature, and science; a book written in Greek could be
understood by almost any edu- cated non-Greek in Egypt or the Near East.
Men spoke of the oikowmene, or inhabited world, as one civilization, and
developed a cosmopolitan out- look less stimulating but perhaps more
sensible than the proud and narrow nationalism of the city-state.</p>
<p>For this enlarged audience thousands of writers wrote hundreds of
thou- sands of books. We know the names of eleven hundred Hellenistic
au- thors; the unknown are an incalculable multitude. A cursive script
had developed to facilitate writing; indeed, as early as the fourth
century b.c. we hear of systems of shorthand whereby “certain vowels and
consonants can be expressed by strokes placed in various positions.’”
Books were writ - ten on Egyptian papyrus until Ptolemy VI, hoping to
check the growth of the library at Pergamum, forbade the export of the
material from Egypt. Eumenes II countered by encouraging the mass
production of the treated skins of sheep and calves, which had long been
used for writing purposes in the East; and soon “parchment,” from the
city and the name of Perga - mum, rivaled paper as a vehicle of
communication and literature.</p>
<p>Books having grown to such numbers, libraries became a necessity.</p>

<p>potentates; but apparently Ari stotle’s library was the first
extensive pri - vate collection. We may conjecture its size and worth
from the fact that he paid 1 18,000 for that part of it which he bought
from Plato’s successor Speusippus. Aristotle bequeathed his books to
Theophrastus, who be- queathed them (287) to Neleus, who took them to
Scepsis in Asia Minor, where they were buried, says tradition, to escape
the literary cupidity of the Pergamene kings. After almost a century of
this damaging interment the volumes were sold about 100 b. c. to
Apellicon of Teos, an Athenian philosopher. Apellicon found that many
passages had been eaten away by the damp; he made new copies, filling in
the gaps as intelligently as he could;’ this may explain why Aristotle
is not the most fasci nating philoso- pher in history. When Sylla
captured Athens (86) he appropriated Apelli- con’s library and
transported it to Rome. There the Rhodian scholar</p>
<p>Andronicus reordered and published the texts of Aristotle’s works*—
an event almost as stimulating in the history of Roman thought as the
redis- covery of Aristotle was to prove in the awakening of medieval
philosophy.</p>
<p>The adventures of this collection suggest the debt that literature
owes to the Ptolemies for establishing and maintaining, as part of the
Museum, the famous Alexandrian Library. Ptolemy I began it, Ptolemy II
com- pleted it, and added a smaller library in the suburban sanctuary of
Serapis. By the end of Philadelphus’ reign the number of rolls had
reached 532,000 — making probably 100,000 books in our sense of this
word.’ For a time the enlargement of this collection rivaled the
strategy of power in the affections of the Egyptian kings. Ptolemy III
ordered that every book brought to Alexandria should be deposited with
the Library; that copies should be made, the owner to receive the copy,
the Library to retain the original. The same autocrat asked Athens to
lend him the manuscripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and
deposited 0,000 as security for their return; he kept the originals,
sent back copies, and told the Athenians to keep his money as a
forfeit.’ The ambition to possess old books became so widespread that
men arose who specialized in dyeing and spoiling new manuscripts to sell
them as antiquities to co llectors of first editions.’</p>
<p>The Library soon eclipsed the rest of the Museum in importance and
interest. The office of librarian was one of the highest in the king’s
gift, and included the obligation of tutoring the crown prince. The
names of these librarians have been preserved, with variations, in
different manu- scripts; the latest list’ gives, as the first six,
Zenodotus of Ephesus, Apol - lonius of Rhodes, Eratosthenes of Cyrene,
Apollonius of Alexandria, Aris- tophanes of Byzantium, and Aristarchus
of Samothrace; their diversity of</p>
<p>6o2</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>origin suggests again the unity of Hellenistic culture. Quite as
important as these was the poet and scholar Callimachus, who classified
the collec- tion in a catalogue running to one hundred and twenty rolls.
We picture a corps of copyists, presumably slaves, making duplicates of
precious orig- inals, and a hive of scholars separating the materials
into groups. Some of these men wrote histories of various departments of
literature or science, others edited definitive editions of the
masterpieces, others composed com- mentaries on these texts for the
enlightenment of laity and posterity. Aristophanes of Byzantium effected
a literary revolution by separating the clauses and sentences of the
ancient writings with capitals and marks of punctuation; and it was he
who invented the accents that so disturb us in reading Greek. Zenodotus
began, Aristophanes advanced, Aristarchus completed, the recension of
the Iliad and the Odyssey, establishing the present text, and
illuminating its obscurities in learned scholia. By the end of the third
century the Museum, the Library, and their scholars had made Alexandria,
in everything but philosophy, the intellectual capital of the Greek
world.</p>
<p>Doubtless other Hellenistic cities had libraries. Austrian
archeologists have exhumed the remains of an ornate municipal library at
Ephesus, and we hear of a great library being consumed in the
destruction of Carthage by Scipio. But the only one that evoked
comparison with Alexandria’s was that of Pergamum. The kings of this
transient state looked with enlightened envy upon the cultural
enterprises of the Ptolemies. In 196 Eumenes II established the
Pergamene Library, and brought to its halls some of the finest scholars
of Greece. The collection grew rapidly; when Antony presented it to
Cleopatra to replace that part of the Alexandrian Library which was
burned in the uprising against Caesar in 48 b.c., it num- bered some
200,000 rolls. Through this Ubrary, and the Attic taste of the Attalid
kings, Pergamum became, towards the end of the Hellenistic pe- riod, the
center of a purist school of Greek prose, which considered no word clean
that had not come down from classic days. To the enthusiasm of these
classicists we owe the preservation of the chef- d’oeuvres of Attic
prose.</p>
<p>It was above all an age of intellectuals and scholars. Writing became
a profession instead of a devotion, and generated cliques and coteries
whose appreciation of talent varied inversely as the square of its
distance from themselves. Poets began to write for poets, and became
artificial; scholars began to write for scholars, and became dull.
Thoughtful men felt that the creative inspiration of Greece was nearing
exhaustion, and that the</p>
<p>BOOKS</p>

<p>603</p>
<p>most lasting service they could render was to collect, shelter, edit,
and expound the literary achievements of a bolder time. They established
the methods of textual and literary criticism in almost all its forms.
They tried to sift out the best from the mass of existing manuscripts,
and to guide the reading of the people; they made lists of “best books,”
the “four heroic poets,” the “nine historians,” the “ten lyric poets,”
the “ten orators,” etc.® They wrote biographies of great writers and
scientists; they gathered and saved the fragmentary data which are now
all that we know concerning these men. They composed outlines of
history, literature, drama, science, and philosophy ;” some of these
“short cuts to knowledge” helped to pre - serve, some replaced and
unwittingly obliterated the original works that they summarized.
Saddened by the degeneration of Attic Greek into the Orientalized
“pidgin” Greek of their time, Hellenist ic scholars compiled
dictionaries and grammars, and the Library of Alexandria, in the manner
of the French Academy, issued edicts on the correct usage of the ancient
tongue. Without their learned and patient “ant industry” the wars, revo
- lutions, and catastrophes of two thousand years would have destroyed
even those “precious minims” which have been transmitted to us as the
ship - wrecked legacy of Greece.</p>

<li>THE BOOKS OF THE JEWS</li>
</ol>
<p>Through all the turmoil of the time the Jews maintained their
traditional love of scholarship, and produced more than their share of
the lasting literature of the age. To this period belong some of the
finest portions of the Bible. Near the- close of the third century a
Jewish poet (or poetess?) composed the lovely Song of Songs: here is all
the artistry of Greek verse from Sappho to Theocritus, but with
something undiscoverable in any Greek author of the time — an intensity
of imagination, a depth of feeling, and an idealist devotion strong
enough to welcome the body, as well as the soul, of love, and to turn
the flesh itself into spirit. Partly in Jerusalem, mostly in Alexandria,
partly in other cities of the eastern Mediterranean, Hellenistic Jews
wrote — in Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek — such masterpieces as
Ecclesiastes, Daniel, part of Proverbs and Psalms, and most of the
greater Apocrypha. They composed histories like Chronicles, novelettes
like Esther and Judith, and idyls of family life like the Book of Tobit.
The</p>
<p>Soferim changed the Hebrew script from the old Assyrian to the square
Syrian style, which has remained to this day.“ Since most of the Jews in
the Near East now spoke Aramaic rather than Hebrew, the scholars
explained</p>
<p>6o4 the life of Greece (chap. xjivi</p>
<p>he Scriptures in brief Aramaic Targums, or interpretations.
Schools</p>
<p>were opened for the study of the Torah, or Law, and the explanation
of its moral code to growing youth; such explanations, commentaries, and
illus- trations, handed down from teacher to pupil across the
generations, sup- plied in a later age most of the material of the
Talmud.</p>
<p>By the close of the third century the scholars of the Great Assembly
had completed the editing of the older literature, and had closed the
canon of the Old Testament;^ it was their judgment that the age of the
prophets was ended, and that literal inspiration had ceased. The result
was that many works of this epoch, full of wisdom and beauty, lost the
chance of divine collaboration, and fell into the unfortunate category
of Apocrypha.* The two books of Esdras may owe something of their
literary excellence to King James’ translators; but these can hardly be
credited with the touch - ing account of how Esdras asked the angel
Uriel to explain why the wicked prosper, the good suffer, and Israel is
in bondage; to which the angel an- swers, in powerful similes and yet
simple speech, that it is not given to the part to understand or judge
the whole.</p>
<p>The prologue of Ecclesiasticus describes it as a Greek translation,
com- pleted in 132, of discourses written in Hebrew two generations
before by the translator’s grandfather, Jesus the son of Sirach. This
Joshua ben Sirach was both a scholar and a man of affairs; after seeing
something of the world through travel he had settled down to make his
home a school for students; and to them he delivered these essays on the
wisdom of life.“ He denounces the rich Jews who have abandoned their
faith to cut a better figure in the Gentile world; he warns youth
against the courtesans who wait for it every- where; and he offers the
Law as still the best guide amid the evils and pit- falls of the world.
But he is no puritan. Unlike the Chasidim he has a good word to say for
harmless pleasure; and he protests against the mystics who reject
medicine on the ground that all maladies, having come from God, can be
cured by God alone. The book is rich in epigrams, of which the most
renowned brings together the rod and the child. “The number of whippings
laid to his account,” said Renan, “must be incalculable.”“ It is a noble
book, wiser and kinder than Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>• The Old Testament Apocrypha (lit. hidden) are those books that were
excluded from the Jewish canon of the Old Testament as uninspired, but
were included in the Roman Catholic Vulgate — i.e., the Latin
translation, by St. Jerome, of the Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible.
The chief O. T. Apocrypha are Ecclesiasticus, I and II Esdras, and I and
II Maccabees. The apocalyptic (i.e., revealing) books are those that
purport to contain pro- phetic divine revelations; such writines began
to appear about 250 b.c., and continued into the Christian era. Some
apocalypses, like the Book of Enoch, are comidered apocryphal and
uncanom’cal; others, like the Book of Revelation, are considered
canonical.</p>
<p>BOOKS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>605</p>
<p>In the twenty- fourth chapter of Ecclesiasticus we are told that
“Wisdom is the first product of God, created from the beginning of the
world.” Here</p>
<p>In the Book of Daniel the whole terror of the age of Antiochus IV
finds a voice. About 166, when the faithful had been persecuted to the
death for their beliefs, and ever larger enemies were advancing upon the
Macca- bean band, one of the Chasidim, probably, undertook to rekindle
the cour- age of the people by describing the sufferings and prophecies
of Daniel in the days of Nebuchadrezzar in Babylon. Copies of the book
passed secretly among the Jews; it was given out as the work of a
prophet who had lived three hundred and seventy years before, had borne
greater trials than any Jew under Antiochus, had emerged victorious, and
had predicted a like triumph for his race. And even if the virtuous and
faithful found indifferent fortune here, their reward would come at the
Last Judgment, when the Lord would welcome them into a heaven of
unending happiness, and plunge their persecutors into everlasting
hell.</p>
<p>All in all, the extant Jewish writings of this period may be
described as a mystic or imaginative literature of instruction,
edification, and consola- tion. To the Jews of earlier ages life itself
had been enough, and religion was not a flight from the world but a
dramatization of morals by the poetry of faith; a powerful God, ruling
and seeing all things, would reward vir- tue and punish vice in this
existence on earth. The Captivity had shaken this belief, the
restoration of the Temple had renewed it; it broke down under the
bludgeoning of Antiochus. Pessimism now had a clear field; and in the
writings of the Greeks the Jews found the most eloquent ex- posures of
the injustices and tragedies of life. Meanwhile Jewish contact with
Persian ideas of heaven and hell, of a struggle between good and
evil.</p>

<p>and the final triumph of good, offered an escape from the philosophy
of despair, and perhaps the ideas of immortality that had come down from
Egypt to Alexandria, and those that had animated the mysteries of
Greece, co-operated to inspire in the Jews of the Greek and Roman
periods that consoling hope which bore them up through all the
vicissitudes of their Temple and their state. From these Jews, and from
the Egyptians, Per- sians, and Greeks, the idea of eternal reward and
punishment would flow down into a new and stronger faith, and help it to
win a disintegrating world.</p>

<p>Like the other arts, the drama enjoyed in this age its greatest
quantitative pros- perity. Every city, almost every third-rate town, had
its theater. The actors, better organized than ever, were in great
demand, enjoyed high fees, and lived with characteristic superiority to
the morals of their time. Dramatists continued to turn out tragedies,
but, whether by accident or good taste, tradition has covered them with
oblivion’s balm. The mood of Hellenistic Athens, like ours today,
preferred the lighthearted, lightheaded, sentimental, happy-ending
stories of the New Comedy. Of this, too, only fragments remain; but we
have some discouraging samples of it in the pilferings of Plautus and
Terence, who com- posed their plays by translating and adapting
Hellenistic comedies. The high concerns of state and soul that aroused
Aristophanes are in the New Comedy put aside as too perilous for the
literary neck; usually the theme is domestic or private, and traces the
devious roads by which women are led to generosity, and men nevertheless
to matrimony. Love enters upon its triumphant career as master of the
boards; a thousand damsels in distress cross the stage, but achieve
honor and wedlock in the end. The old phallic dress is abandoned, and
the old phallic bawdiness; but the story circles narrowly about the
virginity of the leading lady, and virtue plays as small a role in it as
in our daily press. Since the actors wore masks, and the number of masks
was limited, the comic dramatist wove his plots of intrigue and mistaken
identity around a few stock characters whom the audience was always
delighted to recognize — the cruel father, the benevolent old man, the
prodigal son, the heiress mistaken for a poor girl, the bragging
soldier, the clever slave, the flatterer, the parasite, the physician,
the priest, the philosopher, the cook, the courtesan, the procuress, and
the pimp.</p>
<p>The masters of this comedy of manners in third-century Athens were
Phi- lemon and Menander. Of Philemon hardly anything survives except the
echo of his renown. The Athenians liked him better than Menander, and
gave him more prizes; but Philemon had raised to high excellence the art
of organizing a claque. Posterity, being ignored in the subsidy,
reversed the judgment, and gave</p>
<p>BOOKS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>607</p>
<p>he crown to Menander’s bones. This Co ngreve of Athens was a nephew
of the fertile dramatist Alexis of Thurii, the pupil of Theophrastus,
and the friend of Epicurus; from them he learned the secrets of drama,
philosophy, and tran- quillity. He almost realized Aristotle’s ideal; he
was hands ome and rich, con- templated life with serenity and
understanding, and took his pleasures like a gentleman. He was an
inconstant lover, content to repay Glycera’s devotion by touching her
name with immortality. When Ptolemy I invited him to Alex- andri a he
sent Philemon in his stead, saying, “Philemon has no Glycera”; Gly -
cera, who had suffered much, rejoiced at having triumphed over a king.“
There - after, we are assured, he lived faithfully with her until, at
the age of fifty-two, he died of a cram p while swimming at the Piraeus
(292).“</p>
<p>His first play, as if announcing a new epoch, appeared in the year
that fol- lowed Alexander’s death. Thereafter he wrote one hundred and
four comedies, eight of which won the first prize. Some four thousand
lines remain, all in brief fragments except for a papyrus discovered in
Egypt in 1905; this contains half of the Epitrepontes, or The
Arbitrants, and has lowered Menander’s reputation. We shall waste our
reproaches if we complain that the themes of these plays are as
monotonous as those of Greek sculpture, architec :ure, and pottery; we
must remind ourselves that the Greeks judged a work not by the story it
told — which is a child’s criterion— but by the manner of its telling.
What the Greek mind relished in Menander was the neat polish of his
style, the philosophy concen- trated in his wit, and so realistic a
portrayal of common scenes that Aristophanes of Byzantium asked, “O
Menander, O Life, which of you imitated the other In a world that had
fallen forfeit to soldiers nothing remained, in Menander’s view, but to
contemplate human affairs as a spectator indulgent but uninvolved. He
notes the vanities and vacillations of woman, but concedes that the
average wife is a blessing. The action of The Arbitrants turns in part
upon a rejection of the double standard;’® and of course one play is
about the virtuous prostitute who, like Dumas’ Lady of the Camellias,
refuses the man whom she loves in order to get him respectably married
to a profitable wife.’ ® Lines that are now proverbs appear in the
fragments, like “Evil communications corrupt good manners” (quoted by
St. Paul®®), and “Conscience makes cowards of the bravest men”;®* some
credit Menander with the original of Terence’s famous ’^nQ— Homo suniy
humani nil a me alienum puto — ’l am a man, and consider nothing human
to be alien to me.” Occasionally we come upon jewels of insight, as in
“Everything that dies dies by its own corruption; all that injures is
within”;*® or in these typical</p>

<li>THEOCRITUS</li>
</ol>
<p>When Philemon died (262) Greek comedy, and in large measure Athenian
literature, died with him. The theater flourished, but it produced no
master- pieces that time or scholarship thought fit to preserve; and the
repetition of old comedies — chiefly those of Menander and Philemon —
more and more crowded out original productions. As the third century
ended, the spirit of the gay so- ciety that had generated the New Comedy
died away, and was replaced in Athens by the serious mood of the
philosophical schools. Other cities, Alex- andria in particular, tried
to transplant the dramatic art, but failed.</p>
<p>The great Library and the scholars whom it had attracted set the tone
of Alex- andrian literature. Books had to meet the tastes of a learned
and critical audi- ence, sophisticated by science and history. Even
poetry became erudite, and tried to cover up the poverty of its fancy
with recondite allusions and subtle turns of phrase. Callimachus wrote
dead hymns to dead gods, pretty epigrams that sparkled for a day,
judicious eulogies like The Lock of Berenice, and a didactic poem on
Causes (Aitia) which contained much learned lore from ge- ography,
mythology, and history, and one of the earliest love stories in
literature. Acontius, hero of this tale, is incredibly handsome, and
Cydippe is painfully beautiful; they fall in love at first sight, are
opposed by their money-minded parents, direaten suicide, half die of
broken hearts, and finally end the romance with marriage; this is the
story that a million poets and novelists have told since then, and which
a million more will tell. It must be added, however, that in one of his
epigrams Callimachus returned to more orthodox Greek tastes:</p>
<p>Drink now, and love, Democrates; for we</p>
<p>Shall not have wine an d boys eternally.”</p>
<p>His only rival in his century was his pupil Apollonius of Rhodes.
When the student poached upon the master’s verses and competed for the
favor of the Ptolemies, the two men quarreled in life and print, and
Apollonius returned to</p>
<p>BOOKS</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVl)</p>
<p>609</p>
<p>Rhodes. He proved his courage by writing, in an age that preferred
brevity, a very passable epic, the Argonautica. Callimachus dismissed it
with an epigram — “A big book is a big evil”— of whose truth the reader
may find an instance at close hand. In the end Apollonius was rewarded;
he received the coveted ap- pointment of librarian, and even persuaded
some of his contemporaries to read his epic. It still survives, and
contains an excellent psychological study of Medea’s l ove; but it is
not indispensable to a modem education.*</p>
<p>The rise of pastoral poetry betrays almost statistically the growth
of an urban civilization. The Greeks of earlier centuries had said
little about the beauty of the countryside because most of them had once
lived on farms or near them, and knew the lonely hardships, as well as
the quiet beauty, of rural life. Doubtless the Alexandria of the
Ptolemies was as hot and dusty as Alexandria is today, and the Greeks
who lived in it looked back with idealizing memory upon the hills and
fields of their motherland; the great city was just the place to breed
bucolic poetry. Thither came, about 276, a confident young man with the
pleasant name of Theocritus. He had begun life in Sicily, and had
continued it in Cos; he had returned to Syracuse to seek the patronage
of Hieron II, and had failed; but he could never forget the beauty of
Sicily, its mountains and flowers, its coasts and bays. He moved to
Alexandria, composed a panegyric on Ptolemy II, and won the passing
favor of the court. For some years he seems to have lived amid royalty
and scholarship, while his melodious pictures of coun- try life made him
popular among the sophisticates of the capital. His Praxinoa describes
the terror of Alexan dria’s crowded streets:</p>
<p>O Heavens, what a mob! I can’t imagine</p>
<p>How we’re to squeeze through, or how long it’ll take;</p>
<p>An ant-heap is nothing to this hurly-burly…</p>
<p>O Gorgon, darling, look! — what shall we do?</p>
<p>The royal cavalry! Don’t ride us dow n!</p>
<p>Eunoa, get out of the way!”</p>
<p>How could a man with the soul of a poet and memories of Sicily be</p>
<p>happy in such an environment? He praised the King for bread, but fed
his spirit on fancies of his native island, and perhaps of Cos; he
envied the simple life of the shepherd pacing with his placid animals
grassy slopes overlooking sunny seas. In this mood he perfected the idyl
— the eidyllion or little picture — and gave it the connotation that it
keeps today, of a rustic cameo or a poetic tale. Only ten of the
thirty-two pieces that have come</p>

for line, in the Aeneid^</p>
<p>6io</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>down to us from Theocritus are pastoral poetry; but these have set a
half- rural stamp upon the name that covers them all. Here at last
nature en- tered Greek literature, not as a goddess merely, but as the
living and lov- able features of the earth. Never before had Greek
literature conveyed so feelingly the secret sense of kinship that stirs
the soul with gratitude and affection for rocks and streams, water and
soil and sky.</p>
<p>But another theme reaches even more deeply into the heart of
Theocritus — romantic love. He is still a Greek, indites two lyrics {xii
and xxix) to homosexual friendship, and tells with vivid sentiment the
story of Heracles and Hylas (»VV) — how the giant, “who withstood the
ferocity of the lion, loved a youth and taught him like a father
everything by which he might become a good and illustrious man; nor
would he leave the lad at dawn, or noon, or evening, but sought
continually to fashion him after his own heart, and to make him a right
yoke- fellow with him in mighty deeds.” A more famous idyl (i) rehearses
Stesichorus’ tale of Daphnis the Si cilian shepherd, who piped and sang
so well that legend made him the inventor of bucolic (i.e., cow-tending)
poetry. For a while Daphnis watched his herd, and envied their amorous
play. When the first hair had sprouted on his Up a divine nymph fell in
love with him, and had him for her mate. But as the price of her favors,
she made him swear that he would never love another woman. He tried hard
to keep his vow, and succeeded till a king’s daughter became enamored of
his youth and gave herself to him iii the fields. Aphrodite saw it, and
revenged her fellow goddess by making Daphnis waste away with unrequited
love. As he died he bequeathed his pipe to Pan in a song to which the
narrator adds a haunting refrain:</p>
<p>“Master, approach; take to thee thi s fair pipe</p>
<p>Bedded in wax that breathes of honey still.</p>
<p>Bound at the lips with twine. For Love has come</p>
<p>To hale me off unto the house of Death.”</p>
<p>Muses, forego, forego the pastoral song.</p>
<p>“Now let the briar and the thisde flower</p>
<p>With violets, and the fair narcissus bloom</p>
<p>On junipers; let all things go awry.</p>
<p>And pines grow pears, since Daphnis is for death.</p>
<p>Let stags pursue the hounds, and from the hills</p>
<p>The screeching owls outsing the nightingales.”</p>
<p>Muses, forego, forego the pastoral song.</p>

<p>So said he then — no more. And Aphrodite</p>
<p>Was fain to raise him; but the Destinies</p>
<p>Had spun his thread right out. So Daphnis went</p>
<p>Down-stream; the whirlpool closed above his head,</p>

<p>The second idyl continues the theme of love, but in a fiercer
mood.</p>
<p>Simaetha, maid of Syracuse, seduced and deserted by Delphis, seeks to
command his love by filters and charms; if she fails she is resolved to
poison him. Standing under the stars she tells Selene, goddess of the
moon, with what hot jealousy she saw Delphis walking with his
comrade.</p>
<p>Scarce had we reached the midpoint -of the road by the dwelling of
Lycon,</p>
<p>Delphis when I beheld with Eudanippus advancing:</p>
<p>Blonder of cheek and chin were the youths than yellowing ivy,</p>
<p>Yea, and their breasts far brighter of sheen than thou, O Selene,</p>
<p>Showing they just had come from the noble toil of the wrestlers.</p>
<p>Think on my love, and think whence it came, thou Lady Selene.</p>
<p>I, when I saw, how I raged, how the flame took hold of my bosom.</p>
<p>Burned my love-lost heart! My beauty waned, and no longer</p>
<p>Watched I the pomp as it passed; nor how I returned to my home-</p>
<p>stead</p>
<p>Knew I, for some fell bane, some parching disease had undone me.</p>
<p>Ten days, stretched on my bed, and ten nights dwelt I in anguish.</p>
<p>Think on my love, and think whence it came, thou Lady Selene.</p>
<p>Often the bloom of my flesh grew dry and yellow as dye-wood.</p>
<p>Yea, and the hairs of my head fell off, and of all that I once
was</p>
<p>Naught but skin was left, and bones; and to whom did I not turn.</p>
<p>Whose road left I unsought where an old crone chanted a love-</p>
<p>charm?</p>
<p>Still no solace I found, and time sped ever a-flying.</p>
<p>Think on my love, and think whence it came, thou Lady Selene.</p>
<p>The third idyl introduces us to the nymph Amaryllis, and her
unattain- able charms; the fourth to the shepherd Corydon, the seventh
to the poetic goatherd Lycidas — names destined to be invoked by a
thousand poets again from Virgil to Tennyson. These rustics are
idealized, and speak the most</p>

<p>exquisite Greek; any one of them can sing hexameters lovelier
than</p>
<p>Homer’s; but we learn to accept their incredible gifts as a tolerable
con- vention when we surrender to the plaintive lilt of their songs.
Theocritus redeems their reality with the smell of their jackets and the
occasional obscenity of their thoughts; a lusty vein of humor salts
their sentiment, and makes them men. All in all, this is the most
perfect Greek poetry writ- ten after Euripides, the only extant
Hellenistic verse that has the breath of life.</p>
<p>V. POLYBIUS</p>
<p>If the Hellenistic age inspired but one great poet, it produced an
un- precedented quantity and variety of prose. It invented the imaginary
con- versation, the essay, and the encyclopedia; it continued the
tradition of writing brief and vivid biographies; and in the Roman
sequel Greek litera- ture would add the sermon and the novel. Oratory
was a dying mode, for it had depended upon the game of politics,
litigation before popular courts, and the democratic right to talk. The
letter became a favorite vehicle, for both communication and literature;
now were established the epistolary forms and phrases that we find in
Cicero, and even the famous exordium dear to our grandfathers: “Hoping
that this finds you as well as it leaves me.</p>
<p>Historiography flourished. Ptolemy I, Aratus of Achaea, and Pyrrhus
of Epirus wrote memoirs of their campaigns, establishing a tradition
that cul- minated in Caesar. The Egyptian high priest Manetho wrote in
Greek an Aigyptiaka, or Annals of Egypt, which bundled the Pharaohs
somewhat arbitrarily into those dynasties that classify them to this
day. Berosus, high priest of the Chaldeans, dedicated to Antiochus I a
history of Babylon based upon the cuneiform records. Megasthenes,
ambassador of Seleucus I to Chandragupta Maurya, startled the Greek
world, about 300, with a book on India. “There is among the Brahmans,”
said a suggestive passage, “a sect of philosophers who… hold that God is
the Word, by which they mean not articulate speech but the discourse of
reason”;” here again was that doctrine of Logos which was destined to
make such an impress upon Christian theology. Timaeus af Tauromenium
(Taormina), having been exiled from Sicily by Agathocles (317), traveled
widely in Spain and</p>
<p>Gaul, and then settled down in Athens to write a history of Sicily
and the West. He was an industrious student, so anxious to include
everything that some of his rivals called him “an old ragpicker.”” He
labored to arrive at</p>
<p>BOOKS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>613</p>
<p>an accurate chronology, and hit upon the scheme of dating events by
Olympiads. He criticized his predecessors severely, and was lucky enough
to die before seeing the brutal attack made upon his work by
Polybius.”</p>
<p>The greatest of the Hellenistic historians, and the only Greek fit
to</p>
<p>make a triad with Herodotus and Thucydides, was bom at Megalopolis,
in Arcadia (208). His father, Lycortas, was one of the leading men of
the Achaean League, being ambassador to Rome in 189 and strategos in
184. The boy was brought up in the odor of politics, was trained as a
soldier under Philopoemen, fought in the Roman campaign against the
Gauls in Asia Minor, was associated with his father on an embassy to
Egypt (181), and was made the League’s hipparchos, or commander of the
cavalry, in</p>
<p>169.“ He paid for his prominence: when the Romans punished the League
for supporting Perseus against them they took a thousand leading
Achaeans to Rome as hostages, and Polybius was among them (167). For
sixteen years he suffered exile, and at times, he tells us, “utter loss
of spirit a nd paralysis of mind.”“ But the younger Scipio befriended
him, introduced him to the Scipionic circle of educated Romans, and
persuaded the Sen- ate, when it was scattering the other exiles
throughout Italy, to let Polybius live with him in Rome. He accompanied
Scipio on many campaigns, gave him valuable military advice, explored
for him the coasts of Spain and Africa, and stood beside him at the
burning of Carthage (146). He had received his freedom in 151, and m 149
he was employed as the represen- tative of Rome in arranging a modus
vivendi between the cities of Greece and their distant master, the Roman
Senate. He must have performed this ungrateful task well, for several
cities honored him with monuments — though one can never tell in what
ten se man’s gratitude is felt. Having lived through sixty full years of
action, he retired to write a Treatise on Tactics, a Life of
Philopoemen, and his immense Histories. He died like a gentleman by
falling from his horse as he was returning from a hunt, at the age of
eighty-two.</p>
<p>No man ever wrote history from a wider background of education,</p>
<p>ravel, and experience. His work was conceived on a grand scale, and
pro- posed to tell the story, not only of Greece but of “the whole
world”</p>
<p>(i.e., the Medit erranean nations) from 221 to 146 b. c. “Such is the
plan I propose; but all depends upon Fortune’s granting me a life long
enough to execute it.”“ He rightly felt that the center of political
history, in the pe - riod which he covered, lay in Rome; he gave his
book unity by making Rome the focus of its events, and studying with a
diplomat’s curiosity the methods by which Rome, with British casualness,
had mastered the Medi-</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>614</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>erranean world.“ He admired the Romans intensely, for he had seen
them in their greatest epoch, and had known chiefly the best of them in
Scipio’s group; they had, he felt, just those qualities that were
fatally lacking in Greek character and government. Himself an
aristocrat, and befriended by aristocrats, he had no sympathy with what
seemed to him mere mob rule in the later stages of Greek democracy.
Political history appeared to him to be a repetitious cycle of monarchy
(or dictatorship), aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and monarchy. The
best escape from this cycle, he thought, was through a “mixed
constitution” like that of Lycurgus or Rome— an enfranchised but limited
citizenry choosing its own magistrates, but checked by the power of a
continuous and aristocratic senate.“ It was from this viewpoint that he
wrote down the record of his times.</p>
<p>Polybius is “the historians’ historian” because he is as interested
in his method as in his subject. He likes to talk about his plan of
procedure, and philosophizes at every opportunity. Humanly he pictures
his own quali- fications as ideal. He insists that history should be
written by those who have seen — or have directly consulted others who
have seen — the events to be described. He denounces Timaeus for having
relied on his ears rather than his eyes, and tells with pride of his own
travels in search of data, documents, and geographical veracity; he
reminds us how, in returning from Spain to Italy, he crossed the Alps by
the same pass that Hannibal had used, and how he went down into the very
toe of Italy to decipher an inscription left by Hannibal in Brutium.” He
proposes to make his history as accurate as “the magnitude of the work
and its comprehensive treat - ment” will allow;“ and he succeeds, so far
as we can sa y, better than any other Greek except Thucydides. He argues
that the historian should have been a man of affairs, versed in the
actual processes of statesmanship, poli- tics, and war; otherwise he
will never understand the behavior of states or the course of history.“
He is a realist and a rationalist; he pierces the moral phrases of
diplomats to the actual motives of policy. It amuses him to observe how
easily men can be deceived, singly or en masse, and even repeatedly by
the same tricks.“ “What is good,” says a scandalous presage of
Machiavelli, “very seldom coincides with what is advantageous, and few
are those who can combine the two and adapt them to each other.”“ He
accepts the Stoic theology of a Divine Providence, but he merely pities
the popular cults of his day, and smiles at stories of supernatural
interven- tion.“ He recognizes the role of chance in history, and the
occasional efficacy of great men,“ but he is resolved to lay bare the
factual and often impersonal chain of causes and effects, so that
history may be a lantern of</p>
<p>BOOKS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>615</p>
<p>understanding held up to the present and the future.“ “There is no
more ready corrective of conduct than knowledge of the past”; and “the
sound - est education and training for a life of active politics is the
study of his- tory”;“ “it is history, and history alone, which, without
involving us in actual danger, will mature our judgment and prepare us
to take right views, whatever may be the crisis or the posture of
affairs.”“ The best method of history, he thinks, will be that which
sees the life of a nation as an or- ganic unity, and weaves the story of
each part into the life history of the whole. “He who believes that by
studying isolated histories he can acquire a just view of history as a
whole is, as it seems to me, much in the case of one who, after having
looked at the dissevered limbs of an animal once alive and beautiful,
fancies he has been as good as an eyewitness of the creature itself in
all its action an d grace.”“</p>
<p>Of the forty books into which Polybius divided his Histories, time
has preserved five, and the epitomists have rescued substantial
fragments of the rest. It is a great pity that the execution of this
vast conception is marred by degenerate Greek, peevish critiques of
other historians, an almost exclusive preoccupation with politics and
war, and an absurd segmenta- tion of the narrative into Olympiads,
giving the history of all the Mediter- ranean nations in each four-year
period, and leading to exasperating digres- sions and a baffling
discontinuity. Sometimes, as in the story of Hannibal’s invasion,
Polybius mounts to drama and eloquence, but he reacts so strongly
against the florid rhetoric popular among his immediate predecessors
that he makes it a point of honor to be dull.“ “No one,” said an ancient
critic, “ever read him through.”“ The world has almost forgotten him;
but his - torians will long continue to study him because he was one of
the greatest theorists and practitioners of historiography; because he
dared to take a wide view and write a “universal history”; and because,
above all, he un - derstood that mere facts are worthless except through
their interpretation, and that the past has no value except as our roots
and our illumination.</p>
