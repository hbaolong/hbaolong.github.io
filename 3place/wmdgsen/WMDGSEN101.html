<p>The Greeks in the West</p>
<p>I. THE SYBARITES</p>
<p>S KIRTING Sunium again, our ship of fancy, sailing westward,
finds</p>
<p>Cythera, island haunt of Aphrodite, and therefore the goal of
Wat-</p>
<p>teau’s Embarkation* There, about a.d. i6o, Pausanias saw “the most
holy and ancient of all the temples that the Greeks have built to
Aphrodite”;’ and there, in 1887, Schliema nn dug its ruins out of the
earth.’ Cythera was the southernmost of the Ionian Islands that bordered
the west coast of Greece, and so named because Ionian immigrants settled
them; Zacynthos, Cephal- lenia, Ithaca, Leucas, Paxos, and Corcyra made
the rest. Schliemann thought that Ithaca was the island of Odysseus, and
vainly sought under its soil some confirmation of Homer’s tale;’ but
Dorpfeld believed that Odysseus’ home was on rocky Leucas. From the
cliffs of Leucas, as an annual sacri- fice to Apollo, the ancient
Leucadians, says Strabo, were in the habit of hurling a human victim;
but being men as well as theologians, they merci- fully attached to him
powerful birds whose wings might break his fall:’ probably the story of
Sappho’s leap is bound up with memories of this rite. Corinthian
colonists occupied Corcyra (Corfu) about 734 b.c., and soon became so
strong that they defeated Corinth’s navy and established their
independence. From Corcyra some Greek adventurers sailed up the Adriatic
as far as Venice; some made small settlements on the Dalmatian coast and
in the valley of the Po;’ others crossed at last through fifty miles of
stormy water to the heel of Italy.</p>
<p>They found a magnificent shore line, curved into natural harbors and
backed by a fertile hinterland that had been almost neglected by the
aborigines.* The Greek invaders took possession of this coastal region
by the ruthless law of colonial expansion — that natural resources unex-
ploited by the native population will draw in, by a kind of chemical
attrac- tion, some other people to exploit them and pour them into the
commerce and usage of the world. From Brentesium (Brindisi) the
newcomers, chiefly Dorian, traversed the heel of the peninsula to
establish a major city</p>
<p>• Watteau’s painting. Embarkation for Cythera^ syn’ibolized the
spirit of the upper classes in eighteenth-century France, which had shed
just enough theology to be epicurean. 159</p>
<p>l6o THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>at Taras — the Roman Tarentum (Taranto) .* There they grew olives,
raised horses, manufactured pottery, built ships, netted fish, and
gathered mus- sels to make a purple dye more highly valued than the
Phoenician/ As in most of the Greek colonies, the government began as an
oligarchy of land- owners, passed under dictators financed by the middle
class, and enjoyed vigorous and turbulent intervals of democracy. Here
the romantic Pyrrhus would land, in 281 b.c., and undertake to play
Alexander to the West.</p>
<p>Across the Tarentine Gulf a new wave of immigrants, mostly Achaeans,
founded the cities of Sybaris and Crotona. The murderous jealousy of
these kindred states illustrates the creative energy and destructive
passions of the Greeks. Trade between eastern Greece and western Italy
had a choice of two routes, one by water, the other in part by land.
Ships fol- lowing the water route touched at Crotona, and exchanged many
goods there; thence they passed to Rhegium, paid tolls, and moved
cautiously through pirate-ridden seas and the swirling currents of the
Messina Straits to Elea and Cumae — the northernmost Greek settlement in
Italy. To avoid these tolls and perils, and a hundred extra miles of
rowing and sailing, mer- chants who chose the other route unloaded their
cargoes at Sybaris, car- ried them overland some thirty miles to the
western coast at Laus, and reshipped them to Poseidonia, whence they
were marketed into the in- terior of Italy.</p>
<p>Strategically situated on this line of trade, Sybaris prospered until
it had (if we may believe Diodorus Siculus”) 300,000 population and such
wealth as few Greek cities could match. Sybarite became a synonym for
epicurean. All physical labor was performed by slaves or serfs while the
citizens, dressed in costly robes, took their ease in luxurious homes
and consumed exotic delicacies.! Men whose work was noisy, such as
carpenters and smiths, were forbidden to practice their crafts within
the confines of the city. Some of the roads in the richer districts were
covered with awnings as a p rotection against heat and rain.“
Alcisthenes of Sybaris, says Aris - totle, had a robe of such precious
stuffs that Dionysius I of Syracuse later sold it for 120 talents
(20,000).“ Smyndyrides of Sybaris, visiting Sicyon to sue for the hand
of Cleisth enes’ daughter, brought with him a thousand servants.“</p>
<p>• The traditional dates for the founding of the Greek cities in the
West are given in the</p>
<p>f Cooks or confectioners who invented new dishes or sweets —
Athenaeus reports — were allowed to patent them for a year.“ Perhaps
Athenaeus mistook caricature for history.</p>
<p>THE GREEKS IK THE WEST</p>
<p>CHAP, vn)</p>
<p>All went well with Sybaris until it slipped into war with its
neighbor</p>
<p>Crotona (510). We are unreliably informed that the Sybarites marched
out to battle with an army of 300,000 men.“ The Crotoniates, we are fur
- ther assured, threw this force into confusion by playing the tunes to
which the Sybarites had taught their horses to dance.” The horses
danced, the Sybarites were slaughtered, and their city was so
conscientiously sacked and burned that it disappeared from history in a
day. When, sixty-five years later, Herodotus and other Athenians
established near the site the new colony of Thurii, they found hardly a
trace of what had been the proudest community in Greece.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>PYTHAGORAS OF CROTONA</li>
</ol>
<p>Crotona lasted longer; founded about 710 b.c., it is, as Crotone,
still noisy with industry and trade. It had the only natural harbor
between Taras and Sicily, and could not forgive those ships that
discharged their cargoes at Sybaris. Enough trade remained to give the
citizens a comfortable pros- perity, while a wholesome defeat in war, a
long economic depression, a brisk climate, and a certain Dorico-Puritan
mood in the population con- spired to keep them vigorous despite their
wealth. Here grew famous ath- letes like Milo, and the greatest school
of medicine in Magna Grecia.*</p>
<p>Perhaps it was its reputation as a health resort that drew Pythagoras
to Crotona. The name means “mouthpiece of the Pythian” oracle at Delphi;
many of his followers considered him to be Apollo himself, and some laid
claim to having caught a flash of his golden thigh.” Tradition assigned
his birth to Samos about 580, spoke of his studious youth, and gave him
thirty years of travel. “Of all men,” says Heracleitus, who praised
parsimoni - ously, “Pythagoras was the most assiduous inquirer.”” He
visited, we are told, Arabia, Syria, Phoenicia, Chaldea, India, and
Gaul, and came back with an admirable motto for tourists: “When you are
traveling abroad look not back at your own borders”;” prejudices should
be checked at every port of entry. More surely he visited Egypt, where
he studied with the priests and learned much astronomy and geometry, and
perhaps a lit- tle nonsense.” Returning to Samos and finding that the
dictatorship of Polycrates interfered with his own, he migrated to
Crotona, being now over fifty years of age.”</p>
<p>There he set up as a teacher; and his imposing presence, his varied
leam^t ing, and his willingness to receive women as well as men into his
school.</p>

Italy.</p>

<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>soon brought him several hundred students. Two centuries before Plato
he laid down the principle of equal opportunity for both sexes, and did
not merely preach it but practiced it. Nevertheless he recognized
natural dif- ferences of function; he gave his women pupils considerable
training in philosophy and literature, but he had them instructed as
well in maternal and domestic arts, so that the “Pythagorean women” were
honored by antiquity as the highest feminine type rfiat Greece ever
produced.®</p>
<p>For the students in general Pythagoras established rules that almost
turned the school into a monastery. The members bound themselves by a
vow of loyalty, both to the Master and to one another. Ancient tradi-
tion is unanimous that they practiced a communistic sharing of goods
while they lived in the Pythagorean community.® They were not to eat
flesh, or eggs, or beans. Wine was not forbidden, but water was
recommended — a dangerous prescription in lower Italy today. Possibly
the prohibition of flesh food was a religious taboo bound up with the
belief in the trans- migration of souls: men must beware of eating their
ancestors. Probably there were dispensations, now and then, from the
letter of these rules; English historians in particular find it
incredible that the wrestler Milo, who was a Pythagorean, had become the
strongest man in Greece without the help of beef“— though the calf that
became a bull in his arms* managed well enough on grass. The members
were forbidden to kiU any animal that does not injure man, or to destroy
a cultivated tree. They were to dress simply and behave modestly, “never
yielding to laughter, and yet not looking stem.” They were not to swear
by the gods, for “every man ought so to live as to be worthy of belief
without an oath.” They were not to offer victims in sacrifice, but they
might worship at altars that were unstained with blood. At the close of
each day they were to ask them- selves what wrongs they had committed,
what duties they had neglected, what good they had done.®</p>
<p>Pythagoras himself, unless he was an excellent actor, followed these
rules more rigorously than any student. Certainly his mode of life won
for him such respect and authority among his pupils that no one grumbled
at his pedagogical dictatorship, and mtos epha — ipse dixit — ’he
himself has said it”— became their formula for affinal decision in
almost any field of con- duct or theory. We are told, with touching
reverence, that the Master never drank wine by day, and liyfed for the
most part on bread and honey, with vegetables as dessert; that his robe
was always white and spotless;</p>
<p>Cf. Chap. DC, sect, iv, below.</p>
<p>CHAP.Vn) THE GREEKS IN THE WEST 163</p>
<p>that he was never known to eat too much, or to make love; that he
never indulged in laughter, or jests, or stories; that he never
chastised any one, not even a slave* Timon of Athens thought him “a
juggler of solemn speech, engaged in fishing for men”;” but among his
most devoted followers were his wife Theano and his daughter Damo, who
had facilities for com- paring his philosop hy with his life. To Damo,
says Diogenes Laertius, “he entrusted his Commentaries, and charged her
to divulge them to no person out of the house. And she, though she might
have sold his discourses for much money, would not abandon them, for she
thought obedience to her father’s injunctions more valuable than gold;
and that, too, though she was a woman.”*</p>
<p>Initiation into the Pythagorean society required, in addition to
purifica- tion of the body by abstinence and self-control, a
purification of the mind by scientific study. The new pupil was expected
to preserve for five years the “Pythagorean silence”— i.e., presumably,
to accept instruction without questions or argument — before being
accounted a full member, or being permitted to “see” (study un der.^)
Pythagoras.* The scholars were ac- cordingly divided into exoterici, or
outer students, and esoterici, or inner members, who were entitled to
the secret wisdom of the Master himself. Four subjects composed the
curriculum: geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music. Mathematics came
first;* not as the practical science that the Egyptians had made it, but
as an abstract theory of quantities, and an ideal logical training in
which thinking would be compelled to order and clarity by the test of
rigorous deduction and visible proof. Geometry now defi- nitely received
the form of axiom, theorem, and demonstration; each step in the sequence
of propositions raised the student to a new platform, as the
Pythagoreans put it, from which he might view more widely the secret
structure of the world.” Pythagoras himself, according to Greek
tradition, discovered many theorems: above all, that the sum of the
angles within any triangle equals two right angles, and that the square
of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the
squares of the other two sides. Apollodorus tells us that when the
Master discovered this theorem he sacrificed a hecatomb — a hundred
animals — in thanksgiving;“ but this would have been scandalously
un-Pythagorean.</p>
<p>From geometry, inverting the modem order, Pythagoras passed to arith-
• The Pythagoreans appear to have been the first to use the word

<p>164 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VH</p>
<p>metic — not as a practical art of reckoning, but as the abstract
theory of numbers. The school seems to have made the first
classification of num- bers into odd or even, prime or factorable it
formulated the theory</p>
<p>of proportion, and through this and the “application of areas”
created a geometrical algebra.“ Perhaps it was the study of proportion
that led Pythagoras to reduce music to number. One day, as he passed a
black- smith’s shop, his ear was attracte d by the apparently regular
musical inter- vals of the sounds that came from the anvil. Finding that
the hammers were of different weights, he concluded that tones depend
upon numerical ratios. In one of the few experiments which we hear of in
classical science, he took two strings of equal thickness and equal
tension, and discovered that if one was twice as long as the other they
sounded an octave when he plucked them; if one was half again the length
of the other they gave a fifth {do, sol ) ; if one was a third longer
than the other they gave a fourth (do, fa) in this way every musical
interval could be mathematically calculated and expressed. Since all
bodies moving in space produce sounds, whose pitch depends upon the size
and speed of the body, then each planet in its orbit about the earth
(argued Pythagoras) makes a sound proportioned to its rapidity of
translation, which in turn rises with its distance from the earth; and
these diverse notes constitute a harmony or “music of the spheres,”
which we never hear because we hear it all the time.”</p>
<p>The universe, said Pythagoras, is a living sphere, whose center is
the earth. The earth too is a sphere, revolving, like the planets, from
west to east. The earth, indeed the whole universe, is divided into five
zones — arctic, antarctic, summer, winter, and equatorial. More or less
of the moon is visible to us according to the degree in which that half
of it which is facing the sun is also turned toward the earth. Eclipses
of the moon are caused by the interposition of the earth, or some other
body, between the moon and the sun.“ Pythagoras, says Diogenes Laertius,
“was the first person to call the earth round, and to give the name of
kosmos to the world.””</p>
<p>Having with these contributions to mathematics and astronomy done
more than any other man to establish science in Europe, Pythagoras pro-
ceeded to philosophy. The very word is apparently one of his creations.
He rejected the term sophia, or wisdom, as pretentious, and described
his own pursuit of understanding as philosophia — the love of wisdom.”
In the sixth century philosopher and Fythagorean were synonyms.“ Whereas
Thales and the other Milesians had sought the first principle of all
things</p>
<p>CHAP, vn) THE GREEKS IN THE WEST 165</p>
<p>in matter, Pythagoras sought it in form. Having discovered
numerically regular relations and sequences in music, and having
postulated them in the planets, he made the philosopher’s leap at unity
by announcing that such numerically regular relations and sequences
existed everywhere, and that the essential factor in everything was
number. Just as Spinoza would argue* that there were two worlds — one
the people’s world of things perceived by sense, the other the
philosopher’s world of laws and constan cies per- ceived by reason — and
that only the second world was permanently real; so Pythagoras felt that
the only basic and lasting aspects df anything were the numerical
relationships of its parts, t Perhaps health was a proper mathe- matical
relationship, or proportion, in the parts or elements of the body.
Perhaps even the soul was number.</p>
<p>At this point the mysticism in Pythagoras, nurtured in Egypt and the
Near East, disported itself freely. The soul, he believed, is divided
into three parts: feeling, intuition, and reason. Feeling is centered in
the heart, intuition and reason in the brain. Feeling and intuition
belong to animals as well as men;$ reason belongs to man alone, and is
immortal.“ After death the soul undergoes a period of purgation in
Hades; then it returns to earth and enters a new body in a chain of
transmigration that can be ended only by a completely virtuous life.
Pythagoras amused, or perhaps edified, his followers by telling them
that he had been in one incarnation a courtesan, in another the hero
Euphorbus; he could remember quite distinctly his adven- tures at the
siege of Troy, and recognized, in a temple at Argos, the armor that he
had worn in that ancient life.“ Hearing the yelp of a beaten dog, he
went at once to the rescue of the animal, saying that he distinguished
in its cries the voice of a dead friend.“ We catch again a glimpse of
the trade in ideas that bound sixth-century Greece, Africa, and Asia
when we reflect that this idea of metempsychosis was at one and fhe same
time capturing the imagination of India, of the Orphic cult in Greece,
and of a philo- sophical school in Italy.</p>
<p>We feel the hot breath of Hindu pessimism mingling, in the ethics of
• In the fragment “On the Improvement of the Intellect.”</p>
<p>t Science tries to reduce all phenomena to quantitative,
mathematical, verifiable statements; chemistry describes all things in
terms of symbols and figures, arranges the elements mathe- matically in
a periodic law, and reduces them to an intra-atomic arithmetic of
electrons; astronomy becomes celestial mathematics, and physicists seek
a mathematical formula to cover the phenomena of electricity, magnetism,
and gravitation; some thinkers of our time have tried to express
philosophy itself in mathematical form.</p>
<p>t We should note, in passing, that Pythagoras, slightly anticipating
Pasteur, denied spon-^ taneous generation, and taught that all anim^ are
bom from other animals throi^h “seeds.”“</p>
<p>i66</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>Pythagoras, with the clear, bright air of Plato. The purpose of life
in the Pythagorean system is to gain release from reincarnation; the
method is through virtue; and virtue is a harmony of the soul within
itself and with God. Sometimes this harmony can be artificially induced,
and the Pytha- goreans, like Greek priests and doctors, used music to
heal nervous disorders. More often harmony comes to the soul through
wisdom, a quiet under- standing of underlying truths; for such wisdom
teaches a man modesty, measure, and the golden mean. The opposite way —
the way of discord, ex- cess, and sin — leads by inevitable fate to
tragedy and punishment; justice is a “square number,” and sooner or
later every wrong will be “squared” with an equivalent penalty.“ Here in
germ are the moral philosophies of Plato and Aristotle.</p>
<p>Pythagorean politics is Plato’s philosophy realized before its
conception. According to the common tradition of antiquity the school of
Pythagoras was a communistic aristocracy: men and women pooling their
goods, edu- cated together, trained to virtue and high thinking by
mathematics, music, and philosophy, and offering themselves as the
guardian rulers of the state. Indeed it was Pythagoras’ effort to make
his society the actual government of his city that brought ruin upon
himself and his followers. The initiates entered so actively into
politics, and took so decidedly the aristocratic side, that the
democratic or popular party of Crotona, in an ecstasy of rage, burned
down the house in which the Pythagoreans were gathered, killed several
of them, and drove the rest out of the city. Pythagoras himself, in one
account, was captured and slain when, in his flight, he refused to tread
upon a field of beans; another story lets him escape to Metapontum,
where he abstained from food for forty days and — perhaps feeling that
eighty years were enough — starved himself to death.“</p>
<p>His influence was lasting; even today he is a potent name. His
society survived for three centuries in scattered groups throughout
Greece, pro- ducing scientists like Philolaus of Thebes and statesmen
like Archytas, dictator of Taras and friend of Plato. Wordsworth, in his
most famous ode, was an unconscious Pythagorean. Plato himself was
enthralled by the vague figure of Pythagoras. At every turn he takes
from him — in his scorn of democracy, his yearning for a communistic
aristocracy of philosopher- rulers, his conception of virtue as harmony,
his theories of the nature and destiny of the soul, his love of
geometry, and his addiction to the mysticism of number. All in all,
Pythagoras was the founder, so far as we know them, of both science and
philosophy in Europe — an achievement suflScient for any man.</p>

<p>West of Crotona lies the site of ancient Locri. The colony was
founded, says Aristotle, by runaway slaves, adulterers, and thieves from
Locris in main- land Greece; but perhaps Aristotle had an Old World
disdain for the New. Su£Fering disorder from the defects of their
qualities, the colonists applied to die orade at Delphi for advice, and
were told to get themselves laws. Pos- sibly Zaleucus had instructed the
oracle, for about 664 he gave to Locri ordinances which, as he said,
Athena had dictated to him in a dream. This was the first written code
of laws in the history of Greece, though not the first to be handed down
by the gods. The Locrians liked it so well that they required any man
who wished to propose a new law to speak with a rope around his neck, so
that, if his motion failed, he might be hanged with a minimum of public
inconvenience.**’</p>

and known to the Romans as Rhegium. Slipping through the Straits of
Messina — probably the “Scylla and Charybdis” of the Odyssey— one comes
to where Laus stood; and then to ancient Hyele, the Roman Velia, known
to history as Elea because Plato wrote it so, and because only its
philosophers are remembered. There Xenophanes of Colophon came about
510, and founded the Eleatic SchooL</p>
<p>He was a personality as unique as his favorite foe, Pythagoras. A man
of dauntless energy and reckless initiative, he wandered for sixty-seven
years, he tells US,“ “up and down the land of Hellas,” making
observations and enemies everywhere. He wrote and recited philosophical
poems, denounced Homer for his impious ribaldry, laughed at
superstition, found a port in Elea, and obstinately completed a century
before he died.“ Homer and Hesiod, sang Xenophanes, “have ascribed to
the gods all deeds that are a shame and a dis - grace among men —
thieving, adultery, and fraud.”“ But he himself was not a pillar of
orAodoxy.</p>
<p>There never was, nor ever will be, any man who knows with cer-</p>
<p>tainty the things about the gods. . . . Mortals fancy that gods are
bom, and wear clothes, and have voice and form like themselves. Yet
if</p>
<p>oxen and lions had hands, and could paint and fashion images as men
do, they would make the pictures and images of their gods in their</p>
<p>own likeness; horses would make them like horses, oxen like oxen.</p>
<p>Ethiopians make their gods black and snub-nosed; Thracians* give</p>
<p>• The Greeks were so fond of this fable that they told it also of the
laws of Catana and ThuriL The plan was especially pleasing to Michel de
Montaigne, and may not have outlived</p>
<p>its utility.</p>

<p>theirs blue eyes and red hair. . . . There is one god, supreme
among</p>
<p>gods and men; resembling mortals neither in form nor in mind. The</p>
<p>whole of him sees, the whole of him thinks, the whole of him hears.
Without toil he rules all things by the power of his mind.“</p>
<p>This god, says Diogenes Laertius,® was identified by Xenophanes with
the universe. All things, even men, taught the philosopher, are derived
from earth and water by natural laws,® Water once covered nearly all the
earth, for marine fossils are found far inland and on mountaintops; and
at some future time water will probably cover the whole earth again.®*
Nevertheless all change in history, and all separateness in things, are
superficial phenomena; beneath the flux and variety of forms is an
unchanging unity, which is the innermost reality of God.</p>
<p>From this starting point Xenophanes’ disciple, Parmenides of Elea,
proceeded</p>
<p>Twenty imles north of Elea lay the city of Poseidonia — the Roman
Paestum — founded by colonists from Sybaris as the main Italian terminus
of Milesian trade. Today one reaches it by a pleasant ride from Naples
through Salerno. Suddenly, by the roadside, amid a deserted field, three
temples appear, majes- tic even in their desolation. For the river, by
blocking its own mouth here with centuries of silt, has long since
turned this once healthy valley into a swamp, and even the reckless race
that tills the slopes of Vesuvius has fled in despair from these
malarial plains. Fragments of the ancient walls remain; but better
preserved, as if by solitude, are the shrines that the Greeks raised, in
modest limestone but almost perfect form, to the gods of the com and the
sea. The oldest of the buildings, lately called the “Basilica,” was more
likely a temple to Poseidon; men who owed their living to the fruit and
commerce of the Mediterranean dedicated it to him towards the middle of
this amazing sixth century b.c., which created great art, literature,
and philosophy from Italy to Shantung. The inner as weU as the outer
colonnades remain, and attest the colunmar passion of the Greeks. The
following generation built a smaller tem- ple, also Dorica lly simple
and strong; we call it the “temple of Ceres,” but we do not know what
god sniffed the savor of its offerings. A yet later generation, just
before or after the Persian War,® erected the greatest and
best-proportioned of the three temples, probably also to Poseidon —
fittingly enough, since from its porticoes one gazes into the inviting
face of the treacherous sea. Again almost everything is columns: a
powerful and complete Doric peristyle with-</p>

<p>out, and, within, a two-storied colonnade that once upheld a roof.
Here is one of the most impressive sights in Italy; it seems incredible
that this temple, better preserved than anything built by the Romans,
was the work of Greeks almost five centuries before Christ. We can
imagine something of the beauty and vitality of a community that had
both the resources and the taste to raise such centers for its religious
life; and then we can conjure up less inadequately the splendor of
richer and vaster cities like Miletus, Samos, Ephesus, Crotona, Sybaris,
and Syracuse.</p>
<p>Slightly north of where Naples stands today adventurers from Chalcis,
Ere- tria, Euboean Cyme, and Graia founded, about 750, the great port of
Cumae, oldest of Greek towns in the West. Taking the products of eastern
Greece and selling them in central Italy, Cumae rapidly acquired wealth,
colonized and controlled Rhegium, obtained command of the Straits of
Messina, and excluded from them, or subjected to heavy tolls, the
vessels of cities not leagued with it in trade.®* Spreading southward,
the Cumaeans founded Dicaearchia — which became the Roman port of
Puteoli (Pozzuoli) — and Neapolis, or New City, our Naples* From these
colonies Greek ideas as well as goods passed into the crude young city
of Rome, and northward into Etruria. At Cumae the Romans picked up
several Greek gods — Apollo and Heracles especially — and bought for
more than they were worth the scrolls in which the Cumaean Sibyl — the
aged priestess of Apollo — had foretold the future of Rome.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of the sixth century the Phocaeans of Ionia landed
on the southern shore of France, founded Massalia (Marseilles), and
carried Greek products up the Rhone and its branches as far as Arles and
Nimes. They made friends and wives of the natives, introduced the olive
and the vine as gifts to France, and so familiarized southern Gaul with
Greek civilization that Rome found it easy to spread its kindred culture
there in Caesar’s time. Ranging along the coast to the east, the
Phocaeans established Antipolis (Antibes), Nicaea (Nice), and Monoecus
(Monaco). Westward they ventured into Spain and built the towns of
Rhodae (Rosas), Emporium (Ampurias), Hemeroscopium, and Maenaca (near
Malaga). The Greeks in Spain flourished for a while by exploiting the
sflver mines of Tartessus; but in 535 the Carthaginians and Etruscans
combined their forces to destroy the Phocaean fleet, and from that time
Greek power in the western Mediterranean waned.</p>
<p>V. SICILY</p>
<p>We have left not quite to the last the richest of all the regions
colonized by the Greeks. To Sicily nature had given what she had
withheld from continental Greece — an apparently inexhaustible soil
fertilized by rain and</p>
<p>lyo THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>lava, and producing so much wheat and com that Sicily was thought to
be if not the birthplace at least a favorite haunt of Demeter herself.
Here were orchards, vineyards, olive groves, heavy with frait; honey as
succulent as Hymettus’, and flowers blooming in their turn from the
beginning to the end of the year. Grassy plains pastured sheep and
cattle, endless timber grew in the hills, and the fish in the
surrounding waters reproduced faster than Sicily could eat them.</p>
<p>A neolithic culture had flourished here in the third millennium
before Christ, a bronze culture in the second; even in Minoan days trade
had bound the island with Crete and Greece.“ Towards the end of the
second millen- nium three waves of immigration broke upon Sicilian
shores: the Sicans came from Spain, the Elymi from Asia Minor, the
Sicels from Italy.“ About 800 the Phoenicians established themselves at
Motya and Panormus (Paler- mo) in the west. From 735 on* the Greeks
poured in, and in quick succes- sion founded Naxos, Syracuse, Leoritini,
Messana (Messina), (Tatana, Gela, Himera, Selinus, and Acragas. In all
these cases the natives were driven from the coast by force of arms.
Most of them retired to till the mountain- ous interior, some became
slaves to the invaders, so many others inter- married with the
conquerors that Greek blood, character, and morals in Sicily took on a
perceptible native tint of passion and sensuality.“ The Hellenes never
quite conquered the island; the Phoenicians and Carthagin- ians remained
predominant on the west coast, and for five hundred years periodic war
marked the struggle of Greek and Semite, Europe and Africa, for the
possession of Sicily. After thirteen centuries of domination by Rome
that contest would be resumed, in the Middle Ages, between Norman and
Saracen.</p>
<p>Catana was distinguished for its laws, the Lipari Islands for their
communism, Himera for its poet, Segesta, Selinus, and Acragas for their
temples, Syracuse for its power and wealth. The laws that Charondas gave
to Catana, a full gen- eration before Solon, became a model for many
cities in Sicily and Italy, and served to create public order and sexual
morality in communities unprotected by ancient mores and sacred
precedents. A man might divorce his wife, or a wife her husband, said
Charondas, but then he or she must not marry anyone younger than the
divorced mate.“ Charondas, according to a typically Greek tale, forbade
the citizens to enter the assembly while armed. One day, how- ever, he
himself came to the public meeting forgetfully wearing his sword. When a
voter reproached him for breaking his own law he answered, “I will
rather confirm it,” and slew himself.”</p>

<p>CHAP.Vn) THE GREEKS IN THE WEST I7I</p>
<p>If we wish to visualize the difficulties of life in colonies carved
out by violent conquest we need only contemplate the curious communism
of the Lipari — i.e., the Glorious — Islands, which lie to the north of
eastern Sicily. Here, about 580, some adventurers from Cnidus organized
a pirate’s paradise. Preying upon the commerce about the Straits, they
brought the booty to their island lairs and shared it with exemplary
equality. The land was owned by the com- munity, a part of the
population was assigned to till it, and the products were distributed in
like shares to all the citizens. In time, however, individualism
reasserted itself: the land was divided into plots individually owned,
and life resumed the uneven tenor of its competitive way.</p>
<p>On the northern coast of Sicily lay Himera, destined to be the
Plataea of the West. There Stesichorus, “Maker of Choruses,” at a time
when the Greeks were tiring of epics, recast into the form of choral
lyrics the legends of the race, and gave even to Helen and Ac hilles the
passing novelty of “modem dress.” As if to bridge the gap between the
dying epic and the future novel, Stesichorus composed love stories in
verse; in one of these a pure and timid lass dies of unrequited love, in
the style of Provencal madrigals or Victorian fiction. At the same time
he opened a pathway for Theocritus by writing a pastoral poem on the
death of the shepherd Daphnis, whose love for Chloe was to be the main
business of the Greek novel in the Roman age. Stesichorus had his own
romance, and with no less a lady than Helen herself. Having lost his
sight, he attributed this calamity to his having handed down the tale of
Helen’s infidelity; to atone to her (for she was now a goddess) he
composed a “pal - inode,” or second song, as suring the world that Helen
had been kidnaped by force, had never yielded to Paris, had never gone
to Troy, but had waited intact in Egypt until Menelaus came to rescue
her. In his old age the poet warned Himera against giving dictatorial
power to Phalaris of Acragas.* Being unheeded, he moved to Catana, where
his monumental tomb was one of the sights of Roman Sicily.</p>
<p>West of Himera lay Segesta, of which nothing remains but a peristyle
of unfinished Doric columns weirdly rising amid surrounding weeds. To
find Sicilian architecture at its best we must cross the island
southward to the once great cities of Selinus and Acragas. During its
tragic tenure of life from its establishment in 651 to its destruction
by Carthaginians in 409, Selinus raised to the silent gods seven Doric
temples, immense in size but of imperfect work- manship, covered with
painted plaster and decorated with crude reliefs. The demon of
earthquake destroyed these temples at a date unknown, and little
survives of them but broken columns and capitals sprawling on the
ground.</p>
<p>• He cast his warning into the form of a fable. A horse, annoyed by
the invasion of a stag into its pasturage, asked a man to help it punish
the poacher. The man promised to do this if the horse would allow him to
bestride it javelin in hand. The horse agreed, the stag was frightened
away, and the horse found that he was now a slave to the man.</p>
<p>172 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. VH</p>
<p>Acragas, the Roman Agrigentum, was in the sixth century the largest
and richest city in Sicily. We picture it rising from its busy wharves
through a noisy market place to the homes on the slope of the hill, and
the stately acrop- olis whose shrines almost lifted their worshipers to
the sky. Here, as in most of the Greek colonies, the landowning
aristocracy yielded power to a dictator- ship representing chiefly the
middle class. In 570 Phalaris seized the government, and secured
immortality by roasting his enemies in a brazen bull; he was par-
ticularly pleased by a contrivance that made the agonized cries of his
victims sound Arough a mechanism of pipes like the bellowing of the
animal.“ Never- theless it was to him and a later dictator, Theron, that
the city owed the politi- cal order and stability that permitted its
economic development. The mer- chants of Acragas, like those of Selinus,
Crotona, and Sybaris, became the American millionaires of their time,
upon whom the lesser plutocrats of older Greece looked with secret envy
and compensatory scorn; the new world, said the old, was interested in
size and show, but had no taste or artistry. TTie temple of Zeus at
Acragas unquestionably sought size, for Polybius describes it as “second
to none in Greece in dimensions and design”;“ we cannot directly judge
its beauty, for wars and earthquakes destroyed it. A generation later,
in the age of Pericles, Acragas raised more modest structures. One of
them, the temple of Concord, survives almost completely, and of the
temple of Hera there remains an impressive colonnade; enough in either
case to show that Greek taste was not confined to Athens, and that even
the commercial west had learned that “size is not development.”— In
Acragas the great Empedocles would be bom; and perhaps it was there, and
not in Etna’s crate r, that he would die.</p>
<p>Syracuse began as it is today — a village huddled on the promontory
of Ortygia. As far back as the eighth century Corinth had sent
colonists, armed with righteousness and superior weapons, to seize the
little peninsula, which was then perhaps an island. They built or
widened the connection with the mainland of Sicily, and drove most of
the Sicels into the interior. They multiplied with all the rapidity of a
vigorous people on a resource-full soil; in time their city became the
largest in Greece, with a circumference of fourteen miles and a
population of half a million souls. An aristocracy of landholders was
overthrown about 495 by a revolt of the unfranchised plebs in alliance
with the enslaved Sicels. The new democracy, if we may believe
Aristotle,®* proved incapable of establishing an orderly society, and in
485 Gelon of Gela, by a program of enlightened treachery, set up a
dictatorship. Like many of his kind he was as able as he was
unscrupulous. Scorning all moral codes and political restraints, he
transformed Ortygia into an im- pregnable fortress for his government,
conquered Naxos, Leontini, and</p>
<p>THE GREEKS IN THE WEST</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>*73</p>
<p>Messana, and taxed all eastern Sicily to make Syracuse the most
beautiful of Greek capitals. ’’In this way,” says Herodotus, sadly,
“Gelon became a great king.”*“®</p>
<p>He redeemed himself, and became the idolized Napoleon of Sicily when,
as Xerxes’ fleet moved upon Athens, the Carthaginians sent an armada
only less numerous than the Persian to wrest the island paradise from
the Greeks, The fate of Sicily was joined with that of Greece when in
the same month- tradition said on the same day — Gelon faced Hamilcar at
Himera, and Themistocles confronted Xerxes at Salamis.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE GREEKS IN AFRICA</li>
</ol>
<p>The Carthaginians had reason to be disturbed, for even on the north
coast of Africa the Greeks had established cities and were capturing
trade. As early as 630 the Dorians of Thera had sent a numerous colony
to Cyrene, midway between Carthage and Egypt. There, on the desert’s
edge, they found good soil, with rain so abundant that the natives spoke
of the site as the place where there was a hole in the sky. The Greeks
used part of the land for pas- turage, and exported wool and hides; they
grew from the silphium plant a spice that all Greece was eager to buy;
they sold Greek products to Africa, and developed their own handicrafts
to such a point that Cyrenaic vases ranked among the best. The city used
its wealth intelligently, and adorned itself with great gardens,
temples, statuary, and gymnasiums. Here the first famous epi- curean
philosopher, Aristippus, was bom, and here, after much wandering, he
returned to found the Cyrenaic School.</p>
<p>Within Egypt itself, normally hostile to any foreign settlement, the
Greeks gained a foothold, at last an empire. About 650 the Milesians
opened a “factory,” or trading post, at Naucratis on the Canopic branch
of the Nile. Pharaoh Psam- tik I tolerated them because they made good
mercenaries, while their commerce provided rich prey for his collectors
of customs revenues.*” Ahmose II gave them a large measure of
self-government. Naucratis became almost an indus- trial city, with
manufactures of pottery, terra cotta, and faience; still more it became
an emporium of trade, bringing in Greek oil and wine, and sending out
Egyptian wheat, linen, and wool, African ivory, frankincense, and gold.
Gradually, amid these exchanges, Egyptian lore and techniques in
religion,</p>
<p>• “Gelon of Syracuse,” says Lucian, “had disagreeable breath, but did
not find it out him - self for a long time, no one venturing to mention
such a circumstance to a tyrant. At last a foreign woman who had a
connection with him dared to tell him; whereupon he went to his wife and
scolded her for never having, with all her opportunities of knowing,
warned him of it; she put in the defense that as she had never been
familiar or at close quarters with any other man, she had supposed all
men were like that.”®® He was disa rmed.</p>

<p>architecture, sculpture, and science flowed into Greece, while in
return Greek words and ways entered Egypt, and paved the way for Greek
domination in the Alexandrian age.</p>
<p>If in imagination we take a merchant vessel from Naucratis to Athens,
our tour of the Greek world will be complete. It was necessary that we
should make this long circuit in order that we might see and feel the
extent and variety of Hellenic civilization. Aristotle described the
constitutional history of 158 Greek city-states, but there were a
thousand more. Each con- tributed in commerce, industry, and thought to
what we mean by Greece. In the colonies, rather than on the mainland,
were bom Greek poetry and prose, mathematics and metaphysics, oratory
and history. Without them, and the thousand absorbing tentacles which
they stretched out into the old world, Greek civilization, the most
precious product in history, might never have been. Through them the
cultures of Egypt and the Orient passed into Greece, and Greek culture
spread slowly into Asia, Africa, and Europe.</p>
