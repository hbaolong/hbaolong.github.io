<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>The Suicide of Greece</p>
<p>I. THE GREEK WORLD IN THE AGE OF PERICLES</p>
<p>1 ET us, before facing the melancholy spectacle of the Peloponnesian
War, j glance at the Greek world outside of Attica. Our knowledge of
these other states in this period is so fragmentary that we are left to
assume — what we cannot prove — that they shared to a minor degree in
the cultural blossoming of the Golden Age.</p>
<p>In 459 Pericles, anxious to control Egyptian grain, sent a great
fleet to expel the Persians from Egypt. The expedition failed, and
thereafter Pericles adopted the policy of Themistocles — to win the
world by commerce rather than by war. Throughout the fifth century Egypt
and Cyprus continued under Per- sian rule. Rhodes remained free, and the
merger of its three cities into one in 408 prepared it to become in the
Hellenistic period one of the richest commer- cial centers in the
Mediterranean. The Greek cities of Asia preserved their independence,
won at Mycale in 479, until the destruction of the Athenian Empire left
them helpless again before the tribute collectors of the Great King. The
Greek colonies in Thrace and on the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the
Euxine prospered under Athenian domination, but were impoverished by the
Peloponnesian War. Under Archelaus Macedonia passed out of barbarism and
became one of the powers of the Greek world: good roads were laid down,
a disciplined army was formed out of the hardy mountaineers, a handsome
new capital was buUt at Pella, and many Greek geniuses, like Timotheus,
Zeuxis, and Euripides, found welcome at the court. Boeotia in this
period produced Pindar, and gave to Greece, in the Boeotian Confederacy,
an unappreciated example of how independent states might live in peace
and co-operation.</p>
<p>In Italy the Greek cities suffered from frequent wars, and from
Athenian ascendancy in maritime trade. In 443 Pericles sent out a group
of Hellenes, gathered from different states, to establish near the site
of Sybaris the new col- ony of Thurii, as an experiment in Panhellenic
unity. Protagoras drew up a code of laws for the city, and Hippodamus
the architect laid out the streets on a rectangular plan that was to be
widely imitated in the following centuries. Within a few years the
colonists divided into factions according to their origin, and most of
the Athenians, probably including Herodotus, went back to Athens.</p>
<p>438 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XYIH</p>
<p>Sicily, always turbulent but always fertile, continued to grow in
wealth and culture. Selinus and Acragas built massive temples; and under
Theron Acragas became so rich that Empedocles remarked: “The men of
Acragas devote them - selves wholly to luxury as if they were to die
tomorrow, but they furnish their houses as if they were to live
forever.”^ Gelon I, when he died in 478, left Syracuse a system of
administration almost as effective as that which Napoleon bequeathed to
modern France. Under his brother and successor, Hieron I, the city
became a center not only of trade and wealth, but of literature,
science, and art. There, too, luxury reached dizzy heights: Syracusan
banquets became a byword for extravagance, and “Corinthian girls” were
so numerous in the city that any man who slept at home was considered a
saint.** The citizens were quick of mind and sharp of tongue; they
enjoyed good oratory to their ruin, and crowded to hear, in their
magnificent open-air theater, the comedies of Epicharmus and the
tragedies of Aeschylus.* Hieron was a tyrant of bad temper and good
will, cruel to his enemies and generous to his friends. He opened his
court and purse to Simonides, Bacchylides, Pindar, and Aeschylus, and
with their help made Syracuse for a moment the intellectual capital of
Greece.</p>
<p>But man cannot live on art alone. The Syracusans thirsted for the
wine of freedom, and after the death of Hieron they deposed his brother
and set up a limited democracy. The other Greek cities in the island
took courage and likewise expelled their dictators; the trading classes
overthrew the landowning aristocracies, and established a commercial
democracy superimposed upon a system of ruthless slavery. After some
sixty years, war ended this interlude of liberty as it had ended another
through Gelon I. In 409 the Carthaginians, who had kept alive through
three generations the memory of Hamilcar’s defeat at Himera, invaded
Sicily with an armada of fifteen hundred ships and twenty thousand men
under Hamilcar’s grandson, Hannibal. He laid siege to Selinus, which had
become pacific under prosperity, and had neglected to keep its defenses
in repair. The surprised city appealed for help to Acragas and Syra-
cuse, whose comfortable citizens responded with Spartan leisureliness.
Selinus was taken, all the survivors were massacred and mutilated, and
the city became a part of the Carthaginian Empire. Hannibal proceeded to
Himera, captured it with ease, and put three thousand prisoners to
torture and death to appease the shade of his grandfather. A plague
decimated his troops and took off Hanni- bal himself as they besieged
Acragas, but his successor mollified the gods of Carthage by burning
alive his own son as an offering. The Carthaginians took the city, took
Gela and Camarina, and marched on toward Syracuse. The terrified
Syracusans, interrupted in their banquets, gave absolute power to their
ablest</p>
<p>•The theater was probably built under Hieron I (478 -67), and rebuilt
under Hieron II (270-16). Much of it survives; and many ancient Greek
dramas have been staged in it in our century.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVm) THE SUICIDE OF GREECE 439</p>
<p>general, Dionysius. But Dionysius made peace with the Carthaginians,
ceded to them all southern Sicily, and used his troops to establish a
second dictator- ship (405). It was not all treachery. Dionysius knew
that resistance was use- less; he surrendered everything but his army
and his city, and resolved to strengthen both until he too, like Gelon,
could expel the invaders from Sicily.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>HOW THE GREAT WAR BEGAN</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as the simple soul must picture deity in the form of a man, so
the simple citizen must conceive the causes of war to be personal —
usually one person. Even Aristophanes, like some gossips of his time,
would have it that Pericles brought on the Peloponnesian War by
attacking Megara, because Megara had offended Aspasia.*</p>
<p>It is probable that Pericles, who had not hesitated to conquer
Aegina, had dreamed of completing Athens’ control of Greek trade by
domin ating not only Megara but Corinth, which was to Greece what
Istanbul is to the eastern Mediterranean today — a door and a key to
half a continent’s trade. But the basic cause of the war was the growth
of the Athenian Empire, and the development of Athenian control over the
commercial and political life of the Aegean. Athens allowed free trade
there in time of peace, but only by imperial sufferance; no vessel might
sail that sea without her consent. Athenian agents decided the
destination of every vessel that left the grain ports of the north;
Methone, starving with drought, had to ask Athens’ leave to import a
little corn.* Athens defended this domination as a vital necessity; she
was dependent upon imported food, and was deter- mined to guard the
routes by which that food came. In policing the ave- nues of
international trade Athens performed a real service to peace and
prosperity in the Aegean, but the process became more and more irksome
as the pride and wealth of the subject cities grew. The funds that these
had contributed for defense against Persia were being used for the
adorn- ment of Athens, even for the financing of Athenian wars upon
other Greeks.* Periodically the assessment had been increased until it
was now, in 432, some 460 talents (,300,000) per year. Athens reserved
to Athe- nian courts the right to try all cases, arising within the
Confederacy, that involved Athenian citizens or major crimes. If any
city resisted, it was reduced by force; so Pericles with efficient
dispatch suppressed rebellions in Aegina (457), Euboea (446), and Samos
(440). If we may believe</p>
<p>Thucydides, the democratic leaders at Athens, while making liberty
the idol of their policy among Athenians, frankly recognized that the
Con-</p>
<p>440 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.XVm</p>
<p>federacy of free cities had become an empire of force. “You should re
- member,” says Thucydides’ Cleon to the Assembly (427), “that your</p>
<p>empire is a despotism exercised over unwilling subjects who are
always con- spiring against you; they do not obey in return for any
kindness which you do them to your own injury, but only in so far as you
are their master; they have no love for you, but they are held down by
force.”’ The inherent contradiction between the worship of liberty and
the despotism of empire co-operated with the individualism of the Greek
states to end the Golden Age.</p>
<p>The resistance to Athenian policy came from nearly every state in</p>
<p>Greece.’ Boeotia fought off at Coronea (447) the attempt of Athens to
include it in the Empire. Some subject cities, and others that feared to
become subject, appealed to Sparta to check the Athenian power. The
Spartans were not eager for war, knowing the strength and valor of the
Athenian fleet; but the old racial antipathy between Dorian and Ionian
inflamed them, and the Athenian custom of establishing in every city
democracies dependent upon the Empire seemed to the landowning oli-
garchy of Sparta a threat to aristocratic government everywhere. For a
time the Spartans contented themselves with supporting the upper classes
in every city, and slowly forging a united front against Athens.</p>
<p>Surrounded by enemies abroad and at home, Pericles worked for peace
and prepared for war. The army, he calculated, could protect Attica, or
a ll of Attica’s population gathered within Athens’ walls; and the navy
could keep open the routes by which Euxine or Egyptian grain might enter
Athens’ walled port. It was his judgment that no real concessions could
be made without endangering that supply of food; it seemed to him, as
now to England, a choice between empire and starvation. Nevertheless he
sent envoys to all the Greek states, inviting them to an Hellenic Con-
ference which would seek a peaceful solution of the problems that were
leading to war. Sparta refused to attend, feeling that her acceptance
would be construed as an acknowledgment of Athenian hegemony, and at her
secret suggestion’ so many other states rejected the invitation that the
project fell through. Meanwhile, says Thucydides, in a sentence that ex-
plains much history, “The Peloponnesus and Athens were both full of
young men whose inexperience made them eager to take up arms.’”</p>
<p>These basic factors being present, the coming of war awaited some</p>
<p>provocative incident. In 435 Corcyra, a Corinthian colony, declared
itself independent of Corinth; and presently she joined the Athenian
Confeder- acy for protection. Corinth sent a fleet to reduce the island;
Athens, ap-</p>
<p>THE SUICIDE OF GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP, xvin)</p>
<p>441</p>
<p>pealed to by the victorious democrats of Corcyra, sent a fleet to
help them. An indecisive battle took place, in which the navies of
Corcyra and Athens fought against those of Megara and Corinth. In 432
Potidaea, a city in Chalcidice tributary to Athens but Corinthian in
blood, attempted to expel the Athenian power. Pericles sent an army to
besiege it, but its resistance continued for two years, and weakened the
military resources and prestige of Athens. When Megara gave further help
to Corinth Pericles ordered all Megarian products excluded from the
markets of Attica and the Empire. Megara and Corinth appealed to Sparta;
Sparta proposed to Athens a repeal of this Megarian decree; Pericles
agreed on condition that Sparta permit foreign states to trade with
Laconia. Sparta refused; instead, she laid down as a prerequisite to
peace, that Athens should acknowledge the full inde- pendence of all
Greek cities — i.e., that Athens should surrender her Em- pire. Pericles
persuaded the Athenians to reject this demand; and Sparta declared
war.“</p>
<p>ra. FROM THE PLAGUE TO THE PEACE</p>
<p>Nearly all Greece ranged itself on one or the other side. Every state
in the Pelopoimesus except Argos supported Sparta; so did Corinth,
Megara, Boeotia, Locris, and Phocis. Athens, at the outset, had the
half-hearted help of the Ionian and Euxine cities and the Aegean isles.
Like the World War of our own time, the first phase of the struggle was
a contest between sea power and land power. The Athenian fleet laid
waste the coastal towns of the Peloponnesus, while the Spartan army
invaded Attica, seized the crops, and ruined the soil. Pericles called
the population of Attica within the walls of Athens, refused to let his
troops go out to battle, and advised the excited Athenians to bide their
time and wait for their navy to win the war.</p>
<p>His calculations were strategically sound, but they ignored a factor
that almost decided the conflict. The crowding of Athens led (430) to a
plague —probably malaria”— which raged for nearly three years, killing a
fourth of the soldiers and a great number of the civilian population.*
The people, desperate with the combined sufferings of epidemic and war,
accused Peri- cles of responsibility for both. Cleon and others indicted
him on the charge of misusing public funds; since he had apparently
employed state money to bribe the Spartan kings to peace, he was unable
to give a satis- factory accounting; he was convicted, deposed from
ofiice, and fined the</p>
<p>• Cf. Lucretius’ powerful descript ion of this plague in De Rerum
Natural vi, 1138-1286.</p>
<p>442 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVIH</p>
<p>enormous sum of fifty talents (00,000). About the same time (429) his
sister and his two legitimate sons died of the plague. The Athenians,
find- ing no leader to replace him, recalled him to power (429); and, to
show their esteem for him, and their sympathy in his bereavement, they
over- rode a law that he himself had passed, and bestowed citizenship
upon the son that ^spasia had borne to him. But the aging statesman had
himself been infected by the plague; he grew weaker day by day, and died
within a few months after his restoration to ofiice. Under him Athens
had reached her zenith; but because that height had been attained in
part through the wealth of an unwilling Confederacy, and through a power
that invited almost universal hostility, the Golden Age was unsound in
its foundations, and was doomed to disaster when Athenian statesmanship
failed in the strategy of peace.</p>
<p>Perhaps, as Thucydides suggests, Athens might have come through to
victory nevertheless, if it had pursued to the end the Fabian policy
laid down by Pericles. But his successors were too impatient to carry
out a program that required a proud self-control. The new masters of the
demo- cratic party were merchants like Cleon the dealer in leather,
Eucrates the rope seller. Hyperbolus the lampmaker; and these men
demanded an active war on land as well as sea. Cleon was the ablest of
them, the most elo- quent, unscrupulous, and c orrupt. Plutarch
describes him as “the first ora - tor among the Athenians that pulled
off his cloak and smote his thigh when addressing the people”;“ Cleon
made it a point, says Aristotle, to appear on the rostrum in the garb of
a workingman.“ He was the first in a long line of demagogues that ruled
Athens from the death of Pericles to the loss of Athenian independence
at Chaeronea (338).</p>
<p>Cleon’s ability was proved in 425 when the Athenian fleet besieged a
Spartan army on the island of Sphacteria, near Messenian Pylus. No
admiral seemed capable of taking the stronghold; but when the Assembly
gave Cleon charge of the siege (half hoping that he would be killed in
action), he surprised all by carrying through the attack with a skill
and courage that forced the Lacedaemonians to an unprecedented
surrender. Sparta, humbled, offered peace and alliance in return for the
captured men, but Cleon’s oratory persuaded the Assembly to reject the
offer and con - tinue the war. His hold on the populace was strengthened
by a proposal, easily carried, that the Athenians should henceforth pay
no taxes to the support of the war, but should finance it by raising the
tribute exacted of the subject cities in the Empire (424). In these
cities, as in Athens, the policy of Cleon was to get as much money out
of the rich as he could find.</p>
<p>THE SUICIDE OF GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP, xvra)</p>
<p>443</p>
<p>When the upper classes of Mytilene rebelled, overthrew the democracy,
and declared Lesbos free of allegiance to Athens (429), Cleon moved that
all adult males in the disaffected city be put to death. The Assembly —
perhaps a mere quorum — agreed, and sent a ship with orders to that
effect to Paches, the Athenian general who had put down the revolt. When
word of the ruthless edict got about Athens the steadier heads called
for another meeting of the Assembly, secured the repeal of the decree,
and dispatched a second ship which reached Paches just in time to
prevent a massacre. Paches sent to Athens a thousand ringleaders, who,
at Cl eon’s suggestion, and in accordance with the custom of the age,
were all put to death.”</p>
<p>Cleon redeemed himself by dying in battle against the Spartan hero
Brasidas, who was capturing one after another of the cities subject or
allied to Athens in the mainland north. It was in this campaign that
Thucydides lost his naval commission and his Athenian residence by
coming up too tardily to the relief of Amphipolis, which commanded the
gold mines of Thrace. Brasidas having died in the same campaign, Sparta,
left leaderless in the face of a threatened Helot revolt, offered peace
again; and Athens, for once taking the advice of the oligarchic leader,
signed the Peace of Nicias (421). The rival cities not only declared the
war ended, but signed an alliance for fifty years; and Athens committed
herself to go to the help of Sparta should the Helots rise.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ALCIBIADES</li>
</ol>
<p>Three factors turned this pledge of a half century of friendship into
a brief truce of six years: the diplomatic corruption of the pe ace into
“war by other means”; the rise of Alcibiades as the leader of a faction
that favored renewed hostilities; and the attempt of Athens to conquer
the Dqrian colonies in Sicily. Sparta’s allies refused to sign the
agreement; they fell away from Sparta as now a weakened state, and
transferred their alliance to Athens. Alcibiades, while keeping Athens
formally at peace, maneuvered them into a war with Sparta, and united
them in battle against her at Mantinea (418). Sparta won, and Greece
relapsed into an angry truce.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Athens sent a fleet to the Dorian isle of Melos to demand
its entrance as a subject state into the Athenian Empire (416).
According to Thucydides, who here probably sinks the historian into the
sophistical philosopher or the revengeful exile, the Athenian envoys
gave no other</p>
<p>444 the life of Greece (chap.xvhi</p>
<p>reason for their action than that m^ht is right. “Of the gods we
believe, and of men we know, that by a necessary law of their nature
they rule wherever they can. And it is not as if we were the first to
make this</p>
<p>law, or to act upon it; we found it existing before, and shall leave
it to exist forever after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing
that you and everybody else, havir^ the same power as we have, would do
the same as we do.’”” The Melians refused to yield, and announced that
they would put their trust in the gods. Later, as irresistible
reinforcements came to the Athenian fleet, they surrendered at the
discretion of the conquerors. The Athenians put to death all adult males
who fell into their hands, sold the women and children as slaves, and
gave the island to five hundred Athenian colonists. Athens rejoiced in
the conquest, and prepared to illus- trate in a living tragedy the theme
of her dramatists, that a vengeful nemesis pursues all insolent
success.</p>
<p>Alcibiades was one of those who, in the Assembly, defended the reso-
lution condemning the male population of Melos to death.” His support
for any motion usually sufficed to carry it, for he was now the most
famous man in Athens, admired for his eloquence, his good looks, his
versatile genius, even his faults and crimes. His father, the rich
Cleinias, had been killed at the battle of Gironea; his mother, an
Alcmaeonid and near rela- tive of Pericles, had persuaded the statesman
to bring up Alcibiades in his home. The boy was troublesome, but
intelligent and brave; at twenty he fought beside Socrates at Potidaea,
and at twenty-six at Delium (424). The philosopher seems to have felt a
warm attachment for the youth, and called him to virtue, says Plutarch,
with words that “so overcame Alci - biades as to draw tears from his
eyes, and disturb his very soul. Yet some- times he would abandon
himself to flatterers, when they proposed to him varieties of pleasure,
and would desert Socrates, who would then pursue him as if he had been a
fugitive slave.””</p>
<p>The wit and pranks of the young man became the shocked and fas-</p>
<p>cinated gossip of Athens. When Pericles reproved his immodest dogma-
tism by saying that he too had talked cleverly in his youth, Alcibiades
answered, “Pity I couldn’t have known you when your brain was at its
best.”” Purely to meet the challenge of his fellow roisterers, he
publicly struck in the face one of Athe ns’ richest and most powerful
men, Hip - ponicus. The next morning he entered the house of the
frightened mag- nate, bared his body, and begged Hipponicus to scourge
him in punishment. The old man was so overwhelmed that he gave the youth
his daugh- ter Hipparete in marriage, with a dowry of ten talents;
Alcibiades per-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVlIl) THE SUICIDE OF GREECE 445</p>
<p>suaded him to double it, and spent most of it on himself. He lived on
a scale of luxury never known in Athens before. He filled his home with
costly furniture, and engaged artists to paint pictures on the walls. He
kept a stud of racing horses, and often won the chariot race at Olympia;
once his entries took the first, second, and fourth prizes in one
contest, whereupon he feasted the whole Assembly.® He fitted out
triremes, and paid the expenses of choruses; and when the state called
for war contribu- tors his donations topped all the rest. Free from any
inhibition of con- science, convention, or fear, he frolicked through
youth and early manhood with such animal spirits that all Athens seemed
to enjoy his happiness. He lisped a little, but with a charm that made
all fashionable young</p>
<p>men lisp; he wore a new cut of shoe, and soon all the gilded youth of
the city were- wearing “Alcibiades shoes.” He violated a hundred laws
and injured a hundred men, but no one dared bring him before a court.
His popularity with the hetairai was so general that he wore on his
golden shield an Eros with a thunderbolt, as if to announce his
victories in love.” His wife, after bearing his infidelities with
patience, returned to her father’s</p>
<p>Entering politics after the death of Pericles, he found only one
rival — the rich and pious Nicias. But Nicias favored the aristocracy,
and peace; therefore Alcibiades set himself to favor the commercial
classes, and preached an imperialism that touched Athenian pride; the
Peace of Nicias was sufficiently discredited in his eyes by bearing his
rival’s name. In 420 he was elected one of the ten generals, and began
those ambitious schemes that led Athens back into war. When the Assembly
acclaimed him Timon the misanthrope rejoiced, predicting great
calamities.”</p>
<p>V. THE SICILIAN ADVENTURE</p>
<p>It was the imagination of Alcibiades that ruined the work of
Pericles. Athens had recovered from the plague and the war, and trade
was again bringing her the wealth of the Aegean. But the law of every
being’ is self- development; no ambition, no empire, is ever content.
Alcibiades dreamed of carving out a new realm for Athens in the rich
cities of Italy and Sicily; there Athens would find grain, materials,
and men; there she would control</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>446</p>
<p>(chap, xvin</p>
<p>the foreign food supply of the Peloponnesus; there she might double
the tribute that was making her the greatest city in Greece. Only
Syracuse could rival her; and that was a thought hard for Athens to
bear. If she could take Syracuse all the western Mediterranean would
fall into her lap, and a splendor would come to Athens such as even
Pericles had not con- ceived.</p>
<p>In 427 Sicily, imitating the mainland, had divided into warring
camps, one led by Dorian Syracuse, the other by Ionian Leontini.
Leontini sent Gorgias to Athens to seek help, but Athens was then too
weak to respond. Now, in 416, Segesta dispatched envoys to Athens to say
that Syracuse was planning to subjugate all Sicily, make the island
Dorian in government, and supply food and money to Sparta should the
great war be renewed. Alcibiades leaped to his opportunity. He argued
that the Sicilian Greeks were hopelessly divided, even within each city;
that it would be a simple matter — given a little courage — to annex the
whole island to the Empire; that the Empire must continue to grow, or
begin to decay; and that a little war now and then was a necessary
training for an imperial race.” Nicias pled with the Assembly not to
listen to any man whose personal extrava- gance tempted him to wild
schemes of aggrandizement; but the eloquence of Alcibiades and the
imagination of a people now dangerously free from moral scruples won the
day. The Assembly declared war against Syra- cuse, voted funds for a
vast armada, and, as if to ensure defeat, divided the command between
Alcibiades and Nicias.</p>
<p>Preparations went on with the characteristic fever of war, and the
occa- sion of the fleet’s departure was awaited as a patriotic festival.
But shortly before this appointed day a strange occurrence shocked a
city that had lost much of its piety but none of its superstitions. Some
unknown per- sons, under cover of night, had knocked off the noses,
ears, and phalli from the figures of the god Hermes that stood before
public buildings and many private dwellings as an emblem of fertility
and a guardian of the home. An excited investigator brought forward the
unreliable evidence of aliens and slaves that the prank had been
perpetrated by a drunken party of Alci- biades’ friends, led by Alc
ibiades himself. The young general protested his innocence, and demanded
to be tried at once, that he might be con- victed or cleared before the
departure of the fleet; but his enemies, fore- seeing his acquittal,
succeeded in postponing the trial. And so in 415 the great flotilla set
sail, led by a timid pacifist who hated war, and by an audacious
militarist whose genius of leadership was frustrated by the di-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVin) THE SUICIDE OF GREECE 447</p>
<p>vided command, and the dread, among the crews, that he had incurred
the enmity of the gods.</p>
<p>The fleet had been gone some days when new evidence, as unreliable as
before, was brought out to the effect that Alcibiades and his friends
had participated in an impious mimicry of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
Urged on by an enraged populace, the Assembly sent the swift galley
Salaminia to overtake Alcibiades and bring him back for trial.
Alcibiades accepted the summons and went aboard the Salaminia; but when
the vessel stopped at Thurii he secretly made his way to shore, and
escaped. The Athenian Assembly, baffled, pronounced judgment of exile
upon him, with confisca- tion of all his property, and a decree of death
in case the Athenians should ever capture him. Bitter at the thought
that his plans for empire and glory had been frustrated by a
condemnation which he continued to call unjust, Alcibiades took refuge
in the Peloponnesus, and, appearing before the Spartan Assembly,
proposed to help Sparta defeat Athens and establish there an
aristocratic go vernment. “As for democracy,” Thucydides makes him say,
“the men of sense among us knew what it was, and I perhaps as well as
any, as I have the more cause to complain of it; but there is nothing
new to be said of a patent absurdity.”” He advised them t o send a fleet
to help Syracuse and an army to capture Deceleia — an Attic town whose
pos- session should give Sparta military command of everything in Attica
but Athens. The silver mines at Laurium would cease to finance Athenian
re- sistance, and the subject cities, foreseeing the defeat of Athens,
would stop their payment of tribute. Sparta took his advice.</p>
<p>The intensity of his own resolution appeared in the completeness with
which he, so accustomed to luxury, took up the Spartan way of life. He
became frugal and reserved, eating coarse food, wearing a rough tunic
and no shoes, bathing in the Eurotas winter and summer, and observing
all Lacedaemonian laws and customs faithfully. Even so his good looks
and personal fascination ruined his plans. The Queen fell in love with
him, bore him a son, and proudly whispered to her friends that he was
the father. He excused himself to his intimates on the ground that he
could not resist the chance to establish his race as kings over Laconia.
King Agis, who had been away with the army, started home, and Alcibiades
conveniently se- cured a commission in a Spartan squadron that was
sailing to Asia. The King disowned the child and sent out secret orders
for the assassination of Alcibiades; but the latter’ s friends warned
him, and he escaped and joined the Persian admiral Tissaphemes at
Sardis.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>448</p>
<p>(CHAP.XVra</p>
<p>At the other end of the war front Nicias was encountering a
resistance which only Alcibiades’ genius for strat^y and intrigue could
have over- come. Nearly all of SicUy came to the aid of Syracuse. In 414
a Spartan fleet under GyUppus helped the Sicihan navy to bottle up the
Athenian ships in the harbor of Syracuse, cutting them off from any
supply of food. A final chance to escape was lost because of an ecUpse
of the moon, which frightened Nicias and many of his soldiers into
awaiting an opportunity more satisfactory to the gods. On the next day,
however, they found themselves surrounded, and were forced to give
battle. They were de- feated, first on sea and then on land. Nicias,
though ill and weak, fought bravely, and at last surrendered to the
mercy of the Syracusans. He was at once put to death; and the surviving
Athenians, almost all of the citizen class, were sent to die at hard
labor in the quarries of Sicily, where they tasted the fate of the men
who for generations had worked the mines of Laurium.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE TRIUMPH OF SPARTA</li>
</ol>
<p>The disaster broke the spirit of Athens. Nearly half the citizen body
was now enslaved or dead; half the women of the citizen class were in
effect widows, and the children were orphans. The funds that Pericles
had ac- cumulated in the treasury were almost exhausted; in another year
the last penny would be gone. Thinking the fall of Athens imminent, the
subject cities refused further tribute; most of her allies abandoned
her, and many flocked to the side of Sparta. In 41 3 Sparta, claiming
that the “fifty years” peace had been repeatedly violated by Athens,
renewed the war. The Lacedaemonians now took and fortified Deceleia; the
supply of food from Euboea and of silver from Laurium stopped; the
slaves in the mines at Laurium revolted, and went over to the Spartans
in a body of twenty thou- sand men. Syracuse sent an army to join in the
attack; and the Persian King, seeing an opportunity to avenge Marathon
and Salamis, provided funds for the growing Spartan fleet, on the
shameful understanding that Sparta would assist Persia in regaining
mastery over the Greek cities of Ionia.*</p>
<p>It was a proof of Athenian courage, ano of the vitality of
Athenian</p>
<p>democracy, that Athens stood off her enemies for ten years more. The
government was put upon an economical footing, taxes and capital levies
were collected to build a new fleet, and within a year of the defeat at
Syracuse Athens was ready to contest Sparta’s new mastery of the
sea.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVin) THE SUICIDE OF GREECE 449</p>
<p>Just as recovery seemed assured, the oligarchic faction, which had
never favored the war, and, indeed, looked to a Spartan victory to
revive aris- tocracy in Athens, organized a revolt, seized the organs of
government, and set up a supreme Council of Four Hundred (41 1). The
Assembly, cowed by the assassination of many democratic leaders, voted
its own abdi- cation. The rich supported the rebellion as the only way
of controlling the class war that had crossed the lines of the war
between Athens and Sparta — much as the struggle of the middle classes
against aristocracy united the liberal factions in England and America
in the American Revo- lution. Once in power, the oligarchs sent envoys
to make peace with Sparta, and secretly prepared to admit the Spartan
army into Athens. Mean- while Theramenes, leader of a center party of
moderate aristocrats, led a counterrevolution, and replaced the Four
Hundred — which had ruled some four months — with a Council of Five
Thousand (41 1). For a brief while Athens enjoyed that combination of
democracy and aristocracy which seemed to Thucydides and Aristotle“
(aristocrats both) to have been the best and fairest government that
Athens had known since Solon. But the second revolt, like the first, had
forgotten that Athens depended for its food and life upon its navy,
whose personnel, barring a few leaders, had been disfranchised by both
revolutions. Incensed at the news, the sailors announced that unless the
democracy were restored they would besiege Athens. The oligarchs waited
hopefully for a Spartan army; the Spartans as usual were tardy; the new
government took to its heels, and the vic- torious democrats restored
the old constitution (41 1).</p>
<p>Alcibiades had secretly supported the oligarchic revolt, hoping that
it might smooth a way for his return to Athens. Now the re-empowered
democracy, perhaps ignorant of these intrigues, but knowing how badly
Athens had fared since his exile, called him home with a promise of
amnesty. Deferring his triumph at Athens, he took charge of the fleet at
Samos, and moved into action with a celerity and success that brought
Athens a brief moment of happiness. Speeding through the Hellespont, he
met and completely destroyed a Spartan fleet at Cyzicus (410). After a
year’s</p>
<p>siege he captured Chalcedon and Byzantium, and thereby restored
Athens’ control of the food supply from the Bosporus. Sailing back south
he en- countered another Spartan squadron near the isle of Andros, and
defeated it with ease. Returning now (407) to Athens, he was welcomed
with uni- versal acclaim: his sins were forgotten, only his genius was
remembered, and Athens’ desperate need of an able general.” But Athens,
while cele - brating his victories, neglected to send him money for the
pay of his crews.</p>
<p>450 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.XVHI</p>
<p>Once again Alcibiades’ lack of moral scruple ruined him. Leaving the
greater number of his vessels at Notium (near Ephesus) in command of one
Antiochus, with strict instructions to stay in port and under no cir-
cumstances to give battle, he himself went with a small force to Caria
to raise funds for his men by something less than due process of law.
Antiochus, itching for fame, left his haven and challenged a Spartan
flotilla under Lysander. Lysander accepted the taunt, killed Antiochus
in a hand- to-hand fight, and sank or captured most of the Athenian
ships (407). When news of this catastrophe came to Athens the Assembly
acted with characteristic haste; it censured Alcibiades for leaving his
fleet, and removed him from command. Alcibiades, fearing now both Athens
and Sparta, fled to a refuge in Bithynia.</p>
<p>Desperate, the Athenians ordered that the gold and silver in the
statues and offerings on the Acropolis should be melted down for the
building of a new flotilla of 150 triremes, and offered freedom to those
slaves, and citi- zenship to those aliens, who would fight for the city.
The new armada defeated a Spartan fleet off the Arginusae Islands (south
of Lesbos) in 406, and Athens again thrilled with the news of victory.
But the Assembly was furious when it learned that its generals* had
allowed the crews of twenty-five ships, sunk by the enemy, to drown in a
storm. Hotheads protested that these souls, for lack of proper burial,
would wander rest- lessly about the universe; and accusing the survivors
of negligence in not attempting a rescue, they proposed that the eight
victorious generals (in- cluding the son of Pericles by Aspasia) should
be put to death. Socrates, who happened to be a member of the presiding
prytany for the day, re- fused to put the motion to a vote. It was
presented and passed over his protests, and the sentence was carried out
with the same precipitation with which it had been decreed. A few days
later the Assembly repented, and condemned to death those who had
persuaded it to execute the generals. Meanwhile the Spartans, weakened
by the defeat, offered peace again; but the Assembly, moved by the
oratory of the drunken Cleophon, refused.”</p>
<p>Led now by second-rate men, the Athenian fleet sailed north to meet
the Spartans under Lysander in the Sea of Marmora. From his hiding place
in the hills Alcibiades saw that the Athenian ships had taken up a
strategi- cally perilous position at Aegospotami, near Lampsacus. He
risked his life to ride down to the shore and advise the Athenian
admirals to seek a more sheltered place; but they distrusted his
counsel, and reminded him that he was no longer in command. On the next
day the decisive battle was fought;</p>
<ul>

commanders.</li>

<p>CHAP, xvin)</p>
<p>45 *</p>
<p>all but eight of the 208 Athenian ships were scuttled or taken, and
Lysander ordered the execution of three thousand Athenian captives.*
Learning that Lysander had issued orders for his assassination,
Alcibiades sought refuge in Phrygia with the Persian general Phamabazus,
who assigned him a cas- tle and a courtesan. But the Persian King,
persuaded by Lysander, ordered Phamabazus to kill his guest. Two
assassins besieged Alcibiades in his cas- tle, and set fire to it; he
came out naked and desperate, seeking the privilege of fighting for his
life; but before his sword could touch his assailants he was pierced by
their arrows and javelins. He died at the age of forty-six, the greatest
genius and most tragic failure in the military history of Greece.</p>
<p>Lysander, now absolute master of the Aegean, sailed down from city to
city, overthrowing the democracies and setting up oligarchic governments
subject to Sparta. Entering the Piraeus unresisted, he proceeded to
block- ade Athens. The Athenians resisted with their accustomed bravery,
but within three months their stock of food was exhausted, and the
streets were full of dead or dying men. Lysander gave Athens bitter and
yet lenient terms: he would not, he said, destroy a city that had in
time past performed such honorable services for Greece, nor would he
enslave its population; but he demanded the leveling of the Long Walls,
the recall of the oligarchic exiles, the surrender of all but eight of
the surviving Athenian ships, and a pledge to support Sparta actively in
any further war. Athens protested, and yielded.</p>
<p>Supported by Lysander, and led by Critias and Theramenes, the return-
ing oligarchs seized the government, and established a Council of Thirty
to rule Athens (404). These Greek Bourbons had learned nothing; they
confiscated the property and alienated the support of many rich
merchants; they plundered the temples, sold for three talents the
wharves of the Piraeus which had cost a thousand,* exiled five thousand
democrats, and put fifteen hundred others to death; they assassinated
all Athenians who were distasteful to them politically or personally;
they put an end to free- dom of teaching, assemblage, and speech, and
Critias himself, once his pupil, forbade Socrates to continue his public
discourses. Seeking to com- promise the philosopher to their cause, the
Thirty ordered him and four others to arrest the democrat Leon. The
others obeyed, but Socrates re- fused.</p>
<p>All the sins of the democracy were forgotten as the crimes of the
oli- garchs increased and multiplied. The number of men, even of
substantial means, who began to seek an end to this bloody tyranny grew
from day to day. When a thousand armed democrats under Thrasybulus
approached</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>452</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>the Piraeus, the Thirty found that hardly any but their immediate
partisans could be persuaded to fight for them. Critias organized a
small army, went out to battle, and was defeated and killed. Thrasybulus
entered Athens, and restored the democracy (403). Under his guidance the
Assembly behaved with unwonted moderation: it decreed death for only the
highest surviving leaders of the revolution, and allowed them to escape
this sentence by exile; it declared a general amnesty to all others who
had supported the oli- garchs; it even repaid to Sparta the hundred
talents that the ephors had lent to the Thirty.” These acts of humanity
and statesmanship gave to Athens at last the peace that she had not
known for a generation.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE DEATH OF SOCRATES</li>
</ol>
<p>Strange to say, the only cruelty of the restored democracy was com-
mitted upon an old philosopher whose seventy years should have put him
beyond the possibility of being a, danger to the state. But among the
lead- ers of the victorious faction was the same Anytus who years before
had threatened to revenge himself upon Socrates for dialectical slights
and the “corruption” of his son. Anytus was a good man: he had fought
bravely under Thrasybulus, had saved the lives of oligarchs who had been
taken captive by his soldiers, had been instrumental in arranging the
amnesty, and had left in undisturbed enjoyment of his property those to
whom it had been sold after confiscation by the Thirty. But his
generosity failed when it came to Socrates. He could not forget that
when he had gone into exile his son had stayed in Athens with Socrates,
and had become a drunk- ard.” It did not appease Anytus to observe that
Socrates had refused to obey the Thirty, and (if we may take X enophon’s
word for it) had de - nounced Critias as a bad ruler.” To Anytus it
seemed that Socrates, more than any Sophist, was an evil influence both
on morals and on politics; he was undermining the religious faith that
had supported morality, and his persistent criticism was weakening the
belief of educated Athenians in the institutions of democracy. The
murderous tyrant Critias had been one of Socrates’ pupils; the immoral
and treasonable Alcibiades had been his lover; Charmides, his early
favorite, had been a general under Critias, and had just died in battle
against the democracy.* It seemed fitting to Anytus that Socrates should
leave Athens, or die.</p>
<p>The indictment was brought forward by Anytus, Meletus, and Lycon</p>
<p>• Critias and Alcibiades h ad left the tutelage of Socrates early in
his career as a teacher, not liking die restraints which he preached to
them.**</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE SUICIDE OF GREECE 453</p>
<p>in 399, and read as follows: “Socrates is a public offender in that
he does not recognize the gods that the state recognizes, but introduces
new demoniacal beings” (the Socratic daimomon ) ; “he has also offended
by cor - rupting the youth.”**® The trial was held before a popular
court, or dikas - terioriy of some five hundred citizens, mostly of the
less educated class. We have no means of knowing how accurately Plato
and Xenophon have re- ported Socrates’ defense; we do, know that Plato
was present at the trial,” and that his account of Socrates’ “apology”
agrees in many points with Xen ophon’s. Socrates, says Plato, insisted
that he believed in the state ^gods, even in the divinity of the sun and
moon. “You say first that I do not be - lieve in gods, and then again
that I believe in demigods. … You might as well affirm the existence of
mules, and deny that of horses and asses.”*® And then he referred sadly
to the effects of Aristophanes’ satire:</p>
<p>I have had many accusers, who accused me of old, and their false</p>
<p>charges have continued during many years; and I am more afraid</p>
<p>of them than of Anytus and his associates. . . . For they began</p>
<p>when you were children, and took possession of your minds with</p>
<p>their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated
about the heavens above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made
the worse appear the better cause. These are the accusers</p>
<p>I dread; for they are the circulators of this rumor, and their
hearers</p>
<p>are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe
in</p>
<p>the gods. And they are many, and their charges against me are of</p>
<p>ancient date, and they made them in days when you were impres-</p>
<p>sionable — in childhood, or perhaps in youth — and the cause when</p>
<p>heard went by default, for there was none to answer. And hardest of
all, their names*! do not know and cannot tell, unless in the chance
case of a comic poet. . . . That is the nature of the accusation,
and</p>
<p>that is what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristoph-</p>
<p>anes.®</p>
<p>He lays claim to a divine mission to teach the good and simple life,
and no threat will deter him.</p>
<p>Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I</p>
<p>who, when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to com-</p>
<p>mand me at Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delium, remained where</p>
<p>• Croiset believed that the real cause of t he indictment was the
hostility of the Attic peasantry to anyone who cast doubt upon the state
gods. One of the chief markets for cattle was provided by the pious who
bought the animals to offer in sacrifice; any decrease in faith would
lessen this market. Aristophanes, in this interpretation, was the
mouthpiece of these peasants, before whom his plays, if successful,
would be repeated.®®</p>
<p>454</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>they placed me, like any other man, facing death — if, I say, now</p>
<p>when, as I conceive and imagine, God orders me to fulfil the philoso-
pher’s mission of searching into myself and other men, I were to</p>
<p>desert my post through fear of death If you say to me, Socrates,</p>
<p>this time we will let you off, but upon one condition, that you
are</p>
<p>not to inquire and speculate in this way any more … I should</p>
<p>reply: Men of Athens, I honor and love you; but I shall obey God</p>
<p>rather than you, and while I have life and strength I shall never
cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting anyone</p>
<p>whom I meet, after my manner, and convincing him, saying: O</p>
<p>my friend, why do you, who are a citizen of the great and mighty</p>
<p>and wise city of Athens, care so much about laying up the great-</p>
<p>est amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about</p>
<p>wisdom and truth? Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say to you, do</p>
<p>as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not; but whatever you</p>
<p>do, know that I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to
die</p>
<p>many times.“</p>
<p>The judges appear to have interrupted him at this point, and to have
bidden him desist from what seemed to them insolence; but he continued
in even haughtier vein.</p>
<p>I would have you know that if you kill such a one as I am, you</p>
<p>will injure yourselves more than you will injure me. … For if you</p>
<p>kill me you will not easily find another like me, who, if I may
use</p>
<p>such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of gadfly, given to
the</p>
<p>state by the God; and the state is like a great and noble steed
who</p>
<p>is tardy in his motions owing to his very size, and requires to
be</p>
<p>stirred into life. . . . And as you will not easily find another like
me,</p>
<p>I would advise you to spare me.“</p>
<p>The sentence of guilty was pronounced upon him by the small majority
of sixty; had his defense been more conciliatory it is likely that he
would have been acquitted. He had the privilege of proposing an
alternative pen- alty in place of death. At first he refused to make
even this concession; but on the appeal of Plato and other friends, who
underwrote his pledge, he offered to pay a fine of thirty minas (000).
The second polling of the jury condemned him by eighty more votes than
the first.“</p>
<p>It still remained open to him to escape from the prison; Crito and
other friends (if we may follow Plato) prepared the way with bribery,“
and prob- ably Anytus had hoped for such a compromise. But Socrates
remained himself to the last. He felt that he had but a few more years
to live, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE SUICIDE OF GREECE 455</p>
<p>that “he relinq uished only the most burdensome part of life, in
which all feel their powers of intellect diminished.”“ Instead of
accepting Crito’s proposal he examined it from an ethical point of view,
discussed it dia- lectically, and played the game of logic to the end.“
His disciples visited him daily in his cell during the month between his
trial and his execution, and he seems to have discoursed with them
calmly until the final hour. Plato pictures him as fondling the hair and
head of the young Phaedo, and sa ying, “Tomorrow, Phaedo, I suppose that
these fair locks will be cut”— in mourning.“ Xanthippe came in tears,
with their youngest child in her arms; he comforted her, and asked Crito
to have her escorted home. “You die undeservedly,” said an ardent
disciple; “Would you, then,” Socrates answered, “have me deserve
death?”“</p>
<p>After he was gone, says Diodorus,“ the Athenians regretted their
treat- ment of him, and put his accusers to death. Suidas makes Meletus
die by public stoning.“ Plutarch varies the tale: the accusers became so
unpopular that no citizen would light their fires, or answer their
questions, or bathe in the same water with them; so that they were at
last driven in despair to hang themselves.“ Diogenes Laertius reports
that Meletus was executed, Anytus exiled, and a bronze statue put up by
Athens in memory of the philosopher.“ We do not know if these stories
are true.*</p>
<p>The Golden Age ended with the death of Socrates. Athens was ex-</p>
<p>hausted in body and soul; only the degradation of character by
prolonged war and desperate suffering could explain the ruthless
treatment of Melos, the bitter sentence upon Mytilene, the execution of
the Arginusae generals, and the sacrifice of Socrates on the altar of a
dying faith. All the founda- tions of Athenian life were disordered: the
soil of Attica had been devas- tated by the Spartan raids, and the
slow-growing olive trees had been burned to the ground; the Athenian
navy had been destroyed, and control of trade and the food supply had
been lost; the state treasury was empty, and private fortunes had been
taxed almost to extinction; two thirds of the citizen body had been
killed. The damage done to Greece by the Persian invasions could not
compare with the destruction of Greek life and prop- erty by the
Peloponnesian War. After Salamis and Plataea Greece was left poor, but
exalted with courage and pride; now Greece was poor again, and Athens
had suffered a wound to her spirit which seemed too deep to be
healed.</p>
<p>• Grote®* doubts them, and they are rendered dubious by the efforts
of Plato and Xenophon to defend Socrates’ reputation. But these accounts
were generally accepted in antiquity (e.g^ by Tertullian and
Augustine”), and accord admirably with the habits of the Athenians.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>456</p>
<p>(CHAP.XVni</p>
<p>Two things sustained her: the restoration of democracy under men of
judgment and moderation, and the consciousness that during the last
sixty years, even during the War, she had produced such art and
literature as surpassed the like product of any other age in the memory
of man. Anaxag- oras had been exiled and Socrates had been put to death;
but the stimulus that they had given to philosophy sufficed to make
Athens henceforth, and despite herself, the center and summit of Greek
thought. What before had been formless tentatives of speculation were
now to mature into great systems that would agitate Europe for centuries
to come; while the hap- hazard provision of higher education by
wandering Sophists was to be re- placed by the first universities in
history — universities that would make Athens, as Thucydides had
prematurely called her, “the school of Hellas.” Through the bloodshed
