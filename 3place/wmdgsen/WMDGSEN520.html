<h4 id="chapter-ii-the-seven-years-war">CHAPTER II The Seven Years’
War</h4>
<p>1756-62</p>
<p>I. HOW TO START A WAR</p>
<p>B Y 1756 Europe had known eight years of peace. But the War of the
Austrian Succession had settled nothing. It had left Austria insecure in
Bohemia and Italy, Prussia insecure in Silesia, Britain insecure in
Hanover, France insecure in India, America, and on the Rhine. The Treaty
of Aix-la- Chapelle (1748) had achieved no territorial settlement
comparable in stability with that reached by the Treaty of Westphalia a
century before. The old balance of power had been disturbed by the
growth of the Prussian army and the British navy; that army might sally
forth on new absorptions; that navy needed only time to capture the
colonies of France, Holland, and Spain. The rising spirit of nationalism
was fed in England by the profits and prospects of commerce, in Prussia
by successful war, in France by a cul- tural superiority uncomfortably
conscious of martial decline. The conflict between Catholicism and
Protestantism had ended in a stalemate; both sides waited for some turn
of chance to renew the Thirty Years’ War for posses - sion of the
European soul.</p>
<p>Austria took the initiative in preparing a new throw of the human
dice. Maria Theresa, the thirty-nine-years-old but still fair head of
the Aus- trian empire, had all the pride of her Hapsburg ancestry, all
the anger of a woman scorned; how could she live with Silesia amputated
from her in- herited realm — whose territorial integrity all the major
states of Europe had guaranteed? Even the Frederick who had humiliated
her would later praise her “courage and ability,” and the way in which
“when it seemed that events were conspiring to ruin her, this… younger
ruler caught the spirit of gov- ernment, and became the soul of her
council.” 1 Defeated, yielding Silesia as the price of peace, she made
the peace only a truce, and devoted herself to the reform of
administration, the restoration of her shattered armies, and the
acquisition of strong allies. Frequently she visited the camps where her
troops were being trained; for this purpose she traveled to Prague in
Bo- hemia, to Olmiitz in Moravia; she inspired the soldiers with rewards
and distinctions, and even more by her regal and yet womanly presence.
Her generals did not have to swear fidelity to her, for this was in
their blood and chivalry; so the Prince of Liechtenstein spent 200,000
ecus (,500,000?) of his fortune in recruiting and equipping for her a
complete artillery corps. She founded near Vienna a War College for the
younger nobility, and brought to its staff the best teachers of
geometry, geography, fortification,</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE SE VEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>and history. “Under her,” said Frederick, “the military of Austria
acquired a degree of perfection never known to her predecessors, and a
woman car- ried out designs worthy of a great man.” 2</p>
<p>Diplomacy was the other side of the design. She sent agents
everywhere to win friends for Austria and stir up hostility to
Frederick. She noted the rising strength of Russia, which had been
organized by Peter the Great and was now commanded by the Czarina
Elizaveta Petrovna; she saw to it that Frederick’s sarcastic remarks
about the amours of the Russian Empress should reach her ears. Maria
Theresa would gladly have renewed her alliance with England, but that
entente had been soured by England’s separate peace with Prussia (1745),
which had compelled Austria to surrender Silesia. Now England’s foreign
policy was turning to protect her trade in the Baltic against the power
of Russia, and her hold on Hanover against any threat from Prussia or
France. She depended upon Russia for the timber of her navy, and she
depended upon her navy for victory in war. So on September 30, 1755,
England signed a treaty that bound Russia, in return for English
subsidies, to maintain 55,000 troops in Livonia; these, the English
hoped, would deter Frederick from any expansionist adventures to the
west.</p>
<p>But how should England deal with France? For hundreds of years France
had been her enemy. Time and again France had fomented or financed
Scottish hostilities to England; repeatedly she had prepared or
threatened to invade the British Isles. Now she was the only state that
challenged Britain on the seas and in the colonial world. To defeat
France decisively would be to win her colonies in America and India; it
would be to destroy her navy or render it impotent; the British Empire
would then be not only secure but supreme. So William Pitt the Elder
argued to Parliament day after day, in the most forceful oratory that
that body had ever heard. But could France be defeated? Yes, said Pitt,
by allying Prussia to England. Would it not be dangerous to let Prussia
grow stronger? No, Pitt answered; Prussia had a great army, which on
this plan would help England to protect Hanover, but she had no navy,
and therefore could not rival Britain on the sea. It seemed wiser to let
Protestant Prussia replace Catholic France or Catholic Austria as the
dominant power on the Continent, if that would let “Britannia rule the
waves” and capture colonies. Any victories of Frederick in Europe would
strengthen England overseas; hence Pitt’s boast that he would win
America and India on the battlefields of the Continent. England would
sup- ply money, Frederick would fight the land battles, England would
win half the world. Parliament consented; Britain proposed to Prussia a
pact for mutual defense.</p>
<p>Frederick had to accept this plan, for the development of events had
clouded his victories. He knew that France was flirting with Austria; if
France and Austria — worse yet, if Russia too — should unite against him
he could hardly resist them all; in such a predicament only England
could help him. If he signed the pact that England offered he could call
upon her to keep Russia from attacking him; and if Russia abstained
Austria might be dissuaded from war. On January 16, 1756, Frederick
signed the Treaty of</p>
<p>4 o</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Westminster, which pledged both England and Prussia to oppose the
entry of foreign troops into Germany. That single clause, they hoped,
would pro- tect Prussia from Russia and Hanover from France.</p>
<p>France, Austria, and Russia all felt that this treaty was a betrayal
by their allies. There had been no formal termination of the alliances
that had bound England with Austria, and France with Prussia, in the War
of the Austrian Succession. Maria Theresa, as she informed the British
ambassador, was shocked to learn that her English friends had signed a
pact with “the mortal and constant enemy of my person and my family.” 3
Louis XV complained that Frederick had deceived him; Frederick replied
that the treaty was purely defensive, and should give no offense to any
power not meditating offense. Mme. de Pompadour, who chose and dominated
French ministries, remem- bered that Frederick had charged her with
depositing great sums in British banks, and had called her “la
demoiselle Voisson” (Miss Fish) and “Cotillon IV” (Petticoat IV— fourth
mistress of Louis XV). Louis remembered that Frederick had ridiculed the
barnyard morals of the French King. The deser- tion struck France just
when her armies and treasury were exhausted, and when her navy was only
beginning to recover from the neglect it had suffered under the pacific
ministry of Cardinal Fleury. In 1756 France had forty-five ships of the
line, England had 130; 4 naval supplies were clogged with corruption and
theft, naval discipline had been ruined by the invidious promotion of
titled incompetents and the frequency of defeats. To whom now could
France turn for an ally? To Russia? — but England had forestalled her.
To Austria? — but in the last war France had violated her pledge to
guarantee Maria Theresa’s inheritance, had joined Prussia in attacking
her, and had continued to attack her even when Frederick had made peace.
Aus- tria under the Hapsburgs, France under the Bourbons, had been foes
for centuries; how could they and their peoples, long trained to mutual
hatred, suddenly become friends?</p>
<p>Yet that was pr ecisely the “reversal of alliances” that the Austrian
govern - ment now proposed to France. So far as we can now trace its
history, the plan took form in the mind of Count Wenzel Anton von
Kaunitz, the ablest, most penetrating, most persevering diplomat
produced on the European Continent in the eighteenth century. The Seven
Years’ War was to be a contest in arms between Frederick the Great and
Marshal Daun, and a con- test in brains between Kaunitz and Pitt.
“Prince Kaunitz,” said Frederick,</p>
<p>Being a second son, Kaunitz was told to become a priest; instead,
privately, he became a disciple of Voltaire. 6 As his father served as
ambassador to the Vatican and as governor of Moravia, the son inherited
diplomacy. At thirty- one he was Austrian envoy at Turin. His first
dispatch to his government was so logically reasoned on such careful
observation of political realities that Count von Uhlfeld, presenting it
to Maria Theresa, said, “Behold your first ministe r.” 7 At thirty
-seven he was Austrian plenipotentiary at the Congress of
Aix-la-Chapelle. There he defended the interests of Maria Theresa with
such pertinacity and skill that even in her defeat the Empress was
grateful</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>4 1</p>
<p>for his services and devotion. And when, as early as 1 749, he
broached to her his plan for an alliance with France, she met with an
open mind the idea of em- bracing the traditional enemy of her house.
Her heart was set on defeating Frederick and regaining Silesia. But
this, Kaunitz explained, could not be done by alliance with England,
whose power was on the seas; it required alliance with France and
Russia, whose power was on the land. Between these and Austria Frederick
could be crushed. The Empress bade Kaunitz labor to this end.</p>
<p>In 1751 he was sent as ambassador to Paris. He astonished the
nobility by the splendor of his official entry to the city; he pleased
the populace by giv- ing alms; he amused the salons with his luxurious
raiment, his assortment of cosmetics, and his laboriously powdered
curls; 8 “a most high -sniffing, fantas- tic, slightly insolent fellow,”
thought Carlyle; 9 but he impressed the King, his mistress, and their
ministers by his knowledge of affairs and his appraisal of policies.
Gradually he prepared their minds for an entente with Austria. He
pictured the possibility of bringing Russia, Poland, and Saxony into
tak- ing part in disciplining Frederick. He asked what France had gained
by her alliance with Prussia — only the aggrandizement of a land power
that chal- lenged the Continental hegemony of France; and had not
Frederick repeat- edly broken his pledge when it suited his
interest?</p>
<p>Kaunitz was making good headway when Maria Theresa called him back to
Vienna to be her chancellor, with full power over both domestic and
foreign affairs (1753). His plan was long opposed by the aging nobles at
the Viennese court; patiently he expounded and defended it; the Empress
sup- ported him; and on August 21, 1755, the proposal for an alliance
with France received the formal approval of the Imperial ministry. Count
Georg von Starhemberg, who had succeeded Kaunitz as Austrian ambassador
at Paris, was instructed to promote the grand design at every
opportunity with Louis XV and Mme. de Pompadour. Kaunitz sent a
flattering letter to the mai- tresse-en-titre (August 30, 1755), and
attached to it a note which she was requested to hand secretly to the
King. She did so. The note was from Maria Theresa, and read:</p>
<p>As an empress and a queen, I promise that nothing will ever be
disclosed of all that is going to be offered in my name by Count
Starhemberg to the most Christian King, and that the deepest secrecy in
this respect will always be maintained, whether negotiations succeed or
fail. It will be understood, of course, that the King will give a
similar declaration and promise.</p>
<p>Vienna, June 21, 1755 10</p>
<p>Louis appointed the Abbe de Bernis and the Marquise de Pompadour to
confer privately w ith Starhemberg at her pavilion “Babiole.” There the
am - bassador proposed, in the name of the Empress, that France should
renounce her alliance with Prussia, and should pledge at least financial
aid to Austria in case of war. He argued that Frederick was a useless
and unreliable ally, and he hinted that Frederick was even now engaged
in clandestine dealings with the British ministry. Austria, for her
part, would refrain from any hos - tile action against France if France
should make war upon England; in case</p>
<p>4 *</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>of such a war Austria would allow France to occupy Ostend and
Nieuport, and she might ultimately allow the Austrian Netherlands to
fall to France.</p>
<p>Louis noted that the pact would involve him in an Austrian war
against Prussia, but would not pledge Austrian aid to France against
England. He had good reason to fear Frederick’s army more than the
Austrian— so often defeated and so badly led in the recent war. He
instructed Bernis to reply that France would make no change in her
alliance with Prussia until proofs were offered of Frederick’s dealings
with England. Kaunitz could as yet offer no such proofs, and was
temporarily checked in his course. But when Louis received Frederick’s
acknowledgment of the Anglo -Prussian Treaty of Westminster, he saw that
his alliance with Prussia was factually dead. Per- haps, amid his sins,
it occurred to him that he might appease the Almighty by uniting the
Catholic powers — France, Austria, Poland, and Spain — in a plan to
control the destinies of Europe. 11 On May i, 1756, the Treaty of
Versailles completed the reversal of alliances. The preamble professed
that the sole aim of the convention was to maintain the peace of Europe
and the balance of power. If either of the contracting parties should be
threatened in its European possessions by any power but England, the
other would come to its aid by diplomatic intercession and, if
necessary, by subsidies or troops. Austria would not promise aid to
France against England, and France would not aid Austria against Prussia
unless Prussia should be clearly the aggressor. As Louis saw no
likelihood of Prussia endangering her gains by again attacking Austria,
he and his mistress could deceive themselves into believing that the new
alliance made for peace on the Continent.</p>
<p>Kaunitz had as yet fallen short of his aim to secure French aid
against Prussia. But he was patient; perhaps lie could prod Frederick
into attacking Austria. Meanwhile he had little difficulty in persuading
the Czarina into the new alliance. Elizaveta was eager to remove the
Prussian obstacle to Russia’s expansion westward. She offered to attack
Prussia before the end of 1756 if Austria would promise to do likewise;
and she promised, in that event, to make no peace with Prussia until
Silesia was completely restored to Austria. She learned with delight
that France had signed the Treaty of Versailles. Kaunitz had to check
her enthusiasm; he knew that her armies would not be ready for a major
campaign till 1757. Not until December 31, 1756, did he sign the
agreement by which Russia formally joined the Franco-Austrian
entente.</p>
<p>Meanwhile England, confident that her alliance with Frederick would
immobilize Austria, had already begun naval operations against France,
with- out any declaration of war. From June, 1755, English men-of-war
seized French shipping wherever possible. France retaliated by preparing
an inva- sion of England, and by sending a squadron of fifteen vessels,
under the Due de Richelieu, to attack Minorca. This island had been
captured by the British in the War of the Spanish Succession (1709). To
reinforce the small garrison there Britain dispatched ten ships under
Admiral John Byng; three additional vessels joined these at Gibraltar.
On May 20, 1756, the hostile fleets engaged near Minorca. The French
were repulsed, but the English squadron suffered</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>such damage that Byng led it back to Gibraltar, making no attempt to
land reinforcements at Minorca. The helpless garrison surrendered;
France had now a strategic post in the Mediterranean; Richelieu was
hailed as a hero in Paris and Versailles, and Byng was executed on his
own quarterdeck in Portsmouth Harbor (March 14, 1757) on the charge of
failure to do his utmost for victory; Voltaire and Richelieu interceded
for him in vain. This, said Voltaire, was England’s way of “encouraging
the others” who held British commands. On May 17, 1756, England declared
war on France, but the official inception of the Seven Years’ War was
left to Frederick.</p>
<p>He knew that his conquest of Silesia had left him subject to revanche
whenever Maria Theresa should find new resources and allies. His own re-
sources were perilously limited. His kingdom was an assortment of
disjecta membra: East Prussia was severed from Prussia proper by Poland,
and the Prussian provinces in Westphalia and East Frisia were separated
from Brandenburg by independent German states. Including these scattered
frag- ments and Silesia, all Prussia had in 1756 some four million
population, Eng- land eight million, France twenty. A large part of
Prussia’s population was in Silesia, which was still half Catholic and
pro- Austrian. Only seven miles from Berlin lay the border of hostile
Saxony, whose Elector, the Catholic King Augustus III of Poland, looked
upon Frederick as an insolent and rapacious infidel. How could one
survive in that caldron of enmity?</p>
<p>Only by wits, economy, a good army, and good generals. His own wits
were as keen as any; he was the best-educated ruler of his age; he came
off with honors in correspondence, conversation, and controversy with
Vol- taire. But his tongue was too sharp to be loosed; he might have had
calmer seas had he not spoken of Elizaveta Petrovna, Maria Theresa, and
Mme. de Pompadour as the “three first whores of Europe”; 12 it is
comforting to see that even the Great can be foolish now and then. As to
the economy of Prussia, Frederick subjected it to state control and what
seemed to him the unavoidable needs of possible war. He did not dare, in
the circumstances, to change the feudal structure of Prussian life, lest
it disturb the feudal organi- zation of his army. That army was his
salvation and his religion. Ninety per cent of his revenues went to its
maintenance. 13 He called it the Atlas whose strong shoulders carried
the state. 14 He built it up from the 100,000 men bequeathed him by his
father to 150,000 in 1756. He disciplined it with severe punishments to
immediate and precise obedience, to march steadily toward the opposing
line without firing a shot till ordered, to change direc- tion, and
maneuver en masse, under fire. It had, at the beginning of the war, the
best generals in Europe after Frederick himself — Schwerin, Seydlitz,
and James Keith.</p>
<p>Almost as important as his generals were the spies that he had
scattered among his enemies. They left him no doubt that Maria Theresa
was forming a cordon of hostile powers around him. In 1753-55 his agents
in Dresden and Warsaw secured copies of secret correspondence, between
the Saxon and Austrian ministries, which convinced him that these courts
were con- spiring to attack and — if fortune favored — dismember
Prussia, and that France</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>was conniving at the scheme. 15 On June 23, 1756, he ordered the
Prussian general in Konigsberg to be prepared for an attack from Russia.
He notified the British government that “the court of Vienna has three
designs to which its present steps are tending: to establish its
despotism in the Empire, to ruin the Protestant cause, and to reconquer
Silesia.” 16 He learned that Saxon y was planning to enlarge its army
from seventeen thousand to forty thousand during the winter; 17 he
guessed that the allies were waiting for the spring of 1757 to advance
upon him from three directions; and he resolved to strike before their
mobilization was complete.</p>
<p>He felt that his only chance of escaping from his peril was to
disable at least one of his foes before they could unite in action.
Schwerin agreed with him, but one of his ministers, Count von Podewils,
begged him not to give his enemies excuse for branding him as the
aggressor; Frederick called him “ Monsieur de la timide politique.” 18
Long ago, in a secret “Political Testa - ment” (1752), he had advised
his successor to conquer Saxony and thereby give Prussia the
geographical unity, the economic resources, and the political power
indispensable to survival. 19 He had put the idea aside as beyond
himself to realize; now it seemed to him a military necessity. He must
protect his western frontier by disarming Saxony. Even in his almost
idealistic Anti- Machiavel (1740) he had sanctioned an offensive war to
forestall a threat- ened attack. 20 Mitchell, the Prussian minister in
England, informed him that while the British government strongly desired
the maintenance of peace on the Continent, it recognized the emergency
that Frederick faced, and would not hold him “in the least to blame if
he tried to forestall his enemies instead of waiting until they carried
out their hostile intentions.” 21</p>
<p>In July, 1756, he sent an envoy to Maria Theresa soliciting assurance
that Austria intended no attack upon Prussia either in the current year
or in the next. A member of the Austrian cabinet thought such assurance
should be given; Kaunitz refused to send it; all that Maria Theresa
would say was that “in the present crisis I deem it necessary to take
measures for the security of myself and my allies, which tend to the
prejudice of no one.” 22 Frederick sent a second message to the Empress,
asking for a clearer reply to his re- quest for assurance; she answered
that she “had concluded no offensive alliance; and although the critical
situation of Europe compelled her to arm, she had no intention to
violate the Treaty of Dresden [which pledged her to peace with
Frederick], but she would not bind herself by any promise from acting as
circumstances required.” 23 Frederick had anticipated such a reply;
before it reached him he led his army into Saxony (August 29, 1756). So
began the Seven Years’ War.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE OUTLAW: 1 756-5 7</li>
</ol>
<p>He made a halfhearted attempt to enlist the Saxon Elector as an ally,
offering him Maria Theresa’s Bohemia as a bribe. Augustus scorned this
vicarious philanthropy; he ordered his generals to stop Frederick’s
advance,</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>and fled to Warsaw. The Saxon force was too small to resist the
finest army in Europe; it withdrew to the citadel at Pirna; Frederick
entered Dresden unopposed (September 9, 1756). At once he bade his
agents open the Saxon archives and bring him the originals of those
documents that had revealed Saxony’s participation in the plan to
chasten, perhaps to dismember, Prussia. The aging Electress-Queen with
her own person barred access to the ar- chives, and demanded that
Frederick should respect her royal inviolability; he ordered her to be
removed; she fled; the documents were secured.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa sent an army from Bohemia to dislodge the invader;
Freder- ick met it and defeated it at Lobositz, on the road from Dresden
to Prague (October 1). He returned to besiege Pirna; it surrendered
(October 15); he impressed the fourteen thousand captive Saxon soldiers
into his own divisions, arguing that this was cheaper than feeding them
as prisoners; the German appetite was notorious. He declared Saxony a
conquered country, and applied its revenues to his own needs. During the
winter he published the Saxon documents to the world. Maria Theresa
called them forgeries, and appealed to France, Russia, and all
God-fearing Christians to aid her against the man who, by flagrant
aggression, had again plunged Europe into war.</p>
<p>Europe generally agreed in condemning Frederick. The German princi-
palities, fearing a fate like Saxony’s if Frederick should triumph,
declared war upon Prussia (January 17, 1757), and raised a Reichsarmee,
or Imperial Army, for action against the Prussian King. Kaunitz lost no
time in remind- ing Louis XV that France had promised help in case
Austria should be threatened. The Dauphine, daughter of the Saxon
Elector, pleaded with her father-in-law to rescue her father. Mme. de
Pompadour, who had hoped to enjoy her reign in peace, now inclined to
war. In appreciation of her aid Maria Theresa sent her a royal portrait
decorated with gems valued at 77,- 278 livres; 24 Pompadour became
martial. Louis, usually slow to decide, de- cided with impetuous vigor.
By a second Treaty of Versailles (May 1, 1757) France bound herself in
defensive-offensive alliance with Austria, pledged her an annual subsidy
of twelve million florins, agreed to equip two German armies, and
proposed to devote a French force of 105,000 men to the “ destruction
totale de la Frusse She promised never to make peace with Prussia until
Silesia had been restored to Austria. When that restoration had been
consummated France was to receive five frontier towns in the Austrian
Netherlands, and these southern Netherlands were to be transferred to
the Bourbon Infante of Spain in return for Spanish duchies in Italy.
Perhaps France was knowingly writing off her colonies to British
conquest by devot- ing nearly all her resources to absorbing “Belgium.”
Kaunitz could feel that he had won a vital diplomatic victory.</p>
<p>He found it easy now to draw Russia into active aid. The Convention
of St. Petersburg (February 2, 1757) committed Russia and Austria each
to put eighty thousand troops into the field, and to make war until
Silesia had been reunited with Austria, and Prussia had been reduced to
a minor power. Turning to Sweden, Kaunitz brought her into the alliance
by guaranteeing to her, in the event of victory, all that part of
Pomerania which had been</p>
<p>4 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>conceded to her in the Treaty of Westphalia. Sweden was to contribute
25,000 men, Austria and France were to finance them. Poland, under its
refugee King Augustus III, pledged her modest resources to the Franco-
Austrian alliance. Now nearly all of Europe except England, Hanover,
Den- mark, Holland, Switzerland, Turkey, and Hesse-Cassel was united
against Frederick.</p>
<p>And England was tempted to leave Frederick to his fate. George II saw
with horror that his beloved Hanover, the electorate from which his
father had come to rule Britain, lay defenseless in the path of
overwhelming armies, with Frederick too distant and harassed to send
substantial aid. The temptation was made almost irresistible when
Kaunitz offered to leave Hanover inviolate if England would keep out of
the Continental war; at that moment Fred- erick’s fate was touch and go.
Pitt, who was appointed secretary of state on November 19, 1756, was at
first inclined to let Prussia and Hanover shift for themselves, while
England would concentrate all her martial resources upon the contest for
colonies; little wonder that George II, loving Hanover, hated Pitt. Soon
Pitt changed his mind, and declared that a France victorious against
Frederick would be master of Europe, and soon of England too; Parliament
must vote money for Frederick and troops for Hanover; France must be
made to spend herself in Europe, while England would pluck colo- nies
and markets out of the conquered seas.</p>
<p>So in January, 1757, Britain signed a second alliance with Prussia,
promis- ing subsidies to Frederick and soldiers to Hanover. But then,
suddenly, Pitt was dismissed (April 5), politics befuddled policy, help
to Frederick was delayed, and for almost a year he stood alone, with
145,000 men, against armies converging from every quarter upon him: in
the west 105,000 troops from France and 20,000 from the German states;
in the south 133,000 from Austria; in the east 60,000 from Russia; in
the north 16,000 from Sweden. And on that same day which saw Pitt fall,
the Emperor Francis I — the usually amiable and docile husband of Maria
Theresa — officially branded Frederick as an outlaw, and called upon all
good men to hunt him out as an impious enemy of mankind.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>FROM PRAGUE TO ROSSBACH: 1 7 57</li>
</ol>
<p>On January 10 Frederick sent to his ministers in Berlin some secret
instruc- tions: “If I am killed, affairs must continue without the
slightest alteration.</p>
<p>It was a useless gesture, for without his military genius Prussia was
lost. His only hope lay in facing his foes one at a time before they
could unite. The French were not yet ready for battle, and perhaps the
regiments that England was sending to Hanover could hold them for a
while. The Austrians were accumulating in nearby Bohemia and Moravia
immense magazines of</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>arms and provisions to equip their armies for an invasion of Silesia.
Frederick decided first to capture those precious stores, fight the
Austrians, then march back to face the French. He led his own force from
Saxony, and ordered the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern from East Germany, and
Marshal Schwerin from Silesia, to advance into Bohemia and meet him in
the hills overlooking Prague from the west. It was so done; the
magazines were captured; and on May 6, near Prague, 64,000 Prussians met
61,000 Austrians under Prince Charles of Lorraine in the first great
battle of the war.</p>
<p>The issue was decided not by numbers, nor by strategy, but by
courage. Schwerin’s regiments, under Austrian fire, marched waist -deep,
shoulder- deep, through morasses. For a time they lost heart and turned
in flight; then Schwerin, aged seventy-three, rallied them, wrapped the
colors about his body, rode straight in the face of the foe, was struck
by five balls at once, and fell dead. His men, loving him almost more
than they feared death, charged in fury against the enemy, and turned
defeat into victory. The slaughter on both sides was enormous, and
Frederick’s losses included four hundred officers and his best general;
in this war generals did not die in bed. The 46,000 surviving Austrians
retired into their citadel in Prague, and pre- pared to resist
siege.</p>
<p>But Frederick found siege difficult, for Marshal Leopold von Daun,
ablest of the Austrian commanders, was coming up from Moravia with
another 64,000 men. Leaving part of his army to blockade the citadel,
Frederick marched eastward with 32,000 troops, and met the advancing
masses at Kolin (June 16). The odds against him were too great, and the
generalship of Daun was in this case superior to his own. Two of Freder
ick’s generals dis - obeyed his orders, causing confusion; Frederick
lost his temper, and shouted to his retreating cavalry, “Would you live
forever?” 28 The infantry, over - whelmed by carnage, refused to
advance. Frederick, despondent, withdrew from the field, leaving 14,000
Prussians dead, wounded, or prisoners. He led his 1 8,000 survivors back
to Prague, abandoned the siege, and returned with his remnants toward
Saxony.</p>
<p>At Leitmeritz he rested his army for three weeks. There, on July 2,
he received word that his mother, Sophia Dorothea, had died. The iron
man of war broke down, wept, and secluded himself for a day. Perhaps he
won- dered, now, whether his assault on Silesia, seventeen years before,
had been a foolish tempting of Nemesis. He shared his grief with his
sister Wilhelmine, margravine of Bayreuth, whom he loved beyond any
other soul. On July 7, his pride nearly spent, he sent her a desperate
appeal:</p>
<p>Since you, my dear sister, insist upon undertaking the great work of
peace, I beg you to be good enough to send M. de Mirabeau to… offer the
favorite [Mme. de Pompadour, formerly Cotillon IV] as much as 300,000
crowns for peace…. 1 leave it all to you… whom 1 adore, and who,
although far more accomplished than I, is another myself. 27</p>
<p>Nothing came of this approach. Wilhelmine tried another way: she
wrote to Voltaire, then living in Switzerland, and begged him to use his
influence. Voltaire transmitted her proposal to Cardinal de Tencin, who
had opposed</p>
<p>4 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>he Franco- Austrian alliance. Tencin tried and failed. 28 The allies
were sniff- ing the scent of victory. Maria Theresa talked now of
completely dismem- bering Frederick’s realm: not only must Silesia and
Glatz be restored to her, but Magdeburg and Halberstadt were to go to
Augustus III, Pomerania was to revert to Sweden, and Cleves and
Ravensburg were to reward the Elector Palatine.</p>
<p>Her hopes seemed reasonable. A French “army of the Dauphine” had
entered Germany; part of it, under Pompadour’s favorite general, the
Prince de Soubise, was coming to join with the Imperial army at Erfurt;
another part, under Marechal d’Estrees, advanced to meet a Hanov erian
force under George II’s son, the Duke of Cumberland. Near the village of
Hastenbeck</p>
<p>Word of this humiliating capitulation may have reached Frederick at
ap- proximately the same time as news that a Swedish army had landed in
Pomerania, and a Russian army of 100,000 men under Marshal Stepan Aprak-
sin had invaded East Prussia and overwhelmed a force of 30,000 Prussians
at Gross- Jagersdorf (July 30). These reverses, added to his own debacle
in Bohemia, almost destroyed Frederick’s hope of overcoming enemies so
numerous and so fortified with reserves of materials and men. Having
aban- doned the morality as well as the theology of Christianity, he
fell back upon the ethics of the Stoics, and meditated suicide. To the
end of the war he carried on his person a phial of poison; he was
resolved that his foes should never take him except as a corpse. On
August 24 he sent to Wilhelmine a semihysterical paean to death:</p>
<p>And now, ye promoters of sacred lies, go on leading cowards by the
nose;… to me the enchantment of life is ended, the charm disappears. I
see that all men are but the sport of Destiny, and that if there do
exist some Gloomy and Inexorable Being, who allows a despised herd of
creatures to go on multiply- ing here, he values them as nothing; he
looks down upon a Phalaris crowned and a Socrates in chains, upon our
virtues and our misdeeds, upon the horror of war and the cruel plagues
that ravage the earth, as things indifferent to him. Wherefore my sole
refuge and only haven, dear sister, is in the arms of death. 29</p>
<p>She answered (September 15) by vowing to join him in suicide:</p>
<p>My dearest brother, your letter, and the one you wrote to Voltaire,…
have almost killed me. What fatal resolutions, great God! Ah, my dear
brother, you say you love me, and yet you drive a dagger into my heart.
Your letter… made me shed rivers of tears. Now I am ashamed of such
weakness…. Your lot shall be mine. I will not survive either your
misfortunes or those of the House I belong to. You may calculate that
such is my firm resolution. But after this avowal let me entreat you to
look back at what was the pitiable state of your enemy when you lay
before Prague. It is the sudden whirl of Fortune for both parties….
Caesar was once the slave of pirates, and became lord of the earth. A
great genius like yours finds resources even when all seems lost. I
suffer a thousand times more than I can tell you; nevertheless hope does
not abandon me…. I must finish, but I shall never cease to be, with the
most profound respect, your Wilhelmine. 30</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>She appealed to Voltaire to support her plea, and early in October,
in his first letter to Frederick since 1 7 5 3, he seconded her
arguments:</p>
<p>The Catos and Othos, whose death your Majesty thinks noble, had
nothing else they could do but fight or die…. You must keep in mind how
many courts there are that see in your invasion of Saxony a violation of
international law…. Our morality and your situation are far from
requiring such an act [as suicide]…. Your life is needed; you know how
dear it is to a numerous family…. The affairs of Europe are never long
on the same basis, and it is the duty of a man like you to hold himself
in readiness for events…. If your courage led you to that heroic
extremity it would not be approved. Your partisans would condemn it,
your enemies would triumph. 31</p>
<p>To which Frederick replied in prose and verse:</p>
<p>Pour moi , menace du naufrage ,</p>
<p>Je dois , en affrontant Vorage ,</p>
<p>Penser , vivre , et mourir en roi —</p>
<p>“as for me, menaced with shipwreck, I must, confronting the storm,
think, live, and die like a king.” 32</p>
<p>Between poems (always in French) he searched for the French army; now
he longed for a battle that would settle for him the question of life or
death. At Leipzig, October 15, he sent for Johann Christoph Gottsched
(who wrote verses in German), and tried to convince him that German
poetry was impossible. So many explosions — Knap, Klop , Krotz, Krok ;
so many gutturals, so many consonants — even in the professor’s name
five in a row; how could you make a melody with such a language?
Gottsched pro- tested; Frederick had to prepare for another march; but
ten days later, back in Leipzig, he received the old poet again, found
time to listen to a Gott- sched ode in German, and gave him a gold
snuffbox as a parting token of good will.</p>
<p>During that literary interlude more bad news came: a force of Croats
under Count Hadik was advancing upon Berlin, and rumor said that Swedish
and French battalions were converging upon the Prussian capital.
Frederick had left a garrison there, but far too small to buffet such an
avalanche. If Berlin should fall, his principal source of supplies in
arms, powder, and cloth- ing would be in the hands of the enemy. He
hurried with his army to rescue the city and his family. On the march he
received word that no French or Swedish force was moving toward Berlin;
that Hadik, halting in the suburbs, had exacted a ransom of ,£27,000
from Berlin, and had led his Croats con- tentedly away (October 16).
There was other comforting intelligence: the Russians under Apraksin,
racked with disease and famishing for food, had withdrawn from East
Prussia into Poland. Less pleasant messages informed Frederick that the
main French army under Soubise had entered Saxony, had plundered the
western cities, and had united with the Imperial army under the Duke of
Saxe-Hildburghausen. The weary King turned back in his tracks, and led
his troops to the vicinity of Rossbach, some thirty miles west of
Leipzig.</p>
<p>There his tired army, reduced to 21,000 men, came at last face to
face</p>
<p>5 °</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>with the 41,000 troops of France and the Reich. Even so, Soubise
advised against risking battle; better, he said, to continue evading
Frederick and wearing him out with fruitless marches until the
overwhelming superiority of the allies in manpower and materials should
force him to yield. Soubise knew the breakdown of discipline in his
ranks, and the lack of enthusiasm, in the mostly Protestant soldiers of
the Reichsarmee, for fighting against Frederick. 33 Hildburghausen
pleaded for action, and Soubise gave in. The German marshal led his men
on a long detour to attack the Prussians on their left flank. Frederick,
watching from a housetop in Rossbach, ordered his cavalry under Seydlitz
to execute a countermovement against the right flank of the enemy.
Screened by hills, and proceeding with disciplined speed, the Prussian
cavalry, 3,800 strong, charged down upon the allied troops and overcame
them before they could re-form their ranks. The French came up too late,
and were shattered by the Prussian artillery; in ninety minutes the
crucial battle of Rossbach was over (November 5, 1757). The allies re-
treated in disorder, leaving 7,700 dead on the field; the Prussians lost
only 550 men. Frederick ordered the prisoners to be well treated, and
invited the captured officers to share his table. With French grace and
wit he excused the limited fare: “Mats, messieurs , je ne vous attendais
pas sito t, en si grand nombre” (But, gentlemen, I did not expect you so
soon, in so great num - ber). 34</p>
<p>Military men on all sides marveled at the disproportion of the
losses, and at the superior generalship that had made this possible.
Even France confessed admiration, and the French people, so lately
allied with Prussia, could not yet look upon Frederick as their foe. Did
he not speak and write good French? The philosophes applauded his
victories and claimed him as their champion of free thought against the
religious obscurantism that they were fighting at home. 35 Frederick
responded to the gallant emotions of the French by saying, “I am not
accustomed to regard the French as enemies.” 36 But pri - vately he
composed — in French — a poem expressing his pleasure at having given
the French a kick in the cul, which Carlyle delicately translated as
“the seat of honor.” 37</p>
<p>England rejoiced with him, and put new faith in her ally. London
cele- brated his birthday with bonfires in the streets, and devout
Methodists ac- claimed the infidel hero as the savior of the one true
religion. Pitt had been brought back to head the government (July 29,
1757); henceforth he was the unswerving support of the Prussi an King.
“England has taken long to produce a great man for this contest,” said
Frederick, “but here is one at last!” 38 Pitt denounced the Convention
of Kloster -Zeven as cowardice and treason — though the King’s son had
signed it; he persuaded Parliamen t to send a better army to protect
Hanover and help Frederick (October); and whereas it had voted only £
164,000 for Cumberland’s “Army of Observa - tion,” now it voted £
1,200,000 for an “Army of Operations.” Pitt and Frederick united in
choosing, as l eader of this new force, Frederick’s</p>
<p>brother-in-law and military pupil, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick,
thirty-six years old, handsome, cultured, brave, who played the violin
so well, said</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR 51</p>
<p>Burney, that “he might have made his fortune by it.” 39 Here was an
instru - ment nobly fit to play second fiddle to Frederick’s flute!</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE FOX AT BAY: 1757-60</li>
</ol>
<p>Frederick had not much leisure for rejoicing. A French army under</p>
<p>Richelieu still held much of Hanover. On the very day of Rossbach
43,000 Austrians laid seige to Schweidnitz, the principal stronghold and
storehouse of the Prussians in Silesia; Frederick had left 41,000 men
there, but they had been reduced by desertion and death to 28,000; these
were poorly led by the Duke of Brunswick- Bevern, who ignored the King’s
order to attack the besiegers; on November 11 he surrendered the
fortress, yielding to the Austrians 7,000 prisoners, 330,000 thalers,
and provisions sufficient to main- tain 88,000 men for two months. The
victors, amplified to 83,000 troops by union with forces under Prince
Charles and Marshal Daun, went on to Breslau; on November 22 they
overwhelmed a small force of Prussians; Breslau fell, and most of
Silesia was now restored to the triumphant Maria Theresa. Frederick
might well feel that his victory at Rossbach had been annulled.</p>
<p>But that victory had renewed his courage, and he no longer spoke of
suicide. His army too had recovered from its marches and battles, and
seemed usefully resentful of the ravages with which French soldiers had
desecrated Protestant churches in Saxony. Frederick appealed to his men
to help him recapture Silesia. They marched 170 milqs in twelve wintry
days through difficult terrain. En route they were joined by the remains
of the Prussian forces that had been defeated at Schweidnitz and
Breslau. On December 3 Frederick, with 43,000 men, sighted the 72,000
Austrians who were encamped near Leuthen on the road to Breslau. That
evening Frederick addressed his captains in a speech prefiguring the
martial harangues of Napoleon:</p>
<p>It is not unknown to you, gentlemen, what disasters have befallen
here while we were busy with the French and Imperial armies. Schweidnitz
is gone,… Breslau is gone and all our war stores there; most of Silesia
is gone…. My embarrassments would be beyond recovery if it were not for
my unbounded confidence in your courage, your constancy, and your love
for the Fatherland…. There is hardly one among you who has not
distinguished himself by some conspicuous deed of valor…. I flatter
myself, therefore, that in the coming opportunity you will not fail in
any sacrifice that your country may demand of you.</p>
<p>This opportunity is close at hand. I should feel that I had
accomplished nothing if Austria were left in possession of Silesia. Let
me tell you, then, that I propose, in defiance of all the rules in the
art of war, to attack the army of Prince Charles, three times as large
as ours, wherever I find it. The question is not of his numbers or the
strength of his position; all this, by the courage of our troops, and
the careful execution of our plans, I hope to overcome. I must take this
step, or all will be lost; we must defeat the enemy, or we shall lie
buried under his batteries. So I read the case; so I shall act.</p>
<p>5 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Make my determination known to all officers of the army; prepare the
men for the work that is to come, and tell them that I feel justified in
demanding exact fulfillment of orders. For you, when I reflect that you
are Prussians, can I think that you will act unworthily? But if there
should be one or another among you who dreads to share all dangers with
me [here Frederick looked into each face in turn], he can have his
discharge, this evening, and shall suffer not the least reproach from
me….</p>
<p>I knew that none of you would desert me. I count, then, absolutely on
your faithful help, and on certain victory. Should 1 not survive to
reward you for your devotion, the Fatherland must do it. Return now to
camp, and report to your troops what you have heard from me.</p>
<p>The cavalry regiment that does not at once, on receipt of the order,
throw itself upon the enemy I will, directly after the battle, unhorse,
and make it a garrison regiment. The infantry battalion that even begins
to hesitate, no mat- ter what the danger may be, shall lose its colors,
its swords, and the gold lace from its uniforms.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, good night. Soon we shall have beaten the enemy,
or we shall see each other no more. 40</p>
<p>Heretofore the Austrians, following a Fabian policy, had avoided
battle with Frederick, hesitating to pit their troops and generals
against Prussian discipline and Frederick’s tactical genius; but now,
inspired by superior numbers and recent victories, they decided, against
the advice of Marshal Daun, to face the King in battle. And so, on
December 5, 1757, the human pawns of dynastic rivalry — 43,000 against
73,000 — advanced upon each other’s swords and guns in the greatest
battle of the war. “That battle,” said Napoleon, “was a masterpiece. Of
itself it suffices to entitle Frederick to a place in the first rank
among generals.” 41 He sought first to gain the hills, from which his
artillery could fire over the heads of his infantry into the enemy’s
ranks. He deployed his troops in an oblique order anciently used by
Epaminondas of Thebes: separate columns were to move at approxi- mately
forty-five-degree angles to strike the enemy sidewise and so disorder
his line of defense. Frederick pretended to be aiming his strongest
pressure against the Austrian right; Prince Charles weakened his left
wing to reinforce the right; Frederick poured his best troops upon the
diminished left, routed it, and then turned to attack the right wing on
its flank, while the Prussian cavalry rode down upon that same wing from
concealment in the hills. Order triumphed over disorder; the Austrians
surrendered or fled; 20,000 of them were taken prisoner — a catch
unprecedented in military history ; 42 3,000 more were left dead, and
116 pieces of artillery fell into Prussian hands. The Prussians too lost
heavily — 1,141 dead, 5,118 wounded, 85 cap- tured. When the carnage was
over Frederick thanked his generals: “This day will bring the renown of
your name, and of the nation, to the latest posterity.” 43</p>
<p>The victor pursued his victory with passionate resolve to regain
Silesia. Within a day after the battle his army besieged the Austrian
garrison in Breslau; Sprecher, its commander, posted placards through
the town pro- claiming instant death for anyone who breathed a word of
surrender; twelve days later (December 18) he surrendered. Frederick
took there 17,000 prisoners and precious military stores. Soon all
Silesia, except heavily gar-</p>

<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>risoned and fortified Schweidnitz, was back in Prussian hands. Prince
Charles, humble before Daun’s silent reproaches, retired to his estate
in Austria. Bernis and other French leaders advised Louis XV to make
peace; Pompadour overruled them, and replaced Bernis with the Due de
Choiseul as minister for foreign affairs (1758); but France, suspecting
that she was fighting for Austria while sacrificing her colonies, lost
heart for the war. Richelieu showed so little enthusiasm, so little
fervor in pursuing his advan- tage in Hanover, that he was recalled from
his command (February, 1758).</p>
<p>He was replaced by the Comte de Clermont, an abbe licensed by the
Pope to keep his benefice while playing general. 44 The French evacuated
Hanover before the resolute advances of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick;
they yielded Minden to him in March; soon all Westphalia was freed from
the French, who there too had made themselves hated by plunder and
desecration. 45 Ferdinand marched west and, with half as many men,
defeated Clermont’s main force at Krefeld on the Rhine (June 23).
Clermont yielded his post to the Due de Contades; the defeated army was
joined by Soubise with new French levies and the survivors of Rossbach;
before this united force Ferdi- nand withdrew to Munster and
Paderborn.</p>
<p>Encouraged by a season of victories, England signed (April 1 1 ) a
third treaty with Frederick, promising him a subsidy of / 670,000 by
October, and pledging herself against a separate peace. 46 Meanwhile
Frederick, his own Prussia having been taxed to exhaustion, taxed Saxony
and other conquered territory likewise. He issued debased currencies,
and (like Voltaire) hired Jewish financiers to make profitable deals for
him in foreign exchange. 47 By the spring of 1758 he had rebuilt his
army to 145,000 men. In April he at- tacked and recovered Schweidnitz.
Eluding the main Austrian army (recon- stituted under Daun), he moved
south with 70,000 men to Olmiitz in Mo- ravia; if he could capture this
Austrian stronghold he hoped to march against Vienna itself.</p>
<p>But about this same time 50,000 Russians under the Count of Fermor
swept over East Prussia and attacked Ciistrin, only fifty miles east of
Berlin. Fred- erick abandoned the siege of Olmiitz and hurried north
with 15,000 men. On the way he learned that Wilhelmine was critically
ill; he stopped at Griissau to send her an anxious note: “O you, dearest
of my family, you whom I have most at heart of all beings in this world
— for the sake of whatever is most precious to you, preserve yourself,
and let me have the consolation of shed- ding my tears on your breast !”
48</p>
<p>After days and nights on the march he joined a Prussian force under
Count zu Dohna near Ciistrin. On August 25, 1758, with 36,000 men, he
faced Fermor’s 42,000 Russians at Zorndorf. His favorite tactic of a

<p>But who could continue to fight on so many fronts at once? While
Fred- erick was in the north Daun had led his army to a junction with
the Imperial regiments, and was now besieging Dresden, where Frederick
had left a gar- rison under Prince Henry. A force of 16,000 Swedes
marched through Pom- erania, joined the Russians in ravaging a great
part of the Mark of Branden- burg, and might with them endanger Berlin
again. A new army of 30,000 Austrians and Hungarians, under General
Harsch, entered Silesia and headed for Breslau. Which of the three
capitals should be defended first? Reorgan- izing his dispirited and now
rebellious troops, Frederick marched them twenty-two miles a day across
Prussia into Saxony, and reached his belea- guered brother just in time
to discourage Daun from attack. After giving his men two weeks’ rest, he
set out to drive Harsch from Silesia. At Hochkirch in Silesia Daun
blocked his path. Frederick pitched camp close to the enemy, and waited
four days for provisions to arrive from Dresden. Suddenly, at five
o’clock on the morning of October 14, 1758, Daun, whom Frederick had
relied upon to avoid the initiative, fell upon the Prussian right wing.
The movement of the Austrians had been concealed by a thick fog, the
Prussians were literally caught napping; they had no time to form the
tactical lines that Frederick had designed. Frederick exposed himself
recklessly in his efforts to restore order; he succeeded, but too late
to retrieve the situation. After five hours of battle, 37,000 pawns
against 90,000, he gave the signal for retreat, leaving on the field
9,450 men, to the Austrian loss of 7,590.</p>
<p>Again he contemplated suicide. With so able a general as Daun leading
the Austrians, with so able a general as Saltykov forming a new Russian
army, and with his own forces declining in number, quality, and
discipline, while his foes could make up any loss, it seemed clear that
a Prussian victory could come only through a miracle; and Frederick did
not believe in miracles. On the day after Hochkirch he showed to his
reader, de Katt, an Apology for Suicide which he had composed, and said,
“I can end the tragedy when I choose.” 49 On that day (October 15, 1758)
Wilhelmine died, leaving in - structions tha t her brother’s letters to
her might be laid on her breast in her tomb. 50 Frederick appealed to
Voltaire to write something in her memory; Voltaire responded well, but
his ode to the “time heroique et pure” 51 could not match the simple
fervor of the King’s tribute in his Histoire de la Guerre</p>
<p>The goodness of her heart, her generous and benevolent inclinations,
the nobility and elevation of her soul, the sweetness of her character,
brought to- gether in her the brilliant gifts of the mind with a
foundation of solid virtue…. The tenderest and most constant friendship
united the King [Frederick wrote in the third person] and this worthy
sister. These ties had been formed in their earliest childhood; the same
education and the same sentiments had further bound them, and a mutual
fidelity in every test had rendered these ties in- dissoluble. 52</p>
<p>Spring brought new French armies into the field. On April 13, 1759,
at Bergen (near Frankfurt-am-Main), a French force ably led by the Due
de Broglie gave Ferdinand of Brunswick a taste of defeat, but Ferdinand
re- deemed himself at Minden. There (August 1), with 43,000 Germans,

<p>55</p>
<p>lish, and Scots, he routed 60,000 French under Broglie and Contades
so de- cisively, and with relatively so little loss, that he was able to
send 12,000 troops to Frederick to make good the weakening of the King’s
army by a disastrous campaign in the east.</p>
<p>On July 23 Saltykov’s 50,000 Russians, Croats, and Cossacks
overwhelmed at Ziillichau the 26,000 Prussians whom Frederick had left
to guard the approaches from Poland to Berlin; nothing there now stood
in the way of a Russian avalanche upon the Prussian capital. The King
had no choice but to rely upon his brother to hold Dresden against Daun,
while he himself marched to face the Russians. Reinforced on the way, he
was able to muster 48,000 men, but meanwhile 18,000 Austrians under
General Laudon had joined the Russians, raising Saltykov’s total to
68,000. On August 12, 1759, these two armies — the largest masses of
expendable human flesh since the competitive slaughters of the War of
the Spanish Succession — fought at Ku- nersdorf (sixty miles east of
Berlin) the most merciless, and for Frederick the most tragic, battle of
the war. After twelve hours of fighting he seemed to have the advantage;
then Laudon’s 18,000 men, who had been kept in re - serve, fell upon the
exhausted Prussians and drove them into a rout. Fred- erick dared every
danger to rally his troops; three times he led them person- ally to the
attack; three horses were shot under him; a small gold case in his
pocket stopped a bullet that might have ended his career. He was not
happy over his escape; “Is there not,” he cried, “one devil of a ball
that can reach</p>
<p>As soon as Frederick could find a place to rest he dispatched a
message to Prince Henry: “Of an army of 48,000 men I have at this moment
not more than 3,000, and I am no longer master of my forces…. It is a
great calamity, and I will not survive it.” He notified his generals
that he was be - queathing his command to Prince Henry. Then he dropped
upon some straw and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next morning he found that 2 3,000 fugitives from the battle had
re- turned to their regiments, ashamed of their flight, and ready to
serve him again if only because they longed to eat. Frederick forgot to
kill himself; instead he reorganized these and other poor souls into a
new force of 32,000 troops, and took a stand on the road from Kunersdorf
to Berlin, expecting to make a last attempt to protect his capital. But
Saltykov did not come. His men, too, had to eat; they were in enemy
country and found foraging dan- gerous, and the line of communications
with friendly Poland was long and hazardous. Saltykov thought it was
time for the Austrians to take their turn against Frederick. He gave the
order to retreat.</p>
<p>Daun agreed that the next move should be his. Now, he felt, was the
time</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>o take Dresden. Prince Henry had withdrawn a force from that city to
go to Frederick’s help; he had left only 3,700 men to guard the citadel,
but powerful defenses had been raised to stave off attack. The new
commander in Dresden, Kurt von Schmettau, was a loyal servant of the
King, but when he received word from Frederick himself, after
Kunersdorf, that all seemed lost, he gave up hope of successful
resistance. An Imperial army, fifteen thou- sand strong, was approaching
Dresden from the west; Daun was actively cannonading the city from the
east. On September 4 Schmettau surrendered; on September 5 a message
reached him from Frederick that he should hold out, that help was on the
way. Daun, with 72,000 men, now made Dresden his winter quarters.
Frederick came up to nearby Freiberg and wintered there with half that
number.</p>
<p>The winter of 1759-60 was exceptionally severe. For several weeks
snow covered the ground to the knee. Only the officers found shelter in
homes; Frederick’s common soldiers lived in makeshift cabins, hugged
their fires, laboriously cut and brought wood to feed them, and
themselves had scarcely any other food than bread. They slept close
together for mutual warmth. Disease, in both camps, took almost as many
lives as battle had done; in six- teen days Daun’s army lost in this way
four thousand men. 54 On November 19 Frederick wrote to Voltaire: “If
this war continues much longer, Europe will return to the shades of
ignorance, and our contemporaries will become like savage beasts.”
55</p>
<p>France, though immeasurably richer than Prussia in money and men, was
near bankruptcy. Choiseul nevertheless equipped a fleet to invade
England, but it was destroyed by the English at Quiberon Bay (November
20, 1759). Taxes were multiplied with all the ingenuity of governments
and financiers. On March 4, 1759, the Marquise de Pompadour had secured
the appoint- ment of Etienne de Silhouette as controller general of
finance. He proposed curtailment of pensions, a tax on the estates of
nobles, the conversion of their silver into money, and even a tax on the
tax-collecting farmers general. The rich complained that they were being
reduced to mere shadows of their for- mer selves; thenceforth silhouette
became the word for a figure reduced to its simplest form. On October 6
the French treasury suspended payment on its obligations. On November 5
Louis XV melted his silver to give good example; but when Silhouette
suggested that the King should get along with- out the sums usually
allotted him for his gambling and games, Louis agreed with such visible
pain that Choiseul vetoed the idea. On November 2 1 Sil- houette was
dismissed:</p>
<p>Like almost every Frenchman, the King felt that he had had enough of
war; he was ready to hear proposals of peace. Voltaire had sounded out
Frederick on the matter in June; Frederick replied ( July 2): “I love
peace quite as much as you could wish, but I want it good, solid, and
honorable”; and on September 22 he added, again to Voltaire: “For making
peace there</p>

<p>at Kunersdorf) to Choiseul, who found in them no handle for
negotiation. And faithful ally Pitt, who was busy absorbing French
colonies, how could he make peace before he had built the British
Empire?</p>
<p>V. THE MAKING OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE</p>
<p>The most imp ortant phase of the Seven Years’ War was not fought in
Europe, for there it effected only minor changes in the map of power. It
was fought on the Atlantic, in North America, and in India. In those
areas the results of the war were immense and enduring.</p>
<p>The first step in the formation of the British Empire had been taken
in the seventeenth century, by the passage of naval supremacy from the
Dutch to the English. The second was marked by the Treaty of Utrecht
(1713), which granted England the monopoly of supplying African slaves
to the Spanish and English colonies in America. The slaves produced
rice, tobacco, and sugar; part of the sugar was turned into rum; the
trade in rum shared in enriching the merchants of England (old and New);
the profits of trade financed the expansion of the British fleet. By
1758 England had 156 ships of the line; France had seventy-seven. 57
Hence the third step in building the Empire was the reduction of French
power on the seas. This process was interrupted by Richelieu’s success
at Minorca, but it was resumed by the destruction of a French fleet off
Lagos, Portugal (April 13, 1759), and of another in Quiberon Bay.
Consequently the commerce of France with her colonies dropped from
thirty million livres in 1755 to four million in 1760.</p>
<p>Supremacy on the Atlantic having been won, the way was open for the
British conquest of French America. This included not only the basin of
the St. Lawrence River and the region of the Great Lakes, but also the
basin of the Mississippi from the Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; even the
Ohio River Valley was in French hands. French forts dominated Chicago,
Detroit, and Pittsburgh — whose change of name from Fort Duquesne
symbolized the re- sults of the war. The French possessions blocked the
westward expansion of the English colonies in America; had England not
won the Seven Years’ War, North America might have been divided into a
New England in the East, a New France in the center, and a New Spain in
the West; the divisions and conflicts of Europe would have been
reproduced in America. The pa- cific Benjamin Franklin warned the
English colonists that they could never be safe in their possessions,
nor free in their growth, unless the French were checked in their
American expansion; and George Washington came into history by
attempting to take Fort Duquesne.</p>
<p>Canada and Louisiana were the two doors to French America; and the
nearer to England and France was Canada. Through the St. Lawrence came
supplies and troops for the habitants, and that door was guarded by the
French fort of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island at the mouth of the
great river. On June 2, 1758, Louisbourg was besieged by an English
flotilla of forty-two vessels, bearing 1 8,000 soldiers, under Admiral
Edward Boscawen.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>The fort was defended by ten ships and 6,200 men; reinforcements sent
from France were intercepted by the British fleet. The garrison fought
bravely, but soon its defenses were shattered by British guns. The
surrender of the fort (July 26, 1758) began the British conquest of
Canada.</p>
<p>The process was only slightly retarded by the strategy and heroism of
the Marquis de Montcalm. Sent from France (1756) to command the French
regulars in Canada, he advanced from one success to another until
frustrated by corruption and discord in the French-Canadian
administration, and by the inability of France to send him aid. In 1756
he captured an English fort at Oswego, giving the French control of Lake
Ontario; in 1757 he besieged and took Fort William Henry, at the head of
Lake George; in 1758, with 3,800 men, he defeated 1 5,000 British and
colonial troops at Ticonderoga. But he met his match when, with 15,000
men, he defended Quebec against the English general James Wolfe, who had
only 9,000 soldiers under his command. Wolfe himself led his troops in
scaling the heights to the Plains of Abraham. Montcalm was mortally
wounded in directing the defense; Wolfe was mortally wounded on the
field of victory (September 12-13,</p>
<p>1759). On September 8, 1760, the French governor of Canada*
Vaudreuil- Cavagnal, surrendered, and the great province passed under
British control.</p>
<p>Turning their ships south, the English attacked the French islands in
the Caribbean. Guadeloupe was taken in 1759, Martinique in 1762; all the
French possessions in the West Indies — St.-Domingue excepted — fell to
Brit- ain. To add to the profits of victory Pitt sent squadrons to
Africa to capture the French slave-trading stations on the west coast;
it was done; the French trade in slaves collapsed; Nantes, its chief
port in France, decayed. The price of slaves in the West Indies rose,
and British slave merchants made new fortunes in supplying the demand.
58 We should add that the English were not any more inhumane in this
imperial process than the Spanish or the French; they were merely more
efficient; and it was in England that the antislavery movement first
took effective form.</p>
<p>Meanwhile British enterprise — naval, military, commercial — was busy
ab- sorbing India. The English East India Company had set up strongholds
at Madras (1639), Bombay (1668), and Calcutta (1686). French merchants
established domination at Pondicherry, south of Madras (1683), and at
Chandernagore, north of Calcutta (1688). All these centers of power ex-
panded as Mogul rule in India declined; each group used bribery and sol-
diery to extend its area of influence; already, in the War of the
Austrian Succession (1740-48), France and England had fought each other
in India. The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had merely interrupted the
conflict; the Seven Years’ War renewed it. In March, 1757, an English
fleet under Admiral Charles Watson, aided by troops of the East India
Company under a Shrop- shire lad named Robert Clive, took Chandernagore
from the French; on June 23, with only 3,200 men, Clive defeated 50,000
Hindus and French at Plassey (eighty miles north of Calcutta) in a
battle that assured British mas- tery in northeast India. In August,
1758, an English fleet under Admiral George Pococke drove from Indian
waters the French squadron that had</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>been protecting French possessions along the coast; thereafter, with
the British free, the French unable, to bring in men and supplies, the
triumph of England was only a matter of months. In 1759 the French siege
of Madras by the Comte de Lally was frustrated by the arrival of British
provisions and reinforcements by sea. The French were decisively
defeated at Wandiwash on January 22, 1760; Pondicherry surrendered to
the British on January 16,</p>

<p>India and Canada remained, until our own time, two bastions, east and
west, of an empire that was built with money, courage, cruelty, and
brains, in full accord with the international morals of the eighteenth
century. In tardy retrospect we now perceive that that empire was a
natural product of human nature and material conditions, and that the
alternative to it was not the independence of helpless peoples, but a
similar empire established by France. In the long run, despite its
Clives and Hastingses and Kiplings, the rule of half the world by the
British navy — the comparatively humane and urbane maintenance of order
amid ever-threatening chaos — was a blessing rather than a bane to
mankind.</p>

</ol>
<p>What was the hunted Prussian fox doing in that harsh winter of 1759-
60? He was raising and debasing money, conscripting and training men,
writing and publishing poetry. In January a pirate Parisian publisher
issued Oeuvres du philo sophe de Sans-Souci , joyfully printing those
reckless poems which Voltaire had carried off with him from Potsdam in
1753, and for which Frederick had had him intercepted and detained at
Frankfurt-am- Main. Those poems would amuse uncrowned heads, but would
make royal wigs tremble with rage, including those of Frederick’s ally
George II. Fred - erick protested that the pirated publication was
corrupted by malignant interpolations; he bade his fr iend the Marquis
d’Argens (director of fine arts at the Berlin Academy) to issue at once
an “authentic edition” carefully purged. It was so done in March, and
Frederick could turn back to war. On February 24 he wrote to
Voltaire:</p>
<p>Steel and death have made terrible ravages among us, and the sad
thing is that we are not yet at the end of the tragedy. You can easily
imagine the result of such cruel shocks upon me. I wrap myself up in
stoicism as well as I can…. I am old, broken, gray, wrinkled; I am
losing my teeth and my gaiety. 59</p>
<p>Vast masses of soldiery were being marshaled to determine which ruler
should tax most men. Saltykov, in April, was returning from Russia with
100,000; Laudon had 50,000 Austrians in Silesia, ag ainst Prince Henry’s
34, - 000; Daun at Dresden, with 100,000, hoped to break through
Frederick’s 40,000, who were now encamped near Meissen; the French, with
125,000, were waiting to advance against Ferdinand’s 70,000; altogether
375,000 men</p>
<p>6o</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>were being aimed at Berlin. On March 21, 1760, Austria and Russia re-
newed their alliance, with a secret clause giving Prussia to Russia as
soon as Silesia should be restored to Austria. 60</p>
<p>Laudon drew first blood of the year 1760, overwhelming 1 3,000
Prussians at Landeshut (June 23). On July 10 Frederick began to besiege
Dresden with heavy artillery, laying most of Germany’s then loveliest
city in ruins. The bombardment availed him nothing; hearing that Laudon
was approach- ing Breslau, he abandoned the siege, marched his men one
hundred miles in five days, encountered Laudon’s army at Liegnitz
(August 15, 1760), in - flicted upon it a loss of 10,000 men, and
entered Breslau. But on October 9 an army of Cossacks under Fermor
captured Berlin, ransacked its military stores, and exacted a ransom of
two million thalers — equal to half the British subsidy that Frederick
was receiving annually. He marched to relieve his capital; the Russians
fled on hearing of his approach, and Frederick turned back to Saxony. On
the way he wrote to Voltaire (October 30): “You are fortunate in
following Candide’s advice, and limiting yourself to the cultiva - tion
of your garden. ’Tis not granted to everyo ne to do so. The ox must plow
the furrow, the nightingale must sing, the dolphin must swim, and I must
fight.” 61</p>
<p>At Torgau on the Elbe (November 3) his 44,000 Prussians met 50,000
Austrians. Frederick sent half his army under Johann von Ziethen to
detour and attack the enemy in the rear. The maneuver did not succeed,
for Ziethen was delayed by an enemy detachment on the way. Frederick led
his own divisions personally into the fury of the battle; here too three
horses were shot under him; a shell struck him in the chest, but with
spent force; he was knocked unconscious to the ground, but soon
recovered; “It is nothing,” he said, and returned to the fray. He won a
Pyrrhic victory; the Austrians gave way, with a loss of 1 1,260 men, but
Frederick left 1 3,120 Prussians on that field. He retired to Breslau,
now his main center of supplies. Daun still held Dresden, waiting
patiently for Frederick to die. Winter again gave the sur- vivors
rest.</p>
<p>The year 1761 was one of diplomacy rather than war. In England the
death of George II (October 25, 1760), who had cared deeply for Hanover,
and the accession of George III, who cared for it much less, gave a
royal sanction to popular resentment of a war that was weighing heavily
upon English pounds. Choiseul put out feelers from France for a separate
peace; Pitt refused, and kept full faith with Frederick; but the British
contingent in Hanover was reduced, and Ferdinand had to yield Brunswick
and Wolfen- biittel to the French. Choiseul turned to Spain, and in a
“Pacte de Famille”— a family pact between Bourbon kings — persuaded her
to join in the alliance against Prussia. Military developments concurred
with these diplomatic re- verses to bring Frederick again to the verge
of debacle. Laudon with 72,000 men affected a junction with 50,000
Russians; they completely severed Fred- erick from Prussia, and laid
plans to take and keep Berlin. On September 1 , 1761, the Austrians
again took Schweidnitz and its stores. On October 5 Pitt, overwhelmed by
the popular demand for peace, resigned rather than betray</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR</p>
<p>Frederick. His successor, the Earl of Bute, thought Frederick’s cause
hope - less, and saw, in the negotiation of peace, a means of
strengthening George III against Parliament. He pleaded with Frederick
to admit defeat at least to the extent of surrendering part of Silesia
to Austria. Frederick demurred; Bute refused him any further subsidy.
Nearly all Europe, including many Prussians, called upon Frederick to
make concessions. His troops had lost any hope of victory; they warned
their officers that they would not attack the enemy again, and, if
attacked, would surrender. 62 As the year 1761 ended Frederick found
himself alone against a dozen foes. He admitted that only a miracle
could save him.</p>
<p>A miracle saved him. On January 5, 1762, 63 Czarina Elizaveta, who
hated Frederick, died, and was succeeded by Peter III, who admired him
as the ideal conqueror and king. When Frederick heard the news he
ordered all Russian prisoners to be clad, shod, fed, and freed. On
February 23 Peter de- clared the war with Prussia at an end. On May 5 he
signed a treaty of peace drawn up, at his request, by Frederick himself;
on May 22 Sweden followed suit; on June 10 Peter re-entered the war, but
as an ally of Prussia. He donned a Prussian uniform and volunteered for
service “under the King my master.” It was one of the most remarkable ov
erturns in history.</p>
<p>It warmed Frederick’s heart, and restored morale in his army, but he
half agreed with his enemies that Peter was crazy. He was alarmed when
he heard that Peter proposed to attack Denmark to recover Holstein;
Frederick used every effort to dissuade him, but Peter insisted;
finally, Frederick tells us, “I had to keep silent, and abandon this
poor prince to the self -confidence that destroyed him.” 84</p>
<p>Bute, now actively hostile to Frederick, asked Peter to let the
twenty thousand Russians now in the Austrian army continue there; Peter
sent a copy of this message to Frederick, and ordered the Russian troops
to join and serve Frederick. Bute offered Austria a separate peace,
promising to support the cession of Prussian territory to Austria;
Kaunitz refused; Fred- erick denounced Bute as a scoundrel. 65 He was
pleased to learn that France had ended her subsidies to Austria, and
that the Turks were attacking the Austrians in Hungary (May, 1762).</p>
<p>On June 28 Peter was dep osed by a coup d’etat that established
Catherine II as “Empress of all the Russias”; on July 6 Peter was
assassinated. Catherine ordered Czernichev, who commanded the Russians
under Frederick, to bring them home at once. Frederick was just
preparing an attack upon Daun. He asked Czernichev to conceal for three
days the news of the Czarina’s in - structions. Without using these
Russian auxiliaries Frederick defeated Daun at Burkersdorf (July 21).
Czernichev now withdrew his troops, and Russia took no further part in
the war. Relieved of danger in the north, the King drove the Austrians
before him, and recaptured Schweidnitz. On October 29 Prince Henry, with
24,000 men, defeated 39,000 Austrians and Imperials at Freiberg in
Saxony; this was the only major action of the war in which the Prussians
were victorious when not under Frederick’s command. It was also the last
important battle of the Seven Years’ War.</p>

<p>All Western Europe was exhausted. Prussia most of all, where boys of
fourteen had been conscripted, and farms had been devastated, and
merchants had been ruined by the stifling of trade. Austria had more men
than money, and had lost vital Russian aid. Spain had lost Havana and
Manila to the English, and nearly all her navy had been destroyed.
France was bankrupt, her colonies were gone, her commerce had almost
disappeared from the sea. England needed peace to consolidate her
gains.</p>
<p>On September 5, 1762, Bute sent the Duke of Bedford to Paris to
negotiate a settlement with Choiseul. If France would yield Canada and
India England would restore Guadeloupe and Martinique, and France might
keep, with British consent, Frederick’s western provinces of We sel and
Gelderland. 66 Pitt denounced these proposals with passionate eloquence,
but public opinion supported Bute, and on November 5 England and
Portugal signed with France and Spain the Peace of Fontainebleau. France
gave up Canada, India, and Minorca; England restored to France and Spain
her conquests in the Caribbean; France promised to maintain neutrality
between Prussia and Aus- tria, and to withdraw her armies from Prussian
territory in western Ger- many. A further Peace of Paris (February 10,
1763) confirmed these ar- rangements, but left France her fishing rights
near Newfoundland, and some trading posts in India. Spain ceded Florida
to England, but received Louisi- ana from France. Technically these
agreements violated Britain’s pledge against a separate peace; actually
they were a boon to Frederick, for they left him with only two
adversaries — Austria and the Reich; and he was now confident that he
could hold his own against these disheartened enemies.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa resigned herself to peace with her most hated foe. All
her major allies had abandoned her, and 100,000 Turks were marching into
Hungary. She sent an envoy to Frederick, proposing truce. He accepted,
and at Hubertusburg (near Leipzig), February 5-15, 1763, Prussia,
Austria, Sax- ony, and the German princes signed the treaty that ended
the Seven Years’ War. After all the shedding of blood, ducats, rubles,
thalers, kronen, francs, and pounds the status quo ante bellutn was
restored on the Continent: Fred- erick kept Silesia and Glatz, Wesel and
Gelderland; he evacuated Saxony, and promised to support the candidacy
of Maria Theresa’s son Joseph as King of the Romans and therefore
emperor-to-be. At the final signing Fred- erick’s aides congratulated
him on “the happiest day of your life”; he replied that the happiest day
of his life would be the last one. 67</p>
<p>What were the results of the war? To Austria, the permanent loss of
Silesia, and a war debt of 100,000,000 ecus. The prestige of the
Austrian rulers as traditional holders of the Imperial title was ended;
Frederick dealt with Maria Theresa as ruler of an Austro-Hungarian,
rather than a Holy Roman, Empire. The German princes of the Empire were
now left to their resources, and would soon submit to the Prussian
hegemony in the Reich;</p>

<p>he Hapsburg power declined, the Hohenzollern power rose; the road was
open for Bismarck. Patriotism and nationalism began to think in terms of
Germany instead of each proudly separate state; German literature was
stim- ulated to Sturm und Drang, and mounted to Goethe and Schiller.</p>
<p>Sweden lost 25,000 men, and gained nothing but debts. Russia lost
120,000 men to battle, hardship, and disease, but would soon reproduce
them; she had opened a new era in her modern history by marching into
the west; the partition of Poland was now inevitable. For France the
result was enormous losses in colonies and commerce, and a
near-bankruptcy that moved her an- other step toward collapse. For
England the results were greater than even her leaders realized: control
of the seas, control of the colonial world, the establishment of a great
empire, the beginning of 182 years of ascendancy in the world. For
Prussia the results were territorial devastation, thirteen thou- sand
homes in ruins, a hundred towns and villages burned to the ground,
thousands of families uprooted; 180,000 Prussians (by Frederick’s
estimate 68 ) had died in battle, camp, or captivity; even more had died
through lack of medicine or food; in some districts only women and old
men were left to till the fields. Out of a population of 4,500,000 in
1756, only 4,000,000 re- mained in 1763.</p>
<p>Frederick was now the hero of all Germany (except Saxony!). He en-
tered Berlin in triumph after an absence of six years. The city, though
desti- tute, with every family in mourning, blazed with illuminations to
welcome him, and acclaimed him as its savior. The iron spirit of the old
warrior was moved: “Long live my dear people!” he cried. “Long live my
children!” 69 He was capable of humility; in his hour of adulation he
did not forget the many mistakes he had made as a general — he the
greatest of modern generals ex- cepting Napoleon; and he could still see
the thousands of Prussian youths whose bloody deaths had paid for
Silesia. He himself had paid. He was now prematurely old at fifty-one.
His back was bent, his face and figure lean and drawn, his teeth lost,
his hair white on one side of his head, his bowels racked with colic,
diarrhea, and hemorrhoids. 70 He remarked that now his proper place was
in a home for elderly invalids. 71 He lived twenty-three years more, and
tried to redeem his sins with peaceful and orderly government.</p>
<p>Politically the main results of the Seven Years’ War were the rise of
the British Empire, and the emergence of Prussia as a first-class power.
Economi- cally, the chief result was an advance toward industrial
capitalism: those Gargantuan armies were glorious markets for the mass
consumption of mass- produced goods; what client could be more desirable
than one that promised to destroy the purchased goods at the earliest
opportunity, and order more? Morally, the war made for pessimism,
cynicism, and moral disorder. Life was cheap, death was imminent,
suffering was the order of the day, pillage was permissible, pleasure
was to be seized wherever it could for a moment be found. “But for this
campaign,” said Grimm in Westphalia, 1757, “I should never have
conceived how far the horrors of poverty and the injustice of man can be
carried”; 72 and they had only begun. The suffering helped, as well as
hindered, religion: if a minority was turned to atheism by the stark</p>

<p>reality of evil, the majority was moved to piety by the need to
believe in the ultimate triumph of the good. A reaction to religion
would soon come in France, England, and Germany. Protestantism in
Germany was saved from destruction; probably, if Frederick had lost,
Prussia would have experienced, like Bohemia after 1620, a compulsory
restoration of Catholic faith and power. The triumph of imagination over
reality is one of the humors of history.</p>
