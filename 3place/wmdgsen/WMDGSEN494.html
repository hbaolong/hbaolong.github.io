<h4 id="chapter-xxv">CHAPTER XXV</h4>
<p>Henry VIII and the Monasteries</p>
<p>1 535 - 4-7</p>
<p>I. THE TECHNIQUE OF DISSOLUTION</p>
<p>I N 1535 Henry, too busy with love and war to play pope in retail as
well as gross, appointed the agnostic 1 Cromwell “viceregent of the King
in all his ecclesiastical jurisdiction.” Cromwell now guided foreign
policy, domestic legislation, the higher judiciary, the Privy Council,
the intelligence service, the Star Chamber, and the Church of England;
Wolsey at apogee had never had so many long and grasping fingers in so
many juicy pies. He kept an eye, too, on all printing and publication;
he persuaded the King to forbid the printing, sale, or importation of
books except after approval by agents of the Crown; and he had
anti-papal literature published at the gov- ernment’s expense.
Cromwell’s innumerable spies kept him informed on all movements or
expressions of opposition to Henry or himself. A remark of pity for
Fisher or More, a jest about the King, could bring a secret trial and
long imprisonment; 2 and to predict the date of the King’s death was to
incur one’s own. 3 In special cases, to make conclusions certain,
Cromwell acted as prosecutor, jury, and judge. Nearly everyone in
England feared and hated him.</p>
<p>His chief difficulty was that Henry, though omnipotent, was bankrupt.
The King was anxious to enlarge the navy, to increase or improve his
har- bors and ports; his court and personal expenses were extravagant;
and Crom- well’s system of government required a broad stream of funds.
How to raise money? Taxes were already high to the point where
resistance made further collection more costly than lucrative; the
bishops had drained their parishes to appease the King; and no gold
poured in from America such as daily succored England’s enemy, the
Emperor. Yet one institution in England was wealthy, suspect, decrepit,
and defenseless: the monasteries. They were suspect because their
ultimate allegiance was to the pope, and their sub- scription to the Act
of Supremacy was considered insincere and incomplete; they were, in the
eyes of the government, a foreign body in the nation, bound to support
any Catholic movement against the King. They were decrepit because they
had in many cases ceased to perform their traditional functions of
education, hospitality, and charity. They were defenseless be-</p>
<p>563</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>cause the bishops resented their exemption from episcopal control;
because the nobility, impoverished by civil war, coveted their wealth;
because the business classes looked upon monks and friars as idling
wasters of natural resources; and because a large section of the
commonalty, including many good Catholics, no longer believed in the
effieacy of the relics that the monks displayed, or in the Masses that
the monks, if paid, offered for the dead. And there were excellent
precedents for closing monasteries; Zwingli had done it in Zurich, the
Lutheran princes in Germany, Wolsey in England. Parlia- ment had already
(1533) voted authority to the government to visit the monasteries and
compel their reform.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1535 Cromwell sent out a trio of “visitors,” each
with a</p>
<p>To the Parliament that met on February 4, 1536, Cromwell submitted a
“Black Book,” now lost, revealing the faults of the monasteries, and
recom - mending, with strategic moderation, that monasteries and
convents having an income of £ 200 (0,000?) or less per year should be
closed. The Parlia- ment, whose members had been largely chosen by
Cromwell’s aides, 11 con - sented. A Court of Augmentations was
appointed by the King to receive for the royal treasury the property and
revenues of these 376 “ lesser mon- asteries.” Two thousand monks were
released to other houses or to the world — in the latter case with a
small sum or pension to tide them over till they found work. Of the 1 30
nunneries only eighteen had an income over £ 200, but only half were now
closed.</p>
<p>The drama of dissolution was interrupted by a triple rebellion in the
north. Just as Christianity had been born in the cities and had reached
the villager? — pagani — last, so, in Switzerland, Germany, and England
the Reformation rose in the towns and was long resisted in the
countryside. Protestantism in England and Scotland decreased as distance
from London or Edinburgh in- creased; it reached Wales and northern
England tardily, and found scant</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) HENRY VIII AND THE MONASTERIES 565</p>
<p>welcome in Ireland. In the northern shires of England the spoliation
of the lesser monasteries kindled a fire of resentment that had long
been pre- pared by mounting taxation, the royal dictatorship over the
clergy, and clandestine priestly exhortations. Dispossessed monks who
found it hard to collect their pensions or to get work joined the
already numerous and plain- tive unemployed; dispossessed nuns,
wandering from shelter to shelter, stirred public anger against the
government ; and the aides of Cromwell’s visitors fed the fury by
decking themselves in the spoils of the monastic chapels, making copes
into doublets, priestly tunics into saddlecloths, and relic cases into
dagger sheaths. 12</p>
<p>On October 2, 1536, a visitor who had just closed a convent in
Legboume was attacked by a crowd in neighboring Louth; his records and
credentials were seized and burned, and, with a sword at his breast, he
was compelled to swear loyalty to the commons. All in the crowd took an
oath to be faithful to the King and the Roman Catholic Church. On the
morrow a rebel army gathered at Caistor, a few miles away; priests and
homeless monks exhorted them; the local gentry were forced-some were
willing — to join. On the same day a larger muster of villagers took
place at Horncastle, another town in Lincolnshire. The chancellor of the
bishop of Lincoln was accused of be- ing an agent of Cromwell; he was
taken from his bed and beaten to death with staves. The rebels designed
a banner picturing a plow, a chalice, a horn, and the five “last words”
of Christ, and they drew up demands which were</p>
<p>His answer was furious and uncompromising. He charged the rebels with
ingratitude to a gracious ruler; insisted that the closing of the lesser
mon- asteries was the will of the nation expressed through Parliament;
and bade the insurgents surrender their leaders and disperse to their
homes on pain of death and confiscation of goods. At the same time Henry
ordered his mili- tary aides to collect their forces and march under the
Earl of Suffolk to the assistance of Lord Shrewsbury, who had already
organized his retainers to withstand attack; and he wrote privately to
the few nobles who had joined the revolt. These, now perceiving that the
King could not be awed, and that the poorly armed insurgents would soon
be overwhelmed, persuaded so many of them to return to their villages
that the rebel army, over the pro- tests of the priests, rapidly melted
away. Louth gave up fifteen leaders; a hundred more were captured, and a
royal pardon was declared for the rest.</p>
<p>566 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>The captives were taken to London and the Tower; thirty-three,
including seven priests and fourteen monks, were hanged; the rest were
leisurely freed. 13</p>
<p>Meanwhile a still more serious uprising had developed in Yorkshire. A
young barrister, Richard Aske, found himself caught, physically and emo-
tionally, in the movement; another lawyer, William Stapleton, was
fright- ened into the captaincy of a rebel division at Beverley; Lord
Darcy of Templehurst, an ardent Catholic, lent the revolt his secret
support; two Percys joined, and most of the northern nobility followed
suit. On October 1 5, 1536, the main army of some 9,000 men, under Aske,
laid siege to York. The citizens of the city compelled the mayor to open
the gates. Aske kept his men from pillage, and in general maintained
remarkable order in his un- trained host. He proclaimed the reopening of
the monasteries; the monks joyfully returned to them, and gladdened the
hearts of the pious with the new ardor of their chants. Aske advanced
and captured Pomfret, and Staple- ton took Hull, without shedding blood.
To the demands presented by the Lincolnshire men others were added and
sent to the King: to suppress all heretics and their literature, to
resume ecclesiastical ties with Rome, to legitimize Mary, to dismiss and
punish Cromwell’s visitors, and to annul all enclosures of common lands
since 1489.</p>
<p>This was the most critical point in Henry’s reign. Half the country
was in arms against his policies; Ireland was in revolt; and Paul III
and Cardinal Pole were urging Francis I and Charles V to invade England
and depose the King. With a last burst of his declining energy, he sent
out orders in all directions for the mustering of loyal troops, and
meanwhile instructed the Duke of Norfolk to bemuse the rebellious
leaders with negotiations. The Duke arranged a conference with Aske and
several nobles, and won them over by a promise of pardon to all. Henry
invited Aske to a personal con- ference, and gave him a safe-conduct. He
came to the King, was charmed by the aura of royalty, and returned meek
and unharmed to Yorkshire (Janu- ary 1537); there, however, he was
arrested, and was sent to London as a prisoner. Shorn of its captains,
the insurgent host fell into angry divisions and wild disorder;
defections multiplied; and as the united levies of the King approached,
the rebel army disappeared like a vanishing mirage (February 1537 )-</p>
<p>When Henry was assured that the revolt and invasion had both
collapsed, he repudiated Norfolk’s promise of a general pardon, ordered
the arrest of such disaffected leaders as could be found, and had
several of them, includ- ing Aske, put to death. To the Duke he
wrote:</p>
<p>Our pleasure is that before you close up our banner again you
shall</p>
<p>cause such dreadful execution to be done upon a good number of
the</p>
<p>5&lt;*7</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) HENRY VIII AND THE MONASTERIES</p>
<p>inhabitants of every town, village, and hamlet that have offended, as
they may be a fearful spectacle to all others hereafter that would</p>
<p>practice any like matter. . . . Forasmuch as all these troubles
have</p>
<p>ensued by the solicitation and traitorous conspiracies of the
monks</p>
<p>and canons of these parts, we desire you, at such places as have con-
spired and kept their houses with force . . . you shall, without pity or
circumstance, cause all the monks and canons that be in any wise</p>
<p>faulty to be tied up without further delay or ceremony. 14</p>
<p>With the opposition so sternly terrified, Cromwell proceeded to close
the remaining religious houses in England. All the monasteries and
nunneries that had joined the revolt were dissolved forthwith, and their
property was confiscated to the state. Visitations were extended, and
yielded reports of indiscipline, immorality, treason, and decay. Many
monks, anticipating closure, sold relics and valuables from their houses
to the highest bidder; a finger of St. Andrew fetched £40. 15 The monks
at Walsingham were con- victed of faking miracles, and their lucrative
image of the Virgin was cast into the fire. The historic tomb of
St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury was demolished; Henry VIII proclaimed
the victor over Henry II to have been no real saint; the relics that had
offended Colet and amused Erasmus were burned; the precious objects
donated by the piety of pilgrims during 250 years were carted away to
the royal treasury ( 1538) ; and thereafter Henry wore on his thumb a
great ruby taken from the shrine. Some monasteries sought to fool fate
by sending Cromwell money or gifts; Cromwell accepted everything and
closed all. By 1540 all monasteries, and all monastic property except
cathedral abbey churches, had passed to the King.</p>
<p>All in all 578 monasteries were closed, some 1 30 convents; 6,52 1
monks or friars were dispersed, 1,360 nuns. Among these some fifty monks
and two nuns willingly abandoned the religious habit; but many more
pleaded to be allowed to continue somewhere their conventual life. 16
Some 12,000 persons formerly employed by, or dependent upon, the
religious houses lost their places or alms. The confiscated lands and
buildings had enjoyed an annual revenue of some £ 200,000 (0,000,000?),
but quick sales reduced the annual income of the properties after
nationalization to some £37,000. To this should be added £ 83,000 in
confiscated precious metal, so that the total spoils in goods and income
accruing to Henry during his life may have been some £ 1,423, 5oo.
17</p>
<p>The King was generous with these spoils. Some of the properties he
gave — most of them he sold at bargain prices — to minor nobles or major
burgesses — merchants or lawyers — who had supported or administered his
policies. Cromwell received or bought six abbeys, with an annual revenue
of £ 2,293; his nephew Sir Richard Cromwell received seven, with an
income of £2,- 35 2 ; 18 this was the orig in of the fortune that made
Richard’s great -grandson</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>568</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>Oliver a man of substance and influence in the next century. Some of
the spoils went to build ships, forts, and ports; some helped to finance
war; some went into the royal palaces at Westminster, Chelsea, and
Hampton Court; some the King lost at dice. 18 Six monasteries were
returned to the Anglican Church as episcopal sees; and a small sum was
assigned to continue the most urgent of the charities formerly provided
by the monks and nuns. The new aristocracy created by Henry’s gifts and
sales became a powerful support to the Tudor throne, and a bulwark of
economic interest against any Cath- olic restoration. The old feudal
aristocracy had decimated itself; the new one, rooted in commerce and
industry, changed the nature of the English nobility from static
conservatism to dynamic enterprise, and poured fresh blood and energy
into the upper classes of England. This — and the spoils — may have been
one source of the Elizabethan exuberance.</p>
<p>The effects of the dissolution were complex and interminable. The
liber- ated monks may have shared modestly or not in the increase of
England’s population from about 2,500,000 in 1485 to some 4,000,000 in
1547 . 20 A tem- porary increase in the unemployed helped to depress the
earnings of the lower classes for a generation, and the new landlords
proved more grasping than the old. 21 Politically the effect was to
augment still further the power of the monarchy; the Church lost the
last stronghold of resistance. Morally the results were a growth of
crime, pauperism, and beggary, and a dimin- ished provision of charity.
22 Over a hundred monastic hospitals were closed; a few were
rehabilitated by municipal authorities. The sums that fearful or
reverent souls had bequeathed to priests as insurance against infernal
or purgatorial fire were confiscated in expectation that no harm would
come to the dead; 2,374 chantries, with their endowments for Masses,
were appro- priated by the King. 23 The severest effects were in
education. The convents had provided schools for girls, the monasteries
and the chantry priests had maintained schools and ninety colleges for
boys; all these institutions were dissolved.</p>
<p>Having stated the facts as impartially as unconscious prejudice
allowed, the historian may be permitted to add a confessedly
hypothetical comment. Henry’s greed and Cromwell’s ruthlessnes s merely
advanced by a genera- tion an inevitable lessening in the number and
influence of English mon - asteries. These had once done admirable work
in education, charity, and hospital care, but the secularization of such
functions was proceeding throughout Western Europe, even where
Catholicism prevailed. The de- cline in religious fervor and
other-worldliness was rapidly narrowing the flow of novices into
conventual establishments; and many of these were reduced to so small a
number as seemed out of proportion to the splendor of their buildings
and the income of their lands. It is a pity that the situation was met
by the brusque haste of Cromwell rather than by Wolsey’s humane</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) HENRY VIII AND THE MONASTERIES 569</p>
<p>and sounder plan of transforming more and more monasteries into
colleges. Henry’s procedure here, as in his quest for a son, was worse
than his aim. It was good that an end should be put, in some measure, to
the exploitation of simple piety by pious fraud. Our chief regrets go to
the nuns who for the most part labored dutifully in prayer, schooling,
and benevolence; and even one who cannot share their trustful faith must
be grateful that their like again minister, with lifelong devotion, to
the needs of the sick and the poor.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE OBSTINATE IRISH: I3OO-1558</li>
</ol>
<p>The English kings justified their domination of Ireland on the ground
that a hostile Continental power might at any moment use that verdant
island for a flank attack upon England; and this consideration,
seconding the love of power, became more active when Protestant England
failed to win Ireland from the Roman Church. The Irish people, heroic
and anarchic, virile and violent, poeti- cally gifted and politically
immature, resisted, every day, their subjection to an alien blood and
speech.</p>
<p>The evils of the English occupation mounted. Under Edward III many
Anglo-Irish landowners returned to England to live there in ease on
Irish rents; and though the English Parliament repeatedly denounced this
practice, “ab - sentee landlordism” rose through three centuries to be a
leading spur to Irish revolts. Englishmen who remained in Ireland tended
to marry Irish girls, and were gradually absorbed into Irish blood and
ways. Anxious to dam this racial drain, the Irish Parliament, dominated
by English residents and influence, passed the famous Statute of
Kilkenny (1366), which, along with some wise and generous provisions,
forbade intermarriage, fosterage, or other intimate relations between
the English and the Irish in Ireland, and any use, by the English, of
Irish speech, customs, or dress, on pain of imprisonment and forfeiture
of property. No Irishman was henceforth to be received into any English
religious organization; and no Irish bards or storytellers were to enter
English homes. 24 These prohibitions failed; the roses in Irish cheeks
outshone the majesty of the law, and racial fusion went on in that
narrow March, Border, or Pale where alone the English in Ireland dared
to dwell.*</p>
<p>During the Wars of the Roses Ireland might have expelled the English
had the Irish chiefs united, but they preferred fraternal strife,
sometimes encouraged thereto by English gold. Henry VII re-established
English authority in the Pale, and his lord deputy, Sir Edward Poynings,
pushed through the Irish Parliament the humiliating “Poynings’ Law”
(1494)— that in future no Irish Parliament should be convened until all
bills to be presented to it had been approved by the king and privy
council of England. So emasculated, the Eng- lish government in Ireland
became the most incompetent, ruthless, and corrupt</p>
<p>In 1500 the Pale was confined to half the counties of Dublin. Meath,
and Louth, and a portion of Kildare^</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>in Christendom. Its favorite device was to appoint one of the sixty
Irish chieftains as deputy to the viceroy, and commission him to buy or
subdue the rest. Gerald, eighth Earl of Kildare, so appointed, made some
progress in this direction, and mitigated the intertribal lawlessness
that helped English exactions to keep Ireland weak and poor. On his
death ( 1 5 1 3 ) his son Gerald Fitzgerald was named to succeed him as
deputy. This ninth Earl of Kildare had a career typical of the Irish
lords. Accused of conspiring with the Earl of Desmond to let a French
force land in Ireland, he was summoned to England and committed to the
Tower. On his promise faithfully to aid the English cause, Henry VIII
released him and reappointed him deputy. Soon he was charged with
maladministration. He was again brought to England, and again sent to
the Tower, where he died within the year (1534). His devoted son,
“Silken Thomas” Fitzgerald, at once declared war on the English; he
fought bravely and recklessly for fourteen months, was overcome, and was
hanged (1537).</p>
<p>By this time Henry VIII had completed his divorce from the Roman
Church. With characteristic audacity he bade the Irish Parliament
acknowledge him head of the Church in Ireland as well as in England. It
did. An oath accepting his ecclesiastical supremacy was required of all
governmental officials in Ireland, and all church tithes were henceforth
to be paid to the King. Reformers en- tered the churches in the Pale,
and demolished religious relics and images. All monasteries but a remote
few were closed, their property was taken by the government, their monks
were dismissed with pensions if they made no fuss. Some of the spoils
were distributed among the Irish chieftains; so oiled, most of them
accepted titles of nobility from the English King, acknowledged his
religious supremacy, and abjured the pope (1539). 25 The clan system was
abolished, and Ireland was declared a kingdom, with Henry as king
(1541).</p>
<p>Henry was victorious, but mortal; he died within five years of his
triumph. Catholicism in Ireland survived. The chieftains took their
apostasy as a passing incident in politics; they continued to be
Catholics (as Henry did) except for ignoring the pope; and the priests
whose ministrations they supported and re- ceived remained quietly
orthodox. The faith of the people underwent no change; or rather it took
on new vigor because it maintained the pride of nationality against a
schismatic king and, later, a Protestant queen. The struggle for freedom
became more intense than before, since now it spoke for body and
soul.</p>

<li>EVERY OUNCE A KING</li>
</ol>
<p>Henry in 1540 was the most absolute monarch that England had ever
known. The old Norman nobility, whose ancestors had checked even Wil-
liam the Conqueror, were now timidly obedient, and almost forgot the
Magna Charta of their prerogatives. The new nobility, enriched by com-
merce and endowed by the King, served as a barrier to aristocratic or
reli- gious revolts. The House of Commons, once the jealous protector of

<p>liberties but now hand-picked by agents of the King, yielded to him
almost unprecedented powers: the right to confiscate property, to name
anyone his successor, to determine orthodoxy and heresy, to send men to
death after only a mock trial, and to issue proclamations that were to
have the authority of acts of Parliament. “In Henry’s reign the English
spirit of independence burned low in its socket, and love of freedom
grew cold.” 26 The English people accepted this absolutism partly
through featr, partly because it seemed the alternative to another War
of the Roses. Order was more important than liberty.</p>
<p>The same alternatives persuaded Englishmen to suffer Henry’s
ecclesias - tical supremacy. With Catholics and Protestants ready to fly
at each other’s throats, with Catholic citizens, ambassadors, and
potentates conspiring against him almost to invasion, Henry believed
that order could be secured in the religious life of England only by
royal determination of faith and ritual; implicitly he accepted the case
that the Church had made for au- thority in religion. He tried to
dictate who should read the Bible. When the bishops suppressed Tyndale’s
translation he bade them prepare a better one ; when they dallied too
long he allowed Cromwell to commission a new trans- lation by Miles
Coverdale. This first complete British version appeared in Zurich in
1535. In i539arevised edition was printed, and Cromwell ordered this
“Great Bible” placed in every English church. Henry, “of the royal
liberality and goodness,” granted the citizens the privilege of reading
the Bible in their homes; and soon it became a daily influence in nearly
every English family. But it was a fountain of discord as well as of
inspiration; every village sprouted amateur exegetes who proved anything
or its oppo- site by Scripture; fanatics wrangled over it in churches,
and came to blows over it in taverns. 27 Some ambitious men gave their
wives writs of divorce, or kept two wives at once, on the plea that this
was sound Biblical practice. 28 The King regretted the liberty of
reading that he had allowed, and reverted to the Catholic stand. In 1
543 he induced Parliament to rule that only nobles and property owners
might legally possess the Bible, and only priests might preach on it, or
discuss it publicly. 29</p>
<p>It was difficult for the people — even for the King — to know the
King’s mind. Catholics continued to go to the stake or the block for
denying his ecclesiastical supremacy, Protestants for questioning
Catholic theology. Prior Forest of the Observant Franciscans at
Greenwich, who refused to disown the pope, was suspended in chains over
a fire, and was slowly roasted to death (May 31, 1537). 30 John Lambert,
a Protestant, was arrested for denying the Real Presence of Christ in
the Eucharist; he was tried by Henry himself, was by Henry condemned to
die, and was burned at Smithfield (November 16, 1538). Under the growing
influence of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, Henry veered more
and more toward orthodoxy.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>57 *</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>In 1539 King, Parliament, and Convocation, by the “Act of the Six
Articles,” proclaimed the Roman Catholic position on the Real Presence,
clerical celibacy, monastic vows, Masses for the dead, the necessity of
auricular confession to-a priest, and the sufficiency of communion in
one kind. Who- ever, by spoken or written word, denied the Real Presence
should suffer death by burning, without opportunity to abjure, confess,
and be absolved; whoever denied any of the other articles should for the
first offense forfeit his property, for the second his life. All
marriages hitherto contracted by priests were declared void, and for a
priest thereafter to retain his wife was to be a felony. 81 The people,
still orthodox, generally approved these Arti- cles, but Cromwell did
his best to moderate them in practice; and in 1540 the King, tacking
again, ordered prosecution under the Act to cease. Never- theless
Bishops Latimer and Shaxton, who disapproved of the Articles, were
deposed and jailed. On July 30, 1540, three Protestants and three
Catholic priests suffered death at Smithfield in unwilling unison, the
Protestants for questioning some Catholic doctrines, the Catholics for
rejecting the ecclesi- astical sovereignty of the King. 82</p>
<p>Henry was as forceful in administration as in theology. Though he
main- tained an extravagant court, and spent much time in eating, he
toiled heavily in the tasks of government. He chose competent aides as
ruthless as himself. He reorganized the army, equipped it with new
weapons, and studied the latest fashions in tactics and strategy. He
built the first permanent royal navy, which cleared the coasts and
Channel of pirates and prepared for the naval victories of Elizabeth.
But he taxed his people to the limit of tolerance, repeatedly debased
the currency, confiscated private property on flimsy pretexts, demanded
“contributions,” repudiated his debts, borrowed from the Fuggers, and
promoted the English economy in the hope that it would yield him added
revenue.</p>
<p>Agriculture was in depression. Serfdom was still widespread.
Enclosures for sheep pasturage continued; and the new landlords,
unhindered by feudal traditions, doubled or quadrupled the rents of
their tenants on the ground of rising prices, and refused to renew
expiring leases. “Thousands of dis - possessed tenants made their way to
London, and clamored at the doors of the courts of law for redress which
they could not obtain.” 83 Catholic More drew a pitiful picture of the
beggared peasantry, 84 and Protestant Latimer denounced the “rent -
raiser steplords,” and, like Luther, idealized a Catholic past when “men
were full of pity and compassion.” 88 Parliament laid fero - cious
penalties upon vagabondage and beggary. By an act of 1530-31 any able-
bodied mendicant, whether man or woman, was to be “tied to the end of a
cart naked, and be beaten with whips throughout the town till his body
be bloody”; for a second offense an ear was to be cut off; for a third,
another</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) HENRY VIII AND THE MONASTERIES 573</p>
<p>placed peasants found work in the cities, and poor relief mildly
mitigated pauperism. In the end the productivity of the land was raised
by large-scale farming, but the inability of the government to ease the
transition was a criminal and heartless failure of statesmanship.</p>
<p>The same government protected industry with tariffs, and
manufacturers profited from the cheap labor made available by the
migration of peasants to the towns. Capitalistic methods reorganized the
textile industry, and raised a new class of wealthy men to stand beside
the merchants in support of the King; cloth now replaced wool as
England’s chief export. Most ex - ports were of necessaries produced by
the lower classes; most imports were of luxuries available only to the
rich. 87 Commerce and industry were bene- fited by a law of 1536
legalizing interest rates of 10 per cent; and the rapid rise of prices
favored enterprise while it penalized workers, peasants, and old-style
feudal lords. Rents rose 1,000 per cent between 1500 and 1576; 38 food
prices rose 250 to 300 per cent; wages rose 150 per cent. 39 “Such
poverty reigneth now,” wrote Thomas Starkey about 1537, “that in no case
may stand with a very true and flourishing common weal.” 40 Guild mem -
bers found some relief in the insurance and mutual aid provided them
against poverty and fire; but in 1 545 Henry confiscated the property of
the guilds. 41</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE DRAGON RETIRES</li>
</ol>
<p>What sort of a man was this ogre of a king? Holbein the Younger,
coming to England about 1536, painted portraits of Henry and Jane
Seymour. The gorgeous costume almost conceals the royal corpulence; the
gems and ermine, the hand on the jeweled sword, reveal the pride of
authority, the vanity of the uncontradicted male; the broad fat face
bespeaks a hearty sensualism; the nose is a pillar of strength; the
tight lips and stern eyes warn of a despot quick to anger and cold to
cruelty. Henry was now forty-six, at the top of his political curve, but
entering physical decline. He was destined to marry thrice again, and
yet to have no further progeny. From all his six wives he had but three
children who outlived infancy. One of these three — Edward VI — was
sickly and died at fifteen; Mary remained desolately bar- ren in
marriage; Elizabeth never dared marry, probably through conscious- ness
of some physical impediment. The curse of semi-sterility or bodily
defect lay upon the proudest dynasty in English history.</p>
<p>Henry’s mind was keen, his judgment of men was penetrating, his
courage and will power were immense. His manners were coarse, and his
scruples disappeared with his youth. To his friends, however, he
remained kind and generous, jovially amiable, and capable of winning
affection and devotion. Born to royalty, he was surrounded from birth
with obeisance and flattery;</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>(chap. XXV</p>
<p>only a few men dared withstand him, and they were buried without
their heads. “Surely,” wrote More from the Tower, “it is a great pity
that any Christian prince should by a flexible 〔knee-bending〕 council
ready to follow his affections 〔desires〕, and by a weak clergy … be
with flattery so shame- fully abused.” 42 This was the external source
of Henry’s retrogression in character — that the absence of resistance
to his will, after the death of More, made him as flabby in moral sense
as in physique. He was not more lax in sex than Francis I, and after the
passing of Anne Boleyn he seems to have been more monogamous, seriatim,
than Charles V ; sexual looseness was not his worst failing. He was
greedy for money as well as for power, and seldom allowed considerations
of humanity to halt his appropriations. His ungrate- ful readiness to
kill women whom he had loved, or men who, like More and Cromwell, had
served him loyally for many years, is despicable; yet in result he was
not one tenth as murderous as the well-meaning Charles IX sanction- ing
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or Charles V condoning the sack of
Rome, or German princes fighting through thirty years for their right to
determine the religious beliefs of their subjects.</p>
<p>The inner source of his deterioration was the repeated frustration of
his will in love and parentage. Long disappointed in his hope for a son,
dis- honestly checked in his reasonable request for an annulment of his
first mar- riage, deceived (he believed) by the wife for whom he had
risked his throne, bereaved so soon of the only wife who gave him an
heir, tricked into mar- riage by a woman utterly alien to him in
language and temperament, cuck- olded (he thought) by the wife who
seemed to promise him at last the happiness of a home — here was a king
possessing all England but denied the domestic joys of the simplest
husband in his realm. Suffering intermittent agony from an ulcer in his
leg, buffeted with revolts and crises throughout his reign, forced at
almost every moment to arm against invasion, betrayal, and assassination
— how could such a man develop normally, or avoid degen- eration into
suspicion, craft, and cruelty? And how shall we, who fret at the
pinpricks of private tribulation, understand a man who bore in his mind
and person the storm and stress of the English Reformation, weaned his
people by perilous steps from a deeply rooted loyalty, and yet must have
felt in his divided soul an erosive wonder — had he freed a nation or
shattered Christendom?</p>
<p>Danger, as well as power, was the medium in which he lived. He could
never tell how far his enemies would go, or when they would succeed. In
1538 he ordered the arrest of Sir Geoffrey Pole, brother to Reginald.
Fear- ing torture, Geoffrey confessed that he, another brother, Lord
Montague, Sir Edward Neville, and the Marquis and Marchioness of Exeter
had had treasonable correspondence with the Cardinal. Geoffrey was
pardoned; Exeter, Montague, and several others were hanged and quartered
(1538-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXV) HENRY VIII AND THE MONASTERIES 575</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li>; Lady Exeter was imprisoned; and the Countess of Salisbury, mother
of the Poles, was placed under guard. When the Cardinal visited Charles
V in Toledo (1539), bearing a futile request from Paul III that the
Emperor would join with Francis in outlawing all commerce with England,
48 Henry retaliated by arresting the Countess, who was now seventy years
old; per- haps he hoped that by keeping her in the Tower he could check
the Cardi- nal’s enthusiasm for invasion. All was fair in the game of
life and death.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having remained for two years unmarried, Henry bade Cromwell seek for
him a marital alliance that would strengthen his hand against Charles.
Cromwell recommended Anne, sister-in-law of the Elector of Saxony, and
sister of the Duke of Cleves, who was then at odds with the Emperor.
Crom- well set his heart on the marriage, by which he hoped ultimately
to form a league of Protestant states, and thereby compel Henry to
repeal the anti- Lutheran Six Articles. Henry dispatched Holbein to
paint a likeness of the lady; possibly Cromwell added some instructions
to the artist; the picture came, and Henry judged the Princess bearable.
She looks discouragingly sad in the Holbein portrait that hangs in the
Louvre, but not less plain of feature than the Jane Seymour who had for
a moment softened the heart of the King. When Anne came in body, and
Henry laid eyes on her (January 1, 1540), love died at first sight. He
shut his eyes, married her, and prayed again for a son to strengthen the
Tudor succession now that Prince Edward was revealing his physical
frailty. But he never forgave Cromwell.</p>
<p>Four months later, alleging malfeasance and corruption, he ordered
the arrest of his most profitable minister. Hardly anyone objected;
Cromwell was the most unpopular subject in England — for his origin, his
methods, his venality, his wealth. In the Tower he was required to sign
statements im- pugning the validity of the new marriage. Henry announced
that he had not given his “inward consent” to the union, and had never
consummated it. Anne, confessing that she was still a maid, agreed to an
annulment in return for a comfortable pension. Loath to face her
brother, she chose a lonely life in England; and it was small comfort to
her that when she died (1557) she was buried in Westminster Abbey.
Cromwell was beheaded on July 28, I54 °’</p>
<p>On the same day Henry married Catherine Howard, twenty years old, of
a strictly Catholic house; the Catholic party was gaining. The King
ceased to flirt with Continental Protestants, and made his peace with
the Emperor. Feeling himself at last safe in that quarter, he turned his
fancy northward in the hope of annexing Scotland and thereby rounding
out the geographical boundaries and security of Britain. He was
distracted by another rebellion in the north of England. Before leaving
to suppress it, and to discourage conspiracy at his back, he ordered all
the political prisoners in the Tower, including the Countess of
Salisbury, to be put to death (1541). The rebel-</p>
<p>57 6 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>lion collapsed, and Henry, distraught with cares, returned to Hampton
Court to seek solace from his new Queen.</p>
<p>The second Catherine was the fairest of his mates. More dependent
than before on wifely ministrations, the King learned almost to love
her, and he gave thanks to God for “the good life he was leading and
hoped to lead” under her supervision. But on the day after this Te Deum
(November 2,</p>
<p>1541), Archbishop Cranmer handed him documents indicating that
Cather- ine had had premarital relations with three successive suitors.
Two of these confessed; so did the Queen. Henry “took such grief,” the
French ambas - sador reported, “that it was thought he had gone mad”; 44
the fear haunted him that God had cursed all his marriages. He was
inclined to pardon Cath- erine, but evidence was given him that she had,
since her royal marriage, committed adultery with her cousin. She
admitted having received her cousin in her private apartment late at
night, but only in the presence of Lady Rochford; she denied any misdeed
then or at any time since her mar- riage; and Lady Rochford testified to
the truth of these statements so far as her own knowledge went. 45 But
the royal court pronounced the Queen guilty; and on February 13, 1542,
she was beheaded on the same spot where Anne Boleyn’s head had fallen
six years before. Her paramours were sen - tenced to fife
imprisonment.</p>
<p>The King was now a broken man. His ulcer baffled the medical science
of his time, and syphilis, never quite cured, was spreading its ravages
through his frame. 46 Losing the zest of life, he had allowed himself to
become an un- wieldly mass of flesh, his cheeks overlapping his jaws,
his narrowed eyes half lost in the convolutions of his face. He could
not walk from one room to another without support. Realizing that he had
not many years to live, he issued (1543) a new decree fixing the
succession to his throne: first on Edward, then on Mary, then on
Elizabeth; he went no further, for next in line was Mary Stuart of
Scotland. In a final effort to beget a healthy son, and after repeated
urging from his Council, he married a sixth wife (July 1 2,</p>
<p>1543). Catherine Parr had survived two previous husbands, but the
King no longer insisted on virgins. She was a woman of culture and tact;
she nursed her royal invalid patiently, reconciled him with his
long-neglected daughter Elizabeth, and tried to soften his theology and
his persecuting zeal.</p>
<p>Theological bonfires continued to the end of the reign: twenty-six
persons were burned for heresy in its final eight years. In 1543 spies
reported to Bishop Gardiner that Henry Filmer had said, “If God is
really present 〔in the consecrated Host〕, then in my lifetime I have
eaten twenty gods”; that Robert Testwood, at the elevation of the Host,
had jocularly warned the priest not to let God fall; and that Anthony
Pierson had called any priest a thief who preached anything but “the
Word of God”— i.e., the Scriptures. All these men, by the Anglican
Bishop’s orders, were burned in a meado w</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) HENRY VIII AND THE MONASTERIES 577</p>
<p>before the royal palace at Windsor. The King was disturbed to find
that the evidence given by a witness in these cases was perjury; the
culprit was sent to the Tower. 47 In 1 546 Gardiner condemned four more
to the stake for denying the Real Presence. One was a young woman, Anne
Askew, who kept to her heresy through five hours of questioning. “That
which you call your God,” she said at her trial, “is a piece of bread;
for proof thereof let it lie in a box three months, and it will be
moldy.” She was tortured till nearly dead to elicit from her the names
of other heretics; she remained silent in her agony, and went to her
death, she said, “as merry as one that is bound toward heaven.” 48 The
King was not active in these persecutions, but the victims appealed to
him without result.</p>
<p>In 1543 he fell into war with Scotland and his “beloved brother”
Francis I, and soon found himself allied with his old enemy Charles V.
To finance his campaigns he demanded new “loans” from his subjects,
repudiated pay - ment on the loans of 1542, and confiscated the
endowments of the univer- sities. 49 He was carried to the war in
person, and supervised the siege and capture of Boulogne. His armies
invaded Scotland and wrecked the abbeys of Melrose and Dryburgh, and
five other monasteries, but were routed at Ancrum Moor ( 1 545 ) . A
profitable accord was signed with France ( 1 546) , and the King could
die in peace.</p>
<p>He was now so weak that noble families openly contended as to which
should have the regency for young Edward. A poet, the Earl of Surrey,
was so confident that his father, the Duke of York, would be regent that
he adopted a coat of arms suitable only to an heir-apparent to the
throne. Henry arrested both; they confessed their guilt; the poet was
beheaded on January 9, 1547, and the Duke was scheduled for execution
soon after the twenty- seventh. But on the twenty-eighth the King died.
He was fifty-five years old, but he had lived a dozen lives in one. He
left a large sum to pay for Masses for the repose of his soul.</p>
<p>The thirty-seven years of his reign transformed England more deeply
than perhaps he imagined or desired. He thought to replace the pope
while leaving unchanged the old faith that had habituated the people to
moral re- straints and obedience to law; but his successful defiance of
the papacy, his swift dispersal of monks and relics, his repeated
humiliation of the clergy, his appropriation of Church property, and his
secularization of the govern- ment so weakened ecclesiastical prestige
and authority as to invite the theo- logical changes that followed in
the reigns of Edward and Elizabeth. The English Reformation was less
doctrinal than the German, but one outstand- ing result was the same —
the victory of the state over the Church. The peo- ple escaped from an
infallible pope into the arms of an absolute king.</p>
<p>In a material sense they had not benefited. They paid church tithes
as</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>before, but the net surplus went to the government. Many peasants now
tilled their tenancies for “steplords” more ruthless than the abbots
whom Carlyle was to idealize in Past and Present. William Cobbett
thought that “viewed merely in its social aspect, the English
Reformation was in reality the rising of the rich against the poor.” 60
Records of prices and wages indi - cate that the agricultural and town
workers were better off at Henry’s accession than at his death . 51</p>
<p>The moral aspects of the reign were bad. The King gave the nation a
demoralizing example in his sexual indulgence, his callous passing in a
few days from the execution of one wife to the bed of the next, his calm
cruelty, fiscal dishonesty, and material greed. The upper classes
disordered the court and government with corrupt intrigues; the gentry
emulated Henry in grasping at the wealth of the Church; the
industrialists mulcted their work- ers and were mulcted by the King. The
decay of charity did not complete the picture, for there remained the
debasing subserviency of a terrified peo- ple to a selfish autocrat.
Only the courage of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs redeemed the
scene, and Fisher and More, the noblest of them, had persecuted in their
turn.</p>
<p>In a large perspective even those bitter years bore some good fruit.
The Reformation had to be; we must repeatedly remind ourselves of this
while we record the deviltry of the century that gave it birth. The
break with the past was violent and painful, but only a brutal blow
could shake its grip on the minds of men. When that incubus was removed,
the spirit of nationalism, which at first permitted despotism, became a
popular enthusiasm and a creative force. The elimination of the papacy
from English affairs left the people for a time at the mercy of the
state; but in the long run it compelled them to rely on themselves in
checking their rulers and claiming, decade after decade, a measure of
freedom commensurate with their intelligence. The government would not
always be as powerful as under Henry the Terrible; it would be weak
under a sickly son and an embittered daughter; then, under a vacillating
but triumphant queen, the nation would rise in a burst of liberated
energy, and lift itself to the leadership of the European mind. Perhaps
Elizabeth and Shakespeare could not have been had not Eng- land been set
free by her worst and strongest king.</p>
