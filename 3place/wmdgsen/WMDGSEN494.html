<h4 id="chapter-xxii-voltaire-and-christianity">CHAPTER XXII Voltaire
and Christianity</h4>
<p>1734-78</p>
<p>I. VOLTAIRE AND GOD</p>
<p>W E may study later the nonreligious activities, opinions, and
interests of that consuming fire called Voltaire, burning fitfully at
Ferney;</p>
<p>here we summarize only his views on religion and his war against
Chris- tianity. We shall say nothing about him that has not been said a
hundred times before; and he said nothing about Christianity that had
not been said before. It is only that when he said it the words passed
like a flame through Europe, and became a force molding his time, and
ours.</p>
<p>It was natural that he should question the Christian creed, for a
religion is intended to quiet rather than excite the intellect, and
Voltaire was in- tellect incarnate, unquiet and unappeased. We have seen
him in his career joining the skeptical wits of the Temple, nourishing
his doubts among the deists of England, pursuing science at Cirey, and
exchanging infidelities with Frederick in Germany. Yet, until he was
fifty-six, he kept his un- belief as an incidental expression or private
sport, and made no open war upon the Church. On the contrary, he
publicly and repeatedly defended the fundamentals of the Christian faith
— a just God, free will, and immortal- ity. Unless we account him a liar
(which he often was), he retained till death his belief in God and in
the value of religion. We may quote him to almost any purpose, for, like
every living thing, he grew and changed and decayed; which of us
retained at fifty the views he held at twenty, or, at seventy, the views
he held at fifty? Voltaire contradicted himself endlessly because he
lived long and wrote much; his opinions were the fluent vision of his
mounting years. 1</p>
<p>At Cirey, about 1734, he tried to formulate his ideas on first and
last things in a Traite de metaphysique. Years before Paley made the
compari- son familiar to Englishmen, Voltaire submitted that it was as
logical to postulate an intelligent mind in the universe as to suppose
that a watch- maker had made a watch; in either case he saw evidence of
design in the adaptation of specific means to particular ends. But just
as the watch, though designed by intelligence, operates according to
fixed laws, so does</p>
<p>7G</p>
<p>7i 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>he universe; there are no miracles. Yet somehow he could not throw
off the feeling that the human will is in some mysterious way and modest
de- gree free, though he knew well that free volitions acting upon a
mechanical world must upset its mechanism. Mind is a form and function
of matter; “we ought to judge,” said Voltaire, following Locke, “that it
is quite pos - sible for God to add thought to matter”; 2 that matter
should think is no greater miracle than it would be for an immaterial
mind to act upon a material body. The soul is merely the life of the
body, and dies with it. There is no other divine revelation than nature
itself; this is enough, and inexhaustible. There may be some good in
religion, but an intelligent man does not need it as a support to
morality; too often, in history, it has been used by priests to bemuse
the public mind while kings picked the public pocket. Virtue should be
defined in terms of social good rather than obedi- ence to God, and it
should not depend upon rewards and punishments after death.</p>
<p>Voltaire read these seventy-five pages to Mme. du Chatelet, who ap-
parently discouraged their publication. He seems to have agreed with
her; he put the manuscript aside, and it was never printed during his
lifetime. Moreover, he became convinced that any rational metaphysics —
any at- tempt by reason to explain the origin, nature, or destiny of the
world and man — would be forever beyond human power. He read the
philosophers, but he did not admire their systems. “In metaphysics and
morals,” he thought, “the ancients have said everything. We always
encounter or re- peat them. All modern books of this description are
merely repetitions.” 3 He must have been impressed by Spinoza’s system,
for he labored to re - fute it.</p>
<p>Despite his disclaimers, he could not still his interest in the
insoluble. From time to time, during the years 1734-56, he delved into
metaphysics and theology. He continued to the end of his life to rest
his belief in God upon the argument from design, though he ridiculed the
excesses of teleol- ogy. “I may not believe that nose s were made as
convenient bridges for spectacles, but I am convinced that they were
made to smell with.” 4 And: “To affirm that the eye is not made to see,
nor the ear to hear, nor the stomach to digest — is not this the most
monstrous absurdity?” 5 When a young author knocked at the door of Les
Delices (1757), and introduced himself to Voltaire as “a young atheist
ready to serve” him, Voltaire re - plied, “And I have the honor to be a
deist employer; but though our pro- fessions are so opposed, I will give
you supper today and work tomorrow; I can make use of your arms, though
not of your head.” 0 He called himself a deist, but he was rather a
theist: that is, his God was not an impersonal force more or less
identical with nature, but a conscious intelligence design- ing and
ruling the world. Generally, after 1750, he called himself a theist;
7</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>717</p>
<p>and in the Philosophical Dictionar y , in the article “Theism,” he
wrote in terms that could justify Condorcet’s description of Voltaire as
“a deeply religious man”:</p>
<p>The theist is a man firmly persuaded of the existence of a
Supreme</p>
<p>Being equally good and powerful, who has formed all… existences; who
punishes crimes without cruelty, and rewards virtuous actions</p>
<p>with kindness. The theist does not know how God punishes, how he
rewards, how he pardons, for he is not presumptuous enough to flatter
himself that he understands how God acts; but he knows that God</p>
<p>acts, and that God is just. The difficulties opposed to a Providence
do not stagger him in his faith, for they are only great difficulties,
not</p>
<p>proofs; he submits himself to that Providence, although he perceives
only some of its effects and some appearances; and, judging of the</p>
<p>hings he does not see by those he sees, he thinks that this
Providence pervades all places and all ages.</p>
<p>United in this principle with all the rest of the universe, he
does</p>
<p>not join any of the sects, who all contradict themselves. His
religion is the most ancient and the most extended, for the simple
adoration of a God has preceded all the systems in the world…. He
believes</p>
<p>hat religion consists neither in the opinions of incomprehensible</p>
<p>metaphysics nor in vain decorations, but in adoration and justice. To
do good is his worship; to submit himself to God is his doctrine….</p>
<p>He laughs at Loreto and Mecca, but he succors the indigent and de-
fends the oppressed. 8</p>
<p>Was Voltaire sincere in these professions? Some students ascribe them
to caution, or to a desire to move to atheism one step at a time , 9 or
to a hope that religious faith inculcated in his servants would lessen
pilferage; and there are passages in Voltaire that seem to justify this
interpretation. (“If you have but a village to govern, it must have a
religion.” 10 ) One of his most quoted remarks appears to reduce
religion to a public utility; but the context of that line puts it in a
fairer light. It occurs in the Epistle to the Author of u The Three
Impostors”:</p>
<p>Si Dieu n’existait pas il fandrait Pinveftter,</p>
<p>Mais tonte la nature nous crie qiCil existed</p>
<p>—“If God did not exist, it would be nec essary to invent him, but all
nature cries out to us that he does exist” and the entire poem is a plea
for belief. Voltaire returns to the theistic argument again and again,
as if to answer his own doubts. In his final decade he wrote as often
against atheism as against orthodoxy. Meanwhile he made war upon the
popular conception of the deity as a God of Vengeance damning most of
mankind to an ever- lasting hell. “The human race would be too unhappy
if it were as common</p>
<p>7*8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>o commit atrocities as to believe in them.” 12 “If God made man in
his own image, we have well repaid him” 13 — by making him in ours;
nothing could better reveal man’s conception of himself than his
conception of God.</p>
<p>Voltaire struggled to reconcile his theism with the existence of
evil. In these efforts at theodicy he came close to the optimism of
Leibniz (which he was to ridicule in Candide ): what is evil from the
standpoint of the part may be good, or at least not evil, in the
perspective of the whole; this is not the best conceivable, but the best
possible, world. 14 “When every - thing is counted and weighed up,” he
wrote to Frederick in 1738, “I think there are infinitely more
enjoyments than bitterness in th is life” 15 — but this was written in
his hale and middle years. He did not believe that man is wicked by
nature; on the contrary, he held that man has an innate sense of
justice, and a bienveillance naturelle — z natural feeling of good will
to- ward other men. 10 There are countless varieties and contradictions
in the moral ideas and customs of mankind, but all peoples, Voltaire
thought, con- demn parricide and fratricide. 17</p>
<p>In 1752, at Potsdam, he composed a poem, La Loi naturelle (published
in 1 756), which summarized his “natural religion.” As it took the form
of a letter to the skeptical Frederick II, it could hardly have been an
attempt to please the pious; but it comes closer to piety and orthodoxy
than any- thing else that Voltaire ever printed. It not only affirms
faith in God the Creator, but describes man’s moral sense as infused
into him by the Deity; 18 here he speaks like Rousseau, and anticipates
the enthusiasm of Kant for the categorical imperative of conscience. He
defines his religion in one line: “ Adore un Dieu, sois juste , et
cheris ta patrie ”’ 9 He surveys the vari - eties of religious belief,
laments their hatreds and fanaticisms, and pleads for mutual toleration
among the creeds. He ends with a prayer that any saint might have
signed. The Paris Parlement ordered the poem to be publicly burned
(January 23, 1759), probably because some lines in it con- demned
Jansenism.</p>
<p>We may conclude that until 1751 — until he was fifty-seven years old
— Voltaire refrained from any outright and public attack upon
Christianity or the Catholic Church. What was it that aroused him to
open war, pre- cisely at an age when most rebels have subsided into
peace? It was the sup- pression of the Encyclopedie, the orthodox
explanations of the Lisbon earthquake, and the ferocious executions of
Jean Calas and the Chevalier de La Barre.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>VOLTAIRE AND THE ENCYCLOPEDIE</li>
</ol>
<p>He was in Potsdam when the first volume of the Encyclopedie was pub-
lished (1751). He must have read with warm pleasure the lines by
which</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 719</p>
<p>d’Alembert had paid homage to him in the “Discours preliminaire”:
“May I not… render to this rare genius the tribute and eulogy that he
merits, which he has so frequently received from his compatriots, from
foreigners, and from his enemies, and to which posterity will add full
measure when he can no longer enjoy the praise?” Voltaire returned the
compliment in a letter of September 5, 1752, to d’Alembert: “You and M.
Dider ot are accomplishing a work which will be the glory of France and
the shame of those who persecute you…. Of eloquent philosophers I
recognize only you and him.” He pledged his support, and lost no
opportunity to call attention to the enterprise as “an immense and
immortal work, which accuses the shortness of human life.” 20</p>
<p>However busy with his own major compositions — Le Siecle de Louis XIV
and Essai sur les moeurs — and embroiled with Hirsch, Maupertuis, and
Frederick, Voltaire found time to send to d’Alembert (1753) some brief
articles “only as material which you will arrange at your pleasure in
the immortal edifice which you are raising. Add, shorten; I give you my
pebbles to insert into some corner of t he wall.” 21 He invoked the aid
of influential friends to protect the editors. In 1755 he wrote to
d’Alembert: “As long as I have a breath of life I am at the service of
the illustrious authors of the Encylopedie. I consider myself greatly
honored to be able to contribute, even feebly, to the greatest and
handsomest monument of the nation and of literature.” 22 With that
letter he enclosed articles on fire, force, fornication, French, genius,
and taste {gout). Examining the first five volumes, he found much to
praise, something to deplore. He asked the editors to require clearness
and brevity of all contributors, and he cautioned d’Alembert (whom he
mistakenly supposed to be chief editor): “You are poorly</p>
<p>seconded; there are bad soldiers in the army of a great general….
I</p>
<p>am sorry to see that the writer of the article “Enfer” declares that
hell was a point in the doctrine of Moses; now, by all the devils, that
is not true.” 23</p>
<p>Soon he sent in several minor articles, and a major disquisition on
his- tory. He persuaded a learned priest of Lausanne, Antoine Noe de
Polier, to write for the Ency clopedie the articles “Magi,” “Magic,”
“Magician,” and “Messiah,” all quietly heretical. We have seen how
Voltaire had some responsibility for d’Alembert’s article on Geneva
(1757); he weathered the ensuing storm by inviting the betrayed
clergymen to dinner. When</p>
<p>disaster threatened the great enterprise (January, 1758) he wrote to
Diderot:</p>
<p>Go on, brave Diderot, intrepid d’ Alembert;… fall upon the</p>
<p>knaves, destroy their empty declamations, their miserable
sophistries, their historical lies, their contradictions and absurdities
beyond num- ber; do not let men of intelligence become the slaves of
those who</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>have none. The new generation will owe to you both reason and</p>
<p>liberty. 24</p>
<p>Diderot made no answer, d’Alembert insisted on withdrawing; Voltaire
himself, losing courage, and offended by Diderot’s silence, decided to
abandon ship. On February 6 or 7 he wrote again to Diderot, asking him
to restore to him his yet unpublished contributions. Diderot replied
that the manuscripts were with d’Alembert; but that if Voltaire should
repeat the request for their return he wou ld “never forget the injury.”
On February 26 Voltaire wrote to d’Argental: “I love M. Diderot, I
respect him, and I am angry.” But to the same on March 12: “If you see
this good man Diderot, tell the poor slave that I pardon him with as
full a heart as I pity him.” 25 In May d’Alembert sent the demanded
articles to Voltaire; in June d’Alembert resumed work for the
Encyclopedic; Voltaire again submitted the articles, but asked that they
be published, if at all, without his name. He proposed that the
enterprise be moved to another country, where it would suffer less
emasculation by censorship actual or feared; Diderot thought the
proposal impracticable. Voltaire lost faith in the value of a mas- sive
and expensive encyclopedia as a vehicle of liberal propaganda. On June
26, 1758, he notified Diderot that other preoccupations would make it
impossible for him to contribute further material; besides, as matters
now stood between the editors, the government, and the Church, “one is
obliged to lie, and we are persecuted if we have not lied enough.” 25
The furor created by Helvetius’ De l’ Esprit (July) frightened the aging
rebel into writing an answer to that book. On November 16 he informed
Diderot that he had bought a house at Ferney, and intended henceforth to
live quietly as a country gentleman.</p>
<p>Was he deceiving himself, or was he planning to resume the war by
other means?</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE THEOLOGY OF EARTHQUAKES</li>
</ol>
<p>While the Encyclopedic was in the throes of repeated deaths and
resur- rections, the Lisbon earthquake sent its tremors throughout
European philosophy. At 9:40 a.m. on All Saints’ Day, November 1, 1755,
the earth</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>7 2I</p>
<p>citizens were attending Mass? And why had he spared, amid the general
ruin, the house of Sebastiao de Carvalho e Mello — the future Marques de
Pombal — the ruling minister who was in all Europe the most fervent
enemy of the Jesuits?</p>
<p>A Portuguese Jesuit, Malagrida, explained that the quake, and the</p>
<p>calamitous tidal wave that had followed it, were God’s punishment for
the vice that had prospered in Lisbon; 27 but were the sinners the only
ones that went to pray in the churches on that awful morning? Why had so
many holy priests and dedicated nuns perished in the quake and the
conflagration? The Moslems would have hailed the catastrophe as Allah’s
revenge upon the Portuguese Inquisition, but the quake had destroyed the
great Mosque of Al-Mansur in Rabat. Some Protestant dominies in London
ascribed the disaster to divine reprobation of Catholic crimes against
humanity; but on November 19 of the same year an earthquake damaged
fifteen hundred houses in Boston, Massachusetts, home of the Pilgrims
and the Puritans. William Warburton announced that the massacre in
Lisbon “displayed God’s glory in its fairest colors.” 28 John Wesley
preached a sermon on “The Cause and Cure of Earthquakes”; “sin,” he
said, “is the moral cause of earthquakes, whatever their natural cause
may be;… they are the effect of that curse which was brought upon the
earth by the original transgression” of Adam and Eve. 29</p>
<p>Voltaire fumed at these explanations, but he himself could find none
to reconcile the event with his faith in a just God. Where now was
Leibniz’ “best of all possible worlds”? Or Pope’s “Whatever is, is
right”— or his pre- tense that “all partial evil” is “universal good”?
30 In an angry reaction against his own early optimism Voltaire composed
(1756) his greatest poem — “On the Lisbon Disaster, or An Examination of
the Axiom ‘AH Is Well.’” Here is our chance to sample at once his
thought and his verse.</p>

<p>But what crime, what fault had those infants committed who lay
crushed and bloody on their mothers’ breasts? Had London or Paris less
vice than Lisbon? Yet Lisbon is shattered, and Paris dances.</p>
<p>Could not an omniscient God have made a world without such meaning-
less suffering? “I respect my God, but I love mankind.”</p>
<p>The poet looks upon the world of life, and sees everywhere, in a
thou- sand forms, a struggle for existence, in which every organism,
sooner or later, is slain. This bitter summary of biology demands a
literal translation:</p>
<p>The ferocious vulture darts upon its timid prey, and feasts with,</p>
<p>joy upon the bleeding limbs. All seems well for him; but soon an
eagle with sharply cutting beak devours the vulture in its turn. Man
reaches the lordly eagle with a deadly shot; and man lies in the dust on
the</p>
<p>battlefield, bloody, pierced with blows, amid a mound of dying men;
there he serves as the frightful food of voracious birds. Thus all
the</p>
<p>world in all its members groans, all born for suffering and for
mutual death. And in this fatal chaos you will compose, from the misery
of</p>
<p>each part, the happiness of the whole! What happiness? Oh, weak and
miserable mortal! You cry out in mournful tones that “all is well”; the
universe gives you the lie, and your own heart refutes a hundred times
the error of your mind. The elements, and animals, and men — all are in
war. Let us confess it: evil strides the earth.</p>
<p>How does this scene of universal strife and ignominious, agonizing
death comport with the belief in a good God? He exists, but he is a

<p>Oh, miserable mortals, grieving earth!</p>

<p>Eternal host of useless sufferings!</p>
<p>Ye silly sages who cry, “All is well,”</p>
<p>Come, contemplate these ruins horrible,</p>

<p>Women and children heaped in common death,</p>
<p>These scattered members under broken shafts;</p>
<p>A hundred thousand luckless by the earth</p>

<p>mystery. He sends his son to redeem mankind, yet the earth and man
re- main the same despite his sacrifice.</p>
<p>What can the farthest-reaching mind say of this? Nothing; the book of
fate is closed to our view. Man, a stranger to himself, is unknown to
man. What am I? Where am I? Whither do I go? Whence did I</p>
<p>come? Atoms tormented on this heap of mud, which death engulfs, and
with which fate plays; yet thinking atoms, atoms whose eyes,</p>
<p>guided by thought, have measured the skies. We throw our minds</p>
<p>across the infinite, yet cannot for one moment see and know
ourselves.</p>
<p>This, of course, is the note that Pascal had sounded a hundred years
before, in prose greater than Voltaire’s verse. Voltaire had once
rejected Pascal; now he echoes his pessimism. From the same premises
Pascal had concluded, Let us surrender ourselves to Christian faith and
hope. Originally Voltaire ended his poem with a somber, stoic
couplet:</p>
<p>Que faut-il, O mortels? Mortels, il faut souffrir,</p>
<p>Se soumettre en silence , adorer, et mourir</p>
<p>—“What must we do, O mortals? Mor tals, we must suffer, submit in
silence, adore, and die.” His friends protested that such a hopeless
ending was un - bearable. He changed the final line to read:</p>
<p>Se soumettre, adorer, esperer, et mourir</p>
<p>—“Submit, adore, hope, and die.” No one was sati sfied; he gave in,
and added twenty-nine lines, yielding himself to Providence, and
trusting that “only God is right.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless the poem shocked not only the orthodox, but the philos-
ophes as well; such a despondent tone seemed to take all the wind out of
philosophic sails. Rousseau sent to Voltaire a long and eloquent letter
ex- plaining that all human ills are the result of human faults; the
Lisbon earth- quake was a just punishment of man for abandoning a
natural life and living in cities; if men had kept to the simple life of
scattered villages and modest homes, there would have been relatively
few victims. We must put our faith in the goodness of God, said Jean
Jacques, for that is the sole alternative to a suicidal pessimism; we
must continue to believe, with Leibniz, that since God has created this
world, everything in it, in the long run and the long view, must be
right. Some printer secured a copy of this letter and published it; it
was widely acclaimed as an able reply to Voltaire’s poem. Voltaire kept
his peace for an unusually long time. When he dealt again with optimism
it was in his most perfect production, a book that in</p>
<p>724 THE AGE 0F VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>a generation went around the world, and that is now the most living
relic and symbol of Voltaire.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>CAND1DE</li>
</ol>
<p>It was published early in 1759 as Candide, ou Voptimisme ,
purportedly “translated from the German of Dr. Ralph, with additio ns
found in the pocket of the Doctor when he died at Minden.” The Great
Council of Geneva almost at once (March 5) ordered it to be burned. Of
course Voltaire denied his authorship; “people must have lost their
senses,” he wrote to a friendly pastor in Geneva, “to attribute to me
that pack of non - sense. I have, thank God, better occupations.” 31 But
France was unanimous: no other man could have written Candide. Here was
that deceptively sim- ple, smoothly flowing, lightly prancing, impishly
ironic prose that only he could write; here and there a little
obscenity, a little scatology; everywhere a playful, darting, lethal
irreverence; if the style is the man, this had to be Voltaire.</p>
<p>It begins innocently, but soon betrays the master’s twinkling
eye:</p>
<p>In the country of Westphalia, in the castle of the most noble
Baron</p>
<p>Thunder-ten-tronckh, lived a youth whom nature had endowed with a
most sweet disposition…. He had a solid judgment joined to the</p>
<p>most unaffected simplicity; and for that reason, I believe, he
was</p>
<p>named Candide. The old servants of the house suspected him to have
been the son of the Baron’s sister, by a good and honorable
gentleman</p>
<p>cause he could produce no more than seventy-one quarterings;</p>
<p>he was inadmissible in marriage, though adequate in bed. The handsome
young bastard is tutored by Professor Pangloss (All-tongue), who</p>
<p>could prove to admiration that there is no effect without a cause,
and that in this best of all possible worlds the Baron’s castle was the
most magnificent of all castles, and Milady the best of possible
baronesses [despite her 350 pounds]. It is demonstrable, said he, that
things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for, as all things have
been created for some end, they must necessarily have been created for
the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles,
therefore</p>
<p>we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings;
ac-</p>
<p>cordingly we wear stockings…. They who assert that everything</p>
<p>is right do not express themselves correctly; they should say
that</p>
<p>everything is best.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 725</p>
<p>Candide “listened attentively, and believed implicitly,” for Mile.
Cune - gonde, the Baron’s daughter, was obviously the best and most
beautiful creature that could possibly have been created. She invites
him to fall in love with her; he falls; the Baron gives him several “
grands coups de pied dans le derriere,” and puts him out of the
castle.</p>
<p>Candide wanders, and is captured by recruiters who impress him into
the Bulgarian (with Voltairean reminiscences of the Prussian) army.</p>
<p>“There he was made to wheel about to the right, to the left, to draw
his rammer, to return his rammer, to present, to fire, to march, and
they gave him thirty blows with a cane.” He sees battle, deserts, and
comes upon Pangloss, who is now minus the end of his nose, and will soon
lose an eye and an ear, as the result of excessive propinquity with the
pretty wench Pacquette, “who was infected with an ailment which she had
received from a learned Cordelier [Franciscan friar], who… had it from
an old countess, who had received it from a captain of cavalry, who owed
it to a marquise, who had it from a page, who had it from a Jesuit, who
had received it from one of the companions of Christopher Columbus.”
32</p>
<p>Candide and Pangloss are shipwrecked near Lisbon, and reach shore
just in time for the earthquake. They survive, but are arrested as
heretics by the Inquisition; Pangloss is hanged; Candide escapes through
the aid of Cunegonde, who, having been raped by soldiers, and then sold
to a Jew, had recently been sold to a leading Inquisitor. Candide and
Cunegonde flee with the help of an old lady, who silences their
complaints by telling how she came near being eaten at the siege of Azor
by the starving Turks among whom she had fallen; but, by the mercy of
half-blind fate, they began by merely cutting off one buttock of each
available woman; the siege ended before any further samplings; “now,”
concludes the old woman, “stop bemoaning your misery, and rejoice that
you can sit on two buttocks.”</p>
<p>They cross the Atlantic in hopes that the New World will be less
cruel than the Old. In Buenos Aires the commandant appropriates
Cunegonde to himself. Candide is banished; he enters the Jesuit colony
in Paraguay, finds th ere Cunegonde’s brother, who attacks him for
daring to think of marry - ing her; Candide kills him, and resumes his
desolate wandering. In a se- cluded Peruvian valley he comes upon El
Dorado, a land where gold is so abundant that no one values it; a land
without money or prisons, or lawyers, or priests, or economic strife;
its happy people live to two</p>
<p>hundred years, and have no religion except a simple worship of one
God. Candide picks up some gold and moves on, still hungering for
Cunegonde. He sails back to Europe, and reaches Portsmouth in time to
see Admiral Byng shot for losing a battle; in this country, says
Candide’s new friend Martin, it is considered wise to kill an admiral
now and then, “ pour en - courager les autres “ — to encourage the
others. 33</p>
<p>726</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Learning that Cunegonde is in Venice, Candide takes ship to Italy. In
Venice he is depressed by learning about the miseries of the
prostitutes. He hears gondoliers singing, and concludes that he has
found some happy men, but Martin checks him:</p>
<p>“You do not see them at home with their wives and their brats</p>
<p>[5 marmots d’enfants ]. The doge has his griefs, the gondoliers have
theirs. It is true that, all in all, the lot of a gondolier is
preferable to</p>
<p>hat of a doge; but I believe the difference is so trifling that it is
not</p>
<p>worth the trouble of examining it.” 34</p>
<p>Cunegonde is not in Venice, she is in Constantinople. Candide hurries
there, finds that she is now an old and ugly slave; nevertheless he
frees her and marries her. Pangloss, having been insufficiently hanged
by the In- quisition, rejoins his pupil and resumes his defense of
optimism. They meet an almost happy man, who entertains them with
home-grown fruits and nuts. “You must have a large estate,” Candide
inquires. “I have only twenty acres,” replies the Turk; “I cultivate
them with my children; our labor keeps away three great evils — boredom,
vice, and need.” 35 Candide decides to do likewise; he, Cunegonde, and
their friends till a plot of ground and grow their own food; the
one-buttock woman, a reformed prostitute, and her friend the friar put
their hands to various tasks; they labor, are tired, eat, are a bit
bored, but moderately content. Pangloss argues that this must be the
best of all possible worlds, since their sufferings have brought them to
this peace. That was well said, replies Candide, “ mods il font cultiver
notre jar din”— we must cultivate our garden. The little novel ends.</p>
<p>Voltaire had managed to put into small compass, within the frame of a
story of adventure and love, a telling satire of Leibniz’ theodicy,
Pope’s optimism, religious abuses, monastic amours, class prejudices,
political cor- ruption, legal chicanery, judicial venality, the
barbarity of the penal code, the injustice of slavery, and the
destructiveness of war; Candide was com- posed while the Seven Years’
War dragged through its hither and thither of victory, devastation, and
death. Flaubert called Voltaire’s masterpiece “ le resume de toutes ses
oeuvres” the summary of all his works. 36 It had the defect of most
satires, absurd exaggeration; but Voltaire knew quite well that few men
ever encounter so bitter a concatenation of catastrophes as Candide’s.

<p>V. THE CONSCIENCE OF EUROPE</p>
<p>Jean Calas was one of a small group of Huguenots — Calvinist
Protestants — left in Toulouse after a century of persecution,
confiscation of property, and compulsory conversion to Catholicism. The
law of France not only excluded Protestants from public office, it
declared them ineligible to be lawyers, or physicians, or apothecaries,
or midwives, or booksellers, or goldsmiths, or grocers. If they had not
been baptized they had no civil rights whatever. If they had not been
married by a Catholic priest they were held to be living in concubinage,
and their children were accounted illegitimate. 37 Protestant services
were forbidden; men found at such serv- ices were to be sent to the
galleys for life; women so found were con- demned to life imprisonment;
and the officiating clergyman was put to death. These laws were not
strictly enforced in or near Paris; the severity of their enforcement
varied with distance from the capital.</p>
<p>Southern France was especially intense in its religious hatreds;
there the struggle between Catholics and Huguenots had been most
merciless; each side had committed atrocities that were yet warm in
transmitted memories. In Toulouse, in 1562, the victorious Catholics had
slain three thousand Huguenots, and the Parlement of Toulouse had
condemned two hundred more to torture and death. 38 Every year the
Catholics of Toulouse com- memorated that slaughter with grateful
ceremonies and a religious proces- sion. The guilds of craftsmen, the
various grades of nobles and clergy, the “companies” of White Penitents,
Black Penitents, and Gray Penitents marched solemnly through the city,
carrying awesome relics — the skull of the first bishop of Toulouse, a
piece of the Virgin’s dress, and bones of children killed in Herod’s
legendary “slaughter of the innocents.” It was unfortunate for Calas
that the approaching year was the bicentenary of the events of 1562.</p>
<p>The Parlement of Toulouse, which was as powerful in Languedoc as</p>
<p>hat of Paris was in central France, was now predominantly Jansenist —
i.e., Catholic with a strong infusion of Calvinistic rigor and gloom. It
lost no chance to prove itself more inflexibly Catholic than the
Jesuits. On March 2, 1761, it condemned to death the Huguenot Pastor
Rochette for con- ducting Protestant services, and it decreed death for
three “gentlemen of the Comte de Foix” who had tried to free Rochette
from the gendarmes. 39 On March 22 it ordered the torture and execution
of a Huguenot shop- keeper on the charge that he had killed a son who
had proposed to become a Catholic.</p>
<p>It should be said, in fairness to fanatics, that Calvin’s Institutes
of the Christian Religion gave some ground for their belief that
Calvinists con-</p>
<p>728</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>sidered it permissible for a father to kill a disobedient child. In
times when law was still weak, and the family was the chief — almost the
only — source of discipline, many societies gave the father the right of
life and death over his children. Something of this patriarchal code may
have been in Calvin’s mind when he wrote: “The Lord commands all those
who are disobedient to their parents to be put to death.” 40 Calvin
referred to Deuteronomy xxi, 17-21, and Matthew xv, 4-6; those passages,
however, merely allow the parents to accuse their son before “the elders
of the city,” who then may condemn him to death; and doubtless this is
what Calvin meant. But the excited Catholics of southern France
suspected that Hugue- not parents, unable to appeal to the “elders of
the city,” would take that old law into their own hands.</p>
<p>It is against this dark background that we must see the case of
Jean</p>
<p>Calas.</p>
<p>He was a marchmd (Findiennes — dealer in linens — who kept a store on
the main street of Toulouse, where he had lived for forty years. He and
his wife had four sons and two daughters. For thirty years they had kept
a Catholic, Jeanne Vigniere, as governess of their children, even after
she had converted one son, Louis, to Catholicism. Louis now lived as an
ap- prentice in another street, and received a regular allowance from
his father. Donat, the youngest son, was apprenticed at Nimes. Two other
sons, Pierre and Marc Antoine, lived with their parents. Marc Antoine,
the old- est, had studied law, but when he was prepared to practice he
found the profession closed to all but Catholics. He tried to conceal
his Protestantism, and to secure a certificate of Catholicism; his
deceit was discovered, and he faced a choice of abandoning Protestantism
or letting his years of law study go to waste. He took to brooding,
gambling, and drink. He liked to declaim Hamlet’s soliloquy on suicide.
41</p>
<p>On October 13, 1761, the Calas family gathered in their rooms over
the store. Gaubert Lavaysse, a friend of Marc Antoine, had just arrived
from Bordeaux; he accepted the father’s invitation to stay for dinner.
After the</p>
<p>At this point the father made a tragic error. He knew that a law then
in force required that a suicide be drawn naked through the streets, be
pelted by the populace with mud and stones, and then be hanged; and all
his property was to be forfeited to the state. The father begged, and
per- suaded, his family to report the case as a natural death. 42
Meanwhile the cries of Pierre and the arrival of the doctor had brought
a crowd to the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 729</p>
<p>door of the shop. An officer came up, heard the story told him, saw
the rope and the mark it had left on the dead man’s neck, and ordered
the family, Lavaysse, and Jeanne Vigniere to the Hotel de Ville. There
they were locked up in separate cells. On the next day each of them was
ques- tioned. All abandoned the claim of a natural death, and testified
to a suicide. The commandant of police refused to believe them, and
charged them with having killed Marc Antoine to prevent his becoming a
convert. The accusation was taken up by the populace and by many members
of the Toulouse Parlement. A frenzy of revenge closed the minds of the
people. It seems incredible to us now that anyone should believe in the
murder of a son by his father to prevent a change of faith; but that is
because we are thinking as individuals, and after two centuries of
decline in religious faith. The people of Toulouse thought en masse, as
a crowd; and crowds can feel but they cannot think. The frenzy was fed
by a ceremony which the White Penitents staged in their chapel; over an
empty coffin a skeleton was suspended, holding in one hand an
inscription, “Abjuration of Heresy,” and in the other a palm branch,
symbolizing martyrdom; below was the name “Marc Antoine Calas.” Assum
ing that the youth was not a suicide, they buried the corpse with great
pomp in the Church of St. Stephen. A part of the clergy protested in
vain against this anticipation of a verdict of murder. 43</p>
<p>The trial of the Calas family took place before the twelve judges
of</p>
<p>he municipal court of Toulouse. An admonition was sent out, to be
read on three successive Sundays in every church, summoning to the
witness stand all who knew anything about the death. Several persons
appeared. A barber testified that he had heard a cry from the Calas
house on the fatal evening: “Ah, mon Dieu, they are strangling me!”
Others claimed to have heard such cries. On November io, 1761, the
municipal court pronounced Jean Calas, his wife, and Pierre guilty, and
sentenced them to be hanged; it condemned Lavaysse to the galleys, and
Jeanne Vigniere to five years’ imprisonment. The Catholic governess had
sworn to the innocence of her Protestant employers.</p>
<p>The decision was appealed to the Parlement of Toulouse, which ap-
pointed a panel of thirteen judges. Sixty-three additional witnesses
were heard. All the hostile evidence was hearsay. The trial dragged on
for three months, during which the Calas family and Lavaysse were kept
in separate confinement. The final decision condemned only the father.
No one ex- plained how a man sixty-four years old, unaided, could have
overcome and strangled his mature son. The court hoped that Calas, under
torture, would confess. He was subjected to the question ordinaire: his
arms and legs were stretched until they were pulled from their sockets.
He was re- peatedly exhorted to confess; he repeatedly affirmed that
Marc Antoine</p>
<p>730</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>had committed suicide. After half an hour’s rest he was pu t to the
question extraordinaire; fifteen pints of water were poured down his
throat; he still protested his innocence; fifteen further pints were
forced into him, swelling his body to twice its normal size; he still
maintained his innocence. He was allowed to expel the water. Then he was
taken to a public square before the cathedral; he was laid upon a cross;
an executioner, with eleven blows of an iron bar, broke each of his
limbs in two places; the old man, calling upon Jesus Christ, proclaimed
his innocence. After two hours of agony he was strangled. The corpse was
bound to a stake and burned (March io,</p>
<p>1762). 44</p>
<p>The other prisoners were freed, but the property of Calas was confis-
cated by the state. The widow and Pierre crept into hidden retirement at
Montauban. The two daughters were sent to separate convents. Donat,
finding his position at Nimes endangered, fled to Geneva. Voltaire,
hear- ing of the tragedy on March 22, invited Donat to meet him at Les
Delices. “I asked him,” wrote Voltaire to Damilaville, “if his father
and mother were of violent character. He told me that they had never
beaten any of their children, and that there were no parents more tender
and indulgent.” 45 Voltaire consulted two Genevan merchants who had
lodged with Calas at Toulouse; they confirmed Donat’s statement. He
wrote to friends in Languedoc; “both Catholics and Protestants replied
to me that the guilt of the family was beyond reasonable doubt.” 46
Voltaire communicate d with the widow; she sent him a statement so
manifestly sincere that he was moved to action. He appealed to Cardinal
de Bernis, to d’Argental, to the Duchesse d’Enville, to the Marquise de
Nicolai, to the Due de Villars, to the Due de Richelieu, to be g the
King’s ministers, Choiseul and Saint - Florentin, to order an
investigation of the trial. He took Donat Calas into his family, brought
Pierre Calas to Geneva, and persuaded Mme. Calas to take lodging in
Paris, where she could be available for examination. He engaged lawyers
to advise him on the legal technicalities of the case. He published a
pamphlet, Original Documents concerning the Death of Sieur Calas , 47
and followed this up with further publications. He appealed to other
authors to lend their pens to the effort to rouse the conscience of
Europe. He wrote to Damilaville: “Cry out yourself, and let others cry
out; cry out for the Calas family and against fanaticism.” 48 And to
d’Alembert: “Shout everywhere, I beg you, for the Calas family against
fanaticism, for it is I’infdme that has caused their misery.” 49 He
solicited funds to help him bear the expense of the campaign, which he
had thus far paid himself. Contributions came from a hundred quarters,
including the Queen of Eng- land, the Empress of Russia, the King of
Poland. A prominent Paris lawyer, £lie de Beaumont, agreed, without fee,
to prepare the case for presentation to the Council of State. The
daughters of Calas were moved to Paris to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>73 1</p>
<p>join their mother. One of them brought a letter from a Catholic nun
ap- pealing for the Calas family. 50 On March 7, 1763, mother and
daughters were given audience by the King’s minist ers. The verdict was
unanimous that the case be examined. All relevant documents were ordered
from Toulouse.</p>
<p>But the Toulouse magistrates found a hundred devices for delay in</p>
<p>gathering and remitting the papers. It was during that summer that
Vol- taire wrote and sent forth his epochal Traite sur la tolerance. To
widen its appeal he adopted a tone of surprising moderation. Concealing
his au- thorship, he spoke as a man of Christian piety, a believer in
immortality; he praised the bishops of Franc e as “gentlemen who think
and act with a nobility that befits their birth”; 51 he pretended to
accept the principle, “Out of the Church there is no salvation.” 52 The
treatise was addressed not to philosophers but to the Catholic clergy
itself. Even so, it had its audacities, for often he forgot his
audience.</p>
<p>He began with an account of the trial and execution of Calas. He re-
viewed the history of toleration, exaggerating it in the case of Greece
and Rome. He anticipated Gibbon by arguing that Roman persecution of
Christians was immeasurably surpassed by Christian persecution of
heretics, who were “hanged, drowned, broken on the wheel, or burned, for
the love of God.” 53 He defended the Reformation as a justified revolt
against the sale of indulgences by a papacy lately disgraced through the
amours of Pope Alexander VI and the murders perpetrated by the Pope’s
son Caesar Borgia. He expressed his shock at reading a recent attempt to
justify the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.* He admitted that Protestants
too had been intolerant.f Nevertheless he recommended that Protestant
worship be al- lowed in France, and that the banished Huguenots be
allowed to return.</p>
<p>They ask only the protection of natural law, the validity of
their</p>
<p>marriages, security as to the condition of their children, the right
to inherit from their fathers, and the enfranchisement of their persons.
They ask not for public chapels, or the right to municipal offices and
dignities. 55</p>
<p>Despite this strategic limitation, Voltaire defined toleration:</p>
<p>Do I propose, then, that every citizen shall be free to follow
his</p>
<p>own reason, and believe whatever his enlightened or deluded
reason</p>
<p>This was in an Apologie de Louis XIV (1762), by the Abbe de Caveyrac.
Many Catholic clergymen condemned this book. 54</p>
<p>“The Lutheran and Calvinist preachers would probably be as little
inclined to pity, as obdurate and intolerant, as they upbraid their
antagonists with being. The barbarous law whereby any Roman Catholic is
forbidden to reside more than three days in certain coun- tries is not
yet revoked.”— Essay on Free Toleration , in Works , XXIa, 257. Cf.
Voltaire’s denunciation of the intolerant Huguenot Jurieu in the article
“David” in the Dic tionnaire philosophique.</p>

<p>shall dictate to him? Certainly, provided he does not disturb the
public order…. If you insist that it is a crime not to believe in the
domi-</p>
<p>nant religion, you condemn the first Christians, your forefathers;
and you justify those whom you reproach with persecuting them….</p>
<p>For a government to have the right to punish the errors of men it
is</p>
<p>necessary that their errors should take the form of crime. They do
not take the form of crime unless they disturb society. They disturb
so-</p>
<p>ciety when they engender fanaticism. Hence men must avoid fanati-
cism in order to deserve toleration. 56</p>
<p>Voltaire concluded with an address to the Deity:</p>
<p>Thou hast not given us hearts to hate, nor hands to kill, one
another. Grant that we may aid one another to support the burden of this
pain- ful and transitory life! May the trifling differences in the
garments</p>
<p>hat cover our frail bodies, in the mode of expressing our…</p>
<p>houghts, in our ridiculous customs and imperfect laws… — in a</p>
<p>word, may the slight variations that are found amongst the atoms</p>
<p>called men not be used by us as signals of mutual hatred and persecu-
tion!… May all men remember that they are brothers! 57</p>
<p>We do not know what share this appeal had in leading to the edict of
toleration issued by Louis XVI in 1787; nor whether it reached or moved
the ministers of Louis XV. In any case, after delays that tried the
souls of t he Calas family and their defenders, the King’s Council, on
March 9, 1765, declared the condemnation of Jean Calas annulled, and
pronounced him innocent; and Choiseul obtained from the King a grant of
thirty thousand livres as compensation to the widow and her children for
the loss of their property. When the news of the verdict reached Ferney,
Voltaire wept with joy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (March 19, 1764) a municipal court at Mazamet, in south-
central France, ordered Pierre Paul Sirven and his wife to be hanged on
the charge of murdering their daughter Elisabeth to prevent her
conversion to Catholicism. The judgment decreed that the two surviving
daughters must witness the execution of their parents. 58 The ceremony
had to be performed in effigy, for the family had fled to Geneva (April,
1762), and had told their story to Voltaire.</p>
<p>Sirven was a Protestant living in Castres, some forty miles east
of</p>
<p>Toulouse. On March 6, 1760, the youngest daughter, Elisabeth, disap-
peared. The parents sought for her in vain. The bishop of Castres sum-
moned them, and informed them that he had sent the girl to a convent
after she had confided to him her desire to become a Catholic. French

from the parents, if necessary by force, any child above the age of
seven who asked for conversion. In the convent Elisabeth had delusions,
spoke to angels, tore the clothes from her body, and begged to be
flogged. The nuns, at a loss for ways to handle her, notified the
bishop, who ordered her restored to her parents.</p>
<p>In July, 1761, the family moved to St.-Abby, fifty miles from
Castres. There, one night in December, Elisabeth left her room, and did
not return. On January 3 her corpse was found in a well. The people of
St.-Abby were not inclined to charge the Sirvens with murder. Of
forty-five wit- nesses called before the local court, all without
exception expressed the opinion that the girl had committed suicide, or
had fallen into the well by accident. The local prosecutor, Trinquier,
sent notice of the case to the prosecutor general in Toulouse, who
instructed him to proceed on the as- sumption that Sirven was guilty.
This seemed improbable, for Sirven had been out of town on the night of
Elisabeth’s disappearance. His wife was old and weak. One of the
daughters was pregnant. It was hardly likely that these women could have
pushed the girl into a well without a cry being heard. But on January 20
Trinquier ordered Sirven’s arrest.</p>
<p>Sirven knew that some two months previously the municipal court of
Toulouse had condemned Jean Calas to death on a similar charge, and on
dubious evidence. Ultimately his own case, if he submitted to arrest and
trial, would come before the Parlement of Toulouse. Having no confidence
in these courts, he led his wife and daughters, in midwinter, across
France and over the Cevennes Mountains to Geneva, hoping that the
defender of Calas would come to his aid.</p>
<p>Voltaire, still immersed in his campaign for Calas, thought it unwise
to confuse the French mind with two causes at once. He contributed to
the support of the family, whose property had been confiscated. But when
the Toulouse authorities dragged their feet in responding to the demand
for the Calas documents, Voltaire resumed the attack by beginning a cam-
paign for Sirven. Again he appealed for help and funds; contributions
came from Frederick II of Prussia and Christian VII of Denmark, and
again</p>
<p>from Catherine II of Russia and Stanislas Poniatowski, King of
Poland. The M azamet court refused Voltaire’s request for a copy of the
trial record.</p>
<p>Amid these labors he was alarmed to learn that he himself was
involved in a case that had flared up at Abbeville on the Channel Coast.
On the night</p>
<p>734</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>of August 8-9, 1765, a wooden crucifix on the Pont-Neuf over the
Somme was mutilated, and a crucifix in the Cemetery of St. -Catherine
was smeared with ordure. When these profanations were discovered the
clergy and people of the town were horrified. The bishop of Amiens came
to Abbe- ville and, barefoot, led a procession which nearly all the
population fol- lowed, begging forgiveness of God. A monitoire was read
in all the</p>
<p>churches decreeing severe penalties for all who could shed light on
the mystery and failed to come forward. Magistrate Duval heard
seventy-seven witnesses. Some of them testified that they had noticed
three young men pass a Corpus Christi procession without either bending
a knee or remov- ing their hats. Others alleged that a band of youths in
Abbeville, including Duval’s son, made a practice of burlesquing
religious ceremonies and sing - ing licentious songs. 60 On August 2 6
warrants were issued for Gaillard d’Etallonde, for Chevalier Jean
Franqois Lefebre de La Barre, and for a youth of seventeen known to
history only as Moisnel. D’Etallonde fled to Prussia, Moisnel and La
Barre were arrested. Moisnel won partial pardon by confessing that he
and the others were guilty of the acts alleged. He accused La Barre of
having spat upon pictures of the saints, of having sung an obscene
litany called “La Madeleine,” of having lent him the Diction - naire
philosophique and Epitre a Uranie of Voltaire; and he claimed to have
seen d’Etallonde strike the crucifix on the bridge and sully the cross
in the cemetery.</p>
<p>La Barre was the grandson of an impoverished general. He confessed to
being a heretic. A witness reported that La Barre, on being asked why he
had not removed his hat before the Corpus Christi procession, had
replied that he “regarded the Host as a piece of wax,” and could not
understand why anyone would adore a God of dough. La Barre admitted that
he might have said something of the kind; he had (he said) heard other
young men express such sentiments, and thought he might harmlessly hold
them, too. His library was examined; among his books were Voltaire’s
Dictionnaire, Helvetius’ De f Esprit, and other vo lumes satirizing
religion. At first he disclaimed all knowledge of d’Etallonde’s
desecrations, but when he learned that Moisnel had revealed them, he
confessed that it was true. The final indictment charged La Barre with
“uttering blasphemies against Go d, the Holy Eucharist, the Holy Virgin,
the religion and commandments of God and of the Church; singing two
songs filled with execrable and abominable blasphemies,… rendering marks
of adoration and respect to infamous books; profaning the sign of the
cross, the mystery of the consecration of the wine, and the benedictions
in use in churches and among Christians.” 61</p>
<p>On February 28, 1766, the Abbeville court pronounced sentence. La
Barre, and d’Etallonde if apprehended, were to be put to rhe tor ture to
elicit the names of accomplices; they were to do public penance
before</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 735</p>
<p>he principal church of the city; their tongues were to be torn out by
the roots, they were then to be beheaded, and their bodies were to be
burned to ashes. The Dictionnaire philosophique of Voltaire was to be
thrown into the same fire. The sentence was appealed to the Parlement of
Paris. Some members pleaded for mitigation; Councilor Pasquier replied
that a signal and frightening punishment was needed to stem the tide of
godlessness that was threatening all moral and social stability; the
real criminal, he argued, was Voltaire, but as that source of the evil
was beyond reach of the Parle- ment, his disciple should suffer in his
stead. Two members voted to com- mute the sentence; fifteen voted for
its full execution. On July i, 1766, it was carried out, except that
there was no tearing out of the tongue. La Barre bore his fate without
implicating any of his friends. The executioner severed the head with a
well-directed blow, to the applause of the crowd. 62</p>
<p>Voltaire was shocked by the severity of the punishment; this, he
felt, was a barbarity worthy of the Spanish Inquisition at its worst.
The bishop of Annecy wrote to the French court demanding that all the
penalties pre- scribed in the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes be
applied to Voltaire. “That rascally bishop,” wrote Voltaire to
d’Alembert, “still swears… that he will have me burned in this world or
the other…. To escape being burned I am laying in a supply of holy
water.” 63 Fearing that he might be summoned before the Parlement of
Dijon, he took the oppor- tunity to try the medicinal waters at Rolle in
Switzerland. Then he re- turned to Femey, and resumed his efforts for
Sirven.</p>
<p>Now he proposed to d’Alembert and Diderot that he and they and
other</p>
<p>The scene which has occurred at Abbeville is tragic, but was
there</p>
<p>not some fault in those who were punished? Should we directly at-</p>
<p>ack the prejudices that time has consecrated in the mind of
nations?</p>
<p>And if we wish to enjoy liberty of thought, must we insult
established belief? A man who does not wish to make a disturbance is
rarely</p>
<p>persecuted. Remember Fontenelle’s saying: “If m y hand were full of
truths, I should think more than once before opening it.” (ii</p>
<p>As to the proposed colony of philosophes at Cleves, Frederick offered
pro- tection, but on condition that they keep the peace and respect the
faith of the people. He added:</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>736</p>
<p>The average man does not deserve to be enlightened…. If the</p>
<p>philosophers were to form a government, the people, after 150 years,
would forge some new superstition, and would either pray to little</p>
<p>idols, or to the graves in which the great men were buried, or invoke
the sun, or commit some similar nonsense. Superstition is a weakness of
the human mind, which is inseparably tied up with it; it has always
existed, and always will. 65</p>
<p>Voltaire persisted in his campaign. He sent forth a simple Narrative
of the Death of the Chevalier de La Bane. He wrote to his royal friends
ask- ing them to intercede with Louis XV to have the dead youth in some
way rehabilitated; and when these efforts failed he sent to Louis XVI
(1775) a letter entitled “The Cry of Innocent Blood.” The judgment
against La Barre was never reversed, but Voltaire had the satisfaction
of seeing Turgot revise the criminal code that had sanctioned the
execution of a youth for offenses that seemed to merit something less
than decapitation. With an energy remarkable at his age, Voltaire
continued to the end of his life to lead the crusade against the
excesses of Church and state. In 1764 he secured the liberation of
Claude Chaumont, who had been condemned to the gal- leys for attending
Protestant services. When Comte Thomas de Lally, the French commander
who had been defeated by the English in India, was beheaded in Paris
(1766) on charges of treason and cowardice, Voltaire, appealed to by
Lally’s son, wrote a 300 -page volume, Historical Fragments on India,
exonerating the Count; and he urged Mme. du Barry to inter- cede with
Louis XV. The sentence was annulled in 1778, shortly before Voltaire’s
death.</p>
<p>These labors exhausted the octogenarian warrior, but they made him
the hero of liberal France. Diderot remarked, in Le Neveu de Rameau,
“[Vol - taire’s] Mahomet is a sublime work, but I would like better to
have vindi - cated Calas.” 06 Pomaret, a Protestant minist er in Geneva,
said to Voltaire: “You seem to attack Christianity, and yet you do the
work of a Chris - tian.” 67 And Frederick, after all his cautions,
joined in the tributes to the man who had made himself the conscience of
Europe: “How splendid it is that a philosopher makes his voice heard
from his refuge, and that the human race, whose spokesman he is, forces
the judges to revise an unjust sentence. If nothing else spoke in favor
of M. de Voltaire, this alone would be enough to earn him a place among
the benefactors of mankind.” 08</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ECRASEZ L’lNFAME!</li>
</ol>
<p>It was in the ardor of these struggles that Voltaire’s opposition to
Chris - tianity became a hatred that almost consumed a decade of his
life (1759-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>737</p>
<p>69). He had begun with a youthful scorn of the miracles, mysteries,
and myths that comforted the people; and he passed on to a mocking
skepti- cism of those Christian doctrines, like the Trinity, the
Incarnation, and the Atonement, which St. Thomas Aquinas had frankly
confessed to be be- yond the reach of reason. But these moods of
rebellion were natural in an active mind feeling the sap of growth;
Voltaire might have passed through them to the man of the world’s genial
connivance at beliefs so dear to the</p>
<p>Damiens’ attempt at assassination (1757) to draw from the state a n
edict (1759) making any attack upon the Church a crime to be punished
with death. The philosophies saw in this a declaration of war, and felt
that hence- forth they need spare no feelings, no traditions, in
attacking what seemed to them a murderous absurdity. Behind the beauty
and poetry of religion they saw propaganda conscripting art; behind the
support that Christianity had given to morality they saw a thousand
heretics burned at the stake, the Albigensians crushed out in a
homicidal crusade, Spain and Portugal darkened with autos-da-fe, France
torn apart by rival mythologies, and all the future of the human spirit
subject in every land to the repeated resur- rection of superstition,
priestcraft, and persecution. They would fight such a medieval reaction
with the last years of their life.</p>
<p>Three events made the year 1762 a turning point in the irrepressible
conflict. In March the execution of Jean Calas seemed to announce the
return of France to the Middle Ages and the Inquisition. The trial, tor-
ture, and murder were all conducted by the “secular arm,” but against
the background of popular fanaticism engendered by religious
indoctrination, ceremony, and hate. In May Rousseau’s Emile gave to the
world the “Pro - fession of Faith of the S avoyard Vicar,” which, though
written by an</p>
<p>opponent of the philosophes, swept away from Christianity almost
every- thing but belief in God and the ethics of Christ. The burning of
the book on June 1 1 in Paris and on June 19 in Geneva seemed to unite
Catholicism and Calvinism in a conspiracy against the human mind. In
August the con- demnation of the Jesuits by the Paris Parlement was
apparently a triumph for the philosophes, but it was also a victory for
the Jansenists who con- trolled the Parlements of Paris, Toulouse, and
Rouen; and the actions of the parlements in the cases of Calas and La
Barre made it clear that the Jansenists were as bitter enemies of
intellectual freedom as any in the his- tory of France. Meanwhile the
hostility between the parlements and the court, and the growing
ascendancy (1758-70) of the semi-Voltairean</p>
<p>738</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Choiseul in the government, gave the philosophes an opportunity to
fight back with less than their usual danger from state censors and the
police. The stage was set for the climax of the attack upon
Christianity.</p>
<p>Now Voltaire spread and shouted the watchword of his ire, “ Bcrasez
I’infame! Crush the infamy!” He had begun to use the phrase in 1759;
henceforth he repeated it a hundred times and in a dozen forms;
occasion- ally he used it as a signature. 69 A fresh vitality came to
the sixty-eight-year- old Voltaire as he likened himself to Cato Senex
crying out, at the end of his speeches to the Roman Senate, “Delenda est
Carthago! Deleatur Car - thago!” “I have the colic,” he wrote, “I suffer
much; but when I attack</p>
<p>What did he mean by “the infamy”? Did he propose to crush supersti -
tion, fanaticism, obscurantism, and persecution? Or was he undertaking
to destroy the Catholic Church, or all forms of Christianity, or all
religion itself? Hardly the last, for we find him again and again, even
amid the campaign, professing his theistic faith, sometimes in terms
warm with Vol- tairean piety. In the Dictionnaire philosophique he
defined religion indi- rectly: “Almost everything that goes beyond the
adoration of a Supreme Being, and of submitting one’s heart to his
eternal orders, is superstition.” 71 This would seem to reject all forms
of Christianity except Unitarianism. Voltaire repudiated nearly all the
distinctive doctrines of traditional Chris- tianity-original sin,
Trinity, Incarnation, Atonement, Eucharist; he ridi- culed the
“sacrifice” of God to God on the Cross, or by the priest in the Mass.
Consequently he rejected most forms of Protestantism too; he reck- oned
Calvinism to be as obscurantist as Catholicism, and shocked the Gen-
evan pastors by calling Calvin il atroce.” He thought he could live con-
tentedly under the Established Church as he had seen it in England. He
wrote to d’Alembert “I hope you will destroy rinfame; that is the great
- gion in general, but religion as organized to propagate superstition
and mythology, to control education, and to oppose dissent with
censorship and persecution. And such was Christianity as Voltaire saw it
in history and in France.</p>
<p>So he burned all his bridges behind him, and called his cohorts to
war. “To overturn the col umns only five or six philosophes are needed
who understand one another…. The vine of truth has been cultivated by
the d’Alemberts, the Diderots, the Bolingbrokes, and the Humes,” 73 but
too sporadically, and without consistent plan. Now they must unite, and
he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>739</p>
<p>akes it for granted that he will be their general. He advises them on
tac- tics: “Strike, and hide your hand…. I hope that every year each of
our fraternity will aim some arrows at the monster, without its learning
from whose hand they came.” 74 Let the brothers insinuate themselves
into the</p>
<p>Sire, you are perfectly right: a wise and courageous prince, with</p>
<p>money, troops, and laws, can quite well govern men without the aid of
religion, which was made only to deceive them…. Your</p>
<p>Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this
infamous superstition. I do not say among the rabble, who are not</p>
<p>worthy of being enlightened, and who are apt for every yoke; I
say</p>
<p>among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to
think…. ’Tis for you to feed their minds…. My one regret</p>
<p>in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise. 75</p>
<p>Frederick smiled at the old man’s naivete, but Voltaire persisted,
and not without some effect, as we may later see, on the cabinet
ministers of France, Portugal, and Spain.</p>
<p>He welcomed lesser aides. He wrote apostolic exhortations to Bordes
in Lyons, to Servan in Grenoble, to Pierre Rousseau in Bouillon, to
Audibert in Marseilles, to Ribaute in Montauban, to the Marquis
d’Argence in Charente, to the Abbe Audra in Toulouse. All these and
others he called “ les freres” the bre thren; to them he sent material
and appeals, prodding them lest they sleep on their arms.</p>
<p>Attack, brothers, skillfully, all of you, Vinfdme. What interests
me</p>
<p>is the propagation of the faith and of truth, the progress of
philosophy, the suppression of Vinfdme.</p>

<p>740</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Now books became weapons, and literature became war. Not only did
Diderot, d’Alembert, Helvetius, d’Holbach, Raynal, Morellet, and a dozen
others bring their pens to the battle, but Voltaire himself, always
dying, be- came a veritable armory of anticlerical missiles. Within a
decade he sent forth some thirty booklets. He had no belief in the
efficacy of large vol- umes.</p>
<p>What harm can a book [the Encyclopedie ] do that costs a hundred</p>
<p>crowns?… Twenty volumes folio will never create a revolution. It</p>
<p>is the little portable volumes of thirty sous that are to be feared.
If</p>
<p>he Gospel had cost i zoo sesterces the Christian religion would never
have been established. 77</p>
<p>So he poured forth not merely histories and plays but pamphlets,
stories, sermons, “instructions,” catechisms, diatribes, dialogues,
letters, short cri - tiques of the Bible or of Church history, anything
that could circulate easily and prick the infdme. People called these
productions petits pdtes — cookies, easy to digest. Long ago Frederick
had written to him:</p>
<p>I imagine that somewhere in France there is a select society of
su-</p>
<p>perior and equal geniuses who all work together and publish their</p>
<p>writings under the name of Voltaire…. If this supposition is true</p>
<p>I shall become a Trinitarian, and shall begin to see daylight in
this</p>
<p>mystery which the Christians have hitherto believed without under-
standing. 78</p>
<p>But now Voltaire did not write in the name of Voltaire. He used over
a hundred different pseudonyms; and sometimes, in his impish humor, he
ascribed his anti- Christian blasts to “the Archbishop of Canterbury” or
“the Archbishop of Paris,” or an abbe, a pastor, or a monk. To throw the
hounds of heaven off his trail he dedicated one of his pellets to
himself. He knew printers in Paris, Amsterdam, the Hague, London, and
Berlin; he used them in his campaign. Through Damilaville and others he
had his brochures given free to booksellers, who sold them at low price
and calcu- lated risk. The seed went forth.</p>
<p>He published now (1762) that Sermon des cinquantes, or Sermon of the
Fifty, which he had written at least ten years before and had read to
Frederick at Potsdam. It was his first direct attack upon Christianity.
It be- gan quite innocently:</p>
<p>Fifty persons, educated, pious, and reasonable [the Quakers in Lon-
don?], assembled every Sunday in a populous commercial city. They
prayed, and one of them pronounced a discourse; then they dined;</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 741</p>
<p>hen they took up a collection for the poor. Each presided in
turn,</p>
<p>led the prayer, and pronounced the sermon. This is one of the
prayers, and one of the sermons….</p>
<p>God of all the globes and stars,… keep us from all superstition.</p>
<p>If we insult you by unworthy sacrifices, abolish these infamous mys-
teries. If we dishonor the Divinity by absurd fables, may these fables
perish forever…. Let men live and die in the worship of one sole</p>
<p>God,… a God who could neither be born nor die. 79</p>
<p>The sermon argued that the God revealed in the Old Testament is a
boast- ful, jealous, angry, cruel, homicidal God, whom no sane person
could worship, and that David was a scoundrel, a lecher, and a murderer.
How could anyone believe such a book to be the word of God? And how from
the Gospels could have come the incredible theology of Christianity, the
easy, daily feat of turning a wafer into the body and blood of Christ,
the innumerable relics, the sale of indulgences, the hatreds and
holocausts of the religious wars?</p>
<p>We are told that the people need mysteries, and must be deceived.</p>
<p>My brethren, dare anyone commit this outrage on humanity? Have</p>
<p>not our fathers [the Reformers] taken from the people their transub-
stantiation, auricular confession, indulgences, exorcisms, false
miracles, and ridiculous statues? Are not our people now accustomed to
doing without these superstitions? We must have the courage to go a few
steps further. The people are not so weak in mind as is supposed; they
will easily admit a wise and simple cult of one God…. We seek</p>
<p>not to despoil the clergy of what the liberality of their followers
has given them; we wish them — since most of them secretly laugh at the
falsehoods they teach — to join us in preaching the truth…. What in-
calculable good would be done by that happy change! 80</p>
<p>All this is tiresome to us today, but it was revolutionary material
in eight- eenth-century France. No wonder Voltaire sent it forth under
the pretense that it had been written by La Mettrie, who was safely
dead.</p>
<p>In 1763 the warrior diverted himself with dramas, a worthless short
story called “Blanc et noir,” and a little Catechisme de Fhonnete homme
retailing his “natural religion.” But 1764 was a major year: Voltaire
kept his printers busy with UEvangile de la raison , and Examen de la
religion (a modified edition of Jean Mesl ier’s fiery Testament ), and
one of his most important publications: Dictionnaire philosoploique
portatif. It was not the immense tome of 824 large double-column pages
that we have in one form today, or the five or eight volumes that it
fills in his collected works; it was a small book, easy to hold or to
conceal. The brevity of its</p>
<p>742 the AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>articles, the simplicity and clarity of its style, carried it to a
million readers in a dozen lands.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable production for one man. There are probably a thou-
sand errors in it, but the vast accumulation of data, the erudition in
almost every field, make the book one of the miracles in the history of
literature. What industry, loquacity, pertinacity! Voltaire gossips; he
has something to say on nearly everything, and almost always something
of still-living interest. There are here many bits of frivolity,
triviality, or superficiality; there are some foolish remarks (“The
intellect of Europe has made greater</p>
<p>Essentially the book aimed to serve as an arsenal of arguments
against Christianity as Voltaire knew it. Here once more are the
incredibilities, absurdities, and scandals of the Bible, not only in the
article “Contradic - tions,” but on almost every page. Who gave the
Church the authority to pronounce “canonical” and God -inspired four of
the fifty gospels that were written in the century after the death of
Jesus? What a revealing oversight it was to speak of the Virgin Birth of
Jesus and yet trace his genealogy to that rascal David through the
allegedly faineant Joseph! Why did Chris- tianity reject the Mosaic Law
despite Christ’s repeated confirmation of it? Was Paul, who rejected
that Law (because of a little piece of skin) a</p>
<p>greater authority than Christ?</p>
<p>The city fathers of Geneva did not like the Dictionnaire
philosophique ; on September 24, 1763, the Council of Twenty-five
ordered the executioner to burn every copy that he could find. The
Parlement of Paris ordered a similar bonfire in 1765; we have seen the
fate of the book in Abbeville (1766). Voltaire assured the Genevan
authorities that the Dictionary was the work of a corps of writers
entirely unknown to him. Meanwhile he prepared supplementary articles
for the four further editions that were secretly printed before the end
of 1765, and he poured new material into the five additional editions
that appeared before his death in 1778. He arranged with the conniving
booksellers of Geneva to supply them with as many free copies as they
could distribute, and with salesmen to leave copies at private doors.
82</p>
<p>He continued the war with intensified passion in the years 1765-67.
In 1 764 he had finally abandoned his house at Les Delices in a Geneva
too hot</p>
<p>CHAP, xxir)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>743</p>
<p>for his heresies; for almost three years he hardly stirred from his
property at Ferney; and nearly every month he sent to some printer a new
pamphlet against Finfame. Les Questions de Zapata (March, 1767)
pretended to be the queries put to a committee of theologians by a
professor of theology at the University of Salamanca in 1629. Zapata
confessed to doubts about the Star of Bethlehem, the supposed census of
“the whole earth” by Augustus, the slaughter of the innocents, and the
temptation of Jesus by Satan on a hill whence one could see all the
kingdoms of the earth.” Where was that</p>
<p>Zapata, receiving no answer, took to preaching God in all
simplicity.</p>
<p>He announced to men the common father, the rewarder, the punisher,
the pardoner. He extricated the truth from the lies, and separated</p>
<p>religion from fanaticism; he taught and practiced virtue. He was</p>
<p>gentle, kindly, and modest, and he was burned at Valladolid in the
year of grace 1631. 86</p>
<p>In May, 1767, Voltaire returned to the attack more vigorously in a
work of 105 pages, Examen important de milord Bolmgbroke; here he put
his arguments into the mouth of the dead Englishman, but Bolingbroke
would probably have accepted the imposition. In the same year Voltaire
published V Ingenu, a delightful 100-page story of an unbelievably
virtuous Huron Indian brought to France from America, and confused by
European cus- toms and Christian theology. In 1769 came Le Cri des
nations — an appeal to Catholic Europe to throw off the alleged
sovereignty of popes over kings and states. Again in that year he
sallied forth with a studious but impas- sioned Histoire du Parlement,
condemning that body as a conspiracy of Jansenist reactionaries. And in
1770-72 he issued nine volumes as Questions sur FEncyclopedie, a melange
of articles constituting another one-man en- cyclopedia, even more
pointedly anti-Catholic than the Portatif.</p>
<p>Usually he disguised his publications with deceptive titles: Homily
on the Interpretation of the Old Testament, Epistle to the Romans,
Sermons of the Rev. Jacques Rossetes, Homily of Pastor Bourne, Counsels
to the Fathers of Families. The educated public of France guessed that
Voltaire had written them, for he could not disguise his style, but no
one proved it. This exciting game became the talk of Paris and Geneva,
and its echoes were heard in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, even in Vienna.
Never in his-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>ory had a writer played such hide-and-seek with such powerful
enemies, and with such success. A hundred opponents tried to answer him;
he re- butted them all, fighting back roughly, sometimes coarsely or
unfairly; c’etait la guerre. And he enjoyed it. In the ardor of battle
he forgot to die.</p>
<p>Indeed, a strange new optimism came upon him, he who had seemed,
after the Lisbon earthquake and Candide, to advise surrender to the
evils of life as invincible. He dreamed of “philosophy” victorious over
a Church entrenched in the needs of the people. If twelve unlettered
fishermen had established Christianity, why could not twelve
philosophies shake it out of its dogmas a nd Inquisitions? “Live happy
and ecrasez I’infcbne,” he wrote to one of the “brothers,” and he
assured them, “We will crush it!” 87 Were not a king, an empress, a
royal mistress, and many other prominent persons openly or secretly on
his side? He courted the court by attacking the Parlement of Paris; he
enjoyed the favor of Mme. de Pompadour, and later of Mme. du Barry; he
even hoped for the connivance of Louis XV. He wrote to d’Alembert in
1767: “Let us bless this happy revolution which has been produced in the
minds of all honest men in the last fifteen or twenty years; it has
surpassed my hopes.” 88 Had he not foretold it? Had he not written to
Helvetius, in 1760: “This century begins to see the triumph o f reason”?

<p>He was not so simple as to imagine that religion had been invented by
priests. On the contrary he wrote, in the Dictionnaire
philosophique:</p>
<p>The idea of a god is derived from feeling, and that natural logic</p>
<p>which unfolds itself with age, even in the rudest of mankind.
Astonish- ing effects of nature were beheld — harvests and barrenness,
fair weather</p>
<p>notions to cement their power. 90</p>
<p>Each group singled out one of the supernatural powers as its tutelary
deity, and gave him adoration and sacrifices in the hope that he would
protect the group against the power and gods of other groups. Priests
had been produced by these beliefs, but the interpretations and rituals
were the work of the priests. In the course of time priests played upon
human fear to ex- tend their power. They committed all kinds of knavery,
extending at last to the murder of “heretics,” the assassination of
whole groups, and the near- ruin of nations. Voltaire concluded: “I
hated priests, I hate them, I shall hate them till doomsday.” 9 1</p>

<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>745</p>
<p>He found much that he could accept in non-Christian religions, espe-
cially in Confucianism (which was not a religion); but very little in
Chris- tian theology pleased him. “I have two hundred volu mes on this
subject, and, what is worse, I have read them. It is like going the
rounds of a lunatic asylum.” 92 He added little to previous Biblical
criticism; his function was to spread it, and the effect is with us
still. With more audacity than most of his predecessors, he emphasized
again and again the absurdity of Noah’s Deluge, the passage of the Red
Sea, the slaughter of the innocents, and so forth; and he never tired of
denouncing the story and theory of “orig - inal sin.” He quoted with
indignation St. Augustine’s dictum, “The Cath - olic faith teaches that
all men are born so guilty that even infants are cer- tainly damned when
they die without having been regenerated in Jesus.” 93 (We are now
informed that such infants go to a pleasantly warm place called Limbo,
next door to hell.)</p>
<p>As to Jesus, Voltaire vacillated. From the natural piety of childhood
he passed to youthful irreverencies, even to accepting the story of
Mary’s affair with a Roman soldier; and at one time he thought of Jesus
as a de- luded fanatic — “wra fou.” 9i As he matured he learned to
admire the ethical precepts of Jesus; we shall be saved by practicing
those principles, he said, rather than by believing that Christ was God.
He made much fun of the Trinity in The Atheist and the Sage. The atheist
asks, “Do you believe that Jesus Christ has one nature, one person, and
one will, or two natures, two persons, and two wills, or one will, one
nature, and two persons, or two wills, two persons, and one nature, or
—” but the sage bids him forget such puzzles and be a good Christian. 95
Voltaire points out that Christ, unlike St. Paul and subsequent
Christians, remained faithful to Judaism, despite his criticism of the
Pharisees:</p>
<p>This Eternal God, having made himself a Jew, adheres to the
Jewish</p>
<p>religion during the whole of his life. He performs its functions,
he</p>
<p>frequents the Jewish Temple, he announces nothing contrary to</p>
<p>Jewish Law. All his disciples are Jews and observe the Jewish
cere-</p>
<p>monies. It is certainly not he who established the Christian
religion.</p>
<p>… There is not a single dogma [characteristic] of Christianity
that</p>
<p>was preached by Jesus Chirst. 96</p>
<p>Jesus, in Voltaire’s view, accepted the belief of many pious Jews
before him that the world as they knew it was coming to an end, and
would soon be replaced by the “Kingdom of Heaven”— i.e., the direct rule
of God on earth. (Modern criticism accepts this view.)</p>
<p>In his final years Voltaire responded more and more warmly to the</p>
<p>story of Christ. He began to call him “my brother,” “my master.” 97
He pictured himself as transported in a dream into a desert covered with
heaps</p>
<p>746 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE ( CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>of bones; here the remains of 300,000 massacred Jews, there four
mounds of Christians “strangled because of metaphysical disputes”; and
piles of gold and silver topped with the croziers and crowns of
disintegrated prel- ates and kings. Then his guiding angel took him into
a green valley, where lived the great sages; there he saw Numa
Pompilius, Pythagoras, Zoroaster, Thales, Socrates… Finally</p>
<p>I advanced with my guide into a grove higher than that in which the
sages of antiquity tasted a pleasant repose. I saw a man of sweet and
simple aspect, who seemed to me some thirty-five years old; his feet and
hands swollen and bleeding, his side pierced, his flesh torn with blows
of a whip. There was no comparison between the sufferings of this sage
and those of Socrates.</p>
<p>Voltaire asked him the cause of his death. Jesus replied, “Priests
and judges.” Had he intended to found a new religion? No. Was he
responsible for those mountains of bones, those masses of royal or
sacerdotal gold? No; “I and mine lived in the humblest poverty.” Then in
what did true religion consist? “Have I not told you before? Love God,
and love your neighbor as yourself.” “If this is the case,” said
Voltaire, “I take you for my sole master.” “He made me a sign that
filled me with consolation. The vision disappeared, and I was left with
my conscience at peace.” 98</p>
<p>But that was a later mood. In his war years Voltaire saw the history
of Christianity as predominantly a misfortune for mankind. The mysticism
of Paul, the fables of Gospels canonical or apocryphal, the legends of
martyrs and miracles, and the strategy of priestcraft combined with the
hopeful credulity of the poor to produce the Christian Church. Then the
Fathers of the Church formulated the doctrine in eloquence capable of
satisfying middle-class minds. Bit by bit the light of classic culture
was dimmed by the spread of childish imaginations and pious frauds,
until darkness settled for centuries upon the European mind. Meditative
men, lazy men, men shrinking from the challenges and responsibilities of
life, crept into mon- asteries and infected one another with neurotic
dreams of women, devils, and gods. Learned councils assembled to debate
whether one absurdity or another should become part of the infallible
creed. The Church, basing its power on the popular appetite for
consolatory myths, became stronger than the state basing its authority
on organized force; the power of the sword became dependent upon the
power of the word; popes deposed emperors, and absolved nations from
loyalty to their kings.</p>
<p>In Voltaire’s view the Protestant Reformation was only a halting step
toward reason. He applauded the revolt against monastic mendicants, in-
dulgence peddlers, and moneygrubbing ecclesiastics who in some cases</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 747</p>
<p>“absorbed the whole revenue of a province;” in northern Europe the
“people adopted a cheaper religion.” 99 But he was revolted by the
emphasis placed by Luther and Calvin on predestination ; 100 imagine a
ruler who con- demned two thirds of his subjects to everlasting fire! Or
consider the various Christian interpretations of the Eucharist: the
Catholics profess that they eat God and not bread, the Lutherans eat
both God and bread, the Calvinists eat bread but not God; “if anyone
told us of a like extrava - gance or madness among Hottentots and
Kaffirs, we should think we were being imposed upon.” 101 The advance of
reason is leaving such co ntro- versies far behind; “were Luther and
Calvin to return to the world, they would make no more noise than the
Scotists and the Thomists.” 102 If Protestants continue to preach such a
theology the educated classes will abandon them, while the masses will
prefer the fragrant and colorful faith of Rome. Already, Voltaire
surmised, “Calvinism and Lutheranism are in danger in Germany; that
country is full of great bishoprics, sovereign ab- bacies and canonries,
all proper for making conversions.” 103</p>
<p>Should religion, then, be altogether abandoned by reasonable men? No;
a religion preaching God and virtue, and no other dogmas, would be of
real service to mankind. In earlier years Voltaire had thought that
“those who would need the help of religion to be good men are to be
pitied,” and that a society might live with a natural morality
independent of supernatural beliefs. 104 But as he enlarged his
experience of human passions he came to admit that no moral code could
successfully withstand the primitive force of the individualistic
instincts unless it was buttressed by popular belief that the code had
its source and sanction in an all-seeing, rewarding, and punishing God.
After agreeing with Locke that there are no innate ideas, he fell back
upon Leibniz’ contention that the moral sense is inborn, and he defined
it as a sentiment of justice placed in us by God. “Laws watch over known
crimes, religion over secret crimes.” 103 Says the sage in The Atheist
and the Sage:</p>
<p>I will presume (God forbid it!) that all Englishmen are atheists.
I</p>
<p>will allow that there may be some peaceable citizens, quiet by
nature, rich enough to be honest, regulated by honor, and so attentive
to de- meanor that they contrive to live together in society…. But
the</p>
<p>poor and needy atheist, sure of impunity, would be a fool if he
did</p>
<p>not assassinate or steal to get money. Then would all the bonds
of</p>
<p>society be sundered. All secret crimes would inundate the world, and,
like locusts, though at first imperceptible, would overspread the
earth.</p>
<p>… Who would restrain great kings?… An atheist king is more</p>
<p>dangerous than a fanatical Ravaillac…. Atheism abounded in Italy</p>
<p>in the fifteenth century. What was the consequence? It was as
com-</p>
<p>748</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>mon a matter to poison another as to invite him to supper…. Faith,
then, in a God who rewards good actions, punishes the bad, and for-
gives lesser faults, is most useful to mankind. 106</p>
<p>Finally Voltaire inclined to see some sense in the doctrine of
hell:</p>
<p>To those philosophers who in their writings deny a hell, I will
say:</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, we do not pass our days with Cicero, Atticus, Marcus</p>
<p>Aurelius, Epictetus,… nor with the too scrupulously virtuous</p>
<p>Spinoza, who, although laboring under poverty and destitution, gave
back to the children of the Grand Pensionary de Witt an allowance</p>
<p>of 300 florins which had been granted him by that great statesman —
whose heart, it may be remembered, the Hollanders devoured….</p>
<p>In a word, gentlemen, all men are not philosophers. We are obliged to
hold intercourse and transact business and mix up in life with knaves
possessing little or no reflection, with a vast number of persons
ad-</p>
<p>dicted to brutality, intoxication, and rapine. You may, if you
please,</p>
<p>preach to them that the soul of man is mortal. As for myself, I shall
be sure to thunder in their ears that if they rob me they will
inevitably</p>
<p>be damned. 107</p>
<p>We conclude that the Devil can quote Voltaire to his purpose.
After</p>
<p>appealing for a religion freed from fables, 108 the great skeptic
ended preach- ing the worst fable of all. He had asked for a religion
confined to the in- culcation of morality; 109 now he admitted that
common men cannot be kept from crime except by a religion of heaven and
hell. The Church could claim that he had come to Canossa.</p>
<p>At the age of seventy-two he rephrased his faith under the chastened
title The Ignorant Philosopher (17 66). He confesses at the outset that
he does not know what matter or mind is, nor how he thinks, nor how his
thought can move his arm. 110 He asks himself a question that apparently
never occurred to him before: “Is it necessary for me to know?” But he
adds: “I cannot divest myself of a desire of being instructed; my
baffled curiosity is ever insatiable.” 111 He is now convinced that the
will is not free; “the ignoramus who thinks thus did not always think
so, but he is at length compelled to yield.” 112 “Is there a God?” Yes,
as the Intelligence behind “the order, the prodigious art, and the
mechanical and geometrical</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>749</p>
<p>has always existed, “has ever issued from that primitive and
necessary cause, as light emanates from the sun,” and that “nature has
always been animated.” 115 He still believes that there is design in the
universe, a Provi - dence that guides the whole but lets the part —
including each human in- dividual-shift for itself. 1 16 And he
concludes: “If you tell me that I have taught you nothing, remember that
I set out by informing you that I am ignorant.” 117</p>
<p>The perplexed philosopher began to envy those who had never thought
but had only believed and hoped. And yet he came back to Socrates’ view
that a life without thought is unworthy of a man. He expressed his
hover- ing between these views of life in UHistoire (Tun bon Brahmin
(1761):</p>
<p>In my travels I once happened to meet with an aged Brahmin.</p>
<p>This man had great understanding, great learning,… and great</p>
<p>wealth….</p>
<p>“I wish,” he said to me one day, “I had never been born.”</p>
<p>“Why so?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because I have been studying these forty years, and I find it
has</p>
<p>been so much time lost. Though I teach others, I know nothing…</p>
<p>I exist in time, without knowing what time is. I am placed, as our
wise men say, in the confines between two eternities, and yet have no
idea of eternity. I am composed of matter. I think, but I have never
been able to satisfy myself what it is that produces thought…. I do
not</p>
<p>know why I exist, and yet I am applied to every dav for a solution of
the enigma. I must return an answer, but I can say nothing satisfactory
on the subject. I talk a great deal, and when I have done speaking I</p>
<p>remain confounded, and ashamed of what I have said.”…</p>
<p>The condition in which I saw this good man gave me real concern.</p>
<p>… The same day I had a conversation with an old woman, his</p>
<p>neighbor. I asked her if she had ever been unhappy for not under-</p>
<p>standing how her soul was made. She did not comprehend my ques- tion.
She had not, for the briefest moment in her life, had a thought about
these subjects with which the good Brahmin had so tormented himself. She
believed from the bottom of her heart in the metamor- phoses of her god
Vishnu, and, provided she could get some of the</p>
<p>sacred water of the Ganges in which to make her ablutions, she</p>
<p>hought herself the happiest of women.</p>
<p>Struck with the happiness of this poor creature, I returned to my</p>
<p>philosopher, whom I thus addressed:</p>
<p>“Are you not ashamed to be thus miserable when, not fifty yards</p>
<p>from you, there is an old automaton who thinks of nothing and lives
contented?”</p>
<p>“You are right,” he replied. “I have said to myself a thousand
times</p>
<p>hat I should be happy if I were as ignorant as my old neighbors, and
yet it is a happiness I do not desire.”</p>
<p>750</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>The reply of the Brahmin made a greater impression upon me than</p>
<p>anything that had passed…. I concluded that although we may set</p>
<p>a great value upon happiness, we set a still greater value upon
reason.</p>
<p>But after mature reflection… I still thought there was great mad-</p>
<p>ness in preferring reason to happiness. 118</p>

<li>VOLTAIRE BIGOT</li>
</ol>
<p>In a similar mood Pascal had chosen to submit his logic-ridden
intellect to the Catholic Church as an organization that through long
experience had found a combination of doctrine and ritual helpful to
morality and com- forting to wonder and grief. Voltaire did not go so
far, but in his seventies he moved confusedly in that direction.</p>
<p>He began by reconciling himself to the general desirability of some
re- ligion. When Boswell asked him (December 29, 1764), “Would you have
no public worship?” Voltaire answered, “Yes, with all my heart. Let us
meet four times a year in a great temple, with music, and thank God for
all his gifts. There is one sun, there is one God; let us have one
religion; then all mankind will be brethren.” 119 The sun offered him,
so to speak, a half - way house to God. In May, 1774, aged eighty, he
rose before dawn, and climbed with a friend to see the sunrise from a
nearby hill; perhaps he had been reading Rousseau. Reaching the top
exhausted, and overwhelmed by the glory of the triumphant sun, he knelt
and cried, “O mighty God, I believe!” But, the Voltaire in him
rebounding, he said as he rose to his feet, “As to Monsie ur the Son and
Madame his mother, that is another matter!” 120</p>
<p>Gradually he went further, and consented to allow a clergy, which</p>
<p>would teach morality to the people and offer prayers to God. 121 He
ac- knowledged that the bishops in France and England had done some good
in organizing social order; but cardinals were too expensive, and should
be dispensed with. He had a tender regard for the simple parish priest
who kept the village register, helped the poor, and made peace in
troubled families; these cures should be more respected, better paid,
less exploited by their ecclesiastical superiors. 122 In generous
moments the old penitent was willing to increase the religious
assemblies from four times a year to once a month, even once a week. 123
There should be prayers and thanksgiv- ing, acts of adoration, and
lessons in morality; but no “sacrifice,” no prayers of petition, and let
the sermons be short! If you must have religious pictures or statues,
let them commemorate not dubious saints but the heroes of human- ity,
like Henry IV (saving his mistresses). And no supernatural dogmas ex-
cept the existence of a just God. The ecclesiastical organization should
be subject to the state; the clergy should be trained and paid by the
government.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY 75 1</p>
<p>Monasteries and convents might remain, but only as refuges for the
old or sick. Like so many skeptics, Voltaire had a tender regard for the
nuns who came out of their convents to help the sick and the poor.
Seeing the Sisters of Charity in the hospitals of Paris, he had written,
in the Essai sur les moeurs: “There is not, on all the earth, anything
to equal the sacrifice of beauty, youth, and often high birth, which the
gentle sex offers gladly in order to solace, in the hospitals, the
welter of human suffering…. The nations separated from the Roman faith
have but imperfectly copied so noble a charity.” 124</p>
<p>As “all the world knows,” Voltaire built near his mansion at
Ferney</p>
<p>a little church over whose portal he proudly inscribed the words “Deo
erexit Voltaire.” “This,” he claimed, “is the only church in the
world</p>
<p>dedicated to God alone; all the others are dedicated to saints.” 125
He asked Rome to send him some sacred relics for his chapel; the Pope
sent him a haircloth of St. Francis of Assisi. On the altar Voltaire
placed a life-size gilded-metal statue of Christ, not as the crucified,
but as a sage. There, from 1760 onward, he attended Mass every Sunday;
he had himself cen- sered as seigneur of the village; and at Easter, in
1768, he went to Com- munion. 126 He sent his servants to church
regularly, and paid to have their children taught the catechism. 127</p>
<p>Much of this piety may have been designed to give his villagers a
good example, to encourage them in beliefs that might lessen their
crimes and safeguard his property. He made sure that the court at
Versailles should hear of his exemplary behavior, and perhaps he hoped
that this would facilitate his campaigns for the Calas, the Sirvens, and
La Barre, and his own return to Paris; and indeed the King and the Queen
were pleased to hear of his reform. The Abbe de La Bletterie approved of
Voltaire’s ta king the Sacrament, but remarked, on seeing the
communicant’s emaciation, that Voltaire had forgotten to have himself
buried; to which Voltaire, bow- ing courteously, replied, “After you,
monsieur.” 128 On March 31, 1769, he summoned a notary and signed,
before several witnesses, an affirmation that he wished to die in the
Catholic religion. 129 The freres in Paris laughed at him; he bore their
gibes good-humoredly.</p>
<p>After 1 768 he adopted the monastic custom of having devotional works
read to him at mealtime; for this purpose he preferred the sermons of
Massillon; he could appreciate literature even when it came in a
cassock. He had shared in the campaign against the Jesuits, but in 1770
he joined a lay association of the Capuchin friars, and received from
the head of that order the title pere temporal des capucins de Gex — the
little county in which he was a feudal lord. He was quite proud of this
honor, wrote a dozen letters about it, signed some letters “Frere
Voltaire, capucin indigne.” Fred erick hailed him as a new saint of the
Church, but informed him that the ec-</p>
<p>75 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>clesiastical authorities in Rome had in that same year burned some of
the “unworthy Capuchin’s” works. 130 It is difficult now to discern
whether</p>
<p>In these final years, 1770-78, he devoted his pen rather to
repudiating atheism then to attacking Christianity. Into the article
“God” in the Dic- tionnaire philosophique he inserted two sections in
refutation of d’Holbach’s Systeme de la nature. In 1772 he composed a
vigorous essay, II faut prendre tm Parti (We Must Take Sides), in which
he argued for “God and tolera - tion.” He conf essed to Mme. Necker, to
the Duchesse de Choiseul, to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, his
fear that the movement for re- ligious toleration would be defeated by
the advocacy of atheism. He re- gretted that his criticism of d’Holbach
was endangering the solidarity of the freres, but he persisted: “I have
no doubt that the author, and three</p>
<p>servants and peasants at Femey.</p>
<p>In the last decade of his life the men whom he had once hailed
and</p>
<p>spurred on as brothers in the campaign against Finfame looked upon
him as a lost leader. Diderot had never loved him, had never taken to
corre- sponding with him, had resented Voltaire’s evident assumption
that d’Alem - bert was the chief and soul of the Encyclopedic. Diderot
applauded the defense of Calas, but he let slip a jealous line: “This
man is never more than</p>
<p>skimmed the surface of these matters.” 133 And now the atheists of
Paris, growing in number and pride, turned their backs upon Voltaire. So
early as 1765, even amid the battle against Finfame, one of them
dismissed him with scorn: “ 7 / est un bigot, c’est un deiste.” 13i</p>
<p>Buffeted from both sides, the frail patriarch began, toward 1770, to
lose fait h in the prospects of victory. He called himself a “great
destroyer” who had built nothing. 135 His new religion of “God and
tolerance,” he feared.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE AND CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>753</p>
<p>would come only when rulers would accept the Abbe de Saint- Pierre’s
“project for perpetual peace”— i.e., probably never at all. He had long
sus- pected the frailty of philosophy and the unattractiveness of
reason. “No philosopher has influenced the mann ers of even the street
he lived in.” 130 He surrendered the masses to “superstition” or
mythology. He hoped to win some “forty thousand sages” in France, and
the educated strata of the middle class; but even this hope began to
fade in the twilight of his years. “To enlighten the young, bit by bit”—
this was all the dream that was left to him as he prepared, aged
eighty-four, to see Paris and die. Perhaps, in the marvelous welcome
that he was destined to receive there, his faith and hope in man would
return.</p>
<p>Was he a philosopher? Yes, though he made no system, vacillated on
everything, and too often remained on the surface of things. He was not
a philosopher if the word means the maker of a system of unified and
con- sistent thought about the world and man. He turned away from
systems as the impudent sallies of the minuscle into the infinite. But
he was a philosopher if that means a mind seriously occupied with the
basic problems of nature, morals, government, life, and destiny. He was
not considered profound, but perhaps that was because he was uncertain
and clear. His ideas were seldom original, but in philosophy nearly all
original ideas are foolish, and lack of originality is a sign of wisdom.
Certainly the form that he gave to his ideas was original; Voltaire is
without question the most brilliant writer that ever lived. Was he
second in every field, as Diderot charged? Second in philosophy to
Diderot, yes, and in drama to Corneille and Racine; but he was first and
best in his time in his conception and writ- ing of history, in the
grace of his poetry, in the charm and wit of his prose, in the range of
his thought and his influence. His spirit moved like a flame over the
continent and the century, and stirs a million souls in every gen-
eration.</p>
<p>Perhaps he hated too much, but we must remember the provocation; we
must imagine ourselves back in an age when men were burned at the stake,
or broken on the wheel, for deviating from orthodoxy. We can appreciate
Christianity better today than he could then, because he fought with
some success to moderate its dogmas and violence. We can feel the power
and splendor of the Old Testament, the beauty and elevation of the New,
be- cause we are free to think of them as the labor and inspiration of
fallible men. We can be grateful for the ethics of Christ, because he no
longer threatens us with hell, nor curses the men and cities that will
not hear him. 137 We can feel the nobility of St. Francis of Assisi,
because we are no longer asked to believe that St. Francis Xavier was
heard in several languages while he spoke in one. We can feel the poetry
and drama of re-</p>

<p>ligious ritual now that the transient triumph of toleration leaves us
free to worship or abstain. We can accept a hundred legends as profound
symbols or illuminating allegories, because we are no longer required to
accept their literal truth. We have learned to sympathize with that
which we once loved and had to leave, as we retain a tender memory for
the loves of our youth. And to whom, more than to any other one man, do
we owe this precious and epochal liberation? To Voltaire.</p>
