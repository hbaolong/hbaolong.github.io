<p>XThe Common Culture of Early Greece</p>
<p>I. THE INDIVIDUALISM OF THE STATE</p>
<p>T he two rival zeniths of European culture — ancient Hellas and
Renais- sance Italy — rested upon no larger political organization than
the city- state. Geographical conditions presumably contributed to this
result in Greece. Everywhere mountains or water intervened; bridges were
rare and roads were poor; and though the sea was an open highway, it
bound the city with its commercial associates rather than with its
geographical neighbors. But geography does not altogether explain the
city-state. There was as much separatism between Thebes and Plataea, on
the same Boeotian plain, as between Thebes and Sparta; more between
Sybaris and Crotona on the same Italian shore than between Sybaris and
Syracuse. Diversity of economic and political interest kept the cities
apart; they fought one an- other for distant markets or grain, ,or
formed rival alliances for control of the sea. Distinctions of origin
helped to divide them; the Greeks consid- ered themselves to be all of
one race,^ but their tribal divisions — Aeolian, Ionian, Achaean, Dorian
— were keenly felt, and Athens and Sparta disliked each other with an
ethnological virulence worthy of our own age. Differ- ences of religion
strengthened, as they were strengthened by, political divi- sions. Out
of the unique cults of locality and clan came ^tinct festivals and
calendars, distinct customs and laws, distinct tribunals, even distinct
frontiers; for the boundary stones limited the realm of the god as well
as of the community; cujus repo, ejus religio. These and many other
factors united to produce the Greek city-state.</p>
<p>It was not a new administrative form: we have seen that there were
city- states in Sumeria, Babylonia, Phoenicia, and Crete hundreds or
thousands of years before Homer or Pericles. Historically the city-state
was the vil- lage community in a higher stage of fusion or development —
a common market, meeting ground, and judgment seat for men tilling the
same hin- terland, belonging to the same stock, and worshiping the same
god. Po- litically it was to the Greek the best available compromise
between those two hostile and fluctuating components of human society —
order and lib-</p>

<p>Xerty; a smaller community would have been insecure, a larger one
tyran- nical. Ideally — in the aspirations of philosophers — Greece was
to consist of sovereign city-states co-operating in a Pythagorean
harmony. Aristotle conceived the state as an association of freemen
acknowledging one gov- ernment and capable of meeting in one assembly; a
state with more than ten thousand citizens, he thought, would be
impracticable. In the Gltek language one word — po//r — sufficed for
both city and state.</p>
<p>All the world knows that this political atomism brought to Hellas
many a tragedy of fraternal strife. Because Ionia was unable to unite
for defense it fell subject to Persia; because Greece, despite
confederacies and leagues, was unable to stand together, the freedom
which it idolized was in the end destroyed. And yet Greece would have
been impossible without the city-state. Only through this sense of civic
individuality, this exuberant assertion of independence, this diversity
of institutions, customs, arts, and gods, was Greece stimulated, by
competition and emulation, to live human life with a zest and fullness
and creative originality that no other society had ever known. Even in
our own times, with all our vitality and variety, our mechanisms and
powers, is there any community of like population or extent that pours
into the stream of civilization such a profusion of gifts as flowed from
the chaotic liberty of the Greeks?</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>LETTERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless there were common factors in the life of these
watchfully separatist states. As far back as the thirteenth century b.c.
we find one lan- guage throughout the Greek peninsula. It belonged to
the “Indo - European” group, like Persian and Sanskrit, Slavonic and
Latin, German and English; ^ousands of words denoting the primary
relations or objects of life have com- mon roots in these tongues, and
suggest not only the predispersion antiquity of the things denoted, but
the kinship or association of the peoples who used them in the dawn of
history.* It is true that the Greek language was diversi- fied into
dialects — Aeolic, Doric, Ionic, Attic; but these were mutually intelli-
gible, and yielded, in the fifth and fourth centuries, to a koine
dialektos, or common dialect, which emanated principally from Athens,
and was spoken by nearly all the educated classes of the Hellenic world.
Attic Greek was a noble tongue, vigorous, supple, melodious; as
irregular as any vital speech, but lending itself readily to expressive
combinations, delicate gradations and dis-</p>

<p>tinctions of meaning, subde philosophical conceptions, and every
variety of literary excellence from the “many - billowed surge” of
Homer’s verse to the placid flow of Plato’s prose.*</p>
<p>Greek tradition attributed the introduction of writing into Greece to
Phoe- nicians in the fourteenth century b.c., and we know nothing to the
contrary. The oldest Greek inscriptions, dating from the eighth and
seventh centuries, show a close resemblance to the Semitic characters on
the ninth-century Moabite stone.® These inscriptions were written, in
Semitic fashion, from right to left; sixth-century inscriptions (e.g.,
at Gortyna) were made alternately from right to left and from left to
right; later inscriptions are from left to right through- out, and
certain letters are turned around accordingly, as 3 and 3 to B and E.
The Semitic names for the letters were adopted with minor
modifications;t but the Greeks made several basic changes. Above all,
they added vowels, which the Semites had omitted; certain Semitic
characters denoting consonants or breathings were used to represent i,
o, and u. Later the lonians added the long vowels eta (long e) and
o-mega (long or double o). Ten different Greek alphabets struggled for
ascendancy as part of the war of the city-states; in Greece the Ionian
form prevailed, and was transmitted to eastern Europe, where it survives
today; in Rome the Chalcidian form was adopted from Cumae to become the
Latin alphabet, and ours. The Chalcidic alphabet lacked the long e and
o, but, unlike the Ionian, retained the Phoenician vau as a con- sonant
(a V with approximately the sound of w); hence the Athenians called wine
oinos, the Chalcidians called it voinoSy the Romans called it vinum, we
call it wine. Chalcis kept the Semitic koppa or q, and passed it on to
Rome and ourselves; Ionia abandoned it, content with k. Ionia
represented L as A, Chalcis as L; Rome straightened up the latter form
and gave it to Europe. The lonians used P for R, but in Greek Italy the
P sprouted a tail, and became R.®</p>
<p>The earliest uses of writing in Greece were probably commercial or
religious; apparently priestly charms and chants are the mother of
poetry, and bills of lading are the father of prose. Writing split into
two varieties: the formal for literary or epigraphic purposes, the
cursive for ordinary use. There were no accents, no spaces between
words, no punctuation points;® but a change of topic was marked off by a
horizontal dividing stroke called the paragraphos — i.e., a si gn
“written on the side.” The materials used to receive writing were -</p>
<p>• We do not know how ancient Greek was pronounced.* The accents that
trouble us so much were seldom used by the classical Greeks, but were
inserted into ancient texts by Aristophanes of Byzantium in the third
century b.c. These accents should be ignored in reading Greek
poetry.</p>
<p>fCf. Greek alpha, Phoenician aleph (bull); beta, beth (tent); gamma,
gimel (camel); delta, daleth (door); e-psilon, he (window); zeta, zain

<p>tions, stone, bronze, or lead; for ordinary writing, clay tablets as
in Mesopo- tamia;* * * § then wooden tablets covered with wax, which
were popular, in retro- spect, with schoolboys;’ for more permanent
purposes papyrus, which the Phoenicians brought from Egypt, and (in the
Hellenistic and Roman periods) parchment, made from the skins or
membranes of goats or sheep. A metal stylus was used on wax tablets; on
papyrus or parchment a reed dipped in ink. Wax writing was erased with
the flat butt of the stylus, ink with a sponge; so the poet Martial sent
a sponge with his poems to his friend, so that they might be wiped out
with a stroke.^ Many a critic will mourn the passing of this
courte^.</p>
<p>In no field have the old words so regularly come down to us as in
that of writing. Papery of course, is papyruSy and once again, in the
cycle of fashion, the substance is a compressed plant. A line of writing
was a stichos or row; the Latins called it a versus or verse — i.e., a
turning back. The text was written in columns upon a strip of papyrus or
parchment from twenty to thirty feet long, wound about a stick. Such a
roll was called a bibloSy from the Phoenician city, so named, whence
papyrus came to Greece. A smaller roll was called biblion; our Bible was
originally ta bibliay the rolls.t When a roll formed part of a larger
work it was called a tomoSy or cutting. The first sheet of a roll was
called the protokollon — i.Q.y the first sheet glued to the stick. The
edgesf of the roll were smoothed with pumice and sometimes colored; if
the author could alFordrthe expense, or the roll contained important
matter, it might be wrapped in a diphthera (membrane), or, as the Latins
called it, a vellum. Since a large roll would be inconvenient for
handling or reference, literary works were usually divided into several
rolls, and the word bibloSy or book, was applied not to each work as a
whole, but to each roll or part. These divisions were seldom made by the
author; later editors divided the Histories of Herodotus into nine
books, the Peloponnesian War of Thucydides into eight, Plato’s 2?e -
public into ten, the Iliad and the Odyssey into twenty-four. Since
papyrus was costly, and each copy had to be written by hand, books were
very limited in the classic world; it was easier than now to be
educated, though as hard as now to be intelligent. Reading was not a
universal accomplishment; most knowL edge was handed down by oral
tradition from one generation or craftsman to the next; most literature
was read aloud by trained reciters to persons who learned through the
ear.§ There was no reading public in Greece before the seventh century;
there were no Greek libraries till diose collected by Polycrates</p>

engrave.</p>
<p>t The Latins called a roll wound up.</p>
<p>4: Latin jrontes, whence our frontispiece.</p>
<p>§ Though we have been eye-minded since the development of printing,
and writing is seldom read aloud, style and punctuation are sdll formed
with a view to easy breathing in the reader, and a rhythmic sound in the
words. Probably our descendants will be ear- minded again.</p>
<p>CHAP.K) the common culture of early GREECE 207</p>
<p>and Peisistratus in the sixth.* In the fifth century we hear of the
private libraries of Euripides and the archon Eucleides; in the fourth,
of Aristotle’s. We know of no publi c library before Alexandria’s, none
in Athens till Hadrian.“ Perhaps the Greeks of Pericles’ day were so
great because they did not have to read many books, or any long one.</p>
<p>HI. LITERATURE</p>
<p>Literature, like religion, divided and united Greece. The poets sang
in their local dialects, and often of their native scenes; but all
Hellas listened to the more eloquent voices, and stirred them now and
then to broader themes. Time and prejudice have destroyed too much of
this early poetry to let us feel its wealth and scope, its reputed vigor
of utterance and finish of form; but as we move through the isles or
cities of sixth-century Greece our wonder rises at the abundance and
excellence of Greek literature be- fore the Peiiclean age. The lyric
poetry reflected an aristocratic society in which feeling, thought, and
morals were free so long as they observed the amenities of breeding;
this style of urbane and polished verse tended to disappear under the
democracy. It had a rich variety of structure and meter, but seldom
shackled itself with rhyme; poetry meant to the Greeks, feeling ima gina
tively and rhythmically expressed.*</p>
<p>While the lyric singers tuned their lyres to love and war, the
wander- ing bards, in great men’s halls, recited in epic measu res the
heroic deeds of the race. Guilds of “rhapsodes”t built up through
generations a cycle of lays centering around the sieges of Thebes and
Troy and the homing of the warriors. Song was socialized among these
minstrels; each stitched his story together from earlier fragments, and
none pretended to have com- posed a whole sequence of these tales. In
Chios a clan of such rhapsodes called themselves Homeridae, and claimed
descent from a poet Homer who, they said, was the author of the epics
that they recited throughout eastern Greece.“ Perhaps this blind bard
was but an eponym, the imag- inary ancestor of a tribe or group, like
Hellen, Dorus, or Ion.“ The Greefe</p>
<p>• Rhyme was mostly confined to oracles and religious prophecies,</p>

<p>2o8</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. DC</p>
<p>sixth-century Athens — possibly under Solon,“ probably under
Peisistratus — a governmental commission selected or collated the Iliad
and the Odyssey from the epic literature of the preceding centuries,
assigned them to Homer, and edited — perhaps wove — them into
substantially their present shape.“</p>
<p>It is one of the miracles of literature that poems so complex in
origin achieved in the end so artistic a result. It is quite true that
both in language and in structure the Iliad falls considerably this side
of perfection: that Aeolian and Ionic forms are mingled as if by some
polyglot Smyman, and that the meter requires now one dialect and now the
other; that the plot is marred by inconsistencies, changes of plan and
emphasis, and contradic- tions of character; that the same heroes are
killed two or three times over in the course of the tale; that the
original theme — the wrath of Achilles and its results — is interrupted
and obscured by a hundred episodes apparently taken from other lays and
sewn into the epic at every seam. Nevertheless, in its larger aspects
the story is one, the language is powerful and vivid, the poem is aU in
^ “the greatest that ever sounded on the lips of men.”“ Such an epic
could have been begun only in the active and exuberant youth of the
Greeks, and could have been completed only in their artistic maturity.
Its characters are nearly all warriors or their women; even the
philosophers, like Nestor, put up an enviably good fight. These
individuals are intimately and sympathetically conceived; and perhaps
the finest thing in all Greek literature is the unbiased manner in which
we are made to feel now with Hector and now with Achilles. In his tent
Achilles is a thoroughly unheroic and unlikable figure, complaining to
his mother that his luck does not befit his semidivinity, and that
Agamemnon has stolen his plum, the unhappy Briseis; letting the Greeks
die by the thousands while he eats and pouts and sleeps in his ship or
his tent; sending Patroclus unaided to death, and then rending the air
with unmanly lamentations. When finally he goes into battle he is not
stirred by patriotism but mad with grief over the loss of his friend. In
his rage he loses all decency, and sinks to savage cruelty with both
Lycaon and Hector. In truth he is an undeveloped mind, un- settled and
uncontrolled, and overshadowed with prophecies of death. “Nay, friend,”
he says to the fallen Lycaon, who sues for mercy, “die like another!
What wovddst thou vainly weeping? Patroclus died, who was far better
than thou. Look upon me! Am I not beautiful and tall, and sprung of a
good father, and a goddess the mother that bare me? Yet, lo. Death is
over me, and the mighty hand of Doom. There cometh a dawn of day, a noon
or an evening, and a hand that I know not shall lay me dead.’”* So he
stabs the unresisting Lycaon through the neck, flings Ae body into</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 209</p>
<p>the river, and makes one of those grandiose speeches that adorn the
slaugh- ter in the Iliad, and laid the foundation for oratory among the
Greeks. Half of Hellas worshiped Achilles for centuries as a god;” we
accept him, and forgive him, as a child. At the worst he is one of the
supreme creations of the poetic mind.</p>
<p>What carries us along through the Iliad when we do not have to study
or translate it is not merely these characterizations, so numerous and
diverse, nor merely the flow and turmoil of the tale, but the rushing
splendor of the verse. It must be admitted that Homer repeats as well as
nods; it is part of his plan to recall as in refrain certain epithetis
and lines; so he sings with fond repetition, of Emos d^erigefieia phone
rhododactylos “when ap - peared the morning’s daughter, rosy - fingered
Dawn.”“ But if these are flaws they are lost in the brilliance of the
language, and the wealth of similes that now and then, amid the shock of
war, calm us with the quiet beauty of peaceful fields. “As when flies in
swarming myriads haunt the herds - man’s stalls in spring time, when new
milk has filled the pails— in such vast multitudes mustered the long-
haired Greeks upon the plain.”” Or ’</p>
<p>As when, among</p>
<p>The deep dells of an arid mountain-side,</p>
<p>A great fire bums its way, and the thick wood</p>
<p>Before it is consumed, and shifting winds</p>
<p>Hither and thither sweep the flames — so ranged</p>
<p>Achilles in his fury through the field</p>
<p>From side to side, and everywhere o’ertook</p>
<p>His victims, and the earth ran dark with blood.®</p>
<p>The Odyssey is so different from all this that from the outset one
suspects its separate authorship. Even some of the Alexandrian scholars
suggested this, and all the critical authority of Aristarchus was
required to hush the dispute.® The Odyssey agrees with the Iliad in
certain standard phrases — “owl - eyed Athena,” “long - haired Greeks,”
“wine - dark sea,” “rosy -fingered Dawn”— which may have been taken from
the same hoard and poetical tradition into which the authors of the
Iliad had dipped their pens. But the Odyssey contains an array of words
apparently brought into use after the Iliad was composed.® In the second
epic we hear frequently of iron, where the earlier one spoke of bronze;
we hear of writing, of private property in land, of freedmen and
emancipation — none of which are mentioned in the Iliad; the very gods
and their functions are different.® The meter is the same dactylic
hexameter, as in all the Greek epics; but the style and spirit</p>
<p>210 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xand substance are so far from the Iliad that if one author wrote
both poems he was a paragon of complexity and a master of all moods. The
new poet is more literary and philosophical, less violent and warlike,
than the old; more self-conscious and meditative, leisurely and
civilized; so gentle, in- deed, that Bentley thought the Odyssey had
been composed for the special benefit of w omen.”</p>
<p>Whether here too we have poets rather than a poet is harder to say
than in the case of the Iliad. There are signs of suture, but the
stitching seems more skillful than in the older epic; the plot, though
devious, turns out in the end to be remarkably consistent, worthy almost
of contemporary fictioneers. From the beginning the conclusion is
foreshadowed, every episode advances it, and its coming binds all the
books into a whole. Prob- ably the epic was built upon pre-existing
lays, as in the case of the Iliad; but the work of unification is far
more complete. We may conclude with a high degree of diffidence that the
Odyssey is a century younger than the Iliad, and is predominantly the
work of one man.</p>
<p>The characters are less vigorously and vividly conceived than in
the</p>
<p>Iliad. Penelope is shadowy, and never quite emerges from behind her
loom except in the end, when a moment of doubt, perhaps of regret, flits
through her mind at the return of her master. Helen is clearer, and
unique; here the launcher of a thousand ships and the cause of ten
thousand deaths is still “a goddess among women,” maturely lovely in her
middle age, gentler and quieter than before, but as proud as ever, and
taking gracefully for granted all the attentions that hedge in a queen.”
Nausicaa is a pretty essay in the male understanding of women; we hardly
expected so delicate and romantic a picture from a Greek. Telemachus is
uncertainly drawn, in- fected with hesitation as by some Hamlet touch;
but Odysseus is the most complete and complex portrait in Greek poetry.
All in all, the Odyssey is a fascinating novel in engaging verse, full
of tender sentiment and adven- turous surprise; more interesting, to an
unwarlike and aging soul, than the majestic and bloody Iliad.</p>
<p>These poems — sole survivors of a long succession of epics — became
the most precious element in the literary heritage of Greece. “Homer”
was the staple of Greek education, the repository of Greek myth, the
source of a thousand dramas, the foundation of moral training, and —
strangest of all — the very Bible of orthodox theology. It was Homer and
Hesiod, said Herodotus (probably with some hyperbole), who gave definite
and human form to the Olympians, and order to the hierarchy of heaven.”
There is much that is magnificent in Homer’s gods, and we come to like
them for</p>
<p>ZII</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE</p>
<p>their failings; but scholars have long since detected in the poets
who pic- tured them a rollicking skepticism hardly befitting a nationd
Bible. These deities quarrel like relatives, fornicate like fleas, and
share with mankind what seemed to Alexander the stigmata of mortality —
the need for love and sleep; they do everything human but hunger and
die. Not one of them could bear comparison with Odysseus in
intelligence, with Hector in hero- ism, with Andromache in tenderness,
or with Nestor in dignity. Only a poet of the sixth century, versed in
Ionian doubt, could have made such farcehngs of the gods.®’ It is one of
the humors of history that these epics, in which the Olympians have
essentially the function of comic relief, were reverenced throughout
Hellas as props of respectable morality and belief. Eventually the
anomaly proved explosive; the humor destroyed the belief, and the moral
development of men rebelled against the superseded morals of the
gods.</p>

<p>Religion failed to unify Greece, but athletics — periodically —
succeeded. Men went to Olympia, Delphi, Corinth, and Nemea not so much
to honor the gods — for these could be honored anywhere — as to witness
the heroic contests of chosen athletes, and the ecumenical assemblage of
varied Greeks. Alexander, who could see Greece from without, considered
Olympia the capital of the Greek world.</p>
<p>Here under the rubric of athletics we find the real religion of the
Greeks —the worship of health, beauty, and strength. “To be in health,”
said Simonides, “is the best thing for man; the next best, to be of form
and nature beautiful; the third, to enjoy wealth gotten without fraud;
and the fourth, to be in youth’s bloom among friends.”®’* “There is no
greater glory for a man as long as he lives,” said the Odyssey^ “than
that which he wins by his own hands and feet.” Perhaps it was necessary
for an aristocrati c people, living among slaves more numerous than
themselves and frequently called upon to defend their soil against more
populous nations, to keep in good condition. Ancient war depended upon
physical vigor and skill, and these were the original aim of the
contests that filled Hellas with the noise of their fame. We must not
think of the average Greek as a student and lover of Aeschylus or Plato;
rather, like the typical Briton or American, he was interested in sport,
and his favored athletes were his earthly gods.</p>
<p>Greek games were private, local, municipal, and Panhellenic. Even the
fragmentary remains of antiquity reveal an interesting range of
sports-</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XA relief in the Athens Museum shows on one side a wrestling match,
on another a hockey game.® Swimming, bareback riding, throwing or
dodging missiles while mounted, were not so much sports as general
accomplish- ments of all citizens. Hunting became a sport when it ceased
to be a neces- sity. Ball games were as varied then as now, and as
popular; at Sparta the terms ballplayer and youth were synonyms. Special
rooms were built in the palaestra for games of ball; these rooms were
called sphairisteria, and the teachers were sphcdristcd. On another
relief we see men bouncing a ball against the floor or the wall, and
striking it back with the flat of the hand;“ we do not know whether the
players did this in turn as in modem handball. One ball game resembled
Canadian lacrosse, being a form of hockey played with racquets. Pollux,
writing in the second century of our era, describes it in almost modem
terms:</p>
<p>(Certain youths, divided into two equal groups, leave in a level</p>
<p>place — which they have prepared and measured — a ball made of</p>
<p>leather, about the size of an apple. They rush at it, as if it were
a</p>
<p>prize lying between them, from their fixed starting-points. Each</p>
<p>of them has in his right hand a racquet {rhabdon) . . . ending in
a</p>
<p>sort of flat bend whose center is woven with gut strings . . .
plaited</p>
<p>like a net. Each side strives to be the first to drive the ball to Ae
op-</p>
<p>posite end of the ground from that allotted to them.“</p>
<p>The same author pictures a game in which one team tries to throw a
ball over or through an opposed group, “until one side drives the other
back over their god line.” Antiphanes, in an imperfect fragment from
the</p>
<p>fourth century b.c., describes a “star”: “When he got the ball he de
- lighted to give it to one player while dodging another; he knocked it
away from one and urged on another with noisy cries. Outside, a long
pass, be- yond him, overhead, a short pass. . . .”“</p>
<p>From these private sports came local and incidental games, as after
the death of a hero like Patroclus, or the successful issue of some
great enter- pr ise, like the march of Xenophon’s Ten Thousand to the
sea. Then came</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 213</p>
<p>represented by twenty-four men chosen for their health, vigor, and
good looks; and a prize was awarded to the most impressive twenty- four
for “fine manhood.””</p>
<p>Since athletics were necessary for war, and yet would die without
com- petitions, the cities of Greece, to provide the highest stimulus,
arranged Panhellenic games. The oldest of these were organized as a
regular quad- rennial event at Olympia in 776 b.c. — the first definite
date in Greek history. Originally confined to Eleans, within a century
they were drawing entries from all Greece; by 476 the list of victors
ranged from Sinope to Marseilles. The feast of Zeus became an
international holyday; a truce was proclaimed to all wars in Greece for
the month of the festival, and fines were levied by the Eleans upon any
Greek state in whose territory a traveler to the games suffered
molestation. Philip of Macedon humbly paid a fine because some of his
soldiers had robbed an Athenian en route to Olympia.</p>
<p>We picture the pilgrims and athletes starting out from distant
cities, a month ahead of time, to come together at the games. It was a
fair as well as a festival; the plain was covered not only with the
tents that sheltered the visitors from the July heat, but with the
booths where a thousand con- cessionaires exposed for sale everything
from wine and fruit to horses and statuary, while acrobats and conjurors
performed their tricks for the crowd. Some juggled balls in the air,
others performed marvels of agility and skill, others ate fire or
swallowed swords: modes of amusement, like forms of superstition, enjoy
a reverend antiquity. Famous orators like Gorgias, famous sophists like
Hippias, perhaps famous writers like Herodotus, de- livered addresses or
recitations from the porticoes of the temple of Zeus. It was a special
holiday for men, since married women were not allowed to attend the
festival; these had their ovra games at the feast of Hera. Menander
summed up such a scene in five words: “crowd, market, acro - bats,
amusements, thieves.””</p>
<p>Only freeborn Greeks were allowed to compete in the Olympic games.
The athletes (from athlos, a contest) were selected by local and
municipal elimination trials, after which they submitted for ten months
to rigorous training under professional paidotribai (literally, youth
rubbers) and gym- nastai. Arrived at Olympia, they were examined by the
officials, and took an oath to observe all the rules. Irregularities
were rare; we hear of</p>
<p>Eupolis bribing other boxers to lose to him,” but the penalty and
dishonor attached to such offenses were discouragingly great. When
everything was ready the athletes were led into the stadium; as they
entered, a herald announced their names and the cities that had entered
them. All the con-</p>

<p>214</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xtestants, whatever their age or rank, were naked; occasionally a
girdle might be worn at the loins.” Of the stadium itself nothing
remains but the narrow stone slabs toed by the runners at the starting
point. The 45,000 spectators kept their places in the stadium all day
long, suffering from in- sects, heat, and thirst; hats were forbidden,
the water was bad, and flies and mosquitoes infested the place as they
do today. Sacrifices were offered at frequent intervals to Zeus Averter
of Flies.“</p>
<p>The most important events were grouped together as the pentathlon, or
five contests. To promote all-around development in the athlete each
entry in any of these events was required to compete in all of them; to
secure the victory it was necessary to win three contests out of the
five. The first was a broad jump; the athlete held weights like
dumbbells in his hands, and leaped from a standing start. Ancient
writers assure us that some jumpers spanned fifty feet;” but it is not
necessary to believe everything that we read. The second event was
throwing the discus, a circular plate of metal or stone weighing about
twelve pounds; the best throws are said to have covered a hundred feet.”
The third contest was in hurling the javelin or spear, with the aid of a
leather thong attached to the center of the shaft. The fourth and
principal event of the group was the stadium sprint — i.e., for the
length of the stadium, usually some two hundred yards. The fifth contest
was wrestling. It was a highly popular form of competi- tion in Greece,
for the very name palaistra was taken from it, and many a story was told
of its champions.</p>
<p>Boxing was an ancient game, almost visibly handed down from Minoan
Crete and Mycenaean Greece. The boxers practiced with punching balls
hung on a level with the head and filled with fig seeds, meal, or sand.
In the classic age of Greece (i.e., the fifth and fourth centuries),
they wore “soft gloves” of oxhide dressed with fat and reaching almost
to the elbow. Blows were confined to the head, but there was no rule
against hitting a man who was down. There were no rests or rounds; the
boxers fought till one surrendered or succumbed. They were not
classified by weight; any man of any weight might enter the lists. Hence
weight was an asset, and boxing degenerated in Greece from a competition
in skill into a contest in brawn.</p>
<p>In the course of time, as brutality increased, boxing and wrestling
were combined into a new contest called the pankration, or game of all
powers. In this everything but biting and eye-gouging was permitted,
even to a kick in the stomach.“ Three heroes whose names have come down
to us won by breaking the fingers of their opponents;“ another struck so
fero-</p>
<p>CHAP.rx) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 2lg</p>
<p>ciously witli straight extended fingers and strong sharp nails that
he pierced the flesh o f his adversary and dragged out his bowels.“ Milo
of Crotona was a more amiable pugilist. He had developed his strength,
we are told, by carrying a calf every day of its life until it was a
full-grown bull. Peo- ple loved him for his tricks: he would hold a
pomegranate so fast in his fist that no one could get it from him, and
yet the fruit was uninjured; he would stand on an oUed quoit and resist
all efforts to dislodge him; he would tie a cord around lus forehead and
burst the cord by holding his breath and so forcing blood to his head.
In the end he was destroyed by his virtues. “For he chanced,” says
Pausanias, “on a withered tree, into which some wedges had been driven
to separate the wood, and he took it into his head to keep the wood
apart with his hands. But the wedges slipped out, he was imprisoned in
the tree, and became a prey to the wolves.”“</p>
<p>In addition to the pentathlon sprint, there were other foot races at
the games. One was for four hundred yards, another for twenty-four
stadia, or 2 yj miles; a third was an armed race, in which each runner
carried a heavy shield. We have no knowledge of the records made in
these races; the stadium differed in length in different cities, and the
Greeks had no instruments for measuring small intervals of time. Stories
tell of a Greek runner who could outdistance a hare; of another who
raced a horse from Coronea to Thebes (some twenty miles) and beat it;
and of how Pheidip- pides ran from Athens to Sparta — 150 miles — in two
days“ and, at the cost of his life, brought to Athens the news of the
victory at Marathon, twenty- four miles away. But there were no
“marathon races” in Greece.</p>
<p>In the plain below the stadium Olympia built a special hippodrome for
horse races. Women as well as men might enter their horses, and, as now,
the prize went to the owner and not to the jockey, though the horse was
sometimes rewarded with a statue.“ The culminating events of the games
were the chariot races, with two or four horses running abreast. Often
ten four-horse chariots competed together; and as each had to negotiate
twenty- three turns around the posts at the ends of the course,
accidents were the chief thrill of the game; in one race with forty
starters a single chariot fin- ished. We may imagine the tense
excitement of the spectators at these contests, their wordy arguments
about their favorites, their emotional aban- donment as the survivors
rounded the last turn.</p>
<p>When the toils of five days were over the victors received their
rewards. Each bound a woolen fillet about his head, and upon this the
judges placed</p>
<p>2i6</p>
<p>ThE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xa crown of wild olive, while a herald announced the name and city of
the winner. This laurel wreath was the only prize given at the Olympic
games, and yet it was the most eagerly contested distinction in Greece.
So im- portant were the games that not even the Persian invasion stopped
them; and while a handful of Greeks withstood Xerxes’ army at
Thermopylae the customary thousands watched Theagenes of Thasos, on the
very day of the battle, win the pancratiast’s crown. “Good heavens!”
exclaimed a Per - sian to his general; “what manner of men are these
against whom you have brought us to fight.? — men who contend with one
another not for money but for honor!”“ He, or the Greek inventor of the
tale, did the Greeks too much credit, and not merely because the Greeks
should on that day have been at Thermopylae rather than at Olympia.
Though the direct prize at the games was little, the indirect rewards
were great. Many cities voted substantial sums to the victors on their
return from their triumphs; some cities made them generals; and the
crowd idolized them so openly that jealous philosophers complained.“
Poets like Simonides and Pindar were engaged by the victor or his
patrons to write odes in his honor, which were sung by choruses of boys
in the procession that welcomed him home; sculptors were paid to
perpetuate him in bronze or stone; and sometimes he was given free
sustenance in the city hall. We may judge the cost of this item when we
learn, on questionable authority, that Milo ate a four- year-old heifer,
and Theagenes an ox, in a day.“</p>
<p>The sixth century saw the peak of the splendor and popularity of ath-
letics in Greece. In 582 the Amphictyonic League established the Pythian
games in honor of Apollo at Delphi; in the same year the Isthmian games
were instituted at Corinth in honor of Poseidon; six years later the
Nemean games were inaugurated to celebrate tfie Nemean Zeus; and all
three occa- sions became Panh’ellenic festivals. Together with the
Olympic games they formed a periodos, or cycle, and the great ambition
of a Greek athlete was to win the crown at all of them. In the Pythian
games contests in music and poetry were added to the physical
competitions; and indeed such musi- cal tilts had been celebrated at
Delphi long before the establishment of the athletic games. The original
event was a hymn in honor of Apollo’s vic - tory over the Delphic
python; in 582 contests were added in singing, and in playing the lyre
and the flute. Similar musical contests were held at Corinth, Nemea,
Delos, and elsewhere; for the Greeks believed that by frequent public
competitions they could stimulate not only the ability of the performer
but the taste of the public as well. The principle was ap-</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE</p>
<p>plied to almost every art — to pottery, poetry, sculpture, painting,
choral singing, oratory, and drama.“ In this way and others the games
had a pro- found influence upon art and literature, and even upon the
writing of his- tory; for the chief method of reckoning time, in later
Greek historiography, was by Olympiads, designated by the name of the
victor in the one-stadium foot race. The physical perfection of the
all-around athlete in the sixth century generated that ideal of statuary
which reached its fullness in Myron and Polycleitus. The nude contests
and games in the palaestra and at the festivals gave the sculptor
unequaled opportunities to study the human body in every natural form
and pose; the nation unwittingly became mod- els to its artists, and
Greek athletics united with Greek religion to generate Greek art.</p>
<p>V. ARTS</p>
<p>Now that we come at last to the most perfect products of Greek civ-
ilization we find ourselves tragically limited in the quantity of the
remains. The devastation caused in Greek literature by time and bigotry
and mental fashions is negligible compared with the destruction of Greek
art. One classic bronze survives — the Charioteer of Delphi; one classic
marble statue — the Hermes of Praxiteles; not one temple — not even the
Theseum — has come down to us in the form and color that it had for
ancient Greece. Greek work in textiles, in wood, in ivory, silver, or
gold, is nearly all gone; the material was too perishable or too
precious to escape vandalism and time. We must reconstruct the ship from
a few planks of the wreckage.</p>
<p>The sources of Greek art were the impulses to representation and
deco- ration, the anthropomorphic quality of Greek religion, and the
athletic character and ideal. The early Greek, like other primitives,
when he out- grew the custom of sacrificing living beings to accompany
and serve the dead, buried carved or painted figures as substitutes.
Later he placed images of his ancestors in his home; or he dedicated in
the temple likenesses of himself, or of those whom he loved, as votive
figurines that might magically win for their models the protection of
the god. Minoan religion, Myce- naean religion, even the chthonic cults
of Greece, were too vague and im- personal, sometimes too horrible and
grotesque, to lend themselves to esthetic form; but the frank humanity
of the Olympian gods, and their need of temple homes for their earthly
stays, opened a wide road for sculp- ture, architecture, and a hundred
ancillary arts. No other religion — pos- sibly excepting Catholicism —
has so stimulated and influenced literature and</p>
<p>2i8</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xart: almost every book or play, statue or building or vase, that has
come down to us from ancient Greece touches upon religion in subject,
purpose, or inspiration.</p>
<p>But inspiration alone would not have made Greek art great. There was
needed a technical excellence rising out of cultural contacts and the
trans- mission and development of crafts; indeed art to the Greek was a
form of handicraft, and the artist grew so naturally out of the artisan
that Greece never quite distinguished them. There was needed a knowledge
of the human body, as in its healthy development the norm of proportion,
sym- metry, and beauty; there was needed a sensuous, passionate love of
beauty, that would hold no toil too great that might give to the living
moment of loveliness a lasting form. The women of Sparta placed in their
sleeping chambers figures of Apollo, Narcissus, Hyacinthus, or some
other hand- some deity, in order that they might bear beautiful
children.” Cypselus established a beauty contest among women far back in
the seventh cen- tury; and according to Athenaeus this periodical
competition continued down to the Christian era.“ In some places, says
Theophrastus, “there are contests between the women in respect of
modesty and good manage- ment . . . ; and also there are contests about
beauty, as for instance … in Tenedos and Lesbos.””</p>
<p>1, Vases</p>
<p>There was a pretty legend in Greece that the first cup was molded
upon Helen’s breast.® If so, the mold was lost in the Dorian invasion,
for what pot - tery has come down to us from early Greece does not
remind us of Helen. The invasion must have profoundly disturbed the
arts, impoverishing crafts- men, scattering schools, and ending for a
time the transmission of technology; for Greek vases after the invasion
begin again with primitive simplicity and crudity, as if Crete had never
lifted pottery into an art.</p>
<p>Probably the rough mood of the Dorian conquerors, using what survived
of Minoan-Mycenaean techniques, produced that Geometric style which
domi- nates the oldest Greek pottery after the Homeric age. Flowers,
scenery, and plants, so luxuriant in Cretan ornament, were swept away,
and the stem spirit that made the glory of the Doric temple contrived
the passing ruin of Greek pottery. The gigantic jars that characterize
this period made small pretense to beauty; they were designed to store
wine or oil or grain rather than to interest a ceramic connoisseur. The
decoration was almost all by repeated triangles, circles, chains,
checkers, lozenges, swastikas, or simple parallel horizontal lines; even
the human figures that intervened were geometrical — torsos were
triangles, thighs and legs were cones. This lazy style of ornament
spread through Greece,</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 219</p>
<p>and determined the form of the Dipylon vases* at Athens; but on these
enor- mous containers (usually made to receive the human dead) black
silhouettes of mourners, chariots, and animals were drawn, however
awkwardly, between the pattern’s lines. To wards the end of the eighth
century more life entered into the painting of Greek pottery; two colors
were used for the ground, curves re- placed straight lines, palmettes
and lotuses, prancing horses and hunted lions took form upon the clay,
and the ornate Oriental succeeded the bare Geometric style.</p>
<p>An age of busy experimentation followed. Miletus flooded the market
with its red vases, Samos with its alabasters, Lesbos with its black
wares, Rhodes with its whites, Clazomenae with its grays, and Naucratis
exported faience and translucent glass. Erythrae was famous for the
thinness of its vases, Chalcis for brilliance of finish, Sicyon and
Corinth for their delicate “Proto - Corinthian” scent bottles and
elaborately painted jugs like the Chigi vase in Rome. A kind of ceramic
war engaged the potters of the rival cities; one or another of them
found purchasers in every port of the Mediterranean, and in the interior
of Russia, Italy, and Gaul. In the seventh century Corinth seemed to be
winning; its wares were in every land and hand, its potters had found
new techniques of incision and coloring, and had shown a fresh
inventiveness in forms. But about 550 the masters of the Ceramicus — the
potters’ quarter on the outskirts of Ath - ens — came to the front,
threw off Oriental influence, and captured with their Black-Figure ware
the markets of the Black Sea, Cyprus, Egypt, Etruria, and Spain. From
that time onward the best ceramic craftsmen migrated to Athens or were
bom there; a great school and tradition formed as through many gen-
erations son succeeded father in the art; and the making of fine pottery
became one of the great industries, finally one of the conceded
monopolies, of Attica.</p>
<p>The vases themselves, now and then, bear pictures of the po tter’s
shop, the master working with his apprentices, or watchfully supervising
the various processes: mixing the pigments and the clay, molding the
form, painting the ground, engraving the picture, firing the cup, and
feeling the happiness of those who see beauty taking form under their
hands. More than a hundred of these Attic potters are known to us; but
time has broken up their masterpieces, and they are only names. Here on
a drinking cup are the proud words, Nikosthenes me “Nicosthenes made
me.” ®*® A greater than he was Execias, whose</p>
<p>majestic amphora is in the Vatican; he was one of many artists
encouraged by patronage and peace under the Peisistratids. From the
hands of Clitias and Ergo- timus came, about 560, the famous Fran9ois
vase, found in Etruria by a French- man of that name, and now treasured
in the Archeological Museum at Florence — a great mixing bowl covered
with row upon row of figures and scenes from Greek mythology.** These
men were the outstanding masters of the Black-</p>

<p>220 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XFigure style in sixth-century Attica. We need not exaggerate the
excellence of their work; it cannot compare, either in conception or in
execution, with the best work of the T’ang or Sung Chinese. But the
Greek had a different aim from the Oriental: he sought not color but
line, not ornament but form. The figures on the Greek vases are
conventional, stylized, improbably magnificent in the shoulders and thin
in the legs; and as this continued through the classic age, we must
assume that the Greek potter never dreamed of realistic accuracy. He was
writing poetry, not prose, speaking to the imagination rather than the
eye. He limited himself in materials and pigments: he took the fine red
clay of the Ceramicus, quieted its color with yellow, carefully engraved
the figures, and filled out the silhouettes with brilliant black glaze.
He transformed the earth into a profusion of vessels that wedded beauty
and use: hydria, amphora, oenochoe, kylix, krater, lekythos — i.e.,
water jug, two-handled jar, wine bowl, drinking cup, mixing bowl, and
unguent flask. He conceived the experiments, created the subjects, and
developed the techniques that were taken up by bronzeworkers, sculptors,
and painters; he made the first essays in foreshort- ening, perspective,
chiaroscuro, and modeling;® he paved the way for statuary by molding
terra-cotta figures in a thousand themes and forms. He freed his own art
from Dorian geometry and Oriental excess, and made the human figure the
source and center of its life.</p>
<p>Towards the last quarter of the sixth century the Athenian potter
tired of black figures on a red ground, inverted the formula, and
created that Red- Figure style which ruled the markets of the
Mediterranean for two hundred years. The figures were still stiff and
angular, the body in profile with the eyes in full view; but even within
these limits there was a new freedom, a wider scope, of conception and
execution. He sketched the figures upon the clay with a light point,
drew them in greater detail with a pen, filled in the background with
black, and added minor touches with colored glaze. Here, too, some of
the masters made lasting names. One amphora is signed, “Painted by
Euthym - ides, son of PoUias, as never Euphronius”®— which was to
challenge Euphro- nius to equal it. Nevertheless this Euphronius is
still rated as the greatest potter of his age; to him, some think,
belongs the great krater on which Heracles wrestles with Antaeus. To his
contemporary Sosias is attributed one of the most famous of Greek vases,
whereon Achilles binds the wounded arm of Patroclus; every detail is
lovingly carried out, and the silent pain of the young warrior has
survived the centuries. To these men, and now nameless others, we owe
such masterpieces as the cup in whose interior we see Dawn mourn- ing
over her dead son, and the hydria, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art at
New York, that shows a Greek soldier, perhaps Achilles, plunging his
lance into a fair and not breastless Amazon. It was before such a vase
as one of these that John Keats stood enthralled one day, until its
“wild ecstasy” and “mad pursuit” fired his brain with an o de greater
than any Grecian um.</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE</p>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Sculpture</li>
</ol>
<p>The Greek settlement of western Asia, and the opening of Egypt to
Greek trade towards 660 b.c., allowed Near Eastern and Egyptian forms
and methods of statuary to enter Ionia and European Greece. About 580
two Cretan sculp- tors, Dipoenus and Scyllis, accepted commissions at
Sicyon and Argos, and left behind them there not only statues but
pupils; from this period dates a vigorous school of sculpture in the
Peloponnese. The art had many purposes: it commemorated the dead first
with simple pillars, then with herms whose head alone was carved, then
with forms completely chiseled in the round, or with funeral-stelae
reliefs; it made statues of victorious athletes, first as types, later
as individuals; and it was encouraged by the lively imagination of Greek
faith to make countless images of the gods.</p>
<p>Until the sixth century its material was most frequently wood. We
hear a great deal of the chest of Cypselus, dictator of Corinth.
According to Pau- sanias, it was made of cedar, inlaid with ivory and
gold, and adorned with com- plicated carvings. As wealth increased,
wooden statues might be covered, in whole or part, by precious
materials; indeed it was thus that Pheidias made his chryselephantine
(i.e., gold and ivory) statues of Athene Parthenos and the Olympian
Zeus. Bronze rivaled stone as sculptural material to the end of
classical art. Few ancient bronzes have survived the temptation to melt
them down, but we may judge from the perhaps too ministerial Charioteer
of the Delphi Museum (ca. 490) how near to perfection the art of hollow
casting had been carried since Rhoecus and Theodorus of Samos had
introduced it into Greece. The most famous group in Athenian statuary,
the Tyrannicides (Harmodius and Aristogeiton), was cast in bronze by
Antenor at Athens shortly after the expulsion of Hippias. Many forms of
soft stone were used before the sculptors of Greece undertook to mold
harder varieties with hammer and chisel; but once they had learned the
art they almost denuded Naxos and Paros of marble. In the archaic period
(i 100-490) the figures were often painted; but towards the end of that
age it was found that a better effect could be secured, in representing
the delicate skin of women, by leaving the polished marble without
artificial tint.</p>
<p>The Greeks of Ionia were the first to discover the uses of drapery as
a sculp- tural element. Egypt and the Near East had left the clothing
rigid — a vast stone apron nullifying the living form; but in
sixth-century Greece the sculp- tors introduced folds into the drapery,
and used the garment to reveal that ultimate source and norm of beauty,
the healthy human body. Nevertheless the Egypto-Asiatic influence
remained so strong that in most archaic Greek sculpture the figure is
heavy, graceless, and stiff; the legs are strained even, in repose; the
arms hang helpless at the sides; the eyes have the almond form, and</p>
<p>222 THE LIFE OF GREECE ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xoccasionally an Oriental slant; the face is stereotyped, immobile,
passionless. Greek statuary, in this period, accepted the Egyptian rule
of frontality — i.e., the figure was made to be seen only from the
front, and so rigidly bisymmetri- cal that a vertical line would pass
through the nose, mouth, navel, and genitals with never a right or left
deviation, and no flexure of either motion or rest. Perhaps convention
was responsible for this dull rigidity: the law of the Greek games
forbade a victor to set up a portrait statue of himself unless he had
won all contests in the pentathlon; only then, the Greeks argued, would
he achieve the harmonious physical development that would merit
individual modeling.®^ For this reason, and perhaps because, as in
Egypt, religious convention before the fifth century governed the
representation of the gods, the Greek sculptor confined himself to a few
poses and types, and devoted himself to their mastery.</p>
<p>Two types above all won his study: the youth, or kouros^ nearly nude,
slightly advancing the left leg, with arms at the side or partly
extended, fists closed, countenance quiet and stem; and the kore^ or
maiden, carefully coiffured, mod- estly posed and draped, one hand
gathering up the robe, the other offering some gift to the gods. History
till lately called the kouroi “Apollos,” but they were more probably
athletes or funerary monuments. The most famous of the type is the
Apollo of Tenea; the largest, the Apollo of Sunium; the most
pretentious, the Throne of Apollo at Amyclae, near Sparta. One of the
finest is the small Strangford Apollo in the British Museum; finer still
is the Choiseul - Gouffier Apollo, a Roman copy of an early
fifth-century original.^ To at least the male eye the korai are more
pleasing: their bodies are gracefully slender, their faces are softened
with a Mona Lisa smile, their drapery begins to escape the stiffness of
convention; some of them, like those in the Athens Museum would be
called masterpieces in any other land;®® one of them, which we may call
the Kore of Chios,* is a masterpiece even in Greece. In them the
sensuous Ionian touch breaks through the Egyptian immobility and Dorian
austerity of the “Apollos.” Archermus of Chios created another type, or
follow ed lost models, in the Nike^ or Victory y of Delos; out of this
would come the lovely Nike of Paeonius at Olympia, the Winged Victory of
Samothrace, and, in Christian art, the winged figures of cherubim.®*
Near Miletus unknown sculp- tors carved a series of draped and seated
females for the temple of the Branchi- dae, figures powerful but crude,
dignified but ponderous, profound but dead.t</p>
<p>Sculpture in relief was so old that a pretty legend could undertake
to de- scribe its origin. A lass of Corinth drew upon a wall the outline
of the shadow that the lamplight cast of her lover’s head. Her father
Butades, a potter, filled in the outline with clay, pressed the form to
hardness, took it down, and baked</p>

<p>it; so, Pliny assures us, bas-relief was bom.® The art became even
more im- portant than sculpture in the adornment of temples and graves.
Already in 520 Aristocles made a funeral relief of Aristion, which is
one of the many treasures of the Athens Museum.</p>
<p>Since reliefs were nearly always painted, sculpture, relief, and
painting were allied arts, usually handmaids to architecture; and most
artists were skilled in all four forms. Temple moldings, friezes,
metopes, and pediment backgrounds were usually painted, while the main
structure was ordinarily left in the natural color of the stone. Of
painting as a separate art we have only negligible remains from Greece;
but we know through passages in the poets that panel painting, with
colors mixed in melted wax, was already practiced in the days of Anacre-
on.® Painting was the last great art to develop in Greece, and the last
to die.</p>
<p>All in all, the sixth century failed to rise, in any Greek art except
architecture, to the boldness of conception or the perfection of form
attained in the same age by Greek philosophy and poetry. Perhaps
artistic patronage was slow to develop in an aristocracy still rural and
poor, or in a business class too young to have graduated from wealth to
taste. Nevertheless the age of the dictators was a period of stimulation
and improvement in every Greek art — above all, under Peisistratus and
Hippias in Athens. Towards the end of this period the old rigidity of
sculpture began to thaw, the rule of frontality was broken down; legs
began to move, arms to leave the side, hands to open up, faces to take
on feeling and character, bodies to bend in a variety of poses revealing
new studies in anatomy and action. This revolution in sculpture, this
animation of stone with life, became a major event in Greek history; the
escape from fron- tality was one of the signal accomplishments of
Greece. Egyptian and Oriental influences were set aside, and Greek art
became Greek,</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Architecture</li>
</ol>
<p>The science of building recovered slowly from the Dorian invasion,
and redeemed beyond its deserts the Dorian name. Across the Dark Age
from Agamemnon to Terpander, the Mycenaean megaron transmitted the
essentials of its structure to Greece; the rectangular shape of the
building, the use of columns within and without, the circular shaft and
simple square capital, the triglyphs and metopes of the entablature,
were all preserved in the greatest achievement of Greek art, the Doric
style. But whereas Mycenaean architecture was apparently secular,
devoted to palaces and homes, classical Greek archi- tecture was almost
entirely religious. The royal megaron was transformed into a civic
temple as monarchy waned and religion and democracy united the affec-
tions of Greece in honoring the personified city in its god.</p>
<p>224 THELIFEOF GREECE ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>XThe earliest Greek temples were of wood or brick, as befitted the
poverty of the Dark Age. When stone became the orthodox material of
temple build- ing the architectural features remained as set by timber
construction; the rectangular naos or tem ple proper, the circular
shafts, the “master - beam” archi - traves, the beam-end triglyphs, the
gabled roof, confessed the wooden origin of their form; even the first
Ionic spiral was apparently a floral figure painted upon a block of
wood.®® The use of stone increased as Greek wealth and travel grew; the
transition was most rapid after the opening of Egypt to Greek trade
about 660 B.c. Limestone was the favored material of the new styles
before the sixth century; marble came in towards 580, at first for
decorative portions, then for fagades, finally for the entire temple
from base to tiles.</p>
<p>Three “orders” of architecture were developed in Greece: the Doric,
the Ionic, and, in the fourth century, the Corinthian. Since the
interior of the temple was reserved for the god and his ministrants, and
worship was held outside, all three orders devoted themselves to making
the exterior impressively beautiful. They began at the ground, usually
in some elevated place, with the stereobate — two or three layers of
foundation stone in receding steps. From the uppermost layer, or
stylobate, rose directly, without individual base, the Doric column —
“fluted” with shallow, sharp -edged grooves, and widening perceptibly at
the middle in what the Greeks called entasis, or stretching.
Furthermore, the Doric column tapered slightly towards the top, thereby
emulating the tree, and successfully contradicting the Minoan-Mycenaean
style. (An undiminished shaft — worse yet, one that tapers downward —
seems top-heavy and graceless to the eye, while the wider base heightens
that sense of stability which all archi - tecture should convey.
Perhaps, however, the Doric column is too heavy, too thick in proportion
to its height, too stolidly engrossed in sturdiness and strength. ) Upon
the Doric column sat its simple and powerful capital: a “neck - ing” or
circular band, a cushionlike echinus, and, topmost, a square abacus to
spread the supporting thrust of the pillar beneath the architrave.</p>
<p>While the Dorians were developing this style from the megaron,
modified probably by acquaintance with the Egyptian “proto - Doric”
colonnades of Der - el-Bahri and Beni-Hasan, the Ionian Greeks were
altering the same fundamental form under Asiatic influence. In the
resultant Ionic order a slender column rose upon an individual base, and
began at the bottom, as it ended at the top, with a narrow fillet or
band; its height was usually greater, and its diameter smaller, than in
the Doric shaft; the upward tapering was scarcely perceptible; the
flutings were deep, semicircular grooves separated by flat edges. The
Ionic capital was composed of a narrow echinus, a still narrower abacus,
and between them — almost concealing them — emerged the twin spirals of
a volute, like an infolded scroll — a graceful element adapted from
Hittite, Assyrian, and other Oriental forms.®* These characteristics,
together with the elaborate adornment</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 22 ^</p>
<p>of the entablature, described not only a style but a people; they
represented in stone the Ionian expressiveness, suppleness, sentiment,
elegance, and love of delicate detail, even as the Doric order conveyed
the proud reserve, the massive strength, the severe simplicity of the
Dorian; the sculpture, literature, music, manners, and dress of the
rival groups differed in harmony with their archi- tectural styles.
Dorian architecture is mathematics, Ionian architecture is poetry, both
seeking the durability of stone; the one is “Nordic,” the other
Oriental; together they constitute the masculine and feminine themes in
a basically har- monious form.</p>
<p>Greek architecture distinguished itself by developing the column into
an ele- ment of beauty as well as a structural support. The essential
function of the external colonnade was to uphold the eaves, and to
relieve the walls of the naos, or inner temple, from the outward thrust
of the gabled roof. Above the columns rose the entablature — i.e., the
superstructure of the edifice. Here again, as in the supporting
elements, Greek architecture sought a clear differentiation, and yet an
articulated connection, of the members. The architrave — the great stone
that connected the capitals — was in the Doric order plain, or carried a
simple painted molding; in Ionic it was composed of three layers, each
project- ing below, and was topped with a marble cornice segmented with
a confusing variety of ornamental details. Since the sloping beams that
made the frame- work of the roof in the Doric style came down, and were
secured, between two horizontal beams at the eaves, the united ends of
the three beams formed — at first in wood, then imitatively in stone — a
triglyph or triply divided surface. Between each triglyph and the next a
space was left as an open window when the roof was of wood or of
terra-cotta tiles; when translucent marble tiles were used these
metopes, or “seeing - between” places, were filled in with mar - ble
slabs carved in low relief. In the Ionic style a band or frieze of
reliefs might run around the upper outer walls of the naos or cella; in
the fifth century both forms of relief — metopes and frieze — were often
used in the same building, as in the Parthenon. In the pediments — the
triangles formed by the gabled roof in front and rear — the sculptor
found his greatest opportunity; the figures here might be drawn out in
high relief and enlarged for view from below; and the cramped corners,
or tympana, tested the subtlest skill. Finally, the roof itself might be
a work of art, with brilliantly colored tiles and decorative rain-dis-
posing acroteria, or pinnacle figures, rising from the angles of the
pediments. All in all, there was probably a surplus of sculpture on the
Greek temple, be- tween the columns, along the walls, or within the
edifice. The painter also was involved: the temple was colored in whole
or in part, along with its statues, moldings, and reliefs. Perhaps we do
the Greeks too much honor today, when time has worn the paint from their
temples and divinities, and ferrous strains have lent to the marble
natural and incalculable hues that set off the brilliance</p>

<p>(chap. EC</p>
<p>of the stone under the clear Greek sky. Some day even contemporary
art may become beautiful.</p>
<p>The two rival styles achieved grandeur in the sixth century, and
perfection in the fifth. Geographically they divided Greece unevenly;
Ionic prevailed in Asia and the Aegean, Doric on the mainland and in the
west. The salient achievements of sixth-century Ionic were the temples
of Artemis at Ephesus, of Hera at Samos, and of the Branchidae near
Miletus; but only ruins survive of Ionic architecture before Marathon.
The finest extant buildings from the sixth century are the older temples
of Paestum and Sicily, all in the Doric style. The ground plan remains
of the great temple built at Delphi, between 548 and 512, from the
designs of the Corinthian Spintharus; it was destroyed by earth- quake
in 373, was rebuilt on the same plan, and in that form still stood when
Pausanias made his tour of Greece. Athenian architecture of the period
was almost wholly Doric: in this style Peisistratus began, about 530,
the gigantic temple of the Olympian Zeus, on the plain at the foot of
the Acropolis. After the Persian conquest of Ionia in 546, hundreds of
Ionian artists migrated to Attica, and introduced or developed the Ionic
style in Athens. By the end of the century Athenian architects were
using both orders, and had laid all the technical groundwork for the
Periclean age.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Music and the Dance</li>
</ol>
<p>The word mousike among the Greeks meant originally any devotion to
any Muse. Plato’s Academy was called a Museion or Museum— i.e., a place
dedicated to the Muses and the many cultural pursuits which they patron-
ized; the Museum at Alexandria was a university of literary and
scientific activity, not a collection of museum pieces. In the narrower
and modem sense music was at least as popular among the Greeks as it is
among our- selves today. In Arcadia all freemen studied music to the age
of thirty; everyone knew some instrument; and to be unable to sing was
accounted a disgrace.® Lyric poetry was so named because, in Greece, it
was com- posed to be sung to the accompaniment of the lyre, the harp, or
the flute. The poet usually wrote the music as well as the words, and
sang his own songs; to be a lyric poet in ancient Greece was far more
difficult than to compose, as poets do today, verses for silent and
solitary reading. Before the sixth century there was hardly any Greek
literature divorced from music. Education and letters, as well as
religion and war, were bound up with music: martial airs played an
important part in military training, and nearly all instruction of the
memory was through verse. By the eighth</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 227</p>
<p>century Greek music was already old, with hundreds of varieties and
forms.</p>
<p>The instruments were simple, and were based, like our vaster armory
of sound, upon percussion, wind, or strings. The first class were not
popu- lar. The flute was favored at Athens until Alcibiades, laughing at
his music master’s inflated cheeks, refused to play so ridiculous an
instrument, and set a fashion against it among Athenian youth. (Besides,
said the Athenians, the Boeotians surpassed them with the flute, which
branded the art as a vulgar one.“) The simple flute, or aulos, was a
tube of cane or bored wood with a detachable mouthpiece and from two to
seven finger holes into which movable stopples might be inserted to
modify the pitch. Some play- ers used the double flute — a “masculine”
or bass flute in the right hand and a “feminine” or treble flute in the
left, both held to the mouth by a strap around the cheeks, and played in
simple harmony. By attaching the flute to a distensible bag the Greeks
made a bagpipe; by uniting several gradu- ated flutes they made a
syrinx, or Pipe of Pan; by extending and opening the end, and closing
the finger holes, they made a salpinx, or trumpet.“ Flute music, says
Pausanias,“ was usually gloomy, and was always used in dirges or
elegies; but the auletridcd — the flute-playing geisha girls of Greece —
do not seem to have purveyed gloom. String music was confined to
plucking the strings with finger or plectrum; bowing was unknown.“ The
lyre, phorminx, or kithara were essentially alike — four or more strings
of sheep gut stretched over a bridge across a resonant body of metal or
tor- toise shell. The kithara was a small harp, used for accompanying
narrative poetry; the lyre was like a guitar, and was chosen to
accompany lyric poetry and songs.</p>
<p>The Greeks told many strange tales of how the gods — Hermes, Apollo,
Athena — had invented these instruments; how Apollo had pitted his lyre
against the pipes and flutes of Marsyas (a priest of the Phrygian
goddess Cybele), had won — unfairly, as Marsyas thought — by adding his
voice to the instrument, and had topped the performance by having poor
Marsyas flayed alive: so legend personified the conquest of the flute by
the lyre. Prettier stories were told of ancient musicians who had
established or devel- oped the musical art: of Olympus, Marsyas’ pupil,
who, towards 730, in - vented the enharmonic scale;* of Linus, Heracles’
teacher, who invented Greek musical notation and established some of the
“modes”;™ o f Orpheus, Thracian priest of Dionysus; and of his pupil
Musaeus, who said that “song • A scale employing quarter tones; e.g., E
E’ F A B B’ C E— where the accent indicates a quarter tone above the
preceding note.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xis a sweet thing to mortals.”” These tales reflect the probable fact
that Greek music derived its forms from Lydia, Phrygia, and
Thrace.*”</p>
<p>Song entered into almost every phase of Greek life. There were
dithyrambs for Dionysus, paeans for Apollo, hymns for any god; there
were enkomia^ or songs of praise, for rich men, and epmikiUy or songs of
victory, for athletes; there were symposiaka^ skolia^ erotikUy
hymenaioi^ elegiai^ and threnot for din- ing, drinking, loving,
marrying, mourning, and burying; herdsmen had their hukolikuy reapers
their lityerseSy vinedressers their epilentUy spinners their iouloty
weavers their elinoir And then as now, presumably, the man in the market
or the club, the lady in the home and the woman of the streets, sang
songs not quite as learned as Simonides’; vulgar music and polite music
have come down dis - tantly together through the centuries.</p>
<p>The highest form of music, in the belief and practice of the Greeks,
was choral singing; to this they gave the philosophical depth, the
structural com- plexity, the emotional range, which in modern music tend
to find place in the concerto or the symphony. Any festival — a harvest,
a victory, a marriage, a holy- day — might be celebrated with a chorus;
and now and then cities and groups would organize great contests in
choral song. The performance was in most cases prepared far in advance:
a composer was appointed to write the words and music, a rich man was
persuaded to pay the expense, professional singers</p>
<p>• The mu sic of Hellas was played in a variety of scales far more
numerous and complex than ours. Our diatonic scale makes no smaller
division than the half tone, and twelve half tones constitute our
octave; the Greeks used quarter tones, and had forty-five scales of
eigh- teen notes apiece.’® These scales were in three groups: the
diatonic scales, based upon the tetrachord EDGE; the chromatic, upon E C
B; and the enharmonic, upon E C Cb B. From the Greek scales, by
simplification, came those of medieval church music, and, through these,
our own.</p>
<p>Within the diatonic tetrachord seven modes (harmoniai) were produced
by tuning the strings to alter the position of the semitones in the
octave. The most important modes were the Dorian (E F G A B C D E),
martial and grave though in a minor key; the Lydian (C D E F G A B C) ,
tender and plaintive though in a major key; and the Phrygian (D E F G A
B C D) , minor in key, and orgiastically passionate and wild.’* It is
amusing to read of the violent controversies concerning the musical,
ethical, and medical effects, restorative or disastrous, which the
Greeks — chiefly the philosophers — ascribed to these half-tone
variations. Dorian music, we are told, made men brave and dignified, the
Lydian made them sentimental and weak, the Phrygian made them excited
and headstrong. Plato saw effeminate luxury and gross immorality as the
offspring of most music, and wished to banish all instrumental per-
formances from his ideal state. Aristotle would have had all youths
trained in the Dorian mode.’® Theophrastus had a good word to say even
for the Phrygian mode; serious diseases, he tells us, can be made
painless by playing a Phrygian air near the affected part.’®</p>
<p>Greek musical notation used not ovals and stems on a staff of lines,
but the letters of the alphabet, varied by inversion or transversion,
augmented by dots and dashes to make sixty- four signs, and placed above
the words of the song. A few scraps of such notation have come down to
console us for the loss of the rest; they indicate melodies akin rather
to Oriental than to European strains, and would be more bearable to the
Hindus, the Chinese, or the Japanese than to our dull Occidental ears,
untrained to quarter tones.</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 229</p>
<p>were engaged, and the chorus was carefully trained. All the singers
sang the same note, as in the music of the Greek Church today; there was
no “part song” except that in later centuries the accompaniment was
played a fifth above or below the voice, or ran counter to it; this is
as near as the Greeks seem to have come to harmony and
counterpoint.”</p>
<p>The dance in its highest development was woven into one art with
choral singing, just as many forms and terms of modem music were once
associated with the dance;’* and dancing rivaled music in age and
popularity among the Greeks. Lucian, imable to trace its earthly
beginnings, sought the origins of the dance in the regular motions of
the stars.®® Homer tells us not only of the dancing floor made by
Daedalus for Ariadne, but of an expert dancer among the Greek warriors
at Troy, Meriones, who, dancing while he fought, could never be found by
any lance.“ Plato described orchesiSy or dancing, as “the instinctive
desire to explain words by ges tures of the entire body”— which is
rather a description of certain modem languages; Aristotle better
defined the dance as “an imitation of actions, characters, and passions
by means of postures and rhythmical movements.”®® Socrates himself
danced, and praised the art as giving health to every part of the
body;®® he meant, of course, Greek dancing.</p>
<p>For the Greek dance was quite different from ours. Though in some of
its forms it may have served as a sexual stimulant, it rarely brought
men into physical contact with women. It was an artistic exercise rather
than a walking embrace, and, like the Oriental dance, it used arms and
hands as much as legs and feet.®* Its forms were as varied as the types
of poetry and song; ancient authorities listed two hundred.®® There were
religious dances, as among the Dionysiac devotees; there were athletic
dances, like Sparta’s Gymnopedia, or Festival of Naked Youth; there were
martial dances, like the Pyrrhic, taught to children as part of military
drill; there was the stately hyporchemUy a choral hymn or play performed
by two choirs of which one alternately sang or danced while the other
danced or sang; there were folk dances for every major event of life and
every season or festival of the year. And as for everything else, there
were dance contests, usually involving choral song.</p>
<p>All these arts — lyric poetry, song, instramental music, and the
dance — were closely allied in early Greece, and formed in many ways one
art. As time went on, and already in the seventh century, specialization
and professionalism set in. The rhapsodes abandoned song for recitation,
and separated narrative verse from music.®® Archilochus sang his lyrics
without accompaniment,®^ and began that long degeneration which at last
reduced</p>
<p>• The word foof, as meaning part of a verse, owes its origin to the
dance that accompanied</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xpoetry to a fallen angel silent and confined. The choral dance broke
up into singing without dancing, and dancing without singing; for, as
Lucian put it, “The violent exercise caused shortness of breath, and the
song suf - fered for it.”“ In hke manner there appeared musi cians who
played</p>
<p>without singing, and won the applause of devotees by their precise
and rapid execution of quarter tones.” Some famous musicians, then as
now, engrossed the receipts; Amoebeus, harpist and singer, received a
talent (000) each time tha t he performed.” The common player,
doubtless, lived from hand to mouth, for the musician, like other
artists, belongs to a profession that has had the honor of starving in
every generation.</p>
<p>The highest repute went to those who, like Terpander, Arion, Aleman,
or Stesichorus, were skilled in all forms, and wove choral song,
instrumental music, and the dance into a complex and harmonious whole
probably more profoundly beautiful and satisfying than the operas and
orchestras of today. The most famous of these masters was Arion. About
him the Greeks told the tale how, on a voyage from Taras to Corinth, the
sailors stole his money, and then gave him a choice between being
stabbed to death or drowned. Having sung a final song, he dived into the
sea, and was carried on the back of a dolphin (perhaps his harp) to the
shore. It was he who, chiefly at Corinth and towards the close of the
seventh century, transformed the inebriated singers of impromptu
Dionysiac dithyrambs into a sober</p>
<p>and trained “cycle” chorus of fifty voices, singing in strophe and
antis- trophe, with arias and recitatives as in our oratorios. The theme
was usu- ally the suffering and death of Dionysus; and in honor of the
god’s tradi - tional attendants the chorus was dressed in goatlike satyr
guise. Out of this, in fact and name, came the tragic theater of the
Greeks.</p>
<p>5 . The Beginnings of the Drama</p>
<p>The sixth century, already distinguished in so many fields and lands,
crowned its accomplishments by laying the foundations of the drama. It
was one of the creative moments in history; never before, so far as we
know, had men passed from pantomime or ritual to the spoken and secular
play.</p>
<p>Comedy, says Aristotle,” developed “out of those who led the phallic
procession.” A compan y of people carrying sacred phalh, and singing
dithyrambs to Dionysus, or hymns to some other vegetation god, consti-
tuted, in Greek terminology, a komos, or revel. Sex was essential, for
the culmination of the ritual was a symbolic marriage aimed at the magic
stim- ulation of the soil;” hence in early Greek comedy, as in most
modem com -</p>
<p>CHAP.IX) THE COMMON CULTURE OF EARLY GREECE 23I</p>
<p>edies and novels, marriage and presumptive procreation form the
proper ending of the tale. The comic drama of Greece remained till
Menander obscene because its origin was frankly phallic; it was in its
beginnings a joyous celebration of reproductive powers, and sexual
restraints were in some measure removed. It was a day’s moratorium on
morals; free speech {parr hasia) was then particularly free;” and many
of the paraders, dressed in Dionysian satyr style, wore a goat’s tail
and a large artificial phallus of red leather as part of their costume.
This garb became traditional on the comic stage; h tvas a matter of
sacred custom, religiously observed in Aristophanes; indeed, the phallus
continued to be the inseparable emblem of the clown iint:.! the fifth
century of our era in the West, and the last century of th . Byzantine
Empire in the East.” Along with the p hallus, in the Old Comedy, went
the licentious kordax dance.”</p>
<p>Strange to say, it was in Sicily that the rustic vegetation revel was
first transformed into the comic drama. About 560 one Susarion of Megara
Hyblaea, near Syracuse, developed the processional mirth into brief
plays of rough satire and comedy.” From Sicily the new art passed into
the Peloponnesus and then into Attica; comedies were performed in the
vil- lages by traveling players or local amateurs. A century passed
before the authorities — to quote Aristotle’s phrase“— treated the comic
drama seriously enough to give it (465 B.c.) a chorus for representation
at an official fes- tival.</p>
<p>Tragedy — tragoidia, or the goat song — arose in like manner from the
mimic representations, in dancing and singing, of satyrlike Dionysian
rev- elers dressed in the costume of goats.” These satyr plays remained
till Euripides an essential part of the Dionysian drama; each composer
of a tragic trilogy was expected to make a concession to ancient custom
by offering, as the fourth part of his presentation, a satyr play in
honor of Dionysus. “Being a development of the satyr play,” says
Aristotle,” “it was quite late before tragedy rose from short plots and
comic diction to its full dignity.” Doubtless other seeds matured in the
birth of tragedy; perhaps it took something from the ritual worship and
appeasement of the dead.’“ But essentially its source lay in mimetic
religious ceremonies like the representation, in Crete, of the birth of
Zeus, or, in Argos and Samos, his symbolic marriage with Hera, or, in
Eleusis and elsewhere, the sacred mysteries of Demeter and Persephone,
or, above all, in the Peloponnesus and Attica, the mourning and
rejoicing over the death and resurrection of Dionysus. Such
representations were called dromena — things performed; drama is a
kindred word, and means, as it should, an action. At Sicyon tragic
choruses, till the days of the dictator Cleisthenes, commemorated.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>(chap, k</p>
<p>we are to ld, the “sufferings of Adrastus,” the ancient king. At
Icaria, where Thespis grew up,, a goat was sacrificed to Dionysus;
perhaps the “goat song” from which tragedy derived its name was a chant
sung over the dismembered symbol or embodiment of the drunk en god.“ The
Greek drama, like ours, grew out of religious ritual.</p>
<p>Hence the Athenian drama, tragic and comic, was performed as part of
the festival of Dionysus, under the presidency of his priests, in a
theater named after him, by players called “the Dionysian artists.” The
statue of Dionysus was brought to the theater and so placed before the
stage that he might enjoy the spectacle. The performance was preceded by
the sac- rifice of an animal to the god. The theater was endowed with
the sanctity of a temple, and offenses committed there were punished
severely as sac- rileges rather than as merely crimes. Just as tragedy
held the place of honor on the stage at the City Dionysia, so comedy
held the foreground at the festival of the Lenaea; but this festival too
was Dionysian. Perhaps originally the theme, as in the drama of the
Mass, was the passion and death of the god; gradually the poets were
allowed to substitute the suffer- ings and death of a hero in Greek
myth. It may even be that in its early forms the drama was a magic
ritual, designed to avert the tragedies it por- trayed, and to purge the
audience of evils, in a more than Aristotelian sense, by representing
these as borne and finished with by proxy.”* In part it was this
religious basis that kept Greek tragedy on a higher plane than that of
the Elizabethan stage.</p>
<p>The chorus as developed for mimetic action by Arion and others became
the foundation of dramatic structure, and remained an essential part of
Greek tragedy until the later plays of Euripides. The earlier dramatists
were called dancers because they made their plays chiefly a matter of
choral dancing, and were actually teachers of dancing.”* Only one thing
was needed to turn these choral representations into dramas, and that
was the opposition of an actor, in dialogue and action, to the chorus.
This inspira- tion came to one of these dancing instructors and chorus
trainers, Thespis of Icaria — a town close to the Peloponnesian Megara,
where the rites of Dionysus were popular, and not far from Eleusis,
where the ritual drama of Demeter, Persephone, and Dionysus Zagreus was
annually performed. Helped no doubt by the egoism that propels the
world, Thespis separated himself from the chorus, gave himself
individual recitative lines, developed the notion of opposition and
conflict, and offered the drama in its stricter sense to history. He
played various roles with such verisimilitude that when his troupe
performed at Athens, Solon was shocked at what seemed to him a kind of
public deceit, and denounced this newfangled art as immoral”*— a</p>

<p>charge that it has heard in every century. Peisistratus was more
imagina- tive, and encouraged the competitive performance of dramas at
the Diony- sian festival. In 534 Thespis won the victory in such a
contest. The new form developed so rapidly that Choerilus, only a
generation later, produced 160 plays. When, fifty years after Thespis,
Aeschylus and Athens returned victorious from the battle of Salamis, the
stage was set for the great age in the history of the Greek drama.</p>

<p>Looking back upon the multifarious civilization whose peaks have been
sketched in the foregoing pages, we begin to understand what the Greeks
were fighting for at Marathon. We picture the Aegean as a beehive of
busy, quarrelsome, alert, inventive Greeks, establishing themselves
obstinately in every port, developing their economy from tillage to
industry and trade, and already creating great literature, philosophy,
and art. It is amazing how quickly and widely this new culture matured,
laying in the sixth cen- tury all the foundations for the achievements
of the fifth. It was a civiliza- tion in certain respects finer than
that of the Periclean period — superior in epic and lyric poetry,
enlivened and adorned by the greater freedom and mental activity of
women, and in some ways better governed than in the later and more
democratic age. But even of democracy the bases had been prepared; by
the end of the century the dictatorships had taught Greece enough order
to make possible Greek liberty.</p>
<p>The realization of self-government was something new in the world;
life without kings had not yet been dared by any great society. Out of
this proud sense of independence, individual and collective, came a
power- ful stimulus to every enterprise of the Greeks; it was their
liberty that inspired them to incredible accomplishments in arts and
letters, in science and philosophy It is true that a large part of the
people, then as always, harbored and loved superstitions, mysteries, and
myths; men must be con- soled. Despite this, Greek life had become
unprecedentedly secular; poli- tics, law, literature, and speculation
had one by one been separated and liberated from ecclesiastical power.
Philosophy had begun to build a nat- uralistic interpretation of the
world and man, of body and soul. Science, almost unknown before, had
made its first bold formulations; the elements of Euclid were
established; clarity and order and honesty of thought had become the
ideal of a saving minority of men. A heroic effort of flesh and spirit
rescued these achievements, and the promise they held, from the dead
hand of alien despotism and the darkness of the Mysteries, and won for
European civilization the trying privilege of freedom.</p>
