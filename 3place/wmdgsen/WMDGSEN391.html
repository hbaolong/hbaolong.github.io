France</h4>
<p>1559-74</p>
<p>I. THE RIVAL FORCES</p>
<p>AS long as he fears or remembers insecurity, man is a competitive</p>
<p>jt^ animal. Groups, classes, nations, and races similarly insecure
compete as covetously as their constituent individuals, and more
violently, as know- ing less law and having less protection; Nature
calls all living things to the fray. In the broil of Europe between the
Reformation (1517) and the Peace of Westphalia (1648), this collective
competition used religion as a cloak and a weapon for economic or
political ends. When, after a century of struggle, the combatants laid
down their arms, Christianity barely sur- vived among the ruins.</p>
<p>France suffered first and recovere d first; her “religious wars” of
1562 to 1594 were to her what the Thirty Years’ War (1618 -48) was to be
to Germany, and the Civil Wars (1642-48) to England. When Henry II</p>
<p>died in a tragic joust (1559) and his fifteen-year-old son succeeded
him as Francis II, the nation had been led to bankruptcy by the long
contest be- tween the Hapsburgs and the Valois kings. The gross annual
revenue of the government was then 12,000,000 livres; the public debt
was 43,000,000. Many magistrates had been unpaid for four years past.
The French people could not be persuaded to pay taxes.^ A financial
crash threw Lyon into economic chaos in 1559. The flow of American
silver and gold through Spain and Portugal into France depreciated the
currency, inflated prices, and set on foot an angry race between wages
and prices, in which no one gained but the informed and speculative
financiers. In 1567 and 1577 the government tried by edict to fix maxima
for prices and wages, but the eco- nomic scramble overrode the laws,*
and inflation went on, perhaps as an impious way to pay for pious wars.
The only prosperous organization in the country was the Catholic Church,
with its 94,000 ecclesiastics (in</p>
<p>1600), its 80,000 nuns, its 70,000 monks or friars, its 2,500
Jesuits, its august cathedrals and stately episcopal sees, its extensive
and well-cultivated lands. A third — ^some said two thirds — of the
riches of France belonged to the Church.® Behind the religious wars lay
the desire to retain or obtain this ecclesiastical wealth.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Church, Charles de Guise, who had been made</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>Cardinal of Lorraine at thirty-five, was now chief minister to
Francis II. The ducal family of the Guises took its name from their
castle near Laon, but had its main seat in Lorraine, which had only
recently been absorbed into France. The Cardinal was handsome, of alert
intelligence and decent life, a good administrator, eloquent in Latin,
French, and Italian; but his taste for wealth and power, his suave
duplicity, his readiness to persecute dissent and avenge opposition, his
courageous retrenchment of govern- mental outlays, made him enemies in
almost every class. His older brother, Francis, Duke of Guise, had
already earned renown in strategy and battle and was now minister of
war; but as the national bankruptcy counseled peace, Francis had to
nurse his ambitions in a galling idleness. He loved glory, fine raiment,
and cavalier display, but his courtly manners and grace of person and
carriage made him the idol of Catholic France. He was in- tolerant of
heresy and proposed to exterminate it by force.^ He and his brother were
convinced that if France, like Germany and England, adopted
Protestantism, the Church would be near its end, and France would lose
the religious ardor that had supported its social order and its national
unity. In defense of their faith and their power the Guises braved many
perils, suffered premature death, and shared responsibility for the
harrowing of France.</p>
<p>The Huguenots were no longer a small and helpless minority of French
Protestants led and inspired by Calvin from Geneva, but a spreading doc-
trinal and social revolt against the Church. Calvin reckoned them to be
lo per cent of the French people in 1559;® Michelet estimated their num-
bers to have doubled by 1572.® They had centers in every province from
Dauphine to Brittany, above all in southwest France, where, three
centuries back, the Albigensian heresy had met with apparent
extermination. Despite the repressive legislation of Francis I and Henry
II, they held their prayer meetings, fed on solemn sermons preaching
predestination, issued a fire of pamphlets on the abuses of the Church
and the tyranny of the Guises, and held a general synod in Paris (May
26, 1559) under the very nose of the King. They professed loyalty to the
French monarchy, but they organized on republican lines the regions
where they prevailed. Like any persecuted minority, they formulated a
temporary ideology of liberty, but they agreed with the Catholics that
the state should enforce the “true religion” through - out France. Their
ethical theory was stricter than the time-relaxed code of their enemies;
they avoided dancing, faricy dress, and the theater; and they denounced
with indignation the morals of the court, where, as Jeanne d’Albret told
her son, “it is not the men who invite the women, but the women who
invite the men.”^</p>
<p>The Queen Mother, Catherine de Medicis, thought that in both parties
“religion is a cover which serves merely to mask ill will… and yet
they</p>
<p>CHAP, xm)</p>
<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>have nothing less than religion in their hearts.”® She may have put
it too strongly, but unquestionably social and economic factors underlay
the religious strife. The peasantry remained Catholic; it had no
material stake in the contest, and saw no substitute in a stern
predestinarian Protestantism for the comforting myths and festival
alleviations provided by the ancient faith. The proletariat, small
numerically but big with revolt, denounced its employers, and gave a
sympathetic hearing to “the Reform” as promising some change; and as in
the England of the Lollards and the Puritans and the Germany of the
Peasants’ War, the Gospel became a textbook of revo - lution.® The
middle classes too gave ear to the courageous preachers that Geneva
trained and sent to France. The businessmen, who at the great fairs met
prosperous Germans, Englishmen, and Swiss, noted the successful alliance
of these merchants with Protestant rulers and ideas. They had long
suffered contumely under bishops and barons disdainful of commerce and
tied to feudal ways; they learned with pleasure and envy that Calvin was
well disposed toward business and finance, and that he gave a share to
the laity in the control of morals and the church. They resented
ecclesiastical wealth and tithes, and feudal tolls on trade. They could
not forgive the monarchy for subjecting to the central government the
municipal com- munes that had for centuries been their political
preserve.^® Even bankers smiled on the Huguenots, who raised no eyebrows
at the taking of interest, upon which the Church had immemorially
frowned, though lately winking a solemn theological eye.</p>
<p>Many nobles were taking up the rebel cause. They too were
unreconciled to the centralization of power in a unified state. They
must have heard of territorial German princes who, in league with
Protestantism, had been able to defy emperors and popes, and had
enriched themselves with the spoils of the Church. What if these doughty
Huguenots could serve as a timely tool for chastening and subordinating
the king? The nobles con- trolled the fields, the crops, and the
peasantry of France, they organized and led her regiments, they held her
fortresses, they governed her provinces. If the Reform won the
aristocracy it would have a nation-wide power at its back. Already in
1553 the Cardinal of Lorraine had warned Henry II that the nobility were
defecting to the Huguenots. In Normandy, Brittany, Poitou, Anjou, Maine,
Saintonge, by 1559, nobles were openly leading the Huguenot revolt.</p>
<p>Proud Bourbon families had not forgiven the ruling Valois dynasty for
driving Charles, Duke of Bourbon, to treason and an early death (1527);
nor did they relish their exclusion from the French government by the
clannish Guises, whom they looked upon as foreigners from a Lorraine
that was far more German than French. Louis I de Bourbon, Prince of
Conde, descended from King Louis IX, was of royal blood, far superior
in</p>
<p>336 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>rank to the Guises; he joined the Huguenots, and died in the attempt
to rise to power on the wave of their faith. His brother, Antoine de
Bourbon, titular King of Navarre — ^but actually ruling only the
province of Bearn, in southwest France — ^played on the Huguenot side
for a while, largely under the influence of his wife, Jeanne d’Albret.
Jeanne was the ag gressive daughter of the gentle Marguerite of Navarre,
who had remained out- wardly orthodox in deference to her brother,
Francis I, but had protected many a heretic and Huguenot. As the mother
had represented the Renais- sance in love of life and poetry, so Jeanne
exemplified the role and the character of women in the French
Reformation — fervent in their religion to the point of intolerance,
rearing and dedicating their children to carry on the holy war to death
or victory. She brought up her famous son, the future Henri Quatre, to
every Spartan and Puritan virtue, and did not live to see him revert to
the lax gaiety of the Renaissance. She must have ad- mired intensely
Gaspard de Coligny, for he was all that she idealized: a nobleman in
title and character, a prudent but loyal leader of the Huguenot cause, a
stern soldier-statesman whose blameless morals shamed the gilded
infidelities of the court.</p>
<p>Calvin had cautioned his Huguenot followers against violent
resistance to the government,^^ but their patience withered in the heat
of persecution. Henry II had ordered all judges to issue the death
penalty against per- sistent Protestants (June 1559). Francis II, urged
on by the Guises, re- newed this edict, and added that all buildings in
which Reformed assemblies met should be demolished; that all persons,
even relatives, who sheltered a condemned heretic, or failed to report
him to the magistrates, should also suffer death. In the last five
months of 1559 eighteen persons were burned alive for unrepentant
heresy, or for refusing to attend Mass or receive Catholic Communion.
Hundreds of French Huguenots fled to Geneva, where Calvin succored them.
Those who remained in France began to organize themselves for civil
war.</p>
<p>On December 23, 1559, Anne du Bourg, who had dared in the Parlement
of Paris to condemn persecution for heresy, was burned at the stake.
Soon thereafter Gaspard de Heu was strangled in the Chateau de Vincennes
by order of the Guises. His brother-in-law, Godefroi de Barri, Seigneur
de La Renaudie, conspired with nobles and others to capture and depose
the Guises in a coup de main to be effected at Amboise. The Cardinal of
Lor- raine discovered the plot, mobilized troops, overcame and arrested
the con- spirators, hanged some, beheaded some, flung others into the
Loire in sacks. “For a whole month,” said a contemporary chronicle,
“there was nothing but hanging or drowning folks. The Loire was covered
with corpses”</p>
<p>(March 1560).^^ Conde was summoned to the royal court to answer
charges of complicity; he came, denied them, and challenged any
accuser</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>o trial by combat. No evidence was adduced against him, and he was
left free.</p>
<p>Disturbed by this “Tumult of Amboise,” the high rank of the conspira
- tors, the ferocity of the suppression, and the fever of revenge that
agitated Huguenots and nobles, Catherine persuaded the weakling King and
the reluctant Guises to allow a trial of toleration. She called Michel
de</p>
<p>L’Hopital to the post of chancellor (May 1560) and bade him
pacify</p>
<p>France. As a student in Italy Michel had learned to be a humanist
rather than a dogmatist; as a magistrate in France he had treated
Catholics and Protestants with equal mercy and consideration. Now he
proposed to the Parlement the views which had led Du Bourg to the stake:
“Every man hath made a religion for himself. Some… desire that their
religion should be accepted, and the faith of the rest hunted down…. We
must try to deal gently with one another, to invent a modus vivendi.’’^^
Following his lead, Catherine summoned an Assembly of Notables,
consisting of both Catholics and Protestants, which met at Fontainebleau
on August 21, 1560. Coligny there presented to the King a petition from
the Huguenots, affirm- ing their loyalty but asking for full freedom of
worship. Some bishops called for moderation on both sides and urged the
clergy to reform their morals. The Assembly decided that the problems
involved required a con- vocation of delegates from all sections and
classes of France. The King ordered such a States-General to meet on
December 10, and meanwhile forbade any trials for heresy till the new
gathering could pass upon the basic issues that were dividing the
country.</p>
<p>The Huguenot Bourbons, fearing arrest, had refused to attend the As-
sembly of Notables. Skeptical of conciliation, the Prince of Conde and
Antoine de Bourbon plotted to raise an army and set up an independent
state with Lyon as its capital. One of Conde’s couriers was intercepted
by the government; papers found on him revealed the conspiracy; Conde
was arrested, tried, and condemned to be executed on December 10. The
Guises resumed dictatorial power.</p>
<p>Suddenly the situation was changed by the death of Francis II
(De-</p>
<p>cember 5), aged sixteen. His brother, Charles IX, succeeded to his
formal power, but, being only ten years old, he accepted the regency of
his mother, who now joined Elizabeth of England and Philip II of Spain
in guiding the chaos of Europe to their rival ends.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CATHERINE DE MEDICIS</li>
</ol>
<p>She is still a puzzle, after four centuries of conflicting
interpretations. Descended from Lorenzo the Magnificent, grandniece of
Pope Leo X, she</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XHI</p>
<p>was a typical Medici, with government in her heritage and subtlety in
her blood. Born in Florence (1519) of parents who both died of syphilis
be- fore she was a month old, she remained a helpless and movable pawn
in the diplomacy of her embattled relatives until licr uncle. Pope
Clement VII, gave her, aged fourteen, in marriage to the future Henry II
of France. For ten years she remained barren while her somber mate
devoted himself to Diane de Poitiers. Then children emerged from her
almost annually, ten in all. She hoped and schemed to get them thrones.
Three of them died in childhood; three became kings of France; two
became queens. Nearly all of them tasted tragedy, but herself most of
all, who lived through the deaths of her husband and three successive
royal sons. Queen or Queen Mother, she bore the vicissitudes of four
reigns, and survived them by prudence, self-control, and unscrupulous
duplicity.</p>
<p>A contemporary described her as “a beautiful woman when her face is
veiled”^^ — that is, she had a fine figure; and Brantome assures us that
her bosom was “white and full,” her “thigh very beautiful,” and her
hands and fingers exquisite.^® But her features were rugged, her eyes
too big, her lips too thick, her mouth too large. If she seduced men it
was by proxy. Rumor accused her of keeping about her an escadron volant,
or flying squadron, of pretty women who might bring men around to her
purposes;^® but this was apparently a fiction. Wounded by Diane’s
dominance in policy as in love, she found revenge, after Henry’s death,
by making her - self for thirty years the power behind the throne. Her
finesse had to atone for the incompetence of her sons; they resented her
interference, but their failure as kings compelled it. Cast into the
maelstrom of a religious revolu- tion, surrounded by aggressive nobles
and intolerant dogmatisms, she fought with the only weapons she had —
Medicean money, Italian acumen. Machiavellian diplomacy. Machiavelli had
dedicated The Prince to her father; Catherine hardly needed its
instruction, for she had seen its prin- ciples practiced everywhere in
Italy and France. Like Elizabeth of Eng- land, she outplayed all the
statesmen around her, beat them at lying, “had more wiles than all the
Council of the King.”^® She worked hard and ably at administration.
“Nothing is done without her knowing it,” said an</p>
<p>Italian obs erver; “scarcely has she time to eat”^® — though somehow
she achieved obesity. Her personal morals were above her time. She seems
to have been faithful to her unfaithful husband and to his memory; after
his death she wore mourning to the end of her life. Her greatest
successor, Henry IV, judged her leniently:</p>
<p>I ask you, what could a woman do, left by the death of her hus-</p>
<p>band with five little children on her arms, and two families in
France who were thinking of grasping the crown — ours [the Bourbons] and

<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>he Guises? Was she not compelled to play strange parts to deceive
first one and then the other, in order to guard, as she did, her
sons,</p>
<p>who successively reigned through the wise conduct of that shrewd</p>
<p>woman? I am surprised that she never did worse.^®</p>
<p>We may accept this as a fair appraisal of Catherine’s behavior
before</p>
<ol start="1570" type="1">
<li>Surrounded by these rival families and forces, she played them off
against each other. “God willing,” she wrote, “I shall not let myself be
governed either by one party or the other, having learned only too well
that they all love God, the King, and myself less than their profit… and
the satisfaction of their ambition.”*’ She was too much of a Renaissance
Italian to savor the predestinarian severity of the Huguenots; besides,
she was asking the Church for a loan to stave off state bankruptcy;**
neverthe- less she was ready, for France’s sake, to marry her da ughter
Marguerite to the Huguenot Henry of Navarre, and her son Henry to the
excommuni- cated Elizabeth. She saw the situation in dynastic and
political rather than in religious or economic terms. She had to protect
her divided country against the Hapsburg union of Spain and -Austria.
The Treaty of Cateau- Cambresis had left the Spanish power supreme in
Flanders and encroach- ing dangerously upon northeastern France. At any
moment the old war of Valois and Hapsburg might flame again, and then
France would need Huguenot as well as Catholic blood and arms. External
danger demanded internal peace.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this frame of mind she and her Chancellor L’Hopital prepared
to</p>
<p>meet the States- General at Orleans. The “states” were not regions
but classes: the nobility, the clergy, and, as the tiers etat, the
remainder of France — principally the bourgeoisie or middle classes of
the towns or boroughs (bourgs), but also, in some modest representation,
the peasantry and the incipient proletariat. Chosen by local and class
powers rather than by any wide suffrage, the delegates had in theory no
legislative authority, but only the right to advise the monarch;
however, his need for funds gave the advice some force.</p>
<p>L’Hopital opened the session (Dec ember 13, 1560) with an idealistic
appeal for mutual toleration. It was the function of government, he
urged, to maintain peace, order, and justice among all citizens
impartially, with- out regard to their religious opinions. It was
desirable that all Frenchmen should have the same religion, for this
would favor national unity and strength; but if such a general agreement
could not be peacefully reached, toleration became advisable. Who, after
all, he asked, knows what is heresy and what is truth? “Y ou say your
religion is the better; I say mine is; is it any more reasonable that I
should adopt your opinion than that you should adopt mine?… Let us end
these diabolical names, these partisan</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>(chap, xih</p>
<p>ags and factions and seditions — ^Lutherans, Huguenots, Catholics;
let us change our name to Christians!”*®</p>
<p>The response was not cordial. A doctor of the Sorbonne — then the
faculty of theology in the University of Paris — demanded the death
penalty for all heretics, and the papal nuncio advised Catherine to
begin by burn- ing all the Huguenot delegates, then all the Huguenots in
Orl^ans.<em>^ The Huguenot delegates proposed to the Queen Mother a
variety of reforms: that all pastors should be chosen by their
congregations; that bishops should be chosen by the pastors and the
nobles of the diocese; that a third of ecclesiastical revenues should go
to relief of the poor, and another third to the building of churches,
hospitals, and schools; and that the doctrine of the Church should be
limited to Scripture.</em>® This was a bit too advanced for Catherine,
who needed Church money desperately. She appeased the Huguenots by
freeing the imprisoned Conde and urging Pius IV to allow the removal of
religious images from churches, and the administration of the Sacrament
in wine as well as bread.*® On January 28, 1561, she released all
persons arrested for religious “offenses,” and ordered an end, till
further notice, of all prosecutions for religion. On the thirty-first
she prorogued the States-General to reassemble in May and meet her needs
for funds. The Huguenots expanded in this sunshine. On March 2 they held
at</p>
<p>Poitiers their second national synod. Protestant ministers preached
freely in the apartments of Conde and Coligny at the court at
Fontainebleau. At Castres in south France a municipal election (January
i, 1561) gave all ofiices to Protestants; soon thereafter all citizens
were ordered to attend Protestant services;<em>^ Catholic services were
forbidden; religious images were officially condemned to be
destroyed.</em>® At Agen and Montauban the Huguenots took over unused
Catholic churches. The old Constable Anne de Montmorency formed with the
Duke of Guise and Marshal de Saint- Andre a “triumvirate” to protect the
Catholic interest (April 6, 1561). Riots flared up at Paris, Rouen,
Beauvais, and elsewhere. The Queen issued an “Edict of July” (1561)
forbidding violence and public Hu -</p>
<p>guenot services. The Huguenots ignored the edict; in various
towns</p>
<p>hey attacked Catholic processions, entered Catholic churches, burned
rehcs, and smashed images.<em>® At Montpellier, in the autumn of 1561,
all the sixty churches and convents were sacked, and many priests were
killed; at Montauban the Convent of the Poor Claires was burned down,
and the nuns were dispersed with the advice to get themselves
husbands.®® At Carcassonne the Catholics slaughtered all available
Protestants.®^ At Nimes the Huguenots expelled all priests, appropriated
or destroyed all Catholic churches, burned down the cathedral, and
trampled the consecrated Host underfoot (February 1562).®</em>
Generally, in Languedoc and Guienne, the Huguenots, when they gained the
upper hand, seized Catholic churches and</p>

<p>property and expelled the Catholic clergy.®® Huguenot ministers,
though more exemplary in their personal morals than the Catholic
priests, quite equaled them in intolerance;®^ they excommunicated
Huguenots who were married by Catholic priests or who allowed their
children to marry Cath- olics.®® Neither side saw any sense in
toleration.</p>
<p>The States-General resumed its sittings on August i, 1561, this time
at Pontoise. It offered funds to the government on condition that its
consent should thereafter be prerequisite to any levy of new taxes or
any declara- tion of war. The Third Estate, now chief provider of funds,
added a bold request — that the entire property of the Catholic Church
in France should be nationalized, that the clergy should be paid by the
state, and that out of the surplus of 72,000,000 livres thus obtained
42,000,000 should go to the liquidation of the public debt. The Catholic
clergy, frightened, made a hurried peace with Catherine by offering her
16,600,000 livres, to be paid cautiously in ten annual installments. She
accepted, and the States- General was dissolved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile L’Hopital, with Catherine’s consent and over the protest of
the Pope, had invited Catholic and Protestant clergymen to meet and seek
some formula for pacification. Six cardinals, forty bishops, twelve
doctors of the Sorbonne, twelve canonists, ten Protestant ministers from
France, one from England, Theodore de Beze from Geneva, and twenty
Protestant laymen met at Poissy, eleven miles west of Paris, for the
famous “Colloquy of Poissy” (September 9, 1561). The King, the Queen
Mother, the princes of the blood, and the Council of State attended in
all their dignity. Beze, representing the aged Calvin, was received with
almost royal honors; he held a Reformed service and preached in
Catherine’s palace. He spoke at first moderately and charmed all with
his perfect French; but when he re- marked that in the Eucharist “the
body of Christ is as far remove d from the consecrated bread as heaven
is from earth,” the Catholic delegates cried out in protest, and turmoil
ensued. The bishops urged the banishment of all preachers who questioned
the Real Presence,®® and the colloquy broke up with the conflict of
dogmas embittered and unappeased.</p>
<p>It was the merry wont of the Huguenots to hold their meetings in
a</p>
<p>public square confronting a Catholic church, and to disturb the Mass
with lusty psalms; the Catholics in turn drowned out the psalmody by
ringing the steeple bell. At Paris a Protestant assemblage before the
Church of St.-Medard was nullified by a mighty clangor from the
campanile; a</p>
<p>Protestant who entered the church to protest was killed; in fury the
Protes- tants sacked the building and smashed the statues and the
crucifix. In the resultant battle eighty worshipers were wounded
(December 27, 1561).</p>
<p>Catherine thought to mollify the Catholics by her “Edict of
January”</p>
<p>(1562), which required the Huguenots to surrender all ecclesiastical
build-</p>
<p>342</p>

<p>(chap. XITI</p>
<p>ings to their former owners and to hold their assemblies only outside
the town walls. The Catholic leaders agreed with Bezc that this was in
effect an edict of toleration, which recognized Protestantism as a legal
religion in France; Parlement leaders told Catherine to her face that
they would die rather than register the edict. When Montmorency and
Saint-Andre con- demned her policy, Catherine dismissed them from the
court; and when Cardinal de Tournon fulminated against her she retired
him to his diocese. Catholic preachers denounced her as a Jezebel — the
same term that Protes- tant Knox was then applying to the Catholic Queen
of Scots.</p>
<p>On Sunday, March i, 1562, Francis, Duke of Guise, passing with a band
of two hundred armed retainers through the village of Vassy, some forty
miles northwest of Dijon, stopped in a church there to hear Mass. The
psalm singing of Huguenots meeting in a nearby barn disturbed the
service. He sent a messenger to ask them to defer their songs for
fifteen minutes, till the Mass should be finished. They found this too
inconvenient. While Guise continued his worship some of his retainers
exchanged sectarian com- pliments with the Huguenots; the retainers drew
their swords, the Hugue- nots threw stones; one stone struck Guise as he
left the church, and drew ducal blood; his followers dashed into the
assemblage of five hundred men, women and children, killed twenty-
three, and wounded a hundred.“’*’ The “Massacre of Vassy” roused the
Protestants of France to martial fever; the Catholics, especially in
Paris, hailed it as a timely chastening of a trouble- some minority.
Catherine ordered Guise to come to her at Fontainebleau; he refused and
went on to Paris; Montmorency and Saint-Andre joined him on the way with
two thousand men. Conde ordered his Protestant levies to assemble in
arms at Meaux. The Catholic triumvirate marched in force to
Fontainebleau, captured the Queen Another and the royal family, and
compelled them to stay at Melun, twenty-seven miles from Paris; they
formed a new Privy Council, chiefly of Guise’s men and excluding</p>
<p>L’Hopital. Conde led his 1,600 warriors t o Orleans and called upon
all Reformed congregations to send him troops. The first of the
“Religious Wars” began (April 1562).</p>
<p>in. ARBITRAMENT OF BLOOD: 1562-7O</p>
<p>Both sides sought and received foreign aid, the Catholics from Spain,
the Protestants from England and Germany. Elizabeth, bribed by the
promise of Calais, sent 6,000 men; 2,000 of these took Rouen, but Guise
captured and sacked the city (October 26, 1562), and his spoils-hungry
soldiers pillaged and slaughtered Catholic and Protestant inhabitants
im- partially. In these actions Antoine de Bourbon, who had joined the
Catholic</p>
<p>CHAP, xni)</p>
<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>343</p>
<p>faith and forces, was mortally wounded. The Huguenots took control of
most towns in south France, sacking churches and smashing images re-
ligiously. Their main body of 17,000 men, under Conde and Coligny,
marched toward Normandy to unite with the English reinforcements. At
Dreux they were intercepted by a Catholic army of 17,000 under the
triumvirs; on December 19 a furious battle was fought, which left 6,000
dead on the field; Saint-Andre was killed, Montmorency was wounded and
captured by the Huguenots, Conde was wounded and captured by the
Catholics. For a time French courtesy prevailed: Montmorency was treated
as a hero, who, though commander in chief of the King’s armies, had al -
ways fought in the ranks and had been wounded in seven battles; and the
Duke of Guise used Conde as an honored guest, dined with him, and shared
with him the only bed available in the camp.®® The indecisive victory
went to the Catholics, but Paris and the royal family for a time
believed that the Huguenots had won. Catherine took the news calmly,
saying, “Very well, then, we shall p ray to God in French.”®®</p>
<p>Guise himself met death in the aftermath of victory. While deploying
his army to besiege Orleans he was shot in ambush by Jean Poltrot de
Mere (February 18, 1563), a nineteen-year-old Huguenot. The Duke died
after six days of pain. Poltrot, brought before Catherine, asserted that
Coligny had hired him, for a large sum, to murder Guise, and that Beze
had promised him Paradise if he succeeded. Catherine wrote to Coligny
asking for his answer to the charge. He denied any part in the
assassination plan; he had often warned the Duke to beware of assassins;
he admitted that he had heard Poltrot declare his intention, and had
done nothing to deter him; he had given Poltrot one hundred crowns, but
for other purposes; however, he was not sorry that the plot had
succeeded, “for… fortune can deal no better stroke for the good of the
Kingdom and the Church of God, and most especially it is good for myself
and my house.”^® Poltrot was tom apart</p>
<p>Catherine continued to work for peace; it was quite clear that either
faction, if decisively victorious, would set her aside and possibly
depose her son. She called L’Hopital back to her Council, arranged a
meeting of Montmorency and Conde, and persuaded them to sign the Edict
of Am- boise, ending the First Religious War (Adarch 19, 1563). The
terms were a victory for the Huguenot nobles only: liberty of conscience
and practice of the religion “called reformed” were granted “for all
barons and lords high justiciary in their houses, with their families
and dependents,” and “for nobles having fiefs without vassals and living
on the King’s lands, but for them and their families personally.” The
Huguenot worship was to be</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xm</p>
<p>allowed in towns where it had been practiced before March 8, 1563;
other- wise it was to be confined to the outskirts of a single town in
any senes- chalty or bailiwick; in Paris it was altogether forbidden.
Coligny charged Conde with having sacrificed the Huguenot rank and file
to protect his class.</p>
<p>On September 15 Charles IX, who was not yet fourteen, was declared of
age; Catherine surrendered her regency, but not her leadership. In March
1564 she led the King and the court on a progress through France, partly
to show the nation its new monarch, partly to consolidate the fragile
peace. At Roussillon she issued an edict of partial toleration, calling
upon each faith to respect the liberty of the other. After fourteen
months of royal touring, the party reached Bayonne (June 3, 1565), where
Catherine greeted with joy her daughter Elizabeth, now Queen of Spain,
and conferred with the Duke of Alva in secret parleys that alarmed the
Huguenots. They rightly suspected that Alva counseled full forcible
measures against them, but his extant letters to Philip make it clear
that Catherine rejected his proposals, refused to dismiss L’Hopital, and
still clung to her policy of peace.^*^ Soon after her return to Paris
(December 1565) she used all her influence to rec- oncile Coligny,
Montmorency, Conde, and the Guises.</p>
<p>In 1564 the Jesuits entered France; their sermons roused the ardor of
the Catholics, and in Paris especially they converted a number of Hugue-
nots. In the provinces a strong Catholic reaction nullified many
Protestant gains. The edicts of toleration were repeatedly violated, and
barbarity flourished under both dispensations. It was not unusual for
Catholic magis- trates to hang citizens merely for being Huguenots.^® At
Nimes the Protes- tants massacred eighty Catholics (1567).^^ Between
1561 and 1572 there were eighteen massacres of Protestants, five of
Catholics; and there were over thirty assassinations.^® Catherine
imported mercenaries from Switzer- land and gave no satisfactory answer
when Conde asked for what use she intended them. Believing that their
own lives were in danger, Conde and Coligny, with armed followers, tried
to seize the King and the Queen Mother at Meaux (September 1567), but
Montmorency foiled the attempt. Catherine now feared Coligny as once she
had feared Guise.</p>
<p>Coligny and Conde felt that a second war was needed to restore even
the limited rights of the Huguenots. They in their turn imported mer-
cenaries, chiefly from Germany, to reinforce their depleted armies; they
captured Orleans and La Rochelle and marched on Paris. Catherine asked
Alva for reinforcements; he sent them at once, and at St.-Denis, just
out- side the capital, Montmorency led sixteen thousand men against
Conde’s troops in one of the bloodiest and least decisive battles of
these wars. Montmorency died of his wounds. France again wondered what
religion was this that led men to such slaughter; and L’Hopital seized
the opportu -</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>345</p>
<p>nity to arrange the Peace of Longjumeau (March 23, 1568), which re-
stored the modest toleration granted in the Edict of Amboise.</p>
<p>The Catholics denounced the treaty and refused to carry out its
terms. Coligny protested to Catherine; she pleaded impotence. In May
1568 the Spanish ambassador at Rome, Juan de Zuniga, reported that he
had heard from Pope Pius V that the French government was considering
the assas- sination of Coligny and Conde.^® The two Huguenot leaders may
have had similar information. They fled to La Rochelle, where they were
joined by Jeanne d’Albre t and her son, now fifteen years old and
itching for action. A new Huguenot army was formed, a fleet was
collected, the walls were fortified, and all attempts of government
forces to enter the city were repulsed. English private vessels accepted
Conde’s commission, flew his flag, and made a prey of any Catholic
property they could seize.^^ Conde was now virtually sovereign south of
the Loire.</p>
<p>Catherine looked upon this Third Religious War as a revolution, as an
attempt to divide France into two nations, one Catholic, the other
Protes- tant. She reproached L’Hopital for the failure of his
conciliation policies; he resigned; she replaced him as chancellor with
an uncompromising partisan of the Guises. On September 28, 1568, the
government repealed the edicts of toleration and outlawed the Reformed
faith from France.</p>
<p>All that winter the rival forces prepared for a decisive engagement.
On March 3, 1569, they met at Jarnac, near Angouleme. The Huguenots were
defeated; Conde, exhausted with wounds, surrendered, but was shot from
the rear and died. Coligny took command and reorganized the troops for
an orderly retreat. At Moncontour the Huguenots were again defeated, but
Coligny recovered by strategy what had been lost in battle; and with-
out victories, almost without food, the undiscourageable Huguenots ad-
vanced to within a few hours’ march of Paris (1570). Despite subsidies
from Rome and Spain, the government found it difficult both to finance
its armies and to keep the Catholic nobles in the field for more than a
month or two at a time. Meanwhile hordes of mercenaries devastated the
country, pillaging Catholics and Protestants indiscriminately, and
killing all who dared resist.</p>
<p>Catherine offered Coligny a renewal of the Treaty of Longjumeau; he
refused it as inadequate and continued his advance. At this point the
youth- ful Charles IX suddenly asserted his authority and signed at
St.-Germain (August 8, 1570) a peace that gave the oft-defeated
Huguenots more than they had ever gained before: freedom of worship
except in Paris or near the court, full eligibility to public office,
and, as a guarantee that these terms would be honored in practice, the
right to hold four cities under their independent rule for two years.
The Catholics fumed and wondered why such a surrender followed so many
victories. Philip and the Pope protested.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XHI</p>
<p>Catherine turned them off with the assurance that she was only biding
her time.*</p>
<p>Nevertheless she proceeded to strengthen the new peace by offering to
marry her daughter Marguerite of Valois to Henry, King of Navarre, now,
since Conde’s death, the titular head of the Huguenots. It was
Catherine’s</p>

<p>But would Henry’s mother consent? Jeanne d’Albret was Huguenot in
body and soul. Coming to the court in 1561, she declared that “she would
not go to Mass if they killed her; she would sooner throw her son and
her kingdom into the sea than yield” on the contrary, she had her
Huguenot chaplain preach to her with all doors open, and defiantly
ignored the re- criminations of the Parisian populace. When her husband
was converted to Catholicism she left him and the court (1562), returned
to Bearn, and rais ed money and troops for Conde. After her husband’s
death she made Protestantism compulsory in Bearn (which included the
cities of Pau, Nerac, Tarbes, Orthez, and Lourdes); Catholic clergymen
were dis-</p>
<p>possessed and were replaced by Huguenot ministers;^® for fifty years
there- after no Mass was heard in Bearn.®® Pope Pius IV excommunicated
her and wished to depose her, but Catherine dissuaded him.®^ When Jeanne
ac- cepted the offer to bind Valois and Bourbon in marriage she may have
remembered this, a nd Catherine’s long struggle for peace. Besides, Cath
- erine’s sons were sickly; might they not all die and leave the throne
of France to Henry of Navarre? Had not the soothsayer Nostradamus
prophe- sied that the Valois dynasty would soon end?</p>
<p>The sickliest of the sons, Charles IX, might have been a lovable
youth except for occasional fits of cruelty and temper that blazed out
at times into a passion verging on insanity. Between such storms he was
a reed in the wind, seldom having a mind of his own. Perhaps he weakened
himself by sensual indulgence. He was married to Elizabeth, daughter of
the Emperor</p>

<p>Maximilian II; but his illicit and lasting love was for his Huguenot
mistress, Marie Touchet. He was sensitive to art, poetry, and music; he
loved to recite Ronsard’s lyrics, and he wrote in Ronsard’s honor verses

<p>Je puis donner la mort, toi rimmortalite.*</p>
<p>When Coligny joined the court atBlois (September 1571), Charles took
to him as weakness welcomes strength. Here was a man all the world away
from so many who had been pirouetting around the throne: a gentleman, an
aristocrat, but quiet and sober, carrying half of France in the power of
his word. The young King called the aging commander “wow pke,” ap -
pointed him commander of the fleet, gave him from the royal purse a
grant of 100,000 livres to reimburse him for his losses during the wars.
Coligny joined the Council and presided over it in the absence of the
King.®* Charles had always been jealous and fearful of Philip II; he
resented the dependence of Catholic France upon Spain. Coligny proposed
to him that a war with Spain would give France a unifying cause, and
would rec- tify that northeastern boundary upon which Spain was
encroaching. Now was the time, for William of Orange was leading a
revolt of the Nether- lands against their Spanish overlord; one good
push, and Flanders would be French. Charles listened sympathetically. On
April 27 he wrote to Count Louis of Nassau, who was leading the
Protestant rebellion in</p>
<p>Hainaut, that “he was determined… to employ the powers which God had
put into his hands for the deliverance of the Low Countries from the
oppression under which they were groaning.”®* Louis and his brother Wil
- liam of Orange offered to surrender Flanders and Artois to France in
re- turn for decisive aid against Spain.®^ In the fall of that year
Charles</p>
<p>negotiated with the Elector Augustus of Saxony for a defensive
alliance of France and Protestant Germany.®®</p>
<p>Catherine condemned Coligny’s proposals as fantastically
impracticable. Now that she had the peace that France so needed, it
would be folly to unleash the hounds of war so soon again. Spain was as
bankrupt as France,</p>
<ul>
<li>We both wear diadems; but I my crown</li>

<p>(chap. XIH</p>
<p>but she was still the strongest power in Christendom; she had just
covered herself with glory in the defeat of the Turks at Lepanto; she
would have all Catholic Europe — and most of Catholic France — to
support her if France entered a Protestant league. In such a war Coligny
would be com- mander in chief, and, through his influence on the
impressionable Charles, he would in effect be king; Catherine would be
relegated to Chenonceau, if not to Italy. Henry of Guise and Henry of
Anjou — ^brother of the King — learned with dismay that Charles was
allowing Coligny to send Hugue- not troops to join Louis of Nassau;
Alva, forewarned by his friends at the French court, overwhelmed this
force (July lo, 1572). A full meeting of the King’s Council heard
Coligny defend his proposals for war with Spain (August 6-9, 1572); they
were unanimously rejected; Cohgny persisted. “I have promised on my own
account,” he said, “my assistance to the Prince of Orange; I hope the
King will not take it ill if, by means of my friends, and perhaps in
person, I fulfill my promise.” He said to the Queen Mother, “Madame, the
King is toda y shunning a war which would promise him great advantages;
God forbid that there should break out another which he cannot shun.”®®
The Council broke up in excited resentment of what seemed a threat of
another civil war. “Let the Queen beware,” warned M arshal de Tavannes,
“of the King her son’s secret counsels, designs, and sayings; if she do
not look out the Huguenots will have him.”®’’ Catherine took Charles
aside and reproached him for having surrendered his mind to Coligny; if
he persisted in the plan for war against Spain she would ask his leave
to withdraw with her other son to Florence. He asked her forgive- ness
and promised filial obedience, but he remained Coligny’s devoted
friend.</p>
<p>It was in this atmosphere that Jeanne d’Albret came to B lois to
prepare for the marriage that was to unite Catholic and Protestant
France. She in- sisted that Cardinal de Bourbon should perform the
ceremony not as a priest but as a prince, not in a church but outside
it, and that Henry should not accompany his wife into the church to hear
Mass. Catherine agreed, though this would raise more trouble with the
Pope, who had refused dis- pensation for Marguerite to marry the
Protestant son of an excommuni- cated Protestant. Then Jeanne went on to
Paris to shop, fell sick of pleurisy, and died (June 9, 1572). The
Huguenots suspected that she had been poisoned, but this hypothesis is
no longer entertained.®® Despite his own suspicions and grief, Henry of
Navarre came from Blois to Paris in August, accompanied by Coligny and
eight hundred Huguenots. Four thousand armed Huguenots followed them
into the capital,®® partly to see the festi- vities, partly to protect
their young King. Catholic Paris, aroused by this influx and a hundred
inflammatory sermons,®® denounced the marriage as a surrender of the
government to Protestant force. Nevertheless the cere-</p>

<p>mony took place (August i 8 ), without papal dispensation; Catherine
took measures to prevent the post from bringing a papal prohibition.
Henry led his wife to the portals of Notre Dame, but did not enter with
her; Paris was not yet worth a Mass. Provisionally he lodged with
Marguerite in the Louvre.</p>
<p>Seldom had Paris seethed with such excitement. Coligny, still
pressing for open aid by France to the revolting Netherlands, was
believed ready to leave for the front. Some Catholics warned Catherine
that Huguenots were planning another attempt to kidnap her and the
King.®^ The hammering of anvils throughout the city revealed the hurried
forging of weapons. At this juncture, according to her son Henry,
Catherine gave her consent to the murder of the Admiral.®*</p>
<p>On August 2 2, as Coligny was walking from the Louvre to his house,
two shots from a window cut off the first finger of his left hand and
ripped his arm to the elbow. His companions rushed into the building,
but found only a smoking arquebus; the assailant had escaped by the
rear. Coligny wa s carried to his rooms. The King, informed, cried out
angrily, “Am I never to have any peace?” He sent his personal physician,
the Huguenot Ambroise Pare, to treat the wounds, assigned royal guards
to Coligny’s house, commanded the Catholics to leave the adjoining
premises, and al- lowed Huguenots to move in.®® The Queen, the King, and
his brother Henry came to comfort the wounded man, and Charles swore the
“most terrible oath” to revenge the attack. Coligny again urged Charles
to enter</p>
<p>Henry of Navarre came to Coligny and discussed measures of defense.
Some members of the Admiral’s retinue wished to go at once and
assassinate the Guise leaders; he forbade them. “If ample justice be not
done,” said the Huguenots, “they would certainly do it themselves.”®®
All that day Hugue - nots moved about the Louvre; one of them told the
Queen that if justice were not soon executed they would take the law
into their own hands.®^ Bands of armed Huguenots passed repeatedly by
the Hotel de Lorraine, where the Guises were staying, and shouted
threats of death.®® The Guises appealed to the King for protection and
barricaded themselves in their house. Charles, suspecting them of having
hired the assassin, arrested sev- eral of their servants and menaced the
Duke of Guise. Henry and his brother the Duke of Aumale asked permission
to leave Paris; it was granted;</p>
<p>350 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XIIl</p>
<p>hey went as far as the Porte St.-Antoine; then they turned back and
secretly made their way to the Hotel de Lorraine.</p>
<p>On August 23 the Council met to inquire into the crime. They learned
that the house from which the shots had been fired was owned (though not
occupied) by the Dowager Duchess of Guise, who had vowed to avenge the
murder of her husband, Francis; that the assassin had escaped on a horse
taken from the stables of the Guises; that the weapon had be- longed to
one of the Duke of Anjou’s guardsmen. The assassin was never
apprehended. According to An jou’s later account, he and Henry of Guise
now decided that Coligny and some other Huguenots must be killed. While
Catherine and some members of the Council were assembled in the Tui-
leries, Anjou’s agent Bouchavannes ruslied in with the announcement t
hat the Huguenots in Coligny’s lodgings were planning violent revolt,
prob - ably for the next evening.®® To Catherine’s dislike of the
Admiral, her anger at what seemed to her his seduction of the King from
her guidance, her conviction that the policy of war with Spain would be
disastrous for France and her dynasty, there was now added the fear that
her life was in immediate danger, and that all power might soon pass
into the hands of Coligny and his friends. She agreed that the leading
Huguenots should be killed.^®</p>
<p>But the consent of the King was desirable, if not necessary; and he
was sdll demanding the prosecution of all concerned in the attack upon
Coligny. About ten o’clock in this evening of August 23 the Quee n
Mother sent Count de Retz to warn Charles of the supposed insurrection.
Soon Cath- erine and her councilors surrounded the young ruler, whose
excitement now brought him close to insanity. Catherine assured him that
thirty thou- sand Huguenots were planning to seize him on the morrow and
carry him off to some Protestant stronghold, where he would be captive
and im- potent; had they not twice before attempted such a stroke? If
victorious, they would kill her on suspicion of having ordered or
allowed the attack upon the Admiral. The boy of twenty-three was told to
choose between his mother’s life and the lives of six Huguenots. If he
refused consent, and Catholic Paris should overcome the revolt, he would
be set aside as a coward and a fool. He resisted these arguments; he
asked why it would not suffice to arrest the Huguenot leaders and try
them legally; the councilors answered that it was too late to avert
revolt by such action. Catherine threatened to withdraw to Italy and
leave him to his fate. Finally, toward midnight, in a fit of nervous
breakdown and rage, Charles shouted, “By the death of God, since you
choose to kill the Admiral, I consent! But then you must kill all the
Huguenots in France, so that not one shall be left to reproach me…. Kill
them all! Kill them all!” Uttering blasphemies, he fled from his
councilors and shut himself up in his room.</p>

<p>If the conspirators had plotted to kill only a few, they now took
ad-</p>
<p>vantage of the King’s mad order to make the slaughter of the
Huguenots as thorough as possible. Catherine insisted on protecting
Henry of Navarre; the young Prince of Conde — ^Henry I — and the
Montmorencys were ex- cepted as too noble for slaughter; the surgeon
Arnbroise Pare was saved by the King; but word was sent out to the
district captains of Paris to arm their men and be ready for action at
the tolling of church bells at three o’clock in the morning, August 24,
St. Bartholomew’s Day. Cart e blanche was given the Guises to execute
their long-delayed revenge upon the Ad- miral. Henry of Guise sent word
to the officers of the militia that at the tocsin’s sound their men were
to slay every Huguenot they could find. The gates of the city were to be
closed to prevent escapes.</p>
<p>While it was yet night Guise himself led three hundred soldiers to
the building where Coligny lay asleep. Near him were Pare his physician.
Mer- lin his secretary, Nicolas his servant. They were awakened by the
clatter of soldiers approaching; they heard shots and cries — Coligny’s
guards were being killed. A friend burst into the room crying, “We are
lost!” The</p>
<p>Admiral replied, “I have long bee n prepared for death. Save
yourselves. I do not wish those who hold you dear to be able to reproach
me with your death. I commend my soul to the mercy of God.” They fled.
Guise’s</p>
<p>soldiers broke in the door. They found Coligny kneeling in prayer.
A</p>
<p>soldier ran him through and slashed his face; others stabbed him;
still alive, he was tossed through the window to fall upon the pavement
below at Guise’s feet. After making sure that Coligny was dead, the Duke
ordered his men to scatter through Paris and s pread the word, ‘’Tuez!
Tuez ! — Kill! Kill! The King commands it.” The head of the Admiral was
severed from his body and sent to the Louvre — some said to Rome;’‘^ the
body was given up to the multitude, which mangled it ferociously, cut
off the hands and the genitals to offer them for sale, and strung up the
rest by the heels.’’®</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Queen, feeling some remorse or fear, sent orders to the
Guises to halt the massacre; they answered that it was too late; Coligny
being dead, the Huguenots must be killed or they would surely revolt.
Catherine yielded and ordered the tocsin to be rung. There followed such
slaughter as cities have seldom known even in the frenzy of war. The
populace rejoiced at the freedom given to its suppressed impulses to
strike, to inflict pain, and to kill. It hunted out and slew from two to
five thousand Huguenots and others; murders previously meditated could
now be per- petrated with impunity; harassed or ambitious wives or
husbands took the opportunity to rid themselves of unwanted mates;
merchants were slain by competitors; relatives too slow to die were
pointed out as Huguenots by prospective heirs.’® Ramus the philosopher
was killed at the urging of a jealous professor. Every house suspected
of harboring Huguenots was in-</p>
<p>352 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP, XIII</p>
<p>vaded and searched; Huguenots and their children were dragged into
the streets and slain; embryos were torn from dead mothers and smashedJ^
Soon corpses littered the pavement; urchins played games on them. The
Catholic Swiss guards of the King entered the fray and slew indiscrimi-
nately out of pure joy of slaughter. The Duke de La Rochefoucauld, who
had played tennis with the King the day before, was killed by masked men
who, he supposed, had come to invite him to some royal frolic. Huguenot
nobles and officers who had been lodged in the Louvre as the King of
Navarre’s retinue were called into the courtyard and were shot one by
one as they came. Henry himself, rising at dawn, went off to play
tennis. Charles sent for him and Conde and gave them a choice of “the
Mass or death.” Conde chose death, but was saved by the Queen. Navarre
promised compliance and was allowed to live. His bride. Marguerite,
sleeping fret- fully, was awakened by a wounded Huguenot who rushed into
her room and her bed; she persuaded his pursuers to spare him. “As I
write,” re - ported the Spanish ambassador, “they are killing them all,
they are strip - ping them naked… sparing not even the children. Blessed
be God!”^® Now that the law itself had become lawless, pillage ran free,
and the King was informed that members of his court had joined in the
sack of the capital. Toward midday some horrified citizens pleaded with
him to have the slaughter stopped, and a party of the town police
offered to help restore order. He issued commands to halt the massacre;
he bade the police imprison Protestants for their own protection; some
of these he saved, others, at his bidding, were drowned in the Seine.
For a while the carnage abated. But on Monday the twenty-fifth a
hawthorn blossomed, quite out of season, in the Cemetery of the
Innocents; the clergy hailed this as a miracle; the church bells of
Paris rang out to acclaim it; the populace mistook the clangor as a call
to renew the slaughter; murder took on new life.</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth the King went in state with his court, through
the streets still littered with corpses, to the Palace of Justice, and
proudly certi- fied to the Parlement of Paris that he had ordered the
massacre. The presi- dent replied with a long address of congratulation.
Parlement voted that Coligny’s heirs should be outlawed, his home at
Chatillon demolished, the remainder of his property confiscated by the
Duke of Anjou. On the twenty-eighth the King, the Queen Mother, and the
court visited several churches in a religious festival of thanksgiving
for the redemption of France from heresy and the escape of the royal
family from death.</p>
<p>The provinces imitated Paris in their amateur way. Inspired by news
from the capital, Lyon, Dijon, Orleans, Blois, Tours, Troyes, Meaux,</p>
<p>Bourges, Angers, Rouen, Toulouse staged ecstatic massacres (August
24-26). Jacques de Thou reckoned 800 victims at Lyon, 1,000 at
Orleans.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>The King encouraged and then discouraged these holocausts. On the
twenty-sixth he sent verbal instructions to provincial governors to kill
all leading Huguenots;^® on the twenty-seventh he sent them written
orders to protect peaceful and law-abiding Protestants. At the same time
he wrote his agent at Brussels to invite the Duke of Alva’s co
-operation:</p>
<p>The Duke has many of my rebellious subjects in his hands, and the</p>
<p>means of taking Mons and punishing those [besieged] in it. If he</p>
<p>answers you that this is tacitly to require him to kill these
prisoners</p>
<p>and to cut to pieces those in Mons, you are to say that this is what
he must do.’^^</p>
<p>Alva rejected the invitation. When he captured Mons he allowed the
French garrison to depart unharmed. Privately he scorned the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew as a base means of waging war; publicly he ordered a
celebration of the massacre as a triumph for the only true
Christianity.’^® Some provincial governors kept their populace under
civilized control. There were no killings in Champagne, Picardy, or
Brittany, and few in Auvergne, Languedoc, Burgundy, or Dauphine. At Lyon
many Catholics denounced the slaughter, and the soldiers refused to take
part in it; at Vienne the bishop took the Protestants under his
protection, and Catholic families gave hiding to endangered
Huguenots.’^® But at Troyes and Orleans the bishops gave full rein to
the massacre;®® at Bordeaux a Jesuit announced that the Archangel
Michael had ordered the killings, and he condemned the tardiness of the
magistrates in ordering the executions. Probably the provinces
contributed 5,000 victims and Paris some 2,000; but estimates of the
total range from 5,000®^ to 30,000.®®</p>
<p>Catholics generally condoned the massacre as an explosion of
resentment and revenge after years of Huguenot persecution of
Catholics.®® Philip II laughed beyond his dour wont when he heard the
news; now there would be no danger of France’s interfering in the
Netherlands. The papal nuncio at Paris wrote to Rome: “I congratulate
His Holiness from the depths of my heart that it has pleased the Divine
Majesty, at the beginning of his pontificate, to direct the affairs of
this kingdom so felicitously and so honor- ably, and to have so
protected the King and the Queen Mother that they would destroy this
pestiferous root with such prudence and at such an opportune momen t
when all their rebels were locked in the cage.”®^ When the tidings
reached Rome the Cardinal of Lorraine, out of ungovernable happiness,
gave the bearer a thousand crowns. Soon all Rome was illumi- nated;
salvos were fired from Castel Sant’ Angelo; be lls rang joyously;
Gregory XIII and his cardinals attended a solemn Mass of thanksgiving to
God for “this signal favor shown to Christian people,” which had saved
France and the Holy See from great peril. The Pope ordered a special</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>medal struck to commemorate Ugonotorum strages — the defeat or
slaughter of the Huguenots®® — and he engaged Vasari to paint, in the
Sala Regia of the Vatican, a picture of the massacre, bearing the words
Pontifex Colignii necem probat — “The Pope approves the killing of
Coligny.”*®®</p>
<p>Protestant Europe branded the massacre as dastardly barbarism.
William of Orange told the French envoy that Charles IX would never be
able to wash the blood from his hands. In England Elizabeth was beset
with demands for revenge, and bishops advised her that the only way to
quiet the public fury was to put to death at once all Catholics who
were</p>
<p>in prison for having refused to take the oath of allegiance; at least
the Queen of Scots should be executed at once.®® Elizabeth kept her
head. She robed herself in deep mourning to receive the French
ambassador and met with visible unbelief his protestations that the
massacre had been necessitated by imminent Huguenot conspiracy. But she
continued to play France against Spain, and to dally with Alengon’s suit
for her hand; and in November she consented to act as godmother to the
daughter of Charles IX.</p>
<p>Catherine emerged from the shambles cheerful and refreshed; the King
was now again her vassal, and the Huguenot problem seemed solved. She
was mistaken. Though many French Protestants had accepted conversion as
an alternative to death, these recantations proved transitory; within
two months of the massacre the Huguenots opened the Fourth Religious
War; La Rochelle and several other towns closed their gates to royalist
troops and successfully resisted siege. On July 6, 1573, Charles signed
the Peace of La Rochelle, guaranteeing the Huguenots religious liberty.
Politically the massacre had accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>And now the Huguenot intellectuals, who had heretofore professed
loyalty to the King, turned in horror from Charles IX and questioned not
only the divine right of kings but the institution of monarchy
itself.</p>
<p>Fran9ois Hotman, a Huguenot jurist, had fled to Switzerland after the
massacre; a year later he published a passionate attack upon Charles, De
jmoribus Gallicis: the crimes of that King had released his people from
their oath of loyalty; he was a felon and should be deposed. Before the
year was out Hotman sent forth from Geneva his Franco-Gallia, the first
modern attempt at constitutional history. The Gallo-French monarchy, he
argued, had been elective; the king had been, till Louis XI, subject to
a national assembly of one kind or another; the now abject parlements
and the long neglected States-General were the weakened remnants of that
elective</p>
<ul>
<li>The Catholic historian Pastor, wliile not excusing the massacre,
attempts to explain the papal jubilation as relief after fear that the
triumph of Coligny would have brought an end to Catholicism in France,
and the union of France with Protestant England, Holland, Scandinavia,
and northern Germany in a war of extermination (such as Luther had
called for) of Catholicism everywhere.®^</li>

<p>THE DUEL FOR FRANCE</p>
<p>power; and that power had been delegated to these bodies by the
people. “To the people alone belongs the right to elect and depose
kings.”®* He demanded the periodic assembly of the States-General; this
body alone should have the authority to issue laws and make war or
peace, to</p>
<p>appoint to major offices, to regulate the succession, and to depose
bad kings. Here already was the thunder of 1789.</p>
<p>Life itself soon deposed Charles IX. Good and evil in him had
struggled to the point where a constitution congenitally botched had
broken down from the strain. Sometimes he gloated over the hardihood and
the extremity of his crime; at other times he accused himself for having
consented to the massacre, and the cries of butchered Huguenots kept
ringing in his ears, murdering sleep. He began to reproach his mother:
“Who but you is the cause of all this? God’s blood, you are the cause of
it all!” She com - plained that she had a lunatic for a son.*® He became
melancholy and somber, thin and pale. He had always tended to
tuberculosis; now, his resist- ance weakened, it destroyed him; by 1574
he was spitting blood. In the spring his hemorrhages grew more violent,
and he again had visions of his victims. “What bloodshed, what murders!”
he cried to his nurse. “What evil counsel have I followed! O my God,
forgive me!… I am lost!”®^ On liis dying day. May 30, 1574, he called
for Henry of Navarre, whom he embraced affectionately. “Brother,” he
said, “you are losing a good friend. Had I believed all that I was told,
you would not be alive. But I always loved you…. I trust in you alone to
look after my wife and daughter. Pray God for me. Farewell.” Soon
afterward he died. He was not yet</p>
<p>wenty-four.</p>
