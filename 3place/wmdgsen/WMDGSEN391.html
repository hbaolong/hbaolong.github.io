<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci</p>
<p>1452-1519</p>
<p>I. DEVELOPMENT: I452-I482</p>
<p>T HE most fascinating figure of the Renaissance was born on April 15,
1452 near the village of Vinci, some sixty miles from Florence. His</p>
<p>mother was a peasant girl, Caterina, who had not bothered to marry
his father. Her seducer, Piero d’ Antonio, was a Florentine attorney of
some means. In the year of Leonardo’s birth Piero married a woman of his
own rank. Caterina had to be content with a peasant husband; she yielded
her pretty love child to Piero and his wife; and Leonardo was brought up
in semiaristocratic comfort without maternal love. Perhaps in that early
en- vironment he acquired his taste for fine clothing, and his aversion
to women.</p>
<p>He went to a neighborhood school, took fondly to mathematics, music,
and drawing, and delighted his father by his singing and his playing of
the lute. In order to draw well he studied all things in nature with
curiosity, patience, and care; science and art, so remarkably united in
his mind, had there one origin — detailed observation. When he was
turning fifteen his father took him to Verrocchio’s studio in Florence,
and persuaded that versatile artist to accept him as an apprentice. All
the educated world knows Vasari’s story of how Leonardo painted the
angel at the left in Ver - rocchio’s Baptism of Christ, and how the
master was so overwhelmed by the beauty of the figure that he gave up
painting and devoted himself to sculpture. Probably this abdication is a
post-mortem legend; Verrocchio made several pictures after the Baptism.
Perhaps in these apprentice days Leonardo painted the Annunciation in
the Louvre, with its awkward angel and its startled maid. He could
hardly have learned grace from Verroc- chio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ser Piero prospered, bought several properties, moved his
family to Florence (1469), and married four wives in turn. The second
was only ten years older than Leonardo. When the third presented Piero
with a child Leonardo eased the congestion by going to live with
Verroc-</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>chio. In that year (1472) he was admitted to membership in the
Company of St. Luke. This guild, composed chiefly of apothecaries,
physicians, and artists, had its headquarters in the hospital of Santa
Maria Nuova. Pre- sumably Leonardo found there some opportunities to
study internal as well as external anatomy. Perhaps in those years he —
or was it he? — painted the gaunt anatomical St. Jerome ascribed to him
in the Vatican Gallery. And it was probably he who, toward 1474, painted
the colorful and immature Annunciation of the Uffizi.</p>
<p>A week before his twenty-fourth birthday Leonardo and three other
youths were summoned before a committee of the Florentine Signory to
answer a charge of having had homosexual relations. The result of this
summons is unknown. On June 7, 1476, the accusation was repeated; the
committee imprisoned Leonardo briefly, released him, and dismissed the
charge as unproved. 1 Unquestionably he was a homosexual. As soon as he
could afford to have his own studio he gathered handsome young men about
him; he took some of them with him on his migrations from city to city;
he referred to one or another of them in his manuscripts as amantis-
simo or carissimo — “most beloved,” “dearest.” 2 What his intimate
relations with these youths were we do not know; some passages in his
notes suggest a distaste for sexual congress in any form.* Leonardo
might reasonably doubt why he and a few others had been singled out for
public accusation when homosexuality was so widespread in the Italy of
the time. He never forgave Florence for the indignity of his arrest.</p>
<p>Apparently he took the matter more seriously than the city did. A</p>
<p>year after the accusation he was invited, and agreed, to accept a
studio in the Medici gardens; and in 1478 the Signory itself asked him
to paint an altarpiece for the chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo
Vecchio. For some reason he did not carry out the assignment;
Ghirlandaio took it over; Filippino Lippi completed it. Nevertheless the
Signory soon gave him — and Botticelli — another commission: to paint —
we cannot say to the life- full-length portraits of two men hanged for
the conspiracy of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici.
Leonardo, with his half -morbid interest in human deformity and
suffering, may have felt some fascination in the gruesome task.</p>
<p>But indeed he was interested in everything. All postures and actions

<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>

<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>the human body, all expressions of the face in young and old, all the
organs and movements of animals and plants from the waving of wheat in
the field to the flight of birds in the air, all the cyclical erosion
and elevation of mountains, all the currents and eddies of water and
wind, the moods of the weather, the shades of the atmosphere, and the
inexhaustible kaleido- scope of the sky — all these seemed endlessly
wonderful to him; repetition never dulled for him their marvel and
mystery; he filled thousands of pages with observations concerning them,
and drawings of their myriad forms. When the monks of San Scopeto asked
him to paint a picture for their chapel (1481), he made so many sketches
for so many features and forms of it that he lost himself in the
details, and never finished The Adoration of the Magi.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is one of his greatest paintings. The plan from which
he developed it was drawn on a strictly geometrical pattern of
perspective, with the whole space divided into diminishing squares; the
mathematician in Leonardo always competed — often co-operated — with the
artist. But the artist was already developed; the Virgin had the pose
and features that she would keep in Leonardo’s work to the end; the Magi
were drawn with a remarkable understanding — for a youth — of character
and expression in old men; and the “Philosopher” at the left was li
terally a brown study of half-skeptical meditation, as if the painter
had so soon come to view the Christian story with a spirit unwillingly
incredulous and still devout. And around these figures half a hundred
others gathered, as if every kind of man and woman had hurried to this
crib seeking hungrily the meaning of life and some Light of the World,
and finding the answer in a stream of births.</p>
<p>The unfinished masterpiece, almost erased by time, hangs in the
Uffizi at Florence, but it was Filippino Lippi who executed the painting
ac- cepted by the Scopetini brotherhood. To begin, to conceive too
richly, to lose himself in experimenting with details; to see beyond his
subject a boundless perspective of human, animal, plant, and
architectural forms, of rocks and mountains, streams and clouds and
trees, in a mystic chiaroscuro light; to be absorbed in the philosophy
of the picture rather than in its technical accomplishment; to leave to
others the lesser task of coloring the figures so drawn and placed for
revealing significance; to turn in despair, after long labor of mind and
body, from the imperfection with which the hand and the materials had
embodied the dream: this was to be Leonardo’s character and fate, with a
few exceptions, to the end.</p>

<li>IN MILAN: 1482-99</li>
</ol>
<p>There was nothing hesitant, no sense yet of the merciless brevity of
time, only youth’s limitless ambitions fed by burgeoning powers, in the
letter that Leonardo, now thirty, sent in 1482 to Lodovico, regent of
Milan. He had had enough of Florence; the desire to see new places and
faces mounted in his blood. He had heard that Lodovico wanted a military
engineer, an architect, a sculptor, a painter; well, he would offer
himself as all these in one. And so he wrote his famous letter:</p>
<p>Most Illustrious Lord, having now sufficiently seen and
considered</p>
<p>the proofs of all those who count themselves masters and inventors of
instruments of war, and finding that their invention and use of the said
instruments does not differ in any respect from those in common
practice, I am emboldened without prejudice to anyone else to put</p>
<p>myself in communication with your Excellency, in order to
acquaint</p>
<p>you with my secrets, thereafter offering myself at your pleasure</p>
<p>effectually to demonstrate at any convenient time all those matters
which are in part briefly recorded below.</p>

<p>whom I commend myself with all possible humility.</p>
<p>We do not know how Lodovico replied, but we know that Leonardo</p>
<p>reached Milan in 1482 or 1483, and soon made his way into the heart
of “the Moor.” One story has it that Lorenzo, as a dip lomatic bonbon,
had sent him to Lodovico to deliver a handsome lute; another that he won
a musical contest there, and was retained not for any of the powers that
he had claimed “with all possible humility,” but for the music of his
voice, the charm of his conversation, the soft sweet tone of the lyre
that his own hands had fashioned in the form of a horse’s head. 5
Lodovico seems to have accepted him not at his own valuation but as a
brilliant youth who — even though he might be less of an architect than
Bramante, and too inex- perienced to be entrusted with military
engineering — might plan court masques and city pageants, decorate
dresses for wife or mistress or princess, paint murals and portraits,
and perhaps construct canals to improve the irrigation of the Lombard
plain. It offends us to learn that the myriad- minded man had to spend
irrecoverable time making curious girdles for Lodovico’s pretty bride,
Beatrice d’Este, conceiving costumes for jousts and festivals,
organizing pageants, or decorating stables. But a Renaissance artist was
expected to do all these things between Madonnas; Bramante too shared in
this courtlery; and who knows but the woman in Leonardo delighted in
designing dresses and jewelry, and the accomplished equestrian</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>in him enjoyed painting swift horses on stable walls? He adorned the
ball- room of the Castello for the marriage of Beatrice, built a special
bathroom for her, raised in the garden a pretty pavilion for her summer
joy, and painted other rooms — camerini — for palace celebrations. He
made portraits of Lodovico, Beatrice, and their children, of Lodovico’s
mistresses Cecilia Gallerani and Lucrezia Crivelli; these paintings are
lost, unless La Belle Ferroniere of the Louvre is Lucrezia. Vasari
speaks of the family portraits as “marvelous,” and the picture of
Lucrezia inspired a poet to a fervid eulogy of the lady’s beauty and the
artist’s skill. 6</p>
<p>Perhaps Cecilia was Leonardo’s model for The Virgin of the Rocks.</p>
<p>The painting was contracted for (1483) by the Confraternity of the
Con- ception as the central part of an altarpiece for the church of San
Francesco. The original was later bought by Francis I and is in the
Louvre. Standing before it, we note the softly maternal face that
Leonardo would use a dozen times in later works; an angel recalling one
in Verrocchio’s Baptism of Christ; two infants exquisitely drawn; and a
background of jutting, overhanging rocks that only Leonardo could have
conceived as Mar y’s habitat. The colors have been darkened by time, but
possibly the artist intended a darkling effect, and suffused his
pictures with a hazy atmos- phere that Italy calls sfumato — “smoked.”
This is one of Leonardo’s great - est pictures, surpassed only by The
Last Supper, Mona Lisa, and The Virgin, Child, and St. Anne.</p>
<p>The Last Supper and Mona Lisa are the world’s most famous paintings.
Hour -after hour, day after day, year after year, pilgrims enter the re-
fectory that holds Leonardo’s most ambit ious work. In that simple rec-
tangular building the Dominican friars who were attached to Lodovico’s
favorite church — Santa Maria delle Grazie — took their meals. Soon
after the artist arrived in Milan Lodovico asked him to represent the
Last Supper on the farthest wall of this refectory. For three years
(1495-8), on and off, Leonardo labored or dallied at the task, while
Duke and friars fretted over his incalculable delays. The prior (if we
may believe Vasari) com- plained to Lodovico of Leonardo’s apparent
sloth, and wondered why he would sometimes sit before the wall for hours
without painting a stroke. Leonardo had no trouble explaining to the
Duke — who had some trouble explaining to the prior — that an artist’s
most important work lies in con - ception rather than in execution, and
(as Vasari put it) “men of genius do most when they work least.” There
were in this case, said Leonardo to Lodovico, two special difficulties —
to conceive features worthy of the</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) LEONARDO DA VINCI 20 5</p>
<p>Son of God, and to picture a man as heartless as Judas; perhaps, he
slyly suggested, he might use the too frequently seen face of the prior
as a model for Iscariot.* Leonardo hunted throughout Milan for heads and
faces that might serve him in representing the Apostles; from a hundred
such quarries he chose the features that were melted in the mintage of
his art into those astonishingly individualized heads that make the
wonder of the dying masterpiece. Sometimes he would rush from the
streets or his studio to the refectory, add a stroke or two to the
picture, and depart. 8</p>
<p>The subject was superb, but from a painter’s point of view it was
pitted with hazards. It had to confine itself to male figures and a
modest table in a simple room; there could be only the dimmest landscape
or vista; no grace of women might serve as foil to the strength of the
men; no vivid action could be brought in to set the figures into motion
and convey the sense of life. Leonardo let in a glimpse of landscape
through the three windows behind Christ. As a substitute for action he
portrayed the gather- ing at the tense moment Christ has prophesied that
one of the Apostles will betray Him, and each is asking, in fear or
horror or amazement, “Is it I?” The institution of the Eucharist might
have been chosen, but that would have frozen all thirteen faces into an
immobile and stereotyped solemnity. Here, on the contrary, there is more
than violent physical action; there is a searching and revelation of
spirit; never again, so profoundly, has an artist revealed in one
picture so many souls. For the Apostles Leonardo made numberless
preliminary sketches; some of these — for James the Greater, Philip,
Judas — are drawings of such finesse and power as only Rembrandt and
Michelangelo have matched. When he tried to conceive the features of
Christ, Leonardo found that the Apostles had exhausted his inspiration.
According to Lomazzo (writing in 1557), Leonardo’s old friend Zenale
advised him to leave the face of Christ unfi nished, saying: “Of a truth
it would be impossible to imagine faces lovelier or gentler than those
of James the Greater or James the Less. Accept your misfortune, then,
and leave your Christ incomplete; for otherwise, when compared with the
Apostles, H e would not be their Saviour or their Master.” 8 Leonardo
took the advice. He or a pupil made a famous sketch (now in the Brera
Gal- lery) for the head of Christ, but it pictured an effeminate sadness
and resignation rather than the heroic resolve that calmly entered
Gethsemane.</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>Perhaps Leonardo lacked the reverent piety that, had it been added to
his sensitivity, his depth, and his skill, might have brought the
picture nearer to perfection.</p>
<p>Because he was a thinker as well as an artist, Leonardo shunned
fresco painting as an enemy to thought; such painting on wet and freshly
laid plaster had to be done rapidly before the plaster dried. Leonardo
preferred to paint on a dry wall with tempera — colors mixed in a
gelatinous sub- stance, for this method allowed him to ponder and
experiment. But these colors did not adhere firmly to the surface; even
in Leonardo’s lifetime— what with the usual dampness of the refectory
and its occasional flooding in heavy rains — the paint began to flake
and fall; when Vasari saw the picture (1536) it was already blurred;
when Lomazzo saw it, sixty years after its completion, it was already
ruined beyond repair. The friars later helped decay by cutting a door
through the legs of the Apostles into the kitchen (1656). The engraving
by which the painting has been repro- duced throughout the world was
taken not from the spoiled original but from an imperfect copy made by
one of Leonardo’s pupils, Marco d’Og - giono. Today we can study only
the composition and the general out- lines, hardly the shades or
subtleties. But whatever were the defects of the work when Leonardo left
it, some realized at once that it was the greatest painting that
Renaissance art had yet produced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1483) Leonardo had undertaken a work completely differ-
ent and still more difficult. Lodovico had long wished to commemorate
his father, Francesco Sforza, witli an equestrian statue that would bear
comparison with Donatello’s Gattamelata at Padua and Verrocchio’s Col -
leoni in Venice. Leonardo ’s ambition was stirred. He set himself to
study - ing the anatomy, action, and nature of the horse, and drew a
hundred sketches of the animal, nearly all of snorting vivacity. Soon he
was ab- sorbed in making a plaster model. When some citizens of Piacenza
asked him to recommend an artist to design and cast bronze doors for
their cathedral he wrote characteristically in reply: “There is no one
who is capable except Leonardo the Florentine, who is making the bronze
horse of the Duke Francesco, and you need take no count of him, for he
has work that will last his whole lifetime; and I fear that it is so
great an under- taking that he will never finish it.” 10 Lodovico at
times thought so too, and</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>At last (1493) the plaster model was finished; all that remained was
to cast it in bronze. In November the model was set up publicly under an
arqh to adorn the wedding procession of Lodovico’s niece Bianca Maria.
Men marveled at its size and splendor; horse and rider rose to
twenty-six feet; poets wrote sonnets in its praise; and no one doubted
that when cast it would surpass in power and life the masterpieces of
Donatello and Ver- rocchio. But it was never cast. Apparently Lodovico
could not spare</p>
<p>funds for the fifty tons of bronze required. The model was left in
the open while Leonardo busied himself with art and boys, with science
and experiments, with mechanisms and manuscripts. When the French cap-
tured Milan (1499) their bowmen made a target of the plaster cavallo,
and broke off many pieces of it. Louis XII, in 1501, expressed a desire
to cart it off to France as a trophy. We do not hear of it again.</p>
<p>The great fiasco unnerved and exhausted Leonardo for a time, and may
have disturbed his relations with the Duke. Normally Lodovico paid his
“Apelles” well; a cardinal was surprised to learn that Leo nardo
received 2000 ducats (5,000?) a year, in addition to many gifts and
privileges. 11 The artist lived like an aristocrat: he had several
apprentices, servants, pages, horses; engaged musicians; dressed in
silks and furs, embroidered gloves, and fancy leather boots. Though he
produced works beyond price, he seemed at times to dally with his
assignments, or to interrupt them for his private researches and
compositions in science, philosophy, and art. In 1497, tired of such
delays, Lodovico invited Perugino to come and decorate some rooms in the
Castello. Perugino could not come, and Leonardo took over the
assignment, but the incident left hurt feelings on both sides. About
this time Lodovico, straitened in his finances by diplomatic and milita
ry expenses, fell behind in paying Leonardo’s salary. Leonardo paid his
own costs for almost two years, and then sent the Duke a gentle reminder
( 1498). Lodovico excused himself graciously, and a year later gave
Leonardo a vineyard as a source of revenue. By that time Lodo- vico’s
political edifice was falling about him; the French captured Milan,
Lodovico fled, and Leonardo found himself uncomfortably free.</p>
<p>He moved to Mantua (December, 1499), and there made a remarkable
drawing of Isabella d’Este . She let her husband give it away as the
first stage of its journey to the Louvre; and Leonardo, not relishing
such</p>
<p>generosity, passed on to Venice. He marveled at its proud beauty, but
found its rich colors and Gothic-Byzantine ornaments too bright for his
Florentine taste. He turned his steps back to the city of his youth.</p>

</ol>
<p>He was forty-eight when he tried to take up again the cords of life
that he had snapped some seventeen years before. He had changed;
Florence had, too, but divergently. She had become in his absence a
half-demo- cratic, half-puritan republic; he was accustomed to ducal
rule and to soft aristocratic luxuries and ways. The Florentines, always
critical, looked askance at his silks and velvets, his gracious manners,
and his retinue of curly-headed youths. Michelangelo, twenty-two years
his junior, resented the good looks that so contrasted with his own
broken nose, and wondered, in his poverty, where Leonardo found the
funds to maintain so rich a life. Leonardo had salvaged some six hundred
ducats from his Milan days; now he refused many commissions, even from
the imperious Marchesa of Mantua; and when he worked it was with his
wonted leisureliness.</p>
<p>The Servite friars had engaged Filippino Lippi to paint an
altarpiece</p>
<p>for their church of the Annunziata; Leonardo casually expressed his
desire to do a similar work; Filippino courteously surrendered the
assignment to the man then generally considered to be the greatest
painter in Europe. The Servites brought Leonardo and his “household” to
live at the monas - tery, and paid their expenses for what seemed a very
long time. Then one day in 1501 he unveiled the cartoon for his proposed
picture of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and the Infant St. John.
It “not only filled every artist with wonder,” says Vasari, “but when it
was set up . . . men and women, young and old, flocked for two days to
see it, as if in festival time, and they marveled excee dingly.” We do
not know if this was the full -size drawing that is now a treasured
possession of the Royal Academy of Arts in Burlington House, London;
probably it was, though French authorities 12 like to believe that it
was the first form of the quite different picture in the Louvre. The
smile of tender pride that softens and brightens the face of the Virgin
in the cartoon is one of Leonardo’s miracles; beside it the smile of
Mona Lisa is earthly and cynical. Nevertheless, though this is among the
greatest of Renaissance drawings, it is unsuccessful; there is something
ungainly, and in poor taste, in seating the Virgin unstably across the
widespread legs of her mother. Leonardo apparently neglected to
transform this sketch into a picture for the Servites; they had to turn
back to Lippi, and then to Perugino, for their altarpiece. But soon
afterward, perhaps from a variant of the Burlington cartoon, Leonardo
painted The Virgin, St. Anne, and the Infant Jesus of the Louvre. This
is a technical tr iumph, from Anne’s diademed head to Mary’s feet—
scandalously naked</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>but divinely fair. The triangular composition that had failed in the
cartoon here came to full success: the four heads of Anne, Mary, the
Child, and the lamb make one rich line; the Child and His grandmother
are intent on Mary, and the incomparable draperies of the women fill out
the divergent space. The characteristic sfumato of Leonardo’s brush has
softened all outlines, as shadows soften them in life. The Leonardesque
smile, on Mary in the cartoon but on Anne in the painting, set a fashion
that would con- tinue in Leonardo’s followers for half a century.</p>
<p>From the mystic ecstasy of these tender evocations Leonardo passed,
by an almost incredible transition, to serve Caesar Borgia as military
engi- neer (June, 1502). Borgia was beginning his third campaign in the
Ro- magna; he wanted a man who could make topographical maps, build and
equip fortresses, bridge or divert streams, and invent weapons of
offense and defense. Perhaps he had heard of the ideas that Leonardo had
ex- pressed or drawn for new engines of war. There was, for example, his
sketch for an armored car or tank, whose wheels were to be moved by
soldiers within its wal ls. “These cars,” Leonardo had written, “take
the place of elephants . . . one may tilt with them; one may hold
bellows in them to terrify the horses of the enemy; one may put
carabineers in them to break up every company.” 13 Or, said Leonardo,
you can put terrible scythes on the flanks of a chariot, and a still
more lethal revolving scythe on a forward projecting shaft; these would
mow down men like a field of grain. 14 Or you can make the wheels of the
chariot turn a mechanism that will swing deadly flails at four ends. 15
You can attack a fort by placing your soldiers under some protective
covering; 16 and you can repel besiegers by throwing down upon them
bottles of poison gas. 17 Leonardo had planned a “book of how to drive
back armies by the fury of floods caused by releasing waters,” and a
“book of how to inundate armies by closing the outlets” of waters
flowing through valleys. 18 He had designed devices for mechanically
discharging a succession of arrows from a revolving plat- form, for
raising cannon upon a carriage, for toppling over the crowded ladders of
a besieging force attempting to scale the walls. 19 Borgia put most of
these contraptions aside as impracticable; he tried one or two in the
siege of Ceri in 1503. Nevertheless he issued the following patent of
au- thority (August, 1502):</p>
<p>To all our lieutenants, castellans, captains, condottieri,
officials,</p>
<p>soldiers, and subjects. We constrain and command that the bearer,</p>
<p>our most excellent and well-beloved servant, architect, and engineer-
in-chief, Leonardo Vinci — whom we have appointed to inspect</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>strongholds and fortresses in our dominions to the end that accord-
ing to their need and his counsel we may be enabled to provide for</p>
<p>their necessities — to accord a passage absolutely free from any toll
or tax, a friendly welcome both for himself and his company; free-</p>
<p>dom to see, examine and take measurements precisely as hi may</p>
<p>wish; and for this purpose assistance in men as many as he may de-
sire; and all possible aid and favor. It is our will that in the
execution of any works in our dominions every engineer will be bound to
con- fer with him and follow his advice. 20</p>
<p>Leonardo wrote much, but rarely about himself. We should have</p>
<p>relished his opinion of Borgia, and might have put it illuminatingly
beside that of the envoy whom Florence was sending to Caesar at this
time — Nic- colo Machiavelli. But all that we know is that Leonardo
visited Imola, Faenza, Forli, Ravenna, Rimini, Pesaro, Urbino, Perugia,
Siena, and other cities; that he was in Senigallia when Caesar snared
and strangled there four treasonable captains; and that he presented
Caesar with six extensive maps of central Italy, showing the direction
of the streams, the nature and con- tours of the terrain, the distances
between rivers, mountains, fortresses, and towns. Then suddenly he
learned that Caesar was almost dead in Rome, the Caesarian empire was
collapsing, and an enemy of the Borgias was mounting the papal throne.
Once more Leonardo, his new world of action fading before him, turned
back to Florence (April, 1503).</p>
<p>In October of that year Pietro Soderini, head of the Florentine
govern- ment, proposed to Leonardo and Michelangelo that each should
paint a mural in the new Hall of the Five Hundred in the Palazzo
Vecchio. Both men accepted, strict contracts were drawn up, and the
artists retired to separate studios to design their guiding cartoons.
Each was to picture some triumph of Florentine arms: Angelo an action in
the war with Pisa, Leonardo the victory of Florence over Milan at
Anghiari. The alert citi- zens followed the progress of the work as a
contest of gladiators; argu- ment rose excitedly on the rival merits and
styles; and some observers thought that any definite superiority of one
picture over the other would decide whether later painters would follow
Leonardo’s bent toward deli - cate and subtle representation of feeling,
or Michelangelo’s penchant for mighty muscles and demonic force.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was at this time (for the incident has no date) that
the</p>
<p>younger artist let his dislike of Leonardo come to flagrant insult.
One day some Florentines in the Piazza Santa Trinita were discussing a
passage in The Divine Comedy. Seeing Leonardo pass, they stopped him and
asked</p>
<p>CHAP. VII ) LEONARDO DA VINCI 211</p>
<p>for his interpretation. At that moment Michelangelo appeared, who was
known to have studied Dante zealously. “Here is Michelangelo,” said
Leonardo; “he will explain the verses.” Thinking that Leonardo was</p>
<p>making fun of him, the unhappy Titan broke out in violent scorn: “Ex
- plain them yourself! You who made the model of a horse to be cast in
bronze and could not cast it, and left it unfinished, to your shame! And
those Mi lanese capons thought you could do it!” Leonardo, we are told,
flushed deeply, but made no reply; Michelangelo marched off fuming.
21</p>
<p>Leonardo prepared his cartoon carefully. He visited the scene of the
engagement at Anghiari, read reports of it, made innumerable sketches of
horses and men in the passion of battle or the agony of death. Now, as
seldom in Milan, he found an opportunity to put movement into his art.
He took full advantage of it, and depicted such a fury of mortal
conflict that Florence almost shuddered at the sight; no one had
supposed that this most refined of Florentine artists could conceive or
picture such a vision of patriotic homicide. Perhaps Leonardo used here
his experience in Caesar Borgia’s campaign; the horrors that he m ay
then have witnessed could be expressed in his drawing and exorcised from
his mind. By February of 1505 he had finished his cartoon, and began to
paint its central picture — The Battle of the Standard — in the Sala dei
Cinquecento.</p>
<p>But now again he who had studied physics and chemistry, and had not
yet learned the fate of his Last Supper , made a tragic mistake.
Experiment- ing with encaustic techniques, he thought to fix the colors
into the stucco wall by heat from a brazier on the floor. The room was
damp, the winter was cold, the heat did not reach high enough, the
stucco failed to absorb the paint, the upper .colors began to run, and
no frenzied effort availed to halt the ruin. Meanwhile financial
difficulties arose. The Signory was paying Leonardo fifteen florins
(88?) per month, hardly to be com- pared with the 160 or so that
Lodovico had assigned him in Afilan. When a tactless official offered
the month’s payment in coppers, Leonardo re - jected them. He abandoned
the enterprise in shame and despair, only moderately consoled by the
fact that Michelangelo, after completing his cartoon, made no painting
from it at all, but accepted a call from Pope Julius II to come and work
in Rome. The great competition was a sorry mess that left Florence ill
disposed toward the two greatest artists in her history.</p>
<p>On and off, during the years 1503-6, Leonardo painted the portrait of
Mona Lisa — i.e., Madonna Elisabetta, third wife of Francesco del Gio-
condo, who in 1512 was to be a member of the Signory. Presumably a</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>child of Francesco, buried in 1499, was one of Elisabetta’s children,
and this loss may have helped to mold the serious features behind La
Gio- conda’s smile. That Leonardo should call he r back to his studio so
many times during those three years; that he should spend upon her
portrait all the secrets and nuances of his art — modeling her softly
with light and shade, framing her in a fanciful vista of trees and
waters, mountains and sky- clothing her in raiment of velvet and satin
woven into folds whose every wrinkle is a masterpiece — studying with
passionate care the subtle muscles that form and move the mouth —
bringing musicians to play for her and to evoke upon her features the
disillusioned tenderness of a mother remem- bering a departed child:
these are inklings of the spirit in which he came to this engaging
merger of painting and philosophy. A thousand inter- ruptions, a hundred
distracting interests, the simultaneous struggle with the Anghiari
design, left unbroken the unity of his conception, the un- wonted
pertinacity of his zeal.</p>
<p>This, then, is the face that launched a thousand reams upon a sea of
ink. Not an unusually lovely face; a shorter nose would have launched
more reams; and many a lass in oil or marble — as in any Correggio —
would by comparison make Lisa only moderately fair. It is her smile that
has made her fortune through the centuries — a nascent twinkle in her
eyes, an amused and checked upcurving of her lips. What is she smiling
at? The efforts of the musicians to entertain her? The leisurely
diligence of an artist who paints her through a thousand days and never
makes an end? Or is it not just Mona Lisa smiling, but woman, all women,
saying to all me n: “Poor impassioned lovers! A Nature blindly
commanding continuance burns your nerves with an absurd hunger for our
flesh, softens your brains with a quite unreasonable idealization of our
charms, lifts you to lyrics that subside with consummation — and all
that you may be precipitated into parentage! Could anything be more
ridiculous? But we too are snared; we women pay a heavier price than you
for your infatuation. And yet, sweet fools, it is pleasant to be
desired, and life is redeemed when we are loved.” Or was it only the
smile of Leonardo himself that Lisa wore— of the inverted spirit that
could hardly recall the tender touch of a woman’s hand, and could
believe in no other destiny for love or genius than obscene
decomposition, and a little fame flickering out in man’s
forgetfulness?</p>
<p>When at last the sittings ended, Leonardo kept the picture, claiming
that this most finished of all portraits was still incomplete. Perhaps
the husband did not like the prospect of having his wife curl up her
lips at him and his guests, hour after hour from his walls. Many years
later Francis I bought</p>

<p>it for 4000 crowns (0,000),“ and framed it in his palace at Fontaine
- bleau. Today, after time and restorations have blurred its subtleties,
it hangs in the majestic Salon Carre of the Louvre, daily amused by a
thou- sand worshipers, and waiting for time to efface and confirm Mona
Lisa’s smile.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>IN MILAN AND ROME: 1506-16</li>
</ol>
<p>Contemplating such a picture, and reckoning how many hours of</p>
<p>thought must have guided so many minutes of the brush, we revise our
judgment of Leonardo’s seeming sloth, and perceive again that his work
embodied the meditations of numberless inactive days; as when an author
on an eveni ng’s stroll, or lying sleepless in the night, molds the next
day’s chapter, page, or verse, or rolls on the mind’s tongue some savory
adjective</p>
<p>However, science brought no fees; and though he was living simply</p>
<p>now, he must have mourned the passing of those days when he had been
the artist prince of Milan. When Charles d’Amboise, viceroy of Milan for
Louis XII, invited him to return, Leonardo asked Soderini might he be
excused for a few months from his commitments to Florence. Soderini
complained that Leonardo had not yet earned the money paid him for The
Battle of Anghiari; Leonardo raised the unearned sum and brought it to
Soderini, who refused it. Finally ( 1 506) Soderini, anxious to keep the
good will of the French King, let Leonardo go on condition that he
return to Florence after three months, or pay a penalty of 150 ducats
(875?). He went; and though he revisited Florence in 1507, 1509, and
1511, he remained in the employ of Amboise and Louis in Milan till 1513.
Soderini protested, but Louis overruled him with the gracious courtesy
of confident strength. To make matters quite clear, Louis in 1 507
appointed Leonardo peintre et ingenieur ordinaire — painter and engineer
in ordinary — to the King of France.</p>
<p>It was no sinecure; Leonardo earned his keep. We hear of him
again</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>21 4</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>decorating palaces, designing or building canals, preparing pageants,
paint- ing pictures, planning an equestrian monument of Marshal
Trivulzio, and collaborating in anatomical studies with Marcantonio
della Torre. Proba- bly during this second stay at Milan he painted two
pictures that came from the lower levels of his genius. The St. John of
the Louvre has the rounded contours of a woman, and such flowing curls
and delicate features as might have graced a Magdalen. Leda and the Swan
(in a private col- lection in Rome) has a face and fleshly softness
recalling the St. John and the Bacchus formerly ascribed to Leonardo;
but it is most likely a copy from a lost painting or cartoon by the
master. His fame would have</p>
<p>gained had these pictures died at birth.</p>
<p>In 1 5 1 2 the French were cha sed out of Milan, and Lodovico’s son
Maxi - milian began a brief reign. Leonardo stayed a while, writing
illegibile notes on science and art while Milan burned with fires set by
the Swiss. But in 1513, hearing that Leo X had been chosen pope, he
thought there might be, in Medicean Rome, a place even for an artist of
sixty-one years; and he set out with four of his pupils. At Florence
Leo’s brother, Giuliano de’ Medici, attached Leonardo to his retinue,
and assigned him a monthly stipend of thirty-three ducats (12?). Arrived
in Rome, Leonardo was welcomed by the art-loving Pope, who gave him
rooms in the Belvedere Palace. Presumably Leonardo met — certainly he
influenced — Raphael and Sodoma. Leo may have given him a commission for
a picture, for Vasari tells how surprised the Pope was to find Leonardo
mixing varnish before doing any painting; “this man,” Leo is reported to
have said, “will never do anything, for he begins to think of the last
stage before the first.” 24 In truth Leonardo had now ceased to be a
painter; science more and more ab- sorbed him; he studied anatomy at the
hospital, worked on problems of light, and wrote many pages on geometry.
He amused his leisure by con- structing a mechanical lizard with beard,
horns, and wings, which he made to flutter by an injection of
quicksilver. Leo lost interest in him.</p>
<p>But meanwhile Francis I, a royal lover of art, had succeeded Louis
XII. In October 1515 he recaptured Milan. Apparently he invited Leonardo
to join him there. Early in 1516 Leonardo bade farewell to Italy, and
accom- panied Francis to France.</p>
<p>V. THE MAN</p>
<p>What sort of man was this prince of art? There are several
alleged</p>
<p>portraits of him, but none before fifty. Vasari speaks with unusual
fervor</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>2I 5</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>of “the never adequately praised beauty of his body,” and “the
splendor of his appearance, which was extremely beautiful, and made
every sorrowful soul serene”; but Vasari spoke from hearsay, and we have
no representation</p>
<p>We have suggested that his homosexuality was not innate, but grew out
of the unpleasant relation of a burdened stepmother with a bastard
stepson. His need for receiving and returning affection found
satisfaction with the handsome youths whom he later collected. He drew
women much less frequently than men; he acknowledged their beauty, but
seems to have shared Socrates’ preference for boys. In all the jungle of
his manuscripts there is no word of love or tenderness for women. Yet he
understood well many phases of woman’s nature; no one has surpassed him
in representing virginal delicacy, motherly solicitude, or feminine
subtlety. It may be tha<em>- his sensitiveness, his secretive anagrams
and codes, his double locking of his studio at night, had a root in his
consciousness of abnormality as well as in his fear of being charged
with heresy. He was not anxious to be read by the many. “The truth of
things,” he wrote, “is a supreme food for fin e in- telligences, but not
for wandering wits.” 2 </em></p>
<p>His sexual inversion may have influenced other elements of his
character. He was the soul of gentle kindness to his friends. He
protested against killing animals, “would not allow anyone to hurt any
living thing”; 28 he bought caged birds to free them. 27 In other
aspects he seemed morally in-</p>
<p>2l6</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>sensitive. He was apparently fascinated by the problem of designing
in- struments of war. He appears to have felt no strong resentment
against the French for condemning to a dungeon the Lodovico who for
sixteen years had maintained him handsomely in Milan. He went off
without visible qualm to serve a Borgia whom Florence feared as a threat
to her liberty. Like every artist, every author, and every homosexual,
he was unusually self-conscious, sensitive, and vain. Se til sarai solo
tu sarai tutto tuo, he wrote; “if you are alone, you are all your own;
with a companion you are half yourself; so you squander yourself
according to the indiscretion of your company .” 28 He could shine in
company as a musician or a conver - sationalist, but he liked rather to
isolate himself in rapt concentration on his tasks. “The chief gift of
nature,” he said (never having starved), “is</p>
<p>liberty .” 29</p>
<p>His virtues were the better side of his faults. His aversion to
sexual be- havior may have left him free to spend his blood upon his
work. His pain- ful sensitivity opened up to him a thousand facets of
reality unseen by the common eye. He would follow through a dozen
streets, or all day long, some unusual face, and then, in his studio,
draw it as well as if he had brought the model with him. His mind leaped
at peculiarities — strange forms, actions, ideas. “The Nile,” he wrote,
“h as discharged more water into the sea than is at present contained in
all the waters of the earth”; con - sequently “all the sea and the
rivers have passed through the mouth of the Nile an infinite number of
times .” 30 By a kindred bent he indulged hims elf in queer pranks; so
one day he hid the cleaned gut of a ram in a room, and when his friends
had gathered there, he inflated the gut by a bellows in an adjoining
chamber, until the swelling skin crowded his guests against the walls.
He recorded in his notebooks a variety of second-class fables and
jokes.</p>
<p>His curiosity, his inversion, his sensitivity, his passion for
perfection, all entered into his most fatal defect — the inability or
unwillingess to complete what he had begun. Perhaps he entered upon each
work of art with a view to solve a technical problem of composition,
color, or design, and lost in- terest in the work when the solution had
been found. Art, he said, lies in conceiving and designing, not in the
actual execution; this was labor for lesser minds. Or he pictured to
himself some subtlety, significance, or per- fection that his patient,
and at last impatient, hand could not realize, and he abandoned the
effort in despair, as in the case of the face of Christ . 31 He passed
too quickly from one task or subject to another; he was interested in
too many things; he lacked a unifying purpose, a dominating idea;
this</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>21 ?</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>“universal man” was a medley of brilliant fragments; he was possessed
o f and by too many abilities to harness them to one goal. In the end he
mourned, “I have wasted my hours.” 32</p>
<p>He wrote five thousand pages, but never completed one book. Quantita-
tively he was more an author than an artist. He speaks of having
composed 120 manuscripts; fifty remain. They are written from right to
left in a half-Oriental script that almost lends color to the legend
that at one time he traveled in the Near East, served the Egyptian
sultan, and embraced the Mohammedan faith. 33 His grammar is poor, his
spelling is individualistic. His reading was varied and desultory. He
had a little library of thirty- seven volumes: the Bible, Aesop,
Diogenes Laertius, Ovid, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Dante, Petrarch, Poggio,
Filelfo, Ficino, Pulci, th e T ravels of “Man - deville,” and treatises
on mathematics, cosmography, anatomy, medicine, agriculture, palmistry,
and the art of war. He remarked that “the knowl - edge of past times and
of geography adorns and nourishes the intellect,” 34 but his many
anachronisms show only a scattering acquaintance with his- tory. He
aspired to be a good writer; made several attempts at eloquence, as in
his repeated descriptions of a flood; 35 and wrote vivid accounts of a
tempest and a battle. 36 He clearly intended to publish some of his
writings, and often began to put his notes into order for this purpose.
So far as we know he published nothing during his lifetime; but he must
have allowed some friends to see selected manuscripts, for there are
references to his writings in Flavio Biondo, Jerome Cardan, and
Cellini.</p>
<p>He wrote equally well on science and art, and divided his time almost
evenly between them. The most substantial of his manuscripts is the
Trat- tato della pittura, or Treatise on Painting, first published in
1651. Despite devoted modern editing, it is still a loose aggregation of
fragments, in poor array, and often repetitious. Leonardo anticipates
those who argue that painting can be learned only by painting; he thinks
a sound knowledge of theory helps; and he laughs off his critics as
being like “those of whom Demetrius declared that he took no more
account of the wind that came from their mouths than of that which they
expelled from their lower parts.” 37 His basic precept is that the
student of art should study nature rather than copy the works of other
artists. “See to it, O painter, that when you go into the fields you
give your attention to the various objects, looking carefully in turn
first at one object then at another, making a bundle of different things
selected among those of less value.” 33 Of course the painter must study
anatomy, perspective, modeling by light and shade; boundaries sharply
defined make a picture seem wooden. “Always make</p>
<p>2 I 8</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>the figure so that the bosom is not turned in the same direction as
the head ”; 39 here is one secret of the grace in Leonardo’s own
compositions. Finally he urges: “Make figures with such action as may
suffice to show what the figure has in mind .” 40 Did he forget to do
this with Mona Lisa, or did he exaggerate our ability to read the soul
in the eyes and the lips?</p>
<p>Leonardo the man appears more clearly and variously in his drawings
than in his paintings or his notes. Their number is legion; one
manuscript alone — the Codice Atlantico in Milan — has seventeen
hundred. Many are hasty sketches; many are such masterpieces that we
must rank Leonardo as the ablest, subtlest, profoundest draughtsman of
the Renaissance; there is nothing in the drawings of Michelangelo or
Rembrandt that can match the amazing Virgin , Christ , and St. Anne in
Burlington House. Leonardo used silverpoint, charcoal, red chalk, or pen
and ink to draw almost every phase of physical, many of spiritual life.
A hundred putti or bambini</p>
<p>spread their fat and dimpled legs in his sketches; a hundred youths,
half Greek in profile, half woman in soul; a hundred pretty maidens, of
demure and tender mien, hair waving in the wind; athletes proud of their
muscles, and warriors breathing battle or gleaming with armor and arms;
saints from the soft beauty of Sebastian to the haggard skin of Jerome;
gentle madon- nas seeing the world redeemed in their babes; complex
drawings of cos- tumes for masquerades; and studies of shawls and
scarves and laces and robes caressing the head or the neck, curling on
the arm, or falling from shoulder or knee in folds that catch the light,
invite the touch, and seem more real than the garments on our flesh. All
these forms sing the zest and marvel of life; but scattered among them
are horrible grotesques and caricatures — deformed heads, leering
imbeciles, bestial faces, crippled bodies, shrews contorted with fury, a
Medusa with snakes for hair, men desiccated and corrugated with age,
women in the last stages of decay; this was another side of reality, and
Leonardo’s impartial universal eye caught it, fixed it, put it down
resolutely on his sheets, as if to look ugly evil squarely in the face.
He kept these horrors out of his paintings, which owed some loyalty to
beauty, but he had to find room for them in his philosophy.</p>
<p>Perhaps nature pleased him more than man did, for nature was neutral,
and could not be accused of evil as malice; everything in her was
forgivable to an unbiased eye. So Leonardo drew many landscapes, and
scolded Bot- ticelli for ignoring them; he followed the tendrils of
flowers faithfully with his pen; he hardly painted a picture without
giving it added magic and depth by a background of trees, streams,
rocks, mountains, clouds, and sea.</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>2I 9</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>He almost banished architectural forms from his art so that he might
leave more room for nature to enter and absorb the painted individual or
group into the reconciling totality of things.</p>
<p>Sometimes Leonardo tried his hand at architectural design, but with
chastening unsuccess. There are architectural fantasies among his draw-
ings, quaint and half Syrian. He liked domes, and made a pretty sketch
for a kind of St. Sophia that Lodovico might build in A4ilan; it never
rose from the ground. Lodovico sent him to Pavia to help redesign the
cathedral there, but Leonardo found the mathematicians and anatomists of
Pavia more interesting than the cathedral. He mourned the noise, filth,
and narrow congestion of Italian towns, studied town planning, and
submitted to Lodovico a sketch for a city of two levels. On the lower
level would move all commercial traffic, “and loads for the service and
convenience of the common people”; the upper level would be a roadway
twenty braccia (some forty feet) wide, upheld by colonnaded arcades, and
“not to be used by vehicles, but solely for the convenience of the
gentlefolk”; spiral staircases would occasionally connect the two
levels, and every here and there a fountain would cool and cleanse the
air. 41 Lodovico had no funds for such an upheaval, and the Milanese
aristocracy remained on the earth.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE INVENTOR</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hard for us to realize that to Lodovico, as to Caesar Borgia,
Leonardo was primarily an engineer. Even the pageants that he planned
for the Duke of Milan included ingenious automata. “Every day,” says
Vasari, “he made models and designs for the removal of mountains with
ease, and to pierce them to pass from one place to another; and by means
of levers, cranes, afid winches to raise and draw heavy weights; he
devised methods for Cleaning harbors, and for raising water from great
depths.” 42 He developed a machine for cutting threads in screws; he
worked along correct lines to- wards a water wheel; he devised
frictionless roller-bearing band brakes. 43 He designed the first
machine gun, and mortars with cog gears to elevate their range; a
multiple-belt drive; three-speed transmission gears; an ad- justable
monkey wrench; a machine for rolling metal; a movable bed for a printing
press; a self-locking worm gear for raising a ladder. 44 He had a plan
for underwater navigation, but refused to explain it. 45 He revived the
idea of Hero of Alexandria for a steam engine, and showed how steam
pressure in a gun could propel an iron bolt twelve hundred yards. He in-
vented a device for winding and evenly distributing yarn on a
revolving</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>spindle , 48 and scissors that would open and close with one movement
of the hand. Often he let his fancy bemuse him, as when he suggested in-
flated skis for walking on water, or a water mill that would
simultaneously play several musical instruments . 47 He described a
parachute: “If a man have a tent made of linen, of which the apertures
have all been stopped up, and it be twelve cubits across and twelve in
depth, he will be able to throw himself down from any great height
without sustaining any injury .” 48 Through half his life he pondered
the problem of human flight. Like</p>
<p>Tolstoi he envied the birds as a species in many ways superior to
man. He studied in detail the operation of their wings and tails, the
mechanics of their rising, gliding, turning, and descending. His sharp
eye noted these movements with passionate curiosity, and his swift
pencil drew and re- corded them. He observed how birds avail themselves
of air currents and pressures. He planned the conquest of the air:</p>
<p>You will make an anatomy of the wings of a bird, together with</p>
<p>the muscles of the breast, which move these wings. And you will do
the same for a man, in order to show the possibility of a man sustain-
ing himself in the air by the beating of wings. 49 . . . The rising of
birds without beating their wings is not produced by anything other
than</p>
<p>their circular movement amid the currents of the wind. 50 . . .
Your</p>
<p>bird should have no other model than the bat, because its membranes
serve as …. a means of binding together the framework of the</p>
<p>wings. 51 . … A bird is an instrument working according to mechani-
cal law. This instrument it is within the power of man to reproduce</p>
<p>with all its movements, but not with a corresponding degree of</p>
<p>strength . 52</p>
<p>He made several drawings of a screw mechanism by which a man, through
the action of his feet, might cause wings to beat fast enough to raise
him into the air . 53 In a brief essay Sul volo , On Flight , he
described a flying machine made by him with strong starched linen,
leather joints, and thongs of raw silk. He called this “the bird,” and
wrote detailed instructions for flying it . 54</p>
<p>If this instrument made with a screw … be turned swiftly, the</p>
<p>said screw will make its spiral in the air, and it will rise high. 55
. . .</p>
<p>Make trial of the machine over the water, so that if you fall you
do</p>
<p>not do yourself any harm. 56 . . . The great bird will take its
first</p>
<p>flight . . . filling the whole world with amazement and all
records</p>
<p>with its fame; and it will bring eternal glory to the nest where it
was born . 57</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>Did he actually try to fly? A note in the Codice Atlantic o™ says:
“To - morrow morning, on the second day of January, 1496, I will make
the thong and the attempt”; we do not know what this m eans. Fazio
Cardano, father of Jerome Cardan the physicist (1501-76), told his son
that Leo- nardo himself had essayed flight. 59 Some have thought that
when Antonio, one of Leonardo’s aides, broke his leg in 1 5 10, it was
in trying to fly one of Leon ardo’s machines. We do not know.</p>
<p>Leonardo was on the wrong tack; human flight came not by imitating
the bird, except in gliding, but by applying the internal combustion
engine to a propellor that could beat the air not downward but backward;
for- ward speed made possible upward flight. But the noblest distinction
of man is his passion for knowledge. Shocked by the wars and crimes of
man- kind, disheartened by the selfishness of ability and the perpetuity
of pov- erty, saddened by the superstitions and credulities with which
the nations and generations gild the brevity and indignities of life, we
feel our race in some part redeemed when we see that it can hold a
soaring dream in its mind and heart for three thousand years, from the
legend of Daedalus and Icarus, through the baffled groping of Leonardo
and a thousand others, to the glorious and tragic victory of our
time.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE SCIENTIST</li>
</ol>
<p>Side by side with his drawings, sometimes on the same page, sometimes
scrawled across a sketch of a man or a woman, a landscape or a machine,
are the notes in which this insatiable mind puzzled over the laws and
oper- ations of nature. Perhaps the scientist grew out of the artist:
Leonardo’s painting compelled him to study anatomy, the laws of
proportion and perspective, the composition and reflection of light, the
chemistry of pig- ments and oils; from these researches he was drawn to
a more intimate in- vestigation of structure and function in plants and
animals; and from these inquiries he rose to a philosophical conception
of universal and invariable natural law. Often the artist peered out
again in the scientist; the scientific drawing might be itself a thing
of beauty, or terminate in a graceful ara- besque.</p>
<p>Like most scientists of his time, Leonardo tended to identify
scientific method with experience rather than experiment. 00 “Remember,”
he coun - sels himself, “when discoursing about water, to adduce first
experience and then reason.” 01 Since any man’s experience can be no
more than a m icro- scopic fragment of reality, Leonardo supplemented
his with reading, which</p>
<p>222 THE RENAISSANCE ( CHAP. VII</p>
<p>can be experience by proxy. He studied carefully but critically the
writ- ings of Albert of Saxony, 62 gained a partial acquaintance with
the ideas of Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and Nicholas of Cusa, and
learned much from association with Luca Pacioli, Marcantonio della
Torre, and other professors in the University of Pavia. But he tested
everything with his own experience. “Whoever refers to authorities in
disputing ideas works with his memory rather than with his reason.” 63
He was the least occult of the thinkers of his age. He rejected alchemy
and astrology, and hoped for a time when “all astrologers will be
castrated.” 64</p>
<p>He tried his hand at almost every science. He took enthusiastically
to mathematics as the purest form of reasoning; he felt a certain beauty
in geometrical figures, and drew some on the same page with a study for
The hast Supper . 65 He expressed vigorously one of the fundamental
principles of science: ’’There is no certainty where one can neither
apply any of the mathematical sciences nor any of those that are based
upon them.” 66 And he proudly echoed Plato: “Let no man who is not a
mathematician rea d the elements of my work.” 67</p>
<p>He was fascinated by astronomy. He proposed to “make glasses in order
to see the moon large,” 68 but apparently he did not make them. He
writes: “The sun does not move . . . the earth is not in the center of
the circle o f the sun, nor in the center of the universe.” 69 “The moon
has every month a winter and a summer.” 76 He discusses acutely the
causes of spots on the moon, and combats, on that matter, the views of
Albert of Saxony. 71 Taking a lead from the same Albe rt, he argues that
since “every heavy substance presses downward, and cannot be upheld
perpetually, the whole earth must become spherical,” and will ultimately
be covered with water. 72</p>
<p>He noticed on high elevations the fossil shells of marine animals,
and concluded that the waters had once reached those altitudes 73
(Boccaccio had suggested this about 1338 in his Filocopo 74 ). He
rejected the notion of a universal flood, 75 and ascribed to the earth
an antiquity that would have shocked the orthodoxy of his time. He
assigned to the accumulations brought down by the Po a duration of
200,000 years. He made a map of Italy as he imagined it to have been in
an early geological era. The Sahara Desert, he thought, had once been
covered with salt water. 76 Mountains have been formed through erosion
by rain. 77 The bottom of the sea is con- tinually rising with the
detritus of all the streams that flow into it. “Very</p>
<p>LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>22 3</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>wickedness but by slow geological action, probably the subsidence of
their soil into the Dead Sea . 80</p>
<p>Leonardo followed avidly the advances made in physics by Jean Buridan
and Albert of Saxony in the fourteenth century. He wrote a hundred pages
on motion and weight, and hundreds more on heat, acoustics, optics,
color, hydraulics, an d magnetism. “Mechanics is the paradise of the
mathe - matical sciences, for by its means one comes to the fruit of
mathematics” in useful work . 81 He delighted in pulleys, cranes, and
levers, and saw no end to what they could lift or move; but he laughed
at seekers for per- petual motion. “Force with material movement, and
weight with percus - sion, are the four accidental powers in which all
the works of mortals have their being and their end .” 82 Despite these
lines he was not a materialist.</p>
<p>He studied the transmission of sound, and reduced its medium to waves
of air. “When the string of a lute is struck it . . . conveys a movement
to a similar string of the same tone on another lute, as one may
convince one- self by placing a straw on the string similar to the one
struck .” 84 He had his own notion of a telephone. “If you cause your
ship to stop, and place the head of a long tube in the water, and place
the other extremity to your ear, you will hear ships at a great distance
from you. You can also do the same by placing the head of the tube upon
the ground, and you will then hear anyone passing at a distance .”
85</p>
<p>But sight and light interested him more than sound. He marveled at
the eye: “Who would believe that so small a space could contain the
images of all the universe?” 86 — and he wondered even more at the power
of the mind to recall an image long past. He gave an excellent
description of the means by which spectacles compensate for the
weakening of the muscles of the eyes . 81 He explained the operation of
the eye by the principle of the camera obscura: in the camera and in the
eye the image is inverted because of the pyramidal crossing of the light
rays that come from the object into the camera or the eye . 88 He
analyzed the refraction of sunlight in the rain- bow. Like Leon Battista
Alberti he had a good notion of complementary colors four centuries
before the definitive work of Michel Chevreul . 89</p>
<p>He planned, began, and left countless notes for, a treatise on water.
The movements of water captivated his eye and mind; he studied placid
and turbulent streams, springs and falls, bubbles and foam, torrents and
cloud- bursts, and the simultaneous fury of wind and rain. “Without
water,” he</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>wrote, repeating Thales after twenty- one hundred years, “nothing can
exist among us .” 90 He anticipated Pascal’s fundamental principle of
hydro - statics — that the pressure exerted upon a fluid is transmitted
by it . 91 He noted that the liquids in communicating vessels keep the
same level . 92 In- heriting Milan’s tradition of hydraulic engineering,
he designed and built canals, suggested ways of conducting navigable
canals under or over the rivers that crossed them, and proposed to free
Florence from her need of Pisa as a port by canalizing the Arno from
Florence to the sea . 93 Leonardo was not a Utopian dreamer, but he
planned his studies and works as if he had a dozen lives to live.</p>
<p>Armed with the great text of Theophrastus on plants, he turned his
alert mind to “natural history.” He examined the system on which leaves
are arranged about their stalks, and formulated its laws. He observed
that the rings in a cross section of a tree trunk record the years of
its growth by their number, and the moisture of the year by their width
. 94 He seems to have shared several delusions of his time as to the
power of certain animals to heal some human diseases by their presence
or their touch . 95 He atoned for this uncharacteristic lapse into
superstition by investigating the anat- omy of the horse with a
thoroughness to which recorded history had no precedent. He prepared a
special treatise on the subject, but it was lost in the French
occupation of Milan. He almost inaugurated modern com- parative anatomy
by studying the limbs of men and animals in juxtaposi- tion. He set
aside the superannuated authority of Galen, and worked with actual
bodies. The anatomy of man he described not only in words but in
drawings that excelled anything yet done in that field. He planned a
book on the subject, and left for it hundreds of illustrations and
notes. He claimed to “have dissected more than thirty human cadavers ,”
96 and his countless drawings of the foetus, the heart, lungs, skeleton,
musculature, viscera, eye, skull, and brain, and the principal organs in
woman, support his claim. He was the first to give — in remarkable
drawings and notes — a scientific representation of the uterus, and he
described accurately the three membranes enclosing the foetus. He was
the first to delineate the cavity of the bone that supports the cheek,
now known as the antrum of High- more. He poured wax into the valves of
the heart of a dead bull to get an exact impression of the chambers. He
was the first to characterize the moderator band ( catena ) of the right
ventricle . 97 He was fascinated by the network of bloodvessels; he
divined the circulation of the blood, but did not quite grasp its
mechanism. “The heart,” he wrote, “is much stronger than the other
muscles. . . . The blood that returns when the heart opens</p>

<p>is not the same as that which closes the valves .” 98 He traced the
blood - vessels, nerves, and muscles of the body with fair accuracy. He
attributed old age to arteriosclerosis, and this to lack of exercise .
99 He began a volume De figuta umana, on the proper proportions of the
human figure as an aid to artists, and some of his ideas were
incorporated in his friend Pacioli’s treatise De divina proportione. He
analyzed the physical life of man from birth to decay, and then planned
a survey of mental life. “Oh, that it may please God to let me also
expound the psychology of the habits of man in such fashion as I am
describing his body !” 100</p>
<p>Was Leonardo a great scientist? Alexander von Humboldt considered him
“the greatest physicist of the fifteenth century ,” 101 and William
Hunter ranked him as “the greatest anatomist of his epoch .” 102 He was
not as origi - nal as Humboldt supposed; many of his ideas in physics
had come down to him from Jean Buridan, Albert of Saxony, and other
predecessors. He was capable of egregious errors, as when he wrote that
“no surface of water that borders upon the air will ever be lower than
that of the sea”; 108 but such slips are remarkably few in so vast a
production of notes on almost everything on the earth or in the sky. His
theoretical mechanics were those of a highly intelligent amateur; he
lacked training, instruments, and time. That he achieved so much in
science, despite these handicaps and his labors in art, is among the
miracles of a miraculous age.</p>
<p>From his studies in so many fields Leonardo rose at times to
philosophy. “O marvelous Necessity! Thou with supreme reason
constrainest all ef - fects to be the direct result of their causes, and
by a supreme and irrevo- cable law every natural action obeys thee by
the shortest possible proc- ess .” 104 This has all the proud ring of
nineteenth -century science, and suggests that Leonardo had shed some
theology. Vasari, in the first edition of his life of the artist, wrote
that he was of “so heretical a cast of mind that he conformed to no
religion whatever, accounting it perchance better to be a philosopher
than a Christian” 1 “ 5 — but Vasari omitted this passage in later
editions. Like many Christians of the time, Leonardo took a fling now
and then at the clergy; he called them Pharisees, accused them of de-
ceiving the simple with bogus miracles, and smiled at the “false coin”
of</p>
<p>mourning because one man died in the Orient .” 107 He seems to have
thought that dead saints were incapable of hearing the prayers addressed
to them . 108 “I could wish that I had such power of language as should
avail me to censure those who would extol the worship of men above that
of the</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>sun. . . . Those who have wished to worship men as gods have made a
very grave error.” 109 He took m ore liberties with Christian
iconography than any other Renaissance artist: he suppressed halos, put
the Virgin across her mother’s knee, and made the infant Jesus try to
bestride the symbolic lamb. He saw mind in matter, and believed in a
spiritual soul, but appar- ently thought that the soul could act only
through matter, and only in harmony with invariable laws. 110 He wrote
that “the soul can never be corrupted with the corruption of the body,”
111 but he added that “death destroys memory as well as life,” 112 and
“without the body the soul can neither act nor feel.” 113 He addressed
the Deity with humility and fervor in some passages; 114 but at other
times he identified God with Nature, Natural Law, and “Necessity.” 115 A
mystic pantheism was his religion until his final years.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>IN FRANCE: 1516-19</li>
</ol>
<p>Arrived in France, Leonardo, sixty-four and ill, was established with
his faithful companion Francesco Melzi, twenty-four, in a pretty house
at Cloux, between the town and chateau of Amboise on the Loire, then the
frequent residence of the King. His contract with Francis I designated
him as “painter, engineer, and architect of the King, and state
mechanician,” at an annual salary of seven hundred crowns (750). Francis
was generous, and appreciated genius even in its decline. He enjoyed
conversation with Leonardo, and “affirmed,” reported Cellini, “that
never had any man come into the world who knew so much as Leonardo, and
that not only in sculp- ture, painting, and architecture, for in
addition he was a great philoso- pher.” 110 Leonardo’s anatomical
drawings amazed the physicians at the French court.</p>
<p>For a time he labored manfully to earn his salary. He arranged
masques and pageants for royal displays; worked on plans to bind the
Loire and the Saone with canals and to drain the marshes of Sologne, 117
and may have shared in designing parts of the Loire chateaux; some
evidence links his</p>
<p>name with the jewel loveliness of Chambord. 118 Probably he did
little paint- ing after 1517, for in that year he suffered a paralytic
stroke that im- mobilized his right side; he painted with his left hand,
but needed both hands for careful work. He was now a wrinkled wreck of
the youth whose repute for beauty of body and face came down to Vasari
across half a century. His once proud self-confidence faded, his
serenity of spirit yielded to the pains of decay, his love of life gave
place to religious hope. He made a simple will, but he asked for all the
services of the Church at his funeral. LEONARDO DA VINCI</p>
<p>22 ?</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>Once he had written: “As a day well spent makes it sweet to sleep, so
a life well used makes it sweet to die.” 119</p>
<p>Vasari tell a touching story of how Leonardo died, on May 2, 1519, in
the arms of the King; but apparently Francis was elsewhere at the time.
120 The body was buried in the cloister of the Collegiate Church of
St.</p>
<p>Florentin in Amboise. Melzi wrote to Leonardo’s brothers informing
them of the event, and added: “It would be impossible for me to express
the anguish that I have suffered from this death; and while my body
holds to- gether I shall live in perpetual unhappiness. And for good
reason. The loss of such a man is mourned by all, for it is not in the
power of Nature to create anot her. May Almighty God rest his soul
forever!” 121</p>
<p>How shall we rank him? — though which of us commands the variety of
knowledge and skills required to judge so multiple a man? The
fascination of his polymorphous mind lures us into exaggerating his
actual achieve- ment; for he was more fertile in conception than in
execution. He was not the greatest scientist or engineer or painter or
sculptor or thinker of his time; he was merely the man who was all of
these together and in each field rivaled the best. There must have been
men in the medical schools who knew more of anatomy than he; the most
notable works of engineer- ing in the territory of Milan had been
accomplished before Leonardo came; both Raphael and Titian left a more
impressive total of fine paintings than has survived from Leonardo’s
brush; Michelangelo was a greater sculptor; Machiavelli and Guicciardini
were profounder minds. And yet Leonardo’s studies of the horse were
probably the best work done in the anatomy of that age; Lodovico and
Caesar Borgia chose him, from all Italy, as their engineer; nothing in
the paintings of Raphael or Titian or Michelangelo equals The Last
Supper; no painter has matched Leonardo in subtlety of nuance, or in the
delicate portrayal of feeling and thought and pensive tenderness; no
statue of the time was so highly rated as Leonardo’s plaster Sforza; no
drawing has ever surpassed The Virgin, Child, and St. Anne; and nothing
in Renaissance philosophy soared above Leonardo’s conception of natural
law.</p>
<p>He was not “the man of the Renaissance,” for he was too gentle, in -
troverted, and refined to typify an age so violent and powerful in
action and speech. He was not quite “the universal man,” since the
qualities of statesman or administrator found no place in his variety.
But, with all his limitations and incompletions, he was the fullest man
of the Renaissance, perhaps of all time. Contemplating his achievement
we marvel at the</p>

<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE SCHOOL OF LEONARDO</li>
</ol>
<p>He left behind him at Milan a bevy of younger artists who admired him
too much to be original. Four of them — Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio,
Andrea Salaino, Cesar e da Sesto, and Marco d’Oggiono— are figured in
stone at the base of the patriarchal statue of Leonardo in the Piazza
della Scala in Milan. There were others — Andrea Solari, Gaudenzio
Ferrari, Bernardino de’ Conti, Francesco Melzi. . . . All had worked in
Leonardo’s studio, and learned to imitate his grace of line without
reaching his subtlety or depth. Two other painters acknowledged him as
their teacher, though we are not sure that they knew him in the flesh.
Giovanni Antonio Bazzi, who allowed himself to come down in history
under the name of Sodoma, may have met him in Milan or Rome. Bernardino
Luini exalted sentiment, but with an engaging straightforwardness that
charms away reproach. He chose as his repeated subject the Madonna and
her Child; perhaps he rightly saw in this most hackneyed of all
pictorial themes the supreme embodiment of life as a stream of births,
of love as surmounting death, and of womanly beauty that is never mature
except in motherhood. More than any other follower of Leonardo he caught
the master’s effeminate delicacy and the tenderness — not the mystery —
of the Leonardesque smile; the Holy Family in the Ambrosiana at Milan is
a delectable variation on the Master’s Virgin, Child, and St. Anne ; and
the Sposalizio at Saronno has all the grace of Correggio. He seems never
to have doubted, as Leonardo did, the touching story of the peasant maid
who bore a god; he softened the lines and colors of his paintings with a
simple piety that Leonardo could hardly feel or rep- resent; and the
unwilling skeptic who can still respect a lovely and inspiring myth will
pause longer, in the Louvre, before Luini’s Sleep of the Infant Jesus
and Adoration of the Magi than before Leonardo’s St. John, and will find
in them a profounder satisfaction and truth.</p>
<p>With these elegant epigoni the great age of Milan died away. The</p>
<p>architects, painters, sculptors, and poets that had made Lodovico’s
court surpassingly brilliant had seldom been natives of the city, and
many of them sought other pastures when the gentle despot fell. No
outstanding talent rose in the ensuing chaos and servitude to take their
place; and a generation later the castle and the cathedral were the sole
reminders that for a mag- nificent decade — the last of the fifteenth
century — Milan had led the pageant of Italy.</p>
