<h4 id="chapter-xx-fredericks-germany">CHAPTER XX Frederick’s
Germany</h4>
<p>1756-86</p>
<p>I. FREDERICK VICTORIOUS</p>
<p>W HO was this ogre, internationally feared and admired, who had
stolen Silesia, defeated half of Europe united against him, laughed at
religion, snubbed marriage, given lessons in philosophy to Voltaire, and
torn off a limb from Poland if only to keep Russia from absorbing it
all?</p>
<p>He looked more like a ghost than an ogre when he returned, sad and
vic- torious, from the Seven Years’ War and entered Berlin (March 30,
1763) amid the plaudits of a destitute populace. “I return to a city,”
he wrote to d’Argens, “where I shall know only the walls, where I shall
find none of m y acquaintances, where an immense task awaits me, where I
shall before long leave my bones in a place of refuge troubled by
neither war nor calamities nor the villainy of man.” 1 His skin was
parched and wrinkled, his blue -gray eyes were somber and swollen, his
face was lined with battle and bitterness; only the nose had retained
its pristine majesty. He thought that he could not long survive the
drain made by the protracted war upon his resources of body, mind, and
will, but his temperate habits preserved him for twenty-three years
more. He ate and drank sparingly, and knew no luxury; he lived and
dressed in his Potsdam New Palace as if he were still in camp. He
grudged the time given to the care of his person; in his later years he
gave up shaving, merely clipping his beard now and then with scissors;
and gossip said that he did not often wash. 2</p>
<p>The war completed that hardening of his character which had begun as
a defense against his father’s cruelty. He looked on with stoic calm as
con - demned soldiers ran the gauntlet thirty-six times. 3 He harassed
his officials and generals with secret spies, sudden intrusions, abusive
language, stinted pay, and such detailed commands as stifled initiative
and interest. He never won the love of his brother Prince Henry, who
served him so effectively and loyally in diplomacy and war. He had some
women friends, but they feared rather than loved him, and none of them
was admitted to his inner circle. He respected the silent suffering of
his neglected Queen, and on his return from the war he surprised her
with a present of 25,000 thalers; but it is doubt- ful if he ever shared
her bed. She learned to love him nevertheless, seeing him heroic in
adversity and devoted in government; she spoke of him as “our dear
King,” “this dear Prince whom I love and adore.” 4 He had no children,
but he was deeply attached to his dogs; usually two of them slept in his
room at night, probably as a guard; sometimes he took one of them into
his bed to</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXwarm him with animal heat. When the last of his favorite dogs died
he “wept all day long.” 5 He was suspected of homosexuality, 6 but of
this we have only surmise.</p>
<p>Beneath his martial carapace there were elements of tenderness which
he rarely exposed to public view. He wept abundantly over the death of
his mother, and he repaid with sincere affection the devotion of his
sister Wilhel- mine. He spread little inconspicuous kindnesses among his
nieces. He laughed at Rousseau’s sentiment, but he forgave his hostility
and offered him asylum when the Christian world cast him out. He passed
from the stern drilling of his troops to blowing melodies from his
flute. He composed sonatas, con- certos, and symphonies which he shared
in performing before his court. The learned Burney heard him there, and
reported that he played with “great precision, a clean and uniform
attack, brilliant fingering, a pure and simple taste, a great neatness
of execution, and equal perfection in all his pieces”; Burney adds,
however, that “in some of the difficult passages… his Maj - esty was
obliged, against the rules, to take a breath in order to finish the
passage.” 7 * In later years his increasing shortness of breath, and the
loss of several front teeth, compelled him to give up flute playing, but
he resumed study of the clavier.</p>
<p>Next to music, his favorite diversion was philosophy. He liked to
have a philosopher or two at his table to flay the parsons and stir the
generals. He held his own in exchanges with Voltaire, and remained a
skeptic when most of the philosophes developed dogmas and fantasies. He
was the first avowedly agnostic ruler of modem times, but he made no
public attack upon religion. He thought that “we have sufficient degrees
of probability to reach the cer - tainty that post mortem nihil est ,” 9
but he rejected the determinism of d’Hol - bach, insisting (like a man
who was will incarnate) that the mind acts creatively upon sensations,
and that our impulses can, through education, be controlled by reason.
10 His favorite philosophers were “my friend Lucretius,… my good Emperor
Marcus Aurelius”; nothing of any importance, he thought, had been added
to them. 11</p>
<p>He agreed with Voltaire in believing that the “masses” bred too fast,
and worked too hard, to allow time for real education. Disillusionment
with their theology would only incline them to political violence. “The
Enlighten - ment,” said Frederick, “is a light from heaven for those who
stand on the heights, and a destructive firebrand for the masses”; 12
here was a history of the September Massacres of 1792 and the Terror of
1793 before the French Revolution had begun. And to Voltaire in Apri l,
1759: “Let us admit the truth: philosophy and the arts are diffused
amongst only a few; the great masses… remain as nature made them,
malevolent animals.” 13 He called mankind (half in humor) “ diese
verdammte Rasse ”— this damned race — and laughed at utopias of
benevolence and peace:</p>
<p>Superstition, self-interest, vengeance, treason, ingratitude, will
produce bloody and tragic scenes until the end of time, because we are
governed by</p>

<p>passions and very rarely by reason. There will always be wars,
lawsuits, devas- tations, plagues, earthquakes, bankruptcies…. Since
this is so, I presume it must be necessary…. But it seems to me that if
this universe had been made by a benevolent being, he should have made
us happier than we are…. The human mind is weak; more than three fourths
of mankind are made for sub- jection to the most absurd fanaticism. Fear
of the Devil and of hell fascinates their eyes, and they detest the wise
man who tries to enlighten them…. In vain do I seek in them that image
of God which the theologians assert they bear upon them. Every man has a
wild beast in him; few can restrain it; most men let loose the bridle
when not restrained by terror of the law. 14</p>
<p>Frederick concluded that to allow governments to be dominated by the
majority would be disastrous. A democracy, to survive, must be, like
other governments, a minority persuading a majority to let itself be led
by a minor- ity. Frederick thought like Napoleon that “among nations and
in revolutions aristocracy always exists.” 15 He believed that an
hereditary aristocracy would</p>
<p>Frederick liked to picture himself as the servant of the state and
the people. This may have been a rationalization of his will to power,
but he lived up to the claim. The state became for him the Supreme
Being, to which he would sacrifice himself and others; and the demands
of that service overrode, in his view, the code of individual morality;
the Ten Commandments stop at the royal doors. All governments agreed
with this Realpolitik , and some mon- archs accepted the view of
kingship as a sacred service. Frederick had the latter notion through
contact with Voltaire; and through contact with Fred- erick the
philosophes developed their these royale — that the best hope for reform
and progress lay in the enlightenment of kings.</p>
<p>So, despite his wars, he became the idol of the French philosophers,
and softened the hostility even of the virtuous Rousseau. D’Alembert
long re - fused Frederick’s invitations, but did not withhold his
praise. “The philoso - phers and men of letters in every land,” he wrote
to Frederick, “have long lo oked upon you, Sire, as their leader and
their model.” 17 The cautious math - ematician at last succumbed to
repeated calls, and spent two months with Frederick at Potsdam in 1763.
Intimacy (and a pension) did not diminish d’Alembert’s admiration. He
was delighted with the King’s disregard of eti - quette, and with his
remarks — not only on war and government, but also on literature and
philosophy; this, he told Julie de Lespinasse, was finer converse than
one could then hear in France. 18 When, in 1776, d’Alembert was deso -
late over Julie’s death, Frederick sent him a letter which shows the
ogre in a wise and tender vein:</p>
<p>I am sorry for the misfortune which has befallen you…. The wounds of
the heart are the most sensitive of all, and… nothing but time can heal
them…. I have, to my misery, had only too much experience of the
suffering</p>
<p>49^ ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXcaused by such losses. The best remedy is to put compulsion upon
oneself in order to divert one’s mind…. You should choose some
geometrical in - vestigation which demands constant application….
Cicero, to console him- self for the death of his dear Tullia, threw
himself into composition…. At your age and mine we should be the more
readily consoled because we shall not long delay to join the objects of
our regrets. 19</p>
<p>He urged d’Alembert to come again to Potsdam. “We will philosophize
to - gether concerning the nothingness of life,… concerning the vanity
of stoicism…. I will feel as happy in allaying your grief as if I had
won a battle.” Here was, if not quite a philosopher king, at least a
king who loved philosophers.</p>
<p>This no longer applied to Voltaire. Their quarrels in Berlin and
Potsdam, and the arrest of Voltaire in Frankfurt, had left wounds deeper
than grief. The philosopher remained bitter longer than the King. He
told the Prince de Ligne that Frederick was “incapable of gratitude, and
never had any except for the horse on which he ran away at the battle of
Mollwitz.” 20 The corre - spondence between these two most brilliant men
of the century reopened when Voltaire wrote to dissuade the desperate
warrior from suicide. Soon they were exchanging reproaches and
compliments. Voltaire reminded Fred- erick of the indignities which the
philosopher and his niece had suffered at the hands of the King’s
agents; Frederick answered: “If you had not had to do with a man madly
enamored of your fine genius, you would not have gotten off so well….
Consider all that as done with, and never let me hear again of that
wearisome niece.” 21 But then the King stroked the philosophic ego
bewitchingly:</p>
<p>Do you want sweet things? Very good; I will tell you some truths. I
esteem in you the finest genius that the ages have borne; I admire your
poetry, I love your prose…. Never has an author before you had a touch
so keen, a taste so sure and delicate…. You are charming in
conversation; you know how to amuse and instruct at the same time. You
are the most seductive being that I know…. All depends for a man upon
the time when he comes into the world. Though I came too late, I do not
regret it, for 7 have seen Voltaire ,… and he writes to me. 22</p>
<p>The K ing supported with substantial contributions Voltaire’s
campaigns for the Calas and the Sirvens, and applauded the war against
Pinfame , but he did not share the philosophes ’ trust in the
enlightenment of mankind. In the race between reason and superstition he
predicted the victory of superstition. So, to Voltaire, September 13,
1766:</p>
<p>Your missionaries will open the eyes of a few young people…. But how
many fools there are in the world who do not think!… Believe me, if the
philosophers founded a government, within half a century the people
would create new superstitions…. The object of adoration may change,
like your French fashions; [but] what does it matter whether people
prostrate them- selves before a piece of unleavened bread, before the ox
Apis, before the Ark of the Covenant, or before a statue? The choice is
not worth the trouble; the superstition is the same, and reason gains
nothing. 23</p>
<p>Having accepted religion as a human need, Frederick made his peace
with it, and protected all its peaceful forms with full toleration. In

<p>Silesia he left Catholicism undisturbed, except that he opened to all
faiths the University of Breslau, which had previously admitted only
Catholics. He welcomed, as valuable teachers, the Jesuits who, expelled
by Catholic kings, sought refuge under his agnostic rule. He protected
as well Mohammedans, Jews, and atheists; and in his reign and realm Kant
practiced that freedom of speech and teaching and writing which was so
sharply rebuked and ended after Frederick’s death. Under this toleration
most forms of religion declined in Prussia. In 1780 there was one
ecclesiastic per thousand population in Ber- lin; in Munich there were
thirty. 24 Frederick thought that toleration would soon put an end to
Catholicism. “It will take a miracle to restore the Catholic Church,” he
wrote to Voltaire in 1767; “it has been struck by a terrible apoplexy;
and you will yet have the consolation of burying it and writing its
epitaph.” 25 The most thorough of skeptics had forgotten for a moment to
be skeptical of skepticism.</p>

<li>REBUILDING PRUSSIA</li>
</ol>
<p>No ruler in history ever worked so hard at his trade, except perhaps
his pupil Joseph II of Austria. Frederick disciplined himself as he did
his troops, rising usually at five, sometimes at four, working till
seven, breakfasting, con- ferring with his aides till eleven, reviewing
his palace guard, dining at twelve- thirty with ministers and
ambassadors, working till five, and only then relaxing into music,
literature, and conversation. The “midnight” suppers, after the war,
began at half past nine, and were over at twelve. He allowed no family
ties to distract him, no court ceremonies to burden him, no religious
holidays to interrupt his toil. He watched the work of his ministers,
dictated almost every move of policy, kept an eye on the treasury; and
over all the government he established a Fiscal, or bureau of accounts,
empowered to examine any department at any time, and instructed to
report any suspicion of irregularity. He punished malfeasance or
incompetence so rigorously that official corruption, which flourished
everywhere else in Europe, almost dis- appeared from Prussia.</p>
<p>He prided himself on this, and on the rapid recovery of his
devastated country. He began with domestic economies that earned him
gibes from the extravagant courts of defeated Austria and France. The
royal household was as frugally managed as a tradesman’s home. His
wardrobe was a soldier’s uni - form, three old coats, waistcoats soiled
with snuff, and one ceremonial robe that lasted him all his life. He
dismissed his father’s retinue of huntsmen and hunting dogs; this
warrior preferred poetry to the hunt. He built no navy, sought no
colonies. His bureaucrats were poorly paid, and he provided with like
parsimony for the modest court that he maintained at Berlin — while he
stayed in Potsdam. Yet the Earl of Chesterfield judged it “the politest,
the most shining, the most useful court in Europe for a young fellow to
be at,” and added, “You will see the arts and wisdom of government
better in that</p>
<p>500 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXview to consoling London, reported that there was “in that capital
[Berlin] neither an honest man nor a chaste woman.” 27</p>
<p>Frederick checked his parsimony when national defense was concerned.
By persuasion and conscription he soon restored his army to its prewar
strength; only with that weapon in hand could he maintain the
territorial integrity of Prussia against the ambitions of Joseph II and
Catherine II. That army, too, had to buttress the laws that gave order
and stability to Prussian life. Organized central force, he felt, was
the only alternative to disorganized and disruptive force in private
hands. He hoped that obedience through fear of force would grow into
obedience through habituation to law — which was force reduced to rules
and hiding its claws.</p>
<p>He renewed his behest to jurists to codify into one system of law —
an “Allgemeine Preussische Landrecht”— the divers and contradictory
legisla- tion of many provinces and generations; this task, interrupted
by the death of Samuel von Cocceji (1755) and by the war, was resumed by
Chancellor Johann von Carmer and Privy Councilor K. G. Svarez, and was
completed in 1791. The new code took feudalism and serfdom for granted,
but within those limitations it sought to protect the individual against
private or public oppression or injustice. It abolished superfluous
courts, reduced and quick- ened legal procedure, moderated penalties,
and raised the requirements for appointment to magistracies. No sentence
of death could be executed without sanction by the king, and appeal to
the king was open to all. He won a repu- tation for impartial justice,
and Prussian courts were soon acknowledged to be the most honest and
efficient in Europe. 28</p>
<p>In 1763 Frederick issued a “Generallandschulreglement” confirming and
extending the compulsory education proclaimed by his father in 1716-17.
Every child in Prussia, from his fifth to his fourteenth year, was to
attend school. It was characteristic of Frederick that Latin was dropped
from the elementary curriculum, that old soldiers were appointed as
schoolmasters, and that most learning was by semimilitary drill. 29 The
King added: “It is a good thing that the schoolmasters in the country
teach the youngsters religion and morals…. It is enough for the people
in the country to learn only a little reading and writing…. Instruction
must be planned… to keep them in the villages and not to influence them
to leave.” 30</p>
<p>Economic reconstruction received priority in time and money. Using at
first the funds that had been collected for another, now unneeded,
campaign, Frederick financed the rebuilding of towns and villages, the
distribution of food to hungry communities, the provision of seed for
new sowings; he dis- persed among the farms sixty thousand horses that
could be spared from the army. Altogether 20,389,000 thalers were spent
in public relief. 31 War- ravaged Silesia was excused from taxes for six
months; eight thousand houses were built there in three years; a land
bank advanced money to Silesian farm- ers on easy terms. Credit
societies were established at various centers to en- courage
agricultural expansion. The marshy area along the lower Oder was
drained, providing cultivatable land for fifty thousand men. Agents were
sent abroad to invite immigrants; 300,000 came. 32</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>501</p>
<p>As serfdom bound the peasant to his lord, there was not in Prussia
that freedom to move to the towns which, in England, made possible the
rapid development of industry. Frederick worked in a hundred ways to
overcome this handicap. He lent money on easy terms to entrepreneurs; he
permitted temporary monopolies; he imported workmen; he opened technical
schools; he set up a porcelain factory in Berlin. He strove to establish
a silk industry, but the mulberry trees languished in the northern cold.
He promoted vigor- ous mining in Silesia, which was rich in minerals. On
September 5, 1777, he wrote to Voltaire as one businessman to another:
“I am returning from Silesia, with which I am well content…. We have
sold to foreigners</p>
<p>5,000,000 crowns’ worth of linen, 1,200,000 crowns’ worth of cloth….
A much simpler process than that of Reaumur has been discovered for
making iron into steel.” 33</p>
<p>To facilitate trade the King abolished internal tolls, widened
harbors, dug canals, and built thirty thousand miles of new roads.
Foreign trade was held back by high duties on imports and by embargoes
on the export of strategic goods; international chaos compelled the
protection of home industry to en- sure industrial adequacy in war.
Nevertheless Berlin grew as the hub of trade as well as government: in
1721 it had 60,000 population; in 1777 it had 140, ooo; 34 it was
preparing to be the capital of Germany.</p>
<p>To finance this amalgam of feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and
autocracy Frederick drew from his people in taxation almost as much as
he returned to them in social order, subsidies, and public works. He
kept for the state a monopoly on salt, sugar, tobacco, and (after 1781)
coffee, and he owned a third of the arable land. 35 He taxed everything,
even street singers, and brought in Helvetius to devise an inescapable
system of taxgathering. “The new projects of excise [taxation ],” wrote
an English ambassador, “have really alienated t he affections of the
people from their sovereign.” 36 At his death Frederick left in the
treasury 51,000,000 thalers — two and a half times the annual revenue of
the state.</p>

a devas- tating analysis De la Monarchie prussienne sous Frederic le
Grand. Inheriting from his father the free-enterprise principles of the
physiocrats, he con- demned the Frederician regime as a police state, a
bureaucracy choking all initiative and invading every privacy. Frederick
might have replied that in the chaotic condition of Prussia after the
Seven Years’ War laissez -faire would have annulled his victory with
economic anarchy. Direction was im- perative; he was the only one who
could effectively command; and he knew no other form of command than
that of a general to his troops. He saved Prussia from defeat and
collapse, and paid by losing the love of his people. He realized this
result, and comforted himself with righteousness:</p>
<p>Mankind move if you urge them on, and stop as soon as you leave off
driving them…. Men read little, and have no desire to learn how anything
can be managed differently. As for me, who never did them anything but
good, they think that I want to put a knife to their throats, so soon as
there is any ques- tion of introducing a useful improvement, or, indeed,
any change at all. In</p>

<p>His will prevailed. Prussia, even in his lifetime, grew rich and
strong. Popu- lation doubled, education spread, religious intolerance
hid its head. It is true that this new order depended upon enlightened
despotism, and that when, after Frederick’s death, the despotism
remained without the enlightenment, the national structure was weakened
and collapsed at Jena before a will as strong as Frederick’s own. But
the Napoleonic edif ice too, depending upon one will and brain,
collapsed; and in the long run it was Frederick’s distant heir and
beneficiary Bismarck who chastened the France of Napoleon’s heir, and
made from Prussia and a hundred principalities a united and powerful
Germany.</p>

<li>THE PRINCIPALITIES</li>
</ol>
<p>We remind ourselves again that in the eighteenth century Germany was
not a nation but a loose federation of nearly independent states, which
for- mally accepted the “Holy Roman” emperor at Vienna as their head,
and sen t representatives occasionally to a Reichstag, or Imperial Diet,
whose chief functions were to hear speeches, suffer ceremonies, and
elect an emperor. The states had a common language, literature, and art,
but differed in manners, dress, coinage, and creed. There were some
advantages in this political frag- mentation: the multiplicity of
princely courts favored a stimulating diversity of cultures; the armies
were small, instead of being united for the terror of Europe; and a
considerable degree of tolerance in religion, custom, and law was forced
upon state, church, and people by the ease of emigration. Theo-
retically the power of each prince was absolute, for the Protestant
faith sanc- tioned the “divine right of kings.” Frederick, who
recognized no divine right but that of his army, satirized “most small
princes, particularly German ones,” who “ruin themselves by reckless
extravagance, misled by the illusion of their imagined greatness…. The
youngest son of the youngest son of an appanaged dynasty imagines he is
of the same stamp as Louis XIV. He builds his Versailles, keeps
mistresses, and has an army… strong enough to fight… a battle on the
stage of Verona.” 88</p>
<p>The most important of the principalities was Saxony. Its age of art
and glory ended when Elector Frederick Augustus II allied himself with
Maria Theresa against Frederick the Great; the merciless King bombarded
and ruined Dresden in 1760; the Elector fled to Poland as its Augustus
III, and died in 1763. His grandson Frederick Augustus III inherited the
electorate at the age of thirteen, earned the name of “Der Gerechte”
(The Just) , made Saxony a kingdom ( 1 806) , and through many
vicissitudes kept his throne till his death (1827).</p>
<p>Karl Eugen, duke of Wiirttemberg, comes into our story chiefly as the
friend and enemy of Schiller. He taxed his subjects with inexhaustible
in- genuity, sold ten thousand of his troops to France, and maintained
what Casa-</p>
<p>chap. xx ) Frede rick’s Germany 503</p>
<p>nova thought “the most brilliant court in Europe,” 39 with a French
theater,</p>
<p>Class distinctions, however, were emphasized in most of the German
states, as part of the technique of social control. Nobles, clergy, army
officers, pro- fessional men, merchants, and peasants constituted
separate classes; and within every category there were grades each of
which stiffened itself with scorn of the next beneath. Marriage outside
one’s class was almost unthink - able, but some merchants and financiers
bought nobility. The nobles held a monopoly of the higher posts in the
army and the government, and many of them earned their privileges by
bravery or competence; but many were para- sites, composed of uniforms,
competing for social precedence at the court, and following French
fashions in language, philosophy, and mistresses. It is to the credit of
the princes, prelates, and nobles of western Germany that by 1780 they
had freed their peasants from serfdom, and on terms that made possible a
wide spread of rural prosperity. Reinhold Lenz thought the peasants
finer human beings — simpler, heartier, more elemental — than the
penny-counting tradesmen or the prancing young aristocrats. 41 Heinrich
Jung’s autobiography (1777) idealized village life in its daily labor as
well as its seasonal festivals; Herder found the folk songs of the
peasantry to be truer and profounder than the poetry of the books; and
Goethe, in his Dichtung und Wahrheit, described the vintage celebration
as “pervading a whole dis - trict with jubilation,” fireworks, song, and
wine. 42 This was one side of the German scene; the other was hard
labor, high taxes, women old at thirty, illiterate children dressed in
rags and begging in the streets. “At one station,” Eva Konig told
Lessing in 1770, “there crowded around me… eighty beggars;… in Munich
whole families ran after me, exclaiming that surely one would not let
them starve.” 43</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century the family was more important than the
state or the school. The German home was the source and center of moral
disci- pline, social order, and economic activity. There the child
learned to obey a stern father, take refuge with a loving mother, and
share at an early age in the diverse and formative tasks that filled the
day. Schiller’s “Song of the Bell” gave an ideal picture of “the
housewife so modest,… wisely govern - ing the circle of the family,
training the girls, restraining the boys, and using all spare moments to
ply the loom.” 44 The wife was subject to the husband,</p>
<p>504 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXbut she was the idol of her children. Outside the home, except at
the courts, men usually excluded women from their social life, and so
their conversation tended to be either dull or profane. At the courts
there were many women of culture and fine manners; some, Eckermann
thought, “write an excellent style, and surpass, in that respect, many
of our most celebrated authors.” 45 As in France, so in Germany, the
women of the upper classes had to learn swooning as part of their
technique, and a readiness for sentiment melting into tears.</p>
<p>Court morals followed French models in drinking, gambling, adultery,
and divorce. Titled ladies, according to Mme. de Stael, changed husbands
“with as little difficulty as if they were arrangi ng the incidents of a
drama,” and with “little bitterness of spirit.” 48 The princes set the
pace for immorality by selling their soldiers to foreign rulers; so the
Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel built an elegant palace, and maintained a
sumptuous court, from the proceeds of his Soldatenhandel — commerce in
soldiery. Altogether, during the American Revolution, German princes
sold — or, as they put it, “lent”— thirty thousand troops to England for
some £ 500,000; 12,500 of these men never returned. 47 Outside of
Prussia the Germans of the eighteenth century — recalling the hor- rors
of the seventeenth — showed little inclination to war. Apparently “na -
tional character” can change from one century to another.</p>
<p>Religion in Germany was more subordinate to the state than in
Catholic lands. Divided into sects, it had no awesome pontiff to
co-ordinate its doc- trine, strategy and defense; its leaders were
appointed by the prince, its in- come depended upon his will. In the
middle and lower classes it was a strong faith; only the nobles, the
intellectuals, and a few clergymen were affected by the waves of
unbelief that swept in from England and France. The Rhine region was
mostly Catholic, but it was there that this period saw the rise of a
movement boldly challenging the authority of the popes.</p>
<p>In 1763 Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim, auxiliary bishop of Trier, pub-
lished, under the pseudonym Justinus Febronius, a treatise De Statu Ec-
clesiae et legitima Potestate r omani Pontificis (On the State of the
Church, and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff ). The book was
translated into German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, and
made a stir throughout Western Europe. “Febronius” accepted the primacy
of the pope, but only as one of honor and executive administration; the
pope is not in- fallible; appeal should be possible from his decision to
a general council, which should have the ultimate legislative authority
in the Church. The author distrusted the secret conservative influence
of the Roman Curia, and suggested that the excessive centralization of
ecclesiastical power had pro- duced the Reformation; decentralization
might ease the return of Protestants to the Catholic Church. In matters
of human, not divine, law secular princes were entitled to refuse
obedience to the papacy; if necessary, they might rightfully separate
their national churches from Rome. The Pope condemned the book
(February, 1764), but it bec ame “the breviary of the govern - ments.”
48 We have seen its influence on Joseph II.</p>
<p>The archbishops of Cologne, Trier, Mainz, and Salzburg favored the
views</p>

<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5°5</p>
<p>of “Febronius”; they wished to be independent of the pope as the
other prin - cipalities were of the emperor. On September 25, 1786, they
issued the “Punctation [preliminary statement] of Ems” (near Coblenz),
which, if it had been put into effect, would have created a new
Reformation:</p>
<p>The pope is and remains the highest authority in the Church,… but
those [papal] privileges which do not spring from the first Christian
centuries but are based on the false Isadoran Decretals, and are
disadvantageous to the bishops,… can no longer be considered valid; they
belong among the usurpations of the Roman Curia; and the bishops are
entitled (since peaceful protests are of no avail) themselves to
maintain their lawful rights under the protection of the Roman-German
Emperor. There should no longer be any appeals [from the bishops] to
Rome…. The [religious] orders should take no directions from foreign
superiors, nor attend general councils outside Germany. No contribu-
tions should be sent to Rome…. Vacant benefices should be filled not by
Rome but by a regular election of native candidates…. A German national
council should regulate these and other matters. 49</p>
<p>The German bishops, fearing the financial power of the Curia, gave no
sup- port to this declaration; moreover, they hesitated to replace the
distant over- lordship of Rome with the immediate and less evadable
authority of the German princes. The incipient revolt collapsed;
Hontheim retracted (1788); the archbishops withdre w their “punctation”
(1789), and all was as before. IV. THE GERMAN ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p>Not quite. Education, except in the ecclesiastical principalities,
had passed from church to state control. University professors were
appointed and paid (with shameful parsimony) by the government, and held
the status of public officials. Although all teachers and students were
required to subscribe to the religion of the prince, the faculties,
until 1789, enjoyed a growing measure of academic freedom. German
replaced Latin as the language of instruction. Courses in science and
philosophy multiplied, and philosophy was spaciously defined (at the
University of Konigsberg in Kant’s day) as “the ability to think, and to
investigate the nature of things without prejudices or sectarian- ism.”
50 Karl von Zedlitz, the devoted Minister of Education under
Frederick</p>
<p>Many poor students obtained public or private aid for a university
educa- tion; pleasant is Eckermann’s story of how he was helped by kind
neighbors at every step of his development. 52 There were no class
distinctions in the student body. 53 Any graduate was allowed to lecture
under university aus- pices, for whatever fees he could collect from his
auditors; Kant began his professorial career in this way; and such
competition from new teachers kept</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXold pundits on their toes. Mme. de Stael judged the twenty-four
German universities to be “the most learned in Europe. In no country,
not even Eng - land, are there so many means of instruction, or of
bringing one’s capacities to perfection…. Since the Reformation the
Protestant universities have been incontestably superior to the
Catholic; and the literary glory of Ger- many depends upon these
institutions.” 54</p>
<p>Educational reform was in the air. Johann Basedow, inspired by
reading Rousseau, issued in 1774 a four-volume Elementarwerke, which
outlined a plan for teaching children through direct acquaintance with
nature. They were to acquire health and vigor through games and physical
exercises; they were to receive much of their instruction outdoors
instead of being tied to desks; they were to learn languages not through
grammar and rote but through naming objects and actions encountered in
the day’s experience; they were to learn morals by forming and
regulating their own social groups; and they were to prepare for life by
learning a trade. Religion was to enter into the curriculum, but not as
pervasively as before; Basedow openly doubted the Trinity. 55 He
established at Dessau (1774) a sample Philan- thropinum, which produced
pupils who se “sauciness and pertness, omnis - cience and arrogance” 58
scandalized their elders; but this “progressive educa - tion” harmonized
with the Enlightenment, and spread rapidly throughout Germany.</p>
<p>Experiments in education were part of the intellectual ferment that
agitated the country between the Seven Years’ War and the French
Revolution. Books, newspapers, magazines, circulating libraries, reading
clubs, multiplied enthusiastically. A dozen literary movements sprouted,
each with its ideol- ogy, journal, and protagonists. The firstGerman
daily, Die LeipzigerZeitung, had begun in 1660; by 1784 there were 217
daily or weekly newspapers in Germany. In 1751 Lessing began to edit the
literary section of the Vossische Zeitung in Berlin; in 1772 Merck,
Goethe, and Herder issued Die Frankfur- ter gelehrte Anzeigen, or
Frankfurt Literary News; in 1773-89 Wieland made Der teutsche Merkur the
most influential literary review in Germany. There were three thousand
German authors in 1773, six thousand in 1787; Leipzig alone had 133.
Many of these were part-time writers; Lessing was probably the first
German who, through many years, made a living by litera- ture. Almost
all authors were poor, for copyright protected them only in their own
principality; pirated editions severely limited the earnings of au- thor
and publisher alike. Goethe lost money on Gotz von Berlichingen, and
made little on Werther, the greatest literary success of that
generation.</p>
<p>The outburst of German literature is among the major events of the
second half of the eighteenth century. D’Alembert, writing from Potsdam
in 1763, found nothing worthy of report in German publications; 57 by
1790 Germany rivaled, perhaps surpassed, France in contemporary literary
genius. We have noted Frederick’s scorn of the German language as
raucous and coarse and poisoned with consonants; yet Frederick himself,
by his dramatic repulse of so many enemies, inspired Germany with a
national pride that encouraged German writers to use their own language
and stand up before the Voltaires</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5°7</p>
<p>and the Rousseaus. By 1763 German had refined itself into a literary
lan- guage, and was ready to voice the German Enlightenment.</p>
<p>This Aufklarung was no virgin birth. It was the painful product of
English deism coupled with French free thought on the ground prepared by
the moderate rationalism of Christian von Wolff. The major deistic
blasts of Toland, Tindal, Collins, Whiston, and Woolston had by 1743
been translated into German, and by 1755 Grimm’s Correspondance was
disseminating the latest French ideas among the German elite. Already in
1756 there were enough freethinkers in Germany to allow the publication
of a Freidenker- lexikon. In 1763-64 Basedow issued his Philalethie (
Love of Truth), which rejected any divine revelation other than that of
nature itself. In 1759 Chris- toph Friedrich Nikolai, a Berlin
bookseller, began Brief e die neueste Liter atur betreffend; enriched
with articles by Lessing, Herder, and Moses Mendels- sohn, these Letters
concerning the Latest Literature continued till 1765 to be a literary
beacon of the Aufklarung, warring against extravagance in liter- ature
and authority in religion.</p>
<p>Freemasonry shared in the movement. The first lodge of Freimaurer was
founded at Hamburg in 1733; other lodges followed; members included
Frederick the Great, Dukes Ferdinand of Brunswick and Karl August of
Saxe- Weimar, Lessing, Wieland, Herder, Klopstock, Goethe, Kleist. Gen-
erally these groups favored deism, but avoided open criticism of
orthodox belief. In 1776 Adam Weishaupt, professor of canon law at
Ingolstadt, organ- ized a kindred secret society, which he called
Perfektibilisten, but which later took on the old name of Illuminati.
Its ex-Jesuit founder, following the model of the Society of Jesus,
divided its associates into grades of initiation, and pledged them to
obey their leaders in a campaign to “unite all men capable of
independent thought,” make man “a masterpiece of reason, and thus
attain</p>
<p>Even the clergy were touched by the “Clearing Up.” Johann Semler, pro
- fessor of theology at Halle, applied higher criticism to the Bible: he
argued (precisely contrary to Bishop Warburton) that the Old Testament
could not be inspired by God, since, except in its final phase, it
ignored immortal- ity; he suggested that Christianity had been deflected
from the teachings of Christ by the theology of St. Paul, who had never
seen Christ; and he advised theologians to consider Christianity as a
transient form of the effort of man to achieve a moral life. When Karl
Bahrdt and others of his pupils rejected all of Christian dogma except
belief in God, Semler returned to orthodoxy, and held his chair of
theology from 1752 to 1791. Bahrdt described Jesus as simply a great
teacher, “like Moses, Confucius, Socrates, Semler, Luther, and myself.”
59 Johann Eberhard also equated Socrates with Christ; he was ex - pelled
from the Lutheran ministry, but Frederick made him professor of
philosophy at Halle. Another clergyman, W. A. Teller, reduced
Christianity to deism, and invited into his congregation anyone,
including Jews, who be- lieved in God. 60 Johann Schulz, a Lutheran
pastor, denied the divinity of</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXJesus, and reduced God to the “sufficient ground of the world”; 81
he was dis - missed from the ministry in 1792.</p>
<p>These vocal heretics were a small minority; perhaps silent heretics
were many. Because so many clergymen offered a welcome to reason,
because religion was much stronger in Germany than in England or France,
and be- cause the philosophy of Wolff had provided the universities with
a com- promise between rationalism and religion, the German
Enlightenment did not take an extreme form. It sought not to destroy
religion, but to free it from the myths, absurdities, and sacerdotalism
that in France made Catholicism so pleasing to the people and so
irritating to the philosophers. Following Rous- seau rather than
Voltaire, German rationalists recognized the profound ap- peal that
religion makes to the emotional elements in man; and the German
nobility, less openly skeptical than the French, supported religion as
an aid to morals and government. The Romantic movement checked the
advance •;f rationalism, and prevented Lessing from being to Ger many
what Voltaire had been to France.</p>
<p>V. GOTTHOLD LESSING: 1 7 29-8 I</p>
<p>His great-grandfather was burgomaster of a small town in Saxony; his
grandfather was for twenty-four years burgomaster of Kamenz, and wrote a
plea for religious toleration; his father was the head Lutheran pastor
in Kamenz, and wrote a catechism which Lessing learned by heart. His
mother was the daughter of the preacher to whose pastorate his father
had succeeded. It was natural for her to intend him for the ministry,
and for him, sated with piety, to rebel.</p>
<p>His early education, at home and in a grammar school at Meissen, was
a mixture of German discipline and classic literature, of Lutheran
theology and Latin comedy. “Theophrastus, Plautus, and Terence were my
world, whic h I studied with delight.” 62 At seventeen he was sent to
Leipzig on a scholar - ship. He found the town more interesting than the
university; he sowed some wild oats, fell in love with the theater and
an actress, was allowed behind the scenes, learned the machinery of the
stage. At nineteen he wrote a play, and managed to get it produced.
Hearing of this sin, the mother wept, the father angrily summoned him
home. He smiled them out of their grief, and talked them into paying his
debts. His sister, coming upon his poems, found them wondrously
improper, and burned them; he threw snow into her bosom to cool her
zeal. He was sent back to Leipzig to study philosophy and become a
professor; he found philosophy deadly, incurred incurable debts, and
fled to Berlin (1748).</p>
<p>There he lived as a literary journeyman, writing reviews, making
transla- tions, and joining with Christlob Mylius in editing a
short-lived magazine of the theater. By the age of nineteen he was an
addict of free thought. He read Spinoza and found him, despite geometry,
irresistible. He composed a drama (1749?), Der Freigeist ( The Free
Spirit ); it contrasted Theophan, a kindly</p>

<p>young clergyman, with Adrast, a harsh and raucous freethinker and
some- thing of a rogue; here Christianity had much the better of the
argument. But about this time Lessing wrote to his father: “The
Christian faith is not some - thing which one should accept on trust fr
om one’s parents.” 63 Now he com - posed another play, Die Juden,
discussing the intermarriage of Christian and Jew: a rich and honorable
Hebrew, named simply “The Traveler,” saves the</p>
<p>Early in 1751 Voltaire, or his secretary, engaged Lessing to
translate into German some material which the expatriate philosopher
wished to use in a suit against Abraham Hirsch. The secretary allowed
Lessing to borrow part of a manuscript of Voltaire’s Le Siecle de Louis
XIV. Later in that year Les - sing went to Wittenberg, and took the
manuscript with him. Fearing that this uncorrected copy might be used
for a pirated edition, Voltaire sent Lessing a politely urgent request
for the return of the sheets. Lessing com- plied, but resented the
urgent tone; and this may have colored his subsequent hostility to
Voltaire’s works and character.</p>
<p>Lessing received the master’s degree at the University of Wittenberg
in</p>
<ol start="1752" type="1">
<li>Back in Berlin, he contributed to various periodicals articles of
such positive thought and pungent style that by 1753 he had won an
audience large enough to pardon his publishing, at the age of
twenty-four, a six- volume collected edition of his work. These included
a new play, Miss Sara Sampson, which was a milestone in the history of
the German stage. Till this time the German theater had presented native
comedies, but rarely a native tragedy. Lessing urged his fellow
playwrights to turn from French to Eng- lish models, and to write their
own tragic dramas. He praised Diderot for defending the comedy of
sentiment and the middle-class tragedy, but it was from England — from
George Lillo’s The London Merchant (1731) and Sam - uel Richardson’s
Clarissa (1748)— that he took his inspiration for Miss Sara
Sampson.</li>
</ol>
<p>The play was performed at Frankfurt-an-der-Oder in 1755, and was well
received. It had all the elements of drama: it began with a seduction,
ended with a suicide, and connected them with a river of tears. The
villain Mellefont (Honeyface) is Richardson’s Lovelace; he is a hardened
hand at defloration, but deprecates monogamy; he promises marriage to
Sara, elopes with her, sleeps with her, then postpones marriage; a
former mistress tries to win him back, fails, poisons Sara; Sara’s
father arrives, ready to forgive everyth ing and accept Mellefont as his
son, only to find his daughter dying; Mellefont, quite out of character,
kills himself, as if to exemplify Lessing’s quip that in tragic dramas
the protagonists die of nothing but the fifth act. 64</p>
<p>He thought that now he could butter his bread by writing for the
stage; and as Berlin had no theater he moved to Leipzig (1755). Then the
Seven</p>
<p>510 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXYears’ War broke out, the theater was closed, the book trade
languished, Lessing was pe nniless. He moved back to Berlin, and
contributed to Nikolai’s Brief e die neueste Literatur betreffend
articles that marked a new height in German literary criticism. “Rules,”
said his Letter xix, “are what the masters</p>
<p>Laokoon, oder Vber die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie ( Laocoon , or
On the Boundaries between Painting and Poetry) derived its immediate
stimulus from Winckelmann’s Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in
Painting and Sculpture (1755). When Lessing had written half of his
manuscript Winckelmann’s History of Ancient Art (1764) reached him; he
interrupted his essay and wrote: u The History of Art by Herr
Winckelmann has ap- peared. I will not venture a step further without
having read this work.” 65 He took as his starting point Winckelmann’s
conception of classic Greek art as characterized by serene dignity and
grandeur, and he accepted Winckel- mann’s claim that the Laocoon
statuary group in the Vatican Gallery pre - served these qualities
despite mortal pain. (Laocoon, priest of Apollo at Troy, suspected that
there were Greeks in the “Trojan horse,” and hurle d a spear at it; the
goddess Athena, favoring the Greeks, persuaded Poseidon to send up from
the sea two huge serpents that twined themselves murderously around the
priest and his two sons.) Winckelmann supposed that the Lao- coon — now
reckoned as a work of Rhodian sculptors in the last century be- fore
Christ — belonged to the classic age of Pheidias. Why Winckelmann, who
had seen and studied the work, ascribed calm grandeur to the distorted
features of the priest is a mystery; Lessing accepted the description
because he had never seen the statue. 66 He agreed that the sculptor had
moderated the expression of pain; he proceeded to inquire into the
reason for this artistic restraint; and he proposed to derive it from
the inherent and proper limita- tions of plastic art.</p>
<p>He quoted the dictum of the Greek poet Simonides that “painting is
silent poetry, and poetry is eloquent painting.” 67 But, he added, the
two must keep within their natural bounds: painting and sculpture should
describe objects in space, and not try to tell a story; poetry should
narrate events in time, and not try to describe objects in space.
Detailed description should be left to the plastic arts; when it occurs
in poetry, as in Thomson’s The Seasons or Haller’s Die Alpen, it
interrupts the narrative and obscures the events. “To oppose this false
taste, and to counteract these unfounded opinions, is the principal
object of the following observations.” 68 Lessing soon forgot this
purpose, and lost himself in a detailed di scussion of Winckelmann’s
History. Here he was without experience or competence, and his
exaltation of ideal beauty as the object of art had a sterilizing effect
upon German painting. He confused painting with sculpture, applying to
both of them the norms proper chiefly to sculpture, and so encouraging
the cold formality of Anton Raphael Mengs.</p>

<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5 ”</p>
<p>But his influence on German poetry was a blessing; he freed it from
long de- scriptions, scholastic didacticism, and tedious detail, and
guided it to action and feeling. Goethe gratefully acknowledged the
liberating effect of the Laocodn.</p>
<p>Lessing found himself more at home when (April, 1767) he moved to
Hamburg as playwright and dramatic critic at eight hundred thalers per
year. There he produced his new play, Minna von Barnhelm. Its hero,
Major Tellheim, returning with honors from the war to his estates, wins
betrothal to the wealthy and lovely Minna. A turn of fortune and hostile
intrigues reduce him to poverty; he withdraws from his engagement as
being no longer a fit husband for the heiress to a great fortune. He
disappears; she pursues him and begs him to marry her; he refuses.
Perceiving his reason, she con- trives a hoax whereby she becomes
attractively penniless; now the major offers himself as a mate. Suddenly
two messengers enter, one announcing that Minna, the other that
Tellheim, has been restored to affluence. Everybody rejoices, and even
the servants are precipitated into marriage. The dialogue is sprightly,
the characters are improbable, the plot is absurd — but nearly all plots
are absurd.</p>
<p>On the same day (April 22, 1767) that saw the opening of the National
Theater at Hamburg Lessing issued the prospectus of his Hamburgische
Dramaturgic. Periodically, in the next two years, these essays commented
on the plays produced in Germany, and on the theory of drama in the
philoso- phers. He agreed with Aristotle in judging drama to be the
highest species of poetry, and he accepted with reckless inconsistency
the rules laid down in the Poetics: “I do not hesitate to confess… that
I deem it as infallible as the Elements of Euclid” 89 (who has ceased to
be infallible). Yet he implored his countrymen to abandon their
subserviency to Corneille, Racine, and Vol- taire, and to study the art
of drama as revealed in Shakespeare (who ignored Aristotle’s rules). He
felt that the French drama was too formal to effect that</p>
<p>The Hamburg experiment collapsed because the actors quarreled among
themselves and concurred only in resenting Lessing’s critiques.

<p>XXing pleasure he would form a picture that belonged rather to his
own mind than to the reality.” 70 This perceptive judgment well
described Lessing’s wayward life and mind.</p>
<p>Shall we stop him here in mid-career and look at him? He was of
medium height, proudly erect, strong and supple through regular
exercise; with fine features, dark-blue eyes, and light-brown hair that
kept its color till his death. He was warm in his friendships, hot in
his enmities. He was never so happy as in controversy, and the n he
dealt wounds with a sharp pen. “Let a critic,” he wrote, “… first seek
out someone with whom he can quarrel. Thus he will gradually get into a
subject, and the rest will follow as a matter of course. I frankly admit
that I have selected primarily the French authors for this purpose, and
among them particularly M. de Voltaire” 71 — which was brave enough. He
was a brilliant but reckless talker, quick in repartee. He had ideas
about everything, and they were too many and forceful to let him give
them order, consistency, or full effect. He enjoyed the pursuit of truth
more than the dangerous delusion of having found it. Hence his most re-
nowned remark:</p>
<p>Not the truth of which a man is — or believes himself to be —
possessed, but the sincere effort he has made to reach it, makes the
worth of a man. For not through the possession, but through the
investigation, of truth does he develop those energies in which alone
consists his ever-growing perfection. Possession makes the mind
stagnant, indolent, proud. If God held enclosed in His right hand all
truth, and in His left hand simply the ever-moving impulse toward truth,
although with the condition that I should eternally err, and said to me,
“Choose!,” I should humbly bow before His left hand, and say, “Father,
give! Pure truth is for Thee alone.” 72</p>
<p>Two precious friendships remained from the Hamburg fiasco. One was
with Elise Reimarus, daughter of Hermann Reimarus, who was professor of
Oriental languages in the Hamburg Academy. She made her home a center
for the most cultivated society in the city; Lessing joined her circle,
and Mendelssohn and Jacobi came when they were in town; we shall see the
vital part that this association playe d in Lessing’s history. Still
more intimate was his attachment with Eva Kqnig. Wife of a silk
merchant, mother of four children, she was, Lessing tells us, “bright
and animated, gifted with womanly tact and graciousness,” and “still had
some of the fres hness and charm of youth.” 73 She too gathered about
her a salon of cultured friends, of whom Lessing was facile princeps.
When her husband left for Venice in 1769 he said to Lessing, “I commend
my family to you.” It was hardly a provident ar - rangement, for the
dramatist had no asset but genius, and owed a thousand thalers. And in
October of that year he accepted an invitation from Prince Karl Wilhelm
Ferdinand of Brunswick to take charge of the ducal library at
Wolfenbiittel. This town had declined to some six thousand souls since
the removal (1753) of the reigning Duke’s residence to Brunswick, seven
miles away, but Casanova reckoned the collection of books and
manuscripts to be “the third greatest library in the world.” 74 Lessing
was to receiv e six hundred thalers a year, with two assistants and a
servant, and free residence in the old ducal palace. In May, 1770, he
settled in his new home.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5*3</p>
<p>He was not a successful librarian; still he pleased his employer by
discover- ing, amid the manuscripts, a famous but lost treatise by
Berengar of Tours (998-1088), questioning transubstantiation. In his now
sedentary life he missed the strife and stimulus of Hamburg and Berlin;
poring over bad print in poor light weakened his eyes and brought on
headaches; his health began to fail. He consoled himself by writing
another drama, Emilia Galotti, which expressed his resentment of
aristocratic privileges and morals. Emilia is the daughter of an ardent
republican; their sovereign, the Prince of Guastalla, desires her, has
her fiance murdered, and abducts her to his palace; the father finds
her, and, at her insistence, stabs her to death; then he surrenders him-
self to the Prince’s court and is condemned to die, while the Prince con
- tinues his career only momentarily disturbed. The passion and
eloquence of the play redeemed its finale; it became a favorite tragedy
on the German stage; Goethe dated from its premiere (1772) the
resurrection of German literature. Some critics hailed Lessing as a
German Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In April, 1775, Lessing went to Italy as cicerone to Prince Leopold
of Brunswick. For eight months he enjoyed Milan, Venice, Bologna,
Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Pavia, Turin, Corsica, Rome; there he was
presented to Pope Pius VI, and may have seen, belatedly, the Laocodn. By
February, 1776, he was again at Wolfenbiittel. He thought of resigning,
but was per- suaded to stay by an increase of two hundred thalers in his
salary, and by receiving a hundred louis d’or per year as adviser to the
Mannheim theater.</p>
<p>Controversy sustained him. On March 1, 1768, Hermann Reimarus passed
away, leaving his wife a voluminous manuscript which he had never dared
to print. We have said a word elsewhere 75 about this “Schutzschrift fur
die verniinftigen Verehrer G ottes” (Apology for the Rational Worshipers
of God). Lessing had seen some of this remarkable work; he asked Frau
Rei- marus to let him publish parts of it; she agreed. As librarian he
had authority to publish any manuscript in the collection. He deposi ted
the “Schutzschrift” in the library, and then published a part of it in
1774 as The Toleration of Deists,… by an Anonymous Writer. It made no
stir. But the supernatural experts were aroused by the second portion of
Reimarus’ manuscript, which Lessing issued in 1 777 as Something More
from the Papers of the Anonymous Writer, concerning Revelation. It
argued that no revelation addressed to a single people could win
universal acceptance in a world of so many diverse races and faiths;
only a minority of humanity had yet, after seventeen hun- dred years,
heard of the Judaeo-Christian Bible; consequently it could not be
accepted as God’s revelation to mankind. A final fragment, The Aims of
Jesus and His Disciples (1778), presented Jesus not as the Son of God
but as a fervent mystic who shared the view of some Jews that the world
as then known would soon end, and be followed by the establishment of
God’s king -</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XX5H</p>
<p>dom on earth; the Apostles (said Reimarus) so understood him, for
they hoped to be appointed to thrones in this coming kingdom. When the
dream collapsed with Jesus’ despairing cry on the Cross— “My God, my
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”— the Apostles (Reimarus supposed)
invented the fable of his resurrection to conceal his defeat, and
pictured him as the re- warding and avenging judge of the world.</p>
<p>The shocked theologians attacked these “Wolfenbiittel Fragments” in
over thirty articles in the German press. Johann Melchior Goeze, chief
Ham- burg pastor, charged Lessing with secretly agreeing with the
“Anonymous Writer”; this hypocrite, he urged, should be punished by both
Church and state. Milder opponents reproved Lessing for publishing in
intelligible Ger- man doubts that should have been expressed, if at all,
in Latin to an esoteric few. Lessing replied in eleven pamphlets (1778)
that rivaled Pascal’s Lettres - cussion was a vital element in the
program of the Reformation; moreover, the people had a right to all
available knowledge; otherwise one Roman pope would be preferable to a
hundred Protestant prophets. After all (he argued) , the worth of
Christianity will remain even if the Bible be a human document and its
miracles mere pious fables or natural events. — The ducal government
confiscated the Wolfenbiittel Fragments and the Reimarus manuscript, and
ordered Lessing to</p>
<p>Brunswick censor.</p>
<p>Silenced in his pulpit, Lessing turned to the stage, and wrote his
finest play. Made insolvent again by the expenses involved in the
sickness and death of his wife, he borrowed three hundred thalers from a
Hamburg Jew to provide the leisure to finish Nathan der Weise. He placed
the action in Jerusalem during the Fourth Crusade. Nathan is a pious
Jewish merchant whose wife and seven sons are slaughtered by Christians
demoralized through years of war. Three days later a friar brings him a
Christian infant whose mother has just died, and whose father, recently
slain in battle, has on several occasions saved Nathan from death.
Nathan names the child Recha, brings her up as his daughter, and teaches
her only those religious doctrines on which Jews, Christians, and
Moslems are agreed.</p>
<p>Eighteen years later, while Nathan is away on business, his house
burns down; Recha is rescued by a young Knight Templar who disappears
without identifying himself; Recha thinks him a miraculous angel.
Nathan, returning, searches for the rescuer to reward him, is insulted
by him as a Jew, but per- suades him to come and receive Recha’s
gratitude. He comes, falls in love with her and she with him; but when
he learns that she was of Christian birth and is not being reared as a
Christian, he wonders is he not bound by his knightly oath to report the
matter to the Christian Patriarch of Jerusalem. He describes his problem
to the Patriarch without naming individuals; the Patriarch guesses they
are Nathan and Recha, and vows to have Nathan put</p>
<p>publish nothing further without the approval of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5*5</p>
<p>o death. He sends a friar to spy on the Jew. But this is the same
friar who brought Recha to Nathan eighteen years before; he has
observed, through these years, the kindly wisdom of the merchant; he
tells him of his danger, and deplores the religious animosity that has
made men so murderous.</p>
<p>Saladin, now governor of Jerusalem, is in financial straits. He sends
for Nathan, hoping to arrange a loan. Nathan comes, senses Saladin’s
need, and offers the loan before being asked. The Sultan, knowing
Nathan’s reputation</p>
<p>Was Nathan modeled on Moses Mendelssohn? There are resemblances
between the two, as we shall see in a later chapter; and, despite many
differ- ences, it is probable that Lessing found in his friend much to
inspire his idealization of the merchant of Jerusalem. Perhaps Lessing,
in his eagerness to preach toleration, painted the Jew and the Moslem
with more sympathy than the Christian; the Templar is, in his first
meeting with Nathan, fanati- cally harsh, and the Patriarch (Lessing’s
memory of Goeze?) hardly does justice to the kindly and enlightened
bishops who were then governing Trier, Mainz, and Cologne. The Christian
public of Germany repudiated the play as unfair when it was published in
1779; several of Lessing’s friends joined in the criticism. Nathan the
Wise did not reach the stage till 1783, and on the third night the house
was empty. In 1801 a version prepared by Schiller and Goethe was well
received at Weimar, and thereafter the play remained for a century a
favorite in German theaters.</p>
<p>A year before his death Lessing issued his final appeal for
understanding. He couched it in religious terms, as if to mollify
resistance and provide a bridge from old ideas to new. In some aspects
the essay The Education of the Human Race (Die Erziehung des
Menschengeschlects, 1780) justifies the old ideas; then we perceive that
the apology is a plea for the Enlightenment. All history may be viewed
as a divine revelation, as a gradual education of</p>
<p>5 16</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmankind. Every great religion was a stage in that step-by-step
illumination; it was not, as some Frenchmen had supposed, a trick
imposed upon credulous people by self-seeking priests; it was a world
theory intended to civilize humanity, to inculcate virtue, decency, and
social unity. In one stage (the Old Testament) religion sought to make
men virtuous by promising them worldly goods in a long life; in another
stage (the New Testament) it sought to overcome the discouraging
discrepancy between virtue and earthly suc- cess by promising rewards
after death; in both cases the appeal was adjusted to the limited
understanding of the people at the time. Each religion con- tained a
precious kernel of truth, which may have owed its acceptance to the
coating of error that sweetened it. If, around the basic beliefs,
theologians developed dogmas hard to understand, like original sin and
the Trinity, these doctrines too were symbols of truth and instruments
of education: God may be conceived as one power with many aspects and
meanings; and sin is original in the sense that we are all born with a
tendency to resist moral and social laws. 77 But supernatural
Christianity is only a step in the evolution of the human mind; a higher
stage comes when the race learns to reason, and when men grow strong and
clear enough to do the right because it is seen to be right and
reasonable, rather than for material or heavenly rewards. That stage has
been reached by some individuals; it has not yet come to the race, but
“it will come! It will assuredly come,… the time of a new, eter - nal
Gospel!” 78 Just as the average individual rec apitulates in his growth
the intellectual and moral development of the race, so the race slowly
passes through the intellectual and moral development of the superior
individual. To put it Pythagoreanly, each of us is reborn and reborn
until his education — his adjustment to reason — is complete.</p>
<p>What were Lessing’s final views on religion? He accepted it as an
immense aid to morality, but he resented it as a system of dogmas
demanding accept- ance on pain of sin, punishment, and social obloquy.
He thought of God as the inner spirit of reality, causing development
and itself developing; he thought of Christ as the most ideal of men,
but only metaphorically an in- carnation of this God; and he hoped for a
time when all theology would have disappeared from Christianity, and
only the sublime ethic of patient kindness and universal brotherhood
would remain. In the draft of a letter to Mendels- sohn he declared his
adherence to Spinoza’s view that body and mind are the</p>
<p>Lessing’s heresies, and his occasional trucu lence in controversy,
left him lonely in his final years. He had a few friends in Brunswick,
with whom, now and then, he came to chat and play chess. His wife’s
children lived with him in Wolfenbiittel; he devoted entirely to them
the little legacy she had left. But his adversaries denounced him
throughout Germany as a monstrous</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5i7</p>
<p>atheist. He defied them, and dared to oppose the man who paid his
salary: when Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, now (1780) duke of Brunswick, threw
into prison a young Jew who had incurred his displeasure, Lessing
visited the youth in jail, and later took him into his house to win back
health.</p>
<p>His own health was gone. His eyesight was now so dim that he could
hardly read. He suffered from asthma, weakening of the lungs, hardening
of the arteries. On February 3, 1781, on a visit to Brunswick, he
experienced a severe asthmatic attack, and vomited blood. He instructed
his friends: “W hen you see me about to die, call a notary; I will
declare before him that I die in none of the prevailing religions.” 81
On February 1 5, as he lay in bed, some friends gathered in the next
room. Suddenly the door of his room opened; Lessing appeared, bent and
weak, and raised his cap in greeting; then he sank to the floor in an
apoplectic stroke. A theological journal announced that at his death
Satan bore him away to hell as another Faust who had sold his soul. 82
He left so little money that the Duke had to pay for his funeral.</p>
<p>He was the herald of Germany’s greatest literary age. In the year of
his passing Kant published the epochal Critique of Pure Reason, and
Schiller published his first play. Goethe looked up to Lessing as the
great liberator, the father of the German Enlightenment. “In life,” said
Goethe to Lessing’s shade, “we honored you as one of the gods; now that
you are dead your spirit reigns over all souls.”</p>

<li>the romantic reaction</li>
</ol>
<p>Goethe spoke for a small minority; the great majority of the German
peo- ple clung to their Christian heritage, and they hailed as divinely
inspired the poet who sang their faith. Six years after Handel stirred
at least Ireland with the heavenly strains of Messiah, Friedrich
Gottlieb Klopstock won the heart of Germany with the first fervent
cantos of Der Messias ( 1 748-7 3 ).</p>
<p>Born in 1724, Klopstock antedated Lessing by five years, survived him
by twenty-two. Lessing, the son of a clergyman, became a freethinker;
Klop- stock, the son of a lawyer, took as a main mission of his life the
composition of an epic poem on the life of Christ. He was so aflame with
his theme that he published the first three cantos when still a lad of
twenty-four. These unrhymed hexameters won so grateful an audience that
when, a year later, he proposed to his cousin, letters came to her from
various parts of Germany urging her to accept him; she refused. But
Frederick V of Denmark, on the recommendation of his minister Johann von
Bernstorff, invited Klopstock to come and live at the Danish court and
finish his epic at four hundred thalers a year. On his way to Copenhagen
the poet took kindly to a Hamburg ad- mirer, Margareta Moller; in 1754
he married her; in 1758 she died, breaking his heart and darkening his
verse. He commemorated her in the fifteenth canto of The Messiah, and in
some of the most moving of his odes. He stayed in Copenhagen twenty
years, fell from favor when Bernstorff was dismissed, returned to
Hamburg, and in 1773 published the final cantos of his massive poem.</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXIt began with an invocation echoing Milton; then through twenty
cantos it told the sacred story from the meditations of Christ on the
Mount of Olives to his ascension into heaven. After taking almost as
long to write his epic as Jesus had taken to live it, Klopstock
concluded with a grateful Te Deum:</p>
<p>Lo, I have reached my goal! The stirring thought</p>
<p>Thrills through my spirit. Thine all-powerful arm,</p>
<p>My Lord, my God, alone hath guided me</p>
<p>By more than one dark grave, ere I might reach</p>
<p>That distant goal! Thou, Lord, hast healed me still,</p>
<p>Hast shed fresh courage o’er my sin king heart.</p>
<p>Which held with death its near companionship;</p>
<p>And if I gazed on terrors, their dark shapes</p>
<p>Soon disappeared, for thou protectedst me!</p>
<p>Swiftly they vanished. — Savior, I have sung</p>
<p>Thy Covenant of Mercy. I have trod</p>
<p>My fearful path! My hope hath been in Thee ! 83</p>
<p>The Messiah was welcomed by orthodox Germany as the best poetry yet
written in the German language. Goethe tells of a Frankfurt councilor
who read the first ten cantos “every year in Passion Week, and thus
refreshed himself for the entire year.” As for himself, Goethe could
enjoy the epic only by “discarding certain requirements which an
advancing cultivation does not willingly abandon.” 84 Klopstock poured
his piety so profusely into his verse that his poem became a succession
of lyrics and Bachian chorales rather than the fluent narrative that an
epic should be; and we find it difficult to follow a lyric flight
through twenty cantos and twenty-five years.</p>
<p>As Voltaire generated his opposite in Rousseau, so Lessing, by his
skepti- cism, rationalism, and intellectualism, made Germany feel the
need of writers who would, in contrast, recognize the place and rights
of feeling, sentiment, imagination, mystery, romance, and the
supernatural in human life. In some Germans of this period, especially
women, the cult of Empfindsamkeit (sen- sibility) became a religion as
well as a fashion. Darmstadt had a “Circle of Sensitives” whose members
made a principle and ritual of sentiment and emo - tional expression.
Rousseau was the Messiah of these spirits. His influence in Germany was
far greater than Voltaire’s; Herder and Schiller acknowledged him as a
fountainhead; Kant’s Critique of Practical Reason was suffused with
Rousseau; Goethe began with Rousseau (“ Gefiihl ist Alles”), went on to
Voltaire (“ Gedenke zu leben!”), and ended by knocking their heads to -
gether. From England, meanwhile, came the poets of feeling, James Thom-
son, William Collins, Edward Young, and the novelists of feeling, Rich-
ardson and Ste rne. The Reliques of Percy and the “Ossianic” poems of
Macpherson aroused interest in medieval poetry, mystery, and romance;
Klopstock and Heinrich von Gerstenberg brought to life the pre-Christian
mythology of Scandinavia and Germany.</p>
<p>Johann Georg Hamann, before 1781, was the Kapellmeister of the revolt
against reason. Bom, like Kant, in cloudy Konigsberg, strongly imbued by
his father with religious feeling, educated in the university, he
labored in poverty as a tutor, and found solace in a Protestant faith
resilient to all the blows of the Enlightenment. Reason, he contended,
is only a part of man,</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5 l 9</p>
<p>lately developed and not fundamental; instinct, intuition, feeling,
are deeper; and a true philosophy will base itself upon the whole nature
and gamut of man. Language originated not as a product of reason but as
a gift of God for the expression of feeling. Poetry is deeper than
prose. Great literature is written not by knowledge and observance of
rules and reasons, but by that indefinable quality called genius, which,
guided by feeling, overleaps all rules.</p>
<p>Friedrich Jacobi agreed with Hamann and Rousseau. Spinoza’s
philosophy, he said, is perfectly logical if you accept logic, but it is
false because logic never reaches the heart of reality, which is
revealed only to feeling and faith. God’s existence cannot be proved by
reason, but feeling knows that without belief in God the life of man is
a tragic and hopeless futility.</p>
<p>With this exaltation of feeling and poetry, the Teutonic soul was
primed for such flights of imaginative literature as made the second
half of the eight- eenth century in Germany recall the fervor and
fertility of Elizabethan England. Magazines of poetry multiplied,
suffering their usual brief tenure of fife. Johann Heinrich Voss,
besides translating Homer, Virgil, and Shake- speare, wrote a tender
novel in verse, Luise (1783-95), which won the heart of Germany and
stirred Goethe to rivalry. Salomon Gessner gained an inter- national
audience with his delicate lyrics and prose pastorals. Matthias Clau-
dius touched a hundred thousand mothers with idyllic songs of
domesticity, like his “Wiegenlied bei Mondenschein zu singen” (Lullaby
to Sing by the Light of the Moon) :</p>
<p>So schlafe nun , du Kleinef</p>
<p>Was weinest du?</p>
<p>Sanft ist im Mondenscheine</p>
<p>Und suss die Rub.</p>
<p>Auch kommt der Schlaf geschwinder ,</p>
<p>Und sonder Miih.</p>
<p>Der Mond freut sich der Kinder,</p>
<p>Und lie bet sie.</p>
<p>Sleep now, my little girl!</p>
<p>Why do you cry?</p>
<p>Soft in the moonlight,</p>
<p>And sweet, is rest.</p>
<p>Then sooner comes sleep,</p>
<p>And without pain.</p>
<p>The moon rejoices in children,</p>
<p>And loves you. 85</p>
<p>Gottfried Burger had all the qualities of a romantic genius. Son of a
pastor, he was sent to Halle and Gottingen to study law, but his
dissolute life led to his withdrawal from college. In 1773 he won
universal absolution of his sins by his ballad “Lenore.” Lenore’s lover
goes off with Frederick’s army to the siege of Prague. Each morning she
starts up from her dreams and asks, “Wil - helm, are you faithless, or
dead? How long will you tarry?” The war ends; the troops return; wives
and mothers and children greet them with joy and thanks to God.</p>

<p>From the piety of Klopstock and the tenderness of Gessner the
Romantic movement surged on to the irreverent individualism, the
“storming and striv - ing” of German youth in the ecstasy of moral and
social revolt. The stiff aristocracy of the courts, the fading dogmas of
the preachers, the dreary money-grubbing of the business class, the
dulling routine of bureaucrats, the pompous pedantry of pundits — all
aroused the resentment of young Germans conscious of ability and
deprived of place. They listened to Rousseau’s cry for naturalness and
freedom, but took no stock in his apotheosis of the “gen - eral will.”
They agreed with him in rejecting materia lism, rationalism, and
determinism, and with Lessing in preferring the lusty irregularity of
Shake- speare to the cramping classicism of Corneille and Racine. They
relished Voltaire’s wit, but thought they found a desert where he had
passed. They were thrilled by the rebellion of the American colonies
against England. “We wished the Americans all success,” Goethe recalled;
“the names of Franklin and Washington began to shine and sparkle in the
firmament of pol- itics and war.” 87 These Stunner und D r anger felt
the intoxication of physical adolescence and mental awakening, and
bemoaned the incubus of the old upon the young, of the state upon the
soul. They were all for originality, for direct experience and
unhindered expression, and some of them believed that their genius
exempted them from the law. They felt that time was on their side, that
the near future would see their victory. “Oh,” exclaimed Goethe,
“that</p>
<p>Some rebels expressed their philosophy by defying the conventions of
dress and replacing them with conventions of their own; so Christoph
Kauf- mann went about with head uncovered, hair uncombed, and shirt open
to the navel. 89 But this was exceptional; most of the protagonists,
barring a sui- cide or two, avoided such inverted sartorial display; and
some of them were well-to-do. Goethe himself was one of the progenitors
of Sturm und Drang</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>521</p>
<p>with his play Gotz von Berlichingen (1773); and in the following year
his Wert her became the triumphant standard of Romanticism; Schiller
joined the movement with Die Rduber (1781); but these complex and
evolving spirits soon left the campaign to more impassioned and
weakly-rooted youths.</p>
<p>Johann Merck was one of the founding fathers. To all appearances he
was sane and strong; he had gone through university, was persona grata
at the court of Hesse-Darmstadt, became paymaster general of the army,
and had a reputation for both sharp intelligence and practical ability.
Goethe, meeting him in 1771, was favorably impressed, and shared with
him and Herder in maintaining a critical review, the Frankfurter
gelehrte Anzeigen; hence the rebels were at first called “Frankfurters.”
90 Familiar with business and poli - tics, traveling through Germany and
into Russia, Merck saw and satirized the vanities of wealth, the tedium
of courts, and the exploitation of the peas- antry. Finding himself
powerless to reform these conditions, he became bitter and cynical.
Goethe called him “Mephistopheles Merck,” and took himself and Merck as
part models for the protagonists in Faust. Reverses in business and
misery in marriage unsettled Merck’s mind. He sank into debt, from which
the Duke of Saxe- Weimar, at Goethe’s request, rescued him. He fell a
prey to persistent melancholy, and killed himself at the age of fifty
(1791).</p>
<p>Even more tragic was the career of Reinhold Lenz. Son of a Lutheran
pastor in Livonia, his weak nerves and excitable temperament were
affected in childhood by stress on the doctrines of sin and hell. 91 He
was helped for a time by hearing Kant’s lectures in Konigsberg; Kant
introduced him to Rousseau’s writings, and soon Len z spoke of La
Nouvelle Helo’ise as the best book ever printed in France. At Strasbourg
he met Goethe, was fascinated by his positive character, imitated him in
thought and style, wrote lyrics so much like Goethe’s that they were
included in some editions of Goethe’s works. He went on to Sesenheim,
fell in love (after Goethe) with Friederike Brion, and composed fervent
poems in her praise. He assured her that unless she returned his love he
would kill himself; she did not and he did not. He moved to W eimar, was
befriended by Goethe, envied Goethe’s success, mocked Goethe’s relation
with Charlotte von Stein, and was invited by the Duke to leave the
duchy. He had considerable talent as poet and dramatist. One of his
plays, Die Soldaten, sharply satirized class distinctions and bour-
geois life; its central character is a middle-class girl who, aspiring
in vain to marry an officer, becomes a prostitute and solicits her
unrecognized father in the streets. Himself too unstable to find a firm
footing in life, Lenz wan- dered from post to post and failure to
failure, suffered spells of madness, repeatedly tried suicide, and died
insane (1792).</p>
<p>Maximilian von Klinger was the cleverest of the Stiirmer. He
denounced the world and rose to high place in it; he indulged in violent
speech in his plays, and became curator of the University of Dorpat; he
enjoyed all the oats and follies of youth and lived to be seventy-nine.
It was of him that</p>
<p>Go ethe wrote the perceptive line, “In girls we love what they are,
but in young men what they promise to be.” Klinger’s most famous play,
Sturm und Drang (1776), written at the age of twenty-four, gave its name
and</p>
<p>5 22</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmood to the movement. It showed European rebels expatriating
themselves to America in the hope of finding free outlets for their
individualities; its language was that of passion run wild; its gospel
was that of genius liberated from all rules. Klinger served in the
Austrian and Russian armies, married a natural daughter of Catherine the
Great, subsided into a professorship, and congealed into a pillar of the
state.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Heinse capped Sturm und Drang with a novel, Ardinghello</p>
<p>(1787), which united anarchism, nihilism, communism, fascism,
amoralism, and will to power in a revel of sensuality and crime. Crime
is not crime, says the hero, if it is brave; the only real crime is
weakness; the truest virtues are strength and courage of body and will.
Life is the manifestation of elemental instincts, and we miss the mark
if we brand these as immoral. So Ardinghello seduces and murders at
opportunity or whim, and sees in his unshackled pas- sions nature’s
highest law. He describes the exploits of Hannibal, honors him as a
superman, and asks: “What are millions of men— who all their lives have
not had a single hour like his — compared with this one man?” 92 He
founds a communistic society with communism of women, woman suffrage,
and the worship of the elements as the only religion.</p>
<p>In the confused whirlwind of Sturm und Drang some dominating ideas
gave the movement character and influence. Most of its leaders came from
the middle class, and began their revolt as a protest against the
privileges of birth, the insolence of office, and the luxury of prelates
feasting on peasants’ tithes. They all agreed in commiserating the lot,
and idealizing the character, of the peasant, serf or free. They
challenged women to discard their fashions and farthingales, their
sentiment and swooning and submissive piety, and summoned them to come
and share the exciting life of the emancipated mind and the roaming
male. They redefined religion as a divine afflatus in a soul whose
genius is part of the creative urge and mystery of the world. They
identified nature with God, and concluded that to be natural was to be
divine. They took the medieval legend of Faust as a symbol for the
intellectual hun- ger and burning ambition that breaks through all
barriers of tradition, con- vention, morals, or laws. So “Maler Muller,”
long before Goethe, wrote a drama, Fausts Leben, “because I early
recognized him as a great fellow… who feels all his power, feels the
bridle that fate has put upon him, and tries to throw it off, who has
the courage to hurl everything down that steps in his way.” 98</p>
<p>The enthusiasm and exaggerations of Sturm und Drang marked it as an
expression of intellectual adolescence, the voice of a minority
condemned to grow up and simmer down. The movement won no popular
support, for tradition and the people have always supported each other.
Finding them- selves without a base in the structure of German life, the
Stormers made their peace with the princes, and, like the philosophes,
trusted that enlightened rulers would lead the way to intellectual
liberation and social reform. Her- der, Goethe, and Schiller touched the
movement in their youth, withdrew from the consuming fire, clipped their
claws and folded their wings, and gratefully accepted the protection of
Weimar’s genial dukes.</p>

<p>FREDERICK S GERMANY</p>
<p>5 2 3</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE ARTISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Germans of this age were quite equal to the French and Italians
in art. They took baroque from Italy and rococo from France, but they
gave Winckelmann and Mengs to Italy, and their expatriates David
Roentgen, “Jean” Riesener, and Adam Weisweiler wer e preferred to French
cabinet- makers by French kings and queens; so Louis XVI paid eighty
thousand livres for a secretaire by Roentgen. 94 The Residenz at Munich,
Frederick’s Neues Palais at Potsdam, and the homes of well-to-do Germans
were crowded with massive furniture elaborately carved, until, at the
end of this age, a lighter style came in from England’s Chippendale and
Sheraton. — The Meissen factories had been injured in the war, but
Nymphenburg, Ludwigs- burg, Potsdam, and other centers carried on the
arts of porcelain and faience. German shelves, mantels, tables, and
desks smiled with jolly, graceful danc- ing, singing, kissing
figurines.</p>
<p>On a larger scale there was admirable statuary. Martin Klauer made a
bust of Goethe in the early Weimar days — eager, bright-eyed, confident.
95 Mar- tin’s son Ludwig did not do so well with Schiller; 96 better is
the Schiller now in a square at Stuttgart, by Johann von Dannecker.
Supreme in German sculpture in this age was Johann Gottfried Schadow,
who became court sculptor at Berlin in 1788. In 1791 he made a head of
Frederick; in 1793 he carved him in full length; in 1816 he cast in
bronze a smaller Frederick 97 — an unforgettable masterpiece. He cast
the bronze Quadriga of Victory for the Brandenburg Gate, and achieved an
almost classical loveliness in the marble group of Crown Princess Luise
and her sister Friederike.</p>
<p>Germany had so many painters that she could afford to surrender a
dozen of them to Italy and still have good ones left. Tischbeins were so
numerous in the brotherhood of the brush that we can confuse them with
ease. Johann Heinrich Tischbein, painter to the court of Hesse-Cassel,
made a fine portrait of Lessing. His nephew Johann Friedrich Tischbein
painted in Cassel, Rome, Naples, Paris, Vienna, The Hague, Dessau,
Leipzig, and St. Petersburg, and made a charming group of the children
of Duke Karl August of Saxe- Weimar. Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein
lived in Italy 1787-99, painted a famous picture, Goethe in the Roman
Campagna, and returned to be court painter to the Duke of Oldenburg.</p>
<p>One source of the German Drang nach Italien was Adam Friedrich Oeser,
sculptor, painter, etcher, teacher, champion of art reform on classic
lines; Winckelmann lived with him for a time in Dresden, criticized his
drawing, admired his character, and said, “He knows as much as one can
know outside of Italy.” 98 In 1764 Oeser was made director of the art
academy at Leipzig; Goethe visited him there, and caught the Italian
fever.</p>
<p>Of those artists who remained in Germany Daniel Chodowiecki led the
list, and he was a Pole. Born in Danzig, left an orphan, he learned to
support himself by drawings, engravings, and paintings. In 1743 he moved
to Berlin,</p>
<p>524 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXand became German in all but name. He told the life of Christ in
superb miniatures which gave him a national reputation; then, in a more
Voltairean mood, he painted Jean Calas and His Family. His drawings were
in such de- mand that for years hardly any major work of literature was
published in Prussia without illustrations from his hand. In the finest
of his etchings he sketched his own household: himself at work, his wife
proudly surveying her five children, the walls covered with art. With a
red crayon he drew the figure of Lotte Kestner, whom Goethe loved and
lost. In his work there is a grace of line and a tenderness of feeling
that distinguish him from Hogarth, to whom he was often compared because
of his many pictures of common life; but he rightly deprecated such a
correlation. Often he was inspired by Watteau; A Gathering in the
Zoological Garden 99 has Watte au’s flair for the open air and the
entrancing swirl of feminine robes.</p>
<p>Anton Graff left a portrait of Chodowiecki 100 — all smiles and curls
and avoirdupois — and a portrait of himiself 101 looking up from his
work but dressed as for a ball. He put more spirit into his lovely
portrait of his wife, 102 caught the pride of the actress Korona
Schroter, 103 and glorified with golden raiment the overflowing form of
Frau Hofrat Bohme. 104</p>
<p>Last of the line in this half century was Asmus Jakob Carstens; who
ab- sorbed Winckelmann’s gospel in letter and spirit, and completed the
classic revival in German painting. Born in Schleswig, schooled in
Copenhagen and Italy, he worked chiefly in Liibeck and Berlin; but he
went back to Italy in 1792, and feasted on the remains of ancient
sculpture and architecture. He did not know that time had washed away
the color from Greek art, leaving only line; so, like Mengs, he reduced
his brush to a pencil, and aimed only at perfect form. He was disturbed
by the physical imperfections of the models who posed in the studios; he
decided to trust to his imagination; and he delighted in picturing Greek
gods, and scenes from Greek mythology, as he and Winckelmann conceived
them. From these he passed to illustrating Dante and Shakespeare. Always
his passion for line and form missed color and life; and even when he
achieved an almost Michelangelesque vision of godlike figures, as in The
Birth of Light , 105 we can only praise him for re- membering the
Sistine Chapel ’s paintings as accurately as Mozart remem - bered its
music. Rome returned his affection, and gave his work (1795) one of the
most extensive and celebrated exhibitions that any modern artist had
ever received. There, three years later, he died, still only forty-four
years old. Art, like sex, can be a consuming fire.</p>
<p>The neoclassic mood dominated the architectural embellishment of
Pots- dam and Berlin under Frederick the Great. He had begun the Neues
Palais in 1755; he did not let the war deter him from the project. Three
architects — Biiring, Gontard, and Manger — shared in designing it; they
mingled classic with baroque in an imposing edifice that recalled the
palaces of ancient Rome; and in the interior decoration they rivaled the
finest specimens of French rococo. The Franzosische Kirche, or French
Church, in Berlin had a classic portico; Gontard and his pupil Georg
Unger added a classic tower (1780-</p>
<p>85). Unger augmented the majesty of Berlin with a Konigliche
Bibliothek,</p>

<p>FREDERICK S GERMANY</p>
<p>525</p>
<p>or Royal Library, in 1774-80. The Brandenburger Tor, or Brandenburg
Gate, raised by Karl Langhans in 1788-91, was frankly modeled on the
Propylaea of the Acropolis; it barely survived the Second World War, but
lost the famous Quadriga, the four-horse chariot with which Schadow had
crowned it.</p>
<p>Other German cities were minting monuments to house princes, nobles,
and cadavers. Frederick’s sister Wilhelmine beautified Bayreuth with a
palace</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>AFTER BACH</li>
</ol>
<p>Germany was blessed and excited with music beyond any other nation
but Italy. A family without musical instruments was an abnormality.
Schools taught music almost on a par with religion and reading. Church
music was in decline because science and philosophy, cities and
industry, were secularizing minds; the great Lutheran hymns still
resounded, but song was passing from church choirs to lieder,
Singspiele, and opera. Johann Peter Schulz opened a new era in song with
his Lieder im V olkston (1782); henceforth Germany enjoyed an
unquestioned leadership in this application of music to lyric
poetry.</p>
<p>The mechanical improvement of the piano stimulated the spread of con-
certs and the rise of instrumental virtuosi. Performers like Johann
Schobert, Abt Vogler, and Johann Hummel conquered a dozen cities. On
March 10, 1789, Hummel, then eleven years old, gave a piano recital at
Dresden; he did not know that Mozart was to be in the audience; during
the concert he saw and recognized his former teacher; as soon as his
piece was finished he made his way through the applauding assemblage and
embraced Mozart with warm expressions of homage and joy. 106 Abt (i.e.,
Abbot) Vogler won his title by being ordained as a priest (1773); at
Mannheim he was both court chaplain and music director. As a writer on
music he was one of the most original and influential of the century; as
a virtuoso on the organ he won the jealousy of Mozart; as a teacher he
formed Weber and Meyerbeer; as a papal legate he made Mannheim laugh by
wearing blue stockings, carrying his breviary with his music, and
sometimes keeping his audience waiting while he finished his
prayers.</p>
<p>Mannheim’s orchestra was now a group of seventy -six select
musicians, ably led by Christian Cannabich as teacher, conductor, and
solo violinist. Famous was Lord Fordyce’s remark that Germany stood at
the hea d of the nations for two reasons: the Prussian army and the
Mannheim orchestra. Only less renowned was the Gewandhaus orchestra in
Leipzig. Concerts were gigantic — three or four, sometimes six,
concertos on one program; and</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhey were everywhere — in theaters, churches, universities, palaces,
taverns, and parks. The symphony now competed with the concerto in the
orchestral repertoire; by 1770 — even before Haydn — it was accepted as
the highest form of instrumental music. 107</p>
<p>Half the famous composers of this period came from the strong heart
and loins of Johann Sebastian Bach. By his first wife he had seven
children, of whom two, Wilhelm Friedemann and Karl Philipp Emanuel,
achieved inter- national celebrity. By his second wife he had thirteen
children, of whom two, Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian,
became prominent in music. Johann Christoph Friedrich begot a minor
composer, Wilhelm Fried- rich Ernst Bach, so that Johann Sebastian gave
the world five men who se- cured a place in music history. A distant
relative, Johann Ernst Bach, studied with the master at Leipzig, became
Kapellmeister at Weimar, and left several compositions to oblivion.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Friedemann Bach was born at Weimar. The first part of his</p>
<p>father’s Wohltemperirte Klavier was written for his instruction. He
pro - gressed rapidly, and was already a composer at sixteen. At
twenty-three he was appointed organist at the Sophienkirche in Dresden;
and as his duties there were light, he wrote several sonatas, concertos,
and symphonies. He rose in stipend and fame by being chosen (1746)
organist at the Liebfrauen- kirche in Halle. There he remained eighteen
years; so he came to be called the “Halle Bach.” He loved drink only
next to music; he resigned in 1764, and for twenty years he drifted from
town to town, living literally from hand to mouth by giving recitals and
taking pupils. In 1774 he settled in Berlin, where he died in poverty in
1784.</p>
<p>Karl Philipp Emanuel Bach was lefthanded, and so had to confine his
musi- cal performance to the organ and the piano. In 1734, aged twenty,
he entered the University of Frankfurt; there he enjoyed the friendship
of Georg Philipp Telemann, who had been one of his godfathers and had
given him part of his name. In 1737 he played some of his compositions
before an audi- ence that included Frederick William I of Prussia.
Knowing that Crown Prince Frederick loved music, he went to Rheinsberg
and presented himself, with no immediate result; but in 1740 Frederick,
now king, appointed him cembalist in the chapel orchestra at Potsdam. He
found it irritating to accom- pany Frederick’s temperamental flute and
to accept his royal authority in music. After sixteen years of service
in the orchestra he retired to specialize in teaching. His V er such
iiber die ivahre Art das Klavier zu spielen (1753 f.) marked the
beginning of modem pianoforte technique; Haydn formed his piano artistry
on this manual , and because of it Mozart said of this “Berlin Bach”:
“He is the father, we are his boys ( Buben ); those of us who know
anything correctly have learned from him, and any [student] who does not
confess this is a rascal [Lmtip].” 108 In his compositions Emanuel
consciously diverged from his father’s contrapuntal style to a simpler
homophonic treat - ment and melodic line. In 1767 he accepted the post
of director of church music at Hamburg; there he spent the remaining
twenty-one years of his life. In 1795 Haydn came to Hamburg to see him,
only to find that the great- est of Jobann Sebastian’s sons was seven
years dead.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>FREDERICK S GERMANY</p>
<p>527</p>
<p>Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, after studying with his father and
at the University of Leipzig, became at eighteen ( 1750) Kammermusikus
at Biicke- burg to Wilhelm, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe; at twenty-six he
was Kon- •zertmeister. The great event in his twenty -eight years at
this court was the coming of Herder (1771) as preacher; Herder provided
him with inspiring texts for oratorios, cantatas, and songs. Johann
Christoph followed his fa- ther’s methods and spirit, and was lost in
the changefulness of time.</p>
<p>In contrast, the youngest son, Johann Christian Bach, gave his
musical allegiance to Italy. Only fifteen when his father died, he was
sent to Berlin, where his half-brother Wilhelm Friedemann gave him
support and instruc- tion. At nineteen he went to Bologna, where Conte
Cavaliere Agostino Litta paid for his studies under Padre Martini. The
youth was so charmed by Italian life and Catholic music that he became a
convert, and for six years devoted his compositions chiefly to the
Church. In 1760 he was made organ- ist in the Milan cathedral, and
became the “Milan Bach.” Meanwhile Italian opera had aroused his
ambition to excel in secular as well as ecclesiastical music; he
produced operas at Turin and Naples (1761), and his Milan em- ployers
complained that the galanterie of these compositions discorded with his
position in the cathedral. Johann Christian changed his foot of earth to
London (1762), where his operas had unusually long runs. Soon he was ap-
pointed music master to Queen Charlotte Sophia. He welcomed the seven-
year-old Mozart to London in 1764, and frolicked with him at the piano.
The boy loved the now fully accomplished musician, and took many hints
from him in composing sonatas, operas, and symphonies. In 1778 Bach went
to Paris to present his Amadis des Gaules ; there he again met Mozart,
and the youth of twenty-two was as delighted with him as he had been
fifteen years before. “He is an honest man, and does people justice,”
Wolfgang wrote to his father; “I love him from my heart.” 109</p>
<p>All in all, this Bach dynasty, from the Veit Bach who died in 1619 to
the Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach who died in 1845, is the most
remarkable in cultural history. Of some sixty Bachs known by name among
the relatives of Johann Sebastian, fifty-three were professional
musicians; eight of his ances- tors and five of his progeny were of
sufficient caliber to warrant special articles in a dictionary of music.
110 Several of the sons won greater fame and reputation in their
lifetimes than Johann Sebastian had enjoyed. Not that they monopolized
musical fame; the executants, as usual, received the greater ac- claim
when alive, and were sooner forgotten when dead; and composers like Karl
Friedrich Fasch and Christian Friedrich Schubart rivaled Bach’s sons in
renown.</p>
<p>Looking back upon this second half of the eighteenth century we
perceive some special lines of musical evolution. The growing range and
power of the piano freed music from subservience to words, and
encouraged instrumental compositions. The widened audience for concerts,
and the lessening of eccle- siastical dominance, led composers away from
the polyphony of Johann Sebastian Bach to the more easily appreciated
harmonies of his successors. The influence of Italian opera made for
melody even in instrumental pieces, while, by a contrasting movement,
the lieder gave a new complexity to song.</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXThe revolt against Italian opera culminated in Gluck, who proposed
to sub- ordinate music to drama, but rather ennobled drama with music;
by another avenue the revolt developed the Singspiel, which reached its
peak in The Magic Flute. The concerto grosso passed into the concerto
for one solo instrument and orchestra; the sonata, in Karl Philipp
Emanuel Bach and Haydn, took its classic form, and the quartet evolved
into the symphony. Everything was prepared for Beethoven.</p>
<p>X. DER ALTE FRITZ</p>
<p>Over all this varied life of politics, religion, industry, amusement,
music, art, science, philosophy, philanthropy, and sin loomed the aging
hero whom Germany called Der Alte Fritz — not loving him, but honoring
him as the most amazing Teuton of his time. Not content with ruling his
kingdom and his orchestra, he envied Voltaire’ s pen, and longed to be
lauded as a poet and historian. He bequeathed to posterity thirty
volumes of writings: seven of history, six of poetry, three of military
treatises, two of philosophy, twelve of correspondence; all in French.
His poems were mostly of the “fugitive” kind, and have escaped
remembrance. He was one of the leading historians of the age. Early in
his reign he wrote the history of his ancestors — Memoir es pour servir
a I’histoire de la maison de Brandebourg (1751). Like most histori ans,
he claimed impartiality: “I have risen above all preju - dice; I have
regarded princes, kings, relatives, as ordinary men”; 111 but he rose to
rapture when describing Frederick William, the Great Elector.</p>
<p>His literary masterpiece was UHistoire de mon temps , recording his
own rule. He began it soon after the close of the First Silesian War
(1740-42), and continued it at intervals till late in life. Probably
under the influence of Voltaire — though writing much of this book
before the appearance of Vol- taire’s Le Siecle de Louis XIV and L’Essai
sur les moeurs— Frederick in- cluded the history of science, philosophy,
literature, and art. He apologized for spending space on “imbeciles
clothed in purple, charlatans crowned with a tiara…. But to follow the
discovery of new truths, to grasp the causes of change in morals and
manners, to study the processes by which the dark- ness of barbarism has
been lifted from the minds of men — these, surely, are subjects worthy
to occupy all thinking men.” 112 He praised Hobbes, Locke, and the
deists in England, Thomasius and Wolff in Germany, Fontenelle and
Voltaire in France. “These great men and their disciples struck a mortal
blow at religion. Men began to examine what they had stupidly adored;
reason overthrew superstition…. Deism, the simple worship of the Su-
preme Being, gained many followers.” 113 Despising the French government
but loving French literature, Frederick rated Voltaire’s Henriade above
the Iliad, and Racine above Sophocles; he equaled Boileau with Horace,
and Bossuet with Demosthenes. He laughed at the language and literature,
praised the architecture, of Germany. He labored to excuse his invasion
of Silesia: a statesman, he felt, may violate the Ten Commandments if
the vital</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>Frederick’s Germany</p>
<p>5 2 9</p>
<p>interests of his state require it; “it is better that the sovereign
should break his word than that the people should perish” 114 — which he
hoped we would believe had been the danger to Prussia in 1740. He
admitted making many mistakes as a general, but he thought it
unnecessary to record his flight at Mollwitz. All in all, these two
volumes rank with the best historical writing of modern Europe before
Gibbon.</p>
<p>Hardly had the Seven Years’ War been concluded when Frederick set
himself to writing his Histoire de la guerre de Sept Arts. Like Caesar
he aspired to be the best historian of his own campaigns, and like
Caesar he avoided embarrassment by speaking of himself in the third
person. Again, and perhaps with better reason, he sought to justify the
bold initiative with which he had opened hostilities. He lauded his
great enemy, Maria Theresa, in all that concerned her domestic
government, but in foreign relations he condemned her as “this proud
woman” who, “devoured by ambition, wished to reach the goal of glory by
every path.” 115 Amid his fairly impartial record of the campaigns, he
stopped to mourn the death of his mother in 1757 and of his sister in
1758; the page in which he described Wilhelmine is an oasis of love in a
waste of war.</p>
<p>He concluded that history is an excellent teacher, with few pupils.
“It is in the nature of man that no one learns from experience. The
follies of the fathers are lo st on their children; each generation has
to commit its own.” 116 “Whoever reads history with application will
perceive that the same scenes are often repeated, and that one need only
change the names of the ac- tors.” 117 And even if we could learn, we
should still be subject to unpredict- able chance. “These Memoirs
convince me more and more that to write history is to compile the
follies of men and the strokes of fortune. Every- thing turns on these
two articles.” 118</p>
<p>Twice (1752, 1768) in a Last Testament , he tried to convey some of
the lessons of his own experience to his heirs. He urged them to study
the aims and resources of the various states, and the methods available
for protecting and developing Prussia. He followed his father in
stressing the need of keep- ing the army in good order. He cautioned his
successors against spending beyond revenue; he predicted political
trouble for fiscally reckless France; and he advised that revenues be
increased not by imposing new taxes but by stimulating the productivity
of the economy. All religions should be protected if they kept the peace
— though “all religions, when one looks into them, rest on a system of
fable more or less absurd.” 119 The royal power should be absolute, but
the king should consider himself the first servant of the state. Since
Prussia was endangered by her smallness amid large states like Russia,
France, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the king should seize upon any
opportunity to enlarge and unify Prussia — preferably by con- quest of
Saxony, Polish Prussia, and Swedish Pomerania. “The first concern of a
prince is to maintain himself; the second is to extend his territory.
This demands suppleness and resource…. The way to hide secret ambitions
is to profess pacific sentiments till the favorable moment arrives. This
has been the method of all great statesmen.” 120</p>
<p>530</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXThe king should prepare his successor for government; he should
have him educated by enlightened men, not by ecclesiastics, for these
will stuff him with superstitions calculated to make him a docile tool
of the church. 121 Such an education produces a mediocre mind soon
crushed by the respon- sibilities of state. “That is what I have seen,
and if I except the Queen of Hungary [Maria Theresa] and the King of
Sardinia [Charles Emmanuel I], all the princes of Europe are merely
illustrious imbeciles.” 122 This was writ - ten when Elizabeth ruled
Russia; the Testament of 1768 was more polite, for Catherine had already
shown her mettle; now Frederick prophesied that Russia would be the most
dangerous power in Europe. 123</p>
<p>As he aged he began to wonder if his nephew and presumptive heir —
Frederick William II — was fit to inherit the government. “I labor for
you,” he wrote, “but one must think of keeping what I make; if you are
idle and indolent, what I have accumulated with so much trouble will
melt away in your hands.” 124 And in 1782, still more pessimistic, he
wrote: “If, after my death, my nephew goes soft,… within two years there
will no longer be a Prussia.” 125 The prediction was verified at Jena in
1806, not so much be - cause Frederick William II was soft, but because
Napoleon was hard.</p>
<p>Frederick himself, in his final decade, became unendurably hard. He
curbed much of the freedom that he had allowed to the press before 1756.
“Your Berlin freedom,” Lessing wrote to Nikolai in 1769, “reduces
itself… to the freedom to bring to market as many absurdities against
religion as you like…. But let someone… raise his voice on behalf of
subjects, and against exploitation and despotism,… and you will soon
discover which is the most servile land in Europe today.” 126 Herder
hated his native Prussia, and Winckelmann turned in “horror” from that
“despotic land.” 127 When Goethe visited Berlin in 1778 he was surprised
by the unpopularity of the King. Yet the people reverenced Frederick as
an old man who through forty-five years had not missed a day of service
to the state.</p>
<p>War and peace alike had worn him out. His attacks of gout and asthma,
of colic and hemorrhoids, had increased in frequency and severity, and
his pre- dilection for heavy meals and highly spiced foods intensified
his ailments. On August 22-25, 1 778, near Breslau, he reviewed his
Silesian army. On the twenty-fourth, dressed only in his usual uniform,
he sat on his horse for six hours in a heavy rain; he returned to his
quarters drenched and shivering; he was never well again. In June, 1786,
he summoned Dr. Zimmermann from Hanover. He balked at the drugs
prescribed for him, and preferred lively conversations about literature
and history; to keep him quiet Zimmermann prescribed Gi bbon’s Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire. 12 * Dropsy was added to his troubles, and
incisions made to reduce the swellings developed gangrene. Pneumonia
completed the siege, and on August 17, 1786, Freder- ick died, aged
seventy-four. He had asked to be buried in the garden of Sanssouci near
the graves of his dogs and his favorite horse; this parting edict on
humanity was ignored, and he was interred beside his father in the
Garri- son Church at Potsdam. When Napoleon, after defeating the
Prussians at Jena, came and stood before Frederick’s tomb, he said to
