<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>Middle Europe</p>
<p>1300-1460</p>
<p>I. LAND AND LABOR</p>
<p>S INCE man lives by permission of physical geography, it is his fate
to be divided by mountains, rivers, and seas into groups that develop,
in semi- isolation, their diverging languages and creeds, their
climatically conditioned features, customs, and dress. Driven by
insecurity to suspect the strange, he dislikes and condemns the alien,
outlandish looks and ways of other groups than his own. All those
fascinating varieties of terrain — mountains and valleys, fiords and
straits, gulfs and streams — that make Europe a pano- rama of diverse
delight, have broken the population of a minor continent into a score of
peoples cherishing their differences, and self -imprisoned in their
heritage of hate. There is a charm in this mosaic of originalities, and
one would deprecate a world of people confined in identical myths and
panta- loons. And yet, above and beneath these dissimilarities of
costume, custom, faith, and speech, nature and man’s needs have forced
upon him an economic uniformity and interdependence that become more
visible and compelling as invention and knowledge topple barriers away.
From Norway to Sicily, from Russia to Spain, the unprejudiced surveying
eye sees men not so much as diversely dressed and phrased, but as
engaged in like pursuits molding like characters: tilling and mining the
earth, weaving garments, building homes, altars, and schools, rearing
the young, trading surpluses, and forging social order as man’s
strongest organ of defense and survival. For a moment we shall
contemplate Middle Europe as such a unity.</p>
<p>In Scandinavia man’s prime task was to conquer the cold, in Holland
the sea, in Germany the forests, in Austria the mountains; agriculture,
the ground of life, hung its fate on these victories. By 1300 the
rotation of crops had become general in Europe, multiplying the yield of
the soil. But from J 347 to 1 381 half the population of Central Europe
was wiped out by the Black Death; and the mortality of men arrested the
fertility of the earth. In one year Strasbourg lost 14,000 souls, Cracow
20,000, Breslau 30,000.* For a century the Harz mines remained without
miners. 2 With simple animal patience men resumed the ancient labors,
digging and turning the earth. Sweden and Germany intensified their
extraction of iron and copper; coal</p>
<p>H3</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>was mined at Aachen and Dortmund, tin in Saxony, lead in the Harz,
silver in Sweden and the Tyrol, gold in Carinthia and Transylvania.</p>
<p>The flow of metals fed a growing industry, which fed a spreading
trade. Germany, leader in mining, naturally led in metallurgy. The blast
furnace appeared there in the fourteenth century; with the hydraulic
hammer and the rolling mill it transformed the working of metals.
Nuremberg became an ironmongers’ capital, famous for its cannon and its
bells. The industry and commerce of Nuremberg, Augsburg, Mainz, Speyer,
and Cologne made them almost independent city-states. The Rhine, Main,
Lech, and Danube gave the South German towns first place in the overland
traffic with Italy and the East. Great commercial and financial firms,
with far-flung outlets and agencies, rose along these routes,
surpassing, in the fifteenth cen- tury, the reach and power of the
Hanseatic League. The League was still strong in the fourteenth century,
dominating trade in the North and Baltic seas; but in 1397 the
Scandinavian countries united to break this monopoly, and soon
thereafter the English and Dutch began to carry their own goods. Even
the herring conspired against the Hanse; about 1417 they decided to
spawn in the North Sea rather than the Baltic; Lubeck, a pillar of the
League, lost the herring trade and declined; Amsterdam won it and
flourished.</p>
<p>Underneath this evolving economy class war seethed — between country
and city, lords and serfs, nobles and businessmen, merchant guilds and
craft guilds, capitalists and proletarians, clergy and laity, Church and
state. In Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland serfdom was going or gone, but
else- where in Middle Europe it was taking on new life. In Denmark,
Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania, and Brandenburg, where peasants had earned
their free- dom by clearing the wilderness, serfdom was restored in the
fifteenth cen- tury by a martial aristocracy; we may judge the harshness
of these Junkers from a proverb of the Brandenburg peasants, which
wished long life to the lord’s horses, lest he should take to riding his
serfs. 3 In the Baltic lands the barons and the Teutonic knights, at
first content to enserf the conquered Slav inhabitants, were induced, by
the labor shortages that followed the Black Death and the Polish war of
1409, to impress into bondage any “idlers who roam on the road or in the
towns”; 4 and treaties were made with neigh - boring governments for the
extradition of fugitive serfs.</p>
<p>The mercantile bourgeoisie, favored by the emperors as a foil to the
barons, ruled the municipalities so definitely that in many cases the
city lall and the merchants’ guildhall were one. Craft guilds were
reduced to ubjection, submitted to municipal regulation of wages, and
were prohibited from united action; 5 here, as in England and France,
proud craftsmen were turned into defenseless proletaires. Now and then
the workers tried revolt. In 1 348 the artisans of Nuremberg captured
the municipal council and ruled the city for a year, but the Emperor’s
soldiers restored the patrician mer -</p>

<p>chants to power.“ In Prussia an ordinance of 1358 condemned any
striker to have an ear cut off. 7 Peasant rebellions flared up in
Denmark ( 1 340, 1441 ), Saxony, Silesia, Brandenburg, and the Rhineland
(1432), in Norway and Sweden (1434); but they were too laxly organized
to achieve more than a passing cathartic violence. Revolutionary ideas
circulated through cities and villages. In 1438 an anonymous radical
wrote a pamphlet expounding an imaginary “Kaiser Sigismund’s
Reformation” on socialistic principles. 8 The stage was slowly prepared
for the Peasants’ War of 1525.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE ORGANIZATION OF ORDER</li>
</ol>
<p>Order is the mother of civilization and liberty; chaos is the midwife
of dictatorship; therefore history may now and then say a good word for
kings. Their medieval function was to free the individual in rising
measure from local domination, and to centralize in one authority the
power to legislate, judge, punish, mint, and make war. The feudal baron
mourned the loss of local autonomy, but the simple citizen thought it
good that there should be, in his country, one master, one coinage, one
law. Men rarely hoped, in those half-illiterate days, that even kings
might disappear, and leave no master but the laws and blunders that men
had freely made.</p>
<p>Scandinavia had some remarkable monarchs in the fourteenth century.
Magnus II of Sweden organized the conflicting laws of his kingdom into a
homogeneous national code (1347). In Denmark Eric IV disciplined the
barons and strengthened the central power; Christopher II weakened it;
Waldemar IV restored it, and made his country one of the major forces in
European politics. But the supreme -figure in the Scandinavian dynasties
of this age was Waldemar’s daughter Margaret. Married at ten (1363) to
Haakon VI of Norway, who was the son of Magnus II of Sweden, she seemed
destined by blood and marriage to unite the kindred thrones. When her
father died (1375) she hurried to Copenhagen with her five-year-old son
Olaf, and persuaded the baronial and ecclesiastical electors to accept
him as king and herself as regent. When her husband died ( 1 3 80) Olaf
inherited the crown of Norway; but as he was still only ten, Margaret,
now twenty- seven, there too acted as regent. Her prudence, tact, and
courage astonished her contemporaries, who were accustomed to male
incompetence or vio- lence; and the feudal lords of Denmark and Norway,
after dominating many kings, proudly supported this wise and beneficent
queen. When Olaf came of age (1385) her diplomacy won for him the
succession to the Swedish throne. Two years later he died, and her
patient, far-seeing plans for the unification of Scandinavia seemed
frustrated by his death. But the royal council of Denmark, seeing no
male heir available who could match “Mar -</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>grete” in ability to maintain order and peace, overrode Scandinavian
laws against a woman ruler, and elected her Regent of the Realm (1387).
Pro- ceeding to Oslo, she was chosen Regent of Norway for life (1388),
and a year later the Swedish nobles, having deposed an unsatisfactory
king, made her their queen. She prevailed upon all three kingdoms to
recognize her grandnephew Eric as heir to their thrones. In 1397 she
summoned the three councils of state to Kalmar in Sweden; there Sweden,
Norway, and Den- mark were declared to be forever united, all to be
under one ruler, but each to keep its own customs and laws. Eric was
crowned king, but as he was only fifteen, Margaret continued to act as
regent till her death (1412). No other European ruler of the age had so
extensive a realm, or so successful a reign.</p>
<p>Her grandnephew did not inherit her wisdom. Eric allowed the Union to
become in effect a Danish Empire, with a council at Copenhagen ruling
the three states. In this empire Norway declined, losing the literary
leadership that she had held from the tenth to the thirteenth century.
In 1434 Engel- brekt Engelbreksson led a revolt of Sweden against the
Danish hegemony; he gathered at Arboga (1435) a national diet of nobles,
bishops, yeomen, and burghers; and this broad-based assembly became,
through a continuity of 500 years, the Swedish Riksdag of today.
Engelbreksson and Kark Knut- sen were chosen regents. A year later the
hero of the revolution was assas- sinated, and Knutsen ruled Sweden as
regent, then intermittently as king, till his death (1470).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Christian I (1448-81) began the Oldenburg dynasty that</p>
<p>governed Denmark till 1863 and Norway till 1814. Iceland came under
Danish rule during Ma rgaret’s regency (1381). The high point of the</p>
<p>island’s history and literature had passed, but it continued to give
chaotic Europe an unheeded lesson in competent and orderly
government.</p>
<p>The strongest democracy in the world at this time was in Switzerland.
In the history of that invincible country the heroes are the cantons.
First were the German- speaking “forest cantons” of Uri, Schwyz, and
Unter - walden, which in 1291 united in a Confederation for mutual
defense. After the historic victory of the Swiss peasants over the
Hapsburg army at Morgar- ten (1315) the Confederation, while formally
acknowledging the sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire, maintained a
virtual independence. New can- tons were added: Lucerne (1332), Zurich
(1351), Glarus and Zug (1352), Bern (1353); and the name Schwyz was in
1352 extended to the whole. Encouraged to autonomy by geographical
barriers, and accepting French, German, or Italian speech and ways
according to the slope of its valleys and the course of its streams,
each canton made its own laws, through assemblies chosen by the vote of
the citizens. The extent of the franchise varied from</p>
<p>MIDDLE EUROPE</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>*47</p>
<p>canton to canton and from time to time, but all cantons pledged
themselves to a united foreign policy and to the arbitration of their
disputes by a federal diet. Though the cantons sometimes fought one
another, nevertheless, the constitution of the Confederation became and
remains an inspiring example of federalism — the union of self-governing
regions under freely accepted</p>
<p>To defend its liberty the Confederation required military training of
all males, and military service, at call, from all men between ten and
sixty years of age. The Swiss infantry, armed with pikes and sturdy
discipline, pro- vided the most feared and expensive legions in Europe.
The cantons, to eke out their income, leased their regiments to foreign
powers, and for a time “made Swiss valor an article of merchandise.” 9
Austri an overlords still claimed feudal rights in Switzerland, and
occasionally tried to enforce them; they were repulsed at Sempach (1386)
and Nafels (1388) in battles that merit some remembrance in the records
of democracy. In 1446 the Treaty of Constance once more confirmed the
formal allegiance of Switzerland to the Empire, and its actual
liberty.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>GERMANY CHALLENGES THE CHURCH</li>
</ol>
<p>Germany too was a federation, but its constituent parts were ruled
not by democratic assemblies but by secular or ecclesiastical princes
acknowl- edging only a limited fealty to the head of the Holy Roman
Empire. Some of these states — Bavaria, Wiirttemburg, Thuringia, Hesse,
Nassau, Meissen, Saxony, Brandenburg, Carinthia, Austria, and the
Palatinate — were ruled by dukes, counts, margraves, or other secular
lords; some — Magdeburg, Mainz, Halle, Bamberg, Cologne, Bremen,
Strasbourg, Salzburg, Trier, Basel, Hildesheim — were politically
subject in varying degrees to bishops or archbishops; but nearly a
hundred cities had by 1460 won charters of practical freedom from their
lay or church superiors. In each principality delegates of the three
estates — nobles, clergy, commons — met occasionally in a territorial
diet that exercised some restraint, through its power of the purse, on
the authority of the prince. Principalities and free cities sent repre-
sentatives to the Reichstag or Imperial Diet. A special Kurfiirstentag,
or Diet of Electors, was called to choose a king; normally it was
composed of the king of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of
Brandenburg, the count palatine, and the archbishops of Mainz, Trier,
and Cologne. Their choice created only a king, who became the
acknowledged head of the Holy Roman Empire when he was crowned emperor
by the pope; hence his pre- coronation title of “King of the Romans.” He
made his capital primarily in Nuremberg, often elsewhere, even in
Prague. His authority rested on</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>tradition and prestige rather than on possessions or force; he owned
no ter- ritory beyond his own domain as one feudal prince among many; he
was dependent upon the Reichstag or Kurfiirstentag for funds to
administer his government or to wage war; and this dependence condemned
even able men like Charles IV or Sigismund to humiliating failures in
foreign affairs. The destruction of the Hohenstaufen dynasty by the
powerful popes of the thirteenth century had fatally weakened the Holy
Roman Empire founded (a.d. 800) by Pope Leo III and Charlemagne. In 1400
it was a loose associa- tion of Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Holland, and
Switzerland.</p>
<p>The conflict between Empire and papacy revived when, on the same day
in 1314, two rival groups of electors chose Louis of Bavaria and
Frederick of Austria as rival kings. John XXII, from his papal seat at
Avignon, recog- nized both as kings, neither as emperor, and argued that
since only a pope could crown a king as emperor, he should be accepted
as judge of the valid- ity of the election; moreover, said the ambitious
pontiff, the administration of the Empire should belong to the papacy
between the death of an emperor and the coronation of his successor.
Louis and Frederick preferred the arbit- rament of war. At Miihldorf
(1322) Louis defeated and captured Frederick, and thenceforth assumed
full Imperial authority. John ordered him to re- sign all titles and
powers, and to appear before the papal court to receive sentence as a
rebel against the Church. Louis refusing, the Pope excom- municated him
(1324), bade all Christians in the Empire to resist his rule, and laid
an interdict upon any region that recognized him as king. Most of
Germany ignored these edicts, for the Germans, like the English, rated
the Avignon popes as servants or allies of France. In the progressive
weakening of faith and the papacy men were beginning to think of
themselves as patriots first and Christians afterward. Catholicism,
which is supernational, declined; nationalism, which is Protestant,
rose.</p>
<p>At this juncture Louis received aid and comfort from incongruous
allies. Pope John’s bull Cum inter nonnulla (1323) had branded as heresy
the - ciscans” who affirmed that view. Many friars retorted the charge
of heresy upon the Pope; they expressed holy horror at the wealth of the
Church; some of them called the aged pontiff Antichrist; and the general
of the Spirit- uals, Michael Cesena, led a large minority of them into
open alliance with Louis of Bavaria (1324). Emboldened by their support,
Louis issued at Sachsenhausen a manifesto agai nst “John XXII, who calls
himself pope”; denounced him as a man of blood and a friend of
injustice, who was resolved to destroy the Empire; and demanded that a
general council should try the Pope for heresy. 10</p>
<p>MIDDLE EUROPE</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>The King was further encouraged by the appearance, at his court
in</p>
<p>Nuremberg, of two professors from the University of Paris — Marsilius
of Padua and John of Jandun — whose book, Defensor Pads, attacked the
Avignon papacy in terms that must have pleased t he royal ears: “What do
you find there but a swarm of simoniacs from every quarter? What but the
clamor of pettifoggers, the . . . abuse of honorable men? There justice
to the innocent falls to the ground, unless they can buy it for a
price.” 11 Echoing the Albigensian and Waldensian preachers of the
thirteenth century, and anticipating Luther by two hundred years, the
authors argued that Chris- tianity should be based exclusively upon the
Bible. A general council of the Church should be summoned not by the
pope but by the emperor; the latter’s consent should be required for the
election of any pontiff; and the pope, like everybody else, should be
subject to the emperor.</p>
<p>Delighted to hear this, Louis decided to go to Italy and have
himself</p>
<p>crowned emperor by the people of Rome. Early in 1327 he set out with
a small army, some Franciscans, and the two philosophers whom he
employed to compose his public pronouncements. In April the Pope issued
new bulls, excommunicating John and Marsilius, and ordering Louis to
leave Italy. But Louis was welcomed into Milan by the ruling Visconti,
and received the iron crown as the formal sovereign of Lombardy. On
January 7, 1328, he entered Rome amid the acclamations of a populace
resentful of the papal residence in Avignon. He established himself in
the Vatican palace, and sum- moned a public assembly to meet at the
Capitol. To the multitude there he appeared as a candidate for
investiture with the Imperial crown. It gave its tumultuous consent; and
on January 17 the coveted diadem was placed upon his head by the old
syndic Sciarra Colonna — that same unrelenting foe of the papacy who,
almost a quarter of a century before, had fought and threatened with
death Boniface VIII, and who again symbolized for a mo- ment the
challenge of the rising state to the weakened Church.</p>
<p>Pope John, now seventy-eight, never dreamed of accepting defeat. He
proclaimed a holy crusade to depose Louis from all authority, and bade
the Romans, under pain of interdict, to expel him from their city and
return to the papal obedience. Louis replied in terms recalling his
excommunicated predecessor Henry IV; he convoked another popular
assembly, and in its presence issued an Imperial edict accusing the Pope
of heresy and tyranny, deposing him from ecclesiastical office, and
sentencing him to punishment by secular powers. A committee of Roman
clergy and laity, under his in- structions, named Peter of Corvara as a
rival pope. Reversing the roles of Leo III and Charlemagne, Louis placed
the papal tiara upon Peter’s head, and proclaimed him Pope Nicholas V
(May 12, 1328). The Christian world</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>(chap, vn</p>
<p>marveled, and divided into two camps, almost along the same lines
that would divide Europe after the Reformation.</p>
<p>Petty local events changed the situation dramatically. Louis had
ap-</p>
<p>pointed Marsilius of Padua spiritual administrator of the capital;
Marsilius ordered the few priests who remained in Rome to celebrate Mass
as usual, despite the interdict; some who refused were tortured; and an
Augus- tinian friar was exposed in a den of lions on the Capitol. 12
Many Romans felt that this was carrying philosophy too far. The Italians
had never learned to love Teutons; when some German soldiers took food
from the markets without paying for it, riots ensued. To support his
troops and retinue Louis needed money; he imposed a tribute of 10,000
florins (50,000?) upon the laity, and equal sums upon the clergy and the
Jews. Resentment mounted so dangerously that Louis thought it time to
return to Germany. On August 4, 1328, he began a retreat through Italy.
Papal troops took possession of Rome the next day; the palaces of
Louis’s Roman supporters were destroyed, and their goods were
confiscated to the Church. The people made no resistance, but returned
to their devotions and their crimes.</p>
<p>Louis was consoled at Pisa by receiving another recruit, the most
famous philosopher of the fourteenth century. William of Ockham had fled
from a papal prison in Avignon; now he offered his services to the
Emperor, saying (according to an unverified tradition), “Tu me defendas.
gladio, ego te de - fend am calamo”— “Defend me with the sword, and I
will defend you with the pen.” 13 He wrote vigorously, but he could not
save the situation. Louis had alienated all the ruling elements in
Italy. His Ghibelline adherents had hoped to rule the peninsula in his
name for their own good; they were chagrined to find him assuming all
the powers and perquisites of govern- ment; moreover, he made them levy
unpopular taxes for his exchequer. As his forces were ill proportioned
to his pretensions, many Ghibellines, even the Visconti, abandoned him
and made what peace they could with the Pope. The Antipope, left to his
own resources, submitted to arrest by papal officers, was led before
John XXII with a halter around his neck, threw him- self at the Pope’s
feet and begged for pardon (1328). John forgave him, embraced him as a
returned prodigal, and imprisoned him for life.</p>
<p>Louis returned to Germany, and sent repeated embassies to Avignon
offering recantations and apologies for papal pardon and recognition.
John refused, and fought on till his death (1334). Louis recovered some
ground when England, beginning the Hundred Years’ War, sought his
alliance; Edward III recognized Louis as Emperor, and Louis hailed
Edward as</p>
<p>King of France. Seizing the opportunity provided by this alliance of
two major powers against the papacy, an assembly of German princes and
pre- lates at Rense (July 16. 1338) proclaimed that the choice of a
German king</p>

<p>151</p>
<p>by the German electors could not be annulled by any other authority;
and a diet at Frankfurt-am-Main (August 3, 1338) declared the papal
pronounce- ments against Louis null and void; the Imperial title and
power, it ruled, were the gift of the Imperial electors, and needed no
confirmation by a pope. 14 Germany and England ignored the protests of
Pope Benedict XII, and moved a step toward the Reformation.</p>
<p>Reckless with success, Louis now decided to apply to the full the
theories of Marsilius, and to exercise ecclesiastical as well as secular
supremacy. He removed papal appointees from church benefices, and put
his own candi- dates in their place; he appropriated the funds that
papal collectors were raising for a crusade; he dissolved the marriage
of Margaret of Carinthia — heiress to much of Tyrol — and wedded her to
his own son, who was related to her by a degree of kinship canonically
invalidating marriage. The repudi- ated husband, his elder brother
Charles, and their father, King John of Bohemia, vowed vengeance; and
Clement VI, who had become pope in 1342, saw an opportunity to unseat
the aging enemy of the Papal See. Skill- ful diplomacy won elector after
elector to the view that peace and order could be restored in the Empire
only by deposing Louis and making Charles of Bohemia emperor; and
Charles, as the price of papal support, pledged obedience to papal
commands. In July 1346, an electoral diet at Rense unanimously declared
Charles to be King of Germany. Louis, having failed to secure a hearing
at Avignon for his offers of submission, prepared to fight to the death
for his throne. Meanwhile, aged sixty, he hunted vigorously, fell from
his horse, and was killed (1347).</p>
<p>Charles IV, as King and Emperor, governed well. The Germans disliked
him because he made .Prague the Imperial capital; but in Germany as well
as in his homeland he improved administration, protected commerce and
transport, reduced tolls, and maintained an honest currency; and to the
whole Empire he gave a generation of comparative peace. In 1356 he
acquired equivocal fame in history by issuing a series of regulations
known as the Golden Bull — though they were only a few of many documents
bear- ing the Imperial golden seal. Perhaps convinced that his long
absence from Germany necessitated such an arrangement, he granted to the
seven electors such powers as almost annulled the Imperial authority.
The electors were to meet annually to legislate for the realm; the king
or emperor was to be merely their president and executive arm. They
themselves in their own states were to enjoy full judiciary power,
ownership of all minerals and metals in the soil, the right to mint
their own coinages, to raise revenue, and, within limits, to make war
and peace. The Bull gave its legal sanction to existing facts, and tried
to build upon them a co-operative federation of orincioalities. The
electors, however, absorbed themselves in their regional</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>1 52</p>
<p>(chap, vn</p>
<p>affairs, and so neglected their responsibilities as an Imperial
council that Ger- many remained only a name. This local independence of
the electors made possible the protection of Luther by the Elector of
Saxony, and the conse- quent spread of the Protestant faith.</p>
<p>In his old age Charles secured the Imperial succession for his son by
whole- sale bribery (1378). Wenceslaus IV had some virtues, but he loved
alcohol and his native land; the electors resented his tastes, and
deposed him ( 1400) in favor of Rupert III, who left no trace on
history. Sigismund of Luxem- bourg had at the age of nineteen been
chosen King of Hungary (1387); in 1411 he was elected King of the
Romans, and soon assumed the title of emperor. He was a man of varied
accomplishments and personal charm, handsome and vain, generous and
amiable, occasionally cruel; he learned several languages and loved
literature only next to women and power. His good intentions might have
paved a small inferno, but his courage failed him in crisis. He tried
honorably to reform the abuses and weaknesses of the German government;
he passed some excellent laws, and enforced a few of them; but he was
frustrated by the autonomy and inertia of the electors, and their
unwillingness to share in the cost of checking the advancing Turks. In
his later years he consumed his funds and energies in fighting the Hus-
sites of Bohemia. When he died (1437) Europe mourned that one who for a
time had been the voice of European progress had failed in everything
but dignity.</p>
<p>He had commended his son-in-law, Albert of Hapsburg, to the electors
of Bohemia, Hungary, and Germany. Albert II graced the three crowns, but
before his abilities could bear fruit he died of dysentery in a campaign
against the Turks (1440). He left no son, but the electors voted the
royal and Imperial crowns to another Hapsburg, Frederick of Styria;
thereafter their choice fell repeatedly to a Hapsburg prince, and the
Imperial power became in effect the hereditary possession of that
talented and ambitious family. Frederick III made Austria an archduchy;
the Hapsburgs made Vienna their capital; the heir presumptive was
regularly the archduke of Austria; and the genial quality of the
Austrian and Viennese character en- tered like a graceful feminine theme
to cross with the brusque masculinity of the north in the Teutonic
soul.</p>

<li>THE MYSTICS</li>
</ol>
<p>The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries sowed the seeds of the
Reforma- tion: Louis of Bavaria, Wyclif in England, Huss in Bohemia,
rehearsed the play for Luther, Henry VIII, Calvin, and Knox. In
Scandinavia the rapidly</p>
<p>MIDDLE EUROPE</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>rising wealth of the clergy, exempt from taxation, became an
irritating bur- den to the people and the state. Critics alleged that
the Church owned half the land of Denmark, holding a fief on Copenhagen
itself. 19 Nobles looked with ominous envy upon possessions protected by
only a creed; and even the orthodox were anticlerical. In Switzerland
the proud independence of the cantons was a prelude to Zwingli and
Calvin. In 1433 Magdeburg expelled her archbishop and clergy; Bamberg
revolted against episcopal rule; Passau besieged her bishop in his
citadel. 10 In 1449 a professor in the Uni- versity of Erfurt (where
Luther was to study) addressed to Pope Nicholas V a defense of general
councils as superior in authority to the popes. 17 Echoes of the Hussite
revolt in neighboring Bohemia spread through Ger- many; here and there
Waldensian congregations furtively preserved old heresies and
semi-communistic aspirations. 18 Piety itself tended toward a mysticism
that hovered near heresy.</p>
<p>In Johannes Eckhart mysticism became a pantheism that by-passed the
Church and almost ignored the defined creed. This Dominican friar was so
learned that the title Meister became part of his name. His
philosophical writings were phrased in such scholastic Latin that had
these been his sole works he would never have come to any harm or fame.
But in his monastery at Cologne he preached in epigrammatic German the
audacious pantheism that invited the Inquisition. Following Dionysius
the Areopagite and Johannes Scotus Erigena, he struggled to express his
overwhelming sense of an omnipresent God. This all-bathing ocean of
deity Eckhart conceived as not a person or a spirit, but only “absolute
bare unity . . . the abyss, with - out a mode and without form, of the
silent and waste divinity . . . where never was seen difference, neither
Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost, where there is no one at home, yet where
the spark of the soul is more at peace than within itself.” 19
Essentially only this formless divinity exists.</p>
<p>God is all things, all things are God. The Father begets me, His
son,</p>
<p>without cease. I say more: He begets in me Himself, and in
Himself</p>
<p>me. The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God</p>
<p>sees me. . . . My eye and God’s eye are one eye . 20</p>
<p>In each individual there is a fragment of God; through it we can
communi- cate directly with Him, and can identify ourselves with Him.
Not through church ritual, not even through the Bible, but through this
cosmic con- sciousness alone the soul can approach and see God. The more
one renounces individual and worldly aims, the clearer and more
farseeing this divine spark becomes, until at last God and soul are one,
and “we are totally transformed into God.” 21 Heaven, purgatory, and
hell are not plac es; they are states of the soul: separation from God
is hell, union with Him is paradise. 22 Some of these propositions
smelled of heresy to the Archbishop of Cologne. He sum-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>*54</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>moned Eckhart to trial (1326); Eckhart affirmed his docile orthodoxy,
and proposed that his statements should be viewed as literary
hyperboles. The bishop condemned him nevertheless. The friar appealed to
Pope John XXII, and then escaped the faggots by a timely death
(1327).</p>
<p>His influence was spread by two Dominican pupils who knew how to keep
his pantheism within safe bounds. Heinrich Suso tortured himself for
sixteen years with ascetic austerities, cut the name of Jesus into his
flesh over his heart, claimed to have received into his mouth blood from
the wounds of Christ, and wrote his Little Book of Eternal Wisdom in
German because, he said, it was in German that God had revealed it to
him. 23 Johannes Tauler called Eckhart his “most holy Master,” and
preached at Strasbourg and Basel the doctrine of mystic union with God.
It was to Tauler that Luther ascribed a book, Deutsche Theologie, which
moved him deeply with its simple creed: God, Christ, and
immortality.</p>
<p>The Church looked with some concern upon mystics who ignored most of
her dogmas, neglected her ritual, and claimed to reach God without the
help of priests or sacraments. Here lay in germ the Reformation
doctrines of private judgment, and every man a priest, and justification
not by good works but by transcendent faith. The Church held that
supernatural revela- tions could come from demons and maniacs as well as
from God and the saints, and that some authoritative guidance was needed
to keep religion from disintegrating into a chaos of individual visions
and theologies. That difference of view still divides honest men.</p>
<p>V. THE ARTS</p>
<p>The Gothic style lingered in Germany long after it had given way, in
Italy and France, to the classic influences of the Renaissance. Now it
crowned the thriving cities of Central Europe with churches not as
overpowering in grandeur as the great shrines of France, yet lifting the
spirit with a quiet beauty and unpre- tentious dignity. Uppsala began
its cathedral in 1287, Saxon Freiberg in 1283, Ulm in 1377 (with the
highest Gothic tower in the world), Vienna its Stefans- dom in 1304,
Stralsund its Marienkirche in 1382, Danzig another Marienkirche in 1425.
Aachen and Cologne added the choirs of their cathedrals, Strasbourg
completed the “frozen music” of its cathedral in 1439; Xanten built a
graceful Collegiate Church of St. Victor, which was destroyed in the
second World War. Nuremberg gloried in four famous churches that gave
piety a schooling in art and taste. The Lorenzkirche (1278 — 1477) owed
to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries its stately portal and
resplendent rose. The Stefansdom, or Cathedral of St. Stephen (1304 —
1476), was a beloved landmark; its steep roof covered nave and aisles in
a single span, and fell to Mars in 1945* About 1309 the Sebal -
duskirche rebuilt its aisles; in 1361 it raised a new choir; about 1498
it completed</p>
<p>MIDDLE EUROPE</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>its western towers; from 1360 to 1510 it installed magnificent
stained glass. The Frauenkirche, or Church of Our Lady (1355-61), with
its richly sculptured vestibule, was almost demolished in the second
World War, but is already re- stored; and every day at noon the four
manikin electors in the famous clock of the fagade bow to Charles IV in
untiring acknowledgment of his famous Bull. Sculpture was still crude,
but churches in Breslau and Hallgarten, and the Sebalduskirche in
Nuremberg, received stone or wood Madonnas of some nobility.</p>
<p>The cities beautified not only their churches but their public
buildings, their shops, and their homes. Now rose those gabled and
half-timbered houses that give the German towns a wistful medieval charm
for idealizing modem eyes. The Rathaus, or Council Hall, was the center
of civic life, sometimes also the rendezvous of the greater guilds; its
walls might bear frescoes, and its woodwork was usually carved with
Teutonic fullness and strength. The Grosse Saal of the Rathaus at Bremen
( 1410-50) had a ceiling of carved beams, a winding staircase with posts
and railing of carved wood, and gaudy chandeliers in the shape of ships.
The Rathaus of Cologne (1360-1571), which had seated the first general
convocation of the Hanseatic League; of Munster (1335), where the Treaty
of Westphalia was signed; of Brunswick, a fourteenth-century gem of
civic Gothic; of Frankfurt-am-Main ( 1405), where the electors dined a
newly chosen emperor: all were destroyed in the second World War. In
Marienburg the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Order built their massive
Deutschordenschloss (1309-80). In Nuremberg the Rathaus confronted the
Sebalduskirche; it was built (1340) to hold the fully assembled
Reichstag of the Empire; half a dozen restorations have left little of
its medieval form. In the market place before the Frauenkirche a Prague
sculptor, Heinrich Parler, raised the Schoner Brunnen, or Beautiful
Fountain (1361 f.), crowded with statues of pagan, Jewish, and Christian
heroes. With its sculptures, churches, and secular architecture
Nuremberg, in the three centuries between 1250 and 1550, represented the
German spirit at its highest and best. The meandering streets were
mostly narrow and unpaved; yet the future Pope Pius II wrote of
Nuremberg:</p>
<p>When one comes from Lower Franconia and perceives this glorious</p>
<p>city, its splendor seems truly magnificent. Entering it, one’s
original</p>
<p>impression is confirmed by the beauty of the streets and the fitness
of the houses. The churches . . . are worthy of worship as well as of
ad- miration. The imperial castle proudly dominates the town, and
the</p>
<p>burghers’ dwellings seem to have been built for princes. In truth the
kings of Scotland would gladly be housed so luxuriously as the com- mon
citizen of Nuremberg. 24</p>
<p>In the German cities the industrial and minor arts — in wood, ivory,
copper, bronze, iron, silver, gold — reached now the full ripening of
their medieval growth. Artists and weavers composed amazing tapestries;
the wood engravers prepared for Diirer and Holbein; the miniaturists
illuminated fine manuscripts on the eve of Gutenberg; woodworkers carved
gorgeous furniture; and the metal founders</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>cast for the churches, in the fifteenth century, bells whose beauty
of tone has never been surpassed. Music was not merely an art; it was
half the leisure life of the towns. Nuremberg and other cities staged
great carnivals of popular drama and song. The Volkslied expressed the
pious or amorous sentiments of the peo- ple. The middle classes made a
mass attack upon the problems of polyphony; the guilds competed in
gigantic choruses; butchers, tanners, bell casters, and other mighty men
contested the Meistersinger prize in tumultuous vocal tournaments. The
first famous school of Meistersinger was established at Mainz in 1 3 1 1
; others rose at Strasbourg, Frankfurt-am-Main, Wurzburg, Zurich,
Augsburg, Nurem- berg, and Prague. Students who passed through the four
degrees of Schuler , Schulfreund , Dichter, and Saenger (scholar, friend
of the school, poet, and singer) earned the title of Meister. The
romantic and idealistic strain of the min- nesingers was brought to
earth as the German burghers tied their lusty realism to the wings of
song.</p>
<p>Since the business class dominated the cities, all the arts except
church architec- ture took a realistic turn. The climate was cold and
often wet, discouraging nudity; the pride and cult of the body did not
find a congenial home here as in Renaissance Italy or ancient Greece.
When Konrad Witz of Constance painted Solomon and the Queen of Sheba he
dressed them as if for a winter in the Alps. A dozen cities, however,
had schools of painting in the fifteenth century — Ulm, Salzburg,
Wurzburg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Munich, Darmstadt, Basel, Aachen,
Nuremberg, Hamburg, Colmar, Cologne; and samples survive from all of
them. We read in a chronicle of 1380: “There was in Cologne at this time
a famous painter named Wilhelm, whose like could not be found in all the
land. He portrayed men so cunningly that it seemed they were alive.” 25
Meister Wilhelm was one of many “primitives”— Meister Bertram, Meister
Francke, The Master of St. Veronica, The Master of the Heisterbacher
Altar — who, chiefly under Flemish influence, created a discipline of
mural painting in Germany, and suf- fused the traditional Gospel themes
with an emotional piety traceable, it may be, to Eckhart and the other
German mystics.</p>
<p>In Stephen Lochner, who died at Cologne in 1451, this preliminary
develop- ment ends, and we reach the zenith of the early school. His
Adoration of the Magi, now a prize of the Cologne Cathedral, can bear
comparison with most paintings produced before the middle of the
fifteenth century: a lovely Virgin at once modest and proud, a
delightful Infant, the Wise Men of the East very German but credibly
wise, the composition orthodox, the coloring bright with blue and green
and gold. In The Virgin of the Rose Trellis and The Madonna of the
Violet, ideal young German mothers, of a soft and pensive beauty, are
portrayed with all the technical resources of a medieval art visibly
moving toward modernity. Germany was on the threshold of its greatest
age.</p>

<p>renascent Europe with Islam; the disillusioning capture of

of commerce through the voyages of Henry the Navigator’s fleet, and
Columbus, and Vasco da Gama; the rise of the business class, which

of national states challenging the supernational authority of the popes;
the successful revolt of Luther against the papacy; printing.</p>
<p>Before Gutenberg nearly all education had been in the hands of the
Church. Books were costly; copying was laborious and sometimes careless.
Few authors could reach a wide audience until they were dead; they had
to live by pedagogy, or by entering a monastic order, or by pensions
from the rich or benefices from the Church. They received little or no
payment from those who published their works; and even if one publisher
paid them they had no copyright protection, except occasionally by a
papal grant. Libraries were numerous but small; monasteries, cathedrals,
colleges, and some cities had modest collections, seldom more than 300
volumes; the books were usually kept inside the walls, and some were
chained to lecterns or desks. Charles V of France had a library renowned
for its size — 910 volumes; Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, had 600; the
library of Christ Church Priory at Canterbury was probably as large as
any outside of Islam, having some 2,000 volumes in 1 300. The best
publicized library in England was that of Richard de Bury St. Edmunds,
who wrote affectionately of his books in The Philo biblon (1345), and
made them complain of their maltreatment by “that two - legged beast
called woman,” who insisted on exchanging them for fine linen or silk.
26</p>
<p>As schools multiplied and literacy rose, the demand for books
increased. The business classes found literacy useful in the operations
of industry and trade; women of the middle and upper classes escaped,
through reading, into a world of compensatory romance; by 1300 the time
had passed when only the clergy could read. It was this rising demand,
even more than the in- creased supply of paper and the development of an
oily ink, 27 that led to Gutenberg. Moslems had brought paper
manufacture to Spain in the tenth century, to Sicily in the twelfth; it
passed into Italy in the thirteenth, into France in the fourteenth; the
paper industry was a hundred years old in Europe when printing came. In
the fourteenth century, when linen clothing became customary in Europe,
castoff linens provided cheap rags for paper; the cost of paper
declined, and its readier availability co-operated with the extension of
literacy to offer a material and market for printed books.</p>
<p>Printing itself, as imprinting, was older than Christianity. The
Babyloni- ans had printed letters or symbols upon bricks, the Romans and
many others upon coins, potters upon their wares, weavers upon cloths,
bookbinders upon book covers; any ancient or medieval dignitary used
printing when he</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>I 5 8</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>stamped documents with his seal. Similar methods had been employed in
the production of maps and playing cards. Block printing — by blocks of
wood or metal engraved with words, symbols, or images — goes back in
China and Japan to the eighth century, probably beyond; the Chinese in
this way printed paper money in or before the tenth century. Block
printing appeared in Tabriz in 1294, in Egypt toward 1300; but the
Moslems pre- ferred calligraphy to printing, and did not serve in this
case, as in so many others, to carry cultural developments from the East
to the West.</p>
<p>Typography — printing with separate and movable type for each charac-
ter or letter — was used in China as early as 1041. In 1314 Wang Chen
em- ployed nearly 60,000 movable wooden type characters to print a book
on agriculture; 28 he had tried metal type first, but had found that it
did not take or hold ink as readily as wood. Movable type, however,
offered little advan- tage or convenience to a language that had no
alphabet, but had 40,000 separate characters; consequently block
printing remained customary in China till the nineteenth century. In
1403 a Korean emperor printed a large number of volumes from movable
metal type; characters were engraved in hard wood, molds of porcelain
paste were made from these models, and in these molds metal type were
cast.</p>
<p>In Europe printing from movable type may have developed first in Hol-
land; according to Dutch traditions not traceable beyond 1569, Laurens
Coster of Haarlem printed a religious manual from movable metal type in
1430; but the evidence is inconclusive. 29 Nothing further is heard of
movable type in Holland till 1473, when Germans from Cologne set up a
press in Utrecht. But these men had learned the art in Mainz.</p>
<p>Johann Gutenberg was bom there of a prosperous family about 1400. His
father’s name was Gensfleisch— Gooseflesh; Johann preferred his mother’s
maiden name. He lived most of his first forty years in Strasbourg, and
ap- pears to have made experiments there in cutting and casting metal
type. To- ward 1448 he became a citizen of Mainz. On August 22, 1450, he
entered into a contract with Johann Fust, a rich goldsmith, by which he
mortgaged his printing press to Fust for a loan of 800 guilders, later
raised to 1 ,600. A letter of indulgence issued by Nicholas V in 1451
was probably printed by Gutenberg; several copies exist, bearing the
oldest printed date, 1454. 80 In 1455 Fust sued Gutenberg for repayment;
unable to comply, Gutenberg surrendered his press. Fust carried on the
establishment with Peter Schoffer, who had been employed by Gutenberg as
typesetter. Some believe that it was Schoffer who had by this time
developed the new tools and technique of printing: a hard “punch” of
engraved steel for each letter, number, and punctuation mark, a metal
matrix to receive the punches, and a metal mold to hold the matrix and
letters in line.</p>
<p>In 1456 Gutenberg, with borrowed funds, set up another press. From
this</p>
<p>MIDDLE EUROPE</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>he issued, in that year or the next, what has been generally
considered his first type- printed book, the famous and beautiful
“Gutenberg Bible” a majestic folio of 1,282 large double-columned pages.
In 1462 Mainz was sacked by the troops of Adolf of Nassau; the printers
fled, scattering the new art through Germany. By 1463 there were
printers in Strasbourg, Cologne, Basel, Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Ulm.
Gutenberg, one of the fugitives, settled in Eltville, where he resumed
his printing. He struggled painfully through one financial crisis after
another, until Adolf gave him (1465) a benefice yielding a protective
income. Some three years later he died.</p>
<p>Doubtless his use of movable type would have been developed by others
had he never been born; it was an obvious demand of the times; this is
true of most inventions. A letter written in 1470 by Guillaume Fichet of
Paris suggests how enthusiastically the invention was welcomed: “There
has been discovered in Germany a wonderful new method for the production
of books, and those who have mastered the art are taking it from Mainz
out into the world. . . . The light of this discovery will spread from
Germany to all parts of the earth.” 31 But not all welcomed it. Copyists
protested that printing would destroy their means of livelihood;
aristocrats opposed it as a mechanical vulgarization, and feared that it
would lower the value of their manuscript libraries; statesmen and
clergy distrusted it as a possible vehicle of subversive ideas. It made
its triumphant way nevertheless. In 1464 two Germans set up a press in
Rome; in or before 1469 two Germans opened a printing shop in Venice; in
1470 three Germans brought the art to Paris; in 1471 it reached Holland,
in 1472 Switzerland, in 1473 Hungary, in 1474 Spain, in 1476 England, in
1482 Denmark, in 1483 Sweden, in 1490 Constan- tinople. Nuremberg with
the Koberger family, Paris with the Etiennes, Ly- ons with Dolet, Venice
with Aldus Manutius, Basel with Amerbach and Froben, Zurich with
Froschauer, Leiden with the Elzevirs, became humming hives of printing
and publishing. Soon half the European population was reading as never
before, and a passion for books became one of the efferves- cent
ingredients of the Reformation age. “At this very moment,” writes a
Basel scholar to a friend, “a whole wagon load of classics, of the best
Aldine editions, has arrived from Venice. Do you want any? If you do,
tell me at once, and send the money, for no sooner is such a freight
landed than thirty buyers rise up for each volume, merely asking the
price, and tearing one an- other’s eyes out to get hold of them.” 32 The
typographical revolution was on.</p>
<p>To describe all its effects would be to chronicle half the history of
the</p>
<p>• Also known as the “Mazarin Bible,” because it was discovered about
1760 in the library left by that cardinal. Forty-six copies survive. The
Morgan Library of New York in 1953 paid 5,000 to a Swiss monastery for a
“Constance Missal” which it believes was printed by Gutenberg before the
Bible, probably in 1452.</p>
<p>l6o THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. VII</p>
<p>modem mind. Erasmus, in the ecstasy of his sales, called printing the
greatest of all discoveries, but perhaps he underestimated speech, fire,
the wheel, agri- culture, writing, law, even the lowly common noun.
Printing replaced eso- teric manuscripts with inexpensive texts rapidly
multiplied, in copies more exact and legible than before, and so uniform
that scholars in diverse coun- tries could work with one another by
references to specific pages of specific editions. Quality was often
sacrificed to quantity, but the earliest printed books were in many
cases models of art in typography and binding. Printing published —
i.e., made available to the public — cheap manuals of instruction in
religion, literature, history, and science; it became the greatest and
cheap- est of all universities, open to all. It did not produce the
Renaissance, but it paved the way for the Enlightenment, for the
American and French revolu - tions, for democracy. It made the Bible a
common possession, and prepared the people for Luther’s appeal from the
popes to the Gospels; later it would permit th e rationalist’s appeal
from the Gospels to reason. It ended the clerical monopoly of learning,
the priestly control of education. It encour- aged the vernacular
literatures, for the large audience it required could not be reached
through Latin. It facilitated the international communication and
co-operation of scientists. It affected the quality and character of
litera- ture by subjecting authors to the purse and taste of the middle
classes rather than to aristocratic or ecclesiastical patrons. And,
after speech, it provided a readier instrument for the dissemination of
nonsense than the world has ever known until our time.</p>
