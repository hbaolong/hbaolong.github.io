<h4 id="chapter-xvii">CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<p>The Social Revolution</p>
<p>i5 22 -3 6</p>
<p>I. THE MOUNTING REVOLT: 1 52 2-24</p>
<p>T HE famished knights had waited impatiently for a chance to rise</p>
<p>against princes, prelates, and financiers. In 1522 Charles V was
far</p>
<p>away in Spain; Sickingen’s troops were fretful ly idle; rich Church
lands lay open to easy seizure. Hutten was calling for action. Luther
had invited the German people to sweep their oppressors from the
earth.</p>
<p>On August 1 3 a number of knights signed at Landau a pledge of united
action. Sickingen besieged Trier, and shot letters into it inviting the
people to join him in overthrowing the ruling archbishop; they remained
quiet. The archbishop gathered troops, played general, and beat back
five assaults. Sickingen raised the siege and retired to his castle at
Landstuhl. The arch- bishop, with help from neighboring princes, stormed
the castle; Sickingen was mortally wounded in its defense; on May 6,
1523, he surrendered; on May 7 he died. The knights submitted to the
princes, disbanded their private armies, and clung with desperate
severity to the peasant feudal dues that were their main support.</p>
<p>Foreseeing this debacle, Luther had dissociated himself, none too
soon (December 19, 1522), from the revolt. Otherwise his star continued
to ascend . “The cause of Luther,” wrote Archduke Ferdinand to his
brother the Emperor (1522), “is so deeply rooted in the whole Empire
that not one person in a thousand is free from it.” 1 Monks and priests
were flocking to the new altar of matrimony. At Nuremberg the
Lorenzkirche and the Sebalduskirche resounded with “God’s Word”— the
Reformers’ phrase for a faith based solely on the Bible. “Evangelical”
preachers moved freely through northern Germany, capturing old pulpits
and setting up new ones; and they denounced not only popes and bishops
as “servants of Lucifer,” but secular lords as “iniquitous oppressors.”
2 However, secular lords were themselves converts: Philip of Hesse,
Casimir of Brandenburg, Ulrich of Wiir ttemberg, Ernest of Liineberg,
John of Saxony. Even the Emperor’s sister Isabella was a Lutheran.</p>
<p>Charles’s old teacher had now become Pope Adrian VI (1521). To a</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION 38 1</p>
<p>Diet at Nuremberg (1522) he sent a dem and for Luther’s arrest, and a
candid confession of ecclesiastical faults:</p>
<p>We know well that for many years things deserving of abhorrence</p>
<p>have gathered round the Holy See. Sacred things have been misused,
ordinances transgressed, so that in everything there has been a change
for the worse. Thus it is not surprising that the malady has crept</p>
<p>down from the head to the members, from the popes to the hier-</p>
<p>archy. We all, prelates and clergy, have gone astray from the
right</p>
<p>way, and for long there is no one that has done good, no, not
one.</p>
<p>. . . Therefore … we shall use all diligence to reform before all
else</p>
<p>the Roman Curia, whence perhaps all these evils have had their</p>
<p>origin. . . . The whole world is longing for such reform. 3</p>
<p>The assembly agreed to ask Elector Frederick to check Luther, but it
asked why Luther should be condemned for pointing out clerical abuses
now so authoritatively confirmed. Finding the Pope’s confession insuffi
- ciently detailed, it sent him its own list of one hundred gravamina of
Ger- many against the Church, and proposed that these grievances should
be considered and remedied by a national council to be held in Germany
under the presidency of the Emperor.</p>
<p>The same Diet, dominated by the nobility, gave a sympathetic hearing
to charges that monopolists were enriching themselves at the expense of
the people. A committee wrote to the major cities of Germany asking
their advice as to whether the monopolies were harmful, and should they
be regulated or destroyed. Ulm replied that they were an evil, and that
business firms should be limited to a father, his son, and his
son-in-law. Augsburg, home of the Fuggers, submitted a classic defense
of “big business,” laissez faire, and widows and orphans:</p>
<p>Christendom (or shall we say the whole world?) is rich because</p>
<p>of business. The more business a country does, the more prosperous
are its people. . . . Where there are many merchants there is plenty</p>
<p>of work. … It is impossible to limit the size of the companies. . .
.</p>
<p>The bigger and more numerous they are, the better for everybody.</p>
<p>If a merchant is not perfectly free to do business in Germany he
will</p>
<p>go elsewhere, to Germany’s loss If he cannot do business above a</p>
<p>certain amount, what is he to do with his surplus money? … It</p>
<p>would be well to let the merchant alone, and put no restrictions
on</p>
<p>his ability or capital. Some people talk of limiting the earning
capacity of investments. This would . . . work great injustice and harm
by</p>
<p>taking away the livelihood of widows, orphans, and other
sufferers</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>‘ who derive their income from investments in these companies.

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Diet legislated that companies should not be capitalized above
50,000 guilders; that profits must be distributed every two years, and
public ac-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>382</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>counting made; that money should not be loaned at usurious rates;
that no merchant should buy more than a stated maximum of any commodity
in any quarter-year; and that prices should be fixed by law. The
merchants appealed to Charles V; he supported them for reasons that have
been stated; and as many city magistrates shared in the profits of the
monopolies, the edicts of Nuremberg soon became a dead letter.</p>
<p>To a later session of the Diet (January 1524) a new pope, Clement
VII, sent Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio with fresh demands for the arrest
of Luther. Crowds jeered the nuncio in Augsburg; he had to enter
Nuremberg secretly to avoid hostile demonstrations; and he had the
humiliation of see- ing 3,000 persons, including the Emperor’s sister,
receive the Eucharist in both kinds from a Lutheran pastor. He warned
the Diet that the religious revolt, if not soon suppressed, would soon
undermine civil authority and order; but the Diet replied that any
attempt to put down Lutheranism by force would result in “riot,
disobedience, slaughter . . . and a general ruin.” 5 While the
deliberations proceeded the social revolution began.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PE ASANTS’ WAR: 1 5 24 -26</li>
</ol>
<p>The religious revolt offered the tillers of the fields a captivating
ideology in which to phrase their demands for a larger share in
Germany’s growing prosperity. The hardships that had already spurred a
dozen rural outbreaks still agitated the peasant mind, and indeed with
feverish intensity now that Luther had defied the Church, berated the
princes, broken the dams of disci- pline and awe, made every man a
priest, and proclaimed the freedom of the Christian man. In the Germany
of that age Church and state were so closely meshed — clergymen played
so large a role in social order and civil adminis- tration — that the
collapse of ecclesiastical prestige and power removed a main barrier to
revolution. The Waldensians, Beghards, Brethren of the Common Life, had
continued an old tradition of basing radical proposals upon Biblical
texts. The circulation of the New Testament in print was a blow to
political as well as to religious orthodoxy. It exposed the compro-
mises that the secular clergy had made with the nature of man and the
ways of the world; it revealed the communism of the Apostles, the
sympathy of Christ for the poor and oppressed; in these respects the New
Testament was for the radicals of this age a veritable Communist
Manifesto. Peasant and proletarian alike found in it a divine warrant
for dreaming of a utopia where private property would be abolished, and
the poor would inherit the earth.</p>
<p>In 152 1 a pamp hlet circulated in Germany under the title of
“Karsthans” — i.e., Pitchfork John. This “Man with the Hoe” and a pen
pledged peasant protection to Luther; and a continuation published in
the same year advo-</p>
<p>CHAP, xvn) the social revolution 383</p>
<p>cated a rural insurrection against the Catholic clergy. 8 Another
pamphlet of 1521, by Johannes Eberlin, demanded universal male suffrage,
the subordi- nation of every ruler and official to popularly elected
councils, the abolition of all capitalist organizations, a return to
medieval price-fixing for bread and wine, and the education of all
children in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, astron- omy, and medicine. 7 In 1522 a
pamphlet entitled “The Needs of the Ger - man Nation” (Teutscher Nation
Notturft), and falsely ascribed to the dead Emperor Frederick III,
called for the removal of “all tolls, duties, passports, and fines,” the
abolition of Roman and canon law, the limitation of business
organizations to a capital of 10,000 guilders, the exclusion of the
clergy from civil government, the confiscation of monastic wealth, and
the distribution of the proceeds among the poor. 8 Otto Brunfels
proclaimed (1524) that the payment of tithes to the clergy was contrary
to the New Testament. Preach- ers mingled Protestant evangelism with
utopian aspirations. One revealed that heaven was open to peasants but
closed to nobles and clergymen; an- other counseled the peasants to give
no more money to priests or monks; Miinzer, Carlstadt, and Hubmaier
advised their hearers that “farmers, miners, and cornthreshers
understand the Gospel better, and can teach it better, than a whole
village … of abbots and priests … or doctors of divin- ity”; Carlstadt
added, “and better than Luther.” 9 Almanacs and astrologers, as if
giving a cue to action, predicted an uprising for 1524. A Catholic hu-
manist, Johannes Cochlaeus, warned Luther (1523) that “the populace in
the towns, and the peasants in the provinces, will inevitably rise in
rebel- lion. . . . They are poisoned by the innumerable abusive
pamphlets and speeches that are printed and declaimed among them against
both papal and secular authority.” 10 Luther, the preachers, and the
pamphleteers wer e not the cause of the revolt; the causes were the just
grievances of the peasantry. But it could be argued that the gospel of
Luther and his more radical fol- lowers “poured oil on the flames,” 11
and turned the resentment of the op - pressed into utopian delusions,
uncalculated violence, and passionate revenge.</p>
<p>Thomas Miinzer’s career caught all the excitement of the time.
Appointed preacher at Allstedt (1522), he demanded the extermination of
the “god - less”— i.e., the orthodox or the conservative — by the sword;
“the godless have no right to live except in so far as they are
permitted to do so by the elect.” 12 He proposed to the princes that
they should lead the people in a communistic revolt against the clergy
and the capitalists. When the princes did not rise to the opportunity,
he called upon the people to overthrow the princes too, and “to
establish a refined society such as was contemplated by Plato , . . and
Apuleius of The Golden Ass.” 13 “All things are in com - mon,” he wrote,
“and should be distributed as occasion requires, according to the
several necessities of all. Any prince, count, or baron who, after
being</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>384</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>earnestly reminded of this truth, shall be unwilling to accept it, is
to be beheaded or hanged.” 14 Elector Frederick tolerated this gospel
humorously, but his brother Duke John and his cousin Duke George joined
with Luther in having Miinzer expelled from his pastorate ( 1524) - The
irate apostle wan- dered from town to town, announcing the deliverance
of “Israel,” and the</p>
<p>He found a congenial political climate in the free city of
Miihlhausen in Thuringia, where the textile industry had gathered a
numerous proletariat. Heinrich Pfeiffer, an ex-monk, had already begun
there, with the support of the lower middle class, a movement to capture
the municipal council from the patrician oligarchy. Miinzer preached his
radical program to the work- ingmen of the town and to the neighboring
peasantry. On March 17, 1525, the armed followers of Pfeiffer and
Miinzer deposed the patricians and set up an “Eternal Council” to rule
Miihlhausen. According to Me lanchthon the victorious radicals drove out
the monks, and appropriated all the prop- erty of the Church; 16
however, no theologian in this age could be trusted to report
impartially the activities or views of his opponents. No communist
commonwealth was established; Pfeiffer proved abler in practice than
Miinzer, and tamed the revolt to the needs of the middle class.
Anticipating attack by Imperial troops, Miinzer organized workers and
peasants into an army, and had heavy artillery cast for it in the
monastery of the Barefoot Friars. “Forward!” was his call to his men;
“forward while the fire is hot! Let your swords be ever warm with
blood!” 17</p>
<p>About the same time peasant uprisings were convulsing South Germany.
Perhaps a ruinous hailstorm (1524), which destroyed all hopes for a
harvest in Stiihlingen, served as the trigger of revolt. This district,
near Schaff- hausen, was not too far from Switzerland to feel the
example of the sturdy peasants who had there freed themselves from all
but the formalities of feudal power. On August 24, 1524, Hans Muller,
acting on a suggestion from Miinzer, gathered about him some Stiihlingen
peasants, and bound them into an “Evangelical Brotherhood” pledged to
emancipate farmers throughout Germany. Soon they were joined by the
discontented tenants of the abbot of Reichenau, the bishop of Constance,
the counts of Werden- burg, Montfort, Lupfen, and Sulz. By the end of
1524 there were some 30,000 peasants in arms in South Germany refusing
to pay state taxes, church tithes, or feudal dues, and sworn to
emancipation or death. At Memmingen their delegates, under the guidance
or influence of Zwinglian Protestants from Zurich, formulated (Marc h
1525) the “Twelve Articles” that set half of Germany on fire.</p>
<p>To the Christian reader peace, and the grace of God through</p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIl) THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>There are many anti-Christians who have lately taken occasion of</p>
<p>the assembly of the peasants to cast scorn upon the Gospel, saying,
Is this the fruit of the new evangel? Is no one to be obedient, but all
are to rebel … to overthrow, or perhaps to slay, the spiritual and</p>
<p>temporal lords? To all these godless and wicked critics the following
articles make answer, in order, first, to remove this reproach from</p>
<p>the Word of God, and second, to justify in a Christian way the
dis-</p>
<p>obedience, nay the rebellion, of the peasants.</p>
<p>First, It is our humble petition and request, as also the will
and</p>
<p>intention of all of us, that in the future we should have authority
and power so that a whole community should choose and appoint a pastor,
and also have the right to depose him. . . .</p>
<p>Second, Since the tithe is appointed in the Old Testament and
ful-</p>
<p>filled in the New, we will . . . pay the just tithe of grain, but in
a</p>
<p>proper way. … We will that for the future this be gathered and</p>
<p>received by our church provost, whom the community appoints; that out
of it there shall be given to the pastor … a modest, sufficient</p>
<p>maintenance for him and his . . . that the remainder shall be
distributed to the poor and needy who are in the same village. . . . The
small</p>
<p>tithe we will not give at all, for God created cattle for the free
use</p>
<p>of men. . . .</p>
<p>Third, It has been the custom hitherto for men to hold us as
their</p>
<p>own property, and this is pitiable, seeing that Christ has
redeemed</p>
<p>and bought us all with the precious shedding of His blood, the lowly
as well as the great. . . . Therefore it agrees with Scripture that we
be free, and will be so. . . . To our chosen and appointed rulers
(ap-</p>
<p>pointed for us by God) we are willingly obedient in all proper a
d</p>
<p>Christian matters, and have no doubt that, as true and real
Christians, they will gladly release us from serfdom, or show us in the
Gospel</p>
<p>that we are serfs. . . .</p>
<p>Sixth, We have a heavy grievance because of the services which</p>
<p>are increased from day to day</p>
<p>Eighth, We are greatly aggrieved, as many of us have holdings th
t</p>
<p>will not support the rents we pay, and the peasants suffer loss
and</p>
<p>ruin. Let the lords have honorable men inspect said holdings, and fix
fair rent . . . for every laborer is worthy of his hire. . . .</p>
<p>Tenth, We are aggrieved because some have appropriated to them-
selves meadows out of the common fields, which once belonged to</p>
<p>the community. . . .</p>
<p>Eleventh, We would have the death dues entirely abolished. We</p>
<p>will not suffer it, nor allow widows and orphans to be so shamefully
robbed. . . .</p>
<p>Twelfth, If one or more of the articles here set forth . . . can
be</p>
<p>shown to us by the Word of God to be improper, we will recede</p>
<p>from it if this is explained to us with arguments from Scripture .
18</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>38 6</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>The peasant leaders, encouraged by Luther’s semi -revolutionary pro-
nouncements, sent him a copy of the Articles, and asked for his support.
He replied with a pamphlet printed in April 1525: Ermahung mm Frieden (
Admonition to Peace). He applauded the peasants’ offer to submit to cor
- rection by Scripture. He noted the charges, now rising, that his
speeches and writings had stirred revolt; he denied his responsibility,
and referred to his inculcation of civil obedience. But he did not
withdraw his criticism of the master class:</p>
<p>We have no one on earth to thank for this mischievous rebellion</p>
<p>except you, princes and lords, and especially you blind bishops
and</p>
<p>mad priests and monks, whose hearts are hardened against the Holy
Gospel, though you know that it is true and that you cannot refute</p>
<p>it. Besides, in your temporal government, you do nothing but flay</p>
<p>and rob your subjects, in order that you may lead a life of
splendor</p>
<p>and pride, until the poor common people can bear it no longer. . .
.</p>
<p>Well, then, since you are the cause of this wrath of God, it will</p>
<p>undoubtedly come upon you, if you do not mend your ways in time.</p>
<p>. . . The peasants are mustering, and this must result in the
ruin,</p>
<p>destruction, and desolation of Germany by cruel murder and blood-
shed, unless God shall be moved by our repentance to prevent it . 19</p>
<p>He counseled the princes and lords to recognize the justice of many
of the Articles, and urged a policy of kindly consideration. To the
peasants he ad- dressed a frank admission of their wrongs, but pleaded
with them to refrain from violence and revenge; a resort to violence, he
predicted, would leave the peasants worse off than before. He foresaw
that a violent revolt would bring discredit upon the movement for
religious reform, and that he would be blamed for everything. He
objected to the appropriation of tithes by each congregation. The
authorities should be obeyed, and had a right to tax the people to pay
the expenses of government. The “freedom of the Chris - tian man” was to
be understood as a spiritual liberty, consistent with serf - dom, even
with slavery.</p>
<p>Did not Abraham and other patriarchs and prophets use slaves?</p>
<p>Read what St. Paul teaches about servants, who at that time were all
slaves. Therefore your third article is dead against the Gospel. . .
.</p>
<p>This article would make all men equal . . . and that is impossible.
For a worldly kingdom cannot stand unless there is in it an inequality
of persons, so that some are free, some imprisoned, some lords, some
subjects . 20</p>
<p>His final advice, had it been followed, would have spared Germany
much bloodshed and devastation:</p>
<p>THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>Choose among the nobles certain counts and lords, and from the</p>
<p>cities certain councilmen, and have these matters dealt with and</p>
<p>settled in a friendly way. You lords, let down your stubbornness</p>
<p>. . . and give up a little of your tyranny and oppression, so that
poor</p>
<p>people get air and room to live. The peasants for their part
should</p>
<p>let themselves be instructed, and give over and let go some of
the</p>
<p>Articles that grasp too far and too high. 21</p>
<p>The peasant leaders, however, felt that it was now too late to
retrace their steps; in any conciliation they would sooner or later be
punished. They mourned Luther as a traitor, and went on with the revolt.
Some of them took quite literally the dream of equality: the nobles were
to dismantle their castles, and live like peasants and burghers; they
were no longer to ride on horseback, for that raised them above their
fellow men. Pastors were to be informed that they were henceforth
servants, not masters, of their congre- gations, and would be expelled
if they did not adhere strictly and only to the Scriptures. 22
Corresponding demands came from the workmen of the towns. They denounced
the monopoly of city offices by the rich, the em- bezzlement of public
funds by corrupt officials, the perpetually rising prices while wages
stood almost still. “It would be better for the salvation of the soul,”
said one radical, “if the lord prelates were not so rich and luxurious,
and if their possessions were divided among the poor.” 23 Wendel Hipler
and Friedrich Weigant proposed that all Church property should be con-
fiscated to secular needs; that all transport tolls and tariff duties
should be removed; that there should be throughout the Empire one
coinage and one system of weights and measures. 24</p>
<p>The movement had a colorful assortment of leaders: the innkeepers
George Metzler and Metern Feuerbacher, the jolly roisterer Jacklein
Rohr- bach, some ex- soldiers and priests, and two knights from
Sickingen’s de - feated band — Florian Geyer and Gotz von Berlichingen
“of the Iron Hand”; Hauptmann and Goethe would later choose these two as
heroes for vivid plays. Each leader was sovereign over his own group,
and rarely concerted his action with the others. Nevertheless, in the
spring of 1525, the revolt flared up in a dozen scattered localities
about the same time. At Heilbronn, Rothenburg, and Wurzburg a commune of
labor representatives captured the municipal administration. At
Frankfurt-am-Main the victorious com- mune announced that it would
thereafter be council, burgomaster, pope, and emperor all in one. At
Rothenburg the priests were driven from the cathedral, religious images
were demolished, a chapel was smashed to the ground (March 27, 1525),
and clerical wine cellars were emptied with triumphant gaiety. 25 Towns
subject to feudal lords renounced their fealty; episcopal towns called
for an end to clerical privileges, and agitated for the secularization
of ecclesiastical property. Nearlv the whole duchy of Fran-</p>

<p>388</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>coma joined the revolt. Many lords and bishops, unprepared to resist,
swore to accept the reforms demanded of them; so the bishops of Speyer
and Bam- berg, and the abbots of Kempten and Herzfeld. Count William of
Henne- berg freed his serfs. Counts George and Albrecht of Hohenlohe
were summoned before peasant leaders and were initiated into the new
order: “Brother George and brother Albrecht, come hither and swear to
the peas - ants to be as brothers to them, for you are now no longer
lords but peas- ants.” 26 Most of the towns received the rural rebels
with a hearty welcome.</p>
<p>The first serious encounter took place at Leipheim on the Danube near
Ulm (April 4, 1525). Under an energetic priest, Jakob Wehe, 3,000 peas-
ants captured the town, drank all discoverable wine, pillaged the
church, smashed the organ, made themselves leggings from sacerdotal
vestments, and paid mock homage to one of their number seated on the
altar and robed as a priest. 27 An army of mercenaries hired by the
Swabian League and led by an able general, Georg von Truchsess, laid
siege to Leipheim, and frightened the undisciplined peasants into
surrender. Wehe and four other leaders were beheaded, the rest were
spared, but the League’s troops burned many peas - ant cottages.</p>
<p>On Good Friday, April 15, 1525, three rebel contingents under
Metzler, Geyer, and Rohrbach laid siege to the town of Weinsberg (near
Heilbronn), whose ruling Count Ludwig von Helfenstein was especially
hated for his severities. A delegation of peasants approached the walls
and asked for a parley; the Count and his knights made a sudden sortie
and massacred the delegation. On Easter Sunday the attackers, helped by
some citizens of the town, broke through the walls, and cut down the
forty men-at-arms who cared to resist. The Count, his wife (a daughter
of the late Emperor Maxi- milian) , and sixteen knights were taken
prisoner. Rohrbach, without consult- ing Metzler or Geyer, ordered the
seventeen men to run the gantlet between rows of peasants armed with
pikes. The Count offered all his fortune in ransom; it was refused as a
temporizing expedient. The Countess, prostrate and delirious, begged for
her husband’s life; Rohrbach bade t wo men hold her up so that she could
witness the orgy of revenge. As the Count walked to his death amid a
volley of daggers and pikes, the peasants recalled to him his own
brutalities. “You thrust my brother into a dungeon,” one cried, “because
he did not bare his head as you passed by.” “You harnessed us like oxen
to the yoke,” shouted others; “you caused the hands of my father to be
cut off because he killed a hare on his own field. . . . Your horses,
dogs, and huntsmen have trodden down my crops. . . . You have wrung the
last penny out of us.” During the next half -hour the sixteen knights
were similarly laid to rest. The Countess was allowed to retire to a
convent. 28</p>
<p>In nearly every section of Germany peasant bands were running
riot.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION 389</p>
<p>Monasteries were sacked, or were compelled to pay high ransoms. “No -
where,” says a letter of April 7, 1525, “do the insurgents make a secret
of , . . their intention to kill all clerics who will not break with the
Church, to destroy all cloisters and episcopal palaces, and to root the
Catholic religion utterly out of the land.” 29 This is probably an
exaggeration, but we may note that in Bavaria, Austria, and Tirol, where
Protestantism had apparently been suppressed, the rebels captured many
towns, and compelled Archduke Ferdinand to agree that all preaching
should henceforth be according to Scripture — a characteristic
Protestant demand. At Mainz Archbishop Al- brecht fled before the storm,
but his deputy saved the see by signing the Twelve Articles and paying a
ransom of 15,000 guilders. On April 11 the townsfolk of Bamberg
renounced the bishop’s feudal sovereignty, pillaged and burned his
castle, and plundered the houses of the orthodox. In Alsace the revolt
spread so rapidly that by April’s end every Catholic or rich land - lord
in the province was in terror of his life. On April 28 an army of 20,000
peasants attacked Zabern, seat of the bishop of Strasbourg, and
despoiled his monastery; on May 1 3 they took the town, forced every
fourth man to join them, renounced all payment of tithes, and demanded
that thereafter all officials except the emperor should be elected by
popular suffrage, and be subject to recall. 30 At Brixen in Tirol a
former episcopal secretary, Michael Gasmaier, organized a revolt that
attacked all orthodox clergymen, sacked the local monastery (May 12),
and remained rampant and unsubdued for a year. In all the valleys of the
Inn and Etsch rivers, says an unsympathetic chronicler of the time,
“there was such a concourse, cry, and tumult that hardly might a good
man walk in the streets. Robbing and plundering . . . be- came so common
that even pious men were tempted thereto.” 81 At Freiburg - im-Breisgau
the peasants looted castles and monasteries, and forced the city to join
the “Evangelical Brotherhood” (May 24) . In that same month a peas - ant
band drove the bishop of Wurzburg out of his palace, and feasted on his
stores. In June the powerful and warlike Archbishop Matthias Lang was
chased from his palace in Salzburg into his castle fortress overlooking
the city. In Neustadt in the Palatinate Elector Ludwig, surrounded by
8,000 armed peasants, invited their leaders to dinner, and cheerfully
complied with their demands. “There,” said a contemporary, “one saw
villeins and their lord sit together, eat and drink together. He had, as
it seemed, one heart to them, and they to him.” 32</p>
<p>Amid this torrent of events Luther issued from the press of
Wittenberg, toward the middle of May 1525, a pamphlet “Against the
Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants.” Its vehemence startled prince
and peasant, prelate and humanist, alike. Shocked by the excesses of the
infuriated rebels, dreading a possible overturn of all law and
government in Germany, and</p>
<p>390 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>stung by charges that his own teachings had loosed the flood, he now
ranged himself unreservedly on the side of the imperiled lords.</p>
<p>In the former book I did not venture to judge the peasants, since</p>
<p>they had offered to be set right and be instructed. . . . But before

<p>Any man against whom sedition can be proved is outside the law</p>

<p>He rejected the supposed Scriptural warrant for communism:</p>
<p>The Gospel does not make goods common, except in the case of</p>
<p>those who do of their own free will what the Apostles and
disciples</p>
<p>did in Acts iv. They did not demand, as do our insane peasants in
their raging, that the goods of others — of a Pilate or a Herod — should
be common, but only their own goods. Our peasants, however, would</p>
<p>hav e other men’s goods common, and keep their own goods for them -
selves. Fine Christians these! I think there is not a devil left in
hell;</p>
<p>they have all gone into the peasants.</p>
<p>To Catholic rulers he offered his forgiveness if they smote the
rebels with- out trial. To Protestant rulers he recommended prayer,
contrition, and negotiation; but if the peasants remain obdurate,</p>
<p>then swiftly grasp the sword. For a prince or lord must remember</p>
<p>in this case that he is God’s minister and the servant of His wra
th</p>
<p>(Romans, xiii), to whom the sword is committed for use upon such</p>
<p>fellows. … If he can punish and does not — even though the punish-
ment consist in the taking of life and the shedding of blood — then</p>
<p>he is guilty of all the murder and all the evil which these
fellows</p>
<p>commit. . . . The rulers, then, should go on unconcerned, and with a
good conscience lay about them as long as their hearts still beat. . .

<p>THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>39i</p>
<p>It was Luther’s misfortune that this outburst reached its readers
just about the time that the forces of the propertied classes were
beginning to subdue the revolt; and the Reformer received undue credit
for the terrorism of the suppression. It is unlikely that the endangered
masters were influenced by the pamphlet; it was in their temper to
handle the insurgents with a severity that would serve as a deterrent in
unforgettable memory. For a time they had bemused the simple peasants
with parleys and promises, and had thereby persuaded many of the bands
to disperse; meanwhile the masters organized and armed their levies.</p>
<p>At the height of the turmoil Elector Frederick died (May 5, 1525),
him- self calm and at peace, admitting that he and other princes had
wronged the peasant, refusing to join in extreme measures of
retaliation, and leaving to his successor, Duke John, urgent counsels of
moderation. But the new Elec- tor felt that his brother’s policy had
been unwisely lenient. He joined his forces with those of Duke Henry of
Brunswick and Philip Landgrave of Hesse, and together they moved against
Miinzer’s encampment outside Miihlhausen. The opposed armies were
matched only in number — each some 8,000 strong; but the ducal troops
were mostly trained soldiers, while the peasants, despite Miinzer’s home
-made artillery, were indifferently armed, poorly disciplined, and
disordered with natural fright. Miinzer relied on his eloquence to
restore morale, and led the peasants in prayer and hymns. The first
barrage of the princely cannon slaughtered hundreds, and the terrified
rebels fled into the town of Frankenhausen (May 15, 1525). The victors
followed, and massacred 5,000. Three hundred prisoners were condemned to
death; their women pleaded mercy for them; it was granted, on condition
that the women should beat out the brains of two priests who had encour-
aged the revolt; it was so done, while the triumphant dukes looked on.
84 Miinzer hid, was captured, was tortured into confessing the error of
his ways, and was beheaded before the headquarters of the princes.
Pfeiffer and his 1,200 soldiers defended Miihlhausen; they were
overcome; Pfeiffer and other leaders were put to death, but the citizens
were spared on paying a total ransom of 40,000 guilders (,000,000?).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Truchsess took the town of Boblingen by negotiation, and
from within its walls turned his guns upon a rebel camp outside (May
12). Those of the peasants who survived this cannonade were cut down by
his cavalry; this ended the revolt in Wiirttemberg. Turning next to
Weinsberg, Truchsess burned it to the ground, and slowly roasted
Jacklein Rohrbach, who had directed the “Massacre of Weinsberg.”
Truchsess marched on to rout peasant forces at Konigshofen and
Ingolstadt, recaptured Wurzburg, and beheaded eighty-one chosen rebels
as a memento for the rest (June 5). Florian Geyer escaped from Wurzburg
into obscurity, and remained a cher- ished legend. Gotz von Berlichingen
surrendered in apt time, lived to fight</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>392</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>for Charles V against the Turks, and died in his own bed and castle
at eighty- two (1562). Rothenberg was taken on June 20, Memmingen soon
after- ward. The revolt in Alsace was crushed by the slaughter of from
2,000 to 6,000 men at Lipstein and Zabern (May 17-18). By May 27 some
20,000 peasants had been killed in Alsace alone, in many cases after
surrender; the air of the towns was fetid with the stench of the dead.
85 Markgraf Casimir had some of his surrendering peasants beheaded, some
hanged; in milder cases he chopped off hands or gouged out eyes. 86
Saner princes finally inter- vened to reduce the barbarism of the
retaliation, and at the end of August the Diet of Augsburg issued a
rescript urging moderation in punishments and fines. “If all the rebels
are killed,” one philosophic noble asked, “where</p>
<p>In Austria the revolt continued for a year. In January 1526,
Michael</p>
<p>Gasmaier proclaimed throughout Tirol the most radical of the
revolutionary programs. All “godless” (i.e., non -Protestants) who
persecuted the true Word of God, or who oppressed the common man, were
to be put to death. All pictures and shrines were to be removed from the
churches, and no Masses were to be said. Town walls, towers, and
fortresses were to be de- molished; there should now be only villages,
and all men were to be equal. Officials and judges were to be chosen by
universal adult male suffrage. Feudal rents and dues were to end at
once; tithes were to be collected, but were to be given to the Reformed
Church and the poor. Monasteries were to be converted into hospitals or
schools. Mines were to be nationalized. Prices were to be fixed by the
government. 88 For a time Gasmaier, with clever strategy, defeated the
troops sent against him, but he was finally out- witted, and fled to
Italy. The Archduke Ferdinand set a price on his head, and two Spanish
cutthroats earned the sum by assassinating him in his room in Padua
(1528).</p>
<p>The losses of German life and property in the Peasants’ Revolt were
to be exceeded only in the Thirty Years’ War. Of peasants alone some 1
30,000 died in battle or in expiation. There were 10,000 executions
under the juris- diction of the Swabian League; Truchsess’ executioner
boasted that he had killed 1,200 condemned men with his own practiced
hand. The peasants themselves had destroyed hundreds of castles and
monasteries. Hundreds of villages and towns had been depopulated or
ruined, or impoverished by huge indemnities. Over 50,000 homeless
peasants roamed the highways or hid in the woods. Widows and orphans
were legion, but charity was heartless or penniless. The rebels had in
many instances burned the charters that re- corded their feudal dues;
new charters were now drawn up, renewing the obligations, sometimes more
leniently, sometimes more rigorously, than before. Concessions were made
to the peasants in Austria, Baden, and Hesse; elsewhere serfdom was
strengthened, and would continue, east of the Elbe,</p>
<p>THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>393</p>
<p>till the nineteenth century. Democratic beginnings were aborted.
Intellec- tual developments were stunted; censorship of publications
increased, under Catholic and Protestant authorities alike. Humanism
wilted in the fire; the Renaissance joy in life and literature and love
gave way to theology, pietism, and meditations on death.</p>
<p>The Reformation itself almost perished in the Peasants’ War. Despite
Luther’s disclaimers and denunciations, the rebellion had flaunted
Protes - tant colors and ideas: economic aspirations were dressed in
phrases that Luther had sanctified; communism was to be merely a return
to the Gospel. Charles V interpreted the uprising as “a Lutheran
movement.” 39 Conserv - atives classed the expropriation of
ecclesiastical property by Protestants as revolutionary actions on a par
with the sacking of monasteries by peasants. In the south the frightened
princes and lords renewed their fealty to the Roman Church. In several
places, as at Bamberg and Wurzburg, men even of the propertied class
were executed for having accepted Lutheranism. 40 The peasants
themselves turned against the Reformation as a lure and a betrayal; some
called Luther Dr. Liigner — “Dr. Liar”— and “toady of the princes.” 41
For years after the revolt he was so unpopular that he seldom dared
leave Wittenberg, even to attend his father’s deathbed (1530). “All is
forgotten that God has done for the world through me,” he wrote (June
15, 1525); “now lords, priests, and peasants are all against me, and
threaten my death.” 42</p>
<p>It was not in his character to yield ground or apologize. On May 30,
1525, he wrote to Nicholas Amsdorf: “My opinion is that it is better
that all peasants be killed than that the princes and magistrates
perish, because the rustics took the sword without divine authority.” 43
In July 1525, he pub - lished An Open Letter Concerning the Hard Book
against the Peasants. His critics, he said, deserved no answer; their
criticisms showed them to be rebels at heart, like the peasants, and no
more deserving of mercy; “the rulers ought to seize these people by the
cap and make them hold their tongues.” 44</p>
<p>If they think this answer is too hard, and that this is talking
violence</p>
<p>and only shutting men’s mouths, I reply that this is right. A rebel
is</p>
<p>not worth answering with arguments, for he does not accept them.</p>
<p>The answer for such mouth is a fist that brings blood from the nose.
The peasants would not listen . . . their ears must be unbuttoned with
bullets, till their heads jump off their shoulders. Such pupils need
such a rod. He who will not hear God’s Word when it is spoken with</p>
<p>kindness must listen to the headsman when he comes with his axe.</p>
<p>… Of mercy I will neither hear nor know anything, but give heed</p>
<p>to God’s will in His Word. … If He will have wrath and not mercy,</p>
<p>what have you to do with mercy? Did not Saul sin by showing mercy
upon Amalek when he failed to execute God’s wrath as he had been
commanded? … You who are praising mercy so highly because the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>peasants are beaten, why did you not praise it when the peasants were
raging, smiting, robbing, burning, and plundering, until they were</p>
<p>terrible to men’s eyes and ears? Why were they not merciful to
the</p>
<p>princes and lords, whom they wanted to wipe out entirely?</p>
<p>Mercy, Luther argued, is the duty of Christians in their private
capacity; as officers of the state, however, they must normally follow
justice rather than mercy, for since Adam and Eve’s sin man has been so
wicked that</p>
<p>If the intentions of the peasants had been carried out, no honest man
would have been safe from them, but whoever had a pfennig more</p>
<p>than another would have had to suffer for it. They had already begun
that, and they would not have stopped there; women and children</p>
<p>would have been put to shame; they would have taken to killing one
another too, and there would have been no peace or safety anywhere.</p>
<p>Has anything been heard of more unrestrained than a mob of</p>
<p>peasants when they are fed full and have gotten power? . . . The</p>
<p>ass will have blows, and the people will be ruled by force . 45</p>
<p>Luther’s extreme statements about the Peasants’ War shock us today be
- cause social order has been so well established that we presume on its
con- tinuance, and can treat with lenience those few who would violently
disturb it. But Luther faced the harsh reality of peasant bands
transforming their just grievances into indiscriminate pillage, and
threatening the complete overturn of law, government, production, and
distribution in Germany. Events justified his premonition that the
religious revolution for which he had risked his life would be gravely
imperiled by the conservative reaction that was bound to follow an
unsuccessful revolt. He may have felt some personal debt to the princes
and nobles who had protected him in Witten- berg and Worms and the
Wartburg, and he might well wonder who would save him against Charles V
and Clement VII if princely power ceased to shield the Reformation. The
one freedom that seemed to him worth fighting for was the freedom to
worship God, to seek salvation according to one’s conscience. What
difference did it make whether, in this brief V orspiel to eternal life,
one was a prince or a slave? We should accept our state here without
complaint, bound in body and duty, but free in soul and the grace of
God.</p>
<p>And yet the peasants had a case against him. He had not only
predicted social revolution, he had said he would not be displeased by
it, he would greet it with a smile, even if men washed their hands in
episcopal blood. He too had made a revolution, had endangered social
order, had flouted au-</p>
<p>THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>thority not less divine than the state’s. He had made no protest
against the secular appropriation of ecclesiastical property. How
otherwise than by force could peasants better their lot when ballots
were forbidden them, and their oppressors daily wielded force? The
peasants felt that the new religion had sanctified their cause, had
aroused them to hope and action, and had deserted them in the hour of
decision. Some of them, in angry despair, be- came cynical atheists. 46
Many of them, or their children, shepherded by Jesuits, returned to the
Catholic fold. Some of them followed the radicals whom Luther had
condemned, and heard in the New Testament a sum- mons to communism.</p>

<li>THE ANABAPTISTS TRY COMMUNISM: 1 534-36</li>
</ol>
<p>Only by observing with what devout enthusiasm some of our contempo-
raries adopt economic heresies can we understand the fervor with which
pious rebellious minorities followed, even to the stake, one or another
turn of the religious revolution in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The most radical of the new sects took the name of Anabaptists
(Wieder- taufer, Again- Baptizers) from its insistence that baptism, if
given in infancy, should be repeated in maturity, and that still better
it should be deferred, as by John the Baptist, till the mature recipient
could knowingly and volun- tarily make his profession of the Christian
faith. There were sects within this sect. Those who followed Hans Denck
and Ludwig Hatzer denied the divinity of Christ: He was only the most
godly of men, Who had redeemed us not by His agony on the cross but by
the example of His life. 47 Denck exalted the individual conscience
above the Church, the state, and the Bible itself. Most Anabaptists
adopted a Puritan severity of morals and simplicity of manners and
dress. Developing with rash logic Luther’s idea of Christian liberty,
they condemned all government by force, and all resistance to it by
force. They rejected military service on the ground that it is
invariably sinful to take human life. Like the early Christians, they
refused to swear oaths, not excepting oaths of allegiance to prince or
emperor. Their usual salutation was “The peace of the Lord be with you”—
an echo of the Jewish and Moslem greeting, and a forerunner of the
Quaker mode. While Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and Knox agreed with the
popes on the absurdity of reli- gious toleration, the Anabaptists
preached and practiced it; one of them, Balthasar Hiibmaier, wrote the
first clear defense of it (1524). 48 They shunned public office and all
resort to litigation. They were Tolstoyan an- archists three centuries
before Tolstoy, and a century after Peter Chelcicky, from whom they may
have derived their creed. Consciously or unwittingly inheriting the
doctrine of the Bohemian Taborites or the Moravian Brethren,</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>some Anabaptists proclaimed a community of goods; 49 a few, if we may
credit hostile chroniclers, proposed a community of wives. 80 In
general, how- ever, the sect rejected any compulsory sharing of goods,
advocated volun- tary mutual aid, and held that in the Kingdom of Heaven
communism would be automatic and universal. 81 All the Anabaptist groups
were inspired by the Apocalypse and the confident expectation of
Christ’s early return to the earth; many believers professed to know the
day and hour of His coming. Then all the ungodly — in this case all but
Anabaptists — would be swept away by the sword of the Lord, and the
elect would live in glory in a terrestrial paradise without laws or
marriage, and abounding in all good things. 82 So hopeful men steeled
themselves against toil and monogamy.</p>
<p>The Anabaptists appeared first in Switzerland. Perhaps a pacifistic
Chris- tianity had seeped in from the Waldenses of southern France and
the Beg- hards of the Netherlands. Here and there, as in Basel, a few
intellectuals sponsored the idea of a communistic society. Communistic
passages in More’s Utopia may have stirred the scholars who gathered
around Erasmus there. Three members of that circle became Anabaptist
leaders: Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz of Zurich, and Balthasar Hiibmaier
of Waldshut — just across the border in Austria. In 1524 Miinzer visited
Waldshut, Carlstadt came to Zurich, and an Anabaptist sect formed in
Zurich under the nam e of “Spirit - uals” or “Brethren.” It preached
adult baptism and the coming of Christ, re - jected Church and state,
and proposed an end to interest charges, taxes, military service,
tithes, and oaths.</p>
<p>At this time Ulrich Zwingli was winning the Great Council of Zurich
to his Protestant views, which included the control of religion by the
secular authorities. He pleaded with the “Brethren” to relax their
antipathy to the state, and to practice infant baptism; they refused.
The Council summoned them to a public disputation (January 17, 1525);
failing to convert them, it decreed that the parents of unbaptized
children must leave the town. The Anabaptists denounced the Council,
called Zwingli an old dragon, and paraded the streets crying, “Woe to
Zurich!” 58 Their leaders were arrested and banished, which enabled them
to spread their doctrines. Saint-Gall and Appenzell took up the
movement; Bern and Basel were stirred by it; Hiib- maier won nearly all
Waldshut to his views. In Appenzell 1,200 men and women, accepting
literally the words of Christ — “Take no thought what ye shall eat”— sat
down and waited for God to come and feed them. 84</p>
<p>The apparent success of the Peasants’ War in the spring of 1525
promoted these conversions, but its failure encouraged the propertied
classes in the Swiss cities to repressive measures. The Council of
Zurich arrested Manz (July), then Grebel, then Hiibmaier, and ordered
that all obstinate Ana- baptists “should be laid in the tower,” kept on
bread and water, and “left to die and rot.” 88 Grebel did; Manz was
drowned; Hiibmaier recanted, was</p>
<p>CHAP, xvn) THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION 397</p>
<p>freed, recanted his recantation, and undertook to convert Augsburg
and Moravia; Hatzer was beheaded at Constance for Anabaptism and
adultery. Protestant and Catholic cantons showed equal energy in
subduing the sect, and by 1530 nothing remained of it in Switzerland
except some secret and negligible bands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the movement had spread like a rumor through South Ger-
many. A zeal for evangelistic propaganda caught the converts, and turned
them into ardent missionaries for the new creed. In Augsburg Denck and
Hiibmaier made rapid headway among the textile workers and the lower
middle class. In Tirol many miners, contrasting their poverty with the
wealth of the Fuggers and Hochstetters who owned the mines, took up Ana-
baptism when the Peasants’ Revolt collapsed. In Strasbourg the struggle
be - tween Catholics and Protestants allowed the sect to multiply
unnoticed for a time. But a pamphlet of 1528 warned the authorities that
“he who teaches</p>
<p>Some were racked and drawn asunder; others were burnt to ashes</p>
<p>and dust; some were roasted on pillars or torn with red-hot
pincers.</p>
<p>. . . Others were hanged on trees, beheaded with the sword, or thrown
into the water. . . . Some starved or rotted in darksome prisons. . .
.</p>
<p>Some who were deemed too young for execution were whipped with rods,
and many lay for years in dungeons. . . . Numbers had holes</p>
<p>burnt into their cheeks. . . . The rest were hunted from one
country</p>
<p>and place to another. Like owls and ravens, which durst not fly
by</p>
<p>day, they were often compelled to hide and live in rocks and
clefts,</p>
<p>in wild forests, or in caves and pits. 67</p>
<p>By 1530, says the contemporary Sebastian Franck, 2,000 Anabaptists
had been put to death. In one Alsatian city, Ensisheim, 600 were
executed. In Salzburg those who recanted were allowed to have their
heads cut off before being placed upon the pyre; the unrepentant were
roasted to death over a slow fire (152 8). 68 Anabaptists composed
touching hymns to commemorate these martyrdoms; and most of the hymn
writers became martyrs in their turn.</p>
<p>Despite these killings the sect increased, and moved into northern
Ger- many. In Prussia and Wurttemberg some nobles welcomed the
Anabaptists as peaceful and industrious farmers. In Saxony, says an
early Lutheran his- torian, the valley of the Werra was filled with
them, and in Erfurt they</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>claimed to have sent forth 300 missionaries to convert the dying
world. In Liibeck, Jurgen Wullenwever, who was accused of Anabaptism,
briefly cap- tured control of the city (1533-34). 1 ° Moravia, Hiibmaier
made progress with his moderate doctrine, which explained communism not
as “common property,” but as holding that “one should feed the hungry,
give drink to the thirsty, and clothe the naked, for in truth we are not
masters of our possessions, but stewards or dispensers only.” 59 Hans
Hut, fired by the teach - ings of Miinzer, won the Anabaptists of
Moravia away from Hiibmaier by preaching a full community of goods.
Hiibmaier retired to Vienna, where he was burned at the stake, and Ids
wife was thrown bound into the Danube (1528).</p>
<p>Hut and his followers established a communist center at Austerlitz,
where, as if foreseeing Napoleon, they renounced all military service,
and de- nounced every kind of war. Confining themselves to tillage and
petty in- dustry, these Anabaptists maintained their communism for
almost a century. The nobles who owned the land protected them as
enriching the estates by their conscientious toil. Farming was communal
among them; materials for agriculture and handicraft were bought and
allotted by communal officers; part of the proceeds was paid to the
landlord as rent, the rest was distributed according to need. The social
unit was not the family but the Haushabe, or household, containing some
400 to 2,000 persons, with a common kitchen, a common laundry, a school,
a hospital, and a brewery. Children, after weaning, were brought up in
common, but monogamy remained. In the Thirty Years’ War, by an Imperial
edict of 1622, this communistic society was suppressed; its members
accepted Catholicism or were banished. Some of the exiles went to
Russia, some to Hungary. We shall hear of them again.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands Melchior Hofmann, a Swabian tanner, preached the
Anabaptist gospel with exciting success. At Leyden his pupil Jan Matthys
rose to the conclusion that the advent of the New Jerusalem could no
longer be patiently awaited, but must be achieved at once, and, if
necessary, by force. He sent out through Holland twelve apostles to
announce the glad tidings. The ablest of them was a young tailor, Jan
Beuckelszoon, known to history as John of Leyden, and to Meyerbeer’s
opera as Le Prophete.</p>
<p>Named from the monastery around which it had grown, Munster was</p>

<p>399</p>
<p>feudally subject to its bishop and cathedral chapter. Nevertheless
the growth of industry and commerce had generated a degree of democracy.
The as- sembled citizens, representing seventeen guilds, annually chose
ten electors, who chose the city council. But the well-to-do minority
provided most of the political ability, and naturally dominated the
council. In 1525, enthusi- astic over the peasants’ uprisings, the lower
classes p resented thirty- six “de - mands” to the council. A few of
these were granted, the rest were humored with procrastination. A
Lutheran preacher, Bernard Rottman, made him- self the mouthpiece of
discontent, and asked Jan Matthys to send some Dutch Anabaptists to his
aid. John of Leyden came (January 13, 1534), and soon Jan Matthys
himself. Fearing insurrection, the “party of order” arranged to have
Bishop Franz von Waldeck enter the town with his 2,000 troops. The
populace, led by Matthys, Rottman, and John of Leyden, fought them in
the streets, drove them out, and took martial control of Munster
(February 10, 1534). New elections were held; the Anabaptists won the
council; two of their number, Knipperdollingk and Kippenbroick, were
chosen burgomasters; the exciting experiment began.</p>
<p>Munster found itself at once in a state of war, besieged by the
Bishop and his reinforced army, and fearful that soon all the powers of
order and custom in Germany would unite against it. To protect itself
against internal op- position, the new council decreed that all
non-Anabaptists must accept re- baptism or leave the city. It was a
cruel measure, for it meant that old men, women carrying infants, and
barefoot children had to ride or trudge from the town at the height of a
German winter. During the siege both sides executed without mercy any
persons found working for the enemy. Under the stress of war the council
was superseded by a popular assembly and an executive Committee of
Public Safety, in both of which the religious leaders were supreme.
Matthys died fighting in an abortive sortie (April 5, 1534), and
thereafter John of Leyden ruled the city as its king.</p>
<p>The “communism” that was now set up was a war economy, as perhaps all
strict communism must be; for men are by nature unequal, and can be
induced to share their goods and fortunes only by a vital and common
dan- ger; internal liberty varies with external security, and communism
breaks under the tensions of peace. In peril of their lives if they fell
short of unity, inspired by religious faith and inescapable eloquence,
the besieged accepted a “socialist theocracy” 60 in the desperate hope
that they were realizing the New Jerusalem visioned in the Apocalypse.
The members of the Committee of Public Safety were called “the elders of
the twelve tribes of Israel,” and</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>the besieged population neared starvation; the evidence is
inconclusive, and leaders always feel an urgent obligation to keep well.
Most of the confiscated luxuries were distributed among the people; “the
poorest among us,” wrote one of them, “now go about sumptuously
attired”; 6 1 they hungered in magnificence.</p>
<p>Otherwise the communism of Munster was limited and tentative. The
rulers, according to a hostile witness, decreed that “all possessions
should be in common,” 62 but in truth private property continued in
practically every - thing except jewels, precious metals, and the booty
of war. Meals were taken in common, but only by those engaged in defense
of the town. At these meals a chapter was read from the Bible, and
sacred songs were sung. Three “deacons” were appointed to supply the
necessities of the poor; and to secure materials for these charities the
remaining well-to-do were persuaded or compelled to yield up their
superfluity. Land available for cultivation within the city was assigned
to each household according to its size. One edict con- firmed the
traditional dominion of the husband over the wife. 63</p>
<p>Public morals were regulated by strict laws. Dances, games, and
religious plays were encouraged, under supervision, but drunkenness and
gambling were severely punished, prostitution was banned, fornication
and adultery were made capital crimes. An excess of women, caused by the
flight of many men, moved the leaders to decree, on the basis of
Biblical precedents, that unattached women should become “companions of
wives”— in effect, con- cubines. 64 The newly attached women seem to
have accepted the situation as preferable to solitary barrenness. Some
conservatives in the city protested, organized a revolt, and imprisoned
the King; but their soldiers, soon besotted with wine, were slaughtered
by the resurgent Anabaptist soldiery; and in this victory of the New
Jerusalem the women played a virile role. John, re- leased and
re-enthroned, took several wives and (say the hostile chroniclers)
governed with violence and tyranny. 65 He must have had some genial
quali- ties, for thousands gladly bore his rule, and offered their lives
in his service. When he called for volunteers to follow him in a sortie
against the Bishop’s camp, more women enlisted than he thought it wise
to use. When he asked for “apostles” to venture forth and seek aid from
other Anabaptist groups, twelve men tried to get through the enemy’s
lines, were all caught, and all killed. One fervent woman, inspired by
the story of Judith, sallied out to assassinate the Bishop; she was
intercepted and put to death.</p>
<p>Though many Anabaptists in Germany and Holland repudiated the resort
of their Munster brethren to force, many more applauded the revolution.
Cologne, Trier, Amsterdam, and Leyden murmured with Anabaptist prayers
for its success. From Amsterdam fifty vessels sailed (March 2 2 and
25,1535) to carry reinforcements to the beleaguered city, but all were
dispersed by the Dutch authorities. On March 28, echoing the Munster
uprising, an Ana-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION 401</p>
<p>baptist band captured and fortified a monastery in West Friesland; it
was overcome with a loss of 800 lives.</p>
<p>Confronted with this spreading revolt, the conservative forces of the
Empire, Protestant as well as Catholic, mobilized to suppress Anabaptism
everywhere. Luther, who in 1528 had counseled lenience with the new
here- tics, advised in 1530 “the use of the sword” against them as “not
only blas - phemous but highly seditious”; 66 and Melanchthon concurred.
City after city sent money or men to the Bishop; a diet at Worms (April
4, 1535) ordered a tax on all Germany to finance the siege. The Bishop
was now able to surround the town and effectively shut off all its
supplies.</p>
<p>Facing famine and deteriorating morale. King John announced that all
wno wished might leave the city. Many women and children, and some men,
seized the opportunity. The men were imprisoned or killed by the
Bishop’s soldiers, who spared the women for divers services. One of the
emigres saved his life by offering to show the besiegers an undefended
part of the walls. Under his guidance a force of Landsknechts scaled
them and opened a gate (June 24); soon several thousand troops poured
into the town. Starvation had so far done its work that only 800 of the
besieged could still bear arms. They barricaded themselves in the market
place; then they surrendered on a promise of a safe-conduct to leave
Munster; when they had yielded up their arms they were massacred en
masse. Houses were searched, and 400 hidden survivors were slain. John
of Leyden and two of his aides were bound to stakes; every part of their
bodies was clawed with red-hot pincers, until “nearly all who were
standing in the market place were sickened by the stench”; their tongues
were pulled from their mou ths; at last daggers were driven into their
hearts. 67</p>
<p>The Bishop regained his city and augmented his former power;
henceforth all actions of the civil authorities were to be subject to
episcopal veto. Ca- tholicism was triumphantly restored. Throughout the
Empire the Anabap- tists, fearing for their lives, repudiated every
member guilty of using force.</p>
<p>Nevertheless many of these pacifist heretics were executed.
Melanchthon and Luther advised Philip of Hesse to put to death all
adherents of the sect. 68 The conservative leaders felt that so serious
a threat to the established eco- nomic and political order should be
punished with an unforgettable severity.</p>
<p>The Anabaptists accepted the lesson, postponed communism to the
millen- nium, and resigned themselves to the practice of such of their
principles — of sober, simple, pious, peaceful living — as did not
offend the state. Menno Simons, a Catholic priest converted to
Anabaptism (1531), gave to his Dutch and German followers such skillful
guidance that the “Mennonites” survived ail tribulations, and formed
successful agricultural communities in Holland, Russia, and America.
There is no clear filiation between the Continental Anabaptists and the
English Quakers and the American Baptists; but the</p>
<p>402 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Quaker rejection of war and oaths, and the Baptist insistence on
adult bap- tism probably stem from the same traditions of creed and
conduct that in Switzerland, Germany, and Holland took Anabaptist forms
. 69 One quality nearly all these groups had in common — their
willingness to bear peaceably with faiths other than their own. The
theology that supported them through hardship, poverty, and martyrdom
hardly accords with our transient phi- losophy; but they, too, in their
sincerity, devotion, and friendliness, en- riched our heritage, and
redeemed our tarnished humanity.*</p>
