<h4 id="chapter-xvii">CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<p>The Revolt of the Netherlands</p>
<p>1555-1648</p>
<p>/. MISE-ENSC&amp;NE</p>
<p>O N October 25, 1555, the Emperor Charles V transferred the sov-</p>
<p>ereignty of the Netherlands to his son Philip. On the
twenty-sixth,</p>
<p>before the States-General at Brussels, Philip received oaths of
allegiance, and swore to maintain the rights and privileges of the
seventeen provinces according to tradition, treaty, and law. Those
mutual pledges set the stage for one of the great dramas in the history
of freedom.</p>
<p>The scene was complex. The Netherlands — i.e., the lowlands — then
comprised the present Belgium as well as the existing Kingdom of the
Netherlands. Dutch — Low German — was the language not only of the seven
northern provinces (Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Friesland, Gronin- gen,
Overijssel, and Gelderland) but also of four provinces (Flanders,
Brabant, Mechlin, and Limburg) in northern “Belgium”; while Walloon, a
dialect of French, was spoken in six southern provinces (Artoi.s,
Walloon Flanders, Cambrai, Tournai, Hainaut, and Namur). All these, and
the neighboring duchy of Luxembourg, were under Hapsburg rule.</p>
<p>The people, in 1555, were overwhelmingly Catholic,^ but their
Catholi- cism was of the humane humanist kind preached by Erasmus a
half-century back and generally practiced in Renaissance Rome — not the
somber, un- compromising type developed in Spain by centuries of war
against Moslem “infidels.” After 1520 Lutheranism and Anabaptism seeped
in from Ger - many, and then, more numerously, Calvinism from Germany,
Switzerland, and France. Charles V tried to stem these inroads by
importing the papal or episcopal form of the Inquisition and by
proclaiming, through “plac - ards,” the most terrible penalties for any
serious deviation from Catholic orthodoxy; but after the weakening of
his power by the Peace of Passau (1552) these penalties were rarely
enforced. In 1558 a Rotterdam crowd forcibly rescued several Anabaptists
from the stake. Alarmed by the growth of heresy, Philip renewed the
placards and their penalties. Fear spread that he intended to introduce
the Spanish form of the Inquisition in all its severity.</p>
<p>Calvinism was congenial to the mercantile element in the economy. The
ports of Antwerp and Amsterdam were the central ganglia of north-Eu-</p>
<p>436</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>ropean commerce, alive with importation, exportation, speculation,
and every form of finance; insurance alone kept six hundred agents in
affluence.^ The rivers Rhine, Maas, Ijssel, Waal, Scheldt, and Lys and a
hundred canals bore in silence a dozen varieties of transport. The winds
of trade fed the fires of craft and factory industry in Brussels, Ghent,
Ypres, Tour- nai, Valenciennes, Namur, Mechlin, Leiden, Utrecht,
Haarlem. The busi- nessmen who controlled these towns respected
Catholicism as a tradition- rooted pillar of political, social, and
moral stability; but they had no relish for its pompous heirarchy, and
they liked the role given to the educated laity in the management of
Calvinist congregations and policy. More immediately they resented the
taxes laid upon the Netherlands economy by the Spanish government.</p>
<p>The peasantry suffered most and benefited least from the revolt. The
greater part of the land was owned by magnates resembling the feudal
lords of Germany and France, and it was these who organized the struggle
for independence. Philippe de Montmorency, Count of Horn, held vast
tracts in the southern provinces. Lamoral, Count of Egmont, had spaciov
estates in Flanders and Luxembourg, and could afford to marry a Bavar’an
duchess. In several campaigns he fought with such dashing valor that he
be- came a favorite of Charles and Philip; it was he who led Philip’s
army to victory at St.-Quentin ( 1 557) . In his princely palace he
displayed a generous but extravagant hospitality and slipped
embarrassingly into debt. Such men, and many lesser nobles, looked
hungrily upon the wealth of the Church and heard with envy of German
barons who had enriched themselves by seizing ecclesiastical property.*
“They thought that the King would do well to carve a round number of
handsome military commanderies out of the abbey lands,” so creating “a
splendid cavalry … in place of a horde of lazy epic ureans telling
beads.”^</p>
<p>The richest and ablest of the great landowners was William of Nassau,
Prince of Orange. The family owned large properties in the German prov-
ince of Hesse-Nassau and in the district around Wiesbaden as well as in
the Netherlands, while it derived its title from its little principality
of Orange in southern France. Born in German Dillenburg (1533), William
was brought up as a Lutheran till he was eleven; then, to be eligible to
in- herit the lands of his cousin Rene, he was moved to Brussels and
recondi- tioned as a Catholic. Charles V took a fancy to him, secured
for him the hand of Anne of Egmont (heiress of the Count of Buren), and
chose him as chief attendant at the historic abdication in 1355. Philip
sent him — still a youth of twenty-two, but already a master of Flemish,
German, Spanish, French, and Italian — as one of his plenipotentiaries
to negotiate the Peace</p>
<p>438 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Philip made him a state councilor, a Knight of the Golden Fleece, and
stadholder of Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht. But William developed a
mind of his own, and Philip never forgave him.</p>
<p>The young prince had graces of person as well as of purse. He was
tall and athletic, carried no useless weight, and charmed all but his
enemies by his eloquence and courtesy. As a military leader he was a
consistent failure, but as a political strategist his flexible
persistence and patient courage trans- muted his defects into the
establishment of a new state against the opposi- tion of the strongest
political and. religious forces in Europe. He handled men better than
armies, and in the long run this proved the greater gift. His foes
charged him with changing his religion to suit his personal or political
needs.® It was probably so; but all the leaders of that century used
religion as an instrument of policy.* Many found fault with his mar-
riages. His first wife having died, he negotiated for the hand of
another wealthy Anne, daughter of the Protestant Maurice, Elector of
Saxony; he married her with Lutheran rites in 1561, but did not declare
himself a Protestant till 1573. Anne went semi-insane in 1567 and was
deposited with friends. While she was still alive, William secured from
five Protes- tant ministers permission to marry Charlotte de Bourbon, of
the royal house of France (1575), who had fled from a nunnery and had
em-</p>
<p>braced the Reformed faith. She died in 1582. After mourning her for a
year William took a fourth wife, Louise de Coligny, daughter of the ad-
miral who had perished in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Despite —
per- haps because of — these marriages, William was rich only in lands,
poor in money. By 1560 he was almost a million florins in debt.’’“ In a
flurry of economy he dismissed twenty-eight of his cooks.®</p>
<p>Philip fumbled ruinously in handling the Netherlands nobles. His
father, reared in Brussels, knew these men, spoke their language,
managed them judiciously. Philip, brought up in Spain, could speak
neither French nor Dutch; he found it difficult to bend to the magnates
graciously, to respect their customs and their debts; he frowned upon
their extravagance, their drinking, and their easy ways with women;
above all, he could not under- stand their claims to ’check his power.
They on their part disliked his somber pride, his penchant for the
Inquisition, his appointment of Span- iards to lucrative posts in the
Netherlands, his garrisoning of their towns with Spanish troops. When he
asked for funds from the nobles and bus- inessmen who constituted the
States-General, they listened coldly to his plea — through interpreters
— that his father and the recent wars had left the treasury with great
deficits; they were alarmed by his request for 1,300,000 florins and a
further tax of one per cent on realty and two per</p>

<p>cent on movable property; they refused to sanction these levies, but
voted him only such sums as they deemed adequate for current needs.
Three years later he summoned them again and asked for three million
guilders. They yielded, but on condition that all Spanish troops be
withdrawn from the Netherlands. He made this concession, but canceled
its conciliatory effect by getting papal permission to establish eleven
new bishoprics in the Low Countries and nominating to these sees men
willing to enforce his father’s decrees against heresy. When he sailed
for Spain on August 26, 1559, never to see the Netherlands again, the
economic and religious out- lines of the great struggle were taking
form.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MARGARET OF PARMA: 1 559-67</li>
</ol>
<p>Philip had appointed as his regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, a nat-
ural daughter of Charles V by a Flemish mother. She had been brought up
in the Netherlands and, despite long residence in Italy, she could
under- stand the Flemings if not the Dutch. She was neither bigoted nor
intolerant, but was a devout Catholic who, annually in Holy Week, washed
the feet of twelve maidens and gave them marriage dowries. She was an
able and kindly woman, uncomfortably lost in a maelstrom of
revolution.</p>
<p>Her authority was limited by advisers whom Philip had designated.</p>
<p>Egmont and Orange were in her Council of State, but, finding them-
selves consistently outvoted by the three other members, they ceased to
attend. In the resultant triumvirate the dominant personality was
Antoine Perrenot, Bishop of Arras, known to history as Cardinal de
Granvelle. He was a man of good character according to his lights; like
Margaret, he was inclined to peaceful means in dealing with “heresy,”
but he was so dedicated to Catholicism and monarchy that he found it
hard to understand dissent. He and the Regent were handicapped by
Philip’s insistence that no important measure could be taken without the
royal consent, which took weeks to transmit from A-ladrid to Brussels.
The Cardinal sacrificed popularity by obeying the King. He privately
opposed the multiplication of bishoprics, but yielded to Philip’s
insistence that four sees were not enough for seventeen provinces. The
Protestant minority noted with anger that the new bishops were spreading
and intensifying the papal Inquisition. In March 1563 Orange, Egmont,
and Horn, themselves Cath- olics, wrote to Philip charging Granvelle
with violating provincial rights that the King was pledged to maintain;
they thought the Cardinal respon- sible for the new bishops, and they
urged his removal from office. Margaret herself did not relish his
assumption of powers; she longed for some accord with the dissatisfied
nobles, who were important to her in preserving</p>
<p>440</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>social order; finally (September 1563) she too recommended that Gran-
velle be sent to other pastures. After long resistance, Philip yielded,
and invited the lordly minister to enjoy a leave of absence. Granvelle
left Brussels (March 13, 1564), but he continued to be one of the King’s
most trusted counselors. The nobles returned to Margaret’s Council of
State. Some of their appointees sold offices, justice, and pardons, and
tlie Regent seems to have shared in the spoils.®</p>
<p>The Inquisition spread. Philip watched it from Spain, urged it on,
and sent Margaret the names of suspected heretics. Hardly a day passed
with- out an execution. In 1561 Geleyn de Muler was burned at
Audenaarde; Thomas Calberg was burned alive at Tournai; an Anabaptist
was hacked to death with seven blows of a rusty sword in the presence of
his wife, who died with horror at the sight. Enraged by these
barbarities, Bertrand le Bias invaded the cathedral of Tournai during
Christmas Mass, rushed to the altar, snatched the Host from the priest,
trampled it underfoot, and cried out to the congregation, “Misguided
men, do ye take this thing to be Jesus Christ, your Lord and S aviour?”
He was put to torture, his right hand and foot were burned away to the
bone, his tongue was tom out, he was suspended over a fire and was
slowly roasted to death. At Lille Robert Ogier, his wife, and his sons
were burned because they called the worship of the consecrated Host a
blasphemous idolatry.*</p>
<p>The Torquemada of the Netherlands was Peter Titelman, whose methods
were so arbitrary and brutal that the city council of Bruges, all
Catholic, denounced him to the Regent as a barbarian who dragged people
from their homes, tried them without any legal checks, forced them to
say what- ever he wished, and then condemned them to death; and the
magistrates of Flanders, in an earnest address to Philip, begged him to
end these enormities. Marga ret timidly asked the Inquisitor to conduct
himself “with discretion and modesty,” but the executions continued.
Philip supported Titelman, and bade the Regent enforce without mercy or
delay the decrees recently issued by the Council of Trent (1564). The
Council of State protested that several of these decrees violated the
recognized privileges of the provinces, and it suspended their
publication.</p>
<p>William of Orange, anxious to keep the Netherlands united in the
preser- vation of their traditional political liberties, proposed a
policy of toleration far in advance of his time. “The King errs,” he
told the Council of State,</p>
<p>sanguinary edicts. However strongly I am attached to the Catholic
religion, I cannot approve of princes attempting to rule the consciences
of their subjects and wanting to rob them of the liberty of faith.”^^
Catholics</p>
<p>• For these cases we have only Protestant authorities, as quoted in
Motley, Rise of the Dutch Republic^ I, 283-90.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS 44I</p>
<p>joined with Protestants in branding the edicts as tyrannical.^®
Egmont was sent to Madrid to ask for a mitigation of the edicts;
Margaret privately seconded the request. Egmont was feted in Spain, but
came back empty- handed. The bishops of Ypres, Namur, Ghent, and
St.-Omer addressed a petition to Philip (June 1565), begging him to
soften the edicts and “to admonish the people by gentleness and fatherly
love, not by judicial severity.”^® To all such protests Philip replied
that he would rather sacri - fice a hundred thousand lives than change
his policy,®^ and in October 1565 he sent this plain directive to the
agents of the Inquisition:</p>
<p>As to the Inquisition, my will is that it be enforced … as of
old,</p>
<p>and as is required by all law, human and divine. This lies very
near</p>
<p>my heart, and I require you to carry out my orders. Let all con-</p>
<p>demned prisoners be put to death, and suffer them no longer to escape
through the neglect, weakness, and bad faith of the judges. If any are
too timid to execute the edicts, I will replace them by men who have
more heart and zeal.^®</p>
<p>Margaret obeyed Philip and ordered full enforcement of the edicts
(No- vember 14, 1565). Orange and Egmont again withdrew from her
Council. Orange, other nobles, and many magistrates refused to enforce
the edicts. Protestants poured forth pamphlets and broadsheets
denouncing the per- secution. Foreign merchants, sensing revolution in
the air, began to leave the Low Countries. Stores closed, trade
languished, Antwerp seemed dead. Many Netherland Protestants fled to
England or Germany. In England they helped to develop those textile
industries which in the seventeenth century competed with the United
Provinces, and in the eighteenth led the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Many of the lesser nobles secretly adopted the Protestant creed. In
December 1565 some of these — Louis, Count of Nassau (the chivalrous
younger brother of William), Philip van Marnix, Lord of St.-Aldegonde,
his brother Jean van Marnix, Lord of Tholouse, Hendrik, Count of Bre-
derode, and others — met in the palace of the Count of Culemborch in
Brussels, drew up a “Compromise” denouncing the introduction of the
Inquisition into the Netherlands, and formed a league pledged to drive
it from the country. On April 5, 1566, some four hundred of these</p>
<p>minor nobles marched to the palace of the Regent, and presented to
her a “Request” that she ask the King to end the Inquisition and the
edicts in the Netherlands, and that all enforcement of the edicts be
suspended until Philip’s reply was received. Margaret replied that she
would communi - cate their petition to the King, but that she had no
authority to suspend the edicts; however, she would do all in her power
to mitigate their oper-</p>
<p>442 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>ation. One of her councilors, seeing her frightened by the number and
the resolution of the petitioners, reassured her: “What, madam, is your
Highness afraid of these beggars 〔ces gueux’ The confederates defiantly
accepted the name; many of them adopted the coarse gray costume, the
wallet and bowl then characteristic of mendicants; ^’’Vivent les Gueux!”
became the battle cry of the revolution, and for a year it was these
younger nobles who led and nourished the revolt.</p>
<p>Margaret apprised Philip of the “Request” and its wide popula r
support, and renewed her efforts to bring him around to moderation. He
answered in an apparently conciliatory mood (May 6, 1566): he hoped that
heresy could be suppressed without further shedding of blood, and he
promised to visit the Netherlands soon. The Council of State sent to him
Florent de Montmorency, Baron of Montigny, and the Marquis of Bergheon
to rein- force the Regent’s plea. Philip received them handsomely; wrote
to</p>
<p>Margaret (July 31) consenting to the abolition of the episcopal
Inquisition in the Netherlands, and offering a general pardon to all for
whom the Regent should recommend it.</p>
<p>The Calvinists, Lutherans, and Anabaptists of the Netherlands took
ad- vantage of this lull in the storm to bring their worship out in the
open. Protestant refugees returned in considerable number from England,
Ger- many, and Switzerland; preachers of all kinds — ex-monks, learned
theo- logians, ambitious hatters, curriers, and tanners — addressed
large gather- ings of fervent men and women, many of them armed, all
chanting psalms and crying, “Vivent les Gueuxr Near Tournai Ambrose
Wille, who had studied with Calvin, preached to six thousand (June 28,
1566); two days later, on the same spot, another minister addressed ten
thousand; a week later, twenty thousand.^® Half of Flanders seemed to
have gone Protestant. On Sundays the churches and towns were almost
empty while the towns- people attended the Protestant assemblies. When
word went about the province of Holland that the eloquent Peter Gabriel
was to preach at Overeen, near Haarlem, Protestants by the thousands
flocked there and shook the fields with their psalms. Near Antwerp the
Protestant assem- blages numbered fifteen thousand — some said thirty
thousand — nearly every man armed. The Regent ordered the magistrates of
Antwerp to prevent such gatherings as a danger to the state; they
replied that their militia was inadequate and unreliable. Margaret
herself, since the departure of the Spanish garrisons, had no troops at
her disposal. Antwerp was in such turmoil that economic life was
seriously impeded. The Regent asked Wil- liam of Orange to go there and
arrange some peaceful settlement between Catholics and Protestants. He
quieted the strife by persuading the preachers to confine their
assemblies to the suburbs and to keep them unarmed.</p>
<p>In this same month (July 1566) two thousand “Beggars,” led by
Count</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>443</p>
<p>Louis of Nassau, gathered at St.-Trond, in the bishopric of Liege,
and, amid much joyous roistering, laid plans to advance their cause.
They resolved to communicate with German Protestants and to raise among
them an army that would come to the aid of the Netherland Protestants in
case these should be attacked. On July 26 Louis and twelve others,
garbed as beggars, presented to the Regent a demand that she convene the
States- General, and that meanwhile she be guided by Orange, Egmont, and
Horn. Her answer being noncommittal, they intimated that they might be
obliged to seek foreign aid. Louis at once proceeded, with the
connivance of his more cautious brother William, to raise in Germany
four thousand cavalry and forty companies of infantry.^^</p>
<p>On August 9 Philip signed a formal instrument declaring that his
offer of pardon had been wrung from him against his will and did not
bind him, and on August 12 he assured the Pope that the suspension of
the Inquisition was subject to papal approval.’® On August 14 a
Protestant crowd, aroused by preachers who denounced religious images as
idols, broke into one after another of St.- Omer’s churches, smashed the
images and the altars, and destroyed all decorations. In that week
similar mobs ac- complished like denudations in Ypres, Courtrai,
Audenaarde, and Valen- ciennes. At Antwerp, on the sixteenth and
seventeenth, mobs entered the great cathedral, broke up the altars,
shattered stained glass, the cruci- fixes and other images, destroyed
organs, embroideries, chalices, and monstrances, opened sepulchers, and
stripped corpses of ornaments. They drank the sacramental wine, burned
costly missals, and trampled upon mas- terpieces of art. Having sent for
ladders and ropes, they hauled statues down from niches and smashed them
with sledge hammers. Shouting in triumph, the crowd passed through
Antwerp, destroyed the images and ornaments in thirty churches and
monasteries, burned monastic libraries, and drove monks and nuns from
their convents.’® When the news of this “Calvinist Fury” reached Tournai
the iconoclastic ecstasy was let loose there, and every church was
sacked. In Flanders alone four hundred churches were cleansed of their
imagery. At Culemborch the jolly Count presided over the devastation,
and fed his parrots with consecrated Hosts;®® elsewhere some former
priests toasted the wafers on forks.®’ From Flanders the Fury passed
into the northern provinces, to Amsterdam, Leiden, Delft, Utrecht, at
last into Groningen and Friesland. Most Protestant leaders con- demned
these ravages, but some of them, noting that very little violence had
been done to persons, judged the destruction of statues and pictures as
less criminal than the burning of live “heretics.”</p>
<p>Ma rgaret of Parma shrank before this storm. “Anything and everything
is now tolerated in this country,” she wrote to Philip, “except the
Catholic religion.”®® Philip bided his time for revenge, but the Regent,
faced with</p>

<p>(char. XVli</p>
<p>armed mobs and audacious leaders, felt compelled to make concessions.
On August 23 she signed with the representatives of the Gueux an
“Accord” by which Calvinist worship was to be permitted wherever it was
already practiced, on condition that it should not interfere with
Catholic services, and that the Protestants should leave their weapons
at home. The confed- erate spokesmen agreed to disband their league if
the government lived up to this accord. The persecution halted, and for
a moment there was peace.</p>
<p>Neither William of Orange nor the King of Spain was satisfied to
let</p>
<p>matters rest. William saw in the growth of a passionate Protestantism
an instrument with which to win independence for the Netherlands. Though
still nominally a Catholic, he resigned all his state offices, organized
his own system of espionage, and went to Germany (April 22, 1567) to
seek</p>
<p>soldiers and funds. Five days later the Duke of Alva left Spain,
commis- sioned by Philip to raise and use sufficient troops to avenge
the Calvinist riots and stamp out, by uncompromising force, all heresy,
rebellion, and freedom in the Netherlands.</p>

<li>ALVA IN THE NETHERLANDS: 1 567-73</li>
</ol>
<p>Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, or Alva, now fifty-nine</p>
<p>years old, was a figure out of El Greco: straight, tall, thin, with
dark eyes, yellow skin, silver beard. At twenty he had inherited his
illustrious title and extensive estates. He had entered early upon a
military career, in which he distinguished himself by courage,
intelligence, and severity. Philip at- tached him to his innermost
council and listened congenially to his advice. In this emergency his
judgment was that of a soldier trained in Spanish discipline and piety:
crush the rebels without mercy, for every concession strengthens the
opposition. Philip gave him full powers and bade him Godspeed.</p>
<p>Alva crossed to Italy and assembled there, chiefly from Spanish
garri- sons in Naples and Milan, a select army of ten thousand men. He
dressed them in proud splendor, gave them the latest arms and armor, and
solaced them with two thousand prostitutes properly enrolled and
assigned. He led them over the Alps and through Burgundy, Lorraine, and
Luxem- bourg, and entered Brussels on August 22, 1567. Egmont met him
with all submission and a gift of two rare horses. Margaret met him with
regret, feeling that her brother had superseded and overruled her just
when she had restored a humane order. When Alva garrisoned the larger
towns with his Spanish troops she protested, but the Duke coldly
replied, “I am ready to take all the odium upon myself.” Margaret asked
Philip’s permission to resign; he granted it with a comfortable pension,
and in</p>

<p>December she left Brussels for her home in Parma, mourned by the</p>
<p>Catholics, who revered her, and by the Protestants, who foresaw how
mild her greatest rigor would soon appear beside Alva’s calculated
brutality.</p>
<p>The new Regent and Governor General installed himself in the citadel
at Antwerp and prepared to cleanse the Netherlands of heresy. He invited
Egmont and Horn to dinner, feted them, arrested them, and sent them
under strong guard to a castle in Ghent (September 7). He appointed a
“Council of Troubles,” which the terrified Protestants rechristened the
“Council of Blood”; seven of its nine members were Netherlanders, two
were Spaniards; but only these two had a vote, and Alva reserved to him-
self the final decision in any case that specially interested him. He
ordered the council to ferret out and arrest all persons suspected of
opposition to the Catholic Church or the Spanish government, to try them
privately, and to punish the convicted without tenderness or delay.
Agents were sent out to spy; informers were encouraged to betray their
relatives, their enemies, their friends. Emigration was forbidden;
shipmasters aiding emigration were to be hanged.<em>® Every town that
had failed to stop or punish rebellion was held guilty, and its
oflScials were imprisoned or fined. Thousands of arrests were made; in
one morning some 1,500 per- sons were seized in their beds and carried
off to jail. Trials were summary. Condemnations to death were sometimes
voted upon groups of thirty, forty, or fifty at a time.</em>^ In one
month (January 1568) eighty-four</p>
<p>residents of Valenciennes were executed. Soon there was hardly a
family in Flanders that did not mourn a member arrested or killed by the
Council of Troubles. Scarcely anyone in the Netherlands dared protest;
the slight- est criticism would have meant arrest.</p>
<p>Alva felt his success tarnished by inability to lure William of
Orange</p>
<p>within his reach. The Council of Troubles drew up an indictment of
the Prince, his brother Louis, his brother-in-law Count van den Berg,
the Baron of Montigny, and other leaders as having encouraged heresy and
revolt. Montigny was still in Spain; Philip had him jailed. William’s
son, Philip William, Count of Buren, was a student in the University of
Lou- vain; he was arrested, was sent to Spain, and was brought up as a
fervent Catholic, who repudiated his father’s principles. William was
declared an outlaw whom anyone might kill with legal impunity.</p>
<p>He proceeded with the organization of an army, and directed his
brother Louis to do likewise. He asked aid of the Lutheran princes, who
responded feebly, and of Queen Elizabeth, who held back cautiously; sums
came to him from Antwerp, Amsterdam, Leiden, Haarlem, Flushing; Counts
van den Berg, Culemborch, and Hoogstraaten sent 30,000 florins each; he
himself sold his jewelry, plate, tapestries, and rich furniture and con-
tributed 50,000 florins. Soldiers were plentiful, for mercenaries

<p>by a lull in the religious wars of France had returned to Germany
penniless. Toleration was a necessary policy for William: he had to win
Lutherans as well as Calvinists to his banner, and he had to assure the
Catholics of the Netherlands that their worship would not be impeded by
liberation from Spain.</p>
<p>He planned simultaneous action by three armies. A force of Huguenots
from France was to attack Artois in the southwest; Hoogstraaten was to
lead his men against Maastricht in the south; Louis of Nassau was to
enter Friesland from Germany in the northeast. The Huguenot and
Hoog-</p>
<p>straaten invasions were repulsed, but Louis won a victory over the
Spanish soldiery at Heiligerlee (May 23, 1568). Alva ordered the
execution of Egmont and Horn (June 5) to release for action the 3,000
troops that had guarded them and Ghent. With these reinforcements he
advanced into Friesland, overwhelmed Louis’ weakened army at Jemmingen
(July</p>
<p>21), and killed 7,000 men. Louis escaped by swimming an estuary of
the Ems. In October William led 25,000 men into Brabant, resolved to
meet Alva in a decisive battle. Alva, with men less numerous but better
dis- ciplined, outgeneraled him, and avoided battle except in
destructive rear- guard attacks. William’s troops, unpaid, refused to
fight. He led them to safety in France and disbanded them. Then,
disguised as a peasant, he made his way from France to Germany, where he
moved from one town to another to avoid assassination. With these
disastrous campaigns began the “Eighty Years’ War” waged with
unprecedented perseverance by the Netherlands till their final triumph
in 1648.</p>
<p>Alva was for the time proud master of the field, but he too was
penni- less. Philip had arranged with Genoese bankers to send Alva, by
sea, 450,000 ducats; but the vessels were forced by English privateers
into Ply- mouth harbor, and Elizabeth, not averse to helping William for
such a fee, seized the money with the blandest of apologies. Alva
summoned the States-General of nobles and burgesses to Brussels, and
proposed to them (March 20, 1569) an immediate tax of one per cent to be
levied upon all property, a perpetual tax of 5 per cent on every
transfer of</p>
<p>realty, and a perpetual tax of 10 per cent on every sale. The
assembly protested that since many articles changed ownership several
times a year, such a sales tax would approach confiscation. It referred
the proposals to the provincial assemblies, and there the opposition was
so bitter that Alva had to defer the 10 per cent tax till 1572, and
content himself meanwhile with the one per cent tax and a grant of two
million florins yearly for two years. Even the one per cent tax was hard
and costly to collect.</p>
<p>Utrecht refused to pay it; a regiment of soldiery was qWrtered upon
the households; resistance continued; Alva declared the whole district
trea- sonous, abolished its charters and privileges, and confiscated all
the prop- erty of the inhabitants for the King.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>It was this taxation, and the measures taken to enforce it, that
defeated the hitherto undefeated Alva. Now nearly the entire population.
Catholic as well as Protestant, opposed him, and with rising anger as
his imposi- tions hampered and discouraged the business activity upon
which the Netherlands had built their prosperity. More skilled in war
than in finance, Alva retaliated for Elizabeth’s appropriation of the
Genoese funds by seizing English property in the Netherlands and
forbidding trade with England. Elizabeth thereupon confiscated
Netherland goods in England and diverted English trade to Hamburg. Soon
the Netherlands felt the torpor of commercial decay. Shops closed,
unemployment mounted, and the powerful business classes, which had borne
so patiently the hanging of Protestants and the sacking of churches,
secretly meditated, at last financed, revolt. Even the Catholic clergy,
fearing the collapse of the national economy, turned against Alva and
warned Philip that the Duke was ruining the state.^“ Pope Pius V, who
had rejoiced over Alva’s vic - tories, joined with Cardinal de Granvelle
in deploring Alva’s severity,^® and recommended a general amnesty to all
repentant rebels and heretics. Philip agreed and so notified Alva
(February 1569), but the Duke asked for delay, and the amnesty was not
proclaimed till July 16, 1570. In that year the Pope bestowed the
blessed hat and sword upon Alva and the Golden Rose upon Alva’s wife,^*^
and Philip put the imprisoned Adontigny to death (October 16, 1570).</p>
<p>Meanwhile a new force had entered upon the scene. In March 1568 a
band of desperate men known as the Wild Beggars turned their ardor to
pillaging churches and monasteries and cutting off the noses or ears of
priests and monks, as if resolved to rival the barbarities of the
Council of Blood.^® In 1569-72 another group, calling themselves Beggars
of the Sea, seized control of eighteen vessels, received commissions
from William of Orange, raided the Netherland coast, plundered churches
and monas- teries, preyed upon Spanish shipping, and replenished their
provisions in friendly English ports — and even in distant La Rochelle,
then held by Huguenots. Wherever a coastal town was left without a
Spanish garrison, the Beggars of the Sea rushed in, captured strategic
posts, and, by their power to open the dykes, made it dangerous for
Spanish forces to ap- proach. Alva could no longer receive supplies by
sea. The principal cities of Holland, Zeeland, Gelderland, and
Friesland, so protected, gave their allegiance to William of Orange and
voted him supplies for war (July</p>
<p>1572). William moved his headquarters to Delft and declared himself
‘^calvus et Calvinista^’’ bald and Calvinist, which was truer of his
head than of his creed. Now Philip van Marnix wrote the song “Wilhelmus
van Nassouwen,” which became and still is the national hymn of the
Nether- lands.</p>
<p>So encouraged, William organized another army and invaded
Brabant.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>At the same time Louis of Nassau, supported by Coligny, raised a
force in France, entered Hainaut, and captured Valenciennes and Mons
(May 23, 1572). Alva marched to recapture Mons, hoping thereby to
discourage further support of Louis by France. William advanced
southward to help his brother; he won some minor victories, but too soon
exhausted his funds; his troops paid themselves by plundering churches
and amused themselves by killing priests.®* Catholic opposition rose;
when William’s army neared Brussels it found the gates closed and the
citizens armed to resist. Resuming its march, it was but a league from
Mons when it was surprised in its sleep by six hundred Spanish soldiers;
eight hundred of William’s men were slaughtered before they could
organize for defense; William himself barely escaped, fleeing with a
remnant of his forces to A-Iechlin in Brabant. Meanwhile the murder of
Coligny and the Massacre of St. Bartholomew ended all hope of aid from
France. On September 17 Mons fell to Alva, who allowed Louis and his
surviving troops to leave unharmed; but Alva’s general, Philippe de
Novarmes, on his own author - ity, hanged hundreds of the inhabitants,
confiscated their property, and bought it in at bargain rates.®*</p>
<p>William’s failure in strategy, the excesses of his uncontrollable
troops, and the barbarities of the Beggars frustrated his hopes of
uniting Catholics, Calvinists, and Lutherans to oppose Alva’s tyranny.
The Beggars, who were nearly all ardent Calvinists, showed against
Catholics the same feroc- ity that the Inquisition and the Council of
Blood had shown against</p>
<p>rebels and heretics. In many instances they gave Cathohc captives a
choice between Calvinism and death, and they unhesitatingly killed,
sometimes after incredible tortures, those who clung to the old faith.®^
Both sides in the conflict put to death many prisoners of war. Wrote a
Protestant his- torian:</p>
<p>On more than one occasion men were seen hanging . . . their own</p>
<p>brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy’s ranks. . .
.</p>
<p>The islanders found a fierce pleasure in these acts of cruelty. A</p>
<p>Spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes. On one occasion a</p>
<p>surgeon at Veer cut the heart from a Spanish prisoner, nailed it on a
vessel’s prow, and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their</p>
<p>teeth in it, which many did with savage satisfaction.*®</p>
<p>It was these merciless Beggars who defeated Alva. Resting from
his</p>
<p>campaigns, he bequeathed to his son Don Federigo Alvarez de Toledo
the task of recovering and punishing the cities that had declared for
William or had surrendered to him. Alvarez began with Mechlin, which
offered only a few shots of resistance; priests and citizens came out in
a penitent procession to beg that the town be spared. But Alva had</p>
<p>CHAP. XVll) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>ordered an exemplary revenge. For three days Don Federigo’s troops
sacked homes, monasteries, and churches, stole the jewels and costly
robes of religious statuary, trampled consecrated wafers underfoot,
butchered men and violated women. Catholic or Protestant. Advancing into
Gelder- land, his army overcame the feeble defenses of Zutphen, put
nearly every man in the town to death, hanging some by the feet,
drowning five</p>
<p>hundred by tying them in couples back to back and throwing them into
the Ijssel. Little Naarden, after a brief resistance, surrendered; it
greeted the conquering Spaniards with tables set with feasts; the
soldiers ate and drank, then killed every person in the town. They
passed on to Haarlem, a Calvinist center which had shown especial
enthusiasm for the revolt. A garrison of four thousand troops defended
the city so resolutely that Don Federigo proposed to withdraw. Alva
threatened to disown him if he desisted from the siege. Barbarities
multiplied; each side hanged captives on gibbets facing the enemy, and
the defenders infuriated the besiegers by staging on the ramparts
parodies of Catholic rites.®* William sent three thousand men to attack
Don Federigo’s army; they were destroyed, and :all further efforts to
relieve Haarlem failed. After a siege of seven months, and after being
reduced to eating weeds and leather, the city surrendered ((July II,
1573). Of the garrison only 1,600 survived; most of these were put to
death; four hundred leading citizens were executed; the rest were spared
on agreeing to pay a fine of 250,000 guilders.</p>
<p>This was the last and most costly victory of Alva’s regime. Over</p>
<p>twelve thousand of the besieging army had died of wounds or disease,
and hateful taxes had poured their proceeds fruitlessly into the sieve
of war. Philip, who counted pennies rather than lives, discovered that
Alva was not only unpopular but expensive, and that his general’s
methods were uniting the Netherlands against Spain. Alva felt the
veering of the wind and asked to be relieved. He boasted that he had
executed eighteen thousand rebels;®^ but the heretics were as strong as
when he came; more- over, they controlled the ports and the sea, and the
provinces of Holland and Zeeland were completely lost to the King. The
Bishop of Namur estimated that Alva in seven years had done more harm to
Catholicism than Luther and Calvinism had done in a generation.®® Alva’s
resignation was accepted; he left the Netherlands (December 18, 1573),
was well received by Philip, and, aged seventy-two, led the Spanish
armies in the ■ conquest of Portugal (1580). Returning from that
campaign, he fell into ;a lingering fever, and was kept alive only by
drinking milk from a woman’s Ibreast. He died December 12, 1582, having
lived a year on milk and half ;a century on blood.</p>

<li>REQUESENS AND DON JUAN: 1 573-78</li>
</ol>
<p>To replace him Philip sent Don Luis de Requesens, lately Spanish</p>
<p>Viceroy of Milan. The new governor was surprised by the number and
the spirit of the rebels. “Before my arrival,” he wrote to the King,
“I</p>
<p>did not understand how they could maintain such considerable fleets,
while your Majesty could not support a single one. It appears, however,
that men who are fighting for their lives, their firesides, their
property, and their false religion — for their own cause, in short — are
contented to receive rations only, without receiving pay.”®^ He begged
Philip to allow him to grant a general amnesty to all but persisting
heretics, to allow these to emigrate, and to abolish the 10 per cent tax
on sales. William of Orange saw in these proposals merely a play for
time and a new device for ex- tirpating Protestantism from the
Netherlands; he would accept peace only on full freedom of worship, the
restoration of provincial privileges, and the withdrawal of all
Spaniards from civil and military posts. The war continued. In the
battle of Mook (April 13, 1574) William’s br others Louis, aged
thirty-six, and Henry, aged twenty-four, lost their lives.</p>
<p>Two events helped the revolt at this point: Philip went bankrupt
(1575), and Requesens died while besieging Zierikzee (March 5, 1576).
The</p>
<p>King appointed his half-brother, Don Juan of Austria, to the
ungrateful post, but Juan did not reach Luxembourg till November. During
this</p>
<p>interval the representatives of Holland and Zeeland signed at Delft
(April</p>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li>an Act of Pacification, which gave William supreme command on land
and sea, the power of appointment to all political posts, and even, in
emergency, the right to confer the protectorate of the confederation
upon a foreign prince. Speaking with his new authority, he appealed to
the other provinces to join in expelling the Spaniards from the Nether-
lands. He promised liberty of conscience and worship to Catholics and
Protestants alike.</li>
</ol>
<p>His appeal would probably have met with little response in the
southern provinces had not the Spanish soldiery, cheated of pillage at
Zierikzee, mutinied (July) and begun a campaign of indiscriminate
plunder and violence that terrorized Flanders and Brabant. The Council
of State at Brussels reprimanded them; they defied it; the Council
declared them outlaws, but had no force to oppose them. William offered
to send military protection, and renewed his pledge of religious
freedom. The Council hesitated; the people of Brussels overthrew it and
set up another Council under Philippe de Croy, who opened negotiations
with the Prince. On September 26 Ghent welcomed a body of troops sent by
William to pro- tect it from the Spanish mutineers. On October 1 9
delegates from Brabant,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS 451</p>
<p>Flanders, and Hainaut met at Ghent; they were reluctant to ally their
states with the outlawed Prince; but on the twentieth the mutineers
sacked Maastricht; on the twenty-eighth the conferees, to secure the
protection of William’s troops, signed the “Pacification of Ghent,”
which recognized him as governor of Holland and Zeeland, suspended all
persecution for heresy, and agreed to co-operate in expelling all
Spanish soldiers from their provinces. The States-General of the
southern provinces, meeting at Brussels, refused to sign the
Pacification, considering it a declaration of war against the King.</p>
<p>Once more the mutineers reinforced William’s arguments. On Novem -
ber 4, 1576, they seized Antwerp and subjected it to the worst pillage
in Netherland history. The citizens resisted, but were overcome; seven
thousand of them were killed; a thousand buildings, some of them master-
pieces of architecture, were set on fire; men, women, and children were
slaughtered in a delirium of blood by soldiers cry ing, “Santiago!
Espana! A sangre, a came, a fuego, a saccoT (Saint James! Spain! To
blood, to flesh, to fire, to sack!) All through that night the soldiers
plundered the rich city; nearly every house was robbed. To extort
confessions of hidden hoards, real or imaginary, parents were tortured
in their children’s pres - ence, infants were slain in their mother’s
arms, wives were flogged to death before their husbands’ eyes. For two
days more this “Spanish Fury” raged on, until the soldiers were sated
with gold and jewelry and costly clothing, and began to gamble their
gains with one another in streets still littered with the dead. On
November 28 the States-General ratified the Pacification of Ghent.</p>
<p>It was a timely victory for the Prince. When Don Juan sent word</p>
<p>from Luxembourg that he was about to enter Brussels, the
States-General replied that it would not receive him as governor unless
he accepted the Pacification, restored the charters of the provinces,
and dismissed all Spanish troops from the Netherlands. The Don, brave in
battle, muddled in diplomacy, soldierless and penniless, fretted the
winter through in Luxembourg, then (February 12, 1577) signed the
“Perpetual Edict,”</p>
<p>which committed him to the Pacification and the provincial liberties.
On March i Juan made a ceremonial entry into Brussels, and the city was
delighted to have so handsome and powerless a governor. The Spanish
troops departed, and peace smiled for a moment upon the ravaged
land.</p>
<p>Juan’s dreams w ere larger than his purse. After his exploits at
Lepanto and Tunis this helpless majesty chilled his romantic blood.
Nearby, in England, the lovely Mary Stuart was a prisoner of that ogress
Elizabeth. Why not collect an army and some ships, cross the water,
depose one queen, marry the other, be king of England and Scotland, and
bring those benighted regions back to Another Church? Philip, who feared
the gap</p>
<p>452</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>between ducats and dreams, set his brother down as a fool. Juan
proved it by suddenly leaving Brussels (June ii), putting himself at the
head</p>
<p>of a Catholic Walloon regiment, and repudiating the Pacification.
After fruitless negotiations with Juan, the States-General invited
William to the capital. On his arrival (September 23) he was welcomed by
a large part of the Catholic citizenry as the only man who could lead
the Nether- lands to freedom. On October 8 the States-General notified
Don Juan that it no longer recognized him as governor, but would accept,
in his place, a prince of the blood. On December 10, 1577, all the
provinces except Namur bound themselves together in the “Union of
Brussels.” The Catholic members of the States-General, fearing William’s
Calvinism, asked Matthias, Archduke of Austria, to accept the government
of the Netherlands. The youth of twenty came and was installed (January
18,</p>
<p>1578), but William’s supporters persuaded the new governor to appoint
him as his lieutenant — actually the master of administration and
policy.</p>
<p>Only mutual toleration of religious diversity could have preserved
this association, and intolerance shattered it. The Calvinists of
Holland, like the Catholics of Spain, held that only unbelievers could
practice tolera- tion. Many of them openly called William of Orange an
atheist.®® The</p>
<p>Calvinist preacher Peter Dathenus charged him with making the state
his god and changing his religion as others changed their clothes.®* The
Calvinists were (and till 1587 remained) only a tenth of the population
in the province of Holland, but they were active and ambitious, and they
were armed. They won control of the political assemblies; they replaced
Catholic with Protestant magistrates; in 1573 the Estates, or provincial
council, forbade all Catholic worship in Holland,^® on the ground that
every Catholic was a potential servant of Spain. By 1578 Calvinism was
almost universal in Zeeland, and was politically — not numerically —
domi- nant in Friesland. Waves of image-breaking swept over Holland and
Zeeland in 1572, and after 1576 in other provinces, even in Flanders and
Brabant. All association of religion with art was repudiated as
idolatrous or profane. Churches were stripped of pictures, statues,
crucifixes, and decoration; gold and silver vessels were melted down;
bare walls re- mained. The Beggars tortured Catholic priests and put
some to death</p>
<p>William condemned these procedures, but connived<em>® at the seizure
of political power by armed Calvinist minorities in Brussels, Ypres,
Bruges, and all northern Flanders.</em>® At Ghent the victorious
Calvinists imprisoned the councilors, sacked and gutted churches and
monasteries, confiscated ecclesiastical property, prohibited all
Catholic services, burned monks in the market place,** and set up a
revolutionary republic (1577). At Am- sterdam (May 24, 1578) armed
Calvinists entered the town hall, banished the magistrates, replaced
them with Calvinists, and gave the denuded</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>45 ^</p>
<p>churches to the Reformed worship. On the following day a similar up-
rising transformed Haarlem. At Antwerp, which was now William’s head -
quarters, the Protestants drove priests and monks from the city (May
28); the Prince berated his followers for their violence and
persuaded</p>
<p>them to let Catholic services be resumed, but in 1581 all Catholic
worship was forbidden in Antwerp and Utrecht. The Calvinists charged
that the priests had deceived the people with bogus relics and
manipulated miracles — exhibiting fragments of the “true cross,” holding
up old bones for adoration as those of saints, and secreting oil in the
heads of statues to make them opportunely sweat.*®</p>
<p>William mourned to see his years of labor for unity ending in
division, chaos, and hate. The Calvinist democracy that had captured
several cities was falling into such anarchy that men of property,
Protestant as well as Catholic, began to wonder whether the new
dispensation was not, for them, worse than the old, placards and all.
William met this rising demand for order by negotiating with Frangois,
Duke of Anjou, to take over the governorship from the incompetent and
negligible Matthias, but Anjou proved treacherous and worthless. As a
culminating misfortune for the Prince, a new Spanish army of twenty
thousand well-trained men was marching north under the ablest general of
the age. In December 1577 Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma, brought his
army to Don Juan in Luxembourg. On January 31, 1578, they defeated the
undisciplined forces of the States-General at Gembloux. Louvain and a
dozen minor towns opened their gates to the new conqueror. The
States-General of the Nether- lands fled from Brussels to Antwerp. Don
Juan, smelling new glory,</p>
<p>caught a malignant fever, and died at Namur October i, 1578, aged
thirty- three. Philip appointed Farnese governor general, and a new
chapter began.</p>
<p>V. PARMA AND ORANGE: 1 578-84</p>
<p>Alessandro Farnese, now thirty-three, was the son of the former
Regent, Margaret of Parma. Brought up in Spain, he swore loyalty to
Philip,</p>
<p>fought at Lepanto, and gave the last fourteen years of his life to
saving the southern Netherlands for the King. In 1586 he was to inherit
the duchy of Parma and its title, but he never took the ducal throne.
Sharp eyes, dark features, cropped black hair, eagle nose, and bushy
beard re- vealed only a part of his ability, courage, and subtlety. He
had all the military art of Alva, less of his cruelty, immeasurably more
skill in nego- tiation and address. The battle for the Netherlands now
became a duel between the Duke of Parma’s diplomacy and arms, supported
by Catholic funds and hopes, and the heroic perseverance of the Prince
of Orange,</p>

of his friends.</p>
<p>On January 5, 1579, a group of Catholic nobles from Hainaut, Douai,
Artois, and Lille, inspired by the Bishop of Arras, formed the League of
Arras for the protection of their religion and property. On January 29
the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Groningen, Utrecht, and Gelderland
formed the Union of Utrecht for the defense of their faith and
liberties; soon they were joined by Friesland and Overijssel; these
seven “United Provinces” became the Dutch Netherlands of today. The
remaining prov - inces became the “Spanish Netherlands” and, in the
nineteenth century, Belgium. The division of the seventeen provinces
into two nations was determined partly by the predominance of
Catholicism in the south and of Protestantism in the north, but also by
the geographical separation of the lowlands by the great inlets and
rivers which, by their breadth and their controllable dykes, offered
defensible ports and barriers to Spanish fleets and arms.</p>
<p>On May 19 the League of Arras signed an agreement with Parma by which
it bound itself to tolerate no religion but the Catholic, and accepted
Spanish sovereignty on condition that the privileges of the provinces
and communes should be restored. By persuasion, bribery, or force, the
Duke soon regained almost all the southern provinces for Spain. The
Calvinist leaders at Brussels, Ghent, and Ypres abandoned their
conquests and fled to the Protestant north. On March 12, 1579, Parma led
a large army against Maastricht, strategically situated on the river
from which it took its name. Prodigies of heroism and barbarity were
performed on both sides. The attackers dug miles of subterranean
passages to mine and invade the city; the defenders — women joining the
men — dug passages to meet them, and battles were fought to the death in
the bowels of the earth. Boiling water was poured into the tunnels,
fires were lit to fill them with smoke; hun- dreds of besiegers were
scalded or choked to death. One of Parma’s mines, exploding prematurely,
killed five hundred of his men. When his soldiers tried to scale the
wall they were met with firebrands, and burning pitch- hoops were
quoited around their necks. After four months of effort and fury, the
besiegers made a breach in the wall, entered through it silently at
night, caught the exhausted defenders sleeping, and massacred 6,000 men,
women and children. Of the city’s 30,000 population only 400 now
survived. Parma repeopled it with Walloon Catholics.</p>
<p>It was a major disaster for the Protestant cause. William, who had
tried in vain to succor the city, was with some reason blamed for
incompetence and delay. The same extremists who had frustrated his
unifying policies by their intolerance and violence now charged him with
treason to their cause in his negotiations with the Catholic Duke of
Anjou, and they</p>

<p>pointed out that he had attended no religious service during the past
year. Philip seized the moment to promulgate a ban (March 15, 1581)
against Orange. After detailing all the ingratitude, disloyalty,
marriages, and crimes of the Prince, he proceeded:</p>
<p>Therefore . . . for all his evil doings as chief disturber of the
public</p>
<p>peace, and as a public pest, we outlaw him forever, and forbid all
our subjects to associate with him or communicate with him in public or
in secret, or to administer to him victuals, drink, fire, or other
neces- saries. We declare him an enemy of the human race and give
his</p>
<p>property to all who may seize it. In order the sooner to remove
our</p>
<p>people from his tyranny and oppression, we promise, on the word of a
king and as God’s servant, that if one of our subjects be found so</p>
<p>generous of heart . . . that he shall find means of executing this
decree and ridding us of the said pest, either by delivering him to us
dead or alive, or by depriving him at once of life, we will give him and
his</p>
<p>heirs landed property or money, as he will, to the amount of 25,000
gold crowns. If he has committed any crime, of any kind whatsoever, we
will pardon him. If he be not noble we will ennoble him.^^</p>
<p>The provincial Estates replied to this ban by appointing William
stad- holder, or chief magistrate, of Holland and Zeeland (July 24,
1581); and two days later the representatives of Holland, Zeeland,
Gelderland, Utrecht, Flanders, and Brabant signed at the Hague an “Act
of Abjuration” solemnly renouncing allegiance to the King of Spain. In a
document as famous in Dutch history as Parliament’s Declaration of
Rights (1689) history</p>
<p>of England, they proclaimed that a ruler who treats his subjects as
slaves and destroys their liberties should no longer be accounted their
legitimate sovereign, and may lawfully be deposed.’*’ William’s own
reply to the ban took the form of an Apologia written for him by his
chaplain and sent to the States-General and to every European court. He
welcomed the ban as a dis- tinction. He charged Philip with incest,
adultery, and the murder of his own wife and son. He expressed his
readiness to resign his offices, to with- draw from the Netherlands,
even to surrender his life, if he might thereby benefit his country. He
signed the document with his motto, 〕e main- tiendrai — “1 will hold
fast.”</p>
<p>Soon afterward (March 18, 1582) Philip reaped the first fruits of the
ban. Jean Jaureguy, spurred on by the promised reward, armed himself
with a pistol, begged God’s help, promised the Virgin a portion of his
spoils, made his way to William of Orange at Antwerp, and shot him
through the head. The bullet entered under the right ear, passed through
the palate, and emerged through the left cheek. The assassin was caught
and killed at once by William’s attendant s, but the mission seemed
accom-</p>
<p>45&lt;5 the age of reason begins (chap, xvii</p>
<p>plished; for weeks the Prince seemed near death. Farnese invited the
rebel provinces, now that their obstinate leader was dead, to make their
peace with their merciful King. But William slowly recovered under the
de- voted care of his wife Charlotte, who died of exhaustion and fever
on May 5. In July two obscure conspirators laid a plan to poison both
the Prince of Orange and the Duke of Anjou; the plot was detected and
the criminals were arrested; one killed himself in jail, the other was
sent to Paris, was tried and found guilty, and was tom to pieces by
means of four horses.</p>
<p>During this year 1582 Anjou collected some French soldiers about</p>
<p>him at Antwerp. Dissatisfied with his ducal title, he dreamed of
making himself a king. Suddenly, on January 17, 1583, his followers,
shouting “Long live the Mass!” attempted to seize control of the city.
The people resisted them; nearly two thousand lives were lost in this
“French Fury”; the uprising failed, Anjou fled, and William suffered
further loss of</p>
<p>popularity for having so long supported him. In March another attempt
was made upon his life. Feeling unsafe in Antwerp, he moved his head-
quarters to Delft. The provinces of Groningen and Gelderland now made
their peace with Parma. Only two of the “united” provinces still adhered
to William, but these two, Holland and Zeeland, testified their loyalty
by making the stadholdership hereditary in his family (December 1583).
So were laid the foundations of the house of Orange, which in 1688 would
half conquer, half inherit, England.</p>
<p>Assassins persisted. In April 1584 Hans Hanszoon of Flushing tried to
blow up the Prince; he failed and was put to death. Balthasar Gerard, of
Burgundy, burned with religious zeal and the thought of twenty-five
thousand crowns.* Going to the Duke of Parma, he offered to kill the
Prince of Orange. Parma judged the youth of twenty unfit for such an
enterprise, refused him the modest advance requested, but promised him
the full reward if he succeeded.^® Gerard went to Delft, disguised
himself as a poor and pious Calvinist, received an alms of twelve crowns
from William, and poured three bullets into the Princ e’s body (July 10,
1584). William cried, “My God, have pity on my soul. . . . Have pity on
this</p>
<p>poor people.” He died within a few minutes. G6rard was caught, was
tried by the city magistrates, expressed joy over his success, and was
put to extreme torture and death. William was buried at Delft with the
highest honors as “Father of His Country.” Having sacrificed nearly all
his be - longings in promotion of the revolt, he left his twelve
children almost penniless — a silent testimony of the nobility into
which he had matured.</p>
<p>The full reward was paid to Gerard’s parents. The Catholics of

<p>Netherlands rejoiced, calling the crime God’s vengeance for the
desecra - tion of churches and the murder of priests. They sent the

they labored to have him declared a saint.^®</p>

<p>The death of their leader broke the spirit of such followers as
William still had in Flanders and Brabant. Parma took Bruges, Ghent,
Brussels, Mechlin, Antwerp; by the end of 1585 all the Netherlands south
of the Maas — except Ostend and Sluys — had fallen to Spain. The
Beggars, how- ever, still controlled the ports and the sea.</p>
<p>The northern provinces had repeatedly appealed to Elizabeth for aid.
Now she responded. She knew that the revolt of the Netherlands had kept
Spain from declaring war upon England; she could not afford to have that
blessing cease; moreover, the Dutch controlled the market for English
wool. In December 1585 she sent to Holland a substantial force under
Leicester and Sir Philip Sidney. Leicester, as governor general of the
rebel provinces, assumed almost sovereign power. Seeing that the
southern provinces imported the necessaries of life from the northern,
he forbade all trade with any Spanish possession. But the Dutch
merchants lived on that trade; they exported goods to Spain during their
war with Spain; they refused to obey Leicester’s prohibitions. Defeated
at Zutphen (September 22, 1586), Leicester left Holland in disgrace and
disgust. For a year chaos reigned in the north. The little republic was
saved by Parma’s absorption in Philip’s plan for the invasion of
England; by Parma’s diver - sions against Henry of Navarre in France; by
Dutch control of the</p>
<p>waters; by the wealth and the persistence of the Dutch merchants; by
the political genius of Jan van Oldenbarneveldt; and by the military
genius of Maurice of Nassau, William the Silent’s son.</p>
<p>Soon after his father ’s death, Maurice was chosen stadholder of
Holland and Zeeland. In 1588, aged twenty-one, he was made captain
general and admiral of the United Provinces. In 1590 Utrecht,
Overijssel, and Gelder- land conferred their stadholderships upon him.
Profiting from the Leiden lectures of Simon Stevin on mathematics,
Maurice applied the latest science to ballistics, engineering, and
siege. He trained the Dutch army to new cohesion and discipline. In a
series of campaigns (1590-94) remarkable for swift movement and
surprising strategy, he recaptured Zutphen, Deventer, Nijmegen, and
Groningen. Parma, having wasted his skill and funds in Philip’s vain
sallies against England and Henry IV, died at Spa of exhaustion and
wounds (February 20, 1592).</p>
<p>To succeed him Philip appointed Archduke Ernest of Austria, who</p>
<p>458 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>soon died; then Cardinal Archduke Albert, who resigned his religious
dignities and married the King’s daughter Isabel Clara Eugenia. Shortly
before his own death (1598), Philip bestowed upon Albert and Isabel
sovereign rights in the Netherlands, with the proviso that if they died
childless the sovereignty was to revert to Spain. They proved to be
capable and kindly rulers, unable to subdue the northern provinces, but
establishing in the south a civilized regime under which ecclesiastical
arts flourished in genial harmony with Rubens’ nudes.</p>
<p>A new figure appeared upon the scene in 1603. Albert had besieged
Ostend for two years without success. An Italian banker, Ambrosio de
Spinola, placed his fortune at the service of Spain, raised and equipped
a force of eight thousand men, besieged and took Ostend. But even his
immense riches could not offset the wealth of the Dutch merchants. They
persisted in building and financing fleets that harassed Spanish
shipping and threatened the line of gold between America and Spain.
Tired of blockade and slaughter, Albert and Isabel urged negotiations
with the Dutch, and Philip III, tired of bankruptcy, consented.
Oldenbarneveldt, over the protests of Maurice, persuaded the Dutch to
conciliation. A truce was signed (1609) that gave the Netherlands twelve
years’ rest from war.</p>
<p>Internal concord varies inversely with external peace. Maurice
resented the dominance of Oldenbarneveldt in the affairs of the
republic. Tech- nically the grand pensionary — chief paid official — of
Holland had authority in that province alone; but since Holland had as
much wealth, and paid to the States-General as much in taxes, as all the
rest of the United Prov- inces together, he wielded in the federation a
power commensurate with that weallth, and with the force of his mind and
character. Moreover, the landowners who ruled the provinces and the rich
merchants who ruled the communes felt drawn to Oldenbarneveldt, who,
like them, rejected democracy. “Better overlorded,” he said, “than ruled
by a mob.”®“</p>
<p>Maurice, turning to the people for support, found that he could win
them if he made the Calvinist ministers his friends.</p>
<p>The religious issue that now inflamed the republic was threefold; the
growing opposition between Church and state, the conflict between
Catholics and Protestants, and the war of doctrine within the Protestant
fold. Calvinist synods sought to determine political policy and to use
the government as an agent for the enforcement of their creed; the
States- General distrusted the Calvinist congregations as dangerous
examples and seedplots of democracy, and Oldenbarneveldt made many
enemies by bidding the clergy leave government to the civil powers.
Strange to say, even in the northern provinces the population in 1609
was still predom- inantly Catholic.®^ The laws forbade Catholic worship,
but were not</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>enforced; 232 priests conducted Catholic services.®* The provincial
council of Utrecht ordered the priests to marry their housekeepers, but
compliance was sporadic and spiritless.</p>
<p>Within the Protestant communities the struggle lay between the Cal-
vinists and a minority of “libertines.” The latter were so called not as
loose livers but as favoring religious liberty, even for Catholics, and
a liberal and humane interpretation of the Protestant theology. These
heirs of the Erasmian tradition (to whom William of Orange had belonged)
were de- nounced as secret “papists” by the Precisians, or orthodox
Calvinists, who adhered to strict predestinarianism and felt that their
faith should be made compulsory throughout the United Provinces.®® Dirck
Coornhert, who had served as secretary to the Prince of Orange, argued
for freedom of worship in writings that established the literary
language of Holland. An Amsterdam preacher. Jacobus Arminius, was
assigned to refute Coorn- hert’s views; he was converted to them as he
studied to answer them, and when he was appointed professor of theology
at Leiden he shocked the Precisians by questioning predestination and
asserting, against Luther and Calvin, that man is saved by good works as
well as faith. He admitted that virtuous heathen might escape hell, and
surmised that in the end all men would be saved. His fellow professor
Franciscus Gomarus branded him an insidious heretic.</p>
<p>Arminius died in 1609. By that time he had won an influential follow-
ing, including Oldenbarneveldt and Hugo Grotius, the pensionary of
Rotterdam. In 1610 these “libertines” drew up a Remonstr untie against
the doctrines of predestination, election, and reprobation, and proposed
a national synod of clergymen and laymen to redefine the Reformed faith.
The Precisians formulated a Contra-Remonstrantie reaffirming the Cal-
vinist theology:</p>
<p>God had, after Ada m’s fall, reserved a certain number of human</p>
<p>beings from destruction, and . . . destined them to salvation through
Christ. … In this election God does not consider belief or conver-</p>
<p>sion, but acts simply according to his pleasure. God sent his son
Christ for the salvation of the elect, and of them alone.®^</p>
<p>The Gomarists insisted that such questions could be dealt with only
by clergymen; and they so successfully labeled the Remonstrants as
papists. Pelagians, or Unitarians that a large majority of the
Protestant population rallied to the Precisian side. Maurice of Nassau
moved from a scornful dis- regard of theological disputes to a tentative
association with the orthodox party, as offering him a popular basis for
an attempt to regain national leadership.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>A battle of sermons and pamphlets ensued, of more than warlike
bitter- ness. Violent disturbances broke the peace of the truce.
“Libertine” houses were raided in The Hague, orthodox Calvinist
preachers were driven from Rotterdam. Holland mustered an army to defend
its theology; other prov- inces followed suit; civil war seemed about to
destroy the republic so lately born. On August 4, 1617, Oldenbameveldt
put through the council of Holland a “scherpe resolutie” — ^which
Maurice thought sharp indeed — proclaiming the supremacy of the state in
matters of religion, and directing the cities of the province to arm
themselves for protection against Calvin- ist violence. Passing to
Utrecht, he persuaded its provincial council to raise troops in support
of Holland. On July 25, 1618, Maurice of Nassau, as legal head of the
army, entered Utrecht at the head of an armed force, and compelled its
new regiments to disband. On August 29 the States-Gen- eral of the
United Provinces ordered the arrest of Oldenbameveldt, Gro- tius, and
other Remonstrant leaders. On November 13 a synod of the Reformed Church
met at Dordrecht (Dort), gave the Remonstrant theo- logians a hearing,
condemned them as heretics, and ordered all Remonstrant ministers
dismissed from ecclesiastical or educational posts. The Arminians, like
the Catholics, were placed under a ban and were forbidden to hold public
assemblies or services. Many of them fled to England, where they were
well received by the Established Church and strongly influenced the
Latitudinarian Anglicans.</p>
<p>Oldenbameveldt was tried by a special court, which allowed him no
legal aid. He was charged with having treasonably divided and endangered
the Union, having sought to set up a state within the state. Outside the
court a flurry of pamphlets advertised to the multitude the faults of
his private life. He defended himself with such eloquence and force that
his children raised a Maypole before his prison and confidently
celebrated his coming release. On May 12, 1619, the court pronounced him
guilty, and the sentence of death was carried out the next day. Grotius
was condemned to life imprisonment, but through the ingenuity of his
wife he escaped and lived to write a memorable book.</p>
<p>Despite this triumph of intolerance, religious liberty grew in the
prov- inces. The Catholics were too numerous to be suppressed, and the
doctrinal decrees of the Synod of Dort could not be enforced. In this
same year 1619 the Mennonites freely founded at Rijnsburg their
Quakerlike sect of Collegianten, with whom Spinoza would find safe
refuge. In 1629 Descartes was to praise the intellectual freedom that he
enjoyed in Amsterdam, and by the end of the century Holland was to be
the haven of heretics from many lands.</p>
<p>On August 9, 1621, the war with Spain was resumed. The Archduke Al-
bert having died childless, the southern Netherlands reverted to
Spain.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS 461</p>
<p>Spinola attacked the Dutch border towns. Maurice marched against him,
but years of strife had worn him out, and suddenly, aged fifty-seven, he
was dead (1625). Spinola captured Breda, so opening the road to Amster-
dam and giving a theme to Velazquez.</p>
<p>The Dutch recovered obstinately. Frederick Henry, who succeeded his
brother as stadholder, surprised enemies and friends by his hitherto
hidden talents as statesman and general. Through the diplomacy of
Francis Aers- sens, he secured an annual subsidy of a million livres
from Richelieu; he raised a new army; after long sieges he took ’s
Hertogenbosch, Maastricht, Breda; fortunately, Spinola had been recalled
to Lombardy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Dutch merchants turned money into ships, for every
victory on the sea expanded trade. In 1628 a Dutch flotilla under Piet
Hein captured a Spanish squadron carrying gold from Mexico. Another
Dutch fleet attacked a Spanish force of thirteen vessels on the River
Slaak, de- stroyed it, and took 5,000 prisoners (1631). The most
brilliant of these naval victories was won by Lieutenant Admiral Maarten
Harpertszoon Tromp in the Downs — the English Channel between Dover and
Deal. The Spaniards, resolved to regain control of the Netherlands ports
from the Dutch, had assembled a new armada of seventy-seven ships,
manned by 24,000 men. Sighting it in the Channel, Tromp sent for
reinforcements; on October 21, 1639, with seventy-five vessels, he
sailed in to close quar- ters with the enemy and sank, disabled, or
captured all but seven of the Spanish ships; 15,200 of the Spanish crews
were killed in battle or were drowned. This Battle of the Downs ranks in
Dutch history as the defeat of the Armada does in the history of
England; it ended all claim of Spain to control the seas, cut the
lifeline between Spain and her colonies, and shared with the French
victory over the Spanish army at Rocroi (1643) in closing the era of
Spanish ascendancy in Europe.</p>
<p>Deeply involved in the Thirty Years’ War, Spain decided to yield
every- thing to the Dutch in order to be free to fight the French. At
Munster, January 30, 1648, the Spanish plenipotentiaries signed the
Treaty of West- phalia, ending the “Eighty Years’ War” in the
Netherlands. The United Provinces were declared free of all bond to
Spain; their conquests were recognized; Rhine commerce was to reach the
North Sea through Dutch ports alone; and freedom of trade was conceded
to Dutch merchantmen in the Indies East and West. So triumphantly ended
the longest, bravest, and most cruel struggle for freedom in all
history.</p>
