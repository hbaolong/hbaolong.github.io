<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>James VI and I</p>
<p>1567-1625</p>
<p>I. JAMES VI OF SCOTLAND: I567-1603</p>
<p>J AMES VI was crowned King of Scotland (July 29, 1567) at the age</p>
<p>of thirteen months, while his mother lay captive at Lochleven. He was
eight months old when his presumptive father, Damley, was killed, ten
months old when he saw his mother for the last time; she could never be
anything more to him than a name and an imagination blurred with
contumely and far-off tragedy. He was brought up by self-seeking lords
and by teachers hostile to his mother. He received ample education in
the humanities, too much in theology and too little in morals, and he
be- came the most learned hard drinker in Europe.</p>
<p>Four regents in succession ruled Scotland in his name — Murray,
Lennox, Mar, Morton; all but one died by violence. Rival noble bands
fought for the King’s person as the aegis of power. In 1582 some
Protestant lords, sup - ported by the Kirk, confined him in Ruthven
Castle for fear that he might submit to the influence of his Catholic
relative Esme Stuart. Released, he promised to defend Protestantism,
signed an alliance with Protestant Eng- land, and, aged seventeen,
undertook to be actual king (1583).</p>
<p>He was unique among sovereigns. His manners were rough, his gait un-
gainly, his voice loud, his conversation a cross of coarseness with
pedantry . One not too kindly to him judged that “in languages,
sciences, and affa irs of state he has more learning than any man in
Scotland.”^ But the same observer added, “He is prodigiously conceited”;
perhaps this trait was a life preserver in a sea of troubles, as well as
the warped perspective of one who could never recall when he had not
been king. He must have had some saving intelligence to keep his crown
on his head in Scotland and wear a greater one in England to a natural
death. He was a bit unsteady about sex; he married the Danish Catholic
Princess Anne, but he had little taste for women, and indulged his
friendliness with favorites to the point of giving gossip a lead.</p>
<p>He had to weave his way craftily amid the furious dogmatisms of his
time. The Guises in France, Philip in Spain, the Pope in Rome, pleaded
with him to bring Scotland back to the Catholic Church, but the Scottish
Kirk watched his every word lest he deviate from the Calvinist line.
He</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>burned no bridges behind him. He corresponded politely with Catholic
powers and was inclined to soften the laws against Catholic worship; he
secretly released a captured Jesuit and connived at another’s escape.^
But Catholic plots angered him, England’s victorious Protestantism
impressed him; he cast in his lot with the Kirk.</p>
<p>It was no comfortable bedfellow. By 1583 its ministers formed the
great majority of the Scottish clergy. Poor in income and in secular
learning, they were rich in devotion and courage. They labored to
restore neglected churches, they organized schools, administered
charity, defended the peasants against the lords, and preached long
sermons which their congrega- tions absorbed in place of printed
material. In the kirk sessions, the pro- vincial synods, and the General
Assembly the new clergy now enjoyed a power rivaling that which the
Catholic hierarchy had wielded before them. Claiming divine inspiration
and therefore infallibility in faith and morals, they assumed over
public and private conduct a control much more rigorous than under the
lax guardians of the older creed. In many towns they levied fines on
Scots who failed to attend kirk services. They prescribed public
penitence, sometimes physical penalties, for detected sins.® Alarmed by
the prevalence of fornication and adultery, they com- missioned the
elders to watch with especial severity over sexual deviations, and to
report these to the sessions and the synods of the Kirk. Shocked by the
license of the English stage, they sought to prohibit theatrical per-
formances in Scotland; and failing in this, they forbade their people to
attend them. Like their predecessors, they made heresy a capital crime.
They pursued witches with burning zeal and voted firewood for the
pyres.^ They persuaded the Parliament to decree the death penalty for
any priest who thrice said Mass; this edict, however, was not enforced.
On hearing of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, the Kirk called for a
massacre of Cath- olics in Scotland, but the state neglected to
co-operate.®</p>
<p>Except for the ministerial claim to inspiration and infallibility,
the Kirk was one of the most democratic institutions of its time. The
parish parson was chosen by the elders, subject to the approval of the
congregation, and the laity shared in the sessions, the synods, and the
General Assembly. These democratic tentatives irritated the aristocratic
Parliament and the anointed King. Arguing — perhaps believing — that he
ruled by divine right, James complained that “some fieiy -spirited men
in the ministry got such a guiding of the people . . . that, finding the
gust 〔taste〕 of government sweet, they began to fancy a democratic
form … I was calumniated in their sermons not for any vice in me but
because I was king, which they thought the highest evil.”® The medieval
struggle between Church and state was resumed.</p>
<p>Now it took the form of an attack by the ministers on the bishops.
These,</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>a Catholic legacy to the Kirk, were formally chosen by the ministers,
but were actually nominated, and often forced upon the clergy, by the
Regent or the King, and they handed over a large part of their
ecclesiastical rev- enues to the state. The ministers saw no warrant in
Scripture for episcopacy, and resolved to run it out of Scotland as
incompatible with the popular organization of the Kirk.</p>
<p>Their leader, Andrew Melville, was a fiery Scot equipped by nature to
inherit the mantle of John Knox. After a university education at St. An-
drews, he continued his studies in Paris and then imbibed the Calvinist
gospel from Beze in Geneva. Returning to Scotland (1574), he was at once
appointed, at the age of twenty-nine, principal of Glasgow Univer- sity,
and he ably reorganized its curriculum and discipline. In 1578 he shared
in compiling the Second Book of Discipline, which denounced episcopacy
in the name of ministerial equality. He argued for the definite
separation of spheres between Church and state, and this influenced
their separation in the United States; but he claimed the right of the
ministers to teach the civil magistrates how to exercise their powers
“according to the word.”’^ James, however, wanted to be an absolute
ruler like Henry VIII or Elizabeth; he believed in bishops as necessary
in ecclesiastical ad- ministration, and as convenient intermediaries
between Church and state.</p>
<p>In 1580 the General Assembly of the Kirk “damned” the ofiice of
bishops as a “folly of men’s invention”; all bishops were commanded,
under penalty of excommunication, to cease their functions, and to apply
to the Assembly for admission as simple ministers. The government
rejected the Second Book of Discipline and held that no excommunication
should be valid unless ratified by the state. In 1581 Lennox, then
regent, nominated Robert Montgomerie to be Archbishop of Glasgow. The
Glasgow ministry re- fused to elect him; he insisted on officiating
nevertheless; the General Assembly, led by Melville, excommunicated him
(1582); Montgomerie yielded and withdrew. Melville, accused of sedition,
rejected a civil, de- manded an ecclesiastical, trial; condemned for
contempt of court, he fled to England (1584). James persuaded the
Parliament to declare treasonable any refusal to submit to secular
jurisdiction, any meddling of ministers in affairs of state, any
resistance to the episcopate, any convocations un- licensed by the King.
Many ministers, rather than accept these decrees, followed Melville into
exile. James, savoring his sovereignty, indulged him- self in a reign of
terror: ministers were punished because they prayed for their exiled
brethren; two men were put to death for communicating with them; two
others were executed on a charge of conspiracy.</p>
<p>The clergy and their congregations resisted with Scottish
tenacity.</p>
<p>Pamphlets of undiscovered origin blackened the King, ballads sang the
shame of his tyranny, even women wrote diatribes committing him to
hell.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>His bishops received less and less money, transmitted ever less to
the state; James found himself starved of coin — ^the very sinews of his
will. Year by year he weakened, until the Parliament of 1592, with his
dour consent, voted a charter of liberty to the Kirk, restoring to it
all its powers of</p>
<p>jurisdiction and discipline, and abolishing the episcopate. The
exiles re- turned.</p>
<p>Melville, bolder than ever, called James to his face “God’s silly
vassal,” and gave the theocratic gospel to him in 1596 as firmly as
Gregory VII to Emperor Henry IV five hundred years before (1077): “There
are two kings and two kingdoms in Scotland: there is Christ Jesus and
His King- dom the Kirk, whose subject King James VI is . . . not a king,
nor a head, nor a lord, but a member.”® David Black, minister at
St. Andrews, told his congregation (1596) that all kings were children
of the Devil, Elizabeth was an atheist, and James was Satan himself.®
The English ambassador protested. The Privy Council summoned Black to
trial. He refused to appear, saying that an offense in the pulpit was
subject only to a court of the Kirk, and that, besides, he had received
his message from God. James ordered him tried in absentia. A committee
of ministers came to the King; he yielded nothing; on the contrary, he
demanded that acts of the ecclesi- astical Assembly, as of Parliament,
must be subject to his ratification. The ministers proclaimed a general
fast, and declared ominously that, whatever happened, “they were free of
his Majesty’s blood.”^®</p>
<p>A riotous crowd gathered about the building where James was staying
(December 17, 1596). He fled to Holyrood Palace, and next morning re-
moved with all his court from Edinburgh. He declared to its people, by a
herald, that it was not fit to be a capital, and that he would never
return except to execute judgment on rebels; and he ordered all clergy
and non- residents to leave the city. The rioters, having no one to
kill, dispersed. The merchants bemoaned the loss of court trade; the
citizens wondered whether the dispute was worth economic martyrdom;
James returned in angry triumph (January i, 1597). The General Assembly,
meeting at Perth,</p>
<p>offered the Kirk’s submission; it agreed that no ministers were to be
ap - pointed in the chief cities without the consent of the King and the
con- gregation; that ministers were not to preach about acts of
Parliament or the Privy Council, and that no man vyas to be personally
attacked from the pulpit. The ministers were allow^sd to re-enter the
capital (1597), but the episcopate was restored. A sullen truce settled
down upon the ancient war between Church and state.</p>
<p>Two figures stand out in the Scottish literature of this period: the
King himself and the most famous of his teachers. George Buchanan had an
astonishing career. Born in Stirlingshire in 1 506, he studied in Paris,
served</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>as a soldier in France and Scotland, caught scholastic and political
fire from the lectures of John Major, returned for love and learning to
Paris, came back to Scotland a satirical heretic, was imprisoned by
Cardinal Beaton, escaped to Bordeaux, taught Latin there, wrote poems
and dramas in re- markably good Latin, saw his pupil Montaigne act in
one of these plays, headed a college in Coimbra, was imprisoned by the
Spanish Inquisition for making fun of friars, went back to Scotland, to
France, to Scotland, tu- tored Mary Queen of Scots (1562), was made
moderator of the General Assembly (1567), pronounced the Casket Letters
authentic, was accused of forging part of them,^^ condemned Mary without
mercy in his Detectio Mariae Regime (1571), tutored her son over her
protests, and gave up the ghost in 1582. His Rerum Scoticarum historia
(1579) labored to free his country’s history from “English ties and
Scottish vanity.” His treatise</p>
<p>The King was as proud of his books as of his regalia. In 1616 he pub-
lished, in a huge folio. The Works of the Most High and Mighty Prince
James, which he dedicated to Jesus Christ. He wrote poems, advice to
poets, a translation of the Psalms, a study of the Apocalypse, a
treatise on demons, and, in the annus mirabilis 1 598, two royal octavos
in defense of absolute monarchy. One, the Basilikon Dor on (1598), or
Kingly Gift, was a book of advice to his son Henry on the art and the
duties of sovereignty; it emphasized the ruling of the Kirk as “no small
part of the king’s office.” The other volume. The True Law of Free
Monarchies, expounded ab- solutism with considerable eloquence: kings
were chosen by God, since all important events were dictated by His
Providence; their divine appoint- ment and anointment constituted a
mystery as holy and ineflFable as any sacrament; therefore their rule
had every right to be absolute, and resistance to it was a folly, a
crime, and a sin bound to cause more harm than any tyranny. What to
Elizabeth had been a useful myth became to James a</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>passionate principle, bom of being born of a queen. His son Charles
in- herited the doctrine and paid the penalty.</p>
<p>England, however, did not in 1598 foresee 1649. After James had
pledged himself to Protestantism, the leaders of Elizabeth’s Privy
Council recog - nized him as heir, through Mary, to the English crown.
Four days after Elizabeth’s death James began (April 5, 1603) a festive
progress from Edinburgh to London; he stopped leisurely en route to be
feted by the English nobility; on May 6 he reached a London which was
all decked out to welcome him — crowds genuflecting before him, lords
kissing his hands. After a millennium of useless strife the two nations
(not till 1707 the two parliaments) were united under one king. So
fmitful had been Eliza- beth’s barren womb.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>JAMES I OF ENGLAND: 1603-I4</li>
</ol>
<p>What sort of a man had he become in thirty-seven years? Of middle
stature, weak legs, slightly swollen paunch, padded doublet and breeches
to impede assassins’ knives; brown hair, ruddy cheeks, knobby nose, a
look of suspicion and sadness in the blue eyes, as if the god were
conscious of his clay. A little lazy, resting on Elizabeth’s oars.
Profane in his language, coarse in his amusements; stammering and
absolute, wagging too loosely his burry tongue. Vain and generous,
timorous and deceitful because often endangered and deceived; ready to
take and give offense, to grant and sue for pardon. When John Gib denied
having lost some precious documents, James lost his temper, kicked him;
then, having found the papers, he knelt down before his humiliated aide
and would not rise till Gib had for- given him. Tolerant amid
intolerance, sometimes hard, usually kind and affectionate, suspecting
his son Henry as too popular, loving his son Charles to foolishness;
unblemished in his relations with women, but given to fondling handsome
young men. Superstitious and learned, silly and shrewd, taking demons
and witches seriously but favoring Bacon and Jonson; jealous of scholars
and enamored of books. One of his first acts as King of Eng- land was to
empower Oxford and Cambridge to send representatives to Parliament. When
he saw the Bodleian Library he cried out, “If I were</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>He was so unfriendly to water that he resented having to use it
for</p>
<p>washing. He drank to excess and allowed some court festivities to end
in a general and bisexual intoxication. Extravagance in dress and
entertainment prevailed at his court even beyond Elizabethan precedent.
Masques had been favored by Elizabeth; but now, when Ben Jonson wrote
the lines and Inigo Jones designed the costumes and scenery, and the
roles were played by gorgeous lords and ladies swathed in the revenues
of the kingdom, the fabulous, fantastic art reached its apogee. The
court became gayer than ever, and more corrupt. “I do think,” says a
lady in one of Jonson’s pl ays, “if nobody should love me but my poor
husband, I should e’en hang my - self.”^® Courtiers accepted substantial
“gifts” to use their influence in get - ting charters, patents,
monopolies, or offices for applicants; Baron Montagu paid 20,000 for
appointment as Lord Treasurer;^® one tender soul, we are told on not the
best authority, grew sick and died when he learned how much his friends
had paid to have him made recorder.</p>
<p>James took all such matters in his stride, and did not trouble
himself too laboriously with government. He left administration to a
Privy Council of six Englishmen and six Scots, headed by Robert Cecil,
whom he made Earl of Salisbury in 1605. Cecil had every advantage of
heredity except health. He was crippled with a humped back and made a
lamentable ap- pearance to the world; but he had all his father’s acumen
in the selection and ordering of men, and a silent tenacity and crafty
courtesy that out- witted domestic rivals and foreign courts. When “my
little beagle” died (1612), James fell under the sway of handsome young
Robert Carr, made him Earl of Somerset, and allowed him to supersede, in
policy and ad- ministration, such older and far more accomplished men as
Francis Bacon and Edward Coke.</p>
<p>Coke was the embodiment and the watchdog of the law. He rose to fame
by his tenacious prosecution of Essex in 1600, Raleigh in 1603, the
Gunpowder Plotters in 1605. In i6io he issued a historic opinion:</p>
<p>It appears in our books that in many cases the common law will</p>
<p>control 〔override〕 acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them
to be utterly void. For when an act of Parliament is against common</p>
<p>right and reason … or impossible to be performed, the common law will
control it and adjudge such an act to be void.^®</p>
<p>Parliament may not have relished this, but James made Coke chief
justice of the King’s Bench (1613), and a member of the Privy Council.
From being the King’s man he became the King’s gadfly, condemning
inquisi - tions into private opinions, upholding parliamentary freedom
of speech, and puncturing the royal absolutism with sharp reminders that
kings are</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>the servants of the law. In i6i6 Bacon, his rival, brought charges of
mal- feasance against him. Coke was dismissed, but he was returned to
Parlia- ment; continuing to lead the resistance to the King, he was sent
to the Tower (1621), but was soon released. He died impenitent (1634),
ob- stinately faithful to the letter and rigor of the law, and leaving
behind him four volumes of Institutes that still stand as a pillar and
monument of Eng- lish jurisprudence.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile James had been carrying on with Parliament the debate that
in his son’s reign would eventuate in civil wa r and regicide. He did
not merely assume all the powers that Henry VIII and Elizabeth had
wielded over their cowed or grumbling legislators; he formulated his
claims as divine imperatives. To the Parliament of 1609 he
announced:</p>
<p>The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth. For
kings</p>
<p>are not only God’s lieutenants on earth, and sit upon God’s
throne,</p>
<p>but even by God Himself are called gods. . . . Kings are justly
called</p>
<p>gods, for that they exercise a manner or resemblance of divine power
on earth; for if you will consider the attributes of God, you shall see
how they agree in the person of a king. God hath power to create or
destroy, make or unmake at His pleasure, to give life or send death, to
judge all and be judged nor accountable to none . . . And the like</p>
<p>power have kings; they make and unmake their subjects, they have</p>
<p>power of raising and casting down, of life and death; judges over all
their subjects and in all causes, and yet accountable to none but God
only. They have power to . . . make of their subjects like men at
the</p>
<p>chess — a pawn to take a bishop or a knight — and to cry up or down
any of their subjects, as they do their money</p>
<p>This was quite a step bacltward, for medieval political theory had
regu- larly made the king a delegate of the sovereign people; only the
popes had professed to be the viceroys of God. To put the best
philosophical front on this claim we must assume that the popes, as the
final heads of authority in the Middle Ages, had believed the
individualistic impulses of men to be so powerful that social order
could be maintained only by inculcating in the people a traditional
reverence for ecclesiastical authority, and for the popes as the voice
and vicars of God. The weakening or destruction of papal authority by
the Reformation had left the political powers pri- marily or ultimately
responsible for social order; and they too judged that a purely human
authority would be too challengeable to restrain effectively, • Aubrey
informs us that Coke’s second wife, the w’idow of Sir William Hatton,
“was with child when he married her. Laying his hand on her belly (when
he came to bed), and finding a child to stir, ‘What,’ said he, ‘flesh in
the pot?’ ‘Yea,’ quoth she, ’or else 1</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>»39</p>
<p>or economically, the antisocial proclivities of men. Hence the
doctrine of the divine right of kings grew side by side with the
development of na- tionalism and the reduction of papal power. The
Lutheran princes of Germany, having assumed the spiritual powers of the
old Church in their realms, felt justified in transferring to themselves
the divine aura which almost all rulers before 1789 considered
indispensable to moral authority and social peace. James made the
mistake of expressing this assumption too clearly, and in the most
extreme form.</p>
<p>Parliament might have yielded (with private smiles) some theoretical
acceptance of this royal absolutism if, as in Elizabeth’s heyday, its
members had been great landowners largely indebted to the Tudors for
their title deeds. But the House of Commons now included among its 467
members many representatives of the rising mercantile classes — who
could not stomach a limitless royal power over their money — and many
Puritans who repudiated the claim of the King to rule their religion.
The House defined its rights in bold disregard of James’s divinity. It
declared itself the sole judge in contested elections to its membership.
It demanded freedom of speech and security from arrest during its
sessions; without these, it argued. Parliament would be meaningless. It
proposed to legislate on mat- ters religious, and denied the authority
of the king to decide such issues without parliamentary consent; the
Anglican bishops, however, claimed for their Convocation the right to
rule in ecclesiastical affairs, subject only to the approval of the
king. The Speaker of the Commons informed James that the king could not
institute any law, but could only ratify or reject the laws that
Parliament had passed. “Our privileges and liberties,” de - clared the
Commons (June 1604), “a re our rights and due inheritance, no less than
our very lands and goods . . . They cannot be withheld from us . . . but
with apparent wrong to the whole state of the realm.”*^</p>
<p>So the lines were drawn for that historic struggle between the
“preroga - t ive” of the king and the “privilege” of Parliament — which,
after a hun- dred victories and defeats, would create the democracy of
England.</p>
<p>in. THE GUNPOWDER PLOT: 1 605</p>
<p>Above the economic and political strife, but deeply rooted in it,
the</p>
<p>religious warfare raged. Half the pamphlets that bruised the air were
blasts of Puritans against Anglican bishops and ritual, of Anglicans
against Puri- tan rigor and intransigence, or of both against Catholic
plots to restore England to papal obedience. James underrated the
intensity of these hatreds. He dreamed of an entente demi-cordiale
between Puritans and Anglicans, and for that purpose called their
leaders to a conference at</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>Hampton Court (January 14, 1604). He presided like another
Constantine, and astonished both parties by his theological learning and
his debating skill, but he insisted on “one doctrine and one discipline,
one religion in substance and ceremony,”** and d eclared episcopacy
indispensable. The Bishop of London thought the King divinely inspired,
“the like of whom had not been seen since the time of Christ”;** but the
Puritans complained that James had acted like a partisan rather than a
judge; and nothing came of the conference except the unexpectedly
historic decision to make a new translation of the Bible. The
Convocation of 1604 issued canons requiring conformity of all clergymen
to Anglican worship; those refusing to comply were dismissed, and
several were imprisoned; many resigned; some mi- grated to Holland or
America.</p>
<p>James disgraced himself by having two Unitarians burned for doubting
the divinity of Christ despite the proofs which he offered them (1612),
but he distinguished himself by never thereafter allowing an execution
for religious dissent; these were the last men to die for heresy in
England. Slowly, as secular rule improved, the idea that religious
toleration was com- patible with public morals and national unity was
making headway against the almost universal conviction that social order
required a faith and a Church which were unchallengeable. In 1614
Leonard Busher’s Religiotis Peace argued that religious persecution
intensified dissent, compelled hypocrisy, and injured trade; and he
reminded James that “Jews, Chris - tians, and Turks are tolerated in
Constantinople and yet are peaceable.”*^</p>
<p>For the most part James was a tolerant dogmatist. He offended the
Puri- tans by permitting — encouraging — Sunday sports, provided one had
first attended Anglican services. He was inclined to relax the laws
against Catholics. Over the heads of Robert Cecil and the Council he
suspended the recusancy laws; he allowed priests to enter the country
and say Mass in private homes. He dreamed, in his loose and philosophic
way, of rec- onciling Catholic and Protestant Christendom.<em>® But when
Catholics multi- plied in this sunshine and the Puritans denounced his
lenience, he allowed the Elizabethan anti-Catholic laws to be renewed,
extended, and enforced (1604). To send anyone abroad to a Catholic
college or seminary was made punishable by a fine of one hundred pounds.
All Catholic missionaries were banished, all Catholic teaching
prohibited. Persons neglecting Angli- can services were fined twenty
pounds per month; any default in paying such fines involved forfeiture
of property, real and personal; all the cattle on the delinquent’s
lands, all his furniture and wearing apparel, were to be seized for the
Crown.</em>®</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>I4I</p>
<p>Some half-crazed Catholics thought there was now no remedy but as-
sassination. Robert Catesby had seen his father suffer imprisonment for
recusancy under Elizabeth; he had joined in Essex’ rebellion against the
Queen; it was he who now conceived the Gunpowder Plot to blow up
Westminster Palace while the King, the royal family, the Lords, and the
Commons were assembled there for the opening of Parliament. He brought
into the conspiracy Thomas Winter, Thomas Percy, John Wright, and Guy
Fawkes. The five men swore one another to secrecy and sealed their oaths
by taking the Sacrament from a Jesuit missionary, John Gerard. They
engaged a house adjacent to the palace; sixteen hours a day they labored
to dig a tunnel from one cellar to the other; they succeeded and placed
thirty casks of gunpowder directly under the meeting chamber of the
House of Lords. Repeated postponements of Parliament kept the project in
precarious abeyance; through a year and a half the conspirators had to
feed the fires of their wrath. At times they doubted the morality of an
enterprise in which many innocent persons would perish with those whom
the Catholics thought mercilessly guilty. To reassure them, Catesby
asked Henry Garnett, provincial of the Jesuits in England, whether in
war it was permissible to share in actions that would bring death to
innocent noncombatants; Garnett answered that divines of all faiths
agreed in the affirmative, but warned Catesby that any plot against the
lives of govern- mental officials would only bring greater suffering to
English Catholics. The provincial conveyed his suspicions to the Pope
and the general of the Jesuits; they bade him keep aloof from all
political intrigues and dis- courage all attempts against the state.*’’
To another Jesuit, Oswald Green- way, Catesby in confession revealed the
plot, which now included measures for a general rising of Catholics in
England. Greenway reported the plot to Garnett. The two Jesuits
hesitated between betraying the conspirators to the government and
remaining silent; they chose to keep silent, but to do all in their
power to dissuade the conspirators.</p>
<p>Catesby sought to quiet the qualms of his associates by arranging
that on the morning of the appointed day friendly members of Parliament
should receive urgent messages to call them away from Westminster. A
minor figure in the plot warned his friend Lord Monteagle several days
before the session was to begin. Mounteagle laid the matter before
Cecil, who told the King. Their agents entered the cellars, found Fawkes
there and the explosives in due place. Fawkes was arrested (November 4,
1605); he confessed his intentions to blow up Parliament the next day,
but, despite extreme torture, refused to name his accomplices. These,
however, re- vealed themselves by taking up arms and attempting flight.
They were pursued and gave battle; Catesby, Percy, and Wright were
mortally</p>
<p>wounded, and several subalterns were hunted and secured. When the
prisoners were tried they freely acknowledged the conspiracy, but no</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>threat or torment could induce them to implicate the Jesuit priests.
Fawkes and three others were drawn on hurdles from the Tower to
Parliament House and were there executed (January 27, 1606). England
still cele- brates November 5 as Guy Fawkes Day, with bonfires and
fireworks and the carrying of “guys,” or effigies, through t he
streets.</p>
<p>Gerard and Greenway escaped to the Continent, but Garnett was cap-
tured, and with him another Jesuit, Oldcorne. In the Tower these two
found means of what they supposed to be secret conversation, but spies
reported their words. Separately accused of these conferences, Garnett
denied them, Oldcorne admitted them; Garnett confessed that he had lied.
Breaking down, he conceded that he had had knowledge of the plot; but as
this had come to him from Greenway, and Greenway had received it under
the seal of confession, he had not felt free to reveal it; however, he
had done all in his power to discourage it. He was pronounced guilty,
not of the plot but of concealing it. For six weeks the King delayed
signing the death warrant. Garnett, falsely informed that Greenway was
in the Tower, sent him a letter; it was intercepted; asked if he had
communi- cated with Greenway, he denied it; confronted with the letter,
he argued that equivocation was permitted to a person to save his life.
On May 3, 1606, he was hanged, drawn, and quartered.^®</p>
<p>Parliament felt justified in intensifying the statutes against
Catholics (1606). They were barred from the practice of medicine or law,
and from serving as executors or guardians; they were forbidden to
travel more than five miles from their houses; and a new oath was
demanded of them which not only denied the power of the popes to depose
secular rulers, but branded the assertion of that power as impious,
heretical, and damnable.®® Pope Paul V forbade the taking of this oath;
a majority of English Cath- olics obeyed him; a large minority accepted
it. In 1606 six priests were executed for refusing it and for saying
Mass; between 1607 and 1618 six- teen more were put to death.®® The
prisons held several hundred priests, several thousand Cathohc laymen.
Despite these terrors, Jesuits continued to enter England; there were at
least 68 there in 1615, 284 in 1623.®^ Some Jesuits found their way into
Scotland; one of them, John Ogilvie, was put to death there in 1615,
after having his legs crushed in torture by “the boots,” and being kept
awake for eight consecutive days and nights by the insertion of pins
into his flesh.®® All the sins of the old Church were visited upon her
by the new certainties and powers.</p>

<p>The English ecstasy continued in literature as well as in religion.
To the age of James I belong the better half of Shakespeare’s plays,

<p>Chapman, most of Jonson, Webster, Middleton, Dekker, Marston, some of
Massinger, all of Beaumont and Fletcher; in poetry Donne, in prose Bur-
ton and, noblest of all, the King James version of the Bible: these are
glories enough for any reign. The King had a taste for drama; in one
Christmas season fourteen plays were acted at his court. The Globe
theater was burned to the ground in 1613 by the firing of two cannons in
a production of Henry VIII, but it was soon rebuilt, and by 1631 there
were seventeen theaters in or near London.</p>
<p>George Chapman was five years older than Shakespeare and outlived him
by eighteen, spanning three reigns (1559-1634). He took his time matur-
ing; by 1 598 he had successfully completed Mar lowe’s Hero and Leander,
and had published seven books of The Iliad; but his translation of Homer
was not finished till 1615, and his best plays came between 1607 and
1613. He opened a new field to English drama by taking a theme from
recent French history in his Bussy (TAmbois (1607?) — five acts of
blusterous oratory rarely redeemed with magic of phrase, but rising to
corrosive power in a page where Bussy and his enemy exchange ironic
compliments as indigestible as truth. Chapman never recovered from his
education; his much Greek and more Latin sat stiflingly upon his muse,
and to read his plays is now a labor of lore, hardly of love. Nor do we
thrill as Keats did “on first looking into Chapman’s Homer.” There is a
sturdy vigor in these heptameters that here and there lifts them above
Pope’s generally better</p>
<p>Shall we tarry with Thomas Heywood, Thomas Middleton, Thomas</p>
<p>Dekker, Cyril Tourneur, and John Marston, or beg them to let us off
with a humble salute to their flickering fame? John Fletcher cannot be
so scrimped, for in his heyday (1612-25) England honored him, in the
drama, only next to Shakespeare and Jonson. Son to a Bishop of London,
nephew or cousin to three poets of a sort, he was nursed on verse and
reared with rhyme; and to all this heritage he added the privilege of
collaborating with Shakespeare on Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen,
with Massinger on The Spanish Curate, and, with most success, with
Francis Beaumont.</p>
<p>“Frank” was also to the manner born, being the son of a prominent</p>
<p>judge, and brother to a minor poet who eased by a year the way for
Frank’s</p>

<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>entrance into the world. Failing to graduate from Oxford or the Inner
Temple, Beaumont tried his hand at voluptuous poetry, and joined with
Fletcher in writing plays. The two handsome bachelors shared bed and
board, goods and clothes, mistresses and themes; “they had one wench be
- tween them,” says Aubrey, and “a wonderful consimility of phansey.”®®
For ten years they collaborated in producing such plays as Philaster, or
Love Lies a- Bleeding, The Maid’s Tragedy, The Knight of the Burning</p>
<p>Pestle. The dialogue is vigorous but windy, the plots artfully
tangled but artificially resolved, the thought seldom reaching to
philosophy; neverthe- less, toward the end of the century (Dryden
assures us) these dramas were twice as popular on the stage as
Shakespeare’s.®*</p>
<p>Beaumont died at thirty, in the year of Shakespeare’s death.

<p>The idyl had one performance and disappeared from the stage. What
chance had such a paean to chastity in an age still simmering with the
Elizabethan fire?</p>
<p>The most powerful and disagreeable of the Jacobean dramatists is John
Webster. We know almost nothing of his life, and it is just as well. We
gather his mood from the preface to his best play. The W hite Devil ( 1
6 1 1 ) , where he calls the audience “ignorant asses,” and deposes that
“the breath that comes from the incapable multitude is able to poison .
. . the most sententious 〔profound〕 tragedy.” The story is that of
Vittoria Accoramboni, whose sins and trial (1581- 85) had stirred Italy
in Webster’s childhood. Vittoria feels that her husband’s income does no
justice to her beauty. She accepts the attentions of the moneyed Duke of
Brachiano, and suggests that he dispose of her husband and his own wife.
He attends to the matter at once, with the aid of Vittoria’s pander
brother Flamineo, who provides for these crimes the most cynical
obbligato in all English literature. She is arrested on suspicion, but
defends herself with such audacity and skill as scares a lavsyer out of
his Latin and a cardinal out of his hat. She is kid- naped from justice
by Brachiano; they are pursued; finally pursuers and pursued, the just
and the unjust, are slaughtered in a dramatic holocaust that left
Webster’s blood lust sated for a year. The plot is well managed, the
characters are consistently drawn, the language is often virile or vile,
the crucial scenes are powerful, the poetry rises at times to S
hakespeare’s eloquence. But to a taste made squeamish by civilization
the play is de- formed by the forced and gutter coarseness of Flamineo,
by the hot curses that pour even from pretty mouths (“Oh, could I kill
you forty times a day, and use ’t four years together, ’twere too
little!”),®® by the pervasive obscenity, the word whore on every second
page, the endless double mean- ings that would have made even
Shakespeare blush.</p>
<p>Webster returned to the shambles in The Duchess of Malfi (1613).</p>
<p>Ferdinand, Duke of Calabria, forbids his young widowed sister,
the</p>
<p>Duchess of Amalfi, to marry again, for if she dies mateless he will
inherit her fortune. She mourns her enforced chastity:</p>
<p>The birds that live i’ the field</p>
<p>On the wild benefit of nature, live</p>
<p>Happier than we, for they may choose their mates.</p>
<p>And carol their sweet pleasures to the spring.*®</p>
<p>Excited by lust and prohibition, she lures her steward, Antonio, into
a secret marriage and a precipitate bed. Ferdinand has her killed. In
the</p>
<p>146 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>final act someone is slain almost every minute; doctors are ready
with poisons, ruffians with daggers; no one has the patience to wait for
a legal execution. The worst villain of the piece — ^who kills the
Duchess, steals her property, takes a mistress and then murders her —
^is a cardinal; Webster was no papist. Here, too, are doubles-entendres
of quite urological candor, a resolve to exhaust the vocabulary of
execration, and a wild, indiscriminate condemnation of human life. Only
in the remote corners of this dark canvas do we find nobility, fidelity,
or tenderness. Ferdinand forgets him- self and is soft for a line as he
looks upon his sister, still beautiful in death:</p>
<p>Cover her face! Mine eyes dazzle, she died young . .</p>
<p>But he soon recalls himself to barbarism.</p>
<p>Let us hope to find something sweeter than all this in the man who
could write “Drink to me only with thine eyes.”</p>

<p>He was a posthumous product, being bom in Westminster a month after
his father’s death. He was christened Benjamin Johnson; he dropped the h
to distinguish himself, but the printers continued to use it, over his
dead body, till 1840; it still appears in the plaque on Westminster
Abbey’s walls. The mother, having had a minister for her first husband,
took a bricklayer for her second. The family was poor; Ben had to scrape
for an education; only the kindness of a discerning friend financed his
entry into Westminster School. There he had the luck to come under the
influence of its “under - master,” the historian and antiquarian William
Camden. He took to the</p>
<p>After graduating fr om Westminster, he attended Cambridge, “where,”
says his earliest biographer, “he continued but a few weeks for want of
further maintenance.”®* His stepfather needed him as apprentice brick -
layer, and we picture Ben sweating and fretting for seven years as he
laid bricks and meditated poetry. Then suddenly he was off to the wars,
caught in the draft, or rushing to them as livelier than bricks. He
served in the Netherlands, fought a duel with an enemy soldier, killed
and despoiled him, and came home to tell expanding tales. He married,
begot many children, buried three or more of them, quarreled with his
wife, left her for five</p>

<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>years, rejoined her, and lived with her incompatibly till her death.
Clio herself knows not how he buttered the family’s bread.</p>
<p>The mystery deepens when we learn that he became an actor (1597). But
he was bursting with bright ideas and happy lines, and merely reciting
other men’s thoughts could not long contain him. H e rejoiced when Tom
Nash invited him to collaborate on The hie of Dogs, and doubtless he
con- tributed his share to the “very seditious and slanderous matter”
that the Privy Council found in the play. The Council ordered the
performance stopped, the theater closed, the authors arrested. Nash, an
old hand at such scrapes, lost himself in Yarmouth; Jonson found himself
in jail. As the custom of the prison required him to pay for his food,
his lodging, and his shackles, he borrowed four pounds from Philip
Henslowe, and, re- leased, joined Henslowe’s (and Shakespeare’s)
theatrical company (1597).</p>
<p>A year later he wrote his first important comedy. Every Man in
His</p>
<p>Humour, and saw Shakespeare act in it at the Globe. Perhaps the great
dramatist did not relish the prologue, which proposed, despite current
ex- ample, to follow the classic unities of action, time, and place, and
not To make a child, now swaddled, to proceed</p>
<p>Man, and then shoot up, in one beard and weed,</p>
<p>Past threescore years … You will be pleased to see</p>
<p>One such today as other plays should be.</p>
<p>Where neither chorus wafts you o’er the seas.</p>
<p>Nor creaking throne comes down, the boys to please . . .</p>
<p>But deeds and language such as men do use.</p>
<p>And persons such as comedy should choose</p>
<p>When she would show an image of the times.</p>
<p>And sport with human follies, not with orimes.</p>
<p>So Jonson turned his back upon the aristocratic badinage of
Shakespeare’s early comedies, and upon the miraculous geography and
chronology of the “romantic” drama; he brought the slums of London to
the stage, and concealed his erudition in a remarkable reproduction of
lower-class di- alects and ways. The characters are caricatures rather
than complex phil- osophical creations, but they live; they are as
worthless as in Webster, but they are human; they are mentally unkempt,
but they are not mur- derers.</p>
<p>The Latins had used umor to mean “moisture” or “a fluid”; the Hip
-</p>
<p>pocratic medical tradition had used humor to designate four fluids of
the body — blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile; according to the
pre- dominance of one or another of these in a person, he was said to be
of a sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic, or choleric “humour,” or tempera
ment. Jonson defined his own interpretation of the term:</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>As when some one peculiar quality</p>
<p>Doth so possess a man that it doth draw</p>
<p>All his affects 〔feelings〕, his spirits, and his powers.</p>
<p>In their confluctions, all to run one way —</p>
<p>That may be truly said to be a humour.^®</p>
<p>The word came to life in the hilarious portrayal of Captain Bobadil,
a direct descendant of Plautus’ miles gloriosus, but reeking with his
own peculiar “humour” and unconscious humor — always brave except in
peril, bursting to fight except when challenged, a master of the
sheathed</p>
<p>sword.</p>
<p>The play was well received, and Ben could sow his wild oats less nig-
gardly. He was now bouncy with confidence, proud as a poet, talking to
lords without servility, standing his ground stubbornly, absorbing life
hur- riedly at every chance and pore, relishing forthrightness and rough
humor, seducing women now and then, but finally (he told Drummond)
preferring “the wantonness of a wife to the coyness of a mistress. He
left off acting and lived rashly by his pen. For a time he prospered by
writing masques for the court; the light fantastic lines he wrote fitted
well the scenes that Jones designed. But Ben, hot-tempered, quarreled
widely. In the year of his first success he fell out with Gabriel
Spencer, an actor, dueled with him, killed him, and was jailed for
murder (1598). To make matters worse for himself, he was converted to
Catholicism in prison. Nevertheless he re- ceived a fair trial, and he
was allowed to plead “benefit of clergy” because he read the Latin
psalter “like a clerk”; he was released, but only after having the
letter T stamped with a hot iron on his thumb so that he might be
readily identified as a second offender if he killed again; all the rest
of his life he was a branded felon.</p>
<p>After a year of liberty he was returned to jail for debt. Henslowe
again bailed him out, and in 1600 Jonson wooed solvency by writing Every
Man out of His Humour. He weighted the comedy with classical tags; added
to the dramatis personae three characters who served as a commenting
chorus; rained invectives upon Puritans who had “religion in their
garments, and their hair cut shorter than their eyebrows”; and
brandished his lore at playwrights who were wrecking the Aristotelian
unities. Instead of im- possible romances about incredible lords, he
proposed to show London mercilessly to itself, to</p>
<p>oppose a mirror</p>
<p>As large as is the stage whereon we act.</p>
<p>Where they shall see the time’s deformity</p>
<p>Anatomized in every nerve and sinew</p>
<p>With constant courage, and contempt of fear.^®</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>The play made more enemies than royalties, and it is not recommended
reading today. Dissatisfied with the noisy audience at the Globe, Jonson
wrote his next comedy, Cynthia’s Revels (1601), for a company of boy
actors and a smaller, choicer audience at the Blackfriars theater.
Dekker and Marston felt themselves satirized in the play; in 1602 the
Chamberlain’s company, angered by the competition of the Blackfriars’
boys, produced Dekker’s Satiromastix (i.e., the satirist flogged), which
pilloried Jonson as a puny, pockmarked, conceited pedant, murderer, and
bricklayer. The quarrel ended in an exchange of eulogies, and for a time
fortune smiled. A prospering lawyer took Ben into his home, and the Earl
of Pembroke sent the poet twenty pounds “to buy books. So fortified, he
tried his hand at tragedy. He took as his subject Sejanus, the evil
favorite of Tiberius. He based his narrative carefully upon Tacitus,
Suetonius, Dio Cassius, and Juvenal; he achieved a scholarly
masterpiece, some moving scenes (e.g., V, x) and stately lines; but the
audience resented the long speeches, the tedious moralism of lifeless
characters; the play was soon withdrawn. Jonson printed the text and in
the margin gave his classical sources, with notes in Latin. Lord
Aubigny, impressed, gave the sorrowing author asylum for five years.</p>
<p>He returned to the arena in 1605 with his greatest play. Volpone, or
The Fox attacked with burning satire the money lust that raged in
London. As usual with comedies — from Plautus to The Admirable Crichton
— a clever servant is the brains of the plot. Mosca (Italian for fly)
brings to his miser master, Volpone, who pretends to be seriously ill, a
succession of legacy hunters — ^Voltore (vulture), Corbaccio (crow),
Corvino (raven) — who leave substantial presents in the hope of being
named Volpone’s heir. The “fox” accepts each gift with grasping
reluctance, even to borrowing Corbaccio’s wife for a night. Mosca
finally deceives Volpone into making the servant sole legatee. But
Bonario (good nature) exposes the trick, and the Venetian Senate sends
nearly all the cast to jail. The play at last brought the Globe audience
to Jonson’s feet.</p>
<p>He moved hurriedly from success to adversity. He collaborated with
Marston and Chapman on Eastward Ho! (1605); the government arrested the
authors on the ground that the comedy insulted the Scots; the prisoners
were threatened with circumcision of their noses and ears, but they were
released intact, and such dignitaries as Camden and Selden joined in the
banquet given by the liberated triumvirate. Then, on November 7, 1605,
Ben was summoned to the Privy Council as a Catholic who might know
something about the Gunpowder Plot. Though he had dined with a chief
conspirator, Catesby, a month before, he escaped implication; but on
Jan- uary 9, 1606, he was hailed to court as a delinquent recusant.
Since he was too poor to be profitably fined, the charge was not
pressed. In 1610 he re-</p>

<p>turned to the Anglican fold, and “with such enthusiasm that he drank
all the wine in the cup when he attended” Communion.^^</p>
<p>In that year he staged his most famous play. The Alchemist satirized
not merely alchemy, which was a flagging quest, but half a dozen

that he has found the secret of alchemy:</p>

<p>Sir Epicure is a rare morsel, but the others of the cast are dregs,
and their talk is sticky with scatological filth; it is a pity to see
scholarly Ben so erudite in scum and in the argot of the slums. The
Puritans forgivably at- tacked such plays. Jonson retaliated by
caricaturing them in Bartholomew Fair (1614).</p>
<p>He produced many more comedies, full of life and lees; non ragionam
di lor. At times he rebelled against his own coarse realism, and in The
Sad Shepherd he let his imagination roam quite recklessly.</p>
<p>Her treading would not bend a blade of grass</p>
<p>Or shake the downy blowball from his stalk.</p>

<p>As she had sowed them with her odorous foot.“^®</p>

<p>But he left the play unfinished, and, for the rest, confined his
romanticism to pretty lyrics scattered in his comedies like jewels set
in dross. So, in The Devil Is an Ass (i6i6), suddenly he sings:</p>
<p>Have you seen but a bright lily grow</p>
<p>Before rude hands have touched it?</p>
<p>Ha’ you marked but the fall o’ the snow</p>
<p>Before the soil hath smutched it?</p>
<p>Ha’ you felt the wool of beaver,</p>
<p>Or swan’s down ever?</p>
<p>Or have smelt o’ the bud o’ the briar.</p>
<p>Or the nard in the fire?</p>
<p>Or have tasted the bag of the bee?</p>
<p>O so white! O so soft! O so sweet is she!</p>
<p>Still finer, of course, is the song “To Celia,” which he pilfered
from the Greek of Philostratus and transformed, with perfect scholarship
and skill, into “Drink to me only with thine eyes.”</p>
<p>After Shakespeare’s death Jonson was the acknowledged head of the
poetic guild. He became the uncrowned poet laureate of England — not
officially so named, but most often recognized by the government, and
receiving from it a pension of one hundred marks a year. The many
friends who gathered round him at the Mermaid Tavern saw his rough good
nature behind his bad temper and sharp tongue; they fed on his juicy
speech and let him play the lead almost as presidentially as his
namesake of the next century. Ben was now as corpulent as Samuel would
be, and no hand- somer; he mou rned his “mountain belly” and “rocky
face” pocked with scurvy; he could hardly visit a friend without
breaking a chair. In 1624 he moved his dais to the Devil Tavern in Fleet
Street; there the Apollo Club, which he had founded, met regularly to
feast on victuals, wine, and wit; and Jonson, at one end of the room,
had a raised seat, with a handrail that guided his magnitude into the
throne. Tradition called his followers the Tribe of Ben, and numbered
among them James Shirley, Thomas Carew, and Robert Herrick, who called
him “Saint Ben.’’<sup>’</sup></p>
<p>He needed a saintly and uncongenial patience to bear with the poverty
and sickness of his disintegrating years. He reckoned that all his plays
had brought him less than two hundred pounds. He spent in haste and
starved at leisure; he had none of the financial sense that had made
Shakespeare an expert in realty. Charles I continued his pension, but
when Parliament stinted the royal funds the pension was not always paid.
Charles, however, sent him one hundred pounds in 1629, and the dean and
the chapter of Westminster Abbey voted five pounds for “Mr. Benjamin
Johnson in his sickness and want.”^® His last plays failed, his fame
waned, his friends dis - 152</p>

<p>appeared, his wife and children were dead. By 1629 he lived alone,
bed- ridden with paralysis, with only one old woman to take care of him.
He lingered in pain and penury for eight years more. He was buried in
West- minster Abbey, and John Young carved, upon the stone that faced
the grave, a famous epitaph:</p>

<p>At the Hampton Court Conference a Puritan delegate proposed a new
translation of the Bible. The Bishop of London objected that existing
ver- sions were good enough; King James overruled him and ordere d
“special pains taken for a uniform translation, which should be done by
the best learned in both universities, then reviewed by the bishops,
presented to the Privy Council, lastly ratified by royal authority, to
be read in the whole Church, and no other. Sir Henry Savile and
forty-six other scholars</p>
<p>undertook the task, leaning on earlier translations by Wyclif and
Tyndale, and completed it in seven years (1604- 1 1 ). This “Authorized
Version” be - came official in 161 1 and began its immense influence on
Enghsh hfe, liter- ature, and speech. A thousand pithy phrases passed
from it into the language. The adoration of the Bible, already so strong
in Protestant lands, took on fresh fervor in England, raising the
Puritans, then the Quakers, then the Methodists, to a knowledge and
worship of the text equaled only by Moslem devotion to the Koran. The
influence of the translation on Eng- lish literary style was completely
beneficent: it broke up the long and fanciful involutions of Elizabethan
prose into sentences short and strong and clear and natural; it replaced
foreign terms and constructions with racy Anglo-Saxon words and English
idioms. It made a thousand mistakes in scholarship, but it transformed
the noble Hebrew and the common Greek of the Testaments into the finest
monument of English prose.</p>
<p>Two other works of distinguished prose honored the reign: Sir Walter
Raleigh’s History of the World (of which more later), and Robert Bur -
ton’s Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) * — ^the massive matrix in which the

thought him “very merry and facete,” but later in life he became so
melancholy that</p>
<p>astrology, and priestly ministrations, he passed his gloomy days and
starry nights. He calculated his own horoscope, and predicted therefrom
the day of his death with such accuracy that Oxford lads suspected him
of having hanged himself to prove his prescience.®^</p>
<p>He is very much alive in his book. Setting out to examine and
prescribe for hypochondria, he finds digression more pleasant than his
plan. With eccentric humor Rabelaisian only in its pathless wandering,
he discusses everything as casually as Montaigne, peppering his pages
with Latin and Greek, and genially beckoning his reader on and on to
nowhere. He dis- claims originality; he feels that all authorship is
pilfering: “We can say nothing but what has been sa id; the composition
and method is ours only.”®* He confesses that he knows the world only
through books, and through the news that filters into Oxford:</p>
<p>I hear new news every day, and those ordinary rumors of war,</p>
<p>plagues, fires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors,
comets, spectrums, prodigies, apparitions, of towns taken, cities
besieged in France, Germany, Turkey, Persia, Poland, etc., daily musters
and</p>
<p>preparations, and such like, which these tempestuous times afford,
bat- tles fought, so many men slain . . . shipwrecks, piracies, and sea
fights; peace, leagues, stratagems, and fresh alarms. A vast confusion
of vows, wishes, actions, edicts, petitions, lawsuits, pleas, laws,
proclamations . . . opinions, schisms, heresies . . . weddings,
masquings, mummeries,</p>
<p>entertainments, jubilees . . . burials®* —</p>
<p>and he feels (like Thoreau) that if he reads the news of one day he
may take it for granted the rest of the year, merely changing names and
dates. He doubts that man progresses, yet “I will make an Utopia of mine
own … in which I will freely domineer,” and he describes it in fanciful
detail; actually, however, he prefers browsing at peace in his study or
on the banks of the Thames to going forth to reform mankind. Meanwhile
all the authors in the world bring sweetmeats to his feast. He gets
clogged with quotations, becomes dismal again, and after 1 14 fat pages
he resolves to come to grips with the causes of melancholy, which are
sin, concupiscence, intemper- ance, demons, witches, stars,
constipation, venereal excess . . . and its symp- toms, which include
“wind rumbling in the guts . . . sour belchings . . . troublesome
dreams.”®^ Having completed two hundred digressions, he prescribes cures
for melancholy: prayer, diet, medicine, laxatives, diuretics.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>fresh air, exercise, games, shows, music, merry company, wine, sleep,
blood- letting, baths; and then he digresses again, so that every page
is a disappoint- ment and a delight — ^if time would stop.</p>
<p>Now, in poetry, the sonneteers subside and the “metaphysical poets”
come: Richard Crashaw, Abraham Cowley, John Donne, George Herbert — ^who
phrased with gentle grace the peace and piety of an Anglican parsonage.
Samuel Johnson called them metaphysical only partly because they
inclined to philosophy, theology, and argument, chiefly because they
adopted — from Lyly or Gongora or the Pleiade — a style of linguistic
novelties and conceits, verbal wit and involutions, classical excerpts
and labored obscurities. All of which did not prevent Donne from
becoming the finest poet of the age.</p>
<p>Like Jonson and Chapman, he overspread three reigns. Under Elizabeth
he wrote of love, under James of piety, under Charles of death. Brought
up a Catholic, educated by Jesuits, Oxford, and Cambridge, he knew the
sting of persecution and the brooding of concealment. His brother Henry
was arrested for harboring a proscribed priest, and died in jail.
Sometimes John fed his melancholy on the mystical writings of St. Teresa
and Luis de Granada. But by 1592 his proud young intellect had rejected
the marvels of his faith, and the third decade of his life revolved
around martial ad- ventures, erotic pursuits, and skeptical
philosophy.</p>
<p>For a time he dedicated his muse to candid promiscuity. In Elegy XVII
he celebrated “Love’s sweetest part. Variety” —</p>
<p>How happy were our sires in ancient time.</p>
<p>Who held plurality of love no crime!®®</p>
<p>In Elegy XVIII he swam “the Hellespont between the Sestos and Abydos
of her breasts.” In Elegy XIX, “To His Mistress Going to Bed,” he un
-</p>
<p>dressed her poetically and bade her “licence my roving hands.” He
mixed entomology with love and argued that since a flea, by biting both,
had mingled his blood with hers, they were now married in blood and
might sport in sinless ecstasy.®* Then, surfeited with surfaces, he
found fault un- generously with generous women, forgot their dated
charms, and saw only the tricks they had learned in a heartless world;
he flayed his Julia with a raging litany of execrations, and counseled
his reader to choose a homely mate, since “love built on beauty soon as
beauty dies.”®^ Now, si nging antistrophe to Villon, he drew up a poetic
testament in which each stanza struck a blow at “love.”</p>
<p>He shipped with Essex in 1596, helped raid Cadiz, and shipped with
him again in 1597 to the Azores and Spain. Back in England, he found a

<p>berth as secretary to Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal; but he ran away with the Lord Keeper’s niece, married her (1600),
and set himself to support her with poetry. Children came as easily as
rhymes; often he could not feed or clothe them; his wife’s health broke
down; he wrote a defense of suicide. At last relenting, Egerton sent the
family an allowance (1608), and in 1610 Sir Robert Drury gave them an
apartment in his mansion in Drury Lane. A year later Sir Robert lost his
only daugh- ter, and Donne published anonymously, as an elegy for her,
his first major poem, “An Anatomy of the World.” He enlarged the death
of Elizab eth Drury into the decay of man and the universe:</p>
<p>So did the world from the first hour decay . . .</p>
<p>And new philosophy calls all in doubt.</p>
<p>The element of fire is quite put out;</p>
<p>The sun is lost, and th’ earth, and no man’s wit</p>
<p>Can well direct him where to look for it.</p>
<p>And freely men confess that this world’s spent.</p>
<p>When in the Planets and the Firmament</p>
<p>They seek so many new, then see that this</p>
<p>Is crumbled out again . . .</p>
<p>’Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone.</p>
<p>All just supply, and all relation.®®</p>
<p>He mourned to see “how lame and cripple” this earth is, once the
scene of divine redemption, now, in the new astronomy, a mere “suburb”
of the</p>
<p>With new diseases on ourselves we war.</p>
<p>And with new Physic a worse Engine far.®®</p>
<p>And so he turned to religion. His repeated illnesses, the ominous
death of friend after friend, led him to the fear of God. Though his
reason still questioned theology, he had learned to distrust reason too
as but another faith, and he decided that the old creed should be
accepted without further argument, if only to bring peace of mind and
security of bread. In 1615 he became an Anglican priest; and now he not
only preached sermons in somber and stirring prose, but composed some of
the most moving religious poetry in the English language. In 1616 he was
made chaplain to James I; in 1621 he became dean of S t. Paul’s. He had
never published the erotic lyrics of his youth, but he had allowed
copies to circulate in manuscript; now he “repenteth highly,” Ben Jonson
reported, “and seeketh to destroy all his poems.”*® He wrote, instead,
“Holy Sonnets” and, whis tling in the dark, challenged death:</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>Death, be not proud, though some have called thee</p>
<p>Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;</p>
<p>For those whom thou thinks’t thou dost overthrow</p>
<p>Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me . . .</p>
<p>Our short sleep past, we wake eternally.</p>
<p>And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.®^</p>
<p>In 1623, recovering from a serious illness, he wrote in his diary
some famous lines: “Any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved
in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it
tolls for thee.”®^ On the first Friday in Lent, 1631, he rose from a
sickbed to preach what men were soon to call his own funeral sermon; his
aides had tried to dissuade him, seeing how (said his devoted friend
Izaak Walton) “his sickness had left him but so much flesh as did only
cover his bones.”®* Having delivered his sermon, eloquent in the
confidence of resurrection, and “being full of joy that God had enabled
him to perform this desired duty, he hastened to his house; out of which
he never moved till … he was carried by devout men to his grave.”®® He
died in the arms of his mother, who had borne patiently with his sins
and lovingly with his sermons, March 31, 1631.</p>
<p>It was a full, tense life, running the gamut of lust and love, of
doubt and decay, and ending in the warm comfort of old faith. We of
today, who sleep so readily over Spenser, find ourselves startled on
almost every page by this strangely fanciful realist and modern medieval
soul. His verse is rough, but he wished it so; he rejected the affected
graces of Elizabethan speech, and relished unworn words and arresting
prosody; he liked harsh discords that could be resolved into unwonted
harmonies. There was nothing trite in his verse, once he had graduated
from the stews; and this man, who had polished obscenity like another
Catullus, grew to such delicacy and depth of feeling and thought, such
originality of phrase and sentiment, as no other poet could match, in
that amazing age, but Shake- speare himself.</p>

<p>Love and diplomacy are treacherous bedfellows. In 1615 King James
fell in love, in his kindly ambidextrous way, with handsome, dashing,
rich George Villiers, twenty-three. He made him Earl, then Marquis, then
Duke of Buckingham and, after 1616, allowed him to direct the policies
of the state. Buckingham’s wife. Lady Katherine Manners, outwardly co
nform- ing to the Anglican rite, was at heart a Roman Catholic, and may
have in- clined him to friendship with Spain.</p>
<p>CHAP. Vl)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>James himself was a man of peace, and did not allow theology or
piracy to keep him embroiled with the Continent. Soon after his
accession he ended the long war that England had waged with Spain. When
Frederick, Prince of the Palatinate and husband to James’s beloved
daughter Elizabeth, lost his principality at the outset o f the Thirty
Years’ War, James played with the hope that the Hapsburg King of Spain,
properly appeased, would influence the Hapsburg Emperor, Ferdinand II,
to let Frederick regain his throne. To the disgust of his people, James
proposed to Philip IV the mar- riage of Philip’s sister. The Infanta
Maria, with Prince Charles.</p>
<p>Raleigh came to his bloody end as a sacrifice to this Spanish policy.
He had privately opposed James’s succession, and bitterly opposed
James’s sup - porter Essex. Soon after reaching London James dismissed
him from all governmental posts. With characteristic passion and
rashness, Raleigh al- lowed himself to be implicated in several attempts
to unseat the King.®® He was sent to the Tower, protested his innocence,
and attempted suicide. He was tried, was convicted on dubious evidence,
and was condemned to die, December 13, 1603, with all the tortures of a
traitor. On December 9 he wrote to his wife a letter®® warm with such
tenderness and piety as he had seldom shown to the world. James rejected
the pleas of the Queen and Prince Henry to forgive him, but permitted
the prisoner to live on for fifteen years more, always keeping the death
penalty over his head. Rale igh’s wife was allowed to come and dwell
with him in a little house that he built within the Tower precincts. He
was supplied with books by his friends; he made experiments in
chemistry, composed some excellent poems, and wrote his History of the
World. As published in 1614, it began with a pious preface involved and
verbose, revealing a mind harassed and distraught. The narrative opened
with Nineveh, passed on through Egypt, Judea, Persia, Chaldea, Greece,
and Carthage, and ended with Imperial Rome. Raleigh was not anxious to
reach recent times, for “whosoever, in writing a modern history, shall
follow truth too near the heels, it may haply strike out his teeth.”®^
His style improved as he went on, attained a noble splendor in
describing the battle of Salamis, and came to a climax in the concluding
apostrophe to “eloquent, just, and mighty Death.”®®</p>
<p>But he was not reconciled to defeat. In 1616, having raised £ 1,500,
he bribed the Duke of Buckingham to intercede for him with the King.*®
He promised that, if released, he would sail to South America, find what
he alleged to be the rich gold deposits of Guiana, and bring back royal
spoils for the thirsty treasury. James freed him provisionally, and
agreed to let him and his partners keep four fifths of any treasure he
might capture from “heathen and savage people”; but the canny ruler held
the death sentence</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>the Spanish ambassador, pointed out that there were Spanish
settlements in Guiana and hoped they would not be disturbed. James,
anxious for peace and marriage with Spain, forbade Raleigh, on pain of
immediate execution of his death sentence, to interfere with Christian
communities anywhere, particularly the Spanish.’^® Raleigh consented in
writing to these restric- tions.^‘ Gondomar still protesting, James
vowed that if Raleigh violated his instructions the death penalty would
be enforced.’*</p>
<p>With the aid of his friends Raleigh equipped fourteen ships, and with
these he sailed (March 17, 1617) to the mouth of the Orinoco. A Spanish
settlement, Santo Tomas, barred the way up the river to the supposed —
quite legendary — ^mines. Raleigh’s men (he him self staying on board)
landed, attacked and burned the village, and killed its governor. Then,
discouraged by further Spanish resistance, the depleted force abandoned
the gold quest and returned empty-handed to the ships. Raleigh was dis-
heartened to learn that his son had been slain in the assault. He
reproved his second in command, who thereupon committed suicide. His men
lost confidence in him; vessel after vessel deserted his fleet.
Returning to Eng- land and finding that the King was in a rage against
him, he negotiated for escape to France; he was arrested; he tried again
to escape and got as far as Greenwich; there a French agent betrayed
him. He was captured and sent to the Tower, and the King, pressed by
Gondomar, ordered the death sentence carried out.</p>
<p>Tired at last of life and welcoming the boon of a sudden death,
Raleigh walked to his execution (October 29, 1618) with a calm dignity
that made him the hero of a people that hated Spain. “Let us dispatch,”
he asked the sheriffs. “At this hour mine ague comes upon me; I would
not have mine enemies to think I quaked from fear.” He tested with his
thumb the edge of the ax. “This,” he said, “is a fair sharp medicine to
cure me of all diseases and miseries.”’® His loyal widow claimed the
corpse and had it buried in a church. “The Lords,” she wrote, “have
given me his dead body, though they denied me his life. God hold me in
my wits.”’^</p>
<p>Raleigh’s expedition was one of many that took James’s subjects hope-
fully to America. Peasants hungry for land of their own, adventurers
seek- ing fortunes in trade or spoils, criminals fleeing the cruelty of
the law, Puritans resolved to plant the flag of their faith on virgin
soil — ^these and others bore the risks and the tedium of the sea to
make new Englands everywhere. Virginia was settled in 1606-7, Bermuda in
1609, Newfound- land in 1610. “Separatist” clergymen refusing to accept
the Prayer Book and the ritual of the Anglican Church fled to Holland
with their followers (1608). From Delft (July 1620), Southampton, and
Plymouth (Sep-</p>
<p>tember) these “Pilgrims” took sail across the Atlantic; after three
months of ordeal, they set foot on Plymouth Rock (December 21).</p>
<p>CHAP. VI)</p>
<p>JAMES VI AND I</p>
<p>*59</p>
<p>In Asia the English East India Company, confined to 30,000 and</p>
<p>seventeen ships, tried in vain to capture trading ports and routes
from the Dutch East India Company, sailing sixty ships and sinewed with
J〔, 540,000. But in 1615 the mission of Sir Thomas Roe resulted in the
establishment of trade depots at Ahmadabad, Surat, Agra, and elsewhere
in India; and Fort St. George was built and armed to protect them
(1640). The first steps had been taken toward the British Empire in
India.</p>
<p>Despite all temptations of mercantile interests, parliamentary
prodding, and popular chauvinism, James for sixteen years kept to his
policy of peace. The House of Commons begged him to enter the Thirty
Years’ War on the side of the endangered Protestants of Bohemia and
Germany. It pleaded with him to marry his sole surviving son not to a
Spanish but to a Protestant princess. It condemned James’s relaxation of
the anti -Catholic laws, urged him to order all Catholic children to be
separated from their parents and brought up as Protestants, and warned
him that toleration would lead to the growth of a Catholic Church
frankly pledged to intolerance.’®</p>
<p>In 1621 the divergence of views between Parliament and King almost
re- hearsed the conflict (1642) between the Long Parliament and Charles
I. The Commons denounced the extravagance of the court and the
persisting monopolies in restraint of trade; it fined and banished
monopolists, reject- ing their plea that a nascent industry had to be
protected from competition. When James rebuked it for meddling in
executive business, it issued (De- cember 18) a historic “Great
Protestation,” which again affirmed that “the liberties, franchises,
privileges, and jurisdictions of Parliament are the ancient and
undoubted birthright and inheritance of the subjects of Eng- land,” and
added that “the arduous and urgent affairs concerning the king, state,
and defense of the realm … are proper subjects and matter of council and
debate in Parliament.”’* James angrily tore from the journal of the
Commons the page containing this protestation; he dissolved the
Parliament (February 8, 1622), ordered the imprisonment of four parlia-
mentary leaders, Southampton, Selden, Coke, and Pym, and defiantly pro-
ceeded with Buckingham’s plea for a marital alliance with Spain.</p>
<p>The reckless minister now urged the King to let him take Prince
Charles to Madrid to show him off, to see the Infanta, and to conclude
the match. James consented reluctantly, for he feared that Philip would
send Charles back to England the laughingstock of Europe.</p>
<p>Arrived in Madrid (March 1623), Prince and Duke found the lovely</p>
<p>Infanta unapproachable, and the Spanish populace as furious at the
thought of her marrying a Protestant as the English were at the idea of
Charles bringing home a Catholic. Philip and his minister Olivares gave
the visitors every courtesy; Lope de Vega wrote a play for the welcoming
festivities; Velazquez painted a portrait of Charles; and Buckingham
wooed the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>i6o</p>
<p>Spanish beauties almost to the point of honor. But it was made an in-
dispensable condition of the marriage that English Catholics should
receive religious freedom. Charles at once, James at last, agreed; the
marriage treaty was signed; but when James further required Philip to
promise the use of Spanish arms, if needed, to restore the Palatinate to
Frederick, Philip re- fused to commit himself, and James ordered his son
and his favorite home. We see the human side of a king in his letter to
Charles (June 14, 1623): “I now repent me sore that ever I suffered you
to go away. I care 〔neither〕 for match nor nothing, so I may once have
you in my arms again. God grant it! God grant it! God grant it!”” The
Infanta, in bidding Charles</p>
<p>farewell, made him promise that he would have a care for the
Catholics of England.” The returning Prince was hailed by England as a
hero because he brought no bride. He brought a set of Titians
instead.</p>
<p>And now Buckingham, angry at having made a fool of himself in Spain
(as Olivares had assured him), turned to France for a marital alliance,
and secured for Charles the youngest daughter of Henry IV — that
Henrietta</p>
<p>His ailments crowded upon him in these final years. He had poisoned
his organs with Gargantuan and indiscriminate food and drink; now he
suffered from catarrh, arthritis, gout, stone, jaundice, diarrhea, and
hemor- rhoids; he had himself bled every day until the least royal of
his troubles made this superfluous.’^® He refused medicine, received the
sacraments of the Church of England, and died (March 27, 1625) murmuring
the last consolations of his faith.</p>
<p>Despite his vanity and coarseness, he was a better king than some who
excelled him in vigor, courage, and enterprise. His absolutism was
mainly a theory, tempered with a timidity that often yielded to a
powerful Parlia- ment. His pretensions to theology did not impede a will
to tolerance far more generous than that of his predecessors. His brave
