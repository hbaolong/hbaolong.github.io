<h4 id="chapter-xxxviii-the-political-debacle">CHAPTER XXXVIII The
Political Debacle</h4>
<p>x 7 8 3- 8 9</p>
<p>I. THE DIAMOND NECKLACE: 1 785</p>
<p>I N June, 1783, Axel von Fersen, after gallant fighting for America,
and having earned distinction at Yorktown, returned to France, and found
Marie Antoinette as fascinating as when he had left her three years
before. Even in 1787, when she was thirty- two, Arthur Young thought her
“the most beautiful woman” he had seen at the court that day. 1 She
readily sec- onded the request of Gustavus III that Louis XVI appoint
the handsome Fersen colonel of the Royal Swedish Regiment in the French
army — which would allow him to spend considerable time at Versailles.
Axel confessed to his sister Sophie that he loved the Queen, and he
believed that his love was returned. Certainly she felt a warm affection
for him, and eight years later, after his brave attempt to get her and
the King out of France, they ex- changed tender letters; but her
invitation to Sophie to come and live near him suggests a resolve to
keep her feeling for him within proper bounds. 2 Hardly anyone at the
court except her husband believed her innocent. A song popular among the
populace admitted no doubt of her guilt:</p>
<p>Veux-tu connaitre Would you know</p>
<p>Un cocu, un bdtard, une catin? A cuckold, a bastard, a whore?</p>
<p>Voyez le Roi, la Reine, See the King, the Queen,</p>
<p>Et Monsieur le Dauphin. 3 And Monsieur the Dauphin.</p>
<p>Louis-Philippe de Segur summed up the matte r: “She lost her
reputation but preserved her virtue.” 4</p>
<p>On March 25, 1785, Marie Antoinette gave birth to a second son, who
was named Louis-Charles. The King was so pleased that he gave her the
Palace of St.- Cloud, which he had bought from the Due d’ Orleans for
six million livres. The court condemned the extravagance of his
appreciation, and Paris nicknamed the Queen “Madame Deficit.” 5 She used
her power over her hus - band to influence his appointment of ministers,
ambassadors, and other digni- taries. She tried, and failed, to change
his distaste for the alliance with Aus - tria, and her efforts increased
her unpopularity.</p>
<p>Only against the background of this public hostility to
“L’Autrichienne” can we understand the credence given to the story of
the diamond necklace. This collier was itself incredible: a string of
647 diamonds allegedly weigh- ing 2,800 carats. 6 * Two court jewelers,
Charles Bohmer and Paul Bassenge,</p>
<ul>
<li>At the 1965 valuation of ,200 per carat the diamond necklace would
be worth ,360,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>94 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>had bought diamonds from half the world to make a necklace for Mme.
du Barry, confident that Louis XV would buy it for her. But Louis XV
died, and who now would buy so expensive an adornment? The jewelers
offered it to Marie Antoinette for 1,600,000 livres; she rejected it as
too costly. 7 Cardinal Prince Louis-Rene-£douard de Rohan came to the
fore.</p>
<p>He was a ripe product of one of France’s oldest and richest families;
he had, it was said, an income of 1,200,000 livres per year. Ordained a
priest in 1760, he was appointed coadjutor to his uncle, the Archbishop
of Stras- bourg; in that capacity he officially welcomed Marie
Antoinette when she first entered France (1770). Finding Strasbourg too
narrow a field for his ambitions, Rohan lived mostly in Paris, where he
joined the faction hostile to Austria and the Queen. In 1771 Louis XV
sent him to Vienna as special envoy to ferret out Austrian maneuvers in
the partition of Poland. Maria Theresa was offended by the lavish fetes
that he gave, and by his dissemina- tion of scandalous gossip about the
new Dauphine. Louis XVI recalled him to Paris, but powerful relatives
induced the King to make him grand almoner — head disburser of the royal
alms (1777). A year later the gay and hand- some priest was raised to
the cardinalate, and in 1779 he became archbishop of Strasbourg. There
he met Cagliostro, and was charmed into believing the impostor’s magic
claims. Having risen so high so soon, it seemed to Rohan that he might
aspire to be chief minister to Louis XVI, if only he could atone for his
years of opposition to the Queen.</p>
<p>Among his amusements in Paris was the attractive and ingenious Mme.
de La Motte-Valois. Jeanne de St.-Remy de Valois claimed descent from
Henry II of France by a mistress. Her family lost its property, and
Jeanne was reduced to begging in the streets. In 1775 the government
confirmed her royal lineage, and gave her a pension of eight hundred
francs. In 1780 she married Antoine de La Motte, an army officer with a
penchant for in- trigue. He had deceived her about his income; their
marriage, as she put it, was a union of drought with famine. 8 He
appropriated the title of count, which made Jeanne the Comtesse de La
Motte. As such she fluttered around Paris and Versailles, making
conquests by what she called her “air of health</p>
<p>Mme. de La Motte now ventured upon a bolder plan which, if
successful, would put an end to her poverty. She forged a letter from
the Queen au- thorizing Rohan to buy the necklace in her name. The
Cardinal presented this letter to Bohmer, who surrendered the gems to
him (January 24, 1785) on his written promise to pay 1,600,000 francs in
installments. Rohan took</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>943</p>
<p>he brilliants to the Countess, and at her request he turned them over
to an alleged representative of the Queen. Their further history is
uncertain; ap- parently they were taken by the “Comte” de La Motte to
England and sold piece by piece. 12</p>
<p>Bohmer sent a bill for the necklace to the Queen, who replied that
she had never ordered it and had never written the letter that bore her
name. When the date arrived for payment of the first installment (July
30, 1785), and Rohan offered only thirty thousand of the 400,000 francs
then due, Bohmer laid the matter before the Baron de Breteuil, minister
of the King’s Household. Breteuil informed the King. Louis summoned the
Cardinal and invited him to explain his actions. Rohan showed him some
supposed letters from the Queen. The King saw at once t hat they were
forgeries. “This,” he said, “is not in the Queen’s handwriting, and the
signature is not even in proper form.” 13 He suspected that Rohan and
others of the faction hostile to his wife had plotted to discredit her.
He ordered the Cardinal to the Bastille (August 15), and bade the police
find Mme. de La Motte. She had fled to a succession of hiding places,
but she was apprehended, and she too was sent to the Bastille. Also
arrested were “Baronne” d’Oliva, Retaux de Villette, and Cagliostro, who
was wrongly suspected of having planned the intrigue; actually he had
done his best to discourage it. 14</p>
<p>Believing that an open trial was necessary to convince the public of
the Queen’s innocence, Louis submitted the case to his enemies, the Par
is Parle- ment. The trial was the cause celebre of the century in
France, as that of Warren Hastings became in England three years later.
The judgment of the Parlement was pronounced on May 31, 1786. Cardinal
Rohan was declared innocent, as more deceived than deceiving, but the
King deprived him of his state offices and exiled him to the Abbey of La
Chaise-Dieu. Two accom- plices received sentences of imprisonment;
Cagliostro was freed. Mme. de La Motte was publicly stripped and whipped
in the Cour de Mai before the Palais de Justice; she was branded with a
V (for voleuse, thief), and was condemned for life to the notorious
Salpetriere women’s prison. After a year in this maddening confinement
she escaped, joined her husband in London, wrote an autobiography
explaining everything, and died in 1 79 1.</p>
<p>The nobility and the Paris populace rejoiced over the acquittal of
the Cardinal, and blamed the Queen for bringing the matter to a public
trial; the general feeling was that her known appetite for jewelry had
excused the Cardinal for believing the forged letters. Gossip went so
far as to accuse her of being Rohan’s mistress, 15 though she had not
seen him in the ten years be - fore his arrest. Once more she had
preserved her virtue and suffered damage to her reputation. “The Queen’s
death,” said Napoleon, “must be dated from the Diamond Necklace Trial.”

<li>CALONNE: 1783-87</li>
</ol>
<p>On November 10, 1783, the King appointed Charles- Alexandre de</p>
<p>Calonne controller general of finance. Calonne had served
successfully as</p>
<p>944</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>intendant at Metz and Lille, and had earned repute for engaging
manners, buoyant spirits, and monetary skill — though he himself, like
the government that he was called to rescue, was hopelessly in debt. 17
He found only 360,000 francs in the treasury, against a floating debt of
646,000,000, increasing by fifty million francs a year. Like Necker he
decided against additional taxa- tion, fearing that this would arouse
revolt and depress the economy; instead he negotiated a lottery, which
brought in a hundred million livres. He ap- pealed to the clergy, and
won from it a don gratuit of eighteen million livres on his promise to
suppress Beaumarchais’ edition of Voltaire. He reminted the gold coins,
making a profit of fifty million for the treasury. He borrowed 1
25,000,000 from the bankers. Hoping to stimulate business, he allotted
great sums for city sanitation and the improvement of roads, canals, and
harbors; Le Havre, Dunkirk, Dieppe, and La Rochelle benefited; the great
docks at Cherbourg began. On the theory that a government must always
put up a prosperous front, he allocated funds readily to courtiers, and
asked no questions about the expenses of the King’s brothers and the
Queen. The King himself, despite good intentions, allowed the outlay for
his household to rise from 4,600,000 livres in 1 775 to 6,200,000 in 1
787. 18</p>
<p>The more Calonne spent, the more he borrowed; the more he borrowed,
the more interest had to be paid on the debt. In August, 1786, he
confessed to the bewildered King that all expedients had been exhausted,
that the na- tional debt and the annual deficit were greater than ever,
and that only the extension of taxation in the nobility and the clergy
could save the govern- ment from financial disaster. Knowing that the
Paris Parlement, now in un- disguised alliance with the nobility of the
sword, would resist this sugges- tion, he proposed that a group of
distinguished men, to be chosen by him from all three classes throughout
France, be summoned to Versailles to con- sult for the financial
salvation of the state. The King agreed.</p>
<p>The Assembly of Notables convened on February 22, 1787: forty-six
nobles, eleven ecclesiastics, twelve members of the Royal Council,
thirty- eight magistrates, twelve deputies from the pays d’etat (regions
enjoying spe- cial privileges), and twenty-five municipal officials; 144
in all. Calonne ad- dressed them with courageous candor about abuses
which, however deeply rooted in time and prejudice, must be abolished
because “they bear heavily upon the most productive and laborious
class.” He condemned the general inequality of subsidies, and “the
enormous disproportion in the contributions of different provinces and
subjects of one same sovereign.” 19 He expounded proposals more radical
than Turgot’s, and presented the m as having been approved by the King.
Had they been adopted they might have averted the Revolution. Some of
them, carried over from Turgot, were accepted by the Notables: a
reduction in the salt tax, the removal of tolls on internal com- merce,
the restoration of free trade in grains, the establishment of provincial
assemblies, and an end to the corvee. But his request for a new and
universal tax on land was rejected. The noble and ecclesiastical members
argued that this subvention territoriale would require a survey of all
land, and a census of all landowners, in France; this would take a year,
and could have no effect on the current crisis.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>945</p>
<p>Calonne appealed to the people by publishing his speeches; neither
the nobles nor the clergy relished this resort to public opinion. The
Assembly retaliated by demanding from Calonne a full account of revenues
and ex- penditures during his ministry. He refused to comply, knowing
that a revela- tion of his methods and outlays would ruin him. The
Assembly insisted that economy in expenditures was more needed than a
revision of the tax struc- ture; moreover, it questioned its authority
to establish a new system of taxa- tion; such authority belonged only to
a States-General (fitats Generaux — i.e., a national conference of
deputies chosen by the three etats, or classes). No such meeting had
been called since 1614.</p>
<p>Lafayette, one of the Notables, appro ved most of Calonne’s
proposals, but distrusted the man. He accused Calonne of having sold
some of the royal lands without the King’s knowledge; Calonne challenged
him to prove the charge; Lafayette proved it. 20 Louis XVI had resented
Calonne’s appeal to the public over the heads of the government; he
realized, from a succession of disclosures, that Calonne had deceived
him about the condition of the treasury, and he saw that he could get no
co-operation from the Notables as long as Calonne was controller. When
Calonne asked for the dismissal of his critic the Baron de Breteuil, who
was a personal friend of Marie An- toinette, she advised the King to
dismiss Calonne instead. Wearied with the turmoil, he took her advice
(April 8, 1787). Calonne, learning that the Parle- ment of Paris was
planning to investigate his administration and his private affairs,
decamped to England. On April 23 Louis sought to appease the Notables by
promising governmental economies, and publicity of state finances. On
May 1, again on the advice of the Queen, he appointed one of the
Notables to be chief of the Council of Finance.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>LOMENIE DE BRIENNE: 1 787-88</li>
</ol>
<p>He was archbishop of Toulouse, but so notoriously a freethinker that
the philosophies hailed his advent to power. When, six years before, he
had been recommended to succeed Christophe de Beaumont in the
metropolitan see, Louis XVI had protested, “We must at least have an
archbishop of Paris who believes in God.” 21 One of hi s most satisfying
coups as minister of finance was to have himself transferred to the
archbishopric of Sens, which was much richer than that of Toulouse. He
persuaded the Notables to ap- prove his plan for raising eighty million
francs by a loan, but when he asked consent to the new land tax they
again pleaded lack of authority. Seeing that the Notables would do no
more, Louis politely dismissed them (May 25, 17 * 7 )-</p>
<p>Brienne attempted economies by asking cuts in the expenditures of
each department; the departmental heads resisted; the King did not
sustain his minister. Louis reduced his household expenses by a million
francs, and the Queen accepted a similar reduction (August 1 1 ).
Brienne had the courage to refuse monetary demands by the court, by the
friends of the Queen, by a brother of the King. It is to his credit that
he carried through the reluctant</p>
<p>94*5 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>Parlement (January, 1788), against the resistance of most of his
fellow prel- ates, the royal edict extending civil rights to
Protestants.</p>
<p>He was unfortunate in having come to power at a time when crop fail-
ures and the competition of British imports had spread an economic
reces- sion that lasted till the Revolution. In August, 1787, hungry
rioters in Paris shouted revolutionary slogans and burned some ministers
in effigy. “The feeling of everybody,” noted Arthur Young on October 1
3, “seems to be that the Archbishop will not be able to exonerate the
state from the burden of its present situation;… that something
extraordinary will happen; and a bankruptcy is an idea not at all
uncommon.” 22 And on the seventeenth: “One opinion pervaded the whole
company, that they are on the eve of some great revolution in the
government;… a great ferment in all ranks of men, who are eager for some
change;… and a strong leaven of liberty, increasing every hour since the
American Revolution.” 23</p>
<p>The reforms which Calonne and Brienne had advocated, and which the
King had accepted, had yet to be registered and recognized as law by the
parlements. The Paris Parlement agreed to freeing the grain trade and
com- muting the corvee into a monetary payment, but it refused to
sanction a stamp tax. On July 19, 1787, it sent to Loui s XVI a
declaration that “the Nation, represented by the States-General, alone
has the right of granting to the King the resources which might prove
indispensable.” 24 The Paris public approved this pronouncement,
forgetting that the States-General, as thus far known in French history,
was a feudal institution heavily weighted in favor of the privileged
classes. Not forgetting this, the nobility of the sword approved the
declaration, and henceforth allied itself with the parle- ments and the
noblesse de robe in that revolte nobiliaire which prepared the
Revolution. Louis hesitated to call the States-General, lest it should
end the absolutism of the Bourbon monarchy by asserting legislative
powers.</p>
<p>In August, 1787, he presented to the Parlement an edict for a tax on
all land in all classes. The Parlement refused to register it. Louis
summoned the members to a lit de justice at Versailles, and ordered the
registration; the members, returning to Paris, declared the registration
void, and again de- manded a States-General. The King banished them to
Troyes (August 14). The provincial parlements rose in protest; riots
broke out in Paris; Brienne and the King yielded, and the Parlement was
recalled (September 24) amid popular rejoicing.</p>
<p>The conflict was renewed when the Parlement refused to sanction</p>
<p>Brienne’s proposal to raise a loan of 120,000,000 livres. The King
called a “royal session” of the Parlement (November 1 1, 1 787), at
which his minis ters presented arguments for registering the measure.
The Parlement still refused, and the Due d’Orleans cried out, “Sire, it
is illegal!” Louis, in an unusually</p>
<p>reckless burst of temper, answered, “That makes no difference! It is
legal because I wish it”— thus plainly asserting absolutism. He ordered
the edict registered; it was done; but as soon as he had left the hall
the Parlement re- voked the registration. Informed of this, Louis exiled
the Due d’Orleans to Villers-Cotterets, and sent two of the magistrates
to the Bastille (November</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl)</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>947</p>
<p>20). Protesting these and other arrests without trial, the Parlement
sent to the King (March n, 1788) “remonstrances” containing words that
pleased nobles and commoners alike: “Arbitrary acts violate irremovable
rights…. Kings rule either by conquest or by law…. The nation asks from
his Majesty the greatest good that a king can give to his subjects —
liberty.” 25</p>
<p>The ministry thought to pacify the Parlement by yielding to its
demand for publication of the government’s revenues and expenditures.
This made matters worse by revealing a deficit of 160,000,000 livres.
The bankers re- fused to lend more to the state unless the Parlement
sanctioned the loan; the Parlement vowed it would not. On May 3, 1788,
it issued a “Declaration of Rights” which reminded Louis XVI and his
ministers that France was “a monarchy governed by the king, following
the laws,” and that Parlement must not surrender its ancient right to
register royal edicts before these could become laws. It again called
for a States-General. The ministers ordered the arrest of two Parlement
leaders, d’Epremesnil and Goislard (May 4) ; this was done amid wild
confusion in the hall and angry protests in the street. On May 8 Brienne
announced the intention of the government to establish new courts,
headed by a Cour Pleniere which alone would henceforth have the power of
registering royal edicts; the parlements were to be restricted to purely
judicial functions, and the whole structure of French law was to be
reformed. Meanwhile the Paris Parlement was “put on vacation”— in effect
suspended from operation.</p>
<p>It appealed to the nobility, the clergy, and the provincial
parlements. All came to its support. Dukes and peers sent to the King
protests against abro- gating the traditional rights of the Parlement.
An assembly of the clergy (June 1 5 ) condemned the new Plenary Court,
reduced its “gratuitous gift” from a past average of twelve million
livres to 1,800,000, and refused any further aid until the Parlement
should be restored. 26 One after another the provincial parlements rose
against the King. The Parlement of Pau (capital of Bearn) declared it
would register no edicts rejected by the Parlement of Paris; and when
force was threatened against the magistrates the people took up arms to
protect them. The Parlement of Rouen (capital of Normandy) denounced the
ministers of the King as traitors, and outlawed all persons who should
use the new courts. The Parlement of Rennes (capital of Brit- tany)
issued similar decrees; when the government sent soldiers to dismiss it
these were faced by the armed retainers of the local nobility. 27 At
Grenoble (capital of Dauphine), when the military commander proclaimed a
royal edict dissolving the local parlement , the populace of the town,
reinforced by peasants summoned by the tocsin, pelted the reluctant
troops with tiles from the roofs, and compelled the commander, on pain
of being hanged from his chandelier, to withdraw the edict of the King
(June 7, 1787, the “Journee des Tuiles,” or Day of Tiles). The
magistrates, however, obeyed a royal order to go into exile.</p>
<p>The Grenoble community made history by its reaction. Nobles, clergy,
and commonalty resolved to re-establish the old Estates of Dauphine for
a meeting on July 21. Since the Third Estate had led the victory on the
“Day</p>
<p>948</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>of Tiles,” it was accorded representation equal to that of the two
other</p>
<p>Overcome by the almost nationwide revolt against the royal authority,
the King surrendered, and decided to summon a States-General. But, as
174 years had passed since the last meeting of this body, and the growth
of the Third Estate made it impossible to use the old forms of
procedure, Louis XVI issued to the people (July 5, 1788) an
extraordinary appeal as an order of the Royal Council:</p>
<p>His Majesty will endeavor to approximate earlier practices; but when
these cannot be determined he wishes to offset the deficiency by
ascertaining the will of his subjects…. Accordingly the King has decided
to command that all possible researches concerning the aforementioned
matters be made in all the depositories of each and every province; that
the results of such investiga- tions be transmitted to the provincial
estates and assemblies,… which in turn shall apprise his Majesty of
their wishes…. His Majesty invites all scholars and educated persons in
his kingdom… to direct to the Keeper of the Seals all information and
memoirs connected with matters contained in the present decree. 28</p>
<p>On August 8 Louis summoned the three classes of France to send
deputies to a States-General which was to meet at Versailles on May 1,
1789. On the same day he suspended the Cour Pleniere, which soon faded
from history. On August 16 the government in effect acknowledged its
bankruptcy by announcing that till December 31, 1789, the obligations of
the state would be paid not all in currency but partly in paper, which
all citizens should ac- cept as legal payment. On August 25 Brienne
resigned, loaded with favor and wealth, while the Paris public burned
him in effigy. He retired to his rich see at Sens, and there, in 1 794,
he killed himself.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>NECKER again: 1 788-89</li>
</ol>
<p>Reluctantly the King asked Necker to return to the government
(August</p>
<p>25). Now he gave him the title of secretary of state and a seat in
the Royal Council. Everyone, from the Queen and the clergy to the
bankers and the populace, applauded the appointment. A multitude
gathered in the court- yard of the Versailles Palace to welcome him; he
came out and told them,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>949</p>
<p>“Yes, my children, I remain; be comforted.” Some fell o n their knees
and kissed his hands. 28 He wept, in the manner of the time.</p>
<p>Disorder in the administration, in the streets, in the official and
the public mind had come so close to political disintegration that the
best that Necker could do was to maintain stability until the
States-General convened. As a gesture to restore confidence, he put two
million francs of his own into the treasury, and pledged his personal
fortune as partial guarantee of the state’s engagements. 30 He revoked
the order of August 16 requiring bondholders to accept paper instead of
money; government bonds rose thirty per cent on the market. The bankers
advanced the treasury sufficient funds to tide over the crisis for a
year.</p>
<p>On Necker’s advice the King again recalled the Parlement
(September</p>
<p>23). Intoxicated with its triumph, it made the mistake of declaring
that the coming States-General should operate as in 1614 — sitting as
separate classes and voting in class units, which would automatically
reduce the Third Es- tate to political impotence. The general public,
which had credited the Parlement’s claim to be defending liberty against
tyranny, perceived that the liberty intended was that of the two
privileged classes to overrule the king. The Parlement, by so ranging
itself on the side of the feudal regime, forfeited the support of the
powerful middle class, and henceforth ceased to be a factor in shaping
events. The revolte nobiliaire had shown its limits and run its course;
now it gave place to the bourgeois revolution.</p>
<p>Necker’s task was made harder by the drought of 1788, which was ended
by hailstorms that ruined the stunted crops. The winter of 1788-89 was
one of the bitterest in the history of France; at Paris the thermometer
fell to 18 degrees below zero Fahrenheit; the Seine froze solid from
Paris to Le Havre. Bread rose in price from nine sous in August, 1788,
to fourteen in February,</p>
<ol start="1789" type="1">
<li>The upper classes did their best to relieve the suffering; some
nobles, like the Due d’Orleans, spent hundreds of thousands of livres
feeding and warming the poor; the Archbishop gave 400,000 livres; one
monastery fed twelve hundred persons daily for six weeks. 31 Necker
forbade the export of grain, and imported seve nty million livres’
worth; famine was averted. He left to his successors or to the
States-General the task of repaying the loans that he raised.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile he persuaded the King, over the opposite advice of powerful
nobles, to decree (December 27, 1788) that in the coming States-General
the deputies of the Third Estate should equal in number those of the
other states combined. On June 24, 1789, he sent out to all districts an
invitation to vote for representatives. In the Third Estate every
Frenchman above the age of twenty-four who paid any tax was entitled —
and even commanded — to vote; so were all professional men, businessmen,
guildsmen; in effect all the commonalty except paupers and the poorest
laborers had the vote. 32 The successful candidates met as an electoral
committee which chose a deputy for the district. In the First Estate
every priest or curate, every monastery or convent, voted for a
representative in the electoral assembly of the district; archbishops,
bishops, and abbots were members of that assembly ex officio;</p>
<p>950</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>his assembly chose an ecclesiastical deputy to the States-General. In
the Second Estate every nobleman above the age of twenty-four was
automati- cally a member of the electoral assembly which chose a deputy
to represent the nobility of his district. In Paris only those who paid
a poll tax of six or more livres had the vote; there most of the
proletariat was left out. 33 Each electoral assembly in each class was
invited by the government to draw up a cahier des plaintes et doleances
— a statement of complaints and grievances — for the guidance of its
deputy. The district cahiers were sum- marized for each class in
provincial cahiers, and these, in whole or in synop- sis, were presented
to the King. The cahiers of all classes united in condemn- ing
absolutism, and in demanding a constitutional monarchy in which the
powers of the king and his ministers would be limited by law, and by a
na- tionally elected assembly meeting periodically and alone authorized
to vote new taxes and to sanction new laws. Nearly all deputies were
instructed to vote no funds for the government until such a constitution
had been secured. All classes denounced the financial incompetence of
the government, the evils associated with the indirect taxes, and the
excesses of royal power, as in lettres de cachet. All demanded trial by
jury, privacy of the mails, and reform of the law. All pleaded for
liberty, but in their own fashion: the nobles for the restoration of
their pre-Richelieu powers; the clergy and the bourgeoisie for freedom
from all state interference; the peasantry for free- dom from oppressive
taxes and feudal dues. All accepted in principle the equal taxation of
all property. All expressed loyalty to the King, but none mentioned his
“divine right” to rule ; 34 that, by common consent, was dead.</p>
<p>The cahiers of the nobility stipulated that in the States-General
each of the classes should meet separately and vote as a united class.
The cahiers of the clergy rejected toleration, and asked that the civil
rights recently granted to Protestants be revoked. Some cahiers called
for a greater portion of the tithe to be left to the parish, and for
access of all priests to positions in the hierarchy. Nearly all the
ecclesiastical cahiers deplored the immorality of the age in art,
literature, and the theater; they ascribed this deterioration to
excessive freedom of the press, and called for exclusive control of
education by the Catholic clergy.</p>
<p>The cahiers of the Third Estate voiced chiefly the views of the
middle class and the peasant proprietors. They pleaded for the abolition
of feudal rights and transport tolls. They demanded career open to
talent for all classes to all posts. They condemned the wealth of the
Church and the costly idle- ness of monks. One cahier suggested that to
meet the deficit the King should sell the lands and rents of the clergy;
another proposed the confiscation of all monastic property. 33 Many
complained of the devastation of farms by the animals and hunts of the
nobility. They asked for universal free edu- cation, for the reform of
hospitals and prisons, for the complete extinction of serfdom and the
trade in slaves. A typical cahier of the peasants asserted: “We are the
principal prop of the throne, the true support of the armies…. We are
the source of riches for others, and we ourselves remain in poverty.”
36</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII ) THE POLITICAL DEBACLE 95 1</p>
<p>All in all, this election of the States-General was a proud and
generous moment in the history of France. Almost, for a while, Bourbon
France be- came a democracy, with probably a larger proportion of the
people voting than go to the polls in an American election today. It was
a fair election, not as disorderly as might have been expected in so
novel an operation; it was apparently freer from corruption than most of
the elections held in the later democracies of Europe. 37 Never before,
so far as we know, had a gov- ernment issued so broad an invitation to
its people to instruct it in modes of procedure, and to communicate to
it their complaints and desires. Taken altogether, these cahiers gave
the government a more complete view of con- ditions in France than it
had ever before possessed. Now, if ever, France had the materials for
statesmanship; now she had freely chosen her best men, from every class,
to meet with a King who had already made brave overtures to change. All
France was filled with hope as these men, from every part of the
country, made their way to Paris and Versailles.</p>
<p>V. ENTER MIRABEAU</p>
<p>One of them was a noble elected by the commonalty of both Aix-en-
Provence and Marseilles. Distinguished by this anomalous and double
dignity, Honore-Gabriel- Victor Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau, ugly and
fascinating, became a dominant figure in the Revolution from his arrival
in Paris (April,</p>
<ol start="1789" type="1">
<li>till his premature death (1791).</li>
</ol>
<p>We have celebrated his father — Victor Riqueti, Marquis de Mirabeau —
as physiocrat and “Friend of Man,” i.e., of everybody except his wife
and chil - dren. Vauvenargues described this “Ami de l’homme” as “of an
ardent, mel - ancholy temper, prouder and more restless… than the sea,
with a sov- ereign insatiability for pleasure, knowledge, and glory.” 38
The Marquis admitted all this, and added that “immorality was for him a
second nature.” At twenty-eight he resolved to discover if one woman
could be enough; he asked for the hand of Marie de Vessan, whom he had
never seen, but who was heiress apparent to a sizable fortune. After
marrying her he found that she was a slovenly and incompetent termagant;
but she gave him in eleven years eleven children, of whom five survived
infancy. In 1760 the Marquis was imprisoned in the Chateau de Vincennes
for seditious writings, but was released after a week. In 1762 his wife
left him and returned to her mother. Honore-Gabriel, the eldest son,
grew up amid this domestic drama. One of his grandmothers died insane,
one of his sisters and one of his brothers were subject to occasional
insanity; it is a marvel that Gabriel himself, buf- feting one calamity
after another, did not go mad. He had two teeth at birth, as a warning
to the world. At three he suffered an attack of smallpox, which left his
face scarred and pitted like a battlefield. He was an exuberant, quar-
relsome, and willful boy; his father, who was exuberant, quarrelsome,
and willful, beat him frequently, generating filial hate. The Marquis
was glad to get rid of him by sending him, aged fifteen (1764), to a
military academy in</p>
<p>95 *</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>Paris. There Gabriel acquired mathematics, German, and English, and
read eagerly, being consumed with a passion for achievement. He read
Voltaire and lost religion; he read Rousseau and learned to feel for the
commonalty. In the army he stole the mistress of his commanding officer,
fought a duel, took part in the French invasion of Corsica, and won such
commendation for courage that his father momentarily loved him.</p>
<p>At twenty-three he married, frankly for money, fimilie de Marignac,
who expected to inherit 500,000 francs. She bore a son to Gabriel, and
took a lover; he discovered her infidelity, concealed his own, and
forgave her. He quarreled with a M. de Villeneuve, broke an umbrella
over his back, and was accused of intent to kill. To have him escape
arrest his father secured a lettre de cachet by which Gabriel was
forcibly confined in the Chateau d’lf, on an island off Marseilles. He
asked his wife to join him; she refused; they exchanged letters of
rising wrath, until he bad e her, “Farewell forever” (December 14,
1774). Meanwhile he kept warm by sleeping occasionally with the wife of
the chateau’s commandant.</p>
<p>In May, 1775, his father had him transferred to laxer custody at
the</p>
<p>Chateau de Joux, near Pontarlier and the Swiss border. His jailer, M.
de Saint-Mauris, invited him to a party, where he met Sophie de Ruffey,
the nineteen-year-old wife of the seventy-year-old Marquis de Monnier.
She found Mirabeau more satisfying than her husband; his face was
deterring, his hair was woolly, his nose was massive, but his eyes were
on fire, his dis- position was “sulfurous,” and he could seduce any
woman with his speech. Sophie gave herself to him completely. He escaped
from Pontarlier, fled to Thonon in Savoy, and seduced a cousin there. In
August, 1776, Sophie joined him at Verrieres in Switzerland, for, she
said, to live apart from him was “to die a thousand times a day.” 39 Now
she vowed, “Gabriel or death!”</p>
<p>He wen t with her to Amsterdam, where Rousseau’s publisher, Marc Rey,
hired him as a translator. Sophie served as his amanuensis, and taught
Italian. He wrote several minor works, in one of which he spoke of his
father: “He preaches virtue, beneficence, and frugality, while he is the
worst of hus- bands, and the hardest and most spendthrift of fathers.”
40 Mirabeau p£re thought this a breach of etiquette. He united with
Sophie’s parents in ar - ranging the extradition of the couple from
Holland. They were arrested (May 14, 1777) and brought to Paris. Sophie,
having failed in an attempt at suicide, was sent to a house of
correction; Gabriel, raging, was imprisoned in the Chateau de Vincennes,
following in the footsteps of his father and Diderot. There he
languished for forty-two months. After two years he was allowed to have
books, paper, pen, and ink. To Sophie he sent letters of passionate
devotion. On January 7, 1778, she gave birth to a daughter, pre- sumably
his. In June mother ana child were transferred to a convent at Gien,
near Orleans.</p>
<p>Mirabeau appealed to his father to forgive him and have him freed.
“Let me see the sun,” he begged; “let me breathe a freer air; let me see
the fa ce of my kind! I see nothing but dark walls..My father, I shall
die from the tortures</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>953</p>
<p>of nephritis!” 41 To alleviate his misery, to make some money for
Sophie, and to keep from going mad, he wrote several books, some erotic.
Most impor- tant was the Lettres de cachet, which described the
injustices of arrest with- out warrant and detention without trial, and
demanded reform of prisons and the law. Published in 1782, the little
volume so moved Louis XVI that in 1 7 84 he ordered the release of all
the prisoners held at Vincennes. 42</p>
<p>Mirabeau’s jailers took pity on him, and after November, 1779, he was
allowed to walk in the gardens of the chateau and to meet visitors; in
some of these he found outlets for his overflowing sexual energy. 43 His
father agreed to have him liberated if he would apologize to his wife
and resume cohabitation with her, for the old Marquis was anxious to
have a grandson to carry on the family. Gabriel wrote to his wife asking
forgiveness. On December 1 3, 1780, he was released under custody of his
father, who invited him to the paternal mansion at Le Bignon. He had
some liaisons in Paris, and visited Sophie in her convent; apparently he
told her that he intended to rejoin his wife. Then he went to Le Bignon,
and charmed his father. Sophie received money from her husband, moved to
a house near the convent, en- gaged in works of charity, and agreed to
marry an ex-captain of cavalry. He died before the marriage could take
place, and on the next day (September 9, 1789) Sophie killed herself.
44</p>
<p>Mirabeau’s wife refused to see him; he sued her for desertion; he
lost his case, but astonished friends and foes with the eloquence of his
five-hour speech pleading his own impossible cause. His father disowned
him; he sued his father, and obtained from him an allowance of three
thousand francs a year. He borrowed money and lived sumptuously. In 1784
he took a new mistress, Henriette de Nehra. With her he went to England
and Germany (1785-87). En route he had tangential liaisons, which
Henriette forgave, for, she said, “If a woman made him the least
advances he took fire at once.” 45 He met Frederick twice, and learned
enough about Prussia to com - pose (from material supplied him by a
Prussian major) the book De la Monarchic prussienne (1788); this he
dedicated to his father, who described it as “the enormous compilation
of a frenzied workman.” Calonne commis - sioned him to send some secret
dispatches about German affairs; he sent seventy, which amazed the
minister by their keen perception and forceful style.</p>
<p>Back in Paris, he perceived that public discontent was nearing
revolution- ary ardor. In a letter to the minister Montmorin he warned
that unless a States- General met by 1789, revolution would come. “I ask
if you have reckoned with the convulsive energy of hunger acting on the
genius of despair. I ask who will dare make himself responsible for the
safety of all who surround the throne, nay, of the King himself?” 46 He
was caught up in the agitation, and rushed into the current. He achieved
a tenuous reconcilia- tion with his father (who died in 1789), and
offered himself at Aix-en- Provence as a candidate for the
States-General. He invited the nobles of the district to choose him;
they refused; he turned to the Third Estate, which welcomed him. Now he
left his conservative cocoon and took wings as a</p>
<p>954</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>democrat. “The right of sovereignty rests solely… with the people;
the sovereign… can be no more than the first magistrate of the people.”
47 He wished to keep the monarchy, but only as a protection of the
people against the aristocracy; meanwhile he urged that all male adults
should have the vote. 48 In a discourse to the Estates of Provence he
threatened the priv- ileged classes with a gene ral strike: “Take care;
do not disdain this people, which produces everything; this people,
which, to be formidable, need only be immobile.” 49</p>
<p>A bread riot arose in Marseilles (March, 1789); the authorities sent
for Mirabeau to come and calm the people, for they knew his popularity.
The populace gathered in a crowd of 120,000 to acclaim him. 50 He
organized a patrol to prevent violence. In an Avis au peuple marseillais
he advised the commonalty to be patient till the States-General should
have time to find a balance between producers wanting high prices and
consumers wanting low. The rioters obeyed him. By the same
persuasiveness he pacified an uprising at Aix. Both Aix and Marseilles
chose him as their deputy; he thanked the electors, and decided to
represent Aix. In April, 1789, he left for Paris and the
States-General.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE LAST REHEARSAL: 1 789</li>
</ol>
<p>He passed through a country facing famine and rehearsing revolution.
In several districts, in the spring of 1789, there were repeated revolts
against taxes and the cost of bread. In Lyons the populace invaded the
offices of the tax collector and destroyed his registers. At Agde, near
Montpellier, the people threatened a general pillage unless the prices
of commodities were reduced; they were reduced. Villages fearing a
shortage of grain forcibly prevented the export of grain from their
districts. Some peasants talked of burning all chateaux and killing the
seigneurs (May, 1789). 51 At Montlhery the women, hearing that the price
of bread had been raised, led a mob into the granaries and bakeries, and
seized all available bread and flour. Similar scenes at Bray-sur-Seine,
Bagnols, Amiens, almost everywhere in France. In town after town orators
aroused the people by telling them that the King had postponed all tax
payments. 52 A report ran through Provence in March and April that “the
best of kings desires tax equality; that there are to be no</p>
<p>In Paris the excitement mounted almost daily as the meeting of the
States- General approached. Pamphlets poured from the press, oratory
lifted its voice at the cafes and clubs. The most famous and powerful
pamphlet in all history appeared in January, 1789, written by the
freethinking Abbe Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyes, vicar general of the diocese
of Chartres. Cham- fort had written, “Qu’ est -ce que le Tiers etat?
—Tout. Qu’a -t-ilF —Rien.” (“What is the Third Estate? Everything. What
does it have? Nothing.”)</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>955</p>
<p>Sieyes made this explosive epigram into an arresting title, and
turned it into three questions that soon half of France was asking:</p>
<p>What is the Third Estate? Everything.</p>
<p>What has it been, till the present, in the political order?
Nothing.</p>
<p>What does it ask? To become something. 54</p>
<p>Of the 26,000,000 souls in France, Sieyes pointed out, at least
25,000,000 belonged to the Third Estate — the untitled laity; in effect
the Third Estate was the nation. If, in the States-General, the other
classes should refuse to sit with it, it would be justified in
constituting itself the “Assemblee Na - tionale.” That phrase
endured.</p>
<p>Hunger was even more eloquent than words. As relief stations were set
up in Paris by the government, the clergy, and the rich, beggars and
crimi- nals flocked in from the hinterland to eat and to risk their
nothing in acts of desperation. Here and there the populace took matters
into its own hands; it threatened to hang at the nearest lamppost any
merchant hiding grain or charging too much for it; often it stopped and
sacked convoys of grain before these could reach the market; sometimes
it mobbed the markets and took by force, without pay, the grain that
peasants had brought in to sell. 55 On April 23 Necker issued through
the Royal Council a decree empower- ing judges and police to take
inventory of private granaries, and to compel them, where bread was
running short, to send their grain to the market; but this order was
loosely enforced. Such was the picture of Paris in the spring.</p>
<p>In these angry mobs the Due d’Orleans saw a possible instrument for
his ambitions. He was the great- grandson of that Philippe d’Orleans who
had been regent of France (1715-23). Born in 1747, named Due de Chartres
at five, he married at twenty-two Louise-Marie de Bourbon-Penthievre,
whose wealth made him the richest man in France. 56 In 1785 he succeeded
to the title of Due d’Orleans; after 1789, through his advocacy of
popular causes, he was known as Philippe Lgalite. We have seen him
challenging the King in the Parlement and exiled to Villers-Cotterets.
Soon back in Paris, he de- termined to make himself an idol of the
people, hoping that he might be chosen to succeed his cousin Louis XVI
in case the harassed King should abdicate or be deposed. He gave
largesse to the poor, recommended nation- alization of ecclesiastical
property, 57 and threw open to the public the garden and some rooms of
his Palais-Royal in the very heart of Paris. He had the graces of a
generous aristocrat and the morals of his ancestor the Regent. Mme. de
Genlis, governess of his children, served him as liaison with Mira-
beau, Condorcet, Lafayette, Talleyrand, Lavoisier, Volney, Sieyes,
Desmou- lins, Danton. His fellow Freemasons gave him substantial
support. 58 The novelist Choderlos de Laclos, his secretary, acted as
his agent in organizing public demonstrations and revolts. In the
gardens, cafes, gambling houses, and brothels near his palace the
pamphleteers exchanged ideas and formed plans; here thousands of people,
of all classes, joined in the agitations of the hour. The Palais-Royal,
as a name for all this complex, became the hub of the Revolution.</p>
<p>It is alleged and probable, but not certain, that the money of the
Duke,</p>
<p>956</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>and the activity of Choderlos de Laclos, played a part in organizing
the attack upon the Reveillon factory in the Rue St.-Antoine. Reveillon
was leading a revolution of his own: replacing wall paintings and
tapestry with vellum paper painted by artists in a technique developed
by him, and pro- ducing what an English authority has called
“undoubtedly the most beau - tiful wallpape rs that have ever, been
made.” 59 His factory employed three</p>
<p>This was the mood of Paris as the elected deputies and their
substitutes arrived for the States-General at Versailles.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE STATES-GENERAL: 1 789</li>
</ol>
<p>On May 4 the deputies moved in a stately procession to hear Mass in
the Church of St. Louis: the Versailles clergy in front, then the
representatives of the Third Estate, dressed in black, then the noble
delegates, colorful and plumed, then the ecclesiastical deputies, then
the King and Queen, sur- rounded by the royal family. The townspeople
crowded the streets, the balconies, and the roofs; they applauded the
commoners, the King, and the Due d’Orleans, and received with silence
the nobles, the clergy, and the Queen. For a day everyone (except the
Queen) was happy, for what so many had hoped for had come to pass. Many,
even among the nobles, wept at the sight of the divided nation
apparently made one.</p>
<p>On May 5 the deputies assembled in the immense Salle des Menus
Plaisirs (Hall of Minor Diversions), about four hundred yards from the
royal</p>
<p>palace. There were 621 commoners, 308 clergy, 285 nobles (including
twenty of the noblesse de robe). Of the ecclesiastical deputies some two
thirds were of plebeian origin; many of these later threw in their lot
with the commoners. Nearly half the deputies of the Third Estate were
lawyers, five per cent were professional men, thirteen per cent were
businessmen, eight per cent represented the peasantry. 83 Among the
clergy was Charles- Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, bishop of Autun.
Mirabeau, anticipating Napoleon’s phrase about “mud in a silk stocking,”
described Talleyrand as “a vile, greedy, base, intriguing fellow, whose
one desire is mud and money;</p>

<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>957</p>
<p>for money he would sell his soul; and he would be right, for he would
be exchanging a dunghill for gold”; 64 which hardly did justice to
Talleyrand’s flexible intelligence. Among the nobles were several men
who advocated substantial reforms: Lafayette, Condorcet,
Lally-Tollendal, the Vicomte de Noailles, the Dues d’Orleans,
d’Aiguillon, and de La Rochefoucauld -Lian- court. Most of these joined
Sieyes, Mirabeau, and other deputies of the Third Estate in forming Les
Trentes, a “Society of Thirty” which acted as an organizing group for
liberal measures. Prominent in the delegation of the Third Estate were
Mirabeau, Sieyes, Mounier, Barnave, Jean Bailly the as- tronomer, and
Maximilien Robespierre. All in all this was the most distin- guished
political assembly in French annals, perhaps in all modern history.
Generous spirits throughout Europe looked to this gathering to raise a
standard to which the oppressed in every nation might repair.</p>
<p>The King opened the first session with a brief address frankly
confessing the financial distress of his government, ascribing this to
“a costly but hon - orable war,” asking for an “augmentation of taxes,”
and deploring “an ex - aggerated desire for innov ation.” Necker
followed with a three -hour speech admitting a deficit of 56,150,000
livres (it was really 150,000,000), and ask- ing sanction for a loan of
80,000,000 livres. The deputies fidgeted over the brain-taxing
statistics; most of them had expected the liberal minister to expound a
program of reform.</p>
<p>The struggle of the classes began the next day, when the nobles and
the clergy went to separate halls. The general public now forced its way
into the Salle des Menus Plaisirs; soon it was influencing votes by its
vigorous — and usually organized — expression of approval or dissent.
The Third Estate refused to acknowledge itself a separate chamber; it
waited resolutely for the other estates to join it and vote man by man.
The nobles replied that voting by classes — each class one vote — was an
unalterable part of the mo- narchical constitution; to merge the three
classes in one and allow individual voting, in an assembly where the
Third Estate was already half the total and could readily win some
support from the lower clergy, would be to sur- render the intelligence
and character of France to mere number and bour- geois dictation. The
clerical delegates, divided between conservatives and liberals, took no
stand, waiting to be guided by events. A month passed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the price of bread continued to rise despite Necker’s
attempts to regulate it, and the danger of public violence increased.
The flood of pamphlets mounted. Arthur Young wrote on June 9:</p>
<p>The business going forward at present in the pamphlet shops of Paris
is in- credible. I went to the Palais Royal to see what new things were
published, and to procure a catalogue of all. Every hour produces
something new. Thir- teen came out today, sixteen yesterday, ninety-two
last week…. Nineteen twentieths of these productions are in favor of
liberty, and commonly violent against the clergy and the nobility….
Nothing in reply appears. 65</p>
<p>On June 10 the deputies of the Third Estate sent a committee to the
nobles and the clergy again inviting them to a joint meeting, and
declaring that if the other orders continued to meet separately the
Third Estate would</p>
<p>958</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>proceed without them to legislate for the nation. The break in the
contest of collective wills came on June 14, when nine parish priests
came over to the commoners. On that day the Third Estate elected Bailly
its president, and organized itself for deliberation and legislation. On
the fifteenth Sieyes proposed that since the delegates in the Salle des
Menus Plaisirs represented ninety- six per cent of the nation, they
should call themselves the “Assembly of the Recognized and Verified
Representatives of the French Nation.” Mirabeau thought this too broad a
term, which the King would surely reject. Instead of retreating, Sieyes
simplified the proposed name to Assemblee Nationale. It was so voted,
491 to 89. 66 This declaration automatically changed the absolute
monarchy into a limited one, ended the special powers of the upper
classes, and constituted, politically, the beginning of the Revo-
lution.</p>
<p>But would the King accept this demotion? To so incline him the
National Assembly decreed that all existing taxes should be paid as
formerly until the Assembly should be dissolved; that thereafter no
taxes should be paid except those that had been authorized by the
Assembly; that the Assembly would as soon as possible consider the
causes and remedies of the bread shortage; and that after a new
constitution had been accepted the Assembly would assume and honor the
debts of the state. One of these measures aimed to quiet the rioters;
another sought the support of the bondholders; all were cleverly
designed to reduce the resistance of the King.</p>
<p>Louis consulted his Council. Necker warned him that unless the
privileged orders yielded, the States-General would collapse, taxes
would not be paid, and the government would be bankrupt and helpless.
Other ministers pro- tested that individual voting would mean
dictatorship by the Third Estate, and the reduction of the nobility to
political impotence. Feeling that his throne depended upon the nobles
and the clergy, Louis decided to resist the National Assembly. He
announced that he would address the Estates on June 23. Necker,
defeated, offered to resign; the King, knowing that the public would
resent such a move, prevailed upon him to stay.</p>
<p>For the scheduled seance royale the Salle des Menus Plaisirs had to
be prepared by some new physical arrangements. Orders for this were sent
to the palace artisans, without notification to the Assembly. When the
deputies of the Third Estate tried to enter the hall on June 20 they
found its doors shut and the interior occupied by workingmen. Believing
that the King was planning to dismiss them, the deputies moved to a
nearby tennis court (Salle du Jeu de Paume), and took an oath that made
history:</p>
<p>The National Assembly, considering that it has been summoned to
establish the constitution of the kingdom, to effect the regeneration of
public order, and to maintain the true principles of monarchy, that
nothing can prevent it from continuing its deliberations in whatever
place it may be forced to establish itself, and, finally, that
wheresoever its members are assembled, there is the National Assembly,
decrees that all members of this Assembly shall take a solemn oath not
to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances may require, until
the condition of the kingdom is established, and consolidated upon firm
foundations; and that, the said oath taken, all members, and each one of
them individually, shall ratify this steadfast resolution by signature.
67</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>959</p>
<p>All but two of the 557 deputies and twenty alternates who were
present signed; fifty-five more and five priests signed later. When news
of these events reached Paris an angry multitude gathered around the
Palais-Royal and swore to defend the National Assembly at whatever cost.
At Versailles it became dangerous for a nobleman or a prelate to appear
in the streets; several were manhandled, and the Archbishop of Paris
saved himself only by promising to join the Assembly. On June 22 the
sworn deputies met in the Church of St. Louis; there they were joined by
a few nobles and 149 of the 308 ecclesiastical delegates.</p>
<p>On June 23 the three estates met in the Salle des Menus Plaisirs to
hear the King. The hall was surrounded by troops. Necker was
conspicuously absent from the royal retinue. Louis spoke briefly, and
then delegated a secretary of state to read his decision. This rejected
as illegal and void the assumption of the deputies who had declared
themselves a National Assem- bly. It allowed a united meeting of the
three orders, and individual voting on affairs not affecting the class
structure of France; but nothing was to be done to impair “the ancient
and constitutional rights… of property, or the honorifi c privileges… of
the first two orders”; and matters concern - ing religion or the Church
must receive the approval of the clergy. The King conceded to the
States-General the right to veto new taxes and loans; he promised
equality of taxation if the privileged orders voted for it; he offered
to receive recommendations for reform, and to establish provincial
assemblies in which voting would be individual. He agreed to end the
corvee , lettres de cachet, tolls on internal trade, and all vestiges of
serfdom in France. He concluded the session with a brief display of
authority:</p>
<p>If you abandon me in this great enterprise I will work alone for the
welfare of my people…. I will consider myself alone their true
representative…. None of your plans or proceedings can become law
without my express ap- proval…. I command you to separate at once, and
to proceed tomorrow morning each to the hall of his own order to renew
your deliberations. 68</p>
<p>When the King had gone, most of the nobles and a minority of the
clergy departed. The Marquis de Breze, grandmaster of ceremonies,
announced to those deputies who remained that it was the King’s will
that all should leave - ration was s econded by a general cry: “That is
the will of the Assembly.” De Breze withdrew. Orders were given to local
troops to clear the hall, but some liberal nobles persuaded them to take
no action. Told of the situation, the King said, “Oh, well, the devil
with it; let them stay.” 70</p>
<p>On June 24 Young noted in his diary: “The ferment at Paris is beyond
conception; ten thousand people have been all this day in the Palais
Royal…. The constant meetings there are carried to a degree of
licentiousness, and fury of liberty, that is scarcely credible.” 71 The
municipal authorities were unable to maintain order, for they could not
rely upon the local “French Guards”; many of these had relatives who
expounded the popular</p>
<p>960</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>cause to them; some of these soldiers fraternized with the throngs
around the Palais-Royal; in one regiment at Paris there was a secret
society pledged to obey no orders hostile to the National Assembly. On
June 25 the 407 men who had elected the deputies of the Third Estate for
Paris met and substituted themselves for the royal government of the
capital; they chose a new municipal council, nearly all of the middle
class, and the old council abandoned to them the task of protecting life
and property. On that same day forty- seven nobles, led by the Due
d’Orleans, moved over to the Salle des Menus Plaisirs. The victory of
the Assembly seemed secure. Only force could dislodge it.</p>
<p>On June 26, over Necker’s opposition, the conservatives in the King’s
ministry informed him that the local troops in Versailles and Paris
could no longer be trusted to obey orders, and they persuaded him to
send for six provincial regiments. On the twenty-seventh, veering to
Necker ’s advice, Louis bade the noble and ecclesiastical deputations to
unite with the rest. They did, but the nobles refused to take part in
the voting, on the ground that the mandates of their constituents
forbade them to vote individually in the States- General. Most of them,
in the next thirty days, retired to their estates.</p>
<p>On July 1 the King summoned to Paris ten regiments, mostly Germans
and Swiss. In the first weeks of July six thousand troops under the
Marechal de Broglie occupied Versailles, and ten thousand men under the
Baron de Besenval took up positions around Paris, chiefly in the Champ
de Mars. The Assembly and the people believed that the King was planning
to disperse or intimidate them. Some deputies were so fearful of arrest
that they slept in the Salle des Menus Plaisirs instead of going to
their homes at night. 72</p>
<p>Amid this terror the Assembly appointed a committee to draw up plans
for a new constitution. The committee brought in a preliminary report on
July 9, and from that day the deputies called themselves the “National
Con - stituent Assembly.” The dominant sentiment was for a
constitutional mon - archy. Mirabeau argued for “a government more or
less like England’s,” in which the Assembly would be the legislature,
but he continued, in the two years left to him, to urge the retention of
a king. He praised Louis XVI for a good heart and generous intentions,
occasionally confused by shortsighted counselors, and he asked:</p>
<p>Have these men studied, in the history of any people, how revolutions
com- mence and how they are carried out? Have they observed by what a
fatal chain of circumstances the wisest men are driven far beyond the
limits of moderation, and by what terrible impulses an enraged people is
precipitated into excesses at the very thought of which they would have
shuddered ? 73</p>
<p>The Assembly suspected that Mirabeau was being paid by the King or
the Queen to defend the monarchy, but essentially it followed his
advice. The delegates, now predominantly middle class, felt that the
populace was be- coming dangerously unmanageable, and that the only way
to prevent a general disintegration of social order was to maintain, for
some time to come, the present executive structure of the state.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl)</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>961</p>
<p>They were not so well disposed toward the Queen. It was known that
she participated actively in support of the conservative faction in the
Royal Council, and was wielding political power far beyond her
competence. During these critical months she had borne a bereavement
that may have im- paired what capacity she might have had for calm and
prudent judgment. Her older son, the Dauphin Louis, suffered so severely
from rickets and curva- ture of the spine that he could not walk without
help, 74 and on June 4 he died. Broken by grief and fear, Marie
Antoinette was no longer the captivating woman who had frolicked through
the first years of the reign. Her cheeks were pale and thin, her hair
was turning gray, her smiles were wistful, remem- bering happier days;
and her nights were darkened with consciousness of the crowds cursing
her name in Paris and protecting and frightening the As- sembly in
Versailles.</p>
<p>On July 8 Mirabeau put through a motion asking the King to remove
from Versailles the provincial troops that were making the gardens of Le
Notre an armed camp. Louis answered that no harm was intended to the
Assembly, but on July 1 1 he showed his hand by dismissing Necker and
ordering him to leave Paris at once. “All Paris,” Mme. de Stael
recalled, “flocked to visit him in the twenty -four hours allowed him to
prepare for his journey…. Public opinion transformed his disgrace into a
triumph.” 75 He and his family left quietly for the Netherlands. Those
who had sup- ported him in the ministry were discharged at the same
time. On July 12, in complete surrender to the a dvocates of force,
Louis appointed the Queen’s friend, Baron de Breteuil, to replace
Necker, and de Broglie was made secretary for war. The Assembly and its
incipient revolution seemed doomed.</p>
<p>They were saved by the people of Paris.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>TO THE BASTILLE</li>
</ol>
<p>Many factors were leading the populace to pass from agitation to
action. The price of bread was an irritating issue with housewives, and
there was a widespread suspicion that some wholesalers were keeping
their grain from the market in hopes of still higher prices. 76 The new
municipal authorities, fearing that hunger would take to indiscriminate
pillage, sent soldiers to protect the bakeries. With the men of Paris
the burning issue was the knowl- edge that out-of-town regiments, not
yet won to the popular cause, were threatening the Assembly and the
Revolution. The sudden fall of Necker — the only man in the government
whom the people had trusted — brought the anger and fear of the populace
to a point where only a word was needed to arouse a violent response. On
the afternoon of July 1 2 Camille Desmoulins, a Jesuit graduate but now
a radical lawyer, aged twenty-nine, leaped upon a table outside the Cafe
de Foy near the Palais-Royal, denounced the dismissal of Necker as a
betrayal of the people, and cried out, “The Germans [the troops] in the
Champ de Mars will enter Paris tonight to butcher the in-</p>
<p>962</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>habitants!” Then, flourishing both a pistol and a sword, he called
“To arms!” 77 Part of his audience followed him to the Place Vendome,
carrying busts of Necker and the Due d’Orleans; there some troops put
them to flight. In the evening a crowd gathered in the Tuileries
Gardens; a regiment of German troops charged it, was resisted with
bottles and stones, fired upon it and wounded many. Dispersed, the crowd
reassembled at the Hotel de Ville, forced its way in, and seized all the
weapons it could find. Beggars and criminals joined the rioters, and
together they pillaged several homes.</p>
<p>On July 13 the crowd gathered again. They entered the Monastery of
St.-Lazare, appropriated its store of grain, and carried this to the
market at Les Halles. Another crowd opened the prison of La Force and
liberated the inmates, mostly debtors. Everywhere the people searched
for guns; finding only a few, they forged fifty thousand pikes. 78
Fearing for their homes and possessions, the middle classes in Paris
formed and armed their own militia; yet at the same time agents of the
rich continued to encourage, finance, and arm revolutionary crowds,
hoping thereby to deter the King from using force on the Assembly.
79</p>
<p>Early on July 14 a crowd of eight thousand men invaded the Hotel des
Invalides, and captured 32,000 muskets, some powder, and twelve pieces
of artillery. Suddenly someone cried out, “To the Bastille!” Why the Bas
- tille? Not to release its prisoners, who were only seven; and
generally, since 1715, it had been used as a place of genteel
confinement for the well-to-do. But this massive fortress, one hundred
feet high, with walls thirty feet thick, and surrounded by a moat
seventy-five feet wide, had long been a symbol of despotism; it stood in
the public mind for a thousand prisons and secret dungeons; some of the
cahiers had already demanded its destruction. Prob- ably what moved the
crowd was the knowledge that the Bastille had pointed some cannon at the
Rue and Faubourg St. -Antoine, a quarter seething with revolutionary
sentiment. Perhaps most important of all, the Bastille was said to
contain a great store of arms and ammunition, especially powder, of
which the rebels had little. In the fortress was a garrison of
eighty-two French soldiers and thirty-two Swiss Guards, under the
command of the Marquis de Launay, a man of mild temper 80 but popularly
reported to be a monster of cruelty. 81</p>
<p>While the crowd, composed mainly of shopkeepers and artisans, con-
verged upon the Bastille, a deputation from the municipal council was
re- ceived by de Launay. It asked him to withdraw the threatening cannon
from their positions, and not to take any hostile action against the
people; in return it promised to use its influence to dissuade the crowd
from attacking the fortress. The commandant agreed, and entertained the
deputation for lunch. Another committee, from the besiegers themselves,
received de Launay’s pledge that his soldiers would not fire upon the
people unless there was an attempt at forcible entry. This did not
satisfy the excited assemblage; it was resolved to capture the
ammunition without which its muskets could not resist the expected
advance of Besenval’s foreign troops into the city. Be - senval was not
anxious to move into Paris, for he suspected that his men</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DEBACLE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII )</p>
<p>963</p>
<p>would refuse to fire upon the people. He waited for orders from de
Broglie; none came.</p>
<p>About one o’clock in the afternoon eighteen of the rebels climbed the
wall of an adjoining structure, leaped into the forecourt of the
Bastille, and lowered two drawbridges. Hundreds crossed over the moat;
two other drawbridges were lowered; soon the court was filled with an
eager and con- fident crowd. De Launay commanded them to withdraw; they
refused; he ordered his soldiers to fire upon them. The attackers fired
back, and set fire to some wooden structures attached to the stone
walls. Toward three o’clock some members of the radical French Guard
joined the besiegers, and began to bombard the fortress with five of the
cannon that had been taken that morning at the Hotel des Invalides. In
four hours of fighting, ninety-eight of the attackers and one of the
defenders were killed. De Launay, seeing the multitude always increasing
with new arrivals, receiving no word of help from Besenval, and having
no supply of food to stand a siege, bade his sol- diers to cease fire
and hoist a white flag. He offered to surrender if his troops were
allowed to march out, with their arms, to safety. The crowd, infuri-
ated by the sight of its dead, refused to consider anything but
unconditional surrender. 82 De Launay proposed to blow up the fortress;
his men prevented him. He sent down to the assailants the key to the
main entrance. The crowd rushed in, disarmed the soldiers, slew six of
them, seized de Launay, and freed the bewildered prisoners.</p>
<p>While many of the victors took what weapons and ammunition they could
find, part of the crowd led de Launay toward the Hotel de Ville,
apparently intending to have him tried for murder. On the way the more
ardent among them knocked him down, beat him to death, and cut off his
head. With this bleeding trophy held aloft on a pike, they marched
through Paris in a triumphal parade.</p>
<p>That afternoon Louis XVI returned to Versailles from a day’s hunting,
and entered a note into his diary: “July x 4 : Nothing.” Then the Due de
La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, arriving from Paris, told him of the
successful attack upon the Bas tille. “Why,” exclaimed the King, “this
is a revolt!” “No* Sire,” said the Duke, “it is a revolution.”</p>
<p>On July 15 the King went humbly to the Assembly and assured it that
the provincial and foreign troops would be sent away from Versailles and
Paris. On July 16 he dismissed Breteuil and recalled Necker to a third
min- istry. Breteuil, Artois, de Broglie, and other nobles began the
exodus of emigres from France. Meanwhile the populace, with pickaxes and
gun- powder, demolished the Bastille. On July 17 Louis, escorted by
fifty dep- uties of the Assembly, went to Paris, was received at the
Hotel de Ville by the municipal council and the people, and affixed to
his hat the red-white- and-blue cockade of the Revolution.</p>
<p>Envoi</p>
<p>S O we end our survey, in these last two volumes, of the century
whose con- flicts and achievements are still active in the life of
mankind today. We have seen the Industrial Revolution begin with that
Mississippi of inventions whi ch may, by the year two thousand, realize
Aristotle’s dream of machines liberating men from all menial toil. We
have recorded the advances of a dozen sciences toward a better
understanding of nature and a more effective application of her laws. We
have welcomed the passage of philosophy from futile metaphysics to the
tentative pursuit of reason in the mundane affairs of men. We have
followed with living concern the attempt to free religion from
superstition, bigotry, and intolerance, and to organize morality with-
out supernatural punishments and rewards. We have been instructed by the
efforts of statesmen and philosophers to evolve a just and competent
govern- ment, and to reconcile democracy with the simplicity and natural
inequality of men. We have enjoyed the diverse creations of beauty in
baroque, rococo, and neoclassical art, and the triumphs of music in
Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi, in Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart. We have
witnessed the flowering of literature in Germany with Schiller and
Goethe, in England with the great novelists and the greatest of
historians, in Scotland with Boswell and Burns, in Sweden with the
outburst of song under Gustavus III; and in France we have wavered
between Voltaire defending reason with wit and Rousseau plead- ing with
tears for the rights of feeling. We have heard the applause on which
Garrick and Clairon lived. We have admired the succession of fascinating
women in the salons of France and England, and the brilliant reigns of
women in Austria and Russia. We have watched philosopher kings.</p>
<p>It seems absurd to end our story just when so many historic events
were about to enliven and incarnadine the page. We should have been
happy to advance through the turmoil of the Revolution, to contemplate
that volcanic eruption of energy known as Napoleon, and then feast upon
the wealth of the nineteenth century in literature, science, philosophy,
music, art, tech- nology, and statesmanship. Still more we should have
enjoyed coming home to America, South as well as North, and trying to
weave the complex tapes- try of American life and history into one
united and moving picture. But we must reconcile ourselves to mortality,
and leave to fresher spirits the task and risk of adding experiments in
synthesis to the basic researches of his- torical and scientific
specialists.</p>
<p>We have completed, as far as we could go, this Story of Civilization;
and though we have devoted the best part of our lives to the work, we
know that a lif etime is but a moment in history, and that the
historian’s best is soon washed away as the stream of knowledge grows.
But as we followed our studies from century to century we felt confirmed
in our belief that his- 964</p>
<p>EN VO</p>
<p>965</p>
<p>oriography has been too departmentalized, and that some of us should
try to write history whole, as it was lived, in all the facets of the
complex and continuing drama.</p>
<p>Forty years of happy association in the pursuit of history have come
to an end. We dreamed of the day when we should write the last word of
the last volume. Now that that day has come we know that we shall miss
the absorbing purpose that gave meaning and direction to our lives.</p>
<p>We thank the reader who has been with us these many years for part or
all of the long journey. We have ever been mindful of his presence. Now
we take our leave and bid him farewell.</p>
