<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>The Prehistoric Beginnings</p>
<p>of Civilization</p>
<p>I. PALEOLITHIC CULTURE</p>
<p>The purpose of prehistory — The romances of archeology</p>
<p>B UT we have spoken loosely; these primitive cultures that we have
sketched as a means of studying the elements of civilization were not
necessarily the ancestors of our own; for all that we know they may be
the degenerate remnants of higher cultures that decayed when human
leader- ship moved in the wake of the receding ice from the tropics to
the north temperate zone. We have tried to understand how civilization
in general arises and takes form; we have still to trace the
prehistoric* origins of our own particular civilization. We wish now to
inquire briefly — for this is a field that only borders upon our purpose
— by what steps man, before history, prepared for the civilizations of
history: how the man of the jungle or the cave became an Egyptian
architect, a Babylonian astronomer, a Hebrew prophet, a Persian
governor, a Greek poet, a Roman engineer, a Hindu saint, a Japanese
artist, and a Chinese sage. We must pass from anthropology through
archeology to history.</p>
<p>All over the earth seekers are digging into the earth: some for gold,
some for silver, some for iron, some for coal; many of them for
knowledge. What strange busyness of men exhuming paleolithic tools from
the banks of the Somme, studying with strained necks the vivid paintings
on the ceilings of prehistoric caves, unearthing antique skulls at Chou
Kou Tien, revealing the buried cities of Mohenjo-daro or Yucatan,
carrying debris in basket-caravans out of curse-ridden Egyptian tombs,
lifting out of the dust the palaces of Minos and Priam, uncovering the
ruins of Persepolis, burrowing into the soil of Africa for some remnant
of Carthage, recaptur- ing from the jungle the majestic temples of
Angkor! In 1839 Jacques Boucher de Perthes found the first Stone Age
flints at Abbeville, in France;</p>
<ul>
<li>This word will be used as applying to all ages before historical
records.</li>
</ul>
<p>90</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION 91</p>
<p>for nine years the world laughed at him as a dupe. In 1872
Schliemann, with his own money, almost with his own hands, unearthed the
young- est of the many cities of Troy; but all the world smiled
incredulously. Never has any century been so interested in history as
that which followed the voyage of young Champollion with young Napoleon
to Egypt (1796); Napoleon returned empty-handed, but Champollion came
back with all Egypt, past and current, in his grasp. Every generation
since has discov- ered new civilizations or cultures, and has pushed
farther and farther back the frontier of man’s knowledge of his developm
ent. There are not many things finer in our murderous species than this
noble curiosity, this rest- less and reckless passion to understand.</p>
<p>1 . Men of the Old Stone Age</p>
<p>The geological background — Paleolithic types</p>
<p>Immense volumes have been written to expound our knowledge, and
conceal our ignorance, of primitive man. We leave to other imaginative
sciences the task of describing the men of the Old and the New Stone
Age; our concern is to trace the contributions of these “paleolithic”
and “neolithic” cultures to our contemporary life.</p>
<p>The picture we must form as background to the story is of an earth
con- siderably different from that which tolerates us transiently today:
an earth presumably shivering with the intermittent glaciations that
made our now temperate zones arctic for thousands of years, and piled up
masses of rock like the Himalayas, the Alps and the Pyrenees before the
plough of the ad- vancing ice.* If we accept the precarious theories of
contemporary science, the creature who became man by learning to speak
was one of the adaptable species that survived from those frozen
centuries. In the Interglacial Stages, while the ice was retreating
(and, for all we know, long before that), this strange organism
discovered fire, developed the art of fashioning stone and bone into
weapons and tools, and thereby paved the way to civilization.</p>

<p>92 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Various remains have been found which — subject to later correction —
are attributed to this prehistoric man. In 1929 a young Chinese
paleontologist, W. C. Pei, discovered in a cave at Chou Kou Tien, some
thirty-seven miles from Peiping, a skull adjudged to be human by such
experts as the Abbe Breuil and G. Elliot Smith. Near the skull were
traces of fire, and stones obviously worked into tools; but mingled with
these signs of human agency were the bones of animals ascribed by common
consent to the Early Pleisto- cene Epoch, a million years ago.® This
Peking skull is by common opinion the oldest human fossil known to us;
and the tools found with it are the first human artefacts in history. At
Piltdown, in Sussex, England, Dawson and Woodward found in 19 11 some
possibly human fragments now known as “Piltdown Man,” or Eoanthropus
(Dawn Man); the dates assigned to it range spaciously from 1,000,000 to
125,000 b.c. Similar uncertainties attach to the skull and thigh-bones
found in Java in 1891, and the jaw-bone found near Heidelberg in 1907.
The earliest unmistakably human fossils were discovered at Neanderthal,
near Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1857; they date apparently from 40,000
b.c., and so resemble human remains unearthed in Belgium, France and
Spain, and even on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, that a whole race
of “Neanderthal Men” has been pictured as possessing Europe some forty
millenniums before our era. They were short, but they had a cranial ca-
pacity of 1600 cubic centimeters — which is 200 more than ours.*</p>
<p>These ancient inhabitants of Europe seem to have been displaced, some
20,000 b . c ., by a new race, named Cro-Magnon, from the discovery of
its relics (1868) in a grotto of that name in the Dordogne region of
southern France. Abundant remains of like type and age have been exhumed
at various points in France, Switzerland, Germany and Wales. They
indicate a people of magnificent vigor and stature, ranging from five
feet ten inches to six feet four inches in height, and having a skull
capacity of 1590 to 1715 cubic centimeters. 6 Like the Neanderthals,
Cro-Magnon men are known to us as “cave - men,” because their remains
are found in caves; but there is no proof that these were their sole
dwelling-place; it may be again but a jest of time that only those of
them who lived in caves, or died in them, have transmitted their bones
to archeologists. According to present theory this splendid race came
from central Asia through Africa into Europe by land- bridges presumed
to have then connected Africa with Italy and Spain. 0 The distribution
of their fossils suggests that they fought for many decades, per- haps
centuries, a war with the Neanderthals for the possession of Europe; so
old is the conflict between Germany and France. At all events,
Neanderthal Man disappeared; Cro-Magnon Man survived, became the chief
progeni- tor of the modern western European, and laid the bases of that
civilization which we inherit today.</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION 93</p>
<p>The cultural remains of these and other European types of the Old
Stone Age have been classified into seven main groups, according to the
location of the earliest or principal finds in France. All are
characterized by the use of unpolished stone implements. The first three
took form in the precarious interval between the third and fourth
glaciations.</p>
<p>I. The Pre-Chellean Culture or Industry, dating some 125,000</p>
<p>b.c.: most of the flints found in this low layer give little
evidence</p>
<p>of fashioning, and appear to have been used (if at all) as nature</p>
<p>provided them; but the presence of many stones of a shape to fit</p>
<p>the fist, and in some degree flaked and pointed, gives to Pre-</p>
<p>Chellean man the presumptive honor of having made the first</p>
<p>known tool of European man — the coup-de-p oing , or “blow -of-</p>
<p>the- fist” stone.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>The Chellean Culture , ca. 100,000 b.c., improved this tool</li>
</ol>
<p>by roughly flaking it on both sides, pointing it into the shape
of</p>
<p>an almond, and fitting it better to the hand.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>The Acheulean Culture , about 75,000 b.c., left an abun-</li>
</ol>
<p>dance of remains in Europe, Greenland, the United States, Canada,</p>
<p>Mexico, Africa, the Near East, India, and China; it not only</p>
<p>brought the coup-de-poing to greater symmetry and point, but it</p>
<p>produced a vast variety of special tools — hammers, anvils, scrapers,
planes, arrow-heads, spear-heads, and knives; already one sees a</p>
<p>picture of busy human industry.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>The Mousterian Culture is found on all continents, in espe-</li>
</ol>
<p>cial association with the remains of Neanderthal Man, about 40,000
b.c. Among these flints the coup-de-poing is comparatively rare,</p>
<p>as something already ancient and superseded. The implements</p>
<p>were formed from a large single flake, lighter, sharper and
shape-</p>
<p>lier than before, and by skilful hands with a long-established
tra-</p>
<p>dition of artisanship. Higher in the Pleistocene strata of
southern</p>
<p>France appear the remains of</p>
<p>V. The Aurignacian Culture , ca. 25,000 b.c., the first of the</p>
<p>postglacial industries, and the first known culture of Cro-Magnon</p>
<p>Man. Bone tools — pins, anvils, polishers, etc. — were now added to
those of stone; and art appeared in the form of crude engravings</p>
<p>on the rocks, or simple figurines in high relief, mostly of nude</p>
<p>women. 7 At a higher stage of Cro-Magnon development</p>
<p>94 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VI</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>The Solutrean Culture appears ca. 20,000 b.c., in France,</li>
</ol>
<p>Spain, Czechoslovakia and Poland: points, planes, drills, saws,</p>
<p>javelins and spears were added to the tools and weapons of Aurig-</p>
<p>nacian days; slim, sharp needles were made of bone, many imple-</p>
<p>ments were carved out of reindeer horn, and the reindeer’s
antlers</p>
<p>were engraved occasionally with animal figures appreciably supe-</p>
<p>rior to Aurignacian art. Finally, at the peak of Cro-Magnon</p>
<p>growth,</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>The Magdalenian Culture appears throughout Europe</li>
</ol>
<p>about 16,000 b.c.; in industry it was characterized by a large
assort- ment of delicate utensils in ivory, bone and horn, culminating
in</p>
<p>humble but perfect needles and pins; in art it was the age of the</p>
<p>Altamira drawings, the most perfect and subtle accomplishment of</p>
<p>Cro-Magnon Man.</p>
<p>Through these cultures of the Old Stone Age prehistoric man laid the
bases of those handicrafts which were to remain part of the European
heritage until the Industrial Revolution. Their transmission to the
classic and modern civilizations was made easier by the wide spread of
paleolithic in- dustries. The skull and cave-painting found in Rhodesia
in 1921, the flints dis- covered in Egypt by De Morgan in 1896, the
paleolithic finds of Seton-Karr in Somaliland, the Old Stone Age
deposits in the basin of the Fayum,* and the Still Bay Culture of South
Africa indicate that the Dark Continent went through approximately the
same prehistoric periods of development in the art of flaking stone as
those which we have outlined in Europe; 8 perhaps, indeed, the
quasi-Aurignacian remains in Tunis and Algiers strengthen the hypothesis
of an African origin or stopping-point for the Cro-Magnon race, and
there- fore for European man. 0 Paleolithic implements have been dug up
in Syria, India, China, Siberia, and other sections of Asia; 10 Andrews
and his Jesuit predecessors came upon them in Mongolia; 11 Neanderthal
skeletons and Mous- terian-Aurignacian flints have been exhumed in great
abundance in Palestine; and we have seen how the oldest known human
remains and implements have lately been unearthed near Peiping. Bone
tools have been discovered in Nebraska which some patriotic authorities
would place at 500,000 b.c.; arrow- heads have been found in Oklahoma
and New Mexico which their finders assure us were made in 350,000 b.c.
So vast was the bridge by which pre- historic transmitted the
foundations of civilization to historic man.</p>

<p>THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Arts of the Old Stone Age</li>
</ol>
<p>Tools — Fire — Fainting — Sculpture</p>
<p>If now we sum up the implements fashioned by paleolithic man we shall
gain a clearer idea of his life than by giving loose rein to our fancy.
It was natural that a stone in the fist should be the first tool; many
an animal could have taught that to man. So the coup-de-poing — a rock
sharp at one end, round at the other to fit the palm of the hand —
became for pri- meval man hammer, axe, chisel, scraper, knife and saw;
even to this day the word hammer means, etymologically, a stone. 13
Gradually these spe- cific tools were differentiated out of the one
homogeneous form: holes were bored to attach a handle, teeth were
inserted to make a saw, branches were tipped with the coup-de-poing to
make a pick, an arrow or a spear. The scraper-stone that had the shape
of a shell became a shovel or a hoe; the rough-surfaced stone became a
file; the stone in a sling became a weapon of war that would survive
even classical antiquity. Given bone, wood and ivory as well as stone,
and paleolithic man made himself a varied assortment of weapons and
tools: polishers, mortars, axes, planes, scrapers, drills, lamps,
knives, chisels, choppers, lances, anvils, etchers, daggers, fish-hooks,
harpoons, wedges, awls, pins, and doubtless many more. 14 Every day he
stumbled upon new knowledge, and sometimes he had the wit to develop his
chance discoveries into purposeful inventions.</p>
<p>But his great achievement was fire. Darwin has pointed out how the
hot lava of volcanoes might have taught men the art of fire; according
to TEschylus, Prometheus established it by igniting a narthex stalk in
the burning crater of a volcano on the isle of Lemnos. 16 Among
Neanderthal remains we find bits of charcoal and charred bones; man-made
fire, then, is at least 40,000 years old. ” Cro -Magnon man ground stone
bowls to hold the grease that he burned to give him light: the lamp,
therefore, is also of considerable age. Presumably it was fire that
enabled man to meet the threat of cold from the advancing ice; fire that
left him free to sleep on the earth at night, since animals dreaded the
marvel as much as primitive men worshiped it; fire that conquered the
dark and began that lessening of fear which is one of the golden threads
in the not quite golden web of history; fire that created the old and
honorable art of cooking, extending the diet of man to a thousand foods
inedible before; fire that led at last</p>
<p>96 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>to the fusing of metals, and the only real advance in technology from
Cro- Magnon days to the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<p>Strange to relate — and as if to illustrate Gautier’s lines on robust
art outlasting emperors and states — our clearest relics of paleolithic
man are fragments of his art. Sixty years ago Senor Marcelino de
Sautuola came up- on a large cave on his estate at Altamira, in northern
Spain. For thousands of years the entrance had been hermetically sealed
by fallen rocks naturally cemented with stalagmite deposits. Blasts for
new construction accident- ally opened the entrance. Three years later
Sautuola explored the cave, and noticed some curious markings on the
walls. One day his little daugh- ter accompanied him. Not compelled,
like her father, to stoop as she walked through the cave, she could look
up and observe the ceiling. There she saw, in vague outline, the
painting of a great bison, magnificently colored and drawn. Many other
drawings were found on closer exami- nation of the ceiling and the
walls. When, in 1880, Sautuola published his report on these
observations, archeologists greeted him with genial scepticism. Some did
him the honor of going to inspect the drawings, only to pronounce them
the forgery of a hoaxer. For thirty years this quite reasonable
incredulity persisted. Then the discovery of other draw- ings in caves
generally conceded to be prehistoric (from their contents of unpolished
flint tools, and polished ivory and bone) confir med Sautuola’s
judgment; but Sautuola now was dead. Geologists came to Altamira and
testified, with the unanimity of hindsight, that the stalagmite coating
on many of the drawings was a paleolithic deposit.” General opinion now
places these Altamira drawings — and the greater portion of extant pre-
historic art — in the Magdalenian culture, some 16,000 B.c.” Paintings
slight - ly later in time, but still of the Old Stone Age, have been
found in many caves of France.*</p>
<p>Most often the subjects of these drawings are animals — reindeers,
mam- moths, horses, boars, bears, etc.; these, presumably, were dietetic
luxuries, and therefore favorite objects of the chase. Sometimes the
animals are transfixed with arrows; these, in the view of Frazer and
Reinach, were intended as magic images that would bring the animal under
the power, and into the stomach, of the artist or the hunter.”
Conceivably they were</p>
<ul>
<li>Combarelles, Les Eyzies, Font de Gaume, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION 97</p>
<p>representation should have sufficed the purposes of magic, whereas
these paintings are often of such delicacy, power and skill as to
suggest the un- happy thought that art, in this field at least, has not
advanced much in the long course of human history. Here is life, action,
nobility, conveyed over- whelmingly with one brave line or two; here a
single stroke (or is it that the others have faded?) creates a living,
charging beast. Wi ll Leonardo’s Last Supper, or El Greco’s Assumption,
bear up as well as these Cro - Magnon paintings after twenty thousand
years?</p>
<p>Painting is a sophisticated art, presuming many centuries of mental
and technical development. If we may accept current theory (which it is
always a perilous thing to do), painting developed from statuary, by a
passage from carving in the round to bas-relief and thence to mere
outline and coloring; painting is sculpture minus a dimension. The
intermediate prehistoric art is well represented by an astonishingly
vivid bas-relief of an archer (or a spear- man) on the Aurignacian
cliffs at Laussel in France. 21 In a cave in Ariege, France, Louis
Begouen discovered, among other Magdalenian relics, several ornamental
handles carved out of reindeer antlers; one of these is of mature and
excellent workmanship, as if the art had already generations of
tradition and development behind it. Throughout the prehistoric
Mediterranean — Egypt, Crete, Italy, France and Spain — countless
figures of fat little women are found, which indicate either a worship
of motherhood or an African conception of beauty. Stone statues of a
wild horse, a reindeer and a mam- moth have been unearthed in
Czechoslovakia, among remains uncertainly ascribed to 30,000 b.c. 23</p>
<p>The whole interpretation of history as progress falters when we con-
sider that these statues, bas-reliefs and paintings, numerous though
they are, may be but an infinitesimal fraction of the art that expressed
or adorned the life of primeval man. What remains is found in caves,
where the elements were in some measure kept at bay; it does not follow
that pre- historic men were artists only when they were in caves. They
may have curved as sedulously and ubiquitously as the Japanese, and may
have fashioned statuary as abundantly as the Greeks; they may have
painted not only the rocks in their caverns, but textiles, wood,
everything — not excepting themselves. They may have created
masterpieces far superior to the fragments that survive. In one grotto a
tube was discovered, made from the bones of a reindeer, and filled with
pigment ; 23 in another a stone palette</p>

<p>was picked up still thick with red ochre paint despite the transit of
two hundred centuries. 24 Apparently the arts were highly developed and
widely practised eighteen thousand years ago. Perhaps there was a class
of professional artists among paleolithic men; perhaps there were Bohem-
ians starving in the less respectable caves, denouncing the commercial
bour- geoisie, plotting the death of academies, and forging
antiques.</p>

<p>science — Summary of the prehistoric preparation</p>
<p>for civilization</p>
<p>At various times in the last one hundred years great heaps of
seemingly prehistoric refuse have been found, in France, Sardinia,
Portugal, Brazil, Japan and Manchuria, but above all in Denmark, where
they received that queer name of Kitchen-Middens (Kjokken-moddinger) by
which such ancient messes are now generally known. These rubbish heaps
are composed of shells, especially of oysters, mussels and periwinkles;
of the bones of various land and marine animals; of tools and weapons of
horn, bone and unpolished stone; and of mineral remains like charcoal,
ashes and broken pottery. These unprepossessing relics are apparently
signs of a culture formed about the eighth millennium before Christ —
later than the true paleolithic, and yet not properly neolithic, because
not yet arrived at the use of polished stone. We know hardly anything of
the men who left these remains, except that they had a certain catholic
taste. Along with the slightly older culture of the Mas- d’Azil, in
France, the Middens represent a “mesolithic” (middle -stone) or
transition period between the paleolithic and the neolithic age.</p>
<p>In the year 1854, the winter being unusually dry, the level of the
Swiss lakes sank, and revealed another epoch in prehistory. At some two
hun- dred localities on these lakes piles were found which had stood in
place under the water for from thirty to seventy centuries. The piles
were so arranged as to indicate that small villages had been built upon
them, per- haps for isolation or defense; each was connected with the
land only by a narrow bridge, whose foundations, in some cases, were
still in place; here and there even the framework of the houses had
survived the patient play</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION 99</p>
<p>of the waters.* Amid these ruins were tools of bone and polished
stone which became for archeologists the distinguishing mark of the New
Stone Age that flourished some 10,000 b.c. in Asia, and some 5000 b.c.
in Europe. 28 Akin to these remains are the gigantic tumuli left in the
valleys of the Mississippi and its tributaries by the strange race that
we call the Mound- Builders, and of which we know nothing except that in
these mounds, shaped in the form of altars, geometric figures, or totem
animals, are found objects of stone, shell, bone and beaten metal which
place these mysterious men at the end of the neolithic period.</p>
<p>If from such remains we attempt to patch together some picture of the
New Stone Age, we find at once a startling innovation — agriculture. In
one sense all human history hinges upon two revolutions: the neolithic
pas- sage from hunting to agriculture, and the modem passage from
agriculture to industry; no other revolutions have been quite as real or
basic as these. The remains show that the Lake-Dwellers ate wheat,
millet, rye, barley and oats, besides one hundred and twenty kinds of
fruit and many varie- ties of nut. 20 No ploughs have been found in
these ruins, probably because the first ploughshares were of wood — some
strong tree-trank and branch fitted with a flint edge; but a neolithic
rock-carving unmistakably shows a peasant guiding a plough drawn by two
oxen. 30 This marks the appear- ance of one of the epochal inventions of
history. Before agriculture the earth could have supported (in the rash
estimate of Sir Arthur Keith) only some twenty million men, and the
lives of these were shortened by the mortality of the chase and war; 31
now began that multiplication of man- kind which definitely confirmed
man’s mastery of the planet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the men of the New Stone Age were establishing another of
the foundations of civilization: the domestication and breeding of
animals. Doubtless this was a long process, probably antedating the
neolithic period. A certain natural sociability may have contributed to
the associa- tion of man and animal, as we may still see in the delight
that primitive people take in taming wild beasts, and in filling their
huts with monkeys, parrots and similar companions. 32 The oldest bones

<li>Remains of similar lake dwellings have been found in France, Italy,
Scotland, Russia, North America, India, and elsewhere. Such villages
still exist in Borneo, Sumatra, New Guinea, etc. 20 Venezuela owes its
name (Little Venice) to the fact that when Alonso de Ojeda discovered it
for Europe (1499) he found the natives living in pile-dwellings on Lake
Maracaibo. 27</li>

<p>IOO THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. VI</p>
<p>(ca. 8000 b.c.) are those of the dog — the most ancient and honorable
com- panion of the human race. A little later (ca. 6000 b.c.) came the
goat, the sheep, the pig and the ox. 33 Finally the horse, which to
paleolithic man had been, if we may judge from the cave drawings, merely
a beast of prey, was taken into camp, tamed, and turned into a beloved
slave; 34 in a hundred ways he was now put to work to increase the
leisure, the wealth, and the power of man. The new lord of the earth
began to replenish his food- supply by breeding as well as hunting; and
perhaps he learned, in this same neolithic age, to use cow’s milk as
food.</p>
<p>Neolithic inventors slowly improved and extended the tool-chest and
armory of man. Here among the remains are pulleys, levers, grindstones,
awls, pincers, axes, hoes, ladders, chisels, spindles, looms, sickles,
saws, fish-hooks, skates, needles, brooches and pins. 35 Here, above
all, is the wheel, another fundamental invention of mankind, one of the
modest essentials of industry and civilization; already in this New
Stone Age it was developed into disc and spoked varieties. Stones of
every sort — even obdurate diorite and obsidian — were ground, bored,
and finished into a polished form. Flints were mined on a large scale.
In the ruins of a neo- lithic mine at Brandon, England, eight worn picks
of deerhom were found, on whose dusty surfaces were the finger-prints of
the workmen who had laid down those tools ten thousand years ago. In
Belgium the skeleton of such a New Stone Age miner, who had been crushed
by falling rock, was discovered with his deerhom pick still clasped in
his hands; 33 across a hun- dred centuries we feel him as one of us, and
share in weak imagination his terror and agony. Through how many bitter
millenniums men have been tearing out of the bowels of the earth the
mineral bases of civilization!</p>
<p>Having made needles and pins man began to weave; or, beginning to
weave, he was moved to make needles and pins. No longer content to
clothe himself with the furs and hides of beasts, he wove the wool of
his sheep and the fibres found in the plants into garments from which
came the robe of the Hindu, the toga of the Greek, the skirt of the
Egyptian, and all the fascinat- ing gamut of human dress. Dyes were
mixed from the juices of plants or the minerals of the earth, and
garments were stained with colors into luxuries for kings. At first men
seem to have plaited textiles as they plaited straw, by interlacing one
fibre with another; then they pierced holes into animal skins, and bound
the skins with coarse fibres passing through the holes, as with the
corsets of yesterday and the shoes of today; gradually the fibres</p>
<p>IOI</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>were refined into thread, and sewing became one of the major arts of
woman- kind. The stone distaffs and spindles among the neolithic ruins
reveal one of the great origins of human industry. Even mirrors are
found in these re- mains *, 37 everything was ready for
civilization.</p>
<p>No pottery has been discovered in the earlier paleolithic graves;
fragments of it appear in the remains of the Magdalenian culture in
Belgium , 38 but it is only in the mesolithic Age of the Kitchen-Middens
that we find any de- veloped use of earthenware. The origin of the art,
of course, is unknown. Perhaps some observant primitive noticed that the
trough made by his foot in clay held water with little seepage ; 89
perhaps some accidental baking of a piece of wet clay by an adjoining
fire gave him the hint that fertilized inven- tion, and revealed to him
the possibilities of a material so abounding in quan- tity, so pliable
to the hand, and so easy to harden with fire or the sun. Doubt- less he
had for thousands of years carried his food and drink in such natural
containers as gourds and coconuts and the shells of the sea; then he had
made himself cups and ladles of wood or stone, and baskets and hampers
of rushes or straw; now he made lasting vessels of baked clay, and
created another of the major industries of mankind. So far as the
remains indicate, neolithic man did not know the potter’s wheel; but
with his own hands he fashioned clay into forms of beauty as well as
use, decorated it with simple designs , 40 and made pottery, almost at
the outset, not only an industry but an art.</p>
<p>Here, too, we find the first evidences of another major industry —
building. Paleolithic man left no known trace of any other home than the
cave. But in the neolithic remains we find such building devices as the
ladder, the pulley, the lever, and the hinge . 41 The Lake-Dwellers were
skilful carpenters, fastening beam to pile with sturdy wooden pins, or
mortising them head to head, or strengthening them with crossbeams
notched into their sides. The floors were of clay, the walls of
wattle-work coated with clay, the roofs of bark, straw, rushes or reeds.
With the aid of the pulley and the wheel, building materials were
carried from place to place, and great stone founda- tions were laid for
villages. Transport, too, became an industry: canoes were built, and
must have made the lakes live with traffic; trade was carried on over
mountains and between distant continents . 42 Amber, diorite, jadeite
and obsidian were imported into Europe from afar . 43 Similar words,
letters, myths, pottery and designs betray the cultural contacts of
diverse groups of prehistoric men . 44</p>
<p>Outside of *pottery the New Stone Age has left us no art, nothing to
com- pare with the painting and statuary of paleolithic man. Here and
there among the scenes of neolithic life from England to China we find
circular heaps of stone called dolmens, upright monoliths called
menhirs, and gigantic</p>
<p>102 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>cromlechs — stone structures of unknown purpose — like those at
Stonehenge or in Morbihan. Probably we shall never know the meaning or
function of these megaliths; presumably they are the remains of altars
and temples. 45 For neolithic man doubtless had religions, myths with
which to dramatize the daily tragedy and victory of the sun, the death
and resurrection of the soil, and the strange earthly influences of the
moon; we cannot understand the historic faiths unless we postulate such
prehistoric origins. 46 Perhaps the arrangement of the stones was
determined by astronomic considerations, and suggests, as Schneider
thinks, an acquaintance with the calendar. 47 Some scientific knowledge
was present, for certain neolithic skulls give evidence of trephining;
and a few skeletons reveal limbs apparently broken and reset. 48</p>
<p>We cannot properly estimate the achievements of prehistoric men, for
we must guard against describing their life with imagination that tran-
scends the evidence, while on the other hand we suspect that time has
destroyed remains that would have narrowed the gap between primeval and
modern man. Even so, the surviving record of Stone Age advances is
impressive enough: paleolithic tools, fire, and art; neolithic
agriculture, animal breeding, weaving, pottery, building, transport, and
medicine, and the definite domination and wider peopling of the earth by
the human race. All the bases had been laid; everything had been
prepared for the historic civilizations except ( perhaps ) metals,
writing and the state. Let men find a way to record their thoughts and
achievements, and thereby transmit them more securely across the
generations, and civilization would begin.</p>

<li>The Coming of Metals</li>

<p>Copper — Bronze — Iron</p>
<p>When did the use of metals come to man, and how? Again we do not
know; we merely surmise that it came by accident, and we presume, from
the absence of earlier remains, that it began towards the end of the
Neolithic Age. Dating this end about 4000 b.c., we have a perspective in
which the Age of Metals (and of writing and civilization) is a mere six
thousand years appended to an Age of Stone lasting at least forty
thousand years, and an Age of Man lasting* a million years. So young is
the subject of our history.</p>
<p>The oldest known metal to be adapted to human use was copper. We find
it in a Lake-Dwelling at Robenhausen, Switzerland, ca. 6000 b.c .; 40 in

<p>CHAP. VI ) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION IO3</p>
<p>historic Mesopotamia ca. 4500 b.c.; in the Badarian graves of Egypt
towards 4000 b.c.; in the ruins of Ur ca. 3100 b.c.; and in the relics
of the North American Mound-Builders at an unknown age. 60 The Age of
Metals began not with their discovery, but with their transformation to
human purpose by fire and working. Metallurgists believe that the first
fusing of copper out of its stony ore came by haphazard when a primeval
camp fire melted the copper lurking in the rocks that enclosed the
flames; such an event has often been seen at primitive camp fires in our
own day. Possibly this was the hint which, many times repeated, led
early man, so long content with refractory stone, to seek in this
malleable metal a substance more easily fashioned into durable weapons
and tools. 51 Presumably the metal was first used as it came from the
profuse but careless hand of nature — sometimes nearly pure, most often
grossly alloyed. Much later, doubtless — apparently about 3500 b.c. in
the region around the Eastern Mediterranean — men discovered the art of
smelting, of extracting metals from their ores. Then, towards 1500 b.c.
(as we may judge from bas-reliefs on the tomb of Rekh-mara in Egypt),
they proceeded to cast metal: dropping the molten copper into a clay or
sand receptacle, they let it cool into some desired form like a
spear-head or an axe. 53 That process, once discovered, was applied to a
great variety of metals, and provided man with those doughty elements
that were to build his great- est industries, and give him his conquest
of the earth, the sea, and the air. Perhaps it was because the Eastern
Mediterranean lands were rich in copper that vigorous new cultures
arose, in the fourth millennium b.c., in Elam, Aleso- potamia and Egypt,
and spread thence in all directions to transform the world. 53</p>
<p>But copper by itself was soft, admirably pliable for some purposes
(what would our electrified age do without it?), but too weak for the
heavier tasks of peace and war; an alloy was needed to harden it. Though
nature sug- gested many, and often gave man copper already mixed and
hardened with tin or zinc — forming, therefore, ready-made bronze or
brass — he may have dallied for centuries before taking the next step:
the deliberate fusing of metal with metal to make compounds more suited
to his needs. The dis- covery is at least five thousand years old, for
bronze is found in Cretan re- mains of 3000 b.c., in Egyptian remains of
2800 b.c., and in the second city of Troy 2000 b.c. 54 We can no longer
speak strictly of an “Age of Bronze,” for the metal came to different
peoples at diverse epochs, and the term would therefore be without
chronological meaning; 55 furthermore, some cul- tures — like those of
Finland, northern Russia, Polynesia, central Africa, south- ern India,
North America, Australia and Japan — passed over the Bronze Age directly
from stone to iron; 66 and in those cultures where bronze appears it
seems to have had a subordinate place as a luxury of priests,
aristocrats and</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>kings* while commoners had still to be content with stone. 57 Even
the terms “Old Stone Age” and “New Stone Age” are precariously relative,
and de - scribe conditions rather than times; to this day many primitive
peoples (e.g., the Eskimos and the Polynesian Islanders) remain in the
Age of Stone, know- ing iron only as a delicacy brought to them by
explorers. Captain Cook bought several pigs for a sixpenny nail when he
landed in New Zealand in 1778; and another traveler described the
inhabitants of Dog Island as “covet - ous chiefly of iron, so as to want
to take the nails out of the ship.” 58 Bronze is strong and durable, but
the copper and tin which were needed to make it were not available in
such convenient quantities and locations as to provide man with the best
material for industry and war. Sooner or later iron had to come; and it
is one of the anomalies of history that, being so abundant, it did not
appear at least as early as copper and bronze. Men may have begun the
art by making weapons out of meteoric iron as the Mound- Builders seem
to have done, and as some primitive peoples do to this day; then,
perhaps, they melted it from the ore by fire, and hammered it into
wrought iron. Fragments of apparently meteoric iron have been found in
predynastic Egyptian tombs; and Babylonian inscriptions mention iron as
a costly rarity in Hammurabi’s capital (2100 b.c.). An iron foundry
perhaps four thousand years old has been discovered in Northern
Rhodesia; mining in South Africa is no modern invention. The oldest
wrought iron known is a group of knives found at Gerar, in Palestine,
and dated by Petrie about 1350 b.c. A century later the metal appears in
Egypt, in the reign of the great Rameses II; still another century and
it is found in the iEgean. In Western Europe it turns up first at
Hallstatt, Austria, ca. 900 b.c., and in the La Tene industry in
Switzerland ca. 500 b.c. It entered India with Alex- ander, America with
Columbus, Oceania with Cook. 50 In this leisurely way, century by
century, iron has gone about its rough conquest of the earth.</p>

<li>Writing</li>
</ol>
<p>Its possible ceramic origins —The “ Mediterranean Signary” —</p>
<p>Hieroglyphics — Alphabets</p>
<p>But by far the most important step in the passage to civilization was
writing. Bits of pottery from neolithic remains show, in some cases,
painted lines which several students have interpreted as signs . 60 This
is doubtful enough; but it is possible that writing, in the broad sense
of graphic sym- bols of specific thoughts, began with marks impressed by
nails or fingers upon the still soft clay to adorn or identify pottery.
In the earliest Sumer- ian hieroglyphics the pictograph for bird bears a
suggestive resemblance</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION IO5</p>
<p>to the bird decorations on the oldest pottery at Susa, in Elam; and
the earliest pictograph for grain is taken directly from the geometrical
grain- decoration of Susan and Sumerian vases. The linear script of
Sumeria, on its first appearance (ca. 3600 b.c.), is apparently an
abbreviated form of the signs and pictures painted or impressed upon the
primitive pottery of lower Mesopotamia and Elam. 604 Writing, like
painting and sculpture, is probably in its origin a ceramic art; it
began as a form of etching and drawing, and the same clay that gave
vases to the potter, figures to the sculptor and bricks to the builder,
supplied writing materials to the scribe. From such a beginning to the
cuneiform writing of Mesopotamia would be an intelligible and logical
development.</p>
<p>The oldest graphic symbols known to us are those found by Flinders
Petrie on shards, vases and stones discovered in the prehistoric tombs
of Egypt, Spain and the Near East, to which, with his usual generosity,
he attributes an age of seven thousand years. This “Mediterranean
Signary” numbered some three hundred signs; most of them were the same
in all localities, indicating commercial bonds from one end of the
Mediterranean to the other as far back as 5000 b.c. They were not
pictures but chiefly mer- cantile symbols — marks of property, quantity,
or other business memoranda; the berated bourgeoisie may take
consolation in the thought that literature originated in bills of
lading. The signs were not letters, since they repre- sented entire
words or ideas; but many of them were astonishingly like letters of the
“Phoenician” alphabet. Petrie concludes that “a wide body of signs had
been gradually brought into use in primitive times for various pur-
poses. These were interchanged by trade, and spread from land to land, …
until a couple of dozen signs triumphed and became common property to a
group of trading communities, while the local survivals of other forms
were gradually extingu ished in isolated seclusion.” 01 That this
signary was the source of the alphabet is an interesting theory, which
Professor Petrie has the distinction of holding alone. 63</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the development of these early commercial
symbols, there grew up alongside them a form of writing which was a
branch of drawing and painting, and conveyed connected thought by
pictures. Rocks near Lake Superior still bear remains of the crude
pictures with which the American Indians proudly narrated for posterity,
or more probably for their associates, the story of their crossing the
mighty lake. 63 A similar evolution of drawing into writing seems to
haye taken place throughout the Mediterranean world at the end of the
Neolithic Age.</p>
<p>IO 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Certainly by 3600 b.c., and probably long before that, Elam, Sumeria
and Egypt had developed a system of thought-pictures, called
hieroglyphics because practised chiefly by the priests.* A similar
system appeared in Crete ca. 2500 b.c. We shall see later how these
hieroglyphics, represent- ing thoughts, were, by the corruption of use,
schematized and convention- alized into syllabaries — i.e., collections
of signs indicating syllables; and how at last signs were used to
indicate not the whole syllable but its initial sound, and therefore
became letters. Such alphabetic writing probably dates back to 3000 b.c.
in Egypt; in Crete it appears ca. 1600 b.c. 66 The Phoenicians did not
create the alphabet, they marketed it; taking it appar- ently from Egypt
and Crete, 66 they imported it piecemeal to Tyre, Sidon and Byblos, and
exported it to every city on the Mediterranean; they were the middlemen,
not the producers, of the alphabet. By the time of Homer the Greeks were
taking over this Phoenician — or the allied Aramaic — alpha- bet, and
were calling it by the Semitic names of the first two letters</p>
<p>(Alpha, Beta; Hebrew Aleph, Beth)”</p>
<p>Writing seems to be a product and convenience of commerce; here again
culture may see how much it owes to trade. When the priests de- vised a
system of pictures with which to write their magical, ceremonial and
medical formulas, the secular and clerical strains in history, usually
in conflict, merged for a moment to produce the greatest human invention
since the coming of speech. The development of writing almost created
civilization by providing a means for the recording and transmission of
knowledge, the accumulation of science, the growth of literature, and
the spread of peace and order among varied but communicating tribes
brought by one language under a single state. The earliest appearance of
writing marks that ever-receding point at which history begins.</p>

<p>In approaching now the history of civilized nations we must note that
not only shall we be selecting a mere fraction of each culture for our
study, but we shall be describing perhaps a minority of the
civilizations that have probably existed on the earth. We cannot
entirely ignore the legends, current throughout history, of
civilizations once great and cultured, de- stroyed by some catastrophe
of nature or war, and leaving not a wrack</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>behind; our recent exhuming of the civilizations of Crete, Sumeria
and Yucatan indicates how true such tales may be.</p>
<p>The Pacific contains the ruins of at least one of these lost
civiliza-</p>
<p>tions. The gigantic statuary of Easter Island, the Polynesian
tradition of powerful nations and heroic warriors once ennobling Samoa
and Tahiti, the artistic ability and poetic sensitivity of their present
inhabitants, indi- cate a glory departed, a people not rising to
civilization but fallen from a high estate. And in the Atlantic, from
Iceland to the South Pole, the raised central bed of the oceans* lends
some support to the legend so fascinatingly transmitted to us by Plato,“
of a civilization that once flour- ished on an island continent between
Europe and Asia, and was suddenly lost when a geological convulsion
swallowed that continent into the sea. Schliemann, the resurrector of
Troy, believed that Atlantis had served as a mediating link between the
cultures of Europe and Yucatan, and that Egyptian civilization had been
brought from Atlantis.“ Perhaps America itself was Atlantis, and some
pre-Mayan culture may have been in touch with Africa and Europe in
neolithic times. Possibly every discovery is a rediscovery.</p>
<p>Certainly it is probable, as Aristotle thought, that many
civilizations</p>
<p>came, made great inventions and luxuries, were destroyed, and lapsed
from human memory. History, said Bacon, is the planks of a shipwreck;
more of the past is lost than has been saved. We console ourselves with
the thought that as the individual memory must forget the greater part
of experience in order to be sane, so the race has preserved in its
heritage only the most vivid and impressive — or is it only the
best-recorded? — of its cultural experiments. Even if that racial
heritage were but one tenth as rich as it is, no one could possibly
absorb it all. We shall find the story full enough.</p>

<p>any metaphysics, the arid regions of central Asia were once moist and
tem- perate, nourished with great lakes and abundant streams.™ The
recession of the last ice wave slowly dried up this area, until the
rainfall was insuffi - cient to support towns and states. City after
city was abandoned as men fled west and east, north and south, in search
of water; half buried in the desert lie ruined cities like Bactra, which
must have held a teeming popu- lation within its twenty-two miles of
circumference. As late as 1868 some 80,000 inhabitants of western
Turkestan were forced to migrate because their district was being
inundated by the moving sand.” The re are many who believe that these
now dying regions saw the first substantial develop- ment of that vague
complex of order and provision, manners and morals, comfort and culture,
which constitutes civilization.™</p>
<p>In 1907 Pumpelly unearthed at Anau, in southern Turkestan, pottery
and other remains of a culture which he has ascribed to 9000 b.c., with
a possible exaggeration of four thousand years.™ Here we find the
cultiva - tion of wheat, barley and millet, the use of copper, the
domestication of animals, and the ornamentation of pottery in styles so
conventionalized as to suggest an artistic background and tradition of
many centuries.” Ap - parently the culture of Turkestan was already very
old in 5000 b.c. Per- haps it had historians who delved into its past in
a vain search for the origins of civilization, and philosophers who
eloquently mourned the de- generation of a dying race.</p>
<p>From this center, if we may imagine where we cannot know, a people
driven by a rainless sky and betrayed by a desiccated earth migrated in
three directions, bringing their arts and civilization with them. The
arts, if not the race, reached eastward to China, Manchuria and North
America; southward to northern India; westward to Elam, Sumeria, Egypt,
even to Italy and Spain.™ At Susa, in ancient Elam (modern Persia),
remains have been found so similar in type to those at Anau that the
re-creative imagina- tion is almost justified in presuming cultural
communication between Susa and Anau at the dawn of civilizati on (ca.
4000 b.c.).™ A like kinship of early arts and products suggests a like
relationship and continuity be- tween prehistoric Mesopotamia and
Egypt.</p>
<p>We cannot be sure which of these cultures came first, and it does not
much matter; they were in essence of one family and one type. If we
violate honored precedents here and place Elam and Sumeria before Egypt,
it is from no vainglory of unconventional innovation, but rather
because</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION 109</p>
<p>the age of these Asiatic civilizations, compared with those of Africa
and Europe, grows as our knowledge of them deepens. As the spades of
