<p>Orient-ation — Contributions of the Near East to Western</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>W RITTEN history is at least six thousand years old. During half
of</p>
<p>his period the center of human affairs, so far as they are now known
to us, was in the Near East. By this vague term we shall mean here all
southwestern Asia south of Russia and the Black Sea, and west of India
and Afghanistan; still more loosely, we shall include within it Egypt,
too, as anciently bound up with the Near East in one vast web and
communicat- ing complex of Oriental civilization. In this rough theatre
of teeming peoples and conflicting cultures were developed the
agriculture and com- merce, the horse and wagon, the coinage and letters
of credit, the crafts and industries, the law and government, the
mathematics and medicine, the enemas and drainage systems, the geometry
and astronomy, the calen- dar and clock and zodiac, the alphabet and
writing, the paper and ink, the books and libraries and schools, the
literature and music, the sculpture and architecture, the glazed pottery
and fine furniture, the monotheism and monogamy, the cosmetics and
jewelry, the checkers and dice, the ten-pins and income-tax, the
wet-nurses and beer, from which our own European and American culture
derive by a continuous succession through the medi- ation of Crete and
Greece and Rome. The “Aryans” did not establish</p>
<p>civilization — they took it from Babylonia and Egypt. Greece did not
begin civilization — it inherited far more civilization than it began;
it was the spoiled heir of three millenniums of arts and sciences
brought to its cities from the Near East by the fortunes of trade and
war. In studying and honoring the Near East we shall be acknowledging a
debt long due to the real founders of European and American
civilization.</p>

<p>The culture of Susa — The potter’s wheel— The wagon-wheel</p>
<p>If the reader will look at a map of Persia, and will run his finger
north along the Tigris from the Persian Gulf to Amara, and then east
across the Iraq border to the modem town of Shushan, he will have
located the site of the ancient city of Susa, center of a region known
to the Jews as Elam — the high land. In this narrow territory, protected
on the west by marshes, and on the east by the mountains that shoulder
the great Iranian Plateau, a people of unknown race and origin developed
one of the first historic civilizations. Here, a generation ago, French
archeologists found human remains dating back 20,000 years, and
evidences of an advanced culture as old as 4500 b.c.* 1</p>
<p>Apparently the Elamites had recently emerged from a nomad life of
hunting and fishing; but already they had copper weapons and tools, cul-
tivated grains and domesticated animals, hieroglyphic writing and
business documents, mirrors and jewelry, and a trade that reached from
Egypt to India. 3 In the midst of chipped flints that bring us back to
the Neolithic Age we find finished vases elegantly rounded and
delicately painted with geometric designs, or with picturesque
representations of animals and plants; some of this pottery is ranked
among the finest ever made by man.* Here is the oldest appearance not
only of the potter’s wheel but of the wagon wheel; this modest but vital
vehicle of civilization is found only later in Babylonia, and still
later in Egypt.’ From these already complex beginnings the Elamites rose
to troubled power, conquering Sumeria and Babylon, and being conquered
by them, turn by turn. The city of Susa survived six thousand years of
history, lived through the imperial zeniths of Sumeria, Babylonia,
Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece and Rome, and flourished, under the name
of Shushan, as late as the fourteenth century of our era. At various
times it grew to great wealth; when</p>
<p>Ashurbanipal captured and sacked it (646 b.c.) his historians
recounted without understatement the varied booty of gold and silver,
precious stones and royal ornaments, costly garments and regal
furniture, cosmetics and chariots, which the conqueror brought in his
train to Nineveh. His- tory so soon began its tragic alternance of art
and war.</p>
<p>•Professor Breasted believes that the antiquity of this culture, and
that of Anau, h as been exaggerated by De Morgan, Pumpelly and other
students.*</p>

<p>The exhuming of Sumeria — Geography — Race — Appearance —</p>
<p>The Sumerian Flood — The kings — An ancient reformer —</p>
<p>— Sargon of Akkad — The Golden Age of Ur</p>
<p>If we return to our map and follow the combined Tigris and Euphrates
from the Persian Gulf to where these historic streams diverge (at mod-
em Kuma), and then follow the Euphrates westward, we shall find, north
and south of it, the buried cities of ancient Sumeria: Eridu (now Abu
Shahrein), Ur (now Mukayyar), Uruk (Biblical Erech, now Warka),</p>
<p>Larsa (Biblical Ellasar, now Senkereh), Lagash (now Shippurla),
Nippur (Niffer) and Nisin. Follow the Euphrates northwest to Babylon,
once the most famous city of Mesopotamia (the land “between the
rivers”); ob - serve, directly east of it, Kish, site of the oldest
culture known in this region; then pass some sixty miles farther up the
Euphrates to Agade, cap- ital, in ancient days, of the Kingdom of Akkad.
The early history of</p>
<p>Mesopotamia is in one aspect the struggle of the non-Semitic peoples
of Sumeria to preserve their independence against the expansion and
inroads of the Semites from Kish and Agade and other centers in the
north. In the midst of their struggles these varied stocks
unconsciously, perhaps unwillingly, cooperated to produce the first
extensive civilization known to history, and one of the most creative
and unique.*</p>
<p>Despite much research we cannot tell of what race the Sumerians were,
iior by what route they entered Sumeria. Perhaps they came from
central</p>
<p>•The unearthing of this forgotten culture is one of the romances of
archeology. To those whom, with a poor sense of the amplitude of time,
we call “the ancients”— that is, to the Romans, the Greeks and the Jews
— Sumeria was unknown. Herodotus apparendy never heard of it; if he did,
he ignored it, as something more ancient to him than he to us. Berosus,
a Babylonian historian writing about 2jo b.c., knew of Sumeria only
through the veil of a legend. He described a race of monsters, led by
one Oannes, coming out of the Persian Gulf, and introducing the arts of
agriculture, metal- working, and writing; “all the things that make for
the amelioration of life,” he declares, “were bequeathed to men by
Oannes, and since that time no further inventions have been made.” 6 Not
till two thousand years after Berosus was Sumeria rediscovered. In i8jo
Hincks recognized that cuneiform writing — made by pressing a
wedge-pointed stylus upon soft clay, and used in the Semitic languages
of the Near East — had been borrowed from an earlier people with a
largely non-Semitic speech; and Oppert gave to this hypothetical people
the name</p>

<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>“9</p>
<p>Asia, or the Caucasus, or Armenia, and moved through northern Mesopo-
tamia down the Euphrates and the Tigris — along which, as at Ashur,
evidences of their earliest culture have been found; perhaps, as the
legend says, they sailed in from the Persian Gulf, from Egypt or
elsewhere, and slowly made their way up the great rivers; perhaps they
came from Susa, among whose relics is an asphalt head bearing all the
characteristics of the Sumerian type; perhaps, even, they were of remote
Mongolian origin, for there is much in their language that resembles the
Mongol speech. 9 We do not know.</p>
<p>The remains show them as a short and stocky people, with high,
straight, non-Semitic nose, slightly receding forehead and
downward-sloping eyes. Many wore beards, some were clean-shaven, most
of. them shaved the upper lip. They clothed themselves in fleece and
finely woven wool; the women draped the garment from the left shoulder,
the men bound it at the waist and left the upper half of the body bare.
Later the male dress crept up towards the neck with the advance of
civilization, but servants, male and female, while indoors, continued to
go naked from head to waist. The head was usually covered with a cap,
and the feet were shod with sandals; but well-to-do women had shoes of
soft leather, heel-less, and laced like our own. Bracelets, necklaces,
anklets, finger-rings and ear-rings made the women of Sumeria, as
recently in America, show- windows of their husbands’ pros - perity.
10</p>
<p>When their civilization was already old — about 2300 b.c. — the poets
and scholars of Sumeria tried to reconstruct its ancient history. The
poets wrote legends of a creation, a primitive Paradise and a terrible
flood that engulfed and destroyed it because of the sin of an ancient
king. 11 This flood passed down into Babylonian and Hebrew tradition,
and became part of the Chris- tian creed. In 1929 Professor Woolley,
digging into the ruins of Ur, dis- covered, at considerable depth, an
eight-foot layer of silt and clay; this, if we are to believe him, was
deposited during a catastrophic overflow of the</p>
<p>“Sumerian.” 7 About the same time Rawlinson and his aides found,
among Babylonian ruins, tablets containing vocabularies of this ancient
tongue, with interlinear translations, in modem college style, from the
older language into Babylonian. 8 In 1854 two Englishmen uncovered the
sites of Ur, Eridu and Uruk; at the end of the nineteenth century French
explorers revealed the remains of Lagash, including tablets recording
the history of the Sumerian kings; and in our own time Professor Woolley
of the University of Pennsyl- vania, and many others, have exhumed the
primeval city of Ur, where the Sumerians appear to have reached
civilization by 4500 b.c. So the students of many nations have worked
together on this chapter of that endless mystery story in which the
detectives are archeologists and the prey is historic truth.
Nevertheless, there has been as yet only a beginning of research in
Sumeria; there is no telling what vistas of civilization and history
will be opened up when the ground has been worked, and the material
studied, as men have worked and studied in Egypt during the last one
hundred years.</p>
<p>120 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. VII</p>
<p>Euphrates, which lingered in later memory as the Flood. Beneath that
layer were the remains of a prediluvian culture that would later be
pictured by the poets as a Golden Age.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the priest-historians sought to create a past spacious
enough for the development of all the marvels of Sumerian civilization.
They formu- lated lists of their ancient kings, extending the dynasties
before the Flood to 432,000 years; 12 and told such impressive stories
of two of these rulers, Tammuz and Gilgamesh, that the latter became the
hero of the greatest poem in Babylonian literature, and Tammuz passed
down into the pantheon of Babylon and became the Adonis of the Greeks.
Perhaps the priests ex- aggerated a little the antiquity of their
civilization. We may vaguely judge the age of Sumerian culture by
observing that the ruins of Nippur are found to a depth of sixty-six
feet, of which almost as many feet extend below the remains of Sargon of
Akkad as rise above it to the topmost stratum (ca. 1 a. d.); 13 on this
basis Nippur would go back to 5262 b. c. Ten- acious dynasties of
city-kings seem to have flourished at Kish ca. 4500 b. c., and at Ur ca.
3500 b. c. In the competition of these two primeval centers we have the
first form of that opposition between Semite and non-Semite which was to
be one bloody theme of Near-Eastern history from the Semitic ascendancy
of Kish and the conquests of the Semitic kings Sargon I and Hammurabi,
through the capture of Babylon by the “Aryan” general s Cyrus and
Alexander in the sixth and fourth centuries before Christ, and the
conflicts of Crusaders and Saracens for the Holy Sepulchre and the
emolu- ments of trade, down to the efforts of the British Government to
dominate and pacify the divided Semites of the Near East today.</p>
<p>From 3000 b.c. onward the clay-tablet records kept by the priests,
and found in the ruins of Ur, present a reasonably accurate account of
the ac- cessions and coronations, uninterrupted victories and sublime
deaths of the petty kings who ruled the city-states of Ur, Lagash, Uruk,
and the rest; the writing of history and the partiality of historians
are very ancient things. One king, Urukagina of Lagash, was a royal
reformer, an enlightened despot who issued decrees aimed at the
exploitation of the poor by the rich, and of everybody by the priests.
The high priest, says one edict, must no longer “come into the garden of
a poor mother and take wood there - from, nor gather tax in fruit
therefrom”; burial -fees were to be cut to one-fifth of what they had
been; and the clergy and high officials were forbidden to share among
themselves the revenues and cattle offered to the gods. It was the
King’s boast that he “gave liberty to his people”; 14</p>

<p>CHAP, vn)</p>
<p>and surely the tablets that preserve his decrees reveal to us the
oldest, briefest and justest code of laws in history.</p>
<p>This lucid interval was ended normally by one Lugal-zaggisi, who</p>
<p>invaded Lagash, overthrew Urukagina, and sacked the city at the
height of its prosperity. The temples were destroyed, the citizens were
mas- sacred in the streets, and the statues of the gods were led away in
ignomin- ious bondage. One of the earliest poems in existence is a clay
tablet, apparently 4800 years old, on which the Sumerian poet
Dingiraddamu mourns for the raped goddess of Lagash:</p>
<p>For the city, alas, the treasures, my soul doth sigh,</p>
<p>For my city Girsu (Lagash), alas, the treasures, my soul doth
sigh.</p>
<p>In holy Girsu the children are in distress.</p>
<p>Into the interior of the splendid shrine he (the invader)
pressed;</p>
<p>The august Queen from her temple he brought forth.</p>
<p>O Lady of my city, desolated, when wilt thou return? 1 *</p>
<p>We pass by the bloody Lugal-zaggisi, and other Sumerian kings of</p>
<p>mighty name: Lugal-shagengur, Lugal-kigub-nidudu, Ninigi-dubti,
Lugal- andanukhunga…. Meanwhile another people, of Semitic race, had
built the kingdom of Akkad under the leadership of Sargon I, and had
estab- lished its capital at Agade some two hundred miles northwest of
the Sumerian city-states. A monolith found at Susa portrays Sargon armed
with the dignity of a majestic beard, and dressed in all the pride of
long authority. His origin was not royal: history could find no father
for him, and no other mother than a temple prostitute. 10 Sumerian
legend composed for him an autobiography quite Mosaic in its beginning:
“My humble mother conceived me; in secret she brought me forth. She
placed me in a basket-boat of rushes; with pitch she closed my d oor.”
17 Rescued by a workman, he became a cup-bearer to the king, grew in
favor and influence, rebelled, displaced his master, and mounted the
throne of Agade. He called himself “King of Universal Dominion,” and
ruled a small portion of Mesopotamia. H istorians call him “the Great,”
for he invaded many cities, captured much booty, and killed many men.
Among his victims was that same Lugal-zaggisi who had despoiled Lagash
and violated its goddess; him Sargon defeated and carried off to Nippur
in chains. East and west, north and south the mighty warrior marched,
conquering Elam, washing his weapons in symbolic triumph in the Persian
Gulf, crossing</p>
<p>122 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. VII</p>
<p>western Asia, reaching the Mediterranean, 18 and establishing the
first great empire in history. For fifty-five years he held sway, while
legends gath- ered about him and prepared to make him a god. His reign
closed with all his empire in revolt.</p>
<p>Three sons succeeded him in turn. The third, Naram-sin, was a mighty
builder, of whose works nothing remains but a lovely stele, or memorial
slab, recording his victory over an obscure king. This powerful relief,
found by De Morgan at Susa in 1897, and now a treasure of the Louvre,
shows a muscular Naram-sin armed with bow and dart, stepping with royal
dignity upon the bodies of his fallen foes, and apparently prepared to
answer with quick death the appeal of the vanquished for mercy; while
between them another victim, pierced through the neck with an arrow,
falls dying. Behind them tower the Zagros Mountains; and on one hill is
the record, in elegant cuneiform, of Naram- sin’s victory. Here the art
of carving is already adult and confident, already guided and
strengthened with a long tradition.</p>
<p>To be burned to the ground is not always a lasting misfortune for
a</p>
<p>city; it is usually an advantage from the standpoint of architecture
and sanitation. By the twenty-sixth century b.c. we find Lagash
flourishing again, now under another enlightened monarch, Gudea, whose
stocky statues are the most prominent remains of Sumerian sculpture. The
diorite figure in the Louvre shows him in a pious posture, with his head
crossed by a heavy band resembling a model of the Colosseum, hands
folded in his lap, bare shoulders and feet, and short, chubby legs
covered by a bell- like skirt embroidered with a volume of
hieroglyphics. The strong but regular features reveal a man thoughtful
and just, firm and yet refined. Gudea was honored by his people not as a
warrior but as a Sumerian Aurelius, devoted to religion, literature and
good works; he built temples, promoted the study of classical
antiquities in the spirit of.the expeditions that unearthed him, and
tempered the strength of the strong in mercy to the weak. One of his
inscriptions reveals the policy for which his people worshiped him,
after his death, as a god: “During seven years the maid - servant was
the equal of her mistress, the slave walked beside his master, and in my
town the weak rested by the side of the strong.” 10</p>
<p>Meanwhile “Ur of the Chaldees” was having one of the most pros -</p>
<p>perous epochs in its long career from 3,500 b.c. (the apparent age of
its oldest graves) to 700 b.c. Its greatest king, Ur-engur, brought
all</p>
<p>SUMERIA</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>western Asia under his pacific sway, and proclaimed for all Sumeria
the first extensive code of laws in history. “By the laws of
righteousness of Shamash forever I established justice.” 20 As Ur grew
rich by the trade that</p>
<p>But soon that glory faded. The warlike Elamites from the East and</p>
<p>he rising Amorites from the West swept down upon the leisure, pros-
perity and peace of Ur, captured its king, and sacked the city with
primi- tive thoroughness. The poets of Ur sang sad chants about the rape
of the statue of Ishtar, their beloved mother-goddess, torn from her
shrine by profane invaders. The form of these poems is unexpectedly
first- personal, and the style does not please the sophisticated ear;
but across the four thousand years that separate us from the Sumerian
singer we feel the desolation of his city and his people.</p>
<p>Me the foe hath ravished, yea, with hands unwashed;</p>
<p>Me his hands have ravished, made me die of terror.</p>
<p>Oh, I am wretched! Naught of reverence hath he!</p>
<p>Stripped me of my robes, and clothed therein his consort.</p>
<p>Tore my jewels from me, therewith decked his daughter.</p>
<p>(Now) I tread his courts — my very person sought he</p>
<p>In the shrines. Alas, the day when to go forth I trembled.</p>
<p>He pursued me in my temple; he made me quake with fear,</p>
<p>There within my walls; and like a dove that fluttering percheth</p>
<p>On a rafter, like a flitting owlet in a cavern hidden,</p>
<p>Birdlike from my shrine he chased me,</p>
<p>From my city like a bird he chased me, me sighing,</p>
<p>“Far behind, behind me is my temple.” 2 *</p>
<p>So for two hundred years, which to our self-centered eyes seem but an
empty moment, Elam and Amor ruled Sumeria. Then from the north came the
great Hammurabi, King of Babylon; retook from the Elamites Uruk and
Isin; bided his time for twenty-three years; invaded Elam and captured
its king; established his sway over Amor and distant Assyria, built an
empire of unprecedented power, and disciplined it with a universal</p>
<p>124 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VII</p>

<p>But Sumerian civilization remained. Sumer and Akkad still produced
handicraftsmen, poets, artists, sages and saints; the culture of the
southern cities passed north along the Euphrates and the Tigris to
Babylonia and Assyria as the initial heritage of Mesopotamian
civilization.</p>
<p>At the basis of this culture was a soil made fertile by the annual
over- flow of rivers swollen with the winter rains. The overflow was
perilous as well as useful; the Sumerians learned to channel it safely
through irri- gating canals that ribbed and crossed their land; and they
commemorated those early dangers by legends that told of a flood, and
how at last the land had been separated from the waters, and mankind had
been saved. 2 * This irrigation system, dating from 4000 b.c., was one
of the great achieve- ments of Sumerian civilization, and certainly its
foundation. Out of these carefully watered fields came abounding crops
of corn, barley, spelt, dates, and many vegetables. The plough appeared
early, drawn by oxen as even with us until yesterday, and already
furnished with a tubular seed- drill. The gathered harvest was threshed
by drawing over it great sledges of wood armed with flint teeth that cut
the straw for the cattle and</p>
<p>released the grain for men. 24</p>
<p>It was in many ways a primitive culture. The Sumerians made some</p>
<p>use of copper and tin, and occasionally mixed them to produce bronze;
now and then they went so far as to make large implements of iron. 25
But metal was still a luxury and a rarity. Most Sumerian tools were of
flint; some, like the sickles for cutting the barley, were of clay; and
cer- tain finer articles, such as needles and awls, used ivory and bone.
25 Weav- ing was done on a large scale under the supervision of
overseers appointed by the king, 21 after the latest fashion of
governmentally controlled industry. Houses were made of reeds, usually
plastered with an adobe mixture of clay and straw moistened with water
and hardened by the sun; such dwell- ings are still easy to find in what
was once Sumeria. The hut had wooden doors, revolving upon socket hinges
of stone. The floors were ordinarily</p>
<p>SUMERIA</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>he beaten earth; the roofs were arched by bending the reeds together
at the top, or were made flat with mud-covered reeds stretched over
crossbeams of wood. Cows, sheep, goats and pigs roamed about the
dwelling in primeval comradeship with man. Water for drinking was drawn
from wells. 28</p>
<p>Goods were carried chiefly by water. Since stone was rare in Sumeria
it was brought up the Gulf or down the rivers, and then through numerous
canals to the quays of the cities. But land transportation was
developing; at Kish the Oxford Field Expedition unearthed some of the
oldest wheeled vehicles known. 20 Here and there in the ruins are
business seals bearing indications of traffic with Egypt and India.”
There was no coinage yet, and trade was normally by barter; but gold and
silver were already in use as standards of value, and were often
accepted in exchange for goods — sometimes in the form of ingots and
rings of definite worth, but generally in quantities measured by weight
in each transaction. Many of the clay tablets that have brought down to
us fragments of Sumerian writing are business documents, revealing a
busy commercial life. One tablet speaks, with fin-de- siecle weariness,
of “the city, where the tumult of man is.” Contracts had to be confirmed
in writing and duly witnessed. A system of credit existed by which
goods, gold or silver might be borrowed, interest to be paid in the same
material as the loan, and at rates ranging from 15 to 33% per annum. 31
Since the stability of a society may be partly mea- sured by inverse
relation with the rate of interest, we may suspect that Sumerian
business, like ours, lived in an atmosphere of economic and po- litical
uncertainty and doubt.</p>
<p>Gold and silver have been found abundantly in the tombs, not only</p>
<p>as jewelry, but as vessels, weapons, ornaments, even as tools. Rich
and poor were stratified into many classes and gradations; slavery was
highly developed, and property rights were already sacred.” Between the
rich and the poor a middle class took form, composed of small-business
men, scholars, physicians and priests. Medicine flourished, and had a
specific for every disease; but it was still bound up with theology, and
admitted that sickness, being due to possession by evil spirits, could
never be cured without the exorcising of these demons. A calendar of
uncertain age and origin divided the year into lunar months, adding a
month every three or four years to reconcile the calendar with the
seasons and the sun. Each city gave its own names to the months.”</p>

<li>Government</li>

<p>The kings — Ways of war — The feudal barons — Law</p>
<p>Indeed each city, as long as it could, maintained a jealous
independence, and indulged itself in a private Icing. It called him
patesi, or priest-king, indicating by the very word that government was
bound up with religion. By 2800 b.c. the growth of trade made such
municipal separatism im- possible, and generated “empires” in which some
dominating personality subjected the cities and their patesis to his
power, and wove them into an economic and political unity. The despot
lived in a Renaissance atmos- phere of violence and fear; at any moment
he might be despatched by the same methods that had secured him the
throne. He dwelt in an in- accessible palace, whose two entrances were
so narrow as to admit only one person at a time; to the right and left
were recesses from which secret guards could examine every visitor, or
pounce upon him with daggers. 3 * Even the king’s temple w as private,
hidden away in his palace, so that he might perform his religious duties
without exposure, or neglect them inconspicuously.</p>
<p>The king went to battle in a chariot, leading a motley host armed
with bows, arrows and spears. The wars were waged frankly for commercial
routes and goods, without catchwords as a sop for idealists. King
Manish- tusu of Akkad announced frankly that he was invading Elam to get
control of its silver mines, and to secure diorite stone to immortalize
himself with statuary — the only instance known of a war fought for the
sake of art. The defeated were customarily sold into slavery; or, if
this was unprofit- able, they were slaughtered on the battlefield.
Sometimes a tenth of the prisoners, struggling vainly in a net, were
offered as living victims to the thirsty gods. As in Renaissance Italy,
the chauvinistic separatism of the cities stimulated life and art, but
led to civic violence and suicidal strife that weakened each petty
state, and at last destroyed Sumeria. 33</p>
<p>In the empires social order was maintained through a feudal system.
After a successful war the ruler gave tracts of land to his valiant
chieftains, and exempted such estates from taxation; these men kept
order in their territories, and provided soldiers and supplies for the
exploits of the king. The finances of the government were obtained by
taxes in kind, stored in royal warehouses, and distributed as pay to
officials and employees of the state. 30</p>
<p>SUMERIA</p>

<p>127</p>
<p>To this system of royal and feudal administration was added a body of
law, already rich with precedents when Ur-engur and Dungi codified the
statutes of Ur; this was the fountainhead of Hammurabi’s famous code. It
was cruder and simpler than later legislation, but less severe: where,
for example, the Semitic code killed a woman for adultery, the Sumerian
code merely allowed the husband to take a second wife, and reduce the
first to a subordinate position.” The law covered commercial as well as
sexual relations, and regulated all loans and contracts, all buying and
selling, all adoptions and bequests. Courts of justice sat in the
temples, and the judges were for the most part priests; professional
judges presided over a superior court. The best element in this code was
a plan for avoiding litigation: every case was first submitted to a
public arbitrator whose duty it was to bring about an amicable
settlement without recourse to law.” It is a poor civilization from
which we may not learn something to improve our own.</p>

<p>King Ur-engur proclaimed his code of laws in the name of the

<p>god Shamash, for government had so soon discovered the political
utility of heaven. Having been found useful, the gods became
innumerable; every city and state, every human activity, had some
inspiring and dis- ciplinary divinity. Sun-worship, doubtless already
old when Sumeria be- gan, expressed itself in the cult of Shamash,
“light of the gods,” who passed the night in the depths of the north,
until Dawn opened its gates for him; then he mounted the sky like a
flame, driving his chariot over the steeps of the firmament; the sun was
merely a wheel of his fiery car.”</p>

<p>crescent about his head, presaging the halos of medieval saints. The
air was full of spirits — beneficent angels, one each as protector to
every Sumerian, and demons or devils who sought to expel the protective
deity and take possession of body and soul.</p>
<p>Most of the gods lived in the temples, where they were provided by
the faithful with revenue, food and wives. The tablets of Gudea list the
objects which the gods preferred: oxen, goats, sheep, doves, chickens,
ducks, fish, dates, figs, cucumbers, butter, oil and cakes ; 41 we may
judge from this fist that the well-to-do Sumerian enjoyed a plentiful
cuisine. Originally, it seems, the gods preferred human flesh; but as
human morality improved they had to be content with animals. A
liturgical tablet found in the Sumerian ruins says, with strange
theological pr emonitions: “The laijib is the substitute for humanity;
he hath given up a lamb for his life.”“ Enriched by such beneficence,
the priests became the wealthiest and most powerful class in the
Sumerian cities. In most matters they were the gov- ernment; it is
difficult to make out to what extent the patesi was a priest, and to
what extent a king. Urukagina rose like a Luther against the ex- actions
of the clergy, denounced them for their voracity, accused them of taking
bribes in their administration of the law, and charged that they were
levying such taxes upon farmers and fishermen as to rob them of the
fruits of their toil. He swept the courts clear for a time of these
corrupt officials, and established laws regulating the taxes and fees
paid to the temples, protecting the helpless against extortion, and
providing against the violent alienation of funds or property.“ Already
the world was old, and well established in its time-honored ways.</p>
<p>Presumably the priests recovered their power when Urukagina died,
quite as they were to recover their power in Egypt after the passing of
Ikhnaton; men will pay any price for mythology. Even in this early age
the great myths of religion were taking form. Since food and tools were
placed in the graves with the dead, we may presume that the Sumerians
believed in an after-life. 44 But like the Greeks they pictured the
other world as a dark abode of miserable shadows, to which all the dead
descended indiscriminately. They had not yet conceived heaven and hell,
eternal reward and punishment; they offered prayer and sacrifice not for
“eternal</p>
<p>SUMERIA</p>
<p>12 9</p>

<p>deathless life.“ Another legend narrated how the gods had created man
happy; how man, by his free will, had sinned, and been punished with a
flood, from which but one man — Tagtug the weaver — had survived. Tag-
tug forfeited longevity and health by eating the fruit of a forbidden
tree.“</p>
<p>The priests transmitted education as well as mythology, and doubtless
sought to teach, as well as to rule, by their myths. To most of the
temples were attached schools wherein the clergy instructed boys and
girls in writing and arithmetic, formed their habits into patriotism and
piety, and prepared some of them for the high professsion of scribe.
School tablets survive, encrusted with tables of multiplication and
division, square and cube roots, and exercises in applied geometry.“
That the instruction was not much more foolish than that which is given
to our children appears from a tablet which is a Lucretian outline of
anthropol ogy: “Mankind when created did not know of bread for eating or
garments for wearing. The people walked with limbs on the ground, they
ate herbs with their mouths like sheep, they drank ditch- water.”“</p>
<p>What nobility of spirit and utterance this first of the historic
religions could rise to shines out in the prayer of King Gudea to the
goddess Bau, the patron deity of Lagash:</p>
<p>0 my Queen, the Mother who established Lagash,</p>
<p>The people on whom thou lookest is rich in power;</p>
<p>The worshiper on whom thou lookest, his life is prolonged.</p>
<p>1 have no mother — thou art my mother;</p>
<p>I have no father — thou art my father….</p>
<p>My goddess Bau, thou knowest what is good;</p>
<p>Thou hast given me the breath of life.</p>
<p>Under the protection of thee, my Mother,</p>
<p>In thy shadow I will reverently dwell. 60</p>
<p>Women were attached to every temple, some as domestics, some as
concubines for the gods or their duly constituted representatives on
earth. To serve the temples in this way did not seem any disgrace to a
Sumerian girl; her father was proud to devote her charms to the
alleviation of divine monotony, and celebrated the admission of his
daughter to these sacred functions with ceremonial sacrifice, and the
presentation of the girl’s marriage dowry to the temple. 61</p>
<p>Marriage was already a complex institution regulated by many
laws.</p>
<p>130 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>The bride kept control of the dowry given her by her father in
marriage, and though she held it jointly with her husband, she alone
determined its bequest. She exercised equal rights with her husband over
their children; and in the absence of the husband and a grown-up son she
administered the estate as well as the home. She could engage in
business independently of her husband, and could keep or dispose of her
own slaves. Sometimes, like Shub-ad, she could rise to the status of
queen, and rule her city with luxurious and imperious grace.’ 2 But in
all crises the man was lord and master. Under certain conditions he
could sell his wife, or hand her over as a slave to pay his debts. The
double standard was already in force, as a corollary of property and
inheritance: adultery in the man was a for- givable whim, but in the
woman it was punished with death. She was expected to give many children
to her husband and the state; if barren, she could be divorced without
further reason; if merely averse to con- tinuous maternity she was
drowned. Children were without legal rights; their parents, by the act
of publicly disowning them, secured their banish- ment from the
city.“</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as in most civilizations, the women of the upper
classes almost balanced, by their luxury and their privileges, the toil
and dis- abilities of their poorer sisters. Cosmetics and jewelry are
prominent in the Sumerian tombs. In Queen Shub- ad’s grave Professor
Woolley picked up a little compact of blue-green malachite, golden pins
with knobs of lapis-lazuli, and a vanity-case of filigree gold shell.
This vanity-case, as large as a little finger, contained a tiny spoon,
presumably for scooping up rouge from the compact; a metal stick,
perhaps for training the cuticle; and a pair of tweezers probably used
to train the eyebrows or to pluck out inopportune hairs. The Queen’s
rings were made of gold wire ; one ring was inset with segments of
lapis-lazuli; her necklace was of fluted lapis and gold. Surely there is
nothing new under the sun; and the differ- ence between the first woman
and the last could pass through the eye of a needle.</p>

<p>merce, poetry and religion. The oldest inscriptions are on stone, and
date apparently as far back as 3600 b.c.“ Towards 3200 b.c. the clay</p>
<p>ablet appears, and from that time on the Sumerians seem to have
delighted in the great discovery. It is our good fortune that the people
of Mesopo- tamia wrote not upon fragile, ephemeral paper in fading ink,
but upon moist clay deftly impressed with the wedge- like (“cuneiform”)
point</p>
<p>of a stylus. With this malleable material the scribe kept records,
executed contracts, drew up official documents, recorded property,
judgments and sales, and created a culture in which the stylus became as
mighty as the sword. Having completed the writing, the scribe baked the
clay tablet with heat or in the sun, and made it thereby a manuscript
far more durable than paper, and only less lasting than stone. This
development of cunei- form script was the outstanding contribution of
Sumeria to the civilizing of mankind.</p>
<p>Sumerian writing reads from right to left; the Babylonians were, so
far as we know, the first people to write from left to right. The linear
script, as we have seen, was apparently a stylized and conventionalized
form of the signs and pictures painted or impressed upon primitive
Sumerian pot- tery.* Presumably from repetition and haste over centuries
of time, the original pictures were gradually contracted into signs so
unlike the objects which they had once represented that they became the
symbols of sounds rather than of things. We should have an analogous
process in English if the picture of a bee should in time be shortened
and simplified, and come to mean not a bee but the sound be, and then
serve to indicate that syllable in any combination as in be-ing. The
Sumerians and Babylonians never ad- vanced from such representation of
syllables to the representation of letters — never dropped the vowel in
the syllabic sign to make be mean b; it seems to have remained for the
Egyptians to take this simple but revolu tionary step.“</p>
<p>The transition from writing to literature probably required many hun-
dreds of years. For centuries writing was a tool of commerce, a matter
of contracts and bills, of shipments and receipts; and secondarily,
perhaps, it was an instrument of religious record, an attempt to
preserve magic formulas, ceremonial procedures, sacred legends, prayers
and hymns from alteration or decay. Nevertheless, by 2700 b.c., great
libraries had been formed in Sumeria; at Tello, for example, in ruins
contemporary with Gudea, De Sarzac discovered a collection of over
30,000 tablets ranged one</p>
<p>Cf. above, p. 104.</p>
<p>132 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>upon another in neat and logical array As early as 2000 B.c. Sumerian
historians began to reconstruct the past and record the present for the
edification of the future; portions of their work have come down to us
not in the original form but as quotations in later Babylonian
chronicles. Among the original fragments, however, is a tablet found at
Nippur, bear- ing the Sumerian prototype of the epic of Gilgamesh, which
we shall study later in its developed Babylonian expression. 1 “ Some of
the shattered tablets contain dirges of no mean power, and of
significant literary form. Here at the outset appears the characteristic
Near-Eastern trick of chant- ing repetition — many lines beginning in
the same way, many clauses reiter- ating or illustrating the meaning of
the clause before. Through these sal- vaged relics we see the religious
origin of literature in the songs and lamen- tations of the priests. The
first poems were not madrigals, but prayers.</p>
<p>Behind these apparent beginnings of culture were doubtless many cen-
turies of development, in Sumeria and other lands. Nothing has been
created, it has only grown. Just as in writing Sumeria seems to have
created cuneiform, so in architecture it seems to have created at once
the fundamental shapes of home and temple, column and vault and arch. 68
The Sumerian peasant made his cottage by planting reeds in a square, a
rectangle or a circle, bending the tops together, and binding them to
form an arch, a vault or a dome; 60 this, we surmise, is the simple
origin, or earliest known appearance, of these architectural forms.
Among the ruins of Nippur is an arched drain 5000 years old; in the
royal tombs of Ur there are arches that go back to 3500 b.c., and arched
doors were common at Ur 2000 b.c. 00 And these were true arches: i.e.,
their stones were set in full voussoir fashion — each stone a wedge
tapering downward tightly into place.</p>
<p>The richer citizens built palaces, perched on a mound sometimes forty
feet above the plain, and made purposely inaccessible except by one
path, so that every Sumerian’s home might be his castle. Since stone was
scarce, these palaces were mostly of brick. The plain red surface of the
walls was relieved by terracotta decoration in every form — spirals,
chevrons, triangles, even lozenges and diapers. The inner walls were
plastered and painted in simple mural style. The house was built around
a central court, which gave shade and some coolness against the
Mediterranean sun; for the same reason, as well as for security, the
rooms opened upon this court rather than upon the outer world. Windows
were a luxury, or perhaps they were not wanted.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>SUMERIA</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Water was drawn from wells; and an extensive system of drainage drew
the waste from the residential districts of the towns. Furniture was not
complex or abundant but neither was it without taste. Some beds were in-
laid with metal or ivory, and occasionally, as in Egypt, armchairs
flaunted feet like lions’ claws. 61</p>
<p>For the temples stone was imported, and adorned with copper entabla-
tures and friezes inlaid with semiprecious material. The temple of
Nannar at Ur set a fashion for all Mesopotamia with pale blue enameled
tiles; while its interior was paneled with rare woods like cedar and
cypress, inlaid with marble, alabaster, onyx, agate and gold. Usually
the most important temple in the city was not only built upon an
elevation, but was topped with a zig- gurat — a tower of three, four or
seven stories, surrounded with a winding external stairway, and set back
at every stage. Here on the heights the loftiest of the city’s gods
might dwell, and here the government might find a last spiritual and
physical citadel against invasion or revolt.* 62</p>
<p>The temples were sometimes decorated with statuary of animals, heroes
and gods; figures plain, blunt and powerful, but severely lacking in
sculp- tural finish and grace. Most of the extant statues are of King
Gudea, exe- cuted resolutely but crudely in resistant diorite. In the
ruins of Tell-el- Ubaid, from the early Sumerian period, a copper
statuette of a bull was found, much abused by the centuries, but still
full of life and bovine com- placency. A cow’s head in silver from the
grave of Queen Shub -ad at Ur is a masterpiece that suggests a developed
art too much despoiled by time to permit of our giving it its due. This
is almost proved by the</p>
<p>bas- reliefs that survive. The “Stele of the Vultures” set up by King
Ean - natum of Lagash, the porphyry cylinder of Ibnishar , 63 the
humorous cari- catures (as surely they must be) of Ur- nina , 04 and
above all the “Victory Stele” of Naram-sin share the crudity of Sumerian
sculpture, but have in them a lusty vitality of drawing and action
characteristic of a young and flourishing art.</p>
<p>Of the pottery one may not speak so leniently. Perhaps time misleads
our judgment by having preserved the worst; perhaps there were many
pieces as well carved as the alabaster vessels discovered at Eridu ; 05
but for the most part Sumerian pottery, though turned on the wheel, is
mere earthenware, and cannot compare with the vases of Elam. Better work
was done by the goldsmiths. Vessels of gold, tasteful in design and
delicate in finish, have</p>

The silver vase of Entemenu, now in the Louvre, is as stocky as Gudea,
but is adorned with a wealth of animal imagery finely engraved.“ Best of
all is the gold sheath and lapis-lazuli dagger exhumed at Ur; 88 here,
if one may judge from photographs,* the form almost touches perfection.
The ruins have given us a great number of cylindrical seals, mostly made
of precious metal or stone, with reliefs carefully carved upon a square
inch or two of surface; these seem to have served the Sumerians in place
of signatures, and indicate a refinement of life and manners disturbing
to our naive conception of progress as a continuous rise of man through
the unfortunate cultures of the past to the unrivaled zenith of
today.</p>
<p>Sumerian civilization may be summed up in this contrast between crude
pottery and consummate jewelry; it was a synthesis of rough beginnings
and occasional but brilliant mastery. Here, within the limits of our
present knowledge, are the first states and empires, the first
irrigation, the first use of gold and silver as standards of value, the
first business contracts, the first credit system, the first code of
law, the first extensive development of writing, the first stories of
the Creation and the Flood, the first libraries and schools, the first
literature and poetry, the first cosmetics and jewelry, the first
sculpture and bas-relief, the first palaces and temples, the first
ornamental metal and decorative themes, the first arch, column, vault
and dome. Here, for the first known time on a large scale, appear some
of the sins of civilization: slavery, despotism, ecclesiasticism, and
imperialistic war. It was a life differentiated and subtle, abundant and
complex.</p>
<p>Already the natural inequality of men was producing a new degree of
comfort and luxury for the strong, and a new routine of hard and dis-
ciplined labor for the rest. The theme was struck on which history would
strum its myriad variations.</p>

<p>East. The oldest written records known to us are Sumerian; this,
which may be a whim of circumstance, a sport of mortality, does not
prove that the first civilization was Sumerian. Statuettes and other
remains akin to those of Sumeria have been found at Ashur and Samarra,
in what became Assyria; we do not know whether this early culture came
from Sumeria or passed to it along the Tigris. The code of Hammurabi
resembles that of Ur-engur and Dungi, but we cannot be sure that it was
evolved from it rather than from some predecessor ancestral to them
both. It is only probable, not certain, that the civilizations of
Babylonia and Assyria were derived from or fer- tilized by that of Sumer
and Akkad. 09 The gods and myths of Babylon and Nineveh are in many
cases modifications or developments of Sumerian the- ology; and the
languages of these later cultures bear the same relationship to Sumeria
that French and Italian bear to Latin.</p>
<p>Schweinfurth has called attention to the interesting fact that though
the cultivation of barley, millet and wheat, and the domestication of
cattle, goats and sheep, appear in both Egypt and Mesopotamia as far
back as our rec- ords go, these cereals and animals are found in their
wild and natural state not in Egypt but in western Asia — especially in
Yemen or ancient Arabia. He concludes that civilization — i.e., in this
context, the cultivation of cereals and the use of domesticated animals
— appeared in unrecorded antiquity in Arabia, and spread thence in a
“triangular culture” to Mesopotamia (Sumeria, Babylonia, Assyria) and
Egypt. 70 Current knowledge of primitive Arabia is too slight to make
this more than a presentable hypothesis.</p>
<p>More definite is the derivation of certain specific elements of
Egyptian culture from Sumeria and Babylonia. We know that trade passed
between Mesopotamia and Egypt — certainly via the isthmus at Suez, and
probably by water from the ancient outlets of Egyptian rivers on the Red
Sea. 71 A look at the map explains why Egypt, throughout its known
history, has be- longed to Western Asia rather than to Africa; trade and
culture could pass from Asia along the Mediterranean to the Nile, but
shortly beyond that it was balked by the desert which, with the
cataracts of the Nile, isolated Egypt from the remainder of Africa.
Hence it is natural that we should find many Mesopotamian elements in
the primitive culture of Egypt.</p>
<p>The farther back we trace the Egyptian language the more affinities
it reveals with the Semitic tongues of the Near East. 72 The
pictographic writ- ing of the predynastic Egyptians seems to have come
in from Sumeria. 73 The cylindrical seal, which is of unquestionably
Mesopotamian origin, ap- pears in the earliest period of known Egyptian
history, and then disappears, as if an imported custom had been
displaced by a native mode. 74 The potter’s wheel is not known in Egypt

was apparently developed in western Asia, and brought thence to Egypt.
78 Early Egyptian architecture resembles Mesopotamian in the use of the
recessed panel as a decoration for brick walls. 79 Predynastic pottery,
statuettes and decorative motives are in many cases identical, or
unmistakably allied, with Mesopo- tamian products. 80 Among these early
Egyptian remains are small figures of a goddess of evident Asiatic
origin. At a time when Egyptian civilization seems to have only begun,
the artists of Ur were making statuary and reliefs whose style and
conventions demonstrate the antiquity of these arts in Sumeria. 81 *</p>
<p>Egypt could well afford to concede the priority of Sumeria. For what-
ever the Nile may have borrowed from the Tigris and the Euphrates, it
soon flowered into a civilization specifically and uniquely its own; one
of the richest and greatest, one of the most powerful and yet one of the
most graceful, cultures in history. By its side Sumeria was but a crude
beginning; and not even Greece or Rome would surpass it.</p>

<li>A great scholar, Elliot Smith, has tried to offset these
considerations by pointing out that although barley, millet and wheat
are not known in their natural state in Egypt, it is there that we find
the oldest signs of their cultivation; and he believes that it was from
Egypt that agriculture and civilization came to Sumeria. 82 The greatest
of American Egyptologists, Professor Breasted, is similarly unconvinced
of the priority of Sumeria. Dr. Breasted believes that the wheel is at
least as old in Egypt as in Sumeria, and rejects the hypothesis of
Schweinfurth on the ground that cereals have been found in their native
state in the highlands of Abyssinia.</li>
