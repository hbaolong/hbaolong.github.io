<h4 id="chapter-xxxi">CHAPTER XXXI</h4>
<p>Suleiman the Magnificent</p>
<p>1520-66</p>
<p>I. AFRICAN ISLAM: 1 200-1 6</p>
<p>I T is hard for us, pigeonholed in Christendom, to realize that from
the eighth to the thirteenth century Islam was culturally, politically,
and militarily superior to Europe. Even in its decline in the sixteenth
century it prevailed from Delhi and beyond to Casablanca, from
Adrianople to Aden, from Tunis to Timbuktu. Visiting the Sudan in 1353,
Ibn-Batuta found there a creditable civilization under Moslem
leadership; and a Negro Moham- medan, Abd-er-Rahman Sa’di, would later
write a revealing and intelligent history, T arik-es-Sudan ( c . 1650),
describing private libraries of 1,600 vol- umes in Timbuktu, and massive
mosques whose ruins attest a departed glory.</p>
<p>The Marini dynasty (1195-1270) made Morocco independent, and de-
veloped Fez and Marraqesh into major cities, each with august gateways,
imposing mosques, learned libraries, colleges squatting amid shady
colon- nades, and wordy bazarres where one could buy anything at half
the price. In the thirteenth century Fez had some 125,000 inhabitants,
probably more than any city in Europe except Constantinople, Rome, and
Paris. In its Karouine Mosque, seat of Morocco’s oldest university,
religion and science lived in concord, taking eager students from all
African Islam, and — in ardu- ous courses of three to twelve years —
training teachers, lawyers, theologians, and statesmen. Emir Yaqub II
(r. 1269-86), ruling Morocco from Fez or Marraqesh, was one of the most
enlightened princes of a progressive century, a just governor, a wise
philanthropist, tempering theology with philosophy, shunning bigotry,
and encouraging friendly intercourse with Europeans. The two cities
received many refugees from Spain, and these brought a new stimulus to
science, art, and industry. Ibn-Batuta, who had seen nearly all of vast
Islam, called Morocco the earthly paradise.</p>
<p>On the way from Fez to Oran the modern traveler is surprised to find
at Tlemcen the modest remnant of what in the thirteenth century was a
city of 125 ,000 souls Three of its once sixty-four mosques — the
Jama-el-Kebir (1136), the mosque of Abul Hassan (1298), and that of
El-Halawi ( 1 353) — are among the finest in the Mohammedan world;
marble columns, complex mosaics, brilliant mihrabs, arcaded courts,
carved wood, and towering mina-</p>
<p>695</p>
<p>696 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>rets survive to tell of a splendor gone and almost forgotten. Here
the Abd-el- Wahid dynasty (1248 — 1337, 1359-1553) maintained for three
centuries a relatively enlightened rule, protecting Christians and Jews
in religious free- dom, and providing patronage to letters and arts.
After the Turks captured the city (1553) it lost its importance as a
center of trade, and declined into the shadows of history.</p>
<p>Farther east, Algiers flourished through a mixture of commerce and
piracy. Half-hidden in a rock-bound semicircular bay, this picturesque
port, rising in tier upon tier of white tenements and palaces from the
Mediterranean to the Casbah, provided a favorite lair for “privateers”;
even from Pompey’s days the corsairs of that coast had preyed upon
defenseless shipping. After 1492 Algiers became a refuge for Moors
fleeing from Spain; many of them joined the pirate crews, and turned
with vengeful fury upon what Christian shipping they could waylay.
Growing in number and audacity, the pirates manned fleets as strong as
national navies, and raided the North Mediter- ranean coasts. Spain
retaliated with protective expeditions that captured Oran, Algiers, and
Tripoli ( 1 509-10) .</p>
<p>In 1516 a colorful buccaneer entered the picture. The Italians called
him Barbarossa from his red beard; his actual name was Khair ed-Din
Khizr; he was a Greek of Lesbos, who came with his brother Horush to
join the pirate crew. While Khair ed-Din raised himself to command of
the fleet, Horush led ’an army against Algiers, expelled the Spanish
garrison, made himself governor of the city, and died in battle (1518).
Khair ed-Din, succeeding to his brother’s pow er, ruled with energy and
skill. To consolidate his position he went to Constantinople, and
offered Selim I sovereignty over Tripoli, Tunisia, and Algeria in return
for a Turkish force adequate to maintain his own authority as vassal
governor of these regions. Selim agreed, and Sulei- man confirmed the
arrangement. In 1533 Khair ed-Din became the hero of Western Islam by
ferrying 70,000 Moors from inhospitable Spain to Africa. Appointed first
admiral of the entire Turkish fleet, Barbarossa, with eighty- four
vessels at his command, raided town after town on the coasts of Sicily
and Italy, and took thousands of Christians to be sold as slaves.
Landing near Naples, he almost succeeded in capturing Giulia Gonzaga
Colonna, reputed the loveliest woman in Italy. She escaped half clad,
rode off with one knight as her escort, and, on reaching her
destination, ordered his death for reasons which she left to be
inferred.</p>
<p>But Barbarossa aimed at less perishable booty than a beautiful woman.
Landing his Janissaries at Bizerte, he marched against Tunis (1534). The
Nefsid dynasty had ruled that city reasonably well since 1336; arts and
let- ters had flourished under their patronage; but Muley Hassan, the
current prince, had alienated the people by his cruelties. He fled as
Barbarossa ap-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXl) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 697</p>
<p>proached; Tunis was taken bloodlessly; Tunisia was added to the
Ottoman realm, and Barbarossa was master of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It was another crisis for Christendom, for the unchallenged Turkish
fleet could at any moment secure a foothold for Islam in the Italian
boot. Strangely enough, Francis I was at this time allied with the
Turks, and Pope Clement VII was allied with France. Fortunately, Clement
died (September 25,</p>
<ol start="1534" type="1">
<li>; Pope Paul III pledged funds to Charles V for an attack on
Barbarossa, and Andrea Doria offered the full co-operation of the
Genoese fleet. In the spring of 1535 Charles assembled at Cagliari, in
Sardinia, 400 vessels and 30,000 troops. Crossing the Mediterranean, he
laid siege to La Goletta, a fort commanding the Gulf of Tunis. After a
month’s fighting, La Goletta fell, and the Imperial army marched on to
Tunis. Barbarossa tried to stop the advance; he was defeated and fled.
Christian slaves in Tunis broke their chains and opened the gates, and
Charles entered the city unresisted. For two days he surrendered it to
pillage by his soldiers, who would otherwise have mutinied; thousands of
Moslems were massacred; the art of centuries was shattered in a day or
two. The Christian slaves were joyously freed, and the surviving
Mohammedan population was enslaved. Charles reinstated Muley Hassan as
his tributary vassal, left garrisons in Bona and La Goletta, and
returned to Europe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Barbarossa escaped to Constantinople, and there, with Suleiman’s
funds, built a new fleet of 200 ships. In July 1537, this force effected
a landing at Taranto, and Christendom was again besieged. A new “Holy
League” of V enice, the papacy, and the Empire took form, and gathered
200 vessels off Corfu. On September 27 the rival armadas, at the
entrance to the Ambracian Gulf, fought an engagement almost in the same
waters where Antony and Cleopatra had met Octavian at Actium. Barbarossa
won, and again ruled the seas. Sailing east, he took one after another
of the Venetian possessions in the Aegean and Greece, and forced Venice
to a separate peace.</p>
<p>Charles tried to win Barbarossa to his service by gifts and an offer
to make him vassal king of North Africa, but Khair ed-Din preferred
Islamic bait. In October 1541, Charles and Doria led an expedition
against Algiers; it was defeated on land by Barbarossa’s army, and at
sea by a storm. Barbarossa returned the call by ravaging Calabria and
landing, unhindered, at Ostia, the port of Rome. The great capital
shivered in its shrines, but Paul III was at that time on good terms
with Francis, and Barbarossa, allegedly out of courtesy to his ally,
paid in cash for all that he took at Ostia, and departed peacefully. 1
He sailed up to Toulon, where his fleet was welcomed by tht
matter-of-fact F rench; he asked that the church bells should suspend
their ringing while Allah’s vessels were in the harbor, for the bells
disturbed his sleep, and his request was law. He joined a French fleet
in taking Nice and</p>

<p>Bona, La Goletta, and Tripoli fell back to Islam, and the Ottoman
Empire reached from Algiers to Baghdad. Only one Moslem power dared to
chal- lenge its predominance in Islam.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SAFAVID PERSIA: 1502-76</li>
</ol>
<p>Persia, which had enjoyed so many periods of cultural fertility, was
now entering another epoch of political vitality and artistic creation.
When Shah Ismail I founded the Safavid dynasty (1502-1736) Persia was a
chaos of kinglets: Iraq, Yazd, Samnan, Firuzkuh, Diyarbekir, Kashan,
Khurasan, Qandahar, Balkh, Kirman, and Azerbaijan were independent
states. In a suc- cession of ruthless campaigns Ismail of Azerbaijan
conquered most of these principalities, captured Herat and Baghdad, and
made Tabriz again the cap- ital of a powerful kingdom. The people
welcomed this native dynasty, gloried in the unity and power it gave
their country, and expressed their spirit in a new outburst of Persian
art.</p>
<p>Ismail’s rise to royalty is an incredible tale. He was t hree years
old when his father died ( 1490), thirteen when.he set out to win
himself a throne, still thirteen when he had himself crowned Shah of
Persia. Contemporaries de- scribed him as “brave like a young gamecock”
and “lively as a faun,” stout, broad-shouldered, with furious mustaches
and flaming red hair; he wielded a mighty sword with his left hand, and
with the bow he was another Odys- seus, shooting down seven apples in a
row of ten. 2 We are told that he was “amiable as a girl,” but he kille
d his own mother (or stepmother), ordered the execution of 300
courtesans at Tabriz, and massacred thousands of ene- mies. 8 He was so
popular that “the name of God is forgotten” in Persia, said an Italian
traveler, “and only that of Ismail is remembered.” 4</p>
<p>Religion and audacity were the secrets of his success. Religion in
Persia was Shi‘a— i.e., “the party” of Ali, son -in- law of Mohammed.
The Shi‘a recognized no rightful caliphs but Ali and his twelve lineal
descendants — “imams” or holy kings; and since religion and government
were not distinct in Islam, each such descendant had, in this doctrine,
a divine right to rule both church and state. As Christians believed
that Christ would return to establish His kingdom on earth, so the
Shi’ites believed that the twelfth imam — Muhammad ibn-Hasan — had never
died, but would someday reappear and set up his blessed rule over the
earth. And as Protestants condemned Catholics for accepting tradition,
along with the Bible, as a guide to right be- lief, so the Shi’ites
denounced the Sunnites — the orthodox Mohammedan majority — who found
the surma or “path” of righteousness not only in the</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXl) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 699</p>
<p>Koran but also in the practice of Mohammed as handed down in the
traditions of his companions and followers. And as Protestants gave up
pray- ing to the saints and closed the monasteries, so the Shi‘ites
discountenanced the Sufi mystics and closed the cloisters of the
dervishes, which, like the monasteries of Europe in their prime, had
been centers of hospitality and charity. As Protestants called their
faith the “true religion,” so the Shi’ites took the name al-Ma- minum,
“true believers.” 5 No faithful Shi‘ite would eat with a Sunnite; and if
a Christian’s shadow passed over a Shi’ite’s meal, the food was to be
discarded as unclean. 6</p>
<p>Ismail claimed descent from the seventh imam, Safi-al- Din (“Purity
of the Faith”), from whom the new dynasty was named. By proclaiming
Shi‘a as the national and official religion of Iran, and as the sacred
standard under which he fought, Ismail united his people in pious
devotion against the Sun- nite Moslems who hemmed Persia in — the Uzbeks
and Afghans on the east, the Arabs, Turks, and Egyptians on the west.
His strategy succeeded; de- spite his cruelties he was worshiped as a
saint, and his subjects so trusted in his divine power to protect them
that some refused to wear armor in battle. 7</p>
<p>Having won this fervent support, Ismail felt strong enough to
challenge his neighbors. The Uzbeks who ruled Transoxiana had spread
their power into Khurasan; Ismail took Herat from them, and drove them
out of Persia. Secure in the east, he turned west against the Ottomans.
Each faith now persecuted the other with holy intensity. Sultan Selim,
we are unreliably told, had 40,000 Shi’ites in his dominions killed or
imprisoned before going forth to war (1514), and Shah Ismail hanged some
of the Sunnites who formed a majority in Tabriz, and compelled the rest
to utter daily a prayer cursing the first three caliphs as usurpers of
Ali’s rights. Nevertheless, in battle at Chaldiran, the Persians found
Shi‘a helpless before the artiller y and Janissaries of Selim the Grim;
the Sultan took Tabriz, and subdued all north- ern Mesopotamia (1516).
But his army mutinied, he retreated, and Ismail returned to his capital
with all the glory that shrouds a martial king. Letters declined during
his hectic reign, but art prospered under his patronage; he protected
the painter Bihzad, and rated him as worth half of Persia. 8 After
twenty-four years of rule Ismail died at thirty-eight, leaving the
throne to his ten-year-old son (1524).</p>
<p>Shah Tamasp I was a faithless coward, a melancholy sybarite, an
incom- petent king, a harsh judge, a patron and practitioner of art, a
pious Shi’ite, and the idol of his people. Perhaps he had some secret
virtues which he hid from history. The continuing emphasis on religion
disturbed as well as strengthened the government, for it sanctioned a
dozen wars, and kept the Islam of the Near and Middle East divided from
1508 to 1638. Christendom benefited, for Suleiman interrupted his
assaults upon the West by campaigns against Persia; “only the Persian
stands between us and ruin,” wrote Ferdi -</p>
<p>700</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>nand’s ambassador in Constantinople. 9 In 1533 the Grand Vizier
Ibrahim Pasha led a Turkish army into Azerbaijan, took fortress after
fortress by bribing Persian generals, and finally captured Tabriz and
Baghdad without striking a blow (1534) . Fourteen years later, during an
armistice with Ferdi- nand, Suleiman led another army against “the
rascally Red - heads” (the Turkish name for the Persians), took
thirty-one towns, and then resumed his attacks upon Christendom. Between
1525 and 1545 Charles repeatedly negotiated with Persia, presumably to
co-ordinate Christian and Persian resistance to Suleiman. The West
rejoiced when Persia assumed the offen- sive and captured Erzerum; but
in 1 554 Suleiman returned, devastated great stretches of Persia, and
forced Tamasp to a peace in which Baghdad and Lower Mesopotamia fell
permanently under Turkish rule.</p>
<p>More interesting than these dismal conflicts were the venturesome
jour- neys that Anthony Jenkinson made into Transoxiana and Persia in
search of an overland trade route to India and “Cathay.” In this matter
Ivan the Terri - ble proved amiable; he welcomed Jenkinson in Moscow,
sent him as his ambassador to the Uzbek rulers at Bokhara, and agreed to
let English goods enter Russia duty free and pass down the Volga and
across the Caspian. After surviving a violent storm on that sea,
Jenkinson continued into Persia and reached Qasvin (1561). There he
delivered to Tamasp letters of salutation from a distant queen who
seemed to the Persians a minor ruler over a bar- barous people. They
were inclined to sign a trade agreement, but when Jenkinson confessed
himself a Christian they bade him depart; “we have no need of friendship
with infidels,” they told him; and as he left the Shah a servant spread
purifying sand to cover the Christian footprints that had polluted the
Shi‘a court. 10</p>
<p>The death of Tamasp (1576) concluded the longest but one of all
Moham- medan reigns, and one of the most disastrous. It was not
distinguished by any literature lovingly cherished in Persian memory,
unless we include the fasci- nating memoirs of the expatriated Babur.
But Safavid art, though its zenith would come later, already in these
two reigns began to pour forth works of that grandeur, brilliance, and
refinement which for twenty-two centuries have marked the products of
Persia, hi Isfahan the mausoleum of Harun-i- Vilaya displayed all the
finesse of classic Persian design, and the best color and cutting of
mosaic faience; and a complex half-dome crowned the portal of the great
Friday Mosque. Another Masjid-i-Jami rose in this age at Shiraz, but
time has swallowed it.</p>
<p>In many instances the delicate work of the illuminators and
calligraphers has outlasted the architectural monuments, and has
justified the care that made the book, in Islam, almost an idol of
loving reverence. The Arabs, proud of everything, were forgivably
enamored of their alphabet, which lent itself to lines of sinuous grace.
The Persians above all made that script</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXl) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 701</p>
<p>an art in adorning the mihrabs and portals of their mosques, the
metal of their weapons, the clay of their pottery, the texture of their
rugs, and in transmitting their Scriptures and their poets in
manuscripts that many genera- tions would cherish as delights to eye and
soul. The Nastaliq or sloping script, which had flourished under the
Timurids at Tabriz, Herat, and Samarkand, returned to Tabriz under the
Safavids, and went with them to Isfahan. As the mosque brought together
a dozen arts, so the book employed poet, cal- ligrapher, miniaturist,
and binder into a collaboration quite as dedicated and devout.</p>
<p>The art of illumination continued to flourish at Bokhara, Herat,
Shiraz, and Tabriz. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has a lordly
manuscript of Firdausi’s Shah -mum signed by Arraji Muhammad al-Qawam of
Shiraz ( 1552); the Cleveland Museum has another illuminated by
Mushid-al-Kiatib (1538); and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
has one of the finest examples of Tabriz illumination and calligraphy in
the title page from a copy (1525) of Nizami’s Khamsu. The center of
Mohammedan illumina - tion moved to Tabriz when Bihzad chose it for his
residence ( c . 1510). Dur- ing the campaign of Chaldiran Shah Ismail
hid Bihzad and the calligrapher Mahmud Nishapuri in a cave as his most
precious possessions. 11 Bihzad’s pupil Aqa Mirak painted at Tabriz one
of the master miniatures of this period, the Khosru and Shirin Enthroned
(1539), now in the British Museum. Mirak in turn taught the art to
Sultan (Prince) Muhammad Nur. Bom of a rich family, Muhammad ignored the
fact that he had the means to be worthless; he became the “pearl without
price” at the court of Shah Tamasp, for he sur - passed all his
contemporaries in calligraphy and illumination, and in designing book
covers and rugs. Between 1539 and 1543 he copied and illustrated the
Khamsu of Nizami; a magnificent page in the British Museum shows King
Khosru, mounted on a pink horse, peering through foliage of green,
brown, and gold at Shirin bathing, half naked, in a silver pool. Even
more brilliant in color is a painting of the Prophet riding through the
skies on his winged horse Buraq to visit heaven and hell. The figures
are grace incarnate, but deliberately and religiously without
individualized features; the artist was in- terested in decoration
rather than representation, and valued beauty, which, subjective, is
sometimes attainable, more than truth, which, objective, al- ways
escapes. In these miniatures Persian illumination reached the apex of
its elegance.</p>
<p>The same loving care and delicate designs went into textiles and
rugs. No textiles survive from these reigns, but the miniatures picture
them. In rugs the Safavi designers and artisans were supreme. The carpet
seemed an essential of civilization in Islam. The Moslem sat and ate not
on chairs but on a floor or ground covered with a rug. A special “prayer
rug,” usually bearing religious symbols and a Koranic text, received his
prostrations in</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>702</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>his devotions. Rugs were favored as gifts to friends or kings or
mosques; so Shah Tamasp sent twenty large and many small carpets of silk
and gold to Selim II on the latter’s accession as Ottoman Sultan (1566).
Some dom - inating feature of design classified the rugs as of the
garden, floral, hunting, vase, diaper, or medallion type; but around
these basic forms were meander- ing arabesques, Chinese cloud
configurations, symbols conveying secret meanings to the initiate,
animals lending the pattern life, plants and flowers giving it a kind of
linear fragrance and joyful tone; and through the complex whole an
artistic logic ran, a contrapuntal harmony of lines more intricate than
Palestrina’s madrigals, more graceful than Godiva’s hair.</p>
<p>Some famous Persian rugs survive from this first half of the

<li>SULEIMAN AND THE WEST</li>
</ol>
<p>Suleiman succeeded his father Selim I in 1520 at the age of
twenty-six. He had won a name for himself by his courage in war, his
generosity in friendship, and his efficient administration of Turkish
provinces. His re- fined features and gracious manners made him welcome
in a Constantinople tired of Selim the Grim. An Italian who saw Suleiman
soon after his ac- cession described him as tall, wiry, and strong, the
neck too long, the nose too curved, beard and mustache thin, complexion
sallow and delicate, coun- tenance grave and calm; he looked more like a
student than a sultan. 18 Eight years later another Italian reported him
as “deadly pale . . . melancholy, much addicted to women, liberal,
proud, hasty, and yet sometimes very gentle.” Ghislain de Busbeq,
ambassador of the Hapsburgs at the Porte, wrote almost fondly of the
Hapsburcrs’ most persistent enemy:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 703</p>
<p>He has always had the character of being a careful and temperate</p>
<p>man; even in his early days, when, according to the Turkish rule,</p>
<p>sin would have been venial, his life was blameless, for not even
in</p>
<p>youth did he indulge in wine or commit those unnatural crimes</p>
<p>which are common among the Turks; nor could those who were</p>
<p>disposed to put the most unfavorable construction on his acts bring
anything worse against him than his excessive devotion to his wife.</p>
<p>… It is a well-known fact that from the time he made her his
lawful</p>
<p>wife he has been perfectly faithful to her, although there was
nothing in the laws to prevent his having mistresses as well. 14</p>
<p>It is a picture worth noting, but too flattering: Suleiman was
doubtless the greatest and noblest of the Ottoman sultans, and equaled
any ruler of his time in ability, wisdom, and character; but we shall
find him, now and then, guilty of cruelty, jealousy, and revenge. Let
us, however, as an experiment in perspective, try to view
dispassionately his conflict with Christendom.</p>
<p>The military debate between Christianity and Islam was already 900
years old. It began when Moslem Arabs snatched Syria from the Byzantine
Empire (634). It proceeded through the year-by-year conquest of that
Empire by the Saracens, and the conquest of Spain by the Moors.
Christen- dom retaliated in the Crusades, in which both sides covered
with religious phrases and ardor their economic aims and political
crimes. Islam retaliated by taking Constantinople and the Balkans. Spain
expelled the Moors. Pope after pope called for fresh crusades against
the Turks; Selim I vowed to build a mosque in Rome; Francis I proposed
to the Western powers (1516) that they should utterly destroy the
Turkish state and divide its possessions among themselves as infidel
spoils. 15 This plan was frustrated by the division of Ger- many in
religious war r the revolt of the Spanish communes against Charles V,
and the second thought of Francis himself — to seek Suleiman’s aid
against Charles. Suleiman may have been saved by Luther, as Lutheranism
owed so much to Suleiman.</p>
<p>Every government strives to extend its borders, partly to enlarge its
re- sources and revenues, partly to create additional protective terrain
between its frontiers and its capital. Suleiman supposed that the best
defense was of- fense. In 1521 he captured the Hungarian strongholds of
Szabacs and Bel- grade; then, feeling safe in the West, he turned his
forces against Rhodes. There the Christians, under the Knights of
St. John, held a heavily fortified citadel directly athwart the routes
from Constantinople to Alexandria and Syria; it seemed to Suleiman a
dangerous alien bastion in an otherwise Turk- ish sea; and in fact the
pirate ships of the Knights preyed upon Moslem commerce 16 in one end of
the Mediterranean as the Moslem pirates of Algeria preyed upon Christian
commerce in the other. When Moslems were taken in these Knightly raids
they were usually slain. 17 Vessels carrying</p>
<p>704 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>pilgrims to Mecca were intercepted on suspicion of hostile purposes.
“Under all the circumstances,” says a Christian historian, “Suleiman was
in no need of justification for an assault on Rhodes”; 18 and a
distinguished English historian adds: “It was i n the interest of public
order that the island should be annexed to the Turkish realm.” 19</p>
<p>Suleiman attacked with 300 ships and 200,000 men. The defenders, led
by the aged Grand Master Philippe de Villiers de L’ile -Adam, fought the
besiegers for 145 days, and finally surrendered under honorable terms:
the Knights and their soldiery were to leave the island in safety, but
within ten days; the remaining population were to have full religious
freedom, and were to be exempt from tribute for five years. On Christmas
Day Suleiman asked to see the Grand Master; he condoled with him,
praised his brave defense, and gave him valuable presents; and to the
Vizier Ibrahim the Sultan re- marked that “it caused him great sorrow to
be obliged to force this Chris - tian in his old age to abandon his home
and his belongings.” 20 On January 1, 1523, the Knights sailed off to
Crete, whence, eight years later, they passed to a more permanent home
in Malta. The Sultan tarnished his victory by putting to death the son
and grandchildren of Prince Djem because they had become Christians and
might be used, as Djem had been, as claimants to the Ottoman throne.</p>
<p>Early in 1525 Suleiman received a letter from Francis I, then a
captive of Charles V, asking him to attack Hungary and come to the
rescue of the French King. The Sultan answered: “Our horse is saddled,
our sword is girt on.” 21 However, he had long ago made up his mind to
invade Hungary. He set out in April 1526, with 100,000 men and 300
cannon. Pope Clement VII urged Christian rulers to go to the aid of the
threatened state; Luther advised the Protestant princes to stay home,
for the Turks were obviously a divine visitation, and to resist them
would be to resist God. 22 Charles V remained in Spain. The consequent
rout of the Hungarians at Mohacs was a moral as well as a physical
defeat for Christendom. Hungary might have recovered from the disaster
if Catholics and Protestants, Emperor and Pope, had labored together;
but Lutheran leaders rejoiced in the Turkish victory, and the army of
the Emperor sacked Rome.</p>
<p>In 1529 Suleiman returned, and besieged Vienna with 200,000 men; from
the spire of St. Stephen’s, Count Nicholas von Salm, to whom Ferdinand
entrusted the defense, could see the surrounding plains and hills
darkened with the tents, soldiery, and armament of the Ottomans. This
time Luther summoned his adherents to join in the resistance, for
clearly, if Vienna fell, Germany would be the next object of Turkish
attack. Reports ran through Europe that Suleiman had vowed to reduce all
Europe to the one true faith — Islam. 28 Turkish sappers dug tunnel
after tunnel in the hope of blowing up the walls or setting up
explosions within the city, but the defenders placed</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 705</p>
<p>vessels of water at danger points, and watched for movements that
would indicate subterranean operations. Winter came, and the Sultan’s
long line of communications failed to maintain supplies. On October 14
he called for a final and decisive effort, and promised great rewards;
spirit and flesh were both unwilling; the attack was repulsed with great
loss, and Suleiman sadly ordered a retreat. It was his first defeat; yet
he retained half of Hun- gary, and carried back to Constantinople the
royal crown of St. Stephen. He explained to his people that he returned
without victory because Fer- dinand (who had sat the siege out safely in
Prague) had refused to fight; and he promised that he would soon hunt
out Charles himself, who dared to call himself emperor, and would wrest
from him the lordship of the West.</p>
<p>The West took him seriously enough. Rome fell into a panic; Clement
VII, for once resolute, taxed even the cardinals to raise funds to
fortify Ancona and other ports through which the Ottomans might enter
Italy. In April 1532, Suleiman marched westward once more. His departure
from his capital was a well staged spectacle: 120 cannon led the
advance; 8,000 Janissaries followed, the best soldiers in the realm; a
thousand camels carried provisions; 2,000 elite horsemen guarded the
holy standard — the eagle of the Prophet; thousands of Christian captive
boys, dressed in cloth of gold and plumed red hats, flaunted lances with
innocent braver y; the Sultan’s own retinue were men of giant stature
and handsome mien; among them, on a chestnut horse, rode Suleiman
himself, robed in crimson velvet embroidered with gold, under a white
turban inset with precious stones; and behind him marched an army that
in its final mustering numbered 200,000 men. Who could resist such
splendor and power? Only the elements and space.</p>
<p>To meet this avalanche Charles, after much pleading, received from
the Imperial Diet a grant to raise 40,000 foot and 8,000 horse; he and
Ferdinand provided 30,000 additional men at their own expense; and with
these 78,000, gathered in Vienna, they awaited siege. But the Sultan was
delayed at Guns. It was a small town, well fortified, but garrisoned
with only 700 troops. For three weeks they fought back every Turkish
attempt to break through the walls; eleven times these were pierced,
eleven times the defenders blocked the opening with metal, flesh, and
desperation. At last Suleiman sent a safe- conduct and hostages to the
commander, Nicholas Jurischitz, inviting him to a conference. He came,
and was received with honors by the Grand Vizier; his courage and
generalship were sorrowfully praised; the Sultan presented him with a
robe of honor, guaranteed him against further attack, and sent him back
to his citadel under a handsome escort of Turkish officers, The
invincible avalanche, defeated by 700 men, passed on to Vienna.</p>
<p>But there too Suleiman missed his prey. Charles would not come out to
fight; he would have been foolish to forfeit the advantage of his
defenses for the gamble of the open field. Suleiman reckoned that if he
had failed to take</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>706</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Vienna held by 20,000 men with no emperor or king in sight, he would
hardly do better against 78,000 inspired by a young monarch who had
publicly announced that he would welcome death in this contest as the
noblest worldly end to which a Christian could aspire. The Sultan turned
away, ravaged Styria and Lower Austria, and took stray captives to grace
his retreat. It could have been no comfort to him to hear that while he
was marching uselessly back and forth across Hungary Andrea Doria had
chased the Turkish fleet into hiding, and had captured Patras and Coron,
on the Peloponnesian coast.</p>
<p>When Ferdinand sent an emissary to Constantinople to seek peace
Sulei- man welcomed him; he would grant peace “not for seven years, not
for twenty-five years, not for a hundred years, but for two centuries,
three centuries, indeed forever — if Ferdinand himself would not break
it,” and he would treat Ferdinand as a son. 24 However, he asked a heavy
price: Ferdi- nand must send him the keys to the city of Grau in token
of submission and homage. Ferdinand and Charles were so eager to free
their arms against Christians that they were ready to make concessions
to the Turks. Ferdinand sent the keys, called himself Suleiman’s son,
and acknowledged Suleiman’s sovereignty over most of Hungary (June 22,
1533). No peace was made with Charles. Suleiman recaptured Patras and
Coron, and dreamed of strad- dling Vienna and Tabriz.</p>
<p>He took Tabriz, and turned west again (1536). Putting theology aside,
he agreed to co-operate with Francis I in another campaign against
Charles. He offered the most amiable terms to the King: peace should be
made with Charles only on his surrendering Genoa, Milan, and Flanders to
France; French merchants were permitted to sail, buy, and sell
throughout the Otto- man Empire on equal terms with the Turks; French
consuls in that realm were to have civil and criminal jurisdiction over
all Frenchmen there, and these were to enjoy full religious liberty. 25
The “capitulations” so signed became a model for later treaties of
Christian powers with Eastern states.</p>
<p>Charles countered by forming an alliance of the Empire, Venice, and
the papacy. Ferdinand joined in; so short was forever. Venice bore the
brunt of the Turkish attack, lost her possessions in the Aegean and on
the Dalmatian coast, and signed a separate peace ( 1 540) . A year later
Suleiman’s puppet in Buda died, and the Sultan made Hungary an Ottoman
province. Ferdinand sent an envoy to Turkey to ask for peace, and
another to Persia urging the Shah to attack the Turks. Suleiman marched
west (1543), took Grau and Stuhlweissenburg, and incorporated more of
Hungary into the pashalik of Buda. In 1547, busy with Persia, he granted
the West a five-year armistice. Both sides violated it. Pope Paul IV
appealed to the Turks to at- tack Philip II, who was more papal than the
popes. 26 The death of Francis and Charles left Ferdinand a freer hand
to come to terms. In the Peace of</p>

<p>Prague (1562) he acknowledged Suleiman’s rule in Hungary and
Moldavia, pledged a yearly tribute of 30,000 ducats, and agreed to pay
90,000 ducats as arrears.</p>
<p>Two years later he followed his brother. Suleiman had survived all
his major enemies, and how many popes had he not outlived? He was master
of Egypt, North Africa, Asia Minor, Palestine, Syria, the Balkans,
Hungary. The Turkish navy ruled the Mediterranean, the Turkish army had
proved its prowess east and west, the Turkish government had shown
itself as competent in statesmanship and diplomacy as all its rivals.
The Christians had lost Rhodes, the Aegean, Hungary, and had signed a
humiliating peace. The Ottomans were now the strongest power in Europe
and Africa, if not in the world.</p>

<p>Were they civilized? Of course; the notion that the Turks were
barbarians as compared with the Christians is a self-propping delusion.
Their agricul- tural methods and science were at least as good as those
of the West. The land was tilled by tenants of feudal chieftains who in
each generation had to earn their holdings by serving the sultan
satisfactorily in administration and war. Except in textiles, ceramics,
and perhaps in arms and armor, in- dustry had not yet developed a
factory system as in Florence or Flanders, but Turkish craftsmen were
famous for their excellent products, and the absence of capitalism was
not mourned by rich or poor. The merchants had not reached in
sixteenth-century Islam the political influence or social posi- tion
then accorded to them in Western Europe. Trade between Turk and Turk was
noted for its relative honesty, but between Turk and Christian no holds
were barred. Foreign commerce was mostly left to foreigners. Moslem
caravans moved patiently over the ancient and medieval land routes into
Asia and Africa, even across the Sahara; and caravansaries, many of them
set up by Suleiman, offered the merchant and traveler resting places on
the way. Moslem vessels, till 1 500, controlled the sea routes from Con-
stantinople and Alexandria through the Red Sea to India and the East
Indies, where exchange was made with goods borne by Chinese junks. After
the opening of India to Portuguese merchants by the voyage of Da Gama
and the naval victories of Albuquerque, the Moslems lost control of the
Indian Ocean, and Egypt, Syria, Persia, and Venice entered into a common
com- mercial decline.</p>
<p>The Turk was a man of the earth and the sea, and gave less thought to
reli- gion than most other Mohammedans. Yet he too reverenced mystics,

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>708</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>vishes, and saints, took his law from the Koran, and his education
from the mosque. Like the Jews, he shunned graven images in his worship,
and looked upon Christians as polytheistic idolaters. Church and state
were one: the Koran and the traditions were the basic law; and the same
ulema, or associ- ation of scholars, that expounded the Holy Book also
provided the teachers, lawyers, judges, and jurists of the realm. It was
such scholars who, under Mohammed II and Suleiman I, compiled the
definitive Ottoman codes of law.</p>
<p>At the head of the ulema was the mufti or sheik ul-lslam, the highest
judge in the land after the sultan and the grand vizier. As sultans had
to die, while the ulema enjoyed a collective permanence, these
theologian-lawyers were the rulers of everyday life in Islam. Because
they interpreted the present in terms of past law, their influence was
strongly conservative, and shared in the stagnation of Moslem
civilization after Suleiman’s death. Fatalism— the Turkish qismet or lot
— furthered this conservatism: since the fate of every soul had been
predetermined by Allah, rebellion against one’s lot was im - piety and
shallowness; all things, death in particular, were in the hands of
Allah, and must be accepted without complaint. Occasionally a
freethinker spoke too frankly, and, in rare instances, was condemned to
death. Usually, however, the ulema allowed much liberty of thought, and
there was no Inquisition in Turkish Islam.</p>
<p>Christians and Jews received a large measure of religious freedom
under the Ottomans, and were permitted to rule themselves by their own
laws in matters not involving a Moslem. 27 Mohammed II deliberately
fostered the Greek Orthodox Church because the mutual distrust of Greek
and Roman Catholics served the Turks in countering crusades. Though the
Christians prospered under the sultans, they suffered serious
disabilities. Technically they were slaves, but they could end that
status by accepting Moham- medanism, and millions did. Those who
rejected Islam were excluded from the army, for Moslem wars were
ostensibly holy wars for the conversion of infidels. Such Christians
were subject to a special tax in lieu of military serv- ice; they were
usually tenant farmers, paying a tenth of their produce to the owner of
their land; and they had to surrender one infant out of every ten to be
brought up as a Moslem in the service of the sultan.</p>
<p>The sultan, the army, and the ulema were the state. At the sultan ’s
call each feudal chieftain came with his levy to form the sipahis or
cavalry, which under Suleiman reached the remarkable figure of 130,000
men. Fer- dinand’s ambassador envied the splendor of their equipment:
clothing of brocade or silk in scarlet, bright yellow, or dark blue;
harness gleaming with gold, silver, and jewelry on the finest horses
that Busbeq had ever seen. An elite infantry was formed from captive or
tributary Christian children, who were brought up to serve the sultan in
his palace, in administration, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 709</p>
<p>above all in the army, where they were called yeni chert (new
soldiers), which the West corrupted into Janissaries. Murad I had
originated this unique corps ( c . 1360), perhaps as a way of freeing
his Christian population from potentially dangerous youth. They were not
numerous — some 20,000 under Suleiman. They were highly trained in all
the skills of war, they were forbidden to marry or engage in economic
activities, they were indoctrinated with martial pride and ardor and the
Mohammedan faith, and they were as brave in war as they were restlessly
discontent in peace. Behind these super- lative soldiers came a militia
of some 100,000 men, kept in order and spirit by the sipahis and the
Janissaries. The favorite weapons were still the bow and arrow and the
lance; firearms were just coming into use; and at close quarters men
wielded the mace and the short sword. Suleiman’s army and military
science were the best in the world at that time; no other army equaled
it in handling artillery, in sapping and military engineering, in disci-
pline and morale, in care for the health of the troops, in the
provisioning of great numbers of men through great distances. However,
the means were too excellent merely to serve an end; the army became an
end in itself; to be kept in condition and restraint it had to have
wars; and after Suleiman the army — above all, the Janissaries — became
the masters of the sultans.</p>
<p>The conscripted and converted sons of Christians formed most of the
ad- ministrative staff of the central Turkish government. We should have
ex- pected that a Moslem sultan would fear to be surrounded by men who
might, like Scanderbeg, yearn for the faith of their fathers; on the
contrary, Sulei- man preferred these converts because they could be
trained from childhood for specific functions of administration. Very
likely the bureaucracy of the Ottoman state was the most efficient in
existence in the first half of the sixteenth century, 28 though it was
notoriously subject to bribery. The Diwan or Divan, like the cabinet in
a Western government, brought to- gether the heads of administration,
usually under the presidency of the grand vizier. It had advisory rather
than legislative powers, but ordinarily its rec- ommendations were made
law by a ktmun or decree of the sultan. The judiciary was manned by
qadis (judges) and mullas (superior judges) from the ulema. A French
observer remarked the diligence of the courts and the promptness of
trials and verdicts, 29 and a great English historian believed that
“under the early Ottoman rulers the administration of justice was
better</p>
<p>710 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>or the Venetians, and even Hungary thought it fared better under
Suleiman than under the Hapsburgs. 32</p>
<p>Most of the administrative offices of the central government were
located in the serai or imperial quarters — not a palace but a congeries
of buildings, gardens, and courts, housing the sultan, his seraglio, his
servants, his aides, and 80,000 of the bureaucracy. To this enclosure,
three miles in circuit, admission was by a single gate, highly
ornamented and called by the French the Sublime Porte — a. term which,
by a whimsy of speech, came to mean the Ottoman</p>
<p>One wisdom Ibrahim lacked — to conceal with external modesty his
inter- nal pride. He had many reasons to be proud: it was he who raised
the Turk- ish government to its highest efficiency, he whose diplomacy
divided the West by arranging the alliance with France, he who, while
Suleiman marched into Hungary, pacified Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt by
reforming abuses and dealing justly and affably with all. But he had
also reason to be circumspect; he was still a slave, and the higher he
raised his head the thinner grew the thread that held the royal sword
above it. He angered the army by forbidding it to sack Tabriz and
Baghdad, and trying to prevent its sack of Buda. In that pillage he
rescued part of Matthias Corvinus’s library, and three bronze statues of
Hermes, Apollo, and Artemis; these he set up before his palace in
Constantinople, and even his liberal master was disturbed by this
flouting of the Semitic commandment against graven images. Gossip
charged him with despising the Koran. Sometimes he gave entertainments
surpassing</p>
<p>SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>7 11</p>
<p>those of Suleiman in cost and magnificence. Members of the Diwan
accused him of talking as if he led the Sultan like a tamed lion on a
leash. Roxelana, favorite of the harem, resented Ibrahim’s influence,
and day by day, with feminine persistence, filled the imperial ear with
suspicions and complaints. The Sultan was finally convinced. On March
31, 1536, Ibrahim was found strangled in bed, presumably as the result
of a royal command. It was a deed whose barbarism matched the burning of
Servetus or Berquin.</p>
<p>Far more barbarous was the law of imperial fratricide. Mohammed II
had phrased it frankly in his Book of Laws: “The majority of the legists
have declared that those of my illustrious children who shall ascend the
throne shall have the right to execute their brothers, in order to
ensure the peace of the world; they are to act accordingly”; 84 that is,
the Conqueror calmly condemned to death all but the eldest born of his
royal progeny. It was an- other discredit to the Ottoman system that the
property of a person con- demned to death reverted to the sultan, who
was therefore under perpetual provocation to improve his finances by
closing his mind to an appeal; we should add that Suleiman resisted this
temptation. As against such vices of autocracy we may acknowledge in the
Ottoman government an indirect democracy: the road to every dignity but
the sultanate was open to all Mos- lems, even to all converted
Christians. However, the success of the early sultans might have argued
for the aristocratic heredity of ability, for nowhere else in
contemporary government was so high an average of ability so long
maintained as on the Turkish throne.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Morals</li>
</ol>
<p>The diversity of Ottoman from Christian ways flagrantly illustrated
the geographical and temporal variation of moral codes. Polygamy reigned
quietly where Byzantine Christianity had so recently exacted formal
monog- amy; women hid themselves in seraglios, or behind veils, where
once they had mounted the throne of the Caesars; and Suleiman attended
dutifully to the needs of his harem with none of the qualms of
conscience that might have disturbed or enhanced the sexual escapades of
Francis I, Charles V, Henry VIII, or Alexander VI. Turkish civilization,
like that of ancient</p>
<p>Greece, kept women in the background, and allowed considerable
freedom to sexual deviations. Ottoman homosexuality flourished where
“Greek friendship” had once won battles and inspired philosophers.</p>
<p>The Turks were allowed by the Koran four wives and some concubines,
but only a minority could afford the extravagance. The warring Ottomans,
often far removed from their wonted women, took as wives or concubines,
currente thalamo, the widows or daughters of the Christians they had
con-</p>
<p>712 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>quered. No racial prejudice intervened: Greek, Serbian, Bulgarian,
Alba- nian, Hungarian, German, Italian, Russian, Mongol, Persian, Arab
women were welcomed with open arms, and became the mothers of children
who were all alike accepted as legitimate and Ottoman. Adultery was
hardly necessary under the circumstances, and when it occurred it was
severely punished: the woman was obliged to buy an ass and ride it
through the city; the man was flogged with a hundred strokes, and was
required to kiss and reward the executioner who dealt them. A husband
could secure a divorce by a mere declaration of intent, but a wife could
free herself only by com- plex and deterrent litigation.</p>
<p>Suleiman remained a bachelor till his fortieth year. Since the wife
of Baja- zet I had been captured and allegedly abused by Timur and his
Tatars, the Ottoman sultans, to forestall another such indignity, had
made it a rule not to marry, and to admit none but slaves to their bed.
85 Suleiman’s seraglio contained some 300 concubines, all bought in the
market or captured in war, and nearly all of Christian origin. When they
expected a visit from the Sul- tan they attired themselves in their
finest robes, and stood in line to greet him; he saluted courteously as
many as time allowed, and placed his hand- kerchief on the shoulder of
one who especially pleased him. That evening, on retiring, he asked that
the recipient should return his handkerchief. The next morning she would
be presented with a dress of cloth of gold, and her allowance would be
increased. The sultan might remain in the harem two or three nights,
spreading his bounty; then he returned to his own palace, to live day
and night with men. Women rarely appeared in his palace, and took no
part in state dinners or ceremonies. Nevertheless it was considered a
great honor to be assigned to the seraglio. Any inmate of it who reached
the age of twenty-five without earning a handkerchief was freed, and
usu- ally found a husband of high estate. In Suleiman’s case the
institution did not lead to physical degeneration, for in most matters
he was a man of signal moderation.</p>
<p>Social life among the Ottomans was unisexual, and lacked the gay
stimu- lus of women’s charms and laughing chatter. Yet manners were as
refined as in Christendom, probably more refined than in any lands
except China, India, Italy, and France. Domestic slaves were numerous,
but they were humanely treated, many laws protected them, and
manumission was easy. 86 Though public sanitation was poor, personal
cleanliness was common. The institution of public baths, which the
Persians seem to have taken from Hel- lenistic Syria, was transmitted to
the Turks. In Constantinople and other large cities of the Ottoman
Empire the public baths were built of marble and attractively decorated.
Some Christian saints had prided themselves on avoiding water; the
Moslem was required to make his ablutions before enter- ing the mosque
or saying his prayers; in Islam cleanliness was really next to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 713</p>
<p>godliness. Table manners were no better than in Christendom; meals
were eaten with the fingers off wooden plates; there were no forks. Wine
was never drunk in the house; there was much drinking of it in taverns,
but there was less drunkenness than in Western lands. 87 Coffee came
into use among the Moslems in the fourteenth century; we hear of it
first in Abyssinia; thence it appears to have passed into Arabia. The
Moslems, we are told, used it originally to keep themselves awake during
religious services. 88 We find no mention of it by a European writer
till 1592. 89</p>
<p>Physically the Turk was tough and strong, and famed for endurance.
Busbeq was astonished to note how some Turks received a hundred blows on
the soles of their feet or on their ankles, “so that sometimes several
sticks of dogw ood are broken on them, without drawing any cry of pain.”
40 Even the ordinary Turk carried himself with dignity, helped by robes
that con- cealed the absurdities of the well-fed form. Commoners donned
a simple fez, which dressy persons enveloped in a turban. Both sexes had
a passion for flowers; Turkish gardens were famous for their color;
thence, apparently, came into Western Europe the lilac, tulip, mimosa,
cherry laurel, and ranun- culus. There was an esthetic side to the Turks
which their wars hardly re- vealed. We are surprised to be told by
Christian travelers that except in war they were “not by nature cruel,”
but “docile, tractable, gentle . . . lovable,” and “generally kind.” 41
Francis Bacon complained that they seemed kinder to animals than to men.
42 Cruelty emerged when security of the faith was threatened; then the
wildest passion was let loose.</p>
<p>The Turkish code was especially hard in war. No foe was entitled
to</p>
<p>quarter; women and children were spared, but able-bodied enemies,
even if unarmed and unresisting, might be slaughtered without sin. 48
And yet many cities captured by Turks fared better than Turkish cities
captured by Chris- tians. When Ibrahim Pasha took Tabriz and Baghdad
(1534), he forbade his soldiers to pillage them or harm the inhabitants;
when Suleiman again took Tabriz (1548) he too preserved it from plunder
or massacre; but when Charles V took Tunis ( 1535), he could pay his
army only by letting it loot. Turkish law, however, rivaled the
Christian in barbarous penalties. Thieves had a hand cut off to shorten
their grasp. 44</p>
<p>Official morals were as in Christendom. The Turks were proud of their
fidelity to their word, and they usually kept the terms of capitulation
of- fered to surrendering foes. But Turkish casuists, like such
Christian counter- parts as St. John Capistrano, held that no promise
could bind the faithful against the interest or duties of their
religion, and that the sultan might abro- gate his own treaties, as well
as those of his predecessors. 45 Christian travelers reported “honesty,
a sense of justice . . . benevolence, integrity, and charity” in the
average Turk, 46 but practically all Turkish office-holders were open to
bribery; a Christian historian adds that most Turkish officials were
ex-</p>

<p>7*4</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>Christians , 47 but we should further add that they had been brought
up as Moslems. In the provinces the Turkish pasha, like the Roman
proconsul, hastened to amass a fortune before the whim of the ruler
replaced him; he exacted from his subjects the full price that he had
paid for his appointment. The sale of offices was as common in
Constantinople or Cairo as in Paris or Rome.</p>
<p>3 . Letters and Arts</p>
<p>The weakest link in Ottoman civilization was its poor equipment for
the acquisition and transmission of knowledge. Popular education was
generally neglected; a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Instruction was mostly confined to students intending to study pedagogy,
law, or administration; in these fields the curriculum was lengthy and
severe. Mohammed II and Suleiman took time to reorganize and improve the
madrasas, and the viziers rivaled the sultans in gifts to these mosque
colleges. Teachers in these institutions enjoyed a higher social and
financial status than their counterparts in Latin Christendom. Their
lectures were formally on the Koran, but they managed to include
literature, mathematics, and philosophy; and their graduates, though
richer in theology than in science, kept fully abreast of the West in
engineering and government.</p>
<p>Only a small minority of the population could read, but nearly all of
these wrote poetry, not excepting Suleiman. Like the Japanese, the Turks
held public competitions in which poets read their offerings; Suleiman
took a courtly pleasure in presiding over such Parnassian games. The
Turks honored a hundred poets in this age, but our immersion in our own
grandeur and idiom has left us unaware of even their greatest lyric
poet, Mahmud Abdu’l -Baqi. His career spanned four reigns, for though he
was forty when Suleiman died, he had another thirty-four years of life
in him. He gave up his early trade as a saddler to live by his verse,
and would surely have suffered want had not Sulei- man befriended him
with sinecures. Adding praise to profit, the Sultan wrote a poem on the
excellence of Baqi’s poetry. Baqi paid him back in a powerful dirge
mourning Sule iman’s death. Even in the translation, which loses dignity
by seeking to preserve the multiple rhymes of the original, something of
the poem’s passion and splendor emerges:</p>
<p>Prince of Fortune’s cavalier! he to whose charger bold,</p>
<p>Whene’er he caracoled or pranced, cramped was earth’s tourney
-square!</p>
<p>He to the luster of whose sword the Magyar bowed his head:</p>
<p>He, the dread gleaming of whose brand the Frank can well declare!</p>
<p>Like tender rose-leaf, gently laid he in the dust his face.</p>
<p>And Earth, the Treasurer, placed him like a jewel in the case.</p>
<p>In truth he was the radiance of rank high and glory great.</p>

<p>Blessings be on the monarch’s soul and spirit— and farewell! 48</p>
<p>The Turks were too busy conquering powerful states to have much time
for those delicate arts that had heretofore distinguished Islam. Some
fine Turkish miniatures were produced, with characteristic simplicity of
design and breadth of style. Representative painting was left to the
scandalous Christians, who in this age continued to adorn with frescoes
the walls of their churches and monasteries; so Manuel Panselinos,
perhaps borrowing some stimulus from Italian Renaissance murals,
frescoed the church of Protaton on Mount Athos ( 1 535 — 36) with
paintings freer, bolder, more graceful, than those of Byzantine times.
The sultans imported artists from West and East — Gentile Bellini from
Venice, Shah Kali and Wali Jan, miniaturists, from heretical Persia. In
painted tiles, however, the Ottomans needed no alien aid; they used them
to dazzling effect. Iznik made a name with the excellence of its
faience. Scutari, Brusa, and Hereke, all in Asia Minor, specialized in
textiles; their brocades and velvets, adorned with floral themes in
crimson and gold, impressed and influenced Venetian and Flemish
designers. Turkish carpets lacked the poetic brilliance of the Persian,
but their stately patterns and warm colors evoked admiration in Europe.
Colbert induced Louis XIV to order French weavers to copy some Turkish
palace rugs, but to no avail; the Islamic mastery remained beyond the
reach of Occidental skill.</p>
<p>Turkish art reached its peak in the mosques of Constantinople.* Not
even Mashhad in its crowded architectural splendor, nor Isfahan in the
days of Shah Abbas, perhaps only Persepolis under Xerxes, equaled, in
Persian or Moslem history, the grandeur of Suleiman’s capital. Here the
spoils of Otto - man victories were shared with Allah in monuments
expressing at once piety and pride, and the determination of the sultans
to awe their people with art as well as arms. Suleiman rivaled his
grandfather, Mohammed the Con- queror, in building; seven mosques rose
to his order; and one of these (1556),</p>
<p>• Not till 1930 was the city officially renamed Istanbul.</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>taking his name, surpassed St. Sophia in beauty, even while imitating
its as- semblage of minor cupolas around a central dome; here, however,
the mina- rets, raising their treble prayer to audacious heights, served
as sparkling counterpoint to the massive base. The interior is a
confusing wealth of decoration: golden inscriptions on marble or
faience, columns of porphyry, arches of white or black marble, windows
of stained glass set in traceried stone, pulpit carved as if it were a
lifetime’s dedication; this is perhaps too sumptuous for reverence, too
brilliant for prayer. An Albanian, Sinan, designed this mosque and
seventy more, and lived, we are told, to the age of one hundred and
ten.</p>
<p>V. SULEIMAN HIMSELF</p>
<p>It was the West that named Suleiman “the Magnificent”; his own people
called him Kanuni, the Lawgiver, because of his share in codifying
Ottoman law. He was magnificent not in appearance but in the size and
equipment of his armies, in the scope of his campaigns, in the adornment
of his city, in the building of mosques, palaces, and the famous “Forty
Arches” aqueduct; magnificent in the splendor of his surroundings and
retinue; magnificent, of course, in the power and reach of his rule. His
empire marched from Baghdad to within ninety miles of Vienna, to within
120 miles of Venice, the Adri- atic’s quondam queen. Except in Persia
and Italy all the cities c elebrated in Biblical and classical lore were
his: Carthage, Memphis, Tyre, Nineveh, Babylon, Palmyra, Alexandria,
Jerusalem, Smyrna, Damascus, Ephesus, Nicaea, Athens, and two Thebes.
Never had the Crescent held so many lands and seas in the hollow of its
curve.</p>
<p>Was the excellence of his rule commensurate with its extent? Probably
not, but we should have to say this of any spacious realm except
Achaemenid Persia and Rome under the Antonines. The area governed was
too vast to be well administered from one center before the coming of
modern com- munications, transport, and roads. Laxity and corruption ran
through the government; yet Luther said: “It is reported that there is
no better temporal rule than among the Turks.” 49 I n religious
toleration Suleiman was bolder and more generous than his Christian
compeers: these thought religious con- formity necessary to national
strength; Suleiman allowed Christians and Jews to practice their
religion freely. “The Turks,” wrote Car dinal Pole, “do not compel
others to adopt their belief. He who does not attack their religion may
profess among them what religion he will; he is safe.” 60 In November
1561, while Scotland, England, and Lutheran Germany were making
Catholicism a crime, and Italy and Spain were making Protestantism a
crime, Suleiman ordered the release of a Christian prisoner, “not
wishing</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 717</p>
<p>to bring any man from his religion by force.” 51 He made a safe home
in his empire for Jews fleeing from the Inquisition in Spain and
Portugal.</p>
<p>His defects appeared more clearly in his family relations than in his
gov- ernment. All are agreed that despite wars — which he excused as
defense by offense — he was a man of refined and kindly sentiment,
generous, humane, and just. 52 His people not only admired him, they
loved him. When, on</p>
<p>Friday, he went to the mosque, they observed complete silence while
he passed; he bowed to them all — Christians and Jews and Mohammedans —
and then prayed for two hours in the temple. We do not hear, in his
case, of that addiction to the harem which was to undermine the health
and power of some later sultans. But we do find him so susceptible to
the passions of love as to forget prudence, justice, and even parental
affection.</p>
<p>In the earlier years of his reign his favorite mistress was a
Circassian slave known as “The Rose of Spring,” marked by that dark and
chisled beauty which for centuries has characterized the women of the
regions around the eastern end of the Black Sea. She bore him a son,
Mustafa, who grew into a handsome, able, and popular youth. Suleiman
entrusted him with important offices and missions, and trained him to
merit as well as inherit the throne. But in the course of love Khurrem —
“The Laughing One”— a Russian captive whom the West called Roxelana, won
the Sultan away from the Circassian; and her beauty, gaiety, and wiles
kept him enchanted till tragedy was con- summated. Overriding the rule
of his recent predecessors, Suleiman made Khurrem his wife (1534), and
he rejoiced in the sons and daughters that she gave him. But as he aged,
and the prospect of Mustafa’s accession loomed, Khurrem dreaded the fate
of her sons, who might legitimately be killed by the new sultan. She
succeeded in marrying her daughter to Rustem Pasha, who in 1544 became
Grand Vizier; and through this wife Rustem was brought to share
Khurrem’s fear of Mustafa’s coming power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mustafa had been sent to govern Diyarbekir, and had dis-
tinguished himself by his valor, tact, and generosity. Khurrem used his
virtues to destroy him; she insinuated to Suleiman that Mustafa was
court- ing popularity with a view to seizing the throne. Rustem charged
that the youth was secretly wooing the Janissaries to his cause. The
harassed Sultan, now fifty-nine, doubted, doubted, wondered, believed.
He went in person to Eregli, summoned Mustafa to his tent, and had him
killed as soon as he appeared (1553). Khurrem and Rustem then found it
simple to induce the Sultan to have Mustafa’s son slain, lest the youth
should seek revenge. Khur~ hem’s son Selim was made prince and heir, and
she died content (1558). But Selim’s brother Bajazet, seeing
assassination as his fate, raised an army to challenge Selim; civil war
raged; Bajazet, defeated, fled to Persia (1559); Shah Tamasp, for
300,000 ducats from Suleiman and 100,000 from Selim, surrendered the
contender; Bajazet was strangled (1561), and his five sons</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>718</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>were put to death for social security. The ailing Sultan, we are
told, thanked Allah that all these troublesome offspring were departed,
and that he could now live in peace. 53</p>
<p>But he found peace boring. He brooded over the news that the Knights
whom he had ousted from Rhodes were strong in Malta, and were rivaling
the Algerian pirates with their own rapacious sorties. If Malta could be
made Moslem, mused the seventy-one-year-old Sultan, the Mediterranean
would be safe for Islam. In April 1 564, he sent a fleet of 1 50 ships,
with 20,000 men, to seize the strategic isle. The Knights, skillfully
led by the resourceful Jean de la V alette, fought with their wonted
bravery; the Turks captured the fort of St. Elmo by sacrificing 6,000
men, but they took nothing else; and the arrival of a Spanish army
compelled them to raise the siege.</p>
<p>The old Magnificent could not end his life on so sour a note.
Maximilian II, who had succeeded Ferdinand as emperor, held back the
tribute promised by his father, and attacked Turkish outposts in
Hungary. Suleiman decided on just one more campaign, and resolved to
lead it himself ( 1566). Through Sofia, Nissa, and Belgrade he rode with
200,000 men. On the night of Sep- tember 5-6, 1 5 66, while besieging
the fortress of Szigetvar, he yielded his life, upright in his tent;
like Vespasian, he was too proud to take death lying down. On September
8 Szigetvar fell, but the siege had cost the Turks 30,000 lives, and
summer was fading. A truce was signed, and the army marched
disconsolately back to Constantinople, bringing not victory but a dead
emperor.</p>
<p>Must we judge and rank him? Compared with his analogues in the West
he seems at times more civilized, at times more barbarous. Of the four
great rulers in this first half of the sixteenth century, Francis,
despite his swash- buckling vanity and his hesitant persecutions,
strikes us as the most civilized; yet he looked to Suleiman as his
protector and ally, without whom he might have been destroyed. Suleiman
won his lifelong duel with the West; indeed, the Emperor Maximilian II
in 1 568 resumed payment of tribute to the Porte. Charles V had stopped
the Sultan at Vienna, but what Christian army had dared approach
Constantinople? Suleiman was master of the Mediterranean, and for a time
it seemed that Rome remained Christian by his and Barba- rossa’s
sufferance. He ruled his empire indiff erently well, but how much more
successfully than poor Charles struggling against the princely frag-
mentation of Germany! He was a despot, by unquestioned custom and the
consent of his people; did the absolutism of Henry VIII in England or of
Charles in Spain win such public affection and confidence? Charles could
hardly have been capable of ordering the execution of his son on mere
sus- picion of disloyalty; but Charles in his old age could cry out for
the blood of heretics, and Henry could send wives and Catholics and
Protestants to the block or the pyre without missing a meal. Suleiman’s
religious tolerance,</p>
<p>SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl)</p>
<p>719</p>
<p>limited though it was, makes these executions look barbarous by
compari- son.</p>
<p>Suleiman fought too many wars, killed half his progeny, had a
creative vizier slain without warning or trial; he had the faults that
go with un- checked power. But beyond question he was the greatest and
ablest ruler of his age.</p>
