Waning of the Renaissance</h4>
<p>r 53 4-7 6</p>
<p>I. THE DECLINE OF ITALY</p>
<p>T HE wars of invasion were not yet at an end, but they had
already</p>
<p>changed the face and character of Italy. The northern provinces had
been so devastated that English envoys advised Henry VIII to leave them
to Charles as a punishment. Genoa had been pillaged; Milan had been
taxed to death. Venice had been subdued by the League of Cambrai and the
opening of new trade routes. Rome, Prato, and Pavia had suffered sack,
Florence had been starved and financially bled, Pisa had half de-
stroyed herself in her struggle for freedom, Siena was exhausted with
revo- lutions. Ferrara had impoverished herself in her long contest with
the popes, and had dishonored herself by abetting the irresponsible
attack upon Rome. The Kingdom of Naples, like Lombardy, had been ravaged
and plundered by foreign armies, and had long languished under alien
dynas- ties. Sicily was already the nursery of brigands. The only
consolation of Italy was that its conquest by Charles V had probably
saved it from spolia- tion by the Turks.</p>
<p>By the settlement of Bologna (1530) the control of Italy passed to
Spain with two exceptions: cautious Venice retained her independence,
and the chastened papacy was confirmed in its sovereignty over the
States of the Church. Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and Milan became Spanish
dependencies, ruled by Spanish viceroys. Savoy and Mantua, Ferrara and
Urbino, which had usually supported or connived with Charles, were
allowed to keep their indigenous dukes subject to their good behavior.
Genoa and Siena re- tained their republican forms, but as Spanish
protectorates. Florence was compelled to accept another line of Medici
rulers, who survived by co- operating with Spain.</p>
<p>The victory of Charles marked another triumph of the modern state
over the Church. What Philip IV of France had begun in 1 303 was
completed by Charles and Luther in Germany, by Francis I in France, by
Henry VIII in England, and all in Clement’s pontificate. The powers of
northern Eu-</p>
<p>686</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 687</p>
<p>rope had not only discovered the weakness of Italy, they had lost
their fear of the papacy. The humiliation of Clement injured the respect
that the transalpine populations had felt for the popes, and prepared
them mentally for their secession from Catholic authority.</p>
<p>In some ways the Spanish hegemony was a boon to Italy. It put an end
for a time to the wars of the Italian states against one another; and
after 1559 it ended, till 1796, the battles of foreign powers on Italian
soil. It gave the people some continuity of political order, and quieted
the fierce indi- vidualism that had made and unmade the Renaissance.
Those who craved order accepted the subjugation with relief; those who
cherished freedom mourned. But soon the costs and penalties of peace by
subjection damaged the economy and broke the spirit of Italy. The high
taxes levied by the viceroys to sustain their pomp and soldiery, the
severity of their laws, the state monopolies in grain and other
necessaries, discouraged industry and commerce; and the native princes,
competing in vain luxury, followed the same policy of taxing to
frustration the economic activity that supported them. Shipping declined
to a point where the surviving galleys could no longer protect
themselves from Berber pirates, who raided ships and coasts and carried
Italians off to serve Moslem dignitaries as slaves. Almost as irksome
were the foreign troops quartered on Italian homes, openly de- spising a
once unrivaled people and civilization, and contributing more than their
share to the sexual laxity of the age.</p>
<p>Another misfortune befell Italy, more enduringly disastrous than the
devastations of war and the subjection to Spain. The rounding of the
Cape of Good Hope (1488) and the opening of an all-water route to</p>
<p>India (1498) provided a cheaper means of transport between the
Atlantic nations and Central Asia and the Far East than the troublesome
route across the Alps to Genoa or Venice, thence to Alexandria, overland
to the Red Sea, and again by ship to India. Moreover, the control of the
eastern Mediterranean by the Turks made that route hazardous, subject to
tribute, piracy, and war; and this was still more true of the route via
Constantinople and the Black Sea. After 1498 Venetian and Genoese trade,
and Florentine finance, declined. As early as 1 502 the Portuguese
bought so much of the available pepper in India that the Egyptian-
Venetian merchants there found little left for export. 1 The price of
pepper rose one third in a year on the Rialto, while in Lisbon it could
be had for half the price that mer- chants had to charge in Venice; 2
the German traders began to desert their Fondaco on the Grand Canal and
transfer their buying to Portugal. Vene- tian statesmanship almost
solved the problem in 1504 by proposing to the</p>
<p>688</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Mameluke government of Egypt a united enterprise to restore the old
canal system between the Nile delta and the Red Sea; but the Turkish
con- quest of Egypt in 1 5 17 blocked the plan.</p>
<p>In that year Luther pinned his rebel theses to the door of a
Wittenberg church. The Reformation was both a cause and a result of the
economic decline of Italy. It was a cause in so far as it diminished the
movement of pilgrims and ecclesiastical revenues from the northern
nations into Rome. It was an effect insomuch as the replacement of the
Mediterranean-Egyp- tian route to India by the all-water route, and the
development of Euro- pean commerce with America, enriched the Atlantic
countries while help- ing to impoverish Italy; German trade moved more
and more down the Rhine to North Sea outlets, less and less over the
mountains to Italy; Ger- many became commercially independent of Italy;
a northward drift and pull of power wrenched Germany from the Italian
web of trade and re- ligion, and gave Germany the will and strength to
stand alone.</p>
<p>The discovery of America had even more lasting effects upon Italy
than the new route to India. Gradually the Mediterranean nations
declined, left on a siding in the movement of men and goods; the
Atlantic nations came to the fore, enriched with American trade and
gold. This was a greater revolution in commercial routes than any that
history had recorded since Greece, by her victory at Troy, had opened to
her vessels the Black Sea route to Central Asia. It would be equaled and
surpassed only by the airplane transformation of trade routes in the
second half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The final factor in the fading of the Renaissance was the Counter
Ref- ormation. To Italy’s own political disorder and moral decay, to her
sub - jugation and desolation by foreign powers, to her loss of trade to
the At- lantic nations, to her forfeiture of revenue in the Reformation,
was now added a detrimental but natural change in the mood and conduct
of the Church. The unformulated, perhaps unconscious, gentlemen’s
agreement</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 689</p>
<p>existence, reacted from tolerance and liberalism to a frightened
conserv- atism that laid severe restraints upon thought, inquiry,
publication, and speech. The Spanish domination affected religion as
well as politics; it shared in transforming the lenient Catholicism of
the Renaissance into the rigid orthodoxy of the Church after the Council
of Trent (1545-63). The popes who followed Clement VII took over the
Spanish system of uniting Church and state in strict control of
religious and intellectual life.</p>
<p>Just as a Spaniard had been instrumental in establishing the
Inquisition when, in the thirteenth century, the Albigensian revolt had
vitally chal- lenged the Church in southern France, and new religious
orders had then been founded to serve the Church and renew the fervor of
the Christian faith, so now in the sixteenth century the rigor of the
Spanish Inquisition was imported into Italy, and a Spaniard founded the
Jesuits (1534) — that remarkable Society of Jesus which would not only
accept the old conven- tual vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience,
but would go forth into the world to spread the orthodox faith, and to
fight, everywhere in Christen- dom, against religious heresy or revolt.
The intensity of religious debate in the age of the Reformation, the
Calvinist intolerance, the mutual perse- cutions in England, encouraged
a corresponding dogmatism in Italy; 3 the urbane Catholicism of Erasmus
gave place to the militant orthodoxy of Ignatius Loyola. Liberalism is a
luxury of security and peace.</p>
<p>That censorship of publications which had begun under Pope Sixtus IV
was extended by the establishment of the Index librorum prohibitorum in
1559 and the Congregation of the Index in 1571. Printing facilitated
cen- sorship; it was easier to watch public printers than private
copyists. So in Venice, which had been so hospitable to intellectual and
political refugees, the state itself, feeling that religious division
would damage social unity and order, instituted (1527) a censorship of
the press, and joined with the Church in suppressing Protestant
publications. Italians here and there re- sisted these policies; the
Roman populace, on the death of Paul IV ( 1559), cast his statue into
the Tiber, and burned the headquarters of the Inquisi- tion to the
ground. 4 But such resistance was sporadic, unorganized, and
ineffectual. Authoritarianism triumphed, and a somber pessimism and res-
ignation fell upon the spirit of the once joyous and exuberant Italian
peo- ple. Even the dark Spanish dress — black cap, black doublet, black
hose, black shoes — became the fashion in once colorful Italy, as if the
people had put on mourning for glory departed and liberty dead. 5</p>
<p>Some moral advance accompanied the intellectual retreat. The conduct
of the clergy improved, now that competitive faiths put them on
their</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>690</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>mettle; and the popes and the Council of Trent reformed many
ecclesiasti- cal abuses. Whether a similar movement occured in the
morals of the laity is hard to determine; apparently it is as easy to
gather instances of sexual irregularity, illegitimacy, incest, obscene
literature, political corruption, robbery, and brutal crime in the Italy
of 1534-76 as before.® The Autobi- ography of Benvenuto Cellini
indicates that fornication, adultery, brigand- age, and murder tempered
the orthodoxy of the age. Criminal law re- mained as severe as before:
torture was frequently applied to innocent witnesses as well as to the
accused, and murderers still had their flesh torn away by red-hot
pincers before being hanged. 7 The restoration of slavery as a major
economic institution belongs to this period. When Pope Paul III opened
war upon England in 1535 he decreed that any English soldiers captured
might lawfully be enslaved. 8 About 1550 the custom developed of using
slaves and convicts to row the galleys of trade and war.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the popes of this period were men of relatively high
morals in their personal life. Paul III was the greatest of them — that
same Ales- sandro Famese who had obtained the cardinalate through the
effect of his sist er’s golden hair upon the spirits of Alexander VI. It
is true that Paul had begotten two bastards; 9 but this had been an
accepted custom in his youth, and Guicciardini could still describe him
as “a man adorned with learning, and of unspotted character.” 10 He had
been trained as a humanist by Pomponius Laetus; his letters rivaled
those of Erasmus in the classic elegance of their Latin; he was an
accomplished conversationalist, and sur- rounded himself with capable
and distinguished men. However, he was elected probably less for his
talents and virtues than for his age and infirmi- ties; he was
sixty-six, and the cardinals could reasonable rely upon him to die soon
and give them another chance to make bargains and receive more lucrative
benefices. 11 He held them at bay for fifteen years.</p>
<p>For Rome his pontificate was among the happiest in the history of the
city. Under his direction Latino Manetti, his maestro delle strade,
drained, leveled, and widened streets, opened up many new public
squares, replaced slum houses with handsome dwellings, and so improved
one avenue — the Corso — that it became the Champs Elysees of Rome. As a
diplomat Paul’s greatest feat was to persuade Charles V and Francis I to
a ten years’ truce (1538). He almost achieved a greater aim — a
reconciliation of the Church with the Protestants of Germany; but his
efforts came too late. He had the courage — so lacking in Clement VII —
to call a general council. Under his presidency and with his approval
the Council of Trent restated the ortho-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 691</p>
<p>dox faith, reformed many ecclesiastical abuses, restored discipline
and morality among the clergy, and shared with the Jesuits in saving the
Latin nations for the Roman Church.</p>
<p>Paul’ s tragic failure was his nepotism. He gave Camerino to his
grandson Ottavio, and he invested his son Pierluigi with Piacenza and
Parma. Pier- luigi was assassinated by discontented citizens, and
Ottavio joined in a con- spiracy against his grandfather. Paul lost his
love of life, and died two years later of a heart stroke at eighty-three
(1549). He was mourned by the Romans as no other pope since Pius II a
century before.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>In those sciences that did not affect theology Italy continued to
make such moderate progress as could come from a nation predominantly
dis- posed to art and literature, and in reaction against an intellect
that had dis- carded conscience. Varoli, Eustachio, and Fallopio, whose
names are im- bedded in the terminology of modern anatomy, date from
this brief age. Niccolo Tartaglia found a way to solve cubic equations;
he confided his method to Jerome Cardan (Geronimo Cardano), who
published it as his own (1545). Tartaglia challenged him to an algebraic
duel, in which each was to propose thirty-one problems to be solved by
the other. Cardan ac- cepted, but disdainfully delegated one of his
pupils to solve Tartaglia’s problems. The pupil failed, Tartaglia
succeeded, but Cardan wrote a strange and fascinating autobiography
which has kept his head above the Lethe of time.</p>
<p>It begins with the startling candor that characterizes it to the
end:</p>
<p>Although various abortive medicines, as I have heard, were tried</p>
<p>in vain, I was born on September 24, 1501…. Since Jupiter was</p>
<p>in the ascendant and Venus ruled the horoscope, I was not maimed save
in the genitals, so that from my twenty-first to my thirty-first</p>
<p>year I was unable to lie with women; and many a time I lamented my
fate, envying all other men their good fortune. 12</p>
<p>This was only one of his disabilities. He stuttered, suffered all his
life from hoarseness and catarrh of the throat, frequently from
indigestion, palpita- tion of the heart, rupture, colic, dysentery,
hemorrhoids, gout, itching skin, a cancerous growth on the left nipple,
the plague, tertian fever, and “an annual period of sleeplessness
lasting about eighty days.” “In 1536 I was</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>6 92</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>overtaken with an extraordinary discharge of urine; and although for
nearly forty years I have been afflicted with this trouble, giving from
sixty to a hundred ounces in a single day, I live well.” 13</p>
<p>Endowed with all this clinical experience, he became a successful
physi- cian, cured himself of almost everything except vanity, achieved
the repu- tation of being the most sought-for physician in Italy, and
was called as far afield as Scotland to cure an incurable archbishop,
whom he cured. At thirty-four he gave public lectures in Milan on
mathematics, and at thirty- five on medicine. In 1545, borrowing a title
from Raymond Lully, he pub- lished a book, Ars magna, wherein he made
substantial contributions to algebra — which still speaks of “Cardan’s
rule” for solving cubic equations. He was apparently the first to
perceive that quadratic equations might have negative roots. With
Tartaglia, and long before Descartes, he considered the application of
algebra to geometry. 14 In De subtilitate rerum (1551) he discussed
painting and color; in De rerum varietate (1557) he summarized the
physical knowledge of his time; both of these books owed much to
Leonardo’s unpublished manuscripts. 15 Amid sickness, travels, and devas
- tating tribulations, he wrote 230 books, of which 138 have been
printed. Some he had the courage to burn.</p>
<p>He taught medicine in the universities of Pavia and Bologna, but
so</p>
<p>mingled his science with occultism and braggadocio that he forfeited
the respect of his colleagues. He devoted a large volume to the
relations be- tween the planets and the human face. He was as expert and
absurd as Freud in interpreting dreams, and as firm a believer in
guardian angels as Fra Angelico. Yet he named, as the ten greatest
intellects in history, men not overwhelmingly Christian: Archimedes,
Aristotle, Euclid, Apollonius of Perga, Archytas of Tarentum,
al-Khwarizmi, al-Kindi, Gebir, Duns</p>
<p>Scotus, and Richard Swineshead — all scientists except Duns. Cardan
made a hundred enemies, invited a thousand calumnies, married miserably,
and fought unsucessfully to save his eldest son from being executed for
poison- ing an unfaithful wife. In 1570 he moved to Rome. He was
arrested there for debt or heresy or both; but Gregory XIII released and
pensioned him.</p>
<p>At seventy-four he wrote De vita propria liber ( A Book of My Own</p>
<p>Life) — one of three remarkable autobiographies composed in this
period in Italy. With almost the garrulousness and fidelity of
Montaigne, he analyzes himself — body, mind, character, habits, likes
and dislikes, virtues and vices, honors and dishonors, errors and
prophecies, illnesses, eccentricities, and dreams. He accuses himself of
obstinacy, bitterness, unsociability, hasty judgment, pugnacity,
cheating at gambling, vengefulness, and mentions</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 693</p>
<p>“the debaucheries of the Sardanapalian life I led in the year when I
was rector of the University of Padua.” 18 He lists “things in which I
feel that I have failed”— especially the proper rearing of his sons. But
he lists also seventy-three books that mention him; tells of his many
successful cures and predictions, and his invincibility in debate. He
bemoans the perse- cutions to which he was subjected, and the hazards
“that beset me on ac - count of my unorthodox views.” 17 He asks
himself, “What animal do I find more treacherous, vile, and deceitful
than man?” and offers no reply. But he records many things that give him
happiness, including change, food, drink, sailing, music, puppies, cats,
continence, and sleep. “Of all ends that man may attain, none seems more
worthy or more pleasing than the recognition of truth.” 18 His favorite
pursuit was medicine, in which he achieved many surprising cures.</p>
<p>Medicine was the only science that made any significant progress in
this p eriod of Italy’s decline. The greatest scientists of the age
spent many years in Italy as students and teachers — Copernicus from
1496 to 1506, Vesalius from 1537 to 1546; but we must not steal them
from Poland and Flanders to further honor Italy. Realdo Colombo, who
succeeded Vesalius as professor of anatomy at Padua, expounded the
pulmonary circulation of the blood in De re anatomica (1558), probably
unaware that Servetus had proposed the same theory twelve years before.
Colombo practised the dis- section of human cadavers at Padua and Rome,
apparently without ec- clesiastical opposition; 19 he seems also to have
vivisected dogs. Gabriele Fallopio, a pupil of Vesalius, discovered and
described the semicircular canals and the chorda tympani of the ear, and
the tubes, now named after him, that bear the ova from the ovaries to
the uterus. Bartolommeo Eusta- chio described and gave his name to the
Eustachian tube of the ear and the Eustachian valve of the heart; to him
also we owe the discovery of the abducens nerve, the suprarenal bodies,
and the thoracic duct. Costanzo Varoli studied the pons Varolii — a mass
of nerves on the undersurface of the brain.</p>
<p>We have no figures as to the effects of medicine on human longevity
in the Renaissance. Varoli died at thirty-two, Fallopio at forty,
Colombo at forty-three, Eustachio at fifty; on the other hand
Michelangelo lived to eighty-nine, Titian to ninety-nine, Luigi Cornaro
to approximately a cen- tury. Born at Venice in 1467 or earlier, Luigi
was rich enough to indulge in every luxury of food, drink, and love.
These “excesses caused me to fall a prey to various ailments, such as
pains in the stomach, frequent pains in the side, symptoms of gout… a
low fever that was almost continuous…</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>

<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>and an unquenchable thirst. This evil condition left me nothing to
hope for except that death should terminate my troubles.” When he was
forty his physicians abandoned all medicaments and advised him that his
only hope of recovery lay in “a temperate and orderly life I was not to
par -</p>
<p>ake of any foods, either solid or liquid, save such as are prescribed
for in- valids; and of these in small quantities only.” He was allowed
to eat meat</p>
<p>He spent a quiet and comfortable old age at Padua, undertook and fi-
nanced public works, and wrote, at eighty-three, his autobiographical
Discorsi della vita sobria. Tintoretto has pictured him for us in a
delectable portrait: bald head but ruddy face, eyes clear and
penetrating, wrinkles spelling benevolence, white beard thinned with
years, hands still revealing, so near to death, an aristocratic youth.
His octogenarian vivacity encour- ages us as he rallies those who
thought life after seventy to be a meaningless valetudinarian
procrastination:</p>
<p>Let them come and see, and wonder at my good health, how I</p>
<p>mount on horseback without help, how I run upstairs and uphill,</p>
<p>how cheerful, amusing, and contented I am, how free from care and
disagreeable thoughts. Peace and joy never quit me…. All my</p>
<p>senses (thank God!) are in the best condition, including the sense of
taste; for I enjoy more the simple food that I now take in moderation
than all the delicacies that I ate in my years of disorder…. When</p>
<p>I come home I see before me not one or two but eleven grandchil-</p>
<p>dren…. I take delight in hearing them sing and play on different</p>
<p>musical instruments. I sing myself, and find my voice better,
clearer,</p>
<p>and louder than ever My life, therefore, is alive, not dead; nor</p>
<p>would I exchange my old age for the youth of such as live in the</p>
<p>service of their passions. 21</p>
<p>At eighty- six, “full of health and strength,” he wrote a second
discourse, expressing his joy at the conversion of several friends to
his way of life. At ninety- one he added a third essay, and told how “I
constantly write, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 695</p>
<p>with my own hand, eight hours a day, and…. in addition to this I walk
and sing for many other hours… For I feel, when I leave the table, that
I</p>
<p>must sing Oh, how beautiful and sonorous my voice has become!” At
ninety- two he composed “A loving exhortation… to all mankind to follow
the orderly and temperate life.” 22 He looked forward to completing a
cen - tury, and to an easy death through the gradual diminution of his
senses, feelings, and vital spirits. He died peacefully in 1566; some
say at ninety- nine, others at one hundred and three or four. His wife,
we are told, obeyed his precepts, lived to nearly a century, and died in
“perfect ease of body and security of soul.” 23</p>
<p>We must not expect to find a major philosopher in so small a span of
space and time. Iacopo Aconzio, an Italian Protestant, in a treatise De
methodo (1558), prepared part of the way for Descartes; and in De
strata- gematibus Satanae (1565) he had the audacity to suggest that all
Christi- anity might be reduced to a few doctrines held by all
Christians, and not including the idea of the Trinity. 24 Mario Nizzoli
made a path for Francis Bacon by inveighing against the continued reign
of Aristotle in philosophy, appealing for direct observation against
deductive reasoning, and denounc- ing logic as the art of proving the
false to be true. 25 Bernardino Telesio of Cosenza, in De rerum natura
(1565-86), joined Nizzoli and Pierre La</p>
<p>Ramee in the spreading revolt against the authority of Aristotle, and
called for empirical science: Nature must be explained in her own terms
through the experience of our senses. What we see, said Telesio, is
matter acted upon by two forces: heat coming from the sky, cold rising
from the earth; heat producing expansion and motion, cold producing
contraction and rest; in the conflict of these two principles lies the
inner essence of all physical phenomena. These phenomena proceed
according to natural causes and inherent laws, without the intervention
of deity. Nature, how- ever, is not inert; there is a soul in things as
well as in man. Tommaso Cam- panella, Giordano Bruno, and Francis Bacon
would all take something from these ideas. Some measure of liberalism
must have survived in the Church to let Telesio die a natural death
(1588). Twelve years later the Inquisition would burn Bruno at the
stake.</p>

<p>The great age of Italian scholarship was now ended: France took the

1526.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>696</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Note the effect of war upon the book trade: in the last decade of the
fif- teenth century Florence published 179 books, Milan 228, Rome 460,
Ven- ice 1491; in the first decade of the sixteenth century Florence
published 47, Milan 99, Rome 41, Venice 536.“ The academies founded for
classical scholarship — the Platonic Academy at Florence, the Roman
Academy of Pomponius Laetus, the Neacademia at Venice, the Neapolitan
Academy of Pontanus — died out in this period; the study of pagan
philosophy was frowned upon except in a Scholastified Aristotle; and
Latin gave place to Italian as the language of literature. New academies
sprang up, chiefly de- voted to literary and linguistic criticism, and
serving as central exchanges of ears for the poets of the town. So
Florence had the Della Crusca Acad- emy (1572) and the Umidi; Venice had
the Pellegrini, Padua the Eretei; and each new society took a sillier
name. These academies encouraged tal- ent and stifled genius; poets
struggled to obey the rules laid down by the purists, and inspiration
fled to airier haunts. Michelangelo belonged to no literary academy, and
though he, like the rest, indulged his Muse in trite conceits, and
forced his fire into cold Petrarchian molds, his sonnets, rough in form
but warm in feeling and thought, are the best Italian poetry of the
time. Luigi Alamanni fled from Florence to France, and composed a poem
on agriculture — La coltivazione — which did not fall far short of
Virgil’s Georgies in combining tillage with poetry.* Bernardo Tasso
rehearsed, in the misfortunes of his life, the vicissitudes of his
famous son Torquato; his lyrics are among the choicest artificialities
of the age; his epic, Amadigi, versified with heavy seriousness the
chivalric romance, Amadis de Gaul. The Italian public, missing in it
Ariosto’s leavening humor, gave it a quiet burial.</p>
<p>The novella, or short story, had remained popular ever since The
Decam- eron had given it a classic form. Written in simple language, and
usually describing dramatic incidents or intimate scenes of Italian
life, the novelle were welcomed by all ranks. Often they were read aloud
to avid listeners, none more avid than the letterless, so that their
audience was all Italy. We may marvel today at the broad tolerance of
Renaissance women who heard these tales without reported blushing. Love,
seduction, violence, adventure, humor, sentiment, descriptions of
scenery, provided the material of the stories, and every class furnished
types and characters.</p>
<p>Almost every city had a skilled practitioner of the form. At
Salerno</p>
<ul>
<li>Alamanni shared with Trissino and Giovanni Rucellai the distinction
of being among the first writers of blank verse — verst sciolti — in
Italy.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 697</p>
<p>Tommaso de’ Guardati, known as Masuccio, published in 1476 his
Novellino — fifty stories illustrating the generosity of princes, the
incontinence of women, the vices of monks, and the hypocrisy of mankind.
Less polished than Boccaccio’s novelettes, they often surpass them in
sincerity, power, and eloquence. At Siena the novella took on a highly
sensuous quality, filling its pages with tales of unlicensed love.
Florence had four famous novellieri. Franco Sacchetti, friend and
imitator of Boccaccio, outwinded him by writing three hundred novelle,
whose vulgarity and obscenity made them almost universally popular.
Agnolo Firenzuola devoted many of his stories to satirizing the sins of
the clergy; he described the goings-on in a dissolute convent, exposed
the arts by which confessors induced pious women to leav e legacies to
monasteries, and himself became a monk of the Vallombrosan order.
Antonfrancesco Grazzini, known to Italy as il Lasca, the Boach, excelled
in comic stories, featuring the prankster Pilucca, but he could also
season his dish with sex and blood, as when a husband, finding his wife
in adultery with his son, cuts off their hands and feet, cuts out their
eyes and tongues, and lets them bleed to death on their bed of love. An-
tonfrancesco Doni, a Servite monk and priest, was expelled from the
clois- ter of the Annunciation (1540), apparently for sodomy; at
Piacenza he joined a club of profligates devoted to Priapus; in Venice
he became a de- voted enemy of Aretino, against whom he wrote a pamphlet
ominously entitled “Earthquake of Doni the Florentine, with the Ruin of
the Great</p>
<p>The best of the novellieri was Matteo Bandello, whose life spanned
half a continent and most of a century (1480-1562). Born near Tortona,
he was soon entered into the Dominican order, whose general was his
uncle. He grew up in the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan;
he was presumably there when Leonardo painted The Last Supper in the
refectory, and when Beatrice d’Este was buried in the adjoining church.
He lived at Mantua for six years as tutor in the ruling family, carried
on a flirtation with Lucrezia Gonzaga, and saw Isabella fight with all
her arts the coming of old age. Returning to Milan, he actively
supported the French against the Spanish-German forces in Italy; after
the French disaster at Pavia his house was burned and his library was
almost totally destroyed, including a Latin dictionary which he had
almost completed. He fled to France, served Cesare Fregoso, General of
the Dominicans, well, and was made Bishop of Agen (1550). In his leisure
hours he gathered together the 2 14 stories that</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>698</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>he had written during the years, gave them their finished literary
form, covered their mild indecency with his episcopal absolution, and
had them printed in three volumes at Lucca (1554), and a fourth at Lyons
(1573).</p>
<p>As in the other novellieri , so in Bandello the plots turn mostly on
love or violence, or the morals of friars, monks, and priests. A sweet
lass re- venges herself upon a faithless lover by tearing him to pieces
with pincers; a husband forces his adulterous wife to strangle her lover
with her own hands; a convent abandoned to debauchery is described with
tolerant good humor. Some of Bandello’s stories provided material for
exciting dramas, as when Webster took from one of them the plot for The
Duchess of Malfi. Bandello tells with feeling and skill the romance of
Romeo Montecchio and Giulietta Capelletti, and vividly conveys the
passion of their love. Shall we sample him at his most romantic?</p>
<p>Romeo, not daring to inquire who the damsel was, applied himself</p>
<p>o feed his eyes on her lovely sight, and minutely considering all</p>
<p>her movements, drank the sweet amorous poison, marvelously com-
mending her every part and gesture. He was seated in a corner</p>
<p>wherein, when dancing was toward, all passed before him. Giulietta
(for so was the damsel called) was the daughter of the master of the
house and giver of the feast. And she likewise, not knowing Romeo, but
seeing withal that he was the handsomest and sprightliest youth that
might be found, was marvelously pleased with his sight, and</p>
<p>softly and furtively eyeing him a while askance, felt I know not what
sweetness at heart, which all to-flooded her with exceeding delight;
wherefore she would fain have had him join the dance, so she might the
better see him and hear him speak, herseeming as much delight should
issue from his speech as she still drank in at his eyes, what</p>
<p>while she gazed on him; but he sat all alone and showed no wish
to</p>
<p>dance. All his study was to ogle the fair damsel, and she thought
of</p>
<p>nothing but to look upon him, and so they viewed each other on</p>
<p>such wise that, their eyes bytimes encountering, and the flashing</p>
<p>rays of the one and the other’s glances mingling, they lightly
per-</p>
<p>ceived that they eyed each other amorously; more by token that,</p>
<p>whenassoever their eyes met, both filled the air with amorous sighs,
and it seemed they desired for the nonce no otherwhat than to dis- cover
one to other by speech their newborn flame. 27</p>
<p>The climax in Bandello is subtler than in Shakespeare. Instead of
Romeo dying before Juliet emerges from her coma, she awakes before Romeo
feels the effect of the poison he has drunk in despair at her apparent
death. In</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 699</p>
<p>his joy at her recovery he forgets the poison, and the lovers have a
few moments of delirious joy. When the poison wreaks its force and Romeo
dies, Juliet stabs herself with his sword.*</p>

</ol>
<p>It is easier to rule a state in its decline than in its youth;
diminished vital- ity almost welcomes subjugation. Florence, beaten down
again by the Medici (1530), submitted wearily to domination by Clement
VII; it re- joiced when the coarse tyrant Aless andro de’ Medici was
slain by his re - mote relative Lorenzino (1537); and, instead of
seizing the opportunity to re-establish the republic, it accepted a
second Cosimo, in hopes that he might show the wisdom and statesmanship
of the first. The direct line of Cosimo Pater Patriae was now legally
extinct; the younger Cosimo was descended from his older namesake’s
brother Lorenzo (1395 -1440). Guicciardini manoeuvred the new ruler,
then eighteen, into lordship in the hope of being the power behind the
throne; but he forgot that the young Medici was the son of Giovanni
delle Bande Nere and the grandson of Caterina Sforza, and therefore had
at least two generations of iron in his blood. Cosimo took the reins in
his own hands, and held them firmly for twenty-seven years.</p>
<p>His character and government mingled evil and good. He was as severe
and cruel as unsentimental policy might dictate. He did not bother, like
earlier Medici, to maintain republican forms and fagade. He arranged a
system of espionage that entered every family, and used parish priests
as spies. 29 He enforced unanimity of professed religious belief, and
co-oper- ated with the Inquisition. He was greedy of wealth and power,
exploited the state monopoly of grain, taxed his subjects avidly,
overthrew the semi- republic of Siena to make that city, like Arezzo and
Pisa, part of his domin- ions, and persuaded Pope Pius V to give him the
title of grand duke of Tuscany (1569).</p>
<p>In partial compensation for the absolutism of his rule, he organized
ef- ficient administration, a reliable army and police, a competent and
incor- ruptible judiciary. He lived simply, avoided costly ceremony and
display, managed finances stringently, and left a full treasury to his
son and heir. The order and safety that were now maintained on streets
and highways</p>
<p>•Shakespeare took the story from Arthur Broke’s Tragical History of
Romeus and Juliet (1562); Broke took it from Masuccio or Bandello.
Shakespeare also knew the tale in William Painter’s Palace of Pleasure
(1566), which took it from Bandello. 28</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>700</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>revived the commerce and industry that had ailed under repeated
revolu- tions. Cosimo brought in new manufactures, as of coral and
glass; he in- vited and protected Portuguese Jews as a stimulus to
industrial develop- ment; he enlarged Livorno (Leghorn) as a busy port.
He had the marshes of the Maremma drained in an effort to free that
region, and nearby Siena, from malaria. Under his conscientious
despotism Siena, like Florence, be- came more prosperous than ever
before. He used part of his levied wealth to support literature and art
without extravagance and with discrimination. He raised the Accademia
degli Umidi to an official position as the Ac- cademia Fiorentina, and
commissioned it to set norms for proper Tuscan usage. He befriended
Vasari and Cellini, tried hard to win Michelangelo back to Florence, and
founded, under his absent presidency, an Arte del Disegno, or Academy of
Design. He established at Pisa ( 1 544) a school of botany second only
to Padua’s in age and excellence. Doubtless Cosimo would have argued
that he could not have accomplished this good had he not begun with a
little evil and an iron fist.</p>
<p>At forty-five this iron Duke was already worn out with the strains of
power and family tragedies. Within a few months, in 1562, his wife and
two of his sons died from malarial fever caught during his efforts to
drain the Maremma swamps. A year later he lost a daughter. In 1564 he
resigned the actual government to his son Francesco. He tried to console
himself with amours but found more boredom in promiscuity than in
marriage. He died in 1574, aged fifty-five. He had lived up to the best
and the worst in his ancestry.</p>
<p>Though Florence no longer produced Leonardos or Michelangelos, and
had no artists to compare in this period with the urbane and universal
Titian, the volcanic Tintoretto, or the festal Veronese, she experienced
under her second Cosimo as vigorous a revival as could be expected from
a generation that had grown up amid frustrated revolt and unsuccessful
war. Even so, Cellini judged the artists employed by Cosimo to be “a
band the like of which is not to be found at present in the world” 30 —
which is a typically Florentine understatement of Venetian art.
Benvenuto thought the Duke a patron with more taste than generosity, but
perhaps this able governor considered economic reconstruction and
political order more vital than the artistic decoration of his court.
Vasari described Cosimo as “loving and favoring all artists, and indeed
all men of genius.” It was</p>
<p>Cosimo who financed at Chiusi, Arezzo, and elsewhere the excavations
that revealed a remarkable Etruscan culture, and unearthed the famous
Etruscan bronze statues of The Chimera, The Orator, and Minerva. He
bought back</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 7OI</p>
<p>as many as he could locate of the art treasures looted from the
Medici palace in 1494 and 1527, added his own collections to them, and
housed the total in that palace-fortress that Luca Pitti had begun a
hundred years be- fore. Cosimo had this monstrous edifice enlarged by
Bartolommeo Am- manati, and made it his official dwelling (1553).</p>
<p>Ammanati and Vasari were in Florence the leading architects of the
age. It was Ammanati who laid out for Cosimo the famous Boboli Gardens
be- hind the Pitti Palace, and spanned the Arno with the beautiful Santa
Trinita Bridge (1567-70) — destroyed in the Second World War. He was
also a painter and sculptor of quality; he won sculptural competitions
from Cellini and Giovanni da Bologna, and carved the Juno that adorns
the Bargello court. In his old age he apologized for having made many
pagan figures. The Pagan Renaissance had now (1560) run its course, and
Chris- tianity was regaining its hold on the Italian mind.</p>
<p>Cosimo made Baccio Bandinelli his favorite sculptor, to the horror of
Cellini. One of Cosimo’s recreations was in hearing Cellini berate Bandi
- nelli. Baccio was popular with himself; he proclaimed his intention to
sur- pass Michelangelo, and was so critical of other artists that one of
the gentlest, Andrea Sansovino, tried to kill him. Nearly everybody
hated him, but his many commissions in Florence and Rome suggest that
his talent was better than his character. When Leo X wished to duplicate
the complex Laocoon group of the Belvedere as a gift to Francis I,
Cardinal Bibbiena asked Bandinelli to undertake the assignment; Baccio
promised to make a copy superior to the original. To the general dismay
he almost suc- ceeded. Clement VJI was so pleased with the result that
he sent authentic antiques to Francis and kept Baccio’s copy for the
Medici Palace in Flor - ence, whence it passed to the Uffizi Gallery.
For Clement and Alessandro de’ Medici Bandinelli carved a gigantic
group, Hercules and Cacus, which was set up on the porch of the Palazzo
Vecchio beside Michelangelo’s David. Cellini did not like it. “If your
Hercules had his hair cropped,” he told Bandinelli in Cosimo’s presence,
“he would not have skull enough to hold his brains…. His heavy shoulders
remind one of the two baskets of a donkey’s packsaddle. His chest and
muscles are copied not from na - ture but from a bag of bad melons.” 31
Clement, however, thought the Hercules a masterpiece, and rewarded the
sculptor with a substantial prop- erty in addition to the promised fee.
Baccio repaid the compliment by giv- ing the name Clement to a bastard
born to him soon after the Pope’s death. His last work was a tomb
prepared by him for himself and his father; as soon as it was finished
he occupied it (1560). Probably he would have</p>
<p>702 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>greater renown today had he not been invidiously immortalized by two
artists who could write as well as design — Vasari and Cellini.</p>
<p>Giovanni da Bologna was a more genial competitor. Born at Douai, he
made his way in youth to Rome (1561), resolved to be a sculptor. After a
year of study there he brought a clay sample of his work to the aged Mi-
chelangelo. The old sculptor took it in his hands, pressed it here arid
there with his worn fingers and heavy thumbs, and in a few moments
molded it to greater significance. Giovanni never forgot that visit;
throughout the remainder of his eighty-four years he labored with
unrelaxing ambition to equal the Titan. He started back to Flanders, but
a Florentine nobleman advised him to study the art collected in
Florence, and for three years main- tained him in his palace. There were
so many Italian artists in or near the city that it took the Fleming
five years to win acceptance for his work. Then Francesco, son of Duke
Cosimo, bought his Venus. He entered a competition to design a fountain
for the Piazza della Signoria; Cosimo judged him too young for so
responsible an assignment, but his model was rated best by many artists,
and probably it won him an invitation to build a much larger fountain in
Bologna. After that Giovanni was brought back to Florence as official
sculptor for the Medici, and never lacked commis- sions. When he went to
Rome again Vasari introduced him to the Pope as “the prince of the
sculptors of Florence.’ 732 In 1583 he modeled a group, now in the
Loggia dei Lanzi, and named in afterthought The Rape of the Sabines: a
hero virile and muscular holds in his grasp a ravishing woman whose soft
form is realistically compressed against his supporting hand, and whose
back is the loveliest in the bronze sculpture of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The sculptors surpassed the painters in Cosimo’s galaxy and regard.
Ridolfo Ghirlandaio strove but failed to maintain his father’s
excellence; we may sample him from his portrait of Lucrezia Summaria in
Washington. Francesco Ubertini, nicknamed il Bachiacca, liked to paint
historical scenes in great detail on a small scale. Iacopo Carrucci,
called Pontormo from his birthplace, had every advantage and a good
start; he received instruction from Leonardo, Piero di Cosimo, and
Andrea del Sarto; and at nineteen (1513) he stirred the art world with a
painting, now lost, that aroused the admiration of Michelangelo and was
pronounced by Vasari “the finest fresco ever seen till then.” 33 But
soon afterward, to the disgust of the Italians, Pontormo fell in love
with the engravings of Diirer, abandoned the smooth lines and harmonies
of the Italian style, preferred crude and heavy Germanic forms, and
pictured men and women in poses of physical or mental disturbance. In
frescoes at the Certosa outside Florence Pontormo</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 703</p>
<p>painted in this Teutonic style scenes from the passion of Christ.
Vasari re- sented this imitation: “Was not Pontormo aware that Germans
and Flem - ings come to learn the Italian style, which he made such
effort to shake off as if it were bad?” 34 Even so, Vasari confessed the
power of these frescoes. Pontormo further complicated his art by
developing phobias. He never al- lowed death to be mentioned in his
presence; he avoided feasts and crowds, lest he be crushed to death;
though himself kind and gentle, he distrusted nearly everyone except his
beloved pupil Bronzino. More and more he courted solitude, until he
formed the habit of sleeping in an upper-story room reachable only by a
ladder which he pulled up after him. On his final assignment — to fresco
the main chapel of San Lorenzo — he worked for eleven years in
isolation, boarding up the chapel and allowing none but himself to
enter. He died (1556) before finishing the task; and when the frescoes
were unveiled it was seen that the figures were badly dispropor- tioned,
the faces excited or melancholy. Let us remember him by a work of his
saner maturity, the lovely portrait of Ugolino Martelli now in Wash-
ington-soft feathered hat, pensive eyes, luminous raiment, immaculate
hands.</p>
<p>Agnolo di Cosimo di Mariano, renamed Bronzino, distinguished himself
by a remarkable series of portraits, chiefly of the Medici. The Medici
Palace contains a gallery of them, from Cosimo Pater Patriae to Duke
Cosimo; and if we may judge from the pouchy face of his Leo X, they were
often truthful. The best of them is of Giovanni delle Bande Nere
(Uffizi) — a veritable Napoleon before Bonaparte — handsome, proud, and
breathing fire.</p>
<p>Probably Duke Cosimo’s favorite artist was the man to whom this and
every book on the Italian Renaissance owes half its life — Giorgio
Vasari. The family into which he was bom at Arezzo already included
several artists; he was distantly related to Luca Signorelli, and he has
told us how the old painter, seeing Gior gio’s boyhood drawings,
encouraged him in studying design. In one of those innumerable acts of
magnanimous and clairvoyant patronage that should be considered in
judging the morals of the Renaissance, Cardinal Passerini, who had been
appointed guardian of Ippolito and Alessandro de’ Medici, took Giorgio
to Florence; and there</p>
<p>When the Medici were expelled from Florence in 1 527, Giorgio
returned to Arezzo. At eighteen, his father having died of plague, he
found himself</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>704</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>he chief support of his three sisters and two young brothers. Ag ain
kind- ness rescued him. His former fellow pupil, Ippolito de’ Medici,
invited him to Rome, where for three years Vasari sedulously studied
ancient and Renaissance art; and in 1530 Alessandro, master of Florence
after another restoration, called him to live and paint in the Palazzo
Medici. There he made portraits of the family, including Lorenzo the
Magnificent in a somber study, and the vivacious young Caterina — posing
and opposing at whim, as if already conscious that she would be queen of
France. When Alessandro was assassinated Vasari wandered for some time
patronless. His paintings are rudely dealt with by modern critics, but
they must have earned him some repute, for at Mantua he was housed by
Giulio Romano, and at Venice Aretino was his burly chaperone. Wherever
he went he carefully studied the local art, talked with artists or their
descendants, collected drawings and made notes. Back in Rome, he painted
for Bindo Altoviti a Deposition from th e Cross, which, he tells us,
“had the good fortune not to displease the greatest sculptor, painter,
and architect that ever lived in our time.”</p>
<p>It was this Michelangelo who introduced him to the second Cardinal
Alessandro Famese; and it was this cultivated prelate who, in 1546, sug-
gested to Vasari that he should compose for the guidance of posterity
the fives of the artists who had so distinguished the Italy of the
preceding two hundred years. While busily serving as painter and
architect in Rome, Rimini, Ravenna, Arezzo, and Florence, Giorgio
devoted part of his time to the unremunerative labor of the Lives,
“moved by love for these our artists.” In 1550 he published the first
edition of these Vite de ’ piu ec - celenti pittori, scultori, ed
architetti lta.lia.ni, with an eloquent dedication to Duke Cosimo.</p>
<p>From 1555 to 1572 he was Cosimo’s chief artist. He remodeled the in -
terior of the Palazzo Vecchio and decorated many of its walls with
paint- ings more immense than magnificent; he raised the vast
administration build- ing known from its governmental offices as the
Uffizi, and now one of the great art galleries of the world. He led in
completing the Laurentian</p>
<p>Library, and he constructed the enclosed corridor that enabled Cosimo
to pass under cover from the Palazzo Vecchio and the Uffizi across the
Ponte Vecchio to the new ducal residence in the Pitti Palace. In 1567 he
spent several months in travel and research, and a year later he brought
out a new and much enlarged edition of the Lives. He died in Florence in
1574, and was buried with his ancestors in Arezzo.</p>
<p>He was not a great artist but he was a good man, an industrious

<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 705</p>
<p>or, and (barring a few bites at Bandinelli) a generous as well as
intelligent critic. In simple, racy, almost colloquial Tuscan, and
occasionally with the vividness of the novelle, he gave us one of the
most interesting books of all time, from which a thousand other volumes
have been cribbed. It is rich in inaccuracies, anachronisms, and
contradictions, but richer still in fasci- nating information and
judicious interpretation. It did for the artists of Renaissance Italy
what Plutarch had done for the martial or civic heroes of Greece and
Rome. It will remain for centuries to come one of the classics of the
world’s literature.</p>
<p>V. BENVENUTO CELLINI: I5OO-71</p>
<p>There was in this age at the court of Cosimo a man who united in his
character all the violence and sensitivity, all the mad pursuit of
beauty in life and art, all the exhilarating pride of health, skill, or
power, that dis- tinguished the Renaissance; who, moreover, possessed
the spontaneous ca- pacity to pour forth his thoughts and feelings,
vicissitudes and accomplish- ments, in one of the most engaging and
unforgettable of all autobiographies. Benvenuto was not — no one man
could be — completely typical of the Ren- aissance genius; he lacked the
piety of Angelico, the craft of Machiavelli, the modesty of Castiglione,
the blithe suavity of Raphael; and surely not all Italian artists of the
time took the law into their own hands as Benvenuto did. Yet, as we read
his turbulent narrative, we feel that his book, more than any other,
more even than Vasari’s Lives, takes us behind the scenes, and into the
heart, of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>He begins disarmingly:</p>
<p>All men, of whatsoever quality they be, who have done anything</p>
<p>of excellence, or which may properly resemble excellence, ought,</p>
<p>if they are persons of truth and honesty, to describe their life
with</p>
<p>heir own hand; but they ought not to attempt so fine an enterprise
till they have passed the age of forty. This duty occurs to my own</p>
<p>mind, now that I am traveling beyond the term of fifty-eight
years,</p>
<p>and am in Florence, the city of my birth.</p>
<p>He is proud that he was “bom humble” and made his family famous; at
the same time he assures us that he was descended from a captain of
Julius Caesar; “in a work like this,” he warns us, “there will always be
found oc - casion for natu ral bragging.” 85 He was called Benvenuto—
welcome — be- cause his parents expected a girl and were pleasantly
surprised. His grand-</p>

<p>706</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>father (probably violating all of Cornaro’s precepts) lived a hundred
years; Cellini, inheriting his vitality, crowded as many into
seventy-one. His father was an engineer, a worker in ivory, and a
devotee of the flute; his fond hope was that Benvenuto would become a
professional flutist and play in the band at the Medici court; in later
years he seems to have derived more pleasure from hearing that his son
had become a flutist in Pope Clement’s private orchestra than from the
goldsmithery by which the youth was earning florins and fame.</p>
<p>But Benvenuto was enamored of beautiful forms rather than of
melodious sounds. He saw some of the work of Michelangelo, and caught
the fever of art. He studied the cartoon for The Battle of Pisa, and was
so impressed by it that even the Sistine Chapel ceiling seemed to him
less marvelous. Against his father’s pleading he apprenticed himself to
a goldsmith, but in filial compromise he continued to practise the hated
flute. In Filippino Lippi’s house he found a book of drawings
representing the art antiquities of Rome. He burned with desire to see
those renowned exemplars with his own eyes, and often he talked with his
friends about going to the capital. One day he and a young woodcarver,
Giambattista Tasso, walking aim- lessly and talking passionately, found
themselves at the gate San Piero Gat- tolini; Benvenuto remarked that he
felt himself already halfway from Flor- ence to Rome; on a mutual dare
they walked on, mile after mile, until they reached Siena, thirty- three
miles away. There Gian’s feet rebelled. Cellini had money enough to hire
a horse; the two youths rode the one animal, and, “singing and laughing,
we traveled the whole way to Rome. I had just nineteen years then, and
so had the century.” 36</p>
<p>In Rome he found work as a goldsmith, studied the ancient remains,
and earned enough to send his father consolatory sums. But the doting
father pled so earnestly for his return that after two years Benvenuto
went back to Florence. He had hardly domiciled himself there when he
stabbed a youth in a quarrel. Thinking he had killed him, he fled again
to Rome (1521). He pored over Michelangelo’s paintings in the Sistine
Chapel, Raphael’s in the Villa Chigi and the Vatican; he noted all
interesting forms and lines in men and women, metals and foliage; soon
he was the best gold- smith in Rome. Clement took to him first as a
flutist, then discovered his excellence in design. Cellini made such
handsome coins for him that the Pope appointed him “stamp master of the
papal mint”— i.e., designer of currency for the Papal States. E ach
cardinal had a seal, sometimes “as large as the head of a twelve-year-
old child,” which was used to impress the wax that sealed a letter; some
such seals were worth a hundred crowns (250?).</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 707</p>
<p>Cellini engraved seals and coins, cut and set gems, modeled
medallions, enameled cameos, made a hundred varieties of objects in
silver and gold. These “various departments of art,” he writes, “are
very different from one another, so that a man who excels in one of
them, if he undertakes another, hardly ever achieves the same success;
whereas I strove with all my power to become equally versed in all of
them; and in the proper place I shall demonstrate that I attained my
object.” 37</p>
<p>Benvenuto brags on almost every page, but with such consistency and
ardor that at last we come to believe him. He speaks of his “fine
physiog - nomy and bodily symmetry,” and we cannot deny it. “Nature
bestowed</p>
<p>We glimpse the lawlessness of Italian city life in the sixteenth
century when we note with what easy conscience Cellini overrode the
command- ments of Church and state. Apparently the policing of Rome was
lax and fragmentary; a man of strong instincts could be — sometimes had
to be — a law unto himself. When provoked Benvenuto “felt a fever” which
“would have been my death had I not resolved to give it vent”; 39 when
offended “I thought I ought to act as well as intone my misereres”™ He
fell into a hundred quarrels, and, he assures us, was in the right in
all but one. He stuck a dagger into the neck of one offender, and with
such matador pre- cision that the man fell dead. 41 In another case “I
stabbed him just beneath</p>
<p>His theology was as independent as his morality. Since he was always
right (but once), he felt that God must be on his side, giving more
power to his arm; he prayed to God for aid in his murders, and gave Him
due credit for his success. However, when God failed to answer his
prayers to help him find his lost love Angelica, he turned to devils for
supplementary aid. A Sicilian sorcerer took him to the deserted
Colosseum at night, drew a magic circle in the ground, lit a fire,
sprinkled perfumes on the flames, and with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin
invocations summoned demons to ap- pear. Benvenuto was sure that
hundreds of phantoms rose before him, and</p>
<p>7°8 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>hat they predicted his early reunion with Angelica. He returned to
his house, and spent the rest of the night seeing devils. 48</p>
<p>When the imperial army sacked Rome Cellini fled to the Castel
Sant’</p>
<p>same authority that when Clement returned to Rome he made Cellini a
mace- bearer with a salary of 200 crowns (500?) a year, and said: “Were
I but a wealthy emperor, I would give Benvenuto as much land as my eyes
could survey; yet, being now but a needy bankrupt, I will at any rate
give him bread enough to satisfy his need.” 44</p>
<p>Paul III continued Clement’s patronage. Probably exaggerating to his
heart’s delight, Cellini quotes Paul as saying, to one who protested his
lenience with the artist: “Know then th at men like Benvenuto, unique in
their profession, stand above the law; and how far more, then, he who
re- ceived the provocation I have heard of.” 45 But Paul’s son
Pierluigi, as reck - less a rascal as Benvenuto himself, turned the Pope
against the artist. Even Cellini’s arts proved inadequate to overcome
such influence, and in 1537 he abandoned his shop in Rome and made for
France. On the way he was handsomely entertained by Bembo at Padua, made
a small portrait of him, and was in return presented with horses for
himself and his two com- panions. They mounted and descended the
Grisons, and rode through Zurich, Lausanne, Geneva, and Lyons to Paris.
There too Benvenuto</p>
<p>found enemies. Giovanni de’ Rossi, Florentine painter, wanted no more
rivals fo r the King’s money; he put difficulties in the way of the
newcomer; and when at last Cellini got to Francis he found him
inextricably tangled in war. Ill and homesick, he climbed back over the
Alps, made a pilgrimage to Loreto, and crossed the Apennines to Rome. To
his dismay he found him- self accused by Pierluigi of having embezzled
papal jewelry. He was flung into the same Castello that he had helped to
save, and suffered months of imprisonment. He escaped, but broke a leg
in the process; captured, he was confined in an underground dungeon for
two years. He was released at the request of Francis I, who now urgently
solicited his services in France. Once more he clambered over the Alps
(1540).</p>
<p>He found King and court at Fontana Belio — i.e., Fontainebleau; was
warmly welcomed, and was assigned a castle in Paris for his workshop and
home. When its occupants refused to leave he expelled them by force. The
French did not like his manners or his language, and Mme d’Ltampes,
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 709</p>
<p>King’s mistress, resented Cellini’s lack of courtesy to her high
estate. When</p>
<p>One of the dispossessed tenants sued him in court on a charge of
stealing some effects. The court decided against Cellini. He reversed
the judgment in his own striking way:</p>
<p>When I perceived that my cause had been unjustly lost, I had re-</p>
<p>course for my defense to a great dagger which I carried; for I
have</p>
<p>always taken pleasure in keeping fine weapons. The first man I
at-</p>
<p>acked was the plaintiff who had sued me; and one evening I</p>
<p>wounded him in the legs and anns so severely, taking care, however,
not to kill him, that I deprived him of the use of both his legs. 48</p>
<p>Apparently the plaintiff dared not press the matter further, and
Cellini could turn his energies to other outlets. He had in his Paris
studio “a poor young girl, Caterina; I keep her principally for my art’s
sake, since I cannot do without a model; but being a man also, I have
used her for my pleas- ure.” 49 However Caterina, with yielding
largesse, slept also with his helper, Pagolo Micceri. Benvenuto,
learning of it, beat her till he was exhausted. His servant Roberta
reproved him for punishing so violently so ordinary an incident; did he
not know that “there’s not a husband in France without’ horns”? The next
day he modeled from Caterina again, “during which oc - curred some
amorous diversions; and at last, on the same hour as on the previous
day, she irritated me to such a pitch that I gave her the same drub-
bing. So we went on for several days, repeating the same round….
Meanwhile I completed my work in a style which did me the greatest
credit.” 40 Another model, ’Jeanne, presented him with a daugh ter; he
settled a dowry on the mother, “and from that time I had nothing more to
do with her.” 41 The child was later smothered by its nurse.</p>
<p>Francis bore patiently with all this lawlessness; but finally
Benvenuto had so many enemies in Paris that he begged the King’s
permission to visit Italy. Consent was not given, but Cellini took
French leave, and, after an arduous trip, found himself in his native
Florence ( 1 545). There he showed</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>710</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>a better side of his nature, contributing materially to the support
of his sister and her six daughters. He found Cosimo less openhanded
than Francis. He made the usual enemies, but he cast a good portrait
bust of the Duke (in the Bargello), and produced for him his most
celebrated work — the Perseus that still stands in the Loggia dei Lanzi.
He tells a vivid story of the casting. His anxieties, toil, and exposure
to heat and cold culminated in a severe fever that compelled him to take
to his bed just when the furnace that he had designed especially for
this work was melting the metal, and this proved insufficient to fill
the gigantic mold. The labor of months was about to be spoiled when
Cellini rose from his bed and threw into the furnace a block of tin and
two hundred pewter vessels. These proved enough; the casting was a
complete success; and when the work was exposed to public view ( 1 5 54)
it was praised as highly as any statue made in Florence since
Michelangelo’s David; even Bandinelli said a good word for it.</p>
<p>From this climax the story descends to prosaic pages of haggling with
the Duke about the fee for the Perseus. Benvenuto was long on expecta-
tions, Cosimo was short of funds. The narrative abruptly ends at 1562.
It does not mention the fact, otherwise fairly well established, that in
1556 Benvenuto was twice imprisoned, apparently on charges of criminal
im- morality. 52 In these late years Cellini composed a treatise on the
gold- smith’s art —Trattato… dell’’ Orificeria. Having sown wild oats
for half a century, he married in 1564, and had two legitimate children
to add to one illegitimate child begotten in France and five generated
in Florence after his return.</p>
<p>Of his works — usually small enough to be readily movable — only a
few ca n now be located and identified. The Treasury of St. Peter’s has
an ornate silver candelabrum attributed to Cellini; the Bargello
preserves his Narcissus and his Ganymede, both in marble, and both
excellent; the Pitti has a salver and a pitcher in silver; the Louvre
has his fine medallion of Bembo, and a lovely bronze relief called The
Nymph of Fontainebleau; Vienna claims the saltcellar made for Francis I;
the Gardner Collection in Boston has his bust of Altoviti; his large
Crucifixion is in the Escorial. These scattered specimens hardly equip
us to judge Cellini as an artist; they seem too slight for his fame, and
even the Perseus, violent and overwrought, inclines to the baroque. Yet
Clement VII (we have it on Benvenuto’s</p>
<p>word) rated him as “the greatest artist in his craft who was ever
born”; 53 and an extant letter of Michelangelo to Cellini reads: “I have
known you all these years as the greatest goldsmith of whom the world
has ever</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 71 1</p>
<p>heard.” 54 We may conclude that Cellini was a genius and a ruffian, a
master craftsman and a murderer, whose spirited Autobiography outshines
his silver and gold and cameos, and reconciles us to the morals of our
time.</p>

<li>LESSER LIGHTS</li>
</ol>
<p>This age of decline for Italy was a resurrection for Savoy. As a lad
of eight Emmanuel Philibert might have seen the French invade and
conquer the duchy (1536). At twenty-five he inherited its crown but not
its soil; at twenty-nine he played a leading part in the victory of the
Spanish and the English over the French at St. Quentin (1557); and two
years later France surrendered to him his ruined country and bankrupt
throne. His regeneration of Savoy and Pied- mont was a masterpiece of
statesmanship. The Alpine slopes of his duchy were the haunts of Vaudois
heretics, who were progressively transforming Catholic churches into
whitewashed conventicles of Calvinist worship. Pope Pius IV offered him
a year’s ecclesiastical revenues to suppress the sect; Emmanuel took
some drastic measures; but when these resulted in large-scale emigration
he turned to a policy of tolerance, checked the ardor of the
Inquisition, and gave asylum to Huguenot refugees. He founded a new
university at Turin, and financed the compilation of an encyclopedia —
Teatro universale di tutte le scienze. He was always courteous, and
repeatedly unfaithful, to his wife, Margaret of Valois, who gave him
wise counsel and diplomatic aid, and who presided over the bright social
and intellectual life of Turin. When Emmanuel died (1580) his duchy was
one of the best-governed lands in Europe. From his line in the
nineteenth century would come the kings of united Italy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Andrea Doria, who in the late wars had passed from the
French to the Spanish side with timely treachery, maintained his
leadership in Genoa. The bankers there had helped to finance the
campaigns of Charles V, who repaid them by leaving undisturbed their
domination of the city. Not as badly hurt as Venice by the movement of
commerce out of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic, Genoa became again
a great port and strategic citadel. Galeazzo Alessi of Perugia, a pupil
of Michelangelo, built sumptuous churches and palaces in Genoa. Vasari
described the Via Balbi as the most splendid street in Italy.*</p>
<p>When Francesco Maria Sforza, last of his line as rulers, died in
1535, Charles V appointed an imperial vicar to govern Milan. Subjection
brought peace, and the ancient city prospered once more. Alessi built
there the handsome Palazzo Marino; and Leone Leoni, engraver in the
Milan mint, rivaled Cellini in the miniature plastic arts, but found no
Cellini to publish his excellence. The most distinguished Milanese of
the age was San Carlo Borromeo, who re-enacted at</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>he close of the Renaissance the role played by St. Ambrose in the
decline of antiquity. He came of a rich patrician family; his uncle Pius
IV made him a cardinal at twenty-one, and archbishop of Milan at
twenty-two (1560). He was probably at that time the richest prelate in
Christendom. But he renounced all his benefices except the
archbishopric, gave the proceeds to charity, and consumed himself in
almost fanatical devotion to the Church. He founded the order of Oblates
of St. Ambrose, brought the Jesuits into Milan, and vigorously supported
all movements for ecclesiastical reform that remained loyal to Ca-
tholicism. Accustomed to wealth and power, he insisted on the full
medieval jurisdiction of his episcopal court, took into his hands much
of the work of maintaining law and order, filled his archiepiscopal
dungeons with criminals and heretics, and for twenty-four years was the
real ruler of the city. Literature and art suffered under his passion
for conformity and morality; but Pellegrino Tibaldi, architect and
painter, flourished under his patronage, and designed the grandiose
choir of the great cathedral. All the cardinal’s severity was forgiven
when, in the plague of 1576, while most notables fled, he stayed at his
post and comforted the sick and bereaved with tireless visits, vigils,
and prayers.</p>
<p>At Cernobbio, on Lake Como, Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio, perhaps not sure
of another heaven, built the Villa d’Este (1568). At Brescia
Giambattista Moroni, pupil of Moretto, painted some portraits worthy to
stand beside most of Titian’s.* In Cremona Vincenzo Campi carried on the
family tradition of painting less than immortal pictures. At Ferrara
Ercole II compromised the long quarrel of his state with the papacy by
paying Paul III 1 80,000 ducats, and pledging 7,000 ducats tribute per
year. Alfonso II gave the city another era of prosperity (1558-97),
which culminated in the Gerusalemme liberata of Tor- quato Tasso and the
Pastor fido of Giovanni Guarini. Girolamo da Carpi learned the art of
painting from Garofolo, but (Vasari says) spent too much time on love
and the lute, and married too soon, to indulge himself in the self-
centeredness of genius.</p>
<p>Piacenza and Parma rose to excited prominence in this age. Though
they had for centuries belonged to Milan, and that duchy was now a
dependency of Charles V, Pope Paul III claimed the two cities as papal
fiefs, and invested his son Pierluigi Farnese with them in 1545. Not
quite two years later the new duke was assassinated at Piacenza by a
revolt of nobles reconciled to his lechery but resenting his monopoly of
power and plums. Paul rightly ascribed the initiative in the conspiracy
to Ferrante Gonzaga, then ruling Milan as vicar for Charles; and noted
that imperial troops, providentially at hand, at once took possession of
Piacenza for the Emperor (1547). Soon after Paul’s death Julius</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 7 1 3</p>
<p>III appointed Pierluigi’s son Ottavio Duke of Parma; and as O ttavio
was also Charles’s son -in-law, he was allowed to rule Parma till his
death (1586).</p>
<p>No decline was visible in Bologna. Here Vignola designed the Portico
de’ Banchi for a group of traders; Antonio Morandi added to the
University an Archiginnasio famous for its noble cortile; and Sebastiano
Serlio wrote an architectural treatise that rivaled Palladio’s in
influence. In 1563 Pope Pius IV commissioned Tommaso Laureti of Palermo
to set up a fountain in the Piazza di San Petronio. The sculptural part
of the undertaking was offered to a young Flemish artist, who now came
from Florence and perhaps received his name from the city in which he
produced his greatest work. Giovanni da Bologna, or Gian Bologna, molded
nine figures for the immense Fontana di Nettuno. At the summit of the
group he raised a gigantic god of the waters, naked and strong; on the
corners of the basin he cast in bronze four happy children in a game
with leaping dolphins; at the feet of Neptune he placed four graceful
maidens squeezing streams of water from their breasts. Bologna sent Gian
back to Florence with florins and praise, and did not grudge the 70,000
florins (75,- 000? ) that it had spent on the magnificent fountain. The
spirit of civic art was still alive in Italy.</p>
<p>As we take our parting look at Renaissance Rome, we are struck by the
rapidity of her recovery from the disaster of 1527. Clement VII had
shown more skill in remedying the ruin than in preventing it. His
surrender to Charles had saved the Papal States, and their revenues
helped the papacy to finance the restoration of Church discipline and
the partial reconstruction of Rome. The full effect of the Reformation
in reduced income was not yet felt in the papal treasury; and under Paul
III the spirit and splendor of the Renaissance seemed for a moment
revived.</p>
<p>Some arts were dying, others were being bom or changing form. Giulio
Clovio, a Croatian domiciled with Cardinal Famese, was almost the last
of the great illuminators of manuscripts. But in 1567 Claudio Monteverdi
was bom at Cremona; soon opera and oratorio would be added to the arts;
and the polyphonic masses of Palestrina were already celebrating the
reinvigoration of the Church. The great age of Italian painting was
ending; Perino del Vaga and Giovanni da Udine, epigoni of Raphael,
turned the art toward decoration. Sculpture was becoming baroque;
Raffaello da Montelupo and Giovanni da Montorsoli exaggerated the
exaggerations of their master Michelangelo, and produced statues with
limbs contorted into original but bizarre and ungainly poses.</p>
<p>Architecture was now the most flourishing of the arts. The Famese
Palace and Gardens on the Palatine were improved by Michelangelo (1547)
and completed by Giacomo della Porta (1580). Antonio da Sangallo the
Younger</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>7H</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>designed the Pauline Chapel of the Vatican (1540). In the Sala Regia
— leading to the Pauline and Sistine Chapels — Pope Paul III had the
marble floor and paneling designed by this Sangallo, the walls frescoed
by Vasari and the Zuccari brothers, the ceiling beautifully carved in
stucco by Daniele da Volterra and Perino del Vaga. The papal apartments
in Sant’ Angelo were embellished with frescoes and carvings by Perino,
Giulio Romano, and Giovanni da Udine. The second Cardinal Ippolito
d’Este built near Tivoli (1549) the earlier of two</p>
<p>The most popular architect in or about Rome in this age was Giacomo
Barozzi da Vignola. Coming from Bologna to study the classic ruins, he
formed his style by marrying the Pantheon of Agrippa to the Basilica of
Julius Caesar, seeking to combine cupola and arches, columns and
pediments; and, like Pal- ladio, he wrote a book to propagate his
principles. He achieved his first triumph at Caprarola, near Viterbo, by
designing for Cardinal Farnese another vast and luxurious Palazzo
Farnese (1547-9); and ten years later he built a third at Piacenza. But
his most influential work was done at Rome in the Villa di Papa Giulio
for Pope Julius III, the Porta del Popolo, and the church of the Gesu
(1568-75). In this famous edifice, built for the rising Jesuits, Vignola
designed a nave of impressive breadth and height, and converted the
aisles into chapels; later architects would make this church the first
clear manifestation of the baroque style — curved or contorted forms
surfeited with ornament. In 1564 Vignola succeeded Michelangelo as chief
architect at St. Peter’s, and shared in the honor of raising the great
dome that Angelo had designed.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>MICHELANGELO: THE LAST PHASE: 1 5 34-64</li>
</ol>
<p>Through all these years Michelangelo had survived as an unruly ghost
from another age. He was fifty-nine when Clement died, but no one seemed
to think that he had earned the right to rest. Paul III and Francesco
Maria of Urbino fought over his living body. The Duke, as executor for
Julius II, clamored for completion of his uncle’s tomb, and flourished a
contract long since signed by Angelo. But the imperious pontiff would
not hear of it. “For thirty years,” said Paul to Buonarroti, “I have
wanted</p>
<p>mausoleum than Julius had dreamed of. The knowledge that the tomb w
as an abortion shared in darkening the Titan’s later years.</p>
<p>In 1535 the triumphant Pope issued a brief appointing
Michelangelo</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 7 1 5</p>
<p>chief architect, sculptor, and painter at the Vatican, and
proclaiming his eminence in each field. The artist was made a member of
the papal house- hold, and was given a life pension of 1200 crowns
(5,000?) a year. Clement VII, shortly before his death, had asked him to
paint a fresco of The Last Judgment behind the altar of the Sistine
Chapel. Paul proposed that this commission should now be carried out.
Michael was reluctant; he wanted to carve, not paint; he was happier
with hammer and chisel than with the brush. The very size of the wall to
be painted — sixty-six by thirty-three feet — might have given him
pause. Nevertheless in Septem- ber, 1535, aged sixty, he began his most
famous picture.</p>
<p>Perhaps the repeated frustrations of his life — the maimed mausoleum
of Julius, the destruction of his statue of that pope at Bologna, the
unfinished facade of San Lorenzo, the unfinished Medici tombs — had
accumulated in him a bitterness that poured itself into this
consummation of divine wrath. Memories of Savonarola may have come back
to him across forty years — those dire prophecies of doom, those
denunciations of human wickedness, clerical corruption, Medicean
tyranny, intellectual pride, and pagan joys, those blasts of hell-fire
searing the soul of Florence; now the dead martyr would speak again,
from the most intimate altar in Christendom. The somber artist whom
Leonardo had called learned in Dante would soak him- self anew in the
brine of the Inferno, and put its horrors on the wall where for
generations to come future popes might have that inescapable judgment
before them as they read the Mass. And meanwhile, in this citadel of a
religion that had till lately scorned and maligned the human body, he
would be a sculptor even with the brush, and would paint that body in a
hundred conditions and attitudes, in the contortions and grimaces of
agony, in the drowsy then excited resurrection of the dead, in inflated
angels blow- ing the fateful summons, in a Christ still showing His
wounds, yet strong enough, with His titanic shoulders and Herculean
arms, to hurl into hell those who had thought themselves superior to the
commandments of God.</p>
<p>The sculptor in him ruined the painting. This stem puritan, who day
by day became more religious, insisted on carving in color massive and
mus- cular bodies, until the angels that art and poetry had conceived as
happy children, gracious youths, or lithesome girls, became in his hands
athletes racing through the skies, and damned and saved alike were
worthy of salvation if only because they were made in the image and
likeness of God, and even Christ Himself, in His majestic anger, became
an incarnation of the Adam of the Sistine ceiling, a god made in the
image and likeness of man. There is too much flesh here, there are too
many arms and legs, biceps</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>716</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>and swelling calves, to lift the spirit to contemplate the wages of
sin. Even the lecherous Aretino thought these pullulating nudes were a
bit out of place. Everyone knows how Paul Ill’s master of ceremonies,
Biagio da Cesena, complained that such a celebration of the human form
would more fitly adorn a wineshop than the chapel of the popes; how
Michelangelo avenged himself by painting Biagio among the damned; and
how Paul, when Biagio begged him to order the erasure of the portrait,
replied with excellent humor and theology that not even a pope can
release a soul from hell. 58 Yielding to protests like Biagio’s, Paul IV
bade Daniele da Volterra</p>
<p>After six years of labor the picture was unveiled for the Christmas
cele- bration of 1541. A Rome now entering upon a religious reaction
against the Renaissance accepted The Last Judgment as good theology and
great art. Vasari pronounced it the most wonderful of all paintings.
Artists ad- mired the anatomy, and were not offended by the muscular
exaggerations, the bizarre attitudes, the carnal excess; on the contrary
many painters imi- tated these mannerisms of the Master, and formed the
mannerist school that began the decadence of Italian art. Even laymen
marveled at the fore- shortenings — which gave parts of the picture the
semblance of relief — and the acute sense of perspective that had made
the lower figures two meters in height, the middle figures three, the
upper figures four. We who view the fresco today cannot judge it fairly;
it has been injured by Daniele’s tailoring, a further draping of some
figures in 1762, and the dust and candle smoke and natural darkening of
four centuries.</p>
<p>After some months of rest Michelangelo began (1542) work on two</p>
<p>frescoes in the chapel that Antonio da Sangallo had built in the
Vatican for Paul III. One represented the martyrdom of St. Peter, the
other the conversion of St. Paul. Here again the aging artist lost
himself in violent exaggerations of the human form. He was seventy-five
when he completed these pictures, and he told Vasari that he painted
them against his will, and with great effort and fatigue. 57</p>
<p>He did not feel too old for sculpture; indeed, he said, the hammer
and chisel kept him in health. Even during the painting of The Last
Judgment he had sought refuge and consolation now and then with the
marbles in his studio. In 1539 he carved his stem and powerful Brutus
(in the Bar-</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>gello), worthy of the greatest Roman portrait sculpture. Perhaps he
meant it to sanction the recent tyrannicide of Alessandro de’ Medici in
Florence, and to serve as a reminder to future despots. Eleven years
later, in a tenderer mood, he carved the Pietci that stands behind the
high altar of the Florentine cathedral. He hoped to make this his own
sepulchral monu- ment, and he worked on it feverishly, often continuing
his labor on it at night by the light of a candle fixed in his cap. But
an overfurious blow of the hammer so injured the statue that he
abandoned it as irrevocably spoiled. His servant Antonio Mini begged it
as a gift, received it, and sold it to a Florentine. It is an
astonishing product for a man of seventy-five years. The body of the
dead Christ is represented without exaggeration; the figure of Mary,
unfinished, is tenderness petrified; and the noble face of the hooded
Nicodemus could well portray, as some have thought, Mi- chelangelo
himself, who now so often meditated on the Passion of Christ.</p>
<p>His religion was essentially medieval, darkened with mysticism,
proph- ecy, and the thought of death and hell; he did not share the
skepticism of Leonardo or the blithe indifference of Raphael; his
favorite books were the Bible and Dante. Toward the end of his life his
poetry turned more and more on religion:</p>
<p>Now hath my life across a stormy sea,</p>
<p>Like a frail bark, reached that wide port where all</p>
<p>Are bidden, ere the final judgment fall,</p>
<p>Of good and evil deeds to pay the fee.</p>
<p>Now know I well how that fond phantasy,</p>
<p>Which made my soul the worshiper and thrall</p>
<p>Of earthly art, is vain; how criminal</p>
<p>Is that which all men seek so willingly.</p>
<p>These amorous thoughts which were so lightly dressed —</p>
<p>What are they when the double death is nigh?</p>
<p>The one I know for sure, the other dread.</p>
<p>Painting nor sculpture now can lull to rest</p>
<p>My soul, that turns to His great love on high,</p>
<p>Whose arms to clasp us on the cross are spread. 58</p>
<p>The old poet reproached himself for having composed in past years
some sonnets to love. But these were apparently poetic exercises rather
than passions of the flesh. The sincerest sonnets in Michelangelo’s Rime
are ad - dressed to an elderly widow or a handsome youth. Tommaso
Cavalieri was a Roman noble who played at painting. He came to Angelo (
c. 1532) for instruction, and bewitched his teacher with the beauty of
his face and form,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>718</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>he grace of his carriage and manners. Michael fell in love with him,
and wrote to him sonnets of such frank admiration that some have been
led to place Michelangelo with Leonardo among the famous homosexuals of
his- tory. 58 “ Such fond expressions of man to man were common in the
Renais- sance, even among assiduous heterosexuals; their extreme
language was part of the poetic and epistolary ritual of the time; we
can draw no conclusions from them. We note, however, that — outside of
poetry — Michelangelo seems to have been indifferent to women until he
met Vittoria Colonna.</p>
<p>His friendship with her began about 1542, when she was fifty and he
was sixty-seven. A woman of fifty can easily stir the embers of a sex-
agenarian, but Vittoria had no mind for it; she felt herself still bound
to the Marquis of Pescara, now seventeen years dead. “Our friendship is
stable,” she wrote to Michelangelo, “and our affection very sure; it is
tied with a Christian knot.” 59 She sent him 143 sonnets, good but
negligible; he replied in sonnets warm with admiration and devotion, but
tarnished with literary conceits. When they met they talked about art
and religion, and perhaps she confessed to him her sympathy with the men
who were try- ing to reform the Church. Her influence upon him was
profound; all the finest spiritual elements of life seemed gathered up
in her piety, kindness, and fidelity. Something of his pessimism cleared
away when she walked and talked with him; and he prayed that he might
never again be the man he had been before they met. He was with her when
she died ( 1 547). For a long time thereafter he remained “downstricken
as if deranged,” and he reproached himself for not having kissed her
face as well as her hand in those last moments. 40</p>
<p>It was shortly before her death that he assumed his last and greatest
re- sponsibility in art. When Antonio da Sangallo passed away
(1546),</p>
<p>Paul III asked Michelangelo to undertake the completion of
St. Peter’s. The weary artist protested again that he was a sculptor,
not an architect; perhaps he had not forgotten his failure with the
fagade of San Lorenzo. The Pope insisted, and Angelo yielded with
“infinite regret”; but, Vasari adds, “I believe His Holiness was
inspired by God.” For this cu lminating task of his career the artist
refused additional remuneration, though the Pope repeatedly pressed it
upon him. He set to work with an energy hardly to be expected of a man
in his seventy-second year.</p>
<p>As if St. Peter’s were not burden enough he took upon himself in the
same year two other major enterprises. To the Palazzo Farnese he added a
third story, a cornice acclaimed by all for its beauty, and the two
upper tiers of a court that Vasari judged the finest cortile in Europe.
He designed</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 719</p>
<p>a spacious flight of steps to the top of the Capitoline hill, and
placed on the summit the ancient equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius.
Later, aged eighty-eight, he began to erect at the farther end of this
plateau the Palazzo del Senatore, with its lordly double staircase; and
he drew up plans for the Palazzo dei Conservatori at one side of the
Senate Hall, and the Museo Capitolino at the other. Even he could not
live long enough to carry out alb these plans, but the structures were
completed on his designs by Tom- maso Cavalieri, Vignola, and Giacomo
della Porta.</p>
<p>When Paul III died (1549) some doubt arose whether his successor,</p>
<p>Julius III, would continue Angelo as architect-in-chief at St. Pet
er’s.</p>
<p>Michael had rejected Antonio da Sangallo’s plan as making for so dark
a church that (he said) it would have been dangerous to public morals.
61 The dead man’s friends persuaded two cardinals to warn the Pope
that</p>
<p>diameter and 1 5 1 feet in its own height, with its apex 3 34 feet
from the ground; it was to rest on a corniced base upheld by four
gigantic arches at the transept crossing of the church. A “lantern” or
open -faced smaller cupola was to rise sixty-nine feet above the main
dome, and a cross was to reach thirty-two feet higher still as the
pinnacle of the whole majestic edifice, 435 feet in total height. The
comparable dome that Brunellesco had raised over the cathedral of
Florence, and whose beauty Michelangelo modestly pronounced
unsurpassable, measured 138% feet in width, 133 in its own height, 300
from ground to apex, 351 with its lantern. These two domes were the most
audacious undertakings in the history of Renaissance architecture.</p>
<p>Pius IV succeeded Paul IV in 1569. Once again the enemies of the</p>
<p>aging Titan sought to replace him. Worn out with a long war of
dispute</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>and recrimination, he submitted his resignation (1560). The Pope
refused to accept it, and Michelangelo continued as chief architect of
St. Peter’s till his death. Then it became clear that his critics had
not been wholly in the wrong. Just as in sculpture he often attacked the
marble block with no other preparation than an idea in his head, so in
architecture he seldom put his plans upon paper, rarely confided them
even to his friends, but merely made blueprints for each part of the
edifice as the time approached to build it. When he died he left no
definite plans or models for any portion except the dome. Consequently
his successors were free to adopt their own ideas. They changed his —
and Bramante’s— basic conception of a Greek cross to a Latin cross by
elongating the eastern arm of the church, and fronting it with a high
fagade that made the cupola invisible on that side except from a quarter
of a mile away. The only part of the building that is Angelo’s is the
cupola, which was erected from his plans, with no substantial change, by
Giacomo della Porta in 1588. It is unquestionably the noblest architec-
tural sight in Rome. Rising in stately curves from drum to lantern, it
crowns with majesty the immense pile beneath, and gives to classic
columns, pilasters, architraves, and pediments a comprehensive unity
rivaling in splendor any known structure of the ancient world. Here
again Christi- anity sought a reconciliation with antiquity: the temple
of the worship of Christ placed the dome of the Pantheon (142 feet wide
by 142 feet in total height) upon the Basilica of Constantine as
Bramante had vowed to do, and dared to raise classic columns to a lofty
stature unparalleled in the records of antiquity.</p>
<p>Michelangelo continued to work till his eighty-ninth year. In 1563,
at the request of Pius IV, he transformed a part of the Baths of
Diocletian into the church and convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli. He
designed the Porta Pia, one of the city gates. He made for the
Florentines in Rome a model for a church; Vasari, perhaps too
enthusiastic about his old teacher and friend, pronounced the proposed
building “as beautiful as ever man beheld”; 62 but Florentine fu nds in
Rome ran short, and the edifice was never built.</p>
<p>At last the Titan’s incredible energy failed. About his seventy
-third</p>
<p>year he had begun to suffer from the stone. He seems to have found
some palliative in medicine or mineral waters, but, he sai d, “I put
more faith in prayers than in medicines.” Twelve years later he wrote to
a nephew: “As regards my condition, I am ill with all the troubles that
are wont to afflict old men. The stone prevents me from passing water.
My loins and back</p>
<p>CHAP, xxni) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 721</p>
<p>are so stiff that I often cannot climb upstairs.” 63 Yet till his
ninetieth year</p>
<p>He took the approach of death with religious resignation and
philosophi- cal good humor. “I am so old,” he remarked to Vasari, “that
death often pulls me by the cape and bids me go with him.” 64 A famous
bronze relief by Daniele da Volterra shows a face lined with pain and
haggard with age. In February, 1564, he grew weaker day by day, and
spent most of the time sleeping in his old armchair. He made no will,
but merely “left his soul to God, his body to the earth, and his goods
to his nearest relations.” 65 He died on February 18, 1564, aged
eighty-nine. His body was taken to Florence and was buried in the church
of Santa Croce, with ceremonies that lasted several days. Vasari
devotedly designed for him a sumptuous tomb.</p>
<p>It was the judgment of some contemporaries, and has been the judgment
of time, that despite a multitude of defects he was the greatest artist
who ever lived. He exemplified fully the definition given by Ruskin of
“the greatest artist”— as he “who has embodied, in the sum of his works,
the greatest number of the greatest ideas”— i.e., ideas that “exercise
and exalt the highes t faculties of the mind.” 66 He was, to begin with,
a master drafts - man whose drawings were among the most treasured gifts
and thefts of his friends. We can see some of these drawings today in
the Casa Buonarroti at Florence or in the Cabinet des Dessins of the
Louvre: sketches for the fa§ade of San Lorenzo, or for The Last
Judgment, a lovely study for a sibyl, a St. Anne almost as subtly
conceived as Leonardo’s, and the strange drawing he made of Vittoria
Colonna dead, with mystic countenance and wasted breasts. In one of the
conversations reported by Francisco de Hollanda he reduced all arts to
design:</p>
<p>The science of design, or of fine drawing…. is the source and</p>
<p>very essence of painting, sculpture, architecture, and of every
form</p>
<p>of representation, as well too as of all the sciences. He who has
made himself a master in this art possesses a great treasure…. All
the</p>
<p>works of the human brain and hand are either design itself or a</p>
<p>branch of that art. 67</p>
<p>As a painter he remained a draftsman, far less interested in color
than in line, seeking above all to draw an expressive form, to fix in
art some human attitude, or to convey through a design a philosophy of
life. The hand was that of Pheidias or Apelles, the voice was Jeremiah’s
or Dante’s. On</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>722</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>one of his passages between Florence and Rome he must have stopped at
Orvieto and studied the nudes that Signorelli had painted there; these,
and the frescoes of Giotto and Masaccio, gave some hints to a style that
was nevertheless unlike anything else that history has preserved. Far
beyond and above the others, even beyond Leonardo, Raphael, and Titian,
he brought to his art, and brought out in his art, nobility. He did not
dally with decoration or triviality; he cared nothing for prettiness,
landscapes, architectural backgrounds, arabesques; he let his subject
stand out stark and unadorned. His mind was caught by a high vision, to
which he gave form, as well as the hand could, in the shape of sibyls,
prophets, saints, heroes, and gods. His art used the human body as its
medium, but those human forms were to him the tortured embodiments of
his hopes and terrors, his confused philosophy, and his smoldering
religious faith.</p>
<p>Sculpture was his favorite and characteristic art because it is the
pre- eminent art of form. He never colored his statues, feeling that
form was enough; even bronze had too much color for him, and he confined
his sculpture to marble. 68 Whatever he painted or built was sculptural,
even to St. Peter’s dome. He failed as an architect (barring that
sublime cupola) because he could hardly conceive a building except in
terms and propor- tions of the human body, and could barely suffer it to
be more than a re- ceptacle of statuary; he wanted to cover all
surfaces, instead of making surfaces an element of form. Sculpture was a
fever with him; the marble, he thought, obdurately hid a secret, which
he was resolved to extricate; but the secret was in himself, and was too
intimate for full revelation. Dona- tello helped him a little, della
Quercia more, the Greeks less, in the struggle to give the inner vision
outward form. He agreed with the Greeks in de- voting most of his art to
the body, leaving the faces generalized and almost stereotyped, as in
the female figures on the Medici tombs; but he never achieved — his
temper would not let him care for — the unimpassioned repose of Greek
statuary before the Hellenistic age. He had no use for a form that did
not express feeling. He lacked the classic restraint and sense of
proportion; he made shoulders too broad for the head, trunks too mighty
for the limbs, and limbs knotted with muscles, as if all men and gods
were wrestlers taut with strife. It must be admitted that in these
dramatic exag- gerations of effort and emotion the art of the mannerists
and the baroque was born.</p>
<p>Michelangelo did not found a school as Raphael did, but he trained
some distinguished artists, and wielded pervasive influence. One pupil,
Guglielmo della Porta, designed for Paul III, in St. Peter’s, a
mausoleum that could</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE WANING OF THE RENAISSANCE 723</p>
<p>almost bear comparison with the tombs of the Medici. But generally
the successors of Angelo in sculpture and painting imitated his excesses
without redeeming them with his depth of thought and feeling and his
technical mastery. Usually a supreme artist is the culmination of a
tradition, method, style, and historical mood; his very superiority
fulfills and exhausts a line of development, so that after him must come
a period of helpless imitation and decline. Then slowly a new mood and
tradition grow; a new concep- tion, ideal, or technique struggles
through a hundred bizarre experiments to find another discipline, some
original and freshly revealing form.</p>
<p>The last word must be one of humility. We middling mortals, even</p>
<p>while presuming to sit in judgment upon the gods, must not fail to
recog- nize their divinity. We need not be ashamed to worship heroes, if
our sense of discrimination is not left outside their shrines. We honor
Mi- chelangelo because through a long and tortured life he continued to
cre- ate, and produced in each main field a masterpiece. We see these
works tom, so to speak, out of his flesh and blood, out of his mind and
heart, leaving him for a time weakened with birth. We see them taking
form through a hundred thousand strokes of hammer and chisel, pencil and
brash; one after another, like an immortal population, they take their
place among the lasting shapes of beauty or significance. We cannot know
what God is, nor understand a universe so mingled of apparent evil and
good, of suffering and loveliness, destruction and sublimity; but in the
presence of a mother tending her child, or of a genius giving order to
chaos, meaning to matter, nobility to form or thought, we feel as close
as we shall ever be to the life and mind and law that constitute the
unintelligible intelligence of the world.</p>
<p>Envoi</p>
<p>I T has been a profound and grateful experience to study so many of
the phases and personalities of these rich and vibrant centuries. How
end- less was the wealth of this Renaissance, which even in its waning
produced men like Tintoretto and Veronese, Aretino and Vasari, Paul III
and Pales- trina, Sansovino and Palladio, Duke Cosimo and Cellini, and
such art as the rooms of the Ducal Palace and St. Peter’s dome! What
frightening vitality there must have been in those Renaissance Italians,
living amid violence, seduction, superstition, and war, yet eagerly
alive to every form of beauty and artistry, and pouring forth — as if
all Italy had been a volcano — the hot lava of their passions and their
art, their architecture and assassinations, their sculpture and
liaisons, their painting and brigandage, their Madonnas and grotesques,
their hymns and macaronic verse, their obscenities and piety, their
profanity and prayers! Has there ever been elsewhere such depth and
intensity of Yea-saying life? To this day we feel the lifting breath of
that afflatus, and our museums overflow with the spared surplus of that
inspired and frenzied age.</p>
<p>It is difficult to judge it calmly, and we grudgingly rehearse the
charges that have been brought against it. First of all, the Renaissance
(limiting that term to Italy) was based materially upon the economic
exploitation of the simple many by the clever few. The wealth of papal
Rome came from the pious pennies of a million European homes; the
splendor of Flor- ence was the transmuted sweat of lowly proletaires who
worked long hours, had no political rights, and were better off than
medieval serfs only in sharing in the proud glory of civic art and the
exciting stimulus of city life. Politically the Renaissance was the
replacement of republican com- munes with mercantile oligarchies and
military dictatorships. Morally it was a pagan revolt that sapped the
theological supports of the moral code, and left human instincts grossly
free to use as they pleased the new wealth of commerce and industry.
Unchecked by censorship from a Church her- self secularized and martial,
the state declared itself above morality in government, diplomacy, and
war.</p>
<p>Renaissance art (the indictment continues) was beautiful, but seldom
sublime. It excelled Gothic art in detail, but fell short of it in
grandeur,</p>
<p>7 2 4</p>
<p>ENVOI</p>
<p>725</p>
<p>unity, and total effect; it rarely reached Greek perfection or Roman
maj- esty. It was the voice of an aristocracy of wealth that divorced
the artist from the artisan, uprooted him from the people, and made him
dependent upon upstart princes and rich men. It lost its soul to a dead
antiquity, and enslaved architecture and sculpture to ancient and alien
forms. What an absurdity it was to put false Greco-Roman fronts upon
Gothic churches, as Alberti did in Florence and Rimini! Perhaps the
whole classical revival in art was a grievous mistake. A style once dead
cannot properly be re- vitalized unless the civilization that it
expressed can be restored; the vigor and health of the style lie in its
harmony with the life and culture of its time. There was, in the great
age of Greek and Roman art, a stoic re- straint idealized by Greek
thought and often realized in Roman character; but that restraint was
quite foreign to the Renaissance spirit of freedom, passion, turbulence,
and excess. What could be more contrary to the Italian temper in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries than the flat roof and ceiling, the
regular rectangular fagade, the dreary rows of identical win- dows, that
stigmatized the Renaissance palace? When Italian architecture tired of
this monotony and artificial classicism, it let itself go, like a Ve-
netian merchant robed for Titian, in excessive ornament and splendor,
and fell from the classic into the baroque — corruptio optimi
pessima.</p>
<p>Neither could classic sculpture express the Renaissance. For
restraint is essential to sculpture; the enduring medium does not fitly
embody a con- tortion or an agony that by its nature must be brief.
Sculpture is motion immobilized, passion spent or controlled, beauty or
form preserved from time by metal congealed or lasting stone. Perhaps
for this reason the greatest sculptures of the Renaissance are mostly
tombs or pietcls, in which restless man has at last achieved
tranquillity. Donatello, try as he might to be classic, remained
striving, aspiring, Gothic; Michelangelo was a law to himself, a Titan
imprisoned in his temperament, struggling through Slaves and Captives to
find esthetic peace, but ever too lawless and excited for repose. The
recovered classic heritage was a burden as well as a boon; it enriched
the modem soul with noble exemplars, but it almost smothered that
youthful spirit — just come of age — under a falling multitude of
columns, capitals, architraves, and pediments. Perhaps this resurrected
antiquity, this idolatry of proportion and symmetry (even in gardens),
halted the growth of a native and congenial art, precisely as the
revival of Latin by the hu- manists impeded the development of
literature in the vernacular.</p>
<p>Renaissance painting succeeded in expressing the color and passion of
the time, and brought the art to a technical refinement never
surpassed.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>726</p>
<p>But it too had its faults. Its stress was on sensuous beauty, on
lordly raiment and rosy flesh; even its religious pictures were a
voluptuous senti- mentality, more intent upon corporeal forms than upon
spiritual sig- nificance; and many a medieval crucifix reaches deeper
into the soul than the demure Virgins of Renaissance art. Flemish and
Dutch artists dared to picture unattractive faces and homely dress, and
to seek behind these sim- ple features the secrets of character and the
elements of life. How super- ficial the nudes of Venice — even the
Madonnas of Raphael — seem beside the Van Eycks’ Adoration of the Lamb!
Raphael’s Julius II is unexcelled, but is there anything in the hundred
self-portraits by Italian artists that can compare with Rembrandt’s
honest mirrorings of himself? The popularity of portraiture in the
sixteenth century suggests the rise of the nouveaux riches, and their
hunger to see themselves in the glass of fame. The Renais- sance was a
brilliant age, but through all its manifestations runs a strain of show
and insincerity, a flaunting of costly costumes, a hollow fabric of
precarious power unsupported by inner strength, and ready to fall into
ruins at the touch of a merciless rabble, or at the distant cry of an
obscure and angry monk.</p>
<p>Well, what shall we say to this harsh indictment of an epoch that we
have loved with all the enthusiasm of youth? We shall not try to refute
that indictment: though it is weighted with unfair comparisons, much of
it is true. Refutations never convince, and to pit one half-truth
against its opposite is vain unless the two can be merged into a larger
and juster view. Of course the Renaissance culture was an aristocratic
superstructure raised upon the backs of the laboring poor; but, alas,
what culture has not been? Doubtless much of the literature and art
could hardly have arisen without some concentration of wealth; even for
righteous writers unseen toilers mine the earth, grow food, weave
garments, and make ink. We shall not defend the despots; some of them
deserved a Borgian garroting; many of them wasted in vain luxury the
revenues drawn from their people; but neither shall we apologize for
Cosimo and his grandson Lorenzo, whom the Florentines obviously
preferred to a chaotic plutocracy. As for the moral laxity, it was the
price of intellectual liberation; and heavy as the price was, that
liberation is the invaluable birthright of the modern world, the very
breath of our spirits today.</p>
<p>The devoted scholarship that resurrected classic letters and
philosophy was chiefly the work of Italy. There the first modern
literature arose, out of that resurrection and that liberation; and
though no Italian writer of the age could match Erasmus or Shakespeare,
Erasmus himself yearned for the</p>
<p>ENVOI</p>
<p>727</p>
<p>clear free air of Renaissance Italy, and the England of Elizabeth
owed to Italy — to “Englishmen Italianate”— the seeds of its flowering.
Ariosto and Sannazaro were the models and progenitors of Spenser and
Sidney, and Machiavelli and Castiglione were powerful influences in
Elizabethan and Jacobean England. It is not certain that Bacon and
Descartes could have done their work had not Pomponazzi and Machiavelli,
Telesio and Bruno paved the way with their sweat and blood.</p>
<p>Yes, Renaissance architecture is depressingly horizontal, always
except- ing the lordly cupolas that rise over Florence and Rome. The
Gothic</p>
<p>style, ecstatically vertical, reflected a religion that pictured our
terrestrial life as an exile for the soul, and placed its hopes and gods
in the sky; classic architecture expressed a religion that lodged its
deities in trees and streams and in the earth, and rarely higher than a
mountain in Thessaly; it did not look upward to find divinity. That
classic style, so cool and calm, could not fitly represent the turbulent
Renaissance, but neither could it be al- lowed to die; rightly a
generous emulation preserved its monuments, and transmitted its ideals
and principals to be a part — a sharer but not a dictator — of our
building art today. Italy could not equal Greek or Gothic archi-
tecture, nor Greek sculpture, nor, perhaps, the noblest flights of
Gothic sculpture at Chartres and Reims; hut it could produce an artist
whose Medici tombs were worthy of Pheidias, and his Fietcl of
Praxiteles.</p>
<p>For Renaissance painting there shall be no word of apology; it is
still the high point of that art in history. Spain approached that
zenith in the halcyon days of Velasquez, Murillo, Ribera, Zurbaran, and
El Greco;</p>
<p>Flanders and Holland came not quite so close in Rubens and Rembrandt.
Chinese and Japanese, painters scale heights of their own, and at times
their pictures impress us as especially profound, if only because they
see man in a large perspective; yet their cold, contemplative philosophy
or decora- tive elegance is outweighed by the richer range of complexity
and power, and the warm vitality of color, in the pictorial art of the
Florentines, of Raphael and Correggio and the Venetians. Indeed,
Renaissance painting was a sensual art, though it produced some of the
greatest religious paint- ings, and — as on the Sistine ceiling — some
of the most spiritual and sublime. But that sensuality was a wholesome
reaction. The body had been vilified long enough; woman had borne
through ungracious centuries the abuse of a harsh asceticism; it was
good that life should reaffirm, and art enhance, the loveliness of
healthy human forms. The Renaissance had tired of original sin,
breast-beating, and mythical post-mortem terrors; it turned its back
upon death and its face to life; and long before Schiller and</p>
<p>Beethoven it sang an exhilarating, incomparable ode to joy.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>The Renaissance, by recalling classic culture, ended the
thousand-year rule of the Oriental mind in Europe. From Italy by a
hundred routes the good news of the great liberation passed over
mountains and seas to France, Germany, Flanders, Holland, and England.
Scholars like Aleandro and Scaliger, artists like Leonardo, del Sarto,
Primaticcio, Cellini, and Bordone took the Renaissance to France;
Italian painters, sculptors, architects took it to Pesth, Cracow,
Warsaw; Michelozzo carried it to Cyprus; Gentile Bellini ventured with
it to Istanbul. From Italy Colet and Linacre brought it back with them
to England, Agricola and Reuchlin to Germany. The flow of ideas, morals,
and arts continued to run northward from Italy for a century. From 1500
to 1600 all western Europe acknowledged her as the mother and nurse of
the new civilization of science and art and the “humanities”; even the
id ea of the gentleman, and the aristocratic concep- tion of life and
government, came up from the south to mold the manners and states of the
north. So the sixteenth century, when the Renaissance declined in Italy,
was an age of exuberant germination in France, England, Germany,
Flanders, and Spain.</p>
<p>For a time the tensions of Reformation and Counter Reformation, the
debates of theology and the wars of religion, overlaid and overwhelmed
the influence of the Renaissance; men fought through a bloody century
for the freedom to believe and worship as they pleased, or as pleased
their kings; and the voice of reason seemed stilled by the clash of
militant faiths. But it was not altogether silent; even in that unhappy
desolation men like Erasmus, Bacon, and Descartes echoed it bravely,
gave it fresh and stronger utterance; Spinoza found for it a majestic
formulation; and in the eight- eenth century the spirit of the Italian
Renaissance was reborn in the French Enlightenment. From Voltaire and
Gibbon to Goethe and Heine, to Hugo and Flaubert, to Taine and Anatole
France, the strain was carried on, through revolution and
counterrevolution, through advance and reaction, somehow surviving war,
and patiently ennobling peace. Everywhere to- day in Europe and the
Americas there are urbane and lusty spirits — com- rades in the Country
of the Mind — who feed and live on this legacy of mental freedom,
esthetic sensitivity, friendly and sympathetic understand- ing;
