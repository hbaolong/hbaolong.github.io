<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>Buddha</p>
<p>I. THE HERETICS</p>
<p>Sceptics — Nihilists — Sophists — Atheists — Materialists —
Religions</p>
<p>without a god</p>
<p>T HAT there were doubters, even in the days of the Upanishads, ap-
pears from the Upanishads themselves. Sometimes the sages ridi-</p>
<p>culed the priests, as when the Chandogya Upanishad likens the
orthodox clergy of the time to a procession of dogs each holding the
tail of its prede- cessor, and saying, piously, “Om, let us eat; Om, let
us drink .” 1 The</p>
<p>Swasanved Upanishad announces that there is no god, no heaven, no
hell, no reincarnation, no world; that the Vedas and Upanishads are the
work of conceited fools; that ideas are illusions, and all words untrue;
that people deluded by flowery speech cling to gods and temples and
“holy men,” though in reality there is no difference between Vishnu and
a dog . 3 And the story is told of Virocana, who lived as a pupil for
thirty-two</p>
<p>years with the great god Prajapati Himself, received much instruction
about “t he Self which is free from evil, ageless, deathless,
sorrowless, hun- gerless, thirstless, whose desire is the Real,” and
then suddenly returned to earth and preached this highly scandalizing
doctrine: “One’s self is to be made happy here on earth. One’ s self is
to be waited upon. He who makes himself happy here on earth, who waits
upon himself, obtains both worlds, this world and the next .” 3 Perhaps
the good Brahmans who have preserved the history of their country have
deceived us a little about the unanimity of Hindu mysticism and
piety.</p>
<p>Indeed, as scholarship unearths some of the less respectable figures
in Indian philosophy before Buddha, a picture takes form in which, along
with saints meditating on Brahman , we find a variety of persons who de-
spised all priests, doubted all gods, and bore without trepidition the
name of Nastiks, No-sayers, Nihilists. Sangaya, the agnostic, would
neither admit nor deny life after death; he questioned the possibility
of knowl- 416</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>417</p>
<p>edge, and limited philosophy to the pursuit of peace. Purana Kashyapa
refused to accept moral distinctions, and taught that the soul is a
passive slave to chance. Maskarin Gosala held that fate determines
everything, regardless of the merits of men. Ajita Kasakambalin reduced
man to earth, water, fire and wind, and said: “Fools and wise alike, on
the dissolu - tion of the body, are cut off, annihilated, and after
death they are not .” 4 The author of the Ramayana draws a typical
sceptic in Jabali, who ridi- cules Rama for rejecting a kingdom in order
to keep a vow.</p>
<p>Jabali, a learned Brahman and a Sophist skilled in word.</p>
<p>Questioned Faith and Law and Duty, spake to young Ayodhya’s</p>
<p>lord:</p>
<p>“Wherefore, Rama, idle maxims cloud thy heart a nd warp thy mind,
Maxims which mislead the simple and the thoughtless human-</p>
<p>kind? . . .</p>
<p>Ah, I weep for erring mortals who, on erring duty bent,</p>
<p>Sacrifice this dear enjoyment till their barren life is spent.</p>
<p>Who to Gods and to the Fathers vainly still their offerings make.</p>
<p>Waste of food! for God nor Father doth our pious homage take!</p>
<p>And the food by one partaken, can it nourish other men?</p>
<p>Food bestowed upon a Brahman, can it serve our Fathers then?</p>
<p>Crafty priests have forged these maxims, and with selfish objects
say, “Make thy gifts and do thy penance, leave thy worldly wealth,
and</p>
<p>pray!”</p>
<p>There is no hereafter, Rama, vain the hope and creed of men;</p>
<p>Seek the pleasures of the present, spurn illusions poor and vain .
6</p>
<p>When Buddha grew to manhood he found the halls, the streets, the very
woods of northern India ringing with philosophic disputation, mostly of
an atheistic and materialistic trend. The later Upanishads and the old-
est Buddhist books are full of references to these heretics . 6 A large
class of traveling Sophists — the Paribbajaka, or Wanderers — spent the
better part of every year in passing from locality to locality, seeking
pupils, or antago- nists, in philosophy. Some of them taught logic as
the art of proving any- th ing, and earned for themselves the titles of
“Hair - splitters” and “Eel - wrigglers”; others demonstrated the non
-existence of God, and the inex- pediency of virtue. Large audiences
gathered to hear such lectures and de- bates; great halls were built to
accommodate them; and sometimes princes</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>418</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>offered rewards for those who should emerge victorious from these
intel- lectual jousts.’ It was an age of amazingly free thought, and of
a thou - sand experiments in philosophy.</p>
<p>Not much has come down to us from these sceptics, and their memory
has been preserved almost exclusively through the diatribes of their
enemies . 8 The oldest name among them is Brihaspati, but his nihilistic
Sutras have perished, and all that remains of him is a poem denouncing
the priests in language free from all metaphysical obscurity:</p>
<p>No heaven exists, no final liberation,</p>
<p>No soul, no other world, no rites of caste. . . .</p>
<p>The triple Veda, triple self-command,</p>
<p>And all the dust and ashes of repentance —</p>
<p>These yield a means of livelihood for men</p>
<p>Devoid of intellect and manliness. . . .</p>
<p>How can this body when reduced to dust</p>
<p>Revisit earth? And if a ghost can pass</p>
<p>To other worlds, why does not strong affection</p>
<p>For those he leaves behind attract him back?</p>
<p>The costly rites enjoined for those who die</p>
<p>Are but a means of livelihood devised</p>
<p>By sacerdotal cunning — nothing more. . . .</p>
<p>While life endures let life be spent in ease</p>
<p>And merriment; let a man borrow money</p>
<p>From all his friends, and feast on melted butter.*</p>
<p>Out of the aphorisms of Brihaspati came a whole school of Hindu ma-
terialists, named, after one of them, Charvakas. They laughed at the
notion that the Vedas were divinely revealed truth; truth, they argued,
can never be known, except through the senses. Even reason is not to be
trusted, for every inference depends for its validity not only upon ac-
curate observation and correct reasoning, but also upon the assumption
that the future will behave like the past; and of this, as Hume was to
say, there can be no certainty . 10 What is not perceived by the senses,
said the Charvakas , does not exist; therefore the soul is a delusion,
and Atman is humbug. We do not observe, in experience or history, any
interposition of supernatural forces in the world. All phenomena are
natural; only simpletons trace them to demons or gods.“ Matter is the
one reality; the body is a combination of atoms ; 18 the mind is merely
matter thinking; the</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>419</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>body, not the soul, feels, sees, hears, thinks. 1 * “Who has seen the
soul exist - ing in a state separate from the body?” There is no
immortality, no re - birth. Religion is an aberration, a disease, or a
chicanery; the hypothesis of a god is useless for explaining or
understanding the world. Men think religion necessary only because,
being accustomed to it, they feel a sense of loss, and an uncomfortable
void, when the growth of knowledge</p>
<p>destroys this faith . 14 Morality, too, is natural; it is a social
convention and convenience, not a divine command. Nature is indifferent
to good and bad, virtue and vice, and lets the sun shine
indiscriminately upon knaves and saints; if nature has any ethical
quality at all it is that of transcendent immorality. There is no need
to control instinct and passion, for these are the instructions of
nature to men. Virtue is a mistake; the purpose of life is living, and
the o:Jy wisdom is happiness . 15</p>
<p>This revolutionary philosophy of the Charvakas put an end to the age
of the Vedas and the Lpanishads. It weakened the hold of the Brah-</p>
<p>mans on the mind of India, and left in Hindu society a vacuum which
almost compelled the growth of a new religion. But the materialists had
done their work so thoroughly that both of the new religions which</p>
<p>arose to replace the old Vedic faith were, anomalous though it may
sound, atheistic religions, devotions without a god. Both belonged to
the Nastika or Nihilistic movement; and both were originated not by the
Brahman priests but by members of the Kshatriya warrior caste, in a
reaction</p>
<p>against sacerdotal ceremonialism and theology. With the coming of
Jainism and Buddhism a new epoch began in the history of India.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MAHAVIRA AND THE JAINS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Great Hero — The Jain creed — Atheistic polytheism — Asceti-</p>
<p>cism — Salvation by suicide — Later history of the Jains</p>
<p>About the middle of the sixth century b.c. a boy was born to a
wealthy nobleman of the Lichchavi tribe in a suburb of the city of
Vaishali, in what is now the province of Bihar.* His parents, though
wealthy, belonged to a sect that looked upon rebirth as a curse, and
upon suicide as a blessed privilege. When their son had reached his
thirty-first year they ended their lives by voluntary starvation. The
young man, moved to the depths</p>
<p>•Tradition gives Mahavira’s dates as 599 -527 b.c.; but Jacobi
believes that 549-477 B.C. would be nearer the fact. 16</p>
<p>4 2 ° THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>of his soul, renounced the world and its ways, divested himself of
all clothing, and wandered through western Bengal as an ascetic, seeking
self- purification and understanding. After thirteen years of such
self-denial, he was hailed by a group of disciples as a Jina
(“conqueror”), i.e., one of the great teachers whom fate, they believed,
had ordained to appear at regular intervals to enlighten the people of
India. They rechristened their leader Mahavira, or the Great Hero, and
took to themselves, from their most characteristic belief, the name of
Jains. Mahavira organized a celibate clergy and an order of nuns, and
when he died, aged seventy-two, left be- hind him fourteen thousand
devotees.</p>
<p>Gradually this sect developed one of the strangest bodies of doctrine
in all the history of religion. They began with a realistic logic, in
which knowledge was described as confined to the relative and temporal.
Noth- ing is true, they taught, except from one point of view; from
other points of view it would probably be false. They were fond of
quoting the story of the six blind men who laid hands on different parts
of an elephant; he who held the ear thought that the elephant was a
great winnowing fan; he who held the leg said the animal was a big,
round pillar.” All judgments, therefore, are limited and conditional;
absolute truth comes only to the periodic Redeemers or Jinas. Nor can
the Vedas help; they are not in- spired by God, if only for the reason
that there is no God. It is not neces- sary, said the Jains, to assume a
Creator or First Cause; any child can refute that assumption by showing
that an uncreated Creator, or a causeless Cause, is just as hard to
understand as an uncaused or uncreated world. It is more logical to
believe that the universe has existed from all eternity, and that its
infinite changes and revolutions are due to the inherent powers of
nature rather than to the intervention of a deity.”</p>
<p>But the climate of India does not lend itself to a persistently
naturalistic creed. The Jains, having emptied the sky of God, soon
peopled it again with the deified saints of Jain history and legend.
These they worshiped with devotion and ceremony, but even them they
considered subject to transmigration and decay, and not in any sense as
the creators or rulers of the world.” Nor were the Jains materialists;
they accepted a dualistic distinction of mind and matter everywhere; in
all things, even in stones and metals, there were souls. Any soul that
achieved a blameless life be- came a Paramatman, or supreme soul, and
was spared reincarnation for a while; when its reward had equaled its
merit, however, it was born into the flesh again. Only the highest and
most perfect spirits could achieve</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>421</p>
<p>complete “release”; these were the Arhats, or supreme lords , who
lived like Epicurus’ deities in some distant and shadowy realm, impotent
to affect the affairs of men, but happily removed from all chances of
rebirth.”</p>
<p>The road to release, said the Jains, was by ascetic penances and com-
plete ahimsa — abstinence from injury to any living thing. Every Jain
as- cetic must take five vows: not to kill anything, not to lie, not to
take what is not given, to preserve chastity, and to renounce pleasure
in all external things. Sense pleasure, they thought, is always a sin;
the ideal is indiffer- ence to pleasure and pain, and independence of
all external objects. Agri- culture is forbidden to the Jain, because it
tears up the soil and crushes insects or worms. The good Jain rejects
honey as the life of the bee, strains water lest he destroy creatures
lurking in it when he drinks, veils his mouth for fear of inhaling and
killing the organisms of the air, screens his lamp to protect insects
from the flame, and sweeps the ground before him as he walks lest his
naked foot should trample out some life. The Jain must never slaughter
or sacrifice an animal; and if he is thorough- going he establishes
hospitals or asylums, as at Ahmedabad, for old or injured beasts. The
only life that he may kill is his own. His doctrine</p>
<p>highly approves of suicide, especially by slow starvation, for this
is the greatest victory of the spirit over the blind will to live. Many
Jains have died in this way; and the leaders of the sect are said to
leave the world, even today, by self- starvation.”</p>
<p>A religion based upon so profound a doubt and denial of life
might</p>
<p>have found some popular support in a country where life has always
been hard; but even in India its extreme asceticism limited its appeal.
From the beginning the Jains were a select minority; and though Yuan
Chwang found them numerous and powerful in the seventh century,” it was
a passing zenith in a quiet career. About 79 a.d. a great schism divided
them on the question of nudity; from that time on the Jains have
belonged either to the Shwetambara — white-robed — sect, or to the
Digambaras — sky clad or nude. Today both sects wear the usual cloth-
ing of their place and time; only their saints go about the streets
naked. These sects have further sects to divide them: the Digambaras
have four, the Shwetambaras eighty- four;” together they number only
1,300, - 000 adherents out of a population of 320,000,000 souls.” Gandhi
has been strongly influenced by the Jain sect, has accepted ahimsa as
the basis of his policy and his life, contents himself with a
loin-cloth, and may starve himself to death. The Jains may yet name him
as one of their Jinas,</p>

<li>THE LEGEND OF BUDDHA</li>
</ol>
<p>The background of Buddhism — The miraculous birth — Youth —</p>
<p>The sorrows of life — Flight — Ascetic years — Enlighten-</p>
<p>ment — A vision of “ Nirvana ”</p>
<p>It is difficult to see, across 2,500 years, what were the economic,
po- litical and moral conditions that called forth religions so ascetic
and</p>
<p>pessimistic as Jainism and Buddhism. Doubtless much material progress
had been made since the establishment of the Aryan rule in India: great
cities like Pataliputra and Vaishali had been built; industry and trade
had created wealth, wealth had generated leisure, leisure had devel-
oped knowledge and culture. Probably it was the riches of India that
produced the epicureanism and materialism of the seventh and sixth
centuries before Christ. Religion does not prosper under prosperity; the
senses liberate themselves from pious restraints, and formulate philoso-
phies that will justify their liberation. As in the China of Confucius
and the Greece of Protagoras — not to speak of our own day — so in
Buddha’s India the intellectual decay of the old religion had begotten
ethical scep- ticism and moral anarchy. Jainism and Buddhism, though
impregnated with the melancholy atheism of a disillusioned age, were
religious reac- tions against the hedonistic creeds of an “emancipated”
and worldly lei - sure class.*</p>
<p>Hindu tradition describes Buddha’s father, Shuddhodhana, as a man of
the world, member of the Gautama clan of the proud Shakya tribe, and
prince or king of Kapilavastu, at the foot of the Himalayan range. 25 In
truth, however, we know nothing certain about Buddha; and if we give
here the stories that have gathered about his name it is not because
these are history, but because they are an essential part of Hindu
literature and Asiatic religion. Scholarship assigns his birth to
approximately 563 B.c., and can say no more; legend takes up the tale,
and reveals to us in</p>

<li>It has often been remarked that this period was distinguished by a
shower of stars in the history of genius: Mahavira and Buddha in India,
Lao-tze and Confucius in China, Jeremiah and the Second Isaiah in Judea,
the pre-Socratic philosophers in Greece, and perhaps Zarathustra in
Persia. Such a simultaneity of genius suggests more intercom- munication
and mutual influence among these ancient cultures than it is possible to
trace definitely today.</li>

<p>what strange ways men may be conceived. At that time, says one of the
Jataka books,*</p>
<p>in the city of Kapilavastu the festival of the full moon . . .
had</p>
<p>been proclaimed. Queen Maya from the seventh day before the full moon
celebrated the festival without intoxicants, and with abundance of
garlands and perfumes. Rising early on the seventh day she bathed in
scented water, and bestowed a great gift of four hundred thou-</p>
<p>sand pieces as alms. Fully adorned, she ate of choice food, took upon
herself the Uposatha vows,+ entered her adorned state bed-chamber, lay
down on the bed, and falling asleep, dreamt this dream.</p>
<p>Four great kings, it seemed, raised her together with the bed,
and</p>
<p>taking her to the Himalayas, set her on the Manosila table-land. . .
.</p>
<p>Then their queens came and took her to the Anotatta Lake, bathed</p>
<p>her to remove human stain, robed her in heavenly clothing, anointed
her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Not far</p>
<p>away is a silver mountain, and thereon a golden mansion. There</p>
<p>they prepared a divine bed with head to the east, and laid her upon
it. Now the Bodhisattwa$ became a white elephant. Not far from</p>
<p>there is a golden mountain; and going there he descended from it,</p>
<p>alighted on the silver mountain, approaching it from the
direction</p>
<p>of the north. In his trunk, which was like a silver rope, he held
a</p>
<p>white lotus. Then, trumpeting, he entered the golden mansion, made a
rightwise circle three times around his mother’s bed, smote her</p>
<p>right side, and appeared to enter her womb. Thus he received . .
.</p>
<p>a new existence.</p>
<p>The next day the Queen awoke and told her dream to the King.</p>
<p>The King summoned sixty-four eminent Brahmans, showed them</p>
<p>honor, and satisfied them with excellent food and other presents.</p>
<p>Then, when they were satisfied with these pleasures, he caused the
dream to be told, and asked what would happen. The Brahmans</p>
<p>said: Be not anxious, O King; the Queen has conceived, a male not</p>
<p>a female, and thou shalt have a son; and if he dwells in a house

Buddha, meaning “Enlightened,” is among the many titles given to the
Master, whose personal name was Siddhartha, and whose clan name was
Gautama. He was also called Shaky a-?mmi, or “Sage of the Shakyas,” and
Tathagata y “One Who Has Won the Truth.” Buddha never applied any of
these titles to himself, so far as we know. 5 “</p>

<p>goes forth from the world, he will become a Buddha, a remover,</p>
<p>in the world, of the veil (of ignorance). . . .</p>
<p>Queen Maya, bearing the Bodhisattwa for ten months like oil in a</p>
<p>bowl, when her time was come, desired to go to her relatives’ house,
and addressed King Shuddhodhana: “I wish, O King, to g o to Deva-</p>
<p>daha, the city of my family.” The King approved, and caused the</p>
<p>road from Kapilavastu to Devadaha to be made smooth and adorned with
vessels filled with plantains, flags and banners; and seating her in a
golden palanquin borne by a thousand courtiers, sent her with a great
retinue. Between the two cities, and belonging to the inhabi-</p>
<p>tants of both, is a pleasure grove of Sal trees named the Lumbini</p>
<p>Grove. At that time, from the roots to the tips of the branches,</p>
<p>it was one mass of flowers. . . . When the Queen saw it, a desire</p>
<p>to sport in the grove arose. . . . She went to the foot of a
great</p>
<p>Sal tree, and desired to seize a branch. The branch, like the tip
of</p>
<p>a supple reed, bent down and came within reach of her hand.</p>
<p>Stretching out her hand she received the branch. Thereupon she</p>
<p>was shaken with the throes of birth. So the multitude set up a
cur-</p>
<p>tain for her, and retired. Holding the branch, and even while
stand-</p>
<p>ing, she was delivered. . . . And as other beings when bom come</p>
<p>forth stained with impure matter, not so the Bodhisattwa. But the</p>
<p>Bodhisattwa, like a preacher of the Doctrine descending from the</p>
<p>seat of Doctrine, like a man descending stairs, stretched out his two
hands and feet, and standing unsoiled and unstained by any impurity,
shining like a jewel laid on Benares cloth, descended from his</p>
<p>mother.“</p>
<p>It must further be understood that at Buddha’s birth a great light ap
- peared in the sky, the deaf heard, the dumb spoke, the lame were made
straight, gods bent down from heaven to assist him, and kings came from
afar to welcome him. Legend paints a colorful picture of the splen- dor
and luxury that surrounded him in his youth. He dwelt as a happy prince
in three palaces “like a god,” protected by his loving father from all
contact with the pain and grief of human life. Forty thousand danc- ing
girls entertained him, and when he came of age five hundred ladies were
sent to him that he might choose one as his wife. As a member of the
Kshatriya caste, he received careful training in the military arts; but
also he sat at the feet of sages, and made himself master of all the</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>philosophical theories current in his time.® He married, became a
happy father, and lived in wealth, peace and good repute.</p>
<p>One day, says pious tradition, he went forth from his palace into the
streets among the people, and saw an old man; and on another day he went
forth and saw a sick man; and on a third day he went forth and saw a
dead man. He himself, in the holy books of his disciples, tells the tale
movingly:</p>
<p>Then, O monks, did I, endowed with such majesty and such ex-</p>
<p>cessive delicacy, think thus: “An ignorant, ordinary person, who
is</p>
<p>himself subject to old age, not beyond the sphere of old age, on</p>
<p>seeing an old man, is troubled, ashamed and disgusted, extending the
thought to himself. I, too, am subject to old age, not beyond the</p>
<p>sphere of old age; and should I, who am subject to old age, . . .</p>
<p>on seeing an old man, be troubled, ashamed and disgusted?” This</p>
<p>seemed to me not fitting. As I thus reflected, all the elation in
youth suddenly disappeared. . . . Thus, O monks, before my
enlightenment, being myself subject to birth, I sought out the nature of
birth; being subject to old age I sought out the nature of old age, of
sickness, of</p>
<p>sorrow, of impurity. Then I thought: “What if I, being myself</p>
<p>subject to birth, were to seek out the nature of birth, . . . and
having seen the wretchedness of the nature of birth, were to seek out
the</p>
<p>unb orn, the supreme peace of Nirvana?”“</p>
<p>Death is the origin of all religions, and perhaps if there had been
no</p>
<p>death there would have been no gods. To Buddha these sights were the
beginning of “enlightenment.” Like one overcome with “conversion,” he
suddenly resolved to leave his father,* his wife and his newborn son,
and become an ascetic in the desert. During the night he stole into his
wife’s room, and looked for the last time upon his son, Rahula. Just
then, say the Buddhist Scriptures, in a passage sacred to all followers
of</p>
<p>Gautama,</p>
<p>a lamp of scented oil was burning. On the bed strewn with heaps of
jessamine and other flowers, the mother of Rahula was sleeping, with her
hand on her son’s head. The Bodhisattwa, standing with his foot on the
threshold, looked, and thought, “If I move aside the Queen’s</p>
<ul>
<li>His mother had died in giving him birth.</li>
</ul>
<p>4 2&lt;5 the story of civilization (chap. XV</p>
<p>hand and take my son, the Queen will awake, and this will be an</p>
<p>obstacle to my going. When I have become a Buddha I will come</p>
<p>back and see him.” And he descended from the palace.”</p>
<p>In the dark of the morning he rode out of the city on his horse
Kan-</p>
<p>thaka, with his charioteer Chauna clinging desperately to the tail.
Then Mara, Prince of Evil, appeared to him and tempted him, offering him
great empires. But Buddha refused, and riding on, crossed a broad river
with one mighty leap. A desire to look again at his native city arose in
him, but he did not turn. Then the great earth turned round, so that
he</p>
<p>might not have to look back . 83</p>
<p>He stopped at a place called Uruvela. “There,” he says, “I thought to
myself, truly this is a pleasant spot, and a beautiful forest. Clear
flows the river, and pleasant are the bathing-places; all around are
meadows and villages.” Here he devoted himself to the severest forms of
asceticism; for six years he tried the ways of the Yogis who had already
appeared on the Indian scene. He lived on seeds and grass, and for one
period he fed on dung. Gradually he reduced his food to a grain of rice
each day. He wore hair cloth, plucked out his hair and beard for
torture’s sake, stood for long hours, or lay upon thorns. He let the
dust and dirt accumulate upon his body until he looked like an old tree.
He frequented a place where human corpses were exposed to be eaten by
birds and beasts, and slept among the rotting carcasses. And again, he
tells us,</p>
<p>I thought, what if now I set my teeth, press my tongue to my palate,
and restrain, crush and bum out my mind with my mind. (I did</p>
<p>so.) And sweat flowed from my arm-pits. . . . Then I thought,
what</p>
<p>if I now practice trance without breathing. So I restrained breathing
in and out from mouth and nose. And as I did so there was a</p>
<p>violent sound of winds issuing from my ears. . . . Just as if a
strong</p>
<p>man were to crash one’s head with the point of a sword, even so did
violent winds disturb my head. . . . Then I thought, what if I were</p>
<p>to take food only in small amounts, as much as my hollowed palm</p>
<p>would hold, juices of beans, vetches, chick-peas, or pulse. . . .
My</p>
<p>body became extremely lean. The mark of my seat was like a camel’s
foot-print through the little food. The bones of my spine, when</p>
<p>bent and straightened, were like a row of spindles through the little
food. And as, in a deep well, the deep, low-lying sparkling of the</p>
<p>waters is seen, so in my eye-sockets was seen the deep, low-lying</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>sparkling of my eyes through the little food. And as a bitter
gourd,</p>
<p>cut off raw, is cracked and withered through rain and sun, so was</p>
<p>the skin of my head withered through the little food. When I</p>
<p>thought I would touch the skin of my stomach I actually took hold</p>
<p>of my spine. . . . When I thought I would ease myself I there-</p>
<p>upon fell prone through the little food. To relieve my body I</p>
<p>stroked my limbs with my hand, and as I did so the decayed hairs</p>
<p>fell from my body through the little food . 58</p>
<p>But one day the thought came to Buddha that self -mortification was
not the way. Perhaps he was unusually hungry on that day, or some mem-
ory of loveliness stirred within him. He perceived that no new enlight-
enment had come to him from these austerities. “By this severity I do
not attain superhuman — truly noble — knowledge and insight.” On the
contrary, a certain pride in his self-torture had poisoned any holiness
that might have grown from it. He abandoned his asceticism, went to sit
under a shade-giving tree,* and remained there steadfast and motionless,
resolving never to leave that seat until enlightenment came to him.
What, he asked himself, was the source of human sorrow, suffering,
sickness, old age and death? Suddenly a vision came to him of the
infinite succes- sion of deaths and births in the stream of life: he saw
every death frus- trated with new birth, every peace and joy balanced
with new desire and discontent, new disappointment, new grief and pain.
“Thus, with mind concentrated, purified, cleansed, … I directed my mind
to the pass- ing away and rebirth of beings. With divine, purified,
superhuman vision I saw beings passing away and being reborn, low and
high, of good and bad color, in happy or miserable existences, according
to their karma”— according to that universal law by which every act of
good or of evil will be rewarded or punished in this life, or in some
later incarnation of the soul.</p>
<p>It was the vision of this apparently ridiculous succession of
deaths</p>
<p>and births that made Buddha scorn human life. Birth, he told himself,
is the origin of all evil. And yet birth continues endlessly, forever
re-</p>
<p>plenishing the stream of human sorrow. If birth could be stopped. . .
. Why is birth not stopped? f Because the law of karma demands new rein-
carnations in which the soul may atone for evil done in past
existences.</p>

<p>If, however, a man could live a life of perfect justice, of
unvarying</p>
<p>patience and kindness to all, if he could tie his thoughts to eternal
things, not binding his heart to those that begin and pass away — then,
perhaps, he would be spared rebirth, and for him the fountain of evil
would run dry. If one could sti ll all desires for one’s self, and seek
only to do good, then individuality, that first and worst delusion of
mankind, might be over- come, and the soul would merge at last with
unconscious infinity. What peace there would be in the heart that had
cleansed itself of every per- sonal desire! — and what heart that had
not so cleansed itself could ever know peace? Happiness is possible
neither here, as paganism thinks, nor hereafter, as many religions
think. Only peace is possible, only the cool quietude of craving ended,
only Nirvana.</p>
<p>And so, after seven years of meditation, the Enlightened One, having
learned the cause of human suffering, went forth to the Holy City of
Benares, and there, in the deer-park at Samath, preached Nirvana to
men.</p>

<p>Like the other teachers of his time, Buddha taught through conversa-
tion, lectures, and parables. Since it never occurred to him, any more
than to Socrates or Christ, to put his doctrine into writing, he summar-
ized it in sutras (“threads”) de signed to prompt the memory. As pre-
served for us in the remembrance of his followers these discourses un-
consciously portray for us the first distinct character in India’s
history: a</p>
<ul>
<li>The oldest extant documents purporting to be the teaching of Buddha
are the Pitakas, or “Baskets of the Law,” prepared for the Buddhist
Council of 241 b.c., accepted by it as genuine, transmitted orally for
four centuries from the death of Buddha, and finally put into writing,
in the Pali tongue, about 80 b.c. These Pitakas are divided into three
groups: the Sutta, or tales; the Vinaya , or discipline; and the
Abhidhamma, or doctrine. The Sutta-pitaka contains the dialogues of
Buddha, which Rhys Davids ranks with those of Plato. 84 Strictly
speaking, however, these writings give us the teaching not necessarily
of Buddha himself, but only of the Buddhist schools. “Though these
narratives,” says Sir Charles Elliot, “are compilations which accepted
new matter during several centuries, I see no reason to doubt that the
oldest stratum contains the recollections of those who had seen and
heard the master.” 88</li>
</ul>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>man of strong will, authoritative and proud, but of gentle manner and
speech, and of infinite benevolence. He claimed “enlightenment,” but not
inspiration; he never pretended that a god was speaking through him. In
controversy he was more patient and considerate than any other of the
great teachers of mankind. His disciples, perhaps idealizing him, rep-
resented him as fully practising ahimsa : “putting away the killing
of</p>
<p>living things, Gautama the recluse holds aloof from the destruction
of life. He” (once a Kshatriya warrior) “has laid the cudgel and the
sword aside, and ashamed of roughness, and full of mercy, he dwells
compassion- ate and kind to all creatures that have life. . . . Putting
away slander, Gautama holds himself aloof from calumny. . . . Thus does
he live as a binder-together of those who are divided, an encourager of
those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for
peace, a speaker of words that make for peace .” 86 Like Lao -tze and
Christ he wished to return good for evil, love for hate; and he remained
silent under misunderstanding and abuse. “If a man foolishly does me
wrong, I will return to him the protection of my ungrudging love; the
more evil comes from him, the more good shall come from me.” When a
simple - ton abused him, Buddha listened in silence; but when the man
had fin- ished, Buddha asked him: “Son, if a man de clined to accept a
present made to him, to whom would it belong?” The man answered: “To</p>
<p>him who offered it.” “My son,” said Buddha, “I decline to accept your
abuse, and request you to keep it for yourself .” 37 Unlike most saints,
Buddha had a sense of humor, and knew that metaphysics without</p>
<p>laughter is immodesty.</p>
<p>His method of teaching was unique, though it owed something to the
Wanderers, or traveling Sophists, of his time. He walked from town to
town, accompanied by his favorite disciples, and followed by as many as
twelve hundred devotees. He took no thought for the morrow, but was
content to be fed by some local admirer; once he scandalized his follow-
ers by eating in the home of a courtesan . 88 He stopped at the
outskirts of a village, and pitched camp in some garden or wood, or on
some river- bank. The afternoon he gave to meditation, the evening to
instruction. His discourses took the form of Socratic questioning, moral
parables, courteous controversy, or succinct formulas whereby he sought
to com- press his teaching into convenient brevity and order. His
favorite sutra was the “Four Noble Truths,” in which he expounded his
view that life is pain, that pain is due to desire, and that wisdom lies
in stilling all desire.</p>

<li>Now this, O monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of pain:</li>

<li>Now this, O monks, is the noble truth of the way that leads to</li>
</ol>
<p>the cessation of pain: this is the noble Eightfold Way: namely,
right</p>
<p>views, right intention, right speech, right action, right living,
right</p>
<p>effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.®</p>
<p>Buddha was convinced that pain so overbalanced pleasure in human life
that it would be better never to have been born. More tears have flowed,
he tells us, than all the water that is in the four great oceans.“ Every
pleasure seemed poisoned for him by its brevity. “Is that which is
impermanent, sorrow or joy?” he asks one of his disciples; and the
answer is, “Sorrow, Lord.” 41 The basic evil, then, is tanha— not all
desire, but selfish desire, desire directed to the advantage of the part
rather than to the good of the whole; above all, sexual desire, for that
leads to reproduc- tion, which stretches out the chain of life into new
suffering aimlessly. One of his disciples concluded that Buddha would
approve of suicide, but Buddha reproved him; suicide would be useless,
since the soul, unpurified, would be reborn in other incarnations until
it achieved complete forget- fulness of self.</p>
<p>When his disciples asked him to define more clearly his conception of
right living, he formulated for their guidance “Five Moral Rules”— com-
mandments simple and brief, but “perhaps more comprehensive, and harder
to keep, t han the Decalogue”: 43</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let not one kill any living being.</p></li>
<li><p>Let not one take what is not given to him.</p></li>
<li><p>Let not one speak falsely.</p></li>
<li><p>Let not one drink intoxicating drinks.</p></li>
<li><p>Let not one be unchaste.“</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>Elsewhere Buddha introduced elements into his teaching strangely</p>
<p>anticipatory of Christ. “Let a man overcome anger by kindness, evil
by good. . . . Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. . .
. Never in the world does hatred cease by hatred; hatred ceases by-
love.” 4 * Like Jesus he was uncomfortable in the presence of women, and
hesitated long before admitting them into the Buddhist order. His
favorite disciple, Ananda, once asked him:</p>
<p>“How are we to conduct ourselves, Lord, with regards t o woman-</p>
<p>kind?”</p>
<p>“As not seeing them, Ananda.”</p>
<p>“But if we should see them, what are we to do?”</p>
<p>“No talking, Ananda.”</p>
<p>“But if they should speak to us, Lord, what are we to do?”</p>
<p>“Keep wide awake, Ananda.”* 5</p>
<p>His conception of religion was purely ethical; he cared everything
about conduct, nothing about ritual or worship, metaphysics or theology.
When a Brahman proposed to purify himself of his sins by bathing at
Gaya, Buddha said to him: “Have thy bath here, even here, O Brahman. Be
kind to all beings. If thou speakest not false, if thou killest not
life, if thou takest not what is not given to thee, secure in
self-denial — what wouldst thou gain by going to Gaya? Any water is Gaya
to thee.” 45</p>
<p>There is nothing stranger in the history of religion than the sight
of</p>
<p>Buddha founding a worldwide religion, and yet refusing to be drawn
into any discussion about eternity, immortality, or God. The infinite is
a myth, he says, a fiction of philosophers who have not the modesty to
confess that an atom can never understand the cosmos. He smiles 47 at
the debate over the finity or infinity of the universe, quite as if he
foresaw the futile astromythology of physicists and mathematicians who
debate the same question today. He refuses to express any opinion as to
whether the world had a beginning or will have an end; whether the soul
is the same as the body, or distinct from it; whether, even for the
greatest saint, there is to be any reward in any heaven. He calls such
questions “the jungle, the desert, the puppet-show, the writhing, the
entanglement, of speculation,” 45 and will have nothing to do with them;
they lead only to feverish disputation, personal resentments, and
sorrow; they never lead to wisdom and peace. Saintliness and content lie
not in knowledge of the</p>
<p>43 2 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>universe and God, but simply in selfless and beneficent living . 49
And then, with scandalous humor, he suggests that the gods themselves,
if they ex- isted, could not answer these questions.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Kevaddha, there occurred to a certain brother</p>
<p>in this very company of the brethren a doubt on the following point:
“Where now do these four great elements— earth, water, fire and</p>
<p>wind — pass away, leaving no trace behind?” S o that brother worked
himself up into such a state of ecstasy that the way leading to the</p>
<p>world of the Gods became clear to his ecstatic vision.</p>
<p>Then that brother, Kevaddha, went up to the realm of the Four</p>
<p>Great Kings, and said to the gods thereof: “ Where, my friends,
do</p>
<p>the four great elements — earth, water, fire and wind — cease,
leaving no trace behind?”</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken the gods in the Heaven of the</p>
<p>Four Great Kings said to him: “We, brother, do not know that.</p>
<p>But there are the Four Great Kings, more potent and more glorious</p>
<p>than we. They will know it.”</p>
<p>Then that brother, Kevaddha, went to the Four Great Kings (and</p>
<p>put the same question, and was sent on, by a similar reply, to
the</p>
<p>Thirty-three, who sent him on to their king, Sakka; who sent him on
to the Yama gods, who sent him on to their king, Suyama; who sent him on
to the Tusita gods, who sent him on to their king, Santusita;</p>
<p>who sent him on to the Nimmana-rati gods, who sent him on to</p>
<p>their king, Sunimmita; who sent him on to the Para-nimmita Vasa-</p>
<p>vatti gods, who sent him on to their king, Vasavatti, who sent
him</p>
<p>on to the gods of the Brahma-world).</p>
<p>Then that brother, Kevaddha, became so absorbed by self-concen-</p>
<p>tration that the way to the Brahma-world became clear to his mind</p>
<p>thus pacified. And he drew near to the gods of the retinue of</p>
<p>Brahma, and said: “Where, my friends, do the four great elements—
earth, water, fire and wind — cease, leaving no trace behind?”</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, the gods of the retinue of Brahma</p>
<p>replied: “We, brother, do not know that. But there is Brahma, the</p>
<p>great Brahma, the Supreme One, the Mighty One, the All-seeing</p>
<p>One, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Controller, the Creator, the</p>
<p>Chief of all, . . . the Ancient of days, the Father of all that are
and</p>
<p>are to be! He is more potent and more glorious than we. He will</p>
<p>know it.”</p>
<p>“Where, then, is that great Brahma now?”</p>
<p>“We, brother, know not where Brahma is, nor why Brahma is.</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>nor whence. But, brother, when the signs of his coming appear,</p>
<p>when the light ariseth, and the glory shineth, then will he be
mani-</p>
<p>fest. For that is the portent of the manifestation of Brahma when</p>
<p>the light ariseth, and the glory shineth.”</p>
<p>And it was not long, Kevaddha, before that great Brahma became</p>
<p>manifest. And that brother drew near to him, and said: “Where, my
friend, do the four great elements — earth, water, fire and wind —
cease, leaving no trace behind?”</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken that great Brahma s aid to him: “I,</p>
<p>brother, am the great Brahma, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-</p>
<p>seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Controller, the Creator,
the</p>
<p>Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days,
the</p>
<p>Father of all that are and are to be!”</p>
<p>Then that brother answered Brahma, and said: “I did not ask you,</p>
<p>friend, as to whether you were indeed all that you now say. But I</p>
<p>ask you where the four great elements — earth, water, fire and wind-
cease, leaving no trace behind?”</p>
<p>Then again, Kevaddha, Brahma gave the same reply. And that</p>
<p>brother yet a third time put to Brahma his question as before.</p>
<p>Then, Kevaddha, the great Brahma took that brother and led him</p>
<p>aside, and said: “These gods, the retinue of Brahma, hold me,</p>
<p>brother, to be such that there is nothing I cannot see, nothing I
have not understood, nothing I have not realized. Therefore I gave
no</p>
<p>answer in their presence. I do not know, brother, where those
four</p>
<p>great elements — earth, water, fire and wind — cease, leaving no
trace behind .” 60</p>
<p>When some students remind him that the Brahmans claim to know the
solutions of these problems, he laughs them off: “There are, brethren,
some recluses and Brahmans who wriggle like eels; and when a question is
put to them on this or that they resort to equivocation, to eel-
wriggling .”* 1 If ever he is sharp it is against the priests of his
time; he scorns their as - sumption that the Vedas were inspired by the
gods , 62 and he scandalizes the caste-proud Brahmans by accepting into
his order the members of any caste. He does not explicitly condemn the
caste-system, but he tells his disciples, plainly enough: “Go into all
lands and preach this gospel. Tell them that the poor and the lowly, the
rich and the high, are all one, and th at all castes unite in this
religion as do the rivers in the sea .” 58 He de - nounces the notion of
sacrificing to the gods, and looks with horror upon the slaughter of
animals for these rites ; 54 he rejects all cult and worship of</p>
<p>434 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XV</p>
<p>supernatural beings, all mantras and incantations, all asceticism and
all prayer . 65 Quietly, and without controversy, he offers a religion
absolutely free of dogma and priestcraft, and proclaims a way of
salvation open to infidels and believers alike.</p>
<p>At times this most famous of Hindu saints passes from agnosticism to
outright atheism. 66 * He does not go out of his way to deny deity, and
occasionally he speaks as if Brahma were a reality rather than an ideal
; 66 nor does he forbid the popular worship of the gods . 66 But he
smiles at the notion of sending up prayers to the Unknowable; “it is
foolish,” he says, “to suppose that another can cause us happiness or
misery” 60 — these are always the product of our own behavior and our
own desires. He refuses to rest his moral code upon supernatural
sanctions of any kind; he offers no heaven, no purgatory, and no hell .
61 He is too sensitive to the suffering and killing involved in the
biological process to suppose that they have been consciously willed by
a personal divinity; these cosmic blunders, he thinks, outweigh the
evidences of design.“ In this scene of order and confusion, of good and
evil, he finds no principle of perma- nence, no center of everlasting
reality,“ but only a whirl and flux of</p>
<p>obstinate life, in which the one metaphysical ultimate is change.</p>
<p>As he proposes a theology without a deity, so he offers a psychology
without a soul; he repudiates animism in every form, even in the case of
man. He agrees with Heraclitus and Bergson about the world, and with
Hume about the mind. All that we know is our sensations; therefore, so
far as we can see, all matter is force, all substance is motion. Life
is</p>
<p>change, a neutral stream of becoming and extincti on; the “soul” is a
myth which, for the convenience of our weak brains, we unwarrantably
posit behind the flow of conscious states . 64 This “transcendental
unity of apper - ception,” this “mind” that weaves sensations and
perceptions into thought, is a ghost; all that exists is the sensations
and perceptions themselves, fall- ing automatically into memories and
ideas.“ Even the precious “ego” is not an entity distinct from these
mental states; it is merely the continu- ity of these states, the
remembrance of earlier by later states, together with the mental and
moral habits, the dispositions and tendencies, of the organism . 66 The
succession of these states is caused not by a mythical “will” superadded
to them, but by the determinism of heredity, habit,</p>

<p>environment and circumstance. 61 This fluid mind that is only mental
states, this soul or ego that is only a character or prejudice formed by
helpless inheritance and transient experience, can have no immortality
in any sense that implies the continuance of the individual. 68 Even the
saint, even Buddha himself, will not, as a personality, survive
death.”</p>
<p>But if this is so, how can there be rebirth? If there is no soul, how
can it pass into other existences, to be punished for the sins of this
embodi- ment? Here is the weakest point in Buddha’s philosophy; he never
quite faces the contradiction between his rationalistic psychology and
his uncritical acceptance of reincarnation. This belief is so universal
in India that almost every Hindu accepts it as an axiom or assumption,
and hardly bothers to prove it; the brevity and multiplicity of the
generations there suggests irresistibly the transmigration of vital
force, or — to speak theo- logically — of the soul. Buddha received the
notion along with the air he breathed; it is the one thing that he seems
never to have doubted.™ He took the Wheel of Rebirth and the Law of
Karma for granted; his one thought was how to escape from that Wheel,
how to achieve Nirvana here, and annihilation hereafter.</p>
<p>But what is Nirvana? It is difficult to find an erroneous answer to
this question; for the Master left the point obscure, and his followers
have given the word every meaning under the sun. In general Sanskrit use
it meant “extinguished”— as of a lamp or fire. The Buddhist Scriptures
use it as signifying: ( i ) a state of happiness attainable in this life
through the complete elimination of selfish desires; (2) the liberation
of the individual from rebirth; (3) the annihilation of the individual
consciousness; (4) the union of the individual with God; (5) a heaven of
happiness after death. In the teaching of Buddha it seemed to mean the
extinction of all indi- vidual desire, and the reward of such
selflessness — escape from rebirth.” In Buddhist literature the term has
often a terrestrial sense, for the Arhat, or saint, is repeatedly
described as achieving it in this life, by acquiring its seven
constituent parts: self-possession, investigation into the truth, en-
ergy, calm, joy, conce ntration, and magnanimity.™ These are its
content, but hardly its productive cause: the cause and source of
Nirvana is the extinction of selfish desire; and Nirvana, in most early
contexts, comes to mean the painless peace that rewards the moral
annihil ation of the self.” “Now,” says Buddha, “this is the noble truth
as to the passing of pain. Verily, it is the passing away so that no
passion remains, the giving up, the getting rid of, the emancipation
from, the harboring no longer of, this</p>
<p>43 6 the story of civilization (chap. xv</p>
<p>craving thirst””— this fever of self-seeking desire. In the body of
the Master’s teaching it is almost always synonymous with bliss,” the
quiet content of the soul that no longer worries about itself. But
complete Nirvana includes annihilation:, the reward of the highest
saintliness is never to be reborn.“</p>
<p>In the end, says Buddha, we perceive the absurdity of moral and psy-
chological individualism. Our fretting selves are not really separate
beings and powers, but passing ripples on the stream of life, little
knots forming and unraveling in the wind-blown mesh of fate. When we see
ourselves as parts of a whole, when we reform our selves and our desires
in terms of the whole, then our personal disappointments and defeats,
our varied suffering and inevitable death, no longer sadden us as
bitterly as before; they are lost in the amplitude of infinity. When we
have learned to love not our separate life, but all men and all living
things, then at last we shall find peace.</p>
<p>V. THE LAST DAYS OF BUDDHA</p>
<p>His miracles — He visits his father’s house— The Buddhist</p>
<p>monks — Death</p>
<p>From this exalted philosophy we pass to the simple legends which are
all that we have concerning Buddha’s later life and death. Despite his
scorn of miracles, his disciples brewed a thousand tales of the marvels
that he wrought. He wafted himself magically across the Ganges in a
moment; the tooth-pick he had let fall sprouted into a tree; at the end
of one of his sermons the “thousand -fold world- system shook.”” When
his enemy Devadatta sent a fierce elephant against him, Buddha “pervaded
it with love,” and it was quite subdued.” Arguing from such pleasantries
Senart</p>
<p>The Buddhist Scriptures paint a pleasing picture of him. Many
dis-</p>
<p>ciples gathered around him, and his fame as a sage spread through the
cities of northern India. When his father heard that Buddha was near
Kapila- vastu he sent a messenger to him with an invitation to come and
spend a day in his boyhood home. He went, and his father, who had
mourned the loss of a prince, rejoiced, for a while, over the return of
a saint.</p>
<p>BUDDHA</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>Buddha’s wife, who had been faithful to him during all their
separation, fell down before him, clasped his ankles, placed his feet
about her head, and reverenced him as a god. Then King Shuddhodhana told
Buddha of her great love: “Lord, my daughter (in -law), when she heard
that you were wearing yellow robes (as a monk), put on yellow robes;
when she heard of your having one meal a day, herself took one meal;
when she knew that you had given up a large bed, she lay on a narrow
couch; and when she knew that you had given up garlands and scents, she
gave them up.” Buddha blessed her, and went his way.”</p>
<p>But now his son, Rahula, came to him, a nd also loved him. “Pleasant
is your shadow, ascetic,” he said. Though Rahula’s mother had hoped to
see the youth made king, the Master accepted him into the Buddhist
order. Then another prince, Nanda, was called to be consecrated as heir-
apparent to the throne; but Nanda, as if in a trance, left the ceremony
unfinished, abandoned a kingdom, and going to Buddha, asked that he,
too, might be permitted to join the Order. When King Shuddhodhana heard
of this he was sad, and asked a boon of Buddha. “Whe n the Lord
abandoned the world,” he said, “it was no small pain to me; so when
Nanda went; and even more so with Rahula. The love of a son cuts</p>
<p>through the skin, through the hide, the flesh, the sinew, the marrow.
Grant, Lord, that thy noble ones may not confer the ordination on a son
without the permission of his father and mother.” Buddha consented, and
made such permission a prerequisite to ordination.”</p>
<p>Already, it seems, this religion without priestcraft had developed an
order of monks dangerously like the Hindu priests. Buddha would not be
long dead before they would surround themselves with all the para-
phernalia of the Brahmans. Indeed it was from the ranks of the Brah-
mans that the first converts came; and then from the richest youth of
Benares and the neighboring towns. These Bhikkhus, or monks, practised
in Buddha’s days a simple rule. They saluted one another, and all those
to whom they spoke, with an admirable phrase: “Peace to all beings.”*
They were not to kill any living thing; they were never to take anything
save what was given them; they were to avoid falsehood and slander; they
were to heal divisions and encourage concord; they were always to show
compassion for all men and all animals; they were to shun all amuse-
ments of sense or flesh, all music, nautch dances, shows, games,
luxuries,</p>

<p>idle conversation, argument, or fortune-telling; they were to have
nothing to do with business, or with any form of buying or selling;
above all, they were to abandon incontinence, and live apart from women,
in perfect chastity . 85 Yielding to many soft entreaties, Buddha
allowed women to enter the Order as nuns, but he never completely
reconciled himself to this move. “If, Ananda,” he said, “women had not
received permission to enter the Order, the pure religion would have
lasted long, the good law would have stood fast a thousand years. But
since they have received that permission, it will now stand fast for
only five hundred years .” 80 He was right. The great Order, or Sangha ,
has survived to our own time; but it has lon g since corrupted the
Master’s doctrine with magic, polytheism, and countless
superstitions.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his long life his followers already began to deify
him, despite his challenge to them to doubt him and to think for them-
selves. Now, says one of the last Dialogues,</p>
<p>the venerable Sariputta came to the place where the Exalted One</p>
<p>was, and having saluted him, took his seat respectfully at his
side,</p>
<p>and said:</p>
<p>“Lord, such faith have I in the Exalted One that methinks there</p>
<p>never has been, nor will there be, nor is there now, any other,</p>
<p>whether Wanderer or Brahman, who is greater and wiser than the</p>
<p>Exalted One … as regards the higher wisdom.”</p>
<p>“Grand and bold are the words of thy mouth, Sariputta” (an -</p>
<p>swered the Master); “verily, th ou hast burst forth into a song
of</p>
<p>ecstasy! Of course, then, thou hast known all the Exalted Ones of</p>
<p>the past, . . . comprehending their minds with yours, and aware</p>
<p>what their conduct was, what their wisdom, . . . and what the</p>
<p>emancipation they attaine d to?”</p>
<p>“Not so, O Lord!”</p>
<p>“Of course, then, thou hast perceived all the Exalted Ones of</p>
<p>the future, . . . comprehending their whole minds with yours?”</p>
<p>“Not so, O Lord!”</p>
<p>“But at least, then, O Sariputta, thou knowest me, . . . and hast</p>
<p>penetrated m y mind?” . . .</p>
<p>“Not even that, O Lord.”</p>
<p>“You see, then, Sariputta, that you know not the hearts of the</p>
<p>Able, Awakened Ones of the past and of the future. Why, there-</p>
<p>fore, are your words so grand and bold? Why do you burst forth</p>
<p>into such a song of ecstasy ?” 87</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) BUDDHA</p>
<p>And to Ananda he taught his greatest and noblest lesson:</p>
<p>439</p>
<p>“And whosoever, Ananda, either now or after I am dead, shall be</p>
<p>a lamp unto themselves, and a refuge unto themselves, shall betake
themselves to no external refuge, but, holding fast to the Truth as</p>
<p>their lamp, . . . shall not look for refuge to any one besides
them-</p>
<p>selves — it is they . . . who shall reach the very topmost height!
But</p>
<p>they must be anxious to learn!” 88</p>
<p>He died in 483 b.c., at the age of eighty. “Now then, O monks,”
he</p>
<p>said to them as his last words, “I address you. Subject to decay are
com - pound things. Strive with earnestness.” 88</p>
